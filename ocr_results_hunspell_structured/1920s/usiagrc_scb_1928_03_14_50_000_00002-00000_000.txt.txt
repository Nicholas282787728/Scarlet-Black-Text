SAII TALE OF A CARTEL.

Did you ever hear the story of the obliging camel?
it seems that one of these statély beasts of hur-
den was being loaded for a lung caravan trip across the
desert. The owners of the caravan found that they
had quite a bit of surplus baggage to take. and as the
camel in question was of sturdy dimensions and had a
kind race, they started to put some of the extra weight

upon him, Fil t they hoisted up a little oni-il by means
of lime mm id l‘t derrick, . ntl llnilc it List lo the camel’s
back. Our animal heio ltcpt clm lug his cud ith pl‘ltll‘
at the contidenco thus rcposed in him. and signiiied li.
do 'l'e to army on even greater load.

. (:\L Lilo, (ll‘n’c . lifted up a couple Oi Sllclis rlf wheat,
each or them about the heit or a moderate ' ed tolllh—
stone, and added them to the camel‘s; burden Still he
made no complaint, and it his back began to mg it little
hit in the middle. no one noticed it.

The next item to go up uas a mammoth bale oi hay.
which was tied to the camel’s hack without evicting even
the tlicker oi nn eyelash ii-om him, Even then all
might lliuc been well had not one or the owners, who
was a Scotelnnan, picked up a tiny wisp ot liny that was
ilutteriiig about on the ground, and tossed it onto the
camel's back. The extra weight did the business. and
the noble ship oi the desert crashed to the ground like a
Phi Beta Kappa thinking an examination.

uona . a great many students get started out by

’ug a icw outside activities, until like the obligiiig
camel they get overloaded with extra tasks, imnicde
ly they will begin to kid themselves into the nohon that
“book—learning" is the minor part oi college, and that
the "associations" and “rich experiences" are the vital
thing But the student who is going to get the most
value out ot the rather large sum spent tor a college edu—
cation is the one who chooses his course oi study 'ilitll
a deiinite aim in mind, and devotes every energy to get-
ting as much practicable good as he can out or the sub-
jects he studies. The outside activities are valuable as
side-line, but only as sidelines.

OUR vrlltsATIli}: LIBRARY.

One should always be in iavor of any means. method
or manner which will aid in thc iurtherance oi romance.
For that reason, we are not going to complain (or at
least not very muCh) because the library-l in addition to
its tunction as a haven of knowledge tor the earnest stus
dent, is also serving as a kind or chunimy resort where
gay souls can gather around a table and keep up the
spirits at those around them with much pleasant chatter,

Needless to say. this makes the library a very pleas-
ant place to spend the afternoon (or evening), especially
it one has only a moderate amount of stiidyiog to be
done. We suggest in all kindness oi spirit, wouldn't it
help it the student could only learn to pass the evening
by gazmg tondly at the torm ot his loved one as she
worked busily on a report, instead ot disturbing her and
those around them with all-too ireouent remarks in-
tended, doubtless, to cheer her up in case study becomes
odious?

sonal reactions which may become in—
tensitied or dimmed with time.

We felt that Cecil Helm as Roy
Lone, the "personality"man and lov-
er together with Constance Brown as
“Billie Moore, the misguided dancer.
played their parts unusually well as
did Donald Kirke, who portrayed Steve
Crandall, the bogus hotter and egg
man. The chorus was good and we
wished that more dances might have
been giving for the paying audience
rather than the imaginary one.

Miss mice Outstanding

The outstanding character or the
play, however, was Vivian Vance, who
played the part of Pearl, sweetheart
of ”Sear” Edwards, gangster who was
killed by Steve Grandell. Miss Vance's

tective. Rather than riding on his
character, Langill chose to get all he
could out ot the role and yet keep
himself well in hand. These two acts
on better than the rest because their
parts demanded it.

Seldom does one see such a hit of
Character work as was done by Jules
Bennett in the part of Nick Veddls,
proprietor of the cabaret.

We hope that this is but the tirst
of the better type of road show which
will be billed for Grinnell.

AN ADDITION TO CAMEL SMOKE-LURE

 

W): SUBMIT the sad case of the freshman in zoology, who, when asked to

describe a camel, said,

“A camel is what you wish you were smoking while

you try to think of the right answerer” He flunketl zoology—but he knew his

cigarettes. For in time of trial or time of joy, there’s no friend like Camels.

The subtle inﬂuences of choice iohneeos upon the smoke-spots of mankind

have been carefully snidied, identiﬁed, and blended smoothly inlo Camels

sine ﬁnest of cigarettes. And we’ll bat an aiknﬂitch on this: Camels have

just the taste and aroma to pack your smoke-spot with the “ﬁll-fullmont”
