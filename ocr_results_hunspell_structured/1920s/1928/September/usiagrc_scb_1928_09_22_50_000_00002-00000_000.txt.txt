The Grinncll SCARLET AND BLACK wishes to
yelcome the class or 1932, new students \l‘hu ivill be
enrollcd in upper classcs and the ncw members ot the
faculty. We hope that your stay in Grinuell will streng—

oiir conviction in a liberal arts education and
your faith in Grilmell We hope that this first year at
Grinnell and the years that are to {allow shall lie trir
ly countcd as the happiest of your life. We could wish
you no more.

It has bcsn said that no other group receives as
much advice and beads it loss than the freshmen. If
this is true, our bit or advice would be useless. Huw~
ever, ire do not believe that all ireshmen scorn advice.
Too many or the class or 1931 developed into potential
leaders in their chosen lines'to substantiate the charge
that all freshmen are heedless of advice. Perhaps some
or the things we suggest have been repeated to you
many times. It they have, so much the better. You will
realize its soundness.

The transition from high school to college is abrupt.
You are thrown on your own in school work, in your
living habits, in the expenditure of money and in your
recreation. Except tor the time spent in classes your
time is your own. You can waste it or you can utilize
every moment to an advantage. That is a matter of
your own desire.

In uie majority of cases this will be the tirst time

lor many or you to live any place but at home. You u- l
be responsible ior thc appearance or your rooms, You
\\'lll have your own allowance to spend. These are a
[div of the things LhaL Will be different (or the [resh-
inon. The manner in wliich'yoii use your time, care tor
your rooms, spend your allowances, cugagc in recrea-
tion and participate in activitics is lnrgcly going to tler
tcrmlne how you will conduct yourselves when you
talrc that one iiirtlier step into life when college is
Over Habits are liieloiig and good lilthits arc greatly
to be dcsircd.

One other change will be the tact that the average
ircshman is a little ﬁsh in a big pond here, while at
home he was a big lisli in a little pond. While the dorm
parison is homely, it conveys the thought. You may have
been the editor at your school publication, caste in the
leading role oi the school play, the star athlete or
the social leader of your class Practically every mom
bcr oi the iresiuuan class can claim soiiie distinction
or that sort, At college you must try out with others as
good as yoiirscli. You may be successlul in being elect-
ed to some Organization, more lilrelr you will sail the
iii-st time. The man or woman who is uiiiclr to recog»
nize this tact and begins to adjust himsell or herseli
to the change will be the first to assume the leader's
responsibility.

We hope that this fatherly advice has not sounded
too pedantic. Its soundness will be veriiicd by the stu—
dent leaders on the campus. They did not succeed the
lirst time in their endeavor to “make" a certain organ}
zation. However. they pcrscvercd and recognized the
value or adjustment. Again we wish you the happy year
we are sure you will rind at Gi

Each year as the old stiidcuts return and the how
students collie tor the first time some innovation or
improvement greets the lormcr and is taken as a matter
of course by the lattcr. So in the matter of house hosts
ossos the presence oi those women will be something
new aml radically diilcrcnt to the older students. To
the freshmen it will ho a part of the college they are
just bcginning to know. in either case or in both cases
this innovation moi-its attentlou

The college has made a carotul selection at appl
cants ior this position. We helieve that wise selections
have been made and the SCARLET AND BLACK wishes
to join with the college as n wholc in welcoming our
house hostesses to Griuncll.

At best the institution oi house hostesses is an ex-
periment. Conditions in the dormitories in the past tew
years havc made such action necessary. The presence
or these women, all or whom know that rare quality
or mother love and boys, will undoubtedly stimulate
social activities, will be more conducive to nuicter study
conditions and will be a stendying influence on dormitory
life.

However, it has been said that this is an cxperl-
ment. lee all experiments it is going‘ to be watched
closely and attached by the few who fall to adjust
themselves to changing conditions. The success or falls
ure oi the scheme rests with the men. it is the ludiﬁds
ual duty of each man to make life in his building as
pleasant as possible for his house hostess and in return
she is ready and willing to do her part. With that spirit
at co-operation, iriendliness and tolerance the plan can-

not fall.
