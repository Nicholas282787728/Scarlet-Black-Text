In pointing out the fact that America

Mr. Gilkey urged Americans to view

the old, being suspicious o[ anything
now, while the progressives adhere
to the opposite view—point, forgetting
llle importance or the past.”

The dangers of believing in sweep-
ing ncguiisns in prcierencc to a poslr
tive statemcni wcrc emphasized by
Mr. Gilkey. The positive values oi
things that are both old and new arc
immeasurable. It is advisable to be
skeptical when a conservative asserts
that anything new is oi no value or
when a progressive states the useless
ness ut‘lhe old. The tendency oi the
modern generation is to follow the
progres ives. iorgelting the basic
foundations at his that belong to the
past

there are whole chapters in ith s.
tianity that one can not understand
unless they are used in terms oi the
present tense," \ir. Gilkcy remarked.
"In conversing with a number oi
Moslems in lnilia they asked me to
lJTecome one oi them. They told me
that the very heart of their religion
was their belief in tllei God As omni.
present, existing now as always. The
present tense is the elernnl tense or
the Christian religion also,”

The speaker emphasized the fact that
the secret oi the Inc and power of re
ligion is based on tile past. Religion
lei . thc old and responds simr
ulldneously lo the new. The ildme or
religion sometimes collgeais, giving
the appearance or true religion, but

’whcil examined is still and cold.

“To keep ibis i‘lnme burning is
the object oi ihc Christian i-cliglmt or
today," - Gilkey added.

ARTMAN WOULD INTRODUCE OBJECTIVE
AND PURPOSE INTO CHURCH OF TODAY

“I wish churches could take their
leaders off on an island and debate
With them ior three or tour days on
America and world life, on what
they are trying to achieve, on What
they are going to major in. ii this
could be done, I think there would
not he so much purposclessposs, such
a lack of objective in the Churches
today." concluded Dr. J. M, Artmsn or
Chicago, in an address this morning,
before a. mass meeting or the Congre<
gniional Fellowship Conierence in the
A. R. H. auditorium. The subject oi
Dr. Artmnn's talk was "The Task of
Religious Education."

Dr. Artman gsve. as he sees them,
the [our groups oi American church-
men . ‘

The largest group is that which has
the objective oi "getting bible know.
ledge into the minds oi pupils. To
know is not to do," said Dr. Artmnn.
“We come across people with know-
ledge, who cannot do. Thereiore this
great objective, While it is fine, is not
suiiiclent."

The second large group maintains
that the‘goal oi religious education is
to make people good churchmen. This
attitude, the speaker said, while it

 

has value, s not all sufficient.

The third group thinks oi a church.
man as a medium {or carrying on the
doctrines and creeds of the church.
‘This body never asks ior intelligence,
but merely that the individual accept
what the other fellow takes. The
Creative mind is drowned and dam»
med “D."

The last group is that which trains
people who can be depended on in
Situations "The reason why we can
call Jesus a Savior," Dr. Arlmnn con—
tinued, “Is not because oi His divine
birth , but because he conducted him-
scli so adequately that we can lmnk
on His conduct now.”

The rest oi Artman’s address was
devoted to the quoslion of laws and
the recent American attitude against
them. The churches and schools are
not aroused about the matter, and
their teachings contain no approach
to this question.

“Churches sho ld begin With the
pastors in reli ous education, not
with boys nnd girls," said Dr. Art<
mun. ~ .
Dr. Artman continued his discussion
in an arternoon lecture, “The Conduct
oi Worship." '

GILKEY lﬂlﬂﬂllES A
'BﬂlHﬂlllllUﬂE

Tells Theologians, Students If

To “Either-or” View.

point towards all iiclds oi luunnn ac-
tivity. Dr. Charles w. Gill: pdslor
oi the Hydc Park Bapti t church, Chi.
cngo. opened the Gems Memorial
lecture series yesterday morning in
Herrick chapel. speaking on “Dilem-
masiTl'ue and False." Dr. Edwurd
A. Steiner iniroduccd the speaker.

Truth Likn Sphere.

“Truth is so wealthy as to need

ressious,” said Dr. Gilkey.

"nut truth is like n spllcreiyou can-

not see all ci it in one light. Ii this

sphere be our cwn globe, the situa-

tion is one at inndamcntel import

encc, ior to take one view oi any

iicld of human activity and thought is
islse.

“Because oi the fact that in theol.
sgy we state a question so that either
an niiirmaiive or a negative answcr
must be given, iovgotting all thc
vistas of unexplored reality between,
dilemmas seemingly true but really
iaisc are presented. Thus we‘ ask: Is
iJesus human or divine; is God solely
n creature oi hunmn thought or no“
It is largely in the inadequacy oi the
iormation oi such questions as these
that ibe dilemmas arise. Not under
the iuilucnce oi theology. but in the
image or our Lord Jesus Christ do we
grow fastest.

Undergraduates Not Experienced,

."Studenls are not‘ capable oi dc-
ciding great religious questions from
the standpoint 'eithor this or that,”
affirmed the speaker, “ior underv
graduates have not yet found lllemc
selv s within the greatest nrens oi
reli inn. They have laced neither
lure, nor marriage. nor iniluve nor
death. The great issues or lile are
settled on the (1 mg line."

Personality requires the “bath»zl.nrl"
View oi life, according to Dr. Gilkey,
for in its very nature it is the recon-
ciliniion oi apparently opposite poles
oi llie. This is the constant enigma
oi personality; its feet are in the mire
but its head is in the clouds. Such
genius us Abraham Lincoln and Bee-
thoverl showed is the expression of
living personality; in lesser folk the
polarity or personality fiills apart.

“When you approach Jesus ircm
this viewpoint,” said the speaker.
“you begin to see l-Iis magnitude.
Hear ihc sound or His whip oi cards
in the temple: hear His voice: 'vc
generntion oi vlpers.‘ Here Was a mu
who combined pure goodness with n
courageous spirit of moral adventure.

“For the present and future gener-
ations, this ’both—and' policy has
great consequences. We oi the lwcn-
tieth century boast that this is the
greatest epoch in man's history. This
generation is the most ‘lllgh hat’ or
all. As a mutter or fact, we hnve not
lived nearly long enough in this Cen-
tury to judge its true value."

“As {or the races," stated Dr. GIL
key in conclusion, "sitcr you have
once been in the Orient. you can never
believe any one race to be deﬁnitely
superior to another, ii, taking Josus'

The Student Court, represented by

the men students of Grinnell assem-

to a lack DI co-oilel-atiou among the

Leah Pratt, To Sing
Tonight, Is Praised :
For DeepﬁContralto.

Leah Pratt. contrslto, who will ap-
penr in recital at Herrick chapel at
eight o'clock ibis evening. was re-
cently described by the Chicago Daily
News as “An American artist who
has a distinguished career beiore
her.” Her concert tonight will be
presented under the auspices.of the
Grinnell school of music, oi which she
has been a faculty' member for the
last two years. .

Although hiiss ‘Fratt has many
times delighted local audiences with
her rich, deep contrsltn solos, to—
night’s concert will be her first re—
citnl in Grinnell. She will conclude
her program with "The Song.oi the
Robin Woman (Slliule\vls)” by Cad—
man, which she sang in Chicago. At
that time, the Chicago Evening Amer-
ican rcmnrked: "one must extol Lean
Pratt for her chnrncterizantion and
vocalization ol' the Shenewis role.”

On another occasion the same [la-
per remarked: “Leah Prat seems to
reveal new vocal benutios at each suc-
cessive appearance. Her tone is gen-
i-ously warm and resonant, iinding ils
triumphant wry above the orchestra,
and blending beautifully in ensemble.
Her solo“Fnc ut Pal‘tem’ won for her
A double 'round’ oi applause.”

The Milwaukee Evening Sentinel
said oi her singing: “A rich deep eon—
tralto. 'Oh Rest in the Lord’ was gi .
on with iinc ieeling and tenderness . . .
helped to make the periormnuce a
most noteworthy one." The Waco
(Tux) NewsJTribune remarked of
her: “Most dramatic of all characters

and in her prominent role she im»
proved to the iull the opportunity tor

Tonight Miss Pratt will be accom-
