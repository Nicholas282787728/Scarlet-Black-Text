Drama of Orient.

The cast of“"l‘he Gods oi the Moun-
tain the Dunsany play which tho
Experimental Theatre will present
Friday evening, February 17, consists
almost entirely ol men. The char-
acters are oriental types, many of
them grotesque and weird. The story
of the play centers around sevcu pro-
fessiollal beggars \viiuse ingenuity for
gaining a livelihood leads them to
cope with the ieariui gods oi green
jade,

ls Duusiuly’s Best.

“The Gods of the Mountain," Lord
Dunsany’s best play, is one of Stuart
\Valker's collection or Portluaniean
Plays. Several years ago. Mr. w
or put this play and his equally tam»
ous "Book of Job" on the road for o.
season. The companies made an at
tensive tour of the United Sttes, play-
ing to many mid-western audiences
who received the plays with enthus—
iasm. since that time "The Gods of
the Mountain" has been popular for
production at experimental centers
Where the complicated sets can be
planned and constructed in student
workshops.

Set Erectell.

The advanced class in play Produc»
tion’has been working on "The Gods
of the Mountain" since before Christ-
mas. A permanent set has been con—
structed and has already been erects
ed for rehearsals on the Colonial thea-
tre stage.

“The Gods of the Mountain" is
poweriui play with much allegorical
implication. As is characteristic of
Lord Dunsany's plays, the whole plot
of the play represents an idea—the
mystery. the Wierdness of the orient,
the sweep of the action all go to make
the play a powertul one.
