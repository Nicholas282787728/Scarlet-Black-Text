The Pioneer's best bet in the llalfs
mile is Hoffman, who turned in a 2:02
performance last year. but Barnes,
just beginning his collegiate compe-
pction and with equally fast time to
his credit, must be reckoned with,

prospect in the field events, but Davis

while not as strong in the sprints,
Grinnell’s prospects here include sevs

Valley Moot Stunt.

Besides the meet this Saturday at
South Bend, the remainder of the in-
door schedule for the Pioneers inn
eludes the annual Missouri valley in-

March 9710. where Coach Duke will
enter a full sound, and the Illinois Re-

The outdoor schedule will open with
the annual Home Meet. April 14.
closely followed by the Kansas Re-

April 27-28. On May 5, a dual with
Carleton will be held at Northfield,
while on May 12, a triangular with
Drake and Ames will occur at Ward
field. Ttic season proper will end
with the annual Missouri Valley meet
at Lincoln, Nebraska, on May 1849,

will take at least three men to the Na—

Ancient Rivals Fight for Seventh
Place in Valley Standings
As Season Ends.

GORNHUSKERS WIN 35 T0 16

Pioneers Register Fourth Straight
Victory in Beating Bears
Saturday 25-23,

Tonight Grinnelt plays Drake. The
game cannot alter the Missouri Vat-
ley title of Iowa, which Grinnelt has
already clinched by winning two
games from Amos and one from
Drake. But it will materially affect
botti Grinnelt's and Drake's standings
in the wtiole conference. 1f the Bill!-
dogs win, they havc a clear title to
seventh place in valley ratings; if
Grinnelt wins, she will lie in tic for
seventh place.

If the showings in this “eek’s
games indicate anything, as theY
probably do not, Drake is the ove -
whelming favorite because of tier w
over Missouri, who stands second in
in ,Vatlcy percentages, while Gl'illnell
lost to Nchn, a last night by a wide
margin. If past history counts, and
there is every reason to believe it
doesn't, the Pioneers have already
won hands down. Grinnelt won all
the games in the first ten or fifteen
years of competition between the two
schools tlicn Drake iron the next
seven. Grinnelt has won as. i, lta~
be she has begun ditotllct' “liming

Bears Fall Victim to
Pioneer Onslaught

Continuing their sweep toward the
championship of the cellar division of
the Valley basketball series, the Pier
necrs won their fourth in their last
five encounters by defeating Washing-
ton university Saturday night 23 to
25,

The battle was tense all the,
the Bears in the lead most of the
time. Neitiier team scored much in
the opening minutes and the game 11
to 14 in favor of the st. Louis cagers
at the half. The Pioneers continued
to trail until the last four or five
minutes when they won by a last
minute rally.

One of the features of the game
was the distribution of baskets, No
illeyer on either team made more than
two . Coggeshall tied with Meyer of
Washington as high point man. Both
made two baskets and two free
throws. Captain Davis, tngrsm and
Fall of Grinnell and Captain Eckert
and Stanford of Washington each
made two baskets.

Eckhftrt’s guarding of Coggeshalt
was one of the factors in Saturday’s
game. He held the Grinnelt forward,
who had made fifteen points against
Missouri the night before, to six
points and at the same time contribut-
