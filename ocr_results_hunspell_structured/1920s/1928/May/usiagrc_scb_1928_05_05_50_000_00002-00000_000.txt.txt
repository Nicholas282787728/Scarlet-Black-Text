SCIENTISTS MEET.

Grinnell scollegc is glad to be host this week-
end to the torts-second annual meeting of the, Iowa
Academy of Science. The convention has gathered to-
gether the outstanding men and women of the state
in scientific fields; men and women who are making
constant and valuable contributons in research aiid
experimental work.

Departments ot botany, chemistry, mathematics.
physics, psychology, geology, and zoology are repre‘
sented at the meeting. Papers were given both yester-
day and today at the section meetings telling of the
work done, experiments made, and opinions formed by
various scientists as a result of their research,

There is no field that attords so great an Opportun-
ity for experimentation and creative work as that of
Science. No one need take another's word but may
'Work out the problem for himself., The divergence of
opinion which often results serves only to stimulate
interest and open the ﬁeld to a. greater number. since
each opinion is respected regardless of whether it is
accepted, the competition such controversies result in
is keen and usually leads to discoveries of value.

The value of scientific Work is, of course. iiu-

mcasurable, and cannot be overestimated. in all fields
lllEl'e havc bccn and are being made discoveries which
are of tremendous importance. The results have made
ror rapid progress. Progress in science is rapid. One
discovery paves the way for another which may he or
even greater worth Science stands {or rapid evolution.
Perhaps the most important real'zation a college
student can grasp from sclcntilic wo s the need of an
objective attitude, an impersonal viewpoint open to
conviction. In no place can one better acquire this
attitude than in a laboratory. G. )L A.

crimcnt i to be tried in the dorms next
g or, an 'pcl‘iment, which if it proves successful will
greatly improve dormitory lite for the men. It has
been definitely decided to give each at the six buildings
or the men's Dorms a house mother. This plan will
he inaugurated next semester. The success or failure
of the movement depends pen the type of woman who
undertakes the responslh ,_ If a inothcrly type of
woman can be secured, one who has had a home of
culture. has raised a Inmily, and knows and under»
stands the ways or young men, the house mother plan
will he of bonelit to the men in the dorms. The social
lire ol the Griunell men lacks at present a certain little
refinement that should go with the type of education
Grinncll represents.

Freshmen who come into dormitory life, if they
come with some little knowledge of manners, lose a
good deal of that by the end at the first year, and from
then on keep getting worse. If they/have never had
any manners they never get the opportunity to acquire
them in Grlnncll. It is not only table manners that
are lacking. It is not safe tor a lady to go near the
men's dorms unless the men are warned bclorc hand
that there is a woman in the building, otherwise she is
in danger of being olfendcd by the language which is
not good the majority of the time. One of the strongest,
objections to the house mother plan has been that with
a lady n the huilding the men could not tall: as they
want to; it would hamper their freedom. Griunell
would he better off without that type of man,

With a. lady in each of the buildings one who could
hold the respect of the men, there is no question of
doubt but that' her influence would help to bring hut
some or the qualities of a gentleman in the men of her
building. Not only will It help to improve table and
language manners. but it will offer an opportunity for
the women to become acquainted with the dorms. It
will be possible llnder this new plan to have the build-
ing club rooms open Friday and Saturday nights the
same as the Cottage parlors are, where the men can
bring their dates,

Taking everything into consideration, there is a good
deal to be gained and nothing to he lost in the experi-
ment. But, of course, the whole thing depends on the
type at women who are to be house mothers, The
motherly kind, who will take an interest when a, man is
sick and give him the attention he would receive if he
were home; the kind or mother a man can talk over
his difficulties with, such women will be a great ad-
dition to the men‘s dormitories. The house mother is
not a part of the government of the men; she is to be
a mother in the_truc sense of the word. A. c. A.
