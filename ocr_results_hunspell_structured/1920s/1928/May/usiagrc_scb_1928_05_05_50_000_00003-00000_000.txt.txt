“After smoking the four brands, as they were handed to
me one after another, I discovered_there vyas one that was
noticeably smoother than the others and richer in taste.

”This proved to be an OLD GOLD. I hope I shall be able
to buy them in Paris . . they. are surprisingly free from
any trace of throat irritation and have a delightful aroma

which to me is Very important.”
