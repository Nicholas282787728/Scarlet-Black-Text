By inaugurating what. is called the

Grinnell Forensic has developed a new

which is receiving favorable atten-

Dancing Al: Grinnell Dates Back To
1917; Many Privileges Given Since

With the recent controversy over it
suggested amendment to the constitu-
tion concerning additional social privie
leges still current a statement of the
evolution of dancing on the Grinnell
campus has been issued.

This period ot/evolution dates back
to 1917 when dancing was ﬁrst allowed
as a farm of amusement on the calm
pus and is brought down to the recent-
ly rejected suggestion [Or an unlimited
number of open houses in the men's
halls.

In M rch mi 1917 the faculty de-

“That these lunctions be exclusively

Apparently this was not satisfactory
to the students and so they were sue»
cesstul in having another resolution
passed. It was passed in October of
1:119. It said, "~—That a recreational
period including dancing may be held
each week on Friday or Saturday when
thcrc is no all—college entertainment.
This recreational period shall be
characterized by inlormality ind the

“That private dances or town organs
