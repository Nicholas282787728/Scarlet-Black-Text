“Storm Clouds Gather In India,”
Explains Indian Boycott.

Prot. Wayne Gard or the rtriuncll
facility is the author ot an iulormatire
article in the "Storm Clouds Gather
in India,” which amears in the enr-
rent issue oi the Independent. a na-
tional weehly journal published in
Boston. In this article Mr. Gard dis-
cusses the current political sllllar
lion in India with special relcrence to
the boycott of the Simon commission,
a Parliamentary hody now making an
investigation in lndia.

r. Garrl, who recently spent three
years in India as a correspondent tor
the Associated Press, tells why the
Simon commission was appointed and
explains the ludinn boycott which re-
suited irom the failure at the Brltlsh
to include any Indian members in the
commission The article states that
"not for x years have the people
of India been aroused as strongly
against the British as it present," and
adds that the present threat 01 e
onlic hoycott is particularly disquiet
ing to the British in view of the tact
that their share in India's trade has
clined ten per dent in the last tom-
years.

The tacts presented in the article
indicate that the Indian nationalists
are now inclined to adopt again the
method of nourvlolent non co-opera-
tion which they used with consider-
able success in 1920-22 under the
leadership or M. K Gandhi.
