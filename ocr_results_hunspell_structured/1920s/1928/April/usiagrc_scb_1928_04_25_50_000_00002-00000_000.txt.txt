A LONG 0R SHORT ROAD.

We liked a phrase in Mr. Walkers chapel tall: Monday;
"There is no short road to knowledge." He illustrated it
by telling ol the work of John Sargent but surely it is
just as rrseful to apply in a college course. We believe
there is a truth in it that over-weighs the “snaps" and
“pipes" of the curriculum or the carefully worked out
plans that necessitate reading only a part of the work.

There Is, unquestionably. a difference between a smut:
tering of facts and knowledge. This brings us to the old.
unsolved controversy of general or intensiﬁed courses,
But is not the connection between these, in that out of
the smattering—the hodgepodge of new ideas—We may
ﬁnd some few statements that will Show us this long
road to knowledge

Why not admit that a general course is meant {or
foundation and not for knowledge? would it not he fear
sihle, however, to try to link them by taking some fact
from the smattering and discovering more about it: We
know a student whose two majors are in science and
English but who found an interesting fact in one of his
required courses which be investigated in a detailed man-
ner. It was an entirely new field opened and he found a
‘successiul way to incorporate his research with his \rl'iL
ing which is proving it to be a part of his most valuable
material. This seems to us a rather ideal method of
oomhining the two types of college courses otter-ed. We
should then possess the knowledge that Webster says
“denotes acquaintance with, or clear perception of. facts."
And although the road might be long, it would be pleasant
along the Way.

'l'llll IIO SE MOTHER PLAN.

Shall house mothers be installed in tile dormitories?
This issue now faces the nren of the college. ~lt should
be decided belcre the close of school this spring, in order
l1l.it plans in ldl'llllllutioll ini- the turning semester may
take this prospective new icrtture into account.

Provrded certain qualiﬁcations are met, We heartily
.l or thc project. First, the house mother must be a
woman of high cilpability‘itolerdllt, kindly, cultured, and
digniﬁed. (These qualities we demand, even though the
dormitories are regarded in certain circles as the play-
grouud ot‘ the (ICVIL) Second, slrc mrlst be hired on an
experimental basis; she must be tried on her ability to
get along with the men. This rs very obviously neces-
sary, for a woman who could not obtain the respect and
conﬁdence of the men would a prrorr tail to fulfill the
obligations of her position. Third, the, house mother
must not impair the position at the building governing
bodyidt least, as long as the present form or government
rs in effect.

Presumably, the presence of slrcb an individual in
each of the dormitory units would operate to evoch a
more wholesome environment than obtains under cxl in;
conditions. All or this is strictly consistent with the
theory of the dormitory system, and would mater-rally
aid in bringing success to the now plan of government,
which is Grinriell‘s espccial concern just now.

Let the house mother project he adopted on an ex-
perimcutai basis. Brit, whether adopted or not, let a
decision he Iorthcomiug. That is imperative.

JUNIOR COLLEGES.

The experiences with junior colleges of those who
visited high schools over the state during spring vacation
prompts this brief consideration of the» efficacy 0E such
institutions.

The junior college movement has hen encouraged
by the aternpt on the part of many educational leaders
in recent years to Split the foul , fir college of liberal
arts into two sections by driving a wedge between the
second and third years. President Harper of the Univer-
sity or Chicago was prohably the most influential advo-
cate of the system.

The wor ing out of this plan inevitably changes the
essential character of a college of liberal arts. In a true
college of this type, the natural break comes at the end
of the freshman rather than at the end of the sophomore
year. High school graduates are coming to college for
the most part without satisfactory preparation for college
wor . This situation may as well he recognized frankly
by making the Work of the freshman year a. continuation
of the work of the high school. Final judgment on a
student should be deferred until the end of his freshman
year.

In so far as a junior college attempts to do college
Work it should be limited to this ﬁrst year, and. standard
colleges might well refuse to give Credit beyond the ﬁrst
year for Work done in any institution which is not able to
offer full opportunity for a bachelor’s degree. If this
policy were adopted, the work of the three upper years
could be arranged as it unit, and methods could he ems
ployed Which would be hopeless if used under present
conditions,

Aput from this consideration we might argue that
no junior college can furnish the equipment, the faculty,
the libmry and the opportunities that a liberal arts col-
lege can.

At Grinnell we believe that a large majority of four-
year Students is able to maintain a richer and more
inspiring atmosphere than other types; the incidental
phases are more signiﬁcant.
