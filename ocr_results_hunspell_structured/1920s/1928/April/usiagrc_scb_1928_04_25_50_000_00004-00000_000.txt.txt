trio recent developments in physics
that were discussed below the Science

'l'hcodoie Thomas told about the
sound waves created by Di', Wood or

thin and poi-Icct quart-c c ystal in cans

inunc od‘ it in an oil bath, The vi-
brations or the crystal were trans

the bath. The glass tube burned a
groove in the hand at the person
touching it, due to the friction caused
by the invisible transverse vibrations
The waves were found to have a ti-c-
oriency almost equal to that or radio
waves.
