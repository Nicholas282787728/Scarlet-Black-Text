oi its details. The coiniuittee is com.

Paul Smiley and Ralph Barris.

A meeting of this group was held

the tentative plan they have suggests,

The government under the new sys~
tem institutes some radical changes,
The old Senate and Court would be
abolished. Government would be con.

that the best government is the least
government. The departments as
ganized would lie House roinmirtccs,
