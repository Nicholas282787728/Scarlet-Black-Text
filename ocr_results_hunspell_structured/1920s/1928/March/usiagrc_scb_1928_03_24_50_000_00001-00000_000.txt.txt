“The Last Tea of Tsuki.” presented
in Japanese mood. costume, and set-

Girls- Glee club program given in
Herv cl: chapel last night under the
direction of Prof. George L. Pierce.
A high standard of tone duality, ac—
curacy of pitch, and brightly-varied
interpretation were evidenced in this
number, as they had been exhibited in
“The Blessed Damozel" and through-
out the earlier part of the program.
Tile difficulties of arranging a stage
setting an the chapel platform Were
fairly well overcome with a liberal
use of cherry blossoms, and a lattice.

doubtedly good singing. The solos
were done meladiuusly and “in char-

Hone nuston, and Lcie Stevens.

The instrumental music, which
formed an important striking musical
background for “The Last Tea of
Tsuki," was performed by Prof. David
T Peck and Grace Searv Smith or

John H. Spencer, violincello; Mar-
garet Jean Howell, piano: and Sarah

for “The Last Tea of Tsuki” was com-
posed by Prof. Elias Blum, and the
text by Prof. J. G. Walleser, formerly
of the Grinnell English department.
The opening numbers were three
Old ‘l’elsh, Irish, and English select-
ions sung harmoniously by the club
ensemble. They were “Sweet How

for this group the Glee club sang-
"in lover, He Comes on the Skils."
The piano accompaniments for these

on the program were all well perform.

“Blessed Dnnlozel” Music. New]
Although ”The Blessed Damczel” by
Debussy is c difticnlt number to put
across effectively, the girls presented
it Very creditably. The music is dis—
tinctly modern and still a trifle new
to be fully appreciated by the average
listener. and the poem by Rosettl is
too ethereal to he‘easilss interpreted.
But the artistic possibilities of the
work were brought out by the well-
blended singing of the group, and
the fine Solo interpretations of Mar»

zell and Arline Urban (the Narrator)
The third part of the program in-
cluded two vocal solos by Phyllis
Lehmer. “Valse Ariexta (Romeo and

Juliet)” by Gounod displayed the high ‘

notes of the soloist's voice but was not
as well sung as her second number,
“Echo Song," by Bishop. in the
"Echo Song.” a flute obbligatc was
played by Marion Brimhall. The flute
notes compared so closely with thc
quality of Miss Lellmer's voice as to
provide a decidedly realistic echo and
a delightful effect, evidencing the
good techniuue of both performers.

Library Landscape Architecture
Is One of Two Largest In
America 011 Subject.

rrhe gift yesterday, by Warren H.
Manning of Cambridge, Mass, of the
h nniug Libr‘ 'y of Lnudscnpedrcli'
eciure to G inllell college is declar-
ed by Pres. J. H. T. hlain to be
one 01 the mo, _ guificaut gifts the
college has received in recent years.

This is one of the two largest libi»
[tries in America. on this subject. It
conslsm of all extensive collection of
rare books, plates, plans, pictures and
lantern slides, accumulated through
more than forty years of active work
by Mr. Manning in the study of land-
scape architecture, parks, city plan-
ning, and preservation of natural re-
sources. This material will be his
valuable to all students and workers
in Landscape Art. In the Grinnell
college Library it will be accessible to
the entire Middle West.

Mr, Manning began his work with
Frederick Lew Olmstead, the pioneer
authority in landscape gardening in
this country, and has designed more
tiliin 1500 landscape and regional
plan projects in 42 states. Among his
earlier work was the floral designing
of the Chicago world's fair in 1893.
He has supervised planting on the
Vanderbilt estate at Biltmore, N. c.,
the Rockefeller, Casset, Elkins, Mc-
Cormick, and other estates, as well
as many college grounds and public
works.

Develops “Niltioil‘nl Plan."

For many years b . Manning has
devoted his energy to gathering data
for a system of coordinating the coun-
try's productive agencies known as
tlle “National Plan.” He has made a
survey of the nation's physical re
sources, used and potential, upon
which future policies of conservation
and development may be based. With
this was a classification of land units
according to fitness for special pur-
lioses, power facilities or geological
properties.

The collection which comes to Grin—

ncll includes 2000 lantern slides, 15ml
mounted landscapes and over 500
books.
In placing such a collection in the
ddlc west, the donor has realized
the importance of establishing an art
center in this part or the country.
where it will probably be appreciated
more than if placed in the East.

This gift will materially strengthen
the dept’ll'tlnelitvof Landscape archie

Pictures of Senate,

Rumors that the pictures of the
Men's Court and Senate would not
appear in the 1929 Cyclone were de
clared groundless, Thursday by Joe
McKee, editor of the publication.
McKee's denial followed a confer-
ence with Pres. J. H..T. Mai , who
declared himself in favor of including
the men’s governmcnt pictures despite
the dissolution of the organizations.
President Main declared that since the
government had operated for part of
the year and had effected several im-
provements in campus life, it would
be unfair to omit the pictures, from
1928 organizations.

The photographs will therefore, ape

Sherwood Eddy Declares Students
Are Not Taught How to Think
But What to Think.

RELIGION IS WORLD-WIDE

Speaker Deplores the absence of
the United States In the i ,
League ,of Nations, '.

"Students in America are not
taught how to think, but WHAT to
think; a student goes out El. graduate,
but not an educated man," said Sher-
wood Eddy at seven o'clOCk Thursday
night, in Herrick chapel: his subject
was “The Revolt of Youth~froln
What to What.” He delivered a ser-
ies of talks While he was here Thurs-
day and Friday.

Mr, Eddy gave this statement as the
reason Why the revolt of youth is not
so articulate and highly organized in
America as in other countries.

He gave a. brief historical outline of ’

this widesprentl'hiovement which be-
gan twenty-five years ago in Ger-
many, against the system of education
which was beating men down. In
Russia the movement is highly organ-
ized and powerful,

llllulnclrutos rllhses.

Mr. Eddy enumerated the phases of
the'yonth revolt: (11 against exter-
nal authority imposed from without;
(2) against all sham, unreality, by-
pocrisy; (3) against conventions and
customs; (4) against organized injus—
tice.

"Are you living creatively? Are
you going out to be creative or dese
tl'uctive?” In order to live thus, Mr.’
Eddy asserted, one must live a simple
and sacrificial life, and must practice
brotherhood [of all. '

As s result of taking part inc war
which left ten million diseased refu-
gees, ltir. Eddy began to see that war
was hell. ”Resist evil with good," he
suit, “and war will fail . . For my»
self I am done forever with war. I.
will take no destructive part in any
future war." He believes in world
court, arbitration, good w 1.

"Are you willing to live a life of
sacrificial sharing?” concluded sher-
wood Eddy, “to practice equal bro-
therhood wltliout race prejudice, to
stop war, to make peacel"

After the lgctnre Mr, Eddy held a
meeting for the men in which he gave
them advice on personal problems.
lie,held a similar meeting for women
at one o'clock yesterday,

Religion ls
Loyalty to Best

“Religion is loyalty to the best;
whenever you seek for truth, good-
ness, or beauty you have passed over
the threshold into religion," said
Sherwood Eddy, prominent author
and lecturer, in his chapel talk Fri-
day on “Ciin We Still Believe in ne-
ligion?”

"Tl search for truth," be conti -
ued, “is universal. In all my cxpe
once, I have never encountered any
nation or tribe so low that. they had
no religion. In every shade of belief
and unbelief, I have recognized some
spiritual force at Work.”

Inner Experience Real.

The spiritual force manifests itself
as an inner experience, the lecturer
asserted Faith gotten as a result of
an inner experience is real vihile the
faith we accept because oiir fathers
did is second-hand. We alone are rese
ponsible for the occurrence of that
inner experience, for we choose our
own environment and assimilate what
that environment contains. If we
choose one of jazz and sensuality, we
may get B. “short circllited" content-
ment but not a soul-satisfying ex—
perience, If we choose an environ~
ment of truth and religion we find
God. >

Some people doubt the existence of
God, Mr. Eddy continued. They do it
because His existence cannot be dem-
onstrated. Yet the existence of elec-
tricity cannot be demonstarted and
they will accept it. They believe in
it because they have evidence of its
work. is not this ordered universe
evidence of God's work? he asked.
