tie to Drake two weeks ago and went
into the fr. y this afternoon anxious to
wipe out both the stigma of that de-

last year. Marquette, however, has
also suiiered defeat at the hands of
the Bulldogs and has spoilt the lost
two weeks regaining prestige by win-
ning from iklahoma and tielng Holy

The fact that the ground is slippery
making the chances for a scoreless tie
great. There will he few chances for
open play as dnmpness will make
passing and open-field running diffi—

Both teams enter the field with al-
most trill strength. Heldvidge, a cent-
ter, may be bothered with an elbow
which lie dislocated in the Drake
game, but there are no other importr
ant injuries in the local camp. Mar--
