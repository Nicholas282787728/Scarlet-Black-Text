“It would be complicated for a

’fThis year we are eliminating an
infair rule from the football res
quirements, Heretofore, a quarter
did not count toward a letter unless
the player participated in every mln-
ute of it. Thus, a man might partic
pate a far longer time than the neces-
sary twelve quarters and still not re:

eive the G simply because he did not
play enough full periods. Now, the
rule calls for a time equivalent to fit»
teen quarters and any minute a grid-
der plays counts toward the reuuired
time.

allowing a coach to substitute as free-
