Lu luiol‘dlu'lll Series.

Although outbit in Wednesday's
game, Building Six managed to scol'c‘
a win over lntngari hall, in one oi the‘
best played games 01 the dormitory
series. The features or the game was
the pitching by alchtiin, rrlio strrrck
out ten men. and the fact that out or
the ten hits garnered by the two teams.l
not one was good for an extra base.

Langan threw a scare into the Dib-
bleites when they ﬁlled the bases in
the last inning with none down. hirt
the next three batters wore retired by
nlclxrin, Seelaird being the only man
to score Outside or: this one inning.
Langan never threatened to score.

In the second E. Jones knocked a‘
hot grounder through second. stole‘
second and third and came on home.
when .uundt made a poor throw to tirsti
in an attempt to catch Enlierton,‘ who
had rolled one down in front of pitch-
el"s box. In the fourth frame Jones
knocked another- hit down the same
lane, and scored when Fullerton was
out at ﬁrst. Gelvin and Richmond got
on gratis, when Seeland made poor
throws to ﬁrst. A sacrifice by lucLain,
and a singel by Sweet, was sulficient
to score the runners and clinch the
same l'ol' Dibble.

Ever Griniieli College student is ill-
tercstcd rn rt good sound method of
adding dollars to his bank account.
Not only the student earning his way
thru college. but every one can use ser—
erdl hundred extra dollars.

The same plan used by Albert G.
Davis is now open to students of Grin-
nell College. The St. Louis business
man who made it possible Mr Davis to
earn $712 in just 40 days knows the
student‘s ﬁnancial handicap. He earned
his way thru college. Now that he is
in a position to do it, he is making it
easy for other students to earn the
money they need.

Thu unusual money making plan
that bellied Davis is too lengthy to
cover in these columns, but he sug
gests that every strident write Mr.

outline the details of this digniﬁed.
business plan to students who are sin-
cere about wanting to earn good
money thru conscientious effort. The
number or students to participate in
this opportunity is limited and l‘lll
should wi e Mr. Rhodes at once. Just
ask for his "College Student's Pro-
