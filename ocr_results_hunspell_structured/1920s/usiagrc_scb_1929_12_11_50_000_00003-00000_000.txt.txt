ls it an art or a science to go to
Des Moines with twenty-four cents
in your pocket, stay over night, eat
three square meals and return to
Grinncll with the same twenty-four
sous? See MacArthur and Kauff-
man for instructions in the technique
of such traveling. They'll warn you
against the extravagance of Jimmy
Davis on such a. trip. He wastes pie
dreadfully, we are told.

We understand that some am~
hitious oo—eds took the trouhle to
prepare a telephone conversation to
test the sense of humor of some of
our more (or less) dignified faculty

 

members. We are proud to announce
that Mr. Wood heads the curve sys-
tem with an A plus.

other members of the English
facultyias well as Grinnell's Senor-
ita—are creating as great a sensa—
tion with their proficiency as Terpe
sichoreans.They are also graded on
the curve system.

No word of mouth or stroke of pen

Can make a student swerve

As can “Although you‘ve earned

an ‘A'

Your grades a ‘B'7

In keeping with the classical spirit
of this column and also suggestive of
the romance in our midst, we print
this prophetic bit of verse from
Shakespeare's “Nelfth Night":

the curve!"

“on Mistress mine, where are you
roaming?

on stay and hear, your true iove's
coming,

That can sing hoth high and low:

Trip no further, pretty sweeting.

Journeys end in lover's meeti‘ng,

Every WISE MAN’S son doth
know.

 

What is love? 'Tis not Hereafter:

Present mirth has present laugh-
ter;

What's to come is still unsure:

ln delay there lies not plenty;

Then, come kiss me, sweet and
twenty,

Youth-s a stuff will not endure.

Kerr, associate members of the or-
ganization, were also guests.

Women in journalism are handi-

them and consequently they must be
skilled in some special phase of news
reporting to secure a position in
competition with men, Miss Fuller
