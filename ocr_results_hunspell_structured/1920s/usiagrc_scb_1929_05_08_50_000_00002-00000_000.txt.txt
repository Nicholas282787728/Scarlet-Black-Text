An interview with President Britt

the nature oi the committees work
it was clear that somé change iron.

Britt iavors comprehensive examina-
tions over the student‘s major course
and said that such examinations
would probably be instituted at Knox
when the details were worked out
more clearly.

ing several Big Ten schools by hold~
ing the contests in iraternity houses

siderable interest was displayed in the
work 01 the Undergladllale Speaking
Exchange by both students and facul-
ty at Knox. It is highly probable that
Griunell will entertain a Knox rep—
resentative next year. Several lacul-
ty members praised the exchznge V'EIy
highly and were or the opinion that
it needed only time to develop into
