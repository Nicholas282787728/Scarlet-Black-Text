Program ls Dazzling

Pianist Has Personality and Taste;
Shows Mastery in Building
Balanced Programs.

By Hugo Goodwin
Professor of Organ

Last Tuesday eevning. November
26th the Grinnell School of Music
Recital course presented Vladimir
Horowitz in pianoforte recital.

It is difficult to speak of the play-
ing of this young Russian without
indulging in superlatives. It is com-
forting ,however. to realize that any
verbal orgy would be but one echo
of the acclaim with which this great
artist has been universally greeted.

Horowitz’ personality is most in-
grating, clean~cut. direct. well<
poised. and modest, with none of the
unpleasant mannerisms that so after:
characterize youthful geniuses.

From a technical standpoint this
pianist is the peer of any virtuoso of
the day; from the standpoint of inter-
pretation his keen' mind and impece
cable taste guide him unerrlngly, ex
cepting on rare occasions when in
sheer joy of dazzling performance he
gives staid 01d Traditions a gentle
p'bke in the ribs:

Program Shows Skill

In the manner of program/build-
ing. Horowitz, is a past master. Sel-
dom has the writer heard a program
that was arranged with more astute-
ness. There was no concession to
popular taste and no rattling of dry
scholastic bones. every number from
the organ like tones of the openingl
fugue to the scintillant variations atl
the close fitted deftly into the planl
of the entire program which was so
arranged as to present a series of
rising climaxes.

The Prelude and Fugue in D Major
arranged by’Busoni from the organ
work by John Sebastian Bach opens
ed the program. In this Horowitz
showed an almost uncanny ability to
differentiate clearly between the
voices; it is an ungrateful number to
play but the artist made it exceeding-
ly effective and seemed to enjoy
threading its contrapuntal mazes.

The Capriccio by Scarlatti .was
taken at a terrific speed but with a
crystalline clarity that would be the
despair of most players.

Player G es Encores

After three works by Johannes
Brahms the enthusiasm of the audi-
ence had reached such a pitch that

had to be added.

The program continued with a
group of Chopin: Ballade in C Minor.
two mazurkas. Impromptu in A- Flat.
Etude in F. and a Waltz in A Flat.
In these. Horowitz displayed a tone
to which no more fitting term than
“living” can be applied. The Ballade
opens with a short phrase that usual-
ly carries little appeal. but through
shcer wizardry Horowitz gave this
phrase all of the subtle nuance that
could be given by a great 'celllst.l

‘Aibyssinia’ ls

Osgood’s Topic

Lecturer-Explorer Will Tell
Secrets of That Nation
Next Tuesday.

“Abyssinia has a numerous religious
people of ancient origin." says Dr.
Wilfred Osgood of the Field museum.
Chicago, who is to tell of his adven-
tures there on next Tuesday evening
a t Herrick chapel. Abyssinia
is not now a closed country. but it
has been closed in the past. and
travel by foreigners throught the
kingdom has been limited because the
people of Abyssinia stood aloof and
did not welcome strangers.

”One is likely to think of Abyssinia
as a colony or province. but. on the
contrary, it is an independent king»
dom and you have to ask permission
of the Abyssinians themselves to en-
ter their country. Because this un-
usual place was little known. it was
chosen by the Field museum as a
likely region for a zoological expedi-
Lion."

Explores Ahyssinin

Dr. Osgood is a graduate of Leland
Stanford university and received his
PhD. degree from the University of
Chicago, For twelve years he was
connected with the United states de-
partment of agriculture and during
that time conducted a hiological in—
vestigation in Alaska. He studied
in European museums from 1906 to
1910. and was special investigator
for our 'government on the "Fur-
Seal" question in 1914. He has been
with the Field museum for many
years.

Dr. Osgood headed the 2000 mile
caravan journey through the heart of
Abyssinia in 1926—27. sponsored. by
the Field/ museum and the Chicago
Daily News. He brought back sev-
eral thousand feet of excellent film
covering the high-spots of his highly

terious country about which so little
was known up to/the time of his ex—
pedition.

The spirit of these seven seniors

in the world that could have stopped
Grinnell from taking that last game.
Had not three inches of snow on the
‘field made anything but straight
football impossible, Grinnell's margin
would probably have been larger than
it was.
All the scoring came in the second
half, after the two teams had engag-

two periods. with Grinnell having the
edge. At the start of the third per-
