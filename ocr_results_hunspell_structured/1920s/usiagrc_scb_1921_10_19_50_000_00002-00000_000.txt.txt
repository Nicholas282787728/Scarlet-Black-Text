AREN’T Tnhrt
In the last issue of the Scarlet and
Black there appears in the “What Do
You Think" column an‘ article
which the author' discusses the hence
ﬁts 01 good music tn the student who

HARRY sci-ss- ..

is attempting to gain a liberal arts
education and criticises the reaction
of the Grinnell student body to the one
portunities that are presented to them
for attaining culture, opportunities
which the majority of them utterly
neglect.

This opens up a subject that has
long been the bone of contention in
universities and colleges
and one that is especially familiar to
the students and iaculty oi Grinnell.

In Grinnell, the apparent Opportun—

recital and lecture courses, consider-‘

an appreciation of them is essential
to the well educated person. A knowl-
edge of current. subjects and questions
of the day is a. vital part Di modern
culture. It is these two phases of the

college education that the authorities

attempt to cover when they bring out, ‘
side artists hero, and yet it is simplyl

a continuation a! the work that is

going on in our halls daily, at work'

that is conducted thru the various
mediums or the classroom, the chapel,
the 'publications, and the library.

Last Friday one or the foremost
American Musicians was here, and.
while he had a splendid audience, the
majority of college students were ah-
sent. This is one oi the faults brought
out in the communication mentioned.
Those who were present received
something vital and something unusu-
al while the absent ones have suff-
ered a great loss or they will never ap-
preciate what they have missed and
will consequently be unchanged by
similar events.

most poets oi Iowa will lecture to the
students and townspeople of Grinneli,

If this is true when applied to the,

Gl'ilmell students are to have an ODV

CHAPEL

“Grant us to see the World as the
artist sees it—apd to pay the price",
was the plea of Professor 0. F, Lavell
at Vespers Friday.

The greatest artists have strive‘n,
not [or great accuracy, but for truth.
And this truth is found not in the pi 1-
less photographic vision which cannot
catch the motion or an ever-changing

warld, but it is found in the artlst's,

Conception which possesses all things
that have been and all that are to he.
Fra Lippo Lippi’s great desire, made

’lrnown by Browningt to discover life's
meaning, has been shared by all great
artists They see lite as having its
lincaning in law, said Proi. Lavell. The
:ﬁreatest artist never rorgot law His
View ol the world is that or the liingr
thorn or God, moving trom chaos toward
,harmony. Prof. Lavell asked that we
Elook not only to the destructive side
or things but to the hopeful, as he re~
‘neated from st Paul, “whatsoever
ithings are just, whatsoever things are
pure, whatsoever things are lovelyw
think on these things."

“Character is a by product whcre
Istudy is the object,” said Prof. d. w.
Gannaway in Monday's capel and is
‘not a thing to be developed conscious-
ly. The primary principle in going to
college is to develop intellectual abil—
tity or thc power to think straight,
‘and in acquiring this, to discriminate.
:rhl lire consists in making the right
choices, hence in our minds must be
the creative principle if we are to be
'cmtucntly successrul men and worm

on."

“Dante was essentially a son of his
own time“ said iss Caroline Sheldon
,in chapel Tuesday morning ”He lived
‘in a time of great men and certainly
has contributed something worth
while it it is read too years after his
:death. Dante wrote lul'gely on two
‘subiects, righteousness and good gave
ernment, and these in his native Italir

 

,nn laiigua°e rather than Latin "

1 After gi ng a short sketch or his
,liie, Miss Sheldon then ‘wcnt on to
idiscuss the works or the great poet
and to tell why they live as they do
today. “Dante was different, his
works stand out," declared the shack-
en when comparing him to other men
of his age, “he gathered all his great
knowledge into banks and passed that
down to us, “because they were worth
tonssing down and living.”
