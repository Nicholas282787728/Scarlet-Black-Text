mous Old English Comedy at
Colonial Theatre.

NOW HOLDING REHEARSALS

Comedy Fului - in Public Tin-«ugh
'ltecent Movie Popularizations
by Sydney Chaplin.

“Charley's Aunt," the famous old
English comedy, will be presented
February 15 at the Colonial theater
and will feature faculty players in a
mid-Victorian setting. in both staging
and costuming this uproarious force
will go back to the days or anti-ma»
cassars and haircloth sofas and will
present a convincing picture of good
old English college days.

Costuming will be of the days of ’95
when mutton-log sleeves, trailing
shirts and old fashioned sailor hats
served to set off the hour glass figure
and make still more awe—inspiring the
impressive coifinre; when the gentle»
men appeared resplendent in peg-top
trousers, embroidered suspenders, de-
tachable cuffs and stiff shirt bosoms.

Ilse College Quarters

In those days society moved through
comfortable drawing roorns draped
with Victorian porﬁeres and lace cur-
tains, and stumbled over what~nots.
easels, and fearful statuary mounted
imposingly on pedestals. Part of the
action takes place in college quarters
among the prints, photographs boxing
gloves, and other accessories of the
Victorian students room. The period
setting will be maintained throughout.

The plot "of this three act comedy of
Brandon Thomas is tanliliar to nearly
everyone as a result of its recent pop~
ularizations in the movies by Sydney
Chaplin. The stage version is, how—
ever, even more entertaining and up-
Toni-ions.

To Be Benefit Performance

The play is being produced by the
Experimental theater with members of
the play production classes taking ac—
tive part, but, as was done last year.
the play will be a cooperative under-
taking with members of the faculty as-
siting in securing necessary proper-
ties and costumesc

The production is again a benefit
performance and the faculty club will

"share with the college band in the
proceeds. Rehearsals have been un—
der way tor some time, but the cast
is not at present complete because
two of the members were forced by
unfortunate circumstances to with-
draw.

Christmas Tour Of Glee Club ls ,
Described as “Complete Success” ,

By George Moore.

Wllen’ the local glee club comes to
the end of a trip, free from debt, with
all members alive, and no signs or in~
cipient insanity, it is accounted a (:0an
plate success. From these standards,
the Christmas trip undertaken by tbc
Men’s glcc club, was more than suc-
cessful. The club not only escnlwd
the sadness or death, but the incorr-
venience of sickness. (That, in spite
of the measles prevalent along the
route.) The financial situation is exe
cellent. if the expression assumed by
Lysle Hartley, manager, when qucse
tinned, is any indication.

Use Parlor Busses

The two Cadillac parlor hIlsseS,
Chartered {or the trill, functioned sur-
prisingly Well, considering their gen-
eral appearance. Two minor disord-
ers caused a. little trouble. The first
was the losing 01' a hub-cap. That hub»
can seemed to be the keystone of the
entire rear axle. Losing ll, had the
same efrect as forgetting to close the
door of 21.11 orphanage —‘ everything
started to run out.

William Miller, soloist and presi—
dent, sprnng the surprise of tbc trip
at his home town, newanee, by having
an unexpected birthday. The club
firsi learned of it, when, at it dinner
given them by the Kewance High
School glee Club, a cake was present-

 

ed him, the gift or his father and mo.
tbcr, In the remarks following the
lireselitailoll. he advised all present to
choke on it. No one didua tribute to
his mother.

GlTl' Seoul)”: Program

, 0n the evening of January ii, the
club sang to a large audience at the
Methodist church of Eyck Island. The
peace and quiet oi the Sabbath even—
ing was shattered by an cntirely secur
lar program. Rousing pirate songs
and sailor songs echoed from the gal-
leries of the church. The concert was
appreciated: due, probably, at least in
part, to the change from the annals
Dated sacred program,

At Davenport, the following even»
ins, Hartley, continuing in tho capacir
tr or manager, walked away with a
ninety dollar check in his pocket, in
spite or a forty dollar audience. No
one was hurt.

The weather on the trip was excel7
lenlithe roads well behaved. 0n the
last day the weather became a little
too warm, resulting in rather muddy
travelling. Much of the one hundred
mile trip from Davenport to Grinnell
was accomplished at a rokish slant.
Skidding was excellent always
straight ahead with no desire on the
part or the overworked busses to take
a rest in the ditch.

llew Publit Speaking Prize

Announcement has been made by the
executive council of Gl'inuell Fol‘elis
that a new public speaking prizc is
being added to the group already or»
fared at Grinnell. It will be known as

debate squad who is adjudged to have

value or about $6, representing the ins
terest on a fund of $100. This is the
alnount which was derived from the
sale of literary society property to
the School of Music, and the award rs

literary societies made to public speak.

With the addition of this fund to the
