Week

:at SWISHER BROS.

While ’tis true we have had an excellent Overcoat business this sea—
son, we ﬁl’ld our stock is much heavier than it should be at this
season of the year—so we are making an extra effort this week to
reduce stock as low as possible. Many late shipments have brought
some of our choicest and most desirable Coats.

YOUR SIZE IS HERE AT THE PRICE YOU WANT TO PAY!

Three of our coldest winter months to come i take advantage of
prices we are making and prepare for them.
