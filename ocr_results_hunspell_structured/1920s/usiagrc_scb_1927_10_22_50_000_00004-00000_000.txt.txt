Intimate Views Of Pioneer
Gridiron Warriors of 1927

Captain Wendell ll vi, (iriunell has
a reputation flint she never stops
fighting. Captain “Sonny" Davis our
bodies this spirit. His work both
captain and left tackle has been a
shining light in this season's football

Ross hruhn: Grinncll fans rcmcur
ber Itoss Evallll's work of last season
when he lrept opposing teams wonder-
ing whether he planned to make a
thrust through the line, try an end
run, or throw a long pass. Tl s year
he has added puuting to his other
threats. Mitch of the Pioneer success
in her passing attack rests with
Evahn,

Ray ('lelan Wherever lighting is
thickest, wherever players are piled
highest, there Cleland is using all of
his two-hundred pounds to hold down
his guard position and do a little more
too. ;

Charles Fai One or the first prob-
lems coach Watt faced in building his
team was to find two capable ends
The first man his eyes fell on was Red
Fail, Red started playing left end the
first night of practice and he's hecn
playing it ever since. He is somewhat
handicapped today by a game ankle
contracted at Lincoln last Saturday.

l-‘ntuttr Braille No team‘can play
football without a reliable center,
Much of the Pioneer oflense depends
on the steady passes of Bradley. Brads
ler, however, does not confine his abi .
ity to offensive play. He is big enough
to take his place in the line to stop
the opposing team's line play, yet agile
enough to step out of the line to bring
down passes.

Edwin Lietltkc: Sometimes an extra
yard is needed, once in a while some»
one must shoot out to catch a short
pass. then perhaps an end is troubling
and must be taken out of the play. In
any case the man to call on is Etl
Liedtlte. Ed isn't particularly large
but he is a hard driver. He plays
well at either half or fullback,

Iltu‘oltl ltnse: Last season there was
one man of the freshman squad who
was considered allrvzllley material.
That man was Harold hose. Rosie
hasn’f disappointed his most rabid dds
mirers. He hits the line hard, he rtins
well behind wide interference and he
throws a long pass now and then.

Paul ltliucl'clter: There is a big gap
in the right side of the line this are
ternoon resulting from Klinefelter's
forced vacation. Kline sprained his

. ankle Tuesday night in a scrimmage
with the freshmen. If he were play—
ing today, you would see a rather
large man doing his share of the play-
ing in the right tackle berth.

Charles Briggs: Briggs first gained
the attention of Coach Watt through
his ability to snag passes. Closer in-
vestigation showed that he had the
other requisites of a good end. The re-
sult—he is the varsity right end.

Meredith Heldrillgc: A little smaller
than Bradley, just as sure in passing

 

the hull llzlclt, rust about - hard a
plate Rod Holllri _ his first
varsity football game today. The :le
scucc ol Klincleltci- lctt \\’tttt a prob-
lem He decided his best substitute
lineman was Heidi-loge, he moved
ll-adley to tackle and injected Holdv
go in at eentc

Ii ut‘st )Ielntirte: 0n the shoulders
oi littlc Mae falls the task of running
the team. Just what to play and
where to play it riiust be decided by
him. Besides being a field general,
McIntii-c can kick, pass, or rim with
true varsity ab .,

Charles I‘hrisll: otf taclrlo plays are
the ones which gain the most ground.
If the center can be pulled out much
of the threat of these plays is gone
But to take the center from the middle
of the line leaves a vacancy which can
be filled only by two liiis guards.
Thus reasoned coach “You. The cen-
ter is of the roving variety now and
Parish is one of the two guards.

lluicht nrookr: Nu team is strong—
er than its substitutes and if all the
second string men were of the Brooke
varieti- Grinnell would be a near
valley champion. Brooke pla‘ys eith-
er guard or tackle with more than
average ability.

ltusst-ll Kiugcry: Ollly his lack of
size keeps Kingerv from the first
elcvcn’ He is fast. a good hall toter
ond a fair passer He hits hard for a
small man.

John Gibson Brawl: Sometimcs an
end fails to solve a formation, Then
the coach iinist solve it for him by
sending in another man. The man
Gl'llmell always turns to in such an
instace i Bl'owll, an end who will be
a varsity man w h more experience)

Howard )1 Whenever Coach
Watt sends in a substitute back his
first choice is “Hobbs" Macy. Hobbs
is a flashy back who does ever; thing
one should do almost as well as the
best in y man. The lope with which
he covers the ground is a cro s be-
twech a greﬂloulld's and a rabbi

ltu ell G ay: Up until the last two
weeks, Russ Gray has been bothered

~ h a bad ankle. Now he is fast
rounding into shape and promises to
be a factor in this Mtel‘noon's and in
later games.

Kenneth Pierce: Things weren’t gee
ing well toward the middle of the
third quarter out at Lincoln. Pierce
was injected as an after thought and
he made good. His little 135 pounds
tore off five or six yards for as many
downs. Fans may see something of
him this atternoo
