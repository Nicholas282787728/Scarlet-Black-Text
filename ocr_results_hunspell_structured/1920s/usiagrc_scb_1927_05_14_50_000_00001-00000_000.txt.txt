No Funds May
Disband Band

rrcscnt Debt mid Lock of Support
Mui- Causc hand Dissolution.

ft is probable that Griullell will be
without a hand next year, according
to Jack Cannaway, business manager
and Edwin Merrill, president.

According to Cannaway, the band
is at present in debt for equipment
purchased this year to the amount of
5140. Each hand member has been as».
sessed five dollars personally to help
raise the debt, but till) still remains
unpaid. Present plans include una—
thcr drive for funds within the baud
itself.

The Gl'illucll hand receives but $75
from the Pioneer chest and about $200
from scrucstcr fees. This has not
been adequate for purchasing music
and new uniforms, said Edwin Mer-
rill.

"Unless there is a drivc of some
kind among alumni, faculty and slu—
tlents. there will be no band to play
in Grinnsll college next year. We
can’t hope to keep fellows into an
in band work when they have nothing
to look forward to but practices. If
we had the ﬂuids and a little sup-
port we could put out a real collegv
band," Jack Cannaway asserted.

‘Prepping’ Scored
By H. J. Thornton

Tells Seniors at Chapel It Is
Below Conduct Standard
of College Men,

‘lColleg-e is all a grand adventure.
There is El. glow of satisfaction :hat
accompanies learning, and linking
friends, both with students Eula facul-
ty in the {our brief years of school,”
said H. J. Thornton. instructor in his.
tory, opening his talk to the s . ms
at Herrick chapel yesterday. .

“This is my Class. I came With it
and will leave with it. And I know
we leave with new friendships, new
associations, not alone with class-
mates but with the faculty of Crlnn‘ 1
college.

"Where could We better have ro-
malice than in college? It seems to
me there is no better environment for
romance and fellowship than on [hA
college campus. But there have been
shadows over these years. Many Whom
we loved. are gone and we regret it

Traditions Changed

Mr. Thornton noted the changing of
traditions in Grinnell in. the last four
years. He said, "Traditions are the
foundation of college life. To lose
some of them is irreparable; to lose
some of them cnnstitutes progress.
The passing a: the pajama parade, the,
toning down 6 “prepping" activities
in the litst few years ‘s a. matter for
congratulation. Grinnell will be it fi-
ller schuul when prepping is entirely
abolished. It is my opinion that paid-
dles, and red caps, the symbols Df hu-
miliation, are far below the standard

of conduct which college men set for
themselves,

Chapel Invaluable

“Our experiences in Chapel, listen-
ing to great lectures and to great art-
ists, hale been invaluable. It is what
keeps Gi-inuell going, that privilege
of having great citizens among us,

“And now for the future. I have no
advice but I do have a hope, and it is
only a hope. It is that we may take
with us into the world the spirit of
toleration, the sin t of kindness and
respect toward others.

”Above all, let us take with us the
spirit of healing-71m in the world tar
day there is an open sore that is con»
tinually kept open by international
disputes, A united spirit of heuling
is the nearest road to peace and the
spirit of fellowship."

PARTIES TODAY.

Three cottages will hold formal
house parties this weck end. Cottage
Five will use the Country club for
their “Good Luck" party, and Lloyd
Wells of Waterloo will furnish the
music. Cottage Three will entertain
at the Rand gymnasium at a studio
party with music by the Tempe Tcu-
scrs. Central will use the Central cor-
ridor and convert the root garden in-

Circus People Quite Human,

Interviewer Finds Thursday

By Joseph McKee

“Tllc show is not the show

But they that go.

Mcuagar-le to me

My neighbor be."

iEmily Dickinson.

The circus has come and gone. The
minaturc city sprung up and was torn
down within a [ew hours. People
rested and did tbcir bit toward the
show and went on, following he tan-
bark trail where ever it may lead. To
the early r,er the circus 'folk seem
just people, they are about their tents
washing, sewing, reading writing or
the thousand and one things necessary
for the preservation of comfortable
living.

The walk to the grounds was along
onc.‘ The caliope was sitting near the
toad belching a huge column of smoke
from its funnel. Teams were moving
wagons, elephants were pushing vans,
men were cursing and shouting and
no ring, and the mamgcrs were sit-
ting in canvas chairs supervising the
work.

A circus performer without his
paint and costume is just a plain per-
son and to the person who wanders
into the mystical land back of the “big
top” they are truly human.

Talks to Dog Trainer

The first per-son I asked about cir
cus life was a. woman whom I judged
to be Mrs. Smith of the Smith, Dog,
Monkeys and Ponies act. She was

, dipping some of the poodles in
a strong smelling dip to kill the licc
to which she said they were most sus-
ceptible of her dogs. Accompanied by
the barking of a pen full of Russian
Wolf hounds, Bulldogs, Collies, Span-
icls and several nondescript breeds
she told me about her eighteen years
experience traveling with this
bany.

VGood Marks Made
, ln Freshman Meet

Taylor Shows Up Well In Hurdles;
Kennedy Sets Fast Pace
1n Century.

Although considerably harassed by
bad weather. coach Duke assembled
his frosb track men and ran them
through their paces for the Missouri
valley freshman telegraphic meet.
Some good marks were made in the
events that were run, and several
more are expected to be set on Mona
day when the meet is completed,

Taylor, frosb hurdling sensation,
stepped over the low barriers in :25
seconds in his trials, and showed
plenty of reserve in his finish, In the
high stick events he ran the flight
in :15.ll, a nice mark considering the
fact that he ran without competition.

in the 100- -yard dasb Kennedy was
clocked in :,'>10 o, and Taylor in :10.4
seconds. These marks would have
been lower if the track had been firm-
er.

Taylor is expected to make a nice
mark in the div and 220 races which
he will run on Monday, and perhaps
will lcap far enough in the broad
lamp to place in that event also.

Prof, J. D. Stoops will speak on
“The Nature Religious" at the Bop-
tist Parsonage Sunday morning at ton
o'clock. All students are invited to
attend the discussion group.

 

 

Sorority Coeds a
Seek Both Men and Education

It the wearing of fraternity pins is
any indication, at least one-s 1.11 of
the sorority co-eds at ohio state came
to college to get a man as well as
an education.

A survey of the Lantern reveals the
fact that of bio members of the 17
leading social sororities, 114 are en-
gaged and 5 are married. The as
sumption is made that wearing a fro-
ternlty pin takes a girl out of “the
free, single and disengaged" class.

Only 12 of the 114 co-eds wear‘ dia~
mond rings. The rest flash fraternity
jewelry. In fact, one member of Alpha
Chi Omega flashes three fraternity
pins, but not all at the same time.

Wolf, pitching for the champs, was

Meet Ames Cinder Squad In Dual
There This Afternoon As
Saturday Feature,

PIONEERS DOPED TO LOSE

Expect Conger, Crack Distance.
Star, to Set New Record
In Half-Mile,

Conch Lester Duke and twenty~
Lill‘ce Pioneer track men left this
morning fur Aines where they will
meet the Cyclone Cinder team in a
dual incct this afternoon. The meet
will be the leading attraction at the
annual Vcisba week celebration.

Tile Pioneers, according to the dope
Dulll’ lied in tile SCARLET AND
BLACK on Wednesday, are doped to
come out of the meet second best.
This is no slam to the Grinnell team,
us they will be meeting one of the best
cinder and field aggregations in the
middle west. Captain Ray Conger,
Amos distance ace, is perhaps the
leading distance runner in the coun-
try, and will lead his men in two
events, the half-mile and mile runs.
In addition he will meet Alva Martin,
a former Northwestern star, in a spec—
ial loooryard race as a feature of the
contests, A new Valley mark is axe
Dected to be set in the hallrmile run
in this race, and a new record in the
longer distance may also be looked
‘lor.

Rinef‘nrt Sllnulil Will.

Captain "Mono" Rincfort, of the
Ci-innellians, will be at home in his
favorite events, the discus and shot,
and should win both in handy fashion.
Eincfort has been getting back into
his best form after a slight let-down
of the last few weeks, and will fore~
cast his chances for wins in the Valley
meet next week by his performances
today.

Don Laird, lengthy javelin thrower,
will make a strong attempt to ring up
a new record in the spear throwing
event, and stand a chance of doing so.
His best mark this season was made
last Saturday against the Teachers
team, when he hllrled the shaft 185
feet. The Cyclones boast a star in
Fry, who threw the javelin 172 feet to
win lrom Drake last week,

Strong Competition in Hurdles

The hurdles should provide some
snappy competi 'on with Witmer,
Ames timber star, running against
Long and Davis, Cr‘innell entries.
Long has been stepping over the high
sticks in the neighborhood of :16 sec—
onds, and Davis turned in a mark or
:25.4 in the lows, running against
Taylor in his freshman trials. These
marks are both high enough to place
well in fast competition, and both men
can he looked to for points in the
barrier races, -

Ames should win the distance
events handily. Whitley. Grinnell -
two-iniier has been out of practice all
week with a badly infected foot. but
w ll probably be entered in his fav—
orile race. ~ Gould may strike his
stride in the mile this week, and force
the Aggie boys to extend themselves
to win. .

)[rlibc Expected to l’liwe

McKee is counted upon to do well in
the ill] against Caulum, Cyclone mid-
dlc distance star, and a mark in the
neighborhood of :50 will no doubt be
rung up. The Crinncll boy is also
expected to sholl',well in the furlong.

Meeter will compote in the shot and
discus, and from all indications should
place second to his leader, kincfort in
both. "Butch" has been rather low in
the shot cvcnt this spring, but indies»
tions were made in the dual meet last
week that he‘ was rounding into shape.

Grim-tell will be especially weak In
the pole vault, and distance events, but
McCully in the high jump, and Beck
and Legore in the sprints are expect—
ed to count points for the Pioneers.

Lantern To Have Bouquet

The Lantern will hold a formal hem-
quet in the recreation room at the
Quadrangle Wednesday evening from
six to eight. About ﬁfteen couples
will attend and the dinner will be
chnperoned by members of the facul—
ty. The Cardinals will play, but the

 

remainder DI the program has not yet
been announced.
