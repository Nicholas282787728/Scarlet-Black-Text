Philip Manuel, the lyric tenor who
will sing is not only 1|. vocalist or OX7

never gives his accou‘lpanist any song
to play until he himself has thorough-
1y learned and memol ed tllc ac-
conopanllncnt. This serves to famil-
iarize every phase of the composition
to the singer.

Mr, Manuel's experiences abroad
have made him want to sing in his
own tongue to his own people. A17
though his knowledge of the romantic
languages is not slight, due to his
study in Vienna, Paris and London,
Mr. Manuel sings all or his texts in
English. If a given foreign song has
an English setting that is unpoetlc,
unfaithful to the original words or
one that does not “sing" well, IILr.
Manuel will recast into English only
alter he has acquired absolute (1111-111-

accompanist we have another young
American who has already become
