A news ittuir in this issue carries
the ilrtoiinauon that a training table
for lrlicl; men has been started at the
dominion

dining room.‘ Those who

know anything about the demands

which are made on the strength and

stainnra ot a runner know that rigid

training is absolutely necessary to
success on llJc cinder-s. The milcr who
has eaten too much or pal-taken oi the
wrong kinds of food, who has smoked
too much or who has cut down his
hours or sleep below the proper minis
mum is very likely to end his race
nearer the quarter—mile post than the
ﬁnish line. ‘

Every college student is‘ undergoing
demands tlpon his physical being of a
strenuous and continuous nature

It is hard to realize the stress and
strain or college life while one is a
part or it. That is why the danger
or overdoing is so great. Many stu—
dents have tried to keep up with the
pace until a nervous breakdown lett
them in bed to learn the moral or
proper training.

The wind that debaters have need
oi is not popularly supposed to he the
kind that can be materially helped by
a training table. And yet a dcbatcr is
toiced to undergo a

Friday evening Grinnell meets
Carleton in debate here This is the
ﬁrst debate or the season and is one
or the two debates which will be staged
on the home plattoi-m.

There are valid reasons why every
Grinnell student should be present
Friday evening. One is that the men
who will represent Grinneli have been
putting in long hours and strenuous
effort and that theretore they deserve
the interest or the student body.

No one who has not experienced the
grind of preparing tor a debate can
appreciate the long, laborious search
after all available material, the painsA
taking organization of the hriet and
speech, involving numberless revisions
or the nervous tension or the last
minutes preceding the opening speech.

But those who would not attend the
debate for the sake oi the debaters
might be more affected by the argu-

ment that the honor of Grinnell is at'
stake and that a full attendance on the ‘

part of the student body will furnish

the support which is necessary to vlc—‘

toryi
There is also a purely Selﬁsh reason

for attendance, The question under

discussion deals with the problem ot'one in the solution oi which education
