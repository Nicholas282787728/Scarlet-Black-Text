Automatic Telegraph Receivers
Permit Faster Sending of Press

"No said Paul Lincoln, operator
or the locztl Postal telegraph Office,
"you can send more than 20,000
words an hour over one wire at one
time. The telephone companies have
learned how to send iori. messages
atonco orer one conductor, but their
total volume or cor spondence is no
greater than ours with tour or the
new machines sending at once.”

The old click-click method has its
limitations, Mr. Lincoln pointed out.
A good telegrapher can send at almost
any speed, and the receiver can write
down the letters as inst as he hears
them. But there is a speed beyond
which the human car will no longer
catch the sounds,

,iuttimutic‘ Receiver [and

"The mux apparatus has solved the
problem by eliminating the human
element. A machine like a typewriter
is placed at one end or the wire ,nnd
when a letter is punched, a receiver
automatically print: it a thousand
miles away.

"It has long been known how to send
roiir messages over one wire at the
same time. By putting the new ma-
chine on the old device, tour machlu»
es, each sending at maximum rate,
may deliver twenty thousand words
an hour on a single line. This was
actually accomplished at the Denier
cratic National convention, where
that many words were necessary to
keep pace with the arguments on the
floor.

Press Sorl‘it‘eb ['s'r Postal].

"The Grinnell ofiice is used by three
press associations, the International
News Service, the United Press. and
the Associated Press, and three metros
politan newspapers, the Des Moines
Register and Tribune, the Chicago
Tribune, and the Chicago HeraldrEx-
aminer, but there are no permanent.-
ly leased lines. However the two Chi-
magi) concerns and the Register and
1'l‘ribulie sometimes lease a Wile for
a few hours, connected directly from
Ward Field to the news office, for
Abs most important. lootballl games."

Comparatively few messages iroin
abroad go through Mr. Lincoln’s
hands. although greetings ironi Eti-
rope are common around Christmas
time, and several messages assuring
relatives of their satety wee sent to
Grinnellians from the Phillipine
Islands after the hurricane last
spring. There is a hook or letter com-
binations which mean whole sentences
which patrons may use in preparing
cablegrsms, because of the high rates.
The Morse code is used, although
each station has its own code word
tor translating the messoges into ole
‘pher.
