“PHE’PPlNG” AND
BBlNNELL IDEALS
ﬂﬂNFLlﬂlj-MAIN

An Appeal To Abolish “Prep-
ping," Not An Order, Was
Issued Says Prexy.

EQUALITY FDR FRESHMEN

Matter Both Student And College
Affair; Called Outrage By
, Many Parents, Alumni.

,, "1 have nei‘el' issued an order to
Grinnell college I did not l one an
. order to the men in my letter to the
house chairman concerning prop
hing.” declared President J. H. T.
hiain in his ellapcl address yesterday
morning. He spoke on the relation of
prepping to the ideals o1 Grinncll.
"Hanover, I did make appeal to the
lllcn,~an appeal to have done witll
the disreputable thing called ‘91P
pillg. it came out of my heart on the
conviction tllnt the men were ready
to date the thing as ‘llot done in Grim
ne11."‘
in speaking about the criticism
which the action received because at
a seeming conillct with student gov-
crnment, he said, “Is prepping entire—
ly a student matter? In a large and
Hill] way, it is an institutional ﬂour
cern. Grinnell hzls'beell disgraced by
it many times, Prepping has been
called an outrage against Grillllcll
college, the students, and the parents
who send their soils to school here.
"it is the concern or ever y boy who
linlnks oi college oi parents sending
sons to college, and oi anyone uplo
has' any care at rl-cshmcn coming ior
the iirst time into the communlty liic
oi college. it is in some phases a sill
against personality, the most sacred.
possesSion anyone has."
Freshman Rights.
“Prepping , lll direct conflict with
our convictiongand with the ideals
oi the college, Freshmen has as much
right to the heuetits oi college as the
uppcnclassmen. ’
0i Grinnell ideals, the president
said, "The administration wishes to
reach tor use on tho campus the prin-
ciples governing life. The Crinnell
campus is the world campus in lulnlas
ture. Grinnell truth, justice. and mu-
tual obligations are all oi the world
campus. Lite here depends on the
students, on their mutual sensibility

and good rule, and on their respect~_

oi individual rights.
‘ Lantern Takes Action.

President Main brietly mentioned
a petition that hadbcen given to him
by a committee irom Lantern. This
petition asked tor a. specitic interpre~
.tation oi the term "prepping" in ad-
dition to labelling,the previously un-
derstood “order” as inconsistent with
the prevailng iorms oi student gov-
ernment. The committee from Lantern
consisted oi Harris Coggeshall, chair-
man, Harold Colbert, and Laurence
Lunden. it was felt by members oi
Lantern that the petition tor reconr
sideration and not tully dcalt with.

Tile present situation g’rows out oi
a letter written by President hiain to
each house chairman and delivered
on December 7, .This letter asked the
men to renounce prepping tor all time
on the.Grinncll campus. ‘A meeting
at the council oi house chairmen was
called to discuss the matter with
Dean Findlay. This body saw tit to
regard the letter as an order, voted
to accept it as such without consider
ing the question as a matter oi lc
‘lation, and- passed it on to the men
or the college.

It is thought that some action. vill
take place by the council or house
chairmen in light oi the President's
talk at chapel.

Game With Coe Monday Night To Mark
Renewal 0f Relations With Old Rivals

The CoerGrliluell game iionu ‘
not merely a basketball game, but
its more iluDoi‘tunL feature is the
fact that it marks {I step in atlllutlc
relations of the two colleges, all im-
pullout stel), for it is the l‘esulllbr
lion of relations llrolieu off in
1924:

it was lelt in 1924 that Cor,

all unfair advantage ovei‘ ,tlle
Pioneer teams in that they Were

standards which It was felt (lid not
measure up to the standards or the
Missouri Valley conference of which
Gl‘iuuell was at that time it memo
hcr. ,

The bitter-est rivalry had existed
between the schools for Several

. in previous to the break and tho
odds seem to have boon mostly with
Coc judging by the game scores,
in 1913 Coe won a in to x \I
tol-y lrom ‘Lllc Pioneers and ill
1921 the score was 10 t9 0 in
Invor oi Coe. Tile Cyclone lor the
1922 season ior some reason does
not give the score oi the game, but
it says that ”the Pioneers were’ not
able to get their attack working

of the score.

The CoasGl'll‘mEll game to he pla

which it is hoped will provc benefls
