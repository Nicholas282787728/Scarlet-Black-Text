EXAMS POSTPONED,

There can be little doubt that faculty action taken
Monday evening to postpone mid-semester examinations
from Thursday and Friday of this week to the Tuesday
and Wednesday preceding Thanksgiving, has met“ with
general student approval. And now that the text
books have been laid away upon the shelves to collect
another week's dust and undergraduate sighs at the un-
expected reprieve bave subsided, students are beginning
to rationalize the situation. ’

The“ postponement would seem sensible in that
it lengthened the interval between monthly quizzes. the
horrors of which are still fresh on student's minds, and
the midrsemester examinations. The lengthening of this
interval naturally means a chance to recuperate and an
opportunity for better preparation of the midterm
exams. Had the examinations been given this week
instead of next, class work at Crinnell would have had
to be defined as simply a "breathing space between
quizzes."

Another valuable feature of the postponement is
that it sets the examination for a date which fixes a
more natural line of demarcation between the first
phase and second phase of the semester's work. The
mid-semester exams conclude the first half of the term'a
study and to stress this conclusion a pause is necessary.

The Thankgivrng vacation is the pause or period which
properly sets off the introductory from the concluding
section of the terms activity.

Since Crinnell has always sets its important exam»
inations right before a vacation as witness the final
examinations of 'both first and second semesters, and
the Christmas and Easter alumina/lions during the year,
it would seem logical as far as possible to Set. all
exams occuring throughout the school season at psy-
chologically appropriate times such as these. The post-
ponement of the mid-semesters, therefore, by keeping in
line with the general school examination policy is to be
commended.

A CULTURAL EDUCATION.

The stressing of the value of a cultural education
by Harvey lngha’m in his speech Friday night especial-
ly interested and encouraged Grinnell students. Far

too often are we apt to think that the college educa—
tion which institutions like Grinnell offer equip its
graduates for nothing and represents four- wasted
years. A statement from a man with the experience
and knowledge of Mr. Ingham cannot be ignored and
may be taken as representing the viewpoint of many
conservative thinking men who have constant contact
with college graduates. It throws additional light on
this subject which is essentially controversial in. chain
actero

The stories often told of college students going to
work after graduation for the people with whom they
graduated from high school or having to take a busir
ness course. to get a job, tend to depreciate a student's
sense of the value of his college education, To overs :
come the effects of these stories requires frequent Con—
tact with such men as Harvey Ingham and frequent
study of articles which tell of the number of college
graduates succeeding as compared with the num—
ber of men and women who do not have this additional
education. only then can the liberal arts student
realize that this sense of bewilderment so common to -
college seniors and the flounderings of the
college graduate are generally but a temporary condi-
tion.

‘ Campus Opinion '

Ques on Do you favor not bsv
ing vacation on the Friday after
Thanksgiving?

Pauline Bleakney: I believe stu-
dents should have vacation on the
Friday after Thanksgiving because
[many students want to go home and
cannot; this is unfair to them. 'Some
'students live too far away. but a
good many are invited to go home
with friends Thanksgivin means as
much to some students' as does
Christmas. After a nice big turkey
dinner, students can work much

, harder. Let’s have Friday off next
year. ‘ ' “WIN

Hugh Edwards:Surely.I favor not
having vacation on the Friday after
Thanksgiving because now we have
a longer Christmas recess. I'd trade

of the longer Christmas vacation
conning so soon after.

Sue Rockafellow: ‘I'd just as semi
have classes the Friday after Thanks-
giving because I can’t go home any»
way.

Russell Smith: No,‘if it is a matter
of lengthening the Christmas vaca-
tion, my opinion is that the vacation
at that, time this year is too long.
Why not spread it out a little?

Jean Williams: I prefer to have a
longer Christmas vacation and only
the one day at Thanksgiving. For
those who do not live near Grilmeu
it is an advantage.

There will be a mixed swimming
period conducted by the Physical
Education department at two o’clock
Friday afternoon. All men and
women of The college will b2 given
the use of the pool at this time. If
the plan is successfuluthere will be
