Collins Speaks on ,
World-Peacevat Y

“when men individually decide that
war is wrong, and refuse to fight, then
war’ will cease," declared George L.
CDllins, field secreml'y at the Fellow-
ship of Reconciliation, in Y meeting
Thursday night Mr. Collins then
went on to show that slavery and
prohibition had not heenstopped by
a. majority, but by an active minul'ity
that grew into a majority. “Wal‘ is
incompatible with Christianity be—

hood, love, or even oo-operation," said
the speaker.

The question which Mr.
Collins left in the minds of his hearers
is summed up in one statement “May-
be the destiny or e world is not in
the hands oi the college man, but
the college man can have '9. part in
it it he wills to do so—it is up to
you."

Meaning of Prayer.

In keeping with the observance oi
the international week at prayer, the
second oi the student meetings of the
Y. W, C. A. held Thursday evening had
"Prayer" as its subject, Hilda Mauck
was the leader. ,

“We hear much public prayer and
ditch pray periunctcrlly for our—
selves”, said Miss Mauck, “but it is
seldom that prayer reaches the heights
or its potential greatness". She read
as examples at great prayer, several
prayers at st. Augustine, St, Thomas
and Christina Rossetti. r

Mary Williamson spoke on the
prayers oi Robert Louis Stevenson.
Most ct his prayers were written dur-

 

i'ng the last years of his life, spent in
Samoa. Stevenson lelt prayer a ne~
cesslty.

Harry Emerson Fosdlck’s concep—
tion of prayer was explained by El-
fl‘iede Cal-tuna. “Prayer is Conversa-
ticm with God", says Fosdick. "It is
encouraged, not discouraged by the
uniailing laws of nature",

Lorene Davis song “The Lord is my
Shepherd". ‘
