Two Profs. Attend
Psychology Meet

The two outstanding papers read
at the Ninth International Congress
on Psychology, according to Prof.
J. D. Stoops and Mr. L. C. Douglass
of the Psychology department, were
those of Dr. Lashley, the University
of Chicago, and of William McDoug-
all. This congress. attended by
psychologists from all over the world,
was held at Yale University at New
Haven, Connecticut. August 31 to
Sept. 6, the first time that this con-
gress has been held in America.

Professor Lashley, in his paper,
summed up the experimental results
of his work for many years, attack-
ing the theory of the localization of

.~brain functions.
Cnttell Represents Columbia

That there is a school of psychol-
ogy which wants to make psychology
an exact science, with everything
built on measurement and one that is
objective, was the theory upheld by
Cattell, professor at Columbia uni—
versity. McDougall represented the
opposite school, arousing much con-
troversy upon the subject, as his
theory on inheritance of behavior
was attacked severely.

“There seemed to be a rather un-
animous opposition to the reflex
theory of behavior. However, Prof,
l. P. Pavlov, the venerable scientist
from Russia, the founder of the re
ﬂex theory, received an overwhelm.
ing ovation from his audience when
he read his paper," professor Stoops
stated.

“Another outstanding paper,"
Stoops declared. “was that read by
Coghill of Wostar Institute. He
claims that his experiments show
‘that the responses of the whole or-
ganism come first, and that the re-
flex behavior is a derived form of be-
havior.“

Margaret Welshaar, 9, now a
post-graduate student at Iowa uni-
versity, was in Grinnell Saturday af-
ternoon.

GRINNELL, IOWA,

Scribes Dope
Grinnell to Win

Gridders Meet Perm First
in Local Schedule;
Point for Ames.

Year after year sports writers of
the nation have been called upon to
use that somewhat hackneyed
phrase. “Grinnell is doped to lose—
but the Pioneers have a tradition for
which they fight to the last." This
season, if advance indications are
borne out they may say that “Grinnell
is given an even chancegand has a
traditional fighting spirit that may
bring victory."

When Captain Harold Rose leads
his scarlet-clad warriors to the grid-
iron against the Penn Quakers Sets
urdny, there may be lettennen on the
bench. There may be men in the
lineup who have never seen action in
a college game before. Whoever
starts, and as yet Coach watt has
kept that a dark secret, it will be
the combination which has, in the
opinion of the mentor. proven the
most powerful in practice.

Trick Plays Impressive

The scrimmage against Central
Tuesday showed the few fans in the
stadium just what power the Flo.
neers have this year. Although
Coaches Watt and Duke shifted the
team continually. new men running
in and out at every position, passes
worked nicely. gains were counted
off tackle, long end runs were seen.
Best of all there were trick plays
that should help_to keep possession
of the ball when there are still eight
yards to go at the third down, The
Dutchmen from Fella, under the dir-
ection of Coach Len Winters. didn't
have a chance during the scrimmage.
With the ball on the ten yard line
they smacked the Grinnell forward
wall time and again, only to be held
to a margin of inches.

Thomas, speedy understudy to
Ernie McIntire, broke away twice, a
pass to Minier put him in the open
for a trot to the goal and there were
many other times when long gains
were reeled off against the lowa
conference squad.

Watt Drives Men

Coach Watt has his passing attack
of 1923 very much in evidence, but
lacking its sensationalism. Whereas
a minor running offensive forced
the team last season to depend upon
the air for a gal , the practice of
tossing the pig-skin will this year
serve to augment a stellar ser-
ies of plays and driving smashes.

The mentor is not boasting. He
isn’t even satisfied, He drives his
men continually toward greater per-
fection. He is out to better his last
year's record. Drake is doped to
take the conference title this season
and the Pioneers scheduled for third.
The dope has been spilled all over the
playing field before, however, and
there will be 11 men on the field in
every game this season trying to do
just that thing.

Edward Tyler, manager of the
Malteaser, called a meeting of try—
outers for the business staff in the
A. R. H. Monday afternoon. Twenty
reported.

The Watch, theNl'ght, the Bloody Fight
Are Tests for Pen and Observer’ 3 Ken

BY THE CASUAL OBSERVER

NIGHT—TEE VIGIL

The shades of night are over all;
the sun has taught his golden bed;
nocturnal birds now hunt and call,
and day's last light is long since sped.
New rules the heavens left and right,
that awesome mystery of might. the
sabled ghostliness of night, a shroud
o'er all the earth outspread. Now
lurks the dark. Cimmerian gloom;
tenebrous shadows fill the sky; the
black~robed messengers of doom flap
inky wings and hover night, The
tranquil world is sunk in sleep, re-
posing in quiescence deep; it snoozes
on without a peep. except where
sleepless sophs outcry. The night is
rent by hideous sounds, by plaintive
cries and iurtive yells; somnolent
sophomores roam the grounds, while
freshmen search adjoining dells. And
thus, while normal persons sleep, the
frosh and soph their vigil keep. until
at last they homeward creep, and
leave their individual hells.

 

 

DAWN—Tim ARENA

The sun climbs up the eastern rim
and winks his early morning eye; his
humor squelches shadows grim and
glorious sunshine fills the sky. The
upperclassmen arouse from dreams;
the morn is filled with warming
beams commingled with some awful
screams, and to the scene they hie.

The battle rages loud and sweet,
and yells ascend as foe meets foe;
each sophomore tries to keep his
feet; each frosh to tie him thumb
and toe. The freshmen smite them
hip and thigh, till many brave ones
silent lie, but still the fight will end
a tie, because the rule has stated so.
The shades of Roman tyrants come
to watch the bloody holocaust, and
Nero mutters, “0 how dumb—How
much enjoyment l have lost. I
thought, when I was here below, that
I could stage a bloody show; but 1107
the best that I could throw, compar—
ed to this. was just a frost."

Collegians Will
Take Leads in
Local Elks’ Play

The Elks lodge room has been a
busy place for the past few days
while principals and chorus of the
Elks musical play, "Good Luck,” to
be given at the Colonial Thee‘tre next
Thursday and Friday evenings, pro-
gressed steadily in their parts under
the skillful direction of Miss Acquin
Kilcoin of the Metropolitan Pro-
ducing Company.

There is every indication that in
spite of the short notice on which
the play is being staged a well raund<
ed and successful performance will
be given. The cast of principals has
been selected with care and includes
a number of actors well knovm in
Crinnell amateur theatricals. The
singers can sing and the actors can
act and the choruses include a bevy
of Grinnell's fairest daughters.

The play itself is also meeting the
approval of those who are becoming
familiar with it. There is enough
plot to hold it together, there is plen-
Ly of crisp. up to date comedy and
the musical numbers are said to be
very fetching. The play is staged at
nixby College and the plot is based
on the confusion of two identities,
one the new botany professor and the
other the new janitor, both of them
named Jones and both having the
same initials.

The professor, played by
Davis Green. and the janitor, by
Don Banta, have important roles
which are being well taken. The chief
soubrette part of Sally Benton, popu—
lar student. is played by Ruthe Cole,
whose vocal abilities are wellknown,
Mildred Sawyers plays the part of
Joyce Caldwell, Sally's roommate,

d Monday Night

Smoking Will be Restricted
to Rooms in Cottage IV,
V Basements.

Minutes I Graduated

Social Committee Will Include
Representatives From
Each Floor.

At a mass meeting Monday even-
ing in the little theater of the quad»
rangle, the women's league constitu-
tion, embodying revisions made by
this year's board. was read to the
girls by Fern Teget, the president,
The articles revised include changes
in the smoking rule, attendance at
dances off the campus, and accumula-
tion of minutes.

The new rule on smoking is based
on the results of a referendum taken
last spring, when all girls in the
quadrangle were given an opportunity
to express their feelings in relation to
smoking.

Smoking Not Encouraged.

Although by an overwhelming ma~
jorlty the girls signiﬁed that indivldlb
ally they did not want smoking in the
quadrangle, on the campus, in tea
rooms and other public places of Crin-
nell, there was a general prevalence
of opinion that smoking should be
permitted in certain speciﬁed places.
In response to this referendum the
rule which formerly allowed no stock-
ing during the college year, now
reads: “There shall be no smoking in
student rooms or living 'quarters of
the quadrangle, in any other college
buildings, or in public places "

“W‘ ile this rule does not encourage= ‘
smoking, it does when possible for"
girls who have learned to Smoke,"
Fern Teget, league board president,
stated yesterday. It was announced
that basement rooms in cottages IV
and v might be suitably equipped for
those who were interested. For the
time being it was left to the discre—
tion of the girls themselves to determ—
ine what was meant by "public
places." Heavy penalties were an-
nounced for those violating the rule.

Minute Rule Altered

Revision in the article concerning
attendance at dances off the campus
provides that no girl shall attend an
unchaperoned dance during the col-
lege year, and that permission to at-
tend any dance off the campus must
be obtained from the dean of women.
Formerly the rule read that no public
dance might be attended by a Grinnell
girl. The difficulty of determining
the exact character of some dances
made this change desirable. In cases
of doubt students will be expected to
obtain a suitable chaperon.

The accumulation of minutes which
will give a penalty has been changed
from a uniform maximum allowance
of forty-five minutes in lockouts, to a
varying number for different classes.
In the future all seniors are allowed
sixty minutes before being penalized,
juniors ﬁfty, sophomores forty, and
freshmen thirty.

Many Rules Unchanged,

other misdemeanors. besides ac-
cumulation of minutes. include as
usual illegal entrance into or from
the quadrangle, attendance at unauth-
orized dances, overrrunning of the
permitted number of majors and min-
ors, or any conduct reflecting to the
discredit of the college or individual.

All other rules have been little
changed. Hours continue the same,
with the speciﬁcation that girls at-
tending house parties will be allowed
11:45 hours, and all girls in the quad—
rangle will be given 11:45 hours on
the nights of the homecoming dance
and the junior prom. The quadrangle
will be open until twelve on the nights
of vacation formals.

More Organization to be Had.

The necessity for quiet hours was
stressed, and the existence of the per—
manent record was explained. More
than one misdemeanor a semester. or
any offense considered sufficiently
serious by the league board will be
placed on the permanent record for
the year, which is passed on to the
