Wilhelm Will Captain
1930 Basketball Team

Harold Wilhelm was named
by his team mates to gather
gray hairs or lmlrels over the
late of the 192930 Grinncli Col—
lege cage quintet at a meeting
Tuesday citeruoon. Although
the new captain did not win an
Honor G zlwrlrd last year he-
causc of a knee injury, he was
an outstanding member of the
1927428 squad.

Wilhelm is from Rock Island
where he gained a knowledge of
basketball which has served him
in good stead. His most recent
burst of basket-shooting was in
the sensational rally of the Pio-
neers against Drake last reb-
ruary while he was in the game.
Despite his game knee the new
captain was always in the thick
or the fight.

Lady Discusses
lnclia Problems

Missionary Pictures Hindu

Life at Vespers
Sunday.

Miss Lillian Pickch, who has for
twelve years been a missionary to In»
dia, spoke at the Congregationul
church Sunday morning and at the
regular college Vesper service in the
afternoon. she also talked in‘formnl-
ly in the guadrahgle drawing room
after dinner.

A description of the conditions in
India formed the basis of her morn-
ing message. After She described
some or its many beauties. she spoke
of the sordidness of Hindu life. Miss
Picken pictured the horrible suffel'r
ings of the child widow and pointed
out the fact that what India needs
most oi all is Christianity. It. is her
belief that the people of indie reel-
ly want Christianity and that they
w i be happier for it. Through ChrlSr
tianity they will be able to conquer
their fear of death which is respon-
sible for many of their superstitions
and social needs.

In lslkiug in the quadrangle draw-
ing room, l ss Pickell spoke of the
home rule problem, and it is her he-
lief that India is not yet ready for
such a step. She pointed out that
while unity is necessary for India's
advancement, the Hindu people seem
almost hopelessly disurlified. The
prevalence of Hindu-Moslern riots,
both in the cities and the villages
and the lack of a single language are,
the speaker believes. the greatest fac-
tors in the country's lack of solidar-
ity.

“The Quest for God" was the sub-
ject or Miss Pieken’s lecture given
during the Vesper hour. The speaker
stressed the fact that while in this
country the trend of life seems to be
toward the materialistic, in India the
people as a whole are in quest for
God. Perhaps the most vivid of Miss
Picken's descriptions was that of
Mahatma Ghztndi ltnd his influence
upon the Hindu people.

Society to Exhibit
Famous Woodcuts

Lithographs, woodcuts, and etchings
or Eirger Snndzen will be included
in the annual Cap chad Gown art
exhibit to be held in the Recreation

tor of the art school of Bethany col-
lege, Lindsborg, Kansas, is a lithOr
grapllel‘ of international reputation,
His lithograph, Greek at Moonrise,

centennial exposition in Philadelphia.

Called "different" by both conservae
tive and radicals Sandzeu Stands by
his own interpl‘etntiun at nature.
While his subjects include both Kan—
sail and southwestern country his art

accent.

Dr. Henry Goddard Leach, editor of
the Forum, Writing in the American
Scandinavian Review on the "Linds—
burg Idea" says: "At Lindsborg, lI’ro-
iessor Birger Sandzcn hits his studio.

Board Alters Campusing Rule
Study Hall to be Substituted;
Students to Vote on Dance Fee

Council Announces Ballot
to be Held Thursday
Evening.

Tomorrow evening a vote will be
taken in the dorms and cottages on a
referendum drawn up by the Student
council at its meeting Monday night.
If the vote is favorable, an additional
charge of three dollars will be added
to the semester fee, bringing the total
up to $10.50, which will take care
of all social functions for the year
excluding house parties.

It was felt by the student council
that the high cost of admission to
social functions made them prohibit-
ive to many. thus placing the burden
of expense upon a few, and that there
was a lack of cooperation in the af-
fairs. The council feels that the new
