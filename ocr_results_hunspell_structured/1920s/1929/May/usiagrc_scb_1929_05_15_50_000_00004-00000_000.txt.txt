.Ancient War Dances of American
Indians Resembled Classic Balle_t| On Other Hills

(Science Service)

New York. May 12 (Special): When
the American Indians danced to cele»
brete peace or war or to appear to
the rain gods in time of drought, they
used many dance steps very like the
classic ballet. This has been demon-
strated heiore the New York Acad~
emy of Science by two musicians who
have analyzed the dances of Indians
of the Southwest. ’

'l‘bese musicians are two sisters.
Bessie Evans and May G. Evans. of
the Peabody Conservatory of Music.

, While one descrihed the ind-an dance
technique. the other in complete In»
dian dress and war bonnet executed
the steps in true Indian tashion.

Much less attention has been paid
to the native American dances than to
the aboriginal songs. Miss Evans eXr
nlained. Nowhere could she find any
Taco-rd of» the dances written in a sys-
tematic fashion. so that the steps
could he duplicated. After observing
'the dances in Indian pueblos and
ceremonial rooms, and after taking

' lessons whenever Indians could be
persuaded to teach their art. the sis-
ters have worked out a system of no-
iation ior recording the steps

The Indian dancer knows the turn.
the leap. or as the French hallet term
has it, the jete. the hope. or saute. and
so on. But the lndian mariner ot per-
forming the steps is distinctive. One
of the steps in a dance or the Hopi
Indians is similar to a Negro clog
step. Another Indian dance suggests
an Irish jigedanced with hands on
hips and jigging feet. ‘It has been
said that southern negrnes borrow-
ed the cake-walk from a Seminole
procession of couples.

"The analogy must not he carried
too far, lest it be though we are
trying to trace the origin of the In
dian through his dances,” Miss Evans
stated. “Nor should the comparisons
call up the ridiculous picture of the
Indian in typical ballet costumes and
'Poses."

The Indian did. however. use define
it: technique. and special steps were
:arduously practised. she explained.
"the Indians dancing was usually a
spiritual ceremony. A flaw of emis-
:sion or commission might mean that
an imperfect offering was made to the
powers. and might cause them to be
offended instead of propitiated.
