Hollenbeck Expected to Take All
Grimlell Men in Distances;
Relay Team May Win.

With Warner Taylor ineligihle,
Coach G. L. Duke of the Pioneer track
squad has a dismal outlook for his
next dual meet against Creighton at
Omaha Saturday. Taylor has been the
central point of the squad and leads
in individual points by a big margin.
Duke has no dash man or hurdler to
take his place and his position in the
mile relay will be hard to fill.

Grinnell took the Carleton dual by
.a much larger margin than was ex-
pected and, with Taylor in, could eas-
ily win the Creighton meet. With him
out. the meet will be a battle from
start to finish. Grinnell can collnt
only a few places in the distances.
Hollenbeck, Creighton star, is capable
of handling any Missouri Valley com-
petition in great style, and, barring .
broken leg, he can win his races.

Fielll Events Dt-citlr" Meet

Grinnell will probably take one
place in the century and the 220
and a pair of places in the 440. The
hurdles will he rather evenly d idea
with Hensley stepping the barriers for
the Pioneers. With the distances go-
ing to Creighton, and the mile rec
lay to Grinnell, the outcome will very
likely depend upon the field events.
Although the Pioneers are weak there
as records go. they came through well
against Carleton and may repeat with
Omaha. '

Coach Duke will take 22 men on
the trip and has not yet announced
who will fill Taylor's place berth on
the relay unit. Peterson, Kelley. and
Macy are all good bets. however, anrl
will probably fight it out for the place
somclime this week.

Knox college is essentially Grin-
nell plus the fraternity system. Aside
from this rather significant differ-
ence the schools have much in coma
man, and, on the whole, a Grinnell
student feels pretty much at home on
the Knox campus. While hestitancy
would be the proper course in at-
tempting to evaluate Knox and her
fraternity system simply on- the basis
of the somewhat fliglrty observation

Having opened the regular tennis
season with a pair of victories over-
the Oklahoma Aggies and Notre
Dame. the Grinncll tennis team is this
week priming for its traditional rival
of other sports, Drake. The Bulldogs
are scheduled to appear here Satur-
day, led by one Frank Brody, who as
Des Moines reports would have it.

season pl'actie session, it two man air

have had a good many practice ses-

to their credit.

The match at Drake, sclrcdnlcd for
late in April, but postponed, will be
[played May 22. Both the match here
and the one there will be with four
man teams. Although the Bulldog af»

One can hardly say that conditions
at Knox ul'e decidedly unsatisfactory
or even perhaps as had as those zit
hundreds of other colleges that look
to the fraternity system for the or-
ganization of their men, Certain it
is. however, that thc political domir

features at Knox,

Tlle dining hall question, an im—

men, unless specifically excused by
the dean, are required to eat at the
college dining hall. student dissatis-

Knox Strident which characterized the
meat served as “horse meat,” result-
ed in a strike of the head cook.

Smile Drinking

This condition, ex sting of the time
of the writer's visit at Knox, makes
comparison with the Grinnell dining
hall difficult. However, if, as runny
seemed to think was the case. there
was no appreciable slump in the dual-
ify of the fare. then Grinnell men
have a good deal to be thankful for.

Student government does not ap-
pear to play a very vital part in Knox
life. Matters arising within the hous-
