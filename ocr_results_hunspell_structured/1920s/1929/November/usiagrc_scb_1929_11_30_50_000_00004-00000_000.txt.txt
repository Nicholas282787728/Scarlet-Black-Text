TO the Editor of the SCARLET AND
BLACK.

Dear Sir:

We Wish to make public apology
for the great wrong done posterity
by the mangling of three lines of
Nonsense verse appearing in a re-
cent Malteaser. _We realize that
though such errors might have been
excusable in any other section of the
magazine, their occurrence in this
particular section was an insult to
all those who appreciate art.

We should also like to comment on
a letter appearing in the “What Do
You Think" column on November 23,
charging ”temperamental typeset~
ters" and “dizzy proof~readers” with
the errors which appeared in the
Malteaser. We have never found our
typesetters temperamental, but on
the other hand, most accommodating.

We would also like to point out
that it might have been more effec-
tive for the writer to have complain-
ed to the management of the Mal-
teaser. In conclusion. we might say
that there is no contract binding any
particular genius to continue prac-
ticing his art in a publication set up
by I "temperamental typesetters",
checked by “dizzy proof readers" and
read by “a deluded portion of the
public.“

SincerelyTO‘urs,
Arthur de Persia.

remainder of this year‘s varsity and
the freshman squad will devolve a
big job to produce within two years

The members of the squad who
will return next year to play varsity
ball will be Thomas, Ruff, Walker,
Minier. Christoffersen, Tipton, Brad-
ford, Richey, Edman, Fuller. Pitcher
and Klemme. From the freshmen
will come Ullrich,’ Bowlby, Hamilton,
