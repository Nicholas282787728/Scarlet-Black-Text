At The Theaters E

In this column, it will be pos-
sible only to present to the read-
er a resume of the story. Only
in the case of very excellent pic-
tures will there be any additions
al comment. It will he Impos-
sible to give the pictures any
rating. For this, we recommend
the reviews in VANITY Fm,
THE NEW YDR'KER, and LI-
BERTV.

“Welcome Danger" with Harold
Lloyd, Barbara Kent; a Harold. Lloyd
production. Appearing at the
Strand theatre tonight. Sunday,
Monday, and Tuesday.

Harold Lloyd, after a year and a
half’s absence from the ‘screen, be-
oomes Hollywood's playrboy again in
his iirst all-talking comedy. “Wel-
come Danger". Because of his fath-
er's reputation, Harold is called to
San Francisco to'stnmp out crime in
underworld Chinatown. He does
this. All the speed and action of his
past successes are still present. The
action is never sacrificed for the
dialogue: thelsound is intelligently
recorded with clever, ori inal effects.
' "The Virginian" with Gary Cooper,

- Mary Brian, and Walter Huston: a
Paramount production. Appearing
at the Colonial theatre tonight, Sun»
day, Monday, and Tuesday.

Cooper, Grinnell's recent guest (in
case you haven’t heard about it yet),
also makes his talkie debut in “The|
Virginian". an adaptation of Owen
Wister‘s novel. Cooper saves the
Vermont schoolm‘am from a wild
steer in the true Western fashion,
thereby accomplishing a most in»
formal introduction. There are
plenty of dramatic moments which
are executed without the usual af-
fectedness. The director has given
careful attention to detail in his
portrayal of Wyoming in its infancy.
The exterior shots are ﬁlmed and re-
corded remarkably; likewise the

svoices are natural.

We believe that these two pictures
are worthy of your attendance. Both
are rated as excellent and our pre-
views substantiate this.

BLACK.

the ball sticking up peacefully from
a drift of snow, the Grinnell ‘Le'dm
went into a huddle and evidently hit
on the right play, as Rose smacked
through center for the second mark—
er of the game, the try for extra
point going wide.

Another Pioneer march down the
field followed, but a. costly fumble
gave the Bluejays the ball, From
then on, the tide of battle shifted.
and Creighton showed a respectable
offense, bringing the ball La the
twenty yard line as the game ended.

While little of important conse-
quence occurred in the first half,
Grinnell did stage one offensive drive
that threatened to score. After a
series of punts hadgiven Grinnell the
ball on about the Creighton forty
yard line, Rose, Liedtke and Douglas,
who contributed the most brilliant
performance of his college career to
date, alternated in carrying the ball
down the field on a series of Spinner
plays and end runs to the three yard
