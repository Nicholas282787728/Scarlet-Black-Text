Moon Is Prof ’s
Theme for Talk

McClenon Explains Theories
of Visible Surfaces of
Astral Body.

The moon was the chief subject or
the third of Professor McClcno s 3157
tronoiuy lecturcs last night. citing
Jules Vel‘nes' “From the Earth to the
Moon.” Mr. McClenon pointed out
that since there is one side of the
moon which will never be visible to
us. the wildest conjectures as to its
nature may be hazarded with impunr
ity.

Passing on to the features of tho
inoon which we can see. Mr. Mc—
Clenon called attention to obsolencc
of the theory that the ”craters" of
the moon are a result of volcanic
disturbance; the absence of any at-
mosphere or water precludes the pos
sibility of any burning there.

Mr. McClenon favors the theory
that the “craters" are the remnants
of a terrific bombardment of meteor-
ites. and that the "rills" are fissures
in the moon‘s surface. He mentioned
also the apparent "seas" on the moon,
and told of the measurement of the
height of the mountains by their
shadows. -

other subjects touched on in the
lecture were the celestial equator.
and the ecliptic. which runs through
the signs of the Zodiac.

The fourth lecture will occur next
Tuesday night at 7:15 in Goodnow.
The subject will he “Time."

Announcement was also made of
the fact that if visibility is good the
telescope will be brought out Friday
evening at 8:00 to see Jupiter's satel-
lites. which will cross the planet's
face. making a shadow as they go.

‘the last war. namely. the defense of

that we entered the war to make the
world safe for democracy and to
ﬁght a war to end war.

“While in later years many have
said that we were not actuatethy
such high motives. I personally feel
that the great majority of our peo—
ple were sincere in believing that
these things were the things we were
ﬁghting for." declared Professor
Gannaway. .

ing the game with only seven men.
The score does not indicate the tre-
mendous advantage that Smith held
over her opponents from the start.
but the fact that ‘the Smith goal was
not threatened once during the en‘
tire game and that the ball did not
penetrate Smith territory but eight
times throughout the encounter
clearly shows what a walk-away the
game turned out to be.
