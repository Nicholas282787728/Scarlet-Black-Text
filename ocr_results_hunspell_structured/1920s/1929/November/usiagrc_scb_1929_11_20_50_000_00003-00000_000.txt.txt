-Whitmer Rumsey, known in the
boxing world as “the boy wonder of
the universe,”_ received the following
eulogy in the "Roosevelt Roundup,"
the publication of his junior alma»
mater. He‘ is called' "the wonder,”
because everybody wonders how he
got into college.

"Whitmer Rumsey, former Roosevelt—
ian, is now a boxing and speedball
artist at Grinnellv. Rumsey, who was
prominent for his all around work
at Roosevelt, butkwho was never in-
terested in the athletic field, has on—
ly been boxinglfor a shortitilneﬁlt
is rumored that he has become an
excellent boxer."

It is rumoured that unless the
handsome, dark, swarthy cheecked
Cleysteen has a date at least once a
day for the next five weeks with a
certain Cottage Five inmate, he is
doomed the victim of an hour of bar-
baric torture in whatever form the
other member of this contract may
decide on. This report is conﬁrmed
by a triply sealed and witnessed
document (now in a safe) and by the
visit of both his parents this past
week-end.

Preps‘Meet I. Q T’. 7
Reserves Saturday

Displaying better organization in
this week‘s practices than any other
time this season, Gtinnell’s prep
eleven will tackle the State Teachers
reserve squad on Saturday at Ward
field. Two things mar the prospect
for a victory, however. The State
Teachers have displayed .a good team
this year, having defeated the, Coe
frosh earlier in the season, MacMil-
lian. star lineman, who has been in-
jured before this year, was hurt
again last night and will be out of
the contest.

Although Grinnell has not showed
the power of last years prep team,
they have a rather rangy forward
wall, and a fairly fast backfield.
Coach Truesdale believes that it was
due to lack of organization that the
fresh gridders were beaten so badly
at Drake, and he hopes to put a
smooth running aggregation on the
field Saturday.

The probable line-up for Grinnell
will be: left end, Southwick; left
tackle, Bowlby"left guard. Wilson;
center, Simms: right guard, ,olish;
right tackle, Hamilton; right end,
Barrow; quarter, Ullrich or Allison:
left hqfhack, James or Alexander;
right halfback, McCurtly or Figland;
fullback, Grhflund.
