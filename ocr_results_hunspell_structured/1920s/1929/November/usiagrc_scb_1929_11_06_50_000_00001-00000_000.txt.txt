Pioneer Chest

Campaign Nets
Nearly $1,000

Drive Brings Larger Amount
Than It Has for Some

Years in Past.

Quad Drive Still On

Amount of Faculty Pledges Is Not
Yet Reported; Will Go to
,' Glitmell-in—Glljnd.

With the annual Pioneer Chest
campaign officially closed, a check-
up reveals that the drive was one of
the most successful of recent years.
Nearly a thousand dollars was raised
by the men and women of the college,
while the sum raised among the fac-
ulty has not yet been reported.

The drive, sponsored by the Y. M.
C. A., Y. W. c. A, and the Grinnell-
ianhina movement, began last
Monday evening. In the quadrangle
g small amount of canvassing still
remained to be done, however. and
pledges will be taken there until Fri-
day noon of this week.

On Monday evening the quad-
rangle reported a total of $476 rais-
ed, while the dorms and town men
followed closely with $450, Smith
hall lead the dorms, with pledges of
394, followed by Dibble, with 374.50;
Langan, with $73.50; Clark. with
:72; Four, with $58.50; town men.
with $45.50 and Building Three, with
$15. A detailed report from the
quadrangle has not yet been made.
The campaign was directed by a
j nt committee, comprising Walter
Secor and Lewis Troyer from the Y.
M. C. A., and Blanche Hulsebus and
Elizabeth Cook from the Y. W. C. A.
Canvassing among the faculty is in
charge of Mr. Wehrhan. who is of-
ficial representatives of the Grinnell-
ianhina movement.

Drive Is Success,

The sum raised was a good deal
short of the two thousand dollar
goal, but neveretheless was one of
the most successful drives in recent
years. The money will be divided
among the three organizations and
will be used for n varied number of
improvements. The redecorated Y,
W. C. A. rooms, the various social
functions, the General reception and
other similar activities will require a
heavy expense, The department of
Vocational Guidance also requires
money for the outstanding speakers
secured at intervals of the school
year. Many campus services carried
on by the associations such as pub-
lishing the freshman handbook,
sponsoring by the Y. W. of the big
and little sister groups, and stressing
church relationships,

The Grinnelloin-Chind movement is
a project carried on by students,
faculty, alumni, and local church
support. Through the plan,
two schools for boys and girls
are maintained in Techow, China,
and the salary of a Grinnell man who
teaches there is paid, Don Fessler.

This collection was established
by a gift in order to give Grin-
nell students the opportunity to
see and read new books which the
Library could not afford to pure
chase in the regular way. Collec-
tions of this sort are distinctly
successful in other schools, but if
we cannot make the collection pay
for itself after the gift is exhauste
ed there will be nothing to do but
to discontinue it altogether.

Norman Thomas, Socialist Leader,

Will Talk at Grinnell February 24

Norman Thomas, candidate for the
presidency on the Socialist Ticket
last year and just yesterday defeated
for mayor of New York City, Will
speak in Grinnell on the evening of
February 24 under the auspices of
the local Y. M. c. A. and Y. W. C.
A., it was announced this week. The
Pcacc committee of the Y. w., un—
der Marcia Cohclan, has charge of ar-
rangements for his coming.

As in the mayoralty campaign just
over in New York, so in his candi-
dacy for the Presidency, Thomas up-
held the rcputation he has long had
as a man of high capabilities and
character, Born in Ohio, he was or-
dained a minister in 1911, remaining
active as a clergyman until 1918, in
which year he founded the magazine
“The World Tomorrow," which he
edited until 1921, and in which be
outlined his policies for a new social
order. In 1921 and 1922 he was edi-
tor of the "Nation” and since the lat
ter year has been active in the
League for Industrial Democracy.

He entered politics in 1924, when
he ran for governor of New York on
the Socialist ticket. In 1925 he was
a candidate for mayor of New York.
In the presidential campaign last
year he received the support of many
of the intellectual group in this coun»
try. At Grinnell, a Thomas-for-

Prcsidcnt club was active for a
month preceding election, standing
for him because he favored the inter-
ests of the farmer and laborer as
opposed to the privileged classes, and
because of his enlightcned stand on
international relations.

While defeated, in the election in
New York yesterday be pulled the
largest socialist vote for mayor in
the history of that city. Early re-
ports gave lnm 117,000 votes, with
all indications that he would receive
more than the 145,000 given to Hill-
quit in 1917. Both the New York
World and the New York Telegram
stood for him and in the past two
weeks there has been a remarkable
drift to his side.

Even the New York Sun declared
of him in his candidacy for
mayor: “The quiet, earnest clergy-
man and editor has been carrying
patiently the banner with little re-
ward and now by an amazing twrst
of politics finds himself with a host
of dignified citizens proclaiming him
the man of the hour.” Of course
Thomas was defeated by the Demo-
cratic candidate, Mayor Walker, who
won the election, and by the Radical
Republican, La Guardia, but his
showing is indicative of the personal-
ity of the man who will speak here
on February 24.

 

Tutors’ Session
to Hear Faculty

Will Listen to Ryan, Nollen,
Dreese, Perring, Smith

at Des Moines.

Several members of the Grinnell
faculty will appear on the program
of \he seventyrﬁfth annual session
of the Iowa State Teachers’ associa-
tion to be held in Des Moines
November 7, B, and 9.

Dean John S. Nollen will address
the modern 'language section on
"European Summer Schools,” and

“Maintaining Language Intttrest,”
before the same group.

Mrs. Flora Smith will deliver a re-
port on the First Anglo-American
Conference on Public School Music
which was held at Lausane, Switzer-
land this summer. Mrs. Smith was
the only person from Iowa to attend
this conference, which was the ﬁrst
meeting of its kind. She found that
British schools. in spite of their
historic background. were far less
advanced than American schools in
the teaching of music.

Professor John P. Ryan will ad—
dress the section of speech teachers
on the subject “The Teacher of
Speech,” Professor Mitchell Dreese
will speak on "Guidance Technique”
before the vocational guidance group.

Two members of the faculty hold

tions. Miss Clara J, Andersen is
secretary of the department of
health education, and Professor E.

Pioneer Frosh
to Play Drake

To Battle Saturday Night
Against Very Strong

Bullpup Teal-n,

When the Pioneer Frosh meet the
Drake yearling squad in their night
clash Saturday, the Grinnell team is
going to have a battle on their hands
as the Des Moines school boasts the
best freshman team in their history.

Led by such stars as Webb of Des
Moines. Cammacksof Newton, Pound
of Fort Madison, Mountain of Valley
Junction, and others of the same
caliber, the Drake squad will present
a powerful eleven, and will prove
worthy foes for the local squad.

Grinnell's team, though light, is
very scrappy, and should give a good
account of themselves. Coach Trues—
dale has been working his men hard
and will have lots to show the Des
Moines eleven in the way of football
tactics.

The probable line-up for Grinnell
will be as follows: left end, south-
wick; left tackle, MacMillan; left
guard. Mart or Simms; center, Bowls
by or Horn; right guard, Wilson or
Olish; right tackle, Hamilton; right
end, Barrows or Pojman; quarter
back, Ulrich or Allison; left half-
back, Amcs or be Windt; right half»
back, McCurdy or Alexander; full-
back. Craflund,

Linemen who are sure to get into
the game are Behr, Danforth, and
Reney. Figland and Livingston will
be given a chance in the backfield.
The others on the squad will be used
whenever the occasion presents itself.

 

Culture Enters Dorm Dining Hall
as Classes, Apart, Nibble Viands

Digmity and prop ety have invade
ed the men’s dining room at last.
Here in the scene of gastronomic edi-
fication where man’s primal hungers
have held full sway, the civilizing
forces of sobriety and order have tin-
ally penetrated. The mad horde
which was wont heretofore to rush
madly down to the nether dormitor-
ial regions and gorge unrestrainedly
the mess hurled upon them by hust-
ling waiters, has been transformed
as though by magic into groups of
orderly, refined youth who daintily
pick their ways to assigned tables to
partake of breakfast, luncheon, or
dinner, according to the hour of the
day.

The transformation has been
wrought by the application of class
distinctions and the apportionment of
table places on a stringent caste
basis. Now the lordly seniors, purer
gons of refinement and culture, those
intensive studies in the ultimate, Con-
stitute the dining room aristocracy.
Aloof and superior they sit. associab
ing not with the common rabble, but
nibbling at their food and supping

 

their coffee or milk in dainty and
delicate fashion befitting the elite.
Juniors Undcrstudy Seniors

The ambitious and rising juniors
are not far lower in the new social
scale. Understudies to the seniors,
they share in their glory, and in some
cases are even permitted to sit at
table with them. Extremely hour-
geois are the sophomore tablcs
and here, indeed are found lingering
remnants of the old convivial board
of yore before caste and culture rc-
placed appetite, Cf the freshman
tables, the less said the better, for
these callow youths, unschooled in
dormitory dining technique, with ens
ormous appetites, yet endeavoring
earnestly to comply with the new
code of refinement, suffer immense—
ly under the new system.

Men Must Learn Ncw Habits

Sunday evening was a sad time for
many dormitorians. Dining room
friends of long standing bid farce
wells and tears flowed copiously as
old table comrades consumed their
last meal together. The new era

Harriers Beat
Parsons, 18-37

Team Prepares for Tutors;
Intramural, Individual

Meets Are Soon.

With another victory behind them
the Pioneer barriers are pointing to
their toughest meet of the season
when they come up against the
strong State Teachers college team
on Ward ﬁeld next Friday.

Last Saturday the local team
easily defeated the Parsons college
runners, 18 to 37, at Falrdeld, Cap-
tain Secor of Grinnell won ﬁrst place
over the four and eight»tenths miles
course. Mcllratb, of Crinnell was
close behind Secor, with Anderson of
Parsons third. Pye. McCandless, and
Murphy followed in the order named
and four Parsons runners, Allen,
Zillman, Cowan, and Woods took the
remaining places. Captain Secor-s
time for the course was 25:28. Me—
llrath, who formerly ran for Parsons,
beat his old teammate Captain And-
erson more than a hundred yards.
Grinnell is still undefeated.

With only one more week to pre-
pare for the annual Intramural cross
country meet, the various dorm
teams are making a final effort to
put their squads in top condition.
All entries are in now and the ﬁnish-
ing touches are being made for the
meet, which takes place Thursday
afternoon, November 14.

Final preparations are also being
made for the indi idual meet which
comes on Tuesday, November 12.
Anyone in school is eligible and may
enter at any time prior to the after-
noon of the meet. Medals will be
awarded to ﬁrst and second place
winners.

Party Resolution
Passed by Council

At. the student council meeting
held last Thursday, a resolution was
discussed and passed to the effect
that from now on those attending a
house party or informal open houses
on the nights of house parties
should not leave their own party to
visit others taking place on the cam-
pus.

The resolution was passed for two
reasons. It was felt that under the
new plan this year whereby every
man in every dormitory pays his
building assessment to the college
treasurer at the beginning of the
year and is thus eligible to attend
the house party, the dorm clubrooms
in which many of the parties are
held wlll be so crowded that for vis-
itors to come in from other parties
will cause inconvenient congestion.
Then, too, it was felt that the dorm
or cottage giving a party desires to
keep that party the private affair
which it is intended to be.

Business Houses to Close
for Game Friday Afternoon

Grinnell business houses will close
Friday afternoon for Community
Day. This holiday has been declared
in order that the business men may
see the game wrth State Teachers.

In former games on Saturday at-
ternoons, the business men have not
been able to leave their shops. It is
expected that many of the townspeo—
ple will attend thc game.

Mrs. . C, Rockafcllow visited her
daughter Sue Monday night while on
her way to Chicago.

 

Squad Points
for Teachers
Game Friday

Varsity Trample on Fresh
Monday; Find Going

Harder Since.

Watt Expects Battle

To Count on Work of Richey, Ruff
and McIntire to Average

Last Year‘s Tie.

With the Grinnellostate Teachers
game here booked as one of the
leading gridiron contests of the state
Friday, Coach Fuzz Watt started his
Pioneer regulars over the rocky road
of training Monday, after a week of
easy life following a 6 to 6 tie with
Drake.

The state Teachers contest Friday
will mark the opening of the latter
part of the season, with the Pioneers
meeting ll state Teachers, Carleton
and Creighton in order, and doped to
win after a ﬁrst rate early season
showing. The Tutors are invading
Grinnell with two victories and two
losses to their credit. The Pioneers,
although they have only two victori-
es, have only one loss and a pair of
tie games.

The Pedagogs hold the lead in the
Iowa conference with a pair of vic-
tories, defeating Penn 13 to 1 and
Sjmpson 7 to o. Grinnell took a 13
to win over Penn in the first game
of the season. Capt. Dave McCuskey
an'd Fritzel of the Tutors are a pair
of constant threats, however, who
are gunning for recognition in their
work here, The two losses marked
against the record of the Teachers
include the 7 to o defeat by Coe in
the season's opener and the game
dropped to the Missouri Teachers at
Kirksville.

Varsity Opposes Fresh

In addition to defeating Penn, the
Pioneers kicked the dope bucket
about recklessly to trim Marquette
at Milwaukee, 9 to 7 and to tie
Washington a to o and Drake e to 6.
The only black spot on the Pioneer
snowing is the 27 to 7 defeat at
Ames.

This week's practice opened au-
spiciously when the varsity went
against the freshmen. after the
yearlings had spent a week in con—
centrated drill on both offensive and
defensive formations. and scored
four touchdowns in ﬁfteen plays.
Russell Ruff, who showed that, in
addition to being a kicker and pass-
er, he was a ballocdrrier at Drake,
took the kickooff from the frosh and
sprinted 95 yards to a touchdown.
The next score was a hard earned
affair on a series of ﬁve to 10-yard
line drives.

jaunt around left end and the fourth
