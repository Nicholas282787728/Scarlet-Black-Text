The college hclo, Davis Greene, is
back in the lime-light again! It's
quite some time since he picked up
his empty revolver and chased the
quadrangle pest. He'll be winning
more than track medals before long!

Due to the fact that there is no
"Shopper" today. we'll have to do a
little advertislng right here: “Oh gear
on joy! Just wait until you see those
boys blossom out in their nifty green
and white striped blazers. with the
Smith hall crests! You’ll wish you
had one, too—all seven of you who
don’t. Hurry and see John Earner!
He can tell you where to order one!
C'mon now—they're hotsy!”

This requirement must be continuously
anticipated to provide leaders for the
future. Accordingly, each year, more
than 400 picked college graduates come
to the General Electric Company for
a post-graduate course in electrical

science.

With a faculty including inventors and

something more than electrical knowl-

Here they also ﬁnd inspiration which
prepares them for leadership in this
