GRINNELL mom.

In the beginning, when folks were intelligent, they
made rules for puny generations to come. Sunday dates
were henceforth taboo, chapel programs Were made se—
crets to be whispered at faculty teas, and smoking was
ior rmughty maids in dark corners.

Later giant intellect: bequeathed more traditions uni
til now, the only justification needed [or a practice is
Custom. \Vhy make chapel programs mysteries and
Sunday dates crimes? Other arguments may fail but the
classic one still holdsﬁit's the custom.

‘Vhy no cars, why cross the street to smoke? Not
because cars are expensive or cigarette stubs mur the
caulpusirhther, it's tradition. \Vhy open only one din-

Thou there is the danger of starting a tradition.
\Vhy no Victory (lily? it might begin a tradition. Why
no men in the Quadrangle loggiu on week nights? A
custom might spring up.

Tradition is rounded on that unquestioned (mom,

and heathen.

In Grinnell there are two kinds or people, those who
rollow the custom and those who don't.

ALL IS WELT: ALONG THE I’DTOMAC

Monday, America has a change of adminis 1tlon
which, the Chicago Tribune and other newspapers ad-
mitting their ability to see into the future der
clare, will not endanger Coolidge prosperity two points
on the stock market. Nor should it he difﬁcult to make
such a prophecy for, as Mr, Mencken has observed, "Mr.
Hoover is only a (at Mr. Coolidge” and business can not
be expected to sufler when one economist succeeds his
prototype.

\Vere Mr. Coolidge disposed, he might observe that
the election last [all was forerordalned. A press which
{or tllree years printed cartoons to the citect that
“Hoover is the man“ had the country believing lt last
spring. A machine managed by such leaders as Mcllou
arid Coolidge, working silently, 'smonthly, relentlessly.
nominated him at Kansas City as farmers stood aghast
and the most elfecﬁre riolitical [orce existing, G, 0. P.,
carried him to a victory which did not leave Mr. Smith
his home sthte.

Monday Mr. Hoover will he president and, reactionr
ﬂl')’ watchmen observe, all is well along the Potomac.

WHAT! ANOTHER ASSESSMEN’ 1

While to add another fee to those which make up the
Gelrnztn debt the average strident pays to the treasurer
each fall and winter seems, at Iii-st thought. to be add-
ing the extra straw, in reality, the proposal to make
building dues payable at the college office at the begin—
ning of each semester is the most convenient method
which has been devised both for students and buildings.

From the standpoint oi each building, the total
amount assessed will be larger because more men will
pay and collection will be more eifi cut \vhilc from the
student's view tell dollars when paid along with the
usual three-hundredJiﬂy is less than pin money. But
if the debt is left until midrsenlester the mention of ten
dollars brings visions of bltnkruptcy.

Tile plan provides both for the fact that it costs a.
large building more [or favors and smokers and that it
IS just as expensive for the small building to hire a dance
orchestra as it is for at large one. A flat rate of three
dollars per man is paid to each building and the remain-
ing money is divided among the dorms equally.

To adopt the proposal seems good business.

Falrness and Rivalry
In Basketball Season

(Continued from Palm 1)
the Creighton Bluejays easiiy swept
to 2 victory over Grihnell with a leng-
thy outﬁt of dead shots. It was
admittedly one of the classiest quin-
tets ill the corn belt. Another hard
blow to take was the Knox defeat by
one point in an overtime period. After
trimming Carleton, the class in the
Midwest conference here, the fans
looked to the Pioneers to return with
the Knox scalp but again the cards

weren't lying right.

As to victories, four of them clear-
ly showed superior playing by the
Grinnellizlns. In the first 008 game,
both Penn games and the Augustana_
contest, Grinnell had a. clear playing
edge all the way. The first Carle—
ton contcst, however, and the final
Marquette fracas are different tales.
Ruth went on the Grinnell Victory
column by one point margins and
they managed that only through the
spirited battle which the Pioneers
staged on the home ﬂoor.
