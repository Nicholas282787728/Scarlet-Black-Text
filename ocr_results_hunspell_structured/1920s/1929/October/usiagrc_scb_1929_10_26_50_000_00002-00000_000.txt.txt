THE CARNEGIE REPORT.
Now that the ﬁrst sensational blast of the report of
the Carnegie foundation on college and university ath-
letics has blown over, and it is seen that the various foot-
ball teams are still playing scheduled games, most fol-
lowers of college athletics are willing to admit, with
Westbrook Pegler of the Chicago Tribune. that the “re-
velations" really were not so surprising, after all. Re-
cruiting and subsidizing of athletes have been common
practices in many institutions in America for years, and
everyone with two eyes and two cars has known it.

’ Arnommomsense View of the sit ation recognizes
,Nthnt the systemattaclred in the Cnrneg'd report hiss been
Jhtndelnjéwtihle by the mushroomug'rowth to ’populsri
of college athletics, football particularly. It also re-
cognizes that before the present regrettable situation can
he Tighted either Intercollegiate athletics must be

NO. 12

abolished or the present system of recruiting and sub-
sidizing must be brought under control of the educational
side of colleges anduniversities,

Is it necessary to recoil the growth of football to
popularity? Visualize. then. what has happened with
each succeeding year up to the present. Greater and
greater numbers have crowded the stadia. until greater
stadia have been required. The press has ballyhooed the
individual stars as Well as the games themselves. The
All-American teams have even been advertised by great
manufacturing ﬁrms as wearing their products To the
rising generation, nothing has seemed more to be desired
than to star on a college football team. Meanwhile the
necessity of having a winning team has come home to
coaches, students and alumni and they have all sought
after the choice stars produced by high schools and prop
schools, the alumni often providing the funds to attract
them and give them jobs. This was the start. The
result we have with us today. represented in the Carnegie
Report.

Shall we, then, abolish intercollegiate athletics? No.
‘No, by all means. no. The thrill of college football for
example, the thrill to Grinnellians of a. win Over Drake
or Iowa state are integral parts of college life. and
indications of real school spirit that should never be
cut off. '

Shall the recruiting of athletes he done away withl
Yes, bugit will have to be a long and gradual process,
so firmly is it rooted. If it could be worked out, college
institutions as a Whole should not be found any better or
worse off for athletic talent than today, for .the high
school athlete Who really desires a college education will
go somewhere to school. If he does not desire such an
education strongly enough to enroll as a student rather
than as an athlete, he is not greatly to be desired.

With those, however, who do not believe in giving
good opportunities to athletes, to earn their way through
college after entering the school of their choice without
being solicited to come, we take issue. We would even
favor the better and easier jobs being reserved for ath-
letes. If you will follow the amount of time and energy
given by a football player to the 'gridiron game in the
fall, you will see Why. Two hours and a half of the most
strenuous exercise every afternooniand for what?
That the athlete may make for ,his alma mater many
thousands of dollars on a Saturday afternoon. To the
athletes who,give generously of their time and energy
to produce a winning team, so generously that they are
often too tired to study a, great deal during football or
basketball season, to them the college owes the best self-
help jobs it can possibly give them. And if this is sub-
sidizing athletics, then we strongly favor it,

The safe and sane future for intercollegiate athletics
lies. not in the hands of the alumni. not in the hands or
athletic departments of the type investigated and found
wanting by the Carnegie foundation, but In the hands of
capable "'eireontives in the colleges and universities; who.
while sympathetic with college athletics! and the in-
dividual athlete‘ himself. yet will endea‘vor to make inter:
collegiate sports not the crown of college life, but the
integral pert that they should he. —Er D. A.

Drake will be assured of at least a

ry of a Drake-Grimell duel .playr
ed at night before the Drake home-I
coming crowd. tonoght’s contest has
assumed the proportions of the out
standing game to be played in the
Drake bowl this year. The largest
crowd of the season seems assured.
judging by advance ticket sales.

Bulldog fans are making no secret
of the fact that they have a genuine
fear of the famous Grinnell passing
attack.
