MAKE HOMECOMING A SUCCESS.

With the announcement yesterday that the faculty
had voted to hold no classes on Friday ofitbis week,
Grinnell students 'are assured of an opportunity to co-
operate with the college and city in, the
Jubilee and College Homecoming. The program has
been made out for the week's festivities, something
which in itself has taken months of preparation. Now
the student body largely holds the success of the
Jubilee in its hands.

Rock Island Gives Special
Rates for This Week-End

THE GRIN'NELL SCARLET AND BLACK

There is a time for study and a time for play?
This is one weekend when the student body is more
obligated to play than to work. It is our job as stu-
dents to inject into everything that goes on this week-
end a spiiit of enthusiasm that will make the program
more than a written one, that will make the alumni
who return, the former residents of Grinnell, and the
townspeople themselves look back on this Homecoming
as one well worth being remembered.

concretely expressed, this means that as many as
possible should attend the historical pageant which
has been produced at,an expenditure of months of
labor. It means that the church services on Sunday
should be included in the student's schedule for the
weekend. As for the air races, the pep meeting, the
pep parade, the Homecoming dance and the Washing»
ton-Crinncll game, we hardly believe that anyone
needs to'he reminded of them. It is our opportunity,
this Jubilee and Homecoming, to leave an impression

of Grinnell spirit that Will not soon be forgotten.
E. D, A.

THE NEW SCHEDULE

There can be no doubt that the new ’system of
having Tuesday, Thursday and Friday classes 01‘ Mon-
day. Tuesday and Thursday classes was introduced by
the faculty to satisfy the strong student sentiment
against Saturday recitations. Therefore a criticism of
the new schedule is not intended as a criticism of those
who devised it.

One of the chief difficulties with the new system
is that it causes an unbalanced .week. Whereas last
yeai',,the sixteen hours of work were divided fairly
evenly between the MWF and TTHS combinations,
this year the MWF division must take on an additional
afternoon class. In many cases this makes that one
day unusually heavy.

Another difficulty in the schedule is that in cases
whgre classes occur on consecutive days the ordinary
amount of preparation for the second period cannot
be expected. This seriously interferes with the budget
for the year-’5 work.

Still another handicap which the experiment lays
upon both instructor and student is that the variation
in class time makes adjustment difficult and prevents
the course from settling down into the general routine.

If Saturday classes can be eliminated by the subs

'stituticn of a satisfactory system for the one followed

last year, such a substitution would be very desirable,
but if they can only be eliminated by Causing Compli-
cations in the working week. then, perhaps it might

be better to continue last year‘s schedule.

Pacifism Defended‘
by Libby Monday

Frederick J. Libby, executive sec—
retary for the Council on prevention
of War expressed in chapel Monday
morning his concept of two conflict-
ing loyalties: loyalty to country and
loyalty to Christ. He was introduced
by Prof. Charles E. Payne.

“It is profoundly important that
we will see clearly these two loyalr
ties, l' declared Mr. Libby, General
John F. O'Ryan, speaking on the
necessity for clear thinking on the
question of bearing arms said, ”When
I go to war it is with frankness and
sincerity. I know that I am leaving
Christ. at home.” Commenting on
General O‘Ryan‘s statement, thc
speaker said, "If you are convinced
that war and Christianity are Irre—
concilable, which will- you choose,
Caesar or Christ?" In the long run
that inner voice of yours is going to
talk to you. Many who fought are
today repenting in sackcloth and ash-
es for their conduct."

not quite ready to subscribe to pacif»
ism, who remarked, “When war
comes, I’ll go, but if you see me
marching down the street, don’t
cheer." The attitude of frankness is
becoming the modern etitude, Mr.
Libby thinks. It is, he said, prob
ably as far as the student is ready to
go now.

“To deliberately put Christ above
Caesar is a very serious matter,” com
cludcd Mr. Libby.
