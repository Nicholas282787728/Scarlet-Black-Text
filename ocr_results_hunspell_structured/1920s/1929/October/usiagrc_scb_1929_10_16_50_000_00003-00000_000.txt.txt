Cyclone Tebbcns had a great time
with one of the waitresses in Bishop’s
cateteria last Friday, He fell madly
in love with her. and ate about seven
meals within six hours, so that he
could be near her, All the way home
he raved about her, but by Sunday
was reconciled to hcr loss, saying
that he had_found a Grinnell waitress
that was just as good. And that, of
course, is the kind of a girl Crinnell
men really want._

The man who used to say “I can’t smoke until after
lunch . . . my throat; is sensitive in the morning”
now ﬁnds that he can “light up" whenever he pleases.
For his morning oLD GOLD has no more throat-

scratch than his breakfast omelet.
