Pioneers, Bears

Meet Today for
Eleventh Time

When the Pioneers and the Bears
meet in the Homecoming game to-
day. it will be the eleventh time than
they have opposed each other on the
gridiron. Grinnell has taken the
long end of the score six times out
of ten, scoring 124 points to Wash.
ington's 66.

Back in the nineties one game was
played, resulting in a 30—0 victory tor
Grinnell. r Their ﬁrst encounter in
“modern" times took place in 1920,
when Washington Staged a. remark-
able comeback in the second half and
defeated Grinnell 23-14 after being
behind 14»6 at the end of the ﬁrst
half.

1921 Game Close.

In 1921 the game was very close,~
the Bears again coming out on the
long end of a 14-13 score. The
game in 1922 was a decisive victory
'for the wearers of the Scarlet and
Black and they Won 16—0. which
marked the ﬁrst Missouri Valley
Conference victory for Crinnell. The
Pioneers duplicated their victory in
1523 and took the Bears 15-2.

Grinnell seemed to like Washing-
ton teams, for in 1924 they again
swept them off their feet by a 14-0
score.

In 1925 they were not so for-
tunate and Washington nosed out

3—0. The powerfud team of 1926 was ,

again too good for Washington and
they were forced to take the short
end of a 7-0 score. Washington re-
venged that in 1927 and scored a 18-
7 victory over the Pioneers.
Grinncll 1928 Vlcmr.

Last year the Scarlet and Black
team. went to St. Louis and nosed out
the Bears in a 7-6 game, winning in
the last quarter. It all happened
when Washington was forced to punt
from their own 20 yard line. "Red"
Fall blocked the punt, and line plays.
two passes and a triple lateral pass
with Rose receiving accounted for six
points. The winning margin came
from the toe of Russell Ruff.

Governor Hammill made the prin-
cipal address at the Airport Dedica-
tion yesterday morning 2

In speaking on the recent develop-
ment of airplane traffic, he said. “I
think the day is very near at be
when our citizens will be ﬁyi
around in airplanes just as we travel
about in motor cars today. In place
of those sensational and romantic
episodes that ushered in airplanes,
we are gradually building a system
of air transportation that I believe
will be of the utmost importance in
the social and economic progress of
this country."

Old Anthem to he Sung.

The Jubilee program continued
Friday evening with a repetition of
the historical pageant. Today is be«
ing devoted to activities at the Cole
lege. Sunday morning will witness

eleven o’clock, with both the Metbo»
dist and Congregational church choirs
presenting Lowell Mason's old an»

Barton, nationally known Congrega-
tional clergyman. biographer of
Abraham Lincoln and lecturer, will
deliver an address at a union service
at the Congregational.

At the college a special musical
vesper service is being held in the

which the prologue consisted.

”Go West, young man, go West,
and grow up with the country,“ open-
ed the pageant proper, for Horace
Greeley's famous advice to .l. B,
Grinnell in 1853 began the train of
events. Greeley's part was ably pre
sented by the Rev. E. M. Vittum. A.

J. Blakeley played the part of Grin-
neil.

Covered Wagon on Stage.

1854 found Grinnell, Homer Ham—
lin, and Dr. Thomas Holyokc decid—
ing upon a sight for the town. In
the same year the ﬁrst settlers ar-
rived in a covered wagon, which ap~
peered upon the stage. Upon the
stage also appeared the ﬁrst timbers
of the Long Home.

The consecration of the Iowa Band
was next in point of history. The
merging of Iowa college and Crinnell
university occurred in 1857. Present
day college students, playing the
parts of scholars in the ante-bellum
period, discussed the amusing and
rather native college rules.

The maintenance of a station in
Grinnell on the Underground Rails
way was acted in the next two
scenes by the appearance of Capt.
John Brown and the smuggling of
slaves into a GIinnell home. Mrs. R.
M. Halnes played the part of a
grandmother.

I-iarlnng back to the old ways of
dancing, students made merry at a
huslrihg bee and surreptitiously tread
a measure to The Girl I Left Berind
Me.

In succeeding scenes the college
students, led by Principal Parker,
marched of: to war. An attempt
was made to establish a saloon in
the town. In 1863 the ﬁrst railroad
train appeared. In 1565 the town
celebrated the end of the war.

Flve Faculty Members.

In the ﬁnal episode Grinnell be-
came a full—hedged college when it
welcomed as president Mr. Magoun.
Five faculty members sufficed to in—
struct the student body at that time.

In a dance interlude the cyclone of
1582 was depicted The spirit of
Grinnell and her helpers at the altar
of learning were overthrown for a
time, but when the whirl wind had
subsided the altar was rebuilt. The
lighting upon name-colored costumes
and burnished altar was particularly
good in this dance.

was shown at the center of the stage
The spirits of the past moved behind

though in a mist, They paused re-
verently before the statue of Grin-
hell, the Post, the Present, and the

Taft Lectures
on ‘Parthenon’

Famous Greek Structure is
Biggest Thing in Art,
Says Sculptor.

“Phidias and the Parthenon" was
the subject of the lecture delivered
by Lnrado Taft Wednesday evening
at eight o'clock in Herrick chapel,
The lecture was the second in a
series of ﬁve which Mr. Taft will de-
liver this fall.

A discussion of the Parthenon is a
discussion of the biggest thing in the
history of art, Mr. Taft said, and res
presents the standard of achievement
to which these people had attained in
the age of Pericles, the ﬁfth century
before Christ.

Phidins' Work Unexplained.

Ictinus and Callicrates were the
architects for the building and
Phidiss, the attending sculptur. Pro-
bably very little, if any, of the work
was from his hand, Mr. Taft said,
but the only traces or suggestions of
Phidias' work that we have is on
the Parthenon; his own masterpieces
have all Vanishedﬁeven the lovely
ivory and gold statue of Athena.
which was near the western end of
the calla in the Parthenon, has van-
ished without a trace. Phidias was
perhaps the greatest sculptor who
ever lived. although it is hard to
judge him so many hundreds of
years after his time.

Parthenon Not Immense.

The Parthenon is not an immense
structure, being only two hundred
and twenty—eight feet long by one
foot wide: it is approached from the
west end, the back of the building, as
you ascend the Acroplis

The lecture was illustrated with
slides showing many of the sculptur-
al groups of the metopes and of the
pedimental sculpture.

Mr. Taft's next lecture, the subject
of which is "Praxiteles and His Suc-
cessors" will be given next week on
Tuesday evening at eight o'clock in
Herrick chapel.

neli homecoming crowds
will be out for blood.

Huff’s passing and kicking, which
d ighted the returning grads in
1 23, will again be one of the greatly
looked for events of the day.

The Washington university men.
headed by Captain Harvey Jablonsky,
will also be out for victory, however.
They are in ﬁrst class shape with
the exception of one end, Wientge.
In the ten games between the two
elevens, Grinnell has won six as
compared with the four taken by the
Bears. Not at all satisﬁed with this
record, Coach Al Sharpe has inform»
ed his team that they must take
home a victory or suffer serious cons
sequences.

Visitors Attircd in Scarlet.

Neither team spent Friday night

in Crinnell. Coach Watt took his
men away from the city immediately
after dinner, and did not return until
early this afternoon. The Washing
ton crew also stayed away from the
celebration here until just before the
game.
Contrary to the usual custom, it
will he Grinnell in the black sweaters
today while the Bears will he wear-
ing a complete outﬁt of scarlet from
headgears to shoes. Even the trolls-
ers of the visitors are reported to be
of a scarlet shade. Most of the
numbers of the Grinnell men are the
same as on the old sweaters although
Captain Rose will be sporting a
number one instead of his former two
which has been transferred to
Thomas.

and they

people, alumni and visitors will be
held at the quadrangle, with the
Mississippi Six playing. The annual
reunion for men, usually held in
Smith hall clubroom, will he held in
the recreation room of tho quadrangle

Tomorrow's activities include spec-
iu services at the churches and a
musical vespcr service at Herrick
chapel, concluding with a union serv-
ice at the Congregational church to-
morrow night, with Dr. William E.
Barton as the speaker.

Mr. Richardson, who students and
instructors alike know “Dad,"
fixing
showers in the men's gym to recall
some of the good old days that have
passed during his fourteen years at
Crinneli. Dad says that many of the
old athletes come back for homecom-
ing, and some of the nearby grads
come for all the football games; they
all remember him and come over to
the gym to visit him.

as
found time yesterday while

Coach watt was one of the men on
the 1917 championship eleven Grin-
nell had when "Dad" came here.
"They had a great team in those
days," he said. "They’ve been falling
behind the last few years but there's

lots of good material this year and
when they get their pep up I look to
see them best these other fellows."

“One thing they need around here
is a new gym. Probably there would
be a. new one now if it hadn't been
for hard times," Dad commented, "I
expect one will be built within the
next few years. When the A. R. H.
was built, the construction superins
tendcnt told me Grihnell needed a
new music hall worse than a gym, so
I guess we have to wait for that,"

“Yes, the old boys come aroun_d to
see ’Ddd’ when they are back, and
they are a fine bunch of fellows.
Well, these showers are better than
they were anyway," he said as he
finished his task.
