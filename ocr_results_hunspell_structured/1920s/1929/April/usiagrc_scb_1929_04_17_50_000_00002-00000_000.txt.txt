Still Another M ariagement

As a new management takes over the SCARLET
AND BLACK, little change will be noted in editorial
policies. As in the past, it will be independently con-
servative following college authority where that author-
ity is reasonable yet reserving the right to object.

Student government, voluntary chapel, a liberal cut
system and nomreppiug measures will 'be supported by
the new SCARLET AND BLACK. 0n the other hand,
there will he a distinct stand against customs as no Sun-
day dating. secret chapel programs, (acuity interference

in student government and other evils which have long
been sheltered by tradition,

G 'nnell, like the rest of the world, is changing and
there is oitcu rcasnn tor the present administration to
he lax where past ones have been strict. The idea that
co—ells cannot take care of themselves alter ton on wcclr
nights and eleven-thirty on Saturdays today is as rear
sortable as blue law and the concept or no smoking on
the campus finds as its only excuse for existing the dan-
ger or cigaret stuhs cluttering the campus.

t'hangcs, of course, must he gradual, but it is hoped
that the 1929, 15730 administration will he lenient toward
quddrnngle smokers, less secretive about chapel pro-
grams and more attentive to socially inclined on Friday

nights.

Tradition Again Passes

There will be some regrct at the passing of the old
SCARLET AND BLACK headline. The Gothic caption
has long been as much a part or the Grinnell paper as
the name so many will ieel that it should he kept as a
sacred tradition.

However, the adoption 0! a lower case Chcltoninn
trpci‘ace with this issue is only iollowing the trend of
modern journalism. The New York Herald Tribune used
such captions ten years ago and papers have been quick
to take them up either as part or all of their headline
style sheets Lower case heads owe their existence to
their legihiilty. Where a line of capitals is only a blur-
red mess one or capitals and small letters is easy to
read.

The Cheltonian family, adopted by the SCARLET
AND is not as artistic as many but it is among the most
legible.

For Better Understanding

With the selection or John H. Spencer and Donald
Brudine as speakers on the Undergraduate Speaking e.
change, the second year or co-operation between Grim
nell students and other callegians begins, Tile program,
though expensive, is one or the most valuable instituted
here.

While local representativds oiticially go to other
schools to describe conditions at Grinnell, they have a
chance to see how other institutions are managed. The
practice or sending speakers here was begun by Eeloit a
week ago and no doubt many other schools will send
Speakers here in the next few years ,

Colleges are lending to become more triendly, The
bloodthirsty athletic rivalry of twenty years ago still‘
exists but the batrcd which went wrth it seems to have
passed. The barriers or :lealousy break down as schools
know each other better and representatives exchanged‘L
between schools tend to promote this needed understand-
