Haines Best Director

Judges Point Out “Nina.” as Act
Best Produced; All Plays
Called Excellent.

By Virginia Riniker.

WlLll Margaret Weishnor being
awarded the Henry York Steiner prize
for her play “Long lrlsnuels" and
Pearl Hsines rcceivng the prize given
by the Experimentul Theatre for her
direction of “Nina," honors were
equally shared between the two most
excellent productions in the program
of original one act plays produced
last Wednesday and Timrsday eve-
nings in the auditorium of A. R. H.

“Money for Orchids" written and di-
rected by Margaret Napier was the
first play given, and held the atten-
tion of the audience throughout. The
best acting on both evenings was

’ done in this play by Richard Phillips
who took the part of Pops Davidson,
the stage doorman. lie was given only
fair support by other members 0! the
cast, all of whom made good appear-
ances but whose acting was inferior
to his own , :

“Crude Oil” Smooth

"Crude Oil," written by Arthur Ris-
ser and directed by Mary Stevenson.
had more local color than any of the
other plays and was typical of the
kind of life it represented. The work
of Elizabeth Milne as Frenchie, Brew-
ster Woodhurn as Stuffy, Howard
Peck as Joe, and Edmund Morrison
as Ralph was consistently good, al—
though the last nsmed was inclined

, to overdo his viiiiany at times. The
supporting cast was good also, espe—
‘cially the work oi Russell Peterson.
In spite oi the large number in the
cast, the play went off smoothly and
kept the interest of the audience
This production was no doubt the
most difiicult problem in direction of
any of the tour.

Alvnrd Convincing

The most iinlshed production of the
evening was undoubtedly “Nina" writ.
ten by Ruth Evans. The play itself
was unusually fine and in addition.
each member of the cast gave an ex-
cellent interpretation of his charac-
ter. The most outstanding work was
done by Frances Aivord in the part
oi Hepsihah. Her acting was convinc-
ing in that she put into it lust the
right amount of restraint and rigid
lty that the part Callzd ior. The light—
ing on Wednesday wa snot good but
was improved on Thursday and added
much to the general eiiect.

Plays All Student Productions

"Long Flannels" written and direct-
ed by Margaret Weishaar was a clev-
er play oi dormitory life, full oi wit.
ticisms and with a good deal of at-
mosphere. The cast, composed entire-
ly of women, showed no unusual tal-
ent, and an emphasis on certain words
and syllables was a hit irritating at
times. A tendency for the character
part to “take" the scene of the "dii.
ferent" girl, especially on Thursday
night, was decidedly unethical, All
'the character senter into the spirit
of the play and made the most of
the clever dialogue. Core Mac Bushy's
acting was superior to that of any
one else in the cast.

The staging of the four plays was
done entirely by members or the pro-
duction classes, and gave nearly one
hundred students an opportunity to
do creative work, There has never be
fore been, in Grinnell, 3. program of
one act plays, entered in competition,
that were written, directed acted and
staged by students. It is hoped that
iis venture will be the impetus for
more creative Work, a field in which
Grlnnell has made only slight prog-
ress.

An interesting feature in ton-lor-
row’s Des Moines Sunday iieglstcr
will be an air view oi Grinnell, which
will appear in the rotogravure sec-
tion. The picture was taken by staii
photographer George Yates from the
plane "Good News” at an altitude oi
about eight thousand feet.

Fantasy to Use
Sonata Friday

Beethoven Wark Will Ac-
company Co-ed Dance
Pageant.

A fantasy using Beethoven's moon-

light sonata will be one of the prluclc
pal features of the original damn re
vital to be presented at the high
school auditorium Friday evening,
May 3, by the department of physical
education for women. Miss Clara J.
Andersen, director of the department,
is in charge of the presentation.
' The idea of using the sonata for a
dancc fantasy is an entirely originsl
conception first worked out by Phyllis
Lehmer, ’23, for the physical eduCar
lion class in pageants and festivals.
The theme of the entire fantasy is
the interpretation oi Beethoven's
memories as he plays the sonata.

For the recital, the first two move.
ments oi the sonata will be played
by Blanche Hulsehus, in the part of
Beethoven. The ilrst movement rep-
resents the nppearance oi the fairies
of moonlight, while the second is
Beethoven's recollection of a minuet
cxecuted by a group of his friends at
a ball. The third movement depicts
Beethoven's struggle as deafness
comes upon him. interpreted in the
fantasy by a struggle between the
elves of deafness and the fairics oi
hearing in which the elves are ultl<
mately victorious,

An additional atmospheric effect
will be given the original interpreta-
tion by the use of a gauze curtain
which has been loaned the department
through the courtesy of Mr. Walsh oi
the President Theatre, Des Moines,

Tickets for the festival will go on
sale at Talbott‘s drug store Monday,
April 29, and there will be a reserved
section in addition to the general ad-
mission,

Grinnell spent it disappointing ﬂf‘
