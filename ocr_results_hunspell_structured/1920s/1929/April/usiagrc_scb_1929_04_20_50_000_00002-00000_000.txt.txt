The Great God Tradition

Friday morning at chapel ten undergraduates were giv-
en the highest award for scholastic achievement, They ‘are to
be congratulated for their ability, determination, interest, will-
rlower, and work, tor these are the ingredients which must M
mixed to produce the individual who attains Phi Beta Kappa

supremacy.

But above all are these students to be congratulated [or
something that requires all five ot the above merits in abound-
ance; something that ls spoken or in irritated groups, though
rarely mentioned in editorial columns. And that is the ability.
determination, will power, or what have you to attend classes
conducted by boring professors—to attend them and he able to
derive enough intormation out of text books (surely not out ot
the classroom) to pass an examination well.

Grinnell seems untortunate in having an aboundance of such
pedagogs. It may be due to the inadequate salaries, but only
in part, [or there are many in the teaching world today who
would welcome the opportunity to teach in collegiate circles,
were they given the chance. It seems more likely that this is
another ot the commandments of the god or Tradition that rules
over the Pioneer campus.

The protessors who may be included in such a category
are those oi the English department who laclr a (meat or even
welllchosen diction, ot the Political Science department who,
in covering the history of the course, have no time for the dis-
cussion of the politics of the day, and of the History department
who do not relate the past with the present, Douhtless thes‘e
professors know their subject, and herein may lie the ditticulty;
they are so bored with repeating the some topics year after
year that they pass this ennui on to their soporitic class.

. we offer a prayer to the god of Tradition that he re
tract [his one commandment, at leastLHuuter L, Scott.

Freedom Ha! Ha!

i ..

Grinnell college which has been considered liberal in its
views. does not sanction a free press. Every SCARLET AND
BLACK editorial is thoroughly censored by the editors who, be-
cause of pressure from the outside, have been forced to aban-
don hopes of being unhampered mouthpieces of the student body.
Articles meeting the journalistic requirement or being truth-
rul, constructive, aud or student interest cannot be published
if they depart from the narrow channels of expression estab-
lished by tradition, and tor each editorial board, by the inter
diets resulting from experlence.

The SCARLET AND BLACK is issued under five major
(abnosithe year may produce more.

1. The SCARLET AND BLACK dares not oppose the double
standard of conduct fixed for women who are recognized as
equals by men

2. It cannot propose that the dullness and even stupidity
iii some chapel and vesper programs is cause for the indiffer-
ent attendance 01 students.

3. It must retrain from indicating the mental turmoil of
a student body groping for a comprehension of religion. It can-

not attack any doctrine nor discuss the church and substitutes
for it, the philosophies learned in the classroom.‘

4. It cannot criticize the administration vigorously or copy
sistently (or a tault, An editorial upon the dining room ser-
vice which received student approval was greeted with admoni-
lion from the authorities. ’

5. It would never evaluate the personnel of the departments
according to merit nor advocate the method of medieval stu-
dents, flocking to the best teachers—William s. D. Clark.

Originality Breaks Out

"Well, anyway.
lus hound," asserts Georgianna of the “mug Flannels” east.

The [our original oneract plays to be presented for the pub-
lic this week include this remark and many other witty lines
according to the members of the play production classes who
have already witnessed the preview.

The class members have also spread the rumor that Spink-
ie's jumper causes her considerable embarrassment. Blood and
thunder flows through "Crude Oil.” Camille’s orchids are sup-
plied at an almost prohibitive cast in "Money for Orchids." Mrs.
Hillingsworth is quite properly shocked at Nina’s remarks about
the dean nf Women in "Nina."

I'd rather he a prometrodder than 2 calcu—

Originallty is being fostered in Grinnell this Week by the
production of these four one-act plays written by members or
the class in play Writing and submitted in the Steiner prize
competition—Aileen Milligan.

Prepping, Maybe Not, But—

Charlle Chaplin has defined the American idea of humor.
He made millions because he realized that Americans enjoyed

the sorrows of someone else. But Grinnell upper classmen, at

least those in Clark hall, have yet to admit this. They main-
tain, though evidence he to the contrary, that prepping prepares
the freshman to lead a hetter lite, in college or out. Perhaps
they recall the avowal of early Christians that one must tor-
ture oneself to get to heaven. Might it be an amplified state-
ment it one would suggest that a man must be tortured by up-
per classmen to he truly on the road to success.

It this is true other buildings are soon to he outclassed.
Robert Mllligan is a. certain candidate ior class presidcnt, He
was compelled to get a gold fish at 1 a, m. John Edwards will
he the next captain or the football team. Why not? He milk-
ed a cow with one hand at 2 o'clock in the morning. And so
we might elucidate our point.

Some or the upper classmen want prepping. But they are-
rl’t kidding the world by making believe that they are favoring
the prep. Justice looks through impartial eyes and tinds them
guilty of entertaining themselves at the expense of another's
selfresteen'ln Grinnell has a no-propping rule, The next ques-

tion is up to the students. Their enforcement is necessary.7
Kenneth Clayton.

GrinnelI-Carleton Track
Meet Will be Held May 3

The Grinnelva‘drleton dual track
meet, scheduled for May 4, will he
held on May 3, according to Coach
Lester Duke. The week-end will be a
busy one ior Grinnell and it was
thought best to change the date to
avoid conllict with the Notre Dame
tennis match which is scheduled on
May 4. The Grinnell high school is
holding a meeting in Grinnell on that
date also, and will probably use the
college track.
