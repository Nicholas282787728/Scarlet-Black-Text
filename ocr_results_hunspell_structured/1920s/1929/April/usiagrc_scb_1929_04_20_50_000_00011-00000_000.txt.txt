SATURDAY, ”RH 29, 1919

I Pye Bums Far, Quickly

After two hard days of hitch hik-
ing. to see pennants of old Grinnell
taking precedence in foreign ﬁelds is
a pleasure not to be snltied at, ac-
cording lO Hubert Pye, freshman
highway specialist, who has learned
how to hike without puniohs,

At the Kansas stadium be round the
name of old Grinneil more conspicu-
ously displayed than that of any oth-
er Missouri Valley institution. A blue
Creighton banner, bedraggled by the
rain, was the first iamiliar object to
meet his gaze when he dragged him—
self wcarily into the stadium. A Wash»
ington pennant in the same condition
attracted his attention n . . Oklahoma
and Drake each had a couple. But
three Scarlet and Black banners were
blazing around the rim or the bowl,

Comment of are fans also seemed
to favor the gules and sable, Pye said,
Everywhere he found the Pioneer team
given good chances to placing high.
But when the whole track was inunr
dated, with tour inches of water at
one end, it was generally conceded
that the dope might be just a triile
diluted.

Pye made an eight o’clock anoint-
ment Friday of last week with the
tederal highway going west. Aside
from rain most of the way, so that
his liits got stuck seven times be-
tween Des Moines and Omaha, and
one car that he was in lost a wheel
by sliding into a ditch, the gods smil~
ed on the faithful rooter: he reached
the stadium at Lawrence at 1:30 Sate
urday afternoon. Starting back that
evening, and hitchehiking all night, he
returned in time to see the local
burghers issue trom morning cburch.

Drake Tennis Meet
Postponed by Rain

The ﬁrst outdoor tennis match
scheduled between Grinneii college and
Drake university which was to have
been played early this last week has
been indeﬁnitely postponed because of
the recent rains. The match was orig
inallyt‘ [1);th
Griu’nelr, but later ’chin’g’
ﬁtted a switch to the Drake courts.

The records or the two teams can
hardly be used as a basis tor a study
of their comparative strengths because
the teams are not of the same size
and the schools which have been met
this year are of two distinct classes.
Grinnell has the “Four Men" team
while Drake so far this season has
only had a two nlan’representation.

Followers oi the team are awaiting
the dual, which promises to be excit-
ing, tor Drake was successful in de-
tecting the Grinnell representatives
in an early season tilt. The Pioneer
team should exhibit midseason term
which would enable them to give their
opponents a stiff battle, or perhaps re-
peat their porformance oi last year.

Players Competing in
Sport World.

Stillwater, Okla, Am 27 (Special)——
Oklahoma A. and M. college athletes
played an important part in the na
lion's sports news over the week-end.

While John Faulkner was running a
brilliant mile aramst Ray Conger at
the Kansas Relays two wrestlers, one
a graduate and the other still a stu~
dent were winning two national titles
at the A. A, U. tournament held in
New York City.

The track men also doubled the
score on Central State Teachers col-
lege and Raymond Adair established
a new college record in the hair mile
run, Although the A. and M. base-
ball team lost to the University or
Arkansas A to 0, they outliit their op-
ponents [our hits to three.

Arlie Tomlinson, who was keptoff
the varsity wrestling team all season
because of a leg injury, and George
Campbell, 1925 national champion in
the 118 pound class, now living at
Sand Springs, proved the sensation
ot the national A. A. U. tournament
according to press association dis-
patches ii-om New Yol' City.

Tomliuson won the championship in
the 147 pound class by throwing
George Hundzellls, of New York in
10 minutes and 41 seconds in the ﬁnal
round, thus winning each of his four
matches in the tournament by falls.

Campbells showing was just as brile
liant as he went to the ﬁnal round
in each of two weights, 118 pound and
125 pound. After losing a gruelling
match in the ﬁnals or the 118 pound
class to Thomas McCrary of Cornell
college, Iowa, Campbell came back and
defeated Mac Itarport at Boston tor
the championship or me 126 pound
class.

While John Faulkner couldn'tbeat
the famous Ray Conger at the Kansas
Relays, he did stay with him through-
out the race and lost by a scant throc
yards when Conger staged one or his
famous ﬁnishes, coming from behind
in the last 100 yards. Conger took
the lead at the outset and held the lead
ior three laps with Faulkner at his
heels. oh the hack stretch ol the

The winning time was 4:252, cone
sitlel'ed tast in the taco or the slow
condition of the track and the cold
raw wind which was blowing. Faulkr
llel"s coach, Roy w. Kenny, estimates
that Faulkner was tour lentils of a
second behind the winner.

While Faulkner was at the Kansas
Relays, the track team was winning
11 ﬁrsts to swamp Central State
Teachers college and Adair was break-
ing the college record in the hall
mile, a mark formerly held by Faulk-
ner. Adair ran the race in 1:585,
three tenths of a second faster than
the mark set last year in the Oklar
homa University dual meet. Adair-s
performance was all the more remark-
able in view of the tact that the track
was a little slow and that he was not
pushed at the ﬁnish.

The baseball team won two out ot
three games played on its first road
trip, winning from Tulsa University
audspiitting a two contest series with
the University ot Arkansas.
