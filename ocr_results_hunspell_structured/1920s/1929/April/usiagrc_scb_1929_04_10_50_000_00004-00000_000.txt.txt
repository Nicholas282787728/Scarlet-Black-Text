Ll TIER TD Till-I HDI'I‘DIL
To The Editor-
Scarlet and Black
Deill‘ Sir:

in the last SCARLET AND BLACK
an editorial appeared seriously cone
damning the service and general at~
titude of the waiters and kitchen help
at the men's dormitories All that
has been said may well be true and
is certainly. as the editorial stated, a,
disgrace to Grinnoll~but there are
two sides to every story.

Suppose that in the Waldorf As-
toria, or the Ritz Carleton where the
menus are the delectation oi ehicnres
and the service not only flawless,
hut even artistic so that the whole
proc ot scr rig a meal becomes a
thing about which to write sonnets;
just suppose that in this atmosphere
and in these surroundings the diners
poured entice and cocoa copiously on
the table coverings, threw the bread
from one to another to say nothing of
throwing it at one another, placed hut-
ter and jelly covered knives and otllr
er iood covered instruments at the
epicurenn pursuit on the table cloths,
stacked the dishes. put sugar in the
drinking water, or did any one of the
numerous other things that seem at
present necessary attributes of a
Grinneil dining room (Note: Grinnell
tradition No. 37628937524).

beauty of the service and the excel-
leilcy of the food would go for naught!
Why clln't we do as much as is
in our power to do toward making
the eating conditions at Grim-tell more
pleasant? The waiters only reflect in
their serum; the altitude of these
whom they serve—ii we want better
service we will have to act as though
We not only expect it, but also as
though we know how to appreciate it.
when we get it- Let's make the Grin-
nell dining room as pleasant a place
to eat in as we can—we can itt least
eliminate the annoyance of filthy
table cloths portraying plainly the
past week's menus and attesting 01)-
only to the lack of care of those who
Ate there.
Sincerely,
Edward Tyler.
