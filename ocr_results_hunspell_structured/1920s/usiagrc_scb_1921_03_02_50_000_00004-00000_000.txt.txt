‘LNl New Type Li‘utlei'

In chapel Monday Dr. Evans spoke
at the need for trained leadership.
“A new type ot christian leader is
being called ior," he said, alter telling
ol the evident need on the the Pa-
citic coast for immediate leeonstruc-
tion. The great outstanding task
is that of unification it is not an
easy task. The Christian leader will
have for his task a part of the great
remaking or the world, which will
deter-mine the set of the next three
hundred years. The world mrrst be
re made in the terms of Jesus Christ
The new leader is iii the making in
the college 01' today. He must be
dominated by moral passion, an in,
tel-preter- or the past but Witlhlils
[ace toward the future. He wrll work
for the redemption of society. through
the salvation of the individual, so that
through him life may he made richer
here and now. He will he an edumr
tar, to i'eedncate and take care of the
new generation, giving it a point or
view which will function better than
that of today. The Christian leader
must have a sense of the immediacy
of the task of bettering life right here
and now.”
