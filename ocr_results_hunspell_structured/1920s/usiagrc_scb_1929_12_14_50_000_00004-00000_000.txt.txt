Direction is Strong

Too much can hardly be said for
the direction by Sara Sherman Fry-
or. which through many weeks of
preparation. has welded this play in-
to its final unified power. Without
concentrated effort and efficiency
on her part. and the part of William
Pryor. stage manager, his assistants.
and the workshop directors. the
production of the play would have
been impossible.

“Suppressed Desires" a Freudian
comedy by Susan Glaspell and
George Cram Cook, is unfortunate in
having been presented at the same
time as a'Eugene O'Neill drama. al-
though one appreciates its alleviating
farcical qualities. In its much Small~

much a success as Emperor Jones—

On the south side of town a build-

two groups. one meeting on Monday

Wednesday nights. Games are play-

joyed. The boys are given the use
of the college swimming pool

Sam's Club actually takes the place
of a Y. M. C. A. for the boys. Many
of the-boys have not other amuse-
