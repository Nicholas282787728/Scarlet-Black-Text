Records Show Only Three Schools
Have Clear Slate Over Pioneers

Only three teams have triumphed
over the Grinnell college gridiron
outfit in 41 years of football with-
out tasting defeat from the Pioneers
in return, according to the records on
file in the athletic office. Prior to
this year's season, Creighton came
on this list, but a 12 to ll victory on
Thanksgiving day marked them off
the outfit. Those who still hold
clear records over the Pioneers are
the Kansas Aggies, Dubuque unlver<
sity and Wisconsin.

During the 41 years Grinnell has
played a total of 259 games, winning
135, losing 110 and tying 14. Most
of the teams over which Crinnell has
not triumphed, have played but few
games with the college. The two de-
feats at the hands of the Kansas
aggies came in 1921 and 1923. Du-
buque university has played only one
game with Crinnell, winning, 13 to o,
in 1913.

Wisconsin tackled Grinnell‘

'four times and was victorious on
each occasion. The Pioneers have
played one game with Grinnell high
school, going to a o to 0 tie back in
1902.

Although Grinnell has played some
of the outstanding teams of the midr
west. it has managed to take a share
of the games. Minnesota holds a
majority over the Pioneers with
eleven victories, but Crinnell has
trimmed the Gophers three times and
tied them twice, Iowa university
has been defeated five times, won
19 games and been tied once. Ne-
braska, now one of the leading foot»

tasted the sting Ci defeat twice.
The record is not outstanding, but

a small college continually playing
universities and larger schools.
