Three weeks hence one will hear
the snoring of slumbering freshmen
echoing from dormitory club rooms to
upper classmen and alumni that spells
“Hv0~MsE~C~OerIsN»G."

' Grinnell's Homecoming will take
place Saturday, October 22, and will be
featured by the football game with
Drake, the last game on the home field
this season. Drake and Ames have al-
ternatcd as homecoming attractions
for a number of years, and it is hoped
by those in charge that in spite of the
impending change in the membership
-of the Valley conterence that this or-
rangement will still be continued as
these three institutions are natural
rivals and their student bodies and
alumni are bétter acquainted with each
other than is the case with most other
colleges in Iowa or the Valley conier-
ence.

Chapman to Speak _.
In Chapel Tuesday

Representative to Grinnell—In—
China Will Discuss Work In
Teal-low School.

When J. Forrest Chapman, G n-
nell's representative to Grinnclleine
China, returns to the campus next
Tuesday. the occasion should be for
Grinnellians one of full realization of
the significance of the work that is
being carried on in the schools of
Techow, the committee reports.

Chapman was graduated frnm Grin-
nell in 1524, and went directly to
China, where lie completed a two year
period as instructor in the Porter Mid-
dle school, a coworker of Harold S.
Matthews. His term in China. was one
of especial anxiety and difficulty due
to the disrupted condition of the
country, yet Grinnell-iu-Chlnn matin-
mined through the hardships its stand
ards of efficiency and service. Chap-
man will speak in chapel on Tuesday,
instead of Monday as was previously
annuunmd, and Will tell of the work of
Gri‘nneli—in-China as a feature of the
Pioneer Chest drive.

Was Student Loader.

While in Grinuell Chapman made an
outstanding record as a student lead-
or. He was a member of the Lantern,
Sigma Delta Chi, student council,
SCARLET AND BLACK, Malteascr,
and served as editor-in chief of the Cy-
clone.

Techow, the city in which Grinnell»
in-China is located, is only twenty
miles from the northern border oi the
province of Shantung. The Porter and
Wyckoff schools are pioneering in the
field of education in that part of
China, for the'Porter school is the
only unior and senior high school in
tbirt)’»two counties whose population
totals more than 5,000,000. Most oi
the Chinese schools in Techow are oi
an elementary kind, with no appre-
ciable instruction offered. ‘

Students To Talk )[Dllillly.

Chapel on Monday will be occupied
with talks by the "v" presidents. and
and addr s by Mr. Wang Yuan—H, n.
Crinnell- in - China's . rcpr cntative
here in Grinnell this year, Mr. Wang
graduated from Porter Middle school
in 1011, and from the North China Lin-
ion college in 1915, Until this year he
has been the head of the science de-
pnrtment in Porter Middle school, and
throughout his career has been prom-
inent in North China educational cir-
cles.

Freshman-Sophomore Scrap Date
Set For Next Wednesday Morning

Freshman Field will be the scene of
great activity next Wednesday mul‘nr
ing at six o’clock when the freshmen
meet the sophomores in their annual
class scrap

A Senate committee, composed oi
Ted Lovejoy as chairman and Emer—
son Scuill and John ycnswold, met
Thursday to make several slight media
ucations in the rules. The contest.
howcvcr, Will be essentially thc same
as it has been in past years.

"l‘lie tierup will actually begin Tues»
day night at nine o'clock when all
sophomores except football men are
required to leave the buildings and
Jude somewhere in the vicinity of the
campus. Ally sophomores found in
the dormitories will be disqualiﬁed.
Freshmen are to set out in pursuit oi
their enemies at 0:30. For the next
ﬁve hours, each side will eliminate
their oponcnts by tying them and
handing their names to one oi the
three junior sponsors who will be
chosen from the junior class.

Between 2:30 and six o’clock, a truce
will be declared. At the end of this
period, men from both classes will be
put together in a 25-foot square.
Freshmen will then have twenty min—
utes in which to tie all of tho sophs
hand and foot, and then the second

year men will have a minute and a
hall to work tbcmsclves loose. If one
soph succeeds in 21 mg to his feet, his
class wms the struggle.

No one Will he allowed in the ring
except participants in the scrap. Spear
iators will be kept ten ieet from the
ring in order to eliminate all possi-
bility or their lending aid to either
side. The use of cars will be prohib-
ited during the preliminary round dur-
ing the night, and all men will be re-
quired to wear soft solcd shoes during
the scrap proper.

Seniors will be affiliated with the
sophomores, and the juniors with the
freshmen, although neither of the up-
per classes will be allowed to aid mas
torially either side. Neither side will
have any sort of identiﬁcation in the
ring. No referee has yet been chosen.
hilt Lester Duke, football coach and
director of physical education will
probably act in this capacity.

Although the sophomores of past
years have always been outnumbered.
they have usually won because oi the
rule that it is necessary for only one
man to become discntansled. The
sophs won last year after a long argu~
meat as to whether any one man had
arisen to his feet.

Frosh Masticatory Machines Are

Too Slow For

if the famous old Scotch maxim,
“Haste makes waste," is at all true,
we are willing to not our grandmotbr
er's galoslics that there has been an
immense economy in the quadrangle
dining-room since the arrival of the
freshman class. The upper class-
mcn were simply astounded to hear
that the props have been “just starv»
ing" because of insufficient time to de-
your and guzzle their calories. In
such a highrgeared civilization as the
present, it is to he expected that the
digestive organs should be re-urgan-
izcd to correspond with other high-
spced machines. And what is the sur-
prising teaiurc is that the alert and
staunchly modern faculty should lis-
ten to these plans for slower service
in the diningrroomr—not only listen to
them. but even heed Lhcm.

A few ingenious persons have slig-
gested divers methods for passing the
time between courses profitably. For
instance, a bridge tournament might
be well under way bctween the time
of the removal of the lftst salad plate,
and the arrival of the first piece of

 

Proper Maintenance
,

pic. According to Hoylc — or is it
Worklithe average round of bridge
should take no longer than eight min-
utes, if scientifically played. At this
rate, at least four hands could be fin-
ished each meal, and by the end of
the table assignment, the champion
for each table could he definitely
agreed upon. of Cnul‘se this would
he only an upper class contest, for
the freshmen would be busily engaged
with the problem of finishing their
vitamins. .

Another suggestion for the disposal
of this surplus time, is the possible
adoption of what might be termed a
correspondence hour. Each girl would
come to meals fully equipped to write
all: least one, and possibly two, letters.
More than one uppcrclassmen would
take advantage of this correspondence
course.

Now far be it from us to desire to
injure the digestion of the freshman
girls, but we fear that this belated
system of service may gradually grow
into it tradition. If so, heaven help
the class of '31.
