owing to the fact that the
greater part of the canvassing for
the Pioneer chest in the quad—
rangle and in three of the men's
dormitories remahred to be done
at noon today, the campaign to
ritlse the desired quota will be
continued until Monday night.
This announcement. was made this
morning by the joint committee
of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. w. C. A.
in charge of the cavnss, composed
of Blanche iiulsehus, Elizabeth
Cook, Lewis Troycr and Walwl-
Socor.

If early reports from the three
buildings in which some canvassing
has been done are any indication of
'what the two Christian associations
may expect to raise for the Pioneer
chest, the success of the project for
this year seems assured. At a
breakfast this morning of some or
the representatives in charge of the
dormitory solicitation, the reports
given indicated unusual interest in
the Chest. The Quadrangle had made
no report up to noon today, but an
intensive canvass was being made of
the cottages today.

Campaign Opens Thursday

The campaign was opened Thurs-
day morning in chapel, when the
Rev. W. C. Fairficld. Home secretary
of the American Board of Missions.
mlkcd on "What China Needs" and
the relation of the Christian associa—
tions on the campus to those needs.

”When I got to China, I realized
that civilization and religion were
not the same thing," declared Rever-
end Fairficld. “China has plenty of
religions, but because they offer no
philosophy of life which brings order
out of chaos, they have ceased to be
a progressive influence in Chinese
life.” "

“We have come realize two
things about China: that students
need that philosophy of life which
they do not have—one which gives
life significance and orderiand that
the Christian religion is giving this
best: second, our years

Forensic Meets Wednesday
in Smith Hall Club Room

Grinnell Forensic held its regular
semi-monthly meeting last Wednes-
day evening. After dinner in the
men's dining room, the business ses-
sion and discussion of the evening
were held in Smith hall clubroom.

Pioneers Point
for Next, Game

Start Hard Sessions Monday
for Tutor Encounter
Next Friday

Two days of practice this week
were all that the Grinnell college
gridmen experienced, and these were
not strenuous sessions. The varsity
reserves, however, received only one
day of rest, getting their work
against the freshman eleven on the
other afternoons. The two days
which the regulars spent on the
gridiron were devoted chieﬂy to
dummy scrimmage and practice'on
passing formations.

Coach Watt will start drilling his
men in earnest next week for the
Teachers college contest which is
scheduled for Friday, Nov. 8. He is
conﬁdent that if his men show the
brand of football they did against
Drake they will take the game with
little trouble.

Tie Teachers Last Year.

Grinnell fans remember only too
well the o to 0 tie with Teachers in
1928 when the Pioneers were doped
to come away with an easy victory.
The game was played just following
the spectacular victory over Mara
quette. This year it follows on the
heels of a great showing at Des
Moines but the mentors are not look-
ing for any drop in the game played
by the Scarlet and Black eleven.

The fact that the aerial attack
failed to show against the Bulldogs
is not causing Coach Watt any great
worry, since his team opened up
with a powerful series of offstackle
drives which should prove just as ef-
fective.

Captain Rose and Bichey are al-
ready back in shape for grueling
play and were out for practice
Thursday. Thomas and Humphrey,
who suffered broken ribs against

China? is Fighting Against Great Odds
lio Achieve Progress, Slates Fairfieltl

“The Christian school system and
schools such as Gl'lllnellslnschlllzl are
producing the men and women who
have been callcd to leadership in
China today," the Rcv. Mr. w. C.
Faii'field declared in an address ho-
fore members of the Y. W. C. A., Y.
M. c. A., and faculty Thursday eve»
nirrg in A. R. H. auditorium. Mr.
Fair-field is Honrc Secretary of the
American Board of Missions and has
served for several years in the miS»
sion fields of China. “China's Pres
errt Problems" was his subject.

China today is trying to do three
things, Mr. Fairficld said. She is try-
mg to substitute democracy for a
four thousand year old military
despotism, to fre herself of the
handicaps of ineff‘ ient Manchu rule,
and to become a modern nation. she
is trying to do all these things at
once and isn't able to; China today
can't cooperate.

Finance on Personal Basis.

The replacement of personal re-
sponsibility with democratic patriot-
ism is one of the biggest problems
the leaders are facing, the speaker
pointed out. For four thousand years
this immediate personal relationship,
loyalty to the man above, culminat—
ing in the Emperor who, in turn, was
responsible to God, has existed and
become firmly ingrained in the lives
of_the people. To replace it with
patriotic citizenship in the minds and
hearts of four hundred million peo-
ple is a task which will take many
years.

“The administration of finances
was formerly on a personal basis,
and the clever man was the one who
could provide enough revenue for

Functions.

Plans for the various fall house
parties, although not very complete,
have been formulated and definite
announcements will be made in the
near future. As has been the cus~
tom in past years, several of the
house parties will be held on the
same date.

Cottages II and In; and Iv and v
are planning to hold their parties
jointly. Two and Three will have
theirs November 16 in the form of
a fun»house at a country fair in the
Women's gym. The orchestra has
not been announced yet.

Cottages Four and Five also are
holding their party together, sl-
thongh no definite plans have been
made, other than setting the date for
January 13.

Mears has planned an elaborate
affair in the form of a Chinatown
ball, November 16 with the Blue
Melodians furnishing the music. Cen—
tral has announced the date of their
party for Nov. 16 also.

definite plans for its affair.

those above him, keep those below
from grumbling at the amount ho
cxtortcd and in addition keep a
goodly sum for llimsclt,” said Mr.
Fairlield. "The problem here i to
replace this system with tho f.cd
budgct and fixed salary."

The Chinese law courts have no
elaborate codcs of law; they sock to
administer justice, not law, and bring
personal wisdom and cxpcricncc to
bear in the decisions. Today formal
codes of law are being introduced.

Hove Medieval Fcndul System.

Mr. Foirfield pointed out that
there is naturally an unwillingness
to transfer the personal power of
this age-old feudal system to the
realm of trusteesbip. As in all
feudal systems, personal ambition
has always been a big difficulty, Mr.
Fairneld said. The war lords and
feudal barons are ranged against the
civil govemment. ,

Along with the foreign concession
and extra territoriality rights there
are hold-overs from the inefficient
Manchu dynasty of the nineteenth
century. Medieval methods of agrir
culture are still in use. The hills
are deforested, with the consequent
result of flood and famine. The min-
ing industry has not been developed.
The seven thousand miles
of railroad must be increased and rev
paired before Chinh can make any
claims of being a modern nation. Fif-
ty million dollars will be necessary
just for the repair of the existing
railroad system, which has been
damaged by the civil wars of tbclsst
four years, Mr. Fairfiold declared.

“China has practically no ship-

Osgood, Curator at Field
Museum, Will be Here
December Third.

Wilfred Henry Osgood, prominent
zoologist and curator in the Field
Museum, will speak here December
third, Professor E. B. T. Spencer has
announced. The exact subject has
not been decided upon, but it will
have to do with travel, and presum-
ably a zoological aspect thereof.

Mr. Osgood holds his bachelor's
degree from Leland Stanford univ—
ersity, and his doctor’s from Chicago.
For ten years he was employed
the department of agriculture.
was a biological investigator
Alaska.

Since 1909 Dr. Osgood has worked
in the Field museum in Chicago, and
is now curator of zoology there. He
has been a member of expeditions in
Alaska, Canada, and various parts of
the United States and South Am-
erica. He has spent two years

of British and American scientiﬁc
societies, Dr. Osgood has been pre—
sident of the American Society of
Mammologists, and is a member of
the biological division of the Nation—
al Research council. He is the au~

Statistics Show Mimy College Men
Work for Part or All of Expenses

The romantic notion of the col-
lege student as an irresponsible
youth who spends his time in d‘ .
playing the latest fads in "col-
legiate” clothing and in serenading
the co-cds is punctured somewhat by
statistics on student employment at
Grinnell college made public by
Shelton L. Boatty, dean of men.
More than ﬁftyetwo per cent of the
men students are regularly employ-
ed. many of them earning their en-
tire college expenses.

Waiting on tables is the most
popular job for college men, since it
interferes least with other activities.
Many students, however, are employ

 

 

ed in caring for the tennis courts,
athletic fields, and College buildings.
others do secretarial work or serve
as laboratory assistants.

Work done otf the campus varies
from factory labor to preaching and
directing orchestras. Several stu-
dents work in restaurants. while
others are salesmen in local stores.
One is a barber, another gives music
lessons, and another pays his entire
college expenses by contract paint—
ing. Several of the journalism stu—
dents earn money as correspondents
for city newspapers and press as—
sociatlons.

Young Russian is First to
Perform on College

Music Course.

Vladimir Horowitz, the young Rus-
sian pianist whose appearance at
Grinnell on November 26 will open
the concert series, is outstanding
among the younger musicians of to-
day. Although only 24, Horowitz
has made two successful American
tours in addition to his European
concerts which began in 1924. Mus-
ical critics of New York, Boston, and
Chicago, as well as the critics of
Paris and Berlin, have characterized
his playing as displaying both
expert technique and unusual inter-
pretative power.

Horowitz was born in Kieff of a
well—to-do family. He studied in the
Conservatory of Kicff, graduating at
the age of 17 with highest honors.
He spent three years in giving con-
certs in Russia and then made a tour
of the largest cities of Europe. His
ﬁrst American appearance, in Jan-
uary of 1928, was with the New
York Philharmonic Orchestra. Since
that time, he has played with the
New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis.
Cincinnati, Chicago, and Boston
Symphony Orchestras, and has also
given many recitals without orch—
estra as he will do in Grinnell.

Players Plan
Production of

O’Neill Drama

National Collegiate Players
to Give ‘Emperor Jones’

on December 6.

Production is Short

Will Give Gldspell’s ‘Suppressed
Desires' on Same Night as
Curtain Raiser.

“Emperor Jones" by Eugene
O’Neill, will be given December sixth
at the Colonial theatre, produced
under the auspices of Pi Epsilon
Delta chapter of the National Col—
lcgiatc Players. The play is the ﬁrst
long drama written by O'Neill and
was produced for the first time by
the provincetown Players in Mac-
Dougal's Alley in New York. The
title role was originated by a colored
man, Charles Gilpin, who played ﬁrst
in Greenwich Village, then on Broad-
way and finally toured the country.
Play is Short

Because the play is not of usual
length, a curtain raiser will be given
preceding it that evening. "Sup-
pressed Desires" by Susan Glaspell
and George Cram Cook, has been
chosen because it is considered the
best one act comedy written by Am-
erican authors, both of whom are
Iowans. This play also was one of
the original Pr'ovincetown plays and
will make the entertainment a re-
vival of the work of the Province-
town Players.

In Eight Scenes

“Emperor Jones" is in eight
scenes, all laid on an unknown island
of the West Indies, inhabited by un-
civilized natives. The' principal
character, the emperor, which will be
taken by Clifton Lamb, is an erst-
while Pullman porter who has been
arrested for murder and put ,into
jail. He has killed a guard and
made his escape to the island where
he has succeeded in having himself
made emperor. The time has come
when the natives have realized his
game and have turned against him.
The play deals with his escape
through the forest. The part of
Smithcrs, a cockney trader which
will be taken by Richard Phillips, is
also an important one.

Tryrouts for the remaining parts
are being held daily in Room 11
ARI-I. There is a great deal of
pantomine in the play and many
chances for good acting.

Harriers Meet
Parsons Today

Coach Carroll Swearcngcn took his
Pioneer cross—country squad this
morning to Parsons College at Fair—
field, where they met the Parsons
harriers this afternoon. Led by Cap—
tain Walter Secor, the team was
seeking to keep its slate clean by
annexing its third win of the season.
Coe and Penn having been defeated
previously.

Six men are being taken by Coach
Swearcngen. They are: Captain Se»
cor, Mcllrath, Pye, McCandlcss,
Murphy and McKenzi . Parsons has
a strong team this season and the
distance run this afternoon was dop-
ed to be a difficult one for Crinnell
to win.

The local barriers will next meet
the State Teachers as an added at-
traction at the football game next
Friday. This is expected to be an
exceedingly close encounter. as the
Teachers defeated Grinnell last year.
while the Pioneers are undefeated
this season, to date. Carlton. will
likely bring its cross-country team
down on November is, when the
Carls and Grinnell clash on the grid-
iron.
