Mr, H, E. Hulbcrt spokc before c
large audience at the Methodist
church Sunday morning on the sulr
jcct, “The Eiiing Line of the Church."

\lr. Hulhert opened his remarks
w ii an explanation or the place
which Korea occupies gocgrcphically
and the signiiicont comparison with
the geographic position of Palestine
and Belgium. He stated that Korea
has nn opportunity to become the
leader at Christianity» in the eastern
world.

Mr. Hulhcrt also spoke of the gen—
uineness or the Korean Christian be-
liel. They not only accept the theory
ol Christianity and base their belief
on the Bible, but 'they practice in ev-
ery day lite therteztchings of Chris-
tianity. So genuine is their belief
that are willing to stand up against
all persecution. Mr. Hulhert gave in-
teresting illustrations of his points
