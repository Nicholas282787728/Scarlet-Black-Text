’l‘lIE STD—DEN" COUNCIL.

Tire [act that blaclt headlines proclaim to the world
that the “Student Council clashes with the Faculty at
Gl‘lunell” is no more of a sign of dissension than is the
story itself a true account or actual circumstanccs. An
enthusiastic booster once presided over a political meet»
ing in honor of William McKinley, who was stumping for

Humid Colbert,
iiligll lulu-unis.

the presidency. He introduced Mr. Mci; icy as the
“next president or the United states." Mr. McKinley rer
plied, “This man is a bettcr Republican than a Prophet."
So ill this case the misguided soul of an enterprising
journalist led his discretion astray.

Tire incts oi tlle case are that the students do have
a strident form of government and they also have a. co»
operative form or government, Under the reorganization
lilon of last year the student Council becomes tlic local
point for all matters pertaining to the student body. It
is for the promotion of mutual understanding among
campus organizations. the Women's League and tho
Council of House Chairmen, it is created for the ill-or
motion ill every way possible or the best illtcrcst oi Grin-
uell college. In fact the Student Council really does
liinction independently on all questions involving the
student. us a whole or any organization. However, when
a matter comes up that involves the other branches of the
institution, cooperative government is put into elfect.

in the some manner that the Student Council is the
governmental organ of the students, just so is the admin-
istrative committee the instrument of the administration
and the faculty committee is the instrument of the. lac-
ulty. Thus there is n triology. While each hody is a
law unto itself when dealing with one group it repre»
sciits, no single rmit can dominate the situation when a
question affecting the whole college arises.

When a question of Victory Day arises, it must be
passed by the Strident Council as representative of :1
student rvisli. However, Victory day affects the (acuity
and the administration. Hence each or these bodies in
turn must pass on it. Here is where cooperation in its
truest sense of the Word is possible. Co—opei‘ation ile-
lwccu the three governmental liodies tor the riphuilding
of Grinnell is possible; not only possible, but is actually
hciug done.

Tile student Council is entirely a strident organiza—
tion. It is final ill dealing with matters pertaining to
the student body. In that respect Griuuell does have stur
dent government. On the other hand when the student
council must meet with the other two governmental
heads, there is a co-opcrative government. Given the
hruper consideration and mature thorigiit that the stir»
dcnts are capable oi, the Strident Council hopes to make
its position clear in relation to the students primarily
and to the college as a, whole.

Dear Sii.

It's funny to mo how time will
change people's attitudes, their opin-

their activi es. It will soon he four
weeks since there was again started

rector was working for the organiztc
tion and uniiorming oi the highest
