Ml's. Flanagan spoke on "Friend-
ship” at prayers sunday morning.
“TWO great principles that we often
tor-get in making our triendships are:
that we should have the adventure
Spirit, regarding every acquaintance
as a. Potential friend; and that we
should use our intnigence in culti—
vating a great, catholic tolerance tor
our friends”, she said. Nellie Han-
son played a pleasing piano solo,

Possibly the saying, "the good die
young" originated from observing
some or the old-timers.
