THE smokers of this age are the most
independent ever known. Accepting
no hearsay, they have smoked out the
facts. They have learned that the
choicest Turkish and Domestic to.
baccos grown are rolled into Camels,
dial here is the incomparable blend-
ing for goodness, that Camels simply
never tire the taste.

Camel is the cigarette that never
fails to please the modern age. Re-
gardlzss oi how often you want the
comfort of a smoke, of how steadily
you light one after another, Camcl

will never fail you, never give you
any but the ﬁnest thrill oi smoking
plcasoro. This is why Camcl’s popu—
larity, by far the largest in the modern
world, keeps overwhelmingly in the
lead. As modern taste becomes more
insistent upon choice robaccos, in-
creasing millions discover Camel’s in.
comparable mildness, smoothness and
mellowness.

If you want the cigarette that’s
good to live with iron. morn ro mid-
night, the one that is the choice of the
modern age, "Hm demel!”
