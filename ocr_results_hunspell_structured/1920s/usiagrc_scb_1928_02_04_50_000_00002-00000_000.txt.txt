l )IONOTONY.

Too pinch of any thing is enough. it can be con-
Ceived that even beauty could grow so common as to be
tiresome. iioriotony has caused more drunkeness than
thirst. more gambling than avarice and perhaps more sui-
cides than despai Monotony is destroying. Tithe prep-
ping. for example.

At the start of the school year prepping had a dis-
tinct place. No broad mind will deny that there are
freshmen iu the world who need discipline and that mea-
sures should be taken to retard their enthusiasm now
and then. This responsibility has been assumed by up;
perclassmen. in the absence of any better agency. and
rightly so. Upperclassmen are closer to the lives of
freshmen than anyone else. liost upper-classmcn will
agree that their experience in prepping was very help-
ful. But only up a certain point.

From the beginning of the second semester. if not
sooner. prepping grows monotonous. It becomes a (tour
Venient instrument for the use of lazy \Ipperclassmen.
it is an opportunity for them to get their small jobs done
at the expense or a weaker group. The time of the first
year men, instead of being their own, is the property of
the very ones who. of all the student body, are least in
need of it. Upperclussmen. due to their previous inden-
ture. are able to adjust: themselves much better than the
ones who have not had 'the benefit of a year or more
experience in college. It seems that the helpful thing
to do would be to allow freshmen the use of their own
time.

As pointed out before. it is not our policy to advocate
the abolition of prepping, even after the period in which
its greatest benefits come has passed. One or two fresh-
men might need the help of a friendly paddle even after
the first semester. To subject a freshman to a ‘form of
slavery is_ebominahle. The first semester should afford
enough time to straighten out defects in the iresbman‘s
character. From then on it can he understood that he
is still a freshman and that any display of unruliness

iod of usefulness tor prepping hits passed and that men
in! servitude is degrading. We would advocate (lint. the
upperclnss men retain their prepping authority, but that
they refrain as much as possible from asking the fresh-
men to do these menial tasks the rest of the year.

BAD ACTORS.

Stuart P. Sherman has written an essay called "0n
Falling in Love" which closely follows the thought or an
article in the December issue of Harper's by Charles A,
Bennett entitled “The Cult of the Seumy Side," Slrcrmau
1 ~ rts that the people who appear the most charming,
the ones who are always at their best. appear really so
because they are tlle best actors. The world is a stage
upon which they must play their part. and lite is to he
dcted so that others may see their best side, The reason
people (fill out of love is that they cease acting. for the
best lovers are the most able to conceal their more
coarse. less polished. natures. It is quite conceivahle
that in time people may succeed in acting a part so well
that it will become all essential part of their natures.

it is also true that the reason the barbaric side of
people creeps out over their more ideal side is that they
cease to act their parts. Lovers always try to pllt their
best foot forward. for they want to be ilhle to keep their
mate‘s affection. But if they neglect their makeup and
forget their cues. they fall apart and love dies. In just
this way the mun who hates to go to the party with his
wife but acts his best when he gets there. is playing up to
his part.

in gill cases when the actors cease to he at their best.
their relapse is tlue to the fact that they become lazy and
refuse to make the effort to live up to their lines. Lazi-
ucss covers a multitude of sins and it surely accounts for
a great shilre of the rifts between married people. A
Week or a month at solitude spent away from the confine
ing influences of close family life enables either partner
in the marriage to forget. his part for a while and act in
whatever way he chooses. This is why the companionr
ate marriage and the “sabbatical year" are so popular.
acting what

When we have reasoned out that is

keeps us at our best. we see why the philosophy of the"

“seam side" has become so prevalent among young peo—
ple. Such a belief is immensely flattering to bad actors.
Those who are too lazy to act the part and who tail to

become aware of their best natures. retreat to thc pliilW

csophy or the “seamy side" and console themselves by
crying . "Sour grapes, the strenuous side isn’t the real
side anyway!"

VAGABON'DAGE.

A practice has grown up at Harvard which Seems
quite adaptable to our‘own college. it is called "vagee
bondage" and consists In allowing students to roam from
one class to another without. the necessity of enrolling
in the course visited. A student who desires to hear the
lecture of a certain professor. enters his class and sits
with the rest; be is never asked for the material gained.
and never takes the examinations.

The advantages of such a practice are obvious, The
Student's gain is of course the most important of these.
Undoubtedly- there are many who would value an oppor-
tunity to visit certain classes merely for the information
anti thought they receive Another advantage is that
professors would feel obliged to improve their lectures to
hold the attention of their visitors. They would have
another incentive to speak at their best and to the point.
in some cases this might be a very material improvement.

A third advantage in vagahondage is that the stur
dents themselves will show more interest in their school
Work. It would afford them an opportunity to acquaint
themselves with the course and might enable them to
decide whether the subject was of interest to them or
not. The exact nature of many studies is not apparent
until the classes have been/attended.

A general understanding that vagabondage is per-
missable in Grinneil would he the means whereby many
students avail themselves of a chance for extra know-

Track Schedule Is
Changed to Include
Dual With Carleton

The Pioneer track schedulc has
been changed to include a dual meet
with Carleton at Northfield May 5
instead 01 one with Washington uni~
verslt'y previously arranged for that
date. The muddled affairs in the
Missouri Valley made this change pos—
sible.

The Carleton track prospects are
said to be the best in years. The
squad includes a sprinter and hurdler
who runs the century in ten seconds
and high sticks in close to fifteen:
and two middle-distance men who run
the half-mile under two minutes and
the mile in about 4:30.

The local chances for a wellrbal»
anced track team are also the best
in years. The team includes capable
performers in most events as well as
national contenders in some. Laird.

rt javelin thrower. McKee, a quarter—
milel‘, and Long and Taylor. hurdlers.
are strong in their events while Phil-
lips. a middle»distance rnan. Sharn-
berg. a 440 marl and sprinter. and
Pelletier. sprinter. are sophomores
who may become stars before the year
is over.

The first time trials were held this
afternoon.
