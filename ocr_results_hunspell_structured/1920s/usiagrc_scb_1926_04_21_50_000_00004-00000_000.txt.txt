Valentino will be seen at the Strand
Theatre, Friday and Saturday Will
present the still for the ﬁrst time in
the role of (’1 Russian. In View of the
popularity which he has given to ro—
mantic La‘tiu types it will be interest.-
ing to see if he will raise the Slav
to the same public esteem.

“The Eagle” is said to be a distinct
departure for Valentino in other rer
spects also. The story has more ac-
tion and also more comedy than any
other in which he has appeared. The
star will be seen first as a handsome
Cossack lieutenant, then later as a
swift, mysterious, adventurous bandit,
whose exploits thrill all Russia. (It
is from this that character derives the
name of the Eagle). For a while he
masquerades as a French, tutor in or-
der to enter the home or his mortal
enemy.

“The Eagle” is the first of the star»
ies of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's
greatest author. to reach the screen.
The photoplay was Written by Hans
Kruly, who wrote "Passion," "Decep-
tlon," "Her Sister from Paris" and
many other notable successes.

Vilma. Bulky ,a. Striking blunde, who
was recently brought to America. by
Samuel Goldwyn, plays Opposite the
star. Louise Dresser, stage star tor
many years, has a featured role as the

Czariun.
Clarence Brown, whose rise has

been meteor 'ke, directed the pic-
ture, and is said to have done an un-
usually good job, Brown directed
“The Goose Woman.” “The Acquittztl,”
"Smoulderiug Fires” and other enter—
taining pictures.

is lining tried by a prolcssor at McGill

ance is not required.
