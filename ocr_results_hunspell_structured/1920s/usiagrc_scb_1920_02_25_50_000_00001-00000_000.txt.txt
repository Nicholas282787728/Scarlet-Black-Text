Ancient Spanish ,
Book Received ‘,
From Mexico

A Spanish book which was printedi
in the City oi Mexico in 1670 was rc-’l
‘ceived last week by Professor Carolinol
Sheldon tronr Harry Hopkins, '10.

The book was gii on him by a priest
while on Red Cross rcliot work in
Mexico. The edges of the book are
mouse eaten and its pages are scarred
by book worms, but it is still read-,
able.

The book is an eulogy of St. Francis
Xavier. originally given at Manilia in
the church or St. ignacius Loyola, The
paper is excellent, and the type is
clean. Since it was made not long
after the invention or printing, block
printing was used for it.

The letters show the intiuence of
the illuminated manuscripts. It is
bound in vellum.

Mr. Hopkins who is in charge of the
Cult Division of the Red Cross, was
sent to Mexico to care tor the earth,
quake sutterers. While there he}
worked with the only American priest!
allowed to remain in Mexico, and it‘
was this priest who gave him the
book. It had been found by the priest
when he was cataloguing the library
at Cordova.
