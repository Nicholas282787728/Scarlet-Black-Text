, ENTERTAINMENT

One or the greatest things to over—
eoine in a college where there are ho,
fraternities, is the lack of feeling or‘
responsibility 'on the part oi the stud—
ents for the entertainment of visrtoi .
Friends or the college or iriends of
students are constantly visiting at the-
dol'nhltol‘ies or other places on the
campus, and the lack of attention
given them is' deplorable,

Graduates are particularly aware of
this, especially the older alumni who
visit the campus occasionally and
sometimes hiing lrienils with them.

The feeling that a. guest on the
campus is 'merely the invited guest
of the student In question, and the
failure to see that anyone on the
campus is the guest or the whole coir
lege, has been the cause of many ems
bari-assrnents in the past few years
and has otten costwthe college new
students who might ‘have come here if
the slightest attention had been given
them. .

Anyone who has visited at a iratere
nity house on some other campus has
noticed the- apparent welcome given
him by all or the members of the tra-
tel‘nity, each member of Which is

ELE'CTIVE HOUSES

It has heeu seen that something is
lacking in the organization or the
men's halls tor the entertainment or
visitors. The main problem at the
dormitories, if there is any problem,
is in'the present manner of selecting
rooms. Groups will naturally di-llt
together, and will choose rooms in the
