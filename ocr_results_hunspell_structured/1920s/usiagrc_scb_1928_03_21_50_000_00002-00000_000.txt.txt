STfliEST RESPONSIBILITY.

VOL. 45.

The discussion at a recent. meeting of the Lantern
society brought out the fact that there are two opposing
camps on the student government battle ground, Those
who oppose the huild—unit plan, as previously outlined
in this paper, contend that it destroys student l'espunsi»
hility by taking away the old Court, or its principles as
an all—student body, by substituting in its place the
College Council, to be composed or seven students and
five faculty memhers, They would leave the judicial
group as it was under the old system, with a tow minor
changes, and secure faculty co—operation through the
legislative body or the men‘s government.

it happens that tho building-unit plan would do away
with the old Cour and it also happens that the greater
share or the opposition to this plan comes from the meni-
bers of the old Court. '

in thus attaching the new plan, the emphasis is being
shitted to the wrong place. The very ioundation or the
building-unit plan of gmernment is student responsibil—
ity. In every hall there would be a House Committee or
‘the house chairman and three other students elected by
the students in that hall.to administer the affairs of that
ball and handle all minor disciplinary matters aside trom

stealing, drinking and ganipliug, which major offenses
\\ oullt be handled b ' the College Council, The legis lti\f
bod would lie 2‘. siiulll, efficient group of the imusc
chlllrnlcn entrusted t)) the men to mill“? l1\\ls rind to
bring lilnllllllilinistrutioll of any building to the rlttcntioll
of thc College council. The whole illezi is to plficc tlic
rcSpoIiSlhililY of government on the men in such ii inan-
iicr that. there “ill be little need for the College Council
to act, cxcept in emergency cases where strident
responsibility flills down Iftthc men Eire not capable of
governing thclilscb'es in minor matters, ill building lilo,
Alllll iii milking their own lltus to regulate (hilt life, they
are certainly not responsible zit all. If they must. have
their faculty coropei'ation (which must be secured in
some manner) in the legislative group and in minor
affairs, they consequently lime less responsibility allow-
ed to them. It works on .\ Sliding scale.

Supposing that the old Court were superimposed above
such a co-operative gr as the Opponents of the
building-unit plnn Suggest. Thcre would be the same
difficulty of presenting the evidence, of forcing this com-
uiittco to accept. i'eJECl, or refer hack, Every time a
nifm's cnse passes from one body [a another in this mans
nor, his chance for justice is lessened because the sec-
and body cannot. present. the evidence as fully (IS it. was
presented in a trial. And just. (is soon its a, Court (le—
eisiou is rejected by the‘ administration committee, Just
that. Soon is the confidence in that government blasted,
Cﬂntrnry to current belief, n11 Court. decisions in the past
have not met with the approval of the administration
committee, even though such outward approval was the
decision given to the public. This Committee realized
that if it rejected ii, decision of the Court, that Cour! W’ls
doomed and student government was damned, which in-
dicates that. there is (in inherent Weakness in the Court
System which would make it. prove itself inadequate in
the future just as it has proved itself inadequate re~
cently.

\Vhere student responsibility should be centered is
in the government of his dormito ' life. Where a man
should demand faculty cosoperzttion and mature Judgment
is in an important case which may affect his \i‘hole
economic future—and it is only such cascs that the 0017
loge Council would handle.

It appears that, in order to simplify this operation of
judgment to a single decision. subject to review only by
the President of tlie college, it. would be necessary for
him to appoint the faculty members to this Council. We
are willing to accede this point, if it will secure this
simplification for which the inch are striving in attempt-
ing to secure justice. The seven sludCiits. who would
serve on this Council would have El. dacided responsibility
in representing the men of the school and the college as
a Whole. Their positions would be highly honored ones,
for they would have to be men who had minds of their
own, The live facility members would be responsible
to their group and to the trustees. The College Council
would represent a co—opemllve body presenting a united
front to public sentiment and dispensing pi‘opsr justice‘
to the men, '

But if student. responsibility in the lower parts of
the men’s government was achieved (is is planned, this
Council would have little to do and scarcely deserves
the emphasis which it has been given.

What is your opinion ol hmltaur
mid—stintsitr t\\. initiations;

Bolt Sliif‘ldsilt should be left to
the instructor. It the nature or his
course requires a two-hour exam, it
should hc provided for. In some cas-
cs extra time would he a fine thing.

Don L riliill general, i think one-
hour eiams at mid-semester are sut-
iicient.

.uurtlm J‘MicSiOne hour exams at
mitlssemester are usually long
enough to iiud out it the pupil has a
general idea of the course.

Anllur Risserione hour is time
enough for exams in most courses at
midssemester. The important thing is
to write all you know in the time ol—
lowed.

)Illriiln Iililir—I don't say they
shouldn't have them. iiut I don't want
them.

Lois l‘nscoeiTi-iey aren’t necessaryi
and i think they are too much strain.
it would be on the order or the quar—
tur system such as they have at
Amos.

Sani Elitero—hiid—semostor evanis
are not worthy of a special weelr, un—
less spring vacation is too short.

)luudo Stoberi‘lf there were not
more than two exams a day, and the
plan were run on the same schedule
as the final examinations. I think they.
would be all right.

M. Jean HoweuiIf exams must be
given, certainly one thr is long
enough.

(is the presidential iavorite in the Col-
leges, with Al Smith trailing along i’l.‘
outstanding Democratic choice. of
2210 hilllnts cast. ill the University of
Cincinnati, Hoover received 1281,
which was 58 per cent of all votes
crist, and 75 per cent of the Republi»
can poll. Smith Stood second with
436 votes, which represented 88 per-
cent or the Democratic choice. The
Antrsaloon League might be interest—
ed to know that Smith's main support
came from the law collage. Here
Hoover defeated the New York gover-
nor by only four votes, Whereas in
the other schools he gathered minty
times the Smith vote. Coolidge and

'Dawes followed the two leaders in the

order named. Willis did not {are
well with his fellow ohians, receiving
only 32 32 votes.

At Middlebul‘y college the high men
were again Hoover and Snlith. Of 529
votes cast. Hoover received 357, and
Smith 110. Smith's support came
mainly front the men.

On March 19 colleges throughout
the Country took part in a two-day
straw vote on the presidential possis
bililies. Seventy institutions were
represented in this first comprehens
sive attempt to measure college opin-
ion ori the forthcoming nominations.
Five Republicans and ﬁve Democrats
were named on the ballots, although
voters were free to write in the names
of other choices. Those listed wer
Curtis, Dawes, Hoover, Lowtien, W -
lis, Donahey, Reed, Ritchie, Smith and
Walsh, of Montana.

Stanford university, which has high
hopes of becoming alma mater of ﬂ
president, will dedicate its 1928 year
book to its most prominent alumnus,
Herbert Hoover.
