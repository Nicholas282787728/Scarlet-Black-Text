VISITORS AGAIN

When twenty high school girls come to Grinnell this
week-end as the guests of Women's Honor G, there will
arise once more the question or entertaining visitors on
the campus.

Like the delegates to the Iowa High School Press
convention and the Congregational Fellowship confer—
ence. the high school girl athletes will, of course, he
hospitahly received, They will ,be entertained with a ras-
cinating succession of dances. dinners and spreads. and
with a wisely limited number of inspirational speeches.
In all probability they will carry back to their respec-
tive communities glowing accounts of the wonderful res
ceptlon Grinnell accorded them, «

We hope that there will be nothing superﬁcial about
the welcome and entertainment of these visitors; that
they will be given an accurate impression of Grinhell

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

liic. It is greatly to be desired that whatever courte-
sies are extended to them will be the embodiment oi our
true nttitude towards them, the rcilection oi an honest
pleasure at having them here. Tllelr permanent evaluar
lion oi Grinnell college will be much higher it they can
lccl in later years that they were entertained, not only
us representatives or twenty high schools and as prospec-
tivc Grinnell students, ,hut ns individually attractive per-
sonalites,

llow runny Grinnell studcnis are interested in viml
\\0l'ld problems? The number may be iairly computed
(mm the size of the group which attends Henry Noel
Br lsicr s lecture on “Cruisers and Cmopcl’ation" to be
siren lomorrow evening in Herrick chapel,

Since Mr. Brallsfoi'd is an English journalist at wide
experience and biilnnccd judgment he is particularly well
equipped to discuss the cruiser question and its eitect
upon Anglo-American rclntion, Anyone who has the
slightest interest in world ailnirs ol' the least desire to
cultivate such an interest can not niiord to miss his lec-
lure,

.unny recent developments in international ititziirs
have tended to strain the relations between the United
States and Great Britain, Since the world war the two
nations have groun increasingly antagonistic. The war
debt settlement, tradc conditions iollowing tlle war, the
Anglo-French pact, and the United States cruiser hill
have each had a. part in widening the chasm between
the two countries. The important matter oi English pub-
lic opinion in regard to American policies will no doulu
he discussed by Mr. Brailsiord.

iviin the possibility looming up that another naval
lllllilzltlons conierence will be held soon, the dncstion oi
cruisers and cooperation takes on nddcd signiiicnuce.
What the eminent English publicist has to say about
AnglerAmerican relations should lie or unquestioned in-
terest to every live-mindcd person in Grinnell.

FOR WORLD 1’!) WE
The addition or one more committee to the roll oi
Campus organizations would not seem to deserve panic»
ulztr notice. But the creation or a Pence committee oi
the Y. w. C, A. bids inir m luliill a standing need by
stimulating a campusrwide interest in world peace.
With only three days oi nctirc 'lstcnce to its credit.

the committee has already established a reading table ‘

in the college library, and made plans for a series at
talks to be given here this spring by widely known paci—
ficts. They have also made ambitious plans in regard
to c speaking campaign to he carried on by the commit-
tee members through this county and in even more wide
spread territory,

The signiﬁcance or this new organization lies in the
[act that it has been iormed as a, nucleus around which
peace education may be centered, and irom which an in-
teresting peace may be disseminated. It has not been
created as an additional activity tor the members oi a
committee. it aims, rather, to instil within every Crinr
nell strident a realization oi the importance oi inter-
national cooperation and world peace.
