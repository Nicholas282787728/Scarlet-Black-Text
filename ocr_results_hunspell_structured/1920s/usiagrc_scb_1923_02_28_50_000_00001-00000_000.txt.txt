Kansas Augies

‘ Deteat has stalked the Pioneer team
ever since their victory over the Kan—
, ses Aggics at ilanhattan last Thurs-
day. They lost to Missouri Friday
night, and then, alter a tiring all-night
tip to Nor-man, Oklahoma, iollow—
in‘g their two hard games will: the
Aggies and Itansas ll., the Pioneers
couldn't stund the ,pace set by the
fresh Oklahoma team and suifered a
33-26 defeat. The game with Ames
here last night, which looked prumiSr
ing for the Pioneers at the end-of
the ﬁrst hall, resulted in another de—
Teat, this time to the.tiine of 26—17.
Both games were a disappointment to
local boosters.

Oklahoma Game.

In the Oklahoma game both teams
were tied ﬁve dillcrent times during
the drst half, although the Sooner-s
managed to climb into the lead as the
heir ended. by a his point margin,
the score being 18-16. In the second
half the Soonors ran away from the
fast ti ng Pioneers and the bait and
ed with the score 33726. Gilnisr, right
forward, and Cooke, lcit guard, were
the stars for the Oklahoma team. Gil—
iner scored tour ﬁeld goals and nine
tree throws, whilc Cocko shot three
ﬁeld goals.

Critcbett and Benz starred for Grin
ncll. Cr-itchett scored three ﬁcld goals
and Benz scored three goals and in
addition counted on four tree throws.
Gelvin came through with two goals,

' and Fearing and Whitehill made one
each.
Amos Game.

The game last night looked very
iarorable at the end of the ﬁrst hall,
with the score 11 to 7 in favor of
.the Pioneers. "Piliky" Greene, the
Allies ace, was being closely followed
by Galvin. During the ﬁrst half. when
Gclvin was guarding Greene, the red
haircd yorrth succeeded in eating only
one ﬁeld goal. After Gclvin was re—
moved on personals early in the sec-
ond halt, Greene broke through for
ﬁve ﬁeld goals. Whitcliill also went
out in the iii-st part of the second hall,
and alter this the team work of the
Pioneers was very evidently broken
up.

The crowd at the game last night
seemed very wrought up over the ap-
,pnrently onloir decisions or the re~
'lcrec, Britton or West Point. When
he called the foul that sent Galvin put

,0: the game the rooters protested and
hoo’ted so that he was iorccd to call
another foul on the crowd, Hedges
of Dartmouth has been engﬁged to
relcres the game with the Kansas
Agmes next Saturday night, ,

Atter the Cyclones had piled up a
safe margin near the end of the sec-
ond halt Greene was retired from the
game because he was no longer need-
ed. At that time the little whirlwind
from Ames was given an enthusiastic
ovation by the crowd as he left the
floor because or his clean and ﬂashy
playing.

The Pioneer points were made by
Benz, with three baskets and live
free throws, Critchett with two goals
and Whitchill with one. Benz and
Gelvin were the stars for Grilmell,
Gelvins' guarding bcing especially
noteworthy. Greene was the whole
Ames team, and is the flashicst for-
ward seen on the local floor this sea-
son.

“\l'e are drifting, switrly mill sin-sly.

click d. Libby, cxccutirc secretary
at the National Council tor the Pre-

by an. economic council. He said
that the real purpose oi the , ich in
the Ruhr is either to divide Germany
and annex the vest bank of the Rhine
or to setup there an independent buf-
ter state. This, he said, would pro-
duce nothing but national hatred and
would be productive of unending war~
fare ,between the French and the
Germans. France has already suc—
cceded in once again welding Gel-
niany into a united nation, Mr. Libby
pointed out, and a united Germany is
what France fears

The United States, he said, is hot

appropriation of this country for next‘
ycar amounts to 547 millions, with the
probabi ty that it will reach sou mil—
lion or a billion in a few years.
There is in existence a gas so deadly
that the entire population of London,
seven and a hair millions, could be
wiped out by an air raidin three
bonds. New york and Paris could be
wiped out in a correspondingly less
time. We lime that gas,

“Tlieie is nothing to do." said Mr.
Libby, “but to end war before war
ends us." The program or the Nation

cnlls tor (1) world organization or

in. Libby pointed out that the last
Ame ican Legion convention ,attend—
ed by men who know what war is,
came out squarely in iavor of reduc~
tion of armaments to police status
