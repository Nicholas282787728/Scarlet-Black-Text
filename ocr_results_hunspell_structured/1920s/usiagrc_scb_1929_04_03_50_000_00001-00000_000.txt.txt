Personnel of Squad for Carnival
‘ At Kansas To Be Determined
By Results of Meet.

Iowa roads caused the itrst great
disaster oi the year Tuesday when
they prevented outdoor track pl‘ac»
tiec from getting under way under
the eye ot Coach Duke as scheduled.

day night. however, and regular
workouts started in earnest today.

a large measure determine who will
take part in the Kansas relays ior
Grinnell the following week. At the
Dissent time there are 22 universities
and 25 colleges outside or Kansas en-
tered in the Kansas meet including
many oi the Big Ten and Big six
colleges. Occidental College or Los
Angeles is also listed among the en-
tries.

Advance dope on the home meet
is hardly available at this time, It
some weight and distance men show
up from any class it may go a long
way toward changing the outcome. At
the present time. however, the sopho-
mores appear to have a berth at the
top with the seniors pushing thorn
'bard. Miner, Douglass, Secor, Hells
sley, and possibly Taylor, cut a big.
figure for the sophs, while McKee,
Mommy and nisser_wili push things
tor the seniors.

Workmen have been going over the
track during spring vacation, and it
is now in first class shape ior the
opening of the season.

Past Playing of Sophs.

The sophomore girls- basketball
team retained the inter-class cham-
pionship this year by defeating the
juniors 34 to 12 in the decisive strug—
gle, played March 20.

The speed and teamwork of the
players has again proved invincible,
even at the hzinds of the Seasoned
juniors who won the championship in
1927.

The last team work oi hicLeran
and Carlson, forwards, helped them
lead the sophomores to victory, but
both of them suffered ankle injuries

State Legislative Bodies Would Put
Drastic Restrictions on Hitch-Hikers

New York N Y.*Somc joker in the
New Hampshire Legislature has pro-
posed it license fee for hitchshikcl’s
amounting to $5.50 per person. Aer
cording to newspaper reports, anoth—
er measure, was also proposed that
would require them-to display two
heritlligliis and (i taillight when tmv»
cling tit night.

No c‘ause ior laughter is contained
in the pending Pennsylvania. bill,
however. It follows the example of
New Jersey in forbidding this most
pleasant and diverting form 01' trav-
el.

"When it becomes (l crime,” Come
pluins the Dicltsonicn, student news-
paper of Dickinson college, "for it
clean cut. intelligent. honest college
boy to risk it passing motorist For (hi:
means to get to his home and par-
eiits during it brief vacation period
then it is time to question the discr'e-
lion oi legislative bodies."

A survey over the country indicates
a crowing tendency on the part or
state otrrcials to legislate against the
practice oi catching rides. MinnesoA
ta was one of the ltrst states in the
middle west to make it unlawtui tor
on individual to ci h tides alon: the
highways.

One newspaper writer contends
that “llitchdl lzrs” are responsible
tor the majority ot highway robberies
and other misdemeanors against mo-
torists. This writer, a member or the
stati oi one ot the larger c y papers,
goes turther to say that the reduction
in the number oi hikers would show
a proportional decrease in the number
or crimes committed.

Oil the other hand colleges and uni—
versities are quick to detend the prncs
lice. Like the Dickinson college stu—
dents. the majority or college men
feel that the practice of hiking is
legitimate and harmless.

Scribe Declares Student Morals ,
Are Not What They Were in 1400

Criuncll students who chase merri-
ly over the walks on roller skates
live happily ever alter; but a univer—
sity student live hundred years ago
who tossed a ball or strummcd a
guitar was punished more severely
than it he had hailed a [armor and
stolen his chickens.

Asccticism was the cornerstone ot
the European university in the four-
teenth and litteen centuries. Athletic
games were absolutely iorbidden, and
woe unto the student who danced or
played chess. Using a musical in-
strument was worse than a crime.

"Down with the flesh" was the sin-
gan ol the medieval college president.
The winter wind wlllstled through the
students' quarters, which had no tire-
places or stoves. Grinneil students
may ieel that Arbor lake water does-
n'L make a tempting bath. but one
or the old colleges oi the University
or Paris used to win its students’
souls by depriving them or all sanls
tation. Starving and whipping were
also efficient in subdoing the soul, the

 

old universities discovered.

Why pity the poor cared who has
to be in by ion? The student of 1400
A. D. was not allowed to go outside
the college walls without an official
attendant, on pain of being bit-cited!

There seems to have been a good
bit or student llesh that remained un-
subdued. though. Pal-ls students let
their clerical tonsilres protect them
while they exuberenlly killed luer.

chants, carried off their daughters.
and broke into houses. Oxford boys
didn't let their French neighbors out-
do them in those respects. Masters
of Arts. clergymen, and college pro-
fessors would all join in a. good street
brawl.

The iourteenth century was the
heyday ot the town and gown row. A
pewter mug thrown by an extol-d
strident at an inn-keeper's head
brought on a real riot, without mur-
dering, and burning oi college halls.

No, student morals aren't what they
use to be.

The date tor the election or the

the house council has been set tor
ilonday night, April 2. The eleclr
ions will take place in the clubrooms
with the present house chairmen pre-
siding. The time for the meetings
will be announced by the individual
house chairmen,

As in the past every man in the
building will be eligible to vote ior
housc chairma except the candidates.
It is customary that all candidates for
the house Chairmanship are men from
[ha junior class who will be seniors
during their tenure of office.

In the ease oi the house council
elections all men are eligible for
voting and candidates must be either
sophomores or juniors this year, The
theory behind this ruling is that the
governing body at the building
should be composed of juniors and
seniors,

Newly elected house chairmen and
their councils will assume office at
once under the existing plan. 31*
though the old group will remain as
an advisory body the remainder oi

Disastrous as the trip might appear
to a casual reader in ihe matter at

through the vacation period, cannot
be considered as it loss, for the bene-
fits derived by the locitl netste'i's far

feats which were suffered at the
hands of several of the greatest len-

country.

In eight matches the Pioneers won
two, tied two and lost four. But two
of the four losses were by decisive
margins, Texas university and Tulane
swamping the Grinnell men. Griunell

Texas university. boasting one of
the most powerful net teams in the
nation, overwhelmed the local team by

of the country spilled Coggeshall in
the opening match, and his team—
