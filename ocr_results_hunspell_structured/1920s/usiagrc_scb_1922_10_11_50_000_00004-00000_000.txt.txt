Old Timer Explains
Examination

AS per usual, with examinnﬁons
staring them in the race, our young
friends are worrying about their
grades. As a source of inspiration to
the older ones a! knowledge to the
youth, we proffer the following expla-
nation of those dire standards as de-
ﬁned by one professor:

A Student: Ono who, in an examina-
tion, returns in an assimilated
form all that the professor has
said in the classroom.

15 student: One who returns to the
Professor all that he has said in
the class room in exactly the
same form.

C Student: One who returns to the
processor all that he has said in
the class room in the same form
with considerable left out.

in student: One who returns to the,
professor what he has said int
the Class room with just enough|
left, IN to get him by.
