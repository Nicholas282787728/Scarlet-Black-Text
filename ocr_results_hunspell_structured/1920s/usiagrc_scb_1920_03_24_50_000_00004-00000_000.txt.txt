Haven't stuck by every rule;

or just why you came to school;

Spent your Sunday evenings Walking,

01' perhaps took lo a show,

Or just strolled nround the campus

worn there’s no place else to go;

Or you've whispered in the lib.—

That’s an easy thing to do—

And noticed not the piercing glances

The llhrnrinn's sent at you:

And then you get or bunch of missives,

Doling out punishment for wrong

You’ve done, oh. then you realize

That life ain‘t all one grand sweet

lulu ANNUAL SGHEVE

EVENING IS UBSERVEU

Prof, Scheve Talks to Quad Girls
On Music and Illustrates
With Selections.

The third annual "Scheve Evening"l
was held at the Quadrangle Sunday
night, when Prof. Edward A. Scheve
gave a, short talk on the mission of
music, illustrating it with appropriate
selections, mftny of them his own com—
positions.

Professor Schcyc said that there are
two kinds of music, the “absolute." 0]"
pure music, Written Without any exter-
nal object or reeling in mind, and the
"descriptive," which pictures some
emotion or mood, or endeavors to des-
cribe some object. However, "abso-
lute" music is almost unknown in act—
ital experience, hccausc all music ex-
presses some meeling even if the com.
poser did not have it in mind at the
time, of writing ‘Descrintivc music
cannot paint before you the Sunset.
or flower, or Whatever is hclng dcs—
cribed, but it can revereate the atmos—
phere in which these have their exist
ence. ,

Esplnius Mission at Music.

Professor Schcye explained that the
mission or music is not to entertain,
not to give an intellectual exercise,
nor to express the composer's feelings,
it is to make the world a better place
to live in. '

As examples of Absolute music, Miss
Lois Rogers played a "Prelude and
Fuﬁue in G major” by, John Sebastian
Bach, and an etude "Impromptu Gas
price" by Protes'sor Scheve. Miss
Grace Seary and Professor Scbevc
played the slow movements irom his
violin concerto. '

As examples of Descriptive music
Professor Scheve played the Chopin
"Funeral March." and; with Miss
Scary, played a group for violin and
piano “Meditations on Quotations from
the Psalms.” or this group, Nos. 1.
l, and 5, were played, a "Choral," an
"Elegie" cud a “Song." Miss Rogers
played il, descriptive group of piano
picccs by Professor Scheve, “Sunset,"
"Mystic Moonlight," and “Evening
Song.”

Professor Selleve concluded his pro-
gram with somc improvisations on fa—
millar melodies, asking the girls to
sing the old songs as he played them.

Nan Ashby, in behall oi the Quad-
tangle girls, presented the musicians
with flowers as an expression of ap~
predation.

PLAYS MAKE HIT

(continued from Page one)

and her success therefore the more
worthy of commendation.
)Ils’ Trot Makes nit.

Susan Saar as the energetic Mls',
Trot polished lamp chimneys and wor—
ried about the wild buffalo bug roam-
ing unmolcstcd on her parlor carpet
to the entire satisfaction of the audh
ence. William Moyer as Ezra Wil-
liams succeeded with his grufincss in
such realistic fashion that there Were
undoubtedly many cbivalrous champ-
ions in the audience who would gladly
have attempted to teach him better
manners in the company of such
harmless, likable ladies as those pres-
ent in Mis' Abel's kitchen.

Belle Scott as the charming Inez bad
the hard luck to have to not very
nearly natural which everybody anws
is the hardest thing possible to do he»
forc an audience. Miss Scott is there-
fore thrice welcome to our pcon of
praise.

Elizabeth earringor ns Mls’ Elmlra
Moran and Margaret Mcana as Mls‘
Carry Ellsworth were also worthy
mcmhcrs of the cast.

“Suppressed Desires” [5 Satire.

"Supprcsscd ocslrca" proved a de»
llghtful little Satire on the psychologi—
cal theories of Professors Freud and
Jung. It was written by Susan Glas-
ncll, a former rowan. Paul Reed as
stcphcn Brewster appeared to slightly
better advantage than the other two
members of the cast, Mr. Read doubt—
less dlscovcrcd that it is one thing to
smoke n cigaret in the scoluslon of

 

one's study and quite another to smoke

,cnpnhlc support.

Marion Rath as Henrietta Brewster
car cd through her rather difficult
part with flying colors, and Mary Rob~
bins cs Mabel, hcr sister. proved a
charming angel of common sense.
The acting of Frank Dorathy as
King Argimenes was one of the out—

rlmma by Lord Dunszmy, His acting
was forceful and well adapted to the
Dullsany drama.
Directors Dcserm.l’l'uiso.
Robert I-la'nnelly as Zarll gave him
at the minor char-
acters Haldane Crooks or King Dar-l

and Ernest Larson or the King's Over-
seer deserve special mention. Velma
Appleby, Eleanor Read, Florence Ours
and Helen McVay took the parts of

and Throgolind creditably. The cast
was completed by Hall Clovis its The
Idol Guard, Leslie Cushman as an old
slave, John Decker as a young slave,
H. ‘V. Vogler and W, H. Vogler as

guards and Robert Wright. Otto Hein-
l'ichs and Murray Russellyras addi-

tional slaves.
