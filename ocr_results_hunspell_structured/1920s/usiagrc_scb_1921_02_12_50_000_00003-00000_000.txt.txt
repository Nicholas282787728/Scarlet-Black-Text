lW‘lth House Peters in "Lying Lips,”
,the Thomas H. Ines-Associated Pmr
‘ducers, Inc., special which is show-
ing Sunday and Monday at the Colo-
:nial Theatre, is considered by sever-
al famous artists as the most beau»
tiful- woman before the public today.
Miss Vidal": perfect features not only
photograph with strikingmﬂect, but
are augmented by grace and poise
seldom equalled either on stage or
screen.

“Her First Elopenlent”

The plot concerns two families, both
of which strive to break the hold of
la. notorious "vampire" on younger
[male members. Adrian Maitiaud de-
ltermlnes to save his kid brother by
lkidnapping and “compromising" the
skittish siren, while Christina Elliot,
won to sympathy by her cousin, de~
cides to befriend the lady. Adrian

Amer home on an island under cirhumr

night on the‘ yacht will fix things. It
docs; but not in the way he antler
pntcsl Complications pile up to ior-m
a perfect riot oi fun. It is a really
excellent comedy-drama with nothing
smutty to spoil the fun. Miss Haw
ley's impersonation is wholly delight-
ful and she is fortunatein having the
splendid support of Jerome Patrick,
Herbert Standing, Nell Craig, Lucien
Littlefield, Helen Dunbar and Edwin
:Stevens. Sam Woods directed the
production, which is a Realzi‘t pic-
ture. ‘

Tultoviiu THE WRONG noon

Madge Kennedy lost her dignity
during the filming at a scenc in her
new Goldwynpicture, “Through the
‘Wroug Door," to be seen at the Strand
Theatre, beginning Saturday.

Madge Kennedy, with the aid of a
ladder, found a place on a secure
bough; and then the hear was told
to go [o it He did. And he didn't
stop going. N01. content With acting
the part expected of him, he eluded
everyone and kept Du Climbing. Then
the thrills began!

However, the owner caught up with
his {Our-footed charge before he had
a chance to overtake Miss Kennedy.

STRAND

“The Offshore Pirate,” a Metro
special production, Starring adorable
Viola Dana, comes as the teature at.
traction at the Strand Theatre on
Sunday.

Opinion in other cities where this
picture has been Seen, pronounce: it
a wonderfully acted, convincing bit
of work. This is due both to the
’skill put into its production, and to
the fact that it is an adaptation :rom
a Saturday Evening Post story by
the Wellelmowzl fiction writer, F. Scott
Fitzgerald.

“The offshore Pirate" is the story
of a group at people who adopt des-
perate measures to Save Anilta. Far-
nam, an heiress, from the wiles of a
scheming Russian who is after her
money. Piraticai tactics in Ardita’s
spruce yacht bring about a series of
thrilling escapades, ending in a re-
versal of the intrigner’s hopes, and
ithe ushering in of new ones.

this about once a month. We have
seen Pigolettc, ll Trovatore, Faust,
Minon and othcilo,‘ very well pro-
duced, too. Our other social pleas-
ure is visiting Masonic lodges here
but 1 am leaving that (01' Earl to tell.
1 hope soon that a dance will be pro-
mulgated among the American colony
so that may lead to a little variety.

“I experienced a mighty interesting
thing yesterday. Douglass (one of
the other teachers) and 1 were in—
vited out to the home of one of our
Mohammedan students. His lathcr,
two uncles, and a little brother and
sister were there. The two uncles
could talk English but the father-
couid not: I used up my,scauiy sup—
ply of Arabic and would have given
a lot to have known more because the
father was a fine old patriarch. He
looked like he had some line ideas
but could not express them to me. lils
brother and sister, 3 and u respective
iy, came iii and grabbed our right
hands, kissed them on the back and
then pressed it to their forehead. lt
cert- 'uly was a beautiful way oi
showing their respect. They were
nice clean little children too so that
helped. We had wonderful tea, cakes,
sweets, pears and bananas. The lat—
ter are very rare here 1 understand.
On the whole it was a most interest.-
ing experience, and absolutely noth-
ing like i expected.

“Our plans ior- next year are rath-

Fiaus Indeﬁnite
er indcirnrte, but just now we are
planning on a hike through Palestine.
We hoped to go to Europe rl The
Passion Play was given but that has
been given up so now we are heading
for Palestine. We will take Lhe train
to lotia or perhaps go from Port ded
to Jotla by host and then hike cross
country and tramp all summer in
Palestine. It has been done before
and I guess Mosc and I are good for
it.
Organize Literary Society

“We are planning to organize two
literary societies this week. Math
thews will have charge of one and I
shall try to lead the other along paths
of virtue and knowledge. We think
it would be very appropriate to name
our societies, Forum and Chrestu»
mathia.

“It is hard to best some of the sen-
tences we get on composition papers.
Here is an example: "My friend has a
good sound and he songs well."

“Anything in the way of a date has
been limited to smiles across is tennis
net or conversation across a tea
table. Yes, if you live anywhere near
the English, you must respect the
custom of "having tea." Bread and
