COUNCIL GRANTS
CIGARETTE PERMIT,

Cigar Store to Sell Cigarettes in
About Ten Days’ Time.

A permit to sell gnrcttcs and ci
allelic papers at the'nex Cigar store
was granted to E. J. Sullivan at a spec-
fal meeting of thc city council Monday
evening. The motion to grant the per—
mit, made by Jantzcn and seconded by
Ent, was passed by a vote of thin to
one. Jantzcn, Ent, and Dickerson
voted in favor of the cigarette permit,
and Col-rough against it. Lowrey and
Pilgrim were absent.

The cigarette and Sunday movie
questions have caused an even split in
the council for a long time, and have
prevented the election of a mayor to
take the place of .I, L. McIlnath, rc-
signed. In the absence of two of the
up-holders of the blue laws, the cigar-
ette permit was put through which al~
lows the Cigltr store to sell cigarettes
until July l, 1925.

Mr, Sullivan reports that the Rex
Cigar Store will have no cigarettes for
sale for about ten days, He has made
several trips to Des moms to purchase
the necessary supplies, andwill an—
nounce their arrival in a Scarlet and

“Pinkey” Jones and. Scharnweber
Win Track Letter for
First Time.

Although they managed to take only
one first place, the Pioneers appropri-
ated enough seconds and thirds to
take third place in the annual State
meet at Amos last Saturday. low-c
was first with 19 3-5 points, Anies
second with 32 1-5, and Grinnell third
with 29;

Stock was the dark horse of the
meet, winning the broad jump event
with a leap of 21 feet, g 1-2 inches,
and heating such men as Jane‘s of
Iowa and orchaugh oi Drake. This
was the only place Grinnell won in
the ficld events as Ease failed to score
in the discus and shot put, and Crit-
chett was not in shape to he entered
in the pole vault. The muddy field
interfered with the iavclin throwers,
and counted for the poor mark made.
and possibly for Duke’s failure to
place in that event. ‘

in the dashes three men, Joucs,Sch-
arnwebcr, and Green qualified in the
finals, Jones getting a fourth out: of
both races, and Scharnwcber a third
in the 220. Both men beat out Young
of Drab-c, who won the dashes in the
duel at Des Moincs last week

Both of “Doc" Huff's hurdlcrs lilac,i
ed in those events. The' Iowa ath-
letcs wcrc too fast for Taylor, and
be got a second out of both races, al-
though he ran the low sticlrs under
:24 when Ernokins of Iowzt broke his
own world's record in 3 flat, Green
placed third ‘in the highs and fourth
in the lows.

In the 440 Kitchen was elbowed all
the fvay down the straightaway, and
boxed on the curve, which eliminated
his possibilities of winning, although
it is doubted if he could have beaten
Coullcr of Iowa who ran it in mas.
Kitchen ran a nice quarter in the last
lap of the mile relay, and enabled
Grinnell to take second. The Pier
ncer team consisted of Gillette, M.
Jones, Stctts, and Kitchen.

In the hall»milc Captain Mcllrath
took third, and Porter fourth, and
Meyer placed third in the two mile, a -
though the Grinnell milcrs, Brciten-
bacb and Bryant failed to score in the
mile. The half-mile relay was one
of the best raccspi tbc day, Solidi-u-
wcbcr, L. Jones, and M, Jcnps giving
Taylor a lead of about five yards, but
the pioneer anchor man was unable to
bcat Broolrins, the much touted Iowa
flash, who nosed him out in the last
few yards.

"Pinkey" Jones and Scharnwcbel-
were the men who won their track
letter for the first time, Joncs being
the only man who had not won his
l-ionol- G sweater before.

The Pioneers performed up to ex-
pectations in fast company, and en-
abled the fans to get a line on their
possibilities of placing in the Missouri
Valley meet at Lincoln next Satur-

 

Pandemonium Breaks Lbose When

Throughout the tiny tileil actions

I
had been suspicious, the gallnuts of

the verbal class. They had peered
shyly at each other, out of the corner
of their eyes, with tongues in checks,
and a knowing smile all their faces.

And packages, strange and mystcr-I

ions, were smuggled under long dark

cunts and deposited carefully ill the,

deep recesses of secret closets. There
was mystery in the all 1 Something
was rotten in Denmark,

And last night the storm broke. AI-
frightencd town people thought that
Sing Sing had poured forth its zebl‘z—
clothed population upon the local
streets; red capped lunatics paraded
the thoroughfares with snake dance,
war whoop,_und song; 'bcdlam broke
from the skies, and the annual fresh-
man pajama parade was upon us.

New and‘startling styles in robes lie
nuit were displayed, Building shields
and crests, gigantic numerals deslg»
nating the various men’s hails, grue—
some skulis and cross hones, as well
as the stripes of notoriety were used
to artistic advantage, according to the
individual taste. Black faced comb»
dians and tragedians ahounded, torn»
ing a motley and terrifying band as
they surged through the city streets;
holding up traffic, raiding library,
lunch rooms, theaters, and soft drink
parlors. '

As the line wound, its way toward
the Quadrangle, janitors, dcans, and
other guards were summoned to duty,
and all doors were securely locked and
bolted, But stopping short or the
abode of the fair, the juveniles lain
ricd to disport themselves on the

volley ball court, before the eyes oi
'tbc ever growing populace, And
leiut a. program they put on! Calisth-
‘enics, boxing and wrestling matches,
games of Icup fi-og and ring around
the rosy, pyramid building and a start-
ling array of novel stunts were pro-
vided for the amusement, wonder and
edificntion of the onlookers. In good
time the truck, hearing the Serena-
ders, which had led the parade, ape
pearcd, and wild peals of music rent
the air and stirred the blood. Solos.
Norwegian, saxaphone, piano, and
terpsichorcan, concluded the frivolity.

Then, in fittingly solemn march, the
freshman proceeded, one by one. to
drop their cherished (l) prep caps on
a blazing pile, Tears were in many
eyes, for each cap represented the
expenditure of a perfectly good dollar-
($1.00) cash; and each marked learn—
ed to love (or at least to know in-
timately) every tear, rip, and ink-
stain, in his size of d 3.4 headgear.
But the men stood the emotional
strain with noble fortitude, and [new
cd their temperamental ability to as-
sume the dignities and responsibilities
of full fledged sophomores next year:

Thus concluded ibc program. The
fresh had held his commencement ex—
ercises. Upper classmen may still you
“Prep," and occasional paddling part-
les may continue, for auld Iang syne,‘
but the freshman will fear no evil, the
superior rod and staff will not crush
him, for his head is anointed with civ-
ilized rail-dent, his cup runneth over
with importance; he is soon to step,
alone and unchallenged, into the home
which is prepared for him, the home
of his sophomoric ego.

Go as Gl-ifinell-in-Ohina
Representative.

Forrest Chapman, prominent mem-
ber of this year's graduating class,
will leave this summer for Grinucll-in-
China, as ashort term representative.
“Short term" means a period of two
years, during which he will teach
English to the boys in Tchcbow of
high school use.

Mr. Chapman has hen unusually ac-
tive in campus alfairs during his four
years in Grinnell, and only yesterday
won new honor in the form of Phi
Beta Kappa membership. He has
served on the Student Council, on the
Men’s Court and the Senate. He is
particularly interested in journalism.
A member of Sigma Delta Chi, he is
on the Malteaser Publication board,

the Scarlet and Black, and last" year
acted as cditor-idchiei of the 1924
Cyclone. In addition to his college

of the college book store.

Mr. M, J. Bradshaw, in a letter to
[the Scarlet and Black, says of him:

“I take great pleasure in dilnallncj
ing that the Home Committee oi the
Grinncll anhillzt, at its last mcctiug,
elected lir. Forrest Chapman to on to
C nnell n-China a. your short term
,lcprescutativc, The committee was
gratiﬁed at being able to send to this

oughly representative of Grinncll Col-
legc, and we be'licve that Mr. Chaps
lilau' going to China will show our
other Grinncli pcoplc in Techow that
they have our strong support, The
Committee did not choose Mr. Chap-
man because of any excessive picty,
nor because of superior athletic
prowess. He was thought to he ﬁnely
representative of this college, how-
ever, and we are persuaded that his
appointment will meet with the en!
thusiastic approval of our college
community."

Mr. Chapman is to take the placc of
John Decker, who, with his brother,
Mark Decker, teacher at Socchow
University, will sail for home June 1!),

(IO-EDS HAVE PLANNED
EFFECTIVE COSTUMES

May Pageant, to Be Given Friday,
An Entirely Original
Production.

Mortals and fairies will rejoice toe
gather at the happy climax of "The
Quest for the Moon-Goddess" which
will be celebrated Friday evening, my
23, on the central campus at 8 o’clock
sharp.

“The Quest for the Moan-Goddess"
originated in Grinnell. buss Clara J.
Andersen, who is directing the pro»
ductlon, conceived the idea, She was
assisted in lbe‘ltalian scene by Louise
Sutherland, in the French scene by
Roma. Knufiman, and the Japanese
scene by Ruby Neill, who thought out
the love plots. Roma. Kauffmzn has
set the prologue before the parlor-m-
ance and between the acts. Even the
music. which will be directed by Mr.
Hickenlell is partly a, Grinnell pm-
duct. In the Japanese scene, Elias

'Blum’s Tsuki will inspire the geishas

to trip ioyously.

The senior normal class has designs

Ed the strikingly brilliant costuming.
The lighting effects, which are be—
ing arranged by H. R. Ennis, the col-
lege engineer are to be very effect,

“The QuESt for the Moon-Goddess" is
by far the most stupendous spectacle
that the women's physical training de-
partment has yet attempted and thus
far its success is wholly assured. The
dress rehearsal of the entire cast will
he held Thursday afternoon in the
Women's gym.

in case of unfavorable weather, the
performance will be postponed until
Saturday evening.

Hits Churn-lug Plot

The plot of the pageant is a charm-
ing one ,which will be enhanced by
color, lightness, and rhythm through-
out. Briefly, the plan of the dance
drama is a s follows:

Through all the aeonsv since the
world began, the faithful Man in the
Moon has toiled to make the heavens
bright. in reward, he is permitted,
one May night, when mirth runs high,
to seek his heart‘s desire, the loveliest
of maidens. In old Japan, Princess
Sara sighs for him at the very festival
when Marquis lto celebrates to win
her hand. But the Man in the Moon's
tickleness bids Sal-a plight her truth
to Ito. At sunny Italy's Flower
Fiesta, the fairest of peasant maids
spurns tbc Mooilrmfin’s magic flower
to choose the Masked Minstrel's rose
and his ardent lnvc. At the gay
French court, Stephancttc, lady-in-
waiiing, flustered by the Man in the
Moon's attentions, drops the Queen's
scnrl which is dospuired of as lost until
Jacques, a gentle-innummniting, re
storcs it and wins Stcphanctte as a
reward. England's kisses, whirling
. dances, see him not.
Heavy-hearted, he seeks solace in
Fair mid, Here he makes Spring,
just rlcnscd from winter's icy clutch,
his bride. At the heck of the fairies,
mortals swarm into the Land of En-
chantment ill ecstncy over the great
love thntis to make the moonrlire
brighter.
