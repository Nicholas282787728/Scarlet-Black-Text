Do You Think

A Newspaper is a Business
Proposition.

You Will Millie New Seni-
ester‘s Resolutions.

Two opposing views of journalism
are stated by ‘Paul Scott Mower, war
correspondent, and Water Lippniau,
editor of the New Republic. ’

Paul Mower, writing in The Quill,

the official publication of Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalistic fratern-
ity, says; "A newspaper, as some peo—
ple who write for it are apt to for-
getpis before everything else a com-
mercial enterprise. Its aim is ti) make
money by the sale of its advertising
space. The yaiue of this space de-
pends, generally speaking, on circu-
lation. The newspaper will therefore
try to win as many readers as pos
sible, and the only way to win read-
ers is to interest them,"
”In an article published in the At-
lantic Monthly for December, Mr. Lip]?-
mann says: “While the reporter will
serve no cause, he will possess a
steady sense that the chief purpose
of.‘news' is to enable mankind to live
successfully toward the future."

Mr. Lippmann believes that editor-
ial policies are better done away with.
"All the gallant little sheets express-
’ ing particular programs," he says.

“are at bottom vanity and in the end

futility, so long as reporting of daily

news is left in untrained hands."
He concludes with the statement,

“We shall advance when

learned to seek truth. to reveal it andl

we have

publish it; when we are more for that:
than tor the privilege of arguing
about ideas in a fog.”

Mr. Lippmaun’s picture is utopian
in its outline. In that happy time
when gasoline will ﬂow like water
and everyone tells the truth a news-
paper of the kind which he proposes
would be in harmony. But at present,
with high prices reaching a greedy
hand for money and still more money,’
a publisher can hardly be blamed for.
remembering that the newspaper game ‘
is a business as well as an idealistic
profession.

As a College, Grinnell welcomes the
Congregational ministers of the state.
Her ideals of justice and honest ser-
vice are at one with those of the
principles which every minister of the
gospel professes. Our interests beingt
the same and we are the more closely

. bound together as workers toward the
same goal,
.__..a._———-

A new semester begins today, with
the smoke of battle from the exam—
inations struggle still in our eyes we
have made certain resolutions.

Those who have plugged through
the last semester conscientiously do-
ing every piece of work and then have
fallen below their expectations during
examinations have sworn that they
will join the ranks of the idlers.

Those who have
marks than they thought themselves
capable of getting have determined
that nothing shall stand between them
and a Phi Beta Kappa key. ,

The ordinary student whom ekms
nnds with his work only partially
done and whose wits only serve him
fairly well during an examination, has
taken a solemn oath never to get he-
hind in his work again.

With the coming oi: the next ex-
aminations the pluggers will still be

l\rill harc dropped by the wayside and

their work.
