Jess Coffer

or wholesome stagecratt that will he
oitered the local amusement public
tor a long time to come. Entirely free
from elaborately worked out situa-
tions, the play carries the audience
from gentle and rippling humor to un-
roarlous laughter, entirely through the
exquisite art at the players.

l Androcles was a Greek tailor who
had accepted Christianity, and in min-
‘1de1ir1g from home with his Wife, Ma
‘gaera. who refused to accept the are
dent faith or her husband, and con-
tinually llphraided him with a well—
simulated tongue lashing or a modern
shrew, they came upon a lion in the
woods.

Androcles' faith led him to lilndli-‘
ness towards all heasts. and through
the antics of the beast it was found
that he had a thorn in his paw, which
Androcles extracted. The gratitude
‘of the lien later furnishes the climax
of the play.

11 In the meantime there is suitticient
drama supplied by Miss Louise Sawyer
as Iavinia, a sweet raced Roman pris—
oner. and also the mighty zeal of For-
rovious, another Christian prisoner.
played by Neil Smith, to onset and
term a background tor the excruciat-
ing humility at Androcles. This part
.will be played by Jess Cotter and he
gives a superb nertormance
