Rules Starts All Over Con-

”Cooper-alien of the team, students
and laculty will he the slogan oi
Coach A. H. Elward when he makes
his initial appearance on the gridiron
this alter-noon tor the first oiiicial
practice or the year.

Elrvard, in an interview with a staff
reporter, stated that he had nothing
to say in regard to the team upon
taking charge or the squad. “My
chiel concern at the present time is
in regard to the student support,"
were the words with which Elivard
expressed his opinion. The strident
body cannot expect a winning team it
they do not support the players. in
the past, some of the students have
gone to neighboring schools to see a
football game when Grinnell was
playing on Ward field." There is
nothing so detrirnentai to the spirit
oi the team than such incidents," said
coach Elward. If the men have the
best of backing, it will he an added
inducement to do their best, thus
bringing about the proper spirit nec—
cessory for a winning team.

Face S if Schedule.

The Pioneers have a hard schedule
this season but with an abundance of
good material on hand, there is no
reason why they should not do credit
to themselves and the school they rep-
resent. The men this year are par--
ticularly interested in turning back
Cue and their old time rival, Drake.

According to the Missouri Valley
rules, the coach in lootball cannot
mite charge or the men until Sept. 15.
Until that time it is the custom for
the capain to give the ruen preliminary
workouts in order to get the men into
condition as rapidly as possible. El-
ward is very strict in regard to con-
dition but it is expected that he
should be satisfied in this respect
when he takes charge this afternoon.

BHAUSHRW SPEAKS ll

“Religion Is Greatest Stimulus to
Achievement" Is Theme at
Opening Meeting.

“Real Religion," said Prolessor I\Ial‘~
ion L. Bradshaw, Dean of the chair
of the Philosophy or Religion, at the
iirst meeting of the Y. M. C. A" should
deal with supreme realities. Re-
unl'eal is n11 abomin-

‘ﬂble thing, and must not be tolerated.”

“Under proper condition,” added Mr.
Bl'dllsllttw, ”religion is the greatest
possible stimulus to achievement,
[or nothing can stir olie‘s lite like
trite religion. To live a rcrtl life,
we must be in vital touch with the
object of our religious worship, with
the creator or our universe. Quoting
H. G, Wells, the speaker said, “Ree
ligron is the first thing and the last
llrill". Until a man knows God, his
work has no beginning and no ends
ing."

LAMENTATIONS OF OUR LOCAL
LARDNER TELL 0F BIG FIGHT

\l'hen Luis Angel Firpo, the wild
cow oi the pampas, rested his head
gently upon the canvas for ten sec-
ol‘ltls last. night, he surely played. a.
dirty trick upon several membersof
Gl‘iunell College, yet he certainly
“done right by others.” For instance
had Luis suspected [or a minute
that the Sanitary Barber Shop Would
lose a total or three shaves and three
haircuts to one customer, uodouht he
would have suffered Iwcamotor Talia.
before allowing Jackto send him
to the canvass permanently. Tire
Sanitary is planning to force Eddie, to
take these hall: cuts and shaves all
in one day, but Eddie is just big heart-
ed enough to do it without a. struggle.

Then again. one curly haired, blue
eyed boy of Dibble Hail risked some
lucl'e to the effect that Luis would be
resting in a. state 0! Coma. by the Start
01' the seventh round. Now If Firno
had heard or this slur upon his ability
as u. mitt expert, he would have been
standing at the end or the sixth
round, even though he resembled a

 

bronze statue, three thousand years
all], But Dempsey, who has it in lor
the curly haired better because he
was licked by him once, would have
eased up on hirpo and let him stay
intact long enough lor the Grinnell
sport to lose his thirty cents.

Many interesting bets were made
on the tight. One boy bet two to
one that Flrpo would look more like
a Chinaman than on Argentine at
the end or the tight. Another wag-
ercd that Luis would be able to streak
seven languages at the end of the
tight instead or live. one of which is
the l;:)?9:.)&—l language. Anotllr
or hot that there would be no knock-
out at all it the‘ light went fifteen
rounds.

Someone is kicking himselt today
because he didn't bet fifty to one
that Firpo would he knocked down
si times in two rounds and another
can't see why it was labeled the battle

of a whole Century 1' it lasted only

five minutes.

Miss Luella. J. Read spoke on "A.
Few Things We Should Think or
New." “One of the great questions
for each of us now is, "Vhat place
will I give to religion in my college
lire this year?" said Miss Read. “The
answer We give to the question will
determine the progress We make."
She then told Van Dyke's story or
“The Source," and applied it to the life
of the College girl. “It is in propor-
tion as we remember to \‘isil. the Soul'-
