CONSTITUTION D . It.

Last Monday, September 17, marked
the one hundred thirty-sixth anniver-
5313' of the signing of the Constitution
of the United States at America.
Through a movement instigated by the
Kiwanis clubs and supported by the
American Bar Association and other
national, public spirited organizations i
this Week has been designated as can
stltution Week.

It is the hope of these organizations
that during these seven days our Cone
stitntion will he the object of special
consideration and study in schools,
churches, and public meetings. Every-
one can realize the timeliness or this
suggestion. our nation seems today to
be drifting away from many of the
tundanlental provisions of that docu-
ment which constitutes the core of our
system of government.

Floggings, raids by masked night
riders, lynchings, mob violence, are
on the increase. Witness the sorry
state or affairs in Oklahoma where
martial law has had to he invoked to
protect the citizens of the state iroiu
those who would take the law of the
land into their own halids. Lifc, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness are‘
no longer the inviolable rights or our
citizenry in many parts of the nation.
Trial by jury, one or the most ancient
and most precious of our civil instituJ
tlons is openly flaunted.

We are not speaking of superﬁcial
political abuses, ur oi defective meth-
ods or machinery, but of the funds-
mcntal principles upon which our gove
ernmcnt was [minded and which are
imperiled by repeated violation.

The gravest danger to their contin-

ued vitality lies in the inertia and ins
difference of the American public It
-ioust he eiouscd to a realization of the
situation ztnd to a. study of the basic
rinciples of equitable government.
Olll' Constitution may be it rigid and
artiﬁcial document, yet it contains, as
the distillation or long centuries, the
essence of those great principles ol
equality, freedom, and justice that
come as near to being eternal truths
as anything on ellrth can be true and
eternal.

We its college students, because of

"the special opportunities at our di

posal, and because we are just entei
in; upon the full rights and lespon-

make a special effort to acquaint our-
selves with the principles and func-
ticniug oi our government.

If the college student is indifferent
.to the vital affairs or our nation, what

can be expected or the men and wu—
lnen who do not enjoy the privilege of
la college education? Where, then, will
the leaders of the next generation be
found?

-_c_._

THOSE WHO LEAVE.
We should not begin our year with-
'out wishing the best of success to
those of last year's faculty who have
been called to accept positions in other
college. Although we are sorry to
see them leave, they are to no son
gratulated ror attaining more respon—
sible fields of service in their chosen
profession.

The two instructors in the school or
music, Mrs. Mane] c. Starkey and Miss
Namol Winters were assets not only
to Grinnell but to the _commuuity.
They will he missed by a large num—
ber who enjoyed their friendship here.

Professor Albert. who goes to the
University 01' Redlands, was a consci-
entious teacher and the friend of ev—
ery freshmen who found this math a
little troublesome.

Professor Hartson had one of the
biggest teaching jobs on the campus,
handling the rapidly growing world in

on a very successful basis. He goes
to accept a professorship in psychol—
ngy at onerlin,

Although here comparatively
short time, Professor Suydam won for
himself an army of friends. In or out
of the classroom, his quiet, likeahle
personality, his scholarly and whole-
hearted interest in the subject which
he taught, and his willingness to lend
a helping hand wherever it could do
good, marked him as a man who
would leave a lasting impression on
