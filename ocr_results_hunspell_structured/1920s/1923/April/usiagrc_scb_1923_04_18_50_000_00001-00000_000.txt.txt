Thursday, Apr 19. the annual inter-
dorm baseball series will be opened by
a game between Smith Hall and Lao-
Igan Hall. Following that onc game,
the series will be played at the rate
of three games a week, and it is the
plan of those in charge to wind up the
series with three games between the
two teams highest in the percentage
column.

There‘ls little “dope" to be consul,
Cred. Building Four, champions ot
‘1... year . series, will undoubtedly
‘hflvc a weaker team than last season
because of the loss of their pitching
ace. Building Three has a number of
good men and are prophesying A suc-

Smith Hall, Langan Hall, and Dibble

Hall are untried quantities, but each

building has its ardent supporters.
Dibble and Langan appear to have the
‘edge on the other two, Dibble anticl-

they enjoyed in basketball.

The twenlyr‘nluth annual Men’s Glee
Club concert Friday nightlulﬁlletl all
promises. The program consisted of
numbers never heard before in Grin-
Dell With special features, united into
a splendid, well balanced concert. The
success of the coﬁert was shown by
the constant refusal of the audience
to rcccivoa single number without one '
or more cncorcs,

The ﬁrst number, Castilla, was one
of the most. difficult selections but was
‘beautitully rendered. A solo by Philip

’ Kalei- followed and before the audience

‘ was satisﬁed, “I Am King of the Dun-
geon,“ andv“I Love a Lass,” were used,
as ellcores. The club followed these
numbers with "A Love Symphony,"
"Archers' Marching Song" and "Swords
Out for Charlie " The real harmony
And ability of the club was shown by
these numbers. Other features of
the program were the violin solo by
Harvey Waugh, the cello solo by Mil—
‘ton Dieterich and the quartet composed
of Leland Dalbey, Harvey Waugh, Paul
Clovis and Prof. D. E. Peck. The Quar-
teL sang "Wake. Miss Lindy," and “En-
treaty” with ﬁne effect. The “Negro
Baptism" was a well received encore.
The program was concluded by three
Griunell songs, "Our College Is Our
Castle", "Griuuell-i-Yell," and “The
Alumni Song. The manner in which
these three songs Were rendered
showed clearly why the club placed
so high in the intercollegiate Glee
Club contest. The Grinnelb Yell
and the Alumni Song are very differ--
em. types brrt were equally well pre-
sented. ’
, Mrrch credit is due Mr. Peck tor his
excellent training, and to thc‘ club
memhers for their hard work. An
