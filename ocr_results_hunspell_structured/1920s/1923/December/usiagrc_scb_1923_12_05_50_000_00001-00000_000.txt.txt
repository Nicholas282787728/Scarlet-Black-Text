team for thirty-dye yards, followed by
Hickey's plunge over the goal Ma-

and Smith grabbed a. pass llor thirty»
ﬁve yards. The Creighton defense
held and Grinnell lost the ball on
downs.

Muhoney punted to E. Kingery who

line for Grinnell.

For Creighton, Speicher was the
star, while Quarterback Hickey and
the Whole Creighton line played high

may of the Pioneers. It was the
showing made by the team in the lust
three games that makes Grruneli fans
and hackers more reconciled with
the scores of the contests preceding
the Coe game.
