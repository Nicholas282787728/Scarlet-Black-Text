Final Lecture

"Greek philasnphy is the back-
ground ior Christianity. It adds
nothing to the Christian taith, hut
emphasizes certain truths which are
essential to Christianity, and a living
part of the teachings of Christ,” de—
clared the speaker in his ﬁnal lec-
ture on Greek philosophy. at Herrick
Chapel. Thuisdaymornicg The sub
ject of this lecture was "What has
Greck philosophv in common with]
the teachings of Christ, and how has!
is helped Christianity?"

The early church could not have
prospered without Greece and Greek
thought It was at Ephesus’, the cen-
ter of Greek life and thought in the
ﬁrst century A. D,, that Saint John
wrote the fourth gospel. Without the
Gr-eek,lcnguagc and literature, the
writing of this gospel would have
been impossible.
