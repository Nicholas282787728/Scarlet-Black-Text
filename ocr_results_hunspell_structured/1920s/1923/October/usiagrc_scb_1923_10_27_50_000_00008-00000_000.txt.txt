"To the Ladies” Presented to
S. R. 0. House as Initial Home-
coming Feature.

Playing to an s. R. 0. house the
Gn’nncll College Dramatic club pre-
sented the Kauffmmflcnnelly com-
edy- "Th th‘e Ladics" Friday night as
the first feature at Gi'lnnell's greatest
Homecoming.

The actors did well by the gay Iittlo
comedy, playing it in a light mood,
as if they understood the frequent
fun—poking of its authors. Several
scenes were uproariously funny, yet
careful restraint kept them from be-
coming farcical. Each satirical thrust
found its way home giving to many a
wife a secret thrill of satlstaction.

Lends Achieve Success

Lucille Kepford made of Elsie Beebe
a charming, brave, little Woman. Her
”Elsie" was a skillful characteriza-
tion, played in a suhdued, even, man-
ner. Her speech at the banquet was
a. little masterpiece in itself.

Although cast as Elsie's "dumb—bell"
husband, Paul Clovis won his audi-
ence and arouscd a great deal of
sympathy for the unfortunate hero,
With 6L rule which might have been a
stumbling block to a veteran actor.
iir. Clovis scored a personal success.

George Johnson and Katherine Aus»
land gave splendid pertorrnances as
Mr. and Mrs. John Kincui , Mr. John-
son gave great fume and vigoi to
his impersonation. Miss Ausland dc»l
lighted the audience with her sincere
portrayal at "Mr. Kincaid’s wiie."

The role of Chester Mullins, the
ubiquitous friend of the Beebe’s, was
an admirable vehicle tor Basil Tal-
hott. He used to great advantage a
pair of graceful hands, an atrocious
singing voice, and a forlorn smile.

A clever bit was the contribution of
James Work as Senatnr Cassldy. His
eloquent political address, exagger—
ated as it was, will he a sufficient
warning to embryo politicians.

Burdette Plotts was effective as
Tom Baker, Leonard's rival, ,chhard

and humorous individual.
