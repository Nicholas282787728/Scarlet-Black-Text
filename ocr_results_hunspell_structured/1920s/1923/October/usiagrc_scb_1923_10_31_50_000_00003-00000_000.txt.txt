recovered a dropkick attempted by
E [(ingery on the Grinneli thirty
yard line. A wide end run by Boel-l
,ter and a smash through the lilte‘
brought the score to 14 to a. Beel-
ter again scored when he broke a-
way for a fol-lyrniue yard run around
end.

As a rule, Drake stuck to straight
football, although one of the touch
downs was made via the forward pass
route. Quick to take advantage of
blocked kicks, the Blue and White
had no need of strategy to keep thel
game safely in their hands, Only
game safely in their hands. only once
during the contest did Gi-inncll get
within striking distance or the goal
line. Shortly after the first Drake
score, the Pioneers worked the hall
down to the Drake nineteen yard line
by the aerial route.
tried a dropkick after the Dulldogs
had held for three downs. hot the
kicked was blocked.

Pioneers Weak ii Fundamentals
‘ The Grinnell team showed
weak in the fundamentals of the
game, tackling, blocking, and charg—
ing. Many times a Drake runner
would struggle out or the clutches of
a Grinnell tackler. M. Smith, Wing,
and "Canny" Jones did the best tack-
ling for the Pioneers.
ant factor concerning the game is
this:
coach Elwerd did not send his men.
Fnthermore, there were a number of
new men in the lineup.
)[any Substitutes Usell

Elward substituted ireely in thel
last part of the game. ‘ cathcait,
Seharnweber. Jones, Kitchen, Cushrl
man, Fell,’ and Kepler were all per—l
mitted to get into the fray sometime;
during the contest. Several changes
were made in the first string lineup;
from the eleven who started the game
at Cornell. Taylor and Winter play-
ed ends, capt. Nichols and Duke,l
tackles; Dare and ‘Wond, guards;
Grimes, center; and Sweet, E. King—
ery, wing, and M. Smithin thehack—
field.

The strength of the victors was due

to superior interrerence and speed. .

Many times Grinnell linemen would
break through the forward wall only‘
to be put out of play by the running
interference. Boelter, Orebaugh, and
Sloan made excellent use or their
speed by skirting the ends .fol' sube
stantlal gains.

Although playing brilliantly at
times, the Pioneers were no match for
the machine—like precision and con—
sistent team—work of Solem’s Eull-
dogs. ‘

This Saturday is an open date for
the Pioneers and the time will prob—
ably be spent in scrimmage and d_rill
on fundamentals in preparation for
the Kansas Aggie game here
week.

Professor Lavell IS
Speaker at Prayers

Professor lavell, speaking at Sun-
day morning Prayers, chose as his
subject‘ "Jacobs Ladder."

“Is the vision of heaven consistent
with the realities of lifei The vis-
ion of heaven is consistent with life
if it reinforces and enriches the real—
ity‘nl life," said llr. Lovell.

There are two kinds ot visionsi
mental dritting and the building of air
castles. Mental drifting has been
severely condemned but great things
have come out or reverie. it may of»
ford us only relaxation, but we may
gain great good. Air castle building
is the leap of the mind from where it
now is to where it should he. ll we
strive for
air castles,
good in life." concluded Mr. Lavell.

Onalec I-ieldridge sang Caro Roma's
”I Come to Thee.”
