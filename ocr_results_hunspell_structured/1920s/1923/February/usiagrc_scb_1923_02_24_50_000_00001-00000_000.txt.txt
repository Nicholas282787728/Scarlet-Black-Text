Aggie Game.

in the Kansas Aggie game the
Piouee1s come th1ough strong in the
ﬁrst half, and ove1whclmed the Wili‘L
cats the bald ending to 5. They
clearly outplayed the Aggie team. The
second half, although more closelv
played was a decisive display of me t
tor the Grinnell team and proved their
supetiority over thcii opponents.

Only toui fouls wc1e called on the
Griunell team, all of them on White
hill. The Aggies counted six fouls,
live at which were turned into points

' by Benz. All of the Grinnell play—‘
ers, except Cushmon, who were taken

' on the trip, counted at least one ﬁeld
goal. Cushman got in too late in the
game to be in the ‘grollp.

Critchett made four ﬁeld goals, Gel-
vin, Benz and Whitehill.th1-ee each,
and Winter, Feming and Bogc one
each. Benz was high point man with
eleven points. The majority of the
shots were trom long range, and were
accurately placed. several of them
dropping through the hoop without
touching.

Kansas U. Game.

Kansas University played a ragged
game against the Pioneers last night
from the start, but had little trouble
in disposing of the Pioneers. Wolf
started the Kansas scoring early and
Kansas ran the score to s to 0 before
Gelvin broke into the scoring for
Grinncll with a long ﬁeld goal. The
half ended 22 to 8. Ackcrman was
high point men of the game with
eight points, ‘while Critcbett again
starved for Grinnell with three ﬁeld
goal and one free throw. He played
'a consistent game throughout. Cap-
tain Whitchill also played a good
guarding game.

I’cnetrilte Kansas Defense.

According to the Des Moines Res-
ister the game last night was some:
what rough alter the Kansas subs got
into the fray late in the second half
and Grinuell played Kansas on al-
most even terms from then on mak-
ing live points to eight for Kansas.
Boge, who replaced Benz in the sec-
ond halt, played a strong game but
was a bit prone to foul a‘nd piled up
three personals while he was in ac—
tion. Grinnoll penetrated the Kansas
defense on numerous occasions, a
thing not usually done this season. but
failed to do so consistently and to
register baskets on their shots.

Kansas played eleven men during
the game and Griunell played eighte
the entire number taken on the trip.

Edwards, Wu, Harshbarger, and
B..Junes Receive Mid-
Year Honors.

Hazel Edwards, K. C. Wu, Frances
-iinrshbargcr and Burton Jones were
Ithe four seniors who received the
mill-year Phi Beta Kappa awards at
,Chapel Thursday morning. These
‘foul' people ranked the highest in
their class 111 scholarship, and were
g1ren the honor on the basis of their
choiarship ranking The other mem-
bers to be elected from the senior
class in June will be considered on
the basis of other activities as Well
,as scholarship. but the exact num-
!ber who will receive this honor is
'not ‘known at present.

The maximum to be elected trom
1each class can not excced one seventh
of the class, but this maximumus
rarely reached. Besides the Beta
,chapter or the iratcrnity here at
Gl'inllell and the Alpha chapter at
,Iora, a new chapter was just instal-
icd at Drake last September.

The original charter lor the Phi
Beta Kappa fraternity Was granted to
William and Many College before the
Revolutionary War for the encourage-
ment 01' excellence in scholastic work.
1During the war the original charter,
along with other records or the chap-
lter, were hidden from the British in
order to preserve them. The char—
routers on one side of the hey are un~
known, but on the other side the
characters are translated to mean
“Philosophy, the guide of Lite."

All candidates are elected by the
,mcmhels ol the local chapter on the
.1cco1u1nendat1on of the administra-
'tion.

K. c. Wu, who ranked the second
highest 1n the class.‘lms been in Grin—
11eii only a ycernnd a half. He came
here from Peking College in Peking,
China, last year, and since then has
made an enviable record 111 scholar—
ship. He is the ﬁrst foleign student
111 Griunell College to rece1re the Phi
Beta Kappa honor, and this achieve-
ment is all the more remarkable be-
cause he is only 19 years old.

cveuing for all the girls in the col-
lege. All Georges and'tlleir Marthes

number of weltzcs, the Virginia Reel,
the Rye Waltz, and. the Fireﬂy Waltz,

Grinneil Colonial Ball.

Unusual interest has been shown in
the Ball this year. Practiccﬂly all the
girls in the college are expected to
attend. A number or girls are ens
tortaining cute obtown guests over
the week end, and approximately
sixty alumnae have come back for
this, one of the most memorable events
in a Grinneli girl-s college year.

Frederick H. Bulr, supelintcndcnt
of schools of Colorado Sp ngs, de-
lll'ei‘ed an address in Her ck Chapel
last Thursday night on the subject
or "The Essential Features of a. Good
School System." lur. Bali's lecture
was doubly interesting‘ to a Grinnell
audience because or the fact that he
is an alumnus oi Grillncll, a member
of the class of 1912,

Mr. Bair stated that the factors
most important to be considered in
any school were the building, stall
and program. He especially em-
phasized the important part played
by the program and criticized the pres
sent programs of secondary schools
because he said they are too multi-
various so that the pupil is adminISr

facts which cannot possibly result in
any food, of coordinated knowledge.

As a remedyior this deplorable
state 0! affairs, Mr. Bait suggested in-
stead that four subjects should be
stressed; health studies. language
studies. natural science and social
science. Each of these departments
should then be enriched 1nd made as
meaningful as possible so that it
might play .1 vital part in the young
child's experience. Nrttnritl science,
the speaker maintained, is now almost
completely confined to geography in
the lower grades. This subject should
be enlarged so as to include every»
thing from astronomy to the under-

Stationary While the Men

Numerous upsets 111 :1d1auce dope
lectured the report or grades for the
past scmcsicr. Averages, on the
whole, 1e1uomcd practically the same.
Thc girls just equalliny their average
of 33 paiuts made at rmtlrsci'estcl‘;
the men raising their average one
point from so to 31. Organizations
took a decided advoncc 111 standing,
but their
the slump made by the Freshman
class. Prep men dropped 3 points to
the low mark or it, and the girls lost
one point. 1

The most (lectdcil advance was
luafle by the Men's Senate which rais—
ed its average from 31 to ill. Their
gain was closely seconded by that
of the Annual Board men who rose
from 19 to 59 and took the lead oi
all men's organizations. 0n the
whole, women's organizations remain—
ed practically stationary, Cap and
Gown making the greatest advance of
ﬁve points. Ellis and Forum load the
women’s and men's societies with an
evcrage of 45 points apiece. The wo—
mcns soc1eties were comparatively
bunched, 1 bore four points separate
iug the leader, Ellis, from the lowest,
C1loca.

Compared by residences, the town‘

gi1is and Cottage IV are tied for rust
place with .11 points apiece. Dihble
and smith also tied ior honors at the
Dormitories with as.

1 The standings by classes seemingly
followed the rule ol seniority. both
men and women being led by the sen-
ior class and followed in order by
Juniors sophomores and freshmen
respectively.

As usual. the Quaditcs excelled the
Dormitcs in scholastic ability, the
women maintaining an average or as
points and the men on points. By
,this point system a grade of A regis—
tcrs a points, B 3 points, C 2 points,
D no points, and E a -2 points.

1Farm Credit Legislation Badly
Tangled —— Thirty Minute
Battle in Dublin.
The President‘s sinp subsidy pro-

obstructionists in the Senate. Repub—
lican ranks have been broken by the

tarin bloc coalition. Leaders of the

wind up the work on thci1 own pet

they have been apathetic to the bill all
along and have been held in line by
their loyalty to Harding. “
Flinn Credit Tangle.

Farm credit legislation seems to be
in .1 bad tangle at the present time
Ha1dings intewention in an attempt
to straighten out the legislative pro-
gram has aroused the ire of various
congressmen who consider it an‘ en-
croacbment upon their sacred domain.
The controversy in Congress has cen-
tered chiefly around the LenrootsAn-
dcrson bill which has ben assailed by
secretary Mellon as "danegl'ous" and
“unworkable," 0n the other hand this
measure has received the public in-

Hoover. At all events it seems that
the farmers will have to wait for some
time helore they can beneﬁt by any
new legislation.
