Weight, height and age of Gl'lnneli';
freshmen. He also compares, in tin
stutlsﬁcs. the Gi‘inncli freshmen ' itli
those of Allies, where he was belore
coming to Grinneii.

The tables prepai‘éd by Mr. Rogers
include each group of men since he
came to Grinncli three years ago, and
those at Andes for several Seasons
back, and bring out the fact that Grim
nell students are younger in prepare
tion than thcse at Ames, and are also
smaller.

in 1920 there were no freshmen ex—,
amined, as against 142 in 1921 and 123'
in 1922. These men varied in height
from eo.2 inches in 1920, the shortest
in the three years, to 74.0 inches in
1920 also. The majority of the men
vary in height up to ﬁve feet. nine
inches, wlih,sa per cent of the men‘
under that height. This number has,
not been on the increase during the»

past three years. In Amos, in 1913,,|
the average height was given as five
feet, eight inches. This is consider--
ably over. our average. >

Weight allows for a great deal more

' fluctuation than height, with a. wide
variation over the three years. The
lightest freshnmu‘came to Grinneii in
1920, and weighed 92 pounds, whiie
the class of. 1926 claims the heaviest.
topping the scales at 325 pounds. This
accords for n percentage 0! 85 weigh-
ing less than 161 pounds, which is
practically the same as at Amer.

Age shows. the greatest difference
between ourselves and other schools.
The average worked out by Prof.
Rogers shows about a two year dif-
ference between Grinneli and Agnes

the class was 26 years and six months
of age; which decreased durlng two
