ANSWERING MR. KELLYt

[The constitution which has been
adopted has been subjected to all
kinds of criticism since it was ﬁrst
drawn up, but none of it has been so
lundamental or constructive as that
uttered by Joe Kelly. '22, in his com-
munication to the editor which we
publish today.

believe that’it can be fully met by
the new Court. ‘

Mr. Kelly points out that if the
new Court is to succeed it must be

corrective and constructive as well
as penal in its nature. We agree
with him fully. For this reason there
was a great deal of doubt as to
whether it should be callcd a “court"
or whether the traditional name of
“Oracle" should be retained. In view
or 'the present unpopularity of the
Oracle it was thought unwise to re
tain the panic. "Court," however.
docs not accurately describe the new
body which is to take the place of
the Oracle. ‘

The Court can and should be cur—
rective as well as penal. In fact,
the bulk of its work should consist
or just such 'activity as Mr. Kelly
recommends We believe, however,
that Kelly.does not fully appreciate
the fact that we are not setting up
an, open court. fl‘llere was agitation

for such a. body, but it is the belief

,of the Lantern that it would be,

worse than nothing under present
conditions. The Court can be either
open or closed at is own discretion,
according to the constitution. It is
expected that the majority of its
work will be done in secret sessions,
and it will not even be necessary to
call a man before the Court in order

to warn, reprimand, or help him in
any wily. We recum—
mend that the Court hold Open meet-
ings except in extreme Cases, and we
would never advise that publicity be

ever were. And iurthermore, it may
be admitted that every man got a

year with a roan like Kelly as chief
examiner and spokesman for the
Oracle, but how is the student body
to be absolutely assured that it will
continue to get a square deal herore
the Oraclc when it has nothing to
say about the personnel of that body?
No matter how lair the Oracle was

we know of men who think that they

is the objection which is met by the

JLFGOISM.

An editorial appearing in the Chi—
cago HeraldrExaminer about a month
ago seems to us to represent about
the worst type of American patriot—
isni and the best type of Jingoism
to be found anywhere. We therefore
quote some passages from it:

Great Britain had destroyed as many
American warships 9.5, without ﬁring
a gun or riskinﬂg a life, she destroyed
at the disarmament conference, it
would have been the greatest naval
victory in history.

nations! No more sacriﬁce behind

plc then the majority oi the college

do, any one Of these three things.

It is useless to try to point out
that the American people have been
saved millions of dollars as a result
of the disarmament conference; that
we have not lost one whit in our
relative standing as to armaments;
that, instead of being compelled to
disarm by Great Britain, we volun—
tarily scrapped our.o\i'n warships and

asked others to do the same; and

‘that the writer oi the above editorial

Dear Mr: Ed:

trny faith in it nor to detract in any
‘wzty from its chances for

me to contend for its continuation If
it has past its use. If anything I
want to add to the new idea. I have
not yet learned whether it has been
accepted, or campi‘rmised by the col-
lege. I do not think that element.

into the blackness oi the night, blind-

the Oracle. The honor of the men
