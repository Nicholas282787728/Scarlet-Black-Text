battled illl'lously with Walter McGrail.
and was the central ﬁgure in a mid»
night burglary in a, country home.

Filled With excitement and geared
up to high dramatic speed, “The In-

many Opportunities to arouse the ad—

He smiled upon death; he welcomed it

with open arms—until he found him— '

sell sitllng an an iron girder, twelve
stories in the air, and nothing to
grab hold or out the framework or n
skyscraper in the making! Lite then
