Friday

If President \ (till hfld chosen to give
a title to his rridsy morning chapel
talk he might have well called it “The
Youth Movement and College Criti-
cislll." Ac’cording to Mr, Main, the

outh movement is not a new thing,
lor it has always been "a charge of
dynamite in a. quiescent world.” More-
over, the recklessness and daring of
the present generation are merely (ales
mental qualities which were extant in
the dim ages of the past. “Had we
known the song that mocked the bald
ncss or Elﬁn. we could almost torgivc
the she—hears that came out of the
woods and devoured the rllfflatns."

"Now the world is more complex.
There are a thousand things to chalv
lengc the youth or todayrthizlgs that
require youth to he more resolute.
more tor-ward looklng, to reach the
goal of achievement.” Sneaking of
the modern craze for pleasure, Presir
dent Main said, “Pleasure is self-de—
structive, The toy ot life is only the
line tlowor that springs from the joy
or work and the advance to achieve-
merit."

Mr. Main believes that the my to do'
away with the criticism oi the higher
institutions of learning is to have ev-
ery student who enters college grnd<
ually but surely assimilate the idea
that studying is a respectable college
activity.

no discussion or its causes, and the
