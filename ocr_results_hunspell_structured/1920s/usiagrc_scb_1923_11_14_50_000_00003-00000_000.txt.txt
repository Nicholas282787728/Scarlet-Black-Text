Harriers Win One Meet And Lose
Another in Short Gross Coun-
try Schedule.

The crosswuntry
brought to a close early last week
with the home meet, which was won
by captain Meyers over the three mile
course.

The squad engaged in only two out-
side meets this season.
meet was run against Minnesota Uni-
versity over a five mile course. The
Minnesota squad had the best of the
deal in this meet and won by the
count at 17 to 34. . Meyers was the
iirst Grinnell man to finish, talsing
fourth place in the run.

The second contest was run against
the Blue and White Drake distance
men at Grinnell homecoming day.
The Pioneer barriers were more for-
tnnate in this meet and easily captur-
ed first place by a score of 25 to
34. Meyers broke the tape in this

_ meet with Howard close behind him.
In addition to, winning the race, Meyr
ers also broke the course record for
the five mile run.

Two men won letters during the
season just closed. Meyers and
Howard were the men to receive this
honor, both men having won them,
however, in last year's meets.

The season has been one or 'iair
success although Grinnell did not suc<
ceed in winning both meets. The
prospects for next season are zstill
more promising. Meyers, and How-
ard will still be in school in addition

0N AMERICANISM

Armistice Day Service Pleases
Unusual Audience Monday.

"By the stars in the service tins
above your heads," said Dr. Edward
A. Steiner in his address an the Arm»
istioe Day service in Herrick Chapel
Monday morning, “I bid you make
yourselves worthy of your America.
she's with living lorishe's worth
dying for!"

The general topic of Dr. Steiner's
talk was the mission of America. We
pride ourselves upon being a demcn
cratic nation, he reminded us, and
we must constantly guard against
personal prejudice and narrow-mind-
edness; for neither America. nor any
nation under the sun can be a true
democracy unless a iundamental spir»
it of tolerance is woven into the lire
and thought of the country. Dr.
Steiner told interestingly of many
rabidly critical letters he has received
after speaking berore various con-
ventions and assemblies throughout
the country.
