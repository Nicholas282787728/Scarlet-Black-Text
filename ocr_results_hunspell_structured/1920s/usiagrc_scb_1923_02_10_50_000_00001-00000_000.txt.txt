Play Given by Forum Phi-Delph
Suits Because of Unusual
Innovations Used.

"The Show Shop," which is a very
'rliflerent play from that usually seen
by'the average audience, was remark-
ably presented by the Forum-Phi—
Delph societies last night before a
crowded house.

The members of Forum-Phi Delph
under tbe direction of Homer Abegs
glen are to be congratulated in their,
effort to put an extremely difficult
play across. Farce, which is so de-
pendent upon the timing of entrances 1
,and exits, snappy dialogues, and univ-
mation m the extreme, is tbeunost
difﬁcultltype or play which amateurs
can attempt The very lines ot_the
play, the situations, all bring laughs,
but it takes perfection in detail to
make the laugh always without a cer-
1taip hollowuess. -
There is no question that the audi-

' ence at the Colonial theatre last night

enjoyed the production of“‘The Show
Shop." Hearty laughs, and enthusias-
Itic applause frequently congratulated
,the actors efforts. Perhaps it was
Harry Barnes its Max Rosenbuum, the
1Jewish producer, that pruvckedmuch
ol.’ the laughter. Surely be contributed
much to the success of the play‘, prob-
Iahly more than any one individual in
the cast. But besides provoking
ilaughter, Barnes did some real acting,
especially the one little bit Where he
‘anncunced the failure of the show.

Elli’iedc Corinne (IS Belly and Wal

den of the plot as the lovers Miss‘

sonatlity in llel‘ part, (ind she also

AN UNUSUAL INSPIRATION

Sixty C onglreg‘atiomtl Ministers
Hear Numerous Addresses
of Great Interest.

With the sixth Gates Memoiinl Lec-
turc Thursday evening, by Doctor
Sliﬂlll‘l‘ Mathews, the ninth annual
Fellowship Conference of the Con-
gl‘cgrttioniil ministers or Iowa. oonClul’lr

successlul gatheliug, its popularity
being attested by the fact that nearly

sixty v 11; clcrgymen registered,

IThc program wds this year or ex-

ceptional merit, and was attelided and
enioyed not only by the guests, but

by many Crumeli people and students.

Dr. Mathews anu'ortliy.

The addresses by Dr. Mathews were
particularly noteworthy. In addition
to his regular lectures, in the Gates
Memorial series, he gave three hours
in addition to the Conference, in
which time he spoke on Evangelism,
Spiritualizing the Work of the Church,

‘and answered any questions that the

visiting ministers propcnnded to him.
Upon being asked it a man could
preach the doctrines o1 Christianity
as he taught them, Dr. Mathews re
plied he not only. could, but should.
"People want men to be straight for.
ward " he said. "Two things are most
important: that men should not spend
their time preaching against things,
but should be constructive in their
criticism; and‘ that they should make
it clear that it is the religious ex-
perience itself that is important, and
not its theological interpretation.
That Dr. Matheivs’ addresses were

,most helpful are popular is attested

by the number of people who daily
Came to hear him; and the Confer-

,ence is indeed indebted and grateful
to him for his valuable services.

THE BROTHERHOOD ADDRESS
The solution of our present any

application of the principles of Jesus

Allen of Oak Park, Illinois, speaking
before the Community Brotherhood
Tuesday evening.

Ministers in attendance at the reh‘
lowship Conference were the guests
of the Brotherhood.

These with many others who gather-
ed to hear the massage made n. large
audience for Dr. Allen to address, us—
ing as his subject, “New 0Coasions~

lNew Duties.”

“Only when the perpetual antagon-
ism between labor and its employer:
is broken down by the spirit of Jesus
Christ,” said Dr. Allen, “will our in-
dustriitl problem be near solution."
This attitude of hate is illustrated, he
said by Certain parts of the preamble

1uf the constitution or the l. W, W

which states that capital and labor.
have nothing in common and by the
attitude of certain large corporations
in this country at the present time.

in order to bring the nations of the
world into closer human)! and under-
standing the speaker recommended
an enlargement of the church's mis-
sionary program. While business
men [were sending trade commissions
into foreign countn'es to introduce
their goods by chairing friendship
with the other peoples. he said that
it was many times almost impossible
to get these same men to see the
advisability ct using the same busi-
ness methods with Christianity.

No other race ever made so much
development in so short a time as the
black race, Dr. Allen said. They are
only two generations removed form
slavery and eight generations remov—

play itself was little complicated in
plot, much revolved around the char-
acter presentation, staging, and
grouping. The smge scene in Act in
with the stage hands was very well
done.
