Speedball

Although outplayed nearly three
quarters of the game, the Dibble hall
speedball team came out victor-ions in
the final speedball game of tiie sca—
son against Langan hall, Monday,
November 26. The championship
game, which ended 11 to 9 was the
closest game played this year and
was anybody-s game until the final
whistle blew.

Dibble hall got off to a flying start
and scored two field goals before
Langan was aware that the game had
started. However, Langan came back
stronger in the second quarter and
made a field goal while they held the
champions scoreless.

in the second half Langan showed
still hetter.form, and after Dibble
gained a point through a penalty
kick, Kent kicked a field goal making
the score 7—6, Close and spectacular
playing featured the rest of the third
quarter which ended 1079. Dibble
made one more point at the beginning
of the last period, and for the rest of
the game were obliged to play hard
defensive against Langan-s rushing
forwards. In the last half minute of
play Langan took the ball up the field
and tussled tor some time in front of
Dibble's goal, but failed to have the
necessary punch to drive it through.

is a house mother a part
of the organization of the
men's halls, or is she affiliated wilhl
the faculty? This is the pondereus"
question that has for a long time been
staring into the face of the editor of‘
the Cyclone. Should the house moth—
ers’ pictures appear in the annual
along with the coaching staff in Cer-'
man, Greek, Latin. and allied hardr:
ships, or should it he with the coach—‘
ed in the above penalties, The ques»‘
tion has finally been answered in the
affirmative. ’ i

-In other words, the p'ctures of the
house mothers will be p eed in both
sections. Much contemplation was
required before the decision was
reached. 'There was a major reason
why the house mothers should he
placed in each category. Certainly,
the house mother, living in the dorms
and being confidante for all the
troubles and joys and love affairs in
the hall is a large cog in the dormi-
tory organization.

on the other hand, don't the house
mothers sit at dinner with the faculty
at Prexy’s home, and aren't they
classified as faculty in the the herd
book?

Now, both students and faculty
will be satisfied with the picture ar-
rangement.

Question: Which school do you con.
sider to be the most logical to be inr
vited to join the Missouri Valley Con-
ierenee?

Ullutl lietttmt Marquette, because
they rate a little higher athletically
than some of the other schools coll»
sidered.

Howard Peck: it Oklahoma Aggies
stay in, Carleton should not be in»
vited; but if Oklahoma Aggies drop
out, then Carleton should be invited.

Donald Joiirsi Marquette, because
they already have athletic relations
with most M the schools in the con-
ference, and they are on a par with
them.

Tlioruell hurries: I'd like to see
Marquette invited because they are of
the right caliber.

They zil-

 

wnys show good sportsmanship and

cause it is considered to bc a very
this school.

[‘lllll'lO» Finis Marquette, because
we have had athletic relations with
them (or several years and they have
good teams and are equal to the oth-
