Much Speculation-

Back in 1906 Dr. P. E. Somers, of
the class of 1394, offered a. cup to the
class basketball team which won it

three times out of their four in school!

The first cup was woh by the class of
1309, and the second was won by the
class of 1911. Latterly not much has
been heard of the cup, but the class
of 1924 has one leg of the trophy

safely tucked away and are out this}

year to get another hold on the cup.

the most changes and was slower to
round into ﬁghting trim than the line.
Captainr Markley did not hit his stride
until the end of the season altho he
played good tootball when he ﬁnally
got under way. Fearing was one oz the
most consistent men in a backfield po-
sition and his return to the squad
next year will give the team a half

able. Walters and Truckenmiller,
