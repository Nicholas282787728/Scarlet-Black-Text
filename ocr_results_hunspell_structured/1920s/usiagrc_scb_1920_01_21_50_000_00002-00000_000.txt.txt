Lack of democracy is turtnei- evi-

less, illicit. are restricted to those who
can overcome the qualms of conscience
which might arise from doing a hasicly

At Grinnell the laws concerning}
dancing are fairly speciﬁc. At least‘
:they are deﬁnite enough to make cer—
Itaiu types or dances positively illcgal

‘and to designate others as within the
”ﬂaw.

Dances or the nature of those held;
at the K. P. and Longshore halls are;
generaly recognized as being under
the ban.
since the beginning of college in
the fall it has been the common gos-
sip of the campus that many students
were attending these dances or late‘

lic dances was a Grinnell "blue law”

nearly attested but among the student

Such a condition cannot help but re—
ilect upon those whose business‘ it is
to entorce the law.

It appears to he an extension at
dancing privileges to those who have
the lack oi principle which will allow
them to make use or their opportunity.
These privileges should be made
available to all or else they should be
denied to all.
