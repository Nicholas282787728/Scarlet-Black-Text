IShVT IT T00 liAm

There Is, on a certain Street called
Park, a certain library called Public
or Carnegie Or both; between the two
lies a side—walk, meant to walls on7
a neat cement sidewalk which turns
a neat soon-e corner, and leads up to
the portals Of learning.

But "the ways at college birds are
crooked ways, as any sage can tell;"
and from the steps oi the Park street
lihrary, at a straggling angle or forty—
Iive degrees, there leads a. barren, tell»
tale little path—wistful, dingy, brow-l
beaten—which once was grass; still
taintly recognizable as such, hut rap—’
idly going under. Eight out in the
lront yard, where all the company can'
see ii!

Isn’t it too bad?

_c,_.___
JUST A IHNUTE, PLEASE!

If you were a senior, it you had
sat patiently alter the
chapel every morning tor three years,

postluﬂe at

waiting tor other people to pass out
lirst; It, even now, with the dignity
of approaching Commencement almost
upon you, you turned to leave the

_ chapel only to find a horde o: fresh-
men casually stepping out into the
aisle, calmly blocking your path to
the door; ii, in spite of that hovering
halo of graduate dignity, you were
torced to bring up the rear forlornly
—lt you were a senior, don’t you thinlr
it might "rile" you a little?

For a good many years there has
heen a detinite it unwritten tradition
in regard to the seating arrangements
at chapel and the order of leaving the
building atter the
from their iront seats, pass out first:
juniors second, and so on.

For he it train the Scarlet and Black
to stand pat behind a tradition mere-
ly because it happens to he a tradition.
In this case. however, the traditional

sel'vice:‘ seniors,

method happens to be decidedly more
The chapel can be emp-
lied quickly and efficiently if the
audience is allowed to pass out in an
orderly mhnner. Under the present
system, by the time you reach the yes-
tibule door—ll you are a senior—you
are: pawlng {or your pocketbook, ready
to buy a ticket to nigger-heaven.

So why not stand back, give your
upper class iriends a chance—they'll
wait :or you outsid and talre your
turn-z By way or consolation, we re~
sort to the time-honored refrain.
"There, little ireshman, dont you cry!
You'll he a Seniori‘by and by!"

GOLF BAG and set

OF CLUBS that Jim

HAD JUST put there on

ALL READY to show

THEM to her the

COULD, and just then

I NOTICED her pull

HER HAT .a little lower

ON ONE SIDE, and tuck

A CURL lNTo a little

AND THEN she did something
WITH A LITTLE vanity case
AND I tumbled then that
SHE HAD not even

SEEN what wins in
