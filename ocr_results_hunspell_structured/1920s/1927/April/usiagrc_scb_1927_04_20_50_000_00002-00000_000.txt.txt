VOLUME x iv.
sPhIV‘G CLEANING.

The spring renovation of campus organizations, with
their election of new officers and addition of new mem—
bers, marks a beginning of more immediate signiﬁcance
than the conventional date which tradition sets for the
turning of a new leaf. It is now. and not on the eve
of bell—ringing and merrymaking, that Grinueli makes
its start upon a new year. it is now that plans and
preparations are being made, hopes formed, and ideals
visualized for the year 1927—23. if resolutions are not
seasonable, at least there is no time more propitious
ior an analysis of the motives and policies with which
we intend to meet the coming year.

or primary importance is an appreciation of the
value of a constructive attitude. Not that sincere cri -
cisin of any kind is not valuable and highly desirable for
any college organization, but rather that the constant
rassumption oi the critical pose is entirely incompatible
‘with prog- s. ' One cannot destroy and, build"s_luiul—

'Xianeausl‘y‘. 'The‘ fpermanent value‘ of criticism which
oifers nothing"better than the object of its denunciation
is highly doubtful.

0f no less signiﬁcance than the constructive attitude
is the necessity for originality and initiatvie. With the
advent of each new administration there is an era of
high hopes and noble resolutions which soon give way.
’however, under the blows of actual experience. Then
there follows a stoiid acceptance of the old order or
things, a teeliug of "They didn’t do any better than this
last yezriwhy should we?" Thetendency to gravitate
is natural, but it is also deadly; only the exertion oi cop-

,is gssolttial In the best interests of athletics and especi-

, od
’ tithe question alone.

and or gual eiio mates possible a lift out of
the rut that last year‘s whccls have leit.

The campus organizations have undergone their
annual spring cleaning and are spick and span for a
new start. The little dust that may settle during the
summer can speedily be whisked away next (all, and then
the ability of the new occupants, both as housekeepers
and as builders, will he put to the true and ﬁnal test.

110)Y 0R “G".

Our recent acquisition of a swimiiig pool is in keep-
ing with the Grinnell college purpose of making it pus-
sible for an increasing number of students to get recre»
ational exercise in an individual, enjoyable way. It has
opened tip a ﬁeld of sport to a group of students who
can dei-ire its possible benefits through no other medium.

At the same time it has opened tip an old wound, for
again the question oi awardrrecognition is raised, in
this case the whole trouble being precipitated around
three vital problems: ﬁrst, should recognition be given
to swimming as an intercollegiate sport along with foot-
ball, basketball, track and tennis; second, what type of
award is in the interest of participants and general stu-
dcut body (centering around "major" or “minor" sports
letters); and third, what requirement for an award is
most beneﬁcial for the promotion of the sport and the
development ot those taking part. Other sports besides
those already inaugurated on our campus are in enthusi-
astic swing at other schools and will undoubtedly experi—
ence the same rise to favor here in years to come that
basketball, football and tennis have in the past.

We believe that everyone will agree that swimming
should be given some sort of recognition in order to
encourage aspirants in this realm oi physical activity.
Unless it is acknowledged as such in Gi-innell, swim-
ming will never attain its full usefulness as the sport
avowed as being the most conducive to all-around de-'
ielonmcut

If there are to be swimming meets on our intercol-
legiate schedule, then certainly there should be recogni
tion of swimming in the same way that basketball, track,
tennis and football are recognized. Who can say that
basketball. or football or any of the others are to be
considered as slightly superior to its comrades on the
athletic card and that all the others are to he subservient
to it? it‘ is true that in some schools so-called “major"
and “minor" letters are given in each sport but in a col-
lege the size of Grinnell this would not be advisable.
in the interest of the sport itself then, we advocate not
differentiation as to an arbitrary “major" or "minor"
sport, but recognition or swimming on an equality with
the present incumbents as an intercolegiate vehtlure.

Thirdy, we would like to see the requirements for
winning an Honor “G" slightly raised so that the obtain
ing of one would mean even more than it does now. This

ally'of the respect accorded it by the general student
‘ An entire editorial could be devoted to this phase

In a; short time a number of Sports will be clamoring
for admittance to the athletic curriculum, and rightly,
too. Fencing, boxing, golf, handball, and others (contin-
gent upon the highly hypothetical, but none the less
real construction of a new ﬁeld house) Will some day
have risen to the place of the present group. When
they do appear, a policy carefully formulated by consid-
eration of the interests of the greatest number of students
will help to elevate Grinnell to a new field of pioneer
service. —Tbeodore Lovejoy.

authorship of Ralph Smileyr Walter
lngram. and Betty hinge, last year’s
students who have worked upon the
subject. They have tirade wax models

by piecing together one hundred and

The discovery. of the position and
shape of the muscle was made last
