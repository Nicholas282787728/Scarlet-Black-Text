l Campus Opinion

Do you apnrule of the l'eqllirt'lllent
that two or more house parties must
he held on the sump N‘L‘nillgl

Eleanor Dilutou—I think it lends a
more democratic atmosphere to have
more than one party on the same
night because it gives more heonle a
chance to go

Jerry Ilriuku n—It‘s all right with
me. But conflicting dates hare been
known to occur because oi the re-
nuirement.

Kai-old Colhﬂl‘lﬁNo, I'm opposed to
grouping them as they are. It bunchr
es the social chairs of the school too
much.

Miss Harriett Knglilii'Yes, I do. The
more parties we hare, the more people
will be nble to take part in them. I
believe it helps to make for greater
happiness in both quadrangle and dor—
mitcry, if more people take part in
the social amirs.

Donald FessleriYes, tor no good
reason at all.

Mal-met NapieriI think it‘s better
to have just one party a night be—
cause it lessens competition and would
not upset the usual social activities of
other people in school so much.

Dean J. F. rilidlayailes, i think it
solved a problem last year that
couldn’t otherwise have been solved.
‘Vlth any other plan there Wouldn’t
be enough nights to go around.

Christine Lorelm—No, I do not. be~
cause you can't always get the guest
list you want.

George DIODrkX’es, it's a good idea
because it tends to discourage Con-
flioting social events, and makes the
evening a. little "bigger” all around.

Alice L0choy~lt would be better to
have only one party at a time, and so
somewhat extend the social atfairs of
the school.

Mr. Orville Beeleril think it's a
good idea to try to entertain every-
body by having several parties on the
same evening because everybody needs
it in this town.

George M. Hihbits, ’21, who has been
connected with the department of
niusic at onto Wesleyan college has
been elected director or music at

Mary Braginton, '20, who has been
teaching Latin at Mount Holyoke
college will be professor of Latin and
Green at Rockford college~Grinnell
