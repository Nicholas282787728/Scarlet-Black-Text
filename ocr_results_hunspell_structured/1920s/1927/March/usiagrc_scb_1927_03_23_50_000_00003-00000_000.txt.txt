merit, in moments of joy and
gaiety, a lighted Camel will spur
you to the stars with its cool,
crisp ﬁre. Camels understand your
every mood.

A purchase of Camels brings
you the choicest Turkish and
Domestic tobaccos. Blended by
skilful experts into the world’s
most popular smoke, and the best.

Unfathomed quality is the distin-
guishing mark of Camel.

No' matter what the price you
pay, you can buy no better ciga-
rettes than Camels. Smoke them
as frequently as you please. You
will never be left with a cigaretty
after-taste; Camels aren’t made
that way. That is why experienced
smokers everywhere demand them.
That is why millions thrill to three

short words: "Have a Camel!”
