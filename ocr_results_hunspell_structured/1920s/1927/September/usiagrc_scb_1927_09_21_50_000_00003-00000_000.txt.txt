APPRECIATION OF ART 231.
We are all for bigger and better
impromptu drnmatics. Always did
like that “Russian Lullaby" anyway.
But then, one can’t he a disconsolate
father all the time, you know.

The title of “Rolled stockings" was
rather deceiving. You see, they were
all rolled up and not down. Anyway,
all the freshmen know What college is
like now.

Pome Number One

I've seen a lady named Alice

(Have you heard about lien)
With the lips or .1 beautiful chalice

(Doesn't that rhyme nicely?)
She danced out hetore us

(There's really one one of me)
In it six—legged chorus

(Oh boy!)
on, what a centipede is Alice!

‘ No offense, Alice. You know darn
well that a centi-pede has more than
six legs, and besides Martha and Mil-
dred were there too. Quite.

Anyway she knows how to get into
the library.

Luuise Barton has a yapping pock—
et-book dog. She is going to call it
Do-Duugh.

AND GET/A RED NOSE.

Ticky Smith and Evenor Bradley
have a bet on tile Dempseerunney
tight tomorrow night, which is nothing
unusual. But if Tunney wins, Evenor
rolls a peanut from Smith to Dibble
hall: it Dempsey wins, Ticky does the
same. This is just to let the Court
know that neither of them will have
been drinking.

Even though we haven’t been to the
bull tight, we've picked up a lot of
sore.

All of which leads up the point
'that the new Butcher song is; "Butch-
er Arms Where They Belong."
