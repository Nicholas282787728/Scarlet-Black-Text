James Mulroy. reporter for Ille Chis
cage Dai NEWS and winner of
the Pulitzer prize ill 1924 for his ser-
vices in reporting and gaining el'ir
dence in the Loch-Leopold murder
case, will be one of the chief speakers
at ille eighth annual convention of tile
Iowa High School Press association to
he held in Grippell December 2 arid 3.
This announcement was made lil'
Way no Gard today, permanent secrer
tary of the association

Mr. .liulro , who in 192i was a cup
reporter on the Chicago Daily NEWS,
has risen to the position of star
reporter on that publication through
his ability to gather evidence and re-
port important stories

In May 1924, Mr. Mulroy and Alv-in
H. Goldstein, who had been working
together as cub reporters on the NEWS
were sent out to run down a story of
the kidnapping of a young boy nalued
Robert Franks, Jr. The two reporters
went to the home of Robert Franks,
father of the boy, where Mr. Franks
showed the reporters a biacifmailins
letter which he had received, stating
that the kidnapped boy would be re-
turned for 510.000.

Link Up Stories.

On the same afternoon there appear-7
ed a news story on the finding of the
body of a murdered boy in another
part of the city. With this informa-
tion the two reporters began to link
the two stories together. As a, result
Molroy went to the Franks' home and
sent a photograph of Robert Franks Jr.
to Goldstein, who had gone to attempt
to identify the body.

while the police searched for the
murderer of the boy the two reporters
sought to gain evidence in the case.
From a talk with Loeb it was disclosed
that he knew more about the case than
he could learn from stories in the
newspapers. With this evidence it was
sought to determine Whether the black
mailing note had been Written on the
typewriter belonging to Leopold which
had been found at the edge of a. lake.
By gaining samples of the typewrit—
ing of Loeb and Leopold from Irlends
of the two men it was established that
the note had been written on the type-
Writer belonging to Leopold.

Police Follow Clues.

With this evidence the police were
able to follow up and gain additional
evidence and Loch and Leopold were
found guilty in the courts on a charge
of murdering Bobby Franks .lr.

For their services in gaining evi»
dence in this case both Mr, Goldstein
and Mr, Mulroy received a reward of
51,500. A year later the Pulitzer prize
of $1,000 was awarded to each of the
two reporters for the best example of
news reporting that year.

During the time that Mr, Mulroy has
been with the NEWS he has been the
editor of several magazine articles on
crime, one of which was an article on
gang wars in the September issue of
Plain Talk. Mr. Mulroy will de-
liver his address in Grinnell at three
o'clock on the afternoon of December
2.

Flans for the speeches, round tables,
and entertainment at the convention
are nearly complete.

Replies from high schools from all

Register Editor Makes Plea 0n
Grounds of Plausibility
Here Sunday.

“Why shouldn’t we be willing to
stand by the World Court and the
League of nations. It would be enor<
mously to our advantage to support
the settlement of disputes by judicial
procedure since it is the very basis on
which our society rests," said Harvey

GISTER in his open forum lecture
SUNDAY evening at the high school
'auditorium.

air. lngham who recently reunited
from Europe where he had made a.
study of the international siuation. op~
ened his address with a discussion of
the various problems facing Europe
today.

“A thousand years of history, of
monuments commemorating victories
over each other, of wars, are against
the wiping out of boundary lines be—
tween the countries of Europe and the
unification of the Continent," said Mr.
lngham. “The ,drink problem is .1
great one involving A Waste of an
enormous amount of time and resnllr-
ces on liquor, England alone can»
sumes one and a halt billions of dol-
lars worth of liquor. Liquor in Eur-
ope is used as a sopofol'ic, it keeps the
people sleepy and contented,“

Every Job Taken.

“The people in Europe have their
work distributed so all can do lldnd
Work enough to earn a llvln : ulB'KI,
is no chance to shift, every job is full;
and hand labor will not be displaced
by machinery," commenter] Mr. Ing-
ham with regard to the labor situation.

When questioned regarding the Eur-
opean sentiment toward the League
of Nations, Mr. Ingham replied: "The
sentiment toward the league is, enor-
mously favorable. The leaders of Eur-
ope today are determinedthat there
must not be another war. The last
session of the League was more suc-
ce ful than any of the previous ones

The \Vorld Court has enough cases
dockcted to require the entire time of
the justices of the Court of Interna~
tional justice for the next session. The
Court has gained tremendously with
every question settled. If ten more
years of adjudicating disputes can he
added to these successful years, the
court will become the recognized um—
Dire in World disputes."

Answers Questions.

Varied questioning elicited the role
lowing comments from Mr. fngham:

“There is a general feeling of ad-
miration for America in Europe, ev»
erythlng adopted is patterned after u ,
but on the other hand, Europe is tr -
mendonsly peeved because we are col-
lecting debts from them and sitting
back and making money."

"The Trotsky group in Russia is
gradually dropping out and the con-
trol is coming into the hands of a sta-
bi zed people who are developing
Rlls id's own resources."

"One of the best developments in
Europe is the institution of compul-
sory education,"

"Europe would like an agreement
froln us that we will not interfere by
insisting on neutral rights of trade
with aggressive peoples."

and German papers are merely bullc-
tins.

"There is no [l'oedolu of the press as
we know it. For example: I walked

"The countries are so thickly popu—
latefl that there is not the demand for
men which we have. Occasionally a
mail from the peasant class gets ahead,
but practically all of the men in the
profession are from the higher classes,
Every peasant family makes it a point
to send one child to college; they can
do it only by sacrificing every thing,
and naturally they send the most brile
lialll Child, and some at them get to
the top. As a whole the men are bet
tcl' trained for their Work than Ameri-
can men.”

then asked about university schools
of journalism, of which there are nine
in Germany, Mr. Ingham said, "I heard
nothing about professional schools of
journalism, but I presume that some
of the larger universities have them.
Most reporter obtain their journalistic
training through expercnce after they
have had a. liberal arts education.
They usually begin as reporters and
travel from one capital to another and
finally work up on one newspaper.

Carl-y No Advertising.

'fThere is no advertising in continenr
tal newspapers as there is in our
American dailies. As I said, they ,are
maintained by subsidies and are inde-
pendent of advertising." The reporter
asked What replaced newspaper ad-
vortsing and Mr. Ingham said, “No-
thing. They sell in limited areas and
their stores have been established
since the year one anyway. Just as you
or I would stop in at Marshall Field’s
in Chicago or go to Tiffany’s,” we
were in New York. They are estab-
lished stores; we know about them and
would know about them if we never
read about them in the newspapers.

“The London TIMES is, of course,
the best newspaper in the world. There
is none like it. All English newspa-
pers have enormous circulations, and
are far superior to the papers of any
other European country. The TIMES
alone, has a. circulation or 1,700,000."
Mr. Ingham wouldn't venture to make
even an estimate of the number of
editions which the large papers had
each day, but he did sa , ”or course,
there is no spot news and no need [or

the many editions which our papers
have."

Saturday’s Game With Iowa State
Is Last Chance to Capture
Gridiron Contest.

Gl‘innell's last chance this your to
break into the win column comes this
Saturday when the Pioneers meet the
Ames Cyclones in the season closer
for the Scarlet and Black warriors.

Gl'illnell’s chances of winning or we
ing in this encounter received a boost
when it was aunouuccd that Johnny-
Miller, the biggest Ames direct would
have to undergo an operation on his
knee, and would lie uuallle to play in
the R'ﬂme.

In the Washington game, last Sat-
urday, {he Glinucll team showed an
improvement in its dcfcnse against
and runs. The placing of Liedilie at
end seems to have solved the cud
problem which has been before, Grill-
llcll all season. However, the orilmell
defense against passes was somewhat
erratic and the Bears gained most of
their yardage by this means.

against the Bears and played one of
the best games that he has all season.
He will lie in the lineup which starts
against the Cyclones and it is doubtful
whether the Ames hacks will be able

him. Kliuefelter, who has suffered

last Saturday against the Bears, held
up his Wing like a. veteran and it is
probable that he will continue to act in
this capacity for the Ames game.

be a simple matter. Such, however, is
noi. the case. One player, perhaps a.
star in Smith hall, might suffer a.
severe let—down in the Clark ball

taken into consideration when the
problem is tackled.

This year's SCARLET AND BLACK

that is yearly heaped upon the head of

his teams, or because there are too
many men from one certain building.

The race this year was again a
Walkroff for the Dipble hull team,
which banished all opposition, scoring
96 points to the total of 22 for all
others. This far eclipses any previous
scoring record of the last four years
since speedball was inaugurated as an
intramural sport. A practically veter»
on team built around Harris (Jogge-
shell, the Courthouse eleven proceed<
ed to will all of its games by dint of
a hard driving offense which kept con-
(mi of the ball during the greater
portion of all the games.

in selecting Coggeshall as a for—
ward on the mythical team, little mis—
take can be made. The Dibble leader
led all other scorers by a wide margin,
and was the mainspring of the Six or.
fense. Smiley, a. teammate is picked
likewise for his scoring ability. ret—

Clifford of Three are a pair of flashy

and Peterson.

Eddie Brown, . ilt Cohen, and Ted

hack posts, each being an cotstendlng
member of his team. Brown appeared
to be the best bet of the lot, being
largely responsible for driving the ball
down the field to his high-scoring for-
wards. Cohen, led the Stable team in
a fine manner, and was the most row-
erful kicker m the series. Lovejoy
continually drove the opposition back
from the Smith goal with fine kicks,
and in addition speeded up the offense
when necessary. Loveloy was entirely
responsible for Smith's upset victory
over the stable team.

George Gains, and Donald (Jihby)
Jones are picked as first string lull~
hacks. Gains was a battler cf the
pest type, mixing in every ploy. con-
stantly driving the hall deep into the

In addition he was an ironicast on de~
