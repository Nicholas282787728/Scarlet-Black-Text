Asserts Peak Can Be Climbed With
Knowledge Made Available
By 1924 Expedition

Illustrates Lecture Last Night
With Photographs Taken
On Record Climb.

“An expedition of the near future
can, in all probability, conquer the last
800 feet of Mt. Everest, aided by the
knowledge made available by the 1924
expedition, which approached within
this distance of the summit," asserted
Captain John 13. Noel, British explor.
er and photographer, in opening the
college lecture course last evening in
the Congregational church with a lees
ture "0n the Roof of the World" illus-
trated with rare photographs of the
ascent of the peak and of the people
of Tibet. He was introduced by Prof.
E. 13. T. Spencer.

Residing in india belui'e the World
war, Captain Noel personally made
three attempts to scale the world's
highest mountain, reaching a record~
breaking height in 1913. Because of
these experiences, he was chosen to
have charge of the photography in the
1922 and 1924 expeditions.

Three Attempts since War.

Led by a love of adventure and a
desire to carry one step further man's
conquest of nature, men have made
three attempts to climb this peak since
the war, stated the explorer, 1021, 1922
and me. it was not until 1921 that
Tibet, from which country the ascent
is made, would permit these expedlr
tions of foreigners to enter the coun-
try. The first one was purely geogra—
phical, the main discovery being that
the northeast ridge was the only way
by which man may reach the summit
of Mr. Everest,

“With a previous altitude record of
24,600 feet to spur us on. the twelve
white men and sixty natives, aided by
packmules. began the ascent early in
the year 1924," related Captain Noel.
"The base of the mountain was luxur-
iant with every kind of animal, tree
and plant life, while at a height of
from 8.000 to 10,000 feet were open
valleys, numerous villages and george—
ous flowers." »

“At an altitude of 15,00b feet the ex-
pedition came onto the plateau of
Tibet, inhabited by a nomadic and
primitive people. Living in a climate
contrasting extreme heat and cold,
they dress in crudely spun cloth and
skins, wear freakish head—dresses. ear-
rings and charms, many beautifully
carved. Their welcome to strangers
consists in extending their tongues.

Prom-l 011 Foot.

\ Shortly after the expedition left the
people of Tibet, stated the speaker, it
came to the edge of the ice. at a
height of 16,400 feet, where the mules
were left and the company proceeded
on foot. For four weeks camps were
built along the path to the summit.
five miles apart and each 2,000 feet
above the other, the largest and base
camp being at a height of 21,000 feet.

Contendlng against an atmosphere
so rarefied that doctors had warned
the ,expedition before starting that
they thought life impossible in it,
against a perpetual west wind of a
velocity of n hundred miles an hour,
xgalnsl great distaste for food, against
a blinding sun and an ice ridge a
thousand feet high and against count-
less other obstacles, the expedition
struggled foot by foot to a point 27.—
000 feet above sea level, where the
final camp was made on an ice ridge.

The cameras had been left at an al—
ﬁtnde of 22,000 feet and all photo»
graphs of higher points were taken
from this place by a telescopic lens.
The pictures were shown last night.

Two Men Lose Lives.

"From the camp on the ice ridge five
attempts were made to scale the peak,"
captain Noel continued. “The first,
without an artificial supply of oxygen,
was undertaken by Somervell and
Norton, the latter of whom reached
28,000 feet before collapsing. Finally.
with a supply of oxygen sufficient for
forty hours, Mallory and 1rvine reach-

Trustee Finds Franklin Clock and
Library ‘Big’ Bill’s Tainted Books

Grinncll indirectly finds itself owner
of valuable and pseudo-valuable an»
tinues; a trustee discovers a clock, the
library some stigmatized books.

A clock made by Benjamin Franklin
and believed to be one of the only two
clocks mantactured by the great/int»
cricau patriot and inventor, has re-
cently been found by George M. Bechr
tel, trustee of Grinncll college and
Davenport bond merchant, among his
family possessions.

A clockinaker immediately went to
the Davenport public library and se-
cured a com‘ of “Franklin's Memoirs."

In these memoirs, Franklin states
that he made two clocks as one of the
indications of his versatile genius, it
is believed that the lock discovered
here today is one of these tw

The timepiece is a large wall clock
of the grandfather type set in a solid

walnut frame. it was originally in the
possession of Mr. EechLel’s maternal
grandfather, David Steeher, who was
born in Pennsylvania not far from
Philadelphia, before the year 1800.

Three volumes contained in the
Crinnell college, library have been
stigmatixed by U. J. (Sport) Herrmann,
agent of Mayor Thompson of Chicago
in the Chicago administration's foray
against biased books in the public lib—
raries of that city.

cvery college and high school library

Badger Team Next
On Pioneers’ List

Grinhell Will Meet Wisconsin At
Madison Saturday; Sq'uad Is
In Fair Condition.

With games against the best Valley
school and one or two non»conference
teams of consequence at her back.
Grinnell turns to the Big Ten fee of
her schedule a la Notre Dame. What
she does and how she does it against
the University of Wisconsin is the next
question in the minds of Pioneer pa-
triots.

The Big Ten team has a fine record
this season, the high peak being her
showing against Minnesota, the prob-
able champion of that conference. She
held the Gophers to a one touchdown
victory. This record, while it indicates
Badger power, maybe a factor favor-
ing the Pioneers this week. The Mad
isoo boys may be willing to rest on
their laurels when they meet Satur-
day’s opponent, which is considered
weak in comparison with past foes.
The local warriors, however, will be
keyed for a powerful competitor and
will be anxious to make a. showing.

Crofoot Cluof Cog.

Mr. Crofoot, who acts as captain.
passer, ball carrier and punter for
Wisconsin, is the chief cog in the
Badger machinery which must be
Evahn, the local kicker.
may be one of the biggest monkey—
wrenches, since his toe work this year
has averaged from ten to fifteen yards
better than Crofoot’s.

The foreigners are not entirely de-
pendent ‘on their star when they trot
onto the field. Besides ten other first
string performers they have four or
five other teams which make their
coach look twice before he decides
which is best.

Trouncing Big Ten fees is the style
in the Missouri Valley this year. 'Mis-
souri scored much and often against
Northwestern; Ames held illinols to
a tie score; the Oklahoma Sooners
gave Chicago university more than
she wanted; and the only reason Ne-
braska hasn't a Big Ten scalp or two
at her belt is because she can't sched~
nle games in that conference since she
whipped illinois in 1925.

Clcland Injured.

One of the chief problems which
faces Coach Watt this week is finding
a man to replace Ray Cleland. the twm
hundred pound guard who chipped a
bone in his shoulder in the Milwaukee
tiff, There are several possible solu-
tions, none of which are satisfactory.
Perhaps the most plausible one is to
put Kiesel in the vacant position.
Kiesel is large and a fairly hard bitter.

Brooke may receive the call, al-
though Watt will think twice before
giving up his best substitute tackle.
Arthur is another possibility. Al-
though he is small he can stand pun-
ishment and knows something of the
gentle profession of using the hands.

Whether Klinefelter's ankle will al—
low him to resume his place at right
tackle is a question on which hangs
much of the strength in the right side
of the line. If he is unable to play,
the combination used against Mar.
qusttc will be favored. Bradley, the
regular center will be shifted to
’eckle and Heldiidge Will take his
place in the middle of the line.

The injury to Rose’s shoulder was
somewhat bruised in the last game,
but not enough to lnterlere with his

 

work at Madison. Fall’s ankle was al~

Girls Are Held Up
In Botany Gardens;
Police Guard Place

Two sophomore and several fresh»
man girls were held up in the Botany
gardens by unknown persons last
week. The men demanded money of
the freshmen, but otherwise nothing
serious resulted.

Since that time a member 01' the
Grinnell police department has been
stationed in the gardens, but there
have been no further developments. M
The police state that the parties are
known and will probably be arrested in
in the near future, They express con- m
fidence that such an affair will not be
repeated. ,

Rumors to the effect that there [a
were holdups in the gardens have been m
rife for some time upon the campus,
but the police have just‘released the‘
authentic story today.

Capture Bold,

Not every col-eds has had the Oppor-

tunity for adventure, publicity and so-

nl service that was offered to two

of the most reticent quad-dwellers. In

ct, they are so shy that they refuse
reveal any of the facts. However,

what we can gather from sleeprtalklng,
incoherent mumblings at the dinner

bio, and songs in the bathrtub, is that.

there are a couple highwaymeh at
large In the Jardins de Botanlque, and
whet is more, these demure malfls had
the chance to assist ln {helr capture
and refused it!

This is the tale that we have gleaned
0m [lie remarks of the two coeds,

and it is here stated in their own

ords—as far as possible:

"Very dark night. No, it Wasn’t

raining . Walking along the railroad

ack looking for live dollars, Yes, We

had lost it The Grlnnall police force
came up and spoke to us. He showed
us his star, and asked us what we

finding things. So, by way of divers
sion, he suggested that we return the
courtesy and help him in his official
duties. It seemed that the simple, lit-
tle plan was this: We were to walk
through the Botanical Gardens‘fas he
called them), and if no one Jumped out
and said ‘Boo!’ or ‘Hftltl' we were to
wait until some one did—perhaps even
wblstle sllghlly to lure them. If any-
one did pop out, we were to bowl like
squirrels, and the police force Would
come tearing to our assistance."

From this point the story grows
more and more vague. It bedtime prac-
tically impossible to understand their
sleep-talk because of snoring room—
mates; ln the dining-room a tray was
dropped at the time of ll very import-
ant utterance; and even the bathing
song was interrupted by the annoyinz
splash of a shower. But We gathered
from one gentle remark that the gll'ls
were ethically sound if not heroically
inclined. "We would have done 1:."

Pioneers Flash Brilliant Attack
Which Takes Marquette Off
Feet First Quarter.

FIRST PERIOD SCORELESS.

Golden Avalanche Lives Up To
Name Beginning With the
Second Quintet.

After ﬂashing a brilliant attack
which took the Marquette gridsters off
their feet in the first quarter, Grinncll
fell by the wayside and was defeated
31 to 0 by the Golden Avalanche squad.
Marquette got revenge for their last
year’s defeat at the hands of the Pin-
neers. saturday was the Milwaukee
team's homecoming.

During the opening quarter the Pio-
neers outgaiued the Avalanche 51
yards to 22, but failed to score. Grin-
nell reccived the kick-off on their own
5 yard line and Erahn returned it
20 yards. 011 the first play after the
kickoff, Rose broke away around Mara
quette’s right end for 25 yards and a
first down at midfield. The Marquette
line held and Evahn punted t2 yards
against the wind to Marquette's 3 yard
line where the hall rolled outside.
Marquette failed to gain, and Leary
punted back 21 yards to his own 33
yard line. Evalln was held at the
line, and then Lietdke broke away
through the Marquette line for a 13 .
yard run to lilarquette's 20 yard line. ’
Here the Avalanche held for downs,
and took the hall. The remainder of the

quarter was funght on fairly even
terms.

Geliert Scores First.
Beginning with the start of the sec-
ond quarter, the Marquette team began
to live up to its nickname, the Golden
Avalanche. “Swede" Gehert scored
Marquette's ﬁrst touchdown on a
beautiful so yard run after a driving
line attack had brought the ball to
Grinnell's 35 yard line. Toward the
end of the same period, Gebert scored
another touchdown on a short end run
after the Marquette backs hsd alter-
nated in carrying the ball on s series
of line bucks to Grinnell’s 6 yard line.

Marquette scored again in the third
quarter on Waschick's pass to Ander-
son who ran ten yards for a touch—
down, Maruuette scored twice in the
final quarter. The first touchdown of
the quarter was made after a Grin-
nell punt had been partially blocked.
and recovered by Marquette on Grin-
hell's 24 yard line. A series of line
plays by Waschick and McQuasney
brought the ball over to the 1 yard line
from where Waschick plunged over,
for the touchdown. The Avalanches
final touchdown was made by Lukas,
after the hall had been carried right
down the field by straight football.

Grinuell Threatens.

Late in the fourth quarter, Grinnell
threatened to score when Klngery in-
tercepted Gebert’s pass and ran
through a broken field to Marquette's
35 yard line. However, the Pioneers
lost the ball on downs and Marquette
punted out of danger as the game end-
ed.

Evahn averaged 39 yards on punts
against a 29 yard average by Leary
and Dunn of Marquette. This average
also includes one punt which was par—
tially blocked. Rose was perhaps the
most outstanding player for Grinuell,
while Gebert and Leary shone the
brightest for Marquette. The lineup:
