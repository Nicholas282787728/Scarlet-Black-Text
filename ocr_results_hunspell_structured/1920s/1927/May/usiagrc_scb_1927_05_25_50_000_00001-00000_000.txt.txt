events the results in the summary are
credited to buildings rather than til

Likes Contributions by Authors
Who now Subjects About
Which They Write.

By Curtis Lamb

In this day of such advice to the
young ccrivnin as, “It’s not what you
write, but how you write it," it is com-
forting to pick up the July TnNASER
and find it filled with contributions
inspired by knowledge of the subject
in hand. It may not be the absolute
test of literary merit that the author-
should be acquainted with his subject,
but it is pleasing to the reader to
find articles, stories and sketches by
men who know whereof, they speak.

Jose . guel Bejarano, secretary of
the Mexican Chamber of Commerce,
heads the list *of contributors with
"Dollar Diplomacy in Nicaragua," in
which Mexican and American political
ideals are contrasted with the balance
distinctly credited to our. sister re»
public. Discountenancing American
interference in not only Nicaraguan
but Mexican affairs, Mr. Bejarano
ironically states that “The heroic Re-
public of Mexico has committed the
unpardonahlc sin of enacting and en;
forcing laws to its liking, adapted to
its necessities and conducive to its
advancement."

Bentley's Story Realistic

Harold Bentley presents the kind of
realism in "Broken Threads" that
brings child labor legislation for hu-
manity's sake in an age of material-
ism. Hlniself o. weaver for several
years in an English cotton mill, now
as a Grinnell college student, he
writes vividly of tbc industrial debut
of a lad of twelve who may have been
rightly named Bentleyiwllo knows?

Discardiiig Matthew Arnold's “high
seriousness” of literature, Wayne
Gard in an “Editorial,” stands firmly
with Joel E. Spinga‘rn, modern crltlc,
in dcriding “This confusion of moral
and artistic values." Mr. Gard won-
dcrs that despite the critics, the read-
mg public demands that art be kept
within certain moral bounds. in ally~
ing himself with Spingnrn, thc‘ TAN-
hGElt editor is playing with fire.
Does he forget that the moral rule is
but a small part of the program Mr.
Spingarn has outlined of throwing all
standards for creation, apprcciation
and criticism to the Winds? will Mr.
Gard go the whole way, declaring that
our age is fundamentally different,
licing composed primarily of original
geniuses for whom there is no rule.
no standard, no doctrines of reason
and universal consent?

Coggeshall Takes
Valley Net Title

Annexes Singles to Win the First
Valley Championship For
Pioneer School.

Hai-i . Coggeshall, versatile sopho-
more at Gl‘innell, walked throllgll tllE
Missouri Vitllcy singles tournament at
Lincoln on Friday and Saturday to
win the Valley championship. This
is the first Valley championship to be
held by the Pioneer school since its
entrance into the conference in 1919.
Cuggeshall defeated Lauren Barn ‘,
Oklahoma. Aggie star in four sets, W2,
(H, 3.6, ms.

In marching to the finals the Grin-
nell player conquered several of the
leading players in the middle-west.
Heacock, Nebraska, and Welnstock,
Washington were his second round
and semi-final round victims respect
ively. Neither of these men were able
to extend ooggesball, who won in
straight sets.

Wills Sneetdfors' Applause

In the final'match the Aggie play-
er time after time attempted to take
the net, but the Pioneer star passed"
him easily with Sideline shots that
brought the spectators to their feet
with bursts of applause. The set
which fell to Barnes came through it
slight letdown on Coggeshall’s part,
and some fine driving by Barnes.

The doubles event seemed to lie on
its Way to Grinnell until late in the
last part of the fourth set, when Grin-
Dell had two sets, and match point at
52 on Royer and Mason of Oklahoma,
but the Sooners pulled that set and
the following one out ot the fire and
took the doubles trophy back to Nor—
man for the third consecutive time.

Wenkens In Doubles

Coggeshall weakened noticuhly
the lftst two sets 01} this event, having
played eleven sets of championship
tennis during the morning and after-
noon. As it was, the Grinnell pair
demonstrated a superiority in almost
every line of play that indicated 2L
Grinneli victory. Stotts played fine
tennis throughout the match. as did
Coggeshall, but the Sooner team out—
steadied the Grinnell players in the
closing sets to Win. The lnen were on
the courts for three itntl El hall hours
in this match. The set standings
were: 6-3, 4-6, 5-7. 1179, 54.

\Vest Stotts is the only Grinnell
man graduating from the squad this
year, and with several players of
aboye average ability coming on, Grin.
iicll should enjoy another season of
tennis leadei hip next spring.

Weight Star Leads
Valley Tracksters

Ritlefort High Scorer Saturday;
McKee Second In Quarter;
Laird Fouls,

By a win in the shot and a second
ill the discus, Captain Rillclort led
the Pioneer scorers in the Missouri
Valley meet which was held at Linr
coin Sfltul'dzl_. Hls toss of 45 feet
11 inches in the brass bull event was
easily the best throw of the meet.
while his 13-1 foot discus heave out-
distauced his competitor-s until the
final throw whcn Pospislc of Nebras-
ka threw the platter more than 137
feet. The high Wind accounted for
the lack of good marks in the discus
event.

McKee surprised the valley
stel‘s when he took second in the
quarter. He earned his place by a
sprint at the finish which call-led him
from sixth place to just short of first,
Best of Oklahoma Aggie: Winning.
Best's time was 49.5 and McKee was
unofficially timed at 49.7 seconds.

Foul Disappointment

The big disappointment of the meet
same when Laird, who was doped to
take the iavelin by a safe margin, fell
back to fourth place in his event. ni-
though he clearly indicated his ability
by tossing the spearualmost 187 feet
on two of this throws, he fouled on
both occasions and was forced to be
content with a 170 foot throw which
barely placed. The event went at 179
feet. Laird is expected to overcome
his fouling jinx and may place high
in the national intercollegiate meet
which will be held early in June.

Long showed up well in the' low
hurdles when he took a close third in
one or the fastest preliminary hearts.

Some exceptional marks were hung
up in the valley meet this year. Cfull—
umn'of dines stopped the half in
1:56,1 which is within a tenth of a
second of the valley record. Conger.
also of Ames took a thrilling mile
from Johnson of Nebraska in 3.
Wirsig a Corlihuskcr, set a new ree-
ord in the pole vault by clearing 13
feet 4 inches. Grady of Kansas cov—
ered the century in 9.6 seconds equal-
ling Locke’s mark of last ycar.

Reporter Finds Nebraska Prison
Does Not Resemble Old Dungeons

By Joe McKee.

(Editor’s note: Saturday morning
while at the' Missouri Valley meet in
Lincoln, Nebraska, ‘a group of Grins
nell and Drake track men visited the
Nebraska. state penitentiary.)

Fifteen minutes ride tram the hem-L
of Lincon, Nebraska, one finds a set
ting ‘l‘or the “Prisoner’s" song of last
season's fame. The stolid gray or the
cement blocks of the Nebraska state
penitentiary is broken by the Colo-
nllll Architecture of the wm‘den’s
home With its green lawn and flower
beds, The bars are scarcely percep-
tible for any distance from the build-
ings.

No Prison Stripes
As the bus turned up a crushed rock

dr e the guard towers on the walls,
the barred windows and gates began
to gather one into the atmosphere of
a prison. Alter the warden had
granted us the chaplain for a guide,
the party filed out through a barred
gate into the inner court where sc-
veral men were working around flow-
cr bcds. One looks in vain for the
fabled prison stripes; here the men
wear blue denim pants, and, because
the weather is hot, sleeveless cotton
shirts. Within the walls of the court
the visitor feels the piercing glance of
the guards and of the gunmen who
are stationed in vantage points
throughout the whole grounds and of

Cinder Men Will .
Meet Drake Here

Dual To Be Run Off 0): Ward
Field In Place of Drake
Stadium Next Saturday.

Coach Lester Duke and his« Mill
tesc bearers will meet the Drake Bull-
dogs in a dual track meet on Ward
field Saturday afternoon, The meat
was transferred from Des Moines, the
original site for the event, because the
Drake field is being torn up ni‘lor to
making extensive repairs on the fool-
ball field.

Drake and Grinnell were both de~
feated by Ames in dual meets this sea-
son. and by nearly equal ratios. This
indicates that the meet here on Satur-
day aftcrnoon should be a close affair
unless something unforeseen occurs.
Coach Ebert has assembled a neat ar-
ray of cinder artists at Drake, includ-
ing several who are the class of the
Valley in their events. In this line he
will not be surpassing the Grinnell
mentor, for Grinnell likewise can
boast several potential Valley chains
oions.

Rineiort Sure Winner.

Captain Riucfort, who won the shot
event, and secured second in the dis»
cus at the conference meet, is doped
as a sure winner in both of these
specialties, and in addition, Meeter
should place second to him in the dis—
Cus, and at least third in the shot.
Bnettger has been distancing llccter
in the brass ball throw, and will prob—
ably pull up second in this contest.

Drakc has almost everything in the
high jump with Biunk. Valley cllamr
pion, and citric a consistent pnintwin-
nci- around six feet. McCully is the
only Pioneer jumpcr of merit, and
third is about the best that can bc
bredicted for him in this meet.

Drake likewise has the pole vault
well in hand \ th Captain Dfllbey cn-
tcrcd Dailiey lias scaled twelve fcct
si. inches, and will easily clear the
four yztril distance on Saturday, Mar
Carty is Grillncll's only hope in the
event.

Hurdles Should Re 1" st

In the hurdles there should be two
classy races betwccn l’cnquite, Drake,
who placed in both events in the com
iercucc affair, and Davis and Loug,
Gl'iuucll timber experts. These two
may beat the Bulldog star, for each
has negotiated the short and long
[lists in good time.

McKee, who placed second in the
«no at Lincoln last week, is not in
the best of shape, having slightly pull»
ed a tendon in his leg several weeks
ago, and which injury he agravated in
his run against the pick of the con-
fcrence. Mckeo stepped his quarter
in . 9 7, the fastest time for a Grinnell
man in several years, and can he look-
erl upon to stay well up in the pack
this week. .

The dash cvents look like tossups
between Richards, Drake, and Beck.
Gl'illnell. These boys are both small
