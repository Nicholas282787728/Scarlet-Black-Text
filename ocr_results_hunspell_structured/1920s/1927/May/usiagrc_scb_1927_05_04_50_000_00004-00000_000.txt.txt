GRIESINGER TALKS
T0 BUSINESS MEN

“There is a great need in American
industry today for college-trained
business men. Men who have studied
business practice and ethics are ex-
ceedingly scarce in large industrial
concerns.” said F. s. Grlesinger.
branch manager of the Good year Tire
and Rubber company at a talk to the
Business club Sunday atternoon in the
clubroom or Building Four.

Mr. Gricsingor presented a briei his-
torical rcsnme oi the development or
the rubber industry from will) to the
present time. “The tremendous ex-
pansion oi the industry might be
measured by the fact that'whereas
only 27,000 tons or rubber were used
industrially in 1900, over 510,000 tons
were processed in 1925," he said.

Mr, Griesinger traced the evolution
of rubber from the gum as it comes
from the tree to the commercial rub-
ber used today. He described the in-
dustrial processes by which rubber is
made ready [or nlztrliet.
