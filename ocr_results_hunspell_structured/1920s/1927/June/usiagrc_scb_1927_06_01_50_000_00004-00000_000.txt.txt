Closing Year Marks Beginning Of
New Era In History Of Grinnell

The year just closing. according to
college olticials. is marked by a num-
ber ot advances of such important
character as to indicate the beginning
or a new era in the development or
crinnell.

Foremost among these is the es-
tablishment of an extensive scliola
ship loan plan tor men. Based on an in-
itial gift from the J. c. Penny touuda-
tion for administrative purposes. large
bequests iroiii friends or the college
have made possible the immediate es—
tablishment ot six - rull scholarships
loans for men. This number will in
all probability be increased in the near
future. 1t is President Mains belief
that tiie scholarshiprioan method is so
rational a plan ot college financing
for men students that large sums for
this pin-pose will be available before
long. coming troui donors who are
seeking the best possible way of mains
mining educational ideals.

Together with the scholarship-loan
plan the inauguration ol the depart-
ment of vocational guidance has talt»
en place. and although the first year
of this department has been largely
experimental. its need and possibilities
have made themselves evident.

Establishment oi the department or
phi ical education for men on an ad-
ranccd educational basis is regarded
as one at the big achievements or the
year. The tour 'etlr credit course in
physical education and coaching. lead-
ing to a minor. in connection with
with the regular bachelor of arts cur-
riculum, was outlined by Director
Hayes and the members of the depart-
ment. The course has been approved
by Directoiuelcct Troesdale. and will

 

be carried out substantially s plan»
ued. with such modilications as may
appear desirable as the course gets
under way. ’

Expansion oi the courses in busi-
ncss administration and economics
through enlarging the staff ol those
departments meets an urgent demand.
llore Griunell graduates enter llllsir
lless Lllilll any other field. It has llccll
(liificlllt, with the rapidly increasing
demand for these courses. to keep up
with the demand. but Grinnell will be
in better shape from now on. in this
respect. than it has ever been.

Dre-technical courses are to be more
thoroughly systeuiatized next year by
the addition of all Elementlt ' course
in mechanical drawing. The qllalit'
of the men who enter graduate schools
of engineering and science from Grin-
nell is signitlcant. and is considered
ample reason for giving greater eni-
pbasis to this department of college
work, Gi-innell makes no attempt to
give short courses in mechanical or
other fields or engineering. but the
success of Griiinell graduates in the
past proves that the pretecliiiical and
ore-scientific work taken here is of
the highest value.

important additions to the courses are
fel'ctl. notably a now coursc in the
psychology of adolescence. a course
in educational psychologr. a course in
the liisto of American education and
a course in the administration of sec-
Dﬂdﬂl‘y education. Through these
courses the college established its
work in education on a still more ad-
vanced basis. considerably beyond the

technical requirements ol the state
board and other similar bodies.

One of the most siglillicont steps
the college has taken ill litany years is
the addition of it new science. geolog
and the appointment or Dr. Frank A
Wilder as prolcssor of geology. As
this s ice will be on the same basis
as those already given, it offers a new
option to li-eshinen and sophomores
for their required science. and it also
opens up a field of instruction of tune
dalncntal importance in a great many
professions.

The curriculum is being enlarged in
other courses also. notably in the an
lll'Et. itioii of art and architecture. in
history and archaeology. in speech.
and in the department of Applied
Christianity.

All or these developments are in
line with the policy or President Main
and the faculty and trustees of Initli‘

ive and more distinctive. in keeping
with its distinct place of leadership
among American liberal arts college.
and they are but the beginning. ac—
cording to President Main. of a for
reaching and much wider dcvelopnicn
which is to be anticipated.

Nothing which ‘has taken place dur-
ing the past college -car has been
more gratifying. it is stated. than the
manner iii which the college has been
able to meet and to surmount with

none situation which has prevailed
throughout this part of the country
[or the past tew years, As was pres
dictca by an autho ity on college l’ll'r
ance more than ten years ago. the
post-war conditions have caused many
at the colleges of the cniint to be
“bled white." and have so e.1lallsled
the resources of a number at l'ilstir
tutions as to bring about their demise.
Although Grinnclrs position. illldnr
cialli w a never so ilcspei ate as that
of many institutions. yet it was dcs-
perate enough eighteen months ago to
cause very serious apprehension on
the part or the president. trustees.
lacul . alumni. and students and
wild rumors as to the impending tlls~
aster were scattered broadcast.

How completely this cr.is was or-
ercome has been shown in the terms
on which the new bonds or the Griir
iiell college toundation. which is the
corporation operating the dormitories
and other college property. were fin-
anced. The o nal issue called (or
. per cent interest; the new new is»
sue bears only live per cent. Various
financial concerns competed for the
bonds. and iii the surrey of college as
sets which was made on account or
the purchasers of the bonds it was
brought out that Griiiuell college is
entitled to as high a rating as any
corporation in the state of Iowa. and
its bonds were purchased for invest
ment by one of the leading lite insur-
ance companies. Grinnelrs assets are
now estimated at very nearly 55.0007
000.00. With the continued exercise
of strict economy the college is on a
sounder basis financially than it has
been at any time in its history.

The increase of the tuition from
$200 to $250 a year. which went into
ettect last September. had no percept-
ible etfect on the attendance. and i .
creased sums available for scholar-
ships and student aid have enabled
without interruption. Grinnelrs cor-
is shown by the number of colleges
who have followed this leadalthough
the tuition rate in the west is still
much below that charged by eastern
colleges.

Since last commencement the new
swimming pool has been built. and its
contance use since its opening early
in the tall has shown what a place it
fills. The cost of approximately $25,-
000 was provided by contributions
irom alumni. friends of the college
and the class or 1926.

N0 year since the college began its
work has witnessed to many import
ant developments. The educational
