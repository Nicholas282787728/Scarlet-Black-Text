Szigeti To Be Accomptuliell ill Ilccilill
At Herrick Chapel Frillily by
Kurt Rulu—seil’z.

Joseph Szigeti, the Hungarian Vice
linisl. who will be heard here Friday
is perhaps the most famous contend»
porary violinist who has even visited
this country. In Europe he is ranked
with Iii-aislel' and other world celer
brities of the violin. and his coming
again to America is one of the mus-
ical events of the season.

A native of Budapest, he made his
public debut at the age of thirteen in
\three musical center . Budapest.
Dresden, london Since then he has
become a master of his instrum_cut.

Broad Musician

The new violinist is an exceptional
ly broad musician. He plays not on-
ly the familiar classics, but also many
works by old masters which are little
known to most musicians. he is said to
have few equals, and nrany of the pope
ular modern works for violin have
had their first performances at his
hands,

Szigetiis a youngman, barely thir v,
with an attractive stage personality.
He is an accomplished linguist, and
writes and speaks English fluently He
has_made a study of American music
and has played several American
works which have never before been
played in this country, His concert
here promises to he one of the most
engrossing recitals ol' the course.

He has played in every country of
the world except South America and
in the Orient. London acclaimed him
as “one of nature's violinists," Chris—
tiania announced that his playing had
"the sacred Tire," holgona declared
that such playing had been unknown
to us since the interpretations of
Kreisler." Madrid hailed him as “a.
magician." Rome summarizes the mat-
ter by calling him "a master of the
violin."

Program Varied

In comparison further to other art-
ists, the St. Louis Globe Democrat
had this to say of him, "He has near-
ly all that Heifetz has in the way of
technique and a good deal more‘ than
that wizard in the way of heart,”

Szigeti will play the following pro-
gram. accompanied ‘by Kurt Kuhn

FINDING SKULLS Olj‘ FIRST TRUE
MAMMALS IMPORTANTiANDREWS

liy l tlrcrluc siruons

"The most important single dis
covery of our expedition." said Dr- R0
Chapman Andrews in an interview
Tuesday night, "was that of the skulls
oi the ﬁrst true mammals. We found
six of them, no one over an inch and a
half long. and yet the discovery is of
the utmost importance to science.
These skulls mark the very beginnings
of the mammals, the very ﬁrst warm
blooded creatures. They existed be
fore the‘Tel-tiary, some ten millions of
years ago, and were the next step from
reptilian life.

"It is difficult to get the importance
of this discovery across to the public,”
continued Dr. Andrews, "(or science it-
self can scarcely grasp its full import,
The fact that the actual discovery oi
the ﬁrst mammal has been made is of
tremendous importance to the determi-
nation of following forms. A similar
discovery was made in South Africa,
but the specimens were not those of a
true mammal.“

Dr. Andrews, when questioned as to
the importance of parts of the world
other than central Asia as ﬁelds of re-
search replied. “Central Asia appears
to be the center from which all
paleontological discovery radiates. It is
true that some parts of the world have
disclosed certain particular forms. but
central Asia with its dry climate is
the richest ﬁeld available. Eight of
the thirteen great forms known to,
pale-ontology were discovered there in
Asia, and even now we have barely
scratched the surface.”

The work of Dr, Andrews’r expedir
tion, and of all such expeditions into
Mongolia is dangerous, and Dr. An-

interest in the Missouri Valley
championship race, which for the last
five years has resolved itself into n
guessing contest as to which team
would come the nearest to defeating
Kansas, took on a new aspect with the
close of the second week of play, be-
cause for the first time in more than
five years, the Jayhawks face the
possibility of turning over their bas-
ketball crown to a new king.

Iowa state college, commonly
known as Ames although their pulls
lrcity department won't admit it. ilnd
for long a second division team as far
as basketball was conccrned, is the
cause of the new turn in championship
prospects, for they pulled the unex-
pected last Saturday, and humped off
Phog Allen's Kznssns, who have won
so consistently that they have forgot-
ten what defeat is, to the tune of 13
to 12. Of course Kansas has been de-
feated before and still come off with
the hunting, but that was in the days
when all the games counted, and every
team was met in the well known dire
cular robin fashion.

Samuel-s Ila c Chance

At present Oklahoma and the Kan-
sas Angles lead the league, and of the
two, the former has the best chance
at the title since under the now
twelvergame plan, they were not re-
quired to meet the Jayhawks, and 11‘
they had scheduled them, it woud have
been like the Grinnell-Amcs game last
Monday, a good one to !orget since the

as the pennant was concerned. Halve
ever, the Sooners have anything but

both the Kansas Aggles and Nebraska

brigands in the region.

"You want me to relate my harrow-
ing experiences?" smiled Dr. Andrews.
"Well, they are very commonplace, ale
tcr all. I used to write in my articles
of our encounters with these brigands,
but I received many protests against
this bloodshed. , It didn't seem to
make any diffcleuce to the protesters
that the bandits were rafter our lives.
After all, it’s all in a day’s work, and
it is no more dangerous than walking
'tlle streets of New York.”

I asked Dr. Andrews to tell me what
discovery of his had given him the
greatest thrill. He ignored the “dis-
covery" part and replicr, “my biggest

"How does American civilization feel

was my last question. ”America feels
all right,“ responded Dr, Andrews, "for
I am one of those persons who can ﬁnd

Underthe guiding eye of Coach
Theodore Turner, the Pioneer swim-
mers have been developing rapidly, al—
though having been in the new pool
but a short time. With the first meet,
a dual with Drake at Des Moines on
February 2, but a few weeks away, the
so~cnlled “mermeu” of the college are
undergoing a great deal in the Line of
stiff workouts and drill. A squad of
about fifteen men are reporting to
Coach Turner, among whom are sev»
ersl men of considerable promise,
Stalls Fancy Diver

Perhaps foremost on the squad
comes Wcst stotts, fancy diver, whose
work on the diving board has been the
sensation of the swimming practices
to date. Almost anything in the cone
quest line can be expected of Stotts
this year. Although he has never come
rated in intercollegiate swimming ell»
clethls knowledge and ability in the
art of diving are sufficient to carry
him through most meets in a premier
position.

John Martin, Des Moiues, former
high school champion in the lull-yard
free-style event, is stepping the short
dash in fast time, clipping the dies
tancc in 1:07 several days ago. This
timc is very fast considering the size
of the pool and Martin's condition. A
mark of 1:03 in a pool the size of the
new natatorium is fast enough to win
most meets in intercollegiate compe.
tition.

Cohen Not in Trim

Milton Cohen, the third of the Des
Mollies trio on the team, specializes
in the breast stroke, and like Martin,
held the state record in this event
while attending West Des Maine: high
school. Cohen is not in the best of
physical condition as yet, but can be
Counted upon to score points for the
Pioneer team in practically all the
meets of the season.

Other men who are reporting, who

"I have been asked many times how

whether we really know their location

indication that a fossil is there or we
do not dig. Two forces in nature
have greatly aided fossilization; de-
position and erosion. in late years,
erosion in Asia has been so much
more rapid than deposition that fossils
are coming more and more to the sur~
face."

Mr. Andrews di ded his lecture into
four di isions; past animal life in
Mongolia. present animal life there.
past human life there, and present hu-
man life. He told of discovering the
first dinosaur eggs in 1923, at the foot
of the naming cliffs, and of the ex»
citement that prevailed when the find
was made. A huge block which was
thought to contain more of the eggs
was sent to the museum in New York.

The play, "Charley’s Aunt,” to he
presented February 15 at tbe Colonial
theatre with faculty actors i con-
ccrned chiefly with the love affairs of
three Oxford students.

When the curtain rises, Jack Ches—
ney is trying to write to his sweet-
heart, Kitty Verdun.
ed by Charley Wykham who comes in
for help on a similar task. The latter-
is unable to make a date with Amy
Spettingue because of thc fact that his
aunt, Donna Lucia D’Alvndul‘ez, is
coming to visit him. Donna Lucia
D’Alvadorez is the widow of a Brazilv
ian millionaire and has never seen
her nephew.

Father line writ-ll

The two boys conce' e the brilliant
idea of invrting the two girls to lunch
to meet the aunt who will be char
heron, and decide that Lord Farcourt
Eahberley will act as companion to
the aunt to keep her amused,

Babberly, who is to take the part
of an old lady in some amateur theate
rrcals is induced by the boys to try
on his costume before lunch. In the
meantime Jack’s father arrives unexe
pectedly from india and a telegram
comes from the aunt saying that she
will not arrive for a few da-s.

The girls also appear, aodsinco they
will not stay without proper cliapere
nudge, Bahbs (Dabber-lay) rn his the-
atrical costume is drafted into service.

Fears Marriage

The party is interrupted by Stephen
Spettigue, die girls’ guardian, who is
positively averse to their interest in
any elesihle young men, because when
the girls marry he will stiffer finan-
cial cmbarrassment. ,

When Bahhs is introduced to him as
the wealthy widow. Spettigue becomes
quite affable, to the extent of pursuing
Eahbs; ohiect, matrimony. He has a
rival, however, in Jack's father, who
seeks to free himself from financial
difficulty by a wealthy marriage. He
proposes to nahhs in the garden.
Spettigue and the“ boys chase Eahbs
all over the garden; Spettigue's pur-
pose being to propose also. The boys
purpose, however, is to reprimand and
subdue Babbs. whose affectionate at-
tentions to their girls have caused
them some discomtort.

Aunt Appears

Charley zlnd Jack manage to make
their proposals successful, but nothing
is binding until they receive the guar»
dian’s consent in writingmand what
better person to get that than Donna
Lucia D’Alvddorez.

Into the garden unexpectedly comes
the real Donna Lucia D’Alvadorez
with Babherley's “own little girl," El-
ln Delaney. She learns from Jack‘s
father that Charley’s aunt is already
upon the scene and so gives a fictir
tious name in order to watch and en-
joy proceedings

And the further complications are
not adjusted until Mr. Spettigue gives
his dinner party in the last act.
