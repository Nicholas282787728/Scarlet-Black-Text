GRINNELL ALUMNUS IS NATIONAL

AUTHORITY IN

TELEPHONY FIELD

 

By Laurence Lundcn

The development of pcrmailoy and
its application in the continuous load-
ing of transoceanic cables and the de—
velopment of the New York-Azores
with the terminal apparatus tor senor
ing and receiving with a speed more
than four times as great as that of
any previous cable or equal length has
taken place in the research depart—
ment of the Bell Telephone labora-
tories under the direction or Dr. one
ver E. Ellckcly, who graduated from
Grinnell in 1503 and acted as physics
instructor 1909-1910.

Dr, Buckcly had his introduction to
the field of telephony during his high
school years when he had charge of a
small automatic system in use at
Sloan, lowa. He served as uhdel‘v
graduate assistant in physics during

his Junior and senior 'eill's in college
and served as an instructor in the

laboratory for one year iollowing his‘

graduation irom Grinnell.
ltlrlltlt‘tl Cornell U.

The next step in the remarkable

career on Dr. Buckcly come in the
following year when he was appoln
ed assistant in the physics dcpai
ment in Cornell university. in 1014
he received his degree oi Doctor ol
Philosophy. From that time until he
entered the war as a major in the
Slgunl Corps, Dr. Buckely worked on
thc production and measurement of
high vacun; the ionization manomen-
ter was one of his contributions to the
latter art.

Dr, Buckely , connection with the
Bell telephone system means more
when the importance or this corpor-
ation is realized. The Bell Telephone
Laboratories, incorporated, comprises
the consolidated laboratories ol the
American Telephone and Telegraph
company and the Western Electric
company. The xpense or maintain
ing this organization is divided be—
tween the two corporations according
to the nature of the work done. The
research department staff comprises
some four hundred workers, working
in nine main divisions, in the sectors oi
the frontier of knowledge in which
these corporations are most interest-
ed. Dr. Buckely is the chief of the die
vision working in magnetism and its
application. The Bell Laboratories
Record has the following article coh~
coming Dr. Buckely:

JIllglletisln Fllnilitlnolllnl

“Magnetism is a subject fundaluehr
tal to electrical communication; it eh-
tcrs into nearly every device which
converts electrical energy into me—
chanical. Development of new mag-
netic materials and their special ap-
plications are among the research
problems of Oliver,E. Buckely.

“Six group heads report to Mr.
Buckely, Gusto: w. Elman,- inventor
of pcrmalloy, continucs to develop
new magnetic materials and to find
new fields for their application. Louis
w. hicxeehan conducts researches
in ferromagnetism and Xel‘zty crystal
analysis through which he has worked
out an explanation of the properties
or pcrmalloy. John G. Gilbert has
charge of loaded submarine cahlc de-
velopment; Allison A. clokey has ﬂee
veloped terminal apparatus and subs
marine cables; in his group has been
done all the engineering of the new
multiplex system now being installed
on the Azores cable. John E. Johnson.
well known for his cathode-ray oscil~
lograph. is engaged in special vacuum
tube studies. F. s. Goucher, who
withdrew from the laboratories to
serve in the Br-tish army, has returned
recently and will carry on a study or
the mierophonic properties or citr-
him."

The record of Dr. Buckely is es-
pecially interesting to students of
Grinneli, for he represents the heights
to which many Grinnell alumni rise.
The success of Dr.‘Buckely is es-
pecially interesting to those on the
faculty who still remember him as at
student. Prof. F. F. Aimy, tread ot
the physics department. is a person—
al triend of Dr. Buckeiy and received
the news of the recent achievement of
his division.

Proves Too Big ll Handicap For

Battling against a heavy handicap in
the wily of height and experience, the
Gn'nnell cagemen succumbed to a 29-
23 defeat at the hands of the Oklahoma
Sooners, in a Valley game at the
Men's gymnasium Saturday evening.
The game was a herd battle all the
way. and it was only in the last low
minutes of the game that the southern
men clinched the game.
Sooners Score First

The scoring started with the Sotm-
ers sweeping into the lead by

free tosses, but this lead was over

against them, the Grinnell team fought
to overcome this lead. A brace or

tosses brought the score to 23 91, but
at this point the visitors, with only
several minutes to play, swelled their-
total to 29 on three baskets. A lone
basket, by Coggeshall, completed the
Grilmell scoring.

Coggcshali again played a remark-
able game in both offense and rler
Itense. being ahiy assisted by Davis
and Fail. Coggeshall accounted for
five baskets and three free tosses dul'r
ing the game, but showed a marked
weakness in the free throwing depart-
ment of the giune, missing seven char-
ity shots. Fail played a line defensive
game, and in addition, proved that he

margin necessary.
