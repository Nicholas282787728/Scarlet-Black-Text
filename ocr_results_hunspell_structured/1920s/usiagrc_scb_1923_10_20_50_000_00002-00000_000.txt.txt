THE CYCLONE

As Cyclone time once more dl'lws

near, our attention is brooght_to the
startling fact that the 1934 Cyclone

Board went in debt several hundred,

dollars. This tact has an appealing
significance to everyone ct this time.

tisements a. College can have, and nut
only the class that publishes the book,
:but also the whole school is proud hi
an animal which is a credit to the in-

'lllat reason we don't want the 1925
Cyclone to he lilIcl'iol' in any way to
the annual or last yccu

As the book is planned now, it will
