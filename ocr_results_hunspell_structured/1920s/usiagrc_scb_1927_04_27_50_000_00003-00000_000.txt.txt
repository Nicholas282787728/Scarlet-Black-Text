that our Grinnell community is not
satisiactorily in possession at all the
iacts which underlay Griunell's with-
drawal ircm the national olleract play
contest at Northwestern University.
it is know that we prepared a play
{or competition and subsequently
withdrew, out the erroneous notion
exists to an unfortunate extent that
the tault is ours—I should say. mine.
because the responsibility would be
mine _

B e‘lly. the iacts are these. North
western presented two speciﬁc regula-
tions which, subsequently violated by
her, were the cause at the situation.
it was speciﬁed that registrations
opened . arch is and closed April 1
and that entries would he accepted in
order or receipt until nine competi-
tors werc entered. It was further
stated that no two schools could pre»
sent the same play, priority being
given to the school submitting any
particular choice ﬁrst. March 3 I
wrote asking it the regulation regard
ing entry meant that registrations
would not he accemed until March 15.
1 received no reply and assumed that
I was supposed to wait till that date.
My entry was dated March 12 and
accepted with the choice ot play
approved. April 5 I received a wire
from Northwestern asking it we could
Po sihly choose another play; by an
oversight on their part, priority had
hecn granted to us instead of to an»
other school whose registration was
dated March :1. I replied that it was
then too late to choose another play
that it I had received an answer to my
letter or March 3. Grinncll could llttve
proceeded with enough etticiency to
do the right thing, and that we were
willing to compete with any school
with the same play. Their answer
was that iurthcr error on their part
had entered four of their nine dome
petitors with the same play. And,
ﬁnally. though they had waived the
rule about the date or entry and had
ignored my inquiry in regard to that,
they were adamant in their decision

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Speaking of fine tobaccos
—Have a Camel!”

MODERN smokers ﬁnd in Camels
a nicety of blending, a friendly
cordiality of ﬂavor, an inherent
goodness that thrills from the ﬁrst
puﬂ to the last. That is why
Camels are the favorite of the
present age. The warmth of golden
sunlight or autumn ﬁelds gleams
in their smoke. Camels are the
modern expression of all that is the
ﬁnest.

Camel quality and Camel excel-
lence are recognized wherever

modem smokers gather. Particu-
lar smokers in this hard-to-plezse
age ﬁnd the best of Turkish and
Domestic tobaccos blended in this
famous cigarette. They find a con-
sistent goodness that never fails,
no matter how liberal the smoking.

Arid wherever modem smokers
gather, wherever the conversation
turns to tobacco, to the world’s
best, someone is sure to say:
“Speaking of ﬁne tobaccos . . .
—Have a Camel!”
