(‘OJL‘IERCULI

An administration building‘was completed at a small
mid-western college a short time ago. it was a sub-
stantially hiiilt structure and its beauty was greatly en—
hanced by a lacade which was not only a teat‘iirc ot the
building but n decided asset to the entire cainpi , How. .
ever, a cry of protest was raised at such extl's 'zigfi‘nce.
sonic statistician discovered that another lloor could have
been added to the structure if it were constructed of
cheaper material and plaincr design. The beauty of the
facade was lost, its value to the general environment was
ignored because of a perverted idea of economy, of camp
nicrcialisin, if you please. ‘-,

The taunt often flung at us Americans by foreigners
is that commercialism has been so imbibed into us, that
it penetrates into our every activity, whether it be
architecture, advertising, drama, composing, painting or
even religion. Business men sacrifice the beauty or their
buildings in construction it the monetary cost is lesson-
ed ; wclhltnown advertisers hiiy up the signatures of “four
ous people"; artists of drama, music, pointing inust
sacrifice care and qualili‘ tor quantity production that
they may earn their daily salt; small universities squirm
when good professors demand more money; and lastly,
modern church edifices have a tendency to lean away
from the good chapel and cathedral types,

structures. A plotilude is that we are very unsusceptlhic
to new theories and newly established facts. Yet we
have accepted commercialism without one douht, distrust,
hesitancy, scruple or perplexlty. Since we acccpt it, it

NEED FOR IiEI’OIUI

The Amer an Associations of Deans and Ad ‘ ers oi
Men met last week for their annual central and western
convention in Boulder, Colorado, It is unfortunatc that
Grinliell college was not represented at this meeting ior
a great deal in the way of solving dormitory and student
problems could have been learned. We feel that Gl'in»
neli must look outward rather than inward to insuie
'tlie best for itself.

In an interview with President Acheson of lilacales
tcr college, he said that one of the greatest reforms
needed among liberal arts colleges was a rc', 'siou ot
ythe formal, mechanical means of securing a diploma.
However, he declared that no college would be able to
make this revision because at the domination oi the his
universities through their rating and evaluating credits
from colleges.

Now comes word troni theconvcntion held at Boulder.
“Academic distinction as it guarantee of has
proven a failure in the United States because, under our
mechanical system of petty shoit-tei-m credits, persons
almost wholly lacking in intellectual ability may be
ranked with the best in the college world," stated Deon
Lindsey Blayney of Carleton.

success

“Not until two revolutionary adjustments are made
can American higher education win the respect of the
world,” dcclarcd Dean Blayney. “First, our present
mechanical means of securing a diploma by accumulating
a certain amount of but casually related scholastic chips
to he cashed by the registrar at short inter-cola before
the information they represent evaporates, must he re-
pldced by setting before the students a definite intellect
ual goal to be attained only by logical thinking, and sits-
mined constructive effort. thus challenging the highest
ability of the most intelligent youth of America.

“Secondly, the careful evaluating of such ability by a
comprehensive final e. amination, not by terms of semesr
ters. but at l/he conclusion of the college course, and not
to test the student’s fund of scattered inloi-mation, but
to give him the opportunity of proving that he can think
and reason logicall "

We feel that until some such step as Dean Elayney
suggests American institutions of learning will not only
he deluding themselves, but in the midst of almost
criminally wasteful expenditure of yast sums will cone
tinue to deprive our intellectually strongest youth of
the opportunities and advantages of that significantly inc
tellectual training which is their birthright and should be
their highest possession.
