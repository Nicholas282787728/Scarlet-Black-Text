There are many cases in the world's
has

history, when a great danger

menaced a people, and has threatened

homes, and nations with destruction.
Such crises

tions, that have brought people to-
gether on a. common ground, wrtlr a
common purpose, and a common need
for the last ounce of united ertort of

each individual, to preserve the lite ot

their possessions. it is under these
circumstances that small armies have
been known to overwhelm the armies
of great powers, and has made heroes
ct ever-y soldier rn the ranks.

What has carried them through the
struggle? Why are such teats possi—
ble? it is because they are fighting
for a worthy ideal or purpose, and
are backed by the fiery conviction
that they have something great to ac-
complrsh.

it was such a crisis that the lows
Band, and those that rollawed, met
and triumphed over, during the strug-
gles against tires and to
round a college in which they could
incorporate the ideals and standards
which they had set down as their goal.
Their will to succeed in what they
thought was right would not permit
them to stop, where many others
would have stopped, and this same
spirt that has lett the
campus, carried them through to suc
cess.

rroday a crises races the college.
This time there are several thousand
alumni and students able to right to
carry their alma mater past danger,
and to tound again the spirit or the
Iowa Band. Is not the present gener»
ation as able as our forefathers? Are
not those who have reaped the ma—
terial success of the efforts or that
heroic hand able to do as much to

Indifference is E thing that
never been known of Grinnell stud-
enls.’ This crisis will bring the stud-

has

ant body into a common spirit, more
intense than even the most enthusias-
Lic have hoped for. A great cause has
been set before us, and we know that
it is one that is both worthy and vital.
Already dozens of. students have vol-
unteered their time and el‘lorts in has
half of the endowment campaign.
Many requests for information and
instruction: as to what can be clone

have come to the student campaign‘

committee, and already conLI‘lbutions
from die savings of pennies have been
brought in. This is the beginning of
an event which will go down in the
history of the college as another step
in the long list or great achievements
already there.

CLA S ELECTIONS
It is interesting to note the widely
different activities on various college
campuses that receive special empha-
sis from each institution, on some
campuses the athletic season takes

the gr atcst portion or the attention|

of the student body, to the cxclusic
of nearly everything else, While at
other universities the social functions

er has been too little recognized llel’c.
Elections seldom arouse enough in—
tercst to bring out more than one;
iourth of the class meeting. one
.person is usually nominated lor- each‘
ofﬁce. someone then moves that the
nominations cease, and everyone snpr
ports the motion with n. sigh of relief,

played on the newly elected officer-J,

As a result of this ploceedllre, the
dignity 01 the class presidency, and of |
most of the other campus adminis—
trative offices, has fallen to an al-
most ridiculous level. Instead of the
presidency or a class being a muchi
sought for office, it is of little or no
importance. It has been mode 50. In-

with which some member can he hon-
ored or inilictcd. The possibilities of
the ofﬁce have never been recognized,
and the term or ottico is too short tor
one person to get star-ted, it he wishes
to accomplish anything while in the
administrative chair. The method of
holding the election is also not con-
ducive to the use of good judgment in
voting.

0: the above reasons, the one con-
cerning the length of term or oiirce
is probably the most important. if
a class president, and his aids, was to
hold oltice tor a complete semester,
or a whole year, his selection would
of necessity be a matter of some cons
sequence. Given a year in which to
carry out his plans for leading the
class organization, he would he exe
pectcd to work with an organized pro-
gram tor class iunctions and activities
for the whole year. Under the pres-
ent regime the ortrcers know that they
hardly have time to get started, and
do not attempt to put much individual
error-t into the work, more than to
carry out lhc traditional class t'unc-
tions. No incentive tor original init-
iative in class government is presenr
ted. ,

With a term of a whole year, the
importance of the ofﬁce would auto-
matically increase and make it more
desirable and sought after, and would
convert it from a plain tigure head
title, to a real Job, and incidentally
attach to it a real honor.

Class ollrccrs have not realized the
'posslbilltles that exist in their olllues.
Although close orgamzation ot classes
is not important in the Gl'innoll plan,
at the same time students are pretty
well identrired by the class that they

“Bum Leg Show”
By College Girls
Disrupts School

(From Marshalituwn Republican)

Milton, Wis, Dcc. 37A discussion
of the propriety of dancing, precipiz
tatcd by the ﬁrst school dance held
here in thirty-five years, threatens
drsruption of Milton College circles.

Arthur M. Mills. editor or the col—
logc paper, has resigned as a result
or criti sro tollowing the ball, and
the college iaculty, according to res
ports, is discussing legislation proa
posed to makc participation in a
dance an ottense punishable by ex-
nulsion.

A dancing exhibition given by three
girls in modified ballet costumes at a
literary society meeting was dez
l'iounced in chapel by W. o. Daland,
president or the college, who said that
he had heard only two commentsi
one that it was a "good leg show" and
the other that it was a "bum leg
show".

billion college has 110 students with
eighty more in the musical courses.
it is conducted under auspices of the
Seventh Day Baptist church, but no
sectarian tenets are taught, according
to heads or the institution.

Dancing, card playing rind use or
tobacco are rigidly prohibited.
