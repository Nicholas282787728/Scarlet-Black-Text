COOPERATION.

Gi'illuell group lllSClL ions almost inra ’ahly touch
on the question of student government. It is or it is not a
success? Is there aiiyiray that it can he made success-
ful? e believe that in its present organ
not eificient, The students stand firmly against any err
dence of faculty assistance, belligci-ently ciilsing the
thought of aid and the faculty show no desire to cooper-
ate, to assist in solving common problems.

The Grinnell faculty and the student body are the
two units of the college that should not be asked to
function separately. Whenever instances arise that call
for the vote or opinion of both tacillty and students there
is always a struggle. This is a ridiculous high school
situation and should, and could, be done away with. Co-
operation, faculty-student committees, a mutual sharing
of responsibility should take the place of this eternal
ﬂuihhling.

The argument is often given that so many of the
iaculty members are more or less transient that it would
be impossible loi- them to work with student problems
But surely they are no more transient than the students
who attempt to cope with these problems, The endless
tossing or responsibility from one group to the other
must be done away ivith.

Not until both laciiltvi and students become broad
enough to sec hnth sules oi the question, to widen their
perspectiu’, and to give attention and respect to tire othr
ers' opinions can we successiuily govern the collcge,
Neither stiidcnt nor (acuity government will succeed;

but an understanding group ironi both. working together.I

should make (or successful management.

Tl”) RUT OF THE AVERAGE.

i'rhc passion to he average is the besetting sin that
airlicts thc mcmhcrs at our college community, we have
to be like others not to be considered queer and avoided
as the plague. It is a pitilui situation and one that most
cttcctivcly stillcs all opportunity ior thought, creative
work, or expression or individuality in any manner.

The tear ol mob opinion is what drives college stu—
dents into the rat or the nvclage. We dress. talk, dancc,
[Well think. after a pattern. This inch opinion is strong.
It is evidenced :tt sessions when men and Women—Col-
lcgc StilllelllSMlliSCllss the good and bad points of others
in their group and pass judgement on them,

There are two great patterns, one or which we are
expected to iit it. The mm] or woman who we; s the
right clothes, dances the accepted why, talks of the usual
inane things, reads as little as he successfully can, and-
in nthci- w ‘5 "gets by," belongs to ouc pattern while the
one “base clothes are not collegiate, whose dancing does
not have the latest in s, and who is the antithesis oi
the other type belongs to tho coud pattern. Both groups.
are hideehollndAcdch ns mi ~uw as the other. The man
or woman whom it is impossible to place is Viewed wilhi
distrust by both groups. ‘

A socinl group is, of course, valunhlc. Lilc would
he impossible in any other \ia'y. But a social group that
[culls to completely mold its member into such idiotic
pattcius certainly needs reconstruction. Perhaps the
most pathetic college man or woman is the one who
does possess an interesting personality, has abiiity to do
something worthwhile. understands the value of books
and the utter worthlessness of speculative sessions but

, because of Eeztr or this mob opinion, because of a desire
tor popularity he thinks impossible to achieve {my other

', spends all his time stl‘ mg to make the pattern.

Although we should function as personalities within
it group, be it part of social organization. there is no
reason why we should sacrifice our individiiali , lose
Whatever claim We may have to (t distinct pelsol‘lality',
give up any desire we may have to do creative wor
that we may conform to the false standards set up 11:!

YEARS ago, P. A. showed a clean pair of heels
to the ﬁeld of smoking-tobaccos. It has main-
tained its lead ever since, putting more distance
behind it every year. There must be a reason
why P. A. is the world’s largest-selling brand.

There is! Open a tidy ted tin and get a full
breath of that class-by-itself fragrance. Then
tamp a load into the bowl of your pipe and
light up. The ﬁrst pull tells you why more men
smoke RA. than any other brand. Cool and
smooth and mellow and mild—not for one
pipe-load, but always. Try this long-burning
tobacco, Fellows. You’ll say so!
