Gates Lectures Given

alone, yet We get along and live in

seeing things its your neighbor sees

Today’s Lecture.

“Speech is not to be judged by its
direct content, but by what it reveals
of a condition of mind,” said Bishop
Francis J. McConnell Wednesday
morning in his address “Voices of the
Times," the second of the Gates lec-
tures. Speech may be symptomatic:
it may be instrumental; hut in any
case it is worth listening to in order
to discern certain distinct trends of
mind.

’ar Is Responsible
"This present period is one of great
‘pmfusioll of utterance," continued
Bishop McConnell, “The war is in a
largc part responsible for this, for it
brought with it great changes. Great
empires fell and since the war Ireland
has undergone a change. The social
and industrial systems or Russm and
Germany, respectively, have been
transformed. in India, Gliaudi has
risen; China is seething with social
upheaval. It is no wonder that pco-

“We have to l' ten among these
distracted and cm , voices and pick
out those which are worth while,” doe
clared Bishop McConnell, "Youth may
raise questions which get on the con-
scicncc of a generation group smug
and selt'rsati led. Such a voice of dis
content. pointing at particuh evils,
should not be dismissed. We must
discriminate among the voices; ask
what a man really means; and pe ‘

thing really worth while and find our-
