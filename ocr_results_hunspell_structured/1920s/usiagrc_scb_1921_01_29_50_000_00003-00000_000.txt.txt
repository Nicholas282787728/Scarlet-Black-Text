Basketball Games,

The mid-semester (lance will begin

first announced was necessary and
the dance will he held in the Rand
gymnasium. Tile men's gymnasium
had already been contracted for by
the high school basket ball team and
d misunderstanding in arrangements
caused the prior announcement that
the dance could be held in the larger
gymnasium. The committee in charge
of the dance reports that the Rand
gymnasium floor by exact measure
mentslis larger than the floor of the
Quadrangle dining room and all steps
are being taken to avoid unnrccssal-y
congestion on the floor. The dining
robin could not he used for this dance
because no vacation follows and the
slight damage which naturally befalls
the dining room furniture in being
moved will have to limit the number
of dances held each year in the dining
room.

The members or the dance commit-
tee are: Harry Flynn, Homer Aheg—
glen, Anan Hicks, Esther Vroom, El-
len Ulll and Agnes St. John. Tile in-
vited guests are President and Mrs.
J, H. '1‘. Main, Dr. and Mrs. John s,
Nulleu, Prof. and Mrs. W. H. Bridge,
Miss Luella .l. Read, Prof. and Mrs.
E. B. Scheve, Mrs. Ida Cline. Mr. and

it was pointed out, the pledge is to be
paid in iivs installment, over a period
or live years. No interest will be
charged a. student While in college,
according to Mr. McGowan. N0 in-
terest will he charged any student,
unless he gets behind in his pay-
ments, and that not While he is in
college.

The explanation that the pledges
are over a period or five years is ex-
pected to speed up pledging, and
make the amounts of the pledges
higher. it was not realized, accord-
ing to the committee, that SD many
students did not know the plan of

_ pledging.

The rreshnien pledge brought the
total subscription from voluntary
sources, that is without personal can-
vassing, up to nearly 524,000. With
nearly iive hundred students yet to be
seen, the prospects for reaching the
quota seem bright, Tho work will be
finished this week, it is hoped.
