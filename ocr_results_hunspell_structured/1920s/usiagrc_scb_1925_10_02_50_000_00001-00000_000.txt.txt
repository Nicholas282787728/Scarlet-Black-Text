01d Officers Vote to
Discontinue Meetings

CONCLUSION REACHED THAT
SOGETIES FAIL TO
SERVE PURPOSE.

The four literary societies, Insti-
tute: Ionian, Forum and Chrestmna—
thia, will probably not reorganize
this year as a. result of a. meeting of
presidents and vice-presidents held
Tuesday night, at which it was decid—
ed that there was no longer a need
for societies of the nature that has
‘existed on the campus for several
Years.

The society representatives who
reached the conclusion that societies
should be abolished \vei'e, Albeit Nic<
olet, and Elmer Chase of Chresw;
Veldo'n Mayer and Robert Burlingame,
Forum; Irwin Sampson and Harry
Lambly, Institute; Eugene Woodruff
and Russell Smith, Ionian. ‘

The officers believe that from their
very name, literary societies have two
purposes; the first literary, and the
second social. It has been evident
for some time that the former of
these functions is not adeullately dis-
charged by the literary societies. and
that this field is now satisfactorily
covered by the individualization of
special interests which resulted from
the formation of mathematics, politi—
cal science, romance language, art
and other similar clubs.

The former executives were of an
opinion that althungll much has been
said in the past concerning the social
value of Grinnell's (our societies, bnt
it has become increasingly evident
each year that Lhe building of the
dormitories, the naming of the halls
and the growth of building spirit has
supplanted them in a social way. The
intercourse of the dormitory groups
is mmental and inevitable, Where-
as Ck of the societies is forced and
artificial to a degree. The men's halls
now fill every purpose that the ﬂier
dry societies were meant to fill.

It has been suggested that a. Joint
discussion association of all Grinnell
men be formed to promote the inter-
ests of a broadening education, and,
further, that all those interested in
forensics and public speaking be seg—
regated into an organization for the
practice of platform methods. Adop-
tion of these suggestions depends up-
on whether or not it is thought a.
need for them exists.

The abolishment of literary suciet—
ies in their present form marks the
passing of a. sixty-three year old in-
stitutiou. The first one to be organ-
ized was Chrestomethia which was
(Blinded. in 1852, but a few years af-
ter Grlunell college had Come into ex-
istence. Institute‘fomid its Way to
the campus several years later and it
was not until 1506 that The third so-
ciety, Forum was organized. Ionian
was the last society to come into be-
ing although it has really existed be-
fore under an organization known as
the Quill and Gavel.

The four societies held inter—society
debates until last year when it was
voted to discontinue them on account
of lack of interest, A prize contest
known as the Merrill debate has been
held every year between two societ-
ies over some political question The
societies also competed for the Worth
trophy on a basis of poinm won by do
hating, speaking contests and pro-
grams.

Steiner Speaks I
At First “Y”

tirinilell College and Value of Y. M.
An.- Discussed by Steiner at
Meeting L T: "liurs’dm'.

Dr. Edward A, Steiner, speaking at
The opening meeting of the y, M. C.
A., Thursday evening, in the Associae
tloiis building, opened his remarks by
sketching the historical development
of Grinncll and said that
this place we would have a college
but not the Crlnnell college, which was
conceived by young men who gave
up the comforts of the east for lives
of hardship, but of service, on the

' 'es of the middle west.”

~. Steiner said that probably no
place in Iowa and perhaps none in
the Uniled States had ball so many
prayers said for it as has Grinncll,
and to this fact he attributed its con—
tinued growth and prosperity’despite
physical and moral cyclones of the
past.

The Y. I. C. A., according to the
speaker, is the dyamo of the college,
in whose poor years every other
phase of student life also suffers from
depression. Of the 24 years which
Dr. Steiner has spent in Grinnell, he
considers the last by all odds me
best, because there were a half-dozen
men who stayed behind the Y. M, C.
A. and made history by helping the
college and the Kingdom of God. He
thought that it made little difference
what the faculty believed, but that
it did make a great deal of difference
what the bunch of boys congregated
in that meeting believed.

“Religion isn't an easy thing, It
takes ‘guts' to believe in God. No
sissy has a vital belief in God and it
is easy to think that there is behind
this universe only a huge clock, beate
log out life without remorse, There
is no ‘soft' stuff as “Pull for the
Sbore’ in Christianity: 'Ortwnrd
Christian Soldiers' is the stuff!"

ier. Steiner also visualized the Y.
M.‘ c. A. as a place of love. He ques-
tioned its value if the spirit of broth-
erhood were absent, because there
is not much difference between the
savage and the pin fraternity of the
modem college men. Personally, he
did not consider his daily prayer
complete until he had spoken to ev-
eryone he met. "If the Y means any-
thing at all it means that the weak
are as the strong, with our strength
behind their weakness."

“In this place is generated a great
and terrible note: not against men
but against certain attitudes," Hatred
of snobbishncss, deception and vul-
garity was that particularly mention~
ed by the speaker.

Concluding, Professor Steiner welr
coined both old and new men to the
Y. M. C, A, not as a place in which
lo hear a had talk. for “they have
talked roll on to death,” but as a
generator 0|! power. "This dynamo
is to create in the collage, faithi

 

hope—love."

The latest reports of the Grinnell—
Cornell game has a scoreless tie at
the end of the first half, The tnd—
itional clash between the two institu-
tions .was played at Mt. Vernon. and
after the min of last night and this
mor ng the game was probably
played on a wet field that kept scor-
ing at a minimum.

The wet field probably weakened
Crinnell’s chances of defeating her
ancient rival as the Pioneer’s strong-
est oficnsive is a running, driving at—
tack led by Sweet and Moran. Unable
to resort to either end runs or passes
the Hylluid machine would have to
plug the line, which would be a slow
process against the heavy Purple for-
ward wall.

If the Cornell warriors detected the
Pioneers today it will be for the
fourth successive time as hip last
year's eleven put out by tbe Mount
Vernon school was never defeated.
IAmong lts y‘ to ' s .was a in win
ovcr the Scarlet and Black team.
However :t was the first Cuntest un—
der l-iyland‘s tutelage and as the
Grinnell squad has steadily improved
since the beginning 01 last year the
outcome was expected to be different
this fall. The Purple is under a new
coach, Barker, and today is her
first wine while the Pioneers have
had the advantage of competition al-
ready this year.

The Grinnell squad was in fair
shape for the annual battle. Captain
Sweet's ankle was not in the best of
condition following a. slight injury
last week but he was expected to
start. Scharnweber, veteran end was
left at home because of injury receiv-
ed in practice. Arden McClain, star
end of last year was back in mole-
skins this week and his scrappy some
at the wing position would consider-
ably help the Hyland team,

Although llie game today is the in—
itial game of the season for Cornell,
there is little doubt of her strength.
Last year the Purple went through
the season undefeated and most of her
stars are again on the field. Captaln
Dean is the flash of the backfield
with Dean and Hoper, both veterans.
assisting him. ‘Truckenmlller, fa~
mous Olympic wrestler, Hummell,
Reeck, Adamson, Lamp, as well as
several other letter men are reputable
linemen who should make hard going
for the speedy Pioneer backfield. In-
cidentally, the game will demonstrate
the effectiveness of the coaching of
the new Cornell mentor, Coach Rich—
ard Barker.
