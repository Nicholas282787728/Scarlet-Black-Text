The Pioneer tr ntcn Li rug tlte
lead irt tlte dashes and hurdles, non
the Ames drral last wecli by a ten-
troint margin, the ﬁnal score being
70 1—3 to 60 2-3. The Cyclones showed
their strength in the middle and long
distance runs and pole vault while the
Grinneliians added the shot. discus anti
the jumps to their score.

The meet was rrrn off under
tremeiy nniavorahle conditions, a cold
wind making the tintcs slow arid crrt-
ting inches oi: the broad jump. Alnes
scored slams in hcth the mile and hali-
mile and tool: the ﬁrst two places in
the pole vault while Grinncll ﬁnished
one , two in the hurdles and shot and
discus.

Morgan Taylor had 1!- good day, Lak—
irtg foul- ﬁrsts and running anchor-
man on the relay which decided the
outcome oi the meet. His ﬁrsts were
in the hurdles and the broad and high
jump.

The mile relay, the last and decid-
ing event of the day, was one or the
most exciting races of the day. The
score hetore the event took place was
an 2-3 in 651-3 with Grinnell on the
long end, but a win by the Farmers
would have talten the meet by 1-3 of
a point. The ﬁrst three men oi, the
relay ga e Taylor a short lead and he
increased it to thirty yards. assuring

good nrcet.

As the dope stands on paper, the
contest is rather evenly divided ite-
tween the three schools, lowa, AJues
and Grinneii, though the Pioneers
seem to have a slight advantageover,
the Farmers due to therr ten point
victory last week and iowa through
her ability to cop seconds and thirds,
seems to hold the advantage over both.

Grinneii is practically conceded two
places in the hrrrdies through Taylor
and Green and the other place will
probably go to Mann of Town, who
rttay nose out Green for second place.
