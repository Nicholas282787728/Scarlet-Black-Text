Sir Leo points out’Jhe money bor-'

, rowed from America was spent in buy-
ing American food and materials at ex-
l orbitant war prices and points out

that the interest to he charged during,

the he‘d. sixty years Will amount to
_two million dollars more
principal.

i “The American war debt settlement
may he truly characterized its the
most amazing War indemnity ever ar-
,rauged in the history of lilankind . . ,
lwhuever last by the war, the United
States made enormous gains by it.

iAmeriCit is now a much richer conn—l

try than in 1914.

“Pay?
Iare paying. Nevertheless, speaking
'as one of the payers 1 say
‘is monstrous that Great Britain, who
paid out more than America, risked
immeasurably more than America, lent
_ as much as America, fought more than
'twlcc as long as America, and lost 1,-
aoooon men to America's 100,000,
should be paying a huge war indem-
nity to help pay the taxes or the rich-
est citizens of the world."
