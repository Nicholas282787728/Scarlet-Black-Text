SHIELD WILL BE AWARDED

Building Four “111 llet'en‘c th'rl'ill
Debate Shield; Forensic “'ill be
Ewluillt‘d to Men.

All open metlng for all men in col-
lege has been announced for next
Wednesday, December is, by the Grin-
nell Forensic.

Tile meeting will have three pur»
poses, to present Building Four with
the shield won in the Merrill prize de~
bate, to explain the constitution of the
Grinnell Forensic and the tryouts for
membership, and to holdashort dis-
cussion on sonle subject, if time per-
mits.

The holding of open forums for all
meil is one of the aims of the Forensic
and the meeting next Wednesday will
be the first opportunity which it has
had to invite the men as whole. The_
Executive council has been busy
with the Merlin debate and the vars-
ity schedule and intends to turn its
attention to the forensic needs of the
men as a whole as soon as possible.

Meeting Will lie Short

The meeting next Wednesday at
which all men in school are invited to
attend, will he held in the A, R. H,
auditorium. It will be a shol‘t'lneet-
ing and it is the intention to have it
last for only forty-five minutes,

The Merrill debate prize, which was
one well by Building Four in the in-
tel‘vdal‘nl debates in which she defeats
ed Dibble and Langan halls, is in the
nature of a shield, as a result of (le-
cision of the executive council of the
Grinuell Forensic, Buildings One
and Two will each receive $10 for
being rllnnel'ssup in the tournament
and the remainder of the $60 will go
to Building Four after the costs of
advertising and the price of the shield
have been deducted.

Tryouts Held After Christmas

it is the intention of the Forensic
to hold tryouts for membership in the
organization, shortly after Christmas.
The tryouts will probably consist of
memorized and extempore speeches;
their exact nature will be an-
nounced next Wednesday. Since
membership in the organization is
limited to twenty it is expected that
the competition for places will be
keen. All men who have debated in
an intercollegiate debate will be elm-
sidered members of the Forensic but
the election of varsity debaters is en-
tirely under the hands of the speech
department and in no way controlled
by the executive council of the Fol»
ensic,

The Forensic constitution provides
that open meetings shall be held
which every man in school is eligible
to attend and the meeting next Wed—
nesday will be the first of several that
will be open to all men. Later on
when the members are chosen it is
expected the meetings will take the
form of discussion on topics of inter-
est, but the first meeting will confine
itself mainly to the Merrill awards
and the explanation of the purpose of
the Forensic. A topic will probably
be discussed. however. if time per
lnits.

Four College Students

Four college students Will speak at
the morning services of the Baptist
Church tomoerW, on the relationships

Howell’s subject. Walter Ingram Will
speak on, “What the Baptist church
could do for Grinnell students." Marie
Edwards will talk on “What the Grip.

Pioneers May Travel
To Coast Next Fall

since the close of the football sea-
son, athletic director Huff has been
approached by parties on the Pacific
coast regarding- the possibilities of a
football gamc for Grinncll in Califor-
nia next fall.

Pomona or Occidental are the pos-

sible opponents and sonsiderable cor-
responllencc has already passed back
and forth. No definite arrangements
have been completed at this time and
the whole rsitudtloll stands rather
prohleniatical, In case such a game is
arranged. the contest will undoubteda
ly be played upon the completion of
the regular schedule,
Grinnell has never engaged in an
intersectional game of this type and
such an arrangement would be a
great boost to Pioneer athletics es
pecially in the far west.

Grinnell Students Do Not Work 30
Hard As In East, Say Instructors

“The average student at Griunell
does not work nearly so hard as as
he would in an eastern college or
university," said both l\ll‘, John \V.
Har umu, instructor in economics
and business administration and fora
merly a student at Brown University
and later at Harvard, and it How-
ard K. Beale, instructor in h 'tory and
previously a student at Chicago uni-
versity and later at Harvard, in an
interview with the scarlet and Black
reporter on a comparison and con-
trast of Grinnell with eastern col—
leges,

in a rather informal chat with Mr,
H -riman,'the first two men inter-
viewed, he discussed the differences
between the schools and the students
as he had seen them since he has been
here in G-rinnell, In general, be said,
students were nearly the same and the
methods of conducting classes were
also similar. The differences as he
saw them were in minor thing

Need Point System for Acti

“If students don't waste theii time,
I don't know what they do with it. I
think they sh ild have a point sys
tem for activr es if that is what is
taking their time. However I find
my dumbest students on the steps of

 

the A. R. H during chapel. social

:tcti cs are not as many or as in.»
led as fu custcru schools where there
are fraternitie . The time can scarce-
ly be taken in social flflnlrs."

“Exams are more of a formal af-
fair In the eas ,, he said when asked
about them. ~Iouesty is much the
same; there is the same tendency to
cheat, although it is not regarded as
good form At Brown they have a
custom of stamping the first man who
leaves lu an exam, which has a tend-
clicy to make him remain to the end
of the hour in order to avoid the pub-
licity."

No Triiditluus iu Grluuell

"And speaking of traditions, I think
there is an unholy lack of tradition
here. Have you really auy tradi-
tions?" offhand ! could think of very
few that had not been broken recent-
ly, as I mumbled my reply.

Speaking of pranks and prepping,
Mr. Harriman said, “Class fights and
pranks of that sort should not be
tamed down. Let them let out their
energies and then settle down. At
Brown there are three or four gaug
ngbts all over town at the first of
the year. Prepping should he more
on the humorous order and should
be done at the first of the year rather

Student Turns Down
Phi Beta Kappa Key

A student at the Univer ty
Kansas has refused his membership in
Phi Beta Kappa.

He stated that the grading system
was inadequate at the university and
said he did not believe that it was a
good judge of a student’s intelligence.

This is the ﬁrst instance known
when a student refused to be a Phi

13‘ Practice Sessions of
Pioneer Cage Men.

\Vith the effect of daily [)racﬁce
marking a vftst improvement in team
play the Scarlet and Black basket-
ball squad is taking on a more prom-
ising aspect each afternoon. Funda-
tnentzlls have been mastered in fair
shape and the great task which con»
fronts Couch Black is in deVeloping
team play and a strong offensive and
defensive Combination.

Scrimmages have been held every
afternoon with the squad divided into
two teams. Experimentation with
Various combinations and free sub~
stitution of reserves have taken a
conSlderable part at the practices.

Hurc Strong Combination

At present one of the strongest
combinations seems to be Capt. Wing
and Niblo at guards; Davis at center;
Month and Chase at forwards. Wing
looks be‘tter than ever at guard and
Nlblo, who hits been shifted frnm cen<
ter, handles the other position in good
shape.

Davis, raugy sophomore tackle from
the football squad, is it great Scrapper
and will make a strong bid for the
Divot Position, He lacks varsity ex—

per-rcuce aufl needs Considerable liol»

lsluug on his floor work.

Moran, a strong offensive luminary,
has a good chalice at one of the for-
Ward posltlous while Chase, regular
for uni last year, seems to have the
inside track as a ruuniiig mate right
now,

lla u y thlu'ds ’Out

At guards, Peterson, Hays, McLain
and Pederson are strong aspirants
who my step into a regular berth
any time. Peterson has showmsome
nice work the past week and he is
liable to relieve Nlblc. seelaud is a
strong contender for center and will
fumish Dnvis plenty of competition
for the position, injuries received in.
gcotball have hampered him a bit so
far and he-mdy go better in the next
few weeks. Dolfing, Lamb, Smiley
and Mark appear to be the class of
the reserve forward material and
Moran and Chase will have men
hands full holding down regular
berths. These reserves are practic—
ally on a par and their showings in
the near future will determine their
ranking.

Although the season is too early to
estimate the strength of the team, the
preseason showing is far from dis-
couraging. Galvin and Winter, Pio~
ueer guards who graduated last year.
left a great gap to fill in the defensive
play, and Eoge, center who also grad-
uated, left the pivot position without
an experienced contender. if these
places can be satisfactorily filled, the
team should compare favorably with
any dulutets which have represented
the Pioneer institution the last few
years.

the prize.

The couples met in the clubrooni at
7:30 o'clock and drew slips directing '

There they received their next in-
