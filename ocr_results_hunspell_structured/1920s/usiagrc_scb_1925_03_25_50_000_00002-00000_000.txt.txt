FOR ALL OF US

Much has been said about the sorry
plightpf the American artist. There
have been critics who have asserted
that the United States can never pra~
duce a great'writer, painter or com—

into the ring with "Mammonart,"' a
. book which tries to prove that Amer-

ica is hostile to creative genius.

Upton Sinclair throws his hat

There is a great deal to be said on
both sides of the question, We are
convinced that this continent is not
hostile to creative genius, for we have
produced eminent scientists and in-
ventors, worthy musicians. notable
teachers and political figures. These
men, we venture, are now honored be-

that in a very concrete fashion invent
or: have helped to make life more
nearly ideal for us. And in our 50‘
called ”uncultured state" we have had
horn in us a similar desire to reap the
material benefits of civic opera and
the home town symphony.

So far, we are inclined to appreciate
the creative artist in much the same
way that we revere a National League
pitcher. Chicago boasts about its op—
era and until a few years ago munlfii
cently permitted Harold McCormack
to pay the yearly deficit. Practically
every major city now has its sym—
phony orchestr We, here in lows.
are tremendously proud of our men
and women of letters. Watch an Io-
wan when he goes to New York. Says
the Iowan. "Oh, yes. you may have an
opera, but look at us! We have Ruth
Suckow, and John Fredrick, Thomas
Beer and Herbert Quick."

But when the Iowan gets home heiseems impossible to conduct a column'

occupy himself with Captain Billy or
"The Smart Set." ’
An Obligation

ft is up to us, we college students of
the present generation, to see that
America’s best is realized and that
popular taste does not condemn the
work of the true artist. it is for us to
encourage, stimulate and materially
help the worthwhile creative worker.

A. Edward Newton has said that in-
telligent people are under obligation
to buy books. We think he is quite
right. The author can live and produce
only so long as he receives remun—
eration. Grcnt him independence and
freedom and his work is likely to im-
prove. But when it istnecessary for
him to prostitute his art for the mo-
tion picture, or degrade it by seeking
the offices of nickel magazines we are
not likely to see any great improve
ment in American literature and art.
Encouragement docs not
merely a kind word. We have [0 as-
sume an active part in bringing out
the latent soul of America.
not expect to have a national litera-
ture if we will not purchase good
books. We cannot hope for n natlom
al drama of significance until we give
our genuine support to the better
plays of today, We will not see a
master painter evolve from American
soil until public taste rises above its
current satisfaction with magazine
covers.

If college has given us what it
seeks to give and ought to give, we

Editor of S. ti: E.

Dear Sir:

In reply to last week’s comment on
the Doric Column I believe it is only

who think otherwise in regard to your
“column fo pure beauty Why
stlangle the efforts of something that
is both unique and individualistic?
The Doric, in my estimation has never
yet been at “its wits end, " and if per-
sonalities cannot withstand a humm-
ous thrust only and then by what
grace will they be able to ward
the gal: of the world.
second to none as a Liberal Arts
school, are we to misconstrne the
meaning ‘ot Lilieral? After all, what's
the oddsl Let‘s have a bigger and
better Doric!

To the Editor of the Scarlet and
Black:

I wish to say a word concerning the
widely read and much talked about
Doric colounln which appears weekly
in the Scarlet and Block, There seems
to be some misunderstanding about
the motive and the circumstances of
Doric which I should like to cor-
reot. , ,

In the first place, Doric is not hard
pressed for material thereby necessi-
tating the making light of individuals.
I understand that there is usually an
abundance of material for the column
and' that often more is written than
there is room to puhlish. secondly. as
to the motive of the authors—Doric
was not originated to obtain npplanse'
ior its authors, and is not being con-
tinued for that aim. Arid lastly, it

or this nature entirely of things, leav-
ing people out of it altogether. If
such a thing were tried, the column
Would fall [In , for it takes people to
create interest. Things alone cannot
'do it. A combination of the two. as
‘has been the policy 01' Doric, is the
logical means of acquiring humor,

THE APPLE OF THE EYE.
By iiieuway Wcsoott—Tllc Dial Press.

At iirst glance one might think Mr.
‘Wescott’s first novel to be another I -
alistic view of rural life in the u
lern states. The same type (is “Ille

novel of several yeitrs ago. On [ur-
thcr search, however, one finds there,
is a great deitl or matter in this hook
’whicb will stand oousidcruhle contem-
’plation.

The novel is a story of spiritual
tragedy; the clash of Pagan and puri-
tanical view about the sex question
and questions which run parallel with
it. The adroitness with which Mr.
“Veswtt deals with situations, tends.
in many places, toward the superb,

Mr. \Vescott describes the beauty or
his Wisconsin setting, the book would

End Hall, as she is called, is a one -
jtcter of great power. She becomes in
”many places the subject for sympath
in others one develops an intense d

like for her ccpl-iciousness. Her wick»
sdness is covered up by the author in
a manner so clover that one sees her
motives more than they 'do her sinful-
ness. She reminds one of a picture in
which the coarse parts are painted ow
er with bright colors and the beautiful
places stand out so that the onlookcr
‘ls deceived into looking at the beauty
of the scene and consequently does not
notice the poor places.

Don is somwhat more real, He is a
,modern young man who lives within
himself mostly from choice and partly
from circumstance. He relies on

pletely wrecks one family and almost
a second with his lnodern ideas.
'Through all this trouble, one stays by

the remains a lovable character.

The minor characters are made to
Iplay their parts well, indeed. They
,continnelly liven up the story and odd
‘zest' and reality.

“The Apple of the Eye” may not he

those who seek entertainment onlv,'foi-
it touches far deeper than that. partly
