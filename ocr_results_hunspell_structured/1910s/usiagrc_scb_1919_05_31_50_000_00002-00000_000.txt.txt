rItova'G UP.

With this issue the present manage-
ment of The Scarlet and Black ends,
and on Wednesday a. new management
will assume control for the coming
Year.

It is with no little regret that we
sever connections with the paper we
have held so long, but it is with con-
‘sidernhle pleasure that we look over
the past year. We have made mis-
takes, but what paper does not? We
have failed to obtain various nmrs
items of interest, but on the Whole We
feel that we have realized our greatest
Ambition, that of making The Scarlet
and Black a news paper, and a news
paper that has published college news
and college opinion in an unbiased

. incuuer.

And as for our editorial policy, we
would not change it in the slightest
detail. ‘VeJiave Worked at all times
with the interest of the college at
heart, and tho some oi our sugges-
tions have been frowned on by those
in authority, we were ﬁrm in our con-
victions and would repeat our opinions
here if space would permit. it We
can feel that we have in any Way con-
tributed to a greater Grinnell, then we
shall feel that our work here has not
been in Vain,

To the incoming editor and business
manager, with whom we have been
more or less intimately aeouainted
during the last two years, we ex-
(and our best wishes. Both men are
exceptionally Well ﬁtted tor-their- new
positions, and both will have at all
times the best interests of Grinnell in
mind.

To the staff With Whom We have
worked during this last year, We as
editor and business manager 'wish
to express our sincere appreciation.
Co-operation has contributed more
than any other group or factors to-
wartl the success—ifindeed, it has been
n sllccesswf The Scarlet and slack
during our term of management
Without the Comperdtion which has
alw been in evidence We could
never have published our paper.
rAt the beglnning 01' our managerial
career It year ago We had many plans
in mind for the improvement of The
Scarlet and Black, some of Which We
discovered were impracticable and in‘h
possible. Others had to be omitted
due to the numerous changes in the
management occasioned by enlist—
ments. We are limping, however, for
the realization of plans in the future
by the new management, which will
contribute to the betterment of GTiIiA
nell, of which we have often dreamed.

———G—
A N APPRECIATION.

it would he wrong were we to pass
hour the management or The Scarlet
and Black without expressing our any
prcciation of the assistance given us
by the business men or Grinnell dun
ing the past year. Their patronage
has made it possible to put out as coma
plete a paper as ever berore, despite
the unusual conditions arising from
the war, We thank them for their aid.

To the entire herald lorce, Mr. w, G.
nay, Mr. A. L Erlshic, the "make—up
man," the"1ino man", and every other
member of the force who has assisted
no in issuing the Scarlet and Black
during our term oi office, we express
our hearty appreciation. They have
given a great deal oi their time in
helping us and their many suggestions
luvs been timely and welcome,

Her program consisted of several

well, and her voice was especially
clear and mellow, qualities which
made her singing extremely pleasing.
“Abide, Thou Pretty Dreamer" was the
best or the ﬁrst group. The “Madame
Butterfly" song was very creditably
done. The last four numbers closed
the program very pleasingly. Mrs.
Alma rulicr Pierce accompanied her.
