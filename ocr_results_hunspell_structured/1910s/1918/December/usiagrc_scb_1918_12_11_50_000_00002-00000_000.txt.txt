JOIX THE RED CROSS.

The drive for the American Red
Cross will begin next Monday, [accelllr
ber 16th, and calitlnllc (or one week.

An effort will be put forth to make
this drive one hundred per Cent effic-
ient. Last year, nearly every one in
College joined the Red Cross. Rivalry
was strong between the different cots
tages ftnd buildings at the Quadrangle
and the men's dormitories to become
the ﬁrst one hundred per Cent cottage
or the ﬁrst one hundred per cent build-
in .

it is of as much vital importance
this year, as it was last. that the drive
be a success. The Work of the Red
Cross is by no means completed, now
that the War is over. It Still has vast
duties to perfoml.

If you joined last year renew your
pledge. Griunell must again, be at one
hundred per Cent college.

SOLDIER To STUDENT.

(From the Oberlin Review)

The world was surprised at the allies
rity with which its students lay down
their books and took up arms in be
half of freedom. This metamorphosis

from students to soldiers was as start- .

ling and as easily accomplished as the
transformation of tadpoles into frogs.
Yet no one could quite believe it, and
Germany’s skepticism as regards this
phenomenon has lost her victory.

But now the process must be re-
versed. Soldiers must hccomc stur
dents; men or action must become men
of thought; ideas must he wielded inc
stead 01' hayonets. And in this we face
a problem even more difficult than the
one which we have met. It was this
very same difficulty that our late
friend Dr. Jekyll was uuahle to solve
in his fascinating but fatal experi-
ments in psychosphysical transmutav
tioo. He could become the morosc
Mr. Hyde at will, hut the rub came to
return to the genial Dr. Jekyll.

The gears of the wheelsin our heads
must be reversed Bernhardi must be
scrapped for Gcrgson. drill must be
transferred from"tlle ﬁeld to thc hlaok-
hoard, and such things as French ire
regular vcrhs must take the place of
Enddclds. Now will be truly tested
the hoast o! the Amcrican army that it
is pccrl ss in resourcefulness and
adaptability.
dicrs to students is one that will chal.
lcngc both grit and ﬁghting qualities
to tho full. Oberlin has conﬁdence
that her sons will go over the top in
scholarship as brilliantly as they have
done in war.

A ntTION-mei CELEBRATION.

Saturday and Sunday were set a run
for a nationrwitle celebration of Great
Britain's part in the war. It is ﬁtting
that Grilllicll should take some notice

of this celebration.

In lieu of an editorial on this sub-
met, the scarlet and Black is puhlish-
ing, with thc permission of the au-
thors, the preface to “Imperial Eng-
land." a book written by Professors
Payne and Lavoll. A supplementary
paragraph has been added by Mr.
Payne. in view of the fact that the
book was published before the close of
the war.
