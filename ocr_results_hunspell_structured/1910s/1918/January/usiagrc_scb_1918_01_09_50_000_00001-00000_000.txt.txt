“It is our great task now to put Hiln

Coach Mac Eneirl‘on’s protegcs began
preparation for their ﬁrst game.

Show Good Form

Scrimmages arc being held every
night, and the class of basketball
shown bodes no good for the teams to
be played this season. \ionrlay night e
chalk-talk was given before the regu—
lar practice at which a few plays were
given out. The coach their followed
this by a general tail: to the squad, ate
ter which practice Was held.

Augustine will probably hold down
thc center job in the game with Carle—
ton. He is rapidly getting into form
and has acquired a good eye for the
iron ring, goth from the ﬁeld and the
foul line. Garner and Hammond look
to he the best choice for forwards thus
far in the season, although Dickerson,
Macy and Gahcline are all going good.

Sinners Will Not Play

With Somers out until the second
semester bccause of a “can," Gass and
\Vassenaar are next in line for a guard
position. \Vassenaar is good on break—
ing up passes and Grass plays a heady
game all the time. Diinit has also
been showing up well at this position
audit is not at all improbable that he
may get a chance to show what he can
do Saturday night.

Because the men are required to
take military drill on Monday night,
practice is held in the evening, instead
of at the regular time in the after-
noon.
