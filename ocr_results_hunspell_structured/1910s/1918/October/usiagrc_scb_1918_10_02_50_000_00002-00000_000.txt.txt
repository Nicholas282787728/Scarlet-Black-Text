Communications train students and
faculty members will be welcomed at
the Seailet and Black ottice.

Thru the "What Do You Think?“
celuinn established last year, students,
faculty and alumni had an open rot-uni
where they could express their v w

good articles, not exceeding co
words in length, will be accepted at
the cities, and the name withheld from
publication if desired. Criticism, it
adverse c cisin, will be both liclptul
and con tructive

At uieditiiii for discussion of opinions,
such as communications, can be made
of d. not value if used adviscdly by
the general student body, and by all
those interested in a. greater GIMP

The new administration at the Quad
rangle will alibi-d a chance for an in-
tcrcstiiia coinoerisonoi dormitory gm
crnment. Men in the barracl will
be governed by military discipline,
subject to orders at all times.

The Quadrangle administration will
seek to make student government
the ideal. By having as many students
as possible do the administration work
of house government, the rule will not
be restricted as it has in the past, to

' in each house.

Eve i one will have a share in the
sen-government ot the various houses.
it is 'a challenge to the girls to see
what they can do in governing them-
selves as a group. It is an experis
ineiit which, it snccessiul, will have
fal'vl‘eachl'llg results. It it does not
succeed, the government will revert to
faculty rule.

Clinnet-d Conditions.

The tormal enlistment yesterday oi
Grimlell men in the s. A, T. c, marks
a deﬁnite change in Gl'innell life and
traditions. Tin-u this change, much
will he added to our lite liore, anti
again many things of former years
will be talien away.

The inadvisabilitv or men engaged
in active military tr niiig taking part
in "outside activities” is anpai-cut. This
will necessarily arrect many or the
student activities and organizations in
which men in the past have taken part.
For example, it seems necessarv to
give no the men's literary societies.
which in turn, will make practically
,impo. sible, debating, and other terms
or speaking contests.

IL is not diiricult toi thc old student
to call to mind many other activ s

which are likewise affecte(l,~lhe col-I

lege paper, the annual, the student
council.

In spite of fill these changes, wt: are
1001 iig for a greater Gi-iilncll. We

inn, accustom ourselves to these

changed conditions, amt] Expect sllll
