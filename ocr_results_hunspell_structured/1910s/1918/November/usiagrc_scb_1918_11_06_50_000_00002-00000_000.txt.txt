There is eonsid ~ahlc rejoicing in
Gl'inllell over the overwhelming deleat
or Drahe at Des iloines last Saturday.
in view or the tact that the scarlet and
hlaclv eleven has heen practicing under
serious handicaps, itp until last week,
the honor due the coach and the team
is all the indie great. It demonstrates
v: 'tt the Griiiiiell Spirit can do.

Next" Saturday, the Grinch eleven
will meet Cce on her home ﬁeld. The
relative sti-ciwth oi the two schools
is little loiown. There is no question
but what the team \\ l play the, game
with their characteristic ﬁghting spirit,
It is up to the students to hack the
team. The team should he made to
reel that the, student hody is as much
interested in a siiccesstni fuhthall sea:
son as in previous years.

At present, Grlnneil has‘an onen
date on Norelltbcr 16th. Negotiations
are under way to schedule a game with
either an army team from Camp Grant
or a Great Lakes naval training team,
to be play-ed in ai-innell,

Local tans are assured, however, of
seeing one good toothall game on Ward
ﬁeld, when Grilmell meets Cornell Na-
veniher 23rd. The game with the pure
ple and white wai-i s every year
proves one of the harde. sfnllght con-
tests of the season, and trom all indie
cations, the rival eleven is up to slautle
ard this yea it is this game that
usually decides the conference cham-
plonship,

it present plans
scarlet eleven will meet Iowa on
Thanh-sawing Day, However, the
game has not been deﬁnitely sched-
uled as yet. In view ot the cancellas
tion ot the game hetween the two
schools earlier in the season, toothall
tans- over the state are anxious to
have this game scheduled. Judging
lrom the dope sheet, an exciting con-
test would he assured.

In spite of many dittieulties this
year, hoth in regard to pracllclng'dlltl
the arranging ot a schedule, Grinnell
has a ioothall team to he proud oi, and
one which merits the enthusiastic sill»
port oi the students. Lct's heat Coo

CHAPEL.

The re-eiioning ct chapel Monday
morning iias welcomed by students
and taciilty allke. For the lost two
weeks, there has been something
lacking in Criminal] hie. It is very
easy to become detached trom the col—
lege when one does not attend chapel
services.

These services are really the center
or Grillnell lite, They fulfill the need
tor tellowship, as well as the spiiitiial
and intellectual needs or every one.
Those tiltecn minut every morning,
are one of the mo important contri—
hutions ci-tniicll has to otter. Why not
resolve to attend chapel regularlyt
