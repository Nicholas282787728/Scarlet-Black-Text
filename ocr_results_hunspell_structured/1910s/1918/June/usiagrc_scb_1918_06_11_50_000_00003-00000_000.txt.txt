.“DBJEUT OF WAR ,IS TO GIVE
UHRIST PLACE IN WUHLD”--MAIN

Baccalaureate Sermon Is Broad and Inspiring—Says World War Is
But An Episode in World Movement—Believes War Will Be
cide Whether We Are to Have Freedom Under God
or Serfdom Under Tyrant

RECONSTRUCTIDN MUST BE BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF JESUS

That the present world war is hcillg.‘
waged upon an eternal issue, the will“
to freedom under God and the Will [0
power under anyone who_happens to

have the power, was emphasized by
President J. 1:1. T. Main in his baccar

laureate sermon to the college grad-
uating class 'in the Congregational

church on Sunday morning. I! was

one or the broad gauged, inspiring ser—
mons, which Gl'lnnell people have
learned to expect or President Main on
these occasions,

"Shall we work and ﬁght with the

n Jesus," he asked, "in freedom ot

lit, or shall we subscribe to the
icy actuating our‘ adversaries, that

n is a creature ot the herd, to be
. .de eliicicnt as an instrument oi the
state?

Enemies Fight: Democracy.

“This is the policy. this is the‘reli-
gion or our adversaries and under its
inspiration they have attacked the vi—
tal principles of our government, our
religion and our lire. They have made
war against every principle oi democ—
racy, against the right of seli—ownen
ship and salt—determination and hence
they are waging war against the hu—
man soul. And what will man take
in exchange tor his soul? Ask a man
with whom and tor whom we, are
righting, ‘What shall it proiit a man
i! he should gain the whole world and
lose his own soul?‘

"If we are sure for ourselves of the
trpth brought to us in the lite ot Jesus
and it we are loyal Americans and hat
lieve in what the ting symbolizes, we
know the truth. We know it suiti—
ciently well to understand how to act.
Shall we be traitors or shall wa be
loyal?"

The general theme or the address
was “The World Order." The text
was found in the words from Exodus
14. . “And the Lord said unto Moses,
‘Wherefore criest thou unto me? Speak
unto the children or Israel that they

, go forward.’
Expluins World Order.

“The world order." said President
rights or humanity as against the
Main. "is the advancement of the 1
rights or kings. We need only sayi
that there was one speciiic time when
the struggle tor the right world order
became a fixed point in the history or
the race. One man announced it, in
terms that are still pregnant with
meaning and will be so tor centuries
to come. He gave for all time the
right spirit to the principle or liberty,
oft equality and fraternity. He an—
nounced, before it was written, the
Declaration ct Independence.

"The world war now going on is but,
an eddy, an episode, in the world,

”The world is not in battle against
the kaiser merely. The aroused con—
science of mankind ls in arms against
a system l'epr(senled by the kaiser,
which would undermine and destroy
the moral standards of the world. The
war will not end even though peace
is declared and the armies return
home, until the real issue tor which
we are fighting is settled,

Speaking directly to the members
of the class. President Main said in
conclusio

“Beloved: 0nd conviction, I trust.
Will take possession of your souls to-
day; the conviction that we are part—

and those of us who are 'over thei‘e.‘
