ORINNELLIANS NOT OHUROHOOERS

Prof. )Inllnck Believes Students D0

Nott Attend Cllllrcll n5 Formerly

"Grinnell has ceased to be a church
going college," was the remarkable
statement made by Professor H. \v.
Matlach in his talk at Y last Thurss
day evening, when the subject ot
church affiliation was discussed.

ilr. Matlach went on to say that
“this is not as it should be. I can't
believe that the men ot Grinnell are
less Godlike than formerly, but they
give the church the 'gu-by.”'

Fred Hazard also pointed out that
the college man should become nfﬁl
ated with sonic church for two rea~
sons: Because he is a progressive,
and because in so doing he will not
lose the inlluence of his home church.

goers is the fact that W. D. Gritfith's
magniﬁcent neuuart spectacle, "an
tolerance," is coming to the Colonial

"Intolerance" is said to he the most
stupendous theatrical amusement ever
created. It reveals four periods of
World histol'yianctcnt Babylon, Judea
in the time of the Nazarene, Medieval
Paris, and modern American life.

nlae Marsh and Lillian Gish are
among the screen celebrities having
the most important roles.

Some idea. of the tremendous size
of this master-work may be had from
the statement that it cost twoimillion
dollars, employed 125,000 people, made
use of 7.500 horses and 1,500 chariots.

The Chemistry Club will present
some moving pictures in Alumni hall
auditorium Monday evening at 8
o’clock. “Silver" and other subjects
or popular intel'esthll be shown. The
pictures are not technical in nature,
and every one is invited to come and
enjoy them.

As the college autho ities have
