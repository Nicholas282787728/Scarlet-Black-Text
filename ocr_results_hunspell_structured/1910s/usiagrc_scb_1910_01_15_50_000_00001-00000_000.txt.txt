Approval of Prcsrnt Conic Ollalifidtl
Di/ Conﬂillalls that it is
Reformed.

No question is oi more immediate in-
tcrcst to the average college man in
the country than the probable outcome
oi the tootball agitation. The news-
papers and magazines are iull oi sug
gestions tor changes and modifications
oi the present genie, while not a tow
have declared in iavor oi doing away
with the game and the substitution oi
the soccer or rugby game, neither oi
which seem to be so dangerous as the
Great American College game,

some time ago a suggestion was
made in the columns or the Scarlet
and Black that Crinnell might take
the lead in bringing about a more
wholesome condition in Iowa college
circles by leading a movement to sub-
stitute the soccer or rugbr'game for
tho intercollegiate contests oi next
fall.

As the solution oi this question both
in lows and in the country as a whole
rests entirely with the college iacul-
ties, an etiort has been made to as-
certain the opinion oi the Crinuell
laculty on three questions, relating to
this discussion. Twenty-eight opinions
were secured on the three ioliowing
questions:

1. Do you desire to see the present

11. A collection at typical poetry,
iorni oi iootball continued as a college
sport?

ti. It not, what action would you
recommend?

3. Would you iavor the substitution
oi the soccer or Rugly gsmel

The answers indicate that there is
a wide diiierence oi opinion as to the
host step to take. Upon one point all
were agreed, namely, that the present
situation was unsatisiactory. As to
the best means oi improving it. there
were a variety oi opinions expressed.

in answer to the first question
twelve oi those interviewed declared
themselves in iavor oi continuing the
present some with necessary modiﬁ-
cations. This opinion was pretty well
represented by the iollowing intert
Tim

"Yes. 1 believe in looiball. it seems
to me that the game has a place in
our college lire. Our mrn demand a
manly, American game, and the cur
tire college community will proiit
from properly controlled iootball.

However, the game should be medic
sled and what is ltnown as “olljeo
tionahle icaturcs" should he eliminal.
ed. Indir lions point to radical tier
parture from tho old style oi iootbali

.very soon. Itules encouraging irecr
use at substitutes would improve the
game and stringency in mcdical ins
spection of pin S would lli'cl'i’lilt
many misc chill": being made against
the game. The main iault oi iootbail
as played tod _ lies not in the game
itscli but in tl abuse oi it, and ex-
acting and wideralvtilic oiiicials and
eligibility committees have power to
correct most oi thcsc abuses. Football
is one or. tho most misunderstood oi
games played today and when the prin-
ciples oi the game are understood by
the public, the inilucncc will be much
better.

Neither Soccer or Rugby fool:
ball can become the great American
game without considerable modiiica-
tion, and thus modiiied they probably
would not he radically dliiereut irom
our game as it will be played in a tow
years."

Fourteen expressed themselves as op-
posed to a continuation oi the present
game on any basis. The opinion oi
this portion oi the iaculty is best sun:-

DISCUSSED L‘Y PRES MUN
IN “AMERICAN COLLEGE"

In All Able Article Show; Whom the
College Hits a Gl‘cat
Opportunity.

“What is the troubic with the col-
lege?" in a rccent number oi the
American College President Main re-
plies, the lack oi a principle oi unity.
and the subordination oi the man, the
human interests, to the material
growth oi the college. The iunda-
mental thing tor the college to achieve
is a new birth ior the man. The sole
lege iails iii-st on account or lack at
personal direction oi the student. tor
whom the college exists. The college
is trying to educate men tor citizen-
ship, Therctore the community inter
ests must be emphasized. The relig-
ious, social and athletic interests may
be utilized tor the highest development
oi the institutional spirit oi unity.

President Main says in part: "It is
impossible tor the college to do every.
thing. One oi the chiei causes or the
inciiectivcness oi present day college
education is the attempt on the part
oi the college to occupy the whole
iicld oi edlli‘tliion and to keep pace
with the enlargement ot its bounded“
ies without providing tor any centrals
izing interest, The eiiiciency oi edu-
cation is to he testco not merely by
a man's success in commercial life, but
by his ability to transcend the more in-
cidents and (acts oi existence.

One oi the hesetting sings ol the col-
legc is the lack oi personal direction.
It accepts young people and turns
them loose in a "treasure house or tbs
world's bounties,“ They are bewild-
ered. in giving attention to courses.
laboratories, equipment, etc, the col-
lege has almost lost sight or the man
tor whom the whole thing is planned.
The period or expansion and enlarge-
ment is almost past; now is the time
ior correction, adaptation and unitica.
tion.

The ilrst obligation upon the college
is to give the right spirit, the right at-
titudc oi mind to the students. whdtp.
er he is to be physician, engineer, or
clerk, success in any work gets its
largest iruitoge item a good under-
standing oi men and capacity to deal
with them on the broad iundamcntal
principles that underlie good govern-
ment, good business. good manners and
good soci Tile emphasis must be

thusiasms, spiritual things. Facts and
