”An entire nation of students is is»
suing a challenge to the young men
and women of America today to teach
them the gospel of Christ," declared
Edward H. Munson, '09, a member of
the Grinnell- ~Chilm Band and for the
past two years the national student
Y. M. c. A. secretary in China. He
will soon take up his second slxryeul‘
period in the Y. M. C. A. seivice or
that country.

Thousands To War.

“Never has there been such a con-
centration of strain, human energy,
and suffering as that which faces th'e
world today in the European war,"
the speaker began. “The only country
whose resources, homes,‘aud young
men are intact is the United states.
Canada has given 75 per cent of her
students to the war, and Germany 45
per cent, while in the last _two years
23,00c students and alumni of Oxford
and Cambridge universities have gone
m the front. Yet we demand only
20,000 to evangelize the world.”

Sell Kore Balls in Cllillll.

"The physical side of the life of the
average Chinaman is far moi-e'dech
oped than the physical side of the
American," he continued. “More buseA
balls and Valley—balls have been sold
in China during the last two years
than during the same time in America.
for every school has developed athletic
teams among its students. Basketball
is one of the favorite sports."

$10,000 For Bibles.

lilr. Munson emphasized the fact
that even the leaders of the far eastern
empire are eager for the gospel. One
man, he said, donated $10,000 to be

used in purchasing testaments for thcY

heathens of the country. This man
considered the Bible for better than
the Chinese classics, which the aver»
age native holds paramount to all lit-
erature. He stated that the Chinese
government gave a plot in the" center
of the Forbidden City, the scat of the
royal palace‘ and a strictly Confucion»
ist settlement, to be used as. a meeting
place for Christian sci-iicces.
Rotten Conditions.

The need of Christian doctors is
particularly urgent, according to hlr.
Munson. While in the United states
we have one doctor for every Six hun-
dred people. the proportion in China
is one to two and a half million. Con»
ditions of sanitation are in a deplor»
able state, as is evidenced by the fact
that sixty per cent of the children uur
dcr two years of age die every yea ,
primarily because of impure water and
open sewerage systems. "Every
church," he added, “must serve foi-
50,000 of the population."

Wils Track )lall.

When a student in Glilmell, Mr.
Munson was a prominent member of
the track squad, having carricd off
several honors in the mile and balls
mile. He was also a leader in the
Y. M. C. A. He left Grinnell yesterday
afternoon, to start immediately upon
his return trip to China. He will board
a steamer at San Francisco next wch
nesday, and, sailing by way of Hones
lulu and Japan, will arrive in China
April first, to resume his work in the
Y. M. C. A. of that country.

Scenes of blood stained soldiers, of
shells bursting in midrflir, of giant
guns sending forth their death charges
and of soldiers living their dangerous
lives on the European war front, when
portrayed by a motion picture and
when described by Frederick l’itlmel',
famous war correspondent, kept a. ca~
pacity audience in breathless attention
at the Colonial theater last Saturday
night.

The illustrated address which Mr.
Palmer gave under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A. Lecture Course mans
ageinent, was 2t graphic description of
ﬁle horrors of the European war as
conducted in France. In it were res
latcd many of the experiences of Mr.
Palmer himself while acting as the
war correspondent at the front for
the American press.

Seldom before in Grinnell have such

bcart rending tales of actual warfare‘

been told. The capture of German
prisoners in actual battles, the doctor—
ing of wounded men, and scenes of
dead trench defenders were portrayed.
Scenes of villages before and after
complete bombardment were shown on
the screen. And the big guns of all
different kinds were shown in actual
operation

“The French military svstcni is the

A glowing tribute was paid by iii-.T

Palmer to Norman Hall, a Grinncll

Whether or not baseball shall be
droppcd as a varsity sport depends
largely on the success of the coming
season. After voting to discontinue
baseball. at a meeting early in the
winter, the faculty reconsidered their
action only after they were convinced
jtliat a number of students really de-
sired the game, and decided to allow
an abbreviated schedule this year, but
to abolish the varsity game finally if
it was not well supportcd during the

After playing a listless game the
first half, the Gi-iuneil five came back
with a rush in the second period and
decisively trimmed the Coe team 24-10
on the local court Saturday night.

The presence of Augustine in the
linerup was undoubtedly a big factor
in the scarlet and hlack victory. The
big center showed all his old time
speed and seemed none the worse for
his forced vacation of three weeks. He
not only addco lile to the whole team,
but copped one basket the first period
and two the second, as well as holding
Rogers of Coe scoreless.

Worth Starts Scoring.

Gl'innell started the scoring in the
initial period with a basket by Worth
soon after the opening whistle sound—
ed. A goal from foul by Swan added
a point, and then the Coe bunch starta
cd with a ringer by Martin. The two
teams played neck and neck the rest
of the half, neither showing much real
basketball form. The half ended 7-5
in favor of the locals.

The second half was an entirely dib
ferent story. Both fives opened up
with some real speed. Norris copped
a basket, quickly followed with a free
throw by Yuill and a ringer by Franks.
Martin made a basket, making the
score 104} in favor of the crimson and
gold. The Gl'llmell fans had visions
of the Aines game, and even worse, of,
shattered championship hopes. They
