the U'nitcd States declared a state or
war with Germany. He decided to
ﬁght for the United states and cast his
luck with our iorces. He says that he
has bcen in almost every camp in the
cast and south and has been working
on the S. A. T. 0. plans this summer.

"Tile C nnell unit has made very
good progress considering the great
handicap of not having unitoims for
all the men. The thing that must be ‘
instilled into the men is pep and
spirit,” said Capt. Adams today. “A
band is one of the best means known
to do this.” He hopes to get enough
men together to form a hand {or bat-
talion. Another thing that he noticed
while watching the men drill Friday
is that the lion-coins and oilicers have
pop and can give it to their men. He
says that it is most essential for the
ofticcrs to have spirit and next in
value is for the men to get it trom
tlicu- oilicers, llniiorins will increase
the suaopincss of the drill and the
actual precision nlhuy»fold. .

Captain Adams was very favorably
impressed with the conditions here and '
‘witll the college and town. The men
impressed him as willing to take hold
in the right spirit and push to the lust
,ouncc He commented on the dorms,
or barracks as they are now called,
,saying that they were without a doubt
the best hc had seen. “The town at
Grmnell is an especially clean and
.pretty town and the buildings are
much above the average." He com~
§iiicnted cspeciztlly on the postotlice
and the city library. "They are a
credit to any town". he said.
