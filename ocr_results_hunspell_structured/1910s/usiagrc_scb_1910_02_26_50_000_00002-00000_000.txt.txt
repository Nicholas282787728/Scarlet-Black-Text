VITAL Ins-only.

How many or the men and women of
the college could intelligently listen
to a discussion oi some of the pressing
problems that coniront the American
people at this time, to say nothing
of an intelligent discussion them-
selves? Probably there has never been
a time in the last twont, e years
when there was more of interest and
or more vital importance to tnr iuture
citizens than there is at present. What
do the men and the women or the col-
lege know about the currency and
banking questions, the problems or law
enforcement and the shitting of have
ernmental lorees such as are taking
place today? Ability to at least nine
derstztnd those issues will lie the cri-
‘terion of a good citizen a low years
