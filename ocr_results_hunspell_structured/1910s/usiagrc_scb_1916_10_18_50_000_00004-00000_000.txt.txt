truth is that most henrors must row
for their plcnsnrc on such llooling
fancies as they can gnthcr from the
sin-[nee hints of the titles and on the
plalllst’s ability to Vildllze those sket-
ones for them by the glztmor of his

saying that no other liiusicinn has
(lone (his more successfully in this City
than Mr. Hermann did it yesterday at?
tei'noon.”

ii, '1‘, Pati'lmr in the Boston Tran-
script gave the following judgmen
“If over at victor deserved the rewards
of his prowess, not only here in Bus;
ton, but in all America and Europe as
well, it is Mr. Hoimnnn. He has won
his new place among pianists by no
emphasized appeal of personality, by
none of the adventitious exploitation
01 What is called shrewd management.
He has gone before his audiences and
played with programs that assumed
standards among them as high as his
own, that exacted much in attention
and appreciation, that made no chi~
cessions to easy and trifling pleas-
ill-es."

To quote from Karletun Hacket of
the Chicago American: “What makes
Hofmanu seem to us the greatest pig
ztnlsl of the day is the sincerity with
which he devotes all his powers to the
expl'essian of the beauty of music—
not to aslmiish, not to dazzle, not to

-i»iu our applause by mntchless teats,

but to bring it."

Vl-ZSI’ERS ADDRESS 0:1an
BY REVERF ‘1) lilitlii’ 0!!
BIG DES MOINES CHURCH

“We must not close our eyes to the
reality about us; that would- he the
expedient of a coward," said Rev. Mr,
Kirby, pastor of the’ Plymouth Congre-
gational church of Des Molnes in his
Vesper talk last Sunday.

”Twilight,” he sold, "we are accus-
tomed to consider as the hour of re-
miniscing, the time of the thoughtful
mood, of introspection; but it hides
much. It is the web which softens
and ldcalizes, Who refuses to see his
own sin in the strong light 0! the sun
fcrieits the possibility of ever seeing
his true soul. Sclvntion is never in
moral delusion."

“There are,” Reverend Kirby said in
conclusion, “two courses in life, to
seek to escape to sllence,—to the mer-
ciful indistinctness of twilight where
there is only light enough to see, and
the critical is unexpressed; or to step
boldly into the light of the morning,
where every horror of sin is revealed."

the Seniors yesterday afternoon when
Lorin palmer and Ralph Pottle in o.
iast game defeated Helen Simmons and
Floyd Stansbei'x'y, representing the
Juniors. ‘

This was probably as hard as any

both teams were made up 0! experi-

Juniors tied them in the second set,
