DIGKERSUN ASKS BOOKS
FURSULDIEAT BAMP

Former Librarian Who Is Now In
Charge of Camp Library
Asks for Aid

L. L Dickerson, lormer college li-
brarian and now lihr an at Camp
Doniphan, Oklahoma, wants books and
maga"iies for “his" men. He needs
tlnr more sacks each week.

“We distributed during December.
45,000 books and magazines to the Eels
lows in quarantine," he writes. “They
want everything but Greek, Latin and
needlework books When our little
Ford starts oirt wrtli a load for distri-
bution, we are completely surrounded
by men hungry for something to read,"
writes the former librarian.

A story is told about one of the fel-
lows who received a copy of 0. Hen-
ry's stories. He tor-e up the book into
separate stories so that a number
could use it at the same time. When
at last the ﬁrst story got back to him,
he could scarcely recognize the title.

Books of adventure are read the
most, according to Dicker-son, especial-
ly those by Owen Wister, Rex Beach

, and Jack London. Poetry comes next
by Riley, Dunbar, Brooke and Seegar.
Then popular ﬁction by Porter, Wright
and 0. Henry. Text books of History
and French are worn “lirnber” by the
college men. Even war hooks of per»
sonal narratives are in demand. Late
magazines are literally devoured en
masse.

students who have novels, text
books or magazines to send to Mr.
Dickerson should leave them at the
desk in the library. "Five hundred
books by Saturday noon" is the slogan.
