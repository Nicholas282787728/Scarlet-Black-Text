The .\lav chti .rl opened last night,
with a delightlrrl program givcn b the
orator-lo society, Richard czerwonty,
violinist, and Lucile Tewksbu so~
prano. The audience was not so large
as that or iornrer year , a tact to be
regretted because oi' the attractivoircssl
oi the concert tor a wide variety ol
people,

This is the rirst time, at least in re-
cent years, that Cr-innell people hare
had the opportunity to hear a large,
vellrtl'nlued chorus sing withnrrt ac-
companiment. The elicct was cer
tainly beautit'ul. The tour parts were
balanced to a nii'ety, and for the most
past were able to produce that one
voice eitect, which gives ulluccampdn»
ied inusic its artistic charm.

The ﬁrst number was undoubtedly
the most popular one. it was reii-
tiered with more spirit and precision
than any iollou-ing iL Other iiumbers
especially good were the two selcotioris
ironi Old French, "Flonl Lyons As i
Journeyed,“ and the "Christmas Song."

Richard L“ rwonky, the concert
meister oi the orchestra, played two
groups oi violin solos that were run
oi charni. In producing heautiiul
tone quality and delicate interpretative
ettects. This artist is a master. The
audience encored him enthusiastically
art/er each group, to which he respond
ed with “Humoresque” by Dvorak, and
an arrangement oi “To a Wild Rose"
by MacDowell,

liirs. Tewksbury appeared in two
groups. one German, the other Englis ,
Her voice has a beautiful quality, is
admirably controlled, and is well ens
ﬂowed with range and power, A very
attractive stage presence enables her
to use these attributes to advantage,
The soloist was heartily encor-ed.

The accompanists tor the evening
were Mrs. Pierce and Mrs. Kennedy;
the director oi the Oratorio society,
Pl'oi'essnr Pierce.

While the attendance was not as
large as might have been capccted, the
concert was very enthusiastically re»

or titty dollars in the siiaulding Public
Speaking contest Wetlncstla) evening.
Edgar A. Cupp received the second
prize or thirty dolla , and J. owen
liedmnn the third prize oi twenty dal-
lirrs,

The roltlesi was characterized by
very close competition and the high
quality oi the individual speeches. The
chairman, Ho L. D. Kcmnierer, Dre-
-ented the speako in the iollowing
order:

B. T. Monro, '11, spoke on “Patrick
Henry, the Agitator," lie succeeded
in getting inlo‘ the slill'itoi his selec-
tion and showed paritcular command
oi his voice on the clip: , s.

Edgar A. ciipp, '11, gave a's“election
entitled “Back to the People." Hlﬂ
manner was pleasing, his delivery pol-
ished, his gestures easy and e.pres-
sive, However, in perfecting his tech-
nique he has lost to some degree the
abilit,‘ to give his thought to the au-
thence.

Roscoe Aylplegate, ’10, spoke at “Wil-
liam \Vl'lberlal'ce.’ He spoke with a
thoughtiulness and consideration
which gave weight to his message. Hi:
gestures and movements were rather
uncertain, and he did not completely
"snit the action» to the word."

Noel .7, Breed, '12, told oi "The
Power oi Convicti n." He held his
audience Well, His voice was well
balanced and pleasing. He was some—
what lacking in enthusiasm, and his
gestures were not entirely spontone
ons.

Albert E. Stuelke, ‘10, presented
"The True ileaning oi Gettysburg."
The selection gave an opportunity for
power-rill dramatic interpretation, in-
deed, it might be said that its oratori.
cal quality was lost in the dramatic
interpretation given. ’

.l, Owen Redmon, '13, spoke on “In-
diiicience," He carried his audience
very sri ccssi'ully; and suited his bed-
lly lllnvements [0 his message to :1 re-
marltablc degree. in’ general his
voice was good, but wa inai-rcd at
times by it iILulty ellullcldtion.

llarold F, Sir-orig, '12, gave an origi-
nal oration entitled "An Educational
Cal oi the \\'lltl"‘ His drs ission oi
the relation oi outside activities to
turllt'llllml worli made a popular ap-
peal aird enablcd him to speak with an
intense conviction which was lacking
in tho dcclanratious. He was out
classed by some or the other speakers
on tetlinidnc, lint was ‘lllm'lor in et-
ieclivc spaking, that ., c ,irig his
audience and giving them his message.
We judges were: president John A.
alarduis, Coe College. Cedar 'Rapids;
Frol sor Paul 8. Pierce. State univen
sity, lowa City; Frotessor John F. Nel-
son, hiarsnalltoun; r. s. H. Crosby.
