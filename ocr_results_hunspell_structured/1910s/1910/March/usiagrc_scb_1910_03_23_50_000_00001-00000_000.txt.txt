The annual FleslimaanopiiuiiiUi‘O
dual on April 23, \\ ll open the track
season at home and some lively colnv
petition is assiiied my this initial

‘event in which tiie Don ii‘o ster cup is

at stake. At present the lirst year
men are a strong iavoi-lte and unless
the Sophs develop a few “dark
horses" during the coming month, the
Freshman team captained by Ken Hun-
ter should win the meet handily.

Sprinters seem to lie at a premluin
in both classes. However, in case
Beers runs for the SODIiS, the dashes
ought to be exceptionally tast races
as both he and Marshall, '13, have run
on winning relay teams at state meet.
Fleck and Hunter, both Freshmen, are
considered likely poiiit- -iuneis in this
department,

The Sophomores have it good bunch
of distance men and are ”ilolieti" in
take the i‘ sis in both the inidlie and
long distances. it is very lu‘Uiluble
that Dan-kins will rim the quarter and
ball [or lalz and these events are un-
questionably conceded to him, Young.
st. John. Bari tt, Kensinger and brun-
dage are all good men and should be
able to corral the majority or the
points for the Sophomores in the ills
tsnce events. Holly seeis to be the‘
most likely Freshman distance man.

The Freshmen will have things
pretty much tiieir own way in tiie
hurdles as neither Ki car or Bar is
eligible to compete with 1319. Cole.
'13. has the call on the high ' cits"
but will be tor ed to the limit by
Kensinger. Ken Hunter is lmlouiitr
edly the iastest man over the low
hurdles and should have no trouble in
taking that event altho Carney, the
only Sophomore aspirant, should give
him some keen competition.

The jumps are a (assault as neither
class has produced any andidates in
these events. Weed, n Fresllmiin, has
a good record in the high iniiili, and
will be opposed by alcifee anti l-laines
for the Soplis. Cole; '13, and Edwards,
'12, are the candidates tor the n *L
two positions in the pole vault altiio
neither of them hate had any evlenilrd
experience. The Freshmen should hr
a little the best in the broad jump
with Cole and Hunter. Daiiltins will
probably do the jumping tor the Sophs,

The weight men are
mediocre with the advantage on the
side of 1913. limiter aiid Fleck seem
to have the First two positions in the
shot put but the Sopl may even
things up in the hammer with Wilson
and McAipln. The discus throw is
about even as Hunter, '13, Fleck, '13,
and Gustaison. '12, all throw it about
90 feet.

The Freshmen seem to have a little
faster short relay team while in the
mile relay. the teams are about evenly
matched.

With good weather and a fast track
this meet will he in every way the
equal of any that have been held in
the past years.

A Tennis Mammy.

A few or the men interested in ten-
nis, met in the Y. M. C. A., Tuesday
attei-noon, to discuss plans (or the
Spring. Mr. Fisher's plan, as outlined
by Murray McMurl-ay, is to form a
tennis association with Drake and
Ames, conducted in the same manner
as the Triangular Debating League.

Miss Milly Andrews, Grinneil, '09,
Who is teaching in Hubbard, Iowa, is
spending her spring Vacation with

The ll'Oillen’ gymnasium exhibition
llelll last Saturday evening was voted
by the large anti enLllusiastic audience
present, mi a great success. From
the opening grand march to the ﬁnal
i'ormation or the Grinnell G, the exam-
ples- oi gymnastic work given Wern
another eloquent testimony to the
Successful and efficient instruction or
Miss Anderson. '

The entertainment was unusually ins
tercsting both from the nature or the
dliiiSV and exercises themselves, and
the skill with which they were he
fol-med. The opening number in which
the elitire two hundred and ﬁfty girls
appeared on the door at once, was re-
markable [or the uniformity of move-
ments and periection of order main-
tained in so large a body. The Aes-
thetic Bali Drill, which followed. given
by the sophomore class, was one of the
prettiest drills of the evening, the
graceiul rhythmic nosing or the girls
as they bounded the bail making it
most effective. . i

one oi the features of the evening
was the military marching of sixteen
Sophomores, whose skill and precision
in the formation of the various ﬁg-
ures could hardly be excelled by a
group of West Point cadets.

The Indian Club drill of the Juniors
anti Seniors was most pleasing for its
beauty and grace of movement, and
the agility of the six seniors on the
Swedish ladder was a very good exam-
ple of the use of the Ilea\y apparatus
in gymnastic woi- ,

The Freshmen's Swedish movements
and e. r ses with the wands and
hisppdans were especially good.

The Dutch loik dance of tlie Juniors
proved exteedingly popular with the
aiidieure, the effect ‘e costumes '0! the
perlormers and their difficult dancing
in the liooilen shoes, being much ap‘
ill'etlnierl.

The entertainment came to a ﬁtting
cliniav iii the ﬁnal march or all classes
around the gymnasium, as they sang
the college song and waved the red
and black pennants, the long line or
sills hnalh forming in an immense G.
where they gave three cheers for the
college and Miss Anderson. .

The proceeds from the exhibition
