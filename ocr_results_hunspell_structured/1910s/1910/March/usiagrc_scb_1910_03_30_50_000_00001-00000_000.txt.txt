The vespei seir ce Sunday was given
over to the singing oi Pi'olessoi‘

mist but inspiring address by Prot.
Boodin.

For the Easter Vesper Service, the
vesper clroi gsve the second part or
Pi-oiessor Scheve's oi-atorio, “The
Death and Resurrection oi Christ."
This orator-lo is the one which Proi.
Scheve will direct in Berlin this sum-
mer and was written more ior a do
votional act on the hartot Froi, Scheve
than her actual rendition in public.

The second part oi the oratorio deals
with the Resurrection at Christ and
has many heantiiul solos and choruses.
Tire organ and piano accompaniments
are beautiiul and add volume and
back, mud to parts that otherwise
might be less strong, or the chorus
worli that at “He Lives and Reigns,"
“Our Savior King," was perhaps the
most beautiiul and inspiring, while Mr.
Lyrnaii's solo, “I Know That My Re-
deemer Livcth," is without doubt the
best part oi the oratorio. Mr. Ly:

of the beautilul melodv The duet by

event brot a new idealism into the
world and ior the iirst centuries foi-
lowing this great event men were
driven to do great things by the iorco
or the idealism that dominated their
lives. There has been, however, a.
return to the old-Lime indiliereiicc, to
the hopelessness oi the pagan Easter
and what is needed today is a revival
oi the idealism oi the early- Christians,
which will bring into the world again
