Chicago Theological Seminary

Calls the Attention of the Christian Men of

Grinnell, Iowa
to the Minister-y as a Liieworlr

PRELIDENT TAFT, in an address at Ohio University Julie 3d, said:
"During the last gaucraiion a too small proportion of the strongest
young men seem to have been attrocted to the millistrs. l look,
however, for 2 reaction in this matter. We may wtll expect that
after the wild rush for wealth that has characterized previous ‘
generations shall cease, the opportunities the opportunities for great
usefulness offered the clergyman will furnish a tempation to the
of the young college men.”

REV. NEWELL DWIGHT HlLLlS, ill his sermon ill Plymouth Chllrchv
Brooklyn, Oct. 9th, said
“The Sign: of the times seem to indicate that twenty years from
now the professions of law, medicine, and journalism will be
crowded to excess, but that there will be 2t shortage of ministers.
The man who is than forty years of age will ﬁnd the pulpit a
throne of ullexampled inﬂuence. I believe that the ministry is the
great opportunity for young men of ability and culture; but the ill<
lelleclual demands are 30 heavy that only those that have great
physical resources and intellectual reserve should undertake the task.”

No student who is 2 mm of Christian purpose can aﬁord to ignore this
outlook.

CHICAGO SEMINARY is in vital touch with the Congrtgational churches
of the Middle West, and can furnish ﬁrst-hand information on this subject.
Correspondence willl High School and College Students is invited. Address
