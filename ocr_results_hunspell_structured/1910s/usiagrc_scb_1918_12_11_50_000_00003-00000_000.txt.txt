The British Empire today is in great
part a commonwealth uf tree, self-
soveruiug nations, bound together by
ties at sentiment unaided by any clah-
uiatc machinery or government. It
reaches its decisions through no tor»
mal body, no autocratic sovereign or
bureaucracy, but through the ncgutia-
tlcns uud conlercnces of High Conl-
niisslcuers and Prime Ministers. YeL
tl.ls loose organization under the lead-
ership of the United Kingdom has suc~
cccded in establishing the Fax Britan-
nica throughout one quarter ci the
world, in impressing its members with
a sense of just treatment, and in bind»
ing them to the Empire with ties of
luyalty mid infection which the shock
of this war has served only to
strengthen.

If one quarter can be so organized
for the establishment ct peace, free
dam, and justice, why not the whole?
or course the parallel does not hold at
all points, for the British Empire was
created by the conquests of a single
dominant race. But it is sufficiently
close to be not only an encouragement

lbut a model, and the accumulated po-

litical and legal experience or the Bri —
ish in building up this vast structure,
the greatest political achievement ct
mankind, cannot but be of immense
value. All that is needed is the de-
sire, and aiter the war the desire will
be present, dynamic in form and irre-
slsuhle lu proportions. The gigantic
character of the struggle has bruught
home to the race the horror, fully and
iniquity or war as they have never
been realized h'crore. Millions o: wo-
men are asking why they should have
to lose their loved ones; millions of
men will wonder why they shall go
through the rest or life maimed, weak-
ened and shattered. These grieis and
questions will constitute a soil on
