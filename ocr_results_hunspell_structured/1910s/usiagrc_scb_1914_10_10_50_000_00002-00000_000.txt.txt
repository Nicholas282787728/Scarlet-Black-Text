NUMBER 8

OUR REPUTATION.

The Drake-Grinncll game has
become famous for, one tlling,#
the fact that the Scarlet and Black
team has repeatedly lined up
against a stronger Blue and White
eleven and has repeatedly defeated
them by sheer determination and
spirit. And always when this has
been the case the routers have
been given credit for this ﬁghting
spirit in their representatives on

i the ﬁeld. Because of the interest
and following of the fans, the team
has been carried to victory. Grin-
nell motors have their opportunity
today; the team already has the
ﬁghting spirit of the whole Col-
lege, and the responsibility of
keeping their enthusiasm at its
highest pitch lies with the fans in
the Stadium. Grinell’s rooting has
always been a feature of the day
at Drake, and the Scarlet and
Black followers seldom have
trouble in out-rooting the Bull-
dogs. Let’s keep up that repute»
tion today; We can win both in the
ﬁeld and in the grandstand.» Thir-
teen points or more!

. START RIGHT!

1 From the minute the Scarlet and
Black clad men come on the ﬁeld
until the last Whistle blowsJ We
want to let those men know that
we are backing them to the end.
The ﬁrst few minutes will count
for a lot in raising their order
to the highest point. If We allow
the Bulldogs'to score ﬁrst, it will
be twice as hard to overcome the
handicap. A united spirit will
prevent their scoring ﬁrst or last.
Let‘s stick together. If we start
right we’ll end right

DELPIIIC OPINION.

“GI-ind Up Gi'lnliell.”
GrLuuell will worn to Des ilaincs
Saturday three hundred strong. prc.
pared to make n his ﬁght for the game.
even though they conccdc ihc chances
to be decidedly against lhelu. They
have always been noted for the high
quality or their school spirit. There
is no greater wny to‘show schooi spirit
than to support an athletic term repre-
senting your school. Leis not let Grin.
nell show us nnything when it comes
to pep. Be rtt the gnrnc Saturday. Sit
in the rooting section, and raise your
voice for old D. u. When we hazlr that
“Gl‘innell wn yell" let’s come hock
with a hig “Blue and White.” Help
the team give Gl'innell n licking that
she will never forget. Get the spirit.

“GRIND UP GRINNELL.”

—-Delpllle.

Ey comparative scores it would seem
that the Grinnell game would he a
wslkowoy (or the Bulldogs. who dc.
feated Leander Clark 194). while (lie
latter defeated the Scarlet and Black
last Sntui-dny by a score of 7.3. But
as is always the case. not too much
must be taken for granted. as Gl'lunell
even when she has a poor team, nlwnys
plays strong against Drake, and it is
said hy those who witnessed the Grin-
Dell-Leander elnrkc game that the lat
ter played ﬁfty per cent better game
against the Congregationalists thnn
s a B.

they did agalllst Drskc. Anyway. the
Bulldogs are preparing to battle fnl‘
what they get. and it they win from
Grinnell, it will be because they have
n heticr team. and no element of luck
will play any port. Coach Gr-iitith will
work his men just as hard ior Satur-
day’s game as ll be had only a moder-
ate chance or winning it, and as this
is the ﬁrst game which counts on the
coveted “D“, competition {or pluccs
will be keen. ~Dclphic.
