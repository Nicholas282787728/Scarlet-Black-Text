on Field.

"A man who will riot do in a game
what he is coacbcd to do in practice is
a quitter," said “Dad" Elliot alter tnkr
ing three parahles, the Prodigal Son,
Christ and the rich young ruler, and
the porcine oi the talents as a text, in
a straighttorward, square-shouldered
talk to the nieu oi Grinneil at the lion‘s
Gymnasium Monday evening.

“Tile student hody hates a quitter;
God hates it quitter, and, let 'Ine tell
you men, the higgegst duittcrs i have
ever met have heen in the spiritual
realm. l have seen men who never-
knew what it was to face a pitcher;
they couldn‘t hit, hut lay down and
quit in mutual struggle—and today
they are wrecks."

The College . tin and Drink.

"The ﬁrst type of nraii I need not
hantiumitlie man who knows what to
do hnt plays test and loose. Tell me
why college men will tool with liquor
when men looking at the lowest aini,
ph icai success, will not touch it?"

to man can attord to lie or steal
yet many lie and steal in college every
day by getting grades in class rooms
not deserved. The worth of a diploma
of an institution is the worth ot, a
graduate, and the student who takes
a‘dipionla he has not earned detractsl
train the worth oiiiis school.

“Any man who has studied the times
knows that a man is cutting oti his
eiticiency by the practice ot cigarette
smoking. When all the large corporar
tions and industrial magnates draw the
line on cigarette and tohacco users is
it not high time ior college men to
beware oi so treacherous a fee?

Four Classes “'lm Swear.

“‘There are inst ionr classes oi men
who suear. The ﬁrst type is the poor,
ignorant old wretch who only has two
words in his vocahniary and who
swears ior want oi more words when
he is excited. The second type is the
man who has. lie either swears to
emphasize a. lie or gets caught in a
lie and EWBEII'S to get out of it.

“The careless, wcnk,
creature who ﬁguratively wears a pia-
card on his iii-east ‘1 know better;
hlease pit me. i swear' makes up the
third class.

”The tour-tn type is the man “he
honestly, and genuinely calls down the
curse ot the Almighty, upou himseit

why college students swear?

Fear of A550 es. .

"Dad" Elliot's address to one of the

serious thought in the choice or liie
vocation.

In a clear, fn -reaching \oice, ilr.
Elliot roroed his message deep into
the hearts oi Ills hearers.” Any motive

surrender to and to work through your

is: ital going to hold, is not oing to be
big enough." _l -

To prove this he presented three
requisites tor the happy lite.

One should always have the right
quality or tile in relation to God and
iian. “It is what we are when We're
not tr. ing to he anything that shows
our character," the speaker empha-
slzetL “It is when you are not trying
to hale inﬂuence that you must have
intiucnce that is lilting up."

“Then take )our lite and your voear
tron and put them into the ﬁeld of
greatest need. You women who are
going to he teachers, tnc harden oi
pronl rests on you whether you take
that position where tliilty or torty
