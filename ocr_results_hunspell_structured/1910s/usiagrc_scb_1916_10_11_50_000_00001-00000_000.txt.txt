Daily lonan siiys Grimirll Is betting
Two To One on Outcome!
Think Iiiirrmi lliis “Dopeu
on Sc. let Team.

Iowa University seems to have the
idea that Grinncll expects a sure v
tory next Saturday. All word which
comes from that place indicates as
much,

This morning's issue of the Des
Iloines Register contains a lengthy
story, probably sent in by their Iowa
City correspondent, saying that Grin-
nell expects to easily defeat the Io-
wans in the coming contest, The story
does not indicate the grounds ior such
belier.

Story ill Dally Iowan.

Yesterday's issue of the Daily Iowan
has a similar story under the caption
“ ‘On to Iowa’ Is Battle Call of Next
Hawkeye Foe." The article, as print-
ed in the Iowan, follows:

"Grinnell will be terribly disappoints
ed next Saturday.

"VVhaL did the Crinnell crowds cheer
about last Saturday? Was it over the
game w h Simpson which they had in
hand'J—Nope—it ivas "On to Iowa."

“Grinncll is today betting two to
one that the scarlet and black ivill de—
feat Iowa.

‘trccl Sweepers Coming.

"Next Saturday morning a special
train from the Congregational town
and the Congregational school will
roll into Iowa City for the game. Even
the street sweepers are coming. The
only man to be lcft behind will be the
station agent for the M. (E: St. L.

“In the face of the impending inrar
sioii from the west Coach Jones put
his men through a loose sort or worlc
out yesterday morning. The backfield
and e‘nds wolked running signals and
learned some new plays which Jones
has devised for the entertainment of
the collegians over the “reel-(rend.
While the backfield and ends worked
signals and tackles, guards, and cans

scrimmage against the freshmen.

Grinnell has been chosen as the 11th
meeting place of the Iowa Association
of Economists and Sociologists, which
will be held the first week of October,
1917. Al. the meeting of the conference
at Iowa City last Friday and Saturday,
Ames, Iowa. and Dubllque College all
put up strong bids for the convention
of next year, but. Grihuell was the
choice of fully two-thirds of the rep-
i-esentatiies.

Professor iyckofl read a paper at

the first. meeting on “Teaching Eeon- '

omles l,” Public questions as well as
teaching problems were discussed dnre
ing the two days of the conference
A number of husiness‘men hnd social
workers as well as professors, are on-
rolled in the or anization.

llll'il Origillitlt-ll Last Mlll‘cll.

The idea or the association was I' st
discu ed by Professor Keister, of Co is
hell, and Professor Wl‘clioff M the
time of the Griiiiicll-Cornell debate
last spring. other schools were iiitciu
ested in the plan and eleven colleges,
including Cornell, Grinnell, Iowa,
dimes, Mot-ntllgstde, State Teachers,
Coc, Diakc, Dubuquc, Ellsworth, and
Penn, sent representatives to the first
confer-once at. Iowa City. The other
colleges or the state will probably be
represented at the next conlei-euee

Professor B one of the Univei ity
of Iowa is president of (he ul'gal‘lwar

president, and Professor Kelster of
Cornell is treasurer. The executive
committee is composed o[ Professors

ADIOS, and :lchiti-lck of State Teach—

Only One in United States.

This oigani ation is the only one of
its kind in the United States and it is
probable that it will play a leading
part in the economic and sociologiml
ivork or the state colleges and other
state associations ivhich are doing
work along these liiie. .

It is expected that probably five

Almost this mother went to Drake
last year and since the Iowa game has
become the big out of town contest on
this fall's schedule, it is thought that
many who would have gone to Des
