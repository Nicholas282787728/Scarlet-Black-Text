'Scientiﬁc Treatment of Problem of
Christianity Lends Force to

Attended.

The Y. it, c. A. campaign has heen
a success. Rev. 0. S. Davis, in his
-verious talks to the College men dur.
log the last few days, has proven his
capability to handle the situation in
Grinucll. '

iiir. Davis has shown all Gi-iiiiiell
students that he is a great man. All
ot his speeches were clear, iiill oi
meaning, oi noble thoughts and above
all they were spontaneous. Coming
[mm the inner character or .the man.
as they did. they revealed him as he
actually wasid model type oi' Chi-is
(ion. The iutlnence he exerted upon
students was one resulting in a deeper
religious spirit. The y l. member
ship has been gieatly increased and
strengthened, Thereby assuring a suc-
cchfill year m that organization.

Sundai- noon at Bible Study he cato
his iirst talk, using the biblical stori-
oi the lame man. lie spoke oi the
inability oi silver and gold to help
him, and the power oi Christ to help
him. The duty ot the church, accord-
ing to air. delS, was to living the
lame man and Ch) ~l together,

The Vespers address which he deliv-

ered was a strong one. His il me
was that religion as a vital experience
is an integral part or our personalit_
After showing that perfection oi our
personality is the object of our culture
he spoke at the rive worlds. natural.
mental, emotional, moral, and relig-
ious. He believes that the religious
world was the greatest oi all the tithe
evs since religion is the dominant mos
tive oi a well developed person, and
cannot be ignored without violating
the dictates or ones being.
' The rill. c. A talks on Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday nights were just
as strong as the one at Vespers. On
