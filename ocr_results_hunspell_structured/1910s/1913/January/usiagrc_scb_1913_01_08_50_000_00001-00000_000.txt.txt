Griiiuell basketball prospects re»
ccired a big boost this week with the
cmpleyiiieitt or M. L. Fisher, “303, as
basketball coach. Fisher captained the
championship team of 1907, and is still
known to Grinnell enthusiasts as one
oi the best basketball players that
ever donned the Scarlet and Black uni-
form. He introdiitcd into ariilneil has-
lietball a knowledge or team play aiitl
oi the ﬁner points or the game which
was largely instrumental in establish
ing our present high reputation in has
ketball circles.

Fisher has been engaged to Coach
the team during the next two weeks,
and with his intimatedincu'lellge 0!
the technicalities of the game, he
should he allle, in that time, to drill
into the men that knowledge of "team
work" which‘ is one at the most valu»
able assets of a basketball team.

The'team is in.lair shape tor the
nothing or the season. Serrral oi the
men stayed in Grinncu during vaca‘
lion and consequently received the
beneﬁts or a {ew days extra practical
which will doubtless prove oi great
value during the ear . part or the sen-
son. There are about eighteen candi
dates ior places on the team, including
several new men who are receiving
their ﬁrst taste or 'Varsily basketball.
it should be possible to choose a iair
good team item the abundance oi ma~

are no indications that the prod

oi the be. days of the trip. Arriving
there shortly beioro noon the bunch
was immediately taken by autos to
their homes ztntl then “Bola” Wallace
gave a sumptuous Christmas dinner
to a nilniber oi tellows. That nitemoon
the entire Club assembled at tho Wal-
lace homo tor the Christmas tree and
each member received a present. A ile-
iightful luncheon was then served and
the remainder of the alter-noon was
spent in singing.
