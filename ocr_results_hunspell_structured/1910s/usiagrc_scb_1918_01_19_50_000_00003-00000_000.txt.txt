MISS lﬂNN FINDS

A VALUABALE DIARY:

Discovers It While Burrowing
Around in Her Home
Town Library

Miss Eleanor Loni-i, of the history
department, made a rare historical
ﬁud last summer when she found in
hcr home»towu library a. Journal or
INS-9, entitled “Mr. John Sutherland,
his Dial-y."

As she tells the story, she was bui-
rowing around in the library of Lm
porte, Indiana, and accidentally found
this gem, which in spitc at its bad
grammar and misspelled Words, is of
value because it gives ﬁrst-hand testi
inony or early liistor al events, and
gives a clear, liiiinoious picture at the
rural lilc of the timc.

[slit-ll “'llig llnlly

Among other things, young John
Sutherland tells 0[ his visit to th
grout Whig rally at the battleﬁeld ot
Tippecanoe, just outside Lafayette.
Thousands of people from all the mid
dle ll'cst ﬂocked to this event. Presi
dent Harrison gave an address there.
The log cabins, the parades and the
innumerable i-eli s (7) picked up on
the ﬁeld, the diaiy describes in detail.

John Sutherland gives a humorous
picture of his home and school lifi‘,
Whenever he mentioned his sweet-
heart, Eliza, he wrote in shorthand,
but fortunately left a key with his di-
ary. The extremely 10' prices or
wheat and other necessities are start-
liug to a Dl‘esentrday reader.
