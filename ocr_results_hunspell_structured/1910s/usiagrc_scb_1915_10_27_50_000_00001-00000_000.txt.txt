“Remeiiilier last year!" has been the
thought all season in the minds oi
Gi-iunell rootc whenever Coe has
been mentioned, anti next Siltui'tldl the
two eleieiis meet on Ward Field iii
the game union is looked upon by
many dopesters as the most important
mix in the Coiri’ercnce series. Coo has
rushed through the present season with
a string of unhi- {on victories, haying
defeated Parsons, Iou a Wesleyan, Alone

tiieir opponents G, Monmouth heing

Eliy's men deicated the Toledoites
last Saturday hy a as to ti count. Re-
ports iroiii this game would seem to
indicate, however, that the work oi‘
the Crimson and Gold players was
hardly up to the standard, as they were
admittedly outplayed in the iii-st halt
hi; Nelson's stur-i aggregation, and
the iiiteirerent-e or the coe hacks was
the weakest slioivrr this season.

A recent dispatch appearing in die
Des Monies Register bearing a Cedar
Rapids date hue, states that the Geo
eicren is ieariui oi the game uitlr the
Scarlet anti Blaek. Coach Ehy has
given his )‘énl'lllig squad some of the
Giiuiiell plays which were unearthed
by the ooe scouts at the Uelort game,
and the treshmen hare heoir creating
harm in the varsity lineup, according
to the report. inasmuch as the Geo
scouts saw little lint straight iolmzir
(Ions and two attempts at 3 forward
pass irons the Griliuell category, it )S
no wonder that the rival cairip has
lieen accused at circulating “hedr'
i-ies.
