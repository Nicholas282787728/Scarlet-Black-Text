And Why Not?

Gi'iiiuell college iins nlwnys stood tor
the host in everything And so our
Men's Glee cluh, through its excellent
work in the years post, hits upheld
this standard and mndh us justly proud
ot it,

But some ol us have wondered. it
during the last row years, the Club
hnsn't shown a growing tendency to
hccome too potcrnhl in its nature—ii.
by self-election the Chili hasn’t come
lo ore ~empllnsize Congeniality und so-
oinhility and under-estimnte the true
talent nnd nhilitr ol candidates. Since
the chip is representing Grinnell Col-
lege, we tool that our college should
he represented as truly rind highly ns
possible. llis this been true the lust
two or three years?

It is ditticult lor anyone to ignore
personalities, especially in the judging
or studwts’ abilities by fellow stur
dents. For this reason, then. the club
could he held to at much higher stnntb
nrd, ii it could he arranged to have
a competent judge present for the try-
out—rt person llllacqllzlililed with the
cnndidntes themselves, and on
thority who could judge with nhi L)‘
the talents ol' the contestants

Fortunately, the positions on our
toothnll tenin do not hold over rrour
one your to the nest. It n mnn who
oncc made the lazuli. (outilllled to hold
his plate whether or not he was the
host nrniiohle mall. our tennis would
become veritable fal‘ces. The strength
or n ioathal team delinuds upon getting
the very best pos :hle man tor ere
plnoe. Why not use the same method
in selecting a Glee Club?

The Glee Club bears the name of the
College. and is thereforeisupposedly
43s ‘l'elil‘esenlzttive as an nthletio
team.

Have we not a right to demand that
the same just and np-to-date methods
employed in choosing an athletic team,
he used in selecting a Glee Club?
