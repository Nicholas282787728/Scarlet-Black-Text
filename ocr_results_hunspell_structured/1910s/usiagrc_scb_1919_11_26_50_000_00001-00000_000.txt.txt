Purple Comeback in the
Last Half Results in

Touchdown.

Playing before a home coming
crowd which ﬁlled the blcachers,
Grinnell‘ and Cornell played to a M
stalemate in the annual contest be-
tween the two schools on Ward ﬁeld
Saturday. After being decidedly out-
played in thc ﬁrst half, and with the
score 7.0 against them, the Mt. Vernon
aggregation staged a comeback in the
second half and pushed across for a
touchdown.

Thc Pioneers played a wonderful
offensive game in the ﬁrst half, de-
spite the fact that the muddy ﬁeld
prevented the use of anything except
straight football. End runs were few,
and no gains were made on forward
passes. In the second half Cornell’s
superior weight began to tell, and
they were able to break through the
light Pioneer line for sufficient gains
to enable them to score. Ninertemhs
of thc ground gained on both sides
was made through the line. The ap-
pearance of Gowans, who had been
out of the last few games with it
broken jaw, in the Cornell lineup at
the beginning of the second half made
a world of differcncc, he and Sander--
son working together like a machine.
Gcwans played with his jaw in a
cast. '

Pioneers on Offensive.

Tile Pioneers were on the offensive
throughout the ﬁrst half. The Grin—
nell line opened up big holes in thel
heavy Cornell wall, through which
the Scarlet backs made big gains.
On one occasion Marlilcy plunged
eighteen yards through the center of
the line, and on another went thru
for ﬁfteen yards.

At the beginning of the second per—
iod Macy intercepted a Purple for-
ward pass and dodged through the
Cornell team for thirty yards, carry-
ing the ball to the forty yard line.
From this point the Pioneers started
a march toward the Purple goal, with
Markley and Parker making big gains
through the line. Markley kicked out
of bounds on the twenty-yard line.
but Cornell lost the hall a few too—
ments later on a bad pass from center
@‘v-ing the ball to Grinnell on Cor»
hell’s fifteen-yard line. Markley and
Macy went through the line for a first
down, and after two smashes by Park—
er which took the oval to the three-
yard mark and Macy went through
center for a touchdown. Parker kick-

Hammer Players Will
Present Ibsen Dramas

For the ﬁrst time since 1903 Grin—
nell people are ofercd a chance to see
the master-pieces of the most noted
of modern dramatists, Henrik Ibsen.
on a local stage, with the presenta-
tion at the Colonial theatre on Dec. 9
And 10 of “The Doll's House,” “Hed-
da Gabler" and “The Master Builder,”
given by the Madame Borgny Hammer
compa‘ny.‘

These three plays are usually ac-
counted the best of lbsen’s works.
Radically different in plot structure,
acting and nature, they show three ex-
tre‘mely different phases of Ibsen's
versatile genius. “The Doll's House"
is the best known to American auc
diences, havinghad spectacular runs
in New York, Boston and Washlhg~
ton, and showing for more than fifteen
years in every theatre center of the
country. ,
Produced in 1390.

"Hedda Gablcr" was ﬁrst produced
in 1390. It was immediately popular
in Germany and Denmark, being pro—
duced with record runs in both coun—
tries. Within a few years it had
spread to all the countries of Europe,
running steadily for nve years in
Paris' thud London. Miss Elizabeth
Robins brought this play to America
in 1399. Later the Russian actress,

 

animcva, appeared in this play with
huge success in Boston and New
York. .

“Hedda anler” is called an “inter—
national play" on account of thc
adaptability of characters to any coun-
try and any time. Hedda Gabler as
a character might have been taken
from any one of a dozen races.

“mater Builder“ Light:

A startling change from the rather
heavy realism of “Hedda Ghbler” will
be offered Tuesday evening in the
mysterious ,musical lightness of “The
Master Builder.“ Critics have been
astonished at the ditference in these
two plays produced by the same mas-
ter. It has been said that “The Master
Builder” has only one characteristic
in common with "Hedda Gabler,” and
that is the success which it received.

After playing for years on the eel-l—
tinent it was introduced to America
in 1900 by a company featuring Wil-
liam Pascoe in the character of Sol-
bess, the master builder, and with
Florence Kahn playing the part of
Hilda.

Ibsen is one of two or three drama—
tists in the world whose versatility
and genius are universally popular,
and whose plays rank close to those

Prize Hen Survives
121 Days Inter-
red in Hay.

When is a funeral not a funeral?
‘W'hen the lost is found! A FontanelLe
farmer was haying last July, and ﬁlled
his barn. Shortly afterwards, he
missed the prize hen of his flock. Days
passed, and the missing bird did not
appear and she was ﬁnally given up
for lost. 1

A few days ago, the barn was clear— l
ed of all the hay, and the mangcrs
were put in order. Imagine the sur~
prise of our rural friend when he
discovered thc lost fowl, still alive,
in one of the latter! The hen had
been without water and food, save for
a few clover heads, for one hundred
and twentvone days. She was emaci-
ated, and almost dead, but now
promises to recover and resume her
normal life.

‘THE TRUTH’ DELIGHTS

An innovation in Gripenll dramatic

measure the success of this play. Tho
excellence of the acting can lw judged
by this—that the cast of nine char-
actcrs was able to bring out tbc del—
icate shades of the modern psycholo-
gicztlrprolilelll play and present them
cfcfctivelr to an audience composed
to a large extent of alumni.

the character of Becky Wardcr, pldyr
ed by Mary Loving; Toni Warder,
her husband, played by John Egan;
Mrs. Genevieve Crcspigny, played by
Jane Cook; and . stcphcn Roland,
played by Joseph Kelly,
usually considered to heavy for am-
ateur presentation. “The Truth" calls
for the suspension of high emotion
for a period covering more than half
the play. To carry the thought of
the play without attention being di-
rected to the acting itself, demands
extreme skill.

Supporting these four principal
characters, and playing the difficult
roles of receptive actors, who must

played by Maude Hutchius and Lin~

is true also of the three remaining
people of the cast, Jcnks, Bella and
Laura, played respectively by John
Kingman, Harriet Wadsworth and
Virginia Smith.

The play was delayed until an un»
usually late hour. This made the
audience restless and contributed to

some extent to the ragged action in'

This play will be presented by a
different cast Thanksgiving night.
