WEDNESDAY, only 9,1917.

ill business comuiuuioiuum to th:

\V‘JIEN THEY COBEIZ.
Next Friday. after an absence of
three years, the Iowa Conference meet
comes to Grinnoll again. It is with

no small amount of pleasure that we,

see it return, and there can he no
doubt but that all Grinncll will unite
to make it a big event.

On that day We will entertain the
other college athletes at the state. It
will give a. chance to show that Grin-
nell hospitality is true hospitality:
May the opportunity he accepted.

Already the business men have
‘5th11 that they want to do their part
by asking the College to change the
date from Saturday to Friday. The
request has been granted, so that all
Grinnell business houses will close
for at least part of Friday afternoon.

Neither will the College fail to do
everything it can to entertain the vis»
iting athletes and show other lowa
colleges that Griliriell hospitality is
sincere.

APPRECIATION.

From time to time thcre is some-
.thipg which Grinnell people seem to
appreciate more than most others do
—just because they are distinctively
Grinnelllans. Yet local people could
well pay till more attention to that
tors of appreciation.

Grinnell people could help to make
the world happier and better by doing
more of two thingsvliy appreciating
worthy things more keenly and by ex.
pressing that appreciation a little bit
more. The local community has re-
joiced, it we may borrow the word
from President Mai s vocabulary~
has rejoiced in the music which many
diligent workers presented during tho
recent May Festival.

A few days study of one at the arts
cannot help but create a. keener
aesthetic sense, a thing which this
prosaic world needs in larger pros
portion, Since it is a thing which

. cannot be measured in dollars and
cents, the least that we can do is to
appreciate it and show our apprecia-

tion.

Feeling that all or Griunell is
thankful tor the efforts which brought
a real contribution, we take the libs
city in these columns of cxprcssing
[he gratitude of Gllullell to those who
wore buck or the Fe al; to the
many husincss nieu, perlcctly organ-
lzcd, who made the Festival a finan-
cial possibility; to l>roicssor and iirs.
ti. L, Pierce and the Girls Glee Club
for their part; to thc inany upper-
clnss women who spent hours of seri-
ous ciidcai-or in practicing for one of
tlic best May pogcnnts Grinnell has
over soon; to Miss Clara J. Anderson
for her until-rug citorls in planning
and directing the Foghorn; and to
inoiiy othcrs who did much to add to
Gl'illncll‘s acstlictic and artistic sense.
We have apprcciatcd their work.
Thanks!
