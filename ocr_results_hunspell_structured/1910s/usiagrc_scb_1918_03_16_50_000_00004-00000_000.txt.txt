EVERY GIRL HAS
CHANCE TO EAT
AT MEN’S DORMS

The exchange idea. as it has been
worked out thl week by Mrs. L. M.
Traer, house director, is givrng every
girl tlle privilege of dilring at the
men’s dorms, and every mall' a like
opportunity at the Quadrangle.

Eighty girls and eighty men “swaps
ped" dinner plates Friday night, as
they will Saturday and Monday nights.
With the exchanges caused by the two
recent banquets in the girls' dining-
roorn, the process will be complete.

A stag table with a girl at the head,
a lone man at a girls table, and varis
added zest to the sport. Girls' mans
oils other freak combinations gave
added zest to the sport. Gil'ls’ ma -
hers were under ﬁre, as the men pl -
tended to take notes for future refer-
once.

If the experiment proves successful
and meets with appreciation, it may be
repeated, Mrs. Traer says. -
