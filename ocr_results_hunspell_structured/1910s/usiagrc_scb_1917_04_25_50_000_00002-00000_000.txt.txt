ARMY A513 FARM.
One announcement of unusual sig-

niﬁcance was made yesterday by the.

English committee headed by Mr. Bal-
four. It has‘been stated before by
~Americens themselves, but coming
from a government which is experic
enced in the war game that is now
being played, it is of greater import
stilil

The committee was asked what du—
ties America. might perform which
would be of the greatest benefit to
the Allies. In replying, the different
functions of American cooperation
were ranked in the order of their im-
portance. They were as follows:

1. Shipping.

2. Food products and supplies.

3. Money:

4. Army and naval aid,

This shows ﬁrst of all that America
can do more in supplying food than
in actual military aid, in the eyes of
Great Britain. shipping of supplies
to the Allies is also or greater impor-
tance to them, Evidently Great Brit-
ain does not think very much of
America’s 'ability to give military did
just at present.

The above statcincnt from the Enge
iish commission strongly bach- up
what President \Vilsnu said in his i-
‘ceilt appeal for men to "turn in hosts
to the farms," If the English com-
mission had its way, college men
should think more about going on a
farm than in Joming the army. Both
are important, howcver.

A large number of que, ions asked
by students make it necessary to say
a few Wei-(ls about The Scarlet and
Black tryouts now being held.

As part of those to be elected shuuld
be undercldssmeu, a Di'elerence for it
few of the places will be given to
Freshmen and Sophomores who try
out, More students in those classes
should lie urged to try out.

There i. , ill vitality of time to enter
the tryout. Three of the eight issues
have alrmuly been passed. Since so-
ciety items are required for ﬁve out
01' the eight issues, by starting next
Saturday and handing them in each
time until and including May 12, the
requirements in regard to those can
be satisfactorily completed.

One new feature of the tryouts is

Sallie time ago an article appear
ing in the Scarlet and Black boie the
heading “Faculty Puls Ban on Down
‘Town Dancing." A day or so later-
:Prcsidciit Maui. in a chapel talk made
in tlat denial or the statement, s 'ig
,“The faculty has put no ban on aii_
liking.” Then he went on to explain
ilhat there are no arbitrary rules in
primed, and that college students re
iold enough to know what to do with-
out a book of rules.

But a low days ago several scvei-al
lstlldcnts received notices for tho col—
liege office to the effect that they were
.depi-irctl of privileges for a period for
ititlellding a down town danc To be-
igin with, this is the ﬁrst time that
most of us were aiiai-e that the priv-
ilege of enjoying the company of a
‘youug lady was contcrrcd upon us by
Kthc Griuncll laculty or the student
;Culincil or any other local authority.
iIn fact many of us had exercised that
right before we inteodcd coming to
Grlnuclll Also, the dance which these
men attended was during the Spring
vacation, Dances always have been
held at this time, and no objection has
'evcr before been offered by the fac-
lull, President Main distinctly said
“We have taken nothing away—no
have simply adopted a plan augg ted
by the Student council, we have given
you a silver dollar in place of a dime."
I Then if nothing is taken away why
,can we not still dance in vacation ii
, we wish? president ilain himself has
said that vacation dances have long
been iccognizcd.

If the faculty. or the administration,
or the faculty social committee wishes
to pass arbitrary rules, or to take or-
bitrary action, even with the sanction
of a Student Council bound by a
promise, why must the president deny
that such a rule exists. and above all,
how can they heat the average col-
lege student to think that no arbitra v
rules t when he finds that p
leges \\ ich seem more like rights,
are taken away from him because he
has broken a rule which President
Main declares does not exist?

A Junior.

We, as students. are proud of Grin-
ncll because the demotr ideal of
our college has been advanced innch
farther than in any other institution
of its kind.

However, a recent action on the
part of ”a. power behind the throne”
has brought about a new situation.
Our good friend democracy has been
overthrown for a fcw wee and in its
stead we find some unknown :tutue
ci-ats who seemingly have allowcd
their personal opinions to mitt in with
the matter of re on dance

Our dilhculty 5 tin Pr
have been taltcn away ft m a group
of students for attending a dancc
April 3rd. But the rule uuder which
they were punished was not passcil
until AFTER the dance had occurred.
This ruling was thereroi-e imposed
EX POST FAC'lG. it is inconsistent
with our ideal of democracy and rio-
lates every principle of insticc for
which we had hoped, in our student
government.

. We believe in the proper cniorc
ing of roles where they apply, but
we condemn any attempt to impose

tax post facto rules,
