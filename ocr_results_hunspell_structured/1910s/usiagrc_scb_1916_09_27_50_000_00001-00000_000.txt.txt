After battling all night, the Fresh-
men won an undisputed class scrap
victor; on Word Field at nineteen
ininiitcs alter six Tuesday morniig
By means of automobiles used ior
rapid transportation or nicn, a record
was established (or the greatest niitn7
bers of captives taken in a single cone
test. When the whistle blew tor the
morning struggle to begin, only twerr
ty-thrce Sophomores were available
and the battle soon ended.

Indications that a class scrap was
soon to take place began to appear as
ear ~ as 7:30 Monday evening, ivlreri
the Sophomores locked up about tweu
ty»{ivo Freshmen in the amphitheater-
on Word Field. Through the promo
tion of Juniors, these and other men
were released.

At nine, the Freshmen met and or-
ganized at the Men's gym, while the
Sophs were plotting on Ward tield.
By ten, over one hundred and titty
first year men were marching to their-
camp at the tairgrounds. Fir-es were

built and scouting parties were soon
sent out.

The iirst Soph to be captured was
Kellchcr, and using him as a decoy,
the Freshmen succccded

getting

Stock, McGlotlilin, and Schwartz be-

lore reaching their camp. Freshman

Brown of this scouting par was tale

err by the Sophs. Mai-klcy was trailed
, and atter rrraking a plunge through a
Sophomore gang, tound satcty under a
grape vine. He reportseheariog runny
Sophs near bun, and two hours later
was able to find the Freshman camp.
”Tug" Miller and Emma were the next
victims oi the Freshmen.

The f st Freshman taken was tee
earthy, who ivas locked up amt tied
hand and loot in a bed. l/‘Osemllg
himseli, he knocked a scrcen oil,
jumped to the ground and made a trip
to tire tau-grounds.

At about 11:30 the first real i \
took place near the Preston House.
The Freshmen ‘elc ‘tIULOl‘S at li--t.
but rciniorcemcnts ot' cpl ,llr’t'!‘£‘d~
ed in capturing ventccn rues who
were tied and locked up under the (ink
pbitheater. This striigglc was hard
fought and lasted nearly an hour, it
was witnessed by iriairy neighbors and
Preston House men.

The Freshmen nevi lot-med a “Speedy
Six" scouting party, tilrose lit-st duty
was» to get Fraser from a irain. There
they encoiintci-ed equal niinrb s ol
Sophs and perhaps the hardest taught
battle took place at once. nu oncom-
ing passenger train slowed down her
cause at the lighting iiot tar from
the tracks, on additional squad or
yearlings was sent tor, which resulted
in the capture ot “Smoke" Brown,
Bracy, Turner, and Johnson, Frascr
was inrablc to get oil the train, and
consequently spent the morning in
Marshalltown.

The no t clash to take piacc appear—
ed on t-arioi par of the campus
about two o'clock in the morning, Thc
» Sophs, though oiitiiiiiubercd, put up a

fierce scrap and both srdcs gi‘uncd
captives. The Freshman spoils oi this
action consisted of B10" r, Al‘mlulls~
ter, Bo\\‘cl., Focht, Birchard, and Ag-
new.

Altogether at this time the sonhoe
mores had thirty captives and the
‘speedy Six” of the Freshman brigade
was sent out to see what could be
done towards releasing the Freshmen.

E. '1‘. Meredith, democratic candidate
for governor, spoke for half an hour
at chapel yesterday morning on "our
Duty as Citizens and the Building of
a Bigger Iowa."

In fulfilling the duties of citizenship
and in the building or a greater state
Mr Meredith emphasized the [act that
.7. real present (lay patriotism which
is willing to work at vital tasks be—
fore, it, is necessary, and not a pair t-
isni that glories only in the past,

“In the building of a bigger state,
what are some of the things we can
do?" asked the speaker. "One of our
duties as ClLlZOHS is to cast our vote
at the elections. There are counties
in Iowa where less than ollcshalf oi
the men have exercised the siili‘ragc.
llldiffelencc of i'otcl‘s is one of the
great eiils in this state.”

Speaking on the (ill on ot woman
suitrage in this connection Mr. Mei-
dith said: “I feel that if the women
had hecii given the vote they would
have been on the job voting. Now
that the their have decided that women
shall not \ofe there is all added re-
sponsihility on them,"

“One OI‘LhC things that I w each
one here might study and become beiv
tcr acquainted with," said the speak-
tcr, “is the study oi zt‘ 'lcullule in tho
lptihlic , lioots It we are to have a
1permanent ag iilliirc in Iowa tlicn

Uilllc interest in agriciiltiiic is

"Oilc nt‘ the is res in this state is

they cannot enjoy the advantages or

such iiiipoitancc to this state."

Taking up the liquor question, one

ent campaign [or the governor rip,

After a week oi bard scrimmage
against the treaty F nuan stirred
Ceacb McAlllloll has rounded the va
til) strand ill’) good shape, pl‘epal'as
teiy to Gl'lllllcll'i; ii -t game against
Ltandcr Clark iicvt Saturday atteiu
noon. - _

The new men have been put through
especially dillicult dr .ig so that they -
might be in the best or condition this
coming Saturday The coach will
probably use every man on the squad
against Leander Clark, it it is possible.
The exact strength of Leander Clark
is an unknown quantity, as the school
has kept everything concerning its
tootball tcain secrot. According to the
heir Conicrence rules trcshmen are
eligible to play w’ h Leander Clark
against Grinnell. Crinneli is permit-
tcd also to use trcslrmcn, but will not
rise the privilegc.

From what meogc reports that have
becn obtainable, it is evident that L94
auder- Clark has no more than thir-
teen upperclassmea on the Squad. It
is very probable that a good portion
of the team will licsbnicn. But
even only a low men can make stitt
oppo. tion, because three years ago
Leander Clark dcicatcd Gl'ihucli when
there were but twelve men on their
squad. However, it nos o to
even estimate the strength of Leander
Clark, because they bat e been keeping
tiiiiet concerning their iootball pros-
pects. AL airy rate Grimiell is fully
prepared to meet the best opposition
that mi tit come, and the harder the
opposition the better is the experience
tor Gl‘illllell's team.

The probable tenrn that will line up
against Leander Clark Saturday con-
sists oi scren veterans lioin last year‘s
team. MCAllllml h \illipped his
squad into a condition which was not
