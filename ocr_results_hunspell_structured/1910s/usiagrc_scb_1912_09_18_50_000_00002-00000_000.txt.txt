THAT MONEY HUNT.

The one thing necessary f0)“

Grinnell‘s growth is the successful
accomplishment of the present enr
dourment campaign. The students
in the campaign of a half-dozen
years ago gave material aid by
numerous personal gifts, but in the
present ”hunt” they may do an
equal service to the College and
the students yet to come by bring-
ing the ﬁnancial committee in
touch with those who could give.
All over the state there are ueople
who would be glad to leave their
money to a college like Grinnell in
return for an annuity during the
rest of their lives; there are others
who could easily join the Century
Club and others who would give
smaller amounts. Make it a point
to tell President Main or Mr. Jaqua
about them and contribute ‘thus to
the success of Crinncll.

NO PROSPECTS!

Not a single name of a pi‘ospecr
ve student has been dropped in
