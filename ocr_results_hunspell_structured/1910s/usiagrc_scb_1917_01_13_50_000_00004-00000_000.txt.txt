LARGE AUDIENGE ENUUYS
STRING QUARTET MUSIU

Crowd Nearly Fills Chapel .it Last
Appearance Thi i' 73118. Sun.
lcy will Depart Soon
For iiarrnrd.

The last public appearance at thc
Gl'lniiell College String Quartet here
this year, at least with the present
personnel, was witnessed by an audi-
cncc that nearly filled llc le chapel
last night.

With Mrs. Bertha Shutts Smiley, v
ola, leaving for Harvard with Mr. sine
icy at the beginning of the second se-
lliestc‘l', it was deemed neccsSary to
have this recital last night. The tips
preciative mood of the audience would
indicate that more such would meet
with popular favor in Gi'lilnell, and
that Mrs. Smiley's departure will he
regretted in local inusicai circles.

, Violins .ii-o Best.

The program last night showed that
thc Quartet is playing up to its former
standard, possibly a little better. which
has mail-lied it as one o[ the leading
musical organizations in the College.
It would he difficult to state which
of the artists surpassed in rendition.
though the Helms probably harmonic
ed more perfectly togcther than the
other instruments '

Ave Miiriil Is Fin'oi'Iie.
Particularly was Mr. Peck‘s solo
work in Ave Maria to be praised, This
was undoubtcdiy the iavoritc on the
whole program, probably made so by
the perfect pitch and ich tonal quali-
ties in his playing. Miss Sear-y made
a. perfect second ioiinist, and pirt a
spirit and expression into her playing I
which made it a pleasure to listen to
her.

Negro Melodies Are Old.
Unusual interest was attached to the
last number, Dvol'all‘s Quartet. This
consisted of four movements made up
almost! entirely of negro melodies.
The last movement, with its i-ythinicail
swing and "catching" harmony, was
another favorite number.

Much credit must. lie given each of
the musicians for their efforts. The
String Quartet this year includes:
David E. Peck, violin; Grace Scary.
violin; Bertha Shutts Smiley, viola;

j George L. pierce, yrolonceiio.
