The presentation of "The Mob" by
the Forum and Flu Dclpli societies
last night proved a creditable Del‘folntv
aiicc of an unusually ditiiciilt play.
The heavy tragedy of the theme and
the series or tense emotional situa-

, tions made the drama one or the most

difficult evcr
Iians.

The deputation scene in the second
act and the dream episode in the third
act were probably the most skilliully
,actcd portions 01' the play. Bernice
larvadlcy, as l-Ielen, scored a decided
{success in the latter, when She vivid
,ly described her dream ol the dumb or

,ot clevcrly drawn characters anti rrci-o

play, be displayed an ease and cori-

\Is the university or the college a
‘maLCh-lnaking institution? Do stu-
'dents come to college tor the purpose
cl hunting mates?

| The old Question, which has always
seemed to bob up periodically has been
raised again. This time the agitation
:was begun by Dr, Florence Sheborn,
who has been connected with the State
University at Iowa City tor about a‘
year. and whose comments upon tlrc‘
qucs ion were printed recently in a,
Dcs iloincs paper,

“llll1il'rs=ctl ll; Hitting.”

Dr. Slicrborn was quoted as s viiig:
“\l'hcll I went to the university I was
impressed by the serious business ci‘
mating which goes on down there. The
girls and boys may think about other
things part of the time, and some oft
them do not seek each others Com-‘
parry, of course, but spcnking or tlle‘
vast marority, the young people aret
hunting their mates in the world; tliat,’
is their primary occupation."

The statement ot Dr. Sher-hon quot-,_
cd above at once aroused a~storni oiy
protest from Iowa students, The was,
men's league of the university issried,‘
a statement to the ciiect that on the
part of the women at lettst, the busi:
nc ot iiratc limiting was not hrst in
their thoughts.

Not True in GrillllPll, s“

In an chart to get the Gliltnell ctr
titudc rrpon the qucstron a rrurnlici oi
administration and [acuity members;
were asked as to their vicr ii regard
to the incident. In the opinion of the,
Del-soils questioncrl the idea that a co-
cducational institution can be regard»
ed as a manulaclory of marriages is
air erroneous one.

I One administration member said that

 

‘ anyone who has been connected with

‘collcgc or‘ irniver v work {or any
length of limo will hardly look at the
question with the viewpoint that Dr.
Slrcrhoii is quoted as expressing. It is
natural and proper- that the students
find mates in college, according to this
member, but that they come with the
primary purpose of looking tor mates
