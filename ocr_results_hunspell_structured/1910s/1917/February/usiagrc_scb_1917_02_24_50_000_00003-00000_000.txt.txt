ANOTHER SCARLE" ITEVER
CASE APPEARS AT JOX S'

A mixrup has ariseir in the late
scarlet fever development. it has
turned out that Crott has not httd'the
disease at all, contrary to the first l'ee
ports, hut Rumble has lrad it and is
doing very nicely, A controversy has
arisen as to whether Stout is atilietcil
or not, He ieels all right, and Doctors
Clint Harris and J. 'r. Badgham, two
leading physicians of the city. declare
that he has not been infected with the
disease. not Dr. E. E. Harris, who is
city health officer and therefore has
the say as to ouarantines, has decreed
that a card he placed on the house
from where it was removed hut two
days ago, when Rumble was taken to
the detention hospital in the southern
part of town. it is probable that Stout
will he taken there soon, and on ac—
count of the uncertainty he will be
kept in a different part of the house
from Runi‘ole until it is sure that he
has or has riot scarlet fever.

President Main and Professor Ropes
were among the guests' entertained by
the Quadrangle girls when they held
an "open house” for the faculty, vi,
ors, and men of the college during the
afternoon of Washington's Birthday.

As the afternoon passed in pleasant
conversation and in making of new so-
quaintances, the guests slowly drifted
down to one or the other of the cot»
tages where, in the pleasant living
rooms, they gathered ahout fire-places
or listened to entertainment in the
form of humorous readings, instru-
inentai selections, and vietrola music.
A feature of the program in Cottage
III was the presentation of several
records by Miss Holder. At the close
of the after-neon fr-appe was served in
the big central corridor.

A norel, distinctive an artistic Cm-

Tile literary eflorts in it are so good
that all are worthy of being called

The sto . on the Glacier National

tcrostirig, made more so by several
photographs the writer has taken. One
of the gems of the rrunihcr rs the poem
entitled "The Cardinal," hy Grace
Hunter, showing as it does a beautiful
interpretation of a hit at natural life.
Miss Sheldon's character studY is “he
usually scholarly and instructhe, and
Miss Drott's “College" is a truly Grill»
neliian effort. other features are
poems by Frank Thone, Norman Hall,
liar-old Van Dol'n, Edith Tulilc, Yutas
lia hiinakutehi, and Ben Schwartz.
Short stories by “Rusty" and “Anonyu
luous" are included,

\Vhile recent numhers of the Grin-

being poorly edited, this issue is a tics
cided improvement in that line and the
editors should be coiuprimented for
their efforts. While the rush oi a
ofiiee cannot help but
hrccd a tew typographical errors, it
is different with a magazine which has

‘ plenty of time for editing. Such errors

are hardly excusable there.

AT GHAPEL WEDNESDAY

'rlrin-sility.

Mr. D. Brewer Eddy, the secretary
or the American Board ol Commission-
ers of Foreign ll sions and a gradu—
ate or Yale University, will speak in
chapel next Wednesday morning on
some phase of the Gl‘iiluellriu»Chiua
movement. He will address the stur
dent body and citizens of Grinnell
again on Thursday, in observance of
the annual Gl‘lnnell-lquhiua day. The
servrces Thursday will he similar to
those held last March at the same oce
casion.

illr. Eddy's last appearance in Grime
hell was at a chapel service shortly
helore commencement last spring,
when he pictured very vivrdly the Ar-
menian massacres, showing the ex-
treme cruelty of the Turks, The only
other time he has been heard by a
Grrnneil audience was three years ago
this spring, when he spoke in connecs
tion with Gr unelHu-Chind day.

hctor-c the gun sounded. HIS guarding
was superb and Berrien never had a
legitimate chance to score. After mi
rug his ﬁrst toul he threw seven
straight. Thirteen of the locals' [il-
teen points are credited Lu the Grin-
rieil captain. Norris put all his energy
into a determined guarding effort and
was especially effective in getting the
ball under the Griunell basket. Mea-
cliarit played in hard luck. He got his
shots oil in spite of Sclirli’s smother
mg and ceaseless guarding, The won-
der oi it is‘ that he got them off at all.
With airy ordinary amount of good for
tune he would have scored two or
three. He fought hard all through the
contest and was game to the finish
Augustine did not push the game with
his customary aggressiveness This
was perhaps due to the fact that he
played a cautious guarding game.
Bagge covered a good deal of the court,
playing a good ﬂoor game. his long
distance attempts were truly aimed,
but usually fell short. Hrs passing,
however lelt much to be desired. Sea»
soning will doubtless eliminate this
error. With Somers‘ advent into the
game, stock rose temporarily for Grin»
nell. He was after the ball and down
the field for shots, annexing one pret—
ty gut-11.

it was a thrilling battle—a good
game to watch, but a hard one to lose.
0n pure merit, however, the victors
deserved the spoils as Grinnell was
never ahead during thegame. The oL
ficiatirig of Hoffman and Hedges was
satisfactory to players and crowd.
