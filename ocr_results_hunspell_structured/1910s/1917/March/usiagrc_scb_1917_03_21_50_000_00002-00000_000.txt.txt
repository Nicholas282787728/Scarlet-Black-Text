0x13 THAT’S DerEEEh‘T.

About the most original and most
interesting kind of military training
to be worked out is lieing formulated
at the University or Oregon.

There are innumerable kinds of mil-
itary training but what Oregon is plan-
ning is different. It is a class in mi
itary tactics. unusual liccause ol its
originality.

The class is being organized under
the direction or Dr. warren D. SiniLh
of the department of geology in the
University. The plan is to train men
to he alile to worl: into the government
engineering corps. N0 drill is re-
quired. hot a discussion of the plant—
ing of explosives wtll be given. A
study of the geological formations ol
the coast and particularly the value
of rock tor-maticns for fortifications
will he studied. Preliminary practice
in map-making and maprl'eading will
he included. The class will take Week
end hilres and intend to camp. out in
regular military fashion while pursu~
ing their studies.

The particular feature or the oregon
plan is that it is fitted to Oregon. It
is original. It is planned in such a
way as to make the best of what Ores
gon already has. A geologist is a-
veritable, so that subject is used as a
basis for a course. He also has had
some experience in the Phillipines
during the Sp'anislerlnerican war as
a mincrological expert. This exper-
ience is used, too, and so the course
is to he one in military tactics with
emphasis on engineering. It’s simple
enough.

Another good point ahout the ore-
gou plan is that it is entirely volunt-
aiy. Compulsory education may be
all right under certain circumstances;
lint it it can he made voluntary it is
all the hotter, liecause then only can
the most cnthusiasm tor study he re-
alized.

Any new plan must have these tivo
qualities for its greatest success. it
can lack one or lioth oi them and still
succeed but its iesults wrll not he as
great.‘ The best plan should he vol-
untary and fitted to suit its surround-
ing circumstances.

Knox college is the latest. school to
adopt military training. At a recent
meeting or the Board of Trustees it
was voted to apply to the United
states government for an officer to

cured. the captain of the Galesbln'g
