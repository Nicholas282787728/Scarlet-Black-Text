LIKES PAPER.

April 23, 191751301” Sir I
am enclosing in this letter a
check iur 00 to pay for my
subscription to the S and D.
for this year. My slowness in
paying my subscription does
not indicate my appreciation or
your paper, for I think it has
noon the best paper ever edited
since I have hcen acquainted
with it. The unusual quality
in it which has made it of ine
tel-est to “old grads" is the
fact that you have kept out
personal notes and have given
. ur attention to telling of
vital affairs to the school.
