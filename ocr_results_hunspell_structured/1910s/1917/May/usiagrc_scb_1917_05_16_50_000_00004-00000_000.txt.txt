DISCUSS BREAKING
ATHLETIC RELATIBNS

Iowu Conference Representatives Con-
sider Discontinuance of Belu-
tions Beginning Next Sen.
temller—to Decli‘le
Litter.

Whether or not~to continue inter-
collegiate athletic relations at the be-
ginning ar the next college year was
the question hetore the faculty rep-
resentatives oi the Iowa Conference
who met here last Friday rollcwins
the ccnierence meet.

This problem is to be solved at the

beginning 01 the full term by a sDe-,

Cial session ot that body which is to
follow a consideration or the matter
by the faculties or the ten diderent
institutions. In the opinion of Fri-
day's conrerence, the question c‘ould
not be satisiactorily settled at the
present

At this session some minor changes
were made in the Iowa intercollegiate
athletic rules. Section ten, which l-es'
quiles the candidate for a team to sub
scribe to a statement or his eligibility,
was dropped This simply means the
formal repeal of a law which has tor
some time been discontinued in prac~
tics. The tact that a faculty com-
mittee must determine the eligibility
of end; player, lenders such a ruling
superﬂuous.

The vote or the conrerence in No-
vembeI', 1912, that all institutions
with which conrerence colleges should
compete, must observe conterence
rules ur‘their equivalent, was changed
to read-
equivalent or the rules of the conier-;
ence to which they belong " The pur-
pose or this change was to permit the
smaller colleges or the conrerence to
enter competition with
having less stringent rules.

When deposited on the lawn in from

have been expressed as to his feelings
on awakening, and ms appearance,
when in ﬂowing robes he traveled the
hundred yards or so between his bed
and his abode.

The men, who were prompt and
punctual to the dot, created no un—
lusual stir when they were round
seated without an accustomed hostess,
at one oi the Quadrangle tables. The
girls, however, who had waited to wit-
Iness the errect o: the men’s entrance,
appeared at the club rather late. A
sudden scraping uf chairs greeted
