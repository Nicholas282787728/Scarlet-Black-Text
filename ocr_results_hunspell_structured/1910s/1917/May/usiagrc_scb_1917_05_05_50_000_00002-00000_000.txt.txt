It has become the custom once a.
year (01 the Scarlet and Blaclx inan-
ngcnient to turn one issue ovei to the
gills of the staff to be devoted to
those interests which especially Conr
cern the women oi the school. This
dai', 111 so many Ways a. gil’ls' day,
with its May Pageant in the afternoon
and Glee Club Concert in the evening,
seems a. fitting (lzty [or the publicah
tion of the third annual Woman’s Edie
ticn,

All persons t g for positions on
The Scarlet and Black are requested
to see the Edito -ianhief at once for
their special assignments.

“'11): 2 ‘D WHY NOT?

To college girls all over the land
has come the challenge to sacriﬁce
unnecessary little crtrnvagdnces and
still more unnecessary \vastefulness.
The tollowing bits of conveisation are
quoted from an editorial entitled “Lit-
tle Glains of Stand” In the Vassar Mis-
cellany News of recent date:

“Yes, everything pleaseil really
don't want anything but potatoes and
gravy. but its so much easier to say
'cverything.’ What did I take that
bread for? I couldn't possibly eat it.
But what's one slice of bread?”

“That’s a darling dance dress, but
I can't possibly buy it now. Yin econ-
omizinggtlie war, you know7Cnme
on, let's have some food. “All right.
I’m not really hungry but I, could eat
some ice cream and a fruit lemonade
maybe.”

The writer comments by saying to
leave the dance dress on the hanger
by all means, but asks "why not also
sacriﬁce this purely ‘non-scadcniic’
rood?" Why not. indeed?

VACATIO." SERVICE.

The average college girl is accuSr
turned to spending an idle nnd'leis-
urely vacation. At this time when
everyone is anxious to do his or her
hit, she can readily contribute her
summer months.‘ Many positions
which will be left vacant liy men can
undoubtedly be ﬁlled by women. In
Canada the Class at women corre-
sponding to those in our colleges buve
round places in banks, munition fac-
tories and in various industries. In
relief and social service work they
are proving themselves invaluable.
In our country a woman, \Irs. Carrie
Chapman Catt, lids been given a place
on the Council for National Defense.
she heads a department to organize
the services or women workers. The
patriotic college girl can surely do no
less than volunteer licr spare time.

The women of Gi-innell proved that
tliev are interested in wireless tclc-
gr ihy when, at the meeting of the
wilclcss class this morning their zep-
iesentation was as large as that or
the men.

This is not only true of Griiinell,
but the large girls‘ schools of the
East, such as Wellesley, Smith and
Vassar, which are, in this present
crisis, circling the choice or either
ﬁrst aid, nursing, steliography or
wireless, with the latter as the lava
ite. In fact a new war time dctivuy
seems to have been opened to the
women of the country.
