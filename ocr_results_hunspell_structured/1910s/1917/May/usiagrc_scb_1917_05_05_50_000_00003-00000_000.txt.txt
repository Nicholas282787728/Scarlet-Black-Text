LUHNA PALMER IN HEGITAL e

Presents Diiiicult Program—Liszt
Concerto llllll Beethoven Soiictu
Brilliantly Played.

The major if no recital by Lorna

‘ Palmer. ’17, Friday evening. was per—

haps the most dilncult and technical
program ever given by a Senior. Miss
Palmer's ability to play both the briir
liant and melodic parts with equal
sympathy was a feature of the recital.

In the Concerto No. 1 in E hat, by
Liszt, Miss Palmer was accompanied
exceptionally well hy the College or-
chestra. The tour movements in pi~ac~
tically usual form. were played with
little break between them. In thg
trill work and hrilliancy of the cone
certo especially. Miss Palmer dis-
played her excellence and preciseness
of technique.

The Beethoven Sonota was inter-est-
ing heeause it “strikingly diiiers from

all earlier ones in spirit and style.”

says a critic. "Only a player who has
advanced rhythmic precision to rhyth»
mic freedom can interpret this So-
nota." To all those who heard Miss
Palmer's recital it was evident that
she was capable of handling this num-
her.

"Sunset,” by PI‘DL Schcve, was a
general favorite. The impressionistic
study was given a most charming in-
terpretation.

The typical Brahms selection, a
Scherzo in E ﬂat minor, was the heav-
iest and most dimcult numher. The
variety of moods, which characterizes
Miss Palmer's playing, was again ap-
parent here.

“The Dow is Sparkling," by Rubinr
steianendel, in somewhat lighter
vein, was made unusually pleasing.
Miss palmer played the Chopin Etude
and the Romance hy Tchaikovsky with
an artistic ﬁnislt which displayed her
excellent training.
