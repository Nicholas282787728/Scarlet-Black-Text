CONGRATULATIONS!

The accompanying cartoon by
Ralph Douglass in the Monmouth
College Oracle so vividly presents
the nttiturlc we should all take in
regard to the man selected for mills
tary‘ service, that the scarlet and
Black asked The Oracle for permis-
sion to reprint the cartoon. This-
was readily granted, and we thank
,the editor,
the cartoonist, Ralph Douglass, for
their co-uperatiou.
