THE 0I"NING GAME

Crrimiell welcomes the iisitors troin
Davenport who are today to open the
local gridiron season. one of the
strongest schools in tlie Hawkeye con-
fel'ellcc, st. Ambrose ts a desirable

season opponent.

W ile today's game is unimportant
[ruin a conference and “Big Four"
standpoint, it will give Grinnell tans
an opportunity to get a line on the
team which will go up against Iowa
after two more weeks of practice. The
St, Ambrose game will also furnish
“dope" on conference possibilities, as
the Davenport eleven held Coe to at
11H] score last Saturda ‘

A low score today is expected, hilt
the strength as well as the weakness
or the Scarlet and black eleven wtl‘
be partially uncovered.

The tootliall schedule in . been the
oasis of considerable consi ent and
inconsistent criticism so far this fall.
But with the securing at two early
season games on the home lot, and the
possibility or at least one other goodi
home game being added. the grid card
compares taiorably with that or other
years. War conditions and the dis
ruptioii ot athletics at other colleges

have been the chief causes of the
schedule ’trouhles.

One important home game is set;
tied, the clash with Coe oii Octoher
27, and the majority or Grionelliansl
will see at teast one it not two of the,
big ollt-ofrtown games, toua at Iuwrt'
city the 20th. and Drake at Des Moines
two wechs latcr. ‘

The addition or another home game
for one or the Norernhcnopen dates
is, however, almost the unanimous
wish or the student hotly.

Until the college administration is
ahle to agree on names tor the six
unit composing the new men’s dorm'
lOl'y group, it is up to the men at the
school to call the dorms by the least
ottensiie names possihle.

The word “cottage" is pel'lccuy,
proper in its name, but as the units
or the women quadrangle have hccn
called iir that name since the (Inlr
struct on. nothing can lie said in la
or its adoption by the men. At least,
let‘s call our i en's homes by some
names which will not coniuse them
with the women‘s. At present that!

to the women's quadrangle, even
