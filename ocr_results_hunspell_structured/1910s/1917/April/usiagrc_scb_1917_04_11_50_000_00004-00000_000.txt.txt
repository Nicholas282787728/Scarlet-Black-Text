day work will he llmlor the direction
of Captain Muinma, while the Weducss
day drill will be under the supervision
of one of the cadet officers from the
State university. Captain Munima
will probably bring two assistants
with him for the Saturday morning
training.

The question of abolishing athletics
was discussed, and it was thought that
there is little likelihood of such dis-
continuance. An attempt will be made
to arrange things so that v
can take the drill.

The expenses or the affair are to be
partly met by those who take part,

each man being asked to give not more ,

than fifty cents. Dr. Sprsgne said.
“'We will raise the rest. though I don't
know who 'We’ are."

Any men who wish to enroll should
see Waldo Norris or George McAlmon
as seen as possible.
