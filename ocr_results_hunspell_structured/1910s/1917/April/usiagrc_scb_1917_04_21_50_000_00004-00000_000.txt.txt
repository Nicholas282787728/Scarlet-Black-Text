NUT Tl] REEIJGNIZE LABTIR UNIIJN

Bailey-Marsh Cu. W 1 Not Acknowl-
edge New Orgnnization.

(From Grinnell Herald.)

The Bailey»\larsh company, which
has the contract for the new men’s
dormitories at the college, has decided
not to recognize the new labol‘el‘s' un-
ion, which was organized in Grinnell
a few days ago. ' Bailey. ﬁne of the
members of the firm, is in the city to-
day and explained that the position
taken by the company conveyed no an-
imus at all against the local men who
have been working on the buildings,
but was simply a matter of principle
against the recognition or the union.

He said that the company hatl tried‘

recognizing such a union at another

place and as a result or the experience‘
at that time had decided not to do it‘

again.

The company, he said, had expected‘

to pay the men more Wages Without
their asking for it. Wages are based
on supply and demand and the com—
pany did not wish the men to work for
less Wages than they could live on, but
it did not feel that it could give up its
position as regards the union.

Additional men have been secured
and Work on the buildings has ro—cnm-
niencetl. The force 01' men now em<
played will be added to as time goes
on.
