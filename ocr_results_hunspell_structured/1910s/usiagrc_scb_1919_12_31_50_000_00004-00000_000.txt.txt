STEINER’S NEW BﬂUK
POPULMTH PRESS

Sanctus, Spiritlls & 00. Given
Enthusiastic Reviews by
Many Papers.

. Steiner's new book, sanctus,
Spiritus & Company, is receiving
some one press notices all over the
country. The following editorial ap~
peared recently in the Hartford, Conn,
Courant:

Stnotns Spirihls mill Company.
By Edward A. Steiner, George H. De-
ran Company, New York. The scene
of this remarkable story is ﬁrst, and
chiefly, in a northern village or Hun-
gary, where the Slovaks were in the
majority, the Magyars were the gov—
erning minority, and the Jews were
powerful by their wits and wealth.
The characters that appear on-the
stage are so numerous and diverse
that in their relations and intercourse
the customsmuanners, dress and mani»
told peculiarities oflthe people or that
region, and their racial and political
antagonisms, as well, the story is com—
plex. Sanctus, Spiritus and Company
is composed of three elderly men, Fa—
' their Tnton Kalman, a Rolm'sh priest,
Moritz Redlich, a Jew; and Pan Szen»
itzky, a stern Calvinist, all line old
gentlemen and fast friends, survivors
of the good old times when men or di
rerent races and religion could live tea
gather in amity. The story of their
friendships, trials and sorrows is lull
of power and pathos, interwoven as it
is with so many other vital threads
Again the story turns upon the for»
tunes of a young Slovak, who goes to
America, works in coal mines, gets an
education, becomes a preacher, returns
to his native village much America
ized, mixes in religion, love and po
tics there, and is compelled to seek
refuge in America. There he is Rev.
'John nruhy, minister of a church
composed of Slovak aliens. The war
breaks out, and because these people
have foreign names and manners they
are brutally persecuted by insensate
- "patriots." Mr. Steiner's patriotism
needs no delense, and his description
of the indignities and crueitles inﬂict-
ed during the war upon innocent and
loyal people of toreign lineage and
language, is enough to make one hang
his head for shame. What is most
shamernl‘ is that ministers ol the gos«
pel were as guilty in this base busi-
ness as any of the politicians. Aside
from the three old men whom we have
mentionedﬂ remarkable trio—there
are several characters in the story,
Jews and Gentiles, men and women.
We have read the book with intense
and unflagging interest. it is a great
story, rich in color, ahounding with
humor and pathos, and one has styled
it ”the epic ot the immigrant."

Gobs of Mystery
Surround Quad
Robber

, Mystery ‘in great gobs still sur-
rounds Lhe’Bl‘aginton robbery case in
which Miss Mary Braginton, '20, was
robbed of eleven dollars 0r wasn't
she robbed? Anyway, here are the
harrowing details:

Late Monday alternoon a man,
whose excuse tor being in the Quad
rangle was that he was a conveyor of
suit cases wits encountered by Miss
Bl'aginton running frantically down
the Quadrangle loggia.

In spite of his extreme agitation he
made it known that he was searching
tor anyone or all of the occupants of
loom 422. This being the Approxie
mate number at Miss Bl'aglnton‘s cell,
she made known the fact.

"Have you lost any money?" asked
the suit case conveyor. To her know—
ledge she had not but upon investiga—
tion she found eleven dollars missing
rrom her handbag which she had left
in her room.

Her loss being brought to light the
knight of the suitcase handed over ten
dollars of the amount wrapped in a
handkerchiet

His explanation was a bit vague, He
was carrying suit cases up the stairs
when he observed a fellow male in the
process of inadvertently dropping the
money. Believing that it had heen
eto.en he immediately hunted tor the
owner.

Was someone the victim or a lively
imagination? Maybe spirits had some—
rbing to do with iti Work out your

Math. Department
Gets Unique Machine

lndi dual copies or the questions
will probably be given the student in
future exams in mathematics. That
department has a new Hammond Mul-
tiplex typewriter which writes not
only the usual letters and numbers
but also mathematical symbols. With
this machine one copy or the exam.
will be typewritten, and then more
copies will be made by some duplir

The typewriter makes plus, minus,
multiplication, and division signs, par-
entheses, radicals, and various other
symbols, including the more com—
monly used Greek letters. *Exptments
and subscripts may be made in their
proper places in smaller type. A
change from black to red writing may
be made by shitting a lever.

(From Collegian Reporter, Moi-nig-
side.)

sentence on the blackboard and turn-
ing to his class said: “Men, 1 shall be
gone tor the rest olthe examination."

on the blackboard was written-

“You can’t crib at Elle lied-Side of
your patient"

Yea, Women Are
Foolish—But
Men!

(From the Iowa State student.)
Woman, thou art vain! Even as a
bird dost thou like Lo preen thy feath-
ers. Year. of course, thou art as wise
as Solomon, as clever and virtuous as
the Esther or old who triumphed over

1ber enemies, as sweet as the Biblical

Ruth. Yet, still thou art Vainl Even
might it be said thou art foolish, Thou
believes: this not? Then listen! To
he dainty and fastidious must thou
use Dial-kiss and Mary Garden and
Melba, and Harmony and Junteel and
Armands, and me old standby Col—
gates powder on your noses For a
pair of novelty silk hose thou payest
seven dollars without a murmur. Shoes
at twenty dollars phasest than not.
Ribbons and veivets thou iovest—yea
even purple veivets and one linen.

Thou Wonlt‘lst rather hank thine
ears for winter than reiniorce thine
brain with knowledge. Thou takest
ten times the time necessary tor thy
work. On committees thou invest to
talk. Thou rorgettest mat solicitude
helps develop the great and deep
thinker.

But man—even tho he hast all the
v' illness of language at an Arthur
Brisbane, tile poetry of a Browning,
the patience ot Job—yea, he is ten
times more foolish than woman.

What? It is not true? Then why
the "Little Peer," the “Suhset Trail,”
the "La Garcia,” “Muriel," the “Tiher»
ms," the "Lucine," "George v," "Van
Dyke," the ”Isabella," the "Mozart,"
the "El Somora," the “Douglas Fairs
banks," the “El Tax-s." and "Critic"
cigars? And, if that is not enough.
did not the manufacturers name one
brand "Justice." as il in an effort to
justify himsell.

And, it still, this is not enough, why
the “Hulnus.” the “Dal/Ora," the "San
Felige," the “St. Charles," the “Run
lona," the “Union League," the "Ni-
gl‘u," the "Little Hampshire," the
“Alta" and the "heads Where none
may follow. genuine “Northwestern”
tobacco?

And can men agree on things? They
can? Then we wish they had been
sent to congress. They are economi—
cal? They are on some points. Let
a man get a pipe he likes and he will
keep it up till it walks away on its
odor.

Lo, it is necessary even to take it
tar away and bury it, and never to
breathe a word at it again, else he
will go many miles to own it once
again,

But for silk shirts he will pay dr—
teen dollars and fﬂl‘ tur collared leather
coats many times more. Yca, even
Solomon and David were not arrayed
as many young men at average cir—
cumstances.

Yea, women are roolish—but men!

It there is one born every minute,
the teilow who thinks he is "pulling
something on the teacher" when he
doesn't get his lessons wasn‘t born on

 

the halt-minute—Mlchlgan Dally.
