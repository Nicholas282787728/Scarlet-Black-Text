Track thleiics Are
other Reasons.

Intercollegiate baseball at Grinnell
has been abolished, according to action
taken at a iaeuity meeting this week
and announced Thursday. The sport
is to be discontinued for one year,
after which time the results will dc-
ter-mine whether it will be I'c»cst:ib—
iishcd or permanently abolished.

The reasons given by the [acuity tor
the action are tlrat the baseball scheds
ule always results in a loss iiuoncial-
ly‘, that very little interest is taken by
the students in the sport, that it savor-s
too much or the spirit or professional
ism. and that it inter-icres materially
with the success of the track squad.

With the inter-collegiate sport abols
ished more attention will be given to
illll'ztsiiiura) baseball, and it is probe
able that two new baseball diarrionds
will be constructed in tire spring, it
was stated. These will be great in—
centives for more class games, and
”scrub" contests.

S. .b B. started Discussion.

The abolishing of baseball comes are
ter airnost two years of discussion,
during which time the question has
been argued pro and con by students,
aluriinr. and proies‘sors. The proposi-
tion was up in 1915, and last Bebi-ua
The Scarlet and Black started the dis-
cussion anew by a lengthy edito 'al on
"Track vs. Baseball," This was based
on an article in the Des iioines Regs
ister which shorved that Drake had
the highest ranking in track of any oi
the Big Four or the state schools,
Iowa, Anoes, Drake, and Grinnell.
Drake is the only one of the tour that
does not support intercollegiate bases
ball, instead, concentrating all ener—
gies on track. The Scarlet and Black
favored Crrnneils dropping baseball,
both to concentrate on track, and to
develop' inti-a-iiinral baseball to a
greater extent.

Allclltlimce Not Large.

The Board of Athletic Control next
took the matter up, and through The
Scarlet and Black asked that alumni
and students express their views on
the matter. Several articles on both
sides appeared, which resulted in an
increased interest in baseball last
spring. Tire attendance at the games
was not large, however, arid the Board
of Control recommended to the tacully
that baseball be dropped ior a year as
an experiment.
