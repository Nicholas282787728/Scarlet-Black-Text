“DREAM OF WORLD UNITY”
IS SUBJECT AT VESPERS

D1. Steiner Discusses Meaning of§
. European Conﬂict.

The first Vesper serrice ot the year
was made impressive in the minds of
many students by the masterly ad-
dress given by Dr. Steiner, and by the
e\‘el'rftplll'ecizltetl rendition or ticuuoti's
”Saucttis."

"A precious metal appears, runs
along in great quantities through veins
in the rotks then is lost forever,"
said Dr. Steiner in the beginning or
his’ talli.

“Tile dream at world unity was
thought to hare been realized in rari-
oils ages, eHel] in our 0W“ age. but
now that dream seems utterly broken.

“iliist our nation become partisan in
this? Great erents cannot be judged
at the time they occupy the stage so
we must suspend judgment tor ire, too,
hare sinned. All churches lltive ooine
short ot the realization ot brotherhood.

“As individuals. also, we harc
failed, No progress is as slow as
moral progress. The ideal we are
trying to impress upon other has not
yet heroine our own. We have not
neaiied ourselves from the war spirit.
The dearest thing to a college student
is a college scrap. ‘
