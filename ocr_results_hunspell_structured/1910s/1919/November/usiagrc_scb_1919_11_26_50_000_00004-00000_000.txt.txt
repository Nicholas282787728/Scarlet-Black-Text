Grinnell to Play
Newton Turkey Day

On Thanksgiving Day the local high
school closes its 1le football season
by clashing with its time honored
rival, Newton high school. The rivalry
between these two aggregations al»
ways calls iorth supreme ciiort from
both teams; Newton and Grinnell will
ﬁght each other ior every inch be-
tween the goals on Ward iield.

The season's dope makes Grinnell
slightly the favorite; their victories
over Iowa City and Marshailtown and
the narrow margins by which they
lost to West High and to the power—
inl Oskcioosa eleven are Just a shade
better than Newton‘s slate. But dope

. never ﬁgures in a Gi’innell-Newton

battle. Two primed and determined
gage in a males that will result in
success or {allure of their season's
hope.
