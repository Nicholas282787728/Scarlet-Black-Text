NORMAN HALL—GRIND LLIAN.

During the last two days Grimiell
has been host to one of her greatest
alumni. Probably no other loan has
done so much during the recent years
of the war to put Griniiell on the map
than has Captain James Norman Hull,
journalist. soldier, and aviator,

‘ When we last had occasion to spcal:
of liiiu editorially he had been shot
down behind the German lines, a ric-
tirn of an uncertain fate. But. oltho
profoundly regretting his loss, as we
believed at the time, we did not mourn
him, ﬁrst, because we believed he
would not Wish to be mourned, and
second, bccause ire gloried in the fact

Vthat Grinnoll had been able to give »

such a man to America, and to the
cause tor \lhicll she was ﬁgntnig.
Now he is hack in America, and hacli
ztt Grinneli. We glory (wen more in
this, lor he has horn of the gteate .
service to his country, and yet his
his has been spared to continue m the
worl: in which he was formerly en—
gﬁged.
, Grillnell has had a large munher of
famous graduates since that little

group of pioneers came west to found I

a new college in 1847. but there lS nonc
whom We call “Gl'imielliall” w i t h
greater pride or Withinorc just admir-
tttion than Captain Hall. He is a
living embodiment of the Giiiiucll
Spirit. We may point to him and say
"THERE is at Gi-innell MAN."

“"5 UP TO YOU.

Do ybu remember, just after the
armistice was signed and the war was
over, when you were still in the army,
or a member or the good ship "U. 5.
Navy” wiry, you‘d have studied
twelve hours a day and gone to classes
six, Wouldn’t you, it you could only
get back into the good old civ'les again?

One day your discharge came thru,
you climbed into that old shit that had
been pack’ed away in moth halls ever
since you started on the trail of M
Hollenzollern, and came back to G n-
neii, For awhile your theory worked,
and so did you. Perhaps once in a
while you even hurncd the midnight
oil. and maybe you even bought a pair
of hormrrmmed specs to help your
cyes hoop up the awful pace.

But it didn't last. You might have
imown it wouhhrt. After awhile you
dropped hack into the same oltl suail's
Dace that you travcicd hoiorc the war.
The midnight on rcinsed to burn, and
tho lioru-rninncd spccs were cast
aside.

You are going home for a vacation
now. upon you come back, see if
you can’t get a little of the old—time
“lien," and What's more, see rr you
can’t lrccll it

There are less than three months
left or this colicgc year. What are
you going to do with then]?

'WHAT ill] YUU THINK?

THOSE ROSES.

As Seen by all Alumnus.

The writer's enjoyment of the Girls’
Glee Club concert last Friday evening
was marred by a very practical con-
sideration: The sight of the many
empty rows of seats. A solid third
of the house unsold meant two things:
ﬁrst, many of the students were miss-
ing one of the real musical treats of
the your; Second, Glee Club ﬁnances
were Suffering accordingly.

Part of the reason for this poor at-
tendance may lie in the unfavorable
weather and in the rival attractions of
a. big photo-piay.dow town. But it is
an open secret that many students who
intended to go changed their minds a
few days before the concert, because
of the revival, or rather the introduc-
tion, of the fashion of sending flowers,

with
pcnse.
The fashion at sending a gift or
flowers before lhe‘Gii
concert is an innovation, not a ti-adir
tion. It was never done in Grinnell
belore last Friday night, Even the
similar fashion in connection with the
Men's Glee Club concert is by comparr
ison a thing of yesterday. it is less
than onerﬁlth as old as the College,
and even before the war hastened its

its consequent prohibitive are

To many alumni, who had hoped that
the custom was permanently aban-
doned, the present effort to revive and
extend it is a great disappointment.
More, it constitutes a possible danger
to Grinnell democracy.

There is no use in arguing for the
domociacy or doing what one pleases;
in claiming that onc need not follow
the fashion if he does not want to.
That is logical to be sure; the only
trouble is that it does not work. when
logic runs counter to a fundamental
human instinct we follow the instinct
and chuck the logic. one fundamental
human instinct is fashion-following.
We are all like sheep. Let ten leap it
difficult fence; the rest must also leap
the fence or remain behin ; the ob-
vious, logical open gate is disregarded.
ll ton send flowers \vc must all send
ﬂowers, or stay away and leave our
girls to shift for themselves.

There is only one way to suppress
the custom: the voluntary refraining
01 those who are able to indulge them-
selves in it. Let Lhc.girls make it
under-stood that they would prefer to
have their floral gi[ts at other Limes.
Let the men who can afford such res
membranccs by all means continue to
send them, but not With parvenu
ostentatioiisness nor in such a manner
as to make the custom virtually
lobligatory on men or more limited
means. Thus will the interests of all
be served, with none the loser.

A LOCAL ALUM Us.
