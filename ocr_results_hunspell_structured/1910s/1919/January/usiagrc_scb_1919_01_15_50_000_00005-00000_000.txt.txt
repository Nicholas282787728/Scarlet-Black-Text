Making a clean sweep ot the annual
inter-class basket ball series the Selr
icrs won the class championship for
the second time during their four
years or interrelass competition.

The ﬁnal game between the Seniors
and Freshmen on Saturday was won
by the Seniors, 214;. '

The ﬁrstbalf was marked by the'
failure of the Seniors to make their
shots good. During this period the
Fresh were guarded closely but niadc‘
the most at their opportunities to.
score. in the second half the upper-
classmen pulled together and scored
sixteen points after being headed nio-
nicntarily by the Frosh at the begin-
ning of the period.

FresliluL'u Score First.

The ﬁrst year men drew ﬁrst blood
when Krasuskl tossed in a long shot
from near the center of the floor a few
seconds after the whistle blew at the
beginning of the game. The other
lone counter in‘the ﬁrst half was made
from a tree throw by Talbot. The
Seniors pushed the play and kept the
ball in Freshman territory most of
the half.

The Fresh smted a rally at the
beginning of the second half which
was cut short by the Seniors after the
Fresh obtained a 6-5 lead over the
1919 team. From then on the game
belonged to the Seniors. Eight count-
ers were rung up from the ﬁeld before
the ﬁnal whistle blew. The Frosh sub-
stituted Higlcy for Weiss and Norris
for Talbot in a vain effort to break up
the play of the Seniors, but the 1919
team could not be stopped and the
game ended with that Frosh on the
short end of a 2176 score.

ltrasuskl Scores Mosh

Krasnski scored four of the ﬁve
ﬁve points which the Fresh team had
to their credit, while Sauerman was
high man for the opperclassmen with
nine points, Each man on the Senior
team caged at least one goal from the
ﬁeld and no one man stood out above
the others in the game.

China Needs Help .

w, '1‘, Mills, Y. M. C, n. secretary at
Pekin, China, spoke on the present-day
problems of China and the influencc
on America, in chapel yesterday, emr
phasizing the opportunity to help that
China offers

“China is willing, and ready as never
heloi-e to receive help from us," Mr.
Mills said. “She needs the help of
our diplomacy. She needs our help
in ﬁnancial matters. She needs for
inorc'our help in giving to her all of
that social experience, which has risen
out or our Christian conscience and
ideals."

“China’s trouble is due to calrups
tion and weakness within, not with-
out. She is struggling to establish at
real democracy. China needs the
Oh ‘ tian conscience."

in visiting thc_Chinese students at»

MAUDE POWELL HEARD

IN BRILLIANT REBITAL

Violinist Pleases Audience With
Sonata by American Corn.
poser Carpenter.

The third concert of the Gi-innell
School of M ' Recttal Course took
k Chapel last Saturday
evening, when Maud Powell, the re-
nowned American violinist gave a v30.
lin recital. The Auditorium was well
ﬁlled and, if one may‘jnlige from the
prolonged and enthusiastic applause,
the audience was well pleased. The
Program was attractive and unconven-
tional in that it contained none of the
hackueyed iiuinhcrs which traveling
virtuosi continually use to display
their superiority.

The Allegro Aperto from the Mozart
A maior Concerto opened the program
and was altogether creditably Del-A
formed. tho one missed the more subtle
delicacy and warmth that character-
ize that master’s works.

0f exceptional interest was the
Violin and Piano Sonata by Carpenter,
played with commendable clarity, re-
ﬁnement and perfect ensemble. The
opportunity of hearing a large compo-
sition by an American composer play-
ed by a great artist on a concert tour
may be termed one of the compensa—
tions or the warsmay it have to be
a lasting innovation, for it would truly
beneﬁt the American audience as well
as the American composer 7 to say
nothing or the performer. The compo-
sition is a worthy one, the more in
the nature of a Suite than a Sonata.

The remainder of the program'was
well varied with pieces large and
small—all effcctivc and interesting.
To insistent demands for encores
Mme. Powell responded generously.

Special mention should be made of
the excellent work at the piano by Mr.
Axel Skjerlle _ both as accompanist
and soloist. The group of piano solos
added to the program were a delight
and well deservdtl the hearty applause
they received.

Are Dancing Teachers
To Pay Their Pledges

Dancing classes are bring organized

tion will be unofficial, but Comes in
response to a demand li-om treshman

this week 01 the latosl. table in “baby"

The idea. was started last year when
a group of advanced language students
obtained permission from Mrs. L. M.
Trder to withdraw their names from
the usual list and Start a table of their
own.

The fortunate coming of the French
girls, Misses Gabrielle Guillaume and
Nellie Noble, this year, furthered the
idea. Misses Mine. Gildersleeve and
Helen M. Evers are heads of the Span-
ish speaking table.

Although “passcz le dictionnairc" is
a common sentence, the growing pope
iilarity oi these tables is unquestioned.
