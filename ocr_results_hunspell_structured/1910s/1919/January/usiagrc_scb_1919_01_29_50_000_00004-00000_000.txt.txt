Grinnell Man Invents
New Rubber Substitute

A new substitute for rubber has
been invented by Dr. E. R. Talley of
Grinnell. A sample was sent to the
International Chemical Co,, and their
analysis pronounced the substitute to
be a good product.

John A. Wilkinson, Associate Profes-
sor of Ames, says: "From the tests
made, the material would seem to have
the characteristics necessary to make
it a substitute for commercial articles
made of rubber. It does not deterior-
aie on long standing, has as much
durability as “rubber, and possesses
the quality of vulcanization to a high
degree." -

A letter gram Scott MacEacbron Who
is at present located in New York city,
gives us news of former Grinnellians.
He Writes that Rex Swan surprised
themicoming in unawarm from Camp
Sheridan As they Were planning that
evening to entertain Ed Hadley who
sailed for Constantinople January 13,
and E. S. Turner who expects to sail
for Manila again soon, they had a
pleasant little reunion.
