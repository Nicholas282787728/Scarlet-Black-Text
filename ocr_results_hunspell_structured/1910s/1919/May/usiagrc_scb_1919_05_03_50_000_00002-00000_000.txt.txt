SATURDAY, our 3, 1919.
“PIPE DOWN."

"A little knowledge is a dangerous
thing." Egutism is one of man’s
worst enemies.

Did you ever

'21.

became acquainted
with a man who “knew it all”, one
who, no matter what subject was ,
iii-ought up in the ordinary course of
conversation, had either been there, or
had heard all about it, or who felt it
necessary to interrupt every other
niinute inst to make sure that you
we aware of the extent of his knuwe
ledg’ That man wonders why he
fails to make friends.

Then there is another type, the man
who wants to do something worlh
while, hut duesn‘t think he can. He
lacks sclE»conﬁdence. That man
wouldnt' even make a good eler iir er
grocery store,

But did you ever notice the man who
makes egotism a virtue? He knows
a few things, and knows he knows
theiri, but he ‘doesn't go around telling
ev yhody about it. That man doesnt’
have to wonder wiry he fails to make
friends. He has them.

Egotisnr can he made a hindrance,
'hut it can also he made a stepping
stone to success. John D. Rockefeller
would never have amassed his great
iortnne, if he had thought he couldn't
do it, and there was no rise even try»
ing. not he believed he could make
a ﬁnancial success, and he did. He
knew he had brains, but he didn't tell
anybody about it except John D.
Rockefeller

if you know you know something,
just keep it to yourself, Sooner or
later the rest of the world will ﬁnd it
out, and will giyc you the credit, ‘

A—ﬂc
MKS-PLACE]! SLUGS.
(From the Michigan Daily). ‘1

Did you ever see a misplaced line
,while reading a newspaper? it usu-
ally is air unaccountable jumble at
letters, or perhaps the line reads “1)—
side doun, or maybe one line is too
far away from the line it is snpposcd
to follow. This is what, in newspaper 1
circl :, is called a nus-placed slog. l

When it appears iii the paper, it,
stands out so prominently that it at—
tr-aels the attention immediately. It
usually causes derision and laughter,
and if the slug \ re able to feel, it
wEuld feel very tor-loin and out of,
place in its uncomlortahly prominent;
position. 5i

How many miss placed slugs therel
are in life: How many men hare been
ini placed in the inane-rip of their,
e istcnce! How many are there who
do not fit in with their surroundings,
who do not read smoothly with the,
rest or the world! _

Tire nilsrplztcetl slug iii lliciicwss
papei is the r ult of caiolcssn o
the part of the man who corrects the
prool. But no one corrects the proof
of a mans me except the man him
self. if he becomes a mi placed sing
it is his ow'nfault. It r. the result or
his own carelessness, his own lack
of foresight or of proparednc. s for the
future.

There is nothing more pathetic in
life than a misrplaccd slug.
