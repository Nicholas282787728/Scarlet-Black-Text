ANNUAL MAY PABEANT
TO BE GIVEN MAY 23

Dancers Will Interpret “The
Golden Wis Written by
Bessie Hatﬁeld, ’19.

The annual May pageant will be
given on the south campus, during the
May festival, May 22, 23 and 24, accord-
ing to an announcement made by Miss
Clara Andersen yesterday. It is an
original allegory written by Bessie
Hatﬁeld, 319, entitled “The Golden
Wish." The theme is based on the
longing or EVei‘yWOman tor the things
which sausry, and is exempliﬁed by the
struggle between Sellishness and Ser-
vice.

The Little Golden Wish is an out-
ward manifestation of this longing and
depicts the vacillation between the mo-
tives of selfishness and service.

The scene opens showing the abode
or Everywoman, the House of the
Heart from which there are two door»
ways. One is called “The Land of No
Man Knoweth Where" and the other is
known as “The Land or Happiness."
