Funk and Fearing of Ft. Dodge, Gos-

Packer of Sioux City, Temple of
Champaign, Ill., and Dixon of Coon
Rapids make up a combination from

. which Barrett should be able to pick

a slashing quartet of bcclrs.
Funk was considered by many as
the best athlete at his school last
‘year, while Fearing graduated in 1916
and has been in the army two years.
Cossard is understood to bc a kicker
of considerable class, and Whitehill
'is also attending Culver for two years
and piloted two of that school’s elevens
at quarter. Templc is understood to
be a man of considerable football ex-
perience. His team last year Won the

GADBURY MAKES

Alter realizing about $11,000 on an

GHOST OF S. A. T. C.
HAUNTS CAMPUS

Who said the days of the S. A. T, C.
are over and forgotten?

Just as we had settled down for a
new school year of peace like we used
to have in the good old days, we ﬁnd
that there is still an S. A. T. C. in
Grinnell and a base hospital
everything:

It seems that Lyle Miller, who left
the barracks last fall bound for the
hospital in an ambulance is only now
reaching the stage of recovery, and
although he is starting in school. he
has not been declared completely rc-
covered, and is (still living at the
Grinncll hospital and getting his little
old thirty per. He appears on the
campus in uniform and still “awaits"
orders from Washington.

Miller has, as far as can be learn-
ed, the distinction of being the only
enlisted man remainlllg iii the s. A.
T. C, ill the whole coilntr in fact,
Miller is the last of the Mohicans,
so to speak. So now we are all exs
fleeting to sec Miller talie his morning
drill out in front of the barracks on
the parade grounds.

,Main Shows Mastery of Man Over

Universe, in First Sunday
Vesper Service.

“Refuse to be narrow! Refuse to be
bigoted!" was the appeal of Prc dent
J. H. T. Main in his address at Vespers
l t Sunday afternoon,

President. lnih spoke of the donnine
ion and mastery which has been given
to man and illustrated his point by
the wireless telephone which was Cam
able of enabling man to talk from the
Atlantic coast to Norway. He said
that he was "not thinking so much of
the fact but 01 the mind which con-
celved the possibility of it.”

"Years are as nothing to man Vast
races in the Sky are as nothing. He
calls the stars by name. He even
tells us of what substance they are
made. Nothing which is human is
foreign to man. Let me expand it.
Nothing ill the universe is foreign to
man. 1 am not talking of things in

the distances to the stars.

prophecy of the eighth Psalm, thcrc »

arc men who think that we should
have no interest outside of our own
terrirtory. It is contrary to Christian
civilization. Contrary to the princi—
ples of human society, They insist
that we attend to our affairs and let
others do likewise, but remember that
cur ntf‘lirs extend beyond the seas.
even to the stars.

“What 1 Want to impress upon you
is the greatness of your creative
spirit. In my own self is the embryo,
the nucleus for another world. In my
sclf is something creative. I say I
stand in awe before man, before you
as representing all the creative forces
of God."

LADDRATDRY METHDDS

"Laboratory methods of teaching
Journalism are the most successful be—
cause they approximate more nearly
than any other method the actual work,
in a newspaper office", dccla' d Pro-
lcssor R. o. Jameson, the new instruc—
lor in journalism. Mr. Jameson also
stated that while training in English
u as very important to the iouiniilist,
yet training iii economics and history
were Iai more impoitant.

“Pl'olcssors who try to nlzllte c scis
once out of journalism soon drift into
the ridiculous,” said .llr. Jameson
“The ﬁeld is ncw’and unorganized,
and the work done must be practical
and not thcorctlcul. The laboratory
method is not only practical, but it can
be ad‘ cd to all types oi students."

“'l'iai ing in Ellgllsll,” said Mr. Jain-
csou, nocc. ly in tlic journalist,
but training in history and cconomics
are far more Illlpurtant‘. A city edi-
