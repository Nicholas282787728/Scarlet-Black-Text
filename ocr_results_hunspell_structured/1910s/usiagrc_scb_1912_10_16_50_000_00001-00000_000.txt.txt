WILSDN BLUE DN DRESS PARADE

Seventy-Five Collegian: March In
Body to Hear Nebraskdn’s
Address.

At least four thousand people
listened on Monday morning while Wil~
liam Jennings Iii-yon riayed Tait anrl
Roosevelt and asked ior trniterl support
ior Woodrow Wilson, The weather was
periect, the College Woodrow Wilson
Cirrb was on hand with colors ﬂying,
the crowd was enthusiastic, and Mr
Bryan himselt was in excellent spirits,

Mr. Bryan's address centered around
ﬁve niaili points: The income tax and
Talt’s attitude toward rt; the attitude
or tile Democratic party on
progressive pleasures; and then,
one alter another, Tait, Roose-
velt and Wilson. By way or introduc-
tion Ml'. Bryan urged the support or
the local tlcltet, tor a Democratic presi-
dent withorlt a Democratic Congress
would he very seriously handicapped.

The most interesting parts oi the
speech concerned Tait and Roosevelt.
M- Bryan seemed to take delight in
hnr rig in rapid srrccessioii all or the
hits or sarcasm that had occurred to
him iii a long prlblic career and yet
behind it all there w a a strength and
a seriousness that wonvthc crowd. The
main idea that ran through his attack
was that neither Tait or Roosevelt
could be called progressive in any sense
whatever. “Roosevelt worild not help
La Folletle, the prince or progressives,
to dereat Tait within the Republican
party; instead he tried it himselt and
when he was dereated torme‘d a new
party,” he said. ”The stcanrrollcr at
Chicago was a magniﬁcent machine but
it was secondhand. it was handed
down iroai iour years ago and every
bolt and nut bore the initials T, R.
Ever-y boss who helped nominate
Tait had helped nominate Roosevelt,
Roosevelt never had_an honor not con.
[erred by Wall Street.”

Mr Wilson was treated very bricrl -
"in place oi Tait. tried and round want-
ing, in place at Roosevelt who has had
the pi'esidcncl' tui and did nothing,
support Woodrow \vilosu. lie is on the
people's side and he has the ability and
moral courage to stand unairaid iii the
presence or innuences which lime
\\ recited many administrations."

while the ,, eech would have been
more pleasing to many it Mr. Bryan
had given a more serious discussion oi
the plattoi-ins. Mr, Bryan undoubtedly
gave one or the strangtst campaign
speeches cver delivered in iowa. it
was popular, too, even as he said: “I
say enough against Tait to please the
Roosevelt men, enough against Rouse-
velt to keep the Tait rnen in good
humor, and enough against both to
make the democrats happy."

he has conducted meetings, He is as»
sociated in his work with John R,

Owing to a misunderstanding on the

tliorities, there will he no game bee
tween the Baptists and Gl'innell this
y'eill'. The list of eligillles which was
submitted to Gl‘iunell included fresh»

that the names oi ﬁrst year lneri be
taken on, Tile Des Moines authorities
took this as a cancellation oi the con-
tract and pl'oteetleil to schedule on-
otlicr game, without irilorlning Grill-
nell.

After some discussion on the part oi
the local athletic committee, it was
decided to allow Dos liloillcs to use
her il-esllultn rather than not to play
the Baptists at all, and a leter was
sent giving them permission. Yester-

As no game had bccn scheduled to

Good Work In Line—Score
Compares Well With
Iowa/s,

Tile showing made by the football
team in winning by a as to 3 5201';
irom Normal Saturday was rather
more i'arorable than had been expected.
This may have resulted irorn the de-
cirlctl mediocrity ol the opposition inr—
nished by the i. s. T. team, or it may
have hccn due to the rapid develop-
ment or our own team during the past
week. lt plobahly resulted irom a
combination oi the two. Be that as it.
may, we were able to exceed the
score which iowa rolled up against the
same team a week before. or course,
iowzt probably played substitutes, a:
least during a part of the game, bui:
“an examination oi the record of Sat—
urday's m ~uill show that the Grinnell
lineup during the second and fourth
quarters was made up entirely or sub.
stitutes, with the exception oi one or
two men.

The showing or this substitute elcrea
was probably the most encouraging as-
pect oi the garlic. Tillie and again the
second-string backs waded through the
opposing team ior substantial gains,
and the work or the whole reserve
squad compared iavorably with that or
the 'Vdrs' y.

Probably the most surprising icatnr-e
oi the game was the speed and ability
at Opellrﬂeld running displayed by
lilacy, who is lecc' g a trial at help
back. He got away several times from
runs oi 15 to 40 yards, but ll‘ best
run or the day, a loeyaid sprint ior a
touchdown, did not get into the records
because the ball was called back on he
count or otiside play.
