Thc Univ-e , ty at Montana, which
closed its doors more than
weeks ago, has been forced to close
again even before classes were re
somcd because of the inﬂuenza epi—
dehiic. The students have been doing
their work by correspondence during
the quarantine period and telegrams
announcing the reopening of the uni-
Vel'sity on Dec. 3 were sent to all those
who hall gone to their homes. Before
all thc students were-back the epi—
demic showed an increase, and tele-
grams were sent out countei‘manding
the first message. The duration of the
quarantine is indeﬁnite.
