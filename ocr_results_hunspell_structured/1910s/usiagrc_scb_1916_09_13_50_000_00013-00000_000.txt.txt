"You hare come here to take your
own life and project it into the fli—
tilrc. Are you able to lead your life
through these four formative years?
The responsibility is on you."

This “as the keynote of Protessor
Edward A. Steiner's address to the
Freshmen at the opening chapel this

important question," he .nontinuod.

wercd, will tell us whether you are
city or country bred, and u at has

idly losing its signiﬁcance."

But the most searching question, the
speaker pointed out, is "new old are

eilce in lilo. It depends on how much
a man has tried rather than how long.
