' 0 COACH )lt'ililﬂlfy A( “N!

No football coach has ever done as much for Gi-innell as has Win. U
McAlmuu during the past two years, Coming to the College when there
was practically no experienced niatciidl out of which to build a team, he
soon brought forth an eleven which hits defeated all corners in the Iowa
Conference for two seasons.

It is a matter of doubt as to whether he will return ncrt year, lle has
resigned, it is true, but the document has r t been accepted by the Board of
Control. He is also reported to have spoken favorably on another season,
so it is barely possible that he may return. Grinnell is hoping, for if there
ever has been a football coach who has been admired hcre, it has been Coach

Wm. U. ‘hicnlmon.

THE TEAM.

None too lunch can be said in praise of those men who represented
Grinnell on the gridiron this season. When the year began, with three 11114
Conference men missing, wc doubted their ability. Could they win another
championship, or not? Then, we thought not, biit within but a few weeks
they have proved their

worth and shown that they are winners, ereu though
not members of mythical elevens.

The season this year was a hard' one. The State University, Beloit, Coc
and Drake University are four prelt, trong teams to meet in as many
weeks. Yet “the boys" toed the line. forced a line sinash four times and
made first downs in three cases out of the (our. That is a record worth

while.
Much of the success of the season is due to the “scrubs," '25, for more
than has been supposed. No matter- what you may think, the strength of
a varsity eleven is always to be measured by the second string men who
have opposed them. Look at the scrubs and you' can be sure to tell the
strength of the first tcam. This year the scrubs were strong. not only that.
but were pcrscvcriug and steady. They must not be forgotten, either, in
passing around the bouquets, for they were as responsible as the rar '
the championship which came to Gl'illllcll.
