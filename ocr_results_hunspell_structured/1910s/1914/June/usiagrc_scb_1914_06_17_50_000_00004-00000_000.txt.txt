SENIUIi BHAPEL IS
IMPRESﬂVE EVENT

PRESIDENT MAIN GIVES AN
INSPIRING TALK TO '
CLASS OF ’14.

TREATS FUUH LIFE ESSENTIALS

Work, Play, Love, and Worship
Are Discussed as Part of a
College Education—Sings
ing Features.

President Main ruade one or his
characteristically helplul addresses at
Ithe Senior chapel service Friday
morning, creating an impressiveness
in the service that is unequal in an)’
Commencernnot event except the Bee
calaureate and Graduating exercises.

“How boautiiul upon the mountains
are 'the-vleet, oi them who bring good
tidings," were the words which iur-
uislred the lorrudation ior President
Maiu's short but iorcoiul tallr. Carr
note “what alert Live By" lays stress
rrpon iorrr things essential to lilo
worlr, play, love and worship.

Perhaps the one thing that educa-
tion should do ior a man is to mahe
him work. mahe him capable at work
lug anytime or anywhere, whether he
tools like it or not. And so it is to be
hoped that Grlnuell has taught the
Class oi 1914 how to work in their tour
years spent hei e.

Another thing that College could give
a man is the ability to play. and the
knowledge when to play and how to
play. Too many people use their lives
or rather never ﬁnd them because they
do not know how to play, to relax, to
be tree and to drop tor a while the
cares oi liie.

Lore and worship are the other two
essentials oi lile, and they mrrst be a
par-t oi every suecessiul lire. The
loss oi the power to love, the power
to worship, to feel the power of thPl
Supreme Being, means a loss oi the
essentials oi liie.

Preriorrs to the r-lrapel address the
students sang together- with a spirir
and reverence that is unequaled an:
tirrre in the college rear the song
"Soils at Old Grinnell," and the Grill»
nell Hymn. President iiairr presented
the eight newlyeleoted members or tlrel
Phi Beta Kappa Society with their
certiﬁcates or membership.
