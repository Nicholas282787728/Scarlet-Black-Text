MISS SUI WANG TALKS Al Y. W.

Chinese Woman Appeals Through
Own Experiences.

A delightful little Chinese wonan
in the person or Miss Sui Wang. kept
a large audience completely fascinated
last Thursday evcuiug at the regular-
Y. W meeting.

. ‘ s Sui Wang is one or those rare
people who can teach without her
hearers being aware that they are re-
ceiving instruction. Her interesting
stories of life in the U ited states
and china were often interrupted bv|
a reminiscent girlish giggle, yet she
clearly brought out her main points

Miss Wang has great sympathy for
the Freshmen and gave them lour rules
lly which she avoided llolllesicklless.
she was the cout‘rdaut of many people:
she was never alone so was too proud
to give Vent to llel‘ feelings lly a
“squall"; she discovered hotnesickncss
was or no its ; her Father was here.
just as He uas in China.

After descrihius Chinese marriage
customs shc lclt the gills instructions
as to train contractions, promising
lllem some "h ds uest soup" when
lhcy came to t her.
