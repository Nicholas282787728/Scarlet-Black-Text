lege, since Mayor White issued his

little, for most of the schools are actu-
ally closed, which means classes are
suspended. In Smith college, the stu-
dents are conﬁned to their own rooms.
Grinncll will live her normal life, but
segregated from the town.

The regulations drafted liy the fac-
ulty committee of Public Health at the
special request of President Main, are
as follows:

1. Regular college work shall go on
as usual. but all» special functions,
such as chapel, vespers, receptions.
and all general meetings siiall be for
the present discontinued.

2. All members oi the college shall
conﬁne themselves to the college build
lugs and cftlilpllsishall not visit tire
business portion of the city (this does
not mean students cannot visit the
outlying districts of thc city).

3. Congestion of rooms, exits and
entrances shall be avoided.

t. Strident residents may come to,
classes and return home. s

5. Travel shall he generally discour-
aged.

Sol Butler Makes Big Gains for
Blue and White—Four Men
Injured.

6

Grinncil lost the [list game of the
stnson last Saturday when “Sol” But-
lcr, otherwise known as the Dubiiqne
football team, crossed the goal line
for a total damage of 13 points. In the
fourth quarter, a fumble gave the ball
to Dilliiique on Grinncll’s 20—yard line
and Butler carried across for the ﬁrst
touchdown. A little later the last
colored athlete intercepted a forward

pass and raced 60 yards for another
touchdown.

Time after time Grinnell advanced
the ball by long runs and forward
passes to within a few yards of the
Dilbilque goal but had luck at critical
moments kept them from scoring. The
whistle blew with Grinnell on Du»
buque's 3-yard line brrt the ﬁnal score
was still. Dubuouc 13; Grinnell, 0.

Saturday's defeat need not be taken
too seriously, for Grillilell has a team
of great possibilities and a week more
of practice ought to put them in shape
Ito go out and win for the Scarlet and
black.

Everyone is agreed that the Scarlet-
clad team lost because of their lack
of practice. Dubuque lies a good team
and “Sol" Butler is a whirlwind, we
will concede (lint. But Dubiiquc has
had a regular two-hour daily practice
for the past three weeks while on the
imllel‘ hand, Gr-inncll has had one
scrimmage and about seven horns of
practice in that tirncI The Duhuque
football team was composed mostly of
“Sci" Butler for he made all the
long gains arid most of the effective
tackling pas donc by him. Questioned
after the game, however, he laid the
cause of their victory to the work of
Fort, Parker and Dir-ksﬁfullsllack,
iguard and tackic respectively, Elite
ler said the Grinnell team was a
"clean, hard-hitting bunch." and he
emphasized the fact that we had a.
fast team but had had had breaks.

Four or the Scarlet and Black play—
ers were more or less seriously in-
nired brit all played till the crrd of the
game. in the first scrimmage Olson
threw his knee out oi ioint while
