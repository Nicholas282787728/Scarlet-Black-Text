The Newer Woman.

(From the Daily mini).

Women representatives from the
midecstel‘n colleges and universities
closed yesterday their contorsuce ot
the Woman's Sell-Government Associ-
ation: What was the signiﬁcance of
the convention? Did the mere meet-
ing at these people include the Whole
purpose of this assemblage?

To the ﬁrst question the answer lies
in the ctlcct and iruitagc which will
come ill the days when these Women
return home to their respective cola
leges to bear witness at their Journey
to Ul‘bana. The problems which have
been taken up are signiﬁcant enough
to show that the convcntion was not
in vain. For instance, the honor 53157
ten] With all its side lights and doubts
has been successrully talhcd over, and
the result will be overwhelmingly
broad if the delegates make use of the
knowledge gained through the discus-
sions with other delegates who conic
from schools wherein the honor sys—
tem has been tried. Furthermore, the
problems of vocational guidance, hous—
ing, social work, activities, and many
other questions have bruught But
abundant information (Tom the various
schools. ,

Thai: the women are exchanging
ideas on these subjects, and talking
about professions open to the woman
of today, is sulticicnt evidence to make
everyone realize that the standards
and ideals oE \vomankind have ad-
vaneed and are advancing, and a new
era has arrived for thc women.

Dutch Treat Dates
Inaugurated -at Coe

Furthcriug an idea which has been
suggcstcd by soinc of the leading coir
logo journals or the country, a move-
incnt is now on foot to estahlish an
oilicial “much Trcat Date Day” in Coc
college. Fosters ndrising all students
