“The Hel‘oisnl of Scholarship" was
the title of an address delivered by
Dr. Frank w. Gunsanlus, president or.
the Armour Institute of Technology, at‘
Herrick Chapel Friday morning, the‘
occasion being the dedication oi
Alumni Hall. This and the idea of‘
pioneer heroism was the theme‘ of
other addresses given at the same ex-
ercises, Though each was developed
in a different style, each brought out
the idea that the Grim-tell of the future
is to be the great Gl'iunell of the past
in spi
Cnn Get “Neltl'el' Heaven.”

Dr. Cunsaulus cited instances and
elaborated upon his theme that tho
scholar who is scorned is a greater-
hero than those ordinarily called
heroes, He said the man who can by
careless work produce great things,
produces things ”nearer Heaven," but
the man who, though not [ll'u-lucing
such great things, puts his very soul
into them, “is himself heal-e. yicoven."
After citing several instances of great
scholars, he closed with the statement
that it was just to instill siiclr ilrlel~
loctual martyr spirit as this that the
new recitation hall was being built.

Miss Ruby Heldel‘. tenor, who alp-

England, her native country.

Before coming to America to take
up her position on the Grinnell School

ceived luucll notice from (bi: English
music public. Some idea. of the high
standing she has there may be gleaned
from the following clipping from the

much controversy in the first case ol
such enthusiasm subsequently, as that
of this remarkable young lady tenor.

At a comparatively early age it be—‘.
came evident that hers would prove an!
exceptional voice, and her extensiveI
range excited much interest and cul'l»l
osity; in fact on the same program
(some twelve years ago) she sang a
‘soprano selection from “Faust” in the
Ifirst part. and a well known tenor‘
song in the second. Then her voice
broke, and for some time she was dis- l
may-ed to find she could sing neither“
soprano nor tcnor; but the break was
of short duration, and then appeared
the clear ringing notes 01' the genuine:
tenor range, the cultivation of which)
has resulted in the universal fame and
popularity she has acquired.

 

it is, however, most important to
notice that the marvelous nature of
her voice has been a secondary cons

“Back to the front in Spring," was
the message received yesterday from
James Norman Hall, '10, by Miss Edna
liavis of this city. He has joined the
Franco-American Air Corps.

li‘hen James Norman Hall received
his release from the English army a
year ago his friends thought that he
would never again enlist in the war.
in fact he himself had no intention of
returning to the front when he left
for France. But his intense desire for
more cxpcricnccs, and a new “war
lever" led him into enlisting in the
Fl‘allcorAmel'lcan Air Corps. He is
now learning to fly, and intends to be
at the front in the spring.

This latest decision of Mr. Hall came
as a surprise to Miss Edna Davis, who
rcccivcd the postal card from him last
Wednesday telling of his new hazard.
