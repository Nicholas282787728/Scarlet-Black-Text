Tennis men, who have been Mittens
ed to Grinncll College. have won tame
throughout the state this summer In
their excellent ability. Not only pres-
ent students, but alumni and CX-mom-
bars have put Grinnell on the map.

Captain Erl Potlle, of last year's
~ has added two pieces to his
collection or cups. One he attained
as winner in the city junior meet;
the other he won as deuhles champion,
with Fred Bradley (Dcs Homes) in
the Central Iowa Tennis Tourney.
This was held on the Country Club
courts the week of July 7, and was
probably the iastest meet in the state.

Protessor n. H. Fe '11): was the
tournament manager here and he won
many compliments on the way in
which he handled this ditricnlt task.

Ellsworth, or last year's \al'sitv, was
deieatod in the consolation [trials or
the same tourney. In the douhles,
however, he and Partner were not
eliminated until the semirlinals, when

. Pottle and Bradley, the champions, put
them not. In the TrirStaic Meet at
Burlington, Ellsworth and Partner-
were defeated in the semi-riuals
again.

Joe Van Ginkle, well known to all
Grinuellians, and a strident here him-
selr two years ago, sprang the surprise
or the state this summer. In the
state meet he won the runner'sup
cup, being deteated by Will Adams in
a {we set match. Van deteated Doc
Sinners in the semirllnals.

Doc’Somei-s met his Waterloo in the
Central Iowa meet in the seini»(inals
also. He was deteated by Geo. Baker.

H. L. Beyer was the orticial reteree

 

at the ’l‘r‘ Stale meet. lie was runner:
up in singles, hcing :lcl‘eatcd by his
doubles- partner, T. E Mussolinan.
This team easill' non the douhles
championship.

Griunell, Oslialoosa and Ottuinwa
held a lllﬂllglc meet at Oslialoosa, Lar
Imr Day, As it was an imitation al-
rair no accurate record was kept, hut
U. .l. Carney, Pottle and H. L. Boyer
won all their matches. Doe Senior
and Ellsworth were not quite as sitar
co. .‘iul

Should Pnttlc keep up his present

pace he will undoubtedly detent any- »

thing in the state this i Last year's
champion, Paul \\‘lntc, has leit ior
Dartmouth. \Vith .\loorhead and E1157

the star quarterback or the West Des
lloincs high school team and gained a
position on the mythical allrstatc team.
Last year he was captain or the rreslr
man team that furnished the vars
strong opposition and in that way
largely helped them to capture the
state title. As a result or his playing
last yearnrmdley was looked upon as
a valuable addition to the squad, and
ms loss will be hcenlv ion.

The Brock House men have moved
trom their tormer house at 1515 Broad
street and are now at 1027 Broad in
the house occupied by the Focht Club
