Interest of Audience Always At
Delight—Complete Cast Now
Is Announced—Principals
Promise Strength.

A pl ~ of American life that has
proved widely popular with American
audiences and which was written by
an Amerlcan dramatist, is to be pre-
sented jointly by calocagathia and m-
stitute societies at the Colonial Thea-
ter next Friday night when “The
Witching Hour" will be given.

Few highly reputed Aeml'ican plays
of lasting value have been presented
on the local stage Within recent years.
“The witching Hour” is to be included
as one oi these, for its literary excel-|
lency has been widely praised by‘ dl‘av
matic critics. one ot the foremost of
these, Thomas H. Dickinson, has given
Augustus Thomas a place as one or
the twenty loremost dramatists of the
world in his book, “Chief Contempor»
nry Dramatists,” which is used as a
text in Professor Ryan's drama course.

The play has not been very wideh
given in America. When it was first
presented it proved immediately pope
ular, but Thomas saw that if his play
was to escape the death which inev’
tohly comes iroin orer-popularit its
presentation would have to be some»
what limited. Being ﬁnancially sati
tied with the large i-craltics from his
earlier writings, the writer could Mr

Mental telepatliy,_the keynote ot the
play, held eastern audiences in intense
interest when it was first given. idoi
over, other subjects just as interesting
are portrayed, such as hits of United
States supreme court life, an extend-
ed political strirc, the gamhling house
with its accompanying poker game,
and numerous llmel anti interesting
fine points of law.

The story of the play is rather sini-
ple, but the plot dirrei-s rrom the ordr
nar structure in the new and unusual
points on uhiclrtlic sior hinges. The
play opens “ith a scene i a eambling
house owned by ,lack Brookrield,
where menial telepathy is the instl‘ur
mcnt which indirectl biings on a
murder. in the ensuing trial a con-
viction is obtained. but a further use
of the iiicsuiei-ic idea caiiscs the unit,
ed states supreme court to grant a
new trial. in the sccond trial mental
telepathy, more unusual than any over
before characterized in an Ame icon
blay, results in a dismissal only
through wide use or fine points ol
psychology as round in politics, newsr
papers, and law. Such a plot. invites
both thought anti wonder,

The loading parts at the play are to
be taken by Fred Hazard as Jack

ODE COACH DIDN’T THINK
MUCH OF GRINNELL—l
BEFORE DRAKE CARNIVAL

“i am not fearing Grinncll at all,"
added the coach, “they are all fizzled
out down there; their prospects are at»
ways better just before training sea-
son than in the middle of it."

Such was the comment of Coach
Bryant concerning the Drake Relay
prospects as.l7uhlished in the Coe Cos-
mos a week before the Carnival. Cos
was doped for a fast mile team, hilt
took a slow third, with a similar posir
tion in the shorter event.

Shearer Will Not Compete Here
For Bulldogs Next Saturday in
Annual Meet—Visitors
Are Strong in Field
and Distances.

Hoyt and shearer \ull not be match-
ed against each other in the Gl'lnnell»
Drake meet next Saturday, because
of tlieifact that coach Griliith or
Drake has decided to send his sprinta
or to the, Penn relay to compete
against l-iohman, Carter, and possibly
Smith, in the lilo yard dash.

From the Grinncll point or view the
absence of sbcaier from'tiie Bulldog
squad will not make any telling
change in the dope, as it is generally
‘cullcotled here that the Griiiiicll ca
ilain can negotiate either of the short
isprints ahead of the Drake runner.
0n the Des Moilles side, however, it
- iigurttl that the loss of Shcare \leI
lose Drake several points in the meet,

or con .c shearcr's trip to Penn
mom will mean that a ncw fourth

mile relay and this may weaken the
quartet to some extent But both of
the Grilmell l’tila) teams will feel the
loss of Bal‘ilen, who is not eligible to
par cilmle in this meet.

run Ross in both the halhnlle I'Iln and

Setting a new world's record for the
220 yard dash on a circular track,
“Chuck” Hoyt, the Gl'innell track cap-
tain, won the national lurking, run as
a feature event at the Drake Relay
Carnival Saturday afternoon, over a
field of stars who stand supreme
among the country's collegiate sprint-
ers. The time was :21 275 seconds,
one»[ifth slower than the world's best
time on a 220 straightaway.

From Fifth Plllee To First.

In addition to thus bringing Grin- '
nell into prominence in track circles
the continent Dvel', Hoyt snatched au-
cther victory for the scarlet and hlaclc
in the halfamile relay by drawing up
from fifth place at the start of his lap
to a slight but winning margin over
Hamllne at the tape, The local quar-
has time was L32 , thl‘ee»flfths
slower than the pr ent meet record.

not taken a had tall near the end at
his lap in this event. This is cork
