At the first. Senior chapel of the
year yesterday morning, the members
oi the class of 1917 made their first
appearance in the i'egula)‘ academic
attire ot caps and gowns. President
Main delivered the address before a
huge audience,

“The entrance of the United States
into this war will help, i trust, to
weaken the curse nt wan The cynic
may say that the world will go on
tighting and hating tor-ever, but don‘t
you believe it, men and women," de-
ciarcd the speaker.

“There are times when we must re-
sort to force,” continued President
Main. “There are times when service
means military service, and service
whether it he military or not, must he
universal, it must include the rich and
the poor, the high and the low.”

"it ill hccomes this cduuu‘y to stand
on and say that we have nothing to
do with this war. Are we to stand at
one side and get rich and quibble about.

children are dying?” he uslted. “The
way of righteousness is a hard and
stony path, but our conviction or rights

“Let us he sure that the far off Di—
vine cvcnt to which the whole creation
moves is righteousness, order, peace,
and love,” said President Main in con-
clusion. “Hate is only an incident in
life. The elementary thing in this
world is love and good will.”

house party at her home in Viliton on
Monday and Tuesday or this week. The
guests included Ruth Hall, Katherine
