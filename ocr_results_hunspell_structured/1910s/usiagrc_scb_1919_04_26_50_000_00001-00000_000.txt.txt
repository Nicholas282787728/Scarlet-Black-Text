The elecuon was biased on the
grades which the students have made
durlng their sophomore and junior

Capt. Echols To Receive Further
Enlistments Then—Number of
Men Join During Week.

With the signing of a number of the
men during the last week, plans for a
local unit of the R. o. T. C. have as»
sumed a more deﬁnite form, according
to Capt. J. n. Echols, who has been in
charge of the work here during the
temporary absence of Maj. Frank la.
Clay.

Final Decision Indeﬁnite.

The final decision as to whether a
reserve officers training corps will be
established in Grinnell has not been
reached, but will be known within a
few days. Capt Echols will be in the
clubroom of Building One next Mon-
day from 9 a. m, until 9:30 p. m. to
receive enrollments for the local unit
and‘to take measurements ror uni-
form's.

lf enough additional men signify
their intention to Join at that time, a
unit will be established. if there is
still too small a number, a personal
canvass will be made of every man in
college in an effort to bring the num-
her up to 100. A unit may be started
this spring even tho the desired num-
her is not reached.

Faculty Makes New Ruling.

The recent faculty ruling providing
that milimry training shall be allowed
as regular required physical training
will undoubtedly be a strong induce
ment to many of the men. This rule is
in force at practically no other col-
leges, military training being consid-
ered distinctly separate from physical
training.

If a local unit is established, the
equipment Will he secured'at once and
Work started immediately.

Whippet Tank With
War Relic Train Cuts
Capers On Streets

Tile antics of a small \vbippctt tank
featured the appearance of the war
relic train which arrived in Grinnell
yesterday afternoon and stayed over-
night. Tbe tank, the same type as
those used over seas, demonstrated its
ability by driving up and down the
pavcntent, twisting in and out around
autos, and whirling around in the mid-
die of the street.

The train carried a number of guns
captured from the Germans, as well as
types at French and American guns,
also a n-encb moncplane. One car
was ﬁlled with shells, bayoncts, gran.
ades, and other relics of the war.
speeches by wounded soldiers were

Rousseau and Voltaire Dream of
Disappearance of Old Re»
gime, Says Allard.

Prof. louis Allard, Harvard ex»
change professor, in his lecture on
the ”French Spirit in the Eighteenth
Century" in chapel Thursday stated
that "the social tendency
French spirit in the Eighteenth Cen—
tury was to recognize the part and
rights of man in society. In the Sev-
enteenth century it had been to enjoin
all men to recognize natural beauty.
The French spirit has spoken for the
beneﬁt of the world." ~
Philosophers Deserve Credit
The great change in thought, accord-

‘ ing to Prof. Allard, was due to Rous—

seau and Voltaire and their contem-
poraries. “The good of society, such
is the guiding ideal of these men. A!-
ter all it seems that for France these
philosophers of the Eighteenth cen-
tury have vindicated the freedom of
human thought, that they have wished
to eniranchlse all slaves. and that they
have fought for justice. They have
tried honestly to bring about the bet—
tennent of man.

“Those men of the Eighteenth cen—
tury dreamed of the disappearance of
the old regime. They slowly devel—
oped tbe power of public opinion,

JUNIORS FAVORITES AFTER
HASS LEAVES FOR RELAYS

Competition to Be Especially
Keen In Mile, Half, and '
Quarter.

.

The annual home meet which will be
held this afternoon on Ward held
promises to be one of the fastest and
most closely contested affairs of this
kind that has been held in years.

For the ﬁrst time in several seasons
the weather man has conduscended to
bring out the sun. The track is in
pretty fair condition and it is not at all
impossible that one or two of the old
records may go by the boards.

Competition To Be Even.

Instead of one or two men making
the majority of the points for their
Class, as was the case when Hoyt‘and
Harden were in the game, the teams
which will compete this afternoon pre-
sent a more balanced array of men.
There is hardly a race in which a sure
winner can be picked. Competition in
the mile, 'half, and quarter will be es—
pecially keen‘. The half is attracting
a large ﬁeld of sprinters, and the old
record of 2:041/5 may be broken.

From all the‘ dope that can be gath-
ered the juniors seem to be the favor-
ites of the meet. The sophomore stock
was weakened greatly by the loss of
Hass who left Thhmday for Philadel-
phia to compete at the Penn Relays-
which are being held this alter-noon.
Hass would have been good for about
ﬁfteen points, in the looeyard dash.
zzoryard dash, and low hurdles, be-
sides being Anchorman on the short
relay team, However, Minty, Hoyt and
Kua are sure point winners in the
events in which they enter.

‘ _ lloehmler Returns.

Boehnller returned to school yester-
day and if he competes he will be able
to win the pole vault. He has been ill-
for some time, and it is doubtful
Whether he has recovered sufficiently
to enter. His return adds to the var-
sity prospects for the coming season.

The seniors' best bet is Cowden, who
will, in all probability, cop ﬁrsts in
both the hundred and zzoryard dash,
and also take a point or two in the
broad jump. With Cowden as anchor
man the seniors will force the other
classes to the limit to win one short
rolzty. “Father" Smith will compete
in. both the discus throw and the shot

{put and Stock in the jumps and high

hurdles. Fleck and Ellsworth may
run, but both are unknown quantities
as yet this year, since neither of the
men has had timc to get into good con-
dition. They will probably run on the
’19 mile relay team.
Varsity Practice Neat Week.

The relays promise to be closely
contested this year. Each class has a.
well-balanced team. The juniors‘ mile

Wanda Eells Gives
Pleasing Organ Recital

The second organ recital of the
School of Music student series was
givcn by Miss Wanda Eells last even-
ing in Herrick Chapel before a large
and appreciative audience. The Sym~
phony by Widor, especially the second
movement was very much-enjoyed, and
her own “Variations on the Last Rose
of Summer” was greatly appreciated
by' the bearers. The composition show-
ed great originality and her interpre-
tation of it was very pleasing.

Her program was exceptionally
strong thruout and it was brought to

 

a climax in the Wagner number.
