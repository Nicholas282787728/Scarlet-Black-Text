the girls at Grinnell are superb, and it
is true. Comparison with other col-

almost all are healthy. and the ma~

was n ve » grave innit which I sau‘ in
the nothings or the Association. And
what uns it? it was because 1 round n
sparsity at true religious reeling nnrl u
sickening abundance of what 1 call
“religiosity." From one viewpoint, nil
tlle lite at a 'nnell is sucking in a re-
ligiosity which is regrettable. There
are too many prayer meetings. too

too many glib prayers, too many out

Now you Y. w. sir-ls have your meat»

little prayers at saw-dust, trotted out
each week? This then is my criticism,
that you girls wostc time in religiosity,
rerging to narrowness, suiugness and
hrprocricy, and that true rclipious rccl.
ing is below par. I would not even
make this statement now. I nrobahly
uould have ran school without expre ,

problem has iorced itself again and
