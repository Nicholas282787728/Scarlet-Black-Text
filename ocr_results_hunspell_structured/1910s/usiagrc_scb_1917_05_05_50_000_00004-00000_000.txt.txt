“Yelling gentlemen will he allowed

With more applications ror rooms
than the Women's Quadrangle could
satisiy this year, and every indication
that a still larger number of girls
will have to be reluscd adi ittancc
next year. there irequeutly arises the
question of liow soon a sixth unit will
be added to the prescnt group of cot-
tages.

According to a statement given out
by the Administration, no deﬁnite
plans have been made because of the
uncertainty or present condmons.

When the Quadrangle was ﬁnished
as it now stands, it was with tho idca'
that it would amply accommodate all
applicants for several years to come.
However, the statement cannot be
made that no building will be done
for several years, tor the reason that
all building will have to depend on
conditions. Since the materials used
in the construction of the Men's Quad-
rangle are costing almost two and
onerhalf times as much as the same
materials cost in the Women's Quad~
rangle, it is doubtiul it it will he pos-
sible to build extensively for several
years to come. unless prices settle.

As plans are now, the next cottage
added Will probably be north of Fifth _
Cottage. This cottage Will be the cure '
her or the Quadrangle; two other cot-
tages Will be erected West of this, and
the Women’s Gymnasium will make
the other corner. This completes the
Quadrangle as now planned.

The new Women’s Gymnasium will
be equipped with the most improved
type of swimming pool. showers and
other apparatus. However, with ex-
tensive building plans for a. new music
hall, the possible necessity of new
units in the Men's Quadrangle, and the
immediate need of a. new Men's Gym-
nasium, it is quite possible that Rand
Gymnasium, which is Still in excellent
condition, will he used for a number
of years to come. In such an event
it is barely possible that a temporary
swimming pool may be constructed in
