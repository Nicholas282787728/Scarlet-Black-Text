MISS MILLERD SPEAKS
0N GREEK DRAMA

The Monday chapel service was ('on-
ducted by Miss Millerd, with a brief
discussion. of Greek drama. r\liss Mil»
lerd said that it has not her belief that
the ancicnt plays portrayed lite ally
more truly or artistically than the
better Modern dramas. The Greek
plays. the same as other Greek litera-
ture, serve as interesting reﬂections of
the life and \ieus or their time.

The drama sets iorth the customs
and life 01 1! people in it manner pos-
sessed by no other {ohm of literature.
and thus it is of immense value.

In discussing “Electra" Miss Millerd
stated that it could not be classed

l among the greatest of the Greek plays

but that it u as typical oi the average
ancient drama. Slle strongly urged
the students to “itness the Cohurn
lllayel's' presentation oi “Electra", has
cause any artistic production oi this
sort cannot help being bath interesting
and instructive.

GGRURN PLAYERS GIVE
GREEK PLAY WELL

“ELECTRA” 0F EURIPIDES
SPLENDIDLY PRESENTED
ON THE CAMPUS.

MRS. GOBUEWUNDERFUL

Makes Ideal Electra—Entire Coha—
pahy Artistic and Effective—
Play Itself Draws Out Many
Conﬂicting Opinions.

Grinneil had lLs ﬁrst opportunity, at
least ior a number oi years, or seeing
Greek drama presented by a protes-
sional company. last night when the
Coburns played the Electra oi Euripi—
dcs on the campus. The outdoor the—
atre was well illled, for the Cohurn:
n'ever iaii to command a crowd when
they come to Grinnell.

No doubt there is wide diversity oi:
opinion concerning the production.
both as to the play and as to the man—
.ner oi its presentation Those who
were disappointed probably tried to
judge Electra by the standards they
have more or less unconsciously iorrn-
cd ior modern plays. The background
or primitive Greek life with its family
pride and loyalty which made it oblig—
atory on the survivors to avenge the
death or any member oi the family.
and the polytheistic religion with its
'contmdlctlons in divine commands, are
strange to the modern nlay-goer. The
structure oi the play is vastly diiier—
ent. There are long declanratory
speeches which giro large quantities or
information. but which at the same
time make it impossible ior tho play—
ers to do nruch acting; hence the play
seems wooden and sluggish. Where
the Greek play gains is in beauty oﬂ
or both lines and of tableau eiiects
The terrible tragedy oi the situation
is also most vividly drewn. and he~
comes many times nror evivid and ter-
rible since the will or the Gods. before
which man is helpless. is made the
vital iacvtor. The whole play cen-
lters about the tragic results of ohelﬁ—
ence to the divine oracle. even when
that obedience is deadly sin.

The argument or the play is prob-
ably familiar to all readers of The
‘Scdl'let and Black. Brieﬂy it is this:
Orestes and Electra murder their nio-
ther. Clytemneslra. and their step
father, Aeglslhus. to avenge the mur-
