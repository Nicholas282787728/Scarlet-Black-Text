Grinnell Five Meets Strong Teams
Throughout Season — Defeat S,
U. I. Twice—Two Games Lost
On Account of slumps.

The outlook (or a winning basket"
ball team was excellent at the begin-
ning of the rear. Four veterans were
still in college and only Captain Mac
EMhl‘on had been lost by graduation.
(With B. I Carney. Hopkins, Slutz, and
Cole as a nucleus ii. Seemed an easy
matter to pick a. team. Compton,
Floken, Swan, Dawlrins and Edgnn
were promlsing substitutes of the (or-
mer Year's team and of the 1914 team.
Sutherland was the must lillell'dooliins
candidate.

The ﬁrst blow to the tell)“ Was the
announcement that Cole must lea .
school. Compton and Ficlien were
tried out for the vacant rot-ward po-
sition. Slutz was reparlod as unable
to play but soon joined the Lealu when
practices commenced. For the vacant
guard position Sutherland and Eagnn
contested. The former was conceded
the better chance or the two but “Red"
showed up in good style as the mac»
rice continued.

lo the ﬁrst game or the season the
team lined up against a strong aggre
gation when they met Firrger‘s Cor-ooh
lians. Although Referee "Stub" stew-
art allowed the game to degenerate
into a roughhouse contest Gl'lllllell won
by getting together in the second halt
and the ﬁeld score was 23 to 15. The
work 01 the Grinch team was err
couraging but the team work needed
improvement. Almost all of the sub-
stitutes got into the contest but the
team that started the game was Hop-l
kins and Ficlron, forwards, Slutz, can
to, and Eagan and Carney, guards.

Coach Brown worked the men hard
lor the next few days and both ganies‘
were won on the trip which soon lol-

and deieated 31 to 13. The score was
close at the end or the ﬁrst half, but“

When the loot began to dawn upon

|Glinnell consciousness that the team

that brought tlle goat from Iowa was
composed entirely of Seniors, a little

,uncertsinty was ielt over next year's

prospects. An intelligent survey of

the University lads.

The new captain and “Diclt’ Tharp
will malie a pair of guards equal to any
in the state. , These two and Comps
ton, at forward, are the only sure hrs
team men. “Comps" has played ste

lar ball whenever his injuries :lllou'ell‘

him to get into the game and the team
r-entel'ing around these there should
be able to work together in great style.

The other candidates for places on
the ﬁrst team are numerous and prom-
ising. A number or guards may be

ancc the team. "Pnlt‘y" Sutherland
may be back in the game next year and

Swan, or lhi l squad, has the
advantage of cxpcrlencc that will stand

Carney Proves Ideal General for
Players This Season — Eagdn
Promises to be Worthy Suc-
cessor.

One or the roost potent [actors in the
development or Grinnell's basketball
has been the captains of her teams.
This )ear Carney proved himself an
ideal leader. A great individual
player, he never lulled to think of the
team ﬁrst and govern his play accord-
ingly. He is a true sportsman and has
the conﬁdence at his men at all times

"Red" Eagan, captain-elect, is a
strong, heady pla; r. wllo has the re
sheet and conﬁdence or all his tealllr
mates, as is evidenced by the lact that
his election was unanimous He is
well ﬁtted to uphold Grinneil's tradi-
tions and great things are expected or
him.

Fl'aln that squad “Red" should be able
to pick a team strong enough to bring
to Grinnell a basketball championshlp

SENIORS ARE EASY VICTORS

Other Three Classes Tie for Sec-
ond Honors.

lntcruclass basketball hns held
prominent place in drinnell's athletic
schedule since the introduction or the
winter sport in the state. The many
victories and championships which the
scar-let and blacl: teams have annexed
during the last row years have been due
to a large extent to the interest
aroused in basketball by the inter-clas
games These contests have nearly
always been close, with at least two
teams having ml equal chance to an.

This Year— Good Materiali-

A good idea or the reasons why,
Grinnell's latest season of hashethan
was so successlul may he gained train
a consideration of the individual men
who made up the team:

BERNARD .7. CARNEY,- '12 (cap;

sons. — "‘Fat” is without a neon
among guards in lowa. He plays
the game for all there is in it
and he gives the best he has always,
Few inrwnrds have beaten him out ilz'
his three seasons of varsity ball, and
usually his iamous leit book has net-
tcd him a rnajo 'ty over his opponent.
Hie leadership this year has been one
or the essential [actors in the success
oi the season, ior not only has he been
an able general, brrt as a player he has

by graduation will be lreenly felt,

several years a star pcriormer in the
