RUSHING BUSINESS.

Although the Scarlet and Black
must confess at the beginning to a
decided inability to handle the sully
jest, certain conditions have grown
up in the girls societies that de-
mand careful attention. In the
ﬁrst place, ll present system
looks unfair to llle nonmembers,
many of whom want and need the
soc‘ ty advaniag s as much as
those who now belong. The soc ty
is the centre of the girls’ social life
and cften, though of course not ale
ways, there is a Cie ep hurt given
to nonmembers The members are
too small a proportion ol the
women of the College.

In the second place, although a
purely literary society would be
shortrlived, the present organiza-
tions seem to fail to give a good
knowledge of procedure; certainly
they should produce secretaries
who can write minutes in correct
forni. It at least seems possible
that a little more attention to this
side of the Work would not be
harmful,

And lastly, there is evidenced
this fall an unhealthful loyalty to
(I s grouping. The girls who

make dates tor the rest of the
year“ and form groups with the
express purpose of “lining-up”
