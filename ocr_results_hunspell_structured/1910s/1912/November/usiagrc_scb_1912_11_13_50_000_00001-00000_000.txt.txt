SERIOUSLY.

DENTERS [TS AENTIDN DN AMES

Declares That Grinnell Hoodoo
Was Buried Four Years Ago.

Expects Big Delegation
for the Battle.

The Druiie Daily Dclphic continues
to make slighting roinai s about the
Gl'innell team. in the issue ror- Tues
day arter explaining that the loss at
the Missouri game rras due to a slump
and a number of inirrries to star lnem-
here or the Drake eleven. the lord oi
the Delphic pencil bcthinhs himselr of
Grinnell in the lollowing style:

“But in the meanwhile the Grinnell
game is not to hc overlooked. The
Congregationalists cannot get over the
idea that they are no longer in Dl'aha's
class and are coming to Des Moines
prepared to give the Bulldogs a hard
right."

In the editorial colrrmu uc read the
tollowiug:

“There is yet another game on our
schedule. We meter to the Allies con-
test, tor Gl'innell is not to be wlisidr
cred. Drake must and will deicat the
Ageies. The ii ssouri that met Drake
was not the Missouri that met Allies
and the disparity in the scores is not
discouraging. We have rron two or our
three Conl'crcuce games virh the
Ames game saiely tuchcd away we will
have as good a claim as any to the dis
outed championship."
