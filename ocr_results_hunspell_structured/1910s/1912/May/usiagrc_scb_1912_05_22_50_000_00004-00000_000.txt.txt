ers at Cedar Falls Saturday hy the
score or s to 3. The ieaLure of the
game was Anderson's worh on the slab.
He was effective in pinches, and al~
lowed only three scattering hits and
struck out eleven men.

Grinnell jumped into the lead in the
ﬁrst inning with two scores to one for
the school lnn'ams and after that they
remained ahead throughout the game.
The ﬁelding ol the Grlnnell team was
rather poor and err :5 gave the home
team lhEir three scores. The Teachers
could not hit. Anderson, but Richalds
who opposed him on the mound was
batted all over the lot. Fichen and
Anderson net-e particularly sutcesstul
with the union and both Cazzens and
Ulicli hit for thra bases. The men
also showed a marked improvement in
base running.
