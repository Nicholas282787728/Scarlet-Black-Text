Takes Good Game from Teachers
at Cedar Falls by Score of 8
to 3—Anderson Pitches Well,

One of the most outrageous satires
on base bnll ever witnessed west of the
Mississippi tool: place on Ward Field
Monday alternoon and was'called in
1he.eighth inning alter Cornell has
chased in 14 runs to the locals 4.
Everything which could be included in
a llook on “How Not. to Play Baseball"
was done as many times as possible
and the Grinnellites displayed by iar
the more fertile inventive minds.
With Cornell clouling the hall at the
terriﬁc price which they were, It is
doubtiul if the locals could have won
had they been playing their best
game, but Cornell could not have won
by any such score at least. Coppess
(a new man at Cornell) and Baird
mauled the sphere terribly, the former
getting a home run, a threebagger and
a two-beggar, while Baird collected
{our singles. The locals were so far
from the earth that they couldn't have
hit the proverbial dock or barns had
they been tossed up, and they failed
miserably Lo do anything to the
straight easy ones which Lott served.

Anderson Replaces Ficken,

The Methodists got to Fiche“ so
unanimously in the ﬁrst tour sessions
that Brown put in Anderson, even
though he was suffering irom a badly
strained arm. Fichen going to second.
He was removed entirely in the sixth.
Anderson pitched good ball consider-
ing his condition but no pitcher could
have done much with the support
which he had.

The htth inning was the most disasr
trons session for the home team, a ser-
ies of double barrelled errors by every
one who could get near enough to the
ball to mutf it produced ﬁve runs i'or
Cornell. This calamity completely
destroyed the pap oi the locals .and
they showed the - utter disregard lor
existence by allowing hlr. Lott to tan
s - of them in a row. Cornell. ho\\~
ever. relustd to be satisfied, and seeing
a good chance to fatten up their bat-
ting averages. crime back in the sixth
and whanged out tour hits which pro
nted three more runs.

Coppess Sensational.

As has been before observed
punishing a certain Coppcss gave that
ball was one of the leotures ot the
exhibition. The big boy was coir
sidernlily pee\etl by the remarks oi Kile
rootei-s alid loan it out most clicctivch

on a bee line and rolled penily to the
gate. Following is the b - score as

Second Game is Planned

The seniors and the iaculty yestei»
day engaged in a bit of sportlve play
on that portion of Ward Field hand
which the grassy vegetation has been
removed. the contest resulting in n
tied score of live to five. Tile game
was wellrexecuted by both parties and
it proved to be intensely Interesting
to the onlookers. The notable features
of the alter-noon's performance were
Proiessor David Feoh's handling of the
wooden slab, Prolessor Joseph G. will
leser’s adeplness in stopping the course
of the transterred sphere, Paul Bar-
rett's sure throwing. Elmer Dnu'kins’
imitation of n in trap. and Claude Mc-
Alpin's able handling of tho spheroid

The play was a trifle too roughly
contested to be altogether sportsman-
like but this was to be expected under
the circumstances. Professor Charles
N. Smiley and David McCreath became
entangled in the northwest corner oi
the plot ironi which the grassy vege
tation had been removed. and Mr. Mc-
Creath was rather unceremoniously
seated on the turf, or thereabouls.
More nngentlemanly conduct was dis
played when Doctor P. E, Somers ad-
vanced to the second station while Ml.
McAlpin was not loohing.

'I‘hc ﬁrst‘inning began’u'ith on un~
rot-innate mishap to Pl-nlcssor Joseph
G. Walloser, who lost his looting and
tell to the ground in a vain endeavor
to catch the sphere struck by the slab
of wood held by Cedric Barnes. No
bones were broken.

The May Day exeicscs, which were
lleltl on the north campus inst Satin»
day alter-noon proved to be one ot the
prettiest events oi the year. The fates
again were kind and gave an ideal day
which added greatly to the beauty or
the scene. A large crowd was assem-
bled before the time for the exercises
to begin and soon ﬁlled the seats which
had been arranged around the dag pole.

The procession.
started at the Rand gymnasium and
alter marching around the campus
halted at the throne beneath the birch
trees where the Queen. Miss Ruth
Davison. was seated with the Maid oi
Honor, blaheldyoodworth. and the
other attendants grouped around her
on the platform. Miss Davison, who
was crowned by Miss Carrie De Haan.
President or the w. A. r... was most
gracious and made a charming picture
beneath the canopy of pink roses.

An innovation oi this year's program
was the Dance of the Seasons which
was pronounced by many the lilost en-
joyable thing on the program. This
dance which was original with Miss
Andersen, show-ed careful training.
The tout-dances given in costume by
the various classes were characteristic
and showed up to much better advan-
tage out of doors than at the gymna-
sium exhibition in the winter. The
winding oi the nlaypole was more
complicated this year than ever he
lore, and was well-executed by the
svteeu Freshman girls. The band
furnished excellent music tliruout the
afternoon ioi- the different dances.
