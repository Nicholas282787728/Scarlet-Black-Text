United States Marine Band, at Opening of the
St. Louis Exposition.

 

ltuly is always regarded as tho homo at music, although Germany with scholarly rigor, has disputed the claim
to [ire-eminence in harmony with its southcriy neighbor. Thc oris n at the U. 5, Marine Band, according to some
history and a great deal or tradition, is ltalian. There is one story to the eiieot that the Marine Band was kidnapped
irom ltaly by a Captain Mc. ll, of the American Irigute Boston. The old sea captain was so delighted by the per
iorinance or some native musicians that he invited them on hoard his ship to play, and by persuasiops not [put
recorded, preventcd them I'rolll going ashore when be weighed anchor. This story is not precisely authentic, as
many of the archives which would show what became or these wandering minstrols alter they reached American shores,
were destroyed in 1314, when the British laid Washington in ashes. not there is no doubt of the Eantl‘s Italian origin,
as the oilicial records show that it was recruited early in the last century with thirteen ltalian musicians, who iormed
the nucleus or what has hccome so great and lamous an organization.
While the Band is Italian in its origin its lcadcr, Licntcnant William H. Santelmann, as his name indicates,
German. He was born in otlensen, Province of Hanover, ot a ianlily whose musical talents constituted an ancestral
trait, He enlisted as a volunteer in the band of the 134th Illl'untry regiment in Lsipsig, and atter three years‘ associa
tion with it, again tool: up the study ot music. He joined a musical organization in Philadelphia. and immediately
became sought attor by Amcrican hand masters and musical directors. His rapid advanccmtut culminated in his selecs
lion as the man qualiﬁed to lead that lamous organization the United Status Marine Band, and his experience and
hnowlcdge have had a vitalizing and rcnniug innuencc on its worlr. It is only during the administration and perhaps
under the example of Presidént Tait that the Marine Band has developed any taste tor travel worth noting.

A special program uill be rendered at Ward Field on Thursday, October 3. Senli‘ster Fee tioktts will admit.
