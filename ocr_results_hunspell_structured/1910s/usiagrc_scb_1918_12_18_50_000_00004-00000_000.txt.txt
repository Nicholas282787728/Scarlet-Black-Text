- room on Sunday- evening.

Ruth Wilson, president of the Y. W.
C. A" briefly told of the meaning of
the Yule Log service to the college
girls.

The lighting of the ﬁre by a piece
oi cllztl'l'ed wood from the log burned
in the preceding year symbolizes the
ideals that have been held by the {or-

nici‘ girls of Grihnell.

After the lighting_ of the ﬁre sevei a1
piano selections u eie given by Mrs
C. N. ~Siniley.

Prolcssor Lavell in tracing the his-
tory of the Yule Log service impressed

. the importance of the burning of the .
evils of the year passed, with the burnr

mg of the log and when burned, to
make newer and higher ideals to re-
place Lhcmi He urged that in our
present busy life, a new spirit of

Christmas and the Spirit held by the ;
ancient Yule Log serv-ice‘ be hint to -

us,
The seivicc was concluded with the

singing of “Silent Night" and the read— =

in; of the Christmas story.
