THE ii SPER CONCERT.
Many opportunities are oifered Gr r

slc that is ofiereol here is ver often

The first Annual Vesper Concert was
an nnnuamcd success in spite oi the
small attendance. With the memory
or such music as was offered last er-
ening the Second Annual Vesper Cons
ceit will he on event loolted forward
to.
THE TRIANGULAR am T.
The renewal of the custom oi several
years ago where Anies, Dralre and
Grinneil met in one ﬁeld and trselr cott-
test is certainly to he commended. The
meet in Ames the 14th oi May is one
well ‘worth the best eftorts ot e\‘el'\'
Griniieli man uho is interested in the
success oi the college in those sports.

reason the article slioiiid lie ol very
great interest to all in Grinnell who
are interested in the college either
from the standpoint of the present or
the future.

in just one respect these articles
have failed to touch upon one or the
most important phi.es or student life
namely the college home life. Except-
lug tor an occasional i-cieronce to the
1raternity, the dormitory and one or
two cluh houses this very vital phase
of student life has not been touched
upon. This in itself is a coniiiteiit
upon the entire lack of adequate pro»
vi ion for this side ot student lite on
the part of the entire educational sys.
tem in America.

The comment on intercollegiate ath.
lctics and some phases oi class room
instruction are certainly suggestive
of possible moans of improvement.

JAQUA WRITES [1N FOOTBALL SAME.

(Continued (rum ﬁrst page.)
Football is not play, iii most cases it is
anything hut play. it is not. even good
recreation because it is too gruelling
and requires [00 intit-li srindiig trad
tice when the nLIjOYI . at men need a
dil'ieretit kind or store ‘0. Football
[I‘Lkes too much time. ll. too danger
on in its piesent i‘oim, tho this is not
an nbsolnlrly cour argument
against it. it is not at some men enjoy
playing lint above all it has failed
to ittsti . ' continuance on the
ground that it is no longer a i'ecl'ezr
tioti, it is a stunt college bllslul’h’s.
What shall he done about it? Every
one recognizes that tirintioll would
make a mistalte ii it i‘uiled to turnish
nniple opportunitv [or games on the
athletic ﬁeld. We need to eel' in the
direction of too many games rather
than too l'ew. Every year my beliei iii
athletics is strengthened. But i am
convinced now that loothall should be
wiped oil the slate and another game
or games substituted in its place. Try
several and from the best pick an inter--
collegiate game, it intercollegiate
games are iieoessai_.

Experience has shown that it is im-
possible to reform iootbail liy changing
the rules, in loot, Lhe tendency now is
to go bath to the old rules. if I thought
ioothall could be reformed by changing
the rules l would he iit taror of keep
in; it, hut it can‘t ho. done. We are
putting the enlnlnlsls on the average
place. The ' to istortn i‘oothall is
to abolish it . t pt . tit l\\‘0 shines
