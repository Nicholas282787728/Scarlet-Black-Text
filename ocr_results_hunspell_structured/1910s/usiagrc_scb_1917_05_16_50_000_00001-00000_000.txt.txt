RESULTS OF DUALS WITH DRAKE
GIVE IOWA STATE A POS-
SIBLE ADVANTAGE.

tint ls inﬁll III RELAY

Barriers ’l‘lll‘oull Down in Relays lint]
Coe lulll Cornell Will Be Allowed
to Run With “Big Four"
for First Time.

Dupe on the state meet to be held
next Saturday at Drake indicates that
Grinnell and Ames are going to light
for supremacy with only a. margin of

a few points between them. The re.

spective duals which Drake has held
with the above schools this year fur-
nish the only means by which the meet
can he forecasted.

Grinnell defeated Drake by only
about twenty points, While the Aggies
had a margin of eighty. Nevertheless
the recruits from Drake to Fort Snell-
lng between the times of the duals
can be counted for something in com—
paring scores. This unsettled condi—
tion has not adected the two state
schools as much and they can be de
pended on for about the same points
as if the unsettled conditions had not
occurred.

Announcement was made yesterday
by the state committee that on account
or "the unsettled conditions" the bar-
riers will be thrown down and Coe
and Cornell will he allowed to enter
the relays along with the Big Four
of the state. This has never been
done before‘ because it necessitates the
much crowding on the track.

Preliminaries in the 100 yard, 220
yard, 440 yard dashes and both
hurdles will be run of! Friday after-
noon at 4 o'clock. To have any chance
at the meet it seems necessary that
a clean sweep will have to be made in
all these events, as well as winning
both relays, which is very improb-
able. Whether or not Hoyt will enter
either hurdle race is a matter of much
speculation at present.

The. lack of any entry in the ﬁeld
events will he tell keenly by the Scar—

.let and Black team. Pottle, who has
picked several points in the jumps this
year, has left school for the year, and
Boehmler, the midget polervallltel', is
not eligible for state competition. The
call of the farm has taken Smith, Mar-
tin and Augustine from the team, all
0: whom could be counted on for tak»
ing sure points in the weights.

The new event for this year, hurling
the iavelln, will not have any entry
trom Grinnell either. John Miller. the
broad jumper, who was expected to
throw “the stick" as tar as any of
them, has gone to join the aviation
corps. Those losses will necessitate
the piling up of a large number of
points in all the races if it is possible
for Grinnell to break even.

The team will leave Friday morning
tor Des Moines on account of the
above mentioned prciiminaries. The
men who will make the trip are: Capt.
Hoyt. Bar-den. Fleming, narrow, Fleck,
Van Dorn, F. Miller, A. Miller, . vac
Gregor, J. p. MacGregor, Sprinkle and
Parsons.

Besides this there is expected to he
a delegation of about three hundred
students that will go down from here.
Tickets were i-eccivtl by Doc Huff last
evening and can be gotten at the once
any time beiore Saturday.

BASEBALL TEAM GDES TD
WAR-GAMES DANDELLED

Schedule Is Cilllell Off Because All
Vlll'sity Men But. One Have Gone
—N0 Action Taken In Regard
to Football.

Owing to the fact that every base-
ball man in Grinnell, with the excel»
tion or one, has entered one or an-
other branch of the national service.
the baseball schedule has been cau-
celed, according to a statement made
by H. J. Huﬂ, director of athletics,
yesterday afternoon. >

Only a short schedule was listed for
this season after baseball had been
abolished on account of lack of inter-
est and revived on trial after much
agitation on the part of students to
have it reinstated.

The news that Coach Solom had
gone to Fort shelling and so in all
probability will not be back next your
has ﬁlled the air with rumors that the
same action had taken place in re-
gard to football. However, no action
has been taken, and a sentiment
seems to live among the students for
the gridiron game to he continued as
long as eleven men can be persuaded
to go out and a schedule be kept up.

Those Under Conscription Age
7A1] Should Drill.

“The government does not want
men under the age of twenty-one to
enlist,” said President Main, Monday
after-noon, in reiteration of the state-
ment made at chapel Monday morn-
ing. Telegrams from the educational
commission and Secretary of War
Baker were seen by the president
when in Iowa City Satlll'dlly. These
telegrams were in the hands of Cep-
tain Mumma and were to the effect
that the best service that can be rem
ﬂawed by these young men is to remain
in college or on the farm or what-
ever Work they are in.

“There is no doubt that a nation-
wide propaganda will be started soon
to prevent the enlistment of the
younger men, and it will he conducted
by men who are leaders in the move-
ment to prepare the country for the
war as soon as possible."

Men under conscription age are not
wanted for military service or they
would have been included in the bill.
is the opinion of Dr. am. “The best
way to serve is to continue with the
college work and take the military
drill offered. At this tune the empha-
sis should be placed on military drill
instead of enlistment. Every man in
Gl'inuell should be drilling regularly,"
was his statement.

HOLD POSSUM HUNT ON

Sunday aftcrnoou saw a, revival on
the college campus of fl. sport which
must havc been popular there ﬁfty
years ago, 'possum hunting. Two spe-

the big maples on the south campus.
One was easily captured, but the other
retreated to the topmost twig of the
highest limb . It was only after cone
sidel'ahle difﬁculty that he was ﬁnally
dislodged and made a spectacular drop
into a waiting blanket.

more state records than any other

with three each. Besides this, the

"Chuck" Hoyt set the new record in

From the results of the conference
