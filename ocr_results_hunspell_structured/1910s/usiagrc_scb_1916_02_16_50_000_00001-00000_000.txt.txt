PARKER OUT OF TWO
OIASHES THIS WEEK

CONDITION TO KEEP NEW
FORWARD FROM DRAKE
AND SIMPSON.

illi GlMisEi Tl] SOME

Goe Will Invade Local Camp Week
From Yesterday—Hawkeyc
Mix Is Saturday

Full on. ill

With Parker out ot both games be
cause af scholastic difﬁculties, the
Grinnell five takes the last trip of the
season this \\'cek-entl to lndianola and
Des hioines, where Coach Carney hopes
to carry oli two victories when his
men clash u ith the Simpson and Drake
nuintets. The battle against the meth-
odists comes Friday night, and that
with the Bulldogs Saturday alternoon.

Cue Here Next Tuesday.

Following this tuo-gaiue journey,
the Scarlet stluad returns to Grinncll
with only a two-day rest before the
mix uith Coe on IV'aslllngtnn‘s hit-th-
day, the aitcrnoon of nevt Tlleslla).
This contest tvill he the deciding l.
tor in the ‘Ccnlerencc title race and
may be oi importance in the state
standings, should the local tosscrs re-
turn from Des Moines in a condition
preventing a good showing against the
Cedar Rapids invaders, Pa or will
probably he hack in the lineup ior this
scrap, lion-ct er. which boosts Grin
nell's chances.

The last game ol the season of real
importance will he the return
with lowa, lour days after Coe plays on
the local iloor, in what promises to he
the most important clash ol the sea
son in its hearing on team smndinge.
Considering that Grinnell wins the
Conference game earlier in the week,
the lowa game will either give the
Hawkeyes an undisputed title or ttiil
unavoidably tangle the iinal rankings.
The Ameslowa clash next Saturday
may give the situation even another
turn should the Cyclones win.

Drake Will Gite )iitrd llhttle.

As far as the games of the local live

this week are concerned, the Bulldog

encounter looks the more formidallle.,

Coach Whistman's tossers gave the
Aggies a hard tussle last week, and
will probably be primed tor the Grin-
nellians. Simpson will also give more
trouble than they showed here, al-
though Carney will probably use suh-
stitutes to advanmge.

Drake will close the season for the
local squad in a return game here
March 3. a week before the high school
basketball tournament it has proved
impossihle to schedule a game with
Cornell, as rumored.
