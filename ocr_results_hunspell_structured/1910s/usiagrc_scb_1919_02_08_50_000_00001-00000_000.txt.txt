A recent letter from Prof. John iii,

has been in service in France since
the spring of 1317,

France since the beginning of the war
He mentions incidentally sever-n

changes in the language which the'

war has brought about. His letter
follows:

“The date of our departure for
America is, as yet, uncertain. We re-
ceive from time to time, various

“lily-ans", none or which have proved

themselves official, so We are waiting,

and hoping.

“I have just returned from France's

“What a change even within a, year!
I saw it in December, 1917. It was
then quite shattered, but there were
still civilians With sin in; faces to
be seen upon the streets; shops still
tempted one with their display of ap-
petizing ‘discuits de Rheirns', and the
market—place was as animated as in
many towns in the rear. I came intu

from Rethel, through the Old lines. TD

The first annual ”Grinuell Day" was
celebrated in Grinnell by a special
chapel service, lunclioons and an open
housc at the men's dormitories and
the Women's quadrangle.

The special chapel sen’icc was up—
ened by Prof. Charles Noble, Who
spoke of Griuucll Day as an occasion
to be celebrated by students and
alumni wherever they should be.

Miss Ruth Wilson as the ﬁrst
sneaker on the program gave a wei-
come to the men returned from the
service. Hcr talk was opened by a
cordial welcome on behalf of the col»
logo to the men who have received
their discharges and have again taken
up their studios in Grinnell. She stat-
ed that it is now the duty or the
students or the college to carry out
the principles in peace for which the
allied nations have fought.
Grant Oppomuiity Offered.

“Grinncll cites a great opportunity
to its students in the channels of re-
construction. Let us translate the
discipline of war into voluntary co—
operation here in Gi‘innell,“ said Miss
Wilson. In conclusion she stated that
Grinhell Day should not only be con—
sidered as a day or celebration but also
as a day of great achievement.

Walter Meek who has recently re<
tinned from the service, responded to
ithe welcome. He said that the men
returned to crinuell as a matter or
icourse, hu- thoy would not think of go-
ing anywhere c “oiu- experiences
