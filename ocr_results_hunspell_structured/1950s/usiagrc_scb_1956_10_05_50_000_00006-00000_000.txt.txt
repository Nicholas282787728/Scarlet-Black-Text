Vo+ers Gel- Absentee Ballots
Afl'er Regis+ering Al' Home

by Bob Barr
On Nov. 6, the people of this country will elect the

President of the United States, 435 oong~
tors, and innumerable state and local offl

smen, 34 sena-
alsl If you are

now at least 21 years old or_will be 21 by Nov. 6, you are
eligible to vote in this election, even though you may .be
many miles from home on election day, through the devrce

of the absentee ballot. _

There are two steps to voting
by absentee ballot. First of all,
you must be registered. If you
live in Illinois, you must regis-
ter in person before Oct. 8, If
you have not registered yet, you
are out of luck unless you want
to take a quick trip home.

If you live in Iowa, things
are a little bit easier. In many
places, you don‘t have to
register at all —- the afﬁdavit
on your absentee ballot ei-
iccts your registration. now-
ever, if you live in a city with
a population or over 10,000,
you must register. If you have
not yet registered, you may
do so either in person or by
mail any time through Oct.
27. To register by mail, re-
quest duplicate registration
carols from your city clerk
(commissioner of registration
in Des Moines).

Assuming that you are pro-
perly registered, the next step
is securing your absentee bal-
lot. in Illinois, you can write
for an official application any
time after Oct. 3. If you live
in Chicago, Berwyn, Chicago
Heights, Cicero, Elmwood Park,
Harvey, Lyons, Morton Grove,
Skokie, Stickney, or Summit,
you are in the Chicago election
district and your request for
an absentee ballot should be
addressed to the Board of Eleca
tion Commissioners, Chicago. Ill.
it you live elsewhere in Cook
County (except Evanston) ada
dress your request to: County
Clerk’s Office, Room 230

Capital Commentary
Cont. from p. 2

etc, in an election year?)

On the 30th of September,
one of your writers attended
the All Soul’s Unitarian church
here and was thrilled to a con.‘
siderable extent to find himself
sitting directly in front of Adlai
Stevenson and his son. He took
the opportunity to renew an old
acquaintance with the governor
and to introduce him to Anne
Hruska, another Grinncllian-in—
Washington. It was in a way
embarrassing, as Anne‘s uncle
is the senior senator from Ne-
braska (home of the original
Joe Smith), and is on the GOP
“truth squad” trailing Adlai
about the country and question-
‘ing his statements.

Without undue waving of
the flag, it gives one pause to
reﬂect on the eminent advan-
tages of a political system
which allows a crude colleg-
iate to worship next to the
Outstanding Contender for
President of the United States,
all without protocol or elab-
orate arrangement.

r r. t

It has been said that the
American people get the gov-
ernment they deserve, but this
year we have a feeling that no
matter What the outcome, they
will get more, ,

STICKLERS ARE TICKLERS and a mighty soft way to make money!

Just write down a simple riddle and a twosword rhyming answer. For
example: What’s a ball player who gets a raise'.7 (Answer: richer

pitcher.) Note: both words must have the same number of syllables
—bleak freak, jolly dolly, vinery ﬁnery. Send your Sticklers, with
your name, address, college, and class, to Happy-Joe-Lucky, Box
67A, Mt. Vernon, N. Y. Don’t do drawings! We'll pay $25 for every
Stickler we use in our advertising~and for hundreds that never see
print. And remember—you’re bound to Stickle better when you’re
enjoyinga Lucky, because Luckies taste better. Luckies’ mild, good-
tasting tobacco is TOASTED to taste even better. Fact is, you’ll say
Luckies are the best-tasting cigarette you ever smoked!
