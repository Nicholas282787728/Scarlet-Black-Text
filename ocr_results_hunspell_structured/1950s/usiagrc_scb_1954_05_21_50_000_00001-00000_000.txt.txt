student Council President Kitten Arveson said yesterday that
“there IS a possibility of things being worked out to the point
where We can have effective student government" She said that
the administration and the students were both willing to work
toward a_compromisc without the sacrifice by the students of any
of the principles on which the new constitution was based.

. She made the statement after a meeting yesterday afternoon
with President Samuel N. Stevens, and Dean of the College
Homer Norton, Dean of Women Evelyn Gardner, and Dean of
Men Henry A. Brown

, In_ an interview yesterday with the S&B, President Stevens
said his memorandum, which brought charges of aboutrface from
students working for the constitution, had been misinterpreted.

Kitten later told the 5&3 that in her meeting President Stev-
ens had made substantially the same explanation.

In regard to the grant of power which had been described as
an unknown quantity, he said his purpose had been to not limit
the powers of the executive council, rather than to give it only
token authority.

“I recognized the formation of all those ommittees (the com»
mittees formed by the constitution to administer the social nd
semestergfees“ the publications and radio station, social activ ies,
and student organizations and clubs) in the memorandum," Pres-
ident Stevens said. “I can’t instrument that approval except under
negotiations with the groups holding power now," he continued.

there would probably be a.
meeting of the student consti—i,
tution committee at Grinnelll
during the summer, at which;
arrangements to complete ns
goti‘ations for a shift of responsi—
bility would he made.

President Stevens said he
“expected" that the commit.
tee established under the pro-
posed constitution would be
able to assume their duties by
“the end of the first semes-
ter next year,”

Regarding the second criti-

the
Board and the c of HP froml
the executive council, requiring
only reports of policies and ac-
tions would not significantly a1—
’ter student government from
the way it is now, President
lStevens said that full subser-
vience of the men's and we-
men’s governing bodies was an
“impossible ideal,” and that he
had proposed the annual report
and joint meeting as a partial
step forward to complete co—
operation and trust between the
two one-campus groups and the
executive council.

He said that the “over-
whelming majority" of League
Board and C of HP members,
as well as Deans Gardner and i
Brawn, opposed the constitu-
tion’s provision requiring ap.
proval or all policies by the
executive Council.

He said in regard to the sep-
aration of the judiciary from the
other branches of government,
and with the expansion of stu-
dent judicial power, that the
only thing he feared was that
students would be too harsh on
offenders.

Members of the administra-

separation of the Leaguel

during trials, he said, as “friends
of the court” to temper the de-
cisions of the student judicial
boards. He noted the criticism
of the ”secrecy oath” at judicial
proceedings, and said he had
not considered the possibility of.
“star chamber” courts.
