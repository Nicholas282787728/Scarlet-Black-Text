What’ll You Have? '

Since the proposals for reol‘ganiiation of student gov-
ernment have found firm opposition from the two politi-
cally strongest groups in campus affairs, little headway
will be made in the next few weeks; and it‘s time to do as

' Annie Oakley says 7 “take stock of what we have __ and
what we haven’t. What do we find?"

We' have got three basic governmental groups, all
complete within themselves, all operating by themselves.
We have got student apathy; what interest there is in
student government is disorganized and sporadic. It seldom
travels out of private gripe sessions onto the floor of a
capable student agency, most probably because it doesn’t
know ‘where to go. We have got two major student—faculty
committees, who handle (either first or second-hand) our
social and extracurricular activities, frOm drawing up ,a
social calendar and chartering clubs to appropriating social
fees and semester fees.

We haven’t got order. We haven’t got a student
government that is easily understood by most students
And we haven’t got a student government which holds
the confidence of the student body, or the ten-to-one vote
in favor of the general idea of coordination and unifica-
‘tion would never have occurred last year.

, We have three alternatives from which to choose We
can change the form and content of student government
on the Grinnell campus now; and attempt to mold one
which is better, both educationally and politically. We can
keep plugging along with the system we now have, and
fall back on that familiar refrain # “Do it tomorrow.”

’ Or we can put student government into a shiny aluminum
box and mail it to President Stevens, attaching a card say-
ing “To hell with it‘making our own decisions interferes
with our social and academic lives.”

of the three, the second is undoubtedly the easiest to
accomplish, but the first is the one which ought to be done.
If student government is to grow, and foster a better
relationship between groups on the Grinnell campus, it
will have to become much more than it is at present.

It appears that because of the stiff opposition, the
present proposals for change will have little, if any, chance
for success. But from the controversy about them, we may
be able to find a basis for change on which we can all

agree. ,

The best quality of the proposed plan is the one in
which a separation of powers is suggested. A central, uni-
fied legislative body, with the power to make all rules
within the defined area of student government is impera»
tive to the establishment of good Grinnell student govern,

ment.

Gripes would have one place to go, and one place
only. Power to enact laws would be placed in one spot,
Where even the most unaware student couldn’t help but
note the impact of student government on his campus
activities. And the responsibility placed upon the students
in this body, and in turn on the students who elect
and advise them, would result in a more responsible

graduate.

Of course, given a legislative body, campus government}
would require an executive, or two executives if the stu-
dents wished, to aid in the enactment of laws and to enforce.
them. ; ”ﬁg.

A judiciary is also called for under this concept of
government; and to fit this role, Student Council President‘
Roger Perry’s proposal last year of an “allvcollege council” ,
or ”honor court,” supported by both the League Board and
the C of HP, would fill the bill.

The details may vary as the majority of the student‘
body wishes, but these general concepts should not be lost,
if student‘ government is to mean more than it does at

, present.
