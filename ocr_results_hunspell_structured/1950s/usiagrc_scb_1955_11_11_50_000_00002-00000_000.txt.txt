The Light

l The Scarlet and Black would like to add its note of
praise for the mail that will be inaugurated Sunday. in
this year’s first editorial we predicted that President Bowen
would bring a new light to Grinnell. In the few months
that he has been with us this new light has manifested
itself ill the things which Mr. Bowen as done.

This beacon will probably lend even l'urtllerl The idea
of a roundtable discussion ill order to bring the students
and himself into a closer relationship bears out our fore-
cast. True, a president must do many things which never
bring him near the students. Yet we find that he is interest
ed and willing to try to solve campus problems, The 8&3
wishes, Dr. Bowen, that your years here will be profitable,
not only for yourself, but the students as well,

Because today is Armistice Day our publishers were
closed and the Scarlet and Black was forced to put out two
papers last Friday, holding one until today when we felt
it more profitable to release.

SCARLET AND BLACK

The Sound

and

The Fury

By Art Travers

The revival of literature on
campus has been most interest-
ing. It presmis cerlain prob-
lems, however. There is a cry-
ing need for some sort of ex-
planation of the symbolism in
poetry. Let us take as our ex
ample a great poem by the no 7
able author Anon, “Little Jack
Homer”.

There seems little doubt that
the poet has projected himself
into the clue character ol the
poem. In fact the poet is laying
bore his very soul right in front
ol us. A pretty exhibitionism
move.

in the xii-st line the author
states his icclmg about man's
place in thc overall scheme 0(
things. "thtle Jack Horner sat
in the corner . . is clearly
an indication that the suihor
is quite moved by the relative
unimportance of the human be-
ing in the universe. “The car—
nor" is a symool of frustration.
The bard s frustrated by his
inability to elevate himself.

The next line “. , Eating a
Christmas pio prosenls
the image or religion in mans
life. Religion (symbolized by
the Christmas pic) nourishes
the mortal and immortal parts
of man. (Man cannot live by
bread alone)

"He put in his thumb . . .
symbolizes sensuality. The worst
kind. Man is always putting
his thumb into things and spoil~
inc them, (It makes the thumb
p tty sticky too) The poet has
taken a Vicious swipc at the
pleasures of the ilcsh in this
line.

. And Pulled out a plum
. . Oh what irony is here dis
played. Ever tried to pull a plum
out of a Christmas pm? You
can’t do it unless you stick
your thumb right into lhe plum
and that splits the plum. Thus
we see the poet is castigating
man lor l . hollow materialism.
The plum .s a double image.
n represents man's material goal
and also represents the soul
which he Splits or ruins in the
process of achieving this goal.
n . . . And said, ‘what n good
boy am l‘!" in lhls line the au-
thor pictures the bitter humor
of man. Man feels he has ac-
complished something and crows
about it, but picture man, sits
ting in a corner with soul im-
palcd upon his own thumb.
What a heart-rending display.
Poetry is easy to understand
if you will not let yourself be»

upon us and the students get
themselves another dance for
this semeslcr. The important
thing is not the actual event
but what it means for the
Grinnell students, In Dr. Bowen
and Dean Grace, we have two
men wllh‘ ilicir feet on the
ground and their eyes trained
on the future, Grlnnell cannot
help but go forward with these
men. The veterans on the ad-
ministration are giving them
the whale hearted support
which is distinctive of people
long schooled in Grlnnell tradi-
tion. The school has already
d6 several great strides. More
in store.

I'd like to join with the edir
tor in extending the right hand
of congratulations and friend—
ship to these men who have al-
ready shown themselves to be
friends of the students.
