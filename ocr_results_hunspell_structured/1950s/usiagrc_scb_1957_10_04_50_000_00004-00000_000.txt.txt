Booth PhD Research Reveals Persbhalily Ratings;
Compares Trails 0f Athletes And NonaAlhleIes

By Gene Thompson

Do competitive sports ill college really develop the traditional agl'essiveness, lead-
ership ability, and self~confidence that are said to be the personality traits of the athlete?
Do athletic programs effect desirable changes in personality for the athlete participat-
ing? What kind of personality makes a “good” and a “poor” athlete?

The- answers to these questions"dealing with the athlete is an individual may be

in sight. '

Some of them have already
been answered in a study made
by Grinnell's coach E G. Booth.
Booth, who was on leave of
absence. last year, worked on

i’thc study here‘ at Grinnell and

at the State University or lowa,
and has received a doctorate as

ii result of this work, s

Use m1 Test

Employing a sooeitem lest
known as the Minnesota Multi-‘
phasic Personality lnventorv
(M‘MPI) Booth compared the
personality ratings of seventy-
onc ircshman non—athletes, sixty-
thrcc lrcshman athletes, seven-
tyrfour npperclassman none
athletes, sixtyrthree -Il'eshman
athletes, seventy-four upper-
classman non-athletcs, and
seventy—eight varsity athletes.
Only male students wcrc test-
ed.

Thc first part of the study
involves an analysis of variance
and a comparison between ath-
lctes and non—athletes in the two
class groups. ‘ ~

0n the‘ “masculine-feminine
interest variable" non-athletes
scored significantly ,higher
than athletes. Froml this it
,may be interred that the atti-
tudes oi athletesare“typica.lly
masculine” as regards interests

and activities. ,

0n the “anxlety scale." vars-
itv athletes scored significantly
lower than freshman non-ath-
letes and uppercassman non-
atbletes. This is an indication of
“a lower level of internal anx-
iety" for the athlete. He is ”less
anxrous," exhibits less “emotion-
ality.” _

Upperclass Dominance

When analyzed on the “dome
lnance scale" it Mas found that
varsity athletes and upperclass-
man nonrathletes ranked signifa

 

icantly higher than freshmen
and fleshman nonrathletes, The
results indicate that class standr
ing promotes this f‘dominancc,"
which was defined as the ability
to influence others, gain re—
spect and- exen control over
other. The “duminanl” indie
vldual‘gains security and self-
assurance. ’

On the “social responsibility
scale," “PFQI’CL’JSSIJ’IZJ‘ nonr
athletes rated significantly
higher than the other three
groups, The “social responsi—
bility scalemindicates a ready
willingness to accept the con-
sequencw oi his own behavior
and a Sense of obligation to
the group.
in a comparison within-the
freshman group alone, no dif-

ference in variables existed as
regards pa icipation in team
sports, parti nation in individ
ual sports, or participation in
bath team and individual sports.
But ”on the varsity level, 'it was
found that athletes who partici-
pate in only individual sports
scored higher on the ”depres»
sion variable," which suggests a
"lack of selfrcontrol, tendency
to worry, and a narrowncss of
interests" These athletes also
rated higher on the “psych0r
tllomla variable," which indi-
dicfltes a tendency toward “mild
depression. a lack of confidence,
an inability to concentrate, and
the presence of unreasonable
fears." ,

No Positive Test Yet

Outside the limits of the
study, Booth investigated the
traits of “good" and “poor” ath-
letes. Freshman and varsity atll—
letcs wcrc rated as “good’ or
“poor” by their teammates and
by their coach. Using the top
25 percent of the “good” athr
letcs, and the lower 25 per

cent of the ”pnnr" athletes, the
answers to the 550 items of the
MMPl,were compared Booth
found 22 items that showed a
significant difference between
personality traits of “good" and
“poor” athletes, These 22 items
were then submitted to 21 mem-
bers of the SUI track team,

_who had been rated as “good”

or “poor" by their coach, Booth

,found a positive correlation of

.63, a high correlation for this
kind of a test. ‘

Booth cautioned that there is
as yet no positive test which
will predict the success of a
would—be athlete. He cited the
vast possibilities.“ such attest,
but emphasized the fact’ that
there is still a great area left
open for study.

Booth hopes to be able W
accomplish some of this study.
Speaking of “competitive be—
havior," he cited the mar-
ence between “competitive
spirit (pure enthusiasm, the
desire to playand win) and
“competitive pol-romance,” the
ratio of actual performance
and “competitive spirit." For
example, an athlete like Ted
Williams is usually able to
“come through in the pinch,"
that is, he has a. good com-
petitive perlornlancc. But he
is considered to have a poor
competitive, spirit. In high
school and ‘ college, camped-
tive spirit often consists of a
desire to wear the letter—
swellter -or just “be on the
team," and performance is
lacking.

Booth considers the field as
undeveloped. “I’m interested,"
he says, “in the cause-effect
relationship between participants
and non—participants _ perhaps
in the future we can develop a
complete and valid scale."
