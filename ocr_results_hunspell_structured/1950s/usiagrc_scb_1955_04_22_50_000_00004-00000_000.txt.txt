Council Asks Aid
To New Freshmen
By Upperclassmen

“There is general agreement
among the counselling staff and
student leaders that some ill.-
temlpt should ‘be made in the fu-
ture to utilize ulpperclass studr
exits to help incoming freshmen
on a larger scale than is now
being done." stated George I’l.
Lov‘ell, director of the colleges
counselling program, in an inn
lei-View yesterday.

“This is the general purpose
ol‘ the rewntlyrprnposed spon-
sor system," he explained.
“Specifically, this plan hopes
to do two things: First. help
new students learn to study,
since st) many freshmen com»
lnent that they did not knew
how to proceed with good
study habits when they first
came to college. And second,
encourage them to appmnch
college as an institution of
learning and to take advant—
age of the many abademiu and
social activities, which in-
volves learning how to budget
one’s time."

Student Council presidentKen
Kasse‘baum stated Tuesday that
“in the sense that this prograli’n
is another step by students in
the running of the college com-
munity it is a Step toward more
student govern hi. it we want
more respons‘i ty, here's the
place to lbegin."

In addition, he explained sev—
eral other items pertaining to
the program. Although funda—
mentally the same plan will he
