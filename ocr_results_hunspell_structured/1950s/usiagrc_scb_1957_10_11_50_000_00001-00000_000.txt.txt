Under the leadership ot the
League Board and the c of HP,
the respective campuses have
answered the problem of Home.
coming displays in different
ways. The problem arose be-
cause of the two-day lag be-
tween the beginning of Convo-
cation and the Homecoming

cation activities.

Following the opinions ex~
pressed in a straw vote of the
women taken in a mass meet-
ing last Friday, the League
Board is planning to construct
a tloat to bear the Homecoming
queen and the platform which
will be used during the hall-
time activities. Construction of
the platform will be a project
tor the preps, while the ﬂoat
itself will be constructed by all
women of the Quad.

On north campus, a vote was
taken in each hall, determining
whether that house wished to
construct a display. Five halls
voted in favor of displays, tour
were opposed. Subsequently, the
c of HP has decided to con-
duct inter-hall competition. it
is not known whether any of
the halls originally opposed will
enter the competition.

‘Fling' To Replace
Quad Open House

Because of the current
epidemic, which has incapaci-
tated approximately onerfifth
of the campus population
(225 students) in the last
two weeks, the Quad open
house. originally scheduled to be
held tomorrow night, has been
postponed.

Of the activities planned for
the evening, the hall open
houses and variety show, “In the
Limelight,” have been delayed.
There will, however, be a dance
in the Women's gym at 9, in-
stead of in Main lounge at 9:30,
as was originally planned. The
dance is to be entitled, "The
Flu Fling." The rest of the pro-
gram is tentatively scheduled to
be held next Friday.

Bob Curveyi who is to co-
emcee the variety Show With
Jackie Muhl, reports that, of the
original program of ten acts,

' two acts would definitely have

been unable to perform, two
more were potentially unable,
and serious rehearsal problems
have occurred among those re-
covered.

An approximate estimate by
the dean of women and the dean
of men places the number of stu-
dents who have contracted the
flu at 150 women and 75 men.
For this reason, the hall open
houses, especially in such halls
as Halnes, which is heavily
stricken, would have contribut-
ed greatly to the spread of the
malady. ’
