Personnel Chdi

rrnan Spies?

Andy Drummond Says 'NO!'

By Jack Skog

"No, I certainly wouldn’t say
that the counseling organization
is a spy system,” said Andy
Drummond, Rawson's personnel
chairman,

“Well,” says I, “we all know
that the halls on campus have
representatives to some kind of
counseling deal and frein what
I‘ve heard it’s a big spy sys
tem."

“I’d hardly call it that
though” Andy says. “so 1 guess
the first -thing i should do is
tell you what our purpose is."

“In general we~try to help
the fellows and girls in our
halls. in adjusting to college
life, in particular that means
we try to help the kids with
their grade problems and any
social or emationalrproblems
they might have."

“You mean like a psychia—
tl'ist," says I.

“Well, not anything as dras—

itic as that, but Working as a
igrmlp we discuss campus prob.
lems, without names of course,
and Hi general try to_ help the
students who may be having
trouble, particularly academic
,tl'mlble,
, If we think anyone needs
.special help we may refer him
ito Dr. Lovell or either of the
Deans and through our reports
an the students they try to
1help the individual with his
problems,

We also try to make Candi»
‘tions in the halls favorable to
study through the use of quiet
,hours and in some cases fines
and Calnpuslng for violation or
,these hours.”

With a changed opinion of
ithe Grinnell counseling system
,and a fear of quiet hour vio»
ilations l tiptoed out of Andy's
irooin and down to mine to
lwrite a story for the 5&3.

”We Need Training
For Paren+hood.'
Claims Thompson

“Democratic parenthood is
characterized by considerateness
and responsiveness," asserted
Mr. Max Thompson, psychology
instructor in his chapel talk
yesterday.

“The capable parent," he went
on, “must. understand his child
as a unique, individual human
being, We teach children to re
spect adults but we do not
teach parents to respect the in
dividuality of the child.”

Mr. Thompson stressed the
fact that the ideal family is a
democracy, not an autocracy.
The’parents who use their chile
dren as a device to salvage a
broken marriage or to gratify
seine of their own frustrated
ambitions are being autocratic
and selfish. They must consider
the child’s uniqueness as an in-
dividual and not as a means to
an end, -

“Parenthood," he stated, ”is
one of the most important func-
tions of a mature person. Our
society, however, does very
little to prepare young people
for this major role. The atti—
tude today seems to be that.
niarriage is the only prepara—
tion needed for this significant
responsibility."
