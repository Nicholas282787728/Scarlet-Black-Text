A Changer” the Quad

A chief Gi‘inncll complaint is "sameness,” Tlle food’s
t-‘le same, the Social schedule's tlle same, the courses are
t. same, the bottlenecks and inconveniences are the same
it in year to year, so we hear.

Once in a while a new idea peeps shyly over the hor’
to i. Sometimes it slides down out of sight not to be heard
of again; sometimes somebody tackles it alid it becomes
led, living, and big. KGRW was like thatian idea that

liuiastic students and facility pushed until it became a
. lor extra-curricular activity. The honor system (may it
not rest ill peace!) made an appear nce, but didn’t make
the grade. ARENA is the newest idea to take shape
Ej‘ough its effect on the campus will be undecided for some
tl;-e.

There‘s a new idea just barely kicking around. It's
Would it be advantageous to house freshman girls in
erclass halls instead of freshman dorms?
Some people have wondered why the south campus
si'stem differs from that on north campus, Some of them
h,. re dismissed the idea with, “Oh, rules, I guess.” Most
l e probably accepted the status quo unquestionably 7
the status quo may well be the best situation for us.

Should such a change be modeled after north campus?

The possib ty of a hall system which would house

\ (men in one dorm for their four years here has been dis-

‘sed. However, there are greater architectural differ-

betweeu the quadrangle buildings than between the

of th campus halls. For instance, the facilities of Meals

(lililt in 1888) differ from those of Loos hall (1947).

all singles and doubles in Main do not offer the same
hung aiinngeiuents as three-room suites in Haines.

is it likely that it would be advantageous to women

‘t .live in one cottage for four years if it would limit the

'JlL‘TilJe)‘ of people they would become acquainted with.

'I! e is room for difference of opinion on the elative im-

1s tance of close friendships and numbers of i endships.

Could a compromise between the present women’s sys-
tem and the men's system be effected?

It is possible that freshmen could be assigned rooms in
~)er class halls with'the freedom to choose a new hall
'h year being retained. _

On the basis of experience with James cottage fresh-
nieu upperc iss and freshmen women can clear the hurdle
of rule differences when living in the same hall. James
freshmen have always been quickly absorbed into the gen-
elul campus scheme of living. ‘

There is the problem of freshman women being rele-
1; ed to the rooms left over after upperclass women have

'ked over the choice rooms ill the spring. Would it be
er to allow upperclass women the complete run of the
ll or quadrangle in room drawing, or should roomsbe re
solved for freshmen? In case rooms were set aside, it
ixuld have to be decided whether it is better to reserve
ain scattered rooms for freshmen or blocks of rooms
designated areas. ‘ _
The idea arose partly to counteract the persistent high
ol attitude which seems to remain with freshmen who
0 together ill a homogeneous group. They would undoubt~
' be more quickly absorbed into the college community
en the type of crowd movement charact istic 01 high

cool people is less a part of their way of liy ng.

It’s a new idea. It may not grow to anything mole

Message to Crinnellians

, This is the second in a series of guest editorials by distinguish-

American high commander in Germany alter the war.

.You,_as students iii our great American Colleges and

Universities, are preparing yourselves for lives of social
usefulness and individual. satisfactions. The education
which you enjoy within these institutions of learning is
posSIble only because we live iii a free nation. Our citizene
‘ship ill a free scolety is our most precious and priceless
:heritage.
‘ These are critical days for democracy and the free
‘world. Communism has engulfed a third of the world, and
lls bent on still further aggression. The struggle now going
on between the free nations of the world and international
‘Communism is essentially a conflict of ideas. Tile United
‘States is making a mass bid for the world to go the way
901' democracy and individual freedom. Soviet Russia is
making a bid for world totalitarianismga bid which rests
in large part upon complete and ruthless misrepresentation
of American ideals and aims.

As students of history, literature, political, physical
and social sciences, you know that what men believe to be
true has been as important as the truth itself in determinv
ing human events. If we are ever to achieve a secure and
lasting peace, the other peoples of the world must know
the truth. They must understand our ideals of freedom and
friendship for all men and all nations.

The Crusade for Freedom offers every American an
opportunity to play a part in a “great campaign of trut "
to win the war of ideas. The Crusade provides an immediate
and practical way of demonstrating our true intentions to
the world. It is “a spiritual airlift” designed to give com-
fort and courage to the 80 million people now living in Eur
rope who keep alive in their hearts the hope of freedom
and belf-government, With its symbolic World F‘reedoml
Bell, it proclaims our inherent belief ill man’s dignity and
right to freedom; it announces our determination to resist
any aggression upon that freedom anywhere on earth; it
declares our national unity and dedication to world peace
with freedom,

Working together in the Freedom Crusade, we can
help to put the free world on the offensive. By singing the
Freedom Scroll with its declaration of norld freedom, you,
as all individual, place yourself on record in the roll-call of
democracyia rollecall that one day must extend around
the world. I urge your participation in the Crusade andi
sincerely hope that you will exert your leadership to help
make it a great historic effort of free peoples.

Lucius D. Clay, Chairman
CRUSADE FOR FREEDOM

, Against Basic Comm

are the most
We disagree.[

Some wit once remarked that 'we
thoroughly half-educated nation on earth.”
In most cases, it isn’t evén half educated.

The other day, one professor held folth loud and long
on Semitic influences iii religion. At the elid of the class,‘
it turned out that several students hadn’t any idea what
the word meant. He mentioned this, with some surplise,
in another class, whereupon someone asked, “You mean
semantic?” ,

What gives around here? It’s not just that these words
aren’t usually found in comic books, and thus might not?
be encountered outside of high school. We seem to spend'
more time in elementary alld secondary education than do
students of any other country. Yet, when we graduate, We
can’t even use the language we were born with.

This editorial is against basic communications, a course
we all remember. Not because it’s a bad course, but be
cause most of what it covers should be natural to future
college students by the freshman level in high school.

In Europe, at the age of seven, children know far’less,
and are far less mature than Americans of the same age.~
Yet, by the time they are fifteen or sixteen, they are en—
tering college. And European colleges are harder than we
can imagine.

We have no pat solutions to offer, no grand schemes
to put across. We simply feel that college isn’t the place to
learn the English language. We should be ashamed of basic

comm.
