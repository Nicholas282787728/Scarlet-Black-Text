Cul' Alumni S St B

To Two Annually:
Copy Size Raised

The Alumni S S: B, a news—
paper which has gone to alumni
and parents five times a year
lcrmerly, will be sent out only
twice a year. Mr. Herbert Pres»
cott, Director of Public Kola»
tions and editor of the AS and

’ has said that this cut is part ofd

the general budgetary cutting

which has gone on this year outs _

side of the education program.

Though the alumni have al~
ways donated toward the paper,
the money which came in never
exceeded more than twenty per
cent of the cost in any given
year. Therefore, the college has
also given money toward pub—
lication. it is no longer able to
do so.

This cut, however, is not what
it appears to be. When the par
per appeared in live issues it,
contained 36 pages a year. Froml
new on, each issue will be twelve
pages. Prescott says, that with
only twelve pages less, there
will be little difference in the
material which appears.

Also, in the last year, there
has been a system whereby class
agents have sent out two 01‘
three letters to those who were
graduated in their year. These
letters contain all class news.
This system has proven so at
:tective that the letters are supr
pleinentary to the S 8: B,

to Appleton, Wisconsin, Saturday
to face the defending champions,

turning lettermen from ’ last

Grinnell's hopes seem to rest
largely on veteran Brett Taylor,

Other troubles plaguing Coach

With onesthird of the season

What happened to’ Coe

fact that Coe has 33 boys playing
their first year of ball for the
Crimson and‘ Gold. .Twer‘ity are
sophomores. some of whom have
come up from Coe’s unbeaten;
frosh team of last year. Thci
most important additions, how'-
ever, ,are seven junior college‘
transfers, all of whom haverplay-
