(Pioneer BB Squad Invited to NAIB Tournament

\/ GrinneII’s cagers, for the first

time in the history at the
school, have been invited and
will accept a post season has
ketball tourney: the NAlB, The
National Association for inter.
collegiate Basketball is a tourn-
ament run for small colleges
the way the NCAA held at
Madison Square Garden in New
York is conducted for large
schools. in fact. the NAib, anr
nually held at Kansas City, is
the most important small col.
lege tournament in the nation.

Grinnell, receiving a first

round bye, will play the wins‘

her of the Parson—Morningside
tilt at Pella Saturday night.
“Either iive is capable of giv—
ing us as tough an encounter
as we have had all year." afr
firmed coach John Pfitsch.

If the Pioneers win Saturday
night they earn the right to
represent the state of Iowa at
Kansas City. There will be
teams, representing 32 states,
playing in the tourney. Hamline,
last year‘s champs, will again
be on hand to represent Min.
nesota. Beloit, who finished
third in the tourney, will once
again hoid forth for Wisconsin.

Morningside’s Maroans work
from the single post and em-
gloy the fast break, Sioux City’s
starting five averages six feet
two inches. The squad holds a
7-5 league record, guod for
third place in the North Central
basketball conference. In 25

games the Maroones have 5491

points per contest, while the
Pioneers have averaged better
than 64 points per game, Clayt
Bristow, all conference center
who averages 17 points per
game, and Dick Weidemfieid,
also an conference, pace the
Maroon attack

Parson's 16-5 win—loss record
is tops in the state, as is their
68A shooting average. Coach
Pfitsch considers the Wildcats
one of the toughest and scrap-
iest quintets in Iowa. Parsons,
piloted by 0. B. Nelson, former
Crinnell set-shot artist and
basketball coach, has about the
fastest team in the state, Be-
cause of their height disadvan—
tage, the wildcats rely on speed
and the fast break to wear down
their taller opponents Bud
Baccus, the Wildcats‘ ace long
shot artist, has averaged 14.6

 

‘Grinnell Takes
:Cornell Game;
Loses To Carls

In spite of Grinnell’s 81-51
lwin over Cornell here last TueSA
day, Cnrleton's sages upset of
the Pioneers a week ago seems
likely to send the Scarlet and
Black cagers to third place in
the Midwest conference stand-
ings.

if the Carls down the Rams
tomorrow night, they will waltz
into second place as their 773
(700) record would then beat
Grinnell’s 974 (.692) mark. A
Carleton defeat, however, would
give GrinneII the runner—up

Grinnell led the Northfield
club 63-60 with only 45 seconds
remaining in the game, but
Carleton gained possession of
the ball after a Pioneer pass
went out of bounds. A basket
by Frank Schlaffer and a free
throw by Dick Wollin then sent
,the contest into an overtime
iperiod.

Gas Saunders bucket was the
only Crinnell tally in the extra
period as Carleton went on to
take the hectic contest, 66-65,

and another charity toss hy

Grinnell Loses

To Chicago U.

The GrinneIl college track
team opened its season last
Saturday by dropping a duali
meet to a strong University oil
Chicago squad, 67 173 to 37 2-3.i
Tomorrow coach Burl v. BerryI
will take ten men to the North
Central Relays at Naperville,

“Our lack of training facili»
ties really hurt in the Chicago
meet,” commented Berry, ”And
under the circumstances I
thought that the team did very
well." Grinnell’s training area
for winter track is limited to
the basement of the women‘s;

Sophomores Show Well
"I was well pleased with the
sophomores on the squad," said
Berry, “Don Young and Auan
Goldfarb took two of our three
firsts, and Don Slocum jumped
19' 5" for a Lhird in the broad
jump. If Dick Friedman had
been able to get a little more
experience, he might have won
the high hurdles, but under the

circumstances he did well to
harsh third.”

John Bonyata got the other
Pionccr first, taking the sixty
yard dash. Steve Hitchcock
place second to Bonyata. An
outstanding Grinnell perform—
ance was turned in by Hugh
Acton who finished second in
the half mile in the fast time of

the top 880 men in the country
won in 1:5“.
