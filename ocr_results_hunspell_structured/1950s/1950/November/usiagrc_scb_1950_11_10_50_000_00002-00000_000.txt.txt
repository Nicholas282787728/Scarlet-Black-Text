Student-Faculty Committee
Plans Meeting With Trusiees

This is the third in series explaining organizations oi student
government. _ ,4

For the lirst time, is student committee will have an oppor-
to meet the board at trustees. A trip to Des Memes for the

State of the Union .

i Sex Again on Trial

The informal social chairman is won-
dering how informal socializing can get.
lOnly the subdued light of the juke box
lbreaks the dim shadows of the room. Soon,
if this continues, eagleseyed student moni-
tors will have to be stationed in the room
as shoulder-tappels. It is a disagreeable
task as well as unpleasant invasion of
[realms better left private.

It appears that once again straight-
bocked chairs will invade the Union, couches
will be relegated to Loose basement, and, it
is hoped, chaste peace and contentment will

‘ There are few students, under circum-
istances not involving them personally, who
condone lavish public display of affection.
They do not accept the mores of our so-
ciety. Examples of the truth of this are
constantly apparent. Why, for instance, is
there a great deal more comment about the
scenes in a French movie which may be
showing downtown than there is about the
considerably‘more surprising scenes flashv
ed in the Union loungc‘.7 Why, if there
weren‘t a real question of taste involved,
would the Navy, in its code of officer be-
havior, advise that public display of affec—

tion is unbecoming
gentleman?

As we heard it stated by a student in
a hall last week, “There‘s something dis«
tasteful about mass sex.”

The absurd argument offered by some,
“If the administration doesn‘t offer us a,
place, they can expect it in the Union and
loggias," holds no water. Picture if you can,
an officially sanctioned mush-room. Try
to frame in your mind, if you have advo-
cated such, explaining that particular
campus feature to your parents, or an old-
er campus visitor. Could you make anyone
sympathetic to it?

The question always resolves to,
“Then What CAN we do about it?" And to
our way of thinking the answer resolves
into an argument just as consistent.

Grow up. A lack of taste and maturity
is the basic fault behind every complaint
we offer about our lack of privileges on
this campus. Only a. demonstration of ma-
ture, level-headed behavior will ever allow
us to use our own discretion in such social
questions as the use of alcohol, women‘s
hours, an academic honor system, and in-
ter-related social problems.

leaders‘ conference in the fall
or 1949. it was tried out last
year with only partial satisfsz

ed by Dr. Stevens at the lead—

Blough says that he is confi-
dent that it will be much more

effective this year. Two month- ,

far this year.

To the Editor:

This is just in case some oth—
er grateful student doesn‘t send
in a similar acknowledgement.
I’ve been here at Grinnell since
1 was a ireshman; I'm now a
senior. I think i have attended
at least as many college sponv
sored parties as anybody.

For these reasons l leel quali-
hed to say that the party last
weekend in the women’s gym
was the best that I have ever
attended here. There was noths

supplied by Gedabouts, and the
people that didn't have a good
time have only themselves to
blame.

Last spring when certain peo
ple left this campus there was
much talk that the days of good
parties were ended. I do not say
that the psrties last year were
not good, only that this one was
better. ,-

ror the first time in
three years 1 have confidence
’that the money spent for Gad-
_ebouts has been wisely placed
in competent hands.
Sincerely,
John sly.
