A Tribute to Redemption
it behooves us to comment on the state of the union7
the union of each of the tuentysone campus buildings to,
the other via new, broad, stl'ig‘ht and curved, flat-lying!
smooth,-and so forth, sidewalks; for now those students
who slogged through verllal marshes, those less daring- who
took lnore cilcumnavigatory routes, those who stirred not
in order to avoid the hazards of traveling to class, may pass
ill comfort and safety.
We owe the powers that be a humble and heartfelt
apology for ollr scathing editorial of May 26, 1950. It was

written at a time when we had lost our faith in the little
god that gives great white sidewalks.

Here the editors pause in memory of the courag-
eous souls, who, like Esther, met a dim and slimy
death, while braving the mysterious swamplands
which formerly appeared seasonally on oltr campus

Each morning we have noted the acts of reverence per-
formed by residents of south campus as they embark on the
three-lane highway from Haines to the Union. It is not
uncommon to see a few of the more thoughtful pause and
face the east in a few moments of silent thanksgiving
