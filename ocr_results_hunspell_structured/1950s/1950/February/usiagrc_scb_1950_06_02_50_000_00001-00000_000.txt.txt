By Essenby

Yes, they are going to try it-
again. A second performance of
‘~'Up A Tree” will be given
Saturday night at 3:00. Only
this time it seems that the high
school auditorium will be in use
until just three and a half hours
before the show. The motto of
the cast is now, little “practice,
makes perfect."

There is going to be some-

Sheila Boyer and Norm Glass
will not be here to sort of tie
the show together. It's going to
