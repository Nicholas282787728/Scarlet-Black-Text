Tradition

The Boar’s head dinner is a

has been inmorted from Queens

of this ancient legend

As one story guns. the boar’s
head is attributed to Scandinav-
ian mythology It is said that a
Norse fertility god, Frey-er. diety
of peace and plenty, would use the
Boar to ride upon in his religious
missions. Then armlnd Christmas
timé, when all Lh harvest was
completed, Frey pagan ad-
mirers would 53 ifice a bear in
his honor. It is believed that the
boar’s head was pickled in brine
and served before (he'meai in
OrdCr to work up a thirst.

At College

This is how the celebration
started at Queen’s. It appears
that on: day back in the lzth
century a student was walking
in a neighboring forest and
studying Aristotle while he walk-
ed, He was attacked by a wild
boar who rushed at him with

PM Sunday

By Claire Korstadt

and ceremony, sponsored by the
y and the League Board, will
be held Sunday, December ill,
in the women’s dining room at
630 in the evening. Dr, Klausc
nor will give a short address
at the ceremony, which will be
followed by a music program in
Main lounge. .

Yule Log Saved

The Yule Log dinner and never
mony began in the same period
in which the women’s quad-
rangle was built. it was in-
tended that the Yule Log should
be kept from Christmas to
,Christmas. the embers being

used to light the fire next year.
‘ The First Yule Log i

An account of the first sci»
‘Vice was written to Dean Gard-
ner in lsas by Mary Stimson
Gates, the founder. "We held
our iii-st Christmas dinner in the
dining room, with candles to
light the tables. home made
candy, and turkey, Then we
gathered. still strong, in the
drawing room,"

Started By Main

“President. J. T, H. Main lit
the first Yule Log, with remarks
about the wonder and beauty of
the Christmas season and the
hope that we would carry it
with us wherever we went .—
country communities or large
cities We sang two or three
carols by firclight That was all
—about onerl‘ialf hour."

"Dean Gates carefully qtisnche
ed the log and later had a metal
box made in which to keep it
for the following year. ‘May the
Lord bless you and keep you;
may the Lord make His face to
shine upon you and give yaui
peace,”

Unchanged Tradition

The tradition of the service

has changed little since that
time. Now. though, it is a cop
operative event, put on by both
the YWCA and the League
Board. The presidents of both
organizations light the fire. It‘
has become traditional to wear
ionly white, and the day is now
the Sunday beiore vacation,
‘rather than Thursday.

charge of invitations, Guests
