and results in a thesis or pro—
ject, all based on the Scripps
humanities curriculum. There
are no honors courses.

Occidental is “moving slolw
ly in setting up independent
study,” to avoid “further drain
on the time and energy of the
faculty.” The number of courses
offered each year is being re-
duced, and courses with less
than lo enrolled are being dis—
continued. Honors work is being
considered.

At Stanford, required work
is done outside of class in every
course. The faculty intends in
Each Concentration to leave
“something unstudied,” so that
the student will have to do some
special work "on his own."

Waiving of various graduation
requirements is practiced at
Redlands for top entering stur
dents who elect to do special
work, under careful counseling.
Redlands also practices course
acceleration for the “very gift-
ed."

lin colleges in Ohio to discover
some fairly intensive programs

Wabash ,on a study \
for selﬂevaluation, is looking
toward consolidating its
courses and altering more of
them in alternate years. It
already has much independent
work, encouraged partly by
the fact that faculty members
are free to conduct their
classes as they choose.

Antioch, long known for its
study-work system, has an aca—
demic year based on two eight-
week and two 12—week periods
with students alternating periods
of employment with their col-
lege work. Independent study,
involving an “occasional con-
ference with the instructor," may
take up to half of each period,
and upperclassmen may work
independently in some courses
for most of the period.
