Golfers Seek Win
In Drake Contest

Grinnell’s varsity golf squad
took to the links today in the
Drake university invitational
tournament in Des Moines. Eight
Iowa college teams were expect
ed‘to take part in the eighteen
hole Drake event, says Coach
Irwin L. Simone. All competi»
tion will be medal play.

Although still seeking a win
in dual meet competition, the
.Pioneer golfers have gained
valuable experience through
their two ties, with Knox and
Cornell. “With the help of a
handicap for our small size,
we’ll have a fair chance to be
in the running at Drake," is the
opinion of Coach Simone.

The regular Grinnell team of

only one lnzitch. Winning for the
Pioneers in the singles matches
were Hautzinger, Kogen, , Prater,
and Dave Kinser. These four
also teamed up to take two
doubles matches‘,

The team is still not up to the
expectations of Coach Pfitsch.
Even taking this into considerae
ticn Pfitsch still believes that
the chances of taking two are
very good. According to Pfitsch
the team is weak in doubles
play and the top have. not
reached their top form.
