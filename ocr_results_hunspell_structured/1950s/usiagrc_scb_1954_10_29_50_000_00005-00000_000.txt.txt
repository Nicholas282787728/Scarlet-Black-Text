Carleton Stops“
Local Harriers' ‘
Victory String

Carleton’s defending Midwest
conference cross-country champs
ions proved a little too tough
for Grinnell as the Knights
edged the horriers 27—30 on the
local semile course last Sature
day.

Although the Boothmeu cops
ped first, third, and fifth places,
the Carls' team depth carried
them to victory.

Qntub Wins

Little Dave Qutub streaked
across the finish line in 15 min.
52,6 sec. for first place. His time
was only five seconds off the
course record set by George
Drake last year. In Saturday’s
meet, Drake dropped out.

Completing Grinnell’s scoring
was Larry Schaleger in third,
Bab Downs in fifth, rritz Goree
ham, tenth, and Frank Hays,
eleventh.

Balance Wins ior Cal-ls

John McCamant, student coacn
and last year's conference meet
winner, was Second to lead the
Carls. Earl Neil placed fourth,
while his teammates took up
sixth through ninth places to
cinch the meet.

These finishers included
Doug Sprague, Paul Schultz,
Bill Murphy, and Wilbur Olsen.
Placing lath was Martin Baker.
Senior Don Clokey, tenth—finishr

Vernon. The Rams have only
two men out for the varsity
sport this season, but Coach Gil
Wilson intends to run his fresh-
men also. rive men are needed
to make up a team, so the meet
will doubtlessly be forfeited to
Grinnell.

Making up the Pioneer irosh
squad will be Paul Barks, Ron
Book, John Hering, Al Ho,
George Mchmsey, and Bob
Wagner. The yearlings won their
first meet against Coe with
Wagner and Hering finishing
one-two.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Needing a victory to escape the Midwest conference
cellar, the Grinnell football eleven faces Cornell tomorrow
at Ash Park stadium in Mt Vernon.

The two teams are currently deadlocked for seventh
place in the loop, along with Knox. Cornell has one win

and four defeats to the Pio-
neer’s 0-3-2 record, The
Rams’ only victory was over
Monmouth by a l4~13 score.

Points

 

From this vantage point it

looks like a banner weekend for

Pioneer athletes. The cross—country Squad apparently has a cer-
tain victory since the Rams have only mwo men out for the sport,
three less than the minimum for an official meet.

The,!oothall contest with the Rams is less certain: the two
teams are tied for seventh place in the conference. Cornell. de-
spite their essentially sophomore lineup, has turned in some very
creditable performances, including a 7.5 loss to St, Olaf, who

Gﬂnnell tied 13-13.

Grinnell’s squad this
year.

The position, quarterback that
is, is ably manned by senior
Vic Rampelberg, vic is in his
second year of varsity ball for
Grinnell after transferring from
Iowa U. in the middle of his
freshman year. ‘

Good Field General

According to coach John
Pfitsch Vic has all the qualities
needed to make a fine field
general. Not: only is \he a fine
all—around player but he is very
popular with his teammates,
which is the top requirement
for his task. Vic is especially
good under pressure and acts
as a steadying influence upon
his mates. His versatility is in»
diceted by Pfitsuh’s statement
that he could play any position
on the team and do a fine job
of it.

When asked what he liked
most about the rugged gridiron
sport Vic replied, “It’s a great
competitive sport and helps de—
velop teamwork, leaving no room
for individualists." Grinnell’s
next three grid clashes should
be victories according to. their
leader and he is sorry that the
record isn’t better at this time
than it is.

“After the -St. Olaf game i
thought we were on our way
but that mess at Coe gave us
a setback that took some time
to recover from," is how Vic
sums up the team’s poor record.

Leads Passing Attack

At the present Vic is the Pier
necr's leading passer with 16
completions in 41 attempts for
a total of 196 yards. This also
ranks him well ulp with the
other aerielists in the Midwest
Conference, Added to this vic
has gained 19 yards on the
.ground for a total of 217 yards.
This makes him second to co-
captain Nick Ryan in total
offense for the Scarlets.

vic, who hails from Welbnan,
lowa, is a math major at Grin»
nell but his plans for the fur
ture are indefinite. He expects
the draft to take care of his
worries for awhile. .

added incentive of playing be-

may turn out to be a battle be-
tween Ryan and Galloway.
