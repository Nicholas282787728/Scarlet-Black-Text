Brand-new national survey
shows college students prefer Luckies

Last year a survey was made in leading colleges

throughout the country which showed that smokers in

those colleges preferred Luckies to any other cigarette.

This year another nation-wide survey was made—a

representative survey of all students in regular colleges

coast to coast. Based on thousands of actual student in-

terviews—this survey shows that, as last year, Luckies

lead again—lead over all other brands, regular or king-

size—and by a wide margin! The reason: Luckies taste
better.
