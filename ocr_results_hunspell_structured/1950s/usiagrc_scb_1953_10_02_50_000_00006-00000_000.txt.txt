Urges Non-Insured
Student to Choose

All students who did not in-
dicate whether they wish student
health and accident insurance
during . registration days are
urged to do so by Fred Ramsey,
of the Ramsey insurance agency.

Forty—nine percent of the stu-
dent body has purdhased the
policy, and tortyone percent has
signed a statement rejecting it.
The students whd Ihave not in—
dicated their preference have
been asked to go to the trea-
surers office and do so at once.

Thé policy, costing $6.50 per
semester and $13.00 per school
year, covers all hospital, medical,
and surgical expense up to $500
which may be incurred by the
student through accidental in.
jury. lt also covers hospital and
care costs at the rate of $6.00
per day up to rourteen daiys, in
case of illness.

This is the iirst time since
1948 that the policy has been
offered on a voluntary basis,
Prior to this time it was incor-
porated within the semester
fee.
