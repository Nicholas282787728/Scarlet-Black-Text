The Turn Of The serewl

It looks as if the proposed new student government'
constitution has been shot in the back by the three Deans
and President Stevens. In a complete reversal from pre-
viously implied and stated backing for the basic principles
of the constitution, the four administration members L‘ll'eW
up a document last weekend that would put the constitu-

tion on a carefully vague, puppet basis.

It would seem that all the months of work by the;
student committee is down the drain; the only remnantl
is a disguised corpse—the corpse of present student gov—‘
ernment at Crime“. The question is, Why did the Doll'el‘si
that be intentionally lead us into a dead-end.

They must have known when they began that the:
deadeend was inevitable. Did they believe we‘d be too lazy
to take up the challenge, thus allowing them to make~
magnanimous gestures they would never have to come
across on? Student co-operation with and trust of the
administration Will probably decline from its present all—
time low.

The faculty‘didn’t have to commit itself, since the ad,
building got there with the dagger first. What the faculty
motivations and underlying opinions are is unknown, since
they took no stand on either the original plan or the newi
document. But, in the last analysis the fact remains: the
student body has been cheated again.

And after. this Week’s wholesale suspensions and
campusments it looks as if the administration has a face
for each part of its double standards of honesty and just
punishment but nobody seems to have a stick to hold over
the ad. building.

been waiting hopelully,for woe
men’s week and the annual
proof that women are almost one
fiftieth the equal of men. Since‘
nothing has hoppended i have;
reached the conclusion Uhat‘
Women don‘t really want equal-
ity. Susan B. Anthony and her
suffragettes wanted it, but prob-

anythmg bettel‘l The Susan B.

sion. It’s a good Lhing. too; but
I still miss women's week.

Three weeks to go: That‘s alll
we seniors have left and 1 surge,
pose i should be mellowed, but;
things still bother me. Ever
Since I came here I’ve heard}
about how the Grinnell social
program was and how no one
needed to leave because it was
all right here on the campus.
I've lmlssed a law sock hops over,
the years but never without a
feeling of inadequacy that the
campus 'social life clid‘n't satisiy
my thirst for diversion and en-
tertainment l

 

Try to imagine my *bewilder-i
ment, then, when the admini-
stration imposed sentence on the‘
party of truant freshmen. The,
punishment? Confinement to the;
supposedly socially fulfilling
Grinnell campus for the rest oi‘
the semester.

It’s true that Mr. Brown has‘
been having c difficult spring,
but one thing I’m halppy about
is that none oi the trouble has
been connected with registeredi
automobiles. Cars at Grimelll
came in amidst all sorts of dire
predictions, but so far the re
sults have been successful. Re-
sponsibility breeds itself and the;

car experiment is proving it. ,

Justice for all: I don’t attend
all lof the events that have been.
presented in the chapel but i do‘,
remember hearing International‘
Relations speakers, musical recite
ols and many other programs of
a secular nature. Isn’t the cur-5
rent chapel series concerned with,
the history of Grinnell in a way
that makes the religious aspect
of the service no more than anl
excuse for a Mutual Admira-l
tion Society meeting that con-
veniently fills the gap between
Monday and Friday ROTC drill
hours. What differentiates thel
above mentioned perfonmences'

Asia better than "South Pacific".l
Less entertaining, perhaps, but1
no less secular. ‘
What’s 11 from 100?

‘the Situation over. in the week

,To Dr. Samuel N. Stevens, Pres-
ident, Grinneil College:

As a witness to the kind of
ldiscipline that has been im-
posed on a number of freshmen
,at Grinnell this past week, i
would like to otter particular
acknowledgement of a letter
iwl‘itten by Governor Bradford of
Plymouth Colony:

”It may be in this case as
it is with waters when their
streams are stopped or turn»
med up, when they get pas<
sage they iiow with more
noise and disturbance, than
when they are suiicrea to
run quietly in their own
channels. So'wickadness being
here more nearly looked into.
so as it cannot run in a com:-

tive decision, no one even hint-
ed that he wished to discuss the
matter.

(2) 1 disagree with your two
main points. (a) that the draw-
ing of the curtains completely
secularizes the Chapel, (1:) that
anything is equally appropriate
anywhere.

(a) Even with the curtain
drawn, the chapel is still n
place with a ditierencc—pews,
hymn books, stained glass
windows, church structure,
and also of religious associa- ,
tions in the minds oi those ‘
who attend the secular pro
grams.

(in) Not everything is appro-
priate everywhere. One’s Three

, With regard to the several

Hard as the line between
sacred and secular is to draw,
difficult as it is m practice
on this campus without an
auditorium, there should be
some limits set by good
taste, if nothing else. Even in
your editorial you suggested
that if and when an audi-
torium is built some programs
should be shifted to it. Why ‘
