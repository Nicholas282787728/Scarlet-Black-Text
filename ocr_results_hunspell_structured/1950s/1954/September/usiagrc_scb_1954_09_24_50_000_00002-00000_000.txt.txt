Preps Or People? '

The two basic aims of prepping appear to be the devel-
opment of class consolidarity, and the integration of fresh-l
man students with upperclassmen. These aims are not, in
themselves, incompatible.

It has been asserted by a noted sociologist that}
allegiance to small groups within an institution or state
strengthen a man’s loyalty to that institution or state. In
accordance with this it would seem that the allegiance of
new students toward that amorphic massithe freshman
class—would strengthen and reinforce their loyalty to the
college.

But now a nasty word comes iniconformity. The prep-‘
ping system calls for more than allegiance; it calls for alike-
ness. Freshman are so busy learning to be just like other
freshman that little integration takes place outside of the
freshman class. At least not for a long while. .

Must conformity accompany class consolidarity? Mustl
indivﬁiu'alism be sacrificed for integration?

0.

Let’s watch the prepping program in the weeks to
come, and note whether the freshman are primarily People
or Preps. If the latter is the case, the prepping program
seriously needs revision.

lCowles Frosh Express Approval
Of Modified PreppinLhogram

”Our hall is handling things in
ademocratic manner and this
‘has a better effect in that it
instills greater hall loyalty."

Tom Skornia, Cowles 2nd, “I
think it is a fine precedent that
should be extended to other
hails as soon as possible.”

Tom Aaron, Cowles 3rd.
”There's not too much to say
when there’s nothing to do."

Robert Green, Cowles 2nd,
“l'in for it. I think it’s vastly
superior to the other hall’s pro-
grams. It does make everyone
seem more friendly." ,

John Phillips, Cowles 2nd,
“I'm in favor of the way our
upperclassmen are running the
prepping program. A freshman
needs all the time he can get
during the first few weeks for

lstudics and for orienting him-

self. it shouldn’t be taken up
with prepping nonsense."
