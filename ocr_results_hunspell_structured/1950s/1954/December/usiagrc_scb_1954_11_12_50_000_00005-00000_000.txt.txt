when asked why he picked

led, “There's nothing like it as

When his coach, John Pfitsch,

aluable to the team he said

am one was his steady and

After graduation this June,
Dave plans on entering the army
as soon as possible so he can
“get it out of the way." His
plans after that include graduate
school in journalism. Dave also
was eager to point out that
sometime between this June and
grad school he intends to marry
the 1953 homecoming queen.

The poor record of this year’s
squad is due to the fact that
they can never put two halves
of good football together ac—
cording to their co-captain. "It's
a little late but we‘ve finally
found ourselves and will win the
last one tomorrow" says Dave.

Full teams will be entered by Carleton, Coe, Grinnell,
Lawrence and Monmouthl Ripon, with four men and Co -

nell with two men will not
be eligible for team honors

This is the fifth consecu-
tive year the meet is being
held on the Svmile Washing-
ton park course. Although
the teams have met in dual
competition this season, the
championship will be decid-
ed entirely on the basis of
this meet.

Carleton Defends Title

The Carleton runners, led by
student coach and captain John
McCamant, last: year’s titlist,
will be after their fourth
straight championship, but they
will have to contend with Grin-
nell and Lawrence. Lawrence
was second last year and Grin-
noll failed to finish a full team.

The loop coaches have rated
Carleton and Grinnell even,
with Lawrence close behind.
Monmouth and See were rated
next in that order.

ln Contest Sat.

The first B-game round-robin
football season in the history of
the Midwest conference winds to
a close this week, with the
championship already decided
but most of the other eight Dosi—
tions still in doubt, The champ»
ionship Carleton outfit, which
clinched the title a week ago
‘anol added an eighth wm Satur-
day, can sit by and watch the
other eight teams scramble for
the remaining spots.

The big battle is the Coe~St,
Olaf clash at Nol'thfield, Minne—
sota, to decide second place, Ba-
for the season started this game
was tabbed astheoneto decide
the title, As it is, however, St. Olaf
(5-1-1) must win or tie to keep
second place if Lawrence (5-270)
beats Knox (L670), as is ex
pected.

Coe (4-3-0) is sure of at least
a lourth place, but could tie for
third with Lawrence should the
Vikings fall to Knox. After 1057
iiig 3 of their first 4 games (by

total of 9 points), the K0—
hawks have hit their stride,
winning their last three games
(3515 over Cornell, 46-21 over
Knox, and 39-19 over Mon-
mouth).

The St Olaf Lions were idle
last week after recording 5
wins, a lz-lA. loss to Carleton,
and a 13-13 tie with Grimiell.

Four teams, RipDn (2-44)
Cornell (z 570), Monmouth (2-5a
0), and Grinnell (174-2) have a
chance for fifth place, and oddly
enough they pair off on the final
clay of the season
