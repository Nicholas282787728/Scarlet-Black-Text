‘ngnelré-ll principles linden
lying a new student gvel'n-
merit constitution being
drafted for the Gl‘innell
college campus were released
this Week by the special
committee who are prepar-
ing it.

Committee members are
Student Council President
Roger Perry, chairman; Kit-
ten Al'vesoll, Barney Gise
senaas, Lois Grosser, Kent
Halsey, Bill Hamilton, Carole
Helgesnn, Ed Laing, Portia
McNally, Milt Meigs, Norm
Noe and Bill Rex.

The basic feature of the
plan is a
authority and responsibility
(within a Student executive
council), over all noneacd-
demic matters.

Under this elected council

would be a split between ex-
ecutive and judicial authority.
All executive otticers (includ
ing social heads).,would ,be ap—
pointed by the council; the
council would also serve as a
central authority over student
committees handling functions
now performed by the Student
Organizations committee, the
Social Calendar committee, and
the Board of Publications. (Un-
der the present system, thae
committees are Studentrfaculty
groups), *

Also under the executive
council would be two separate
agencies to handle all men’s
and women’s judicial problems,
penalties and fines, The struc-
ture and basic functions at the
League Board and Council of
House Presidents would be re-
tained much as they now exist.

Special committee chairman
Roger Perry stated that his
group hopes to have the com.
plete constitution ready by
February 10. The reason no in.
formation has been given out
betore is that details have been
changing throughout the writ-
ing. it the constitution receives
both faculty and adnnmstration
approval, it will be submitted
to the Student Organizations
committee and then presented

order to go into effect, the con-
stitution must be ratified sap—
erately by two—thirds of all
men students. and also by two~
thirds of all women students.
