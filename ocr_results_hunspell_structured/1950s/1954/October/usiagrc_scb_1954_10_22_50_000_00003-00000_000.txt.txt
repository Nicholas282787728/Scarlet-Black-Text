In 1894

sixty years ago six men or
Grninell college (then lowa coir
liege) met in a slltdant's room to
plan the publication of a semi.
weekly newspaper, which was
issued the next lall under thei
nameplate of the Scarlet and}
Black. l
It was the iii-st real new'e‘
paper the college had and the
first college newspaper publishe,‘
ed west of the Mississippi rivalii
i

For 25 years prior to that time,
there had been a college publie
cation but it was more like the‘
average high school monthly
magazine a mixture of news
and literary material. 1

The first attempt at a col—
lege newspaper was made in,
1868. For five years it occupied‘
space in the Grinnell Herald bee
(fore becoming a separate sheet
named the Newsletter.

The Pulse

In 1889 the Pulse (the mast
head read, “We pulsatc fo‘rt»
nightly during the college year")
was established as a similar ri-,
val publication. The light furl

existence of these two college‘,

papers lasted hardly a year and_
1390 saw the union of the News
letter and The Pulse into 3|
single publication known as Thei
Unit.

In 1894 the SM; was founded,
and two years later: the union
of the 5&3 and the Unit was
eitected. The Unit was a month—
ly literary magazine while the
5&3 retained its original form
as the semi-weekly news organ
of the college. in 1912 the Unll.
folded because of lack of sup—
port. ‘\

Emphasis on Sports

During the 5&B's early years
emphasis was on sports, literary
societies‘and social news. The
writing was (loner-y and senti-
mental and there was no attempt
at “makeup” (making the page:
Visualll‘ attractive) The editors:
ials were concelned mainly with
sports, but also with such things
as getting lights installed in‘
Goodnow and the library, and
getting walks laid in mucheltsed
parts or the campus,

However. the 8&3 occasionally
printed political editorials, The,
Bryan vs. McKinley election wasl
the subject oi much cclitoriall
comment. Later the‘ sails was‘
strongly in favor oi Wilson.

During the period irom 1908

format. Headlines were used,1
there were more and biggcr ads .
