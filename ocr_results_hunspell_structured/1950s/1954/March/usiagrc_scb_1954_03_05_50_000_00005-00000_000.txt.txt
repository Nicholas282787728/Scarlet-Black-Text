meet. Although rated as slight underdogs to host Knox
the nine man Pioneer squad stands an excellent chance of
copping their first loop crown.

0n the basis of best performances over the year Grin-

nell is second ’to none and is

rated second only by virtue

of a 48-45 defeat by Knox. Coach by Simone says that the

big problem faced by his char

25 yd. pool at Knox since most
of our meets haye been in 20
yd. pools. Difficulty on turns led
to Grinnell's defeat by Knox and
Simone hopes to overcome this.

All the races promise to be
very close as most contenders
are separated by only a few
tenths of a second. Leading
Grinnell will be co-captain
Wally Bragdon in the 200 yd.
backstroke and the 150 yd in—
dividual medly, and Joel Stubbs
in the 50 and 100 yd. freestyle
races. Bragdon was touched out
in both of his specialties by Bob
Anderson of Knox when the two
met two weeks ago but only
by inches. His best times in
both events are equal to Anders

strong Pioneer Relays

In addition to these indivld<
ual stars Grinnell is also count-
ing heavily on the 300 yd. med-
ley relay squad and the 400
yd. freestyle quartet, both of
which bettered the existing loop
marks. The medley outfit com-
posed of Tom Hejna, Vassilakos
and Howie Runyan has been
beaten only by Knox and then
only because of a bad turn. The
only defeat of the 400 team was
at the hands of the University
of Nebraska in the first meet
of the season. It is composed
of Bunyan, Heina, Bragdon arid
Stubbs.

others counted on for points
by Simone are leyan in the
individual medley, Hejna in the
backstroke, his brother Bill and
John Pike in the diving and
co-captain Barry Lawrence and
Doug Banister in the 200 and
400 yd. freestyle races. A big
part oi Grinnell’s chances for
the crown rest on the ability
or these men to pick up the
all important third and fourth
place points.

entered are St. Olaf, Cornell,

Winter attributed his slow
start to the “flu bug" and a
case of “senioritis.” Also there
was a better balance of scoring
on the entire Pioneer team this
year.

Bob, who played high school
basketball at Franklin in Cedar
Rapids, earned his third varsity
basketball letter this year. Last
year he was chosen as center
on the Midwest conference first
team and his 233 average was
the second highest in the league.

In his varsity career Bob
bombarded the basket with 909
points, second highest in the
In his
sophomore year he notched 234
points, climbed to 350 last year
and added 325 this year.

Winter voices approval of
Grinnell’s policy of no athletic
aid or scholarships. He says,
“One’s primary objective in go-
ing to college should be to learn
something, not solely to partici-
pate in intercollegiate athletics.
However, being out for basket.
ball has built up my self-con—
fidence and also my grades, as
I have to budget my time more
carefully." .
