“On Liberty”

By prohibiting formal debate on whether Red China
should be admitted to the U. N. at Annapolis and West
Point, the army and navy have violated that most cherished
and revered promise of the constitution, the freedom of
speech, and have dealt a severe blow to the concept of
education for democracy.

The reasons given for this action will not withstand
the most cursory consideration. The army states its policy
is not to let cadets engage in debate on such a controver—
sial subject and that at any rate, national policy toward
Communist China has already been established, President
Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles have stressed that policy
on this subject is not cut and dried, but is an extremely
important issue of current debate,

The navy has said that officers who argue on the
affirmative side of the question will “liable to misrepre-
resentation” and would provide the communists with. a
propaganda advantage. What more powerful pro-communist
propaganda than that a supposedly free state denies a por-
tion of its citizenery freedom to formally debate a question
for the sake of intellectual exercise?

McCarthy may have lost face but it is evident from
such a case as this that his philosophy has done irrepar—
able harm. The need for a responsible, intelligent, and free
exchange of ideas was never so evident as it is right now,
yet it was never so clearly or truly stated as by John Stuait
Mill a little over 100 years ago, in his essay, “On Liberty",
quoted below.

“We recognize the necessity to the mental well being
of mankind (on which all their other well-being depends)
of freedom of opinion, and freedom of the expression of
opinion, on four distinct grounds . . . First, if any opinion
is compelled to silence, that opinion may for aught we can
certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own
infallibility. -

”Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it
may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth,
and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject
is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the col»
lision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth
has any chance of being supplied.

“Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true,
but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually
is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of
those who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice,
with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds.

“And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the
doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfee-
bled, and deprived ‘of its vital effect on the character and
conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession,
inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and pre-
venting the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction
from reason or personal experience.”

Letters

To the Editor:

There is something that I feel
was greatly overlooked in the
planning of the just concluded
Gate’s lectures. I am sure that
many will agree ihqt a great
part of But education here at
Grinnell is to take full advant-
age of not only our classroom
situations, but the opportunities
we‘havc to |earn through extra-
curricular activities as well.
One of the most valued of these
is the Gates Lectures, which
were Outstanding this year.

I think it is a shame and a
great error that something was
not done about the scheduling
of ‘exams during this thicc' day
period; and especially the one
scheduled at 10:00 am. on Tues»
dayithe time of the third lec-
ture. It seems to me that the
professors could have waited a
day or two and given us the
opportunity to attend these lec—
tures.

I speak for myself, and i am
sure many others too, in saying
that I had an hour exam Tuess
day (at the scheduled lime of
the lecture) and one Wednesday,
so I was unable in attend Mon—
day evening's or either of Tucs-
day‘s lectures.

This all leaves me Very conJ,
fused as to what We as students'
are supposed to do: I lam here
to get a well-rounded educa-l
tion not just classroom know-l
ledge, yet, in order to ccmdinl
i must pass my hour‘
exams (and also,be there at thsl
time of the test), Consequently,‘
I must therefore sacrifice the
other educational opportunities. l.

l sincerely hope that in lhcl
future this will be taken into-
consideration by the administra-
tion.

Sincerely, i
