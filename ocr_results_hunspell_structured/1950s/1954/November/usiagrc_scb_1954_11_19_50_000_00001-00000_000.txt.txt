Freshmen Choose
“Dream Girl" Sal.

The "Freshman Dream Girl"
will be crowned Saturday, No-
vember 27, at the Freshman
dance, the lirst in a series of
class parties to be held this
year. The party will be held
from 8:30 to 12 pm in the
women's gym, and only fresh
men may attend.

The “Dream girl" contest is
now being held, with each
men's hall nominating a candi~
date. These candidates will be
voted on by all freshmen who
attend the dance.

Plans are now being formed
to hold other class parties later
in the year.

In a letter to the Student
Council. Evelyn Gardner, Chain
man of the Personnel Board,
said “The Board is studying
with increased interest this rule
and shall reach a decision in
the spring about the policy for
the next college year.

“In the meantime we feel that
the present rule protects stu-
dents and faculty from the de-
pressing experience of attend-
ing classes from which many
students would be absent just
before and after the Thanks-
giving, Christmas, and spring
Vacations.”

The Thanksgiving holiday will
be voted upon by the complete
faculty as a part of next year’s
academic calendar before the
end of this semester. The next
meeting of the faculty is on
December 6, but it is undeterm»
ined whether the calendar will
be discussed at that time.

Dean of'the College Homer .
Norton said yesterday, “The
question of a Thanksgiving holi~
day is an annual one ,discussed
by the faculty when they make
out the academic calendar each
year. if a Thanksgiving vacation
were reinstituted, we would
have to make up the time lost:
there is a variety of ways in
which this could be done.

”I don’t thing the present
system is too severe. It is size
tremely disruptive of work to
have a long vacation three
weeks before Christmas, which
sometimes develops into a week
of absences.

“However, I recognize the
need for a vacation prior to the
Christmas vacation. it is a prob-
lem which all schools face."

The present rule which states
that triple cuts will be given
for the last meeting of a class
before a holiday and the first
meeting of a class following the
holiday was instituted three
years ago upon recommendation
of the Student Council. The
penalty prior to this was a $5
fine.
