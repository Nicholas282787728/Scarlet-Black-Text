The Rams of Cornell proved
no match for the rampaging
Grinnell harriers as coach E. Gr

Saturday,

It was all Gl'lnnell over the
rolling hills of the Ram 3-mile

ably assume the role of dark—

However the results of the
Lawrence—Carleton meet last
weekend, which are not known
at this writing, should be a good
indication of the two teams’reia-
tive strength. The Viking run—
ners were in poor shape when
they were beaten here 20-33 by
the Grimell septet.

In order to prepare for the
flat ssmiie conference course at
