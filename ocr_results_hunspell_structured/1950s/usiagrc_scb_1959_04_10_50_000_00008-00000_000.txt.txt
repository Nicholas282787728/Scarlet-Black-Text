Warm, sunny weather has
enabled all the halls to have

considered by many to be the

however, the‘rest oi the Gates

a question mark

Langan has a number of
capable freshmen and may be
the darkhorse in this year's
campaign. North Younkcr is
having considerable success in
pro-season games; however,
this is not always an accurate
forecast of things to come in
the regular season, clark lost ‘
a number of men through
graduation, while Cowles has i
almost the entire team return- l
ing from last year. South
Smith luld nibble are also in
the rebuilding stage this year,
so very little can be told of
their relative strength this
early in the season.

,Dorm Policy
Cont, from p, 2

Mr. Ludwig said that most of
the alumni felt that their dor-
initory life, on North or South
campus, had contributed a
great deal to their college ex-
i pcrlcncc and therefore should
‘ not he abolislledr

It is an open qubslion, 0
course, as to whether alternatc
mcn’s and women's dorms would
destroy/this “valuable expel‘ls
‘cncc," but, possible or not, i
would irot solve. the problem of
privacy for dates.

Ludwig pointed out that an-
othcr suggestion that juniors
and seniors live~>aﬂ campus
would not be feasible simply
because, [or ﬁnancial reasons.
all dorms must be filled—and
this would be impossible with
one half of the student body
living of: campus,

It was brought to the. atten
tion of the coffee hour panel
that open dorin systems have
been working successfully at
Harvard, Princeton, Brandeis
M.I.T. and Yale for years.

At present it seems that
there is no middle ground be-
tween open lounges (which
have worked quite well) and
open dol’nlsr To me, a gladuali
cautious exploring of open
dorms would consist of a. one-
hour period (11 to 12, per-
haps) on one or two week-
end nights, If a couple or
group could only spend one
hour in a dormitory, it is un-
likcly that a llolirdater would
he inconvenienced or that
“difﬁcult situations" would
arise.

Further. the fact that every
one has to be out one—half hour
before hours would be conducivt
to 'cveryone‘s arriving at Mn
1 If a restricte
plan like the former worked a
well as open lounges have, then
would ,he no reason not t
abolish the restrictions

It would be unfortunate
midwestern conservatism, com
pounded with Iowa puritanisin
would interfere with what 1
college community from th
ages of 13 to 21 desire almos
unanimously.
