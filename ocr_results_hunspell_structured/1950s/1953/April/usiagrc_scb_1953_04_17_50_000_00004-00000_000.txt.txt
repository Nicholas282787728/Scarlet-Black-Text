by George Drake

' l
You may remember Ralphl
Mottingby as the man in thel
cage, who issued all your athel
letic equipment. You might rerv
member him as the man who
frightened you out of your wits
at the, Carleton basketball game
last February by climbing 'ontol
an unsteady ladder atop a 1.0er
ering scaﬁold to replace a burnr ,
ed out light. 1
in any event you will tar
member "Ralph," as he is ,
known thy those who patronize l
Darby's locker rooms. To them i
he’s become as much a part ;
ot Grinnell as the Minneapo- l
lis and St. Louis railroad ,
tracks. , . 1
Born in 1890, Ralph moved to
a farm near Grinneli in load.-
ror the past seven years he has
been in charge or the equipment
room, and the maintenance of
Darby gym, He probably works
longer hours than anyone on the
college payroll; he starts at
7:30 a.m, and leaves after all‘
the athletic practices are over,‘
around 7:00 pm. Any sports
event in the gym requires his
attendance, which entails work
ing many nights,

Tutor's Relays
Open Grinnell's
Outdoor Season

The Grinnell college track
team will open its outdoor sea-
son tomorrow at the thirtieth
annual Iowa Teachers Relays,
held at Cedar Falls. ‘

More than ten schools will
compete in the meet, among
lthem such teams as Bradley,
lwinner of the Central A.A.U.,
Wheaten, iowa Teachers, and
Dubuque.

Grinnell’s Terry Ellis returns
to the meet to defend his'shot
put championship or two years
standing. other place winners
for Grinnell last year were the
sprint medley relay', second;
Sam Petroff, fourth in the jav-
eli and Ellis, fourth in the
discus.

This year Grinnell will have
entries in the sprint medley re.
llay. 880 relay, 440 relay, and
the mile relay.

' Coach EC, Booth plans to
enter Clint Bennett, Chuck
Dunham, Gardiner Dutton, Ellis,
Clyde Greene, Frank Hays, Bud
Heusner, Jim Kingiand, Bob
iLandls, .Sam Petroff, Nick Ryan.‘

college much money." \

Coach \Piitsch agreed, say»
ing that "by his very enicient
management, malph saves the
school two to nitrate thousand
dollars per school year. He is
the mrnerstone of our pro-
gram."

But it isn’t the fact that Ralph
works long hours that makes
him such a landmark. Ralph has
an undying interest in athletics‘
and athletes.

Coach Simone added that it
is ironic’al that Ralph, who
works at every athletic event,
is unable to see any of them,
because he onust work while
the games are being played.
Thus Ralph counts, as the
biggest "thrill” ot his life, the
trip he ‘took to Coe with the
football team last fall to see ai
game.
