Cagers Plunge To Third, Faco Monmouth’Next‘

Cornell's revenge minded hoop—i
sters oiitreboundcd and outsliot
Griiinell to race past the Pier
neers, 92—79, at Cornell last
Tuesday. The loss dropped Grin
nail to third spot in the Mid»
west conference hehind leading
Carleton and second place Coin
nell.

Last Friday the Pioneers built
up a big early lead and then
withstood a second half rally by-
Coe to slip by the Kohawks,
77772, on the local court. Wart.
burg had ended a four game
Grinnell winning streak the pl'er
vious weekend by clouting the
Pfitschmen. 71 to 53. at Waverly.

Cornell took an early lead over

the Pioneers and never once re.
linquished it as they steadily
pulled farther and farther ahead
of Grinnell for the first three
quarters of the game. Only in
the last .period were the Pio-
neers able to outscore the Rams,
33-28, but by then the gap was
'too big to close.

The game was a big disap»
nointmeiit for some 100 Grin-‘
noll fans who traveled to ML
Vernon for the contest which
could have given the Pioneers
a first place tie with Carleton.
Big Bob Winter registered the

‘sonai fouls which he was charged;

the same Coe squad which Grim
ncll outlasted a week ago.

Both teams have a high
geared offense. Monmouth
boasts the second best offensive
record in the conference, while
Grinncll has the best field
gun] average.

Coach John Pfitsch sees the _
game as a battle between Grin-
nell’s height and Monmouth’s
speed. He looks for Monmouth
to employ a pressing defense,
counting on depth and speed.

Grinnell will have a decided
height advantage as the tallest
Monmouth regular stands 6 ft.
31/2 inches. All the rest of the
regulars are around 6 ft., with
the exception of 5 ft. 6 in. guard
Ray Brooks.

\ Brooks along with o- it. 1
in. guard Ray Kovaks sparks
the Scots‘ scoring attack.

Kovaks is fifth in the con-
ference scoring race with 16.3
point average, while Brooks
is seventh with 15.7 points
per game. ,

Kovaks was an all Conference
guard Selection last year, when
he collected 350 points in 20
games. Piitsch calls Kovaks “a
very good driver, will) Collects
a lot of fools from opposing
players." ‘
