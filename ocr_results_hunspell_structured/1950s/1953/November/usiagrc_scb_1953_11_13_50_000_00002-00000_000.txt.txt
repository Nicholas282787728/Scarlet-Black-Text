The. Gray Policy

Taking another semi-solid stand on the car and drink-
ing rule penalties this week, Dr. Stevens announced that
punishment for such violation continues to be a semester
suspension. He stated that the purpose of the penalty is
to control action rather than punish violators —— something
which couldn‘t be accomplished by starting with a first
offense penalty and increasing its severity.

But on what other grounds than a minimum imaxi-
mum basis did the Administration found their action in
first ‘reprimanding’ a student known to have a car on
campus, and then later suspending him as a two-time
violator?

Five strong criticisms of recent action of the college’s
Administrators have been presented to Dr. Stevens in a
letter from the C of HP, reprinted elsewhere in this issue,
All of the criticisms seek consistency in an excessively
strong policy verbally supported by the Administration,
and refuted this week by four drastically lightened suspen-
SIODS.

The rule as it flow stands is exactly the same as it was
presented to the student body this fall — at least it‘s the
same theoretically. Actually, it is an open charge of which
you can free yourself by presenting some intangibles
classified as "extenuating circumstances" which are sup-
posed to be sufficient reason for a softer penalty.

Until these “circumstances” are completely clarified,
and a uniform policy is presented, drinkingr and car pos-
session offenses will continue to be arbitrarily settled by
a subjective evaluation, entirely unfair to non-Violators.

Letters To The Editor

(Editor's note: Copies of this letter were sent to Dean rullcr,
Dean Gardner, Dean Brown, Dr. Norton, Student Council and
chairman of the Board of Trustees.)

November ll, 1953
Dr, Samuel N. Stevens
Grinnell College
Gtinnell, Iowa
Dear Sir:

We are taking this opportunity to state the Council of House
Presidents position concerning the recent actions on the enforce-
ment and adjudication of the “czlr rule”. The Administration an-
nounced at the beginning of the school year that the penalty for
keeping a car while at Grinncll was suspension for the remainder
of the semester in which the infraction was discovered. A large
portion of the student body felt punishment did not fit the
“crime", but acted with the knowledge that if the rule were
broken, the penalty would be inflicted. in fact, at the time of
registration, each student signed a pledge card showing his
knowledge of the rule and his willingness to live by it.

For the first two and one—half months, in each Case where
there was an infraction of the car rule, the full penalty was
exacted. Now, in the past week, several startling reversals have
taken place on the port of the Administration, Specifically, two
cases in which the full punishment was levied, and then reduced,
from the original semester suspension to a three week period.
The penalties were reduced, without the knowledge of, or ex-
planation to either the C of HP or the student body, because of
‘alleged “extenuating circumstances". 5

The Administration has always stressed to the Council thsti
two of the most important factors in government of any kind were
non-snbjectlve judgment in all cases and consistency. Obviously.
in their actions of the past week, the Administration has been,
false to their own standards of “effective government".

So far, there have been three Cases of car rule violations.
Now, two of the three men lnvolved have been reinstated with
three week suspensions. The third man has not been treated in
the same manner. in spite of the alleged circumstances that make
it possible (at least in the eyes of the Administration) for one
man to have a car and be suspended for a semester, and for two
men to break the same rule and return after three weeks, we
feel there is-a serious injustice and a definite inconsistency on
the part of the upper cchclon of Grinnell's governmental setup.

As the governing body on North Campus, we feel that: 1) the
student body has lost all respect for the rule as it now stands, 2)

 

and although they lived a full life, it was not a long one.
They were overloaded, badly used, and forced to endure
the repair attempts of amateur mechanics.

This time let’s treat the machines with respect.

MOURNERS

A fable:

Onceupon a time there was
a bunch of gods on top of Mt.
Olympus. They were a sort of
crack drill squad; when one of
them did a left face they all
did a left free. But not really,
most of the time they would go
marching off in all directions.

Then one time they were all
in formation and the general
called an about face and some
of them did a to-thesleft-flank
instead. The result was sort of a
multiple two-faced situation.

Then they all tried to figure
out why it happened so they
could sacrifice the person re-
sponsible and feel good again.
Then they realized that the rea»
son was that everybody was used
to calling his own signals and
nobody knew who the general
was.

Consequently a baldheaded
man called Zeus said that from
now on black and white would
be called gray. This clarified the
situation; the squadron com—
manders went over the hill and
the other gods shut the heck up.

Of course they were used to
going off in all directions so
the next day it would probably
be just like it was before.

The moral of the story is:
don’t count your suspensions
until they’re hatched.

However, you have to re
member that these gods can
move pretty fast and you Can‘t
always keep up with them. rm

 

the student body notified of the Change in policy.

‘days about moral values, high

We hear a great deal nowa-

Standards and the like. Also
Grinnell college is justly proud
M its Christian atmosphere,
which is stressed ip many ways
and brought to the‘ “Mention of
the Student body. Such an idea
of “fan", ns-shown in the pars
trayal to which 1 ieferled pre-
Vrously, is, indeed, not a sad
reflection on the College and
what it tries to teach the student
body but, rather on the upper-
classmen who orginated the idea.

 

Sincerely yours,

To the editor: ‘,

There appear to bc tllreel
types of hell d'ay costumes, First,
the kind that illustrates good'
clean fun, secondly the typel
that asks the question as to
what good Clean fun is, and
lastly, the example of an incon-
siderate attitude and plain bad;
taste.

We desire to say a word on
the last type, not aiming at any,
personalities, but at the general
principal involved. Seeing some _
one required to dress as Jesusl
Christ, standing in front of the:
chapel carrying nblack cross,
surely was not in keeping with
either sane judgment, fore-
thought, or plain cdmmon sense.
Shouldn't we again look at the
following motto which is i-
corpoiatcd in the Grinnoll sea
“Christa Dune,” meaning "Christ
leads?”

We don’t intend to preach a
sermon with long faces but
hope in the future that mocking
humorous hell dry costumes will
keep within their own bound-
aries.
