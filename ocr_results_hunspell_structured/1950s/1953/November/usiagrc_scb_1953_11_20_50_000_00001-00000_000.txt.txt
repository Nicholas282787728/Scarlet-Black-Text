Kathy Hampton and Helen or ,
spn defeated the Main affirm-
ative team of Mary Waters and

The plan would establish the
Student Council as the sole leg-
,islative power of campus govA
ernment, and would include the

,League Board and C of H? as

administrative units. It also
would include several changes in
the election procedures for prese
idents ot the two groups: elect—
ing a c of HP president from
north 'campus at large (in addi-
tion to the individual hall pres-
idents), and moving the eleci
tion date of the League Board
president to the time of semese
ters.
Opposition by the two
groups centered on the argue
ments that most problems are
not campus wide, and thus
should_not fall within a cen-
tral legislative agcn ; and
that certain specific details
such as the election changes-
were unacceptable to them.
Both groups voiced approval
of the “appeal court" principle
advocated by Perry in his elec—
tion campaign of last year.

Perry'decl’ared that he didn't
“know what will be done about
the unification" of the three
groups, but Noe stated that “In
spite of the,set~back, the com-
mittee plans to continue work-
ing on some plan for unification
of the constitutions.”

Both groups felt that the
plan proposed would have
changed the written constitu-
tions but would have left at-
tual functions of the three
governmental agencies un—

changed,

The League Board and C of
HP have scheduled a joint
meeting next Tuesday to dis-
cuss therproblems of student
government.
