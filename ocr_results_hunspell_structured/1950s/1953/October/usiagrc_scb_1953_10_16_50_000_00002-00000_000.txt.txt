Take Note ‘ "‘

This is United Nations Week, and the timely poll con-
ducted by the League of Women Voters shows one sur»
prising fact: most students know little or nothing about
the international organization.

If this were 1923 that wouldn't be too surprising, for
the United States was then effectively forgetting every-
thing but Prohibition and Teapot Dome.

But this is 1953, and the free world we lead is faced
with the hydrogen bomb and a menacing itussia. Our gov-
ernment has recognized the situation, and has led in the
establishment of the UN. As both citizens and students,
we at Gl‘innell should know more about the UN than the
poll indicates.

Ten student organizations and the Institute of Inter-
national Affairs have combined to present a program this
week which could add‘to our understanding. Each event on
the program should draw a large crowd. .

Dean Fuller has given the Student Council an excellent
offer in answer to the petition which the council endorsed
last week. It should lead to mutual understanding and
trust. '

But it’s difficult to see why the procedure for dis-
cussion that he suggests shouldn’t be a normal procedure
before changes are made — not just after.

To the editor:

it has come to my attention
that students are greatly cone
cerned over the possibility that
grades in Air Science courses
may be handled differently.
Some reference was made to
this in your editorial of last
week.

i have talked with
Commanding Officer
Executive Officer of
Force unit. I believe
are these:

1. The work in Air Science
courses are divided into units
which do not precisely correSe
pond to our semester. The Air
Force procedures established by
the Air University provide an
elaborate mathematical system
for evaluating work in each
unit in proportional parts so
that a grade for the semester
may be determined.

2. The number symbols used
in this calculation do not neces-
sarily correspond to the num-
ber grades used on ouriformer
grading system. They might
more properly be called “raw
Scores."

3. The Air Force has assured
me that it is their intention
and desire to follow precisely
the grading system which was
established by the faculty for
use at Grinnell College.

I feel that I can honestly
give the student body every
assurance that the letter grades
on our newly established grade,

This democracy stuff can go
too far. Pretty soon we Grin-
nellians will be just like other
people. r'rinstance: when I came
here Grinnell catalogues as-
sured me that ”every meal is
a social experience." But today
i was reading what a fellow
named Hocking sai : “Meals
become social occasions largely
because of their democracy; eats
ing is the confession of a neces-
ity before which all ranks have

to bow." Come to think of it,
though, it's hard to avoid social
experiences unless you never
leave your room. I'm disillus-

in view of some student and
faculty misunderstanding about‘
the manner in which the exam-‘
ination in Christian Origins this,
fall was scored, the followingl
statement is made: i

l.The raw score used as a
cut—off point (63 conrect ans-
wers out of a possible 100)
is exactly the same as last
Year.

2. The decilc ranking done
by the testing office put every
score over the nintieth per—
centile into the ninety-ninth
percentile. This gave some 14
students who got slightly less
than 64 in the raw Score, the
same percentile ranking as the
13 who made 64 or more
correct answers.

Eric Allen, north Younker

good purpose. Not only does itl

, but it is useful as an informar

countries of the world and
therefore helps promote better
understanding among countries

Don Brooks, Gates sophomore:
