Prexy Speaks
During Convo

Wednesday

President Samuel N. Stevens,
speaking at the first convocation
of the year Wednesday in Darby
gymnasuim, asserted that “we,
as students and teachers, m/ust
recoigniize that there is no time
ior Selirsatlsfaction, for passive,
almost negative. exploitation of
educational opportunity."

“The idea that we are going
on easily and surely toward
more and more progress as a
guarantuod fact of human histr
ory is not true," he added.

“I should like id suggest that
Iwe do away with the easy cyni-
cism and the easy optimism
which have retarded real human
growth; that we discover the
fine technique of being tempted
by the good rather than the evil;
and that we live by faithfulness
rather than by hope of reward,”
Stevens said,

Speaking alter an introduc-
tion by President Stevens,
Student Council president
Roger Perry rcasscrted the
need for a unified constitution
of student government, which
he proposed last spring.

He declared that definite res
lationships must be developed
between the League Board,
Council of House Presidents, and
the Student Co‘tmcil.

l>erry also renewed his sup-
port or an all-college council,
which he advocated in his cam-
paign last March. Noting the
shift of north campus drink-
ing rule responsibility to the
administration from the c oi
HP, he declared the council,
as an appeal board, was more
necessary than beiore.

Under his proposal last spring,
the all college council would
consist of representativa from
the various agencies of student
government, representatives of
the student body, and members
of the Board df Trustees, ad
ministration, and raculty.

The orinncll high school
band under the direction of
Charles Luckenbill, played the
processional and recessional,
and Hoylc Carpenter played
the piano accompaniment for
the Grinnell Hymn.

Perry welcomed old and new
students to the campus, and the
invocation was given by Dean of
the Chapel Winston L. King.

Three Promotions
For Faculty Told

Raises in rank for three face
ulty members were announced
recently by President Samuel N.
Stevens.

Mrs. Ruth Ma-ttila (education),
Madge Phillips (physical edu-
cation). and Henry G. Weston
(biology) have been promoted to
assistant professorships fmm the

 

ranks of instlmetdls.

 

was given first. Gillette and
President Stevens have 'been
friends for over twenty years.

”I have an abiding concern
for the wellrbeing of our coun—
try," President Stevens said
yesterday. “I am tremendously
interested in seeing to it that
lowa, through its elected repre-
sentatives, gives intellectual and
political leadership to the Con-
gress.

“However, I have no politi—
cal aspirations. And it’s un-
likely that any substantial
group of the people of Iowa
would want a representative
in the Senate who—regard—
less of his party alfiliation—
would iunction as an indepen—
dent in making his decisions,
considering what he considers
the country’s good."

Stevens has had govern-
ment experience as adviser to
several Senate committees
and has been well-known as
a labor mediator.

President Stevens was con-
sidered as a possible candidate
to run against Republican Sen—
ator Bourke B. Hickenlcoper in
1950 by many liberal Republi-
cans and conservative Demo-g
crats, but turned down offers of
support because of the Candis
tions at Grinnell. At that time
the college was anticipating the
decline of the enrollment which
is taking place last year and
this year; and Stevens decided
to remain at Grinnell.

”Since then," he said, “I
have isolated myself from or-
ganized politics in the state."

President Stevens has been
a Democrat for many years.
in 1948 he helped organize
President Truman‘s successiul »
Iowa campaign. When Tru—
man‘s campaign train crossed
Iowa, President Stevens hoard-
cd it at Davenport and re—
mained aboard until Truman
lcit the state to go further
west.

In 1952, however, President
Stevens supported Dwight D.
Eisenhower, despite his Demo—
cratic afﬁliation. He loves, hon.
ors, and respects Adlai Steven—
son, he said, but he felt that
a change in the administration
was needed.

For this reason he doesn't 139‘
lieve “there’s a Chance in the
world of the Democratic organi—
zation accepting me as a candi—
date.”

Mills quoted Gillette as say-

ing “any one oi these would be
a strong candidate.”
