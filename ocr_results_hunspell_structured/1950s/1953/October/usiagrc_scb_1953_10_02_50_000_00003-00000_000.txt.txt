Student Council
Urges Big Band
For Christmas

A formal recommendation was
made to the social. calendar come
mittee that the Christmas for-
mal be declared a no-flowel'
dance, and that the money
usually spent on Corsages should
be used to obtain a big-name
band' through the sale of $2 to
$2.50 tickets.

After hearing a very favor-
able summary of several recent
surveys concerning Grinneli
faculty salaries-in relation to
similar schools’ salaries, the
council voted to send a letter of

commendation to President
Stevens and the Board of Trus~
tees, applauding Grinnell’s high
rating and expressing the hope
that it continue to rise.

Applications for producer of
the student musical should be
handed to Roger perry by next
Thursday, listing the applicant's
background and qualifications.
The producer will be the gen-
eral manager of the entire mu.
sical staff.
