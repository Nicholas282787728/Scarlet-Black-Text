Minnesota Whips Pioneers
In Non-LeagueTilt 146-0

by Roger Yost

Grinncll College isn't pl'imcu'r
ily known for its athletic squads,
but nevertheless. it has quite a
history as far as the grid spoi‘f
is concerned.

Some 65 years ago, in the
foil or 1889, Gi-inncll‘s varsity
elcvcn journeyed to Iowa City
to play the University oi lowa
in the first football game wcst
of the Mississippi, During
that history making event,
Grinnell, at that timc known
as lowa college, defeated the
llawkeycs by a 24-0 score.

Although the “Pioneers” of
lowa football had many a good
season in the decades to follow,
they have never once gone un»
defeated through a season’s
schedule as they did lback in
'89 whcn they whipped the
Hawkcyes in their only contest
of the ycar.

Rough and Tumble

The Scarlet and Black jersey»
ed Pioneers opened the next
season with the University of
lowa, now a member of the Big
10 Conference, and whipped
thorn in a rough and tumble
contest, (the equipment used
during the early days of/‘toot-
ball left much to be desired),
14.6.

In thcir only other game oi
the 1890 season, the Univer—
sity of Minnesota edged out
.thc gridsters from Griiinell
18s”, to providc the Pionecrs
with their. first deical. in
football historyu of course
there wcrc quite a few more
losses that lollowcd the Min-
nesota setback, but the vic<
torics were 'nearly equal. 0n
entrance to this, Grinnell’s
65th grid season, the Pioneers
have compiled a record of
209 victories, 220 losses, and
zz tics.

Some of the other big-name
football teams that the Pioneers
ran up. against one time or an
other were Michigan State,
(1933—37); the Universities -oi
Nebraska and Washington dur~
ing the 1920's; Colorado college
and Drake University up until

dropped a contest to the prep
schools.

mentors, there have been sev—
