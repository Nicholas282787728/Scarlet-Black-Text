AppropospHomecoming Play
IThe Male Animal‘ En’rerl'alns

by Chuck Haynes

_ The Grinllellpcollege theatre opened its season Thursday night
with a homecoming show by James Thurber and Elliott Nugcnt
that couldn't have been more appropriate ll someone on the campus

had written it.
Kent Andrews and a mixed

cast of experienced and inexpel‘»

iellced players managed to arouse the “Male Anlmal" in most of
the male members of the audience and a Certain amount of syl
pathy for Larry Robinson as professor Tommy Turner in the oppo»

site sex.

In a play dealing with the gaity and contusion of homecoming
and a much more sober problem of the teaching rights of a college
educator, the cast mixed the two into an enjoyable evening oi

dramatic entertainment.

No single standout can be'
picked from the cast, for all

the actors turned in convincing
performances.

Larry Robinson handled his
role of Professor Turner rwith
whimsical ease and was at his
best when playing opposite Jim
Stewart as “whirling” Joe For»
guson.

Stewart, who took over the
part only a little more than a
week ago, was a bright, brash
returning tootball hero and his
self»con1i‘dent Joe Ferguson con»
trasted nicely with the quiet
demeanor at Robinson's Tommy
Turner.

Diane Thompson showed a
clear insight into the role of
Tommy’s wife with a mind of
her own and two men on herl
mind.

Barbara Farries sparkled as
the younger sister Pat ywho
skillfully 'iuggled her relationr
ships with the handsome half»
back, played well by Dan Taft.
and Allen Harrison, who turns
ed in a smooth performance as

 

"the unconiused liberal" Michael
Barnesk

Leigh Grosnick was excellent
as the hardheadcd trustcc,
Keller.

In minor roles, Marty Kelly,
Davida Goldman, Hull Poth-
oven, and Audrey Gahl helped
to keep the show blithe and
bubbling.

Chuck Windsor made the
most of his minor role of Dr.
Damon and showed keen obserr
vaticn in his portrayal of the
staunch and sometimes acid
professor.
