Although an avalanche of Fire-season speculation assured Grin-
nell’s cagers that they are unbeatable, Someone forgot 10 tell this
[Cl Central. Bothered by overconfldence and ovel'eagerness, the
Pioneers gol worse as the game mm on.

This opening defeat may well be tile best thing that could
have hrppcried w the cagers. Not only will il remove much of
the unhealthy pressure which has been placed 011 "the Plilsch-
men, hut also it has undoubtedly made them realize that the
“lad ahead is going to he lull of big stones, not little pebbles
that can be shoved aside with the press notices that too eager
Grinnell fans have been shoving into the players’ hands.

Those people who see visions of a conference championship
for Grinnell apparently don"t like to face Cold. hard facts. Here
are some of the problems facing Coach Piifsch:

L Grinnell has less JEﬁtErmen Than any other tam in U18
league.

2. Of these ﬁve lettermen one. Don Hagar, is not a regular,
anddwo others are not ready for full-time action. Bud Crow]
hasn’t played :yel due to an injured knee, and Dick von Maui-
hasn’t fully adjusted himself from the grldiron ('0 the hardcoutt.

3. A fourth letterman, Tom Railsback, becomes ineligible at
filament] of the semester With no top-notch replacement in
Si; .

l There is little reserve strength 10 back up the starting
quintet ' ‘4"..-

Although this sounds pretty gloomy, lhc Pioneers do have
the polenlial lo develop inlo a holler than average squad. If prob-
lel'ns two and three iron out successfully, the local cagers should
give their fans some victories to cheer about before the season
ends. But the wins Won‘t come easy, and they won’t come every
weekend. S 0 S

Although Iowa Slalc is certainly much stronger lhan Cen—
lrsl, Griuuoll will give lhc Cyclones a holler balllc than it gave
lhe nulchmen. will. cockiness replaced by determination, and
Coach Pillsch's promise lhis morning lhcl Bud Crowl will see
some aclion, lhe Pioneers should make the game incorcsling.
I’ll pick Iowa Slate by 14 going. 5

I wish that I could say somclhing nicc aboul Ron Frank. bum
his accomplishments oulweigb anything that lhis bungling writer
could say wilhoul sounding corny, so I‘ll keep quiet.

Cagers Tangle With-Cyclones

Grinncll’s hoopstel‘s move into Big Seven competition
when ,they meet Iowa State College at Ames tomorrow
night. It mzlrks Iowa State’s opener, and Gl'innell‘s first
tussle since last week's upset loss to Central.

lowa State, in lhc midsl of 3‘
Coaching upheaval, lost its two
high scorers oi lusl year, but
has lhrce regulars returning.
Coach Chick Sutherland will
probably slarl his outstanding
boy. Carl Van Cleave al guard,
and lasl year’s second slring
center, rugged Chuck Duncan.
Duncan is 5’5”, Van Cleave 6'3".
The iorward posls will probably
go lo Jerry Davis, 6', and Don
DeKosler, 6’4", while 6’ Larry
Wetter opens as the other
guard.

no advantage in lhal deporl—
menl over lhe Pioneer squad.
ISO is speedy and early season
pruclice seems to indicale a
sharp-shooting quinlcl for the
Cyclones.

Iowa State won the last con-
lcst between lhc lwo learns,
when lbey lripped up the Pio-
neers 70.59 back in 1950.

Probable starters for Grinncll
will be captain Bob Winter at
center; Dick van Maur and
John Mussel‘ at the forward
slols; and Tom Railsback and
Bob Landis or Mark Schooler
as guards.

string guard berth by the Associated Press, Frank ranked
higher than any other Iowa small college player.

Thus Frank must be rated
as the best Gl'innell gridde'l‘
