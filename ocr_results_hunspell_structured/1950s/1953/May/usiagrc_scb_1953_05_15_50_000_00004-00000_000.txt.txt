The Grinnell linksmen ended
their dual season with an even
split with two oi the best
teams in iowa, The Pioneers up;
set a hlghlystouled lows Teach—
ers squad, 3-7. Then the home
team were guests to the lowa
State Cyclones who rolled over
the Pionaei‘s with little trouble,
lath—21o. This gave the Pioneers
a dual meet recoicl of four
wins and three losses.

The pioneers arc in Gales-
liui-g, ill, today and tomorrow
for the annual Midwestern con.
ference meet. The host team,
Knox, is favored to retain their
title Grim-tell is expected to
finish high in the meet.

Representing Grinnell in the
meet are Bill Laztel‘, pets Smith,
Hep Miller, Tom Railsback and
John Hammer.

The Pioneers traveled to Wale
erloo to give the Teachers a
surprise beating. Hap Miller was
the meet .medalist with a 78
over the flat Brynes park
course, which is Hap's home
course. Every Pioneer was a
point getter in the biggest event
of the year for the Pioneers.

Against lowa State, a Big
Seven conference power, it was
completely a diitercnt story as
the Cyclones tore the Grinnell
links apart. Pete Smith was the
only Pioneer to come close to
victory as he tied his man. Dick
Webher was medalist with an
even par, 72. McGuiness and
Platt had 74 apiece; Bob Lee
playing seventh for the staters
registered a 75, It was a long
afternoon for the Pioneers.

in a coaches' poll taken re-
cently, the teams given the best
chance of dethroning Knox in
today’s league meet were Carle—
ton, Lawrence, and Ripon. The
other five golf teams were rated
in the following order. St. Olaf
5th, Grinnell 6th, Corneu 7th,
Monmouth ath. and Coe, 9th.

Grinnell has beaten hotli Coe
and Cornell in dual meets, but
lost decisively to Knux’s champs
earlier this season.
