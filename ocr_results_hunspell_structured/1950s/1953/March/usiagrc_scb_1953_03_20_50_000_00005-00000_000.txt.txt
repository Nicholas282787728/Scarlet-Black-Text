Truesclale Recalls Coaching Pioneers

TotCage Wins

by Dick Gardner,

“when I first canie to Grin-
iicll," John,Trucsdale‘ remark:
ed, ”my aim was to promote
leadership and interest in the,
athletic program at Giinnell,
both on the level of varsity and
intramural competition." To a
great extent his objectives have
been achieved

Tluesdalc, now chairman of
the physical .education depart—l

ment, and supervisor at the
nolth campus intramural pro—
gram, arrived in Grinnell in

1927. He was immediately model
a professor of physical ed a-
tion and soon afterwardshp-l
pointed head coach of the
neer varsity cagc squad, and
'also freshman football coach,
At the time of Truesdale’sl
basketball coaching career, Grins]
ncll competed in the old;
Missouri Valley conference.
Other members of the confer-
ence were Drake, Creightonl
Tulsa, Washington university of
St. Louis, Washburn.

 

  

M, .
Noting the type of schools
with which Grinnell played,

Truesdale Said: “Our boys were}
really in a class of very good
athletic schools, and the pector-
mance of the Grinncll athletes
was tremendous. Athough we‘
never finished higher than sec-l,
ond place in the league basket-
ball racc during my Coachingl
days, our school had the l‘quV‘
tatlon of being the big upsettersl
in the usual tight Conferencel
iacc

Truesdalc has one very ex-
ceptional record as a haskct-,.
hall coach, that being his
teams‘ exceptional pertor— l
mances against the Oklahoma
Aggies, long considered onc
of the finest basketball squads
in the country. During a‘
stretch of twelve gnmcs against
the Oklahomans, Grinnell won ,
half of them, a feat which no .
other college coach in the
nation can claim.

Leaving the field of varsity!
athletics in 1939, Truesdale,
turned to a very important task

 

and. track.

tor of the intramural activities
of Grinnell's men.

Although ,Truesdale doesn't
prefel intramulal work to
coaching Varsity athletics. he
has found “equal satisfaction in

both ficlds' He points out one
notable advantage for intra-
murals: “In M games ,1 al-

He doesn’t care who wins the
intramural battles, just as long
as thc‘ boys “have fun and play
,_a good game." It is by observ-
ing these games that Truesdale
idel'ivcs one of the greatest sat-
isfactions of his work7watch.
ing boys blossom out as students

: and athletes.

However, he strongly feels'
that the progress a boy makcs

after 7 graduation is much
more important than the
“number of touchdowns or

free throws he scores in col-
loge." Silent witnesses to the
fact that Truesdalc keeps in
touch with his students after
they leave college arc the
letters, pictures,
and newspaper clippings which
he can show you from fol--
mer pupils reporting to him

ways win. My teams never lose."l

 

of their new activities.

His favorite occupationrbow-

is teaching the mast theolx

.courses for physical education

majors.

He declined to name any out»
standing athletes he has coached,
Since he feels that “the style or
play has changed So much that
it is impossible to compare to»
day's athlete with the oné of
one or two decades ago.” He
thinks that the modern azhlcte
is more skilled because of his
superior training from grade
school age on, but says that the
former athletes were just as
physically tit, spirited, and de»
termined to win,

Before Tl‘uesdale became a
coach, he won letters in feats
ball, basketball and track dur-
ing his three college years at
Carleton and one at Bradley
university.

No student, whether ho has
known Truesdale as a motes~
sor, or Seen him working long

hours, sometimes seven days a-

week, with his intramural acs

tiVlties, can tail to respect this ,. .
senior member of the untimely

college faculty.
