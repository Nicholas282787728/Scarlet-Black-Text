Concerning Policies

Recent developments concerning the S&B’s coverage
of League Board and activities on south campus have pomt-
ed up the need for clarification of our policies. A’survey of
women students conducted under our auspices, is printed
in this issue. Some comments have stated that the 5&3
should not concern itself with this south campus affair, for
it is a manner pertinent to women only

YWCA, WRA, house council elections, and even Lea-
gue Board elections generally pertain exclusively to women.
By these standards, does this mean that we should not re.
port these activities? We don’t think so, in fact, we em-
phatically state that the S&B’s policy is to report news-
worthy events at Grinnell college. This does not mean north
campus or south campus, but it means events oocuring ill
a community which encompasses both, and extends even
further.

We are not taking an editorial position on League
Board or its night monitor system, but we are strongly
asserting our rights to conduct a survey and disseminate
information concerning over 350 Grinnell'women. We shall
continue to do so.

Opera Workshop Presents
’V'Must' Campus Entertainment

By Sally Osborne

The Presentation of “The Secret of Suzanne," a gay
comic opera, and “Riders to the Sea,” the somber Synge
piece set to music, given last night and tonight by the
Opera Workshop is, in a word, good. One might wonder at
the idea of two such contrasting operas on one bill. It is

Students Desire Greater Privacy
In Dating Activities On Campus

By Mnrv Olsen

More informal recreation, less supervision, and greater
facilities for privacy are what Grinnell students feel are
lnost needed to improve dating activities on campus. Also,
steady deters are mllch more dissatisfied with the existing
activities than are casual deters and planned college dat—

not difficult to adjust, however, from the comic of the first

to the more serious lrish mood,
because this mood is set imv
mediately by. lighting, set, and
the music itself.

Working under the difficult
conditions of shortened rehearsal
time and late technical prepara-
tion, the music department with
Charles Haynes' able stage di-
rection and technical assistance
by Grinnell Players, has pulled
together a musical evening that
no Grinnellian should miss.
Credit is due Hoyle Carpenter
who took over the musical di-
rection ot the death of Duane
Crossley; posthumous praise to
Mr. Crossley who did fine work
in casting and setting up the
music and some of the staging
for the operas. It's mo bad that
those behind the scenes are not
given notice on the program —
namely Judie Reget who has
done her usual skilliul job in
costuming the show and dress-
ing the set. Also noteworthy is
the stage management of Mary
'rhormcycr, lighting of Gordon
Packard, make-up directed by
Marty Kelly, props by Nancy
Cue (who came up with a price-
less wicker tea-cart), and the
excellent work of Shirley Speels
man, accompanist,

An inexperienced student of
drama necessarily feels rather
presumptuous at taking on a
critical review oi any drolmtic
presentation, let alone a Inui-
al one. Lot it be understood,
then, that the criticism which
follows is clearly personal
and liable to error.

Wolf-Ferrari’s u'l'he Secret of
Suzanne” is bright and colorful
both in mode of presentation
and music. Haynes has used
clever blocking; at first the pace
seems too even but things pick
up along with the plot’s cir-
cumstances.

Scolty Walker gives us a
delightful Count Gil, though his
little boyish quality makes
ludicrous the program notation
“aged 30." Overlooking this and

an occasional smile that
shouldn't have been there. Scot<
ty comes through with some fine
wmic technique.

An audience has n tendency
to be slightly fearful of ﬂy-
ing china and canes, and when
the loving couple sis calmly
upon the broken china, might
feel slightly squeamish; _but
the )1qu seem to outdo the
flying Shrapnel.

Barbara Hansen has improved
tremendously. Since her first
Grinnell opera appearance in

Menotti's “Maid as Mistress"
she has gained considerable vo-
cal control and is much more
easily understood. Though her
movement on stage could he
smoother, we were impressed
with a delightfully sweet and
coquettish Suzanne. or special
note is her relaxing "smoke-
l‘lng” bit while reclining on the
chaise lounge

As Scotty Walker gave such
a lino but silent periormancc
in last year's “The Medium,"

Alan Spieler gives an equally
fine though entirely different
kind of performance as Saute,
the mute servant. His business
With the snuff and cleaning up
the broken china (with 3 hair
brush, no less!) is real side-I
slapping comedy—and his eyes
are priceless!

I think it was “11118er

Synge’s “Riders to the Sea."

almost static—the only pro-

ing activi
These were the major con-
clusions drawn from a re-
cent survey of student atti-
tudes toward existing dating
activities carried out by
Kathy Melchoirs and Mary
Olsen as a project for the
course in social psychology. In
addition to discovering and
analyzing attitudes toward clat-
ing activities. the project was
intended to give a number of
students the opportunity to ex-
press their personal vicws con-
cerning this situation and to
suggest possible improvements.

Method

Because of the particular
orientation of this project to-
ward attitudinal differences be-
tween steady and casual datel‘s,
me 60 students chosen to be in-
terviewed were divided equally
between these two groups. with
15 men and 15 women in each
group. Methods of random selec-
tion were used to pick all these
subjects.

rho questionnaire they were
asked to fill out requested
such things as how often they
usually data, how frequently
they attended various typos of
dating activities, their attitudw
toward the existing situation.
and any suggestions they had
for improving the campus dat-
‘ing activities.

Privacy

In tabulatlng the results, the
subjects were first divided into
the four categories of steady
male, steady female, casual
male, and casual female. For
further comparison these were
combined into two groups of two
categories each: all steady daters
and all casual daters, and all
men and all Women. Finally, the
data from all 60 subjects was
consolidated into one table.

Opportunity for more privacy
in dating proved beyond ques-
tion to be the greatest desire
of most students, but particu-
larly oi steady' couples. or the
168 improvements suggested, 94
were concerned with this prob-
lem. In answer to the direct
question, “Is there enough op
portunity on campus {or couples
to be alone7”, the 50 “no’s” and
only Seven "yes's" made the ans-
wel‘ quite clearr

Exces supervision was ex-
pressed by 35 people, but more
or these were slcady dntcis
(25) than casual (label‘s (11),
and more were men (26) than
women (10). The latter is pos-
sibly because men, being free
in other areas, feel supervision
more koonly than do the wo-A
men who constantly live with
it.

Such ideas as

lounges more, using Pine Tree,
expanding the Union, and other
measures for increasing facil-
itics for privacy were suggested
in 58 ways, Again the steadya
casual dissimilarity was very
striking, in that steady daters
put forth 40 of these suggestions.
Noticecbiy apparent here also
was the interesting factor that
women seem' to favor the Union
for privacy (eight of the nine
suggestions mentioning the
Union were made by women),
while men favor lounges more.
making eleven of the fourteen
suggestions in this area. Poss
sibly this is because women
feel more Confined within the
hall than they do in the Union,
while men feel less inhibited in
the lounges and more cramped
in the Union.
Informal Activities

increasing informal activities
such as informal dances, outdoor
events, all-college recreation,
and coed eating were also very
popular with many students, be-
ing mentioned so times. This
was the area of improvement in

far the most interest; apparent-
ly they feel this type of activity
best solves their problems.
Furthermore, when asked to
indicate What types of activities

formal dances and recreation,

chosen far more times than any
other activities. Study dates and

Dissatisfaction

Another interesting dis-
covery of the project was that

difference is that steady

week, while casual daters av-
erage only 1%, which also
points to greater concern with
dating problems. Other facts
which point in this direction
were that study dates and

mls and are also much more
