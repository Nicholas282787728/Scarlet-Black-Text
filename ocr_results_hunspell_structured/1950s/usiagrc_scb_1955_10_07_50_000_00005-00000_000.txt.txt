The 1955-1956 Referee Board
is a new innovation in the hist-
ory of the WRA in that it is the
first to be completely selected
and not simply volunteer. Each
member was asked to serve on
the Board, which provides offi-
cials for all Intramurals from
Septem’ber to June, because of
her ability and interest; and
each will receive special instruc-
ﬁlm from Miss Phillips and Miss
Wick before each sportl

In so changing the positions
from voluntary llo selecﬁve, it
is [hoped that the: girls will
look on them as an honor and
not out as 'a job.

These are the girls who will
serve: Katie Alppldby, Jeanne
Bannister, Gayle Baumgartner,
Joyce Buck. Earl) Eckstein, Sue
Grippen, Merg Henry. Gret
Klein, Mordy Murray, Val
Owings, Sue Peterson, Gail
Pomrehn, Carol Replogle. Jean
Stright, Judy Wells, and Jan
Wenthe.

Jean Teidemann, noose Hall
sophomore, has been named
by 1h: WRA Board as their
nmmnhﬂve ‘w the newly
formed Recreation Committee.

Despite the late start, the Vi.

year, and Max Galler and Tom

The Vike line, which will
probably outweigh Grinnell to
the man, is lacking in exper.

biggest weaknesses are at the

Grinnell, with two games al-

the game at almost full strength.
Guard Taylor Holbrook is still
bothered by a bad arm and is
the only first string absentee.
