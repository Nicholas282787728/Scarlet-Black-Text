To the Editor:

Since it is very diiiicult for
me to visit all the mens halls
on a given housemeeting
night, i am taking this means
to suggest to you certain con.
siderations which l feel are
important in view oi the com-
ing elections on north campus.

Contrary to what some
seem to believe. Griruiell men
do possess considerable ireer
door and autonomy in their
residence hall liie, ilousemo.
thers, resident advisers, filer
ulty members are common.
place in men’ residence halls
today (the majority oi excepr
tions are iound in eastern
schools).

The residents of a men's
hall on our campus, in large
part through their hall offir
cers, really determine how ei—
iectiveiy the hall is operated.
This demands that an ex-
tremely high percentage of
the men are willing and able
to accept and carry out not
only a PERSONAL RESPON-
SlBlLlTY to contribute to-
werd an effective, resident
unit, BUT ALSO A RESPONe
SIBILITY TO HELP OTHERS
FULFILL THEIR OBLIGAr
TIONS TOWARD THIS GOAL
T00. On the whole, 1 think
we iunction quite well in this
respect; however, certain
shortcomings are obvious. We
know improvements can he
made toward the achievement
at more pleasant and cilicicnt
living.

With perhaps very minor
exceptions, i think this gen-
eralization is a valid one: As
HALL LEADERSHIP GOES,
so cons Tm: HALL. And
by hall leadership I don’t
mean just the hall president;
I mean every member oi the
ball council and every man
who is given or accepts some
degree oi leadership. There
tore it seems to me that the
election oi the C oi HP presi.
dang/the hall presidents and
the hall councils is an ex-
tremely important event; per-
haps much more signiﬁcant
than it we had housemothers
or resident advisers in the
halls. '

i hope you will give care-
iul consideration to your vole
ing‘, from the c oi HP presls
dent right on through the hall
council. My observation Is
that our hall councils could
function much more eﬁectlver
ly than they have as HALL
GOVERNING UNITS. Think
oi candidates ior hall council
positions in this light as well
as in terms or their ability to
perionn certain special iunb
lions.

We hear and read a lot
these days about “mature, in.
telligent individuals," We have
them; elect them! If you want
a residence hall conducive to
the development oi socially.
emotionally and intellectually
mature individuals, tbcn elect
the kind oi men who believe
this is important, and who
have displayed the skills nec-
essary to help bring it about,

To the Editor:
For the ﬁrst time that I can

. recall in the last four years,

\
l

the ﬁnancial manipulations of
the c or HP have been made
public. These iunctions, cu»
phemistically classiﬁed as stu—
dent government, were tier
scribed by the president oi
thc group in last week’s Scar.
let and Black. it is evident
that in the past iew years
the c of HP has developed
enough characteristics to dis-
tinguish it from any type oi
democratic governmental body,

There are many iunctions
oi the' c oi HP which would
lead one to consider it a so-
cial iratcrnity rather than a
responsible government, For
example, the 10 members op-
erate a proﬁtable washing ma.
chine business. The procecds
oi this activity provide iunds
for their “social functions."
Also. they ﬁnance the social
iunctions oi the Aws Board
whose own iunds seem to be
inextricably involved in the
Wmnen’s Social Budget.

The C of HP attempts to
establish an atmosphere of
group identity similar to that
of a social fraternity. This is
accomplished by using the sac
per capita from the social ice
of the Grinnell men to pro-
vide $150 to purchase CofHP
pins. Another eﬁ'ort to estab-
lish this identity has resulted
in the expenditure of $115.38
for letterhead stationery. This
fraternity has also indicated
that it is charitably inclined.
From their accumulation of
wealth, the C of HP members
have been generous enough to
give away $525 "because We
felt the cause important."

We men oi Grinncll seem to
have inherited :1 “representa-
tive group," the C of HP. to
carry out the funct‘mns of a
government. To say that this
group is representative (be-
cause it has a member irorn
each men‘s hall) does not
mean that it provides the men
of Grinnell with representa-
tive government based on the
will of the maiority. The C
of HP by its very slructurq
has no way to communicate

To the Editor:
It is stated in Article IV, Sec-
tion I of the Associated Women

Student’s Constitution that “the
executive power of this organi-
zation shall be vested in an
AWS Board consisting oi the
Fresldent oi the AWS and the
House President of each hall."
There is in practice no election
or a house president ior each
hall. Rather there is an elec—
tion oi seven girls to the Aws
Board. Following this election
each hall is assigned an AWS
Board member to be its presi—
dent. Contrary to the constitu—
tion the hall presidents are see
lected from AWS Board, rather
than Aws Board being com-
posed of ball presidents.

At iirst glance this error in
our present system may ap—
pear on the mere interpreta
tion or the constitution. But,
it goes iar deeper than this
and seriously aiiects the rep-
resentative nature oi our sys-
tem oi electing oiiicials.

Revisions have been made
within the present structure:
yet discontent and dissatisiac-
tion are still prevalent, If south
campus is ever to have a true
government, by and for the wa—
men studcnts, each girl must
have a say in who shall govern
her She must elect her own
house president, not the presi
dent for a group oi girls living
in the dorm next door,

The following is a proposed
plan tor a system of elections
which would result in a more
representative government.

Beiore spring vacation the
entire women student body

with its "subjects or to ascer—
tain student opinion. And
merely publishing a report oi
the way in which 10 men,
meeting in secret session,
have decided how they will
dispose oi money belonging to
more than 500 Ginnnellians
serves only to establish that
the C of HP is not a repre-
sentative government.
Because the c oi HP has
periormed administrative and
judicial iunctions which have
yielded revenue, it has ap
parently usurped the author»
ity to dispose at this moncv
also. in practice it not by i
ten Yet, as a judicial or
disciplinary authority,‘ the c
oi HP members have no right
to spend money belonging to
the men oi Grinncll for their
own purposes. in a similar
manner, a traiiic oﬁlcial has
no authority to spend the
money he receives as tranic
ﬁnes for a steak, a badge oi
office. or his iavorite charity.
The money which the c oi
HP members receive in the
periormance oi their elected
duties is not the property oi
this group or its individual
members. This money belongs
to the men of Grinneil, who
can no longer aﬁord to sup
port a governmental body in
the style to which the c at
HP has become accustomed.

Acid and Base

When Tom Skomia (a fabulous scholar of the class of
'53 who was probably the bat qualified man in Old G. his»

tory to run for s. c. Pres.)
and athletic Mchmsey, there
pouting faces in the ranks of
the vanquished. Skomia’s iace
was not among them. At the
tirst s. c. meeting under Mc-
Jimsey, Skornia took his seat
ior Cowles hall (it was and
continued to be a seat six
ieet irom the president's ta-
ble), watched without appar-
ent envy the not particularly
moving ceremony of gavel
presentation. and shook hands
with Mchmsey while smiling
the typical wry Skomla smile.
During the remainder of the
meetings Skornia fought a
large number at issues, and
backed a large number too,
with skilliul argument and
sincerity. His contributions
irom the iioor were at least
equal to the s. c President's
in importance, It is true that
he was not able to write “Slur

would elect the AWS Board
president and presidents ior
the ireshman balls. The pro-
cedure ior electing the‘Aws
Board president would remain
basically the same. The elec—
tion o_i ireshman hall prési»
dents would be from a list oi
juniors running speciiically
ior those oiiices.

Then. during the week iollow—
ing spring vacation, room draw—
ings would beheld iollowing
the same procedure as has been
ioliowed in the past. Aiter an
interval oi no longer than two
weeks and no shorter than one
week aiter room drawings have
been held, the rest oi the hall
presidents will be chosen. Those
students who will be in each
hall the torthcoming year will
elect a hall president from the
eligible juniors in their halls.

it is realized that any sug-
gested change will undergo
some revisions and modiﬁed-
tions. However, we icel that
the installation oi such a new
system, subject to some
changes, would oiier to the
Grinch woman a tar more
representative voice in her
government. She would be us.
in; her vote to elect a girl to
govern her and to represent
her views. rather than casting
random votes.

Furthermore, we are oi the
opinion that those elected to
AWS Board are not able to fu1~
fill adequately the dual func-
tions, oi the executive and judi-
cial bodies. We ieel that in
order to have a more eiiective
and representative Aws Board,
a separation oi these powers
should be considered.

grad school record, but he
had no need to. Law schools

ment Willie Fleming got from
Iowa football recruiters.

Those oi you who witness-
ed the ﬁrst Mchmsey meet-
ing and were also in Youn—
ker lounge last Wednesday
night were undoubtedly led
by memory to make the same
comparison at past and pres<
ent which I am tempted to
make here. But that business
is obvious and beside the
point as well. The point is
this: in a year oi change. dur-
ing which it will be possible
to bring about a great many
improvements ior our own
convenience, we do not have
time to piddle with disgusting
clique antagonism:

Clique: are useiul in their
places. They iuruish the powe
erful with a tool ior keeping
the almost-poweriul out of
power. It seems they have
certain social uses, too. But
when they dull the iorce oi
the general purposes, espec-
ially in an institution design-
ed to express the general pur-
pose, it is a matter oi bad
taste, Now is the time to
organize into a solid student
block, Good work has been
done concerning women’s
hours, A iew devoted individ-
uals have led an admirable
campaign ior open halls. But
ior the most potent eiiect,
needed to get what we want,
the unsatisfied voices oi the
many must join the unsatiSr
iied voices of the iew. If the
move for open balls is defeat
ed temporarily, you must be
openly and energetically and
unitediy unsatisﬁed.

Remember, the faculty is a
highly organized inﬂuence.
The inculty thought prepping
was bad for Ills and used its
iniluence accordingly. in ALL
matters the faculty knows
what is bad and good for us
and will use its power accord-
ingly. The administration
knows what is good ior us.
The trustees know what is
good ior us. The alumni know
what is good for us. The pub
cuts know what is good ior
us. Buildings and grounds
knows what is good for us
(cold alt). The foods depart»
men: know what was good fur

Ils (potassium min”). but
has fallen inﬁll new hands.
We must be as organized as
they are. And organization is
not a matter of individual
submission. but of individual
expression for a general
cause. This year is the year
tor a change. i ieel sure that
MOST of us will be able to
iorget clique obligations long
enough to accomplish it
