A clean sweep of the Iowa
College 880 and mile relays
marked the Pioneer track effort
at the Drake relays last Satur-
day, as Grinnell took first in
both events. Coach Burl Berry
gives part of the credit for the
victories to trainer Bob Slaugh—
ter who worked with lnjured
squad members John Bonyata,
and Don Young, getting both
men back to top form.

Although Young, Hugh Ac-
ton, Steve Hitchcock. and Bone
yata ran the finals in both
events, Tom Cage and Vince
Yager also had a share in the
triumphs. Under a new Drake
ruling this year, the team that
qualities does not have to be
composed of the same men whol
run in the finals. Therefore,‘
Coach Berry used Tom Cage
and Vince Yager in the prelimr
inary races and substituted Ac-
ton and Young in the ﬁnals.

, Win Going Away

In the ego relay the Pioneers
won in the time of 1:291 going,
away from Iowa Teachers,
Loras, Coe, and Cornell, who
finished in that order,

Hugh Acton grabbed a lead
at the start of the nule relay,
and the margin he gained was
increased by Hitchcock, The
race then settled down to a
dual between Grinnell and
Iowa Teachers. Don‘ Young,
third runner for the Pioneers,
lost a few yards, but still led
the field when he passed off to
anchor man Bonyata. Bonyata
dropped behind on the last
curve, but his final kick let
him break the tape five yards
in front of Iowa Teachers.
