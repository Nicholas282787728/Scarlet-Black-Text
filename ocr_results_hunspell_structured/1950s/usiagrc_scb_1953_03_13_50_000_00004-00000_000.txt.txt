The wrestlers are mad. All season long they have read big
Writeups about the Grinnell swimming and basketball squads, who
were having their best seasons in several years. But there were nol
banner headlines concerning the mat team. which was losing inore‘
matches than it was winning.

After they smashed Knox. 29-3, in their last dual meet, the
story mentioned “Grinnell’s oft-beaten wrestlers.” That word “oft.
beaten" sounded bad to Coach Bob Peterson’s charges—very bad:
So they did something about it At Ripon last weekend they urged
each other on, wrestled superbly, and returned home with second
place in the Midwest meet, the first Pioneer team to pull that trick
since 1949.

A Closer look ‘at the record shows that of the five Grinnell dual
losses, two were to huge Big Seven schools, one to unbeatable Cor.
nell, and the other two were slim one and two ,point defeats to
Carleton and Warthurg. I checked the record book for the past SJX‘
years, and none of those Grinnell squads managed to win four;
meets as this year's crew did.

Yes, the wrestlers are mad. In the end they finished higher in‘
conference standings than either the cagers or_the tankers, The,
grapplers can have the last laugh. They deserve it.

Simone is of the opinion that
Grinnell had a well balanced
team, which will always show
up well in the dual meets, but
in a meet like the conference,

individual strength.

Basketball Summary
by Fritz Goreham

Grinncll college’s 1952.53 cagcrs didn‘t win the Midwest
conference basketball crown, and they had one glaring weak—
ness, but yet they scored more points than any previous Pioneer
squad and didn’t lose a single game at home. Heading this drive
were Dove Stumbaugh and Bob Dibble, seniors; Bob Winter,
Junior; and Bud Crowl and Dick von Maur, sophomores.

These five with the assistance
of Tom Railsback, Harvey
Golden, Gardiner Button and
many others rolled to a total
season record of ten wins and
eight losses. This was virtually
the same team that last year
counted a 5.13 record and fin»
ishcd last in the conference.
During the current campaign,
the Ploneers remained in the
thick of the battle for the cone
ference title until the final week
of play. They finally ended in
third place.
