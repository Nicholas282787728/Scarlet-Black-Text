nmples on the other side of
the fence cannot be construed
in this manner either.

And the ubiquilous science
contradiction, what about this?
I have been informed that the
scientists are almost ready to
show the world how an organic
substance can be derived from
dead matter. “Well,” says the
adamant agnostic, ”there goes
Adam and Evc and the rest of
the scriptures."

Adam and Eve are gone,
but they were gone before,
that is, literauy; but meta—
phorically they can still be
here. Adam and Eve (Adam
means man in Hebrew) sym-
bolize the creation of human
life and the subsequent “Fall,"

Perhaps it seems that 1 am
walking on thin ice here;
through the nationalists perspec-
tive it might very well seem
that way, but as far as I’m
concerned rationale is not the
zenith of epistemology. Even if

all the devout Christians in thevleam by correspondence.

or with the Communist way of
life.

Many students maintain very
loose connections with the
Komsomol organization, and
articles have been published in
the Soviet newspaper recently
admitting inadequaCies of the
program, and trying to find
means of improvement,

Beginning this fall in the
USSR. a new educational
program is being initiated. We
tried to learn as much as pos-
sible about this new school
reform in our discussions with
educators and students. Gian-
erally speaking, the stress is
toward higher education com—
bined with socially useful
work.

This means that following
graduation from the secondary
schools, students will work full—
.time in factories, on state farms
and collective farms, in schools,
hospitals, etc., supposedly in
connection with their education
al interests. These students
would then have the opportue
nity to attend classes at night or

world were to read Hume’s ref-{two years in this program, they

utaticns of Aquinas' syllogistic
attempts at proving the exist-
ence of God, their faith would
remain intact; because it is a
faith and not a rational, objec-
tive, scientiﬁc evaluation.

“It you are convinced that the‘
only kind of reality is the sort
you can bang your fist against,
then God does not, cannot existl
But to settle the argument in
such summary fashion is to beg
the question; it is shoddy sci~
ence and infantile philosophy."
Albert Einstein was only one of
many who found “their sense
of mystery and of the ultimate
reality of God growing stronger
as the exploration of the tangi-
ble universe was pushed farther
and farther."

If you feel the need oi
something that will transcend
your anxieties, and it this de~
sire is a very strong one, Gnti
may very wcu be a legitimate
antidnte. when thinking in
terms of God, however, it is
faith that precedes reason and
not the other way around.

Indeed this does seem pare
verse to many people; in some
cases it may seem so gross a.
perversion that the person in
question might very well de-‘
cide to stay in his predictably
unhappy world instead of taking‘
a chance. For that is what it‘
is, a chance.

Saint Augustine maintained
that if you feel a need for God
and if you become humble and
venture out in search of Him,
you will ﬁnd Him. And when
you embody Him, so to speak,
you will henceforth reason with
Him inside of you. You will bel
illumined, things will make
sense.

This obviously is not an intelr
lectual belief, and I do not think
that one has the right to preach

the rejection of God on intellec-‘

tual grounds.

one reason. Also mentioned was

A second trend in Soviet
education is the increase of
boarding schools for primary
and secondary students. Board—
ing schools “create the most
favorable conditions for the

there were only 180,000 stu-

North Younker gained solc
possession of first place in the
m football league and became
the only undefeated and untied
team by virtue of a 7rG victory
over South in their annual
Homecoming game and a 6-2
triumph over Smith in what
may have been thc key game of
the title race.

North’s oncepcinl margin in
the South game was the result
of an extra-point pass by Joel
Prescott following a fake. kick
attempt. in the allrimportant
North—Smith game, the winning
points were scored aftcr an
alert North cnd recovered a
fumblcd punt on the Smith 20.
yard line. Smith’s ﬁrst loss drop.

Cowles bounced back with
victories over Gates (26-0)
and Clark (13-0), Dibble slow-
ed down a surprisingly strong
Rawson team in their clash,
and the game resulted in a
scoreless tie. During the week,
Rawson also picked up its first
loss of the season at the hands
. of a Ramsdell-less South team,
12-0.
