CofHP Seis
Rule System

Last Tuesday night the C
of HP set up a governing
system for the two men’s
off-campus living quarters,
Blum house and the Bar-
racks. These residences Wlll
have a system of student
self-government som e w h a t
similar to the present north
campus program.

A president and a vicepresi.
dent have been elected by each
of the housing units. In Blum
house, John Peterson is presi-
dent and Tom Knott, vice»presl-
dent; in the Barracks, Guy
Scandlen is president and Mike
Gough, vice—president.

The new presidents will
have authority to enforce all
regulations in the men’s hand-
book. However, unlike the
C of HP, they will have this
jurisdiction and ﬁning power
only within their own hous-
ing units

Peterson and Scandlen will
not have n vote in c of HP
meetings, although they will be
consulted on all C of HP mat-
ters concerning the off-campus
men students. The duty of the
vice-president will be to assume
the duties of the president in
the latter’s absence.

Parsons Sees Soviet Education Views:
“Important Tool For Commuﬁm”

by Bill Parsons
(third in a series)

Education is an important
tool to every society. In
America it is generally
agreed tllat education is
necessary for self-govern-
ment, that it Should act as
a liberating force which
frees the individual from ig-
norance and prejudice by
teaching him to think. It is
all important factor in shap-
ing our modern society.

Lenin emphasized education
as being of utmost importance
in the building of Communism
and Socialism. This emphasis
has been continued to the pres—
ent time. Education is not only
free. but most students in high.
er insitutions are provided with
stipends for living expenses;
three per cent of the gross na<
tionai product is spent for edu—
cation (usﬁone per cent);
professors earn five times the
average worker’s salary (us.—
twice the worker‘s salary).
These facts show the present
emphasis on education.

in nddition to being of im»
portance to the society in gen<

eral, education is of prime im-
portance to the individual. The

Soviet intelligentsia is a priv—
ileged group, with better jobs,
higher incomes and better liv—
ing standards. students enjoy
a position oi prestige and are

gloriﬁed in propaganm along

with the young workers as the
builders of Communism. Ac—
ceptance by an institution of

higher education is indeed a
big occasion, for it means the
difference between being a

oommon worker and a moon-
bcr ol this privileged group.

What are the activities of the
students in the higher schools?
Naturally, study is the main ob-
jective. Here many pressures

enter the picture which attempt
to keep the student industrious.
stipends vary to a certain de-

gree with performance. After
graduation only the top stu-
dents are allowed to choose
where they will work. The rest
are assigned jobs.

Also, the Komsomol (Commu—
rlist Youth Organization) exerts
a group pressure which helps
to keep students in line. Those
doing unsatisfactory work are
privately encouraged to work
harder and are publicly cma
barrassed. This constant pres.
sure to “shape up, shape up,
shape up,” is, of course, accon—r
panied by the threat to ”ship
out,” but we are told that less
than 12% did drop out after
being accepted by higher insti-
tutions.

Extra—curricular activities for
the students are organized
chiefly by Komsornol, which
includes so to 95 per cent of
all students. In addition to

this function in promoting“

scholarship, the Kornsomol
organizes many special in—
terest organizations. lt spon-
sore dances and other social
activities, stresses the import-
ance of participation in physi—
cal exercise, and presents
scries oi lectures and discus.
Sions of political theory. In
short, it attempts to meet all
the needs of the students.
Because almost all activities
are organized by Komsomol, it
is advantageous, and almost
necessary to be a member. But
this does not mean that all
Komsomol members are activ~
ists or even Communists. One

student, himself a nominal
Komsomol member, told me

SC Discusses
Music Series

No deﬁnite arrangement will
be made between the Student
Council and the Grinncll Com-
munity Concert Series until
further information is availablc,
it was determined at the council

. meeting last Wednesday.

The Concert Series has pro-
nosed that the council book
one at its concerts under the
Community Series in return
tor the right of all students
to be admitted on their ac-
tivity tickets to the other tour
concerts in the local series go
well as those in the Marshallr
town and Oskaloosn series.

The council decided not to
act on the odor until its own
ﬁnancial position was clearer,
student opinion was better de-
termined, and more information
was available on the series it-
self, sincc the group’s represent-
ativcs scheduled to appear bee
fore the council did not arrive
until after adiournment. By
then only president Steve
Faunce and six or eight council
members remained, but they
spent an hour and a half talking

 

with the president of the local’

group and a representative of
agency through
the Community Series
gets its performers.

The students’ primary con.
cern in this informal discus-
sion was that the Concert Se-
ries’ presentations would be
too classical to replace the
popular—type concerts the so
normally provides. This led
the Community Series’ presi-
de'llt to relax his group‘s ear-
lier restriction and give the
college complete freedom to
select the one concert for
which it would pay.

The Series’ president also said
that the location of this par-
ticular concert could be agreed
upon later, which was a modis
ﬁcation of the series’ earlier re-
quirement that it be in the
‘Community auditorium.

Technicalitles would make it
;necessary for the college-ﬁnanc.
ed concert to be hooked through
the community group, The stu.
dents then seemed to agree that
the one possible loss to the col-

Monday, Oct, 12, to Wed~

Letters should be put in
the mailbox of Richard S.
Westrall, chairman of the
committee on student puh-
lications,

lcge would he that when acts
ing independently it often hooks
performers “en route" at a re-
duced rate, which could not
necessarily be done for the one
concert the college hooked thru
the Community Series.

The series president pointed
out that under his revised pro-
posal, the college would be
gaining admittance to concerts
in the thrcc towns, presentations
lwhich hc labeled as the ”mid
dlc range” between the. college’s
