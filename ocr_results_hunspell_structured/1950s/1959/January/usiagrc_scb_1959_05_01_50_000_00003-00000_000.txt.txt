There was less lip—biting this_
year, less waving at roommates

once, 1e s s sclt » consciousness 3
about dabbling in a performance
on the Grinnell boards by ,
dance group. Lastﬁnight’s concci
was a serious attempt to create
a periormance that approached,
the artiul. It was not a pep-‘
rally. .

The moods expressed were
not expansive. and oitentiincs ,
gave a helping hand to (her
limitations or the dancers’
bodies, but ’the movements l
we're executed neatly and
completely. At times i felt
that the dancers did not enjoy
the large area or space they l
had to move in fully enough. l

Movement was somewhat sc-
datc at times, but this minor
shortcoming was refreshing afterl
the uncontrolled attempts at
exuberance in previous concerts.

For. once Orchesis did not inn
dulgc itself in cuteness . i . the
cuteness which thcy previously
employed to apologize for lime
itcd technique.

The few lighter numbers;
“Duct Primitif," "Capriolc" l
(the minor coniliet oi two bar-
lequins), “Jabberwock” (a
zany interpretation of Lewis

'Carrollls nonsense <7) limer-
ick) were done with charm.

The fourth “Beatnik On A
Victorian Chai , was a hangnaill
irom the “old days” , . , a self.
conscious attempt to make a
tunny which was not quite as
funny as tbc choreographer ondl
dancers planned.

tions of color and drape, werc
