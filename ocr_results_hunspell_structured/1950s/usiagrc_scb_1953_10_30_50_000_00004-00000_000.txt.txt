Grimell’s Pioneers finally
came to life last Saturday and
in dblng so handily walked over
Cornell by a score of 2776. In
playing their best game of the
current season the Pioneers
chalked up seven touchdowns
only to have three called‘ back
by penalties.

Grinnell’s first score came
with only four minutes gone as
Nick Ryan scored from the two‘
after Vic Eampeloerg had in-
tercepted 3 Ram aerial on the
Camel! 27- Dick v-on Malnr boot-
ed his first of three wnverslcns.
Grimell scored twice more in
the same period but lboth wre
nullified by penalies,

After a deadlocked second
period the Pioneers iced the
game by hitting pa‘ydirt twice
in the third quarter Tim
Walker intercepted on the
Cornell 30 and two plays later
Don Hager tallied on a 25
yard jaunt.

Hagar went over from the
three a-ftei' Chuck McKay bldck-
ed a punt that Wally Stevens

Cornellians 21- 6

recovered_ on the Rams nine.

Don Rohvit scored Cornell's
lone marker on a 1‘5 yard dash
over right guard after the Pie-
neers had cdme out second best
on a punt exchange. Grinnell
returned hhe kickoff to its own
43 and six plays later were on
the Cornell one.

Evidently the officials didn’t
credit Grinnell with an extra
down after Cornell liatl ao-
ceptc-d an offsides penalty on
the play which Rampelherg
scored irom the one. Two plays
later Grinnell recovered a
tumble on the Rams seven
and Ryan scored after linger
moved the ball to the one.

Last week's individual duel between Grinnell’s Don Hagar
and Cornells Jim Galloway ended in a virtual draw The two
crashing fullbacks, being boosted ior all—conference and even Little

proved to be the offensive dynamite of their teams

in 24 rushing plays Galloway galloped 146 yards for an aver-

Freshman Harriers
Ouidisiance Ramst
Face Coe Salurday

In its first taste of competi-(‘
tion, the 'prdmising freshman
harrier squad came through with
flying colors by tripping Cor-
nell’s frosh 22735 last Saturday.
Pioneer Dave Clarke led the
teams over the two mile course,
finishing in 10:42.8.

Also gaining points were Lar-
ry Schaleger. seoond; Dan Ver
Ploeg, fifth; Bob Downs, sixth;
and Bill Davidson, eighth. Ninth
spot went to Marv Olsen, fol-
lowed by Bob Smith, twelfth.

In a postal meet with Iowa
State, the frosh were swamped
15-45, as I. s. C. runners took
the first five places.

Tomorrow the squad journeys
to Cedar Rapids, where it will
run against Coe between halves
of the Coe-Grinnell freshman
football game. Coe should fume
isl-l stiffer competition than

' Cornell.

Also scheduled is a freshman
conference telegraphic meet idl-
next Wednesday. Each team will
run on its own track and then
wire the results to the Midwest
conference headquarters, Ripon,
Wisconsin.
