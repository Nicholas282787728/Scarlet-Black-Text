By John Smith

Grinnell’s baseball team
established two modern rec-
ords in beating Cornell 84
Wednesday onthe home diae
mondt The Pioneers’ Dick
Crawl struck out 15 men and
Grinnell swiped 13 bases to
set records in these depart-
ments. Grinneli owns two base-
ball Victories over the Rams,
having earlier defeated them at
Mount Vernon, Ia.

John Bohnnnon and John
Copeland paced the team of-
fensively. Copeland led oi:
the fifth inning with a home
run, while Bohannon collected
two singles and a triple in
three oliieial trips to the plate
tor a perfect day, Grinnell
picked up theirs runs on 9
hits and tour errors The Pio-
neers’ big inning was the 23th
when they scored three nnr
earned runs on tivo errors,
two passed balls. and a singlet

Crowl gave up five,hits and
five bases on balls. He put the
Rams down in order in the 2nd
and Ath frames.

Last weekend Grinnell plays
ed a douhleheader in Northtield,
Minn. against Carleton. The Pie.
neers split in two onerun af—
fairs, losing the first game 5-4
and grabbing the seven inning

Roegge turned in a good’per.
furmance in the first game and
Dwight Nissen looked good in
the second game, although he
needed help late in the affair
from Crowl. Three doubles by
catcher Jim Pfannenstiel high-
lighted the second game.

Yesterday afternoon at 3
the, varsity baseball squad
tangled with Iowa Conference
team, Central College of
Pella, on the Pioneers’ home
diamond. Although this was a
non-conference game, the Grin-
nell nine was out to even the
score with the Iowa conference,
having previously dropped a
game to Wartburg.
