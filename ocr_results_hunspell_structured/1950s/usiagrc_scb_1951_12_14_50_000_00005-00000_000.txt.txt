will be spending their days in
preparation for two conference

The contests will be Dec. 28

These games will replace the
North Central conference tours

That conference voted to abolish
the tourney this year, leaving
Grinnell and the other two
schools, who are members of the
conierence, without any holiday
contests. Last year South De-
kota State won the meet with
Grinnell finishing third.

however, the Air Force may

Coach John Pfilsch comment-

The Grinnell Pioneers last
night ran into conference trouble
as they were defeated by the
Monmouth Scots 71.57. The
‘Grinn-ellians gave every indicar
tion of pulling through in the
last quarter, as they did at Coe,
when they broke down their
trailing margin to two points
with three minutes remaining.
But the hard righting Scots
put the skids to the Pioneers for
.the last minutes and coasted to
the 14 point victory margin.
High point man for the game
was Monmouth’s freshman slat,
Pete Kovaes, with 22 points.
The remainder of the scoring
for the Monmouth men was

lCoaeh Pfitsch compares Dunlop
with the three All-Americans he
coached at the University of
Kansas. What more could be
said?

Dave who hails

ing in the finance department
of the Air Force and hopes to
play pro basketball after he is
through serving his country.
