, ‘ For Your Consideration

Campaigning has been short this
speeches few. Some of us have been

year, and campaigm
unable to attend the

planned events due to lack of time, some to lack of incli-
nation. For these reasons the next two pages are devoted

to statements of policy by the two candidates and their
backers, biographies of the candidates, and comments upon
the status of Student Council and Student Government by
SC president Kitten Arveson, and SC representative Ed
Laing, and information regarding voting. Reprinted below
is the ballot which will determine the fate of the new aspir-
ants and an old project, Thanksg‘ving vacation.

Here, literally at your fingertips, is all the informa-
tion needed to make a wise and rational choice. Take ad-
vantage of it, Read it new; study, think about, and discuss
it over the weekend. Read it again Sunday night and cast
a considered vote Monday. In this way your vote will count
not only toward a total, but to you.

SCARLET AND BLACK

The Sound
and
The

Fu ry
by Art Trnvers

Last week the underlying
apathy of the Grinnell student
body was flushed to the sur
face. It was commented on in
an editorial, and ll: has been
the subject of countless bull~
sessions about the dormitories.
The question seems to be: Just
what is causing this apathy?
This brings us around to our
topic for this week.

Grinnell, like any other instir
tution of higher learning. is
graced with individuals whose
personality is so one-sided as
to virtually exclude interest in
anything not directly connected
with their realm. Accordingly,
we present: Campus Archetypes,
Vol. 1.

The campus Sophisticate: You
know the type, He (under-
stand that, in most cases, the
pronouns “he" and “she“ are
interchangeable.) comes 1:!) the
house meetings with “The
New Yorker” tucked under
his arm. He finds a fairly sc-
cluded section of the lounge
where he proceeds to remove
an English Oval from his cig:

' aret case, light it with his

monogramed Flaminair, and
engross himself in the latest
article by s. .r. Perelman. Any
mundane matters concerning
student government are be-
neath his dignity. when he

‘does deign in comment, his
remarks are tainted by the
cheap cynicism which is
characteristic of gods triﬂing
with human aifnirs,

The cnmpus artiste: Fine arts
are an integral part of a lib-
eral education. Some people
think that liberal education in
an interesting adjunct to artis—
tic training. We may see this
type padding about the hall
in dressing gown and slippers,
hail- disheveled, a copy of “Man
and Superman” in his hand. if
you have the inclination to
speak with him, you are liable
to receive a rather incoherent
answer. But it is your own fault.
Any idiot can see that he has
given himself completely to the
muses.

”Ah, Phillstlne," he declaims,
placing a tortured hand to his
brow, “can you not conceive?"

“Conceive what?" you ask.

“Oh God, the masses," he says
and pads off, reciting “King
Lear".

The artiste cannot be bother
ed with student government,
since it would conﬂict with his
noblcr self,

The campus anhusiasi: This
person is generally entitled
“Gung Ho." We see him at the
basketball game. He cannot be.
lleve that the opposing team is
capable of good basketball.
When he cheers, he works his
body and jaw into such posi—
tiuns that he perspires more
freely than the players. When
a {cums called on us, he howls
like a ruptured bull elephant
despite the fact that everyone
in the stands could see our man
knee their forward.

He feels that students don’t
have enough power, but he
doesn’t know anything about the

governing sci-up. He doesn't
know how to increase student
power, and thus he satifies him-
self with coming into your room
and making derogatory remarks
about the administration and
facility, but doesn’t offer any
ideas on how to alter the pres
ent system or create anything
new.

The campus sag: This man is
loaded with ideas. He dreams
up earthy messages with which
to adorn flags. He ﬂips fire
crackers into the loggia. He has
a long background at such en-
deavnr, beginning vn’th his pea-
shooter and water-pistol days.
He cannot be bothered with
things like student government,
since they’re ”no fun."

I realize that most of us have
these tendencies innate in us.

able to place a governor on
them so that no single thing
