Word comes to me of a new
organization called “The Scar-
let Squires.” It seems that the
only purpose of the organiza-
tion is promoting fellowship
among the members. By so do-

Social Experiences

Student regard for chapel‘ones has left some unfavor-
able impressions upon some faculty members. Hall open
houses and dinners have produced noticeable cases of soclal
discourtesy. Because of this, some faculty members are
now reluctant to accept invitations to hall affairs,

Group reaction is probably one of the more petty rea-

sons for this situation,

for if the chaperon is also a stu-

dent‘s professor, immature remarks are often made con-
cerning the student‘s intentions. But perhaps the greatest
reason concerns reaction toward the entire chaperon sys-

tem. Because a chaperon is necessary,

he is purposely ig-

nored or considered as big brother with watchful eye.
Thus unpleasant attitudes make friendly conversation im-
possible. This social immaturity will probably do the most
to squelch a more mature system.

Whatever the reason, and there are undoubtedly more,
we feel chaperones should not be penalized. Their presence
shows an interest in campus social life, for theirservice is
not by demand, Often they are asked by halls, which in

turn ignore them. We don’t

feeling, but we find it embarrasing,

like to have that Wallﬂower
as chaperones probably

do, to enter a conversation in which we aren‘t Welcome, If

regarded as invited guests,

rather than begrudgingly as

necessities, their presence could be enjoyable and interest-

ing.

Chaperones are faculty members with interesting anec-
dotes and activities. As active members of the college, they
create it’s formal intellectual atmosphere, but We‘ve been
at informal, social discussions with faculty members that
we consider just as valuable. Proper courtesies to chaperones
may stimulate a great deal more of these gatherings.

Grinnell Conference Delegate
Notices "Complex Tempers"

by Key Wham Kim

“Revolution and Reconciliation" was the central theme
of the Ecumenical Student conference which I attended dur-
ing this Christmas vacation for nearly a week on the cam»
pus of Ohio university in Athens, Ohio. It was held under
the auspices of the Student Volunteer movement and the
sponsorship of the United Student Christian Council,

The main pait of the pro-
gram, consisting of two big
daily general sessions of
prayers and addresses, was
strong in stressing the neces-
sity of the ecumenical effort
among all churches. All of the
many Christian leaders who
spoke in these sessions seemed
to be unanimous in insisting
that all churches be united. Be
cause the churches of Christ are
“his body" which is one and no
many, a reconciliation is pos-
sible only through Him in this
age of threatening crisis

Frank Discussion

The importance of other
parts of the program, consistv
ing of such activities as small—
group Bible discussions and in-
ternational festivals and forums
on different parts of the world,
was equally as great. Frank and
free exchange of ideas and

opinions between American and
foreign students, who together
numbered approximately 3,400,
seemed to be very helpful for
understanding our problems, as
well as for formulating courses
of intelligent action that we
should take in thc near future.

Out of these discussions came
forth, for instance, the almost
unanimous opinion that future
missionary work should not fol-
low thc traditional policy that
disregarded the inherent native
cultural and social elements in
transplanhng Christianity. The
forums, such as the one .on Rude
51a that I attended, were also
very revealing. The speaker in
the Russia iorm, an American
who had been one of the farm
delegates to Russia last summer,
suggested that if any missionary
work is ever attempted in Rus-
sia, it should not try to convert

the Russian system outright.
Friendliness

The atmosphere of the con-
ference was generally filled with
very friendly feelings, which
led a friend of mine to make
the cheerful remark that “Every-
body here is friendl" Under-
neath the spirit of friendliness,
however, there existed, it seem-
ed to me, many complex tem-
pers in terms of national and
racial groups.

The Africans were the group
that struck me the most. They
seemed to be extremely militant
over their current racial and
political questions, and appeared
to act as if they were about to
”tear down" something with

their pent-up emotions. 0f the
great number of lndian repro—
sentatives, many were generally
quite Nehrushappy. The propor-
tionally highly represented Far
Easterners seemed to be quite
concerned about restoration of
international integrity. Tliel
American representatives there
gave me the feeling that they
were somewhat guilt-stricken,
though not too persistently, with
something for which they had
been innocent and yet responsi-
blc.

All Faiths
Ono wish that I had often
throughout the conference and
still havc now, )5 that this type
of ecumenical movement seek-
ing a possible common denome
inator among the people of
many diverse faiths should in
the near future extend beyond
the bounds of Christianity. 1 for
one think that if the revolution
that we confront at present is
global, as the conference tried
to present, then the ecumenical
effort should cover all faiths
throughout the world.

he of benefit to the college as
well as to the individuals, ii
the members keep the prop»
er perspective and attitude and
use the club to help promote
other things (such as study
sessions before finals, friendly
poker games, etc.) then the
club should prove to be worth
while. Good luck fellows.

Time now to pick your cours-
es for next semester (of course
by the time this comes out,
most of the upperclassmen will
have registered) and it behooves
us to be‘ most careful in our
choices.

1) Don’t Sign for any course
which causes you to walk up-
stairs.

2) Don‘t Sign up for eight
o‘clocks.

3) Don’t schedule eleven
o'cloeks. (They interfere with
lunch.) '

4) Don’t sign for any outside
ARK. (Too much Walking.)

5) Don't take any course that
requires a term paper.

6) Don‘t Schedule any after-
noon classes

7) Don’t take any professor
who has a reputation for being
hard.

8) Don't Sign up for courses
requiring expensive books.

This leaves you with nine
hours, but don't try to take
them. Everybody else has been
there first and these classes
are closed. Tough break, but

some day you may get them,
t . k

The one unfortunate thing
about vacation is daytime Tv
which i don’t watch here. Caught
one for kids starring a talking
light bulb and some simmering
halfwit. Does this appeal to
our American kids?

To the Edwin

The very interesting discus-
sion of “Honor System or not?”
that has entered almost every
issue of the 8&8 via editorial
comment 01‘ letters to the edi-
tor, seems to have omitted one
View.

As a temporarily disinterest»
ed third partyka Grinnell Stu-
dent attending class in Wash
ington for a semester—l have
nonetheless acquired an inter-
est in this discussion. ,

An honor system would re-
quire the student to take ac-
tion in cases of cheating by
rising above any personal
friendships Io report these
violations. This requires a
strong sense of honor and ma»

tnrity.

However, if this maturity is
present or could be achieved,
would an honor system the nec<
essary'!

It is certainly as easy to
comprehend this maturity to
prevent said cheating without
an honor system as easily as
with one. If a person‘is to ’be
considered mature and respon~
sible, why shackle him with a
system treating him as too im-
mature to refrain from cheat-
ing? And if he is too immature
the system will fail anyway.

This system of “individual”
maturity is also much easier on
friendshipsﬁll due respects to
Art Travers' comment on the
doubtful desirability of these
friendships.

sincerely,
Tony Dalsimer
