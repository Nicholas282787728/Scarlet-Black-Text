Experiment In Dining

Co-educational dining has become a reality during
lunches. After an unsuccessful experiment last year, we
were skeptical about the outcome of this year‘s trial. But
We now hope it will continue after spring vacation.

Major success in student participation lies in the in-
formality in which lunches are operated. Previously, there
were red and yellolv slips of paper which served as tickets
of admission to either dining hall. It was necessary to make
reservations, which gave a formal air to the meals. This
defeated an objective of allowing people to spontaneously
decide to eat at either dining room. The objective is now
achieved, for no tickets are required, and more are taking
advantage of the plan.

We’ve heard the remark that Cowles dining room has
become more quiet and mannerly as a result of the plan.
This is a welcome reality. The presence of women has de -
initely led to slower eating and better conversation in
softer tones. Unfortunately, the Quad dining room may
be suffering under the plan. Men are cutting lines, and
many take the attitude of “Lets eat at the Quad today,
big joke.” Rude practices have resulted from this joking
manner.

We’ve also seen entire tables of men at the Quad, and
women at Cowles. There is no point in eating in the oppo—
site dining room if men or women group themselves together
in the lunch line so that table companions are of the same
sex. Perhaps if men and women reailized they didn‘t need
moral support from their friends they would not go in
groups larger than three.

‘ _ Greater awareness of the coeducational purpose of
dining under the present experimental system- can make
the system a permanent one.
