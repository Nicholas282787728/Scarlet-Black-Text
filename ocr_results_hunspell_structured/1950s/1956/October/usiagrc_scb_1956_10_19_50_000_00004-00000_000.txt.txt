As the Pioneer Gridders ap-
proached last week’s Ripon
game it appeared that, outside
of themselves, the footballers
had the backing of only a few
groups or individuals. The
sports staff of the soda was
one of these groups and the
thanks we got was a criticism
of one of the stories in which
the Grinnell varsity was refer-
red to as being the underdog,
which they were according to
conference and press releases,
and as having everything to
gain and nothing to lose, which
appeared all too obvious since
they were two down in the
loss column and blanked on the
win side.

As sports editor I will never
apologize for anything appear—
ing on the sports pages unless
it is an obvious mistake which
I don't think this was, We will
print only the unvarnished truth
as it appears to us and to ex-

pert observers. -

Being on the low end of a
21—14 football score is sad
enough for a team but it is
made even sadder when they
brilliantly toutplayed the vic~
tors. Elsewhere in the paper
you can find a story giving the
full dope on the game but as
far as this column iS'concerned
I want to be sure that mention
is made of outstanding perform~
ances in the line by Jerry
Kurth, John Larew and Dick
Thomas. in the backfield the
hard running of Jack Shaffer
and passing of Steve Bauser-
man brought gasps from more
than one spectator at Ripon.

Sportsmanship is a big thing
in intramural sports; so im-
portant in fact: that a trophy
is given to the hall exhibiting
the best spirit of sportsman-
ship throughout the year.

In my opinion 1 think that
the Smith intramural chairman
was guilty, this week, of most
flagrant stroke of poor sports<
manship seen thus far this year.
The situation involved was his
failure to honor the request of
North Younker's I.M. chairman
that their game. played last
Monday, he called off.

The North-Smith game was
looked upon by 1M enthuse
iasts as the game of the year
since both teams were strong
this year and were tied for the
loop lead when they met. North
approached game time with sev-
eral of their key players down
with injuries or sickness, thence
the request for postponement.

Smith’s failure to honor the
request indicates to me that
their 1M. chairman did not
have any sportsman-like wishes
to make the North game the
“game of the year," which it
could have been, but cared
only for the opportunity to take
on a team obviously interior
due to illness and injury.

Smith played North on Mon
day and Smith's LM. chairman
got what he wanted; a victory.
i wonder, though. just how
satisfied the members of his
I.M. team were with their vic-
tory. They are on top of the
heap and will probably stay
there but it might have been
different. We’ll never know.

Pioneer Eleven
Lose To Ripon
In Tough Game

By Arnie Alpert:

A grim and determined Grin-
nell college football team, seek-
ing its first Win of the cam-
paign after two unsuccessful ef—
forts, jogged out underneath the
Ingalls field lights in Ripon,
Wis.. last Saturday to do battle
with Ripon college. The inspir~
ed Redmen, with a 2042 upset
of Coe to their credit, had as-
pirations for the loop lead.
Grinnell, undeniably outclassed
against (Joe and Lawrence, was
superintendent of the Midwest
conference cellar. t

It was no case of Frank Mel'-
riwell heroics. Two and one-
half hours later Grinnell trot-
ted off into the dressing room
with its Win column unblem-
ished. Ripon, if nothing else, at
least had a 21-14 victory to
show for the night’s work.

‘ Team Play

There are instances, however.
when other things mean more
to a determined football team
than the score of a game. Last
weekend was one of these
times. AS coach Bob Peterson
stated in the dressing room,
“Our season, boys. just began
Tonight, for the first time this
year, we played like ,a team.”

According to the statistics, it
was one of the best: games that
Grinnell has played for several
years. Viewing it critically, it
was the finest game I’ve seen
the Pioneers play, and this
game was number 15. Employ—
ing only half of its (“J-man
squad, Grinnell played a spirit-
ed, well-organized and intelli-
gent game from the opening
kickoff until Jack Schaffer
moved the ball within striking
distance of the Ripon Crossbars
on the last play of the contest

The Pioneers gained eight
more first downs than their op-
ponents; they ranifor 88 more
yards on the ground, and gains
ed 64 more yards by passing
Fumbles cost Grinnell the game
as Ripon turned three of these
five miscues into touchdowns.

Bausermnn Sparks Drive

The crowd of 700 was on its
feet for most of the night after
Ripon took a quick lead when
fullback Dave Smith plunged
three yards through center for
a 21-yard touchdown drive.
Shaffer went five yards to high-
light an 81—yard advance. Soph-

the team itself feel that the pioa ,
neers have a chance. Whetherl
they do or not you can bet that l
they'll be fighting their hearts
out and the least the Grinnell
fan can do is get out there and
give vent to something more
than a few half-hearted yells.
Go to the game and let them
know you’re there.

In Struggle For IM Football Crow

In 1M football this Week
Gates was defeated 18-0 by
Langan. Marty Hall was the
main reason the defeat was not
more lopsided. His play at de-
fensive guard was outstanding.

Cowles won a very tight 6-7
decision over Clark on Thurs
day. Bob Hurst gathered in a
pass from Jerry Gray in the
first quarter for the score. Ga-
brielson’s golden toe was re
sponsible for the winning point.
Wilson made the most dramatic
play of the game, intercepting
a pass and making a long run—
back. '

Earlier in the week North de-
feated Clark 13-0.
