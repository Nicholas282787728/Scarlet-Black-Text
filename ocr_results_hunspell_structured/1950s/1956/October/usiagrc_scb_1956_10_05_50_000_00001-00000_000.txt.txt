Bowen Discusses

College Expansion
A’r Bullet Supper

Pl' e s i d c n t Howard R.
Bouell talked with student
leaders last night about fu-
ture college development. He
and Mrs. Bowen were hosts
to heads of campus organizar
tions at a buffet slipper at
their home.

Ml'. Bowen outlined his
thoughts about college expan-
sion. He emphasized that the
plans were tentative, and cam-
pus opinion was welcome.

Citing an increase in students
of college age, he stated that
perhaps Grinnell had an obliga-
tion to take care of an added
number. However, he also point-
ed out that the college has an
obligation to fulfill its present
role as a small liberal arts col-
lege, and to maintain its pres—
ent standards.

The present ideas include
boosting enrollment to approxi-
mately 1100. Mr. Bowen asked
opinion concerning the type of
living accomodations for added
students. He also pointed out
that a new library and fine arts
building would be needed.

Coffee hours, the president’s
roundtable, and student council
meetings were suggested as pos-
sible channels for student dis
cussion. An architectural firm
will outline tentative physical
changes. Expansion ideas will
then be considered at the No-
vember meeting of the Board
of Trustees.
