‘All My Sons' Good Production;
Stewart, Osborne Excel In Roles

By Martha Kelly

Some very competent acting, good production and out-
standing performances by Jim Stewart and Sally Osborne
made last night’s play, “All My Sons” a most rewarding
evening. The play, by Arthur Miller (author of ”Death of
a Salesman”) is a naturalistic tragedy concerning man’s

responsibility to society, espec'
ially as it conflicts with his re-
sponsibility to the family. Miller
uses some pretty weary devices,
(the letter which reveals all,
and Visitors who must be told
the past action) but the play
Comes off quite successfully
anyhowt

Sally Osborne, as Kale Keller,

turned in an extremely fine
job; at times almost prufessional.
Her interpretation of the part
was intelligent and sympathetic,
without being maudiin. She
showed considerable control,
both technically and emotion-
ally, and produced a well round—
ed character.

Jim Stewart did a. less con-
sistent, but verp powerful job
as Joe Keller, the war profi-
teel'. Occasional technical dif-
iiclllties in gestures, movement
and voice control hampered
him, as well as 2. slight ten-
dency to “ham” but his inter-
pretation was fine and his
character was very strong,
Dennis Furbush and Judie

Reget did sympathetic and skill-
ful jobs as Chris and Anne.
Furhush's interpretation seemed

2| little immature at times and
as a result, his‘character did not
emerge with all the strength
that it should have, His charac-
ter was charming and believable,
Judie Regent’s portrayal of
Anne was Consistent and well-
thought out but sometimes
seemed a little too studied, Part
of’the difficulty seemed to be
that Chris and Anne are not as
clearrcut nor wcllrmotivated
characters as Joe and Kate.

The lninor characters all did
good jobs and seemed to have
consistent and full characteri-
zations, Caryl Wagner was
charming as Lydia and Alyce
Kengle, as Sue, was appropri-
ately shrewish, without being
villainous Steve Michaelmas,
Dick Armstrong and Tony
Dalsimer were properly emo-
tional, obnoxious, and philo-
sophicai.

Caryl was a trifle sacczrhlne
at times and Armstrong, a little
over-enthus i a s tlc. Dalsimer
tended to be rather stiff and
Michaelides occasionally spoke
