Spring Disturbances

“Your name has been placed in the records 01' the
Council of House President’s as a participant in the dis-
turbance at the Women‘s Quadrangle on tlle evening of
April 4."

Approximately :30 mell received tllcse greetings from
the Council of House Presidents tllis week, as a result of
fast week’s “disturbance." Nine men were filled. The let»
ters only mean what is stated. C of HP melnbers emphasize
the fact that nothing should be read into them.

This action by the C of HP prompted many enraged
accusations from llortll calnpus men. It seems to us tllat
the situation has not been carefully examined. We must
first remember that under the present system, the Couli-
cil of House Presidents lnust enforce all regulations. Under
their inherent powers, this would include the duty of main,
1‘ 'ning order at all campus outbreaks involving men.

The C of HP could have taken nlany alternate courses
of action:

1. They could have fined all participants in the out,
break. However, this could convey the impression
that it is possible to purchase a riot, botll an un-
fair and unwise circumstance.

. They could have levied suspended fines, which
would add on to future offenses. This, too, would
seem to be too harsh for the demonstration.

". They could have placed social restrictions upon the
demonstrators. We feel that this would be better
than fines, but ill this situation, the outbreak did
not merit such action.

4. They obviously could have ignored the incident.

These are the most evident; there are undoubtedly
more.

Any of the above penalties would have blown the
demonstration out of proportion. However, some action was
mandatory. for the C of HP must show that it is able to
handle its own problems free of administrative intervem
tion. This was especially trlle for this outbreak, for the
demonstration was an initiation for the new council, since
it had beell in office two days. We feel the members ade-
quately handled the disciplinary measures,

However, we do feel that they could have been more
effective the night of the disturbance. We got the impres-
sion that they were more interested in getting names ol'
the participants, than ill dispersing the mob. It is true that
the president set the railroad tracks as a bound; 'y alld

riled men not to cross them, but after this warning was
ignored, it seemed that the council'circulated to get names,
rather than to move the mob back on the legal side of the
tracks.

l In addition, they placed neither sign nor sentinel at
the tracks to warn latercolners not to cross them, thereby
getting unknowing men on their lists.

A more active council would have eliminated much of
the ensuing- disciplinaryVaction.

Tile demonstration was the initial boost for campus
enthusiasm. This enthusiasm continues with the publication
of two newsrsheets, The Spectator and The Speculator
seemingly dedicated to preserving and enlarging the splr
generated. This spirit has enlivened campus activity, and
promises to make this spring all exciting one. We might
add for the benefit of Spectator and Speculator readers
that the Scarlet and: Black continues to be unsurpassed ill
presenting Grinllell college news to the campus.

Conversation Pieces

Brave souls who' venture upstairs ill the Student Union
can see the long-talliedeabout “changes.” At last the llllioll
is 10054 devoted to students, as its name suggests.

Besides the TV room alld various student offices, the
second floor boasts several ”conversation rooms" alld “hi ['i
listening rooms." The hi fi isn’t installed yet, but neat
little signs promise that sets are being considered and
should be ready soon.

The “conversation rooms,” basically a good idea, are
really prett, funnv One reliable source told lls each of
the rooms l i'lllnished with a cllair and a couch# or
one day onlH Now the couches have been replaced with
desks, which scarcely seem more suitable for “conversation”
than the earlier furniture.

Seriously, we like these changes. Seriously, put the
touches back. ,

Far From

Customary
Skies

By G ene Thompson

(Editor’s Note: We welcome
Gene Thompson as our regular
columnist. Look for his col-
unm each week in this same
position.)

Lo and behold, The adminise
trutive staff at the Scarlet and
Black has again seen {it to all
this space with a student-\vrlt—
(en “column.”

“So this is what they're like.”
you are probably saying to your-
self, (ll you're not saying that
please say it so the rest of this
will make/sense.) 1! you'll just
lhinh a minute you’ll reallze
that it's easy to recognize a
“column," but rd better give
you a few pointers so you'll be
sure lo find this thing next
week.

The first clue, of course, is
the eye~urrcsting title at the
top. As you can scc, it means
nothing. printed up there all
by itself. and even ii it were
in a. sentence (or a paragraph
for um matter) it would slill
mean nothing. This, believe it
or not, is the very secret of
its success. The theory is that\
the casual reader shims
through a newspaper just
waiting to have his eye are
rested.

Another Clue lies in the very
shape of the column itself As
you see, this one is longer than
ii is, wide But before you get
all cocky and .think you really
have ii made, a word of warn»
ing someday i may not have
much to say in such an event,
the column would, oi course. be
wider than it is long. Watch out
for this.

If you still have trouble. go
over this lesson again. Or
mum: to me nnd I can find the
column for you. Or maybe
yuu can just forget about it.

But for the present, since
you have found the column and
have read this far, maybe l
should make iuicv comment on
our life here at the Park Street
School ror Kids.

n is quite evident that we arm
in general, much better off as!
students in the “Grinnell Coir
lege Community" than wc were
when 1 first road the Catalog
two years ago and sized up
Grinnell as a fine old school
founded by eleven fine old mine
Esters and dedicated to ﬂood libr‘
eral arts education, AFROTC,l
and social experience. Things‘
have changed a limb. i don’t
know exactly what we’re dedi-v
catcd to now, but at least ii
isn't ROTC, and things are look.
ing up.

Tlle new "liberalization pol-
icy“ on the purl of rnculty and
administration is really somcv
thing to behold. Just as they
are moving imm under tllcir
customary skies (pardon the .
poetry, but i hnvc in do some

thing with that title) I plan to
do something u little diiiereut
in the way or newspaper col-
umns.

i like to believe that a small
part of the changes that have
been made have come about
through the efforts of a column~
ist who wrote for this space
previous to me. “The Sound and
the Fury" lived up to its title,
and now the author is engaged
in lhe work of the Student Couir
cil as its president From what
I've heard and seen. things are
moving along at a promising
pace. -

What happens on the Grinnell
College Campus outside ol the
news columns is going to serve
as material in fill this space.
The situation isn‘t really as
dramatic as all that, but maybe
I can do something for it.
