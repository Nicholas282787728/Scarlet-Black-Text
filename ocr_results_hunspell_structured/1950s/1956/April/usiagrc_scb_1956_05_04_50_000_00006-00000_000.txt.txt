Tm the Editor:

The results oi Chuck Steg—
meir’s survey about the college
paper probably won’t be publish-
ed for a week or so. but here is

a premew or the “adverse critic—
ims“ that got high ratings on
the questionnaires of a sizahle
number of men sudents:

(1)7The sstls doesn’t take
enough of a stand for or against
anything, (z)—it never crusades,
(Slamere is little variety in the
type of stories printed and (4)
eit’s dull in content.

Athletic coverage (especially
frosh and 1M games) was cri-
ticized, as well as a “wide~
spread luck or human inter.
est."

The new Bihler cartoon got

’re rs

hearty applause, but men want
more use or student opinion,
more ~quotes," intervrews, and
Ieatures, better headlines and a
consistent weekly calendar like
other college newspapers.

Although all the questionnaires
are not in yet, we thought this
letter might give you an idea in
which direction to take steps to
improvement.
