By Larry Schleger

Although medical school and
marriage are the important mat-
ters in his near luture, Charlie
Westrup, resolute young man
from Kll‘kwood, Mo, has more
pressing business to attend to
next week—doing his share In
Grinncll's quest for the Midwest
conference track championship.

“II everybody performs up to
what they can do,-we have a
very-good chalice of winning,"
Charlie says, and adds, "It
should be close between Cornell
and us, with Knox an outside
threat,"

Mentions Team Depth

He also noted that in lboth in-
dividual performers, with cap-
tam George Drake singled out
for special mention, and team
depth, Gi-irlnell has the strength.
The conference meet. which will
he held at Grinnell for the first
time since 1947, may very well
be decided on how the points
are split between the other six
or seven teams.

As a ﬁnal note on next
week's meet, Charlie mused,
“I sure wish we could have a

big crowd out there."

Westrup is primarily a hurd-
ler, although he has run where—
cver needed ln relays and dual
meets this year. In last Wednes—
day's triangular, he placed third
in the open quarter and then
came back to‘ wm the 220—yard
low hurdles.

niggest Sports Thrill

Hts biggest sports thrill to date
came in last year’s triangular
wllli Cue and Cornell, when he
ran neclira‘ndsneck with Ryan
Valet of Cornell from start to
finish, The finish judges called
ll. 3 tie, and the tinTe of 124.5 sec»
ends 15 the meet recald

Another thrill came in last
weekend‘s Sioux City and Sioux

The win gave coach Irv si-
lnone’s team a record of two
victories and two ties for the
season. The ties were to Cornell

be the teams to heat in the con-
ference meet.

\Vustrup-Conley nivalry

Charlie says that his friendly
rivalry with Joe Conley in the
hurdles this season has proved a
lot. of incentive. Neither Joe or

Charlie have won both hurdle,

events in a meet this season.
Westrup’s first athletic claim

to fame came as a sophomore
