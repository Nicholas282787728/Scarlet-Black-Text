Gives Reasons
For Election

By Gordon Younger
Within the next week A—
mericans will go to the polls
to decide whether President
Eisenhower or Adlai Steven—
son will lead this nation
(lu ing the next four years.
Since we have peace and
prosperity, you may a
change udmimstrationl”
are [our basic reasons for my
desire to see a Democrat as
President.

Unsonnd Foreign
By tor the most important

reason is the Eisenhower ad-
ministration failure to develop
a sound foreign policy. Even
though we are told by the
President that we are “wlw
ning the pcacc‘ and trial we
have “seized the initiative" in
world affairs, there are many
facts that point in thc opposite
direction.

For example, the Suez Canal
crisis can be directly attriti-
uted to the mismanagement of
Secretary of State, Dulles.
When we offered aid to Egypt,
we should liavc bccn sinccrc,
for withdraniug this aid g" vc
Nasser provocation to nation-
alize the canal, This crisis has
given Russia her first foothold
in the Middle East, something
she has been attempting for
three hundred years.

If this means we are losing
the cold war, we must place
tho blame on tho party in powcr.
I feel that with another four
years of Republican control the
U, 5. might lose its position of
world suprcmacy that it now
so precariously holds.

Lack ct Leadership

, You may wonder why we
have fallen from the unchalr
iengcahlc position we oncc had,
to our pOSltmn today. in my
estimation the main reason is
President Eisenhower's lack of
leadership. Ike may have been
a great general, but. he is not
the dynamic leader the U. S.
needs today.

During the last session of
Congress, lke presented a
school construction bill. In its
final form over one-half of
the Democrats voted for it;
however, over two-thirds ot
the Republicans voted against
it. Ike could not control his
own party. This has been true
{or the last lour years. Tho
Republicans cry, “I Like Ike"
but they refuse to follow him.
Secondly, let us examine his
stand on integration. instcad of
coming out with a forthright
statement and using his great
personal popularity to help
sanei‘ heads prevail, Ilic made

extremely nan—committal
statement It appears that he
attcmpts to remain above all
conflict. This may be the way
to preserve one's personal popu-
larity, but ii. does not providc
‘eadership for a nation.
