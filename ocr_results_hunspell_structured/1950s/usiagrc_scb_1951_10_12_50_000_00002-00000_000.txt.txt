A Few Kind Words
For Jim O’Brien who handles the PA system at fonts
ball games and who did a good job in broadcasting the Gline

nell-Cal‘leton til't' Saturday.

For Nellie Gleason, Whose wonderful picnic for College
waiters and waitresses is still being talked about.

For Lora Lee Pugh, who helped make the quad open
house more successful than it’s been for some time.

And Sumo Not So Kind

For Loose hall women, the only people on campus who
voted down the proposal for contributions to broadcast the

Pioneer-Calls football game.

For the men of Rnwson hall who invited Read women
to be- their guests at dinner Sunday and ill turn were in
excusohly inhospitable and impolite.

After reversing two previous
decisions, the C of HF decided last
night to make a full investiga.
tion into the Younker uprising.
Men who were implicated m the
Monday night fights will be
asked to appear before the c of
HP Thursday,

At their first meeting Tuess
day concerning the pep rally
staged by both Younker units,
the council recommended a $25
fine for each hall, The fine was
thought necessary because of the
fights which broke out on north
campus as a result of the rally.

The second meeting was called
because Jim Mol, south Younker
prcxy, was uninformed of the
first meeting. After two hours
debate in which Clark and Gates
halls figured as aggressors along
with the Younker units, the
council decided to hand the en»
tire affair over to the individual
house councils.

Last night at their regular
meeting the council again took
up the issue. it was argued that

Three Counselors Attend
Convention in Cleveland

Three Grinncll college repre-
sentatlves will attend the annual
convention of the American
council of admissions counselors
in Cleveland, 0., Oct. 14-17.

Those attending are Adcllnc
Pruyn, director of admissions;
Wayne Cooley (physical educac
tion), an Iowa counselor; and
Ruth Somers Winter, associate
director of admissions in the
Chicago office.

The aim of the council is to
create more ethical practices in
schools in admissions depart~
ments. It is working to create
a more friendly feeling between
high schools and colleges in
order to better relations with
prospective college students.

lit was an intershall affair the

 

the c of HP had taken no def-
inite stand in dealing with the
disturbance and if it were to oc-
cur again thcy would be faced
with the same problem. Because

council felt that their previous
decision to refer it to the hall
councils was inadequate. ,
