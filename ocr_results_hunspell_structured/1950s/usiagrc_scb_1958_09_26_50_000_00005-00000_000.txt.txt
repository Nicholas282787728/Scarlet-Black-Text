Once-Beaten Vikings To Be Foes
For Pioneer Gridders Tomorrow

By Walt Jacobson

Football 1958 gets under-
way tomorrow afternoon on
Ward field. Kickoff is sched-
uled for 1:30.

Coach Bob Peterson’s .5oo ball
club (3+2 last year) will host
Appleton, Wisconsin’s Lawrence
college in its first of seven
games. A crowd of a thousand is
expected to be on hand to help
launch what Peterson calls “the
most promising campaign in six
years."

Led by co-captains John Cope-
land and Dave Van Anrooy. the
Pioneers will pit the familiar
names of Lee Moses, Gary Nol-
der, Bud Hulse, Bob Grindey,
Dick Yaki, Bruce Wilkerson and
Jim Simmons. (from left to right
on the line) and Larry Dukes
and Jim Lowry (in the hack-
field) against a young but fast
Lawrence squad.

Having lost their opener to
Coe last week, 14 to 6, the Vik—
ings, boasting lo letterrnen and
quarterback ace, Jim Schulzs,
will come 400 miles to even their
season’s record.

“We're ready," said Peterson,
who has been working his
,team against in improvised
Lawrence offense all week.

The visitors will employ a
multiple offense, using. at var-
ious times either the T-iorma-
tion or single-wing.

Theyve worked these attacks
under actual game conditions,’
Pete added, “and will have just
that much of an advantage. They
have had a good chance to jell.”

The Pioneers will run and pass
from the Tennessee single—wing,
in hopes of “pouring more
through the line a lot faster,’
With practically the same back-
field that played last year, out-
rnnning its opponents by 100
yards, Peterson expects to ex
hibit a greatly improved squad

. "but the rest of the league
is better, too, and I wouldn't
make any predictions,"

Injuries haven’t, as yet,
stood too much in the way at a
bright outlook, Burdctte Abel
and Jack Micheletto, three-
yoar veterans, have been sides
lined, both with knee injuries

Barring any further mishaps—
the squad numbers ai—the op.
timism which has surrounded
daily workouts may realistically
be maintained, The Pioneer line
averages 190 pounds, it’s rough
and experienced. Lowry is the
largest fullback to wear a Grin-
nell uniform in years: 6’1", 195
lbs. His tailback teammate,
c peland, weighs 147 and standsl
5 a and set a Pioneer offensive
record last season.

Weak in passing last year,
the squad should he bolstered
by sophomore Simmons, the
apparent strength of Moses’

Tomolrow afternoon the Grinnell football team meets "‘“W‘ yo“ ”1" ”cogm" What
the Lawrence squad at 1 :30 on Wald field. To some of you
this contest will represent nothing more than 22 men fight-
ing each other for a small oblong spheroid and attempting
to plopel it across one end of the field Many of you who

know something of the game
will be sitting in the Stands
watching a single man for an

hour and a half—the man with
the ball.

ing oi the plays to keep the
defense of! balance, the block-
ing in the line (notice certain
linemen will “pull out" and
lead the interference), the ball
carrier making use ct his
blocking, and finally, on a
pass play, notice that the
probable receivers of the pass
run in a deﬁnite pattern.

A team’s defensive game is
almost as important as its move—
ments with the -ball. The mid—
dle linemen crash in to attempt
to catch the ,ball carrier behind
the line of scrimmage. The de-
fensive ends will try to turn
the play inside and keep the
ball carrier from skirting the
sideline. The key men to ob.
serve on defense are the liner!

Predictions are ridiculous, as
anything can happen, One thing
is for sure, however—this team
is In shape.

By noticing how these open

the pass receiver and the goal
line so i! the receiver does
