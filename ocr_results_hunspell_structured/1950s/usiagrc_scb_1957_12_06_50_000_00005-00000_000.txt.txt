'ioneers To Face , Vikings, Redmen

It’s a big basketball week»
nd as the Pioneers face
wrence tonight and Ripon
Imorrow night. The Pio-
eers, beaten in their season
-ller by North Central, 89-

5, hope to find themselves
l these two games.

Lawrence, whiCh had a

'inless season last year (0- . V-

0) is playing under a new
nach, Don Boya, former
awrence football and baske -
all star. with six returning
ttermen and an outstanding
roup of sophomores, the Vik-
":5 cannot help but improve on
leir record of last year. LAW—
ence opened the season with 3
ss to Lake Forest.

Ripon, sixth in the confer-
nce last year, will have a good
wing attack headed by Gordie
sh, au-conlerence guard. and
ﬁle Kasson, who ranked 19th in
onlerence scoring last year as a
ophomore. Ripon has already
st its first two games against
u loago and Loyola.

‘ “We will have to show dei-

.itc improvement on mouse
as well as deicnse,” remarked
Coach Pntwh aitor the open-
ing loss to North Central.

The Pioneers, who hit almost
0 percent of their shots last
sason, could only hit 29‘percent

the opener. Bob and George
oJimsey each had is points
d John Copeland had 12,
Barge Susens and Bill McClin~
ooh, each playing half the game
t center, garnered 16 points
etween them.

The Pioneers will be play-
ing a banenontrol type game,
at least ior tho early part oi
the season.

Coach Pritsch sees himself as
mug in an unusual position this
ear because he has more than
st five starters to rely on.
. ith this type of team, not
.ucb significance can be placed
n a "starting five.”

Seeing the most action this
eekend will be Bob and George
i imsey, Denny Collis, and
ohn Copeland. with George
usens and Bill McClintock al-
mating at centers

Midwest Conference Preview

Last year's co<titllsts, Gas and
Monmouth, are pre-season iavo-
rites to repeat, but the cooler-
ence seems to have better bal—
ance this year.

con: Once again, Al Pursell,
leading conference scorer for
two seasons, is a nucleus around
which to build a team. The Ko-
hawks also havc.seven letter-
men. Coe's only apparent deﬁ-
ciency is lack oi height.

MONMOUTH: Secondeteam
nominees Jerry McBride and
Bob McKee, together with hon-
orable mention Bob McLoskey
and Tad Yorde, are back, but
Rip Fulton, Monmouth‘s top
scorer, will be missed. Again
the Scots will rely on the strong
defense and competitive spark
which carried them to a tie for
ﬁrst in '53-'57.

KNOX: Allvconference iorword
John Liston and honorable men.
tion forward Gary Hoopes lead
a strong contingent of lettermen.
From last year's strong fresh-
man team must come a replace-
ment tor Joe LaGuess, second-
term ell-conference center.

CORNELL: New coach Paul

Maaslre has a rebuilding job on
his hands. Merle Gaber, whD ﬁn-
ished second to Pursell in scar-
ing, and Leon Smith, honorable
mention center, will be sorely
missed. The Rams will rely on
speed and accurate shooting to
offset a lack of height and of
established stars.

RIPON: With the largest num-
ber of leitermen (10) in the
league, Russ Young can call on
all of last year’s top players.
The loss of two lettermen by
graduation is more than oﬁset
by the return of Ken Stuessi, a
second-team all-Conference cen-
ter two years ago.

ST. OLAF: Under new coach
Bob Colic, the Oles are considr
el-ably Ahead of last year's in-
experienced squad. Gello is
counting heavily on honorable
mention guard Warren Peter-
son, 6’ 7" center Dicl; Steinbech
and sophomores George Miner
and Pete Nest’dnde.

LAWRENCE: Viking material
seems even thinner this year
than last year. Most of the 1956-
57 ﬁrst stringers, including sec-
and-team guard Dick Rine, have

Lynn Kraive, Mel Taube has
probably the strongest pair or
guards in the conterencc. But
the forward wall was shattered
by the graduation of center Dick

honorable mention forward Bill
Walsh. Much depends on 6’5"

sonllomore Center Ivan Grimm.

This year for the ﬁrst time
the All-conference choices were

coaches last week at their Chi-
