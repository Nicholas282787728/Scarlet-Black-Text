men had surrounded the blaz-
ing chair and were watching it
burn. To gain entry with their
equipment, the firemen turned
their hoses on the spectators,
scattpriiig them.

While the firemen put out the
blaze, some men on the loggia
roof began pouring water on
them, wetting several students,
as well as police and'firemen.
Some hoses were turned up
ward to drive students on the

'loggia roof away,

Dean Brown, after attempting
to get the men into their halls.
told the Grinnell police to pick
up any students found outside
during the night. Two men were
apprehended Thursday morning
at about 1:30 a,m., but no
charges were filed against them.
, After the trucks pulled away
from the parking lot back of
Cowlos hall, they moved slowly
down the alley by Ward field,
shining their spotlights on the
dormitories They stopped at
Darby gym and several men
say that the police drove a
group of men back into Youn-
ker hall. -

After a meeting with the c
10 am,
the council
would try to find out who turn-
ed in the alarm to the fire do
and what the source
of the many firecrackers thrown
onto the field that night was.

Fire chiet Fred Taylor, inter—
viewed yesterday, said "we're
not mad. We took some abuse,
and we didn’t like it. but we
have been cooperating with the
college in the past. and will
continue to do so. We need
the college, and the college
needs us."

According to Dean Brown,
there is some question of the
legality of the alarm. He said
that the person who called the
fire department might have
committed a
turning in a false alarm.

cided to give further study to a
lsuggestlon from the Personnel
board that members of the stu»

ltake part in the annual discus-

assist in their enforcement.
This decision came in view of
what the Council considered a
certain vagueness in the board’s
offer. Further study will be
made to determine what is
meant by “social rules" and
what amount of participation the
“students ‘will be alilrywed.

The committee studying the car

will have a partial report pre—

sultations with members of the
social hierarchy, reports from
other schools and student opin-

hoped a definite decision on the
proiccted change would be made
before May 20, at which time
the Social Calendar Committee
will outline next year’s program.

ment week will be
move to specitiod floors.
He explained that the college
wants to do everything possible
to group returning alumni in
graduation classes, because they
are returning primarily to have
class reunions. Last year there
was considerable ineffectiveness
and some criticism because these
groups were not housed together.‘
Every attempt will be made,
Brown asserted, to keep all stud-
ents in their own balls on a
specified floor, as space permits.
He stated that although he
understands and regrets the in
convenience to students that this
may cause, he can see no other
solution to the problem.
