as the Pioneers tangled with

fair grounds diamond.

Tomorrow the Pioneers will
entertain Monmouth‘s Scots in
another Midwest conference can-
test. The public has been invit<
ed to help initiate the season.

Coach Prltsch‘s dlamondmen
are led by a trio of hurlers
including Dick Crawl, Ielty
Bud Roegge and Dwight Nis-
sen.

President Howard R. Bowen
was present today as master of
ceremonies.

Joseph Rosenfieid of Des
Moines opened the affair by
tossing out the first ball.

tain of the 1917 Pioneer team,

tinued, was on hand, as were

sion stand, 1nd music furnish-
ed by a German band.

pecially in the prospects of soph-
omore squad member Dick Katz.

the top spot in singles matches,
and he should get a chance to-

ior Jim Hdutzinger. Also vying
for a position among the top
five is junior Pete Bradford.

vorable results from their'two
