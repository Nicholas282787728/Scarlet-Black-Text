The 1920's are famous tor many things # prohibition, the
Charleston, short dresses and Max Sonnets silent comedies. People
in those days laughed at the antics of the Keystone Kops and
Charlie Chaplin and somehow the humor o‘l'these early efforts in
the motion picture industry has outlasted some of the other char-
acteristics, of the age. The informal social committekcl‘lairman,

Bowen‘s letter predicted sev
eral trends in future educa-
nlon. He said that the “under-
standing of human individual.
lty, the consideration or moral
and religious values, and the
appreciation of the arts will
be needed in 1937 as never
before,” and that hecause of
the role that the UnitedStates

plays in the world, students
will have to give up their“tra—
ditionnl preoccupation with
western cIvillzation" and in-
crease their knowledge of for-
eign languages and cultures of
non-western people,

The shortage of qualiﬁed
teachers, increasing costs, plus
the fact that education will be
extended to many more people
through “newer types of educa-l
tional institutions such as the‘
community colleges, company
night schools, and night schools,"
will necessitate new methods of
education, according to Bowen.
These include the use of elec-
tronic devices, greater use of
independent study and wider
adoption of comprehensive ex-
amjnaticns. Bowen also said that
as this increase in the number
of people in various types of
schools will threaten to lower
the standards of education “the
greatest challenge facing educa-
tors in the next 29 years is to
maintain or improve education-

in lederal aid to schnols and
Salli that “N! better or worse,
we shall come to look upon

education as a national enteh
prise upon which the security
of the nation depends."

He also said that thcrc will
be greater emphasis on science
and technology and that social
psychology and other behavioral
sciences will progress rapidly.
He predicted that there will be
less division between “schools"
and “employment," since many
students will work part time to
“make their lives more mean.
ingful, to raise their scholastic
motivation, and to give them
useful training." Adult education
will expand, he said, and the
average amount of formal edu-
cation will “increase from per
haps 10 years to 14 or 15 years."
