Loucks Shows Six Letterlilen, Nine Sophomores Vie
for Positions 0n Hardwood Varsity

Great Drive
in 6er Play

By Willt Jacobson

Rare is the athlete nliosc
greatest personal reward lies iii
seeing a time loser have
enough do and drive to
“come bael Being a member
of a team that had lost six
straight games, yet fought to a
win in its seventh was the most
rewarding football experience
for one or the highly respected
athlcies on campus 7 Gordon
Loucks

Since joining the Plollecr grid-
ders in was when he came to
this school, Loucks has made a
reputation for himscll as a
ﬁery little backfield man 7 at
half on offense and linebacker
on defense, Standing 5’7" at 155
poiut Grinnell‘s shiity mini-

her “at” would be considered by

many far too small to back up
the center of a delensivc lino.

However, he has ‘proven the
ancumteuess of such an ouixlr
ion unlikely by playing great

football at that position last

Sensoni This year he's had to
fight the injury jinx, and as a
result hasn’t played quite as
much. He was shifted to the
defensive halfback position
where, in spite of the bad
luck, has virtually assured

himself of earning a second
letter in as many years. Coach

Peterson termed him one of
the most cffcctivc ballplaycrs
he's tutored since joining the
athletic department here.

A Mason City high school
graduate, “Gal-die” earned vars-
ity letters in football, basket-
ball, baseball, and wrestling 7
a prized accomplishment tor any
athlete.

From high school he went in
Mason City junior college where
”he studied for two years, then
transfered to Griiinell immed-
iately winning a place on the
varsity, later being elected treas-
urer of the men's Honor G.

The pint sized hut husky
“jock" sports a closely nipped
“crewcut” and can he found
most any time in Darby study- l
ing a physical education text.
Mr. Loucks has hopes of be-
coming a coach His three
point scholastic’ average will
graduate him as a “phys. ed."
major high in his class.

Tomorrow the Pioneers play
St. Olaf. Jersey number “a" will
be worn for the last time this
year. As Grinnell attempts to
win its second in a row, Gordie

‘ Loucks will be out there to lend

a hand in making that “great.-

est personal reward" repeat it-

self.

She sat next to me on the train that day
And a wave of perfume waited my way
—A dangerous scent that is called “l'ni Bad!"
Deliberately made to drive men mad.
I tried to think thoughts that were pure and good
I did the very best that I Could!
But alas, that perfume was stronger than I

I gave her a kiss . i . and got

a black eye!

If kissing strangers has its dangers, in
smoking at least enjoy the real thing, the
big, big pleasure of a Chesterﬁeld King!

more smoothly by AcGUrRuy.
