Last Thursday and Friday
night, WRA's “daughter" organi-
zatlon, white Caps, presented
their annual water ballet. I use
the term “daughter" because
'hite Caps, although not a di-
- t part of WIRA activities, gets
‘15 entire financial budget
.rom the Larger clulb. Dues are
ollecied train the girls, ,hut they
are used ror picinics and other
such activities.

’llhe Show italf lasts only about
one and a half hours, but is the
net result of about five months‘
preparation. Beginning in The
first of the school year rwiﬂl try-
outs (which even the old meims
ibers mat go through), the Show
is developed through the stages
of theme selection, actual record
.ecision, routine write-ups, dry-
land practices, water trials and
revisions, and final penfecticm
drills. One girl is chosen as the
leader or each group and is res—
ponsible for selecting recou‘ds,
writing up her outline, and su-
pervising the entire development
oi her part at the show.

The tryouts include three or
four strokes and a felw basic
stunts, and are not designed so
Lhat only expert swimmers will
pass. 0n the contrary, they are
very hasic and fair tests of gen-
eral ability; and, to insuure in»
partiality on the part of the
judges, each swimmer is identl»
iicd by number.
