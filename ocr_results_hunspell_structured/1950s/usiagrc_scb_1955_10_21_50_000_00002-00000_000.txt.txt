SCARLET AND BLACK

The Sound
and
The Fury

There seems to be another
tempest brewing in the Grinnell
teapot. In the interest of catch-
ing it before it boils over, ’l'd
like to straighten out the Central
Committee’sdecisionon the ap-
portionment of the Social fee;
more particularly the allotment
to KGRW.

KGRW was given approxi»
mately $1315 for the school
year of 1954—55. The estimated
budget submitted no the Cen-
tral Committee was for $1375.
The 3500 dollar increase was
for outstanding bills; hills for
new cable which was neces-
sitatcd by a ruling by the
FCC,

The Central Committee felt
o’hligated to put aside enough
money ,for a name band since
that had been the wish of the
majority of the students. Fun
thermore since more students
wanted the band for a dance
than for a concert, the commit.
tee set aside $1200 for that pur-
pose. Had the choice been for a
concert, 3 smaller sum would
have sufficed. The outstanding
bill on Lake Acre took another
$300. .

n was therefore decided to
out KGRW’S budget temporar-
ily. Since all other scelions of
the budget were vital to the
station’s life, the biggest out
came in the remote broadcasts
area. It was decided to award
1(an $975 tor the fist sc-
mcsler and approximately
$400 for the second semester.
It was decided that if the ap—
portionment oi the second se-
mcslci- fee made it possible
KGRW would receive the full
budget. '

.KG‘RW’S budget had been
drawn up using the prices of one
of the Largest distrl'butors of
radio parts. By dill‘lgent effort
and hard work the staff heads
found that they could have ap-
proximately 365 by buying from
a multitude of smaller compan-
183. They decided to throw in
the difference and do a remote
broadcast of the Carleton game.
A misunderstanding on the
part of certain Committee mem-
hers led to a premature charge
of bad faith, when no such
charge was needed or deserved.
The matter was blown up
all out of proportion in SW
ceeding days. I believe I speak
for the entire Central Com-
lnittee when 1 say that we
are not nnti-KGRW, anti-
remotes, anti-football, on anti
school spirit. 1 hope this
straightens out the whole
mess, in some measure at
least.

While We are on the subject
of doorbell, rd like to say a
word about spirit. It seems that
spirit is running higher this year
than it has for a long time. For
one thing the team has given
the lie to those cynics who say,

“Grinnell’s a great little School

but it’ll never have a good foot-
ball team.” The crushing defeats
inflicted upon Lawrence and
Ripon indicate that better days
are upon us. There is one thing,
however, that I believe could
raise the interest even more.

Grinnell has traditional rivals
in Carleton, C02, and Cornell.
It would be a fine lhing if we
could ' institute a traveling
trophy between ourselves and
one of these schools. It would
go to the winner of the game
each year in the manner of the
