ester, President Howard Bowen
announced at a meeting of the
Air Force cadets this morning
in ARH auditorium,

Bowen stated that, “No defin—
ite decision has been made, how»
ever I shall recommend that

of the second semester.” This
was one of two alternate deci—
sions which confl‘onled the col—
lege. One was to cut the unit

leges and universities are in this
phasing out process.

‘Thel'e is no evidence that I
can find that draft boards have
determined the status of indie

The reason as given by Mr.
Smith for discontinuing the unit
at Griiiiiell as well as the other
colleges is that the function of
the AFROTC is to put forth
officers and that there was not
a sutficient quantity of officers
produced to make die venture

has been sending out commis-
sioned officers at the rate of ape
proximately thirteen a year.

Lt. Colonel Clarence E. Sum-

of any failure on the part of the
