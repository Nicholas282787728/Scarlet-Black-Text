Council Announces
Decorations Rules

The final rules and regu-
lations for Homecoming Dec-
orations were stated by the
Student Council last night.
A maximum of $25 has been
set for each hall to spend
for its decorations.

Decorations can be attached to
the loggia andlor root with rope,
wire, or masking tape. However,
the women students are not al—
lowed to climb on the roof or
the loggia as it is weak in some
points; therefore ladders arc to
be used.

In connection with this,
Norman Marble (building and
grounds) has stated in a let-
ter to the council, that the
students may borrow any tools
or equipment the department
may have.

The main emphasis of his let-
ter is concerned with the tact
that the buildings’and grounds
of the campus, may be in no
way damaged. H for any pur~
pose the hall should want to
use college linen in their theme,
it too, must not be damaged or
the hall will be charged for it,

Halls are urged‘ to have fire
extinguishers on hand, as
paper decorations arc consid-
ered inflammable,

dent, will act as chairmanof
