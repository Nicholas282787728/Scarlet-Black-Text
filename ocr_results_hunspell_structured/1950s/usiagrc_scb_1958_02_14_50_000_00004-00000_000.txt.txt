Males Alert To Avoid Female Snare;
Fall Prey To ‘Ringing Valentine Belles'

By A Beau >

Last year at this time there appeared in the Set riot
& Blaelt a Feature article on how to “tie a Valentine beau.”
"this a) ltel was definitely slanted toward the .u'ishes 01'
south campus. This year it was felt that the other side of

the story should be told.

From the female point oi
view thc'iiiaiii object in lite is
to “tie a beau" around hcr little
ﬁnger. Looking at it trom the

male angle. the diliiculty lies
in trying not to “ring a Valen»
.tine belle.” Thereiore, the male
must be on guard at all times
to make sure his neck doesn't
get caught in tho noose of thc
knot, nor the ring through his
nose.

The first thing that all
males must remember is that
the majority or temales at»
tend college in order to ob-
tain their “Mrs." degree. This
-is a basic tact. 0n the other
hand, the female must realize
that the male may not intend
to be tied in knots according
to schedule . her schedule.
The typical south campus
schedule runs something like
this: to go steady by Valcns
tine's day at the girl‘s tresh—
man year; to be pinned by the
same day her sophomore year;
to tighten the knot during.her
junior year, and to get the ring-
by Valentine's day her scnior
year.

it can plainly be seen that
the male, no matter what year
he may he, must be extra
carctul during this time of
the yedre—pnrticularly today.
It tits somewhere into the fee
mate’s schedule. It by the
time you’re reading this, it
isn’t too late, then take heed.
Be on guard throughout the
rest at the evening.

It you succeed in doing this
you may be sate. However, the
chances are very slim. No mat-
ter what the male may do to
try to escape being caught in
the Valentine knot. the temale
Will no doubt win out. She
always does.

Therefore, it might save a
lot of time and energy it the
male just gives‘ in and allows
the temale to win her battle.
in the end she will anyway. So,
it the male will learn the above
schedule and take the approprlr
ate actions, he too may bc one
of the millions who “ring a
Valentine belle."
