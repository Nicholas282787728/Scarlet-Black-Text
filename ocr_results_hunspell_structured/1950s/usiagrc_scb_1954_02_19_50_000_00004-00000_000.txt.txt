lCoach Cldsses Carl Couve

iAs ‘Chips-Down’ ‘Crappler

by Rod AJniliic

Carl Couve is an
more than one way.

Besides his extrordinary tal-
ent with the paint brush, he
demonstrates additional artistry
on the wrestling mati (it you
don’t believe it, try going to
a Grinnell wrestling match
sometime and watch Cauve do
his specialtyepile up points for
lthe Pioneers.)
Couve started grappling as a
isophomoi-e in high school in
Park Ridge, 111,, and has since
lcompiled an eye—catching record
lror himself. He won lourth
place in the Midwest conference
meet two years ago and copped
second last year. So far this
year he has won three, lost
three and tied one. Carl’s out-
standing feat this season .was
when he pinned Nebraska’s 137
pounder in 49 seconds flat.

Coach Bob Peterson says,
“Couve is a reel pressure per—
iormer who is at his best when
the chips are down."

When asked how married lite
has allected his wrestling, cisrl,
who married during Christmas
vacation replied, “It sure beats
dorm life For one thing, I’m
now on a much better diet than

 

artist in _

l

before.”

Couve's extra-cm cular activ-
lities have consisted of being an
editorlfor the Cyclone, Scarlet
and Black business manager and
a member or Langan‘s house
council.

After his visit with Uncle
‘Sam, Couve plans to enter the
lcommel‘cial art field.
