Group Desnes More Recreation; Snow Provides Lake Acre Fun
Wants Suggestion for Activities

by Chuck Stegmeir
Does tobogganing sound

like fun to you? OI would

you lather attend a peiformance in Des Moines of “The
Teahouse of the August Moon" with 21 group of othel stu-

dents? Does the idea of an

overnight canoe tlip on the

Iowa liveI flom Malshalltown to Bellevue seem exciting,
or would the chance to see thel Metlopol ltan opela company
peI'folm “La Boheme" make your blood 5th a little!

These varied recreational ac-
tivities and many more are now
available to Grinnell students
for the askin". None will be
come realities, however, unless
some individuals are interested
enough to suggest them and
indicate enthusiasm for them,

In recognition of the lack oi
recreational activities on the
Grinnell campus, and In a des
sire to meet this need, the Grin-
nell faculty has created alrec-
reational committee composed
of four students and has named
a faculty advisor on recreation
for the student council.

This student committee has
full power to sponsor any recre-
ational activities the Students re
quest and to try out any ideas
it considers good The faculty
advisor on recreation will also
sit in on the committee in
order to help clear any ob-
stacles to their plans that migh1
arise in providing transportas
tion, food, or equipment.

Members of the committee
are Tom Boe, informal social
chairman, Molly Walsh, Janet
Wenthe, and Nick Ryan. Irv
Simone is faculty advisor,

The committee will be con.
cerned primarily with trying
out and sponsoring two types
oi activities, those connected
with Lake Acre and those in
volving trips to Des Moines,
other schools, etc. It Will not
encroach on the duties of
groups now working In the
area of campus recreational ac~
tivilies but will try to supp1e~
merit and aid their plans.

The committee will be espec-
ially concerned with Lake Acre
since it oﬂers Grinnell students
the biggest recreational outlet.
Up to this point In the school
Year, Lake Acre has been used
only for ice skating, toboggan-
ing and skiing. Other possible
Winter and {all activities in the
area Include organized pheas-
ant; rabbit. and duck hunting,
sleigh riding and a '
nival. Spring activ
the committee will consider are
fishing, trail rides, hall picnics
(mixed), overnights, and swim—
ming.

Reaction to such proposals
as bus trips to Des Moines for
concerts, plays, musicals, opera.

and skating, and buses to away.

Sports‘ events for interested
students will be determined.

‘Since the committee is inter-
ested in providing activities
that will appeal to all students,
it is hoping for suggestions of
all kinds, Boe said. Ideas that
have been tried previously or
that are completely new, no
matter how unusual, will the
welcomed. To make it easier
for students to submit their
ideas, a suggestion box has been
placed In the Union. The coin-
rnittee will meet Weekly to
consider. suggestions and make
plans.

Associated with the recreation
commimee in handling Lake
Acre is the Lake Acre planning
IcommIttee which makes policy
decisions for the land, While the
recreation Committee will book
all activities through Simone,
the planning committee will
draw up all rules.

Arrangements must be made
for use of the camping area and
the cabin. Bus transportation for
any group of 32 or more should
the ‘booked through Simone.
Round trips will cost $8.00 per
Ihus trip. smaller groups should
try to cycle, ride holsclbaclf, or
arrange tI-anspontlitIon through
their club Sponsor.

Most Important of the rules
set up for Lake Acre are those
conccrnlng drinking, hours or
use, and charges. Drinking Is

undel the same IegulatIon at
Lake Acres rs on the campus
Groups not staying
must leave b; 10 p m. on week
nights and 11 p. m. on week-
ends. Overnight groups must
leave Ihc college as a unit and
(Irrive at the cabin by s p m,
The change for overnight will no

Student Progress
In W. U. S. Drive

This year’s World Univers-
ity Service drive is off to at
good start. Ken Kassebaum
and Gail Pomrehn, WUS co-
chairmen, report the Grln»
nell students are responding
enthusiastically with their dol»
lars to this student-toestudeno
service.

Albert Mark spoke to the
hall solicitors lat Sunday af-
ternoon. He managed to instill
an enthusiasm into these stu»
dents which has been passed
on to a majority of other stu-
dents. Because World Univer-
sity Service is the only stu-
dent-to»student service in the
world It seems imperative that
American college students unite
through their campus drives.

Besides the solicitation, Grin-
nell's WUS shall sponsor the
annual auction dance on Sat—
urday, March 12. Jim Wohlner,
station manager, yesterday said
that a week later, on March 19,
KGRW will sponsor a “radio-
thon" which will take pledges
ror requests to hear records.
Last year WUS earned over $50
from this event and It is hoped
that such a response can be re.
peated.
