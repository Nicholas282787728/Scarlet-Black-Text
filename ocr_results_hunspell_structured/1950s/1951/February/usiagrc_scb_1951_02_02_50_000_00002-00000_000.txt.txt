Four weeks from tomorrow _
dential race will be narrowed to two candid
weeks from today is too late to start thinking a
candidate to support. . 4 .

It's not merely a question of letting the official dele-
gates choose the final candidates at the nominatlng con-
vention. The time for thinking about the right person to
head our student govemment for the next year Is now.
Much has to be accomplished in these next four weeks.

The six member election committee will be ready to
receive petitions from February 16 to 22. Are we to be
faced again with the dilemma of having only three candi-
dates from which to choose the final two or of having the
deadline date extended to see if just another one or two
petitions will come in? _ ‘ >

The student council presidency Is an important Job.
It means more than the routine matters of seeing that the
coke machines are in Working order and whether or not
the swimming pool should be open on Sunday afternoons
The student council .pl‘esident is the spokesman‘for our
whole system of student government It is possible that

on one person this system may either stand or fall.
We must find the right person!

Tuesday ’3 the Day

e have to get down on our hands and
knees and beg for people to take the best jobs the campus
has to offer? It sounds illogical, but it‘s a fact.

Six of those jobs are crying for talent now. By Tues-
day they’ll be absolutely yelping. The board of publica-
tions will be choosing editors and business managers for the
three student managed publications that afternoon Should
jobs that pay from $175 to $400 have _to be begmng?

A person doesn‘t have to be a child prodigy to apply.
The business managers’ jobs require mainly a Willingness
to work and a clear business-head. To be an editor. one Is
not expected to know all the ins and outs of the publication.
The semester breaking—in peiiod will iron out those diffi-
culties. ‘

The successful applicants will be doing themselves and
the school a favor by not permitting procrastination to set
in before Tuesday.

He's often wished he'd never
started. He sometimes has want—

ham, senior English major, is
about half done with his honors
project and things are looking
up a bit.

Honors projects are available
to seniors who have an average
of at least 87% with 90% in
their major fields. Interested
students make an independent
study of an area pertaining to
their major. If their finished
work is satisfactory, and are
able to pass oral comprehensives,
they are Eraduated with honors.

Dickinson‘s Death Poems

Another ambitious English ma—
jor is Bob Bredeson. Smith sen-
ior. His study concerns the
death poems of Emily Dickinson.

He became interested in her
work through his own reading
and a course in American
writers. Since his study is main—
ly his own ideas and opinions,
his reading has been limited
mostly to her poetry. Another

it feels that if we are to ace
cept the social customs of our
day, We should learn to practice
them in our dining room as a
part of our education.

The Council believes that the
dining room should be one in
which any student will be com-
fortablc and, at the same time,
one in which he will feel per-
fectly at ease in entertaining his
parents or guests.

For these reasons, and in an
attempt to maintain this type of
dining room, the C. of HP. has
set down certain rules and regu-
lations governing the dress and
conduct in the dining room. In
cases where the Council feels
that certain persons are attempt-
ing to disrupt or destroy this
type of dining room, it feels ob-
ligated to take some sort of ac-
tion to correct them. In these
cases the Council has arrived at
a definite policy of discipline in
