of the Iowa State campus at:

Ames when the Grinnell swim-
ming team pits its fortunes
against a powerful Iowa State
aggregation, one of the topl
squads in the Big Sevenr ,

The Pioneer team dropped a‘
meet to Gustavus Adolpus yes-,
terday. after splashing their \vayl
to victory over Knox last week
end.

Until the 400-yard free—style
relay yesterday, the meet was
in doubt, but by sweeping thatl
event, Gustavus triumphed 474
23. Again Jack Edgren's two}
firsts were bright spots in the:
Scarlet and Black's performance.
Other standouts of the afternoon
were Jim Brown and Skip King-l
ery who placed first and second
in diving, and Jim Stocker's two
seconds in the nil-yard and the
440»yard freestyle. ,

By smashing three previous;
varsity records, Coach Kenyon}
A. Knopi’s swimmers swamped,
Knox 59.25 and chalked up theirl
second victory of the season last,
week. Leading the record—sch,
ting parade was ,Edgren’s :54.8;

the backstroke and the new 4004
yard free style relay record of‘
3:533 set by Gerry Allen; Risse,i
Bob Zeitler, and Edgren. Edgren
took two firsts and swam on
the record—breaking dooeyard
free style relay team. Knox's
only first place was taken by
Lechner who barely edged out
Grinnell's Zeitler in a hard-
fought race.

Cowles Leads

In IM Race

With only 180 points separat—
ing the first place hall, Cowlcs,
from the last place hall, Smith,
the most vigorously contested
McMurray trophy race since the
war is in progress.

The teams are so tightly
bunched that the bowling meet,
scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow, and
the wrestling tournament book—
ed for Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday of next week could re-
scramble the entire standings.
First place Cowles with 860
points has a slim twenty point
edge on its nearest rival, Lao-j
gan, with Langan only holding a
precarious twenty point margin
on Gates.

Each Hall will be represented
by a five man bowling team
with each team playing three
lines; highest total score wins.
The wrestling preliminaries will
take place next Tuesday and

Around the

By Mack Wright

Well, it's just about that time;

‘anothet season of scorched hoops

is on its way out. Grinnell’s four
graduating seniors, playing in
their last games for the Scarlet
and Black, know this better than
anyone. Coach Pfitsch reminis-
cing, termed Dave Dunlap and
Bob Bigelow as being key men
in supplying much of the drive
and scoring punch for three
fine teams. Both have developed
all-conference reputations and
according to Coach Pfitsch are
‘well feared in the league.” This
is as fine a tribute as can be
paid to two boys who will be
missed greatly next year.

As for Walt Pokoj and Chet
Lacy, be dealt liberally in his
terms of praise. “They have
Worked hard and contributed
time. energy, and cooperation ——
always exhibiting fine attitudes
Team play and the welfare of
the squad has always meant
more to them than their own
glory. This is the attitude we
need, and we shall surely miss
them for both their playing abil-
ity and their wonderful atti-

ludes."

Now, we shift the spotlight

from our own campus to that oil

conference champs in the has

and Associated Press for this

Sharing the spotlight with his
