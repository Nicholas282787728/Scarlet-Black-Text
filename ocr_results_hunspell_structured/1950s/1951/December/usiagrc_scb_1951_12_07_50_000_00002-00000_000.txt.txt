Believe It or Not

The S&B is breaking a precedent! We want to say nice‘
things about “school spirit.” Such a topic usually prov1des,
grist for the mills which are high school newspapers. The
editors rant and rave, usually with justification, about the‘
lack of “school spirit” at various athletic events. ‘

Such editors, pens bent and broken, would be especiallvl
happy if they had heard the lusty spontaneity of Grinnell
college fans at Saturday‘s basketball game with North Cen-
tral. The enthusiasm and spirit which Grinnellians showed
at that time provides a source of grateful amazement. We!
hope it will continue.

Another hearty slap on the collective backs of the col-
lege band and Director Otto Jelinek, This year the organiza—
tion can be called a band with no apologies to John Phillip,

School for Scandal , E

Grinnell‘s “open door policy" has been a valued and
valuable practice. Faith in it is' being destroyed, however,
by the number of thefts which have taken place recently. ‘

It is a good thing to be able to trust one’s fellow men.
The college and its students have encouraged that trust.
The college does not issue keys to dormitory rooms; its stu-
dent leaders tell new students they can put their belongings
anywhere on campus and they will still be there when the
owners return. We wish they had basis for their trust.

But money has disappeared from rooms and clothes,
have disappeared from clothes lines. Fifty dollars worth of
decorations is missing from the Gadabouts storeroom in the
women’s gym. Five prints and two songbooks are missing,
from the recent Mortar Board print sale in Cowles,

The S&B will act as a receiving station for red and
white checkered tablecloths, and prints by Grosz, Kent,
Marquet, Monet and Signac. If you have them, return them. i
No questions will be asked. ‘

Frank Lederel' and the rest of

the men of Gates tower have
formed a musical society called
the Tower Rats. They all have
real cute names which have dou-
ble meanings and if you’reinthe
know you can understand them.
if you’re not, any one of the
Rats will be glad to offer an
explanation, complete with il-
lustrations and gestures.

I just wonder how many of
the ladies over at the quadran-
gle are hep to this kind of men-
tal vomit. I asked one gal what
she thought of the recital and
she said that it was a “scream.”
if she was screaming when l
was screaming, she’s been con-
cealing something about her
past.

The Tower Rats should be a
clever group, judging from the
brilliant personnel. Their new
sound is really new. I sure
hope they can do something
with those jokes,

I wonder if Bill Warden,
North Central’s high scoring
center, gets kissed by the coach
after every basketball game.
Or, is that the Conventional re-
ward for meritorious service?
They’d better be careful or
they‘ll both be out for the sea-
son with impetigo.
if you want to get the real
lowdown on the central Iowa
sporting scene, just drop in on
old Ave and Homer at the Fifth
Avenue barber shop. Those two
ought to take over the sports
page for the Des Moiues Regis-
ter. They know everything from
shoe sizes to the coaches' maid—
en names,

What's more, they‘re real Pi-
oneer fans. Their shop is one
place in town where you can
hear nice things said about John
Ffitsch.

Cowles hall has a new addi-
tion named Hermie. He does
add jobs around the dorm; a
jack of all trades but mastered
by none.
