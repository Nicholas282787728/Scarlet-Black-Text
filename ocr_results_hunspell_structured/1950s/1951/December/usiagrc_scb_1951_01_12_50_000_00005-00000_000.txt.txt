Pioneers Vie For SeCond pace

Take on Car|e+on
In Toss-Up Mafch

The Pioneers, encouraged by
their three game winning streak,
play their most important game
of the season tonight against
a very good Carleton five at
Northfield. A Grinneil victory,
provrding Beloit beats Knox toe
marrow, would give the Pioneers
undisputed possession of second
place, A Carleton triumph would
do the same for them.

The game’s a toss up, neither
team being favored. Both hold
3‘1 conference records, Carlee
ton losing to Beloit by 14 points
while the Scarlet and Black
were dropping a heart»breaklng
one—point decision to Cornell.

The Knights boast a 7—2 rec—
ord thus far this season along
with the tallest team in the con-
ference. Their rebounding has
always been particularly effecc
tive against the Pioneers. This
more than any other single fac<
tor cheated Grinnell.out of sec.
ond place in the conference last
year.

Coach Mei Taube, head has-
ket hall mentor at Purdue last
season, has four returning sen-
iors on his starting five along
with a fi-ft.,li—inch sophomore
center. Carleton works from the
single post, using a fast break
variation off this offense.

The Maize have achieved par
excellence in balance scoring,
with all six of their top scor-
ers having collected over so
points in the night games play
ed, Chuck Marck, the quarter—
back who passed the Maize to
two quick touchdowns to drop

Grinnell in the last 30 seconds-

of the game, is-also the Carls’
chief basketball threat, having
scored 91 points thus far this
season. Captain Curt Carleton
has 89, Elton Brooks 68,.Clyde
Slocum 61, and Bill Addington
58.

Around the

By Phil Bonnet

Although Grinnell may be
just another small college west
of the Mississippi, known only
locally for its basketball suc-
cesses. big Dave Dunlop rocket-
ed himself and the school into
national prominence this week,
by taking over third place in the
country's small college list of
top basketball scorers.

in fairness to those teams that
play smaller schedules, the Nat-
ional Collegiate Athletic Bureau
makes individual scoring awards
on the basis of per game aver-
ages rather than total points
scored. Dave's masterful 26.8
game average earned for him
the nation’s third spot ranking
behind the torrid pace setting of
Scallion and Steagall. Scallion
from Washington college tops
the heap with 39.3 average while
Steagall from Millikin follows
-with a 29.6 game average. Ac
cording to my figures, Beioit’s
Ron Bontemps, Dunlop's ace ri-
val in the conference, failed to
make the nation’s top ten.
Dunlop Tops Peisner‘s Record

What few people realize is:
that Dunlop is setting a new
Grinnell basketball record every
time he scores. It was on the
night of December 29 against
Morningside in the Christmas
tournament that Dave's as points
not only broke the old tourna-
ment and field house record for
most points scored in any one
game. but also put him two
Ipcints over Earl Peisner’s all-
time scoring mark.
l Dave has now scored more
basketball points than any ath-
lete in the history of the school.
While it took Earl Peisner four
years to set the old record (he
benefited from the wartime re-

laxation of the freshman rule),
Dave broke it in less than 2V2
seasons of play. Peisner amassed
his personal collegiate grand tee
tail of 754 points insthe 1945750
season.

Dunlop has now 323 points
and if he Continues to score at
his present rate he wlll collect.
over 1,100 points by the time he
graduates in June. With ten
games left in is collegiate career,
barring injuries, Dunlop needs
only 172 points to reach the
coveted grand total of 1000
points, a record so few athletes
achieve.

Although it seems unlikely
that he can malhtain his phe-
nomenal 26.9 scoring average, it
seems just as unlikely that he
would fall below a 172 mark
which is the minimum require—
ment he needs for the 1000
points. Dave now holds, barring
none, every individual mark in
Grinnell’s record book.

' Grinnell Takes Third

Coach Pfitsch's charges are be- ‘

ginning to live up to their pre-
season press notices. The Flu»
neers took a very creditable
third in the recently expanded
North Central Conference tour»
ney, upsetting highly favored
Iowa State Teachers 63.60 in the
first game. it was this win that
catapulted us into the top half
of the tournament.

Unfortunately, against Morn—
ingside the 'follawlng night,
Grinnell exhibited the deleter~
ious effects of its two week va-
cation lay—off. The uut-of—candi-
tion Pioneers ran out ‘of scams
inn and succumbed not to a bet
ter team, but to a better condir
tioned club 76-64,

light this afternoon as the Grin»
nell gi- nt and groan boys open-
ed their 1951 season against
Carleton at Nortfield,

Coach Brown took along eight
Pioneers including two latter
men. The Scarlet and Black meet
Carleton with hopes of duplicat—
ing last year’s duel meet vic—

The returning lettermen mak-
ing the trip are Chuck Burd.
147 lbs., and Bernie cakes, 177
