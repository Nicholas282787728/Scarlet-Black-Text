Sievens Tells ,
School Group
Beloii Deiails

Why Beloit was expelled from
the Midwest conference and how
it can be readmitted was ex-
plained to student leaders and
faculty members at a meeting
in President Samuel Steven’s
office Tuesday night.

It was agreed that Beloit had
violated the spirit and letter
of the Midwest conference, Spas
cific charges were that Beloit
did not respect the conference
tradition in respect to scheduling
games or having faculty control
of athletics, ’

Beloit did not maintain the
spirit of intercollegiate athletics
in terms of practicevperiods for
various sports. It was declaredi
that individuals connected with
athletics should not have subsi—
dization from any source where-i
by they could participate in thel
profits.

The principle of subsidization
is not in the conference. Accordw
ing to conference policy, alh~
letic directors should nc'n. solicit
athletes to come to their schools
to try out

Attending the meeting were
representatives of central com-i
mittee, student Council, and the
Midwest conference of student
governments committee. Fae»
ulty members who attended
were Joseph Charlton (eco-
nomics). Kenyon Knopf (ec
nomics). Henry Brown., (physi-
cal education), and Christian
Gruber (English).
