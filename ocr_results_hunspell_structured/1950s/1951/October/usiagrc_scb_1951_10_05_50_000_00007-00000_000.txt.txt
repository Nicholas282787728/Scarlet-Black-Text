noon. It will be the Pioneers'
first game on foreign‘soil. ,

Wally Hass has tour or the best
man in the conference at their
respective positions. All were
all~conference choices last year.
Slocum, however, may see only
limited action due to a knee in-
jury. which kept him out of his
squads opener. .

The lVIaize‘ have already
played two loop games, In their
opener they bested Cornell 12—0,
but last week they fell before
defending co-champion Knox
