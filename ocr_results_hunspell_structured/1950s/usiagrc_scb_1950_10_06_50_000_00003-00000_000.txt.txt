And Lalch on Fas‘l

The first Quad Open House
was held last Saturday, Sep-
tember 30. Because it was agreed
that this year decorations were
to be kept to a minimum, most
or the halls confined their dec—
orations to the bulletin boards.

A new teature of this year’s
pcn house was dancing in the
loggia to the music or the Com»
be, The lounges were open for
card playing, and the annual
variety show, emcee’d by Pete
Carleton, was held in the little
theatre. The prop halls gave
original skits, there were severe;
al solos, and the finale, a pot-‘
pourri of songs from “Up Al
Tree," was presented as a mem-
orial to Stu Roeder, last year’s
Gadabouts chairman, who.pl‘o»

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
Number 2 .TI‘IE BLOW,FISH'

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Shucks—I blew in when I should’ve blown out!”

 

 

 

Ely the pom Piscis! He’s been making all those
trick cigarette tests you’ve been reading about! He’s taken one puﬁ of this
brand —one sniff of that. A quick inhale oi cigarette “A” is fast exhale
of cigarette “B” 7 and he’s still confused! Seriously, isn’t the sensible way to
test a cigarette to smoke pack after pack, day after day?
That’s the test Camel asks you to make —
the 30-Day Miltlness Test. Smoke Camels — and
only cemelseregularly tor 30 days. Your “T«Zune”
(T tor Throat and T icr Taste)— is the real proving
ground for any cigarette. After you‘ve tried Camels

as your regular smoke, you’ll know why...

More People Smoke Camels
than any other cigarette!
