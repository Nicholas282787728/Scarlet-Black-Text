It ’8 Too Tough

Five individuals 7 two freshman women, one junior
man, and two freshman men —- no longer enjoy tlle priv—
ileges of attendance at Grinnell college.

FO‘Il/J ' Idents were suspended for cleaiucut vi -
iations of the d ing rule. The other, a man, was suspend»
ed for keeping a car All the men were suspended for the
rest of the semester, but there is some doubt as to the
length of the gil‘ls’ suspensions.

None of those suspended will receive rebates on fees
paid for this semester, All debts they have contracted with
the college remain as debts due. None will be able to get
transcripts from Grinnell until they have paid all debts.

All five of the students were dismissed during the
Homecoming weekend; and the timing, whether planned or
not, undoubtedly was a major factor in the quietest, most
sober Homecoming that present generation Grinnelllans
can remember. ‘ >

This situation presents both a bright and a dark side.
At least the administration now has a rule which is being
enforced as it stands, and in the manner which the rule
states. That is good.

But the wisdom of a semester’s suspension for the first
offense can be seriously doubted, The two freshman women
had barely a month and a half in which to adjust to new
Surroundings and a new freedom.

One of the men was a veteran. While the Dean of
Men's office says that he may return next semester under
the G. 1. Bill, he has still lost one semester of his veteran's
privileges.

The other men were not veterans, and both were 20
years old. It’s a serious question as to whether those two
men’s draft boards will continue their deferments through
a three month suspension period.

To make the penalty for the first offense 3. two week,
suspension seems to be a much wiser course. A student
would still be penalized, and penalized heav11y, but would;
not lose the entire semester in which the offense occurs.

A second offense could fairly result in a semester
suspension; and a third offense seems to indicate such.

lack of responsibility that the college would be justifiedl
in permanently expelling the offender. l

Whatever is wise, or just, the problem is one whichI
student government has an obligation to take up. The Stu-l
dent Council, C of HP and League Board should all con-

sider it carefully.

SCARLET AND BLACK
Harold R. Harding

Alumni Secretary

The appointment of Harold R.
Harding cs alumni secretary at
Grinnell college has been an-
nounced by President Samuel
N. Stevens and director of pub—
lic relations Herbert Prescott.

A native oi Chicago and Palos
Park, 111., he attended Grinnell
college and the Universily of
Chicago. receiving his A. B. de-
gree from the latter institution
in 19 -

though, because there was no
washing machine. And besides
that most of the good WMP
agitators had graduated, It
looked like a bad year.

But gradually things improve
ed. A new type of WIVLP man
evolved—in place of the coarse
cynic of yesterday came thel
philosophical, tradition-building'
sockrwasher, well equipped with
Tide and plenty of time be-
tween five and six sun.

It was a change for the bet-

‘ter 'and we got a lot of new

recruits when the WM? some
what mysteriously came to rest
with the c of HF. We began
voting in housemeetings again
and l dutifully stood up for
the.washing machine, content
that things were getting back
to normal.

Now another year has begun
and the c of HP tells us that
they’ve actually bought a wash-
ing machine. But 1 don’t be-
lieve it. And 1 don’t want to
believe it. Because after all
these years I’ve come to think
that there's something rather
mundane and temporal about a
washing machine on North
Campus; something that's not
quite congenial with the Grin-
nell Community and the Boar’s
something like
cars and good wine, intrinsically

;hound to foster poor citizenship.

And so it is that l urge you
to abandon your melcontent
ways and join the ranks of the
resigned sock washers. You'll
sleep better if you do.

Sincerely yours,
Bill Wilcoxen

all this changed.

 

Two years ago the WM? got
the best of me for awhile. The
Student Council said the Col-
lege couldn’t find a place to
put a machine and after cone
siderable thought 1 concluded
that the College Laundry and
the Administration were in
league against us having a
washing machine. i decided to
start a laundromat, With three
or four machines, the old Grin-
nell Spirit. and some advertis-
ing, i thought 1 could make a
go of it. All 1 needed was a
lime capital so i tried to in.
terest people in buying slock,
but things didn't go too well and
rho sock pile got so high that
finally 1 took to getting up at
five in the morning and wash-
ing things for an hour. I fi-
nally got so tired i had to give
up the laundromat idea. Took
what washing machine money
there was and turned it into
‘Sam For Senator’ buttons for
the '52 campaign in an effort
to make a quick profit. 1 still
hope to use these some day but
at the time they didn’t sell and
so the wivu1 was still unsolved.

It was late the next summer
that a letter came saying that
North Campus would have a
washing machine when we got
back. 1 was skeptical but the
letter had such a Come-Hell-
