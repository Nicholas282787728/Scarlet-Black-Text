since winning the Rachman-
inoff Rind award in 1948 and
with it the -titie of ”foremost
young pianist in the United
suites," Lipkin has concentrated
on a keyboard career. His con-
cert tours have taken him
three times across the United
States and twice to Europe.

when Lipkin heard his first
concert at the age of three, lid
knew that he would become
a musician, and he started to
study both pinno and violin.
At the age of 10, after having
given semal highly acclaim-
ed public appearances as a.
pianist, he decided to con-
centrate on that instrument.
At 11 he entered the Curtis
Institute and for six years
(from 14 to 20) Studied with
Rudolf Scrkin, who has been
the chief inspiration of Lip-
kin‘s cam.

Lipkin also studied conduct-
ing at the Berkshire music cen-
ter under the late Dr. Koussevit—
sky who, a few weeks before
his death, invited the young
man to become a member of the
conducting faculty at the Berk-
shire music school, an opportun-
ity which Lipkin accepted.

During the war Lipkin travels
ed in Europe for the USO as
Jascha Heifelz’ accompanist
and during the season of 1947.
48 he was apprentice conductor
to George Szell and pianist for
the Cleveland Symphony orches-
tra.

Liplnn has appeared with 25
major symphony orchestras,
giving over 77 orchestral appear-
ances. The concert Tuesday
evening in Grinnell is a part of
his nationwide tour.

The Fund for the Advance»

sented Gl'illnell with a $16,-

mentation in more effective
utilization of faculty re—
sources Gl‘lllnell was one of
34 colleges and universities, out
of a group of nearly 550 insti»
tutions which applied, to receive
a grant.

in its experimental program
in l956-57 Grinnell will study
the effects of increasing indi-
vidual course credits in certain
departments from three to four
credit hours. The change will
place more emphasis upon di-
rected independent study and
creative work by junior and sell-
ior students, especially in writ-
ing.

Commenting on the experi—
mental granis program, Dr.
Clarence Faust, president of
The Fund for the Advance-
ment of Education, said, “The
problems of recruiting more
able people for college and
university teaching, providing
them with adequate prepara—
ﬁlm for their work, and util-
izing their competence more
effectively, are the most chal-
lenging tines lacing higher ell—
ucatinn for the next 10 or 15
years.

“if we are to avoid a grave
decline in the quality of higher
education, new and imaginative
Ways must be found to organize
and deploy our possible teach-
ing resources so as to maintain
and. even improve the quality of
education for a much larger
number of students in Amer-
ican colleges and universities."

All sessions except the lunch-
son will be open to the public.

Spivak and his orchestra have
won the Downbeat poll in the
“sweet band” category. Spivak,
once known as one of the great
jazz trumpeters, now specializes

in soft, sweet music for danc-
ing.

He has toured with
bands of Paul Specht, Ben
Yollock and the Dorsey broth-
ers, in the latter band play-
ing alongside such musicians as
Glenn Miller and Bob Crosby.

On his own, he became the
highest paid free lance trumpet-
er in radio before he organized
his own band. Spivak’s first big
engagement was at the Glen
island Casino, jumping-off»place
for more than a dozen of the
nation’s top—flight bandleaders.
He was so successful that the
Casino, traditionally a summer
spot, brake precedent by keep-
ing the doors open for the win-
ter season to accomodatc
Spivak’s drawing power.

spivak came to the Hotel
Statlel‘ shortly thereafter, and
broke Glenn Miller’s and Jim-
my Dorsey's records there, then
did the same thing at the Hotel
Commodore, also in New York.
He has been a regular {all attrac—
tion at the Statlel' ever since.

Faculty Okays
Four-Hour Plan

The faculty has granted
seven departments authority
to experiment with four-hour
courses during the 1956-57
school year. Classes will meet
tlilee houls a week and be
given intense outside study.
Othel (lenaltments expl‘essed
interest in the program but have
insufficient ﬂexibility of staff
and curriculum. ,

New 4 Hour Courses

All C and D level courses in
the English and Art departments
will be Worth four units. Classes
in other departments under the
plan are economics C28; history
C2, C33. C41 and D10; political
science Cl, C26, C52 and C47;
philosophy C17 and C32; psy-
chology c3, C28, C32 and D3,

This change will not affect
present four- hour courses and
two- hour independent study pro-
jects However, part of the pro-
gram will study the probable ef-
fects of a more general pro—
gram on the C and. D levels

The extra hour of credit in
each course will involve inde—
pendent work by the students.

Problem solving, field stud-
ies, artistic achievement, lab-
oratory exercises, and semin-
ar activities are possible nus
in which departments may de-
velop programs.

The program will be under
the general direction of repre-
sentatives of the participating
departments. Any questions
should be directed to the indie
Vidual department.

,Four-Foli‘l Objectives

As stated in a report to the
Fund for the Advancement of
Education, the objectives of the
faculty are four-fold:

“A. Development of depart-
mental programs with increas-
ed emphasis on (1) creative
and independent work by stu-
dents, (2) writing proficiency
and (3) use of library sources.

“B. Reduction of the number
of courses taken by students,
thereby to reduce the fragmenta-
tion of the student’s academic
work and to promote thorough-
ness.

“C. Increased effectiveness in
the use of teaching resources and
enlarged professional opportun»
ity for teachers.

“D. Curriculum improve-
ment in terms of reduction in
the overlapping of courses,
Consolidation of departmental
course offerings and integra~
tion interdepartmentally of re-
lated aspects of course offer-
ings."

It was also mentioned that
departmental programs should
contribute positively, through
carefully planned assignments, to
improvement in the student’s
use of language, particularly
with a major emphasis on Writ-
ing skill.
