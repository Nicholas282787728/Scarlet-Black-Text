As the gloom grow, we had

when we tried to verbalize our-
ideas in talking to President
Bowen and in talking to 13007
ple who said "What's this all
aboutl", it seemed hopelessly
vague.

However, we did talk to Dr.
Bowen and to other faculty
members (who were gracious
about talking school during
their respitcs from it), and u
couple or us spent many ove-
nings runipling our hair and
biting our fingernails. asking
each other questions that

plan which is still in the lornla~

to tackle the problem as one
of counseling.

As the system now is set up,
freshmen scurry fromv cored
meal to informal party, from
house meeting briefings to 15-
minute sessions with their ad-
visers back to cc-rd integration-
al meals. Quite often the fresh
man doesn't know, what‘s re
quired; what's available or tor
what courses he's Dreuared. His
counselor can scarcely be ex-
pected to register him with com-
plete satisfaction. particularly
it the student has not thought
out his registration to some ex»
tent beforehand. Thus our iii—st
step was to alert freshmen in
‘house meetines to their respon-
sibilitv in planning their own
year's study. ‘
Some or the ’{aculty is in-
terested in this proiecl, and
is, I understand, thinking at"
the possibility iii the school's
hiring a professional and lull-
