Around the ' Conference,

By Phil, Helmet

Incongruous as it may seem,
Grinnell's biggest victory of
1950 came in defeat. I don’t
think anyone will ever forget
how the Pioneers,

within a swish of sending into
overtime what many Grinnellr
ians consider the greatest game
they have ever seen.

As i watched the game I won»
dered how many of us there
knew that alleAmerican candi—
date Ron Bontemps, without his
especially powerful contact len-
ses, is practically blind. His
eyes are so bad that, without his
glasses, the Buc ace can’t see
the basket from the free throw
line.

it is truly a tribute to Ron
himself and to modern science
that he was able to overcome
this handicap and to score his

6+h Game Dropped
By Pioneer Cagers

To Simpson Five

Grinnell dropped its sixth
game ot the season Friday night
oless to a Simpson five.

The Pioneers scored three
more field goals than the Red-
men but lost at the tree throw
line. Simpson hit 24 out of 27
for a torrid 88.9% while Grin-
neu was sinking only 13 out of
19 charity, tosses. The Scarlet
and Black failed to collect a
point until seven minutes of the
game had elapsed. Bigelovtfs to
points in the Last thirteen min.
.utes of the first half held the
Pioneer scoring together until
Dunlap warmed up and was
able to bucket 23 points during
the second half.

Bigelow’s untimely exit from
the game at the very end of the
third quarter because of person»
a1 fouls hurt the team consider-
ably. Even so he garnered 14
points for an excellent 54-6
shooting percentage, his best
mark of the season. Dunlop
with 35.8 shot percentage gath~
ered 27 to more than maintain
his per game average. Dutton
collected 11 and Freyder‘s.

Sirong’Sees US.
Europe in Conirasi’;
Reporis On Trip

A six month tour through
western Europe not only gave
Professor Earl D. Strong an in-
dication of how European peo—
ple were living, but also served
to bring out. his impressions of
this c‘ountry in contrast. Pro»
fessor Strong spoke at an all»
college convocation yesterday.

“Even without a war, a good
future for Europe seems a gen.
eration away. With a war, this
future seems almost unohlainr
able," stated Professor Strong.

He went on to say that he was
disappointed when he returned
to this country because “here, it
would seem that we should have
every reason for hope. But 1 ar-
rived to find a nation filled with
jittery nerves, worries, and a
fear for the future"

Mr. Strong, who has returned
to the Grinnell faculty as pro-
fesscr of economics, was intro-
duced by President Stevens In
a short message, Mr. Stevens
said that the best thing men stu-
den's could do is to work hard
and maintain a good standing
in college. Very possibly, Stev»
ens said, men would be allowed
to remain in college if they
were juniors in good standing

Profesesor Strong continued
with the fact that he was never
so proud of his country as
when he was away from it.
Summing up, the former dean
maintained that “our faults lie
in our lack of faith in ourselves,
our institutions, and our coun-
try." He warned that “You
must have faith and you must
cherish the hope which will
raise- you to the stars in per-
formance and achievement,”
