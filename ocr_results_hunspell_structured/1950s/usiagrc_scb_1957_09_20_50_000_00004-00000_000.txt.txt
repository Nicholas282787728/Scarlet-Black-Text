Haugh Reorganizes

Personnel, Policies
0f Physical l’lanl

Calvin J. IIallg‘h, recently
appointed director of the
physical plant, has reorga-
nized the staff and some of
the policies of his depart-
lncnt.

The stall is organized into two
groups, by the type of work the
employees do. Engineer Max
Jones has chaigc ot the crew
which works outside bulldlngs—
the groundsmen, watchmen, me—
chanics and laundrymen Genera
al iorcman Chit Thorp directs
the inside activities oi electri—
cians, carpenters, painters, plumb-
ers and custodians.

In non—residence hnlls the
maids and custodians work in
teams rather than as individ—
uals. Each residence hall is
cared for by a maid, who is
assisted by the two janitors
assigned to each campus.

Accompanying the reorganiza—
tion were changes in policies by
the department, Haugh said ser:
vice requests, usually in writing,
must all be channeled through
his office except in cases of
minor maintenance or emergen-
cy. on Sundays, holidays, and
Saturdays when the full staff is
not on hand, a foreman will be
on call at his home, rather than
in the heating plant, to handll
emergencies.

The student paint crew has
been abolished, and replaced
by two full- ime statt painters.
The previous “hour week

for the plant start has been low-
ered to a 44-hour week. At the
same time, the wage policy was
changed to a weekly rate retleet-
ing a 48-hour week. Watchmen,
who used to work seven days a
week, now have a day off,
