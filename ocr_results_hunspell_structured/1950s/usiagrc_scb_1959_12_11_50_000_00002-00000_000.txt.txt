Reform Will Come From Inside

There appeared, again, in last week’s issue of the Scar-
let and Black, comments upon the government of south
campus by both the special assistant editor and the column-
isti After three years of this sort of tripe, (for another
good example note Acid and Base of this week), it seemed
that the time had come for some discussion by the distnff
side (research has revealed to this writer that in the past
three years 75 per cent — 2. conservative ﬁgure — of all
criticism of student government on this campus has been
by men about women).

First of all, what right or qualification do men have to
criticize Women’s government? Is it perhaps their own
moral virtue and experience in government — a. Virtue and
.experience which permits not only an absence of law to
reign but what is worse, a complete disregard of the law
to exist? And despite Voltaire, or Stocking or whomever
else cares to propound the sentiment, society Without law
ceases to be society.

Essentially however, I do not care to argue the ques-
tion of which side of the campus has the better govern-
ment b not because it isn‘t well worth the time expended
but because it isn‘t the real heart of the matter. Let us
assume for the sake of this discussion that south campus
has the best example of a corrupt, bureauoratlc, despotic
tyranny ever devised by the hand of man (or in this case,
women), and that north campus has the most outstanding
example of enlightened, progressive government. Still, what
right would north campus have for Cl’lt' mm 7_ They do‘ not
participate in women’s government. It is designed strictly
by Women for women.

If there are deficiencies # and there most certainly
are — they can and will be rectified from inside, Outside
assistance is unneeded until asked for. The only possible
alternative to this argument is that when a wrong ’15 evi-
denl‘ it must be lighted, i.e., that we are our brother 5 (sis-
ter‘s) keeper. In which case . . . women arise! Turn in your
big sisters! In this, the only coed monastery in the world,
we can have big brothers to watch over us!
