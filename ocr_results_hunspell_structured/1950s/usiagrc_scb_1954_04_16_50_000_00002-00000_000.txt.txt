_First Things First

An unfortunate decision was made this week by the
committee which is preparing the new constitution pro-
posal for 1atification In accepting the unofficial suggestion
of the administration as the best method of latifying the
new student government plan, the committee has put the
calt before the horse

Undelstandably, the committee wants to demonstrate
some concrete progress toward making student government
a more effective part of campus life; and to accomplish
this has chosen to present what is now acceptable to the
administration—and supposedly, to the faculty also—be-
fore the end of this school year. The rest of the constitu-
tion will wait, to be negotiated next year.

But the more important part of the new constitution——
the transference of power and responsibility from student-
faculty committees to student govelnmentgwould be the
part which waits. And the move to an executive council is
Virtually meaningless without this transference of pouer,
for the executive council will p1obab1y assign responsibility
for management of south campus to the League Board, and
for north campus to the C of HP. The only real change
would be the elimination of the Student Council. The judi-
cial boards, if established, would be a step in the right
direction, bllt the1e is serious doubt as to their accepta-
bility to the administration now.

On the whole, a change of this sort is not valuable.
And it is definitely not desirable when consideled along
with the fact that the1e is strong opposition within the
administration to the tiansfelence of power from student-
faculty committee to .student government.

Until the student body is assuredinot by» words or
promises, but by cooperative actionethat the administration
agrees that student affairsispecifically the social program,
student organizations, the semester fee, the social fee, the
student publications and the radio station—should be han-
dled by student government, then change is without mean-
mg.

Before‘submitting ‘any part of the constitution for
ratification, the constitution committee would do well to
find out if former Dean Fuller‘s report on student govern-
ment at the Far West colleges Was an expression of admin-
istration approval of such an operation, or whether it was
just an oration made to shift student attention from “ex-
benuating circumstances” to student government

Survey Shows Penalty Hours
Grades Noi- Definitely Related

by Jeanne Bannister and Charles Stegrneir

A recent S 6; B survey of the grades and cuts of those on the
Dean's list last semester showed no relation between the two. Now
a survey of 47 students who overcut last semester has been made
to see if the results are similar.

From the inlormation available .for this survey, it is not pos-
sible to draw any conclusions In order to determine whether
grades and class attendance are really related it would be neces-
sary to compare the students’ capabilities with their grades.

This study can only show that regular class attendance is not
absolutely essential for Satisfactory grade ‘

This story came from an
Arno’rc class: The instructor
was explaining the fine points
of lbhe possible cobalt bomb.
After saying that many scientists
believe that the C-bomb would
destroy all life on earth, he
finished with, “But it probably
won't be used except in extreme
cases."

‘A future ainman raised his
hand to ask what would be con-
sidered an extreme case when
the bell rang.

George Gallup cnmc out with
facts last week. He gave a na-
Hon-wide political quiz to
samplings of people 18 and
older. As ’he stated it, ”Results
show that, on the whole, the 18
to 20 ngc group does tar better
than their elders."

, The, highest zvcmgc score
was made by the 18 to 2:1
gmup and was significantly
better than um made by
ihnsc in second place. The 21-
to<29ers tied for third in the
field of ﬁve.

Joe l‘E-year-old has just when
courses in government, econom-
ics, history and has developed an
interest in _and basic under”
standing of politics and govern-
ment. Why let his sense of
democratic responsibility fade

that the more a given evil is

Senator McCarthy has stated
and: “McCarthyism will be the
issue in the fall Congressional
elections.” 1 believe that Grin-

sive citizens 'cf the United‘ States
should take up this challenge
issued by «he junior Senator

1 believe, also, that it is about

being concerned about the mime
‘dane, day—by—day living which
seems to have enveloped us in a
shell of selfrcomrplacency. 11 is
time that we became aware that
the world is much larger than
just the Grinneil Community,
and that this world is gripped
with more urgent issues than

An infonmed electorate is
essential to the democratic way

source materials for this lively
issue are Senator McCarthy's

The Editor

To the editor:

As a parent who thinks many
[an editor has abused dreedom of
the press and one who has not
always agreed with your own
editorial policy, I should like to
lanswcr Messrs. Johnson, Sampel,
Carpenter, McCauliff. and Bej—
grba‘s letter of April 9,

1 Because racial tolerance (and
lintoierance) is a world wide
lproblems and because you young
lmen and women of Grimell are

Could Stand a bit of embarrass
mam entailed by the publicity
of the rights your school stands

Rather than “notorie your
editorial was a renewal of faith
in Grinnell for me, especially
since along my longer road of
life rve met too many passive
people in the maiter of helping
