North Campus Stages Hell Night;
Preps To Be Hazed And Humbled

lly Staff Reporter
Tomorrow night is hell night for the preps of north
campus, Activities will begin sometime after Women’s hours
and end officially at 7 a.m. Sunday. Despite the fact that
three of the men’s halls have eliminated various aspects of November l4, I958
the prepping- program this year, all have planned a hell

night program.

Most of the halls will start
with a long housemeeting com—
plete with swats, interrogations
and various little games such as
“find your clothes under the
rug" to humble the as yet un-
humbled preps and amuse the as
yet unamused upperclassmen.

The halls have gone to a
good deal of trouble to make
this hell night a night that
will be remembered. Since it
is the custom for hell night
activities to come as a sur.
prise to the freshmen, the spe-
cific activities planned by
halls cannot be disclosed.

C of HP president Jim Jacob-
son has revealed certain plans,
omitting the names of .the spe-
cific halls. The day will see a
scavenger hunt, a Saturday
afternoon solicitation for World
University Service funds and
yard work at certain hall ad-
visers’ homes. One hall will as-
sign a prep to each upperclass-
man for the day.

In years past, the stillness of
Lake Acre and Rock Creek Lake
was broken several times dur-
ing the night, as preps Searche

. ed for hidden treasure or per.
formed other tasks. in other ac-
tivities, some looked for a
pound of cobwebs, a gallon of
used chewing gum or the signa—
ture of the chief of police. The
central campus trees have been
traditionally wrapped w i t h
string and the sidewalks adorn.
ed in chalk with the names of
the various halls.

This year's preps will enjoy
a hell night which will, as
disclosed by Jacobson, include
lemonade stands along high.
way 6 and an expedition to
polish the railroad tracks.
Some prep will be assigned a
night of study in the new li-
brary, while a lonely man on
central campus will ring a
hell and shout “311‘s well" at
three minute intervals through-
out the night.

The “constructive activities"
planned by some balls for hell
day will be few and far between
in the evening. After seven weeks
of constructive activities, hell
night is designed purely for the
hazing part of the program.
