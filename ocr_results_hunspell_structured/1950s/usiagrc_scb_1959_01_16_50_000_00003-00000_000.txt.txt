doped New York theatre

The “dwellers" in the cave ins
clude a former clown called
the “King" (Leigh Tracy), the

ed by David Durand and

A year and a half of design-
ing, building, and installing
transmitters brought KGRW
broadcasts to south campus last
Saturday. Chief engineer Dick
Scott id that he was not Com-
pletely satisfied with the sys—
tem as it now is operating, but
that further modification, espec-
ially of the unit serving Main
and Cleveland halls, will be mi—
nor and Will not interrupt re-
eeption.

The present system, accord-
ing to station manager Al Fitz,
is a legal combination of three
setups used in the past. ine—
vamping of the only physical
plant run solely by Grinnell
students was necessary be-
cause of technical difficulties
involving power level which
have existed tor four years.

Scott hopes the modification
and resulting improvement in

few people who like to prod"
