C of HP imposes
Fine For Drinking,

Disorderly Conduct

Sixteen quarts of beer and an
off-campus girl in a North
Younkcr room at 2 am. on a
recent weekend led the c of HP
to take action this week, The
senior in whose room the incl-
dent took place was ﬁned $10
for consumption of alcohol and
$25 for allowing disorderly Cunr
duct in his room. The council
recommended conduct probation
for the North Younker sopho-
more who admitted taking the
girl into the hall.

The C of HP issued three $15
suspended ﬁnes to Langan, RaWr
son and North Younker for their
participation in the water ﬁght

ior and a Cowles sophomore re-
ceived $5 and $10 drinking ﬁnes,

jectrcentered, seven the inte—
grated. The remainder find de-
sirable elements in either or in
a combination of the two ap-
proaches. Lasswell “It der
pends entirely on the course e
and the class. Generally, the
broader the course and the less
mature the Scholars. the more
one should lean toward secon—
dary research. The more special.
ized'the course and the more
mature the scholars, the more
one might profit by primary
research."
Stauss

— “I favor the ‘in-
tegrated’ 4-; course, except
that the ‘pnnjcctrcentered'
plan may be useful in semi.
nar—type courses for senior
majors in a department. 1 see
no objection to optional inde<
pendent term-projects for a
fourth hour; that is, an ope
tional fourth hour." ,.

Baranski also urges the elece
tive fourth hour, saying that
”students should be required to
do the independent work in
their major field only — if at
all. I would favor giving the
student the alternative of take
ing independent study or not.
In one group are students, go-
ing on to grad school ,who need
a broad background of funda-
mentals in many fields. in this
group also fall the students who
don't give a damn for indepen-
dent study.,Both of these types
of students ‘waste their time on
the independent study program.

“Then in the other grout:
there are students who want to
do independent work and who
profit immensely. by it This
group should be not only allow-
ed but encouraged in the pro-
gram. This element of choice
1 feel is the most important
factor in the independent study
program.”

Criticism of the program
came from Goodbrod, Gale
and Danforth. Goodbmd—“The
criticism is that the teachers
at Grinnell have been asking
too much for the fourth
hour." Gale — “Certainly if

the ‘4th hour“ is to be thought
of in the way you used the
term, as an appendage, we are
back to further ‘pieuermealing’
of education. Education should
come in reasonably-sized doses
selected or prescribed after
some sensible diagnosis; not in
small pills (either bitter or
sugar-coated) dished out more
or less at random."

Danforth 7 “I have never fav—
ored the fourth hour courses.
The study showed very slight
improvement in performance on
the basis of the fourth hour. 1
believe a course should have
sufficient content that extra
projects would be unnecessary.
At the same time, I am not
certain that three lectures per
week are necessary, Sometimes
study would be better for the
student. A student with a poor
high school background and
average intelligence would have
to spend as much as three hours'
study per hour in class to do
good work. At the same time
an intelligent student with a
good background may be got-
ting an A on one hour study
per hour of Class."

Wedncsday night a tradition
was established. Sandy Pearce,
the Quadrangle music chairman,
hcr committee (the hall music
chairmen), and ﬁve girls chosen
at random from each of the
halls serenaded north campus.
The serenade proved to be a
success and should, in my oplnr
ion, become a yearly event.

Tomorrow night three men’s
halls will he having house-
parties (see page one). Gates
