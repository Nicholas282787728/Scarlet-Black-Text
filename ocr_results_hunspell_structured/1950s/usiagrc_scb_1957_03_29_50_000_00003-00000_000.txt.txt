“There is a growing tendency
for growing tendencies." This
comment, casually dropped in
the dining room one night, set
us to thinking. How true it i

There is a growing tendency:
for the school year to seem
longer; for the chapel series to
be more interesting and varied
every semester; for students to
spend long hours playing Mans
“opoly and bridge; for papers,
projects and tests to the sched-
uled for the week just before
vacations. ,

Scouting around _we find
that there is also a growing
tendency: for freshmen to

seem older; for sophomores to
seem faded; for juniors to be

more Sophisticated; and for
seniors to be frightened and
teary at the same time at the
thought of graduation.

\ There is a growing tendency:
for more birds to make their
homes in the vines of Aim; for
Blair to look more alive; for the
ﬂoor in the Women's gym to

creak louder and more often;

for the Union to seem inade<
‘quate, for Mears to look its age;
for the Science building to seem
less new and out of place; for
the chapel to seem prettier; and
for the library to smell mustieri
The outside world, also, has
growing tendencies; for citizens
to be more interested in what
'their government is doing; for
Presidents to be more sports-
minded; for people to be more’
travel-conscious; for more peo-
ple to get better educations;
and for Hollywood to turn out
more long, long spectaculars.

Some growing tendencies
should be curbed or complete<
ly stopped, Growing tenden—
cies: for Elvis Presley to be
on everyone's lips; for people
to be more careless in their
driving; for children to grow
out of childhood sooner; and
for more young people to try
their hand at the business of -
crime.

These are only a few of the
growing tendencies on the rise
today. i'l'here are othe, both
public and personal, good and
bad, new and old, real and fic—
titious. Look aroiind you. They’re
there.

Will Chamberlain Enrolls Here;

‘The Still' To Play For Grinnell

Wilton (the Stilt) Chamberlain, America’s number one
basketball player, has just announced his decision to trans-
fer from Kansas University to Grinnell, Imnegotiations last
weekend with JohniA. Pfitsch, Grinnell athletic director.
Chamberlain decided to make the switch from a large
school to a smaller liberal arts college. ’

Pfitsch, who is an alumnus of

Kansas University,
Chambrlain's desire to get out
from under the big time pres—
sure last week, when he attend-
ed the NCAA ﬁnals in Kansas
City.

Chamberlain is reported to
have been unhappy at Kansas.
Hc felt that the school was too
large He turned down offers
from large eastern and Big 10
schools for the smaller campus
of a Big Seven schnol, But
Chamberlain has decided that a
school of 1,000 is better than
a school of 10,000,

wilt will come to Grinncll
sometime between now and June
to take a series of entrance ex-
aminations. The sevenvfoot all)»
lete has visited this campus only
once before and expressed a
desire to take his tests here so
that he “may have another
look." ‘

Definitely convinced that a
liberal education is more im-
portant to him than a basket-
ball career, Chamberlain has
chosen Grinnell because of it’s
"excellent scholastic reputation."

What will all this mean to
Grinnelllans’! In Pfitsch’s words:
”If we had Chamberlain on our

Quad's Hours
-Se+ Al" 3:30

It has recently been dis-
closed that, in a secret meet-
ing, the League Board de-
cided to extend women‘s
hours for tomorrow night
until 3:30 am,

The membcrs of the board,
after three hours of heated dis-
cussion, voted the extension as
a farewell gift from them to
the women before turning the
reins of government Overito
their successors. The move is in
accordance with the new board’s
policy of increased individual
freedom and, is hoped, will
pave the way to an honor sys-
tem under which the’ loggia
doors will remain open at all
hours.

Dean of omen Evelyn
Gardner has also enacted a
measure to increase the “hon-

,or" aspects of the evening.
She. has’ extended housemoth<
ers’ hours until 4:00 am. and
will entertain the ladies at n
Bowlndrome coke party.

“it is hoped that the girls will
make good use of this additional
time," says Anne Beuckman,
expressing a hope that the
move wil help to alleviate the
much~dlscussed Grinnell, social
situation. '

Only two sour holes have been

' sounded in the general harmony

about thc extension. One comes
from the “woman in white" and
the ﬁlittle man with the keys,"
who dislikes the prospect of

The other discordant element

having been consulted about

Gels Subsidy

For Expansion

The TV-Radio workshop of
the Ford foundation has vot»
ed to subsidize campus radio
station KGRW. The com-
munications branch of the
foundation voted a $100,000
grant for work on the sta-
tion.

Money has been allocated into
two specific iunds. The first
fund is , ”The Fund to Get
KGRW Heard and Worth Hear-
ing." Plans call for boosting the
station to mono watts to an-
able surrounding states to re-
ceive the voice of Grinnell col-
lege. .

Professional engineers will‘
also be hired. Alistaire Cook,
star of the Omnibus telev'h
siou show,’will spend three
mantlls’at Grinnell» to super-
vise auditions for announcing
positions. He will also teach
a workshop session for all an-
nouncers.

Television is
the second grant. The foundation
hopes to establish a television
station at Grinnell, so the en~
tire state can see just what
Grinnellians are doing in com-
munications work. This was
made possible ‘by abandoning
the foundation’s Omnibus tele-
vision show. Negotiations are
now being made with the FCC
to obtain a VHF channel.

KGRW has not decided if
they Will accept the foundation’s
proposal. Some mem ers of the
station feel that s bsidization
means control, and the station
will no longer be a station run
by, the students for the stu-
dents.

Officials of the administra-
tion are particularly happy_
about the proposed television
station. They are urging
KGRW to accept the founda-
tion’s otter. ,

A high college‘ official stated,
”Perhaps the campus television
station will stimulate viewer in-
terest in the Union. 1 don't thinls
couples are watching television
when they are in the Union‘s TV
room. This might be the per»
fect solution for the problem."

KGRW will announce its final

Relieves Hardships
In Stranded Train

About 225 persons were
rescued Monday after spend-
ing one and a half days
aboard a Rock Island line
luxury train stuck in 15 foot
snowdrifts somewhere in
Kansas One of those aboard
was Grinnell college's president,
Howard K. Bowen. l

The,train‘s plight was just
one result of the spring h1iz<
and that paralyzed the plains
states for three days this week
Actually, the storm, coming
from the west, hit numerous
cattle ranches and farms. On
one of these, a cow was pars-
lyzed on the' railroad tracks,

‘causing the snow to accumulate '

and stall the train that Bowen
was on.

En route from Chicago, 111.,
to Los Angeles, Call, with 'a
stoprover in Grinneli, the train
had’bcen marooned since mid-
night Saturday. lt was report—
ed that the morale of the pas-
sengers remained high, due
in part to Bowen‘s entertain-
ing the passengers, car by
car, with amusing anecdotes of .
the college.

it was noted that the heartier
laughs occured when he success-
fully succeeded in staging a one~
man show revolving around typ—
ical complaints of college stu-
dents ,(It was understood that
the take-offs on the loggia at
hours and the Sunday night
suppers were excellent)

The first five cars, including
the locomotive, were buried un-
der a 15 foot drift. Bowen,
along with several Rock Island
employees, succeeded in rescu-
ing the engineer and the fire~
man from the cab. The two were
reported in good condition,
their comment being, "Glad to
see you fellas, pull up a snow-
bank until we finish this job
, , . l'll raise you three . . '

Technical Problems
Preven’r Publishing;
Machines Collapse

it was announced today that
the paper will not be published
next Friday due to mechanical
difficulties at the print shop. The
trouble lies in the fact that
some major pieces of machinery
necessary for printing the ssrli
will not be usable on Friday
morning.

Lori DeLay, editor of the 5&3,
explained that the machinery
which makes the final correc—
tions and puts the pages togeth—
er on Friday morning will not
be available for use by the 5&3
next week due to technical dife
ficulties beyond her control. -

“I am certain that everything
will be back in shape by the

following Friday," Lori said,
”and the 5&B will he publish-
ed as usual."

When questioned as to the na-
ture of the difficulties and the
reason for the unavailability of
the machinery, the editor stated,
“The staﬁ‘will be on vacation,
tool"
