Well, here i go, Being the
editor 1 get the, job of writing
a column evcry week—Sume-
thing I've been looking forward
to.

I‘ve got a pretty big set or
shoes to ﬁll. however, in tak-
ing over for now. Watson's
weekly bit of athletic gossip
was well received, and though
his “journalistic nose for news
and trouble" had him dodging
coaches all year long and hid-
ing irom wrestlers or football
players on various occasions,
his column was successful.
Yin sure I’d be speaking for
most sports enthusiasts on came
pus in saying that I really en-
joyed what he had to say ev-
ery Friday.

Saiwe’ll have DC. back tor
a guest column now and then.
It's his last semester, you know
and many a senior in the home
stretch is hard
some work is involved.
we’ll see it we can haul him
out of "retirement" at times.

Anyway—it’s my turn now. I

think.‘ rather than/ jump right
into nailing someone to the
wall or talking of anybody or
any sport in particular, i’ll say
a word or two about the policy
of this department from here
on in.

In the ﬁrst place, i teel .

high school, Let me hear trom

For books are the basic tools

and nothing has ever re-
