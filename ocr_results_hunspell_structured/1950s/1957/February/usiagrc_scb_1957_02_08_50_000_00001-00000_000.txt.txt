and R. Bowen described present

plans tor the development of

tory conditions, and construct-
ing new buildings.

ariis will be increased grad-
ually.

Dr. Bowen emphasized that in
this period of expansion and
development student moperar
tion is necessary in maintain
ing the high reputation of the

per conduct of the student body
will do much to facilitate mak-
ing Grinnell a better college in
the future, he said
