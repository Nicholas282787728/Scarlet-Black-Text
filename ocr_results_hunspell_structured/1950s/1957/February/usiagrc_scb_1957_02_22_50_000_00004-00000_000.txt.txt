into a “little” man when he

Koch's position on the Grin-
nell team can be compared to
Jack, who gave the giant such a
hard time. The dark—hatred,

skinned senior is a

set of lightning rcilcxes and cat»
like agility, it is his attempt as
the club’s detensive leader to
bother the opposing ball—players
into making a fatal miscalcula-
tion at timing and end up boot-

work is seeing an exercise in
physical and practical psychol-
ogy. Glueing himself to an op-
posing ball—player like a
troublesome shadow. Koch
waves his hands and arms,
leaps and darts, ever intent
upon stealing the ball or caus-
ing his opponent to throw it
away.

Koch earned ten letters at
Keokuk high school playingr
football, basketball, tennis and
baseball. He gained his basket-
ball cxperience playing guard
on Keoknk teams that took

third and second place in the

Koch is not at all worried
labout the future of basketball’s
“little" men. “You’ve got to have
la fast, smart ball handler and
‘playsmakel‘ on a teamIYou don’t
need five tall men, in fact you
can’t get five tall men under the
lboards for rebounding, anyway,
and that is the advantage of be-
ing tall on a basketball court.”
Larry doesn’t consider himself
the fast, smart ball—handler,
play maker, but says that Laurie
Slocum (formerly of Carleton) is
a good example of what he has
in mind. “He was the best I‘ve
iplayed against. He could do any—
=thing He wasn’t flashy, but he
controlled the whole team and
quietly scored nearly twenty
points a game." '
