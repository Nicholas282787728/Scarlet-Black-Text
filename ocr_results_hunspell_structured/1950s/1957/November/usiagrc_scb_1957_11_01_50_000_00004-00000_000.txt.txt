From President Bowen

Commenting on Grillncll’s Convocation wcckclld, :l Des MOillL‘s
Register editorial writer said ll‘tis \Vccli, “Altogether. the three-day
Convocation was a brilliant occasion, and a memorable part of the
education of all who took part."

it can hardly improve upon that statement as an appraisal of
the weekend, but to it must be added the deep gratitude of the
trustees and of the administration to all whose planning and.ex€cue
tron made this a "brilliant occasion,”

We are deeply indebted to the program committee consisting of
both faculty members and students; to student groups such as the
choir and other musical organizations, the cast and crew of “Doc-
lor Faustus," and the football and cross country teams, the Men's
Honor ; to the food department which ably served the largest
event ever staged on campus; to the physical plant department
which achieved a logistic marvel in carrying out physical arrange-
rncnts; to the student guides, waiters, and waitresses; to the s or B
stafi which published a splendid special issue; to the Inlormatiun
'Service whose output oi programs and news releases was pro.
digious; to the Development and Alumni staff otiices which handled
endless details; to the iaculty wives who organized the housing and
to others who opened their homes graciously to guests; and, to the
many othersisludents and stafi alikeiwhose quiet but valuable aSv
sistance added to the pleasure oi our guests and the success oi the
events.

To all of them and to you i express a most sincere “thank you."

An Open Lctcr to
President Bowen

We wish to take this oppor—
(unity to (‘Xpruss our conviction
that the Convocation just passed
was the greatest event to come
to Grinncll college in its long
and distinguished history For
your part in making this under.
takrng possible, we wish to coll-
vey our appreciation.

The Convocation speakers and
their topics surely raise more
questions than they answer, and
the campus is lelt intellectually
disturbed. To use the apt phrase
or Dr. Wiener, horvcvcr, per-
haps we are at last asking thc
right questions, prerequisites to
obtaining right answers.

Pcrry Miller, one or our dis»
tinguished Convocation guests,
has spent a great part ol his
lite in study and writing on
the “hidden” or at lcast uir
known valucs oi the Puritan
tradition, values that seem to be
a great deal less cold and rigid
than we (largely as a result of
My. Mencken's statement) have
thought.

contest Mn Miller-ls views, and
it is not my inclination to
comment on Mr. Mencken's.

the heart to subject his ethics
to the unreccptive view of
our nlidecclltury culture.

play, “Inherit the Wind," Men~
