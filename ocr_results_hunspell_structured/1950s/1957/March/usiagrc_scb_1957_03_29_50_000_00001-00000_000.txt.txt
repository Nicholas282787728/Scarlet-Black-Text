For Use In Business Training

President Howard R. Bowen has announced a Ford

foundation grant of $28,000

for a new program to train

business leaders 'within the context of a liberal arts curric-
ulum. Appeal of the new program ,will «not be limited to
students planning to enter business careers,

The program will offer special
advisory assistance in helping
students plan a liberal course

to assist preparation in their
particular area of business in-
terest.

New Business Courses

Under the grant, Grinnell ex.
ports to establish four new
courses deaiing with a role of
business in modern American
lif contemporary industrial or-
ganization, the capital market,
decisionrmaking within large
organizations, and the business
enterprise in modern society.
strictly liberal arts in characa
ter, the new.courses will re-
place several more conventional
business and economics courses.

students in the new pro-
gram my major in any de-
partment of the college. it is
expected that many, but by
no means all, will major in
economics. Regardless of their
majors, however, they will he
provided with a special ad-
viser to help them relate their
studies to their career objec-
tives in business.

“Business is one of the cen-
tral institutions of our society,"
Bowen said, “and is as worthy
of study in a liberal arts col-
legc as the family, the state, or

other important institutions

which make up our society."
Less Specialization

Commenting on the function
of the independent liberal arts
college in training future busi-
nessmen, Bowen said. “Modern
business organizations are show
ing much less interest in naiu
rowly specialized undergrad<
uates whose preparation ﬁts
them to ﬁll only one or two
kinds of jobs.

Need Broad Background

“Through the study of science
,and mathematics, they will gain
understanding of the technologi-
cal basis of business,” he said.
“Through the study of psychol-
ogy and sociology, they will
achieve background for the
problems of human relations
confronted by every business-
man Through the study of
political science, they will gain
knowledge of the relationships
between business and govern-
ment. ,

"The study, of history and
economics will give them per-
spective on the long-term social
and economic trends‘ attccting
business and will equip them
to interpret current economic
developments influencing busir
ness. The study of English and
speech will help them to mas-
ter the art of communication 50
nccessary to every business.”

litical, economic and social ex—
pression," stated Charles Cleav—
er (English).

lle continued, “in any given

decade all these fields have

development. The normal curs
riculum doesn’t give the stu-
dent a chance to examine this
,interrelatedness."

terminal. education, However,

have gone into journalism, prer
law and library work where it
is useful to have knowledge of

erican studies seminars and
