an open date last week.

Lawrence has also been ham-
pered by injuries. Last week the
Vikings met Coe and lost 35-7.
Bill Volkman. the Lawrence
star fullback, was sidelined by
a rib injury after scoring all
the Lawrence points in that
game. Also on the doubtful list
is the Lawrence ace passer nick
Ramsey, a sophomore from
Grinnell, who is ’out with a
broken hand.

Coach erson feels that the
game will he a toss~upl He is
not basing his observation on
the Lawrence showing against
Coe. but against St, Olaf. ,The
Vikings were minus only Ram-
sey and held strongly favored
St. 01a: to a l9-13 victory.
“Pete" goes on to say that both
squads are the same sizeand
that the backs are about the
same speed, Another sensation
back from last season, Dave
Mulford, may be able to go for
the vikingsjtomorrow. Mulford
was also on the injured list

when they played the Kohawks.

“Pete" says, “II we want to
win this one we will have to
work real hard, ll. will not be
easy to beat this Lawrence
team. I feel that we are in
excellent ‘physical common as
a result of two hard weeks
of practice. We have improved
our defense and hnve Spent a
lot of time running. It’s not
the offense that has me wor-
ried; it's whether all the Work
on defense the Past two weeks
has done some good. The boys
are up tor the game and wont
to win it just as bad as 1“
the students Want us to.“

The probable starting lineup
will have Jerry Kurth at end,
Bruce Wilkerson and Gary Nol~
der as the tackles, Carcaptain

Chuck Adams and John Ors-
born at the guards, and Bob
Grindey at center. In the back-
field are Larry Dukes Dr Gary
Pattschull at fullback, John
Copeland or cascaptain Jack
Shaffer at tailback and Shaffer
or Tom Castles at Wingback.

ln Triangular

The crack of a pistol
breaks the stillness of Mer-
rill park and there is a sud-
den confusion of’ scarlet,
black, yellow, and gray uni-
forms, as a field of 20 run-
ners jostle for position in the
first stretch of a Cross—coun-
try course.

This was the scene at the be.
ginning of the triangular meet
between Iowa state Teachers,
Sir Olaf and Grinnell last Sat-
which ended
with a victory for a strong
ISTC team with the Pioneers
taking second place and St.
Olaf third Teachers, with their
Conway brothers finishing 1.2,
had too much overall strength
and took five of the first six
places, Captain John Weldon
placed third to lead the ‘Pio-
neers, Sachs finishing seventh,
Kisser ninth, Sonju llth and
Neevel lzth. Scored as a tri-
angular, Teachers had 13 points
to Grinnell-s so and.St. 0131’s
92. ,

Since 1510 is not in the
Midwest conference, these re-
sults mean that the Pioneers
have won their that confer-
encc dual meet: this should
serve as a strong boost for the
morale of the squad, on the
eve of What will piohably be
its toughest dual meet oi the
season—against Lawrence col-

.lege at Appleton, Wis, tomor-
TOW.

Ted Sutherland, a senior and
veteran cross country man, will
lead the strongest Lawrence
squad in recent years. Supper-ta ~
the senior Jim
Smith, another veteran, and a
trio of outstanding juniors,
Dave Berganini, John Ross, and.
Hon Simon. Three newcomers
from last year’s freshman squad
will provide extra depth, and
this Lawrence squad is expected
to be one of the strongest can»
tenders for the conference title
in Novemlber.

The Grinnell squad will be
deprived of one of its stal-
warts for this meet as student
parson Chuck Yoak will be
unable to compete in the meets
away from Grinnell due to

stiff workouts during this
last week have improved the
squad's overall condition, pare
ticularly that of Walt Neevel,
who had suffered a wrenched
knee earlier in the season,
Sachs, Risser and Sonju have
also lessened the gap'between
their and Welden’s performan-
ces, and Coach Simone is con—
fident that this meet will reveal
improved all»round perform-

. ances‘.

lM Pigskin Gaines
Begin New Season

By start Reporter

Grinnell's 1 9 5 7 intramural
football season rolled into full
swing yesterday with Cowles
beating Gates 7-0 and Langan
topping Northe—o.

Last year‘s champions from
Smith will feel the loss of
John Copeland, who has ad-
vanced lo the varsity ranks,
but they still have a fair
,share of the men who helped
them win the crown in ’56.

Cowles, as usual, will be one
or the tcams to beat. (They-won
the Kent trophy last year.) The
top contender for ﬁrst-
place honors is South, which
probably has the best end in
the league—Paul Kantzler.

North will miss Larry Koch

l and Dick Crow], but should ﬁeld

a good team.
