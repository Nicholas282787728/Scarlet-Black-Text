' Open Letter to Bob Lucas:

Now that your tinkerstoy has
been endowed with $1334.52 of
students’ money, we question
your ability to justify the
spending of more than one
third of the Student Council‘s
allocation from the semester
fees in the ivyscovered erector
set on Central Campus.

With the Student Council's
backing of your research in

elementary electronics, you also ,

have the opportunity for some
creative, artistic, and varied
programming. But it is our ob-
servation that this has never
occurred to you, and that
KGRW is merely an obviously
unsuccesful attempt to compete
with private radio stations (na-
tional and local), television,
phonographs, newspapers and
magazines. All of these other

media are readily available to

students of~Grinnell but a cam-

pus radio station has not been
so in at least two years.

A campus radio Station is
not expected to broadcast in
color, stereophonio sound, or
slick paper; but it is expected
to be of interest to the in-
telligent college student. We are
sick of polls and questionnaires
on ”Do You Like KGRW” or
“Would you listen to KGRW if
” If the programs are
worth listening to, the obvious
answer is yes. But if all the
good programs broadcast on
KGRW since the graduations of
Haynes, MacDonald, Steiner. et
a1 were repeated, they wouldn’t
occupy the time needed for a
coffee-break. With sugar.

Grinnell's student Council, re—
sponsible for the distribution
of student funds,
has been faced
with a thirteen»
hundred a dollar
question in the
form of an ap

station. They‘
have answered
it by granting
the funds to KGRW, but not
without the raising of some ob—
jections.

It seems obvious that the
student body is in favor or a
campus radio station. The ens
tertainment and eduontional
advantages of a well-organized
and ambitious campus station
me great. And opportunities
for development of such a
station are inﬁnite. Most of
the quality-developments will
require little money—they will
depend for the greater part

on the amount of work sta-

To the Editor:

With the Coming of Convo-
cation we think that something
should be done to the Soscalled
“Showplace” of the Campus-—
Younker lounge. In years past

tion personnel are willing to
put forth.

Most of our objections to the
present KGRW have to do dis
reotly with its management.
“Getting on the air" took too
long and cost too much, some
say. The studio, which looks
like a page from Good Houses

keeping, was lavishly decorated.

and furnished with an eye for
professional luxury.

No one seems to beliéve that

student leaders are suspi-
cious or KGRW management’s
letter - writing, phone - calling,
recording of conversations. And
in its name—calling, directed

at student Government, ii:

seems prone to kill (or at
least injure) the goose that is
laying the golden egg.

At any rate, KG is off to
some kind of a start, even
though it is in the tradition of
Cash McCall and Joe McCarthy.
They’ve gained their appropri-
ation, but not without incurring
some bad feelings and distrust
along the way.
