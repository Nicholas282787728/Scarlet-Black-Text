scene of T. s, Eliot’s "The Cocktail Party," which will have its last'

theater,

By James Stacey

“The Cocktail Party” performed by the Gl'innell Play~
ers, is finely and imaginatively handled. The first act: moves
rapidly, iS funny, and appears to involve the audience.

There are only two parts of the show that seem slow:

Grace in Assume James Read. Main New llial System

Post in California

Harry A. Grace (psychole
ogy), dean of men since 195-5,

has resigned to take another
position,

Grace, who plans to leave
Grinnell in mid—June and to
assume his new duties early in
July, will become assistant
dean of students at California
state Polytechnic college in
San Luis Obispo. Counseling
and testing will be the main
duties involved in the new p05.-
liun.

In an interview Crace
stated that Polytechnic, a voca-
tionally oriented college which
concentrates on specialization
in the ﬁrst; two years and
general and theoretical educa—
tion in the last two years of
its curriculum. encourages
student counseling services.

He will act as consultant to

and convincing Edward. Betty -

Brandt is delightful, and shows
an unusually consistent feeling
for her part.

The handling of Sir Henry by
Lynn Parsons is at first puzzling.
But as we learn more about Sir

Henry, his handling of the role

seems right.

Barbara Earries begins as a.
nervous Lavinia, but ends as
warmly believable. Caryl Wag»
ner gives a good performance
of a difficult role.

A somewhat hurried, but are

.fective performance is turned in

by Dean Canakes. Jones is gen- '

uinely funny at times, but has a
tendency to go flat.

The direction of the play is
sympathetic and effective.

Having “The Cocktail Party"
follow “The Flies” is an appro—
priate choice. The two plays
deal with similar problems. At
times they even use the words
and images.

Eliot and Sartre are both seek—
ing the essence of life. They
are both trying to place man in
society. Man in terms of hime
self,in terms of society, and in
terms of the essence.

Objection to being an object,
a thing, is the central dramatic
situation in “The Cocktail
Party."

Chamberlnyne's dramatic
struggle is to find his sub—
jectivity. The ' same struggle
that Orestes made in “The
Flies."

Sartre and Eliot are alike
only in presenting the problem.
They fall apart in resolving it,
about as far apart as they
could get.

Essence is defined by exist-
ence. A man builds his own es-
sence by the series of actions
hc commits. This is what Dress
tes discovers. One must go out
ward to his essence.

Essence must be found with-
in, says Eliot, Man must turn
away from the periphery of
the circle (action) toward the
core, the still point of the
circle, the essence, GOD.

Did the Chamberlaynes ever
get out of the wastelandf This
was the biggest question raised
at Wednesday’s coffee hour. For

~me they do succeed.

By the end of the play the

the faculty advising system and
carry on vocational, personality,
interest and aptitude testing in
addition to doing institutonally
related research.

During his two years at Grin-
nell, Grace has been a leader
in the mental health movement
in this area, including Marshall—
town, where a new clinic has
been established.

His wife has been a special
instructor in psychology this
year. Both hold his. degrees
from Ohio State university and
PhDJs from Columbia uni.
versity. Grace also has no
MA. from Columbia, and Mrs,
‘Grnce took lrcrs at Ohio State

Before coming to Grinnell,
Grace taught at Michigan state
university, the University of
lllinois, and Columbia. He has
authored numerous articles in
professional journals and given
frequent lectures at workshops
and forums. He is a member of
several professional and honpr~
ary societies.

Chamberlaynes do treat one
another as persons, and not as
objects. There is it normal
give and take in their attitude
and actions.

The play begins in the mean-
ingless chaos of a cocktail party.
Ends in a meaningful, orderly
cocktail party. “The Flies" be-
gen in oppressive orderliness,
and ended in meaningful chaos.

The theater season at Grinnell
has been thought provoking, and
very successful,
