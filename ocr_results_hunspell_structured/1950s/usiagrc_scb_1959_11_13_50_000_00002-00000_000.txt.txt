The petition, drawn up

concerning prepping, represents to date the most progres-

three years.

been proven. That: there is at

The final action, however,

least a. large minority of men
is demonstrated by the ntlm»
the petition,

which We hope will eliminate

all of hazing, should not: only be laid down by this year‘s
C of HP as a recommendation to the new C of HP but
should also be incorporated into the rules of the college
by the administration in order that We might; be rid, once

lady Chatterly'i lover" Raises

Que
‘ by John Benson

The coming of "Lady chatter-l
ly‘s Lover”_ to the strand Tues-l
day and Wednesday raises ques-
tions about the desirability of
movie censorship.

The position of any artist on
censorship is, or should be,
simple; no censorship of any
form at any .time. That an artist
.should be free to explore all
he can with his mind and be
free to use all modes of cxpres-t
sion open to him is vital if
there is to be anything that- is
to be called art. And no ,med-
ium will become an art or atr'
tract artists, unless there is
that freedom. The currently in-
creased freedom in Hollywood
is fortunately attracting more‘
direclors who consciously think
of themselves as artists.

Any censorship is undemo-
cratic because it limits Hee-
dm of speech, and the right
ofanavtist to express an diea.
A censorship board is the re-
striction of the praentation of
ideas by the private opinion
of a few politically appoint» ,
'ed individuals. Censorship is,
unconstitutional because it
provides for punishment bar
fore any crime has been corri- ,
mittedi

Censorship

cannot work be-
cause the censor can draw no
definite line between what
should be censored and what
should not. Scenes which, out
of context, may appear identical,
can have completely opposite
moral significances when view-
ed as a whole with the films
that they came from; in cases
the censoring of an honestly
handled scene may give a sug—
gestive coloring to the rest of
the picture not envisaged by the
director.

A censor cannot tell where to
stop; censorship of one thing
leads to another. Those most iii-
terested in censoring the films
are usually those who are pri-
marily concerned with regulatr

art form, rarely attend ‘them,
and have formed their opinions
from. movie advertising and a
liberil use of imagination.

‘The general trend of movie
censorship is to reduce all
movie fare to that which will
be innocuous for children.
Agirming that many films are
anode for mature adults by
mature adults, and that adult
are capable of watching what
children are not, this is pretty
hard on the adulk. if the
cinema is to fulfill its possi—
bilities as an art, it must be
recognized as a form of ex-
pression for mature minds.

Censorship is easily open to
many abuses. One obvious one
that has not been unknown in
this country is political ‘cen-
sorship, Scientific films by
qualified experts have‘ been
butchered with standards set
for entertainment films.

There has been so much con-
troversy and so many court
proceedings over “Lady chat—
Lerly’S Lover" that i couldn’t
begin to give a coherent picture
even if T had the space and
energy. Unfortunately the film
is probably not worth the con.
trovcrsy it has received.

Constant publicity about:
films threatening adult subjects
makes it difficult to judge
their true worth.

The iibo, of course, does
not show the scenes or use
the ivords which excited the
controversy over D. in Law—
rence’s book. In fact, I ani
surprised that the censor
boards found anything specific
to out from the film. The New
York censms objected to the
general theme that in some
cases adultry may be excus-
able, and it was the suppres-
sion of his thesis brought
forth in an artistic medium
that raised objection.

The film is not very inspired,
but on the Whole it is a fairly
tasteful transition of Lawrence’s
ideas to the screen with credit-

 

ing the lives of others, and

might endanger the people in

. eyesore—is therefore inc-om.
pntible with the library and
fine ‘arts building. It would
be contradictory to gOOil taste
to leave it here.

We are allowed to believe that
to construct the fine arts build-
ing we must have the space
Blair occupies. And finally, the
designers might be
that. Blair clutter: the grand
vista between the new builds
logs. The vista being essential
to the character of them, Blair
would break the grand Vista and

Now the administration feels
that it is wrong for the hall
to force freshmen to buy pud—
dles. Why then is it a right
and an accepted principle that
all freshmen are forced to pay
a sum of money—iii some
halls it is about four dollars—
to support a television set
which they may in fact de-
spisc?

, Blair need not endanger lives.
All that is required is that we
make it inaccessible. it would
,he much more reasonable to
itake half-way measures prevent-
l'ing total collapse (instead of
,renovation). ‘And it would cer-
;tainlv be a fraction of the cost
.of‘ demolition to preserve what
exists. That the building'would
have no use, l acquiesce. But
that it has no worth I dispute.
As a piece of architecture,
Blair itself is a very pleasant
combination of styles. That it
should thereﬁore in successful
is astounding in the light of
the really ugly combination of
which it is composed. As such,
it is a worthwhile Study. But
it is not an eyesore. Know-
lrig, as I do, that the two new
buildings are both very plain
and functional, I aim impress.

The contrasts are endless.
Blair is beautiful: the library
is not. The library is functional,
Blair is not. One could even
assert that the old Gothic and
the new functional show the
ascending zeal of Grinnell’s
,founders while contrasting with
contemporary
But the single point established
is merely that the three make
a tightly knit composition, That
which_ represents so many good‘
things and forms a unity should
not be accused of being in bad
taste._
That the three buildings will
be close together, 1 know; but
that they overlap space is false.
The markers delineating the
Vfine arts building do not come
near Blair. Perhaps Blair,
.would be 0“ center, We shouldl
‘save its destruction then. at'
,leasi: until the new building
lnears completion. At that time
we could see whether it would
be off center and whether the
proposed plaza between the
new buildings could not offset
theoefeet, When Blair is gone
it is too late to decide that it‘
‘would enhance central campus.
If, as I assert, Blair would
enhance the new buildings,
then the grand vlsfn of, the
architects would be merely an
alternative to its destruction.
We of Griiinell assert so
much about rediscovering andl
preserving the knowledge of our
predecessors that even though'

The administration is deeply in-
terested in the great moral is-
sues at Stake, I ask the ques
tion, “15 the student's mind to
be ﬁlled with hogwash or is it
not?” and I am laughed at [or
asking‘ such a “little” question.

When Mr. Murrow spoke'at
our convocation, he told us—
as he tells everyone—that the
American public is being fed
a diet of intellectually uar—,
cotic hogwasb. Didn’t anyone
with authority hear him:, no

would be inconsistent for us to
destroy the only prominent, ins
teresting building which repre
sents the traditions of the past.
(Surely no one would dare to
assert that -Goodnow, Steiner
hall, Herrick chapel, Carnegie
library, ARH, or the women's
gym meets all of those qualifi-
cations).

There are rumors of build- ;

log a student Union where
Blair now stands. It‘could be
built elsewhere. There is
probably a contract to demol-
ish Blair. It can be broken. I
have appealed only to the
readers sense of reason. 1 ask
that they look at Blair, then.—

See if you aren't moved. See
if this symbol of the past which
is so pleasing to the eye, indeed,
which makes this place look
much more like a college (una
