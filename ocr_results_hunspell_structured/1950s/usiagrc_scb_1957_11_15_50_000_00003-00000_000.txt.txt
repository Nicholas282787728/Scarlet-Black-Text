President Bob Mchmsey
read a letter from Merrill. 0.
Ludwig, administrative vice-
president, stating that the
bookstore is not run im- the
purpose of making a profit.
The letter acknowledged a
gross profit last year of $4,200,
but pointed out that implicit
costs, for heat, light, rent,
maintenance more than ac-
counted for this sum, leaving
an actual loss irom the year’s
opernlions.

Ludwig further indicated that
prices on drug store items are
determined by outside vendors,
and that they are competitive
