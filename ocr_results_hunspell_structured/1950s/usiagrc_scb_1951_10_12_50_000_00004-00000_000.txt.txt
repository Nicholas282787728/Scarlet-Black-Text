Salinger Emphasizes Need
To ‘Stop, Look and Think’

Using quotations from the
Communist Manifesto, the Bible,
and the Dialogues of Plato, Her-
man Salinger preached a "stop,

Vlook and think while there is
still time" theme in chapel yeSA
terday.

In a good follow—up of Dr.
George D. Kelsey’s Tuesday
night message on “Values,” Salv
inger used the “iron collared
Russian brand of workers" in
contrast with the American
white collared worker. “The
American is apt to be examining
his bridge hand when he ought
to he examining his life hand,"
he went on.

Though it may not seem in
these times that there is any
choice, since thegovernment has
already taken a stand, Salinger

feels that one Cannot relax, for‘

one decision only leads to many
more. Illustrating this ”national
pastime of coddling ourselves"
Salinger went on to speculate
that perhaps Americans may
come to understand the so»
called austerity of the British.

The intramural football cham—
pionship seems to he shaping up
into a race between newcomer
north Younker and veteran
Gates.

Gates. in their toughest battle
so far, began the defense of their
title in barely squelching by
Rawson see. Gates points came
about as the result of a safety
and a Harry West to Chuck
Mathus pass.

In Friday’s other contest, south
Younker dumped Langan sea on

Staying in high gear,

Wacki’s touchdown passes to Bud

the game for Younker.

Smith stayed right in the thick
of the intramural scramble by
topping Dibble 13—0. Smith
struck on successive passes by
Jim Allingham to Hartley Bond
and Jim Fellows.

In the worst massacre. the Gates
powerhouse smashed south
Younker 58-0. Gates struck hard
as they hit for nine touchdowns
and five extra tallies.

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

A personal anecdote presented
showed the difference in the two
national “persunalities” by the
differences in advertising tech»
iniques for toothpaste in the two
countries. Whereas in this coun-
try the delightful refreshing
taste is publicized, the British
advertising in the example
might run; “It. doesn't taste
good. but it does the trick.” Sale
linger feels that the philosophy
has definite possibilities.

The chapel service ended with
the singing of the hymn “Once
to Every Man and Nation" al
lWeIsi-i hymn which followed the!
line of reasoning Salinger used
in his lecture. Worship assistants.

Every football player has his
own reason for .playing the
sport. Wally Baehler, 5* d", 170»
pound back on this year's Pio-
neers, is no exception.

Waliy’s reason for liking this
rugged form of exercise is “be-
cause of the self satisfaction a
person can achieve in a com-
petitive sport against another in.
dividual or team.” He lh'mks one
gets more of this in football than
ny othei spurt.

A senior letteiman, Wally was
primarily a detensive back last
year, but this year he is filling
an offensive berth too This is
only his second year of varsity
competition. As a sophomore, he
was ineligible because he had
transferred from Drake univer-
sity that year.

When asked about his opinion
of tomorrow's Ripon game, Wal-
ly said, “We are capable of heat—

iing them if we play our best."

He was definitely pleased with
the spirit displayed by his team-
mates last Saturday. “Even
though we were 34 points he
hind with less than 2
