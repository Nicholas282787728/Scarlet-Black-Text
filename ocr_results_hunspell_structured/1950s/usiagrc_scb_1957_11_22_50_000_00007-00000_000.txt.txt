mark of 3-? 2 and elevated them to a three-way tie for fourth place in the Midwest cone

Pioneers extending from 1952

through 1956.

In breaking the St. Olaf jinx the Pioneers capitalized on their hosts’ mistakes
St. Olaf fumbled five times during the afternoon and lost the ball on f our of the fumbles.

in this drive was a rake qlll

with the running power of

20 yards on the play.
