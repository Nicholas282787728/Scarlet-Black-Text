in orientation classes, the
proper methods of how to study
are taught: you remember these
classes that interrupted your
breakfast at the Union, that
one at 9 on Monday. where
you read your mail. wrote lct-
ters back, and talked to your
alphabetical friends, This is the
one where you had to make a
daily schedule and spent hours
trying to fill in the spaces with
bigger and different words for
recreation and procrastination.

Supposedly, there are ten
aspects in studying: Hygiene
(this means get that coffee at
the Union); Note~taking (stop
slipping the stationery in be-
tween the notebook pages);
Assignments; Analyzing your
work (you must have done
something all semester);
Reading (at least try to hot--
row the text for the course);
Library (there are other
things besides the newspaper
ruck), Vocabulary; condemn-a»
tion (you bid spades, I’ll say

referred to as Cramming)

Erdman Presents
Concert Of Dance,
Afternoon Lesson

Jean Erdman, an exponent
of the American school of
modern creative dance, will
give a conceit here February
4, according to Mary Winn
Risser, president of Orchesis.
Final confirmation of the
date has not yet been re-
ceived, but Mary Winn ex-
pects it in the near future.

Orchesis, which is sponsoring
the concert, is also sponsoring
a master lesson which will
probably be held during the
afternoon of the same day.
This is a dance lesson in which
the teacher presents material
to students with or without ex—
perience, but does not make
corrections. Mary Winn said
that she thought dance students
would be most interested in
these but that art and drama
students might also like to
watch or take the lesson

The dance departments of
other college and universities
such as Iowa state college,
Slate University of Iowa, Iowu
state Teachers' college, Drake,
and Cornell will probably be
invited to attend both the les—
son and concert which Orche-
sis plans to hold in Darby gymi

The daughter of a Presbyter-
ian missionary, Miss Erdman
was born in Honolulu and grew
up in an environment of orien-
tal and Polynesian dancing. La-
ter, she started her formal
training at Sarah Lawrence col-
lege. Her dancing has been calla
ed a blend of “freedom and
subtility.”

The school of modern crea-
tive dancing was Started 'by
Isadora Duncan and developed
by Martha Graham with whose
troupe Miss Erdman performed
as a soloist for several years.
The movements are not as
stylized as the contemporary
dance of Europe, but rather
”free" and “natural.”

A critic for the Timw of
India said ﬁlial “. . l in order
to see this dancing in its cor—
rect perspective . l . it is nec-
essary to set it against the
background of contemporary
lilo in America"

Miss Erdman recently made a
world tour, performing in Tok-
yo, Bombay, Honolulu, New
Delhi, Madras and San Francis-
cc. She is now artist-in-l-esidence
at the University of Colorado
summer session where she has
been since 1949, and has been
a featured performer at the
Annual Arts festival at Colo-
rado.
