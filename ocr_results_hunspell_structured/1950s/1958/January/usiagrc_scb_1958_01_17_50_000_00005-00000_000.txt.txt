Mermen Win.
Sel' Records;
Knox Is Nex’r

The Grinnell mermen surged
through on a tremendous wave
of power to deteat both st.
01a: and Carleton 65-31, in a
record-breaking weekend at the
Pioneer pool.

‘Big One' Anticipated

This weekend the Pioneers
face Knox. The Siwashers are
the team that beat Grinnell out
of its rourth straight conierence
championship last year in the
last relay. The Siwashers are
backed by the conference’s best
allraround swimmer, Bob Proeb~
sting. They are also loaded
with» freestylers and should give
the Pioneers their toughest run
of the season. it they get by
Knox they could easily go
through an undefeated season.

The only real competition after
Knox will be in the iorm of

the Air Force academy of Den»
vet. Simone and the tankmen
have been looking forward to
the “big one" with Knox ever
since March 2, 1957. With ev-
eryone performing up to par,
Simone ﬁgures his “big red" to
' come out on top.

day, the Pioneers were too
keyed up for anyone to touch

Freshmen Cagers
Beat Coe, 58-55

E. Q Bocth’s freshman cage

team walked off with an excit- ,

ing 58-55 victory over coe last

\Wednesday to account for Win

number one for the Yearlings
in three starts.

Jim Lowry, a husky Chi-
cagoan, was scoring leader
for the Grinnellians with 13
points. He beamed up with
Jon Groteluschen, Henry Mc-
Cullough, Jim Simmons and
Joel Prescott to make Death’s
starting quinteL Simmons and
Lowry played together in
high school last year; the
former stood out as the eve-
ning’s most eﬁecﬁve rebound-
er.

Leading at the half by seven
points, the Yearlings were al-
most forced to watch their ad-
vantage dwindle away to de-
feat for the second straight
time. However, a nice shot
from under the basket, made
in the last few minutes by
Larry Gandal, kept an edge.
Simmons put the game on ice
with a successful tree—throw.

The fresh squad has one game
remaining on their '57-‘58 sched-
ule, that being agdlnst Cornell
at Mt. Vernon in February.
