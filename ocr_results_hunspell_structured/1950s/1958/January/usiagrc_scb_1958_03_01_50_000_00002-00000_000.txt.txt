SC Candidates Announce Platforms ,...

Gary Cooper

We are backing Gary Cooper
because we feel that he has es-
tablished a world-wide reputa-
tion for honesty and justice
which no other candidate can
measure up to. Mr, Cooper‘s
maturity, ability and leadership
need no description. He will
give Student Council the ioree
and dynamism which it has
lacked in recent years.

If Mr. Cooper is elected, as
i am conﬁdent he will be, it
will put Grinncil college on the
trout page ot every newspaper
in the land. By doing this, we
can be assured of putting the
library fund ovcr the top, and
will be able totbeat out Ober-
lin tor ﬁrst place in the next
Chicago Tribune Rankrthe-Coi»
ieges poll. Grinncll will beneﬁt

so much by his election, that
there is really no other candi—

date.‘

Betore the student Council
can have the eilective law—male
ing character granted it in its
constitution, it must hold the
interest and conﬁdence at the
student body. At the present
time I don't think that it p05-
sesses these attributes, To ac-
complish this I propose three
measures which i will cliect it

umn in the Scarlet and Black

The basis tor my candidacy
stems from a growing sense at
alarm over the tailure of stu»
dents to deal with the most im-
portant of' issues and ideas in
this tune ot changing academic
and admissions policies, propos
ed new buildings, and a more
co-ordinatcd social program.

The student Council is the
one oftic l agency tor the
representation oi student opin—
ion, but the council must also
take the responsibility ot cdu-
cating and leading. This is
done through the energy and
initiative oi the president,

Thompson

My campaign has centered
largely on increased attention
to the desires of -the student
body as well as greater student
participation in the Council ac-
tivities, 1 see new problems
arising with the new develop-
ment program which need more
adgguate analysis from the stu-
dent’s viewpoint. 'One of my
solutions to this is the creation
of committees under the Coun—
oil to analyze these problems and
present their ﬁndings to thetr
faculty counterparts.

I see a danger in our pres-
ent emphasis ongrades and
studies, and resulting dc—em—
phasis ot creative activities.
In this respectl have,through
my service on the Central
committee and student Coun—
cil tor the past two years,
voted support to individual
groups tostering creative ac-
tivities while not detracting
trom the importance ot stud»
ies. This has taken the term
at support to such things ase
student musicals ~and KGRW.

Other items in my platform
include (1) publication oi com»
mittee activities to keep the
students informed, (2) greater
utilization at our present coma
mittee system, (3) creation oi

previous council meeting and
explain the problems involv-
ed and the signiﬁcance oi the
action taken. in addition to
this, the column would indie
cute the topics which students
could expect to lienr discuss
ed at the following meeting,

Secondly, the Central come
mittee would on Tuesday pre-
pare an agenda ot things which
would be discussed at Wednes-
day’s meeting. Minicogi-aphcd
copies of it then would be post
cd on the hall bulletin boards.
to this way students could be
kept informed on the program

I tavor giving the publica—

Thirdly, I would keep the
business meetings ol the coulle
cil directed toward certain
goals. As each issue arose it
would be discussed thorough—
ly and some action would be
taken immediately rather than
permitting the meeting to do-
generate into a disorganized
bull session.

Exemplary or my attitude on
the approach ot the council is
the iollowing statement: The
council' has been concerned
with how prospective students
should be led around campus,
when its chiet concern should
be what kind ot prospective
sludcnts we are going to gel in
the ﬁrst place.

I am prepared to take tull
responsibility ot the job a
council president must do, I

I also ielt that I did have
a suitable substitute at the

By organizing the opinions and
decisions oi nearly 900 Grinnell
students, the council can become
a powcrtul bargaining power in
dealing with the administration
and faculty.

The role at the Student Coun-
cii should not be conﬁned to
that of “supporting” and “spon-

should be to provide a body ot
