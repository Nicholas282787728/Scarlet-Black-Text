Polls, Second Servings‘

Saga food service in addition
to operating the dining rooms,
will be in charge of catering
service and operation or the
Student Union grill. Among the
features of Saga cited by Pres~
ident Howard R .Bowen are the
following:

Menus based on popularity
polls of student iood preferences

Second servings available at
any meal, except on the char—
coal-broiled B~uunce steak which
is served at Saturday night
dinner.

A “family style" evening
meal. Food is brought to each
table in dishes and placed on
the table, rather than individual
preeﬁlled plates. This idea was
presented by President Bowen
to last night’s student council
meeting. However, he said that
Saga will serve the evening
meal either way, according to
student preference. The advan-
tage of the iamily style method,
he continued, is that waste is
minimized and the money saved
can be used for other improve—
ments. He concluded that this
would probably be tested, and
student opinion would determine
whether or not it would be used.

The decision to contract
with Saga, President Bowen
explained, represents merely
a change in management of the
food service. Other food ser»
vice personnel will continue in
their present positions.

Saga will assign a resident
food director and assistant di-
rector. They will work under the
supervision of the college, tail-
oring the services of the food
department according to the
standards of quality and service
established by the college.

- Saga managers will handle ap-
pointment and direction of wait-
ers with employment recor'mnen-
