North Central Evaluates Merits, Flaws of Grinne/I

Ill March, Gl'innell college
was inspected by a team
from the i‘ol'tll Central ac-
crediting ngency. Its report
has since been submitted to,
the faculty and administra-
tion‘gmrl this Week, has been
cleared for publication in the
Scarlet and Black.

Members of the team included
John F Stocklein, chairman,
University oi Minnesota: Rich-
ard J. Doncy, Northwestern un-
iversity; David w. Weiser,
Shuner college Dcan Blair
Stewart of Obeili college, the
supeivisor; and sister M Car
niillc, college of St. Teresa, the
commissioner. -

EMPHASIZE WEAKNESS

As the team began its weelo
long study, President l-ioward
_R. bowen suggested that. _as
‘accl‘editatlon was not the ques»
tiou invovcd, the report em—
phasize the college's weakness

The following condensation
oi the report excludes much
background mat l and cone
ceiitrales upon those areas felt
by the Scarlet and Blaclr staff
to be of interest to the student.

The statement of objectives
of Grinncli college, as listed
on page 3 of the Grinnell
,College Bulletin, appears to he
adequate for a college of this
type in terms‘ of what
the college docs to or with the
studcnt to attain some of the
objectives listed, thé listing is
not specific enough. i-lowevcr,'
_in terms of what courses the
students should take to
‘achieve the objectives ,listcd,
the relationship between the
goals listed and tho 'courses
required to fulﬁll the college's
basic requirements is so strong
that one may wonder which
was developed first, the list
oi objectives or the list of
courses."

"These studies are undoubt-
‘edly useful, but in general they
do not provide for systematic
evaluation of the extent .to
which the educational purposes
of the college are being rc-
alized."

4-3 EXPERIMENT

“In an attempt to stimulate
individual study, Grinncll col-
lege has been conducting an ex-
perimental program sometimes
referred to as the 4—3 program
. . . (2 tom nct effects have
been visible such as the increas-
ed use of the library, the sine
dcnt feeling that the assignment
loads a e much heavier, and the
realization by the iatulty ,that
their work loads have not been
lightened appreciably.

"standards for admissions
are high andem'e expected to
go 'higher . t . As a result,
student attrition is compara-
tively low for academic reu-
sons. 0n the other hand, some
consensus was found on the
part of both the faculty and
the students that the se‘lecv
tioii process was being npplierl'
to some of the wrong charac-
teristics of students.

"These were' suggestions, most—
ly by the students, that the pre-
occupation with admission of
highly intelligent students With
good potential may have re-
sulted in a less desirable pro-

and social character-

CAPABLE OF LEADERSHIP

“.The curriculum and instruc-
tional program appear to be
well. adapted to the goals of
the' institution insofar as these
provide an excellent

though it is questionable, that
they are adapted to,tl-iat spec-

alc, although probably the
greatest impact of this will
come when construction ac-

“Perhaps the only evidence
which did not contribute to a
picture of high inoralcs was the
faculty concern over the quality
of the student body and over
the quality oi work represented
by a specific grade The review-
ers do not regard these concerns

“Finally it must' be remarked
that the apparent high inoralc,
which seems to bear little rela-

does not on the other hand
seem to dc-ve from a sense of

on some campuses which show
high morale without any evi-

OFF—BALANCE

. Grinnell college is of-
fering a maximum of those fear
tures which are traditionally
considered the disidei-ata, of Ame
erican higher education. Vigor-
ous demands are made upon a
selected student body in physi»
cal surroundings which range
from adequate to excellent.
There is to a high degree an
absence of distraction from
study. , ﬂ
“In structure, student life at
Grim-tell is \\'ell»bnlnnced and
educationally meaningful. In
practice, however, neither the
balance nor the meaning of
the educational process appear
to be realized. student atten-
tion is oriented to a remark-

NO "JOY"

"The reviewers were pro-

prescience to detect whether

The students seem to feel

"IMAGE" MISSED

Finally it must be remarked
that the review team missed the
image or Grinneli cullcge as a
unique institution in discussion
w i t h students. Conversations
about Grinnell tended to be con-
versations about the pieces of
Grinn'ellu about traditions in
hall, about 'COul‘sCS, about'pl‘o
fessors; and In these pieces
there seemed to be little focus.
The pieces tended to be com~
pared with other schools, rather
than to be discussed in terms
ofa Grinnellian image. or justi~

priately Griniiclliau. Perhaps

A more generally held image of
Gi-innell as an institution that
is different is important and
desirable ways might contribute
to the intellectual clan, which
is the indospensible characteris-
tic of a truly great educational
institution.
