To the Editor:

Annually at this season, when
the air should be ﬁlled with
good September sounds _ the
thump of paddles, thc gurgle
of lnolassesithc pcace of my
office is disrupted by the cater-
wauling of spoilsport freshmen,
uppersclass dosgoodel's, and
bleeding hearts from among thc
faculty. Are these people wct
blankets, or do they forget that
“hazing” builds e h a r a c t c r.
strengthens will. and creates
ambition in young men ,and
women precisely wht-n they are
entering upon a
of their lives?

Let one put the case simply.
Grinuell freshmen have helm
sheltered. They need the
rough-and-tumhle of hazing to
bring out the best in them.
What I object to is not hazing
itself, but the slackness and
inefficiency into which it has
fallen because of the spread
of misguided sentimentality.

Any examination of history
amply demonstrates the close re-
lation between accomplishment
and physical handicaps The epi-
lepsy of Julius Caesar, the
dwarﬁshncss of Napoleon, Frank—
lin Roosevelt’s paralysis — such
difficulties drove the supposed
“victims" on to political and
military greatness. In the arts
the case is even more over-
whelming: the blindness of Ho-
mcr, the deafness of BeethovI-n,
Byron's club fooL—all of these
disabilities led to major achieve-
rnents. Shakespeare. who seems
to have been in comparatively
good health, is a freakish ex»
ception to what Somerset
Maugham calls “the clubfoot
theory of the origins of art." I
should be surprised, in fact, if
new research did not discover
that the Bard was troubled, like
Carlyle, with severe dyspepsia.

One hesitates to carry the
argument to its conclusion for
fear of being misunderstood,
But it seems to me that ii
“prepping" is to he of maxi-
mum good to the college, it
should be carefully and fear-
lessly administered by the sh]:
dent body—and without re-
tard to old-maid sentiments
arising from habit or blind
prejudice.

i would suggest something
along these lines: Have the
freshmen declare their maiors
Students with an affinity for
the plastic arts should then be
blinded. Music majors should be
dealt th in a more complex
manner: deafened if they seems
ed likely to compose, garrotted
if they intended to sing, crippled
in their hands if they showed
talent for instruments or con—
ducting. It needs little imagina-
tion to develop procedures ap-
propriate to the other major
fields of interest,

For those students who had
not yet decided on a major I
should suggest a serious gen—
eral beating calculated to
stimulate the whole man. The
resultant ambition and maturr
ity could be channeled by l
counselling at a later dates i

I cannot deal here with the'
Vast area opened to beneﬁcial
prepping by the well-known rev
latlon between mental distress‘
and genius. However, I must rerl
mark that even the Crudc plani
I have outlined will bring young
people together for wholesomcl
exercise, foster teamwork. and
give the prep-masters a sense
of “a job Well done” and
this is to leave wholly aside its“
obvious effects in building char-

ac ter,

By Jurly Morgan

Last Monday a Cyclone

hit our campus. It raced

through the Union, tore up and down the Quadrangle log‘gia,
and soul led through every nook and Danny on north came

pus, st

ing up dust as it went.

The Cyclone was, of course, the year—book — recording
the events and personalities of last year. Reactions varied.

The upperclassmen devoured it
anxiously while the freshmen
looked on with curiosity and the
editor fretted.

The obvious differences in this
Cyclone are the cover (inside
and out). the size, and the lay~
out. The padded cover with an
arresting and quite beautiful
color picture on the inside covers
is a new feature.

The book has been made
smaller in surface area; there-
fore the number of pages is
greater. The smaller page has
produced a curious result, In-
stead of pages crowded with
pictures, as one might expect,
there seem to be fewer pic-
tures and more diverting white
space. The pictures should
catch the eye, Reaction to the
smaller book seems to be, on
the whole. quite favorable. The
problem lies in the layout.

Most of the pages are static;
they have no movement. In
many cases this is caused by a
lack of a key picture to catch
the eye and direct it around the
page. The hodge-pcdge result is
difficult to take in without close
scrutiny on the part of the
reader, The abrupt change from
sparsely pictured pages to ones
over-crowded also made for
rather choppy reading.

The new informal pictures
of the faculty members,.when
they turned out. were quite
interesting and effective.
Much time. on the part of both
the yearbook staff and the
faculty, was spent on this sec.
tion. Retakes caused inconven-
ienccs, but the result was it
much livelier looking faculty.

The organizations and activis
ties were handled as well as is
possible with such a sprawling
subject Convocation. considered
to have been the highlight of the
year. seemed rather lost in that
shuffle of this section even
though it did have five pages
devoted to it.

The halls were treated in
much the usual manner except
for the addition of two pages

of informal pictures and individ-
ual pictures of the presidents.
Many of the
pages suffered from lack of pic-

tures and strange placement of

those available. The informal
individual shots of the hall pres~

idents were a welcome and dif-

ferent approach to the presen—

tation of the men’s and women’s

governing bodies.

The sports section seemed
completely set off from the
rest of the book. The out-out
pictures and action pictures
placed sideways made this sec-
tion different—good or bad ac-
cording to individual taste.,

The junior and senior class
pictures were presented in an
interesting, though not consist-
ent, manner. It was by far the

best organized and laid—out sec-‘

voices one day in 1948. Their idea: a four-voice group with a
fiveevoice sound, Today with such hits behind them as “Day
by Day”, "Julie is Her Name", and “Graduation Day”, plus
several albums, the Four Freshmen are among the to]: vocal

groups in the country.

Bob Flamgan, Ross Barbour
and Don Barbour from In 'ana
are members of the ori lnal
group. Ken Albers from New
Jersey joined the group in
1956.

In 1950, a disc jockey in
Dayton, Ohio, took Stan Ken—
ton to hear them, After one
audition the four were on their
way to Hollywood to record
for Capitol. Since then, they
have appeared in “Rich,
Young, and Pretty" and on
the "Ray Anthony" television
show. The group has been
acclaimed in concert appear-
ances throughout the country,
and in. 1956 was featured on
the Nat Cole-Ted Heath con-
cert tour.

In addition to their vocal tal-
ents, the boys furnish their
own accompaniment. Bob Flani-
gan, first voice. plays trombone

and bass; Don Barbour. second
voice, strums the guitar and
frequently solos. Drums and
trumpet are the specialties of
Ross Barbour, third voice of
the group, and bass vocalist Ken
Albcrs plays trumpet and mello—

The group has won the

past three years and has had

four years. .
