get them.

"Behind this advocacy, when

out that weakness."

"For a long time before the
depression, the free market had
not served the farmer well. And
during the Twenties there had
been constant and bitter com-

He evaluated the Iorces of
competition and individualism
in determination of present-

mentioned sonic paradoxical

Two things emerge from this
altered view. he said. “There is
obviously a sharp diderenoe be-

regular workaday service and
those which, in eﬁect, are used
as Sunday garb. Many oi the
latter beliots, it is clear, are not
