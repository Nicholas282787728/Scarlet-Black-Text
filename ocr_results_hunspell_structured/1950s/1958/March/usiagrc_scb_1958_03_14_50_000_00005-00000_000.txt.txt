teams Selected by the coaches
last week, With Carleton plac-
ing two men on the first
team and one on the second,
and COC and Knox contribut-
ing one player to each of the
teams. Voting was more
widely distributed than in the
past, with Al Pursell being
the only unanimous choice and
with a total of 24 players be-
ing named by the coaches.
No juniors made the first two
teams, whieh consisted of
eight seniors and three sopho-
mores.

only hnldovers from last year’s
five. McBride and Armacost

To l/‘WC After Eight Year Lapse

Beloit college. Beloit, Wis,
has been readmitted to the Mid-
west conlercnce after an eight—
year abscnce. in the spring of
1951 the Midwest conference
1951 the Midwest conference rep-
resentatlvcs voted to oust Beloit
from the conference in all sports
because they had initiated and
had been carrying out a sports
program that did not coincide
with the philosophy of athletics
that the conference wished to
follow.

Since that time the Beloit
teams have met the conference
standards and were therefore

readmitted to the league. Fora
team to be readmitted to the
conference it must have the
unanimous vote of n11 the
faculty representatives from l
the nine other colleges. Grin- l
llell’s faculty representative l
is James stauss (economics). l
The announcement that the
necessary unanimity harl vot-
ed in favor of Beloit‘s readmit-
tance was received by John
pliisch, men‘s physical educa<
ton, Wednesday from the con
ference secretary in Chicago).

schedule, so as it now stands
they will probably retain the
present eight game schedule
with each team playing all but
one of the other conference
teams each year. A conference
committee is working over the
problems of the basketball and
football schedules. No definite
conclusions have been made as
yet.

Bcloit will not compete for
conference titles in football or
basketball until the ’59-’60 season
when it will be a full—fledged
member of the league. Until
then it will compete for the
league titles in all the other
league sports.

It was" sad...

when that great ship went down and the
last thing to leave the sinking ship was

a bottle of Coca-Cola. That’s because all
hands stuck to Coke to the end. Now there‘s
popularity! That’s the kind of loyalty

the sparkling lift, the good taste of Coke
engenders. Man the lifeboats, have a Coke!
