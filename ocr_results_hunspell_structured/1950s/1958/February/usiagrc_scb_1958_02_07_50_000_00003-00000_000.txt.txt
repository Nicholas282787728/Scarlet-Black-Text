Open letter to the Class of 1992:

since I don't have much to do
anymore, i thought in take
this means oi tr ing to make
you young iolks- an-are of the
beauty of our campus since
you‘re new here you might not
realize that Grinnell is known
far and wide ior its many bcalh
tiiul trees They are all young
and vigorous and, with one ex—
ception [ht-y are all less than
30 yea olti. i know that l'or
a laot, ior I can remember back
to '57, or was it '58, when we
lost all the old ones. It was
known as the year oi the big
lumbeing opoiatlou.

it all started innocently
enough just a iew trees at iii-st,

 

 

Folks opt thinking that they
were ji.t clearing the dead
tiees, but the woodsmen kept
at it and belore they knew it
there wasn't a tree lelt on the
campus. it was too much ior
our botanist. l lhmlt his name
was Russell Anyway, he hangs
ed himseli in his little g i-

 

honse The oldest tree on cams
pus i in trout oi the oldest
bulldln’ It's that little ilower-
ing crab in ti-ont oi Old Good-
new, the same one you young
lads climbed during the ritual
ot initiation. They were going
tD cut that one down also but
someone pointed out that they
had just planted it so they let
It grew

The lumbermen were around
so long we even ottercd a short
course to increase their eiii—
cicncv. It seems that then' tries
kept toppling in the w ong
direction. Anyone interested
may look it up in one of those
lnlisty catalogs in my son's
oiiice. it was listed as B 63,
Materials and Methods oi For»
est . it was a 6-3-l-z course,
cariying 6 hours lor the lust
hall, 3 hours tor the second
hall, meeting 3 times a noek,.
during 2 class periods yes,
we did amazing things back in
those days.

Aiter all the timber was gone,
we found ourselves with quite
an erosion problem on our
hands. As i remember it, there
was a large hole in the center
oi campus, right where the
launching platform is now.
That's where they put Blair hall,
but you youngsters wouldn't
ltnow anything about that.

So appreciate our lovely trees
standing in their rows and
columns and pruned so neatly.
I’ve grown accustomed to them
now and iind them rather plea l
mg to the eye. but 1 still i .
member how stritiing the old
ones were, especially in winter.
They just grew. i suppose most
people back then thought theyl
were ugly, erowmg so close
together and \Inrpl'uncd as they
were. At. least they never said
much when, thev were cutting
them down. But i loved those
old trees.

To the Editor:

For many years now Grinnell
college has been a coediieatioir
a1 institution which has jokin;
ly Cl'lliclzcd the social behavior
ot the opposite members of the
coeducational group. Grinnell
women are termed ii gid or
slohby Gi-iniiell men nit term-
ed jot-lts or lde rule con-boys.

 

These tcl’lns arc Vague, yet ll‘lr
(“Cate a lack of Colnpalibllily

The. purpose oi this common
tnry on our social sL—up is
merely to get a personal grudge
down on paper I'm sure I
speak ior other women when i
say that l'in sick oi not dating
because oi unrealistic criticism
oi our sex Thereiorc I propose
that we do something about our
situation. Why should we sit
in our rooms ivithout dating
when it really isn’t our iatilt?

Perhaps we should appeal to
the men oi north campus. Per
haps we should continue to sit
here without going out, relying
on the chivalry at these “fine

gentlemen."

But‘ isn‘t that. what we're dam

anywhere? All it is doing is
proving that we are the wcale

Personally I'm tired of sitting
hole. The spring is coming and
I do ’t think we're so slobby
or lrlgid. We’ve still got two‘
months and we haven't got a
thing to lose. why not take the
big step and bring ‘about a true,
sogl‘cgntiun or the sexes? The’

we can drive “them" out ol1
