Letter Tells
New Students
Of SC Work

Student Council last night vot-
ed to send a letter to all incom-
ing students next year welcom-
ing them to Grinnell, explain-
ing Student Council to them,
and encouraging them to attend
SC meetings and participate in
student government.

Several proposals were made
by Council members in regard
to the type of information and
the form in which it should be
sent. .

when the idea was Orig-
inally conceived of Sending
information to new students,
it was felt that a booklet
could be mailed which fused
all campus pamphlets into one
publication, It was found that
this would be impossible {or
next year because of the time
element and other considera-
tions.

In light of these developments,
the Council decided that it
would be best to send out ins
formation pertaining only to
Student Council and its opera-
tion. Also encompassed in this
information would be a welcome
to the new student from the
Council.

Another problem that faced
the Council was the form in
which this information would be
sent. Some favored an illustrate
ed booklet much on the order
of the YWCA Buddies’ booklet,
Others wanted a printed, "perr
sonalized" letter on Student
Council stationery. Following a

‘ lengthy discussion. it was decide
cd that the letter would be
more appropriate and it was
approved.

In other action, SC presir
dent Gordie Hunt informed
the Council that when Spring
nay arrives, all studcnts will
be required to bring their ac—
tivity tickets with than These
must be presented and punch-
ed at the beginning of the
lunch line.

In answer to many requests.
the Council decided to look into
the ”Visiting hour policy” at the
inﬁrmal‘y. An effort will be
made to provide visiting hours.

Hunt also announced that
Dennis Johnston has been ap-
pointed to the StudentsFacultv
Relations committee. He will
replace John Condon.

A recommendation will be
sent to Saga Food Service that
breakfast aEain be served be»
ginninlz at 7 am. as has bash

the policy in the past.
