. . From Your Ivory Tower"

Last week saw a debate as to the Value of elementary
education, speech correction, physical education, etc. in tlle
liberal arts curriculum. Supen‘icially, the fervor of that
debate was centered in the value of individual courses Qn
a wider plane. however, we can see a much broader sig-
nificallce in the now-dead issue.

The real question is simply this: should Gl‘innell con-
tinue its dualistic curriculum, offering “practical" courses
side-by—side with classical subjects or should it attempt to
“purify" the curriculum and offer only the arts?

Within the strictest definition of the liberal alts, the
latter plan is the only consistent choice. Liberal arts lms
plies scholarship in its highest form and learning for the
love of learning. This is the definition that is apparently
being used as the criterion in determining Grinnell's aca-
demic future.

But, in the G"nnell definition of a liberally educated
person, certain additional phrases ring out: ”and who has
learned to understand the principles and methods of the
natural sciences alld the part he plays in modern society.”
“And who has learned to care for his own bodily health
and to take an intelligent interest ill the health of the come
munity in which he lives.” “And has a sympathetic under-
standing of the social problems of his time”,

Are we to have the interest and the knowledge without
.the means of applying them'.7 Are we to see the evils ill the
world around us and yet not have the means to collie down
out of our isolated ivory towers and aid in their correction '3
These are the questions asked by those who l\isl\ to retain
the “practical" courses in our culricululn, \i'ho lrish [0 have
a sound background in the humanities and sciences and
then to acquire the methods to enable them to act.

A couple of nights ago a
senior friend of mine was parks

tennis courts when the head
lights of a town kid’s car hove
into View. The cretinous little
punks shouted the usual obscen-
ities, bounced around in the
fields for a bit, and then pre-
pared to leave. Happily, (or
once, they did not get off quite
unscathed; my lriend lollowed

"Camino" Characters Caught
In Fragmen+ary Amalgamation

By Liane Ellison

I am not‘sure whether “Camino Real” represents a look
through c. miscroscopc at a bit of Scrooge’s undigested pudding, or
a look through a lclescope at a tortured cosmos. Nor am 1 sure that
whatever scope iiwns focused completely, The play seems to 'be a
crazed amalgamation of fragments (some of them brilliant), a kind

of an optical illusion in which Mr. Williams thinks hp apprehend:

The characters who enter

there they find a chaos of
cruelty, despair and delapida-

or Where they are going. They
fall to adapt themselves to their
positions in the passage of time,
living instead in paroxysms or
