By John Boyles

Last Friday and Saturday at
Lawsonia country club in Green
Lake, Wis. the Pioneer golf
team came through to win the
conference golf title by one
stroke. Carleton, with a score
oi 632, was only one stroke
behind the Pioneers' 631 as St.
Olaf finished third with 645.

Picked by many to iinish
behind Carleton and St, Olaf,
the linksters came through
with these individual Scores
to cop the title: Phil Nelson
(conference medalist by three
strokes) — 76 and 76 liar 152;
Dave DeLong. 79 and 80.!or
153; Denny Collis. 80 and 79
for 159 and Bud Hulse. 80
and 81 for 161,

At the end of 18 holes last
Friday the team was three
Strokes up on Carleton and nine
up on St. Olaf. At the end of
27 holes, Carleton had some up
to take the lead by six strokes
so that the team knew they
had u: come ﬂirough. Phil Nel-
son birdied the last hole and
then Denny Collis sank a 25-
foot putt over a hill to get a
birdie and end the meet.

Coach harry Crawiord had
this to say about the season
and the conference meet, “At
ﬁrst we suiiered irons inex-
perience hut aiter we dropped
our ﬁrst three matches we
came through in iine iorm. i
was well pleased with the
good job the boys did in the
oonierence meet and was reale
Iy proud oi them. I look ior
a good showing next year he-
causc the improvement shown
this year. Except ior Phil Nel-
son, the whole team will he
hock, so we should be tough
for next year."

Conference medalist and cap
tain oi the team Phil Nelson
had this to say about the team:
“John Mork, Dave Goss and
John Hoyer helped us this year
by giving us plenty of come.
tition. Much of our success can
be attributed to coach Craw<
tord because of his always be
ing willing to give advice."

In Midwesl Conference Mee+

In one of the most hotly con—
tested conierence track meets of
recent years, the Grinnell Squad
placed ﬁfth among nine teams.

Chuck Yoak was the only ﬁrst
place winner for the pioneers
as he won the two-mile run.
Fred Boughey was third in the
same event.

Al Fisher placed fourth in
the 4tl0-yd. dash and third in
the broad jump to collect
points ior Grinnell.

'John Walden, team captain,
got iourth in the mile run and
the also—yd. run. The Pioneel's‘
two sprint men, Vihert Mahari-
ger and Burdette Ahel, placed
ﬁfth in the ion-yd. dash and
fourth in the 220 respectively.

in the high jump, George Su-

sens and Bob MCJimsey tied for
third. The Grinnell mile relay
team took third to round out
the Pioneers scoring.

Grinnell could very easily
have placed higher in the
team totals. Due to a Satur-
day aiternoon thundershower,
two lanes oi the track at
Lawrence were either partial-
ly under water or very mud-
dy. Walt Necvel, who was ﬁg»
ured to place high in the 440,
had to run in one oi these
lnnes and iailed to place.

In the mile relay Carleton
edged out Cornell to win. This
gave the Carls the points they
needed to tie for third in the
team totals with Lawrence and
the Pioneers ended up ﬁfth, one

point behind.
