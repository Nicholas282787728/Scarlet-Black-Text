SCARLET AND BLACK

June 6, I958

 

To the students of 2058.

Everyone else seems to be writing letteis to you who
are to follow us into Grinnell. You are being- painted in our
minds as a sort ot' a master race, the end product of years
1I' perfection ot’ the educational process. Frankly, we doubt
that you will have achieved tlle epitome of academic elltleler
01‘. We doubt, ill fact, that you \1ill be much (lii'lei'cnt from

in spite 01 'e'llnements in the colleOe cur',iieulum you
probably 1111l still be finding that tests aild pape come all
too soon for you. You too will probably still suffer from
the prevalent student neurosis~“l want to do something
but 1 feel guilty 11 hen l dese1t my books.” And 1011 too,
-\en i1' r'oui atmosphele is controlled scientifically, will
nobably 11d that; spi 111 * spi 111W at Grinnel. The Student
L'llion or its equiinlent 1 11 still be yoin i'a1oiite haunt and,
yes, you’ll plobably pla an even more complex card game
than the nolrrpopular bridge.
Included ill the library cornerstone, in which this issue
1' the Scarlet and Black will be placed, should he a record-
'ng of “We Weal- Short Shorts“ and a copy of the latest
'Lalteaser (a campus hinnor magazine), to give you a feel,
111g of our generation. No, frivolity hasn’t; been the (lom‘

nant factor 01' our lives, hilt it has played‘its role ill keeping"

ls sane and in helping us become people in the fullest sense
of the word.

And each of us has 11 ished 11e could get our name into
th e coinelstone of tllis libialy. Not because it seems to be
an enteltaining' stuilt but because 11e long 1'01 a ce1ta1n im-
mortality.

Elsewhere in this chest, you’ll find pictorial records of
11 at we look like, the old-fashioned styles we wear, the
strange foods we eat, the thoughts that to us seem import-
ant. But: don’t let the sweeping abstractions fool you; be-
: eath the manifestations of our own age and geographical
ocale, we too are people. In the last analysis, it doesn’t
-eally matter what we did here. but merely that; we were
here and that, to us as to you, Grinnell became an integral
part 01' our way 01' life.

Bowen's Letter Put In Cornerstone

The following is, 111 part, the letter President Howard
It. Bowen will place in tlle cornerstone chest of the new
library.

T111 the l11csi<lcnt of Grinnell who“

I hope and 11 ust that the libia ' in which this lettei 15 de-
DOSILOCl Will Sene the collego for 75 to 100 years IvlsuallLe thele
to , that you “I” lead this lettei ilcai the mtdpolnt 01 the 2151.
century

The “riling of this letter is to me a novel experience. Though
the written \1 0rd has long been my stock in trade, I have never
before held the expectation that any words of mine would be
read a century home.

As I write this, my world is In travail (I) The SOVICL Union
and the UnItecl States ale engaged in a massive struggle. which
we call "the cold war” . (Z) The vestiges of nineteenth c0117
tury colonialism are being 'laken off 1 . (3) In the United
States and elsewhere, underprivileged races are struggling ior
acceptance and for economic and social equality.

. we are at the dawn of a new technological cm. Nuclear
power has already been used for weapons, but has not yet been
employed extensively for peaceful purposes. The first artificial
satellites have been launched and the first lung-range unmanned
missiles have been fired, but interplanetary communication and
travel is still in the future

_ The present unseemingly state of the world has tended to
heighten public interest in colleges of the liberal arts. A limit of
renaissance of liberal education scams (0 be in prospect It is due In
part to the desire of Americans to keep pace with rapid scientific
advancement in the Soviet Union. But it Is due also to increasing
concern for the somal studies and the humanities

My colleagues in the faculty and administration Iu'e mindful
that Grinnell college was handed over to our careﬁs one of the
most distinguished and most effective colleges in the United
States . . . Ive are endeavoring to maintain and advance its
standing Our objective is that Grinncll in the let century Will
be among the Very finest colleges in the entire \vm'ld. \lVe are
working {or this partly because of our pride in Grinnell but
mainly because We believe that the correlative advancement of
humane learning and of the sciences is the only way out of the
problems or our generation.

Across the century, the facultv and I extend gieetings to you
and youi faculty. We hope that the demolition of em libraiy will
make way (or gland lieu designs fol Giinnell college.

Yours SIncerely,

Howard E Bowen
President
