Preparations are now being
made for the 1M football sea-
son which will begin Monday.
As in the past, games will be
played on Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday and Friday with Weds
nesday left open for reschedulr
ing postponed games.

Gates was the winner of last
year’s round robin tournament
which was made necessary by
the Asian flu epidemic.
With no flu. problem in
sight this years schedule
should be completed without
too many problems

At this early date, South
Younker seems to be the team

to beat. Last year's Kent trophy
winner, Langan, also should be
ﬁelding a strong team. Due to
the loss of many key players
through graduation Gates
chances oi repeating are very
slim.

The other fall IM sport,
tennis, will get under way
shortly after the opening of
the football season The foot-
ball and tennis programs are
being coordinated by John
'rruesdale (mens physical eds
ucation) and his student aides,
Bill Murray and Bill McClin-
tock. i

l have only one comment be-

fore the beginning of the 1953-,
59 intramural activities and this}
is to he directed primarily to
the football players, although it
will apply- to many othersr
throughout the year.

The officials for all the 1M ‘
contests are students who are
sacriﬁcing a great deal of
their time simply tor the 1M
players‘ beneﬁt. It can be ex-
pected that many times these
ofﬁcials are not; going to be
experts at the Sport at which .
they are oniciating, and conse-
quently, there are likely to be
quite a few mistakes It would
be greatly appreciated if all
players who are involved in
one of these situations would
stop and think heiore saying
anything, and then realize that
nothing will be accomplished
by ”chewing out" an oliicial.
If all this type of thing can

be eliminated, the games will
move along much faster and
will also- be a lot more fun
for those participating.

he Grinnell cr—oss country
team opened its 1958 season here
last Friday defeating nonscon-
ference opponent Wartburg, 17-
28. Chuck Yoak, senior, led all
harriers and came in with top
honors in the three—mile stretch.
Juniors Louis Sachs and Art
Risser were next, ﬁnishing scar
and and third, respectively.

The Pioneers captured’ ﬁve
of the top six places in the
meet. Fourth place was the
highest that any runner irom
Wartburg could manage. This
could indicate that Grinnell’s
crossAc‘ountry unit may be as
strong as last year‘s team,
which ﬁnished third in the
Midwest Conlerence. Another
bright spot is the fact that, in
general, Grinnell's times res
semhlcd mid-season effort ra-
ther than an opening meet.

Coach lrv Simone indicated
that he was pleased with the
team’s progress thus far. He
