ersey says:
it seems that the topic pres-
ntly uppermost in the minds
f many Grinnellians is that or
unified student government.

01 the many plans and corin-
Ierplans ilying about, none
trikes at the heart oi the mat-
ter and yet provides the utmost
in simplicity and workability
while at the same time l'etainv
ing for the student his freedom
of choice and action.

As a result of considerable
thought on this matter, I have
come up with a definite and
positive program.

First, abolish all campus oil-
lees.

Second, Establish the Student
Conn l president as dictator.

Third, let everyone make his
_own rules

Just to mention a few of the
obvious advantages of this for-
ward program:

1. This achieves the most
complete uirit'oation possible.

2. There will be no fuss or
hother resulting from too illzmy
officeholders, too many Commit-
tee meetings, and the like.

3. The Buildings and Grounds
department will save money by
needing to install only one tele
phone.

I am in favor of such positive
action as aiding Grinnell's
building and modernization pr
gram . . . by beginning immedc

Throughout the campaign, I
have tried to emphasize the {act
that the student Council is the
students official organ when the.
student body as a whole is deal—
ing with the faculty and admin-
rnstratrori. This is the Council's
primary iuiiction.

in the past few years this
function has been reduced in ini-
portance. Thus. in my opinion,
the Council ho railed in ttllis
vital area.

In addition to this 1 hare pro-
posed what I consider necessary
changes in the realms of comv
nruiiication and social events.
These c gcs, combined with
racemphasls on the Student
Council as the place here the
students can take their pi‘obs‘
Ithis, will materially; niprovc

While I can't otter any one
pcrience iii the actual mechan—
ics of student government at
Grinilell, I can say that in my
three years here i have not been
completely void of or indiiieru
Crrt toward dealings oi the Stu»
dent Council.

Because at the method or rcp-

ntauon, l have not been c

c to the an actual memiber.
However, this does not mean
that I haven’t been interested in
the actions of our representative
body,

My interest in the student
me‘dsuraiilec it elected, i would
employ this interest in the right
mariner, to better student gove
el'nlment. l oiier personal initia—
tive and interest in the student
body as my qualrrications tor
being your Student Council
president.

Membership on important lac»
uity committees makes the .stu7
dent Council president not just
a popular elected oiiicial, but

 

also the student body’s negohar

istration.

i feel that my orgmlizatiolldli
experience on extra-currioirlarl
activities, supplemented by a
great deal or experience ibeiorc,
entering Grinueil, has given nie‘
the albil ' to he an Effective
representative of the students
in the handling of their affilil‘s.‘

Having studied the Sltuati‘oli
here at Grinllcll at some length,
l have Come to the Conclusion
that there is no more ridiculous
institution than student govern-
ment.

The duty on" the administration

‘ls to administrate or govern Lhe

college. Despite all the high»
sounding phrases to the Ctmttral ,
the basic rules under which the
students at Giiiinell are govern-
ed, have always been, are and
will alwdys continue to be made
by the Board oi Trustees and the
administration.

low-ever. the administration
has abdicated its duty of admin-
islnating these rules which they
make and iras tricked the stun
den, body into doing all its d ty
woi . Thus we have the miser»
iriiie situation of the Board of
Trustees making the drinking
rule and then telling the c of
HP and the League Board to en-
io ‘e it in other words, the ad~
ministration makes the laws, but
its responsibili—

ties any iurtncr.

We must stop this ludicrous
state oi af'i’du‘S, The ipulipose or
the students is to study. We must
return to these traditional val-
ues. We must force the admirk
isiratiou to doeopt its responsi—
bility and duty to administer the
college.
