Announce Program
For Year's S+udy
In French Schools

Approximately so grants are
available to American college
students for study or teaching in
France next year, announced the
institute of international Educa-
tion. «

Forty oi the grants are for
young Americans interested in
teaching conversational English
for one year in a French school.
The “assistants d’anglais," in
general, live at the lycees or
ecoles normales d'institeurs to,
which they are assigned, and
teach about 12 hours a week.

Since these schools are located ‘,
in all parts oi France, and some
assistants will be the only Am ,
ericans in the community, the
grants offer an unusual oppor-

foundation. Each scholarship pro
