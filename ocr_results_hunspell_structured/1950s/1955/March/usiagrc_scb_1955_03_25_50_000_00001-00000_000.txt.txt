FOR AN ANALYSIS
OF CURRENT RUSSIAN
POLITICS BY STEPHEN
SPERONIS (H ISTO RY)

by Marv Olsen,
Chuck Stegmeir,
and Al Sampson

“In order not to risk Sella
deception or wrong-int; others
and oneself, the same prin-
ciples of justice and equity
which are the honor of hu-
manity must be omitted to all
without discrimination — to
strangers as well as to friends,
to the yellow man as well as to
the white, to the small nations
as well as to the large." This
keynote of the Conference on
Southeast Asia, held at Grinnell
Wednesday and Thursday was
expressed by Tran Van Chuong,
the Ambassador of Viet Nam to
the U. S., in the final speech of
the gathering.

Sponsored by the Institute of
International Affairs, the cone
ference featured the Hon. Gang-
anvihari L. Mehta, Ambassador
of India to the U the Hon.
Paul T. Leuarib, minister pleni-
potentiary of Lhe Philippine Em-
bassy in Washington, DC;
James E, Bell, from the Office
of Philippine and Southeast
Asia Affairs of the U. S. State
Dept; and Van Chuong. The am-
bassadors discussed the vital
question of the future of South-
east Asia in terms of their re-
spective countries, while Mr.
Bell summarized U. S. policy on
this problem.

At the opening session of the
conference, Ambassador Mehta,
speaking on “India and the
U.S.", declared ”There is no
conflict of interest or ideology
between India and the Us. We
must strive together in the com-
mon task of maintaining peace."

He remarked that since her
independence India’s relations
with the U, 5. have been closer
than they ever were before, and
asked how this would be p054
sihle if there were as much an—
tagonism between the two coun—
tries as some say.

“In attempting to get a true
picture of Indo-American rela-
tions, we must take into account
three main points," he said,
“First, we are apt to emphasize
certain points, not taking into
account the total picture, to over-
simplify attitudes of other coun-
tries. and to exaggerate the
points about them we do not
like. Second, we confuse agree-
ment with understanding Be-
cause we do not agree, we think
we don't understand each other.
Third, we must seek to under-
stand the objectives, motives,
and background of the other
side, and should not judge Tela~
ticns between two countries on
their foreign policies."

One of the main explanations
for disagreement is the differ-
ence between the American
mind and the Indian mind,
Mehta explained. The American
mind is basically exploratory, in~
ventive, and action—seeking. it is
impatient toward disagreement
and slowness.

In contrast with this, the In-
dian mind is contemplative, tra—
ditional, and patient. Indians
think in terms of centuries, not
decades, and believe that time
will solve all problems, We can-
not control the forces of nature
or the social forces of other
nations.
