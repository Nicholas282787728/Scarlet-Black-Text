Discrimination Committee Meets tiers;
Presents Results From College Survey

crimination in Higher Education met here Saturday, Feb.
26. A report on recent regional and national meetings was

Resulis

The results of a survey on

dent organizations —- particularly

murals, and extra-curricular ac-
tivities, are almost entirely un-
segregated, and‘there is little
discrimination in admissions
policies. 'The Committee urged
the assistance of administrators
in Clearing up undemocratic
principles which still prevail and
in continuing to maintain demo-
cratic principles.

meeting, which was held in the
