the Board will be two fold, first
the general one of promoting en-

On Saturday, October 8, six
girls from Grinnell went to

in a Tennis Playday, None of
the girls won their games; but
since it was not any sort of

cared. Those who went were:

football game at Cedar Rapids

last Saturday, on three third
period touchdowns.

Grin-dell, which had a slight
edge in the first half of play,
took a 6—0 lead in the second
quarter on Jim Burkett's five-
yard off-tackle slant. The score
came after a 70-yard drive
which was spearheaded by the
running of Burkett, lLarry
Dukes, and Jack Michelletto.

Pioneer miscues led to threo

third quarter. Jerry Stonetberger
scored twice and Dick Jermier
once in the drive. ’

Frosh coach John Piitsch
pointed out that except for the
third period defensive lapse,
play of the yearlings was very
encouraging. l-le singled out
CoCaptain Gary Nolder, Bruce
Wilkerson, Paul Phillips, and
George Buffalo for their play.
The other Co-Captain, Steve

Ripon, on the other hand,

tomorrow, when the Pioneer

champion, Carleton college.

Since the series was start-
ed in 1892, Grinnell has won
10 and lost 15 in the 25
games played between the
’two schools. Carleton has
won seven of the last eight
contests, including a 16-6 win
during 1954.

Both schools will put two»

this Parents‘ day battle at

Northfield. The hosts are slight.

favorites to snap a twmgame
losing string and improve their
record, while Grinnell is
just as anxious to gain its third
successive victory after opening
the season with losses to St.
Olaf and Coe. both of whom are
still undefeated.

Third Place In View

A Pioneer win would put
Grinnell in a three~way tie for
third place in the conference
assuming that Cornell bows to
favored Cue this weekend.

The Carl offense, headed by
allsconference quarterback Bob
Scott and halfback Don V051
has been one 'of the finest in
the league and displayed fine
form against Cue last Saturday
until Scott lwlsked a knee mid-
way through the contest. Scott
will not be ready for the Grin-
nell game, however.

Carl Line Heavy

Scott‘s replacement will be
Dave Eifrig, who began prac-
tice this week, after having
been sidelined with a shoulder
injury. Eitrig has lettered at
quarterback for the past two
seasons. -

The Carleton line is strong
and heavy, and despite the loss
of and Dave Colburn, it should
present a formidable barrier
this weekend. ,

Walker, Holbrook Iniured

Coach Bob Peterson of Grin-
nell has been drlling his squad
extensively in preparation for
this contest, but minor’injuries
to halfback Sc‘otty Walker and
center Taylor Holhrook have
hampered progress to some ex-

Nevertheless, the Pioneers are
“up" for the game and tie

tests are meaningful.

High Scoring Bukfield

Halfbacks Scotty Walker and
Jack Shaffer, and fullbackSam
Petroff will carry the brunt of
Gl'innell‘s offense once again
this weekend. This trio has
scored 11 touchdowns in the
past two games and is largely
responsible for the 330syard
rushing average that Grinnell
compiled against Lawrence and
Ripon.
