Drake

The backers of George Drake
for Student Councll president
this week offered reasons for
giving him their support:

“Why do people seriously sup
port any candidate for the Stone
ent Council presidEncy7 simply
because they feel he
qualified to get done what needs
to he done in that job. We reel
this way about George Drake.
We back him because we know
him to be conscientious and
thorough in attacking a probe
lem; considerate of all sides or
that problem; tactful, yet hon-
est and direct in working with
students, faculty and administra-
tion. ~

”Moreover, we helieve that his
proposals lor student govern
ment, outlined in his platform
and elaborated during the past
week, present the most adapta—
hie student contribution to settl-
ing the uneasy Grinnell situa
tion, His proposals stress an
answer to the pressing need for
communication among all col-
lege motions.

”Drake realizes the necessity
for long—range planning. His
program promises no pink pills
or Utopia—realistic or otherwise.
Rather, he offers genuine inter—
est, consideration, and reason
ableness in his approach to the
diverse aims of students, faculty
and administration for the esta-‘o-
lishment of a healthier com—
munity government,"

Kassebaum

l-liaving known Ken Kasse-
oaum quite well for the last 3
years, 1 have been able to db-
serve in him a phenomenon quite
unique in human beings con-
nected with this campus. He has
consistently shown a brand of
enthusiasm for the student
Council that has more often
than not left him shouting alone
into that vacuum L student
apathy. Although humiliated by
a three year struggle with our
coke machine caliber of student
government, Ken has not only
maintained an interest in the
Student Council but bothers to
hurden himself with its respon-
sibilities, using a method of
realism never before considered
by Student Council presidents.
Why doesn’t he just junk a lost
cause? Obviously the fellow has
slipped a cog somewhere. But
I, for one, don't care to let him
standalone in his finest hid to
salvage that student organization
which has meant the most to
(him.

eration. I was. somewhat dise
heartened because we weren‘t
having a convention, and l was
ready to say the devil with it.
But since working with Ken 1
have had a chance to watch him
in action. I don't wish to sound
overly trite but i became more
and more impressed with his
industrious and sincere nature.
1 watched ‘him study the present
constitution and i watched him
create his platform. I liked his
approach. lt was forceful and in
telligent, Above all it was real~
istic. This realism which so
characterizes his stand has since
become a byeword in some areas.
His campaign is based on it. His
whole view centers around it.
Ken realizes the necessity at no
proving what we have as a
basis tor creating something
new, in short, the more i was
associated with him, the more
convinced I became that he had
the moat answers to the problem
ol ailing student government.

And doubtless the cynics will
also refuse to admit the fact
that the s, c, president is the
official and only active pesronal
