Drake Relates
Suggestions
For Council

Most of you have seen,
heard, or will hear my plat~
foun, so I won’t use this
space to explain it to you. I
would like rather to put
down my reasons for believ-
ing that we should not give
up the battle for stronger
student government at this
most crucial time.

It is very tempting to give up
making efforts for any big
changes in student government,
after having tried so often in
the past, and meeting with very
little success. This, I think is
why only two of us would stick
our necks out in this year’s stu-
dent council election.

I fully realize Ll’lai.‘ the new
student council president will
meet more difficulties than any—
one can possibly forsee. Realiz~
ing this, I feel that if 1 am that
new student council president I
will not. be easily frustrated by
the unforeseen obstacles that I
will undoubtedly meet.

These obstructions are the
dim part of the picture. There
are also bright spots.

1. l have talked with key
members of the administration
and faculty who are very ens
thusiastic about my plan for es-
tablishing a communications
council. They felt that this could
be the first step in bringing the
separate elements of the college

Grinnell College. Grinnell. lowa February ||l I95?)

lirveson Reviews Year's Activity;
Comments on Council's Action:

“This has been a quiet year.” This has become one of the
most well worn phrases on the Grinnell campus recently. In com-
parison to the headlines of last year it most certainly has_bee_n
a quiet year. Last spring student government staged a. quucotic
battle ior power. And as happens to people who fight with Wmdc
mills we were lifted high off the ground only to fall with a more
resounding thud. The shaking up gave us a much more realistic,
if perhaps a rather depressed outlook.

The work that has been done this year has been done
slowly with painstaking care and with lack of campus enthus-
iesm. I'd like to consider student government in general for a
moment. The c of HP and the League Board have worked
together to give us joint policies on all campus rules. The s. C.
has attempted to amend the constitution so that they may have
the power to allocate the proportion of the semester fee that goes
to student activities. The motion to approve this amendment lies
tabled. These were both aims which were embodied in the con.
stitution of last spring.

The three branches of student government have been work-
ing through 5. c. for representatives on the Personal Board when
all campus rules, situations, etc. are being discussed, and there is
a great deal of hope that this is about to succeed.

The s. C. attempted to form the joint council of faculty, stuv
dents, and administration that was in my platform last year, but
Acting President Hawk stated that he felt it was pointless be-
cause nothing could be done in the way of giving power to stu—
dent government until the new president took office

So most of our work has_been on small details—opening
ARH for evening study; sponsoring a foreign student scholarship,
sponsoring the student Musical (their were more roles than Stu»
dents trying out for them); sponsoring coed eating, which the
majority of the student body voted for and then failed to support;
sponsoring “Operation Lake Acre" which succeeded through the
hard work of Irv Simone and some student support; and the usual
duties of class elections.

in retrospect there are several observations I'd like to make.
First of all I‘d like to say quite honestly with no plea for sym-
pathy or anything of the sort that l feel I haven’t done the best
that I could, and l regret it. Secondly, lid like to say, and not in
justification, but as a matter of fact, that it is most difficult to
work our and with a student body which seems invested with
quietism. The poor president who wasn’t there gets the blame for
a quiet year, condemnation which I feel is most unfair.

The student body as a whole iust simply hasn’t seemed to
care — not even for recreation! Here at least we thought we
might get a rise out of them. Whether it is cynicism as a result
of last spring, lack of leadership from students in all phases of
student life, lack of initiative in all levels or simply the need for
rest, I’m not quite sure. I can only hope for those of you who

Kassebaum
Sets Fori'h
Views on SC

During this past week of
campaigning, I have attempta
ed to keep my ideas and at-
titudes about Grinnell stu-
dent government as realistic
as possible. In accordance
with this, I have presented
a platform which I believe is
at once realistic, practical,
progressive, efficient, and
adaptable.

It is my opinion, along with
many other people. that this ap—
proach has not received nearly
enough respectful consideration
in student council elections of
more recent yeals. Instead there
have been proposed a steady
stream of easy solutions to stu~
dent problems based on ideal-
istic and ineffective programs,
which have had a peculiar char»
acteristic of semblance.

They have also run a similar
short-lived course to extinction
when confronted by reality and
the facts. It is out of this un-
progressive and unproductive
rut, that I believe, with the en-
ergetic backing of the student
body, a program such as I am
advocating can pull our student
government. This is not to say
that it will solve all problems
dealing with student affairs, but
at 1 ast it is a constructive and

ve step in the right direc-

are coming back and for the college as a whole that you, the or

student body, and its leaders wake up, view life practically, and
accomplish Something next year. .

Student Council President

Aspiran’rs Lead Similar Lives;
Active in SC. Sports, Religion

George Drake and Ken Kassebaum, the two candidates
for Student Council president in Monday’s election, have
led Very similar lives from the start: Both were born in

' Kansas; one parent of each of the candidates is 2. Grinnell

community together’ in closer
cooperation,

2, They also favor the forma-
tion of a new student constitu-
tion under a well defined grant
of power. This grant of power
could most easily be worked out
in the proposed communications
council.

3. Perhaps the best reason for
not throwing up our hands in
despair now, is the fact that the
entire College is now in a state
of transition. The faculty has
taken advantage of this period
by reorganizing and strength-
ening their committee structure.
We too should take advantage
of this void Created by the de-
parture of one president and the
absence of a successor. We must
begin to organize now so that
we can greet the new president
With the beginnings of a well
organized plan for closer inte-
gration of the college commun-
ity, and more effective student
government.

What should these steps for
reorganization be? Roughly, I

minimum:

alumnus. Both were active in high school athletics and held
a leading senior class office. While in college, their records
have shown similar patterns. ’

Kassebaum

Ken Kassebaum, pre-med stu-
dent rrom El Dorado, Kansas,
has served for three years on
Student Council, including two
years of service on the Central
Committee and membership on
the committee for a new Con»
stitution.

Presently vice-president of
Langan hall, Kassebaum also
held the position of freshman
class president. Ken is a mem-
ber of the Board of Religion,
and president of the Methodist
youth group. He sings with the
Men’s Glee club and was initiat-
ed into Men’s Honor G this fall

for his activities on the tennis
court a the sport in which he
lettered. Out for basketball last
year, Ken declined to try for
the team this year. One reason
for this was the fear of injury
to his hand, which might keep
him from his chosen work, sur-
gery. in an interview Wednes
day night, Kassebaum stated
that he may “possibly" com-
bine seminary work with his
medicine and become a medical
missionary,

VOTE

Drake

George Drake, North Younker
pro-seminary student from La-
Grange, Illinois, was treasurer
of his freshman class, president
of his sophomore class, and ser-
ved on both the Student Council
and Central committee last
year. Assistant Informal chair-
man for the School last year,
George Cites positions on both
the sec]; sports staff and the
feature staff of the former
Arena magazine.

On Dean’s List all semesters
he has been here, Drake was
a member of Hermits, {rain-nan
honorary. He has been a mem»
ber of the Board of Religion the
last two years, and sings with
both the Men‘s Glee club and
college choir. Elected to Men‘s
Honor G for his activities on
both the track and cross country
teams. George holds the mn-
ference crown {or the mile run,
and several Course records in
cross Country. Drake plans to
go to seminary after gradua-
tion and hopes for a foreign
study scholarship, probably to
England. Setting sights on a
parish for himself, George would
like to combine this with teach—
ing a perhaps a Dean of chapel

position, he said.

I mentioned the “energetic
backing of the student body."
It takes considerably more than
an able leader and/or a good
structure to make a government
effective, The existence or lads
of responsible and willing con-
stituents determines Whether a
democratic government will be
successful or not.

i think that a lack of this
type of participation has been
the cause of much of our dis-
satisfaction in student aﬂairs.
Athletic teams cannot be sue
cessful without good players and
this same rule applies to our
student government

There is the common opinion
among the student body that a
new campus government set-up
is desirable. This demands elab—
orate changes which could not
be implemented all at once. As
good as the defeated proposed
constitution was, it was too
much different from our Stab
lished system, steeped in tradi-
tion, to be immediately appli-
cable. Thus we can see that for
such a change to be successfully
made, it must proceed by pur-
poseful steps following in a log-
ical order, It is with this ap-
proach that i would work with

Ken Kassebaum holds astrong
lead as the campaign for student
Council president nears an end,
an 5&8 survey taken yesterday
revealed.

0f the 240 students questioned.
1le hoped for Kassebaum's elecv
tion, with 67 for Drake and 31
undecided. Predictions of who
would win i-an much the same
way.

Again Kassebaum was favored
with 130 thinking he would win,
against 33 predicting Drake's
victory. 27 were uncertain of
who would come out on top.

Several upperclassmen confes-
ed complete apathy, expressing
no opinion.

Sludmole
Mon. on SC Prexy

Voting for the 1955 student
Council president will continue
from 3:45 a. m. to 4 p. m Mon—
day, to end a campaign marked
by few planned activities and
almost no excitement.

Added to the ballot that
students will receive Monday is
a referendum on Thanksgiving
vacation. The two questions that
students will be asked to answer
concern whether they want a
Thanksgiving vacation and if
they would leave Grinnell dur»
ing it. The referendum was
made necessary by the results
of the hall .polls which were in-
conclusive.

No campaign
scheduled for
Sunday.

The ignorant cynics are at

It is not a. mark of per-

mere consciousness to de-
clare that the Student Coun-
Cll has failed in many ways.

1. Such criticism ignores the
fact that s, c. has very limited
authority and responsibility in a
highly inflexible context, The
question is not—as the cynics
would have it—“Wlhat has s. c.
done?", but “What has 5. c,
doneiin tenms of what its
framework allows7" And it is
an altogether dirferent criticism
to say that s. C. can’t do any-
Thing. (This criticism is also in-
valid, but that is another argu-
ment.)
