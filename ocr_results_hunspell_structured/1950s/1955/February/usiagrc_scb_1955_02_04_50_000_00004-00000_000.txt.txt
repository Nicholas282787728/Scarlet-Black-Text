strength as this is the first year
they have had a full team. Grin—

the exception of Wally Bragdon,
who was graduated last week.
Joel Stubhs, Grinnell’s ace
sprinter will be attempting to
lower the current varsity

dual victories during the past
two Weeks. On Jan. 22 they
splashed past Cornell by a score
of 62-26 setting a new 400 yd.
freestyle relay record, and on

CIGARETYES

THEY‘RE CLAMORING FOR THEM! Who? Students. What? Luckies. Coast to
coast, dormitory to dormitory, college smokers prefer Luckies to all other
brands, according to the gTeatest uprto-datest college survey. Again, the
No. 1 reason for Luckies’ wide lead: Luckies taste better. They taste better,
ﬁrst of all, because Lucky Strike means fine tobacco. Then, that tobacco is
toasted to taste better. “It’s Toasie "—the famous Lucky Strike process~
tones up Luckies‘ mild, good-tasting tobacco to make it taste even better.
So enjoy the better-tasting cigarette . . 1 Lucky Strike. But don’t be like
the man in the Droodle above, titled: Pickpocket acquiring Luckies. Make
sure you have plenty of your own. Buy Luckies by the carton.

STUDENT/S! EAR" 525!

Lucky Droudles" are pouring in!
Where are yours? We pay $25 for all
we uae, and for many we don’t, use.
So send every original Droodle in your
noodle, with its descri tive title, to
Lucky Droodle, P. 0. or 57, New
York 46, N. Y.
