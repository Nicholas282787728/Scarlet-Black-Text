Salinger to Accepi
Teaching Position
On Duke Facul‘ly

Herman Salinger (modern
foreign languages) has re-
signed from the faculty to
accept a position at Duke
university, effective Septem-
ber 1.

Salinger came to Grinnell
eight years ago as associate pro-
fessor. Previously he had been
an assistant professor at the
University of Kansas City and,
prior to that, he was on the
language staff of the University
of Wisconsin.

After three years at Grinnell
College, he was promoted to
full professor in 1950; since that
time he has taught courses in
Comparative Literature in addis
tion to his work in German.
Last summer he was visiting
lecturer in comparative litera-
ture at the University of Wis-
consin Summer session.

Author of a hook of poems,
“Angel of Our Thirst," Dr.
Salinger has also edited “An
Index to the Poems of Rainer
Maria Rinse" and translated
“Germany: A Winter’s Tale"
from the German of Heinrich
Heine. An anthology of his
own translations was publish.
ed in 1952 by the Princeton
University Press under the

the social code much less re»
strictive. Young people have a
rather thin time of it here,
which is, l suppose, the reason
they leave lreland in such great
numbers for England, Canada,
and Australia. Then too, the
difficulty of establishing oneself
in any of the professions is so
great that the competitive
struggle starts at a much earlier
age than with us, and makes
much of school life sheer, dog.
ged grinding. A poor perfor-
mance in an examination at the
age of fourteen could easily ruin
one's whole Career.

in short, it’s been good to

be away; it will be good to be
back.

Yours sincerely,
