Find Trip Exciting Adventure

By Howie Needle

Even it you have only the wildest dreams of traveling
through Europe, by all means con ider them as a possi-
bllllty and project them into n realityinow! Last year at
this very time there were eleven students on this campus
who did not know that they Would be touring Europe dur—
ing the coming summer vacation. It was through the ill»
spiration, enthusiasm, and guidance of Pro' Thomas Lass-
_Wel‘. of the sociology department that this first organized
group of Grilinell students crossed the ocean on a tour

en

’Our tour was a great success.
'and this coming summer a simi-
lar Gr hell Tour, under the
leadership of Prof. and Ml
Jolin Burma, (sociology) will
ve lure ‘ i-th. The tentative
plans for t s iourney give every
incinatio. that it should be a
must worthwhile and enjoyable

the city thoroughly, made a
side trip through the English
countryside to Oxford, strat-

many art treasures. Following
the white sand of the Italian
