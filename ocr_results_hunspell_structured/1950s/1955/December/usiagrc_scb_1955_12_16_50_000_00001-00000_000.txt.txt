Pt. Bowen proposed a toast

to “The men of Gl'illnell and the women, who all wish they
were here tonight,” he was unaware that one of tlle women
had given up futile Wishing and had come to investigate last
Sunday’s stag Bum": Head Christmas dinner on her own. ,
I got into Cowles dining room safely, saw the cere«

chairman of the faculty, The
honored guests wore their scale
demic robes.

Mummer‘s Play

Aﬂer the final fanfare Father
Christmas, played by Dave
Steiner, came in and “Ye olde
English urnmer’s Play” bee
gan. A silent Knight, played
by Dave Quasi, bragged a bit,
and then was challenged by a
Turkish Knight, played by Er-lc
Tuattagaloa. st. George, played
by Jim Stewart, arrived aftter
,the Valiant Knight was killed
by the Turkish knight, fought
the Turkish Knight, and killed
him.

since the program said the
play ,was of st. George and
the dragon, I kept expecting
a. dragon to appear, but none
ever did. Steve MacDonald,
the Saracen Knight, was the
last and toughest of st.
George’s adversaries. Later , I
found out that the Saracen
Knight is the Dragon Knight,
but the logic oi this still esc
capes me.

After stevc Michaelides, play
ing the doctor, revived the dead
knights, the mu-ml'ners left and
there was another faniare. The
honor guard of Beefeater-s, dres-
sed like Yeomen of the Guard,
led the boar’s head procession
around the room. Four boys in
charscostumcs carried the boars
heed to its place of honor and
me Men’s Glee club followed,
singing the Boar's Head carol.

changed scarlct and black flags

collar, symbolizing the unity of
Grinnell.

A grace was said in Laltln and
the dinners were served. Presi-
