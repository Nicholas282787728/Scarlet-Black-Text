We're usually not very anxious to pay more money,
especially for something abollt which we sometimes gripe.
But we’ll have to ignore our selfish feelings, to support
President Bowen's announcement all of the Midwest coli-
ference schools, have found it necessary to raise tuition
costs recently. This “as probably inevitable, for we all
hear about general rises in cost for all sorts of things. Last
year even coke machines started demanding (limes instead
of nicliles.

 

The great cost of maintaining an institution such as
Grinnell has increased in proportion to increases elsewhere.
Mr, Bowen cites a hidden $675 scholarship for each stu-
dent enrolled. The college can only underwrite a certain
amount from its endowments and other gifts without
depleting its funds

Faculty members were granted salary increases this
summer, a necessary step iii maintaining the high level
of personnel for which Grinnell is noted. In his inaugural
address Mr. Bowen stated that this increase will not be
sufficient to meet the ensuing- competition for teachers.
This suggests further spending.

We are confident that the president and members of
the board of trustees have evaluated the situation
thoroughly and have arrived at the best solution, A few
weeks ago. a noted economist said, “ i . . the financing of
higher education will probably continue to be a difficult
and pe‘sistent problem. No college can ever afford to relax
its efforts to maintain financial soundness and orderly
development." The speaker was Dr. Howard Boil en at his
inauguration as Grinnell’s president.

Bill. Iools rush in etc and so
i will present n possihlc plan
ior an honor system in ihc hopes
ihni there are others who are
concerned enough to do some-
thing besides Sitting back in
their rooms and moaning.

There should be set up a
judicial honor court which
would iry cases of academic
dishonesty. n would be made
up cniirely of students but
would have faculty and mi»
ministration backing.

If u sludcnl sees that the per-
son next to him is cheating hc
Jr; the cheoier in turn himself
into the student court. If the
cheater refuses to do so
the student who has accused
him turns his (the chcaicr's)
name into the student court.

The student court then sum-
mons the accused student and
a trial i held atom-ding to
rules oi jurisprudence. This
court should he no star-
chamber but should hold uhc
il ' sell innocent until his
guilt has been proved.

take action.

The students' responsibility
does not end with this. The
person who permits nnoiher
student to copy his paper or

\ who writes a paper for Sume-

ouc else is equally guilty.
Students should rel‘usc any
such suggeslions.
