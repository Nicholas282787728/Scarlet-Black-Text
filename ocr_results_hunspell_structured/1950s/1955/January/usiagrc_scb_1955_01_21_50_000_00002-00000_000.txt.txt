How many times have you sat in a class room and
heard a professor confess confidentially, “I really don’t like
the idea of final exams." Many professors feel that one of
the features of the Utopian college would be the absence
of final examinations Why then, have them? The answer
is this: the academic as well as economic side of our soclety
has competition as one of its basic principles. It is neces-
ssal‘y to assign grades to students for the purpose of ap«
plying for graduate school, fellowships, scholarships, and
jobs. It is necessary to have a method of determlnlng the
relative standing of students; final examinations pronde
a common standard by which this can be done.

Since it looks like exams are here to stay, the only
course open is to make the best of them. Making the best
of a bad job is not simply enduring it, but rather search-
ing for the good features and capitalizing upon them The
good feature of a final exam system is that it forces the
student to review, and in so doing. '20 integrate and cor—
relate the various facts and theories that he has learned

‘ throughout the semester. This is the only way a course
becomes a meaningful unity. It cannot be done satisfac—
torily from Saturday noon to Monday morning for one
course, let alone five, and our professors would be the first
to say so. Yet review we are expected to do, and review
can only be done after the- last book is read and the last
Word is said. All too frequently it is the last lecture and
the last assignment which gives the key to the course.

In order to absorb the full value and total meaning
of courses, the examination period should be preceded by
a four to seven day “study" or “reading" period. Dur-
ing this time no classes should be scheduled, and the
student would have sufficient time to properly review
what he has learned, and in doing this, learn more.

This week the S&B made an informal telephone sur-
veyvto determine what the faculty thinks of such an idea.
Of the sixty faculty members concerned (ROTC and Physi-
cal Education staff members were excluded), 47 could be
reached for comment.

They were asked “Do you think that a four to seven
day study and review period, with no required class meet-

ings, held immediately prior to the examination period, ,

would prove valuable and desirable in terms of the inte-
gration and correlation of the semester's work?” 23 ans,
wered yes; 15 answered no; 5 did not care to comment;
and 4 considered it a toss up. Almost all who answered
yes qualified it by saying “if it could be accomplished in
view of budget and calendar problems", and ”if the stun
dents would take advantage of it."

We feel that the result of the survey is signifigant
in that one-third of the faculty members concerned find
something we don‘t have at Grinnell “valuable and desir--
able.” If it is desirable on a theoretical plane, it is certain-
ly worth investigating on a practical plane.

There are two ways in which such a plan could be
accomplished :

1. Professors could wrap up courses a week early
and substitute lectures which would review and unify i
the semester’s work. Students should have the choice of l
attending classes or studying independently. This solu-
tion would answer the budget-calendar problem, for l
neither would have to be altered to put such a plan into
effect. The same number of classes would be given, bllt l
the last week would have a different emphasis. I

2. Grinnell could be the bold and pioneering sponsor ‘
of the “study wee ” at the next meeting of the Midwest ,
Conference. I

It is conceivable that Grinnell is not the only schooll
which finds the calendar ruling of the Midwest Conferencel
a bit stifling, and if it stifles a valuable and desirable pro-‘
cesses of learning, it is time it be re-examined. We havel
learned all too well this year through the Thanksgiving“
vacation dispute that the Midwest Conference is a cow
more sacred than the administration. But we may safely
assume that one of the main purposes of the Conference is
to better as well as maintain the standards of the instituri
tions which compose its membership. l

The Sound 7

and
The Fury

by Art Travers

It is considered customary to
open one at these things with
a vibrant introductory para
graph. I don’t have one. This,
Of course, means that I am ViOA
lacing an old custom. Before
we’re through several other old
customs might be violated. Who
can tell?

Last Friday night the Wo-
men‘s Quadrangle presented
its annual dance intramural
for the members of Nﬂrlh
Campus, and it grieved me
deeply to see some of the
symbolism go over the heads
0f the audience. (It is not
pertinﬂlt to ask here whether
the world is ready for dance
intramural.) In View Of this I
should like to explain some of
the intricacies of the symbolic
dance.

To begin with each movement
tells an event; each dance tells
a story, usually tragic. (At least
what the Quad puts on is
tragic.) Ballet and modern are
particularly expressive. A typir
cal one might run like this.

Lights out. Suddenly the gym
floor is bathed in blue light.
The Vestal virgins enter; they
are wearing white formals, (All
borrowed.) They are barefoot.
Desdemcna, high priestess of
the Vestal virgins, follows them
in. She is dressed in pink. Her
costume is a little too small,
causing her to wear an expres~
sion which might be likened to
that of a man with creeping
BVD’s. She tries to hide this by
a look of rapture. She fails.

Desdemona is canying the
sacred urn. ’(The sacred' urn re-
scmbles an ash-tray from Main
lounge; in fact it is an ash-tray
from Main lounge.) This she
places on the floor, and spright-
ly dances away from it. In so
doing, she bumps into a vestal
virgin and to cover up the error
they dance “the dance to Zeus"
which wasn’t scheduled for five
minutes. At this point a figure
leaves the audience, which run
mor has to be Zeus. But this
IS never confirmed.

Now Dandelion, god oi
bootleg liquor, enters. He
wishes to set up a still which
will turn out Iowa 32. He is
supposed to dance “The Dance
of Sky Blue Waters" with
Desdemona, but hei' costume
has finally gotten the better
oi her and she has sneaked
ofi'.

Dandelion is somewhat at a
loss, but, alter a moment of in4
decision, resolves that the dance
must go on. He dances it solo.
He is doing a'SpaTtan's job but
just as he reaches his«climax,
the bulb in the spotlight burns
out By the time it Comes back
on. Dandelion has decided the
hell with it and has gone into
business making forged ID’sl and
Synthetic Maid-rites.

The Vestal Virgins now tippye

Nevelyn Requests

Payment of Fees

In Gym Tomorrow

All students must come to the
Women's gyin tomorrow ‘0 have
their fees assessed, and to either
pay or make arrangement for
payment, Norris Nevelyn, Comp
troller, announced.

The gym will be open from

8:15 a. m. to noon, and between
i and 4 p. m, Class cards will
be approved, activity and meal
tickets disbursed, and the‘fees
assessed.

Students who do not follow
this procedure will be penalized
by a 35. late registration fee,
said Nevelyn, Arrangements to
pay fees at a later date should
be made Saturday, it necessary.

toe around the sacred urn ever
so lightly. While they are do-
ing this, Aspic, god of the salad,
enters. He is smitten by the
lbeautiful Vestal virgin, Rox—
ane. (As she tippyrtoes by, one
of her arms, while waving
gracefully, clout: him across
the mouth.) He falls in ,love
with her and tries to seduce
her.

The seduction is accomplished
by “The Dance of Young Love."
(At this point, the person in
charge of the vic puts on the
wrong record, and the first
.half of the dance is done. to ”I
Wanna Say Hello" by Sophie
Tucker.) By this time the mis-
take is nuliced, everyone is ex-
hausted, including the audience,
Aspic and Roxane embrace and
go out followed by the vestal
virgins who forget the sacred
urn which remains on stage
throughout the next segment
which is an irregular Chorus
line doing “shuffling Off To
Buffalo."

So you see it takes a little
appreciation and understanding
to enjoy such a display. (Or a
morbid Curio .) A townsman
once asked me, when I laughed
at a Randolph Scott ﬂick,
"Wnatsa matter witchu? Aintr
cha got no soul?“ All I can say
is, “We do. Oh, my God, we no."
