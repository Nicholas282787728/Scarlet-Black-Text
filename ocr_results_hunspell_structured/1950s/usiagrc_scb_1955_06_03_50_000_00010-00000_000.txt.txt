The Student Council brought
its activity to a Close this year
by revising its constitution. The
revision, although it)made only
minor changes: in council struc
turc and procedure, did clarify'
the council’s present’ duties.

According to Ken Kassebaum,
Student Council president, it
"provided a basis for a more ei-
iicient and better deitned stud-
ent - government."

AS in past years the activiy
at no council has rungéd all

rejected alternative suggestions
for adding days at Christmas

lost by an extended vacation.
No Student Council collvenr
