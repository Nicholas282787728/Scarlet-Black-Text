At its Wednesday night meet~
ing. the Student Council claimed
that many prospective students
who visit Grinneli never apply
for admission. The council is
trying to ﬁnd out why.

A meeting is planned with
Rohert c. Sauers, director of
admissions, to examine the pres-
ent procedure in hopes of in-
creasing its effectiveness
The council declared the pres-
ent policy “inadequate," with
many of the student advisers not
knowing the needs of the stu-
dents, nor having time to do
the program justice.

he enthusiastic. Currently, only
3.8% find it to be so, while 60%
of the women students found the
attitude to be apathetic. Sever-
al women specified that the pro.
gram was met with enthusiasm
at its origination and then
“petered” out.

“Dress-Up" Days Replaced

In reference to the deletions
from the program, the early
poll indicated that 56% of the
women objected to the omission
of dress—up days. The League
Board replaced these in the pro~
gram for the duration of the
prepping season. Goody boxes,
also deleted from the program
found 60% of the women op—
posed to their renewal in both
studies.

The key question of Octoher
dealt with the new policies of
prepping the hall rather than
the individual. it was found
that 30% of the freshmen and
60% of the upperclasswoinen
then favored the policy change.
Currently. 56% of the fresh-
nicn approve, and only 30% of
the upperclass women

Seventy-six percent of the
freshmen and 55% of the upper—
classwomen in October felt that
the new program answered the
main goals of prepping. Sixtys
six percent of the women now
feel that it did not.

recent questionnaire include one

posed length of prepping pro-
grams. it is interesting to n te

(44%) a foureweek period, while
the freshmen gave a slight mare

advocates of the concentrated
program recommended that prep
caps and simple preppingbe con-
tinued for a month with special
activities being included in one
“Hell Week."

When asked \if they felt: that
a merit system similar to that
used on north campus this
year would be useable on
south campus in the future,
60% of the Women answered
negatively.
