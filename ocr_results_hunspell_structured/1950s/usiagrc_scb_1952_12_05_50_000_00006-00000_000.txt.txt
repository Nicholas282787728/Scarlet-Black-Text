A responsible consulting organization reports a study by a
competent medical specialist and staff on the effects of smoking
Chesterfields. For six months a group of men and women
smoked only Chesterfield—10 to 40 a day— their normal amount.
45 percent of the group have smoked Chesterfields from one (If
thirty years for an average of ten years each

At the beginning and end of the six-months, each smoker was
given a thorough examination including X-rays, and covering
the sinuses, nose, ears and~ throat. After these examinations,
the medical specialist stated . . .

“It is my opinion that the ears, nose, throat and acces-
sory organs of all participating subjects examined by me
were not adversely affected in the six-months period by
smoking the cigarettes provided." ,

Remember this report and buy Chesterfields . . . regular or
king-size.
