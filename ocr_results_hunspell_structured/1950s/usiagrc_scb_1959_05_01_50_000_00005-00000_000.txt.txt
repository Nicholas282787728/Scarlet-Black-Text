can say is this: It your hus-

Thinklish translation: This diner is

perched on a mountain peak, Which

makes it a crestaurant/ The View is tops

r—but from there on, things go downhill.

A typical meal includes a puny melon

(scantaloupe) and your choice of sand-

wiches (shamburgers or rank/urters). It’s

all served up, naturally, on 50—yl‘.-old

dishes (crac/tery). Best course to take:

light up at Lucky . i . enjoy the honest

your roommates.

I can almost hear the Fates
taste of ﬁne tobacco. There’s no tip
