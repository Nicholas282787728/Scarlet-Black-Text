Sociology Colloquim Takes Poll; :?
Explores IV Habils‘ in Grinnell

by Mary Olsen

Almost three-fourths of the families in

_nell own television sets. In this group, over 80 percent prefer
TV above all other media of entertainment. These and many
other interesting facts about television and its effects upon
the way people live are the result of it survey made last »
year by members of the sociology colloquium

In taking this survey, which
Covered all families in the City
limits, an approximate 7 vi per
cent sample was used. it was
composed oi so persons from 40
non-TV families and 409 persons
from 111 TV families.

Members of the bolloquium
who participated in the project
were Jane Walsh, Ted Souza,
Dick Wagner,-Carol Replogle,
Marrigoicl Kisslei‘, Mary Wetter-
holm, Beth Turner, Pat Prion,
Anna Kiess, Anne Eeukman,
Ruth Bailman, Eli San’dberg,
Barb Eckstein, Dave-Hagstrom,
'Tracy Spencer, Bonnie Young,
Nancy Koetke, and Bill Moores.
Dr. John Burma (sociology)
directed the survey.

In general, persons of the
upper and middle classes were
found more likely to have sets
than lower income; or retired
persons, with the retired group
being the only one in which
less than half had TV. Of those
with sets, over twoethirds said
they had purchased Tv for its
entertainment value; half the
remainder had bought it “for
the children.” That) children do
inﬂuence families'to huy tele-
vision sets was emphasized by
the fact that TV families aver-
‘aged 3.6:; persons, while nan-
Tv ones averaged only 2.2 per-
sons. The most common single
ruson given for not owning
sets was their high cost. . .

Books Suffered

The average amount of tele-
vision Watching was from two to
four hours a day, reported by
half the people, With a fo‘urth
watching less than this and a
fourth more often. Although non-
TV families go to the movies
more often than T'V owners, the
difference was not great. The
variation in radio listening was
not great either, since with the
exception of non-TV persons
over 30,‘ nobody listened to the
radio more than could be called
”occasionally.” The real Victim
of television turned out to be
books, for among adults, non-TV
families were found to read
about as per cent more books
than TV families. Hobbies also
apparently suffer, since a fourth
of the people said they engaged
in hobbies less now than before
getting TV.

in regard to preferred in
of entertainment, TV fam es,
as mentioned previously, over-
whelmingly endorsed TV, with
books and magazines accounting
for 15 per cent of the total pre-
ference and movies and radio
only 2 per cent. Almost half the
non-TV families rated the radio
as their preferred media, fol.
lowed by a third who selected
books, with the rest naming
magazines and movies.

Television also apparently
has quite an effect on Peo-
ple’s living habits, including
such things as evenings out,
visitors in the home, bedtimes
family harmony, and eating
habits. One of the hypotheses
of the study was that TV fami-
lies stay home much more than

non—TV families. This hypothe-
sis wlls borne out, but only
slightly, with non-TV families
going out just under one night
a month more than TV fami-
lies.
More Visitors

Another hypothesis that was
only slightly verified was that
people came in to watch TV, or
that TV families have more vis-
itors than non-TV ones. it was
shown that TV families aver-
aged receiving visitors on one
and oneella'lf occasions per month
more often than noneTV faini~
lies,_ although the striking vari»
ation was noticed that a large
majority of the families having
very few visitors also did not
have television.

a fourth usually turned it on,

Contrary to expectations, TV
viewers did not have later bed-
times than noneTV families. The
median for both . groups was
around 10:30; the nonJl‘V fame
ilies had‘ the higher proportion
of both early and late retirers
while TV ‘fanlilies showed a
greater concentration around the
median. Of the TV families, just
one half said they stayed up
later than before they had telee
vision; the remainder said it
made no difference in their bed-
time.

Family harmony and inter-
action are definitely increased
by' television, the survey
showed; only 10 per cent of
both Tv and non-TV families
felt that Tv decreases family
harmony, but TV families were
much more inclined to believe
that TV draws the family to.
gether. A majority of TV own<
ers also felt that it had “very
considerable educational effect,
as compared to just over one-
fourth of the non-TV families
who believed this.

Shows Harmful

‘ Both groups agreed, however,
that mystery and crime shows on
TV are “Very" or “slightly”
harmful to children, although
non—TV respondents were more
definite in their condemnation
than 'TV owners. The decision as
to which programs to watch was
made cooperatively in almost
two-thirds of the homes, by the
father or mother separately in a
fourth of them, and by the chil—
dren in the remaining 10 per
cent,

A third of the people inter-
viewed said they usually did
something beside watch while
TV is turned on, a little over a
third occasionally did, and a lit-
tle under a third rarely did. Eat-
ing is a particularly favorite
pasttime while watching televi—
sion; just over half the families
occasionally or usually ate in
viewing distance of TV and only
about a fourth never did.

At present only a basic or pri»
mary report of findings has been
determined from the survey, but
it is hoped to eventually make
many of the almost infinite
number of cross—references
which can yet be made from the
results.

VA Reports on GI
Earnings; Campus

Money earned outside of

under the Korean GI Bill has
no bearing on the amount of

These earnings need not even
be reported to VA, the agency
said.

VA explained that some vet-
erans still confuse the Korean
GI Bill with the original World
War 11 GI Bill which did have
an income “ceiling" that applied
to veterans taking all types of

and on~theefarm.

Although thcrc is no “ceil-
ing" for veterans \in school
under the Korean GI \Bill,
there is one for Korea veter-
ans taking on-the-job training,
