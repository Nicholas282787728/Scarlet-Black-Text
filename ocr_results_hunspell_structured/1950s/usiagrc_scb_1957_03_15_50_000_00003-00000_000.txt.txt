Student Council this week
recommended unanimously
that radio station KGRW be
granted representation on
the Board of Student Publi-
cations.

The recommendation was
made as one stop in a program
advocated by a student Council
subcommittee to insure long-
range planning for KGRW op-
erations and providc a measure
of continuity in its management

- not possible previously.

The board, to which KGRW
petitioned for membership this
week, in line with an earlier
‘council recommendation. sought
the further advisory opinion of
tlic council.

The board made it clear
that certain stipulations would
be attached to KGRW mom,—
liersliip, such as the presence
of a permanent engineering
consultant on the board, and
recognition oi the board's
right to review station polie
. cics.

Asked if these conditions were
satistactory to the station, its
new manager, Ecb Lucas, re—
plied “Emphatically, yes, We're

~very pleased with the way it‘s

going along.” Prior to this ac-
tion. the station had been vir—
tually independent tor forma-
tion and execution oi policy,
with Student Council appropri—
ating funds without stipulations.
The present action was taken in
the lace ot alleged inadequate
performance in the past.

In continuation of last week's
‘busiiiess, it was determined that
,thc total loss due to postpone-
,n-lent of the “Guys and Dolls”
production would be $20 tor
postage and phone charges, of
which about $7 will he paid by
the council.

The New York firm from
which scripts were originally
«exited is holding $240 of the
opera VVol-kshop’s funds on
promise of periormance next
year of the contract.

in view of this, Bob Mchme
scy, president, was directed to
determine the present status of
the workshap's treasury with
regard to tutiire undertakings
this year. if it is considered in-
adequate, the council will then
take up the question of whether
to make an immediate trans
fer of the $200 earmarked for
futur production ct “Guys and
