Students Charge Bad Faithi
Reject Constitutional '

Plan

The student Constitution committee this week ‘accused the administration of

acting in bad faith in its latest constitutional proposal,
plan, submitted at the faculty meeting Tuesday.
The new plan was in the form of a two page report

and unanimously

rejected its

listing in detail recommenda-

tions for changes in the original Constitution as proposed by the Constitution com—

mittee. It was in addition to the report previously given 0

ut that contained recommen-

dations of the Student Orgonization committee for changing the constitution.

Drawn up by President Stevens and Deans Norton,
Gardner, and Brown, the report was brought up before the
Student Organizations committee and passed with one dis-
senting vote. Members of the committee who voted for
it, are Dean Gardner, Howard Ellis, (music); Norris
Neveln, (controller) ; John Truesdaie, (physical education) ;
and Dottie Fulton, League Board president.

Kitten Arveson, Student Council President, was opposed to
the report. Joseph Danforth, (chemistry), and Dave Ferguson. C
of HF-president; were not present, and Dean Brown, as chairman
of the committee, did not vote.

At their meeting Tuesday, the report was submitted to the
faculy and Dean Brown moved that they adopt it. The faculty
then discussed the new report and heard Kitten make the £017
lowing basic objections:

First, that the substitute report which the student Organi-
zations committee approved contained absolutely no guarantee
that responsibility for student affails would be placed in student
bands and that the statement as to powers and duties wits so
vague and had so many reservations that the powers granted
were an unknown quantity. '

‘ it stated the powers and duties of the Executive Council in
this way, “The Executive Council shall adopt and enforce the
non-academic campus rules in those areas within its jurisdiction
In accordance with the general regulations of the College as
stated in the College catalog, and in cooperation with the faculty
and all administrative and operational departments of the Cole
.ege.”

Second, that the substitute provided for joint meetings of
the League Board_z.ud C of HP, who would “adopt and enforce
the rules pertaining to dormitory living for their respective
areas and fwould) make an annual report of these rules to
the Executive Council.” Kitten declared that such a. change

would not significiantly alter student government from the way
it is now.

Third, that this second report
included no provision for the
numerous committees that
would take on actual student
participation, »

Fourth, that provided no
guarantee that cases of any
specific type or for that matter
any cases at all would be delerl
gated to the judicial committees.
Kitten referred to the part of
the report which states “the‘
judicial com 'ttee shall sit as.
the board o; original jurisdic~
tion in all cases referred to
them . . _ . The Dean of War
men and Dean of Men shall
receive notice of all cases prior
to their ajudication.”

Fifth, that “all members of
judicial committees and other
persons present, including re-
porters, inust take an oath of
secrecy not to divulge any of
the proceedings unless offi:
many released by z tworthirds
vote of the judicial commita
tee.” Kitten stated that this

proceedings.

Speaking for the entire stu—l
dent committee, Kitten voiced.
unwavering opposition to the'
report on the above grounds.-
She emphasized that the report
was a complete abouteiace from
the position previously taken
by Dr. Stevens, former Dean
Fuller, and the Student Organi-
zations committee.

She declared that the wolk
of the student Constitution
Committee would seem to
have been done in vain and
that the attitudes expressed
in the report should have

beginning.
