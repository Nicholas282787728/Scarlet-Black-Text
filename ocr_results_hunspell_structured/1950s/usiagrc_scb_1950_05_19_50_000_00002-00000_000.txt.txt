Congratulations-Jn Order

A signi "cant award was made by Dr. Stevens ill convoA
:atioll yesterday. Stu Rocder, the energetic personality
wholn many Grinnellians know and all have heard about,
became the charter member of the Order of The Scarlet and
Black.

We have heard Dr. Stevens talk for sometime of estab-
lishing such an order. It has taken 104 years of Grinnellians,
some of undisputed distinction, to bring this about. It is our
sincere hope that the award will continue to fall only to
those persons who are not working toward it, but give u —
selfishly of themselves and with great initiative to the li e
of the college.

For Stu’s wide scope of service, his implanting in other
students tlle desire to create, for his attempts to “Put the
Grin back in G snell" we think he merits this honor. He
is leaving the imprint of action accomplished as well as
tllat of a unique personality on this campus. To him we
say Congratulations.

Confab Seeks Cooperation

A conference is now underway at Cornell. Its aim is
to create better solutions to our campus problems. At this
point we think it would not be amiss to create a little
awareness among the students at large as to what goes on
at such a conference and where your money goes that sends
these representatives traveling cross-country to attend.

They aren’t all play and no work. The conference meet-
ing at Cornell now includes Ripon, Cornell, Coe, Knox, Mon-
mouth, Lawrence, and Grinnell. Their aims in working to-
gether are to:

1. Exchange ideas.

2. Associate liberal

gether.

3. Effect certain specific services

benefit.

While these aims of the conference may sound some-
what vague, their work so f: ‘ has been strictly specific.
Projects on the agenda for this conference include setting
a standard 50c admission rate to athletic events for students
attending the competing school, room and board provisions
for visiting athletic teams, plans for investigating booking
and itenerary of big name bands, professor, chapel and cons
vocation speaker exchanges.

So far, there has been one previous meeting of the
Midwest Conference representatives. At that time they dis-
cussed common problems to the schools. One was on fie
nancing, another on the cause of student apathy and “hat
can alleviate it.

There was exchange of information concerning election
machinery, student faculty cooperation, power of the stu-
dent government, class attendance, and racial discriminar
tion. Grinnell brought up several topics including financing
of year-hooks and comparison of college drinking rules.

This is the beginning of a series of conferences that
show promise of being a real aid to student government in
the participating schools.

We hope the results of this and future conferences will
3e applied to the Grinnell college situation.

Machine Age--A Failure

What is a Coke machine without Coke? It’s a head with
out a brain, a cigarette without tobacco, a socket without a
rulb, Not only that, it's missing something.

We have one. Coke machine that’s missing something,
that is. Every day that blankety-blank mechanism outside
the south door of ARI—I says ”Have a Coke," and then smug-
gly wise cracks out of the other side of its

often and puts two bottles in it. He then promptly puts a
nickel in the machine and drinks one of the Cokes, “Just to
see if everything’s working okay."

At any rate, there’s got to be a change. Either thatl
red statue has to start producing, or it must give up the

space it's taking in front of an otherwise perfectly useful
doorway.

Letters To The Editor

To the editor of ihc 5&3; _ ,
We have read with much interest the lead editorial in last
week’s 55:3, and We particularly noticed one phrase: that there are

two political organizations on campus, to quate your words, ”two»

. most of the Way. But as
students interested in practical
politics we object to that phrase.

Students for Democratic Ac-

tion is not at all interested in
fostering the status quo. in fact,
there are those of us who do
not worship the status quo.
Even that other political organ-
ization you mention is dedicat-

if that is status quo, we’ll eat it.

Tell us, dear editor(s), is the
Brannon Plan “status quo’!” Is
compulsory health insurance

gist of the editorial. BUT . . .
we object to that phrase. Under-
