Goals For Integration

The issue of integrated women's halls (halls in which
freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors live together
in numbers whomewhat proportional to the total relation-
ship of the classes to each other) will be tested Monday by
a poll of opinion.

031 for integrated housing is well—round-

. Freshman enthusiasm in balance with

uppercless apathy and emphasis on studies is much more

desirable than either condition isolated from the other.

New ideas need to be balanced by general knowledge of how

things have been done before, rather than the limited know-

ledge of six uppercless women trying to advise forty fresh-
men

The result of well-rounded college living should be a
more mature approach both for freshmen and upperclass<
men. A freshman hall cushions the shock of college life
by allowing attitudes and goals quite unlike those of upper‘
classmen to he the predominating, nearly undiluted ones.
An upperclass hall requires of sophomores a complete
change of attitude toward studying, toward type of enter-
tainment, and toward beliefs. But an upperclass hall is
almost completely unoriented toward aiding the adjustment
it requires. '

These goals for integrated halls are much more import-
ant than the objection of freshmen that they “wouldn't
be as much fun” and the fear of upperclassmen that the
roorms they would live in might be smaller than they would
wis .

The advantages of integration for freshmen are the
opportunities to know andrutilize the friendship of a large
number of freshmen and upperclassmen, thereby having the
ability to decide individually and intelligently their own
attitudes toward college issues, personal beliefs, and study-
ing. Under the plans of the housing committee, freshman
leadership would be insured, andwould have a voice in
each of the integrated balls The advantages for upperclass—
men are opportunities to utilize the new ideas and enthus-
iasm of the freshmen and to play the part of informal
bafﬂe board if they; so desire. '

Women who have lived in' the semi-integrated halls
that exist now and‘in integrated halls at other schools are
enthusiastically in favor of integration. In light of ‘all its
advantages, it is certainly worth trying.

_ The Student Council, in its regular Wednesday .meet-
ing, decided to hear as a body proposals made by the Des
Moines representative of Pepsi-Cola company for placing
that film's machines on campus.

Dennis Watson, student Coke administrator will also
be present at the meeting to hear the representative and.
pronde the council with specifics on arrangements with

happened to be at the railroad
station on the Saturday night
before vacation.

I witnessed a good oldriashr
ioned sendoff. It was staged by
a group of Grinnell high school
students, many of them memr
bers of a drama class, some of
them contestants in the forensic
tournament held on campus,
They were there to say good-
bye to their teacher (a senior
”practice teacher" from 'thc col.

, lege) and they held the train

(She was late) with the con-
ductor looking at his watch
while she bought her ticket and
struggled aboard. IL was a lot
of fun and seemed to me to be

immensely worthwhile.

This use oi a high school
student‘s Saturdnymight time
shows a certain amount of the
spirit I talked about in the

on the council's financial posi-
tion in regard to coke receipts.

in continuation of other old
business, the council decided

to poll Students at housemeel-
ings in regard to their wishes
for having the libnry open
during Wednesday chapel
hours.

The action came following a
report by George McTimsey that
President Howard E. Bowen felt
the closing of the library durr
ing those hours to be a gesture
of deference to Grinnell’s relig-
ious program. but if student op-
inion were strong for a change,
the administration would review
the matter.
