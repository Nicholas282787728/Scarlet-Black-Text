The Chips Are Down ‘l

Although it hardly seems possible, the Student Councill
President election is only two weeks away, and will be
quickly followed by the election of a new League Board and
C of HP. Outside of the present importance of these offices,
these elections have an additional meaning. l

The student government on this campus has been;
given a careful analysis by a committee which has \\ ‘tten
a constitution for Grinnell Student government incorporat-
ing basic changes in structure and power alignments.

The proposals of this committee are presently under
study by the administration and by the Student Organiza-l
tions committee for the faculty. If, as we hope, the faculty
and administration accept the proposals, the student body
will vote to accept or reject the added powers and respon-
sibilities,

Because of the nature of the proposals, the facility and
administration will be watching' student conduct during- the
elections carefully, studying the caliber of officials elected,
to determine whether or not students can be mature and
responsible in the handling of their affairs.

When the elections are in mid-campaign, we hope the
student body will regard the candidates in light of both
their capability in handling student government as it existsI
now, and their leadership qualities, which would be re-l
quired for the institution of new machinery of student'
government and the assumption of more power and respone
sibility. _

We look forward to a wide and capable field of candi— .
dates, and an intelligent and discriminating student body.

All anti-democratic influences‘

for the Union to fight (as it

many of his policies.

The laws branch of the
A.C.L.U. is headed by such
