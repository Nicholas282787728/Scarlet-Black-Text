Ofﬁce Supply

Grinnell's contorence title
hopes face two big dbsmacles
when the pioneer cagers return
trotn Ohnistmns vacation and
again attack the issue at hand——
winning the Midwest contor-
ence championship. The ﬁrst ob-
stacle will be getting back into
praying shape site: the long vu-
cation layoff in order to clear
the second dbstacle, that of rac—
rng three tough conference op-
ponenﬂs within five days.

The Pioneers travel to North»
field, Minn, to take on st. out:
and capleton on successive
nights, Tlley face the oles on
Friday, Jan. 5, and then cross
over to the otther hill and play
the earls on Saturday, Jam. 7.
The scarlet crew then retains
home to play host to the defend~
ing champions, Cornell on Tues-
day, Jan. 10.

St. Olaf appears to be aha
strongest or the two Minnesota
schools as Carleton misses its
great guard combiniamion ol
Slocum and Rosenrolrrm. The
Oles record thus far has been
more impressive thanithat post—
ed by the Carls.

in the past years the Pioneers
have aiwtays been able to come
back from mpthe'rltartd with a
split, but this year if the Pier
nears ore mp to par they stand
a good chance to take a sweep.

ltt will be like going from the
frying pan to the ﬁre for Grins
hell when the powerful Rams
move into Darby for what
should he the best game of the
year. Cornell dumped Grinnell

twice last year on their way to
the title and the Pioneers would
like to reverse the picture this
year.

Cornell has Veterans Carlson,
Keck, Smith, and Gtatber us end
the Pioneer title hopes. The
game will pit (the best oﬁfen-
sive team in the shite, Cornell,
algalnsl the best defensive team
In the state, Grinnell. Daﬂby
should be hopping when the
Pioneers and 1the Rams lock
horns.
