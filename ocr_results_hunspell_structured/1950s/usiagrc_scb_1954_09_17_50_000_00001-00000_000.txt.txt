Last year the cnforccmsnt of
the drinking rlile on North
campus was in the hands of
lDean Brown. During a summer
conference in 1953, the 1953.54
0 of HP declared they could no
longer adequately enforce the
college rule. Consequently, the
administration took it ovor.

_ The entorcament of the drink-
ing rule on South campus was
the responsibility of the League
,Board last year as this year.

t Prior to 1953 the League
Board and the c of HP en.
forced the drinking rule on their
:respcctive campuses.
