Grlnnell’s 195253 basketball
squad earned itself a prominent
spot among the list of great
Grinnell teams or the past by‘
trouncing Monmouth, 101782,
in Darby gym last Saturday.

The Pioneer total broke the
old Grinnell scoring record of
91 points scored against Knox ‘
three years ago.

Roger Zimmerman calmly
scored six straight free' throws
in the last tension—packed min-
utes of play to give a desperate—
ly pleading crowd the maglc
three digit number, after three
other Pioneers had missed eight
charity tosses in a row, .

Leading all the way, Grinnell
was never seriously threatened
by the Scot cagers. Only once
was the score tred, with three
minutes to go in the first quat-
ter when the score was 22 all,
but the Pioneers immediately
grabbed the lead and never lost
it.

Torn Railsback sank a last-
second shot from mldconrt
just before the end of a fast
pnced first period, making the
score 28-22. ,

Grinnell maintained this mar-
gin during the second quarter,
retiring at intermission with a
six point lead, 5044.

Four Grlnnell players hit the
nets for totals in the two figures
column in this amazing point
production game. Winter scored
23 points, von Maur racked up
22. and Rails’back and Stum-
baugh each poured in 15 mark
ers. The pioneers connected on
49.3 percent of their fleld goal
attempts.
