From lhe Siands . . .

The scores were Knox 33
Grinnell 25, and St. Olaf 20 —
Grinnell 14. After both games
everyone was asking, “What
happened!"

Chuck Dnnham played .bril-
liant football. John McClintock,
Marv Clein, Don Hager, and
Nick Ryan were standouts. The
front wall, with few exceptions.
played good ball. Ronny Frank
and John Rueben, without
doubt, were the outstanding
linemen on the field, Then just
what did happen?

Sure, both Knox and St, olaf
had fine backfields with ex-
cellent pass patterns and. more
important, protection for their
passers. Both teams had good
running attacks to supplement
their passing games. The Pie»
neer defense had several lapses.
But. even all this doesn’t tell
the true story.

To get the real picture, one
must look far back into the
past, First of all there is much
football talent on campus thati
isn’t out for the team. Boys who
come out for the squad for the
first time when they are juniors
or seniors prove this, but then it
is usually too late to make good
ball players out of them.

Secondly, last years' rule
making freshmen eligible for
varsity sports proved itself a
low blow. Only eight men from
a large freshman class returned
to play varsity ball this season.
as compared to the average of
15 to 20 per class in other years.

Under last year's system all
the attention was given to the
varsity squad. and since most
freshmen aren’t’ good enough to
make the varsity, very few play-
ers were developed The import
ant thing is that freshmen one

i
again are not eligible for varsity

sports. This is a real blessing.
Many more boys will be taught
the proper fundamentals so that
they can fit into the Pioneers’
plans for next year.

Yet why isn‘t all the freshman
alent out for the team? Ignor-
ance is the main reason. Most
freshmen don’t realize that this
school has taken one boy after
another who never participated
in high school sports and has
made college players out of them
-—boys like Harvey Golden, Tom
Railsback, Bob Norton,
Johnson, Alf Johnsen, John
Uzodima, and John Thoma to
name just a lew.

The freshmen let themselves

get talked into playing intram.;

ural football with the thought in
mind that they can play varsity
ball next year. Those boys never
realize how one season of iris
dividual work as offered by

the freshmen squad can make a,

fair ball player good. This over.
.sight is a real crime!

What Tin trying to say is
that it looked like Grinnell lost

to St, Olaf last week, but actually‘

the varsity didn’t lose the game;
it was some students in the
stands. ’

All the teams that the Pie-
neers have played thus far use
the two platoon system. They
have fresh players in the game
all the time. The Scarlet and
Black has to play its fine first
string for practically the whole
contest. Boys like Clein, Dun-
ham, Ryan, Hager, Frank,
stumbaugh, Feidorowlcz, and
.McClintock must play both of
tense and defense They play
until they are dead tired
and often dazed. They take an
unneeded beating every game.

There is your story. That's

why Grinnell lost to st. olaf and
don’t let anyone tell you differ-
ently. in one word, manpower.

Whose fault is It? Certainly
not head coach John Pfitsch’s.
He can’t guarantee to some boy’s
mother that her son won't be in-
iured even though there are
more serious injuries in in-
tramural ball.

no can’t guarantee that a
boy’s grades won't drop even
though statistics show that more
boys grades go up than down
when they play a varsity sport.

no can’t make a boy want to
play football, and a boy will
never make a decent player if
he dosen’t have the desire.-

lt certainly isn’t this year’s
first stringers fault. Hats off to
those boys who play their hearts
out week after week. Sure
they’ll win, butinot as many
times as they would if they had
depth.

It certainly isn’t the other
squad members’ fault, either.
Most of them are getting the ex.
perience they'll need to help fill
gaps next season.

It is the other men on north
campus who hold the key to the
football team's success and fail~
urer They have no one to blame
but themselves.

If any freshman who.has the
slightest notion that he can play
football would give it a try at
once, he could do his part to
help build the new Grinnell era
of football that is slowly but

surely awakening. Now is the.
time.

Pioneers Battle
Unbeaten Team;
Meet Ottawa

A winless Grinnell squad will

‘ take the home field for the third

straight Saturday tomorrow at

:30 pm against an Ottawa
university squad which hasn’t
lost a game this season.

In their first non-conference
start of theseason, the Pioneers
will be up against a fast team
that does everything but drop
kick field goals. The fans should
have a good time watching the
Ottawa boys perform in not
one but three formations, the T,
the single wing, and the double
wing, all off an unbalanced
line.

The key man in the Ottawa
three ring circus is Jack Patty,
a 172 lb. senior who runs
and passes from the quarter-
back position off the 'r for-
mation, the tailback position
on the double wing, and
blocks when his team shifts
to a single wing.

To go with their tricky of-
fense, the Braves have a good
sized line averaging about 135
lbs,

Ottawa has use/d its versatile
backfield to advantage this sea-
son, for in their first four
games the Braves have scored
a total of Ml points, averaging
35.1 points per game.

In the last five years 0t-
tnwa has never ﬁnished bee
