Pioneers Lose 4H1;
Bea’ren By Knigh’rs
40-l2 In Thriller

By Walt Jacobson

If 15 minutes were A Complete
football game the Pioneers
might have won last Saturday.

In its second home appear-
ance last week our varsity
clcven jumped off to a fast
12 point lead only to have
Carleton catch up and go by.
The Northfielders left Grin»
nell with a 40-12 win as part
' of their luggage.

Moving quickly, the home
team scored on a 62-yard pass
from soph quarterback Steve
Bauserman to Jack Shaffer be-
fore 1,500 thrilled Parents’ Day
viewers.

After making a shambles of
Carleton’s defense, the Pioneers
scored again ‘ and that was it.
The rest was Carleton. Carleton,
Carletoni!

Breaks are a part of every
ball game. Injuries and inter-
cepted passes are bod breaks.
Maybe it was a lack of KIIth
and Nolder who were hurt
early, or maybe it. was hard—
or rushing by the Knight line;
but Balmrman's passes were
suddenly turned into Carl
touchdowns. Both Kllrth and
Nolder, two of the Pioneers‘
strong linemen, suffered in-
iured shoulders, didn't play at
all in the second half.

Junior Ietterman Jack Shaffer
was also forced to sit out the
second act due to an arm ail—
merit. The fiery little halfback
was sorely missed as his run-
ning attack, which pierced the
Carl defense the early minutes
of the game, was lacking.

The Carletonians are Sitting
atop the conference now, and a
Pioneer 0 and 4 record has cel-
lar written all over it. HOW-
ever, this reporter contends that
the record doesn’t tell the Whole
story.

This game was the second
in a row in which the Grin-
nellians played real football
—and lost. Recovering from
a heartbreaking defeat at Ri-
pon, Peterson’s squad played

Crosscouniry Team
Runs Quad Meet;
Loses To Carleton

The Pioneer crosscountry
squad will compete in a quad
rangular meet with Cornell, Du-
buque and Omaha this week-
end at Mt. Vernon.

The squad has been working
to improve condition in prep-
aration for defense of the Mid-
west Conefrence championship.
with two dual meets in the
next three weeks against Mon-
mouth and Knox the Grinnell-
ians plan to have enough com~
petition to bring themselves to
peak condition.

Meanwhile, Pioneer hopes
of avenging its only cross-
country loss or last {all were
crushed as Carleton‘s undefeat—
ed team ran over the Grin-
nellinns by a 2144 score last
Saturday on Grinnell's home
2.3 mile course.

Highlight of the meet was
visitor Wilbur Olson’s winning
time of 15:44 which broke the
course record set by George
Drake in 1953 by three seconds.
Olson was closely followed by
teammate Earl Neil.

Pioneer sophomore Chuck Yoak
turned in his best performance
of the year to finish third, 3
stride in front of Larry Schalv
eger.

Fifth through seventh places
went to Carleton; Grinnell
scoring was rounded out by

host to the strongest team in
the conference.

Blocking and tackling were
great. All conference lineman
John Larew, Bruce Wilkerson,
Charlie Adams, Bob Grindy and
Dick Thomas comprised a strong
forward wall. Gordie Loueks,
one of the smallest defensive
backs in the conference, has
been one or the toughest to get
by all season. Until injury forc-
ed him off the field he was a
real thorn in the side of the
visitors. And Jack “Sal” Michel-
etto did some good lincbacking
with his arm in a cost.
