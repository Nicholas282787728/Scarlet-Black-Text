Something- was finally done about class
Next year, absences will not be alloted according to ally
lule, but instead, class attendance regulations will be den
aided by the individual teacher. Students have expressed a
r'esire for a plan such as tllis for over three yea It has
row happened.

Another change was permission for seniors to have
cars all year. This is only experimental for one year; we
lop‘e it proves successful.

This year, the Board of Trustees held one of the
meetings while school was ill session. The weekend was
marked by informality. They Visited classes. met students
2nd participated in an informal coffee hour to discuss Grilr

ell with Grinnell students. This was one of the most
g r ifying events, for after their visit, we felt that the
trustees were really concerned with the students‘ problems.
We hope these meetings will be an annual event.

The highlights of the year are too numerous to even
list, From the consideration of news, it has been all excit-
ing and satisfying year. From the consideration of an
editorial writer, it has been pleasantly dull. We find that
vie have praised more than we have complained.

We congratulate the seniors as they leave Grinnell, and
give them our best lvishes. We’re sure they will especially
remember this year, and they will firmly believe that the
"Pioneers" have kept, and will continue to lieep, their pior

The reason rrn not going

From The President

Just one year ago at Commencement time Mrs. Bowen
and I were guests on the campus becoming acquainted for
the first time with many students, facility members. alumni
and townspeople. It was the be lining of a whole year
of “becoming- acquainted”iacquaillted not only with some
of the thousands who are part of the Grinnell family, bllt
also with buildin s and budgets, customs and practices,
history and traditions. and all those ingredients which to-
gether malie tip Grinnell college. For us it has been a very
happy aild satisfying.r year because of your friendly and
patient help. Without it a “freshman” president would be
lost. We are deeply appreciative.

_ lt would be difficult to say what about Grinnell has
impressed us most. We could cite the alert and intelligent
quality of its students, the skill and devotion of its faculty,
the loyalty and genera ity of its alumni or the faithfulness
and wisdom of its trustees. Grinnell is blessed by having
all of these Because of them Glinnell possesses something
mote valuable than all its buildings or all its endowments.

"nod name. The reputation of Grinnell college stands
high \vhelcvel you may be a symbol of academic excellence
and honest devotion to the ptlrsllit of truth.

As Grinnelliaus you have helped establish and main<
tain this good name alone with thousands before you. You
are entitled to share in its prestige, I hope you will also
accept your just responsibility for sustaining' Grinnell's good
llanle through service to the college and a life exemplifying
those qualities for which it stands.

To alumni re-uniting with their friends this Commence-
ment weekend, to parents of the graduating class and to
all other friends of the college who are here on this happy
occasion we say welcome to the campus.

To the freshmen, sophomores and juniors who will
be returning to the campus in September, we extend best,
wishes for a wonderful summer.

And to the Class of 1956 we ei )ress pride and satis-
faction in your achievements and Wish that the future
will fulfill for each of you the bright promise you have
shown in yollr years at Grinnell.

Yours sincerely,
Howard R. Bowen
President
