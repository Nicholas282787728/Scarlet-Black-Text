the 1955 Rosenfield Lectures.
“Creeping conformity, not sleep

danger in the country today. In
turning our faces toward con-
formity we face stagnation and
rigidity, which produces the
whole process of erosion of
freedom.“ ,

It happened this way, accord

Waterloo Symphony Orchestra,
Jelinek thought he‘d do a little
shopping at the Osca Drug
store. Being 3 resourceful man,
when his shopping basket reach~
ed its capacity, Jelinek used his
pocket as an auxiliary. After he
had payed for the goods in the
basket, the storekeeper asked
him, “Haven’t you forgotten
something?" The absent minds
ed professor answered "no”,
upon which the irate storekeep-
er pointed out the items in his
pocket.

Our embarrased and forget-

and to make reparation but to
no avail, and wound up posting
a $100 bond for $8 worth 01 vit-

will be settled tomorrow.

Three foreign Students Enler College;
Represenl Japan, Germany, Venezuela

By Mary Mills and Nancy Abel

Three foreign students are among fche 18 new enrollees
this semester. They are Ichiro Takeuchl, from Japan, Oscar
Antonini from Venezuela, and Juergen Roennau from Ger-

many.

Ichiro Takeuchi, whose home is in Tokyo, attended a

Japanese naval academy for three years, and was com-
missioned a lieutenant in the Japanese Navy. Later he
attended Hitctsubashi University, and graduated Wlth a

purpose in at.,.
tending Grinnell
is to learn
about “the Am-
erican way of ‘
life, language and girls.” ichiro
attended Columbia University in
New York for four months, but
he found it utoo big for making
friends".

An unclassified student,

lohiro ill spend one semes-
ter auditing classes in politics,
history and economics, after
which he will return to his
job. When he arrived here
lohlro met another Gﬂnnell
student from Japan, Kenlclii
Sawada, and the two were
quite surprised to rind that
their homes in Tokyo are
within a few minutes of each
other.

From Caracas, Venezuela,

He has gone
home to Car.

turn again this
summer. Oscar, _ -
a first semester»
freshman living‘ "
in South Younker. plans to at-
tend Grinnell for two years and
then transfer to Columbia to
take advantage of the engin-

eering program which leads to
degrees from both schools. En-
thusiastic about Grinnell, except
for the "awfully cold" weather,
Oscar says he chose to come to
school in America “because if
i stayed at home i would have
no time to study. I’d be too
busy having fun."

faculty meeting. it will also be
presented by Acting President
Hawk at the next Board of
Trustees meeting, Norman Mar.
ble, Superintendent of Build-
ings and Grounds, stated Wedv
nesdny.

“The main purpose of the pro.
posal is to relieve congestion in
the bookstore and mail box
area,” Marble said. it would
also release space in the library
badly needed for storage, and
space in the basements of the
‘Y‘ building and ARI-l now used
for storage by the bookstore. .

Proposed sketches of thp new
bookstore and post office,’ drawn
by Marble, provide for three
rooms~a storeroorn on the east,
the bookstore in the middle, and
the post office, including student
and possibly faculty boxes, on
the west. There would be separ-
ate entrances to the bookstore
and post ofﬁce; the east door
would open into the bookstore,
the west door to the post office.
Both doors would be at the
front of the building opening
onto the porch.

Marble emphasized that not
too much work would have to
be done to adapt the building
to its new nse.‘The roof of the
porch would have to be rebuilt
and some tuck pointing would
be necessary. “There needs to
be a decision made about Blair,"
he declared.

At present only the east base-
ment of Blair is being used. It
was enclosed to be used 10: the
construction and storage of sets
for Gadabouts and the student
musical. The west end is now
being readied for use by the
recently formed Amateur Ra-
dio club.

Juergen Roman had a real
taste of American life when he
was drafted in ,

eight months

after he left I)

after his graduation 1mm Grin-
nell. "

At present he is an unclassi-
fied student. Juergen ﬁnds
Grinnell different from colleges
in Germany, Where “school is
just for studying." In Germany
:uei-gen had 34 to 36 hours per
week of actual classes, and
took about 16 subjects. Sum~
