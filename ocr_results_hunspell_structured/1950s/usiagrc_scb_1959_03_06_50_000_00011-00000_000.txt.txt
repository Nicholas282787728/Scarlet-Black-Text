with 52 points iollowcd by St,
Dial with 26, Lawrence with
23. hipon with 22, Grinnell with
20v; and Carleton with 19%.

The “even-point spread between
sccond and sixth places indi-
dated the tough competition for

teams in

This year, in Coach Young's
opinion, the (knee teams to
beat are Cornell, St. Olaf and
Rim)“. Cornell's strength lies
in the sprints, the low hur-
dles, and the 440. with Ron
Alleuberg. last year's outdoor
conference champion in the
hundred and 220»Vard (lashes
and the 220-vard low hurdles,
as the team's mainstay.

Ripoli’s strength is in the field
Outstandlna‘ arr two of
last year's outdoor champions.
Kassoii in the pole vault, and
Tomczak in the shot put.

St. Olaf's strength lies in
its allrarollntl athlete Dennis
Runcli who was last year’s
outdoor lllEll jut-nu rlnmpion
and who placed high in the
hundredrvnrd dash, the broad
jump and the pole vault.

Vanna llamnﬂ Ernie Ruther-

‘ iord in the pole vault. Al Fisher

in the hroad jump. and Gary
Slavbaugh in the hurdles as
three probable point—setters for
Grinncll. He also evpected seVA

teams will? Strong rontenders.
ll' Grlnnell runners live up to
Young‘s expectations, tliev

the lopsided scare, Grinnell

somc good performances, ac—
cording to Young. Especially
good for so early in the sea-
son was Chuck Yonk's 4:363
mile. his best ever by four
seconds.

Young was, well satisfied with
pcrtormcncc of his‘_ team,
which he thinks has significant—
