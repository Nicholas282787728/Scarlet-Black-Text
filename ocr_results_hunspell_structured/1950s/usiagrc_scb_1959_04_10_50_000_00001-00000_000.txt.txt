to regain the spirit ,oi the sub—
jects covered by the test but

The play, "The Summoning}
oi Evelyman" 'or
"Everyman" will be presented
Wednesday morning in Herrick
chapel at 9.

Both the author and the
date oi the ilrst production oi
“Everyman" are lost to the
modern scholar, but the best
estimates seem to place the
time around the last hali oi
the iiiteenth century. The
play ltseli is one at a rather
large group usually called
the Morality plays. in these
plays, the characters wcrctyp-
ically allegorical and oiten in-
volved the conﬂict oi Good
and Evilrfur the soul oi an
Everyman or Mankind. (it this
group “Everyman" is gener-
ally ranked at the top or the
list in terms oi dramatic ex-
cellence. - .

Bricily, thc play tells oi the}
call oi Everyman (Joe Nassif)‘
by God through his messenger
Death (AI Stanley) and the at
tempt ot' Everyman to find'a

l
l

Simply,‘»cdmparlion to go with him to

death. 'He is, of course, unsuc-
cessful in this, and in the and
finds that only his Good Deeds
(Sylvia Spencer) will stay with
him,

The play is being giv'cn in ’

the chapel so as to use'the
aisles as well as the Nave for
action. This is being done to
more symbolically portinytl»

allegorical characters w h u
make up the play.
Moi-antics dealt- with the

problem of, teaching Man/ to
live a better or more Christian
liie. Yet this did not prevent
the use at some very subtle
comedy in the plays and this is
also true oi “Everyman."

Bciore and after the play E14
bert Smith (c liege organist)
will play med' val music.

The play, an independent
project ofJane Hicks, is being
co-directedby Jane, and John
Backus. -
