Dear editors:

We of the election board
would like to take this opportun-
ity to express our views on the
election procedings and to point
out some factors that we feel
are important.

One point that most students
do not recognize is that we at
Grinnell have a chance in par»
ticipate in ft form of election
unique on the college level.
Grinneil is the only school in
the Midwest conference that has
a convention system. We feel
that this opportunity to particie
pate has been neglected in past
years and not enough emphasis
has been placed on the Serious»
election system; enjoyment and
educational aspects both, have

their place.

In view of the forthcoming
national elections it is especially
pertinent that students take an
active interest in our election
procedings. Since our local col-ls
vention is patterned after the
national convention, it offers a
way in which to‘ gain first hand
experience in the democratic
process of electing our presi-
dent. With this in mind. we
urge each member of the stue
dent body to take an active part
in the election in order to bone-
fit both himself and the candi-
dates.

We sincerely hope that ins
creased interest will provide
more candidates and wider par.
ticipation. \

Dear editors.

We would like to commend the
world relatedness committee of
the YWCA for the excellent dis
plays on quad bulletin boards
this past week.

They have focused attention
on one of our major weaknesses,
our overrattention to Grinnell
matters and our lack of concern
and knowledge on national and
world affairs. We hope that
there will be other projects of
this kind to arouse our awareness
of campus provincialism.
Sincerely yours,

Deba’res One-hour Final Tes’r
Facul’ry Reconsiders Exams,

by Barney Gissenaas

The Gl'innell faculty has be-
gun general discussion of the
present examination system.
However, even if the faculty

‘should vote to change the sys—

tem, a new one would not be
instituted until the first semes-
ter of next year.

Discussion of the exam system
is a result of the provision
made in 1948, when the present
system was instituted, that the
present exam system should be

reconsidered after several years,

of operation before final
proval by the faculty.
A questionnaire was mailed

to faculty members recently

up:

asking for criticism of the ,

present system and pref-
erences, ii‘ any, for a [new type
of exam system,

With approximately 60 percent
of the faculty returning the
questionnaire, the results were
as follows: (1) the faculty over
whelmingly approved a mini
mum of three onerhour examina—
tion; (2) the grading value of
the one-hour final examination
was unquestionable, but a mar
jority of the returned question-
naires opposed it as a teaching
device. .

Objections to the onerhour
final were the following: (1) it
was not long enough to test
students on the content of the
entire course; (2) it was not long
enough to stress integration of
the course material or applica-
tion of the course material to
practical problems; (3) it gave
the students no experience with
longer examinations before the
graduate record and senior com-
prehensive examinations.

In general, the faculty seemed
to prefer three different exam
systems: the present system, a
system of two one-hour exams
and a tworhour final, and a
system ’of two anarhour exams
and a three-hour final.

After considering the faculty‘s
opinions, the educational poli-
cies Committee recommended
continuation of the present sys»
fem. lt agreed the system was
fine for grading purposes, and
it recommended the faculty make
use of term papers, oral reports.
and assigned questions for the
final exams in order to inter
grate and apply the course ma-
terial.

In their opinion, the inex-,

perience of students in writ-
ing longer examinations when

they reached the graduate rece
ord and senior loomprehensive

examinations was not reason
enough for change.

The memorandum of the
executive council made the fol—
lowing conelusions: (1) at least
two onierhour examinations were
necessary, regardless of the nae
ture of the finals; (2) longer
finals are not necessary for bet.
ter grading; (a) when longer fie
nal examinations were practiced
at Grinnell, the faculty did not
make use of them, often letting
the students leave the tests

vearly; (4) problems would arise
from longer finals which would

i be difficult to solve.

Statements from a represnta-
tive group of faculty and admin-
istration members follow;

Paul Kuntz (philosophy):
"Students who go to graduate
school are going to meet longer

ing our duty to those students
in not presenting longer final
exams. Longer exams would take
much more time, but 1 prefer
.the longer final examination."

George Lovell (psychology):
“1 am perfectly satisfied now,
but I am not opposed to a
change by the majority of the
faculty.” ,

Kenyon Knopf (economics):

“1 am one of those who initiat-
ed consideration of the longer
final examination."

c. Edwin Gilmour (political
science): “I am satisfied with the
present system, but I am agreee
able to change."

Joseph Danforth (chemistry):
“I prefer the longer examinar
tion, but 1 have found that i can
work well with the short exam."

Max Fuller, dean of the Cole
lege: “I favor the present sys-
tem for the two courses 1 now
am teaching."

William Boyer (political
science) I believe that the two-
hour final examination will
raise the educational level of
Grinnell college.”

D. H. Hauptmann (foreign
language): “I think that the pre-
sent system has worked well. I
am moderately in favor of the
present system."

in favor of keeping the spac-
ed hour exam through the sen-
ester, but I think that a. lung-
er final exam at the and is
necessary." ‘ ,

E. F. Andrews (English): “I’m
rather sorry for students who
write three, even one-hour, ex—

I’d read better exams were this
not so. The onerhour plan
should not be blamed for this
fact."

1 “i do not, personally, feel
handicapped unduly by the one-
hour exam system. A different
plan might offer added flexi»
bility for some courses."

mum limit of the number of
hour exams, and am in favor
of a longer final exam."

President Samuel N. Stevens:
“1! was upon my recommend-
ation that the faculty put in the
present exam system. There
were three reasons for this: the
professors did not use the time
IallDwed; the long terminal exam
produces more mental and emoL
tional, difficulties for the stud-
ents; and a system of three prop-
erly placed Cnerhom‘ exams
keeps the students on the ball
all through the semester. 1 think
it neither desirable nor wise to
go back to the threerhour final
examination."

political suicide around here, and
anyhow, he’s too busy with his
;route. Jim. Fellows has friends
‘iin the right places but he's an

Ted wickinan is being dis—
criminated against by our vicious
grading system and is therefore
at available for political plums.

lthat he is passing. up the Stu-

of Cowlcs hall’s gavel.

lget the job; they don't think
,vcry much, as a rule, and that's
ja prereouisite The trouble is
that no female could swing the
,ouad vote, and you can‘t win
without that.

An ideal candidate for the

student Council throne should be
a waiter at the quad, not have
a steady girl. smoke a pipe, wear
lluminous socks and neckties, be
seen regularly at chapel and
vespers. be a motor-moron, and
maior in euthenics. Big feet

herd book in search of other
possibilities I came across the
:name, Fergus L, Doody. l don't
know who it is, but the name
‘alone should pull some votes.

certain persons have ap-
proached me to inquire of my
availability as a candidate. Well,
I’m awful sorry, fans, but I’ve
made up my mind. If i can’t
be Fatima representative on
campus, 1 don‘t want nothin'.

I shall close on a‘ political
note: who are the goons who
circulate all the silly petitions‘
about cars, motorcycles, and the
food? Someone ought to start
one against sin, and maybe
ianother against winter; I’ll sign
:that last one.

 

l According to figures released
by the registrar's office, on-
rollment in the college for the
second semester is 837. This is
a drop of 21 students from the
first half of the year.

Of the students now registered,
450 are men and 337 are women.

Semester withdrawals includ-
ed 27 students plus 16 graduat-
,ing seniors. 14 students also,
withdrew during the semester.
