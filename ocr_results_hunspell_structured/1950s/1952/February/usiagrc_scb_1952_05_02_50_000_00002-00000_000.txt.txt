Music, Music, Musical

Remember ”Mary Jane,” the “Philosophers‘ Song,”
and “Dream of Love"? They’re songs from the last tWo
musicals, songs Written by student oomposers which have

an appeal for all Grinnellians.
Eighteen new songs Will be presented _
“Sing Man, Sing.” Some of them Will

night's musical,

in tomorrow

undoubudly go down in Grinnell musical history.

Grinnell’s musical history is long. Since the oollegewas
founded, students and professors alike have been writing
outstanding songs and compositions.

Recently the best sources of lyric songs have been
the Gadabouts musicals. But the college record library is in
danger of losing the songs that entertained us in “Up a

Tree” and “Then Was This
only person on campus with
the songs from all three of

Island." Jane Gaddis is the
a good musical knowledge of
the student productions. And

Jane is graduating this June.

There have been no clear recordings cut of the songs
from the musicals. If Grinnell wants to preserve the songs
we have liked for future generations of students, it should
be an established practice to cut suitable and adequate re-
cordings at the time of production.

To the editors:

From September ’51 to Feb-
ruary ’52 when I returned to
Gtinnell, I was working on the
American Red Cross blood bank.
And because I am so interested
in this program, 1 would like to
pass on to you a few facts con»
cerning it.

Every month, the armed forces
are short three hundred thous-
and pints of blood. Three hun»
dred thousand pints of blood
means three hundred thousand
lives. Grinnell students and fac-
ulty are asked to donate 400
pints or 1/750 of the monthly
need. It seems to me that if we
stopped to think of the need for
blood, we wouldn‘t hesitate to
donate a pint. It doesn’t hurt
you and it takes your body just
twelve hours to manufacture
the pint of blood you gave. Reac-
tions are very few and 98 per
cent of these are psychological,

And incidentally, men black out‘

much' more often than do we
man.

I’d like to tell you cf an inci—
dent that happened to me during
my work and I hope it will im»

press you as much as it impresed '_

me. Although i enjoyed every
minute of it, Red Cross work is
hard work. It means uneven
hours; you are on twentyefcur
hour call; and you don’t receive
a cent of pay. On January 24,
l was to be chairman of the
day. This involves taking com-
plete charge of the unit, secur»
lng volunteer workers, ironing
out all problems, answering all
questions, and generally keeping
things moving smoothly.

This was my first experience
of this type and there were times
during the day when I thought
i was just five minutes away
min a mortal institution, “We
need a hundred pounds of crush.
ed ice, Miss Skeel" . . . “What

,time do we clcsc, Miss Skeel?"
,. , . “Telephone, Miss Skeel.” Ai-
,‘ter nine sclid hours of this, my
llegs were so weak I could hard-
ly drive myself home.

1 had just sprawled out on the
davenport to relax when the
phone call Came which seemed
ltc pour strength back into my
legs and aching back. it was our
chapter president and this is
what she said to me, “You might
‘be interested to know that the
Red Cross truck picked up the
lchests of blood at five this eve-
ning. They are in Cleveland now
on their way thrcugh the lab,
and by two in the morning, they
will be on a plane headed for
lKorea,” Right then i knew why
11 had worked so hard.

‘ A subcommittee of the social

calendar committee is investiga-
ting the possibility of buying a
student-owned movie projector
liar use on the campus.

Committee members are Beth
Budd, Loose hall senior and in-
[fcrmal social chairman. Jack
Reddan, Dibble junior and Studs
ent Council president, Grant
lGale (physics), and Norman
Marble, superintendent of build-
ings and grounds.

The projector will be student-
jowned and maintained; however,
since the students have been us
ing the college projector, the
new machine will be
available to all the academic de<
partinents as well as student
organizations and those in charge
of informal social affairs, Both
projectors will be used for
movies so the show will not
have to be interrupted to change
reels.’

Eisenhower, Re

In Siuden’r-Faculiy Primary

General Dwight Eisenhower
received 5l percent of the total
vote in a student faculty pri»
mary poll here Wednesday.

With 55 percent of the stud-
ents and faculty voting, returns
showed a marked dominance of
Eisenhower and the Republican
party in general. On the Demo-
cratic side of the ballot, Gover-
nor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois
and Senator Estes Kefauver of
Tennessee ran about even, out—
distancing all of their rivals.

With about '73 percent of the

students voting Republican, thej

votes were as follows: Eisenhow-
er, 246; Senator Robert Taft, so;
Harold Stassen, 24, Governor
Earl Warren of California, 21;
General Douglas MacArthur, 5;
Henry Wallace, 1; Paul Hoffman,

From The

Many students have questioned
various officers of the adminis-
tration as to whether an increase
in the overall cost of attending
Grinnell college is contemplated
the ensuing school year. The
facts are these:

1. We began the school year
1951-52 With slightly more than
850 students, with a budget of
nearly $1,400,000 and an operat-
ing deficit projected at $274,000.
Every effort has been made to
maintain expenses at the rate
at which they were budgeted,
and at the same time we have
made strenuous efforts to raise
enough money for current opera-
tions to avoid a serious indebted-
ness.

ln‘spite of our best efforts
it appears now that our operat
ing expenses will amount to
nearly $60,000 more than our
budget. We have been able to
raise about $130,000 for current
operations. Our deficit at the
end of the school year will, in
spite of everything, he more
than $200,000.

2. in view of the fact that
operating costs are not declin-
ing-in fact are slowly but stead-
ily increasing in all areas of
our institutional lifcgand in
View of the fact that the college
cannot continue to exist very
long if it incurs annually an in-
debtedness of $200,000, ii appears
to the president wise to ask the
executive committee of the board
of trustees to give serious cons
sideration to this problem. A
recommendation was made to the
executive committee that an in
crease in tuition and in certain

Approximately 22 percent of

ancillary fees, but not in room
and board, should be made.

3. At a recent meeting of the
executive committee it was
unanimously voted to recom-
mend to the full board in June
that the overall cost be raised
$100 of which $80 would be a »
plied to tuition and the remain-
der distributed among the var-
ious ancillary fees.

4. The board of trustees at its
meeting in June which will oc»
cur on June 9 will make the
official decision. 1 think it is
reasonable to suppose that the
increase will be approved. if
it is, announcements will be sent
out immediately to all interest-
ed parties.

5. l think it is only fair to
point out that almost all p'
vately endowed educational i —
stitutions and most publicly sup-
ported institutions have been
forced to raise their fees for the
coming year. ,

Many eastern schools are now
charging more than $2,000. Carlee
ton has raised its fees to $1400.
The state schools in the area
have also raised their special
fees and their board and room
charges. We sincerely wish that
We were not having to face the
byproducts of national infla-
tion.

6. it should be pointed out that‘
students for whom this increase
constitutes an undue hardship
which can lbe demonstrated will
receive sympathetic consideration
for assistance in the form of
loans, work or scholarship as
resources permit.

in the next few days my
colleagues and I must decide
who is to get all the Brown
Derby prizes like the funnel and
the liar’s medal. We’re not sup-
posed to hurt anyone’s feelings
and that's going to take all the
fun out at it.

No one wants to get the fun-
nel because it looks bad in the
5&5, especially if your parents
have a subscription. For you
freshmen, the funnel is awarded
to the campus drunkard, A pair
of rabbits is awarded to the
most prolific couple on the
campus and this is just short of
absurd, because we are about the
least prolific community in the
Whole wide world - in spite of
ourselves. Journalism professors
don’t count.

I’ve got a new idea for a prize
and I’ve met some opposition
from certain quarters. My prize
wouldn‘t hurt anyone's feelings.
exactly, but it might cause them
some embarrassment and this is
what bothers my SDX brothers.
I think that they mightstillbe
talked into it; that is, ifwe aren't
hindered by the older and more
reactionary professional mem-
bers. Wherever you turn there’s
always that old guard to put up
with.

I can‘t tell what the new
prize is because all persons who
considered themselves eligible
candidates would leave town and
we need their money.

l'in proud to announce ‘l’ve
been elected the president of my
clique. ln Cowles hall we not
only have cliques, but we are
darn proud of it. We elect of~
ficcrs and make pacts and every-
thing and when a member of a
clique breaks the pact, We hold
court and sometimes we kick a
guy right out and he has to find
himself a new clique. Boys have
been known to crack up over
things like this.

As a matter of fact, one of the
fellows in my clique did sort of
crack up a few weeks ago — he
was delirious and everything.
However, I’m happy. to report
that he’s all right now, although
he didn’t .get elected to any
clique office because n chap in
his condition can’t be trusied
with any such responsibility.’

We don’t allow these cliques to
interfere with our athletic pro-
gress, and that’s why we win
everything. .

I hear that the C of HP had
their annual \beerrbust the other
night and I think that’s the
funniest thing ever. I can’t
imagine any member of the c of
l-ir having a beer-bust or any
other kind, for that matter. But,
that‘s as it should be, of course.
