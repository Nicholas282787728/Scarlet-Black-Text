The Grinnell Student Coun-
cil unanimously approved a
resolution for a college-wide
boycott of the college laundry
and dry cleaning agency at
Wednesday night’s meeting

- l'n 'Younkel- lounge.

The resolution, proposed by
Charlds Mathis, Gales senior,

, urges all students to patronize

laundries and dry cleaners in
town until the college agencies
are returned to their former lo-
cations in Cowles and Main

’ halls.

Reasons oﬂered by council
members for the unprecedented
boycott are that the present lo-
cation of the cleaning, luundry,

; and parcel post agencies is in—

convenient and relatively inac»
during the muddy
months; that the new centrali-
zation of these services is de-
priving students or jobs; that the
lack of adequate space and fa-
cilities in the heating plant
creates a bottleneck during the
lunch hours; and that heat of
the building has led to the spoil-
age of food parcels. Council
president Jack Reddan is con-
ducting an investigation of this
situation concurrent, with the
boycott in an effort to return
it to the system of previous
years.

The council also voted to hold
all class elections at the same
time. The weekend of Oct. 17-18
has been tentatively selected for
the voting, which will be set
up and organized by present
class officers.

rrank Graif, Clark senior, will
head a committee to investigate
the complaint that many stu-
dents were not notified of the
opening date of college and were
subsequently fined for arriving
late.

It was also announced that
a washing machine for men will
be available at the heating plant
within a week.
