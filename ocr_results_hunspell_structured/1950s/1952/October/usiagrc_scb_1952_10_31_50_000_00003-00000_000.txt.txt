Librarians Find Mass Destructio

The library start discuvel’cd‘

last Friday that all articles
' concerning Senator Joseph Mc-
Carthy had‘boen torn out or
recent newspapers, when a stu-
dent looking through the par?
pers round that all the material
was gone, ,,

Upon turther investigation at
the matter, Helen Hammond
(librarian) found that other mar
terial including sports articles,
news stories, editorials, and tull

i pages had been removed from
the papers. These newspapers,
which include the Des Molnes

- Register, New York Times, and
Chicago Tribune. are on micro.
tilm for the permanent library
the Mrs. Hammond reports,
“But tor current news the actual

,papers are the only available
research material in the li»
bl'ary.”

Hilda Godt're’y (library as—
sistaiit) pointed out the l‘act
that the law in this state cons
earning the matter has not
been posted in the library
and therefore some students
might not llzwe realized that
they were violating a state
law in mutiliating library ref-
erence material.

The law reads: "Any person
who shall willtully, maliciously,
or wantonly tear part of any]
nevtspaper, periodical, book,
map, phainphlet, chart, picture,
or other property belonging tol
any public library or reading
r'oom, shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor and shall be

; rined not more than $100 or imr
prisonment not more than thirty
days." (Penal Code or Iowa,
714.16)

‘Eecause the college library,
was partly built with Carnegie
funds. it is considered a public
library. This law has never,
been enforced by the college
library. ,

Students have long been guiL
ty of underlining and marking
reserve books, as well as ripe
ping articles from these books‘
rather than “bothering to
take notes," ]\ Hammond‘
points out in her display now
on exhibit on the library. ‘

Recently, articles train the ,
Encyclopedia or Social Sciencs, t‘

ly and American Mercury, and
