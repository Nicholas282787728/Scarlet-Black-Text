child, and will begin an ex-
tcnsive welfare program, in-
cluding food, clothing, medie

years. it is non—profit, non-pu-

pendent or any government aid.

Johnsen called this
the most worthwhile projects 1

to “give generously" to this
cause.

The council, meeting last
night, also read a letter from
Ben Jones, headwaiter ill

the atmosphere serene" at
meals and preventing the “din-

Grinnell athletes have made
exceptionally fine academic rec.
ords over the years, with a
good share of Phi Eetes among
them. it seems strange that
sports and grades can no longer
mix. it seems even stranger that
the activities on MacEachron
field produce more enthusiasm
than those of Ward stadium.

possibly. if points were
awarded toward the MacMurray
trophy for membership on var-
sity squads, some of this divided
loyalty would find its proper
place again. This, and the end
of inter-hall transferring and
proselytization, might provide a
solution to the whole problem,
Certainly, there is one.
