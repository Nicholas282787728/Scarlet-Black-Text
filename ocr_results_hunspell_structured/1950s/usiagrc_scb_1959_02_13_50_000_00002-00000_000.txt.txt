 

Acid and Base

by John Stocking

You students of Grinnell do not believe in ghosts. 1 can tell
that by the look in your eyes, the cool calculating look that says,
"I am a modern." F. Scott Fitzgerald Wrote of the Ghosts he saw
at night when the lights for study would first come on in halls
of Princeton, and he described those lzhoslts as they walked the

Princeton campus There was the great halfback, the six loot tall

190 pound bolt of lightening
who had smashed the conference
records on the Ivy League grid
irons 20 years earlier, and end-
ed up with a broken neck, lying
across the goal line in the big-
gest game of all.

Fitzgerald saw that ghost

walking back to the locker room
one crisp fall evening, over the
path from the practice fields
which was packed hard from
100 years of football cleats.
There was the ghost of a little
runt ot a scholar, too, sitting
way back in the stacks of the
great dark Princeton library.

Last wee s column was a
painful example of What
can happen when one's
rough draft is printed instead
of one's third revision.

And there were a lot more.
There was a ghost for every
man who ever Went to Prince
ton and died, in the war, in
the depression, in the rocking
chair or hospital. It’s no use
talking to you about that,
though; you don’t believe in
ghoss.

And I’ll bet you do not
know about the time some
preps built a handsome brick
puthousc, lile size and com-
plete with a roll of toilet
paper, cemented onto the steps
of all! more or less beloved
library. The dean of the wl-
lege tried to knock it down
with a tack hammer. No, and
you do not know about the
time they butchered a hog in
huwson hall's Second floor
John, and the sheritf came
and took then. down for what
looked like would be a. four
month stay. You don’t know
and you don't care. You have
more important things to do
and think about. You are
modems.

Grinnell has had her great
backﬁeld men. I found them in
some yearbooks, stacked in the
closet of a very creaky old
alum, 1 found out who ChriSA
topherson was. He led the team
to three conference champion.
ships, or something like that. I
found him there in a moldy old
yearbook, hidden away in dust
and paperbound glory. The
seniors would never have told

me about him. I had to hunt
him out of the past, Fitzgerald’s
freshman Class did not have to
look in the closet to discover
their immortal 190 pound half-
back. He was there beside them.
He was in the Princeton man's
heart and soul, there to live
till the old brick walls vaporize
in that last cosmic desil‘ltegra»
tion.

The Cowles Eagle rusts
quietly away in Rock Creek
Lake. A iew of us tried to
pull it out with a rope last
spring. We were going to put
it on the Younker‘s Tower and
paint it parrot green, but the
rope broke, It has sunk in
10 feet of mud by now. That
eagle did not belong in the
Grinnell of today. It was be-
coming it real live tradition,
and you couldn‘t stand for
that. They threw paint at it,
shot it, cursed because their
hall did not have one, and
finally buried it into 10 ieet
of mud. Freshmen in a tow
years will not know it ever
was.

No, Grinnell has no live tra—
ditions, in the making, only old
ones dying. It has no heroes,
Heroes and traditions are imper-
lect things and so they must be
criticized. They must be criti»
cized to death. Everything must
be criticized, sneered at or dis—
regarded as unreasonable. And
even if there was a perfect boy
at Grinnell . . . six feet tall,
190 pounds, little All-American
for three years, straight A,
handsome, witty, and modest,
you woud not make him into a
hero. You would criticize him
for being too perfect,

It was my freshman year
when I went to the alum’s
creaky house, I was fortunate
to have been shown so early
what I was being cheated out
of having. Ever since that day
l have believed in ghosts. They
are still here. The War, I am
told, did away with what had
been Old Grinnell. The tradi.
tions and heroes which had
been were forgotten in that bit-
ter, sarcastic time. The war
killed a lot of men, but you
cannot kill ghosts. I started
looking, and they are still here,
During the hell night of this
semester (probably the last hell
night you will let take place)

Jack Franjevic (art) has won

mentions in the second annual
religious art contest sponsored
by the Des Moines Area Council
of Churches.

His work is included in the
exhibition of 61 entries which
opened last Sunday at Willkie
House in Des Moines. The ex«
hibit will now be shown for a
week at different churches dur-
ing the six weeks of Lent

an oil, “Entrance of Christ into
Jerusalem." He received honor-
able mention for another oil,
“Shrine to Madonna and Child,"
and in sculpture for a ”Crucifix”
in copper and silver on wood.

the fog filled air was full of
ghosts, the ghosts of preps out
on their insane little chores.
Some of them must have died
at the Bulge, or in the trenches
of the other war. It was fright-
ening, but it wouldn't scare you

Money In The Wrong Hands?

The Handbook for Men, prepared by the COIHP, states that
the “purpose of the Council of House Presidents shall be to direct
the legislative, executive, and judicial functions of the men of
Grinnell College, and to cooperate with the administration in
furthering the best interests of Grinnell College." The constitu-
tion of the AWSB contains much the same statement of purpose.
To accomplish these ends the two governing bodies are given 50
cents per student which amounts to almost $250 for each of the
groups. And, of Course, they obtain additional capital through the
levying of fines,

Why then, we ask, are the CofHP and AWSB provided with
additional revenue for the operation of washinE machines on
north and south campus?

according to the student auditor’s books. Why does this much
money rest in the hands oi so few people? Why does the CofHP
have the right to Spend $103.25 at Loyd’s Restaurant for a party
in October? Wily does the CofHP have the right to donate money
to various groups; at their discreion?

We do not doubt the character' of the students in this group
at all. We believe that anything that has been done. is not the
product of any dishonesty on the part of the personalities involv—
ed, but the product of a student government plan which has
basic detects. The AWSB l'ecifies his to'an extent through a meet-
ing where all women vote on dlspensition of the funds.

The biggest question is why aren't the washing machines
under the control of the council. The council which has an unr
doubtedly better use r'or the money. The council which represents
the entire student body would dispose of the money in he name of
the entire body.

This week the 5&3 begins a series of articles on the social
situation at Grinnellr We believe that in doing this we are not
creating an issue but providing an outlet for the widespread dis
satisfaction that we have seen on both north and south campus.

In our opinion this seems the opportune time to treat this
i§ue. [1 student opinion, as evidenced in next week’s poll, is sym-
pathetic to change, the students will have the immediate chance
to elect a council president who stands for what they stand for
and. anddwill provide the leadership in council that can ammplisll
