Cont. from 11, 2

Christology based upon a “Con-
centric-circle topography” of the
human selfr As cutler sees it,
the outer circle is the social
self; the intermediate circle is

the fact that Dr, Outler was
obligated by time limitations to
omit large porions of the last

I found the lectures exceedingly
stimulatihg and demanding,
