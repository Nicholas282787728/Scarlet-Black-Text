Cagers Open at North Central

Dunlop Only
Sure S’rar’rer

A relatively green squad will
take to the hardwoods tomorrow
as the 1950 cagers make their
season debut against nonecon-
ference North Central at Nap-
erviue, Ill. The Pioneers, al-
though playing on a strange
floor and with inexperienced
personnel for the most part,
hope to duplicate their victorious
67-62 season opener here against
North Central last year. Dunlap
scored 26 points that night.

Minus the services of four of
last year’s regular starters,
Pfitsch is faced with the prob-
lem of building a completely
new winning combination. He
will be without the services of
Bob Bigelow, whom he canside
ers the best rebounder
conference.

Only Dave Dunlap, who scor-
ed 374 points for a 20.8 average

to become a unanimous all-con- ‘for seventh place in the State.‘

ference selection last year, is
sure to start. That the rivalry
for the other four starting as-
signments has been tremendous
over the past three weeks is
evidenced by the highly Com-
petitive spirit and hustle of the
entire squad during practices. ‘

In the hopes of finding ba1-‘

will employ a number of dif-1

Acquinas Hall at Providence col-

a rendezvous. At the Sludent

of Coca-Cola is always on hand for
the pause that refreshes—Coke
