Brown Visits Two

Dean of Men Henry A. Brown
paid visits to Rawson and
Cowles housemeetings Monday‘
night to explain the academic
probation procedures and to ask,
that, in house council elections.l
the men elect representatives
that “assume responsibility for
enforcing the regulation in efvl
feet, while trying to make im~‘
provements at the same time."

Brown stated that he person-
ally believed that, if a man my
cepts a nomination, he should
assume the responsibility of sup-
porting all the rules if elected.

“House government should be
a shared responsibility among
all house council members, also,"
he said, “not just that of the
house president." He asserted,
that hall officers should also-
feel a responsib ty to hall‘
members, by trying to improve
conditions.

in an interview with an
- 5&8 reporter, Brawn empha—
sized that his visits implied
no criticism of the halls in
question, but that he planned
to visit a housemeeting of
each hall ‘once a semester, to
improve communication baa
tween the administration and
the students.

He said he believed that a
lot of the diiiiculties in this
area stem from a lack of un~
derstanding from both view-

Brown said.

When asked why he planned
to have only one such visit per
hall each semester, he replied
that he wants to avoid giving

viewpoints on the hall."

Besides Bawson and Cowles,
Brown has visited housemeet-
ings in Clark, north Younker
and Gates.

Brown explained the aca-
demic probation procedure as
follows: Regulations state that
the Personnel board either warn
or place on probation all stu-
dents whose averages are belovirr
72. In each individual case,
which of these two alternatives
is taken is decided by the iboard,
which may be advised by a‘
special subcommittee and/or the
individual's counselor.

This semester, wishing to
avoid subjective, borderline
decisions, the board placed on ‘
probation all students whose
average was below 12, .with.
out exception.
