One of the tasks being con.'
sidered for the preps is a clean-
up of various church yards

erous suggestions for improving
and changing the prepping pro,
gram are being prepared and-
will be suggested to next year's
C of HP.

A more thorough revision of
the prepping program was plan.
ned last summer. The C oil-1P
had intended to meet with form-
er President Stevens in August
to work on changes. Due to his
resignation this meeting could
not be held and :he decision
was made to postpone any ex-
tensive changes. Ferguson ad~
mitted that he didn’t feel satis-
fied with the way prepping is
now handled and that Dean
Blown feels it could be morel
constructive.

When asked about the pro.
gram Cowles has set up for
its preps, Ferguson said that he
thinks much of it is a good
idea but that he would be Con-
cerned if freshman in other
halls were to become dissatis.

He emphasized that each hall
is entitled to set up any pro.
gram it wishes as long as it
abides by the rules set down by
the C of HP. Because of the
plans of a constructive nature
now being contemplated, Fere
guson expressed the hope that
Cowles would include themselves
more fully in the C of HP pro»
