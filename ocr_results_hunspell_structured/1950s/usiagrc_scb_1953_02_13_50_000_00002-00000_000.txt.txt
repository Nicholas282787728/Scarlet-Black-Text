I SEE |T ONLY TOOK TUO
UEEKS TO GET BACK INTO

THE SwING OF THINGS AGAlN.

\ Step Right Up

Besides finding jobs for graduates, arranging inter-
views with companies, and in general trying to see that
the Grinnell student isn’t lost when he enters the Wild out—
side World, the placement bureau in the ad building offers
a service valuable to all students. Maybe you haven’t heard
about it. ‘

It’s a battery of tests, useful in choosing a major field,
a future occupation, or picking an interest away from the
classroom, that is available to any student who wants to
take one or any group of them. -

Testing aptitudes, interests, achievement, or person—
ality, the program is suffering from disuse while many stu—
dents are foggy about future plans. Only 27 persons took
the 'tests last semester; there seems to be no line forming
at the present time.

And it doesn’t cost a cent for all but one of the exams,
A charge is made for that one only because it must be
sent away to be graded. The tests may not be as good as
a complete psychoanalysis, but we think you’ll find them
fun, and helpful“

Wattrs-Anlloullces New Job Opening:

Several announcements con—

 

cerriing job interviews for sen-
iors were made this week by
Harry Waters, placement bureau
director. ‘

Waters emphasized the imports
ance of pre-graduatlon interviews
for all seniors, even if immediate
military service seems likely. He
explained that contacts made
now can be of great value.

The placement oriicc can
compile a folder of information
needed in job and gredunte
school applications. oiten this
material is most easily and or
rectively compiled before grad-
nation, Waters said.

“Most companies aren’t inter-l
ested in what major fields theiri
applicants have concentrated,"
he continued. “Specialists ore
wanted only in the sciences."

Next wcelr representatives
will 'be on campus from the
Travelers insurance company
and General Electric. An in-
terviewer ror Armstrong Cork
company will be it Ames next
week, too, '

Seniors are asked to come to
the placement office in the ad-
ministration building to sign for

I'm taking a lot for granted,
The truth may be that there are
just sixteen innocent per—

that would be the fifteen stu

were representatives or the var«

them reported stealing in his or

I wonder how the outlaw
must feel when he sits around
amongst his victims discussing
the malignancy of his own fel-
onies. It probably causes him
little or no discomfort since his
diseased morals are immune to
guilt feelings, or so the consis-
tency of his crimes would at»

1 hove always considered
Grinncll unique among colleges
in that its regulations are de-
signed to discourage all kinds
of ostentation. Our manner 01
dress is unpretentious. The man
who dresses too meticulously or
expensively gains the notoriety
or foppishness. We are not al»
lowed to keep automobiles or
motorcycles on the campus. He
who does is Spoken of as a
showoff and an abuser of priv-
ilege. We have our fops and
our show-offs, but they rarely
win popularity contests.

We have no fraternities to
glean mlllionalres' sons for their
mobbish ranks. The boy who
depends upon the wealth of his
antecedents for social recogni-
tion is frustrated at Grinnell.
There is not a single bistro in’
this town at 'which one can
lavish more than a few dollars
at one time.

There is some gambling in
each of the men's halls and I
hardly think that's a bombshell.
There is also some drinking.
These transgressions are costly,
in themselves and in the van—
dalism to which they often
lead. It is conceivable that some
students are driven to bur-513:1
by these economic pressures.
However. I hesitate to place all
the blame in such a restricted
area. The girls steal although
they rarely gamble or get
drunk. Our League Board can
be Elven credit for that. If the,
rivalry for clothes drives girls
to crime there should be a lot
more women on our public
enemy lists.

Pei-ham We’ll never know
which of on: classmates are
guilty until years later when we
read of their scandals in the
daily newspapers. it would be
nice if they could be sent to
the same penitentiary so that
they could recollect their col-
lege “jobs” together.

 

All students are invited to;
