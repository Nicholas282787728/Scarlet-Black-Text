Senator axn Boner: has been entire-

tion that this opportunity was given
to publish a woman's number, edited
by women and containing matters at
special interest to them.

It has seemed, thereiore, that there
is an urgent need tor a. third literary

college. When we see Cornell and

cieties to accommodate all its girls, we
realize that something ought to be
done here at Grinnell towards Inrnish.

genuine and as such it should receive

S the poor girl lonely ‘ln Iowa Col-
lege‘? The answer to this question
determines the social spiritofour insti-
tution. If she is, she cannot blame
the student body. We do zriot here a
commercial standard according to
which we estimate human worth:
there IS iioproperty requisite for oilicc-
holding, The popular student is the
one who deserves to be popular, ilutl
experience has proied that no amount
oiiiioney or social position can com-
mand undeserved popularity.

ly limit their membership lists. For
the most part they are open to any

that respect. The possessois oIsoroi
iLics may consider it bud taste on our-
part to depreciate lratcriiul organioe
tions, but he .rnnot help feeling that
their presence in Iowa College would
detract considerably from the spirit or
social equality which prevails. The
only aristocracy we encourage IS an
urist cy or character. and social
position or money are minor coiisiilcriu

THE CHAPEL AND CHRISTIAN

ASSDCIATION BUILDING
since the beginning or the student
campaign, started in December, to
10,000 for the Chapel and Asso-

,l00 have

raise
ciation Building project,
been pledged or paid. At the same
ate. with this month and April in
which to accomplish the work, the
whole amount ought to be easily se-
Ii the perrcr-al hotly oi students

wnl takethe matter to heart as earn-

cured.

estly as some oi tliestudeiits hare, this
month ought to score a victory tor the
enterprise. Pledges aird casli have
come in or all sites, trom titty cents to
one thousand dollars. Many oi the
smaller-gins are the concrete symbol
or a great sacriﬁce. Seine students
h‘ -e done what is the most ditlicnlt
thing ior them to do, ask others ior
money. Other students have develop
ed wonderiul powers as solicitors.

As an erainple or what students can

do when they set about it, Miss Ruth
Reed and Mr. Harold IIutcliins deter
mined that their home church at Al~
goiia should give 5150 to the chapel
rand. They wrotchomeand arranged
with Rev. 0 II. Holmes, the wide-
awalre pastor, to have President Brad-
ley visit the church February 20th.
While home on his vacation, Mr.
IIutclrins addressed the congregation.
Dnringtlie wee]: preceding President
Bradley‘s visit they sent personal let-
ters to the members oI the church
The result was that though a lieroe
snow storm was scheduled Ior that
date. a large congregation assembled,
pledges were taken and $14 secured,
asuni which will doiibtle s be lllcl'czlsr

such co operation is bolllrl to mate

but to cultivate for Iowa College a

ORDER IN CHAPEL.

Mentionoithc new chapel always
brings the thought or the added at»
tention and reverence winch a room,
wortliyoi use for sacred purposes, shall
inspire. There is much in the size.
the shapeuiid the decoration or a room
which eiiects the senses and. indirect
ly, the emotions. And yet, men when
we acknowledge the inﬂuence or ap-
propriate surroundings, ‘ we must
admit that the right sort of a spirit
makes any room set apart ioi- worship,
sacred.

Dr. Steineronce described our chapel
as ”unspealcztbly ugly," but he showed
us how it is the spirit or the worship-
pcrund not the architecture or the
building which makes it a sacred
place. Somehow the students this
year here not seemed to realize that
the chapel is the one place in ourcol—
lege lite where we ought to get array
from the little annoyances and temp.
tations which come to the students
every day and get something at an in—
spirat ion {or our better selves. There
has been a marked lack oi reverence,
both in upper anti lower classmell,
which did not pass away after the
tirstiew day of school. as is usually
the case. But tallring, laughing and
disorder iir passing outhavc marred
many or our services,

Much or this irreverence is due to
thollghblessness: brit there is no excuse
tor being thoughtless about a matter
which has been brought to the atten-
tion so otten as this one some care in
regard to our conduct will help to
maintain the sacredness which in the
past has generally characterized our
