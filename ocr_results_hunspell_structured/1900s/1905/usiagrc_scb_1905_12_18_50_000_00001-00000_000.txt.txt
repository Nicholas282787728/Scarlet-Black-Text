Dr. Steiner characterizes Mr. Car-
negie, as he sat waiting his turn to
appear on the program, as a good

arose he proved to have force and
strength or character that was very
impressive. Mr. Carnegie said that
if he owned America he would actual-
ly pay a premium for foreign immi-
grants and immediately there wasa
suggestion tliata collection be taken
to present him tlle five per cent that
