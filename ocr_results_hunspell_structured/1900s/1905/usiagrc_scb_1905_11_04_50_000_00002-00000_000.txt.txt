MASS MEETING.

Ii enthusiasm is any index asto the
outcome of the 10th game, then S. U.
L will be snowed under so deep that
they will not. get out, until next Julie.
ID is no exaggeration to say that Griu~
neii students nevei‘ showed as much
spirit or enthusiasm as they displayed
at the Wednesday night meeting.
The spirit of Mike Bergen was evident
throughout and everyone caught, the
spirit, which he showed before the
Drake game,7lt was not, "Can we
Win or is it passibie7. but “we are
going to win,“ regaidless of what-Iowa
may think or do.
