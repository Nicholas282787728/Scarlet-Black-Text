THE GENERAL RECEFNCN.

Women's Gymnasium is Crowded Willi
Alumni Friends and Studenrs oi
lowa College—A Social Success.

According to the custom of iormer
years the lll'tyrseventh general rccep
tion took place in the Women's Gym-

nasium Saturday evening, The pro-

gram [or the occasion, in the hands
of the Social Committee with Ralph
Lyman at its head was arranged and
Carried out with excellent taste. It
did not (lill’ei’ greatly from the pl‘Or
grams ior Silnilial occasions of the
past but still there seemed prevalent
a spirit which made the :til'air an “n
usually enjoyable one. The readiness
with which the new students are en-
telinginw the Spirit of the college
has been observed from their ﬁrst ap-
pearance on the campus a week ago,
and the fact that they have already
grasped in alarge measure its mean-
ing was certainly demonstrated Sate
urday evening,

The stiuness and lormality which is
usually so much in evidence was laid
aside. Each greeted the other with
genuine enjoyment, and only too soon
did Mr. Lyman call the audience to
order to announce the ﬁrst speaker of
the evening,

Dean Main mounted the platiorm
and in his characteristic sincere man
ner delivered a short address of Wele
come to the new Students after which
Professor Ryan spoke on the many
and varied sensations experienced at
the general reception, the pleasure of
making new acquaintances and the
ray of renewng the old ones.

President Bradley made the last
speech of the evening in which he
payed a flattering compliment to the
“Griilnell boy" and the ”Griunell
girl.” Tile Gl‘innell boy. licsaid, was
the type or man who could take re-
ligion with hiin;in to all the phases at
his college activity, in society, in the
class room or on the athletic Licld. and
Lllc Gl’illnell girl he characterized as
beautiful. modest and sensible.

A few of the old time iaVOUKES by
the Glee Club, closed the program [or
the evening. Joe Walleser ’D.i had
consented to tell of his Oxford exper~
iences but his modesty overcame him
and hecould not be found when the
time came for him to speali.

Tile gymnasium seemed to he more
crowded than ever and it is generally
believed that this was the largest
number that has ever attended the

opening reception.

The regular makeup examinations
will beheld on Saturday, September
22rd, in Room 3, Library building, at
ii A. M.

The Christian Endeavor Sociely
will give an iniorinal reception to the
students ol the college on Friday even
ing, Sept , in the Conierence Room
at the Congregational Church. All
students are invited to attend.

\Vhen interviewed hy_a. SCARLET
nxn BLAL‘K reporter yesterday he
consented to give a iew interesting
facts in Connection with his college
life. He said that the school life is
unique in many respects. Students
are very flank and you come into
close contact with all of them. They
have opened their doors to the ioreign
students, and do everything in their
power to make the students welcome.
The English student life differs in
many respects iroui American student
life. Frats and sororities are unknown
and the Englishmen cannot under-
stand them. Culture is general among
the students and liie among them is
a reﬁning experience.

They are great lover-s or out door
Sports and every afternoon lsdevoted
to some llind of games. Hockey, foot—
ball,cricket, lacrosse and others are
played during the year. and the
American students take an active
part in athletics. Professionalism is
unknown and there is no call iorit.
The English student can take defeat
without being discouraged and does
not :feel elated over victory. They
are very-even tempered and take all
things as a ma tter of course.

Mr. Wallesel- ﬁnds that his allow»
MICE is ample Inrhis needs although
expenses vary greatly illille colleges
and some students have to receive
help lrom home. He is taking work
in English Literature and Modern
Languages and ﬁnds his work very
agreeable. The tutorial systeln- is
used and it depends Oil the student as
to what he accomplishes. He said
that he had not been real homesick
although he often thought, of his
American home. He came home this
ratation to get u better ideaol Ameli-
can instutiolls alld Ideals and would
now be able to compare the two coun-
tries more closely. He has visited
London and Scotland in his vacations
and expectsto travel in Germany and
Greece during his vacations next year.
