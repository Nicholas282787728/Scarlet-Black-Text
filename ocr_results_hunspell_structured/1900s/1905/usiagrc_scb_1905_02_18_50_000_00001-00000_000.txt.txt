and there need he no fear from its

There is a popular Iailucy that the
musician must necesarrly be over
balanced. It has oiten happened that
heis but such instances are usually
due to an orer emphasis uihis musical
trainingin early years and tin-ough-
oritliie. Tire part or charity is to
judge genius by its contributions anti
not by eccentricities, Ilcwever, it. is
not always the case that great musi-
ciuus are trained when children nor
that they are bigoted, so to speak. In
Iact the greatest. of them now are oi
the ve , broadest culture. The case
of Madame Bloomﬁeld Zeislei is a
newbie illustration.

And music is an essential adjunct
to a liberal education. The oppor-
tunities in Griiihellto cultivate the
musical appreciations are many. more
abundant r illy than iour-iiiths oi the

ﬁnd them again. ,\ little attention
