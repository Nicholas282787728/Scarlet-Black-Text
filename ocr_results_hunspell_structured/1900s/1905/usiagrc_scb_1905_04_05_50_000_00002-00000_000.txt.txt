SATURDAY'S FiELD MEET.

Tire ﬁrst of u long series of ﬁeld
meets will be held Saturday afternoon
or this week when the sophomore and
freshmen measure their blades ID the
anuualdual. It will be remembered
that the meet of 1904 resulted ina
close victory for the present class or
sophomores and that 130- is the ﬁrst
class nameto be engraved upon the
Dan. ll. Foster unpaird that although
no number of victories can give per-
manent posession of this trophy the
sophomores are hardly the less anxr
ions to be enrolled again as winners.
The freshmen are equally anxious or
course to share their rivals honor and
the result is bound to be seen in the
spi
day on Saturday.

Dupe ﬁends who have been busy for
several weeks at the task of forecast-
ing the out come of the meet have
been able to come to no very deﬁnite
conclusion. In fact there has been
noclass'meet in Ieceub years where
the result was so thoroughly in doubt.
Careiul estimates vary only a iew
points one from the other on either
side, the totals usually Iooting up ac-
cording to the sympathy or the spawn
lator. Prophets agree in expectinga
close contest.

But if the dual of 1905 is to be ex-
ceptionally close it also promises to
be the occasion of some excellent per»
ful‘mances. From present indications
the men are in luily as good condition
as ever at so early at date, thanlrs to
Mr. Fisher‘s thorough Work with
them and to the excellent spirit llilll
which all candidates have carried on
then-or ortraiuing
