POPULAR 50VEREIGNTY.

Protessor Allen Johnson gives an Inter.
pretation nirhe Subject in n
Recent Publicaunn.

The January number of The Iowa
Journal of History and Politics pub-
lished quarterly by the State iIistori-
cal Society, at IowaCity, contains an
interesting article on “The Genesis oi
‘Ilopular Sovereignty” written by Pro-
iessor Johnson.

Popular sovereignty was the all iiii
poi-cant question under discussion in
our local and national lire during the
decade immediately preceding the
Civil War. Prolessor Johnson views
the subject irorn tlis standpoint ot a
student oi history and treats it in a
most impartial and scholarly way.
Hisknowledge’has been gained irom
the most reliable sources as the refer
ences in the iootnctes clearly shotv,
and his judgment is not arrected by
local or sectional inﬂuences. He dis»
cusses the subject irom a purely non-
partisan basis.

Protessor Johnson begins his article
by discussing the criginoiths doctrine
or popular sovereignty, Various men
have been recognized as the author of
this doctrine, among whom are Cass,
Dickinson and Douglass. but to
Stephen A. Douglass must be given
the honor—iiindeed it is an hmlol’i
oi stating the doctrine in itsiinal icrm.
Cass and Dickinson may have sug»
gested it but posterity has generally
considered Douglass as its chieiespon.
elltr.

The dlcbrilie is clearly stated by
Douglass in an article contributed to
Harper’s Magazine in l 9 The run.
damental principle in it is that the
people oi territories and political com-
munities are regarded as having the
right to determine tor themselves all
policies concerning taxation and inter»
nal polity.

The author regards ”the tap root
train which popular sovereignty grew
and llourisllcfl to he Lhe instinctive (U.-
taehineiit oi the western American to
local govcrnm‘ent; or to put the mat-
ter conversely, his dislike oi external
authority. Intense individualism,
bold initiative,stroug dislike or due
thority, elemental iealousy or the
iruits or labor, and passionate attach-
ments to the soil that has beencleared
tor a home are qualities found in vary.
ing intensity, among the colonists
irom r'cw Hampshire to Georgia."

The political habit wasborn in these
iioutier settlements which ﬁnally in a
later period showed iortli in the doc-
trine oi squatter sovereignity. The
organizations which were iormed by
the early settlers all tend to show how
the people took upon themselves the
problem or local seii government.

The sovereignty oi the people in the
territories had been clearly demon
strated even beicre Cass or Dickinson
suggested the doctrine in Congress.

THE UNIT,

A Literary Man’s Opinion at Iowa Col.
lege's Literary MagazineiAl-I Ins
teresting Article to Appear.

Although as a general rule the pages
or “The Unit" are open, only to those
intimately connected with Iowa Col~
lege, whether in the capacity oisrn-
dents, alumni or instructors, the an-
nouncement of the editorial start that
G. Walter Barr, editoroi “The Keokuk
Standard” and author or “Hacklic”
and other novels, will be given space
in the January ”Unit", hardly strikes
usasa new departure when we con-
sider the subject or his contribution,
“Western Colleges and Literature."

Mr, Barr is loyal to this riawlreye
State or ours and is ambitious for Iowa
Literature. In the December ”Unit"
[or 1903 there maybe found in an Edi-
torial on Mr, Barr's prediction that
“Iowa will be in the next wave in the
growth of American Literature, and
its approach is to be heralded by the
college spirit, in Iowa.”

We are informed that Mr. Barr has
been in receipt or “The Unit” for the
past year and a hair, so that his opin-
ion oi it and its value and possibilities
are not without reasonable rounda-
tion.

Tire article is tiriiely. Now when
the Required English Classes are be-
ginning to “try their hand" at narra-
tion, this article or Mr. Barr‘s ought
to suggest to many a ireslimnn the
possibility of “getting into the work-
shop” oi notion writing and by taking
alittlc more care than usual in the
way or carciul revision, to send in his
or her contribution to the “Unit.”
Older Students as well, will better-
appreciate the opportunity diluted by
the “UniL”, aitcr reading Mr. Barr's
article.

All in all lowa College ought to be
proud oi the impression she is able to
make on an outside literary man,
through the medium or her literary
magazine, iorina letter to the Unit
management, MI. liar-r makes the re-
markable statement that Grinnell is
doing better literary work than any
college west or Chicago.

There will appear also in the iorth-
coming “UniL” an article on awell
known novelist of today, by a student
who is iamiliar with his home. It
seems to us iortunate that this should
come rust at this time, ior we are a
sured by the “UnlL” stati that ths
article on Charles Major will make
the “trade” of writing seem more ab-
tainable, and loss distant irom nui-

average experience
Registration ior the second semester

in the Academy will begin next week,
Exact time to be announced later.
SbudenLS bllould bear Lllis matterin
mind and be making their plansior it.
It changes are to be made they should
be carefully considered beiore lland.
