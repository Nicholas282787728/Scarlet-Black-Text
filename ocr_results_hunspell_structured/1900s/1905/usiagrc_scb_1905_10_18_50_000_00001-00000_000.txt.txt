The football Lenin from (Joe College
was treated L0 all exhibition of Grin?
nell mud and football last Saturday
when the scarlet and black sent
home tlle men from Cedar Rapids after
beating them by a score of ‘5 t0 4‘ In
reality the game was by ilo means that,
Close, The ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of play
brought the touchdown ior Griniicil,
and it was but little later that a pretty
placclricir gave Coe her score. From
then on the Whole game was a repeti-
tion of splendid marches down the
ﬁeld toward Coe‘s goal, With tlle lif—
teen-yard line alilnitovei‘ which Grin-
nelicould not get. Alter advancing
the ball steadily for forty or ﬁfty
yards, a fumble or other misfortune
gave the ball to the Coe men, who im~
mediately punted out of danger and
compelled Grluuell to do it all over
again.

Coe learned early in the game that
there was no chance for her to gain
through the Griunell line. Time after
time her backs charged, trying to ﬁnd
an opening, but only twice were they
able to make their downs in this way,
and many times they were thrown
back for losses which aggregated more
in yards than all their gains. In run-
ning the ends Coe had even less suc-
(less. A twelve-yard run was the ex-
‘tent of the grollnd gained, makingfour
the total number of times they ad-
‘Vanoed the ball ﬁve yards, including a
penalty on Grinnell for otiside play,

On the other hand Grillnell was able
to gain almost at will, through the
line Or around the ends. But; little
panting was done ill the first half and
none in the second, the team being
held for downs only a half dozen times
throughout tlle game. There was
much brilliant work by the back ﬁeld,
every roan being good for a gain every
time he was called on, but the thing
which glnddened the hearts of tho
fans more than anything else, was the
stonewall eil‘ecb which the Grinneli
line presented. The charges of Doc 5
backs were stopped with it suddemless

and Grinnell, thc rcorganlxalioii oi
the local Union, and with the large
number or iicw men enrolled hi the So-
cieties, the debating interests of the
college have rcceivednn .v lease or
liic. Neverbeiore has there bcenso
much interest shown in debate as at
the present time. It is a hopeful sign
that Grinnell will yct assume the posi-
tion in debate that she lids in other
lines of college activities.

As was announced last spring, an
Intercollegiate Triangular Debating
League has been iormcrl by Drake.
Alnesand Grinnell, Theorgaiiization
is similar to the one in the East, com-
posed of Cornell, Columbia and Penn-
sylvania. The chief feature is that
the schools all debate on the sonic
evening and on the same question.
This requires that every college is rep-
resented by two teams, one of which
debates the ciiirmarive, the other the
negative, By this arrangement six
men have the opportunity or making
the varsity where before only three
were selected. This fact accounts in
some measure for the great interest
shown indcbatiug this fall. _

Negotiations have been going on the
past lew weeks and tlle question for
the debate, which will occur in March,
will be. “Resolved, That, whenever
