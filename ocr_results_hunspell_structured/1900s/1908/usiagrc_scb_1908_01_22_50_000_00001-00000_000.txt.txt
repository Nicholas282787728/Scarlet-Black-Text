second basket. ball game. The game
showed considerable improvement
over that ol the prerious week. Both
the passing and basket throwing Were
of n. more satisfactory order. The
One men handled the hall well, but
could not hit the basket. The game
was fairly fast and should have been
better attended. Klein was the star
of the day, throwing thirteen baskets
from the ﬁeld. The Grinnell team

The lo ll Gallic.
After a curtaiirraiser in which the

iowa Iijroshmen beat the lowa City
high school as to 12, Grinnell went
down in dcicat 26 to is before the
superior players of Iowa.

iowa seemed better able to throw
hnskots, while Grillnell was poor in
this respect, only getting tour has-
kets. This was due, no doubt, to some
extent, on not being accustomed to
the ﬁeld. larva was guilty or exceed-
ingly rough play, having 27 iouls coll-
cd, mostly lor rough play. Buckner,
Iowa‘s captain, was the worst offends
er in this respect, ﬁnally being put
out of the game after having ten
called on him.

Grinnell came up with a spurt at
the beginning of the second hall, score
ing ﬁve points in succession.

The refereeing was good, but a good
many kicks were registered from both
sides. Epperson called a. great many
fouls, and as a result was somewhat
oi a mark (or the stands. Epperson
refereed the ﬁrst half and Rydeu the
second. _

The game was played under inter-
collegiate rulcs. The score in detail
explains the result.

lIUMBOLDT SOCIETY.

Professor R. B. McClenon Reads Paper
On the history of Mathematics.

At the regular meeting of the Hun]-
boldt Society last evening. Proiessor

McClellan dealt in a most interesting
manner with the history of the num-

her side of mathematics.

The ancient peoples had very crude
methods of numbering, many nations
simply using arbitrary signs, which
rendered impossible the Writing of
large numbers, or the performing oi
more than the simplest operations.
Tile Greeks had letters of the alphabet
represent certain numbers and by this
method could designate numbers as
large as 100,000,000. but no greater.
The Chinese performed quite compli-
cated problems in arithmetic, using
simply their ﬁngers to ﬁgure with and
from this practice of using the ﬁngers
tor counting grew up our decimal sys—
teln. some ancient peoples used both
their ﬁngers and toes, and thus origie
nitted the method of counting by
scores. With such crude methods of
notation the ancients found it almost
impossible to use fractions, \

Three great divisions might be made
ir- the history of Mathematics, the
Greeks, Hindoos and Arabians, and
Modern Europeans. Among the Greeks
the names of Pythagoras, Euclld and

Deophantus stand out prominently,
each one of these men making great

advances in the use and theory ol
uuulbcrs.

Tile Hindus are noted for originat—
ing our present system at notation.
which is perhaps the greatest contrie
bution mathematics has eler given to
the human race. The 'ahs illev
duced it into spain in the eleventh
century and from this fact it is known
as the "Arabic Notation."

Among modern Europeans, Fremont,
who lived in the seventeenth century,
was probably the greatest mathemati-
cian, but Euler, Laorange and Gauss
also made important additions to the
science.

Although such great advances have
been made in mathematics in the past,
the present indications are that the
lutnre will open up still wider ﬁelds.

Enjoyed By All.
Mr. Carlo Fischer proved himself a

master of one of the most diiiicult

cl: Chapel

of instruments in his 'cello

last night.

recital
A clinging resonance of
tone, much musical insight and case
and brilliaucy of execution character»
ized Mr. Fischer's work throughout
the taking program. The most ambi-
tious number. the Ruhenstein sonata
for 'cello and piano, was enthusiasti-
cally received, Miss Shutts receiving
a generous half or the applause for
her excellent work at the piano.
Mr. Escher succeeded in varying
his music to a surprising degree. This
was noticeable especially in the classi-
cal group which consisted of "Nina,"
an intensely emotional composition,

and a rollicking “Rondo." Perhaps
the favorite with the audience was

"Ls Cygne," by St. Saens, which
was played twice, each time with won-
deriul purity of singing tone find a
nameless pathos.

An unusual and distinctly pleasing
feature of the recital Was the short
talk on the ﬁne Old instrument which
“'st used, and a. brief sketch oi some
of the selections chosen which Mr.
Fischer gave in an interesting man-
ner.’
