can game of Rugby at Grinncll. None
or the undergraduate body had ever
witnessed a game and the professor":
experience had heen merely that ol a
spectator. In consequence the attempt

was without result.

The following year tt happened that
two men, “Lon" Van Gleson and Frank
Everest, who had contested the pie
vlons year on the pi-aparatoi-y school
mama or Bordentown Military Acadr
emy and peddia institute, came from
New Jersey and entered iowa College.
A tew oi the old association players
were soon interested in the game. Afr
ter many attempts enough teilows
assembled at the old Academy Chapel
to make a showing. They, following
the usual College custom, appointed a
committee to formulate a constitution
and by-laws, George A. Lyon, Frans
Everest and A. Wright. 0n Octoher
24, 1339, this committee reported and
their constitution was adopted. The
lallawlng omcera were elected: Press
ldent, James Allison; vlce president,
H. J. Macomoer; secretary and treas-
urer, Frank Everest; manager, A.
Wright. The president, vice president
and manager formed an executive com~
is-iitea.

constitution and by-L’tws and paid the
