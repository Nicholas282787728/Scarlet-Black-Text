team.

L. G. C. Pierce, or the class oi 1900,
the captain ior the season just closed,
began his iootball career in the Grin-
nell high school. He played guard on
the high school team for three years
from 1902-5. During his ﬁrst year
Grinhell held the state high school
championship, The second semester
of 1905, he spent in the Academy,
Registering in the College the follow—
ing year, lie has played guard on the
'varsity team continuously for tour
years. “Beams” knows the game from
start to ﬁnish. He is one oi the
hardest workers and most consistent
players that Grinnell has had. These
qualiﬁcations combined with his long
experience in the game made him para
ticularly fittell tor the captaincy, which

he has ﬁlled in a most satisfactory

manner. ‘

Throughout his course Peirce has
maintained an exemplary grade at
scholarship, and has taken an active
part in class and College aiiairs. tie
is a member or the Chrestomathian
Society.

W. A. Ziegler, '10, next years capo
tain, is a graduate ot the Goldiield
high school. He played inll hack on
the high school team during the last

 

two years 01' his CouI‘SE, no team hav-
ing been organized untii that Lime.

Entering Iowa College With the class
of 1910, he played with the reserve
team during his Freshman year, being
barred from the ’vdl‘sity team by the
intercollegiate l‘ules'. For the last two
years he has been it tower of strength
on the ’V’al'sity at tackle. lie was
picked by the Register and Leader [or
this year's All-Iowa team. We quote
the following from Sunday's palm!"
“The two men (Ziegler (Ind \Vilson of
Drake) played Wonderful ioothall at.
tackle this year, Thel/ are placed at
guard on the AllrIowd team because
of their ability to stand any amount
of punishment, open up holes, block
punts, mud fathom the play of the 0p-
position with ease."

Perhaps these words irom Coach
Andrews Will CDBVEY some idea of
Ziegler's Capacity in the football line:
" HZig." could make the Yale or Har-
yard team with ease the [ii-5L year.”

“Zig.” is probably connected with
as many outside activities as any man
in College. He is an the 'Vm'slty track
team, a member ot the Glee Club; the
president of the Junior class, and Id
member of the Chrestomathinn Soci-
ety. in addition to these, he is actively
engaged in Y. M. C. A. Work, and he
always maintained a high standard of
scholarship.

Gl'innell is especially tortuiizite in
her choice Of captain for next year.
The team, the student body, the Col-
lege as a whole is pleased With the
choice. With “Zig.” at the helm, the
success of next year's football Season
is assured.

Sparks, the best all round center
Grinnell has produced for some time,

His work has been the quiet, persist-
ent kind which may not be universally
recognized as the sLelli-ll' sort, hilt
whicllmevertheless, shows on the tail-
ly sheet oi every game.

Ziegler, -tbs captain-elect, was the
only Grinneli man to place on the
all—lowa team for 1903. His position
the past year at tackle was probably
the strongest in the line. At advanv
ing the ball, Ziegler was always sure
or a gain. He, also, will ﬁnish his

Brundage is still in school, and with

Greenwood, the other llncnian re-

The new men did not show the term
on the "scrubs" team which appeared
with last year's class. Chrismim, Hun-
ter, Elder, Macy, Loner, worked out
steadily on the Reserves, throughout

 

thc s icon, and while their work was
consistent, none or them stand our
material.

several other men who will be cli-

as

giblc loi- next year have announced
their intention of getting out lor the
team, Rullitle, Hendrixson, Kinzer,
and McAipin have all had experience
and will give some oi the old men a
run tor the vacancies.

Tile problem ot a coach has not been
deﬁnitely settled. Andrews left tor
his home in the east the night atter
the Cornell victory, tollowed by the
good wishes of the student body at
Grullieil. Although the great majority
here would like to see him again at
the head or the football system, the
matter is still up in the air, and noth-
lng certain is known.

This short review oi our 1909 pros-
pects hardly brings out its iavornble n
iorecast as the dopesters bad odered
ior our 1908 team. But the men lclt
are strong and experienced, and will
make a nucleus tor a team which will
do all that is expected of them, and
represent well the lowa Collage light-
ing spirit.
