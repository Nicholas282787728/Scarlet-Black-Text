HISTORY REI’E \TEII ITSELIX

Cornell s, tirinucll 1—Clostst hcbntc
of (In: Year LOiHCS \’i dry for
UN: Methodists.

Beiore a large and very enthusiastic
audience Grinnell and Cornell taught
to at ﬁlllsli last night on the questioll,!
"Resolved, That the Frttecnth amend-'
ruent was undesirable" Throughout
the entire discussion. two leatures'
were particularly prominent; both
teams had muster-ed every detail oi"
their cases, and both teams met cleare‘
ly and sharply on the some issue,
Gi nnell was superior rn voice and dee‘
livery, Mllle Cornell defeated rrs on
two unonswerablc arguments, nameh r

. tirat "The evils ot‘ negro rule tlid llot‘
-result lrorn the Fifteen amendment,"‘
and “This law was passed to lll‘oLt‘cL‘
negroes against discriliiillation, not
only in the past and at the pi‘esellL‘
tlime, but also in the trrtrrre." As
Kinsley ﬁnished a breathless silcnce‘
fell upon the audience, the results or
the debate being in the balance as'
many of the students alter-ward nce
knowiedgcd the result from the Cor.l
nell standpoint was not at all ccr-tnin.‘

The dcbntc not opened Iiy .ur.

Tlle tor-cc and power which he threw
lnto his delivery marked his speech
as the best at the evening, Kinsley
proved that the Filteentb amendment
had done great harm to the negro, the
south and the nation. The argument
was closed tor the negative by Air.
Strack, rrho proved that the ecrrth
amendment. is a herpelual guarantee
ot the right to vote to all capable no»
grocs. .\li'. Str-aclt was the smoothest
speaker on the negative team.

The r-et'utations were sharp and
quick. the negative constantly attacks
ing the aliirmntivc on the point that
ilipy had but one alter-native. either to
admit the negative case to be no or
to clrttnrpiou universal discrnnintrtion
against the negro race. Tire :tliirma-
tire denied discrimination against the
negro on account oi his race or color
and kept arguing that the Fittecnth
amendment was not llecessaryitllat
the Fourteenth amendment worrld have
completed the work of reconstruction
had its eltect not been nullided hy the
adoption at our last constitutional
amendment,

The debate was consistent and hard
Iouglit. Mi'. Kinsley made the best
rrrtrin speech or the evening and Mr.
zoarwlrunu made the lincst rebuttal

Boardman ol Gl'illllell. lvlio skilliuiir
anti most effectively introduced the
question. arguing that the Filteenth
amendment was a radical measure
which in the heat of strite and the
conﬂict for party supremacy was un-
justly iorced upon the south. Mr.
Bake opened the argument tor Cor»
nell. showing that the purpose or the
hitecnth amendment was to protect
the negro against discrimination and
that the evils of negro i'llle werc pres
eut hetore the adoption or the File
teentn amendment, and consequently
were not a result of that measure.
Mr. Dalte was an eilective debater.
Mr. Hartson continued the argument
tor Grinnell. proving in an rcellemly
prepared and well delivered speech
that the Fourteenth amendment would
have been suiticient to complete the
work ot reconstruction, and that not
only has the Fritecnth amendment
failed to protect the negro against dis-
crirnination but that it has also nulli-
ﬂed the eitect oi the Fourteenth
amendment. Mr. Terr-all continued
the.argument tor Cornell, showing
that the evils commonly contributed to
the Fittecntli amendment were not due
to that measureithnt it did not give
the negro the ballot nor did it pel'petr
rate the evils oi reconstruction. The
debate tor the affirmative was closed
hy’lllr. Kinsley in s masterly manner.
