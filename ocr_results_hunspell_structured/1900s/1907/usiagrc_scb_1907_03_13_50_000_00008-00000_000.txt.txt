ATHLETICS.

Athletics are accepted as a. neces-
sary part of every college student's
life. The IOWECDllege opportunities
to indulge in various sports are given
to men and Women alike and the ad-
vantages gained, in the ease of the
men are self evident. Rut shall the
girls have inter-class contests?" Their
basketball games necessarily [allow
the interrelass and 'varsity games or
the men and for this reason the girls‘
games seem tame anrl uninteresting.
Also the enthusiasm for basketball
has worn thin. The strongest
argumentazaillst open games is that
girls cannot stand the nervousstrain.
But it may be they would be able [0
it they had been properly trainediAu
eﬂicient coach could remedy this
evil. If there was someone to oversee
it, the practices would be regular,
the playing systematic and not so
much energy would be wasted in

superﬂuoustalkiug and noise. They
would work, but not overworkr But
Whether the games are open 01' not,
basketball isa. decided beneﬁt to the
girls themselves and every means pos-
sible should be taken to stimulate
interest in it.

Tennis comes in the spring and in
this Loo, the boys lai- overshadow the
L’il‘ls. This is partly due to the fact
that the girls courts have not been
in good condition and the cup oiiereol
to the boys gives an added test to
their games. However the girls can
play [or the fun 01' [he sport even if
they aren‘t or importance to the rest
of the college.

But athletics are becoming (i more ‘

important factor in the lives of the
youmz women here as is shown by the
Athletic Association organized last
(all. rrliis organization has alreadyo
done elﬁcient work in promoting
hockey and indoor tennis and expects
to do more in the spring, both with
tennis and other outdoor sports.
