One Value or Conventions.

Of late years Grinnell and Iowa
College have heoomc popular as
places Whereat to hold c'uventlors
and conferences. To those concerned
in them these bring a. direct beneﬁt
in the way or help. sympathy and
suggestion Upon the college student
they beam less direct inlluence but
they are not wholly without their
signiﬁcance there.

To some the Ollie! result \\h'ch
appeals is doubtless the release lroin
duty in class room and study hour.
but as much as we all relolce in such
release another fact seems to make
itself 01' preeminent value. One of
the great means oi attaining culture
is knowledge of men. The broadening
01 Vision which comes from knowing
the attitudes (\an principles of indi-
viduals makes it possible for one to
ﬁrmly establish his own beliefs. The
inﬂuence of the men and women
which conferences and,couventions
bring before us is exerted both positive»
ly and negatively, for among their mes-
sages we hear things of which we
approve and others We dissappruvo,
but the Value of the whole stands un-
impaired. From the mere fact that
We know a, man, whoever he is or
whatever he thinks, there comes a
distinct advantage. Ir he can bring
us a helplul message so much the
better.
