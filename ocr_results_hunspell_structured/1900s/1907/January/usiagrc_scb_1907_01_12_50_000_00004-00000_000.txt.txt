' in THE SOCIETIES
(leiiuued lmm First Page.)
View and antlers. vocal soln by Miss
Wilbur, the program was concluded
by lilac Eacllmn with a reading of one
of Beache's humorous Wesoem stories
entitled, “The Pot Hunters."

D. W Wilson and C. A. H.115 were
admitted to membership at the busi-
ness meeting.

Ennis:
_ Ellls was called Worden on Friday
afternoon by Miss Allies, who imme-
diately called to the choir the new
President, Miss Nero Armstrong, ’07,
and put the meeting in her charge
Miss Armstrong gave a. short talk in
which she very graceiully expressed
her intentions in assuming the Dilice
andher hopes for the prosperity of
the society during the opening term.

The remainder of the program was
a unpnnese monologue, given by Miss
Wiley, lei, in costume. it was n very
pretty sketch or a. annnese girl's

, tragedy and was clevelly given.

An enioynnle lecture of the meeting
was the inetthnt the hull had been
newly papered during the Christmas
recess and the ilnor and woodwork
ireshly polished. The lurniture one
other improvements will soon icllow.

THE sew SOCIETY

The iourth literary society ior men
in Iowa College is no longer a matter
oitalhelone, for or permanent organ-

 

nation has been enecteu, omcers
chosen for the winter tern] and one
program already given. The oliicers
tor the winter term are: L. in. Wood-
nzd, Pres; Joseph Brody, Vice Pres:
It. El Arne, Sec; R. A. Lindsey,
Treas; Paul Farrens, Seargellt at-
Arms, and Call Klein, chaplain.

The ﬁrst lirernry meeting was held
Wednesdayerening in the Y. M. c. A
rooms, the permanent. place’ of meetr
ing. Onlyeshort program was giv-
en its considerable time was needed
for business. but the quality of it was
excellent and set a good precedent for
those to follow. Fexler gave a. talk on
“Chrestolnstitute” and summed up
in acomparative statement the virtues
of the two societies and applied the
xesult for the beneﬁt of the new
orgnni etion, Lindsey presented or
vnlnnole discussion of the Japanese

question in Ccliiornin and pleased ,.

his hearers with his able handling or
it. Klein studied the outlook of the
present basket ball season for the
benelit ortlle audience.

The business session was mostly
spent in adopting the Constitution
which provides for the main points
in connection with the society’s ex-
istalice. As yet a home has not been
chosen for the organization but this
handicap Willsoon be overcome and
regular work proceed. Nothing de~
linite has yet been done about organ-
izlng the third girls’ society but steps
will probubly be taken toward it be.
{are long.
