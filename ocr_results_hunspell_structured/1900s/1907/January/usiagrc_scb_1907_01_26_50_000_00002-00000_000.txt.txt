To the stunner and BLALK:

“Chapel cttenders recently heaid a
talk oiavcry unusual kind, in which
debating was classed with coon shows
and card playing, and the opinion was
expressed that it is or less value to
attendmission classes than to read
classic novels. The speakers plea tor
a broad, cultural education was, to a
large extent, good, but his general
attitude was worthy oi philosophic
Athens, not oi Christian Grinnell.
His theory or lite was, apparently—
cultivate yourseli: in this way you
will be most valuable to the world.
But is it not the common experience
oi all oi us that the way to learn is by
doing, that the way to develop a
strong and beautiiul character is not
by caring tor it as one does a house
plant, but by iorcttting it in a love
for service? The Galilean sai : “He
that looseth his liie shall ﬁnd it”.
Could he have meant otherwise than
thatthe true lire isthe one that de-
votes itseli to the enriching of other
lives? The adriceto do more read-
ing and listen to more music may be
well, but the accompanying sentiment
that the primary thing for us to do in
college is to sit at the ieet or our pro-
iessoisandlearn, read the words ot
master minds, and listen to the pro-
ductions or master musicians, and
never neglect them tor the uninport.

tact is thatlor the development of a

familiar with all the classes, he an
appreciater of music, and a master
or the sciences, and still, it 'he never
acts, his lire will count tor nothing.

for it is destructive oi it. True cul-

o. E. Wilder Gives Reasons ior Adopting
Semester Fee—Social Question
Discussed,

Following are some extracts from it
Iletter from A. E. Wilder, ’06, which
seem to bear pertinezttly on the sub-
lect:

“It is true that a large number of
the Students look upon the tuition as
sufﬁciently high at the present time
but on the other hand there is a large
number or those arguing this point
Who are attending Grinnell
scholarships putting them them. Be-
spect always has been shown at Grin-
ucll for the Student who is forced to
”work his way," still I can see little
grounds for arguing such a preposition
as undemocratic. ID is a. means Of giv-
ing to every student What. all desire
at lit/rile sacriﬁce. The studenb pays
his six dollars with the privilege of
receiving in return over twice as much.
Somebody is paying for the rest of “,7
that somebody is everybody.

The most valuable suggestion in
this communication is this:

"Give the sysme a trial. You are
not levying a perpetual tax and if the
system is bad you can discard it.”

Amongother things the following
concerning the semester fee comes
from one of the girls.

It would increase the coed spirit
in the institution The man who could
not dﬁotd entertainment [or two
would he on the same basis as the
man who could and so none need ieol
any embarrassment in asking a woman
ior tier company. This might shock a
man‘s sensibilities at ﬁrst but these
ettects worn on it would be Just like
the class parties. Then the 1110!] who
before had bought tickets ior two
could show his attention in other
waysiihe ielt so inclined. Anyway
lodging from the south halcony at
the last lecture it would be a shame
to vote down the tee on Lilesegmunds

Taking evel'tltiug into consideration
irorn a social view point this lee would
be acceptable as there is no good reas

ways considered that liis privilege)
