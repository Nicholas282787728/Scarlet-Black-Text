SOPHQMORE PICNIC.

Members or igie Have Enjoyable Oui-
ing at Arbor Lake.

The glorious weather of Saturday
- afternoon seemed to have been
'especially planned to meet tile

arrangements of the 1910 social com-
mittee. 'At three o'clock the Sopho-
mores assembled,“ Blair Hall, and
leaving behind the giddy whirl of coir
legeliie, returned to nature on the
cool banks or Arbor Lake.

Aquatic sports occupied most
of the afternoon, while those who did
not care for rowing spent the time
very informally on the club house
verandas Some star performers were
discovered in a gameoi leap frog.

Aserles of fast and exciting boat
races was onset the features of the
day. Three crews entered the men’s
race, the winning boat having for its
crew, Harold Gardner, John Board-
man, and Carl Klein. The girl’s race
was then pulled off. The winning
boat was occupied by Winnie Smith,
FlorenceOrr and Beatrice Daytoul
The ﬁnal contest between the winning
crews was fast and close, but. the girls
ﬁnally proved themselves superior
by ﬁnishing almost a length
ahead. '

Lunches were handed out at; the
club house lunch counter by the mem-
bers oi the social committee. After
supper a huge bonﬁre was lighted,
about which the class gathered to
unite in singing songs and giving yells
until the party broke up to return
once more to strenuous living.

Miss Gardner and Miss Lowden
were faculty guests of the class. The
committee in charge was as follows:

Frederick Murphy, Murray Mc
Murray, Charles Holmes. Clih‘ord
Wells, Chester Davis. William Zelgler,
Louise Hugus, Barbara Cornwall,

Ethel Steinhilber, Rachel Williams,

Florence Nadler, and Mabel Clark.

HUMBOLDT SOCIETY,
Professor F. F. Almy read‘ a. paper
last evening before the faculty un
“What equipment is necessary for
the successful teaching of science in
secondary schools." He ﬁrst gave
’ some interesting notes on the meeting
of the National Educational Associa—
tion at Los Angeles last July. The
total enrollment of the Association
is over 10,000, The society wasrecent-
ly reorganized under the provisions of
a. special enabling act of Congress. At
the last meetingthe Board ofTrusteos
voted down the simpliﬁed spelling
proposition while the Association at
large voted for the measure. The re-
marks of Professor Almy were based
on a paper he read last summer at Los
Angcles. The ﬁrst requirment is a
teacher, resourceful and tactful, skill-
ed in the use or scientiﬁc equipment
and above all a. man who his physicist
miller than a pedagogisr. The second
necessity is good equipment ior dem-
onstration. It should be simple. well
made and orsuch :loish asto command
the respect or the pupil. The appa-
ratus must be consistent in its work-
ings and be plentiful enough that class
labrctory work can supplement the
class room lecture.

DOLLAR VALUE OF ATHLETICS.

A serious problem confronts the
trustees of Swarthmore College. By
‘tho terms of the will of Miss Annzt T.

Jeanes of Philadelphia the institution
is to receive “coal lands worth about
$3,000,000,” provided the institution
"would at once drop all athletics.”
it is presumed of course, this refers to
intercollegiate contests, as it is not
supposed that Miss Jeanes, while a
Peaceful Quakerrss, would have object-
ed to athletic exercises among the
young Friends at. college.

President Swain expresses the belief
that the trustees will not accept the
bequest with the accompanying pro~
vision. He points out, what is already
known in the student world. that ath-
letics have been a strong and attrac-
tive feature of college lile at Swarth-
more, and that the strength or the
various teams, which have command-
ed the respect and fear of many of the
larger institutions, has shown how
general is the athletic spirit. He de-
plo’res a step} which would.injure the
college in the esteem and love of the
undergraduates and plainly conveys
his iear that compliano: with the
terms ol the will would be fatal to the
interests oi‘the institution.

For the world outside this is an in-
teresting situation. For the ﬁrst time
the commercial value of athletics is to
be tested. And, fortunately, Swarth-
lnorc is an ideal institution {or a satisr
iaotory test Here is a college with
ao'instrucrors and 30-. students deeply
interested in athletic sports and unus-
ually successful in intercollegiate com-
petitions. To an institution so small
comparatively the sum of $3,000,000 is
an extraordinary legacy. With ordi-
nary care the money could be invested
in a manner that would give the col-
lege unusual equipment and put it
above the need of further anxiety
But evidently the question is, what. is
the use ofa perfectly equipped insti-
tution of instruction if it ceases to at-
tract students? To what. extent are
young men drawn to Swarthmore by
its attention to and success in ath-
letlcs and in what degree‘would the
embargo on athletics airect its pros-
perity and future attendance?

The general question is, can any in»
stitution give up athletics for any
stipulated sum? And what is, propor-
tionately, the commercial value? It
$3,000,000 will not. tempt Swal-thmore
with 300 students. would $32,000,000
have any (treat an Yale with 3,200
5 t u d e n r s‘.’ Unfortunately, as Miss
homes is no longer interested in mun-
dane aiiairs, she cannot raise hammer,
but whatever the result or the pres-
ent discussion we shall get some fur-
ther light on the importance of college
athletic sports as Lhe requisite means
to a college tdul‘arion and asan induce
me'nt equal if not superior to climate,
