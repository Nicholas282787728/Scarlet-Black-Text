Talk Glee Club at Home,

A short time since Manager limir.
lass gave an invitation for any who
deslled to have the Glee Club come to
their home towns next season to con-
rer with him about it, In a short
time many will lie at home and arter a
couple or months all will have plenty

One way is to help the Glee Club get a
date there and though all towns can-
not have them in one season the
manager Will be very glad to tour
with everyone about it.
