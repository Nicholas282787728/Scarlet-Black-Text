Once a year the SCARLET
BLACK furnishes t0 the women of
Iowa College an opportunity to pre-
sent conditions and discuss the burn-
ing questions of the day. irom a
woman’s standpoint. The purpose or
this issue, then, is primarily to give
the women a chance to “say their
say" as they please. We do not mean
to insinuate that they do not do this
at various other times and places, but
in this issue they do it ulliclally and
in so doing, they hope that their
opinions, thus ireely expressed, may
carry some weight. Most of the
questions treated in the editorials are
those that. allect the college as a
Whole and not the women alone: but
are, nevertheless olspecial importance
to us. it; any or them seem ex~
aggerated or one-sided, please consid~
er them carefully and We believe you

Iowa College ought by Lllls tune to be
well accustomed to this illclliud oi I'Er

iuncticns, ior lL is certainly prevalent
enough Yer somehow (here is some~
(him; about most girls which causes
them") shrink from having such a
request hurled alter them between
classes, or preferred at any chance
meeting in the halls or on the campus.

The custom oi assigning names

makes it impossible {or a girl to treat
such impoliteness with the refusal it
deserves. Her only other alternative
is to slay at home and lose her the
lsliare or riie evening‘s enjoy-moot.

If any gentleman rel: es the name
olali'dy whom he is to escort to a
party. It is not only showing a lack cl
respect for the gill. but indicating
awant oi proper-self respect and re-
gard iornoiireness, ilile rails to call
upon the lady in question to invite
her to accompany him. Tile dis-
courtesy is not ‘d. reﬂection upon her,
but upon himseil. lie has onlylulver-
ed himself [mm the s t a n d a rd of
politeness ni‘ a college man.

Furthermore, it is at the leasmmst
discolirreous to deier asking the lady
until the day helore or the (lay of the
party. it is all too frequent an occur-
rence that many girls do not know
whether they have an escort assigned
them until in is too late to plan to go
Without great inconvenience to them-
selves. "I couldn’t, ﬁnd time,” Is a
poor excuse. one should take time to
be police.

A third complaint which injustilied
by circumstances is against the fashion
of “swapping names.” It usually
happens that the girls in question
are quite Well aware oi the “trade"
and the discomfort attending the
knowledge has spoiled an evening’s
enloymentroragood many girls. The
men who so carelessly "trade names"
would take it as a mortal insult ii rhe
girls should say tiiey really prelerrrd
to go with some one else and had
made arrangements to “swap men.”

In such social arrangements the
girls are expected to do the proper
thing, accept without complaining
any escort provided, and besweet and
gracious and polite. It seems the
boys are not. Why not?

There is a great amount or dis
cussion these «lai s. oiiicial and other.

student activities, being steadily in»
creased every year: and the question
is'oiteii raised,——Ii We have too many
oi these interests apart irorn class
room work, which or them could be
mosteasiiy dispensed with"

We are not prepared to admit that
too many such "outside interests". as
they are styled, have sprung upinour
midst. Eachtllinlz is a natural out
growth and has its own place to iill.

Under ourpresent'sistem this is no.

chosen [mm the Junior class and told
to get out a book, new in idea,

year more ambitious and elaborate.

Tliel'ifoi'e if these other books rely'
onhDards of twenty, thirty or even
more, itls easy to see the burden of
our more diillcnlt task when intrusL-
ed to thirteen.

The working of this plan might: be
made very simple. The {principal
parts or every Annual, the Faculty,
class, athletic, Humor departments
and others are always to be provided
for. Let the Board be chosen as the
heads of these various departments,
collectively working with a i‘reSI-

and the plain ol each department, yet
each having Sub'eﬁllbors who would do
the bulk of the actual work ol the (le~

this way, and even the original feat-

is the reason some have not felt the

We have heard it said “It isthe

Tllisis true in more cases than one.
