DR STEINER MAKES EASTERN
TRIP.

Will Deliver Lecture on immigration
Problem in Many Eastern Cities.

On Friday evening Doctor E. A.
Steinerleit lot the National Council
of the Congregationalchurches, which
is being held in Cleveland, 0., where
he is to make two addresses. This is
the beginning ora long trip through
the cost, which Dr. Steiner is under-
taking in behali orthe Congregational
Home Missionary and Educational
Society, Practically every large city
is visited and nearly every evening
there is an address scheduled. The
work is a great sacrilice on the part or
Dr. Steiner and the college, because
there is absolutely no ﬁnancial remun-
eration in it and the work necessarily
causes a loss to the college in the time
which can be given to Dr. Steiner’s
work. The object or the trip is to
study the condition ofthe immigrants
inspecial communities and to speak
to the churches upon the Problems or
Immigration. T h e congregational
Board oriererl Dr. Steiner apermanent
position in which he could carry ou
’tllisstudy and work and the present
trip is a compromise which he altered
as a substitute since he would not
leave the college. Similar oiIel's were
made to Dr. Steiner by the Presbyter-
ian Board and by the Y. M. c. A. in
the state of Pennsylvania. Both of
these ooers were reiused by Dr. Stein-
air, but he will undertake two more
trips east during the winter, one trip
in the interest or each oithese organl.
zations. It was largely because or
these, and similar propositions which
have been made to Dr. Steiner, which
led to his organization or the course
in Immigration which is being given
‘ln Iowa College at present. This
course is the only one oiits kind which
is being given at any college or Uni~
versity in the Unitedstates; and could
be given in no other school because
the men who are capable or teaching

such acourse are very few. The ob-
ject of this course is to acquaint Stu-
dents with the history and the con
ditions of the Immigrants in their
home lands, and their needs in this
country so that we can better appre-
ciate and understand the problems of
Immigration.

Thu present itinerary of Dr. Steiner

R, R. Rust wishes to apologize to
the student body for the rake telegram
putupin his window regarding the
meet at; Kansas City a week ago. Thu
message was handed him as correct

 

and he was not aware of its veracity.

CHAPEL TALK.

President Main spoke at chapel Irrir
day morning upon what seemed to him
the most important event which has
happened thus rar in the year oi 1907.
Last January the President spoke in
chapel 01 what seemed to him as the
greatest event icr the year oi 1900. At
that time he dwelt upon the move-
ment toward disarmament and inter-
nttionalpeace as being the greatest
thing enrolled in the year’s history
In his tall; Friday he upheld the some
thesis for the ﬁrst llali of rim?

or course alldo not agree as to what
the most important event or a year is,
but it is interesting to note the ten
dency oi the various’events which di~
verse leaders or public opinion have
chosen as seeming to them the most
important happening of the year. At
the close or the year or loco Dr. Ed
ward Everett Hale sent out to various
leaders of public thought ror their
opinion as to the greatesteveut or the
year. The answers returned included
most every prominent event or the
year il'Dnl the securing or Woman's
Suirrage in Finland to the downhill or
autocratic government in Russia and
the beginning oi the regeneration or
China. In not one or these answers
was the movement toward interna-
tional peace mentioned, but through
them all can be seen the tendency
working toward that millennial goal.

Through modern inventions time
and space are being annihilated and
with modern commercial intercourse
the world is becoming smaller and
more compacted. And with the di-
vision or labor every man is dependent
upon every other man. Men Can’t ai-
iord to go to war. They lose more
than they win. Then too in our twen-
tietli century lire men are thinking
individuals and are not to be arbitl‘ar»
iiy moved about in chess board rash
ion as they were‘oi old.

The times point toward peace and

tho the shprtsighted man may soon
at the apparent {allure oi the Peace
Conrerenco to attain immediate re-
sults, the thinking man should ap—
preciate the signiﬁcance oi events,

and should be able to read ariglit the
signs or the times. Many adjustments
whine necessary to bring the diverse
interests or the world under a univer-
sal rule or peace but it will come be
cause it is right. The college man
should be in line with this greatest
or modern movements and be ready

to help push it along

HUMEOLDT SOCIETY.

The Humboldt society will meet at
seven o’clock next Tuesday evening in
Room a or the Library. Proiessor
Almy will make the address. an

PROFESSOR STEINER LESTURES
ON IMMIGRATION.

Lash evening in the chemical lec-
ture room, Proiessor Steiner gave an
illustrated talk of one llour's length
on the races or Southern Europe, par-
ticularly on those peoples who are
thronging in large numbers to our
shores at the present day. A iew years
ago Mr. Steiner made a trip over the
regions or the Slavic and Russian
people and with a irodalr secured many
of the views that ho displayed last
evening.

The people were shown in their
native dress which among those living
in the mountain regions is very costly
and gorgeous, but among the slavs
particularly this native dress is aban-
doned for American customs as soon
as they land in this country. A tow
views were given or some or the old
architectural remains in southern
Europe and the utter disregard which
the people have today for these mag~
nilicanti remains. The most interest-
ing views were or the giants oi Monte»
negro who are the best ﬁghters in the
world and the strongest and the brav-
estoi any tribe in Europe but who
when they come to America. are em-
ployed chieilyin the mining regions
of Pennsylvania. The lecture was in-
tensely interesting throughout and ‘
was listened to by the class and many
visitors. '
