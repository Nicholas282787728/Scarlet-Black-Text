Friday afternoon the Giiiinell bases
ball team cincheti the state champion-
shin title, decisively “alloping Drake
by the score of 370. The play was for
the nlusL part rugged and slow, with
only ﬂashes oi good baseball to mark
it as fl championship game

moment later on a Wild pitch by MC;
Coy. In the fourth, Smithson was
passed to ﬁrst and adVéliICed and scor-
ed on “lid base throwing and errors
on Drake‘s part. Tile last run, the
only earned rim of the game, came as
8‘ result of ii twobase hit by Wall
ncr, and a smashing single by Barber,
which scored the runner.

Drake played poorer hall than was
expected, judging from their past
work. A total of six "bungles." some
of which aided materially in the scor-
ing, were marked on against the blue
and White. Smilhson and MCCOY, the
opposing sollthllaws, allowed four hits
each. Smithson Struck out seven, MCv
Coy six.

Good base running on the whole was
Conspicuous by its absence throughout
the game. Men were caught stealing
second, and caught on bases, as though
the contest were not at all important.
