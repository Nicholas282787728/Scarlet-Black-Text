INTERVIEWER. _

President Main said to one at the
Scarlet and Black reporters the other
day “I (lo wisli something could he
said riliout passing out at morning
Clidllel which would have same errect

or the room. or course it is n udtt zil‘

“In spite 01 all iirguiiiciits against
the Sunday Tradition," said arSenior
girl, “I still believe it is a good thing
to observe. Every girl in the Collegel
ought to bore one evening to licrseli.
unit this time comes most naturally on
Sunday evening. it is always argued
tliut the girls are allowed to have coin-
pnuy when at home, and why not here?
nut conditions here are very ditlerent.
Suppose a house oi ten girls, all have
company Sunday evening. it makes
out or this day a regular gala time,
and thus it loses itssncrcdness, arid

the rcst hiricli it should bring, is lost "

Regarding the social lirc oi the men
and women oi oriiiiicll College, Miss
Slicrdou, iormcr Donn Ol Women, said
“I wish that there was not such a pier
dominance ot women in Grinncll Col-
legc. 1 think there would he an im-
provement iii the manner-sot the men
it things were evened up a little. They
get into the habit oi putting too high a
premium on their attentions, and it
is hdrmtnl to them, ior they become
careless about little liiiigs, such as our
enin’g doors and allowing he girls to
pass out rust. or course the girls ciin
get along just as well without having
these things done for them, but it is

“I believe in the Semester Fee, said

a prominent Junior girl, "it makes
the girls or the College more indepellll'

lots of people, boys and girls both, who

Such a collection would grow stcnd-

possible to make it; old («\(letl photo-
