VOLUME XVII, NUMBER 23

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1909.

In view of the criticism that has
been directed against football, we have
asked Coach Daugherty to make a
statement froin the standpoint of one

who thoroughly believes in the game.#

FOOTBALL AS A COLLEGE SPORT

“Sad is the man who dies with all
his music in him."

So also is the man’s life a sad one
who has never stood in position on the
field of a big game aliaitillg the kick.
off. Nothing in life has given me more
pleasure and satisfaction than to think
of a play 1 made one day which put
my name on the book or fame in a lit-
tle college in Western Pennsylvania.
I dare say the same is trite of every
man who has played the game for the
pure love of the sport.

Football, contrary to the decision of
some very eminent critics, is not brw
tnl "per se." it is foolish to place the
blame wholly on the game because
some particular individual deliberate
ly and maliciously intends, and quite
often succeeds in “putting out" an op.
ponont.

The game itself is not one dcpend-
ing upon brute force as is often said.
but a game which requires brains,
sharp wit, speed and agility of body,
and a world of determination.

Ta memorize one hundred or nioic
different signals, each of ivliioh is a
separate and distinct play, and each
play requ' ing a ceitain partici
thing for every player to do in a si on
way, requires the host of a thinking
hrai . A player in “hitting the liue‘
at different spots does not always do
so in the same way, but hc iniist adapt
himself to the position he is iittcnipt
ing to get through or ill'ounil. ilc docs
not kick the ball the same when punt-
ing as he does when drop ' ' r, nor
the same in place kicking as in either
of the other two. in making tin-ward
passes he does not always pass the hall
in the same way. He does not alw vs
handle himself the sonic when attempt.
lug to break interference or taclde the
man who is car , ig the ball.

All of these things enumerated re-
quire quick thinking and ectcli time it
is on the spur of the moment, for he
must adapt himself in an instant to
the circumstances as they rciilly arc
and not as they should he, for the
circumstances are cldoin ever just the
same as they ever 4 re before.

or course the game is not as tanin as
ping pong, but is rather a strenuous
sport and brings out the best that is

To the uninitiated spectator all that
appears is a mass of men piled in a

other; hur. to the old player who has

served his time doing the same thing.
there is a thrill of intense pleasure as
he watches a clean tackle. a long onii.
