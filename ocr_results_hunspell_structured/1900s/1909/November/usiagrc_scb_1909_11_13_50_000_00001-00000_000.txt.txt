Another deieat came to the Soar-let

hell was rorced to how to the team
from the State Normal with a score o
24 to 6. The visitors outplayed their
opponents, making their gains chiefly
on plays around the ends, irhile the
main cause for the defeat arose from
the poor tackling of the Griunell team.
Grinnell's touchdown, in the latter part
of the second half, came when Grin-
nell obtained the hall on a tumble on
Normals 11 yard line. Ziegler in two
smashes carried the hall to within one
yard of the line, irhere Normal held
for two downs with no gains. Ziegler
was then pushed over for a touchdown
and Wells, a moment later, kicked goal.

Notes.

Hammond's piloting was one or the
remedying features of Gl'lllneli's play:

Normal made nlost of their gains on
end runs,

miner and hlegger both advanced
with great success for the teachers,

Wells and Clark both went down one

dei- their punts while tackling theirl

men with certainty,

Grinnell seemed to he unable to get
away on any of the formations used.

Ziegler as usual did most oi the
ground gaining for the Scarlet and
Black.

This makes a successful season for
Normal, having won all the seven
games scheduled.

The support given by the student
body was ROTTEN. The few rooters
out did the best they could, but their
work was far short of.Grinnell siih.
borters of other years.

A united Grinnell can win the Cor-
neil contest.

Cornell has never defeated Grinneil.

(By Professor Thomson.)
Wednesday evening at the Colonial.
(lruinell had a fourth opportunity to
enjoy Donald Robertson and his play.
The

el‘s, Si or Robertson, ll'llo ior

dramas of high literary value, by Eur-
,opcaii and American authors, with un,

usually thoughtful and careiuily find
lislleil acting, are welcomed with much
pleasure. Remembering the excellent
productions of Milton‘s “Collins," and
‘ot Goliloui's “A Curious Mishap," oi
last season, and Isben's "John Dol'li—
lmnn,” a good audience awaited with
enthusiastic expectancy the dramatic
offering of last Wednesday evening.
We were given the rare opportunity
of enjoying a drama by an author in
whose work we, as Iowans, are ’pnrtio
niariy interested.

“The Art of Life,“ a madern society
drama in three acts, was written by
Professor Lewis Worthington Smith oi
Drake University. It is a thoroughly
delightful comedy, so sui'lused with
delicate humor throughout, that the
problem element never becomes heavy
or oppressive, It has an extraordinary
amount of crisp, eplgrdmmatic din-
logue

Philip Lnligllliii and his wile, aiier
[twenty years of sir ggle to get so rich
that they may give themselves over to
a life of leisure, have at last got thus
far, thanks to Texas oil. llcre the
trouble seems to begin. Philip wishes
to settle down to a quiet lire, clil’ovlnt:
”poetry, painting. and line in ’

OlIYL‘TZM'd’A Pool and
Philosopher.

inasmuch as last Wednesday has the
one hundred fiftieth anniversary of
the birth or Schiller, Fridoy chapel
was devoted to commemorating the
event. Professor Pe ing led the ser»
vices and read a. good paper all the
character and doctrines of Schiller. in
introducing his subject, he hrought
out the inct that, of all the great Ger-
man poets, Schiller was the most unis
versally beloved and revered by the
German people. He called Goethe "a
Greek with a German accent," Scllilr
ler was closer to the hearts of his
countrymen, who called him “unser
Schiller."

Two particular pains in the beliefs
of Schiller were mentioned as leading
features of his work. First, he was
an advocate of liberty, and, second, he
was an apostle of the periect life. He
had iii-m convictions and never iosi
sight of them in his ii itings. "lie
was a philosopher as well as a poet,‘
said Mr, Fe mg, ”and the poet never
went out or ir pering distance of the
philosopher."

Sclllller's iniliience in promoting the
spirit of liberty among the Germans
and throughout the world was dwoll
upon, Also his ideas of the meaning
and purposes oi life were outlined in a
keen mid thorough way, Schiller was
presented not only as a poet, but as a
gi at man, who had high and enuoln
ling ideals and was iii-m and true in
giving them to the world.

ody in mu , miles the various num
bers were such that their conception
and beauty could be grasped nlore or
less readily. Appreciation was also
heightened by the familiarity of the
audience with most of the composie
tions.

The program opened with a double
Giiiiniant number: two movements
from the First Sonata, and his “Lam.
entation." The latter was precisely
yet delicately handled,

The second number was a beautiful
little song by Elgar, “Saint d'Amour,”
the third number, a vividly colored
hhapsodie by St. Saens, based upon
Breton melodies, and the ioiirtli num.
