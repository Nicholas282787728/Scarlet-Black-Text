“The

« mi mm:
reporter, “has pcon icmhr Ible since
discussion on thc suhjeor was started.

we nic conﬁdent Llizli. in a short lime

“Another encouraging point is that
cases or hooks being taken irom the
stack rooms without being charged at
the desk are becoming less and less
frequent. There is still some of this
going on, but not nearly to the extent
as last year.

“There is one thing, howevcr, which
is bcing neglected. and that is in re,
gard to replacing books on the shelves
after looking at them. It would he a
great help to the library force if the
students would follow the instructions
placed conspicuously on the shelves.
Even if one is sure they know just
where the hook belongs, we uould pro
fer [a have Llle hook either placed on
edge of the shelf or else lclt on the
table A little more cooperation in the
matter will be a great help in keeping
the book arrangement perfect.”

In spite or the fact that oi late the
“fortunes or war have onl} ‘t defeat
to Grinnoll,” remarked on optomisticc
senior. "I still believe that We will
win the Cornell game. Everyone has
a happy feeling that by some happy
chance we shall be victorious. But we
all admit that. if we ever needed the
help of our guardian angel we shall
need ii. a week from Saturday. I be.
lieve that the Grinncll spirit will be
put to n great test. It is up to the
students to see that it is not found
wanting."
