Ward Field,

The long contemplated
provernent in \Vard Field. which
will be accomplished in the near
future. is, we hope, only emblem-
atic of the good times coming.
both administrative and material.
under the new regime of athletic
control. Our athletic park has
long been poorly adapted to the
purposes tor which it was de-
signed. The situation of the dia
mond compels the baseball men
to run back and forth over the
track in chasing fouls or in cover
ing their position in the outﬁeld.
The track is totally inadequate to
accomodate our dual meets with
S. U: I., or even the spring home
meets. It has been necessary to
use the fair grounds for those pure
poses at considerable expense, not
to mention the inconvenient dis-
lance to the grounds. The Board
of Athletic ‘Control proposed to
remedy this evil at once, and, with
commendable promptness, have
already maturcd plans which only
await execution.

The track will be onerthird of a
mile in length and will lie in the
general direction of southwest to
northeast. It will be sufﬁciently
banked at the ends to enable the
fastest sprinting and bicycle rid-
ing, and will be wide enough to
accomodate any number of men
likely to enter our meets for some
time to come. The 220-yard
course will be. a straight-away.
This is an admirable feature of the
plan, as a straightaway oders the
best conceivable conditions for
both fair and fast racing. The
gridiron and diamond will be ins
side of the track, but as the track
is to be a thirdrmile one, the pres-
ent difﬁculties will not be exper»
ienced. The grand stand will
probably occupy a position some~

imr

 

where near the entrance gate and
at the ﬁnish of the220-yard course.
The position will be the one most
advantageous to the spectators
forwalching cithcr track, diamond
or gridiron.

Track.

Now that a week and a half of
college work, track work and foot»
ball have gone by. it will be a mat
ter of interest to see what has been
transpiring upon the track in that
short time.

The old saying, “You must be a
beginner to become a champion,”
seems to be instilled into a great
many, forthe number of new men
is remarkable and very gratifying,
and better yet they are all work.
ing With a will and determination.
The old members of the teams of
the past two years seem more in-
terested this fall and are bound to
derive wonders of good, for the
fall work strengthens a man so
that when springcomcshc isrcady
to begin hard work Without so
great an amount at preliminary
work. Twentyrsix men reported
for work VVednesdzly. This is a
large number for tall. but on Mon»
day more men are expected as
the tall meet is but two weeks oft
and the entries must be in by next
Thursday. The fall meet is a
handicap meet. and all men will
be handicapped iairly and im-
partially, every contestant having
an equal chance,

Glee Club.

At the glee club examination
last evening some excellentvoices
presented themselves, and this
morning at eleven o‘clock the ex.
amination was continued. As
there are an unusual number of
vacancies. ten in all, caused by
graduations and nonrreturn ol last
year’s members, it is very desir-
able that a ﬁnal choice be made
from all the good voices in college.
Tenors are especially needed. To
give everyone an opportunity to
try for a place, another examina-
tion will take place in Prof. Cole’s
room Tuesday evening at seven
o’clock.
