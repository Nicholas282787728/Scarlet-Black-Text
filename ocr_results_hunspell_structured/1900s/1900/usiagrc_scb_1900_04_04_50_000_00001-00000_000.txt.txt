Chrestomathians and Philoma-
thians Tie in the Joint
Debate.

The Inter-society debate, held
inthe congregational church on

Saturday evening between the
Philomathian society of the State
University and thc Chrestomathir
an society oi Iowa college, ter-
minated somewhat unsatisfactori-
ly to both parties. in a tie. Judge
Scott oi Brooklyn, who had been
secured as a judge, was unable to
come; the gentleman who was to
have acted as his substitute also
failed to appear, and as the two
remainingjudges, Mr, R. H. Hole
brook oi Cedar Rapids and Judge
Z. A. Church ofjefferson, decided
on opposite sides oi the~question,
the result of the debate must be
ieit to public opinion, which will
doubtless render no more satisfac-
tory decision than the judges were
able to furnish. Here at Grinnell
we are inclined to give ourselves
credit tor the victory, but we are
willing to accord our Iowa City
friends the same privilege, in view
ot the fact that the debate was
one oithe most stubbornly-iought
contests ever held in Grinnell.
The size of the audience is the
only ieature oi the debate open
to criticism. It was not commen-
surate with the excellence of the
debate, nor was it an adequate
recognition onthe part oi the stur
dents of the commendable desire
shown by the Chrestornathian so-

 

ciety to arouse interest in debating
in Iowa College.

Prof. Parker, as presiding oﬂicr
er, introduced the ﬁrst number on
the program, a cor-net duet by
Messrs. Deiavan and Way, which
was well received. Following
this came the debate on the ques-
tion, ”Resolved, that the English
claims in the controversy with the
South African Republic, prior to
January i, iooo, are justiﬁable,"
The Chrestomathinn society sup.
ported the afﬁrmative, the Philo-
mathian, the negative side of the
question.

Mr. McCarty, the ﬁrst speaker
on the afﬁrmative, stated that
the afﬁrmative was ' not called
upon to justify the English policy
and conduct of the war, but mere-
ly the English claims. He out»
lined two main lines of argument.
namely, that an unbearable coudir
tion of affairs existed in the South
Air-ican Republic, which demand»
ed a remedy and that England
was justiﬁed in interiering in or-
der to secure a remedy, and un-
dertook to prove the ﬁrst point
by a suivey oi the condition oi
the Outlanders, calling special at
tention to the fact that they were
entirely without citizenship and
hence without means ot redress
save by appeal to their sovereign
power, which was England.

Mr. W. H. Reed opened the
argument for the negative with a
statement that the question must
be debated irom a legal, and not
from a sympathetic, standpointi
The South Airican Republic may
have made mistakes, but they are
not oi a quality or number to war-
rant English intcrierence. With
the convention of I384, England
relinquished all suzerainty over
the Boers. reserving only the
powcroiveto overioreigntreaties.
By theJameson raid of i895, Eng
land broke her side of the com~
pact and gave the Boers the right
to resist. The Jameson raid was
an attempt, prompted solely by
desire ior aggi-andizernent and
connived at by the British gov.
ernment. to annex the South Air
rican Republic. The present
situation is the result o[ a similar
plot.

Mr. H. S. Dickinson, in behalf
of the afﬁrmative, denied that the
Jameson raid was planned by the

 

English authoiities, calling to wit»
ness the attempts made by Mr.
Chamberlain to stop it. Follow-
ing the general outline of the air
ﬁrinative, he attempted to prove
that the interference of England
wasjiistiﬁed for two reasons: ﬁrst,
because the conventions \vei'eibro-
ken, second, because oi her rights
under international law to protect
her citizens. In proof ot the ﬁrst
point he stated that the Boers had
become English subjects both by
occupation and purchase. and that
England had never relinquished
her suzerainty over them. In the
articles of I884, the ivord suzerain~
ty is stricken out. but the sub
stance deﬁning England's suzer-
ainly over the Transvaal remains.
To prove his second point he
stated that the Boers had three
times before broken their part of
the agreement, and by every prin-
ciple of international law England
is no longer bound by the contract.

Tire argument for the negative
was taken up by Mr. F. M. Baker,
who stated in rebuttal of previous
arguments, that the Jameson raid
was recalled by Mr. Chamberlain
because it was premature, and that
the Jameson raid mtist not be iden-
tiﬁed with tlieJameson plan. He
reiterated the claim that England
had relinquished suzcrainty over
the Boers in 1884. England's at-
titude is shown by the fact that
she refused arbitration; and the
Boer response to the English
claims was so prompt and ready
that all necessity for English ins
terference was obviated.

The last speaker tor the afﬁrm»
ative. Mr. C. E. Qiiaiie, challenged
the authority of the negative for
their statements with reference to
the Jameson raid, claiming that
their only authority came irom
newspaper writers and conﬁdants
oiMr.Chamberlain. l—Ierepeated
the statement that England was
not responsible iorthe Jameson
raid and showed that England's
claims were as valid six or eight
years before the raid as they were
after it. He then took up the point
that England’s interference was
justiﬁable through her rights as a

paramount power. Her title to
paramountcy rests on conquest,
occupation and purchase, and she
is responsible ior peaec botll in~
ternally and externally.
