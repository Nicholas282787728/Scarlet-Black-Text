lovers of lnllsic. Mr.
Clark is probably as good a bal'ir
tone as lhcre is in the country [Or
day. He has been favorably res
ccivcd in Eulope. and is now in
his prime. With him, by special
arrangement, will bc Miss Mary
Wood Chase. a pianist ot superior
ability and tlaining. Mr. L
Glover in the Chicago TimcsAHcrr
ald says ot hel. “Her toxic is ﬁrm
and extremely musical, and her
technical skill is cqual to any
i'easonabledemands. Thcstrictly
ornamental passagcs made no
draft upon brilliancy ot cxccution
that sh: could not readily honor,
and her renderings wcrc entirely
sympathetic."

Glenn Hall, who comes Feb is,
is one of the best and most
promising of the younger tenors.
His appenrancein Des Moincs last
spring created a good deal oi cn-
thusiasm, Mrs. Beecher, who
comes with him, is a rcadcr whose
equal isscldom heard, it hearty cn-
dorscmcnts from such public
speakers as Col. Bain, J. 13. De
Matte, and Hon. ]. P. Dollivcr ac»
count for anything. Dr. Charles
F. Aked of Liverpool, whose visit
to Grinnell a few years ago will be
rcrnsmbcrcd by many, has paid
her the following tribute: “I have
heard nothing on either side of the
Atlantic so perfect as your read-
ing, You have bctorc you a great
career and an international repu-
tation. You have genius, and
gcnius ot the highest order. It is
impossible not to cnvy you thc
possession of such a voice.” With
these two will be Mr. G. W. Kiirtz,
an organist and accompanist.

The last speakcr on the list,
Prof.Ricllard liurton,occupiesthe
chair of English Literature in the
University of Minnesota. Dr.
Burton is very popular with the

treat for

 

pcoplc oi Minneapolis. and is in
great demand with them for pub~
llc lectures and addresses. He is
spoken of as a humorist ot lha
highest typc. He is the author of
a volumc of critical litcrary cssays
cntitlcd “Literary Likings." and a
volume of poems entitled "Lyrics
of Brotherhood." He also con
tributes to Charles Dudley Warr
ner’s Library otthc World's best
Literature three of the clitical

B. essays; those on Alnlel, Heinrich

Hcillc, and Sidney Lanier. Dr.
Burton has a large numbcr ot
lectures which he announces. the
one chosen to bc givcn harc being,
“Literature as art and personalir
ty."

The Game To-day,

To-day Grinnell meets the
University of Wisconsin on the
gridiron at Madison. The out»
come of the game as far as con»
cerns the score is in little doubt.

Grinnell has played two hard
games thus lar in the season
and has shown some indication of
her probable strength. \Nltcrcas
Wisconsin will not play licr ﬁrst
big gamc until Nov. 3, when she
mccts Chicago. The most that
can be hoped for is that the Glin-
nell team will give Wisconsin a
good stiff practice game.

Junlor~Freshman Basketball.

The ﬁrst match game otthc sea-
son, played last Wednesday. did
credit to thc players as it was one
of the best games ever played
hero. The Jliniors' playing was
even and strong throughout, and
showed what regular team prac-
tice will do. ’04 is to be commend—
ed for the progress made in the
First year. Individually they play
well but lack system in team work.

The interest shown in basket
ball this fall is good. Each class
supported its team well from the
gallery, and many visitors wcrc
present. For scvcral years has
ketball has bccn a comparatively
weak factor of athletics in Iowa
College. This should not be. Now
that the interest has revived a lit.
tlc. evcry girl should feel respon-
sible for the team other class and
support it in every way.
