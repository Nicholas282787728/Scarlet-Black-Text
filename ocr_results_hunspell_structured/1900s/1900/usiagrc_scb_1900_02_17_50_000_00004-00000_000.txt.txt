Owing to the numerous social
events on Saturday, the socrety
nret on Wednesday evening this
week. The change in the time of
meeting l'iltllcr hampered several
of the members, but the program
as lellclel'ct‘l was very creditable.
The music of the evening was ese
pocitrlly good. Miss Brolt'nell
sang a solo that was so greatly
appreciated that she responded to
alrenrty encore. MissTllonlpson
gilve n piano solo in her usual
plcrlilllg lnztnncr, but could not be
prevailed upon to give another ser
Iccllon.

The life and services of Wash»
ington was the subject of the reg
tllar program and it brought ont
very forcibly the true worth at
the greatest of American states
men.

The ﬁrst number was "Washing
ton as a Soldier" by Arnold. He
traced the early military career of
Washington, showing its bearing
on tire Revolution and the success
ol the American colonles. Muller
described Washington as a citi
zen, (lcaling especially with his
simple life on his estate at Mount
Vernon and his relation wrllr the

sll'ong character of the man Vety
otterr exercised an inﬂuence upon
the history btAmerica. The pure
ity and simplicity of Washington’s
tarnily relations was ably present
ed by McMartin in a paper on
“Washington’s Private Life.” In
the extenrporancous work. B|0d~
getl spoke on "Washington's In-
nuence on my Life;” McCarty on
“Waohlngton and his little Hatclir

Meaning ot Washington’s Anni-
versary.“
