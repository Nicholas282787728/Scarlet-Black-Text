The Colfax Concert,

The Glee Club and Amphion
orchestra took their ﬁrst trip of
theseason last Friday evening. A
special train landed them in Col-
tax promptly at 7:30. giving ample
time to prepare for the concert,
half an hour later.

Colfax evidently expected a
good concert, as it greeted our
musical aggregation with a full
house. Nor was it disappointed,
if long applause and approving re-
marks, afterward overheard, count
for anything

The orchestra was up to its usu~
al standard and made splendid
music. The church was long and
the ceiling high, all ot which sup
ported the melodies with a most
pleasing effect, Every number
presented by the orchestra was
ﬁnely rendered, and their latest
acquisition, ‘Pilgrim's Chorus,’had
to be repeated in answer to pro-
longed applause.

The glee club, too, did well,and
was duly appreciated by the audi-
ence. Each appearance, except
the ﬁrst, was encored. and each en-
core was answered by some num-
ber from the club's ample stock of
humorous selections.

On the whole, the program was
a most excellent one, and the club
and orchestra are to be congratu-
lated on the success of their ﬁrst
outset-town concert. ltthcir oth-
er concerts are up to the same
standard, the spring trip will be
most gratitying both to the cities
visited and to the organizations.

Chresto Debate.

Next Saturday evening, Mar. 3r,
in the Congregational church, is
to occur the debate between the
Chrestomathian Society of Iowa
College and the Philomathian Sos

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL,

 

ciety of the State University. The
question tor debate, “Resolved
that the British claims in the con-
troversy with the South African
Republic,priorto Jan. 1. row, are
justiﬁable," is one In which there
is auniversal interest. The home
team is to support the afﬁrmative
side ot the question and the visits
ors will support the negative.
Both teams are putting hard work
into the question. and we may ex-
pect an interesting tugrotrwar
next Saturday evening.
Everybody knows that the sue
cess of a team does not depend
entirely upon the speakers. No
man can do his best when talking
to empty seats. It is only when
he looks into the faces of solid
rows of interested and sympathee
icauditors thatadebaterisillspired
to do his very best, The debaters
are doing their part in days and
nights of work. It remains now
for us, the students of Iowa Cola
lege and the citizens of Grinnel],
to do our part. We owe it to
our college, we owe it to our
representatives in the debate, and
we owe it to ourselves to be pres
ant and to cheer our men to victo~
ry. Remember the date, March

31.

Basket: Ball.

Last Friday afternoon the ﬁrst
of the ﬁnal series of basket ball
games was played between the
Senior Preps. and the Sophomores
which resulted in a decided victo~
ry tor the latter by a score oi,r2
to 4.

In the ﬁrst half the Sophomores
played much the better-game and
seemed to have things their own
wayI but towards the end of the
game the Preps. took a decided
brace and brought forth a great
deal of class spirit which greatly
strengthened the work of the
team. Neither class excelled in
team work, but the Sophomores
had somewhat better basket men
than their opponents, which show-
ed in the ﬁnal score,

For the “Sophs” Chase threw
some difﬁcult baskets and played
a very good game at guard.

Special mention should be made
of the work of both James and
Filmore who played guards for
the Senior Preps. They both
played a very fast game.

Grinnell Institute.

The program rendered at the
regular meeting ot Grinnell Insti-
tute last Wednesday evening
showed. as a whole, the most care-
ful preparation of any program
given thus tar this term, Too
much commendation cannot be
given those who took part, espe
cially as their audience was not
large.

Hulsizcr read an especially in»
teresting paper in which he dis
cussed the dorngs otour state legs
islature, Members of the society
were enabled to gain much valu-
able information on this subject.
One of F. Hopkinson Smith's
short stories “Tincture of Iron"
was read by Strauss. The selec-
tion was very suitable as regards
both quantity and quality.

Gleystcen. in a well prepared
speech, discussed the develop
ment of national sympathy and
showed how itisiapidly taking
the place ot a war spirit. Mr.
Gleysteen's delivery was particu-
larly good and he held the atten—
tion of his hearers well.

Special mention should be made
of the music, which consisted of
a vocal solo by Mrs. Heidel, with
violin obligate by Miss Rew. Mrs.
Heidel kindly appeared in a sec
onrl number in answer to the pro-
longed applause.

Extemporaneously, McFarland
discussed May and his senate
claim and Chase explained the
bill which has been brought up in
the state legislature, looking to»
wards the establishment of an ap-
pelate court, Both gentlemen
showed considerable knowledge
at current happenings along these
lines. The question tor debate,
“Resolved. That Porto Rico be
Admitted into the U. S. as a Ter-
ritory,” was afﬁrmed by Robison
with Arnold as his opponent.
Both lines of argument were well
outlined, thus enabling the audis
ence to closely follow the debate.
