IF It Grinnell athletic team has
never experienced the need of
perfect support the football elev-
en is experiencing such need at
present. The situation is more
discouragingthantorseveralyears
past; not because of the severe
defeats at Minneapolis and Madir
son, for they were expected, but
because several men who have
been beneﬁciaries of our athletics,
have shirked their responsibilities
at this, the most critical period of
the season. In short they have
either been persistently negligent
in attending practice, or have ap-
parently joined the ranks of the
“quitters” and removed their
moleskins for the season. Grin-
nell has taken great pride in its
college spirit and justly so, but
the need of revival of athletic
memories is painfully obvious.
The crisis, for such it is, cannot
rightly be met by the manage—
ment and team alone. The sup~
porters of the team have a part
to fulﬁll. Athletic teams derive
no small amount of the inspira-
tion that leads to success from the
student body. Other things being
equal, the team having the most
loyal support will win. It is not
enough that the faithful few should
be encouraged. There is need [or
reiorm work among those who
.have chosen to renounce their col-
lege colors. Itremainstorthcstu-
-dent body to take up a little miss
sionary work along athletic lines.
It is not necessary to suggest the
means. They should be perfectly
obvious. Here's to the “quittcrs;”
may they neverhnd the climate of

growth has been the essential
characterestic,

Since President Gates conle to
Grinnell in 1887, the number of
instructors has doubled; the line
come otthe college is more than
twice what it was then; and the
enrollment has increased with ale
most the same rapidity. New der
partments have been added; old
ones have been enlarged; and
standards of work made higher,
until today Iowa College is
second to none, so far as thorough
and scholarly work is concerned.
In all this era of progress, Presi-
dent Gates has been the leader;
his has been the guiding hand,
and to him largely belongs the
credit. Tobe sure, the founda~
tion was laid, and his assistants
have been able and willing, but
without discrediting his predeces-
surs or associates, we can justly
say that without him or some one
equally \\lell»ﬁlted {or the task,
our college could never have be
come the power it now is.

But the work of President Gates
is not to be judged by mere num-
bers alone. Indeed, the part he
has had in the material growth
of the college is but a small part
of what he has done for the stu-
dents. His inﬂuence upon the
lives of the students; the high
standard of honor and christian
faith he has placed before them;
and his unceasing efforts to lead
them into lives of large service
and helpfulness, will ever stand as
a measure of his work ill Grinnell,

it seems to be against the tradi-
tions of the college to make any
loud demonstrations upon an oc-
casion of this kind, and so in
harmony with this spirit, Scanner
AND BLACK has thus far refrained
from alludirigin any special malls

over to President Gates‘ resigna»
tion. Athough cur expressions
of regret are quietly marle, yet
they are none the less sincere.
we join with the \vholc college,
faculty, students, and friends, in
wishing President Gatus happir
ness and success m whatever work
he undertakes.
