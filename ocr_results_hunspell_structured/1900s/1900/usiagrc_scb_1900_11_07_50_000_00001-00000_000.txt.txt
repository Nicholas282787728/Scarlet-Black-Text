ArToken or Esteem,

on Monday atternoon the tac-
ulty ot iowa College presented to
President Gates a token oi their
esteem for him.

'This token was in the torm of a
large silver loving Cup, It was
not given as a gift: it is not the
incidental or intrinsic value ot the
cup which comprises the gitt. but
it is merely an outward exprese
sion ot‘the good will and heart-
telt interest ot the faculty in be-
haltofPres, Gates. who goes to
labor in other ﬁelds while his co-
workers continue with their duties
in Iowa college.

To be sure it it were the gift
and not the givers which were to
be thus remembered. something
more usetul would have sufﬁced,
but tor the purpose of showing
their good will to ourtormer pres-
ident,Cno more ﬁtting gitt could
have been given.

The cup which is made otoeau-
titully polished silver, bears this
inscription: “The Faculty otiowa
college to President George A.
Gates, Novcmber ﬁrst. 1900."

Though expressed in a few
words, this inscription bearsa his-
tory otthirteen years ot coopera-
tion and toil which we hope will
ever be a pleasant thought in the
mind oi our esteemed president.

’A Man in Our Midst.

The Grinnell team has not made
a heavy reputation for itself this
fall. It has not accumulated a
handsome scoreiin fact the total-
ity for the six games played
amounts to only thirty-three.
Nothing meteoric can be attached
to the team as compared with
those of former years.

One thing, however, stands out
as clear cut asa die. The con-
stant question is, “why do none ot
the team get hurt?“ “How can
those little buggers go up against
teams like Minnesota and come
out unscathed?” That is a very
pertinent question and ought to
be answered, Previous to the
past two seasons, broken bones
were the order ot the day. But,
beginning with last tall, a new fea-
ture was introduced. Not a‘man

~ was retired from the gridiron
through physical inability, The
same thing is true of this season.
-1n a game in which our oppo-

 

nents averaged 49 pounds to the
man above our men, no one was
hurt. A fellow who established a
recordin past years tor broken
bones, has played halt this season
through, ﬁguratively clad in a coat
of mail. “No one hurt” seems to
be the watchword. What is the
cause of this?

In our midst there is a man, He
isaquiet 'fellow, who blows no
horn. He has had years of ex-
perience in the schoolgot active
athletics, where he learned the
most effective means ot physical
development. 'Tis he who has
charge ot our teams. He condi-
tions the men properly and pre-
vents accidents. All honor to a
man doing such a work. Success
only should attend his efforts. All
should know him. His name is

“Jack.”

Henry G. Little,

One whose interest in our colr
lege has been steady and strong,
although not oPﬁcial, has lately
passed into the broader life. A
man always enjoying young peor
ple and sympathizing with their
work, Henry Gilman Little has
helped manya student to know
the true, the goodand the beauti-
ful,

To help others to help them»
selves, was his aim, He felt that
manual labor was a degradation
to no one; and he furnished work
on the brick house,
our president’s home, to many
students. This building was at»
terwards sold to the college, Mr.
Little himself donating 52,500 of
the value. The loss of such a life
from our community can but be
felt by each and every studentltae
miliar with the good gray head
which all men knew.

The Y. w. c. A. delegates re-
turned Monday morning trom

lOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1900.

Grinnell sent six delegates which
was a smaller number than most
of the others in comparison to
ourassociation. Upperlowa sent
twentyrtliree and a little associa
tion of nineteen members sent
ﬁve delegates. The Cedar Falls
Y.W.C.A. is next to the largest in
world, and was the largest until
this fall term. Its bible circles
are also the largest. some ot the

strongest leaders in America were

present and their talks tully ape
preciated. Among these leaders
were Miss Susan Paxon from the
Association Settlement in Chi-
cago, Miss Price, the College
Secretary of the Y, w. C. A. in
America, Miss Blodgett whose
Bible Study Outlines we are now
using. Miss Stahl who has just re—
turned trom eleven years work in
India, Miss Wilson, of Chicago,

Secretay of Iowa Mrs. C. A.
Rawson, Chairman of the State
Committee, presided at the meet-
ings, On Friday evening a
Geneva Song Service was held
under the direction of Prof. Fuller-
ton of the normal, and a slight
glimpse ot the conterence last
summer was given to those who
were not at Geneva. The dele-
gates received many very helptul
ideas and suggestions in regard to
the bible study and also the reg~
ular prayer meetings. on Thurs-
day evening, reports on the most
intesesting and’helpful points will

be given and every girl in college
ought to make it a point to be
present and learn something ot
what the association is doing.

Academy Chapel.

A plan has been devised to
bring the students of the academy
and its principal in closer touch
with each other.

Tuesday mornings instead of
meeting in chapel with the stu-
dents of the college, Prof. O’Con-
nor will meet the men of the acar
demy in the south room of Blair
Hall, which is known as academy
chapel, retaining its name from
former years when a similiar plan
wasin vogue. For some reasons
the plan was abolished but no
method had been devised to take
place of it, though it has long
been looked upon as favorable,

Now that it has again been
adopted we hope the men of the
academy will appreciate it and
show their appreciation by a faith-
ful attendance,
