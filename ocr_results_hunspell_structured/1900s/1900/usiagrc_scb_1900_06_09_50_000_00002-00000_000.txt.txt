A REC]: I e. ample of the It ud-

rress and good will on the part oi
our college organizations towards
one another was recently evi-
denced, which should not be ale
'iowedtopassunnoticed. TlieAtlie
ietic Union has been struggling
under unusual burdens diiiingtlie
past yearior two, relietfrom which
is no where in immediate sight de—
spite heroic steps taken by athiet»
ic managers and orﬁcials. The
Amphion Orchestra and Glee
Clubbon the otirer hand, are in a
most prosperous condition as the
result of the spring tour. After
deducting expenses and setling
aside the usual amount for the
sinking trrnd, the spoils were torrnd
to be in the neighborhood or 585.
This sum the glee club and orchese
tra have most generously voted to
the Athletic Union. Aside from
being a long step towards clearing
up the debt, it shows a good spirit
between our organizations, which
is commendable, The practice of
receiving such easy aid fioni othe
er organizations, it very much [ole
lowed, might prove demoralizing
to the Athletic Union. But con—
sidering the exigencies of the case.
the present act of the gleeclub and
orchestra can be only considered
as most timely and generous.

As THE Pnnsiz. l' Senior board
ot editors prepare to lay aside
their ofﬁcial duties, they look
back over a year oi no small im-
portance in the history otthe cole
lege. It has been a year marked
by steady growth and wondertui
activity in all departments o[ cole
lege life. The college has never
known so many prosperous and
vigorous organizations as it does
today, and the work of these or-
ganizations throughout the year
has been all that could be desired.
In this active, hurried life Scnﬁmz’r

AND BLACK has tried to do its part.‘

\Nhile it may have been a failuie
in many respects, the editors have
been animatedbyasinccrepurpose
to adhere to the policy outlined at
the beginning ot the year,to make
the paper a purely representative
publication. It has not been an
easy task and we cannot claim as
much srrccess as we irad hoped. but

some extent, at least, change the
policy of its administration. The
stir and activity occaarorred by the
arrival ot a new president makes
it all the more necessary tor the
college paper to attain a greater
excellence than it ever yet has
known. We feel that next year’s
board will be able to ﬁll all re-
quirements which shall come upon
them, Mr. N. F. Ellis, who will
hold the canoe oi managing editor,
has proved himseri fully capable
of handling all the interests of the
paper and ot directrng its policy
in a satisiactory manner. His
work on the paper this year has
proved hirn lolly capable ot hold-
ing the position which ire occupies
His assistants, Mr. McCarty, Mr.
Otis, Mr. Gleysteell and Mr.
Strauss are all experienced men
and should make a good corps or
editors. Mr. H. F. Thompson has
already shown himself an eﬁicient
business manager. The old board
has only the best wishes for the
success of those who are to follow
them. and bespeak for Mr. Ellis
and his assistants thc same gene
erorrs support trom the students
and taculty which has been nee
corded them during the yearjrrst
past.
