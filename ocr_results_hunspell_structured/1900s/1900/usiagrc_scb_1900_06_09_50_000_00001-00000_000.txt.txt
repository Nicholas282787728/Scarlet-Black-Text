Seniors, clad in cap and gown, sat
in a row on one side of the ﬁre,
while the Juniors sat opposite to
them on the other. The meeting
on this most formal occasion was
called to order by the Senior pres-
ident, VV..T. Waterman.

Miss Marion Bruntlctt address-

ment the bond of tribal affection.
the pipe of peace was brought
tortlhcercmoniously lighted and
smoked by the braves and squaws
of each tribe.

Miss Henderson ill behalf of
the Juniors read an Indian tale of
love and war, which was attentive-
ly listened to by the ﬁre lit assem-
bly, and peace then existed be-
tween thc great tribes so long at
war. The remainder of the even-

and singing. ‘

Such was the occasion of the
Sen-Jun jolliﬁcation, it was a
very appropriate and becoming
event. After a hard years work,
relaxation and abandon to the
light and airy is proper above all
things. And the present occasion
will be one long remembered by
members of the Senior and Junior
classes.
