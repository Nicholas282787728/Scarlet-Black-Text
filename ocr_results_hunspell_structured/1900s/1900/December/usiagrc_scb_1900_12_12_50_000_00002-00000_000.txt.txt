if has been a source of great
regret to all that the propos-
ed Debating League between
Beloit, Knox, Cornell and Grin-
nell could not be ﬁnally alianged.
The refusalrof Knox to iatiry the
compact began the difﬁculty, and

. i. cl do siopments so in. compli~
cated matters that it is now evi-
dent than "l he no debate
among any ot the DOVE named his
stitutions. Although, hus, rather
late in the season, Gl’lilneii was
lctt without a debate, negotiations
were begun with the result that
arrangements for a debate with
another school are now well under
way. We are very glad that in
spite of adverse conditions, the
debating interests are not to be
allowed to lapse inlo inaction. and
that Grinnell is to have an inter
collegiate debate this year as
usual.

tained in the last issue, Scam
AND BLACK, while taking no push
tive stand in the matter one way
or the other, desires to throw out
a few suggestions. Isn‘t the pres
ent time rather a critical one in
Iowa College athletics? Such be-
ing the cast. is it good policy to
place a man, good iii himself but
lacking the experience, in the
position or manager? Besides,
has it ever been customary to
elect an ilndcrclass man as foot
hall managers—anyone, in short,
but a Senior? Draltc has elected
a manager old at the business.
S. U. I. will probably do the same.
