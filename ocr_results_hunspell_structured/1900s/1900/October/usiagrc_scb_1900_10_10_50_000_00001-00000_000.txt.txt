interest for the class of tool last
Saturday evening. Although the
sLy was clouded the social com-
mittee set out with good courage;
nor was the majority or the class
to be daunted by a little shower
as they were assembled in wait
ing for conveyances. Soon, how»
ever, the sun dispelled all anxie»,
ties.

As the picnicers drew near the
wood two glowing bonﬁres were
scen and ﬁgures around them
whose movements indicated pre-
parations tor ameal. While en-
gaged in disposing or the viands
attention was drawn toward an ap-
proaching carriage the occupants
of which introduced themselves
by giving a “faculty yell.” 1901
felt highly favored by the pleasant
surprise, Betore departing Proi.

of the North Central Intercollegi-
