A

THE TRIP.

Another successful series of en-
tertainments has been added to
the already admirable history of
the Iowa College Glee Club and
Amphion orchestra. The spring
trip, to which the organizations
have looked forward with so much
eagerness and tor which so many
months have been spent in patient
practice. is now a thing of the
past. It can be safely said that a
better trip was never planned and
executed, as both clubs made ex—
cellent music, and were every-
where appreciated and commend-
ed. Nor was the trip without its
social as well as musical success.
Fine entertainment was afforded
in private homes, together with
occasional receptions, and to all
appearances the pleasure was
equally divided between the cue
tertainers and the entertained.

The initial concert of the trip
wasgiven at Clarion,April 6. As
could be expected, the ﬁrst con-
cert was rather a trial of nerves
and conﬁdence. Neither organir
zation was up to its usual stand-
ard. yet, on the whole, the con-
cert was tair and the good people
of Clarion seemed to enjoy it
thoroughly.

A moderately ﬁlled hcuse greetr
ed the clubs at Algona, April 7;
in response to which our musical
aggregation, under an incentive
from Professor Cole, took a brace
and gave a concert that was really
ﬁne. The people so considered it,
and scarcely a number escaped

 

without an encore. Sunday even-
ing special exercises were con—
d u c t c cl ill the Congregational
church,duringwhichtheclubsang
two sacred numbers and individu-
als oi the orchestra rendered solos.

The orchestra easily held the
ballner of favoritism at Estherville,
April 9 The character and rendi-
tion of the selections seemed to es-
pecially iascinate the audience, tor
they applauded again and again.
The glee club did good work, howv
ever, in giving pleasing diversions
between the orchestral numbers.

The concert given at Emmetse
burg, April to, was the best one
up to that time on the trip. The
house was well ﬁlled and was not
afraid to show its appreciation.
F. E. Tellier. an old glee club boy,
assisted the club in some of the
old college songs.

In spite of a disagreeable snow
storm, April 1!, the Spencer peo-
ple turned out in good numbers,
andpronounced the music as ful-
ly equal to that ot two years ago.
Both clubs did well.

A most elegant theater, modern
in every respect, was the scene of
the evening’s entertainment at Ft.
Dodge, April 12. But alasl Too
many attractions had preceded our
advent into the city, and a very
small audience greeted our people.
However,theconcertwasaworthy
one, and cast no small amount of
credit upon Iowa College.

At Perry, April 13, the concert
was’ given in the Presbyterian
church before a good audience,
which contained many Gl'innell
students. Here the glee club and
orchestra separated, and. most un-
tortunately, Mr. Cartwright, who
would have materially assisted in
ﬁlling out the remaining programs,
was compelled to return home on
account of illness.

At Storm Lake, April 14, a
double burden rested upon the
glee club, as it had to not only
sing twice the number of pieces,
but also to substitute something
in Mr. Cnrtwright's place. The
old chair drill was extemporized
with marked success and the club
carried out the program fairly
well. But the Storm Lake aud-
ience was a most difﬁcult one to
please. if they enjoyed the mus»
it: at all, their enjoyment was well
concealed.

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, APRIL 21, 1900.

Sunday morning, April 15. the
club sang in the Presbyterian
church at Storm Lake, and Sun-
day evening in the Congregation»
al church at Cherokee. The
Cherokee people, on the evening
of April T6, were well pleased
with the concert and promised a

warm welcome it the club should
come again.

LeMars was tavored on April
17 with by far and away the best
concert of any on the trip, and.
indeed some say, or any in the
historyotthecluh. The program
was marked with snap and ginger
from start to ﬁnish, and the crowd
was always ready with prompt
applause.

Conditions seemed to Combine
against a ﬁrst class concert at
Harlan, April 18. This was the
one poor concert. The club had
had a hard day’s journey and was
thoroughly tired out. The people
of Harlan, it is feared, did not
consider the concert equal to that
oftwu years previous.

A ‘goodly house attended the
concert at Atlantic, April 9, and
the music was good. As at sever-
al other places, the club took ocr
casion to sing in the high school
during the opening exercises.
This, everywhere delighted the
school children and left an im»
pression, which in time may be
productive of good results.

The last concert of the trip was
given at Stuart, April 20th, in the
high school room. The audience
was composed largely of pupils,
and they were well pleased with
the clubiso much so that the
club almost ran out of encores.

The great success of this long
trip is due almost entirely to the
efforts of two men. Prof. Cole
has worked untiringly with both
clubs since the ﬁrst of last Octo-
ber and has really produced wone
ders considering the size of the
school. His choice of selections
was exceptionally happy. The
muslc was ot a high order and yet
had pretty, catching melodies,
which even non-admirers of class
ical music could but admire. Mr.
R. S. Whitley has planned and
successtully carried to a ﬁnish the
longest trip ever taken by the
club. Special cars were provided,
accommodation secured in each
town in advance, no night travel-
ling, good contractsi'every detail
was looked after and provided by
the manager, and to him alone is
due the ﬁnancial success of the
trip. All praise rests upon these
two men and it should be gener-
ally understood that the remark-
able success of the sixth annual
tour is largely a result of their
most efﬁcient labors.
