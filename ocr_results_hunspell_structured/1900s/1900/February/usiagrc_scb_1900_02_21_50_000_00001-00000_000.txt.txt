F. Hopkinson Smith.

Mr. Smith is one of the most
successful of American writers of
ﬁction. All his writings are char-
acteiized by a moderate yet vig»
temperament. and by a
workmanship that is highly con
sistent with ptrre literary taste.
Some of the qualities that make
his stories and novels so der
liglltiuland well known are his
tclicity otexpression, aptness in
character portrayal, lively humor,
vivid description, and his intense
human sympathy with much of
real humor and pathos in life, He
is a master of forceful delineation
and has power of graphic dcscl‘ipa
tron and comprehensive grasp.
This endowment coupled with his
luen sympathy mikes him a de.
liglitliul writer and a true artist.
it is his simple and devout love
tor human lite, his deep fellow-
feeling with others in their varied
conditions ot joy or grief, placed
before us in a masterly style that
has given the author so high a
place among American, writers,
and gained for him an abiding
lo‘ve and appreciation in the
hearts of so great a number of
readers. . ,

Mr. Smith will base his lecture
which he gives hereon Friday eve»
ning, on his book entitled “Colori-
el Carter of Cartersville". It was
with the appearance of this book
that the author came into general
notice. it is probably Mi-sinitii's
best prllduction, [or it was on the
publication or "Colonel Carter"
thrt he became a prominent ﬁg-
ure in the literary world. This
lboolcis characterized by delicater

ly arranged humorous qualities,
and by the refreshing old-time
chivalry of the Colonel. The
story describes the life of an old-
tashioned Virginian, whose affec-
tion and goodwill are unbounded.
whose whole life isa continual
outrpouring to his friends, whose
motives and purposes are entirely
univorldly,a man whose sense or
honor is sacred to him. He goes
from his southern home to the
north, and ﬁnds himself run
aground, as it were, among the
breakers of business life in New
York.

The ﬁrst chapter introduces us
into the true southern life of
that period when the southern
gentleman was a prince, whose
plantation was his pride. whose
home was his joy, whose hos-
pitality was extended to all, and
whose honor was everything.

in the Colonel we see the typi-
cal early Virginian gentleman with
his traditional pride; in Chad
“dishin'the dinner" we meet a
perfect negro servant who is be
loved by the household. and old
Aunt Nancy presents to us the
line southern lady.

The old plantation of Carter
Hall has through long years oi
cultivation became impoverished
and the Colonel's only hope for
these valueless acres is his great
railroud scheme, the realization of
which is his one longing hope and
constant endeavor. But this vrs
roriary scheme fades away in thin
air, and leaves the old colonel
sad and despondent. yet brighter
days are in store for the old man,

for the coal ﬁeldsihatunderlie the
plantation offer rich retnrns.
Again the colonel's dream is to
evade him, for it is found that
the valuable land has been transr
{erred to Nancy atthe foreclosure
sale. but by kindly generosity the
noble Nancy restores the homes
stead and all its comforts to its
inmates. The Colonel had be-
came independent, “2: true south
ern gentleman had come into his

own."

The Universityof Wisconsin has
for the last ten or ﬁfteen years,
made a complete stenugraphlc re-
port of all the speeches delivered
in the inter-collegiate debates in
which the University took part
Ctipies ol the charts used are also
preserved. thus keeping on ﬁle
much valuable information for fu-
ture reference.
