glad that through the medium of

an opportunity is given [or a better
acquaintance and closer fellow
teeling among the colleges which
could hardly be reached any
other way. It is not our purposc
to make any predictions tothe rc-
sult at the contest, but no matter
who the winner may be, we feel
that the greatest thing accomp»

will reel better acquainted with us
and we with them. It is our hope
that Iowa College may not be
lacking in any endeavor to bring
about this end and that no single
event may occur which may be
remembered as an unpleasant
feature at the Oratorical contest
of xgoo.

department tor its further devel-

"Immunity” was the subject
of a very interesting and instruc-
tive paper by Dr. somers. Exr
periments, have shown that cer-
tain animals are immune to cer-
tain diseases. Also it has been
observed that some races of man-
kind are immune to diseases that
other races are susceptible to.
These observations have lead to
experiments to ascertain what
was the cause of this immunity.
From these experiments antir
toxln was discovered, which has
been such a great aid in the treat-
ment of diptheria. This paper
called forth a great deal of dis-
cussion‘as to the value of the
anti-toxin method of treatment
of disease.

The taculty et Genesis Collegir
ate institute has given to the as
sociation a room which has been
ﬁtted up specially for cabinet and
committee meetings. Iowa Col-
lege would not object to a similar
gift.

in the association at Howard
Payne College, Missouri, a college
girls' Club has been organized in
order to keep in touch with the
younger members of the school.
A club room hasbeen ﬁtted up by
the members of the Bible class.
This ls the center for the social
life of the college.

The association was greatly
helped and beneﬁted by the pres-
ence of Miss Paxson last week.
We only wish it might be possible
for her to visit us ottener. Snell
well-rounded noble characters as
hers are an inspiration to right
living and thinking. Miss Paxson
has a very happy faculty of put»

knowing just what they have time
to demand of pointing out the
best way to utilize what is given
to the honor of our Master whom
we serve.
