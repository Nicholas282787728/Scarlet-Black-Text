EXT Wednesday we start on
another half year of college

lite. To some, though they are
tew, it means ahaltyearot drudg-
ery, or of restraint, a time when
school is a sort or necessary evil.
But to most it means another half
year of opportunity. The last
half yzal'has added knowledge,
cap acity, power for greater
growth and development. New
avenues ot thought are opening
up, new ﬁelds ot speculation are
appearing. The room toi- learn-
ing seems greater than it did a
haltyenrogo, and yet eachone's
capacitylorlncreaseisgreater. Be
fore us there is another half year
in which we can add still more to
our powers ot usetulness. No-
where else are opportunities for
growth so numerous as In the
college atmosphere. In a very
short time, practically all who are
now in Iowa College as students
will have left the college and will
have left the atmosphere where
the chances for development are
best. It behooves us all then to
make rull use of the days that are
before us and to get out ot them
all that we possibly can in the
way ot power and development,
Who knows what the work of a
half year may mean in the lite

outside?

NEW PLANS FOR ORATORICAL
CONTEST.

A meeting of the faculty com-
mittee with the ofﬁcers of the Orr
atorical Association and the press
idents of the college literary so-
cietics was held Wednesday even»
ing to consider some means ct
increasing the interest in oratory.
The plan of combining the home
contest and the Hyde prize cons
test, and holding the single con~
test at Commencement in order
to arouse interest by making the
contest more important and offer—

ing a larger prize, was discussed.
but did not receive much support
and was abandoned, Various
other methods were suggested
but none of them were entirely
satisfactory. It was ﬁnally des
cided to do nothing at present
with regard to the home contest,
but a plan was ﬁxed upon, which
is to be suggested to the societies
as a solution for the Hyde prize
problem. Interest in this contest
is very poor and it is thought
that zest could be given by giving
it somewhat the character of an
intersociety contest, and doing
away with class distinctions. Ac-
cording to this plan, each society
is to choose two speakersto repre-

sent it in Hyde prize contest and
these ’speakel's may be chosen
from eltller of the three lower
classes. It is hoped by this plan
to get the societies actively in
terested In the contest and to
make it one oi the important
Commencement events. There
was some discussion of the idea
ot making prizes larger and only
awarding them to the ﬁrst and
second speakers. Grinnell has
been lacking in any oratorical in.
terest for years and a determined
el'lort will be made to arouse El
new enthusiasm in that tl<eful
branch at training. The Olatoris
cal contest is a college institution
which it is thought worth while
to keep up.
