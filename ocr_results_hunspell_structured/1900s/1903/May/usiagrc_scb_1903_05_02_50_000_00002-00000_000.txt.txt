Fot the sake of the floors tlils is a
good thingyet the men who watch
the tennis players in the men's
gymnasium seem tohavc forgotten
that only rnoocr shoes should be
worn it the ﬁner is to be kept in
the best condition. The men walk
about cnrclcssly on the llmr with
nails in their shoes which scratch
the ﬂoor and the result israpitlly
becoming easy to see, Also the
horse in thc gymnasium \Vlll soon
be beyond repair it it does not res
ceive better care. We are all lll'
terested in the gym. and

to be told by the gymnas im di-
rector to keep off the Rom.

. CCORDING to the plan
otltllliedin anothcrcoltlmn
every student can have a share in
hastening the coming of the libra-
ry which has oecn made possible
by the generosity of Andrew Car-
negie. and every one can help
wrthout any great effort. This
plan, if successful, and it will be
successful, \thl mean the interest
on a large sum or money and will
be an appieciztble item in the fund
tor the support or the liblaty.
Grinnell is proud or her splendid
librrtry facilities and with only a
little effort the students in college
now can give material help, he
sides showing the spirit of the
student body in supporting Cole
legeiltstitulions. You can show
your Grinnell spirit in no better
way than by pledging the small
amount that is asked and at the
sametime help along a worthy
cause.
