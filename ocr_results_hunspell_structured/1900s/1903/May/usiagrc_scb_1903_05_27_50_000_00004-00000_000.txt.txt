LECTURE COURSE FOR NEXT
YEAR.

Since the ﬁnances of the Lee-
ture Course are at a low ebb now.
the natural supposition would he
that next year's plan would in-
volvea rather conservative out-
lay {or talent, but on the com
trary. quite the opposite is the
case. The committee believes
thatthe increase in expenditure
wrll cause such an increase in the
quality of attractions presented.
that there will be a correspond
tngly greater increase tn patrons
age. So. acting on this princtple
or “Nothing venture. nothtng
-It has contracted a
course which is tarthe best given
in Grianell tor a number ot years,

Not wishing to compete with
the School of Music Artist's Re»
citals. a musical number of an en»
tirely different character has been
secured. Sorrentino. the great
Italian composer and conductor
will appear with his famous Barr
do Rossa, as the ﬁrst number of
the course. This Band was sea
cured in preference to a number
of others for the reason that it is
undoubtedly the best Band in
this country today. This is the
Band that took tirstptace in coma
petition tvith sixty~four other
bands, the best in Europe, at the
Genoese Exposition a tew years
ago. The committee is proud to
present tsuch a number though
it does so at a great expense.

By a special arrangement with
the management at the Record
Herald. Grinnell is one of twenty
college towns to have the privir
legs of listening toone of William
E. Cllrtis’ addresses, which are
mixtures of travel. art. history
and polttics in much the same
style as his interesting letters.

While here l\lr.Curtiswi|l write

appear in his paper,

were intensely interesting. He
will lecture this time on a popular

subject, “Legend and Life” (an.

interpretation of the Tannhaeaser
story.) which we are assured gives
lree play to his brilliant oratory.

Isabel Garghill Beecher is rec
ognized asthe onercader. When
she appeared here two years ago
in combination with Glenn Hall.
many expressed regret that she
was not given a whole number on
the course. so she will be given a
chance next year to do her very
best work. which is. as everyone
knows. sontcthtng superb.

Samuel Strttuss of Des Molnes
has consented to give us one at
his stirring addresses the suhyect
being. “The American Drama.”

lively and rather
ideas.

First a tarmet boy. then a Uni»
versity graduate. then a preacher,
and then a laborer. George G.
McNuts has a ﬁne training for
the lectures he delivers. He is
not a socialist. simply a working
man. preacher, and though almost
unknown inthts partot the counr
try. is recognized in the east as a

powertut raetor in the solution of
the labor prohlem.

The price for the six numbers
will be two dollars.
