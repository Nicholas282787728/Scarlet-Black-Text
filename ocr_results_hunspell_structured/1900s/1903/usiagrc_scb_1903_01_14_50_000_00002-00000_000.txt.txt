and BLACK in charge ot the
Christian Associations, certainly
brought to the attention eiall our
readers, an idea ot what the new
chapel means. Looking at the
cuts of the beautiful Association
buildinesot other schools brings
out still mote torcthly than has
been done, how well Iowa College
could use such a building. The

an effort will be made to avoid
such conﬂicts henceforth and
meanwhile no one who cares to
have an intelligent understanding
or present day conditions and
problems in the South can afford
to miss another meeting.

At the meeting Monday, Miss
Hill read an instructive article on
the southern factory employees,
throwing light especially on the
condition and number of child
laborersemployed. Prof.Wyclcoff
gave a resume ot industrial con-
ditions generally and drew some
deductions therefrom in regard to
the probable tuture prospects et
the South. Mr. Paul described
the ﬁnancial conditions and needs
of the people. showing that lack
ot capital and proper credit facile
tties have much to do with the
backward industrial condition of
the people.

be adopted. The purpose in are
ganiriug is to have a basis lor

to have as iew and simple rules
as possible so that the tvork done
may be free and spontaneous.
