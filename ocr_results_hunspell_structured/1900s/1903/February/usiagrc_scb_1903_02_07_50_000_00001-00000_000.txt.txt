SOME PROBLEMS OF OUR RURALl
SCHOOLS

The illustrated lecture given on.
last Thursday evening by Mr,
Orville Bright, Superintendent of
the Cook County, Ill. schools,
was much appreciated by all pres»!
iiis subject, “Some I’l'ob~‘

ent.
lenis of our Rural Schools
treated in an original and enter
taining manner. He pointed out
the tact that while great progress
is being niadein other litres or
educational work. the country
school is almost without a cham-
pion. At aveiy small increase in
expense the rural school buildings
could be changed li-orn the cracker-
box style to benuiitul examples or
architecture. Until the school
buildings and yards are made at»
tractive, comtortableand sanitary,
you cannot expect the children to
accomplish the best results,

In mostr-ui-aldistrrctsthe school
buildings are the only piece of
property which the patrons own
in common and for this reason it
should be not the most desolate
and delapidated property in the
community, but the most inviting
and cheerful. The general effect
of Mr. Blight'slccltirc upon the
of the audience was a

MISS ESTELLE PADDOLK.

The Y. W. C. A. here has long
been looking forward to the Visit
of MissA Estelle Paddock, the
State Secretary of the Iowa Asso-
ciations and her visit is bringing
tothe girls all the help and in»
mi \\lliCl\ they have
been hoping. Her talk on Thurs-
day eveningttlas very helplul to
the large number of girls present.
She spoke very practically upon
the general topic~“l’ut ye on,
Cliiist”7bringing forcibly home
to the girls the necessity of gctr
ting the Christ spirit into their
lives and “practicing Christ”
every day. Following the talk
an inrornial reception was held in
ICliresto hall, iihcre each girl nrei
Miss Paddock personally. Owing
to conﬂicting Cverits the attcndr
ance at the Friday evening scrvA
ice was small, biit those present
found the practical, carriest talk
“Cll worth the (Hort they made
in attending. M , Paddock spoke
upon ihe \Vt‘lt]57"l)cliglll thysclt
also in the Lord, and He shall
give thce the desires of thine
heart." She particularly eiiiplia-
sized the thought that
noble and iioithy otlr desires and
ambitions may be, not
use them ror our oivn gloi‘y,or lor
the approbation which may come
to us, but we must do all to the
gloryol God, alloiving Him to
govern our desires, in order that
we may covet earnestly the best
thingsithe which are
really worthwhile. Miss Paddock
will remain until Monday and as
during‘ihe past t\\0 days will be
glad to have personal talks with
any of the girls. Because or the‘
regular class piaycr meetings she
will not speak this evening, but
ivili address the girls at tour
o'clock Sunday afternoon
Chresto hall. Every girl is espe»

cially urged to be present to-

which is hers if she will but take
