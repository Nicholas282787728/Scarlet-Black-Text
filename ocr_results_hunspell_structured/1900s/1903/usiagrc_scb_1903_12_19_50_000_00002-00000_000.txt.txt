THE WALTER WELLMAN LEC-
TURE.

interesting Discoulse given VVcdncsday
Night by a well Known NewsV
paper Man.

The American public loves to
listen to men who have achieved
successintheirproressionsthrough
hard work and energy and as
Hamilton Mabie has said "Work
is sacred because it uncovers the
soul of the lvorlce_ so Gi'innell al-
ways holdsin highest esteem those
expr'cssions of a man‘s soul ll“ his
work as he transmits :tllem tolls
from the lccluic plattoinl.

Mr. Wellman's lecture “Behind
ttre scenes at Washington," can
scarcely tsc called in the common
ly accepted term a lecture. It is
rather an interesting narration or
events as we would hear from the
lips of a iriend who had vi:lted
that city and become acquainted
with all the important petsonnges
there. But it istoltl
charming now ot rhetoric, with
such perlect and yet simple the
tion that we know we are listening
to a master story teller. The nai-
mtor brings before our eyes a beau

magniﬁcent buildingsand delight-
ful avenues, Then follows num-
erous incidents connected with
those men who are foremost in
our nation today. Although one
may judge that the speaker used
too freely, anecdotes and stories
connected with life in our capital,
yetby these he brought out in
many cases title conceptions oi

men and zirfaiis which his limited I

time could have otherwise prohio
ited. ’

man as it polished lecturer. tie
does not pose as such. lie is as
he says, a l‘epot‘ter,nti ohscrvcr ol
men and affairs, a leader of public
opinion, and through his eyes he
shows us many things of interest

city in the land.
