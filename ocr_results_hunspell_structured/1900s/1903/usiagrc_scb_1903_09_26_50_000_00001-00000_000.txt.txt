DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
SPEAKING.

A Word About the new Plans {or
Trainingin Rhetoricals, We are

to Develop Here.

For a long time past a great
lack
legeiln that there has never been

has been felt in Iowa Col-

a course whereby students may
obtain real scientiﬁc‘ training in
the artof public address. It was
this need called Miss
Glenna Smith to Grinnell. So
this year a great pleasure

which

it is
to mark the advent of Mr. Ryan
into our midst with a still higher
developed idea of that which we
most need. and it is only necessary
to look Into the class in public
speaking to convince one or the
popularity of the course.
The end which
iaculty are working is to institute

towards the

a department oi public speaking.
This
1 Course

consists or tour courses:
in Public speaking.
2, Course in Debate. 3, Course
in F

Course in Oratory.

temporaneousSpeaking, 4.

Of these four courses there are
two now being given. that in pub
lic speaking and the course known
as that of argumentation and (lEr
bate.

The purpose or the tormcr is
primarily to develop a public
speaker. The second will besini~
ilar to the one last year as cont
ducted by Prof. Noble and will
consume the time during the ﬁrst
semester. During the se c o n d
semester the class will concern
itself more properly with the prin
cipics of debating.

In all these courses no attempt
will be made to study tor the stage
orconcert presentation Mr. Ryan
is hate for the beneﬁt of the stil-
dents as a whole and will conduct
no individual classes outside of
college work.

Mr. Ryan was a very enthusi
asiic member of the class of 1902
of Cornell University. New York.
He graduated with great honors
in public speaking. dramatics and
oratory. Three ycais were spent
by him at the Ithaca Conservatory
of Music in the study of his favor-
ite art.
