a wtnning one the loss, of a game

' the loss of the game need not be
discouraging. Such is the predi-

Events Expected.

A Week from today, on Salr
urday, April 25. the annual honre

meet will be held at Ward Field.

Entries for the meet will be
published next Wednesday. Tire
home meet is interesting as the
time or the ﬁrst contests for the
track men and on account of the
class rivalry which always exists.
The form shown by the runners
and Jumpers will give seine idea
or the quality of work that can
be expected from the track squad.
Thisyearihe class rivalry is as
strong as usual. Tire class of
1903 has won the home meet for
three years and this time a de-
termined effort will be made by
the under classes to defeat the
Seniors and such a result is quite
probable. The Sophomores will
put tip a strong light for ﬁrst
place with good prospects tor
winning it. The seniors have
Evans and VVellt'er for the half
and quarter and will win places
in boiir events, probably ﬁrst in
one or both. Haines seems to
be the strongest candidate [or
