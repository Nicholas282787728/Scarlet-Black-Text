ball in which both teams played
from start to ﬁnish, neither side
scoring until the last few minutes
of the ﬁrst half, at which time
Clark made a basket from the
ﬁeld and scored the ﬁrst two
points for Grinnell.

In the our/nor for January 3i is
an article by Dr. Edward A.
Steiner on The German Immi-
grant in America. It is an in

ot the different classes of Ger-
mans that have come to America
at different times. They all add

population tor nearly all are fairly
well educated, are industrious,
frugal and honest. In religion
they have not kept pace with their
development along other lines for
many ot them are skeptics and
German churches seem to grow
narrower instead of broader and
do not by any means keep pace
with the chuich in Germany.

The German has also been very
susceptible to the materialistic
money making tendencies of

he has infused strength and vigor
into the Ameiican state and is a
