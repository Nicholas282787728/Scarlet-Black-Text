once more to the dusty annals
of football history.-

As to the relative merits of the
two teams this season. we can
onlyjtidge by the unsatisfactory
method ot comparative scores.
Grinnell in the ﬁrst game of the
season defeated Coe by a score of
20 to o; Antes three weeks later
defeated the same team bya score
of 36 to 5. Minnesota swamps
Grinticll in her second game by a
score of 39m 0. and one

team to the tune of 45 to o.

No real comparison; however
can be drawn from these games

A GREAT EVENT.

What Some of Our Own People Say
About Banda Rossa.

The general impression is that
students and citizens are going to
have the musical treat of their
lives on Nov. 18. and there is no
question that this impression is
founded on fact. A number of
Grinnell people have heard Banda
Rossa in eastern cities and pro-
nounce it the very best band they
ever listened to. Professor Fink
says, "That band is superb. Those
Italians simply breathe out
music." Librarian Douglass. who
heard Banda Rossa in Minneapo-
lis says, “lnnes.Sousa. and Brooks
do not compare with Sorrentino
as conductors, We will hear the
best band in the United States.”
Will Staat.'oo. heard Banda Rossa
in Chicago a number of times and
says they took by storm the music
lovers of that city even though
they had the fast competition of
Thomas’ Orchestra and a number
of other excellent organizations.

Press ‘notices are not hard to
collect from country ncwspapers
but it will be seen that the press
notices in the Banda Rossa circu-
lar are taken trom such papers as
the “Boston Herald,” ”New York
Sun,” “Denver Times," etc. and
when such excellent recommenda-
tions are backed up by the state-
ments of our friends in town and
college we may be sure ot their
veracity and ot the high quality
of the attraction.

When King Humbert of Italy
died, Sorrentino. who was at that
time in this country with his Band,
sat down. as soon as he received
the sad news. and wrote a funeral
march which he cabled to Rome.
This was the march which was
played by the Royal Italian Band
as it led the sombre procession or
the King's last earthly journey—
to the grave. That shows the re~
spect which is felt for Sorrentino
in Italy. the birth place of modern
music

The name “Banda Rossa"
means in Italian "Red Band,‘.’ and
is given this organization because
the members all wear red coats
and caps. which present avery
striking appearance. but the name
has come to signify not only red
coats but a retlrhot variety oi
