THE BASEBALL siTUATION.

After the decisive score with
which Ames administered defeat
to us, the hopes and enthusiasm
of the local fans ivas very much
dampened indeed. But
contest with Iowa whose team has
experienced some ofthe most se
vere practice this spring, our boys
put up a game which is to be come
mended in every respect and once
more Grinnell is thrown into the
whirlpool of popular speculation.
Itisvery much to be regretted
that unfavorable weather has ins
tertered with practice as well as
the contests sceduled, for base
ball is a game which needs all
the constant practice and experi-
ence possible. it is generally
conceded that if Grinnell can
win her second game from Ames
that we have practically won the
bat. Although this may be pos—
sible, later developments may
arise which will greatly alter the
opinion of the surmiser. An in-
teresting feature of the prospect
is thatrecentlyin an uncompleted
Ames—Coe Coilegegamethe score
stood 4 too in favor of the latter.
So it all [,rests upon our next
contestggwith the Agriculturists
whether we still have a chance at
the bat. If success should attend
our “twirlers” it would need but
one more Victorious season to
hold the silver bat among our
many other trophies, as a perma»
nent memorial of Grinnell's pow.

tendance is expected.

SOME CHANGES IN NEXT YEAR'S
FACULTY.

One of the most forcible re-
minders to old students who return
to college next fall, of the fact
that another year has come and
gone, will be the presence oi new
faces upon the cliapcl platform as
well as the absence of familiar
ones. Various combinations of
circumstances have conspired to-
ward a few changesin tlie tacuity,
some permanent and others
temporary.

lNTERaSOCIETY DEBATE.

Third Debate oi the Yeariclose Contest
May be Expected.

Next Saturday evening the
third intertsociety debate will be
held at thechapel. The Institute
will be represented by H. C.
Weber, 'o5, Paiil R. Trigg, ’05.
and Lehr Lee, '05. and the
Chrestomathian team is composed
of J. I. Heeren, ’05, Arthur Bar»
nard,’06, and C. C. Chapin, '04.
Both teams are composed of
workers and have been studying
faithfully for several weeks. The
subject for debate is, Resolved,
That the franchise sllould be taken
fromthe negro in America. The
judges have not yet been chosen.

Debating interest has taken un-
usual strides at Grinnell this year
and this debate will be one to
help keep up that interest. It is
the third of the year’s series and
both societies will make special
efforts to win it. Altho it comes
at a time when other events de-
tract from interest in society work,
it is thought that a good sized
crowd will witness the contest
Saturday evening. The usual
system of rebuttal for each speak-
er will be followed. Grinnell’s
record for the year in debating
has been the best ever made and
this debate will be a ﬁtting close
for the year's work. No admission
will be charged. The debate will
begin at 8 o'clock.
