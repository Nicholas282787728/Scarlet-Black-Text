Angelo has created so noble and
so strong an embodiment ot a
character of this type is a great
tribute to his imaginative power,
so opposed is it to the heroic
tempestuous soul strugglingin his

Michael Angela’s prophets and
slbyls are among the highest
creations not only ot his genius
but of all art. They reveal the

technical skill of a master and
profound thought as well. He
was deeply imbued withlhe spirit
of these prophets of old and his
conceptions of them are worthy
oi deep and prolonged study.
Much that is vital and elemental
in human experience in its most
signiﬁcunt moments is here em-
bodied and reveals itself to us
'only graduully, tilriugh patient
study. As we begin to appre-
hand this, we can well believe
Vittoria Colonna's words that

words was as little beside what

some echoes oi the prophetic
voice, to apprehend, dimly it may
bc, something of God's life in the
world. These prophcts of old
may help us by their silent sym-
pathy to strive more earnestly to
see the ctcrnal signiﬁcance of our
common life.
