HAT if We had Won last. Satur-
day? It would have been no
trouble at all to geta good crowd to
go to Des Molnes next S atur day.
NOW it is a. herculean task to get foot
ball enthusiasts who are ardent
enough to accompany the team and
give them the encouragement that.
they need right now, It is in a situa-
tion such as this that the football
squad deserves a little boost, When
they win they store up some enthusi-
asm of their Own. When they lose it
does’t make than: real any better to
see the support or the student body
slipping out lrom under them.

All doubm as to the quality oi the
game Saturday should be dispersdr
Drake‘s showing last :week was little
better than our own and it isi'ully rec-
ognized that the game at the Stadium
on this week is yet to be won. The
other attractions should b6 taken into
conslderatlon also. Now is the time
00 make a visit to Des Moiues that
will be proﬁtable to you and your col~.
lege.

“No matter how iii: a slump Grin-
deiltakeo earlier or later. the team
that plays Drake always puts upa
great game.”

That's the way they feel about it at
Drake. Their memories are very
ﬂood. ' '

HE Y, M. C. A. lecture course is

deserving 0! more attention than it
has been receiving. It is a part of the
educational advantage or the institu-
tion and has as its purpose to present
in Grinnall the very best attractions
that can possible be afforded, The
extra number, just added is of great
value from a historical standpoint, It
is the record or a great oumpaigu told
by one who went through it all and
who knoh‘s how to explain its alumni-

The visit or Mai. s. n, M, Byers 01

Des Moines to this city Tuesday even-
ing: brings one of the grand old men
of Iowa to Grinnell for the ﬁrst time,
Maj. Byers has attained a prominence
which it is given to few men in this
state to achieve. A soldier in the re-
bellion, he served with distinction
and wrote one 01 the greatest war
epics “Sherman‘s March to the Sea"
having been one of Gen. Sherman’s
stall. The story of Maj. Byers’ es-
cape from prison is a thrilling one
since those strenuous days Mail Byers
has secured the boards from the
prison with the hole in them through
which he made his escape. In the
capsular service and as a writer and
publiespeaker he has won recognition
He is one or the old school gentlemen
and his \‘isitshould be an event of
interest to many people, particularly
to the members of the G. A. R. who
will doubtless give their honored

Collil'adea, large hearing.

——Mr. Schevc has great ability (or
bringing., out the resources or an organ
and‘h’e‘doesiit with‘au‘iease and grace-
fulness that is remarkable. The
grand instrument responded to his
magic touch like a thing or lire, and
his interpretation of the compositions
of the great masters was a revelation.
