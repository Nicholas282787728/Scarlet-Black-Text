Now is a good time to renew these
New Year‘s resolutions. The close of
the ﬁrst semester gives you a chance
to do‘hctter in the second.

some students have been heard to
express the hope that the revised edi-
tion of the IOWa College catalogue will
read. “In place of the former drop
system, half yearly examinations have
been adopted.” It would save alot
of Work and worry.

SCARLET AND BLACK stated some
time ago that Grinuell was not in Cor-
nell's class when it cztme to debating.
The Cornellian immediately inter-
preted that 2.5 meaning that Giinnell
was superior to Cornell. We haste to
assure our good brother that he is
mistaken. A record of Six defeats
and one victory is convincing proof
that we are not in Cornell's class.

we are down and do not hesitate tosay

coming semester; to those who have

FOR MEN ONLY.

Last Monday night about twenty
men responded to the invitation to
meet in Professor Macy‘s Room for
the purpose of organizing a class to
study missions. A course was out.
lined which will include tlle study of
Jillian, China, India, Africa, Turkey.
Austria, the Philippines. and Home
Missions. Tile plan is to have some
student prepare a lecture On one or
these vast ﬁelds, several nights being
given to each of the larger ones, aiicr
which the meeting is thrown open ior
general discussion.

X0 more attractive study is oﬂered
in school than this class. It is hoped
that through this means an aroused
interestiu missions among the men
may be secured. The class meets
[tour 8 to 5), every Monday evening.
\Vhat we want is to have at least ﬁfty
men out to these informal discussions.
Notoniy is the religious liie of the
different people discussed but also
their customs. economic condition,
their government. and all interesting
phases 0i their life. Some illustrated
lectures may be given during the year.
We want you to come. Can you spend
a more profitable hour? Come out
and try a sample next Monday night,
