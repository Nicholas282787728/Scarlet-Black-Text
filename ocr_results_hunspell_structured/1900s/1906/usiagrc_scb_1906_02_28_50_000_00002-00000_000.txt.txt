HE recent action of the faculty
in adopting a system of exami-
nations will be considered by all as 3
Wise measure. The tendency of the
past few years has been in this chair
Zion and if: was an open secret that
the “drop” system had become a dear]
letter. The proposed changes are not
radical; neither are they out ()[har-
money with the present order of
things as the system has been worked.
The crowding of drops 0r so~called
drops into the last week ofeveryser
mester has resulted in a general Grams
nring in some subjects to the detri-
mentof others. Under the proposed
system. examinations are a possibility
at certain dates and are asnre thing
at the close of the Semester. This
will give the students due warning
and they can prepare accordingly. We
believed the proposed system will
work out satisfactorily, and with jus-
tice to both student and instructor,

HE board of trustees and the inn-
ultyhave passed resolutions to

the eiiect that the lights in all of
thecollego buildings will be turned
out. at eleven o’cluck hereafter un~
less there is some good reason for
not doing so The reasons assigned
are ior economy and for safety. This
action will mean that all social events
will have to begin at the appointed
time if they are to be carried out suce
cessiully. The Superintendent or
grounds and buildings has been given
his orders and we can be assured that
they will be carried out to the letter.
The act is not an arbitrary one as
thereis no reason why social doings
cannot begin at seven thirty just as
well as later, and if begun on Lime
the lights can very properly he ex»

tingulshed at eleven.

LEGE’S SOLDIER BOYS.

The death of Gen. David B. Hender-
son touches the hearts of the college
‘boys’ of 186»! Very tenderly. Iowa Col-
lege was represented more largely in
his regiment than in any other during
Civil War. They are proud of his
brilliant career since the War and
grateful for the sincere interest which
he has always manifested in them.
They can never iorget the eagerness
with Which he forwarded the largest
amount that We Were Willing to do-
cent from any person [or the Soldiers’
Memorial Tablet, which decorates the
Wall at the entrance to the chapel.

In it recent number of the “SCARLET
