in giving the animal spirits or the

ohild a respectable way to vent ltseli,
thereby preventing its escape in Crim-
inal directions Which was the caSE
under the old directions. The most
permanent accomplishments, how-
ever, were in the direction 01 laws
passed (I) prevent and destroy the
slums. By legal proceedings it is
now possible, as it was not ten years
ago, to condemn and tear down a
building which is destructive to the
health and morals of any community,
and by the provisions of the statutes
builders are compelled to construct
their apartment houses in accordance
With certain regulations which in
sure the safety oi the tenants who are
tolive in them. Actual experiment
shows that very respectable accomoda-
tions can be given the poor of the City
at no greater cost to them than before
and Still an honest dividend be real-
ized 0D the investment. Mr. Itiis says
that the reformed conditions in lower
New York, good homes, good schools,
parks and play grounds, go n great
way toward Settling the immigrant
problem. it is not what the poor vis-
itor to our shores brings us but what.
wellnve to oﬁer him, that will deter-
mine Whether he is to be a load on
the nation’s shoulders or a. good citi-
zen. Thislast Is the very thing in
View. We want citizens and not
criminals and the only way to bring it
about is to start them right when
they are yDung. It cannot be {lune
under the old system of oppression and
extortion. It can be done under the
new. It is not wickedness which
raises criminals in the New York

slums, but weakness. Take away the
temptation to evil and a good citizen
is the result.
