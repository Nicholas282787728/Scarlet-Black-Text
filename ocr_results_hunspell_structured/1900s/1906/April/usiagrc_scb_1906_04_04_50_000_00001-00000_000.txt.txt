TI-IE VESPER SERVICE.

Tlleissue or your paper for March ->\,
1906, contained a letter signed “A
Student", which is in eiIectaSharp
arraignment oi the Sunday Vesper
service at Iowa College. To the ques-
tion raised by us writer, “Is Vespers
ser rig the purpose [or which it was
intended?” his answer seems to be in
the negative. The reasons given are
(ll that a disproportionate amount or
time is dewted to music, i2)tnat the
music used, or at least some of it, is
not worshipiul and uphiting, and (3.)
that the service is too formal.

It is perhaps presumptious [or me
to say anything in reply, in view or
the {act that I did not live inUrinnell
no the time the Vesper services were
inaugurated here. but I shall not at:
tempt to deﬁne the purpose which the
serrlc , n the minds 0! the founders,
was intended to serve. I will merely
state what seems to me to be in gen-
eral the function of such it service and
to apply that test to the one that has

found a place in Iowa College.

Vesper services, in the common use
of the term meaning services held on
Silndayaiternoon. seem to be widely
regar led as primarily praise services;
the emphasis being placed on the mu-

sic and not upon the preaching. The
quality oftlle music at such services
is usually high, the best obtainable,
and manv beautiful arrangements of
the. 'ptul'es have been prepared ior
responsive reading in connec on with
Chants and anthems, There has come
quite naturally to he a certain iornr
ality in the order of \Vol‘ship: but to
many there is genuine inspiration in
taking part with many other people

It would seem that music is an in-
tegral part oitlre Iona College \'es~
per service and that atsvmilzll services
elsewhere itis regarded as relatively
more important than any other lea-
LiIre. In view of the fact that the
speakers ireuuently use from twenty»
ﬁve to tlili'ty-iive minutes of the hour
allotted to the service, the critic' in
that too much or the time is de~
voted to music, vocal and instrument,-

similar services elsewhere. as being

service.” ’

Surely any criticism which adro~
Oates the lowering of the high stand-
anl OI the music which has had place
on the programs at the Vesper service
will not meet with any favor in Grin-
Dell: and I believe that our L‘ritic is
practically alone in his position on
this point.

There exists a rather lurge and un-
questionabiy earnest class of people
whose minds seem to be obsessed with
the notion that dramas and operas
are necessai‘ and of themselves, a
wrongful, or at least a doubtfully Val-
uable, form of entertainment. One
rarely ﬁnds that such people think of
considering the drama. and the opera.
as iorms of art, and as such possessing
enormous power of swaying and in-
ﬂuencing the human heart and mind.
They naturally regard with pious hare
rorthe thought of listening to any
Opel-a music at a religious service, evi-
dentiy believing that all Such music
must necessarily bear a secular llavor
which forever bars it from Ii. place anti
time of devotion. But, its is well
known, there occur frequently in
many of the so-called grand operas

pressiveness Voicing the highest hu»

greatest geniuses that ever lived. oc-

Butuiter all. if our critic has [alien

their feelings should be respecleli and

DECISION FOR NEGATIVE.

The Judges Accord the enresromorhian
Sophomores a Unanimous Vole at
the Final Forensic Contest
A small crowd was present at the

chapel Satuidily evening to hear the
third inter-society debate of the pres-
ent year. As has been the case for
selerai years past the representatives
from the Chrestomathian society won
the deciding contest, and thereby
carried off the society honors. The
debate was no less interesting than
those which have preceded it and
from the start every point was well
contested. The men of the winning
team excelled in delivery and handled
their side of the case more Ilueutiy.
The negative put up a strong light
and showed a clear knowledge of the
question but were unable to cope sucA
cesstuily with their more experienced
opponents.

The question was that or the con—
ventional turili with Germany and is
one of the live issues of the day. The
aim-motive was upheld by the Insti-
tute team consisting of A. M. Kent,

PROSPECTS.

What Some or the Iowa Schools Hope

Jinan-ling Has Begun.
Though the season is barely opened,
and the change irom gym or training
shed t0 the outdoor track iretyuently
alters the aspect or things. observers
oi athletics in the various schools are
waking up and wondering vilrere the
surprises are going to come lrom this
year. Itis even reported that in some
places the inevitable "dopester" is pre-
paring lus lists. '
The indoor meet between Iowa and
Normal is supposed to give a line on
the condition in those two schools,
Though Iowa won the meet by a good
margin, Normal seems so t i s n e d
with her showing. Hamilton is evl.
dently to be reckoned within the hut--
dles and Noble is doing last work in
the quarter. Normalites are malriug
no prophecies as to their general hopes,
but the showing they have made at
state meet the lost two years gives
thema right to expect agreat deal
Irom their athletes. Iowa is a little
holdel'lnllerassertions. The recent
receipt or the state cup, turned over
to her by Drake, is spurring her on to
a determination to make it a permae
nent possession. Remiey in the two-
mile and Bl'ainerd in the mile are pro-
éuciug anticipations or two more rec-
ords to be placed to Iowa’s credit, and
Capt. lh-owu is supposed to besure in
the hurdles. The majority or Iowa's
men am new and much depends upon
the manner in ‘wlriclr they develop.
Uni l they have done a little morcont-
door until no certain guesses can be

ventured.
