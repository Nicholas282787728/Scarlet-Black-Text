HE approachoi spring brings forth
a revival oi interest in spring
athletics. In another column is noted
the meeting of the baseball men, and
this afternoon a meeting of track Mil»
letes will take place. SCARLET Ann
BLACK wishes to call the attention of
the new men to these ﬁelds of activi-
ties. There are opportunities for all
men in both departments. None at
the places will fall to men by inheri-
tance, but will d'epend on the ability
shown by the various candidates.
Grinnell needs and can use every avail-
able man, No fellow knows what he
can do, until he has tried
One oi Griunell’s greatest stars was
aman whom they dubbed ”Speedy,”
because of his slowness, and yet by con-
sistent training, we have developed
the fastest splinter that the state has
produced in years, Opportunity
knocks but once; now is your chance.

Two sensational baskets were secur—
ed during the game; one for each team
fFisher and Barton carried oi! the
honors.

The daily Iowan says. “the Town
squad did not throw baskets well.
principally on account of the shape oi
the gymnasium which issquare and
not elongated like Iowa's." We have
heard that the shape of the court in-
terferred with team work but never
with basket throwing. We surmise
that it was the Grinnell team rather
than the shape or the gymnasium
which prevented Iowa from throwing
ba‘slrets.

Rarely has the gymnasium been so
crowded as on Thursday evening. The
gallery was ﬁlled as was a large part
oi the main iioor. It was a great lin-
ish to a season which has been very
sncoessinl in the min. The best of
feeling was displayed throughout the

oontest and both teams played a

pa»: lemztilly game.

The ﬁrst was by llelen Gode who

After the extempomneolls numbers.
the remainder of the program dealt
with the artists whose work is repre-

by Pearl Hart. This was followed by
a. ieview of Michael Angelo’s life and
work by Marie Lehman. Nell Sump-
Lel‘ spoke on Konbi and his Work, two
pieces of which are at present in the
college library. Van Dyclr, the noted

year. In the absence of Edna. Sears,
Bernice Whittier was appointed critic.
The programme next week will be in
the hands of the Seniors, with the
other class programmes in regular or

One of the most enjoyable programs
of the year was the Senior farce
“Apies Dix Ans“ given by the ’06
Ellis girls. Each member had the
privilege of bringing a mend, and the
room was well ﬁlled. The program be-
gan with a piano solo by Mrs. Sher-
man Sulser, and immediately aiter
the curtains parted on a pretty parlor
scene, discovering Edna Leyenberger
in the character of a widow, Mrs.
Solitaire, who had invited some of
her college friends of ten years before

for an informal tea and chat that
afternoon. The guests soon arrived
#Mlss Merrill who had become is
trained nurse, Miss Price lately come
north irom herscnthern Mission ﬁeld,
Miss Murphy a blushing bride of two
weeks, Miss Pryor private secretary
to the Governor oisouth Dakota. Miss
Peck a successful and “ Miriam
Michelson” type of journalist, and
Ethel Hutchison who had married
the Duke of Diddlesex by her own un-
aided esertions. Each guesttold her
story over the tea cups taking occasion
to bringiu references to others and
the that closed with a college song in
which all ioined. The program was
ended witha song by Miss Suckow.
The programs were written on card
hoard cut in the loo triangle and int-
nislied very appropriate souvenirs of
a pleasant afternoon.
