HERE have been frequent com-
plaints of late that a large num-
ber of posters. books, om. mysteriously
disappear from the halls and various
other places. The poster Liend is al~
ways With us and sometimes his eager
ness gets the better of his honestl‘
and as nresult posters are tnlion beiore
any person hasit chance to see them
unless it be the party who placed the
placard there in the ﬁrst place. Such
(Lots deserve the most severe Condem-
nation amid the guilty parties have no
excuse to Direr. Posters inny he an
ornament Lo it student's room but
there are no looms so barren lu Grins
poll, that it booomos'necessaiy to take
posters before the event Mlvextisei’l
come; olr. It is all inliistlce to the
man who buys the posters and puts
them upmmd not only that, but it
shows than some people have lltLle re.
galdl‘or the rights of others. Such
actsitl'e entirely lacking in cuteness
and show ei-ery sign or vandalism.

As to the matter of books. etc, the
owners are abmt Its much to blame as
any one. The hulls are literally
strewn with books and if anyone is
affected with the habit, in is an easy
matterto pick up such things and
take them home. Such acts are no less
than stealing but the): some people
steal with the sums complacency that
they do everything also simply as a.
matter of course. The only remedy
seemsto be to lieepa sharp lookout
and perhaps the guilty parties can he

state ﬁeld meet last year and who was
disqualiﬁed from taking part in TODD

Iessionallsm. It is Said that Ames has
a man ultmsd Cooper who was thrown
out on the same grounds that )lcliean
