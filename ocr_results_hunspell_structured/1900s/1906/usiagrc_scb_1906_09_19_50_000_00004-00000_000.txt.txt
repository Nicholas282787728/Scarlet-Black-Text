been associated with productions ais-
tinguisnen for their aeenrntenees,
beauty and completeness Tlieseenery
ior the plays he has lieretoior-e pro
rlnced have been inorlels oi the neural
places where the notion is supposed to
have taken plaee. In Romeo and
Jilllet,\rliicli is Air, Owen's olierlng
mils season, :hls is particularly true.

The costumes this season will be oi
the most gorgeous description. The
Limeiii \vliicll Romeo antl Juliet is
laid was the mesh extravagnnn in the
way oi dress the world has ever seen.
This enables the costumer to give his
ianoyiull play. The artist engaged
tonesign the clothes for Romeo and
Juliet was given illscinctions to spare
no expense to make [his company one
oi the best costumed organizatio -
traveling. Colonial Friday Sept
