YESTERDAY'S CHAPEL TALK.

Professnr sronps Gives a Timely and
practical Discourse on the Reasonr
ahlcness ni Bible Study.

Just now the religious activiLy oi.

the College is centered in the arrange-
ment of Bible Study classes ior the
carrying out of the courses arranged
by the committees In addition to
the big anti successiul rallies held by
the two Associations on Thursday
night, the topic or yesterday's chapel
talk was along the same line and and-
ed great weight to the emphasis
already laid upon the value and
desirability or taking up such a
course oi study.

The speaker’s attitude tolivard the
suhiect includediour phases or points
oivlewirom which he analysed the
matter and showed wherein Bible
study was valuable.

In the ﬁrst place, it is an accepted
tact that there is inherent in man the
religious instinct and that it needs
only cultivation to make it ilonrish.
There are many other ways in which
this can be accomplished, but the
most satisiactory or all is systematic
Bible Study, because it brings one in
totoucli ivith the spiritual develop-
ment at others who have livedthrough
in greater detail lust what we must
experience, and because oi the quiet
and thoughtiul method employed

which makes the rcsultsoi the study'

more lasting.

Another point oi view is that oi the
biologist whose iesearohes liai-e taught
him that the individual lires over
arain in his early liie the successive

account or the human race and its
