The Programs and Events or the College
Literary Societies as Reviewed by
Scarlet and Black Reporters.

The Senior lustituters made no at-
tempt to depart. from the customary
conventional program asusuallypre-
sented by the upper classmeu. Not
that the program was ordinary in any
sense, but the Seniors demonstrated
the possibilities or serious el‘iorts,
when backed by ability, to iniuse in-
terest and novelty into numbers that
might have become monotonous,

J. A. Knowlton opened the program
with an oration on “England’s linem-
ployed.u This was careiully prepared
and well delivered and was an excel-
lent medium for revealing the recog-
nized ability of the author. A. B.
De lIaan read asailor's yarn entitled
“Billy” and n. 1, Gary gaveaviolin
number which were both well receiv-
ed. F. E. Stanton followed with a
well prepared and interesting paper
on “Bacteria and their Relation to
Disease." This is along Mr. Stanton‘s
specialline of study and was given a
thorough treatment. Some of the
“Nineteen Six rCirculnr Letters”
written E‘i’ol'fas read by E, H. Lisor
revealed the fact that Mr. Liscr was
the only Senior who had not become
famous. An original story by
w. A. Williams, a la Mr. Kipling,
entitled "The Etiquette or a
Mogul” and club swinging by ItJ.
Cary closed a very excellent pro-
gram. Next Wednesday the Insti-
tute will holda joint meeting with
the Colcogatlrian Society.
