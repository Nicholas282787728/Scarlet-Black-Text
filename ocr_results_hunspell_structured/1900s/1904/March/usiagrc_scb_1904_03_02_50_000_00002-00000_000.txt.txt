could have three weeks ago

"The real reason that the pin
was adopted at’tlie time was, that
upon carelul investigation not a
substantial objection seemed to be
raisetl. It certainly wasn't the
opinion when the pin '02 now
wears was adopted that such ti use
would lower the staiitliitl oi the
honor G, and that was a point
thoroughly considered, although
the result may be today that such
action coupled with other abuses
hasled to that result. It is not
impossible for ns to adopt a new
emblem tor the classl Idoti't be»

pin as it is today it it is the con
sensus of opinion properly ex
pressed that the practice is de
teriorating the honor G. If the
Athletic Union goes about the
matter in the right spirit and in
the proper manner it will receive
from all» parts encouragement
toward placing the honor G back
upon its high pedestal and it pos
sible exalting it many degrees"

True it is that something can be
said in defense of the action of the
class of tone. The constitution of
the Athletic Union contained at
the time the action was taken, not
asingle line Concerning; the quali-
ﬁcations for wearing the G; little
or no public disapproval was ex-

pressed, but a following or the
precedent sanctioned two years

ago has brought another senim
class to a course which is gen eralr

1v condemned by members of the

Union. And the class of {904 can

furnish no excuse for its action
aside from its own motives and the

fact that it is following an illustri

one example. The present seniors
