Alter
which was served by treshmen
girls, the intellectual part of the
evening's pleasure was introdtlccd
by toastinaster M c C and les 5.
Mr. Condit was ﬁrst called upon
to speak on the subject “Lavender
and Purple," He showed how
the two characteristics of the class
of 1904, extensity and intensity.
have been manilested in various
ways during the past four years.
All that Iowa College has accom-
plished in the past few years can
be traced directly or indirectly to
thc Lavender and Purple,

“The Strong Man” was tollowcd
through the year by Miss lturns
She closed one ol the stiongcst
toasts or the evening by an appeal
for purityinnthlctics. Thestrong
man should remember that he
must be ﬁrst of all a man.-

Miss Jaquith in the toast, “The
Social Lion," described the differ
ent kinds of social lions. She
showed that almost all of thc t‘llfs
tcrcnt species of iron are present
among us

Tile to tmaster next proposed
the toast, “Scarlet and Black." to
which Dr. Bradley responded.
These colors are symbols of some-
thing which is ot great signiﬁcance
tons. The attachmentofa person
to his class and college is of very
great importancct

On introducing ”The Grind”
Mr. Barnard was careful to state
that he was going to speak trom
observation. He provedthat "the
grind” was forced to that condi
tion by circumstances which he
could not control.

lVlr. Knowlton. in toasting “Yale
Bluc and White," suggested that
the seniors had not done every
thing. The sophomores, in loyalr
ty to their banners ot purity, sine
ccrity and devotion, will continue
the work.
