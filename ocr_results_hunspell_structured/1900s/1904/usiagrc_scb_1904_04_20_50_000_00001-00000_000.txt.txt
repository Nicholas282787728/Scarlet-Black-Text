practiced medicine as he near. The people thought him to be a
wizard, They thought him able in raisethedead " Livingstone and
his wife pushed into the iiildrrness; they were lost to clvllization; in
a few years his wife cited “Then the than who had never feared the
face of beast or foe, who had faced death countless times cried out,
stricken like a child, 'lﬂir the ﬁrst time in nly life I want to die.”

Still he pressed tnrward. On May i, [873 he was found dead on
his knees in the act of prayer. Says McDowell. "Such men as Live
ingstone constitute Cliristiatiity's last ansit-erto lieathenism. Chris-
tianity makes such men as this. This makes it worth while to send
Christianity to all the world."

Miss MILLERD LECTURES

A room full of interested listene
ers were present in Blair Hall
last night to listen to another of
the talks on Greek art by Miss
Millard. The discourse of the
hour was concerned exclusively
with the sculpture of the fourth
and ﬁfth centuries B. C. and a
number of views were projected
upon the screen, which afforded
a basis of comparison of one age
with aiioth Slides wele ex-
ltibltetl, illustrative of master-
pieces of the six great Hellenic
Sculptors.

TWO MORE TO DAVENPORT.

Visitors Wm Last Two Bull szes of
Practice Set‘ies.~Bad Weather
Monday.

Assisted by the loose and spa»
radic play of the varsity nine,
Davenport was able to take the
two last games of the series by
the scores of 4 t and 2546. A
great disappointment was meted
out to the local followers of the

sport in the ﬁnal game Man
afternoon, when after hammening~
out teii runs in the ﬁrst two inn»
ings, Grinnell went to pieces and
allowed their opponents to score

curate ﬁelding was mantle trchly‘
difﬁcult by tliehigh wind and cold

desultory play indulged in by
the locals. If it is wished to shat-
ter the affections of the baseball
going public, nothing more is
needed than another exhibition
of the same quality.

The game played on Saturday,
but for a weakening in the ﬁrst
inning when the leaguers ran in
three scores, was an even contest.
Fillmore made an enviable record
in the box, being credited with
