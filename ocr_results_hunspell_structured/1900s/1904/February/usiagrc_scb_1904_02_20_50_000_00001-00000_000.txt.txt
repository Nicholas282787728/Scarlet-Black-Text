JOHN T. MCCUTCHEON.

A Thousand or More Grinnellites Renew
Acquaintance with an Old Friend

To any who may wonder why
the cartoon [or tltc Daily Tribune
otSatin-day Feb. 20. in the year
of Grace [904 was obsolete by a
matter of \wenlyrfolll‘ hours be it
known that the Cartoonist of Chi
cugtr' greatest daily was out at
Gl rnell enterturning rn tht: most
agreeable and instructive manner
some elevcn or twelve hundred
patrons of the Iowa College Lecr
ttn-c Course and that John T. Mc-
Culcheorl was obliged to make a
cartoon for that date two days
before it was needed. A5 are
stllt tomorrow’s Tribune wlll be
of more interest than everto many
of the people who heard irom
the cartoonists' own lips his hu-
morous account of the secrets of
his art,

The lecture was given in the
Congregational church. owingto
the advantages possessed by that
auditorium over the Colonlal in
point of size and heating tacilities
and the presence of tlte largest
crowd that ever attended a Y. M.
C. A. Lecture showed the wisdom
of the change. Mr. McCutcheon
was thoroughly enjoyed by every
ONE.

The Cartoonist began hislecn
ttlre with a hlt of personal remir
nisccnce concerning his own col-
lege days. As Mr. McCutclieon
put it he had started lll some
course, he doesn't know now just
what its nature was except that it
contained a touch of mathematics
and that itdtdn’tsttit him. He
was lured therefor into the dc-
pai'lmcnt of Art where tltere were
lewcr of the subjects required
which he disliked and thus his
career as a cartoonist was begun
as a result of distaste lot trigono
mclry.

Having brought the audience
into a sympathetic frame of mind
by means ofa few [elicitous words
of introduction, the speaker pror
cceced to give some practical ilr
lustrations ofcartoonists’ methods

mere drawing or caricatures is

lroubles.a fact which was after-
