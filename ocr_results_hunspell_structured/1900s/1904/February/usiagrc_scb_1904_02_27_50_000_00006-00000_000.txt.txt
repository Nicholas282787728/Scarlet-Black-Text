THE CHILD 0F DESTINY.

History records the rise and fall of
nations. Its endless pages glow with
deeds- oi greatness and valor, But
preeminent in their greatness and
shining with unparalleled elitilgence
are the deeds of the nations’ greatest
men. Grecian annals relate to its the
exploits oi an Alexander, who led his
invincible phalanxcs to victory after
victory ilntil the civtli d world grov-
elecl at his feet. Roman chronicles
tell us of a Caesar who carried the
Roman Eagle from the English Cllﬂn'
ncl to the iertile valley oi the Nile,
and scattered to the (our wliids ol
heaven the language and customs oi
civilized Rome_ But if Grecian his-
tory points you to Alexander, and Ros

That man is Napoleon Bonaparte.
France had revolted, The despotic

the dclivereri \Vould France rise and

had produced a Charlemagne whose
name is a synonym oi greatness. ttich-
elieu and Mazarln were her oiishring
Once more was she to rise in her
majesty under the leadership at a
man whose standard ivas iaiv, wboss
creed was liberty, and whose iortune
was war. The boom ot Bonaparte's
gun was a signal ior order in long
distracted Paris; the proclamation oi
libel'Ly in long enslaved France. Her
loyal citizens straightened their burr
dened baclrs and assumed the role
and hearing or men, ready to iollow
their valieot leader through hardship,
misery and death.

Order ivas restored. Government
was reorganized. The public debt
was raised. France arose iroin her
degradation, washed irom her power»
tui hands the blood oi the revolution,
and prepared herseli ior the desperate
struggle which lay heiorc her. The
cry ior liberty had gone iarther than
the borders or France and penetrated
the gloom oi all Europe, animating
the peasant in his cotmge, shaking
the monarch upon his throne, Russia
with her teeming millions, England
with her men oi war, Germany, Aus-
tria, and Prussia resplendent in the
luxury oi the middle ages, swept
down upon France, the author oi their
distress, Their purpose was the res-
toration oi the Bourbons. Their intent
tion was the perpetuation oi their
thrones. But they reckoned without
their host. A man had arisen in
France. A genius had emanated irom
the isle oi Corsica. His birth place
was not a palace. His ancestors were
not oumhered among kings But his
tread was to shaltc the earth. and ere
the crowned heads which bore down
upon unprotected France could repose
in peace, his name would he landed
to the skies.

Each age has its greatest man. Up-
on the actions oi that man in the
most critical period rests the success
or iailiire oi its greatest project. Thus
it was with the age oi revolution. Lib-
erty and equality depended upon
France ior their establishment. France
relied upon her government ior hei-
prosperity. The government trusted
in the army ior its maintenance, Na;
poleon was the army's god. Had he
iailcd at this period, the crisis oi the
greatest age in history; had he swerv-
ed one iota iroin the plain path or
duty, or displayed ior one single mm
merit the trembling band oi a coward.
what would be the condition oi Eur-
ope today? But iailure was ioreign to

 

his vocabulary. Success, achievement
victory, were words, the signiﬁcance
oi which he knew so well.

lines against the armies oi ieudal

those terrible onslaughts He took a
ragged and haltstarved army, clothed
them with purpose, ied them with
hope. and led them to the conquest of
the most iertile plains oi Europe. He
won victory when deieat seemed in'
evitabls. He took cities which were
considered lmprcgnable. He deieated
armies which outnumbered him three
to one. He dethroned monarchs, es
tablished republics, and over the
heads oi a people whose weary loads
had well nigh dragged them down, he
unturled the banner oi liberty. There
may her silken iolds be seen today
an emblem oi patriotism and equality

How enviable was the position oi
France aiter the treaty oi Amiens. li
her armies had conquered Europe and
won victories in three continents: it
her soldiers were the bravest and her
leaders the most capable, her admin;
istration also equaled and excelled by

orators, her poets. ber painters, her
sculptors wore the leaders oi Euro
pean art. Her name was iearcd by
itlngs, hated by monarchs. and re-
spected by all nations. in war, in
politics, in literature, in science she
triumphed. And the genius which
had led her armies to victory now
guided the ship oi state to social, in;
dustrial, and .commerclal supremacy
