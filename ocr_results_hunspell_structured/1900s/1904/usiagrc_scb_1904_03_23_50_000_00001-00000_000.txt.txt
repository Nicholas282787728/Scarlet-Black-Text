THE DON H FOSTER CUP.

Trophy and conditions tor Winning
iii“ hos Never Been Won

A great deal or interest is to be
given the snpiiomoreirr,
dual meet to be held
23 by the fact that the wine
ning class will be the ﬁrst to
have its name cngravcd upon the
beautiful silver trophy donated
two years ago by Don H. Foster.
a former member of the class of
1902. The class dual of 1902 was
made one of tlie nlosl. exciting
that have ever been held because
of this same trophy, but as that
meet gave the almost impossibe
result ofa tie and since no class
dual meet was held last year ow-
ing to the heavy varsity schedule,
the cup is up again tor practically
the ﬁrst time. The conditions on
which the donation oi the cup
was made were as follows:

The name of the winning class
is to be engraved upon the cup
each year, and when one class or
the other shall have won the meet
for three successive years then the
prize becomes the permanent
property of that c'ass. Thus it it
is won successively three years by
the freshmen it is Eorcver a fresh-
man ﬁxture, each freshman class
leaving it tis a legacy to its suc-
ccssor, and should the sophomore
class for tliiec times demonstrate
its superior ability then will the
cup be the sophomore"

It is conﬁdently r. peeled that
a merry war will be waged ovci
the honor of being the ﬁrst to win
a prize which \tlll absorb the at

The ﬁnal basket bitll game he-
tween Giinncll and loll/1i, tilllch

old gold by the close score oi 23
to 19, This gives the university
the undisputed title to the state
championship, although their real
superiority is not so obvious to
those who have witnessed the con-
tests. The ﬁnal contest was thril-
lingly close throughout, there be-
ing but little to choose between
the two teams. It is at least in-
teresting to note the proportion of
fouls called on the two teams—

did the best work for Grinnell.
This game closed the season for
the local team and although the
banner position was not won, it
can he claimed that the team is
the best'that has represented the
scarlet and black in the history of
the sport. Alienviable record has
been made. only three defeats
having been registered: two by
iowa and one by Wisconsin.

Professor Noble called the atidi»

the ﬁrst speaker.

From the ﬁrst argument till the
closing rebuttal the debate wasin-
