aiATIaEE CONCERT.

The Chicago Symphony Orchestra,
under the leadership of Adolph Ros
enbecker, gave ilie tirst of the C(ll‘tl'
meticemerit Coiiceits of the Oratorio
Society Monday afternoon in the C07
loriial Theatre, The house was well
ﬁtted. the only vacant seals being
those in the second balccny, the best
seats in the hotrse for an orchestral
concert.

The program opened with the elite
real Lohengrin overture, Mr. Rosett-
becker interpreted the work admit ably,
making the nrost of the splendid string
section of his orchestra. Throughout
the program the excellence of the
strings, particularly or the ﬁrst violins
and the violorrcellos, wr: continually
in evidence. in the encore numbers
which the orchestra gave at both
afternoon and evening performances
the arrangements for string orchestra
were most delightfully given.

The brass section of the orchestra

' is decidedly iiiferior to the strings.
The trombones were singularly deﬁ'
cieiit in the Tschaikorvski symphony,
and in the ride of the Valkyries, and
the same criticism falls to the lot of
the trumpets. The horns were excele
lent, the wood wind satisfactory, but
not characterized by the delicacy and
liveliness that one would expect.

The‘chef d’oeuvre of the orchestral
part of the program wastlie Tschair
kowski symphony. Brit two move
ments of the symphony were given.
the ﬁrst and fourth movements being
omitted. 'l'hesecond movement, w ith
its lilting ryrhnt of ﬁve beats to the
measure. was not given with all the
grace that the music implies, and was
as a whole taken _ men hat tot) Slonie
ly. rteverthele ie beauties with which
it sparkles were appreciated by the
orchestra and audience alike. The
tltird movement of the symphony,
with its martial themes and its weird
Slavonic coloring, was given with a
fine spirit and with abundant dash and
brilliancy. This syirrpliony . ows iii
attractiveness as one treats it again and
again, and so great has its popularity
become in centers of orchestral inrisic
that critics are already putting up the
cry of “hackneyed” rrhenever it ap~
pears on a program. For its, at airy
rate, it is a long ways from being
hackneyed, and a repeated hearing
would be welcome.

with perhaps Mrs. Friibeck in the
lead. Mrs, Ftirbeck is simple and
charmingi iii her manner, her vorce i
fresh and rich. and she sings with
consummate feeling for the in 1nd
sirggestiveiiess of the music rrhiclr
she interprets. Both the arias she
sang wcreiewarded with several re»
calls from the audience.

Van Ooidt played the last inol
movements of the Br'uch coircerto iii
onnnor. Unlike too malty Violin-
isrs, \‘arr Oordl’s pI-giiig shows a
proper balance between techirical skill
and brains, and he has a \ arrioririt
of technical Skill. He draws a tone
which is beautiful but not large, and
.lie shows to best advantage in brile
liaiit work, such as the last movement
or the concerto and the Brahn Hunr
garian Dance \lthh he played to air
encore.

Mi. Cowper made rtrany friends
when he sang in Grinnell last year,
andrvas cordially greeted when he
came out to sing. He sang the aria
“Onarray, Awake. Belovet” by S.
Coleridge-Taylor, an aria which is a
great war horse among tenors just
now, and he sang it well,

E\’Er'\l.’\‘G CONCERT.

The program Monday evening rvas
a success front more than one stand
point. 5 Although is was a great disr
appoiirtrtieut not to he. the Frithjof
Saga 3 good substitution was made in
the miscellaneous program by the or-
chestia and soloists.

The music of the Frithiof Saga is,
if anything, nrore rich and grand than
that of Coleridge-'l'aylor’s Departure
of Hiawatha. There is a certain nor
ble quality in it that cart be expressed
better in a male than in a mixed
chorus and the solos of lngebarg and
Frithjof are very dramatic.

in place of this chorus, however,
which was omitted on account of the
failure to receive the orchestral parts,
Ea program was made up among the
‘soluists. Some or the numbers were
pieces given here at the festival last
year and tor that reason here more
appreciated by the audience. The
Cirrus Animam from Ro rtri's Stabat
Mater which w ‘ enjoyed so mttch
last year was repeated with fine etlect.
Mr. Cowper was at his best in this
song. He sings a B flat rvitli an ease
that charms a listener and his
mariner lacks all attectation.

Mr. Clark sang Valentine’s aria
front Faust and, as an encore, he
Evening Star from Wagner’s Tannr
liauser. Mr. Clark has rapidly been
gaining a reputation as one of the best
baritone singers in the country. By
many he is considered the best. It is
surely true that a better baritone
must have reached a high degree. of
culture. Mr. Clark makes a special
point of interpretation and is at his
best in German songs.

Mr. Wagner showed a remarkable

 

 

technique and a beautiful tone in his

The Ride of the Valkyries by the
orchestiareceived its due amount of
applause. it cannot be said however
that its rendition ir as an iiiipr'ovcnient
over last year. it had evrdenllr not
been pla_r ed recently ind \r as not dis-
tiiict and clean. For air encore they
played “Forget-me-nots," This was
the most ItiltStiCZtlij tendered piece of
the event and it as also one of the
most eiir’or ble.

'lhe chorus, arid Mr. Matlack as
conductor, quite covered themselves
with glory. The chorris work was
almost perfect and reﬂects great credit
upon the director, Mr. Matlack made
his debut as conductor of orchestra
and chorus arid acquitted himself like
a veteran. He has every reason to
feel gratified at his success.

ADDRESS TO CHRISTIAN ASSO-
CIATIONS.

The large audience that gathered at
the Congregational Church Sunday
night to hear the third number on the
Cortiiiterrcenient program was treated
to a discourse that will belong rememr
bered as one exceptionally entertain-
iiig', instructive arid elevating. Every
Christian Association nreniber there
went away with the feeling that the
Associations were fortunate in securing
Dr. White for this address. The ser-
irtort was preceded by the reading of
Scripture by Miss Davis, president of
the Y. W. C. A, a hymn by the con-
gregation and trvo anthems by the
choir. Dr. White was introduced by
Pres. W. K. Stacy, of the Y. M. C.
A., and he proceeded at once to the
heart of his subject by outlining the
distinction between individuality arid
true personality. The former quality
is universal and valuel but the lat
ter‘ is altogether lacking in marry peo
ple and classes LII'. White went on
to show that it is the pos ion of a
personality that mar s the develop
ment in the rrtre sen_ til the word,
A mart is a true titan it he knows hime

expet iertceamorig Japanese, Dr. White
showed that it was in this one particu-
lar that the Japanese lack. In the art
of the Flowery Kingdom, and the art
of a country is the exact exponent of
its ethical lite, there is no theme that
touches human souls. All paintings
arid poetry deal with Nature. 50 thor-
oughly out of Japanese lite is person-

need for them among the riaiiv .

SENIOR CHAPEL.

Owing to the absence of President
Bradley iii the east, Dean Main led
the senior chapel Friday morning”
Both the seniors and the faculty wore
caps arid gowns.

The 1902 class hymn was written
by Miss Constance Elizabeth Berry
and was sung to the trrrie of Louvan.

Dean Main spoke of our duty iii life
and to our fellow man. if the growing
principal of love iii man is the domie
iiaitt force, all systems will pass out of
