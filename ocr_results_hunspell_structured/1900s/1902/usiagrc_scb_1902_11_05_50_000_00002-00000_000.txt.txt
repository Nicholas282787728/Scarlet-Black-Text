Grinnell, icwa, Wednesday, Nov. 5, rgoz
’1’—

(Ebitoriul
Y seems as if Grinnell has sure-
ly taken a toothnll slunip.
But what of that? If winning
games were all that counted in
college athletics most of the teams
would be failures and most col-
leges would have nothing in their
athleiie records to be proud of.
Thethlngsthat count are the spirit
which athletic contests give the
school and the development which
the men gain. If the spirit can
stand defeat it is a healthy one,
We believe that Gl-innell has the
true sportsman’s spirit, which is a
game loser as well as an incentive
to Victory. It our teams lose
games, they need better support.
There is a suggestive word ol slang
which it is hoped Grinneii never
has or never will have use for. the
word “knocker.” It liasa very
deﬁnite meaning and if there is a
more contemptihlc spirit among
students than that of the man who
is an enthusiastic supporter of a
winning tcnni, but who can say
nothing too derogatory of the
team that loses. such a spirit isyet
to be discovered. When the tennis
lose is the time for all to pull to
gether and bear the defeat with
the team. And it a student hasn't
the nerve to support the losing
team boldly, then let him say
nothing. for silence is better than
“knocking."

NY students who think aY.

M. C, A. lecture course can
be run on good wishes should at
once see some inemlier otthe lectr
ure course committee and talk the
matter over. If after that he still
thinks it is unnecessary to give his
own support, we have nothing
more to say. but if he sees that
everyone should help a little. let
him do his share toward showing
the committee that a good course
will receive good support.

Christmas. The question for the
