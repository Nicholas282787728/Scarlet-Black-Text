DEBATE WITH CORNELL.

Negotiations ror Intercollegiate Debate
Progressing SatisfactorilymFirst
Debate to be Held in Grin-
hell in March.

Cornell has accepted Grinnell’s
challenge for an intercollegiate
debate and has submitted a com-
pact. The compact is to hold
for two years and the ﬁrst debate
will be held in Grinnell.

Grinnell submits the question
and the date of the debate will
probable be about the middle of
March. A meeting of the de-
bating union was held Monday
afternoon to consider this comv
pact. In was considered satis
factory except as to the section
regarding the time and method
of the debate. Section vrii as
submittedreads: “Each speaker
shall be allowed seventeen niiilr
utes, and each side shall be allowe
ed ﬁve minutes for rebuttal and
summary; the negative rcbuttal
following the last negative speech,
the afﬁrmative rebuttal closing
the debate.“ This is considered
an undesirable plan for the de-
bate, as it makes the contest in
effect a series of orations, com-
plate and almost independent,
while the rebuttal is but a small
and unimportant part oi the de»
bate. On the other hand the
greatest interest in the debate
and the opportunities tor the ex»
hibition of the ﬁnest debating
talent, are often in the rebuttal.
It is here that the keen contest
of mind with mind: is rate its best
and here the chances for enthuV
siastic work and quick thought
are most numerous. The system
by which each player has a some-
what shorter time for his original
speech, but
speech for rebuttal, makes the re-
buttal more important and better
serves the real purposeof a debate.
The compact will be completed
November 15th, when Cornell
will send a representative to con-
fer with the executive committee
of Grinncll's debating union.
Other arrangements will be made
as soon as possible,

Among the students there is a
general feeling of satisfaction at
the resumption of debating rela—
tions with Cornell. Thosc most

DR. STEINER COMING.

An Excellent Number November “7
Communication From Lecture
course CommitteeiTicket
Sale slow,

Next Tuesday, NJV. II, at the
Colonial will be held the second
number in the lecture course.
Dr. E. A. Steiner, the noted Aus~
trian scholar, will deliver his in
tensely interesting lecture; "On
The Trail of Tile Immigrant”.
Old students who heard Dr.
Steitlertwo years ago at the chapel
have been looking forward with
pleasurable anticipation to this
treat, and new students will know
what to expect when they read
words of praise ior Dr. Sternerin
the circular which comes out this
week. it is not sufﬁciently re-
alized that this lecture course is a
Y. M. C. A. enterprise, tor the
writer knows several members of
the Association who have not
patronized the course. It has
been stated in these columns be-
fore that we have been forced into
much greater expense tllan here-
tofore. We based our estimates
on the minimum seat sale of for~
mer years, though much to our
surprise the sale has tallen over a
hundred below that mark. Would
the members of the Y. M. C. A.
rather make up this deﬁciency
by patronizing the course now, or
would they prefer to raise the de-
ﬁcit at the end of the year?

The price of tickets for the re
maining iour numbers has been
placed at 81.25. Is the cheap
show going to drive out the ins
tellectual lecture? You tell.

MINNESOTA-GRINNELL GAME

outweighed forty pounds to

the big team of Minnesota by
The
played a plucky game but the
weight of the Minnesota line and
the ﬁeld
proved too much at a proposition.

Misfortune and illeluck played
havoc with the team. After the
ﬁrst play Evans was compelled to
leave and D,Smitll was injured
but not compelled to leave the
game until the second half. Be-
fore the Fiist half was over Welker
was out and Duck and Kiesel
were taken out in the second halt.
The fact that Grinnell held Ne—
braslta to I7 and that Nebraska
later defeated Minnesota was an
incentive to the gophers to put a
better team against Grinucll than
they employed against Nebraska.

Straight iootbail was played
throughout. In three Successive
plays Grinnell held and at times
when Benson and Milo Smith
threw the heavy Minnesota hacks
for losses the crowd cheered for
Grinnell. Successive marcnes to
their goal line by Minnesota tells
the story of the game.

Grinnell spirit and “never say
die" were fruitless in the unequal
struggle. it wasa trial oi pygmies
against giants and the brawn oi
the latter was superior to the
former.

Grinncll received every courtesy
from Minnesota. The Minnesota
men showed themselves gentle-
men in every respect.

Dr. Somers, '94, rciereed the
game and Phil. Allen of Chicago,
whose- ignorance of certain foot~
ball rules was surprising, was
umpire.
