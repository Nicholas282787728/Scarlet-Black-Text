THE DEBATE NEXT WEEK.

One week from tonight the in-
tercollegiate debate takes place,
and Grinnell’s debaters will re-
cord their hrst victory or again
go down in defeat. All the ar-
rangements are now made and
whether we win orlose, the debate
will be a success so far as Grinnell
is concerned. The judges will be:
of Red Oak,
judge Kinne, of Des Moines and
Judge Norval, of Nebraska, The
two former ate members of the
Iowa supreme court and the lat
ter of the
Nebraska.

The work of our team has al
ready been spoken of in these
columns. It seems to those who
are in a position to know that at
last the right system has been
found. in lormer years the de~
batingtearn \vascllosen by elec~
tion or preliminary and at the
close of the contest the debaters
scattered with little or no thought
for the following year, But now
a continuous system has been in»
augurated and as in football or
baseball there will be an organic
connection between
from year to year. The present
scrubs are receiving valuable
training ioi- next year's'Varsity.
itthis system is retained, along
with the spirit of work that has
characterizedtlie presentdebatcrs.
we believe that before long Grin-
nell will attain that position in
debating whichshe \VOn so long
ago in athletics
