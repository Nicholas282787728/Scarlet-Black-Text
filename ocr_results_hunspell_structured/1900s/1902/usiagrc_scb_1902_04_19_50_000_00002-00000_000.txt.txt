new Rinse AS TO GRADUATE
" WORK.

”Two iactlons' recently taken
byvbhe taculty will prove or inter
est to both students and alumni.
One, relatesto the giving of the
Master's degree. It was voted to
recommend that no more
resident candidates for ,thc Mas-
ter's degree he accepted, and that
those doing work now, be given
until January 1, i904, in which to
complete studies. Final
action on this, of course. Will have
to be taken by the board of trus-
tees, but there is no doubt that the
recommendation of the faculty
will be adopted Resident grade
uates may take the work as at
present. This will result in fewer
graduate students. but without
doubt the quality or the work rc-
quired will be higher. This is an-
other illustration ot the fact that
10th College stands for the best.

The other action, which is oi
more interest to the students, was
that abolishing thc system oi
group honors. After the present
year gloup honors' will not be
given. The usual account or these
honors will be omitted from the
new catalogue now in press.

SENIORS ENTERTAINED.

Mr. and Mrs Main delightfully
entertained the Seniors last even-
ing at their home on High street.
A large number or the laculty
were present with their wives to
participate in the good time. The
evening spent in pleasant
intercourse in which the "
pig" played an important part.
As the evening progressed, re-
freshments were served the
dining room to a small number at
a time. Miss Glenna Smith kind-
ly favored the assembled guests

with a reading which was so well
received that she was compelled
to give one more to silence ap

too soon and is one that [902 will
