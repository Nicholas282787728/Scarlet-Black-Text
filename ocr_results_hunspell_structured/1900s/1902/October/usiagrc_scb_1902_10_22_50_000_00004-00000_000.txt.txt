THE CIRCULARS our.

The ﬁrst number oi volume two
of the Iowa College Circulars was
issued the ﬁrst of this week. Ber
sides the usual statistics, directory,
terms of admission, andother mats
ters of information, the Circular
contains three interesting articles.
The ﬁrst is by Professor Nollen on
the College and University in the
Middle West, in which he traces
the rise and growth of collegiate
institutions, the general standard
of work done and the constant im-
provement of this standard. Pros
tessor Main has written the second
article on Athletes as Students, in
which he shows the difﬁculty of
comparisons,butcomestothe con-
clusion that athletics has brought
an important and useful element
into college life, and has done a
great deal of good in giving the
students the vitality necessary for
a course of severe study.

The last article is entitled, A
Plan for Shortening the College
Course. It is a discussion of the
plan for a three years course, used
zit Harvard and Bowdom, and is
simply the plan orraising entrance
requirements, Followingtllisthe
writer considers the plan of Presir
dent Hyde of Bowdoin, in which
quality as well as quantity of work
done shall count toward winning
the Bachelor’sdegree. Eitherplan
is more easily adapted to condir
tions in the East than in the West
on account of the difference in
the work done by western high
schools and the difference in prep
aration of western students on ens
tering college.

HIGH SCHOOL GAMES.

Those who attended the game
between the Grinnell high school
and Ottumwa high school elevens
last Saturday saw a rather one
sidcdgame, but one not without
interest from a spectator's stand
point. The Grinncll boys were
ableto score at \Vlll and made a

 

touch clown after seven minutes
of play, Occasionally a Grinnell
man would get the ball at the
kicksoﬁ and run the entire length
of the ﬁeld for atouch down.
The Ottumwa boys were a plucky
lot and played a clean game.
They were better in offense than
defense but did not have the ball
much of the time. Sears and
Gilley did the star playing for
Grinnell. The ﬁnal score was 75
to o in Grinnell's favor.
