DR. TAYLOR'S ADDRESS.
(Continued llolli First Page.)

somewhat of the nature of a con-
ferenceibut none the less inter-
esting because of that. Dr. Tay-
lor discusscd the unity of tile
Christian life, and the fatality of
having different standards for the
inner and outer lives. This meet-
ing continued until time for the
vcsper service, where Dr. Taylor
again spoke. The subject for this
address was the “Call to an Occu-
pation.“ The lines of tvork dis-
cussed included the ministrv,
teaching. social settlement work,
and other forms of social service.

The last scrvicc of the day was
held in the Congregational church
at seven o'clock. A stereopticon
lecture on social settlement work,
with special reference to the Chi»
cago Commons, was given. The
Commons was established by Dr.
Taylor eight years ago, and in
this time has had a remarkable
development. Abuildinqcosting
565.000 is now the home of the
settlement. but even this is not
large enough to accommodate the
people who wish to make use of
it.

Large audiences greeted Dr,
Taylor at all of these meetings.
He has a large place in the hearts
of Grinnell people, who will great-
ly appreciatethc privilegeofliear-
him again.

SENIORS ENTERTATNED AT A

DINNER PARTY.

Last Saturday evening the Sens
ior class was permitted to spend
one morepleasanteveningthrough
the hospitality of Miss Ella Meli-
lin at her home on Fourth avenue.
Thc evening’s entertainment con»
sisted of an elaborate dinner, fol-
lowed by a period of happy social
intercourse for which 1902 is so
famous. Partners for the table
were found by matching dolls se-
lected by the guests as they ar-
rived, in the selection of which as
regards costumes and styles the
masculine element particularly
distinguished itself. The justice
done the various courses of the
meal was ample demonstration of
their excellent quality. The pm-
gress of the meal was enlivened

 

by the music at a gramophone.
which was also called into requisi-
tion during the remaining part of
the evening. The kindly hospitals
ity of the hostess and thejovial
senior spirit made the evening a
most enjoyable one.

w, S. LACEY COMING.

Mr. W. s, Lacey, general sec-
retary of the Y. M. C. A. at Oslczl-
[0053. will speak to the men of the
college ill Institute hall tomorrow
evening at 6:30. Mr. Lacey has
been active in the Y. M, C. A. cir
cles oi Iowa tora number of years
and will be remembered as a
former member of the state Y, M
C, A, male quill'lcl.

When Mr. Laccy assumed the
posttion of secretary at Oskar
loosa, the organization was in a
very piccill'lous condition. The
facilities with which he had to
work were extremely limited and
the ﬁeld was indeed a discourag-
ing one, but by dint of hard and
untiring cltorts Mr, Lacey has
gradually brought the Osltaloosa
Y. M. C, A. to a point where it is
one of the strongest organizations
in the state. Through his inﬂu-
ence the business men have don»
ated a building site and $40.00!)
with which to erect a Y. M. C. A.
Auditorium.

in puhlic speaking, as in all his
other work, the secret of M r,
Lacey’s inﬂuence over men lies
in his intense earnestness; no one
should miss the opportunity to
hear him. An interesting feature
oltlte meeting will be the special
m usi c by the College Male
Quartet.
