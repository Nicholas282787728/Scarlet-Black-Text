New Series,

IOWA vs. GRINNELL.

Good Game at Ball on a Bad Field—
Wet Field and High Wind
Cause Many Errors.

The ﬁrst game on the newAdia-
mond in Ward Field was played
with the old rivalilowa. The rain
of the night before left the ﬁeld
heavy and a strong northwest wind
made the negotiation of tires an
uncertain matter. Iowa went to
batﬁrstandnettedtworuns. Grin-
nell evened up things in her half.
In the second inning Iowa had the
bases ﬁlled but failed to score
Grinnell also failed to Score. In
the third Iowa drew a blank, while
King scored for Grinnell. Iowa's
attemptsto reach ﬁrst in the lourtli
were futile. The best Grinnell
coulddowastoreachsecond. Iowa
landed two tallies in the ﬁlth and
Clark pounded out the ﬁrst two
baggcr ofthe game but failed to
reach home,

In the sixth neither side scored.
Through poor ﬁelding and wild
throwing, Iowa landed 3 in the
seventh. Grinnellstarted her half
at a lively clip but only landed
onescore. Iowa landed one in the
eighth. Grinnell had bases full
and one out but failed to score.
Iowa failed to score in the ninth
and Grinnell was forced ,to yield
the game to Iowa by a score ot s
to 4,

King was effective in the box
for Grinnell and pitched a steady
game. Grinncll'sbattingwasgood
but the hits were scattered. If
Grinnell can overcome her (lispor
sition to go in the air at critical
moments, the prospects for a wine
ning team are excellent.

ADDITION TO UNCLE SAM’S CLUB
PROGRAM.

The publication of the program
to be given next Monday evening
at the Colonial Tlicatie in the luv

tercsts of Uncle Sam's Club is
sufficient to itssuie everyone an
evening of proﬁtable entertain-
merit. In addition to the program
as published, plans tor the club
house, which the committee have
received from Architect Taylor,
'85,olCedar Rapids, willbeshown
by stereopticon and constitute a
very interesting number of the
program. This cause should be
suppoited by every student and
every citizen of Grinncll. It
means your part in matting better
Americans and better citl7enship.

essential points and has led to

obtained, Every precaution has
been taken to guard against sur-
prise by Washburn on obscure
points and to avoid any over or
under-emphasis of tacts by Grin-
nell.

Whether the debate is lost or
won, it is believed that it marks
the beginning of a new era in Grine
nell debating, Never before has
the matter been taken tip in such
athoroughlysystematicway. The
real success or failure of the dee
bate does not lie in the gaining of
the decision ot the judges next
Wednesday evening, but in arous-
ing such an enthusiasm among the
students that next year the debate
shall be worth the same effort and
shall receive the united support ot
the institution. It is Grinnell that
we are backing in this debate, as
well as in football games, and this
is a good place to show college
patriotism, for encouragement is
worth more to a mani stinging un-
der the memory of former defeats,
than to one riding on the top wave
oi success. The way to begin
showing this spirit is by attending
the mass meeting Tuesday after-
noon at 4:15 in the chapel and
showing the men on the team that
they have the college behind them
in their effort to win honor for the
scarlet and black.

VIEWS OF LAKE GENEVA.

A little glimpse of social life at
Lake Geneva during the Student
Conterence was given to the stu-
dents last Thursday in a stereopti»
con lecture. The views. although
well chosen for such it lecture, did
not present an adequate idea ot
the beauties of Lake Geneva, but
served to supplement the interest-
ing tallt of Mr. Nollen,

In the course of the lecture Mr.
Nollen presented the work done
there and made an earnest plea
for a larger delegation from Iowa
College. Suchconterencesotthe
western college men are of value
because of the exchange of ideas
and the renewed inspiration for
Y. Mi C A. work. After such a
report as Mr. Nollen gave, Iowa
College ought to have a large
delegation at the conference next
summer.and begreatlyencouragcd
for the further progress ot Y. M.
C. A. work here.
