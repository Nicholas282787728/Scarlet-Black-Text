WORD or warning to those

who are responsihle is op-
portune with regard to the paste
ing of bills for advertising pure
poses. Much to the annoyance
of many oftlie townspeople, the
trees along the streets have been
pretty well covered with posters
during the last week. For r
which need not be given
these are very objectionable to
those who have a genuine nrrtle
in the appearance of the tonl’l.
Largely through the efforts ol

Exepresident Gates, when he has ,

here, the various signs and advcrr’
tisements were removed from the
trees and telephone poles, anrl
since then the town has been
comparatively free from any
thing otthis kind. At present,
however, there seems to he a
tendency. the students

habit. It is safe to my that this

ordinance against it in the near-
future. We have it ﬁrst hand

counci1,tllntztil ordinance will be
introduced soon. and there is no
reason to think that it will not be
adopted. All will aglec, no he.

to do. The students llllCl’r
