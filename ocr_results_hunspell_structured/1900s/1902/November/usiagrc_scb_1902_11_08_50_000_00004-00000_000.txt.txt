DR. BRADLEY'S ADDRESS,

Thursday evening President
Bradley spoke to the Y. M. c. A.
on Missions. Dr, Bradley is a
member of the American Board
of Commissioners of Foreign
Missions which expends many
hundreds of thousands of dollars
annually in missionary efforts:
Its missionaries do not go to
foreign ﬁelds to force creeds upon
others and their work is more in
the nature 'of socral settlement
work than the teachingot religious
doctrines. The American board
supports a large number of min
isters and physicians in t'oreign
lands, whose earliest duties are
often the instruction in tile ﬁrst
principles of morality, cleanliness
and sanltation. Every mission
station requires a different course
of action for the peoples among
whom the missionaries work,
range from the savages of Africa
to the Spanish Catholics and the
highly civllized people or Japan.
Often the missionary can only set
up higher standards of morality
and religion or of intellectual culr
ture as where time and work and
money are spent in establishing
schools and colleges.

ﬁrst one and will contain several
good stories, some verse and an
interesting article under the
"Stray Leaves" department. The
management of 70p Um't this
year is making agreat effort to
give the students and friends of
Iowa College a magazine which
is readable and attractive To do
this it is necessary that the stu
dents should show their interest
in the magazine, not only subs
scribing but writing something
for it. The function of the magas
zine is to furnish an opportunity
for the expression ot the literary
life of the college. Obviously it
cannot perform this function if
only the editors write for it, in
which case the students have only
themselves to blame

The management is notcompet
ing with Hay/tum or SU‘MILL’VS.
but if you take the trouble tolook
at the college publications on the
exchange table in the library you

will ﬁnd that Mr Um) compares
very favorably with the literary
productions at msny Universities.

In about three weeks the ora-

secretary. Go \vithtlie same spirit
into your orntions as our athletic
teams have gone into games
and there will be a surprising and
favorable result. The productions
