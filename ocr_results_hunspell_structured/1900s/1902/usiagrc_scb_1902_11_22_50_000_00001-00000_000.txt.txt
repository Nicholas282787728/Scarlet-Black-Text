THANKSGIVING GAME.

A Large Crowd Expected to Take Ad-
vantage or Low Rate for Drake

Game.

There is a general feeling that
the game tvith Drake next Thurs-

day will be one of the hardest of
the season for the Giinnell team,
but there is also a very noticeable
air of determination among the
students and team that this game
must be won. Just how great a
factor this determination will
prove to be it is pretty hard for
us to conjecture at present, but no
one who was at the mass meeting
before the Cornell game and who
saw the game the next day will
deny the value of that very same
spirit in winning the contest with
the Methodists, in previous years
we have always round Drake a
much harder proposition than
Cornell, but this year the sudden
rise, in holding Chicago to such a
low score, and in defeating Ames
and Drake. gave good reason for
our apprehensions, and it is hard
Iy an exaggeration to say that
Grinnell surprised herself in wine
ning a game which had been cone
ceded to Cornell by critics all
over the state.

it is now tip to Iowa College to
give the critics another shock, to

show that the brace taken by tlic‘

Grinnell icani is genuine, and that
the victory over Cornell was no
accident, The team has made
very decirlctl improvement and it
is very greatly ericourirgcd by the
support shown by the students
when it evident that they
were about to play a losing game.
Comparative scores :er vcry llll'
satisfactory, and although Cornell
succeeded in defeating Drake. it
is very probable that Drake will
put upa much stiffer game against
Grinnell than site did against Cor-
nell Another factor in Drake's
iavor will be the rooting of the
whole school from the bleachers.
Griiinell can always depend upon
good hearty support from a large
contingent ot Des Moines people,
but this does not lessen the
obligation of every Grinnell stuv
dent, who can possibly do so. to
go and root for the team.

A round trip rate of “so has
been secured, the tickets being
good until Monday.

IN A PERSIAN GARDEN

interesting Concert and Recital Next
Tuesday Evening at the chapel.

The work to be presented at the
concert Tuesday evening, “Ina
Persian Garden," by Liza Leh-
inann, is many respects the
most unique and interesting pro-
duction that has appeared in the
musical world in the last decade.
lts subject mattcris entirely novel,
consisting of a selection or thirty-
one stanzas from the Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam. its text con-
tains no plot. nor is there any
logicalunfoldingof anidea;butthe
stanzas of the "Persian Garden”
like those of the larger tvork from
which it is drawn, form a series of
meditations on the phenomena of
Life and Death; each stanza is
complete in itself. and has no
organic connection with its nelglr
bors.

Fitzgerald's translation of the
Rubaiyat, from which the Persian
Garden istaken, is full of Oriental
imagery and local color, and in
setting the stanzas to music the
composer has taken full advante
age of these elements. One of
the stri ’ng features of the music
isthc importance of the piano»
forte accompaniment. The ac
comptrniirrcnt is elaborated so
fully that it affords in itself. uith-
out the addition of the words and
the Volcth’. a cmnpll‘te musical
work of rare beauty.

Dr. Steiner's name has been
suggested in several ways and
most of the members of the come
mittee of the trustees which have
the matter in hand,have express
ed themselves as very favorable
to Mr. Steiner's experience asa
pastor, and his practical work
along sociological lines give him
thorough preparation tor hrs
duties. His enthusiasm for the
work which aids in improving
sacral conditions and his potter
as shown by what he has accom-
plished irt the past, recommend
him strongly asa man who will
add sti-cngth to the college face
ultand bca welcome addition
to the community. No deﬁnite
action has yet been taken and the
meeting of the trtistccs does not
occur until February, but it seems
very liltcly that the trustees as a
