E wish to call the attention
of the students again to the
prize uttered by the Unit manager
ment tor'the best college song.
According to'the terms of the con
testonly a month remains in which
the songs may be submitted. A
rousing Grinnell song to be renr
dered tor the ﬁrst time at the come
mencement exercises, w o u l d
add not a little to the interest of
that occasion. Some one has the
opportunity to give himself an im-
mortal name so far as Grinnell is
concerned, by producing a real
Grinnell song.

ANY comments concerning

Dr. Bradley's coming to
Grinnell have appeared in' the
newspapers, and all have spoken
or him in the highest terms. one
of the Grand Rapids papers,
speaking of Dr. Bradley's departr
urc, states its opinions in the [ole
lowing words: ~-One‘oi the most
genial and approachable of men,
he numbers his personal friends
not by hundreds only but by
thousands, During the ten years
of his pastorate here he has had
ample time to become identiﬁed
with the city’s lite, and be it said
to his credit, he has improved tllis
opportunity to the tull. Not only
has the immediate work under his
hand prospered, but in the midst
of a large and exacting pastorate
he has round time to take part in
almost every movement that
stands for the welfare and up—
huilding of Grand Rapids. A man
of wide scholarship, incisive
speech, catholic spirit, fraternal
disposition, sunny temperament
indomitableenergy,his going from
our midst will seem to most of us
'somethinginthe nature of a public
calamity. It will be a long time
before his place is exactly ﬁlled,
no matter how talented his sues

cessors may be.”
