BASKET BALL TEAMS AT DES
MDINES.

No particulars have been learned
concerning last night's basketball
gameut Highland Park. Tlieteam.
consisting of Capt. McKeag. Fil|~
more. Cole, Wilson, Homer Clark,
Van Hoesen and Belden, the last
named as substitutes, left yester-
day at 2:30 for Des Moines. It
will be noted that tllis lineriip is
the regular one for the college
team. An account of tonight's
game with the Y. M. C. A. will be
given in our next issue. Basket
ball is the Y. M. C. A.’s long suit
and no one expects but that the
contest with the team that repier
sents it will be anything but a
battle royal.

Of scarcely less interest to Grins
neii people will be the return game
that the Academy plays there to-
day with the West Des Moines
high school. Witli the advantage
or playing befote an audience ot
their own sympatirizers and on
their own grounds the West High
School will undoubtedly be a much
harder proposition than when they
played here. SCARLET AND BLACK
goes to press too early to give the
result of the game.
