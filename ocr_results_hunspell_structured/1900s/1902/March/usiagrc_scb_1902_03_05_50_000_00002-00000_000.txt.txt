Grinnell, Iowa, Wednesday, March 5, [901

(‘Ebitori n1

HERE was no class of peer

pie in Grinnell that was

more pleased over the building ol
the elegant new Colonial Theatre
than the students in the college,
and there is no body of people in
Grinnell who will patronize it
more treely, in proportion to their
means, than these same students;
providing, of course, that the
‘management of the theatre sc-
cures plays that are worth seeing.
The need oi a respectable play
house has long been ielt in Grin-
nell. With the opening of the
new building. it was believed
that tlils need had been supplied,
and that beginning with this gen
eration of students, the, people of
Grinnell would havcopportiinities
to hear ﬁrsteclass dramas, and
that in this community, at least,
the theatre would be made to
serve that high purpose. which it
fails to serve in so many instances,
It is a fair question to ask whether
that purpose is being realized,
and whether it is likely to be real-
ized ii the management continues
its present policy. Three weeks
ago, or. the night or February II,
occurred the opening performance
which was satisfactory in every
way, and encouraged people in
the belief that works of merit and
art would be presented, What
has followed? Two other plays
have already been presented, both
of which were extremely poor.
The fourth will be given tonight,
and if anything, is worse than the
two precedingr Three of the
ﬁrst tour plays are exceedingly
cheap and are not at all in hair-
mony with the assertions made

before the opening night. They
are not only low in tone but poor-
ly presented, and are not such as
willjustity the expending ot the
thousands that were necessary to
erect the new building. They
are far better suited to the old
opera house. Already the char-
acter of the plays is being quite
generally discussed among the
students, and we have yet to hear
a word in their support. if the
students' patronage is to be se-
cured. more respectable plays
must be given. In our opinion
the management would do well-to

take heed of this student senti-
ment because there is not the
slightest doubt that many of the
good people of Grinnell are of
ilie same opinion. We have had
it in mind to establish a column
in which critical reviews of the
different plays would be given
from time to time. but, unless
there is a decided change in the
quality of the plays. there can be
no justiﬁcation fol such a column
