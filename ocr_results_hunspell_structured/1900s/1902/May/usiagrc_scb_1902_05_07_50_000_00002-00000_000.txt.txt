all students who are not at-
; tending the Willett lectures
are missing some very instructive
talks. Dr. \Villett is one of the
leading Bible scholars at America
and delivers his addresses with
forcetintlcloquence. Thisis an ape
portnnity that will not Come again
soon, and every one who can
should take advantage or it, One
thing needs mention—41mm who
attend thelectures should be more
careful about coming on time and
thus avoid annoying both speaker
and audience.

only practically universal, but was
also admirably adapted to the use
of the orator and teacher. Lastly
there were the Jewish people,
scattered all over the Roman Em-

Mr. Wlllct is a man of pleasing
personality with a simple, yet
rapid and forceful delivery. His
lectures are given primarily

but to this he adds a reverential
spirit. Whether one is concerned
with religion or not, these lectures

will serve a May Luncheon in the

Rand Gynlnnslunl from ﬁve un-

it is hoped that a lar earnount willr

be raised in orderto send as large
a delegation as possrhle to the
conference next summer. This
system at a permanent tund is her
ing uscd satislactorily in other
colleges and there is no reason
why Gl-ianell should not start in

Everyone is invited to attend the
luncheon and thus help the As
