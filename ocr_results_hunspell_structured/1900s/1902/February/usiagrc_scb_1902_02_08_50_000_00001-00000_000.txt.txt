PRESIDENT BRADLEY COMIN

Will Be in Grinnell tora Few Days About
Wednesday, Februar xgthiAn
Informal Vi t.

Grinnell will soon have an op-
portunity to welcome her new
president, as he is to be with us
for a few days following Wednes-
day, Feb. 19th. This is good news
to students and townspeople alike,
as all are anxious to become ac-
quainted with Dr. Bradley. Hts
visit here will be a very short one,
covering but a few days at most
and will be entirely informal in its
nature. It cannot yet be deﬁnite-
ly determined when President
Bradley will come to make his
ﬁnal stay here, but that matter
will probably be settled during
his coming visit. It depends en-
tirely upon how soon he can close
up his affairs in Grand Rapids.
It is to be hoped it will be soon,
but in lieu or a permanent stay,
his coming vtsrt will be extremely
pleasing to all.

TALENTED WOMAN.

Mrs. Bertha Kunz Bakcra Truly Great
Woman»All should Hoar Hcr
Nert Friday Evening.

It is adit‘ﬁctilt matter to bring
before people a correct idea of
some one they have nevel licartl
Such a difﬁculty pres

nor seen.

sents when Mrs. Bertha

Kunz Baker is under dlscussion.
The half-dozen or so who have
heard her in the East await her
coming with the kecnest antici-
pations oipleasirre. To hear her-
once ls to admire her forever.
Hcr charming personality, lici-
dramatic genius and her noble
womanhood are factors which in-
ﬂuence the mostcrltical audiences
strongly in her favor. in none of
her work is she an impersonator.
She possesses a full appreciation
of the characters of the produc-
tion, and her interpretation brings
out their rhougnts. feelings anti
the motives of their actions with
a most convincing realism. With-
out a doubt. she is by far the
greatest woman in her line or
work ever heard in Glinnell.

In her engagement here on
Friday, Feb. 14th, she will render
eitller“Cyrano de Bergerac” or
“L’Aiglon,” both of which are
masterpieces from the hand oi
F ward R 0 st an d, the great
French dramatist. She brings to
her assistance none of the tricks
of the stage, no mannerisms,
nothing but her powerful persons
alily and sympathetic interpreter
lion. Wherever Mrs. Baker has
once appeared she is most ene
thusiastically welcomed upon her
return.

Leavingthe subject matter of
her recrtal entirely out of cone
sldcration, it is worth a great deal
to see and hear a woman who has
done as much tor her profession
as she has. Her evening here will
affold a most delighttul and
pleasing entertainment all
who hear hcr, and it may be
said, that all who fail to hear
her will ﬁnd when she is gone
that they have missed tlle Oppor»
tunity of hearing one of the great-
est and best women in hot line of
work, atruly great artist whose
efforts give nothing but the great-
est pleasure and satisfaction to
her audiences.
