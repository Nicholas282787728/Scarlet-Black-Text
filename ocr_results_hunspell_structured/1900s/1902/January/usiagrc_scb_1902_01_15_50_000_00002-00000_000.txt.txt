LL who are interested in the
educational development
of our state will join with the stu-
dents and faculties of the state in
stitutions. in the hope that the
legislature just assembled will
make liberal appropriations tor
their support. it is a melancholy
fact that the state of Iowa. which
has such an intelligent class of cit-
izens and boasts so much ovet its
educational privileges. has been
very niggardly in its support of
the state institutions. The whole
state has reason to be proud of its
University. for instance, but the
fact remains true, none the less,
that the University does not occur
py a place of power and inﬂuence
equal to that of Wisconsin. or
Michigan. or Minnesota. The
universities of these states have
not been handicapped by a lack
of funds. and have been able to
make rapid and constant progress
It the people of the state will give
adequate support there is no con-
ceivable reason why the University
at Iowa should not be as strong
as those of other states. With a
large surplus in the state treasury
it would seem that now is a good
timeto appropriate iundssurﬁcient
to meet the needs. At any rate
we join in the hope that this may
be done—not only for the Univerr
sity, but the Agricultural College
and State Normal as well.
