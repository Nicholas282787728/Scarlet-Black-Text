report that the poor corn
crop has hurt the attendence at
the University. Also we hear of
ﬁfty-seven candidates out for the.
tootball team, so the heavy rains
do not seem to have hurt the {cob

HE Glee club is one of the
best means ot advertising

Iowa College. In the world of
today any institution that sucr
ceeds against competition must
advertise in some way, The at
lention oi the public must be
gained and the glee club trip is a
pleasant and effective way of
gaining it. The regular exami-
nation tomorrow offers anyone
with lrgood voice and ear a chance
to learn a bit of music and to
help spread the name and fame of

the scarlet and black.
ON‘T forget that the game
with Drake, Saturday is
the ﬁrst hard game of the season
and that loyal support in this
game will mean- a great deal to

however an informal tournament

the state during the last year, and
it is to be hoped that the wave
has reached Grinnell. Tennis
a healthy outdoor sport and
Grinnell can support a live and
active association. Among the
women ofthe school sorneinterest
has always been ltept up, Tilt-
women's'coults on the campus
will soon be moved to the cottage
grounds and will no doubt be in
constant use.
