THE SCHOOL OF MUSIC ARTISTS’
RECITALS.

The School of Music hopes to
be instrumental in presenting to
the college and the community in

cal events during the year, in ad-
dition to the recitals given from
time to time by instructors and
students ofthe School. The best
artists that are within reach will be
‘brought here for these recitals,and
will be presented at the actual
cost of giving the recitals, Whats
ever surplus may be left over
trom any recital will be applied
to securing artists who otherwise

would be beyond our reach.

will be given singly. They could
be given more cheaply in a series,
but the newness of the situation
has made it seem best to try the
ﬁeld ﬁrst, and see to what extent
the public could be rclied upon to
support such an enterprise, bctorc
making promises whosc tulﬁllr
merit means disaster. Should the
patronage .of tlic recitals be as

may witness a strong and mill
iant series of rectials at a very
low cost.

The ﬁrst rccital will begiven by
Miss Esther Fee, Friday, Novem—

American woman whose violin
playing has captivated Paris, She
has spent the past ﬁve years in
study with the most eminent mas-
ters bl France, Marsick, Remy,
and l-Ienri Mdrteau. l-Ior Euro-
pean appearances have drawn
forth unstinted praise, and the
brilliant success of her coming

an entertainment attractive to a
large circle of hearers without be»

artistic. She will give a program

of the School of Music. and the
pieces it contains will be most int—

those who make no pretensions
toward musicianship

 

MORE ENTHUSIASM URGED,

A Revival or Interest is Neededistlong
Statement from an Alumnus,

The following communication
irorn an alumnus of the college
who is genuinely interested in our
athletic \vOlk, and who is thorr
oughly lamillar with our present
conditions, should receive the full
endorsement of every strident:

”The subject otstudelit support
of athletic teams is so trite that
further comment would be mi: of
place, were it not for the distress
ing lack otenthusiasm with which
Grinncll has been afﬂicted during

recent years. Iowa, Nebraska,

Minnesota and Wisconsin are able
to organize tremendous delega-
tions for out ot town games. while
Grinnell has trouble in making a
creditable showing at home games
in the matter of attendance and
rooting. For the beneﬁt of those
who think athletic enthusiasm has
too prominent a place in our colr
lege lite, let it be said that no lo-
calfootball game ever drew a hug-
er crowd than did the last inter-
collegiate tlcbatc held in Grinncll.

“With the Ames and .Simpsou
games in the near future, itis time
we were bcstirring ourselves
Don't let it be said that ‘15 or 20
rooters accompanied the team to
Ames.‘ or that ‘nearly 350 people
saw the Simpson~Grinne|l game:
Both contests will try the metal
of our eleven to the utmost, Let
us not only turn out in force btit
let there be ievived memories of
the good old days when ‘Speedy’
Rush and‘Cllerry’ Mullan used to
lead the rooting irorn the side
lines.

“For the beneﬁt ot the new stu~
dents it may be added that Grin-
nell expects her supporters to
‘root' with their throats and not
tin horns. It you are neithcr loy-
al enough to yell tor your own
team nor sufﬁciently courteous to
iespect the rights of opponents,
Grinnell doesn‘t need your sup
port. Such ‘rooters’do notbclong
to the present age but rather to
the era of ‘muclterism’ which. with
a few exceptions, lowa schools
have left in the misty past."

 

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS IN

THE ORATORICAL ASSO-
CIATION.

Movement on Foot to Rearganizc the
Association and Change the
Constitution.

There is a feeling on the part
of some of the students that gleat
improvement could be made in
the present method of conducting
the Iowa College Oratorical As-
sociation. Under the present
system or organization the asso-
ciation is maintained by the four
college literary societies, all mem-
bers of these someties being mem-
bersot the association. The only
qualiﬁcation required of those who
wish to compete in the annual tall
contest is that they be members
of a college literary society. No
preliminary contcstisheld. Three
prizes of twenty, ten and ﬁve dol-
lars are offered. Under this sys-
tem tlle association has gradually
deteriorated until at the present
time it is almost an impossibility
to get a quorum out to a business
meeting, an assertion which is
proven by the small attendance
at the business meeting last week.
Such being the state of affairs,
those who are interested in our
reputation among other colleges
have proposed that either some-
thing be done to revive the asso-
ciation or else give it up entirely
Those who favor its continuance
have proposed that the associa
tion be conducted in a manner
similar to that of the Debating
League, Under this system prc-
llminary contests would be held
in the different societies. the with
tiers ot ﬁrst and second places
being entitled to represent the
society at the interrsoclety contest
and the winners of the ﬁrst three
places in the interrsocicty contest
being entitled to represent the
college as orator and members ot
the delegation at the state associa

tion.

Those who favor the abolition
of the association maintain that
oratory is a thing of the past and
bring forward as proot of their
statement the tact that in many
colleges of our country oratorical
contests are no longerheld. They
claim that the work in debate,
and on the newspaper has largely
slipercedcd the work in oratory,
