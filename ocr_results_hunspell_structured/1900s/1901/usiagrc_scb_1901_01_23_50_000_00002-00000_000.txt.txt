HE quiet satisfaction, rvith
which the students look

upon the work of Professor Main.
as Acting-President, is very no
ticeable, and is indicative of the
good tvill and thorough respect
they have tor him. The relation
between Prof, Main and the stu-
dents in his classes has always
been one of mutual conﬁdence
