SIMPSON’S HOPES DASHED TO
THE GROUND.

Defeated by criiintll by score or 35 to o—
Five Touchdowns and n Flace-tict
Tell the Statye Simpson
Outclassed.

Accompanied by a band ot 150
routers. tlle Simpson football team
arrived in Grinnell Friday mornr
ing on a special train, determined
to demonstrate beyond the shad-
ow ofa doubt that they mtist be
considered a factor in Iowa foot~
ball championships. The same
delegation departed in the even
ing harboring the conviction, and
everyone else ﬁrmly convrnced,
that they did not count for so
much after all. It was not a walks
away for Grinnell by any means.
Throughout the entire game and
‘when the result was only a matter
of the si7e of the score, the visits
ors played the satire hard, coir
sistent football. They never quit,
The game was won in the ﬁrst few
minutes. Carried off her feet by
Grinnell’s ﬁerce onslaught, Simp—
son never seemed to entirely re-
cover, and although she did her
best, was never able to stem the
tide of battering rushes.

About six hundred people at
tended the game. The grand
stand, containing the ever-loyal
Grinnell girls, was a mass of mov-
ing scarlet and black. sufﬁciently
inspiring to nerve any team to its
best efforts. All Grinnell was in
gala attire, for the business men
had very thoughtfully decorated
their places of business with the
home colors and, in many cases,
not forgetting those of the visit-
ors. It was an ideal day for foot-
ball. What wind there was blew
straight from the south goal to
the north. Captain Fisk won the
toss and chose the south goal. At
3:15 Simpson kicked off and Claik
started the ball rolling by returns
ing the oval l5 yards. Grinnell
started her plays with a jump and
by their rapidity seemed to daze
her opponents, Every down nets
ted a pain. D. Evalls made 2
yards around light end; Lyrnarr
made two through left tackle, then
he covered 5 around left end;
D, Evans made 3 thluugh rrpht
tackle and did it so well

through right tackle for 3; Lyman

made 4 more, Evans 6, Clark 2%,

Grinllell's day.

Simpson kicked off and Grins
ncllagain heparrhcrmurch. When
Grinnell was ﬁnally fol‘cedto punt,
Simpson could make no gains and
in turn had to boot the oval. The
ball was quickly carried to the 30-
yard line and Flsk dropped back
to yards and tried fora placeekick,
misslng by only a few inches.
srmpson punted out and the Scar-
lct and Black team again pounded
through and over their opponents
for gainsof from one to ﬁve yards.
This time Fisk succeeded in his
attempt at a placerkick from the

Dul'lng the next ﬁve minutes
Simpson played the best ball she
put tip during the game. After
Fisk's 20 yard run around right
end on the old double pass, Simp-
son held for downs and forced
Clark to punt. A. Rogers tore
through the Grinnellline for to
yds. Grinnell was off side and
Simpson got lo more. Another
chalk line was crossed by the
Methodists to be followed by7
yards around right end. The line
was solid on the next trial, but
yielded 5 at the next attempt.
The guards back netted I yard

the 32 yd. line for a place kick,
The ball never left the ground,
tor Baggs, Moore, and Marsh
broke through and fought for its
possession. Glinnell nowresumcd
her snappy playing and without
a loss carried the ball down the
ﬁeld for atouch down and goal.
The succeeding plays were all in
Grinnell’s favor, Fisk failing in a
place Iti'ck just as time was called.
Score, Grinnell 17: Simpson 0.

ESTHER FEE’S VIOLIN RECITAL.

Esther Fee whose last appear-
was at the Trocadero
Paris, and whose nextappearance
but one is with the Paur Sym-
phony Orchestra in New York,
made her artistic debut in Ameri-
ca last night in Grinnell, and to
our everlasting shame be it said,
before an audience of ninetyrﬁvc
people.

Miss Fee fullﬁls even the extra-
vagant assertions of her Parisian
critics. Brilliancy and virtuosity
of the higher type might well
be expected in the disciple of the
French masters, but Miss Fee
adds to these faculties the greater
ones ot tonal breadth and richness,
and the greatest of all, true musi-
cal perception. Both in repertoire
and in execution she has acquired
a sufﬁcient amount of abandon
without breaking over into the
oizarre, that most baucful phase
of twentieth century music, Her
interpretations are full of elastici»
ty and life. Under the most ex~
asperating condition to whicha
player can be submitted, to-wit:
a lame, halt, and almost absolute
lyunsympatheticaccompaniment.
she lost neither her nerve nor her
temper, and may the good Angel
give her a very large white mark.
In justice to the accompanist it
must be said that she did not have
the numbers she was to play uns
til two days before the concert,
that she had never played with a
violin before, and that she worked
most industriously up till the time
of the recital, in the face of these
discouraging circumstances. But
itwas a most colossal piece of
folly on the manager's part to
suppose that an inexperienced
pianist could learn the Bruch cons
certo in two days. So we had to
forego the last movement of the
concerto, a part of thelast number
had to be omitted. and only the

sheer power of Miss Fee's play-
ing saved the recital from being a
Fiasco.
