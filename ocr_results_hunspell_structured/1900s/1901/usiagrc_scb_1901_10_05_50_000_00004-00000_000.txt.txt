FOOTBALL SITUATION TO DATE.

Drake Game To ght a Factor in Form
ing Estimate.

Our football team is off for Des
Moines. Tonight it will play the
ﬁrst Drake game and although
we may be disposed to rcgard
this as 3 pr easoii game we
surely will await ilie outcome
wttli a lively interest.

The football situation in Iowa.
tojudgc from rcpot . this year,
has gotten back upon its lornicr
basis. There Wlll bc a fuller and
more evenly matched ﬁeld ot bid
dcrs-tor the championship honors
than there has been for two years.
In other words the present in
dtcattons are that no one team in
the state will so tar otttrclass its
rivals that the results of its games
will be tot-cgone conclusions.

The results of tonight's game
will a: least furnish us and other
people another chance tor some
pat-isons and speculation asto our
prospects for the season. The
game will be played in the Audi
torium baseball park llndei'eleo
tric lights and with substantially
the sanic conditions as at last
year's game. This time the ﬁeld
will he more thoroughly lighted
than before although the attanger
ment. of lights last year left little
to be desired, the only confusion
arising when a high kick was
made and the ball would vanish
momentarily into darkness.

The Gl‘inell men will enter tlte
game in good (though not the
best) condition and every one of

them will last the entire game

barring accidents. our team \Vlll
depend upon quickness and team
work for its success. It is not an
aggregation of stars but of good
men who work together and in
this very reason iics our hope at
victory, not particularly in this
game, but in general. coach
Ttatt has already made his wot-it

felt in the manner of execution of
plays by improving tht- torntar
lions and order. However the
situation justiﬁes misgivtngs as
well as hopes as to the outcome
of tonight's game. As usual
Drake's team is El strong and
heavy one and will play its ctlse
tomai-y good football. Pelt,
Giaeser and Bliss, three at last
year's stats, are back at their old
positions and three of last year's
Panora team who are new to colr
Iege but thoroughly familiar with
football, will be found in Drake's
line.

Whatever the result of this
game may be the Scanner AND
BLACK sympathizcrs must not be
discouraged or unduly elated tor
it is the ﬁnish and not the start
that will count in a season of
football. l

on: FOR DES MDINES.

The 'Varsity football team, ac-
cnrnpanied by a good~sized or mud,
