(RECENTLY several institu»
tions have adopted the sys
tem of having one general maria»
ger to take charge of all of the atllr
letic organizations. Tile State
University adoptedthisplan ayear
or two ago, and Drake has also es
tablished the system. From all
reports; this sclleme has met with
genuine approval and has proven
advantageous in these institutions.
And now the question arises.would
this policy be beneﬁcial to Grin-
nell? Ill a measure it would, for
we have trcquently had examples
in the past of a clash between the
management of two organizations.
Certainly one great beneﬁt could
be derived, tor by having a gener-
al manager he could reconcile and
unity the different organizations.
We do not mean to cast any insin-
uations on either present or past

. managers, for it is no more, than
natural that each manager should
strive to do the best he can for
the organization he represents.

Spring Vacation Rumor.

A rumor is prevalent. and in
fact, the statement has even been
made in different papers. that
there would be no spring vacation
this year. itseemsthatthisrumor
is revived annually. We do not
know whether this is a mere mat
ter ot habit, or chance. but what
ever it may be, sufﬁce it to say
that this rumor has no foundation
whatever. Tlle matter has not
even been agitated. It is doubtiul
whether it would be advisable to
do away with the Easter vacation,
(or in recent years we have had
sufﬁcient examples to warrant its
need. without any vacation from
January until Juneitwould doubt-
less prove detrimental to the

health of some of the students.

The University of Colorado is
to build a Szoo,ooo gymnasium.
Tile roof will be built so that it
can be opened in sections, like
doors, and thus exercise can be
taken practically in the open air.
