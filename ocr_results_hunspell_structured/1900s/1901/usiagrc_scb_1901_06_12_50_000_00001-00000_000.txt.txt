The question l’llate asked is a pressing
and tremendously important one alwavs,
and a thinking man will never fail to ask
it when baﬂlctl in the presence of the
problems and mnumernblc contradic-
tions in life. Particularly will he urge it
when convinced of the restortng power
of a iriith which has worked itself out in
lils own heart, but which yet giving to the
lack of general acceptance is without
powerto exercise its healing inlllience
among men. Then it seems that trllth
in the abstract, or truth in the individual
soul, is one thing; while truth for prac-
tical purposes, or truth In sdciety, is quite
another. Then the man or the rvorld in
the skeptical spirit of Pilate may say,
“\Vhatistrulh?" There is ground {or
despair in this thought it we think but
superﬁclally, torrtsuggesls at ﬁrst that
it is impossible to stand {or anything
fundamental and vital in the actual
world, seeing that we cannot hope to
make actually effective in the world the
truth that has taken fast hold upon our
own sprrrts. Tht-re ariscs bcnceadis-
trust of absolute truth or ﬁnal truth and
one is oppressed \vithasenseof personal
weakness. Many a sad awakening comes
to the youth who goes out Into the world
with his college enthusiasm strong in
him and ﬁnds that he is Conlroiited with
whatseems to be a hopeless dilemma.
The obligation on the one hand, weighs
heavy upon him to cling to his high
ideals in spite OI the impossibility of cor-
ollntilig them with the actual conditions
he meets in the world._ 11' he hold fast
to these ideals he may. with some justice,
he called Uto tan and visionary. and
mcet with the allure that must always
come to him who lives in the realms of
idealism with no eﬁ’icient means or meth-
od at hand ot_making his ideal effective
in life. This is one horn ofthe dilemma.
The other is this, that he identityhimseit
with the standards or needs around him,

those astu|e over-wise men who ride
themselves on practical wisdom In at.
fairs, on their adaptability to the siti
tlon wltich is at hand, and who helptu
perpetuate it wltrlc they contribute noth.
Int: to progress toward a higher life.

The difﬁculty at this. point is the fail-
ure to realize fully the impotence oi trtlth
when separated Irom a vital organism
through which it may do its work. Truth
isaspirir. Itmrrst have a body. The
two must work together in ottr world. A
body without the spirit of truth in it is
worse than brutal. a truth without a
body is an mtangrble and practically urr.
real thing. Consider what the law of
gravitation would be without material
bodies. planets and suns, to act upon.
Eliminate the material from the universe
as We know it. and the spiritual law
passes into oblivion.

The knowledge of the law of gmvitn.
tion has been obtained by approaching
it through the medium of the material
things on which and in which it manifests
itself. The two things must be consid-
ered together liciorc one canhave a basis
tor a rational understanding of the gov-
erniugpr‘ruciplc. To constricr the ma-
tcrral as one thing apart, and the princi-
ple or the law as another tiitug apart,
would be worse than futile iWOllld Iic,
as a matterniiact, a practical impossi-
bility

This rs equally true in the humau
world, and is more important to keep in

The individual man is the energizing

the mass, the lenvemng element in the
lump. Suppose th ndividual conceives
atruth and proclaims it to the world.
However vital that truth may be, how
eversrgnmcant and needlul it may be
tor lite and forhuman happiness, it is
yet an unl'ruitful thing and will remain

However mighty the truth may be, and
however eager and enthusiastic its advo.
cates, it must await the dclibcrntc ac.
ceptance or those whom it is destined to
beneﬁt, Thetruth'must be in spiritual
harmonyr hthcm, beiore it can avail
to do them good.

A few men conceived the great thought
that human slavery is wrong. This
thought was conceived generations ago
and has been a commonplace of phlloso-
phy and religion Ior centuries. Yet it
had to take its time or lenvening. and
had to work itscltgmduallyrntotheso-
cial consciousness bciore it became prac»
tieally crtccrivc. It any one now should
gainsay the proposition that human slav-
cry is wrong it would seem to us like
turning back the dial oi time and advo-
cating a return to a state of harbarism.
But study a moment the history or that
thought in our own country. Its enuncia.
tion hardly more than a generation ago,
became the mall] or one of the greatest
tragediesenacted in human history. The
thought was lundamentally right btrt the
tragedy came because human society
was not in spiritual harmony with the
thought, In the course oftime emanci
pation came, The truth was established
and was reduced toa iormuiu among the
laws of our government. The slave was
given his liberty, The slave, however, is
not free and generations yetro come wrll
pass bciorc his complete emanctpation.

In the glorious springtime of youth a
man may battle vigorously for a truth,
only to grow old in despondency, having
found that after all the old world moves
on about as before. such is otten the
verdict or human visions as it reviews the
past. There is pathos irr this,a deep and
genuine pathos. A clear soulcd man has
a truth which his keenness of understand-
ing has grasped. To him it is so clear,
so ucediul, so vital for life, that the
thought comes to him that the world
must approve it it only it can bebrorrglrt
to know it. if he speak eloquently the
world will listen to him,but it must have
time bciprc it gives the ussenlot the will.
Truth must wait {or the world.

truth that has to do with the betterment
of human socicty, it is equally true or
physical truth, truth that has to do with
the material universe, A heroic man ap-
pears some time and says the world re-
volves around the sun. This perhaps
may be demonstrated as truth was never
dcmoustrarcd bciore, but tlle people will
take their time tor believing it, The
world with its people is a tremendous
th rg. “It moves stowlyandisuot soon
put out oi iramc " It awaits tor the can»
census oi oprnrorr, it awaits the assimilar
tion of truth, Meaurrlulc the world
moves on in its own way and a few lndlr
viduals may pay the penalty ior their
haste because they insist on telling the
truth to a generation not yet ready tor lt.

But the announcer oi truth is necessary
and is iundamcntal in the iuilcst sense
to progress. Only let him be willing to
wait. A company, an urgarrizruiorr, a
party, composed oi unreciprocaling and
spiritually uncongeninl people is chaos
and not cosmos. Rercrm parties. part s
of progress oi all kinds, are inspired n

,rhe ﬁrst place, by men, not men by part.

ies. A party can rerorm nothing unless
the purty itself has a moral couvrction
and is spiritually in harmonv, to some
extent at least, with the principle which
it wishes to enact. These principles mtrst
have worked themselves into the under.
standings ol the men composing the par-
ty and nrust reveal themselves pra‘etical-
ly in their lives as individuals. The truth
to be established mtrst have a living body
composed of the men seeking to estab-
lish rt. Tire most potent retormer is the
man who lives a principle and is content
to wait till it has trmc to vindicate rtscli.
He is willing to suffer it need be and be
put to the severest testot actual experi.
ence before expecting its acceptance.

I am trying to give you in these words,
my iriends. some suggestions Irom the
“gospel of patience," wherein is iaith and
courage, together with conﬁdence in the
ultimate good,

There is in the world a constant move.
merit toward pcriection, toward some far
off divine event. This is true both in the
physical uuivcrse and in the moral, To
the narrow and unpenetmting vision or
man this movement is slowiso slow in
{act that he sometimes fails to recognize
it at all, In this he may be pardoned
tor a timc,but there is no justiﬁcation for
conﬁrmed despoudcucy and misunder-
standing. Compare century with century
and measure all the stages of progress.
in that way we shall see the rate of ad
vancement. Ages and ages have been
required to make rlrrs wurkl habitable.
If we should comparelts condition today
with what its condition was ten years ago
we should not realize this. Thccompar.
ison would reveal no difference. 1 must
take a more extended view. It is only
by looking into the remote past and com-
paring age with age that the progress
irom low to high. from disorder to beau»
ty, can be noted and measured. There
is a star that iorlhousands ofyearshas
been called Polaris,the North Star. Some
thousands of years hence this will bea
misnomer because the star is moving

The ages multiply as we investigate: It

The men who labored beiorctlrcre.

thought that when the proclamationoi

was attained, It was a deep sorrow tor

simply merits in a grcnt drama which is
still in process or action. It s recounted
that In cs Russell Lowell compared the
enlhllsiasnls and promises hefole the war
with the railurcs and disappointments
and misunderstandings after it, and he.
came enraged at the unsteady and vac.
illating policy at the government, He

The human spi it cannot be iorccd to
grow. lt grows as the trees grow, and
the tlorvcrs. Wars and pnrtrcs cannot
change its nature, however much they
may intlucnce it temporarily. Wars may
change buuudaries and change social
systems, but they do not, they can not,
modify the human spirit except in ac»
cordance with the principles oirts normal
development. . The sublime principle
enunciated in the proclamation must wait
for the spirit oi the race to catch up.
Not till then will, or ought, its fruits to
become available in the fullest sense tor
the human racc. Even war cannot iorce
an idea into human heads and hearts,
I-Iurry is out of the question. The man
who sows today must not expect to reap
tomorrow. He who expects immediate
rewards. immediate results, is doomed to
disappointment.

Spinoza says that the only love that is
worth being called love, is that which
loves without expectation of u return.
Therein he expresses a proiolmd truth,
though at ﬁrst sight it seems to be un—
reasonable. The slowness attire return
in many cases supports his statement.
There is an immediate return to be sure,
but it is the reward |hat serving is iu it»
scli. It is the reward that devotion and
love collsecrate in the soul-shrines of him
that givcs expression to love and devo.
tron. This immediate personal result
contributes its part toward the elevating
otsocrety as a whole and making ready
the world [at the ultimate attainment of
our idealsian attainment which may he
deterred ior years and even tor centuries,

We must reckon wuir the past, with its
tendencies and traditions, and with the
present, whenever there is a new truth
or a new view or truth to proclaim. The
