Class Championship Game.

Tile spirit ot class rivalry en.
gendered by the preliminary
basket ball games reached its cul-
mination in the ﬁnal game be-
tween the Senior and Freshmen
teams attire gymnasium last Sat~
iirday alter-noon. The running
hack was ﬁlled with supporters of
thc two teams and the ﬁerce play:
ing moved them to repeated cheer-r
ing. For a few moments before
the game was called, Parks, Chase
and Williams entertained the
spectators by an exhibitionoiworlz
on the vaulting horse. When the
two teams lined up. the chances
tor victoly seemed brightest tor
the Seniors to the majority oi
the spectators. but the speed and
skill of the Freshmen soon revers
ed these opinions. Playing had
been in progress only tor a ten
moments before Fillmore threw a
basket [or the Freshmen. At the
start the honors were with the
Freshmen. and in spite of the de
termination oi their opponents,
they lrept things going their way
duringthe greater part otthe Cork
test. Peterson threw tivo baskets
from fouls which'were [allowed
by a basket trom a toul by Find
lay. Fouling on both sides was
very frequent. Fillmore threw a
basket which brought the unlock
ers to their feet. The half closed
with the score: Freshmen, 5;
Seniors, 2. Between the halves
Ross and Wall-eser pertormed
some difﬁcult ieatsin tumbling.

In the second half the Seniors
substituted Gleysteen for OHS.
Neither side was able to throw a
basket iii this hall with the excep-
llun oi one trom a tool by Fill-
moie.

The playing all through the
game was thi: iastest ever willie.
ed at Grlnnell. The‘nilnble Fl'Ls \-
nietl far excelled their heavier an-
tagonists both in team work and
basket throwing.
