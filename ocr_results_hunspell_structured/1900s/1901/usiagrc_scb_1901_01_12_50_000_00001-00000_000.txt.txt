May Festival.

Much has been said during the
fall ota proposed May Festival
in the spring. It is intended that
it shall become an annual event,
The proposed plan is as tollow.
To give three concerts on two
successive days—evening. alter-
noon and eveningiby the Clri~
cago Symphony orchcstr (ﬁity
per-tormers,) assisted by Teresa
Carreno, the wor ldtamous pianist,
ﬁve or six singers ot established
reputation and the Griitnell Ora»
torio society (seventy-ﬁve voices.)
The ﬁrst evening and tollowing
afternoon will be devoted to
orchestral music alone,and soloist
with orchestra; the ﬁtral concert
will be Mendelssohn's “Elijah,”
given by the Oratorio society with
tull orchestral accompaniment
and soloists. Madame Carreno
will play a concerto with orchesr
tra and a group o[ piano solos.
Tlle securing oi this pianist is a
bit of unexpected good tor-tune
and will prove a strong drawing
card,

The giving ot srrch a series or
Festival concerts will cost a very
large sum or money, and
magnitude and quality will with
out question be the ﬁnest musical
event in the history ot Grinnell.
It will be the ﬁrst time that a lull
grand orchestra has appeared in
Grinnell. and the Chicago Sym-
phony Orchestra tukes tanlc in
size and quality among the tour
or ﬁve great orchestras ot the
country. Carreno is considered
to be the ﬁnest living lady pianist,
a reputation which she has gained
both in Europe and America,
The ﬁnancial risk in such a large
undertaking is so great that no
deﬁnite contract can be made
with orchestra or soloist, unless
liberal local support, in the shape
of subscribers to the series, is in
sight. To ascertain deﬁnitely the
extent of this support, the town
will be thoroughly canvassed
within the next wcclc or ten days.
Single admission tickets will be
one dollarior each concert, but
sericS tickets for the whole Festi-
valithree coilccttsiwlll be sold
to subscribers for two dollars and
a quarter. Subscriber-s

Gymnasium Dedicated Just One
Year Ago.

just onc ycal' ago last night oer
curred a Cclcmony which marked
‘the closing Scene of a long lrst of
plans and struggles, reaching over
a series of years. It was only at
the cost oi considerable time,
money and perseverance, under
adverse circumstances, that the
Men's Gymnasium was able to be
dedicated on Jan i2, last, and
turned over to the use of the men
oi the institution. This step
marked an era not easily under-
stood by the presetit year’s influx
of new students. The older stu-
dents can remember the dusty,
cramped, ill-ventilated sweat box
under the Chapel, where torrncr
athletes prepared themselves for
coming contests; compared with
which the large ﬂoor space, e .
cellerrt apparatus, running track
and bathing l‘acrlilres of the new
gym seem perfection itself.

Although gymnasium classes
have been in operation less than
one year. excellent results are al»
ready noticed ilmoilgthe sltlden ,.
In the ﬁrst place, it is observed
that many are forming the habit
of taking systematic
daily,althoughrlrcrcquircdclu
meetbuttwicerrwcclt. If this hab-
it \\'lII be continued after the pres-
ent students have letl college. the
beneﬁt cart then be nothing but
permanent, and one object of the
gym will be achieved. Another
pleasing result noticed is that
genuine and capable gymnasts
are being produced. During re-
cent years long College has rather
lost interest in the Pentathlon
Contests. An observer who
knows, declares that some of
Grinnell’s athletes would make a
very creditable showing at Burr

lington, where the contest is held
this year, and is strongly in tavor
of having the college represented.
This speaks well tor the gynrna
srunr and the gymnasium director.
Any one doubting the excellence
and clﬁcicrrcy ot the gym, is in.
vited to occupy the visitors’ gal-
lery some Wednesday niternoon
between the hours of three and
six. Notice the number of stu-
dents there taking exercise, b -
sides being in it place of sociabilr
ity during the winter months.
One such visit will convince any.
one that the time, money and per
severance oi the trustees were
well spent.

Sickness at Ann Arbor.

On account otthe prevalence of
smallpox all over the state ot
Michigan, the university at Ann
Arbor has been undergoing a (tee
cidcd scare. Cases exist in 51
towns of the state. but so far, only
one has appeared at the univer
sity. Stringcnt measures, how-
ever, lrave been taken to prevent
aspread or the disease. All the
students who have not been vaccir
nated within the last month are
rtquired to undergo that preventa-
tive operation at the expense of
the institution, All gymnasium
work is suspended tor two weeks
on account of the case with which
the infection might be contracted
in the bathing departments. All
the other departments carry on
their work as usual. With the care
that is being taken it is hoped the
ltlilversity may escape a visitation
of the disease.

1901 Sleighing Party.

The snow which fell in such
abundance Wednesday, made it
impossible tor 190] toretrain ir-om
testivities on the second Friday
night of the term. Seven o'clock
was the time [or meeting at Blair
hall. Two |arge“bobs"\\leresoon
ﬁlled with a jolly crowd, From
the time of starting, tun was at a
lrrglr pitch. Sleigh bells enough
could not be proculed, so a large
hand bell served to distinguish one
load. Having ridden long enough,
the party went to the Reading
room of Goodnow hall, where a
time wasspcnt in games and dance
ing Virginia reel. The third star
tion was the dining room ot The
Met, where oyster-s never tasted
better.
Though the party was arranged

short time, it will be long
thought of, as an evening of great
merrimcnt.
