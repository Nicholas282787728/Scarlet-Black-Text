The Freshman Party,

' It seemed as it the elements
had leaguetl together yesterday
to prevent the Ficshnian party.
The snow was almost knee deep
llntlelfoot, and at night was still
falling fast. But it requires mote
than a snow storm to break up a
igou party and in spite oi the un-
favorable weatlier. between seven-
tyrﬁve and one hundred members
of the class assembled in the
Chiesto and Institute rooms, and
the evening was passed all the
more pleasantly because ot the
[act that it had rcqtiiied some
effort to get there.

The social committee had not
provided any special program tor-
the ‘eveniug's amusement and so
the company broke up into
groups or suitable size and played
various old fashioned games un-
til refreshments were announced.

0n cnioring the room each boy
had been given a slip of lavender
colored paper on which was
written in purple the name of
some bird or animal. The girls
were given corresponding slips
and the boys obtained their
partners for supper by ﬁnding the
girl on whose paper was written
the name of [her same animal as
he had on his. Atter supper the
time was spent in conversation.

All too soon the hands of the
clock pointed to the hour of
eleven, the chaperones, Miss
Millerd and Mr. Davis, departed,
and the evening of pleasure was
at an end.

Pertaining to Oratory.

The Iowa Collegiate Oratol'lcal
Association will hold its annual
contest at Mt. Pleasant the 28th
or this month. The mar-kings oi
the judges on thought and coin
position entitle the
eight colleges to compete in the
contest: Coe, Simpson, Parsons.

tlid not secure one ofthe eight
places is not the [unit of out tep-
resentative; lle (llLl his very best,
and lllat is all that can be asked
of anyone. Thisis Mi.G|eysteen's
ﬁrst year in college and it is not
to be expected that his thought
and composition would
that of uppel‘classmctL Further
more, the oration was his own
and he should be complimented
upon the high quality oi his work
lowa College has been at a di‘sadr
vantage in the State Oratorical
contest for the last iew years
from the fact that her upper class
men do not, as a rule, take an in
terest in oratoiieal work. Com-
posers of orations draw the most
of their material flom the sources
of history, and this fact alone
gives aJunior or Senior a great
advantage over a Freshman or
Sophomore. A good oratorniust
bcagood thinker, and wide ex-
perience in study is about the
only thing that will make the
latter ofa person. It is to be
hoped that the members oflhe
two upper classes Will give the
matter serious thought. For the
members of the two lower classes
there are only words oi praise. tor
it is they \vhotake the deepest in-
terest in our oratory.

Iowa College will send three
delegates to the state contest.
Mr. Kisser will respond to the
toast. "Freshman", at the annual
banquet, Mr. Will Brown will be
chairman oi the delegation and
lMt. Gleysieen will be the third

‘nleinber oi the delegation.
