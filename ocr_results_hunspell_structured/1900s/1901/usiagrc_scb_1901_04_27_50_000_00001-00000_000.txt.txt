Fannie Bloomfield Zcislcr.

The following sketch of Mr.

Zeislcr’s lite is taken from Baker's
Biographical Dictionary of Musicians: “She was bol'n in Bielitz,
Austrian Silesia, July [6, 1866; iii 1808 her parents went to America
and settled in Chicago. Her ﬁrst teachers were Bernhard Zielm and
Carl Wolrsolm; in [876 she had already appeared in public; in [878
she went to Leschetizky at Vienna, with whom she studied live years;
several concerts given in 1883 were highly successiul. From i333 to
r893 she appeared on the Ameiican ‘concert-stngc every season, play-
ing with all the prominent orchestras in the U. 5.; in 1893 she made
a pianistic tour-to Berlin, Vienna, Leipzig, Dresden, etc, her success
being so great that she was engaged for a longer tour in 1894195,
winning triumphs upon triumphs. 1n 1895396 she gave 50 concerts
in the U. 5., and in the autumn of 1897 made a tour of the Paciﬁc
coast with brilliant success. In the spring oi isns, a mirror in Great
Britain and France served to conﬁrm the unanimous vcrdict ot the
American and European press, that she is one of the greatest among
contemporary pianists."

The programs of the May Festival will be the ﬁnest and most
elaborate in the history of Gliilnell. Mrs. Zcislcr will play Tuesday

atternoon, May 14th.

The innior's part oi
the program was thengiven, and
from the time that the curtain
rose until the [our happy couples
were united around the overjoyed
ilVIdJUI' hallway. the attention of
the audience was ﬁxed upon the
scene of action. Considering the
time in which lhe actors had to
prepare the play, it was very well
rendered. Miss Scanlmon, as
Peggy, played her part as she ale
ways docsivery well. Miss Ruth
Brown, in the part of Wanda, a
young college girl in love with art,
and Miss Leitcli, in the part or»
Blanche. a young college girl dee
voted to literature, seemed very
much at home. while Miss Currie
as Amy, also a college girl devote
ed to the higher arts. had her part
well in hand and deserves special
mention. Mr. Silvius and Mr. Van
Dike, two young physicians who
were in love with Blanche and
Amy, proved themselves both
very good physicians and lovers.
Mr. Harris, as James the servant,
who was very much devoted to
Peggy, was masterofhis situation.
Mr. Chase. as Major R adway, was
well adapted to the character and
playeditaccordingly. MLLyman,
