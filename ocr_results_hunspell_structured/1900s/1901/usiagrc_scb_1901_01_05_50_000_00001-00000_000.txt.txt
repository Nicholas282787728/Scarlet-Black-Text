The Annual Fall Oratorlcal
Contest.

The friends of oratory in Iowa

College felt well paid for their la-.

 

bors in its behalf when they
glanced over the large audience
which had gathered in the college
chapel, Tuesday evening. Dec.18,
to hear the oratiotis of the annual
fall contest.

Mrs. McConnell and Miss
Thompson opened the program
with an instrumental duet. which
placed the audience in good
humor at once.

Mr. D. E. Crabb then delivered
his oration, entitled "Attica Wait~
ing,” Mr. Crabb held the atten—
tion of his audience well and his
delivery was a marked improve-
ment over that of last year.

“Arbitration and International
Justice” was the subject of T. Ris-
ser's oration. The subject was
well handled and showed much
preparation.

Mr. w. Brown also spoke upon
one of the leading issues atto—
clay, “American Imperialism.”
This is Mr. Brown’s ﬁrst attempt
at oratory and his success should
inspire'llim to further efforts. Folr
lowing the ﬁrst three orations, the
college quartette varied the pro-
gram by singing a college song
and responding to a heartyencore.

Mr. Louis Vanl’lousen took for
the subject of his oration, “The
Rise of Liberty." His delivery
was good and he was listened to
attentively.

“Oliver Cromwell” was the sub
ject of Mr. J. C. Gleysteen's ora-
tion. His delivery showed skill.
flil training and speaks well, both
for the ability of Mr. Glcystccn
and Mrs. Dr. Newman, his in-
structress.

Mr. Henry James spoke upon
one of the most vital questions oi
today. He treated the race prob-
lem in an oration entitled, “A Nan
tional Problem.” The quality of
Mr. James‘ work was highly com»
rnendable and Iowa College can
expect more of him in the future.

While the Judges on delivery
were preparing their‘decisions, the
audience was favored with music
by Mr. Fred Condit, Miss Rew,
and Miss Porterﬁeld.

Y. M. C. A. Notes.

In a letter from the Associa~
tion's missionary, Miss Brewer, an
urgent request is made for some
young lady who is a graduate oi
Iowa College to conic quickly to
the work at Sivas. Miss Brewer
asks the question, “Among all our
graduates, is there not one who,
like Isaiah. will hear ‘the voice of
the Lord saying.’ ‘Wllom shall I‘
send?” and will answer, ‘I-Iere am
I, send me.’ ”

The central thought of Mr. Fel~
lingliam's excellent talk to the
Association last term. was to
have the ambition to suffer for
anothers' sake. It is another way of
starting the new commandment of
Christ. ,

The text for the Mission Study
class for the winter term deals
with South America as a mission~
ary ﬁeld, Students are urged to
plan ior this work during the win.
ter term. If there is demand it is
possible Mott’sUEvaugelization oi
the World in this Generation"
will be again studied. Everystu-
dent should read Mr. Mott's book.

The Bible study committee are
organizing a fourth Class for Bible
study. This class will start at the
beginning oi the “Harmony of
the Gospels” and will attempt to
ﬁnish during the fall term next
year. All men in College or
Academy who ale interested in
this work are urged to see the
committee.
