Day of Prayer.

The mere fact that. in nearly all
the colleges of the land, the stue
dents, on the same day,r are held
ing services of a similar kind and
torasimilar purpose, makes the
observance of a day of prayer an
event of solemn interest. But
the interest which thus~naturally
centers inan'occasion ofthis kind,
is greatly increased by the pres
ence or some man who isespeclals
ly well ﬁtted to directthestudents
in these devotional meetings.
This has come to be a custom in
our own college, and each year
some one comes to us on that
day as the guest of the college.

This year Dr. W. Douglas Macs
kenzie of the Chicago Theologics
al Seminary was secured and had
charge of the services last Sunday.
Dr. Mackenzie was here, on the
same occasion. tour years ago,
and those who heard hrm at that
time were anticipating his second
visit with the greatest pleasure.

Unfortunately the bli .ard of
last Sunday was so severe, that
many could not attend; but in
spite of this the chapel was well
ﬁlled. Those who went to hear
a formal, intellectual address, no
doubt came away disappointed;
but those who went, expecting to
heara practical, helpful talk, one
that would help them in the days
to come, found just what they
wanted. The subject of Dr. Mac-
kenzie's discourse was “Power in
the Inward Man,” as described in
the second and third chapters of
Ephesians. Without going into
details, it may be said that a dis-
cussion of the relative importance
of the different powers of man as
compared with the power of the
inward, or spiritual man, served
as the basis of his remarks. The
power of the spirit, the power of

 

sin,ofself-wi|l, and ot habit, the
reality of the inner world: all reA
ceivedthespeaker’sattcntion,and
were treated in a most. helpiul and
satisfactory manner.

Immediately atter this service
the class prayer meetings were
held in the usual places.

In the attcrnoon, at tour o'clock
a‘special meeting tor the men of
the college was held in Institute
Hall. The remarks of Dr. Macs
kenzie, who led the meeting, were
greatly‘appreciatcd.

The meeting tor the women of
the college. held in Chrestomathi-
an Hall at. the same time, was led
by Miss Helen Starr,

Attire close of these services a
number ot the students met Dr.
Mackenzie in a short conicrcnce
which valuable suggestions
were made as to different kinds of
christian work.

It was a busy day for all con-
cerned. but especially so for Dr.
Mackenzie who spoke at the Con
gregational church Sunday evens

Chresto Preliminary Debate.

Last Saturday in Chrestc Hall
occurred the preliminary debate
for the selection of speakers to
represent the Clrresto’s agaihst
the Smith-Everett Society of
Simpson College, Indianola.

The present system of Chresto
preliminaries is an open ﬁeld and
no favors which resulted in bri’iigr
ing out nine competitors. The
whole debate showed thorough
preparation and interest, and is
one of which Chrestomathia can
be justly proud. The question
was that ofintroducing the Initia-
tive and Referendum into the
United States. The choice of
sides was optional and resulted in
themajoritysupportingtheafﬁrms
ative. Each person was limited
to eight minutes, which was per
haps a blessing in disguise to the
audience, but somewhat of a stums
bling block to the debater.

The plan of having numerous
judges was followed and gave
good satisfaction. This plan
leaves little opportunity for any
contestantto feel that anything
outside of his own capabilities
can enter into the determination
of his rank. It is the wish of the
society to express publicly the

thanks of the organization tor the
efﬁcient services of the judges.
As the result of the contest, the
ﬁrst place was awarded to Mr.
Bair, '02, the second to Mr. Bar-
nard, '04, and third to Mr. H. R.
Core. '01. The members of the
society place full conﬁdence in
the capabilities of the team and
are willing to do all in their power
to insure a glorious victory in the
ﬁnal debate.

Negotiations with the Smithi
Everett Society have been carried
on for some time' and will prob-
ably be concluded in the near
future. The debate will be held
at Indianola during the early part
of April, probably the [5th.

English Credit: for Society Work.

As a part otthe rvork in Required
English. Prof. Noble has required
the students during the year to
give before the class two addresses
of about 500 words in length, or
one address about twice as long.

This year, however, as a substi-
tute for the addresses, he has des
cided to accept evidence that an
equal amount of society work iras
been given. This is a step in the
right direction, as it will tend to
Stimulate society work among the
under classmenwheresociety work
should commence. As a rule too
littleinterest has been taken in the
societies and an action of this kind
is very agreeable and will also
be proﬁtable.

Handicap Jumps.

After the basket ball game in
the Men’s Gymnasium last Satur-
day attei'tioon,ztninterested crowd
