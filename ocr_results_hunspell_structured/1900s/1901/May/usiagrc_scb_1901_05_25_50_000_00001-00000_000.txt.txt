GRlNNELL WINS MEET!
Drake Takes Second and Ames
Third.

Once again is the memory of
several disappointments and de-
feats effaced by the realization of
a hard-fought and honorrbearing
victoryr Onceagainwasthestaid
propriety ot Grinnell disturbed
by the clanging or clamoring bells
and the banging or battered tin-
pans as the celebrating students
and townspeople gathered on the
campus around the great bonﬁre
which wasaﬁtting close to the
happy day, The end ot the
day was as bright as the be
ginning was dark. During the
iorenoon the prospect of pulling
off the meet was poor, to say the
least. This, however. did not
hinder several hundred supporters
of the track team from going to
Des Moines and taking the
chances of a postponement. The
threatening mist spent itselt
about noon, and in spite of the
heavy track, the games commit-
tee decided to hold the meet.

A crowd of fully ﬁve thousand
people witnessed the events and
no school was lacking in rooters.
Ames, Drake and Grinnell were
the most vociferous in their aSc
scrtions of their respective abili~
ties tor each had a hope of victory.
The soft. heavy track brought
many disappointments and sur-
prises and made the prospect ot
broken records very remote.
There was a slight breeze blowing
up the trackin the taces of the
runners and bike men, conspiring
with the mud to make their speed
slow. The weather conditions
made the hopes of victory among
the Scarlet and Black rootersgsink
to an extremely lolv ebb. Their
tears were never realized, tor trom
the very ﬁrst Grinnell took the
lead and held it; the points she
had accumulated being at no time
equalled by those of any other
school.

The [00 yartl dash was a re-
sumption of the struggle between
Conger and Peck, begun at the
Triangular. witll the addition of
the uncertainty involved in the
presence of Wolfe of the State
Normal. Conger bested his ope
ponents winning out in 10 35,
very fast time tor the heavy track.
The danger oi Wolte's presence

 

was minimized as third was the
best he could get. The 220 dztsh
was a neck and neck struggle,
Conger and Peck running side by
side, The judges gave Peck the
decision in what came near being
a tie race.

Welkcr did just what was ex
pected of him in the half and
mile bicycle races, About half a
dozen men were put out or the
mile bya spill at the ﬁrst turn,
Watters. upon whom Grinnell de-
pended for a place being among
the uniortunates,

Grinnell underwent a delirious
spasm when Don Evans, by one
or the prettiest sprints ot the day,
passed the star distance men and
landed ﬁrst in the half~mile run,
ﬁve points entirely unlooked for
by Grinnell. Not to be out-done
by his brother, Evan Evans made
a few resolutions and carried them
out by ﬁnishing second in the
quarter.

The heavy track worked its
greatest mischief for Grinnell in
the two hurdles, Crouch. with an
ankle which in all probability he
would not have noticed on a good
track. was compelled to take sec-
ond place in both events, Lamb
otAmestaking ﬁrst. The game
struggle he put up, running even
with, and in the low hurdles for a
time ahead ot Lamb. proved that
his claims on a good track are as
good as any one's. ‘

King gave Pell and Chapman
all they wanted to do in the pole
vault, forcing Fell up to 10 feet
8 inches, two inches over the state
record. ,

The broad jump was highly sat-
isfactory to the scarlet and black,
with Bair ﬁrst in that event. Here
was another ﬁve points which had
not been deﬁnitely counted upon.

The ptettiest race of the day,
the relay, which, although claimed
by three schools, was won easily
by Grinnell. Bair made a lead
over his competitors in the ﬁrst
lap which was increased by Con.
gcr, Lyman and Crouch. the latter
leading by over to ards at the
ﬁnish. The result of this race
made Grinnell's hold on ﬁrst place

uridenrabc and it was now only a
matter of how close Drake, her
nearest rival, would come to her.
Most of the crowd, frozen out, now
went home. the discus, hop. step
and jump, being unﬁnished.

 

lOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, MAY 25. lSOL
