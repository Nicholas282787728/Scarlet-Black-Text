en The Unit. both in a literary and
ﬁnancial way. the management
should have the cordial support of
faculty and students alike. There
is no reason why a college with as
strong an English department as
Grinnell has should not maintain
a magazine ot excellent quality.
g1N last Saturday's SCARLET
AND BLACK mention was
made of thc I. S C. Stun/mt, the
new semi weekly at Ames, as ilr
lustrating the progress that is be
ing made in college journalism,
A still more recent and striking
illustration is found in 77;! Daily
Ian/mi, the new daily paper of the
State University. This new venr
ture is the result of a combination
ot the venerable Viltcllthe/Wtﬂ
and S. U. 1. Quill. Both these
‘papeis have been published for
many years, and have served well
the interests of the University, but
the evercrectlrrlng and increasing
demands oi the students for the
news while it is yet news, caused
their discontinuance andthe estabr
lishment of a daily. This pros
grcssive move will undoubtedly
meet with a hearty response from
the students. It the First few is
sues are any critt‘rlon, The Daily
[nu/(m will rank well up among
the best university papers in the
entire country. SCARLET AND
BLACK julns with its many other
triends in wishing it success and

prosperity.

from there they were drawn to the
picnic grounds in carryalls. A
large cleared space in the midst or
the woods was used as the most
suitable place for a ﬁre. Hot cof~

nic delicacies were served to Sat
isty the appetites which the cool
night air had given to all.

Nature itself served as an ideal
background for an evening picnic
and so complete were the arranger
