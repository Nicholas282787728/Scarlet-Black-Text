ADDRESS ON SOCIAL SETTLE-
MENT.

Mr c. E. Lynde, '95, or the Roadeside
House of Des lvioincs, will Speak
to the Students Sunday

Afternoon.

It has been felt for some time
that the study of social conditions
would be more beneﬁcial to col»
lege students it closer relations
with Social Settlements could be
established.

With this in View the University
of Michigan has for two years
maintained a fellowship at the
Commons, in Chicago,7last year
Harvard, Dartmouth and Amherst
each established one at the South
End House in Boston, and now
the University of Wisconsin has
one at the Northwestern Univer-
sity Settlement. Students are
thus enabled to carry on an ilk
vestigation at ﬁrst hand while livA
ing in the settlement and to re.
ceive college credit for their work.
The value of such an arrangement
to the student is almost selt-evi-
dent.

There is a plan now under cone
sideration by which it may be
made possible for students of
Iowa college to derive the same
beneﬁts through residence at the
Road Side House. in Des Moines.
This settlement is spoken of by
Graham Taylor as oncof the most
interesting in tile country in its
location and problems. Its head
workers are Mr. and Mrs, C. E.
Lynde, both graduates of Iowa
College, and Mr. and Mrs. N. H.
Weeks, who have just come from
The Commons.

Mr. Lynde will address the slur
dents in the Chapel at folir o‘clock
Sunday afternoon, on the subject,
‘Social Settlement Work.” At
the close he will give some details
of the plan for student residence.

Mr. Lynde was a leader in the
Y, M. C. A, work while in Iowa
Collegeihas studied for
years at Chicago Theological
Seminary. residing at the Com-
mons and taking part in the work
there during that period. 'I—ie has
also been for yearsa prominent
worker and for some time Secre-
tary of the Y. M. C. A. in Des
Moines.

Both the speaker and subject
are worthy of a wide hearing.

IOWA COLLEGE GRINNELL

lOWA SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 28, 190].

 

NEW UNIT PRIZES ANNOUNCED,

The Unit Management-"Con-
tcst Open to All

literaiy magazine in Iowa Col-
lege the chici problem has been
to arouse an activc interest on the
part of students not directly Con-
nected with the board of editors,

In years past the complaint has
been made that the same contrib-
uiors have appeared in 7hr Unit
month atter month and that these
contributors were most often from
the board itsell. The fact quite
escaped many students that this
was not the normal condition nor
the one sought and that the rcme»
dy lay in their own hands.

l/ze Unit is a college institution,
the representative of the literary
spirit of the college, and ll‘lS 5‘ ir-
it cannot be adequately reﬂected
by ten persons alone.

It is as desirable that the liter-
ary lite at Grinnell should be ex
pressed with enthusiasm as that
the religious and athletic life
should be, and it must be done in
the same way, by doing the best
that we can do now, in the hope
that we may ﬁnd our strength in-
creasing with each effort.

If every student who has ever
felt the promptings of an impulse
to write will do his best this year
With the thought that he is need
ecl, TIM Um? must inevitably be a
magazine ot which we may all be
proud.

Last year a series of prizes were
offered to stimulate interest and
the results were very satisiactory
in bringing out new material both
lrom old and and new students.
Some of the best work was done
by lower classmen who have since
given strong help to The (mirror

the enjoyable work of having a
good time. The class of rooz has
an enviable reputation for this
kind of work, as is proven by many
similar gatherings previous
years, but in none of them was the
spirit of cordiality and fellowship
more evident.

All of the guests had been re-
quested to bring their earliest
photographs, and the array of
baby pictures displayed was most
bewildering, Inthecontestwhich
followed, Miss Melilili won the
ﬁrst prize. Immediately after this
white clay pipes and sheets of
tissue paper were passed around
and all were asked to transform
the pipes into dolls. The results
were decidedly varied, ranging

type by Miss Melilin. to whom the
ﬁrst prize was again given.
