Victory for Lewis Lit.

The annual debate of the LC\\‘IS
Literary society, held last evening
at Oskaloosn with the Athens th-
erary soClety at Penn College
academy, resulted in a Victory fm
Grinnell. The speakers were
greeted by a good sized audience
comfortably ﬁllingthe chapel and
showing an enthusiasm and loyal.
ty to the debaters in which the re-
spective sides of the house were
interested,which did both socictlcs
great credit,

The presidingomoer- was county
Attorney Davett. The judges
were Pro(.Dickinson,Stlp't at Mon
tezuma schools, l’l'of. L, C. Garlir
son ot Pclla and Judge Clements
othwton. Theqrrcstiondehatod
was, “Resolved, that all industrial
dispulcs in the United States
should be settled by a national
board of arbitration and that al-
bitration should be compulsory."
Grinnell afﬁrmed. The argu-
ment ot the Lewis Literary team
was consistent and direct. The
work of the other team was
thorough and for the most part
consistent but it was evident they
had not. studied the question so
deeply as the Grinnell boys.

Grinnell had the more difﬁcult
side of the question but the
negative made the mistake of
adopting a negative policy
throughout the dehate. The
speakers, in the order ot their ap~
pearancc wcre as follows: Del-
bert Dunn, A. K. Branson. F. M.
Hansen, Ross Hadley, W. 1; Paul
and John Ryan. .

Mr. Branson was the most
direct and effective speaker for
Penn although having but a slight
lead. He presented Penn's ro
buttal. Hansen's rebuttal [or
Grinnell was the feature of the
evening. Paul and Dunn both
spoke inavery direct and torso-
ful manner. The Grinnell men

were on the whole less easy on
the Floor although more direct
and effective in argument than
tilt: Penn spcalters.

The old argument, that our (lc~
hating, tn be of cqual quahly with
that of other schools must be di-
l‘ectcd by a competent instructor
in public speaking, received its
usual emphasis last evening.

Last year the Lewis Literary
‘worr avictory from the Grinllell
High School team. The Athens
Literary Society is the hardest
proposition the Lewis Society
has undcrtaken and their victory
\vcll merited. The thirty
who accompanied the speakers
to their victory returned feeling
lully repaid tor their chtort.

Congratulations arc duc the
Lewis Literary Debating Team.

The party was chaperoucd by
Miss Haincs of the Academy.

Debating Union.

Tire debating Union held its reg-
ularhusinessmecting laerednes-
day evening, in Institute Hull.
Tire attendance was by tar the
largest in the history of the union.
and the interest manifested at the
meeting reﬂected very plainly the
general scntiment of the students
that more encouragement should
be givcll our debaters. Atter the
lepol'ts ot oﬁicers and committees,
the question ot collegc credit for
debating walls was taken up, and
after a thorough discussion a com-
mittee was appointed to secure
the necessary data in regard to

work done in preparation fortie-
bates and then to confer with thC
faculty committee on the subject.
The tollowing omeers were chosen
for the ensuing year: President,
G, 0. Arnold; Vicerpro 'dcnt, W.
L. Brown; Secretaly. L, A. Quaile;
Treasurer H. L. Janie.

It is estimated that goo students
