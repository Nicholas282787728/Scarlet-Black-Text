GRINNELL AGAIN THE VICTOR.
Hard—rougt-rt Barrie at Mr. Vernonicor-
nell Defeated by a Score ot
tr to 5,

_Grinnell with a rearranged and
somewhat crippled team defeated
Cornell in a closely contested
game at Mt. Vernon last Saturday
by a score of 11 to 5. Cornell
showed by her plucky playing
throughout the game, and her es
pecially ﬁne work in the ﬁrst halt,
that she is playing lootball this
season in a way that far surpasses
that of any previous year. Bears
ing in mind the way in which Corr
nell succeeded in holding the age
gressive Beloit team down to the
close score of eleven to nothing
the week previous, Grinncll en-
tered the game expecting a hard
game and a low score. and was in
no way disappointed.

The game was played on a
slightly sloping ﬁeld the lowerend
of which Grinnoll claimed as her
goal for the ﬁrst kickroﬂ'. The
slanting ﬁeld. coupled with the
fact that within thirty yards of
Cornell’s goal the ﬁeld became
exceedingly muddy and slippery,
handicapped Grinnell consider-
ably in the ﬁrst half, as the men
were unable to hold their feet.
Evansand Lyman, who invariably
made the necessary gains up to
within this radius, could do noth-
ing on‘short end runs.

The ﬁrst half was in Cornell’s
iavor, and it was in this half, that
Cornell by short line bucks and a
twenty and ﬁfteen yard run made
her ﬁrst and only score, The
ﬁtteen yard run by which Day,
with the assistance of nearly all of
Cornell’s team,was dragged across
the line with Fisk and Lewis clings
ing to him. was one of the ﬁnest
plays of the day. Grinnell was
unable to approach nearer than
Cornell's ﬁitcenryaid line in this
half.

‘ The second half was decidedly
the reverse of the ﬁrst. Grinnell,
toliowing out Coach Trart's in.
structions, nrade two toucIr-douns
and redeemed lrcr rather poor
playing in the ﬁrst half, But for
a torty-yard end run by Kerr at
the very beginning ot the second
half, Cornell could not have once
claimed credit for making her
gains. Grinnell, on her part, took

 

a (leaded brace and by fast, hard
and aggressive playing carried the
ball three times nearly the
length of the ﬁeld, twice to a
touclr-down,mid the last time lands
ing it on Cornell‘stenryzii‘d lrne
when time was called. Fisk made
two splendid runs, one of thirty
and the other of thirtyrﬁve yards,
during this halt. and Lyman-and
Evans each may be accredited
with twenty-ﬁve yard runs.

Giinnell tumbled too frequently .

and at times when it ivas costly,
losing the ball once on Cornell's
ﬁfteen and once on her twelve
yard line by this means

Contrary to all reports which
had been received from various
sources, the Grinnell
well received and courteously
treated by Cornell’s management
and rooters, it being especially
noticeable that the latter held a
position baclt of the side
good ﬁve yards.
