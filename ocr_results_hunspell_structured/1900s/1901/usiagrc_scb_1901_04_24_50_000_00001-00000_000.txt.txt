never trained before to see what
they can tin with a little syste-

Need of a Raised Floor for the
Science Lecture Room.

Van Ev era,

The question ot having a raised
ﬂoor in the lecture room of Blair
hall has been agitated to some ex
tent arid now awaits the action of
the trustees. The classes in the
science departments are unusually
large and Since the work is largely
demonstrative it would be ofa de~
cided advantage to both protcssor
and student that all be ablc’to see
the experiments- going on in the
trout part ot the room. At pres
eat it is impossible to do this.
Most ot the colleges and universi-
ties have raised ﬂoors in the lec-
ture rooms and it is hoped that the
trustees will take the matter in
hand at once. so that we may en-
joy the useotone by the beginning
of next year.

The text rrsed by the Mission
Study class {or the spring term is
Kellogg's “A Handbook at Come
putative Religion." Titisto‘ a book
that is full of instruction and to
many it will be an intenselyintcr-
estrng study. A very lrelptul Syr
nopsrs of the text will be found‘in
the April number or the [II/[f’lﬁl-
lt‘gin/l,

Those who are desirous of at-
tending the Western Secretarial
Instilute at Lake Geneva, Wiscon-
sili, June Ztsttu 30th should begin
to tormulate their plans. Iorra
College should have ﬁve or six rep-
reseittativcs at least. Not enough
importance has been attached to
this gathering heretofore by Grin-
nellstudents. Manyoitltesti‘ong-
est mcn in the Association work
will be present.
