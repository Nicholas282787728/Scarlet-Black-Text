Inter-Society Preliminary
Debate.

The debate of last Saturday
evening was one of the best tlrat
has been held in Grinnell for sev-
eral years. The attendance was
good and the interest and appreci-
ation of the audience was plainly
manifest throughout the whole
evening. All the speakers showed
the beniﬁcial effects of the pre
liminary contests by the ease and
conﬁdence which they displayed
while on the ﬂoor, The issue was
very clearly drawn and the argu-
ments on both sides were well
sustained, charts being used by
‘both teams with considerable ei—
tect. The fact that each speaker
was given arebuttal in addition
to his direct presentation brought
forth many of the best qualrties
of the debaters, and the ready
repartee combined with the sharp
attack and defense was one of the
features otthe evening. Another
innovation was in the system of
judges. Three judgesiProfessor
Macy, Professor Wyckoff and Mr.
Rayburn. decided the merits ot
the question. seven judges-
Prot.Main, Prof Almy, Mr.Lyman,
Prof. Wyckoff, Prof. Davis, Mr.
Laros and Prof. Oldsiconsidcred
the ehcctiveness ot the speakers
as debaters and marked them on
the basis of 100 per cent. From
this the ﬁnal rank was taken. The
results in both cases were eminentr
1y gratitying and without doubt
these systems will both be made a
permanent feature of our debating
regulations.

The music of the evening, given

 

by Mrs. Heidel, Mr. Macartuey
and Mr. Cline, was especially well
received,’

Professor Norris presided. The
questiondiscussedwn ‘Rnolwrl,
That all executive drrtres in our
American cities should be conceit-
trated in the hands of the mayor,
and that his appointments should
not require conﬁrmation." The
Grinnell Institute upheld the at-
ﬁrmative and the Chrcstomathian
Society the negative.

J. w, Dignan opened the debate
for the aﬂirmative by showing that
there were three systems of mu-
nicipal government, viz: Coun»
cil System. Mixed system and the
Mayor Systemr He outlined the
policy of the afﬁrmative in sup-
porting the Mayor system and
contended that the negative must
support one at the other two

3. H. Crosby, the ﬁrst speaker
on the negative, after showing that
the remedies for the faults of the
old system lay in concentrated
power and development of coun»
cils; described the Council System
as a business system, as securing-
publicity, continuity and the ad
vantages of civil service, and the
one whichthe negative would sup-
port.

].G. Swan, who followed for the
afﬁrmative, held that the Mayor
System, which is on the federal
plan, secured the separation ot
legislative and executive duties
and ﬁxed the responsibility deﬁn-
itely in the mayor. This, he cone
tended,was the only system which
would apply to the actual condir
tions in the United States.

H. S. Dickinson followed for
the negative and argued that the
failure of the present system was
indicated by the decreased vote
for mayor and by the election of
bad mayors, The reasons tor
these tailures were ring-rule, abuse
of power and misappropriation.
The Council System would reduce
these cvilsr

G. O. Arnold,the last on the al-
ﬁrmativc, by means of charts.
showed that in eight cities the tax
rate had been reduced on an aver
age of i§.i per cent. while under
the Mayor System. Thus without
dimunition along other lines the
Mayor System has, in practical
working, been economical to tax-

payers,

 

 

E. F. Denison, the last speaker
on the negative, gave a graphic
description of the Council System
as it exists in England today and
then showed that the conditions
are not essentially diﬂclent from
those at the United States and
that the system could be beuer
ﬁcially introduccd into this couur
try,

In addition to this 10 minutes
for direct presentation. the two
ﬁrst speakers on each side were
given 5 minutes for rebuttal and
Mr. Crosby and Mr. Swan were
given 7 minutes each for closing
rebuttal.

The debate was so evenly divide
cd and so warmly contested that
the result was in doubt until the
decision of the judges, which \vas
two to one in favor of the afﬁrmar
tiyc. The ﬁnal ranking of the
judges on speakers gave Crosby
ﬁrst, Swan second, Denison third
and Arnold fourth.

Grinnell may uell be satisﬁed
with the general showing of the
debate and feel assured that the
college will be well represented in
the debate with Washburn.
