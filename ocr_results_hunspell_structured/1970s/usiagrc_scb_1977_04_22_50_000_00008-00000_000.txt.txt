E
, The good hfe: the ten best rooms on campus

by Toni Paltzer
and Debbie Weiner

After many hours of laborious
researcht two intrepid 5&8
reporters have, witha great deal oi
objectivity, determined the ten
best rooms on campus. Three
nights of tramping through the best
and worst housing Grinnell has to
offer has resulted in two pairs of
sore feet and a list of the Most Awe-
lnspiring Abode: Around.

The best of the lot, Mary
Brandt‘s single on Mears second,
room 100, is as close to perfection
as any room on campus. in case of
a hailstorm, this room would be at
a distinct disadvantage with its
gigantic old iashioned windows.
But this is compensated for by the
excellent views: looking out the
south Window one can see much of

the southern part or Grinneil, and
the west window provides a
glimpse of Burling and central
campus. The north window can
'serve as an entranceway to a small
balcony, on which one can wile

away long spring evenings in,

comfort and privacy.

“Any kind of African Violet will
grow in this room," according to
Brandt, due to the vast quantities
of sunlight that course through the
Windows. A unique feature of the
Windows is the Wood latticework
that adorns them.

Also, the room is huge. A room
this large normally has bad
lighting, but a dimmer switch
easily solves that. The large closet
contains a medicine chest,
although the room has no sink

single on the third floor. Because a
two~room single is an exceedingly
rare commodity, this room, Cowles
751, deserves attention.

The entire suite is long and
relatively narrow, running north to
south with single north and south
windows, and two windows facing
east. Hurricane force winds can be
generated through the rooms if the
connecting door and the north and
south windows are open. In warm
weather, this breeze will keep the
rooms cool, and in the winter, {our
radiators keep the cold out.
However. be water temperature
in the dorm leaves much to be
desired: according to
Lynn Steinhaus, the room’s oc-
cupant, there is no hot water.

A {our-room triple on Hailles
second, room 432, also has a

temperature problem—one ol’ the
three bedrooms is frigid during the
winter. But since this is the best
triple on campus, this defect can be
ignored. The arrangement is
perfect: a large outer room serves
as a lounge, and each of the three
bedrooms is equipped with its own
medicine cabinet, sink. and closet.
This allows each occupant much
privacy, along widi the com-
panionship provided by room~
mates. This triple is distinguished
irom the other four-room triples in
Haines by its View of the entire
central campus area, and the extra
electrical outlet in the center room.
All three bedrooms are pretty
small, but after all, this is a triple,
and the center room provides
compensation.

‘In the evenings romantic sunsets
fill the room through the

four western windows.’

Heating is more than adequate
Wim two radiators. On a more
aesthetic level, both the drapes and
color of the walls are better than
the normal Grinnell standards, In
other words, they are not beige,
The major (and perhaps only)
drawback is the traffic on the fire
escape, which allows passers-by a
full View of the room,

However, if you did not draw
number one, you need not be
depressed There are at least nine
other decent rooms. It was im-
possible to rank these rooms
because each had its own unique
features.

Haines second is the only ﬂoor
blessed with two rooms among the
top ten. Ken Brown’s single, room
433, can accomodate a number of
furniture arrangements. The
radiator is tucked under the
Windows, and the Sink IS discretely
placed in a far corner of the room.
The room is large. and the two
windows allow for adequate
lighting and a pleasant View of
central campus.

Onerroom North Campus doubles
don't normally find their way onto
ten best lists, but in this case an
exception must be made. The next
room has more of everything: five
windows, three closets, three
overhead lights, and three
radiators. Although huge, the room
does not appear to be cavernous

room 409. It is the only room on
campus with a true hallway, which
connects two decent sized rooms. It
has its own bathroom, with a sink,
bathtub, and toilet. This former RA
suite also contains a kitchenette
with a sink and built-in wooden
cabinets. Once the faucet in this
sink is turned on, water ﬂows
continuously, so you can wash both
hands at the same time. The
luxurious accoutrements of the
room include plush \vall-torwall
carpeting, iloor-to-ceiling cur-
tains which deaden the noise from
the loggia, two overhead lights, a

this, the room has carpeting, two
hallway doors, a complete bath. a
single closet. and too much heat in
the winter.

According to Tom Arenberg,
an expert on Langan Pit, tropical
temperatures can also 'be ‘a
problem in the best pit chamber on
campus, Paul DeLaney’s room,
200. The room has a rotten view, of
course, but aside from the normal
pit window, it has a small side
window with cute little curtains,
The room merits inclusion on a ten
best list because of its large size,
red tile floor, brick wall, two
closets (one of which also boasts a
brick wall), and nicely patterned
curtains

but other rooms have specia
features which deserve attention.
A Main fourth double, room 70,
offers a beautiful sunset. Ana
Fong’s single on Langan third,
room 231, has a nice sloping roof,
lots of storage space, and a good
view, Six Norris doubles are being
used as singles, making them
among the largest on campus.

There are many excellent
doubles which did not make the
list. The Rawson first tworroum
double, number 314, includes

because of the noise level and lack
oi sunlight.

The loggia location also plagues
the tonroom double on Read first,
room 500. But this room has one
great benefit: the occupants do not
have to steal from the lounge,
because the room comes complete
with seven pieces of beautiful

usual institutional desk. dresser
and chair, these pieces are of

the Norris first twtrroom double.
It is the only room on campus with
its own shower, and it also has two

Hopefully, this list of desireable

rooms on campus will be useful i?

man with a number in the 300’s,
however, these rooms are
definitely out of reach. Do not be
discouraged, because there are
plenty oi lousy rooms around

have better luck next year. and if
you do, you should give these ten

top rooms a good look.
