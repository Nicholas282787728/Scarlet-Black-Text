Terminal City

by Ted Price

Darby gym is known as T.C.
(terminal city) to a growing
number of people at Grinnell.
“Terminal city," which used to be
the men's varsity locker room, is
now the Site of the college’s
computer. PDP-ll-45. Un-
fortunately, PDPJIAS does not
have a nickname.

As you enter the computer center
through the locker room door, you
are immediately confronted by a
sterile white interior which looks
like the inside of a doctor’s office.
In the outer room you see several
teletype machines which are
hooked up to the computer which is
located in the inner room.

The teletype hookups perform a
myriad of functions. There are 17
different computer programs that
instruct the novice how to operate
the machine. In addition to the

, tutorial programs, the student can

choose from approximately one
hundred different game programs
They range from football to hor-
seracing to Hi Q to Monopoly.
when the teletype console is
activiated, the computer prints out
the following: “Please say hello."
If you comply with its request, it
will proceed to give the date and
the time of day. The next step is to
give the computer your password
(which a member of the
professional staff has already
assigned you), and if it is the
correct one, FDP<11»45 will
respond by welcoming you to
. Grinnell College, and you may
begin to run your program.
StudenB have unlimited time and
can stay at the teletype hookup as
long as they want, provided nobody
else wants to use the terminal.

To the residents of Younkers,
Tabitha Hoskinson is hard to
believe No child of but three years
has that much energy, or that
much to say. She is friends with
almost everyone, usually from the
moment she sees them. Bubbly,
energetic and nearly constantly on
the move, Tabitha is the daughter
of Younkers’ RA‘s, Robcrt and
Marilyn Iloskinson Within the
family, she holds the position of
‘proprietor of the apartment:

In the morning, residenm of
Younkers are greeted by the
shuffling of Tabby's orange
“iootlcs” bright and early. She
welcomes the maid‘s morning
company with a helpful spirit and
her plastic sweeper. And every
couple of days she meets the
vending machine man to help him
load the candy and cigarette
machines. other friends include
most students on the first floor,
wllo consider Tabitha a “very
bright and articulate” young girl.

Tabitha loves to play
“imagination games”rmoking
soup, creating block cities and
imaginary people. The authors had
a birthday party with her for
”Dolly” with “monkey,” “koala
bear,” “cat." and “hippo" as
guests,

Since the lioskinsons became

her parents, and thc floor, with

keeping a sharp eye on the Comings\ 4

Tabby likes ”kittyscal,” she is not

Tabitha likes her mother‘s

is refreshing to come home to her

bright spot in most people's day.

The teletype machines print out
your program on long sheeB of
paper, but they will soon be
replaced by cathode ray tubes
(CRTl. A CRT looks like a small
TV set equipped with a keyboard.
A CRT Will give the operator the
option of having his-her program
printed out on paper, or not.

From the outside room you can
look into the inner room where the
computer itself is stored. This
room has to be maintained at a
constant temperature and
humidity level. Because of the
sensitive equipment, students are
not usually allowed in the inner
room unless accompanied by a
staff person.

in addition to the,main com-
puter, there is a smaller one, PDP-
ll-lo, equipped with a graphic
terminal and plotter, The main
feature of the PDP-ll-ll), as far as l
was concerned, was the Lunar
Landing game. The object of the
game is to land the spaceship on
the moon‘s surface just at the right
spot, so that the spaceman can get
out and visit the McDonald‘s
located on the moon. If you land ﬁle
craft safely, he gets out and orders,
“Two cheeseburgers and a Big
Mac to go." it is much more dif-
ficult to make a successful landing
than it sounds, In fact, it is quite
easy to demolish your space
capsule, at which point the come
puter derisively remarks, “Well
you certainly blew that one,”

After you have destroyed your
lunar module several times, you
start running into old spaceship
wreckage and you begin to realize
that it is time to give up, However,
some of us are not very bright and

we keep at it until we make the
ultimate blunder and land on
McDonald's itself, which
devastates that venerable ins
stitution and your spaceship too.
By that time, the computer has
given up on you, and you have to
reprogram it.

Another feature of the inner
room is a terminal that prints out a
number of drawings ranging from
Snoopy to a wide variety of nude
women. Once again, a stall person
has to assist you with the operation
of this machine.

The professional staff of six at
the computer center is very willing
to help introduce students to the
new $225,000 system. They are
there from 8 am. to 5 pm, and
paid student aides are there to
offer assistance from 8 am. to 12
midnight which is closing time.

in addition to providing a helping
hand. student aides maintain order
and as one professional staff
member put it, “They keep
students from writing on the
walls,” So far there have been no
graffiti placed on the walls which,
is a rather remarkable
achievement considering the
nature of the antiseptic white
rooms of ”terminal city” which
need some sort of adornment.

The student aides close up shop
at midnight, but there are ten.

until 2 am. This would be
economically feasible because the
computer runs 24 hours a day, even
though it is only in use is hours a
day. (The rationale behind this is
the analysis that in the long run
money is saved.) Thus, the only
economic consequence would a,
slight increase in student wages.

l have listed some of the
frivolous uses of the computer, but
it is also utilized for academic and
administrative purposes. Ter~
minals will be set up in the Science
nail, the Library, Goodnow,
Carnegie, ARH, the Registrar’s
Office, the Alumni Development
office, and the Business Office.
There will also be a portable ter»
minal.

The computer contains
academic and » personal in»
formation on Students, and
theoretically only professional
staff have access to this in-
formation, although there are
student aides who have been
known to say otherwise. Faculty
and administrative payrolls, and
financial aid information are all
fed into the computer. Likewise,
the Development Office utilizes
PDP-le to keep records on
alumni and friends of the college.

While the computer is an
invaluable asset to the college,
there is apprehension among some
administrators about overuse of
the computer to the point that
Grinnell might become a deper-
sonalized and distant institution.
