rinnell baseball team gained its
second Victory in four gamcs as
Craig Zippo pitched a 2—hitter, be.

a blistering hitting attack in the
second game of the doubleheader,
pounding the Pioneers 11.1 andthus
eliminating Grinnell from the con.
ference race.

In the first game Zippe gave a
masterful performance. No more
than 5 Cornell batters hit in any
inning. He had a perfect game going
through 2 2/3 innings and lost his
shim-1t With two outs in the last'
inning. A brisk southerly wind
helped both pitchers as balls hit
in the air were driven back towards
the inﬁeld. However, the way Zippe
was pitching the wind could have
been blowing out at hurricane force
and Cornell still would not have hit
the ball anywhere. '

The Pioneers jumped out into the
lead in the second inning when they
Scored all of their runs. it was
one of the few times Grinnell wa~
first out of the gate and it paid
off. Mark Hanisch, performing in
front of his parents, made their
hearts glad when he singledwith one
Out in the second. Bill Johnson foll-
owed with a grounder to the Short-
stop which he proceededoothrow aw.

the bases for Wes Fuj . Wjii lash»
ed a hot smash which was booted
by the second baseman and Went
on into right field scoring Hanisch
and Johnson and chasing Lee over
to third. Lee promptly scored when
a shaken Cornellpitcherthrew wild-
1y by his catcher.

in addition to Zippe, the whole in-
field was sharp. Johnson at first,
Hanisch at second, John Haigh at
shortstop, and Brennan at third all
made ﬁne plays to keep Cornellblilt-
ters off the basepaths. Lee‘s catch-
ing was the perfect Compliment to
Zippe’s pitching, ﬂawless.

The Pioneers had only two hits in
the game, quisch’s and one by
Zippe. Zippe struck out six and

was enjoyed by a large crowd of
partisans (Which could have been
largerl).

In the second game Cornell jumped
on pitcher Paul Delaney for six runs
in the first inning. Delaneyhas been
shaky in the first inning several
times this season and Cornell took
advantage of his control problems
by batting around. However. he set—

Netmen
Cornell,

by John LoIn

This past Saturday the Grinnell
Tennis team found new life on its
WAY to ahliterating two Midwestern
Conference opponents. The Pioneers
were anything but hosts as they sent
Cornell and Coe Collegesbackhome
with respective 9-0 and 23—1 pasler—
ings.

The Pioneers totally dominated
Cornell in route to their second
shutout of the year. The only diffi-
cult match (or Grinnell was at the
num‘JBr one singles slot, but Brad
Varales eventually prevailed by
“punching out" his opponent 5—7,
7-6, and 6—3. The rest of the mat-
ches were almost pushovers as none
of them ‘35th any longer then two
sets. The two most impressive v
tories were by number two man Neil
Trabich and number five singles pl—
ayer Daniel "Boone" Diwards.Tra-
bich demolished his Ram opponent
by a score of 6—0, 6—3 while Ed—

Wullop
Coe

wards had little mercy in his 6-0,
6-1 victory.

Later, that same afternoon, the
Pioneers very nearly duplicated th—
eir win by smashing Coe a to 1.
The only blemish {or the Pioneers
resulted when Ricky Kellar (no. 4
singles) lost aclose three setmatch.
Edwards was again in near perfect
form by allowinghis foeonlyasingle
game. Equally impressive was the
triumph by the "Dynamic D10" oi
Vazales and Trahich as they pluck-
ed their Kohawks hyaG—l, 6-3 count.

After this Saturday’s tremendous
victories the Pioneers have nowre-
gained their early season momen-
tum, but if they can maintain the-
ir winning ways against Iowa State
University, St. Dial, and defending
Conterence Champ Carleton is 3.
A estion that only the quality of
the Pioneers‘ play will be able to
answer.

Women Blitz Penn

by Dale Calvert

DSKALOOSA, IA--Like the wom-
en’s field hockey and swim team-i,
the women's tennis team tinishedthe
season strong. The net—women lost
their first meet, tied the next two.
and won the fourth. The win Came
Saturday versus William Penn Col-
lege, as the Grinnellians prevailed
6—3. .

Cathy Lee, who has been the squ<
ad's most proﬁcientpoint-gettertha
roughout, was thrown for a double
loss playing number one singlesand
doubles. Her doubles partner, Linda
Pedcn, did manage to win her sing~
les match handily.

In addition to Peden’s si gles vic—
tory at the numller two position,

the Pioneers picked up winningper—
forma ices from number three Ellen
Yacknln, num'xer four Ellen Grady,
five Karen Kuhn, and six Jen Jen-
kins. One team regular summed up
the meet as “easy."

AithOJgh the doubles duo of Grady
and Kahn dropped its match, Yack-
nin and Jenkins became double win-
ners by winning the third doubles
match.

The squad finishes at 1- -2, and
all signs point towards a strong sq-
uad next year. Of the six mnking
Saturday’s trip, only two are sen—
iors. These are Jen Jenkins andEl-
len Yacknin. Most of the women
on the squad, and about 20 expres-
sed early season interest, are Ir-
es’lmerl and sophomores.
