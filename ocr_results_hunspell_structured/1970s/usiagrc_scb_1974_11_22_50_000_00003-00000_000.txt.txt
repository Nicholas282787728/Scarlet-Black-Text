you have rendered the College, and

Walker: welcomes Turner

To the Editor:

lwish to express to the members
of the Grinnell Community my
appreciation for the reception
which I received as a candidate for
the presidency. Naturally, I was
disappointed that I was not
selected for the position but I
assure you that such initial
disappointment has passed and it
will have no bearing on my
willingness and desire to help
vigorously the new president in
making Grinnell the College that
we know it has the potential to be.

I have known President-Elect
Turner for some time and have the
highest regard for his ability to

serve’as a distinguished president
of Grinnell College. I am convinced
that he will provide the leadership
that is required to lead the College
in all areas or its operation, I in.
tend to remain on as Dean of the
College and also intend to do
everything I can to assisthim in his
efforts to lead the College. I know
him as a warm and personable
man with a firm understanding of
What a college should he and of
what a college president should do.

I also know well the members of
the Grinnell Community and am
confident that you will support him
in his new role as our president.

Wn ldo S. Walker

To the Editor:

Bruce Tucker should be com-
mended for his well conceived and
well executed letter. However, one
thing bothers me. Bruce, your
observations seem to be the
product of a sympathetic un.
derstanding of Mr, UM and so your
letter would seem to be an act of
moral courage, But I can't seem to
escape the COnViCtion that there's
something satirical in your use of
an energy diagram, maybe you

were doing the whole thing tongue
in cheek atter all, like someone
who gets his kicks by taunting
parapalegics. Oh, i can understand
why you find it humorous. A man
who can blithely arrange for a
public showing or his etchings on
the pages or the 5&8 would have to
be amused by the self-ridiculing
nature at Mr. UM’s mumbled in.
vitations to a private showing.

While I understand the disap-
pointmentthat you must feel at not
having been selected as President
yourself, It am gratified by your
recognition of President-Elect
Turner’s abilities and your
willingness to continue to serve as
Dean. I am sure that the College
will rise to new heights of eXr
cellence with two administrators of
such eminence and humanity and
lee] that the Faculty will be well
served by the two of you. Speaking
both as a colleague and a friend, I
am looking iorward to an extended
period oi harmonious and
productive endeavor lor the
College.

You may rest assured that the
Faculty will continue to cooperate
with the Administratlon in all way
that are appropriate,

Arnold Adelberg

On the Buckley
amendment and

student rights

In an 5&5 interview, Dean Waldo Walker called the Buckley
amendment of the General Education Provision Act
"foolishness. it’s a stupid piece of legislation.“

We beg to differ with the Dean ofihe College. With Coming of
the age of the computer, the seriousness of accumulated files
cannot be ignored. Records of almost every act a student
makes all an institution is likely to be on file—correspondence,
academic achievement and honors, interviews, applications
for independent or foreign study, disciplinary actions, tutorial
evaluations, letters of recommendations. The list can only
accumulate during four years at Grinnell, not to mention any
files passed on from high school counselors who were probably
thankful to rid their files of graduating seniors to make room
for incoming freshmen.

Before, when a detrimental recommendation or evaluation
entered a student‘s folder, it used to be difficult to prevent II'
from being senfoutside of the issuing institution, the only valid
place for such records. With the aid of the Buckley amend-
ment, students may now halfthe mailing process if they do not
wish the inquiring party to have them. This right also Prevents
such confidential information from being arbitrarily or ac-
cidently passed to law enforcement agencies or credit
bureaus.

Educators are primarily worried about the effect of the
amendment on letters of recommendation. In the same
breath, however, educators admit that lwo»lhirds of the
recommendations are so predictable in their praise of students
that admission counselors generally ignore them.

Asolution lothe letter of recommendation problem would be
to amend the Buckley amendment so that the letters remain
confidential but only for the use of the institution to which
they were addressed. Under these circumstances, the
remaining onerthlrd of usable recommendations would retain
their validity.

The parents’ confidential statement could also be included in
the amendment to the amendment to protect parenls’ rights
not to reveal their income to” their offspring. The Con.
fidenliallty of the statement should bea family decision.

The College has currently banned access to student files
Until the 45»day limit is Up. By that time, the Office of
Education under the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare should have released guidelines for colleges and
universities to follow. This move is wise an the part of the
College since potential violation of legal rights due to
misunderstanding of the new statute is likely.

Despite the government’s lack of published guidelines, we
feel that the Buckley amendment, for the first time, gives a
student some control over what is maintained on file and
serves to protect his futUre upon graduation, knowing that one
can leaves bad record behind and start over again.
