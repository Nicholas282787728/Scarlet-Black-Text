Eco-System: UN Concern?

by Keith Kozloi'f

Stockholm, June, 1972, Attended by
114 nations (and the Hog Farm com—
mune), the auspicious United Na~
tions Conlerence on the Human En~
vironment demonstrated that the
U.S. is still reluctant to ackno -
ledge its international responsib -
ities and that the U.N. is pitiIully
inadequate to Ilandle all but the most
paltry environmental problems. The
UN. could become an eiiective wore
ld government it it was reorganized
along ecological principles.

The most notable achievement of
the U,S.'s ecology crusade was Pro»
jeCt Jonah, a ten~year moratorium
on whaling, Which led U,S. Chief dele-
gate Russell Train to proudly pro-
claim, “I am personally an envir—
onmentalist, not apolitician,” When,
however, politics and ecology
merged into a single issue, such as
“ecocide”. the U.S. delegation crinr
ged and dismissed as irrelevant
the estimated 26 million bomb crat»
ers which are 30 feet across and
15_ ieel deep, and the massive de-
foliation and bulldozing in Indochina.
Irrelevant--desplte the assertion of
a Visiting researcher that, “the
damage caused by the largerscale
disorganization oi the envrronment
may be felt [or Centuries . "

Ecocide is a minor issue Com-
pared to the more subtle “eco-
logical imperialism" which can be
described as the degrading oi the
ecosystems oi agrarian societies by
industrial societies, Energy and ma-

terials ilow from the less organ— ~

ized to the more organized sys-
tem. Both economic and ecological
imperialism may simply be dittere
ent expressions oi the same phenr
omena,

Cash cropping is one method tor
attaining economic development and
rapid industrialization is another.
Developing countries came to the
Conference to find out how toindus-
trialize without polluting. But itwas
unlikely that the 11.3: or any other
big power. would admit the close
interrelationships ‘hetween econo-
mic growth, consumption, and env
vironmental problems. Such intere
relationships are by no means ene

demic to capitalist economies as is
evidenced by the pollution of Lake
Baikal in the Soviet Union, Envir-
onmental disruption from rapid de-
velopment in the poor nations Could
be minimized if they were granted
increased financial and techno—
logical assistance. Most nations at
the Conference agreed that the poor
nations should be given more aid.
The US. did not follow suit.

The U.N. Coniercnce indicated the
world government’s ineliectiveness
in solving ecological problems. In
the biosphere, as in all ecosystems,
the component parts have evolved

a Whole, as Well as for their own

survival. The selieseeking trend
among the component nations 0! the
biosphere should theoretically be
tempered with a world organiza-
tion which has the power to eniorce
its own policies.

The U.N. does have the potential
of becoming an effective decision—
making and eniorcing agency, accor-
ding to ecologist Howard 0dum,
through the allocation oi voting
power on the basis or power bude
get. A nation would be allotted a
quantity 01 votes proportional to the
amount or energy which annually
passes through lts system, Since
military and economic power stem
directly irom the powerbudget,vot-
ing power would always correspond
to real ability to inﬂuence the world,
Thus, a nation could display its
power by voting without the waste-
ful expense oi a direct. mi tary
or economic test. A majority'vote
would automatically be backed by a
power excess so that any attempt
to ignore the majority, as Japan
is doing on the whaling moratorium,
could be prevented through the
channeling of power reserves into
enforcement.

In addition, says 0dum, the energy

History And Sludge

Much to the detriment of our aca-
demic work, this columnist has spent
the past week, with the help ofra
dredging crew made up ot his
cronies, rescuing Garst from the
depths of tenipestuous Rock Creek
Lake. While saving the waterlogged
eagle, many other articles of inter-
est were netted.

First Oivall we iound the Long
Horn’s lost waitress. "May I take
your order?” she asked. “Yes,
we want another stein, a cup oi
sludge and trench-fried sea weed.”
“I’m sorry this is a Iresh-water
lake,” she retorted as she gurgled
back to the depths. We never saw

Opinion Probed

As part oipresideirtLeggett'sproe
pusal tor a comprehensive evalua»
tion of the College, DeanWall, along
with a committee oiStudents and ad-
ministration is attempting an
appraisal 01 student opinion on three
or the eight areasmentioned byLeg-
gett. A questionnaire regarding the
length of time required for a B A,
degree, independenlstudyattheColr
legs and the relationship oi work/
study programs tostricllyacademic
education has been distributedtothe
entire student body, The Dean’s
office has requested that the queSr
tionnaires be returned to student
advisers by October 13,

Wall commented on the intended
use or the questionnaire, stating
“Your answers will assist all of us
in determining policies and guideA
lines as well as providing us with a
sharper locus on the broader picA
ture of the role and purposes of
the liberal arts college.” Questions
deal with both student experiences
and opinions, attempting to deter
mine the realistic situation as well
as desires tor Iuture changes.

her again; could she have returned
to Grinnell? As we write this in
the Horn we rather doubt it.

Next we stumbled upon the me
tamous Alan Jones Locker which
we had assumed had flown to Eng-
land late last summer. Opening it
we tound two books on “Utopian
and Apocalyptic Movements at Grin-
nell”, A poster saying “Give an ugh
tor Al” and a third grade art book
with a teacher’s critique ”I’m a.
irard you have a toggy historical
perspective”. We let it sink back
to the bottom so it's contents would
never be known.

Next came a deed signed by J.B.
Crrnnell giving Grinnell College to
the Ioway Indians (Not to be Con-
tused with the Coe Collawks) tor
petuity on the grounds that they did
not convert Gardner lounge into a
pub. In that event a bolt oi lighte
nrng will strike one ptetier Iollow-
ed by a chorous of heavenly host
and the woman’s Christian Teme
perance Association singing “Hal-
lelujah.”

Last but not least suriaced the in-
domitable Eagle. To celebrate the
event Carst will appear, in person,
Saturday morning on Mac Field.
We ieel rt lit and just that in the
Crinnell tradition at destroying all
traditions any group who wants him,
and thinks they can carry a 273
pound casteiron eagle without run

articles on a stupid eagle, tradition

The rumor that we originated the
rumor that we are not people is
true. We needed another sentence

0dum’s concept, greatly over-
simplified here, is practical, it is
obvious from the U.N. Conference
that international environmental
