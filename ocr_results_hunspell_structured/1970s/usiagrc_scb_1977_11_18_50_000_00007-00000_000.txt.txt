Computermen finish second in regional meet Aquam€n prepare

Grinnell seeks revenge in nationals held in February

r’s Note: Organized com-
petition typifies athletics. Recently
organized competition has entered
thc computer world. Grinnell's
recent involvement in this new and
unique tom of competition ialong
with other factors) has labeled
computer programmers as
computer jocks. Alter thc com-
pletion or one suCh competition,
held last week. perhaps thc term
computer jock shall be the most
appropriate labeling for four
Grinnell programmers.

The Grinnell College Computer
Programming team startled
onlookers by capturing second
place in the fourth gathering of the
Association of Computing
Machinery North Central
Programming Contest held in St.
Louis last weekend. Their second
place showing gives the team—
comprised of Scott R. Porter,
Newton White, Bruce Albrecht,
and Steve McKelveyia chance for
revenge at nationals, which will be
held in Detroit during February.

Barely edged out by the home
team. Washington University,
Grinnell trounced University of
illinois at Champaign-Urbana,
University of Nebraska at Lincoln,
University of Missouri at Rolla
twinner of last year’s regionals
and third at the nationals), Wichita
State UniverSlty, St. Louis
University. Augustana College,
and Southwest Minnesota State
University.

The universities’ strong Com-
puter Science departments gave
them an advantage, but this was
offset by the “Grinnell
Experience." As team captain
Porter quipped, 1‘ ‘Techies‘ just
don’t have what it takes."

Intense pressure was put on the
other teams when Grinnell
members surprised everyone
(except themselves) by finishing
all of their problems first.

By Bruce Albrecht and Newton Wllite

Notable accomplishments by the
Grinnell team Came when White
solved a problem which only three
teams solved, and when Porter’s
program was singled out for its
elegance.

With the programming team's
strong start, rumor has it that the
team will receive varsity status,
thus making it eligible for a
letter in computer.

Male cagers commence drills for ’77-7 8

By Russ Win k .

Undercover agents from places
like Northfield and Mount Vernon
may soon be forced to take notice
of the two dozen conspiratorial
young men who have been meeting
each afternoon in the seclusion of
Darby gymnasium.

The plot being formulated by
these devious, pituitary exceptions
is simple: give Grinnell its best
cage season in recent memory. No
easy task. The road to a suc»
cessful year Will be littered with
hurdla. But a perusal of Pioneer
personnel uncovers cause for real
optimism.

At the pivot, a big bonus would be
the emergence of 6’71/2" senior
Gunnar Tilers as the dominant
center in the Midwest Conference,
which is precisely what Coach Art
Peterson says Gunnar can be if he
plays closer to his ability. Pushing
Thors is talented 6’6" freshman
Pat Walsh. whose strong inside
game at both center and forward
has been slowed by an ankle
sprain. 6’4" sophomore Tony
Whitaker, easily the team’s best
leaper, is improving and another
tough customer around the basket.

Husky 6' 6" junior Matt Miller, a
fine shooter, who Peterson feels is

gaining in confidence, is the top
contender at strong forward and
can also play center. Other strong
forwards are 6’ 3” freshman Pat
Dalton, who has been a pleasant
surprise, and Walsh. Candidates at
quick forward include popular 5' 63”
senior Joe Kingma and 6’ 4” junior
Roy Shepard, another classy
shooter.

The Pioneers lost two fine
swingmen in Paul Delaney and
Carl Warner. But 5' 5" sophomore
Phil GuLtman provides tough
defense and outside shooting as a
forward or big guard. Gridders
Mike McCurry and Charlie Gogel
are also capable of manning both
swing spots, as is 6' 3" freshman
Mark Dyreson.

Ballhandling is no longer a sore
spot. 5' 10” junior, Roger Warner,
returns from a year's sojourn in
Mexico to give the Pioneers real
leadership at point guard.
Challening Warner for playrnaking
responsibilities is impressive 6' 0"
freshman Curt Pabst.

Frank orth, an obstreperous e'
2" junior, started part-time last
season and Peterson likes his
shooting and feel for the game.
Another big plus could be the
return of quick 5'11" senior Rob

Eyre after a year’s absence from
basketball. Other guard hopefuls
include 6’1” sophomore stu
Butzier and sharpshooting junior
Jon Chazen.

Hopes abound for a big im-
provement over last year’s record.
“1 believe this team is going to be
very Eood~potentially much
better than .500," Coach Peterson
said. The only area in which he is
not satisfied with the squad‘s
progress thus far is team defense.
Peterson anticipates a good,
balanced scoring attack with this
group.

The veterans all call the team’s
attitude “excellent.” Peterson
agrees, saying, “i think we’ll be a
very tight team, The balance will
provide a lot of competition and
keep motivation high. Nobody can
relax by thinking they’ve got a
starting berth sewn up. It‘s a very
healthy team situation.”

Over the past twenty years the
Grinnell men’s swimming team
has won prestige and over a half
dozen conference championships
Last year’s team won high acclaim
by crowning its undefeated season
(in conference meets) with the
Midwest Conference Cham-
pinnship.

When one glances at the plaque
displaying school swimming
reCords, the name Chambers
appears under almost every listed
event. John Chambers, who (:07
captained with Doug Johnson,
graduated last spring and will for
the first time in four years not
donate his highly welcomed talents
to the Pioneer swimming team.

Despite the loss of Chambers,
Johnson and perhaps the All—
American diving talents of Norm
Zimmerman, everyone looks
optimistically toward this year‘s
swimming team. Co-captain Bruce
Jones believes this year’s team
“could be just as good if not better
(than last year‘s team).” Jones

concluded his statement by
mentioning that the team’s acA
complishments depend greatly
upon how strenuously team
members work out

Depth in talent appears to
highlight this year‘s team. Veteran
swimmer Jones, caecaptainFrank
Halley, Greg Gomez, Brian Jones,
Jeff Noble, Charlie Wibiralske,
Greg Olson, and Dave Kapp are
expected to lead the team to
honors, Helping out in the swim
ming events are Norm Zinr
merman. Bill Raynolds and Kevin
Rackstraw, Pioneer divers are
Mark Hatherly and Tom Halpen-
stell.

Monday the Pioneer swimmers
will awake to the master’s crowing
as their meet, the Pioneer Relays,
begins at 7:00 am The following
day the Pioneers host a triangular
meet against South Dakota State
and Jewell College at 12:00. Both
these meets will be held in the
PEG.

Pioneers crush U of Chicago

By Chris sodoma

Last Saturday, the Grinnell
Pioneers Closed out their 1977
campaign by routing the U of
Chicago, 36-13. This gave the
Pioneers (4-4—1) their first winning
record since the team went 5-4 in
1970. '

The Pioneers started the scoring
on a 79 yard pass from Randy
Reavis to Phil Cebuhar. The PAT
was booted by Dave Morote to give
the Pioneers a 7-0 lead. Chicago
scored a TD on a 69-yard run which
knotted the score at 7. Still in the
first quarter, Fred McDougal
scored the first of his two touch-
downs on a one yard plunge. The
PAT failed, which left'the score 13-
7 in favor of the Pioneers.

Early in the third quarter, after
the Pioneer defense had sacked the
Chicago QB for a safety,
McDougal scored his second TD of
the afternoon on an eight yard
scamper, which gave the Pioneers
an insurmountable 22-7 lead at the
end of three quarters.

In the fourth quarter, Chicago
fought back with a TD, cutting the
Grinnell lead to 22-13, However,
Reavis found Cebuhar on a 12 yard

scoring pass for, that com-
lbination’s second TD of the af-
ternoon. Morote split the uprights
to give the Pioneers a 2913 lead.
Don Petrich tallied the final
Grinnell score on a fine 89 yard
scurry. Bob Grant kicked the PAT
which made the final score 36-13.
The Pioneer running attack was
awesome against Chicago. In 61
Carries, the Pioneers gained 414
yards. McDougal lead the squad
with 151 yards. Petrich had as
yards on only three carries, Reavis
had a fine day through the air
hitting 5 of 9 passes for 137 yards.
The Pioneer defense, led by Rob '
Eyre, Grant and Petrich,
held the “Windy City" to only 4.2
yards per carry on the turf, and
only 50 yards through the airways.
The Pioneers will lose 13
members of this year's squad to
graduation, including captains
Paul Crane, Bob Grant, Mark
Bowman, and Paul Matecki. Also,
the team will miss Tony Reid,
Randy Reavis, Mike Hopkins, Dale
Lamb, Rob Eyre, Dave Seeberger,

 

Steve McNamara, Doug Cum-
mings and Phil Cebuhar.

Female cagers start soon

lvaluable asset to this year’s

team,” coach Cindy Winkler
stated.

Although the team went \vinless
lduring last year’s season, this
lyear's record should show Conn
:siderable improvement. The team
‘has a lot of depth behind the initial
live starters. Last year, the team's
main problem was playing con-
sistently through the third and
fourth quarters,

“With so much depth we should
be able to keep running hard and
.stay in contention throughout the
entire game," Winkler said.

There is height on this year's
team with several player's being
5’10" or taller.

“l’m really looking for im-
provement in defensive and of-
tensive rebounding over last
year." Winkler stated.

Last year's leading scorer,
Stephanie Nelson, is not currently
out for the team, She broke her
ankle earlier this year. However, it
is hoped that she will recover and
be ready for play later In the
season.

The team's first game is
November 19 at 7 pm, in Darby,
