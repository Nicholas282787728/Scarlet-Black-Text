Trackers Sixth

by Dave Raub

Grinnell finished in sixth placein an

outdoor conference track meet Wh-
ich was geared ior sprinters. Be-
sides being unable to captialize
on our strength in the distance
events (most events were sprint
relays), Grinnell lost a probable
5 points when Dave Wright pulled
a muscle and couldn’t compete in
the long jump,

Earry l-Iuii, also injured, pulled
out a first in the shot put with 47’
5”. That was the end of Grinnell’s
field event scoring, Alter Jon Gray
took a close third in the high hur-.
dles, Dan Hildebrand anchored the
distance medley team (Morton, Fal—
lace, and Seeberger) to iiith place.
Hildebrand’s superb4:27.9miledid-
n’t win, but his 9:43.41 2-mile (a
personal best) was good ior iirst
place, Grinnell's ‘Zrmile relay team
(Morton, Villareal, Seeberger, and
Kennedy) cut 12 seconds from their
previous best but placed only four-
th. The 880 and mile-relay teams
ran well for fifth place in each ev-
em.

The last indoor meet of the sea-
son is Thursday, March 8, It will
be preceded by the usual PCITC
open mile run at 5:15.
