Periodical Bank Seeks New Head

by Kyle Schaub .

The ACM Periodical Bank is sh-
opping around for a new admini -
trative head, according to Period-
ical Bank director Irma Lucllt. The
now nation-wide service has be-
come too big for the ACM mem—
bers to handle effectively.

The Problem

Originally formed by the ACM
with the goal of pooling the re-
sources of superﬂuous periodicals,
the reproduction service has cle-
arly demonstrated its worth, par-
ticularly to members in Iowa and
Illinois. However, the library ser-
vice has swelled to 52 members,

Hansen Outlines New Policies

by Laura Miller

SGA began planning for the 1974-
75 academic year as PresidentJohn
Hanson outlined sugge stelipolicy ob-
jectives at Wednesday night’s meet
ing.

Proposals for action by the Joint
Boards included: revision of SGA's
committee structure, extendingfur-
um hours to all day Sunday, expan-
sion of the bussing program for
cultural events and concerts in Am-
es and Iowa City, bringing rally wa-
gons back into service for dorm
use, and continuing publication of
Faculty Evaluation Handbook. The
Student Coordinators Office plans to
focus its efforts on improving stu-
dent-faculty relations by bringing
faculty into the dorms for coffee
breaks. Progressive dinners also
were suggested as a method of pro~
mating better relations.

In further action affecting next
year’s program, administrative ap-
pointments were approved by Jaint‘
Boards. Due to the resignation of
J. C. Woods, the Student Coordina—
tors Office now consists of only
three positions held by Lynne Nu—

her (new office head), Ed Hirsch,
and Ricky Stokes. This office works
through SGA but is responsible dire
ectly to the students as a forum for
complaints. This year, the Student

Other appointments approved by
SGA include: Mike Herman, audi-
tor; Julie Eell, assistant auditor;
Dan O’Conor, treasurer; and El~
aine Jarrett secretary.

The newly designated hall repre-
sentatives’ responsibilities were
defined as: attending all Joint Bo-
ards meetings, appointing an alter—
nate if unable to attend, gathering
hall opinion on issues considered
at meetings, Serving on committees,
working with the hall coordinator,
and originating proposals.

SGA must effect the structural tr-
ans on from hall presidents to the
positions of hall representatives
and ball coordinators. Members of
the Cabinet are planning to attend
hall meetings next year to facili-
tote this change. SGA will also work
on better dissemination of infor-
mation through KDIC and SA posi—
tions.

ON DISPLAY

in addition to the 10 ACM charter
schools. Lucht stated that the ass-
ociate members, representing gr—
oups of private and public libraries
from universities, -colleges and
community colleges, range from
Florida to Oregon This situation
has caused logistic problems, which
a new structure could hopefully alle-
viate.

Advantages

A new administration could also
open associate membership to in»
stitutions throughout the US. and
Canada. Martin, president
of ACM, prposed that the new sys~
tem be organized along regional,
rather than state lines. He feels
that some libraries are superior
to others, and that members of the
Bank should be allowed to take ad-
vantage of the resources of these
libraries, instead of being forced to
remain within the bounds of narrow
and uneven state services.

According to Martin, the charter
members hope to retain their spec»
ial copy tee of 109 per page. Asso-
ciate members who do not contri-

bute to the Bank’s holding now pay
a $1 fee for the first exposure, and
20¢ per page after that.

Other Factors

Other factors have gone into the
decision to find a new administra-
tion structure. Several ACM sch-
ools, in states such as Minnesota and
Wisconsin, have access to their stat-
e»wide library networks, and donot
depend as heavily on the ACM ser-
vice as do the Iowa and Dlinois
schools. Furthermore, an Iowa sy-
stem, I-LITE, is limited to the
circulation of books and govern-
ment publications.

Grunts

It a library does accept respon-
sibility for the bank, the periodi-
cals would remain separate fromthe
library resources maintainedatthat
particular location. One worry con—
ceming the transaction involves the
grants which help support the ACM
se rvice. Lucht explained thattrans-
fer of the $123,000 in grants should
have to be approved by the ACM
board of directors before the money
could be used by the new system.
