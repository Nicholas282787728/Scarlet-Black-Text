CLARK

we presently have" Speriticallv,
Clark opposes programs for the 'l‘ '
dent submarine. the 871 bomber,
and the ABM missile system. ”We
can make very substantidlctlts in tile
detense butlgel and begin to put the
motley into socnil or httinat‘tareas.“
Tax reform is another priine cone
cel‘n of Clark 5. "l nrgtieinal where
literally thousands of Americans
earn in excess of $50,000 and $100,
000, and in some cases $200,000
a year. and pay no tederal income
tax»that we can do a good deal
better than that," Clark iinds that
"Senator Miller defends theexistlng
federal income tax code on the
grounds that these loopholes, or what
he‘d call business incentives, are
necessary tor a healthy economy i'
The final issue that Clark raised
is directly tied to the lawn senar
torial election campaign itselt.
“Senator Miller has filed $202,000
in funds with the Secretary oiStatc's
office, every dollar of which is un-
explained ..he retuses to reveal
where any ot that money came
from," Clark has been more ex-
plicit in his campaign disclosures
»“On every dollar that we’ve received
we tell exactly how much we've
collected, Where it came from, what
Occupation, and so forth. l thinkthat
every candidate ought to be prepared
to do that."

in addition to presenting his posi-
tions on all the basic issues of the
'72 campaign, Clark also related a
general perception stemming trom
his personal contact with so many
individual Iowans across the state.
“The impression that was greatest
in my mind from the walk was the

everybody's thoughts now. they

about themselves iii-st. and the peo-

Questioned on how he would be
able to "keep in touch” and re
main responsive lo his constitue
ents it elected, Clar replied, “I’d
keep walking” during recesses and
vacations “It's the most eitective
way to allow people to talk to you.”
“How can you ask people to vote
tor you to be their representative
it you haven't at least spent some
time observing what they're
concerned about. Alter all this gov
ernment doesn't belong to me or
Jack Miller or to Richard Nixon.
it belongs to every one or you,
and to every one of tiieni equally
- that’s representative democracy.”
Clark helieves that an experience
such as his can restore otie's taith
in humanity. “I never meta single

Disappearance of 'Aptt‘ilty’

hy Jack Doppeit

rhh l in nu \tli
u .o aha. lint. in

The Ocloher 16 Wall Streetlournal
introduced the budding ivied walls
of Cirilineli to the intercomrwulled
business world. The headline
awarded us thedulilousdistinctionof
being the college representative of
“Aimless America. Turning in.
ward and Growing More Moody.”

The last pathway to recognition
we walked was when Grirtnell was
chosen one of the 4'? safe places to
live, dragging with it the stigma
that any “safe place” must be as
exciting as a Nixon acceptance
speech.

president Leggett was quoted as
saying “booze is backr—and back
big” and that we drew two thousand
people at the opening tootbali game.
it these are the only upliiting by
products of the 1072 doldrums, l
am as concerned as President Legr
gett said he was.

in an election year when a cane
didate is running in response to the
galvanized mood of the ‘60’s it is
unfortunate that we have taken this
time to draw back into our cocoons,
crammed with delection, trustrae
lion, and refurbished apathy,

I used the term “apathy" speci-
fically for Don Smith, our histor
ical lexicologist (whatever that is)
Professor Smith dabbles with the
interrelation of words and the tone
of the time. it seems to me that
the overuse ot “apathy” bore a
pejorative connotation over the last
ioul‘years,andii“apathy”necomes
a societal norm, its usage will dis-

appear.
Being “apathetic" was as damage
ing to one’s character as being
labeled a iellnw-traveler in the
cos. What right did any individs
ual have to retract his orhershoulr
ders from under the weight at the
World? There was the ieeling that
quantity was important, at rallies,
meetings. and in volunteer cam-
paigns.

The adage or "either you are tor

us or against us” was a subconr
scious motivation. Any visiote non-

participanl became a detriment to
the reform movement Presidents
Johnson and Nixon could focus on
the silent apathetic and translate
them into support,

“Apathy” was probably the theme
oi more student editorials than any
other topic, including student rights.
The civil, women’s, and student
rights movements were essentially
tighting “apathy" hetore a unitied

And these movements are iarirom
consummated. l have no affection
tor the terms “apathy,” or “the
Establishment” but it their over-
use becomes intolerable, concur-

rent with dearth in social con-
cern, it is time to re-evaluate.

It is diﬂicult to Say whether the
embryonic era of social nonchal-
ance will kill the term “apathy"
because it will no longer be the
anomaly or whether the overuse ot
the term brought its inevitable aCs
ceptance as a way or lite. That is
like trying to tind the tirst wave
in an ocean.

However, tor Professor Smith and
anyone else who is aware of word
usage, it you note the disappear-
ance of “apathy" as an expression,
be prepared [or its destructive cape
ability as a social alternative.

Why Re-Elect Jack

BELL-ﬁlm

Your US. Senator?

Because he is a progressive
and responsible Senator!

 

Education—Jack Miller has voted for every piece
of education legislation that has passed the Congress
during his 12 years in the Senate—the landmark Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the
Higher Education Amendments Act of 1972 (which will
provide both institutional grants to private and public
postsecortdary institutions and substantial grants to
students from low and middle-income families), facile
ities construction (many of the buildings on your cam-
pus wouldn’t be there without this program), library
services, health professions educational assistance,
veterans education and training, and educational teler
visionAand many others,

Civil Rights—He voted for the historical Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
for cloture to end the Southern ﬁlibuster so these
measures could be voted on, for the constitutional
amendment outlawing poll taxes in federal elections,
and for Equal Employment Opportunities Commission,
its funding and continuation

Drug Abuse And Alcoholism—He voted for the
1970 Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act which
updated our federal laws, increasing penalties for pushers
and lowering those for users (marijuana use reduced to
a misdemeanor with opportunity to remove from record

in case of ﬁrst offense); and he has supported programs
for research and rehabilitation in these areas,

Tax Reform—Although the Democrats control the
House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate
Finance Committee and should receive due credit, Jack
Miller, as a member of the Finance Committee and the
Conference Committee, played an activist role in the
Tax Reform Act of 1969 and the Revenue Act of 1971,
Total net tax reduction under these two Acts for the
period 1971 through 1980 is estimated by the Treasury
Department at $140 billion for individuals and $11.5
billion for corporations—with major percentage reduc-
tions for taxpayers in the low and middle income
groups (increases for those with incomes over $100,000)
His Minimum Income Tax Amendment was adopted
by the Congress, and, as a result, individuals and
corporations with substantial income will, with rare
exceptions, no longer be able to escape paying tax. The
New York Times referred to it as “the most striking
feature of the new legislation.”

This will be the ﬁrst; time to vote for many of us.
Remember, campaign promises and negative criticism
are cheap, It’s the deeds~the record of performance—
that count!
