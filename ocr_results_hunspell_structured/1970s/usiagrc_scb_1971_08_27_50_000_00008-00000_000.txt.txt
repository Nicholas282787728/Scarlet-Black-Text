Pinball Parade

In other fall sports it should
be interesting to see when
ther Forum pinball will con-
tinue its upward spiral of
popularity. There should nOt
be the typical Grinnellprotr
lem of lack of players. Out
to an early lead is Bill
(Flipper) Dicks who has al.
ready send one machine flip'
ping into oblivion with his poi
werful attack. The squad will
definitely be hurt by the loss
of J. C. Labowitz, the George
Halas of Grinnell pinball.

Longhorn elbow- bending will
maintain its formidable po.
sition in the hearts and 510*
machs of Grinnellians, al-
though this usually leads to
another position -- lying face
down in the grass.

The greatest Grinnell specr
hater sport is likely to re
main the Floppy cartoon show
although the new hall aligns
merit hurt the Norris team.
The vitality of the Clark Hall
picture tube, which showed
signs of weakening last spring
is another question mark.

The OB’Squad half-time
show will be weakened by
losses through graduation or
otherwise of several key
freaks. The large freshman
class offers a freak potential
for another outstanding sea-
son.

Pioneer foorball fortunesare
still uncertain according to
Coach Edd Bowers. Withprac-
use not slated to begin until
Saturday there is still some
doubt as to who will even be
out for the team.

Senior triaoaptains Mario
Bognanno, Bill Dicks, andJim
Pirolli lead a corps of twen-
ty lettermen who hope to im~
prove on last year's record
of 541. The offense will have
quarterback Bill Dicks thro‘
wing to his high school team-
mate Jim Pirolli as well as
Henry Corona and Ed Hirsch.
The running chores will proV
bably be performed by Mario
Bognanno and Washington Al-
ston sharing time at the fullr
back slot with veterans Scott
Stuart and Jon Gray filling out
the backfield.

Barry Huff and Wilbur
Wright will probably start at
the offensive tackle spots tlarr
king either Mike Levy or so
phomore John Potts at center
and Rod Gieysteen at one of
the guard spots.

The defensive squad will be
led again by last year's most
valuable back Mario Bognanno
at the middle linebackingpost.
Nick Russo heads the secon~

Grid Practice Begins

dary with Jeff Dick and Ran-
dy Sarver. Dave Gitlin, Drake
Holliday, George Blakeslyand
Al Hammond, if he comes out,
are the top prospects for the
line.

The veterans provide a core
around which a conference
contender could be built. The
running backs, receivers, and
linebackers are especially
strong. The team lacks depth,
however, and will be critically
hurt if even two or three key
players don't come out or are
injured early in the season.
There will be more players
doing double duty on both of-
fense and defense. A back-up
quarterback is one of the grea-
tcst needs to be filled.

The season opens at home
against Monmouth, last year's
second place conference finir
sher, on September 18th fol-
lowed by Lawrence on the
25th. There appears to be lit-
tle change in the conference
stack- up with perennialpower
St. Olaf again favored, fol-
lowed by Monmouth, Coe, and
Ripon. Coach Bowers eX*
pressed his opinion of Grin-
nell’s chances: ”If we get
help from the sophomores,
we could be interesting."

Harrier Prospects Good

This could be the year of
the freshman in Grinnell
cross-country. Led by senior
Chuck McGrath as many as
four freshmen could break inn
to the top five before the sea
son ends, although they will
have stiff competition from
upperclassmen Phil Morales,
Scott Well, Oscar Rattenborg,
and transfer student Mark
Cochrane.

Coach Ray Obermiller exr
pects a turnout of anywhere
from 10 or 12 to 20, inclu-
ding at least 7 freshmen. Phil
Frank, last year’s third or
fourth man, is last to the team
because of a knee injury. 0
ther upperclassmen possibly
returning are JonStein, Bruce
Morrison, Paul Miller, John
Fleckenstein and Steve Lar—
rick. Freshmen expected to
come out are Tom Howland,
Dan Hildebrand, John Hesr

burg, DavidRaub, RobertTel-r

Coach Obermiller, is ops
timistic about Grinnell's
chances this year but says
that the Freshmen, always
an unknown quantity, will make
a big difference. He says this
"is the best group of fresh
men since I’ve been here."
The Pioneers go into the sea-
son opener on September 10
against Coe and Simpson with
a record of 9 straight dual
meet wins. Coach Obermiller
expects to be able to keep the
string going at least until a
late season encounter with
conference champ St. Olaf.
If McGrath can keep his teeth
in good shape and the fresh
men can make the transition
to the four mile difference
the Pioneers should be in the
thick of things come confe-
rence time.

SGA Officials Clarity House
President Role In Discussions

During the last severaldays,
Student Government has been
meeting informally in "work-
shops” for house presidents,
and some matters pertaining
to the AWS , C of HP Joint
Board’s plans for the upcor
ming year were discussed.
This will be the firstfullyear
for the new system under
which the two house presi~
dent boards together serve
the function of an all campus
senate. Thus, many of the
house presidents attendingthe
workshops questioned what
their role would be; last year
it had been said thatindividual
house presidents would have
less all campus duties than
senators.

Shelly Floyd, SGA President,
told the 5&8 that the Student
Government cabinet will cone
centrate on gathering infor-
mation for the Joint Board,
and implementing its de-
cisions. In this way, there
should be a satisfactory die
vision of responsibilities be
tween the Board and the can
binet.

Another major concern
brought up at the workshops
was the accountability of stun
dent government committees
to the board and the cabinet.
Some students feared that the
committees would too easily

become autonomous bodies,

although they are part of the

whole SUA structure and thus
responsible to the Joint Board.
According to Shelly Floyd,
efforts will be made to keep
up with the committees byrer
gular person toperson contact
by the SGA cabinet and.some
house presidents with come
mittee members. Also, com-
mittees will be called before
the Joint Board when there
are important issues relating
to the committee’s work.
"Hopefully the cabinet will
sense when an important or
touchy issue is coming up in
a committee’s work," Shel-
ly said; Then the cabinet will
bring the committee before
the joint board. Such a system
would prevent some of the dis-
satisfaction among many stu-
dents when unexpected de‘
cisions are handed down by
a committee; the housing come
mittce is an example ofwhere
this has occurred in the past.
One other idea which came
out of the workshops was that
the Joint Board would invite
Grinnell Chief of Police Bill
Peters to one of its early
meetings; students are parti-
cularly interested in hearing
fro the Chief about the pos-
sib ities for a bust, and what
the pressure for one may be.
During the school year, the
AWS - C opr Joint Boardwill
meet 9:00 p.m. everyMonday,
in the South Lounge.
