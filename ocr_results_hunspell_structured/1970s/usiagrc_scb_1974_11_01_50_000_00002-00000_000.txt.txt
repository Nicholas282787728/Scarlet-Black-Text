Caulkins, Verrette: deplore insensitivity

To the Editor:

The undersigned deplore the lack
of sensitivity demonstrated in the
letter authored by iour oi the seven
“folks at N. Coningham Rd.,
London w. 12," We regret that
participants in the program have
chosen to display such a callous
attitude toward the death of a
student. a long situation oi college-
labor conflict and the possible
presence on campus oi iederal
agents,

As ior the ambiguous description
at the London program as a
combination of concerts and oc-
casional studying, one of the
studcnts involved in the writing oi
the letter has stated that “study"
meant the traditional method of

Fobes: urges

election
activism

To the Editor'

This fall Democratic volunteers
have worked thousands of hours to
iiiiorm students and bring to their
attention the issues at men and
women running ior office. We have
tried to cut bullshit to a minimum
and present the inlormation inc
telligcntly.

The races this tall are very
important The election will
determine the type or represen-
tatives Iowa and Powcshiek
County will have for years to come,
The candidates [or national and
county oiiices are exceptionally
deserving oi our support

”Caring” at Grinncll has never
been a passive verb. Grinnell
students have gained a wellrearned
reputation ior giving meaning to
the phrase “I care” Our
willingness to act iS the reason
why. and it distinguishes us iroin
any other student boyd the Mid
West.

On Tuesday. Nov. 5, Grinncll
students are needed across the
state to help elect John Culver, Ed
Mezvinsky and other candidates, I
hope we will prove once again that
our concern is real and that it has
substance.

Bohnsack: sees Mez. bias

Dear Editor:

Organized labor has been very
good to Ed Mezvinsky this year
Earlier this summer the
Washingtun Post reported that of
all iunds labor gave to Judiciary
Committce members during the
impeachment hearings over one
halt went to Mezvinsky, Common
Cause recently reported that
Mexvinsky has received more
money irom organized labor than
all but two oi the 435 Congressmen
seeking reelection this year And
ior good measure the Micro has
printed its own campaign
literature endorsing Mezvinsky,
(The literature Warns, “if you
don't Vote—the Fat Cats \villiAnd
then we‘ll all go down the hill").

At the same time Ed Mezvinsky

has given organized labor a 100 per
cent pro labor voting record (as
rated by COPE. the political action
arm oi the AFL~CIOL
I don't think the lst District
needs or wants a Congressman so
heavily indebted to George Meany
and his way oi thinkin Our
District is made up oi diverse
interests and needs requiring
representation by one who is able
to comprehend and consider more
than one side oi an issue. Certainly
reasonable input irom the labor
sector oi a constituency is always
appropriate, But this excessive
iinancial iavoritism has put our
Congressman's ability to be ob-
Jective on behali or all his cone
stituents in serious doubt.
