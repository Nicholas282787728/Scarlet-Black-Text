FBI lndicis Ex-Grinnelliun gTed Glick
In Connection Wii'il Kissinger Conspiracy

by Krystyna Neumon

Former Grinnell student and
anti-war movement leader
John Theodore (Ted) Click,
21, was indicted last Friday,
April 30, by the federal gov-
ernment asanallegedmember
of an alleged conspiracy to
kidnap the President's nat»
ional security adviser Henry
Kissinger, blow up heating
tunnels for government built
dings in Washington, D.C ,
and remove and destroy Sel-
ective Service files,

This indictment replaced one
issued hurriedly last January
when F. 13.1. Director J.Edgar
Hoover prematurely divulged
word of the investigtion to a
Senate subcommittee. Still
named, along with seven oth
ers, is Roman CatholicPriest
Philip Berrigan but his bran
ther Daniel Berrigan, also a
priest, has been dropped from
the case. Also named isEqbal
Ahmad, a fellow at the Adlai
Stevenson Institute of Inter-
national Affairs in Chicago,
who recently spoke at Grinr
nell. Newly named, along with
Tad Click, is a former nun
and wife of one of the other
accused conspirators. The
handling of the use by the
government has become a
focal point of criticism of the
F.B.I. and Director Hoover.

Ted is presently serving an
18 month sentence for ran-
sacking offices of the F.B.I.,
U.S. Attorney and Selective
Service in Rochester, New
York, last September. In a
telephone interview this week,
Ted's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
G. Wayne Glick ofKeuka Park,
New York (Click is president
of K6uka College) said Ted
had told them over the phone
that he was “shocked” at the
news of the indictment.

Of a possible conspiracy to
kidnap Kissinger and blow up
government heating tunnels,
Mr. Glick said, "Ted told me
that there is absolutely no
basis for this. Ibelieve these

charges to be false and the
conspiracy investigation to be
part ofa larger governmental
plan to attempt to Stop the
peace movement."

Those of us who knew Ted
Click a few years ago at
Grinnell College and have
followed his activities have
watched the dramatic emer-
gence of an anti-war radical

of national notoriety out of_

the sportsdover (he was a
member of Grinnell’s wrestr
ling team) and conscientious
student that originally came to
college. But Ted had been
raised as a pacifist (his father
is a minister of the Church of
the Brethren ~ a pacifist grr

oup) and he was so affected by
the Vietnam war — according to
Grinnell College Qiaplain Der
nnis Haas, who knew Ted and
his family well — that soon
”all his thoughts were centr
ered around the Vietnam war
and his own decisions con~
cerning that war." Finally
"he couldn't do anything else
until he worked thatthrough."
This was duringTed’s second
year at Grinnell and it proved
to be his last at the college.
He was doing an independent
project on pacifism , meeting
regularly with Chaplain Haas
about it , and as Haas tells,
“out of his studies came the
decision to formulate a way

leader. Prof. John Crossett and Harry Fulton guard
the flag. (Photo by Krystyna Neutnan)

of dealing with the war."That
same year, a member of the
“Milwaukee 14” spoke at
Grinnell College and,asTed’s
mother tells, itwasTed's first
exposure to radicalism andhe
was greatly inspired by that
very first view. During this
time Ted wrote a number of
articles on the draft and the
war for Pterodactyl, Grin'
nell's underground news—
paper.

Part of Ted's newlyrdiscov~
ered personal involvement in
anti-war activities was a de-
cision to leave school and de-

vote iull-time to peace work
at the end of his sophomore

year. But the initial step was
the turningrin ofhis draft card
before a crowd in Herrick
Chapel in May, 1969 , Ted
handed it over to Chaplain
Haas who sent it on to the
draft board.

Also that spring, Ted set off
a furor in the town ofGrinnell
by turning the campus Amer-
ican flag upside down to sym-
bolize the “disastrous state'of
the nation." Several angry
townspeople appeared on wmr
pus during the incident, but
police chief Bill Peters inter-
vened and took the flag to the
police station so people could
"cool off and talk it over."
The next day, when the flag
was replaced right side up,
Ted and some other students
attempted to turn it upside
down again, but were stopped
by Grinnell Professor John
Crossett and some of his stir
dent followers. These incia
dents led to a group of Stud’
ents getting togemer to visit
townspeople to talk about the
war.

Ted's intensely moral posir
tion and commitment toaction
put off many students and fac~
ulty. While saying they agreed
with Ted, many voiced con~
cern over the risks involved
in protest actions. Ted was
often frustrated by what he
saw as a lack of any real
commitment by Grinnell peer
ple.

At the termination of the
school year, before Ted left
Grinnell College, be disrupted
the college's commencement
exercises because an honor-
ary degree was being granted
to Curtis Tarr, then newly?
appointed Director of Man-
power for the Air Force and
now head of SelectiveService.
Tarr, said to be a good per-
sonal friend of Grinnell Col-
lege President Glenn Leggett,
was just leaving as head of
Lawrence University. Ted

considered it outrageous that
the college would grant any
sort of honorary degree to
someone who was so directly
involved in the mass killings
in Vietnam. As Tarr was be-
ing introduced, Ted jumped to
the podium and read off a

“Doctorate of Inhumane Let‘
ters" degree directed at
Tarr. College Dean Joseph
Wall and President Leggett
forced Ted off the stage ,
while some parents in the
audience were yelling and
screaming at Ted.

Following his Grinnellyears,
Ted chose Lancaster, Penn-
sylvania, his hometown and
the location of his draft board,
as the working base for his
anti-war activities after he
left school. Lancaster had
been the family home before
the Glicks moved to Keuka
Park, New York, When Ted's
father became president of
Keuka College there.
According to Chaplain Haas,
Ted wanted to locate in Lanr
caster so he could be present
if and when the draft board
acted on his returning of his
draft card - and then respond
to whatever the board did. The
draft board did act, reclassi~
fying him l-A in an action
which was later declared iller
gal. Ted burned his reclassi'
fication notice and in the Fall
of 1969 he refused induction.
During this time he starteda
Draft Information Center in
Lancaster, but in January,
1970, he left Lancaster for
Philadelphia, says Haas, in
order to involve himself in
more radical anti-war aclk
vity. Aftera Philadelphia draft
board was "trashed", Ted
and a group composed largely
of Catholic priests and nuns
(among them Rev. Joseph R.
Wenderoth, another “Kissin-
ger-conspiracy" defendent)
held a press conference at the
Liberty Bell in Philadelphia
“accepting responsibility"
for the action. According to
Ted‘s father, F.B.I. agents
were in the crowd but no one
was arrested.

Ted continued to live in Philr
adelphia, but in September of
1970, he was arrested in RO’
chester, New York, alongwith
seven others for ransacking
government offices there- the
action for which he is serving
time right now. In this case,
the group , called the Flower
City Conspiracy - was caught
in the act.

While Ted was out on bail he
