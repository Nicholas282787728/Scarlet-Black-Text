Teaches, Learns In Chicago

by David Grossi

The program of student teaching in
Chicago is designed to allow students
interested in teaching to gain practi—
cal experience in an urban setting
(and to participate in some loosely
organized Sociology courses). I was
among a group of 32 students in the
program last semester. About a
third of us, including me, were in
elementary education (which is
something we don’t have much of
here), the remaining tworthirds
were in secondary education.

The ACM rents the third floor of a
Catholic grade school as a residence
for those in the program. The resi-
dence is sort 01a neoel950's struc-
ture painted in institutional pastel
with lots or sharp corners every
where. The living situation was not
particularly different from an ordi-
nary college dormity. except that
this dorm, which used to be a con-
vent, was directly above a grade
school.

i mentioned that the program in-
cludes some Sociology. The largest
room in the residence was the meet-
ing place for our classes, which con-
vened twice a week, The ACM has
hired a fellow immersed in Chicago
education to guide us through what
was supposed to be a course designed
by students. As things turned out,
however, our best classes were us-
ually when we or our guide invited
guest speakers to prod the class into
discussion.

Teaching was what we had all come
for, and we found that it absorbed
most of our energy. its the most
valuable feature of the program, and
it is also the most time consuming.
One finds that if it is successful he
gets the impression that the program
as a whole is a success. This come
pensates for the bad features of the
program. > _

The teaching experience was divi-
ded between two placements of really

equal duration, The first placement
was at a Grade School on the west
side of the city. All of us were there
for seven weeks. Those in secondary
teaching were working with the ten
through thirteen yeareolds, white the
people in elementary education were
distributed everywhere among the

other age groups,

The school was non-graded,work—
ing on some oi the principles oi in—
dividually guided education. This
was my iirst teaching experience and
I learned much from the constant
exposure to children despite the fact
that there was a good deal of un-
sound teaching golng on at this
school,

I worked on a team of fourtetichers
that was in charge of a unit of six to
eight year oldS I was one of four stur
dent teachers in the unit, which had
about one hundred children. The stu-
dent teachers were in charge of the
entire Social Studies and Science
programs for the unit, and we even
had our own classroom which we
shared throughout the day. We were
supervised very little by the teach—
ers at the school because of time
conflicts but Fred Miller, our pro
gram supervising teacher, visited
our class regularly.

Our guide had worked on a ienm of
specialists which had designed the
Social Studies program we used. The
program was actually an experimem
tal thing that dealt with the reasons
for variations in human skin colors,
and how and why people are alike and
different

The Science program, on the other
hand, was designed by a girl from
Cornell (who had a book on how to
teach Science and is a philosophy
major). The program we developed
was a combination of matchstick
mechanics and Mr. Wizzard. Even
so, the kids really enjoyed the
classes because they got to do so
many things with their hands.

At the end of our first placement
and before our second one we had a
week during which we could work on
an individual project that explored in
depth some aspect of Chicago. The
projects ranged from going to Cook
County Jail and becoming depressed
or nauseated to making phone calls
to various community groups in or-
der to make sure people registered
to vote.

Since we could do whatever We
wanted, i chose to relate to media
people for a week, I arranged to
meet with a reporter from the Tri-

bune, and also to talk to the direcs
tor of community relations for
WTTW Television. Then I visited a
couple of rather commercial ”un-
derground” radio stations, and most
interesting of all, a new and sort of
experimental Tv studio on the near
Northwest side, After we had assi-
milated the information from our
projects we met as a group to share
ideas.

Our second placements began
shortly after the end oiproject week.
They were scattered all over the
city and were better suited to our
individual quirks than were our hrst
assignments.

My placement was at the Martin

Luther King Junior Lab School in
Evanston and it lasted for about
seven weeks. Like the first place—
ment I had, the school was organized
into units of children according to
age and ability, but unlike my school
King Lab was afirst rate education—
al experience tor the children At
King Lab 1 found myself working
closely with a cooperating teacher
in her class most of the time, but
often we were all over the school.
We were spread out because the
Cougars (the unit I worked in) was
something of an “open classroom".
We had iour large rooms and a media
resource center through which we all
moved quite freely. The teachers
and student teachers divided up res»
pohsibilities for the various projects
that we did according to our own
abilities.

Some of the things l worked on with
students were making video tape
recordings and building a small
model house. Things worked out so
that small groups ofkids could work
on different things at the same time,
it was a totally remarkable school,

At the end oi the program we evalr
uated ourselves, and had confer-
ences with our advisers about what
we did during the Semester. lthink
it would be wise for anyone inter
ested in the program to know ahead
of time what kind of teaching they
want to get into, and see if it can
be arrangedlbefore they go. This way
they can avoid weird teaching sit-
nations and cooperating teachers.

Thomas: Respond To KDIC Program

by Bill Thomas \

Communication freaks of one kind
and another (engineers, professors,
etc.) have devised a sort ofparadigm
for communication. This paradigm
supposedly contains the basic ele-
ments of any communications act.
It goes: source ,_ transmitter --
channel ._ receiver 7— destination.
This breakdown actually works {air-
ly well for analyzing and comparing
different sorts of information trans-
mission, from simple talking, to
print or electromagnetic media.
However, there are a couple of
other important elements not in-
cluded in the basic paradigm.

The first is noise; noise in a gen-
eralized sense, meaning anything
which interferes with accurate or
correct movement ofthe information
between the stages. For example, if
a person who is drunk tries to talk,
the drunkenness may interfere with
his formulation of words. Thus, the
alcohol in effect would be a noise
between the source and the trans-
mitter.

The second element is feedback.
when and where feedback is present
is debatable, but it exists in some
form in virtually every communicar
tion system, in feedback, the para-
digm is simply reversed and the
destination becomes the source.
Most of that probably seems fair—
1y self»evident with a moment's
thought, but it nonetheless provokes
interesting angles if applied to some
of our communications systems. I
am most interested in radio. Radio
in our culture is 3 medium of com-
munication which operates in a very
stereotyped fashion which includes
a lot of noise, and manipulates feed-
back, to essentially commercial
ends. Radio on the Grinnell campus
has an opportunity to move outside
the stereotyped broadcast industry
style: to reduce noise and increase
feedback to the point where our radio
could make a big contribution to
increased campus (and community)

integration.

it seems that noise should be relas
tively low at Grinnell, since we are
all students or faculty, more orless,
all are engaged in some sort of acar
demics, and the vast majority of
Grinnell students are from an upper
middle class background. However,
we also have many factors Which
would tend to increase neise: we
are from different racial back-
grounds, different parts ofthe coun-
try (how many times have I heard
people say ”What’s a hush puppy?
vnu eat in"), and different types
of families Considering these sorts
oi tactors, it seems that we ought
to have a noise level a long way be
low that of an American city.

In radio, feedback represents our
most serious sytemic problem, In
American radio, people are accus-
tomed to only two or three forms
of rather indirect feedback, The
iirst two are the only important
ones, and both are passive as far-as
their feedback function is concerned
The first is the rating. Ratings are
compiled by a couple of survey ser-
vices, using pretty shnky methods.
Even the least cynical member of
the radio industry knows that ratings
have only a sort of gross relation to
reality. This feedback System con»
tains a lot of nolse, and so does the
other important one, which is com-
mercial sales of advertised pro—
ducts.

other forms feedback are phone
calls and letters, which are dis
couraged except in special situa»
tions, So, our problem at Grinnell
becomes obvious: the standardized
forms of feedback for broadcast
media are unavailable--ineflicient,
indirect, and noisy as they arenbe»
cause we can't afford to have a rat-
ing done and we have no advertised
products. Really, this is a fortunate
situation because it forces us back
on what are really better feedback
systems (better, assuming that we
are interested in something more

than selling ads). The difficulty
lies in getting people who have been
conditioned not to generate active
feedback to realize that they are
capable of doing that,

Probably the most effective form
of feedback at a station like KDIC
is the phone Call, made immediate»
1y upon hearing the bit of program—
ming which stimulates the reaction.
This feedback is discouraged at most
stations by hiding behind an exaggerr
ated expertise (“Well, yes madam,
we certainly thank you for your opin-
ion, but we have a program director
who plans these things taking into
account the latest Pulse and APE
polls along with our own projections
...). Since there are probably no
more than 6 or so people at Grinnell
who know any more about radiothan
anybody else, this expert myth is
pretty hard to maintain. But people
still don’t call nearly enough for
significant feedback to take place on
most snows.

Another form of feedback uniquely
possible at a place like Grinnell is
straight personal talk. Chances are
you will at least be acquainted with
the persons putting out program-
ming, and when you see them, you can
easily give them feedback on what
they were doing. This is also amaze
ingly little-used, Despite the low-
noise, direct feedback that is possi»
ble, little happens.

Part of the reason may be the lack
of stimulating program. Yet even
this is ill large part due to the lack
oi feedback. The main problem is the
habit of people passively accepting
whatever comes over the airwaves,
and just turning ii on il it is dis-
agreeable or boring. But this is our
radio station. We fund it, provide the
people who run it, and listen to it.
If the students, faculty and towns
people of Grinnell would start make
ing their rightful input into their
radio station, it would become vastr
ly more exci|lng, interesting, and
useful to the community

The Scarlet and Black

January 28, 1972

music. The conga background helps

“lt’s love that makes you sing/
it‘s love that makes you swing!”
These words are sung by none other ,
than Dan Hicks, the leader ofagroup ,
known as Dan Hicks and His Hot
Licks. The album of the same name
is a live concert of theirs, it's noia
new record, but it's one of the best (
albums which I’ve heard in quite a»
while.

The Dan Hicks’ sound is hard to
describe in certain respects. His
sound is unique but definitely not
in the gimmick sense oi the word.
The easiest way to describe their
style is to quote Hicks himseliand
call it “Swing". The excitement of
swing is instantly heard in their
first number, called simply, “1
reel Like Singing” This number has
an incredible bounce and livellness
rarely round in much at today’s
music. There harmonies are this
usual, with a lot of sixth and seventh
note harmonies giving the song a
swing sound, The violin solo is as
tounding. Upon hearing this first
song, you are trapped by the great
sound, amazed that a live album can
have such a periect quality to it,
while at the same timehaving sucha
“free” sound.

The fun continues with songs such
as “The Buzzard Was Their Friend”
and "Where's the Money",
“Buzzard" has that consistent driv—
lng guitar beat aiid that great swing
harmony. The same is true in
“Where’s the Money”. Hicks deftly
sings the tongue»in»cheek story line
while the girls repeat over and over
in the background, “where’s the
money” Lyrically, a strange song,
but it’s great

Swing is not the only thing Hicks
plays. ”Ride Your Pony" ls abeaua
tlful slow love ballad. Hicks himself
calls this one of his “mood num-
bers”. The harmonies and Style
remind me of some old Sweetwater

i

to create this similar sound Ans
other "imitation” Song is “Coast

0 Cast" Here, Hicks and Co, sound
ike the old Mama's and the Papa's,
n the good sense. The harmonies

are sung to perfection but it is free
lrom gimmicks or electronics

Hicks uses no electric equipment).

Some dynamite mountain stl‘ummin’
is heard in “By Hook or By Crook”.
Once again, the violinist stands out
and proves he is extremely talented.

The second side of the album is a

small letdown from the perfect sound
of the first side None Ufthe music is

bad, however All of it is a kind of

Sound that will no doubt make youset

up and listen And once you hear Dan
Hicks and His Hot Licks, you will not
be satisfied until you hear all of what
they have to otter, if we’re ever
looking ior entertainment, 1 highly
recommend finding out it Hicks and
his Hot Licks would consider trek—
ing to South Lounge, Pay him what,
ever he risks, you won’t regret it‘
ever he asks, you won’t regret it!

Bob Dylan is making the news again.
First of all, he’s apparentlyenjoyed
appearing live ever since Bangla
Desh hack in August, His latest
appearance was with the Band on New
Year's Eve, another one of his sur»
prise visits, His latest single,
George Jackson, leaves much to be
desired, however. It seems to be
such a hurried effort, almost as if
he felt he must quickly write a
“protest song” to prove he was
interested. I do believe he cares,
but his lyrics are so untypical
0f Dylan, They are weak through,
out and often banal The music is
not bad, but the song is not one of
his better efforts But it's always
good to hear irom Dylan...l’m hoping
to hear more new material. Even
Dylan is not perfectnclose, but not
periectt

Fantasy Worship In lounge

by Linda Calkins

"Fantasy" was the title given to
the reality worship by Rev. Duane
Meyer and assistant Neil Longo,
leaders of last Sunday's informal
service,

The worship, held In the South
Lounge, began with groups of two
or three of the seventeen people
getting acquainted with each other.
In our group of three, never having
met before, we discovered various
Similarities and mutual acquaintanr
ces. Following several brief min
utes of discussion we entered the
large group circle which was forms
ing at the east end of the lounge,
Duane, as he introduced himself.
proceeded to explain the process ol
fantasy With the word he gave us
we were to imagine a mcutttl pier
ture, focusing and coming in torn
close-up still sllot until we had the
images set in our minds. Alter a
minute or so of fantasy, we broke
up into small groups again to (115*
cuss the images, each time withi
diflerent group of people
The two words we were given were
church and home, many found it was
difficult to capture a still image,
but rather that constant motion was
involved in the fantasy , With these
two words as preparation we hellded
into the final fantasy, this time in-
tended to resemble a moving pic-
ture show.

The scripture verses including
Matthew 20:1715 Wale read to us as
we lay or sat comfortably on the
south lounge carpet with our eyes
closed. Previous to the reading we

had been divided into two “play
casts” with each member receiving
the role of a character in the scrips
tures. imagining ourselves in these
roles as it was read, we took ac»
count of our ieelings and reactions.

Dividing into the two “castsH with
Mr. Haas in one, Mr, Longc in the
other, and Rev Meyer keeping an
ear with each, we discussed the fans
tasy become reality oncewe became
involved, Interesting justifications
for feelings and guilt complexes
were among the two most prevalent
ieactions, at least in our “play.”

Once again we formed the large
circle, and seemingly out of no
where, Mr, Longo placed a three to
four foot gold cross in the center of
the circle, The reactions were vars
icd. Mr Haas turned the cross to
face him, Rev Meyer, opposite Mr.
Hans, did the Same. When it was
suggested that it looked like they
were lighting over it, Mr. Longo
placed it by a member oi the group,
who passed it to his neighbor.

with the cross as the subject of
the tinnl ten minutes of discussion,
we agreed to conclude the moments
of iantisy, Rev Meyer suggesting
the benediction to be in the form
desired by each intliVidual.

Duane Meyer, Des Moines, is the
associate lowa conference minister
of the United Church of Christ, also
being a human relations lab leader,
lpl‘ulesslonal member of the Asso-
ciation ol Religion and Applied Ber
haviornl Science, and a field assoc—
iate in consultation, education and
training.
