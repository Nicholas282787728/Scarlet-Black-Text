McKibbens: Twenty Years At Grinnell

by David Crow

Who gets one salary, teaches one
load, and enjoys it twice as much?
At least one of the answers is Mr.
and Mrs. William McKlbben. They
have a joint appointment, that is,
they share one faculty post, Both
seem to think the arrangement is
a good one. For the, its origins
are manifold.

It started when they were both
doing graduate work at the Univer—
sity of Chicago. Mrs. McKibben,
in addition to her academic work,
was teaching at a prep school, and
when occasion demanded, Mr. Mc-
Kibben substituted for her.

At length they were married and
Mrs. McKibben, instead of finish-
ing her doctoral dissertation, had a
child. During World War II, Mr.
McKibben said he spent his “only
26 days at Harvard", where he was
turned into ”an officer (naval) anda
gentleman”.

Alter the War, they went to the
University of Utah where they st-
ayed from 1945 until 1949. The Mc-
Kibbens then traveled to Rome under
a ruilbright scholarship, where they
remained until 1952. They came to
Grinnell during the 1953-54 acade»
mic year, and they have been here
since.

At first, it was only Mr. McKib»
ben who taught, but Mrs. McKibben
joined him in 1958, and has been
teaching on and off since then under
various designations. Since Medi»
eval Latin is her iieid, she has gen»

Freezing

Since the automobile became pop-
ular, some 250 billion discarded
rubber tires have been scattered
around the countryside. This year
alone more than 240 million will
mar the landscape.

Because the burning of old tires
pollutes the air and degredation,

Ute ace-7w,

is extremely slow, environmental-
ists have traditionally believed this
problem to be unsolvahie.

However, a new approach»—ireez-
ing--ofters hope not only oi getting
rid of refuse rubber, but also of
extracting more mileage from it.
By cooling the rubber at -30 de-
grees iarenneit, researchers at the
University of Wisconsin have shown
that the tires can be instantly ira»
gmented when passed through a ham-
mer mill. Once the tires are bea-
ten into a powder, the components
can be efficiently separated and ev-
entually reused.

eraily taught the Introductory Latin
classes, The first year of the coup-
le’s joint appointment was 1371.
Both seem satisfied with their
employment arrangements. Al—
though .the work load varies
back and forth in different sem»
esters depending on what cour»
ses are being taught and who is re—
sponsible for what, they have found
that it gives each of them an in»
volvement in professorial matters
but does not consume so much of

‘their time as to limit their con-

cerns only to their yobs.

As Mr McKibben said, ”1 told the
Dean when I accepted the appomt»
ment that I wasn’t going to use the
extra time to write a book or do
research; I feel it makes me
a better teacher not to he so to»
tally involved in my work.”

During their time at Grinnell, the
McKibbens have watched the Clas»
sics department and the school as
a whole grow and change. When Mr.
McKibben first started teaching, Cl-
assics was a one-man department,
and during the 1950’s averaged only
about two majors per year.

Now, the staff has grown to tour,
with an average often mayors. The
greatest boost in enrollment {or the
department occurred when the last
speciﬁc course requirements, in-
cluding a language requirement,
were dropped during the 1970-71
school year.

Grinnell, during the McKibben's
early years here, had a total Stu»

dent body of between 700 and 1300.

There was, of course, the infam»
ous division oi'the College into
North Campus, exclusively for men,
and South Campus, likewise for wo»
men.

At that time, about one-third ofthe

student's total course schedule was
laid out ior him, in the required
courses of the basic “core” cur—
riculum. Mr McKibben expressed
a certain ambivalence about the
change' from this system to the
present.
_“To a certain extent, that system
was workable, and yet at that time
we had a more positive conception
oi our duties. We, as professionals,
were supposed to have some idea
of what education was all about.
The student came here and paid
his money for that expertise. We
thought that this was part of the
difference between a liberal-arts
college and a big university which
is like a gigantic cafeteria, where
the student helps himself.”

Asked what kept them here, the MC»
Kibbens replied that they liked Grin»
nell ior its size and the advantages
this brings with it, and for its rural
setting with its somewhat more re~
laxed pace.

And the College makes up in large
measure ior the allegedly superior
intellectual stimulation of the city.
A more relaxed life style is allowed
by their ioint appointment, and the
McKibbens view it as a very pro—
mising innovation in teaching.

Assists Reclamation

Norman Eraton, director of the
Wisconsin research project and
vice-president of Cryogenic Recy-
cling international, Inc. has pro-
mised to have a mobile cryogenic
(low temperature) recycling unit
ready ior demonstration by June.
As planned, each unit would ride
on the hack of a Clo—loot truck and
service,_ tire dumps over a-large

area. After cooling the tires with

liquid nitrogen, the proposed unit
would pass thirty tires a minute
through a hammer mill, shattering
them into rubber, fabric, and wire.

Braton estimates that twenty oi
these ireezer crushers operating
continuously five days a week would
be required to keep abreast of the
current tire problem. However, an
attack on the enormous tire backlog
would require a ileet. This problem
is compounded by the fact that
each of these devices might cost
$10,000.

Braton is optimistic that he will
be able to find a market for the
recycled tire materials. He points
to the use of rubber as a bonding
material in asphalt highways. Ari»

Student loans Salvaged

by John Wylie

The Senate voted late Wednesday
to continue funding for three ex»
isting student aid programs instead
of switching to an administration-
backed plan.

The voice vote was seen both as a
rebuff to President Nixon and a vic-
tory for heleagured financial aid oi-
ficers at colleges and universities
across the nation.

Upon learning of the action, Dean
of Student Financial Aid D. Nicholas
Ryan exulted, “This is perfect.
It’s exactly what we wanted and
needed”.

He explained that Wednesday’s Se»
hate action, and earlier action in
the House, was of an emergency na-

Under the amendments passed by
both houses, the current Student
loan programs will be continued at
the same funding level they nowhave,
$872 million.

The measure must still be approved
by the President. Although Nixon
opposed it, it is still unclear whee
ther or not he will veto the bill.
Ryan explained that Grinneil stu»

the idea. Tire fabric is also under
consideration as a filler for plas-
tics.

The pollution free cryogenic pro»
cess is so versatile, says Braton,
that it could be used to reclaim any»
thing that becomes‘brittle when fro—

Agency is interested in testing this
process for separating the metals
in beverage cans. In addition, Uni-
versity of Wisconsin researchers
expect to recover valuable metals
from used power and telephone
transmission cables.

$350 Aid Funds Raised

by Terry Wolt

Events to raise funds for aid to
Vietnam and lndochina raised over
$350 in the past two weeks, accor»
ding to sponsors of “Pizza ior
Peace" and a bake sale.

The “Pizzas for Peace” sale, held
two weeks ago, netted $7.36. About
l75 pizzas were delivered from four
makeshift pizzerias on campus and
one located in the kitchen of Richard
and Leigh Kagan.

Ellen Kistler, an organizer of the
bake sale, said she was "very ple-
ased” with the contribution cloaked
goods and the $149 collected. The
bake sale, held last Saturday and
Sunday, capitalized on the frustra—
ted, hungry crowds that gathered

ago in which students, iacuity, and
townspeople agreed to join the Am-
erican Friends Service Committee

Proceeds from the “Pizzas for
Peace" sale, however, went to Med»
