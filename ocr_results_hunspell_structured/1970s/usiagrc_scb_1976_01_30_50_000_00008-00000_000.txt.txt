At 1: ohm Wednesday morning,
a soft noise could probably be
heard echoing across the campus.
The Grinnell varsity basketball
players were collectively sighing
relief as they arrived home from
Knox.

And who can blame them? They
had Just finished the part of the
schedule that forced them to play
ion of their lirst twelve games on
lhe road. During that stretch, they
compiled an unexpectedly poor 2-

Seven ofthe Ploneers' remaining
eight games are at home, the first
being tonight against the Beloit
iuccaneers at 7:30 pm , who are

of grapplers suffered two defeats
last Week. The first of these was to
be expected as Drake was the
opponent Hunt, who owed Drake a
match, took the Grinnell wrestlers
to Des Moines to tackle the
Bulldogs where they were beaten
by a lopsided score of 500, Hunt’s
only comment wan that they were
out of the Pioneers’ league, but
that the match was a good EX~

Last Weekend the matmen of
Grinnell went to the Beloit Ins

schools and Grinnell finished a
poor ninth. This was disappointing

The highlight of the Knox dual
was Virginia Munoz's swim in the
ZOO-yard treestyle. Her time of
2:16,8 established a new school
record, Others receiving praise
from Daley for their performance
last weekend included Jean Allan
and Renee Reichart. Besides the
fine backstroke races turned in by
the pair from Rochester, Mn.,
Reichart also won the diving.
