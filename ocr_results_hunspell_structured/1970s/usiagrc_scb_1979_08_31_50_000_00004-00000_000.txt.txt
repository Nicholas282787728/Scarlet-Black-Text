0"“6 Some new faces. some old issues

by Pool Schwartz

As the new academic year gets
underway this week, the SGA stafi is
readying itselt tor the iorthcoming
semester. It continues to focus on
many of the same points which were
left unsolved at the end of last year,
while simultaneously dealing with
newly developing issues.

The new staff, under the auspices of
President David Kramer, includes
George Turnbull as vice president,
Melissa l-lopp as student coordinator,
Chris Nylander as student auditor,
and Ruth Pagami as administrative
assistant and election board chairper-
son. There are also three assistant
coordinators and an assistant auditor.

In explaining his agenda for this
year, Kramer opened with the pet
policy. As it stands, there are no dogs
allowed anywhere on campus and cats
are only permitted on lloors that vote
unanimously in favor of them. Kramer
said he will fight in favor of a more le-
nient pet policy, claiming that “we
have to decide once and [or all what
will happen with pets. it's been dragg-
ed through too many years.”

Kramer expressed dissatisfaction
with the bathroom policy voting pro-
cedure, explaining mat last year “one
person could force two ﬂoors to walk
up and down, disenfranchising an en-
tire floor."

Director of Admissions John
Hopkins has previously claimed that
there would be a problem placing
freshman students if there were no
single sex options. Kramer claimed
that this “reasoning just doesn‘t hold
water. . . Consequently, we'd like to
resubmit that policy (loosening the
laws which restrict coed bathrooms)
and demand a firmer reason why it’s
not acceptable and can’t be worked
a“ it,

On the confusing issue of the “F”
grade, Kramer vowed to make a
“number one commitment" to stop its
return. It had been drawn up and
amended last semester but was never
implemented because no date was
ever set to activate it.

He also commented that he con-
sidered the current foodsfight policy
too strict and would like to make it
more equitable.

Regarding the alcohol situation on
campus, Kramer stated, “Alcohol is il-
legal to 15 year oldsithat’s the pro-
blem." He would like to see Grinnell
pool resources with several other Iowa
campuses to lobby the state
legislature when it reconvenes. Grins
nell has an intership program in Des
Moines which he hopes to get involved

in lobbying [or a change in the drink»
ing law.

When asked about skip day, Kramer
replied “There will be a skip day this

semester. betore it gets cold and

beiore the work gets heavy. We want
everybody to be able to participate
this year."

One main project which SGA plans
to initiate this year will be the
establishment oi legal services tor oii
campus students who encounter dil-
ficulties with their housing leases.
“We'd encourage any people living on
campus to contact us (SGA) in an 61'»

iort to get a tenant union proposed.”
Kramer added.

SGA also plans a push to obtain
overnight sleeping [acilities at the
Health Center and will encourage the
option oi trained care 24 hours a day.

Kramer pointed out that SGA, the
Committee on Student Lite, and Joint
Board need to work together suc-
cesstully this year He also stated, on
behalf of the entire SGA staff, that
they are looking forward to working
with President George Drake and are
expecting a productive year.

Phoenix ‘F’ grading back

on the agenda

by Senna Beaupartqnl

Last May, the Grinnell administra
tion proposed a change in die grading
system which would reinstitute the
“F” grade. The taculty drew up, and
later amended. a proposal in favor of
the “F” grade last semester. Due to
ambiguities, a date was never set for
implementation, and the proposal
died.

“There was too much proposalr
building and some of the amendments
were contradictory," commented
Dean Waldo Walker.

Thus, the controversy over the
grading system has become an issue
again this year.

At the special faculty meeting last
May, students Margo Calvetti and
Peter Kornhaber gave statements
representing student reaction against
the proposal,

Calvetti made the following com-
ments as a protest to the “r” grade in
the name at liberal arts education: 1)
an unrestricted curriculum was a ma-
jor reason for attending Grinnell; 2)
Grinnell offered alternatives to other
modes at higher education; 3)
students do not want to mirror society
with respect to grades/SAT scores; it
would lead to decreased attempts to
take courses outside the major area;
4) students on the Curriculum Com-
mittee had voted against the proposal;
5) the ﬁnancial sources had not been
considered; parents should have been
asked, since it would not be fair to
them to pay for “F5”; 6) a [acuity
vote tor the proposal would dictate

control over the students; 7) as a solu
tion to the already-passed “F" grade,
activation should be delayed, with
students requesting an open forum in
the fall {or discussion at the proposal.

Kornhaber noted that students were
encouraged to diversity, but “F5"
would negate willingness of students
to take courses and lead to anxiety
and fear which are not conducive to
learning.

Dean Walker, on the other hand,
argues that with the current grading
system more students are dropping
out now than when the “F” grade was
in effect,

“Students end up dropping courses
and thus lose a lot of credit. There are
some students who are dismissed
because they have not met the
minimum requirements ror credits. it
the “F" grade were put into effect,
students would pay more attention to
what they are doing ”

Walker said that it is not the ”F”
grade he is interested in, but some
kind of guideline which will be an in
dicator of how well the student is do
ing He also added, “I suspect we are
not packaging our product in terms of
honesty and packaging law it we do
not speciiically tell the parents what it
is costing them every time their
son/daughter drops a course
(3761.00),”

Walker is planning to hold an open
forum for discussion of the ”F" grade
proposal sometime this tall, giving
students and laculty a chance to air
their opinions.
