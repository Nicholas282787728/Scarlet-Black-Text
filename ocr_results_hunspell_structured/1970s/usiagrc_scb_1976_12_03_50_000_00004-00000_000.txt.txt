Mr. Murphy was busy typing
away as I entered his paper strewn
office. Though it was 5 pm. and
cold and dark outside, Mr. Murphy
was obviously still diligently at
work. After his first 30 days, he
feels just like any other ireshman:
overworked, But Mr. Murphy is
enjoying Grinnell, both the College
as well as the town community.
Again, like other freshmen, the
new vice president has iound that
just being here truly can he a
learning experience: he is learning
from his job as he grows into it.

Murphy's basic position is lhat oi
a iund raiser. Primarily he
acquires resources by initiating
development through interaction
with all those wealthy, successiul
alumni we are always hearing

used by all departments, and is
exctted by the new possibilities
which present themselves in the
renovation. Part of the lab will
serve as a classroom, seating up to

lilm projectors, video tape
monitors and televisions. Another
part oi the any lab will have a short
wave radio and a cassette copier
The third part of the lab will serve
as a language lab with is “live”
carrels and a listening stations.
The lab will be open irom s a.m.
until 5:30 p rn. Mr, Verette is
certain the new auditrvlsual
department will enhance the
present operations.

Mark Grundler, the head man at

What Grinnell has done is to hire
David Murphy to act as a public
relations man, dispenser of in-
formation, and fund raiser. By
dispensing information and by
“selling” the viability of the
College, Murphy hopes to increase
the flow of dollars into the
College's budget. In this manner,
the endowmcnt will grow, in-
creasing its interest, which means
better limes for all involved,

dispersed throughout campus.

been oiiered by an anonymous
alumnus.

The computers are presently

students. Rush Medical program
students, ior example, can
simulate ailments on the computer
and then see how heartbeat and
blood pressure are aiiected.
Grundler said that in the past year,
student use of the Computers has
risen almost 100 per cent. About
onerlhird of the student population
uses them. This number is ex
pected to rise even iurther in the
near future.

Grundler feels that “all students
should be exposed to computers
because once they leave Grinnell,
they will all, eventually, have to
deal with them." By purchasing
the 11-70 computer, Grundler
belleves that “we're giving the
College everything it needs."

convinced of the utility of his
liberal arts education, Mr, Murphy
believes strongly that there is still
a demand for a college where a

Grinnell properly tempers its
liberal arts emphasis by offering a
number oi appropriate oiicampus
programs. This offcampus study

the practicality of one’s Grinnell
