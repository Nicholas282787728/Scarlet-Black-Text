iaculty willi respect to this oitice.

Assistant Dean Mrs Marjory Daley
noted that there was an increasing dee

pietion or studies at Crinnell It seems
ttiat many students would rather work
or get into other programs,

Prudence hiilite. a resident advisor
who is working extensively with the
Career Services program here, noted
that Grinnell students on the whole

but in “aliernaltve” vocations Both she
and Marjory Daiy requested iaculty help
in compiling a resource book iorstudeht
use that would list skills, work experis
ences, apprenticeship programs and
other vocational areas in which iaculty
members have some knowledge

Mr. Klntncr informs thC faculty at Monday‘s meeting that
he will be distributing copies of a motion to them for ac-

tion at the next meaning.

vices Ann whiter disagreed and stated
that there are many students who do not
necessarily want to continue in acne
demics and are unaware or what they
could do with their liberal arts educa-
tion. Ttie Career services Oiiice could
alter alternatives to such a student
There wasagencral understanding alter
the report that at this point students are
no longer solely graduate school oi‘ir
ented and that this indicated thatcrinnell
should oiiera more comprehensive vocite
tional service than it has in the last iew
years.

Memorial Resolutions

Other business included the endorse-
ment of memorial resolutions for Pros
Tessors Collard and Hunter, an indicﬂr
tion of conceen about the position 0‘
the Executive Council and continuation
oi discussion on the iaculty reorganiza-
tion proposals.

President Leggett noted his concern
about the lack or communication between
the Executive Council and thetacultyand
introduced one means or partially allev»
iating this, The Chairman oi the iaculty
could give a report at each iaculty meeie
ing on the activities or the Council and
other iaculty members on the council
could clarity the report. The report
could be very unsubstantial since so much
or what happens in the council has to do
with coniidential personnel questions.
The report given at Monday's meeting
by Mr, Clottelter added nothing to what
had already been distributed in the mine
utes. Mr. Leggett plans to take the idea
to the Executive councillor claritication

Admi ‘slrative Bureaucracy

The discussion on one oi the iaculty

sit on the Executive council to 2 years
in 5--brought with it someconcernabout
administrative bureaucracy and the pri-
mary role oi proiessors The motion
itseli was deieated, but from the dis-
cussioii it seems ttiat though political
motives were also involved. some pro-
tessors are couceriied that the admini-
strative dutics oi the iaculty can usurp
the teaching duties and that, although
both are iinpoitant, the latter is the
primary put pose oi the iaculty

Reviews Econ Policy

Tuesday alter-neon the Friars, a group
oi senior men with high grade~point
averages, sponsored an iniormal lecture
and discussion program centering around
President Nixon’s new economic pro-
gram. The key speaker was Robert F.
Voertman, Prolessor oi Economics Mr
Voertman concluded that the novel ele-
ment oi the Pi‘estdent's new program was
the adoption oi an administrative system
to keep wages and prices in check, He
said that it was not, unioi-tunateiy, a move
toward socialism, but rather a spill in
corporate economics that is required by
the present situation

Mr Voertiiian began by outlining what
is new about the President's ”New
Economic Policy,” There is suprisingly
little. Mr. Nixon has asked ior tax cuts
to stimulate business investment and
spot the creation or jobs. in cenain ecu»
iiomic situations in the pasttliis has been
tried, and it has worked eiiectively, but
Voertman does not believe that those
conditions are the same today. in this
light he considers the tax cut a political
move

The second major element oi the Pres—
ldent's plan is the imposition oia [our
percent tariii on all goods coming into
the united states, combined with ireezing
the convertability oi the dollar These
moves are designed to stop the outilow
oi dollars which has resulted inasevere
balance oi payments deiicit iora number
oi years, and, which, more importantly,
has caused a negative balance oitrade

PROPOSALS nun moi

in their proposal, the group states that
they completely reject any iorm oigrad-
ing system “Grades create an unhealthy
atmosphere oi compel 'oh Further
more, any vestige or the presentgrading
system will carry llle"gradecon5€lous~
ness in any new system, Grades create
reeliiigs oi inierinritv in siudents."

The group concludes, "The viscious
circle must be broken somewhere We
can't ask, ‘Wllnt do the grad schools
want/7' We must ask, What will create
a better educational environment?‘ "

Next week, Donna itotlieiiberg will liroe

pose an extremely ﬂexible alternative

which would allow students to choose-
grade»erase, credit-erase (with a grade
listed only in the Registrar's 0iiice and
released only witli student permission),
evaluation—erase, or credit erase with
no grade listed with the Registrar's Dir»
ice,

Under her proposal, a student may die
ect one oi these options ior his entire
stay at orinnell, or may elect a diiier-
ent plan ior each course taken

i-ier proposal is made so that “all
students at Grihnell may be allowed to
choose the evaluative system under wh-
ich they will work duringtlieii-iour years

are a rather old game, and seemto come
and go depending on the whims oi the
domestic corpoiations. The tarili, along
with the iloating dollar, are viewed by
most economists us liartirlllie measures
that the U, s. will use as negotiating
points in an attempt to get a more iavor-
able tialance oi trade

The most dramatic action oi the Press
ideal, the wagerprice ii-eeze, also has
been used beiore Pricesanduageswere
iixed during three oi the tour wars in
this century and the new action can be
seen as a method to oii set the demands
oi the present war.

However, Voertman believes that a
closer correlation can be round in the
establishment oi the NRA during the
Roosevelt administration The great
number oi wage and income regulating
boards, which the President has planned
ior phase ii oi his program, representa
commitment to the idea that the economy
must be controlled by the government.
Unlike the NRA, this program will pro-
bably not be [oulid unconstitutuional, be—
cause both industry and labor are giving
the program their support

Voertman commented that hadthis pro-
gram been proposed by a “radical” or
even a “liberal" it would probably have
been branded as socialism or com—
munism by the business community.
Mr. Nixon, as a representative oi‘busis
ness interests, was capable oicreating
the necessary program

Although the program is not new, iir,
Voertman believes that it is a major
departure ior U.S. economic policy it
is simply “the end oi laissea-taire
in America.” The President has made
it clear that he intends to keep the
better elements oi the iree market
economy, but it seems that business
and labor will now be negotiating con-
tracts and price changes through gov-
ernment boards, which they control.

in Voertman’s estimation the new pro»
gram will probably not aiiect the major
problems in the u, s., particularly the
high rate or unemployment To show

' that he was not taking his iniormation

iroin secondary sources Voertman
showed the audience an explanation oi
the new program (that he said had been
sent by the White House) The iolder
was signed on the treat page by the
President's press secretary Voertman
speculated that the contents oi this
report might be biased in iavor oi.the
new program. ' '

This lecture was the iirst his series
oi iniormal discussions oi important
current events, which are being planned
by the Friars.
