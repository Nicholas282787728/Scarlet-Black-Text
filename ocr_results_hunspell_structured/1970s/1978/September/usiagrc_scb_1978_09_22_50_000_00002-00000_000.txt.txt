Housing situation improves

by Jim Call

The crowded housing situation
on campus is apparently imr
proving, according to housing
director Susan wittpenn.

Wittpenn was unable to give an
exact Count of Students still in
temporary housing since the
situation “changes every day," but
estimates that there are nine
students in “really crowded
conditions” and another 20 in study
lounges or other areas that are not
normally rooms She hopes to have
all students in one-room triples
(three people in a double) moved
into permanent hou ' by today,

MOST STUDER already
placed in permanent housing were
relocated soon after school started
“because people did not Show;
freshmen just didn't come, up
perclassmcn Withdrew at the last
minute, somc people withdrew
atter beinghere a day or two. and
some juniors and seniors moved olt
campus " When rooms become
available, they are assigned to
students, With students in the most
crowded conditions given priority

Wittpenn would set no date as to
when all students would be in
permanenthousing. She states that
those in study lounges may remain
there all year. adding “some ot
them want to stay there." Study
lounges converted into rooms are
located in Clark, Mears and
Younker. Those lounges now being
used to house Students will be
converted back into study lounges
when and it they are emptied

WITTPENN ADMITS SIIE has
received complaints from some
students about the temporary
housing, Some feel the situation is
getting worse—it was fine tor the
first week or two but now they are
getting tired of it. in some cases
the extra roommate has caused
problems. Students have remarked
that the departure oi the extra
roommate eased much of the
tension. Wittpenn added that
