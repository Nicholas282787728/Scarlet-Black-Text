Curriculum. . .zzz?

”Curriculum” is a boring word,

It does not call forth to mind any concrete images, except
maybe that of a college catalog. One would not utter the
word at a social gathering and then expect to be the life of
the party. It is not a word‘that generally generates much
excitement on campus, or anywhere else for that matter.

It should. Because “curriculum” is just about the most
important word confronting Grinnell students today. If you
believe that your primary purpose for spending four years
here is to get an education, then this word should become an
immediate part of your vocabulary.

“CURRICULUM" and “EDUCATION" are intimately
tied. A major change in the curriculum would significantly
alter the quality of education at Grinnell. And such changes
are currently being considered.

Would you like Grinnell to institute distribution
requirements so that every student must take at least two
courses in each division? Do you favor requiring every fresh»
man to take one required course—Humanities 101, say? Do
you believe students should continue to be allowed to choose
all their own courses, or do you think a balanced course load
should be achieved at the expense of free choice? Should a
“liberal arts education" he left up to the inclinations of each
individual, or is there an unchangeable meaning of the term
“liberally educated” that everyone must conform to'.l

These questions are presently being considered by the
faculty, and some changes may be in store. Students should
be aware of the present debate, and should give the matter a
great deal of thought. Finally, students should be prepared
to contribute to the discussion and make their feelings
known to the faculty. Although this is essentially a faculty
decision, thoughtful student opinion is important,

The subject of curriculum change should be discussed
openly and often. A student-faculty dialogue is of the ut-
most importance.

Mears. . .what next?

People have been grumbling this week. No one seems too
pleased. “How can they tear down Mears‘l How can they add
a floor to Norris? How dare they?”

The answer is, very easily. Grumhlings are all,very well
and good, but unless a concerted effort is made to comr
municate our feelings to the trustees. they will proceed with
their plans as though the matter had never come to the
public's attention. Some action must be taken,

MANY THINGS COULD BE done. The SGA. as the
representative body of the students, could send a letter to
the trustees expressing displeasure, including reasons why
Mears should be saved. They could circulate petitions in the
post office. An ad hoc committee could be formed to bring
speakers to the campus lsee letter to the editor this issueli
coordinate a letterrwriting campaign and contact alumni and
parents to enlist their aid. The college depends on alumni and
parents for financial support—their opposition to the
proposed plans should prove powerful,

As long as dissatisfaction remains at the grumbling stage,
nothing will be done. It must be channeled into some form of
action if Meats is to be saved.

Letters to the editor

Architectural preservation expert says Mears can be saved

To the editor: tNovember l3,
mm This weekend my daughter
and I are visiting prospective
colleges Before my daughter
selected Grinnell I discussed your
college with a friend of mine who
graduated from Grinnell In the
1950's. He commented to me,
“Grinnell is first rate, bull do not
think you will be too impressed
with the campusiil is nol very
old.”

Upon my arrival here yesterday
I was pleasantly surprised by the
variety and excellence of your
campus archltecture, and l was
particularly pleased by the
quantity of late lBKhVGarly 20th
century buildings. Your campus is
truly beautiful and balanced from
the perspective of an architectural
historian and conservator of our
mammade environment.

LAST NIGHT I happened upon
the Nov. 10 issue of the Scarlet 8
Black. and was shocked to learn
[hat your trustees are con-
templating razing your sccolld
oldest slructurcl This morning I
inspected and appraised the
building, Mears Cottage can easily
and inexpenswcly be preserved for
adaption or reuse.

i am speaking from Considerable
experlence of at least two decades
of rehabilitating and reusing
historic structures for adaptive use
or continuing rerusc. In my
profesSlonal opinion as a real
estate developer, manager pl
numerous adaptively-used historic
buildings lsuch as Boston‘s 1866
Old City Hall comprising 90,000
gross square feet to numerous
projects the same SIZE as Mears
Cottage), and as adviser to the
National Trust for Historic
PreservatloniNew England
Regional Representative, the
trustees who are advocating
demolition are ill~nd\-ise'd. They
are not getting information and
feedback from the National Trust
or professionals such as'myself.
More importantly, they are not
exposing the issue to the alumni,
student body. faculty and general
Grinnell community of parents,
neighbors, etc, for their con
sideration. discussion and input.

Grlnnell is to be congratulated
that these issues of preservmg our

discussed, In contrast, the trustees

Aside from the issue of the plan

question which has been so far
overlooked Why add any more
dorm space at all7 I realize that
there is a current shortage of on

mum of college policy

Till-:nl-J .\ MORE central
issue here: why not let lnore

available dormitory space is filled,
and that is obviously not a problem
at present, what is so bad about
having more Students live off
campus7

The stated position of the college
in the catalog l5 essentially that
this is a residential college which
seeks to preserve a campus
community. But let's get real:
letting more people off campus is
not going in lracture the com
munity and turn Grinnell College
into a commuter school.

AFTER ALL. WHERE else do
off-campus students have to go for
something to do than the campus?
As it is. a lotof offrcampus students

pressure by alumni, students,
friends of the College and a Small
but unrelenting core group of
faculty‘sludents-alumni did the
president and trustees allow the
issue to be widely debated and

that after the issue was publicized

trustees and friends of the college

recently relnforced by the rejec-
llon of the SGA alcohol policy, that
the administration does not trust
us to act like responsible adults.

If [his is the case. it is really
amazing. Consider the lip service
paid by the college in the catalog to
treating us like responsible citizens
and the fair amount of academlc
selfrdclcl‘lninatlon we enjoy here,
Consider further the fact that most
of us are in fact legal adults enc
Joying all the rights of adulthood
lbarring the new drinking age),
and as such have Ihe right to ch
peCl to be treated like adults

lT ls IlllPtiRTinT to note that if
we insist on being treated like
adults We must assume adult
responSIbility. Le. act like adults,
Unfortunately, i fear that there are
some students who prefer to be
taken care of. who don‘t want adult
responsibilities and would prefer to
be treated like children The locus
of responsibility lies as much with
the Students in this matter as it
does with the administration.

This is taking us a bil far afield of
the question of campus housing
policy. Why ls ll. necessary for
students lo be required to live on
campus alter their first year here?
This is, lor me. a largely academic
quesllon since (a) I already live off
‘campus. and lbt I am graduating
(I hopel at the end of the Semester.

HOWEVER. THIS is a Worthy
issue for those who bemoan the
lack of Student activism, True, it
does not have the radical glamour
oi boycotting Nestle, the South
Africa issue and other Third World
issues This is simply a matter
which affects the life of every
student here.

Whether you are more concerned
with [he planned destruction oi
Mears, the campus housing policy
or the school treating us like kids.
one can no longer complain about a
. lack of issues.
