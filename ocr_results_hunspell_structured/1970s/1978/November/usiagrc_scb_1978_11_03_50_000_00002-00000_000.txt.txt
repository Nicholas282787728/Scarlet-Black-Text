Journalist Smith speaks on Russia

by Anne Rawland

Hedrick Smith, chief of the
Washington bureau of the New
York Ti nrcs, presented a picture of
life in Russia. the Russian
character and the problems or
being a journalist in the Soviet
Union in his speech Wednesday on
“The U S and the Soviet Union:
Breaking the News Barrier."

According to Smith. the Soviets
operate ona system of “Censorship
at the source,” He commented,
“Foreigners live in ghettos where
guards regulate who comes in or
goes out " The most dillicult part
about reporting was learning how
to gain access to the Russian
people to learn how the society
really functioned. he said.

VERY OFTEN the Russian
people are unaware of major
events because of strict censorship
laws. When Nikita Khrushchev
died, nothing appeared in either or
the two Moscow newspapers for 36
hours and then only one sentence at
the bottom of the page told of the
event. “Russians learn to read
their newspaper from back to front
and bottom to top.” laughed Smith.
“The smaller the Story the greater
its importance.”

In the Soviet Union, he com-
ments, press conferences, daily
briefings and open knowledge of
what goes on in the legislative
process are unheard of. However,
he noted. “Nothing we (foreign
reporters) write is censored. They
( the government) only try to
harass or intimidate you, publicly
or privately."

SMITH CLAIMED that contrary
to popular belief, once a person
breaks the cultural barrier he
begins to get to know the people on
a personal level He found that
“They are the warmest, most
friendly people I've ever met,
friendlier than those of any other
country.” Smith added that the
best way to get Russians to open up
is to sit and drink With them. ”They
treat all journalists as spies, but if
you are willing to let your
inhibitions down by drinking you
mustnotbeavery bigor important
spy." he commented.

Because of the strict censorshiD,
Smith stressed, “Life is dual. They
have a political and a home life."
In private life the Russians are
“moral jaywalkers. They have no
organized Mafia but the extent of
corrupn'on is great." The people
often bypass official and legal
channels.

ACCORDING TO Smith apr
proximately 30 million people still
attend Church services at least
once or twice a year. “It's mostly
older women." he noted, “but it's
funny how there are always new

older women to replace the
generation that dies off. Ap-
parently the younger women just
wait until they're old enough that
the political system has given up
on them.”

During the question period which
followed his speech Smith stated

that he ieels the Soviet government

|S obsessed with secrecy because it
can't afford to have anything go
Wrong with what the leaders
proclaim is a “perfect” ideology.
But. more importantly, he feels the

Soviet Union harbors a real Sense
or “being number two. They feel
they are inferior so they cover
everything up.”

ON THURSDAY Smith con
ducted a workshop for interested
students. His appearance on
campus was funded by a grant of
$12,000 from Time-Lite Cor-
poration as part of the Time-Life
Journalism Program, Tom Wicker
of the Times and Howard Simons of
the Washington mm were previous
speakers.

Turner: no alcohol funds

by Marikay Kameczura

President Turner decided
Monday to approve the Committee
on Student Lile proposal that
prohibits college funding of
alcohol. Turner emphasizes he had
no choice but to accept the CSL
position as a result of the change
in the Iowa legal drinking age
from 18 to 19. The alternatives
would risk the college incurring
liability for supplying alcohol to
minors.

“I am acting on what our
lawyers are telling us,” Turner
asserts. “It's not a question of
choosing one proposal over
another. The problem is a legal
one.”

LAST WEEK IN Des Moines,
Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman consulted a second

college lawyer who found no
feasible options to the new law. In
addition, Tederman met with
deans of other lowa colleges to
discuss the possibility of lobbying
for a change in the law, but he
encountered little enthusiasm for
the idea.

Tederman attributes their lack
of interest to Grinnell’s unique
position among Iowa colleges.
Grinnell is one of the few schools to
use student government funds for
the purchase of alcohol and one of
the few in which the majority of
students are not drawn from Iowa.

THE INCREASE in the legal
drinking age has generated
widespread support among con:
stituents in this state, and colleges
that are predominately composed
of Iowans would be “cutting their
admission olfices’ throats if they
acted to try to change the law,"
Tederman says.

sen President Greg Youtz
agrees with Turner and Teder—
man’s assessment of the situation.
He acknowledges, “I can't really
object to President Turner‘s
decision. He didn't have any other
choice"

THE APPROVAL of the CSL
proposal will not affect Saturday 5
Loose Hall Ball since a bringvyour-
own~bottle system had previously
been established for it.
