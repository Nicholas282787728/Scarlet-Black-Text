Robbery leaves many questions unanswered

by Dan Flymi
Along with the coming of spring
weather, Grinnell has also ex»
perienced an increase in campus
thefts. Often, the thefts occur when
dorm room doors are left open. But
in one case, the circumsmnces
a bit more complex,

Three weeks ago, .iim Finn

came home and noticed that about
$600 worth of records and three
books were missing from his room
on James second. At the time, he
suspected that the theft had be,
curred in a one and a half hour
time span when his room was left
unlocked

ON THE tollowing Monday, his
three books were found lying in

someone's lawn, Finn thinks the

books. which were kept in the same
box as his records, were taken by

acCldent and later discarded when
the thief iound that they ivere
useless to him.

That evening Finn got another
surprise. When he returned home
he discovered a juvenile in his
room. attempting to steal his
receiver. He called the police, and
waited with the intruder until they
arrived.

THE police searched the
suspect, and found a key to Finn's
room. Finn’s roommate had
recently lost his key, but how the
would-be thief discovered which
room the key went to remains a
mystery,

Finn thinks BKVG un-
wittingly supplied that in
formation Once before Finn's
roommate had lost his key That
time the key was returnedewith a

little hejp from BStG, June
Bradley who found the key, called
up BEL/u and asked if they would
give her the name of the person to
whom the key belonged, so that she
could return it An hour later, Dale
Hawn. director oi the Physical
Plant, called up With the answer.
Finn feels the same thing could
have happened again,

A spokesperson for BKtG denies
this She says that the only people
to whom B&G will identify key
numbersare RA'S and members of
the Office of Student Affairs,

Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman says that when he
questioned Bee on the subject the
practice was also denied. He
nonetheless reprimanded the staff,
and they assured him it would not
happen in the luture.

BUT Jinl li‘inn Still does not have
his records back. Although he feels
that the person caught trying to
steal the receiver is the Same
person who took the records, there
is no proof of this He hoped that
the police would search the
suspect‘s room. but as or this date
that has not been done.

Grinnell police detective Jay
Stevenson explains .that he lacks
“probable cause" to obtain a
warrant to search the suspect's
room, But he ildds that the boy's
mother had searched the room and
found nothing.

ACCORDING to Don Schlld, the
county attorney. probable cause
consists of a reasonable belief that
not only had the suspect stolen the
records, but also that he had taken
them to this room

At this point, Finn Is not hopeful
or recovering his records, He is
sure that it the suspectdid steal the
records, by now they have long
Since been spread around

ASIDE from Finn many other
students have reported room thefts
this spring. According to the
Grinnell police, however, the
number is comparable to recent
years, The outlook for recovering
stolen goods is grim Students have
reported that unfamiliar faces
were seen roaming the halls on
days when the thefts occurred, but
that's about all there is to go on.

Although some thefts have
strange Circumstances, as the case
ofJim Finn's records. most are not
so complex Most could be averted
by locking a door.

CSL proposes changes

The Committee on Student Life,
at its last meeting of the year held
on April 27, turned down a proposal

for an SGArCSL conference
committee to iron out differences
between the two bodies.

The amendment, sponsored by
Greg Youtz and Jon Nciderbach.
grew out oi Joint Board
dissatisfaction over the way the
ESL handled several issues this
year, including most recently, the
boycott controversy. In that case,
when the Joint Boards and CSL
could not agree on a statement at
policy. President Turner opted for
the cm. recommendation

NEIDERBACH feels that the
conference committee would put
the power to decide back in the
hands of students.

But the CSL does not agree. “The
conference committee proposal,"
according to CSL member Marca
Fox, “would allow issues to die if
the committee could not agree on a
compromise." The amendment
specifies no action in case of a
deadlock in the committee,

SUPPORTERS of the amend-
ment, however, do not see this as a
problem. They contend that the
conference committee would

’ create strong expectations among

the student body tor a compromise,
thus forcing each side to give a
little.

According to Neiderbach. “the
problem was that this year‘s
student members are totally
unable to compromise. But what
the C51. does now really makes no
difference. Next year's SGA will be
able to appoint five out of the six
student members of the CSL. and
the Joint Board will be more
careful in questioning the can-
didates' political Vlews. .loint
Board will appoint only students
who will support SGA views,"

THE CSf. also moved to define
who exactly has the power to
remove CSL members. The
proposed amendment states, ”The
Committee itself retains the sole
power to remove any members or
the committee." Asserting the
sovereignty of CSL, Fox slates.
“We're not an SGA committee.
we're a collcge committee,"
During the boycott dispute, Joint
Board asserted that they had the
power to remove CSL student
members, although an attempt to
impeach four members failed. The
proposals now go to Joint Board for
consideration.

Boycott to determine Nestle status

vote on il referendum for the
boycotting oi Ncstlc's products

Service. The referendum is in
response to a nationwidc
movement to halt the alleged
unethical promotion of infant
formula in Third World countries.

The controversy centers around
the use of bottles and milk formula
for baby leeding, Although this is a
common practice in America, it is
a potentially dangerous and un~
feasible alternative to breast-
tcedihg in developing countries,
according to the Infant Formula
Action Coalition thFACTl. This
organiza on. working toward a
nationwide boycott, is locusihg on
Ncstle because they ”estimate that
Ncstle's share of world-wide Infant
formula market exceeds one-
third " INFACT purports that use

otherwise be breast-fed safely and
cheaply,

'l‘ffE group charges that Nestle
uses various forms of coercion to
induce mothers to use thElr
product. One rather blatant tactic
is carried out in the maternity
wards of hospitals which often
receive “substantial inducements

to one month‘s supply of the Nestle
lormula, Lactogen, is given to new
mothers, whose breasts Wlll then
stop producing milk. Alter the
mother has lost her free milk
source. she is hopelessly dependent
on the formula, whether she can
afford it or not. Even if breast
ieeding is still possible, “infants
may develop a preference for the
sweet formula” ‘or “the free-
iiowing bottle which requires less

work," and thus eat less while
breastfeeding and allow the
breasts to dry up lrom lack of
stillilllation.

iNr cT also attacks Nestle and
other inlant formula manufacr
turers tor their less obvious
promotion tactics used on poor
Third World women. While Nestle
estimates up to 70 per cent or the
women in these countries need or
choose to use formula, INFACT
feels “no more than to per cent of
Third World mothers»those who

need tor formula.” INFACT

charges that they are using

THEY argue that the ads
“suggest to mothers that their own
milk may be inadequate or in
