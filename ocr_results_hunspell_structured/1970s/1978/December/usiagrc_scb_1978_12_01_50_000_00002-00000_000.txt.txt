Battle of-the baths

by Ken Yortlon

The change in the School
bathroom policy, passed last night
by the Committee on Student Lite,
has caused conﬂict between SGA
President Greg Youtz and Dean of
Students Jim Tederman.

One part oi the proposal
stipulates that co-ed floors with
only one bathroom may not have
the option oi single-sex bathrooms,
The present policy states that the
vote of one person can bring about
a single-sex bathroom.

THE PROPOSAL was passed “in
spirit” at the November 16 meeting
of the CSL, and iinally passed
officially last night, In the interim,
Tederman sent a memo to the
other members of the CSL
protesting the proposed change,
and Youtz responded with a letter
of his own.

ViceProvost Ken Browning, who
represents the administration on
the committee, cast the sole
negative vote at the first meeting
and Youtz headed the student
iaction unanimously in iavor oi the
proposal, Faculty member Liahna
Babener abstained. The vote at
last night‘s meeting was 8-0-1 in
favor of the proposal.

IN HIS LETTER Tederman
contends that the changed policy
”may influence some ircshmen to
not come to Grinnell and iniiuence
some parents to not allow their
child to come to Grinnell.”

He argues that there may bc
some potential incoming ircsh-
men who, while wanting to live in u
Co-cd hall. would lint Want to use a
dial-asjohli system iwhieh allows
one to exclude the presence oi the
opposite sex only during the time
hesshe is using the bathroom). For
this reason. he concludes. they
might not come to Gi'iiincll,

heats

“P

\lim

Yout'l. and Tcderman: the great debate continues.

"FRESIIMEN are tra-
ditionally the most conservative
class in terms oi housing options,"
Tederman claims, “We will now
have to explain to ireshmen, and to
their parents, that there are 310
spaces <32 per cent oi our
housingl where they do not have
the choice at having a single sex
bathroom," He predicts that this
will cause large numbers oi freshs
men to choose floors where the
singlesscx option is available, it is
possible. he says, that “we will
have to place them in halls where
they cannot have the choice "

This prompted Youtz to reply to
the Committee members to Win
back those who may have becn
scared away tram the new
proposal by rederman's iears. Hc
termcd Tederman‘s claim that the
bathroom policy would keep
potential studc , lrom coming
here as "zlbsurd.'

sin-s \‘OL'TZ. “i
doubt whether any

sincerely
student's

decision to attend Grinnell would
be more than marginally (at most)
inﬂuenced by the fact that 32 per
cent oi our housing would require
that they use the same bathroom
that a member oi the opposite sex
uses , . . i am sure that they are
intelligentenough to recognize that
the dial-asjohn option will provide
them with exactly the same
amount oi privacy that the single-
sex option would."

He adds that although many
bathrooms which are single-sex in
theory become Cured in practice,
the present policy “inconveniences
a large number at students,”

should “start getting the [acts on
the table." Bruce Crane. a student
sound engineer tor the Scarleteers
and Tanagers, then detailed his
charges against the 1(ch brass.

Crane, a friend of Pollock's,
brought his charges to the com»
mittee because he is concerned
that much at KDIC's potential is
currently being wasted

Crane zeroed in on the condition
of KDIC’s east production studio in
Darby. He said that he felt An-
derson “stiﬂed for two and a half
months my eiiorts" to clean up the
studio. He pointed out that the
Studio Could potentially be an asset
to the Station, but was unusable in
its condition before he cleaned it
up.

HUDSON MILLER, the station's
production manager, disagreed
The studio, he said, was super
seded by a new news production
Studio which Anderson and Steve
Harp built in the summer. The east
studio. he said, is “almost totally
useless.”

Crane also played an edited tape
of a show that Steve Brull and
Anderson broadcasted in which
they did several things that Crane
felt were irresponsible. Examples
included shifting speeds during a
song, playing Smith Funeral
Home's General Announcemenm
(about Viho died today in Grinnell)
and ialsiiying logs.

BRULI. BRIEFLY responded
that logging mistakes at most
radio stations are “the rule, not the
exception " The matter was left for
the full committee to later resolve

The next meeting is set for next

disagrees. “It's only natural ior
personalities to play some part” in
the process, he believes, but adds,
”I do think that Grinnell College
tries Very hard to avoid this.” He
states that compared to other
schools at which he has Worked,
Grinnell does a good Job in the
difficult process of [acuity
retention. “I am impressed with
the integrity oi the dean and the
Executive Council,” he says

“They bend over backward" to
make sure the process IS a iair one,
he believes. “They suffer over
these decisions."

Leichtling, in the open space,
challenges members of the music
department to debate the matter
with him. Fudge is not taken with
the idea. “I have debated enough

continued discussion of
Iseichtling’s departure hinders the
department, and does not serve
any useiul purpose. “I would

talk about it any more. It's a dead

Leichtling insists that his case is
indicative oia widespread problem
that deserves to be discussed. “The
faculty retention issue is ab
solutely the most important issue
confronting the school because it
aiiects EVERY aspect of
education at Grinnell . . . I hope
that the issue will not be swept
under the rug again."
