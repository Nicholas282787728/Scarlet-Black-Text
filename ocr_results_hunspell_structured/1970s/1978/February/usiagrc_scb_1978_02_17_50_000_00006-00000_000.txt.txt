Blockbuster hits the,
screen this week

I)\‘ Nancy Curpentci-

\’.a are now celebrating Slavic
Weekend and the featured film is
Dr. lel\'il‘,f0.

Rapid calculation indicates there
are three possible ways to ap
proach this movie I.) The Block-
buster Approach: David Lean,
master of the spectacle turitlgo
User [he liiu‘r Rulii. Lawrence of
Al'nhinl. directed Boris Pasternak
uon the 1953 Nobel prize for the
original novel. Productlon costs
topped 11 million dollars. Over so
hours of film were edited to three
and a quarter hours. Robert Bolt,
famous for his A Mun for All
Seasons script, wrote the
screenplay Established stars,
including Omar Sharif, Julie
Christie, Rod Steiger, Alec
Guinness, Ralph Richardson,
Geraldine Chaplin, and Tom
Courtenay, play the leads. The
Russian Revolution and eternal
love are the topics. All those stars,
all that moneyethis I gotta see,

2.) The ”You Can’t Impress Me
With All Those Stars And All That
Money" Approach: If you’ve seen
one stunning snow-covered land
scape, you’ve seen them all, Three
and a quarter hours? Sounds
boring, Sure, I like Omar Sharif
but I understand that he Spends a
lot of time staring out oi windows,
staring at his desk, staring at the
sky, staring into darkness, etc. And
why are all the signs in Russian
while the characters speak English
in various accents? I don't like
pretentious movies. This I gotta
avoid.

Approach: It’s difficultto translate
ii great work of literature into film
successfully, Although I don't
expect a monumental work of art
in the mode of Pasternak's novel, I
do expect rewarding enr
tcrtainment. Dr. Zliivngo is a
thoroughly romantic love Story,
set against a backdrop of Russian
historyin little hokey, perhaps,
but worth the price of admission
free. If I see it, I’ll probably find
myself very absorbed in the lives
of the characters and sen»
timentally affected by the lush
photography

The other Slavic film, A Summer
to Remember. is a subtitled film
about a little boy in Russia. He
livns happily with his widowed
mother until she remarries. The
stepfather wins the boy’s af-
factions by buying him a bicycle
but the boy quickly demolishes it
by running it into a goat. (I am
quoting the publicity release.)
Although this plot summary isn’t
very enticing, the film received
[inc reviews. The little boy is
supposed to be an excellent actor
and Bosley Crowther called his
performance “a droll and delicious
thing ‘3

The Unsuspected. part of the
Film Noir series. was directed by
Michael Curtiz of Casablanca
fame, The story is a thriller about a
young woman living in a Victorian
mansion and being menaced by
Claude Rains. The emphasis is on
psychological manipulation as evil
people try to convince the sweet
young thing that she did bad things
at some point in her foggy past.

Proposal fails by one vote

provided for with the present
system.

Most of the major arguments
against Ute proposal were voiced
by Associate Professor of English
Peter Connelly, Connolly called the
proposed system “extreme" and
stated that it was, in his opinion
“not in the interest of those who
teach at the institution.”

THE new system, he claimed,
would “measure popularity”
rather than teaching effectiveness,
thus making popularity a
“criterion for promotion and
tenure."

By adopting the new evaluation
procedure, Connelly continued, the
administration would be “arguing
a lack of faith" in both the faculty
and in its own ability to hire and
develop competent faculty
members, And by asking every
student to fill out an evaluation
form in each of his classes. Con-
nelly emphasized, the ad-
ministration would he giving
“institutional inﬂuence" to the
belief among students that
evaluating faculty is “an im-

portant function of their being'

here."
CONNELLY concluded by

stating, “We don‘t need a more
accurate evaluation of faculty. We
need more encouragement and
development oi faculty. but this
form doesn’t do that."

Professor of History Don Smith
also questioned the legitimacy of
requiring students to respond to a
mandatory questionnaire, “It’s not
right or meritorious for us to force
students to respond,” he said

WHILE there was significant
faculty opinion expressed against
the new proposal, not all faculty
members were in favor of keeping
the present evaluation system, At
one point, it seemed as though the
faculty might vote out the present
system and reject the prcposed
one, thereby leaving the college
without a formal procedure in-
volving students in faculty
evaluations. Dean Walker
cautioned against such a move,
citing the almost certain student
protest that would follow.

A motion to abolish the present
evaluation system was never
proposed, however.

The SGA sent a letter to all
faculty members on Monday
voicing its concern over the
proposed abolition of the present
evaluation system. The SGA letter

urged the faculty to adopt the
Executive Council’s proposal (or
end-of—course evaluations and to
vote for retention of the current
system of studentsconducted in-
terviews.

FACULTY response to the SGA
proposal was unenthusiastic. Most
discounted it because of the great
amount of time needed to im-
plement both systems. Several
faculty members also voiced
concern over having an “over-
evaluated faculty."

Dean Walker said that he was
surprised and disappointed that
the faculty rejected the Council's
proposal. “I would have politicked
it more if I thought it would have
lost.” he said.

He said he still feels the present
system is inadequate. “The
Council‘s proposal was far 'and
away an improvement . . not
perfect, but an improvement,” he
said.

PRESIDENT Turner also ex-
pressed surprise and disap-
pointment with Monday's vote, He
said that he had heard “very little"
negative comment before Mon.
day's meeting,

He added, though, that
“anything of this sort has to go
through with the will and approval
of the faculty. If you’re going to
make a change,” he added, “it
better to lose by one vote than to
win by one.”
