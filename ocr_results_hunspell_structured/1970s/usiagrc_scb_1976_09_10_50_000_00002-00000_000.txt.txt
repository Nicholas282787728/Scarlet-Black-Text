The Scarlet and Black—September 10, I97t‘kpt 2

Enrollment increase

by Kathy Vuper

Several oldstimers, Le, “up-
perclassmen", have in these initial
days of classes commented on the
seemingly tremendous increase
of students According to John
Hopkins, newly appointed to the
position of Director of Admissions,
there has, in fact, been an increase
this Fall of only 29 students.
Hopkins speculated that the reason
why some classes are very run is
partly because advisers are
channeling new students into
similar course areas.

0i approximately II00 apr
plicants, 409 of those accepted
arrived on campus, including as
transfer students and 363 fresh-
men. Grinnell has more mid-
western students this year
(especially from Iowa) than in
recent years because, as Hopkins
stated. “The economic climate Is
more favorable for the Midwest

right now,” Arkansas, Delaware,
Nevada and New Hampshire are
among the least represented
slates

Regarding future admissions
policies Hopkins said. “We're
going to broadrbase our public and
try to present the college as
honestly and straightforwardly as
possible. We’re not out to ‘trick'
someone into coming here,”
Hopkins stressed Grinnell’s pre-
selectivity, that is, letting students
know beiore they apply where they
stand through test scores. high
school visits and high school
Counselors' advice, thus pres
determining which students can
iace the College’s demands

Additional recruiting ideas the
admissions office plans for
prospective students include
contacting parents tthrough
mailings), high school visits and a
campus workshop

time to start thinking about the
iollowing summer. especially it
you want to spend your summer
doing something related to your
future career plans.

First of all, you should carefully
and critically look at how you spent
the p t summer. What did you do?
What did you like about your job
and what didn't you like? It you
didn’t like your job, try to decide
what it was you didn't like and
want to avoid in future summers.

September is also a good time to

explore career areas that you may
not have considered. Christmas
and Spring breaks can be used to
intern, to volunteer, or it you are
lucky, to work in potential career
areas, This all entails planning,
research, and letter writing that
should be started now. The Career

Facelifteol Pub
to reopen tonight

by Mary Brandt
For the beerguzzling portion oi
the Grinnell College population the
two-week closing oi the Pub has
been cause ior serious gnashing oi
the teeth. Events leading to the
closing were truly part oi a time
honored tradition of the male
world, Late last semester the Pub
was the scene of a private bachelor
party, complete with a stripper
irom Marshalltown. Untortunately
for the Celebrants an observant
Grinnell police officer found the
Pub to be operating illegally and
unknowingly without the necessary
“Sunday opening” license.
During court proceedings this
summer the Pub Club corporation
was found guilty on these grounds
of a first offense and fined $50 plus
court Costs (the maximum fine is
$100 for a first Offense). To fulfill
the second portion of the law, Chief
Peters then filed a complaint with
the city council, asking that the
Pub's operating license be
suspended for iourteen days (the
maximum suspension for iirst
oiiendersl. it was apparently
Peter’s original intent to schedule
the suspension for the middle of the
academic semester. However,
after consultation with the Pub
Club board Peters requested that
the closing occur during the iirst
two weeks of the fall semester.
The possibility still exists that
the city or state could reiuse to
issue a new license when the Pub

applies for a renewal in the future
This is unlikely, according to Rick
biermnn. college attorney, since
the Pub is not considered a
problem by the police or towns-
people

However, the feeling was ex-
pressed by some members oi the
Pub board that Peters’s action in
closing the Pub was unduly liarsh
in lightoithe fact that it was a first
offense involving innocent
ignorance oi the local ordinance. it
was ielt that while Peters could
have been more severe if he had
adhered strictly to the letter of the
law, these members felt that the
intent of the law is considerably
looser for first offenders.

Happily, the Pub will reopen
September lo with an all-campus
party including happy hour prices
irom 7 pm. to 9 pm and tree
munchies. College ID’s will be
required. and memberships ($3.00
per year) will be sold at the door.

Cindy Smith, board chairperson,
outlined several major changes for
the Pub this year In addition to a
complete physical renovation
there will be a new sound system in
about three weeks. At that time the
bar will become “conversational",
with no jukebox music until to pm.
The Pub is a nonprofit
organization entirely student-
owned; any and all proiits are
circulated back into maintenance
and capital improvement,

 

Yearbook

debts and internal dissension,
would ordinarily be sufficient
warning for most students to stay
away trom the publication

In the past eleven years, the book
went unpublished three times, once
because oi the possibility oi libel,
twice due to lack of interest. One
editor resigned because he

resented SGA's inquiries into his -

administration, and at one time the
yearbook had acquired a total debt
of 53400

This year the publication came
as close to dying as possible, and
only through the eiiorts of two
students does it appear that there
is any chance at all that an edition
of this year's book will be
published,

Juniors Carin DePree and Van
Tsagaris stepped in last year after
the Student Government
Association's Student Publications
and Radio Committee recom-
mended that no funds be alloted
directly to the yearbook, This
decision was made because, at the
time, no one had Come to the
committee with a dcsirc to be
vearbook editor. lll addition. ac,
cording to SGA student coordinator
Matt Cohen. an SGA budget survey
indicated support for the yearbook.
but paradoxically, an uns
willingness on the part at students
to purchase a book.

“SGA was Concerned that the
yearbook required a substantial
investment oi money without
evidence that it was or could ever
he iinancially solvent, primarily
because or increased printing costs
and marginal student interest in
purchasing the book," he said,

DePree and Tsagaris disagree
with this analysis. They passed a
petition that expressed support {or
the yearbook at last year’s room
draw and collected 325 signatures.
DePree also feels thal, contrary to
SGA's statistics about student
interest in purchasing a yearbook,
Grinnell students are Willing to buy
a yearbook “Sales depend on
previous yearbooks, and since the
quality of the yearbook has lmr
proved, sales should go up," she
said

Lack oi meaningiul iinanciai
support irom SGA means that the
yearbook will have to be self-
suiiicient. To this end, Tsagaris
raised SLAZG over the Summer
from students, businessmen and
Grinnell alumni. Both DcPree and
Tsagaris anticipate that the money
raised from subscriptions and
advertising, as well as the
donations, could offset the printing
costs.

Whether this will happen
remains to be Seen. Tentative
plans have been made for a nine
bytwelve, 150 page book, but a
contract with a printer has not
been signed and cannot be con-
cluded until the Student
Publications and Radio Committee
permits DePree and Tsagaris to go
ahead. In iact, beyond raising the
money, the eiiorts oi the two
students are still in the embryonic
stages. Whether they can re
vitalize the yearbook, and over»
come the bizarre nature of its
recent past. is still very much an
open question,
