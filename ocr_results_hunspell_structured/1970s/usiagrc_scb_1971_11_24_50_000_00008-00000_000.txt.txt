Complex Heavily Frequentecl

Alter about two months at use, Mr.
Pfitsch is satislied with both the
operability and student use of the new
P.E. Building. However, several
building alterations have yet to he
made, and several items are not yet
installed.

Several other tinishlng touches
have yet to be put on the plant. For
example, the marking on the squash
courts is not yet completed. The
anchors on the tennis courts mustbe
improved. The goli storage area is
untinished, and covers oi the appara-

ever, noneottheseiinaltouchespre-
clude use oi the Complex. These
things have not yet been completed
partially because at budget difficulr
ties and partly because oi the heavy
E&G work load.

The vending machines cannot be
installed until during the semester
break because the final contracthas
not yet been signed. Until the college
has complete jurisdiction over the
building, the wateriineand electrical
lines for the vending machines
cannot be built. This is due to the
fact that until the college has lull
ownership oi the building, no basic
alterations can be made.

heaviest on the weekdays. However,
this tigure is only a rough indica-

while others may check out nothing.
The pool was also well used during
September and October. During the
122 guard hours in October, 1700
persons used the pool; during the
138 guard hours in September, 1236
persons used the pool. None of the
above figures include physical edu-
cation classes which would make
attendance tigures even higher

Mr, Piitsch also mentioned that
several community organizations
also make use oi the building. Be—

Between 100 and zoo Bot; and Start

in closing, Mr Plitsch noted that
although the Complex was well used,
its usage could be increased with»

The problem oi‘ the semester:
Where has the Grinnell Jag gone?
What with everyone talking about how
much work they have, thereis hardly
enough time to laugh anymore. Sure,
there is a general feeling of de»
pression on campus this semester,
but it's not all due to academic
pressure. Unfortunately, this pres-
sure bit has blown up so much that
a possible legitimate issue has be-
come a farce. With all these meet-
ings and everything, the problem
seems evident...students need a
CAUSE.

There is one simple effective way
to solve this CAUSE problem, and
with the administration’s help, we
can do it. Here’s the plan: Havethe
administration announce that they
are asking Chief Peters to conducta
search or all drug users on campus.
Naturally, this will rite the entire
student body, and will make {or an
exciting, stimulating three or (our
days of sit—ins, meetings and the
like. After the three or four days,
the administration can “bend to
student demands” and rescind the
new policy. Then everybody’s frus—
tratlon will be spent and we can all
get back to booking for finals, While

knowing that home, Christmas diu-
ner, and hours of TV watching is not
tar away.

But that’s not what 1 came to write
about. There’s no way the admini-
stratinn is going to carry through on
this plan, so we‘ll have to dump the
CAUSE idea and find anotheranswer
for the lack of humor problem on
Campus. And that's where the SM}
comes in. Remember last year, when
we had a JAG CONTEST??? Now
THOSE were the days! Well, the
8&3 is sponsoring ANOTHER JAG
CONTEST. Here‘s what you do to
win a good but yet unthought of
prize from your school paper:

It‘s easy. Just think of a harmless
and nonemalicious prank to play on
another person, your dorm, or-—-
yes!--even the entire school!!! You
can do this alone or in a group. All
we need is proof that your JAG is
not phony...pictures or witnesses
will do. Contest will be judged on
the basis at originality, good inten-
tionss~(which means being able to
make a lot oi'people happy)-»and how
funny we think your JAG is. Profs
