SO FTBALL

Despite generally poor weather
which limited intramural soithall
tor last week to a mere three oi the
12 contests scheduled, one verysigr
niticant upset was recorded,

Smith, which played in two oi the
three games not rained out or for-
feited, trampled a sorry Gates/
Langan squad 1578 on Thursday,
May 3, then knocked on heavily fav-
ored Off-Campus Friday atternoon.

In edging the undeieated otteCain-
pus people oes, Sniitii got lots oi
help lrom John Young, who contrir
huted several sensational catches
in shortecenteriield. winning pit-
cher Jen Dilnmit was aided also by
a collsistent all—around defensive
chart

The only othergame paired thewinr
less (except by forfeit) Gates/Lon»

gan nine and the 2- 3 Dilible/Cowles
eight. Alter tailing behind i o inthe
second inning, Dibble/Cowles ral-
lied m 21 tallies in the next two
at bats The tire was put out only

when Gates/Langan catcher Charlie ,

Erichford took over mound chores
to get the side in order in the litth
and linal inning

Grinnell sent a skeleton crew oi
thinclads to the Redmen Relays
at Simpson and paid for it by fin-
ishing lost in the team standings.
The individuals who did go perforr
med well, though,

Barry Huff won the shot and took
fifth in the discus and once again
looks like.I the favorite for the con,
ference title Chip l-iall annexed an-
other 3rd place javelin finish with
175 it. Dan Hildebrand and Da've
Raub placed one~two in the mile
run, although they were 10 seconds
apart, time-wise

The sprint medley team of Fall—
ace, Villareal, Morton and Eriles
iinished a strong third, as Jim
Eriles ran 2 03 7 in his first 550
oi the year.

But the highlight of the meet for

Sandbaggers

by Arturo Tapia .lr.

Last Friday the Grinnell sandbagr
gers took to the road again and Im-
velled to wtndy Galesburg, where
they played matches against Knox,
Carleton and Beloit. The Pioneers
played golf well, but were not fave
ored by Lady Luck as they beat
Carleton and Beloit, but lost to a
strong Knox team.

Individually, the Pioneers fared
well. Once again Long Hitter Trede
way paced the sandbaggers with a
strong 76. Controlled Hook Friend
also played well and came’in at 79

Grinnell came in the 2-mile relay.
In this event Grinnell's four intrEr
pid freshmen hallemilers, Dave Vil-
lareal, Ted Morgan, Mark Blanch»
ard, and Frank Morton all turned
in top performances to set a new
Grinnell freshman record of 5:14
(which got them 3rd place.)

The track team goes to Loras Sat-
urday as a final tune-up for the
Conference meet at St Olaf May

bably be satisfied with a duplica—
tion of Grinnell's fourth-place cr-

Par On Road

while Classic Push Tapia and beans
ly Touch Ellenson came in with 81
and 82, respectively, One Putt Sc-
hoene did not have a good day

The squad in general is still not
playing up to par. The sandbaggers,
it seems, can not put ittogeth‘ercon—
sistently. They have played excellent
goli at times, but have yet to repeat
their performances of earlier mate
ches. With the Conference meet
coming up, the sandbaggers only
hope that they can linally fulfilltheir
promises of winning the golf crown
which has eluded Grinnell for more
than eight years now.

Netmen In
Hard Times

by Dave Calvert
The Grinnell tennis team continued
its losing ways, losing three meets
last week. The first two were Mid-
west Conference foes. Carleton and
St, Olaf, at Northiield, Minnesota.
Last year‘s conference champion
squad, the Carls had little trims
tile whitewashlng a decimated (3 of
Grinnell’s top 4 players couldn’t
make the trip) Pioneer club on Frie
day. The next afternoon, this time
against the always tough Oles, Gri—
nnell fared no'better, losing 970.
Back home, and at full strength,
The Pioneer neimen faced another
tough toe, in Northern iowa. Northr
ern lowa, having a great season, eae
sily wiped out the home team. Brad
Vazales, Grinnell’s best player and
most consistent winner, was the only
Pioneer able to take even one set.
Although all hopes for a high lea-
gue finish are wiped out, prospects
fur matchib last year’s third place
finish seem bleak. The Squad'sCon—
ference record has dipped to 176,
while its overall record stands at
1-8. Today the team is at Beloit
for its last dui’il meet of the 1973
season Regardless of what goes
on there, the team will have a shot
at the top next week for the Con~
ference crown at the Conference
Meet, to he hosted by Carleton.

Baseball Pennant Hopes Dashed

by Marty lker

Two wins and ten losses might
not sound very impressive, but since
it is the season’s record for the
Grinnell Pioneer baseball squad, it
means quite 3 lot, This is the first
time in many years that a Grinnell
team has won more than one game,
if that, in a season. The most en-
couraging thing about it is that
only two players will be lost hee
cause of graduation, although they
happen to be two or the top play-
ers on the team: star pitcher Mike
Levy and outfield phenomenon Jeff
Dick,

Almost all the other starters will
be returning, however, but to go
anywhere, the team will still have
to come up with a couple oi pitch-

ers. Maybe next year's freshman
crop will be as fruitful as this
one was,

Grinnell finished off conference
action last Saturday when they drop—
ped 3 double-bill to C02 14) and
9-1, the first game going a total
at fifteen innings. Normally, dou-
blerheader contests run for seven
innings per game.

In the seasons finale Wednesday
against Graceland, the outcome was
no better. Graceland came out on
top by scores of llrf) and 11-3.
The first game against Cue was a
rematch between Mike Levy and Dan
Strellner, both of whom had pitched
in the conference opener won by
the Pioneers LO, Although Levy
pitched a great game and was backed
by some great deiensive maneuvers,
the team was not able to tnrnish any
offensive support. The only three
hits of the game for Grinnell were
collected by ireshman sluggerCraig
Zippe (two) and junior Bill Johnson.

i guess we’ll all just have to wait
until next year and then go atter
them again. Look out!
