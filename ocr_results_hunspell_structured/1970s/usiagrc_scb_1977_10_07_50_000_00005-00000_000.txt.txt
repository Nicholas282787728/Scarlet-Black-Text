Favored admissions policy benefits all

The recent submission of the
Justice Department brief in the
Allan Bakke case and the concerns
expressed in the “Open Space” of
two weeks ago by the Grinnell
black community give rise to this
column. The problems surrounding
the admission of blacks and whites
are of present and past concern to
me, for several reasons.

Firstly, as SGA president i felt
that the continued existence of a
strong black community was his
dispensible to Grinnell. (I also felt
that lowed my election to the CBS
and was loathe to see their num-
bers dwindle.) Secondly, I was
given the task of arguing the
Defunis case in .Prof. Wall’s
Constitutional History course, The
Defunis case was almost identical
to the Bakke case, but never
reached the Supreme Court. The
“jury" supported my side and
“struck” down the minority ad-
missions program at the university
in question. While I would like to
believe that eloquent and per
suasive argument on my part was
responsible for the Jury's decision,
I fear that the conclusion may have
been foregone on a jury made up of
white prelaw Students. Thirdly,

 

some years ago I was admitted to
an ancient New England prep
school as a token hillbilly, thus
benefitting from a “reverse
discrimination” admissions policy.
Lastly, I am soon to apply to law
school myself, and those ad»
missions policies are becoming of
every greater importance to me.

DBVIOUSLY there are com-
pelling moral and humanitarian
reasons for offering blacks the
opportunity to overcome the
handicaps imposed by centuries of
racism. I assume such widespread
agreement with the above
statement that I offer no
elaboration, However, I would like
to proffer a very seliish reason for
supporting the favored treatment
of blacks and other minorities in
admission processes.

By far the most important part of
my education here or elsewhere
has come from people as people,
not as professors or students. I
have learned an especially great
deal from blacks. I suspect that I
may be more sensitive to the
presence of blacks since I am from
the Southia part of the South that
has as many Nepalese as blacks
(none), I can clearly remember

 

the first black that I ever Saw, and
the first I ever knew Well went to
prep school and was from Pitts-
burgh.

MY KNOWLEDGE of blacks has
come almost entirely from those I
have known while in school outside
the South, 1 am very cognizant of
the benefits I have derived from
knowing andliving with blacks and
consider it an indispensible part of
my education. I feel that the
schools which I have attended have
had a responsibility to offer me the
opportunity of coming to know a
diverse group of people, and not
just a middle to upper class, My
white, protestant group. For a
school not to make special efforts
to admit black students, perhaps
thus denying me the chance to
know them, would be an
irresponsible injustice not only to
blacks, but to me. This alone
suffices to justify so called
“reverse discrimination.”

To shift the focus somewhat, I
would like to show just how
dramatically the Eakke case
points out the malevolent ab-
surdity oi current admissions
procedures and standards,
Colleges and universities have

Yes, there is hope for all of you
losers out there! Salvation is
nearer than you think; in fact, it’s
just around the corner at your
neighborhood bookstore. The
bumper crop oi self-help manuals
increases every year, and the
Grinnell College Bookstore (an»
ticipating the needs oi the
students) has collected . a , large
sample, No longer able to fit them
all into the psychology section,
they have graduated to a table of
their own, conveniently placed in
the center of the book section in the
back of the store. With continued
support and enthusiasm. they may
soon garner a section all their own!

The titles are attention-grabbing
and optimistic. Remember, they
say, you can never know too much
about yourself; Total
Self-knowledge is available in one
easy~to—read volume. The You That
Could Be screams on its COVer,
“Recapture the zest and con-
fidence you were born with!” A
praiseworthy venture, perhaps,
but a bit of a chance. imagine
reading the whole thing and finding
out that there‘s nothing to
recapture—you’ve been a schlepp
from birth.

OTHER TITLES are so well
sculptured to Grinnell life that they
seem to speak directly to people
you know. Am I 0.1m is one of the
most frequently asked questions in
Grinnell, though it is never ver-
balized. To ask is to suggest doubt

 

that you are indeed okriy, and if
there’s one unwritten law at
Grinnell which is never violated
(except perhaps in very select
company or in a drunken stupor),
it's the Self-Confidence
Requirement. Don’t worry, it
doesn’t have to be genuine; a blase
veneer is sufficient. And speaking
of unwritten laws, Playing the
Game the New Way would be of
interest to many students here.
Honestly, now, aren't we tired of
the same old rules? It’s about time
we came up with a lew fresh ideas,
and if there is a new way to play
the game, we don't want to he
behind the times. In fact, we could
invent a whole new game, and
really be a step ahead.

First impressions could interest
a few readers here The first-
impression phenomenon is in full
swmg at Grinnell, on both sides.
There are those who play at
making good first impressions
(some have a whole firstrtimer
we've met personality mapped
out), and those who are adept at
snap judgements.

ONE REASON for the first
impression game is conveniently
supplied by another self-help title:
If you Really Knew Me would You
Still Like Me? That’s a question
few people are brave enough to
want answeredewhy chance it". If
your first-impression personality
fits the ”Grinnell Cool,” \vhy put
anything else on the line? The

 

closest you can get to “knowing"
these first-impression people is
being able to recite their favorite
anecdotes backwards and for»
wards. Because they’re so afraid
you won’t like the “real person”
cowering inside of them. they don't
feel free to declare I Deserve Love,
which is the title of another book.
Anyone can deserve a one-night
stand, but love? “Why should
anyone love me?" they inwardly
cry, while they lean suavely on the
bar and cynically pick out their
next conquest,
That's where Loving Free comes in
handy. lt’s hardly surprising that
the cover of this one proclaims:
“More than 500,00 copies sold!"
After all, we need some kind of
justification, and if the book says
it’s all right . . . 4

Recent large—scale nuclear waste leakage
apparently covered up by news media

To the editor: An alarming news
report was carried on the WHO
early morning news of Monday,
September 25 A federal report
revealed that there has been a
largescale leakage of nuclcar
waste at a military nuclear plant 16
miles from Denver, CO]. The report
stated that 11.nuu acres of land
have been contaminated by this
leakage!

We may not want to think about
it, but incidents such as this one
are a threat to the health and
safety of all of us! Radioactive
wastes are among the most
dangerous cancerrcausing sub
stances known to man, and they
remain highly toxic for centuries.
There is no way that 11,000 acres of
land can be contaminated by

deadly nuclear waste without
causing health hazards to plants,
animals, and humans'

This recent leakage at the
Denver Nuclear Facility is not an
isolated incident. They have had
numerous problems there, and
reports of leakage from nuclear
plants have come from many parts
of the country, including leakage of
thousands of gallons of lethal waste
from the nation’s largest nuclear
graveyard, at Ilanford,
Washington, a few years ago.

It is shocking that there appears
to have been an chart to suppress
this deeply disturbing report on the
news media. We have listened
intently to the TV news casts since
Monday morning, and we have
searched every page of the Des

Moiiics Register for a report at this
ominous nuclear incident We have
seen and heard no mention of it.
Why was there not a iullowup
report on radio” Why was it not
reported on TV news7 And, why
was it not on the front page of the
Des Moinos chistorwr even
inside the paper?

it is of tremendous importance
that the peole be made aware of
nuclear hazards and the lack of
safeguards beiore it is too late.
Only then will citizens shed their
apathy and become concemed

enough to demand that nuclear’

production be halted until safety
standards are enforced. and until a

safe way is found to dispose of the ,

deadly nuclear waste. No safe
disposal method now existst Sigrid

it isn’t hard to turn out smart

this warped sense of values to an
ever increasing degree. If we do
away with admissions procedures
which can recognize the value of
such nonrquanitative attributes as
blackness, we will have suc-
cumbed completely to the sort of
madness best typified by such
standardized tests as the SAT and
the LSAT, The white elite of this
country which has made such a
thorough mess of education would
be ill-advised to restrict black
input at any level. It can only help.

Key Africa questions

By Russ Winick

Systematic exploitation and
oppression of non-white peoples in
southern Africa contributes
significantly to the financial
stability of Grinnell College, and
thus helps makes our “Grinnell
experience" possible.

American multi-national cor-
porations are by no means limiting
the pursuit of profits to just the
southern Africa section of the
globe, And their “business pr‘cdr
tices" (for instance, encouraging
singlecrop economies in Third
World countries and paying black
workers one third of a comparable
white employee's salary) have
long been facilitated by friendly
policies of the American govern
ment and covert schemes of the
intelligence community,

EVENTS iii Chile a few years
back reveal the lengths to which
business interests merge with

‘ intelligence and perhaps governs

mental strategies in an effort to
economic
and political climate. In South
Africa (Azania), American cor-
porations seized upon the already
“prospectful” situation created by
subjugation and apartheid, fur-
thering the exploitation to reap
sizeable returns on their inn
vestment dollars.

Some Grinnell students are
beginning to understand how our
political, business, and military
“interests" overseas combine to
upgrade the standard of living for
many Americans (bringing im»
mense fortunes to some) at the
direct expense of various people
worldwide Often, the more we
learn, the stronger grows our sense
oi powerlessness. The student
activism and radicalism of the late
50’s and early 70’s has largely
disappeared Many of us even feel
that a growth-oriented. capitalistic
economy. for all its evils, is still
“better" than any other “system,"

“REALITY” has pervaded our
orientation here on American
campuses today, and we speak of
change in incremental, not
systemic, terms. To dream
otherwise is to court frustration,
and most of us face more than
enough of that in simply trying to
be good, selfvconfident human
beings and in striving towards
some hopefully d5 able future.

S ill. 1 is depressmg to observe

'is not about

little about what transpires in
places like South Africa and who.
evidently, do not truly care Yes,
there is hope that progress towards
freedom and equality can be made
around the globe, But all too often
the paucity of aroused world public
opinion and real cconomic or
political pressure leaves the
strength of oppressors like the
South African government and
many American multi-national
corporations basically intact, This,
in turn, renders civil disobedience
and armcd violence on the part of
the down-trodden peoples the
seemingly best hope for
meaningful change.

ALTHOUGH strong arguments
can perhaps be presented that
exploitation is inherent and
inev1table in capitalism, America
to abandon its
capitalist system, The growth
mechanisms may of necessity be
slowed, but the profit motive will
persist. The question is, then, to
what extent can the governmental
laissez faire policies, CIA plots,
business operations, etc., which
are so abusive to large numbers of
our fellow humans, be curtailed
within the still»capitalist
framework of the future”

How strenuously will
academians and media specialists
work to stimulate interest and
disseminate knowledge of per-
vasive oppression and American
complicity in places like South
Africa? What sort of efforts will the
legislative and executive branches
of the federal government put forth
in attempts to regulate un-
scrupulous business activities of
the sort we have been witnessing
overseas, provide incentives for
more humanitarian practices, and
exert sustained economic and
political pressure to rid the globe of
oppressive regimes like Vorster's
in South Africa? To what extent
will corporate giants ever regulate
their oivn activities, with an eye
towards factors other than the
almighty dollar? And \\‘hat degree
of pressure will ordinary citizens.
through lobbying, interest groups,
public opinion and the ballot box.
exert on governmental, business,
and intelligence organizations to
eliminate their perilous tactics?

movement in the right direction

Rhodesian (Zimbabwean) chrome,
