Slump puts slight
damper on fine year-

by Tom Arenberg -

The women‘s volleyball team
picked a iunny way to end a suc-
cessiul season as it dropped all
four of its contests in the state
tournamentat Ames last Weekend,
The squad looked diiferent than the
one that rolled to a 12-4 record in
the first five weeks of the season,

Despite an easy draw in the
tournament, which Loras College
won. Grinnell did not have an easy
time. Against Briarcliit College,
Cornell College and St, Ambrose
College, Grinnell won the opening
game but lost the next two, Simp»
Son College. which the Pioneers
cloboered earlier In the year,
swept Grinnell. Sald coach Tom
Latimer about the disappointment,
“I hope it doesn't affect us next
year ”

Recent contests did not go well
lot the learn. The tournament
losses ran a losing streak to seven,
'3 string that almost matched an
earlier eight-game winning spurt.
Said Latimer about the laterseason
drops“, “I think we had a Change
of altitude, and I think that's my
fault.” The Coach added that he
probably dld not work the women
as hard as they wanted, Marilyn
Curran commented, “Volleyball is
a real psychological game. We
didn’t think we were going to win.
so we didn’t. We got into a rut.”

Overall this season, the women
combined a rewarding experience
with impressive scores. Despite its
inexperienced players and coach,
the team showed it could keep pace
with almost any opponent.
Overcoming occasional ins
consistency, the Pioneers ended
the regular season at 1277, giving
them 12 times as many wins as the
last two years combined. Serving
was a strong point all season.

The future is a little uncertain,
Latimer does not know it his
schedule will allow him to continue
coaching, although he hopes it will.
For various reasons, the team will
be without the play of Sarah
Bennett, Robin Connelly, Lisa
Hoppe, Jennifer Paarleherg and
possibly Curran, That will leave a
nucleus oi Gina Brandon, Kim
Brydon. Ann Chasson and Mary
Ann McBride next season.

Latimer has begun ellorts to
attract prospectives with
Volleyball experience. He also

Bowers, Martha Cassidy, Sandy
Gifford, Ann Harrison, Eva
Hierschbiel and Claudia Kee were
key members of the 4-2 JV and will
be counted on next year.

P1oneers m1ss playoff

Last Saturday, the Grinnell
tootball team traveled to Nor-

This year’s Grinnell team is’

made up of most or the people who
contributed to last year's 36-26
Pioneer Victory over Carleton, so it
was thought that Grinnell had a
good chance to defeat the Carls and
end the tour-game Pioneer losing
streak, It did not happen.

The game was not the iaultof the
Pioneer defense. The defense
played in an amazing 87 plays and
gave up only three touchdowns and
297 yards. Most of Carleton’s
scoring opportunities came about
because the Grinnell offense gave
up the ball deep in its own
territory.

After ten scoreless quarters, the
Pioneer offense tallied on two Paul

With Grinnell deep in its own
territory, Crane threw to Delaney
