"Language labs: College. 7
gets new audio-Visual lab 3'

by Jim Strickler

During the Christmas holidays,
the south end of the second floor of
Am! ceased to be a wing of
classrooms and was transformed
into a new audiovisual laboratory.
French Professor Victor Verrette,
who played a large role in
establishing the lab, said that the
center is open for use by the entire
campus community, Verrette feels
that the lab will be useful for all
departments, not just the language
department. Already the History,
Anthropology, and Music depart-
ments have used the new facilities.

The center is divided into two
main rooms, an audio Visual lab
and a listening room. Among other
gadgets, the Av room has a variety
of projectors, a video tape monitor,
light-tight windows. an overhead
audio system, and a desk~carphone
audio system. The room seats
approximately 55 people.

The listening room has 15 booths
with Wollensack tape recorders
and six passive (non-recording)
listening stations, Verrette coma
merited that the recorders provide
high quality sound and are more
energy efficient than recorders
previously used by Grinnell.

Verrette believes that one of the
best features of the new center is
that there will be an attendant on
duty most of the time to help people
use the facility. An attendant will
