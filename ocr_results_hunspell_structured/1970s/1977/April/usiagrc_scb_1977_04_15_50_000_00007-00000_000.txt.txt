The Grinnell woman's track
team opened their season last
Friday by overwhelming Cornell in
a 58-18 victory. Blasting winds and
delay in the starting time caused
by Cornell’s late arrival hindered
the women somewhat. But these
hindrances were not enough to stop
the Pioneers.

Grinnell’s women claimed first
place in every event, along with a
number of second and third places.

. he long jumpers began the

‘oring with Kim Krutilla placing
first. Sue I-Ienken placed third in
this event and jumped her personal
best. Shot putter Lucy Stone was

ﬁcpposed in her event and had a
fine showing.

Both the 440 yard relay (Mary J o
Ladu. Stephanie Nelson, Henken
and Krutilla). and the mile relay
team (Janice Tave, Chn's Stidlcy,
Henken and Krutilla), added filst
place points. Krutilla claimed two
individual first place in the 100 and
220 yard dashes,

Tave had a ﬁrst place finish in
the 440 yard dash and Anne Six
took first in the out) yard run to help
Grinnell accumulate more points.
An unusual event, the 440 yard
hurdles. was won by Steph Nelson
with Pat Muller placing second.

A high point in the meet came
when Christ Stidley won the two
mile event. In an oustanding
performance, she set a new school
record of 12:56.5. Earlier in the
meet Stidley had won the mile with
a very respectable 5:521 Also
placing in two mile race was
Adrienne Von Glatz, who finished
second.

Winning this meet boosted the
team‘s morale. This was the
usiest meet on the women’s
schedule and a nice way to begin
the season. Tomorrow the women
will travel to Des Moines to
compete in the Drake Invitational.
This meet is expected to be dif-
ficult and will give the women
more competitive experience.

Chess tourney held

by Geoff Wyatt

the Fifth Grinnell Open Chess
Tournament took place last
weekend in the Physical Education
Complex. It was an official United

tes Chess Federation event
a ich means that all players
receive a numerical rating based
upon their performance, and that it
was open to all U.S.C,F. members.
Wentyrthree playels competed
for the 375 first prize, all of them
from Iowa.

The tournament consisted of five
rounds, three being played
Saturday, and two more on Sun
day. Each player had 2 hours in
which to complete 45 mova, a
r asonably leisurely pace. As a

It there were many excellent
and exciting games. The chain»
pionship came down to a final
game between John Penquite of
r)es Moines, the winner of the last

'nnell Open, and Walter Morris
Jr., a student at Iowa State
University and the highest-rated

chess player in the state. Both
Morris and Penquite are classified
as National Experts by the
U.S.C.F.

Penquite, with the Black pieces
and four points, needed only a
draw to take first place, as Morris
had drawn one game previously.
Morris therefore attacked
aggressively while Penquite
patiently defended. After an in-
tense struggle, Morris was unable
to break through and the game was
drawn. Thus John Penquite
became the G innell Open
Champion once again, with a score
of 4‘/g-‘/z.

The tournament was sponsored
by the Grinnell College Chess Club,
and directed by Professor Arnold
Adelberg. No Grinnell students
participated—junior Steve Otis
scored two wins and suffered three
defeats, while senior Geoff Wyatt
finished with three wins against
two losses.

Rugby football

by Dave Ten Eyck

Wednesday afternoon the
Grinnell Rugby Football Team
took to Ward Field in pursuit of
its first victory of the young

son and came up on the long end
0 a 670 score. The first victims of
the season were a spirited and
agh group of ruggers from

c tral College of Pella, Iowa.

The Grinnell scores were
produced by coach Bob Oval on
penalty kicks, the first being of
considerable length and the second
coming from medium range. Other
highlights were dazzling runs by
Doug Cmelik and a couple of hard
hits from forwards Mark Blan-
chard, Howard McDonough, Dave
Ten Eyck and Andrew Devlin.
Doug Brower played a particularly

41h & Mam
Below Ross 8r Hesse

tough game at forward as well.

Last Saturday the ruggers
suffered a hard defeat at the hands
of UNI, 36—0. The Grinnell team
looked poor at best. They also
suffered the season loss of veteran
back Carney Loucks due to a
severe shoulder injury. The game
was roughly played and closely
contested, but Grinnell was easily
outdone by a veteran side.

The next two games of the
season are both home dates this
Saturday and Sunday. Upper Iowa
comes to play on Saturday, and
Sunday’s game is against the Iowa
State Cyclones. Both games should
be hotly contested. Starting time
will be 1:30 both days at the
Grinnell High School field.

golfers

by Bob Meyer

Last Friday the Grinnell “Best
Ball” Tournament, which
originally was scheduled to host
eight teams, hosted only four:
UNI, Knox, Central College and
William Penn. UNI won the
tourney, and finishing behind UNI
were Knox. Central, Grinnell, and
William Penn. Grinnell’s
respectable fourth place finish
occured without two of Grinnell‘s
better golfers, Mike Hopkins and
freshman Steve Moyer.

Last Monday Grinnell traveled
down to Galesburg, Illinois for
another five team tournament.
Monmouth won the tournament
and finishing behind Monmouth
were host Knox, Coe, Cornell, and
Grinnell. Coach Edd Bowers
believes that the absence of Moyer
and Hopkins had a direct influence
on Grinnell’s last place finish.

The sand, water and gusty winds
disturbed the Grinnell golfers.
Despite this fact, Dave Vanderpool
shot a phenomenal round of 3840,
78 which tied him with a Monmouth
golfer for medalist honors. Fresh-
man Phil Gutman showed poise as
he shot a respectable round of 86.

This Friday and Saturday,
Grinnell attends a two day tour-
nament hosted by UNI and Wart-
burg. Today the 15—20 teams play in
Cedar Falls and tomorrow
everyone plays at Wartburg’s
course located near Waverly,
Iowa. Only six golfers will
represent each school. This fact
imposes a slight problem on the
coach because of the limited
amount of time in which he has
been able to observe his players.

Coach Bowers has a vague idea
of who will play in this two day
tournament. He is sure that
Hopkins, Vanderpool and Gutman
will play. Dave I-Iarmon and Moyer
will be the likely candidates for
the fourth and fifth slots. The sixth
position will be open to Larry
Callison, Rich Fendler, David
Kohm, and Kevin Rackstraw,

Baseball started yesterday:

, Taylor invitational

by Tim DeCoster

Coaches fear such days. Com-
petitors dread them. Those days
when the entire turn has trouble
performing up to par. Not just one
or two guys having bad days, but
everyone on the squad. If such a
day occurs during your own in
vitational track meet, named in
honor of one who consistently
excelled at his event, it's a
disaster.

Last Saturday Grinnell hosted
the Morgan Taylor Invitational
and everything did go wrong. On a
windy, ul‘Lseasonably warm day,
all of the Pioneers, savea few, had
“offrdays.” Coach Mo Hunt was, of
course, “somewhat disappointed,
but not totally."

Hunt pointed out that most of the
other teams in the meet had
already been involved in meets this
season. “Our conditioning didn’t
get us,” he added, “it was our lack
of competition,”

The meet, named for a Gn'n»
uellian who Iongrjumped his way
into the Olympics, was won by
Luther for the third straight year

Tennis get

by Jim Stricklcr

The sun was shining, but that
was all that went well for the men’s
tennis team last weekend. They
had a rough time, losing to Ripon
(ll-1) on Friday, and to the
University of Northern Iowa (90),
and the University of Wisconsin at
La Crosse (9-0) on Saturday.

The Pioneers had hoped to
enhance their conference title
dreams by bumping off Ripon.
Coach Art Peterson said he was not
terribly disappointed with the
team’s loss, but he was disap
pointed because he felt that some
of the playels had not played as
well as they could. He said that the
limited amount of outdoor practice
may have hampered the team
somewhat.

Peterson singled out Dan Ed»
wards for his excellent comeback
against Ripon in the number one
singles match. Edwards lost the
first set, and was down 572 in the
second with two potential match
points against himfl-Ie came back
to win the second set 7»6, and the
third set 674.

In Saturday’s meets at Cedar
Falls. heavy winds compounded

as the Norsemen rolled up 118
points. Coe took second place (lot!)
and Grinnell was far behind,
finishing ninth (16 points) in a field
of 12 teams.

Tony Whitaker was one Grin-
nellian who performed well in the
meet as he placed, appropriately
enough, in the long jump. Hunt
labeled Whitaker's jump “one of
the few bright Spots in the meet.”

Despite the poor showing in their
l977 debut, Hunt can’t help but be ,
optimistic about his team. “Once
they get some competition behind
them," he commented, “most of
the guys will be performing as well
as they should, and we‘ll be much
better. Competition,“ Hunt em-
phasized, “is the key to our men
realizing their potentials and
performing as best as they're
able.”

Grinnell expects to surprise a
few teams with a better showing
than their opening performance as
the Pioneels travel to Pella on
Wednesday for the Central In-
vitational, hoping to rid them-
selves of a team-wide slump.

tough tennis teams. But despite the
lopsided defeats some players felt
encouraged by their per-
formances. Joe Topper said “On
the whole, I was relatively happy
with the way I played. I hit some
damn good shots, he just hit more.
I'm only unhappy because we
lost.”

Grinnell’s closest shot of the day
for a victory came in an unofficial
match between freshman Bennett
Bartlett and UNI’s number seven
singles player. Bartlett made me
trip to play the third doubles. He
split sets with me UNI player, and
had barely started the third when
the match was halted to allow the
number three doubles match to
start.

The tennis team travels to Cedar
Rapids on Friday to play Coe, and
to Iowa City on Saturday to play
the University of Iowa junior
varsity. Maybe they’ll come home
with more than sunburn this time.
