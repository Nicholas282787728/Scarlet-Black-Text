Swimmers, divers off to a fast start

By Bill Raynolds

The final results came down to
the last relay at both the Pioneer
Relays on Monday and the trirmeet
with William Jewell and Northwest
Missouri State on Tuesday,
William Jewell emerged victorious
on both occassions and yet through
a bizarre set of circumstances
Grinnell was awarded the trophy
at the Pioneer Relays.

The Pioneer Relays presented a
see-saw battle between Grinnell
and WJ. The former maintained a
tie behind the powerful swimming
of the 400 Medley Relay (Cocapt.
Bruce Jones, Greg Gomez, Greg
Olson. and Jeff Noble) and the 150
Freestyle Relay sprinters

(Stephan Weber, Bruce Pivar, and
Chris Corton). Then diver-
swimmer, Norm Zimmerman and
outstanding freshman diver Tom
Helpenstell gave Grinnell the lead
with a commanding performance
in the diving.

After some setbacks and ex-
cellentefforts by Koch, Gomez and
Olson in the 300 Breaststroke Relay
and another first place by the
divers in the a meter competition,
the outcome of the meet rested on
the final relay.

William Jewell and Grinnell
were vying for first place in the
meet, while Northwest Missouri
State and Drake were far behind in
the scoring. The 4130 relay team of

Jones, Corton, Weber, and Pivar
put up a fantastic race but was
bested by WJ. An exuberant
teammate of the victorious WJ
team leapt into the water prior to
the finish of the race. In doing 50,
he disqualified his relay team and
Grinnell was awarded ist place in
the Pioneer Relays with a score of
84 to Wills 74, NWMS’S 30 and
Drake’s 20.

The following day Grinnell
swimmers faced Northwest
Missouri State and a Vengeful
William Jewell team in dual
competition using high school
events. In spite of a victorious
surprise appearance by Bert
Simpson in the loo Butterﬂy and

strong efforts by the entire
Grinnell squad, even mono-
stricken cD—capt. Frank Halley’s
stop watch could not deny that W!
had emerged the victor. With only
three weeks of practice, Grinnell
was unable to overcome the ex-
tensive conditioning of the
scholarship supported WJ team.
Once again the score was
deadlocked prior to the final relay
and once again Grinnell was
touched out, but this time none of
the Jewel] swimmers decided to
take a celebration plunge.

The Grinnell swimmels' next
challenge sends them against
powerful Rockford College on Dec.
10 tor a dual competition.

trailing by two points at the hall,
but the team's depth and skill
helped them pull out a Victory.

Sarah Brichford, a freshman,
played an outstanding game. She
sank seven shots to make her high
scorer on the team with fourteen
points. Sophomores Marnie Curran
and concaptain Kim Krutilla also
made contributions to the scoring
game

The game was consistently close
with no more than a six-point
difference on the scoreboard at any
time. With a few minutes left in the
fourth quarter, two Pioneer
starters, freshman Gretchen
Trekell and sophomore co-captaln
Renee Reese fouled out, Winkler

said she was glad to have enough
depth on the team to replace the
pair.

Winkler played a total of eight
players, She said she was ex
tremely proud of them all.

“They played aggressively yet
maintained their cool and noise,
which was one of Coe’s downfalls."

Th( Nin was well deserved by the
team and especially by the
sophomores who survived last
year‘s \viniess season.

Last year’s captain. sophomore
Stephanie Nelson, sidelined due to
an injury, commented on the
game, “I was really happy to see
us win and I know l'll have to work
hard to keep up with our iast-paced

Grinnell fans were also pleased
with the win, Spirit and adrenalin
nowed throughout the entire game.

Winkler stated. “It was good to
see such a promising turnout and
support from the campus com
munity."

The Pioneers will be polishing up
their game by concentrating on
treethrows. They made only three
out of 23 lree throws in Saturday
night’s game

Coming off this win, the team
will try to maintain its momentum
against host Marycrest Junior
College this Saturday night.

Volleyball

By Dave Blough

The Men’s Volleyball Club opens
its preseason this Saturday when it
travels to Cedar Falls to play in the
Black Hawk Invitational Tour-
nament. Regular season play
begins next semester when
competition in Grinnell’s con-
ference, NCIVA, gets underway.
Other teams in the conference
include Graceland. which is a
perennial power, Minnesota,
Western Illinois, Iowa State, and
others.

Along with mtraconference play,
the club will be competing in
several U.S. Volleyball Association
tournaments. There will also be
two tournaments held here at
Gnnnell next semester. One will be
a conference tournament and the
other will be the Grinnell Ina
vitational, a USVBA tournament.
Both of these tournaments will
feature good, competitive
volleyball, which is one of the most
exciting spectator sports around.

Hopes for this season are high
among the club members. Coach
Tom Latimer is relying on a solid
core of returning players along
with some added depth from the
new members ,of the club. After
last year’s initial trial season, the
outlook for men’s volleyball is a
bright one, with a good deal of
thanks going to the campus
community for help in overcoming
the club’s budgetary problems.
