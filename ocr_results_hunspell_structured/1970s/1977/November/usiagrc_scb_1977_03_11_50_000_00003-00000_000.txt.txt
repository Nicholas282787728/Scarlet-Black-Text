g Candidates address issues

Two candidates, Tom Asch, a
sophomore, and Linda Cornelius, a
“tj'unior, are campaigning for next
year’s SGA vice presidency, The
election will be held Monday.

Meet-therCandidate study
breaks will be held Sunday night at
8:30 in Younker Lounge and at 10 in
Loose Lounge.

The 5&8 asked both candidates
to respond to the same questions in
writing Following are their
responses.

When are your qualifications ior
vice-president? s
'cli: I am a member of the Joint
“Board. and I was an active
member of SGA earlier this year. I
am iamiliar with the power
sii-ucture or the Jomt Board and
:eommittees. These qualifications.
however, are secondary. My main
qualifications stem lrom the
realizations I’ve had about SGA.
SGA has been mocked through
\vi'iterin campaigns, and the
largest single voting block at this
school is the non~voters Many til
not most) students think that SGA
is a joke. My recognition of this,
and my willingness to work to
change the situation are my
qualilications.
Coriielii . Since I've been at
Grinneli, l have been involved with
guy aspects of student govern
' went, and i believe that my

familiarity with the power

Linda Cornelius

structure will allow me to work
effectively for student's interests
Last year l served on the Student
Services Committee, the Coun-
seling Committee, the Student
Advisor Selection Committee and
the Grinnell Relays Committee. I
was Chairperson of the Food and
Facilities Committee and I at
ed nearly all of the Joint
Board‘s meetings.
Th's year I am on the SoClal
ies and Regulations Com»
mittee, the Political Science EPC,
the Curriculum Council, the Health
Services Committee and the
Campus Judicial Council. I have
attended most of the Joint Board’s
meetings this year.
What is (arc) the most pressing
problems) lacing Griiinell no“?
Ase . The most pressmg problems
facing Gi'innell are SGA's lack of
credibility, and the lack of ef-
fective student input into the side
ministration and into SGA itself.
h of the problems on this
( us can be traced to one or
both of these two problems For
example, our problem with al-
firmative action will be our need to
guarantee enforcement through
o’studcnt government The
question of alcoholic parties is a
matter or inadequate student input
into SGA SGA never came to grips
with the real question: What do the
students want? It the hall reps
simply called a short hall meeting
and polled their constituents. then
we could proceed to make an ins
telhgent decision based on student
wants, not personal preference

Corneliuv First many of the

 

problems over the past year have
stemmed from Inflation and
budget cutbacks. The ad
ministration has been trying to cut
its own costs, which means that
things which are important to
students. such as the Health
Center, the Black Studies
program, the plans to carpet
Burling, and the jobs filled by
Georgia Dentel and Kathy MC-
Cluskeyi are being reduced It is
important that the SGA work with
the administration when budget

' cuts have to be made, in order to

insure that cuts are made in areas
where they will least afleet the
quality oi life for the students.
Second, there are nonsbudgetary
problems, such as the need for a
lnore aggressive affirmative
action plan to bring blacks and
women into the permanent faculty,
the need to attract more black
students. and the need to work out
a concrete agreement with raculty
and administration for the
solicitation ol'student ideas prior to
the time when important decisions
are made.
What can SGA till about the
problems you mentioned above?
.‘\sch: SGA has to stop Just talking
about student input and start to do
something about it. The student
input committee has met two times
with the administration, This
committee was formed the Iirst
half of last semester. Jomt Board
has a habit oi thinking something
has been accomplished simply
because a committee has been
formed. SGA should break this
habit.‘
Cornelius: SGA can, and must,
work for more student input into all
decisions which are made on this
campus. The vicepresident has
traditionally worked Closely with
the EPC’S and the Curriculum
Council and'l would work to in»
crease student input in the
curriculum and personnel
decisions made by EPcs. The
proposal to streamline the com-
mittee system which I have
worked on in sun: this year,
should make it easier for students
to communicate with the ad-
ministration next year.
WllLIt ideas do you have for SGA
iicxt ycnr?
nscii: The following is a general
outline of what i intend to propose
to SGA ii elected, SGA should:
1. Create an administrative liaison
committee that will meet with the
administration to determine
“what’s cooking” ads
ministratively. Any decision
thought to affect student life
significantly andor adversely
would be reported to Joint Boards.
2. Appoint one or two students ex-
officio members of the board of
trustees. This exists at other

 

schools and the alumni send a
representative to sit in on the
meetings. it doesn’t seem
unreasonable for the studenB to
know about plans for the future 01
the school.

3 Request special interest groups.
such as CBS. the Women's Group,
and the Gay Community to elect
representatives to Joint Board as
non-voting members. The interest
groups members are scattered
throughout the campus; thus. they
have little influence in choosing
hall reps Sending a member, who
can present proposals and bring
problems to Joint Boards at-
tention, would give a group greater
InpuL

‘ Tom Ascli

~i Amend the constitution so that
hail reps must be re-elected at the
end of the iirst semester. A
primary requirement for a
responsive SGA is that hall
representatives’are' responsible 'to
their constituents. The way SGA is
set up now, there is nothing to
encourage the hall rep to be
responsible.

a, increase freshman participation

'in SGA. Freshmen are a quarter of

the school. yet they have virtually
no representation

Cornelius: I would like to see SGA
continue many of its current
programs, including the programs
handled by the Student Coor-
dinator's Olfice. and the efforts to
get a definite affirmative action
policy at Grinneli,

In addition. I would like for SGA
to work actively to find out what
projects and programs students
are interested in and then to
evaluate and implement these. in
the past year, SGA has spent much
of its time and energy reacting to
the administration, I hope that
next year SGA will have enough
time to work positively towards
student-originated goals.

City to beautify
downtown area

liy Dave \l‘ick

The town of Grinnell is about to
undergo an extensive
beautil‘ ation program, Ap-
proximately one year ago, in a
regular meeting oi the Grinneli
Chamber of Commerce, all
members prescntwere askcd to Jot
down three programs that they
would most like to see put into
action. The program cited most
oltcn was one of improving the
appearance of Grinneli, Thus, a
Beautiiy Grinneli Committee was
lormed under the leadership of Al
Eisenman, President of Grinneli
Federal Savings and Loan.

The initial step taken by the 12
member committee was to Con-
tract lnter-Dcsign, lnc.. a con
sultant firm based in lowa city.
Jlm Maynard. landscape architect
for the firm. has already presented
an inventory of community ap-
Dearance and evaluation to the
committee in two separate report
meetings, Thcsc reports consisted
oi slides showing the major areas
of concern ‘ together with
Maynard’s commentary on each.
One more such meeting is planned

To be improved iirst are the four
major entrances to Grinneli ex
tending lrom the city limits to the
intersection of Routes 6 and 146.
The committee hopes to commence
the beautification this May with
the planting of trees and shrubs
and. as chairman Eisennian put‘lt,’
"cleaning‘up the crap" that has
been lcit in open areas The
committee is presently loo ing for
volunteers willing to do this work.
Eisenman said that the committee
uill gladly welcome the assistance
oi any college groups. ‘ y '

Long range plans include imr
provements within the central core
of the downtown area and the
commercial and industrial areas
with similar plantings and perhaps
the addition of small ”pocket
parks" in available spaces, Alsoin

 

the picture is the possible return
bishing of building facades and a
traffic and parking study.

Cost [or the total project cannot
be precisely {determined until all
aspects of the programs are
carried out, The committee,
however, is trying to accumulate a
maximum Sum of $15,000 for "is
ventory. evaluation, and plans
through both private and public
contributions These contributions
are expcctcd to cover the cost
completely

Never has iliere been a sprucing
up program this extensive in the
history of Grinneli although one
unsuccessful attempt was made to
improve the architectural ap-
pearance of thc public buildings.
Eisenman is very optimistic about
the success of the prOJeet and leels
that some improvemcnts will
occur even it they are not those
originally desired.

"Something will get all the
ground, I'm not the type of person
to see money put out and nothing
done." declared Eisenman.
"However, this is ii long range
program that won‘t happen
overnight. The ideas will take time
to sell and the plantings will take
time to grow.”
