Daily waste unnoticed, taxes resources

The hot issues of Kent State,
South Africa and Affirmative
Action are undoubtedly cooking on
the front burners oi campuses
around the country at present, if
only perhaps because someone
keeps the heat turned up under
them.

It would be wise, however, not to
forget those problems which are
simmering on the back burners at
the moment. These are issues
easily as important. if not more
important that the current ones,
but few people seem to be getting
particularly roused about them.
Perhaps this is true because the
issues do not directly affect human
rights. But things which simmer
often tend to boil over when they
are left unattended.

SUCH simmering issues—
energy and resource conservation
for onkare also matters with
which students, as citizens of a
country and of the world, are
inextricably involved whether they
like it or not. In fact, it has become
increasingly clear to me that our
simple day to day activities, which
we are often unaware of or take for
granted, have substantial impact
on such problems as energy, food
and resource conservation. The
amount of food we eat or throw
away, or the amount of water we
pollute or use are small but by no
means insignificant factors in the
total national or world con—
sumption of resources.

Jumping from the general to the
particular, let us consider some
seemingly innocent activities such
as eating and washing and the
ways in which we may be un-
consciously causing considerable
waste.

ACCORDING to Dave MC,
connell, Food Service Director,
one rather common eating practice
of students on board is to leave one
or two tablespoons of salad

dressing in the bottom of the salad
bowlisomething few people think
about, which is exactly the
problem.

if we assume purely for
examples sake that one night all
980 board students decide to eat
dinner, and each student has one
salad and wastes one tablespoon of
dressing, that adds up to 7%
gallons of dressing down the drain,
for just one meal. In dollars and
cents that is $43.13. Over 218 ser»
ving days, that would at the same
rate, accumulate to a potential
waste of about 1,635 gallons or over
$9,000. That 39,000 is the equivalent
of 12 full board plans.

OBVIOUSLY. this example is an
exaggeration, but it also considers
only one single item of the menu. it
only ten per cent of the projected
amount were real waste, that
would still be $900 or one full board
plan. And we have considered only
the evening meal, or 50 per cent of
any comprehensive projection.

A more careful study of student
Waste was conducted in the spring
of 1975 at the University of New
Hampshire‘s Durham campus, in
conjunction with the Ritzman
Nutrition Laboratory. According to
an article in the journal of the
National Association of College
and University Food Services, the
results of the study were
“somewhat distressing.”

IT WAS FOUND, after Scientiﬁc
collection and analysis of food
waste during a two»week period in
one of the dining halls serving 36
per cent of students on meal plan,
that although kitchen waste was
only .2 per cent of that prepared,
plate waste was 14 per cent of the
amount actually served.

In other words, each student was
throwing 11 grams of edible
protein per day into the trash can.

 

Calculations Showed that an
average of 87.5 grams of protein

SGA should stick
to the local issues

A couple of weeks ago, someone
asked the SGA president, on a
KDIC talk show, why the SGA had
been spending so much time
dealing with abstract issues in
stead of concrete issues. Namely,
why had the majority of the Joint
Boards’ time been spent discussing
South Africa and Kent State. issues
which do not affect the everyday
lives of Grinnell students. To this,
the SGA president replied that he
had been elected on a platform
consisting of those issues, so he
was going to stick to them.

1 had a queasy feeling in my
stomach as I remembered a letter
I had Written to the 5&3 last year
as a contribution to the Open Space
column. In it l had outlined how I

thought the SGA elections worked' ‘

“STUDENT government elec»
tiuns at Grinnell have not been
known to center around specific
issues. Student officers are elec-
ted, in some cases, by students who
feel that a candidate is capable of
handling the problems which Could
face the student population in the
following school year. Therefore, it
is not a specilic ideology which is
supported, but a faith that given
the power, the candidate will act in
the best interest of the student
population,

“In other cases, students will
vote for a candidate not because
they feel the candidate will
represent me student body, but
because if elected, the candidate
will appoint them to a' student
government position. This is not to
say whether a “spoils system" is

 

right or wrong. It is stating a fact
that some students want to be
rewarded for their efforts, and
they are not voting for a specific
ideology.

“MY ‘FINAL example is the
large group of students whovote for
a candidate because he or she is a
nice pelson. Popularity should not
be criticized, but again, the
ideology of how the student
government should be run has little
effect on the person’s decision.”
I ended the letter on this note;
“If you do feel the obligation, vote,
but investigate. and make damn
sure the person you vote for will be
acting in YOUR best interest.”

FOR ONE reason or another the
letter never got printed, but it’s
funny how things like that come
back to haunt you. There‘s no
reason for me to believe that this
year's SGA president was elected
any differently than his prede
cessors. That brings me back to the
queasy feeling in my stomach
because Jon Neiderbach obviously
believes he was elected on his
platform, or why else would he act
as he does?

SGA presidents, acting on their
own personal interests in the name
of the entire student body, are
nothing new. in fact, when seeing
how few people actually vote, and
the reasons why they do, you can’t
blame the presidents for it. We
more or less give them permission
to do so. The problem we've en
countered this year is that we‘ve
got an SGA president Whose inc

were served daily per person,
which means that the waste could
have fed an additional 145 people!

Moreover. the initial level of
protein intake—87.5 grams—was
considerably higher than the
recommended dietary allowances
(46 grams and 56 grams for adult
women and men, respectively)
suggested by the National

’Research Council. Based on the

FDA for protein, the same waste
could have fed over 220 adult men
or women.

McConnell estimates that the
average Grinnell student can-
sumes about 100 to 120 grams of
protein per day. while the national
average is 72 to 90 grams per day.

IN ORDER to increase student
awareness about nutrition and
diet, which includes inefficient
eating, McConnell hopes to have a
mini—course planned by second
semester which would last for
about three weeks. He also hopes to
eventually conduct a careful study
of waste at Grinnell.

All of this is not to suggest that
what the students do not eat should
be given to “the starving Children
in Asia." Such diplomacy would

 

probably not be appreciated.
Rather, l‘m merely attempting to
point up an everyday example of
inefficient usage of resources—life

sustaining resources.
AFTER EATING, must of us

probably go wash our hands or
perhaps brush our teeth or maybe
even Wash our face. Now, ac»
cording to an article in the news
magazine of the Union for Radical
Political Economics, if you leave
the water running while brushing
your teeth, you probably “use”
seven to ten gallons of water per
day. If you turn the water off while
you gaze at yourself in the mirror
or contemplate the sink bowl, you
would only be using half a gallon or
155 of water per day‘.

Similarly, by leaving the water
running while taking a shower, the
average pelson would “use" five to
ten gallons per minute, or during a
tenrminute Shower, a total of 50 to
100 gal. By turning the water off
while soaping and scrubbing, one
would use 2.5 to 5 gallons per
minute. During a ten-minute
shower, that’s 25 to 50 gallons. in

Opening draws blanks, celebs

On Thursday evening, October a,

Inadvertently, Bill Kowalskl.
dressed as an armadillo, slipped on
a moth ball and crumpled his
snickerdoodle. Consequently, his
coverage of this event bears no
resemblence whatsoever to Ac-
ton‘s outstanding ability.
Therefore. with all due respect to
Kowalski's unique journalistic
style. we encourage students to
visit the Acton exhibit in the
Negative Space Gallery through
October 22nd in order to get their
own impression of the show.

The opening of Sven Oben-
doben’s exhibit of pencil Sketches
and pen and ink drawings at the
Metropolitan in Aak, Ohio, last
Thursday has left me both excited
and bored, The message of the
show (as best emphasized through
the title “Endless Farina”) seems.
to an expert critic such as l. to be
one of excitement and yet
boredom. The general consensus of
the highly intellectual clique of
which I am a member was that the
exhibit was the most exciting and
yet the most boring oi Sven's
career. Everyone also agreed that
Sven’s social commentary in this
exhibit was much more bland and
beige than those in his past.

For example, back in the
glorious past (issarishl, Sven was
stunning the art world with
exhibits such as his moderately
famous ”Cranberry Bears,” a
Social comment on the Vietnam
War. It was the ﬁrst of many
exhibitions to use men in flaming
leisure suits to put across any type
of poetic mood.

THEN AGAIN in 1967, Sven and
his compadres (working in a
commune that eventually made a
substantial change in his views on
morality and the price of cheese
spread) played games with artistic
conventions with their has-reliefs
of old women drinking milk out of
dribble-glasses.

Obendoben has been creatively
barren Since 1963 when the death of
a gerbil named Ralph nearly
pushed him off the deep end. But
here it is 1977. What seems like a
millenium since the blcentennial
and all of its tacky realism, and
Sven Obendoben has finally put
together another showing. As a

“come-back,” this exhibit leaves.

50 per cent reduction in water
heating and softening costs per
person, notto mention the savings

IN A SNOW»covered midwestem
state in the middle of winter, such
waste may not seem very
significant or critical, but in the
peak of a summer drought it
certainly would be.

I’ve tossed around a lot of
figures. and I hope the preceding
examples speak largely for
themselves. There are many
seemingly minor things we do in
our daily activities which
ultimately may have a large im-
pact on the environment. Altering
daily habitsialten'ng our con-
sciousness-however, is usually
more difficult than organizing
demonstrations or passing
legislation. But it is a change in
which each individual can par-
ticipate as soon as he or she
decides to do so. Unless we change
our way of thinking about our
relationship to our environment, no

 

necessary change in that
relationship will be complete, if
even begun.

These are several of the works done by Ra Acton which are now
showing in the Negative Space Gallery at the Forum.

much to be desired. Although
certain pieces seem important,
none are worth mentioning.
HOWEVER, the wall-to-wall
crowd that assembled was abr
solutely astounding. Of course
spot-light hounds DORIS DAY and
POPE PAUL VI attended, And
speaking of the religious crowd,
BERT and ERNIE of Sesame
Street fame were supposedly
there, though i never saw them.

The biggest surprise of the entire'

affair was the impromptu session
of card tricks performed by THE
AMAZING KRESKIN, who sud-
denly appeared out of thin air.
ANDY WARHOL, whose name is
by now synonomous with art in
Aak. was nowhere to be seen.

ETHEL MERMAN was, however,
and no one even seemed to mind.
KATE SMITH made an ap-
pearance, and for a minute it
looked like the two heavyweights
would have a go at it. (Merman
rolled the sleeves other Dior gown
up past the elbows, while Smith
clenched and unclenched her
massive fists) but the altercation
was avoided when each received a
side of beef.

All in all, the exhibit was
impressive and yet not. The fact
that so many patrons would gather
for an exhibit given by a man who
is still in a strait~jacket never
ceases to amaze me. And yet it
does.
