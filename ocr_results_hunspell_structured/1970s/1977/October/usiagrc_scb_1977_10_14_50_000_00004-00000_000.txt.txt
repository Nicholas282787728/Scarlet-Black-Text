Statement amended

Joint Boards ratified Wednesday
night an amended version of a
statement concerning divestiture
of college stock in companies that

violate United Nations economic‘

sanctions against South Africa and
approved an appropriation for the
James Gang Bang.

The statement was passed after
considerable debate by a margin of
13-7-2.

The amendment to the
statement, introduced by Gregg

Edwards, calls on SGA to strongly ‘

urge all segments of the Grinnell
community to initiate a letter
writing campaign ”directed at the
members of the Congress, the
President, the United States
Ambassador to the United Nations
and the executives of American
companies violating United
Nations economic sanctions
against South Africa.” These
letters would voice “their op-

position to the practice of apar-
theid and the continuation of white
minority rule in South Africa."

The statement on divestiture had
originally been proposed at the
September 28 meeting as a part of
a larger statement on the problem
of South African investments. At
that time, the passage of the
divestiture statement was tabled
on a motion by Rich Caplan.

The divestiture statement calls
on the college to ”sell its stock in
all companies in which the college
stockholder‘s resolutions are not
approved and that continue to
violate the United Nations
economic sanctions against South
Africa," Such an action, the
statement says, should occur after
a year and a half or two years.

SGA President Jon Neiderbach
was pleased that the statement
was ratified.

“I’m happy that it was passed. 1

w1sh it was by a larger margin. 1
think that now the next step is to
effectively inform the campus
community regarding the issue
involving college ownership of
stocks of corporations that do
business in South Africa, and make
sure that the Trustees feel that the
college community is strongly
interested in the matter."

In addition to passing the
amended statement, SGA also
ratified a $460 allocation for the
James Gang Bang, It also ap-
proved a new system for supplying
hard liquor at the event. Those
students wishing to drink hard
liquor at the Gang Bang must now
purchase in advance one ticket for
every drink. These tickets, which
will’cost 25 cents. will be sold at me
forum desk sometime next week.
Beer and soft drinks will still be
provided at no cost, and admission
to the event will still be free.

Brown presents liberation theology

(Continued irom p. lt

Specifically, he
assisted students with drafts
resistance by proposing the best
plan to follow for each individual
rather than enforcing a blanket
policy. It is appropriate, therefore,
that Brown addressed the
relevance of liberation theology for
the Gates lectures. His central
thrust was that the US. must
realize that it cannot continue to
oppress the Third World without
bringing dﬁtruction.

IN HIS presentation, Brown
declared that liberation theology
encompasses five main
operational aims. First. people
must recognize the poor, he said,
explaining that too often the af-
fluent ragard them as marginal
people . This is the starting block if
people are to consider themselves
members of the JudeosChristian
community. Examining the
scriptures reveals that God is
identified with the Door. he said.

Brown pursued this argument by
citing several other theologians.
One scholar he mentioned stated
that the strugglingindigent see the
world most realistically whereas
the opulent attempt to obscure
objectivity. Another source, from
Peru, remarked that poverty is not
accidental and must be contested

by political action, not charity.
Brown added that charities too
often patch up, but do not solve
problems.

THE SECOND emphasis of
liberation theology relies on the
poor to raise some integral
questions. Among these is asking
What kind of religion can justify the
present world situation. This
should help evoke response from
the oppressors,

Such a reverberation on the part
of oppressors leads to a third goal,
which concerns class conflict.
People need to put emphasis on the
reality of that conﬂict, Brown said.
People are being deprived and they
harbor a dependency on such
despotism. Brown asserted that no
one can be neutral because the
status quo is then supported.

AS A FOURTH goal. new tools
should be used to change the
present situation. Brown said
social sciences should replace
philosophy, which formerly had
been used to justify contemporary
standings. Political science and
sociology can provide data that can
help change conditions for poor,
and can help form conclusions
about world standpoints, insisted
Brown,

Brown's final and most detailed
line of direction, describedd
liberation theology theoretically as
a circular process. Specifically, he
said, people must scrutinize their
theology, then respond with, for
example, theories, political action
and interpretation. After acting,
people must again check their
theology, re-evaluate it and inv

stitute further reactions, The circle
is then drawn anew,

THIS THEORY is readily cons
ceived, but difficult to enact,
Brown noted. Accompanying the
already mentioned points, Brown
presented additional methods of
activating liberation theology.
From the outset, he said. people
must listen to the oppressed,
bearing in mind that no culture has
a monopoly on religion.

A second suggestion is to take
political action to reform the
societal structure from the grass
roots level upward. Such an effort
would include the concept of in-
dividual socialism. This would not
he socialism in the governmental
sense, but would be along the line
of small businesses operating on a
communal basis.

CONTINUING, Brown cited the
need to examine U.S. history and
reinterpret it. Brown said by
studying early church progress in
America, people can observe
struggle for equality and can learn
from this. The lesson Brown voice
is that all must stake a claim in the
battle for equality. Brown cited the
motto, “Unless all are free, none
are free."

Brown concluded that the
Church should play a vital role in
the right to equanimity and in
liberation theology as a whole. It
should assume a non-chamaeleon
stance against the status quo,
refusing to “blend in.” Churcha
and toher communities should be
loyal to the global iamily rather
than select segments of society.

Russian prof Visits

By Janet Pope

This is the second year that a
Russian teacher has been on
campus as part of the American
Field Service Teacher Exchange
Program. Ionova Irina will be here
until the second week in Novems
her.

Since she arrived in Grinnell on
September 28, Irma has been
learning about the Grinnell ex-
perience, teaching classes and
planning lectures that she will give
on campus and in town.

GRINNELL was the first college
accepted by AFS to serve as a
placement institution, explained
Russian professor, Sheila Mcs
Carthy. Most of the exchange

lrina said she attended the In-
stitute as a student. Though she
said she learned about the political
system she refused to comment on
governments of the United States
or the Soviet Union for publication.
However, she said she would be
glad to answer any questions that
students have.

IRINA has Russian senior
seminar and other language
classes. She is scheduled to par
ticipate in the Russian literature
class today.

McCarthy said Irina will visit the
elementary, junior and senior high
schools in Grinnell. In addition,
Irina is Scheduled to talk to the

teachers are placed in high
schools, McCarthy said. But the
teacher that visited Grinnell last
year gave such favorable reports
that three of this year’s six ex-
change professors are in colleges,
she said.

In the Soviet Union, lrina
teaches at the Institute of Foreign
Languages in Kiev. lrina said she
studies foreign languages to learn
more about different people and to
be able to better communicate with
them. “I think you have as many
friends as you know foreign
languagesiand I like to have
friends,” she said. Irina also
speaks Spansih.

AT THE institute, students learn
about the culture, geography,
political system, history and
literature of the country whose
language they are studying, Irina
said.

not a problem. You can go
everywhere around the world.”
She refused to comment on
government restrictions placed on
the travel of Soviet Jews.

IRINA SAID she likes Grinnell
because “it‘s very beautiful. To my
mind, cities are the same
throughout the world." she con
tinued. “Everywhere families
raise children. mothers love their
kids. Everywhere people like to

difference."

Irina said she is “well
acquainted" with the students of
the Russian department. “They're
