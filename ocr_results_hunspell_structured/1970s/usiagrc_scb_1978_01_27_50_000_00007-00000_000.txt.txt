The Scarlet S: Black, January 21, Him—page 7

 

° How come everyone reacts now? ,

by Robert Meyer

Grinnell College basketball has become one of the
most controversial topics among college affiliates.
No longer do students equivocate over political and
ethical questions, such as fighting in Viet Nam. the
granting of amnesty, the right to abortion. In»
stead Grinnellians dwell over the question of how
the heck can Grinnell help its basketball team
which has compiled a 2-31 record over the past two
seasons.

Early in the season everyone laughed about last
year’s basketball team and its “not to be talked
about” exploits. Most people chuckled at the
beginning of season when the captain, Scott Lewis,
decided that after three years of basketball at
Grinnell he discovered that he could no longer enjoy
playing the sport competitively.

After the first week of practice Peter St. Thomas,
who was regarded by last season's players and
coaches as one of the most aggressive and en-
thusiastic players, decided that he couldn‘t relive
another season like that of last. As he mildly stated,
“It was fun the firsttime, but . . ."

Within a few weeks the basketball team had lost
its captain and one of its most enthusiastic players.
These odd happenings, however, for some odd
reason, never managed to convince people that the
basketball team was destined for troubles.

Perhaps at'that particular moment the team
believed that last year was not necessarily going to
repeat itself this year. After losing two games in the
William Pen Tipoff Tournament, the Pioneers won
a surprising home opener against Simpson.

However, immediately after their victory, the

 

Pioneers literally got blown away by a very talented
(probably this year’s Midwest Conference chams
pion) Lake Forest team. Since that moment, the
Grinnellians have lost eight straight games.

These successive losses made it even more
evident that a problem exists within the present
Grinnell basketball program. Some believe that all
the blame should be placed upon the coach’s
Shoulders, others believe that the school has very
little talent to work with, However, the majority of
the campus doesn’t know what to think about the
situation and therefore tends to agree with the
vehement and uncomplimentary statements which
others have told them about the present situation.

Many people will probably never know the truth
about the reasons for the odd behavior of some when
discussing the basketball team. However, in the
near future, everyone will see some of the can,
troversial results. .

One of the results will be a mlented IM league
which will display the sophisticated basketball
skills of many ex-varsity and junior varsity players.
Another result will be an increase in attendance at
varsity games. This would usually be highly
welcomed, however, the attendance has grown
simply because many exrplayers now sit in the
stands rather than on the bench.

The attendance, however, shouldn‘t be limited to
only ex»players. Tonight‘s game will match two of
the more unsuccessful teams: Cornell (2-9) and
Grinnell (1-11). For the first time in a while, most
people believe that the Pioneers have an excellent
chance of winning.

Men’s basketball drops four more

Outgunned and undermanned,
Grinnell’s male cagers found
themselves on the deficient end of
a 101438 contest against Coe College
in Darby last Tuesday night.
Despite the lingering car-
diovascular limitations imposed by
the four week layoff, the Pioneers
unleashed their new fast break

attack. Unfortunately Coe was
more than equal to the challenge,
and Grinnell‘s record plummeted
to 1-11,

Cold shooting continued to
plague the Pioneers, while much of
Coe‘s 51439 halftime lead is ex-
plained by the phenonemal 62 per
cent clip atwhich they blistered the
nets. Compounding Grinnell’s woes

was the huge rebounding margin
Coe enjoyed at the intermission.

During the furiouslylempoed
2nd stanza, Grinnell scored the
majority of its baskets in “run and
gun" fashion. And Coe was
bothered by our full-court zone
press, thanks largely to the efforts
or lightningrquick guard Rob
Eyre, who had five steals in the
second half,

But the deficit proved in
surmountable as Coe maintained
its advantage in shooting and
under the boards, Many of the
Kohawks buckets were scored
from close range, frequently
following offensive rebounds. This
was attributed to insufficient
aggressiveness and slow reactions
on defense, which left opponents
uncovered and in position to
retrieve their teammates’ errant
caroms.

A bright spot for Grinnell was the
career-high 35 point performance
by junior guard Frank Orth, the
favorite son of Northwood, Iowa.
And the frontliners turned in a
creditable job against Coe center
Garry Archie, who likes to set up
his private headquarters ap»
proximately a foot above the rim

As coach Art Peterson noted, it
was the Pioneers’ best effort this
far in the “second season" that
follows Christmas. But they must
play closer to their potential in
order to avert similar setbacks at
the hands or the remaining teams
on their schedule. The return to
good health of forwards Phil
Guttman, Matt Miller, and Billy
Knox would also give Grinnell a
needed boost. Cornell, a very
beatable contingent, battles the
Pioneers tonight in Darby Gyms
nasium at 7:30 pm.

Just back from ten days or in
tensive workouts in Tampa, Fla.,
the bronzed (would you believe a
little bit burned) men’s swim team
will be going into action in two
exciting meets this weekend. The
firstmeet, which takes place today
in the PEG, pits Grinnell against
Wayne State, Loras, and a
vengeful Rockford team who was
edged out by the Pioneers in this
meet last year. The meet features
high school events and un-
doubtedly will be close going into
the final 400 yard relay featuring
Grinnell’s Jeff Noble, Chris Cor-
ton, Bruce Pivar, and Bruce Jones.

The swimmers then have to
recuperate by Saturday alternoon
at 12:30 for the Grinnell Relays
Eight teams will be competing for
the mastery of this unique meet.
Each team enters its top We
swimmers in each event and their
times are combined to determine
the winner of each race.

Top swimmers Bruce Jones.
Frank Halley, Jeff Noble, Brian
Jones, Greg Gomez. Dave Kapp,
Bob Lewis, Chris Corton, divers
Thomas Helpenstell and Mark
Hatherly, and the other fine
swimmers are in shape and ready
for these meets. Enthusiasm pours
out of the team’s locker room. If
you don’t believe me, walk by the
locker room and I guarantee that
you're likely to hear Charlie
Wiberalske and others pounding
out, “We are the Champions."

Donald “Mose”

January 31 marks the day in
which the supervisor of equipment
and cage personnel for the
college’s department of physical
education. Donald C. “Mose"
Killion, retires after twenty-six
years of service for the college.
In honor of Mr. Klllion, a Mose
Killion Day will be observed at
Grinnell College during tonight's
halftime intermission oi the
CornellsGrinnell basketball game.

With a hectic schedule this
weekend, the Grinnell Women’s
Swim team resumes its quest for
the Miracle Relays and for the
Association of Intercollegiate
Athletes for Women State
Championship. Friday, Nord’lern
Iowa and South Dakota visit
Grinnell while Saturday the
Pioneers travel to Rock Island,
Illinois to battle Valparaiso and
Augustana,

The second half of the season
began with a week and a half of
vigorous two~a-day workouts.
Arriving on January 10, the
athletes swam nearly twelve
thousand yards daily, the
equivalent of running over twenty-
sevenmiles! “It looks like the
team is in good shape," said Coach
Peggy Riedesel. “By this Saturday
miffed] know if all our work is paying
0 .”

The sounds effots are geared for
both the Miracle Relays and the
State Championships, The
Pioneer’s own Relays on February
4 are extremely important to the
team, but they also have their eyes
on the state meet the following
week, Since Iowa and Iowa State
will be entered at the state meet,
realistically the team's chances for
victory are slim. However the
women would love to play the role
of spoiler. “We’re swimming
against some strong teams, but
we're pretty good ourselves."
Riedesel pointed out.

Kﬂlion

Mr. Killion and his wife will both
attend the event and Will both
receive Grinnell College chairs.

Mr. Killion's value to the athletic
department can never be
calculated. Head Athletic Director
John Pfitsch says. “He is in-
valuable, we can't afford to lose
him. I know no one is invaluable.
but he is as close to invaluable as
anyone could be. He's the gut of the
outfit.”
