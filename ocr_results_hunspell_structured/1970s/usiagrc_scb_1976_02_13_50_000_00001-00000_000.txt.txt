Rosenfields:
Zafter Vietnam

by Bill Burke.

Marc Geller and

Celia Goldwag
The Cold War and the American
xperience in Vietnam have
esulted in renewed critical
thinking about the nature oi United
States ioreign policy. This year’s
Rosenfield Lecture Series brings
together three individuals who are
vitally concerned about this issue.
The lecture program will be held
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Walter LeFeber, Thomas Hughes
and Paul Warnke are distinguished
representatives of somewhat
different approaches to the crisis
gacing American ioreign policy
makers in the post-Vietnam era.
Walter LeFeber, Noll Professor
iHistory at Cornell University, is
ﬁne oi the ioremost proponents of
ﬁthe radical or revisionist in-
terpretation oi American
diplomatic history. The revisionist
school questions the assumption
that American ioreign policy has
‘consistently been well-intentioned
and realistic. Finding the roots oi
United States policies in domestic
economic and social structures,
LeFeber is part of a
historiographical tradition
grounded in the works oi Charles
Beard and, more recently, those oi
, "l lliam Appleman Williams.
Revisionists take exception to the
notion that American actions in the
Cold War were a realistic response
to a ”Red menace," directed by
M cow, that threatened Western
1 ization. They recognize that
the United States bears at the very
least an equal share ol the blame.
According to revisionist history,
Vietnam should not be seen as an
aberration. Rather, United States
actions there must be viewed as
part oi a global pattern in the post
”QWorld War II world.

Assistant

Secretary of .Defense for In-,

ternational Security Aiiairs irom
mid 1967 until the end of the
Johnson administration. has
reacted differently to recent
American diplomacy. While in the
Defense Department, he spoke out
against continued escalation of the
Vietnam War. Warnke is currently
being touted as a likely choice for
Secretary or State in a Democratic
administration. He is generally
considered to be a member of the
new liberal Democratic establish
ment which holds that future
American activism must be
concerned with more than
maintaining stability. This view is
an implicit critiq of Henry
Kissinger’s realpolitik. Harmony
in the international arena will only
he achieved when the in-
terdependence oi nations is
recognized. Accordingly,
American policy must promote
progress and development in third
world nations, regardless of their
relative importance in balance of
power politics,

Thomas Hughes, president of the
Carnegie Endowment tor In-
ternational Peace, has served in
both the legislative and executive
branches oi the government. He
has strong ties to the old liberal
wing of the Democratic party and
it also considered a likely
possibility tor a cabinet post should
a Democrat be elected President in
1976. In a recent Foreign Policy
article he discusses what he sees as
the problems oi American ioreign
policy in a revolutionary world. He
criticizes the Kissinger approach
which views America largely as
preserver oi the status quo. He is
attempting to find a way for
America to line up with the
“ascendant forces" in the world,
He findsin the American traditions
oi liberalism and populism the
basis for a new coalition which can
reorient American policy.

Admissions rise

By T. Elaine Carey

Admissions applications are 31
per cent higher this year than last
year, announced Admissions Dean
Nicholas Ryan. As oi February 9,
the Admissions Dean had received
713 applications, compared with
543 on the same date in 1975.

Several other changes have
occurred in Admissions this year
including Ryan‘s resignation, the
dissolution of the Black Ad-
missions Board. the simpliiying oi
the admissions application, and the
elimination oi a required applicant
interview. Ryan said,

Calling admissions an “inexact
science” with no pattern, Ryan has
no explanation lor the drop in
applications over the last five
years nor tor the upswing this
year.

Female applications, which
dropped last year, number 100
more this year so iar, Ryan said
The male counthas increased also,
the dean added

Eastern applications have
leveled off, Ryan noted, while
Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, and
California applications have in
creased.

Other ACM schools are ex
periencing the same surge, Ryan
noted. A few of Grinnell’s closest
competitors, though, are still down
in applications. Ryan commented.

Over the last five year period,
the ACM schools have had a 20.2
per cent drop in applications
received and Grinnell has had a
23.1 per cent decrease, Ryan said.
Also, the number of enrolled new
students has fallen over the five
years with the ACM averaging a to
per cent loss, while Grinnell
declined 13.9 per cent, Ryan
reported.

Dean Ryan resigned June 25,
1975. as admissions dean because
he was concerned with his division
oi “lime and energy” between the
Admissions Office and the Student
Financial Aid Office which he also
heads.

The faculty dissolved the Black
Admissions Board Jan. 19. The
college received a letter from the
Health, Education, and Welfare
Department indicating that a
separate black admissions board
was unacceptable, Ryan ex-
plained. When the faculty
dismantled the board, Walker
promised that the admissions
board would be sensitive to black
needs, Ryan said

Maurice Hunt, former chairs
person of the black board, will sit
on the Admissions Board for the
remainder oi this year when the

board considers black students.

Next year, Ryan said, the Ada
missions Board will have a black
iaculty member.

”i thought I would sit on the
whole board and so did HEW,”
Huntsaid. Hunt said that he didn’t.
understand immediately that he
Wouldn't be sitting on the board for
all cases this year. HEW called
Monday to check the restructuring
of the board and told Hunt that the
situalion would still be unac-
ceptable if he joined the board for
only black cases. However, Hunt
said, HEW would take no action
until an official complaint was
lodged,

Hunt will not be a board member
next year because the Admissions
Board is a faculty board and Hunt
is not a faculty member.

The Black Admissions Board
was created in December 1971 in
response to demands voiced by
Concerned Black Students during
the library takeover at that time,
Hunt hasn't received any adverse
reaction to the termination of the
board because CBS understands
the legality involved, he said.

”A shorter, iriendiier approach"
was instituted with the application
iorm, Ryan said. The iull page on
special talents has been removed
and the sections on health and
activities has been shortened
Admissions counselor Damsgaard
believes that the shortened form
will resultin a lower rate of
enrollment after admission
because it is easier for the student
to complete more applications,
said.

Ending the required interview
has put orinneli “into the main-
stream rather than outside the
norm,” Ryan said. Grinnell was
the only ACM school which still
demanded the interview, the dean
added. Many of these interviews
were conducted by alumni with
outdated information on the
college, Ryan said.

The counselors and Ryan aren’t
sure about.the interview change
because that session provided the
student with another opportunity to
have personal contact With the
college and obtain more in
formation.

The admissxons booklet has been
revamped this year. too. Ryan
saidGWen Carter and Damsgaard
think the new booklet,
“Questions," has more ins
iormation presented in a more
organized way.

Attracting blacks and iowans
still troubles the admissions staff.
An increase 111 black enrollments in
predominately black colleges is the
highest it has been in a decade,
Ryan noted. Grinnell 'and other
similar institutions are losing to
this national trend, the dean ad
ded

Still fewer than 10 per centof the
applications are irom iowans.
Ryan said, Damsgaard, who
covers lowa, said that the type of
student Grinnell seeks in Iowa
oiten wants to go out of state.
