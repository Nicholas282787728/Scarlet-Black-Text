 

Students discuss sexuality

by Dan Flynn

Sex: one ofule most talked about
subjects on college campuses. Too
often though, according to RA.
Tom Arner, the topic is not treated
seriouslyi _

In an effort to bring sex into
serious focus, the Office of Student
Affairs is once again sponsoring a
sexuality symposium. An an
nual event, formerly run by outside
experts, the symposium has been
run by the Office of Student Affairs
for the last two years.

THE symposium is not a sex
clinic, Indeed, it could better he
called a personal awareness work»
shop. “The workshop is designed
to make people more aware of
themselves," according to Arner, a
coordinator of the event. “Students
should leave the workshop better in
touch with their feelings about
themselves, about others, about
sex.”

The symposium is divided into
two parts: lectures and a two-day
workshop. Held earlier this week,
the lectures concentrated on sex
information and issues. Nick
Tormey, who is a Ph. D. candidate
in Psychotherapy and Human
Sexuality, was the featured
speaker, His talks included
presentations of basic anatomy
information and discussions of
current sexerelated issues and
values.

 

TONIGHT at seven the second
part of the symposium begins. This
section is designed to be ex
periential rather than in-
formational,

For most of me workshop, the
participants will be divided into
groups of six, Students will be
confronted with a concept and
asked to come to grips widl their
own feelings on the subject. The
discussions that follow will
hopefully offer new insights on the
subject to the participants, From
this the participant should gain a
better understanding of him or
herself.

ARNER feels that the group
discussions can be the best part of
the workshop. He contends that if
the groups have people from
diverse backgrounds, the overall
effect will be better. Through in-
teraction with the group, members
will be confronted with a variety of
new ideas which they will have to
deal with, Through open com»
munication with others, each
group member should better un-
derstand his or her own sexuality.

Besides the small group
discussions, films and exerciss
are also planned, “The workshop is
different this year,” Arner says.
“Last year we had a lot of films
and less time in the small groups.
But the student evaluations in-
dicated that although the movies

were helpful, the time spent in the
groups was more helpful. So this
year we have less films."

A JUNIOR who attended a past
lworkshop questioned the ef-
Eiectiveness of the groups, “The

discussions really turned me off.

'There were all of these people
i sitting there, pretending to be
l sincere. Maybe they were all
opening {up—but the whole thing
struck me as fake.”

But for others the past
workshops have been helpful. “It
, was one of the most useful ex-

periences We had at Grinnell,"
according to one sophomore.

SOME (IF the ideas that par-
ticipants will be asked to consider
include: attitudes towards 0 es
own body; attitudes towa ds
others' bodies; masculinit -
femininity stereotypes; dlfr
ferences between sensuality and
sexuality; and values in
relationships. -

The workshop will start out
rather structured, and then
develop into a more open format
Areas in which participants want
more discussion will then be
focused on. and the latter part of
the workshop should shape itself,',

”In the end, the participant should i
know himself better,” Arner feels.
“Not just in a sexual sense—but all

 

around, He should understand;
himself in a much fuller way."

New law: only crooks copy books ‘

other material equaling more than
10 per cent of an entire work may
be distributed in class.

SPONTANEITY means that
copying may be done without
permission, and under the above
guidelines, provided that UTere is
not enough time for a teacher to
contact an author or publisher and
receive a response.

Cumulative effectﬁ'p'l'aces
restrictions on the usage of copied
material, Under the law, copied
works are to be used only in the
course for which the copies were
originally made. In other words, if
a teacher passes out material at
the semester’s beginning, and then
collects it at semester's end, the
teacher may not re-use that
material without again receiving
permission and paying new
royalties,

PANDOLFO and Walker em-
phasized that these are guidelines.
not rules. This is easily discerned
by the ambiguity of the above
crlteria. People who read the law
are immediately prompted to ask
“What if . . ,7”

The new laws are admittedly
experimental. Boﬂi Pandolfo and
Walker readily concede that en-
forcement of the laws, which are
administered by the Copyright
Office of the Library of Congress,
is next to impossible,

BUT. Walker added that any
teacher who did get caught
violating the laws would be on their
own. The college would take no
responsibility.

What are the direct effects of the
new law on the college? Dean
Walker Said that the costs to the
college in word processing will be
reduced. Walker stressed,
however, that the real cost of the
law would be in the inconvenience
it will cause students and
professors.

THE LAW is having a
pronounced effect on the library.
Steve Pandolfo stated that the use
of the IrLITE system is restricted
under the new laws. only five
copies per journal may be made
during a year. This may have an
effect on research activities if
many students require the use of
the same journals not available at
Burling Library. ,

The reserve section of the library

semester. Students have found
themselves battling at the reserve
desk to get their hands on the only
copy of material the law will allow
to be kept on reserve.
TEACHERS reacted to the new
laws by stressing the in-
convenience they experience in
obtaining course materials A]
Jones of the History Department
remarked that the laws complicate
the teaching process. He said they
were a “legal, bureaucratic
hassle," and another step “in the
commercialization of learning."

materials. “There seems to be
some sense of security to students
in having a copy of the material
with them,” she said. She went on
to note that having a personal copy
makes students feel it is un-
necessary to take notes or devote
much effort to reading or thinking.

A] Jones thought that one good
outcome of the laws would be that
publishers might be encouraged to
produce better anthologies, These
new anthologies would hopefully
[ill the gap in providing materials
for wideranging courses.

Walleer added that any teacher

caught violating

the laws would

be on their own. The college

would take no responsibility.

Lenore Durkee, who teaches
Electronmicroscopy. said the laws
did not affect her course much, but
indicated that other teachers of
science courses were affected By
developing and producing their
own original course materials,
science teachers have avoided the
problem of copying, Ms. Durkee
added,

SOCIOLOGY professor llse
Leitinger offered an optimistic
View. She believes many students
have become lazy in their note-
taking and recall of copied

STEVE Pandolfu mentioned the
possibility that a deluge of requests
for copy permission might force
publishers to be more generous in
allowing their materials to be
copied. No publisher would like to
see their company inundated with
a bureaucratic jumble of requests.

0n the other hand, even if the
situation does not change, Pane
dolfo predicted that it would be
“just one more nuisance that we
squawk about. . . but then get used
to after awhile,”

be almost impossible to apply in
the math and science departments,
where courses must be taken
sequentially,

Any solution, however, must
take into account the liberal arts
premises upon which the college is
based. One of the college’s
strongest selling points has been its
low ratio of students to professors,
resulting in small classes.

EVEN the polieies Walker has
proposed could lead to scheduling

difficulties that might constrain a
student's field of choice. Informed
of the problem, one student exr
claimed, “That's terrible! I don’t
feel I have enough choice as it is,”

Walker‘s reaction to this
statement was, “I think my answer
to that student would be that some
of our departments offer a much
more specialized range of courses
than most small colleges can af-
ford.”

Natker appointed SC

by Julie Brand

Maris Natker was appointed
student coordinator by Jon
Neiderbach and approved by Joint
Boards at their meeting last
Wednesday night

Natker, assistant student
coordinator last semester, is
replacing Gary Doernhoefer who
resigned at the beginning of this
semester. There were only two
applicants for the position, despite
two notices in the campus memo
and a week long search by
President Neiderbach.

“IT'S FKUSTRATING that so
many people have quit and that so
few people apply,” lamented
Neiderbach. “It’s a big problem
trying to find someone who wants
to put the time in " He later added,
“It seems that those who talk the
loudest about student activism
either don’t want to work through
the system (therefore the system
doesn’t change), or cite a large
academic load," ‘ _

Natker is the only remaining
original member of the coor-
dinator's office from the previous
semester. The two other assistant
coordinators, Mark Sherinian and
Patty Jipp, quit at the end of last
Semester. Sherinian, who left in
early December, was replaced by
Cornell Rudov before the semester
ended, Natker is currently con-
sidering applications for Jipp’s and
her own vacated positions.

THE COMMON complaint
among the resigned coordinators
is the amount of time the job
required. Jipp complained that
“the offlce as an institution has
expanded beyond the limits of what
four people can accomplish and
remain Students,” Doernhoefer
estimated that his job demanded 20
hours to over 40 hours a week.
“The long hours always came at

the worst time of the ymr, during
finals and midterms, because
the Shuttle services were offered
then," he said. Most assistants
approximated their Work week to
run anywhere from 20 to 30 hours.

THE STUDENT Coordinator’s
Office provides services for
students, such as the recent used
books sale, the Grapevine. pet.
plant. and stereo sitting services as
well as the Chicago, Des Moines
and Cedar Rapids buses ~It»also ;'
-acts as a liaison between the
various student committees and
the SGA. The latest project, begun
by Cornell Rudov, which will allow
students to rent refrigerators for a
‘fee, will begin within a few weeks,

The pay for the student coor~
dinator is $350 per year, and
assistants receive $250. “01)-
‘viously, the people aren’t
motivated by the money," Doer~
Inhoefer reﬂected. “I made more
than that in the three weeks over
break.” Cornell Rudov said “If
they were to pay us equitably we’d
leave the school as millionaires."

The experience seems to be the
most motivating factor. Doern-
hoefer thought that the benefits
varied. “It's a job with real highs
and real pits—like walking into
exams totally unprepared.”

THE INCREDIBLE amount of
time spent working on the various
projects and other duties took its
toll on the coordinators’
academics: This was the major
reason cited for resignations,
Doernhoeier, a junior, said, “My
academics really took a beating. I
had to ask myself did I really do as
good a job in either place, and my
answer Was no. It was a problem of
diminishing returns,” He admitted

 

his grade point average for last
semester was a whole point lower
