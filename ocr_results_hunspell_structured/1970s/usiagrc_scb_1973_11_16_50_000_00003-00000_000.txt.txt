The Pet Policy: 'Eddie gets more excited about Homer than I do.’

Pet Problems Peeve Campus

(Ed. note--Numerous general com—
plaints about infractions of the col-
lege pet policy have been received
by the pet Board, but members of
the Board say they chnnotact unless
they receive a formal, specific com-
plaint against the animal causing
problems

We assigned Scarlet and Black staff
writer Jr Crnnston Snord to delve
into the pet problem. Snord returned
to our offices Tuesday with the fol»
lowing...he swears that every word
is true, but the names have been
changed to protect the innocent.)

After being accosted late one even-
ing to do an expose on the petprob-
lem at Grinnell College, I went to
the usual sources for information
and came up with the usual dull news
story. However, one or those inter—
viewed (who shall forever remain
anonymous) revealed to me where
I could get in touch with the leader
of “Renegades, Unlimited,” a none
profit dog pack. The leader, a Mr.
Hound Dawg, related to me some oi
the more interesting experiences he
and his trDupe have had in the last
three months of running and hiding
from Pet Board authorities, nar—.
rowly escaping capture on more
than one occasion.

ON THE UP AND UP

“There's just no competition here
as compared to the big city," he
told me. “I mean there are nocars
or trucks, no gangs of delinquent
hoodlums shooting zip~guns at us,
and, most importantly, no competir
tion from rats, In the ‘Big Apple’
I led a ‘dog’s lii'e,’ but here, as you
can see, I live like a king. These

‘yokel' dogs belong on farms;
they’re just not tough like me and
my boys."

When asked about his “master,"
Mr. Dawg let out a loud “yelp.”
“Don't talk to me aboutthat creep!”
he barked, “I haven't seenhim since
the day we got here. But whenever i
want to move in on anybody (for
even us hoodlums need love and
affection), I do so, and I don’t care
who it is or where it is. These
stupid ‘no pet’ floor policies arefor
the birds. l simply don’t believe
in them,”

Seeing that he took my bait, laskr
ed about some of the exploits of his
pack.

“I’m glad you asked that," he re—
plied. ”Me and my boys have done
a darn good job turning this came

ian ﬁrm which has been advertising
a discount dictionary offer has gen-
erated a considerable number of
complaints to the Toronto Better
Business Bureau according to a Bus
reau official.

A spokesman at the BBB said in
a telephone interview Thursday that
the complaints have alleged nonvde—
livery of dictionaries.

In addition, the spokesman reports
receiving numerous complaints
from publishers who have carried
the firm’s advertising, but havebeen
unable to collect payment due,

The firm, Ontario Text Editions,
has been running ads offering Web—
ster Dictionaries with a list price
of $45.00 for $15.00, plus postage
and handling charges.

Respondents to the advertisement
are asked to send the money to
Dictionary Liquidation in care of
the publication in which the offer
appears.

Persons seeing this advertisement
or similar ads are advised to check
with their local Better Business
Bureau before responding, accord-
ing to the Toronto one spokesman,

(‘divide and conquer' i always say),
we’ve bitten one student, thrown
another oil his hike, snapped at
a maid, ‘accosted’ a Boo guy, and
molested a young girl.”

"I needn’t bother mentioning the
excellent luck we’ve had ‘jumping’
kids coming out of the dining halls
(stealing food from those who are
stealing lood--Robin Hood has 31,
ways been one of my folk her-
oes) or the jobs we’ve done in some
of the lounges. That's not exactly
a great record, nor is it up to my
standards, but it's adequate, What
else can you expect in small town
America? You can only raise so
much hell,”

Looking quite stunned (for i had
never heard the likes of these ep»
isodes), I asked him what the schr
001 is doing to combat his mar-
auding. “You’ve got to be kidding,"
he responded laughingly. “i mean
the people here are so aplthetjcal
that they can‘t even complain whole
heartedly. All they have to do to
muzzle canine crime is to iormally
complain (in writing) to the Pet
Board (consisting of Nina Adams,
Rick Faust, and Onishious Jones)
or to that Rikoon character (Sandy
‘Spider Weh' Rikoon, alias ‘TheDog
Catcher)"

“Kids here always want to go
to the top—Jo Mr. Big. They bother
the ‘big wheels’uthe Deans and
the likeuwhen all they have to do
is make a formal complaint (andl
personally dare them to do so;
i know who the troublemakers are!).
in the meantime, me and my boys
are free to roam the campus as we
will. Like man we thrive on apathy;
