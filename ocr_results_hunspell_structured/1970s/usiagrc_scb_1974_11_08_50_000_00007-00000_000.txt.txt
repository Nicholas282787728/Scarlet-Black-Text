The Grinnell 0b Squad, founded in 1967, ls an
independant coeducational institution of long and
respected standing. For those people who haven‘t
been to one of this year's Grinnell College football
games, the 0b Squad is a group of students who act
as a cheering section to rat: and rip the opposition
and inspire Grinnell’s teams to impossible heights
of athletic prowess.

Through their collective subtleties, the squad
’ members learn the line art of constructive criticism
simply by adhering to the principle of being ob-
noxious, obscene. obvious, and obtuse. Their en-
thusiasm and vocal powers do seem to add a rather
interesting dimension to Grinnell athletics.
Location

During lnotball games, the squad is rooted on the
fifty yard line in the solid cement stands of Ward
Field. And like these stands, though crumbling at
parts, the 0b Squad Cheers the team on to the very
end. The excited waving of red and black pennants,
the uninhibited vocal cords, and the rather large
mass of terment will tip ott any perceptive observer
to the location or this stronghold of spirit standing
firm admist a sea of intellectualism.

Objectives

According to Robin Cowen, the intrepid leader
and guiding spirit of the squad, the objectives are
(1) to cheer Grinnell College teams on and (2) to do
this Cheering in an obnoxious way. The idea is not to
cut down Grinnell teams, but rather to raise them
above the weight of apathy by the very buoyancy oi
hot air.

The squad also possesses an ever-ready fund of
cheers, A list of these cheers is here submitted [or
the serious student:

“Give me a T—R- AS-TrE-E. What does it spell?
Power!

“Give me a P, Give me all A, Give me an R, Give
me an E, Give me an N, Give me a T, Give me an S.
What does it spell? Money!

eering: Ob

“liyou can’t go to college go to Knox."

Or it our team is behind: "We've got higher board
scores?"

“Elnasculatc. emasculate, make them relinuuish
the ball."

History

The characteristics of Grinnell‘s Ob Squad
today—its liberal spirit. excellence of scholarship,
its social concernsihave evolved through a long
eight-year history, into what today is reverantly
known as the Grinnell 0b Squad. Some of the
milestones of its development are:

First Ob Squad west of the Mississippi:

First ob Squad to be covered by the Chicago
Tribune; and

First 0b Squad to be discussed on a Waterloo
television news boradcast.

Throughout its history the 0b Squad has been
noted “as one of the more fun traditions at Grinr
nell," Cowen stated. As of late however, the squad
has dwindled to ten regular members headed by
Robin Cowen.

She expressed some concern over the future of the
squad. “It would be pretty sad to lose it,“ Coweh
said, and she tears it may die out like the late
Grinnell cheerieading squad which pooped out when
the leading member graduated.

Future?

The 0b Squad also hopes to be active throughout
this ‘year's athletic season, Basketball games
provide an opportunity for more personal ob»
npxmusness since the seats are so much closer to
the players. '

The tradition of Oh Squad is summed up in this
revision oi the Iowa State song:

“We're the pioneers, pioneers
Bestschool in the land. joint in every hand,
We're the pioneers. pioneers

That's where the tall grass grows,”
