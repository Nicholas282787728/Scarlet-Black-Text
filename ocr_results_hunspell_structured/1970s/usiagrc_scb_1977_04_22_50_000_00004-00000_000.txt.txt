Need energy action

Last fall President Turner formed an energy committee to
examine energy consumption at the college and discuss
future conservation proposals and plans. However, the
committee has accomplished little since its formation and is
not much closer to specific proposals or plans than it was last
fall.

Members of the committee disagree about what their
function is Some members think the committee's prime
function should be to educate the campus community about
the ways to conserve energy, while others think that the
committee should perform a technical role by determining
ways of minimizing energy use on campus.

We agree that data needs to be collected so that a
systematic study and proposals for decreased energy use can
be made. The college spent about $6400 on meters to monitor
steam and electricity entering campus buildings. With that
kind of money commitment, the meters should be installed
and the data should be collected, and analyzed by the
committee, as quickly as possible.

We also think that the committee can and should play an
important role in educating the campus community about
fuel conservation measures. Awareness can be increased by
speakers and movies, and especially by the committee asking
people to take specific measures in their lives at Grinnellu

Lights should be turned off all over campus when not in
use. Hall lights need to be on only from dusk until two in the
morning. In the loggias, one light outside each dorm when it
is dark would be sufficient lighting.

In particular buildings, it is usually obvious who should be
most responsible for turning off lights, such as food service
managers being responsible for the dining halls,‘

Where responsibility is not obvious, everyone should
remember to ﬂick the switches off when leaving. But having
specific people informally responsible for specific areas is
more likely to bring positive results than merely asking
everyone to pitch in. For example, S.A.'s should be
responsible for turning off lights in bathrooms, hall reps for
turning off lounge lights and professors for switching off
lights in classrooms and labs. 7

Heat levels on campus need to be turned down lower at
night than they have been in previous winters.

Because 3&6 does not monitor temperature levels Within
buildings, students, faculty, and administrators need to
inform B&G when their rooms are too hot as well as when
they are too cold. It is better to have the heat turned down
and the energy saved than to open a window.

Most importantly, Grinnell needs an energy policy. The
Energy Committee should be more vigorous in collecting
and analyzing data, in developing long-term and short~term
conservation policies, and in encouraging everyone to
conserve energy. If need be, committee members should
divide up responsibility for data collection and information
dissemination, so that instead of arguing about committee
functions they could get things done

‘Black perspective’ confusing

To the editor: I am writing this
letter in response to the article that
appeared in last week‘s Scarlet &
Black entitled “The black per
spective," submitted by Concerned
Black Students. and written by a
group requesting that their names
be withheld. I found this article to
be, in many ways, very in-
consistent, and it therefore served
to only add to my confusions with
regard to the racial problems at
Grinnell.

The most lucid point in the ar-
ticle was the statement, “It‘s
difficult to explain an abstract
need to those who have never
experienced it.” However. the
authors then failed to elaborate on
the nature of that abstract need,
The problem is that only the
demands, and not the actual goals,
are made clear in the article. As in
the past, it is not at all clear as to
what is trying to he achieved.

The closest thing to an exact
statement of goals was: “We do not
want to assimilate. We are Black."
Also: “We want to be equal and to
be Black.” However, this comes
across as a rather vague, un-
specific direction toward which to
move. The article then proceeds to
list eight needs, essential in
meeting the aforementioned goals.
It should be evident that the white
community cannot possibly fulfill
these requests without first un-
derstanding what will be ac-
complished.

My disappointment comes from
the lack of progress that has been
made in this area over the last few
years. As a freshman, becoming
frustrated with the hostility that I
received from black studens, 1

 

wrote a letter to the Scarlet &
Black. expressing my
dissatisfaction with the overall
racial situation at Grinnell. The
only request in me letter was for a
willingness on his part of all
students to communicate, to allow
the free exchange of black and
white ideas. ,

With only a few exceptions. this
letter received widespread
disapproval from the blacks on
campus. I was told on countless
occasions that such an attempt at
communication would be futile and
that my erroneous thinking came
directly from my misunr
derstanding of the black cultural
needs. I found no one who. was
willing to elaborate on the notions
of “blackness" or “equality." I
feel' that if such a misun-
derstanding really does exist, then
the need for a great deal of com-
munication is even more pressing.

The article last week stated that
needs of the blacks will be
elaborated in future articles. The
truth is that it is not these needs
that should be discussed until the
goals are crystal clear. until it is
fully understood What is meant by
“blackness" and “equality.” The
article states: “We do not want to
be White and just like everyone
else. We are different.” Well, I am
white and Still I am not just like
everyone else, Therein rests my
inability to understand that
statement,

The final need mentioned in the
article is that of “cooperation, not
competition.” The article states:
“We are not as armed as you for
battle, Surely we would lose.” Not

Avoid Dibble pit

To the editor: Number draw time
has come around again and we of
Dibble Pit havea few words for the
wise concerning our dwelling,
First, through a Simple series of
linguistic transformations, we can
arrive at the true meaning of
“Dibble.” The word immediately
suggests “nibble," an activity of
rats, which are “horrible," often
found in a “hovel,” or among
“rubble." Rubble, of course, is a
collection of remnants of a
previous structure, and herein lies
the true meaning of Dibble Pit.
The Fit, formerly a basement
storeroom, had its original pur-
pose destroyed when builders
attempted to convert it into four
dormitory rooms. The builders
failed. The Pit is now neither a
basement storeroom nor a set of
rooms fit for human habitation. It
is rubble, remnants of a previous

basement, a filthy place with
paperrthin walls, an improvised
bathroom, and noisy pipes which
shock us out of our sleep every
night, even warm nights when
there is no good reason for the
pipes to be hot,

Thre are no rats in Dibble Pit,
only metaphorical rats, the
humans foolish enough to live
there, but there are plenty of in
sects. Throughout the academic
year in room 604 we have smashed
20 black roaches, 16 files, 14
mosquitoes, 12 hornets, G ants, 4
spiders, 4 centipedes, and a
cockroaches. These figures are not
our invention; we have kept
careful records.

With this new information, we
hope no one will make our mistake
of choosing to live in such a
deplorable place. Ed Peaco and
Mark Maire

 

only am I personally offended by
this statement, but I Should like to
call attention to the note of hostility
with which this article begins, The
second paragraph begins with:
“Please excuse my grammar and
spelling You see, where I coring
from those things were not ems
phasized. We were taught to
think and to comprehend," The
implied logic is that those who ar
taught to spell and to use correc ,
grammarare incapable of thinking
and comprehending, that there is
some type of mutual exclusion to
the notions.

The paragraph continues: “My
experience at Grinnell has been
memorizing and spelling it right
The split. In my .real life i‘ve
learned, in my role l’ve
memorized." This is a serious
accusation leveled at the quality of
education at Grinnell. Although .1
am not enchanted with some oft
methods at Grinnell, I feel that this
statement actually says more
about the author than the school. I
am somewhat disgusted at th
blatant exaggeration, comin,S
across as a plea of oppression. I
challenge any student, white or
black, to argue for, or even sign
such a statement.

Iwould like to make it clear that
there is, of course, a need for a
”black perspective" column in the
Scarleldr Black. ltis this, precisely
this type of communication that I
am endorsing. However, I feel that
the content of this particular a
ticle must be re-examined. g
welcome any responses, eithe ,
personally or through the Scarlet &
Black. Jon Herman _

Laments low
response rate

To the editor: Thanks to all who
worked on Grapevine VI, It is
unfortunate that the efforts put int

the Grapevine were hampered b, ,
the low percentage of question-
naires returned. It is poor
showings like this that give
credence to those who charge that

it is only a vocal minority oiI‘r
students who pester the ad-‘
ministration about student input.
More importantly, the low
response rate is a sign that a
disappointingly small number of
students here are concerned about
the education they are receiving at
