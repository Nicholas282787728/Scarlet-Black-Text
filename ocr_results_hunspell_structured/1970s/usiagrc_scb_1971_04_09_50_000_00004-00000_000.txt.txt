PHOSPHATES ARE BAD! !
it has been proven that phosphates are a critical element in
the process involved in the decay and death of lakes and other
bodies of water. They are also involved in the algae bloom
cycles which result in oxygen depletion of bodies of water,
killing fish and other aerobic life.

BeﬂsOpens HisiorySymposium

by Debbie McKnight

Raymond Betts opened the
Symp0sium on Modern Imer-

ialism Tuesday night with the
lecture "Space, Power, and
Empire." Betts‘ remarks on
European empires in the nine-
ties provided background im-
pressions for the twelverday
sympOsium. He suggested that
Europe in the nineties was
meglomaniac and offered the
Eiffel Tower and the ”Tit
mnic" as symbols ofthatprer
occupation.

"Imperialism was the most
disturbing form of hyperbole
of the age."

Europeans began to equate
land with power, which Cecil
Rhodes indicated by saying,
“Rails are less expensive than
guns and go farther." Ann
other Briton tailed a frontier
“the best education outside
the English university." Th-
ere was an obsession with the
supposed beneficial effects of
owning great open spaces. A
British writer justified his
country's occupation of India:

”Vastness of territory is
necessary to insure nobility
of action and breadth of [11’
ought."

"The Centaurian, a con~
temporary novel of colonial
administration, took its title
from those Roman soldiers
who served at the outposts of
the great empire’s civiliza-
tion. To Betts, this indicated
European identifitation with
imperial Roman glory.

Betts provided at least one
rather novel explanation for
the source of European ems
pire: the success of the Am-
erican federation. "What
really proved the value of
a federation in European eyes
was' America's surviving its
Civil War. Then, despite the
necessarily trans~oceanicnat
ture of a British or French
empire, bOth began to look
feasible. Steam power and
coaling stations encouraged

this. Europeans talked of the
sea as a highway and of ships
as analogous to transcontinr
ental railroads in the U.S."

The hastilycbuilt European
overseas empires crumbled
after only a few decades be-
cause of vast cultural differ-
ences betwe n colonizer and
colonized. The goals of the
colonies were always those of
the settler, never of the na-
tives. This total disregard of
indigenous people had to bring
about the end of colonialdom-
ination.

“The days of an imperial
occupying country are rather
certainly dead," said Betts.
The desire to conquer space
is less pronounced today, but
”power politics are still with
us, of course. Can we look at
the defeat of the SST as a set
back for speed and power?
Probably not. Look atthe cars
Americans drive . Imperial,
Eldorado, Continental. The
urge is still there."

Wall Tells Carnegie War Views

“1 am going to be talking
largely about Andrew Chrne-
gie. I‘m also going to read
some things from my book on
assumption that you
haven't read it , and certainly
no one has gotten to page 700
yet.”

Joseph Wall continued the
Symposium on Modern imper—
ialism Wednesday night with
his lecture on “The Antir
Imperialists of 1898." He
dealt with the Anti‘Imperlak
ist League, a national organ-
ization of prominent men whr
ich included Andrew Carne-
gie.

There were inconsistencies
in Carnegies position, asWall
pointed out: "Although he had
for many years trumpeted his
pacifist views,healsoengaged
in weapons manufacture and
was actively in favor ofefforts
to absorb Canada into the Unir
ted States. "

When American involvement
in the Philippines came, Cart
negie wrote violent letter to
newspapers, protesting the
crime of shooting down Philr
ippinos. As one critic obser-
ved, Carnegie had not been
quite so concerned when gov
ernment troops shot down Amr
ericans during the strike at
his own Homestead plant.

“Just as anti-imperialists
today are not willing to serve
as world policemen so Car~
negie and his like did notwant
to act as world preachers and
teachers," Wall explained. He
quoted a letter writteiLby Car-
negle on the war in the Phil-
ippines:

Ripoff Gets Repaid

Recent rip offs at Grinnell
have affected not only studr
ents, but also B and G per-
sonnel. me afternoon a few
weeks ago, the disappearance
of a purse owned by Maddy
Thompson, matron in the sci-
ence building, was reported.
The purse was later found
emptied of $135 and an ex-
pensive prescription of thy-
roid pills. Students and {ac
ulty began a collection to re-
place the lost funds and were
successful in achieving their
goal. Maddywas overjoyedand
asked that the following note
of thanks be published in the
S St E to show that not all the
rumors about Grinnell Col-
lege students are true:

To students and Science fac-
ulty:

Words cannot express my
appreciation for helping me
out in a time of need. lparti-
cularly want'to thank all the
students for their all out ef-
fort in collecting.

Thank you,
Maddy

Evaluation 0! Courses Planned

Students this spring will he
presented with a form in each
of their courses asking them
to evaluate theirinstructors in
each of a dozen areas. The
forms will all remain confi-
dential, but they will be used
as part of the evaluation of an
instructor seeking promotion,
tenure or rehiring.

The form was drawn up by
three students and one faculty
member on the Subcommittec
on Eduwtional Policy, appro-
ved by that subcommittee and
then approved by the faculty
Executive Council.

The form asks for ratings of
poor, fair, good or excellentin
the following areas: overall
performance of instructor,
grasp of subject matter, clarr
ity of presentation, adequacy
of preparation, stimulation of

student intellectual curiosity,
fairness of assigned work,
fairness of grading, open-
mindedness, availability out—
side of class, skill in leading
discussion, and balance be‘
tween lecture and discussion.

A final question asks if the
student would recommend the
instructor to a good friend
with similar interests to him'
self, and space is provided
for additional comments.

All forms will be compiled
and used by the Executive
Council (or other body with
oversight on personnel mat—
ters) when making personnel
decisions.

It is anticipated that the
forms will be distributed dur
ing the last week or two of
classes, and that every effort
will be made to have them
completed by every student.

"There will be no civilizing
mission from us because the
only Americans whowill come
into contact with natives are
soldiers, themselves in gIEak
er need of missionaries than
the natives. O the pity that
Philippine and American mo~
there should both mourn the
deaths of their sons, the one
in the defense of his country,
the other an invader."

Carnegie worked hard for
the defeat of the Treaty of
Paris, which would give the
United States Guam, ' Puerto
Rico, and the Philippines.The
treaty was ratified with one
vote to spare, but Carnegie
maintained his optimism. He
wrote at the end of the cen-
tury that perhaps within the
next hundred years "the pros
fession of arms will be the
most disgusting of all."

”There isa tremendous tem-
ptation," Wall admitted, "to
draw parallels between inter
vention in the Philippines in
1898 and intervention in Viet
Nam."

Americans in the Philippines

practiced unbelievable brutaa
lity against native people. One
officer was courtrmartiolled
in 1902 for murdering civilc
ians. His defense was that he
had been following orders to

"burn and kill.”

Carnegie offered McKinley
$20 million to give the Philr
ippines their independence,
“surely the only instance in
history of a private citizen
offering to buy an empire
from a sovereign state." The
anti-imperialists were ang-
ered by Kipling‘s ”pseudo-
sanctimonious” tone in ”The
White Man’s Burden,” and
they wanted none of his civilr
izing mission. Wall quoted
their parody of a verse from
the famous poem:

“We’ve taken up the white
man’s burden
Of ebony and brown.

Now will you kindly tell us,
Rudyard,

How in hell we put it down?"
“Seventy-five years later,”
suggested Wall, ”we’reasking
Richard Nixon the same
thing."

Really, They Can’t All Be Gems

by J. C. Labowitz
I encountered a number of

contrasting, yet stimulating
academic experiences this
week. No. Mr. jones, I did
not finish my paper for Urban
History. Instead, I attended
several of the mind-boggling
array of lectures presented
this past week, given by a
great variety of people that I
felt had much to impart toyour
average Grinnell College stu-
dent. They ranged from Fed
eral Communications Comr
missioner Nicholas johnson
(a native of Iowa City, Iowa,
as the Des Moines Register
would say, and I have no idea
whether he bats right or left)
to Dick Gregory to Prof. Betts
and Dean Wall.

My point of discussion con-
cerning these people is how
valuable their presentations
were to the college commun-
ity, and how we can use them
to further the edutation of the
folks here at the college. To
be blunt, lam concernedabout
the value of speakers brought
to the college (some at great
expense, i.e. $1500 - for
someone like Johnson) versus
the value in utilizing the inr
credible talent here on cam-
pus- native to Grinnell, as it
‘were.

Now, 1 enjoyed both Nick
johnson and Dick Gregory.
They were both entertaining,
excellent speakers/showmen
and both were highly enjoy-
able. But educational, ina true
sense? Were they informative
and stimulating, past in basic
curiosity? I don’t think so.
Mr. Johnson did not come
close to addressing himselfto
what his topic was billed as,
and seemed to have given us
his hip, rightron college aud-
ience lecture. Fun,yes; infor-
mative, marginally; truly
educational, not really.

Mr. Gregory had no specific
topic, and his speech was in
terestingly disjointed. He
proved to be the entertainer of
his billing, working his aud-
ience like the professional he
is. But, besides condemning
the old folks and praising us
kids to the skies, his contri'
bution to thought and intellec-
tual concems at this college
were, again, marginal.

I do not pretend that I did
not enjoy either presentation.
But I enjoyed them as enterr
tainment— a good show, rather
than a vital contribution tomy
education. And aren’t we pay-
ing these gentlemen a lot of

money to be Just entertained?

Dean Wall and Prof. Betts
(whose departure is going to
have profound effects) were
among the contributors to the
symposium on Imperialism
presented this week. I was
impressed with this effort,
largely by the history depart
ment, to attempt a synthesis
of many individuals' talents
in different mediums- film,
lecture, photograph- in differ-
ent areas, such as historyand
psychology. I welcome the op
portunity to come in contact
with the knowledge and intel-
lects of such scholarsas Dean
Wall and Prof. Betts. "timely,
well presented, and a chance
to geta little intellectual stim-
ulation outside the classroom.

I am definitely nOt callingfor
the end of programs thatbring
in outside viewpoints and opin"
ions. These are essential to a
Grinnell liberaleducation, and
programs such as the PPPE
must continue. But multi-me-
dia, multi-discipline seminr
ars such as that on imperial-
ism, that utilize “local [31*
ent” (and I mean all talent
on campus student, faculty,
and administrator, or even
BStG people iftheyhave some
thing to say), are educational
and valuable, and could be
essential to both a Grinnell
and a liberal edutation.

U.S. Rep. john Kyl will be on
tampus April 12 to tour the
science building.

Member colleges of the As-
sociated Colleges of the lVlld’
west and the Great Lakes
College Association have been
lobbying in Washington for
more funds from the National
Science Foundation for under
graduate science education.

Kyl hopes to acquire some
facts here in an effort to get
the schools more science
money.
