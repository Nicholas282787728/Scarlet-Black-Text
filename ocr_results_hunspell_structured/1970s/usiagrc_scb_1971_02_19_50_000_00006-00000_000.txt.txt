Study Shows Grinnell

David Morris, researcher
for the Deans, has made a
study for the R.1<. Mellon
Foundation showing the progr
ress the college has made in
recruiting a quality student
body and faculty in the past
five years.

In those years, the college's
physical assets have risen
from $171/2millionto$24l/2
million, the endowment has
risen from $12 million to
$13 1/3 million, endowment
income has risen from $375,
000 to $685,000, and the total

Examines Senate’s Death Wish

by Alex Karlln

Anyone who has been suffis
centiy bored in the past few
weeks has probably had the
opportunity to glance at the
solemn pages of the s and B
and therein perceived that Gr-
innell student politics is ex*
periencing another of its per-
enniel crisis. It seems our
illustrious Senators have ex- ‘
amined the role of Grinnell
student government (i.e. the
Senate) and unfortunately res
alized that it has no possible
justification. Accordingly they
have revealed their findings
to the campus, arousing the
consternation of the entire
student body. The destruction
of the Senate would wreak un-
imaginable havoc on the lives
of all Grinneilians . . .for
the senate exists as the only
element of comic relief in the
present melodrama of Grin-
nell. I, for one, h0wever,have.
the utmost confidence in our
student leaders and lam thus
assured that this suicide phi
enomena is only a passing
phase perhaps somewhat akin
to a relapse into reailty. If
we examine the causes for this
psychological smte of threa-
tened suicide we usually find
that the sufferer feels he is
unwanted and unloved. The
suicide threats are then a cry
for help, for emotional atten-
tion. Now obviously the sen—
ate realizes that student elec-
tions are only weeks awayand
that it would be nice to have
more than just the candidates
attend the discussion sessions
and/or elections Thus the
senate must ask itself “how'
can we fire up the student
can we fire up the masses
for our elections?” Three ye-

problem but at that critical
point Dan Chefitz rose up and
demanded the abolishment of

the entire farce. Wha ensued:

was a great outburst of para
noiarenthusiasm resulting in
the resounding defeat of the
suicide referendum. Qir pr-
esent senate has learned the

lessons of history well and-

thus we need not fear for the
continued existence of Grins

not to say that the senate.

itself will necessarily remain;
In the past, the student gee
vernment has devoted most of
its engeries toward the re-
organization of student go-
vernment. The argument a1»
ways runs that we must make
the constitution of student goa
vernment as responsive as
possible to the needs, aspi-
rations, and rights of the Gra
innell students. First we dis-
mantle the powers ofthe AWS/
C of HP and empower the
senate . . .then we strength-
en the AWS/C of HP, develop:
the student counselling servi'
ces and weaken the senate.
Viewed in this light the various
new SG'A constitutions, the
GSM, the removal of the hall
system, the extinction of the.
forum split and the Ken Lab-
owitz phenomena can be corr-
ectly seen as the meaningless
machinations of the student
government that they are. At'
any rate we can conclude that
since Loewi and his 100 In-
evitables have nothing else to
do they must begin to draw up
yet another student governmer
nt constitution. Thus the pre*
sent senators can justify their
existence and all aspiring po-

' liticos can have material for

their forthcoming campaign.

Abdolloh ”Likes People Here”

by Barbara Rabyne

What does Bill Abdallah, RA
for East and WestNorris, like
about being at Grinnell? "The
people here. Iwas reallyplea-
sed to find out how versatile
the people are here. They‘re
not only involved in academ-
ics, they’re also musicians,
athletes, and interested in
lots of different things. Ijust
really like the people here.”
After earning his BA as a
Poli Sci major, Bill received
his master's degree in counr
seling and guidance from the
University of Kansas. While

Quality

professors, 40 associate pro-
fessors, l9 assistant profesr
sors and 17 instructors. Now
there are ten more profes~
sors (46), 25 fewer associate
professors, 15 moreassistant
professors and 14 more in-
structors. Sixty-five faculty
members have their door
torate, 34 a masters degree
and 12 a bacmlaureate only.

Faculty salaries have risen
greatly over the past five
years, and have maintained
the same general sanding,
according to the AAUP report
Professors receive an aver
age salary of $18,656 (grade
B); associates, $14,884(grade
B); assistants, $12,850 (grade
A); and instructors, $11,614
(grade AA). The average face
ulty compensation ($14,988)
has risen $3,038 in the five
years.

Eighty— three per cent of en»
tering students last yearwere
in the top fifth of their high
school class, and 68% had
verbal SAT scores above 600.
Comparable figures for five
years ago were 73% and 57%
respectively. Math SAT sco-
res have remained about the

same.
An interesting statistic is

that sixteen fewer students
were graduated last yeareven
though there were 85 more
students enrolled in the coir
lege. This points up the re-
cent rise in the college’s ate
trition rate and the parallel
rise in the size of the fresh—
man class.

Another interesting fact is
that the male-female ratio is
narrowing. Fiftyrthrce per
cent of the enrollment five
years ago was male; that
number is 51% now. This
year’s freshman class is the
first one in whichfemales outs
numbered the males.

there he worked ina veterans‘
administration psychiatric
hospital as a counselor. Bill
was working on his PhD in
counseling when he decided to
take a year off and come to
Grinnell. ”I'm interested in
working with college students
My future plans are to work
in a college counseling center
or community mental health
center. I prefer working with
collegerage people. They're
exciting because they're cons
stantly growing and changing.

“Grinnell is pretty attrac-
tive. At many schools the role
of the RA is more of a dis
ciplinarian. Here is is more
counseling. You don't have to
enforce any ridiculous rules."
“I had a pretty open mind as
to what I would be doing be-
fore I came."

Although Bill is workingwith
Prudence Milite and Dr. Dan-
iels in the mental health cen*
ter as a leader in a therapy
group and helps to interpret
vocational interest tests, his
main interest is the dorm. "I
spend most of my time in the
dorm with the students. I like
that. I spenda lot oftime coun-
seling, talking, and planning
activities, trying to make the
dorm a good place to live."

well as periodic study breaks
are some of the activities. A
course evaluation sheet with
comments aboUt different
courses and professors was
also compiled by the dorm.

“People come to college not
only to grow intellectually but
also personally and psycholo-
gically. It would be good to
involve the professors more
in the residence halls. Iagree
with Rosemary Ash that may-
be some classes could be held
in the dorm lounges and some
of the faculty could have their
offices located in the dorms.
In many ways the resident
hall is the focal point of life
on campus. The RAs are pron
bably the people who loiow the
most about what life outside
the classroom is like for the
students. It ‘would be good for
the faculty to see this, too."
How does Bill feel the coun'
seiing system at Grinnell (an

helpful to have a clinical or
