Review lSD- Chromosome Research

The following is a reprint
from "The Journal of Psych-
edelic Drugs" for September,
1970. The magazine and Other
related publications are on
reserve in Burling.

Following the firSt observa-
tion in 1967 of chromosomal
damage induced by LSDVZS,
the scientific community div—
ided itselfover the validityand
the medical implications of
that observation. The many
issues surroundingthe genetic
effects of LSD, including the
consequences of the drug's use
during pregnancy, have yet to
be resolved. What follows isa
frief review of the major and
more recent developments in
the field that attempts to bring
the issues and data into a
more critical focus.

In 1967, Cohen and his 001*
leagues (7) reported that LSD-
25 caused chromosomal dam~
age to human leukocytes in
Vitro. Shortly afterwards, Ir-
win and Egozcue (20) descri-
bed chromosomal damage in
the leukocytes of LSD users.
Several earlier reports had
shown heredity syndromes exV
hibiting such increased chro-
mosomal aberrations to be
correlated with an increased
incidence of cancer and leur
kemia. This suggested thatthe
use of LSD might similarly
result in an increased inci-
dence of neoplasia and leuker
mia among its users. The pre-
sence of chromosomal aberr
rations in LSDusers ms later
confirmedby several inves-
tigators; negative results have
been reported by others.

The possibility that LSD mi-
ght produce congenital mal-
formations was raisednot only
by the presence of chromoso-
mal breaks in users of the
'drug, but by the presence of
chromosomal aberrations in
some children exposed to the
drug in utero and by reports
,of malformations induced by
LSD in experimental animals.
Since then, the results in ex-
perimental animals have been
questioned by Warkany and

Takacs and by Fabro and
Sieber. Reports of malforma-
tions in humans based on LSD
consumption by the mothers of
two malformed children have
also been questioned, butsuch
reports cannot be ignored.

In spite of some negative re»
ports the weight of evidence
suggests that LSD can and
does produce chromosomal
aberrations in circulating bl-
ood cells. Since the first stun
dies were conducted in indi-
viduals who ingested illicit
LSD, it seemed possible that
impurities in the LSD might
be responsible for the chro-
mosomal breaks. However,
studies in vitro and in vivo
with pure LSD, using human
and mamca mulatta blood
cells, showed that pure LSD
could produce chromosomal
breaks in circulating leuko~
cytes.

Studies in mice indicated that
bone marrow was not affect:
ed, although Cohen and Muk-
herjee reported positive re-
sults. That bone marrow is
probably not affected in hu:
mans is supported bythe findi
ings of Hungerford and his
colleagues who found that the
increase in chromosomal brf
eaks in patients treated with
LSD disappeared in a fewmo:
nths. On the other hand, stu‘
dies in children exposed to
the drug in utero showed that
chromosomal aberrations col
uld be found in circulating
blood cells as late as 2 1/2
years after exposure to the
drug. The preference of LSD
for producing damage in cir-‘
culating blood cells is suppor-
ted by the fact that rhesus
macaques (Macaca mulatta)
treated with LSD did not show
an increase in chromosomal
breaks in other tissues while
chromosome damage in their
circulating leukocytes in'
creased LSD induced breaks
in skin fibroblasts were re-
ported by Abbo and his co~
workers.

ducted only in expérimental
animals, and the results are
far from conclusive.While two
studies found an increase in
chromosomal anomalies in
male mice treated with 25 ml-
crograms per kilogram and l
millogram per kilogram of
LSD, Jagiello and‘ Polani
could not find such anomalies
in male and female mice tr~
eated with doses of the drug
as high as 1 milligram per
kilogram. er own; study in
male mice treated ivith up to
60- micrograms per; kilogram
of LSD was also negative, as
were our studies with mon-
keys (Macaca mulatta) given
weekly doses of 40 micron
grams per kilogram orally
for 4 weeks. The only human
study of LSD and germ cells,
published by Hulten and his
colleagues also reported neg
ative findings.

The capacity of LSD to prO’
duce congenital malforma-
tions has not been well esta-
bli’shed. While Alexander and
co- workers, Auerbach and
Rugowski and Gebér were
able to produce stunted gr-
owth and a number o'f malforr
ma‘tions in mice, rats and
hamsters, negative results
were reported in rats by War-
kany and Takacs, and in rab-
bits by Fabro and Sieber.
The two cases of malforma-
tio'ns described in humans
failed to establish arclear re
lationship between use of the
drug and the production of
malformations’. Jacobson re-
ported brain and skull defects
rarely observed otherwide in
4 of 14 therapeutically abora
ted fetuses of LSD- using mo—
thers, and alluded to a higher
incidence of spontaneous ab-
ortions. However, no one to
date has conclusively proven
that any birth defectjis direct-
ly attributable to parental use
of LSD. 2
Although a large 'umber of
studies have been levoted to
the possible production of
chromosomal aberrations by
LSD, clear- cut ansWers have

Ted Serves For Draft Action

(continued from page 1)
got married to Sarah Forth,
a former Smith student and
also a peace activist.

Ted wrote to,Grinnell studs
ents about his trial experience
with the Flower City Conspir-
acy and his letter appeared in
the January 22, 1971, 8&8.
In the letter he tells why he
believes it is important to
explain the reason behind such
actions to others. Because of
this, Ted and the other de-
fendents decided to represent
themselves at the trial.

Ted says in the letter: "We
must realize both that action
is urgently needed to stop the
war and to begin to remake
society; and that explanation
is needed to those who would
at first be repulsedby whatwe
have done. We must learn to
combine nonrviolent, disrup-
tive, serious activity with a
process of education and
movement building."

”er trial experiences have
convinced us ,that such a
course is very possible and
that such a course offers real
hope for all of us. Carry it
on." When the jury met to
reach a verdict after the week
long trial they recommended
leniency to the judge in sen-
tencing.

Ted is being held in confines
ment in Ashland, Kentucky.
According to his mother, he
has been quite active so far -
taking a correspondence
course from Temple Univer
sity, doing creative writing
and tutoring high school age
inmates. She said for themost
part his spirits have been
good.

Amends Evaluation

Alter an hour and a half of

poorly organized, haphazard
debate, the faculty approved
an experimental instructor
evaluation to be distributed
this spring.

The faculty would not
approve the evaluation until
they had assured themselves
that a panel of faculty experts
in evaluation would be con“
vened to consider the form

The faculty also amendedthe
proposal to ensure that this
semester's evaluation willnot
be used as information innext
year's personnel decisions

An additional stipulation was
that all facultymembers would
be required to distribute the'
form to their classes. Neal
Kausner, professor of philo-
sophy, promptly stated thathe

would not distribute the form.

After this timerconsuming
debate, the hculty finally took
up the subject of reorgnizaa
tion.

Edward Moore, assistant
professor of English, propoa
sed tabling the document on
the grounds that there wasnot
enough time left in the sem-
ester to complete debate on
it, but his motion was sound-
ly defeated.

The only vote taken in the
ensuing debate (less than 40
faculty members remained)
was to retain a clause in the
proposed duties of the Execu~
tive Council that Beryl Clot-
rfelter, chairman of the faculty,
contended duplicated duties of
Lhe Committee on Educational
Policies.

The amending procedure will
continue at next Monday's
meeting.
