Ernie Renaud, director of Grin—
nell’s Campus Mail Service, is the
man most students see each day. He
has lived in Grinnell Since 1936 ex—
cept for a two year hitch in the Navy
in Minnesota, and before assuming
his present post with the College was
employed at a local hardward store.

Ernie plays a dual role. in addition
to directing the campus’s mail oper-
ation, he Serves the Strand Theatre
downtown one night each week as a
reliel operator, and manages the
theatre during the summer months
when its regular manager is on
vacation, Before joining the Strand
in 1950, he held a similarjob with
the Old lowa Theatre.

Each day the college post office is
ﬂooded with literally tons of mail"
in fact, the campus operation is equal
to the US Postal Service Office in

the Grinnell City Post Office to pick
up the first dispatch oi mail, lle p9,
turns at 7:00 for another load and,
with the aid of four student assis-
tants, has the majority of the mail
distributed to student and Iaculty
boxes by 8:00.

Ernie was born in Louiston, Illinois
also the home of poet Edgar Lee
Masters. In fact. it was Ernie’s
grandiather who became citizen kine

Anthology. Ernie and his wife met in

three children, two at Grinnellanda
third in junior high school.

Ernie notes that his personal popu-
larity fluctuates with the volume of
mail students receive. In the sums,
mer, as he lorwards mail to home
addresses, he occasionally adds a
message or two to keep in touch with
students. And when he has time, he
may even place a cheerful note in the
box of some poor forgotten soul who
hasn't gotten a letter in quite a while.

Wright Discusses Block Views

by Steve Crow and John Wylie

In a taped interview with the 55:8
Tuesday evening, CBS President
Lawrence Wright reviewed the
issues which were negotiated with
the administration late last semes-
ter and discussed the attitudes of
CBS towards the agreements and the
manner in which they have been im—
plemented.

Black Admissions

Wright said that the founding of the
Black Admissions Board was “one
of the high points oithe whole semes-
ter.” He felt it was working welland
mentioned that applications from
Black students are up and that more
Black students are being admitted.
He felt the situation was very pro~
mising “as far as the projections
lor our freshman class standings
for Black students for next year.”

Committee Input

Wright noted that, apart trom the
addition of a Black member to the
Freshman Year Committee, "We
have not been getting much input
into the process” He said CBS
was supposed to receive notices of
committee meetings which are re-
lated to the affairs of Black people,
but that nothing has been received
recently. He felt that it was the
administration's responsibility_to
see that notices are sent.

CBS Spokesman

”The administration has a tendency
to appoint a CBS spokesman. They
even do this at meetings where lam
present; they appoint other people
as cos spokesman.” He added that
most at the time this is not a prob-
lem, as long as there are not too
many “black people on this campus
who are anti-CBS or assimilated in
some other way.” Wright indicated
that probably “60 out of 62” Black
students on campus are “active”
CBS members.

As things stand now, there are
usually more Black representatives
at a meeting than there would, be
otherwise - which can lead to a
burden on some Blacks and wasted
manpower.

Black Library

Wright said that he had discussed

the possibilities ol directing the

§B

COLORADO

Former Deputy Secretary of De-
fense David Packard has given Colo-
rado College a gift in stock shares
which amounts to $7.6 million, the
Colorado Catalyst reports. Packard,
whose parents graduated from the
college, owned some $18.8 million
in shares of Hewlett-Packard which
he placed in trust for the period of
his government service. The girl
to Colorado College is of 156,000
of the shares, valued at latest mar»
ket quotations as $7.6 million.

CARLETON
The recent election for president
of the Carleton Student Association
has been contested by the losing
candidate, He contends irregularis
ties in the election procedure Unv
fortunately, the only person em-
powered to act on this matter is

new: of
other
colleges

energies of cos members towards
the establishment of a Black Li-
brary With Head Librarian Henry
Alden. In this way, he noted, there
would be no cost to the College for
the new Black Library. He added
that CBS could get “forty people
over there” anytime they wanted to
in order to complete the work of
establishing the Library.

He indicated that there is a cer—
tain amount of impatience about the
time it has taken to establish a
Black Library. He considers the
figures mentioned by the College lor
establishing the Library (which have
ranged from five to twenty thousand
dollars) as outlandish. He said the
current argument was over two
terms in the agreement - now many
books were to compose the Black
Library and the meaning ofthe term
“near future”.

Academic Review Board

The Black Faculty Review Board
has yet to be established, but Wright
still ieels that it is necessary be-
cause of problems between some
Black students and their professors.
“There are Black people on this
campus right now who are suffering
academic repurcussions from last
semester.” He added that admini~
slration officials had told him that
the issue was a matter of protocol;
that any attempt to legislate specific
grading practices could result in
the loss of Grinnell's accredatlon.

He indicated that, for the time
being, suspected problems would be
called to the attention 01 the Deans,
If the “protocol” method does not
succeed, then he Said Black students
would resort to other methods.

SAGA Option

Lawrence said that the fact that
many Black students eat no more
than 4 meals per week at SAGA and
that 16 Black students were suffer-
ing from ulcers could be documen-
ted. The Black students want a die-
ticlan to study the quality of SAGA
Iood. when the 5&3 pointed outthat a
University of Iowa dietician had
come to Grinnell and done a study on
SAGA, Lawrence noted that no one
from CBS had been contacted to
present Black student complaints.

the newly elected president, because
of an oversight in the student gov-
ernment constitution.

Edson Spenser, an executive vice-
president of Honeywell Corporation
spoke at Carleton college and
delended his company’s policy at
making weapons and chemicals for
military use, He emphasized Honey-
well’s actions in many areas of
social concern, but said that gov»
ernmental policies should be
changed by activities outside of the
corporation -- that is, by politics.

When asked by students if Honey-
well was aware of the uses of CBU
fragmentation bombs manufactured
by the corporation, he said, “No, it
is not our place to find out...“ we
don’t manufacture them, someone
else did."

He indicated that, it about ten
Black students were allowed to get
off the SAGA Board Plan for health
reasons, he would be reasonably
satisfied.

Black Funds

wright noted that there is present»
1y a rift between the Black students
and the administration official who
has controlled their funds. Jo Ann
Bell, a Black sophomore, is serv-
ing as the Black Student Auditor,
doing the bookkeeping and other
tasks associated with administering
funds which are used primarily to
bring speakers to the campus. He
added that Blacks are not always
allowed to gain the perspectives
they desire; that they are told ”you
aren't interested in that”. He
hopes that the available funds can
be used to bring speakers who will
enhance the understanding blacks
have of themselves, and that in the
future the emphasis will not be so
much to educate white students about
black students as it has been in the
past

t Cultural Center

The Black Cultural Center, Wright
felt, could be better utilized as a
Black Research Center. He added
that some structural alterations had
been made to the Center, but that
more were needed. lie was especi»
ally concerned abou the Center’s
heating system, which he said at
times allows temperatures in the
building’s basement study rooms
to reach 40 degrees.

Some Hostile Whites

Lawrence concluded by noting that
there are elements of the White
community at Grinnell which are
extremely hostile to, Blacks For
the most part, however, he saw the
White commlmity as apathetic.

when asked new white students who
wanted to help the Black cause could
get involved, he said: We do feel
they're roles that white students
can play toward making the situation
here at Grinnell or in America in
general as equitable as it should be.

i guess what we are against in the
long run is that we should legislate
a'positlon for you as you legislate a
position for us."

WARTBURG

The following paragraph appeared
in the last issue of the Warlburg
Trumpet:

“No action will be taken on the
proposed grading system (A,B,C, No
Credit) until students have adequate
opportunity to discuss their ques-
tions and express opinions concern-
ing the proposal, according to a
resolution passed Tuesday by the
Educational Policies Committee.

MACALESTER

The Mac Weekly, the paper at
Macalester College, has announced
a new obscenity policy. Thelr mast-
head now carries the slogan ”UnA
necessary obscenity will not be
printed." Last week the paper justi-
iied its policy editorially, observing
that “cussing really looks sn----
in a point Humboldt.“
