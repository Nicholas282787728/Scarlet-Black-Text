(lid. note--The_ tollowing is the
first part of a two—part series on
changes in Grinnell's etforts to
attractnewstudents,

Part it, which will appear next
weelt, will deal with the reactions
of students, laculty, and adminis-
trators to the current recruiting
enorts and the plans for theiuture.)

Faced with a declining admissions
pool, Grinnell's Trustees received
and approved a comprehensive stu»
dent recruitment plan for 1974-75
at its weekend meeting.

The six-page document details the
College's plan to “achieve an appli-
cant pool large enough to assure a
tirstryear class of sufficient quali-

go training in May, and will discuss
the recruiting program with faculty,
students, and administrators.
Members of the School Liason
Committees and Alumni Club presi»
dents will meet on campus in the
fall to discuss their efforts in re-
cruiting new students.
Publications

All those involved in the recruit-
ing program will receive regular
mailings containing admissions ma-
terial as well as campus publica-
tions such as Campus Memo, Scarlet
dt Black, and theractlvities calendar.
A special handbook will also be
published for use in the recruiting
program. The book will contain
information on Grinnell and speci-

will provide publicity for the insti—
tutlon and, if a session is devoted
to high—school students in the field,
would bring potential students to
Grinnell. \
in addition, Departments and Divlv
sions will be encouraged to offer
campus visits for high school stu-
dents for specialized programs in
academic fields, or as generalized
all high school days. ‘

ty and size to serve both academic
and fiscal requirements ofthe col-
lege."

Coordinated by Vice-President for
institutional Development James O.
Avison, the plan is designed to aug-
ment the methods and efforts of
the Office of Admissions.

Categories

Work under the plan is divided
into three categories. The first,
described as “student proﬁle”ln-
volves an analysis ‘of the factors
and characteristics affecting student
interest in Grinnell College. The
second, ”recruitment options", the
valves finding means of identifying
and contacting prospective students.
Promotional Support involves methv
ads of informing prospective stu»
dents about Grinnell College and
projecting the institution to both
prospectives and the general public.

Proﬁle

Under the plan, Associate Dean
of the College James Hamilton will
chair a faculty-administrative come
mitiee which, by analyzing data on

, the current Grinnell student body,
will attempt to determine what aca-
demic, geographic, satin-economic,
and other factors attract students to
Grinnell.

The Committee will also attempt
to isolate factors which haveanega—
tive inﬂuence on both prospective
and current students, and will make
recommendations on capitalizing on
positive factors and minimizing the
negative factors.

Recruiting

Working together, the Alumni and
Admissions Office have developed
a plan for utilizing alumni in re-
cruiting. School Llasou Committees
have been established in key geo-
graphic areas to help identify quali-
fied high school students, to make
personal contact with the prospec-
tives in the area, and to provide
followup support coordinated with
the Admissions Office.

A corps of Alumni Admissions
Representatives, working for a sh»
pend under the Dean of Admissions,
will assist the SchoolLiason Comm-
ittee in contacting students and in

. coordinating recruiting efforts.

These representatives will under-

lies on the admissions and ﬁnancial
aid processes.

Students will also be involved in
the recruiting and support etiorts.
Working through the Office of Ad-
missions, students will assist in
identifying and contacting prospec-
tives in their home towns. Consid-
eration is now being given to pay-
ing students some form of stipendl
for this work.

Faculty

Faculty will also be involved in the
plan. They will contactstudents with
speciﬁc academic interests, and
will write to secondary teachers
whose recommendations were used
in admitting current students.

Departments and divisions will be
encouraged to offer the campus as
a site for state and regional pron
fessional association meetings. This

pared by the OCR, including the
Sharing of Grinnell, the College
Catalog, the Campus Guide, the
Student Handbook, and several pos-
ters.,

Other publications will include the
Freshman Handbook, a student—wri-
tten publication described as having
a “fresh, informal approach”, a
brochure on the Scholar-Athlete at
Griunell, and special brochures on
Grinnell programs like the Fresh»
man Tutorial and the Grinnell-Rush
curricula in the health sciences.l
OCR will also continue its produc»
tion of material for newspapers, and
will increase its output of features
on Grinnell Students for use by
hometown newspapers.

The office will add production of
features about the College prepared
as reproduction proofs for the use
