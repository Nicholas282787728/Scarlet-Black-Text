Telephone directories in major metropolitan areas contain columns oi
gynecologists. But Grinnell has a serious problem, an area directories contain
iew specialists...and, at present, no gynecologists. The problem has occupied
many Grinneu students and administrators ior the past several months,

View Women’s Health /

There appears to be a lot of
interest in gynecological care on
campus as about 50 persons attena
ded a meeting Wednesday night to
discuss what can be done to improve
the gynecological services available
to Women in Grinnell.

The iirst suggestion to emerge
from the discussion was to obtain
feedback on available gynecological
care already existing in the town oi
Grinnell, A number oi complaints
about iaulty treatment provided by
the doctors in town were cited.

To deal with this problem, a
written evaluation of doctor's care
in town could be compiled and made
available to students. It was also
suggested that a student should get
in touch with a doctor if she (or he)
believes that they received a faulty
check-up. They should personally
make a complaint to the doctor,
either through a letter or a
telephone call.

A letter to the local boards
concerning health Services in the
town oi Grinnell was also brought
up as a possibility to improve the
present situation.

Continuing education about them-
selves was generally agreed upon as
a primary responsibility ior all
women. All excellent source ackn-
owledged for learning valuable
information is a book called Our
Bodies, Our Selves, available at the
college book store. Periodical physi»
cal selichecks are extremely valu»
able ior early detection oi problems
such as breast cancer or vaginal
infections.

Two students, Kathy Kramer and
Sally Snapp will soon begin working
on a resource center for women's
information. This will be housed in
the health center,

Women were advised to come
prepared for a visit to a gynecolo-
gist. whether ior a routine exam
ination or for a specific problem.
Reading literature about gynecolos
gical treatment and problems, as
well as discussions with friends or
counselors are important beiore the
visit. It was suggested that when a
woman goes ior a gynecological
examination, she make sure that
certain essentials are taken care of.
These include: taking a medical
history oi herseli and her family.
and getting a breast check and a
Pap test. Women should know what
to expect belore their iirst visit to a
gynecologist to avoid surprise or
apprehension. "Make sure you go
with an awareness oi yourself."
someone remarked.

Finally, the need to set up a
gynecological service ior Grinnell
was emphasized. A proposal to

provide transporation to and set up
block appointments with a gynecos
logist in another town (since there
are none in Grinnell) has been
submitted to the Health Services

Committee.
An open meeting on this proposal

will be held on Friday at 4:15 pm at
Nollen House. People interested in
helping get this proposal through.
and/or in helping to decide on the
choice oi doctor to be made ior
Grinnell women should contact
Diane Ruyffelaere ora Ralph Pom»
erenk.

Grinnell College presently provi~
des a sexuality counseling service.
Counselors will discuss any prob»
lems or questins oi this nature with
students. Included in the group are
Diane Ruyffelaere, Margie Baum-
garten, Katy Puckett and Dennis
Haas. A training program ior
counselors ior next semester is
currently being held.

orneys were at Grinnell strictly in
