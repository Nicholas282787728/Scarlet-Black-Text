I recently had a unique oppor-
tunity to meet with a group ornus-
sian members or a trade and youth
delegation touring the United States.
Ten Americans and about a dozen
of the delegation attended a pri-
vate party in a Georgetown apart.
ment whlch was the tirstiopportun-
lty {or the Russians to meet with
Americans without the presence or
American and Russian "babysit
ters."

Earnest and p04
lite conversation ,e N. ,,
began immediate- plillwmm
ly alter introdujc- plans?
tlons, but the at-
mosphere became
more relaxed after sutl'icient quanr
lilies ol' Michelob beer, California
wine and genuine Russian vodka
were served. Cold cuts and potato
chips, in the ﬁnest American trad-
ition were also passed around.

Apparently Russian youths remain
youths longer than Americans do.

RUSSIANS NOT THE ENEMY

The delegation appeared to be in
their twenties and even early thir-
ties. All were bright, cordial, ir-
iendly, and very able to cope with
some of the difficult questions put
to them, They were prohahly picked
to visit America because of these
qualities.

When asked to compare their po-
litical process with ours, the Rus-
sians said that their party meetings
produce better public ofﬁcials than
our democratic elections Comm-
enting on dissidents and Ukranl’an
nationalists, they remarked that the
vast majority O! the peopleare Imp»
py, but added that “there will al~
ways be a dissatisfied few,” The
immediate concerns or the Russians
were that cars might soon clog the
streets of their cities and pollute
their skies, and that Russian might
note be granted “favored nation”
status by the U.St

The Russians were too polite to
make political hay over Watergate
and other American problems, al-

though we pressed them on some
rather sensitive issues like per—
secution oi Soviet Jewry and So-
viet policy in the Middle East,
Instead, their questions focused on
line in small towns, big cities,
and on college campuses like Grin—
hell.

when I asked one or the Russians,
Aleksandr (one or three Aleksandrs
at the party), his opinion 01 Nixon,
he said smiling, “We love to watch
him. They don't call him Tricky
Dicky tor hauling."

All in all, I loud the Russians
amazingly sincere and human. I
think that they {sit the same way
about us. The party was a lot a!
tun and I earnestly hope thatRus-
siaus and Americans will have many
more opportunities to meet with each
other, peoplevto-people. Perhaps
then we might learn that we are all
only human beings with no reason
to hate, mistrust, and tight with each
otherr '
