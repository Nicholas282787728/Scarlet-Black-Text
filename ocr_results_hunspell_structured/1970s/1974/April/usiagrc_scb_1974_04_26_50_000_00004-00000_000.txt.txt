April 23, 1974

I hat most pleasant time oi year tor all Scarlet a Black editors has ar.

ved ior me .. retirement. This is the last issue of the Scarlet & Black

ith which I will lie involved, iollowing three years oi meeting deadlines
ery week.
ith the decline oi communications this year, our stair has been hard.

. essed. Several individuals deserve tar more credit {or their work over

e past months than they can ever get. ‘
First, Brent Schondelmeyer has done an amazing job as Managing Editor.

e has kept long hours and has produced considerable goodcopy (and

everal deliciously funny essays). His reward has been an appointment

. Editor tor the Scarlet dc Black term beginning in January, 1975.

Kyle Schaub, iollowing her return trom Austria in February, has also
one an amazing amount oi work. She has been paid nothing, and has

till spent hours each week writing, pasting up, and doing whatever else

eeded doing at the moment .- always with cheeriul good humor. She,

.o, has been rewarded with a term as editor’, and her trial period in
bat capacity will begin with next week’s issue. ‘

Louise Dix stepped in as Layout Editor after only aiew weeks at Grin.

ell, and has served us well. l-ler Health ‘Center investigation, co-authored

ith John Tllrnbull, is perhaps the single piece that we can point to when
shed what we have done this year to improve the Grinnellian‘s lot.

Doug Halsey has spent hours in the darkroom and hours more lugging

ameras, working in a salaried management position so ridiculously un.
lerpaid that publication oi the salary here might subject as to an inves—

, ‘onzl Labor Relations Board. As it the photography

asn‘t a lull time task, he has also undertaken several writing assign.

ents and has executed them beautiiully. He is returning ior another
ear in the same job .. dedication which speaks tor itseli.

Dave Calvert has filled the dual role at Sports Editor and Circulation

anag'er. We have disagreed on occasion, usually because at the never

nding battle between Sports Editors and Editors over how much space
. ports will get. He has tilled the sports page, and has malagedto get
,ono copies oi the Scarlet 5. Black in mailboxes on.campus and into
,he ‘0. S. Mail (where many oi them, undoubtedly, are still lost) each

eek. Both jobs are ditiicultand virtually unsalaried, and he has carried
~ t both with eiiiciency and competence.

Others deserving credit are our business staiiers, Laurice Valentine
and Connie Tuck. Lani-ice has keptthe money rolling la (and, untoruinately,
at as» costs keep going up) while Connie has kept our pages iilled with
-eer specials, pub pizza nights, and birthday cake ads.

Dee Dee Goldie has taken on a number oi special assignments, without
pay, and has done them all well. Bruce Green has put together a music
department where there was none.

Two names that are buried deep in the masthead have had a great deal
to ‘do with the success oi this year’s newspaper. Greg Tobin(GT 74)
has drawn cartoons, caricatures, and graphics on short or non-existent
notlce, providing all members oi the campus community with many
chuckles. Peggy Ellis has spent several hours each week translating
hieroglyphics on Want Ad iorms into copy our typesetters could read.
She never got anything for doing the job. but each week her copy was
on time, error iree, and well—read. it you bought a rug or sold a calncra
through these‘ pages, say thanks 'to her .. they are, unlortunatcly, the
only thanks she can ever get.

Thanks are also due to those whose eiiorts in Mlmtezumil apd downtown
Grinaell make the Scarlet and Black possible. Grinnell's oriice oi College
Relations is always ready with an elusive iact, iigure, or photograph on
a moment‘s notice. Marilyn and Betty Ann, our typesetters, have learned
more about the Scarlet a. Black staii through their atrocious typing,
spelling, and handwriting than most mothers know. That they are still
cheeriully setting our copy each week is a tribute to them. John and Jean
Morrissey and Roger Allen oi the Montezuma Republican, Kenny, and
Dave Sutherland at Sutherland Printing all deserve thanks tor the thou.
sands oi ways they have helped this year.

when l began this letter, 1 had planned to spend most oi it discussing
some or the comments directed at me, or at the newspaper, during the
past year. Aiter tilling two pages and most oi a third with well—deserved
thank—yous, I’m no longer in the mood.

Suince to say that no editor enjoys b'eing called brainless, incompetent,
biased, or criminal. No one enjoys treatening telephone calls, anonymous
hate mail, or nocturnal visits aimed at harrassing. No one enjoys threats.

No one enjoys the campus hypocrisy that allows threats against an editor
who devotes a small amount oi space to facts copied irom a police blotter.
but demands that the same editor join in eitorts to cruelty an adminis—
trator or iaeulty member whose actions have displeased.

No one enjoys the cases oi extreme paranoia that iniect some individuals
from time to time as they become convinced that this newspaper is out to
get them.

As I retire, I ask all SCarlet&Bldck readers this..like my predecessors,
my successors in this job will be spending somewhere between so and so
hours per week attempting to put out this newspaper. They are paid next
to nothing ( about 4c per hour) they receive no credit, and they have
minimal training tor their jobs.

They are students, although iew will allow them to be so, and most of
all, they are human beings, Beiore taking pen in handto write aletter
saying what shameless 'ASZE‘W they are, keep that in mind.

I must admit, though, that even these letters added tomyeducation.
My vocabulary has almost doubled in the past year.

Slncerely,
John M. Wylie ll
Editor (retired, thank heaven!)

Cale: Blasts Healih Center

To the Editors:

On Sunday, April 21, around 10
P.M., my weary body iinally suc—
cumbed to a noxious combination of
Saga Grease and hung—overslomach.
In need oi an “anti—nausea pill"
(since Ma's home remedy ot Fepto.
Bismol was not working), imarched
directly to the Health Center only ,
to iind the door locked. The only
way l could have gained admittance
would have been through an RA’s
phone call to the place claiming an
emergency. Consequently, i went
untreated and missed two morning
classes the per‘ day becauselwas
still woozy. Thank you, St. Grinnell
the Benevolent.

All l can say is that I am nnin.
dividual human being in existence
24 hours a day, and my secretary
does not make appointments with
genus and ill humours. For some
odd reason, 1 iind it very hard to
arrange it with reality to become
ill only between the hours of . it.
7:30 P.M. on Sundays. Knowing the
nature ot flesh and bone, i assume
that sooner or later l will find a
need tor a heating pad, or cough
syrup, or whatever, and when that
time comes, chances are it will
not be during the correct hours
one is allowed to be ill on this
campus.

1 also know i paid $45 ior slnlposed
health care and thereiore l ieel
very entitled to whatever services,
however inept, the Health Center
can provide me. I am tired oi wait.

Gay Community:
A Beginning

To the Editors:

We address this letter to the cam--
pus community in general, and to
lts gay mo n' l l in particular.

As you prollubly know, strong ﬁt»
empts have been made this year to
form a viable gay community at,
Grinnell. In many ways, we are
succeeding. For the ﬁrst time, reg:
ular weekly meetings are beingheld
to discuss various aspects of being
gay. Furthermore, we have begun
to deal wlth the need for adequate
gav counseling services at Grinnell,
as well as opening communications
with established gay‘ communities
at other academic institutions in
Iowa, the University at lows in par-
ticular.

We have made a beginning. This
Tuesday, April 30th, at 8:30 P.M.in
Steiner 27, we will be holding an
open meeting to discuss exactly
where WE are, and where we want
to go nan year.

Several ideas have already been
suggested, but we need the input
of as many members of the Campus
community as possible, and espec-
ially of Grinnell's gay men and
women. It you can spare an hour
or so, please attend and share your
ideas with us.

Sincerely,
The Grinnell Gay Community

ing ior SGA and the s d B and all
the other bureaucratic red taped
committees at this kindergartento

issuing this public declaration to
the college community: the next
time i need medical attention when
my obviously anti—social body coll.
apses during an ‘hvlaccepiable" ti.
me, i am simply gollna kick lN that
big glass door and take what is
mine. 1 figure my $45 can go to

spent tor any real health care.

tration insists in levying againstthe
student body, and since the recre-
ant student politicos in the “proper
Channels” won‘t stand up ior them.
selves and all oi us as m ire
adults with rights, I am going to
contend with this rampant authori—
ty in my own way. It it takes a boot
through a door to get a iew changes
started in this concentration campus
to make it a‘more liberal place to
live, so be it. The next time lam
oppressed by the assinine stipu—
lations here, my ioot goes through
the door. Don’t think I’m kidding...

Youno: Demands
Devil Day

To the Editors:

The USs Samba has declared Ap-
ril 30 a national day of Humilia-
tion. Fasting and Prayer. We are
all urged in “humble ourselves as
We see fit before our Creaior, to
acknowledge our ﬁnal dependence
upon Him. and to repent at our na-
tional sins."

The only humiliation I have is that
I live in a country in which agav-
erning body would do something
like this. If ille members of ihe
U. S. Senate Wish to humble them-
selves on April 30, that's gieat.
God knows they have reasonenough.
And if the majority of (he people
in the country wish to do the same,
that's ﬁne. Everyone has the right
to worship when andhawhe Chooses.
But the American gbve rnment should
not lake 3 stand one way orﬂle other
on religion, except to make sule
that everyone continues to have that
right. The wording of the proclam-
ation leaves no room !or people who
don‘t happen to believe in God. Per-
haps the US. Senate doesn’t realize
that there are suchpeople. Or, more
likely, perhaps they do not consider
such people Americans in the ﬁrst
place. '

To signify our distaste for this
action, we have proclaimed April
30 a national (or at least campus-
wide) day of devil-worship. We will
meet outside the post office at 8
PM. (or a torchlight procession
through town, Stopping at each Ch-
urch to Sing Stairway To Heaven.
At midnight we will assemble in
the Florence Lewis library, who
ere, by use of secret spells and
incantations, we will conjure up the
spirit of Everett Dirksen. See you
there. ‘
