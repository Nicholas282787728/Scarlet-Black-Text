Cutler: Ilsr‘aeli Experience

by Fran Cutler

Now that Grinnell is ieeling the
direct ettects oi the energy crisis,
I thought it would be appropriate
to write and till you in on what’s
happening in the oilest part oi the
world. Being in israei has had a
pruiound eiiect on me.

Before the war—
I was merely ens @Ehmmll,

thrailed with the

idea oi being in a W’ERSU‘DEWWE

lureign country. —

Israel is the meeting ground ior
cultural groups throughout the
world e iiassidic Jews, Oriental
Jews,‘Arabs, Christians, - and yet,
one initially has the ieeling other
ing a ioreign element, alien to
the overall Israeli culture. Durr
ing the iirst month oi my stay in

israel, I was still very much in-
volved with America, and searched
the paper daily tor news oi the
latest Watergate disclosure, E55»
entially I was a tourist with a
. /
home--an American in Israel.

However, alter- the war, the atmor
sphere oi the country and my attie
tudes towards it changed radically.
Although i was not iignting the bat»
tles OI the Israeli army in the
streets at Jerusalem, I was made
to feel as ill was a valuable mem-
ber of the war effort,

It was during this crisis atmoSr
phere that the Country put its best
lace forward, overlooked the culr
tural differencesbetweenlsraeliand
American and began to accept us
as fellow Jews. The attachment to
a country or a people usually comes
alter an extended period oltime»-
but the experience oi the war, the
heightened emotions, the common
[ear and sorrow have worked to
accelerate the development of these
feelings,

I don’t mean to infer that all in
israel is patriotism, excitement,
etc, because since the war began
lite in Israel has become even
more ditticult. Government price
subsidies have been lifted on tran-
spomtion, bread, milk, cheese,and
eggs and the cost of these items
has doubled overnight, This is not

be mention the fact that there is
hardly a person in all oi israei
who has not lost a relativeorsomer
one he knew, in the war.

For the ioreign students liie has
changed drastically, but everyone
is too embarassed to complain, be-
cause uur problems are minor in
comparison to those oi the average
israeli iamily, Many oi the pro-
lessors are still in the army 50
classes have been cancelled. Then .
too, 2/3 oi the university is com-
prised of women because 80% of the
college-age men are in uniiorm75%
01 the time.

Also our heat and not water are
turned on only about three days a
week, When things break, there is
no One to (ix them. The universal
excuse is “because oithe situation,"
or “since the war things have Chm
anged." Moreover, the war has
accomplished what I though prer
Viously was an impossible task;
slowing up the world’s Crankiest
bureaucracy. Waiting in line Just
to be sent to another line is a way
at lite here.

Somehow in spite of the general
atmosphere oi sobriety and ten-
sion, I leet a strange attachment
to this place. Maybe it’s because
for the first time I am not part
oi a minority who is expected to
aSSimilate into a protestantsociety.
But there are times when] miss
the “Grinnell Experience.” Forum
dances do not exist in israel and
lsraeli meat makes SAGA Steak
taste like iilet miguon.
