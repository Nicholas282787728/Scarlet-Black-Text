1 am Just a ireshman
and my story’s oiten told,

.i have spent my parents’ money,
For a classroom full of mumblesi
Such are tutorials,

And what a pest,

Still a student does what he wants to do

Then has to do the rest.
mmmm mmmm mrnmrn

When I leit my home and my iamily,

I recall that i was sane,
In the company of strangers

.fn the whirling of the airport terminali

eeling strong,

shoulders back, seeking out the [lner quarters where the educated go,
Seeking out the knowledge only they would know,

Liberal Arts, Liberal Arts, On Liberal Arts,

Liberal Arts, Liberal Arts, Oh Liberal Arts. 0h Liberal Arts

Asking only a king’s ransom,

They came looking tor prospectives,

But i got no otters,

Just a come-on from the ﬁelds of central Iowa

i do declarei

There are times i grit my teeth and say

‘Why the hell did I go there?”
LaLaLaLaLaLaLa

Liberal Arts, Liberal Arts Oh Liberal Arts
Liberal Arts, Liberal Arts 0h Liberal Arts Oh Liberal Arts

Now rm puttin on my winter clothes and wishing l was gone7

Where the New York SUNY pressures aren’t squeezing me—

Squeezing me—going home.

In the cornﬁeld lies a student

and raving we attract a lot of at-
tention to whatever we are doing ”

“That sounds logical,” said
lrving.

“lrving, please don’t use that
word around here. It violates all 0i
our principles.”

“l'm terribly sorry . . ,Tell me,
what changes have you brought
about here at Grinnell?"
“Hmmm. Oh yes, we‘ve painted a
couple of trees, and have had a sit-
in or two.”

“Did your actions bring about
any permanent improvements?”
queried Irving,

“lrving, you don‘t realize what
you are saying, Making a per-
manent change in the system
requires commitment and worst of
all—rational thoughtl We avoid
that at all costsl Besides, pers
manent changes take too much
energy to enact!”

“Mr. Raspen, what is your
opinion of SGA’.’ And would you
ever consider working 'wilh
them'l"

“The Sleeping Giants’
Association? Why the hell would
we want to work with them?"

“Well, I thought maybe you
could try to get voting, student
members on the Board oi Trustees,

and to lobby for student voting
rights in Faculty meetings, or at
leastto getstudents to show up and
voice their Concerns,” proposed
Irving,

“That kind of action would
require workl Are you some sort oi
capitalist pig?"

“No, really. i just thought l
would suggest something that
would have a far-reaching im-
pact."

“Irving, that takes time. n we
don’t like something we just write
a nasty, impassioned letter and
then iorget about the issue.
Emotion is everything!"

“Mr. Raspen. is it true that your
‘group‘ does not react well to
questions and criticisms?”

“That’s a dirty lie‘ We welcome
questions and criticisms, but not
judgments and answers," R. n.
declared.

“Forgive me, but don’t
criticisms and judgments mean
the same thing?"

“Irving, you keep forgetting to
look at things emotionally,” ade
monished R. R.

"I think l
Raspen.”

“0h, lrving, will you never
learn? ll”
