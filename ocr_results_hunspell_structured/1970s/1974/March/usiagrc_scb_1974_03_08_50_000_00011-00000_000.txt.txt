hy Rich Arnold

The also-rans of the IM basket»
ball league had a banner week as
they stuck it to some of the big-
stuffs.- Gates won its first game
of the season and Ilaines ran up
a two—game winning streak before
reverting back to their old farm.
Read also broke out of their 517
ump. As we head into the stretch,
Loose looks to be the South Divi~
sion champion and Dibble/Cowles
and Langan/Smith will be playing
for the championship of the North.
Playoff time is rapidly approaching
so place your bets and get ready
to crown a champion.

In the North Division 3 revived .

Merley totaled 35 points in the two
D/C victories. Bob Arnold’s Z4 poi

over a laltering Main/Mears team,
61-37. Norris, back from the gr-
ave, upset Corleader Langan/Sml-

off the pace set by D/C. L/S later

reasserting their desire to succeed
and finding reinforcement in the vic-
tory. Isn’t that sublime!

Wrapping up the South Division ac-
tion we rind that Loose is staying
just that. They wontwomoregames,
increasing their win streak to B.
Read was upended by Loose, 4329,
and Main/Mears was sheddingtears
after Loose beat them, 63753. Jeff
Fallon and John Williams, the Loose
dynamic duo, scored 22 and 21 poi-
nts respectively in the win over

Off Campus visited the PEC long

Mike Harris' 20 points, Readbested
Gates in overtime, 39-38, finally
bringing to a close their 7 game
Winless streak. The Profs, behind
Mo Hunt’s 25 points, showed grad
school is good-tor something by
demolishing Norris, despite Tony
Russell's 23 points.

And then there was Haines! The
Profs and Main/Mears both fell vic-
tim to the Halnes lads and lassies,

36~32 and 37-35 respectively. It took
a team that sunk to the level of
Halnes to beat them, and that team
was Gates, After 9 straight losses
Gates finally tasted the sweet nec»
tar of Victory in a 32—27 squeaker
over Haines. Haines’ Tom Paltzer
tallied 32 points in their three
games.

over the weekend, ending the sea-

the long and discouraging season
came at the hands of Carleton and
St. Olaf, and neither contest was
close.

commanding 3M advantage. By ha-
lftime it was 46-20, and it ended
89-68, favor of the hometowners.
With current leading scorer Paul
Delaney inhibited by a persistentflu,
the scoring chores fell increasingly
upon Bruce Johnson, Chip Hall, and
Craig zippc. lnthc Carletoncontest,
with Delaney held to 9, Johnson and

A Saturday afternoon tilt Crosstown
at St. Olaf saw the Pioneers, down

The ailing Delaney was forced to
shower and dress at halftime, fur~
ther weakening a team which had
already lost its two leading scorers
a week earlier. Johnson and Hall
led the Grinnelllans with 16 aple»

career game, tallied 6. The high—

n't expected to place, dropped his
time in them fly to take ele-
venth. Rowat, after swimming at
strong l:08.l breaststroke leg in
the 400 medley relay, took sixth
in the 200 free, 3rd in the 100 back-
stroke, and second in the 100 but
terlly. Btesh and Weidling came
through with sixth and ninth place
finishes in the 50 free; Weldling
and Reed were 10th and sixth res»
pectively in the 100 free. Huntoon
was the miracle man of the meet.
A failed dive that put him in last
at the end of the first day didn’t
greatly upset him. He hit all of
his dives well in the second day,
going from 12th to third, His per
formance almost overshadowed that
of the ecstatic Du Bois, who in his
first year of competition, won the
drying.

Grinnell was the star of the meet,
defeating nine other schools in a
round robin singing contest. Led by
star minstrels Jetf Read and Bob
Winters, Grinnell’s glee clubledthe
audience in rounds of songs in-

cluding “she was a virgin in her
freshman year” and “shine on har»
vest moon" and show tunes, in-
cluding “Funny Girl,” ”’l‘helrnpos—
sible Dream,” and “In the Mood.”

The Grlnnell College swimm-
ing team would like to express
its sincere wishes for a speedy
recovery for Mrs. Rachel Ober-
miller, wife of swim coach Ray
Obern'liller.

Icemen Lose, Nobly

by Dave TenEka

DES MOINES, lite—Saturday night
the Grinnell Ice Hockey Club jour-
neyed to Des Molhes ice Arena
to lake on the Graceland ice jocks.
The result was a fast paced, well
fought, and totally exhausting 11-3
loss for the Pioneers.

Playing with little practice the
Grinnell offense stayed with Grace
land through most of the first period.
Freshman Mark Dickinson scored
his ﬁrst goal of the game unass»
isted on a breakaway to tie the Sc-
ore lrl. Soon afterwards another
freshman, Mark Schwartz chucked
little Peter Puck home with the
assistance of Al "Fire Up" Frey
and Don Aldrich. After that, Cir—
aceland ran away with the score,
despite the hard checking of the
Pioneers and the displays of Coach
Rick Jelinek and the dedicated Gr—
innell tans,

A spirited on Squad, headed by
Dave Calvert, managed to provoke
a minor fight with some of the more
obnoxious Graceland frat men. Not—
hing serious, but the Grinnellians
did put on a flne Show. Jelinek,
for his part, was dressed {it to
kill, in a fine wool tweed suit,
lapel ﬂower, and 50-cent cigars.
Dickinson and Frey teed Off for
the hardest hits of the game Frey,
at one point, made an attempt to
imbed a Graceland head into the
boards. Dickinson brought several

GRINNELL

men to the ice on his way to am-
assing over six minutes in penal.
ties.

Dickinson slapped in his second
goal late in the game, with Schwa-
rtz and Frey getting the assists.
Shortly afterwards, tempers ﬂared
again, this time on the ice. Winger
Dave TenEka, after being jabbed
with a stick in the face, retaliated.
When the melee ended, TenEyck
and a Graceland player found them-
selves in the penalty box, serving
double minors for fighting.

The defense had its bad spots,
but also sparkled at times. Steve
Larrick, putting in his first per—
formance ever as goalie, kicked
out an incredible 49 shots. Andre
Sodoma, the team’s secret wea»
pan from Montreal, played a tough
game, as did Dave Greene. The
breath taking play or Lee Lasky,
Greene, Aldrich, and Barclay Sch-
ultz stopped several breakaways
to aid Larrick. Bob Curley played
a steady game at wing, along with
Jay MacAfee, who got every face-
ofl he was in.

This Saturday night the die herds
will once again try for their first
win in over three seasons. They’ll
be looking for some fans to come
down and witness the squad in ac-
tion. It all starts at 10:15 P.M.
in the spacious Des Moines ice
Arena, and it is free. Bring your
own brew and get into it.
