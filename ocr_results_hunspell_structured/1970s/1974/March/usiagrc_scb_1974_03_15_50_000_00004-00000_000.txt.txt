Welcome To The

New Times

We returned from “putting the Scarlet and Black to bed" at the
printer‘s last Thursday to find a new campus publicationiin our

boxes.

A group of concerned people have brought out the New Times.
1 Volume ’1, Number 1 was a founpage, typed sheet containing

only a few articles.

But, the New Times is covering areas that are neglected by all
other Grinnell publications They are looking at the Grinnell
Experience, and the outside world, from a viewpoint that has
not been available in print heretofore.

The New Times has a problem, though. They have very little

money. The paper is not supported by any existing campus
organization, and its organizers give no indication that they

would welcome such support.

They also wish to distribute the newspaper free of charge to
anyone who wants it. and they do not want to accept paid

advertising.

This leaves donations as their only source of funds.
The New Times serves a definite purpose at Griunell College,
and we welcome it. We hope you will welcome it. too, by giving

it financial support.

Jack Doppelt complained earlier this year that the Scarlet and
Black is “the only game in town." The New Times offers a
remedy for this situation. and it is a remedy we hope will
remain at Grinnell long after we, as individuals, have moved on.

Kramer: lauds Outgoing SGA leaders'

To the Editors:

From the random evaluations Of
the 1973*745GA Lhatlhave heard,
I have become increasingly dis-
turbed with the politimlattitudes
of the Grinnell community. The
charge of elitism has beenlevelr
ed at the SGA leaders. Students
complain that the SGA did not
"give them" anything this year.
Some felt that the leaders were
too concerned with faculty and
administration issues and not
with student desires,

in times of crisis the people in
positions of responsibility turn
to individuals who have Commi
ed themselves to solvmg a s
nation. Although a group mayap-
pear ingrown, it only takes a
willingness to make that commit-

The racial problems bnthebas-
ketball ball club started on the
trip to C06 and Beloit. Bailey
(Bill) would say how much better
the Black players were. chould
say how bad the white guys on
'the team were. Every road trip
was like this. Bailey would tear
apart myself, Chip Hall, Craig
Zippe, among others. Bailey said
[0 me, “The only reason you’re
on the team is because you're
white. If you were Black wtth
your ability you'd be off the
team. You got the complexion
with the connection for the pres
tection; you got the connection."

Bailey has also said‘ lo the,
“You have no shot, you can't
jump, you play poor defense,
'you're slow. In practice I like it
when I havetoguardyou becausel
mn r951."

Bailey said, "The startinglinc-
up should be Moss, myself, Rico
Williams, Noble Young,andsome
other white ball player to help.”

In practice one day Moss. WIII’
iams, and Bailey decided to play
blood ball. They were on the
a team with 2 white bullplayers.
Idon't remember who thny were.

They played against Tim Havens,
Dave Wopat, Torn Grauman, cir-
ier Ncwmn, and myself. Moss,
Williams, and Bailey fouled the

long hours for issues they had
been elected to solve. There
were tangible results. The Facr
ulty Evaluation Handbook, the Ad
Hoc Committee on Health Ser-
Vices, the Convocation on Liberal

food service have all been highly
successful. The 4*I’3 Calendar
and the Credit-No-Ctedit option
are in favorable positions in cams

fought on the Communications
Department, the Wall Committee,
and the over-all issue of student
governance. These defeats reprr
esent an important attitude taken

was hooking my other arm. The
next day at practice they started
again. One time on a rebound I
was awarded an elbow to the head
from Hailey which broke mygla-
sses, opened a quarter inch gash
above my left eye'and left me
dizzy for the next day. If Iwas
mad at somebody I would pron
bably throw clbows too. But if

‘I caught him in the in the nose

about it and apologize for break

one word. In fact, the next time

by our student leaders. They de-
sired more for the contentment
of the Grinnell student than just
a pet policy or security patrol.

Facing an increasingly conserr
.vative administration and faculty,
they tried to create an atmos-
phere where student academic
desires Would be Viewed res-
pectably. With the establishment
of the committee governance sys

tem, the student receive the res-
ponsibility for many actions as
peciany the social concerns while
the power for the worthwhile
growth and change remained in
the hands of the faculty and
administration. The only way to
ever hope to have the goal of
student / faculty /administration
governance realized is with con.

Bailey didn‘t show up for the
Coe game. Williams didn't show
up for the Cornell game and 2
practices and when he showed
up for the next gamc, he played.
In the locker room after the
game against Eeloit, Chip and
Rico were havinga hcatcd argur

Rico and walked away. I was
laughing at the incident.

Rico then yelled,‘“Blanchard,
what are you snickerihg at."
Isaid, “This is somcfczim.'l'hc
attitude on this team is Worlh'

Rico said, "You ain't a ball'
player anyway. The ballplayers
are the guys who go on the court
and do rife job."

I yelled, "That’s right, Rico,
you said it right there. ‘\hd (lo

Rico started yelling ihcnlicrem
tly, and Idccldcd to Ignore him.
While I was in the shower I
heard yelling. I was told that
Bailey had told Zippc to “come

to talk to the, Bill, you can conic

Bailey then startcd yelling and
whipped his shoe Ell Zippc. It

defeats along the way will be
frustrating but eventually thead'

interest in our academic future.
The SGA leadership should be
commended for their per-
formance in 1973774. They were
productive even though theyfaced
an unresponsive administration,
an unsupportive student body,

and a powerless posuion.

and Rico and Moss were in the
back. Moss and Rico decided to
take the bags out between the
two seats, lie the seat down, and
stretch out. When they finished
stuffing bags for pillows, they
threw the extra bags on our
seat. Kellar pushed the hagsback
and Moss started yelling at Kel’
lar and Moss pushed the bags
back to Kellar. Kellat put the
bags in the back at which point
Moss started after Kellar and
pinned him to the front seat.
When Zippe and Itried to break
it up I got clubbed on the head
by Rico and Zippe was stopped
by Bailey.

One day Moss and Bailey came
late to practice. Bowers took
them in the brick room to talk.
Words were shouted and Bowers
kicked Bailey and Moss off Ihe
team. I heard Moss ycll, “I'm

0n:.Supporls Can Ban

To the Editors:

I would like to thank all 01 those
Grinnellians who wrote to me ask»
ing for my support for legislation
to. ban the use at disposable bever—
age containers.

As a strong supporter ofmeasures
to ban the sale of such containers,
I have co-sponsored Senate File
1085, a bill to ban the use of dis—
posable containers and to regulate
other beverage containers through

the imposition of a ten cent refund—
able deposit.

The bill has been assigned to the
Senate Natural Resources Commi»
[tee and should be coming up in the
subcommittee within two weeks.

' Members of tile suh - committee

to which Senate File 1035
has been assigned included Senator
Dale Tieden, Senator Charles Mil-
ler and Senator William Winkleman.
Some of your correspondenceurged
me to support House File 317, a
bill now in committee in the House.
House File 317 takes a different
approach by regulating the use at
both disposable and non-disposable
beverage containers through theuse
of refunds. It does not prohibit dis—
posable beverage containers, as
Senate File 1085 does.
Again, thank you for your concern.
Sincerely,
Joan Orr

Finkelman: AniwersWoods

To the Editors:

I am one of, if not the dummy
that J.C. Woods refers to in
iasI week's "Bread and Beans
and Things". I would like to
clarify the events that took place
that Friday night. Iwas walking
down the loggia when I ran into
3 LC. Woods Who's face told the
story of his pain. Wishing Sum?
way to communitzte my feelings
With this man I said that I had
enjoyed the column that he had
written. I did not say “Damned
good column" or "great editor—
ial", I said that Icnjoyed the
column. Digging into my Pocket
Webster dictionary I find that I
did say What I wanted to say. if
not a little obscurely, because
along with meaning deriving pie»
asure from something enjoy also
means deriving benefit from
something.

I benefited from your column
Mr. Woods, even though I did not
"like" it. As a ﬁnal word, for
those of us who enjoyed (in my
use of the Word) Mr. Woods’
column, his final comments of
March 8th’s column only half
apply, whereas Mr. Woods in-
sists that we are "fucked up"
and “being fucked over" I we-
uld say that we are definitely
being “fucked over", but are not
yet "fucked up".

nine invited groups and four lo-
izil groups to perform, Grinnell
College Game to the aid of the
