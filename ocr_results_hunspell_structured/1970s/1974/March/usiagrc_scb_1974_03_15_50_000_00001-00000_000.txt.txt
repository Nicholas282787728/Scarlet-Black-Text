VOLUME 82, NUMBER 21

. Demos Caucus Here Monday-

Grinnell's First Ward Democrats
caucused Monday evening, elected
delegates to next month’s county
convention, and adopted several re-
solutions, including one calling tor
the impeachment of Richard Nixon.

Democrats throughout the state
caucused in 2,636 precincts Mon-
day in the first stage oia process
that will culminate in the state con-
vention later this year. Since this
is not a presidential year, the Cau~
ouses organized hy gubernatorial
candidate preference.

However, as was the case Slater
wide, there was little inclination
locally to make a commitment to
any of the three announced candle
dates tor the Democratic nomina—
tion and the caucus selected an un-
committed slate of is delegates and
accompanying alternates to the co-
unty convention to be held in Monte»
zuma April 6.
in addition to the resolution onim-
peachment, the caucus voted in la-
vor of a statement saying that those
who resisted the dralt or the mili-
tary be presumed to have done so

in opposition to the Indochina war,
and that unconditional amnesty be
given to all those who resisted ior
that reason.

Several resolutions dealing with
the rights oi women were also
adopted. They included Oppositionto
discrimination in housing, retire-
ment benetits, and insurance rates,
and a call ior a change in court
procedures in cases of rape.

Note was made at the greater par-
ticipation in the party structure,and
the caucus resolved to continue
ettorts to assure women and other
groups equal participation in the
future. Resolutions in lavor of lim-‘
iting campaign length and campaign
spending, and supportingthe concept
at party endorsement oi candidates
in the primaries [or a tour year
trial period were also adopted.

Twenty persons attended the cau-
cits, a relatively large turnout tor
an oil-year. Those attending re-
ﬂected the presence in the pre-
cinct oi the college dorms, most
oilecampus housing, and the resir
dences of several laculty members.

Misery

They say misery loves come
pany, but in the Scarlet and
Black misery has a desk with
a nameplate on it.

If this issue looks somewhat
"unusual," blame the typeset
ting machines .. which died at
midweek. Alternate equip»
ment was used to set much of
this issue.
