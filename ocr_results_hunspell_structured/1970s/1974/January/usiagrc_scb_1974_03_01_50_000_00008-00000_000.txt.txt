Scots, Siwush

by Dave Calvert

Grinnell took a giant step lést
,week towards cliniching the Cellar
'position in the Midwest Athletic
Conference basketball final stand-
ings by dropping three contests,
two of them at home. in Friday and
Saturday night Darby Gymnasium
match-ups the Pioneers were out-
lasted ‘by Monmouth, 76763, and
hopelessly outclassed by Knox, 91-
60. Monday’s road tilt at Monmouth,
ll. saw the Pioneers discarded 83-
53. The three set-backs droppedthe
Pioneers to 1-11, and 4713 overall,
with only two games remaining.

Friday night a short and decim—
ated, but spirited and hustling band
of Pioneers gave Monmouth a scare
in the first half, which ﬁnished with
the heavily favored righting Scots
leading by only 32730. Lacking, es
pecially, scoring leaders Dennis
Moss and Bill Bailey, both ot whom
had been thrown off the team by
Coach Edd Bowers, the Pioneers
looked more to freshman Paul De»
laney and junior Chip Hall for sc-
oring punch. Hall and Jim Casey
rebounded and shot well, gathering
in 10 first halt bounds and 15 poir
nts between them, A tight team de-
fense forced the Scots to a half»
time shooting percentage of only
36%. Over the same period Grinnell
shot44%.

,IM B-ball: Week 0f Upsets

by Rich Arnold

, A week of upsets is an accurate
description of the third week of in-
tramural basketball action. Both
Dibble/Cowles and Langan/Smi-
th were knocked from the ranks of
the undefeated (the last teams to be
so rudely treated) and a strong
Norris team kind of fizzled out
as they dropped three games, all
against strong competition. But the
big news of the week -was the first
Victory for the Haines squad, Hai-
nes, a team made up of coeds and
coedies, easily handled a putrid
Cleveland/James team, 35-17. Ha»
lines feels good all over!

Loose tied up D/C’s Wayne Wiley,
holding him to just 5 points as they
edged D/C,38—30.John Williams and
Jeffl Fallon paced the Loose squad.
Loose also crushed Haines, 40~26,
to stay on top of the South Division
standings. on Campus ‘remained a
game behind Loose by virtue of an

poured in 29 points in the win over
Norris. Main/Mears succumbed to
their own ineptness and the exces-
sive bulk of the Profs, losing by
ten, 58-48, Later in the week M/M
upset the faltering Norris team,
48-39. behind DavidConrad’s spark-
ling 19 point performance. ThePrr

week!

Clark, enjoying the results of the
return of the celebrated JohnHaigh,
easily handled previously undefeated
Langan/Smith, 46-27, and edged a
determined bunch ‘of Profs, 51-46.

Women Whip Knox

GALESBURG, lids-Lucie McMillan
swept three events and Anne Graham
swiped two more as the Grinnell we»

_men’s swim team broke into the
win column, 65-55, Saturday. Also
winning events for the Pioneers were
Jill Hoover, Marg Horstman, and the
ZOO-medley relay team, composed of
Susan Nelson, Nancy Judd, Hoover,
and Pam Wilk. It Was the last 1974
meet for the women, who closed
the season with a 173 record.

Saturday’s meet pitted the Pion-

against a school of equal size. The
Knox team is in its first year of
competition, while the Grinnell wo-
men began a year ago,

The Pioneers secured first place
finishes in nine of the 14 events.
The first bout of the afternoon, the
zoo-medley relay, gave Grinnell an
early lead.

Although Knox's fine swimmer,
Sue Benn, grabbed firsts irom Gail
Machala in the lOO—individual med-
ley and lOOrbreast, Grinnell never

lost the lead. After Peggy Ellis
took a second in the ZOO-free, Gra-
ham turned in a 39.5 ESQ-back, good
for first.

Hoover iollowed with a tirst place
39,1 507breast, after which Horst-
man claimed a first for her 29,2
50-free.

At this point, triple winner McMil-
lan took over. Her SD-ﬂy, loorfly,
and 400-free efforts put the Pion-
eers over the top. Graham’s 1:28
loorback also placed first. Impor—
tant seconds were also logged by
Bonnie Kenney, Horstman, and H00-
ver in the lOOrback, lOOrfree, and
diving events,

Seniors McMillan and Graham have
now Competed in their last Grin-
nell meet, but the squad already
looks good for next year.

Coach Jean King anticipates two
meets with Knox next year, and is
looking for other schools of come
