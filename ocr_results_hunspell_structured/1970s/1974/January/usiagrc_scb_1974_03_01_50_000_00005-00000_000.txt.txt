Pursell :lurn to Christ

To the Editors:

I ieel that the letter of the three
exeGrinnellians demands a reply
because I can not accept their state»
ment that the purpose of higher
education (Whether or not it is at
Grinneil) should be to provide me—
aning (or liie However, I can sym-
pathize with their reelings because
through my treshman year at Grinr
hell, I held similar beliels and was
similarly disillusioned with Grin—
nell, ‘

Unlike these students, I came to
the conclusion that the problem was
not with Grinnell but with all higher
education. For some purposes (for
mal and iniormal acquisition or
knowledge, breaking awaytrom pare
ental control, vocational training,
etc.) college is great. But, there
is nothing in education per se which
can develope in a person those val-
ues which give lile meaning. Intact,
the seemingly meaningless strain
which Grinnell applies to its stur
dents can rapidly accelerate theloss
of those Values which one thought
he had.

This does notmeanliieis hopeless,
just that we have been looking ior
purpose in the wrong place, In the
tall or my sophmore year, I came
to the conclusion thatliiewas mean-
ingless, but i wouldn’t give up se—
arching in the hope that in some
unexplored area I would find a
purpose {or living. At this point
some friends helped me to dis:
cover Jesus Christ and to accept
Him as my Lord and Savior.

Since that turning point in my
lite 2 l[2 years ago, my iaith in
Jesus Christ has led me to a grow
ing understanding or the meaning
which my lite can have. So mymes-
sage to the ex-Gr'uinelllans is to
stop searching (or meaning wherelt
can‘t be found, and look to Jesus to
give your lite purpose,

Machliger: 100 Days Parly Remembered

To the Editors.

This goes to everyone who attended
and burned out at the seniors "100
Days Party" last week. Many oiyou
were curious as to why it was held
at the Eagle's Lodge. This letter is
to clarity a low things and comment
in general.

I first tried to rent the Horn. Mr.
Parmley inlormed me that he was not
interested in renting to us. Mr. Dome
inoil, DI the office of College Relar
tions, tried to intercede; Parmley
“almost came around” but his night
start tinally vetoed the possibility.
He still has negative ieelings over
last semesters boycott and reels a
decrease in business because ulour
Pub. One of his waitresses told me,
“The students have to realize that
they can’t run this town.” The 4H
Club Qucnset Hut, the next place
tried, does not rent to outside gr-
oups anymore. The Pub is toosmall,
and the desire was to hold it Oil
campus. Quad and Cowles were un—
der consideration for perhaps 10
minutes, the idea discarded when it
was intimated we’d have to literally
lick the floors clean alter the party
to restore it to its newly waxed and
sealed condition.

The Eagles Lodge worked outidea-

lly. Many thanks to Mr. Deminatt
tor ﬁnding it; we were really get
ting trantic. The party came of!
incredibly well; many say it was
one oi the best in 4 years. It makes
me Ieel it was almost worth all the

, aggravation to pull it all (but not

quite),

The only complaint I still have is
protts, Where were you? it is trad~
itional for the raculty to join sen-
iors at this party; perhaps 4 came.
president Leggett, where were you?
We counted 3 administrationpeople.
Many seniors reel strongly annoyed
that so low faculty showed;youwere
all invited!

Anyhow . its over, it was a huge
success, and good luck in muddling
through the great bureaucratic tr»
eadmill to anyone thinking oi doing
a 50 Days party. Thanks to Demin-
elf, Ralph Pomerank, Dale Hawn
(with reservations), and SagaDave.
More thanks to KDIC, especially ltae
ren and Jeff; you folks gaveusaline
show. And to the guys at the door,
general helps, and Darryl Keenan,
Mr. boo soundman.

Only 99 days to go . tire up!

To the Editors:

I am writing this letter in rose
ponse to the slanderous and sour-
rilous remarks detaining my jour»
nalistic abilities and striking at my
moral ﬁber printed in a letter to

the editor last week. The two “uni

biased observers” who claimed or-
edit for the letter are, in my un-
biased opinion, mildly deranged,

Anyone who has nothing better to
do than "anxiously await” the next
lm basketball article (No matter
how cleverly written they may be!)
is lacking something in the old
noggin.

The two writers intimated that
Main/Mears could beat Clark re»
gardless or John Haigh’s contribu-
tion or lack of such. Balderdash!’

A nineepcint lead is not“whopping”
in any sense or the word and conSr
idering Mr. Haigh‘s scoring average
prior to the Main/Mears game was
almost torty points per gamel doubt
very much it the outcome would be

the same it the gamewerereplayed.
As {or my alleged nicknames i can
only say that the two dinks were
writing with their heads up each
other’s canal. ‘Their minds (and
bodies) are in the gutter, but mine
are not. Their perverted minds
simply twisted what I am really kn»
own as: Beautiful.

In conclusion, just let me say
that the two asinine authors wou-
ld make excellent paper boys them-
selves. If they could coordinate th-
eir motions long enough to get their
legs moving‘ in the same direction
they would be perfect tor the job
because delivering papers requires
practically no intellectual abilities;
a “quality” they most certainly
possess.

Truth always,

Stray Dog (MC6667I) is the filth
and latest release on Emerson, La-
ke, and Palmer’s new label, Manti-
core. A threerman rock group,pos-
sesslng both British and American
roots and influences, Stray Dog has
assembled a promising but uneven
debut album.

The hand was formed in 1973, The
members are shutiy Walden on lead
guitar, Al Roberts on bass and key-
boards, and Les Sampson ondrums.
Walden and Roberts played together
in the United States as a bandknown
as “Aphrodite," During a visit to
England in late 1972, they met
Sampson, who was drumming {or
Noel Reading’s “Road." Alter Road
split, Walden, Robens,andSampson
decided to lorm their own group.
They recently toured the U.S. with
Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. Snui'Iy
Walden has also played on albums
by Free (Heartbreaker) and Pete
Sintield (Still).

Greg Lake produced the opening
cut at the album, a Walden/Roberts
composition entitled “Tramp (How
it is)" This is one OI the best
cuts on the album, and it empha»
sizes the band’s American and Bri-
tish influences It opens with a Wa-
kemanish organand synthesizersolo
but breaks into a hard rocker. The
production is decidedly British--a
kind of spacey, crisp sound, Lyrics
such as "Baby, rm just a Texas
boy” demonstrate the American Iar
cet oi the song’s dual nature. Wal-

den’s lead guitar is excellent, the
drumming is competent, but the
bass guitar is just barely medio»
cre.

”Crazy,” another line cut, seems
to have Free and Tempest inﬂu-
ences.

An attempt at diversity ends in
disaster with “A Letter,” a soft
song with somewhat trite lyrics.
This is followed by “Chevrolet,"
a Billy Gibbons composition. It is
periormed well, but adds nothing
to 2.2. Top's originalversion on
their Rio Grande Mud L.P.

Side two opens with “Speak of
the Devil." Greg Lake not only
produced this one, but seems to
have inﬂuenced the lyrics as well.
The meter is rather similar to that
on “Karn Evil 9 (lst impression)”
on ELP’S Brain Salad Surgery. Wh~
ile this is not a bad cut, it has not—
hing special that would save it from
mediocrity.

“Slave” appears to have beenhea-
vily inﬂuenced by Jon Hiseman's
Tempest on Stan Webb and Chicken
Shack, and is one of the album’s
better songs. Walden is really good
at playing guitar while he sings,and
Sampson’s drumming is superior.

0n the basis of their first album,
Stray Dog havenotshownthemselves
to be particularly creaﬁveorinven-
tive. Neither is their music HSub-
tle." But it you’re one of those
people who hate the Grateful Dead
because of their so~called subtlety,
then perhaps you’ll like stray Dog.
