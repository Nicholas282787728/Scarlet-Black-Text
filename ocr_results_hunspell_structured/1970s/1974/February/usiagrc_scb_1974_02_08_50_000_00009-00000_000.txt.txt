Chicago was the site of the big
gest Grinnell basketball triumph
in many a year. Coach Edd Bowers’
cagers won the University or Chie
cago tournament, beating Knox and
Colorado colleges. Standouts in the
short to improve last season’s 2-
I? mark have been Bill Bailey and
Dennis Moss, The latter played an
excellent game against Coe this
past Monday in Darby Gym... Look
for the MAC swim title March land
2 at Blackhawk Junior College in
Moline, lll. Strong performances by
Bob Winters, Tom Bowat, Doug Joe
hnson, John Chambers, and Frank
Weidling in addition to divers Lare
ry Huntoon and Craig Du Bois will
be needed in order to take the title.
Tonight the team faces Luther here
and tomorrow Coe, Carleton, and
Cornell swim the Pioneers in the

A year ago at this time Grinnell’s
basketball team was still looking for
its first win. This year the first
wm came early in the second game
at the season, when the Pioneers
whipped Graceland in the second
round of the William Penn Tourna-
ment. A fluke? Apparently not, si-
nce the club grabbed two more up—
set victories before Christmas, in
the University of Chicago Holiday
Tournament. There the Pioneers
surprised both ColoradoCoUegeand
Knox to win the Tournament.

As the December Tournament be»
gan Grinnell was seeded last, and
was to play deieuding champion

quickly ran up a lead and, alter
leading 42734 at halftime, won the
game 77457, Bill Bailey, Dennis
Moss, and Paul Delaney combined
for 64 of Grinnell's points.

The strongly-iavored Knox squad
entered the final against Grinnell
with an attitude of sheerconﬁdence.
The Siwashers showed their con—
tempt for the Pioneer team by
warming up at the Grinnell basket
during halftime. Grinnell stunned
the overeoniident Siwashers, how
ever, by outscoring them 42-23 in
the second half to take an easy 81-

Kumler Takes Soccer Honors

by Dave Calvert

Roger Kumler, most valuable ple
ayer, headed the list of soccer a
ward winners in team balloting that
took place shortly before Christ—
mas break. For Kumler it was the
natural culmination to a very dis~
tinguished Grinnell soccer career.
The senior has now served as de~
iensive Captain and won MVP hone
ors each or the last two seasons.
Wade Lee ran away with Rookie
of the Year honors. playing most
of the season at halfback, the Ire»
shman Speedster still scored two
goals and looked strong throughout,
despite late—season injuries.

Junior Phil Foster and sophomore
John Haigh tied in the balloting for
the Most Improved Player. Foster,
at hairback, showed progress
throughout, compiling a lot at play
ing time late in the season. Haigh,
a newcomer to the sport, did a

remarkable job in the goal, where
‘he started the last five games,
Haigh got Credit for a shutout Oct-
ober 17, when the pioneers sur—
prised Mldwest Athletic Conference
champion Knox, 170.

Seniors Glenn Cushing and Peter
Horowitz, and sophomore Jim Free—

man, gained a three—way tie in the
voting for a Loudmouth of the Year.
All three were abundantly deserving.

The soccer team’s outgoing cap-
tains are Horowitz and Kumler. Next
year's captains are apparently tube
elected in the near future.
