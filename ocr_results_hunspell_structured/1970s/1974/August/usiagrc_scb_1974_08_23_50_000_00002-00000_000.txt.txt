Summer tutorials end

by Susan nepp
This summer 29 incoming freslle
men got a head start on Grinnell
campus orientation These
students responded to an invitation
to attend an experimental tutorial
that was scheduled to start two
weeks before the tall semester
classes formally began

Prof, Charles Davis 01 the Black
Studies department headed the
program. Davis explained that
three freshman tutorials were
designed to develop reading skills
and writing ability. A special two
week session of intensive lab work,
and faculty supervision was
thought to afford the incoming
freshmen a sound introduction to
the vigors of Grinnell course work.

Allowed to Merge

Al the completion of the pre-
semester session, each of the 29
students would he allowed to
merge into the formal study of the
tutorial designated to them.
Courses offered in conjunction with
this program are “Black
Religion," taught by Dennis Haas.
religious studle “Third World
Literature" with Davis, and
“Alternative Cultures," taught by
Ronald Kurtz, anthropology.

The students’ schedule was
demanding. Each morning began
with a morning assembly in
Steiner 27, then tollowed by an
individual writing lab conference
which lasted from 30-40 minutes.

Library skills labs were taught
by Harold Hosel, reference
librarian, and by Ms. Mary Clot-
felter, reading lab director. The
sessions were taught on alternate
days, and lasted an hour in each‘
case.

Seminars

After lunch in the private dining
rooms underneath the Forum, and
an hour rest session, students
proceeded to a twoshour afternoon
seminar with their tutorial in
structors,

As writing was the emphasis ol’
the program, students produced a
great deal of written work Within
the two weeks of classes. Almost
every morning a three to eight
page essay was handed in to the
student assistants associated with
the program The papers were then
subject to revision by the writing
lab instructors, Each student was
told to examine his writing
weaknesses and strengths, and to
concentrate on developing ef-
fective composition skills.

Softball
The program was not. however,
all 'work and no play, Maurice

Hunt, administrative assistant,
became activities director and
managed to rouse up enthusiasm
for a studentsfaculty softball game.
The results were disastrous (or the
students, who lost 14 to 2 A peace
offering was made in the form of a
student bike hike to a farm owned
by Prof. Alexander Moffett,
theater.

Last Sunday all academic ac-
tivrties ceased while the staff and
students took the day off to attend
the Iowa State Fair.

Results

The pressure produced positive
results for the early students. Most
participants admitted that they
benefited [mm the experience and
felt that they would be on steady
ground once the autumn courses
week began.

Michelle Vale said, “It gave me
practice with criticism." Anothcr
student,‘ Marilyn Lord, com-
mented, “I thought the profs were
being helpful and extremely
personal.”

Perhaps Dan Featuerston
summed it up best with the simple
statement, “I am really glad I
came.”

1021 MAIN

In the first district congressional
race, another good battle is
shaping up between Ed Mezvinsky
of iowa City, the incumbent, and
his Republican challenger, Jim
Leach, a Bettendori businessman.
Mezvinsky, a key member of the
House Judiciary committee,
gained national exposure when he
introduced an unsuccessful ims
peachment article regarding
former President Nixon's taxes.

But his service on the committee
has also provided Leach with his
major campaign lniormation to
date. Mezvinsky has admitted
accepting $17,500 from dairy lobby
groups in 1972, and has refused to
return it He says the money
represents contributions from one
of his major constituencies, lowa's
dairy farmers.

Leach claims Mczlvinsky‘s ace
ceptance of that money while
serving on the judiciary committee
constitutes a conﬂict of interest.

It's still too early to tell whether
that issue will make any difference
in Leach's uphill fight to oust the
freshman legislator. But it appears
that the race may be a real fight
instead of the yawiier that was
expected last spring.

As the campaign continues, the
thing to watch will be the effects of
the turbulent national political
situation on Iowa races. The
campaign is beginning on a
spirited note, and it promises to be
zln exciting one.

He would like you to know
That it’s been swell

But it’s time lo sell. _

A new operator there will be.

Best wishes for the coming year

For the moment we are still
