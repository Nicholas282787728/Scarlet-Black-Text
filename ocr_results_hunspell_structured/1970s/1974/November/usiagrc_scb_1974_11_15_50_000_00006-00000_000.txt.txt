Fonda lives character's anxiety.

By Tom simpson

Peter Fonda’s movies give us a
chance to see what might have
become of James Dean if he'd
lived, Of course, Fonda doesn't
have the magnetic intensity oi
James Dean, but they are similar
in that they both live the anxiety
and confusion of their world
directly into their characters, to
such an extent that the actors
sometimes seem to be rebelling
against the very role they are
supposed to play within each
movie.

Unlike Dean, however, Fonda
has developed toward a tran-
scendence that tries to understand
the contradictions that plague
American antirhcrocs By sim-
pliiying and clarifying his syms
bols, Fonda has erased the
boundary between pop and elite
culture,

In the driverin scene in Rinlol's OI
Eldritch, the greaser makes out

while his chick chatters
garrulousiy about her dreams. The
greaser doesn’t need to verballze
his iantasies because they're
taking place on the screen in iront
of him‘. it could be Peter Fonda in

The Wild Angels. translorming his
adolescent torment into macho
power.

Tilt: llh-ed Hand is about the
same impulse seen from a dif-
ierent angle, a iew years later. in
this movie, set in the mythical

West, Fonda feels that his hells
raising days are over, but doesn’t
know what to do with himsell. He is
homeless, suspended hwtween the
romantic vision of living at the
edge oi the frontier in isolated
freedom, forever on the road, and
acceptance oi a settled way of life
and Submission to a fixed Social
code, symbolized by his exude,
their daughter and their iarm.

Fonda uses this allegorial lore
mat for the exposition of a duality
which he believes to be central to
American Culture. It's a common
theme, but rarely treated with an
eiiort to discover a resolving
transcendence Fonda’s effort is
carerul, sincere, and lyrically and
poctieally constructed, The clarity
that predominates throughout the
tilm suggests a way beyond the
anxiety of the Wild Angels and the
resignation expressed in next
week's TRASH.

Rajko infects dance fervor

For those who saw Rajko the
Hungarian Gypsy Orchestra and
dance troupe last weekend, it was
an exciting alfair For two hours
Darby was filled with skillfully
athletic dancers in wildly colorful
costumes hacked by a full
Hungarian Folk orchestra.

The Rajko troupe is made up of
actual Hungarian Gypsies who
make up about nnehali of one
percent of the Hungarian nation.
Most of them have never taken
formal musical or dance training,
but have picked their knowlege up
from watching and working with
members oi their iamily or
