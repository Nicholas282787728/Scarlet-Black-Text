Froth
Brine

Come, wanting to show the way
Laughing to selves, watching, ﬂoating
In wonderful neverland, suds and air;
Creamy sailships slide by gliders and rafts
Froth elemental

Foam plenty for all;

Crew drifting, craft in time unchanged
Bailing broth drenching, seeping

Row the vessel, lay the word on its side
Bounding unbound

While on land, still there

Broth

Requiem for an Old Aunt

The paint is peeling off

The apartment wall
Where the old sofa
Used to stand.

The incinerator has converted
The carefully laid newspapers

Into charred yesterdays.

Locks on the door

Could not delay lamentations.
The packet of gaily colored ribbons

ls gone.

atop lapidary bricking somber mooncrash
sulks

nobility, in the crisis of light, scooped
hollow by early morning metal wind
vicious array of breathtouch spills
between the cracked logic

of a solitary fence

bemoaning quadrupeds uncertain sketch

the scarred texture of rainshed insect
seeping into doubtful substance

dissipating, the siren weeps remote tensllity
scraping with sound the sheeted electric
perimeter

like a crab in a classical landscape
lost among strange suburbs

he will denounce the secular insects
he will relinquish in hypothesis

the constant visitor

I found a small clearing in the woods

Where midnight touches reeds in silver darkness
And mirrors in the calmness ofa pool

Satined by moonlit madness

Passing after a quiet roaming in stillness,
I saw a Witch of herons waiting

On? legged, silent grey ghosts of mist
Twrsting slowly to inspect the night

Amazed, I paused to investigate and wonder,
The clearing filled with moon and rabbits
Who lay beside a pride of foxes

To shield themselves from chilling winds.

I took a seat between two dark oaks

Sheltered by the midnight shadows

Hidden by tall grass and reed oauls

Watching with cold eyes, shivering.

And he came and drank, shining with the moon.
Silver coat gilstering with midnight dew

Stepping slow, bending to sip crystal waves,
Tossing back the deepest shadows with his horn.
I slipped away, dream-blinded,

He followed; and darkness came with the shadows
He haunts my pathways, recalling midnight
Waiting for the darkness in the moon.
