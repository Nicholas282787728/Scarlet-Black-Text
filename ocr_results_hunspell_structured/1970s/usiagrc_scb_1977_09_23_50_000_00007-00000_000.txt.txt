Male harriers remain
unsurpassed

By Tim DeCoster

“It‘s been a long time since
we’ve won a meet this big. Let’s go
get them.” With those brief
remarks, coach Ray Obermiller
sent his cross country squad
against teams from eleven other
schools in last Friday’s Monmouth
Invitational.

And get them they did. Pioneer
Terry Drew won the four»mile
race, shattering the course record
by some 30 seconds. For freshman
Drew, his 21:01.9 effort
represented his second victory in
as many collegiate races, It’s
likely he would have broken 21
minutes had he not slipped and
fallen at one of the treacherous
spots on the rainrsoaked course.

Drew turned in an unbelievable
4:58 first mile before settling down
to three consistant miles. (The
time for each was within one
second of the others). Paul Reich
finished third overall in the meet—
his personalvbest time of 21 :28 also
bettering the old course record.

Led by Drew and Reich, the
Pioneers upended defending
champion and host, Monmouth, 48
to 66. Dubuque ran a close third,
finishing with 35 points. In addition
to Monmouth, Grinnell defeated
three other conference rivals and
established itself as a definite
contender for the conference title.
Coe and Cornell fell to the Pioneers
for the second time this season and
Knox also bowed to defeat.

Since the end of last season,
Obermiller has considered the
potential of his 1977 runners with a
carefully guarded optimism. “This
could be one of the finest team’s
ever in Grinnell's history,” he
commented earlier in the season.
Following the meet, one could not
help but see that Obermiller was

 

more than pleased with the efforts
of his squad,

Not only did Drew and Reich
turn in fantastic races for this point
in the season, but the team's
strongest point, its depth, proved to
be invaluable in bringing home the

Saturday, Grinnell will host 13
other teams in the annual Les Duke
Invitational. The meet will serve
as a test to determine if the
Pioneers are able to continue
running well as a team and thus
build a strong challenge for
returning champion Carleton at
the November 5 Conference Meet
(also at Grinnell).

Obviously, Obermiller hopes to
go all the way at the Les Duke.
He noted that “outside of
Augustana and Luther, we should
be able to handle everyone else if
we run reasonably well. And for
the first time in our history, those
two schools will not be out of
reach." Grinnell will run against
the same four conference rivals
which raced at Monmouth. The
only other conference team the
Pioneers meet before November 5
is Beloit, at the Coe Invitational.

Tomorrow’s four-mile race Will
be run at the country club north of
the campus, beginning at 12:00
p.m. A little over 20 minutes later,
Obermiller will know a great deal
more about his team’s consistency
and its strength,
firstrplace trophy. Newcomers
Kevin Koy (21:56). Joe King
(21:57), and Dick Gilbert (22:09)
finished 13th, 14th, and 17th,
respecitvely in scoring for Grins
nell. Kay and King combined with
the top two Pioneers to collect four
of the mugs given by Monmouth to
the first 15 finishers. Tim DeCoster
(22:13) and Roger Sayre (22:45)
rounded out the Grinnell placers.

deﬂate V-ball

Women‘s varsity volleyball is
under way. Last Saturday, unr
derdog Grinnell
overpowered Cornell and Iowa
Wesleyan. Coach Tom Latimer

attributes the team’s success to

“hustle and determination.”
The Pioneers opened their attack
on Cornell. The stupendous spiking

by captains Marni Curran and1

Ann Chasson proved to be too
troublesome for the Rams. The
Pioneers stomped Cornell in
successive games, 15-9 and 1513.

Iowa Wesleyan gave the
Pioneers more trouble than Cor-
nell, but Grinnell won Hie match in
a crowd pleaser by me scores of 15-
13, 745, 17715. Again devastating
and overpowering with her
spiking, Curran led the offensive
attack, Chasson and the team's
third captain, Kim Brydon, played
steadily throughout this match.
Their reliability is invaluable in a
sport as emotional as volleyball.

posing player’s spike. Cathy
Sessler, an inexperienced
newcomer who Latimar said has
“improved dramatically." came
up with essential digs throughout
the matches.

This 'past Tuesday the team
ventured to Pella, Iowa and battled
Central College. Central’s squad,
much improved from last year,
handed the Pioneers their first
defeat. Grinnell playing without
the help of Curran, lost 1'15, 15-10,
10-15, 10-15.

The JV squad played on the same
dates as the varsity, It won a close
match over Iowa Wesleyan but
afterwards met defeat at the hands
of Cornell. Susie Edmonds and
Anne Harrison spiked the air out of
the ball for Grinnell’s offensive
attack. Enthusiastic captainrforr
therday Maggie Klingle and Leslie
Workman did well at setting the
ball for the spikers.

Big feet
score,
score, score

By Colin Sacks

Well, we finally won one. The
Grinnell soccer team squeaked out
a 372 victory over Cornell in its
home opener Saturday before an
excited crowd of more than 50 fans.

Speedster Mark Bailey opened
the scoring in the first half when he
broke through on the light side and
blasted the ball just under the
goalie’s reach. The Cornell goalie
demonstrated his feelings by
sprawling on the ground. For
nearly a minute he gaped at the
sandy earth before his face.

His despair was short lived,
however, for Cornell tied the score
at one before the half.

Early in the second half Cornell
took a 2—1 lead and appeared to be
dominating the action until Rich
Fendler breezed into the Cornell
zone and tied the score at two.
Then with 12 and a half minutes to
go, it was Bailey again, this time
scoring on a booming shot from
outside the penalty area. Again the
Cornell goalie conversed with the
earth.

Freshman Pioneer goalie Dan
Dunlop played a good game,
showing poise and confidence, and
directing the defense with a
barrage of instructions. Another
freshman, Sam Zellner. played an
excellent game at halfback while
filling in for Pete Levy. He
demonstrated a great deal of speed
and endurance and kept pressure
on Cornell’s halfbacks.

Zellner'attributes his success to
abstinence from sex and hard
liquor. as well as late night
practices in his hallway on Haines
third. Haines I-Iall residents had no
comments.

Team members were optimistic
about the rest of the season when
they discussed the game in the Pub
on Saturday night, Everyone
agreed with Pete St. Thomas’
contention mat the team could win
the rest of its games this season.

The next home game is
tomorrow. Grinnell and Cornell
will be playing a junior varsity
match. On October 1, the varsity
hosts Drake.

The Grinnell women’s cross
country team turned in an im-
pressive performance at last
Saturday’s Luther Invitational in
Decorah. The young team’s sixth
finish out of 12 teams was par
ticularly noteworthy when con-
sidering the powerful competition
found at the meet.

Grinnell’s top finisher was Toni
Heiman. She finished nor! in a
field of 200. Her finishing time
(13:11) was a personal best time
for a two~mile meet.

The team’s last two per-
furmances have earned Coma
mendation from the coaching staff,
This year’s squad impresses
everyone affiliated with cross
country. People are invited to

Stickwomen
split

By Laurie Cragg

The Grinnell field hockey team
split its first two games this past
week, winning against Iowa
Wesleyan and dropping a game to
University of Iowa.

The Pioneers looked strong last
Saturday, beating Wesleyan H in
an easy victory. Sophomore Kim
Krutilla started the attack by
scoring the first goal, Junior Minje
Martinez added another score.
Freshman Harriet Phinney played
a strong game and also contributed
to the scoring attack.

One Grinnell player commented,
”They (Wesleyan) had us outsized,
but we were in better shape and
managed to outrun them.”

Coach Winkler said, “We looked
strong but we’re going to have to
work on beefing up our defense.”

This victory was senior goalie
Katie Duffy's first since she
started playing for Grinnell in 1975.

Wednesday, the team ex-
perienced iLs first loss, against
University of Iowa, 270. Iowa
scored its first goal ten minutes
into the second half. Later, with
less than ten minutes left Iowa
scored again,

Winkler commented. “Cone
sidering University of Iowa is the
toughest contender we will face
this year, we proved to be viable
contenders." .

The Pioneers will face
Graceland today on Ward Field at
4:00 p.m, Graceland has lost many
of its last year’s players. Coming

By Chris Sodoma

”There are three kinds of lies—
lies, damned lies, and statistics.”
These immortal words uttered by
Disraeli come to mind when
looking at the ”stats” of the
Pioneer's opening day football loss
to Iowa Wesleyan, 7-0,

The Grinnell offense was con-
sistently gaining yardage on the
ground against the “home
towners." By the afternoon's end,
the Pioneers had amassed 279
yards in 75 attempts for a 3.7 yards
per carry average on the ground.
The “Big Gainer” for Grinnell was
Al Camp who had 113 yards in 20
carries for a 5.6 yard average.
Coach Edd Bowers was also im-
pressed by the fine work of Chuck
McKinnon and Tom Briles at the
halfback position.

In contrast to the Pioneers’
potent running attack, Iowa
Wesleyan could only accumulate is
yards in 21 carries on the ground
against the s ingy Pioneer defense.

Through t e air, Iowa Wesleyan
had much more success. Wesleyan
QB Ron Monahan completed 14 out
of 15 passes, including a fourryard
TD pass to Jim Leigh for the only
tally of the game, early in the third
quarter.

The Pioneers’ scoring drives
were thwarted by costly penalties
and four critical turnovers.
However, the offense did earn 25
first downs in 96 plays to only seven
for Iowa Wesleyan in 49 plays.

Bowers seemed pleased with the
overall play of the squad. He
thought the running was generally
good and the defensive play was
adequate. He was particularly

pleased with the fine play or Chris

Mol at center and Mike Kearney at
tackle. Bowers added that he
thought the entire defensive and
offensive lines played well,

The Pioneers open their home

against Beloit on Rosenbloom
Field. With a little luck and a lot of
fan support, the Pioneers should be
able to turn the final score statistic
to their favor.
