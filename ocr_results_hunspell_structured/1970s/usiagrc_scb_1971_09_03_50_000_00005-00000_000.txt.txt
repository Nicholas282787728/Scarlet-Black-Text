Since i’ve been talking about

great keyboard artists, Itho- a

tight it would only be right
to mention Leon Russell. Russ
sell has an album out called
“Leon Russell and the Shelf
ter People," which features
Leon on the piano and a lot
of his friends on various gui»
tars, drums, organs and vo-
cals! Leon Russell is probabr
ly the best pianist in the
rockrworld today, and thisal—
bum is good proof. The al-
bum takes on a “Mad Dogs
and Englishmen" sound with
Russell singing leadvocalsinr
stead of Cocker.

Russell’s voice is strange;
it takes some getting used to.
It has a slightharshnessmorc
dering between Rod Stewart
and Joe Cocker. Russell is
at his best singing bluesnums
bers, bothslowandfast. There
is really no one song which
stands out on thealbum, but the
songs are consistently good.
He starts with a slow num~
ber called “Stranger in a
Strange Land", wherea strong
girls' chorus backs him up.
He gets into some excellent
piano in the second song, "0f
Thee I Sing", a song which he
wrote himself.

He gets into some Dylan,

singing “It’s a HardRain Gon-
na Fall," sounding a great

deal like the song’s composer.
His fourth song, “Crystal Cloe
set Queen" proves he (an al-
so be great doing hard rock.
This is possibly the album’s
best song; Russell’s pianore-
ally stands out. “Home Sweet
Oklahoma" is a song blues
number which Russell also
wrote. The melody is beaus
tiful, having almost ahaunting
quality to it. "Alcatraz” fi-
nishes the first side; it’s an~
other fast moving rock num-
ber. There’s some excellent
guitar work by Chris Stain—
ton and organ by Jim Price.

Side TWO starts with “The
Ballad of Mad Dogs and Enr
glishmen", which has Russell

: on piano and a background of
=strings. This does just not
’belong with the rest of the
album. Strings have their
place in rock, but not with
Leon Russell. The song comes
out like pure ”schtnaltz"; it
just does not work. (By the
way, it's from Cocker's moi
vie, which is‘ fantastic-not
counting this song rand should
be seen by anyone who digs
Cooker.) Russell can be for
given after hearing "It Takes
a lot to Laugh, It Takes a
Train to Cry", another Dy—
lan song. There's some realc
ly excellent steel guitarbacke
ing the slow moving vocal of
Russell. Once again, thepiano
playing of Russell’s is fantas‘
tic; he has the perfect feel
for this slow blues number.

The next two songs, "She
Smiles Like a River", and
"Sweet Emily" are rather
mediocre blues numbers,
saved only by 'more of Ru57
sell’s great piano. The last
song is a George Harrison
composition, “Beware of
Darkness," and itisabsoluter
ly fantastic. It starts outsoun-
ding Indian as Russell plays
in triads leaving out the mid-
dle note, and he keeps the tem-
po moving at a rapid pace.
He then abruptly slows as he
gets to the beginning of the
verse. The song itself is a
beautiful ballad; in fact it was-
probably Harrison's bestsong
on his album. The best part
is saved until last however.
Russell gets into a rousingpi-
ano solo which continues buil-
ding until it fades out; too
quickly, I’m afraid. It’s the
best piano on the whole al-
bum and there shouldbemore.

As said before, there‘s no
song that stands out alone on
this album, but the album
itself is great. Leon Russell
is one of theall-aroundgreats
in the rockrworld, and thisak
bum proves that he can make
it on his own as well. as writ
ting great music for other

music superstars. He should
be listened to.

ing Tommorrow

tende-students, facultywomen
and faculty wives. (Daycare
will be provided). A general
orientation, the meeting will
deal with specific issues on
the Grinnell campus such as
discrimination in hiring, the
extablishment of a birth con-
trol clinic and abortion coun—
selling in Grinnell, radio
programming, special edu-
cation classes for women,and
townrgown relations.

The general purpose of the
meeting will be to bring the
women of Grinnell together.
We are interested in finding
out what your wants and needs
are as women, so we can or*
ganize to bet meet those needs
by shaping specific goals.

W e need to hear from all
of you if tlus meeting is to
achieve its basic goal; the ex?
pression of your viewsis cru-
cial. We can never know
what we can do if we don‘t
lG’lOW who we are!

The Women of Conoco House

twiTiGr-innéllr Group Excnvimstolor’ud'o‘KIWI

by Curtis Schribner

Late last May four Grinnell
students paid $250 to break
their backs picking and sho~
veling under a hot desert sun.
Sound foolhardy? WellI Nikki
Tannenbaum, Connie Poole,
John Pfeffer, and Curt Scrib-
ner don’t seem to think so-
now, at least.

These four students made up
the working contingent of ”An-
thro 399: Directed Field Re-
searc " with Professor R.A.
Luebben. Their goal was to
locate, exmvate, and inter-
pret a kiva structure on the

Ray lsmay Ranch in south-
western Colorado.

Pithouse

A kiva is a covered, un—
derground, ceremonial room
to be used exclusively by men
for the religious rites oftheir
people. Evolutionarily, the ki-
va is related to the primir
tive “pithouses” that date
from about 2000 years ago
and the religious structures
of the present day Pueblo In-
dians of the Ameriain Souths
west.

All of these structures were
built by a group of people cal-
led the Anasazi (Navaho:
ancient ones) who migrated to
the North American continent
by way of the Bering Strait
and then worked their way
sough to the Colorado River
drainage.

Normally, the Anasazi har
cked these kivas from the
ground with primitive stone
axes and their hands. They
were usually 5 meters in dia-
meter and 2 meters deep, th0*
ugh they range in size t025-28
meters like the “GreatKivas”
of the Chaco Canyon area.

Smry View

The expedition’s headquart—
ers were seven miles south
of Cortez and consisted of
four tents set up in a sparse
Pinionsjuniper forest justab»
ove the valley between Mesa
Verde and Ute Mountain.

The nearest water had to
be carried in from l-l/2 miles
away, but that is not to say
the camp was entirely “primir
tive." After all, not many
people can boast of a pre-
fab john with a gorgeous view
of the Mesa and the stars!

This great aesthetic master-
piece and the truly fine coo?
king of Mrs. Luebben made
the camp more than bearable
for the four weeks the group
was in the field. Even the
"shower," which consisted of
nothing more than a hose 5m,
ked around a fence post con-
nected to a very cold water
supply was bearable.

The primary work was done
at a small satellite pueblo
located two miles south of a
large unexcavated pueblo
complex. This smaller pueblo
was excavated by Professor
and Mrs. Luebben eight vears
ago and consists of seven
rooms and a tower.

Smashed Head

No sign of a kiva was found
at that time anda subsequent
test trench failed to turn up
any clues. To have such a
pueblo without a kiva was
rather unusual, though, so two
test pits were dug by this
year’s crew to a depth of
one meter and a wall was
uncovered.

_At least the students thought
it was a wall as none of them
had the slightest idea of what
a wall would look like. Fi’
nally, 3—1/2 weeks,a smashed
head, a sprained ankle, and
thousands of sick jokes later
a kiva was uncovered and
ready to be mapped and phoV
tographed.

Diagram of the Kiva which a Grinnell team exmvatediast

summer in southwestern Colorado.

(by Curtis Schribner)

 

Luckily, the lsmay klva tur-
ned out to be comparatively
small. It stillpresentedmany
opportunities, though, toprac»
tlce picking, shovelling and
wheelbarrowing. The large
number ofartifacts foundwere
all sacked. washed, and num-
bered ifpossible and then re-
turned to Grinnell where they
will be studied and sorted.

The large pieces of char-
coal will be sent to the Uni-
versity of New Mexico toden-
drochronologlsts who will try
to date the kiva by counting
the tree rings and then com-
paring their relative slzes to
known sequences of rings.

A few of the whole bowls
will be put on display in the
Anthropology Department la~
ter this year for the college
to see before they are re—
turned to Mr. Ismay‘s col»
lection.

During the excavation volum-
inous notes were kept on every
aspect of the project. The
position of any important ob-
ject was wrefully measured
and its lecation recorded in
notebooks.

A summarizing statement
was also made at the end of
each day and this information
will he used as reference for
Professor Luebben when he
prepares the final paper on
this area.

Unusual

The kiva itself (see diagram)
was rather unusual in several
ways.

Primarily, there were only
four pilaeters instead of the
usual six in the classical
kiva. These pilasters were
used to support the roof of
twigs and packed dirt.

Secondly, the sipapu had a
pottery neck and was 5 cm
west of the normal north»
south center line. This small
depression represented the
crevice through which these
people reached the surface of
the earth from the under-
World.

Thirdly, the entire kiva had
been coated with a layer of
plaster that had been turned

pink by great heat.

Finally, large charcoal mm
here were found on the ﬂoor
that measured up to two me-
ters long and 20 cm in dia—
meter along with many whole
or nearly whole bowls and
mugs. '

This all seems to indicate
that the kiva burned very quie
ckly and prevented the re-
moval of any religious ma-
terials. There is also a de-
finite possibility that this
same fire destroyed at least
part of the pueblo.

Besides the actual digging,
the students were expected
to learn about other aspects
of the Anasazi culture. To
get a firsthand knowledge,
three field trips were arran-
ged to Mesa Verde, Chaco
Canyon, New Mexico, and the
Kayenna area ofArizona which
were the culture centers be-
fore 1300 AD.

Great Drought

After 1300 few if any groups
were living in this fringearea.
Whether they were driven
from their homes by the 23
year drought from 12764299,
warfare with the nomadic
tribes from further north, or
depletion of their land due to
poor agricultural practices is
not lmow‘n.

However, they did not dis-
appear as many people have
been lead to believe. They just
moved further south where
they met the Spanish a few
centuries later and then be-
came the Zuni and Navaho
of today.

The final day in camp the
students were given five hours
to prepare a final statement
about the lsmay kiva and its
relationship to kivas found in
other culture areas. Having
been eating, sleeping and ii-
ving archeology for the past
four weeks, though, made this
a relatively simple, but im-
portant, request.

As John Pfeffer puts it, “The
work was hard and l was a
little disappointed not to find
any bodies or get to keep any
bowls...but, I'm ready to go
back tomorrow."
