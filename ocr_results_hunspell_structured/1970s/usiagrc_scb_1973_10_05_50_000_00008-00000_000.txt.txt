Grinnell streaks to first soccer win of the season

MAC :Let’s Clean

by Dave Schechter

”This conference is considered a
model conference by those who know
anything about amateur athletics"
and “Some coaches and athletic
directors“ are spending more time
on the road 'recruiting than we
would like," says Glenn Leggett,
college president. Sound contradicr
‘tory. it is. Scholarships tor sports
are illegal in the Mid-West Athr
letic Conference. There are acoup»
19 of schools in the MAC that are
suspect of violating conference res
cruiting rules that say correspon—
‘dence can only be initiated by letter
or phone. Grinnell. the second yo-
ungest member of the MAC, is
telling its elders to face the conse-
quences. -

There was an interesting faculty
meeting Monday that gave its bless—
ing, by a 52»o vote, to allow Lake
Forest all.) College and the Uni—
versity of Chicago College into the

iMAC; both expressed interest in‘
joining. These schools have ath-
letic philosophies like Grinnell.
They wish to have intercollegiate
athletics but not at the expense of
the boys’ educations,

Also, the faculty voted to spell
out the penalties involved in pun-
ishing rules violators. They include
a letter of reprimand. loss of con-
ference standing, and expulsion, Be-
fore, the latter was the onlypunish»
ment. These votes were strawvotes

There are those schools inthe MAC
where athletic staffmembers are not
recruiting, specifically football and
basketball players, just like a big
university. Monmouth has permise

_sion to give out financial aid to
anyone due to their financially weak
status. Monmouth, are athletes get»
ting these ahead of other students.

If so the Grinnell faculty informs
you that by a 33-5 vote to tighten
the rules so that a coach can’t

' initiate correspondence. The fac—
ulty also indicated that they do not

want to keep the present policy
(22718) or to liberalize the rules
(25.6 against). John Dawson, an
econ prof, said of the last alterna—
tive, “We’re going to get into the
athletic recruiting business." Mr.
Dawson, l doubt that will happen.

The most important vote, in my
view, was a 45-2 tally in favor oi
a possible conference split by divi—
sions. One division would include
the academic schools, the “have
nets” (of athletes) in Leggett’s
words; Grinnell, Carleton, Laws
rence, Beloit and then U of Chic-
ago and Lake Forest. Monmouth,
Coe (watch their b-ballteam), Knox,
Cornell, and Ripon would be in the
“haves” division. Some of these
schools have physical education ma~
j'ors. '

The effect is that Grinnell, and I
support this idea of policing vio—
lating schools, is saying that it
will support tightening the rules
and make divisional play with Mon-
mouth and Coe not on them in or-
der to force those schools to clean
up their policies. Another threat
exists, that of schools in Grinnell’s
division secceeding and forming
their own league John Pfitsch, ath-
letic director, doesn’t want to see
this happen since it would ruin the
conference’s family like situation,

Kickers Gain Win

by Dave Calvert

Grinnell’s“ soccer - team finally
broke into the win column Saturday,
by out-classing an inexperienced
Monmouth squad 3-1. For the Pio-
neers, it was their first win against
two losses, and it carried them out
of the cellar of the Midwest Cone
ference Southern Division. Mons
mouth, now 0-3, is in sole posses-
sion of last place. TwooftheScots's
losses have come from Grinnell’s
next opponent, undefeated Cornell.
Although the Pioneers kept con»
trol of the ball throughout most of
the game, for the second successive
week their opponents scored firsti
Due to a leﬁip between starting
goalie Jim Freeman and centerfull-
back Roger Kumler, Monmouth for-
ward Greg Pemberton was able to
punch the ball into the net for an
early 1—0 advantage. Grinnell con»
tinned to control the tempo of the
game, however, and tied the score
on a penalty kick by Peter Horo—

witz. The penaltV. which was dis-
puted vehemently by star Monmouth

fullback Bob Walkely, gave Horo-
witz his fourth goal in threegames.

Harriers 4th

by Mark Blanchard
The 12th annual Les Duke invita-
tional was held last Saturday. Th-
irteen colleges competed and the
cross country meet was won by Aug-
ustana (IL). Second place was won
by Luther, followed by Loras, Du-
buque, and Grinnell. Grinnell knew
they had no shot at the top three
places, but fourth was wide open
for any of seven teams. Unfortun-

«ately, the University of Dubuque

edged out Grinnell for the fourth

spot by a scant three points,
The Pioneers will try

to Stretch their undefeated season
to 470 on October 6, when Cornell
and William Penn come to Grinnell.

Torn Vanderhyden then inserted
newcomer John Haigh at goalie.
It was Haigh’s first official soccer
appearance His job was madeeasy,
however, by the fine play of Pion-
eer fullbacks Glenn Cushing, Rich
Lancaster, Ron Spritzer, and Klim-
ler. Monmouth manged only four
shots-on-goal for the entire game.
As the game entered the second
half, still even at l~1, the 150-
plus home crowd clamored forsome
action--and got it. A defensive vio-
lation was spotted in front of the’
Monmouth goal, and freshman Wade
Lee was called upon to take the
12-yard penalty kick. Lee’s attempt
missed, but due to “unsportsmanllke
conduct" on the part of a Monmouth
player, he was awarded another try.
This time Lee slammed it by the
goalie for what proved to be the
game-winner.

The Pioneer halfbacks and fore
wards kept constant, pressure upon
Monmouth’s‘ defense throughout the

rest of the contest. Although many

scoring opportunities were foiled -

or flubbed, Grinnell did collect one
insurance goal. Pete Shearer, now
in his second season as a regular,
deflected a pass from Lester Ose
between the bars, giving the rich,
eers the final lei margin.

Coach Vanderhyden was right when
he commented through the locker
room jubilee, “We deserved it."
His squad outplayed the Scots in all '

particulars and might well have won ‘

by a greater margin. However, Mon»
mouth was an unseasoned, out,
manned, and dejected team, already
twice beaten. A truer test of the
Grinnell Eleven will present itself

The final score of the Grinnellr
Carleton game was 42-0. Nobody
can take that away from Carleton,
but if you take away the three touch,
downs scored on, or set up by long
passes, and a fourth scored after
the Pioneers fumbled on their Own
five yard line, you have a 1470 game
that would be more indicative of the
type of play.

The Grinnell defense, with a few
exceptions, was adequate all after-
noon. Fine performances wereturn»

horn, who was in on almost every
play that came in his direction, and

Dib-Cowles

by Bruce Johnsun'

This Sunday afternoon at 2:00 the
top two intramural football teams,
Dibble—Cowles and Younkers, will
battle it out for the much respected

championship title. Both teams ap-

pear confident, but the edge has to
go to undefeated DibbleGCwles,
Their offensive attack, directed by
quarterback Dennis Moss, has been
the most impressive of all teams
competing in IM’s this season Di—
bble-Cowles’s front line gives its
offense the time necessary for run-
ning effective plays,

Once beaten Younkers is led by
Rick Faust, who probably runs the
most deceiving offense around. Fau—
st’s mastery of trick plays led many
an opposing teamtowards the wrong
side of the field this season. Younks
ers also has a stable offense which
should give Dibble-Cowles trouble

linebacker Bob Kister, who showed
good aggressiveness and a knack
for being in the right place at the
right time.

The lethargic offense was hamp—
ered by injuries to all members of
the starting backfield Quarterback
Paul Delaney suffered a sprained
ankle, fullback Tom Goetz dislocated
his shoulder, and tailback Mark Sch—
ultz received a mild concussion.

Tomorrow’s Parents Day game
with Cornell will see the now thor-
oughly tested pioneer defense pitted
against a team that likes to pass,
and the shaky Grinnell offense fac»
ing a defense that allowed Ripon
35 points last week,

before the game is over.

Despite earlier rumors that the
game had been moved to Mac Field
to draw a larger crowd, the game
will be played on North Field. North
Field is located directly east of
Ward Field and the Physical Educar
tion Complex, Everybody is urgedto
come out to the game. It appears
to be a good one.
