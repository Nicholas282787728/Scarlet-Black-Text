Hughes: A Part Of Grinnell’s History

by John Wylie

Harold Hughes was a frequent
visitor to the Grinnell campus, mak-
ing five trips during the past nine
years:

His first visit came during his
first term as Iowa’s chief execu-
tive, when he and Governor Frank
Bi Morrison of Nebraska spent two
days at Grinnell under the Politi—
cian in Residence Program.

Hughes spent March a and 6, i964
on the campus, living, eating, and
.attending classes with students. He
lived in Langan Hall during his stay
while his wife resided in Haines,
Both were inducted into their adop-
ted halls as honorary members,

Hughes made no formal speeches
during the two day visit, but spent
it instead talking informally with
members of the campus community.

His schedule shows that he parti-
cipated in an afternoon workoutwith
the varsity basketball squad, and
spent an evening having an “informal
rap session” with residents of North
Campus dormitories.

Hughes next came to Grinnell durr
ing the two day visit of former Prer
sident Harry s. Truman in October
of i964. Truman captured the spot»
light, with his now tamous press
conference that ended early because
some sharp student questions upset
the former Chief Executive

But Hughes met with the former
chiet Executive during his stay,
and attended Truman’s lecture on
“The American Presidency ”

Hughes was at Grinnell again se-
ven months later when he partici-
pated in the third biennial State
Legislative Seminar.

Hughes, along with the top lead—
ers of the lowa House and Senate,
was featured in three formal seSSr
ions Outlining the legislative SeSr
sion and major statewide issues
Hughes was absent from Grinnell
for four years, during which time
he was elected to his third term
as governor and his first term as
United States Senator.
when he returned on May 30,1969,
it was to receive an honorary Doce

ERRORITE‘”

tor of Laws degree from the Coll—
ege and to deliver the commence»
ment address.

in his address, Hughes focused on
the contemporary issues of‘Vietr
Dam and college protest. He called
for consideration on both sides.
“I believe we need persuasion
along with protest -- a continuing
dialogue between the older and youn—
ger generations, and a dialogue
that must not be one-sided."
Hughes last visited Grinnell on
October 19, 1972, in support of the
successtul Congressional campaign
of Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa City).
Hughes praised Mezvinsky ash man
“who symbolizes what is good in
the American political process”,
and blasted President Nixon (or
his failure to end the Vietnam war.
“I couldn’t have believed four years
ago that we would elect a Presi-
dent _. Democrat or Republican ,,
who would not have ended the war
within a year’stime...’1‘he President
has failed.”

The speech was reminiscent of
another address, made the previous
May to an antirwar rally in down-
town Des Moines attended by several
hundred Grinnellians, in which Hu-
ghes once again condemned the war
on humanitarian grounds,

Despite techinical problems, which
made Hughes’ address by telephone
lroin Washington virtually unintellr
iglble until relayed by an aide, Hurt
ghes is credited by many with keep-
ing the large demonstration peacer
ful,

Demonstration marshalls were
ahle to restore calm to the group
several times by simply pointing
out that Hughes was risking hispol-
itical life by openly supporting the
Des Moines protest.

Many Grinnellians thought of Hugh-
es as a friend, and he was univer-
sally respected on the campus, Thus,
the reaction to his retirement an-
nouncement Thursday was bestsumr
med up by one sophomore who said
Simply, ”lts awful. just awful.”
