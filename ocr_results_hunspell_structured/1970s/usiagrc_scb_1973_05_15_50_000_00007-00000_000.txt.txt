SGA Resignations

Student government oiiicials were iaced
irom the beginning oi the year with a prob
lem which was to plaque them throughout
most oi ‘72-73ﬁthe resignations oi key
members. Terry Woli and Loren Hart, who
had been appointed to the positions DISIudent
Coordinator and Student Auditor at the
iourth-quartcr mark oi the previous year
both resigned over the summer.

Hart leIt Grinnell a year early to attend
Columbia University law school and Wolf
resigned, as he explained later in a letter
to the 58:8, ”to make the best possible
use OI my remaining opportunities at
Grinneil," Craig Kugisaki and Michele
Conway were eventually appointed to [ill
the positions,

Financial matters zit the college were
helped considerably when President Leggctt
announced at the iirst iaculty meeting oithe
year that the Gardner Cowles Foundation had
given Grinnell a grant oi $1 million in re-
‘cognition oi Grinnell's “superior" educar
tional quality and “with the hope that it
will insure Grinnell’s being able to continue
in the Iuture at the same high levels."

President Leggett, in conjunction with his
announcement of the grant, also initiated
an academic study oi eight questions re—
lating to educational policy to be conducted
throughout the year.

Public Interest

As a [allow-through on the student idealism
of protest marches and political organizing,
Ralph Nader and associates had Torseveral
years been working on the concept oi a
Public Interest Research group ﬁnanced
and operated by student organizations in
various states around the country. In the
{all of ‘72 the movement came to Iowa as
the Iowa Student Public Interest Research
Group (ISPIRG).

Several interested Grinnell students began
participating in the top levels of the organs
ization scan alter the beginning oi school.
Students were invited to signa supporting
position during the iirst weeks oi the year,
and by the second week in September a ma-
jority oi the student body had indicated sup-
port oi the organization and Grinnell began
participating as a regular memberl
Grinnell enthusiasts Mary Jane Wynn and
Curt Gorrell Soon became leaders at the

state organization, Ms. Wynn as the Chair— ~

man of the state board and Gorrell as the_
communications coordinator for the state.

Throughout the {all a series of hearings
were conducted throughout the state to de-
termine the principle areas oiinvestigation.
Administrative problems and funding diffi-
culties, however, were to plague. the group
throughout the year both on the state level
and at Grinnell.

Politics “72

Regardless oi whatever college and student
news tilled the pages, however, the major
concern of the campus, as well as or the
rest of the nation in the fall 01‘1972, was
the coming election. Soon aiter school had
begun Philosophy instructor Thomas Davis

 

 

won a lawsuit challenging the iowa 30-day
residency voting requirement and that,
together with the ilock oi politicians who
began visiting the campus in September
and October, stimulated substantial campus
interest.

From the beginning Grinnell students, as
expected, showed n decisiveiliberal bent: an
early Sits poll oi campus political views
showed Democratic candidate George Mc-
Govern the solid iavorite oi 78% oi the slur
dents and inculty. Almost 90%olihe campus
community considered themselves to he
Democrats or Independents and, as ex~
pected, the war in Vietnam was considered
to be the primary election issue

Oriented towards political activism in the
classic Grinnell tradition, members oi the
college community were irom the beginning
the catalysts oi the local Democratic orgaiir
ization. Led by county chairman John Piit-
sch, a Proiessor oi Physical Education;
and ”11-72 student government president
Shelley Floyd, who had months earlier
narrowly lost in the Democratic primary
tor state representative; the Grinncllgroup
organized and opened a Democratic neade
quarters downtown and began recruiting
student volunteers to canvass in Grinneli
and nearby areas.

A great deal oi local attention was iocused
on the SchwengelrMezvinsky race tor the
us House or Representatives, since both
candidates were considered to be liberal
in their views and each enjoyed substantial
support among certain segments oi the
college community, The campaign was vig—
orous and exciting, Schwengel challenging
Mezvinsky’s record in the iowa legislature
and Mezvinsky, ior his part, charging Scnr
wengel with “fence straddling politics,"

Also oi considerable interest to Grinnellr
ians was the race between U.S. Senator
Jack Miller, a conservative Republican,
and challenger Dick Clark, a Democrat
who had been an administrative assisc
tant to Representative John Culver, Culver
had decided not to run againstiviiliei- several
months earlier and Clark, assuming the
campaign, embarked upon a iKODrmile walk
oi iowa which took him through Grinnell,

Grinnell proiessor William Vanderpooi
was on the ticket against state represenr
tative Emil i-iusak. Vanderpooi, though rune
ning as a Republican, was considered the
more progressive oi the two and enjoyed
wide support in the Grinnell area,

As evidence oi the widespread political
interest, the Joint Board at onetime voted
that Grinnell should declare election day a

day without classes to facilitate politicali

work and travel to the polling places
The iaculiy, however, reiected the idea
aiter a lengthy debate by a 271 margin.

Hughes Visit

The height oi the 1972 campaign at Grin,
ncll was provided by US Senator Harold
Hughes, who visited the campus on October
19 and addressed a large crowd in iierrick
Chapel. Focusing on the war in Vietnam,
civil rights, and the Watergate brenkrln,
Hughes lambasted President Nixon and other
Republicans ior “unbelievable deception"
oi the American people. SenatorMcGovern,
he said, was guilty only oi “telling the
American people they ought to love one
another.”

Election day brought a mixture oi diSr
appointment and satisiaction to Grinnell
campaign workers. McGovern lost badly
throughout the nation but iared extremely
well within the town oi Grinnell, winning
three oi the town's icur wards and gaining
49% oi the vote overall. Substantiai ViCr
tories by Clark and Mezvinsky took much
oi the sting out oi McGovern’s loss

Disruptions
Meanwhile back at the college, the muse
ually large number oi campus disruptions
caused more concern among Grinncli stu-
dents in the tall than in any year within
recent memory Rowdy drinking and high
noise levels in the dormitories elicited
several complaints irom students as early
as the third week in September, anda month
later the Judicial Council took action by
convicting iour students oi illegal use oi
