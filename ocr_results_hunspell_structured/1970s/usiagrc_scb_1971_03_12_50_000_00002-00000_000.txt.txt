‘THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Faculty Discusses CounciiRoie

by John Nigel Pepper

The faculty settled down this
week in full earnestness to
its spring debate, the topic of
which is nothing less than
“what should the relationship
be among the four estates of
this college?" President Legs
gett made some opening re-
marks, suggesting thata straw
vote be taken on whcthchag-
ee's proposal should be con'
sidered. Placet, 39; non pla-
cet, not enough.

Professor Coltfeltcr took
over the chair and made some
remarks Strongly critiml of
Executive Council practice in
the past. In effect, he assert‘
ed, the E.C. has determined
college policy except with re
spect to promotions and sal-
aries. The administration,
meaning the President and the
Deans, almost always goes
along with the E.C., even
though the Council‘s role is
officially only "advisory."
But the Executive Council is
not a representative body Cl-
otfelter said that it is filled
largely with "professional fa-
culty politicians," who may be
indifferent scholars and poor

This column this week deals
with interpersonal relation-
ships , specifically, the intern
relationship between your av-
erage Grinnell type and your
average 450-pound. 7'foot Ala
askan brown wrestling bear.
This will be followed by the
interaction between rabid Coe
basketball fans and freaked
out Grinnell peoplerwhOAat-
tend-basketball-games. It is
difficult to define people who
attend Grinnell gamesas fans,
but I digress.

Last Friday during the
Globetrotter game’ I was sits

Kathy Ellis and Mario Bogs
nanno were electedpresidents
of the AWS and CofHP boards
by narrow margins in the
Tuesday and Wednesday elecr
tions. The Senate was abol-
ished by 3 363791 vote in
Thursday’s referendum.

Kathy beat Terry Clifford
only by 131-122, While Mario
squeaked by George Shybut in
a runroff, 158146. Mike O’
Connor and Barry Huff were
eliminated in the first round.

teachers and who are encour-
aged by this system to an ins
dulgencc in what he termed

"professional busybodyism.”
The academic reforms voted
by the faculty this fall were
initially received indifferent
ly or with hostility by the mar
jority of the EC., and conser
quently the Committee assu-
med no leadership in the first
semester debate.

The issue is whetherthe fac-
ulty should wield (headminisr
trative power which it does
now, or whether the E.C. shr
ould return to a more strictly
advisory role. If the latter
were the case, it is felt, pro-
fessional politics would de-
crease, the faculty would (lee
mand truer representation,
since the E.C. would report
annually to the faculty and
trustees on the “facultyview”
of the state of the college.

Debate was lively at times.
The fear Ofa despotic admin"
islration has been engendered
even in the hearts of more
recent arrivals by the older
faculty members, who have
suffered through same. The
issue here is: how does the

ton and Glcystecn when a guy
came up to us and asked if we
would like towrestlethis bear.
Naturally, we were prepared
for that kind of question, and
we came to the immediate
conclusion that what the Grins
nell Experience demandedwas
a wrestling match witha hear.
I mean, my father would not
be satisfied unless his $3700
was being wells spent.

The experience was enlight‘
ening. Your wrestling bear
knows more about wrestling
than it might be thought, is
reasonably clean, is extreme-
ly strong, smells nor at all
like a bear-skin rug, and can
tear hell out of your neck. So,
should the opportunilypresent
itself, consider the broaden-
ing aspects of wrestling a
bear, or, shouldyoumiss such
a chance, consider going out
with Hutchingsas comparable.

If bear-wrestling smacked of
Gladitorial combat, the has-

ed only an emperor giving a
thumbs down. Both the Grins
nell and Coe supporters dem~
onstrated as bad a sense of
sportsmanship as I have seen
since the epic Northwood
High—Sherwood High game in
1967. But, as Dirk Gleysteen
put it, "at least inhigh school
there was less rhetoric and
more fights". I am not sure
what was more ridiculous -
the seriousness the Coe people
(as straight a bunch as you
can find) attached to an in‘
credibly poor basketball
game, or the level of child»
lessness the Grinnell people
got into. I was there, and I
must admit that some of thc
yelling, etc., I enjoyed. But
OUE’and’Oul maliciousness is
a bit much.

faculty business and less ad
ministration WITHOUT fear
of future despotism? (I do
mean ”despotism," folks,
'cause that's the word the
faculty was using.)

Cub Story Errs

To the Editor:
I appreciate your recognition
and publicity for the CubScout
program with special educa-
tion students. May it be on
record that I was misquoted
several times in the article
“Students in Volunteer Pro~
grams," 5 a B, March 5.
The generalization, “the
boys come from broken
homes," is incorrect. Anum-
ber of parents have indicated
concern for the welfare and
education of their children.
Also, I have never taken and
am not now enrolled in edumr
tional psychology. And all of
the students namedin thearti-
cle work in the same capacity
as den leaders ofthe Cub Pack.

SAGA Produces Ton 0f Garbage Per Day

rapidly and therefore prevents
such problems.

Saga has cooperated with the
suggestions of the organic
waste group and gotten the
foods mentioned, but many
more foods could be intrcr
duced if the vast amount of
food now wasted was cut down.
The two dining halls produce
a TON of garbage every two
or three days. This amount of
waste goes directly to the city
dump or into the sewage s s-

would be for our own benefit,
in that better foods could be
introduced if Saga didn't have
the costs caused by the enor-
mous wastes. Please stop
and consider taking only what
you can eat. It‘s time to stop
and think about the typical
American philosophy, “we can
afford to throw it out” which
is very prevalent on campus.
Does it make sense?

Besides trying to reduce the
amount ofgarbage, the organic
group is looking into ways of
using the garbage for chicken
or pig feed or compost. From
conversations with a number
of farmers it looks like some
sort of partial recyclingmight
be possible but thereare quite
a few problems with institu-
tiona,l.waste laws, transportar
tion and the enormous quantity
