Lenny Kurz announced his decis-
ion to resign his position oi ail-
campus representative to the Exe»
cutive Council Subcommittee DnEd-
ucational Policies in a letter to
Dean Waldo Walker dated February
1.
Kurz cited two major reasons ior
his resignation in his letter. First
was his belie! that his efforts on
the Committee were “irultless”
and second .was his Wish to devote
his energies to ”other political ac
tivities oi greater importance and
possibilities for positive results."

Scott Well, SGA President, announs
ced that elections will be held Mon-
day, February id to fill the posi-
tion vacated by Kurz. The person
elected would not only complete the
remainder oi Kurz’s terms but wo-
uld continue to serve as the all-
campus EPC representative [or the
next academic year. Applications
tor the position should be submite
ted to the SGA ofﬁce no later than
Tuesday, February 12.

In an interview with the Scarlet
St Black,Kurz emphasized that his
resignation should not be interpre-
ted as a lack of concern {or educar
tion philosophy.

”The EPC was a major part oi my
being lastsemester,” Kurz remarr
ked. In addition to a guided reading

Lightfoot’s 'Suridovvn’

Another Masterpiece

by John who

Gordon Lightfout is at the zenith

of his career, despite the title of
his latest album, Sundown (Reprise
MS 2177) is a superb collection of
pure Lighuoot, smooth and subtle.

Simplicity is the key to Light-
foot’s success. His subjects are
typical people, his settings are ei-
ther unspoiled wilderness, wild
cean, or the down side or the city.

His music matches this simpli<
city. There’s nothing on Sundown
that leaps out to grabyourattention.
instead, there are ten samples or
what has made Lighttootasolidsub
cess after ten albums.

Perhaps the finest cut is "Circle
oi Steel.” Lightfoot has added a re»
corder to nisbackgroundinstrumene
tation, and the able recorder lntro~
duction by Jack Zaza sets a bright,
crisp setting for the drab, dreary
lyrics.

,“Circle of Steel" recounts themir
sery of a slum street in an unidenr
tified Canadian city at Christmas.

social commentaries, but its brev-
ity and unusual structure add enor-
mously to its impact.

The song is unusual enough (and
briei enough) to have some comm»
ercial appeal. Airplay so far has
been limited to a few progressive
FM stations, but “Circle uI Steel”
has the memorable quality which so
often marks a smash hit,

Another cut with commercial ape
Deal-is the title track. ”Sundown”
is smoothly produced (maybe a bit
over produced) and, with judicious
edition, it would be a natural for
Top 40.

Lightioot hasn't had an American
smash since “It You Could ReadMy
Mind," although his album sales
have been excellent. “Sundown” has
the appeal to give him another
number 1 single.

"Seven Island Suite” is the long
est and most ambitious cut. The
topic is a familiar one for Light:
foo _. the rugged beauty oi the
Canadian coast. The skillful, builds
ing majesty of the cut brings “The
Patriot's Dream" from Don Quilts
ote to mind.

in the days iollowing the album's
release, "Seven Island Suite” has
gotten heavy FM airplay, and has
generated considerable listener re»
sponse, at least in the Midwest.

vides nice background.

“High and Dry” is a tongueeine
cheek look at a broken romance.
The lyrics are a bit odd in places
(”Now the Pleasures of the Har-
bor don't include a lady barber”)
but that adds to the song’s bright,
breezy character.

Other good cuts include “The Wa-
tchman’s Gone," a journey with
Lightioot as he jumps a freight
train, “Careiree Highway” as he
leaves yet another broken romance,
and “Somewhere, UiS.A.," as he
enters another in a long string oi
transient romances.

Everything on Sundown is well
above par, even tor Lightfuot’s high
standards. It is probably his best

masterpieces to judge agauist, that
is saying considerable.

Education at Grinnell perpetrated
a class stratification. “What you do
learn is to become dissatisfied with
certain kinds of work." Academic
competition is stressed and rein-
lorced by a grading system where-
in the student tries to better his
neighbor.

but were endemic to all liberal arts

him to question what kind of educa-l

committee as “tokenism” and used
