Music students protest room fee

To the editor: We're being robbed'

The music department has a new
“policy“ ol charging a ten dollar
practice room iee per semester to
all students taking musm lessons
tMusic 220 or 420), This tee entitles
the student to ten hours of practice
room use a week. Because the
money goes to maintain college
instruments, we can understand
why piano students, who use
practice rooms and college in.
struments, are charged this lee

However, to those of us who use
neither practice rooms nor college-
owned instruments, this fee should
not apply. Furthermore, not
enough practice room hours are
available to accommodate all
students lorced to pay lor them.

The music EPC recognizes this
unfair policy. They have suggesled
alternative measures to the music
department. They proposed that
only piano students pay the tee
since they are the ones who in fact
use the rooms. The department

1 think all olus owe a hearty debt
of thanks to Governor Ray,
Richard Turner. the CSL. Seth
Powers and everybody else who is
responsible tor the new policy ot
not spending college lunds on
alcohol.

Much as the 19~year-old drinking
age law and its consequences was
reviled and attacked, this wise and
statesmanlike measure is but the
lirst step in the laudable and long
overdue campaign to remove John
Barleycorn and his evil intluence
from this campus.

INDEED, AS ANY intelligent
and sober observer will note, the
indiscriminate use of alcohol by
Grinnellians is directly responsible
for a whole host of specific
debaucheries and a general
climate of moral turpitude which
has spawned countless offenses to
mind and morals By eliminating
the subtly pervasive eiiects ot
Demon Rum, we can make
Grinnell afar different place and, I
submit, a far better one,

Let us examine more closely
some oi these effects. Many sup-
porters of free booze have claimed
that alcohol usage encourages a
relaxed and uninhibited social
atmosphere. It certainly does: the
type oi atmosphere that attracts
flashers, thieves, vandals and
County Attorney candidates.

IF WE WANT ﬂur college to
remain true to the educational
purpose tor which it was lounded,
we'll do away with the disgusting
habit that is responsible for all-
campus waste, the decline in
academic standards, the rise of the
College Republicans and the death
of Gaylord the Dog,

Yet one would never know the

this fee to all students because of
the cost or the accounting involved.

We strongly feel that all who

opinions to the music department,
Don't let 'em get away with thisl
Cindy .laeger and Nancy
Mellingor.

It’s healthy to have tun, but
senseless destruction is Sick. Since
I have been at Grinnell I have been
a witness to destruction of lounge
furniture, the defacing of dorm
walls, ﬂoors, ceilings, doors and
windows, and rape, pillage and
plunder that would make a
heartless Cossack blush.

These people Should live in
padded cellsl who do they think
pays for all of this—the Civil
Liberties Union? Several weeks
ago a private party was held in
Meurs lounge. The next morning
the lounge was such a mess that
several oi us had to spend hours
washing walls and picking up
dttbrls, but even then the bill for
turther cleaning by the BSrG people
came lo 365.

And where is this money sup.
posed to come from? Our hall
funds! As hall coordinator I would
have no objection to paying the oil]
out of hall funds—if a majority of
the people from my ball had been
largely responsible for the damage
or had it been a hall party

Where are the people that did the
damage? Why aren’t they stepping
forward with their donations? You
know who you are. Why don't you
ask Mommy and Daddy tor the
money? Obviously they’ve never
made you pay [or anything you’ve
broken, or you’d show some

EVEN WHEN THE 5518 covers
a subject that is the direct result of
alcohol abuse, like South Afrlcan
investments, they make not even
the slightest mention of it. The
premise of the “In Focus" story
was that the trustees had failed to
follow through on student protest,
While student interest in South
Africa seems to be on the wane.
This was lollowed up by an
editorial urging student action to
put more pressure on the trustees.
Well, I’m sorry Debbie and Bob.
but nothing's going to happen as
long as you and the studens you
write for remain in a drunken
stupor.

Of course Fritz Maytag isn‘t
going to pay any attention to
students whose biggest concern is
where they can get a hold of his
product. He and his fellow trustees
know that Grinnell students don’t
really care about South Africa, and
even if we did, why shouldn’t the
trustees spend our money to ens
slave the Alrican people it we
spend it to enslave ourselves to

Grinnell College follows the
example at Carleton College.
why have the Carleton students
and their crusading newspaper
editor had such an impact on
college policy? Because they don't
drink, that's why! They drink at St.
mat, and everybody knows how
much better Carleton is than St.
Olaf, or—dare I say it’Y—Grinnell.
FORTUNATELY TIIE new
alcohol policy shows promise of
reversing the disgusting and
licentious trend of drunkenness
and putting us on the same
wholesome wagon with Carleton.
Some students who were weaned
0n the unhealthy tradition of free
liquor at allacampus parties may
wonder what this portends tor the
social and academic .llfe of the
college, in my estimation, it
portends a vast improvement.
JUST LOOK AT the Grinnell
Relays; for several years they
were symbolic of the intoxicated
and selfecentered debauchery that
typiiied Grinnell. But this year,
their entire character has been
changed.
in an eitort to remedy our
glaring deficiency in non-Western
studies, this year’s Relays will be
called The Morary'i Desai Relays,
in honor of t e Prime Minister of
lndia. Parti pants will be en-
couraged to follow the healthful
drinking practices ot Mr, Desai,
embodied in his slogan, “Drink
lrom your own cistern.”
EVERYONE WILL possess his
or her own inexhaustible supply oi
tree liquid relreshments as we
enjoy the testivilies, i can think ol
no better way to celebrate the
temp ary end oi Mr. Mayer’s
and celebrated
association with the Relays, since
he will be leaving Grinnell next
year to work with Joey Chitwood,
The Morarjl Desai Relays are
just one way in which the college
can purge itselt or its destructive
alcoholism and lead the way to a
brighter and soberer tomorrow.
Let's hope that we can continue to
push back the trontlers or sin, and
with the enlightened leadership of ,
the CSL, Bichard Turner. Richard .
