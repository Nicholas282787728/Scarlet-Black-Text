The Scarlet and Black

French Prof: let’s Go To England

by Jim Skarzynski

Victor Verrette, French, is cone
sidering the feasibility of a Grinnell
Overseas Frogram.

Although Grinnell has access to a
great number of off-campus and
overseas educational programs
sponsored by the ACM and other
institutions, Verrette feels that the
college should administer its own
program. He notes that the ACM has
asked member colleges to take
charge of particular programs,

"A Grinnell overseas program
could be more advantageous l‘lnan-
cially and academically to the stu-
dents and the college,” Verrette
noted in a memorandum distributed
to faculty and administration. "The
program will enable Grinnell stu-
dents to predominate, and the col-
lege's own mode of operations and
standards can prevail.” The pro-
gram would keep student tuition
under the college's auspices,

Mr. Verrette would like to locate
the overseas program in England,
preferably near London oranother
university center. Academic credit
would be equivalent to that given in
a regular Grinnell semester. In the
first part of the semester, various
teaching methods would be employed
at the main overseas campus, in,
cluding lectures, discussions, perr

sonal contacts, independent and
small group study, museum and
theater trips, and travel.

in the taciilty memorandum, Mr.
Verette said, “i see this project as
a college semester With spatial mo»
bility and maximal use or student
interest and foreign resources, a 16
week ”college without walls.” Some
ot the traditional instructional me,
thods could serve as underpinning
but the real construction Should be
done by students and faculty in con—
tact with people, things, and places.
With our present improved travel
situation and general student freer
dom, we can expand our curriculum
be leaving Iowa tor a while."

The program, which would he held
during the fall semester, would be
taught by both Grinnell and English
personnel. During the second hair
of the semester, each student would
undertake an independent project.
The project would be Subject to the
current guidelines concerning indes
pendent study, but could be under-
taken in England, elsewhere in Eur»
ope, or in North Airica. Some stu-
dents would he allowed to continue
into the second semester in order to
complete the project’s require-
ments.

Prejects could include anything
from studying art in the Louvre to

working on a collective farm in
Russia. The burden ot the responsi-
bility of organizing the program or
Study would rest on the student.

While living in England :i variety
of housing options would be open to
the student. Possibilities currently
being considered are rooming with
an English tamily or living in a
small hotel or boarding house.

in order to determine student and
faculty interest in the program, Mr.
Verrette distributed questionnaires
to both students and faculty. The
faculty have not yet responded in
adequate numbers todetermine their
exact interest, but Mr Vei‘rette
feels that more than adequate tac—
ulty interest is present.

He is also pleased with student
response to the program. Nearly
200 students replied to the survey,
most or them freshmen and sopho-
mores The countries in which Stu-
dents were most interested in doing
their independent work were France,
Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, and
Israel Most students wished to Study
some discipline in the Social Scir
ences or Humanities Foreign lang-
uage, history, art and anthropology
were among the most popular areas.

After receiving replies from the
faculty and administration, Mr. Vere
ette plans to make a preliminary cost
analysis of alternative programs.
Once this is accomplished, he will
Call [or more complete information
from interested and knowledgeable
faculty and students in order to ela-
borate a more definite plan, Finally,
he will discuss the program with
interested representatives from
other colleges.

Mr. Verrette [eels that if interest,
support, and finances yustiiy the plan
the Grinnell Overseas Program
could begin by September 1973.

Hong’s Interpret
Kierkegaard Well

by Janet Smith

Small hilt attentive audiences
enjoyed the Kierkegaard lectures
presented by Mr. and Mrs. Hong of
St Olaf College, My ardent admira-
tion tor Kierkegaard impedes an
impartial evaluation of the subject
matter, hut my acquaintance with
his writings incilitutes judgement
about the uccurncy and completeness
of coverage I concurred fully with
Mr. Hong’s intcrpreation ot Kier—
kegnard's philosophy and found his
outline of his thought lucid, ordered,
and easily comprehended,

In the hrst lecture, "Qualitative
Lite Possibilities“, Mr, Hong stres
sed that Kierkegaard posed some
simple questions that had long been
iorgotten by philosophy, primarily;
"What does it mean to be human and
to exist as an individual?” His con-
cern tor duniitativu life possibilities
caused him to emphasize the sub~
jectivity of truth. H15 definition of
this is not the sophistic idea that
the individual is the source of truth
but that each person must involve
himself in the considerstion ottruth
and ought to actualize that which he
envisions to be true.

Kierkegaard lists three possibili-
ties: the aesthetic, the ethical,
and the religious lives, The aesther
no life is marked by immediacy
and is determined by desires and
aversions. The built-in diiliculty
is the same the Epicureans dis
covered, the dialectic of desire
wherein satisfaction bring frustra-
tion. When desire becomes tuliilled
one becomes sated, and loses the im*
petus ior liie. Relationships which
require commitment and continuity
are impossibilities in the sponr

taneous aesthetic life

a distortion

Mrs. Hong gave the lecture "A

women, his meaning ior women,
and for hersclt personally, He con-

union of man and woman makes them

gives one strength for eternity. Wo—
men corrupt men by making them
complacent and comtortahle, This
objection is not leveled exclusively
against women but includes anything
which interrupts a relation with God.
In tact, he does not disapprove of
marriage ior everyone, but caur
tioned against its compromising ef-
fect. Finally he blames man for
blaming women [or his deficiencies.
The remainder of the lecture was
extremely subjective and consisted
of readings from Mrs. Hong's works.

Hong described Kierkegaard as pror

cated individuals, He devoted his
