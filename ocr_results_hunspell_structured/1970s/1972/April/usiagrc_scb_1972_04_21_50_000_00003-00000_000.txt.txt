'I'o Considér long-Range Planning
New Committee!

Dean of Administration Waldo W‘dl-
ker announced last Monday the for-
mation or a temporary s-nienihcr
committee to initiate a new approach
to longri'ange planning at the Cole
lege. The committee, which cone
sists oi President Lergett, Dean
Walker incoming ioculty chairman
Kintner, outgoing iaculty cii rman
Clotfelter, and SGA vice-President
Anne Waller, will meet weekly (or
the remainder of this semester with
a number at students and laculty
members to develop ideas coilcernr
ing the College's assessment oi its
goals and programs as they relate
to the needs oi present and iuture
students,

Beginning next iall a permanent
committee will be established to
investigate more tiioroughly the ins—
as developed by the group during the
remainder of the present year,
i‘Because oi the very rapid nature
at the changes that have been tak
ing place in higher education in this
country" Walker said, “the College
should look at what it is and what it
should be in the future. The needs 01'
the students change, and the college
should be able to respond to these
changes." Walker indicated that one
topic he has in mind is the Considera-
tion or the role oi the College in

relation to the change in numher at
its graduates who enter graduate and
proiessional schools other topics
oi consideration will be the college
calendar, independent study, oil-
campus programs, as well as any
additional ideas developed by the
group.

Dean Walker also announced that
in September 1972 the College will
initiate a study that will, over a
period or years, result in anassess-
ment at the academic programs or
all departments at the College. The
study will involve the appointments
oi two outside consultants to come
to the college and study the academ-
ic oiierings oi the department under
evaluation and to engage in dis-
cussions with students and iaculty

The consultants will then prepare
a report to be submitted to the de
partment and to the administration
tor iurtlier discussions concerning
changes that might be advantageous

to the program oi that department. .

Walker stated that iunds have been
budgeted to support the program in
1972-73. The current plan is to
conduct an evaluation oithe academ~
ic programs at iive departments
each year for the next iive years
and ii the results have proven fruitr
iul, the cycle will be reinitiated

jFasiing- Personal And Political

by Merry Wiesner
“You don’t have to negotiate with
anybody...it’s all just inside your
own head,” Greg vranicar summed
up his views or iasting as a very
special type oi protest, “inside you,
not outside you" Rob Ramer rein»
iorced this ieeling, noting that with
out iasting his involvement was oiten
simply intellectual, and it was easy
to be sucked in, machinerllke, to
what was going on, but fasting deepr
ened his commitment, letting him
become “more human”.
hosting in this way seems to hold
a twofold purpose, both one oi per-
sonal rededicaiion, and because oi
the publicity involved, one oi poli-
ti‘cal action. lnliially demanding only
individual commitment, the desire to
get others thinking about the issues
and perhaps involved themselves
necessitates publicity.
Did the last this week accomplish
anything that those taking part
wanted it to? Although Jim Jacobs
stressed the point that “you can’t
plot out the evolution oi events”,
there seemed to be general satiSr

faction at the way things had gone.
Greg noted that “the people who
came in had some sort or respect
ior us, and we had respect ior them
in return...we started on a higher
plane oi communication.” He went
on to point out that this was the
iirst time all year that he had seen
people really concerned with lla—
tlonal issues.

Besides accomplishing something
on an allrcnmpus level, those that
tasted tell a sense oi personal gain
Although Rub remarked that Organr
izational activity had occupied a lot
of their time, leaving little (or the
personal reaction they had hoped
IDr, fasting seemed to heighten their
awareness and Concern about the
issues. Jim commented, "I could
see every perspective, and you
weren’t trying to always detend your
position.” Greg added “My commit
ment would have been destroyed
much easier iilhadn't been fasting.”
Greg also expressed a renewed
wonder in iood, a new perspective
on the Value of what it meant to be
able to eat all that you wanted. He
noted that it was especiallv true in
America, where the consumption lee
vel is so unbelievable.

One especially touching incident
was provided by a group oi Blue-
birds (junior Campiire Girls) irom
town. The little girls came in with
fruit juice, Coke and bouillon (the
only “food" which the [asters were
taking) and gave them to the Herrick
students to show their support One
girl said they had drunk water at
their meeting instead oi iruit juice
so they could make the contribution.
Thus lasting, which to many seems
to show the utmost in frustration,
seems to involve positive iorces as

part, increasing their appreciation
of national issues and things going on
all around them, but locusses c0m~

Trustees Expand College Program

by Steve Nunn

Last weekend the Board at Trustees
passed several recommendations
concerning Cullcge policy, curricur
lul’n, and personnel which had been
put before it by the Board Chairman
and President Glenn Leggett
In the policy area, the Board con-
firmed the Executive Council’s
pledge of ”strong Support to the
principle of equality oitreatment”
for men and Women faculty meme
bers “whose protesswnal qualiiir
cations and contributions to the
College are equal.” This reiterated
a statement made by lhe Council in
February,

The Board also removed the posi-
tion or Lecturer irom the iaculty
hierarchy, and set it up in a special
outside category or its own. The
change was made at the request oi
the President to disconnect the posi»
tion from tenure and thus facilitate
the appointment oi Lecturers. The
position had previously ranked just
below instructor and just above
Assistant on the i'aculty ladder,
a third policy move was the ap
polntment of an all hot: committee
to study the positions of Dean oi
the College and Dean of Adminir
stration. These two positions were
tailored for the Wall—Walker team
and will probably have to be re
defined somewhat because of Mr.
Wall’s decision to resign the Deane
ship. »

The committee will make recom-
mendations about any needed
changes to the Board and the Pres—
ident. It was unclear how the Board
planned to get student input on the
matter.

PERSPECTIVE from pastel

There are results irom the general
meetings and the other student power
activity before Spring break. There
will he E.P.C. reform, how radical
a change remains to be seen. people
are still pressing tor student rep—
resentatives on the Executive Coun-
cil One of the three personnel
cases is being reviewed. Although
the present war situation has every
shadowed it, there is Still a lot of
support tor the retention or iaculty
and RA'S who can show us facts and
a way or living that aren't designed
to support the present system. But
the momentum we had has com-
pletely disappeared and we have not
as oi yet attained any oi the goals.

There are lessons to be learned
from this failure, The most obvious

is that we are fair weather radicals.
it we are serious about our goals we
all have to be prepared to work hard
to attain them. We also shouldn’t let
our movements be castrated by be-
ing overcancerned about the op
positions reaction. And iinally‘, the
Executive Council's decision to
make independent study more siruc»
lured and rigid throws their whole
commitment to gather student “in—
Dut” into doubt.

There are deep contradictions be-
tween the way Grinnell should beand
the way it is run. There is also a
serious contradiction between our
political power and the economic
support we give to the college. We
must discover ways to resolve these
iaults by continued pressure and
