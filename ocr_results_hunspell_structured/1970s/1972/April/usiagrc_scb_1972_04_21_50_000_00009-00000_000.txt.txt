introduction. giving an historical
perspective on the movement (at
least in loan) and pi ovidiiig artistic

Women‘s liberation is one oi those
issues you can be tor without ever
working at it. Just mouth a iew

Celebrate Earth

by Chris Madson
This week is Earth Week. There
has been an April Earth ‘Week for
the last couple oi years, set up as
an excuse tor people who are really
worried about the land to organize
a program to get other people wore
tied, Committees have asked the
famous men in the field of envir
ronment to talk about the problems
at land misuse in America, and the
Sierra Club and other organizations
have amassed volumes olstatistics,
betore-andraiter photographs, and
expert testimonials to let everyone
know about the loss of the natural
environment
Everyone has seen some or the fir
gures, heard a tow oi the speaks
ers, maybe even read one or two oi
the books. Most people have seen
the evidence first-hand: the south
side oi Chicago, has Angeles, Pits
tsburgh, Lake Erie, a California
oil slick. All the educational etc
forts of the first Earth Weeks are
on file in the library or in the book
store; if you're interested in Claims
mentation, 100k for it there, A
new approach to the Earth Week
concept might be better.
Celebrate'
_ This year, get out and celebrate
. Earth Week Spend an afternoon
at Rock Cieek or trike a ride out
to the iield station. Earth Day is
this Saturdav, April 22, and iiyou've
got the time, you might throw in
with the Student Recreation people
and take it trip to Backbone State
Park in northeastern loud. AS
hlird as it may be to believe, the
hardwood iorests and limestone
bluffs in that part oi lowa make

some pretty tine country, a great
place to escape the ivory Tower tor
a few days.

If you don’t have the transporta-
tion ior a trip to Rock Creek (even
with the sailing and canoeing trips
going out all week) and you can’t
spare an entire weekend tor a camp-
ing trip, take a walk up the rail-
road track orbring some books with
you and ioin the study group in the
field behind the north tennis courts.
Take a siesta in the grass.

None oi this is going to move

EARTH DAY
CANCELLATIONS

National Earth Week activities
were to be held on the Grinnell came
pus this week. However, student cone
cern about the war has altered
these Plans. A cleanpup oi the Cone
ard Environmental Research Area
was planned, iocai environmen-
[aliStS were to visit and speak at the
campus Friday and Saturday, and an
all campus organic picnic was
planned tor Friday on Central Cam-
pus. However, the activities’ organs
izers felt that students would not be
able to participate in these activir
ties due to the war protest.

Earth Day plans have not been
completely cancelled, Grinnell slur
dents will speak at Grinneil High
School on Friday afternoon about the
environment, and a clean~up cone
ducted by both Grinnell College and
High School students will Still be held
on Saturday. If Students vote to Supr
port the Organic Picnic, it too might
be rescheduled for a later date

week brought this realization tioiiic
to a lot otmen and women at oriii-
iiell. including mvsoli.

The presentation ranged irom a
iilin and discussion on Growing up
Female to a talk on working poli-
tically towaids changing the outdated
abortion law in lowa Almost all
speeches and iiliiis were tollowed
by iniorinal discussion , whether
planned or not, These were espec»
ially good because the participants.
even when they held a lot oiothcr
things in common, didn't agree. (me
ther unusual at oi-innell where so
oiteii only oneview is seen as accept
nhle) Also a rare teeling oi honesty
and iiankness prevailed in these
discussions, a pleasant change irom
the games oi everyday encounters.

well. Although the political skits may
seem a hit cliche in 1972, the scenes
on seXism had apowertul impact.
The group's ttieme oi the need ior
human liberation dciinitely got
across.

A number oi new people have air
ready begun working with the exist
ing women's liberation group here.
it appears the symposium provided
the necessary push to get more oi
us to stop talking and start doing
i hope 50‘ there's a lot at work to be
done.
