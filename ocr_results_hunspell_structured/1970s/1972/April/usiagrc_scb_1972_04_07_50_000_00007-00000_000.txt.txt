Meg Makes Friends In Russia

by Terry Wolf

Russian House this semester an-
nounced a shakerup in its bureaus
cratic hierarchy. In January, sophoe
more Althea Kallas left lhe United
States ior Leningrad, replacing as
Russian House Ambassador to the
Soviet Union Junior Meg Jess. In
order to put an end to ugly rumors
oi an impending purge, the 5&3 obs
tamed an uncensored interview with
Miss Jess.

In fact, Meg and Althea were recipe
ients oi scholarships from the Counr
oil on International Educational EXr
change (Ford Foundation) tor a see
mester’s study oi Russian language,
literature and Culture Both women
were among a group or only thirty
selected frnm students across the
nation who took a test and submitted
written and oral samples of their
work in Russian.

Classes for participants are held
at LSU -» Leningrad Slate Univer~
sity, one of several large governs
merit operated Universities. The
program included studies oi litera
ture, handled in large lecture ses-
sions, and conversation, phonetics,
grammar and translation —- treated
more intensively in classes or tour
to five students,

The intensive ln-class training was
diiiicult at iirst, but rewarding, Meg
now recalls conversations without
remembering if they were in English
or Russian.

Learning the language was only half
the education Meg received in the
Soviet Union, Meg’s most valuable
personal and educational exper-
iences were with the Russian people.

Early in the semester, Meg became
acquainted with several Russian stun
dents -- in many ways similar to the
kinds of friends she has back home,
she said -- and she spentagood deal
of her spare time with those friends,
It was with these Russian slut‘lents
that Meg would sip hot beer at any
oi the number oi street vending
stands in Leningrad or drink wine at
an automat which featured glasses of
wine ior 40c,

----- miles irom home, Meg was
seldom homesick. She celebrated
both Russian and American holidays
with her Russian friends, Those hols
idays included the New Year and the
October 4th celebration of the great
socialist revolution. Oh the New
Year’s holiday, Meg and her friends

exchanged presents and to make it
seem even more like Christmas,
there were two large, lighted trees
in front of one of the department
stores -- topped by red stars.

Meg recalled one occasion onwhich
she spirited away tor a weekend to
a friend’s Cabin in the country (I
say “spirited away” because the
group did not have the proper papers
to travel where they did) Meg was
the only American in the group and
the young Russians she was with
knew little English, so she spent the
entire weekend without speaking any
English.

Meg was also able to venture out
irom Leningrad legally on trips ar-
ranged fnr the American students by
SPUTNIK, the “semi~professional”
youth Version of Intouriste, Twice a
week the group make excursions
within Leningrad to museums,
schools, candy factories and the like.
On various weekends, the agency are
ranged trips to different Cities and
towns in the Soviet Union. Among
those cities visited were Riga, capi-
tal of Latvia, Tallinn, “little Paris”
and capitol oi Estonia, Moscow,
Kiev, and Belici Meg remembers
vividly the stay in warm Belici
which is located in Georgia, the home
state of Stalin There, while visiting
an old Russian church, Meg was ap—
proached by an elderly Russian woe
man. The woman talked with Meg
briefly, complimented her on her
fluency, and told her the old Russian
words for church and God. which she
urged Meg never to forget.

During the course oi her stay, Meg
became familiar With that famous
Russian institution, the babushka,
Literally the term means grand
mother, but it is usually applied to
the whole Class of elderly women who
spend most or their time giving out
liberal doses of the wisdom of lheir
age to anyone within earshot. Meg
became accustomed to these scoide
ing, old women admonishing her tor
the way she dressed, the way she
pronounced words.

in Leningrad, Meg was iairly tree
to come and go as she pleased and
on one occasion she struck up a
conversation with a millionets (a
police oiiicer, not to be coniused
with the KGB). Meg was a real
curiosity to the Officer and he asked
her questions about life and events

in the United States .. everything
irom Vietnam to Kennedy's Jsslr
nation to Angela Davis

in answering questions about such
controversial issues, Meg said she
always tried to give a well balanced
picture or the beneﬁts and ills ol
American society Occasionallv that
was a diiiicult task, Meg mentioned
that one or the movies she went to
see with tier tricnds was "The
Chase", a Marlon Brando film that
emphasizes the “senillv” side at
American life That sort oi view oi
America appeals to the premdiccs ot
older Russians, Meg noted, just as
the converse would be true here
Meg’s own iriends were more easily
persuaded to accepta more balanced
picture.

By the same token, Meg was able
to see past the textbook description
oi Russia and Russians. Although
pictures or Lenin and Communist
slogans abound on billboards and
buildings, they are seldom round in
homes, and the Russian people, the
young especially, are no time dogs
matic or ianatical about oiiicial
ideology than are Americans.

i asked Meg what restrictions there
were on iniormation she could res
ceive or places she could go. Leis
ters were oiten “obviously opened",
Meg said, and some letters simply
never got through Occasionally,
“American news” would be received
in the form or a Time or Newsweek
which would be devoured by all the
American students. As tar as travel,
Meg ielt that she was tairly uni‘er
stricted, Although one person ii-om
her group had obviously been fol»
lowed, Meg never suspected that
she had been iollowed In the dorms,
in which live or six students shared
a room, at least one or two ot these
were screened Russian students.
“You became cautious when you
were there," Meg said, “but it's
very hazy, you never know.”

Meg said it is "true to an extent
.,that there are everyday treedoms
that you take ior granted”tilul make
it good to come back. but she also
noted that she “can be deiensive
about the ills oi the Soviet system "
While Meg would not want to live in
the Soviet Union, she is anxious to
return and resume her irieudships
with the people.
