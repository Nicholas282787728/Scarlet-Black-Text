Soft Machine: later On

by Scott Mason

Somewhere between Soft Machine’s
second and third albums, their muss
ical concept broadened and changed
in focus The band steered them-
selves in the direction charted by
keyboardist Mike Rutledge, a dir-
ection that called for fewer vocals,
extended solos, rind a greater var—
iety ct instrumentation. Though the
compositions retained the complex-
ity exhibited on the first two alv
bums, increasing Jazz and avante.
garde inﬂuences gave them new
scope and texture.

Soft Machine Third, their first at-
bum on Columbia recorded 1969-
1970, shows them in a transitional
stage. it is a two record set that
contains (our compositions. Each
piece respresehts one of the Ma»
Chine's different tendencies or his
lluences, and as such is the ob»
vious ”first” album for a prospece
tive listener, “Facellit,” by bas-
sist Hugh Hopper was recorded
live early in1970,and showsthe band
at what one Englishcritic callstheir
most interesting and exciting stage.
In addition to the trio oi bass,
keyboards, and drums, ”Facelitt”
features alto Saxist Elton Dean, of
England‘s Keith Tippett Group, and
tlautist/soprano saxist Lyn Dobson
of Caravan.

“Moon in lJune” is the last vocal
composition to be recorded by Soft
Machine. Drummer Robert Wyatt's
piece, it retains the trio iormat
of Volume’s I and If, and features
another sampling of Wyatt‘s strange
and sometimes haunting lyrics. it
is interesting to traceWyatt's ever-
diminishing compositional contri—
butions as the band turns to a more
instrumental concept of playing and
writing. Eventually, Wyatt would
leave the Machine to form his own
vocal and experimental composition
group, Matching Mole.

”Slightly All the Time" and ”Outs
Bloody»Ragrous" are Ratledge’s
contributions to Third. The former
reveals his debt to John Coltrane,
featuring cyclical woodwind work
and jazz»derived themes. Ratledge
possesses a most unique organ sound
and style, playing his Lowery
through fuzz tone and wah—wahpedal,
His solos are heavily derived from
Coltrane soprano sax lines of the
early and middle Sixties, being very
modal in structure, occasionally
presenting an electric transition of
the “sheets of sound” concept. Elr
ton Dean, by this time a perman»
ent member of the band, also has
a Coltrane-like sound on his alto,
and uses squawcks, flutters and
Screams that are remeniscent of
‘Trane’s style. “Out-BloodyeRage»
ous” has a definite Terry Riley in-
fluence, alternating between pas»
sages oi textural keyboard over-

tits I was sittingandbecomingdeep~
1y involved in one of our precept
meetings, an appalling revelation
came out into the open. About nine
out the eleven black students par-
ticipating on the ACM Urban stud-
ies Program this semester in Chi»
cago became interested in the pros
gram in hopes that they would re»
ceive some helpful amount of dir-
action. Once I thought about it. this
shouldn't have taken me so much by
surprise, because an even greater
number of white students are Caught
in the same boat.

Could this be a fault in the way
the liberal arts colleges are educa-
ting its students? 15 it possible that
we’re being prepared (or shall i say
educated) for nothing if we don't
have any direction about us? Well,
needless to say, more and more stu»
dents are participating on the Ur-
ban Studies Program out of this “E,

is an overwhelmingly complexcom—
position by Ratledge that features
perhaps his tinest 5010., layered a.
gainst moving horn phrases and a

complex harmonic/rhythmic pat»
tern, “Kings and Queens" by Hope
per is a beautitully simple bass
line in 6/8, against which is plyed
an ominous yet lyric modal theme
in fourths by alto, muted trum»
pet, and electric piano. Elton Dean’s
first recorded piece with the Ma,
chine, “Fletcher’s Blemish", is
chaotic and electric, reminding one
somewhat of Ornette Cleman’s col—

lective improvisation 0f the early
Sixties, “Free Jazz.” Hugh Hop-
per’s ”Virtually" occupies allot
side two. A wandering, swirling
composition, it seems to be partly
the result ot caretul planning and
thematic statement. and partly the
result of the incredible improvis-
ational empathy existingbetweenthe
players,

Fourth in many ways represents
the highest compositional level yet
recorded by the MachineThealbum
is greatly enhanced by the superb
playing of Marc Chartg and Nick
Evans, cornetist and trombonist re-
spectively with Keith Tippett, and
English avante-garde tenorist Alan
Skidmore. Theirplaying is constanta
ly sympathetic,havingtranslatedthe
jazz concept of collective improvis-
ation into a new context whereby
they play around and encourage the
soloist, never getting in his way.
Double-bassist Roy Babbington, also
with Tippett, is used to great ad—
vantage as a toil to Hopper, alterr
nateiy playing with and against him,
and illustrating an interesting cone
trast between the natural and elec7
tric bass sounds. Ratledge is con»
sistently inventive and interesting,
as is Wyatt, whose instrumental
drumming is some of the tinest
in rock. He plays what might almost
be called “funky" rhythms, but
places them Within the context of
the piece in an entirely different
way, His supportive drumming on
“Kings and Queens,"wheretherhy-
thm is entirely carried by the bass,
is beautifully creative and filling

ledge's “All White” features a re~

has an organ solo on his own com»
position “Drop,” which teatures
Elton Dean on Fender»Rhodes eleu

guest artist Babbington, “L130” by
drummer John Marshall (who supei»

on the album, sounding llke an ab-
breviated version ota Third—vintage
Ratledge composition The piece
features an extended drum solo by
Marshall, who is technically pro»
licient and inventive, but does not

The most valid and musically im-
portant criticism of Soft Machine’s
later albums is that they tend to
lead you back to the sources from
which they gained their inspiration;
Coltrane, Coleman, Cecil Taylor,
Terry Riley, and others. Many ofthe
devices used by the Machine, While
innovative for rock, were fully and
more deeply explored by jazz ar-
tists ten and twelve years ago. Soit
Machine relies heavily on the riff,
which is the foundation of rock mus»
ic; upon electronics and unusualtime
signatures. This is a problem con-
tronting everyone trying to place
jazz-rock within an electric coil~
text; a problem resolvable only
by future developments within the
genre.

‘M‘

Studies: A New Direction

Call it a form of escapism from the
academic pressures of an urban»
isolated, comfortable, liberal arts
college it you like, but what you’ll
actually tiud yourself doing is deal—
ing in a part of “the outside world”
for one semesterwhich is very much
for real.

So you walk into the Uban Studies
program which is structured loosely
enough so that the student is free
timewise to pursuehis owninterests
and needs, but a certain amount oi

time and energy mustbe contributed
to the program so that a sense of

group cohesiveness and cooperation
of the group’s needs can be main-
tained. Now common senseand self—
discipline is of essence here, be-
cause due to the large amount or
exposure you'll receive while in Chi»
cago on this program, you’ll have the
chance to explore your mind and
your thoughts, and in the sainetokcu
you also explore the different di»
mensions of the most powertul, ec-
onomically based city inthe nation
and out relation (as students and
future components oi the svsteml
to it. Therefore, a lot is left up
to the students' discretion as to
which approach you will take in
studying these areas and to whatin»
tensity.

The student, as he becomes a par»
ticipnnt in this system, is forced to
make certain decisions or assump»
tions about it, or to set up certain

alternatives for the system (a goal
relevant to the black section of the
program) As the student widens his
horizons in such current institution»
alized areas as Free Enterprise
(capitalism), the value system, wor»
1d affairs, the political movement
in the U,S., the 1972 elections,
and culture, he becomes functional in
the formation and practicing or the
attitudes necessary for the building
oi institutions, especially alterna-
tive ones.

AS a member of the black section
in the Urban Sudies Program, I am
benefiting from tlle exposure and in-
sight of Chicago life as I identify
with the black community here I,
as well as the other black students
in the program, find it uplittiug
and rewarding to take part in a
community which contains our roots,
unlike the situation, in many cases,
on our college campuses,

in essence the student is given the
opportunity to make the situation
he’ll be involved in relevant to his
capacity as a student and/0r relevant
to his tuture role in society. He can
function as the teacher in this pro»
gram as well as the learner accord~
ing to his and the group’s endeavors.
More students, especially black stu-
dents, are encouraged to participate
on the Urban Studies Program since
it induces you toward a basic sense
oi Commitment and awareness
or yourselt and also to the society
you live in
