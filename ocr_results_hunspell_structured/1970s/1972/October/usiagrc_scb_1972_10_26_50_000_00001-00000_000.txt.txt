Clark Addresses Issues

by Curt Gorrell

Democratic United States Senatorial candidate Dick Clark held an inn
formal discussion with a sizeable group in South Lounge Saturday mornr
ing. Clark's 1313 mile walking tour of Iowa has provided the theme
for his campaign, and this style was evident Saturday as he meandered
slowly through the audience during the hour—long appearance.

“I’m convinced this is a more effective method at campaigning than the
traditional way,” Clark told an 5&5 interviewer, relaxing prior to his
South Lounge address. taking a load off his wellrworn hiking boots.

“l’ve met a very iair cross-section of people, It gave me an opportunity
to meet people in their own surroundings,,,an opportunity to listen to

people and learn from them."

“Listening" is a key word to this
Senate aspirant. “It gets you at
least in touch with the thinking
and the problems as people see
them, and to me that’s represenr
tative democracy.”
in examining the problems oi
America today, Clark believes that
“the most important single issue
we face as a nation and as a peos
pie is the war. Do notbe deceived
into behaving that somehowthiswar
has declined and is almost over...
we cannot in good conscience
begin to turn our attention to other
domestic issues until that problem
is solved.

“The first and most effective way
that we can change that policy is
not to elect Dick Clark and not to
elect a Democratic Congress but
to elect a president of the United
States, to elect George McGovern
Presidentllthat’s the only way

you’re going to basically changethat

policy.”

But the role oi Congress is im-
purtant too “...beCause it George
McGovern is not elected we need

the only other alternative route that
we’ve got But it’s an ineffective
way because the Congress has bee
come so weak by comparison to
the Executive branch that it’s doubt-
ful that the President of the United

States would abide by the decision

voted by the )oint House and Sen-

ate in any case.”

In reviewing the issues oi concern

to lowans in his campaign, Clark

outlined three basic areas where he
and Republican incumbent Senator
Jack Miller maintain divergent
Views. He defined the first in terms
of a “reordering or national prior~
ities."

“Senator Miller argues that we
have to have a Strong defense...
He’s never voted against a military
appropriation, he's never voted
against a cost overrun, he never
voted against a supplementary mili-
tary appropriation in 12 years in the
United States Senate.”

It is Clark’s contention that ”we
can have a strong deiense without
the excessive military spendingthat

loud noise, and was kept awake until
about 2 a.m. At that point, the noise
became particularly loud, and she
went downstairs from her second
ﬂoor room to the loggia in front
of Clark to investigate. She contin-
ued that when she reached the log—
gia, she found a large group oi
people-~“it looked like millions and
millions”~with Clay Williams
bending over a tire extinguisher.
She also recognized the other three

ruption,

After succeeding in persuading the
group to move on to some other
part or the Campus (“after (they)
admired my nightgown and what I
looked like at that hour”), she re
turned to bed. Within a few min-
utes, the Clark fire alarm was set
off.

Seven other residents of the hall
"Kathy MacLaughlin, Linda Thie:
man, Christine Guy, Cathy White,
Melinda McComb, and Elaine Carey
“provided similar testimony. Ms.
Thieman, Ms. Guy, Ms. White, and
Ms. Care were all kept awake by
the noise; the other three witnesses
were not awakened until the fire
alarm was tripped. None oi the
seven specifically saw the defends
ants; they were simply testifying
as to the situation on the night in
question,

Council members next heard tes»

dent of Mears Hall. Breed was
awakened by the noise oi the group
when it entered the Revolving Door,
and was kept awake for about half
an hour more by the noise of a
group “parading up and down the
loggia”, Breed did not see anyone
specitically involved in the disrupr
tion.

Margaret McClellan, a Norris re-
sident, testified that a large group
talking loudly directly outside her
door awakened her at about 1:00

by Mike Breed

A large Crowd of students filled

most significant pieces of legislas
tion it has dealt with this year,
A proposal to supportastudentboy
cott oiclasses on election day pas-
sed by a narrow margm and then
lSPlRG’s proposal to recommend
that contributions for their activities
be collected on the tuitionbill gains
ed the approval oi the board.
ISPlRG (Iowa Student Public lnr
terest Research Group) is a none
partisan organization. They define
their primary goal as ”To articu-
late and pursue throughthe media,
the institutions of government, the
courts, and other legal means, the
concerns of students on issues of
public interest.” The Grinnell
ISPIRG groupjoined the state group
this fall after gaining signatures
of over 50% ot the student body.
The LSPIRG proposal provides for
a contribution of $1.50 per semeSr
ter to be couected by the college
as part of the tuition bill. This cons
tribution will then be turned over to
the Grinnell lSPiRGaccount A large
portion of the total revenue will be
sent to the state office to pay for

gatlon in which ISPIRG is involved.

Pro Musica Concert Concern

by Brent Schcndelmeyer

Student concern over the ticket distribution procedures tor last
Friday’s pro Muslca Concert and the after-concert reception held
in Grinnell House has recently turned the question into a signiiicant
campus issue. The Student Coordinator’s omce is preparing a re
port dealing with the specincs oi the matter, and the public Events
Committee will also be issuing a report soon.

The concert was the first event under the new public Events Come
mittee, reestablished here last year, The committee is tunded with
$8,000 at student funds and $6,000 train the administration. The money
was budgeted last year to cover both the iirsl and second semesters.

The demand tor tickets to the pro Musica’s perlormance lar exr
ceeded the Committee's expectations. students began their vigil
around the Forum desk at 10:30 a in, last Tuesday, the day oi ticket
distribution, and because at the use oi multiple ID cards (up to four
in some cases) the ticket supply dwindled rapidly, Seating capacity
of Roberts Theater is 424, pt these, 75 tickets were allotted to the
iaculty. Approximatly 350 tickets were available to students, there
fore: enough to cover less than a third of the student body,

Student grievances also included the fact that the taculty had a separ
rate line for tickets and its expediency may have allowed them to
have a better choice oi seats The reserved seats were taken by
12 45, and unreserved seats and standing room seats were distributed
thereafter. Approximately 25730 students were admitted at the time
or the concert without tickets; the crowd was the largest ever in
Roberts Theater,

Following the pertormance a reception was held at Grinnell House.
invitations were sent late Friday to around 25 lnculty members and
25 students, who were either music and theater students or members
of the son cabinet, The pertormers were not aware or the reception
until they arrived on campus late Friday utternoon.

a waitress and bartender were hired tor the reception, which was
tunded out of an incidental fund of the public Events Committee
which totals $400. The fund is planned to include the cost of printing
programs, piano tuning, stage work, equipment moving and recep~
tions The cost oi this particular reception has been placed at $1257
150.

The college has long held a policy ot not permitting student funds
to be used tor the purchase oi alcoholic beverages.

Economics protessor John Dawson, Chairman ot the public Events
Committee, told the 3&3 this week that he hoped that the good general
idea would not be abandoned because ot a number or minor details.
it has been, he stated, the clear policy or the committee to serve
the whole college community and it would continue to be so
The next event for the Public , ents Committee will be on November
18 teaturing lndian Dance by Mamusi Chakl—Sli‘ciir There will be
one perlormance

A smaller portion will remain to
fund local lSPIRG projects, such as
the research currently being con-
ducted on local rental Conditions.
The college will also be payed tor
the bookkeeping expenses incurred
in the operation According to
ISPIRG officials this arrangement
with the college ascollection agency
will not endanger the taXrexempt
status of the school,

The independent nature of the
-PIRG was emphasized throughout
the groups presentation. Four other
schools in Iowa-down State Unis
versity, Coe College, Central Cole
lege, and Simpson Collegev—have
institued similar tuition checkvoff
plans. In each case care has been
taken that the school not become in-
volved in the activities ofthe organ-
ization, but only aCt as a paid
collection agency, carrying out the
desires of the students in this field
The ISPIRG statement alsopointed
out that this was the most effective
method available tor gaining fundv
ing; individual collections every
semester would be too time cons
suming for local staff members and
volunteers. Aso, the tuition check»
off method provides the groups with
a more stable source of income than
other methods or collection might
provide,

An easy mechanism is provided
in the ISPIRG proposal for stu~
dents who wish to have the money
refunded. Three weeks after regir
stration tables will be set foraweek
long period up in convenient loca-
tions around Campus, Students wish-
ing to get their money simply have
to sign their name on a check-off
list at one of the tables. Refunds
will then be made by check through
the college Treasurer’s otiice.

The measure must be approved by
the Trustees in November before it
becomes olfiCial,
