Blacks Commundeer Room In Burling

20th Century Room Taken,
Made Into Black Library

Thirty to forty black students and History and American Studies
professor Virginius Thornton deshelved books in Burling library‘s
Twentieth Century Room last evening and moved most of the black
studies books in Burling onto the shelves.

Shortly after a joint meeting of the Executive Council and the
Women’s Search Committee, the students, assisted by a few white
students, began moving the regular collection ot current books
and selected hound periodicals from the room, to make room for

Thornton Sees Racism

by Don nsgenais

Dissatisfaction Di Grinnell blacks
which culminated last night in the
takeover ol the library‘s 20th Cen»
turn Room has apparently been br-
ewing under the surface since last
semester. In an interview with the
8&8 last week, Virginius Thornton
111, History and American studies,
indicated dissatsitaction on the part
of the black community with the 3d,
ministration’s treatment of last
semester’s list of demands.

‘The administration apparently
negotiated in bad faith," Thornton
said, noting that they used stalling
tactics to ‘—get the black students
back to classes, and go back to
business as usual."

‘-'Il the school were responsible,
it would have organized a task force
to analyze the cause of the black
unrest last semester. But Grinneii
is not committed to doing this; it
is mostly Just interested in public
relations. What has been done with
the black library indicates how the
administration is willing to deal with
black people.”

The library, Thornton teels, would
be an aid to the education oi Grin-
nell’s whites as well as a service
to the black community. White lnr
tellectuals do not read the large body
or black literature and thereiore do
not understand the true situation of
the black man in this country. “No
white intellectual can be ligitimate
unless he sees things from otherthnn
the colonial perspective. We are a
part oi the total American commun-
lty.”

Thornton leels that the various
Black Studies courses here are lud—
icrous; they do not survey the subs
iect matter adequately “because or
ignorance and racism.” because oi
the “invisibility olblncks,” the pros

tessors are miseducnted about the i

very Subjects they are supposed to
teach. “This is the kind of racism
that aided Hitler in the 1930’s.”
Thornton also complains about the
Search Committee procedures which
“fuse the Search [or black and wo-
men [acuity members. This is an
insult to the blacks. No one should
be hired unless they (”'6 qualitied
and n black person.” Furthermore

in; school is unwilling to pay black
iaculty members -he salaries they
must be paid in .~~der to get them
here. Thornton suggests that the
school look in the black community
itsell ior quuiiiicd proressors, whee

ther they have the Pit, D’s or not.

“We have one basic question,”
Thornton said, “Why are black pens
pie here at crinnelli What is it
doing [or black people"" orinncll
reiniorces the stigma olhiack in-
iei-iorily and reiniorces the white
ieeling oi superiority, Thornton nor
ted, and ii the school does not her
come more responsible to the needs
oi the black students the blacks here
may simply leave "Timeis running
out. We can go somewhere else
where our brothers and sisters need
us instead of wasting loiir years
here. i came to Grinnell out or a
sense oi commitment, but 1 may
leave it because oi a lack oi conie
mitmcnt here,"

“The black students here are
reaching out against a system that
is racist the and it takes many
muniiest' Thornton said
“The black revolution doc-s not mean
stomping white people in the race,
but the institution o1 nudity in Ameri-
can lite.”

Carolyn Reid Wallace Is
Center Of Controversy

Carolyn Redi—Wallace, Adjunct assistant prolessor or English at
Howard University, who gave a lecture here January 25, has been
under consideration ior next year's opening in the English depart
ment. according to Virginius Thornton, History and American Stus

dies.
Mr. Thornton told the sun that primarily because olopposition

to Mrs. Reid—Wallace iroin women iaculty members here and
because or constant checking and rechecking oers. ReideWallace’s
credentials, she will probably not come here next year

This may have been a central reason lora lot at the recent connict
on campus, Mr. Thornton said.

Mrs, ReideWallace is independently wealthy and she is currently
teaching tor tree at Howard; her salary is gomg directly into a
trust iund ior scholarships ior law students.

A major point or contention among people here was apparently
the salary she would make, When she was here, she gave the iigure
or $18,000 as a negotiable iigure tor a salary.

However, she would have given the college $10,000 oi her salary
tor a scholarship iund [or black students even it the salary were
negotiated to as low as $12,000 Thornton Said,

What many people here do not realize, Thornton told the see, is
not there is a “a growing nuinher at young black prolessionals
who will plnw back a lot or money ior scholarships for biack stile
dents.”

Mrs. ReideWallace talked to many people here last month, and
she was persuaded by them to apply iorthe English opening, Thorn-
ton said.

Thornton said that she is already giving a “professional input"
into the college; liitecn to twenty students have already written
her [or help and advice on diiierent kinds or projects they are
doing, and she has replied and given them suggestions.

Mrs. Wallace is a dedicated scholar who was sincerely interested
in coming to Grinnell, Thornton said, and it would have beeha
great opportunity for Gl'innell is she had come.

The “nonsense” and double and triple checking oi her creden-
tials, and the doubts expressed by some iaculty here, however,
have almost persuaded her to go instead to Germany or lndia to
teach next year, he said.

“We have blown the opportunity," Tharntonsaid .. and the reasons
that has happened have been a very central point or contention oi
students and iacuity in the last weeks.

“Please remove yourselves iroin
the Twentieth Century Room so we
may close the doors within five min-
utes or i shall have to , , ,deem
this preventing the availability or
certain curriculum," Walker said.

Mr. Thornton told students to stay
in the room for at least tour-and
one-halt minutes, but all students did
leave and Walker and head librarian
Henry Alden locked the doors.

Walker told some black students as
they were leaving the library that
he really didn't mean to be so
hardenosed about it, that itwas very
smart oi them to do it, and that he
really admired their courage [or
doing so.

All black Students lelt the library
by 11:00 p m., and shortly there»
alter began a general meeting atthe'
Black Cultural Center.

Thornton spoke with the Silk! seve-
ral times during the evening, and in-
dicated that he and the black stu-
dents “might have to be ordering
a bus to all leave over the weekend,
which would be good strategy, and
that makes nice TV coverage. Six-
ty black students leaving would make
5:30 to 6:30 news around thenation.”

“That sure isn't what we want,"
he said. “But it it takes that to
make certain people to do certain
things, then we'll have to do it."

Asked what things in partiuclar he
was reiering to, Thornton replied,
"to make the administration andthe
luculty honor its committmentto get
black faculty and to implement the
Black Manifesto which was negOA
tiated "

The action or transiormihg the
Twentieth Century Room into the
black Studies library followed two
recent meetings with the library
