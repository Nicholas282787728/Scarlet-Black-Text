by Curt Gorrell

The Grinnell sports fan was treated
to a victory over Lawrence, 7353,
and a hotly contested, close deieatto
Ripon, 77-70, in basketball action
played last weekend here at Darby
Gym.

The opening event of the weekend's
doubleheader was scheduled against
the Vikings, who succumbed in a
game which demonstrated a new balr
ance in the Pioneers scoring attack.
Bob Burnett led the way with 22
points, while Dennis Moss con
tributed 18; Jeff Jensen, [5; and
Chuck Patterson, 12. Patterson was
also strong on the boards with 15
rebounds. Although not tightly
played, the Pioneers hit one hot
streak in the match to establish their
feed, and then maintained with com-
posure until the end.

The Grinnell / RlpDn tilt was per-
haps one oi the best basketball perv
formances all Season The Ripon
Redmen, who trail only onerhalf
game behind conference leading St.
olal, brought a powerhouse to the
floor. conducting the most potent

Win Again

by Chris Madsnn

If there had been a second team
on Grinnell's bench, they would have
gotten their chance in the second half
of the track meet here last Thursday.
Unfortunately for Central, William
Penn, Parsons, Simpson, and Knox,
only the firstrstring Grinnell
runners were on hand. The result
was a forty-[our point,vlctory for
the Grinnell CollegerPoweshiek
County International Track Club.

Chuck McGrath staged a fantastic
exhibition (of running) to lead the
team to the win. He started with a
leisurely 11:30.8 mile for his first
victory, then came back to win the
1000 yard run and the two-mile,
Five minutes after the end of the
two-mile, Chuck was on the track
again, waiting tor the baton tor the
last leg of the two-mile relay, He
got the baton and took off down the
track, about seventy yards behind
the tirst-place Penn runner, but
when he came into sight on the hack
stretch, the Penn man's lead had
dwindled to thirty yards, He over
powered the leader on the last turn,
striding to his tourth Victory of the
day with a {me 2045 half-mile
time, What can you say?

There were two other standouts
in the competition, Phil Morales and
Dave Wright. Phil won the 660 for
the second straight time and put a
scorching finish on the miie relay,
running his 440 in 53.3, by far the
best quarterrmile ever run on the
new track,

Dave Wright quietly won both the
long jump and the triple yump with
leaps oi 20'8” and 41’,respectively,

The rest Of the mob held up their
end, too, Barry Huff threw the shot
49’2" for a second, and Jon Gray
took a second in the thryard high
hurdles. Jim Pirolli went 5’8“ in
the high jump tor a second, Chris
Madson won the vault again, and
Dan Hildebrand set a new personal
record with his secondrplace chart
in the twoemile. Other solid per-
formances included Paul Miller’s
tourth place finishes in the mile
and 880 and John Hessburg’s third
place in the 1000,

The winning streak now stands
at two victories, and the Scorch»
therTarian Gang will be out to add
two more wins on February l7 and
25. Join the cast of thousands at
the next track Orgy at the Physical
Education Complex, get high on
sports...

The Scarlet and Black

Win, lose

offensive attack in the league, But,
not phased in the least by this or
memories of the loss sustained at
Ripon the week before, the pioneers
went out to simply play one line ball
game. Teamwork was again the key-
stone to their ottense, with four play-
ers hatching double figures: Burr
nett, Bill Bowers, Moss, and Jensen
hitting for 20,14. 13.and12,respec-
tively. Ripon held a one point lead at
hall time, and totaled a victory mar»
gin oi out seven points With health
returned and experience accumula-
ting, tlte Pioneers are turning out
strong, respectable efforts in their
late season endeavors.

Tomorrow, as Grinnell plays host
to Cornell in Darby Gym, the spot
light will be focused upon Bob Bur-
nett, the conference's third leading
scorer, who registered 42 points
last weekend to up his career total
to 999 points For those not mather
matically inclined, this means that
Burnett's first basket tomorrow

afternoon will place him in the relar
tively exclusive tour tigure club or
1,000-pllls points.

The Grinnell swim team [aces its
last big test before the Midwest Cone
ference meet with a contest Saturday
against Carelton, Coe, Cornell,
and St. Olaf. The meet is scheduled
ior 1,30 at the P E: Complex pool,

The contest, to be scored as a 4-
way dual, could extend the Pioneers'
victory string to 35, but the come
petition will be tough. Cornell, Coe,
and Carelton all finished in the first
division at conference last year and
reportedly Carleton has an excellent
team this year.

Victory number Zl Came tothe 5w,
immel‘s last Saturday in a splash-
off with Monmouth which the Scarlet
and Bale swam away with bya score
of 75-23. Despite several cases of flu
and sore throats, the aqua—jocks
won eleven of thirteen events.

Gabby Ward turned in an outstand»
ing periormance in the 200 yard in-
dividual medley, setting a pool recs
ord and tieing the record in the 9V,
out with a time of 2,12 6. Jim
Carns took both the 50 and 100
yard freestule and Mark Williams
won the 200 yard freestyle and the

Portrait Of

by Sigi M.

Almost unique to Grinnell's
history, Mario Bognanno is cone
currently a student, an athlete, and
the coach of Grinnell’s wrestling
team, Besides being a political sci-
ence major and president at the c
of HP, he is also a line athlete,
excelling in both footballandwrest-
ling

This year has provided a new
opportunity tor Mario; now he can
look at sports from the other end
or the bench. Although coaching a
wrestling team like Grinnell’s could
become depressing, Mario regards
his new position as a greatchallenge.
He has worked diligently with his
wrestlers, trying to build strength
and finesse. AS he sees the Individr
ual wrestler improve, he realizes
that maybe he provided the reinr
lorcement, the impetus, for this
improvement. To Marlo this is one
of the greatest rewards a coach can
have.

Mario's interscholastic wrestling
career began at Des Moines East
High School, As a junior he took
second in the city and third in the
district at 165 pounds His last high
school wrestling season was hamr
percd by a knee inyury which he in,
curred during iootbhll, and he was
only able to wrestle one varsity
meet,

His competitive wrestling career
had to end in high scllool because of
his bad lett knee. Not giving up
wrestling, Marlo became Coach
Hunt’s manager and tried to impart
his knowledge of wrestling to the
fledgling athletes.

Mario also hopes that Coaching will
become an integral part oi his fu-
ture, Alter he graduates with a cer
tiiicnte in secondary education, he

butterfly Acrobatic Pete Bernstein
continued to dominate the diving.

Other Grinnell firsts came from
Bob Brown, Tom Rowat, and Bo
Bob Brown, Tom Rowat, and Bob
Winters in the 1000 freestyle. 500
freestyle, and 200 backstroke res—
pectively.

This meet showed the versatility
and depth of the squad, wpth sev-
eral swimmers entered in events
other than their speciality. The
competition will be vastly tough—
er tomorrow and at the conference
meet, but everything continues to
look bright for Coach Obermiller's
charges,

Tomorrow’s meet is the last one
at home this season for the Pio—
neers, who have only the traditional
dual meet at Cornell before the
battle for «Dilly the Duck” at the
conference meet in twoweeks. Come
in out of the snow tomorrow to bask
in the Warmth and humidity of the
swimming pool and help the team’s
two mascots, Buddha and Mike Dal~
ey’s boa constrictor, bring a big
win to the team.

A Cooclt

Offenbach

hopes to teach social studies and
become a wrestling and football
coach at some Des Moines high
school. Later he Wants to continue
his education either in law or in
industrialrlabor relations.

Maria has a short message to col-
lege students. ”Athletics Should be
an important part of everyone’s de,
velopment. Besides building a healv
thy body, sports pmvideagreatout-
let [or tension and help to develop
a more well»rounded personality."

Although our wrestling team has
been tar from successiul, this
week’s match may provide some
surprises. Coach Bognanno indi-
cates that two new men will be on
the mat for us, and we can expect
great things from them.
