88:3 POLITICAL
SURVEY

h’y John Wylie

Although he Still maintains an overwhetme
mg lead at Grinneil, George McGovern’s
credibility was shattered by his handling of
the Eagleton affair according to a political
survey conducted here by the 8&5 thisweek.

while only a handiul of the 400 respondents
to the survey indicated that they planned to
vote against McGovern or to abstain in
November, 50% sa1d that they had heen 9t-
iected by the aiiair. A huge majority cl
these commented that their belieiin George
McGovern as an idealist had been ruined.

A senior summed up this ieeling this
way: “it (the Eagleton Affair) proved
McGovern was a rat ~— but less of a one

than Nixon.” .
More than 90% oi the students indicated

their intentions to vote, and more than 35%
planned to vote in Iowa. Included in that
figure are 26% of Grinneil’s out of state

Students who plan to forsake homeestate
races in favor oi Iowa politics.

Recently, most local attention has been
locused 0n the race {or United States
Representative in the newly reapportioned
First Congressional District between
Democrat Edward Mezvinsky and Re
publican incumbent Fred Schwengel.

As expected, Mezvinsky is currently out
polling Schwengel bya substantial mare
gin » but almost 30% of the respondents
indicated that they Wanted to learn more
about the two Candidates before making a
linal decision in the race

The war in indochina was listed as the
most important issue in the campaign by
more than 60% of the respondents .2 vastly
outstripping the second most mentioned
issue, the economy, issues such as race
relations and Women’s Rights, which might
be expected to be important in the Grin-
nell community, were mentioned by only
{our and seven percent, respectively, oi
the respondents.

However, in striking contrast to the Eagle-
toi'l Affair, the Watergate aiiair, involving
Top Republicans in an attempted hugging or
Democratic National Headquarters, seems
to have caused few changes in political
thinking.

Less than one quarter of the respondents
indicated that the incident had affected their
thinking. A typical comment came from a
sophomore who noted, ”It was really what
I expected from this Administration, al-
thoughll didn’t really expect them to be so
heavy handed about it.”

Politicians looking for workers should
find an ample stock on the campus - 22%
of the students and 44% of their instruc—
tors indicated their tentative intention to
work in the Presidential contest. Smaller
numbers also planned to participate in lo-
cal races, either in iowa or their home
states.

Students also maintained their indepen-
dence — almost hall of the students res-
ponding to the survey classified them-
selves as independents rather than owing
allegiance to either political party.
