Commercial Road: Argent’s ‘All Together Now’

by Scott Mason

It is a sad fact that most people’s
exposure to Argent will be through
their AM single, “Hold Your Head
Up,” or through their latest LP
”All Together Now." A sad fact has
cause Argent is capable of much
iiner work, as shown by their tirst
two albums. Their latest efforts are
obviously aimed at gaining a wider
audience, and their work suffers
because of it
After the Zombies ("Time of the
Season,” ”She's Not There") broke
up in 1965, their organist, Rod AY~
gent formed his own band. Includr
ing Russ Ballard on guitar, drummer
Robert Henrit, and bassist Jim Rod-
l'ord, the bands first LP” Argent
remains a masterpiece of British
rock.

Combining both instrumental and
vocal skill, Argent also boasts fine
composing. At a time when so many
rock bands seem to write according
to a pre-set formula, Argent is a
refreshing change. Unlike many

vocal bands who base their harr
monies on folk and country roots,
Argent plays rock and roll of the
most intelligent kind. Theirintricate
vocal harmonies soar over a solid
electric background; each songisan
experience in itselt. it you can
imagine an updated Zombies with
classical training but strong rock/
blues roots, you’d have a roughidea
of what Argent is up to.

Their second album, Ring ofHands
extends the concepts originated on
Argent. The songs are longer, andif
anything, more complex. Extensive
instrumental breaks give both
Argent and Ballard a cllancetoshow
their prowess, while the vocals

remain nothing less than amazing,
Argeht’s three part crossing har-
monies, intelligent lyrics andentire
musical outlook are approached only
by Year, another fine English band,
Witness “Lothlorien” or "Pleas
sure" on Ring of Hands as tes-
timony to an altogether tine band.

A year and a half elapsed between
Ring of Hands andAilTogetherNow,
and a dollar sign musthave appeared
in the air to turn Argent's head
around. This latest effortis marked
by anattemptatmarketahle “heavy”
music that goes againstthe direction
marked by the first two albums.
Gone are ninety percent of the vocal
harmonies, to be replaced by
screaming “lead” singing. Rod Ar-
gent's intricate organ solos seem
out of place against a dull rhyth—
mlc background, andBailard'smoVr
ing bass lines are now thumping,
repetitive patterns.

Not unsurprisingty, ”Hold Your

Head Up" is the first song on the
album. It is identical to the AM
radio version except for the inclu—
sion of an extended organ solo.
Even Rod Argent’s well constructed,
quasi-classical work Eils to get
the hideously dull rhythmic pattern
on the ground.

"Keep On Rollin’ " shows thatRod
Argent is certainly one oi the iinest
keyboard men in rock. His piano
introduction is an interesting and
technically demanding combination
of stride and contemporary blues
piano styles, However, the rest of
the song falls into a commonplace
blues/rock number.

“Tragedy," a Russ Ballard com-

Ode to an Aging Women's Gym

On a day not soon forgotten

Though the ﬂoors were hardly rotten
Like the deed or God at Sodom

Through the crashing of timber and the whining of saws
Our president’s words could be heard--sans applause
”Let the gym be destroyed!" he bellows and roars.

The cost to rerurbish might have been great
Does none pity a colossus long out of date?
But why not leave standing--though not to operate?

But, alas, our please are naught, it is too late

”Nay, nay,” Quoth Leggett,

So now let us pray to Zeus,

“So the students are irate?”

almighty God:

May the ghosts or gymnasts long beneath the sod
stampede through his dreams and by them be he trod.

is vaguely rememscentoisome Hen-
drix work from the Cry of Love
album. It is one of the better cuts
on the record but lacks the delicate
quality of their earlier work.

“I Am the Dance of Ages” con-
cludes Side one, It suffers trom
much.the same problem as “Hold
Your Head Up,” the song is held
back by a dull bass/drum pattern
that masquerades as “heavy”
music.

Side Two opens with “Be My Lover,
Be My Friend,” another rocker.
Though one of the better tunes, it
still isn't in the same class as,
say, “Chained’hfrom Ring ofHands.
"He’s A Dynamo” is another Ballard
composition, Ballard seems best
to have adapted himself to Argent’s
new “hard rock” format, Like
"Tragedy,” ”Dynamo” trucks
along, and has interesting lyrics.

Side Two ends with an extended
piece, “Pure Love.“ It begins with
live minutes ot organ solo in a
romantic vein, which is nice enough
but not what you buy an Argentalbum
for. Franck and Brahms did this
sort of thing for better about a
hundred years ago. The organ solo
develops into an Emerson, Lake.
and Palmerish instrumental, which
finally settles into a dissonant, ex
tended blues pattern, complete with
wailing vocals and screaming guitar.
A structured classical climax sup-
plies the conclusion.

Evidentally the commercial road
is not without advantageSrrArgent
toured with Jeff Beck this summer,
hitting all the major cities in the
us. The last time i saw them they
were playing incredible music in
some wretched club in Northhruok,

Things certainly were different

all their heavies at high Volume,
Russ Ballard rubbed his guitaralong

Grinnell lacks Intellectual

by Gregg Donner

What this college (and this county)
desperately needs to save it from
intellectual bankruptcy is intellec-
tual diversity. Specilically, it is
dying irom lack of strong, con-
sistent, rational thinking.

The purpose at Grinnell should and
must be to foster rational intelleCr
tual independence in its students.
The proper function of the Adminis—
tration is to maintain the economics
of running the college (including
specifically the physical environ-
ment) and setting the general crir
terion (or hiring professors
as well as maintaining the highest
quality of professionalism. The term

However Reason, Objectivity, Con—
sistency (both within a system of
ideas and between those ideas and
reality) are concepts seemingly be
yond the scope or many pl'ofessors'

should be the study or truth through
the guidance and leadership of the

This column is dedicated to the
advocacy of Reason and consequently
the intellectual polarization of this

Qualifications

by Jim Alt

For those who didn‘t notice, my
tirst column appeared two weeks
ago. There were a lot of you.

For those who did notice, I'd like
to reply to certain of your ques
tions. Although these queries take
two general formsrsthose insulting
my writing, and those insulting me
personally--they all boil down to a
single question. Namely, ”Alt, what
the hell are you doing writing a
political column,"

When both your editor and your
political science advisor ask this.
it can become a little deflating.

Nevertheless, I am uniquely quali-
tied for the job. I am the only per.
son who did not turn it down. In
addition to meeting that Vital re
quirement, my range of experience
is unequaled on this campuseeand
this, gang, is for real.

l once listened to eight continuous
hours of debate on the floor of the
Iowa House of Representatives. My
assignment was to wake up my state
representative whenever a vote was
called. I only oozed off twice.

I have met Richard Turner, Robert
Ray, and Harold Hughes, once each.
None of them wanted to meet me
again.

I have been in the tavern Where
Ronald Reagan used to drink when he
was a spurtscaster in Des Moines.
Sadly, this landmark was demolished
shortly before he was elected gov-
ernor of California

I have been active in many election
campaigns. l worked once for a
school board candidate and twice
for a state representative. I am
highly skilled at distributing hands
bills, licking envelopes, putting up
campaign signs, and tearing down
campaign signs. Especially oppon—
ents' campaign signs.

I have taken political science
courses. I passed all six. 1 am also
enrolled in Hottois' course “Elect-
ing a President," which qualities me
as an expert . . .despite what Hots
tois tells you.

I can explain with a straight face
why the conservative Republican
candidate for lieutenant governor of

Iowa backed abortion reform in his
primary campaign, while his liberal

I am a Student of Objectivism, a
philosophy founded and expounded by
Ayn Rand. lwili state now once and
for all future articles that l, as
indicated by the word “student”,
am just that and as such speak only
for myselt--my view of reality and
my interpretation of Objectivism

However I will, at times, indicate
specitic concepts and theories of
Miss Rand’s philosophy which are
especially important to my own
ldezls. For these as well as those
concepts implicit in my writing
which Miss Rand introduced me to,
I have the greatest esteem and the
deepest gratitude. to short, the Ob-
jectlvist metaphysics, epistemology
and ethics are the philosophical
frame of reference in which I write.

enables me to maintain strict 0b,
jectivity while taking shots, cheap
and otherwise, at all political
groups, This also saves me from
having to vote in the iowa primary
which, as shown above, can become
a little coutuslng,

I am the only person i know who
has read the John Birch SOCiety’s
book None Dare Call It Conspiracy.
i also spent a number at stimulating
hours this summer talking with a
real, live Birch Society supporter.
I am saving the details for a later
column, but it should suffice to say
that she called me, in all serious
ness, a “pinko”, This Should amuse
my fellow political scientists, who
generally refer to me as ”that reac-
tionary”. If not worse.

I am also the only person lknow
who has been selected in a state-
wide randum sample of political ate
titudes, I did Very well up to the
question: “which do you preter,
racism or violence""

I have read the ”Des Moines Res
gister", the paper that depends on
all Iowa, since I was six. [believe
in the conventional wisdom that the
“Register’s” endorsement of a cane
didate is his political kiss of death.
I have also read Dori Kaul since he
came to Des Moines and even think
that he is tuuny—-occasionally,

And really, that is about any
columnist can hope forrrthat some
one occasionally thinks he is funny,
or provocative, or even correct.
Looking back over my qualitications,
all of which are genuine, I have
decided that the question I started
to answer is a pretty fair question.

But the fact remains that I am
writing this and, as long as the
insults keep coming, that someone
is reading it. And yes, i might

oneself to others. The highest moral
action consists otpursuing one’s own
rational self-interest for ones own
happiness.

D, Pure unrestricted iaissezrtaire
Capitalism is the only systemwhere
men voluntarily deal with each other
as traders, for their mutual bene»
Ilt. It is a system founded on the
moral principal that man’s only ob-
ligation to others is a negative one--
ND MAN MAY INITIATE PHYSICAL
FORCE AGAINST ANOTHER MAN.

As such the sole purpose of moral
government is the protection of its

citizens from acts which violate this
principle. Hence it would defend in-
dividuals from criminals, both with—
in and outside of the country, It's
perhaps best known and least under»
stood as the only political-economic
system which totally separates Gov.
ernment and Economics in the same
way as its separates Governmentand
the Church.

Value is that which one acts to
gain and/or keep. Throughout hiSr
tory phllosophet‘s have generally
either taken the existence of ethics
tor granted or asked as their tirst
question--What should man value?
The fact that man should value some
thing was presupposed, But because
it was never objectively proven nor
even made demonstrably explicit
that man must choose to have ra-
tional morality in order to live, the
kind of moralities which developed
did not satisty any such need

Next week I shall demonstrate the
need for obtertive etllics and the
nature of obtective absolute ethics.
