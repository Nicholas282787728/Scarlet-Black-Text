Too Much For Too Little?

Several years ago, the students of Grinnell were presented
with a student referendum proposition with a difference: it
concerned the possible abolishment of student government at
the college. Such a proposal, despite the fact that it did not
pass (narrowly) carries ominous implications, for the fact
that students at the college considered seriously the pro-
position that we have no student government carries with it
the implicit suggestion that we could get along without one.

This, to present members of the SGA Cabinet, is a fright-
ening concept; it is rather like suddenly discovering that you
have been vigorously throwing water in a bucket in ignorance
of the hole in the bottom. Certainly we would not advocate
that point of view, at least not without serious review of the
situation, but the fact remains that from an examination of
the importance of student government at Grinnell we have
everything to gain and nothing to lose.

The issue is of particular concern at this time of year for
another reason: the SGA budget approved last Wednesday
designates that $2,350 will he spent this year for salaries
of SGA personnel (the SGA President, VicerPresidents, Stu—
dent Coordinator, SGA Secretary, and Coordinator‘s Assis-
tants), up $925 from last year. The total is $300 higher than
the previous record (during the 1970771 school year) and, as
the Student Auditor’s Office has pointed out, accounts for
more than half of the unfortunate deficit which appears in this

year’s budget. _
With this amount of money involved, the question becomes

not only: should student government exist? but also: even if

it should, is it worth that kind of money?

The functions of a student government remain undefined, but
supposedly we consider it necessary to have student governr
ment leaders in order that the campus have some source
of instant leadership should campus-wide issues arise. The
problem, then is justifying the existence of a student govern-
ment during those long invbetween-crisis times and deter-

mining to what extent they» can exercise leadership in the-

months when they are not specifically handed the opportunity
to do so.

As a case in point we may take SGA President Russ Mc-
Gregor. When he was elected to the office last spring, Mc-
Gregor began his tenure as SGA President actively, calling
an all-college ”evaluatory meeting" asking for better com-
munication between the administration, SGA, and students.

Now, however, times are quieter and criseshot so pre-
valent in Campus lite, and with Vice-Presidents Pfeffer and
Walter doing much of the legwork of SGA, the performance
of McGregor becomes more difficult to evaluate. Is the fact
that the students see and hear little of him evidence lthat he
id doing little? We would not suggest so without further eval-
uation, but the fact that such a question exists indicates the
extent of the problem.

in essence, the students must have a more visible kind of
leadership from SGA Cabinet members before they can have
a basis upon which to judge student government performance.
Unless the students can see such a role, they can only judge
upon what they know now, which is very little.

And the leadership problem is only the first step, for once
students have a basis upon which to judge student government
leadership, the evaluation must be made else we continue to
devote considerable time and money to an activity which per-
petuates itself on inertia alone.

Perhaps that referendum of a few years back was not such
a bad idea. Maybe we should have another one, perhaps one in
a long series of similar proposals which should be introduced
once every two or three years. Then we would see if the student
government can rise to the occasion and successfully defend

its existence. . .

College Pub Vote

The planning for a Grinnell pub began this summer when SGA
ViceePresident John Pfeffer began looking illto the legal ime
plications of the idea. After conferences with the adminis—
tration revealed the possibility of a campus pub here, Pfeffer
has this semester introduced the idea to the students. Some
decision must he made fairly soon, since approval by the
Trustees in early November would be required. Both of the
Deans and President Leggett are, the 5&B has been assurred,
neutral on the matter.

The opinion poll to be conducted on Tuesday gives students
their first real chance to have organized input into this process.
Since a pub on campus has economic and social implications
of concern to all students whether or not they will plan to use
it, we urge the student body to carefully consider the matter
before voting. The issue is not a minor one; the consequences
may affect social life at Grinnell for years to come.

I am quite puzzled as to thesudden

wouldn’t be students

Perhaps ii I had the inside scoop

To the Editors:

Approximately three weeks agothe
Office Of the Dean of Student Afr
fairs released its “annual" memory
andum concerning the collegepolicy
of pets in the residence halls. As
in the past, the Denns' requests were
regarded witll the usual indifference
on the part of the student body,
Each year, a small minority of stu—
dents arrive on campus with pets
from home, and, after :l week or
two, a new explosion at puppies and
kittens takes place on campus as
more surrendertothe innocent looks
pl young pets belonging to their
dorm»mates. The number of pets on
campus has increased rapidly in the
two years that l have been at Grin-
nell, and I Sincerely doubt that the
grounds around the college buildings
can continue to support the rising
animal population.

Following a great deal of debate,
the Social Policies and Regulations
Cpmmittee of last year decided that
it would reinstate the pet policy of
the previous year as it appeared
to be the most reasonable in terms
of the entire college community.

Within the next lcw weeks, the Stu-
dent Government Association will be
l‘esevaluating the presentpet policy,
hopefully with the intent to enforce
the regulations it encompasses,

The most frequently henrd are
gumenl in defense of pet ownership
is the idea that everyone has the
“right" to own all animal as long
as such ownership does not infringe
upon the rights of others. Many
students this year have attempted
to prove that their animal is not
“infringing on tile rights of others”
by taking individual hall and/or floor
votes, asking hall members whether
or not they would mind having pets
made “legal" within the designated
hall. The owner must realize, how-
ever, that in such situations hall-
mates do not want to refuse anyone
their desire to have a pet to Which
they are already attached, and so,
it is not difficult to obtain the res
qull‘ed majority of signatures or
votes

oftentimes, such a deClsion is re
gretted by hall members a few weeks
later, at which time the owner re-
fuses to part with a pet, lo which
he has become attached such the
stances frequently lend to unneces-
sary dissensioll within the hall, or
personal problems on the iloor,
The major inllacy inherent intlle
“hallrvote” system is the Izlct that
pets are rarely restricted to that
hall alone (and when they are, tlle
animal's “rights" muslulsobe cone
sidered). Consequently pets roam iii
and out of hall washrooms and
