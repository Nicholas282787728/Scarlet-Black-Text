[M's Return To Hail Concept

in an SLB slat! it up

intramural lootball teams, which
will begin play on Monday, Septemr
ber ll, will be organized around
the hall concept this year as has
been the custom in preVious years,
intramural Chairman Tim Goldbull
told the SM? Tuesday. Goldbutl and
members ol the Physical Education
department had originally planned
to organize the teams on the basis
ot a “draﬂ” or interested students,
but decided last Saturday to re
turn to hall-centered teams

The idea of the dratt developed
last Spring lrom discussions about
the problems oi intramural sports
on Campus, The advent ol coedus
cational halls, Goldbull said, had
made it necessary in many cases
to combine several halls in order
to come up with enough interested
players to form a team, but be-
cause oi “communication difficul-
ties” the plan was not working well.
Last Spring members ol the Phys-
ical Education department and stu-
dents interested in intramural
sports had decided to create a new
system whereby students would sign
up tor intramural sports during Reg~
istratipn and then be dralted lrom
a master list by ten team captains
who had volunteered to head the
teams. Last Saturday when the ten
captains met to dralt the teams,
they decided to return to the ball-
