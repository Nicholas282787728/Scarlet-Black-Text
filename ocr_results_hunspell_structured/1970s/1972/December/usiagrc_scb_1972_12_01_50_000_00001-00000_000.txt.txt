Faculty Reverses
. Committee Policy

by Ann Cassel

On Tuesday, November 21, in a
room filled to capacity with faculty
and Students, the faculty reversed its
decision oi November 6 concerning
closed committee meetings. The
previous resolution, which passed
25-13, read “Faculty standingcom-
mittee meetings shall not be open
to non—members, whether student or
iaculty, except by invitation of the
committee.”

Before reconsideration of thepro-
posal was discussed, President Legs
gett urged that the faculty not take
an “inordinately great amount oi
time" in discussion of the issue

Peter Bodunrin, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Classics, moved that the
faculty reconsider the previous res
solution, Stating that he had voted in
favor of the motion at the last meet-
ing due to the “logic or one of my
colleagues in philosophy, the absurr
dity of which I did not see at that
time.” He went on to dusouss the
requests of a “particular interest
group" during the last academic
year which included being allowed
to sit in on committee meetings
They were lold at that time that no
action need be taken on this request
as committee meetings were gene
erally openr Bodunrin alsomention-
ed that students in committee meete
lngs should not inhibit, but sharpen
discussion, citing that the large
number of students present during
the faculty meeting caused him to
think more about what he had plan-
ned to say concerning reconsidr
eration.

Anne Abler, Instructor in Soc-
iology, and Robert Grey, Assistant
Professor of Political Science, both
urged reconsideration because dithe

Small number Of faculty present and
voting at the last meeting.

Russell McGregor, President of the
Student Government Association,
and Barry Zlgas, All-Campus EPC
representative, also urged a vote
for reconsideration by citing student
opposition to the previous vote.

The faculty voted to reconsider
the motion 43-154,

Robert Voertman, Professor of Ecs
onomics, and William Oelke, Pros
lesser of Chemistry, spoke in favor
of the previous resolution. Voertman
stated that Grinnell is not run as
a citizen’s state but as a bureaus
cratlc institution and such decisions
should be made on the basis of this
assumption. The question oi rights,
according to Voertman, was not a
matter for consideration. Oelke
mentioned that outsiders impede the
decision making process and reduce
the efficiency of the committees,
saying, “...the more people you have
around, the less work yougetdone.”

Grey and Anne Walter, Vice-Pres-
ident Of SGA, Voiced disagreement
with the previous Vote. Grey stated
that nonemember participation has
little impact on “most of the com-
mittees most of the time,"

Professor of Biology, Guillermo
Mendoza expressed his disgust with
the overcrowded situation at the fac»
ulty meeting by saying, “I find it
maniiestly untair that a faculty
member Should walkout because
there are too many students here.”
He suggested that such greatly at-

Campus Reaction Grows Slowly

by John Wylie

Campus reaction to the killing of
two Southern University students has
grown slowly, spurred mainly by
members of the Peace Collective,
Concerned Black Students, and Stu-
dent Government Association,

Both the Peace Collective and CBS
have gathered funds to be sent to
the families of the dead students
and t0 the Students United group
at the University, while SGA wrote
a letter to the Southern University
community depluring the “sense
less, racist murder,"

Rob Rainer and Jack Gay 0f the
Peace collective were instrumental
in placing two small, black, wooden
crosses between the United States

The texl of lhe SGA letter to
the students at Southern Uni-
versity is reprinted on page 2.

and United Nations flags on Cenr
tral Campus, and in lowering those
tlags to halt stait. president Leg-
gett was out of town at the time
they took the action, Rainer told the
son Tuesday, but he received per-
mission from the Dean's office to
lower the flags

Members of the Peace Collective
also posted notices around the Com-
pus, calling the killing of the two
students “another despicable exams

pie at what has come to be a sys-
tematic, violent repression of de-
mands ior justice, especially de-
mands ot Black people" and noting
that “the issues at stake at Southern
University are in basic harmony with
the issues at Grinnell.” >
Pledging “material Support” to the
struggle at Southern University, the
Peace Collective began seeking do-
nations fi‘om students in lunch lines
last week. The funds, which are to

United group at the University, to
taled $50 by Wednesday evening.

Concerned Black Students held
memorial services for the slziin 5th
dents on the Wednesday evening fol~
lowing the killing, and received perm
mission from the Joint Board last
week to donate half of its share of
the SAGA last money to the fam—
\lies of the dead students,

CBS and the Peace Collective had
originally been designated to share
the proceeds from the fast, which
totaled $286.60 until several stu—
dents requested that their share of
the money be refunded. The final
amount which the two families will
receive will total approxrmntely $65
according to Assistant Student Coors
dinator John Turnbull. However, be
cause of the tline»consulning SAGA
bookkeeping process, the group will
not actually be able to forward the
funds for another three weeks,

Concerned Black Students also is-
sued a statement about the killings,
declaring that, “We will not accept
its fuel lite myth that these deaths
were more Situational accidents as
opposed to the implimentation (SIC)
of America’s cowboy brand of juse
tice . " and concluding, “we‘pledge
our moral and substantial support
to our Black brothers in Southern
Louisiana in their efforts to achieve
justice "

for more than ten years,

During his visit he conducted a
seminar session in the South Lounge
concerning jazz and his recent music
as well as gave two concerts on
Saturday evening.

The degree was originally to be
presented to Hancock during the
Commencement exercises of 1970,
Campus antiwar activity, however,
forced the school to close down a
week early that Spring and the Come
mencement exercises were never
held. As a result President Leggett
informed Hancock that lhe college
would grant him the degree “the next
time he Visited campus.” Last
week’s appearance was Hancock’s
first at Grinnell Since the Second
semester of 1970

Hancock rose in national prome
inence iollowing his appearances

with the combo of Miles Davis
beginning in 1963, He remained with
Davis until 1968 when he formed his
own combo, He has recorded more
than ten LP records and has com-
posed numerous works including the
score for the movie Blow Up
Praised by critics tor his solo
and ensemble playing, Hancock an-
nually places high in reader polls
conducted by Dawn Beat maga—
zine, He was voted the number one
pianist in Down Beat’s 1969, 1970,
and 1971 polls. A New York City
resident, Hancock is president of
the Harlem Music Center, lnc.,
which was organized in 1969 to pro»
vide music workshops, perform»
ances, archives, and other facilities

Pub Issue Nears Resolution

The Committee on Student Services will soon present to Presir
dent Leggett a letter to members at the Board oi Trustees con-
cerning the establishment of a pub on campus. The letter, which
will answer questions about the pub posed by the Trustees at their
semirannual meeting early last month, should provide enough further
information that the Council will be able to make a definite de—
Cision concerning the establishment of a pub.

The Committee’s efforts were made necessary when the Trustees
passed on November 5 a resolution approving the concept of
pub on campus but asking for “a fuller statement of need an
legal, nnancial, and operational factors" of the proposal.

The Committee’s letter, SGA ViceePresident John Pfeffer told
the SdB Tuesday, should clarity to the Trustees the organizational
plan tor the pub's operation, provide a iurther rationale for the
proposed location (Gardner Lounge), and explicate more thoroughly
the tindings of the student opinion poll and the marketing survey
conducted earlier in the semester regarding the matter.

The Committee also reduced the amount of money it requests
for the pubs establishment to $7,000, less than half of the original

figure.

Should the letter prove satisfactory in ciariiying the students'
position on the matter, President Leggett anticipates that a meet-
ing of the Trustees Executive Council could he called wlthina
week. The Council has the powertoapprovethe pub's establishment.
Should that approval be given. the earliest possible date for the

opening of a pull would be at the beginning of the next semester.

Adelborg Victor ll Chess Tol ale-t

Mathematics Professor Arnold
Adelberg won the fifteenth annual
Thanksgiving Open Chess Tourna-
ment sponsored by the Cedar Valley
Chess Club last week in Waterloo,
Iowa.

He Captured first place with record
of five wins and one draw under the
Club rules, which allow the players
thirty minutes to make thirty moves.
This is a considerable faster pace
than standard tournament rules,
which usually require each player

to make 40 moves in two hours, so
this was not really considereda
“serious" tournament,

Adelberg has won this tournament
once before, and tied for first place
once, and hasalso played in other
major tournaments in the state. The
tournament drew 34 participants
from around the state, and although
it was open to anyone most of those
participating had had previous ex-
perience in tournament play.
