 

Explain Organic Farming

by Susie Muir

It is difficult for dedicated organic
farmers (AND those who eat only
organic foods) not to sound inspiras
tional; but the. fact is, the world we
live in is toxic Tobe more specif-
ic, there are now more manmade
poisons in everything that grows—
plant, animal and fish; there is poia
son in our air and in our water.
The human animal itself new car-
ries a sufficient concentration oi
DDT so that, in certain areas, its
milk is actively dangerous to its
young (R Rodale from the Basic
Book oi Organic Gardening.)

Clarence and Tillie Van Sant are
two dedicated organic farmers who
operate a health Iood store here.
It sprang from their ideals of
spreading the warning regarding
dead and poisoned foods to every-
one they could, The store started
out as a very small enterprise in the
basement of the Van Sant's farmr
house. in less than 8 years it quick-
ly outgrew the smallbasement store
and has now moved into Grinnell at
the corner of Summer and 5th
Avenue (formerly the East End
Grocery)

When asked how and why he became
an organic farmer and then branch—
ed out into selling health foods Clare
ence says, “Some nine years back
we had our well water tested for
nitrates. Forty ppm is considered to
be unsafe for human consumption.
You can imagine how we reacted
when the results of the test showed
200 ppm nitrates in the water we
had been drinking for 15 years,”
A drastic change was needed in the
Van Sant’s whole living situation.

After talking with other organic
farmers and persons deeply con—
cerned about the quality of life on
this planet Clarence and Tillie de—
cided they would start farming the
way nature intended her earth to
be used, One of the most important
assets soil needs is earthworms,
An acre of healthy soil with earth
worms can produce 700 lbs of caste
ings in a 24 hour period. These
castings are it times as high in
phosphates; 571/2 times as rich in
potash; 371/2 times as rich in
magnesium and 7 times as rich in His
trogen as the soil that surrounds
them. Since sod is where all our
plant load is grown (and ultimately
most all of our animal products)
it is important that the soil be as
healthy as possible.

Clarence rotates his crops yearly,
each succeeding crop helping the one
to come After a year at cats or
wheat Clarence will plant hay. After
two or three cuttings there will be
an almost natural mulch in the fields
and the hay helps the weeds lrom
going to seed. The next year when
beans are planted there will be little
trouble from weeds and at the same
time the beans produce nodules of
nitrogen which will lie beneiicnl to
the corn that is planted alter the
beans. Nature works in a cycle,
never is she a monoculture, says
Clarence
Clarence uses a chisel plcw to
spread his manure pile on the fields
This way matelials are chiseled iii
in the top inches of the soil where
the bacteria can get to it and start
decomposing the material. Most
formers use it moltlboard plow which
plows materials more than 7-8”

also helps to keep the soil irom
eroding When it rains the drops will
hit surtace matter and puddle instead
of running over the soil as is the
case with the moldhoard plow. Says
Clarence, “We can do a little more
sinnlng in lawn because our soil
is so rich. But we don't have the
right to do this We have to think
about the generation to come after
us. The soil must he kept alive and
well ior them ”

Just farming organically was not
enough for the Van Sants They also
wanted to help other people to be
able to enyoy good foods and there-
fore healthy living, hence the idea
of a store arose. One of Clarences’
famous quotes is that organic Ioods
satist a hidden hunger, And this is
true. Most of the foods that are
on market shelves are in themselves
dead foods. They are preserved for
shelf life and the content ofvitamlns,
minerals and taste is not given a
chance, We all have heard the adage
we are what we eat. Why is it so
hard to get people to take an interest
in what they put into there bodies?
Says Mark Graeser who works (or
Tillie in the Store “There is a lack
or understanding (respect) for one’s
body on the part of many people.
The body has a tremendous ability
to get by on what it is led, This by
no means means that this is ahealthy
body. But you can’t iorce people to
eat good foods. First or all a perr
son has to want to be a healthy
person and must want what his body
needs Vitamins and mineral tablets
are supposed to supplement une’s
diet when there is no way tor one
to receive all the necessities Irom
dne’s foods "

Everyone has heard all abolit the
evils or white sugar, flour and the
other processed foods There is no
reason to pound it in again A big
complaint against health loads is the
price. Sure the (odds cost a little
more (or in some cases a lot)
than foods you’ll find on a market
shelf Organic farmers are not by
any means plentiful, organic foods
are in demand by an ever increas-
ing number or people since no pre-
servatives are ever added spoilage
occurs faster and care must be taken
to prevent this. When one is going
against the grain of spelety (as a lot
or the readers may have already
discovered) there are many diffi-
culties that arise, Organic foods can
not be treated iii the same manner
as processed stuffs; machinery for
handling can not be the some {or
organic foods as it is Ior processed
foods,

A lot of the foods may be strange
tasting. Even the most dedicated
health food eaters won’t touch im-
properly prepared goup There have
linally appeared a number of ex-
cellent cookbooks advising onehow
to work with whole grains and other
foods. Tillie carries several titles,

Recalls Life In Stalin's Russia

by Carolyn Ashhaugh

Mrs Elena Scriabina, author of
Siege and Survival: Tile Odyssey
of a Leningrader and currently Unie
versity of iowa Russian Professor,
spent the day in Grinnell Friday
talking with students about her ex,
periences as a Russian livmg under
the Stalin regime, as a parti-
cipant in the evacuation ofLeniiigrad
during the devastating war with
Germany, as a worker ill Ger-
many in n iorced labor camp, nndas
an Immigrant to America who knew
no English Despite untold sullerr
ings at the hands of late (as she
calmly refers to it)~or history--
Mrs Scriabina has lost neither her
warmth of feeling nor her sense oi
humor,

Mrs, Scriabin's personal charm ale
ways brought her Grinnell Iriends
into the sphere of her experience
She spoke of Molotov “I bought a
big picture of Molotov And made a
frame, such a frame ” With her
hands, Mrs Scriabina measured out
the dimensions. ”And I put it on
the wall And all around it, pic-
tures of my family. And Molotov
in the center. We had a phone,
right below the picture of Molotov
Not many apartments had phones,
And when our landlady came in to
use the phone, she just looked at the
picture of Molotov. She didn't say
anything, and we were never
denounced. She must have thought,
‘They must be close tamily to Molo—
tov,’ " As Mrs, Scriabina explained
it, “Sometimes you have to use
tricks.” Though her anecdotal man-
ner of telling the story was very
pleasing, it only thinly veiled the
grim realities behind it: a Society
in which everyone was airaid to talk,
even to close friends, a society in
which one never knew who was an
informer,

Seven To Retire

At the end of this year, seven
college staff members, some with
very long terms of service, will be
retired in keeping with the college‘s
policy of manditory retirement at
65. They are: Mildred Mullins,
Ll maid With nearly 20 years of serc
vice, Ed Green, a boiler operator
with 14 1/2, Ollie McDowell, a cu-
todian with ll I/Z, Mildred Lax-
son, a Clerk with 8 1/2, Roberta
Carter, a telephone operator with a,
Viola Schooley, a counter attendant
in the Grill with 7 1/2, and Pauline
Dennis, forum attendant, with 21/2,

The College revised its retirement
policy last year, requiring all non-
academic personnel to retire at
65. Before this, staff members
were allowed to occasionally re-
main until age 70. The retirement
age (or teaching facility remained
at (so, although administrative start
was affected by the change.

in the late 1830's, she met Kosygin
during a theatre intermiSSiDn. (“You
all know Kosygin"”) ”I didirt pay
much attention to him; he wasn’t
very handsome and he wasn't very
interesting,” Later her husband had
asked her it she knew whom she
had met She was unconcerned with
kosygin, but her husband assured
her that Kosygin would rise far
when Stalin traveled by automobile,
the police cleared the streets, And
[our identical black cars went by;
no one was supposed to know in
which car Stalin was riding The
Russian department's guest watched
all this through a shop window where
she had run when the police gave
the order to clear the streets. Be-
fore the war, Stalin did not speak
to the Russian peope; only a
month or two into the war did he
begin to make radio speeches nimr
sell. Thus it was Molotov who anr
nounced to the Russian people the
German invasion, something the
Russians thought would never
happen. ”Never war with Germany.”
But hitler did not abide by the
HitlerAStalln pact.

when asked at her lecture Friday

night it party officials had lived well
during the war and if she felt any
resentment for that, Mrs. Scriablna
spoke of Stalin's daughter's book,
“She didn’t see any war. She does
n't even mention the suIIerlngs,of
the Russian people in her book, For
her there was no war All she saw
was parties. I think Stalin had a
pretty good life at Samarkind.”
And how did the Leningraders know
something drastic had happened?
“All the big party officials left.
They just packed up and lelt. We
knew something had happened, but
we didn’t know what,"

At Grinnell, Mrs. Scriabina spent
the day talking with Russian lang-
uage and Russian studies students
and presented a public lecture Fri—
day evening followed by a recep—
tion, In the lZ-credit course, Modern
Russian Society: 1900 to the Present,
she remarked highly of the students’
knowledge oi Russian society. ("As
all your students do,” she com»
menied to Mr, Whelan. ) Grinnell
seems to have pleased her, and she

Fuller To Speak Here

”I made a bargain with myselfthat
I'd discover the principles operar
tive in the universe and turn them
over to my fellow men,"

So R. Buckminster Fuller, DiSr
tinguished University Professor at
Southern IllinOis University and 1972
Commencement Speaker at Grinnell,
describes one at the goals of his
unbelievably rich, diversified life.
Celebrated [or developing principles
of synergetics, tensegrity, ephem—
eralization and tetrahedronality,
Fuller is perhaps best known [or his
geodesic dome, considered the
strongest, lightest and most effi-
cient shelter yet designed by man

Considered a dynamic and innova-
tive commentator on the physical
aesthetic, and communications

’istructures of man’s world, Fulleri

has won virtually every ma]or na-
tional and international award in en-
gineering, architecture, and various
related fields

Included are the Gold Medal and
Architectural Design Awards of the
American Institute of Architects,
Gold Medal oi the Royal Institute
in British Architects, the Award of
Excellence oi the industrial De-
signers Society of America,
Plomadc de Oro Award of the Soci-
ety oi Mexican Architects, and the
Gran Premio Award of the Trienr
nale de Milan,

Besides these speclilcaliy archir
tecturai achievements, Fuller has
been awarded as Humanist oi
the Year by the American Assocr
atlon oI Humanists, :1 Citation oI
Merit by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, a
Gold Medal by the National Institute

of Arts and Letters, and in 1969
was nominated for the Nobel Peace
Prize, He has been a Research
Professor at Southern Illinois since
1959 and in 1968 was honored with
the title oi University Professor,
making him the second {acutly morn»
her so honored in the University‘s
history.

Fuller's domes have been con—
structed in over 50 countries for a
wide variety of uses. These include
the U.S. pavilions built in Moscow
in 1959 and in Montreal for Expo
’67 , the St. Louis "Climatron",
the Palais des Sports in Paris, an
airplane museum in Amsterdam and
a US. research station at the South
Pole. Grinnell’s local example, con—
structed by Mr. Trotter's “Geodesic
Dome“ course, may be tbund in the
yard of the day-care center, across
the street Irom A,R.H.

Fuller holds a wonderfully optimis—
tic view or the prospects for man’s
iuture, viewing technology as the
key, giving him the capacity to do
more with less. Man, he notes,
will be able to solve all the physi-
cal problems oi his existence be-
cause the real wealth DI the world
is inidrmation and energy, both in-
creasing without fo'reseeabte limit,
not the earth’s dwindling resources.

Fuller travels more than 200,000
miles a year With this message,
and has expressed it in a variety
of literary works, including ”No
More Second Hand God”. “Education
Automation", Utopia or Oblivion:
The Prospects tor Humanity and
“Unfinished Epic of Industrialie
zation”,
