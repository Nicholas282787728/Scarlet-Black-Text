up numerous speeches got under
way.

Cecil liensliaiv, a Quaker, was in-
troduced as a person who had been
speaking out against the war since
its beginning, but who until recently
had been generally denied the right
to speak before gatherings. in his
address he lashed out at the idea
of having one man decide the dis
rection of a country, making deci»
sions in the name of the citizenry,

“The President does not have any
claim upon our American heritage;
it is we who claim our heritage . .
We yield to no one, least of all
President Nixon, in claiming our
heritage,” said Henshaw

He had bitter criticism against
what he termed a double standard
of policy on law and order, calling
on the government to putsuc ”law
iand order of the right kind," Hen-
shaw said the U.S. government vioe
lated numerous Geneva agreements,
particularly the specification oi the
1954 partition as a two»year pro-
visional line, not a permanent bounr
dary. ‘II we want law and Order,
let it begin at home.” he told the
gathering.

The Iiexl two speakers, Iowa See
nator John poscotl and Rep. Art
Small oi lowa City, delivered pleas
to the assembled people to take le-
gitimate political action against el—
ected‘offlclals who do not take astaild
against the war, Tapscoti criticized
the Call to patriotism by Nixon and
his supporters. “When has it been
patriotism to continue the present
atrocities , . .7” Small said the
“string of hopeful words has riln
out" for the Nixon administration.
Both called for Governor nay to
ground National Guard aircraft until
the War ends.

A spokesman for the AFL-CIO
A spokesman for the AFLrCIO,
Jim Wingert, gave assurance that

' many labor-nail trade union members
were opposed to Nixon's policy as
‘much as aiiyune, and sought to dis»
pel the notion that all labor people
supported President Nixon. He also
iihitiother administration stands, esr
ipecially wage-price controls.

“They (government officials) have
talked about labor unions causing ins
flation, but they've never talked
about the war and inflation," said
Wingert. lle appealed to anti-war
people not to split up the vote on
other issues, and to keep the car

‘ alition together. “I hope trade uni
ions try to make friends with youth,
so 'come November we can retire
Nixon,"

Senator Hughes' telephone speech
was nearly canceled due to techni-
cal problems and ti Senate roll-
cail vote.

But finally an administrative aide
was obtained to moniter Hughes’
message and repeat it over the
'phone. He said Hughes would an-
_nounce rriday the setup of ”Peace
Alert USA”, Ii lie-state mobili-
zation of public opinion to end the
war by congressional . ~ ion, 0b-
jectives of the organization, accords

i

The écariét "and Black

ing to Hughes, will be to focus at—
lention on each item of antirwar
legislation that comes before Cone
gress, and further, to move Con-
gress to action through concentrated
public opinion,

Hughes stressed the importance of
peaceful action against the war,
since “any other kind of action will
turn the tide against us,"

After a rally-ending song, the dev
monstrators poured out into Second
Street at about . 0 for the march
to the Capitol building. Some of the
demonstrators were on wheels » two
men in wheelchairs were being
pushed up the long hill to the capitol,
and a number of mothers were push-
ing their babies and toddlers in
strollers.

shopkeepers and Customers along
busy Locust Street stood outside
their stores and eyed the passing
marchers. A few showed open
hostility, some evidenced support,
but the majority appeared merely
curious.

Several men standing outside the
headquarters Of the Municipal Work—
ers Union Hall flashed peace signs
at the passing marchers, and se~
vei‘al women peering out of the upper
floors of a bank building also enr
couraged the marchers.

At its height, the column of march»
ers filled eight City blocks. Some
marchers complained about what
they assumed to be plainclothes
officers perched on rooftops along
the parade route, but Police said
the men were apparently news photo—
graphers searching for a favor
able vantage point,

Ony one incident marred the othe r
wise flawless parade. A truck drir
vei', parked in an alley between
Ttilrd and Fourth street hurled a
powerful firecracker into the line
of march. Fortunately, it exploded
in a gap between the ranks of the
marchers. Although some were
slightly shaken by the loud report,
no one was injured,

As the marchers moved closer to
the capitol building, their loud chants
began to echo through the Canyons of
the business district.

The marchers gathered at the base
of capitol hill, on the'step's and‘on
the surrounding grass, projecting a
relaxed atmosphere. Speakers from
the crowd gave spontaneous addres-
ses, and some Anglo»Saxonist chants
were Started up. The demonstrae
tors sang a number ofsongs, capped
by a rousing rendition of “The Feel
Like rm Fixing to Dle Rug,”

But the calm ended as some pror
testors decided they wanted Gove»
rnor Robert Ray to address them.
The whole crowd picked up the chant
“We want Ray," and began to move
up the steps toward the cordon of
state. county and highway police on
the capitol steps. Other Des Moines
police standing on the hill joined
the existing detachment of officers.

The demonstrators' advance ended
about twenty feet from the entrance
to the capitol, where most of them
sat own to hear a barrage of
criti ism against Governor Ray, and
in favor of a governor ‘twho will

push the President to peace,"

The rally was plagued by a lack of
definite programming, Originally
scheduled was a mock impeachment
trial by Iowa City students, but
the students never showed up, As
a result the crowd became idle and
restless, and began to hurl sentiment
at police. Several demonstrators
spoke out in heated tones, especir
ally against Ray and the front of the
gathering began to move toward the
steps,

But each time the Situation was
brought under control by marshulls,
many of them Gi iiinell students, who
sat on the steps, and then proceed
ed to move protestors back to A
safer distance.

Mobilization of the marshalls along
with speeches by organizers to set
an example of peace, helped cool
down fiery elements ofthe gathering.
After the second unfriendly move
toward police, however, organizers
felt it necessary to call out Senator
Tapscott, in order to fix a purpose
to the gathering. Tapscott urged that
the demonstrators remain peaceful.
“If the governor does not show
up, then disband and go back to
your community to defeat him in
November.” he told them. Tapscott
took the occasion to hit Ray for re
fusing to speak up against the war.

Tapscott's address turned the as-
sembly into a political rally, touch»
ing on praise for anti—war candi-
dates, McGovern, Hughes, aiid Tap-
scott in particular, by speakers from
the crowd, One speaker urged voters
“not to Stab our friends in the back”
after they “risked their political
chances” by identifying with the
anti—war movement,

The end of these political speeches
signaled the end of the day’s actiVle
ties,
began to disperse.

Afterwards it was learned that Ray
was not in town during the afternoon
rally at the capitol An adininl’se
trative assistant to Ray, William H.
Jackson, told the 3&3 the governor
was in Fort Des Moines Hotel at
noon to address a convention, but
left immediately after the speech to
attend to business in Jefferson and
Boone. This information never got
to the crowd. Ray could not be
reached for comment on the day’s
anti-war activities.

.Slieehan Warns Of Centralized State

Neil Sheellan, whose reporting of
the Pentagon Papers last year won
the Pulitzer Prize for his paper
,The New York Times, spoke to
about 350 people zit llerlick Wed-
nesday night on "The Pentagon
papers and the Centralized state."

’ Sheellan said the papers indicate a
drift toward authoritarianism in US
government, particularly in the
executive branch and inside the
national security apparatus. He said
the government was now taking on
an existence of its own “outside
the body politic" and warned that
unless a way can be found to re-
store the checksrnlitlrbalnnces of
the Constitution. the US might be-
come an authoi‘llai'ii’ln, centralized
State "on the European model"

Sheehnn Said the Pentagon Papers
were valuable for the insight they
offered into the way decisions were
made within the llureacrdcy, “To
read the Pentagon Papers is to step
through ‘ looking gid 's Illtll :Itlfiltlct'
worltf, --a world where great value
is placed on secrecy and loyalty
to the organization for their own
sake Tllt‘m’t villut-s (lo not necess-

arily have any application to true
national security needs, Sheehan
said.

The Pentagon Papers show that the
Vietnam war was, and is, an "exeCr
utive war,“ waged by a few men (it
the top without legislative sanction
whom Sheehan termed mandamus,
The Vietnam war was fought to pror
tect part of an American empire
acquired during the cold war when
the country really felt its security
threatened, The problem, as Sheer
nan saw it, was that, once having
acquired during the Cold War when
the top felt obliged to defend it
despite the fact that it had no
rational connection with national
safety.

Sheehan said the Vietnam war was
symptomatic of larger trends that
begun with the cold war. He said
the us began to act as an im-
pcrial power in foreign affairs and
that this had recently begun to
carry over |nto tlonieslir uttuii us

government defenses of attempts to
prevent publication of the Pentagon
Papers and to institute wiretapping
in rltst‘s where national Svrtii‘ltv was

alleged to be involved
"Foreign and domestic affairs are
entertwmcd," Sheehan said. “it is
a mistake to think otherwise," He
said that the first signs ofun author»
itarian state were already present
in the government’s attitude that it
was above the law in some way,
that the law did not apply to it.
stieehan saw a solution in the rose
torntion or constitutional checks and
balances to curtail the autonomy of
the executive branch, This would
require Congress to assume a new
rcsponsibility to erect what he called
"administrative roadblocks" in the
path of the executive branch, Shee-
han suggested that the president
might be forbidden to call up rer

without Congressional approval as
an exuiilple of the type of road
block he meant.

Sheeluin ended by pointing out that

social institutions such as the courts

For Protest

At Chamberlain Plant

After two days or fairly detailed
planning, a proposed demonstration
against the Chamberlain Munitions
plant in Waterloo was suddenly
scrapped during a meeting Tuesday
night in Cedar Falls.

The original demonstration, to be
coordinated among colleges across
the state, had been planned for
Thursday, Participants had expected
to split into two groups. One would
engage strictly in peaceful pickets
ing actvities without making any
efforts to disrupt the plant's opera
tions.

The other had planned to engage
in various forms of civil disubetl»
iehce, perhaps even to the stage
of blocking entrances and exits of
the munitions factory to truck ti‘ufr
fic. This group was also consider
ing guerilla theatre .is a tactic

Tuesday liight, however, leaders
of the student protesters were met
in Cedar Falls with tlistl‘ulling news.
Labor and community organizers,
all long-time supporters of the
anti-war movement, expressed
grave fears about what effect such
a demonstrdlion would liuve on the
community rapport they had built
tip.

Even more important, however,
were their views 01 the probable
reaction of the Waterloo utilimlitles.
The general consensus of the Cc .
Falls people was the Waterloo Police
were, ill the words of the Gillinell
representative, "Just waiting toi an
excuse lo crack some treads opcli,"

Fears of widespread violence rc-
sultilig from the demonstration led
the group to abandon all plans lot

action in Waterloo. As a statewide
group oi leaders was already
assembled, they began searching for
alternate targets for a demon—
stration,

Leaders finally settled on the Fed
eral Building and state Capitol in
Des Moines, and began the planning
which culminated in Thursday‘s
demonstration andMarch.

Crime Rises
As Year Ends

Chief Bill Peters reported several

types of criminal actvity to the
SSLB Wednesday. Stolen bicycles
top the list of thefts, and Peters
again Warned students to protect
their hikes,

Eight expensive imported multls
speed bicycles were reported stolen
from the Grinnell campus during a
brief period last week. Peters is
reasonably certain that the same
individual or group was responsible
for all eight thefts,

Another stolen bicycle was re
covered from a William Penn Cole
lege student. However, Peters said
that insufficient evidence was avail-
able to his department [or charges
lo be filed.

Peters also reported tllat an
unknown person fired a pellet gun
