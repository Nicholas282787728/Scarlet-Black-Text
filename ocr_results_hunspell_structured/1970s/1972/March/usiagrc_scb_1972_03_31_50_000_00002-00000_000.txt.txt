The Scarlet and Black

Russian Course Views Vary

by Ann Cassel

Some time during the last school
year Mr. Gregory Gurofi (History),
Mr. Dennis Whelan (Russian), and
Mr. William Daly (Political Science)
began discussing the idea of a
twelve»credit course on modern
Russian society, which would study
all phases of Russian society inten—
sively. Three faculty members from
three different disciplines would be
involved in its teaching, giving slur
dents a broader perspective than
would be possible from one instruce
tor.

The philosophy behind such a
course involves, as is stated in the
nine-page course proposal, “a num»
her of ‘hunches’ about the nature of
the learning process," These “hun-
ches” include the idea that students
can learn better if they can develop
an empathy for the people they are
studying, the proposition that stu-
dents Wili benefit from a variety
or interpretations ot a subject, and
that “the methodological problems
of the social sciences and the hu-
manities are interrelated and can
best be understood as they apply to
a concrete body of knowledge.” Mr,
Gurol'l' stated the main impetus be-
hind having such a course as ens
abling the student to “understand
the culture from the inside out.”

The modern Russian civilization
class that had once been an idea
became a reality this semester:
it meets for two hours in the after-
noon on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday and is taught by Gregory
Guroﬂ, Dennis Whelan and Robert
Grey. The first two weeks of the
course involved a series of lecA
tures on Russian society until 1900,
after which the students divided into
groups, each studying a diiterent
aspect of Russian culture from 1900
to 1917. Alter intensive studying in

their assigned areas the groups pre-
sented their findings lo the class
These presentations were termed by

Whelan as “50% successful" be»
cause they lacked direction. stu—
dents and faculty involved in the
course are currently working out
ways to make such presentations
more successful, A type of game
play was used for the study or the
revolutionary period Ditlerent
groups played the parts of difierent
political factions at the time and pre-
sented the viewpoints of these fac—
tions.

According to two teachers of the
course and several students, the
discussions have been most sub
cessful among both the students and
the faculty. Gurotl feels “the par
ticipation of the kids is great,” and
Whelan states that all but a few of
the students participated in every
discussion, and those who do not
are willing to participate it asked
In reference to discussion among
the faculty which at times can turn
into argument, Mary Jane Elam, a
freshman in the class, says “When
they argue they’ll bring out some:
thing that Ididn't understand ”

The amount of work given the stur
dents seemed to be a sore point in
the one class I attended, There is a
basic required reading list tor ev-
eryone in the Class which consists
of 30 books, and additional reading
is assigned in individual areas.
Outside of class, however, students
do not feel that the work load is too
heavy. Mary Jane says “I don't
know whether to say there's too
much work hecauseivl went into it
knowing there would be a lot of
work,” She also observes that the
amount or background one has in the
area makes a lot of difference, and
that because she has little such back
ground the course is more ditticult

for her Susan Morrice, a sophomore
member of the class, notes that “Ev»
eryone who Went into it knew There
was going to he a lot of work,”

The idea of having three faculty
members in every class session is
also appreciated by both faculty and
students, Nearly all students men~
tioned the variety of approaches and
opinions expressed in the class is
a decided advantage. Whelan ob»
serves that the faculty involved can
criticize each other’s perfor-
mances, something that he feels
should be done more often.

A few faults with the class, how-

ever, are mentioned by faculty and ‘

students. One general complaint
concerns the size of the class:
there are thirty people in it now;
only twelve to fifteen were expected.
Most students complain that more
Could be accomplished in a class of
a smaller size. Whelan feels that The
class has not done enough of looking
at Russia from within, which was
originally one of the main purposes
of the class One student who
chooses to remain anonymous
agrees, stating that she is a little
disappointed about the little she has
learned about the life of the indivi—
dual person in Russia,

Guroff thinks the main problems
are organization and that the stur
dents as well as the teachers are
planning the best way ofpresenta—
tion. The need for more money is
emphasized by Whelan, who feels
that this money could be put to good
use on such things as movies deale
Trig with the period and movies made
in Russia during the period the class
is studying

In general, the reactions to the
class have been very favorable,
Whelan terms it “about the most
exciting thing I’ve been engaged
with.” One student even goes so far
as to Say that She would like to see
it done in other areas. As with all
other classes, though, most people
see the problems and no one is to
tally satisfied. When this reporter
asked if the course has become
what he hoped it would be, Gurol‘f
replied, “Nothing ever is.”

Tuslt Forces Still Active

by Craig Murphy

Two weeks of Spring break has
hindered the continuity of the Stur
dent Power movement formed at

,crinnell in early March. Rob Ramer,

Kay Sophar, and Jenna Finch, the
chairman of three task forces con-

‘ nected with the movement, plan to

consider the ramifications of the
break this Week.‘

The three task forces, formed at
a meeting ot twoehundred students
to discuss the case OI Mr, Nasser’s
terminal contract, are aimed at the
broader issues which the case iIIHSr
trates: the question or a student
voice on the Executive Council, and
the question of student power on the
Educational policy Committees.

In an attempt to educate students
about these issues Jenna Finch is
going to suggest that meetings be
called on the hall level where four
or five faculty members can answer
the questions of students about the
system. in her view the smaller
number of students will assure that
protessors will not be puton the
detensive, “as Professor Worley
was at the earlier, (February 23),
meeting.” She also believes that the
case of education professor Gordon
Mather should be brought up. His
antlrbehaviorist attitudes differ with
those of his colleagues as much as
Nasser’s Marxian views are in up-
position to those oi the other mem-

.hers ot the philosophy department,

On the direct question of how stu-
dents should obtain more power
there seems to be little agreement,

Atlempls will be made to formulate
a program to present to an all cam»
pus meeting as soon as possible.
All task forces have met with interr
ested taculty, however, these con-
tacts have been few since break.
Executive Council task force chairr
man Kay Sophar was surprised to
learn that one professor she had
contacted, Mr. Gurolf, had made a
proposal to the Executive Council
to deal with the Student Power
question

Although it has lost steam, the
movement to force the rehiring of
Alan Nasser is not at a halt. indi-
cations, irom a student poll, are
that the vast majority or philosophy
majors and other students want
Nasser rehired,

To Discuss
Grading Plan

Faculty consideration of the Parse
low Grading proposal will begin
Monday. The A-B-Cr Erase portion
of the proposal has received Exec»
utive Council approval, but that body
recommended rejection of the pure
CrediteErase portion of the plan.
Faculty Chairman Beryl Clottelter
explained that the Council felt a
Credit-Erase plan was a waste of
time and effort when an Asset:

.Erase system would already exist,
However. Donna Rothenherg plans
to appear at the meeting to present
the point of view of those who teel
a Ci‘edltrErase option should be a
part or the minus“ grading system.
