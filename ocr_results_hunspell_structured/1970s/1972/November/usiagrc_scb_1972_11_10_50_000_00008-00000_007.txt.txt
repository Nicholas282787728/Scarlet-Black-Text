Prepping

Now is approaching the time or year when
prepping or hazing, the most ancient oi
collegiate Customs, comes in for a con-
certed attack by both students and iaculty.
Freshmen, with the largest part or their
probation period over, but with the mem-
ory oi the sting oi the paddle still too fresh
in their minds, are inclined to ﬂavor some
authoritative ruling, either by students or
faculty, to make life easier tor the in»
ture generation or preps
Faculty members, having heard exagger»
ated reports or violent prepping during the
year, and they themselves, perhaps alumni
oi a school where corrective measures by
upperciassmen were unknown or prohibited,
also wish ior a change toward moderation.
Discussed by Men

The topic is discussed in classes cone
lined to ireshman men, in iaculty circles,
and in talk tests at the dorms. What can
be and has been done by such agitation is
well known to upperciassmen. For the most
part, the preps themselves are not tar—
sighted enough to anticipate their attitude
when they become sophomores withauthorr
ity to wield a paddle

Two years ago, led lile few faculty meni-
bers, the men at the lreshman class sign—
ed a pledge promising to reiuse to assist
in a paddle parade during the remainder
or their college career, and the next fall,
the movement gaining impetus by the con
version or a iew inﬂuential uppei-cinssnien,
the paddle parade was abolished
Personally, the iresliman paddle parade,
of which we were a part, has become one
oi our best memories oi our years at
Grinnell, but there is no doubt tillit Such a
parade had its obiectionaiiie reatnres, and
much as we hated to see it go. perttdps
the college is better oti Without it.

LYNCH‘S

But should this Spirit of reform Continue
until all prepping is abolished? There are
lew even among the tacuity who will anr
wer ”yes” to that question personally we
are in {over oi prepping cta sort, but the
real question is, to what extent should
student opinion allow upperclassmen to go
in carrying out prepping?

We are iirnily convinced that prepping
can be a help to a freshman. It teaches
him that there is a great deal of life
which he does not know, and it makes him
able to appreciate that there are others who
know a great deal more than he does. We
have seen execollege Students, and those
who were obliged to quit with only a high
school education, start out to work in the
same office, and by his attitude toward
the “oldrtimers”, it was not hard to point
out the man who had undergone prepping.
lie was willing and eager to be shown,
and had a deierential respect tor Experi—
ence which made his meworkers glad to
teach him, and which was entirely lacke
ing in the other man.

Paddle A Vital Part

OI course all prepping is not contined
Io paddling, but there is no doubt that the
paddle is a mightiy vital part at it It is
too true that sometimes here in Grinneli
there is a good deal oi unnecessary pads
diing, which we believe should be curbed,
but We would not censor the whole paddle
system because oi those who let a little
authority go to their heads, That element,
we believe needs correction as much as the
cocky tresiiman,

We admit that there iS n good dedi Oi
rougii inn in paddling our ireslimen when
not necessary. [or we have done it Our—
selves. There are those who will say,
“Spare the paddle and spoil the prep,"
which may or may not be true, but What
we advocate is to spare the paddle when
using it {or amusement, but never when
used as it corrective measure.
