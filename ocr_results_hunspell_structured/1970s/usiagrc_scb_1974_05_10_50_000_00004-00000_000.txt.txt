Student Input Out?

Grinnell students are being confronted by a crucial policy ques—
tion, one which might well determine the future status of student
input, rights and power within the educational system here. The
Walker proposal to remove the last vestiges of student control
from faculty evaluations, if accepted, would efﬁctively undermine
what little is left of student participation in the faculty selection
process.

Mr. Walker maintains that the number of different faculty eval-
uations is having an adverse effect on “faculty morale.” In fact,
some professors have felt pressured into teaching, assigning and
grading in a way which they feel will improve their evaluations.
We applaud those professors who are ﬂexible and dedicated enough
to respond to constructive criticism positively.

However, Mr. Walker suggests that some of these changes
implemented to improve ratings have failed ‘to advance the eff-
ectiveness of instruction. He also voiced the fear that those
whom we now consider poor professors will in retrospectbe
appreciated. We maintain that a good professor has nothing
to fear from the learning experience an evaluation provides.
We certainly hope that ‘Mr. Walker is not laboring under the de»
lusion that an easy “A" will insure a good evaluation. Far from
it, evidence attests to the fact that those "nice guys” who are
poor teachers receive low ratings.

Mr. Walker is concerned that professors’ reputations and careers
should be based on “effectiveness of teaching, not evaluation 50«
ores." We do not see a contradiction between good teaching
and good evaluation. These terms should be equivalent.

If they are not, we have reached the root of the problem. Should
there be a discrepancy between teacher quality and rating, then
the criteria for evaluation must be improved. This wouldbe a
project that both faculty and studens could formulate together.
Furthermore, an intensive development of teacher evaluation
would probably help create the unity Mr. Walker is seeking.
An acceptable evaluation methodology could be used by all par-
ties interested in teacher evaluation. '

Thus we strongly disagree with Mr. Walker’s proposal for revi-

sing the evaluation program. We cannot accept the substitution
of an unmistakably tokenistic evaluation, even for the minimal
representation which we now possess. We respect the staff
difficulties Mr. Walker is encountering, however we believe
that he is dealing with ‘them in an inappropriate manner. Cer-
tainly the Executive Council, a small, elite group, lacks the
resources, manpower, and student viewpoint necessary to conduct
the indepth analysis which any evaluation requires.

Finally, we take issue with Mr. Walker’s assertion that stu-
dent opinion usually is honored in consideration of faculty posi-
tions. Unfortunately, too often this has not been the case. Students
must demand not only administration of faculty evaluations, using
a meaningful methodology acceptable to all parties, but also that
significant weight be attached to these findings. While we ce mainly
do not advocate total student control over the faculty selection
process, neither do we feel that the faculty should be privileged
with the entire responsibility of this ope ration. Although we regret
that some professors have felt driven to an "early retirement"
because of inadequacies in the current evaluation process; we
equally regret the loss of these good professors whose teaching
ability was supported by student opinion, but unable to be backed

. by student power.

The students in this college face a decision. Either we can pass-
ively allow the last remnants of student input into the educational
process to disappear, or we can fight for a meaningful role within
the Grinnell educational syste m. Whatever the student decision, it
will undoubtedly have a great impact on student involvement in all
aspects of educational policy in the years to come.

Adelberg: Eyes Chess
Ratings as Relative

To the Editors:

In response to Geoff Wyatt’s let—
ter on chess ratings, 1 may not
be as good a chess player as Jon
Kolber, but i am certainly at least
as Strong as he is in tiddleyw‘lnks,
and may possibly be better at Chl~
nese checkers.

Seriously, Jon Kolher is a fine
chess player, and is currently rated
higher than I am inthe ofﬁcial USCF
list, but so what? Chess ratings are
not static, but change accordingto
performance in all rated tourna-
merits. At times in the past I had
a far higher rating than he does now.
What I don’t understand is why any-
body would write Such a letter and
more signiﬁcantly, why the s and B
would publish it. If there is a cam—
pus issue here, it is not one of
which I am aware.

Wl'uld you publish a letter from
individual A asserting that indivi-
dual B is smarter ( or better,
prettier, or purer )than individual
C and citing as documentary evi—
dence their respective cumulative
grade point averages? i am afraid
that Jon has been ill-served by his
friends in this instance.
