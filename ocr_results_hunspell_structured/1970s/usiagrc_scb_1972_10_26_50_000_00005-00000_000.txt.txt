commanded us to make straight the

make the mountains low, no ask my

The mighty highway lobby hasonce
again flexed its muscles ill the halls
oi Congress and the HouseofRepre-
sentatives has traditionally bowed in
recognition. As of Monday, October
is, House and Senate conierees are

deadlocked 0n the 1972 Federal I'Iigh-
way Act which contains an amends
ment providing for the use otasmall
fraction oi the sacrosanct Highway
Trust Fund for mass transportation.
Ttie House not only rejectedthe Sell—
ate's progressive version oftlle bill,
but also took a step backwards by
allowing billboards to remain
standing in its own version.

Speciiically, the Senate’sbill would
allow metropolitian areas to utilize
their share of the Trust Fund for
mass transit projects if they so de—
sired. This would amount to $800
million of the $5 billion total The
Trust Fund, which was created in
1956, was designed to tinance the
Interstate highway system (like so
many other projects, built in the
interests oi national security) and
derives its monies primarily ircm
motor fuel taxes. A viscious circle
was thus begun because motor Iuel
taxes allowed tlte construction of
more highways, more highways are
known to beget more autos which
in turn generate more motor fuel
taxes and so on. The present birth
rate of autos has exceeded that of
Americans from some time; 200
billion gallons oi crude oil per year

are consumed [or refining into gasos
line.

Only recently have transportation
planners started to wake up to the
[act thztt the Interstate svsteln,
rightly called the greatest public
works project in the history olman»
kind, and other highways simply will
not answer our iuture transportation
requirements This is largely be.
cause automotive transportation is
incredibly inefiicient, i’i realization
at growing significance in our pres
sent energy crisis, A bus is live
times as efficient as a Car. A subs
urban train receives zoo passenger
miles per gallon oi gasoline cums
pared to an auto's 22 passenger
miles. Occupancy oi cars during
peak load averages 12 persons per
vehicle. Autos account tor over 50%
of all urban air pollution and,
despite alltipoliution devices and
possible engineering improvements
such as the Wankel engine, auto
manufacturers say they will not be
able to meet 1975 emission stan-
dards,’Finally, the auto can be in—
dicted for gobbling up vast quanti-
ties of urban space as exemplified
by Los Angeies,

The answer lies in increased public
transportation even though our
social system is biased against it.
Public transit must be subsidized
at least long enough to make it
competitive with automotive travel.
in cities all across the country,
bus, rapid transit, and commuter
rail lines are going bankrupt while
expressways and central business
districts are becoming unbearably
congested with traffic
Consequently, many leaders ins
cluding Secretary of Transportation
Volpe and President Nixon have
urged the opening up oi the High—
way Trust Fund for mass transit
projects. But the House ofRepre-
sentatives, including our Own Fred
Schwengel, voted last week against
this measure and authorized anaddi—
tional $1.5 billion in federal general
revenues for highway purposes.
Their outmoded relusal to “bust
the Trust” is as ridiculous as dic-
tating that tobacco taxes must be
used to purchase ash trays or that
alcohol taxes purchase hair stools.

Man And
Eon

And so the pouring oi concrete
continues it has, however, been
halted or stalled in cities such as
Boston, San Francisco, and in Chl-
cago where a citizen’s group called
the AntisCI‘osstown Coalition is
lighting a 22 mile concrete swath
which will cost between $50 and
$100 million per mile to build and
will have tremendous social costs.
Another group, the Highway Action
Coalition in Washington D.C, is
attemtping to beat the highway lobby
at its own game, -

Urbanites are not alone in the
struggle against concrete, The lowa
Conference oi Environmental Quilts
ity is currently trying to delay con—
struction of a 1,900 mile, 32 6 billion
expresswaystl‘eeway network. The
lowa Highway Commission’s scheme
would replace presexisting two lane
state and iederal highways withiour
lane ones. it will link up such booin-
ing metropolises as Keokuk and
Mason City. The enVironmentalist
group decries the trick oi highway

planners to submit environmental
impact statements piecemeal, 1g-

noring the mammoth effects of the
total system. Building highways
in segments is a ploy equaly useful
in overriding protests, the rationale
being that once part is built, the
project can not be stopped without
wasting the taxpayer’s money. Poe
jects like the lowa Expressways
freeway network and Chicago‘s
Crosstown Expressway are classic
cases of what economist Kenneth
Bouiding call suboptlmizdtion: the
iinding out of the best way to do
something that should not be doneat
all.

Kulawiec: Praise

To the Editors:

1 just want to write and say that
I enjoyed immensely your recent
photographlc supplemente it is one
of the best things I’ve seen around
here. Some of the photos were pure
prize-winners in my humble judg
ment, especially, the post and chain,
the side of a barn, the big man and
his pipe, and the farm scene, One
thing I missed though was some
technical data on each photo, Also,
how was the quality oi the last
photo achieved elt looks more like
a woodscul than a photo reproduc—
tion. Thanks again. Hope to see a
series of such supplements.

Ed Kulawiec

(Ed. note: Mt. Arnold has provided
us with the following technical data
on his photographs: ”The photograph
on the back cover started as a low
contrast shot of a farm scene in
Oldwick, N.J., using Panatomicsx.
The P-X negative was enlarged on
a sheet of 4x5 Kodalith Ortho film.
This renders a positive image with
no middle grey tones. This sheet
was contact printed on another sheet
of Kodaiith to make a negative. Con»
tacted on a sheet at photographic
paper, this gave the iinal print.
The post and chain photograph was
shot early in the morning using
Tri X.”

We intend to have more photo-
graphic supplements in the tuture.)

ing up work missed on that Thurs-
day, students would feel under press
sure from the work and attend class
rather than work at the polls. Mcs
Govern supporters at the meeting
also pointed out that election work
ers are critical on election day and
that there is a possibility oi
McGovern carrying Iowa it enough
help is available on that day

In other action the Joint Boards
voted to recommend that student-
faculty committee meetings be open
to anyone wishing to attend, This
countered a recommendation from
the Committee on Faculty Organiza-
tion that such meetings be closed.

Mr. Dawson, who had beeninvited to
attend to speak in favor of the fac-

ulty committee’s recommendation

failed to appear. Final vote on the
issue was IG-Usz.
