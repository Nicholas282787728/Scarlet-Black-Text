sively and oftensively, the team
played extremely well for the first
ten minutes and led, 17715. Central
then began penetrating the
Grinnell defense with effective
passing and beg-an making use oi
its greater height and mobility.
Central scores started coming
from within ten feet of the basket.
At the end of the first half, Central
led, 30722, with Nelson leading
Pioneer scorers with eight points.

even with Central, but with the

its offense. The Pioneers
here lorced to take shots from
outside of their best shooting
range, While Central dominated

solid 52728 lead.

Grinnell's leading scorer “as
Nelson \\lth 12 points. Cliasson
finished \\ilh nine, Krutilla with
eight, Reese with four. and Stidley
with s' '.

The Pioneers are laced with
several problems. Their passing
tends to become erratic and
hurried as they begin to fall behind
and they sometimes have trouble
scoring on an oiiensive rebound.
Also. they must capitalize on their
fast break and steals. Even though
the team does have effective
'outside shooters, its shooting
percentage from this range cannot
compare with that oi a team that
shoots from within ten feet of the
basket, as Central did. With imr
provements in these 'areas,
Grinnell can look to the future with
optimism,
