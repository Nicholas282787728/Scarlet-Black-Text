or ofﬂrmollvo intent?

Affirmative action on this campus appears to be ex-
periencing a slow death. The lack of female administrators
and tenured women faculty is evidence of a conscious or
unconscious disregard for equal rights.

Of forty-four full professors, two are women [both in
Spanishl; out of twenty-one associate professors four are
women tone of whom is Dean Eysenbachl. There are no
tenured women faculty in the Social Sciences division,
Science division, or Fine Arts division. Many of the women
recently hired are in one-year replacement positions (for
professors on sabbatical), or have been brought into tenure-
filled departments leg. Englishl. Many other faculty women
are faculty wives or on shared contracts with their
husbands.

Three of the five positions effected by the recent ad-
ministrative reorganization were held by women. As a result
of this reorganization there are now just five female ad-
ministrators out of a total of thirty.

Although the “White Paper" does not specifically refer to
affirmative action for women, as it does to minorities, the
administration maintains that the role of women in this
community is implicit in the discussion of sex roles (erg.
“family"l, and sexuality. There were no female members of '
the faculty appointed to lead student discussions of the
“White Paper” (or act as recorders). When asked why this
had been overlooked the response was a surprised “I didn't
even think about it" It is this innocent lack of awareness
that is destroying the “liberal spirit” ofthis institution.

The College has a commitment to affirmative action.
Indeed, the 1973 affirmative action program adopted by the
administration repeatedly speaks of the intent to continually
revise and review its policies in this regard. But something
more than lip service and rhetoric is needed. Active seeking-
out of qualified women candidates, as well as advertising in
media pertinent to women, is essentialr In the recent search
to fill the two and a half positions open in the psychology
department only one female candidate was interviewed. Such
a drastic dichotomy exists between the philosophy espoused
by the administration and the actions taken that cognizance
is clearly lacking. In the words of one female faculty member
“I think the facts speak for themselves"

merely demanding basic human rights—many of which had already been guaranteed to them under the

It is easy, when one is in Grinnell. to forget that justice has been, and still is: myth in the United
States Yet each of us has a duty as a human being to strive for true justicchnot only within the U.S. but

throughout the entire world

Our brothers who died on this day will never have a chance for justice They were exlerminated

Cuts decried:

To the Editor: The statements
made by President Turner in last
week‘s 3513 article, “Ads
ministrative shake-up occurs
during summer," provide a telling
context in which to interpret
statements made in the con-
vocation speech and the 23-page
White Paper circulating on
campus. The irony of the juxs
laposition of this article with the
text of the convocation speech on
the front page of the paper is grim
and painfully undermines Pres.
Turner’s credibility. Consider that
on page 19 of the White Paper
Turner cites the frustration and
mistrustof motives caused by poor
communication between various
college committees. On page 20 he
states: “Only if we sense that a
community of trust exists among
the various constituencies of the
college will governance serve any
educational purpose as a model of
effective human relations.”

Defending the administrative
reorganization that was effected
without consultation of either
students or faculty, Turner says in
the SK'B article that decisions
regarding services of the college
are strictly administrative. Unless

 

that service, he continues, is likely
to suffer as a result of the cuts,
Students have no concern in the
matter. Disregard for a moment
the fact that both the concerts
program and GORP will suffer
tremendously from the loss of fullr
time staff. A fact which robs
Turner’s defense of any serious
consideration and causes one to
marvel at the feat of doublethink
required to reach his defense
position!

The President’s intent appears to
be to convey the message that
Grinnell College is a provider of
certain commodities and that
among them are certain services.
Only when the quality of the
commodities suffers, do the
customers have a right to concern
themselves with policies 'and
specific actions that affect those
commodities. The extension of that
logic has strange implications in
an institution which claims as a
goal the creation of morally in-
formed, ethical citizens. If, for
example, the administration found
it more economical to purchase
non-UFW lettuce for the food

 

service, despite the student sup-
port for the lettuce boycott, is it of

no concern to the students that
their money is being used I" \
maintain the status quo of rac‘ ,
injustice and worker exploitation?
And if themanner in which the cuts
were made is not in full accord
with the spirit of Affirmati f
Action, which the colleg
nominally supports, is it not an
affront to every socially aware
person in this community? one
cannot but wonder how the view of
Grinnell as a supplier of com-
modities is to be reconciled with
the joyful community of mutual
respect in which a single voicercan
be heard.

The very idea of maintai ing “a
climate of participatory
democracy” while running
$8,000,000 business is absurd. Tl
administration recognizes this by
its actions but not in its rhetoric.
There is no room in a community at
trust for schizophrenic vacillati ‘ .
between diametrically opposg
concepts or the college merely for
the convenience of the ad-
ministrators.

It hurts me toleave Grinnell with
as deep a mistrust of institutional
motives and procedure as I had
when I arrived here in 1972. If the
administration would honestly
express the feelings that are
evidenced by its actions i could at
least respect the integrity of thc_
individuals in it. Elizabeth Archersr

importance of her abilities, and
express our disappointment in the
administration's decision. Cun-
sidering Grinnell’s locality and
isolation, Ms. Dentel may well be
our savior from cultural and social
oblivion.

It is not to be thought that the re-

reﬂect any weakness of

Turner. On the contrary, the ad-
ministration would gain our
esteem by demonstrating its

To the Editor: A copy of the
above position, signed by 309
students,has been submitted to the
Dean and the President of the
College. Another copy has aready
been sent to the Chairperson of the
Board of Trustees We feel that the
College has acted contrary to its
expressed Affirmative Action
Program in eliminating Georgia
Dentel’s, Kathy McCluskey‘s and
Tom Latimer’s positions and
subsequently creating one new
position which was awarded to Mr.
Latimer Without advertising this
position or giving due con-
sideration to other applicants.

We want to emphasize that this
petition by no means represents
the center of our concern. Rather,
the main issue we face is the
neglect of effective student input
into Grinncll’s administrative
machine. We feel, however, that
activity around a concrete issue
will yield more fruitful results than
simply demanding more power in

' the abstract, We will a achieve our

democratic rights not by asking for
them but by actively practicing
them. Furthermore, this Afr
firmative Action approach makes
it possibleto appeal our grievances
to the Trustees, who hold the actual
power of the College.

Mr. Turner has called for
“student input”—this petition is
exactly that. Indeed. the ad-
ministration’s response to this w'll
be a good indicator of how in,
value the “input" they so often call
for.

Grinnell students have an ex-
cellent history of actively
responding to issues that direc
concern them. Let's keep our past
in mind and struggle one step
further to demand our basic
democratic rights. Any “liberal-
arts" institution, which has an
expressed interest in educating its
students for life in a modern
society, must be willing to yield
these to us. The members of
