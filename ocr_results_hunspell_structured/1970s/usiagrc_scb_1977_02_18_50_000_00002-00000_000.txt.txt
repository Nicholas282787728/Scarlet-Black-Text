Housing policy

Four Housing Committee policies will apply to the allocation oi
collegeowned coop and non-co-op houses next year:

iThe committee wtli make special effort to guard against
groups that iorm projects mainly to increase chances oi getting a
house and that are not sincere about making the project work. The
committee thinks some groups this year iormcd badly planned
projects mainly to get first chance at housing.

7Pr0ject groups which are denied houses will wait until after all
nonsproject groups have been accommodated beiore they are given
any leitover houses. Previously, denied projects could draw houses
at the same time as non-prUJect groups. Committee member
Claudia Kee said the change was made to prevent project groups
irom having two chances at housing while non-project groups have
only one.

7A1] members of groups applying for coop houses must' sign a
contract prior to the awarding oi the houses. In past semesters, not
all members had signed prior to the awarding. The contract.
basically, commits the student to group housing and relinquishes
the student's right to room draw.

iProject groups reapplying ior housing will be partially judged
on how well the project worked this year,

Energy discussed

The college's committee on energy policy has met twice since
February 4, the iirst meetings it has had since it met once in Oc-
tober At the iirst meeting, held February 7, committee chairman
Dale Hawn handed out statistics dealing with energy consumption
and cost to committee members. According to committee member

sound,

At the second meeting Hawn discussed with committee members
the possibility oi spending $10,000 to purchase two meters which
would provide accurate date on energy consumption within in-
dividual buildings, He also told committee members that they
should think about recommending changes in building schedules
and the academic calendar that would conserve energy. in ad
dition. he told them to think about how to reduce use oi heat and
light and maintain a "comfort level,"

Building. Leach, seasoned veteran
oi iive weeks in Congress, related
to a small group oi his supporters
some of his first impressions of the
Washington political milieu He
opened the meeting with a stan-
dard “America is one of the last
bastions of Ireedom” speech He
proceeded with an uneasy ens
dorsement of Carter. “an in
telligent guy" who selected a
“strong, experienced cabinet."

Leach is Consistent in his refusal
to accept the proposed
Congressional pay increase The

Forum

by Dave McConnell
On February 10, the Food Sers
vice Subcommittee approved a
change in the mode oi servrce in
the Forum Grill, Beginning
Monday, February 21, the Grill will
provide beverage service and
snack foods during the hours of Hi
p.m,, Monday through Friday
There will be no hot [beds available
during that time. This adjustment
will allow for a savings of $2.700
annually in the Forum operation
The Forum Grill lost over $8,000
[irst semester, and appears headed
toward a total year loss oi 31590:}
$18,000 During first semester, the
Food Service tried to alter a wide
variety oi deli type sandwiches. a
salad bar every noon hour, and a
variety of discounw and specrals
Average sales per week were
around $1,750; however, the
consensus oi many Forum Grill

presidential commission. is bottled
up in committee and may never
be Subjected to a floor vote. Leach
feels that there is no ”less
defensible" way for the issue to be
handled. He is involved in a move
to use the unclaimed raise money
to establish Washington in
ternships ior high school students.

Leach says Carter has made
recent comments which indicate
that the President may reverse his
pre-election stance and support the
proposed B-l bomber. While
Carter's position seems unclear,
Leach is adamantly opposed to
spending deiense dollars on the
bomber,

Leach says that although the
Carter administration may alter
the programmatic emphasis oi the
U S \vellare system. there will be

a Substantial increase in public
serVice jobs which he irowns upon
as “expensive and sea-
gcnei-ative,” He advocates a
clinical income maintenance
program based on the economic
philosophy oi conservative
University of Chicago cconomist
Milton Friedman. The plan calls
tor a direct incomc transier which
decreases as the individual's
earnings increase.

Leach was one of several
representatives to introduce a bill
which would give tax advantages
to small businesses that hire eight
to ten employees per year, tin,
promoting increased employment
in the private sector.

Leach how is serving on two
House committees; Bankin
Finance, and Urban Ailairs, a
the Post Oliice and Civil Service
Committee. The Banking Coma
mittee, composed at 14
Republicans and 29 Democrats,
examines legislation dealing with
international trade, monetary
policy, and regulation or the HUD
agency.

Leach says the real challenge of
the next iew years is the location
and exploration oi viable alter
native energy sources. The feeling
in Congress is that soon the U.S,
will be channeling substanti l
sums of money into research a ‘
development of solar one}?
processes. ‘.

Leach urges complete U s. with
drawal from South Korea. He
terms the bribery oi member?
Congress in return ior supporti
foreign aid and commitment of
troops to South Korea “the worst
scandal in the history at the US,
Congress."

When asked his position on U.S.
Involvement in the Panama Canal
Zone. Leach replied that it is “now
more a question oi international
security than one oi national
sovereignty " He urges the U.S. to
stand firm in its negotiations to
keep the Panama Canal ‘
