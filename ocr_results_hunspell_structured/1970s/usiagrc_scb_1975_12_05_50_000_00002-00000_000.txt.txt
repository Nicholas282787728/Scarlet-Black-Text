Liquor livens nightlife ‘

by Bob Meyer

it one ever becomes discouraged
or disgusted with the atmosphere
at the Pub, 1 recommend that they
try one of the nine bars that are in
the downtown area of Grinncll
(Unfortunately this reporter was
unable to cover Wayne's Steak
House’s lounge.) Believe it or not,
each oi these bars is geared toward
a different clientele, each one has a
character all its own

Christy’s is one of the few bars in
town that has an elegant at»
inosphere, but the ownership
doesn’t seem too interested in the
student patronage. Prices, in
comparison to other bars, are
exorbitanti

l-ie charges an unbelievable 45
cents for a nine ounce draw, The
shots cost 85 cents and are usually
iilled up a little below the jigger,

The only other elegant bar in
town iSJ.D.‘5 This quaint little bar
has the Widest selection of beers
and drinks Unfortunately these
drinks, as well as the beer, include
the cost of the atmosphere. Bob
Globus, the owner, runs the most
extensive bar in town, The prices
are high because J D.‘s offers the
customer more luxurious aca
commodations than the other bars.
Globus particularly prides himselt
on the fact that he is the only bar in
Iowa which offers Export beer on
tap.

The real charm about this place
is the fact that the students can
order the fanciest drinks in town,
J.D.‘s can give the customer some
of the most exotic drinks
imaginable: Grubowski and the
Blobus Gimlet. It classy drinks are
what you're after, then I recomr
inend that you irequent this bar.

The opposite of J.D ’5 would
have to be Duffy's which offers the
best prices in town. There are iew
occasions when a person can iind a
better deal in Grinnell. The beers
are iiiteen ounces and cost only «to
cents. Unlike J D.’s, Dutfy’s floors
are not carpeted and the people in
the bar don't like exotic drinks,
These people are satisiied ivith
beer and straight liquor, If you are
a struggling and starvlng student,
then Duffy's is the best place for
you to drink cheaply.

Link's is one of the few bars in
town that caters to the local high
school crowd, Upon entering the
bar you will find a substantial
number oi people with young
looking faces. The owner and his
wife and son run the establish-
ment, The owner’s wife is by far
the funniest bartender in town and
I can guarantee you that she will
give you at least one laugh per
drink.

Link’s biggest attraction is its

games, It has tour pool tables and
one pinball machine named “Big
Strike t, it you manage to beat the
machine, the house offers a free
drink. Since the game only costs a
dime, i recommend that you play
this game, A word of Caution,
though, this is not your or
dinary pinball machine.

There are two bars in town that
are located in basements. The first
of these is The corner Here you
can get a great dinner for $6.00 and
top the meal on with a caraie oi
wine This is one of the few bars in
town that offers wine, The
Burgundy, Rose, Chablis, and
Beaugulais are only $2.99 a carate,

Christy’s
Dutiy‘s
Number
Longhorn
Tracks

J as
Corner
Link’s

The cost per glass oi these wines is
35 cents. Michelob on- tap is
sold tor 40 cents, and the bar also
offers Heineken for $1.10 a bottle.
Thelighting is dim and the decor is
done in reasonably good taste, The
place tends to be quiet except
on occasions when the owner hires
a hand. If you are searching tor a
bar to calm your nerves, then the
Corner is the place to go

The other basement bar is The
Tracks This place is very new. It
still hasa musty odor and the doors
don’t. always in the doorway.
These problems, however, will be
repaired in the near future, The
juke box here is very special, it is
extremely oldrt'ashioned and so are
its prices: a quarter for iour songs.
The drinks aren’t as good a deal as
the juke box, The prices are
reasonable but the bartender

doesn't pour them as generously as
he could. For those seeking cn-
tertainment, ThC Tracks oticrs a
T.v., a dark lounge, and a game
room in the back.

The Number, like The Tracks,
tries to get its business irom the
college kids The owner, Brian
Mullah, has numerous ideas to
attract customers: movies every
Tuesday and Thursday, iiiteen
cent draws every Tuesday and
Thursday, and live music as oiten
as he can find it. Unlike the!
Longhorn, the Number has a dance
noor and’a stage that can hold a
large hand. Upstairs there are
three pinball machines, a foosbal'i‘
game, and a pool table

The Number oiiers the second
best prices in town except tor the
fifteen cent draws, which are a.
number one deal. Mullan‘s hard
liquor has very little variety,
although the prices are as
reasonable as they could possibly
be. On special occasions Mullan
has Tequila shots tor 25 cents each.
The Number always seems to have
something special ior its
customers, and I can almost
guarantee a good time there on a
weekend when the proprietor has'
arranged for a band

The Longhorn, however, seems
to be the college favorite. The
place is clean, the prices are good.
and there is always some en
tertainment on the weekends. The
bar oiiers you iree pretzel sticks
with your beers and it has one of
the largest liquor cabinets in town, ,
On top of the wide range oi drinks&
the Longhorn has its grill open to
late ours oi the night. The barmaid
on the evening shift is quite a
character and is fun to joke with
However, let me warn you that she
will not tolerate any use oi vulgar
language, lfyou can avoid hassling
the barmaid, then you will most
likely have an enjoyable time at
the bar,
