The Scarlet and Black

Jewish Grinnelliuns Need Unity

by Linda Calkins

The Associated Jewish Students of
Grinnell College need more unity and
opportunities for establishing Jew‘
ish identity, according to Ave Mach»
tiger, chairman oi the organization.

The organization itself is loosely
structured, and has no regular meet—
ings and no constant membership. A
small percentage oi the Jewish stu—
dents on campus is really active;
however, when activities or events
are sponsored, interest increases
considerably.

Holidays such as Yom Kippur and
Rosh Hashanah are events for which
the organization provides transpore
tation to Des MDines, and on those
occasions active participants somee
limes reaches a hundred.

One large event sponsored by the
group is Jewish Cultural Weekend,
this year tentatively scheduled [or
April 25-30 -~ tentatively because
Black Martyrs Weekend has also
been Scheduled for the same time,
This would result in a conﬂict of
hours and space.

The committee (or this year’s
weekend is Danny Moss, Eric Queen,
and Jack Doppelt. The weekend inc
cludes movies, speakers, entertaine
ment and Jewish food, and will fea-
ture speaker Steven Schwarzschild
philosophy professor at Washington
University in St. Louis. and enters
tainer, Tova Ronni, Isrileli singer.

During Passover the group will
sponsor a Seder, a meal which has
a special order and manner ofserve
ing Present for this will‘he Rabbi
Jay Goldberg, Des Moines.

One of the accomplishments of the
group includes gelling Sagarto serve

special mods during passover- for
the Jewish students. The students
have also asked for and received
substitutions when Sagn serves ham
or pork for those who prefer not to
eat it for religious reasons, To me
sure that this remains in effect, a
permanent document is being drawn
up in case of personnel change onthe
Saga staii.

The most important thing ior which
the group is responsible this year is
the hiring of Harold Kasimow, relige
ious studies instructor ior next year.
His hiring will not only benefit the
department oi religious studies,
helping in the movement to make it
a separate department from Philos-
ophy, but will also beheiit n wider-
range or people than those interested
in Jewish Studies

Mr Kasimow will be otter-mg such
courses as introduction to Judaism,
Contemporary Jewish Theology, and
Jewish Mysticism, and will take
charge of the present World Relic
gions course. Once these courses
are oltered, many Jewish and non-
Jewish will probably take advantage
of them, but the Associated Jewish
Students have been the impetus bee
hind these moves,

in addition to the courses, Mr.
Kasimow is sending a recommended
book list for the library to increase
the present collection which does not
otler necessary topics in Judaism.
The Library now has little on cone
temporary lsrael or the Kibbutz,
but more is altered on European
Jews before the Russian revolution
and Jewish theology, Included dee
linitely on next year’s acquisitions
is the Encyclopedia Judaica,

According to Ave Machtigei, Mr.
Kasimow has indicated interest in
helping to establish the campus unity
which is now lacking among Jewish
students. He has offered his home as
an open house on Friday nights next
year tor those desiring to rap and
discuss problems which are unique
to them, This kind of interest and
involvement should establish an
identity which until now has been

totally absorbed into the Grinch
campus lite until it is no longer
maintained with separate cultural
life and activities, a “state oi noth-
ingness,” Ave said.

Although the group has done more
this year than in previous years, it
is not dominant and iorcetul. The
hiring of Kasimow was just a start
in establishing some accomplishe
merits leading to more permanent
things. The basic aim is to fulfill
the needs oi Grinnell's Jewish stue
dents by bringing to the attention
of the proper people the necessity
of oilering Grinnell students the
Jewish culture and religious and
spiritual iultillnient.

Seniors look To Service Jobs, law School

by Anita Myerson

With the second Semester almost
hali over, many people may wonder
what this year’s seniors are planning
on doing next year, Many oithe sen—
iors wonder themselves. Alter living
for up to four years in the idealistic
world of Grinilell, which one Often
fails to notice until one is away from
Gi‘ilinell, many oi the seniors are
trying to find something in the “real
world” that they can d0--Somethlng
that does not Clash wltli their ideals
«especially if they decide not to go
to graduate school. Alter being in
school tor 16 or 17 years, is it not
about time to try to contribute to
Society? A look in booklets such as
Vocations for Social Change and
Invest Yourself shows thdttllere are
possibilities for helping to change
societye—especially it you will agree
to work for subsistence wages,

Pam Wrightman and Prudence
Mllite, the two resident advisers
who run the Career Services thice,
are able to list some trends that
they see with respect to seniors.
Despite the fact that people who dee
iinitely are interested in graduate
school tend to talk to professors
rattler than to the Career Services
Office, they can see the lollowmg
trends

(1) A wish to do something worth
while to serve or change the society,
This is not necessarily a lifetime
commitment, but a wish to do this
for a few years

(2) Some people want to get out of
academia entirely for a few years
to get different types of experience.
Some just want to do anything non-
academic, while others have spool-
iic interests, such as crafts.

(3) Others have quite definite ideas
or interests, such as workingabroad
(Kibbutzes seem popular), working
in a museum, working ior service-
type organizations, doing environ»
mental studies, etc. Marjory Daly
was able to add interests in tree
schools, in torestry, in libraries,
media. and a Wide variety of other

applied areas.

With respect to more speCilic
tields, Marjory, Pam and Prudence
see the tollowing trends-

Graduate school: There seems to
be a trend towards applied tieldsee
especially towards law this year.

Business: The interest in business
seems to be low. Only about 5 grade
hates go on to MBA programs each
year.

Teaching: Jobs will be searched
out by a number or graduates, des-
pite the iact that they are scarce. A
nninber of people have indicated an
interest in teacher corps.
Government: A number oi people
seem interested in government Jobs.

Arrested 0n

James A. Diers, a freshman at
Grinnell College, was arrested the
9th of February outside Oi the Grin-
nell Post Office and charged with
possession ol marijuana. The mane
juana was wrapped inside at a packe
age which Diers had come to claim.

in order to get an accurate repre~
sentation of the [acts involved In this
case, the 5&3 conducted aninterview
with Grinnell Chiet oi Police Bill
Peters “We were tipped oil that he
had marijuana, we had a search wars
rant, we waited for him to come and
get his package, he got his package
and walked out, and we arrested
him.”

Diers denies any knowledge that the
parcel he was receivmg contained
marijuana.

In the course of the 5&8 interview,
an inquiry was made into what gen-

A look at the Grinnell Magazine's
articles about the graduates M ’70
and Y71. showed,

(1) The number going on to school:

as ('70), 65 (’71)

(2) The number doing service or
non-academic studies a ('70),
13 (”71)

(a) The number working other than
in (2): 26(’70),19('71)

(4) The number whose situations
are unknown: 95 ('70), 112 (’71).

Pain and Prudence saw the trends
at this year as being not too diiierent
from the past few years, but quite
ditterent lrom the early ’60’s. Then
many more people went into graduate
school, business. or government.

One thing that may hinder the Chane
ces of doing serViceevolunteer work
is that many agencies are having to
undergo budget cuts. They also eme
phaslzed that the current state of the
economy may iorce graduates to take
jobs that are not commensurate with
their educational background,

Drug Charge-

eral procedures the police departe
merit lollows in reacting to tips it
receives. Chief Peters replied that
he acts “...on any tip i get, but..,we
get a lot oi ialse alarms .

to use your own common sense.”

When the SELB asked specifically
about rules which might require the
Grinnell Department or Police to
cooperate with iederal or other
agencies on a case, Chiel Peters
responded, “Let’s put it this way.
It a tederal agent comes into Grin»
nell, has got something and wants
help, he's entorcing the law, and my
job is eniorcing the law, so...I give
him 100% cooperation."

When questioned, the Chief come
merited, without further elaboration,
that “there were other agencies in—
volved" in the Diers case.

In the interest of Diers, Chief
Peters requested that the 5&3 stick
strictly to reporting the iacts in
volved in this case, because “he
hasn’t had a trial, and i want him to
get a lair trial ” From here Diers’
case will go to district court.
