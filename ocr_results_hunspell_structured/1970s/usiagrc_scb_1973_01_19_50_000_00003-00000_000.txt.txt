years ago. has been an important
member or the college community

MainzPub IIot Wanted In Gardner

To the Editors:

We, the undersigned residents of
Main Hall, state our opposition to
the location of a pub in Gardner
Lounge. We state the tollowing re—
asons,

1) Many or us, in addition to stur
dents trom the rest or the Quad, use
Gardner Lounge for studying. Those
of us residing in Main cannot use
our own lounge tor studying, be
because the television is constantly
in use. Gardner is especially Valu-
able late at night, from eleven
o’clock on, when the library is
closed and one's roommate does
not wish to be disturbed. Locating
the pub in or oit Gardner Lounge
would destroy it as a study lounge.
due to noise and the passingthrough
at large numbers at students.

2) There is a strong possibility
ot— annoyance to Main residents. A
problem or noise coming up through
the elevator shaft and disrupting
sleep or studying exists. We are
also worried about the prospect ot
vandalism. The pub should not be
located in a residence hall or in
a place with easy access to a re
sidence hall.

We have already, at two meetings
with proponents or the pub, voiced

was as close as he got to the front
lines. In 1944, he received an hon-
orable discharge and returned to the
town of Grinnell.

Over the years Dave has seen many
personalities pass theouglicrinnell,
Among them. he remembers Eisenr
bower, Truman, Hoover, Tait, Wilr
son, Goldwater and Martin Luther
King. The college days cicary Coopr
er he remembers quite well. Coopr
er, contrary to popular opinion, was
not expelled but lett prematurely
to Care [or his mother, Dave re—
cnlls

He also remembers when the Cons
gregational Church was housed in
ARH Auditorium while a new house
or worship was being ereCted, And
it would be incomplete to mention
those days, of course, Without ace
knowledging “l-lell Night,” where
treshmen, garbed iii pajamas and
nightshirts, were expected to par-
ade around downtown to Comemr
ornte their first college year.

Even now Dave continues to work.
He keeps yards raked and gardehed
as well as helping out at the May
ilower House, which he once helped
to build, In addition to his many
friends at the college Dnve receives
much companionship Irom his tour
sisters in Grinnell.

He and the college have enjoyed
a long and cordial relationship, but
despite his youthiul behavior Dave
wants it to remain non-academic

Return to the college as a student?
He shudders at the thought.

it has been possible to conserve
a large amount of badly needed
natural gas tor use in the heating
plant,

Last week’s surplus, which was
delivered to the heating plant on
Friday, heated the entire campus
for seven hours. This week’s un-
seasonably mild weather has also
helped to alleviate the problem.
More mild weather is expected both
here and throughout the nation, and
this, coupled withyednesday's liltr
ing of fuel oil import quotas, should
iurther ease the pinch.
