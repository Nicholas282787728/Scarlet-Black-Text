Georgia’s on our minds

The controversy surrounding Programs and Activities,
Counselor Georgia Dentel has reremerged this week, as
negotiations over her job description continue.

Judging from what is on the public record. the specific

issues in this latest installment of the Dentel controversy'

bear little similarity to those raised in the fall of 1976 by the
now infamous “administrative reorganization.” At that

time, Dentel and Kathy McCluskey were fighting for their
jobs. Then, when Dentel was finally signed in January, 1977,
she was given only a part-time contract with a reduction in
1733'-

TODAY, DENTEL‘s primary concern is not retaining her
job or even getting a better salary, Her negotiations with the
administration involve more pedestrian issues, such as
whether she should maintain predetermined office hours and
whether she should be required to submit a yearly report
to the administration regarding the share of SGA money
spent on social activities. Although the specific issues of
this current controversy differ‘from those of 1976, there are
nonetheless disturbing parallels.

in 1976 the administration attempted to phase out
Dentel's position without consulting students. This year, it
'has offered her a job description without consulting the
SGA. The administration's argument has been that
their relationship with Dentel is an in-house concern. This
claim would be valid in any other instance. Dentel's position
is not that of a typical administrator. She is primarily
responsible for the quality of the college's social program.
This program encompasses the efforts of the major concerts,
minor concerts, movies and public events committees of the
college. it is a facet of campus life that is obviously very
important to the student body.

MOREOVER. AS Programs and Activities counselor,
Dentel plays a key role not only in advising students on how
their money should be spent, but in helping to procure major
acts for the campus. Given the fact that she plays such
a crucial dual role, student input into administrative
decisions concerning either the maintenance of her position
or her job description is entirely appropriate

A second, and equally disturbing parallel between the
administrative reorganization and the current difficulties is
the apparent illogical behavior of the administration.
Georgia Dentel is clearly one of the most effective ad-
ministrators at Grinnell. Her record for bringing top-flight
acts to this small, midwestern campus is unmatched
anywhere in the country. In the past two years alone, she has
managed to bring to Grinnell Julie Harris. Ely Ameling,
Joan Armatrading. Mel Lewis and Thad Jones, Bill Evans.
the Nashville Grass and Norman Blake, among others. With
this kind of record, it is clear that she is extremely effective.
To insist in 1976 that she could be replaced without a per-
manentdrop in the quality of the social program, or to'argue
today that she needs to maintain office hours because other
administrators do so, is to overlook how effective she really
is.

Thus. the current Dentel controversy bears two strong
similarities to the administrative reorganization of last fall.
Both hold disturbing implications for student input into
student related decision-making. At the same time, neither
the reorganization or this current episode exhibit logical
administrative decision-making.

To the editor: We wish to draw lhe
aliention of the campus come
munily to the deterioration m the
attitude of members of the college
administration towards students
and the student government. In
the past year, we have seen
numerous examples of lhe adr
ministration's disregard for
student Views on issues that
directly and materially affect
students For example, the view of
the Student Curriculum Council
regarding the change in faculty
evaluation methods was
disregarded. the SGA boycott
policy was ignored in favor oi a
policy which had been rejected by
the Joint Board, Dean Walker has
removed from the Student
Government (he privilege ofi
calling Skip Day. and there has
been non~enforcemenl 0f Studenl

th 1t

rights to an active role In EPC
decision making. Furthermore, the
current negotiations between the
administration and Georgia Dentel
demonstrate that this disregard of
sludeni Views is an ongomg
problem.

While any of these actions, taken
alone, can be seen as minor or even
trivial. taken cumulatively they
demonstrate a growing disregard
for sludenls' Views and distrust of
Student Government. Mr Turner's
comment that the SGA‘S role is to
merely comment on social policies
written by a cpmmitlee chaired by
Dean Tederman Is illustrative of
his regard [or student opinion
