Bring Back The

Al - '
, umnik

With a number of alumni members on campus for workshops and
leadership sessions for the“weekend we would like to take the
opportunity to suggest a program -for Grinnellalumnithat has come
to our knowledge.

In a program initiated by Albion College, alumni are allowed to
return to the school and take courses for one—half tuition cost
provided that there is room in the particular class or classes that
they prefer to attend. Students are allowed to take classes on a full
or part time basis and the college makes room and board available
at the regular cost to other students.

Non-graduates are allowed to return on the one-half tuition program
provided that they attended the school for at least two years, left in
good academic standing and have not attended any accredited college
or university in the last five years.

Bob Eggleston, director ~of alumni parent relations for Albion
College said of the program, “The program was designed to help
fill some of our classrooms and also to give the alumni something
of value in the educational field.”

Many students graduate with a major ina given field and decide at

. a later date to pursue an interest in another area. This plan
would allow alumni to return and pursue further undergraduate
work at a reduced cost and broaden the scope of the liberal arts
education for the individual. '

The recent admission statement issued by the trustees stressed
the need for both quality and diversity of students at Grinnell
naming as one of their three admissions priorities the sons and
daughters of alumni. Perhaps consideration would be given to

. extending admissions priorities to alumni themselves.

In the second year of the program at Albion, 25 alumni took ad
vantage of the program to return to their alma mater. The addition
of even this limited number of students because of varying age,
background and experiences out of school could well be the additive
that diminishes some of the homogenity of the' student body.

The cost of such a program is minimal, though the benefits gained
are shared by all concerned.

The Rumor Mill

Grinnell, as a relatively Closed community, is subject toa
severe case of ”rumormania" at any time of crisis or near
crisis. ‘

The past week has provided two strikingly different examples
r' one concerning music, and the other concerning the wave of
illness.

, A rumor first began circulating about ten days ago that a pro—
p05§l_‘3§§ pending to eliminate music as a major at Grinnell.
A number of music students expressed alarm to this newspaper,
and to SGA officials, about the supposed cutback.

Further investigation revealed that the only basis for this
story was a paper prepared by a faculty member discussing this
possibility in theoretical terms. No serious harm was caused by
this rumor, but a number of people became upset prematurely.

’ The second situation was real, and the rumors surrounding it
were more serious.

Calls began reaching the Scarlet and Black office about 7:00
Tuesday night, all with the same basic message: anumber of
students who had eaten dinner on South campus were suffering

i from food poisoning.

By morning, as the illness spread to other members of the
College community, that rumor began to die. But, it was replaced
by a variety of other “causes” too numerous to mention.

The constant speculation did nothing to relieve the suffering
of those who were ill, and did a great deal to proVide needless
worry for those who were not yet affected.

College administrators and staff, who desparately needed time
to search for the real cause, were forced instead to spend time
denying the false charges.

Words like “epidemic” were casually tossed about, with little-
thought of what effect they might have if transmitted to the outside
world. Grinnell does not operate in a vacuum -- by early Weds
nesday morning, the plight of the sick students was being flashed.
across the state by news wire. Imagine an anxious parent seeing
the headline EPIDEMIC STRIKES GRINNELL when such was not
the case.

Grinnell has always had the tendency to produce rumors when-
ever the slightest opportunity has been presented. Perhaps a
bit less speculation, and a bit more silence until all the facts
are in, would make Grinnell a more peaceful and less worried
community. i

The Alumni Tour
Land in there, one ot our most brilliant .

chemistry students working on an experiment.’

To the Editors:

A newspaper is a unique endeavor
which is oftentimes better judged
by what it excludes than what it
offers its readers, When something
is censored from print, the issue
takes precedence over the daily
palaver as to whether an event was
covered accurately or written co»
gently.

I believe it is imperative that Gri-
nnell students are aware of what
did not appear in the last edition of
the S k B and the reasons for its
omission. I wrote a column last
week which I did not deem out of
the ordinary 'in any Way. It included
the use of a common proianily, a
term used more openly on this
campus than books. The story dealt
with a friend of mine. The column
was censored because of the use
of profanity and the possibility of
libel.

I was flabbergasted when I rea—
lized that what this meant was that
common profanity had not appeared
in the S do B. I had assumed that
it the occasion arose, such words
would be printed perfunctorily.'This
is a college newspaper. Who would
be offended?

That is when John Wylie, or Com»

stockean editor, let me in on his
conception oi the editor’s role. He
Said that parents and trustees might
be offended and that no matter what
I think, the paper needs their money.
To me, John, once you start run-
ning the students’ newspaper acc-
ording to What parents and trustees
want to read, you can pack your
scissors and red pencil and join
the college relations staff.

To be more precise, the use Of
that particular profanity was 955v
ential to the column. It was not
just thrown in for meretricious or-
namentation, It did not even pertain
to the profane definition oftheterm,
In fact, it was perfectly illustrative
of the common, non-offensive usage
that the word connotes in our pre
sent socity, college or otherwise.

John, if you indeed have assumed
the role of editor-in-Chief of moral
preservation, then kindly keep such
conspicuous and vulgar heads as
"Sexuality Discussed” off the front
page. That story last Week drained
all my remaining puritanical values
with the intrusion of such words as
“homosexual" and “masturbation,”
It’s disgusting enough that suchdisr
cussions are taking place. Do you

Socialist local Decry Allende Death

To the Editors:

On Tuesday morning Chile’s us

trained and armed military over»

threw the democratically elected‘
government of Salvador Allende.

President Allende later committed

suicide in the presidential residence

in Santiago in order to avoid caps

ture. The economic crisis that led

to this overthrow is not the fault
of the Popular Unity’s leftist res

froms. During Allende’s first year,
output and wages jumped 50%, But
since then, there has been a sys-
tematic campaign by big busmess
interests in Chile, international co-
rporations, the us government, and
'the “multinational agencies” to pa-
ralyze the Chilean economy and
overthrow the government. When
Allende was ele‘cied, ITT and the
CIA hatched a plot for a coup but
it was later discovered and de-
ieated, The big copper corporations,
which were nationalized by a near

unanimous vote in the Chilean par- >

liamenl, waged a worldwide legal
campaign to have Chilean Copper,
the nations chief export, impound-
ed. The us government withdrew
all economic aid and waged a dip-
lomatic campaign against the Pop-
ular Unity government. Worse than
that the US has used it's dominant
position in the IMF, the World
Bank, and other agencies to preSr
sure them into cutting credits and

aid to the Chilean economy. The
international corporations with their
partner-monopolists in Chile have
raised prices, created scarcities,
gone on strikes and lock outs; all
with the aim of subverting demo-
cratic government. When the Right
lost ground in last Spring's elec-
tions (up vote increased from 35%
to 44%) the efforts to overthrow
the government became more des-
perate Rightist factions increased
the economic pressure and began
terror campaigns; executing trade
union and leitist political leaders,
blowing up power stations and pipe-
lines and attempting an abortive
coup in July.

Today they have succeeded. But
we do not ask you to demonstrate
in Solidarity with our brothers and
Sisters being Shot in the streets
of Santiago. We merely ask you to
note the Way Capitalists act to hold
on to their privileges, We ask you
to see which side the Wall Street
government supports in Chile and
around the world. We warn you that
someday this may happen in our
own country. We ask you to join
us in the light for peace and yus-
tice, that is in the struggle for 507
Cialism. But it is more than a Stru-
ggle, ii is a battle which we can
and must Win.

have to lend credence to them by
plastering the front page with cov-
erage?

As to the risk of libel, the party
in question wouldn't stand a chance,
The reference is not malicious or
defamatory, and the person is to-
tally content, even pleased, with the
column However, if you insist that
the only way you will print it is
if the person and his entire iamily
sign a statement that they will not
sue and have it notarized by the
President of the United Slates, then
so be it. After all, you are the
editor. And when you say with Nix-
onian conviction that printing the
column without that notarized letter
“would be setting a dangerous pres
Cedent," I must value your judg
ment.

John, it is too bad that you run
the student newspaper as if it were
a radio station; paranoid that the
FCC will close your doors. Watch

Crater Answers Shield

To the Editors:

1 must make reply to Robert Sh-
ields, who considers that any stu-
dent has the right to Teamster head
lettuce if none else is available,
and that two thirds of the student
body should not be allowed to im-
pose its will on the other third.
He proposes that head lettuce be
provided, for those who do not con—
sider the lives oi the lam workers
more important than their menu.

i agree that the students are ens
titled to a good balanced diet. it
good balanced diet, however, is quite
possible without head lettuce.

And ii the will of two thirds is to
be denied out oi respect for the ot—
her lhird, then in effect the min-
ority is ruling. Majority rule as
a matter of fact although it may
seem tyrannical to some is the only

Illﬂlli

logical means oi achieving democ-
racy when all are not in agreement,
The plan to leave the lettuce onthe
tables and let those boycott ii who
would boycott it is almost comical
to me. To buy at all is not to boy-
colt. Even those who had voted for
the boycott would find themselves
saying, “The lettuce is already
bought, the cause of the workers
will not be hurt it Ihave somehow."

But my basic rejection of the plan >

simply lies in this: I wish to attend
a college which made a fact of his
tory its support of California farm
workers in 1973.
