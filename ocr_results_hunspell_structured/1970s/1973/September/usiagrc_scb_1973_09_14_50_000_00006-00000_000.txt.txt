Palmer Involves Alum s

It is the inevitable fate of‘all

Grinnell Students that they will me-v

an different things to different peo-
ple and the degree otactive and sen»
timental involvement with the Coll—
ege will vary from person to per
son. The Alumni Office is organi~
zed to meet these varied needs of
the everourgeoning group of alumni.

Dorothy Palmer, a Grinnell ale
umna, is the Alumni Executive Dir-
ectort She is a member of the class
of 1962, a class that in many ways
marked the end of the old, tradir
tion’al Grinnell unchanged since
1912. The class of 1962 was thelast
class with Freshman requirements.

After graduation, Palmer spent a
year teaching in Central Africa on
a fifth year abroad program. She
then returned to Grinnell to marry.
in 1967, after receiving a degree
,in education and teaching in the
'Juliior High School, Palmer worked
as secretary on the Board ofDirr
ectors of the Alumni Association.

in 1971, she accepted her current
position as Alumni Executive Sec»
retary. Dorothy Palmer mused that
her attitude upon graduation from
Grinnell was not an attitude that

foreshadowed a career in alumni ,

relations.

Dorothy Palmer's job is basically
to corordinate the Alumni Office.
This office keeps the records of the
approximately 14,000 alumni ol
Grinnell, including biographical data
and Current mailing addresses ofall
alumni. The Alumni Office also
keeps the addresses oltheparents
of past and present students and of
lriends at the college. in general,
the people of the Alumni Office are
“resource people."

Specifically, the Alumni otlice

helps coordinate many on and on—
campus programs. 0n-cainpus pro-
grams include such events as the
Parents and Alumni weekend in the

The Class Agent System is an
extremely important and ettective
program in alumni relations The
program was initiated in 1947 in the
hope that each class agent will act

TYPING

primarily as a correspondent, notas
a fund raiser. Ei‘he agents, ranging
from the class of 1908 through
1973, try to keep Grinnellians in
touch with each other. Class lett-
ers are sent out about four times
a year posting alumni on news and
also providing an open forum tor
opinions of various members, All
in all, Dorothy Palmer states that
the Class Agent system tosters
a “spirit of class.“

Graduating classes seems to he
a concept that is dying in many
colleges However, according to
Palmer, Grinnell alumni enjoy mar
etlng and working with each other.
This is probably due to the efforts
toward a personal approach in all
Alumni Office dealings and also
enorts ot the Class Agents.
Dorothy Palmer is extremely sa-
tistied with her yob which to her,
is the best possible 10b in Grinnell,
The Job provides opportunities to
meet interesting people and in Palm-
er's opinion, Grinnell alumni are
particularly interesting and aggrese
sive people,

Economic Woes Examined In Collequium

by Ken Winokur
“The Economy” was the topic
of discussion for Tuesday's taculty
symposium Associate Dean, James
Hamilton presided over this dis
cussion, the second of the sympose
ium series The panel members
were Robert Vcertman and steven
Brenner oi the Economics depart
ment, and Waldo Walker dean ol

Review

the College.

The basic format of the meeting
was a debate between conservative
Brenner and Socialist Voertman,
with comment and questions thrown
in by Walker and the audience.

Voertman started the debate with
a short economic history of the
US, and then launched into Nixon’s

economic policymr lack there ot,
He used an amusing analogy com
paring Nixon’s policy with a (cute
ball game, with the President Cons
trolling the game plan and some-
times the rules, According to Vo-
ertman the most serious fault of
the president is a lack of “goal
identification.” This lack of dire
ection is shared by Congress, ec-
onomists, bankers, journalists etc.
He acknowledged that Nixon had
taken a step in the right direction
by imposing controls on wages and
prices, but that it was only a tem-
porary emergency measure. Voert-
man indicated that a long term po-
licy of controls, was necesssary,
although it is an idea alien to many
proponents of free enterprise.
When Brenner was given his ch-
ance to speak he rehutted most of
what Voertman had lust said. He st»
ated that the goals for the national
economy were clearly identified. N0
inllation, no unemployment, a bale
ance of trade, and to remain a
first rate international power. The
problem as he saw it was choosing
from these identified goals.

Having said this, Brenner made
the logical next point-an explana-
tion of why controls were not he—
cessarily effective. He stated that
stiff controls might create their

own income distribution inequities,

and could cause shortages in var»
ious products, He also noted the
possible political problemsvrelated
to bias might become a factor. His‘
final point was that the real probe
lem of inflation was being felt in
the agricultural areas.

Walker received his turn, and.
although not an economist, did much
more than just balance on some of
the younger panel members. Before
anyone had quite recovered from
his opening jokes, Walker opened
his pandora’s box oi pointed ques-
tions. Once released, these evil
beasts quickly filled the room, an(
eventually landed on the shoulders
of Brenner and Voertman, Where
they must still remain since they
were never successfully answered.

Comments were made on Walker's
questions, and the session was op-
ened to audience questions. in res-
ponse to a question Voertman said
that he did not feel that inflation
was a serious problem, contrary
to what the press and the publir
felt. Several members of the aud--’
ience were noticably agitated by
this statement until Brenner ass-
erted his agreement. The audience
seemed pacified when they reali-
zed that the two opposing panel~
ists both agreed on this issue, ma-
king it seem a credible opinion.
