Daniorih: A Patent Professor

1 by Brad Bauknecht
Grinnell College, so the literature
says, is noted for its highly qualir
lied faculty, one which takes a vital
interest in students and their eduCr

' ations,

From listening to the lengthy dis'
sertations of many an opinionated
upperclassman, it seems that the
general consensus of opinion con-
cerning the faculty is surprising—
Iy_in agreement with the above state»

. ment. Apparently, the administra—

' tion has done a fine Job of Convinc~
ing talented men and women to her
come a part of the Grinnell Collr
ege community.

Among these talented people is a
man who has been part of the chem—
istry department for 25 years, He
is Joseph D. Daniorth,

Danforth, in conjunction with a
teaching philosophy which has seen
,-many changes over the years, has
brought to Grinnell a wealth oi ex-

," perience in professional activities
, which relate to chemistry.

Danforth held over 20 patents in
the field before he left a position
as head of the chemical products
development department oi a large
oil til-m. Since then he has added
even more patents to his credit.

Despite this large number oi p0r
tential money-makers, surprising,
ly little has come of them finan-
ciaiiy,

“All inventors signed over rights
to income from each patent f0r$l,H
‘he noted.

E'As tar as later patents go, Dan—
forth comments, “There have been
ﬁve or six patents obtained based
on work done at Grinnell, only one
of which still has potential value,”

The one remaining patent is in
the form of a device which meav

‘ sures, identifies, and records very
precisely, small ‘amounts at volar
'tile decomposition products This

complicated instrument applies to
studies which concern the decompr
osltion of solid substances as they
are heated; a very important cone
cept in the construction industry.
The prototype operates during re
search in Room 224 or the Science
Hall. ,

Outside of scientific changes in
the past two decades, Danforth is
most interested in those metamorr
pheses which have occurred in his
own educational philosophy. Many or
these changes are due, in part, to
the radically transformed views oi
students in the last 25 years

“Students who didn’t understand or
whose interest couldn’t be aroused,”
he observed, "apparently considers
ed it to be their own fault and not
that of the professor. This seems
no longer to be true, and it is pro—
bably better this way, though it is
more difficult for the professor.”

In comparison to the students of
ten or twenty years ago, Daniorth
comments, “Students of today seem
to question the mode of education.
it they work at something and don’t
understand it or find it dull, some»
one other than themselves must be
at fault.” ,

“They may or may not be right,”
Dantorth adds, “but at the price
they pay, we must certainly listen
and try to improve,”

A recent innovation which Dan~
iorth (as well as many other no-
ulty members) iinds interesting is
the freshman tutorial, Although it
takes more of his time than an
average course With the same i'iiiiTIr
her or pupils, the results he has
seen have thus far been encourage
ing.

“This is a real learning situae
tion tor the student and iaculty
member alike,” he comments. “Doe

ing the work on his own, the stu-
dent will certainly not come up with
all the goodies that he would write
down in a lecture by an expert,
He Will, however, learn how to go
about acquiring information, learn
to direct his own planning, and will
learn to write effectively.”

The changes in the student himr
sell have gone hand in hand with
changes in educational methods,
baniorth serves on a iaculty commr
lttee investigating some of these
new methods, Among them is the
much talked about “Keller Plan”

The Keller approach involves the
utilization of programmed learning
on the college level in order to
help cut down on the everrincreas-
ing price oi higher education. in
many cases, this method has shown
excellent results in certain types of
learning environments

Danforth, however, considers its
advantages in the light oi his own
views on education; “Programmed
learning is the most efficient edUr
cational process I have seen ii_
the objective of education is to elr
icit certain preconceived responses
to a given set of stimuli,”

His main criticism of these new
and eiiicient methods is that they,
“...present the material on a sil-
ver platter, so to speak. They must
not," he continues, “replace the
less organized methods oi learn-
ingi Things one really needs to know
are rarely organized. Experts will
oiten give lectures that are un»
clear Books and articles are some,
times in error or at best confused."
“Yet,” he concludes, “thesearethe
areas in which trained and intellie
gent persons are needed to bring
order out of chaos and understand-
ing but oi confusion.”

The Contemporary Amuhus

Editor’s Note: This is Part ii in a
three—part series on the Amana
colonies.

by Douglas Halsey

"Where the hills recede from the'

plain of the lowa like the steps of
a Greek theatre, there nestle the
villages oi our beloved Amana
in this way Charles Selzer, pres-
ident of the Amana Church Society
described the Setting of the Amana
colonies. But long ago in many
respects, the Amana villages have
remained in this condition to the
present day.

The Amanas today, as always, are
marked by n friendliness which is
nearly worldrreknowned. This "ge»
mutlichkeit” is pervasive through-
out the colonies, here one of the
basic aims is not to become overly
commericalized. Although inevitab—
ly some tourists arrive expecting
to find dusty streets traversed by
horse-drawn wagons and sombre-l
claii citizens, iew are disappointed
by the more modern appearance of
the colonies ior they‘ have a wealth
of history and produce all their
own products.

The Amana Society operates sev-
eral iactories, a low of which, like
the clock lactory, still work in the
old tradition of hand—manufacturing.
Woolens and furniture are manu-
factured along with the distinctive
Amana wineries, bakeries, meat
markets and other shops which have
made Amana products famous th-
roughout Iowa and much oi the rest
of the country.

Without a doubt the most distinc-
tive modern aspect of the Amanas
is the relrigerator iactory. Unique
in its Own respect, it “is a blend
oi the Amana of yesterday with the
science oi manuiacturing anddesign
oi today.“ For instance, the factory
broke with tradition by creating an
upright ireezer, and “contactfreez-
ing" for safer food storage. It also
was one of the iirst, ii not theiirst,
to introduce a refrigerator/freezer
combination with the freezer on top
and the side-by-side reirigerator/
freezer.

Amana Refrigeration is also with
out a doubt the most commerical as—
pect of the colonies. The plant cov~
ers nearly 600,000 squareieet and
employs nearly 1,600 persons; al-
most the size of the colonies them-
selves, The Amanas also host their
own Holiday Inn featuring cooks tr-
ained in the Amana German style,

Despite the modern transitions wh-
ich had to take place in 1932, his»
tory is still very much a part of
the lives of the Amana inhabitants,
One or the most scenic areas in
the colonies is a ZOO-acre lily lake,
Legend has it that Indians brought
the lilies to the lake and harvested
the tubers for food. Anotherhistoric
landmark is a tall brick chimney
dating from 1580 which is still
connected to the Amana Refrigera»

tion plant,

Although the Amanas are, in their
entirety, registered as a Historic
Landmark, of special interest to
the visitor is the Museum oi Am-
ana History, operated by the Arm
ana Heritage Society, Numerous at
her shops, houses and otherhistoric
buildings dot all seven oi the ville
ages.

Probably the most signiiicanttour-
ist attraction of the Amanas is the
annual “Oktoberfest” this yeariall-
ing on Sept. 28 and 29. A miniature
version oi the original harvest ies-
tival celebrated in Munchen, Ger»
many, the fest ieatures Germanfolk
music and dancing, beer tent and an

Om»paepa band. It’s quite a Cele»
bratlon!

There are many features oi the
Amanas, too numerous to mention
here, which really make the colon-
ies the friendly, intimate and thor—
oughly enjoyable places that they
are. There is really only one way
to discover the Amanas, however.
Go there yourself.
