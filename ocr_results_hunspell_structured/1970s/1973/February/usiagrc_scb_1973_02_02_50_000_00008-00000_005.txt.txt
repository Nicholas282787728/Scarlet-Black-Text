children and having the additional occupation
of giving piano lessons in her home, she
is very happy being home while the children
are young. Mrs. Hamilton noted that Grills
hell is frustrating for women because there
are very tew part time jobs available,
but she is not sure how this can be changed
and at the moment her children are too
small for it to really matter. She can
foresee that there may be a problem
alter they go to school it she wants a
job and Cannot find one, but for the present
she is content,

As taculty wives, these three women have
a part in both the college and the town;
some students and townspeople may become
involved to a degree through such means
as the Big Brother-Big Sister program and
the day Care center, but the faculty has the
unique position of also belonging to the
town. Both Mrs. Parslow and Mrs. Furniss
belong to a book club which is composed
of town women and faculty wives. Mrs. Ham-
ilton belongs to a similar book Club, andall
three find it easy to relate to the other
women in the club. Mrs. Hamilton thinks

it would be very easy to become isolated
from the town because of the built~in
social life at the college. She does not
think there is enough town-gown inter~
action, iinding that “people assume there
are barriers between town and college, but
with a little elfort the barriers really aren’t
there." She feels that ”a lot of the meeting
of the two is stopped because people assume
there is a problem, but she hasn’t tound
it particularly difficult to have both town
and college friends.

it is Mrs. Furniss’ beliet that belonging
to a church and getting involved in its work
is a good way to establish ties with both
townspeople and laculty. She is a member
of Churchwomen United, an interdenomina»
tional group which is mostly composed at
town women, and like Mrs. Hamilton and
Mrs. Parslow tinds no problem in getting
along with town women, Through her chili
dren, she has become friendly withmothers
of children attending the same schools.
To Mrs. Parslow the college is a source
of much pleasurable leisure such as con»
certs, plays, and lectures. She has found

a variety of friends among the faculty,
and likes the fact that they can just get
together without having a big allair. Faculty
trom many departments, not justthe French
staff or language statlgettogether, different
than in some other colleges. Mrs. Furniss
also enJOys concerts and lecturesshelikes
the fact that because Grinnell is a small
college one can get to know everybody on
the laculty Mrs. Hamiltonis very interested
in her husband’s work and what's going
on at the college, but doesn’t have time tor
much actual Contact with students except
for those who are good friends, and her
college babysitters, who she tinds Just
marvelous. Socially, she teels that the
college offers more than many small towns,
and that more guest perlormers have disr
tinctly improved the cultural lite by giving
it broader variety However, beyond the
college. there is not much social life in
the town except in private homes, Other
towns where there are no colleges have more
of a social and cultural life The Starting
of community theatre in Grinnell this tall
seems to Mrs Hamilton to be a good step
in that direction
