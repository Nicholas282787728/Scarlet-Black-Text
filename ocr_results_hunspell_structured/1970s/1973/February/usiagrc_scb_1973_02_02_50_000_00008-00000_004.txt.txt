Because a professor’s relationship with
students is principally academic, one does
not frequently consider faculty life, in—
cluding their families, outside of the eds
ucational sphere. In order to gain an his
sight into the lives of faculty wives, the
S5113 interviewed Michele Parslow, wife of
French professor Morris Parsluw, Ruth
Furniss, wife of Sociology professor Geo-
rge Furniss, and Cleo Hamilton, whose
husband, James Hamilton, lsAssociateDean
of Administration and assistant professor
of Economics.

The three women are very diverse in
background Michele Parslow was born in
France anti spent about twenty years there
before coming to the United States. After
spending the same length of time in the
States, She feels she is just about as much
American as she is French how. Ruth
Furniss was born in Denmark and came to
the United States in l959l Cleo Hamilton
is originally from rural South Dakota.
The Parslows spent two years in Prince-

ton, New Jersey, Six years in Chicago, and
three years on Long Island before coming
to Grinnell, where they have spent the last
eleven years. The Furnisses lived in New

York City for eleven years before coming
to Grinnell. Both of the Hamiltons were
students at Grinnell College. and returned
here five years ago after graduate school.
In general the women said they prefer
Grinnell to big City life. Mrs. Parslow be-
lieves that small towns are better places
for people with families. Since she doesn't
drive, she likes the fact that she can ride
her bike in Grinnell, which she does often
with her husband in the summer. Mrs.
Furniss sometimes misses the big city
atmosphere, but thinks that Grinnell offers
some things like clean air and Safety that
a city does not. While it's possible to have
anonymity in a big city, she feels that
there are some people who care about you
in Grinnell.

Grinnell as a place to raise children is
of particular importance to these women

as all three have families. Mrs. Parslow
is the mother of four children, ranging
in age from fourteen to twenty-one The
oldest attends Reed College in Portland,
Oregon, the next, Trestram, is a sopho-
more here at Grinnell, and the two young-
est live at home. The Hamiltons have two
small children, three-year-old Amy, and
Cary, who is eight months. Mrs. Furniss’
three children are in kindergarten, third
and fourth grade. Mrsl Hamiltoniinds Grin-
nell a great place to raise children be-
cause it’s so easy to get around Grinnell
and it’s SO safe. Mrs. Parslow and Mrs,

Furniss agree with her. While the city
has advantages such as plays and films,
says Mrs, Furniss, the freedom and indEr
pendence of a small townlike Grinnell make
up for it, In addition, the college facilities
offer some of a city’s advantages.

Mrs. Parslow, Mrs, Furniss, and Mrs.
Hamilton all feel that it is certainly pos-
sible to lead a fulfilling life in Grinnell,
depending on what you want in life. Mrs.
Parsluw finds that four children anda large
house keep her occupied, and deiinitelyteels
that her life centers around her family.
She says that she decided to get married
and have a family and that "my job is to
take care of them, not have someone else
do it. I enjoy it.”

"in a sense of fulfillment as far as finding
things i can do, Grinnell has been good,"
says Mrs. Furniss. Personally, she thinks
that you can find what you wantto make your
life full if you try. Groups are smaller
here, and she has found it easy to get
involved. Three young children and outside
activities such as church involvement and
her work with Bluebirds and Campfire
Girls keep her busy, For other possibilities,
she Stated that faculty wives can attend
lectures, concerts, etc., and take courses
at the college. However, there are some
limitations to Grinnell; Mrs. Furniss men-
tioned that is might be difficult to get a
lot) here. The small school system doesnot
allow for many teaching positions, and even
ions which require a practical education,
such as a secretary might not be available,
she said. Those faculty wives who want
to do graduate work have to make the trip
to Iowa City.

Mrs. Hamilton believes that you can find
things to fulfill your life anyplace; you just
have to work little harder at it in Grins
nell. Her deci 'on is to stay at home and
care for her children, and she emphasized
that this was her choice: ”I do it not be-
cause I have to but because 1 want to."
She feels that she would be doing the exact
same thing in a big city as in Grinnell.
Finding nothing dull about life with small
