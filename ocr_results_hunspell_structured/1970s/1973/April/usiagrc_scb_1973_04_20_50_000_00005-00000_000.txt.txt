To the Editors:

1 found Ms, David's letter a retre—
shingly honest assessment oftlle wh»
ite point of view on this campus as
far as the cluster effect is con—
cerned. Ms. David didn’t waste time
on pseudo segregationist rubbish.
Ms. David went past the pseudo»
liberal defactp racist tendencies
on this campus and attacked the real
bone of contention, the lack of de
cent rooms on this campus, This is
the spirit that made America great!

I agree with Ms. David. She den
serves a good room. After all, she
has, poor girl, “been on SGA,
participated in intercollegiate athe
lctics, been on a departmental EPC,
maintained a Dean’s list GPA” and
otherwise has earned enough Bro
ownie points to prove herselfworthy.

Shouldn’t this count for something?
1 mean, really, shouldn’t it? I say
that we should get Ms. David her
room. Give her a list of the rooms

they knew they were discriminating

Schmucks‘ You forgot the main rea-
son for the cluster effect is that
those Blacks who cannot abide the
thought of living with their Father’s
emasculator and their Grandmotr

have that insulation.

Any white schmuck who can’t see
the black blood on his hands is not
only a Schmuck, but blind as well.
In other words, if you aren’t part

Humor Wanted: Punch line Contest

by Jack ooppelt

As a proud student of Grinnell
College, i take to heart any dis—
paraglng,remarks about my instir
tution and its denizens. An often
played tune is that Grinnell Stu»
dents have no sense of humor, col-
lectively or individually,

I, for one, don't agree, but deem
it such a serious charge that i
find it necessary to find out, once
and for belly laugh all.

Two years ago, the National Lame
pooh sponsored a punch line con-
test, All aspiring humorists were
to mail in what they thought was a
riotous punch line to a nonexis-
tent joke Winners would receive
a year's subscription to the Lam—
puon. Contestants were limited
to one entry per letter,

Green: Former liberal Finally Sees Truth

To the Editors:

Speaking as an exe "soft-hearted
liberal”, 1 cannot too highly ap-
plaud the Scarlet and Black’s cour-
ageous decision to immortalize in
print the ringing phrases of the
most recent contributor to the dis-
pute over our Alma Mater’s hous-
ing policy--Miss Roxane Brown.

As though i had been a skeptic
at a sermon by Amy Semple Moe
Pherson, the revelations of Miss
Brown have opened my eyes to the
WORLD around me, and, in the cat-
hartic tradition of a Save-a-Soul
Mission, I desire no more than to

purge,my soul of the sins whichhave
stained it by a 'public confession
of my errors:

Yes! 1 was (though i blush to ad!
mit it now) a soft-hearted liberal,
believing, through some perversion
of rhetoric, that all men--and even
some women—should be Judged by
their merits, not by the color of
their skins. Little did I dream,
even here in Grinnell, that the death
of Martin Luther King Jr. had torn
from those he left the powere—
nay, even the very "frame of re-
ference" necessary--to conceive 01
such a state of affairs.

garments, and obscure my visage

Morris: Protests

To the Editors:

i want to express some of my
feelings concerning the current st-
ate of black/white relations (or non.
relations) on this campus as they
were focused by the performance
of Dr. Bobby Wright, a clinical
psychologist, who lectured last week
as part of the CBS sponsored Black
Martyrs Week program.

Although Dr. Wright‘s concern a-
bout the possible abuses oi techno—
logically sophisticated behavior
control techniques is morethanjus—
tiiiable in light of some of the more
frightening “advances” in the use
of electrical stimulation ofthe brain,
chemotherapy, and behavior modifir
cation techniques, his lecture was
almost totally devoid of substan—
tial information on these topics (to
my knowledge no particular EEG
patterns have been as yet identified
which are isomorphic with sexual
arousal, nor has it been shown that
direct electrical stimulation is capo
able of causing orgasm in humans).
Further, while ,it may indeed be
the case that President Nixon manir
fests certain personality character
istics in common with the psycho
path, Dr. Wright presented no evir
dance, clinical or otherwise, tosubr
stantiate his use of the term,
instead, Dr, Wright presented his
audience with the uSAagainstvyou
empty rhetoric to be the substitu-
tion of “European” for "hunky”,
Perhaps this recourse to fatuous

of thinking) that somehow, it Ide-
nied to myself that an individuals
race, Creed, or national extraction
identified him to the extent that
his other characteristics were com-
pletely submerged; that if Idenied
to myself that others should be
kept away from me as much as
possible to preserve my racialpur.
ity and cultural identity; then, some-
how, those beliefs might be trans-
lated to the general society; that
racism might end.

Beyond confessing, l accuse my
sell of unmitigated philanthropy and
social Armlnlanisl‘n. i should be
burned, of course, but perhaps the
ducking-stool might provide a more
cogent lesson to those in danger of
repeating my errors,

But now, i proclaim to the world:
l am freel l have been saved! No
more shall 1 oppress my fellow
(though completely different) man
by forcing him to tolerate, or even
come into contact with, my pre»
vious, "artificial” heritage.

A single mystic phrase, whichl
should understand perfectly, had
anyone in my childhood compelled
me to master English syntax, has
cleared my mind oi the devils which
heretofore plagued me.

As penance, l recite the phrase»
in a plain chant based on a E “Bop”
--100 times each night before rea
tiring: “For the reasons which bla
acks are being exploited in the ‘outr
side world’ are reason enough for
the blacks here to preserve all
their sanity, being, and awareness
as much as possible.”

Speaker’s Views

labeling is not surprising inthe cons
text of his opening remarks inwhich
he made it clear that he had little
to say to “Europeans" and felt no
responsibility to make scholarly
or professional sense.

One might conclude, then, that Dr.
Wright was interested in conveying
only his attitude and posture to his
white audience, while perhaps saving
his expertise and professional in-
sights for private discussions within
the Black community

I have been concerned for some
time about the de lacio segregation
which pertains on the campus, and
with what i perceive to be the grow-
ing lack of sympathy for the consid—
eratiou of Black (or, if you prefer,
White) problems in the Grinnell Col—
lege community. l believethatnpnrt
of this apathy may result from rec
peated exposures to performances
like that or Dr, Wright. Many of us
could benefit a great deal from the
sharing of experience and insight
which Black professionals like Dr
Wright undoubtedly possess; such
sharing might help open lines of
communication between our two
communities.

To be intellectually insulted once
again because of the color of our
skins can only nrousc momentary
anger which quickly hocomcsn yawn

Alan T, Green

Eldridge. Grinnell

To the Editors:

When one considers Blackvwhite
relations at Grinnell there is reale
ly not much to say. because the
interaction between Blacks and Who
ites is minimal, As a Freshman I
dutifully attended all of the orienta-
tion seminars and discussions. Dur-
ing one such presentation, we were
told by Frank Thomas, a Black stue
dent leader, that We were all rac»
ists. lfl remember correctly, many
Blacks also attended that session.
What Frank Said is certainly true at
Grinnell; if you are not a racist
before you get to Grinnell, you are
at least forced into acting like one
while you attend school here.

AS every Grinnell student knows,
there is Virtually no communication
between the races, If you are White,
saying hello to a Black is just
not done, unless he is a very out
standing person. I have seen many
a friendly Black come to Grinnell
and, I suppose by peer group pres~
sure, at least act like a racist.
I remember a time last year when
I was standing in line for dinner
in back of two Black girls, Since
I happened to hear something rolee
vnni, l interiected a comment
One of the girls turned around and
said, “I don't think we have been

Kurz: Education Definition

To the Editors:

A basic problem of Grinnell Col-
lege, as l view it, is that we have
gone through many substantial soc-
ial changes, but academically we
have changed very little. These so»
cial changes have briefly satisfied
us, and have now disguised the ex.
isting academic crisis,

We always think in terms of cre—
dits and grades, departments and di-
visions, We have continually been
unit zed. Education, however, is a
flowing process, What 1 propose
is an investigation of alternative
forms of college education, perhaps
even a redefinition of a “college
education”. Academics at Grinnell
College must break from the past
and begin reorientation for the fu-
ture, (There are existing education-
al institutions that can be used as
a model.)

Do you feel guilty when you take
time off of “class work” for some
thing else? This must be changed.
There are many things besides “ole
ass work” that are significant to an
education, Why else do you come
to a college instead of spending
four years in a library? Academic

Race Relations

sure I would not have received this
snub, 1 call this bigotry,

l have talked to a number of Bla-
cks outside of Grinnell about this,
and they are yust as surprised
about this type of reaction as l am.
True, you must guard yourself aga—
inst rednecks if you are Black;
a few exist at Grinnell. But how do
Blacks expect to solve theproblems
of prejudice, hate, and injustice
by being vengent black separatists
themselves?

To the Editors:

Today, something happened which
shocked us. We took a straw sur
vey to determine how wellrinformed
Grinnell students are about foreign
policy,

We admit that our survey was to»
tally unscientific, haphazard, and
even slipshod We asked people
at random and our questions could
not possibly have fully tested some-
one’s knowledge of foreign policy.

However, the results are incredr
ible We asked these questions:

I. Who is the Secretary of State?

2. Who is the Secretary otDefeIlsc'.‘

3. Who is the President's National
Security Advisor?

pressure is another result of the
existing academic setup that must
be dealt With. Education Should not
be pressured to the extent of hate
red,

Academic excellence is often spr
oke of What good is academic
excellence Without academic per-
tinence? Let's redefine our goals.

Education seeks to adapt an in»
dividual to society, to a living st-
andard, to .an activity, We must
insist that courses include all in—
terpretations so that our education
does not become propaganda.

The EPC as it exists now has
very little power. This must be
challenged and changed

My view towards “leadership“ is
as follows: Take the ideas of the
students and concentrate them, then
go to the students, persevere in
the ideas and carry them through,
so as to form correct ideas of
leadership. This means to set up
better communications between the
EPC representative and others. How
many times do you feel you’ve
contributed to the EPC representar
tive's point of view?

Many times student representatir
ves consider faculty, administrati»
on, and trustee opinions equally to
those of the students, These other
factions represent their own point
of View. The result is that the
student opinion is never known and
never really considered. Student
representatives must express stu-
dent opinions. Firmly expressing
student opinion, which is sometimes
unpopular, is hard to do when the
opponent is a personal friend. “To
let things slide for the sake of pe-
ace and friendship when a person
has clearly gone wrong, and to rec
train from principled argument bee
cause he (sic) is an acquaintance
..,or to touch on the matter lightly
instead of going into it thoroughly,
so as to keep on good terms",
lieel, is very wrong

Mayor changes are long range goe
als. I feel the following short range
goals are necessary:

1) increased acceptance and em-

phasis on practicum, including pra

acticum in nonncademlc areas

(carpentry, auto mechanics. etc)

2) a new grading system. The pre—

sent one creates too muchpressure

for students. The reestablishnlent
oi. credit-fail would help. but is
not a final goal

3) less emphasis on n "final pl‘oo

duct" for independents and more

emphasis on what is learned and
accomplished,
