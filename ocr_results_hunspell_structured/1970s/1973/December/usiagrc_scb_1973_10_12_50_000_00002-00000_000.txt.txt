Agnew:

by Deirdre Smith

Reaction to Vice President Spiro
Agnew’s resignation ran the gamut
irom exuberance to deep regret,
according to a Scarlet and Black
poll taken about two hours aiter the
resignation was made public.

College students, in general,
seemed to be the most pleased and
the least hesitant in expressing the
eir opinions. As ireshinan Sandy
Monroe explained, “i love it. its
high time i wish Nixon would re~
Sign,”

Townspeople, however, were much
more reserved and hesitant in their
teelings about the resignation. Many
were willing to comment but would
not give their names,

One housewiie at McNally’s said
she was “quite surprised. lreally
had believed him all through the
whole thing. 1 thought that he was
probably more honest than Nixon.”

An elderly lady in McNally’S ielt
similar regret. ”I'm very disappe
ointed. I’m sorry ior the maul
thought he was a iine man...rm just
sorry because there is too many
others who have done the same
thing.” ‘

“The station has been receiving
a very heavy volume oi calls irom
listeners wanting the latest infore
motion. The same interest was
evident during the revolution in
Chile. As a local station, we are
able to provide iniormation overthe
air when requested. it the teletype

Reacﬁon

An agitated housewife, Mrs. H. B.
Barrett, also displayed unhappiness
and Iatalism. “I was kind OI a {an
oi his. I think it (the resignation)
was inevitable.”

Shaken iaith in either “the sys»
tem” or politicians was widesp-
read. One housewife said her con»
iidence in the government had de»
finitely been undercut and another
explained that, ”The system is all
right; its Just the man."

One person skeptically commented
that while, "it didn't really shake
my belief in the system, it cer»
tainly makes you wonder what will
happen next,"

The only energetic response irom
the people interviewed downtown
came from a young clerk in Mce
Nally's Who explained, “Its about
the best thing that’s happened since
they’ve been in oiiice. They‘reabout
the corruptest peoplel'veseenyet."

When asked it he would be glad
to see Nixon resign, he replied,
”You’re not kidding!"

The mood or the professors in-
terviewed was concerned and th-
oughtiul. Don Smith saw it as a
“real Victory for public morality
in the country when a Vice Pres»
ident so charged resigns. I‘m very
pleased. not in any vindictive way
against the Vioeepresident, who
seems to me to be, in many ways,

V" d
a more admirable person than the
President."

Bruce l-lalverson said, in regard
to Agnew’s resignation, “It seems
he must be guilty, and that's the
right thing to do,"

"I’m appalled at the state or Am»
erican politics at this point. l‘m
especially upset that its a Repub»
lican administration, As a mem-
her of the Republican Party, I th-
ink that we should do our utmost
to protect individual rights which
have been subverted throughout the
dirty tricks campaign.”

Ethnic Dances
Tomorrow

(0CR)--A dozen European and Mir
ddle Eastern nationalities will be
represented in the program when the
Grinnell College Folk Dancers perr
iorm in concert Saturday.

The concert, a highlight oi the
Parents’ and Alumni Day activi-
ties, is scheduled for ID p.m. in
Darby Gymnasium.

Senior Carolyn S. Ferry will dir-
ect a troupe oi some 40 students
in a program that includes dances
from Armenia, Bulgarian, Czecho-
slovakia, Finland, Hungary, lreland,
lsrael, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Scotland, and Turkey.

longhorn Issue to Commission

A boycott continued this week a-
gainst the Longhorn Restaurant
here, as participants in the contro-
versy worked to resolve their diff—
erences.

Darlene Pomerenk, a member of
the Grinnell Human Rights Commi-
ssion, said Wednesday that an ins
formal complaint had been illed a-

gainst the Longhorn by the Con»
cerned Black Student (CBS) through
the Grinnell Human Rights Commi-
ssion. /

She added that a closed meeting
between owner Tom Parmley, other
members of the Longhorn stall, and
representatives nt the Black

knapp

Finally, both parties have new
state chairmen. A word should be
added here that the parties oi lowa
are diiierent train the stereotype
oi the nation. Both are more lib-
eral than is generally thought, al-
though both have consecutive wings
oi about equal size. ideology on the
state level is sometimes more ime
portant than party tags, as the
recent split between the Ray wihg
oi the party and the conservatives

in the Senate illustrated. For the-

Democrats, Toni Whitney oi Des

students will be held at 4:40 pm.
Monday in an alien to mediate the
issue.

Parmley says a cook at the Long-
horn has already spoken to a Black
girl who she had evicted from the
establishment, and that this part
of the complaint had been settled.

He adds that he met intormally
with representatives of the Commi—
ssion Wednesday in what he des—
cribed as a,fact-Iinding session.

Sybille Scott, CBS spokesperson,
said Thursday night the boycott will
continue at least until the Monday
meeting.

Moines was recently elected ch-
airman. Ed Gilmour, first district
chairman, although he did not vote
ior Whitney, moved to make the
nomination unanimous.

All one can ask, then, in speaking
to a large out oi state contingency,
is do not rate lowa politics on the
basis or your home state. The elec—
tions in 1974 should be both close
and interesting. Most important,
they will be free of unfair or iller
gal pressures that are character—
istic, it seems, of so much at the
democr process.
