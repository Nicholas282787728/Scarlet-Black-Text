nded its unbeaten streak over

e Pioneers seemed toletup somer
hat and played lethargic ball for
a rest of the first half. A second
nox goal, scored by senior Dave
auman, gave Grinnell an uncome

‘rtable Z-goal halftime deficit.

the afternoon. Taking a “cross'
on his head, he sent the hall whist-
ling into the net,

Grinnell’s fourth and final tally
came when a hustling liorowitz sp»
lit two Knox fullbacks and angled
a loose ball goalwards just as the
Knox goalie was about to pick it
up. For Horowitz it was his third
score of the young season The 5-4
score remained through the few
minutes which followed, giving Knox
their opening day win and a 1-0
record,

Now holding an 0—2 wonrlost re—
cord, Grinnell must win every other
game for even a shot at the South-
ern Division title. Included in the
schedule are rematches with unde-
feated C09 and Knox. Coach Tom

Vanderhyden thinks the squad can‘

do It. “I say we can win the next
six,” he commented after the de-
feat. "And you can quote me on it,”
he added.

Vanderhyden‘s sooth—saying abil-
ities will be put to their first test
tomorrow at the Tenth Avenue Soc-
cer Field, as the Pioneers hostMon-
mouth. The Scots lost their opener
at Cornell, 3-2, but may have pro-
fited by the two week lay-off they
are coming off after their open-
date Saturday. Last year Grinnell
shut out the Scots 4-0 in the only
meeting of the two clubs. This year
they will play twice.

Game»time will be 1:30 p.m. and
the game will he played regardless
of weather conditions. ,

Women Drop Opener 3-0

by an sol; staff writer

The women's field hockey team
opened its season here last Sate
urday in a game with the Univer-
sity of Northern Iowa. Although
the squad lost the match 3-0, the
game was well—played.

Many of the players had never
participated in field hockey come
petition and it was the first time
this year that there had been two
full teams on Mac Field, since
there are not enough players on the
Grinnell team to have full scrlmr
mages.

Perhaps the fact that the Scarlet

and Black improved as the game
progressed is some indication of
how the season may go The grea-
test difficulty for the home team
was in trying to stop UNl’s free
hits and in getting its own free
hits past the UNI defense. The
game did see some fine work by
goalie Leanne Schwartz and soph-
omore wing Linda Peden. Hopefully
the team will be able to score this
week at Decorah, 12., when it takes
on Luther Despite an Oil won-lost
record, the team is encouraged by
its showing Saturday and looking
for a win.

Monmouth Coasts

by Dave Schechter and Tom Sherrell

It couldn't have been much worse,
but it was an improvement over last
year. The Monmouth Scots,defendr
ing Midwest Conference champs who
trounced Grinnell 6377 last year,
added insult to injury by whipping the
outnmanned Pioneers 50-0 last Satr
urday on ward Field.

The horror story is told in the
statistics, with Monmouth getting
492 yards in total offense to Grins
nails 73. On the ground Monmouth
had the edge 326-55, while inthe air
the margin was 166718,

Grinnell isn't to be totally faulted
for the one-sided score. Monmouth
is a school of different academic
composition and thus there is a (life
fernce in the size and quality of
the football squads. TheScots'hack-
field trio of Al Shepard, John Cars
ter, and Ron Baker ran for 260 yards
as Baker pounded out 123 himself,
In the air, Monmouth completed 9
of 21 passes as starting quarter-7
back Jim Rose clicked for 120 yards
on 5-for-IZ.

For Grinnell, freshman tailback
Mark Schultz gained 20 yards in 12
carries and caught two passes for
7 yards, Pioneer quarterback Paul
Delaney, alsoafreshman, passed for
4 completions on 12attempts. Grin—
nell had 4 first downs to Monmouth’s
26; however, it wasn’t all bad The

first half ended with Monmouth ahead
just 14.0. First-half TD’s were so-
ored by Baker on a run, and a 45.
yard pass play from Rose to Gary
Peevler.

Second-half touchdowns were scor-
ed on passes from Rose to Peevler
and Shepard, and on runs by Sher
pard, Carter (twice), and Gary Kins
ney (who scored on his first play
in the game). Monmouth also scorv
ed a safety and Smith converted
six of seven extra poinIs.

The pass coverage by Grinnell's
deep secondary was the one hright'
spot in the game, Defending against
passes were Jim Eriles, Jim rall—
acc, Walt Pearcey, Tom Goetz, Mike
Harris, Pete Friend, and Brian
cook,
es on the Monmouth squad caused
the outbreaks. Pearcey bore the
brunt of the cuts and also took some
physical abuse before losing his
poise and fighting back.

perhaps the besI Grinnell play of
the game irom the fan's point of
View was Wally Bowers’ attempt to
block an extra point. Bowers tookn
running yump onto the back of Mon-
month's center and flew on towards
the placevkicker. Unfortunately the
ball had not been snapped, All the
Scotts got out of it was another
chance and a center with a firmly
implanted footprint on his back.

Student-Athletes Sought

let that, “it has become more and
more difficult for a college like
Grinnell to have an adequate num
ber of scholarwthletes enrolled in
its program ..We must have a big
ger pool of applicants who have a
strong interest and ability in com-
petitive athletic ,This is where we
need your help. ince We are not
the kind of college that permits
no-holds-barred recruitment, we
must depend on our alumni and
other friends to help us get larger
numbers of prospects who can suc—
ceed at Grinnell both as students
and as athletes ”

The issue is the getting of those
qualified athletes, not the effort to
get them Dean Waldo Walker says,
”We want to offer a little more
competition than we are...The life
style of this particular student body

is such that it won’t make heroes 1

out of varsity athletes."Then what's
in it for the boy? Every adminiss
trator questioned commented, “The
opportunity to get an excellent edur
Cation ” Since the Midwest Confer
ence doesn’t permit the giving of
athletic scholarships, the education
has to be the prime motivating fac-
tor for any student to come toGrin-
nell .

Nicholas Ryan, the head of admiss
sions commented, “Thepresent Stu-
dent body and the programs offered
are factors which influence a stu-
dent selecting a college.” Ryan who
holds theslngle gamerushing record
for Grinnell football, continued, “We
attempt to accurately present the
College Io prospective students. I
think that it is safe to say that the
current status of the athletic pro-
gram is a factor to a prospective
student who is interested in parti—
cipating in intercollegiate athle-
tiCS, .It is more difficult to attract
a football player or a wrestler to
a college when that college‘s pro
grain is not currently as success-
ful as others,,,wc are not going to
lower our standards in an effort
to compete with other schools."

in a similar light Jim Avison of
the office of development expressed
a thought that is becoming increase
ingly prevalent across the country,
“We’re more concerned whether
or not the boy becomes a doctor
or a lawyer rather than if he plays
for the Vikings...Universities like
the professionals are in the enter-
tainment business. It’s a wholediff—
erent ball game. whatever number
of young men who want to play
have the opportunity to do so (at
Grinnell)" Bully for Jim Avison;

lHE SIDELI N ES

it’s about time that college and
university administrators woke up
and realized that in athletics more
emphasis should he placed on the
participation aspect than on the
winning aspect. This will be dis-
cussed next week in the column on
philosophy of sport.

It’s a good thing that the Midwest
Conference doesn’t permit recruit-
ing (well almost all schools in it
don’t solicit athletes). This confer-
ence has been acting contrary to
NCAA for years, and doing it for
the good of the boys participating
in the intercollegiate sports pro,
gram. Dean Ryan noted, ”There
are a couple of schools in this cons
ference which do not fully abide
by the regulations which are for
them as well as the other schools.
The Violations come in the sense
of recruitment and in the sense
of financial aid."

As the athletic director and a
coach John Pfitsch has built up
many close acquaintences over the
years and he is not putting these
to work for him. Grinnell used to
have a program of not outright
recruiting, but of not discouraging
looking for prospective student athr
letes As a matter of issue I whole
heartedly agree with John Pfitsch’s
letter and with the attitude of the
school's administrators in regard
to the policy of looking for and
identifying student athletes.
