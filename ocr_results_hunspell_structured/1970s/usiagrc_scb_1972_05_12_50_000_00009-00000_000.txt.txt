Career Services To Expand

The Career Services Office, which
has received some criticism in re
cent months, will undergoa revamp
ing next year according to Mrs
Marjory Daly Asst, bean oiStudeiits
Affairs The most noticeable addi-
tion will he the Career Guidance
program. which has been made pos
sible by assistance from Philip
Brown, a Gi'inneII graduate who is
new President of Interstate As-
sui-ance Company, Des Moines

The main locus ot the new program
will be to ill ing leaders of the buss
mess community onto the campus to
discuss their work with students,
answering questions not only about
What their jobs entail but also how
careers in various sectors of the
business world will affect life styles
Working with Mr. Brown in
developing the program have been

Propose Black
Studies Major

The Ad Hoc Committee on Black
Studies has given its support to the
creation of a Black Studies Il'tajﬂl”
This move came after almost a semr
ester of consideration

The maior would consist ola mini—
mum ol so credits. Four core
courses will be required itthe major
is approved: English 2xx, a new
introduction to AfrOrAmcrican lit-
erature; two new History 2xx
courses. AfrosAmerican History I
and II; and Black Studies 496, the
senior seminar. Sixteen additional
credits would be taken from either
English or one of the social science
disciplines: Anthropology, Econ
noniics, Political Science, Socwlogy,
or History

A student major would take four
additional courses from a specified
list of relevant social science and
English courses (from departments
other than the one he takes sin
teen credits in) to complete the
major.

Thus while the program is inter,
disciplinary in character. it also
includes a concentration in a tradir
tional discipline or department. The
committee feel as that this feature
will allow students to bring dlSr
ciplinary perspectives to the Senior
Seminar as well as allow for some
in depth study in a particular field
The major will be administered by
a committee of iacutty teaching in
the program with the aid oia stu-
dent educational policy committee.
The Dean of the College will ap-
point tlie chairman. Members of the
faculty committee will have re
sponsibility tor the stalling and the
evaluation of the program in consulr
tation witli students and iaculty pare
ticiputing in the program.

The committee, in a statement on
the program, said that the estabr
lishment or a major program in
Black Studies is a legitimate and ap-
propriate educational policy, The
proposal recognizes that the history,
the culture, and the particular prob—
lems of 25 million blacks, like other
programs, demands attention by
institutions 0t higher education, 3L
tention that has traditionally not been
given.

However, the Black Studies Com-
mittee's proposal must be approved

Charges that CBS charged ior guest
tickets to the Emotions Revue cone
cert are apparently true, but accord,
ing to Dean of Students Conney
KiITibo no Grinnell students were
actually charged tor tickets or
denied seats at the event.

The St“? has been able to mourn
struct most of the events leading
up to the concert. About a week
before the concert, the Social
Coordinating Committee of CBS
mailed letters announcing the con-
cert io groups at several area colv
leges. The letters indicated that
there would be an admission charge
of $1.50 per person for noneGrinnell
students.

Mr. Kimho became aware of the
letters during a Friday meeting of
the Black Student Coordinating Come
mittee, but was under theimpres.
sion that the event in question was
to be held during Black Martyrs
Weekend, fifteen days later.

Thus, no formal action had been
taken by the time or the concert,
and some tickets were sold both in
advance and at the door to none
Grinnell Students. The proceeds
irom these sales, according to
Kimho, went to pay [or a party
held following the Emotions’ second
performance.

Kimho pomted out that, because of
the variety of Grinnell activities,
many ilonrstudents are on the cam~
pus during special weekends,
“Freeloadilig” and party crashing
often occur among these noanrinr
nellians, he said, and the charge
(or guest tickets. which was [ore
mally described as a donation ior
the party, may have been an attempt
to cut down on stich “irceloautng”

CBS Kotnko Spokesman Lawrence

otticial college action prior to the

concert was limited to a firm states

or this kind. .

Mr Kimho indicated that no further
disciplinary action against CBS was
anticipated from this infraction He
emphasized that the most important
thing was to make certain that such
incidents could not occur again

“The CBS leadership was explicitly
told that it is not to happen again,”
Kimbo noted. He felt that the ins
cident was the result of ii l'l'llSr
understanding, and that he doubted
similar incidents would occur in the
future.

The present first district repre—

vinsk . “I was against the war
years ago. But who takes the stand
when it may not he popular? That
is the k ill of leader this district
deserves," Schwengcl supports the
Nixon economic plan, wliicllaccordr

mentions boost to big business, It
hasn’t filtered down to the consti-
nicrs " Schwengel also iuvors Sc»
crctary of Agriculture Earl Butz,
who, Mczvmsky observes, "has
a philosophy of adapt or die." In
education, as well, Scliwengel has
taken a stand with which Mezvlne
sky disagrees: he did not vote loi-
IIEW appropriations tothe country's
schools.

”He has been better thaii some,"
Mczvmsky admits or his oppc»
nent, "bill he has defended the
adliiiilistratioti's policies.” Alr
though the candidate does not say it,
the glare it! his eye indicates that
this iact, more than any other, may
lie the difference between he and
his incumbent opponent Mezvinr
sky, obviously enough, does not
support the administration‘s p0»
licies.

The new tirst district of Iowa, with
Benton and Poweshiek counties
added, has three strong classes of
voters to which Mezvinsky hopes
to appeal the farmers, the county's
senior citizens, and the city people,

The rural people of Iowa, for eXr
ample. "have not been given a good
parity of income.” Mezvinsky far
vors iartn price support systems,
and government assistance for “i'u-
ral development programs "

Senior citizcns have "largely been

says, "and”lct's fuceitntheolder

claims, "is a right “ His ringer

“in many Cases people's lifetime
savings may be wiped out because
or unexpected medical expenses.
And their sons and daughters end
up paying for it." in taxes, as well,
the aged find themselves being dis-
criminated against, because of tax
increases which cut the spending
power of people on fixed incomes
Mezvinsky favors better Social
Security beneiits and an old-age
assistance program On these
bases he hopes to attract the votes
of the older first district voters

AS far as the cities are Concerned,
Mezvinsky sees that with employ

and pay 10% oi the taxes ‘1 Mez»
vinsky supports the Tax Reporm Act
of 1972, which would close tax
loopholes tor the rich and “bring
into Iowa $219 million a year."

The major statewide issue which
concerns Mezvlnsky is the instir
tution of adult rights for ill-yearn
oltls The Iowa legislature has voted
adult rights for those 19 years old.
“The legislature has playcn the
numbers game. If a person could
be mayor of Grinneli he should have
ndult rights and responsibilities,”
A large part or the state's poli-
tical problems, Mezvinsky claims,
is that special interests tlave a
tremendous amount of power at the
state level. State legislators have
iew people working ior them, and are
able to do very little research iiito
the questions addressed by current
legislation. Thereiore a great deal
of the information state legislators
obtain is given them by the lobbyr
ists, who present their own point
of View about the situation.

“I favor lobbyist disclosure How
many are being paid, and how much
are their salaries? Some make
over $100 thousand a year.” IS—
PIRG, Mezvinsky notes. can be part
of the answer. “This group can
counter the other side state gun
vei'itment needs this kind of help.”

Mezvlnsky strongly urges the
young college voters of lowa to cast
their votes in the next election,
“whether they cast them here or
not, But here in Iowa they should
remember that their votes can make
a big difference."

Ed Meavmsky is resting his hopes
on the votes of thel farmers, the
senior citizens, the city dwellers,
and the young. l-lis maior concern
is for the citizen who can use as—
sistance from his government. “The
forces for human needs in this
country have been warped by air
tention to binding programs [or

focus on our people’s needs The
threat from within this country is
greater than that trom without Cone

On to central campus, off to see
