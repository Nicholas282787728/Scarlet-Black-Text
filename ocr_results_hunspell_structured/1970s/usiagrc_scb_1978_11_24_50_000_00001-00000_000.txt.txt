Sabbatical leaves
create faculty gaps

by John Mandel

The recent Concern ol Russmn
students over next year's depart-
mental understalﬁng will get them
nowhere. according to Dean Waldo
Walker

Decisions to ill! or not to llll
positions created by leaves are
made by Walker min advice from
the Executive Council, in ace
cordaiice with a policy created
several years ago,

COST CONSIDERATIONS are
the underlying reasons lor the
policy which limits the number of
taculty positions. The limit is set at
103 lullrtime positions with hall~
and quarter-time positions
bringing the total up to around 107.

A problem arises when a
professor goes on a sabbatical
leave, because the college still has
to pay hall oi his or her salary.
Thus, while keeping the total
number of positions within limit,
only a certain number of positions
created by leaves can be filled.
.WllEN DECIDING which
positions to fill, Walker says he and
the Council consider the question:
“Will not filling the position cause
the department's program
irreparable damage?" Then,
acting on the Council’s suggestion.
Walker makes the decision, He
stresses that in the case of the
Russian department, the decision
has already been made.

The Russian department is a
somewhat typical example of the
problems the policy causes a small
department. No one will be hired to
take the place oi- department]
chairman John Mohan. who will be

 

on a one year sabbatical. Because
of this, five popular literature
courses (which are taught in
English) will not be taught next
year, The courses Will be offered
again in the 1980-81 school year,
when Mohan returns,

THE COURSES are aimed
primarily at nonrmajors, though
majors also take them. Mohan
stresses that the department's core
courses will still be altered. as will
the Russian language courses. He
sees no problems in tile depart-
ments ability to meet major
requirements.

Assistant prolessor Dick Steele'

points out that he and instructor
Sheila McCarthy will have to do
extra work. handling both ad-
ministrative chores and their
current duties.

BOTH MOHAN and Steele stress

that Russian majors and potential '

majors will have to plan their
courses quite carefully, Walker
adds that the situation is “a little
tighter than it has been, but it’s not
going to destroy the program."
Senior Russian major Paula
Banchy points out that not filling a
position “especially affects a small
department like ours,” She says an
additional problem is created
because in ioreign language
departments it is important to
have a one-tarone relationship
between student and instructor.
Next year Russian teachers will
probably be quite pressed for time.
But Russian students won't be
alone. Out of ten faculty positions
that will be open at Grinnell, only
two or possibly three will be filled,‘

Higher bank rates
confront students

by Eric Berry

Grinnell students are disturbed
at the soonrtosbe-instituted
checking account lee hike at the
Poweshiek County National Bank.

According to John Wemer, a
bank ofﬁcer, the bank does not
wish to discourage student clients,

The bank‘s increased lees. which
will go into ellect in January, are

‘ intended to cover the cost of the

checking service.

The monthly charges oi to [are

balance between $200 and 8300, and
$2 [or an account of $300 to $500
plus, will hit students, who usually
do not have large accounts, the
hardest, However. Werner claims
that the bank does not desire to lose
its student customeis.

“We have had ten or so come in
from the college who were quite
upset. They were satisﬁed alter we
explamed the policy was to cover
"osts." says Wemer,

Werner claims that banks all
over the country are beginning to

lcnmpares the Poweshiek Bank’s
fees to a Des Moines bank that
charges 16 cents on each check
written on an account.

Checking at the Grinnell State

its fee is so cents per month ior
accounts of less than $200 and eight
