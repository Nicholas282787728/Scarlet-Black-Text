Women’s studies

zEach Volunteer staffer sub»
mitted a proposal of what she

inuld like to teach to her fellow
taff and student committee
members. Where gaps in a come
prehensive study of women ap-
peared, mate iaculty members
were asked to lecture. Literature.
history, music, art, dance,
education, and economics were
designated as lecture and
discussion topics, All activities
were to center around two general
ourse themes how women are

‘ Lreated in societal Institutions and
the developing sell-consciousness
of Women,
‘ Preiss, McCarthy, and Michelle

‘aseyr as student organizers of the
course, pushed ior scheduling one
discussion for every lecture held.
They aimed ior integration oi
'olitics and many other Con~
truversial, feminist issues,
originally hoping the ad
ministration would approve a pass-
tail grading system for the course.
in addition, they hoped the courr
se’s emphasis would be placed
upon “projects" rather than
papers,

The Course didn't turn out
exactly as student organizers had
planned, Although some projects
and class presentations were done,
most students opted ior the
traditional paper which Preiss,
» cCarthy, and Casey had hoped to
«void. Three such were required,
while no tests were given. Faculty
planners, apparently pressured by
the response of the rest or the

ﬁrinnell iaculty to make the course
ore “academic," opposed an
overly controversial stance in
lectures and discussions They also
pressed tor dropping the idea oi a
passJail, feeling that the ad
ministration would not consider it
to be “academically viable” at
Grinnell.

Approximately 65 students [are
registered for the course, of whom
four were men The enrollment

was much too large, according to
several oi the iaculty members,
ﬁthough Jean McCarthy em-
phasized that unrestricted
enrollment was necessary to
Sﬁshow the need for women's
[studies at Grinnell,"

Must enrollees appear to have
been social science majors who
had not participated in campus
women’s activitics previously.
However, as Susan Bolduc stated,
the “people really behind the
course are in or are interested in
the women's group." Although last
fall’s planning sessions were'open,

she believes that the planners
didn‘t receive enough outside
views, This circumstance may
have contributed to many
discussions being carried on irom
a “strictly feminist point oi view,”
a result commented upon by
Bolduc.

Possibly because of the large
enrollment and irequent turnover
from lecture to lecture of the staff,
attendance at the group lectures
and especially at many of the
original small group discussions
was poor. Brenner stated that
originally the course was to be a
joint venture between the
professors and the students.
Though stressing excellent pet»
formances on the part of ten or
iiiteen people in the class, Brenner
said she was disappointed about
the general lack oi involvement on
the part oi class participants.

Students and faculty alike state
that the course basically only
scanned the surface oi the topics
concerning women. Cohesiveness
between the differently oriented
lectures remained a major
problem However, since the in»
volVed women realize that the
course was by nature highly ex-
perimental (in number of teachers,
range oi study. and planning by
Staffrsludent committee) even
women who have spcciiic com~
plaints about the course seem to
agree that the lessons learned in
planning and carrying out this
Course will benetit in im-
plementing iuture women's studies
courses, Alter participating in the
present “Women’s Studies,"
Professor McCarthy believes that
a Similar class,“would have
worked very well in a seminar-type
situation with some twentyetive
students ” Associate Professor of
History and American Studies
Marilyn Leonard stated, “I think
it's very important that the matter
be included in regular courses.
There is also a place for Women's
studies as separate course
listings,"

Now, nearly one semester alter
“Women‘s Studies” began,

 

although some spccitic opinions
held by those women involved in
the course have changed, a deiinite
need for some form of women's
studies at Grinnell continues to be
felt, Although Dean of tile
Curriculum Mary Eysenbach, one
of the nine faculty members who
team-teaches the course, does not
foresee an immediate future for a
women’s studies program. she
expects a continuation oi the trend
for individual departments to
gradually add courses with special
emphasis on women,

When asked what She thought of
a women's studies major program,
Eysenbach stated that a high
degree oi competence in a par
ticular discipline is preferable to
interdisciplinary competence. She
added that primary emphasis
should lie with majors stressing
specific disciplines,

Eysenbach sees a particular
need tor a strong emphasis on
women in history and literature.
She believes that it is important to
study women in such areas as
literature just as one would study
authors at different nationalities

different. from those of men, as
well as how women are treated in
literature),

Next semester the trend toward
interdisciplinary Women's study
will be strengthened by a new
course niicring in the history
department New history iaculty
mcmbcr Mary Gibson will offer
special topics course “European
and American Women, 1359-
present.” Gibson. who has taught. a
similar course at another school,
was hired with her interest in the
women's history area in mind. The
course is listed as a “pecial topics

usually lasting only one or two
semesters, However, Professor of
History Philip L Kintner stated
that it will be a “regular part oi
Mary's teaching repertoire.” He

added that he expects to see the’

course change from a special
topics to a regularly otiered course
very soon

enthusiastic" about hiring
someone like Gibson who could

Gibson's course most likely will
be much more oi a “demographic
and social history” than a ieminist,
political or institutional history.
Kintner believes that the course's
comparison or American and
European women will be a
chronicle oi the masses rather than
an elitist history.
