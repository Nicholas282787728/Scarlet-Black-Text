Cross Country Team
Opens Season Today

Chuck McGrath has nailed
down the number one spot,
but all other positions on the
Grinnell College cross coun-
try team remain up for grabs
as the Pioneers prepare for
the inaugural meet of the sea
son.

Coach Ray Obermiller’s our
ﬁt will open the campaign
Friday (Sept. 10) by hosting
Coe, Simpson, and Faith Bap-
tist Bible College. The three-
mile meet, set for 4 p.m.,
will begin and close on Mac-
Eachron Field and will be
scored on a dual meet basis.
McGrath has led the Pioneers
to a 1271 dual meet cross
country record the last two
years. Other cross country—
track veterans on the roster
are Phil Morales, Jon Stein,
and Scott Weil.

Obermiller is without four-
fifths of last fall’s top five
--Eric Jahn, John Russell,
Phil Frank, and Oscar Ralf
benborg -- but his freshman
contingent may be the best in
several years.

hand off technique.

Grinnell Football Team lacks Depth This Yea

by Lee

Hiya fansl Football season is
fast approaching, impossible
as it may seem, with the first
game being played September
18 against Monmouth College
here.

Yesterday I paid a visit to
Darby Gym and football coach
Edd Bowers. We talked about
a [or of different things, all
of which were related to foot
ball.

One of the first things which
came up was how the prac*
tices were going. Coach 80‘
wers said that the rules of
the Midwest FoOtball Confer
rence allowed only 20 prac-
tices prior to the first game,
so that he was concentrating
primarily on teachingand cone
ditioning the players.

The first scrimmage was
played earlier this week and
Coach Bowers feels that the
team has a lot of patential.
So far there have only been
two injuries, notably tackle
Bill Wright who is out with
a shoulder injury and Scott
Stewart, full and halfback who
is suffering from an undisr
closed ailment.

Probably the one question
which many football fans have
been asking themselves is why
Barry Huff won‘t be playing.
Well, have I got a surprise
for you! Barry will be playing
this season in a limited ca
pacity as a kicker.

The reason why there was
so much confusion over whe-
ther Barry would be playing
was because of a knee injury
which he suffered from last
season.

The physical education complex looms in the background as Grinnell players look for the foOtball

duringa recent practice session.

Coach Bowers stressed that
Barry would be freeto become
more involved in the game if
he felt up to doing so. When
asked about how the new pla-
yers arc shaping up, Coach
Bowers told me that thereare
a lot of good new players that
will really help the varsity
team, specifically Don Cham-
berlin, Don Bognanno, john
Potts and George Elakesley.
The Pioneers will have eigh-
teen returning lettermen: Wa-
shington Alston, Marion Bogn
nanno, Jeff Dick, Bill Dicks,
Steve Done, Dave Gitlin, Rod
Gleysteen, Jon Gray, Barry
Hiff, Ed Hirsch, Drake Hollie
day, Mike Levy Jim Pirolli,

Randy Sarver, Jared Van Wa-
genen and last but not least,
Bill Wright.

The [Cam this year will be
fielding 32 players, which is
about half as many players as
are fielded by St. Olaf Col-
lege, which has dominated the
midwestern football scene for
the past few years.

Other porential rivals are
Monmouth College, whom we
play our first game against
September 18 and Ripon Col*
lege, whom we play October
lo. Coach Bowers told me
that the only thing which is
hard abouthavinga small team
like the Pioneers is that one
injury can really cause trolr

' Everything You’ve Wanted To Know About Cross Country

by Nancy Wilson

Have you ever wondered what
Cross Country is?

Cross Country is long disr
mnce running over Varied tern
rain. All of the team’s run-
ners run the same course at
the same time. Most Cross
Country races average four
miles over pretty much level
ground. However practice
runs range from six to twelve
miIES.

Every night the workout is
different. It covers varied
terrain and seeks the two
primary objectives, endu~
rance and speed, in a variety
of ways. Five minutes per
mile for four consecutive
miles is excellent time. Four
miles in twenty four minutes

The Scarlet and Black

is also very good.

According to Cross Country
coach, Mrl Oberm'tllei', there
is more enjoyment to be found
in Cross Country than in track.
Runners lose their sense of
time and distance and often
acquire a sense of freedom.

A tremendous amount ofstan
mine is required, more than in
any other sport, Mr. Ober»
miller believes. For one thing,
there areno substitutions.Ml‘.
Obermiller believes that
Cross Country would be a
more exciting spectator sport
if spectators took their focus
off the winner and watched
all the runners. The lastguy’s
race is just as important on
his level ofability. Each run-
ner is challenging himself.
There is no superstar.

Perhaps these facts COI‘llri‘
bute to the considerable
amount of group respect which
Mr. Obermiller has Observed
in eighteen years of coaching
the sport.

YOUR TR \VEL HEADQUARTERS

The benefits of cross counn
try running: physical condi-
tioning and mental well being
override the discomforts for
this seasons 16 members. Of
the 16, six are seniors, eight
are freshmen, two are sophor
mores With no contribution
from the Junior class. Any
minor injury like a blister can
be painful in cross country
running. The runners challr
enge their bodies to the ut»
most. Naturally, any weak
spots show up. Unfortunately
the two best runners are OUI
with knee problems.

Daily practice in Cross
Country is essentiall Mr.
Obermiller compares condin
tioning to a sunrlan; a couple
weeks away and it begins to
fade, Mr. Obermiller feels
that the Cross Country run-
ners are a mature and very
dedicated group ofpeople. The
Cross Country season has be
gun and will end in mid N07
vember.

ble for the rest of the team,
especially if it's in a crir
timl position.

Another thing which Coach
Bowers pointed out was that
Grinnell offers no athletic
scholarships and that the plan
yers are awarded their grants
on the same basis as the non»
athletes.

In addition to the previously
mentioned players, the {0110*
wing people are also seen out
on the field; Don Aldrich, Eob
Donelan, Rick Faust, Tom
Kalhorn, John Onstad, John
Pursell, Mike Rosenfeld, Bill
Warren, Noble YoungandJer-
ry Zwecker.

As a final question, [asked
Coach Bowers how he felt
football was accepted by the
Other students on campus. He
feels that the students have
accepted it as a fun sport and
are really enthusiasticin their
support of our team. This I
think should be taken as a
compliment, both to the stu-
dent body and the football
team.

Well fans, I’ll be writing
again next week on anOther
facet of football.
