Meer-coor’musical triumvimte

Since 1975, Ken Goldsmith, John Jensen and Terry King
have been at Grinnell as “artists-in-residence.” A nice
sounding title—but the Mirecourt Trio members are more
than sequestered artists perfecting their repertoire.
Goldsmith, Jensen and King are active members of Grin»
nell’s teaching facultyl

But to many students, the Trio is still somewhat of a
mystery. To those who have avoided the Fine Arts
Building, the Trio is merely a group that gives several for-
mal concerts during the school year, a couple informal con-
certs in the dorms, and is bragged about in the school
catalog ,

This week, our cover focus lets the reader meet the Trio
members. You’ll find out who the members are, why
they‘re at Grinnell, and what others in the world of music
think of their work.

When you’re through reading the articles, Ken
Goldsmith, John Jensen and Terry King—the Mirecourt
Trio—will be much more than names used to make the col-
lege seem impressive.
