‘ Davidson Exhibit At Gallery mb‘émmnb'mm

by Ken Winokui'

East Street Gallery (723 State St)
is now exhibiting a collection ofphor
tographs by American photographer
Bruce Davidson. The exhibit, enti-
tled East loath Street is an attempt
to document the people of one city
block in Spanish Harlem,

East 100th Street consists mainly
at inlormal portraits of the people
in one of the most impoverished
areas of the nations biggest ghetto,
Davidson tried to portray the peo—
ple as they were, in the natural
surroundings and with natural pop
ses, and to direct as little as poss-
ible, By spending large amounts of
time on the block and by distribu~
ting literally thousands of photor
graphs he took, Davidson gained the
trust and good will of the residents.
This trust comes across in the phOr
tographs and distinguished them ire
om other, similar eflorts by other
photographers,

The naturallsm of the shots is in-
hanced by the tremendous impact
of Davidson’s photography, A one
time art student, Davidson is able
to control the medium and is able
to shape the picture to add expres-

Avison, Development Office

( by Steve Nunn

James Avison sits in his office
on the third floor of the Downtown
Olfice Building and watches thedolr
lars come in.

He is probably as responsible as
anyone person lor bringing those dc-
llars to the college. As vice-pres-
ident for development and resource
planning, Avison oversees fund or-
ives among alumni, townspeople and
others and proposals for foundation
grants that bring in much ofthe col-
lege‘s operating capital,

Alumni, tor example, gave the col-
lege almost $2 million last year,
and foundations contributed about
$250,000.

Currently Avison is attempting to

get additinal grant tunding tor the ,
new

teamtaughthumanities project,
in' iated by Peter Connelly, which
will begin next spring.

He and Dean Waldo Walker Vis-
ited Washington, D. (3.. recently
to present the project to the Na-
tional Endowment for the Human-
ites.

While there has been no word yet
from them, Avison remains hopeful
and says that enough iunding has been
secured irom another source to get
the project underway.

"Good Idea”

”The Connelly idea was something
we had been looking {Dru i’ve been
waiting about four years tor a real-
ly good idea in the humanities,"
Avison said.

The trick in- getting foundation
money, according to Avison, is gear-
ing your proposal to their expecta-
tions.

For a sophisticated foundation like

slon and interest.
The exhihit originally opened in
New York‘s Museum oi Modern
Art in 1971 and was immediately
recognized as one oi the major
photographic eiiorts ot the time.
Simultanious to the opening, a book
or the pictures, also entitled East

Ford or Rockeieller, you have to be
a lot more careful," he says. “They
have Ph.D.’sthere whoknowas much
about your subjectas you do. More.”

On the other hand, some corpora—
tions put their grant money in the
hands of public relations men. While
Avison doesn’t say that these are
an easier mark, he doesn't say they
aren’t,

But Allison stressed that the collr
ege does not go to ioundations in a
mercenary spirit.

“Most of these projects getiimited
grants. We have to be ready to carry
the operating costs alter the initial
starting grant expires."

Alumni Drive

in addition to scaring up foundation
money, Avison oversees the routine
iunderaising eitorts- that go on all
the time among alumni, parents, and
others.

One such effort is the annual town
fund raiser, whichnetted $36,000for
the college and a tree student conv
cert tor the donors this year.

Another is the drive for alumni
donations, which goes on all the
time and hit a new high this year

The alumni drive is being given
an extra impetus this year by an
anonymous alumnus who has pled—
ged to match 32 for $1, any gilt
train a graduate who did not give
last year or any increase over last
year train a graduate who did.

Class of 1905

Older classes tend to be moregen-
erous, in terms or percentage ol
members who give, than the more
recent.

Ranking number one tor last year
was the Class 0(1905, with 6 out of
