Youngbetg: Blasts tower Admission Standards

To the Editors,

Grinnell is facing the prospect
of fewer applications in the near
future, In the sixties, standards
were lowered to meet a similar
drop in applicants. The dropping
or standards is increasingly going
to pit Grinnell against the large
state schools in the struggle tor
students, Grinnell can’t Win in this
struggle because its tuition is so
much higher and because lower cal—
ibre students can’tutilizeGrinnell’s
unique academic environment as
successfully as higher calibre stu-
dents.

The expensive teacher-student ra-
tio here at Grinnell is a luxury
which only a traction of the stun
dents of the United States are will-
ing or able to pay tor. This expen-
sive teacher-student ratio at Grin-
nell now attracts increasing num—

bers oi lower calibre students who
have only a marginal hope oigett-
ing into graduate schools, And yet,
the ambition to get into graduate
schools runs high at Grinnell. For
a student who is ambitious academi-
cally Grinheli is a stepping stone
but an expensive one. Likewise, lo-
wer calibre students who desireohly
a liberal arts education v with no
lurther ambitions .. are paying hea-
vily for an experience that they are
not optimally equipped to beneiit
from, Students of the calibre found
at Grinnell are increasingly turn-
ing to large state institutions as the
most eiiicient educational institUr
tion {or students at their abilities.
Grinnell cannot compete with both
and at the same time schools like
Oberlin and like the University Of
Michigan. it cannot successiully
compete in two separate markets.
Even ii Grinnell were taken over

laws based in economics. In 2 mar—

not tap the expanding base of sup

a break” and urgingthelawmakers
to help her in repealing the tax
on “th vital necessities.”

In her letter, the 36thDistrictSenr

a lower rate,
