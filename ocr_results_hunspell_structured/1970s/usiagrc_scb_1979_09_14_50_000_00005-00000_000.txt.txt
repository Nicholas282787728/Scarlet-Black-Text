Drake on calendar, shake-up

President George Drake announced
at the SGA meeting last Wednesday
night that there will be no change in
the length of winter break this year.

Drake explained that the considered
changeAadding two weeks to winter
break, dropping a week irom spring
break. and moving classes and
graduation back a week—was rejected
because it would not help the college
conserve much energy in the long run,

If spring break had been shortened
to only one week, the college would be
obligated to keep the dorms open, as it
does during [all break. Since dorms
usually remain closed during spring
break, the proposed change would
have added an additional week during
which the college must operate at virr
tually full energy ciiicicncy. The
overall percentage oi energy that
would be saved was considered too
negligible to warrant any change in
the calendar, Drake explained.

He did point out, however, that the
length of next year's winter break was
still under consideration.

Drake also appeared beiore the
Joint Board to answer student qucs~
tions about the recent administrative
shake-up. The reorganization altered
Waldo Walker’s position as Dean of
the College and Provost to a position
which combines the provost and vice
provost duties. A new position, Dean
of the Faculty, will absorb Walker’s
curricular duties, as well as many of
those now performed by Assistant
Dean Roger Koester.

The changes, effective July 1, 1980,
have eliminated both Koester‘s posi-
tion and that of Vicefrovost Ken

Browning.

Drake told the SGA gathering that
he had decided reorganization was

ed that when he ﬁrst decided a
reorganization was necessary, he did
not consider the complete eftects of

ministrators would lose their jobs, and
that students would be displeased and

was unfortunate but necessary to best

Scarleteers and Tanagers regroup

by Bob Kim

“Hey, are you going to the s at T
concert tonight?”

“The s s B is giving a concert?”

Even though the Scarleteers and
Tanagers have been perIorming on
campus {or 15 years, little is known
about the ensemble.

The Scarleteers was a vocal octet
which formed as a splinter group from
the Men’s Glee Club in the 19405. They
even released an album in 1966.

The Tanagers, who were originally
called the Debonairs, formed as a
splinter group from the Women's Glee
Club in 1952. The name “Tanager" is
derived from the bird called the
Scarlet Tanager, that, ironically. can-
not sing a note.

Both groups existed separately,
singing mainly glee club and madrigal
selections, until a merger was
necessary in the midrlgﬁos because of
declining interest. The program at the

September 74, 1979

group slowly changed irom madrigal
to folk music during the 19605, with
the introduction of instilrments into
the group,

Since the college has no ofﬁcial at
iiliation with the group, responsibility
at re»establishing the ensemble falls
upon two or three members irom the
previous year. The s h r is comprised
oi ten musicians chosen through audi-
tions at the beginning of each
semester.

According to this year’s coors
dinators, Marcia Glick and Peter
Young, ”The S 81 T has modernized
and currently plays music which could
be loosely described as FM rock." In
addition to playing pieces by such
groups as Steely Dan, James Taylor.
and other pop groups. the group also
incorporates original material into
their periormances.

Each year, the s s 'r goes on a cori-

cert tour during spring break. The
group has played to high schools and
alumni groups throughout the Midwest
during these tours in past years,
Young pointed out that the tours are
jointly sponosred by the Office oi Col-
lege Relations and the Oliice of Ad-
missions, since “the S 8: T can be an
excellent PR device."

This year, the group is planning a
tall and spring concert, as well as
their annual tour. “I hope that the 5 dz
T will be able to perform at a few nur-
sing homcs, Skip Day, and a couple of
campus parties as we did Inst year,"
Glick commented

Interest in the S 5! T appears strung;

the openings this year.

“We were very pleased with the turn
nout and should have an excellent
group this year with all the new
talent," stalled Young. 5
