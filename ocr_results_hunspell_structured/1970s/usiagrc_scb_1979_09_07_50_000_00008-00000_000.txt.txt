‘ 99 Bicycle tours along pastoral

All of us have heard oi the Tour de
France, the Milaanan Remo Classic,
the Giro d’Italia, he Tour de l'Est.
But how many are familiar with the
Giro de Gilman or the Tour de
Kellogg?

Our city of Grinnell is the epicenter
of a network of cycling routes travers-
ed by some of the greatest racing
names in history— Jacques LePell,
Todd von TotJGuillermo diStrange, to

The same roads on which me
Searsburo Classique and Tour de
Malcom are run also provide a ,
multitude of routes for touring, day
riding, and any other kind of cycling
pleasure. The most famous routes, of
course, are the 20-25-mile round trips
which the racers have made il—
lustrious and which I will discuss
here, along with some longer exten-
sions.

name a few. Every year these giants
of the sport test their speed, en»
durance, and machines against each
other and the rolling country roads of
Iowa, traveling to towns whose names
may be only vaguely familiar to most
students, though enshrined torever in
bicycling lore and legend.

Perhaps some of you have seen
these racers ﬂashing by on their
magnificent steeds, and wondered
where they were going. Perhaps you
wished you could wheel away with
them to the freedom of the open road.
Wish no more, fellow cyclist, for you
can follow them!

There are also short local excur-'
sions on the longer town streets. These
familiar routes include: west on
Eleventh Avenue to Rock Creek, east
off East Street at the junior high to
the airport, and east at the end of
East street to Maynard Raffety's
iarm. All of these are pleasant jogs
for a Sunday morning spin.

There are also gravel roads nearby.
Supposedly, the gravel roads cross
the state in gridiron fashion around
every square mile, making it possible
to navigate anywhere among the corn-
fields.

These roads are not nearly as much

fun to ride on, except for the adven-

turous and those who enjoy lodging
particles of grime and filth into the
most intimate crevices of their
bicycles. But the local paved highways
offer enough challenge and variety to
keep any cyclist busy.

Indeed, the only possible drawback
to bicycling in Grinnell is a lack of
spectacular scenery. This might
bother some of you who think that
Iowa is nothing but farms and fields in
the middle of nowhere, but I have
quickly grown to appreciate the subtle
beauty and tranquility of the central
Iowa land and skyscape.

. The major drawback of riding in
this open country is dealing with the
relentless, and often malevolent, wind.
Riding against the wind is like trying
to run through a swimming pool, and
there’s no place to hide from Aeolus’
invisible hand. Consequently, it is
generally wise to ride out against the
wind, when you are fresh, so as to
have it at your back when returning.

The importance of the wind direc-
tion in planning a trip varies irom day
to day, and cannot be over-
emphasized. Although, it is sometimes
possible to fight a light headwind or
sneak through a crosswind.

A graphic demonstration of this was
the 1963 Tour de Kellogg, when
Ernesto Spumoni used an east wind to
establish a five-minute lead going out,
but burned out when faced with the
headwind coming back and was over-
taken by Guillermo distrange at the
finish.

Giro di Gilman

The Giro di Gilman, known in some
pedestrian circles as the Gilman
and/or Newburg Loop, is perhaps the
most adaptable and popular of the
local routes. The entire circuit is
about 25 miles, with the Newburg
Loop being about 15 miles. The roads
involved are U.S. Route (1 (eastrwest),
State Route 146 (north-south) and
country road T 38 (north~south). This
route forms a figure eight and allows
one to pass through the corners of
four, count ‘em four, counties: Tama,
Marshall, Jasper, and Poweshiek.

There is sometimes moderate traffic
on Highways 6 and 146, but cars
should not be too much of a problem
on this route (except that Todd von
Tot was nearly killed in the ‘71 race
when a Wonder Bread truck forced
him off the road and chased him into a
ditch).

Moreover, there are several ways to
get to and tram Gilman and Newburg,
so the itinerary can easily be altered
