To the Editor:

Once I went into Darby Gym the
day beiore a basketball game. l
went into the locker room where a
player was getting dressed for
practice. We exchanged greetings,
and then I asked him if he was
Starting tomorrow. He said that the
coach will start the best players
and said that all he could do was
try his best. (He did start.) I
thought a While, then another
player came in, i asked the same
question to him and got the same
answer. I realized that none of the
players cared too much if they
started or not They all like to play,
but they would rather not play and
win, than play and lose, knowing
that it someone else played they
would have had a better chance to
win,

I am a ballboy for football and
basketball, so I know all the
players pretty well, Some of the
players are modest, and some
aren’t. Once I told a player tl don’t
want to mention any names) that
he had twelve points with only ten
minutes gone in the game, He said
that he couldn't care less, all he
cared about was the points on the
scoreboard. I realized that he
would rather win than be the
leading scorer.

But these players aren't all
serious, oh no, [don’t want you to
get the wrong impression. AL
practice they practice very hard
but they joke around too. Once I
challenged our six-foot-seven
center to a one on one, Think of the
troubles I had because I’m only
{our foot seven.

Once some ballboys and Igot in a
snowball fight with “The Streak".
He was almost late tor practice
that day, but he didn't care
because he has a sense of humor.
We always take advantage of that.
(This would never have happencd
ii I was a ballboy for Coe, Knox,
Ripon, Lake Forest, Carleton,
Lawrence, Beloit or the University
of Chicago).

I hope you litve the same
teelings tor these players as i do,
They are the best bunch oi guys t
know.

Correction:

The Scarlet and Black has been
asked to correct a story (2-21-75—
p. 2) on the granting ol an honorary
degree to Fernando Flores. The
story stated that the Christian
Fellowship Group was supporting
the granting of such a degree. They
have intormed us that at this point
they have not reached a detinite
decision. During a presentation oi
the merits for giving Flores a
degree, a member oi the taculty at
their meeting stated that the
Christian Fellowship was sup»
porting the matter. We conveyed
his misinformation.

A disaster in the pause

by Jeitrey Millcr

The film World has seen many
types of movies come and go,
We’ve sat and suffered through all
kinds of detective movies, science
fiction movies, family movies,
student nurse movies, etc. We
seem to be now, however. in the
midst of one of the most stultining
of all film genres—the disaster
movie. These movies are typified
by high-priced casts, highorpriced
special effects, bargainrbasement
directors, and scriptwriters who
have made several guest apr
pearances on Marlin Perkins‘
“Wild Kingdom,” One would hope
that such schlock as “The Poseidon
Adventure” and “Airport 1975”
would be shovelled off the screen
into a vast pit in Louisiana
somewhere as quickly as
possible—but, alas, this is not to
be, We have recently received
press advances tor upcoming
disaster movies, so to forewarn
and torearm you, we now present
them publicly.

film appearance), Henry Aaron as
militant black revolutionary
Tinpan Ali, Cleavon Little as the
occupant ot the back seat, and
Lauren Becall as Sister Anna

Being male on this campus, 1
have often run into the more
violent side of libbies, Since every
woman on this campus considers
herself in some degree liberated
(especially those who are to no
degree liberated) and that some
even consider themselves God’s
gift to womankind, l teel con-
strained to write this even though it
contradicts my own credo, that
women, if liberation is to work,
must define themselves without
male intervention. But since I also
believe that what effects women
eitects men as well, and since
Feminism, like Lutheranism,
believes in the priesthood of all
believers (only with the
vengeance that distinguishes the
Mafia from the Salvation Army),
any women can preach a sermon
on liberation and it has the effect of
Holy Writ. Further most Iibbers
are so untogether that in their
preaching they not only perpetuate
old myths, they create new and
equally deadly ones, The ioliowing
examples are trom personal ex
perience.
