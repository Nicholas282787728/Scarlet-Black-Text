Excommunicuting' The Poor: An Allegory

by Jack Doppelt

The Office of Economic Opportunr
ity (OED) has been disestabiished.
Many of the poor and a substantial
portion of the general public were
astounded at the rapidity with which
the agency was abandoned. But was
the process so spontaneous?

In laid, a report was submitted
to the President by the Ash Come
mission on Government Organiza-
tion recommending that 01-20 be
abolished, The report, still secret,
suggested that the number of led-
eral departments be reduced be-
cause the bureaucracy was becomv
ing too intractable, and spreading
itself much too thin,

The report was considered by the
President, whose personal views
were very similar to the conclus—
ions enumerated in the report. Over
the next few years, 0E0 was clos-
eiy watched in an effort to calculate
its progress, eiticiehcy, and ne-
cessity. The Nixon administration
observed that 0150 was not really
beneiitting the poor enough tn jus-
tify its continuation in an era of
tight budgets and changing priorlr
ties.

This year seemed to be an ause
picious time to disestablish the CEO
partially because of the bureaucrat»
tic shuffle initiated at the beginning
of this administration which called
for the resignation of all cabinet
officers, White House appointees,
and Schedule C bureaucrats.

This issue of the SEIB will be
the last betcre Spring break.
We will resume publicationwith
an abbreviated issue on Friday,
March 30.

The proposal to disestahlish the
CEO, a modification of the orig-
inal Ash Commission report, was
presented to congress for appro-
val through the meticulous engineer-
ing of H, R. Haldeman, White House
aide. This was the first recognition
that most of the poor had concern—
ing the matter.

The rationale presented to Con—
gress emphasized the dilemma of
priorities with which the adminis-
tration had to grapple. The Ash
Commission proposal read, “(We)
do not contend that there is no such
problem as poverty nor that this
nation could not mount a program,
given a commitment thereto and
plenty of money, it does contend
that the status quo is unsatisfaCr
tory and that it sees no sanguine
hope of, or ultimate justification
for, committing substantial resour»
cc: to an expansion, given other
needs and demands."

The administration had to consider
three interrelated questions: What,
in the short run and long run, are
nationally desirable programs? wn-
at are financially feasible pro-
grams?

The administration stressed that
they were not deserting the poor,
by any means. As Mr. Haldeman
pointed out, most of the anti-pover-
ty programs would be rechanneled
into other departments, such as
Labor, HUD, and mainly illsw, Just
because the antipoverty program
does not have an official home, that
does not imply that the issue its
self has been abandoned.

As a matter of fact, Mr. Ash
took umbrage at a statement by a
citizen at one of the Congressional
hearings who Said that poverty was
something that everyone had to con-

To Sleep, 0r--

_ _ by Jim Alt .

i probably should not bring this up
at all, but i have been thinking about
classroom irritations. The subject
came to mind as I drifted off to
sleep in class.

Lest you get thewrong impression,
i am very conscientious and rarely
cut a class, even a boring one; but
I have few qualms about sleeping in
a bad one. Unfortunately, it a prof
is at all insecure, this places him
in an embarrassing position.

One poli sci prof trom whom i
have taken a number of courses,
and who seems not .to suffer much
irom insecurity, is excellent in this
regard. in his compassion, he has

nlten stopped class when l awoke.

and asked whether i slept well,

He is careful to keep his voice
down and, in fact, he makes it a
pleasure to sleep in his class.

But most other profs seem to
worry when they bore people to
sleep; and actually, 1 share their
concern. From my side of the lean
turn, it is terrible to be both bored
and unable to fall asleep. When i
cannot sleep I would like to be a-
mused, if not enlightened,

A class can be boring for a num-
ber of reasons. One is personal
lack of interest, for which i have
only myseli to blame. But there
are other causes, too.

First is the fact that a PhD. is
granted for scholarship and resear-
ch, rather than for teaching abil-
ity. if a prof cannot communicate
his thoughts to a roomful of people,
or it he consistently rambles offthe
subyect, or if he cannot keep the
bullshitters in line, then his Class
is likely to make me unhappy.
Ph.D.’s are not necessarily tear
chers. and a prof who is effective
in a one—to—one setting may be a
loser in a classroom.

Then there are the previously menr
tioned bullshitters, the bane of my
existence. A bullshitter is defined
as someone who I do not understand
or with Whom I do not agree. A chamr
plon bullshitter is someone who can
create this impression in an entire
class, and who does so with great
ireouency and in apparent ignorance
of his classmates' disgust.

i wish that more profs knew the
admiration and gratitude that they

could earn simply by interrupting
one of these champions with a pri-
ef, cogent observation » like “Bull-
shit!” I dream in vain of ever see—
ing this happen, and you know where
I do the dreaming.

Another deadly sort of class is
one in which nobody has done the
reading. I become acutely uncom—
fortable when a prof poses a ques-
tion which none of us can answer,
All eyes examine the floor, and
everyone freezes for fear of be-
coming the target of the prof’s
growing wrath,

at one of these moments, as the
seconds tick by and everyone tries
not to squirm, i always resent my
classmates for being so irresponr
sible. After all, if a few of them
had done the reading, I would not

be on the spot.
The reverse of this problem is the

class in which one individual is
clearly superior. This person has
always done the reading and invarr
iably has insightful, intelligent com-
ments to make. The person can be
the most charming, friendly, mod-
est person in the world, and there
will still be moments when I wish
to strangle him or her,

There is also a great variety oi
lesser classroom pests. There is
the clown who knocks full ashtrays
onto the ﬂoor (a category to which
I myself belong). There aretheknit-
ters, who 1 resent mainly because
they have something to do when
they are bored.

I am also vexed by the person who
sneaks (or worse, struts) into class
ten minutes late and proceeds to
ask a question which has already
been answered, I hate a class where
the discussion is dead until the last
five minutes, and is then Cut off by
the bell And I find it hard to [ore
give a prol who often lectures be-
yond the bell, especially if the
class immediately proceeds lunch.

Actually, though, i probably should
not complain about irritation and
boredom. Alter all, a column that
was conceived during a boring class
may itself suffer from the same
problem,

But I do ot have time to consider
the possib ity. You see, thebell has
finally rung,

I Saul Minsky

quer and this was not being valued
in other federal departments. Mr.
Ash, recently appointed head of the
Office of Management and Budget,
responded that poverty is dealt with
in one facet or another in every
tederal bureau and agency, and that
it is misleading to assume thatpov-
erty is only valued in the CEO,
Concern was expressed as to the
future of Howard Phillips, the dire
actor of SEC, now that 0E0 has
been disbanded, It was assured that
there was no intention whatsoever
of removing Mr. Phillips from gov-
ernment, and that a suitable posi-
tion would be found in the bureaus
cracy.

Many Congressmen and citizens
do not consider the battle over.
Many believe that the issue is dire
ectly related to the covert process
ses employed by the bureaucracy.
A charge was even levelled at the
President,,chastising him for los-
ing the trust of the public.

Amid all the Confusion, two facts
stand out. Both sides are sincere
about their concern over poverty,
even though the Nixon administra-
tion has often been accused of cal-
lousness. The question is one of
priorities and how they are per—
ceived.

What is also evident is that the
poor who have benefitted from 0E0,
no matter how small their perceh»
tage, now have to take their busin-
ess elsewhere,

A Matter Of Amnesty

by Gregg Definer

There are certain issues which
face our nation today which are so
repugnant yet clear, concise, and
simple to solve that the fact of
their lack of resolution points to
the very core of this nations proh~
lems. Such an _issue is the matter
of amnesty.

The question is one of rights -
individual rights. Does a nation
have the right to conscript its’
citizens and If so what does it do
about those who evade conscripe
tion? Or to View it from the other
side - Does a man have the right
not to serve his nation in the armr
ed forces?

Recognize what such a question
entails. One's answer requires not
only a concept of the nature oi a
man’s rights but also a functional
deiinition which one can apply to
the issue at hand. “A Right is a
moral principle defining and sanc-
tioning a man’s freedom of action
in a social Context." A man has
the right to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. But what is
the functional definition (rule) of
rights?

Simply stated it requires little
more than: ”No man has the right
to initiate physical force against
another man” , beyond this an in—
dividual has the right to do any»
thing. As such the definition is ex-
plicitly negative. Beyond this one’s
actions are a matter of conscience.

There are potentially two viola—
tors of this rule, private individuals

and government (ie. legalized for—,

ce). Clearly oi the two government
is the greater potential threat not
only because of its greater power
but more importantly because of its
nature — that of a legitimate or
sanctioned force. This is essentially
true of democracy,

The only moral purpose lnr goverrr
ment is to protect its citizens from
violations of their rights (i.e. of
their rule). However when govern—
ment itself violates the rights of
its citizens in a legal and system»
atic fashion the only moral response
is resistence. So long as that gov—
ernment maintains due process ior
such redress of grievances, the pro-
per kind ol resisience is througt
the system - that is by legal means.
When such means are no longer
available - when the ultimate act
which characterizes dictatorship is
established and freedom of speech
eliminated _ then revolution is nee
cessary. However until such time
active violation of the law invol-

ving conscious violation of rights
tor the purpose of destroying such
law is in effect an act to destroy
all law and generally should be
viewed as revolutionary in nature.

There are occasions when viola,
tion of law involves the violation
of no other person’s rights. The
clearest case of such action is
draft resistence in the form of evade
ing the draft,

The draft being such an institu-
tion, those who Chose to flee this
country escaping the draft did so
at a sacrifice of their own liberty,
To add insult to injury, there are
those who would continue their mad»
dness and further violate their rir
ghts, So great an injustice has ale
ready been done to so many that
welcoming them back with open
arms would be the only rational
solution, This alone could begin to
wipe the disgrace off our governs
ment,

However. few have argued in this
manner. Most suggest amnesty out

oi pity. Those who support the dr—
aft and amnesty are mistaken. Pror
perly if the drait were a moral
institution the renegades who evad»
ed it should be dealt the full sev»
erity of the law — for theirs would
then be the lowest possible trea-
son nextto actually aiding the ene-
my. Some new suggest a conditional
amnesty, Let them back into the
country but make them do social
work for the nation. The old Peace

Corps, Vista trip. This is the foul—
est of all possible worlds, it would
not only in eiiect be forcing them
into senseless servitude but be Cer-
tain slavery,

When the impending fight overam-
nesty comes there is only one hope
and one ground in its defense. lnr
dividual rights , full scale opPOSr
ition to the draft and its necessary
Corollary the initiation of coercion
by government. What IS at stake is
the very essence of freedom and
once again the only loser will be
you.

StevieWonder’s Talking Book

by Scott Mason

In a year when abyssmal crap
seemed to dominate both AM and
FM radio (“Candy Man” being No.
1 on the obnoxious single of 1972
list), a catchy little number called
“Superstition” seemed to stand out
far ahead of everything else. it had
the kind of beat that made you tap
your right tool involuntarily, caus-
ing the car (where else do you lis-
ten to AM radio?) to jerk through
trattic in crazy spurts of accelerar
tion, while your attention was die
verted irom the road as you sang
along with the lyrics. in short, the
ideal AM radio single. Stevie Won,
der had done it again.

Stevie, I’m told, got his start in
an Annette Funicello surf move
(“Beach Bunnies Go Bongo, Part
2", or something like that) but
his latest album, Talking Book, is
a far cry from those days of Krazy
Kats and Teenage Lust, In it, he
reveals himself as both a master
musician and lyricist' he does most
of the tracks himself, playing keyr
boards, synthesizer and drums, as
well as harmonica (remember “rie
ngertips"), and with the help of Syr
reeta and Yvonne Wright produces
beautiful, uncomplicated lyricsEar
ch song on the album is memorr
able, and a lew are destined to be
come classics.

”You Are The Sunshine Di My

Life" and “You've Got It Bad Girl”
are love songs in this latter group.
stevie sings them with more feeling
than i believed possible to capture
on a record, His vocalstyle hasbeen
extensively ripped bit by Edgar Win—
ter, who has also stolen from Bob-
by Bland and Ray Charles; lt’sgood
to hear the real thing again “Super-
stltion” and ”Maybe Your Baby"
are the movers, while “Big Bro-
ther” is Stevie's pointed comment
on Corporate White America, Nith
Liberty and Justice for Some, Most
of the album is low keyed nnd yust
plain pretty. though, and this is
where stevie shines through best.
There are a few artists around to
day who have this much ability
as both writer and performer; these
assets along with tremendous power
of Communication make Talking
Book the most reireshing thing l‘ve
heard ill a long time. If you're
tired of tortured "sensitive" sine
gels and luslelss ~~heavy metal"
bands, pick up on Stevie Wonder's
latest and see things through a bi-
ind man's eyes.
