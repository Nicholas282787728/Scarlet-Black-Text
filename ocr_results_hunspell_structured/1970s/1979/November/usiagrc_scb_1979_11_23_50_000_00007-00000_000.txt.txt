has mistaken him for a married man
and wants nothing to do with him. of
course, the only point of all that is to
let Astaire and Rogers dance, which
they do, as always, frequently and
very, very well.

This film has become a classic for a
very good reason. Astaire and Rogers
are possibly the best dance team
Hollywood ever produced and some of
their best numbers are in this movie.
Berlin wrote the score, which includes
such classics as “Cheek to Cheek" and
“Isn't This a Lovely Day." ,

The dancing, music, and comedy
combine to make this film a lot of fun.
You have to keep in mind that it was
made 45 years ago, so it can drag a
little, but on the whole, it’s not very
demanding or sophisticated; it can

weekend into something to be
remembered.

Tile other film scheduled for this
weekend is Gimme Shelter, Unfor-
tunately, as of this writing it hadn't
arrived on campus. but according to
Film Committee Co-Chairman Rob
Sakey, it s a concert movie featuring
the Rolling Stones, Jefferson Airplane,
and lke and Tina 'i'urner at Altamont.
The Stones wanted to show how a con-
cert is made, so there are shots of
them backstage and at indoor concerts
across the country (also—vwatch for
the Grateful Dead). The concert was
expected to be a westcoast Woodstock,
and from that point of View the ﬁlm is
90 minutes of good rock and roll.

But as you may know, what happen-
ed at Altamont Speedway in California
was far from what was expected,

Sakey explained that the Hell’s Angels '
in England are very different from the
American version, and the Stones

didn't know that when they hired the
American Hell's Angels as police for'

the concert. The Hell's Angels got

more than a little bit out of hand and

the rest, as they say, is history. Sakey
described the film as ”a documentary ,
which shows the other side of the ’60s ' '
It shows that the '605 weren’t all love,
peace, and ‘roses.’ So. from this very
different point of View, the film should

be a very interesting social commen-

iary on America in the ’603.

editorially speaking

B818: bogus and self-righteous

When the 3815 first came out, one could at least
say it was cute But the redeeming qualities of
the 3st soon ran thin, and now the publication' is
nothing but a tasteless ego trip for the several
students who put it out.

With the publication of the last issue, the 88:8
descended to a new low. The piece advocating an
early assassination of Ted Kennedy “for our own
sakes" is amazing It lacks logic and coherence;
the author’s contention that the Kennedys act out
of societab rather than self-interest is at least
naive and at most outrageous; at the bottom line
the piece is nothing but shabby trash.

But, defenders of the publication may be quick
to point out, the piece was written humorously. It
was just attempting to poke fun at the Kennedy
mystique and the American fascination with
death (in much the same way that Lewis Lapharn
did in the latest issue of Harper‘s). However, if
humor was the author’s purpose, he failed
miserably (and even the piece by Lapham, who is
considered by many an intelligent, competent
writer, was tasteless, arrogant and empty).

Writing humorous critiques is not easy—any
editor knows that. But whoever edits ( or ‘.‘p_uts ,
together") the 3&5 should have realized that-this-
piece had'no redeeming qualities and did not
merit publication.

This leads to another question: Does anything
in the BESx‘merit publication? The answer, of
course, is yes. In every issue there is usually at
least one piece that is not complete balderdash.

Yet there are other forums for such expression
Why don’t the B&Sers use these? Possibly
because such forums would force the writer to
reveal his identityiBStS writers seem afraid to
stand behind what they’ve written and afraid to

acknowledge their opinions.

The B&S claims to represent another side of
Grinnell: a questioning, intellectual, bright and
sensitive side. But this is a delusion. The B&S is a
product of a narrow-minded, self»righteous,
bigoted group of people.

B&Sers claim to have the inside track on
healthy, liberated sexuality, In reality, they’re a
group of terribly immature children who have ‘
recently found out they have a sexual side and
are now obsessed with it, Sex equals self-
gratification. '

It’s sad too: Grinnell once had underground
newspapers that were worth reading. Indeed,
often the B&Sers hark back to these days, but the
’60s at their worse were never anywhere near as

, pretentious as the B&S And few ’605 radicals

were afraid to have their names associated with-
their opinions -

B&Sers are concerned with one thing: ego trip-
ping. They “make their own rules”—just like in.
the ‘60s But in the ’605 ”making one’s own rules”
did not mean trampling someone else's rights.
Yet B&Sers do this all the time

A perfect example' IS one regular B&S writer,
who has the gall to have once served as judicial ‘
council chairman. He recently decided he could
make his own rules in the Forum, and proceeded
to spill beer over a wall He possibly didn’t
realize that someone would have to clean up his
excessiveness. For B&Sers “Make your own
rules" translates into screw everyone else.”

The B&S is fond of referring to the intelligent;
questioning Grinnell student. The 5&8 is proud of
that student too. But if that student really exists,
he won’t put up anymore with the excuse for
ideas which calls itself the B&S. 7
