by Alan Zond

Good solid hitting will be one of
the keys to a good season for the
Grinnell men's baseball team

IN PREPARATION for the
season, Ffitsch will be taking the
team down to Texas to play against
the Ranger Junior College team.
Ranger supplies many major
league teams with promising
young players.

Although the Pioneers won't play
Ranger's lirst team. they will
nonetheless be competing against
some very good ballplayers he
said. and this will give them
valuable experience for their
games against such teams as
William Penn and Central Iowa in
non-conference play. Pl’itsch Said
he hopes this will also give them
confidence in their potential when
they face the Conference tours
nament.

It's one of the strongest teams
I‘ve coached in recent years."
Pfitsch said.

The team is hopeful of their
conference chances. “I think we
have the potential [0 win the
conference." Charlie Gogel Said.
Jim Gilbert said. “The team ought
to be playoff material."

“offensively our hats are better
than any other single aspect."
Pfitsch said. Three of those hot
hats belong to Joe Nixon. Charlie
Gogel and Joe Mclinger. who are
the team's outlielders. ”All three
are veterans and‘"are‘ excellent
outfielder: said Pfitsch; '

GOGEL IS A senior. while Nixon
and Melinger are juniors. The
team is comprised of [our other
seniors: Steve Bolesta. Pete
Nierman. Robert Meyer. and Kurt
Kohlmann The team however.

does not rely on seniors alone, as 31
players came out for the squad.
“We have a lot more depth this
year." Pfitsch said.

Joe Nixon agrees. “There‘s a lot

or depth. especially in the pitching.

otiensively it looks pretty good.
There's a lotof experience. even in
the freshmen." he said

”Everyone is adept at playing
more than one position," said Bill
Pickett. Jim Gilbert said, “We
have a lot of returning talent from
last year. and much supportive
talent trom new players."

Pfitsch says although the
Pioneers do have offensive

' strength. they may have a problem

Students say yes to apathy

by Sm i bcuu

Apathy in Grinnell. you say? (‘an
{1 lack of interest really be
sweeping what was once rumored
to he the midwcst center of student
activism7

“Yes." seems to be the answer
given by leaders of most “activist"
organizations on campus. MOBE
[Mobilization for Survival)
coordinator Anne Rawland says
[here is apathy mainly because
[he organizations have become
more moderate. “The groups
aren't speaking out as much as
[hey should," she said.

MORE PlttlI’tlSI-IS four main
goals: to ban nuclear weapons.
Stop the arms race. ban nuclear
power and “illeet human needs."
Rawland said. Despite-these
proposals. Rawland said there are
only live to ten regulars Who attend
mostof the weekly meetings, but at
any given time as many as 20
people may attend meetings.

Still. Rawland says she is ops
timistic about her organization.
“Even though we're right in the
middle of a conservative time now.
i believe we have been building up
interest." she said. “For example.
last [all in Palo we had 30 people
participate in that antinuclear
power protest. Theisame th‘
occurred severai 'week's‘a‘go‘iime
MOBE was involved in a
demonstration in Chicago.”

MONEY IIAS FROVEN to be the
big problem tor MOBE at these
demonstrations. “Our problem
then was not so much participation
as it was money, More students
wanted to go to Fall) and Chicago
but we simply did not have the
funds to pmvide transportation for
everyone.“ '

Grinnell chapter of the Iowa Public
interest Research Group says
apathy has posed a big problem lor
her group “What happens is the
small group of people who do
participate become disillusioned
iind consequently give up." she
said. “It gets disheartening when
no one shows up. One cannot help
but feel that this group is not ace
complishing anything."

.\I Tllot‘ml lPlliti's mem-
bership has not declined this year.
'it has not increased cither. Koyes

participants—and this mem-
bership is about the same as it was
last year. she said. Despite the
small amount of participation.
IPIRGhas had some success in
achieving its goals, Kcyes said.

“IFIRG is basically interested
with the problems on campus and
the Iowa community. We like to
work out proposals through the
legislature. The passing or the
bottle bill last year was partially
due to the ellorts of our
organization."

”It just d ork out. Apathy
plays a part— ut I think it‘s just
that people are developing
themselves in other things. It is
sort of a mellowing out period." he
