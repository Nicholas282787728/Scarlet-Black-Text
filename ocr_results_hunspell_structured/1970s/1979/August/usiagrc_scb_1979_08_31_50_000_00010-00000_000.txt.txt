Reorganization: uncertainty at the top

by Dan Flynn

While most of the campus seems ex-
cited by the prospects oi working with
President George Drake, there is
disgruntlement among members of
the top administration.

Uncertainty and some confusion has
followed Drake’s decision to imple
ment a plan which will eliminate two
highrlevel administrative positions and
reduce tlle duties of another,

Affected by the plan are: Waldo
Walker, currently provost and dean of
the college; Vice Provost Ken Brown-
ing; and Roger Koester, assistant
dean and director of off-campus
studies.

Walker is being relieved of his

the dean of the laculty, a position
which, as of yet is not clearly defined.
Drake indicates that Roger Koester's
duties will also be absorbed into this
position.

This could create another position
which is too much for one person to
handle—in which case Drake suggests
that a part- -time assistant to the dean
would be hired.

The Changes are ironic in light of a
similar reshuffling of administrative
positions that occured just three years
ago. That was when the combined
position of provost and dean of the col
lege was created by then President A.
Richard Turner. Turner explained
that one of the aims of his reorganizar

much for one person to do.”

Walker: . . I've been doing it
(the job) for several years.”

 

duties as dean of the college He will

stay on as provost, absorbing also the
duties oi Browning, whose position is

being eliminated.

While a trustee, Drake and some of
his colleagues agreed mat the dean
provost position implied a conilict of
interest. “The marrying of the
budgetary function to the dean of
structure is not ideal," Drake
stresses. “It is hard to fuse these
jobs,” .

The conflict arises because the
dean, as the faculty‘s senior oiiicer,
should be pushing the faculty s in
terests, while the provost IS charged
with overseeing the college s fiscal' ln-
terests

Drake emphasizes that the move
should not be construed as an indictr
merit of Walker's performance in the
combined position. “Wally has done a
fine job,” he says.

Another factor in Drake's decision
was the workload involved in the com-
bined position. Although Walker had
never complained, Drake said, “The
job is almost certainly too much for
one person to do,”

To remedy the problem, Drake pro»
poses having a provost and a position
tentatively called dean of the iaculty.
in his position as provost, Walker will
continue as the college's chief adr
miliistrative official. He will, however,
no longer be involved in curricular al-
fairs.

These duties will be taken over by

tion was to “concentrate matters
regarding faculty affairs, curricular
affairs and final responsibility for the
college budget in the hands of the
dean of the college.”

The reorganization also hoped to
make the administration more effi-
cient and eliminate redundancy in
positions. The changes also created
the vice provost position, giving it the
duties of overseeing much of the day
today tiscal operations or the college,

in Turner’s reorganization, two top
administrators also found themselves
without positions,

Reaction to the shake-up has varied.
0n the surface, Walker seems at least
satisfied with the change; when the
decision was announced at the facul-
ty's opening meeting, Drake said that
he and Walker had agreed on it

Walker says that although he has
enjoyed his job as it is now, “Ill do
other things and be happy at them. If
it works for the betterment of the cola
lege, then that‘s fine."

But he would not say that he feels
the change will improve college opera-
tions. To do so, he said, would be to
imply the college has not worked well
the last few years. He also did not air
firm that the Workload is too heavy for
one person. ". . . I’ve been doing it for
several years," he said.

A source close to Walker indicates
that Walker is “very unhappy" with
the reorganization,

Koester and Browning have explicit

ly expressed unhappiness over the
changes. Browning, who assumed the
vice provost job during the summer of
1973, said he was “surprised and
disappointed." Browning had hoped
for a longer tenure at Grinnell as
evidenced by his efforts to develop a
cohesive, longrange energy program
for the college,

He currently has no specific plans
tor the iuture, although he hopes to re-
main in the Midwest. “OK, I’ve got
another year here,” he said, “I see it
as an opportunity to do things for the
college and tor myself. i hope to get
some experience here that can
transfer to another position.” The an-
nouncement, he said, was “a shock,"

Koester also spoke frankly about the
change. “Obviously, i had a personal
feeling. The decision couldn‘t have
been made with a close eye to my
position. The new dean now will have
two full time jobs," he said.

He, too, has no firm plans for the
future, though he has made some in-
quiries. He sees himself as having two
options: staying in college administra
tion, or going into business,

He says that his job “may not be
done with the success and efficiency
with which I have run the job, because
it may he tilled as a part-time posi~
tion."

President Drake stresses that the
changes ”have nothing to do with the ‘
competency of these individuals. . , I
hated to make a decision that involved
people's jobs. , but one has to be fair-
ly hardrheaded.”
