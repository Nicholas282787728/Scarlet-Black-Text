Philly romp ; Hitchcock

The beginning of the year seems to y

be one of the times when the best
films come on campus, and this year
is no exception. The Philadelphia
story, starring Katharine Hepburn,
Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant, will
be here this weekend, along with
Alfred Hitchcock’sl-‘amily Plot and
RobertoRossellini’s The Rise of Louis
XIV, The Philadelphia Story (1940) is
a madcap comedy about high society
in Philadelphia. Katharine Hepburn
plays Tracy Lord, a rich heiress who
is about to be married when her ex-
husband (Cary Grant) shows up with
a reporter (Jimmy Stewart) who
pretends to be an old friend of the
family. A party before the wedding
leads to an affair (almost). a broken
engagement, and several proposals
before we reach the inevitable happy
ending,

George Cukor directed the film,

which boasts magnificent perfor-
mances by Hepburn (as always),
Grant, and an excellent supporting
cast. Jimmy Stewart turns in one of
his best performances ever as
Macaulay Connor, a frustrated author
forced to write for a secondrrate
gossip-society magazine, and Virginia
Weidler is nearly perfect as the bride
to-be’s obnoxious little sister.

Family Plot (1m) is the story or a
semi-legitimate psychic (Barbara
Harris) and her lover(Bruce Dem) ‘
who are trying to locate a missing
heir, What they don't know is that the
missing heir (William Devane) is ac—
tually a high-class and very successful
kidnapper who doesn’t want to be
found.

The acting is very good all the way
around and me cinematography is
brilliant in spots. The film tends to
drag in the middle (as Hitchcock often

film/tom spackman

returns

does), but the end is worth waiting
for. This isn’t one of Hitchcock’s best:
films, but it’s better than most ‘
thrillers; there are moments when we. .
see Hitchcock's familiar genius at
work. .
The third movie this weekend, The
Rise of Louis XIV (1965), is one of a
series of historical films made by
Roberto Rossellini for Italian televi- , i >
sion. According to critic Steven
Scheuer, “It’s an absorbing film and '_-
an invaluable history lesson . . . The
Sun King is presented as the complex,
bizarre figure he surely was. Superb
underplayed portrait of the King, . . "
If you have any suggestions for
movies you would like to see at Grins
nell, the Film Committee would like to
hear them. The co-chairmen for the
Film Committee this year are Rob
Sakey and Larry Finder; any suggesr
tions can be put in their mailboxes in
the campus post oiiice.
