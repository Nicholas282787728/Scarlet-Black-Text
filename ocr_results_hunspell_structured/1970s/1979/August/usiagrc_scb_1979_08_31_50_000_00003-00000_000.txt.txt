Greet the ‘new loo/2’ 36B

In case you haven’t noticed, the S & B looks very dif-
ferent from last year. The venerable newspaper format has
been replaced by a more lively magazine format.

The drastic physical change of the publication is in-
dicative of equally drastic structural and philosophical
changes. The editors felt that the S & 8 had reached a
logical conclusion in it 5 development as a newspaper: the
format was too limited.

So we moved to a magazine design: more modern and
readable. With this change came a change in writing style.
Our stories will now have a more free~flowing, conversa-
tional style— but this change will not imply a lessening of
journalistic standards and objectivity.

We are still the campus’ main news organ and will con-
tinue to fulfill that function as we have in the past.

But now, there will be more emphasis on creative
writing, special interest features, and provocative opinion
pieces. Our aim is to be more readable and enjoyable for
you,

To do that, we have to know what you want— so write us
or call us. We‘re always glad to print letters to the editor
or longer ”open space" submissions. Let us know if you
like the crossword puzzle, we’ll do it again, If you hate
Dave Blatt’s column, tell us.

The S & B is the magazine of the Grinnell College com-
munity, and the editors are quite willing to adapt to the
tastes of that community—though always fulfilling our
charge as the campus’ primary news organ.
