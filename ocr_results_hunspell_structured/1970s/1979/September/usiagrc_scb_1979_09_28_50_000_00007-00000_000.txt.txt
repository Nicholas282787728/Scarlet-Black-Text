Tempers ﬂare as Pioneers kick Carleton

by Rob Sldon

Last saturday, during Parents’
Weekend, the men’s soccer team upset
Carleton College, the defending con-
ference champion, by a score of 24).

Ten minutes into the first quarter,
the Grinnell offense began to break
away. On a corner kick, Dave
Strongin chipped the ball over the goal
mouth, where Doug Rowe drove a

head-shot right into the net. The score -

was 1~D

Soon afterward, Ruwc faced the
Carleton goalie oneron»one in another
breakaway. Missing the follow-up on
his first shot. Rowe accidentally kick-
ed the goalie in the mouth.

The game was interrupted and a
fight nearly ensued as a Carleton
fullback accused Row- nl til king the
goalie deliberatelyr'l‘he officlats judged
that it was a “loose ball," so there
was no penalty on Rowe.

After the game, Grinnell coach John
Pfitsch took the goalie to a local den-
tist, who diagnosed a probable loss of
the player's front teeth.

When the game resumed, the
Carleton players showed anger, and
the game became more physical. On
occasion, there were antagonistic
flare-ups and some penalties called,
but neither team dominated control of
the ball. ”Despite some tension," said
Pfitsch, “there was good passing and
good field movement.”

At one point in the second quarter,
Grinnell‘s defense was under constant
pressure from Carleton’s offensive
drive. But there was a quick tur-
naround, and a breakaway. Rowe took
the ball down the field, stopped, and
centered the ball to Jim Rounsevell,
whose shot was deflected by the
goalie. Adam Thornton kicked it in off

“the toughest game on our schedule,”
