Confronting the draft

ast few months there has
sturbing move toward
reinstall a peacetime draft. There
were, until Sept. 12, ten bills
pending in Congress which called for
registration and[or some form of a
draft. On Sept. 12, the sections of
HR. 4040 dealing with the draft were
defeated, While their defeat decreases
the likelihood of any draft bills pass-
ing, we should not allow it to give us a
false sense of security.

One major argument put forward by
proponents of the peacetime draft is
that it is neccessary for national
security. Since the armed forces are
not reaching their recruitment quotas,
it is argued, the draft represents the
only reasonable alternative to leaving
a serious gap in the military
preparedness of our country.

According to General Robert H,
Barrow, head of the U.S. Marine
Corps, “To keep the ranks of all the
services filled these days, military
recruiters must sign up an average of
1000 volunteers a day. 365 days a year.
We’re doing it, but with difficulty.”

Further, according to Represen-
tative Les Aspin (D-Wis.), ”When we
try to judge the all-volunteer system
by looking at recruiting statistics,
we‘re getting a very distorted pic-
ture.” The military services, he has
stressed, have been recruiting bet
ween 98 and 99 percent oi me people
Congress has authorized ever since
the draft ended.

Another argument put forward
under the guise of protecting national

find and classify draftees in time to
replace early casualties.
Those who put forward this argu-

ment ignore the evidence of history. in ‘

the first so days of WW II, 16,500,000
people registered for the draft, and
mass inductions began one month
later. The Defense Department
estimates an average number of
volunteers in the event of a major
European war at 35,000 per month,
But, in the first two months after
Pearl Harbor, 350,000 men
volunteered.

Another fact which supporters of a
peacetime draft conveniently ignore is
that 50 percent of the Army Individual
Ready Reserves have no mission other
than to replace soldiers lost in come
bat, and 25 percent have no planned
mission in the first six months of any
war. Given these facts, it is quite
clear that there Will be Sufficient time
for wartime mobilization without the
peacetime draft.

Aside from the fact that a peacetime
draft is unneccessary, the institution
of the draft, by its very nature,
represents a grave infringement of
personal civil liberties. lt forcibly
removes selected men and women
from civilian life and places them
within a highly regimented military
machine in which individuality is lost,
and the rights they possessed as
civilians are sharply curtailed.

Another Blatt on disco

To the editor: Iwas appalled to see
David Blatt's recent column suppor-
ting disco. I feel that anyone who
would write such an utterly nonsen-
sical piece of fanatical drivel (to say
nothing of posing seductively in an
openneched shirt, revealing a Phi
Beta Kappa key) should have his little
Brillo head careiully examined.

_A character such as this “Doctor
Disco” could prove dangerous and/or
slightly amusing to the Grinnell com-
munity. I urge the staff of the S o B to
get this young man to a qualified
therapist or into a black satin straight-
jacltet as soon as possible. sincerely,

Blasts SGA on B63 funding

To the editor: A gross injustice, one
of many, has been perpetrated by the
Joint Board and therefore by'every
member of the Grinnell community.
The injustice was the refusal to give a
paltry $50 for the publication of a stu-
dent paper. The paper, the 3&5, came
to the community to provide a forum
for creative expression of uncommon
views. The SGA’s refusal to grant the
funding amounts to an attempt to
stomp out opposing political positions
and to maintain the dreary status quo.
We of the 8&5, and our supporters,
find their position putrid and hereby

declare all out war on complacancy
and close~mindedness. We need your
support. If your would like to cone
tribute money, support, or work, we

As many a great philosopher has
pointed out, debate, when allowed to
run its course, will arrive at the truth
but governing in the interest oi expe
diency will never reveal anything.

The need of the Grinnell College
community for a freewheeling forum
of open expression is tremedous; the
3&5 is the way With ANARCHY and
LOVE. The Staff of the 88:5

Five of the ten bills mention the
establishment of a centralized inforr
mation system for maintaining draft
records drawn from school files and
other records. We need not dwell on
the Orwellian implications of such a
system! Since the security risks of an
allrvolunteer army are nearly non
existent, there can be no justification
of such a tomlitarian entity. We need
only look at the two Red Scares of this
century, and at the recent activities of
the C.l.A, and F.B.l., to see the
danger present in using national
security as an excuse for the cirv
cumvention of basic civil rights.

Thus, the establishment of a
peacetime draft is both unnecessary
for the security or our country, and in
severe violation of basxc civil rights
necessary for the maintainence of a
free society. It is the moral respon-
sibility of every free citizen to do
whatever he/she can to prevent this
legislation from being enacted.

What can you do? Find out who your
elected representatives are—write to
them; sign Mobe's petition against
the draft, and, in general, keep
yourself well-informed concerning this
issue.

Defends musicians

To the editor: In response to Diane

Fisher’s crit' sm of Vassar Clements
in the Sept. 21 issue of the 5&8:

What a tiresome refrain! Musicians
are often accused of having sold out.
The accusations invariably come from
fans who feel betrayed when an artist
chooses a new direction.

That's only natural. But Fisher is
unaware of the reality of the musxc
business, An appalling number of or
tists have suffered simply for lack of
work. The dilemma lacing many
musicians can be stated succinctly:
Either starve and play what your sen-
sibilities dictate, or earn your bread
pounding out Feelings, Why begrudge
Vassar Clements a larger audience
and the money that comes along with
one?

Possibly, Vassar is tired of playing
traditional bluegrass. If that’s the
Case, so be it, There is no sense in in-
sulting him for that reason“,
