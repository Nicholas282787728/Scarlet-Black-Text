Altman’s work: no imisll-M" A" 3* ll

Robert Altman is more than a
director, he's an experimenter and an
innovator who is consistently trying to
add new dimensions to an often
stagnat medium. ,

Altman's record the past ten years
is evidence of his fearlessness in tak-
ing risks. He has released 13 films,
each unique. A Perfect Couple, his
most recent film, joins the varied
ranks of films like M‘A‘S‘H. Brewster
McCloud, Images, Thieves Like Us,
Nashville, and Quintet.

In 1969, after directing TV’s
“Bonanza,” Altman released That
Cold Day in the Park. This was follow-
ed by M‘A'S‘H' in 1970, which earned
Altman the Grand Prize at the 1970
Cannes Film Festival.

After the release of Brewster Mc-
Cloud in 1971, Altman began to
develop a cult following. Then came
McCahe and Mrs. Miller, The Long
Goodbye, and California Split. Altman
made an early bicentennial offering
with Nashville in 1975. He has con-
tinued his incredibly prolific pace with
Buffalo Bill and the Indians, Three
Women. A Wedding, and A Perfect
Couple since mat time.

Lately, Altman has expanded into
writing and producing films. He pro-
,duced Welcome to L.A., The Late
Show, and Remember My Name.

There are many similar
characteristics in Altman's films
which have earned him a dedicated
following. To some, he has a reputa-
tion as being one of die greatest living
directors. Clever use of images,
character development, music, satire,
and photographic technique have set
Altman apart from contemporary

‘W’iey’ - more

When a paperback book's cover
displays the chest, tummy, and naval
or a nude woman, it would be an ap-
propriate guess to think it “dirty."
Though Judy Blume's new release,
“Wifey,” sports such a cover, and
goes one step further by having a
slogan which describes the book as the
"story of a very nice housewife with a
very dirty mind,” it most certainly is
not centered around flagrant sex.

For years, Blulne has written for
children, but escapes her image as a
“children’s writer” in “Wifey.”

The story is of an upper-class
American housewife, dissatisfied with
a life of posh sports clubs, topless pool
parties, and pretending to enjoy a life
whichyhas been chosen for her. She
feelsunloved and frustrated, so she
turns to former lovers for understanr

filmmakers.

The most important aspect of
Altman films is the way in which they
focus upon characters and per-
sonalities, rather than plot. Nashville
and Brewster McCloud are good ex-
amples of how Altman puts together
images and situations to provide
detailed portraim of his characters.

In his career, Altman has addressed
a wide variety of characters and sub

ject matter, proving hi‘s adaptability.

In most of the films, Altman depicts
social satire or parodies an institution.
The satire is complex, with Altman
allowing the viewer to come to his own
conclusions.

Altman strives to create a realistic
atmosphere and offer an important
social messagv "M . Hr Altman has
said. “is not in crealt a work of art,
but to reflecl the prcocss or it "

A festival of Altman

'Four Robert Altman films are
featured this weekend: Quintet,
Brewster McCloud, Nashville, and Mc-
Cahe and Mrs. Miller.

Brewster McCloud. a satirical come
edy, is believed to be Aim-fan’s
favorite film Bud Cort (Harold and
Maude) stars as a boy who wants to
fly and commences to build a huge set
of wings in a secret room in the
Houston Astrodome.

Sally Kellerman plays a fallen angel
who aids Brewster in his quest until he
becomes involved with a tour guide,
portrayed by Shelley Duvall.

An elicellent chase scene and
Altman's use of color highlight this
film.

Quintet is the most recent and most
underrated of the Altman films here
this weekend. Paul Newman and Ferr
nando Rey star in the film which
Altman not only directed, but producV
ed, Altman also co—authored the ‘
screenplay.

. The plot of Quintet revolves around

“Whey” cooks potroast on
Wednesdays, gives her husband sex on
Saturdays,'and tries not to think all of
the time. That is, until she begins to
realize that she is not happy.

Blume also emphasizes that sex,
however sensationalized, can form
bonds of friendship between two peo-
ple, becoming more than just “a little
something” on Saturday night. in the
novel, sex is more of an expression of
iriendship than an act of physical

' desire,

As a result of “Wifey’s” alternative
friendships, she and her husband
brush with divorce. Although he
resolves to change and “somehow
make things work out," there is
always the subtle suspicion that hubby
is merely trying to avoid divorce so he
can keep his membership at “the
club," and still have a woman around

a Russian Roulette-type game played
in the distant future, after nuclear war
has destroyed most of humanity.

A fine script and good set design
helps make McCabe and Mrs Miller a
successful comedy western. Warren
Beatty stars as a gambler who is talk-
ed into setting up a business by a pro-
stitute, played by Julie Christie. Once
the gambler is established, he is con-
fronted by mobsters who demand that
he sell out or be shot.

Nashville, winner of Best Film and
Best Director awards at major film
festivals abroad, is Altman's bicenten-
nial message.

Henry Gibson. Lily Tomlin, and
Karen Black head a cast which
features many cameo performances
by familiar screen stars.

Don’t be deceived by the title:

Nashville has little to do with country
music or even the city of Nashville,
Tenn, Altman uses the backdrop of the
city to take a satirical look at morals,
music, relationships, and most of all,
American values and politics.

than a little something

to cook for him, etc.

Elume shows symbolically that this
is a pseudo-solution. In the beginning
of the book, an unnamed motorcyclist
drives up on her lawn and mastur-
bates. “Wifey” cowers ln the dining
room and calls the police At the end
of the story, the motorcyclist returns,
but this time she runs outside to
ask the man who he is, only to
frighten him away.

This attempt to Communicate with
someone who terrified her before, il-
lustrates “Wiley's” change ill her at
titudes about sex But after the incir
dent, she strolls back into the house,
thinking, “The kids are coming home
from camp, and we’re moving soon,
Soon I‘ll be busy again .,

The pattern of “Wifey's” life is un~
changed; the cycle oi events which
began the story could begin again.
Her problems are not yet over.
