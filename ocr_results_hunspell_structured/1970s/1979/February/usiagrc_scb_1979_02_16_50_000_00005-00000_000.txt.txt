Urges release of pent-up energy

What with a record 734 degrees
here last week and the inevitable
thickening of academic activity.
many people think they suiier irom
a malady known as February
cabin fever. The thought of a
friend, however, leads me to
believe not all of us have cases of
midrwinter, beginningrofrther
semester restlessness.

My friend provided me with the
clue to the mysterious disease one
afternoon last semester during
finals. Sitting in the Forum grill,
she described to me symptoms
greatly resembling the current
cabin iever epidemic. it turned
out, though, another name
belonged to her malaise,

She confessed that day to ieeling
restless, though she couldn't figure
out why. She’d been studying hard
all semester. She was caught up
and doing fine in her classes. Still,
she said she didn’t feel like she was
really doing anything. The source
of her pent-up energy was a puzzle
to her, expecially since she'd been
working so hard,

 

OUR CONVERSATION turned to
reminiscences of active
high school days. She‘d played bas-
ketball, ran track, and spent lots of
time throwing pots on the wheel in
the art studio. Coming from a
small rural town, she often hiked,
skied and camped in the area
where she lived. Her mother’s
political involvement in local
issues made her especially aware
of envtronmental issues. During
her high School years she worked
for her mother on several enr
vironmental projects.

As she went on to compare her
high school and college lives, it was
apparent my friend, like many
people, changed her lifestyle
significantly upon coming to
Grinnell. Like many otheis, she
came here considering study as a
restrictive activity. Since her
ireshman year she hadn’t done
much in the way of pottery or
athletics. Although she monitored
in the craft workshop a couple
nights a week, she usually cleaned
the workshop or studied instead of

brouhaha brews

I was right in the middle of
shooting up Wednesday night when
some guy burst into my room
holding several pounds oi Squid
and brandishing a mole trap, He
informed me that there‘s a big
brouhaha on campus concerning
co-ed bathrooms.

Well. issueminded young citizen
that l am. I immediately put down
my revolver and flew out to
California to set up an interview
with Alan (Don't worry, it’ll
sponge right up) Kissane,
proiessor of ceramic tile at the
University of Calif. Davis and
director of the Center for F‘rit-
tering Away the Grant Money at
Cheap Bars and Not-SOVchutable
Motels. His expertise will, I‘m
sure, be more respected than mine,
since i have a very pretentious
Christ-image George Harrison
poster on my wall, upside down.

The followtng is an exact trans-
cript of my interview with him,
which took place in the restroom of
a Lear jet en route to the Ivory
CoastiMr, Kissane refuses to be
interviewed while more than five
feet irom a drain—at the expense
of the Scarlet and Black. (Con-
sequently the price oi single issues
has gone up from free to five
dollars a shot, and l have a great
tan )

J: You are aware of the current
controversy at our school” '

K: Yes, I was wrapping up some

 

old carp last week when'l ran
across an 5&3 article on the sub-
'ect.

J J: Just what is the difference
between using cared and singlerscx
johns?

K: Well, with the coed type you
sometimes have to look at the
inside oi the pants of the opposite
sex, maybe catch a glimpse of
underwear, and occasionally a bit
oi ankle or calf in a neighboring
stall. Of course. if you're really
industrious, employing the use of
small mirrors or sheets of
aluminum foil shoved under the
stall, you can get a really good
peak or, if your shine your shocss,
to an incredible lustre and sort Elf
poke one under the partition . . . ,

J: 1 sec! (Damn. All mine are
suede.) in light of the rising ten
dency for fuddy-duddy, Eisena
howeresque attitudes concerning
the future oi coed crappers, how
can the liberal minded student help
to foster progressive thought ill
this matter?

K: It's not that difficult. Little
things like throwingrup in the
Mears 3rd, women only, no men
whatsoever bathroom, should you
happen to be a boy and, for the
ladies, taking all the bolts ...

throwing pots.

THE SMALLNESS 01" the
campus bothered her too, she
complained Walking the short
distances from the dorm to meals
or classes didn't give her much
time to notice the scenery or even
to daydream. Only twice or three
times a month did she get outside
to run or even walk. And her time
was too tight, she explained, to get
involved with the environmental
group on campus.

At the time we tried to brush
away my friend's troubled ieclings
by blaming them on finals and the
cold weather. A few weeks ago we
spoke with each odler and realized
there'd been more at the root of her
restlessness than school and
weather. She reported that running
a few miles every other day on
country roads (between the drifts)
was using up some energy, That
morning, she continued, She’d
thrown a few pots. Those two
energy»releasing, creative ac-
tivities made her feel like she was
doing something concrete with her
life besides studying, she said, at
least temporarily.

WITH MY FRIENDS not un»
common dilemma and partial
solution on my mind, l've noticed
lately how other people manage to
break out of the inactivity groove.
in my collegeowned house we
seem to channel lots oi energy into
the kitchenibaking at least a
batch of cookies a day land eating
them), not to mention the bowls of
popcorn consumed nightly. And
late aiternoons, the living room
turns into an athletic club:

the Pub at least a few seniors who
finally have time to actively

life, since this last semester their
“orkloads are lighter than before,

One person I know calls all this
channeling of energy into non»
academic pursuits "catching up on
life.” Some people “catch up"
once a day; some do it on the week
ends. Some, like the seniors
in the Pub, stick it out for a few
years before they try the difierent
way of living that lots of us ignore
while going to school. Energy is

UNITED STATES policy on
foreign military sales has been
capricious, shaped often by the
differing and sometimes con-
tradictory desires of the State
Department, the Defense
Department, arms manuiacturers,
and the sporadic intentions of
Congress. American arms sales
are authorized more as a reaction
to events abroad than as a
reflection of a consistent foreign
policy.

What can be done? Well, in
ternationally we must work with
the other major NATO arms
peddleis (especially France and
Great Britain) to restrict Com»
petion in armament sales. We
must then unite to negotiate arms
export limits with the Warsaw
Pact forces,

AT THE NATIONAL level we
must push for the formulation of
peace conversion plans—every
weapon producing facility must
develop a potential alternative
peaceiul purpose. The \vorkers'
skills. the physical plant and
machinery used in building
bombers could just as easily be
applied to the production of mass
transit systems

Military spending is un.
productive in generating jobs. The
high cost of materials involved and
guaranteed profit from the
government (with the resultant
high degree of waste) decreases
spending in the economic sector
and puts more people on the
unemployment linc.

Lastly, we must Show political
leaders, through letter»writing
campaigns and protest action, that
we care

Now you know what's wrong nntl
what needs to be done. The MORE

Fund human needs! Zero
nuclear weapons! Stop the arms
race!
