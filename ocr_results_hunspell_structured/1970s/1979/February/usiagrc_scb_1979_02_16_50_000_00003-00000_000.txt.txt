Proxy season opens

by Mark Finkelsteiii

Shareholder resolutions con-
cerning corporate involvement
with the Union of South Africa will
dominate the upcoming "proxy
season." says Stan Levels of the
Investor Responsibility Research
Center.

But South Africa will probably be
the subject of only one of at least
six shareholder resolutions lacing
Grinnell’s Board of Trustees and
Corporate Responsibility Oil'icer
David Crosby between now and the
summer, which is when the maj»
ority ofsharehulder resolutions are
dealt With.

THE BOARD‘S Finance Cotiiiii
ittee Will probably be asked to it c t
on .' : resolutions which ask:

lBM. inc. to investigate
allegations that its computers are
being used for repression in Latin
America;

r\etn'.i Life and Casualty (the
college's largest holding of com-
mon stock) to discontinue its policy
of insurance redlining—that is, the
denial of insurance solely on the
basis oi" residence;

American Tcicpiione
Telegraph to include
representation on its board:

Ford Motor Co. to end all sales to
the South African military and
police;

U.S. Steel to stop expansion of its
South African facilities, and;

Mobil Corporation to deal with
black South African trade unions.

Crosby, as the Board’s Corporate
Responsibility Oiiicer, monitors
proxy resolutions, and notifies the
Board's Finance Committee of how
he wishes to vote Traditionally,
the committee has accepted the
officer’s recommendation.

UNDER THE PROCEDURE es
tablished last year, Crosby will
wait several weeks beiore
notifying the committee in order to
receive opinions on the resolution
from interested persons on cam-
pus.

“South Africa will remain the
dominate issue of this year's proxy
season," said Levels. ”Of the 110
resolutions Submitted in the in-
vestor responsibility area, 35 deal

LAST FALL. because of the
complexities and importance oi
investor responsibility questions,
the SGA began organizing a
Committee on Corporate
Responsibility. Although all
positions on the committee have
not been filled. Rob Henak will be
chairman and the Committee will
consist of five students and two
iaculty members. Henak ex
pressed hope that the committee
“will open the channels of in-
ﬂuence tor the average Grinnell
student.”

Henak is dismayed that “the
iproxy) issues rank low on most
student's priorities.” And he said
he was disappointed by Maytag’s
explanations of last year's proxy
votes. "He voted against them {or
two reasons. He said they were
irrational and would hurt return,
but no one expected them to pass
anyway. What's important is for
management to get the message
and make some changes."

Sino-Soviet policy reviewed

By Dali Blunt

Public understanding of super
power politics has sharpened.
State Department Soviet expert
Susan Gust said at a special forum
on SinorSoviet relations held on
campus this week.

“People have a lot of Concern
about SAL she said, “They
have a basic understanding oi
arms control. They certainly want
to know what the agreement ens
tails. so I’ve found that the public's
level of sophistication over the last
few months is generally in-
creasmg."

GUST AND HER colleague
Donald M ‘ Anderson visited
Grinnell last Tuesday as part oi the
State Department's Public Affairs
Bureau program. This program
makes speakers available to
discuss major foreign policy issues
at colleges and other institutions.

The two officials each spoke on
economic. political, and cultural
change in their respective areas of
expertise. Anderson is currently

Desk’ at the State Department,
