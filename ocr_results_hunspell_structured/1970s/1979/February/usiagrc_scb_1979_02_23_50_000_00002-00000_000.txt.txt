CSL: dogs in off-campus housing OK

by Aline Rawland

Meeting last night, CSL decided
iavorably on a policy to allow dogs
in oft-campus housing on a one
year trial basis.

The main arguments against the
policy were voiced by the non
student members of the com»
mittee, Director oi the Physical
Plant Dale Hawn, ViceProvost
Kenneth Browning, proiessor
Liahna Babener and Tederman,

They each cited problems
connected with dogs running loose
on campus and in the dining halls,
as well as previous problems with
destruction to the houses and
furniture caused by dogs.

Aside train the damage problem.
they also pointed out that a few
years ago, when dogs were allowed
anywhere on campus, the animals
iormed packs, knocking down
children and rummaging through
garbage cans,

The oil-campus group, led by
sophomore Pat Walsh, proposed a
seli—eniorcement plan to take care
of these problems. The group
claims that each dog owner Will be
required to put in time as a “dog
catcherrcompiaint handler." to
relieve Student Affairs of the
burdens they laced the last time
dogs were allowed on campus,

Members or the group also
pointed out that the last time dogs
were allowed on campus. students
in the dorms could also own the
animals, which meant a larger
number of dogs.

Their proposal limits the number
of dogs to two per house and
requires the unanimous consent at
everyone in the house beiore a
person may get a dog. With 18
collegeowned houses, there can be
a maximum at 36 dogs.

“The present policy isn't en~
icrccubic, and students ignore it
anyway." says Walsh, “50 why not
give us a chance to govern our
selves.”

CSL also defeated a new cat
policy calling tor designated cat
floors to eliminate the problem
most pet owners have of not
knowing whether or not they may
bring a pet with them at the
beginning oi the year,

The policy will remain as it was
in the past.

They also considered stronger
lines for the abuse 0|" animals or
the misconduct of an animal.

group’s sentiment when she said,
“The present policy is inadequte
and there is trouble controlling the
situation, At the end 0i last year I
saw many stray cats near my
home. I also heard of one incident
where a cat was left for five days in
a room without water. I’d like to
see certain requisites established
So We won’t have this abuse."

One of the members of the Pet
Board who brought the proposal,
senior Cynthia Wolpert, said. “I
think with pet floors we would
stress responsible pet ownership.
They would encourage people to
complain about abuse instead of
just voting against cats at the
beginning of the next semester."

The committee decided to table
action on a proposed rules change
that outlines a method for
removing CSL members.

Sponsors oi the proposal, senior
Rob Henak and SGA President
Greg Youtz, claim Turner found
the guidelines presently written in
the new constitution unr
satisfactory. causing him to reject
the entire document last year.

The method suggested last night
would give each body with
representatives on CSL the right to
remove its representatives ii
Serious conﬂicts arose. i.e, the
failure oi a CSL member to support
the position of the body he or she
represents. Under the new policy,
Joint Board would need a two
thirds vote to remove a
representative, ‘

Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman strongly opposes the
proposal under the assumption
that it would Cause students on the
committee to tear reprisals trom
Joint Board.

“I think that it (the policy) puts a
lot at pressure on students." he
said, ”which would cause single
issue politlcs where the studens
would just vote as a block instead

of making their own decisions."

“That's l'airly absurd,” said
Youtz of Tederman's remarks.
“Last year when there was a
strong sentiment for removing
several members of the com-
mittee, barely a majority voted tor
a removal of one member, while
two others didn't even come close
to having a majority against
them,”

Because CSL is the most
powerful committee on campus,
Youtz and l-lenak [eel that Joint
Board should at least have the
right to remove students since the
students should be acting in the
interest oi the campus,

Youtz explained that the need for
a new policy developed last year
when several students on the CSL
were perceived by Joint Board to
be voting against Joint Board and
the general student body on im-
portant issues such as bathroom
policy, dogs and off-campus
housing, and alcohol policy,
