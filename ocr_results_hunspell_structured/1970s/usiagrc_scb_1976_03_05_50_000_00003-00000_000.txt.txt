.Need for
exchange

There is a serious lack oi coma
munication between the various
student government organizations.

line administration, and the student
body. in order to alleviate this

problem, i feel that there must be a
better means oi disseminating
information from SGA to the

,students and irom the students to

SGA, lniormation concerning
future times, places and agendas
oi Joint Board and campus cums
mittee meetings must be available
in the Memo, post oiiice and the
individual halls. There also exists a
need ior SGA to report regularly on
its actions.

Once students receive this in.
formation, SGA must actively seek
student opinions by encouraging

indent attendance at all meetings,
soliciting student comments, and
insuring that SGA representatives
eriorm their jobs. Through this
gxchange oi iniormation, SGA will
cease to be isolated from the
student body and become a more
representative iorm oi govern-
merit.
in addition, communication
must be improved between the
administration, SGA and the
student body. Students’ rights in
this area have been sadly ignored
As a member oi the Food and
Facilities Committee, I was deeply
angered and amazed when the
administration conceded that they
did not trust the students enough to

‘let them in” on the iact that
negotiations were in progress.
Students have the right to know
and participate in the decision-
,making process. They need a

ﬁtudent government that will
actively right ior student rights
and elicit support irom the student
body in achieving these aims.

i believe that i can be an ei-
tective vice»president by im-
proving these channels oi com
munication, which will lead to

¢ greater studentparticipation in the
decisionmaking process oi the
college.

Reflect
attitudes

Let's not kid ourselves about the
prospects oi a dynamic student
government ior the next year. The
potential is all too great ior SGA to
repeat its past periormance as the
means to express student opinion.

But this is not entirely SGA’s
fault its existing structure is

rather Wellcsilited for hearing '

complaints and attempting to act
on them, It also has a substantial
budget authority which has a
direct impact on many aspects of
Student life. Yet most Students, at
best, are vaguely aware as to how
SGA operates or what it operates
on. This in turn permits SGA to
function relatively oblivious to
prevailing campus mood.

Personally, I cannot blame most
students for feeling that SGA does
not do anything, Possibly the most
realistic people here are those that
do not vote. In all of its grand
design and schemes our student
government has been unable to
react to the off-campus policy and
Saga decisions by the
ministration. Most likely more of
the same type oi ‘unexpected’
decisions will occur.

The vice presidency offers the
opportunity ior me to begin to
reverse son's negative conduct.
Primarily, I want to see SGA
devoting itseli to responding to all
types of student input—even ii the
administration does not respond to
SGA. SGA’s iirst priority lies with
student interest. I would make it
my responsibility to see that SGA
takes the initiative in investigating
all potential problems In campus
life, Speciﬁcally. this means that
the budgets priorities must he
constantly under review, that the
EPCS and the Joint Board take an
active role 1“ monitoring academic
life, and that. other nonracademic
aspects of Grinnell become a real
concern for SGA.

SGA'S efforts in these areas have
not been overly commendable. li
elected, I will prove that student
government has the capacity to at
least reflect the attitudes of the
student body to whoever is
listening.

As a candidate in the election for ,,.

the vice-presidency of SGA, I am s

hoping for your vote. I do not think
there are any real issues in the
upcoming election. instead 1 think
issues at Grinnell pop up quickly
and are often decided with little
student input. , ‘ ,
‘ As vice president I would hope to
uncover issues while they are in
the planning stages of develop-
ment, When an issue develops I
plan to react. This reaction would
oiten be in the torm oi getting
student input. I hope to delay the
decision process until sufficient
input is attained.

One way i plan to accomplish
this is by getting first hand reports
from the Various committees on
campus. With the SGA president, I
would hope to find out what the
administration of the College is
planning. ‘

in order to be a good vice-
president it is important to put a
great deal of time into the office.
For the next two semesters at
Grinnell 1 would take 12 Credits
each, ii elected. I would make up
my credits in a ninth semester at
Grinnell. By taking the 12 credits a
semester I am sure that I will have
the time to put in What the office
requires.

informal Contact with students is
the best way for getting students'
thoughts and views at. Grinnell. It
is my hope for students at Grinnell
to iirst consider me a student, and
then a vice president. in this way. i
hope to overcome the
“elitism" that has been a problem
to past administrators of SGA.

In conclusion, I will discuss my
qualiﬁcations and campaign
philosophy. I have been a loose

year and have served two years as
a students’ rights advocate on the

Committee. In my campaign 1 will

Kicks for
efficiency

Student government at Grinnell
needs a kick in the pants. As vice
president, I feel I can administer
those kicks swiitly and deftly. By
making the Cabinet and Joint
Board more eiiicient, through
tightening up their organizational
and administrative laxity, meeting

’ time could be spent in productive-
' decision-making and initiating

action, This would make student
government a more vital in.
strument in voicing student con-
cerns‘one with which the ad-
ministration would have to con-
tend.

Because the vice president is
elected independently of the
president, I would be able to
operate as a viable iorce on both
the Cabinet and Joint Board
distinct from the president. In
addition, the vice president has the
responsibility ior the iunctioning oi
the campus judicial system.

It is precisely in these areas that
I can boot the best. I have acquired
administrative and organizational
skills in the areas of finance.
legislation, personnel, and policy
making after serving [our years on
a nationally elected committee for
the United Methodist Church. I feel
i can apply these skills to the
problems faced by SGA. I have
also acquired a firsthand
knowledge oi the campus judicial
system after having served in the
Office oi Community Rights in the
active 1974-75 year, and feel Con-
fident in my abilities in this area.

Please vote March 9th toward
making student government alive
and kicking.

Progress
forward

With the excitement and color of
the SGA presidential election
behind us, it is now time to look
forward to another annual historic
event in a year of Grinnell, the SGA
vice»presidential election, Ah, but
What Grinnell wouldn't do ior a
nenry Kissinger.

Next year will not be a historic
year ior Grinnell, it will probably
be just like any other year.
(Unless, of course, our new
sidewalk system is installed.) But,
as always, the school attempB to
iorge ahead and many timu
regresses instead oi progresses.
The purpose of SGA is to assist the
school progress in a forward
direction. .As it is, one can never
condemn the SGA for failing, as
long as it tries. But has it tried?
This year the only amendments
passed were those amending the
SGA constitution regarding itself,
and the {logging oi one of its own
members. 1 guess its the
Watergate purge trend, But, they
try. and I give them credit,
Hopefully, though, next year's
group can try harder,

It's a vicious circle. The SGA has
no power, so the students don’t
care, and the less they care, the
less power the SGA has, The
ilexing of SGA’S muscles should
include a voice (strong voice) in
curriculum matters, i,e. course
requirements and distribution of
money. housing (do you enjoy
living in the dorms'! 7, food service,
and admittance. After all, you
have to live with next year's fresh»
men,

These ideas are good for the
whole campus. I think that with the

. proper support we can improve the

position of the student body to the

-one position of respect it deserves

from the administration.
