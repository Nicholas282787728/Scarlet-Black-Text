Mondale For President?

. by Frank Smith
\ AMES, lA»When walter Mondale
won re-election with the largest

number of votes ever cast tor a
candidate in Minnesota, it seemed
inevitable that people would begin
to speak ol him as it he might run
tor president.

The Senator crops up on Sunday
interview programs and into the
pages ol newspapers. And Walter
Mondale is turning up in place alter
place to give speeches tor lund and

morale raising dinners for Demo-
crats. Last Saturday evening, lowa
Democrats took their turn to host
the Senator from Minnesota. All the

Opolitical stars in attendance manag-
ed to insert some note about the
presidential possibilities of a Wal-
ter Mondale.

All. of these things would lead
most people to snap their lingers
and cry “Aha! He is running ior
president!,” hopeful that they’ve
stumbled on to some prophetic idea
that will allow them to brag about

their political foresight and genius
in years to come But Mondale is
.one step ahead of them: “Of course
I’m talking to people around the
country about it. I’m in a prelim-
inary stage." of course.
What’s impressive about Mondale7
People like to be told that a po-
tential president is ”impressive"

and then conjur up a list oiqualir
ties that any ”impressive” man

must possess: height, build, rugged
good looks, piercing eyes, states—

manlike hair, particular nose, and
on and on. rm sure that to get that
man we would have to construct
him lrom scratch and then what

We'd have would resemble a cross
between George Washington, Abrar
ham Lincoln, and Geronimo. Mon—
dale is none of these but resembles
a stock broker or a high school
principal (Harold Hughes used to
drive trucks).

N0. Mondale breaks the rules and
just looks average, and his voice
isn’t even fiery or spiritually move
ing. l-lis Minnesota drawl (excuse
the regionalism) twangs across the

one line jokes so well that I was
sure that comedy was his calling.
(“Richard Nixon has done for pols
iticians what the Boston Strangler
did for doorriordoor salesmen.”)
Even when he's driving home a
point i was only impressed with
the assarmatter-of-fact authority
he possesses.

Perhaps he doesn’t look the pres-
ident because it's so early in the
campaign. What is impressive is
his record, He has consistently
taught to retain and strengthen a
welfare system that tries to avoid
making scapegoats or victims of
those for whom American unwitt-
ingly fails to provtde an equal
chance. The issues of housing, ader
quaie nutrition and education, all
of which seem very distant in these
Nixon days at scandal and crisis,

this in the morning or that I will
find a burning Star or David on my
doorstep. but this must be said.
Several days ago when Golda Meir
made her first visit to America to
talk to Mr. Nixon about the peace
he was pressing her for, she made
a Striking picture, She sat there‘
talking about how lriendly America
was to her country, yet it took no
great feat of visualization to see
.the knives in her back protruding
through her front. The fact was so
clear that America would be the

ctically any country foolish enough
to ally itsell to her.

Look at lsrael, then look at Ford
Motor Company, Chrysler, General
Motors and American Motors. These
people are making money lrom mak-
ing automobiles with internal com-

gbustlon engines. These engines are
insulticient, dirty and use a source
at power that was known to be ex
haustable, Now this source olpower
is practically exhausted when com-
pared to the degree which it isused,

Look at Mobil, Gull oil, Standard,

et. al. They all have millions sunk
in the idea ol petroleum as power.
They seem as eager to introduce
a new type of power which would
cut their petroleum sales as the
automobile industry is to retool
and start selling a new type ol
engine. America, it seems, will
have perpetual luel problems.

Until the Alaskan Pipeline is fine
ished and the rape ol the Artic
is begun, then America will grow
more and more dependent on Russ
sian and Arabian Sources. This
causes difficulties Arabia already
supplies 80% pl Europe’s oil and
practically all of Japan’s oil.

The refusal of the Arabs to sell
oil forced America to stretch her
already elongated luel reserves in-
tensely, The entire Sixth Mediterr-
anean Fleet, Which traditionally
fuels in Italy. now must haveAmer-
ican fuel brought in because, were
the Italians to fuel Americans with
Palestinian Oil, they would soon find
their tanks bone dry.

The situation is that America,
each year, increases the delicit by
making demands that are unrealis-
tic in comparison to their needs.
This will soon make us dependent
on Russia and Palestine for our
oil. Alaskan pipeline or not. When
that day comes, the Arabs can cite
terminate Israel without moving a
troop, warming an engine, or firing
a shot.

No matter how far superior IS-
rael’s Armed Might may be, it will
be of no avail. Oil in the right hands
is a weapon that makes the atom
bomb pale tc insignificant. Israel
shall fall and we will have no time
for tears for we will be next.

still matter to Walter Mondale.
"We have important national prir
orities to move on to.” he said,
“and we’ve got to get this Waters
gate thing resolved fully so that we
can move on.”

Mondale is a man appealing to a

party that desperately wants to hear
some kind of a appeal,

“Democrats lose elections, Repubr
licans don’t win them, We have to
discover the dillerence as a party
between debating and carrying our
debates to a suicidal level where
Richard Nixon: and Ronald Reagans
can get into office.“

Whether the Democratic party is
sobered enough to take need of the
lessons of 1972 is doubtful in these
lazy-Watergaterdays when Demo.
crats don’t even have to be so
crass as to have to rub their hands
together when they gloat. ButDemo-

crats can lose again and Mondale
makes clear that the country loses
because of the fundamental policies
characteristic of Republicanism.

Quoting from Harry Trumanin I948.

Mondale points out that things have—

n’t changed all that much.

"The Republicans are forthehome
but not for housing. The Republicans

are tor a minimum wage,the smalls
er the minimum the better. And the
Republicans admire the government
so much that they’d like to buy it.”

Whether Walter Mondale can ass-
ess and expound the American sit-
uation in a way that brings him the
presidential chair is almost a silly
question three years lrom the elec-
tion. Butthe Americanpeople,weary

from a government of deceit “has
an enormous desire for decency
and Social justice, with leader-
ship worthy ol that decency."

Perhaps it isn't too early to be
running for president. The revela-
tions of the past year have been
minor in comparison to the pain
so many of us felt over the defeat
of George McGovern. Was it an
echo in the hall when Mondale Said
that “it is better that we live with
the occasional laults of a govern-
ment living in the spititoi' charity
than with a government frozen in
the ice of its own indifference.”

IN P-l/lr

 

by lra Aronin

It is not often these days that a
truly outstanding band comes along
which includes subtlety as one of
their ingredients. Premiata For-
neria Marconi are one such band,
Named after a small, obscure bak-
ery, PFM is a five man Italian rock
hand currently being produced by
and touring with Pete Sinfleld, exs
at King Crimson.

Here-to-lore, the PFM album, en—
titled “Photos of Ghosts” has been
only mildly successful,hoveringar-
ound 190 on the Billboard charts,
but after the band tours the States
in January, I am sure that their
popularity will increase at least
several fold.

Fusing the subtle delicacies of cl»
asslcal music with the whining, po—
unding sounds of rock is no easy
manner, but PFM do it beautfi»
fully. Featuring Flavio Premoli on
keyboards it vocals, Franz Di Cior
ccio on drums and vocals, Glﬂl‘gr
lo Piazza on bass, Franco Mussida
on guitars and vocals, and Mauro
Pagaini on violin and woodwind, the|
hand contains five of Italy’s finest
rock musicians. Premoli is partic—
ularly outstanding on keyboards.
His work is so fine on the album
that I would have to consider him
one of the finest in classical rock
keyboards, right upwithWakemanof
Yes and Keith Emerson of ELP.

Unlike Emerson however, Premoli
does not ﬂaunt his work; hedoesnot
run the scales merely so we can
hear how last his lingers move, but
rather shows us how his head moves
his hands through some of the most
beautiful thoughtful keyboard. and
especially synthesiser work avail»
able today. He rarely hogs the st-

 

I/l/

age, and when he does it is for the
rocker ol the album, a song relea-
sed in Britain as a single and en-
titled “Celebration.” "

Piazza on bass and Musslds on
guitar are also outstanding. on the
opening cut, “River ol Life.” I
find mysell waiting, rather than as
is customary, for some lead Solo
or a keyboard rill, for Piazza’s
bass. He does not play loudly-just
a gentle rolling in the background,
but his playing is again, intelligent
and excellent. Mussida’s work on
lead also fits this description-there
are few, almost none actually, elec-
tric lead solos on the album, more
often than not Mussida is involved
with acoustic work and it is fine,
especially on “River of Life."

Pagani, on violin, is best heard
on the title cut, “PhotosothOStS.”
and he too is excellent. though not
perhaps as creative as the rest of
the band.

Sinlield wrote the English lyrics
for the album, since the band does
not speak English, and retracked
the vocals by the use of phonetics.
They still come across beautilully,
and one can see clearly, on "ll
Banchetto," a song sung in Italian,
that the band has not only outstand-
ing instrumental, but also 'vocal
abilities,

The overall sound of the band is
unique, ﬂavored here and there with
a taste of Yes, or perhaps King
Crimson. but delinitely a unique
sound. PFM are on American tour
in January as I said earlier. and
it at all possible I would encourr
age that all efforts be madetowards
Manitcore Records in obtaining the
band for a concert here They are
outstanding.

WATS Service Possible

Nailonll On Campus Report

TUCSON, AZ--Student government
leaders are continuing their battle
with the American Telephone and
Telegraph Company to allow Univ—
ersity of Arizona students unlim-
ited access to campus WATS lines.
Chris Reece. ExecutiveVice Pres—
ident of the Associated Students of
the University of Arizona (ASUA)
has filed a revised complaint in
response to a Federal Communicar
tions Commission ruling that the
ASUA is ineligible for the flat-fee
telephone service.

Under the revised plan, ASUA would
obtain eight WATS lines and allow
all members of the student body
unlimited access to them, Students
would be charged 25C for a five
minute call anywhere in the nation,

Reece feels that there are at least
three ways his idea might become
a reality.

First, his revised complaint may
he accepted by the FCC? Reece
disagrees that the intital FCC inter—
pretation ol the telephone company
tariff rule which states, ”No phone
Call may be made on a WATS line
that is not Within the direct ins
terest of the purchaser" prohibits
his plan.

Second, the tariff itsell may be re»
vised. Although it rejected the ini-
tial ASUA application, the FCC noted
that the tariff is unreasonable and
sent it to a trial board for review
and possible revision.

Finally, an entirely new telephone
rate may be established as a res-
ult of Reece’s original petition.
Officials from A T ill. T headquar-
