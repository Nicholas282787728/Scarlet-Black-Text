What is Public Interest?

I think that “the public Interest”
as carved on stone tablets, is a
myth. The real difference between
the so—called public Interest and
private interests is a quantitative
one, something along the lines oithe
greatest good tor the greatest num-
ber.

During some testimony lpresented
belore a public hearing held by the
Iowa Air Quality Commission, I
pronounced, “Where the public
health and weliare and Where the
public interest is (it stake. .thei‘e
is not place tor special interest
environmental laws."
Horseieathers, In the recent bee!
boycott, cattlemen comprise one
vested interest, and consumers
comprise another, albeit a broader
one. It anything, the public interest
is the result oi a process whereby
all views on any issue have a rea-
sonable chance to be presented.

Objectivity on the part at “cru-
saders” like Ralph Nader is a myth
that need not even be dispelled. In
the above testimony, I made out as
it I was 100% In the right and the
corporate representatives totally
wrong. The proportion was more
like 70% to 30%, the point being
that total objectivity would not have
won my case,

Alinsky gives the illustration of
the Declaration oi Independence, a
onersided document if there ever
was one. How many volunteers could
have been mustered for the revolu-
tion, he asks, it the Declaration Said
they were only 75% right?

No Fat Accounts

Public interest research is not for
those who desire to iatten their
bank accounts, but it’s a great way
to avoid the post-graduate trauma!
For some, this might be a viable
long-term career alternative, Lib-
eral arts degrees, it nothing else,
give one practice in research tech-
niques,

Some Reservations

I have some reservations concern-
ing the Naderrtype philosophy of
social change through hand-aid meav

oi a protracted disease, supposed

arily staving off a Crisis which
would be less catastrophic were it

A case in point: urban air pollu-

tion. Assume no environmentally
sponsored pollution controls are in
existence. One spring day, a freak
air inversion traps a layer at smog
over New York and 100,000 people
hit the pavement.

Might not this have it greater
potential at lbrcing our society to
examine the basic societal values
which cause pollution than all the
testimony trcm a world or posy-
plucking environmentalists?

Ultimate Horrible

Horrible Explained

by Scott Weii

For almost a month now I have been writing this column under the title,
“The Ultimate Horrible.” it seems now very appropriate for me to ex»
plain what the title means and its implications.

“The Ultimate Horrible” is a descriptive phrase which was lirst used
by a member at the laculty of this college in l'eiei‘ence to student parti-
cipatioli in iaculty personnel decisions, I have broadened the name at
reierence to include all aspects ol student power In academic decision
making at the upper levels or importance at this College.
it is my opinion that a great majority olotll'laculty is plagued by the
paranoia at said “Ultimate Horrible ” The articulated reason given by
iaculty members against a joint studentrlaculty ellort in government is
that the taculty have had more experience and have more expertise in

matters of academic concern
on Monday afternoon the faculty voted to eliminate Divisional EPC’S.

The iustiiicatiomgiven ior this move was that the oiVisional EPC’s
were lneiiicient in tuliilling their duties, coordinating and balancing
the departments within the division as well as representing the departs
ments within the division to the Alerampus EPC, In place or the divisional
EPC’s it was suggested that the tacuity members bin division consult
with the designated iacuity representative at the division on all matters
oi academic concern.

The signilicancc or this action can not he over—cinphnsizcd Here isa
blatant example or the iacully choosing to ignore the views oi the students
at this college, Many students expressed incredlllily over the lact that
students were not consulted with on the matter cl abolishing a student
taculty committee The meaning cl this move by the lacultv points out
that we students have no legal standing in the academic governance at
this college. ’l‘wentyrone laculty members stripped the students ot our
second highest level at representation,

1 am committed to bringing about innovative academic i-cioriii to this
college and thus reraiili‘mlng the bellet that this college is committed
to progressive education 1 can not do this. however, when my constituency
is treated as invisible Men and Women by the l-esl or the College
Community Until the value or our existence on this campus is recognized
by the iacully, SGA is doomed to irustrated hopes and cynical ciiticism
The students otcrinnellai-c demanding the right to be seen and are appalled
by a system which only lostei-s irustration and criticism
