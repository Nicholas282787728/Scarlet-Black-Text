Debate at Grinnell is back,
More precisely, John Nelson,
Chris Nylander, Elliot Pollock and
Jane St. Clair are competing in

individual speech events in
forensics competition. Classic
college debating takes place
during the fall semester and
speech competition in the spring.

The campus debate team
collapsed six years ago when the
communications department was
cut and the team's coach left
Grinnell. No one has tried to revive
the team until now. St. Clair and
Nelson. both debaters in high
school. started toying with the idea
last fall. and this January the team
was created

A RANGE or events occur at
American Forensic Association

,Association tNFAt. and Iowa Inr

Extemporaneous speaking
allows contestants a hall hour to
prepare a talk on a topic which
they have drawn. Topics are
usually public issues. but can vary
greatly,

compe einl is eventas well as the
impromptu speech category, in
which contestants are allowed no
preparation time and must simply
lorm their speeches while
speaking. This is Nelson‘s personal
favorite, He says “it's not unheard
oi for people to be asked to talk
about onions "

ln alter-dinner speaking, Elliot
Pollock’s event. laughs are the
object during the delivery of a pre-
writtcn humorous monologue it's
supposed to have a topic, not just
an eight minute string of one

radio broadcasting.

on \Tl()i'\' IS ALSO a [are
written speech, though more
serious and on a specific issue. St.
Clair said she talks about toys. and.
how they ,affect, children’s

 

imaginations.

The judges who determine the
winners at speech tournaments are
volunteers, No lormal training is
required to be a judge. Most have
had debating and-or coaching
experience, or are students in
graduate school, The colleges
sponsoring tournaments provide
these judges. Judging decisions in
the above four events are based
hall on the content of the speech
and ball on oral performance, says
St. Clair.

NO ONE PRESENTLY on the
Grinnell team competes in the
other speech events: dramatic
interpretation involving a per-
formance otan excerpt from a play
and prose and poetry in
lerpretatlon. Judging is based here
entirely on the expression and style

The Grinnell team competes in
Region lv of the AFA against
approximately 30 schools, some as
large as the University of Iowa and
some smaller |han Grinnell,
Tournaments normally run from
Friday afternoon to Saturday af-
ternoon with about 20 schools
competing

THE TEAM llAS gone to two
tournaments so far, one a state
meet at Simpson College in In

Clair placed fifth in oration and
Nelson third in cxtemporaneous

Considering their late start and
little experlence, the four have
done very well. Llahna Babencr,
their faculty advisor, has had
coaching and debating experience.
The team hopes she will be their
full-time coach next year. They
would also like to host a tour-
nament here. They hope to enter

‘Film classics offer variety

by Robin Radcspiel

This Week's film calendar offers
a sampling from a variety of tilm
genres with a John Ford epic, a
Fellini montage. and ﬂ Hitchcock
thriller. Each film is an out:
standing example at its respective
genre and all three are worth
seeing ‘

John Ford: Classic film The
Grapes oi u‘i-atli 11940, 115 mins,)
vividly depicts the flight ot
thousands of mldwesterners to
California in the 1530:, Searching
for a better life. To his credit, Ford
closely follows the Steinbeck novel
in dialogue and plot action, thereby
retaining the powerful realism that
made the novel famous

LIKE THE MW 1.. the film
centers on lthoad family who flee
the dust bowl of Oklahoma to make
a new life in the “land
of milk and h0ney”~California.
The Joads slowly learn that their
liopes'for the tuiure arc merely
dreams hésed'upon lies, and that
California holds nothing for them
except poverty, homelessness, and
exploitation Nevertheless, the
tamily survives with strength and
dignity, {or as Ma Joad says, they
are “the people."

Ford captures the lives oi these
people with great sensitivity and
honest realism, His efforts are
enhanced by a fine Cast which
includes Henry Fonda, Jane
Darwell. and John Carradine.
Prior to each showmg of the film, a
documentary dealing with rural
life in the 19305 will be seen. Friday
night, The Plow that Broke the
Plains and Sunday night The
River will be shown.

'iminsJ is radically different from
the John Ford classic, for here the
significance of the film lies in its

teams of two debate the pros and
cons of a single topic all season,
next fall as 1 well as the individual
events in the spring,

ST. CLAIR SAYS tournamenm
give her a chance “to get out of
Grinnell” for a different kind or
weekend. Though they compete
against schools with well-equipped
speech departments, Pollock
thinks Grinnell can and will
compete comparably. Nelson goes
so far as to say that because of
their ability, the team “should
have no trouble dominating the
state," _

They stressed that anybody
with or without experience is
welcome to join the team or just
find out more about it, All you need
is some quick thinking. and
possibly courage, they say.

artistic qualities rather than its
message.

Ferderico Fellini calls his film
simply “the story of a city," but as
we watch we see that it is much
more than that. Fellini not only
presents Rome, he explores his
own memory's lantasies about the
citv. Scenes range from a brothel
with large-breasted women
barking out lnvltations. to a papal
iashlon Show with nuns and priests
modeling the latest in church garb.

Fellini captures the energy and
exuberance of the City and its
people in the beauty and richness
of the film Fellini’s Rania is a {me

This week‘s Hitchcock con-
tribution is Dial M For Murder
ll953. 88 mins.), a faslrpaced
thriller starring Ray Milland and
Grace Kelly. The iilm, based upon
the Frederic} Knot’s play, in many

ways seems to pick up where
Strangers on a Train tlast week’s
lilmt left off.

iormer tennis champion Tony
Wendice lMlllandl and his wealthy
Wife Margo (Kelly), whose at
tentions toward another man
tRobert Cummings) anger her
husband, Wishing to inherit
Margo‘s fortune, Wendice plans
the perlect murder to dispose of
her, He blackmails a former
criminal into Committing the deed
for him but the situation takes a
trightening turn when Margo
thwarts her attacker, and in doing
so, murders him.

Hitchcock masterfully creates
suspense and tension in this
relatively Short film vtith the use of
quick crosscuttings crisp
dialogue, and by implicating the
audience in the action through
camera angle and perspective
Furthermore, he rarely takes the
camera out of the Wendice
apartment, lending a feeling of
claustrophobia and intensity to the
film.
