Trustees descend on campus

by non Flyiin

Several times a year they invade
the Grinnell campus Sometimes
their presence is very obvious:
other times they are hardly
noticed But whether they are
apparent or not, actions taken by
Grinnell's trustees have an impact
on present and future Grinnell
students.

The main duty of the board of
trustees, according to trustee
Elizabeth Ki‘mdenler, is “to hire
and fire the preSidenl " The board
sets policies concerning tinancial
matters and makes recomr
melidations to the administration
on long range planning. the
physical plant, and other aspects of
the college. Also, the board oi
trustees is legally responsible tor
the college

LAST WEEKL ‘D the trustees
once again descended on campus
While hcrc, lhcy mct with students
to get a tee] of what concerns
Grinncll students today. Students
brought up ideas ranging from
affirmative action policies to the
need tor more rules concerning the
loudness of Stereos,

“Student opinion is extremely
important.” asserts Fritz Maytag,
chairman of the board. Concerning
the college's investments in cor-
porations that have operations in
South Africa, Kruidenier feels.
“the students certainly had a great
innuence " Last year the board
appointed a member to monitor
questions concerning proxies, This
member reviews proxy cases and
makes recommendations about
how the college should vote on
controversial issues. “The
students' feelings were a large
factor in the board's action,” she
adds. However, Maytag believes
that the issue has not yet been
resolved, “I think we could do

more,” he states.

THE MAJOR PROBLEM facing
the college is the long-term
financial outlook. “We must have

running a college “seems to inflate
[aster than the cost of living.
Things look very. very bad for
colleges." The future possibility of
a dwtndling applicant pool is
another financial worry.

But Grinnell is for the most part
financially sound. “We’re in better
shape than many colleges tor two
big reasons," States Maytag.
“First, we have had a few ex-
traordinarily generous donors
Next, with that money. we've had
talented trustees making creative
investments ”

A COLLEGE. Maytag points out,
is ditterent trom any other cor-
poration "At a college," he starts
out. " on have to balance “hat
Dick ' rner calls the ‘liard' and
‘soft' assets," Hard assets Concern
capital and buildings~financial
matters, Soft assets are students,
faculty and the school's
reputation 7 intangibles,
“Neither.” he concludes, is more
important than the other "

“If the students aren't happy."
Maytag goes on, “you've lost the
college But the other factors. the
financial concerns. must also be
Considered ”

FINANCIAL PROBLI IS asidc,
Maytag is optimistic about the
state of the college. He has a ”very
positive feeling about all levels of
the Grinnell administration." He
also is conﬁdent about the quality
of students and faculty.

Grinnell is an “intriguing in-
stitution," remarks Maytag, "A
trustee is very aware of the fact
that he has been entrusted with the
college."

BOTH KRUIDENIER and
Maytag see the task in a similar
light, “It‘s tun. It‘s very in-
teresting,” he comments. Cour
cludes Kruidenier. “it's a labor of
love."

Incidents perplex authorities

tcontiniied trom page it

a lack of sensitivity on the part of
the campus community, par
ticularly males. “They don’t un
derstand what it's like to be
sexually threatened," she claims.
Jokes about the flasher do not
strike her as iunny, she adds “I
was really disturbed by the lack of
awareness on campus 1 think
the campus community should be
enraged "

However. the administration is
taking the problem quite seriously
Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman stresses that the
situation Is no Joke, If Someone is
caught exposing himself “it will be
treated as a crime "

"WE‘RE NO'I‘ responding like
it's a yoke" asserts Wittpenii “I
think it's irightening It's a little
perverted . there‘s a sick person
out there There's a potential tor
something more to happen" As
onc stiidcnt comments . you'rc
cornered standing in the shower.
Who‘s to say it wouldn't go any
furthci‘ "

Steps are licing taken to educate
people about the problem “We
want to sensitize both women and
men to the fact that this is
serious," states Wittpenn Recent
hall meetings have been part oi
this etiort One purpose of the
meetings is to “get people alert
and aware," according to RA
Barbara Gaddis Wittpenn notes
that some useful discussion has
taken place zit the meetings.

AWARENESS 0F TIIE problem
should go tar toward solving it,
most people think, One student
comments, “People assume that in
Grinnell. Iowa, this docsn'thappen

. . That’s bullshit This sort of
thing goes on allover. People must
realize that they don’t have to take
this sort oi thing" wittpcnn

‘Plepple shouldn‘t tolerate

RA Anne Claflin stresses that if
a person ieels threatened, she
should “call the police right at
terwards and give them the best
description she can ”

Wittpenn adds, “I’ve found the
police very understanding and
helpful.” She believes the flashers
may eventually be caught.

MANY ME. SURES can be
taken to solve t e problem.

At last Monday’s hall meeting in
l-laines. RA Rick Kaplan suggested
that it conironted, "yell your head
on " Most suggested that it it is
possible tollow the person or try to
detain him. but not it this appears
risky,

Tcderman suggests that people
be more questioning of strangers
on campus and in llte dorms. in
dividuals can inform other
membets of the floor when they
take a shower and check the
bathrooms heiore entering Halls
may vote for Z4~hour lockrups so
that strangers will not have access
to the floors Unfortunately, adds
’l'ederman. lhe campus is not

“security conscious.” Many people
do not lock their doors and few
tend to be suspicious of strangers.

According to Wittpenn, since the .
hall meetings have been held and
signs posted in the bathrooms,
incidents have been reported much
more quickly She feels that people
are now more aware of the
problem and are willing to do
something about it. This will go far
toward identiiying and capturing
the men, she believes.
