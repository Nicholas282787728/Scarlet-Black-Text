Censorship

Late in the first semester, Scarlet and
Blnck coverage of news events was intere
ruptcd when a series of troubles erupted
between 5&3 editor MichaelErandonand
E. K. Shaw, publisher of the Newton
Dlily News, which at that time printed
the 5&3. Shaw, who had become increar
singly offended at the use or language
in the son, removed an oiiensive ‘word
from an editorial of November 14 (the
word, said Brandon later, contained see
van letters and rhymed with "ducking")
and the next week blotted out several
words with a pen in an article which
described a recent issue of the Grinnell
underground newspaper, The Ptero-
dactyl.

Brandon, furious, wrote an editorialde-
nouncing Shaw, saying that

i am old enough to understand lhat c K
shaw is part eta system that is suppress
ing Pierndnctyl and underground papers
throughout the nation, and I'm old enough
to understand thal that system kills of!
the Lenny drum and will do itsuamnetlest
to snuit out anybody who strongly dissenls
front it

The afternoon oi" the second censored
issue. Brandon released a mimeograph
statement to the college containing the
uncensored versions of the articles and
announcing the refusal to continue work-
ing with the Daily News, evidently at
the same iimeyshaw decided to refuse
to continue printing the S513.

Not until two weeks later did Brandon
find another printer and publish a last
issue of the semester in early Decem-
ber. That issue, as might be expected.
contained several letters on the issue.
both pro and con the ShB's stand, One
lady trom town admonished the Sim,
suggesting that the editors should “stop
having tantrums when you get a no-no
from a responsible adult.”

The next semester two new editors
took over, Harry Fulton and Lloyd Ger-
son. The new pair was of a more con-
servative bent, and ran beneath the ﬂag
each week a quotation from Plato: “The
misuse or language is not only distaste»
ful in itself, it is even injurious to the
soul.”

Comp Requirement

in educational policy, the college face
ulty voted 62-14 in early November to
abolish the long-standing general rer
quirement that seniors mustpassacome
prehensive examination in their major
ﬁeld of study. Individual departments
were to provide for substitutes, such as
senior seminars, at their own discretion,

The issues or censorship, educational
policy, and the 8&0 strike, however,
were to pale to insigniticance near the
end oi the year as one giant concern"
the Vietnam wan-began to loom overall
else. President Nixon's invasion of Came
bodia and the killing of four Students at

Kent State caused Grinnell, like many ,

other schools, to erupt in protest and
eventually to close down two weeks
early. It is one of the most historic
chapters of Grinnell history.
Cambodia and Kent State

In April of 1970 President Nixon had
decided to use American troops to his
vade Cambodia, and the ensuing student
protest and political activism was (ira—
niatically highlighted on Monday; May 5,
when National Guardsmen in Ohio shot
four protesting students at Kent State
University. For the next two yveeks stur
dents at Grinnell and elsewhere were
preoccupied with political activism.

Called a special open meeting in Rob-
erts Theatre, Three hundred students
appeared and quickly adopted a proposal
to close the school for several days in
pl‘OteSt of the killings, and the faculty
held an emergency meeting at noon to
consider the hastily-drawn proposal. The
idea was accepted 71-6-9, and Grinnell
had for the first time take an institutional
stand on a political issue.

Citing the Cambodia and Kent State ins
cidenls, the resolution stated that "these
immoral acts...must be condemned, and
Grinnell College as an institution con'
demns them."

The school under that first resolution
was closed for the restoitheday‘Tuesday
and [or the duration of classes Wedr
nesday. An amendment by Political Sci
ience instructor Raymond Horton prOr
vided that representatives of the stur
dents, iaculty, and townspeople should
visit Washington to voice Grinnell’s stand
to government authorities.

Later in the day busloads of students
left for Des Moines to protest at the Caps
itol, and four hundred marched upon the
intersection of Park Street and Eighth
Avenue to take, over the ROTC building
and protest the presence of military
instructors on the campus. Four students
began a protest last in Herrick Chapel,
and collections began for an advertise—
ment voicing Grinnell’s stand to betaken
out in the New York Times.

The Thomas Proposal

, On Wednesday student meetings cons

tinned and President Leggett called
an all»college convocation for noon on
central campus. Andy LDer, SGA Pree
sident, observed during the convocation
that “if this institution is going to sure
vlve as a place for rational inquiry, it
must in the times ahead commit itself
to political action on all fronts,”
Hundreds of students in Roberts Thea-
tre continued debating proposals tor
more permanent action, meanwhile, and
classes Thursday and Friday were boy-
cotted by large numbers of students.
A plethora or proposals were offered
during the meetings, centering on ways of
implementing the closing oi the school,
but a proposal by senior Tom Thomas
embodying a compromise of several
other positions eventually came to the
lore. Thursday afternoon the Thomas
proposal received the endorsement of
approximately three-fourths of the 500
students present, and an opinion poll was
scheduled for noon on Friday to gauge
student opinion on the issue.
Final Action

The Thomas proposal received nearly
overwhelming endorsement irom the sine

dent hotly that day, and President Log—
gelt called an emergency facultymeeting
[or Friday alternoon to debate the issue
Leggett had, it turned out later, consulted
with members of the Board of Trustees
and wis going to recommend to the the
ulty that the school be closed early,

While students milled on the grass
outside the Science building, the iaculty
debated for 45 minutes the pros and cons
of the move, then called :in allecollege
meeting in Darby Gymnasium to announce
the decision,

Darby was packed President Leggett
and Dean Wall solemnly announced inthe
hustled stillliess that by a faculty vote
oi 91—4, the school would close its doors
on May 13, sixteen days before the schv
cduled commencement. Students would
have the option of taking credltrfall
grades in their courses or completing
them during the summer

Darby erupted as students and iaculty

alike leaped to their feet in a tumul<
tons applause. All began immediately
to work on the task at hand, and five
days later the campus was empty.

President Leggett noted in a letter
to parents several days later that “31,
most all students, from doctrinaire radr
icals to conservatives, have suddenly
become so politically involved that they
are no longer able to give properconcene
tratlon to their academic studies.”

”The existing atmosphere and [ems
per,” he added, ”make it almost imr
possible to continue the normal andtrade
itlonzil functions of the educational in-
stitutioh.”

And SO in turbulence, Confusion, and a
mixture of elation and somber aware-
ness of the historic nature of the move,
the year ended. Three months later, ina
different mood, we would come for our
sophomore year.

Sophomores: 1970-71

Atter a spring ol commitment and action
in causes at national concern, the campus
became inci'edsinglyconcerned with internal
issues, with the goals and structures of the
college itself

Throughout most of the first semester,
debates revolved specitically around grade
nation requirements, and the ettect which
any change lll requirements would have on
the quality and organization oi the college.

Beginning eaily in the year, it became
apparent that most iaculty saw the need
tor a major change in the requirement po-
licy, but not a total abolition of all require»
ments. Many issues, such as the freshman
adVising system, the balance between de-
partments and lelslons, the philosophy of
a liberal arts college, the focus ofa “Grim
nell Education" were hushed over and re-
hashed in interminable iaculty meetings,
with lagging interest and attendance as the
months Wore on,

Finally, in November, the requirement strr
ucture as we now see it was approved,
after an initial rejection of Beryl Clotfel-
ter’s “no requirements” plan and a ple-
thora of alternate plans and amendments.

AS a iootnote to the Great Requirements
Debate, the laculty also voted to abolish
physical education requirements, despite
pleas by son President Andy Loewi to the
contrary. l

Throughout the year, each department
was asked to evaluate and assess the effect
on total enrollment and on the sorts ofcour-
ses students were taking within the depart-
ment, Noticeable declines in enrollment
occurred in the toreign languages, introduc-
tory courses in music, art, the physical
sciences and some social sciences, and
an abrupt drop in the number oi freshmen

taking Humanities courses, Taken as a
whole, however, the eitects ot the restruc-
turing were not as great as had been pre—
dicted, with changes in registration owing
more to a simple change in the focus oi
student interest.

Bookstore .

Students returning to campus in the‘ fall
found a welcome addition in the expanded
bookstore iacilities, under a new manager,-
Tom McBee. With increasing enrollment
in independent projects requiring a variety
of sources, the bookstore offerings in non-
required literature have similarly in-
creased.

McBee also added records, cards, an
enormous variety ot school supplies and
room decorations to the bookstore stock.
The bookstore, along with the post office,
has become a near— daily stop for most
Grinnellians, tor buying, browsing or just
chatting,

Revolving Door

November 1970 saw the opening ola new
type of counseling center, the Revolving
Door. 50 volunteers, under the direction
at John Pfeffer, Jim Tederman, MarkShan~
strom and Ed Leong, underwent training
in drug and emotional counseling,

The center, manned by two volunteers, ‘
was available, either by telephone or per-
sonally for students with problems or who
just wanted someone to talk to. originally
open for 4 hours a night, the Revolving
Door increased its hours throughout the
year, operating nearly full time during
finals,

The founders of the Revolving Door wanted
to emphasize the fact that it was not speci»
fically a ‘crisis’ center, but served as a
