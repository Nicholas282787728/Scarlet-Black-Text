Men’s b-ball season comes to a close

by Alan loud

The men’s basketball team
finished their season with a 4717
record after losing to Lake Forest
at Darby Gymnasium Saturday,
Feb. 24, 52-54.

The game was won on the
defensive boards, as Lake Forest
was able to pull down rebounds and
get the ball dawn court on the last
break, The man to man defense,
which the Pioneers encountered,
prevented them from getting the
ball inside the key, and Lake
Forest Carried a 30-25 lead at the
hall. Grrnnell stayed close
throughout the game, and was able
to hit quite well from thaoutside

THE DISAPPDINTING 1055 had
little effect on the fans, as the
Pioneers had the largest turnout of
the season. “1 was very pleased
with the student support at the
ballgames.” Coach Peterson said
“ll makes a dilierence when you
play at home whether you have a
group of actively supportive ians.
or a small group We had a lot of
tans Vlrlio actively supported us.
and helped us play up to our
potential."

The three goals set by the team
at the beginning of the season
were: to play up to 85 per cent of
their potential. to filiish with a 500
season. and to have fun playing the
game at the same time ’

ALTHOUGH THE TEAM failed
it) post a 500 season, Peterson feels
that they did achieve the other two
goals. “I think that you should
gauge a season by how well you
play up to your potential.” he said

Peterson stressed the team
concept» throughout the year
“There iias a much stronger team
altitude; that's why we were
successful in one of our goals," he
said. referring to players per
forming up to their potential

ON rm: GOAL of having lun
playing the games: senior Charlie
Gogol said, “i was really satisfied.
We had a lot of Mn. l was satisfied
everyone stayed together and kept
at it. they didn't give up,"

' Looking back on the season,

Peterson felt that the team could
have had a 9713 record with a few
extra points in some games.
"PEOPLE DON'T realize Ule
difficulty of having a month off in
the middle of the season,” he said
“The people who play basketball

have to be commended because it's
a long, hard, demanding season."

Peterson summed up by stating,
“I can honestly say that there was
not a man out on the basketball
team that I did not feel a warmth
and affection towards."

loss to Lake Forest last Saturday in Darby. The game
marked the finale of the season, and left the team with a Jr
