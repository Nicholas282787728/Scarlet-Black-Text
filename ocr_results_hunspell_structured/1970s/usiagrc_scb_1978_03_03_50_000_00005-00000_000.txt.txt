“Swat the Gadﬂy”

If you. like me, were one of th
many latent campus
revolutionaries who rejoiced at the
appearance of the Gadiiy as an
alternative point of view to the
racist, sexist ruling-class rag 5&3.
beware! Try to restrain your enr
thusiasm [or the coming struggle
because, comrades, we have been
deceived.

Yes, once again the capitalist
exploiters have put one over on the
proletariat and its right-thinking
intellectual allies. The Gadfly is
not the Voice of the revolution but
instead a clever ruse perpetrated
by the bourgeoisie to quell the class
struggle and lull us lighters for
truth and justice into inaction.

WHILE we radicals breathe a
sigh of relief that there is finally a
forum for our views, the im-
perialist bourgeois lackeys of the
administration, the SGA, the 5&3,
and yes, comrades, the Godfly are
secretly subverting the revolution
from within so that their insidious
process of co-opting young minds
into the oppressive capitalist
system can continue unabate tis
all a part of the bourgeoisie’s
carefully orchestrated, sinister
plot which only careful scrutiny on
mv part was able to detect.

I MUST give my grudgingad-
miration to the class enemies of the
proletariat, however, for the
Gadfly was a clever fake.
Nevertheless, the unmistakeable
signs of decadent bourgeois
ideology in this affront to the
working classes are quite evident,
First of all, the paper was printed
on tawdry yellow newsprint, in
stead of revolutionary red n'ce
paper or even pink crepe, This was
a small error but a crucial one,
capitalist pigs!

THE NEXT cataract on
this yellow river of capitalist
deception was the quotation of the
reactionary bourgeois philosopher
Socrates, who went to his death

willingly rather than condemn the
oppressive laws of his state. Fur-
thermore, the entire publication
smacks of lily ivered bourgeois
sensibil es in its cursory use of
fourrletter Words like [Wk and s--t.
Sure, “irked up” and “s--ks" are
thrown in for appearances’ sake,
but a true revolutionary journal
would employ honest proletarian
descriptions of bodily functions,
and thus the Gadfly's lack of
profanity is a sure sign of its basic
capitalist orientation,

But the most damning evidence
of the Gadﬂy's status as an in-
strument of ruling class oppression
is only partly contained within its
pages, The GadIly claims that it is
run entirely on donations and that
it advocates going outside the
“proper channels“ to achieve
action, All very well and good,
comrades, but Where did the
Gadfly receive its “donations" for
the first issue? From none other
than that proper channel
bourgeois establishment, the SGA!

ONLY A true tool of capitalist

oppression would accept such
tainted money wrung from the
sweat and blood of exploited
workers and act "I such a
hypocritical and deceitful manner.
No red-blooded revolutionary
would dare have anything at all to

do with such notorious enemies of ,
the masses, This, comrades, shows ll

the true colors of the Gadl‘ly: not
radical red, not urine yellow. but
capitalist green!

This conclusive proof of the
Gndfly's control by the bourgeois
oppressors naturally casts doubt
on the true identity of its con»
tributors, If such people as ”Jim
Stuart” and “Rhonda West” really
exist, they are doubtless being held
hostage in some capitalist prison
while articles bearing their names
are being written by such noted
reactionaries as the 5&8 editors,
whose dedication to preserving the
exploitative bourgeois capitalist
system is well known. The same
secret ruling class which governs
the SM} and the SGA must cer~
tainly control the Gadily as well.

But comrades, will we allow this
travesty to Continue? Will we allow
the revolution to be co-opted and

suppressed in this manner? No! '

We must spur ourselves to action
and rise up to defeat the bourgeois
oppressors. It is our responsibility,
comrades, to curb the imperialist
running dogs, slaughter the
capitalist pigs, and swat the

Open Space

by Wes Kennedy
and
George Turnbull

The question of nuclear power is
now striking very close to home for
Grinnell students. The Iowa Power
and Light company plans to con
struct a 1200 megawatt nuclear
, reactor near Prairie City, between
30 and 35 miles from Grinnell.
Work on the reactor was suspended
in February 1977, but utility of-
ficials insistthat the reactor will be
lbuiltand‘go into operation by about
1985, This episode raises all too
familiar questions regarding the
Safety, economy, and propriety oi
nuclear power, and regarding the
ethics of the utility industry

Nuclear power plants are unsafe,
on three levels. First, the security
‘ of the reactors themselves is
questionable In 1974, 1,42;
malfunctions were reported at
nuclear power plants in the United
States. The emergency safety
systems used at most nuclear
power plants have never been
tested ltests on small scale models
thave resulted in 100 per cent
failure rates).

NUCLEAR reactors are grossly
underrinsured. The Price
Anderson Act provides liability for
utilities up to $560 milllon;
however, most estimates now
place the damages by a nuclear
accident at about $17 billion Thus,
there is no liability provided for by
law, in the event of a nuclear ac-
cident, for the majority of
damages caused by such an ace
cident.

On a second level, much of the
water used to cool nuclear reactors
to keep them from “melting down"
(the core of the reactor actually
melts, causing massive release of
radioactive material into the en-
vironment) is released into rivers
and other bodies of Water. Raising
the temperature of the water by
even a few degrees can threaten
fish populations, increase algae
growth, and seriously upset the
natural balance of the en
vironment, If current plans are

 

 

carried out, onethird of the runoff
water in the year 2000 will be
heated by power plants, a
significant portion of them
nuclear,

ON THE third level, and most
importantly, the radioactive
wastes emitted by nuclear reactors
present serious dangers to the
environment and to human life,
For example, a typical nuclear
reactor produces about 400 pounds
of plutonium annually. Pinhead
sized particles of Plutonium 239
can cause death within weeks;
larger quantities kill almost in
stantly. It is lethal for 24,000 years,
and no method of de—activation is
known, And plutonium, while
probably the most dangerous and
longrlived, is not the only radio
a‘ctive waste put out by nuclear
power plants.

No feasible, safe method for
disposing these wastes has yet
been found, At present they are
buried in steel and cement drums
in secluded areas However, the
drums frequently leak, and
radioactive waste escapes into the
enVironment.

IN March '3. over 500000
gallons of radioactive waste
escaped from the nation s largest
nuclear waste disposal station at
Hanford, Washington. This
January, near Sheffield, Illinois,
radioactive waste was found
seeping from a nuclear disposal
trench at a rate 25 times the rate
anticipated by experts. These are
only two examples of the frequent
leaks of nuclear waste So,‘ if a
nuclear power plant were built in
central Iowa, Iowans would be
faced with the prospect of large
quantities oi deadly radioactive
wastes, lethal virtually forever,
which cannot be safely disposed of.

In the years following World War
II, one of the strongest selling
points of nuclear power was its
extremely low cost. This
argument, however, is rapidly
losing its force. Building costs are
skyrocketing (Iowa Power
estimates costs to be rising by 7 per
cent annually), as is the cost of
nuclear fuel. Uranium now costs
$40 a pound. significantly higher
than its previous cost, and the
price is still rising, This inﬂation is
exacerbated by the fuel‘s scarcity,
which makes it susceptible to
cartels, just as oil is with the OPEC
nations.

THE proposed answer to this
inflation and scarcity has always
been the breeder reactor, which
produces nuclear fuel as one of its
byproducts. However, no feasible
breeder reactor has yet been
devised, and one is not likely in the
near future. One energy expert in

Oppose Iowa nuclear plant

Washington has said that, if a
breeder were started with present
technology. it would probably melt
down Within a few years,

In addition, the inefficiency of
nuclear power plants increases
their cost. Based on industry
estimates of nuclear power in 1980,
the nation's nuclear power
capability at that time will include
$121 billion in “design overrun"
(ie., unused, wasted energy),

DESPITE these disadvantages
of nuclear power, the question
remains: is nuclear power
necessary to meet our present and
future energy needs? The fact is
that numerous alternatives are
either readily available or will be
within a few years. The United
States has substantial reserves of
coal, which can be used to produce
electricity. Scrubbers
(daulphurizaiion systems) have
been proven 90 per cent reliable in
cleaning coal, so electricity from
that source can be produced
cleanly,

More importantly, solar energy

“will soon be available on an

inexpensive commercial basis.
Japan is presently heating nearly
half a million buildings with solar
energy. Existing solar technology
could provide 1530 per cent of the
nation's energy needs by the 1980's.
According to the National Science
Foundation, solar heating will be
costrfeasible in five years, solar
cooling in six to ten, In addition,
energy can soon be feasibly
produced from wind, from solid
wastes, and from methane gas in
algae, In short. safe. feasible
alternatives exist, at the present
time, to nuclear power

HOWEVER, Iowa does need
additional energy capacity in the
immediate future. The question is,
should these new facilities be
nuclear power plants? It appears
from this evidencbthe lack of
safety and economy in nuclear
power, and the availability of
feasible alternativesithat the
answer is no.

Apparently most Iowans agree.
In July of 1976, a Des Moines
Register poll showed that 57 per
cent of Iowans believed that
nuclear construction should be
delayed. When Iowa Power an
nounced plans for the Prairie City
reactor, widespread opposition
sprung up among the people of
Prairie City, citizens-groups,
student groups. and the general
public, including some Iowa Power
shareholders. In February 1977,
largely in response to this public
pressure, construction on the
Prairie City reactor was
suspended. At that time, Iowa
Commerce Commission chairman
Maurice Van Nostrand stated that
Iowa Power needed to answer
questions of fuel storage and
reprocessing, and economic
feasibility,

UNDAUNTED. Iowa Power has
launched a massive publicity
campaign in support of nuclear
energy. Handouts to stockholders,
inserts in bills to customers, and
widespread media advertising all

‘urge the public to accept the
= “necessity” of nuclear power.

The Iowa Power and Light
Company is urging Iowans to
accept an unsafe, uneconomical
form of energy which, in view of
the availability of feasible alter~
natives, is not necessary,
Hopefully, as a result of the
unanswered questions regarding
safety and economy, the Prairie
City reactor will never be built.

TOIearn more about the dangers
of nuclear power, we strongly urge
you to attend the Iowa PIRG-
sponsored film, The Last Resort.
