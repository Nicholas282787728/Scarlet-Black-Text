Soccer Team Drops Close One

In the closing minutes of a
well-played game, the Grin-
ncll soccer team received its
first loss of the season from
Knox by a score of 4-3.

,\ slow start permitted Knox
to take an early lead with two
fluke goals. The first occurred
when a shut glanced off the
chest ofa Grinnell fullbackand
was deflected into the far cor-
ner of the net, away from the
goalie. The second came on a
fullback kick, which bounced
off the back of another Grin-
nell player, and landed in
front of an aggressive Knox
forward, who promptly put it
in the goal.

determined, Grinnell played
on and picked up a goal on a
break—away shot by Steve Kor-
stad. Shortly before the half,
Knox scored a third goal on a
well-executed corner kick.
This left Grinnell behind by
3-1 at the end of the first

half‘ Knox sun
The game was played wellby
both teams. Those few hearty

fans who braved the inhospit‘
able weather were rewarded
with an exciting contest.

During the early part of the
second half, Grinnell showed

determined effort by keeping
the ball near the Knox goal.
A stiff Knox defense, with
five defenders shadowing
Grinnell’s four forwards,
made shooting difficult. A
fine shot by Peter Horowitz
showed, however, that the
Knox defense was penetrable.
Grinnell continuedto dominate
most of the second half. Steve
Korstad tied up the game by
putting in a penalty kick,after
being tripped during the act of
shooting, Then, the Grinnell
team seemed to relax for the
last few minutes of the game.
Knox kept the ball near the
Grinnell goal, and inthe C105.

their fourth and final goal.

This was a particularly dise

Safely Tells His Role

In deference to my policy of
bringing to the attention of
sports enthusiasts on campus
the more subtle aspects of
Grinnell football, Iwould like
to discuss my primary con-
ceron as a defensive safety--
my relationship both on and
off the field with linebackers
Mario Eognanno and Washing
ton Alston.

Most ful‘backs in the con
ference weigh in the vicinity
of 2007215 lbs. They usually
are quite fast and invariably
mean to beat the band. As a
defensive safety, I am about
seven or eight yards behind
my defensive line and about
10 or 11 yards from the op—
posing team's fullback. [weigh

see the problem? if this fast
and mean fullback who weighs

rolling, you can just imagine
the extent to which he would
wail upon my head.

If you still have difficulty

THREE QUALIFICATIONS

1.He has a strong desire to make money.
2.He has some free time.
3.He knows something about high fidelity.

Ifyou‘re a student with the above
qualiﬁcations, you are eligible to become the
Fisher representative on your campus.

Which could be the most proﬁtable thing
you‘ll do at college.

Proﬁtable in ii numbcrol ways. First of
all, you’ll get Fisher stereo equipment at
tremendous discounts. And you‘ll be able to

college so lztr (your major, your extra-
curricular activities. cm), and anything else
you think might inﬂuence us in appointing

you as our representative.

you should perform. Ifyou see
Wash or Mariowalkingaround
campus, stop him and askhim
to stand 10 yards from you.
Then yell ”hut" and have him
run straight at you full speed
(be sure to step out of the way
at the last second), Needless
to say, you will experience
something akin to the terror
I feel when a fullback makes
it into the secondary.

Fortunately, between the
fullback and myself stands my
defensive line and lineback—
ers. The defensive line plays
a major role in my continued
good health but in the final
analysis it is in the hands of
the linebackers afterall, they
have the last shot at the run'
ncr before he reaches me.

Given this, it is of utmost
importance thar Mario and
Wash like me. For if they
didn't like me, they might not
be as concerned about what
would happen to me if the
opposing team's fullback ran
into me. Now it should be
clear why my major concern
as safety is my relationship
with them.

On behalf of the entire team,
thanks for coming to our first
two games.

TB Team Discovers
Mud In 20-16 loss

It rained again last Saturday
during Grinnell College’s
second game of the football
season. If this continues, our
team should be well versed in
the secrets of mudball.
Lawrence won, the final
score 2016, although Grin-
nell had the better team dur’
ing this game. The Pioneers
had twenty first downs to Law»

gained Lawrence through the
air with 168 yards passing to
Lawrence's fifteen. Unfor-
tunately the Pioneers’running
game still needs much im»
provement, but if the players
can put it all together, they
should be a strong threat to
any team in the conference.
The @1116 began with the
Lawrence team taking theball
all the way for a touchdown.
However, they missed the ex~
tra point. After that Grinnell
controlled the ball most of
the time. Unfortunately, one
Pioneer drive was marred by
a missed field goal, and an
other ended with a fake field-
goal and an unsuccessful at-
tempted pass. The Pioneers
