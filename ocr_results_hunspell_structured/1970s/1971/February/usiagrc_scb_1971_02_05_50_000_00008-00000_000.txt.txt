Preps Sparkle In l-3 Record!

01 the prep scene, Grinnell’s
Young Pioneers are doing
fairly well and have some
players with potential. To
date, the preps have beaten
the hated Siwashettes of Knox
76*66, lost to Simpson 9779,-
and lost big only last Monday
to Coe.

Young Bill Bailey is current-
ly burning the nets at 30 plus
points per game. Dennis Moss
(remember himT-the QB for
North’s 1M football machine)
is also demonstrating a high
degree of potential, scoring a
consistent 12 points pergame.

Against Knox, Bailey led all
scorers with 30 points, follow-
ed by Dave Trefz with 15 and
Moss with 12. Bailey rammed
in 39 in the loss to Simpson
and was aided by jeff jense’s
17 and Moss' 13. Aginst Coe,
the Young Pioneers followed
the varsity’s example bystay-
ing close most of the game"
after trailing by 13, they do
sed to within two points with
five minutes left in the gamer-
and then fading rapidly.

Individually, Bailey again
scored heavily. As a team,
however, the preps needwork.
They need to learn teamwork
as, during the last five min-
utes of the game, they degen-

Once again Grinnell's bas-
ketball pioneers took it on the
chin over the weekend, losing
to Beloit 66-44 and getting
blasted by Coe 90*65. Grinnell
is now 1710 overall, and 176
in the conference as they cons
tinue their losing ways, ex-
tending their losing streak to
five games.

Against Beloit only Greg
Bombinski reached double
figures, netting 12points. High
scoring Bob Burnett was held
to a meager nine as Beloit
picked up their first win of the
season. Jerome Clark and
Fred Atlas led Beloit With 23
and 14 points, respectively.
This was, by far, Grinnell’s
shoddiest performance of the
season as they trailed 3818
at the half. The Pioneers hit
on only 18 of 63attempts from
the floor while Beloit hit 26

erated into five individuals in
a mad scramble for the basket.
Moss and a teammate, Steve
Sklae, are presently hampered
by injuries. if the youthful
machine can hold out until
their return to health, and if
they learn the advantages of
teamwork, the team should do
well throughout the remainder
of the season and provide some
badly needed replacements for
players lost from the varsity

due to graduation.

Major points of controversy
were over whether mixingso’

However, most senators felt

Wrestlers Improve Slightly, 43- 3

Grinnell’ 5 Mat Rats havcabn
sorbcd their fourth dual meet
loss of the season, but all is
n0t lost. They are improving!
Against Monmouth, they were
only beaten 4373. There wasa
winner, Big Bob Donelan, who
escaped defeat 5-3 in the 158
pound weight class. Grinnell
just missed two other winners
as Washington Alston almost
defeated his opponent 4-3, but
couldn't get a hand on him in
the last period.

As usual, the Grinnell team
had to give up 20 points on for
feits during the meet. This
presents a definite problem
in trying to win a meet. All is
not lost, though, as the indi-
viduals are finally gettinginto
shape and not succumbing to
pins in the first period. Part
of this improvement may be
due to a new conditioningdrill
in their schedule. If nothing
else, an hour of calisthenics
is loads of fun.

last Tuesday the matmen
took off for Cornell for a cer
tain defeat, but possibly a
moral victory. The next home
meet isn't for two weeks, by
which time there may be a

tangible improvement.

Daley Sets Record;A-Jocks 3-0

The Aqua~jocks continued to
be victorious in their endeavor
to remain masters of “Dily
the Duck." This trophy goes
to the tank team with the best
dual meet record. Grinnellis
now 370 in the conference as
of last weekend, due tovictor-
ies over Lawrence (63~ 36)and
Beloit (69-27). Sixteen of the
Guppies scored points for Gr-
innell as many reserves were
activated, and beating our re-
cent foes was about as tough
as making Pontoon blush.

On Friday, against the Viki
ings, Grinnellstarted the meet
off by setting a school record
in the Medley Relay and then
disqualified itself bynotexer-
cising enough self—control to
wait for the Lawrence team to
finish before Warming down.
The question is, "Who gets

_ pimped?"

Mike Daley, the meet’s only
double winner, set a new schr
ool record in the 1,000 yard
freestyle, erasing McFag-
got’s. He also won the 500
yard freestyle. Steve Ward
missed his 1M record by .7,
which left him speechless.

Financial Aid

(continued from page 2)

may will require aid. All but
maybe ten percent of those
applicants will formally apply
for aid, and show need of
assistance of some sort.

In the past, the college has
been able to give assistance
to most of those that need it;
however, there is no real
guarantee to those who are
notified of their acceptance
in April 1, the third and last
date an applicant may chose,
that there will be enough fin-
ancial aid funds left for all
those that need aid.

Grinnell's financial aid buds
get is actually quite large,
according to Ryan. Depending
on how aid is defined, either
slightly less than forty per-
cent or slightly more than
forty-five percent of the SEU’
dents receive it.

One major problem due to
lack of sufficient financial aid
funds is that for thepastthree
years there has been a steep
cutback in the number of for-
eign students offered financial
aid, and thus a large cutback
on foreign students.

Although some foreign Slud’
ents will be ableto comewitlr
out financial aid, most will
n0t. The number of applicar
tions from foreign students
the Admissions Office has re-
ceived since Ryan's letter
went out dropped by fifty per
cent. Probably only one or two
foreign students will come to
Grinnell on aid next year.
