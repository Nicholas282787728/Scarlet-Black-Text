Michael Novak, this Sunday and
Monday, delivered the Gates lece
tures entitled “The Meaning ofEdur
cation". He announced in the first
lecture two intentions to argue the
truth oi the aphorisms that politics
begins in mysticism and mysticism
ends in politics and that the central
role oi education is overlooked.

These themes, however, received
little attention,He gave much more
emphasis to the ”experience oi
nothingness” The iirst theme was
not mentioned until the third lecr
tnre. Education entered his lectures
as a tool to help one realize and
sustain this experience,

The iirst lecture “SevenSeals oi
Identity" was the explosionoimyths
we, as Americans, all hold which
annihilate the “experience oi noth-
ingness”, The second ”The Experi-
ence oi Nothingness“ described
more iully the experience itself and
how one came to experience it. The
third, “The Power oi Politics”
asserted and intended to demon
strate that political problems are
theological and vice versa.

The lectures were marked by a
lack oi philosophical rigor and a
dependence upon insightiul anec-
dotes revealing amusing aspects
about American and European soci-
ety. His “arguments” seemed more
to he “impressions" and were sup-
ported hy broad generalizations.
Consequently, he was much more
convincing as an entertainer and
commentator on American society
than as a theologian.

in his third lecture he deiined
theology as the study oipersonal and
communal visions oi identity: the
study or the various ways societies
and persons create and act outidenr
tities. A dubious deiinition indeed.

To synopsize the "main points” oi
his lectures is not to capture the
essence oi his presentation. His
delivery, a coloriul conglomeration
oi insights, really is more repre
sentative oi his ideas, and can harde
ly be duplicated. The iirst two leer
tures, anecdotes and all, were ese
sentially a restatement oi his book
Experience oi Nothingness, thethird
in large part a reiteration oi his
article in the September issue oi
Harper's magazine.

Eeiore an attempt is made to trace
his thought. a deiinition oi the “ex-
perience oi nothingness” would be
valuable, He gave none explicitly,
hut implicitly suggested that this is
a ieeling oi the meaninglessness of
lite, that all values we hold are me
vented and imposed upon us by socir
ety. And as he constantly quoted
Nietsche, Sartre and Camus,we may
assume it is quite like the existential
ieeling oi the absurdity oi liie.

Seven Seals
The enumeration oi the seven seals
oi identity gave unity and direction to
the iirst lecture. The iirst seal was
the contrast between American and
European experience oinothingness.
Due to optimism, American society
contrives to cover upthe experience
oi nothingness; we have a constitu-
tional obligation (sic) to be happy.
Europeans, however, aiter the
shocking experiences oi the world
wars on their home ground were
iorced to see the emptiness oi all
value and consequently constructed
the philosophy oi nihilism.
Secondly, Americans have a revo-
lutionary heritage, Jefferson ber
lieved there would be a revolution
every generation. This commits the
nation to rootlessness and to ate

tempting to achieve transcendental
values never to be realized; such as
equality.

The third seal was the American
commitment to the middle class and
the little man, an attitude unique in
history. The practicality oi this
class is indicative of the impover-
ished imagination in American liie.
Everything is evaluated ineconomic
terms.

Fourthly, the American con»
solousness demands that we live in
the middle range oiemotion,This is
a result of our devotion to wealth and
power as the highestvalues: wewant
to marry ourselves to machines. The
consequence of this is a feeling of
isolation.

He mentions education, the fifth
seal, as the religion of America.
This is the belief that progress is a
divine iorce urging on American
society. We believe we can achieve
success by teaching people to store
and analyze iniormation,

The Sixth point was labeled "im—
perial ideology”. Americans be-
lieve their lives are more important
than any other lives. We do not
realize thatour values areAmerican
and not Universal.

Finally Americans have the sense
of an overwhelming desire to choose.
The mobility ofour society makes us
ieel as ifwecangoanywhere,doany-
thing.

Nothingn ss

Novak did not, expli tly, make any
value yudgements on these myths; he
simply acknowledged them, In doing
so he estimated that he had demon
strated how basic to this nation is the
”experience ofnothingness“. Morer
Over he concluded that what We call
real is not very real and that this
recognition is the heartofhumanity.
The astute Grinnell audience,
having iollowed his lecture closely,
anticipated the points he would ad-
dress next. They succeeded in e ’-
ciling the points of his second lec-
ture in the discussion following the
first, So many excellent questions
have not been posed aiter a lecture
since the Rubenstein lecture Series.

Charming Evasiveness

Unfortunately, he met them with a
charming cvasiveness. The most
disconcerting reply was inanswerto
the query why he selectedthe values
of honesty, courage, freedom and
community. While henssured usthat
he had stronger reasons, he main-
tained thatlinndmissionthattheyare

arbitrary should be adequate. Hardly
a philosophical attitude.

The second lecture dealt with the
iertility oithe experience oinothinge
ness. Honesty, ireedom, courage,
and a sense oi community will lead
one to the experience, and a devotion
to these qualities will keep one there.
The condition is a desirable state,
though conducive to suicide, insane
ity, despair, and tear. it is the
“realist” response to life. Young
people approach it with their doubt
about the worthiness of their future
vocations, older people by reilec-
tion upon the worthiness oi their
past lives,

He delineated three cultures in
American Society; culture being that
from which one gets one’s sense of
reality. The neighbor culture results
when one takes the approval or diSr
approval oi one’s neighbors as a
gauge oi reality. Thehookculture is
a dependence upon weekly installe
ments in magazines and hookstoine
form one how to think. The eleCr
tronics culture--T.V., radio, and
music--causes one to View reality as
iluid and subject to rapid change.
One begins to feel that none ofthese
is real. He recommends that each
individual act with honesty and free-
dom and create a set of values for
himself, knowing that one’s choice

may be wrong

By the third lecture the humor had
worn a little thin, and the disconr
nected series of generalizations be—
came wearisome. The progress oi
the lecture was a little ambiguous.
We have come to a new time in
history, we don’t know What we are
doing or how to do it We are in a
political malaise because of a de-
(iciency of Vision. Political prob-
lems are theological. Theological
problems are political. There are
so many conflicts in American soc-
iety and so many diiiiculties in our
associations with different cultures
because we do not recognize the
various theologies.

The body oi the lecture, then, was
a listing of different ethnic chat-ace
teristics. These characteristics
were supposedly revelatory oi the
underlying theologicaldiiierences oi
the ethnic groups. Yet he centered
only upon superficial ethnic traits;
ltdlinns talk with their hands, Jews
know more about their maladies than
doctors, and the Irish don’t corn-

important, though, that the youngget
tough to be able to meet the cons
fusions of politics when we reach
middle»age. There was little tranr
sition between the former lectures
and the last. He did not suggest
why one experiencing nothingness
would become involved in politics.

Many Unsatisiied

The delivery was the pith or his
presentation. He described an ex-
perience many people coniront, and
did so entertainingly.

However he did not really relate
this to religion or theology, Ale
though he was billed as 3 Catholic
theologian the inﬂuence of either
Cathlicisim or theology upon his
work was perplexing indiscernable.
One would suppose religion might
provide an answer. Novak leit many
unsatisified as to how to deal with
the experience.
