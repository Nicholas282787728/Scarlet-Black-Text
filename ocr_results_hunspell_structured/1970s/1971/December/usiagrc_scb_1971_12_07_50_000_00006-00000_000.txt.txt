Governor Sees 'Healthy’ System

by Nancy Graham

Governor Robert Ray sees the new
young voters as being “fresh with
ideas and interests"whlch will be
”very healthy for the political sys-
tern." The Scarlet and Black intern
viewed the Governor Wednesday at»
ternoon at the Capitol in Des Molnes,
Ray stated his feelings on many is»
sues ranging trom the new concerns
or the young voter to the prominent
events in the state and nation.

Ray noted that he had “advocated
lowering the voting age a long time
hetore it was popular”. He was told
by his friends and members of the
party thathe “couldn‘t get nominated
let alone elected” if he continued to
believe in the 18-year-old vote. But
Ray went on to say ttlat he continued
to pursue the unpopular and placethe
bill before the Iowa Legislature. Ray
was quick to say that young voters

should not he c0n5idel‘ed as an out
side group (tor “Voters are voters”)
but the presence or the new voter
is the beginning of a ”new era and
very exciting era in politics”

Ray was also enthusiastic about
student organizational potential on
campus for the upcoming election,
He believes that the students “aren't
going to be wooed by gimickry or
hot rhetoric”. What will win the
tollowing ot the younger vote, ac-
cording to the Governor, is the“i‘e—
cord of the candidates, the attitude
or the party, and the direction in
which both are really going”.

Ray was quite excited about the new
voter and his role in society. He
hopes that “young people will remain
active" but he ”doesn’t believe in
violence” The governor stated, “I
do believe in active Interest and
Stimulated minds. But Work mustbe
tempered with reason. Concerned
students should have a good under
standing and a good foundation for
what they are doing".

He said he knew or many examples
of times when concerned citizens
had gone in to crack Something and
discovered that the information that
they had was all wrong. Once again,
he emphasized knowledge as the key
to action. Ray also announced that
young people were welcome in his
office because “the issues will effect
them more for a longer period”,

In discussing his own political
problems in the upcoming primary
and election, Ray noted that Lt. Gnvs
ernor Jepsen, who will oppose Ray in
the Republican primary, has not
taken a firm stand on the issues. Ac-
cording to Ray, when Jepsen an-
nounced his plans to run and the re-
porters questioned him as to his
motive ior seeking the nomination,
Jepsen replied, “I just want to be
Governor”, Ray noted that he has
continually taken a stand on all is-
sues and. therefore, the voter could

be more confident of his political
platlorm

Ray was told Ufthevisit to theGi‘in-
hell campus by John Tapscott, one or
the Democratic candidates [or the
gobernatorial nomination, and TapSr
cott’s complaints with the Iowa Weir
tare program. Governor nay replied
that the “program does need to be
overhauled” but that ”this is true in
every State”. Ray also noted that his
administration has increased welr
tare payments and diverted money
lrom the road-use lund to payments
for the elderly

A mayor consideration is the harm
or ihllation on payments lor the indie
gent. Ray said that “inflation has
hurt our welfare program but lf the
President's program does what it is
supposed to do it will help immense-
1y for continuing funding in the pros
gram "

Ray was quick to assert that lowa
has one of the best work—incentive
programs in the country, nanlelythe
Winn Program. He also thinks that
a major portion of the program
should be directed to findingjobs {or
the poor and not only granting them
monetary payments.

Governor Ray was also questioned
about his views an the nominationof
Earl Eutz as Secretary or Agriculr
ture. (The U.S. Senate confirmed this
nomination the day alter this inter
view.) Ray is generally opposed to
Butz but stated that he “will work
with him if his nomination goes
through,”

The major problem as Ray sees it
is that "Butz does not have thesltl'l-
port or the iarmers, the very people
that he must work with and that he
will represent." The Midwest was
never consulted on the reason for the
nomination of Eutz, according to
Ray. “They have never explained
why they chose this particular per
son."

Ray feels that the iarmers are up-
posed to Butz tor many reasons, one
of them being that “Butz is a pros
lessor, which doesn't [it the Conno—
tation the farmers have in a Secre-
tary ot Agriculture.” (Eutz was a
dean at Purdue University).

Ray swiftly asserted that he had
nothing against professors but that
“Butz may struggle the entire time
he is in ottice trying toovercomethe
handicap of not having the support of
the people he represents".

As a final question one of thegreat
Grinnell Sleuths asked theGovernor
if Tapscutt’s remark that Mr. Ray
never answered his mail was a lair
statement. TheGovernorvehement—
ly denied this. The reporters lett
the office sure that they had stirred
up a hornet’s next between the Cave
ernor and Senator Tapscctt.

LEAP's paper recyclingoperation-- .
perhaps the single most important

This poses a serious problem tor
the survival of the envirommental
consciousness at Grinnell.

Just as the “issue” of academic
pressure was found to be a symptom
at a general sense of alienation, the
failure of students to otter their ser-
vices to LEAP is probably a result
of that same alienation. Students
here have resumed their character
