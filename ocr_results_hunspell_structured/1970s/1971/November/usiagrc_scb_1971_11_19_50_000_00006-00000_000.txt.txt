Evaluations Evaluated

A report onlast semester’s student
evaluation or courses poll has been
presented by the ad hoc faculty come
mittee to the all college EPC and
executive council It will be ex
amined by the faculty this Monday.

The idea for the poll was initiated
by the executive council and written
by a subcommittee oftheEPC, com-
posed primarily oi students. Dean
\Vall appointeda conimiltee ofJames
ilaniilton, chairman, Karl DeLong,
James l-iottois, and George Furniss
to compile and evaluate the results
of the poll, aprc-test questionnaire.

The questionnaires were distri-
buted by Instructors in most classes,
exceptions being team teaching
classes like Biology 101, and 45%of
the student body returned them. The
low percentage oi returns isaprob—
lem, according to Mr. Hamilton,
because it’s difficult to tell how
representative it is, He suggested
that a better method of distribution
and collection is needed to insure a
larger response.

Mr, Hamilton said, “the student
evaluations have a relationship to
the effectiveness of the course, but
the committee can’t tell how the re
lationship works. It is not necessar-
ily a tight relationship." As ex-
plained in the committee’s written
report, "responses to a ques
tionnaire may not describe an in-
structor’s actual classroomperior-
mance. What they can provide are
important insights into what his stu-
dents perceive his classroom to be,
Tlle two are somewhat separate,
since students may not perceive the

actual impact an instructor has on
them." Mr. Hamilton added that the
poll is uselul in that it asks student
ieelings on a noneseleciive basis.
The executive council can thereiore
receive answers irom all students
to the same questions

Mr. Hottois and Mr, Hamilton ex-
pressed surprize on finding no
noticeable bias in question response
according to student class years or
grade point average. For example,
seniors, with more experience with
college teachers, did not rank in
structors significantly higher or
lower than did freshmen Students
with low grade point averages did not
rate instructorsdifferentlythan Stu-
dents with high grade pointaverages.
Mr. Hottols said he discovered,
"that the average Grinnell student
views the average Grinnell pro—
iessor as above average,” and won-
dered what basis ofcoinparison they
used.

Three student categories on the
questionnaire had response pattern
variations: 1) expected grade in
course, 2) percentage oi classes
attended, 3) percentage oi assigned
work completed. Responses shiited
from rating the instructors “excepe
tional" to “ average", “below aver
age", and " poor” as students exe
pected lower grades, attendediewer
classes, and completed less work.
The “above average” percentage
remained the same, however.

There are no speciflcplans, as yet,

to distribute another poll this
semester.

FSB In Dire Financial Shape

by Bill Knecht

Lower profit margins and student
theft threaten to estinguish FSB aid
to foreign students. The results are

a disastrous.

‘ inpast years, a numberoffinestm
dents have been brought to Grinnell
from other countries through the
financlal aid of the Grinnell Foreign
Student Board. Unable to financethe
costs szi Grinnell education them-
selves, tllese students have depended
on the FSB to provide money for
tuitions, room and board, and per-
Sonal expenses.

Through the years, the Board has
organized the sale at candy and pop
on campus, through the lease and
purchase of vending machines. The
profits from these machines have
normally enabled several extrafor-
eign students each year to enjoy a
stay at Grinnell.

This year things have changed.
During the first-semester change,
over from cans to bottles last year,
the FSB had almost no income, al-
though hills came in as usual. Dur-
ing the semesters lollowing, the
lower proiit margin on bottles, plus
an alarming theit rate or empties,
again cut into the Board’s toads--
this time, dangerously. A lurid of
$4000 at the beginning of last year
shrank to $230 bythe end oithat year,
forcing a cancellation of all planned
future commitments to foreign stu-
dents hoping to come to Grinnell.
This year has been scarcely better
than last. Incredible numbers of
bottles have been stolen, broken,
mixed in with the trash, or have
never returned to the racks. As a
result, FSB has just barelybeenable
to meet the commitments it has now,
Foreign students presently on aid
have been advised to tighten up their

Alums Meet, Dine

A dinner and discussion ior Grinv
nell area alumni and parents was
held Tuesday night. Most oi the
guests were accompanied by a slur
dent to the dinner held in the Quad.
Alter the dinner, the 56 guests were
escorted to Gardner Lounge wherea
panel discussion and questioneande
answer period were held.

The purpose oithepancldiscussion
was to acquaint the alumni with some
area oi current interest on the
college campus. First to speak was
Dave Rosenwasser. He discussed his
role on the Admissions Committee
Speciiically, he stressed the iact
that Grinnell students represent 49
states and 30 ioreign countries. He
also commented that he ielt the
school was in some danger or be
coming a “suburb oi Chicago“. To
help offset this problem, he urged
Grinnell area parents andalurnni to
encourage local high school students
to apply to the college.

Jim Jacobs spoke next about the

Freshman Tutorial program, He felt
the program hnsheengencrally suc-
cesslul. in particular, Jacobs stated
that the program was especially
helpinl in developing a close stu-
denteproiessor relationship This
is something he did not feel was
present in the iormer counselling
program.

The new campus housing program
was discussed byliancyGraham,She
broke the news that the school was
no longer divided sexually into North
and South Campuses, She also exe
pressed her confidence in the new
dorm program, stating that it helps
bring a closer practical understand-
ing between the men and women at
the campus She also mentioned the
new coeops and the Russian and
Music houses

Steve Grow next talked about towns
gown relations. He mentioned that
there are still a number otservices
which the college provides either
through programs it sponsors or

because oi the college volunteers
who helps stall the organizations.
Grow said he was concerned about
the possibility that Very little com-
municatlon takes place outside these
channels.

Finally, Shelly Floyd made some
generalities about the life of the
1971 Grinnell student. She felt the
student body had become more di-
versified. For example, more stu-
dents were taking courses that pre-
viously had rather low enrollment
She felt that some of this new in-
terest was due to the new grading
system. She also touched on the
Women’s Lib movement, stating that
it suffered in the past from arather
poor reputation, but now it was be
ginning to play a strong role in the
affairs of the campus.

At the end of the panel. the ﬂoor
was opened to questions. Questions
covered all sorts oi topics, but as
could be expected, areas like cared
housing and the new grading system
received attention.

Council Ponders All-Nighters

by Phil Sasich

Last Monday a motley crew olstue
dents, resident advisors, and counr
selDrs met with the faculty Executive
Council to discuss the tension and the
overwhelming work load ielt by many
students. The purpose or the meeting
was to make the Executive Council
aware of the problem and toattempt
to arrive at some kind of consensus
solution as regards action by which
to deal with the situation.

President Leggett opened the meet
ing by explaining its purpose. He
called on Mr. Obermiller, who said
first that there has been, since mid-
semester break, a severe general
depression prevailing on campus
similar to that which usually floods
Grinnell around finals week.

He and other counselors have seen
a marked increase in the number of
students coming to them ior reasons
of academic pressure. Obermiller
stated clearly that for him the prob-
lem was a fact which the Council

Student Housing Crowded

Prospects for room changes torthe
second semesterare notverybright,
according to Jim Tederman, Assise
taut Dean of Student Affairs,
’Tederman’s office has received
numerous requests ior single
rooms, especially by upperclass-
men, but Tederman notes that since
room accommodations may be very
tight for the second semester there
will be “many disappointed people.”

In order to assure that room selec—
tions for next semester are as fair
as possible, Tederman reports that
it may be necessary to resort to that
timeless method that never fails--
drawing irom a hat. People nowliv.
ing alone in double rooms should be
aware that they may find a roommate
assigned to them next semester unr
less they find a person of their own
choosing to occupy the room. Anyone
living in an open double whudesires
a single should putarequest in soon,
he said.

Oil-campus housing is open to jun—
iors and seniors who must first get
permission from the Office of Stur

dent Affairs. if the student is under ,

twentyrone, the Office must receive

a signed note ofpermission from the‘

student's parents. Students wishing
to fill an opening in a co-op must
apply to the comp personally.
Adding to the problems ofthe room
situation is the uncertainty re~
garding the number ofstudentsleavr

ing and the number returning iorthe
next semester. Tederman predicts
that the specific numbers will notbe
known until December 1, wheiitrans-
fer students and Students who have
applied for the various ACM off-
campus programs are notified ofthe
decisions.

Last year there were eighty-two
students iewer tor the second
semester. This year the Office oi
Student Aiiairs is anticipating adif—
ferent situation, however. Many slur
dents who withdrew irom school
previously or who have been on med-
ical absence wish to return, and to
that number must be added a sub-
stantial number oitransier students
The availability or rooms, therelore,
depends heavily on the number of
people who plan to withdraw,

should accept as such and begin
talking about possible relief. “lithe
tension is high now,” he said. “lain
afraid to think what finals will be
like.”

Phil Sasich presented a set of
statistics derived from an inter
view survey of Loose Hall resi-
dents. The random sample, which
included 62 of 95 people, showed
that about 1/3 of the sample spent
8 hours per day or morestudyingon
the average. The overall average
was about 6 hoursperday(exclusive
oi class time). About 2/3 or those
interviewed were not able to keepup
with their work given the amount of
time they spent studying (average
ior these people was 6 hours per
day), and about 1/2 or those who
were keeping up were barely doing
so.

Further questioning (with corrob-
oration by personal knowledge) found
that most people had been studying
steadily through the semester, and
that in most cases their pressured
plight would be aggravated in coming
weeks The statistics on the incir
dence of all-nighters and speed
consumption brougtit boobs and
aahhs from the crowd.

Chip Sholstall said that he had
talked to people who admitted that
they didn’t have all that much work,
and that he felt the depression and
tension were due to other more per-
sonal and basic problems. He felt
that the lack of jokes and the basic
question “why am Ihere'?” were
important contributors to the
morose atmosphere. Rosemary Ash,
RA. in Mears, stated that she had
noticed a signiiicant increase in
pressure, and that non-academic
factors were part of the reason.
The R.A.’s and the students de'
bated for a few more minutes, and

finally Mr. Guroff stated that he
was confused as to the nature of the
problem, and questioned whether it
really existed, since it is the pure
pose oi the prolessor to work his
students hard; or if it is the result
of students’ need for an issue. He
could identity no increase in preSr
sure in his classes and stated that
he had even cut the reading load in
one of his classes. Sasichsuggested
that if a problem existed students
were bringing it upon themselves.

General response was that the nae
ture oi the problem was probably
inclusive oi several factors, in»
cluding increased student interest,
but that the problem nevertheless
requires some shorteterm relief in
perspective of a long-range examine
ation.

Other council members expressed
the view that the problem was not due
to academic matters, but emotional
factors. Mr. Clotfeltei' said that
he saw a contradiction in

the need for allenighters and the 6-
hour day that was the average. Mr,
Morris suggested that discussions
between professors and their
classes should be occurring, where
appropriate direct measures such as
extensions on papers, limitations on
papers and take-homes, and deletion
of work load Should be considered.

Finally, President Leggett sum—
marized the debate and suggested
solutions, and reiterated the feeling
of most of the Council that it (the
Executive Council) could not legis-
late a policy on the matter and could
at most only make a statement of the
problem to the iaculty and suggest
that individual professors discuss it
with their classes. Later that even—
ing President Leggett did issue such
a statement to the iaculty.
