Concert Rn'ses Policy Issues

The issue of free admission
to strangers at Grinnell rock
concerts which has disturbed
many since Saturday's Young-
bloods concert has been taken
up by the Committee onSocial
Policies.

Peter Keepnews and Ed Lee
vine met with the committee
to represent the Social Coor-
dinating Committee's point of
view.

They told the committee that
the major problem this week-
end was that KFMG radio in
Des Moines apparently an
nounced that there would be a
free concert in Grinnell. They
were worried about how the
station found out since the only
announcement of the concert
was in the Grinnell activities
calenﬁr.

J.C. Labowitz expressed his
personal dismay at the large
number of outsiders. He felt
that the entire atmosphere of
the concert was changed and
that because of the crowd he
and many Other Grinnellians
were unable to enjoy the con
cert.

Barbara Johnstone agreed
with Labowitz and added that
the intensified use of stimu-
lants and the hasslingofGrin'
nellians were of particular
concern to her.

Levine spoke in favor of an
open campus policy and sug-
gested that havinga springand
a fall concert outside in the
afternoon might be one way of
alleviating many of‘the prob
lems. The committee dis~
played little enthusiasm for
this idea.

Committee consensus seems

cd tofavor some sort Ofticketr
ing system that would enable
Grinncllians to bring with
them a limited number ofperr
sonal friends. However, Keep-
news CXpressed the obvious
objection: how doyouiell legit
timaic guests from strangers.

Another problem was whatto
do if a thousand strangers
were stranded outside Darby
clamoring to be admitted to
the concert. The committee
was disinclined to invite the
police on campus, but some
saw no alternative.

One method of alleviating the
crowd was suggestedby Keep-
news: advertise in Iowa City
and Des Moines that Grinnell
now has a closed concerts
policy and that those without
campus friends would not be
admitted. The effectiveness of
such a strategy was left in
doubt. ‘

It was recommended thatany
decision be submitted to the
students via referendum or
opinion poll before implemen~
ration.

In a related development, Bob
Meyer told the 5&3 that the
Executive Cabinet of SGA has
been discussing the problem,
including the complications of
implementation.

The committee made no final
decision Wednesday, buthopes
to reach a decision at next
Wednesday’s meeting.

All committee meetings,
Wednesdays at noon in the
Forum PDR, are open to all
comers. Opinions on theissue
can be deposited in writing in
the SGA mailbox.

objective. In addition, he said
that reporters for three ofthe
four Chicago papers took out
advertisements in their own
papers to oppose the editorial
positions.

Friedman said the most dise
turbing aspects of the cams
paign were Daley‘s successful
appeal to prejudice and “the
feeling that he conjured up
that the way to solve compli-
cated problems of today is
with methods of yesterday”
-— the political machine and

 

boss. Chicago, he fears, may
not be the seat of the last
such political machine,but the
model for the future.

A brief questionrandranswer
session followed Friedman's
speech. When asked ifheplan-
ned to run for office again,
Friedman replied, "Not for a
long time, if ever. This was ’
kamikaze politics in the ex-
treme!" And when questioned
about possible successors to
Daley, he said with a straight
face, "Onepossible successor
to Mr. Daley is Richard Mi-

employees, a water truck and two Grinnell students
spent last Saturday morning planting new trees all
over town. A request for student help produced a
poor showing, but those who did show up helped plant
an estimated 60 trees. The trees are being planted to

replace Griniiell’s ravaged elnis.

ordered trees from the city at a total cost of $2 per
tree; local schice clubs and the city picked up most
