THE SCARLET AND BLACK

loewi. Will Students USE Power?

by Yvor Stoukley

In a recent iterview with
this reporter, ex-Student Gor
vernment president Any Loewi
assessed the Student Govern-
ment activities of the past
year with mixedandsomewhat
bitter feelings.

“In terms of increasing the
role of students in the govern-
ance of this institution, we
made tremendous progress,"
Loewi remarked, pointing to
student involvement in the Co»
mmittee-A structure, Educ?
tional Policy Subcommittees
and the Freshman Year Com»
mittee.

“These are important pluses
and have already had tangible
results in getting some of the
things done student wanted.
In the decisions of the Fresh
man Year committe ,the input
of students has been cruc»
ial.”

Loewi went on to note that
he feels that SGA has ac-
complished about all that is
needed in terms of structural
input into the decision-makr
ing process by students. He
feels that the “studentpower”
issue was finally settled thr-
ough the changes made this
year and a few changes which
will not be initiated in the
fall, such as college sponr
sored course evaluation by
students.

"It all came together this
year," he said. ”Now the
question is “Will they (the
students) use the power?” I
frankly wonder if anyone still
gives a damn. One of themajr
or problems facing the newly
elected student government
administration will be getting
people to utilize the tools they
now have."

"I'm very concerned about
the political nature of this
mmpus," he continued, “both
in national afmirs and in gov-
erning‘ of their ovm lives. It’s
a sad state of affz
a sad State of affairs when
you almost have to beg to get
committee participation, or
when there is such a low level
of participation in theelectivc
process as witnessed this
spring or when a serious can-
didate for office has toadverr
tise that he’s not a jag."

Four Seniors

"We ought to get rid of the
misconceptions about what it
is to go to seminary," said
Jim Spell, beginning a panel
discussion in Younker Lounge
Wednesday on the subject
"Why I'm Seriously Considr
ering the Seminary.’

Four senior participants sh—
ared their opinions with a
small audience - reflecting
the prevalence of misconcep-
tion on the Grinnell campus.
Spell gave his reason for tho
casing the seminary:

“My junior year lbegan rear
ding Harvey Cox and other
theologians who were very
exciting. I also found that the
ere is a lot of money in the
church. It's easy to get grants
for doing various social pros
jects."

Dave Ruhe also credited Gr—
innell . notably classes with
Denis Haas - withre-awaken-
ing him from disillusionment
he felt after experiences in
his home church. A pastor
“who was suggesting that
maybe Viet Nam wasn’ta good
idea and maybe there were
some racists in the neighbor-
hood was completely destroys
ed by the people and kicked
out of the church.”

Dennis Haas, also in attend-
ance, was asked why he had
chosen the seminary:

In addition to arousing stu-
dent interest in their own go-
vernance, Loewi sited the quar
iity of hall life as the second
major problem facing SGA
President Shelly Floydandher
colleagues.

”The hall living system was
the Other area in which [think
we failed," he said. ”The real
core of the problem is making
it a real social living situate
ion."

The students elected reflecta
good deal of expertise in that
area. Shelly was, in my opinr
ion, far and wide the best
house president this year and
diat’s the area she’s going to
have to concentrate most of
have to concentrate most of
her time in. I think the hall
systems should involve int-
electual as well as social ac
tivities. The halls should in-
teract with other segments of
the community such as faculty
and townspeople."

Loewi did not view his term_
in office as ”all peaches and
cream." He lashed out st-
rongly at the press coverage
received in the Scarlet and
Black.

“Student government has a
really lousy image,” he re-
marked,, “There are many
areas in which we could have
been legitimately criticised
by no one knew enough about
what was going on to offer
constructive criticism.

“Part of the responsibility
falls on the StudentrCoordir
nator, but I think we were let
down by the 5&8. KDIC News,
in my opinion, was laughable
this year.

"The other problem," Loewi
continued, referring to pr-
ess coverage, "was the Sent
ate itself. It was a rather
serious handicap which 1 th»
ink will be helped by the new
arrangement. The rather ‘offr
hand' and humorous columning
about the Senate -where no
thing was happeningwrdidn't
help."

He sited the Student Gov-
ernment’s role in abolishing
requirements as one specific
area of poor press and pub
lic relations.

“Student Government played
a very important role in the

whole debate that lead to the
abolishment of requirements,
but students don't have any
idea. That‘s an example of
what Student Government Gln
do for people.

"I realize a great deal of
the burden (of public relatr
ions) rested on my shoulders
too But I spend most of my
time with the requirements
debate and the president's re-
organization plan.“

Loewi concluded the inter-
view with a statement of tem-
pered hope for the current
SGA administration. “I think
to a certain extent,” He
said, “a number of students
made my job and the job of
my colleagues unpleasant this
year. I hope the attitude tow-
ard Student Government im-
proves and people take an in~
terest in what Shelly and
others are doing.’

Calls For More Aggressive Scarlet & Black

by J. C. Labowitz

The presence of the alternar
tive media people reminded
me of the fact that I intend-
ed to write a column about
the media, alternative or 0th
erwise, at Grinnell. We have
two main sources of informar
tion , the Scarlet and Black
and KDIC, with no form of
alternative media since the
demise or ﬂight of High and
Mighty, the successor to Ft
crdactyl as the local under-
ground journal. Thus the
burden is on KDIC and the
5&B for all information, and
I feel that their potential val-
ue is many times greater than
what their realized value has
been this year. Iwould like
to talk about that for a while,
The Scarlet and Black and
KDIC have assumed a rather
unusual role, as far as lam
concerned. Almost without

exception, these bodies have
been passive in their role of
supplying information to the
campus. By that I mean that
the average issue of the S&B
contains articles that are su-
mmaries and reviews of 6V’
ents that have occurred, with
features generally on people
who have spoken here or cam-

Tell Seminary Misconceptions

“I was well into ROTC in
college. Then some friends at
Union told me about it. It
sounded interesting, so Iwent.
After a few weeks they had
completely destroyed all my
Sunday school faith and [was
ready to leave. But I had paid
for the semester, so I stayed
and ultimately finished the
whole course." .

Larry Grimm's reason led
into a discussion of the self
consciousness people felt in
choosing the ministry: “I had
a good experience with my
church at home. I spent four
years here trying to think of
something I’d rather do. I
guess that was bccause of the
stigma attached to the minis»
try. But I get over that, and
it looks good to me now be-
cause of the freedom it
allows.’I

Ruhe later indirectly dis-
agreed with this: “1 sec my—
self in a parish ministry, but
I'm having reservations about
it. When people looks at you
strangely and say “You’re
going into the ministry, you?’
- that shows a lot about the
kind of role you‘re expected
to play. I don’t really know if
the church can be used for
social change."

Participants seemed on the
whole rather optimistic about

the chances foraction and suc-
cess in their chosen field.
Spell noted that at Christian
Theological Seminary in In»
dianapolis he will ”take courr
ses exactly like thosefor grar
duate work in communica-
tions. When you're involvedin
the church somehow, you have
authority. Nobody can say,
he’s just a hippie radical.’

"And there’s definitely rea
son for being involved in or-
ganized churches. WE aren't
talking about a bunch of little
parishes like in Keokuk, Iowa.
The Lutheran Church in the
Midwest, for example, cons
trols publishing houses, real
estate, and department SIO’
res.”

Ruhe described his exper~
iences working at a Presbyr
terian Church in Minneapoc
lis one summer:

“I worked with elementary
school kids, and it was excit-
ing in ways I never would
have imagined. They were
mostly on welfare, but I thou-
ght it was going to be one of
those first-one-in the-van-
getssarlollipop things. Then
a five-year-old girl looked
me right in the eve and said
‘Who wants your fuckin lolli-
pop anyway? It was an educar
tion."

pus programs and individuals
like the resident advisors. The
news on KDIC (which I am
much less familiar with) is
generally confined to reading
the UPI wire and again sums
marizing campus events.

Without intending to be self-
congrarulatory, I think that
I assumed a role of the cam-
paign newsman. If any initiar
tive was regularly demonr
strated in the 3&8 this year,
it was in the biased, inaccur'
ate,
that I produced, and that is a
crime - thatthoseissueswere
presented in that light. The
only diseussion of some is-
sues that demanded attention
was in my column -- such as
the social program, care of
landscaping on campus, the
value of speakers, even the
need for pinballs (you idlew
I couldn't go a week without
mentioning them). Again, my
purpose is not self-admirar
tion. I do not feel that the
attitude that I took was the
best one for discussing such
issues as these, and there
are many issues that Iwould
not or could not touch that
cried out for attention.

It is in these other issues
(and there are a great many)
that the 5&8 has failedtomeet
its own potential. By assum-
ing such a passive role, die
5&8 ignored the power that
the paper (and really only the
paper and perhaps KDIC have
that power) has to inform the
campus and move it to action.

rabble- rousing a rticles »

I loiow just from the reaction
I got from my articles that
great power is held by the
paper, and this is as it should
be. The paper reaches every
member ofthe community,and
if an issue is presented in the
paper, everyone isaware ofit.

Yet the S&E this year chose
to be non-aggressive in using
that power, and I feel thatthis
is too bad. The media on (3m,
pus should be the watchdogs
of what is happening: propos»
ing, reviewing, criticizingand
moving to action. Ithink that
it is mute testimony to the
media here that the number
of letters to the editor was
less than ten for the entire
year. That, to me, speaks
directly to the failure of the
paper to be anything but a
passive newsletter.

I do not intend to demean
the efforts of the people on
the 5&8 staff. Ihope that the
staff will understand what my
purpose was in this effort ,.
to challenge next year’s staff
(and the campus in general)
to go look for stories about
what should be going on in
addition to talking about what
went on last week. Commltt
tees (now possessing great
power) should not be allowed
to wander around as they p1.
ease but instead feel that they
are being watched. The issues
that are here should be talked
about, and there arcanalmost
endless supply. Next week I
would like to talk about some
of those issues.

Russo Adds Obieciions To Bill

To the editor:

A problematic feature of the
Model Bill of Rights and Re-
sponsibilities which was not
mentioned in the letter writ
ten to the 5&8 by Mr. Keeble
and Mr. Nasser stems from a
faulty assumption found in the
preamble of the document.
To refresh the mind of the
reader, the preamble asserts
that members of the campus
have an obligation to fulfill
the responsibilities incumbent
upon all citizens, as well as
the responsibilities of their
particular roles within the
academic community. Other
obligations to which members
of the college are bound in-
clude respecting the funda*
mental rights of others as
citizens, the rights of others
based upon the nature of the
educational process, and the
rights of the institution.

The assumption upon which
this document rests is that
were is not nor ever will be
a conﬂict between the rights

of the institution and the fun-
damental rights of others, both
of which members of the coin
lege are obligated to respect.
That this assumption is not
warranted does not need elar
boration. Therefore, in the
case of such a conflict be
tween the two sets of rights,
to which set are members of
the community ultimately
bound?

My understanding is that the
president ofthe college is con-
sidering making all or a part
of the document the introducr
tion to the bylaws, which is
tantamount to saying that this
document in total or in part
will serve the same function
to the college as common law
has in England for so many
centuries. The location in the
fundamental laws of the coir
lege of a document pretlicar
ted upon such a faulty assum-
ption is clearly lllradvised
and I therefore urge the Pre,
sident toabandon the proposal.
