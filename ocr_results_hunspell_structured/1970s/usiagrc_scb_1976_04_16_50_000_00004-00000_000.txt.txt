Students neglect
budget decisions

”Go ahead, decide what I want," is what the student body
has said so far to the SGA Finance Committee Concerning
next year’s SGA budget, Right now five people are deciding
how $78,550, SGA's estimated income for next year, will be
spent.

Three Finance Committee public hearings held this week,
two of which were widely publicized, drew only sparse at-
tendance. Those present were people presenting specific
budget proposals for their organizations.

By their absence students are allowing Finance Committee
members to decide the amount of allocations to the Public
Events Committee, concerts and movies funds, the S&B,
KDIC, SGA administrative functions and the Initiative
Fund, next year.

Finance Committee members have demonstrated their
wish for student input by holding open meetings and putting
out an elaborate budget survey. Though the survey is one of
the better accomplishments to come out of student govern-
ment this year, several committee members and others are
making the mistake of quoting it as if it were the gospel.

The questionnaire was distributed randomly to one third
of the student body. To date, only about 160 completed
fonns have been received. By quoting survey returns as
indicative of student opinion in general SGA members
appear to be making the same mistake some administrators
do when they use the Institutional Self-Survey to represent
overall student sentiment.

Students other than the 160 or so who replied to the
survey still have a chance to get their say in. The Finance
Committee is presenting its proposed budget for next year
Monday at 7 pm. in South Lounge. With revisions, if
necessary, the committee plans to submit the proposal to
Joint Board at Wednesday night’s meeting. They are asking
that each hall hold hall meetings to discuss the budget
proposal before a Joint Board vote is taken.

Budget proposals that have been submitted to the
committee in the past week ask SGA for between $25,000
and $30,000 more than SGA's projected income for next
year, Obviously, substantial cuts will have to be made.

Salaries for the SGA cabinet, 5&8 editors and KDIC
executives is an area that should be examined. SGA
treasurer Mark Nissen has proposed that these salaries be
based on job wages given up. Pointing out that the minimum
wage on campus just rose to $1.87 and will rise January 1,
1977 to $1.97, Nissen has suggested substantial increases in
the salaried positions. These increases would mean that
$3,000 to $4,000 would have to be foregone by other
organizations.

Students forfeited their chance this week to decide how
their money will be spent. If the opportunities coming up are
also ignored it will be a sad comment about students' con-
cern for their own lives at Grinnell.

Limited North Campus
housing options protested

To the Editor:

We are once again approaching
room draw Lime, and cons
versations increasingly turn lo the
subject of where one wants to live
and the more realistic con-
sideration of where one will be able
to get a room. Due to my imminent
graduation lam (happily) exempt
from the anguish and chaos, but I
have none the less become very
aware of [he dissatisfaction of
many students with housing
possibilities on Norlh Campus for
next year.

We have already had conﬂict
over the olicampus policies that
have been made, and it seems that
Student Affairs has made equally
poor decisions In the designation of
special dorms, Unwiuingly, the
number of rooms in desirable
dorms on North Campus has been
cut drastically: Smith is once
again the Quiet Dorm, Dibble has
been given to the IDC and the
Writers, and Gates and Rawson are
(as they always have been) single
sex. Clark is co-ed by floor, and
Clark first and Dibble annex are

group draws. Langan has so far
gone untouched; if it remains so,
there will be strong competition for
rooms lhcre.

There are admittedly lhree other
dorms on North Campus, but
Cowles, Younkers, and with
apologies lo Skidmore, Owings,
and Merrill, and those who do
enjoy living there) Norris are
unquesiionahly the last dorms lo
be filled. Younkers' atmosphere
smacks vaguely of a mental in»
slifution, Cowles reeks of Saga
(and is lhe traditional refuge of
freshmen and sophomores who
Can't quite make it with a room-
mate), and Norris has a noise
problem and is all too reminiscent
of a chopped~down Holiday Inn.

South Campus is fortunate in
that most rooms are desirable;
rooms are taken quickly every
year, and Will go even more
rapidly this year.

I feel there have been decisional
errors made by Student Affairs in
lhelocation of these project dorms,
and not enough thought has been
given to the balancing of the

KDIC 10:30 staffers

To the Edi

We anticipated that our
resignation from the KDIC News
Staff would be criticized in some
quarters, but hardly expected ii to
emerge in the form oi the untrulhs
and halfrtruths contained in two
letters published in the April 9
Scarlet and Black. While We do not
wish to needlessly perpetuate this
controversy, we feel that no person
or persons have the right to
deceive the campus community.

Addressing first the ”News
Staffers," their contention that MS.
Blair was “rarely confronted with
criticism by the 10:30 News Staf ”
isa misstatement ofmindboggling
proportions. On numerous oer
casions we brought our opinions
and suggestions :to Ms. Blair's
attention, only to see her ignore or
disregard them. Criticism was
unwelcome in the extreme, but to
contend lhal it was not present is
factually erroneous We took these
criticisms lo the Sluden|
Publications and Radio Committee
only as a last resort, and after it
was abundantly clear that the news

Recycling and indifference

by Bull Aldrich

A move to recycle newspapers
has begun at Grinnell, rather
quietly and without much notice. It
is not especially grandiose, other
than a few ”Pitchnln” signs around
campus and lhe boxes wilh
newspapers, there is nolhing to
signify its presence. So each week
a few people get together and
quietly gather up newspapers to be
shuttled up to Ames.

If this makes [or boring reading.
thal is to be expectedithere is
nolhlng very glamorous aboul
bundling up newspapers and
carting them around. It is a step,
however small, towards Con-
servation, something sorely and
easily neglected in a small Iowa
college.

Looked at from a broader con»
lexl, lhe indiilerence toward any
ecological concern is inevitable,
.given the attitude ol students
.|od:ly. Grinnell has become, in

essencegapolilical,‘ with some:

director would continue to be
unreceptive to them.

As [or the final paragraph which
refers to the “lack of regimen-
tation or policing which the 10130
News Staff seems to desire," we
would remind the writers that our
concern was not a lack of
regimentatlon but a lack of
organization, not a lack of policing
but a lack of leadership.

The letter of [he “KDIC execs” is
equally contemptuous of the truth,
We refer especially lo lwo
statements: firstly, that both the
station manager and the program
director of KDIC felt that Shelly
should be retained: secondly, that
we were not willing to work with
her despite “repealed attempts
and compromises” on her part,
When we first brought our case
before the Committee, in open
session incidcnlly—nol closed as
was stated. [he program director
was [here and fully supported our
position, Not only did he volunteer
the opinion that Ms. Blair ought to
be removed, he also spoke of
repeated iullle attempts to gel her

residue of aclivlsm left over,
Every week our mailboxes get
filled with paper that is invariably
thrown away, because no one gives
a damn enough lo make a serious
effort to recycle it. We have
become indifferent to our en-
vironment, physical as well as
social, and [his attitude leads to
some obvious difficulties.

If it is true. as last week‘s S & B
suggested, that Nollen house has
become isolated, are not students
to some extent responsible? ll

Point of view

undesirable laculiy cuts are taking
place and there is no student
outcry, then who are we to blame?
The Grinnell student body is rm.
potent because it chooses to be.

Bul what does all of this have In
do with recycling?

, Sim y put. it is one example of a ‘

way in which students can affect

campuses; I am not disputing the
validity olproject dorms or the
need for singlesex dorms, but
protesting the concentration ol"
these dorms on one side of campus.
The choice available lo students
who want to live on North Campus.
is severely limited, and since the
number of students who will be
allowed to live off—campus has also
been decreased, [his will cause the ,
competition for ”free” rooms in‘
general in be grealer.

Sludenl Affairs should make an
attempt to reexamine ils decision
process in respect to housing. it
seems more mistakes affecting the
student population as a whole have
been made this year than in years
past. To alleviate lhe cons
centratiun of “special" dorms.
perhaps some system of switching
those dorms from one campus £0.13
another every one or two years
could be developed, But as it
stands now the housing setup for
lhe coming year has unfairly ‘
limited the options and choices
normally availablein the matter of
housing—Betsy Spencer

to assume greater responsibility
for the operation of the news staff.
Now the program director has
inexplicably reversed himseli, to
the point of cosigning the April 9
letter. What personal demon
prompted this decision to

conscionable doubledealing, _

aware solely of her repeated

paper is one of [he most simple,
