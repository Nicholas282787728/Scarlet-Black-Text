Early in last Saturday’s game
against Carleton, everything was
right. The stands were packed, the
weather was good, and the football
Pioneers were toying with the
opposition Nothing was going to

Field.

In the end. nothing did ruin it. but
Carleton had given it a good try.

Grinnell jumped out to a 36-0 lead
and fought off a rally to win, 36-26.
The Pioneers now have a 2-2
record, with both wins coming at
home. In both victories, the team
has fought off late rallies to win.

For the first two quarters of
Saturday's game, the Pioneers
played what Head Coach Edd
Bowers said was the best half of
tootball the team had played all
year. They scored four touchdowns

and gained 284 total yards in the
half. Mainly because of excellent
blocking and pass protection, the
Pioneers were able to move the
ball almost as they pleased.

In the first quarter, Steve
Bolesta, who switched from
defensive end to linebacker for this
game, intercepted a Carleton pass
to set up a touchdown bomb by
quarterback Paul Crane. End Paul
Delaney caught the scoring strike.

So what else is new? Delaney is‘

averaging ten and a half points per
game.

Later. fullback Tom Goetz, who
led all rushers with 162 yards and is
only 22 yards shy of a school record
for career yardage, scored an a 27.

by a penalty. Undaunted, Crane
got another touchdown on the next
play, this time through the air to
Wopat.

Two short scoring runs, one by
Crane in the second quarter and
one by Goetz in the third quarter,
completed the 36-0 lead. It looked
as ir Grinnell was trying to run up
the score in the second and third
quarters, but Bowers said later
that he did not think the team had a
large enough lead to guarantee
victory.

As it turned out, he was right.
After Grinnell made many sub-
stitutions, the Carls rallied With
twenty-six points in the iourth
quarter on two long passing and
two short running touchdowns.
Grinnell fought off the comeback
when Doug Cummings recovered a
Carleton onside kick and Bowers
sent the starting unit back into the
game. The coach admitted that me
substitutes made mistakes. but
added that he had no regrets about
playing them.

Besides a good effort by the
offense. which had 418 total yards
and is now second in the c0n~
ierence in points scored, the
defense played well [or most of the
game. Using a three-man line for
the first time this year along with
tight secondary coverage. the
defense stopped the Carleton
passing game in the first three
quarters, which the Carls usually
rely on to win.

Because of an outstanding team
effort. the coaches gave the
Pioneer of the Week awards to the
entire squad.

Tomorrow, the Pioneers play the
Cornell Rams at Cornell. The
Rams, who are 34, clobbered
Grinnell, 40-12, last year and are a
tough defensive team.
