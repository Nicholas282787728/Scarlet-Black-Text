Workers’

by John Wylie

Teamsters Local 90, representing
Grinnell’s Physical Plant workers,
reached agreement with the College
Saturday A'ug. 26 on a new two—
year contract, with benetits which
are retroactive to July lst.

College Treasurer DonaldLambie,
who with Des Moines labor attorney
James Rogers headed the College’s
negotiating team, said that the main
feature of the new pact was a 15¢
per year across the board wage in-
crease for all the workers (except
for beginning workers who have not
yet completed their six months pro-
bationary period),

Negotiations leadingto the new con-
tract began in early June, well be»
fore the old pact expired on June
so, and continued on a weekly or
twice weekly basis throughout the
summer. Paul Neal, Business Agent
for the Des Muines basedlocalhandr
led the talks for the workers.

Issues

in addition to wages, other major
issues in the talks were the grie»
Vance procedures andeflorts to per-
lect working proceduresonthe cam-
pus. Lambie noted that there are
major ditierences between acollege
and normal industry, and that labor
contracts must take these differ-
ences into account.

One of the major ditterences is
that most cleaning operations at the
college must take place alterehours
"usually between midnight and Six
AM. Since this is not a particularly
desirable shift, this must be taken
into account in planning a new pact.
Lambie added that major efforts
had been made during the talks to
refine the situation to make it more
workable tor everyone.

New Contract Signed

Wages

College attorneys believe that the
new wage increases (and increases
in the pension fund and Social Se-
curity benefits which result from
them) are well within the 5.5%
guidelines set forth by President
Nixon‘s Wage Board.

The new pay scales range from
$215 per hour for a Goundsman III
to $335 per hour for a Mechanicl
On July 1 of l973, an additional
15¢ per hour will be added to those
tigures, making the pay range $2.30
- $3.70 per hour,

In addition, Physical Plant ems
ployees are entitled to the educa-
tional benefits and other privileges
reserved iormembers oithecbllege
community—tree admission to Col-
lege events andfacilities, remission
of tuition lor their dependents, Blue
Cross and Blue Shield coverage,and
a physical examination once every
two years.

Point of Contention

Apparently the only real point of
disagreement remaining after the
pact's ratiﬁcation is the four stage
grievance procedure built into the
contract.

Brieﬂy, the procedure allows any
worker who feels he hasagrievance
to appeal his grievance, by stages,
through the administration to Pres-
ident Leggett, if the “aggreived”
is still dissatisfied, he may request
that anoutsidearbitratorbe appointe
ed, with the union and the College
sharing equally in the cost. ,

Some union members have felt
that the process did not do the job
it was created to do. A particular
rase. which just went through the

process. involved the issue of sens
iority versus judgement of overall
competence in a promotion.

Lambie feels that in cases such as
this, involving two individuals come
peting for the same position, there
is bound to be one who will be
dissatisfied Thus, he has concluded
that the system is being blamed be—
cause, for one side or the other,
the desired result was notachleved

Union Steward Keith Arthur,
reached by telephone at his home,
told the SELB that he had not yet
seen the final version of the cons
tract. He added, howeverthntex'cept
for the across the board raise, the
other major changes in the Contract
”don’t amount to much.”

Beyond that, he told the son that
he would rather not comlnent on
the new contract until he hzid seen
it and the new Employee Handbook
which would accompany it.

Expiration Date

Terms oi the agreement call for
a June 30, 1574 expiration date.
Lamhie admits that the choice of
an early summer date was no
accident. Any strike which might
arise from contract negotiations
would not involve students at this
time of year, and, in Lambie’s
words, “. . .would do the least
amount of damage to the college
generally."i

John c. Neubauer, 24-yearrold
Executive Director at the Iowa
Students Public Interest Re
search Group (lSPlRG) will
make a speaking appearance on
campus at 4:00 p.m. on Monday,
September ll in the South

Lounge.

College Still Involved
In PE Contractor Suit

by David Nicolai
Grinnell College andGilbertEuild~
ers of Iowa Falls, Iowa, the prime

contractor forthe college’s vr mm.
plex, were named as co—defendants

in a law suit filed early this year by
RM. Boggs Company or Iowa City,
Boggs Co,, the subcontractor in
charge of the mechanical aspects
of construction, is suing the coder
fendants for $96,050 51, claiming
that it Suffered increased costs due
to delays in construction.

The contract Signed between Grin—
hell and Gilbert Bros. specified that
the complex was to be completed
within 630 calendar days after work
began in October, 1968, Work was
not Completed, however, until Nov-
ember, l97l, or approximately fit»
teen months after the agreed deadr
line

Boggs Company contends that this
delay, which it attributes tothe fails
ure of Gilbert Bros, to coordinate
properly work on the complex, re-
sulted in increased wages, increased
material costs, and an inability to
employ their manpower on the pro-

]ect in an efficient, economical man-
ner None oi the delays were caused
by mayor strikes or late deliveries
of materials; however, bad weather
did account for some of the delay,
Grinnell was probably included in
the suit only to prevent Gilbert Eros.
from “passing the buck" to the col-
lege in any iuture legal litigations.
Mr. Donald W, Lambie, the col-
lege‘s Treasurer and Vice-Presr
ident for Business, explained thathe
and other mmbers of the Grinnell
administration do not feel that the
college is at all responsiblefor Bogg
C035 losses. Although he does think
that the crews working on the com—
plex were too small and that little
was done by Gilbert pros, to com~
pensate for accidental delays, Mr.
Lambie still feels that the college’s
obligation lies with Gilbert Bros.

Mr. Lambie expressed hope that
the two companies will be able to
resolve the conflict outside court,
The college has already made some
unsuccesstul attempts to bring the
two parties together for negotia—
tions,

Pub Becomes Possibility

by Merry Wiesner

John F Bierman ill, the college’s
legal counsel, brought out several
details this week which may make
the opening of a college pub in the
private Dining Room under theQuad
possible These relate specifically
to a clause in the original will of
J B. Grinnell involving transfer oi
the land.

In a letter addressed to President
Leggelt dated Septembero, Bierman
noted:

“In consideration of the consequ-
ences of the college's sale of ale
choholic beverages or the mere
allowance of the same by others,
we had discussed the difficulties
presented by our town’s founder,
J. B. Grinnell, who generally in»
sisted that no intoxicating drinks be
sold as beverages in his town. Tc
effect his purpose, he quite oiten
transferred his lands to others only
alter having provided that the pro:
party should revert to himself oi
his heirs if intoxicating drinks were
ever sold on said properties.

“Even though there are lowa sta»
tutes and cases which wouldseemto
eliminate the difficulties of ancient
reverter clauses, it IS possible that
an heir of J B. Grinnell might at-
tempt to challenge the ownership or
Grinnell College, knowing that the
victory, no matter how slight, could
mean a mayor windtall. in my per-
sonal opinion, however, it is unr
likely that the sale of alchoholic
beverages on campus will precipi-
tate a lawsuit against the College
challenging its ownership and it is
extremely unlikely that if such a
lawsuit were brought, the College
would lose the same,

“You should note that the diffir

When you gotta go
Get to know

culties of a reverter clause pre-
sumes its existence in the chain
of title to college property, ln an
abstract of the title, provided to me
by Bob Anderson of the Business
Office, to ‘Mears Cottage and Lower
Part of Womens Dormitories’ﬁx-
tending from Mears up through
James’l there appear to be no re-
strictions whatever on the use ofthe
property acquired by the College.

As to other lands owned by the
College, the existence of a reverter
clause could be determined only
after further investigation."

It looks, therefore, like J, B.
Grinnell's desires to keep the town
and campus dry may possibly be
overcome, but the student body will
make the real decision on the ass
tabllshment of a pub at a forthr
coming referendum. The final de
cisiun as to location will be up to
the Student Services Committee.
