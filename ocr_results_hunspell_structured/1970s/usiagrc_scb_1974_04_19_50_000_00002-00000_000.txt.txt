Panel Resigns, Cries AAUP ing.

by John Wylie

All four members of the fact—find-
ing panel appointed March 6 by Fr.
esident Glenn Leggett to investigate
charges brought by the Concerned
Black Siudents (CBS) against J. Ri-
chard Woodwortli and Anne R, Abler
offered their resignations at Mon.
day’s meeting of the faculty.

in a letter to Leggett which was
read at the meeting, committee
chairman Joseph F. Wall and mom.
bers Alan R. Jones, Ronald J. Kur—
tz, and Cecil w. Lytle also urged
that the panel be disbanded.

Alive

The committee members said they
could no longer continue to Conduct
the informal investigation into the
substance and validity of the char—
ges to which they had been assigned
because officials of the American
Association of University Profes—
sors had demanded the right ol‘an
AAUP observer to participate, and

had asked that adversary procedures
be adopted by the com i'nec.
According to the letter, charges
were presented to the committee
March 18 by CBS ofﬁcials, andin.
dividuai interviews began March 21.

Following SpringBreak, interviews
were resumed April 1. CBS repre-
sentatives appearcdbcrorc the Com»,
mittee without legal counsel,tllelet-
ter said, while Abler and Woodworth
were represented by a Des Moines
attorney, Lawrence Pope.

Ahler said Monday, "after speak-
ing with senior professors at the
college, it was suggested that we
contact the AM]? .. which wedid."

Wall said he received atelephone
call lrom Mary Winslow of the stoic
AAUP office requesting permission
to attend all future committee inter-
viewing sessions.

Well] said he told Winslow that
this would be impossible unless
her participation as an adviser to
the person being interviewed were
requested.

On April 3, Winslow attended a
committee session as an advisor
to Abler and Woodworth in addi—
tion to Pope, their private conn—
sel.

Letter

A subsequent letter lrom Wins-
low to Leggett repeated the request
that she be admitted to all future
committee imcrvlews as an obser-
ver.

Both Leggett and Wall discussed
the issue with the tllenspresident
of the Iowa AAUP, Arthur Ryman of
Des Moines. Hyman maintained that,
under AAUP policy, the committee
interviews in the Abler»Woodworth~
CBS matterconstitutedformal hear-
ings, which would require the pre-
sence of an AAUF observer and a
representative of both parties tothe
dispute at each committee session.

Members of the com'nlttee main-
tained that their interviews were

part of preliminary investigation to
determine the substance of the CBS
charges and determine whether for-
mal presidential actionwas Warran-

t d.
e Violation?

Committee members concluded
that “under these circumstances
any recommendation that we mi-
ght make to you (Leggeit) would be
in violation of this interpretation
of AAUF procedures...vnder these
circumstances ourinvestigative eff.
arts become either meaningless or
a potential cause for censure by the
AAUP.

The committee members saidth'dt,
unless given orders to do other.
wide, they plan to dispose of all
the information they have acquired
“in compliance with the wishes of
the person giving thatinformation."

They added that they plan to make
no recommendations in the presi-
dent.

Leggett

President Glenn Legget‘t said Mc-n-
day that he considered the situation
serious and Wished to have time to
think about it. He added Wednesday
that he is Still considering options

Committee members said thatth»
eir decision to resign was made
with regret. They saidthat, although
their task was a difﬁcult one, they

Courtesy Cab Company

Regains license

Grinnell’s Courtesy Cab Company
had its license suspended, then rein-
stated before the suspensionbecame
effective, in a misunde rstandingwith
the City of Grinnell over the ade»
qliacy of the film’s insurance cover
age.

Grinnell’s City council Voted 5 to
1 Monday evening to suspend the
company’s license to operate ioll~
owing the failure of the firm to
produce a certiﬁcate of insurance
coverage mollested by city officials.

City Manager Ted Clausen saidthat
Grinnell’s City Code requires that
any licensed taxi must carry insur-
ance Coverage for the protection
of its passenge rs.

Ciausen met Tuesday With Mrs.‘

to Operate

Harold Thompson, an official of
the taxi firm. Mrs. Thompson pro~
duced a Cancelled check, written
to the Anania insurance Agency of
Des Mllines.

Clausen said he called the agency
and was assured that a policy for
the cab company had been issued.
On that basis, he said, the Courr
tesy Cab Company's operating ll»
Cense was reinstated. The firm’s
operations were not affected by the
short-lived misunderstanding.

Clausen said the company would
continue to operate normally un-
less “written confirmation” of Tu-
esday’s telephoned assurance fails
to reach the city offices “Within
a reasonable length of time.”
