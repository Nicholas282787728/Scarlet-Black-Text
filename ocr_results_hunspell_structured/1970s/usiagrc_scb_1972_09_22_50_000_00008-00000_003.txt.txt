Daily Blues (for Bilie

li bees so hard

when ya wake up in

the mornln

and its still quite dark

outside

though the sun be shinin bright
.....Somewhere ,,,,,

when iaucets blow air

and you gotta cry to wash

the night's sleep awzly.

last night

Cold hard lloors

no covers hut my man

I tossed and turned the whole time.
I sing sometimes

when l'm down and out

alone and hurt

the bitterebitter blues.
ummmmmmhaoy ummmmmmoahy
ain't no limes like

hard times

ain’t no way but dark ways,

Bread and water
heans and rise

taste so good when salt tears
season them

I crys a lot when the day

is long.

Crowded halls/dingy walls
close in on ya

till you got to light

to breath the no good air,

it oees so sad when ya
climb the stairs to empty
rooms where your lootsteps
cream lettin you know

ain’t nobody there to hold
ya and wipe away the sweat

a young girl sits in thy chair
her dark hair rolls long and gently down
it is parted to the side

Sometimes I leels like nobody’s
Chile (i hear my mama callln my
name hut she been long gone)
so I kneels with tolded palms

outside the quiet wind with
tilted head prayin for a Way.

Alone she came {Iglow in virgin white,
A single star that soitly lit the night;
Bearing the cruel hope of innocence
That made hel‘ seek her Kissing Princet
“Though thou art til-ave," 1 said, "to seek this sight,
Your Kissing Prince, 1 fear, has taken liiglli
No man can stay long in this harren liind
OI prickly plants. cold rocks and desert snnd."
Hui she yust smiled and slyly said to me,
“You don’t understand what story l'm irolli
You’re oi the desert Lind 1 Cl the sen,
it is for you Alone (till I have come."
And then slll‘ Shed hu‘ robes of Virgin White.
Becoming one with the hlue of the night,
