Learning a

the hard way

Breakfast last Friday was
disturbed by students passing our
ilyers which explained the reasons
for if; students taking up tclnr
porary residence in Nollen house.
Mimicking the opening lines of the
constitution. the stalement ch
pressed a desire tor a “just and
equitable otter towards the set»
tlementof the strike“. it also modc
clear that the students would not
depart until such an offer had been
made.

Corn ﬂakes went soggy as
unreceptive students quietly
listened to the volunteers. it was
obvious that the latest student
effort at collecting support for
immediate settlement of the Elm
strike was a failure.

Word was relayed to the Grinnell
16, and threat of suspension
became an overburdening price to
pay tor an action that they felt was
not even a “take over.” A much
more Constructive action took
place later on the lawn, when
curious students wandered over to
the administrative building and
shot the breeze in an informal
questionandranswer session.

do, because we must. Usually we
are left addressing bones of some
itinerant Stand-in at a rehearsal or
touching up disguise between

‘engagements. We are tempted and

taught to think that photography
hangs out backstage, waiting, time
on its hands, caught between the
curtain and the cue, always ac-
tually late, never really here lithe
suspense doesn’t kill us, irony will.
Suspension

Photographs by Lynn Lown,
“Pictures From a Floating Life,"
are on display at East Street
Gallery in Grinnell during the
month of September, individually
and in sequence these photographs
explore and expose on multiple
levels the technical and creative
[acts and acts of photography as
suspension, as transition, Lown's
linely made prints play on in
terpenetrations oi depth and
surface. Objects ﬂoat;
backgrounds recede; backgrounds
merge with foreground. Disjoinled
appendages become whole,
autonomous organs. Fragments
form new objects. Rootless things

- float toward new connections with

surrounding textures, shapes, and
planes. Lown’s sense of humor and
composition frees pieces of
habitually familiar realities to
follow an internal logic of
association through contract,
brightness, texture, shape. or
structure. His photographs waste
no space. since they create their
own. They close on objects,
lraming parts and pieces, abs
stracting things from comfortable
contexts and habitual en»
vironments. Like the “cap of
composite order" in Flauhert’s
Madame Bovary or an ofticial's
coat in Kaika’s Trial. Lynn Lown's
images are not coverings or copies,
His photographs are visual coma
positions and aesthetic constructs
evolving from internal con»
sistencies of style.
Sepia

The twentyri'our photographs
that make up “Pictures From A
Floating Lite" have been toned in
sepia, The constant of image color
helps to unite the photographs yet
separates them from slightly olive-
drab or cool, neutral blueblack and

seeing The brown color might
remind us of photographs in an
tique shops, or those propped
scenes and faces in darkened
parlours, those vlsages, we may
remember now. that We almost
recognized when we first saw
them. The toner effects a
suspension in each print by ins
tensitying darker values. Higher
values seem elevated, image
contrast is apparently increased.
In many of Lown’s photographs
distracting detail is kept to a
minimum of hints. Objects,
shapes, and forms appear to ﬂoat
within, in front of, or on a trans
slucent or nearly opaque field. in
other photographs Lown employs
bold, yet razorsharp grain pattern
to achieve and assist visual
suspensions. Knees float against
and into sky because of the in-
terplay of grain Structure of the
image with the texture of the ob-
ject. And a grove oi trees becomes
the outline of a hill against and
within the Crisp grain of sky and
clouds. lmage tone and grain
pattern, where employed, create
literal visual images of suspension
and transition.
Waterreilections

Reﬂections verity surfaces,
which may he mirrors, but which
can become transluscent. Lynn
Lown is fascinated by water that
reflects and reveals. Immersed
parts ot a female body meet
reflections on the surface in a two»
way field that holds them both, The
initial photograph of the show
frames the reflection of bright sun
on water A Water insect floats
about two-thirds up the extreme
left edge oi the prillt, anchoring
with palpable detail what other-
wise would be a boring visual
abstraction. Circular ripples of the
insects movement repeat the
shape ot the sun’s reﬂection and
intersect other circular patterns of
ripples, presumably caused by the
wind or the shore. Lown's coma
positional boldness in exploring the
perimeters of the image make this
photograph visually taut; an
improbable balance of surface
object and reflection creates
energy in an otherwise static
pattern, in general Lown‘s
photographs are ‘boldly and cun-

ningly. it not playfully composed.
He extends and even violates the
familiar compositional law of
thirds He explores the rims of
things. Headless female '
water; a woman lookin ,
camera,her face cut of! st above; "
the eyes. an open-mouthed mon-
ster painted on her shirt; legs
standingin a field of delicate water
plants; or legs hanging against a
sandy beach (photographed
horizontally, but d' played Vere
tically). These di ointed ap-
pendages and the space that they
fracture not only recall what is
missing, but create new contexts
for what is there Lown’s
photographs create visual fields in

- which space must be relearned. In

reﬂections on water, trees do grow
downward toward the rock on
which the photographer stands.
Their branches become the roots
that they so closely resemble. And
if, as in one photograph, two Small
white floating ﬂowers hang near
the bottom of the print, framed by
descending branches of relfected
trees, then we may as well
acknowledge that the radiating
traces of Ophelia's hair could be
just outside our view. Surely she
sees things this way. When sur-
faces conceal and reveal. hwn they
reﬂect and transmit, when they
enclose and disclose, then What is
visualized becomes what is
visualizahle. Vision has gene, is
going visionary.
Complex webs
The most powerful image is the
final one, A headless, armless,
battered concrete statue, barely
recognizable as a female figure,
Stands in a dark lield. the moon
where a head should be. Loops of
Wire around the waist tie the form
to the corners and to the bottom of
the print, in general the twenty-
lhree preceding photographs have
moved through literal and'
figurative complexes of sun,
water, wind. and earth. On difr
ferent levels the movement goes
from abstract to concrete. from
light to darkness; from reﬂection
to Shadow, from energy to matter.
As a whole the show presents
complex webs of linear Vertical
associations. Each image creates‘
