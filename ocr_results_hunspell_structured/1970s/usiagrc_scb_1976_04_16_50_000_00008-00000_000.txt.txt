the way. Pcnn took 2-0 lead in the
fourth inning when two men came
home on a sacrifice fly. Ordinarily
two runs scored on a sacrifice fly
would indicate shoddy defensive
play, but in this particular instance
Penn should have scored three
runs Left fielder Tom Guetz
stretched way over the fence to
make a miraculous catch, robbing
the Penn batter of a homerun. In
the process he became entangled
with the fence and could not ex-
tricate himself In time to stop the

Taylor Invitational to open the

Simpson (25), Iowa Wesleyan m),
and Cornell (31). but placed them
well behind host William Penn’s 65
points and winner Central
College's 92 points.

Lincoln Marshall led the

Coach Mo Hunt was somewhat
encouraged with the team’s per»
lormance in the meet, and was
”pleased with third place with
What we have." He thinks the team
generally showed improvement
over last Saturday’s season
opener, despite the relatively short
threerday rest.

What is of consequence for Ilunt
is that the performers are nearing
their potentials, especially the field
men. ”They are giving me 100 per
cent." noted Hunt, “and that's
important." Hunt expects his
Pioneers to do well next week ill
the Central Invitational as vir~
tually the Same teams will be
present. “I am very pleased with
Nadalsky and Marshall,” Hunt
said. "Leech is coming along, and
Bolesta is starting to get some
confidence. Davis is getting better i
each time he runs.” he added,
