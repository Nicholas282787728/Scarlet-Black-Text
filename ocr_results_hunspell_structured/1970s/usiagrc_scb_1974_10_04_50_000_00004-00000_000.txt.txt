The'T. V. 'of T. V.Learson

by Hilary Siebcrt

What could be more ironic than
’I‘. V. Learsoll‘s vision of social
progress as ”training just one
foreigner who knows nothing to
repair tclcr .ion sets”?

I believe that the man is a
genius He has learned the divine
nrt ot Greek gods. that or changing
his physical iorin. As matter
changes form and yet remains
constant, so T V. Leai‘son has
transformed himself from a TV, to
a 'l‘,V Leai'son, Belore us We have
Tv.‘s rcality. which we can ac-
cept, laugh at, or turn away irom
We can turn Mr, Learson off, Yet
he Is still there, in the air We can
turn on our receivers, While they
are still ours to turn on, and we can
tune in: and there is T V. Learson
within his Irame. which is also our
irame oi perception as we watch
him, When I try to break his frame,

, inn longer receive a signal, though
he is still broadcasting. What is
wrong with my receiver? Could it
be that if you break the frame of a
T.V. it no longer works?

But it is alright: there are plenty
of other receivers who can tune
him in on all channels‘

On channel 3 has giving jobs to
the poor ignorant Chileans: they
are learning how to push buttons,

0n channel 5 he’s training
hungry Africans to build factories
to produce capital to research new
ways oi making more and better
food, computerized iood, to make
these unfurtunates’ lives happy,
rather than short and brutish.

Channel 7 has a training
program for any respectable
Vietnamese who wishes to better
himself by learning to build a
computer that periorms
“protection reaction raids”
against “military installations”
with “remotercontrolled perr
sonnell devices” that can be
triggered “with honor” irom
Washington. in a touching scene,
the white-faced technician and the
little brown man work arm in arm.
They understand each other’s
needs and wants. The whitish man
gives the brownish man money to
help him live better, and to help
him destroy the rice fields, The

brownish man’s bluergrcen
daughter has no iiclds to work in,
and realizing the whitish man's
needs, accepts his money ior hcr
lavors “Everything great in
America, yes?" shc says,

On channel to there is a

it. We do not force it on them. They

butter, it they want it; only crazy

0n channel l2, trail-bikes are

Suddenly my receiver is on

Gallo brothers present defense

Ed. note—Tile tollowiiig letter “as
sent to Pres. Leggctt by Ernest
Gallo, partner in E. and i. Gnllo
Winery in Modesto, CA. We feel
that it presents is an interesting
iicwpoint and is worth printing
hcre.

Dear Mr. Leggett:

My brother, Julio, and i are
distressed by the position taken by
some religious groups on the
Jurisdictional dispute between the
United Farm Workers of America
and the Teamsters Union. This
dispute has escalated to include
boycotting of Gallo products, and
some UFW boycott committees
throughout the nation have
resorted to false statements about
our company in their ciiorts to gain
sympathy and support

Untortunately, as it has turned
out, we did not take iirm steps to
refute these falsehoods and
distortions of the truth as soon as
they began to be circulated. We
know Cesar Chavez to be a man
with honorable motives and we
have held him in high regard,
personally. We also know that he
has encountered many difficulties
administratively in developing his
young union We gladly give him

facilities and every possible
assistance when he represented
our ranch employees from 1957 to
1973, for we share his beliefs in the
rights of iarm workers and his
aspirations to better their lives.

We realized that the im-
ilammatory statements originated
with the zealots in the various
committees and trusted that (1) it
was another administrative
problem and would be corrected
internally by the executive level oi
the UFW and t2) the statements
were so patently lies, distortions,
and exaggerations that few would
believe them,

We now believe that we have
turned the other cheek long
enough. It appears that a number
oi religious groups have endorsed a
boycott of all Gallo products in the
sincere but mistaken belief that we
are cruel and inhuman exploiters
of farm workers and their families.
Further, many supply an en
dorsement without inquiring about
the facts; and many supply an
endorsement of the lettuce and
grape boycott only to learn later
that they are also being credited
with an endorsement of the Gallo
boycott.

i will tell you quite frankly that

Gay community supported

To the Editor:

Ted Price’s column oi Sep
tember 27 entitled “Left-Handed
Perspective” is an insult to the
sensibilities oi the Grinnell
Community. Apparently an at
tempt at satire on ”Gay Per
spectives". lur. Price’s article
displays the same irresponsible
attitude that spawned the “NBC
Manifesto” ot three years ago and
the “White Martyrs” episode of
last semester. This attitude fails to

ACES SK Sl’.\(' S

distinguish between cheap locker
room humor and the intellectual
integrity hopefully required oi
those who columiiize tor the
Scarlet and Black. Such a display
oi emotional immaturity does not
Warrant the continuation of Mr
Price’s Vista column, where his
abuse oi the pen can only serve to
turthur polal'ize the various
elements oi the Campus Coins

this had been a saddening and
disilllisioning experience for my
brother and me. Because we have
honored and respected the wishes
of our iarm workers to change
unions, we have been caught in the
middle of a jurisdictional dispute
between the two unions. This in
turn has subjected us to vilitication
and character assassination, if
there is any moral justification for
this, we are at a loss to find it.

I am enclosing a pamphlet and a
few articles which I know you will
read with an open mind, Then, if
you have any questions at all about
any area of this dispute, I would
appreciate your writing to me and -
allowing me to answer your
questions in complete detail.

Very truly yours,

Students at home
in London

To the Editor:

The theme of Grinnell-in-London
seems to be “Boy am i glad rm not
in Grinnell this semester." We are
receiving reports at a BM} strike,
federal narcs. and suicides. Glad to
know you’re doing so well, Death
wishes for continued success.

So, what are we Grinnellians in
London doing? Everything but
studying. No, but we must revise
thatiwe do on occasion. For those
who like rock, we have about 25
choices a night including groups
like the Dead and the Band. There
is also Jazz, [olk, classical and-
opcra. Anything you want, all in
great abundance Plus there is
lnore than music Theatre,
museums, or just standing on the
street and saying “What, the luck
am I doing in London!"

Gl'innellians in London are
deiineteiy not a community. We
have never all been in one place at
the same time. Not everyone has
seen everyone else. We are all
living in separate houses all over
town Those of us in this house are
havnig a crosscllltural experience
with an Arab landlord and a
Nigerian medical student as a
roommate. Central College
students tell us they are all happy
to be living in the same hotel. We
are rcally happy that we're not.
Can you imagine living in a hotel
with is other Grinnell students.
Sounds more like Norris hall than
London

All Hi all we're having a great
time. Anyone in Gl'inliell who can
think of a reason why we should
return. please tell us because We
can‘t think of zlllyiTlio iolks at
lttl \'. ('oiiiiigluini mt. London w
