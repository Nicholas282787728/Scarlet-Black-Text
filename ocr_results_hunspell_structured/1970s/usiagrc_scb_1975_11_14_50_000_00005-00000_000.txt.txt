Article 3 of the charter of Iowa
College which opned in Davenport
in 1843 stated: “The object of this
institution shall be to promote the
general interests oi education and
to quality young men ior the dii-
ierent proiessions and ior the
honorable discharge of the various
duties of life ”

In 1859 the Trustees of Iowa
College arranged to move the
college to Gl‘innell, a newly
established town, 150 miles west.
However, the parents oi nine girls
who had completed high school
requested that their daughters be
allowed to attend the College.
Although the male students were
against the admission of females,
the trustees granted permission
and the iaculty approved the
decision.

The men who drew up the
charter tor the ncwly situated
Grinnell University provided tor
the education of women with a
“Ladies Program." The program
was patterned aitcr that at Mt.
Holyoke College and advocated by
Julia Chapin Grinnell, wife of the
founder of the town and college.

The “Ladies' Course” consisted
of basic courses in literature,
classical languages, and math, and
was described in the 1863»69
catalogue as being “designed to
give Young Ladies iaciiities for
thorough mental discipline, and for

prcparing to teach in the best High
Schools, Academies, and Female
Seminaries, as well as the other
duties of their appropriate
sphere."

Some of the ”young Ladies,”
howevcr, petitioned to take courses
that were considered essentially
masculine. One oi these, Mary E,
Snell, fulfilled the requirements for
a B.A, and in 1867 was the first
woman at Grinncll to receive that
degree From then on, any woman
dcsiring toenrollasacandidate for
the B A. degree was permitted to
do so

In 1871, women first delivered
orations at graduation as men did,
The women involved were supr
posed to read chosen essays,
however, they ignored the' in-
structions and presented orations.
The switch was ignored and the
women were given their diplomas
anyway, as it nothing had hap-
pened.

Following this incident, the
administration was much more
liberal in their inclusion of women
at graduation, although in the days
oi dress reiorm when one young
woman announced that she would
wear bloomers while delivering
her oration, the president oi the
college arranged to have the
rostrum lined with shrubs and
plants, when she rose from her
seat on the platiorm to speak, no
one was aware oi her “daring
costume.”

Although the laws governing the
students at Grinnell are now very
liberal, in the early days oi the
college they were qulte strict,
especially ior women, Demerits
were given to young ladies for
Walking half a block with a man
she might meet on the street. even
though he was an elderly
acquaintance

With the construction of dor-
mitories in 1915 and 1916 new ad-
ministrative rules were made. The
“Women’s Quadrangle,“ now
called South Campus, was built to
house the women and a year later
the men's dorms were built
Women were initially allowed to
have “gentlemen callers," in Main
Lounge, but only on Saturday
afternoons until five. The times
were later extended to include
Sunday.

These rules did become much
less stringent in time; itis reported
in the October 15. 1927 issue of The
Scarlet and Black that “today’s
coed" unlike those in 1860, often
climbed into her bed at 12:40 a in
after a date and two hours of
cramming. ‘

Dates were supposed to end
early and the administration had
picket iences put up to keep coeds
irom using iire escapes when
returning from dates after ap-
proved hours. In 1929 a more efr
lective device was implemented to
prevent late-night dating, Ac-

cording to the 1929 Des Moines
Register. “An electrical device has
been installed on the fire escape of
at least one local sorority house
which sounds a loud buzzer in the
basement whenever there is a
iootstep on the iron stairs,”

According to the Register,
although the expressed purpose oi
the devices was to protect women
irom “Peeping Toms,” “the girls
have their suspicions that It has
other uses, however, for even a
dainty iemininc tread on the iire
escape sounds the buzzer,” Women
were not completely irce oi
restrictive hours until 1967 when
“women’s hours” were iinally
eliminated.

Women have always played a
major role at Grinnell. Women
have been important members oi
the faculty from the college’s
iounding, Many women's
organizations such as the Women‘s
Athletic Association, The Women's
Self-Governing League, and the
Ladies’ Education Society, which
provided loans for women
preparing for teaching or
missionary work, were iounded
before 1912

During the Ci '1 War and the two
world wars, it was the female
students who kept the college
running The initiative of the
women at Grinncll has been and
will continue to be a significant
factor in the college’s history

Health care receives attention
Study for publication ‘

by Kate Waldo

In a low weeks a “Sexuality
Health Care Resources" list will be
published under the sponsorship oi
the Sexuality Resource Group, The
list covers the gynecological
services available to Grinncll
women as weil as the prices
charged at each iaciiity. The
listing was compiled through
personal and telephone interviews
with local doctors and clinics in the
surrounding area It will hopeiully
provide a considerable amount oi
important iniormation ior both
men and women at Grinltell.

The publication of such a list
raises some important issues for
Grinncll women to consider when
looking at gynecological services
available to them, Many women
feel that if they could solve the
problem oi transportation or ii
Grinncll had a resident
gynecologist, then their problems
in obtaining quality care would be
solved. But, even it every woman
on campus had a car, or ii Grinnell
had three gynecologists, many oi
the problems would still remain.

The problem of getting com-
petent, responsive gynecological
carc involves not only the number
or prosimity oi medical services,
but also many women’s own at-
titudes and behavior. Even
seemingly assertive and iorceiui
women in every other situation
oiten appear to become “little
girls” again whcn they enter the
inner sanctum of the doctor’seot-
fice, They lose their ability to
critically analyze what is going on
and they place their minds and
bodies totally in the hands of the
ailcknowing “expert” healer,

They begin to distrust their own
knowledge of their bodies and their
own perceptions oi what is hap-
pening, They cease to question the
need, the appropriateness, and the
prices of treatment offered by the
‘l‘expe ” The- , apparently
authoritarian and insensitive at-

titudes displayed by many doctors
oiten is simply a response to the
void left by the woman’s
unassertive and uncritical
behavior In the doctor’s office,

Women must begin to take more
responsibility for their health care
in at least two directions. First, We
must gain more knowledge oi our
own bodies and the effects of
treatments offered by the medical
proiession. We need not go to
medical school ior seven years to
learn gynecological self»
examination or to know what
methods of birth control are the
healthiest ior us. Next, we must
become more assertive and
demanding oi quality health care
from those involved in the delivery
of medical services,

When we speak oi “quality
health care" we mean more than
simply competent medical
practice We mean health care
which actively involves the
woman, which is educational and
which is preventative. Quality
health care puts the health of the
woman involved as the top priority
(as opposed to priorities such as
what is convenient for the doctor or
What “seems to work for other
girls”).

The doctors and clinics covered
in the ”Sexuality Health Care
Resources” will not all offer health
care which actively involves the
woman, which is educational and
which is preventative. But if
Grinncll women will take a more
critical and “consumeroriented”
attitude, as well as increasing their
knowledge oi gynecological issues,
many of the doctors and clinics will
become much more responsive.
Asking questions, demanding
answers, accepting the responc
sibility ior making decisions in-
volving our health, and helping
other women to do the same will go
a long way toward improvmg the
qualityof. care received.

Woman to Woman, by Luciclille
Lansoil. Mn,

by Katherine Kramer

At last a iemale gynecologist,
Lucienne Lanson, M.D.,
F.A.C.0.G., has written an
authoritative book on Women's
health. Dr, Lanson successfully
combines the knowledge and ex
perience ol the practicing
gynecologist with a direct un.
derstading oi the way women iecl
about the femal aspects of their
bodies,

For years the science oi
gynecology has been a mystery to
women. Male doctors dominate
the iield and until recently were
rarely qustioncd about their
practice by their patients. The
women's movement and theory of
seli-help have inspired women to
discover more about their own
bodily functions. The number of
female gynecologists remains low
but women are increasingly
becoming self-educated and
demanding answers and ex
planations irom their male doc-
tors.

Many women are beginning to
learn the right questions to ask the
doctor and are becoming com-
lotable in their knowledge of their
own bodies. Books such as Our
Bodies Ourselves advancedea
women’s pride in and knowledge oi
her own body greatly. From
Woman to Woman is a positive
building block in the expanding
field of women's health.

Dr, Lanson first examines the
anatomy oi the female; she bluntly
titles this section “The Women's
Departmentiwhat You Have and
What It’s There For." The specific
function of menstruation is
discussed in detail in Section Two.
Dr. Lanson speaks to the normal
questions of cramps, menstrual
irregularity and tension, and the

. doctor's role in controlling menc

struai problems,

Later in the book a detailed
discussion oi menopause is
presented Day to day problems
such as infections, odors, and
irritations are explained and
suggested remedies are given. The
very important area oi veneral
disease receives a good amount oi
space and attention

Dr. Lanson spends much time on
the reproductive aspects of the
female anatomy. The complete
cycle of pregnancy is not explained
in detail, only in terms of “How to
Become Pregnant and How to
Avoid Pregnancy.”

A brief discussion of “In»
tercourse and Other Sexual Ac-
tivities” presents the subject to us
from a Women’s perspective. This
one chapter will not replace any oi
the sex manuals that have ap~
peared on the market recently,
because of its lack of detail.

A prediction of women’s health
of tomorrow and an excellent
glossary round out this thorough
study.

Even though the style is easy and
low key, Dr. Lanson impresses her
readers with the seriousness of the
subject} matter. The format is
question and answervand many oi
the questions are those which
women have been afraid to ask out
loud

Finally, the book helps a Woman
sort out information she thought
she already knew. Dr. Lanson is
qualified not only by her medical
degree but by her sensitivity
toward the subject matter, The
book can he skimmed and quickly
read, used ior reierence, ior minor
problems and before doctor's
appointments, and ior answering
large questions about a little-
known areas,
