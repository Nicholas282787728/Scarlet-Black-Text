College President A Richard
Turner ruled out rehiring either
Georgia Denlel or Kathy Mc-
Cluskey in tront oi approximately
500 students at the Student
Government Association's open
forum on administrative
reorganization.

Turner said that, despite the

gieelings oi the students, he would

not reconsider his decision to
combine the current positions of
Dentel, McCluskey and Tom
Latimer under Latimer's

’jurisdiction. Further, in answer to

a question posed by Dave Arnold
concerning future student input in
Similar situations, a negative

but other cabinet members ex
pressed serious doubts as to the
viability of this option.

Turner denied that the dismissal
of Dental, McCluskey and Dean of
the Curriculum Mary Eyscnbach
had Sexist motivations, but he
rejected Andy MCKibben’s
demand that affirmative action
programs be instituted and eln'
ployment requirements lowered in
order to raise the number 01
women and blacks employed here.

At the beginning of the question
and answer period Turner was
presented at the meeting with
three petitions and over 00 letters
from concerned students which

response triggered a walk-out by
about One-third of the students
attending the meeting,

Despite this position, two
alternatives regarding Dentcl
were proposed that Turner refused
to rule out. One plan, ofiered by
ireshman Scott Sobel, proposed
that Dentel be re-hired, and Cons
tracted, to book for other colleges
in the ACM. The other alternative
was to have SGA hire Dentel. SGA
President Ruth Montgomery said
this possibility will be considered,

were collected by an unofficial
student group headed by senior
Rick Peterson. The petitions dealt
with the issues of affirmative
action, student voice in the
allocation of student monies, and
misgivings concerning the con-
tinuing quality oi the recreation
and social activities at Grinnell.
The meeting opened with
statements from Turner, Monr
tgomery, SGA social coordinator

Open forum:

Program, and Andy McKlbben
irom Cultural and Political House,
Turner, speaking iirst, admitted
that. he was “not comlortable” to
be at the meeting, and spoke
primarily to the issues of
educational priorities and financial
limitations. Claiming that the
reorganization would save the
School $62,000 each year, Turner
said the move was an eitort on the
part of the administration to get
the college to live “within its
means."

Montgomery addressed the
question of student involvement in
a decision aliectlng students,
stating that Turner and Dean
Waldo Walker should consult with
students in these areas. She also
expressed concern that Latimer
would not be able to adequately
handle three jobs, although his
position may be justifiable
bureaucratically, “Coordination
without the programming leaves
us nowhere." she said.

Turner‘s claim that the ﬁnancial
position at the school necessitated
the dismissal oi Dentel and Mc-
Cluskey met with a twofold
argument from students, who said
that the services or the two women
serve to counteract the efiect oi the
school's undesirable geographical
location and to attract students,

‘anpd therefore money, to the

college, in addition, many students
asserted that Turner’s decision
was essentially uniair, since both
McCluskey and Dentel give expert
advice in the expenditure of
student activity iees.

As the walkout indicated.
students were generally unhappy
with the proceedings, Montgomery
expressed ambivalent feelings on
the iorurn aiterwards, “In some
senses I don't think there could
have been a satisiactory result. 1
think the students’ points were
made, and many valid points were
made that were not effectively
answered, but I hope that this will
show the administration that
student input in decisions aiiecting
student life is necessary to develop
a community oi trust." she said

Like Montgomery, Peterson was
pleased with the student response
“I think it’s been a very valuable
experience for both the people who
worked and [or the students. It's
gratifying to know that students
aren't completely apathetic, and
that they will respond readily to a
situation that directly affects
them. Also, in the future, when the
administration Considers student
related matters, matters which
directly relate to student Welfare,
it will try to get more student input
instead of arbitrarily dictating
What is right. I think the decision
this summer set a dangerous
precedent.”

The mood:

Wednesday, September 22, 1976,
is destined to iind its place among
some oi the truly great individual
days in Grinnell College history.

held in the South Lounge oi the
Forum.

For the iirst time, in what I
expecthas been a long time, nearly
half of the student body par-
ticipated in an event which did not
feature the quantative con-
sumption oibeer. Truly vital issues
were in question at the open forum.
Namely, how should a liberal arts
college's iiscal belt-tightening
affect its ”committment" to a
student-oriented participatory
democracy? Where is the decision-
making line drawn? Rhetoric and

opinions. Never was there any
pretense of altering the decision as
it stood. Unfortunately, a good
many oi the participating students
did not acknowledge this fact.
Policy alterations suggestions
were lined at the President and
his second banana (Dean
Walker), with speed enough to
make even the most gifted of art
historians quake at their call»

Briefly, the administration's
position is that liberal arts colleges
are the victims of rising iniiation,
stagilation, depression, other
economic maladies (and perhaps
even the dreaded swine flu). The
college's survival depends upon
cash flow and expenditures. The
administration hopes to lighten the
school's economic plight and build
a very workable and responsible
bureaucracy. There is no lack oi
regret about having to “ter-
