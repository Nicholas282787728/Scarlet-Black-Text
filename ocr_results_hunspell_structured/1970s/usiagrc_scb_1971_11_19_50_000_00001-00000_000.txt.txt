Nader’s Raider

Reveals Career
As Nuisance

by Ted Grippo

‘ Mr. Harrison Wellford, one of the
original ”Nader’s Raiders" arrived
on campus Wednesday, November
17th and presented the college and
surrounding community with many
interesting tacets oihis organization

"the Center tor Responsive Law.
In the afternoon he conductedadls-
cussion in the South Lounge ol the
Forum, speaking mainly oi oppor—
tunities for Careers in the Public
interest Movement. He began his
talk with a brief recount of his own
college days when he was very une
certain of what his Career wouldbe.
He then described the Public Inter-
est Movement as twelve organiza—
tions around the country with atotal
of about 200 people working full—
time. It is supported by about six
small foundations, public donations
and a grant from the Ford foundation.
He painted what he called agrirn but
honest picture of the long hours and
small salaries in his organization
and he emphasized the need forreal
commitment to this kind of work

In his own branch of the movement
there are at present 37 protessione
als of all walks oi life, noneoiwhom
are paid over $14,000 per year. He
explained the need for people irom
almost every discipline, including
such areas as the sciences, law,
economics and political science.

Next Mr. Welliord described 06,
cupations in organizations parallel
to the one in which he works. Some
Senate committees, he said, provide
the opportunity lor work in the public
interest, but the case is often that
the superiors at these committees
are obligated in one way or another
to some group with a partisan
interest and thus, since much of
the lindings never get past the
superiors. the work is not very
fruitful.

Another type oi organization to be
Considered is the student sponsored
interest groups, These groups are
financed by interested students and

News Analysis

Initiative Fund

Appropriations

by Chip snotstall

Last week 1 submitted ior public scrutiny a briei report on the tunding
activities or the initiative-Cultural rund tor the iirst hall oi this semester.
Since that report I have had several people express an interest in securing
a more speciiic report on the nature oi the committee's appropriations
’This report will not only describe in more detail past appropriations, hut
will present two major plans tor the coming weeks.

in the category or speakers and iilmsthecommittee has appropriated $725.
in the realm oi speakers, the committee has allotted tunds to prolessor Don
Smith in the history department for securing theservices oi Protessor A. J.
Plumb from Cambridge University. He will ccmetoorinnell early next year.
Three speakers irom the Concerned AsianScholars werehrought to Grinnell
in conjunction with the China Symposium. Elizabeth Nail, sociologist, was
iinanced with initiative-Cultural iund money. A Hungarian economist and
“expert socialist” will morethanlikelybe on campus for a law days in early
December as a result olthe committee's appropriation The committee voted
to partially iinance the visit oi the pre-eminent Russian poet, Andre
Vesnezensky, although later complications prevented his appearance.
The film The East is Red was obtained through the mud,

it should he noted that the lunding oi a speaker is done primarily with the
stipulation that he will deliver an all—campus lecture. This is in keeping with
the committee's policy oi ”the best tor the most,”

in the area of small group projects, the committee has spent only $35 This
is in some ways untortunate and unexpected, Committee members ielt that
not only was there a need for small group proyects, but that the need would
be quickly maniiested in a large number oi applications. Perhaps this is a
reﬂection on the lack or leisure time people have had this semester. Hopee
fully, next semester people will be able to iind the time to use their imagi-
nation in developing meaningiul projects.

the postage was coming lrom the
same source.

Roger w. Showley, in a November
5 letter to the 5&8 admitted that all
production, mailing, and computer
costs oi The White House mailings
were paid by the Republican Na-
tional Committee (RNC), but denied
any inconsistencies in this.

“Like all other federal agencies,
the White House tries to CDITlmunJr
cate directly with the media and
various types or groups, But iole
lowing the President’s own direce
tive that expenditures ofpublic tunds
[or public relations and information
be kept to a minimum, the White
House Communications Ofllce does
not have the budget to produce and
mail its iniormation packets; it
should be noted, also, that theWhite
House does not enjoy the franking
privilege lor free mail given to
members oi Congress and Federal
agencies. Consequently, theRepube
lican Party has taken on the respon»
sibility tor disseminating White
House mailings at no cost to the
taxpayer. Without GOP support this
material would still be produced,
but would not reach nearly as many
Americans.”

No Direct Answer

Mr Showleydidnotdlrectlyanswer
the SKtB’s question, “Are these (the
White House mailings mentioned
above) oiliclal communications of
the Executive Branch oi the governs
merit, or are they actually campaign
promotional literature prepared by
your oiiice or some other division
of the Republican National Com—
mittee”. All he would szly was that
there was no Connection other than
RNC'S payment for production,
mailing, and computer costs,

There is not yet enough inlormation
available to draw accurate conclu-
sions about the implications of this
expense sharing. However, investi-
gations are continuing, with a later
report lroin 5&8 Washington Cor-
respondent Curt Correll expected
shortly.

Gould Addresses
Phi Bele Meeting

Lawrence Gould, who has played a
leading role in scientific expeditions
to Antartica, addressed the autumn
meeting at Phi Beta Kappa last
evening

At the meeting were announced the
named oi the first six seniors to be
elected to the organizationandoltne
four sophomores who earned book
awards tor outstanding academic
work during the ireshman year.

Elected to membership were Bruce
J. Eatts, Stephen w. Grow, David
C. Humans, Andrew F. Kramer,
Gregg C, Sayre, and Winifred M.
Y, Tamura, Recipients oi the book
award were Laura J. David, De
horah M. Van Horn, and Brad E.
Vezales. David I Wright declined
to accept the book award he had
earned.

Alter the ado oi presenting certi»
iicates and envelopes to the app»
ropriate people, prolessor Moore,
English, introduced Mr. Gould's
lecture: “The World’s Greatest
Laboratory.”

Mr. Gould began with the obser»
vation that Antarctica is unique for
many reasons. It is the most iso—
lated continent on earth, the only

"Mr

one that has never been the home
of man. It is the highest continent
and has the greatest intiuence oi
any on the surrounding area oi
the globe, it is the world’s cold-
est and driest desert and thus is
the most useful natural environment
for the study oi extra-terrestrial
lite, and it is the windiest contir
nent. The continent provides an
invaluable record of climatic ch—
anges,

Current research in the region in-
cludes the drilling oi cores oi ice,
whose deposits tell a great deal of
the history of the area, and much
study of line on and around the con—
tinent,

Alter reviewing some or the re»
search being Conducted, Mr. Gould
explained the nature and the im-
portance oi the international co-
operation which pervades the scien-
tific effort there. He suggested
that the treaty that provided for
international cooperation in Antarc-
tic research, signed in the late lite
ties, may have been an important
step in thawing the Cold War, be
cause of the mutual confidence it
presupposed.
