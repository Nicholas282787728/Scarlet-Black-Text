Eject “psycho-
babble,” don’t vote

SGA President Greg Youtz last week advised presidential
candidates not to underestimate the intelligence of the
student body.

Obviously, each of the candidates has disregarded his
advice. ‘

THIS YEAR‘S “CAMPAIGN" for SGA President has
been marked by meaningless rhetoric, empty promises which
could never be fulfilled and irresponsible babble. It‘s enough ‘
to prompt fear for the future of representative democracy.

Each of the candidates, with one exception, hasspent the
past two Weeks paying homage to the shibboleth of “student
input," one of those conveniently vague phrases which
everybody approves of but no one can define.

CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, some of the statements of
Melissa Hopp, who, along with David Kramer, is in Mon-
day's run-off election. Hopp, in one of her ﬂyers, goes to
great lengths to try and convince students she is “willing to
take an assertive stance to assure full consideration of
student opinion.”

What does she mean by this? It’s not really clean But
what she means is not important. What is important is that
she acknowledged the importance of “student input.”

IN FAIRNESS, HOWEVER, Melissa’s campaign differed
very little in this respect from those of Harvey Leff or Jon

Christianson. Leff, for example, refused to
discuss specific issues but did not neglect to kow-tow in the
direction of student “input" during his bid for the
presidency.

The “campaign," however, touched bottom last Sunday
night when the candidates were interviewed on KDIC.
Perhaps'the apogee was reached when Hopp said she'd
consider leading a student strike to prevent the faculty from
bringing back the F' grade (an idea she reiterates in this
week’s issue).

0R PERHAPS IT was achieved when Jon Christianson

said he would consider taking “extreme action" to oppose
the F.

What nonsense!

It is terribly naive to speak'in this era of leading student
strikes or taking “extreme action" to oppose a change.

Students have changed, Grinnell students would no sooner
strike over the F than they would support bringing back the
draft. And a change in the grading system, after all, is hardly
comparable to the invasion of Cambodia.

BUT HOPP AND Christianson have not been the only
candidates to engage in foolishness. David Kramer has
also displayed a talent for spewing meaningless rhetoric.

Kramer's candidacy, at first, showed promise. After all,
his “messianic” platform constituted an appropriately
satirical response to the often unintelligible psycho-babble of
this election.

But Kramer has not displayed any willingness to appeal to
the intelligence of the students. He has yet to display any
interest in, or commitment to,student government.

In short, none of the candidates, including Hopp or
Kramer, have conducted the kind of campaign which merits

support. Consequently, students should boycott the polling
place Monday.

The answeru of course, is NO,
The problem is not “who is
president," but that ”there is a
president ”

Does Crinnell College really
need a president? Why" Ccrtainly
the students do not need one. The
past presidents have made
students compromise their desires

Any innovative policy that SGA
wants to pass has in be come
promised to some degree. or else

funds to pay for a trustees meeting

trustees pay their own expenses
even when coming to Grinnelll

Protection of minority rights in bathroom policy

To the editor: To argue that
college Students are adults (that is,
are over 18) and should be able to
choosetheir own bathroom policy
is idiotic. Adults, as we all know
from experience, are just as
capable of narrow-mindedness and

ldisregard of their fellow men as
.children. _
l The old bathroom policy of floor
ivotes with individual veto power
,‘was designed to protect the rights
'of the minority. This principle is
quite obviously essential to the
maintenance of the semblance of
liustice in a democracy.

However, I notice it is observed
1 0 ways at Grinnell. First.

L i
even ,one agrees that the rights of

.nia n

,mlnorities ought to be protected.
Second, most tacitly assume‘that

‘to‘ deny Mr.

the rights oi those who disagree
with them Should not.

For instance, when a couple of
women, black women at that,
wanted to exercise their ﬁrst
amendments rights by forming a
cheerleading squad, they were
nearly Jeered off campus.
Protesters came to their
organizational meeting, Articles
appeared in the stirs asserting that
Cheerleaders would spoil the
liberal, progressive image of

Grinnell (as exemplified in the Ob :

squad) and hence must not be
allowed. Certain women claimed
this re-inforced sexual stereotypes
and hence must not be allowed.
But by me same token, were we
the right of

wearing a three piece suit, or my
friend P ’5 right to wear
lipstick and hose'.l
And here we go again with those
too shy to shit and piss where they
fear they may be overheard,
i smelled out, or what have you, by
the opposite sex. These people are
modest, and I suppose, somewhat
silly,

But they do exist, drinking
sparingly, and going often to the
PRC.

They interfere with the rest of us
‘who don’t want to walk down some

stairs to relieve ourselves. Should
we tell them to Shove it? Why not?
They aren’t like the rest of us and
1 they spoil the college image. Clay
