 

I?!“ 14, I912 The Scarlet and Black

Pictures talk.
Some little boys don’t.

Some innerrcity ghettos have special schools. For little
ho'ys who don't talk.

Not mute little boys. But children so withdrawn, so afraid
of failure they cannot make the slightest attempt to do any-
thing at which they might fail.

Some don t talk Some den tlisten. Most donthehave And
all of them don t learn.

One day someone asked us to help,

Through Kodak, cameras and ﬁlm were distributed to
teachels The teacheis gave the cameras to the kids and told
them to take pictnies.

And then the miiacle Little boys who had never said any-
thing, looked at the pictiues and began to talk. They said
“This is my house," "This is my dog.” “This is where I like

to hide.” They began to explain, to describe, to communicate.
And once the channels of communication had been opened,
they began to learn.

We're helping the children of the inner-City. And we're
also helping the adults. We're involved in inner-city job pro-
grams. To train unskilled people in useful jobs.

What does Kodak stand to gain from this? Well, we're
showing how our products can help a teacher—end maybe
creating a whole new market. And we’re also Cultivating
young customers who Will someday buy theirﬁwn cameras
and ﬁlm. But more than that, we’re cultivating alert, edu-
cated citizens. Who will someday be responsible for our society.

After all, any business depends on our society. So we care

what happens to it.

{ More than a business.
