Faculty questions

‘ by Mary Brandt

Approximately sixty iaculty
f1 staii members met with
resident Turner and Dean Walker
in Grinnell House last Thursday,
the 16th, to express their growing
concern about the position or at»
iirmative action in Grinnell
College

With the intent of allowing
faculty and staff to put questions
directly to the administration and
to reach an agreement regarding
the kind of affirmative action plan
the College should have, the
meeting began with a note from

administration

Ruth Prescott, Associate Director
ot College Relations, “in the five or
so years since Grinnell
presumably established an air
iirmative action program l am iar
from being the only one to observe
it exists primarily on paper, is
expressed by tokenism, and most
recently in the elimination of three
administrative positions held by
women.”

In a sometimes heated exchange
Turner and Walker repeatedly
vowed an affirmative intent
towards hiring women and
minorities but were unwilling to

commit this intent to a written
plan, “We don‘t need a written
plan. This place is so small that
what we really need to do is
monitor those people, particularly
department heads, to make sure
that in every search we are making
the effort to get people.” Ron
Yang, in a persistent line of
questioning asked the President
what his priorities looked like,
specifically where attirmative
action entered the picture. “I place
my iirst value on the survival oi
the College as a financially viable
institution ”

In response to questions dealing
with the newly-created Vice
Provost job, Turner promised to
make “an aggressive active
search" tor minorities and women
through the additional help of a
screening agency, This agency
hopetully will “dig out people who
don’t want it known that they're
looking tor another job, tor
example," Mr, Yang then asked it
the President would be willing to
meet with a committee to discuss
the nature oithe job description for
the Vice—Provost position. “Well.
we would share the job description
but 1 think that it is an ad-
ministrative perogative . . I’d be
glad to show it to every e 'l

Roberta Atwell, chairing the
meeting, asked it the job
description and duties had been
written with the hopes or hiring a
woman tor the position. ”No."
Turner replied. “the criteria oi the
position are the criteria ot the
position. i don't think there’s
anything in the job description that
would be hostile to a woman
applicant.” '

Yang, speaking to the
issue why certain duties were
assigned to the Vicerrovost job,
argued that, “There are certain
linite tasks which have to be done
at the College. The decision as to
how these are broken up has a
consideration implied of what kind
or person you‘re looking for to till
this job , . There are ways oi
dividing the tasks which would
open up a position which a women
could fill.” To which Turner
replied- “Well i gotta be pertectly

candid. We are looking for a
business officer of the College.
Things being how they are, it‘s
gonna be hard to come out with a
woman Candidate."

The discussion moved next to the
manner in which the new Director
of College Social and Recreational
Programs was chosen. Yang
wondered ii there was any attempt
to train present incumbents or to
offer them the time in which they
could retrain themselves “No, no
oitering per se . . , in this newly
created position we have the
situation of someone with a degree,
seven years of experience in that
particular arca, and in whom
there’s coniidence on the part ot
the administration. It seemed to us
that to not promote from Within
would be reverse prejudice '. . . We
felt it was not necessary to have an
open search, That‘s judgmental , ..
Our judgment there was that when
you move from a job that exists to
another job with essentially the
same core, then it is legitimate to
promote from within ”

Yang, probing iurther, argued
that' “In the Case of women and
other disadvantaged people. with
our commitment to affirmative
action, it seems that the first thing
one would look at is: we have
someone here who's doing an
excellent jobiwhat's the
possibility oi retraining them?”
Walker responded, “In the case of
the Director of Campus Recreation
you have three people involved, In
the case of one of those three that
was oiiered and accepted the job,
we anticipate some retraining. It's
simply our judgment that he would
require the least retraining."

“If we take as our premise,"
Yang continued. “the notion that
having women in administrative
positions is valuable both to our
notions of ourselves as an in-
stitution and as rolermodels for our
students, was there any thought
given to an external Search so as to
find a qualified women candidate
who would not require any
retraining?” “In this case,"

 

replied Walker, “no.”

Moving on to the ads
ministration’s economic rationale
for making the cuts, Yang again
pressed the question or the
placement or values. “Everyone
says yes it’s one oi our values to
employ women on this campus
How important is it'?"

“It’s very important ”

“Well if it’s very important it
seems to have been out-balanced
by other considerations which
seem to be relatively pragmatic
and short-range."

“it’s unforunate that the three
people cut were women," Turner
argued. “but you have to look at
the long-range track record. . . you
cannot take this thing case»by-
case." Reaching the conclusion of
his argument Yang continue
“taking the unfortunate c
cumstance of three women being
fired we have certain obligations to
do What we can to redress this fact
in filling of the new (Vice-Provost)
position.” To which Turner
responded, “Well we can sure try."

Professor Voertman brought up
the question or humanitarianism
and Seniority._ ”We are dealing
with a person who has served the
College for sixteen years with
some quality. linothing else, there
is in our society. even in the most
cut-throat kinds of institutions, a
long—standing respect for
Seniority." “I can assure you,"
responded Turner, “there was
plenty of lower-intestinal grinding
around, believe me . . i but our
humanity can run us down the
tubes."

“I don’t think anything much
came out of it," Mr. Meyer sum-
marized faculty sentiment sucv
cintly, “Everyone was talking past
each other. An impression one can
get is that it was conflict for con-
flict’s sake. I’m not Clear how
afﬁrmative action fits into faculty
priorities either. [just don‘t think
we have the real reasons for the
way the reorganization was
handled."
