 

First game tomorrow

Gridders open with vet lineup

by Bob Meyer
As the northern winds begin to
make their Way for Grinnell, the
Pioneer football team begins to
make its Way ,for Rosenbloom
Field, Coach Edd Bowers believes
that this year’s squad is con-
siderably better than the one that
compiled a 4-5 record last year,
despite thelosses of Scott Fackrell,
Tom Goetz, Dennis Walters and
Mike Harris to graduation.
Bowel-5‘5 key strategy for this
year's team centers around the
positioning of Paul Matecki.
Matecki, who started at Offensive
tackle last year, will be playing
defensive nose guard tomorrow
aiternoon against iowa Wesleyan.
Starting at his sides will be veteran
Mark Blanchard and either
Harvey Pegues or Ken O‘Barski.
The defensive ends will be Bob
Grant and Steve Bolesta. This line,
averaging the weight of 210
pounds, is considered light [or the
standards shown in the Midwest
Conference. Their speed, however,
will more than compensate for
their lack of weight.

Co-captzin hurt

The defensive backfield will be
composed oi four veterans, as
senior Hosea Engram leads Rob
Eyre, Dave Chroust, and Brian
Shearer. The two linebackers will.

. be Charlie Gogel and either co»
captain John Hamby or Greg Lee,

_ Paul Delaney

Hamby at the moment is ham-
pared with an injury which may
prevent him from playing on
Saturday.

This year’s offense will be dif-
ferent with the losses of Goetz and
Matecki. Some people are skep-
tical about the transfer of Matecki
to defense from offense. Even so,
the offensive line looks strong With
Kurt Kohlman at center, Chris
Bowman and Steve McNamara at
guards, and Doug Cummings and
Ron Runser at tackles. The ends

will be cocaptain Paul Delaney.
the only Grinnellian ever to be
selected to the first allsloop honor
team, and either Dave Wopat or
Phil Cebuhar,

Crane QB again

The offensive backfield will be
captained for the third consecutive
year by Paul Crane. His running
backs will be Mike Hopkins, Dave
.Schafer and Mark Bowman. All
three of these running backs
pleased Bowers in last Saturday’s
scrimmage,

The gravy of the offense will be
in the passing attack. It is hoped
that the one-two combination of
Crane to Delaney will be as air
fective this year as it was in the
past. Crane, in the last two years,
has thrown for 23 touchdown
passes and 2,323 yards. Delaney
caught in touchdown passes and
gained a total of 727 yards in pass

Win streak
snapped

by Toni Arenberg

The women’s tennis team started
its season last Tuesday against
William Penn at Dskaloosa and
probably would like to iorget that it
did. The home team easily beat
Grinnell 7-2, and broke a three
year Pioneer streak oi consecutive
victories in dual meets.

Coach Anna Wack was disap-
pointed with the results. “They
tthe Pioneers) are just not quite as
good as the other girls. That’s why
they lost , . . maybe they had the
firstrmeet jitters.”

Wack said she thought Grinnell
could have won all the matches,
but William Penn had other ideas.
Second singles player Maggie
McFadden and fourth singles
player Amy F‘rieden won, while
Meredith Johnson was the most
successful of thelosers, forcing her
opponent into a tierbreaker. Team
captain Karen Meyer, Robin
Recant and Kit Wall lost, as did the
three doubles pairs.

Wack shuffled the lineup for last
Thursday's meet with Simpson,
Macf-‘adden moved into the top
spot, with Meyer moving down to
number two. Frieden played
fourth, while Nancy Fernandez
and freshman Marion Miethke
were placed in the bottom two
positions.

The line-up for tomorrow's meet
at Coe probably depends on
whether or not the new lineup was
more successful against Simpson
than the old was against William
penn, Said Wack of the opening
day deieat, “Maybe this was good
for us. Maybe We needed to find out
that we had to try a little harder."

Women crush Weak foe

by Tom Arenberiz

The women’s volleyball team
defeated Central College, in
straight games at Grinnell last
Saturday in the team‘s opening
contest, giving Tom Latimer his
first victory as a coach. The
Pioneers won 15-6 and 13-4, With the
Second match cut short by lack of
time.

Latimer said the performance of
the team pleased him, but ad-
mitted that some weaknesses had
to be corrected. He added,
“Central is not indicative of the
caliber of team we will be playing
as the season progresses. so we
have to progress with it,”

Brandon, Ann Chasson, Robin

scholarship to the University of
Pacific.

Latimer said he is thoroughly
enjoying his role as coach. He said,
“I'm probably preoccupied with it .
. . it’s a good diversion for me.”

The junior varsity team also
began its season with a win over
Central, although the match went
three games. After building a 9-0
lead, Grinnell lost 15 straight
points and the opening game. But
the Pioneers edged by in the
second, 15-13, and won the contest
with a 159 triumph in the third. At
one point in the iinal game,
Grinnell trailed 9-6.

Both the varsity and JV squads
play at Mount Mercy on Monday,

’ with the next home contest being a- -

receptions last year.

Coaches Mo Hunt, John Mar~
tinek, Arthur Peterson and Bowers
are pleased with the team’s ex-
perience. All of the above men-
tioned names are Grinnell
veterans. Not only is there more
experience, but there is more
depth. Bowers believes that as the
season progresses, depth will
become a crucial factor in the
team’s success. Bowers is
especially pleased with his iresh-
man backups. He likes their
potential and regrets the fact that
he cannot play them as often as he
wishes.

Tough schedule

Grinnell, a member oi the West
Division of the Midwest Con
ference, must play the strong
squads of Coe, Cornell, and
Monmouth. But it Will have three
games before they play those
members of the conference, and
the team might generate
momentum from a threegame

Paul Crane

winning streak.

The Pioneers begin their season
playing iowa Wesleyan tomorrow
at 1:30 pm. at Rosenbloom Field.
The coaches expect a win because
the visitors have won only two
games in the last two years.

Kickers scrape tie

Tieing Cornell lvl may not be
akin to kissing one’s sister but it
was irustrating ior the Grinnell
soccer team. Despite outplaying
the Rams for most of last
weekend’s game, Grinnell’s lone
tally came on a Wade Lee penalty
shot. Coach John Piitsch ex-
pressed satisfaction with the
team‘s periormance, adding
however, ”We were a little too
cautious going aiter the ball.”

the squad, the Siwash being the
following week’s opponent.

About Cornell, Pfitsch said,
“They Weren’t quite as good as I
expected them to be, but they were
as good as I wanted them to be.”
Forwards Pete St. Thomas and
DJ. McQuitty paced the attack,
despite iailing to convert several
opportune shots. Defensively,
Pfitsch had praise for John
Higgins. whose speed afoot helped
to break up several Comell at—

fullbacks Mark Schwartz and ‘h’m

After the first week of I.M.
football competition it looks as if it
is going to be a tight race for the
championship this year. With th ,
exception of Dibble's 46-0 romp
over Oowles and the decisive
Clevelanerames 30-3 victory over
a depleted Clark team, most of the
games thus far have been close
matches. In stunning upsets
Younkers [ell prey to both Norris,
