Lettuce causes FOG adjustments

by Bob .Vlitciicll

Tlievietory oithe lettuce h , eti

Service director Dave McConnell
to make adjustments in
the structure oi the meal plan in
Quad and Cowles dining lialis.

The reierendum. which iiniits
the Food Service to purchasing
only UFw eertitied head lettuce.
passed lty a do percent margin last
Friday. On-board students voted
371 to 200 in favor (ii the inltiathC,
wliiic oiihoard students voted tor
it El to 9.

When the present supply oi head
lettuce is eliminated, McConnell
will begin to monitor the salad bars
at Cowles and Quad to see ii cone
sumption oi nonriettuce salads

increases, If there is no increase;
he will take the money normally

spent on head lettuce and attempt‘

to provide alternative greens such
as Romain, Bibb and Leaf lettuce

According to McConnell. the loss
of head lettuce trom the salad har
will not create a serious ruiiagr
deficiency in the iood service diet
plan Alternative i-uiiage sources,
he said. can he tound iii apples.
Cole slaw, beans and whole grains.

Although Grinnell has boycotted
noii-UFW head lettuce tor the past
several years. the school was able
to secure UFW head lettuce irom
its iood supplier. in the past this
was economically teasible because
the wholesaler also distributed
UFW lettuce to the University at

lowa, which gave it the volume oi
orders necessary to uccomodatc
requests for UFW lettuce,
Currently, the Griiinell Foo

Service purchases ioodstiiiis train
the Continental anie grocery
wholesale suppliers in Des liloincs.
Grinnell is their only customer who
is ordering only UFii' lettuce.
According to Gene \‘an Viiet,
general manager at Continentai‘s
Des ltioines oiiice. Grinnell's order
oi its to 20 cases pet- week is not .
anywhere near the 200 case
minimum required by truckers to
justity a special shipment of UFW
head lettuce to Grinnell Thu.
head lettuce will only return to
Grinnell ii and when other in
stitutions supplied by Hoxie will
require UFw lettuce. ‘
