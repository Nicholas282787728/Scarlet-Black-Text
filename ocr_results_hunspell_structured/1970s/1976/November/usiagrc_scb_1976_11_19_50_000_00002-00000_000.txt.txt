World and he feels that the future
of the world will be determined
largely by the outcome oi the
struggle between the revolutionary
and counterrevolutionary forces
there.

In conclusion. Sweezy com-
mented that no country has suc-
ceeded in establishing a society
which is in any reasonable way an
example of idea] socialism, There
still exists a division between
managerial elite and manual
labor. The wage system is still in
use There is still inequality. Some
“socialist” societies. such as the
U.S.S.R,, have accepted the split
between the managers and the
common workers These societies
are moving in the opposite
direction from true socialism.

In explaining the changes and
additions to the proposal. CAS said.
“The recommendation of lhe

rationale for ‘CR-NC' was to ens

incompatible With the Crileria for
independent work in a field."

SGA PreSIdenl Ruth Mon-
tgomery commented on the
reasons ior the iacully approval of
the proposal. “Dean Walker‘s

figures remain high and capitalist
investment is failing to increase.
Sweezy doesn‘t know what will
happen to the capitalist economic
system, but he communicated a
pesmmisiic outlook. He feels that it
won't be long bciorc capitali‘

presentation. Some lelt
discouraged that there was a need

were inspired by Sweezy’s
description oi what socialism can
be. Others had difficulty recon-
ciling socialist ideology with
practical implementation oi
policy. Nonetheless Paul Sweezy’s
presence on campus seemed to
rekindle student interest in the
political issues that face us.
