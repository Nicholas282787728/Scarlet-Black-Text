place has spoiled me

On the bus home to Chicago at
spring break. I met a girl who had
been visiting as a perspective. She
was worried about coming to such
a small school in such a small
town Would she like it? There was
nothing lrnuld say that would give
her an nnswor, There are times
\\'llCI’l I wish I didn't know every
face in the Ftirum.and times when

I \\lSl1 the Cinema was one of,

several movie theaters. But even if
I rather blindly chose to come
here. i made a conscious decision

to stay. There was something in the
character oi this place that made
an extra movie theater un»
necessary.

Perhaps it has something to do
with routine or with tradition, but

whatever it is, this place has a'

charactcr independent or all of us
It produces humanities courses
and skip (lay. and insures that if
you can't find someone’s mailbox,
Ernie will find it for you.

Sometimes, amidst talk of dying
liberal arts colleges and Newsweek
articles about what education
won’t buy. we take ourselves too
Seriously, and in the name of
preservation we do an injustice to
the kind of education we are trying
to preserve An honors program
does not belong here, but with
students hecoming increasingly
competitive. it is probably
inevitable And sometimes good
teachers are labeled ”un~
tenurable," though no one has said
what “lenurable” means. Luckily,
this place will survive our
mistakes. It has a sense of humor
and a sense of right stronger than
nilr own Above all, it has a
tremendous store of kindness.

If I am sentimental, lhen, so be
it. I love this place. and Ilove the
people i have come to know here. I
don't know yet what Iwill miss or
what Will be forgotten. but I know I
am leaving stronger and luller
than when [arrived The character

A balance or “my identityrwith-

helped me to gain The “trip" was
hard but the true test of worth Will
always come later. So what were
my iii-st impressions? Questions
that formulated in my mind were
like how will I handle this place

eaten lasagna!) What can be ex-

As early as the tirst week or
school, lwas “shocked" in a Cruel
and natural way into thinking,
”you are going to need a lot at sell-

to discover how I would not do this
so caSlly‘) However, immediately
my perspective was being shaped
into something not clearly defined
by me at this stage or my lite.

Academically speaking, I never
Illill‘le an “F” until I came to
college and that can be a shocking
blow to any underclassmen that's
hallway serious about making it,
Only I discovered that sometimes
”tailing" is what it takes to re
Clarify in the midst of confusion.

My involvement with the cams
Inunily came through interaction
with Black students, especially
with those at my class. We
developed wa'rm relationships that
