Luck of the immigrants

by Debbie Weiner
Itis what many would consider a
typical Midwestern scene: a
rustic western apparel shop,
a displaying cowboy boots. jeans,
belts, and cowboy hats. The
customer is chatting idly about
horses, iarms, and the local 47H
club with the husband and wife who
lawn the store. But Wagon Wheels
West (on West 6th Avenue in
Grinnell) is a little different from
what one might expect. The
owners, instead oi speaking with
z’zthe usual lowan twang, speak
with What sounds like an Irish
brogue.
Actually, it’s not quite an Irish
brogue, owner Lyn Spriggs comes

from south Wales. and his wife,

Agnes, is a Northern lrelander oi
Scottish descent. They lived in
Grinnell ior ten years, coming
straight from Northern Ireland in
1966. From their experiences, they
view America and Americans.
',_ Northern Ireland, and life ‘in Iowa
.erom a unique perspective.

Lyn started out as a steeplechase

jockey apprentice. Although he

{became too heavy to be a jockey,

, he worked in the horse racing

‘business ior 25 years in England
before and after World War II. His
love for horses helped lend con-
tinuity to his life in transferring
from the United Kingdom to Iowa.
“Horses are the same all over," he
smiled.

During the war, Lyn worked in
Burma in charge oi mail transport
He met Agnes in Northern
Ireland, where he worked for a
time in the Ministry oi Agriculture.

‘.The Spriggses also operated a
general store in Ireland at one
time.

, They iirst came to visit Iowa in
ﬂood, and liked it enough to move
“ here. Some oi their relatives have

lived in the area for over fifty
years. Both their children live in
Iowa, also. Their son married an
~Irish girl and settled here, and
' their daughter is married to an
American.

In Iowa, Lyn has worked as a
iarmhand, tormer, and iactory
worker. He and Agnes
started Wagon Wheels West {our
years ago.

The couple {eels somewhat at

Ume in Grinnell, due to the rather

ﬁrge population at people of Irish
descent, Agnes noted that the
number oi Irish people living in the

area is “just unbelievable . , . I’ve
never been homesick since I came
to America. I was homesick in
England, but not in America!”
They iind that Americans are quite
knowledgeable about Ireland, and,
ior the most part, are open and
receptive to newcomers. Agnes
commented that “the people in
Iowa were so friendly and helpful
when we came." They quickly ielt
like part oi the community.

Enough relatives visit irom
Ireland that the Spriggses do not
feel isolated from the ‘Old Coun»
try,’ They do not intend to visit
Ireland in the near future.
“There’s too much to see here
yet,” Lyn remarked, They have
made five or six trips through the
West, from Texas to North Dakota,
and plan to travel more.

In many ways, they like Iowa
more than the United Kingdom.
“The biggest diiierence is the
weather," Lyn said He described
Ireland as very rainy, with a few
nice days interspersed throughout
the year. The sunniness and
dryness of Iowa are a pleasant
change. Also, the less-crowded
surroundings create a better at
mosphere. Like college students
irom urban areas, they, were
surprised that they could leave car
doors unlocked, and walk alone
late at night.

The Spriggses left Ireland beiore
the troubles between the
Catholics and Protestants began.
Agnes, who is a Protestant,
believes that the fighting and
tension is due to troublemakers—
radicals on both sides. She said
that there was “no trouble when we
were there . , ,goton real good with
all our neighbors,” They believe
the conﬂict is political, rather than
religious, The Catholics were
actually making progress beiore
the lighting, and were not that
persecuted, they said.

The couple had many Catholic
iriends, and expressed sorrow that
tensions now often prevent
friendships. “There's too much
hate now," Lyn said, Everyone
feels threatened to keep In line by

their own group as well as by the
enemy. Agnes tools that the
situation will continue. “I just
can't see any end to it. t . all sides
are just sufferln‘.”

Some aspects of Ireland com-
pare iavorably with the United
States. The countryside is
beautiful, Agnes said. ”. . , I
miss the sea, the mountains . .
They also cite Ireland's
educational system and health
plan as being better than
America's.

At age 11, Irish students take a
test which determines Whether
they will go to high school or

technical school. The high schools '

are more compact than ours,
covering two years of an American
college, according to Lyn. At the

end oi high school, students take a,

test that determines much of their
future, including whether or not
they will go on to a university.
Ireland’s National Health Plan
provides for free medical and

dental care for those under 21,.v
tor .

Hospitalization is free
everyone. Older people are taken
care oi at no expense to their
families, and, said Agnes, the
care given in nursing homes is
generally quite good. .

The health plan is not without its '

drawbacks, however. Taxes are
high, Lyn believes that “..,the
working man, when we leit, was
payin’ a third" oi his income to the
government. Agnes sees an
advantage in paying to the
government “instead oi paying to
these big insurances and making
them happy,” They also expressed
disapproval about the “large
number" oi people shirking work
to live on welfare, “It’s not the law
that's wrong, it’s the people that
abuses it," stated Agnes,

From Ireland to Iowa is quite a
long way to travel, both in distance
and in lifestyles. Seaside Ireland
and the ilat expanse of Iowa iarm-
land present quite a contrast.
But the Spriggses seem to take it
all in stride. As Lyn remarked,
“You get the same kind of people
all over the world."

The next time you sit down at
Hurling Library to hit the books
you may be interested to know that
below you lies the remains of a
prehistoric iorest. Buried about
fifteen feet underground is a tw0~
ioot layer oi well-preserved wood,
pollen, leai parts, irults and seeds,
which in some cases, is over 24,000
years old.

At one time there was a
Canadian Inrest full of Black
Spruces, but it was buried during
the most recent glacier retreat
about 20,000 years ago, explained
Ben Graham, biology proiessor,
The iorest was covered by a layer
at wind»blo\vn dirt and clay known
as loss. The layer oi soil has
preserved the remnants oi the
forest. While depOSItsof this kind

- are not unusual in glacier areas,

Graham noted that it is the only
one thathas been discovered in this
section of Iowa.

During excavation ior the Fine
Arts Building in 1960. the job
Ioreman noticed a dark layerloi,
soil between Is an‘djllz feet, below
ground level. The ioreman showed
the dark level to Graham who was
the iirst person to recognize it as a
peat deposit irom a prehistoric
iorest. Since that time, borings
have been made to discui/er the
extent oi this iorest. At minimum,
it covered the area bordered by

Roberts Theatre, Burling Library
and the First United Presbyterian
Church across Route Six. There
were no signs oi the layer beneath
the Science Budding. PEC, or the
Forum when they were being built.
Although Graham is interested in
discovering how large the deposit
is, this will not be possible until
there are more excavations in the
area.

The deposit was a slight nuisance
ior the construction crew building
the Fine Arts Building. They had to
submerge three {not diameter
concrete piers beneath the layer to
make iirm support ior the building.
Drama and art majors will be glad
to know that the building has had
no problems with settling since
that time. . , . .

The .wet layer-amused some
minor problems ior the newly
opened Burling Library in 1959,
according to Evan Walden, iormer
B&G director. Water from the
layer seeped through to the heat
ducts underneath the basem‘g‘nt
floors so that the,,heating system
carried water into the buiiding.
This problem was solved by
placing pumps in the heating ducts
to drain the water.

The deposit has not caused any
problems since the constructionoi
the' Fine Arts’Building and the
library, according to Walden and
Graham.
