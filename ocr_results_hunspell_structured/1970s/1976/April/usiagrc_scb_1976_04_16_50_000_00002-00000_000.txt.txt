Dan Meltzer and Carlson Smith,
concerts cn-Chairmen, want the
campus community to be aware oi
why Mingus is appearing in South
Lounge. They said that partly as a
result of inquiries they made last
semester concerning Mingus‘
availability, they received an oiier
over spring break irom his agent
ior a concert appearance on a
specified date, April 24

Because Mingus and his en-
Semblc would be “passing
through.“ the offer was sub
stantially lower than their regular
concert lee, Smith said. But much
to their dismay, the asking price
was still far above what the Con-

certs Committee could afford to

pay, given the lateness in the‘

academic year and other Com-
mitments the committee had made
previously. explained Smith. “This
consideration, along With the
unavailability of Roberts and
Darby, would seemingly have
precluded the possibility oi Mingus
periormmg in Grinnell at this
time,” Smith said,

But iortunateiy, Activities
Counselor Georgia Dentel was able
to negotiate a special “club lee"
ior an appearance in South
Lounge. He explained that the
contracted price is not much above
what other artisls have received
for South Lounge appearances and
is approximately half the total
projected cost of a Roberts event,
while probably less than three-
sevenths the total cost of an
“acoustically inferior" Darby
concert. This most attractive otter
Coupled with the aesthetically
superior South Lounge location
was too irresislable to pass up,
Smith said.
