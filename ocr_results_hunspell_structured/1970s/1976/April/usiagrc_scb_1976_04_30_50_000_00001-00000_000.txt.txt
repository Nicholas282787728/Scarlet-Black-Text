Curriculum Committee
approves “D”

by Dave Wick

Yesterday, the Curriculum

' Committee approved the proposal

for a revised grading system. After
voting to consider each component
of the proposal separately, the
committee made slight alterations
in the new plan and then accepted
it in its revised form. Among the

. changes were institution of credit-

I.

erase, elimination of numerical
equivalean, addition of “13+” and
“C+”, and, most importantly,
institution of the “D”.

Although the final decision of the
meeting, the reinstatement of the
“D" was most unanimously

’. rrived at by a vote of 94). Func-

tioning behind the vote was the
rationale that students not con-
cerned with gtades‘will find more
leeway For example if a student
is not making use oi the credits
erase and he does “D" work, then
hewillreceivea “D”. If, however,
he is on crediterase, and he does
“D” work, then he will receive an
erase or nocredit.

Crediterase procedures were
outlined and approved first. lt was
decided that a student may
register for a course and, within
first five weeks of the
semester, choose to place that

course on credit-eraser The basic.

premise of this option allows a
student to take courses in which he

‘or she feels there is little hope of

‘

doing well

Five weeks is also the alotted
time ior adding a “plus 2".
Therefore, the reasoning is that if a
student can decide within five
weeks that he likes a course well
enough to take on more work he
can just as well decide to make use
of the credit-erase.

Further stipulations include
restriction, of' creditrerase to l no

 

more than one course of six credits
pr less per semester. the option
can’t be applied to any independent
study, registration procedures
mustbe the same for a credit erase
as for a non-crediterase course, no
more than eight creditrerase
credits can be counted toward a
major, and, finally, credit will be
granted for satisfactory ”c" work
or better.

Committee Secretary, Mara
Porper, commented, “Credit-erase
is a viable option that should be
worked in. It has received strong
student support. The credit-fail
will enable students to take courses
out of their field.”

Classics Department Chairman,
William McKibben, said, “The
students feel it Will be helpful and I
think it’s something we should
work on."

A further aspect ol the proposal
concerned the addition of “8+”
and ”C+”, While several com—
mittee members considered the
present system adequately
defined, they were overruled by a
slim 5-4 margin. Furthermore, the
elimination of numerical
equivalents was agreed upon

For the proposal to be put into
action, it must now be approved by
the faculty. The Curriculum
Committee Will notify the Com»
mittee on Academic Standing of
the approval as well as recom-
mend the proposal to he faculty.

Although the final decision will
not be reached for quite a while,
Mr. Irving, Committee chair-
person, wants to get the faculty
thinking about the proposal as soon
as possible. He urged “The
proposal should be introduced to
the faculty now for pondering over
the summer.”

Pill) busted: Charges to be filed

by Mary Brandt

There are still some fine old
traditions rampant at Grinnell
College, among them bachelor
parties, Sunday night the Pub Club
was the scene of such a private
gathering, well-attended and
apparently much enjoyed. Un-
fortunately for the merry-makers,
Sargeant Shutts of the Grinnell
police force, on his way to work
Sunday night, observed some
“young town kids" hiding in the
bushes south of the Pub. Believing
the Pub to be closed, as is its usual
practice on Sundays, he thought
that the individuals in the bushes
might be attempting to vandalize
or break into the building, He sent
out three officers to the scene who
found the Pub open, serving beer,
and a party underway. The Pub
was ordered to close.

Monday evening at a meeting of
the Pub Club Board of Directors
the sequence of events was
reviewed. Dennis Walters had
rented the Pub facilities through
Rickie Stokes, intending to bring in
a stripper from Marshalltown with
a bringyour-own-battle policy. The
Pub, as a private club, believed it
could legally rent out its building
for private parties on this basis,
selling the beer in quantity to die
rentee before the event, This beer

would then be dispensed in the Pub
by regular Pub personnel (Mark
Nissen was bartending Sunday). At
the meeting Nissen emphasized
that these private parties are
always very closely regulated; in
this case a $3 admission charge, a
guest list and locked doors were in
effect

Rick Bierman, college attorney,
then explained the legal
ramifications. He said it is clearly
a criminal offense for any
establishment with a beer or liquor
control license to serve, sell,
dispense, or permit consumption of
beer or liquor on its premises
between the hours ol 2 am. Sunday
and 6am. Monday. in other words,
as Nissen succinctly remarked, “I
can’t have a beer when l mop the
floor Sunday afternoons”

Contrary to rumor, the presence
of the stripper was, in the words of
Chief Peters, “not a factor in the
criminal charges,” However, Jack
Worley, adviser to the Pub Board
of Directors, commented that “It
was a very foolish idea to have a
stripper around. If the Board had
known what kind of a party it was
going to be, and that there was a
stripper present, we would have
denied the request to rent."

Chief Peters and Don Schilds,
district attorney, both confirmed

 

Tuesday night that criminal
charges w'ould be filed against the
Pub Club as a corporation,
predicting that the maximum $100
fine would probably be levied, as
Well as suspension of the Fub’s
operating license for at least
fourteen days, It is also possible
that in the future, when the license
comes up for renewal, the state or
city could refuse to issue a new
one, according to Biermanl This is
unlikely, Bierman indicated. since
the Pubis not generally considered
a problem by the police.

Bierman recommended that the
Pub acknowledge its violation of
the law, that this violation was
unintentional due to ignorance of
the existing law, and “throw itself
on the mercy" of the court.

in light of the events Sunday
night the Board adopted two new
policy clarifications. Because
Gardner Lounge is not part oi the
Pub premises, no beer will he
allowed out of the Pub as in the
past. Cathy nankes. Board
chairperson, stressed the need for
student cooperation in this regard.
In addition, beer sales will be
changed: no beer will be sold
except during operating hours and ‘
then the only beer allowed off the
premises will be unopened six»

Women’s studies—
ln search of a place at Grinnell

by Elaine Ashbaugh

At the beginning of this
semester, a future for in
terdisciplinary women’s studies at
Grin appeared to be a definite
possibility. At that lime, a four»
credit course, entitled simply
“Women’s Studies,” was opened to
all interested students.

Coming under the Classification
oi a special topics course,
“Women‘s Studies” was never
designed to be a permanent ol-
iering. However, women planners
and implementers intended that

Eysenbach.

Marilyn Leonard, history and
American studies proiessor,
lectured on “Consciousness in
the Progressive Era: 1900-1920,"

this course would provide a core
from which to build interest in
future Women's studies courses.

Prior to “Women’s Studies,"
Assistant Professor of Economics
Pat Brenner had begun regularly
offering “Women in the Labor
Force.” This course, excepting
previous, short-lived special topics
and independent study
possibilities, was the only avenue
available to students who Wished to
venture into the area of women’s
studies. However, such forays had
usually been limited to study
within one academic department
and remained infrequent.

The present women’s studies
course was instigated by a study of
Grinnell women~faculty,
students, and alumni—carried out ‘
by cindy Jackson. ’75. Fairly late
in the last academic year, .lackson
presented her paper to a group at
Professor Brenner’s home. Two
students. Beth Preiss and Jean
McCarthy, talked with Jackson
following the presentation. Theyl
recognized the need for women’s
studies opportunities at Grinnell
and later discussed possibilities
with Brenner and Instructor of
Russian, Sheila McCarthy.
Students Preiss, McCarthy, and
Jackson next contacted Dean Mary

According to Instructor Mce
Carthy, original plans were for a
weekly or birweekly, on-going
colloquium where laculty mem-
bers would give papers. Not until
last semester were plans for a
formal course drawn up. Since no

funds could be obtained for the
course, students McCarthy and
Preiss, approaching all female
faculty members, asked them to
volunteer their time. The nine
women who volunteered took on
the course in addition to their
normal course load. Some
volunteered, although already
salaried only for partrtime
positions, None received “relief
time” from dieir regular classes,
”From my point ofview, the school
got a tree course,” stated Brenner.
