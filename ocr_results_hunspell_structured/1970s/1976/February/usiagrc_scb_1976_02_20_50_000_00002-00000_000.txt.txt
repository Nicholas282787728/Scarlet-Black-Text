Joint Boards is now operating
unconstitutionally because of the
failure to ratify the SGA budget
within 30 days after the start of the
semester.

After Wednesday night‘s SGA
meeting failed to get off the ground
because of the lack of a quorum,
Will Collins, SGA president,
warned that harsh measures would
have to be taken if hall
representatives insisted on
shirking their duties. Collins ex-
plained that Wednesday‘s meeting
was especially important because
of the need to ratify the budget, He
also cited housing policies that
need to be implemented, a con-
stitutional amendment, recom-
mendations for spending off-
campus funds. and changing the
dates on the acceptance of
nominations for next year‘s SGA
officers as being crucial issues that
needed to be discussed

Dealing with the growing abs
senteeism at SGA meetings has
become a major problem, The last

Lack of quorum stalls SGA

four meetings have ended early
and constitutional amendments
have been stalled at three of the
meetings due to the lack of a
quorum. Last Monday's meeting
began only after .lim Freeman
went to the library to get an
alternate representative in order
to make a quorum, Only 14
members (17 are needed to make a
quorum) showed at Wednesday’s
meeting. Especially negligent are
North Campus and offrcampus
reps.

Reasons for the absenteeism
vary. Collins suggested that people
expect the meeting to be long and
windy, so they don't attend,
Wednesday night‘s meeting was
untimely in that it coincided with
the Rosenfield lecturer. Walter
LaFeber.

Russ Damtoft, Loose Hall
representative, was to introduce a
constitutional amendment calling
for the removal of any member of
the Joint Board “who in each of
three successive meetings of the
Joint Board, is absent from at least

one roll call or quorum call and is"

not represented by his—her
designated alternate.“ The absent
representative, according to the
amendment, will be presumed to
have resigned from the Joint
Board and will be replaced by
another duly elected represen-
tative.

Collins, in connection with the
proposed amendment, threatened
to send out a “nasty letter" to all
Joint Board members to try to
instigate petitions calling for the
removal of absent representatives.
To bring the removal to a vote,
Collins said he would need 15 per
cent of a representative’s con»

stituency to sign the petition. When ,

brought to a vote. twothirds of
those voting are needed to remove
the absentees from their office. He
stressed that the hall represen-
tatives wanted their office and so
should accept the responsibilities
and duties that went with the ol-
fice, one of which is attending SGA
meetings.

Amendments find defeat

by Tom Fantea

It. took 45 minutes and countless
phone calls before the 7‘30 SGA
meeting on Monday could begin.
The delay was caused because not
enough voting members showed up
initially so that a quorum could be
formed.

The meeting took place so that
three possible constitutional
amendments could be considered
and voted on by the Joint Board so
that it any passed they could be put
on Thursday's referendum Two of
the amendments were proposed by
Rick DiBello and one was proposed
by Jim Freeman and Russ
Damtoft.

The first order of business was
DiBello’s amendment that
proposed that the SGA president
and vice president be elected on
the same ticket. The rationale for
this was that the elected in-
dividuals would be compatible with
each other which DiBello cons
sidered imperative if anything was
going to be accomplished in any
given year Alter arguments,

based mainly on the belief that the
vice president‘s position over the
Judicial system was important
enough to warrant the need that
the position be voted on separately,
a vote was taken and DiBello’s
amendment was defeated,
Freeman's and Damtoft’s
amendment was next considered,
It dealt with the process of
choosing the student coordinator,
which they felt should be done by a
committee of the Joint Board and
would be subject to the approval of
a majority of the Joint Board,
Their reasoning behind the
proposal would make the coor-
dinator accountable to the Joint
Board but also free him from
becoming a tool of the cabinet and

under the present ruling. The!

voting resulted in a tie which SGA
President Will Collins broke by
voting no, thus defeating the
amendment.

DiBello‘s final amendment therTé

came up for a vote. It also dealt
with the selection process of
student coordinator. but he felt the

coordinator should be elected by1

the student body and receive a
majority of the votes cast. This. he
felt, would restore a degree oi
autonomy to the student coor-
dinator and release him from any
political obligations to the
president who had bestowed the
job on him. Again the vote was tied
and again it was broken by SGA
President Will Collins with a no
