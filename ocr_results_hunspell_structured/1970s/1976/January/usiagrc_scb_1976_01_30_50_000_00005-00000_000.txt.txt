Put off by Student Affairs

To the Editor:
I moved out of my co-op house at
the end oi last semester. l planned
move into an apartment with a
friend because [needed some time
to get away from PEOPLE for
awhile, i do not consider myselt
~'isocial; i think everyone needs
ome time away from the constant
social pressures of dorm and
cafeteria life, It is very hard to find
true solitude on this campus, We
-m to be forced into this arr
titlcial microcommunity despite
our protests. So I decided to break
away and pursue my studies and
myself on my own. i went to
Student Affairs and was told that it
was impossible ior me to leave the
herd. “It is written in the handbook
. cconomic Considerations
prevent it.” i was determined. 1
Visited the mental health clinic to
get a doctor’s “excuse,” but,
‘ggcausc i was not diagnosed

schizophrenic, it did not
materialize When I returned to
Student Affairs my request had
turned into a plea, l was told to go
to another psychiatrist, perhaps
they could help me rid mysell of
this obsession to be alone. Also, I
was told to get a note from Mommy
and Daddy to say they too wanted
me to live off campus. Both oi
these absurdities were for the sole
purpose oi stalling me. And it
worked. The friend i was going to
live with had to confirm the
apartment and because i was
shaky on whether I was getting oti
campus, he had to find someone
else. So, Student Affairs, you won!
But have you really won? I read in
the current Student Handbook,
page 25, that student welfare is
your chief concern, it did not ap-

pear to be in my case,

Sexual role demeaned

by Katherine A. Kramer

In a political science course last
semester, Istudied an area that I
had never explored before. The
last three weeks of the course were
spent on pornography and the
power of the government to
restrict its distribution. The class
approached the subject matter
academically as a type oi speech
protected by the First Amendr

Tn the Editor:

The staff of The New Time not
only recognizes the truth ex-
pressed in Steven McKelvey’s
letter in the December 5 issue of
The Scarlet 5; Black {in which
McKelvey criticizes an article in
last semester's issue of The New
Time which suggests that anyone
ivith information on suspected
narcotic agents or police iniormers
should relay this information to the
staff of The New Time), but.
moreover, we express great regret
that this suggestion was ever
permitted to be printed in The New
Time. We (the majority oi last
semester's staff of The New Time)
agree with McKelvey that a list of
suspected narcotic agents is.
potentially, dangerously similar to
such enemy lists as employed by
McCarthy (and Nixon). Fur-
theriore, many of us question the
entire purpose of articles on drugs
in a socialistoriented newspaper.

ment, Besides a trip to the back
room oi the Varsity Newstand and
a iew racy passages in Supreme
Court decisions, my exposure to
obscene materials was limited.
Since my iinal paper in the course
dealt with obscenity (and because I
was basically curious), Idecided to
engagein a few more field trips ior
background material.

Varsity Newstand had supplied
me with all the “dirty”
photographs that I could stand, 1
read the story or 0 as an example
of pornographic literature. To
round out my trirmedia approach, I
saw the movie, Ellianuelle.

My immediate impression was
that the expression about
sex tin either pictures,
books, or movies) was basically

of men.

The first category is an im»
plication in most (5 S: M) Sexual
adventures. The basic theme
revolves around a woman who
finds true happiness in total subs
mission to males—complete with
all the slavermaster trappings of
whips, chains, and brands. Outside
the world of obscenity, the
stereotype ofthe passive but happy
female exists with less explicit
manifestations. Needless to say.
the idea of happiness through
slavery revolts me.

By implying that women need to
be taught their sexuality by males,
the pornography producers per»
petuate another vicious stereotype.

harmless. Even though I would not
choose to continue viewing obscene
materials, I feel that the govern»
ment has no right to act as the
omnipotent censor.

But I still felt somehow unr
comfortable with the pornography.
After questioning my reactions
toward the material, I began to
understand why I was displeased
with obscenity. Simply, obscene
material deals with sex and
therefore emphasizes sex roles and
the differences between males and
females. The portrayal oiboth men
and women is debasing, but since
the audience is predominately
male, the female image suffers
more. Three categories describing
women emerge from pornography.

1. Women must be slaves to men
to achieve iull sexual happiness.

2. Women must be taught to
understand their full sexuality.
(Men are naturally aware of their

piness. Beiore meeting “Mr.
Right," who shows her the ways of
the world, the 'woman is deficient.

The third category receives the
most attention since it is the most
obvious As a backlash to the
cotton fluffs of Playboy, women
may now enjoy musclerbound
bucks ot Playgirl. But this ape
proach still does not resolve my
major criticism; it only implies
that women can use men as sexual
instruments also.

My objections to obscenity
continue because most sexually-
oriented materials impose or
perpetuate stereotypes that are
detrimental to the image of
females. The depiction of sex is not
necessarily evil but the subtleties
that commend welldefined sex
roles hinder any progress toward
equal treatment or males and
females.

SAGA: eaters should be choosers

Brent Schondelmeyer

Among the most humorous and
informative pieces oi iniormation
to be iound anywhere on campus,
with the exception of the bathroom
walls, are the Sounding Boards in
either dining hall. They detail
students‘ responses to the concept
ofi“you are what you eat,” Some
seem to feel great displeasure with
themselves these days. A number

of students await With great ans .

ticipation the medical excuse or
the opportunity to move off-
campus and get off board, the
master stroke.

The objections here are not
specifically directed at SAGA per
se, but the college‘s approach to
the issue oiproviding students with
a food service. In his essay, A View
of the Future oi the College,
Richard Turner listed the iive
major expenses of the college.
Third on the list was the food
service at a grand total of $539,150,
which was one of the items that
Turner said were “beyond our (the
college’s) control." This surely
must have been an unintended

, comment, or I have misread it. for

if the college does not control the
food service-“Who does?"

in my four years at Grinnell, 1
have found the food service
adequate. But l have had nothing
with which I could compare either
the cost or the quality of the ser-
vice. There Seems to belittle effort
to seek possible alternative
arrangements to those currently
with SAGA, 0h, woe the demise of
the capitalist system. Whatever
are we going to do when we forget
the free market?

Prior to SAGA, the college
operated the food service hiring a
director. Now it has been involved
for some time with the corporate
structure of SAGA, It is one of the
largest institutional food services
in the country, which perhaps has
outgrown its economies oi scale
and, who like A & P, needs to
rediscover price and pride. Cons
sider the situation in which SAGA
makes more money the fewer the
number of board students at-
tending meals.

This is not intended to say that
SAGA should not make profits.
Perhaps they are low for this
SChODl when compared to other
places. All this attempts to suggest
is that perhaps other alternatives
are available, both private and
corporate, that might better serve
the physical needs of the students
and the iinancial needs of the
college If the college could get the
same service for less, would that
not be a wise choice”.

When the trustees were here in_

the fall, one intimated that the
college would be looking for a new
iood service this spring, If this is
indeed the case, I would think that
students should be informed
because we are indeed the ones for
whom the service is being
provided. SAGA is here neither for
the benefit of the facility nor the
administration, This is perhaps the
most disturbing point. Students
will not be asked what it is they
want in a food service, what it will
cost, and what the choices are.
These decisions will be made
paternally for us with our
“welfare” in mind.

It was disturbing that when the
decisions on faculty cuts were
made last fall the administration
did not avail itself of an “Open
Forum.” which now seems to be a
remnant of a previous time.
Students affected by such decisions
found out that their only peers who
knew anything were student
government oiiicials and campus
media who had private discussions
offrtherrecord for their benefit.
Questions like the size of the
iaculty, the argument is usually
advanced by the administration.
are institutional ones, which
students do not understand. We are
only temporary occupants at the
school and these deciSlons affect
the future of the college long after
we leave. This does not detract,
however, from either our interest
or need to be informed about these
and similar decisions that affect

'our current stay at the school.

This kind of argument, though on
the whole 1 consider inappropriate.
seems even less applicable about a
question like the food service.
Whereas we only pay a portion oi
what it costs to educate us, we pay
almost entirely the cost of feeding
us, It now seems that it will be
more difficult for students to get
off board as the number of students
who can live off-campus is limited,
Where faculty cuts affects many
constituencies of the college—the
faculty, the administration, and
the studentsithe question of a food
service falls almost totally within
the interests and perugatives of
the students.

Is it likely that we will be Con-
sulted or informed',l We do not have
to make the final decision, but will
we be presented with another fait
accompli'? Is it criminal to let
people on campus know that you
are seeking or considering other
possibilities?

I would think that such
knowledge would have a positive
impact on SAGA’s performance if
they knew that theirs was a year to
year existence. We seem to do it
with faculty members in the name
of economy, Perhaps SAGA should
be retained, but it is important for
us to know that we are getting the
best food service available at a
given cost. What do we lose in
looking elsewhere?

If you can not level with students
about what is going on, then
perhaps it is “getting too hot in the

. . .kitchen."
