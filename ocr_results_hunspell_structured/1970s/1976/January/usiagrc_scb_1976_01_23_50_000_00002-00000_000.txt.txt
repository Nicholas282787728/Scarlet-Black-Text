Briton discuss

A 1574 Time Magatine choice as
a world leader, a Conservative
member oi Parliament, and a
former member of the Shadow
Cabinet, Nicholas Scott will speak
here Thursday The Briton will talk
about “Social Change and Reform
in Contemporary Britain” in South

Sponsored by the GrinnelHn~
London Program, Scott will meet
with past and future London
students and staff and political
science students during the day.
An interview session with Scott and
students who recently returned
from London will be videotaped for
use in future Grinnell-in-London
orientation.

In i974, Time Magazine selected
150 men and women. under age as,
expected to create a social and

department and Walker said that
the College is interviewing can-
didates for that position at the
present time.

Dean Walker noted that although
Ms. Leitinger “probably would be
qualified to teach in other
departments, political science ior
example, her duties at Grinnell
will be solely with the sociology
department." .

in a related development, Dean
Walker announced that, “The
college stands firmly committed to
the maintenance and expansion of
the sociology department in.
dependent oi any other depart
ment.” There was some
speculation that the College had

r

political impact in the world. Scott
was one of six Britons chosen,

as soci

planned to condense the sociologyi
department and the anthropology
department into one, but this
seems not to be the case.

Saying that the process oi in:
terviewing and evaluating the
candidates for the two sociology
positions has been the most ex-
tensive in his memory, Dean
Walker concluded, “The college
has a hell of a committment to
making the department oi
sociology a permanent and viab1e
department, and that’s what a lot
of people around here don’t realize I»
We are going to establish a good
department oi sociology at
Grinnell or I’m going to die
trying.“

The Number shuts down

by Lucy Mattingly

“No support from college
students is,‘une of the primary
reasons for closing The Number,”
said Brian Mullan. The Number,
located at 807 Commerical Street,
was opened in April of 1975 to
provide college students a place to
get inexpensive drinks and en
tertainment; it will close on
February 27 when Mullan's lease
expires. Mullan was optimisitic
about its, success at iirst, but said
that now he rarely sees more than
30 students a Week.

Mullan stated mat part of ﬁle
problem is that many students
tried to compare places like The
Number in Grinnell to those in New
York or Chicago. “People seem to
iorget that they're in the far-
mlands of Iowa and not in New
York.” He cited several examples
including students coming into his

bar and asking for some exotic

>drink he had never heard of. “I

alsonncchada girl complain about
the cover charge, When I pointed
out to her that it would cost four to
five dollars more in a larger city
she said, ‘but this is Grinnell,‘
implying that no good act could
ever come to Grinnell." Mullan
admitted that there aren't many
good periormers who are willing to
come to Grinnell to play for one
night. it took Mullan over a month
to get Harvey Mandel, who will be
at The Number January 28-29. He
had to “catch him when he could,”
in between bookings in New York
and Chicago.

It would be easier to get good
acts if there were more business
Mullan said. “As it is now, I don’t
have the money to sustain any
losses that might occur ii i paid a
band to play and then had nobody

there. Just the initial costs of

chairs—took most oY‘n'ty money.“

Mullan tried many times to
attract college students. He
showed old movies and reduced theg
prices of drinks on several 00 -
casions, but said that students
would only stay as long as ”drinks
were cheaper and then took their
business to the Longhorn art
some other bar,”

At one time Mullan had cons
sidered buying The Number, but
said that though he made a lot of
friends. he had ”too many bum
experiences.” He plans to close
The Number permanently next
month and then do some traveling
to visit friends irom the Army. He
said he will probably return to
Grinnell eventually as his parents
live here as well as many good
friends. _
