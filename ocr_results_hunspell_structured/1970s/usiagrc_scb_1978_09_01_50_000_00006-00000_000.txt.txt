Drinking age changes,

and taculty.

WITH THE .\l)\'E.\'T 01' the new
law, Grinliell city police oiiicials
say they will check the Pub, as well
as other bars in town, more
ireouently than usual

Police chief Bill Peters says the
Pub is “just anodier beer joint, and
the police have a right to check
't ..Ii “9. see someone fairlyi
young. \ie‘ll check him out."

Till-‘1 t‘lllEF REQUESTS his
department to check at least two
liars every night, although he says
it usually isn't done that olten.

There is a maximum penalty of
$100 01' so days in Jail ior underage
drinking, but Peters says anyone
supplying liquor to people under 19
could be charged with the more
serious oiiense oi contributing to
the delinquency of a minor The
cifec|s til the law on campus will
extend beyond the Pub. The
current college alcohol policy
allows for unlimited free beer at a
number of tillrcampus events. plus
tut) free tickets for hard liquor

drinks. Additional hard liquor
tickets can also be purchased. That
policy will have to be reviewed
according to Dean of Student Air
fairs Jim Tederman. The Come
mittee on Student Lite is planning
to study the situation, but
Tederman, who chairs the com-
mittee. says he will contact the
college attorney lieiore he knows
what changes, it any, are going to
be made,

But the legal situation lacing
Tederman and the CSL is quite
clear Poweshiek County Attorney
Don Schild cites the new law no
onc can “sell, give or otheiwise
supply" liquor to anyone who is
underage it seems apparent that
the unattended kegs that graccd
parties oi the past will be missing
l'rom this year's events,

And this creates another
problem tor the CSL: since alcohol
for campus parties is purchased
with money from the activity fee
that evei-yonc pays, is it lair to
charge students iorsoniething they
cannot legally consume?

 

King of Hearts
to be played

by Niiiicy ('m'pclllcl'

This year's film program begins
nith a delighllully intelligent and
whimsmal satire and a Western
ized samurai tilm by a classical
American director,

One of the most requested films
on campus. King at lit s has had
a faithful and fanatita college
tollouing since its release in 1967.
French director Philippe (That
Mali From ltiol do Broca has
created a gentle parablc that
causes us to examine the violent
selirdestructiveness of the civilized
world at the same time that we are
laughing at the antics of Alan
Bates and Genevieve Buiuld

BATES PLAYS AN amiable Scot
in the last days of World War I who
is sent intoa little French village to
find and dismantle a giant booby
trap lett behind by the Germans.
By the time he arrives, the
yillageis have fled, leaving the
town in the Custody of lhe inmates
of the local asylum But these
inmalt‘s iiren'i [he catatomcs of

they are happy and charming
lunatics. ,ioytully pretending to be
tightrope w kers, generals,
dukes, duchesses. and Collrtcsans
Bates and the iiudleiicc tire soon
won over to their way oi lhouglit.

This is it gem oi a iilni, tiith ii
marvelous cast of actors playing
the crazies and exceptional
cinematography tmuch ot the film
was shot in the French town of
Senllsl, Although the sentiments
expressed may seem a little
simplistic. certain scenes elevate
and haunt the audience, such as the
film's final image of Bates Slan-
ding at the gates of the asylum,
seeking sanctuary, starkrnaked
and holding a birdcage. tFans of
Bates will remember that he also
bared his cinematic posterior in
Georgy Girl and The Fixer and
may perhaps attach some symr
bolic meaning to this.) In the words
of critic Judith Crist, King or
Hearts is “a subtle and penetrating
comedy encased in a most
beautiful movie "

BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK
(1959) Combines the elements of
the Japanese samurai film and the
American Western to explore our
treatment of Japanese Americans
during World War ii, The story is
set in the mythical southwestern

.town of Black -Rock.‘ where the‘ '
-inh;lbltani5 are bound L0gether.by .

the guilty secret ot their
mistreatment of a Japanese [21F

; Tcnsions explode uhen a
lmysterioiis stranger lhc‘s even
wearing lilachvt arrives in town
and starts asking questions. I lind
it difficult to imagine Spencer
Tracy as the stranger playing a
one-armed karate expert but that‘s
what they tell me, Tracy, directed
by John l'i‘lic niagiiiiiccnt SC\l'iIl
Sturges. won the prestigious
Cannes Best Actor Award lor his
portrayal oi this unique
protagonist. The cast includes Lee
Marvin, Robert Ryan. Ernest
Bni-gnine. Anne Fi‘anCls, and
Walter Brennan.

 

The problem is complex, and no
one seems anxious to solve it. But
with dorm parties coming up next
weekend, Tcderman and the CSL
will have to address the question
soon, What they decide is, at lhis
point. anyone's guess. The un~
certainty is best summed up by
Dean Waldo Walker who come
merited, “i don’t know how the
heck we'll Come out of it ”

0n campus, freshmen seem
slightly irritated but unconcerned
about the change Several un-
derage students have reported no
problems buying carryout beer in
twin However 18 year 0 1d Evan
Feldman said not being able to go
into bars will be an inconvenience
“It wouldn t be as bad if we could
just get into the Pub. Even it wc
couldn't drink. wc Could at least
talk to our friends.”

THE NEW LAW MAY be
presenting major problems to
some new students but in the words
ot one lresliman, “If you really
uant to get drunk. you can find the
beer to do it "
