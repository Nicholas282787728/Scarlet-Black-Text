Enrollment To Rise
Toward Goal Of 1500

Dean Walker, Deon oi Admissions
D. Nicholas Ryan, and more than
sixty laculty members discussed
Monday the college’s recently dis-
closed plan to gradually increase
enrollment to 1500 Without concure
rently increasing taculty size.

The principle of increasing the size
of the student body by fifty students
per year has been approved by the
Executive Council and a group oi
Trustees as the best way to meet
the college's financial situation. At
the request or some faculty, Dean
walker took this before the regular
iaculty meeting.

One significant result of the stu-
dent body increase, Walker said,
will be an increase in the student/
faculty ratio; there will be a neceSs
sity to move to more etticient teach»
ing methods so that more students
can be handled in classes.

Because Grinnell’s applicant pool
is limited and prerselective, there
might be a decrease in the quality
of students with an increase in the
student body. Dean Ryan reported
that applications are up in number
this year by about 100, and lower
standards will not be required for
the 1972-73 freshman class.

Unless the applicant pool continues
to increase, however. somewhat
lower standards may be necessary.
This year, Grinnell will reject only
200 of its projected lSUO applicants.

Kenneth Christiansen, Eilogy, ar-
gued strongly against any increase
in enrollment, saying that he feared
return to “the bad old days" when
some students couldn’t take the
regular academic load. Christian»
sen also said an increase in enroll~
ment without an increase in faculty
would make free choice under the
no requirements curriculum “farci-
cal."

Eugene Herman, Mathematics, ctr
fered a pessimistic view of the pro
posed increase, based on studies of
recent applicants made by the Ada
missions Committee. These studies
Show, he said, that the percentage oi
those denied admission has steadily
declined, and the indicators which
project college performance have
gone down. ,

Projected demographic changes
may make it necessary ee or unwise
_, for the college to proceed toward
an enrollment of 1500, according to
two taculty interpretations.

Robert Voertmen, Economics,
mentioned the numerous additions
to the physical plant of the past ten
years as an important fixed cost to
the college. Theplantcanbe utilized
much more efficiently, Voertman
said, and standard economics of
scale considerations would suggest
the increased enrollment.

Largely because of this uncertain-
ty with demographic trends, and con-

siderations such as federal ziid,
changes in the attrition rate, the fi-
nancial need of marginal applicants,
and the availability of more student
housing in Grinnell, the enrollment
increase is being taken as a year by
year decision. The 1500 ﬁgure, Wale
ker said, is a maximum.

At the meeting, the faculty voted
their approval tor the new policy and
standards for the admission of stu-
dents. The only changes from last
year were an addition of a Black
Admissions Board (agreed on in
December) and the use of ACT
scores.

Aptitude test scores will continue
to be used as part of the selection
process.

At the Monday meeting, the taculty
also held the initial balloting for a
new faculty chairman (the runoff, be-
tween Phillip Kintner, History, and
John Keninschmidt, French. will be
conducted through mailboxes this
week).

A calendar for the 1972773 aca—
demic year was approved; it pro~
vides for a somewhat lengthened
tirst semester and thus an approxir
mate equalization in the number of
class sessions in each semester.
New student Days will begin August
26 and registration for first semes-
ter classes August 30, 1972.

Fall mid—semester break, short-
ened to four days, will be October
28—31, inclusive; parents andalumni
activities will be scheduled for the
previous weekend. Second semester
will be substantially the same as
this year.

Continued student involvement in
the case of Alan Nasser has taken
the form of meetings to educate
members of the student body who
have not taken tin active interest,

The broader issues of student
power were also discussed last week
in meetings between students and
faculty members. These meetings
are the result of actionby three task
forces created by Students at the
March 2 student power meeting in
Main Lounge.

Jenna Finch acted as the chairman
of a committee to increase student
awareness of the specifics of the
Nasser recontracting. Friday night
meetings were organized on the hall
or floor level to discuss the case.
Although the meetings were sparsely
attended, the organizers do not feel
that they were a failure. of between
twenty and thirty meetings, onlytwo
reported a majority oi students un-
favorable to Mr. Nasser’s position.
The education task lorce has agreed

Is Smith Annex Burning?

A shortrlived fire on the lower
roof of Smith Annex brought the
Grinnell Volunteer Fire Department
to campus at about 10:40 Sunday
evening. However, the fire, which
was in a box of waste paper, had
been extinguished by the tilne tire-
fighters arrived.

Jim White, a resident of 1327 Park
Street, was watching television when
he noticed what he described as “It
spark tollowcd by a three loot burst
of flame”, He called the Fire Def
partnient and then went Outside to
investigate.

He found that the fire Wits in a box
of paper which had been pushed on-
to the root of Smith Annex. Several
people were observed on the root

near the box, and White reports
hearing a “sizzling noise". When
firemen arrived, the fire had already
been put out,

Sgt. Lamb of the Grinnell Police
Department told the 5&8 that ap-
parently a student was burningtrash
in the box in his room and when the
fire got out of control he kicked the
burning box out of his window onto
the roof. ”It wasn't intentional -
just somebody not using very good
sense”, He speculated that the fire
also could have been caused by
carelessness will! a cigarette.

No damage was reported, and fire
and police officers left the scene
about 10:55. .

For almost two years now this redetailed
hawk has greeted Visitors in the Science
Building. He Wzis captured after being found
with a broken and permanently injured wing.

Task Forces Talk To Faculty

to continue their efforts to make
students aware oi campus problems
and the issue of student power.

One of the major problemsthatbee
came apparent to students during the
February 29 and March 2 meetings
was that the Executive Cuncil is
structured so that its decisions rag
main unaccountable to students, A
task force formed to deal with this
problems met Sunday with faculty
members David Abel, Music, Greg-
roy Guroii, History, John Morr ,
Psychology, and Beth Noble, Spane
isll, and discussed the Executive
Council with the task force.

It was noted by many during the
meeting that the chances oi getting
students on theI Executive Council
were sliln, and the chances at the
Executive Council to reveal its de-
bates nil The chairman, KaySophdr,
noted that the job of the task force
had to be long range since it in—
voived changing the attitudes of many
members or the college community
Miss Noble and Mr, Abel pointed
out that the problem of accounta-
bility of the Executive Council was
not limited to the studeilts, but that
faculty members had a hard time
finding out how decisions were made.
Miss Noble noted that the College
lacked a sense of direction, and
hoped that a restructuring of de-
cision making would help.

Turning to tactics oi eilecting chan-
ges in taculty and administration
opinion, Mi‘ Glii'oll stated that the
takeover of the Library was a counr
tei‘rpi‘oductive method He explained
that it was Executive Council policy
that students be givenashorttimeto
clear out ot the Library hciore they
would be suspended or expelled

A third task force on student input
through depaitlnentul EPC’S also
obtained inculty opinion his meeting
Sunday with Alan Jones, History and
American Studies. The group has

drawn up a tentative proposal to for-
malize the EPC structure along lines
somewhat different than those sug—
gested in the Student Co-ordlnator’s
proposal. The task force would like
to see Lin equal weighting of student
and taculty opinion in recontracting
cases. In order to do this, task force
leader Rob Ranier said, EPC recomr
mendations would include the major-
ity decision of the EPC without dis-
tinguishing between student and
taculty votes.

All three task forces plan to make
recommendations immediatelyafter
break.

For McGregor

Russ Mccregor chalked up an
impressive 61% of the vote in a
landslide victory for the SGA
Presidency. McGregor, a junior
biology major, received 373 votes
while nearest rival, Chris rreeberg,
received only 91 {or a 13% total.

McGregor campaigned on a plat—
form Which advocated the realization
of students' powers. He pointed out
that the administration actually utir
lizes little of its power, and thatthe
faculty and students are the two most
powerful groups on the campus. He
added that the faculty has difficulty
acting because of their “marathon
debates”, and thus students can exA
ercise the real power at Grinnell if
they “resolve the question 01 tac—
tics”.

Russ advocated the utilization and
expansion pt existing channels, anda
structuring ot SGA to represent the
diverse needs of such groups as AJS,
CBS, and the Women’s movement.

At a Sunday evening candidates’dee
bate held in Younker Lounge, Mc»
Gregor fold the fifty assembled stur
dents that he saw the job of SGA
President as “Guiding the SGA v find
out What the students want, find out
how to do it, and get the job done.”
In answer to a student's question,
McGregor added that he saw force
only as a last resort — and he strong-
ly differentiated between force and
violence.

He noted that, if students who felt
a protessor was not allowing suie
ficient discussion in class simply
refused to speak in that class, that
this tactic would be a type of force.
Russ added that there is sometimes
a grey area where channels end and
force begins - and that this was the
type of “imaginative force" which
might at times be necessary.

in an election night interview with
the 35:3, McGregor stated that his
first concern will be getting the
right people tor the SGA Cabinet,
and encouraging student participaA
tlon in the upcoming Vice Presi-
dential and House Presidency elec—
tions. "This is not a one man show
— its a lot or people working collec—
tively to get things done".

Out of the more than 1200 enrolled
Grinnell students, only 615 . less
than half 7 voted in the election,
despite special arrangements for
members of the Choir (who were
on tour most of Tuesday) and off‘
campus residents.

Oppose Quota Removal

strong opposition to the abolition of
the quota system has developed, and
a group led by Alan Goldberg and
Gregg Golden are expected to take
the matter to the Joint Board tonight
for a rehearing.

In last week’s meeting, the Board
accepted recommendations by both
the Housing and Social Policy and
Regulations Committees that the
quota system for room draw be
abolished.

Since then, Golden and Goldberg
have been collecting letters in oppo-
sition to the Change, At press time,
they had collected 170 letters, and
expected to reach the 200 mark by
the Joint Board Meeting.

TOTAL sis

Listed as the main reasons for
opposing the change were tears that,
without quotas, an uneven distribue
tion might occur among the classes,
and that freshmen might find them»
selves in virtually “aliasenior”
halls or floors. Proponents of the
new plan feel that, becauseireshman
rooms are evenly blocked on various
parts of the campus, little difficulty
would result from the change

Pass EPC Plan

The Parslow Grading Proposal has
been passed by the Educational Pol-
icy Committee and, with some reviv
sion, was approved by the Executive
Council and forwarded to the faculty
for consideration.

Faculty Chairman Beryl Clotielter
is preparing a complete explanation
of the proposal for the faculty.
Faculty consideration oithe propos-
al is currently slated to begin im-
mediately after Mid-Semester re—
cess.
