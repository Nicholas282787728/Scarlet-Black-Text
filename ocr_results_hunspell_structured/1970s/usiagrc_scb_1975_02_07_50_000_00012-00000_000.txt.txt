Outstanding Pioneer

Mitchell, predictably, was en
thusiastic about his team’s
showing against Knox. He credited
“great team effort, the ability to
play together as a fiverman unit
and not as individuals“ as the key
factor. “If we control the tempo we
can hang in there with anybody,“
he added, evidently referring to the
upcoming tilt at Coe.

Mitchell was particularly
pleased with the strong defensive
play manufactured by Williams.
Williams “will probably be the
‘Outstanding Pioneer’ on the
locker room Achievement Chart,”
he commented immediately after
the game.

Most significant was the ac-
curacy of the Grinnell team. The
Knox game marked the fourth
consecutive contest in which the
Pioneers shot over 50 percent from
the field.

And the bad news

Not as rosy were the C06 and
Carleton matchrups. Friday’s
home game saw Coe outjump,
outmaneuver, and, not sur»
prisingly, outscore the shorter and
younger Pioneers 86-66. Coe moved
out to a big lead at the outset and
never relinquished it. Bright 51:03
for the Pioneers were the 23 points
from Haigh’s hot hand, a strong
game from senior play-making
guard Bruce Johnson, and good
boardwork from freshman Thurs.

Something happened to the
previously tired up Pioneers when
they left the friendly confines of
Darby Gym and journeyed north to
challenge Carleton. Needing a win
to hold ﬂ'leir hard—earned berth in
the first division, the Pioneers
couldn’t seem to get going. Neither
could the hometown Cal-ls,
however, until late in the first half.
The small, nearly silent Carelton

both teams. Carleton finally
prevailed, 80-65
