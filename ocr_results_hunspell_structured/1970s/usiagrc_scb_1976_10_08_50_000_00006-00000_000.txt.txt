 

Faculty passes “D” grade

The new grading proposal was
the main topic oi discussion at the
taculty meeting on Monday, 0c-
tnber 4 Unlike the previous
meeting. where seating was at a
premium, iewer than halt the seats
in the science lecture auditorium
were tilled. and a quarter at those
present were students. Faculty
discussion on grading was
desultory. and many yawns were
seen among both taculty and ad.
ministration The entire meeting
gave the appearance at being a
iormality necessary to the
bureaucratic structure of the
College.

Mr, Irving brought the
Curriculum Committee grading
proposals to the meeting, and Dean
Eysenbach the objections and
amendments from the Committee
on Academic Standing tCASl

numerical equivalents will con

The grading proposal was split into
three separate recommendations,
the first of which was divided into
seven sections The Culliculum
Committee and the CAS disagreed
on three points in recommendation
it. and these points were brought
heiorc thc tacultv as amendments
to the recommendation

lntlic Iirst oi the disputed points,
the Curriculum Committee had
recommended that [our credits of
"D" work Count towards the
major. and the CAS amended the
recommendation to read “No “17'
work may Count towards the
major." Mr. Adelherg spoke
briefly in iavor oi the amendment,
ltlr lrving even more brielly in
favor oi the original. and the
amendment passed casi g.

proposal was in line with current
policy regarding practicum and
excess departmental credits. and
there was no reason to change that
Mr. Gurotf asked if the ”D" grade
would then become a punishment
for students who neglect to drop
courses. Scattered criticism of the
erase system was heard, and the
discussion was brought back to the
point when Mr, Adeiberg pointed
out that once credit is recorded on
the transcript, students have no
option as to what does and does not
appear. Mr. Steele added that as
students can in tact erase courses
up until the iinal exam, it is always
a student option whether or not to
- cept a “o.” and therefore
whether or not a given “D" would
appear on the transcript. The
amendment was passed.

The third point on which the two
committees disagreed was the
practice of recording both grades
when at student retakes a course
The Curriculum Committee asked
that the lower grade be erased,
while the CAS wanted to continue
with the present policy of showing
both grades in the case of a re-
take. No discussion was torn
thcomilig. and the amendment was
passed.

Point six of ltccomllicndation A
was then discussed' “that 2t C or
better is necessary to satisfy a
prerequisite tor a higher level
course,” A question has raised as
to whether this rule \\ tiuld lntertere
with the right at the instructor to
give pcruiission lor a student to
take zl course. In icw ot the
negative answer received. l\lr.
Kleinschmidt asked it there was
any purpose to section six of the
recommendation The math
department in into jumped to the
dcfcnsc.sayilig that it was “almost
criminal”toallowastudenttotake
1| course she-he is not prcpai‘cd tor,
I\Il‘. Gurotl' said, ”The ‘D' grade
seems to bc a step taken to ac-
comodate the math department,"
adding that it would probably have
the eiiectoiturnmg “C's” to “D's”
rather titan NC's to a credit grade

Recommendation A was passed by
a large majority

Recommendation B involves the
addition of plusses to 8'5 and Cs.
and the elimination of GPA's. Mr.
Irving said that in the time since
the Curriculum Committee had
recommended this change, he had
become convinced that it was
unnecessary Mr Herman, Mr
Clott‘elter, and Mr. Voertman also
voiced this opinion. as did the rest
at the [acuity by Voting the
recommendation down
unanimously,

Recommendation C, the third
and last possible alteration in the
grading system brought to the
iaculty on Monday, was the
possibility of a Credit-No Credit
option for students. Dean Walker
voiced his support at the
Curriculum Committee’s proposal
that such an option be allowed Mr,
Clotielter, Mr, Voertman, ,
irving, Mr Goldsmith, Mr,
Kleinschmidt, and Mr Herman
spoke in tavor or the option
Restrictions wcrc secn as ab-
solutcly necessary. mostly on
deudlincs for declaring the CR-NC
option. Mr. Goldsmith mentioned
that it is almost impossible to give
lair letter grades to beginning
music students, and supported the
option for that reason, Mr, Fish»
man said he didn’t like it but
\louldli’l oppose a CR-h'c option it
“the Dean in all his wisdom,
having served on may come
millees" agreed to the proposal
After more argument about
deadlines and grade manipulation,
Dean Walker asked that the entire
Recommendation C be turned back
to the CAS for clarification of the
points being argued and an im-

The faculty poll on the while
Paper was the next topic oi
discussion. Most faculty. Mr
Erickson reported, do not feel it is
the taculty’s business who attends
Grinnell, but some wanted to see
more iowans and deﬁnitely more
heterogeneity. it is felt however
that it is not the faculty’s business
to see to students’ personal growth.
“We are educators, not social
workers,” The reaction to the
concept of shared experience was
simply “Blah." Practical
education was seen to be worthy of
further faculty consideration,
although a few voiced the opinion
that “All good education is
inherently practical ” The Global
Society is not something the
laculty feels it can deal with, and it
is not interested in lorcing cone
sideration of its problems The
question at distinctiveness was
seen as being important, With
Grinnell’s distinctiveness a Iunc-
lion oi its size and excellence A
conservative point of view was
recommended by the majority
The joytul community interested
only one third of those responding
to the questionnaire, with Mr.
Kurtz expressing the main sen-
timenl' “In Colleges. as in lite,
happiness is only round it it is not
sought as an end in itself.”

The first time the student “as
informed by President Tui‘ncl' that

at iaculty meetings Mr, Giirolt
responded that the rule read
“Observers may be recognized to

include allowing students to voice
