Proxies merit
student attention

Should Caterpillar Tractor Company's activities in the
Union of South Africa be monitored? Should Texaco Inc.
move to end all business dealings with communist countries?

If the number of letters Corporate Responsibility Officer
David Crosby received are any indication, the campus's
answer to these questions is ”who cares?”

T0 SOME EXTENT, the lack of response to the two
resolutions can be attributed to unfortunate circumstances.
The Caterpillar proxy arrived on campus shortly before
spring break, when students were gearing up for mid-
semester exams or preparing to leave. And according to the
guidelines the college uses to act on shareholder resolutions,
the vote of Crosby was due during break. These cir-
cumstances prevented much campus debate on the
resolution.

Sadly, the proxy now on campus, which concerns Texaco's
business operations in communist countries, doesn't have
the sex appeal associated with resolutions dealing with
corporate activity in South Africa and doesn‘t appear likely
to attract much attention either.

BUT, DESPITE THE unfortunate timing surrounding
the shareholder resolutions, the wave of apathy which has
greeted this year’s proxy season and the issues posed was
sadly predictable.

Students today, it seems, are making a conscious effort to
abandon the radical role many have expected them to play
since the “glory years” of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s
This effort, to some extent, is healthy, if it results in an
abandonment of the mindless sloganeering and the liberal
group-think mindset of the period,

BUT WHAT'S REALLY happened is that students have
abandoned interest in the world around them and how it
affects the community in .whichthey live. These are the kinds
of questions raised by shareholder'resolutions.

The Caterpillar resolution, for example, posed several
interesting problems The church groups which proposed the
resolution admitted Caterpillar’s record for combatting
apartheid is relatively good. A spokesman for the group
further conceded the company most likely isn't selling
equipment directly to the South African military or police
since that would constitutea violation of U.S. law.

IF CATERPILLAR'S RECORD is relatively good, and if
they cannot legally sell equipment to South African security
forces, is a committee really needed to review the company’s
activities? 0r, given the repugnant nature of apartheid,
should such a committee be set up as a display of concern
about the inexcusable oppression over which the South
African government presides?

The Texaco proxy also presents several interesting
questions. The most important of these concerns the broad
problem of corporate morality. If corporations are going to
display concern about conditions in South Africa, shouldn‘t
they also be expected to work for the improvement of human
rights in communist nations as well‘? And if this is a
legitimate goal, is the best strategy for pursuing it to move
out of communist countries?

ALAS. NONE 0F these questions are likely to be ad
dressed on campus this year. Students today have replaced
the sign-waving, slogan-shouting mindlessness of an earlier
era with the disco~induced torpor of the me-generation.

In their rejection of earlier excesses, they also ignore
highly important social and political issues which affect
them and the world around themr

The current proxy season offers an ideal opportunity for
students to rekindle this concern and abandon the me
generation ethic so prevalent today.

Letters to the editor

Iowa Socialists join in campus MOBE debate

To the editor:Being a carpet
bagger from out of town, I don‘t
know how long the controversy
about the arms bazaar has raged in
your paper. but I did read David
Blalt‘s April 6 letter and can’t
resist responding. I object par-
ticularly to two of his contentions:
1) that the Mobilization for
Survival is a liberal group: and
2! that the protest against the

Nuclear protest
at Arnold site set

To the editor: The Duane Arnold
Nuclear Energy Center near Palo
has been the subject of controversy
for the past nine months. The plant
was closed from June 1978 until
March of this year due to damage
within the system. It was closed
again for a Short time at the
beginning at this month for further
repairs.

Concern about the nature of this
plant and its effect on Iowa
residents (including noose of us
who may be here only during the
academic year) has been ex-
pressed by many groups including
Grinnell MOBE This concern has
led to the organization of a legal
rally to take place Saturday, April
21.

Particularly in light of recent
incidents at omer power plants
including Three Mile Island Plant
in Pennsylvania, we feel it is of
vital importance to express our
Concern at this time. An accident of
this Sort at the Duane Arnold Plant
could be disastrous to the areas
surrounding Cedar Rapids,
spreading even to Grinnell.

arms bazaar was almed at foreign
governments.

l) The Mobilicalion for
Survival is an ad hoc collection of
groups, some of them liberal, But
the premise and thrust of the
Mobilization is radical: that
disarmament Will come not
through governmental
maneuverings but in response to
the concerted mass action of the
people of all countries.

2) We were at Rose-
mom to protest arms sales—and,
therefore, trying to stop them—
pretty much successfully, judging
by the poor turnout among the
displayersithe U.S. merchants
and manufacturers, who seem to
be our responsibility laccording to
Blatt's thesis of taking care of

domestic problems ﬁrst). As for
the “foreign governments"
present, such as South Korea. the
US. government has a pretty big
say in keeping them in power7
they are not as “foreign” as they
ought to be.

Let me suggest to Mr, Blatt that
he take another look at me
“domestic and presumably ace
countable decisionrmaking
processes" he advocates in‘»
ﬂuencing, Where is the decision-
maklng process to inﬂuence
corporations not to make or sell
weapons? ‘A's long as profit rather
than usefulness determines what is
produced, our powers of per
suasion are likely to be unheeded
by arms manufacturers, Bill
