where Kramer lacked expertise and
has worked well as one of Kramer’s
top advisors. Turnbull has also shuwn
that he does have a sense of humor:
on a recent notice he called himself
the “vice messiah.”

Hopp’s efficient handling of her ofr
tice has also made the administration
run smoothly. She admits that she and
Kramer have had “disagreements
about the way David handles the job.
But that’s not to say he’s ruining Grin-

working well and that she is satisfied
with the way disputes on the cabinet
are handled. She says that overall,
Kramer has done “a good job."

Jeff Cronin has opened up new
financial possibilities for SGA through
his investment procedures, and he‘s
having no problem working with the
other cabinet members.

was Boughey. Indeed, Turnbull's efr
fectiveness caused one cabinet insider
to remark that “David and George are
more like co-presidents than a presir
dent and vice president.”

No one denies that Kramer and
Turnbull closely discuss matters of
importance to the Joint Board; at the
same time, it is clear that Kramer
does have the ﬁnal say in cabinet
policy. He prefers to work toward cone
census decisions with the Cabinet, so
there have been no Showdowns be-
tween Kramer and omer cabinet
members.

But, in addition to his policyrmaking
tunctions, the vice president position
also has certain specified areas of con-
cern, Among these are curricular mat-
ters and Judicial Council.

Turnbull has tried to make Judicial
Council less legalistic than it was last
year. To this end, he has worked With
the Office of Student Affairs to
develop new guidelines for the conduct
at hearings.

Now, when a complaint is brought
before the council, the council .
members themselves will do the bulk
of the questioning. In the past, the ads
vocates for the plaintiff and defendant
did most of the questioning. Finally.

Constitution revision is another area
that concerns Turnbull. He is current

cabinet openings, have both proved
competent in their positions.

Several other reasons have also con—
tributed to the success of this year's
cabinet, Hall presidents seem more
willing to concentrate on substantive
matters than they did in the past. Last
year, Kramer feels, time was often
wasted discussing petty points.

College President George Drake has
made matters easier, too. From all
accounts, Drake is willing to listen to,
and respect, students' opinions.

Another reason is, as George Turn-
bull put it, “We haven’t really had an
outrageous issue that people have got»
ten upset about,” when such an issue
comes up, some feel the cabinet will
have more problems.

But most of the cabinet members
are confident that they will be able to
work together and work out com-
promises Which will be acceptable.
Only time will show if they are
right—but at the moment the cabinet
is off to a good start.

ly organizing an ad hoc committee
study a draft of a constitution that-was
prepared and approved two years ago,
only to be rejected by then-President-1
A. Richard Turner. “I feel me thought
of that draft is substantially correct
and that with some changes, it has a
good chance of passing,” he says.
”It’s certainly better than what we 1
have now.” '

He also would like to see the Educa-
tional Policy Committees (EPCS) in f
curricular matters. ”I'd like to see i '
them as more than just the social arm
of the department," he says.

Turnbull is certainly more active
than was his immediate predecessor
in the vice presidential office. This has
led to a charge from some that he has
“expanded the vice presidential role.”
This charge is denied by both Turnbuli
and other cabinet members.

“I'm just trying to live up to the
lullest capabilities of my job," he
says. 9
