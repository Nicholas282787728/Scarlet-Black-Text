very sexist views of women,

The chorus of Birth Control was
believed by several people to be ex-
tremely objectionable: ”It's birth con-
trol/She knows what to do/It’s hirth
control/She wants to screw/It's birth
control/And it's all in her head/She‘s
a slab of meatican't you see that
spread?"

Masterman. who wrote the lyrics for
Birth Control and every other original
except one, feels that people should
not react so negatively to the song. He
says, “There's no offense intended in
the song...the ‘ofiensive' songs are
about ste eotypes.,.lt‘s a mental thing
in her mind: we're not saying that all
women go to bars to have sexual rela-
tions. or that any woman who uses
birth control is a slab of meat...it’s
about one stereotype that may or may
not exist..,l haven’t met any...”

But critics claim that even if no or—
{ense is intended, the music is still of-
tensive. They say that the stereotype
is a very real thing and that many
women are working against this im-
age. Because the stereotype is so
prevalent, many people are easily ol—
lended by such songs as Birth Control
and Airhead, which includes such lines
as: ‘A balloon for a brain/Forgets her
own name/Too stupid to be
real...She’s an airhead/Her brain is
dead/She is dumb as hell but good in
bed/What an airhead."

Grinker, who composed most of the
original music, delends Airhead by
saying it's hot meant to be taken
seriously: “Airhead is intended to be a
iunny song it has a boppy beat,”

But the critics still feel that the
music reflects a chauvanistic attitude
on the part of band members. Come
merits made by some oi the band
members during a recent interview do
give some basis for this opinion;
however, other band members seemed
quite sincere in their statements denyr
mg such charges.

As Briggs points out. ”People can
and do take things the wrong way
There are a lot of very serious people
here..,"

Aalbers adds tllat “the lyrics are
kind ol’ satire on other types of music,
including punk rock.“

That may be one of the problems in
the discussion of sexism in Dentlsts'
songs: people do not understand the
genre in which the Dentists are perlor.

“fun” music that made bands like The

classics: they poke tun at both the
stereotype and the person who holds
the stereotype.

At the bottom line, Dentists' music
is tun, as was much oi early rock ’n'
roll. The melody and harmonies in
Airhead sound a bit like the classic
hits oi groups like the Beach Boys or
the Beatles. The tunes are pleasant
and the words are catchy, it
sometimes bordering on oirensive.

Even disco fans can get down and
boogie to The Dentist sound. Says
disco expert Dave Blatt, “When i saw
Rude up there thrusting and getting
down, i couldn't help mysell. i had vi-
sions 01 Glen Hughes all over again."

But there’s more to the Dentists'
popularity than that Like other New
Wave bands, the Dentists are high
energy, and the energy is apparent. it
was this level or energy—a level that
New Wave bands round wanting in the
more established bands like the Rol’»
ing Stonesithat characterized the
early 'st bands.

On stage, the energy translates ,
mainly into Masterman, who prances,
thrusts, Jumps, and does just about
everything else with a degree or gusto,
that is genuinely refreshing. The
moves that in many rock stars have
become tired idioms are real in
Masterman.

Briggs also has a high degree ol
stage energy. He says that he has
been heavily inllueiiccd by The Who's
