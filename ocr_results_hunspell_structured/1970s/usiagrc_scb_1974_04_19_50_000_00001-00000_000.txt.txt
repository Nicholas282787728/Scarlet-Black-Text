Pet Policy Altered

ions nature of the complaints rece-
ived by the pet board. Dean of St-
udent Affairs Jim Tedermlln expl-
ained that dogs were terrorizing
both members of the campus com-
munity and local residents, while
creating a general nuisance,Neither
the pet patrol nor dog—catchers real—
istically could handle the situation.

Though some concern tor the wel—
rare or the dogs was expressed, the
majority or those attending saw a
more serious problem in the grie-
vances they were causing. Co~op
dogs were cited as a major sour.
ce of harrassmsnt to the townspe-
ople.

With the mnmh~long morawrluTl
due to expire this week, SPsn
brought their DmpDSal to SGA for
endorsement. Reports or faculty and
Starf opposition to the moratorium
pmmpted further discussion despite
a referendum showing favorable St-
udent reaction to the lax leash law.

student reactions and related
aspects of the new leashpolicy.

‘Sellerighteous dog owners need
to be reminded that pets are a pri-
Vilege, not a right," Rick Faust,
mnmher of the pet board, empha—
sized. “There is a misconception
among dog owners that they need
to run dogs on campus. The leash
law would encourage more people
to minke use of areas oil-campus.
It is not an oppressive measure.”

In further action, the Joint Board
Voted to reconsider an amendment
on student rights and responsibil—
ities at next Wednesdavls meeting.
Dibble representative Roxane Br-
own specifically objected to the no-
knock policy included in the amend-
mmlt to the 73-74 Student Handbook
section on student rights. Brown‘s
chief Concern was that the student
body had not beenproperly consulted

on such an important matter. SGA'

plans to publicize the issue ani
hold an open rorum at next weelr’s
moo-tog.
