something he felt needed to be
changed. James expressed a “will-
ingness to commit time, energy and
talent” in the formation of an “ac»
tive student lobby.” James citedthe
need for ”progressive regenera-
tion" in the areas of political or
ganization, academic and social life,
and student services.

in maintaining efficiency in gov»
ernment, James felt that unless an
issue carried major import the work
should be done in the committees
and “rubber-stamped” by SGA. Ja-
mes also saw the need for incor
poration of the social co—ordinator
in the SGA cabinet. He also noted
the vast human andphysicalresour»
ces that go unrealized at the college
and the need to utilize them to their
fullest potential.

“The goals you've heard here are
fine, but SGA can’t do it now,"
John Potts stated in his candid pres
sentation. ”I think SGA needsa good
swift kick in the tail bone.”

Potts on the basis or two years'
work with SGA felt he “knows where
the strengths and weaknesses ofSGA
are” and this would enable to make
his desired changes. “I think
we need changeﬁviolent change—-
viable change.”

SGA's difficulty, Potts {elt, was not
that it didn't know what 'its goals
were, but didn’t know how to ob
tain them. Potts said that he would
like to “cut out the bullshit and
put in some power.”

In order to make the committee
structure viable, Potts suggested
appointed committee co-ordinators
to look over blocks committees to
see that they were getting their work
done. ”We need to transform SGA
into a viable active force around
here."

Michele Rathenburg in her pre-
sentation focused mainly on aca—
demic issues. She felt there was
a need tor “investigating faculty
and student rights about grading
and work loads.” In lieu of this,
a re-examination of pass—fail is in
order.

Michele also suggests that the
course syllabus and list at readings
should be available to students be-
fore registration to aid students in

that she felt this would give her an

The final candidate, Ellen Yacknln,
saw the major problem of SGA as
a lack of communication between
committees and students. “Theonly

adequately with two members and
without a significant financial com-
mitment to such “glamor” pro-
grams as television and film, which
involve expensive equipment.

The low priority ofglamor courses
was reiterated by Instructor Pat
Kent, who teaches courses in that
area.

She said Communications could
be taught without these programs,
just as “it is possible to teach
English without having students wr—
ite novels."

Kent also accused Voertman of
believing that Communciations was
more a specialized application of
cipline in its own right. Voertman
had commented that the College
was an inappropriate setting ior a
Communications curriculum, coma
paring it to fields such as Geology
and Engineering.

Several faculty members came to
the defense of the department. At
one point Assistant Professor of
Theatre Bruce Halverson noted that
the Council in its rationale had re-
ferred to the “able and eloquent"
defense of the students in previous
meetings with the council. “Anyr
thing that will help us be eloquent
and able should receive first pri—
ority," said Halverson.

Following intensive efforts by Gor-
rell and other students in the Come
munications department, the largest
number of students to attend a fac»
ulty meeting in over two years was

present, Despite a guarantee trom

Leggett that anyone who wanted to
could speak, few students otherthan
Gorrell and SGA cabinet members
did $0,

The vast majority oi the students,
however, clearly supported Gorr-
ell’s position. His comments and
those of faculty members favoring
the department were lrequently inc
terrupted by applause.

The sentiments of the faculty were
not as clear, in the absence of a
vote, but most who spoke in lavor
of the Council’s recommendation
or in defense of its rationale were
Council members. Several laculty
outside members of the Communi»
cations department did voice some
support or the students positions,
particularly on what SGA Vice Pr-
esident John Pfeffer called the lack
of available data on “what priorr
ities are and who determines them.”

when the faculty does vote on the

Executive Council’s recommendati-
on, its action will constitute an “op-
inion" which will be related to the
Trustees. Their action could techs
nically neither confirm nor pre<
vent dropping the department.

/moral matter. In recent years,
leaders of the New Left as well as
other “progressive” individuals
have levelled a number of serious
charges against traditionally-oriem
ted Jews, against Jewish nation-
alism, and particularly against Is-
rael. Prof. Leiser finds no sound
basis tor these accusations, andar-
gues the legitimacy ol Jewish na-
tionalism as a political movement.

The second lecture or the Program
will be or a more spiritual vein
and should prove no less provoca—
tive. Sunday, at 3:00 p.ni., Rabbi
Arthur Green will discuss Redis-
covering Jewish Mysticism Today.
Art Green is a member of the Ha-
vurat shalom community, an exper-
iment in Jewish religious and comm-
unal renewal, which he helped to
found in 1968. He is presentlywork—
ing on a doctorate at Brandeis Un~
iversity on the Jewish mystical tra<
ditlon.

Art Green’s talk will focus oncer-
tain central symbols in thelanguage
of Jewish spirituality, and what
their recovery might mean to the
contemporary religious situation.
Its orientation will be personal and
open to discussion, and will un—
doubtedly not be lacking in Hasidic
stories.

The entertainment segment of the
Program will be provided tonight.
First, the weekly Oneg Shabbat will
be combined with Israeli folk danc-
ing in North Lounge at 7:00 pm

Also tonight, at 9:30, aconcertwill
be given by Yacov Dan in South
Lounge, Yacov Dan is an lsraeli
singer, actor, and musician, widely
acclaimed in Israel and the U.S.
He will accompany himself on the
cordovox.

Finally, the Jewish Cultural Pros
grain is presently the Academy
