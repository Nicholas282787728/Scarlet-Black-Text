game {or Grinnell and was touched
ior six hits and iive earned runs. He
walked five and struck out three.
and deiense behind him made three
errors. Coe lead 3-0 until the ﬁfth.
when Delaney was victimized by
three unearned runs. Coe added two
more in their last atrbat.

Wes Fujii started the second game
and went iour innings. Although
Coe scored ﬁfteen runs oiiFujii, the
Pioneers made six errors behind
him and consequently. only ﬁve of
the iiiteen runs were earned. Fujii
was tagged ior ten hits and walked
six, while striking out two, Dave
Gates came in to pitch the iiith and
struck out the iirst batter he iaced.

Saﬂey. Grinnell's win was nabbed
hy the Ream/Lee duo, winning a,-
late aiternoon doubles contest 32,

Grinnell’s first meet against Wil-

of inclement weather on the 4th
Captains oi this year's squad ar-
Dave Wright and Dave Raub. Wrigh
is a line long and triple jumpe
while Raub is a good distanceman.

A lZ-team lield is expected fol-the
meet, which is set tor 1 pm. Sa-
turday at the North Field oval.

Luther, Lords, and One look like
the best bets to displace Northeast
Missouri State, the 1973 titlist. The
Missouri outfit, which will notcom-
pete this year, completelydolninated
lhe 1973 proceedings, piling up no
points to second place Luther’s 81.
Coe took tourth a year ago with
64 markers

Central, William Penn, and Wart—
hurg should also iinisn among the
leaders. The ﬁeld will be rounded
out by Cornell. Dubuque, Grinnell,
Knox, Monmouth, and Simpson.

The chase for individual titles
promises to be wide open as Lu-
ther’s Tim Williamson is the only
deiending champion, He copped the
1»mile and 3-mile runs a year ago.

Another standout is Coe’s Kip K0-
rir. He placed second in the triple
jump last Spring, but is capable
oi scoring points in just about any
event on the card.

Grinnell’s lone returning pointget-
ter iron] the 1973 event is David
Wright (Northiield, Mm). He was
fifth in the long jump and sixth
in the triple jump,

Other Pioneer possibilities for pc-
ints this time around are Mark B]—
anchard (Fords, Null), middle 11
tance; David Raul) (Minneapolis,
Mn), distance; and Chip Hall (Jun-
ction City, on), javelin.
