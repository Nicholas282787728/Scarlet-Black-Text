Every morning at 4:00 am, Don‘

“Mose” Killian begins Work in the
PEC. Grinnell College doesn't
require that Killion begin work at
such outrageously early hours;
he does. He insists that he cannot
sleep so instead of wasting time in
bed he starts his PEC chores early
by drying the athletic teams’
laundry.

His work Continues behind the
Cage until all his duties have been
completed. A conscientious
worker, Mose Killion rarely leaves
the PEG belore 4:00 pm.

Mose Killinn’s value to the
athletic department can never be
calculated. Head Athletic Director
John Piitsch says, “He is in
valuable, we can’t afford to lose
him. I know no one is invaluable . ..
but he is as close to invaluable as
anyone could be. He is the gut of
the outfit.”

This year the athletic depart-
ment stumbles upon some serious
problems as Mose Killion plans to
retire sometime before 1978, At 62
years or age and after over 45
years of employment. his plans for
retirement are understandable,

When asked ll he looked torward
to retirement, he openly admitted,
“No, I don’t look foward to
retirement, but am just doing it.
Heck," he c0ntirlued,"l don’t want
to (leave), but it's getting sol can‘t
take it anymore."

The thoughtof working since the
age of sixteen terrifies many of the
intellectuals on campus, But Mose
Killion, employed ever since he
was a young man, began work in
the coal mines around Madrid,
Iowa. He worked there for nine
years until the work became too
tough to handle. Killion’s only

comment about the coal camps is,

"if you want slavery, that’s a good

After leaving Madrid, Mose
joined Weitz Construction, a
company not unlamiliar to
Grinnell College. This work
required trequent movings, which
Mose and his tamiiy could not

athletic equipment. His interest in
athletics is second to none; he
continually participates as a
spectator in almost all Grinnell
College athletic events. He admits
to enjoying athletics and says he
enjoys working [or the athletic
department more than any other
department at Grinnell,

His interest in athletics began as
a youth and zenithed when he
played baseball in a local sandlot
league. His high school didn’t have
a baseball program. He reminisces
about his pitching days, “when l
was sixteen I turned down a
Cardinal contract. They oriered
me $100 a month with room and
board. it was good money lor those
days but I was stubborn and kept
telling them that i wanted to play
lor the Yankees, Three times they
oriereo me a chance, but I told
them I wanted to play for the
Yankees.” Two years after these
offers, Mose threw his arm out and
retired to the professional softball
leagues around Madrid.

He has been on the job every
weekday at 4:00 am. since he
began work with the College in
1942. Tom Latimer, Director at
Recreational Facilities and Ser-
vices, ilatly states, “He literally
does two people’s work; I say this
just from the hours he works.
There is not a soul in the college
who puts in more hours.”

Mose Killion offers more to the
college than long hours, His ex-
cellent rapport with the students
and {acuity cannot be overem-
phasized. The frequent lack or
respect he receives from the
athletes can never be excused. The
