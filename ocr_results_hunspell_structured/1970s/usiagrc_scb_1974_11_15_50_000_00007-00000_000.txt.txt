By John llerslley

Younker Memorial Health
Center was possibly the busiest its
been In years Nov. 7 when ap-
proximately so people trooped m
and out for free wine [which ran
out early), cheese and crackers
(which did not), and general
conversation during an open house
about the aims and functions of the
sexuality counseling group which
is now based in a back wmg room
0! the health Center, In all. the
evening was termed a success by
the group members who have been
working together in order to get
this service established and
moving.

To date we have not been as
active as we would like to have
been, but we do wish to become
more involved in the life of the
Grinnell community. In addition,
we hope to provide what we feel is
both a necessary and vital lunar
tion Although we are not
protessionally traincd counselors,
we have had a considerable
amount of education which has

been aimed not only at counseling.
but also lullilling the need {or in-
Iormational and reierral services,

At the present time the room is
stalled 6 days a week (Sunday
Thursday ircm 7:30-9:00 and
Saturdays irom zoo-4:00). We are
also available by phone and our
numbers are listed on a
minieographed sheet next to most
hall extensions.

The room itsell has some books
and pamphlets on various aspects
and problems oi human sexuality.
We are in the process of ordering
more literature and there is no
extensive bibliography which
Includes women’s, men’s, and gay
consciousness literature. Still
other material can be round in
section 396 or Burling Library.

Alter much work and organi-
zatlonal procedures, wc are alive
and well and living in the health
center. We are here to listen, to
care. and hopeiully, to help, Feel
iree to use us and the room as
resources.
