Dentel rejects NOW

aid initiative on salary

By Kathy Willhoite

Programs and Activites Conn»
selor Georgia Dentel has decided
to pursue her salary grievance
case through administrative
channels rather than seek the
support of various Affirmative
Action groups on campus.

Dentel has decided to pursue the
issue through the usual path of
those discontented with their
salaries—through Dean Waldo
Walker. ”I am in the process at the
moment of pursuing it with the
administration, but I have no in
dication what the results will be,"
she said. She called her approach
“a matter of courtesy."

THIS PAST week, she contacted
the Affirmative Action Advisory
Committee (a faculty-student
committee chaired by education
department head Roberta Atwell)
with this information. Atwell
agreed with Dentel’s ,decision,
saying that by having the com=
mittees intervene on her behalf
before going through adr
ministrative channels, Dentel
would be “bypassing the persons
with control over the issue."

Jeanne Burkle, chairman of the
Affirmative Action Task Force of
the Grinnell Chapter of the
National Organization for Women,
prepared a statement about one
month ago on Dentel's case that
was sent to the Affirmative Action
committees of the Student
Government Association and
Concerned Black Students, and to
the Affirmative Action Advisory
Committee.

TIlE STATEMENT discussed
implementation of Affirmative
Action regarding Grinnell adr
ministrative salaries in general
and Dentel’s case in particular.
Dentel had been the developer and
director of Grinnell's social and
cultural activities programs for 16
years when she was fired in
August, i976, along with GORP
director Kathy McCluskey and
Dean of the Curriculum Mary
Eysenbach Dentel and McCluskey

were later rehired on a partstime
basis with lowered salaries.

Greg Wiggins, CBS president,
and Jon Neiderbach, SGA
president, each responded to
NOW‘s statement by offering
support. The Affirmative Action
Advisory Committee, perhaps the
most lniluential of the committees,
has not taken any action or applied
any pressure to the administration
yet: “We’d be very remiss under
the circumstances to pursue the
issue because of a letter from
NOW," said Atwell.

BURKLE, however, is ready ior
active intervention by all of the
Affirmative Action committees
now. Id like to take Greg Wiggins
by one hand and Jon Neiderhach
by the other, go to Waldo Walker,
and ask Ior an explanation,” she
said, Since Dentel has decided to
rectify her situation through ads
ministrative channels, Burkle said
NOW can take no further action on
the issue. ”We're paralyzed," she
said. “Our hands are completely
tied." She hopes that Dentel will
present her case to Walker as
soon as possible so that any
necessary action can get un-
derway.

NOW has been concentrating on
Dentelis case, viewing it as a
crucial test of the administration’s
commitment to a concrete.
ongoing Affirmative Action policy.

ATWELL SAID that one of the
reasons her committee has taken
no direct action on the Dentel case
yet is that it has been waiting to
consider a status report on Afr
firmative Action progress at
Grinnell which was issued over a
week ago by William Barrett,
college Vicesi’rovost and Af-
firmative Action officer. Atwell's
committee will discuss the report
at its meeting today. Atwell said
the committee‘s approach is to
pursue discrepancies in the
salaries of all women and
minorities at Grinnell without

 

specifically focusing on Dentel's
case

Alcohol use examined

alcoholic problems" according to
Strange. Problem drinking is
similar to a disease in many ways.
but the greater potential to control
it makes it very different. All
alcoholics go through an “Alcohol
Abuse Cycle.” -
THE CYCLE begins with e .
cessivealcohol use This interferes
with the person's life. Guilt
feelings surface. Tolforget this
guilt, the victim drinks moreiand
the circle goes on. “The only way
to break the cycle,” Strange
asserts, ”1510 stop the use of the

drug."

But Strange is not a
prohibitionist He admits that
moderate use of alcohol is en-
joyable and relaxing, But for a
problem drinker he sees abr
stinence as the only solution.

THE BIGGEST problem with
alcohol, Strange ’said, is that
people lack knowledge about its
power and eiiect. Even though the
subject has enjoyed recent
prominence at Grinnell, few
students here apparently felt the
need to gain that knowledge. About
a dozen, concerned or curious,
attended Strange’s lecture.

Letters to the editor

Don‘t expect a rose garden

Tattle editor: For some Weeks now
1 have been receiving the Scarlet
and Black in the mail and although
I didn’t order the rag I read it with
more than casual interest
nowadays,

I suppose that I'd better in-
troduce myself, In the early sixties
I was Grinnell’s racial
troubleshooter and my‘ column,
“Shades of Gray" caused no small
amount of consternation among
the student body and alumni.

The reason I‘m Writing is that
there is a person out there who
could use my help. It had occurred
to me to Write him personally but I
think that my letter might go into

his trashbasket, I thiilk that Curtis ,

Cost has some growing up to do,

It’s too bad, man, because you‘ve
come to thewrong place to be quite
so angry. As far as I can
remember, life at Grinnell was
certainly worth the application, if
not a whole lot more. No, they may
not be halcyon days but who the
hell promised you a rose garden?

Last spring when I received a
long distance phone call from
members of CBS bemoaning the
situation at Grinnell, it was very
difficult for me to say exactly what
I would have liked to I suppose
that the best advice would have
been to have Written a letter to the
philosophy department asking it,
independent of the black studies
department, to institute an upper
level seminar entitled “Nigger " It
probably would have missed its
mark, even among those ambitious
scholars willing to probe the infra-
existential suggestion.

While Mr. Cost, probably and
foremost, understands what it may
mean to be black, he has yet to
fathom What it means to be a
“nigger." Far from being
epigrammatic, let me say that it is
wholly respectable to be black and
although Mr. Cost has probably
responded to the word “nigger," he
has surely never been one.

CBS should start making more
friends, nght now. The war is

the freedom to choose en-
vironments and ideas. Carl Gray

Misleading
headline

To the editor: Foul! Your 5&1} lead
story headline bl Nov, 13 reading,
“College has 35.6 million in S.
African stocks" is a bummer and
misleading.

This reader was led to believe
that a substantial portion of
Grinnell's portfolio was invested in
de Beers, South African utilities,
etc. Upon closer reading, deep into
the story, i discovered Grinnell‘s
ownership of American corporate
stocks was the topic of the story.
These corporations do business in
South Africa as well as dozens of
other countries throughout the
world.

Although I generally believe the
SM; does a consistent job (a pretty
good one) of fair and represen-
tative editing and heading. this
front page head was faulty jours
nalism. Peter Ma)”

Deserves
normal meal

To the edi r: At the Joint Boards
meeting of Nov. 22, Mr. Jon
Neiderbach proposed, and the SGA
passed, a resolution to sponsor a
meatless supper on Nov. 28, We
who ate this meal owe him
prolound gratitude, as does the
food service, which served us white
rice and beans and undoubtedly
saved a Int of money. However, it
seems to me that I was entitled to a
normal meal, since I had paid for
one, and that if I wish to become a
vegetarian I should do so of my
own volition. Clay Jenkins
