Open Space

by Bob Greenberg
As a new semester begins. one
cannot avoid the habit of
remembering the good drunks and
the two day allrnightels without a
smile. Unfortunately a smile does
not return when I remember the
performance of the SGA last
semester. The members of the
SGA. and more specifically the
president. have not addressed nor
solved the problems that have
continually plagued the SGA. This
problem proves to be more of a
disappointment to me than the C I
received last semester.

The present constitution of the
SGA does not state the purpose of
the body. I am afraid that the Joint
Boards interprets the sole role of
the SGA as a funds supplier for the
various campus activities. The‘
lirst question to be asked when the
SGA is considering appropriating
money for an event is. “do we have
enough money?” I would like to

 

 

remind the Joint Boards that the
question should not be, ”do we
have enough money.” but rather.
“is the expenditure worth while
and are the students getting their
money's worth?”

1r 1 AM right in my assumption.
the members of the Joint Boards
View the SGA as a bank with
380.000 to give away. I must
congratulate the members of the
Joint Boards for holding to their

philosophies. since the SGA has'

managed to spend all of the ‘money
appropriated for the iirst semester
without getting the proper results.

Ifyou will remember. I made the
statement that last semester’s
SGA had no major ac-
complishments. This is not only the
fault of the Joint Boards but. it is
also the fault of the president, Jon
has not taken the leadership role
that he should have. and hence,
during meetings the members
have tended to be Verbose and to
drift off the subject at hand. While
I have trouble remembering the
accomplishments of last
semester’s SGA. I have no problem
in naming its shortcomings.

FOR example. thanks to Jon and
other members of the Joint
Boards. the college has a new
Affirmative Action committee.
with the addition of this com-
mittee. Grinnell College cannot
only boast that it is the only college
in the United States to have two
Truman scholars, but it can now
boast that it is the only college in
the whole country to have live
Affirmative Action committees.
That's right. five. Talk about
bureaucracy? And you know what
else. not one of them has done
much to improve the present
situation at Grinnell.

Another one of SGA’S follies can
be found In its handling of the
alcohol issue. After almost a
semester of not having an alcohol

President, SGA fail students

policy, the Joint Boards have
succeeded in creating a policy that
does not solve the problems that it
was intended to. The SGA has not
solved the problem of the college
being liable if a student gets drunk
at an all-campus party and then
gets into a car accident. Nor does
the present SGA policy address the
problem oi the money spent on
hard liquor. AS a matter of fact it is
conceivable that the SGA could
spend more money on hard liquor
for the Loose Hall Ball than it did
for the James Gang Bang,

JON'S INABILITY to handle the
SGA can be seen when We
look to his handling of the Kent
State affair and the South African
issue. After spending more than a
month discussing these two. no
money was given tothe people
going to Kent State. and the
trustees virtually overlooked the
SGA proposal concerning South
Africa. A whole month wasted. In
that month we could have solved
the Affirmative Action problem.
solved the problem of coordinating
the EPC's. concerned ourselva
with professor tenure and more
responsibly addressed the
problems facing the students of
.Grinnell.

Jon has further perpetuated the
problem of student apathy by
allowing a student to sit on three or
four committees rather than
getting as many students as
possible involved in student
govemment.

UNDER Jon's leadership. the
SGA has become a reactive body
rather than a progressive one. This
trend will continue as long as the
altruistic true believers of the SGA
Continue to hinder the main tuner
tion of the SGA which is to concern

itself With the needs and desires of
the students of Grinnell.

Flora, fauna practice subversion

There are many chages taking
place in America today. some
subtle. some very blatant and
obvious. Most of these changes
concern the future of America. its
government. industry and plastic
underthings production I’d like to
use today’s column to point out two
oi these menacing. subversive
changes.

In the results of the recent
elections in a few states. Lichen
was elected into public office. In
Boo PooBee (pronounced Boo
PooBee) Louisiana. for example. a
clump of licheniunder the alias of
Homer “Grease" Chesthurts~was
elected to the office of town
Chairman. In Chaslow. Rhode
Island. a small mound of lichen
won the office of city clerk from the
incumbent. Harriet “No Teeth”
Sodaplodski. And the most un-
believable story of all comes from
Franklin. North Carolina.

IN THIS small mining town, a
very large piece of lichen7
disguised as a chickenitook the
oiiice oi mayor and is now running
the town with the help of moss.
mold. and a pair ol old socks, I
talked With the pair of socks and
asked him why the lichen disguised
itself as a chicken. “Well. Franklin
didn’t want his mother to know he
was running ior office. since she
thinks politics is a dirty bag of
tricks.”

So far. the town is running
quietly. although there have been
rumors of a small faction of town

lint organizing a coup d‘etat and
taking over the city. The line has to
be drawn somewhere in political
eligibility and I think it should be
drawn at lint.

THERE is a second change I
would like to point out.

in the old good ole days. when
catching wild African or
Mongolian sheep. one would have
to dress up as a train conductor
and taunt the sheep until they were
angry enough to get on your train.
(why sheep get on trains when
they're angry. no one seems to
know.) Then you would run the
train intoabrick Wall at high speed
and pick up all of the dead sheep.
That's how it used to be done.

But now these sheep won’t fall
ior the train-into-therwall bit;
They've gotten smarter. So big
industry has gotten the idea of
using elves tor baiting the new
sheep traps (giant gourd-shaped

buildings. filed with monks who
humiliate the sheep into sub
consciousness). These cute little
men (sheep only go {or the men;
female elves have [our nostrils)
are glued to beach blankets in front
oi the door oi the sheep trap. Then
they are iorccd to sing “The
Herring Song.” Needless to say.
sheep from miles around come
running in and our friendly
crooners are trampled in the
stampede. I think it is time to stop
this wanton bruising of defenseless
little men who deserve much better
than singing nonsensical garbage
in Bermuda shorts.

Old timer can’t

learn new

I'm not sure I like being that
animal known as a second
semester senior.

After waking irom my. final long
winter's slumber. l reluctantly
returned to this menagerie of some
1200 assorted, exotic species oi
students and educators. I soon
began to feel more like an old dog
having to learn new tricks.

LIKE A spry pup. I trotted into
the Forum grill early this week. all
setto chow down a Grinnellburger.
I was psyched up to perform my
usual set of tricks. But I soon
discovered I could no longer
perform the old “drop the chopped
onions in the catsup and mustard"
trick. Nor could I do the “Sprinkle
the salt over everything but the
french fries trick."

Instead. I had to learn (after
getting my paws greasy from the
french fries) to tear open little
packages of catsup and mustard
with my teeth. And I also learned
to fetch my burger from a tiny
hole in what appears to be a very
large doghouse. How inhumane,

1 NEXT scampered off to the
library to do the old reserve
reading trick. But it's a new trick
altogether now.

Surprise. surprise! No reserve
iiles in the card catalog. 1 prac»
tically got down on all fours looking
for it. Then I remembered the
computer printouts scattered on
the reserve desk and the new TV
like box there (I'd thought cirr
culation desk was a boring job, but
not that boring!). Putting two and
two together I scurried to the desk
where I learned my part of the new
trick in a jiiiy,

tricks

"All! Automation! Progress! It
now seems to take one computer
and two or three Circus attendants
longer to find one book than one
clown who used to juggle three at
once. I guess the trick just needs
work.

Not only are there new tricks to
learn upon coming back. but there
have been a few changes in our
cages and in our habitat to adapt to
aswell. Among us old timers. a few
feathers have been rufﬂed.

AS previously mentioned. there's
the new Forum facades. or should i
say fortress The structure ap
pears to be designed to protect
those working behind it from
volatile hoardes of hungry
students. Comments on the
structure have ranged from apr
pealing (respondent was a comr
pulsive graffiti Scribbler) to ap-
palling.

One very important change is not
to be taken so lightly. That is the
absence of Dave Matlack. better
known as Forum Dave. Dave took
ill over break and spent a few
nights in the hospital. A recep
tionist at the Mayﬂower Home‘s
health center reported that Dave
had developed pneumonia with
complications. He is recovering at
the health center now. and is
happily reported to be resting
comfortably. getting up and
around well Until he returns to the
nest. he will be missed.

ANOTHER sort of friend did not
lare so well, however. Gaylord. the
dubious dog (what animal could
rightly love humans so much?) is
gone forever. It may take a while

 

for this old dog to get used to that;
