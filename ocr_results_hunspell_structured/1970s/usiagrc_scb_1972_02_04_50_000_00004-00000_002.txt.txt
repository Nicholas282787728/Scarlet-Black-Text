CHARLATAN

You've said words to me. I will not turn my

back on them, such as they are, a teeble first

step outward, Though you crouch alone in one

small chrysalis sewn tight about you with

yesterday’s Linus blanket, I can appreciate

that. I know about your need (or security,

You have metamorphosed beIore today's

prison-cell, from thumbsucking t0 bedroom

doorslamming and on to high skirts and talse

eyelashes with your testing lips. And now today

you huddle at my feet in mute softness of your own

making. But will you never shed the cold

shrouds for someone like me, and put your

tender sell in view for me to touch? I promise

not to strike any unguarded nerve you hare.

I’ve told you this before.

You did one minute ago say

words to me, extending hrieily one timid

finger from a peek-a-boo slit in your waiting

world. It’s now my turn, you've handed

over the slate. For a while l’Il etch dreams

[or you I'll mold some clever message

stuttering in a poet’s mad foxtrot

across the blank page. I‘ll reach out unairaid.

I know you need to he touched and kindly

squeezed, exploring long walledaup caves and tears.

My hands are warm and not rough. But still

your daned glance says all this is a tool's

handiwork, a basket weaved ill bedlam and I’m an
overeager charlatan dressed in irayed knickers

and grandpa’s dreadnought two sizes too big. Let's

have a long guiiaw together. I’m rebuilding Champs
Elysee’s with shredded reams oi paper mache; rm
fording frothy streams in rafts of curtain rod and baked
clay. I'm cutting up Christ's woven cloak to sew in seams,
It seems to you a naked absurdity, like

Something old men cackle over in Playboy Club smoking
rooms. i try to stick a sure straightpin thru the

tiny belly oi your swooping moth. I try to paint our minds
meanderings in oil-white or build a tight

box about these smoky reveries in a color, a length

a moist sibillance or degree of volume.

We often tried pouring thoughts into clear jerohoams

on the sheli to jail ior you. Until today one minute

hence I’ve failed You See the nature of our uttered words
as nearly worthless, stumbling couriers from minds to
men, inept at best. at worst a horror iarce, toddler

{or a Dali landscape or Goya’s twisted races. “Los desastres
de la guerra.” The tragedies and tumblings-over oi speech.
My very words breath a freeze on all I wish to say. I accept
the humility of communication however - it’s man’s own
sweet curse, (But have you ever mused, did God employ
a iautty conjugation in the Genesis? ‘Que risa que seria!)
My words are servile, chapiallen, but they must he said
You say they are lost wisps of gypsy Steam. I believe I’ve
skipped a touchstone and rippled the deep well’s surface
of our dreamt Please

see me through eyes without dread, instead take a

hand or two and let’s stumble and grape together with our
words. We’ll be a pair of meek ones, modest Charlatans and
unpinned butterﬂys, We'll laugh a lot together,

and we will smile cautiously at malaprops and split iniinitives.

the mind Is cataleptic

these words are merely symptomatic twitchings
that iorbode my static manlas

my hands are limher

and my toes have their own ill-Clipped independence
but my mental limbs Sprawl stricken,

not atrophied—

bizarre,

sellesculpted in absentia

by the working definition of myself

which plays it all unmoving:

artist, critic, patron

and institution

its endless disjunction revealed

by metaphor.

BREAKNECK CREEK

dangerously named
this water has always seemed cold

it wraps itseli
around this land and me
snaking its way through the trees

there is only one bridge
that I know oi

only one approach
crossing its path

we have thrown stones ‘
ironi that hridge
overlooking the water

into the water
waiting tor water
to come and encircle them

and turtles die there
coming on to the road
turtles are stones

snakes were hidden there as well
and we knew that
their bite was deadly

everyone used to laugh
when I wouldn’t even touch
pictures oi snakes

they didn’t believe me
yet still the icar persists

I know that
those pictures are real
that they contain venom

but I try to drown out my {ears
as the water will to the snakes
rising in the spring

the bridge collapsed last year
when the creek ncoded
