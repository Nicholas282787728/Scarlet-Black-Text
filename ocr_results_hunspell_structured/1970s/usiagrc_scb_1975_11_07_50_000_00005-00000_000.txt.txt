Lightning riffs in blindfold test

by Jeffrey Miller

One night over break, I was
sitting in my room listening to old
Dave Brubeck records and
rereading Dan Hexter’s “blindfold
test” with Charlie Davis when the
lira struck me: Why not have my
own blindfold test? I set out in
search of a respected musician on
campus—preferably someone
.fsed in old acoustic blues, as
that is my favorite genre, My
search appeared to be in vain7
until Friday night, when, at the
Hub, i had the great fortune of
‘l‘king to blues guitarist Lighting
Riffs Waldner.

Lightning Riffs, blinded at the
age oi twelve while impersonating
the Three Stooges in a synagogue
talent show, is one of the last of the
great Delta bluesmen. With his
brother, harpist Sonny Boy
Waldner, he has toured the South
[or the past twentyone years
playing the blues. He has two solo
a ums—l Don't Play No
Gregorian Chants and Blues
Against the Empire. He also has
two albums with his band, the Bay

Bomber57Brcak That Jam
and Pass the Reds, I Got the Blues

Lightning Riffs and I left the Pub
and returned to my room for the
blindfold test. As Lightning Riffs is

.itless, I decided to forego the
formality ola blindiold and merely
seated him near my tape recorder
The purpose of the blindfold test,
as Dan Hexter has previously
pointed out, is to interview an

unidentified recordings in order to
get a sense of that artist’s
historical, conceptual, and
philosophical “roots" as ‘they
relate to his»her music. The
records are used as a starting point
for whatever reminiscences
philosophy the artist may wish to
discuss.

The first record I those was
Mute Boy Lincoln’s ”Speak No
Evil” (Wazoo NCC-l701). Mute
Boy’s main axe was the kazoo;
however, he lost his larynx at an
early age, thus rendering his kazoo
playing a bit less powerful.
Needless to say, this accident also
affected his vocals. ”Speak No
Evil" consists of some thirty—eight
minutes oi speaker hiss, oc-
casionally interrupted by the
somewhat vulgar sound of Mute
Boy attempting to play the kazoo
as onemighta trombone, or, in one
case, a kettledrum,

Lightning Riffs was not im-
mediately familiar with the
selection, spending some seven
minutes trying to decide whether
the recorded artist was Lou Reed
or Dmitri Shstakovich, Finall
though, the light dawned on hi

LR: Heyithat’s Mute Boy
Lincoln. I never heard him, but
Sonny Boy caught his act once in
Georgia. Said it \vas terrible.
Couldn’t for the life of him figure
out why some mute man would get
on stage and try to sing and play
kazoo,

JM: What about his piano

LR: What that man could do with
his nose . . , He was a great ins
fluence on me musicallyihe once
told me: “Son, if you Want to Write
the blues, just remember this one
wordicourvolsierr”

J t id you follow that advice?

LR: Hell, no. Everyone knows
that the two words you always use
when you write the blues are
”goddamn” and ”jellyroll.” Like
my songi“Goddamn Jellyroll
Blues,”

JM' Care to do a few bars“!

LR: Later, manilater.

Hey, manilisten to that. Sounds
worse than a wounded cat in heat.
JM: Yes, many people have said
that. How about his guitar work7
would you say that he
revolutionized blues guitar?

LR: No, not at all.

JM: What about his unusual
tunings”

LR: Well, I remember at his last
concert he tuned the top three
strings so high that only dogs could
hear them, and the bottom three so
low that only bees could hear them.

JM: What was the audience

05535 4116102954111

The next selection i chose for LR
was from Deaf Melon
Washington’s Wish You Were llcar
LP (WazooJBL-ZOOO), Deaf Melon
could never hear to time his guitar
properly, This resulted frequently
in a tuning in which, through either
picking or strumming, only white
noise was emitted. This white noise
guitar was augmented by Deaf
Melon’s unique voice, which has
often been compared to that of a
wounded cat 'in heatialways
unlavorably,

LR knew Deaf Melon's work
immediately:

LR: Oh, yeah—Deal Melon
Washington. Listen to that white

response?

LR: Well, they bit him and stung
him pretty bad, That’s why it was
his last concert,

JM: oh, I didn’t know that. What
about the Doppler slide guitar?

LR: You know, Deaf Melon
didn’t invent thatia popular
misconception. Orlando Yellow
whipped it up. Couldn’t iigure out
how to play regular slide, so he
found a long corridor and ran up
and down it playing one note. Sure
enough, old Yellow found out that
that note would go flat or sharp to
the audience, depending on which
way he ran. Called it the Doppler
slideil never knew why.

corporated that in his act'!

LR: Right, Of course, he could
never hear itihe just liked to run
around with his guitar. He was
kind of crazy—had syphilis bad. .

Words can’t describe the rest of
our conversation, mainly because
LR fell asleep during the final
selection his own I Don‘t Play No
Gregorian Chants (Wazoo ITY-
2525)7which, incidentally. he
failed to identify. Unfortunately
he never performed the moving
“Goddamn Jellyroll Blues"—
hnwever, in order to give an idea of
the sensitive artistry of Lightning
Riffs Waldner, we shall print the
first verse:

lthought I had done gone paid all
my dues

But when l woke up this morn-
ning there was jellyroll in my shoes

Don't you know right then I got
me

These Goddamn Jellyroll Blues

(Earth Shoes Music~19721

It was a rare pleasure for me to
sit down and talk the blues with a
reigning master such as Lightning
Riffs Waldner, even if some of his
personal habits are disgusting. i
would have liked to fill the entire
5&3 with our conversation, except
that after his third bottle of
Thunderbird, most of what was
understandable wasn’t even fit for
this paper. on wellwne must
suffer if one Wishes to sing the
blues . . . .

In the October 10 Issue of the
SErB, The New Time published an
open letter in which they said:
“...wc maintain a critical stance
towards the attitude that persons
can solve the social problems
facing us today ‘as best i can in my
own way.’ We see this individualist
position as arising from a par
ticular class outlook, i.e., that of
the privileged middle-class.” The
New Time is exactly right. This
criticism tics in with what. should
be a criticism of one at the greatest
wastes of society's time and
resources—the so-called backrtd
nature movement.

None of us really knew the
beginnings of the nature
movement; we were just a little too
young. th being out of its direct
inﬂuence, and looking back on it
now, we can maintain a sort of
critical objectivity. The people who
began the movement in the 1960‘s
rejected a way of life that they
believed was stiﬂing and unr
fulfilling. In other words, they
rejected the traditional life of the
middle class. Now before I go any
further we must recognize one

Back to nature

themselves were children of this
leisure class.

when l was in junior high and
high school, most of the freaks
lived in North Stamford, the
wealthier part of town. While they
were busy staring atthc clouds and
walking ill |he woods, the working
class kids from the West Side were
either beating them up or driving
expensive cars. of course, we can't
blame somebody for being born
rich; for this reason, the hippy-
liberal has no reason to blush at his
big house. (As i drove a girl home
from school to her exclusive neighr
borhood one day, she assured me
that those homes would be “the
first to go when the revolution
comes." We can blame somebody
though, for pretending to reject
attitudes that he never really does,

book back at the late 1970‘s. This
is what some people said: ”Our
modern industrial society had
become an unmanageable monr
ster. Technology has made our
jobsino, our whole livesi
impersonal and shallow. Not only
that, but all of us live for one
purpose only, and that is to make a
buck at the expense oi solncone
else. Let us break out of this cruel,
confining system and establish a
better way to live. Let us find a
way of life that will allow us to
develop ourselves to the fullest.”

So what did they do? They went
back to nature. Nature, it was
presumed. would relieve us of our
neuroses, would teach us to love
our brother, would feed our souls.
tWe see the rcstdue of this sens
timent in telvision ad»
vertisements.7 The natural life
could then be applied to all of
humanity, curing its ills. And so
communes were formed, geodesic
domes were erected in forests. and
great quantities of expensive
hiking gear were bought. Back

yards in the suburbs became
checked with cucumbers, green
peppers. tomatoes, squash, etc,
Girlswcnt barefoot in the middle of
winter. as If it was natural to want
your feet to freeze.

In the middle of all this, the
leisure class was scorned, “They
make huge amounts of money
through exploitative and
meaningless jobs," the hippies
Said. “While our reward is little,
we are happy with it, having
earned it honestly and
meaningfully." All this is pure
garbage. in one of those
housewives’ magazmes, Eddie
Alberttthe actol‘l said that
everyone in America should get
himself a piece at land and grow
things on it. This would not only
provide a fulfilling communion
with nature, but would also wipe
out our food shortage. What is
unfortunate about this idea is that
not everybody can oiiord to buy
land in this country. besides, our
food problem is not a problem of
supply, but a problem of
distributioniAmerica grows more
lhan enough food.

My main point is this: Not only
would lnoving out to a cabin in the
woods be impractical, but to claim
that itis a rejection of leisure-class
abuses is also ridiculous. Henry
David Thoreau could build his
shack for a pittance only because
of the cheap tools furnished to him
by mass production~by the
modern industrial society where,
he felt, people let their work bury
them, In other words, he could be
sure, while he was producing
enough beans to feed only himself,
that there was someone else
working in the blacksmith shop or
the textile mill who would supply
him and thousands of others with
cheap, dependable goods. If
ever one had nuit his on and built

a shack in the woods, they all
would have found lhemselves
without forged axes, without
anything,

This is the ultimate hypocrisy of
the nature-child: his is a leisure
activity, fie has the means to Get
lnto Nature only because he knows
thzlt there are other people who
can’t, And yet he claims that his is
a viable way to solve society’s
problems. The man who quits his
urban llfe and goes to live in the
mountains of Montana is more of a
leisure class-member than the
millionaire who buys a yacht. The
millionaire at least returns some
service in,say, the direction of his
corporation. the nature freak
returns nothing, The backaio»
nature mania is not only un-
productive, but, like a parasite, ii
feeds oif the world oi technology
and industry—all the while
claiming to reject its validity and
its ethics. To claim that living free
in nature is a valid substitute for
industrialism is absurd; to claim
that it is a rejection of leisure
values is a lie.

As I sit and write this, i find it
hard enough to propel myself into
the World and face its problems. I
don't. need some hippy-boy
bedeckcd ill flowers tempting me
to join his soybean commune in
California. We must admit that this
pursuit oi nature, despite its
benefits to the individual, is a
pursuit of leisure, Rather than
being au alternative to modern
industrialism, it is a product of
industrial society and depends on it
for survival, Those who return to
nature—who build a cabin ill the
woods, so to speak'arc not
presenting a valid model for the
rest of the world. Instead, they are
just transferring their pursuit of
leisure irom one activity to
another.
