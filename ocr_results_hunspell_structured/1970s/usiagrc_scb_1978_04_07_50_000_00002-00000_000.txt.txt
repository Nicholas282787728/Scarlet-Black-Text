Kiefer, Leff in runoff

by Marikay Kameczura

The SGA vicerpresidential
election will be held Monday, April
10, The two top votesgetteis in the
ﬁrst round election, Tom Kiefer
and Harvey Leif, are the can»
didates in Monday‘s runoil.

Each contestant hopes to
capitalize on student dis-
satisiaction with SGA’s per—
formance this year. They em-
phasize that SGA Should be more
responsive to student opinion,

Kiefer qualities his candidacy by
saying, “i think it’s time SGA
started to actively pursue its role

as a major mechanism of student
input at Grinnell. if I'm elected, I
can do a great deal toward that
end,”

Leif believes he has the
qualiﬁcations to be a good vice-
president. “I feel my views are
ﬂexible enough to be responsive to
the different opinions here," he
said. Both candidates plan to issue
platforms before the end oi the
week,

Before break, Greg Youtz was
elected as next year's SGA
president in the SGA presidential

runoff held Monday, March 13.
Youtz won by a slim 23 votes. Of
the 506 eligible votes cast, 259 or
51.2 per cent went to Youtz while
his opponent, Rhonda West,
received 236 votes or 46.6 per cent.
There were 11 writesin votes, ac-
counting tor 2.2 per cent of the
total.

Participation in the presidential
election was average, according to
SGA election chairman Kino Ruth,
but he anticipates a much lower
turnout for Monday's vice»
presidential race,

Ten and inmates in specific
prisons of this country. We should
encourage national commissions of
human rights Wlthln each country,
including our own.” he said.

Although there are signs that the
U N. has playeda constructive role
in uniting developing nations which
are concerned about human rights
and in alerting the world to an
increasing need for international
human rights policy, Mezvinsky
cautioned that “there is no cause
for us in be euphoric. The
movement is glacierlike."

“ENCOURAGING and ex-
panding this iorward movement
needs to be high on the agenda of
America’s diplomatic concerns. .
We must not forget that the
current efforts of our government
originated with the American
people and belongs With them. The
injection into our foreign policy oi
the moral standards we hold
closely as a people is an imporhant
step. The most powerful weapon
we have for combating violations
of human rights is the truth,” he
said.

Although he called current at-
tempts to integrate discussion of
the human rights issue into

 

American diplomacy
“frustrating" and “complex,"
Mezvinsky asserted that U S. et-
forts to do so “have struck a
responsive chord both here and
around the world.”

“OUR government is taking a
Stand that is in accord with our own
moral fiber and with the ideals of
our nation, In other countries,
people are heartened by our
initiatives. America's strong in-
terest in human rights is being
clmrly heard. Now when we
negotiate with other countries, the
human rights card is laid out on the
table in lull View, In the past it was
hardly visible," he said. _

Mczvinsky was in Grinnell this
week as a visiting lecturer under
the auspices of the political science
department. He visited classes and

participated in informal
discussions wtth students and
faculty members, as well as
delivering the policy address
during his stay here.
