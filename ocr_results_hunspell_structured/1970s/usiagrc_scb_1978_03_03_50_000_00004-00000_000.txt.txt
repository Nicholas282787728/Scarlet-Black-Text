Who’s laughing?

Poor Kino Ruth. He's the SGA Election Board chairman.
He's the poor soul who is responsible for running this year's
SGA elections. He's got to type up the ballot, count the
votes, oversee the entire election process.

It all wouldn’t be quite so bad if this year's election wasn't
so unique. The number of candidates running for SGA
president is slightly higher than usual, 113 to be exact. One
tenth of the student body. That’s almost more students than
normally vote in an SGA election. What a mess. Poor Kino.

NOW, WE can certainly appreciate the humor of the
situationsone hundred and thirteen names, what a laugh!
Imagine typing up the ballot. My God, envision counting the
votes. Poor Kino.

One only wonders why there were so few applicants for the
position of vice-president. One hundred thirteen candidates
for president, one for vice-president—all chiefs, no Indians—
we never knew Grinnell students were_so power hungry,

0R SO INTERESTED in the SGA. Well, we all know that
most of _the candidates aren't interested in student govern-
ment, they're interested in a practical joke. Or maybe it’s all
the same thingiat least that's what’s implied in this whole
affair.

It's easy to lampoon something as large, limp and pour
derous as the SGA. It's a natural. It’s like a face looking for
a cream pie And perhaps it’s good that we can all laugh at it.
Nothing should ever be taken all that seriously, anyway—
right? ‘

WELL, maybe. While there are plenty of people around
here who feel that the SGA does little more than heat up
ARI-I ll every Wednesday night with a lot of warm, moist
air, others feel it serves a useful purpose on campus. And, it
seems to us, they have as much right to their view as the
anti-SGA folks have to theirs. Who's to say?

Which brings us back to the election. Out of the glorious
113, there are actually only three or four who are running
seriously, who really want to be SGA president next year.
The rest couldn’t care less.

ONE HUNDRED and thirteen people is a lot of can-
didates. no doubt about it. And it's a humorous situation, to
be sure, but it should stop here. We feel the jokes already
been made Why beat it to death? A vote for a non-serious
candidate on Wednesday will accomplish nothing that hasn't
been accomplished already, and only serve to make poor
Kino [whom we've told you is already miserable) even more
miserable.

We hate to trot out that old, time~worn adage, but it's
true: you get the kind of government you vote for, If you
vote for a joke this Wednesday, in all probability that's what
you will have to represent you next year~an
stitutionalized joke.

ON THE other hand, if you are tmly interested in doing
away with SGA, there are other ways of going about it.
There is apparently plenty of dissatisfaction on campus with
SGA. Indeed, this latest bit of foolishness is a manifestation
of the students’ dissatisfaction. If students feel that a
fundamental change in the SGA is necessary, we urge them
to challenge SGA in a more thoughtful, responsible manner.
This is really just a joke.

And like we said, theioke‘s already been made.

'Bakke case just an illusion

The Bakke case is nothing more
than an illusion designed to
distract minorities from the
problems at hand. Anyone who has
looLed at the facts knows that
Bakke's case shouldn’t have made
it to the Supreme Court

The facts are: Bakke was denied
admission to several medical
schools more than once; Whites
with lower scores than Bakke were
accepted to the California medical
school and minorities with higher
scores than Bakke were accepted.
In view of these facts, how
Could Bakke claim reverse
discrimination?

IIOW could his case move all the
way up to this country's highest
court? There are forces in this
country that want minorities and
the rest of the world to think that.
America’s desire for equality
amongst its citizens is so great that
it may have passed a program
(affirmative action) that gives too
much of an advantage to a segment
of its population “.6. minorities)

The reality of affirmative action
is that it is nothing more than a
token gesture to keep peoples of
color quiet. Affirmative action is
only effective in opening the doors
of opportunity to a very small
percentage of minorities. Of course
women are affected by affirmative
action, but the problems Women
face, especially white women, are
not exactly the same as minorities.

IN ANY event, the Bakke case
focuses its attack on minorities.
The minorities that benefit from
affirmative action are the ones
that somehow manage to get the
skills necessary for them to be
acceptable to industries and in-
stitutions of higher education. The
vast majority of peoples of color
are still experiencing improper
education, poverty and all of the
other forms of oppression.

Unfortunately, the Bakke case is
causing many people to believe
that affirmative action is
significantly changing the con-
dition of minorities. If Bakke loses,
almost everyone will say it is a
great victory for human rights.
Because it will be such a “great
victory.” the white power Struc-
ture will be disinclined to pass any
other “large" pieces of legislation
for minority people in the near
future. The Uncle Toms will go into
.the ghetioes preaching that the end '
of minorities suffering in this
country is fast approaching and all 1

they have to do is wait passively a
little while longer

if“ Bakke loses. passivity is the
worst course minority people could
follow. Organized massive revolt is
the only thing that should follow
the Bakke case whether he wins or
loses. Peoples of color must follow

System works

To the editor: In four years of life
at Grinnell College, I have heard
the cry for student input take a
variety of forms. On many oc-
casions, I have lent my voice to the
cry, for I too believe that student
input is a valid and necessary
factor in the decision making
process of this college. Much time
and effort, on the part of both
administrators and students. have
been committed to the attainment
of effective student input. The end
has by no means been reached,
but. substantial progress has been
made. This is a fact that the
Gadfly—lhe editorial publication
of 05A7not only ignores but
denigrates.

The first issue of the Gadfly
openly disavowed any “claim to be
an objective news reporter." The
substance of the Gatlfly certainly
substantiated the truth of this
disclaimer. I do not challenge the
right of the Gadfly to exist, or to
publish editorials with a decidedly
“liberalrleftist” orientation. In
fact, I join the staff in its goal of
gaining more extensive and more
“real” student input.

HOWEVER , I do challenge the
truth of many of the assertions and
the validity of many of the con
clusions drawn by the Gadfly. I
suggest that the staff reexamine
some of its basic assumptions and
demands. if they really are in-
teresled in furthering student
imput. If they do not, they may find
that rather than “stinging the
system into action," they will be
poisoning the system with un-
necessary venom.

A good deal of the szﬂy's
vituperation is directed towards
the “system." It seems that the
system in and of itself .is at fault,
for it is condemned without any
evidence being shown as to where
it has failed.

the philosophy of Michael Korda,
author of Power, who said that real
power cannot be given—ii must be
taken. In the case of minorities,
power means simple, basic
equality and it must be attained as
Malcolm X put it . . by any
means necessary.”

; Gadfly unfair

students are indeed being involved
in the major decisions and that
there has been student input and
approval of policy issues such as
the boycott proposal.

THE boycott proposal is a good
example of how students pal'r
licipale in a policy issue. The
proposal originated in the
Facilities and Food Services Sub
Committee. After debate and due
consideration, this proposal passed .
on to the Committee on Student
Life iCSL). The CSL announced
through the Campus Memo that the
matter would be discussed and that
its meeting would be open to
student discussion. After con- 0
sideration by the CSL. the proposal
went to SGA.

With these three levels of student
input, 1 find it difficult to accept
.Iirn Stuart‘s condemnation that
the “CSL is trying to cram a
reactionary policy down the
students' throats.” Many of the
assertions in the ‘boycoti.’ article of
the Gadfly were similarly
exaggerated. andpr were direct.
misrepresentations of what the
proposal included. I urge every
interested student to obtain a copy
of the proposal from their SGA
representative and draw their own
conclusions, rather than be in— O
fluenced either by Jim’s biases or
my own.

I SUGGEST that S‘,udent input is
alive and well at Grinnell. lt will
continue to survive and hopefully
advance as long as there are those
willing to Work for it. Condemning
students such as Gary Doemhoefer
(who has done an incalculable
service to the students of Grinnell
as one of the members of the .
”Active Student Club") and those
who voice student opinion on the
various committees is not an in»
telligent or profitable way to ad-
vance the cause of student input.

 

Speaking from an extensive
background of committee in
volvement,. I. can. testify. .mat

Try the system, believe it or not, it 0
