Moving delayed

The proposed movement of the Career Services Office and
the Offices of Student Affairs and Academic Advising into the
house just south of Nollen House have been delayed due to the
installation of new Windows on South Campus. Jim Teder»
man. dean of student affairs, explained that because B&G
workers were installing the windows in Cleveland, James,
and Haines Halls over the summer, they were unable to start
remodeling work.

Work started this week and will be continued throughout
the semester. Tederman said that he hoped that the diffcrent
offices would be able to move during Christmas break. It is
hoped that the move will enable each office to better aid
students as well as allow them to easily combine their
counseling services

Pub fees increased

More live entertainment, a new
sound system, and repaired air
conditioning are among the exe
penses which the Pub Club hopes to
at least partially cover with the one
dollar increase in the membership
iee this year,

According to Paul Gertman, new
manager for the Pub, the $3.00
membership will hopefully “allow

Sex counseling
program continued

By Debbie Weiner

Sexuality counseling which
proved successiul last year is back
again. Eight counselors are on
hand to talk to students about
problems ranging from birth
control to homosexuality;~ several
others are currently in training to
become counselors. The counseling
office is in Smith Annex, and is
open Monday-Thursday, 8-10 pm,
and Saturday and Sunday. 274 p.m.
Posters with the phone numbers of
the counselors have been placed
around the campus,

Identity
found

After much debate and
discarding such options as Oral
History House and Local Studies
House, members of a new coop-
project at 1205 Park Street have
named their residence simply
“Townhouse". -

The twelve-member group grew
out of a common interest in imp
proving the relationship between
the town and college communities
in Grinnell.

Throughout the year.
Townhousers hope to establish
rapport between the two groups in
various ways. One of the more
appetizing is that of open dinners
at the house involving members of
the house, students, college stall,
faculty administration and town
residents. Other ideas include
multi-media displays put together
by Townhousers. Other members
hope to volunteer their services in
one oi the many community
projects like the Grinnell Day Care
Center. Several house residents
are enrolled in house adviser
Douglas Caldkins' Ethnographic
Research course and will be in-
volved in fieldwork projects
around Grinnell,

This year’s program is ex-
panding into educational areas.
Counselors will give presentations
in the dorms throughout the year.
A health-care course will be taught
in conjunction with the Women's
Group, and films sponsored by the
Women's Group and the Grinnell
College Gay Community have been
scheduled.

The Gynecological Service is
also in operation. Every Tuesday
afternoon at 12:30. transportation
is provided [or women to go into
Des Moines to see a gynecologist.
Women wishing to do this can first
contact one of the sexuality
counselors,

Sexuality counseling needs were ,

demonstrated last year when Over
100 students sought advice from
the counselors. Birth control and
heterosexual relationships were
the topics most discussed. Another
training program will probably be
conducted next Spring for those
interested in becoming Counselors.

Gertman, who was named
manager by the Board Of Directors
last spring. spent two months in
training ior his position last year
He was graduated from Grinnell in
December with a degree in art.
Pub management is now a full
time, so hour per week job for him. ,
Gertman said the Board decided tor
find a full time manager rather
than a student manager hecuase
they realized the Pub was a full
time affair.

Because the Pub is a private,
nonprofit club that must sell
membership, and cannot legally
serve non-members, Gertman said
that students will be checked for
memberships more often this year.
