out, 0-5, by Iowa Wesleyan. The
team's record is now 0-2, while
Wesleyan is presently H).

The game was dominated by the
Wesleyan team. as the Pioneers
found themselves on defense [or
most oi the game. lowa Wesleyan
took the lead early, scoring twice
in the ﬁrst period, in the second,
they scored three more times, but
then they were held scorless in the
final period. Grinnell experienced
a general lack oi organization that
could not be overcome until it
was too late.

Two oi the goals were
questionable. according to Coach
Sandy Hoth. The tourth goal found
Wesleyan obstructing the defen-
scwomen, who were thus unable to
be in position to defend The final
goal came as Grit nell fullback
Deb Swackhamer, was momen-
tarily disabled atter being hit in the
chin with the ball. The game was
not delayed and theWcsleyan team
drove past a still Grinnell team

Title IX, NCAA c/as

by Dave Schechter

Title IX, the new Federal
guidelines equalizing opportunities
tor women Within academia, is the
most important education measure
since Brown vs, Topeka. Covering
admissions, ﬁnancial aid,
vocational and academic .coun-
seling, and athletics the measure
has drawn considerable criticism,
Women’s groups have called it
ineffective while the NCAA
(National Collegiate Athletic
Association) has stated that the
regulations “threaten college
athletics."

Despite the fact that there are
portions of Title IX still in need of
examination the measure is along
overdue step towards equalizing
the quality of men's and women's
athletic programs. What is
threatened by the H,E.W. measure
is the despotic power at the NCAA
and its president, Walter Byers,
over college athletics From their
perspective the participation angle
of athletics long ago gave way to
the principles oi big business. An
NCAA publication, on March 1,
1974, stated, “it these regulations
are ultimately given the iorce oi
law, the administration of the
athletic program oi virtually every
NCAA member will be
dramatically aiiected . . . These
eiiects will be ireouently
disruptive, otten destructive and
surely counter-productive to the
Very objectives which Title IX
seeks to attain.”

What is it that Title IX seeks?
Simply to equalize the conditions
‘under which women’s athletic
,irograms have been conducted in

the past. These measures twhich
colleges have one year and
elementary schools three years to
implement) will desegregate by
sex nonrcontact physical education
courses. In a contact sport,
separate male and {male teams
must be provided if sufficient
iemale interest is expressed.
Separate teams may not iavor one
sex in terms oiiaeilities,bud'ge't, or
coaching quality, and athletic
scholarships given to men must be
proportionally matched. based on
participation, to women.

The NCAA fears that money
made in football programs, much
of it through lucrative television
contracts, will now have to be

l/lEl/I/ ROM’
iHE SlDELIN ES

channelled into women's programs
rather than back into football. and
that male sports will not receive
their customary first cut. of the pie.
The New York Times attributes
this feeling to a ”distortion of
values in the commercialized
world of college sports ."
Womensports magazine points out
that large institutions could save
themselves money, which could be
channelled into women’s programs
by cutting separate athletic dorms
and some oi the unnecessary travel
expenses that are incurred.

What the women fear is that by
increasing expenditures, women's
sports wrll go the athletecxploiting
route of men's programs.

However, the women should be
given the chance to make their
programs work. Granted that
some schools will have to change
the way that their athletic
departments handle money.
Granted that in some instances
some existing male programs may
suiier. Still. by iar the majority oi
the changes will be positive 0
putting men’s and womc .
programs on equal footing. The
Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (of Wh
Grinnell's Sandy Hoth is the to '
Fresident) has worked long and
hard to upgrade the quality oi
women’s programs, Recently,
the NCAA has taken an interest in
women's programs. From this
angle it appears as though Walter
Byers wishes to put women's
programs under his wing in order
to circumvent some of Title IX.

What is needed is de-
emphasizatiun of the big business
role in college athletics There is no
reason why collegiate wo
athletes Should not receive
same quality at program as their
male counterparts, Title IX
regulations will go a long way
towards upgrading the quality oi
women’s sports. The NCAA x
make itseli more representative 0
all althetic programs, not just the
big iiity with the prestige. As Tl
New York Times said, "The a -
swer to such tears is that the time
has come, not tor counting the
women in, but tor getting the
campuses out at their cow
mereialism thinly disguised as
college sports.”
