Harris organization to
confront problems

by Henry Cornell

At Grinnell College a broad
based organization of townspeople,
iaculty and students is in the
process oi being iormed. The
principle object of this

r,anization is to get people
thinking about the issues and
problems confronting the nation in
1976, and how the leadership of
i d Harris in the White House can
turn this country around in such a
Way as to rekindle the idealism and
activism which is necessary to our
national complacency and sur~
Qal.

The main argument of Fred
Harris' campaign for presidency is
not original: some i titutions and
people have too much money and
power, the majority of Americans
have toolittle, and the lirst priority
of a Harris administration would
be to redress that imbalance
Harris’ notion of “economic
democracy as a prerequisite to

political democracy" is the
principle which guides his policy,

In order to transform this
principle into reality Harris calls
for the national redistribution of
wealth This would be ac-
complished through a sharply
graduated income tax with equal
taxation regardless of the source of
income, break-up oi monopolistic
industries, the elimination oi tax
loopholes, the commitment oi
government to a inll employment
economy, and other policies along
this line

The heart of Harris‘ “New
Populism” is that the Wealth and
power in this country benefits few
while the common loss is obvious.
This power, which is basically
economic, corrupts the political
process and insulates government
from effective challenge and
reform. This “New Populism,"
stripped oi the racism and
paranoia which crippled it in the

past, can ameliorate the im-
balance which has afflicted
America for so long. It is a political
goal, not a cultural prescription or
revolutionary nostrum. Only Fred
Harris, who is not a slick
Democratic candidate, but an
honest “Okie” who fought ior such
changes while in the Senate, can
institute the reform this country
desperately needs,

There will be an organizational
meeting Tuesday, November 25 at
7:00 in ARH ii. Everyone is
strongly encouraged to attend with
ideas, criticism and anything else
that might be relevant. ii there are

by Elaine Ashbaugh

Under the auspices oi the
Grinnell Art Department,
Professor Glenn Andres, assistant
professor oi art at Middlebury
College, presented a slide lecture
entitled Nanni di Baccio Bigio: A
Look at the Thorn in
Michelangelo‘s Side, The 8:00 p rn

presentation, given in the South-

Lounge of the Forum, touched
Dorm the subject oi Andrcs‘ soon-
' erpuhlished two volume work
" l titled The Villa Medici ill Rome.
Grinnell College President A.
ichard Turncr, art historian and
Srevious Dean of the Faculty at
"dlebury College, introduced
roiessor Andres as his colleague
“(or several happy years." Andres
then proceeded, giving his
audience a general idea of mid
sixteenth century Rome and the
1500720 “assertion of grandeur
under Popes Julius II and Leo X"
which ultimately led to the Rome
oi Michelangelo's dayeand oi his
contemporary, Nannl di Baccio
Bigio.
dres, proceeding with his
ure, presented di Baccio Bigio,
born between 1511 and 1512, as an

aggressive man at little scruple who

lit to great length to compete
th Michelangelo, especially in
t building of Rome’s Basilica of
St, Peter, According to Andres, by
mid-century, Michelangelo ape
eared as a ”justly dominant
'ggure whose conceptions dotted
Rome,” This, Nanni, a prominant
member of the anti-Michelangelo
iorces worked against Rome's
most important architectural
iigure.
Although only brielly and
negatively mentioned by Giorgio
Hsari, friend of Michelangelo and
. e ﬁrst art historian, Nanni di
Baccio Bigio did execute an
astonishing number oi works,
according to Andres. However,
attributions for his works have
tditionally been given to Nanni’s
teacher, to one of his sons, or to
Michelangelo, among others.
Andres, prominent in the at-
tribution to Nanni of his rightful
architectural executions, praised
Nanni’s work in pointing out his
innovative ocular niches and
iindows, a courtyard described as
“absolutely charming," andtin
speaking of him as “a real master

at transiorming the works of
previous architects."

Proiessor Andres ended his slide
lecture by emphasizing Vasari’s
role in the possibly unjust black
balling oi Nanni dl Baccio Bigio
Although Vasarl “did a beautiiul
job" oi accomplishing his goal oi
sending Nanni into historical
oblivion, Andres pointed out that

Nanni was an extremely important
architect oi his time, executing
numerous papal commissions and
iinally becoming papal architect
for life. The works of Nannl di
Baccio Bigio, in Andres‘ opinion,
do merit study and must be cons
ceived in light oi the important
iniluence they had on subsequent
architecture,

Christo is internationally known
for his work in the area of wranv

the age of 22, with the “nouveaux
realites” group in Paris.

Christo’s other projects and
his more modest Oceanfront
Project at Newport, were cons
ceived, organized, executed, and

wraps

then dismantled. Each stage of the
project was documented, and the
photographer was an integral part
of the creative team

Christo’s Oceanfront Project
utilized 150,000 square feet of
polypropylene iabric lloating on
the sea and attached to the shore
by 42 anchors, It was executed on
Aug. 19, 1974, and after eight days
the piece was dismantled and the
beach was returned to its natural
state.

The Oceanfront Project
exhibiton is composed oi such
documents as maps and letters,
