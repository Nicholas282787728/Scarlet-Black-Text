5 Sense of value
on Strata-Earth

by Dan Hexter

Dear iriends. nope you've heard

a lot in my twoweek long absence.
\this week i heard a relatively new
album by Keno Duke entitled
“Sense of Values." Keno is a
ither exceptional drummer with
ots in straight ahead jazz. This
contrasts with many drummers of
today who back up all ol the
electric modern jazz which seems
i" he taking over the air and the
recording studios. with him on this
album is George Coleman oi Miles
Davis fame (he preceded Wayne
Shorter). Harold lvlabern on
acoustic piano, Lisle Atkinson on
string bass, and Frank Strozicr on
alto and ilute,

All the cuts have solid melodies,
with exceptional solos. The
musicians are all spiritually

‘ogether, and came together
physically through the
organizational eiiorts of the
Collective Black Artists in New
York, CBA now owns and operates

yatabast recording studios, in
he hopes oi carrying on the strong
traditional jazz which all too often
becomes background in the
American stream of com»

rcialized music, But. check it'

out—these artists are here to stay
along with the art iorm they
adhere to. il'you get into America‘s
only true original art form tto coin
an old but very true phrase) you’ll
like this album.

AS long as we’re into CBA and
the black “pioneers” who par»
ticipate in the music oi America, l
reel obliged to turn you on to “Billy

Parker‘s Fourth World-Freedom
oi Speech" ieaturing Dee Dee
Bridgewater, Cecil and Ron
Bridgewater, Cecil McBee, and
Donald Smith. With Dee Dee’s
exceptional lung capacity, and
Don's smooth souding tenor voice,
the blend is a high that you cannot

repertoire consists oi fast moving
cuts and excited vocals which test

Most important is that these
artists are also Working through
the CBA unit in New York City and

Or as Billy Parker writes on the
cover notes: “The music is
dedicated to iamily and iriends as
well as to the memory oi Charles
Parker, Billie Holiday. and John
Coltrane without whose con~

'Secret meetings? Will, you appall me

To the Editor:

The SGA “Laughin” programi
Sunday evenings on KDICA
generally lives up to its name. Last
Sunday, however, it was not iun-
ny~only shocking and disaps
pointing.

Mr. Collins, ior those who missed
it, was discussing the October 7
Skip Day, Speciiically he was
bemoaning the fact that the library
remained open that day. He vowed
that “next time” (presumably next
skip day) he’d have it closed. it
necessary by “secret meeting."

Well, Will, you appall me. will
you compel me to sit in the sun, go
barefoot, and drink free beer? Will
you make me enjoy myself? Will

BEiG need‘s
relaxation,too

To the Editor: .

Have we iorgotten the Bite
workers?

In President Turner's ans
nouncement oi Skip Day, he called
it a day ior the whole community to
have “ . . . a breather, relax, and
enjoy the day , " But the Boo
workers are one segment of the
college community (along with
Forum and bookstore workers and
others) who were not free to
partake oi the Skip Day iestivities.
While the whole campus was
relaxing tor at least had the op-
portunity to do so!) their work
went on aS usual.

I propose that Skip Day be ex-
tended to be enjoyed by more
members oi the campus coma

See degradation of women

Dear Editor:

For some weeks we have been
subjected to your insulting and
degrading columns and editorial
on the subject oi Grinnell women,
Taking the advice oi your last
Week's column, we have decided to
“move on a feeling now” and
contest some oi the stereotypes you
are trying to ioist on your readers.

Last week‘s editorial accuses
women oi “abnegating their power
by not iilling important student
positions," implying that iemale
participation in the college com-
munity is solely measured by the
number at women in SGA and lts
various committees. Many
Grinnell women have consciously
Chosen to direct their lime and
energies into alternative iorms oi
political action. Women are very
active in The New Time. the
Democratic Socialists, the Third
World Group, CBS, and the
Coalition. This year both the
Women’s Group and the Lesbian
Union have been zealously
purusing many political, personal.
and social goals, Your casual
treatment or some oi our major
accomplishments depreciates
them and implies that they are not
as valuable as an increase in
iemale hall representatives would
be.

The women at Grinnell are an
incredibly diverse group with a iar
broader range oi interests and
lifestyles than one would ever
suspect (rum reading your paper
Thus, the mere concept of a
“lypical Grinnell iemale" as put
forth in “Power to No One" is
absurd. Whatever the “liberating”
intention of this column, its obs
session with malecl'emale
stereotypes serves to perpetrate
these very stereotypes. God iorbid
that the author’s PERCEPTIONS
of “Grinnell dictums” would ever
be remotely identified with
feminism

Last week's column continues
the pattern oi sweeping
generalizations concerning women
based on “asking a few friends
about their major interests,” First
the author asserts that ”few
women” are Concerned with
various political issues. Then she
burdens the reader with her
narrow perceptions oi Grinnell
relationships. The author's views
on friends‘andlovers iollow many
traditional stereotypes and she

oiiers no suggestion lor coping
With the difficulties of relation
ships beyond adopting the attitude
of schoolwork first. A more useful
goal ior iuture columns than
“confining (them) to more
tangible, political subjects" might
be an attempt to relate such topics
to our daily relationships. The task
of reconciling our political
ieminism and the practice oi such
beliefs in our personal lives is one
which all women should work
together to lull'ill.

Possibly you regard the women’s
lssue which is scheduled tor after
break as a means oi broadening
and diversiiying your tocus on
women's roles and concerns.
However, one can not alienate a
readership on a regular basis and
then expect one special issue to
comDensate ior inadequacies and
inaccuracies oi your journalisms

Editor's Note: Opinion columns do

of the 5515 editorial statf
Columnists are free to express any
ieelings they wish to. and are not
guided by the editors in any way.
Uniortunately, last week's
editorial touched on a subject
regularly handled by a columnist,
This was purely coincidental.

it was wrong to allow the author
oi Zanda, Kathy Kramer, to
publish her column anonymously.
From this point on. the Zanda
column will be clearly labeled as
expressing the opinion oi Kramer
alone

Anyone in the Grinch Com-
munity who expresses interest can
