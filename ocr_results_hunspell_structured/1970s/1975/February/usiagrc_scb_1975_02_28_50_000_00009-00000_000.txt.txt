The Bermuda Triangle:
Voyages Into limbo

On December 5, 1945, a group at live U.s.
Navy bombers took oti from Fort Lauderdole,
Florida, An hour and half later the {light was
overdue ior return. When radio contact was
tinally made with the night commander
Charles Taylur, his only words were, “We
seem to be lost, everything is strange-even
the ocean.” Minutes later a standard Search
and rescue mission was launched carrying
thirteen seasoned airmen. Making Contact
with Taylor’s mission the last and only
transmission heard was, “Don’t come alter
me, they look like they are from outer space,
don't come alter me." Seven minutes later
radio contact was lost with the rescue plane.
in spite oi one of history's most intensive
searches, no trace ol either aircralt was ever
found.
