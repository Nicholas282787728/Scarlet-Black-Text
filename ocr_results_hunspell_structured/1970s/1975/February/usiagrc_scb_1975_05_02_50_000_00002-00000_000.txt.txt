Paint policy finalized

Early this week, the Residence
Hall Improvement Committee
ﬁnalized a paint policy for 19757
1976. It includes guidelines for
painting both student rooms and
public areas (lounges, hallways,
kitchens). The committee will
present the policy to Joint Boards
sometime next week.

The new policy speciiies that
painting can be done once every
three years. "More frequent
painting," it explains, “would
cause excessive paint buildup and
eventual surface failure as well as
expense." Walls must be painted in
solid color under the new policy.
Two colors may be used only when
one wall is a shade of white or
beige. Accent colors may be ap
plied to the trim, woodwork and
transoms. Colors must have at
least a 75 percent reﬂectance level,
for energy reasons. Even with this
restriction, students will have 167
colors from which to choose.

Due to lack of student time, lost
of misplaced equipment, and poor
workmanship, Physical Plant
personnel will do the painting
under the new policy. Students will
be welcome to assist them during
their working hour578:00 to 5:00
Monday through Friday.

Under the new policy, in

bio (l L. [vi ,i stoic to, non tow

dividuals wishing to paint their
rooms will be required to fill out an
application at the Office of Student
Affairs. After the student chooses a
color, the time oi the room painting
will be set according to a master
painting schedule which will be
available in the Office of Student
Affairs. Procedures for public area
painting are essentially the same.
After hall officers have filled out
applications, the Wise oi Student
Affairs Will establish Contact
between hall officers and a
member of the Dorm Rennovation
Committee. This person will meet
with members of the dorm and
help out with the project,

Next week the committee will
choose a color for the Cowles
dining area. Physical Plant
workers will paint the dining hall
over the summer,

Members of the committee were
generally pleased with the ﬁnal
policy. Harold Horn, Manager oi
Housekeeping Servwes expressed
his satisfaction with the policy.
“There are certain limitations
imposed by the fact that there has
to be a policy at all,” commented
Mike Gelbort, ”but within the
limitations I mink we ended up
with a pretty good overall policy."

Deans
view
pressure

An open iorum on academic
pressure was held on the evening of
April 29 by Deans of the college
Waldo Walker and Jim Tederman.
Six students and six admistraﬁioni
faculty, and staff members at:
tended the meeting which was
theoretically designed to allow
students to respond to the results of
the academic pressure study
conducted by Dean Walker,

The present grading system was
one topic oi discussion. Dean
Walker felt that the grading
system should be “spread out a
little,” Agreeing with Dean
Walker, SGA President Will Collins
stated that there should be “more
room to pass a course.” When
asked what type oi grading system
was being considered for the
iuture, Walker answered that a
general reconsideration oi the
present system will begin next fall.

Development oi writing skills
was another subject considered by
the group. Dean Walker stated that
financial support oi the writing lab
will be increased next year.
President A, Richard Turner
suggested instructors have
students rewrite papers by writing
later on the same general problem.
The students present commented
that they had never done rewriting
in that way. Turner felt that this
type of rewriting would aiiord
”more respect for the craft.”

Gregory Guroff, associate
professor of history, asked Collins
if “too much freedom” could be a
iactor in academic pressure,
Collins re lied that “too much
responsibility” was related to
academic pressure. In Collins'
opinion there is not enough “ex-
ternal motivation” on campus.
Picking up on this point, Turner
commented that there seems to be
little ”sharing among students” as
far as the academics is concerned.
Competition among students was
cited as one cause of this lack of
interaction,

One Student said that in-
iormation about course reading
lists and course papers should be
available prior to registration. A
staff member replied that in the
past so per cent of the syllabi have
been accessible in the library.

In regard to the amount of course
Work, Collins stated that the
problem was not the quantity of
work as much as “how we ap—
proach and are taught to approach
work.” ,
