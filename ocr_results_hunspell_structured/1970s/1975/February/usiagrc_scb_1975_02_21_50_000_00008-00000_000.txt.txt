went on a three game tear, scoring
68 points and moving into the
conference scoring lead, but Coach
Ron Mitchell’s basketballers
dropped two of the three and fell to
4-9 in conference play. Still, the
cagers are assured of their best
record since the 7»ll showing made
by the 1969-70 club.

The losses were at the hands of
contender Lake Forest, 70-60, and
first place Knox, 7964. The lone
victory came Saturday afternoon
at Lawrence, 5545. All three were
road tilts.

Action tough on matmen

by Rick Nightingale

The Grinneil Pioneers lost a pair
of dual meets over the weekend to
Simpson 3348 and to Central 48-6.

AgainstSimpson. Hosea Engram
pinned his opponent in less than
three minutes at 167 lbs. Bob,
Donelan pinned his man in 1:34 at
177 lbs. Rick Nightingale won by
forfeit at 113 for Grinnell’s other
points. Mark Genereux also
wrestled well, losing a close
decision, 7-5, at 150 lbs.

At Central, Grinnell won two
weight classes by decision.
Genereux defeated his opponent at
150 lbs. by a score of 6-0 and
Engram won at 167 by a score of 5-
O. The Pioneers forfeited 142, 190,
and heavyweight, and were
without the services of B0 deRosa,
temporarily out with a knee injury.

on Tuesday, Feb. in, the
Pioneers hosted Central in a return
match. Grinnell lost this time 33-15,
showing a much improved per-

formance on the mat. The meet
was costly however, as Donelan
sustained a rib injury and may be
lost for the remainder of the
season.

Freshman Scott Beers, wrestling
at 134. picked up his first college
wrestling victory with an 11-5

decision. Dan Mosby at 167, with a _

sensational “flying duckunder,"
pinned his man.

Engram was moved up to 190,
and responded with his third win in
a row, again pinning his opponent.
Mike Darragh lost a close 74
decision at 158, and Nightingale
lost a match which he definitely
should have won, H.

Women Wrestling?

The Pioneer matmen take on
Carlton and Knox tomorrow at 1:30
in the PE. Complex. Grinnell has
an excellent chance to pick up two
more wins, but it should be a tough
challenge without deRosa and
Donelan.

 

C/R ascends Coed throne

by Rich Arnold

As spring approaches, so does
the end of intramural basketball.
The season has been a long one,
and tough on the upperclassmen
who participated; age and years of
body polluting are taking their toll.

A champion was crowned in the
Coed League Monday night. First
place finisher Cowles-Rawson
breezed through the playoffs and
won the coveted Latimer Cup. Fine
job, C-R! Playoffs commenced in
the Men’s League Wednesday with
the semifinals slated for a Feb. 24
date and the final match set for
play on Feb. 26.

When laSt we left the Coed
League we were in the semifinals.
Cowles-Rawson was paired against
the Shrimpshots and the Haines
Pitters wre pitted against the pithy
Green Knights. The Shrimpshots
got Cold tails at the last moment
and forfeited to Cowles-Rawson,
thrusting the dining room dishes
into the finals. In the other semi-
final game, the Green Knights
galloped past the Haines Pitters 43A
36. Sir David Guittar led all scorers
with 24 points.

Cowles-Rawson easily handled

Jagger's . . .

A week from today a jog-jag
meet with a twist will be run at the
indoor track meet oi that evening.
Contestants, and all are invited
warmly to participate, will be
asked to predict their finishing
time before starting. Upon
finishing they will be asked to pay
the women‘s track team five cents
for each second their prediction
erred by. All donations will go
towards uniforms and Trshirts for
the under-funded squad.

the Green Knights in the battle for
the championship as three C-R
stars were in double figures. OR
was in control the entire game and
ended up with an easy 48-33 vic-
tory. One of me johns in the men's
locker room 15 currently out of
order but as soon as it is repaired
the Latimer Cup wil‘ be removed
and presented to the Coed League
champs.

Finishing up the regular season
scores in the Men’s League, lowly
Smith gave Clark-Gates a scare as
the spunky Smith stars lost a
squaker to first place Clark-Gates
36-32. Smith missed the tying
basket with less than thirty
seconds to go, enabling 06 to
escape, scarred but alive.

Main-Mears numbed Off
Campus 49-44 as they put three
scorers in double figures. Greg
Fallon Continued his hot shooting
for DC as he totaled 26 points, all in
vain, alas. Dazzling Dave Van-
derpool fell two points short of this
year’s single-game individual
scoring record as Younkers
clubbed Smith 63-38. Vandcrpooi
led his team with 39 biggies.

With all regular season games
completed, the Profs wound up on
top in the South Division with a
perfect 12-0 mark, and Clark-Gates
and Younkers tied for the North
Campus crown, sporting identical
9%! records.

Pairings in the first round of the
playoffs are: Profs vs. Norris,
Younkers vs. Langan (these teams
make up one bracket), Clark-Gates
vs. Off Campus, and MainrMears
vs. Smith (these teams make up
the other bracket). The Profs and
ClarkrGates are favored to meet in
the championship game and this
reporter feels that Clark-Gates will
emerge on top. Stay, tuned for all
the exciting results. -

For those who are active in
women's lib, this is the match to
watch. Carlton's 118 lb. wrestler is
a girl (sorry Hope, but Mo says 1
have to). The Pioneers will wrestle
their last home meet on Tuesday,
Feb. 25, against Simpson; and will
conclude their season with the
Midwest Conference Tournament
at Monmouth on Feb. 23 and March

subsequent turnovers hurt the
Grinnellians, the favored
Foresters had to struggle down to
the wire against the firedrup
Pioneers.

Similarly, at Knox on Tuesday,
Grinnell was denied an upset
victory ir the verylate stages. Tied
34734 at halftime, Mitchell’s squad
ran to a 48421ead midway through
the final stanza. At this point,
according to Mitchell, the wild
enthusiasm of the Knox fans and a
“lack of sustenance” on the part of
the Pioneers turned the tide back
toward the Siwashers. Knox
proceeded to whip off ten unan-
swered points and never lost the
momentum after that. ,

“i attribute the Victory to their
fans,” commented Mitchell after
the game. Pleased, however, with
the overall performance of his
team, he observed that “we’ve

‘gained a lot of confidence and

poise. Our opponents have been
very complimentary about
basketball this year at Grinnell.”
Bailey,Haigh at the summit

Fine individual performances
from Bailey, John Haigh, Rick
Williams, and Gunnar Thors
highlighted the long basketball
weekend, The sensational scoring
of the highrscoring duo of Bailey
and Haigh, combined with Grin-
nell’s successful throttling of
former loop scoring leader Dave
Woodward of Knox, lifted them to
the top two positions in the cone
ference.

Munoz leads
women past UNI

by DaveSchecbter

Barring an upset at Knox this
Tuesday, the women’s swim team
will finish their season with an
undefeated dual mark of so and a
big win in the Miracle Relays. Last
week the women won two dual
(meets, over Knox and the
‘University of Northern lowa.

The women had an easier time of
Knox than the men did, winning

leasily 210-315. in their final home
I appearance of the year, the women

won nine of fourteen events.
Bonnie Kenney had a big day,
capturing the zoo freestyle, and the
100 butterfly, in addition to
swimming on the winning 200 yard
freestyle relay.

Records lall

UNI proved to be a tougher
proposition. The meet was held in a
30-yard pool (most pools are 25
yards.) with no lane markers and
shallow water. Still, Sheryl Hun-
toon set a pool record in winning
the 120 freestyle. Later she teamed
up with Becki Chipman, Marg
Horstman, and Kenney to set a
pool mark in the 200 free relay.

Virginia Munoz continued her
winning ways, taking the so but
terfly, 120 fly, and the 120 in-
dividual medley.

Mike Daley, die happily un-
defeated coach, commented that,
“The difference at UNI was
winning the two relays (the zoo
medley and 200 freestyle relays),
giving us a 1+0 advantage."

The meet against Knox was the
final home performance for
seniors Bonnie Kenney, Marg
Horstman, and Jill Hoover. Gail
Machala, who along with Hoover
served as captain this year told the
S Kc B that the team wished to thank
all of the people who helped with
the meets this season for helping to
make this season so successful

Men tripped,
women glide

by Russ Damtoft

Grinnell will take on Simpson
and Wartburg in a triangular in-
door track meet at 6:00 pm.
tonight in the Physical Education
Complex. This will be the Pioneers!
first meeting of the season with
Simpson. The team lost to Wart—
burg two weeks ago.

Dave Raub, Mike Nadalsky, and
Dan Heft each posted victories last
Week as Grinnell tied for third
place in a field that included
Luther, Monmouth, Central, and
Cornell.

Raub set a personal record with
a 9140.8 two-mile victory, while
Nadalsky jumpedél'lI/z" to win
the triple jump. Hoft ran 27.4 in the
220»yard hurdles, also good for
first.

Terry Seeberger took second
behind Luther’s Tim Williamson in
a close BBB-yard race. Jim Fallace
and Jim Briles took third and
fourth in the 440- yard dash, with
54.8and 55.5 times respectively.
Mark Schultz, placing fourth in a
tight 60-yard dash, rounded out
Grinnell’s individual scoring.

Grinnell took third in the mile
relay, and placed fourth (last) in
the 380 and two mile relays.

Depth was the chief problem for
the Pioneers in Friday’s per-
formance, being shut out com-
pletely in traditionally strong
events such as the mile and long
jump. Except for Nadalsky’s win,
no points were scored in the field
events.

Coach Richard Van Scotter noted
improvements this week, and was
guardedly optimistic about the
team’s chances in the conference
meet two weeks away.

Women remain undefeated

The women‘s team fared better,
beating Central by one point as
Chris Stidley and Jenny Paarlberg
recorded two Victories each.

Stidley won the shot put, in which
she had never competed before,
with a 28'6” heave, followed by
Cathy Lee in second with 25'10".
She also won the Maryard dash,
with a time of 59.1, edging out
teammate Janice Tave, inches
behind.

Paarlberg won the soryard dash
with a time of 7.6, and ﬁle ZZO-yard
‘dash With a 29.1 clocking.

Lisa Klose narrowly missed a
first in the mile, placing a strong
second in 5:55. She was followed by
Stidley in third with 6:22.

Sue Brown took third in the 60-
yard low hurdles.

The Women are hurting badly
from a lack of depth, and hope that
more runners will come out as the
season progresses.
