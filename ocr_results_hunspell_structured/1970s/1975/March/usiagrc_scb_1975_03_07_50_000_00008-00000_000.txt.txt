ISPIRG charges
privacy failure

Aconsumergroup today charged
that the us. Department oi
Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW7 has failed to develop
adequate safeguards to protect the
privacy of student records.

The Iowa Student Public Interest
Research Group (lSPIRG) joined
with several public interest groups
in other states filing comments to

' the proposed HEW regulations to
implement the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy
Act, as amended in November 1974
by the Buckley Amendment. The
statute, as amended, is designed to
protect the privacy of parents and
students by regulating access to
records maintained by educational
institutions and agencies, and the
release of such records. '

Bob Rhudy, executive director of
ISPIRG said. “Omissions in the
regulations regarding access to
student records are numerous.
HEW has failed to include in the
requirements standards recom»
mended by others concerned with
the issue and have left numerous
questions unanswered."

Rhudy made his comments in the
statement ISPXRG filed with HEW
regarding proposed lederal
regulations concerning the rights
of access of students to their files,

One omission HEW made, Rhudy
said, was a requirement [or the
institutions covered by the
proposed regulations to develop a
system to insure the security at the
student records.

“There is no provision for a
private remedy or discussion or its
availability if a specifcd staff
person Within an institution
violates a provision oi the
regulations," Rhudy said. ”It is
unlikely that the Office of
Education will stop the funding of
an institution for small violations
by employees of a school. An in
dividual whose rights have been
violated should have a remedy. If
HEW ieels a private one exists, it
should be stated."

Rhudy advocated providing for
imposing civil fines for violation
and abuse of the various record-
kecping procedures.

“There is little, if any, incentive
for an cdu ational institution to
comply 'Ith the regulations."
Rhudy said. “The only remedy is
overkill, The provisions of the act
to protect student privacy will
have greater elrcct if there is a

cvwhawepiher.

than total cutoff of funds,"
lsPlRG also suggested that
further protection for students can
he provided by requiring the
separation of certain files, such as
medical and psychological. “For
example," Hhudy said, “if there is
a need for scllools' officials to
obtain selected legitimate in
formation, there is no need [or
them to be exposed to or view other
types of information. Therefore,
the schools should develop, where
appropriate, categories oi
records which can be separated."

ISPIRG also recommended a
periodic review of “material that
could or should be kept." Rhudy
said material should be reviewed
[or its accuracy. completeness and
relevancy.

ISPIRG questioned the en-
forcement of federal regulations
regarding access to student files.
Rhudy charged there is a “definite
loophole" in such enforcement
This loophole could lead to delays
in eniorcement or up to three
years, Rhudy said.

“For example, suppose there is a
state legislature meeting now,
They fail to act this session to
provide compliance with federal
regulations and do not meet again
for two years. At the end of two
years they linally enact a bill
and set an effective date of another
year. During that time, the federal
law is meaningless."

ISPIRG recommended that
provision be made for federal
enforcement of regulations if state
government ”drags its feet,”

“Overall," Rhudy said, “the
regulations are too broad.
Although it is a laudable goal to
ease the requirements on a small
Country school, students at ins
stitutions oi higher learning should
not sutier from vagueness There
is a need to provide more attention
to thc righls of an individual than
to the bookkeeping desircs of the
Insitution "

”According to this standard,"
Rlludy said, “ISPIRG would
suggest that the proposed
regulations for the protection oi
student records fail as they provide
too, few safeguards against the
impediments that may be
established by administrators in
the local school district or at the
colleges and universities "
