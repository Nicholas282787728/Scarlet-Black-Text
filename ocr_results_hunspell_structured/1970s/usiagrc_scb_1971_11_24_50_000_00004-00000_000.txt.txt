the

Issues Anyone?

“The issue here is, ‘do we have an issue?’ ”

Thus said one Grinnell student at the meeting last Sunday evening in Herrick
Chapel, a meeting begun by several students concerned about what seemed to
be greatly increased academic pressure this semester.

The issue was not whether students had an issue in “academic pressure”
(for they did, even though that issue has become less and less the focus of
discussion in student meetings), but which, if any, of the many issues pos
sible, would be taken up by the group, Clearly many students wanted an issue,
or a reason to gather together as they did at the meeting in Herrick last
night and Sunday night: several juniors and seniors recalled the trequent
all campus "crisis” type gatherings of the past, and some asked for more
meetings this or next semester.

The problem was that many other students no longer feel the need for an
issue, or for meetings The above quoted student told the Sunday meeting:
Sure, we’re into academics more than before; We’re not involved in all
sorts of “issues” at the college or nationwide level; this is good, and we
should all pursue our studies with proﬁt.

And others disagreeonissues. Atthefirst meeting, students expressed per»
sorta! dissatisfaction with everything: the courses, individuals, students, the
Grinnell bureaucracy; opinions as to what students should do, though these
opinions were not too frequent and often very sketchy or partial, ranged from
more discussion, to a day without classes, to talking to the faculty at their
meeting, to “learning how to read”.

What of it all then? Was the meeting Sunday totally incoherent, and will the
issues developed at last night’s meeting provide even a momentary focus
for student energies and thought'.7 An unqualified yes on the first point, a
qualified yes on the second. All Grinnell student meetings -- at least all that
we have attended since September, 1968 -- are incoherent. But an order can
be imposed on them from outside, and this is where the answer to the second
question comes in.

Last night’s meeting was conducted according to an agenda made up by
several members of student government. Academic pressure was not specifi-
cally mentioned in any of the definite proposals for discussion, and most of
those who helped compose the agenda had reservations about the original
ideas which spurred Sunday’s meeting (the pressure issue and possible
solutions of it such as one or two days or no classes after Thanksgiving),
They and larger groups or students have worked, individually or collectively,
over the past few days to change the focus of the “pressure ” meetings on
to larger issues. Since there is a very tenuous concensus among students
about the issue itself, it was not at all difficult for this to be done.

Thus, the only signiticant result of the meetings of the last few days, he
sides the almost silent demise of the pressure issue, is that the issues that
students (who wish to) will follow in the future will be more or less formal
issues already being considered by student government and members of
college committees. We think this may be good; but it certainly indicates a
profound change from the atmosphere of the past. Those juniors and seniors
who yearned for the kind of meeting or their first year or two here may find
themselves disappointed, as those who felt students would mobilize and take
forceful action of some sort in response to feelings of ”academic pressure"
already seem to be.

The issue here is, we think, do we want an issue? Or did we just want a
chance to discuss our concerns with other students and with faculty members:
for the discussions themselves seem to have gone further toward relieving
tensions than toward defining an issue.

And, as many movies “set in the

portrayed (and i must admit quite
well), the classic opium dens do
persist within a complex matrix or

more depressed areas of town.

During the time or our stay, we had

After a history of ilicit opium lrafr
fic and widespread addiction among
urban centers, mDstSoutheast Asian
nations have firmly established their
authority in order to constrict and
sever the voluminous arteries of
supply. Several novel conditions,
however, make the most concerted
preventative measures far from
perfect.

Pure raw opium is still sold over
the counter in pharmacies and cig-
arette stands, and by wandering
impoverished vagrants in search
for a whiterskinned sucker through
out the whole of Laos (although the
best quality opium has always been
in Vietenne). Primitive hill tribes
in the northern highlands of Thais
land (and sporadically in lthe . other
Southeast Asian nations), have been
granted amnesty from the usually
stringent Thai regulation of the
drug. For years the poppy plant
has been used in Ihe Mao tribe's
ritualistic customs and incantations.

The Scarlet and Black

This time the turf was NorrisHall.
But tor ettect, just imagine Rick’s
Drive-In, the schoolgym,orWally’s
Soda Shop,

Pinpointing the time in history is
not easy, Archaeologists haveap-
proximated the period to be any-
where from the early ’50’s tothe mid
'60's. They concluded this by ob-
serving the hair styles, watchingthe
limbo and other dance stumbles, and
hearing “Satisfaction.”

I’m sure the greasers would der
light in the tact that they occupied
such an extensive niche in our 20th
century. But l don’t think thegrease
spread that far.

So, we will name the occasion, The
Anachronish Hop.

All the grease gangs were there.
Wildroct, Vitalis, Crisco, and from
the Jewish Side of town, Schmaltz.
Brylcream was the only gang miss-
ing. They were regrouplng after a
rumble a few days ago. A little dab
did it.

Lazy Beatniks

What brought these gangs out of
hiding? Were they all laying low in
Argentina? Where are the lazy beat-
niks, the fun-loving beachcumbers,
and the social rivalries of frater-
nities and sororities? Why grease-rs,
those furtive slippery misfits?

Just examine the stereotyped
greaser and you’ll uncover latent
characteristics of many Grinnell—
ians.

Let’s start with the conventional
sleeveless or rolledrup tee shirt.
Both offer boosts to the male virility
which has remained dormant for a
while. The rolled-up specimen, al-
though makeshift in nature, provides
the greaser with a suave cigarette
pack holder protruding tram the
shoulder. Anything that accommo-
dates cigarette smoking is worth its
weight in matches around here.

Then of course there are the gobs
of makeup and clatter or jewelry.
Freshmen girls tinally got to use
some. A few months agotheseprima
donnas came from their respective
high schools, looked around, and
noticed a lack of color and clatter.
They realized their faces would have
to make it on their own. Those are the
girls who coyly claim that they
haven't put a thing on their faces E)?

The Den

opium and old perspiration, and a
wallrpapered platform several feet
high supported by huge wooden legs.

At times only the owner of the den
was present: An emaciated skeletal
old man, darkly colored in
old man, darkly colored in yellow-
ish-brown from years and years of
addiction, his eyes sort of wonder-
ing about the room lost in one of his
endless “pipe~dreams”, andaslight
smile at the corner of his mouth at
the appearance of several cus-
tomers.

Other times greeted us with several
addicts: As emaciated and disc
colored as the old man, clad in thin
white shirts and long undershorts,
either heavily puttin on a pipe, just
sitting in a corner peering “at the
sky", or telling and enacting age»
old Chinese mythology in full thea»
trical electrics. Either presentation
was enough to chill the spine and
create second thoughts about the
entire matter.

Our friend would then speak with
the old man for several minutes,
utilizing the little Chinese he had
learned at the university. Since we
were not part of the “regular"
corps of customers, a short series
of bargaining would take place until
the price reached an reasonable
level, Then the old man wouldinvite
us to the platform, unpeel a fine
plastic packageolpure uncooked raw
opium and proceed to cook and knead
it at the endoiaiine metallicneedle.
Once the opium had been properly
cooked and placed in the stone head
of a special opium pipe, the smoker
would take the pipe in a reclining
position and inhale the smoke as
the Opium-fitled head was held over
the flickering flameoiasmallkeror
sene lamp. lt dldn‘t take long.

The Doppelt Effect

Watch Out For The Grease'

cept soap since freshman year in
high school,

From the greaser era, lest us not
forget the letterman sweater/black
leather jacket rivalry. The jackets
have retained their color and hide,
but are worn more for warmth than
status, It's comforting to know that
every time you pass a leather
jacketed human now, you don’t have
to face a pointed object and be
forced to exchange money for the
right to his part of the sidewalk.

Big G

But the letterman sweaters are
the shocker. In this land of No-
jocks, we still see the big G draped
on the most obtrusively blinding
red fabric. This denotes athletic
prowess, strength, and a warning
to “Beware," except in a tow cases
like me. I had a sweater for tennis
and had enough sand kicked in my
face to fill nine hourglasses. This
afforded the high school athletes,
since turned pacitists, an oppor-
tunity to return to their proud days
of yore, score, adore, whore, and
more.

Needless to say, agreaser wouldn't
be the same without his grease. lf
Delilah were only here now. Such
a hair-raising experience; barber-
ism that the world has never had a
part in. What innate or inane char-
acteristic would induce a Grinnell-
ian to call a meeting of all that
dispersed hair? (We are gathered
here today... ").

That is a puzzling question. Did
they feel their hair needed a place
to rest? Was the hair so disorganr
ized that it needed a leader like
grease to pull it together? Was
there a sale on combs? Had the
hair taken such a disgracetui turn
that it needed straightening out?,
Other questions are more sim-
pllstic. Why would people want to
do the limbo again and cause per»
manent spinal damage? The stu-
dents have been bending over back—
wards to get their work done, some
limbo is no drastic regression.

A greaser party also provides a
foolproof opportunity to drink, chug,
or guzzle beer. Any such event is
likely to be endorsed by Alph Sigma
Sigma and independent interest
groups.

Moral Escape

I fear the primary reason for a
greaser party instead of for any
other nostalgic era is because it
gives us the excuse to play tough,
pull knives, accost people, and re-
lease latent hostilities for a night.
Rousseau would have considered this
a moral escape valve and character-
ized it as a malady ofa society in
which the people feelthat they needa
break from the rules that havebound
them.

Make of that what you will. But the
greaser party this year was a failure
compared to the extravaganza last
year in Loose. Maybe the age or the
greaser is dying out?

Convey: Hope, Despair

by Greg Vranicar

More than 25 Grinnell students and
several faculty members and ad»
ministrators journeyed to Ames last
Saturday night to hear a Methodist
lay preacher from lda Grove talk
about the current political scene in
America. You ask, Why would so
many people bother aboutthat?

The preacher was also a United
States Senator, his name was Harold
Hughes, and for the people who saw
him, no more needs to be said.

The event was the lowa Democratic
Party’s JeffersonJackson Day ans
nual fund-raising dinner. Normally
the price of admissions would have
prohibited college students from
attending, but as a special gesture,
young people could get in on a
special $2 ticket.

Although the long wait for the food
and the series of “rive—minute”
speeches (every one was at least 10
minutes) by the five prospective
Democratic gubernatorial candi-
dates were not too much appreciated,
participants certainly got their
money‘s worth when Hughes took to
the podium.

It is difficult to recreate the ways
in which Senator Hughes gets his
message across; everyone should
see him to appreciate it. His talk
Saturday consisted of three parts.
First, he wanted to clarify remarks
he made in lowa City acouple weeks
ago about the influence of big labor
on the recent light for the 1972
Democratic Convention Credentials
Committee Chairmanship. He made
it clear that his outspoken criticism
is not reserved for labor but wtllbe
aimed at anyone who tries to control
the Democratic Party which he be
lieves should be truly democratic.
He discussed what he sees as the
major issue of the upcoming year-7
the restoration and revitalization of
the political system to respond di-

rectly to the people’s needs.

Disposing with the clarification of
his Iowa City speech, Hughes went
on the attack against the conditions
of the country and the lack of res
pause to those conditions by the
Nixon administration, Centering his
remarks first on Iowa and its prob»
lems and then moving to national
issues, Hughes created in all who
listened carefully a strange tension
between hope and despair. strongly
critical of the President’s nomina-
tion of large corporate farmingpro—
ponent Earl Butz tor Secretary or
Agriculture, Hughes scored big with
the crowd in promising to do every
thing he canto defeat Butz’s appoints
men.

it was when Hughes discussed the
war, the drug problem, alienation
between blacks and whites, Con-
gressional and campaign spending
retorm, and prison conditions, that
he seemed to impress the Grinnell
delegation the most. Maintaining that
there is no easy solution to any of
these issues, he lashed out at pre
sent American leaders who don’t
even seem to recognize the prob-
lems. He challenged everybody to
work to get rid of present leaders
who do not even admit that the pre-
sent system perpetuates injustice
and dehumanization.

The simple and poweriul torce.
fulness of Hughes' remarks im—
pressed everyone with whom this
reporter had a chance to speak.
There was universaldisappointment
among the Grinnell delegation that
such a good man dropped out of the
Presidential race so early. Several
people asked if it was already too
late to invite Hughes to Grinnell as
commencement speaker. Although
it may be too late to do so, the
college may want to consider such
a choice. For, in my opinion, we
could not do much better than the lay
preacher from lda Grove.
