by Shelly Blair

Several students are among
people in the Grinnell area that
have been watching themselves on
Tv latelyinot on the national
networks or on any educational
stations, but on the playback
monitors at the videorstudio in the
physical education complex.

Video services at the College is
relatively a new phenomenon. it
started when a trustee, Mr, E. s.
Hewitt, donated video equipment
to the college during last Christ-
mas break. From there, Dean
Waldo S. Walker purchased sup-
plementary equipment, and
equipment was added that was
iormerly oi the communications
department. Eventually, Building
and Grounds converted a room in
the PE complex into a video studio,

tape that can be played back im-
mediately on the TV monitors.
However, the technical and
electronical signal in the video
tape does not meet the regulations
of the Federal Communications
Commission to be broadcast over
network or educational television.

Steve LaRGCue, college coor-
dinator of video services, said that
he hopes that Grinnell will even-
tually install a cable system for
closed circuit broadcasting. This
will enable video tapes produced in
the college video studio to be
broadcast on an educational
station or irom the college studio to
various places around the college.

Among the equipment at video
services is a portarpak camera
which can make video tapes oi
outside events such as football
games or concerts. The portapak
was used to tape much of the
recent alumni weekend.

from Mike Winston

The question of energy
dominated the weekend Iowa
Student Public Research Interest
Group (lSPlRGl conference held
in Ames last weekend.

Members from all over the state
adopted a position paper that
called for guidelines on trans
sportation construction in Iowa.
The major locus was placed on the
“reinvention” of the rail system,
which the group considered
energyrefficient but currently
degraded. ISFIRG lobbyists are
likely to actively promote position
at the new legislative session in

January The paper has already-

been presented to representatives
oi the railroad services in lowa.

The delegates could not decide
on a position paper ior use oi
atomic energy, but did develop a

Children's show

The College community has
already used the video services in
various ways. For example, the
video characteristic of instant
playback has been used ior the
educational purposes oi theatrical
production. student teaching, and
athletics, Another program in its
early stages is a Children’s video
creative dramatics program on
Saturday mornings,

Two basic opportunities are open
to people who wish to use the video
services Grinnell College.

One of these is to be involved in
video production. Production work
is not limited to those with ex,
perience, and the video services
will hold workshops during the
year so that students can learn how
to produce video tapes. Currently,
camera workshops are being held.

Technicians

The college video services
already has several people with
previous experience and a iew
technicians. But LaRocqlle said
that there are still openings [or
interested Students who wish to
learn about video production and
then be paid for their work. He said
that pelple doing technical work
receive $130 an hour and thal four
or iive people are involved in each
production.

The other opportunity open to
students is the use of Video services
for special projects, For example,
one student is currently adapting a
French literary work to video tape
tor a French independent.

Require Dcan'sapproval

All special projects have to be
approved by the Dean. ii a student
has a special project that he or she
would like [u Viedo tape, it must
first be taken to LaRocque. He
would write a lormal estimate of
the cost and submit it to the Dean
to receive permission ior the
production. Other projects such as
a student teaching situation may
be done on used tape and do not
require special permission or the
allocation of money.

One important aspect of the new
service is the video library which
will be accessible to anyone in the
community. LaRocque said that he
will eventually put out a list of the
contents of the video library so that
people may see video tapes by
appointment.

Boost communications

LaRocque said he has a lot to
learn about the creative and
technical possibilities of the
equipment and would like to learn
along with interested students. He
also said that he hopes the video
services will be valuable for
academic purposes as well as help

paper advocating payment for
advertising oi public utilities irom
stockholder proiits. Discussion on
the Land Use bill pending before
the town legislature did not evolve
into a formal lSPIRG position
paper.

Finances constituted a major
worry for the delegates. They
expressed disaLisfaction with the
current voluntary donation
system, saying that it severely
restricts iunding Formerly the

group was able to automatically
collect iunds when tuition was
paid, and refusals were repaid
upon request only.

Contributions are poor, due to
the national economic crisis. In
view of the current funding
situation, members are concerned
with the problems oi [inding money
to pay staff member lees.

ISPIRG lobbying will formally
begin in January at the start of the
new legislative session.

Boycoi’i passes

On Wednesday, the Grinnell
students who are on board voted to
iully support the boycott of iceberg
lettuce not picked by members oi
Cesar Chavez’ United Farm
Workers Union, for example the
Teamsters Union, Despite the low
number of students who turned out
to vote tor the measure, slightly
under half of those who were
eligible, the measure passed with a
three to one margin oi “yes" votes
over ”no" ones. The actual vote
was as ioilows:

Pei Policy

President Leggett has approved
a new policy concerning dogs
owned by off-campus students and
iaculty.

Any dog brought onto the
campus must be on a leash
(maximum length of seven feet)
attached to a person No one may
walk more than two dogs and a dog
will not be allowed in any College
building.

SGA deemed necessary to make
the action binding.

Jenny Bass, one of the
organizers of the pro-United Farm
Workers faction and supporter oi
the total boycott, was “happy”
with the results oi the reterendum.
She was, however, a bit
“dismayed" by the “obvious
apathy” oi the voters as indicated
by the low turnout.

The effect of the referendum will
actually be nothing. It will result in
a continuation oi last year’s policy
of serving only United Farm
Workers iceberg or head lettuce in
both Quad and Cowles dining
rooms, as well as in the Forum
Grill. When that lettuce is not
available from the distributor the
Saga food service will substitute a
non-boycotted kind oi lettuce, e.g.
Romaine or leaf, or serve no let-
tuce at all.

Chaser story

by Tom Paiitea

A sunny warm day ushered in the
First Annual Great Bicycle Chase
last Sunday afternoon at Merrill
Park in Grinnell. It began at 2:20
p.m., with a one-lap race or a mile
and a half for the lD-andmnder age
group, iollowed by five more races.

The oneclap was won by Bruce
Dawson of Grinnell with a time of
5.41 minutes. He was followed by
Rick Severson and Chris Groves.
both of Grinnell.

A two-lap was broken down into
two heats, one (or 11-12 year olds
and one [or 1345 year olds. Newton
resident Carmen Urius captured
the 11-12 year old race, followed by
Sally Mathews and Tim Seller,
both of Grinnell. The second saw
Jonathan Haas coast with a H.21,
followed by John Kissane and
David Haas.

Four and a half miles was the
next distance taken on, in the

finished first with 3 12,56 lime,

oi Langan hall.

The five-lap Chase followed with
Grinnell residents Kissane (in 22.33
minutes) and Mike Stewart
grabbing iirst and second and Al
Owens of Norris Hall finishing
third.

Finally the Climax race of 12
miles (3 laps) concluded, with Rad
Acton of Dibble hall on top in 31.53
minutes. He was followed by Karl
Delong and Alan Kissane, both of
Grinnell.

Trophies

Rick Stein, owner of Rick’s Bike
Shop. sponsored the chase,
provided the trophies, and donated
iood for the 46 participants. The
trophies were not the average dust
collectors either. Old bike parts
such as handle bars, innertubesi
lights, and gears were concocted
into original designs by Rick and
friends to honor the winners.

The Chase gave many their first
chance to race. Fortunately, with
the coming spring, Kick said more
community races plus bike tours
will be planned, with great chances
that a bike‘ club will also be
established. , ‘ ' , - ~
