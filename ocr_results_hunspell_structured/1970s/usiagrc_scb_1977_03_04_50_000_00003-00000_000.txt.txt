is the president’s responsibility to
preside atJoint Board meetings, to
represent the SGA to the president
of the College, the faculty and the
student body. The president can sit
as a nonrvoting member on any
SGA committee, and, if the
committee agrees, may sit on any
faculty or administration come

Tom Parsons,
sophomore

The 8&3 asked Hassey,
Neiderbach and Parsons the same
questions. Although it was not

{possible to print the complete
. responses of the candidates, the
main points of each interview have

‘been included,

Wily did you decide to run for SGA
president?

Ilassey: Basically, it’s to help me
get experience in dealing with
groups of people , , l‘m cons
sidering law school or business
school, and the experience I get
from this would be excellent.

Neiderbach: Essentially. I feel
that I am a very qualified and
experienced administrative type,
and that I can bring a certain
i aunt of innovatiun and new
ideas to the job.

Parsons: As a concemed student
and one who has been involved

with the issues before, I feel that i ‘

'Zi‘ave the experience and
knowledge which would help me,
and directly help the entire
campus, ii i become president

What importance does SGA have
on campus?

Hassey: In the course oi this year,
the SGA has gained some

respectability to the ad
ministration, I see the SGA as
mainly being the voice box for
the students,

Neidcrbach: SGA serves mainly to
provide for the social life and the
service needs of the student
community. They provide a way to
allocate the student activities fee
and also a number of services
through the Student Coordinator’s
Office that help students get along
better at Grinnell. I think that the
event of this past fall indicates that
there is something radically
wrong with the student input
system at Grinnell, and I think that
it is the role of SGA to act as
bargaining agent for the students.
Parsons: A lot at proposals which
govern the student body pass
through SGA committees and
eventually the Joint Boards and
come beiore the president . The
SGA acts as a liaison etween
faculty and administration and
Students in describing issues and
prescribing the best alternatives
and eventually the best solutions to
the problems that arise.

What makes you the best candidate
tor the job?

IIassey: I feel that I’ve been
perceptive enough this year to see
the fallacies of the SGA. I feel that
I have the leadership capabilities
and qualities to organize groups of
people and to . get the opinions of
other students more effectively
than has been done this year.
Neidei'hach: I’m trying to run an
issueroriented campaign and
without sounding too immodest. I
think that my opinions and my
issue positions are somewhat in
jive with the campus, At least I
hope they are.

Parsons: Right now, I'm dealing
with issues that are prominent
issues on campus. rma member or
an EPC, and have been involved
with hiring and evaluating faculty.
I’m alsu a member of the Initiative
Fund. Ihuve served on the Student
Publications and Radio Com-
lnlttee, and as a rep for a specialty
dorm. the IDC

What have been some of SGA‘s
positive accomplishments this
year?

llassuy: SGA has stood up to the
administration reorganization and
they have stood up to the ad
ministration. It was about time
that the administration realized
that the students do have some say
in what goes on with the branches
of the administration that directly
concern the students.
Neidcrbach: Well, happily, student
government managed to play a
very important role in the right
against the administration's
reorganization. There was a broad
coalition formed which effectively
fought the administration’s
proposal. 1 think the fact that
Georgia Dentel and Kathy MCV
Cluskey have their jobs, at least on
a temporary basis, is directly
attributable to SGA.

Parsons: SGA did a good job in
Summoning a lot of student interest
in the administrative reorgan-
ization and in the White Paper.
SGA has proven that it can
set up a lot of special student
services. such as the shuttle buses
to Des Moines. SGA has also had to
deal with certain social and
political questions, such as the
black cluster system, I think that
we adequately dealt with that
question.

Jon Neiderbach,
junior

What have been some of SGA‘s
iaiiures this year?

Hassey: Basically I see them as
being a group which has broken up
into many sections, the cabinet
doing everything, and the hall reps
and the rest of the student body not
being very involved. This was an
exceptional yedreit was a year oi
reaction in which various groups

were proclaiming loudly. . , There ,

could have been a better
organization of the student voice.

Neiderhachzlf SGA had been what
it should be, I feel that an outside
organization, OSA, would never
have been necessary, I think the
tact that many students did not go
to SGA is an indication that in some
ways, SGA has become too
bureaucratized, too fixed in a web
oi power systems and competing
interests, and not directly
responding to a ielt need that was
definitely widespread at the time.

Parsons: I feel that SGA could
have done more in terms of in-
formation flow. I would like to see
the Joint Board minutes published
in the Campus Memo, and the Joint
Board agendas published in the
son and the campus as a whole
invited to those meetings. Also, I
think that the iobs of student
coordinator. president, and vice
president have to be defined to the

whole campus. A lot of people don‘t
know the duties of the cabinet
members, and are not aware of the ,
iaci that they can go to them with
specific problems.

What would you change about
sod? '
liassey: I feel that there should be
a total reorganization of the SGA.
tone) aspect ott rganization is
outlining respons' ies of the hall
coordinators and hail reps. There
was a committee formed last
semester to deal with this topic.
but I don't know ii anything was
done. The SC should assume
more responsib ity ior coming up
with creative ways oi spending
their money. This mainly concerns
all»campus events, There should be
a big effort next year to make
students familiar with the Dober
report.

Neiderbach: By and large I think
SGA should be more Open in
communication with the EPC'S.
Also, I think there should be a
considerable expansion oi SGA’s
role into curricular matters. into
matters relating to the power
structure on the campus.
Parsons: I would like to come out,
next year. with a publication at the
beginning of each semester with
pictures and information about all
the people in the government;
descriptions oi all the com-
mittees—to really expose the
Campus community to all the
people who are making the
decisions. The students to a great
extenthave to be the conscmusness
of the administration. The students
have to face up to and come
mu 'cate with the faculty and
administration, and really let them
know how they stand,

What speciiic proposals. issues.
problems would you plan to deal
with next year?
Ilassey: I would like to see the
student government looking into
the possibility oi having a drug and
alcohol counselor on the campus

Onethmg that came out
ol the reorganization was the
Iormatlon oi the student input
committee and the committee for
affirmative action. In principle
they are very good committees and
I'm glad that they were formed,
However. they are not really
responsible to SGA‘, they're
dealing with the cabinet positions
only, You’re going to have to in-
clude the rest of SGA

A lot of responsibil v lies with
the hall reps, being led by the
president. Hopefully, I'll be able to
get to know the reps better, and
iind out a way that we can work as
effectively as possible, Students

SGA presidential candidates interviewed

are not apathetic when there is
good communication.

Nciderbach: My first and absolute
priority as SGA president would be
to work to improve the channels of
student input into the campus
decisionrmaking process as it is
now

My second deiinite priority is
towards a whole bunch of feminist
issues along the lines oi ai-
llrmativeaction, I think SGA ought
to establish a permanent ai-
firmative action policy compliance
review committee. Also, I think
SGA shoulddo all it possibly can
to strongly encourage the
development or an in
terdisciplinary women studies
program

And iinally, regarding SGA it-
self, I think Joint Boards ought to
clean its own house. I think that
SGA ought to establish some
system to make hall represen-
tatives more accountable to the
halls. ‘

Parsons: I think that the first
problem I would have to deal With
would be the EPC’S, since that is
both a social and an academic
issue. I’d also like to deal with
affirmative action, We have to
examine the function of RA’s, SA's,
and maybe even the iunction of
reps and coordinators, I’d like tn
establish the position of general
media liaison, someone who could
be in touch with the different
sources of information on campus.
