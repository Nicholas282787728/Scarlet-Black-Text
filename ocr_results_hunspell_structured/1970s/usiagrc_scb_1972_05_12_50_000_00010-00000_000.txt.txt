"Women have been very slo\\ to
seek elective office at the state
level Ili fact. across the country
at the present. tewer \t‘oemen are
in office than have been at various
titnes in the past, Women must
take responsibility [or improving
their own positions," said loua
State Representative John Lipsky,
expressing a recurring theme ofthe
“Women in Politics" symposium,
Students and Women [rpm the come

world. If any at you have seen, as
I have, women in the Middle East
hidden under veils and doing iust
as their parents or husbands say,
you will understand the historical,
universal need tor an improvement
in women’s status.”

Shelley lands A Job Here

by Lynne Ogawa

Shelley Floyd, "72, who “wasn‘t
that impressed" with Grinnell when
she first Visited here will be the
first recent graduate employed by
the Development Office, Under Mr.
James Avison, vicerpresident in
charge or resources planning,
Shelley will be connected with
alumni aliairs and fund raising. And
as the past SGA president, she’s
had good experience in both areas.

I'm really enthusiastic about it,”
says Shelley. ”Alumni really apprer
ciate honesty” and “students or re—
cent graduates can speak with more
candor, not because they're moreu
honest but because they've had more
direct experience with campus,”
she says alumni seem to appreciate
having different points of View and
the most successful alumni affairs
Shelley has attended had disagreer
ments in student Opinions

According to Shelley, traveling and
meeting diiterent kinds oi people are
the biggest attractions oi the you
Where Shelley goes depends on the
budget but the biggest Concentra-
tion OI alumni is in St Louis, Chi-
cago. New York and California, and
no doubt she will be, seeing some of
those places soon.

Except for being involved with
alumni and lurid raising, Shelley’s
duties are still undefined, She might
work with older alumni or perhaps
younger alumni, but in either case,
she would try to explain what stue
dents are about today, By talking
about Grinnell, Shelley Ieels she will

he doing something satistying; “a
lot OI people don't understand what's
going on in colleges today."

Shelley intended to take some time
0ft trom school and the experinlene
tal joti oiiered a unique opportunity,
however, she does not plan to stay
over a year. A HistoryeMath mayor,
she hopes to continue studying his
tory at graduate or divinity school.

Shelley became interested in re
ligion when she took medieval his»
tory "I’m really intrigued by the
church as a Social and ideological
force I'm also interested in the

~hist0rv of ideas and the church is

one way to study that " It Shelley
does attend divinity school, her Cmr
phasis will be on the history or
religions: “I don't Want to be a
minister "

In her first public speech of the
school year, Shelley advocated more
parties and notes “people seem to be
more relaxed and social than last
year. You see more people having
tun. . .more of the wacky, collegee
tunster type spirit " still, "there’s
an anlul lot of loneliness here and
the campus is more atomistic than
I'd like it to be, " Shelley is
sorry that in some cases students
seem to want it so.

Now that Shelley is no longer bound
by otticiztl duties, she has been gete
ting papers and math iinals done.
Before that she helped with the De—
mocratic party iunctiotis and right
after her term ended, “I was busy
taking it easy."

Senator Doderer and chi-esene

piloting the Amendment through the
Iowa Legislature this spring. “It
was passed hecuuse legislators
thought women might be ieady to

accept excuses for a vote against

She added that strong opposition to

urged student s to work for i-nti-
fication at home if their state is
one of the 35 that have not yet
accepted the amendment.

Senator Doderer and Assistant
Attorney General Conlin spoke
warmly about women’s rights to cone
trol their bodies, They advocated enr
torcement of rape laws and access
to contraceptives and uhortion. But
neither woman was optimistic about
immediate changes in the Iowa aborr
tion law because ot the growing
strength ot Right to Lite groups.
Senator Doderer campaigned for
Lieutenant Governor in 1964 on a
platiorm that included abortion re»
form,

“One problem with this issue,"
she said, “is that like on many
others, opponents are more active
than supporters. I led the issue
in 1964 and the followers didn’t
come with me. There was talk but
no money or work, other politicians
have seen this and they are airaid.
I think the only way to do nnyr
thing now is to Collect 100,000
signatures. The legislature could not
ignore that.”

Discussing the coming election,
Assistant Attorney General Conlin
stated her support tor Shirley
Chisholln’s candidacy "None of its
think that She will get the notiiinztr
tion, but she IS heirig treated by
many as a serious, viahle candidate.
l agree with her on nearly every
issue, Chisholm is important bee
cause she is making way ior other
women to come after her as presir
tIential candidates ”

When asked about campaign issues
of special importance to women, the
Assistant Attorney General said,
“Women make up over Iifty per-cent
oi the population Everything
concerns themeethe Wat's-QVVGI‘Y’
thing All issues are women s is
