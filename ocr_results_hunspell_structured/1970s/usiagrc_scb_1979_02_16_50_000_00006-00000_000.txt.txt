Stewart stars as the idealistic
Jefferson Smith, a former Boy
Scout leader, who finds himself
elected to the U.S. Sehate. Thrust
into the corrupt political arena,
Smith becomes a champion of good
government, eventually over
earning his dishonest. conniving

Stewart is the perleet choice to
play the naive, down to earth hero,
a character type he has continued
to play throughout his career.
Claude Rains is excellent as it

Makaveycv, is an interesting
example or tilm montage. a
collection oi documentary and
fictional segments dealing with
fascism, revolution, love, sex, and
freedom,

In |he words of the director’
“The film is very complicated.” A
hint to its meaning is given in the
film‘s introductory credits, where
it is stated that the Work is a
personal response to the life and
work of Wilhelm Reich, 2! Marxist
who advocated the practice of free
sex in revolutionary movements.
Reich believed sexual freedom was
an essential element in political
freedom; “WE" is based upon this
premise

The film explores the connection
between personal happiness and
political freedom by means of
Makaveyev’s film collage, a
technique that juxtaposes footage
of Reich's practices with those of
the Stalinist regine, and the
political and sexual activities of
American youth with thatot young,
Yugoslavian revolutionaries.
These segments are pieced

together to produce a powerful
indictment of past and existing
political organizations,

Makaveyev's political statement
is tempered by the film's light-
hearted erothlsm which at times
borders on hard core pornography.
ln illustrating the interplay bet
ween sex and politics, the director
reveals his own ideal, shared by
Reichia world of sexual and
political freedom. Nevertheless, he
leaves interpretation of the film to
the viewer, intentionally leaving
many questions unanswered,
Makaveyev’s aim is the audience’s
emotional participation in the film
and in this he is quite successful.

“Wit—Mysteries of the
Organism” succeeded in winning
the grand prize at the Cannes Film
Festival despite being banned in its
native land. The dialogue alterr
natcs between English and Serbo-
Croatian, the latter accompanied
by English subtitles.

Finally. by way oi reminder,
Alfred Hitchcock's “Rebecca”
(reviewed in last week's issue) will
be shown Friday nightin ARH
