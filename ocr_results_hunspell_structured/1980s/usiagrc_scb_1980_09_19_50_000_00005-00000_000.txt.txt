which raises the suspicions oi the

system She considers protecting the
transcript a longri'un institutional conr

abuses the ‘Erase,' said Frazer, "the
transcript doesn't tell me, as a prospec-

the present system ”unrealistic.‘ ~it's

Frazer also expresses concern about
the current systems untairness, "The
dilltgeitt studénl who sticks with a Class
and gets a U is penalized.“ she said.

preter to give one ‘erasurc‘ to each siu~

Grinnell." She said

Drake believes that a sludenl should
be able to retake a tailed course The
second grade would go on the record
and replace the U U grade pOints in come
putatioii oi the student's G P A. "i
would be lor having the option to wipe it

dent's proticiency in that area," said
Drake.

Students should Still be able lo drop
courses, Drake believes, but the time in
which to do so should be shortened to
about two neeits Currently. students
may drop a course up to the 13th week
ot classes The option to drop courses is
not tor the student who lezii's a 'B, but

liy Wendy Babbitt

"If you are currently a sophomore
and have an interest in a career in
politics or government, why not com-
pete (or the Truman Scholarship?" ask-
ed Chairman of the Truman Scholar-
ship Committec, Professor Walter
Stone,

The Truman Scholarship is an award
bestowed by the Foundation of Con
gress to qualified students with an in-
terest in public service careers. The
scholarship, which is presented to one
nominee from each state. awards the
nominee 3 $5,000 stipend for each of his
last two years or college and tor each or
his lirst two years of graduate school.

The process begins with the competir
lion at Grinnell with an entrance set (or
October 3. The qualitications are a
strong academic record with a least a
3.0 GP A. and an interest in pursuing a
career in some aspect of public service

didate to submit a hriet essay.

The Truman Scholarship Committee

against other students in their own

another essay analyzing some aspect of
public policy. it the committee accepts
this essay, the nominees are then
selected [or interview; by the Truman
Foundation at the regional level.

Last year Jim Goodlellow from
Wisconsin, and Sharon McKee from
Iowa were selected as the scholarship
nominees irom Grinnell. Goodfellow
went on to win the scholarship, Though
Goodiellow concedes that it is a lot of
work, he also feels that it a worthwhile
thing for anyone interested in a
career in government or servtng in
some governmental bureaucracy, “The
money is nice, but bettering oneseli
through the application process is the
key to this program," Goodfellow ex.
plained,

According to Stone, more Grinnell
students could he applying tor this pro—
gram than the average six to 12 who do.
“I .would like to encourage as many
people to apply as tit those criteria and
have any interest in public service."
