on despondent chord

by Rob Brooks

The Grinnell football team concluded
its season Saturday with a 286 1055 to
Knox College. The loss marked the
eighth straight deleat tor the Pioneers,
who, after a seasonbpening win over
Chicago, lost the rest at their games,
ending at a 1-8 record (1.7 in the
Midwest Conference).

The Knox game was one of Grinnell's
finer offensive showings, based on
statistics. Mark Kohlmann carried the
ball so times for 140 yards, second only
this season to Gene Reid’s lsﬁ yard
game against Chicago. The 36 carries
by Kohlmann broke the record of 35
carries set by Washington Alston In
1974.

In all, the Pioneer oftense totaled 301
yards, 192 of which came on the ground.
The remaining log yards came from the
combined efforts of Tom Hanseter (36

0n 'hlesday. NOV, la, the Grinnell
women‘s basketball team opens their
1980 season against Indian Hills of 0t-
tumwa. The game is scheduled to start
at 7 pm. in Darby gymnasium.

Last season. the women finished at
ioii, placing third in the Midwest Con-
terence tournament. Coach Merry
Ormsby feels that this will be a
'rebuilding season due to the number of
young players on the team,

The only returning starter irorn last
year is junior Paula Moon. However,
last year Sarah Brichford, Kathy
Sessler, and Rose Strunk were all in
London {or the first semester. This
season they will be Wiﬂl the team for
the whole year.

Two lreshmen who are expected to
see much playing time are Lisa In-

The lone Grinnell score came wmi
1:09 lett in the game on a oneyard
plunge by Schumacher.

However, the Pioneers earlier had a
long drive lulled by a tumble on the
Knox one yard line by Hanseter. Also, a
24—yard TD pass from Hanseter to
Kohlmann was called back because of a

penalty.

Despite the 1-3 record, the team has
improved lrom last year. One reason
why there weren't more wins is the loss
of last season’s AllrMidwost Conference
running back Gene Reid, He missed
much of the season because of an ankle
injury. The team was made up mostly
of freshmen, In most games, there were
to or more freshmen in the starting
lineup. “It’s tough for the freshmen
who are starting because they haven't
had anyone to watch and learn from
while being on the bench,” said coach
Ed Dombrowskl.

point guard and Harker is a iorward
who excells on defense.

Since the team is not well-endowed
with height, they will use their
quickness as much as possible. “We are
a small, quick team," said Ormsby.
“We will fast-break a lot,”

“We’ve shown a tremendous amount
of hustle on defense.” she continued. “I
have a lot of confidence in this team and
l leel that it we can reach our potential,
we will place well in the conference
tournament,
