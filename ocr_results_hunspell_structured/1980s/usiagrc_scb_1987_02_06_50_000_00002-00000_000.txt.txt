“Poverty has taken on a iemale face,”
said Eleanor Holmes Norton. ”because
traditionally in America the poor have
been iamilies. With the increase oi
households headed by women, it has
become clear who has the economic power
in this country. and who doesn‘t.
Women,..do not."

Holmes Norton was interviewed en route
to Grinnell from Des Moines, the night
beiore delivering this week’s convocation
address. “The Feminization oi Poverty,”
which concluded the Roseniield Sym-
posium on Poverty and Homelessness.

After receiving graduate and law
degrees from Yale, over the next twenty
years Holmes Norton served as a law
clerk, assistant legal director oi the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),
executive assistant to Mayor Lindsay oi
New York. Chair oi the New York City
Human Rights Commission. Chair oi the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commis
sion (EEOC). and in her present position

A: All of this. .hasn‘t come out of a
vacuum. There is a reason why in the
1950's. One man. one white‘man. couid sup-
port iour or live children, send them to col-
lege, buy two cars, all on one salary, and
why nobody can do that anymore. There's
enormous weakness in the American
economy, and it needs to be addressed
beiore exploring solutions to this new

poverty.

Q2 What [actors have contributed to this
weakness?

A: The economy has been weak [or fifteen
years. This President just made it weaker
by precipitating the worse recession since
the great depression, His early tax cuts
built up an incredible delicit and he wants
everyone excited over 7% unemployment,
Americans seem to believe that 7% is nor
mal. That is terrifying.

Q: How do you suggest we deal with these
problems?

 

“There is a reason why in the 1950’s...one white
man could support four or five children, send them
to college, buy two cars all on one salary, and why
nobody can do that anymore.”

 

as a Professor ol Law at Georgetown. She
has also authored a law text. Sex
Discrimination and the Law: Causes and
Remedies. li you’ve ever seen her.
chances are she was on PBS or ABC; she is
a member oi tharrariiied group or people
routinely called upon to do battle with con-
servatives on MCNeil/Lehrer. Nightline.
Holmes Norton had spent more time in
transit between D.C. and Des Moines than

'she had expected to and was tired, but

agreed to be interviewed anyway.

Questionstwhat implications does the
feminilation of poverty hold for America?

Answer: It is very dangerous because
women are the surrogates oi the next
generation. Their Children will start out
severely compromised, and without luck
or intervention, they will be less produc»
Live as citizens and workers. This is not a
matter of small concern in a country that
has already become noncompetitive in a
world economy.

Q: What do you attribute the increase oi
people living in poverty to?

A: We’ve got to get a “whole economy”
again. Some parts oi the country are
devastated, while others are booming.
Compare New England and me Southwest
(Texas. Louisiana) to New England and
that region a few years ago. Then,
everybody was going to Houston, Now,
people are ileeing. There is a rust belt in
middle America,,.aii the high-paying
manufacturing jobs which created a mid
dle class in the first place have been
vacuumed out These kinds of disparities
and inconsistencies invite the continuing
spread oi poverty. ‘

it is diiiicuit because we can't just tinker
with our own economy, we have to really
realize we’re part oi a world economy. our
present administration does not believe in
any kind oi intervention in the tree market
economy. but to trust that it will all shake
out iine. that it is periect. is suicidal.

o: Especially wlicn other world economies
do not operate in the same way?

A: Exactly. Every other industrialized
country intervenes in order to give direc-
tion 'to its economy and build on its
strengths.
