What Did the Butler See

The Grinnell College Depart
ment oi Theatre will present
“What the Butler Saw" this
weekend, Dcceinbel i. 8 and ‘J, at
8:110 pm. in Arena Theatre.
“Butler” is the final work by Joe
Orton. who is considered by some
critics to be the iinest writer or
British stage tarce since Oscar
Wilde.

Director Kevin L, McKeough
considers ”Butler" to be "one ot
the tunnics plays in contemporary
drama.” McKeough indicated he
selected the play ior production on
the basis oi Orton’s “outrageous,
daring humor." “It appealed to
me.” he eontineud. “because it
took risks, and exercised great in
geiiuity in iinding iresh, exciting
ways to be funny."

Much oi the play's humor is
derived irom the irantic series oi
deceptions and errors which com-
prise its plot. Set in a private men-
tal clinic. the play opens with the

attempts of Dr. Prentice (played
by Joe Raffertyl, to seduce his
new secretary (Beth Albrechtt.
No sooner does the secretary con~
ceal herself behind the curtains of
the office's consulting couch, then
does Mrs. Prentice walk i [are
ing her husband into the t' ‘t of a
series of deceptions on which he
must rely. to conceal his ac-
tivities

The subsequent arrival oi a

an ofticious government inspector
tMalt Thomas). and an m.
dustrious police sergeant (Donnie
Cotter), add to Prentice's dif-
iiculties, torcing him into increas-
ingly frantic and confusing decep-

frenzied, hilarious finale

McKeough believes that While

This semester, the campus has been treated to a film

festival which, among other things, exhibits one
director’s ability to work with the mediums of Black and
White. When working with the two, contrast is the key.
But, along with the great works of Hitchcock the campus
has’beeii-treated to another exhibition of Black-White
Contrast in film. To date, the only feature-length films
which have spotlighted African—American artists or con»
cerns have been 48 Hours and Richard Pryor. Live on
Sunset Strip. We’ve seen Whites portrayed in all aspects
from the noble idiot, to the master artist. We’ve seen
'Blacks portrayed as the clown. The Films Chair may
have completed this slight purely in the spirit of humor,
with no malice intended, but African-Americans on this
campus ought to be served better not merely because
they deserve better but because there is better.

was clearly havtng iun putting all
the pieces together. The play's

While first and foremost a com-
edy. the play has “a very dark.
very serious side." McKeough
said. Orton exploited his asylum
setting in order to comment upon
the standards of normality which
5 ciety imposes upon the in
dividual and the punishment
which it administers to those who
violate those standards.

denied all individuals for the sake

McKeough said. "but my initial
concern is that the audience find it
as iunny and enjoy its daring as
much as 1 do "
