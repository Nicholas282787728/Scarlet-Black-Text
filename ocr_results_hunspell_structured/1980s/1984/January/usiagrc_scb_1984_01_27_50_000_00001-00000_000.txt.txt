Chair’s resignation

by Jeffrey Raymond

A disagreement with the ad-
ministration on the eligibility of
white candidates for the Afro
American literature postion has
led to the resignation of Professor
James Kissane as the English
Department chairman. Kissane
has not resigned from the taculty
and will continue his teaching
duties.

College President George
Drake said, "We felt that we
should do everything in our power
to assure that a black person fills
that Job (AfrosAmerican
literature professor)." He said
that the position would be filled
only with a black candidate.

Drake commented that there is
only one black faculty member,
Economics Professor Clifford
Reid, presently at Grinnell. There
were four last year.

“It‘s our priority and he
(Kissane) obviously has a dif-
ferent priority,” said Dean of the
Faculty Catherine Frazer. She
also said that the position has
always been filled by blacks,

Alice Deck, 3 black protessor
who left the school to take a posi-
tion at the University of Illinois,
formerly taught the course.

Kissane, after speaking off the
record with an 5&3 reporter,
decided to issue the following
statement:

“I'm Sorry that the matter of
my resignation as chairman of the
English Department has become
a topic in the 5&3. It involves a
difference of view between the ad-
ministration and me concerning
College policy regarding eligibilir

ty tor the position in Airo~
American literature. I do not
believe that qualified mm,
minority candidates for this posir
tion should, ipso tacto , be exclud
ed from consideration I think it
would serve no useful purpose for
me to make lurther public coma
ment at this time, except to say
that i think everyone involved in
this matter means well and that
I‘m not personally on the outs wim
anyone. We're all lucky to have
such an able new chair in
Elizabeth Dobbs.”

According to Drake, the ilap
Started when Frazer informed
Kissane that one of Kissane's
choices for the job would not be
acceptable because she is white
Drake later told Kissane the same
thing Frazer did.

The fact that a position is held
specitically for a minority appli-
cant could cause the school legal
problems if a rejected white appli»
cant decided to file a discriminas
tion suit against the college.
Drake, however, said, “We're
prepared to race (a suit). . . If we
end up in court, so be it."

Drake added that the college
emphasizes the appointment of
women and blacks to the faculty,
but there is a slim pool from which
to select applicants. Several
blacks have been added to the col-
lege payroll but not as iaculty
members,

Since department chairs tradi-
tionally have little power at Grin-
nell, Kissane's action will pro
bably have little effect beyond be
ing a symbolic gesture.

McGovern proves popular
in SOuth Lounge

by Ethan Cohen

Presidential candidate George
McGovern spoke to a very recepr
tive audience Monday afternoon
in the South Lounge of the college
Forum In an appearance marked
by the presence of numerous
Secret Service agents, police ofr
flcers and an over-flow crowd,
McGovern focused on the inter-
related issues of peace, foreign
policy and the military budget,

McGovern promised that his
first action, if elected president,
would be to end all us. military
actions in Central America, ins
cluding military aid to El
Salvador and the “Contra" groups
in Nicaragua.

Criticizing the Reagan ads
ministration's assertion that all of
the Central American ins

surgenices were caused by the

Soviet Union or Cuba, McGovern
declared, “It all the Russians and
Cubans were to disappear today,
we'd still have revolution in Cenr
tral America and insurgency in El
Salvador.”

McGovern blamed the
upheavals on what he termed die
“dismal standard ot living and the
oppressive regimes" that are now
common in Central America.
Stating his belief that revolution
in Central America is inevitable
under present conditions, the
tormer senator trom South
Dakota predicted that revolution
would spread to Guatemala.

McGovern was caretul to point
out that he did not believe that the
us. should endorse or finance
revolutions because of the ex-
cesses that often accompany
them. The proper role tor the U.S.,

Large grant sitting idle

by M. Wolfgang Schumann

Grinnell College recently
received a $275,000 grant from the
Mellon Foundation, but faculty
members are not quite sure yet
exactly what the college will do
with the money.

According to a press release
published by the Office of College
Relations,‘ the Foundation wishes
Grinnell to develop “fresh com-
binations in teaching and learning
that will serve to strengthen and
revitalize courses and programs
across all the arts and sciences."
This is the second grant of $275,000
awarded to Grinnell by the New
York-based Foundation.

The prus release also stated
that some of the money will be use
ed to augment the present
Tutorial program with six new
topics to be developed over a
period of five years. Faculty-
development seminars will also
be established in order to in!
troduce new interdisciplinary pro
grams in the humanities and
social sciences, such as Atro-
American studies, women‘s
studies, and crossscultural
studies, Senior seminars that will
cover broad interdisciplinary
topics are also planned.

Thus far, however, most of the
specitics have yet to be determin-
ed. The Afro-American Studia

-Committee, for example, had of-

tered three suggestions to Dean
Catherine Frazer well before the
Mellon grant was announced.

According to an intersofiice
memo lrom the committee to
Dean Frazer, these included re-
quests for funds for more Afro-
American drama, artwork, and
music- establishment of a black
artist-in-residence program; and
steppednlp recruitment of Afro-
American faculty, The memo in
addition recommended that 19x,
isting resources — especially
faculty members with experience
and interest in Africa 7 be pooled
to create “an exciting program
with materials at hand,”

“We never got an answer to this
memo, and you can see it's a little
old," said Randolph Roth, chair-
man of the committee. The memo
was dated February 7, 1933, The
urtist~inrresidence program has
gotten nowhere since then, and
still “we need more [permanent]
black faculty," he continued.

There has been, howcver. some
promotion of black culture in

already established programs.
Recently Sandy Moitett, a pro-
fessor of drama, has compiled a

collection of black dance and'

biography; and Music Frotessor
Ted Solis has directed a bladi
play and worked in Afroe
American music.

Another area in which the
Mellon money may be used is in
the Social Sciences division.
Chairman Jonathan Andelson has
said that his division is consider»
ing establishing courses dealing
with the social problems or the
twentieth century, and also
creating an integrated lower~level
Social Sciences course.

Andelson emphasized, though,
that those ideas are just that —
“not even proposals yet."
Andelson guessed that it will be a
few months betore any programs
are developed and implemented
with the Mellon grant. .

At this point, then, there are a
iew people with several ideas
about uses for the grant, but
nothing very specific has been
proposed Students and faculty
will have to wait unit] 1984785 for
the new programs to be unveiled.

George McGovem talks with Prof. Chambers and Owen Charles
in South Lounge last Monday. Phnlo by Peter Lydecker.

he said, is one of nonsintervention
and persuasion through example
to encourage democracy in the
region.

Quoting President Reagan as
saying, “We're not going to let
anyone shoot their way into
power,” McGovern urged the due
dience to remember the revolu-
tionary heritage of the United
States and rhetorically asked how
Reagan thought “George
Washington won our the
dependence for us, it was no Suns
day school picnic."

Asked by one student if he would
View a bloc of communist coun-
tries on the borders of Panama
and Mexico as a threat to the U.S.,
McGovern replied that he did not
view that circumstance as being
very likely and said he telt mat
the Soviet presence in the region
is overplayed. when again press-
ed as to the threat ofa communist
takeover in Honduras Dr Costa
Rica. McGovern quickly retorted,
“No one appointed us to be in
charge of other people's idelogy,"
evoking applause from the au
dience.

The presidential candidate also
favors an immediate withdrawal
of all U.s. forces from Lebanon.
when asked what policy the us,
should iollow arter the removal of
the Marines, McGovern said that
if Syria refuses to negotiate, the
U 5, should give tacit approval to
a permanent israeli presence in
Lebanon if Israel withdrew to the
25 mile mark or if the Gemayel
government collapses.

Said McGovern. "They’re (the
Marines) trying to rultill an ims
possible mission, it’s beyond their
competency and they're having no
eiiect whatsoever." He added,
"It's no accident that all/of the
Joint Chieis ot staff opposed this
mission." Asked what the im-
mediate result of withdrawing the
Marines would be, McGovern
replied, “The safety of 1500 of our
young men ”

The former senator said he
lavors a twenty to twenty-five per

cent reduction in the Deiense
budget. Quoting sources in the
Reagan administration, he said
that at least 20 percent ct die
military budget is misspent or
otherwise wasted.

McGovern said he would also
like to see the larger weapons
systems scrapped, including the
MX missile system and the Bel
Bomber. In addition, he expressed
his desire to freeze the future
emplacement and production or
nuclear weapons,

McGovern also directed a large
portion of his remarks toward the
subject of military spending, He
stressed the {act that he is the only
one of the eight candidates for die
Democratic nomination that sup-
ports a reduction in the Defense
Department budget.

McGovern said that he felt the
freeze should take place im-
mediately and Said that the U.S,
would not be threatened for
several years even if the Soviet
Union refused to negotiate.

After the speech, McGovern's
third district Coordinator in lowa,
Matt Hessberg, noted that close to
200 signatures of support werecol-
lected that afternoon.
