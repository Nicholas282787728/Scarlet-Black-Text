Panel discusses Rusher’s “narrow view’

b) Ellen Z. Piekalkicwicz

Grinnell's teaching stair oi the
Nuclear Arms Seminar responded
to William Rusher's comments of
last week by saying that Rusher.
“did not have a lot to say as a con»
servative or as a commentator on
the nuclear freeze."

Rusher. publisher of the Na»
tional Review, gave last week's
convocation.

History Professor Al Jones.
Political Science Professor
Wayne Moyer and Chemistry Pro
lessor Gene Wubbels spoke in
South Lounge Wednesday under

, the auspices of Grinnell’s Mortar
Board.

Moyer. responding to Rushers
statement that the nuclear freeze
is the left’s new candidate cause
- just as Vietnam was a said.
“the movement is not only
ideologically based. but draws
from both Sides of the political
spectrum,”

He added that the people he
knows who are involved in the
nuclear irecze are sincerely
dedicated and are ”extremely
concerned about the precarious
world situation.”

Moyer, in addition. disagreed
with Rusher's comments about

A the Triad. and especially the MX
missile. Moyer explained. “There
was the assumption in his speech
that the Soviets would be launr
ching a limited first strike, and
that then we would launch a
limited attack in response.
However, in times of crisis the
Soviets may not want to launch a
limited first strike. . . because
there exists too much chance that
\we will not see it as being a
limited strike and might launch a

‘massive.’ retalitcry attack on
them.”

He added. “This planning a
limited nuclear war is not the best
strategy."

Wubbels. expressing concern
that Rusher was not there to de-
fend himself. said Rusher's “in-
eptness. shaky information and
cheap shots" nevertheless warn
rant response.

Wubbels agreed with Meyer
that the Triad defense is not the
best strategy, because only 95 per
cent accuracy can be insured.
This leaves. he explained, 400
Soviet missiles —enough to wipe
out 2/: oi our industry.

In addition. Wubbels said the
MX missiles aimed at missile
sites instead of Soviet cites are
useless as a deterrent because no
Soviet missiles would be left in the
silos after their first strike.

Wuhbels also commented on
Rusher’s statement that the pro
duction of nuclear warheads is not
verifiablel “The fact production is
not veriliable is nothing new. . .
and none of the nuclear arms con-
trol treaties have included the
verifiable control of production.
but instead seek to control the
delivery of warheads, which is
verifiable.”

Mayer, speaking to President
Reagan's “Star Wars" defense
plan. which Rusher supported in
his convocation speech. said, “I
have doubts that it would
dramatically increase the cost oi
defense and we cannot be sure it
Wlll even work."

He added that it is highly pro-
bable ' the Soviets would
”counteract our defense system
by building more oiiensive
missiles at a much cheaper cost
than we would be paying to pro-
tect ourselves."

Wubbels asked. “Why would so

meone spend $50 million dollars
on this?"

Wubbels agreed with Rusher
that nuclear weapons have caused
a maturation oi the super
powers. He said “Nuclear
weapons have gotten the political
leadership to he more responsible
about war. .because any leader
oi a superpower'who begins a
nuclear war will be causing his
own death in less than 72 hours."

Wubhels warned, however, it is
“irresponsible for the leadership
to ignore arms control. "

Jones. who disagreed with
Rusher most emphatically. went
so far as to say, “I could make a
better conservative case than
Rusher did."

Jones said Rusher has a very
narrow View of the world because
Rusher simply sees the Soviet
Union as the ”atheistic focus in

the world which is in opposition to
theistic America

Jones added. “There is an odd
mixture oi politics and religion in
his thinking."

He said. “Rusher in his
dogmatism is closer to a
totalitarian outlook of the world
than the heirs of the enlightment. .

which. who in Rusher's opinion.
have convinced the people that
they do not need the “God
Package." "

Wubbels said Rusher‘s concepr
tion of the Soviet Union as the evil
empire creates the vulnerability
question, . , This has created a
desire in both sides to be
superior."

Wubbels added. “The nuclear
freeze gets us on a different track.
it stops the tendencies toward ab-
solute weapon systems. which
have polarized the world."

Coffee

House
ald
by Melissa Kagle

Joint Board members have
been hit just as hard with mid-
sems this week as the rest of us.so
this Wednesday's meeting was
unusually short. The items
discussed were the request to
class agents that they suggest to
alumni that donations go
specifically to the scholarship
fund. and the refusal to give $100
to Gail Fisher for a folk singer at
the coiiec house. mainly because
SGA did not want to fund a profit-
making organization.

The meeting opened with a
discussion about SGA'S request to
class agents Jon Scharff. SGA
President. reported on his
meeting with members oi the
development office and President
Drake. They suggest to Scharti
that SGA only makc this request
to class agents of the past tell
years because he ieli that classes
prior to '74 would not be as sym-
pathetic or be familiar about the
Cause.

Joint Board members objected
to this suggestion. vice President
Pete Hautzlnger mentioned that
classes after '74 would be the least
likely to donate money. thereby
greatly reducing the eiiect oi the
proposition. SGA will not be able
to contact any class agents the
college does not give them access
to because class agent addresses
are hard to find Joint Board in
structed Scharft' to meet again
with college officials to discuss
receiving all the class agent adv
dresses.

A resolution submitted by Main
Hall President Dave Mathias ask-
ing SGA to inform the student
body or their request to class
agents passed unanimously

The other business discussed
was the IFC allocation of $10 to
iund a iolk singer at the coiiee
house, Robbie Scaklor. SGA
Treasurer, argued. “We iSGAl
don’t give money to profitrrnaking
organizations so they can make
more money." Lind Davela, IFC
Chair, argued that the coffee
house is not much or a profit
organization. “They never made
any proiit this year until last Sun-

day when they made one dollar.”

she stated.

Joint Board deClded it was im-
proper ior SGA to iund a proiit
organization even one that is do
ing so badly. The Board passed a
resolution denying the money to
the coffee house if no Verbal or
written contract had been made
with the singer,

Joint Board also voted to turn
down the $50 Dan Klatz. Concerts
Chair, had allocated to the folks
inger event for the same reason,

Due to the immense confusion
about this allocation. Joint Board
instructed the Student Rules Com-
mittee to draw up clear guidelines
for the IFC

The IFC allocation was the only
new business discussed. The
meeting was adjourned less than
an hour aiter it began and
everyone went back to studying.
