And you wonder why Grinnell is
hosting a symposium entitled
"Sports and the National
Character."

By the time you will have
graduated someone will have paid
at toast to thousand dollars tor

'sil the bench?‘ is Steve Young or
any other athlete so valuable to
our society that he warrants being
paid what it takes ten workers liv»

Not only do the economics oi
Modern American Sports need to
be questioned but the relation
ships between sports and politics.
sports and national pride. and
spor's and the individual athletes
need to be examined.

It has never been made more
clear that America links its sports
to its political activity than when
former President Jimmy Carter
held U.S. athletes out of the 1980
Summer Olympic Games in order
to show the Soviets that we ‘meant
business' on the issue of
Aighanistan. As vain and
ridiculous as the jesture may have
been. what must be taken serious-
ly is that our culture produced at
least one politician who believed
that he could deploy athletes as he
could soldiers.

Carter. I dare to say. is not the
only product cl this new game. We
as a country tight a little war with
the world every iour years at the

Olympics when we hold our big
medal counts. Newscasters may
report bombings in Beruit, explor
sions in New Jersey and three
medals in the downhill all in the
same breath. We seem to think
that nonrAmerlcan athletes as
less deserving oi honor than
Americans

Two oi the topics oi discussion
during the symposium will he,
“The Olympics- Myth and Reali-
ty" and “Politicmng Sports:
Who. when. why," Hopeiully both
will include some good discussuon
oi this contusion oi games with
reality Maybe the question will
be raised as to why there need be
such partisonship in the Olympics
anyway.

The third topic of discussion will
be “Amateur and Professional:
Distinction without a—Dieterence '
This is a topic which I touched on
in a previous column. but it is lmr
portant to reinterate that it is
about time we as a nation stopped
' noring the tact that athletes
without money do not compete.

The wrongs and evils which ex-
ist within the world oi sports do
not signal the (all of the American
empire. but in so iar as sports
character can be an indicator 0i
national character. it is time that
these wrongs and evils be ad
dressed.

As liberal arts students. some oi
us will become the decision
makers oi the iuture. We all know
how old we Will be in the year 2000
it is just as important that we
think about these issues now. as it
is important that we concern

The Daves) claiming the league
championship. LSD iinished up
their season by defeating the Nads

meaningless.

Fans had eagerly awaited
Wednesday's LSDeNads
showdown throughout the second
half of the season as it had promis
ed to be a battle tor the top spot.
The contest lost all meaning,
however. following the Nads’ loss
on Tuesday to the Fecal People.
LSD, meanwhile, had no problem

delense of Burning Rectal Itch.

LSD’S only loss came in their
first outing when the flu caused
