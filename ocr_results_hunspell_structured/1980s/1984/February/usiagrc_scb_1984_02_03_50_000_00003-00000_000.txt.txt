have a good team until you have a

For the members of the Fellowship
of Christian Athletes (FCA). wlnning
Comes in many different forms
because for them the goal of athletic
competition is not simply to win. but
rather for the athlete to make the best
use of his/her abilities,

The Grinnel] Fellowship provides a
place where people can talk about
their experiences as athletes and as

Christians so that they can gain a ,

perspective on athletics which looks
beyond the tally on the scoreboard.
The FAG was formed thirty ymra
ago by athletes. coaches and ministers
who wanted to create an organization
to encourage athletes in express their
beliefs in the context of athletic com-
petition. Membera include such sports
figures as Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom
Landry and Los Angeles Laker
KareemrAbudl Jabbar.

As Andy Hamilton. one of the co-
founders of the Grinnell group ex-
plained, the members of the group do
not attempt to preach to their team.
males. Instead. they try to interest

others in Christianity by maintaining
a positive attitude about themselves
and their team whether or not they
are having a winning season.

in their view, this is the appropriam

’attitnde for someone who profesm

the Christian faith and who wishes to
give credit for his/her talents to God.

The group was started last semester
by three students: Hamilton, Lisa In-
genito and Scott Sumner, Lust
semester there were eleven members
representing at least six different
sports. Stauffer added that one need
not be a member of an intercouegiate
team to join the group. in addition or
weekly open discussion meetings the
group has had gettogcthers with the
high school FCA group to play
vaueybau or to wamh a movie,

Such activities are a way in which
the members or the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes develop their faith
as a source of inspiration and help
foster a positive spirit of cooperation
between town and college.
