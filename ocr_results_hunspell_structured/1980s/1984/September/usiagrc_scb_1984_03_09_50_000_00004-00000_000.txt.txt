Rolling back the campus apathy

It seems like it was just yesterday that student apathy
was the biggest problem this campus faced. However, the
turnout at last Monday’s Student Government Association
(SGA) Presidential Forum reflects the beginnings of a
new attitude on campus toward interest and involvement.

When the forum was organized, nobody had any idea
how large the turnout would be. The attendance was
rather substantial and the level of interest in the crowd
seemed reasonably high. Students came by to get an im-
pression of the six people, a high number not often seen in
recent elections, who want to become SGA president. All
this interest in a position challenged not long ago by cats
and puppets. Perhaps the voter turnout this Monday will
reflect this renewed involvement.

Students at Grinnell are showing definite signs of wan-
ting to know what is going on around them and how they
will be affected by certain actions. The large crowd in
South Lounge was just the latest example of this interest
in various matters, beginning with the curriculum discus-
sions and the Afro-American Literature position, the
Georgia Dentel situation and the many campus organiza-
tions, An editorial which ran here two weeks ago declared
the need for campus activism; we are currently realizing
the importance of such activism and seeing much more of

it at Grinnell.

Involvement extends beyond just student politics and
faculty/administration decisions. The recently-concluded
Black History Month activities helped to show the campus
many aspects of that part of the Grinnell community.
There has also been a rise in the number of interest groups
on campus and even the 5&8 has enjoyed a resurgence of
interest throughout the campus.

Curriculum process

by Jim Rabchiik
The iaculty has asked the Cure

richlum. Committee to fill in the ..

gaps oi knowledge the faculty had
about the real- life effects of the
Parslow Proposal. It also asked
the committee to seek other op-
tions to curricular reiorm apart
from the Parslow Proposal.
Peter Hautzinger, Robby
Sckalor. Wes Joe, and I are the
.student members of this commit-
tee and it has been our task to

represent the student interests in '

this present stage of development.
Most of our research locused on:

1. Alternatives and options to
the Parslow Proposal.

2. The staiiing implications
given the acceptance of the
Parslow Proposal.

The Curriculum Committee
presented the result of this
research to the faculty on
February 21, 1984, without a
speciﬁc recommendation ior ac
tion. The faculty took none and
has remained silent.

The Committee, however.
decided last Friday to conclude its
work by choosing to resubmit the
Parslow Proposal on April 2, with
the list of possible amendments,
to the faculty for debate. Along
with the Farslow proposal, we
will submit the Jones Proposal,
which is in uniinished iorm, and

ask the faculty to judge whether it
warrants the kind at research

which the committee performed .

for the Parslow Proposal.

How did we. as students, fit into
this process of research? Unfor-
tunately. not very well. This was a
result of both the nature of the
work and or our unpreparedness.
Now, however, our role is become
ing more defined. and it is becom-
ing easier to prepare ourselves for
the work ahead.

As the 'Eaculty struggles to
establish a set of priorities ior uie
purpose oi iocusing Grinnell’s
educational aims. it has become
clearer Hiat the task of restructur-
ing a curriculum is a humbling
one for everyone. The faculty has
not set vision of an ideal cur-
riculum. nor has it the organiza
tional experience to quickly bring
about such an ideal curriculum to
everyone's satisfaction.

We are all in the same boat:
faculty, students, even the Ad
ministration. in a very real sense,
noone is in charge. All we have
are our hopes and fears, our
guesses to guide us.

What this means in practical
terms is that all of us have a role
to play in the shaping oi Grinnell’s
curriculum if we are in the same
boat, that means our observations

Another gathering of candidates will take place this
Monday at 8 PM in South Lounge when the Vice-
Presidential hopefuls meet in their own forum. It will be
interesting to note how many people show up for this one.
While a smaller crowd won‘t mean there is widespread
apathy here, it would say a lot about the priorities of busy
students facing the pressures of mid-sem week.

The best thing mat can happen to indicate that there
really is involvement is a good turnout at the elections
early next week. By now most people have a good idea of
whom they want to vote for (and seniors can vote), Take a

as students in the Grinnell En-
vironment are not simply valid,
but vital to the current debate.

Whereas the faculty has the exs
perience oi dealing with a wide
variety or students and academic
environments, the students are
more directly aware oi the wtal
academic environment oi Grin-
nell. Whether we are statisfied or
dissatisfied with this environ-
ment, we are responsible for arr
ticulating our impressions and
giving a rationale ior them.

Talk about this with your
friends, and wiﬂi some of the
faculty, and with the Curriculum
Committee members. If your
comments are articulate, then
they will be influential in shaping
our academic environment.

This seems too simple. perhaps.

Don't count on ill We have
already seen the faculty‘s difficul-
ty in iocusing their debate on the
curriculum. It is unlikely that we
will be any different, Cherished
opinions are likely to he challeng-
ed, and we will often find
ourselves in the wrong. We should
be prepared. however, to exercise
the liberality of mind and heart
necessary to perceive the faculty
and administration as more ex,
perienced equals and to learn the
value of charting one's own course
in the world.

Students do have the right to
participate on an institutional
basis, as well as simply from opi»
nions. Perhaps the most Vital stu~
dent organizations concerning
this matter are the Student
Educational Policy Committees.
The SEPCs participate in the hlr»
ing and tenliring process oi facul-
ty. They can also iniluence the
structuring oi particular courses
as well as the structuring oi the
department as a whole.

They are your academic
representatives at this school, and
is through these committees

Your opinions concerning. the cur-
riculum oi Grinnell should be
directed to them.

To get the discussion rolling.
here is a thesis to defend or to at
tack.

Grinnell is undisciplined in the
manner in which it presents
material to its students, and it im-
parts to the students a similar
lack of discipline because of this

Does the whirlwind of events
and academic demands create
broadly educated and experienc-
ed students or does it rob them of
the focus and perspective
necessary to master that which is
presented to them? Are we too
spread out? What does your
answer mean in terms of cur-
rlcular policyl Does locus mean
requirements? Or can locus be
created on a more grassroots
level?

We don't need to find the right
answers, all we need are the possi-
ble ones. and the willingness to
choose with our eyes open. With
this accomplished, Grinnell Col-
lege can then truly claim to be a
liberal arts college

School

prayer
still
wrong

by John Sbarbaro

The Senate this week, as well as
the House oi Representatives, has
been addressing the issue oi
prayer in our public schools.

There are several amendments
on the Hill concerning this issue;
of these, two stand out as having a
good chance of passing: the
Reagan amendment and the
Becker amendment. The Reagan
amendment would allow the in»
dividual school boards the
freedom of deciding on religious
activities (i.e. school prayer). The
Becker amendment would set
aside a determined period of time
each day that would be devoted to
silent worship.

Surveys show that 30 percent oi
all Americans favor school
prayer. Although seemingly in-
nocuous, both amendments infra
inge upon personal liberty, as well
as contradict some fundamentals
of the US. Constitution. For these
reasons, school prayer should be
opposed

First, any amendment that
would allow a public institution to
mandate a religious activity, such
as prayer. questions the very
tenet upon which most oi our laws
are based; the most people
helped. while attempting not to
compromise the rights of the
minority.

As it stands now any child can
pray in school. As long as the stu-
dent does not disrupt the
classroom, she may pray before
school, after school, and even dur-
ing school if the teacher doesn't
think she is sleeping. Both propose
ed amendments, however, would
change this.

Reagan’s proposal would allow
some schools to have a mandatory
prayer, at a mandatory time.
while the Becker amendment
mandates a period of silence each
day

Second, both amendments are
at odds with the founding constitu-
tion principal of liberty. Whether
it‘s the Reagan amendment or the
Becker amendment, both pro-
posals encroach upon personal
ireedom, In fact, these proposals
appear to strike at the very heart
or what Reagan is trying so hard
to reduce, the reach of govern~
merit. Even if school prayer only
takes up 30 seconds oi every day,
it is a governmental infringement
that should not exist.

Third, school prayer amend-
ments come into direct conﬂict
with the first and the fourteenth
amendments. The First Amends
ment states that “Congress shall
make no law respecting an
establishment oi religion or pro
hibiting the free exercise thereof.

There is no question that
religion has been an influential
iorce in our country‘s past. But
religion has been able to play such
a role because it has been free
from the iniluence oi the govern
ment This separation will
hopefully continue, but only if
Americans realize that one child
has just as much right not to pray
in school, as another child has to
do so No one is asking that the
praying child love his none
religious neighbor. just respect
his (God given?) rights
