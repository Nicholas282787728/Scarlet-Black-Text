New faces at student affairs
Interviews with four new resident advisors

By Susan Frager

“I plan to do as much as I can. ..
and to grow as much as I can at
Grinnell." said Steve Jones, the
new Resident Adviser tR,A.), oi
ﬂames and James halls.

Jones, who holds undergraduate
degrees in sociology and
psychology, and an M.A. in
Guidance and Counseling from
Eastern Illinois University, has
had an interest in working with
college students since he was one.
He has worked as a student pro-
grammer, brought in iilms to
Eastern. and has been a member
of the National Association of
Campus Activities Since his CD}
lege days.

He has also conducted
workshops in leadership training
and was an intern’and then a tull~
time counselor at the Alcohol and
Drug Rehabilitation Center in
Charleston. 111. While working on
his M.A., Jones held an assistant-
ship at the Otfice or student Ac-
tivites at Eastern Illinois working
as an assistant adviser to the
fraternities and sororities, the
minority students, and the pro
gramming board that planned
campus events.

Jones found out about Grinnell
at a job placement exchange in
Wisconsin. Then, he said, “I came
to an interview, and I fell in love
with the campus.” His idea about
the role of an RA. at Grinnell is
“to be here for the students when
they need me, to help them in any
way I can.“

Barbara Krantz, R A. [or Norris
and Cowles halls, agrees. “One of
my main roles, I think, is to help
students in any way find Grinnell
to be a positive experience,"
Krantz said. She did her
undergraduate work at Iowa
State, where she heard 01' Grinnell
as a school with “a very good
academic reputation." Krantz
majored in psychology and went
onto the University of Nebraska
graduate school [or her M A. At
Nebraska, she became interested
in working with college students,
Grinnell is her first [ullctlme job.

Krantz was attracted to Gnnr
nell, as were other new R.A.s,
Denise Collins and Mike ’I‘esSier,
because oi its freedom. Krantz put
it this way: “I liked the fact that
there would be a minimum of
rules and regulations that I need
to enforce. [don’t like having to be
a disciplinarian or a policeman
Grinnell's position was much
more oi a counselingrlike position
than at many other schools." .

Collins Said, “I like the fact that
it's not all completely, structured.
. . there’s a lot oi freedom and a lot

oi choice." She has worked exten
sively at the University at
Maryland, where she obtained her
MA. in College Student Person
nel. As a student at Maryland,
Collins was an an. tthe
equivalent or an sit. at Grinnell)
at Maryland’s Department oi
Resident Liie, worked in the
Orientation Oiiice, and “did
academic advising tor lreshmen
who were undecided about ma-
iors." While workine on her

Most Grinnellians who crossed
the state line in August on their
way back to school saw the sign.
“Iowa e A Place to Grow". On
her way from Detroit, Lynette
Findley. the new Associate Dean
oi Student Affairs. saw it too.

“Grinnell is a place to grow and
a lot oi that growth takes place m
the residence halls,” Findley said

She received a an. in Special
Education and an M.A. in
Guidance Counseling trom the
University oi Michigan, Aiter
graduation, Findley worked as the
director oi residential education
at an Alrican Methodist Episcopal
Church aiiiliated school in ohio.
After three years at the school,
Findley returned to Michigan ior
iive years at Michigan State
University as an an, in a hall
with 1,200 students, During that
time she earned a PhD. in Higher
Education Administration,

Findley stresed the point that
Grinnell doesn’t have dorms.

“Dorms are a place where you
eat and sleep and nothing more
Residence halls are where you
learn and grow." The term ‘cotr
tage' on the residence hall signs
eniorces Findley’s opinion.

“The terminology is so impor-
tant. Grinnell is such a highly
academic and demanding enr
vironment that the students need
to be able to relax in a residencc
hall (not dorml environment."

Another idea Findley emphasiz-
ed was the students needs ior
social growth.

“Residence iialis play an impor-
tant role in their [the students'l

courses to get into the university's
engineering school, Her second
assistantship was at the Universir
ty oi Maryland’s Relationships
Skills Program. This consisted of
communicationskills workshops
[or small groups, mostly or
freshmen. “Grinnell," she said.
“is my first tullctime job." Collins
is the RA. for Cleveland and Main
halls. She said, ”I really like it
here a lot. It's such a different en
vironment.”

Tessier, the RA. for Clark, Dibr
ble and Rawson halls. commented
on Grinnell's philosophy. He said.
”I think I can sum it up by saying
that there's a Concept mat I really
believe in and that's self-
determinism. Everybody at some
point in his liie has to take control
of their llle rather than having

growth. This is why the S.A.s need
to produce a community at
mosphere on the iloors."

Findley works directly with the
seven RAS and indirectly with
the S.A.s. She is anxious to work
with her staii. seeing her job as a
chance ior personal development.
She would like to see the R A. stail
grow too. . .Just like the sign
says," she smiled.

Findley has also iormulated
programs dealing with time
management. stress manage-
ment. and the improvement of
study skills,

Findley summed up: “I don’t
want to just otter programs. I
want to oiier programs based on
Student need and interest so that
there will be greater participa-
tion. Grinnell is a place where
people grow and the residence
halls play an integral part in that
growth."

Tessier lett Colorado [or the

lege Student Personnel at Western

“I like the small school at
mosphere a lot better, It’s incredi-
ble, all the iacxlitles that are here
for this number of students, . , I
don't see the students as being a
‘number' at all,"

All the R.A.s admitted that.
though they don't know what the
Iuture Will bring for them, they
are really impressed with Grin
hell and the way it works. Jones
remarked. “i'ni learning how to
do a lot 01 different things at Grins

me."
