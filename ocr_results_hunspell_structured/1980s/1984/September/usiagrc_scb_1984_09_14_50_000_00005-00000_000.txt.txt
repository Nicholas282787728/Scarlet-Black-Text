Letters to the Editor — Conservatives Blast ‘McNamarism’

To the Editor.

l could not believe my eyes
when I read Nicholas
McNamara's tract in the last
5&3 McNamara, in decrying
what he calls ”McCarthyism”,
has employed one oi its most suc-
cessful tactics. namely the
“multiple untrutli" where thc
perpetrator hurls ioi-th such a
plethora oi untested assumptions.
ignorant accusations. and
deplorable aspersions that one (he
hopes) will be stunned into silence
by the ensuing deluge oi
ideological bilge. This sort oi
thing should not go unchallenged,
hence, this letter.

Mr. McNamara writes as one
whose Manichcan world-view of
Liberal Goodauys vs. Fascist
John Birchites has been exploded
by recent events and, unable to
come to grips with the complex»
ities of modern America. has
sought reiuge under the first piece
of leftist ideological rubble he can
find. It would take months to
unravel McNamara's twisted,
dilettantish excursion through the
Olympics, movie criticism, the
just war theory, WWII. etc, Thusi
shall draw attention to that part oi
his writing which deserves the
most Criticism — and the most
fear. I refer to Mr, McNamara’s
McCarthyism. or should I say his
”McNamaraism"?

McNamaraism has much in
common with its right-wing twin.
not the least of which being near
hysterical warnings against a cone
spiracy to brainwash America.
ABC. called the “Ministry of
Truth" cultivates “redrwhiterand-
blue babies" “in the style of Goeb-
bels" by using the.olympics as a
propaganda “tool”. NBC per-
suades ”millions, . . that the use of
nuclear weapons is not such a bad
thing” through its “instrument (or
jingoistic propaganda". the TV
movie “Enola Gay". MGM adds
to the cabal its message oi Jihad
against the USSR 7 the film “Red
Dawn” Of course. McNamara
will not elaborate on the cons
spiracy «reminds one of McCain
thy and his "fists". doesn‘t itil.
Perhaps he Just [eels that the
media is pandering to our darker
instincts. But he never hints that
this might be his position. and the
descriptions or the media given in
his article indicate that the
former conclusion is valid.

Like McCarthy. McNamara
directs his hatred at a philosophy
embodied by an identifiable group
7 Young Republicans and Gone
servatives. They. or more ace
curatcly. the philosophy they ein-
body. are seen by McNamara as.
to quote one ideologue. “The
source of evil in the modern
world." In two consecutive
paragraphs McNamara identities
Young Republicans and Conserr
vatives as the epitome oi all he
hates. the symbol oi the vague
cabal oi “blustering. bouncing
jingbism”, hatred and racism
glorified by the media. Young
Republicans and Conservatives
are not behind McNamara's con»
spiracy, but we are certainly the
highest expression and chief
beneficiaries of ”this heelhound,
this viper, this devil incarnate"
that McNamara calls the “legacy
olchCarthy". According to him.
we desire WWIII. an Orwellian
state full of “communismrhating.
warrloving soldiers" and fan-
tasize about planting the ilag on
top of the Charred casualties of a
nuclear war!

As a Young liepublican and
Conservative, I find this illiberal
and far from Grinnell at its
enlightened best. Surely no one
can believe McNamara's pore
trayal oi us? Don't we eat at
Cowles and Quad like non-

conservatives, room with none
Conservatives, and fear nuclear
war (or ally wart like none
conservatives" To paraphrase
Shakespeare: ”If you ticklc us. do
we not laugh? II you prick us, do
we not bleed“ We may disagree
on methods. but i and the presir
dent ol Freeze and Disarm are
united in our goal ol preserving
peace. and i think that counts for
something. Surely it counts
enough to show McNamara's pore
trayal of us as “Yankee Doodle
Wimps" who yearn ior ”those
halycon days when everyone
hated the Russians", “honor some
oi the lowest periods oi our
history”. and regard nuclear
holocaust callously as the shallow
indulgence in unthinking. McCar-
thyistiC hatred that it is,

If McNamara had expressed his
concern over America‘s renass
cent national pride. and chastened
us to temper our patriotism with
the humility that comes from
knowing that no nation is Without
great sins. i would have liked to
congratulate him on a job well
done. Instead, he has sounded the
cry of dark and anguished hatred
against those who are no less well-
meaning than himseli, turned us
into his Great Satan“, an
us With no. more ci
evidence than another zealot
some thirty years ago.
McNamara has at least taught us
a valuable lesson; that rabid left
wing hatred and rabid right-wing
hatred are but two sides of the
same coin. - lnn McLean

‘Demagoguery’
To the Editor:

A line by line attack of Nicholas
McNamara's “My God. >What
Have We Done?" in last week's
S518 is a monumental task which I
will not undertake. I am content
that its blatant demagoguery is its
own condemnation. Certainly.
”gritting its chauvlnist teelh.
showing its racist claws.
breathing its jingoistic tire" is as
dismterested and liberal a
description oi McCarthyism as
one can expect from a campus
where it is better to be a Com-
munist than a Bircher,

There are a few observations,
however. I would like to make
about McNamara's tirade against
the mass media. Conservatives
have protested ior years that the
media is a liberaledominaled
iield. McNamara is appalled. not
at a rcsurgc or McCarthyism. but
that a iew. a very ieiv, conser-
vative themes have trickled onto
television and the movies God
forbid our youth be corrupted by
patriotism, valor, and football. I
have not seen "Red Dawn" but I
know guerrilla wariare against a
Communist invasion is not a new
idea. this is merely ils first ap-
pearance in a society supposedly
open to all ideas and viewpoints

“Call to Glory". from that
Virulently reactionary and iascist
network that brought us the
hallmark of conservative doc-
trine, “The Day After", is the first
TV show in years to depict a
patriotic, brave military officer
who plays by the book. Other
prime time shows have delighted
in ridiculing the military or
iocussing on heroes who buck the
system, i.e.. the system is bad and
should be bucked.

Once McNamara determined
that Kennedy was wrong to defend
America in the Cuban Missile
Crisis. he tells us Truman was
wrong to drop the atomic bomb.
What he does not tell us, however.
is the number oi lives perhaps
saved by that decision. In View of

Japancse determination to con-
tiliue the war zit \vlialever cost. a
conventional iiivastoli of the
islands would have meant
thousands. hundreds of
thousands. oi lives both Japanese
and American. ll seems likely
that the decision has made. at
least in port. in the beliei that a
quick. albeit bloody. victory was
better than a prolonged and
bloodier one.

As ior the Olympics, far irom
revelling in the triumph oi
American athletes. Commen-
tators were quick to remind us
that the presence or Russian and
East German athletes would have
greatly lessened the number oi
medals we Won. Nobody will deny
the skill and strength V nor the
popularity in America 7 or the
Romanian and Chinese gymnasts
In every sports event, one is
allowed to cheer for the home
team, yet the cheers in Los
Angeles were not only ior the
American athletes but ior every
team that entered the stadium; it
was truly an international com-
petition.

Before we “go to the worldmnd
ask forgiveness for the crimes of
our nation." I believe we should
experience how the other half

lives 7 so that,we may know to‘

whom we humble and abase
ourselves, irom whom we seek abs
solution. Perhaps on May Day.
when the Russians celebrate. we
should celebrate also. According
ly, we can plant bombs in Mac
Field to blow on the limbs oi pass
ing students, as the Soviets do to
the civilians in Aighanistan. We
can exile an esteemed Physics

proiessor. preierably an elderly,

and ill one. to house arrest in some
desolate spot. although Iowa‘s
most desolate spots are pallid
quarters indeed compared to
Russia's. And we can shoot down
passing civiliali airliners that
threaten the airspace over Grin-
nell College. When America
reaches those depths oi barbarity.
we should indeed seek thc
iorgiveness. not oi our enemies
nor our allies, but of God, 7

Those who use or espouse the use
of them do not have in mind the iii~

To the Editor:

in the September 7th issue oi the
Scarlet and Black. Nicholas
McNamara has warned us oi a
vile apparition One that. he would
have us believe, is last closing in
on us. We are iaceu. he tells us.
with the return to McCarthyism.

instantly, irightening images
are brought to the treat at our
mind. We see blacklists. We see
politicians airaid to take a stand,
fearing they'll be thought oi as
pro»Communist There are con
gressional hearings where innor
cent people are persecuted and
humiliated, Careers are ruined,
tainilies torn apart. A country in
turmoil.

Troubling thoughts indeed, but
surely he would not put them in
iront or us without the evidence to
back it up. And, indeed, let us exs
amine the evidence which he has
brought forth.

His iirst piece or evidence is the
movie. now in release, called Red
liaviii. Here he displays a classic
example oi overkill. digging much
too deeply ior something that is
not there Red linuii is a war

movie. it presents us with a con- -

that of bad guys vs good guys
The bad guys have all the advan-
tages ipuwer. experience, etc.)
but one. the good guys aren't calls
ed the good guys ior nothing (Jone
sequently. the good guys over
come every adversity and win
their battle with the evil foe. This
is not a new phenomenon It was
developed by some or the great
writers of history long beiore the
movie industry had ever been
dreamed of, Little did you know
that when Alan Ladd, in Shane.
was having a shoot-out with the
enemy he wasn't simply saving
his friend from the evil neighbor.
what was really happening was
that the little boy.peering irom
under the doorway was being in-
doctrinated into the evils of Mc-
Carthyism.

Then we have the olympics. A
chance for most of the nations of
the world to come together and
compete in athletics A chance ior
small Countries to have some
small triumph over their larger
neighbors. A chance ior all the
people oi the world to take pride in
the athletic prowess of their fellow
countrymen. And a chance ior the
host country to turn their best side
forward and parade it in iront oi
the rest of the world. It is a simple
fact that most people like to take
pride in their surroundings. It can
be a iamily having a housewarm~
ing after they've had their home
remodeled or it can be the mama
that overtakes a small town as the
local high school basketball team
advances to and captures the
state Championship. or it can be a
country hosting the Olympics. ii
McNamara thinks this is one of
the roots of .McCarthyism.
perhaps he needs to be introduced
to the word patriotism.

The last two examples he
presents us with are two movies.
Call to Glory and Ellula Gay. both
of which I missed. However, in his
discussion oi Call to Glory which
aired on ABC, he says: "Is this
what we want to teach our
childrenl Are these the aspects oi
American Culture which we Want
to share? Are these the values of
the mass public which watches
pi'lmertlme TV?" At yet another
point he raises the question oi
whether ABC would now be deems
ed the Ministry of Truth.

Perhaps he iorgets that this is
the same network which
presented us with the movie The
Day Alter, hardly a movie that
glamorized nuclear war. Perhaps
he is too naive to realize that it
was the same mass public which

sat through both trail to Lilory and
The iluy Aitcr.

In his discussion 0: iiiioia (in)
he says:

“Clearly Enola (in; has not
produced to be entertaining or
historically accurate, but simply
to persuade millions oi viewcrs
that the use of nuclear weapons Is
not such a bad thing."

i will not argue the historical ac.
curacy of it. however i severely
doubt that this movie would be
capable oi persuading ”millions
of viewers" that nuclear war was
acceptable. The American public
is just not that naive,

Maybe, instead oi tearing it
return to McCarthyism, we should
instead examine the kind of
paranoia that would make people
dig so hard for evidence that
simply does not exist. That would
seem. to me, to be a much more
dangerous thing. 7 Kenneth d

Edior's Note: lnvo ing
”patriotism" as a requirement ior
all and a prerequisite to in-
telligent thinking is a serious
mistake.

‘frresponsible ,
T0 the Editor: raving

Nicholas McNamara paints an
interesting. if strident and over-
wrought portrait of the American
political climate. Considering that
his source materials consist of a
BMovie synopsis and two televi-
sicn preVlews, he might be over-
reaching. it he would have
bothered to watch all of the first
installment or “Call to Glory”; h'e
might have realized that more
than anything else, it was an at
tempt to portray the members oi
the armed iorces and their
families as human beings 7 more
than he is evidently willing to do.
Further, the U-2 flights in ques»
tion were over Cuba, not the
Soviet Union; they were perhaps
more inspired by a certain
understandable concern over the
placement of missiles 90 miles off
the Florida coast than "Bouncing.
boasting. blusterlng jingoism".

I‘m in general agreement with
McNamara's opinions. but this is
a poor time for such irresponsible
raving. At a time when liberal
thought on campus is being
challenged by increasingly vocal
and articulate conservatives. it is
essential that we maintain higher
intellectual standards. —-

Playing the two-party game

To the Editor;

Wowl A newspaper with opi-
nionsl Fine issue, guys. and cons
gratulations on your decision not
to shy away irom the “controverr
sial". However, your editorial on
the Presidential race neglects an
important point Although I am an
ultra-liberal who finds Reagan un-
conscionable and Mondale’s posi~
tions only a milder iorm oi the un-
thinking expansionism that has
been the U.S.'s voice in the world
for much of its history. I‘m doing
everything I can think ill to see
that Mondale is elected in
November Why? We, the college
students, made a big mistake in
1980.

Aiming to express our disgust
with the system as it was tthe
”lesser oi two evils” proposition.
much as it is nowt, many voted ior
John Anderson. thereby helping
give the election to Reagan.
Destite what seemed an over»

whelming victory ior Reagan. ho
was NOT given the mandate irom
the people as he would have you
believe. In Maine, for example.
there was no county in which
Reagan won by more than 374 per
cent and none in which Anderson
got less than 5 percent. In other
words. voting ior a third can»
didate in an iffy area can
significantly change the results.

So let muse of us who wish to
live to sec grandchildren. equaliv
ty, health and a reasonable world
order play the tworparty game,
and not give up our eiiorts alter
Mondale is elected. The ”lesser of
two evils” approach may get us
farther in the end President
Reagan has shown hiinseli
unreceptive to and ignorant oi the
needs of his constituency. which
is, in fact. the world, Let’s give
Mondale a chance, Peace. Ellen
