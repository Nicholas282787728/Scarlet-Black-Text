Blowing-off: A Grinnell tradition

With the end of New Student Days and the appearance
of many old faces, the Grinnell Migration of 1984 comes to
a close. Back from a hard summer of “real-world” work,
we prepare for 4 months of hibernation in the not-sorreal
world of Burling Library.

Not all stay in hibernation, however. In fact many of us
may still find the time to wander out of Burling and head
towards Danish Maid Bakery or the “Forum Beach", or
even to good ol’ Dickies Prairie Home. These are just a
few of the Grinnell rituals that make life between hibera-
tion periods a little more enjoyable.

Other prime events for those “blowing—off" are the
ever present Spring and Summer Ultimate Frisbee
games on Central campus, visits to the REC. (pronounc-
ed “PECK"), and GORP ventures through fields, forests,
and rivers.

The good and bad

With over 420 Freshmen and transfers added to the
enrollment statistics this semester, the Admissions
department is overjoyed. The administration boasts that
this has been a banner year in new student recruitment,
and that this is one of the brightest freshman classes in
decades As far as college policy would have it, the houss
ing sitution seems optimal. However, the freshmen living
in pit lounges and storage rooms and the upperclassmen
given surprise guests describe it as less than that.

Where blame might lay for the unexpected over~
crowding is unimportant at this point. What is important
is that the situation of “storage room occupancy" is
quickly alleviated

There are indeed benefits to having a full (but not
overﬂowing) enrollment: budget increases, increased

Of course the most established method of blowing—off is
to hit happy hour at the Pub, but many venture into the
Bar, the Longhorn and JD’s, while only the truly fearless
satlray farther to mingle in Link’s, Duffy’s, and Semoor’s

ace.

Roaming through corn fields, going to Friday Night
Blues and Rockabilly dances, playing games on Skip
Day, hanging out in the forum (pretending to study), get-
ting coffee for a nickel at Cunningham’s, and crusing
through all-campus parties: These are the stuff that the
Grinnell Tradition ismade of...

In the coming four months there’ll be plenty of
academic ventures and academic pressures to keep us
busy, and this is the most essential “stuff" of the Grinnell
Tradition, but let us not forget to come out of Burling once
in a while to marvel at the wonders of the long Iowa
horizon and blow-off just a little.

of overcrowding

off~campus quotas for upperclassmen and less budget
skimping. However, the attrition rate of 20-30 students exs
pected by the administration should lower enrollment to
the truly optimal (and a great deal more liveable) total of
1200. As soon as the population does start lessening, Stu-
dent Housing expects to start relocating those placed in
less-thanoptimal locations.

Ironically, we must hope and wait for the expected at-

trition rate to follow through. For certainly $10,000 is a bit

too much to pay to live in a storage room for a whole year.

So we shall give it a few more weeks and hope that the
problem relieves itself. Those among us in unfortunate
situations must learn to cope, but life in Grinnell goes on,
and soon all students can commend the Admissions
department on the fine job they have done.

Opinion
‘Ya Got Me’

by Jeff Raymond

One of the most difficult things
for a legislator to do is vote
against an emutiondaden bill that
has the wide support of respected
people. Unfortunately. the latest
of these bills was whisked through
Congress and Signed by President
Ronald Reagan last summer and
now, as a result. all 50 states Wlll
be forced to adopt the 21 year—old
drinking age limit or lose a
substantial portion of their federal
highway money.

Cutting down on drunk-driving
deaths and injuries is one of the
more noble undertakings that our
government can involve inlself in.
but careful analysis of thc situa»
tion reveals some faults in the
logic.

I grew up in the state oi
Missouri. one or many states that
has ior a long time se| 21 as lhe
"magic number" by which
minors become responsible
enough to handle drinking. In
theory. nobody under this age can
buy or have alcohol bought {or
them, That would mean. in
lheory. that mlnorswill not he get-
tlng drunk and driving their cars
dangerously.

Reality, though. is very dil-
ferent from theory. I have per-
sonally seen too many high school
kids get stinking drunk and still
mangage to get their cars on the
road,

A minor does not have to cross
state lines to find more relaxed
drinking age laws to get drunk. in
fact. it becomes a popular game
among minors to lind the bars and
stores that will sell alcohol
without making an ID check, And.
as we all know. making or buying
fake IDS in case one gets asked for
prooi of age is a big high school
activity. tDare 1 call it a
business?)

Passing a new law will most
likely not stop minors irom drivr
ing drunk. it you are lrom a state
that already has the 21 ycarold
age limit. you know how easy it is
for a minor to nevertheless obtain
alcohol

Drunken driving among minors
can be reduced by, for one thing.
m ore strict enforcement of the ex-
isting laws It is certainly dlfficult
tor the law police on the roads to
catch more than a small percens
tage of olienders. but more harsh
punishment of young drunks land
the adults who provide them with
the alcoholi is a good place to
start, Another solution might be
tightening up the standards (or obs
tainlng a driver's license. thus
reducmg onesllalf of the drunk
driving problem.

It‘s too bad that so many of our
lawmakers apparently didn't Cons
sider the problem more carefully
before deciding to treat lhis
disease with such ineffective
medication
