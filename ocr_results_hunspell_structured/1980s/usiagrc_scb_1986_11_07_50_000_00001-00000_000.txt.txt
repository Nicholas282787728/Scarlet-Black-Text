Zirkle had had no related problems prior
to the time of death

The Zirkles were sharing a joint con»
tract. meaning that each was teaching
three of the six classes normally taught by
tullrtime professors. In the case ol the
death or one party to such a contract. the
other takes over the additional classes.
Mrs. Zirkle has added Mr. Zirkle's classes
to her schedule. with the exception of one
design class which conflicts with her cur
rent schedule. That class is being taught
by Karin Connelly. Connelly will continue
working in the writing lab part-time.

The Zirkles taught courses in design.

Faculty to Vote on
New Admission
Pohcy

by Dave Jones

A policy for admission to Grinnell Coir
lege was proposed at the Faculty Meeting
November 3. “lGrinnell] is moving from a
selective mode of admission to a comr
petitive mode.” says John Hopkins. Direc-
tor of Admission

This competitive mode of admission has
been brought about by the increase in the
number oi applications to the college in re-
cent years, Waldo Walker. chairman of the
Admission and Student Financial Aid
Committee. sees the increase in applica-
tions as presenting the college with an en
viable opportunity.

“We find ourselves in the very
desirable position oi iinally having a large
enough applicant pool that we are able to
consider possrbtlities and options in our ad»
mission process." Walker said.

Also. with that increase in applications.
the Admission Board is faced With a pro
blem under the existing procedure. At the
moment. the Admission Board. which con»
slsls of three faculty members and the
Director of Admissions. is sent a segment
or the applications as determiend by a sore
ling procedure. Then. all applications that
exceed a certain set of standards are con-
sidered by the Director of Admissions and
the admissions staii. All applicants ialling
below those standards are sent to the Ad-
mission Board Ior consideration.

“Up until now we've had a channeling

device, we've had actually no instruction
from the faculty as to what criteria to use
to make selections.” Robert Grey, senior
member of the Admissions Board said.

The opinion of the Admissions Board is
that since they cannot personally handle
the increasing number or applications that
will be sent to them. a policy oi some kind
dictating automatic admissions. and
automatic rejections is needed, According
to Grey this will allow the Board to concenr
trate on the middle area oi applicants. He
went on to say that the new policy would be
"very experimental.” The Board would
see how eiiective the policy is in the up
coming year and then return to the faculty
with suggestions ior possible restructuring
ii necessary.

The proposal made by the Admissions
and Student Financial Aid Committee sug»
gests that criteria for admission be ranked
in a pre-designed order at importance. The
most important criterion would be the pro-
spective student’s periormance in secon-
dary school or in college in the case of a
transfer student. Following this would bea
