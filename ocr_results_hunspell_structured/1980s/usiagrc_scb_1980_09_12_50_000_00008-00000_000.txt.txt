IN FOCUS

Student A. ”My first Jomt was at a
concert. i remember taking it and
thinking. ‘Oli my God. am Icorruptl' I
really liked the leeling. Here. offering a
joint is like oiiering a beer. I think it's
really scary though when people smoke
by themselves. They're depressed and
have to smoke to get themselves out DI
their mood. It’s the same with a drink-
ing problem , . . that's Sad."

Student B. “Pot is a very social thing.
To smoke is like a ritual. When you‘re
high. you sit around and talk about deep
things. You don’t get rowdy, like with
alcohol.”

Student C. "It makes me feel good. I
‘ can escape reality. il I get pissed on or
bummed or worried. it something's
getting at me, I get high and it doesn't
bother me as much, Some people do it
because of peer pressure. some to
escape. like me . . . but that's not bad. I
think that's normal, just so you're not
escaping reality all the time."

Whether it’s to feel good. to relax, or
to escape. many Grinnell student
smoke pot and will continue. Though
the eltects are not quite the same,
smoking has become what drinking has
always been on college campuses: a
social activity. Grinnellians smoke in a
variety at places. lrom outside the Pub
[0 inside the Library. I talked with
three Grinnell students, each with dif-
ferent “drug habim." all having smok-
ed before coming to Grinnell. and all
considering themselves Iairly serious
about their school work.

I wanted to know why these students
smoked; was it academic pressure.
peer pressure? 1 was curious as to how
irequently these three smoked pot and
when they smoked. But more impor-
tantly. I wanted to prove a theory; that
it one were to yell out “Bangs! " at any

given moment on campus. you Would
indeed have a crowd.

The three students I interviewed do
not represent all Grinnellians. by any
means. I selected one who Smokes
periodically. who we'll call Student A.
another students who smokes more free
quently (Student El. and yet another
who. in their own words. “smokes pot
as regularly as cigarettes," istudent
Cl. ‘

No broad generalizations should be
made irom ths small cross section con»
cerning the drug habits at Grinnell Col-
lege. but talking With these students
may offer some clarification why peo-
ple at Grinnell use drugs and what el-
tect it has had on their litestyles.

Pot habits, like study habits. vary at
Grinnell. Some. like Student A. smoke
once a month. others. like Student B.
smoke every day and then all night on
the weekends. still others may have
habits like Student (1. who states. “Let's
put it this way, there are two weeks in
the year that I don't get high."

Supporting a habit may be hard on a
budget. but all three studets appear to
have dealt with the problem. Student A
spends, at most. 820 every two years
and Student B spends about $100 or
more (this sum includes other drugsi
per semester They both use money
trom summer jobs to pay tor the pot.
Student C stated. "A lot 01 times people
give me stull, but mostly I buy a lot at
one time and then sell some to my
friends. so i get whatever i get im-
free!"

Many people think that pot leads to
other drugs like coke. speed.
quaaludes. mushrooms, LSD. and
many people do go on to harder
substances as the next step in drug exr
perimentatinn, oftentimes it's not pot,
but other influences that steer the stu
dent towards these other drugs. Student
A admittedly lakes speed during finals
week. [or two to three weeks at a time.
Student 0. who take speed approx
imately {our times a week on a regular
basis. stated that this habit was pro
bably too lrequent. L‘ iurther stated that

he “experiments" With LSD about six
times a year He explained that he used
LSD a limited number at times because
he enjoyed the experience but also
realized the possible Chemical etlects it
could have on his body. “Pot is a weak
drug. LSD is a mlndaltcring ex»
perience." said c.

Drugs are accessable lor all three
Students. Student C stated that. at the
moment. it was dllttcult to Obtain pot
because the campus was. as he stated.
“dry." meaning that the amount oi pot
on campus was small, Student A said
that it was easiest to get any drug
around linals time because the demand
is higher. Student is stated, "A lot ol
people come back With drugs lrom
vacation or there Will be a shipment
irom MIT [where students make and
sell drugs. also delivering to various
"connections" al other college cam»
pusesl in the middle 01 the year. It
depends,"

A general myth al Grinnell prevails
that South Campus people and even
more Oil-Campus students smoke pol
and "do" more drugs than the North
Campus folks. Students A, B and C
tended to agree, to some extent. iiith
this myth. All three agreed that ii really
didn't matter where you lived. on or on
campus, out that. as B states. "it's all
in who you kiinii: Nevertheless.
smokers. as well as drugs are easll)
lound. but as A states, "I think South
Campus people smoke more. it‘s got
that reputation with Read. Loose and
the Pub. it‘s the purty campus"

So you can get the pot easily enough
and you even have Ll room \HtlI a decent
stereo to smoke It in. but “ill! lhal
schedule ol your. when do you smoke
it? Student A concluded. "It s the same
to me as drinking beer. II I were to get
high more olten, I'd arrange iiiy lime so
that I‘d dull allersludylng “

student (1 said that Gi-iiinell stopped
students irom over-doing their pot-
smoking. "ll luant to get good grades.
I can't smoke as much. 1 don‘t get high
belore l have to do niiyth like
thinking." said C But thei'L re other
