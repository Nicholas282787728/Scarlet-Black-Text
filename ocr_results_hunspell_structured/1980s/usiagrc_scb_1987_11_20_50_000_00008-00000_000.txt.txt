X-C Finished Best Season Ever

by Grant Ehrlich

Just last Saturday, Wartourg
College hosted the regional cross-
country meet at Waverly. iowa
Our team. riding high alter a great
victory deiending their conierence
title, went to Waverly determined
to create an upset.

They ran well and they ran
strong, stronger than any previous
Grinnell team, but the upset did
not come. in tact. the meet held
many surprises ior everyone who
attended For example, Loras. a
team predicted by many to win the
meet and do well at nationals, did
not even place in the top three;
they thus will not attend nationals,
instead. St. Thomas. St Johns, and
Luther took the top three spots.
Our own team iinished seventh out
oi a hold oi 16 teams attending, re-
taining their position as one oi the
best teams ln’the nation. but not
earning one ot the three spots to
nationals it gives them something
to strive ior next year. a goal that
they will achieve. given their
record oi improvement.

What does this mean for Grins
nell’! Believe it or not. we now have
a recognized nationalrcaliber team
— not one that just receives votes
every now and then, but one that is
consistently among the top 20 oi
the nation, The team has its lront
runner, Greg Evans, but more imr
portantly, it has the depth to back
him up. This year. much oi that
depth came irom ireshmen David
Hammond. Mark Couch. and Todd
Ruwenkamp were regulars among
the top seven. The veterans
leading them included sophomore
Nick Hopley. known ior his weightr
liiting, and juniors Geoii Hoops
and Ivan Lorkovic. Jeri Nassiit,
known ior his longrdistance runnr
ing (17-mile Krumm Nature
Preserve runs» Joined the team tor
conierence.

The team is growing in both size
and ability, This year there were 34
runners; next year I predict at
least that many, and the team in
general will be or a higher caliber,

Nighthawks Cruise

Last year the goal oi the team
was to win Conterence, and that
they did. This year their goal was
to train through Conierence. rer
taining their title. and place well at
regionals, In doing so. they learned
how to be a nationalrcallber team.
Hindsight has shown that they. as
well as teams such as Loras, could
have done two things better. One
was to run iewer meets earlier in
the season, saving their peak tor
the most important meets late in
the season. The other waste take
advantage ottheirincredibtedepth
and run the varsity at fewer meets,
allowing the next seven to com-
mand a iew races and allowing the
varsity a rest after a string oi
meets, In addition. Coach
Freeman has proposed a new
schedule tor next year it includes
higherievel meets in which the
team will learn to race against the
best teams in the nation. The end
result oi these changes. when put
together with the dedication the
team has already exhibited. should
be a stronger, better team.
