plc, their thoughts and opinions

Cleaver‘s most recent trip to Tokyo
took place irom 1979 until his return to
Grinnell this semester Under the
auspices ol the Japan/us. Friendship
Commission. Cleaver went to Keio
University to establish a chair at
American studies

While there he taught two large in
ti-oductory lecture courses in the
history at American culture and two
seminar courses. One seminar dealt
with minority groups in American
society and one compared American
and Japanese space and culture, This
seminar compared die geographic, ar-
chitectural and personal space in both
societies and a picture ol this class
taken at a going away party given lor
Cleaver is displayed on his desk.

Keio University has approximately
20,000 students, a far cry lroi-n
Grinnell's 1,200. But size is not the only
difference that Cleaver encountered in
his new teaching environment.

Cleaver explained that in Japan
students attend school {or a lull year
that begins in April and goes to
February with a short vacation period
in March. During the year students
take about 15 courses at a time that
meet once or twice a week One oi the
biggest dinerences that Cleaver notic-
ed was the way students in each coun-
try worked "Almost all who get into
the universities are going to graduate
and the students know that.‘ Cleaver
said. So once they get into school
many students don‘t work as hard as
the students do here "

Cleaver said that an additional
reason {or this was that each student
had to pass a very oilricult entrance ex-
am to get into school and that the ratio
of applications to admittances was 40 to
one He went on to explain that most
men in the university also know that
they'll get a job alter they graduate so
that all these lactors contribute to the
more relaxed approach to school by the
students,

Yet. 01 course. the single greatest l'acV
tor that Cleaver had to deal with at Keio
was the language barrier. Cleaver ex-
plained that there was a wide range 01
language skills among the students in
his classes. His courses were taught in
English and he noted that many oi his
students used tape recorders to aid
them in their work. Cleaver did say that
the biggest drawback that he en-
countered was havtng "to say
sophisticated things to sophisticated

minds in simple language. I felt like
Abraham Lincoln.”

Cleaver went on to explain that for
most students hearing and speaking
skills were their weakest areas in
understanding English so he used the
blackboard as much as possible to aid
in their understanding.

All 01 Cleaver‘s lectures were taped
and sent to the language lab and used as
examples of English Cleaver said that
one girl in his class objected to this
claim Alter haying spent [our years in
England she felt that what cleaver was
speaking was delinitely not "English."

As {or how his students dealt with the
language barrier Cleaver explained by
altering the following two anecdotes.
one student told Cleaver that the one
thing that he could count on at the end
or every class was havtng a headache
lrom all the translating he would have
to do. The other message came lrorn a
student in the form of a note at the end
0| an essay: ‘Mrry I wrote such a poor
essay but as I was writing my thesis
slipped sideways.‘

As tor the city of Tokyo itsell Cleaver
said that he "loves it " He described it
as a "City ot villages with lots or win»
ding streets that are great for walks."
Responding to the (act that Tokyo is
also one of the world's most crowded
Cities Cleaver said, "It's much cleaner
now and is no longer as polluted. You
can get rish trom the rivers again and
you can see Mount l-‘ugi on clear days "

Cleaver pointed out that one at the
biggest dinerences between Tokyo and
most American cities was the salety
factor "It is absolutely sale there and
there is very little crime because there
are almost no drugs or guns."

The real concern tor Cleaver. though,
is how the two cultures compare.
Cleaver sees Japan as a culture that
could be "the richest in the world." As
he said, "They have not only their tradi-
tional culture to take from but they can
also gran irom the Chinese and
American cultures,"

Cleaver sees the major difference
between the cultures as the mindset
that each group of people has towards
prosperity and its results, He explain-
ed, "Historically the United States has
exploited and then moved on. This ape
preach has created bad habits and
we‘re Just learning now to face some
limits.

"The Japanese have been rich l’or on-
ly is years of a history that is centuries
long. Since they have almost no natural
resources they've had to use a lot of in-
genuity and develop skills tor getting a
lot done in a small space. But they still
think pour, They realize how fast all
their success can go — especially when
you realize that they have oil reserves
of only about 90 days.

"But the system is working — even
though it shouldn't, It is in part still a
mystery to me, the only real natural
resource they have is the mind ’
