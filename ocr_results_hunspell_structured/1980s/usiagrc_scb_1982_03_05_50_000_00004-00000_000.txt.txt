concern tor
their own sanity

The Commitee on Academic Standing made some decisions in October
that will substantially change the organization of the academic year
starting next year. One nice change is there will be no Sunday exams or
registration clays. Fall semester will start on a Thursday; registration
will be on the previous Wednesday. New Student Days will begin on the
Saturday previous to that. But, and this is considered bad news to many
students, the final exam period is limited to five days. That translates
to: no buffer days. Of course, Saturday and Sunday can be counted as
buffer days . . . .

Saturdays and Sundays are much needed days of relaxation As it is,
weekends are mostly used to catch up on the barrage of work assigned

. during the week. When finals time approaches, weekends become even
more crucial as teachers speed up to finish scheduled lessons.

Buffer days are important and not for trivial reasons. When finals
time arrives, buffer days are essential for catch»up, study and simply
relieving some of the intense pressure of the season. One weekend is not
enough time for studying for finals, test-taking, packing and sleeping
the normal amount of time needed for human survival. Some Eastern
schools to which Grinnell is often compared, such as Harvard and
Brown, have extended “reading periods” of two to three weeks during
which a student prepares for exams.

The first ﬁling that springs to mind is, “Why were no students con-
sulted about the changes?” (This question seems oddly familiar.) In
fact, why isn’t there student representative on the Committee of
Academic Standing?

At the Oct. 5 faculty meeting Professor of Biology Karl DeLong also
wondered why students weren‘t consulted. He even suggested taking a
few minutes in the dinner line to determine student opinon. But, for the
sake of consistency, students weren’t involved in making the decisions
It is indeed obvious that students enjoy only a brief tenure at Grinnell
which has lead some people to believe that students do not care about
long term policy. Well, these calendar changes immediately affect most
students and will continue to affect some current students.

Furthermore, it is becoming obvious that students do care about the
future of Grinnell. For example many students at the core curriculum
forum Nov. 23 were upperclassmen. Other examples include par-
ticipants in the SAS, the demonstration for Magurshak and members of
the SGA who are working on long term projects which will be advan~
tageous for the classes to come.

Dean of Faculty Catherine Frazer made some suggestions for student
action involving the calendar. Since the calendar for 1982453 was finaliz»
ed in October, no changes can be made. Students can however propose
faculty legislation forbidding written assignments for the 10 days prior
to exams (unless a paper is a final exam). This ought to relieve some
pressure.

As for the 1983-84 calendar, students should start considering changes.
An SGA committee has been created to “look into faculty by-laws and to
develop a proposal so the faculty can change the 1983-89 calendar," said
David Molho, committee head.

This is an excellent opportunity for students to show that they care
and wish to become involved in administrative decisions Now all we
need is the cooperation of the faculty and administration.

A solution

It's obvrous that most of us here at Grin-
nell are deeply dissatisfied with both the
domestic and loreign policics or the
Reagan Administration. So what else is
new? The problem is that we all feel
somewhat helpless; we {eel that we have
no means of changing these harqul
policies.

Here is at least a partial solution: vote in
the congressional elections in November.
It sounds almost silly but. remember that
an obstinate Congress can do much to pre-
vent the president lrom pushing through
misguided programs Only higher voter
turnout Will produce such a legislature.

More specifically, you should seriously
consider voting here in Iowa, Iowa" '.’ Yes.
Even though a great majority or you do not
live in Iowa's Third Congressional
District, there are several reasons why ll.

_iS to your advantage to vote here.

First. the race lor Congress between
Republican incumbent Cooper Evans and
Democratic challenger Lynn Qitler is ex
pected to be close; in term Evans defeated
Cutler by a mere 6,000 votes or three per-
cent. The margin should be even narrower
this time, both because there will be no
presidential coattalls since it. is an ollryear
election and because the boundaries of the
district were redrawn. producing a more
Democratic constituency

On the other hand. the race in your home
district probably will not be so close; most
congressional elections are won by at least
a 10 percent margin and thus your vote has

What‘s with Deal] Frazer and the Cumr
mlttee OI Academic Standing? Why the
sudden urgency to "make the grade‘ or
get out? Let us explore this myslerious
behavior.

I'm on ac. prob ,dig I bit oil'moi‘e than I
could chew last semester. 16 credits. 1
play, 11 crosscountry meets and 16 hours
per week working at the Pub. So i ended up
dropping a course, a raunchy one at that
As a student on academic probation i must
earn 16 credits if I wish to remain a student
at Grinnell. Suddenly I feel like a caged
animal. Why? Because I've been

Scenario 1: First i give up my social tile.
The next thing I do is abandon all those
non-credit educational endeavors I take

in. not the ones which may be challenging

to Reagan

a better chance or making a dilrerence
here than in such a landslide at home If
you've heard Mr. Stone's argument that
voting is irrational since your individual
ballot will not decide the election, consider
the potential political force of a moblized
campus community; 1,000 or so votes
could easily be crucial in a close election

Women on campus have a further im»
petus to vote in this district. There are
curerntly only 14 women in the House of
Representatives — a gross misrepresenta»
tion. Lynn Cutler could be the 15th. admit-
tedly a modest increase, yet nonetheless
Significant.

Finally, whether you like itbr not, you're
an Iowan eight months or the year and
Iowa politics does affect you, so it makes
sense to have some input here.

So it you don't approve of unfair tax
breaks [or the rich, short-sighted Cuts in
student loans. increased military interven
tion in El Salvador, huge government
deficits, staggering increases in'dei'ense
spending at the expense or social pro-
grams or senseless exploration of the en-
vironment, please vote. and make yourself
heard. There is a real chance here to
defeat a Reagan “rubber stamp" and
replace him with someone more attuned to
our concerns and interests.

Voter registration is a quick and
painless process. You may register at

To the Editor:

In the Feb. 19 issue of the 5&3, an article
I wrote (“GCGC facing Catch~22 fun-
ding Situation") was printed alter it had
suffered severe editing. The article was
originally assrgned me as a straightrnews
story; however, as i was researching the
piece, [chose to change the emphasis of it.
The original article contained a great deal
of feature-oriented material. as well as
some editorial commentary running
throughout Much of this "elaboration" of
the [acts was cut from the original piece,
The printed rcsultwas a vaguearticlc with
