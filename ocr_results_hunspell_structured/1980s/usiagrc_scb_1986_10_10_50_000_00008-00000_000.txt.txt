The Fourth Man

By Kevin O'Prey
“The Fourth Man,” by Dutch director
Paul Verhoeven, is a NearGothic tale
centered on a selfrobsessed. religious,
alcoholic, and homosexual writer, Gerard
Reve. Reve describes his prose as the pro-
duct of his particular, albeit skewed, con
ception o1 reality, His fragmented life is in
creasingly haunted by torboding
epiphanies and symbolic hallucinations.
These visions become more pronounced
as he becomes increasingly involved with
a mysterious young widow, Christine.
Attracted by her boyish tigure, Gerard is
initially seduced by Christine, His momen-
tary interest, however, changes
dramatically when he spies a picture of
her hunk boyfriend 7 a dark Adonis whom
he had lusted after in a previous en»
counter. The odious Gerard stays wiui
Christine in order to engineer a visit from
her boyfriend, Yet as he nears the seduc-
tion. his epiphanies and a mysterious
Madonna figure lead Gerard to believe
that either he or the boyfriend is doomed.

Christine has had three husbands 7 all of
whom have died through strange cirr
cumstances, Convinced that she is a witch,
Gerard realizes that he may be her next
victim — the fourth man.

Director Paul Verhoeven has created a
slick and highly stylized film that pays
homage, at various times. to all ol his
tavorite directors: Bergmann. Bunuel,
and most prominently, Hitchcock, His
direction of “The Fourth Man” incor-
porates the glossiness oi “Diva” with the
abstract symbolism oi middlehergmann,
Verhoeven is particularly adept at weave
ing his various loreshadowings into a
climax that ties this cacophony together.
Jeroen Krabbe, as Gerard, is delightiully
repulsive in his incessant machinations,
Concluding with nothing less than some
Divine intervention, “The Fourth Man” is
a stylish, accessible, and witty film that is
also a lot of fun.

The Irnportance of
., Bemg Earnest

By Jill El \

“The Importance oi Being Earnest '
(1952) is the film version of Oscar Wilde’s
wonderful play ANY version of this play
can't go wrong, because the original script
is such a delight, filled with witticisms and
sarcasm and Wilde's infamous disregard
for nineteenthcentury society.

Set in England in the laws, “The impor—
tance of Being Earnest" tells the tale of
two friends. bath wealthy and eligible
bachelors, and dieir attempts to marry the
right women despite the myriad or
obstacles and difficulties traditionally
associated with Victorian England (not to
mention the fact mat both the women think
they're engaged to a man, Ernest Wor-
thington, who doesn't actually exist). The
film stars Sir Michael Redgrave (father of
actresses Vanessa and Lynn-Yes Jack‘ Wor-
thing and Michael Denlson as Algernon
Moncrief. (It’s a bit difficult to figure out

who's who at first. because there is a lot of
fooling around with names.) Joan Greenr

Gideon's getting old, though, and he's
iinding it harder and harder to make it
through each day. Every college student
facing mid-semester exams will be able to
identify with Gideon as he goes through his
daily morning routine: he turns on his
stereo lVivaldl—LOUD), “gets the red
out" with the help of a bottle of eyedrops.
Jumps into a quick shower, lights up a
cigarette (he's out of the shower by now, of

Grinnell College's department oi music
will present James Fudge and Barbara
Lien in an American musical theatre
lecturerrecital presentation on Friday,
Oct. 10 at B p.m, in the South Lounge of the
Forum. Fudge and Lien. faculty members
at Grinnell College, will sing, play, and
discuss the Broadway songs at Arthur
Schwartz and his main lyricist, Howard
DietZ.

Schwartz was born in Brooklyn, NY on

umbia University at about me same time
that Oscar Hammerstein ll, Lorenz Hart,

working on the famed Varsity Shows.
Schwartz brielly pursued his father's pro-
fession as a lawyer, and Dietz was a vice-
president ior MetrorGoldwynrMeyer, By
the mid 1920s, both had fallen in love with
songwriting and the Broadway theatre.
Thus began their careers as composer-
lyricist tor famous revues. .

Fudge has had an interest in the
American musical theatre for the past six
years, beginning when he taught courses
in the college's rreshman tutorial system.
He continues work on Rodgers and Hart,
for which he gave a similar recital in 1983,

though: Her delivery of such a simple line

This film has been criticized for lacking

be either an adaptaton or a piece of filmed

not wholly either” (Gavin Lambert). I

in the mirror with a forced smile and the
ClaSSlC line, ”It’s showtime!"

This movie is about show 2. and por-
trays that way of life realistically, The
dance scenes are excellent — legs, torsos,
energy and music abound, Fosse’s
choreography is as good as ever here,
Some of the scenarios are a little trite,
though, as in Gideon’s love-hate relation-
ship with his ex-Wlle (Leland Palmer), and
his affair with one of the dancers in his
show lVictoria, played by Deborah Geff-
ner) The point is that this is showcbiz, and
in showrhiz actors often keep on acting
even when they're off-stage.

The more important facet of this film is
Gideon's thoughts and tears of death. His
encounter with the female version of the
grim reaper, Angelique (Jessica Lange) is
confusmg e I'm still not sure I quite
understand it — but certainly thoughtr
provoking. The grand {male is a musical
routine entitled “Bye-Bye Life, Bye-Bye
Happiness” wiui a huge cast Singing and
dancing as Joe’s decrepit old body finally
gives out on him. The contrast is striking.

A final warning: although this film has
its funny moments. it gets rather
gruesome at times Prepare yourself for
some graphic close-ups of real-life open-
heart surgery in progress, If you’re
squeamish, cover your eyes at the gory
parts “All That Jazz” is a bit bizarre, but
a good tilm nonetheless.
