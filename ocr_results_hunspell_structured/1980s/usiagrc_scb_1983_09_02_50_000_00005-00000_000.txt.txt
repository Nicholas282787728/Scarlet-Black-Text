It ain't the real thing no more

byleonlouse

Anyone who watches television,
reads magazines, newspapers or
billboards, listens to the radio, or isn't
deaf, dumb and blind knows that the big
gest product on the market this summer is
caffeine free solt drinks. The model’s
vulgar smile lets you know that if you
drink these concoctions, you'll never be
nervous, always be happy. For some
reason, just the idea of these wretched
beverages turns me into a neurotic mess

Yes sir, the public has become
schizophrenic about the possibility of be-

put out. They took the cocaine out and look
what happened 7 the depression. Now, the
corporate morons have decided to remove
the remaining beneficial ingredients,

First, they removed the caffeine. Yet
anyone who has ever tried near beer
laicohol free beer) knows that when you
remove key elements from an intoxicant,
you’ve got one lousy product. I've got a
friend who drinks a can of Coke ﬁrst thing
every morning. He ligures the cat
ieine/sugar combination is the only way to
get started. Can you imagine what would

ing keyed up on a catieine buzz. i rather
like me high, and can’t understand why
anyone would drink one of these foul
tasting liquids if there wasn’t any alter inr
,gestion pickrmerup The worst offender in
the area of caffeine free soft drinks is the
Coca~Coia company.

Coke, in its original incarnation, was tru-
ly the ultimate drink. Cocaine, caffeine,
and sugar were the main reasons for his
country‘s turn of the century product‘i ity.
A country pumped up is a country that can

happen if he missed the caiieine? Hell, he
might as well never get up. But it gets
worse.

In addition to caffeine free Coke. they’ve
put out caffeine free Diet Coke. When I saw
the ad, I thought I was going to vomit.

Three strikes v end of game; first co- -

caine, then catteine, now sugar. Just think
if we all drink this, we'll have a nation of
slender, non-neurotic people. what a terri»
ble thought.

The Case of the
Missing SGA

Guidebook

by Joe Neri

In the summer or 1932, a student was
given the not so large task oi writing a
short and simple guide to the constitution,
committees, and oliicers or die SGA, Joint
Board appropriated the money tor the
booklet hoping that the guide would help
and encourage students to use SGA
resources to the iullest potential.

When Joint Board convened lor the
19824983 school year they found that the
booklet was not completed, A few
members ol the board were enraged, so
Vice president Mark Bradshaw said that

he would compile uie booklet. it took near»
ly the entire semester and when it was
completed Joint Board did not like it. A
iew members ol the board felt that it was
not explicit enough, so a committee was
formed to rewrite the booklet. The rewrite
took another semester, but .loint Board lik-
ed this Version.

With the booklet completed, Joint Board
then had to decide how they would print it
since the year progressed. As the year end-
ed the student body, which should have
had access to the guide at the beginning of
1982, had to wait until the 198384 school
year. There is only one problem — the
booklet has been lost and will have to be
done over. It was on a student’s computer
tile and she has now graduated.

 

Why anyone would drink this wicked in
vention is beyond me, Let’s face it 7 Coke
is not the best tasting soft drink around. I
don’t even know what it’s made ot rm told
it's cola beans, but l've never seen a cola
bean and 1 don’t know anyone who has
seen a cola bean. And even if there is a cola
bean. how do they get the caffeine out ot
the bean? They probably soak the beans in
a chemical which at this very moment is
eating away at the stomach linings ol
millions of Americans who drink calleine
iree cola. Not that these people don’t
deserve it; anyone who falls for the pitch
gets what they pay for

i wrote my congressman about this pro
blem and he relerred me to the House Un»
American Activities Committee I wrote
them and a c LA. agent visited my house
and inspected my refrigerator. He told me
to drink what the man on TV tells me to
drink: “The tree enterprise system knows
what's best for you, college boy.” He gave
me a coupon good {or ten cents all on my
next purchase or Mace and went on his
way.

I’ve since bought a case of NorDoze and
a live pound bag or sugar. I guess i beat
the system.

The Iowa
Caucus.

by Eric Green

Leaving Darby Gym last Wednesday
atter registration, i noticed a table set up
by the Mondale campaign. its presence il~
iustrates some interesting things about
presidential politics and elections,

A typical reaction to the Mondale table
by are unseasoned voter is probably,
“What are they doing here?” why should
Mondale send campaign workers to a col-
lege of 1,200 students when they could be
doing more important things, like raising
money?

The arbitrarily early date of the Iowa
caucusses explains the presence of Mon-
dale's lackeys on campus. The media has
seized upon the early caususses and
primaries (most notably that of New
Hampshire) as indicators of the national
mood, Thus, when George Bush got a
favorable response in the 1980 Iowa
caucus, he asserted that he had enough
momentum to win the Republican nomina-
tion. As we know, the subsequent
primaries and election did not turn out
well for Mr. Bush nor the rest of the counr
try.

 

The Iowa caucus will once again be
hyped and the “winner" will be crowned
lront-runner, “Victory", however, is not
always what the media portrays, For ex
ample, after Iowa’s district and state can
ventions, Mr. Bush ended up with the sup
port of only sixteen ol Iowa‘s 37 delegates
to the 1980 Republican National Conven-
tion.

This process of Selection, in which small
states have the opportunity to manipulate
the media and inﬂuence the rest of the
country, grossly distorts the principle or
"one personrone vote." it is no secret that
the Democratic candidates are keying on
Iowa; all will campaign extensively and
most will visit Grinnell as Gary Hart
already has. Would Grinnell merit this sort
of attention if it was located in Missouri, a
state with a larger population and more
delegates? Obviously the timing of the
states' selection processes aliects how
much say they have on who eventually
wins. Under the present system, voters in
the states that choose earlier have more
say,

Although the nomination process may
provide a convenient outlet for our aggres
sions, parties have the right to select cane
didates in any manner they choose Ex~
amination oi‘ the electoral college‘s con
tinued use in the general election reveals
glaring inadequacies which should cons
cern everyone who believes in the “one
person-one vote” principle. Recall how in
The Federalist Papers, Alexander
Hamilton justifies the electoral college by
saying, “A small number or persons,
selected by their lellow citizens from the .
general mass, will be most likely to
possess the information and discernment
requisite to so complicated an investiga»
tion,”

Because the “general mass" now votes
for the president directly, the elitest spirit
of the framers' design has been hideously
violated. The relative sophistication of
modern voters may or may not merit
direct elections; such direct elections are
unfair, however, when conducted within
the elitest framework of the electoral col-
legs.

The problem lies in the fact that when a
candidate “wins" a state, he or she
receives all M ﬂ’iat state’s electoral votes.
if a candidate gets one more vote than an
opponent in Caliiornia is he really entitled
to all 47 electoral votes? In 1876 and 1388,
this mixed-up system gave us presidents
who got fewer votes than their opponents.

A danger i foresee as a result of the wine
ner takes all system is that candidates,
especially incumbents, will cater to the in-
terest of voters in important states, Jim-
my Carter used this tactic, in his will
primary battle, by providing extra tederai
money to states belore their primary elecr
tions. .
Despite the fact that there is no way to
make politics ethical, it would not hurt to
abolish uie electoral college, thus giving
each vote equal weight and assuring that
the person with the most votes will be
elected.
