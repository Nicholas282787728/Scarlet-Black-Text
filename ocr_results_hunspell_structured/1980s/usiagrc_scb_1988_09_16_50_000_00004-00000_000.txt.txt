Women object
to harassment

To the Editor:

In light of several incidents
of sexual harassment that have
occurred in campus and in town
to ourselves or friends of ours
this scmmter. we feel it is
necessary that the issue become
a matter of public concern and
that immediate action be taken
to alleviate this problem.

Sexual harassment is not only
rape. but may also include
obscene phone calls. verbal
harassment and such things as the
singing of songs referring to
gang-rape at a recent off-campus
party. Sexual harassment at
Grinnell is nota new issue, and
appears to be occun-ing with
increased frequency. In a poll
taken on campus in the spring
semester, 1988, for Sociological
Methods, 51.8% of the female
students polled said they had

been sexually harassed while at
Grinnell.

With this in mind, we
support the establishment of a
student»mn escort service. such
as the one at the University
of Chicago where students,
faculty. and staff can call the
service for an escort from
wherever they are at to their des-
tination. We also suggest imr
proved lighting on campus and
on streets bordering the campus.
If this issue concerns you,
please speak to an SGA repre»
sentative and let them know you
support these measures. Any ac»
tion you would be willing to take
would be greatly appreciated

GLGA to select
representatives

To the Editor:

The Grinnell Lesbian and Gay
Alliance (GLGA), formerly
known as GCGC. has undergone
some positive changes for this
coming year. Last Sunday, rc-
turning mcmbers of the gay and
lesbian community met together
to discuss the future structure and
concerns of the group. We had
this meeting because we are cur
mud)! in transition, attempting to
serve the diverse needs of the
campus and town of Grinnell.
The newly formed Grinnell Lesr
bian and Gay Alliance (GLGA)
hopes to handle personal and
community needs as well as
political activities. The name
Grinnell College Gay
Community was changed to
GLGA to reflect this new
diversity.

The returning students decided
to hold a meeting to present their
ideas to the group as a whole on
Thursday. September 22nd, at
9:00 pm in the Gay Resource
Center. At this important
meeting, the community will

select two facilitators to co-
represent the group as a whole.
These are not authoritative
positions. The two facilitators
will not be in charge of the
group. It will simply be their
responsibility to represent the
group's opinions. The two peo-
ple, one male. one female, will
be responsible for record keeping
of events of interest. It will be
the job of the facilitators to keep
the community abreast of
upcoming events on our campus.
other campuses in Iowa, and
events of national concern. To do
this, the facilitators must keep in
constant contact WlLl‘l GLGA as a
whole, as well as other campuses
and organizations.

The facilitators will be
chosen by a general consensus.

Thursday‘s meeting. Those who
are concerned with the present and '
future state of GLGA should
attend. Grinnell Lesbian and

Seaman responds to criticism
of KDIC's programming

To the Editor:

As Station Manager of KDIC
FM I feel it my duty to respond
to Mike Kent's opinion column
of last week.

I would agree with you in
saying that one purpose which
KDIC serves is to give members
of the Grinnell community, not
just students, and opportunity to
work at a radio station. This,
however, is not the only purpose
which KDIC servesi As I see
things in my grand View of this
world, KDIC is an oasis in the
desert of Top—40 Iowa Radio.
Our purpose then, is to expose
the Grinnell Community to as
wide a variety of music as
possible. to expose the
community to as much new
music as possible, and to serve
the needs of the community
through news, public service an»
nouncements and special pror
grammmg,

In programming KDIC’s
schedule the executive staff of
KDIC attempts to select what we
believe will be quality shows,
and shows which are an
alternative to the 7 or so TopAO
stations which broadcast 24hrs
per day. Hence we are called

alternative radio.

As for your assenion that
"music played on the radio
station should reflect the
preferences of all of the student
body, as opposed to any certain
fraction,"

1) We are not here solely for
the entenainment and education
of the Grinnell College student
WY;

2) because we have a limited
applicant pool. our program
schedule reﬂects the musical
preferences of that applicant pool
and not the entire Grinnell
Community.

You state that air time given
“to any style of music should be
proportional to the number of
people in the student body who
want to hear that kind of music".
You are correct in saying that
you are taking your life in your
own hand ' First of all, we are
not catering solely to the student
body. Secondly, as I have said
previously, we are alternative
radio and in order to bring to
Grinnell new and different types
of music we can not limit
ourselves only to what people
want to hear. Finally, I would

Kent's column on

KDIC "j

To the Editor:

This letter arrives in response
to Mike Kent's rather jarring
opinion column concerning
KDIC‘s "movement to conforr
mity.” Perhaps it is jarring solely
to us, for Mr. Kent's vision of
KDIC is so remotely similar to
that of the staff.

KDIC prides itself on
presenting alternative musical
styles to the Grinnell
Community as professionally as
possible. Our programming is
well planned and farrreaching,
considering our small campus
base. We feel that radio is a
powerful element of student life
and can prove valuable to our
musical education. For this
reason. considerable effort has

ars" reader

gone into
programming.

Concerning the exclusion of
pop music from our program
ming, our three top-fourty
applicants (of 120 total) would
probably attcst to "quality" of the
seven»odd other local pop
stations. Our choice of DJ's
"purely on the basis of musical
tastes" (1) reﬂects our desire for
professionalism, If we indeed
were to claim that "one of the
purposes of the radio station is to
give students a chance to try out
DIing." my 6048 allotted
minutes of programming would
include as much quality music as
possible that no one has heard
before I. Shillrol‘f

truly like to see you develop a
radio schedule for Grinnell
College based on the premise of
playing only what people want to
hear. I would also like to hear
such a schedule and I would hazy
zard to guess that it would sound
much like the other Top-40 star
[ions in lowa.

Mike. for my parting shots, I
musr add ﬁrst of all, that it is
also my tuition money. as well
as support from Grinnell
merchants and residents, and gifts
from alumni which keep the S
and B in print and KDIC on the
air. Finally. if we were to divide
our airtime equally among
students, Mike. you would
receive 6.72 minutes of airtime.
l have done even more for you
Mike. You or any other member
of the Grinnell community may
have approximately 7.5 minutes
of air time in which to air your
views on a subject of your
choice. If you or any member of
the Grinnell community is inter-
ested in this air time following
the SGA news show on Monday
nights. you may contact me in
the KDIC office(x3335).Wayne
