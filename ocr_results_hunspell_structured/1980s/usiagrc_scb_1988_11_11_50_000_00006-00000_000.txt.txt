Chekov's The Three

 

 

Theatre dept. to present
Chekovfs Three Sisters

by Seth Peterson

The theatre department will
present four performances of
Chekov's Three Sisters next
weekend. This play was origi-
nally written for the Moscow Art
Theatre, whose foundeis, directors
Konstantin Stanislavsky and
Vladimir NemirovichrDanchenko,
Chekov frequently collaborated
with. When it ﬁrst appeared on
stage at the Moscow Art Theatre
in 190]. Three Sisters was re-
ceived with great skepticism by
critics. However, today it is the
longest running, most frequently
revived Russian play.

Ellen Mease. who is
directing Grinnell‘s production of
this play, commented that
Stanislavsky's influence tended to
turn Chekov‘s pieces into real
drama, making the characters
more "melodramatic and tragic."
This playwright's works generr
ally examine the inability or
seeming unwillingness of indi-
viduals to improve their lot by
providing an ironic perspective.

As both a doctor and a
playwright, Chekov was particu—
larly sensitive to the human con»
dition. He seems partial to the
sufferings of ordinary people. The
setting for Three Sisters is a

small provmeial town in Russia.
It explores human emotions such
as despair, hope, and delight
through a focus on an upperclass
family and three sisters who are
disenchanted with their circum-
stances. All three long for
Moscow, the cultural center -- the
fulfillment of their hopes and
dreams. Although each has her
own fantasy or notion of happi-
ness associated with Moscow, it
is hcr inability to find the glimp—
tion to move, and more speciﬁ-
cally the way in which each
copes with her discontent, that
creates the action in this play. It
is likely that members of the au~
dience will feel critical of the way
these women respond to their
situation. Yet, one also becomes
sympathetic to their circum»
stances and begins to question
whether the real problem is in the
character, her society, or society
in a general sense.

Throughout it seems the
sisters endeavor to delight in life
rathcr than wallow in their bur-
densome sorrow. This play epitr
omizes the melodramatic tragedy,
yet the crowd is kept from ex—
tremes of morbid contemplation
by the clever use of comic tones
and the inspiration of persevere
ance.

A guest lecturer, Professor
Ehrc of the University of
Chicago's Russian department
will be visiting campus on Fri»
day, November 18 at 4:30 pm.
He will speak in Robert's Theatre
on, "The World of Chekov's
plays," and everyone is encour—
aged to attend. Ehre‘s daughter,
Julieanne, has the part of Irina in
Grinnell's production of Three
Sisters.
Performances of Three
Sisters will be in Robert's
Theatre: Thursday, Nov.17, 8
pm. Friday, Nov.18, 8 pm.
Saturday, Not/.19, 1 pm. and 8
pm.
