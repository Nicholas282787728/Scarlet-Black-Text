Student Rob Killion, who
nominated Hutton. said that her
knowledge of her subject, En-
glish, “goes well beyond her
master’s degree. She has always
impressed me as a teacher who
has a firm grasp on her chosen
field However, I’ve had many
intelligent, knowledgeable teach-
ers who were poor educators.
Mrs. Hutton understands the
Skills needed to share her knowl-
edge.“

Killion praised what he

termed her “compassion“ for her
students. “Mrs. Hutton has an
interest in her students that
doesn't end at the classroom
door," he said, citing as an
example Hutton's reaction to a
freshman class's unkind treatment
of another student. On a day
when the student was absent.
Killien said. “Mrs Hutton used
that class to talk with us about
differences in human beings and
how much cruelty can hurt peo-
ple."
