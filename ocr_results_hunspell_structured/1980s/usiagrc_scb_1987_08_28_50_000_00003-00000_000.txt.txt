An‘unfortunate

oversight

The ﬁrst thing most returning
students noticed when they ar-
rived here at Grinnell was the
series of large gray-andsiiver
signs adorning the lawns. Every
major building has it. own gray
liametag prominently placed in
the green grass Despite the
rather skeptical option given

. these signs by upperclassrncn.
freshmen and new students
see... to be overwhelmingly in
favor of them. In a surrey of o7
freshmen and three new
students, almost all thought the
neu- sleek signs were “helpful",-
sonte said “very helpful." Many
expressed their disbelief that
Crinnell had ever been without
such useful identification
markerl.

However anyone feels about
the new signs, it is the lack of
one sign in particular that has
stirred the mast emotions. To
put it plainly.- there is no such ID
before the Block Cultural
Center. There is a sign on the
corner in front of the house. It
lists the PEC and the Physical
Plant but makes no mention of
the Black Cultural Center
directly across from the sign.

Understandably, many
students wondered what was go.
ing an. The human and gay
resource centers are labeled
with a sign. They are also listed
separately in the blue student
directory. The Black Cultural
Center is not listed.

Naturally, many black
students felt they had been
slighted. Several complained to
Steven Jones in Minority Affairs
and were told a sign would be
coming. But no one could tell
them exactly what had happen.
ed, why, and when the problem
would be dealt with. Mean-
while, one freshnian, Eugene

Weaver, had much difficulty
locating the Black Cultural
Center to attend a meeting for
minority studentr. He was oblig—
ed to walk in the rain for quitt-
some time before he found the
correct house.

in an interview for the Scarlet
and Black, Acting President
Waldo Walker stressed that the
milission letti- not intentional.
Although no sign was originally
ordered specifically for the
Black Cultural Center. atlllh
tional plaqueli had been ordered
in case it was later discovered
that a building was missed. The
order in which tlte signs with
names were delivered was left to
the manufacturer‘s (.451 Sign
systems of Crinnell) discretion.
Walker stressed that all the signs
for the residence-type houses on
Park street are not in place
either. They are expected at a
later date.

Now that the omission of the
Bloch Cultural Center’s sign has
been brought to his attention,
Walker said the remaining extra
plaque will be used to identify
the center. It should be in place
in (than! a week.

It is unfortunate that this over-
sight occurred Grinnell College

These feelings have been hurt.
Let us hope that the administra-
tion learns front this unfur—

future pains will be taken to
consider all factors — human
and mechanical.

that all students, and particularly
those who come to Gritmell, need
to experience the advantages and
drawbacks of ireedom betore they
can structure their lives. “Your inr
lital experience is ireedom without
responsibility, but you have to
learn to have lreedom with the
responsibility at studying and
maintaining your grades it you're

going to succeed,” says Nugeni.

A cadem ics

For many new studenu the crane
sition from high-school academics
to the course load of College lS a dif-
iiculi. one. “You can always tell the
day when freshmen get their first
test back,” says Grady, recollec-
ling that some students woulu be
reduced to tears by poor grades

Grady states that many students
eater college with the notion that it
will be merely a repeat at their
successful high»school Careers.
“Students Come out here with real
1y high expectations, but they don't
always reallze that the work is go-
ing to be much tougher,” he says.

Counselor Lisa Bard oi the Grin-
nell Mental Health Center says
that most academic problems she
sees among new students can be
traced to poor study habits
developed in high school. “With
many students, academic pro-
blems involve procrastination. in
high school. some students could
get by doing their papers the night
beiare, but they find that they can’t
do that in college,” comments
Bard.

Bard adds that studenw “often
have a really hard time organizing
their work either because they
have low self esteem or there is an
internal coutlivi where they're
resisting the rules...we have to try
and counsel them to overcome
these it they're going to get by."

Wilson was initially shocked at
the difference between high-school
and college work. Wilson round
that her haphazard highrschool
routine did not work in college. “I
could do a paper the night belore
(in high School} and still pull a ‘A’
or ‘b,’ but at Grinnell I had to learn
to prepare work ahead at time and
schedule everything."

Senior Deanna Bickiord concurs.
“I never thought about how dilv
ﬁcult the work would be until I got
here...your first bad test or paper
grade really shakes you up."

Bicklord advises new students to
laid a place where they are com
ioriable studying. “The tirsl
month of school I would just keep
wandering irom building to
building trying to find a spot which
was for me. Eventually I found a
corner in the library where I could“
reallv study without distractions."

Partrctﬂatmg

Major hurdles lat freshmen to
surmount include the daunting
tasks at approaching particularly
intimidating professors and par-
ticipating in class discussions.

“Students ﬁnd extremely smart
or aggressive prolessors to be
unapproachable,” says Thomas
Brozoski, a psychology professor
and academic adviser. He warns
that [his is “the worst mistake a
student can make...ii there is
something the student doesn’t
understand, the protessor is there
to clarify matters "

Brozoski asserts that ll is imr
peraitve (or students to overcome
shyness and participate in class.
”It’s like the protagonist In the
”Paper Chase” who doesn't know
whether to risk embarrassment
and ridicule by speaking (in

classi...siudeuis should not be m-
timidated by their instructors
about asking questions. there's
really no question which is too
trivial ”

Although the prospect at par
iicipating in class is a somewhat
nervewracking one [or all
ireshmen. Brozoski believes it
pays dividends. “When you say
something intelligent, it’s like the
room lS liiied. it really is ex-
hilaralmg," says Brozoskl. “ ou
have the alternative oi just si ing
there but carrots are passive too
and sometimes you just have to
rise above the vegetable state.”
