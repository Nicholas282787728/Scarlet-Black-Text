All-Campus parties
Are they worth remembering?

by Kim MacDonald

The great problem with allcampus par
ties is that very few people remember
anything about them. Either one gets
bombed, and the memory of the night
before lasts about as long as the hangover
the next day; or one doesn’t get bombed,
and who wants to remember watching 400
drunk people getting more drunk?
“They're all the same," according to one
senior, “you get a band, you get drunk, and

you dance."

The bands, the themes even the
costume you wore or didn't wear seem to
fade into oblivion. It was necessary to ask
over 20 seniors, including some former
residents of Loose Hall, before someone
remembered what band played for Loose
Hall Ball their freshman year. Finally, off
the top of his head, someone exclaimed
“Jone’sin,” “Oh yeah, weren't they a band
from Newton that was friends with the hall
coordinator?" another person asked.

A decade ,doesn’t make a difference

Some things don’t change

by Terri Porter

The times they are archangin', but the
all-campus parties at Grinnell don't ap»

pear to be keeping pace.

Although seniors believe there are some
differences between the parties now verr
sus those four years ago. they aren't sure
whether it's due to the parties themselves

or the seniors’ growing older.

Donna Savage, an R.A, and alumna of
Grinnell, feels much the same way about
changes in the parties now as compared
wiﬂi ten years ago, when she attended

Grinnell. __

Savage remarked that, on the whole, the
differences seemed few. She noted the fact
that, because they serve alcoholic
beverages now whereas they didn't in the
past, as she recalls. the parties are pro»

bably a little more “rowdy."

Before the times of serving mass quan-
tities of beer at these events, Savage
remembers people partying beforehand or
bringing their own containers of alcohol to

the party.

Savage noted that the parties were ”a
little more mellow" because marijuana
was more popular than alcohol a decade
ago. She commented. “It's probably a lit
tle more rowdy now — not So much
because the people have changed but
because what they ingest is changed,"

“One thing that hasn't changed." accor-
ding to Savage, “is the way people feel
after all-campus parties," She explained,
“There seems to be a letdown for a lot of
people because everybody else seems to be
having a great time, and they [the letdown
ones] aren't."

Savage feels the overall atmosphere is
still the same 7 one of drinking, dancing
and socializing. The atmosphere hasn‘t
changed much in a decade,

Will it be much different in the future?
Probably not. Savage believes “the
elements which provide the atmosphere
essentially stay the same," and, assuming
the type of students Grinnell attracts re»
mains relatively stable, so should the all»
campus parties.

Some of ﬁle bands have been a bit more
memorable for a variety of reasons. Most
everyone remembers the band that played
their freshman year, the Britons, a
psuedo-BeaLles band. "Laugh-in" was the
theme that year. and everyone dressed up
as ‘605 flower children.

Three years ago the inevitable con-
troversy that every Gang Bang seems to
provoke broke out .because James Hall
decided to hire a campus band, The Johns
(a previous charlie Briggs band including
Greg Luther, Mike Heckman and Mike
Alexander). “That was the year everyone
was bitching," recalled one senior, “and
The Johns turned out to be really good."
Those of us in London remember reading
our four week old copies of the 5&3 and
thinking, “What a fuss they're making at
Grinnell over the silly NAME of a party.”
Sometimes, you just have to be there.

Looking back, the Loose Hall Ball seems
to be a less controversial event, with the
exception oi the stink raised last year.
From the first tongue in cheek article in
the 5&3 that everyone thought was serious
(Yee han), to the $144 spent on Chewing
tobacco, to the not so indistinguishable
“Wanted Poster" that the SGtB reprinted
on the editorial page, last year's ball will
go down in history as the one that offended
almost every student on campus.

Many seniors think the nature of all~
campus parties has changed. but they
can't tell whether they've just grown older
or if the parties are actually different
“They're more concert oriented now. .
complained one senior, .. . . it used to be
that when the band ended, people stayed
and talked. Now they all leave, and there is
less talking while the band plays.”

“You used to meet people when you went
to those things," lamented another
woman. “and now you stand and you
dance. Period." Perhaps the attitude
towards the parties has Changed because
of the sudden proliieration of all~campus
parties and events. “Now they're not as
special. . . they used to be a big deal”
argued one senior. After 8 minutes cons
templation, her friend agreed, noting that
there were two dances in the past week
alone.

The consumption of drugs and alcohol
seems to be down too. If seniors are to be
ousted, people seem to be drinking less
copious quantities and doing iewer drugs
than in recent years. “Now the ireshmen

, don't drink, . . they dress up, but they don't
get wasted like we did,” someone
lamented. “People used to get ripped;
they’re calmer now. It’s not the total trash
out that it used to be," observed another
woman.

Gone are the stories of people freaking,
passing out, climbing out the windows of
Darby and the like. “Man it used to be
legendary 7 you'd look up and see people
passed out on the tops of the bleachers. It
was awesome for us freshmen,” come
mented another senior. _

One of the big questions, though, is
whether the seniors are the ones who are
drinking less. Someone argued that the

March of last year. 5&3 File Photo.

ireshmen still get drunk and that probably
freshmen will always get drunk because
“they're tense. , worried about fitting
in."

Several seniors recalled that they were
simply scared oi all-campus parties when.
they were freshmen. Apparently though.
by the time junior year rolls around, not
only have students lost any ieelings oi
trepidation about all-campus parties, but
they've lost interest in them as well.

By the time they've been through {our

-years oi all-campus parties, studenls‘

reactions run from ”yeah, they're all fun.
they're all the same," to “I don't go
anymore," to “they're horrible, you have
fun before and you have fun after, but durr
mg?”

Nevertheless. there's still enough in
terest in allcampus parties for yet another
one to be invented, Maybe its a sign of
prestige‘tc have a big bash. There's the
Loose Hall Ball. the James Hall Bacchane
dal, the Cleveland Hall Crawl, the Main
Event, Younker's Halloween parties,
Haines Alice in Wonderland party, and
Dibble Wednesdays. What's the story -
Smith. Langan, Read, Clark, Cowles, Nor-
ris’.’
