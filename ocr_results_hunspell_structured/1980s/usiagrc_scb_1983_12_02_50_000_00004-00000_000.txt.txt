F I l ,

With today‘s edition The Scarlet and Black ceases publication for the
first semester. In all, thirteen issues appeared, each with a unique
spirit * a spirit which in some cases still returns to haunt the editors.
Few people will ever realize the difficulties and uncertainties
associated with producing the 8&8. To those who offered help and add»
ed certainty, we thank you and hope that the paper provided at least
some small amount of enjoyment. To the silent malcontents and others
who ridiculed our efforts yet lacked the conviction for open criticism,
remember; your claptrap marks you as absurd so long as you allow
others to do the job you could do so well. Finally, to all aspiring editors,

staff members, and intersted third parties, we pass along the follow-
ing advice 7 call it the collected wisdom of the old order,

(USPS 483-000)

The first semester staff of The Scarlet and Black accepted the creed
of objectivity set forth by the apostles of traditional journalism. We
believed that newspapers should report events as impartially as possi-
ble. For me most part, we consciously followed this dictum and
refrained from interposing news stories with our own opinions.
However, we have since learned that objectivity is a hoax. Therefore,
we recommend that the paper

ABANDON OBJECTIVITYI

Although people warned us to avoid the false promise of objectivity,
saying that only acolytes of vulgar scientism and other eccentrics still
believed in its existence, we ignored their pleas and tried to produce a
paper free of biases. What we ended up with was something weak and
ineffective We should have foreseen this pitfall.

In the future The Scarlet and Black must establish itself as the
defender of student interests. Each week it must use its resources and
act as a siren to wake students from their moral slumber. In abandon—
ing objectivity, the paper must not also abandon accuracy,
thoroughness, and honesty. These ideals work best.under unobjective
conditions anyhow, since fairness requires that we admit our biases.
Furthermore, if the 5&3 is to act as a forum for student opinion,
fairness demands that editors accept articles by students with a varie-
ty of biases, Readers, then,in perusing the paper, may select the good
articles from the bad and determine whether their beliefs necessitate a
response Unobjectivity has much to offer. We strongly urge future
staff members to recognize unobjectivity as an unavoidable condition
of human existence and take this opportunity to make The Scarlet and
Black a truly effective organ of student interest.

Unfortunately, the campus may never realize the blessings of unob-
jective reporting. As the paper goes to the press this week, only four
students have applied for positions on next semster‘s staff. Four people
cannot put out the paper. Should this lack of interest continue, the cur

rent staff says
ABOLISH THE SCARLET AND BLACK!

If students refuse to work for the paper and prefer to engage
themselves in other activities, then the paper should cease publication.
The thousands of dollars allocated to the 5&3 could than be reallocated
to satisfy actual student demand. An end to the paper means more
money for dances, all campus parties, and fun movies. We advise all
students to consider their priorities and follow their best interest

Letters

Dear Sir:

in the Nov. 18, 1983 issue of the 5&8 and
for the last few weeks previous, much
energy by various Grinnellians has been
speni pointing out “Another major pro-
blem with the Solomon Amendment "
(Edwards in 5&87. Perhaps the biggest
problem with the Solomon Amendment is
that it is unquestionably a law. Some may
question ifs "collslitutionalily". however.
that is not for us to decide. That question
will be determined ill the court of law. Unr
til some legal or legislative action is taken.
the law will remain a law.

though there are valid objections to [his
law, the law remains a law and a more
honorable mode of action for those who

Focus

by Barry Edwards

The Grinnell student body is, in general,
intelligent and well informed. Because of
these traits, the students are capable of
making worthwhile political judgements
and statements. The Student Government
Association (S.G.A.), however, is not the
correct medium through which they
should pursue political activity for many
reasons Most importantly, the members
of die S.G.A do not accurately represent
the student body’s political ideals. They
were not elected on political platforms and
they very seldom discuss politlcs with the
people they represent, Therefore. they are
unaware of the opinions of most of the peo~
ple whom they are supposed to represent.

Some of the S.G.A members are
politically active and aware, others are
not. Those students who are represented
by a politically conscious S.G.A. member
have a much greater voice than those
whose representatives are not politically
aware. This annihilates the possibility of
an accurate representation of the student
body and destroys the credibility of any
statement produced by the so A. which
claims to speak for the entire student
body.

At least thirty percent of the current
Grinnell student body was no way involved
with the electoral process which placed
their representatives in office. if the
S.G.A. made political statements, these
freshmen and transfer students would be
spoken for although they had no voice in
electing those who would speak for them

Using this system, if the 5 GA were In

awarded to those who have broken the law.
Hence, the scholarship fund in itself is
breaking the law, in principle. Admittedly.
ihe Solomon Amendment discriminates
against the poor male student who is
breaking the lavl. but a citizen Viho breaks
the law docs not deserve the benefits of his
government. — Sincerely yours. John N.

send a letter voicing an opinion which is
supposed to represent the entire Grinnell
College student body to a senator, for ex-
ample, the senator is certain to realize that
many of those who are represented by ihe
letter are not registered to vote ln his
district. Because of this fact the senator is,
therefore, not going to consider it as much
as he would a statement by his consti~
tuents. If he did, he would be unfair to
those who vote in hls district and rely on
his time for their representation,

A senator is going to give much more
heed to a petition with a definite amount of
signatures of people who are registered in
his district. In addition, three hundred in-
dividual letters would have an even
greater influence on him than three hun-
dred signatures on a petition which, the
senator is aware, requires much less effort
and conviction than a letter. It is obvious,
therefore, that a letter writing campaign
would be much more effective than either
a statement by the S,G.A or a petition.

The S.G.A.'s appropriate role, if the
students used such an approach, would be
to provide funding for political activities
which would benefit the students. Thls
responsibility is already taken care of by
the Political Activities Support Fund
(PAS F) The P A S F funds things in
cluding protests, speakers, and films The
funds are available to any legitimate
group regardless of the beliefs expressed
by the group. This establishes a guarantee
that all students have equal potential to ex-
press their opinions

If the S,G.A remains active in politics
only through the wise, it will allow
students [0 make the political Statements
which they have the right and the ability to
make, and it will avoid encountering the
problems of unfair representation or inef-
fectiveness, Therefore, if the students
organize letter writing campaigns and use
the P.A.S.F. effectively, they will be able
to make the most effective political
Statements
