Death Visits Grinnell

By Scott Hildula

Death visited campus recently but
rather than as an occasion to wear black
his visit inspired extra hours in the pub
and lots of laughter.

Todd Oberman. afiectionately referred
to as “Death" by former professors and
classmates. recently returned irom a Wat-
son Fellowship funded wanderjar in
Yugoslavia.

Far from dead. Oberman provided some
animated insights into the America he sees
alter 18 months spent living and travelling
behind the iron curtain.

"I had a disturbing sort of
homecoming." Oberman said. "I was
away during the election year and l was
horrified by what i saw happening to the
country."

The blind patriotism and ethnocentricity
as exhibited by the Olympics in Los
Angeles and Sarajevo really disturbed
Oberman.

“l was really bothered by the lact that
Reagan could run a Campaign on the
slogan that ‘Ii you don't vote [or Reagan
you're un-American.“ he said. "I read dur-
ing the campaigns that in surveys
everyone would agree with Mondale on the
issues but they would say. ‘I don‘t think we
can aiiord to do what he wants to do.‘ I
don't understand that. I don't see how peo
ple can not go along with what they think is
right about policy."

Oberman is highly critical of current
trends in United States Ioreign policy. He
sees ioreign policy as being too closely tied
to domestic policy.

“I couldn't believe Grenada. I couldn't
believe that people thought that it was a
good thing to do . . it just lacked such
respect and integrity for other countries."
he said.

Although it is just a small island. 0ber~
man contends that Grenada deserves the
same degree of respect that the Up‘ ate
Laches to other countries. For this reason
he thinks that the public should get upset
about such violations of state sovereignty.

“innocent people are being killed in
Latin America because 0! some CIA in-
terests." he said. "if we‘re going to go
walking around thinking that the German
people should be held responsible (or what
happened during the h aust. then we
have to face the respons' ty for what our
government does.

oberman sees the only other option lor
Americans is to diminish the German
citizenry's responsibility [or the holocaust.
He sees too great a tendency on the part of
the public to allow the goverment to act as
it pleases without holding leaders accoun-
table.

”People .oiten say. ‘We don t really
have control over our government the
government sort of does things and l m not
really responsible {or it." he said.

Such an attitude weakens a democratic
system in Oberman's view, in a
democracy you have to be responsible for
what the government does. he said

Uberman received a Watson grant to
study grass-roots political organization
and its rel tion to environmental issues in
Yugoslavia,

By Scott Hilduia

Phillip Ewoldsen will speak tonight on
“Homosexuality and Religion" as part at
“Gay Awareness Week."

Grinnell College Gay Community. Gay
Awareness Week began with a talk yester~
day‘ on gay rights and will culminate
Saturday with an all-campus post

mote thinking." Binder said. "We‘re try»
ing to make straight members of the cam-
pus community aware oi issues that con-
front gays and lesbians."

Although there is a National Gay
Awareness Week. Grinnell's week does not
