Marianne and Julianne

by Kevin O'Prey

In her third film, German director
Maragethe von rrotta explores the rela-
tionship oi twp sisters growing up in‘the
postwar Federal Republic. Von Trotta, a
dynamic force in the German cinema,
created in MARIANNE AND JULIANNE
a sophisticated, yet personal account at
the love and tension between the two
women. ‘

Based on a true story, MARIANNE AND
JULIANNE depicts the growth of two
daughters of a Protestant pastor as their
lives take radically different courses.
Julianne, the rebellious adolescent,
becomes the editor of a leftist women‘s
journal while Marianne, daddy’s little girl,
embraces terrorism and joins the Baader-
Meinhott gang, The two women dilier

radically in thElr politics, which is the
source of tension in the love they have for
one another. Marianne eventually is are
rested and found hanging in her jail cell.
Julianne. traumatized, is convinced that
her sister has been murdered and at-
tempts to set the record straight in her own
mind and with her family.

MARIANNE AND JULIANNE unfolds
in a dialectic between remembering and
forgetting, between the past and the pm,
sent, Not just a series of ﬂashbacks, the
story is one otJulianne's own memory and
teelings. Von Trotta also succeeeds in in-
corporating themes of religion, sibling
rivalry, and the burden of history telt by
the German people in the 1970s.

Carmen Jones

by Bruce Emond

In 1944, Oscar Hammerstein, one half of
the songwriting duo of Rogers and Ham-
merstein (“The King and I," “The Sound
of Music”). composed a daring version of
”Carmen," Bizet's classic opera of
obsessive love and jealousy in 19th-century
Spain. In addition to transferring the loca-
tion and period to America during World
War II, Hammerstein employed an ex-
clusively black Cast. CARMEN JONES,
the film adaptation of the longrrunning
Broadway musical, is the final selection in
the Black History Month Film Series.

CARMEN JONES is set at a Southern
military base. Dorothy Dandridge plays
Carmen Jones, and Harry Belafonte is the
handsome and gullible soldier she seduces.
In the opera, Carmen worked in a
cigarette iactory; in the iilm version,
Carmen Jones is a worker in a iactory pro»
ducing parachutes. Carmen and the
soldier are entangled in a destructive
“menage a trois” when Carmen becomes
involved with a successful boxer. When
Carmen runs off with the boxer to Chicago.
the soldier follows her there, thus setting
the stage for a dramatic, violent
showdown,

Belaionte and Dandridge, a talented,
stunningly beautiful actress who was
nonetheless relegated to stereotypical
black roles, must rank as one of the most
attractive and compatible couples ever to
appear on the screen Even without Ham»
merstein’s superlative score and the sing-
ing of Pearl Bailey and Marilyn Horne,
whose voice was dubbed for Dandridge's,
CARMEN JONES is a must-see for the
pulsating rapport of the two leads.

President’s Men

by Kevin O’Prey

With all the talk about Iran scandals and
Contra coverrups in the White House, it is
always entertaining to look back to the last
big Washington scandal (the big one) --
Watergate. Remember that one? The
players were diilerent. as were some oi
‘the scenes, but the script seems
remarkably similar There was a bad
President who did some bad things which
led the press and Congress to hang him out
to dry.

ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN, the
movie adaptation oi the bestselling book,
is a recounting of the investigative jour»
nalism of Bob Woodward (Robert Red-
ford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffr
man) of the Washington Post, Woodward
and Bernstein rose irom everyday Post
reporters to national heroes through their
determination to pursue the Watergate
scandal until the President was forced to
resign. While the Justice Department and

Congress later joined the investigation. it
was the work of Woodward and Bernstein
that made the initial breakthroughs and
drove the search to its conclusion at the top
of the executive

Filmed with a grainy, documentary-like
direction, ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN
succeeds in creating an exciting story
from one we already know. The thrill is
still there as the personal drama of Wood
ward and Bernstein’s investigation is
woven with the national fall ofa President,
The film is also superb in its depiction of
the fourth estate, the press, and the way it
works as public servant and political ac»
tor, And Deep Throat, Woodward's noctur-
nal source of information, is there too.
ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a good
film about an important period in recent
American history. Even if you know the
story. go tor the entertainment,
