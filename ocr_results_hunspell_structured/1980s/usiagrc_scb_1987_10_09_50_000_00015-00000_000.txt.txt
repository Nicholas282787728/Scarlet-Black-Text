MY
Way

by Rich Wilson
i

Aiter last week's disappointing
loss and my poor play against Lake
Forest. 1 was really excited about
coming back to Grinnell and play-
ing down on Rosenbloom. There is
a certain power or mystique about
playing at home, and I thought it
would help the team and me. Your
iriends and iamily are there, and
you tend to play better under those
circumstances

Saturday games at home start
With the same routine:

team breakiast. taping, pre-
game dress, and meetings These
activities are relatively stresseiree
and don't make me too nervous
about the game. I usually don’t get
the jitters until about ten minutes
beiore we go out ior pregame ware
mups

Last Saturday against st,
Norbert. though. l had the willies
and the butterflies from breakfast
until about the sixth play. i sat in
the locker room thinking about the
game and what i needed to do on
the ﬁeld, This is a bad habit for me
because it makes me more ner»
vous. i usually run possible game
scenarios through my mind
(caught balls. blocks, TDs, and
kickst, and if Lhére are bad plays
or dropped passes in these
scenarios, 1 usually can expect to
have a bad game. On the other
hand, the inverse is true. kind of a

> seli-iuliilling-prophecy idea. By

avoiding this “overathought”
beiore a game i am usually able to
play mnre relaxed and under less
stress. and thereiore better. It did
not work on Saturday; 1 was really
nervous.

Well, as game time drew closer,
i began to get really keyed up and
ready to play, and the nervousness
began to subside a little. Although
the jitters were few, I still had
some come kickoff time. Like I
said earlier, I could not shake them
until well after the first series of
plays, but when they leit. they
were gone tor the, game, Now I was
able to concentrate on the game
and our team.

, Well, as you have already read,
the mighty Pioneers tell to St.
Norbert 57710 in a game plagued
with miscues and misfires.

' Although we lost, 1 think it was
good to be back at home and play
ing in front of our Own sparse
crowds.

A Dark Knight
For Grinnell

5 by Walt Maley
The Grinnell iootball team came
r home last weekend to play at
Rosenbloom Stadium ior the iirst
. time in this 1937 season A powertul
;St, Norbert team proved to be
: everything it was expected to be
t and more as it deieated the home
. team 57-10. However, the score is
; not indicative oi the eiiort put out
; by the Grinnell squad. Grinnell ac-
: tually played with the Green
Knights ior a good share or the
game but was unable to punch the
ball into the endzone at critical
times This was especially evident
: in the iirst quarter. 0n the opening
kickoii, the pioneers came right
. aiter St. Norbert by attempting an
. onside kick. The knights got the
: ball and started to move down the
; iield beiore being stuiied by the
; Grinnell deiense inside the iive
yard line. The oiiense was able to
. move the ball most oi the day, but
3 in most cases they were not able to
; sustain drives long enough to
I score.

Critical mistakes hurt the team.

Three pioneer passes were picked ’

off, the ball was fumbled and lost
:once. and the team was whistled
: tor seven penalties.
3 On the positive side, the deiense
:sacked the Knight quarterback
; three times, and Paul Leschensky
2 got two of them The offense got on
:the scoreboard twice against a
tough defense. Mike Mohan booted
a 30-yard iield goal and added a
successlul FAT. Craig Whitaker.
the pioneer scoring leader, scored
his third TD oi the season on a
i7-yard pass from White, Fred
Hopkins had another good day run-
:ning hack kicks with tour ior so
_I yards. and Rich wilson caught six

 

- pass 5 (or 56 yard

This week, Grinnell welcomes

and their squad or 95 players to
Rnsenbloom tield for a 1'30 PM.
contest. Coe is the perennial

Midwest Conference powerhouse 5
who won the Southern division last

year and is trying to repeat,

Although Coe is probably a better '
team than St. Norbert. and they -

have 18 returning seniors who have
lost only one regular season game
in their career, look tor Grinnell to

give them a good game. Grinnell -

matches up much better with Coe

and will return several injured .
players to put them near loo perr '

cent ior Saturday's game. There
was a good ian turnout Saturday;
let's see it we can repeat the tu

Griffins Whooped
at Graceland

by Trevor Harris

Last weekend, the Griffins trots
led off to Lamoni to confront Kent
“Deck in the A-s" Allshnuse and
the Bar Boys of Graceland College,
The smell oi diesel from the come
bines was still in the air as we ape
preached the field of freshly Cut
straw. Beiore the game, we were
warned not to kick the ball too high
as it might get hit by planes lane
ding at the airstrip not even 100
ieet away

Lacking a reieree, Greaseland
generously sacriiiced one oi their
unbiased land ignorant and blind
and stupid and,,.) players to oi-
iiciate the game. The iirst halt
Went well, with Grinnell teaching
the rules vocally to the Bar Boys,
who apparently suiier irom severe
learning disabilities,

Grinnell gave up two penalty
kicks tsix points) to Graceless in
the first half, which pleased the
crowd oi teeny-hoppers immense-
iy. Grinnell played well, though,
much like the British troops
lighting in North Alrlca Said
hooker Simon Levin, “It was a cone
(mutation of Skill versus brute
Iorce and ignorant strength. We
were intimidated by their stupidity
and lack oi understanding. Kent, is
this rugby or backyard kill-the
carrier?"

Thoroughly infuriated, the Griir
fins came back early in the second
hali with a try made by paul
"Killer K" Kelsey. Farceland
retorted with a try later in the sea
Bond half. Later, Chrls “Crisco"
Bain, according to the rules oi the
iowa Rugby Union. should have
been awarded a try ior his attempt
at the goal line The Grassland
rules were ditierent, though, and
the other team was awarded the
ball. (Are my iaithiul and
educated readers getting the
overall picture yet”)

Several outstanding plays were
made by Kirk “Quiet Death" Mara
ty, Dan “Tarzan” Flores, Simon
“I'll beat the sh»t out oi you, any
day" Levin, Mike “The Toe"
ouimby, Matt “Hey, Baby, what
time is it?“ O‘Hearn, Skyler “Lick
that dog” Rupp, Eian “OK,
Skyler" Murphy, and Dave
”Whoops!" Gerard, John ”Crazy
Legs" Rogers also put on the
speed, uniortunately, at the party
aiter the game.

Sadly, Grinnell will lose perhaps
its best player oi the decade,
Graduate Chris Bain will be sorely
missed as he goes on to Guatemala
working ior the peace Corps. The
Griiiins wish him luck and peace
as he begins his real life the hard
way... the only way tor Chris.

This Sunday, Grinnell travels to
Newton to play Cornell College
and the Skunk River Rugby Club,

_ in the late 19705, soccer was hail-
d as the sport oi the 80s. Today
occer is being hailed as the sport
i the next century. By the year
coo, soccer will be hailed as the
port of the next millennium. Soc
er was predicted as the sport oi
the iuture based on the strong
outh programs across the coun-
try. The iounders oi protessional
American soccer leagues imagin-
ed the little wear-old iullback or
yesterday would be the 24-year-old

; paying customer oi tomorrow And

the NASL was there to satisfy the
needs of those 24~yearrold ex»
iullbacks. Surely you remember
the great teams or the NASL: the

- New York Cosmos, the Tampa Bay

I Rowdies,

the Washington
Diplomats, the San Jose Earth-

' quakes. The NASL even hired their
; own prophet, pele. to preach to all
' the chlldren that soccer was their

sport. What happened to the

' NASL? Likc Tlnkertoys and Legos,

soccer was dismissed by the

- zlyear-old as a game oi childhood
The 24ryear-old, like adults of all

previous generations, become a

NASL withered away in 1983
(although its bastard son, the
MISL, is still thriving), and the
great pole is now a pitch-man for

But the ghosts of soccer past
were long forgotten Saturday at
Grinnell College. The stands were
full, and the sidelines at Ward
Field were lined with observers.
As the tightly played game pro-
gressed, the crowd became more
hostile. Fans continually harassed
the reieree and encouraged Grin-
nell players to take out the Knox
players brutally. li Grinnell had
last, there could have been a riot
between the Grinnell fans and the
Knox tans. What happened to that
quiet peaceiul gamei Was soccer
becoming a sport? Fans were
rooting hard and becoming totally
immersed in the flow of the game.
i thought that zealous and die-hard
tans only existed at iootball,
basketball, or baseball games
Suddenly it became clear to me
that here at Grinnell, soccer is
equal to iootball and every other
sport,
