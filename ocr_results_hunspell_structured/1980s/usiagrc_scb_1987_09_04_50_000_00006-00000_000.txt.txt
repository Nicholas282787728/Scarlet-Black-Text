Chinatown

by Brian Strause

After seeing Roman Polanski’s
“Chinatown," most audience
members tend to remember the
scene in which Polanski, in a brief
appearance, slashes a switchblade
through private eye Jake Gittes‘
left nostril. Although this bit of
Violence takes place in 19305 Los
Angeles, it would be a mistake to
view this mm as a period piece.
The violence, corruption, and
pessimism that surround this film
are clearly demonstrative of the
present.

Polanski comments, “When I
was shooting this film, I was amaz-
ed sometimes, listening to the
news programs. by the parallels
between what I was hearing and
what I was shooting. Not that I am
hostile to the American systemi It
may be the only one that works
now dﬁpite all that’s wrong with
America."

Polanski has been accused of an
obsession with violence which
seems especially odd due to the
murder or his wits sharon Tate by
the Manson gang He rejects this
hypothesis by concluding that what
bothers people about his films is
the realism which surrounds the
Violence, not the Violence itself.
Somehow it seems ironic that
Polanski Chose himself to perform
the butchering of Jack Nicholson’s
nose. Polanski asks us to believe
instead that his attraction to
“Chinatown" lies in the stock of
cliches which typically surround
private-eye films. “I love the
cliches. Practically every tilm I
make starts with one. i just try to
update them . . . Great artists
always use them."

Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a
low-life private eye, recently
resigned irom the police force
because of his feelings of revulsion
for his beat in LA ‘5 Chinatown.
He nickel-andsdimes his way
through his existence by - ins
vestigating adulterous love affairs
for his clients. In a seemingly
typical investigation, Gittes is
hired by an impostor to look into
allegations that the Los Angeles
Water Commissioner is being un-
faithful to his wife. When the coma
missioner is found dead in a City
reservoir with salt water in his
lungs, Gittes iinds himself in a
situation beyond his control. The
commissioner's real wile. played
by Faye Dunaway, then hires Gite
tes to track down the murderers.
As the investigation continues, Git-
tes uncovers endless layers ol cor-
ruption which point to a criminal
plan to detraud the festering city or
Los Angeles of its precious water
supply ‘

Jack Nicholson, of course, plays
his part with the excellence which
is expected ot him. The humor he
brings to the cynical yet somewhat
naive Gittes makes it easy to
overlook the film's occasional
longrwindedness. Most important-
ly, Nicholson brings life to a
character whose essence is cliche
without establishing a complex
personality. It can be assumed that
this relative shallowness is inten-
tional, as it is reﬂective of the
character of a town which was
described by Raymond Chandler
in the 1930s as “a big hardboiled
city with no more personality than
a paper cup.”

Lolita

by Brian Strause

The critical consensus of Stanley
Kubrick’s ”Lolita" seems to lie in
its failure to remain faithful to the
essence of Vladimir Nabokov‘s
celebrated novel of the same
name. The inconsistencies stem
from the casting choices, ultimate-
ly blossoming to create a film
which follows the novel's story
line, but loses its meaning on the
way. “Lolita" tells the story of a
middle-aged European named
Humbert Humbert (James Mason)
and his lustful pursuit of a twelve
year-old “American Nymphet.” In
order to facilitate his quest for
Lolita’s tender young flesh,
Humbert marries her Widowed
mother, Charlotte Haze. Shortly
after the marriage, complications
arise which leave Lolita in the
hands of the twisted Humbert. At
this point Kubrick virtually shata
ters Nabokov’s intentional revers
53] of the Jamesian theme of
American innocence vs. European
corruption.

Naboknv's Lolita is twelve years
old. However, Kubrick opts to
abandon this shock effect by in-
stead casting a wellsdeveloped
14-year-old. Upon “Lolita’s”
release in 1962 the overwhelming
response of critics was that this
age diIIerence “moved the em.
phasis oi the plot from Humbert's
fatal passion to his fear of disap-
proving society and in particular to
his nightmare night from his rival
Quilty (Peter Sellers)."

Nonetheless, “Lolita” does have
some redeeming qualities
regardless of its decision to throw
away the formula oi its inspiration.
Kubrick effectively demonstrates
his mastery of the camera and his
sense of originality. Perhaps it
would be fair to look at this film as
a stepping stone to his more in
spired efforts, which include “The
Shining,” “Dr. Strangelove,”
“Clockwork Orange,” and “Full
Metal Jacket."

Rockers

by Sasha Aslanian

“Rockers,“ slang for reggae
music, is a low-budget Jamaican
film reminiscent but not imitative
of “The Harder They Come." It is
a glimpse into the seductive
Rastaiarian culture, one aspect of
which is beating drums, Our hero,
Leroy (“Horsemouth”) Wallace is
a drummer in a reggae band in the
tenements of West Kingston,
Jamaica. With the help or his
Rastafarian friends, Horsemouth
takes on the nasty mob that cons
trols the music industry and
becomes a type of “Rastafarian
Robin Hood." The actors are real
musicians, and the film is part fic-
tion and part documentary, The
musical score springs naturally
from the film, creating a harmony
unusual in most films.

Although it is filled with Rasta

wit and antics, “Rockers" is also
didactic about the Rastafarian
religion. In this way, the film mir-
rors an important characteristic
of reggae music: great dance
music with an impassioned
message. One scene shows the
band playing for an audience of
wealthy white tourists who are
oblivious tolhe meaning of the
music. Hmmmm. The film is a
mustsee tor reggae aficionados.
The score includes Peter Tosh's
“Steppin’ Razor.“ Bunny Wailer’s
“Rockers," Junior Murvin's
“Police and Thieves,” and Jacob
Miller’s “Tenement Yard.” The
film is in Rasta Patois with
English subtitles, so you might get
it. Friday, 9:30 P.M.. ARH
Auditorium: Sunday, 8:30 EMT,

The End of St. Petersburg

“The End of St. Petersburg" is a
silent black-an hite film com-
missioned as part of the Soviet
Revolutions lath Anniversary
cel bration. Although at the
pol cal level this film is merely
propaganda, it has been critically
well—received and respected for is
superb photography and its
“especially rousing climax.”

magazine praises the camera
