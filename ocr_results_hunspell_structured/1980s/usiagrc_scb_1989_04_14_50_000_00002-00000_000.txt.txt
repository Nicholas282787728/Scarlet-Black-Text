The First Strike is the Lucky
Strike, a work of art in William
Lawless' exhibit. “Prosthetic
Advice," was noticed missing
from its display in Fine Arts on
Saturday. April 3. Only the
name plate remains in the space
that used to contain First Sirike’s
ticclyed American flag.

Lawless said that First Strike
was meant to equate the United
States, as a multi-national
corporation, with Lucky Strike
cigarettes. He characterized the
equation as “as shared association
of fire, smoke, old money, mas-
culine imagery, American im-
agery (the perennial flag, the
thirties‘ and fortics‘ sense of
cigarette-brand value, the sixties‘
ticrdying appeal. the eighties’
image of nuclear finale) and im-
agery in transition (as the origi-
nal images have been changed,

Though no one expressed
negative comments about First
Strike directly to Lawless, one
person had inquired at the Fine
Arts Office whether First Strike
was a proper display of the
American ﬂag.

The correct use of the Amerir
can flag in art exhibits has been
called into question recently as
the result of Who Know: the
Proper Way to airplay a 11.5.
Flag.7, by Scott Tylcr, which was
part of a student display that
opened Feb. 17 at the School of
the Art Institute of Chicago.
This controversial work consisted
of an American flag laid on the
floor, with its edge reaching the
wall. A shclf on the wall held a
book in which people might
write comments. On the wall
above the book were photographs
of flag-covered coffins and burn

reach the book only by walking
on the flag.

Lawless crcatcd First Strike
two years ago and became aware
of Tyler's work only shortly be-
rorc spring break. With regard to
his own work. Lawless said.
“The show is not political. . .(it
is ironical), and the flag was not
directly intended to be political,
although literalists could cer-
tainly see it it in that way." He
added that because “first stri kc" is
also a play on SDI. he does not
deny that the work has political
associations.

Lawless asks that the flag be
rclumed.

“Prosthetic Advice" is on
display in the lobby of lhe Fine
Arts Building through April 19.
