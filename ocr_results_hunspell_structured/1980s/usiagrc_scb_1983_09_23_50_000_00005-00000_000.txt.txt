“The Student Government Association
convened an open forum to discuss the
question ‘Can Students Participate in Our
riculum Decisions?‘ in South Lounge on
November 23. President of the College
George Drake, Dean of the Faculty
Catherine Frazer, and Chairman of the
Faculty Morris Parslow attended the ses-
sion. , They assured the studean that
they planned to ask diem for their opinions
on the issue." e Grinnell Magazine Jan.,
1982.

Recalling the midnight oil burnt cranks
ing out last week’s 5&3, this cub reporter
got right to work on the next assignment.
This week I was to interview professors
about the Parslow Proposal. I began the
interviews just as the 5&8 was hitting the
streets. (Well, hitting the post office
anyway.) By the end of the second inter-
view, I was beginning to wonder if my coir
umn urging students to attend the faculty
meeting may have been a grave mistake.
The first blow came when Professor of An-
thropology Jon Andelson informed me that
the faculty would have to close the meeting
to students if too many tried to attend. It
seems there simply isn't enough room for
all of us in Science 171.

I didn’t begin to kick myself until I asked
Professor Kintner his views on student
participation in the debate He said that
formal participation on the part of
students would only be frustrating for
them, “If the studenu are involved in the
debate, you can be certain that only a few
of them will become involved, they may be
elected, they may be appointed, they may
be self appointed, but they are not going to
repraent the total range of student in-
teresB. And there always will be students

At first glance, the title of this article
probably led most of you to believe that
this would be a right-wing attack on the
Nuclear Freeze movement in light of the
Soviet downing of the ﬂight 007. on ﬁle con»
trary, it is a passionate plea for
demonstration in support of continuing the
human race beyond Cuban Crisos,
Afganistans, and Korean jet airliners.

The nuclear freeze movement in the
United States has in the last two years
become a paramount foreign affairs issue
for the President and Congress. It has also
become a major issue in the quest for the
Democratic party’s nomination, which has
seen candidates such as Alan Cranston
embrace the freeze as their sole impetus
for seeking the nomination.

A recent poll showed that 65 percent of
Americans support the freeze as a viable
solution to curtailing the nuclear arms
race. The downing of flight 007 has seems
ingly ended the freeze's thrust. The freeze
has never been supported in any form by
President Reagan, who now basks in
glorious praise of the confirmation of the
immorality and evilness of the nation
known to us as the Soviet Union. But what
really in the whole scheme of the "age of
overkill" has the downing changed? When
we take a serious look at our rather
ridiculous hostilities we can find many
such downings, Vietnam, Afganislan. the
Bay of Figs, and Poland, which have for
both sides only confirmed the vile inten-
tions Of Capitalism or hideous desrgns of
communism.

But for those who wish to look at the
world as either black or white. whether
liberal or conservative, lhcre is no Issue
that better presents itself for cold logical
evaluation than the nuclear freeze.
Nuclear defense In the U S, relies on the
theory of deterrence. simply put. the
Soviet Union will not din'elaunch a nuclear
atlack against this country because lo do
so would elicit 3 Similar reaction from us;
the term used for this stalemate is Mutual
Assured Destruction or MAD for short.
Both the US, and the Soviet Union both do
pend on the premise of MAD to assure
their safety.

The arms race started when the US,
who had sole possession of atomic
weapons, decided to produce these
weapons. or course, the Soviet Union had
to have a defense of similar proportions
and had to follow suit in developing their

who will say ‘that’s not what i think. . . and
I'm not being represented‘.”

l began to ask myself how could students
effectively participate in this important
curriculum decision.

in terms of power, the students are

‘ clearly have-hots, There are a number of

institutional structures through which
students can express dieir opinions, but
ultimately whether or not Grinnell adopts
a set of requirements will be decided by a
vote of the faculty. Students should be
aware of this power dynamic in choosing
their mode of participation,

With little or no legitimate power, at-
tempts to persuade the faculty are more
likely to be effective than any form of con-
frontation. Further remarks made by Pro-
fessor Kintner suggest some possibilities,
“I think that students may very well have
important suggestions to make at times.
And I think their Suggestions can better be
made through their normal paths of pro-
viding information: talking with in-
dividual faculty [and] having conferences
with them in ﬁle halls.”

Kintner's idea of conferences could take
the form ofstudy breaks, organized by the

Curriculum :

dorms, the departmental EPC‘s or some
other group. This would provide a non-
confrontational atmosphere where a few
professors could exchange ideas with
small groups of students. These direct
lines of communication between students
may be the most effective means of having
a part in the decision.

Another possibility for action lies within
the existing bureaucratic structure. The
Curriculum Council, which consists of
represeniaiim from each department's
Student Education Policy Committee, is
charged with the duty of discussing "mat-
ters of general curricular interest." Thus
contacting your EPC representative is one
way of registering your opinion.

In addition to the Curriculum Council,
there is a Curriculum committee which in»
cludes four members of the ()irriculum
Council. This is a joint studentrl‘aculty
committee, and the student members are
to be chosen this week.

The Student Government Association
has also shown interest in the issue. They
have formed an ad hoc committee to
generate an organized student response to
the requirement proposal, and plan to
distribute a questionnaire to students in
the near future.

What Price Nuclear Freeze

first atomic weapons We can all unders-
tand that the US, would then probably
want to develop a new super weapon. 1
hope that we are all not too ethnocentric to
understand that the Soviet Union, in die in
teresm of their own defense, would want to
develop their own nuclear weapons,

So here we have arrived at our problem:
when does a country feel that it has
developed its MAD defenses enough to stop
developing nuclear weaponsi The answer
is that they don't! Because nuclear war is
so repugnant to both the us. and the
USSR, with the consequences being the
destruction of life as we know of it today,
wars are fought by armies of statisticians
who determine to the best of their
knowledge, what is an adequate MAD
system or what constitutes a “window of
vulnerability. And because each person
(conservatives and liberals) has his own
definition of what is safe and what is not,
we still cannot seem to agree that we have
over done,

Yes, \ve can blow up the Soviet Union
and the world ten times over, but we still
need the MX, supposedly to slam shut the
window of vulnerability But how many
times have we shut that window only to
find that the statisticians have decided
that there is again a crack in the window
that some billion dollar missile will help

Shut. There is no window of vulnerability
Even if the Soviet Union were able to
knock out every land based nuclear
missile in the U.S. without any retaliation
(and this presumption IS absolutely
preposterous, but let's leave it in for the
fun of the ‘age of overkill') US. nuclear
submarines and aircraft bombers armed
with nuclear devices could still destroy
Moscow and Leningrad and hundreds of
other Russian cities; that is deterrence 7
that is the essence of MAD.

Korean jet airliners do not change MAD,
they are only side issues. The MX or Per-
shing missiles will not prevent incidents
such as Afganlstan or downed jet airliners
nor will Soviet sszfls prevent Bay of Figs
or E1 Salvadors. Would you approve of this
country ending the human race because of
a downed airliner? To use a cliche; there
are no winners in nuclear war, only losers,
But why, if this is such a cliche, or come
mon knowledge, do we continue playing
the game" The nuclear freeze movement
acknowledges the game and, in a sense,
plays by the rules only smarter.

Nuclear freeze is a verifiable bllateral
agreement to stop the dcvclopmciil and
production of any more nuclear weapons.

An alternative means for students to ex-
press lheir opinions would be for a body
such as the SGA to hold a public hearing. A
public hearing would differ from an open
forum in that it would be designed so that
students would have the opportunity to
take the floor and express their views,
whereas an open forum usually focuses on
questioning a college official. The ideas
that are expressed at the public hearing

could be recorded and presented to the
faculty.

Whatever means we devise, whether it is
speaking privately to a professor or
holding a public meeting of some kind,
well thought out philosophical and praCr
tical arguments are most likely to sound
persuasive to faculty members. confron-
tation should probably be saved as a last
resort

But the cub reporter still hasn‘t dealt
with what to do about this faculty meeting.
I still think I would urge all interested
students to attend, but perhaps we should
all sit quietly and let the faculty fight the
first round among themselves, saving our
breath for occasions when we can be most
effectively persuasive. Let us hope that we
can all squeeze into Science 171,

any more new toys into the already futile
game. The nuclear freeze will not make
the world any safer really, because there
will still be enough weapons to end life on
both sides, but the freeze will put an end to
the delusions on either side that there is
any finish line except mutual annihilation
for the arms race. MAD is preserved, the
generals and the Pentagon remain. and
the status quo remains, but we no longer
waste billions of dollars on the inane, You
see, this is a capitalist argument, the arms
race is too expensive and inefficient a use
