“efficient , effective” SGA

“Hopefully, we can offer enough good
services and be efficient enough in our
procedures that we Will be an effective

students," commented the Student
Government Association President
Paul Volker Volker, along with his
cabinet. plan to meet the issues facing
Grinnell College with such an SGA.
Volker sees two major issues facing
the students of Grinnell and con-
sequently the SGA in the 1980781 school
year. "People perceived me as running
for two different purposes when I ran
for office. Foremost probably, I think
my constituency believed that it I were
SGA president I would be able to cut
through some of the problems other
SGA presidents have had,” said Volker.
The lirst and most important
problem the new cabinet will have to
face is the poor and repetitious quality
of the Joint Board meetings. “ , in the

past they (Joint Board members) too
often have argued about trivial things.

thing, while another would stand up and

SGA approves reformed budget

The Grinnell Book, which has been on
shaky ground for the last two years.
received a critical blow at the Student
Government Assembly on Wednesday
night. The yearbook's allotted $1700
from SGA was placed into a reserve
Iund under SGA’s control, The action,
amended by Peter Elonsky, was
spurred by the yearbooks inability to
sell itself.

Vice President John Conyers said the
Grinnell Book had been sold to only 25
percent of the students. He added that
the yearbook of two years ago was such
a high school production that students
have since been hesitant to invest in a
poor product. Although the amendment
was greeted with great disapproval by
Pam Hulnick, U18 assembly decision
was to put the Grinnell Book and its
$1700 into reserve. This means that the
staff must have the permission of SGA
and the Student Publications and Radio
Committee before any of the money
may be spent.

Also revealed at the aseernbly was
the failure of the refrigerator rental
drive to make a profit. During
questioning by Bill Stowe, Student
Coordinator Anna Marie Campbell an-
nounced that the refrigerator rental

The primary goal of the cabinet is to
combat this Vice President John
Conyers commented “If we as a
cabinet come to the Joint Board
meetings as prepared as possible and
make our points as succinctly and
precisely as possible we can set a good
example lor good discussion.” At the
first meeting of the Joint Board earlier

encouraged" by their attitude.

Grinnell’s severe budget problem is
the second area of concern for the new
cabinet. Though Grinnell has an en-
dowment of approximately $110 million,
the student activities fee (if $89,425 has
remained the same for the past two
years, Though the amount is the same,
inﬂation has lowered it. “In fact." said
Volker, “it's been devalued more than
you would expect because the things we
spend money on are extremely inﬂation
sensitive.” Volker pointed out that
inﬂation of concerts and Illms, as well
as the cost of transportation. has been

communication with the rental service
as to how many and what size
refrigerators to order. In the past the
refrigerator drive has always been a
source of profit for the SGA. The ex-
pected profit of $200 had already been
included in the income category of the
previously devised budget.

After much discussion the problem
was resolved. President Paul Voker
summarized the problem and solution
in a few words. “Refrigerator income
zeroed, thus forcing an increase in
activity fee of $200,” Volker explained
that the activity fee required as a part
of the tuition was not being increased,
but SGA was merely counting the fact
that they had underestimated the
number of students to attend Gl'innell
this year.

A proposal to take $575 from the
college radio station KDIC was vetoed.
but a friendly amendment was soon
passed. The assembly agreed to take
$230 away from KDIC The major
reason cited was that KDIC had given
employees raises while other
organizations and their employees
were forced to take decisive cuts.
Volker noted that KDIC had been
allotted an abundance of capltal.

Only two other minor budgetry
transactions took place. One hundred

of inﬂation. “We‘re faced with trying to
spend our money so that we continue
the important social programs that we

said Volker. As a result, Volker and his
cabinet plan to make the best of what
they have, “We (the cabincti think
that things can be done to the budget
we have presently that will make a
more equitable way of dispensing
money throughout the campus groups,
both large and small," claimed Volker.
He plans to accomplish this by keeping
a close watch on lunding requests and
general expenditures.

Conyers pointed out that first
semester the cabinet is dealing with a
Joint Board tllat has not dealt with the
budget previously. Therefore, he ad-
ded, “Our goal is to implement the kind
of budgetary processes we‘d like to see
second semester because we feel we
have time to prepare the resources and
get in touch with Joint Board mem—
bers.”
