Tenure becomes a topic of discussion
Exec. Council vetoes Magurshak’s recommendation

by Anne Rawland and Steve Way

Last Friday. Jan, 29. President George
Drake informed protessor Dan Magurshak
he would not be recommended to the
Board of Trustees for tenure. Drake made
his announcement after reviewing the Ex
ecutive Council's negative decision on
Magurshak's tenure proposal.

Magurshak. who serves as assistant pro-
lessor ot philosophy, replied by sending a
letter ot appeal to the council on the follow
ing Monday. At this writing the council had
yet to make any statement concerning the
appeal,

After receiving his doctorate from Nor-
thwestern University in Evanston. Ill .
Magurshak came to Grinnell in the fall of
l976. Since coming here Magurshak has
not only served as a protesscr but also as a
tutorial adviser. In addition he has sat on

,s’everal of the college‘s numerous commit
tes,

News of the rejection came as a shock to.

those involved. including Magurshak
himseil, Department Chair Jack Worley.
department member Susan isen and
Philosophy EPC chairman Drake
Jackson. "If they don't want Dan I don‘t
know who they do want." said Worley

Isen was rumored to be considering
resigning. liowever. when contacted lsen
declined to substantiate or deny the rumor
until the appeal process is complete

Worley testified that the required infor-
mation in the tenure review package shed
a lavorabie light on Magurshak, The
packet consists cl 1) teaching evaluations
conducted by the student EPC supported
by a summary of the end oi course evalua-
tions for Magurshak's classes; 2t an
evaluation of Magurshak‘s scholarly
works; 3| letters from three committee
chairs regarding Magurshak's contribu
tion to the community. Jackson. who coorr
dinated the student input concerning
Magurshak's tenure recommendation, in»
terviewed so philosophy students and EPC
members — all but one of whom recom»
mended that Magurshak be promoted to
Associate Professor with. tenure.

Worley streesed the praise Magurshak
received in all three areas. He also pointed
out the scholarly evaluation came from
Calvin O. Schrag. a noted scholar in
Magurshak‘s field. rather than from
within the college. as is customary. Worley
said Magurshak's works were sent away
because no one at Grinnell is qualified in
Magurshak's field. In addition. Worley
noted Magurshak independently sent his
works to two other scholars who concurred
with Schrag.

Included with the required information
was a favorable letter from Ray Obers
miller, director of Academic Advising. and
a letter of commendation from a Grinnell
taculty member who called on Magurshak
to give a guest lecture to one ot his German
classes.

According to Worley. after reviewing the
packet both the department and the divi-
sion sent unanimous and strong recom-
mendations supporting Magurshak to the
Executive Council. However, Drake as
well as members of the Council declined
comment while the appeal is pending.

"They (Council members) are sworn to
secrecy." said Worley. “We know not on
what the decision pivoted. but we'll know
at the appeaL" ...

said. "There was no great debate at the
division meeting ” However. he clarified
the decision-making process by noting.
"It‘s fairly customary tor a unanimous
recommendation from the department and
the division on tenure proposals. The
trustees removed the tenure quota a cou-
ple of years ago. but in doing so expected
Careful decisions on tenure."

Magurshak altered only guarded com»
ments but promised to write an open letter
to the campus upon completion or the ap-
peal process "1 don't want to muddy the
waters." he said However. he did offer. “I
tind it incredibly puzzling how strong stu-
dent. departmental and divisional recom~
mendations could go into the Executive
Council and come out negative." He went
on. "Philosophers are trained to consider
all possibilities but i can't coherently put
together any possibilities in this case "

Harold Kassimow. Associate Prolessor
of R ligious Studies and a member of the
Div on Committee which heard Magur-
shak's case said. “I was taken completely
by surprise by the council's decision." He
added, "I do not agree with the council."
“I‘ve studied on the university level for 25
years and i think Dan's teaching is lirst
rate." said Kassimow "I have even had
Dan come in to teach my class." When
asked how other faculty members felt
Kassimow replied. "The very rew faculty
I've spoken to teel very much as I do. they
seem very surprised."

Isen and Worley echoed Kassimow‘s
statements. "Grinnell is dedicated to ex
cellence in teaching and dedication to the
college." said isen. "I think Dan exr
emplifies those things." Worley explained
that choosing Magurshak involved par-
ticipation by the EPC. He claimed that at
the time they went to a conference to look
over candidates they chose the best in the
tield. According to Worley. Magurshak
was at the top of the list

EPC chairman Jackson will meet with
President Drake on Feb, 16. the day before
Magurshak's appeal is heard. ”The point

strongly recommended him." Jackson
said. “The problem with the whole issue is
that Dan was unanimously voted for
tenure. not only by students but by the
philosophy department and by professors
outside the philosophy department." He
continued. “The question is. why was he
not tenured? It is a tenure track position
and it he was strongly recommended. what
happened? idon't know."

Jackson said the report that his Commit-
tee sent to the Executive Council contained
high praise irom all sides tor Magurshak.
some students calling him a "true
scholar." a “genius" and there was a
universally supported view or him as a
protessor or high caliber.

"The philosophy department as it stands
now is solidified in the sense that the pro-
lessors in it respect each other's
disciplines — they don't tread on each
other's grounds." Jackson said. “They
create a very harmonious department and
it's ditlicult to see what would happen
without Dan there."

Given the [act that President George
Drake and Dean of the Faculty Catherine
Frazer oppose a quota for the number or
prolessors allowed to be tenured 7 many
philosophy students and a number at pro-
fessors are speculating that the tenure
denial is rooted in political or personal
grounds.

Jackson said that what otten happens
when a professor has been on a tenure
track tor several years and does not have
his contract renewed is that he suddenly
finds his career to be over. The job market
for liberal arts professors with doctorates
is so flooded that the philosophy depart.

opening of an assistant professorship
which Daniel Graham filled In 1980.

“When you‘re talking about a school like
this you're lirst obligation is to find a good
teacher." said Worley. “Most well
qualified people in Dan‘s field teach at big
universites where they only have to teach
one graduate course and then do scholarly
work " he continued. "The probability of

 

finding someone‘else like Dan is Zilch‘in .

Tenure:
a long process.

by Ellen Heath

One of the Webster's Dictionary‘s defini-
tions of tenure is a status granted alter a
trial period to a teacher protecting him
lrom summary dismissal.

Based on a description at tenure by Dean
of Faculty Catherine Frazier the above
definition is not entirely Correct There is.
at Grinnell and most colleges. a trial
period (or teachers but tenure was
originally devised as a "device tor
guaranteeing academic freedom in the
classroom." according to Frazier. Tenure
protected the protessor who espoused un-
popular Or unorthodox beliefs in his
classroom lrom being punished tor
teaching those beliefs Frazier thinks the
original reason is still the main purpose to
day.

At Grinnell College tenure is based on a
Series of recommendations A teacher is
hired for a probationary period and alter a
certain appointment. usually six years. the
question oi tenure may be decided

The tenure decision must be a positive
one. that is. there must be a speciiic
reason for a recommendation to confer
tenure upon a teacher. As Frazier said. "It
is not a case where someone should be
tenured if there's no reason not to "

Recommendation begins with the
teacher's department Colleagues and the
student Educational Policy Committee
evaluate the teacher. The next recummen~
dation comes (ruin a divisional committee

made up ot senior faculty members fromr

each division An executive council‘then
advises the president of the college who
makes the final recommendation to the
Board of Trustees Presented with a
recommendation from the president. the
trustees may then confer tenure upon the
teacher, Frazier stressed that the decision
is not made by only one group or people but
by the college as : tommunity.

According to Frazier. the criteria for
tenure. in order or importance are ex»
cellence in teaching. scholarly growth and
service to the college, she pointed out that
the emphasis in criteria varies with (life
lereiit colleges.

Somewhere along the line an evaluation
group may decide not to make the recom-
mendation. In that case. the teacher may
appeal the decision of no recommendation.
Grinnell has two avenues of appeal though
most institutions have only one, The
teacher can either apply directly to the ex
ecutlve council or to a special appeals
board which is set up specifically tor that
purpose, Frazier called the appeals pro-
cess a "due process guarantee." The ex-
ecutive council and appeals board are pro-
cedural checks and do not merely
reevaluate the decision.

If a teacher is not recommended to the
Board of Trustees for tenure he faces the
decision to leave then or stay for the suc-
ceeding academic year Afterwards it is
expected he will lind employment
elsewhere. Frazier called this practice
"notice of decision." The dean also said
that not getting tenure at one school does
not necessarily inhibit a teacher from
gaining employment at another.

At present. about 60 percent of the col
lege‘s teachers are tenured. Grinnell has
