THE PUNJAB AGITATION

In September 1931. a Sikh
religious faction, still well in the
minority (even in the State of Punr
jab) called the Akali Dal from the
state oi Punjab, presented 45
demands to the Union Govern
ment in New Delhi. (It is evident
that not all the Sikhs were. or are,
part oi the agitation),

These demands and citations
termed as “ridiculous" by most
governmental and non-
governmental people. included!

With great difficulty it is
acknowledged that one could
assert that any of thae demands
were sufficient cause [or the
subsequent militant agitiation,
The Government of India would
not concede to the demands. for
such a concession would have set
a dangerous precedence for iacs
tions in other States. Further, the
ambiguity of the demands propos»
ed by the Akali Dal and their lack
of cooperation in negotions gave
them little credence. In addition,
this radical Sikh movement

It has been noted that the State
of Punjab is the most prosperous
State in the country. Punjab pro-

agricultural output and prides
itself with much of die heavy and
light industry. Punjabs (Sikhs and
Hinus for the State) are Well
established in trade aiid com-

that the proponents of the Akali
Dal Sikh agitation were basically
anti-social elements whose lack oi
initiative in taking advantage of
the properity in Punjab. and
dreams oi a separate State, called
Khalistan, lead them to various
grotesque acts of violence and terr

felt mat she had no choice but to
resort to military action. On June
2. 1934, the Army killed about 400
Sikh militants. The Army also
reported a high number oi losses
within its own ranks.

Though iew Sikhs are said to be
partial to the militant organizar
tion. the Sikhs as a community
had condemned Gandhi‘s acu‘ons.

The remnants of the Akali Dal
then retaliated by threatening to
assassinate Gandhi. Though the
exact details are unclear, it is con-
ﬁrmed that two of her personal
Sikh security men shot her at least
four times in the abdomen 'hles

Gandhi died shortly afterwards

Due to this outcome. the Akali
Dal faction may have lost
whatever public sympathy it had
for its cause.

COMTEMPORARY POLITICS

Rajiv Gandhi has been sworm
in as the new Prime Minister and
is in the process of choosing his
cabinet. This however, is only for
an interim period lasting until the
official elections are held in
January, 1985. It is possible that
Mr. Gandhi will postpone the elec-
tions [or six months, to con
solidate his own position and to
ward oii the opposition. which
might find this an excellent oppor»
tunity to undermine Indira Gan»
dhi‘s Congressl Party.
