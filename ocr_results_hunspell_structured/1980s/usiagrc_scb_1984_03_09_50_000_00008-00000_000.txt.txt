Off campus study revisited

In this space last week a number of students presented reflections on

their off-campus study experiences.

They expressed some or the pleasures oi off-campus study to diiierent
lifestyle. extended travel or prolonged inebriation) as well as some ot its
negative aspects (a poorly run program. contact with inhospitable
cultures or prolonged lnebriationl. This week we conclude the series
\\ ilh stories on France. Scotland and Japan.

Nantes is nice

Nantes is to miles away irom
the Atlantic Ocean on the
Southernmost corner of Britialny
on the banks of the Loire River
The lnstltute 0! European Studies
program there was reasonably
well run

The port oi Nantes became a
hub oi economic activity as early
as the l'dth century. and became a
center of political activity in
medieval times 7 a mote-
enclosed castle remains. Nantes'
ship building industry eventually
involved her in 17th century slave
trade. The well-decorated
"brokerage houses" are vestiges
of this era.

Many parts oi Nantes were
heavuy bombed during World
War II. and many older
“Nantais” have Vivid memories
of this incident. Nantes used to be
called “France's Venice” before
the Loire was pushed into one
channel. and before the Elbe.
which runs into the Loire. was tunr
nelled under the city

The road which runs down the
Ellie‘s ancient streambed is calls
ed the ”Boulevard of 50 Hostages”
because it was on this road that 50
French men were killed in
repraisal tor the assasiiiation oi a
Nazi General in 1942. Ironically.
the Germans built this road 10
years beiore. as part of their pay
ment of a war debt. in brief.
Nantes is an interesting historical
set 7 like almost any other Euro»
pean city.

IES Nantes has not gained the
reputation oi being a case oi off»
campus ”nonrstudy" as some
other programs have. Depending
on your priorities time can be
found to do “extracurricular" ac
tivities. Nevertheless. courses at
the Institute are serious. Most
professors are good. The classes
were geared towards Americans.
not only because an effort was
made by the staff to speak slowly
and clearly. but also because
course material was quite ap-
ollcable to our situation.

The course .on Frances
American relations. for example.
gave us an idea oi what events are
responsible ior many French peo-
ple's attitudes towards
Americans in general. I think
that Western Foreigners are
treated well by the town popula
tion. Many Nantais told me that
their town ls “bourgeois” and I
would have to agree with them.

Many Parisian “hommes d’af—
faires" and industrialists have
been attracted to this small
metropolis which is warm. close
to the ocean and less hectic than
Paris, This immigration
demonstrates a common
phenomenon in France where
political and economic power is
highly centralized: the big in-
dustrlal and agri-business capital
invested in peripheral regions
such as Brittainy is in the hands ol
companies based in the Parisian
area. At times inhabitants of Brit-
tainy have gone so tar as to call
this imbalance of power “internal
colonialism."

There are quite a few things to
do entertainment-wise in Nantes.
Concerts such as the Police and
Peter Gabriel came through while
I was there and museums. movie
theaters. classical and jazz cons
certs and Breton Cultural festivals

.were common in the region,

Good. relatively inexpensive
retaurants. which although very
inexpensive. make Quad and
Cowles food seem like exotic
gourmet cuisine. It a monthly sti-
pend oi several hundred extra
dollars happens to come your way
to blow on clothes. liquor and
other French specialities. as it
did. i would say ior about two
thirds oi the students on the pro
gram. have no iear. Nantes is the
periect city ior a “neat” little
cosmopolitian experience, and
with the exchange rate so high.
everything is a bargain.

If you're into Seeing what the in-
digenous population is like. the
cafes are a good place to start.

ing an American is by no means a
handicapt but like many other
Northern parts oi France. they
tend to be lukewarm until you get
to know them.

Classes at the University are
worth taking ii only to know what
it is like to be a student in the
French University system. The
University is the prime place to
meet people. The Institute makes
an eiiort to expose the students to
French people. but can attract
people who consider it very chic to
have a friend from the land of big
cars and John Wayne.

Catholic and conservative. This
type oi exposure can be beneiicial
as I know it was [or many people.
but it can also be one-sided. For
example. one organization called
“FrancerAmerica” held a
Thanksgiving dinner [or uS in a
hall where American flags were
all over the walls and I had an in-
teresting conversation with a
gentleman happy that America
had finally “done something”
about Communism by invading
Grenada.

The institute also organizes
some excursions at the beginning
of each semester. Nantes is ﬂlree
hours irom Paris. and an 18 hours
train and ferry ride to London. If
you are on a tight budget. and still
want to see some beautiiul sights.
Brittainy is the place to be. Some
remnants oi ancient agricultural
practices can still be found. and
the coast rivals anything that New

be an excellent way to meet peas

Academically. the program was

make — ii you like speaking

homogeneous group of friendly
“IESers”. so be it. Otherwise. it's
a good idea to captialize on every
Contact you make. and by the end
oi your stay. you'll probably be
impressed by how hospitable peo-

- pie in Nantes can be.

T he Joy Of Japan

by Andrew Reeves

As with most of the off-campus
study programs. the Japan
Studies Program at Waseda
University in Tokyo is not as
academically demanding as Grin»
nell. But at course. the point is not
to go bury yourseli in a library in
another country. but to get outand
meet people and learn the
language. And the program offers
an excellent chance to do just
that.

with that philosophy in mind. I
set out to learn Japanese in the
bars. on the Waseda Kendo ta
form of martial art) team. and in
my family. Learning in the bars.
while a good tactic for practicing
gutteral Japanese. got to be a lit-
tle rough on my liver, The Kendo
team was good. but we usually
ended up in a bar.

Family life was by far the most
rewarding aspect of the program.
Instead of living in an apartment
by yourself. or with other Grinnell
students (God forbidl). the pro-
gram places you in a real live
home iull oi real live people.

The home stay is perennially
the biggest hit of the program.
and for good reasons. It includes
real food. a nice bed. usually there
are cute little host sisters or host
brothers. and it affords one the

chance to live like a Japanese. Of
course. it also includes real live
mothers who say. “No! It’s too
late to go out now! Stay in!" or
”Why did you come in so late last
night?" Even in Japan you hear.
“CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM!"
Some things don't change no mat-
ter where you are.

Beyond that. we had a number
of chances to travel in and out of
Japan. Some folks went to China;
1 went to Singapore with my host
brother and sister. All of us spent
some time running around the
countryside like drunk Banshees
in a Windstorm, And there is more
to do in Tokyo than' anyone could
do in several lifetimes; if you are
bored on the Waseda program. it’s
your own fault.

Classes? Oh yeah. there are
some. They are in English. at
Waseda’s International Division.
After you commute an hour or So
to school 7 studiously avoiding
the rush hour 7 you get to listen to
Japanese teachers trying to teach
you in a language foreign to them.
There are a few American
teachers as well. All the classes
are East Asian Studiestype oi
things. not surprisingly and i
found the obligatory Japanese
class extremely helpiul in staying
alive,
