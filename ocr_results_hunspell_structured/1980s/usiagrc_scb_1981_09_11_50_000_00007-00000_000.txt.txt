by Rick Richardson

Looking to bounce back from last year's
letdown, the 1981 women's tennis team
leaturos a new coach, a mixture oi return-
lng veterans and promising freshmen,
greater team mobility, and most impor
tantly, a positive outlook on the upcoming
season,

The new coach, John Harvey, is also head
coach of the men's basketball team,
Harvey assumed the post last June, ﬁlling
the void left by former tennis coach Anna

"Still youthful and inexperienced but
bigger and deeper " That’s Coach Ed Dom»
hrowski's assessment as he prepares his
Grinnell College football team for the 1981
campaign.

“We'll be better," said Dombrowski,
who hopes to improve on the 177 and Hi
records posted by his first two Grinnell
teams. The law unit topped Chicago, 21-13,
tor its only victory,

Dombrowski's 58»man squad, his largest
at Grinnell, includes 25 lettermen Many of
them were starters a year ago but several
have been shifted to new positions this fall.

The offensive veterans are ends Tom
Hanseter, Craig Rasde and Dave Smiley,
tackles Marc Conterato and Rick Jaacks;
guards Gene Anderson, Jesse Mueller and
Mitch Rows, center Erik Hanson; quarter
backs Jon Scharff and Joe Walsh; halfback
Gene Reid; fullback Mark Kohlmann, and
wingbacks Mike McCrary and Jeff
Schmidt

Defensive letterwinners are ends Steve
Connor and Scott Suter; tacklers Greg
Moore and Clayton Parks: middle guards
Mike Cetina and Harry Bullerdiek; and

Wack's retirement, Although he has never
coached women's tennis belore, Harvey is
no stranger to either the sport or the
gender, havmg taught tennis on the high
school level and coached women's basket
ball at Radcliffe

However, he plays down his role as an in-
structor and attempts to not “overcoach,”
saying that his players “don‘t need it." So
while part of the team’s practice consists of
conditioning and drills using automatic ball

machines. the bulk is devoted to “just let-
ting uie girls hit and hit and hit,” says
Harvey.

Since he only saw one of the lady
Pioneers' matches last season, Harvey's
first task uiis year was to get acquainted
with his players. Though the exact rank-
ings were uncertain at press time, Harvey
named returning veterans Nina Cerfolio,
LIZ Calhoun, Cathy Welty, and Melissa
Sobalvarro as likely to compete for the top
spots. He also referred to freshmen Sara
Weatherly and Laura Schoenbaum as
good prospects" to “be among the regular
players."

A significant and positive change lrom
last season's squad will be the mobility ol
this year's team, which will provide lor
competition among a greater number or
players. Last year's team was “static,"
with a set lineup of participants and lew
intrasquad challenge matches. According
to Harvey, challenge matches will make
this year’s squad more flexible and provide
an incentive for players to move up in rank-
lng,
