incident, In an interview the
house members admitted to
throwing eggs into the street but
not to hitting any vehicles.
Student Affairs neidter conﬁrms

action is being taken as a result
of the egging,

In addition, Physical Plant's
report complains of deer heads on
the porch of KEG House as well
as one "on the front yard with the

”We went deer hunting and
shot a couple of deer—legally,"
Fairchild explained. He said that
he had placed the deer parts in the
garbage and that dogs had
probably removed them.

The report from Physical
Plant further claims that KEG
House members would excrete
human waste in common areas of
the house, “There has been no
rcspcct shown to housekeeping.
Students would have bowel
movements on the floor in the
hallway and the bathroom and
then proceed to step in it.“ the

When asked about this

feces that were probably from the
ferret kept in the house, but
concerning human cxcrcmcnt he
said, “I have no idea."

House members maintained
that what custodial Staff believed
was human waste was actually
malted-milk balls spilled on the
floor.

Regarding the complaint of
possession of an unauthorized
animal, the Jan. 13 report stated
that “there was a ferret in the

house which the students let run
loose and there would be animal
waste all over the house...lt was
our understanding that they were
told by Student Affairs to get lhe
ferret out of the house." The
house members insisted that the
ferret was removed as instructed.
Another allegation has led to
charges of parking violations and
possession of combustible
materials. According to the
report, “A motorcycle was parked

Alum defends standardized tests

Despite a recent ﬂurry of
criticism of standardized college
admissions tests, College Board
President Donald M. Stewart
maintains that testing
organizations are constantly
working to guarantee impartiality
in standardized exams.

The 1959 Grinnell College
graduate, well-known ror
speaking out against charges of
ethnic and gender biases inherent
in standardized tests, said at a
recent news conference, “Students
across this land do not enjoy
equal educational opportunities or
equal social and economic advan-
tages. The challenge for America
is to create a level playing ﬁeld
so that students from the most
diverse backgrounds will have an
equal chance to benefitfully iron
the educational process.”

Stewart‘s remarks were made
two weeks ago, when The
College Board joined five other
educational testing organizations
in unveiling a new code of
practices that commits them to
strive for fairness in tests given
to students of different races,
genders, and ethnic' backgrounds.
The Code of Fair Testing
Practices in Education also
commits the testtnakers to review
and revise questions “to avoid
potentially insensitive content or
language," and to offer
“appropriately modiﬁed forms of
tests“ to the handicapped.

Just a few days after the Code
of Fair Testing Practices in
Education was announced, The
College Board and the American

Council on Education together
called for an end to thc “hype"
over school ratings based
primarily on how well incoming
students score on college entrance
exams, The College Board said
undue emphasis on such rankings
is causing some college-bound
students to mistakenly think they
won't be accepted at universities
with high standardized test scores
or to overlook fine colleges
whcrc test scores are lower.

“Test results are only one
indicator of the quality of
incoming students, and the
quality of incoming students
docs notncccssarily say anything
useful about the quality of what
goes on in a college or univer-
sity," the two groups said in an
open letter to schools and
education officials

“Students should be looking
at institutions because they want
to be there, not because they’re
No. l on a bloody chart,“
Stewart said later, “The whole
teaching and learning processes
are being distort

Stewart served its president of
Spelman College from 1976 to

l986, then was named president
of The College Board, a New
York-based organization of 2,500
high schools and colleges that
sponsors the Scholastic Aptitude
Test and assists students in the
transition from high school to
college.

Before j ing the
administration at Spelman,
Stewart served as executive
assistant to the president and later
as associate dean of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences and director
of the College of General Studies
at the University of
Pennsylvania.

Stewart graduated from
Grinnell College with honors in
1959. He earned an MA. degree
from Yale University, and
received Master of Public
Administration and Doctor of
Public Administration degrees
from Harvard University.

Currently a member of
Grinnell’s Board of Trustees,
Stewart is also a trustee of the
institute of International
Education and the Martin Luther
King, Jr., Center for Social
Change.

Dougherty explained that
vehicles may not be parked
“anywhere besides the parking
lots." Crady added, “For us,
combustible material would in-

. cludc a motorcycle being in a

house.”

KEG House defends itself by
calling school policy ambiguous.
“The student handbook says
(motorcycles) can‘t be parked in
the dorms or in loggias. and it
says the maximum would be a
$35 ﬁne," sophomore Stephen
Fairchild said. “ And‘nowhcre in
the contract (does it mention)
combustible materials. It says
explosives.“ Murphy, the owner
of the motorcycle, said all the oil
and gas was drained before he
brought it into the house.

On Jan. 13, the house
members met with Crady and
were informed of the action being
taken. “A group draws into a
house as a group, and they’re
responsible as a group for the
house,“ Ci'ctdy said.

"We thought we were going
to lose our maid service at
worst," said Fairchild. “That'd be
all right. We wouldn't have to

“There was no innocent until
proven guilty. it was just
straight guilty," Murphy said.
After the removal of KEG
House occupants from 1221
Park, the house will be ‘icleancd,
assessed and checked out" and
then opened to students awaiting
room changes, said Crady.
“We're going to open it to
regular people again, (those) on
the roomrchange list,” he said.

Daugherty explained the
action taken by Student Affairs:
“Generally our philosophy is
such that we would rather see
students stay together and work
things out and live with the
consequences of the damage to
the house they live in. If it gets
scvcrc cnough, I think that we
need to be able to take steps. I
think in this case after assessing
the total, the whole, all that had
gone into the house. we felt that
this was the best thing for the
house and in general for the
campus," she said.

“We’re acting like real people out
in the real world," he said, “and
they don‘t want us to.“
