Branstad, Evans win by strong margin
Incumbents "all re-elected in off-year

by Brad Vander Linden

The election ol1982 produced the highest
voter turnout in Iowa of any non-
presldential year, drivmg the total number
who actually voted to one million, almost
two-thirds of those eligible to go to the polls
on Tuesday. The results of Tuesday's
voting were full ofsurprises that confound-
ed pollsters, with Iowans displaying amaz-
ing independence in voting behavior.

Roxanne Conlin, the Democratic Choice
for governor, ran well behind other

Democratic Candidates in traditionally'

Democratic areas, especially Dubuque
County, losing to Terry Branstad, other
Democrats running for state oiiice
outstripped Conlin almost Zsl,

A preelection poll released the day
before the election showed Conlin had nars
rowed the race to within two percentage
points of Branstad, with Conlin receiving
43 percent oi likely voters and Branstad
receiving 45 percent, leaving an immense
II percent undecided, which caused the
pollsters to call the race a tossup a day
before the election.

Both candidates made blunders
throughout the campaign that allowed
neither to establish a clear sense of consis
tent momentum that translates into Vics
tory. After easily winning the primary
fight, Conlin released state income tax
disclosures showing that she and her huss
band had paid no state income tax on 52.2
million in sheltered real estate in
vestments. Almost immediately, her
seven-pomt lead in the polls was
transformed into a deficit that may have
proved insurmountable.

Branstad attempted to capitalize on Con-
lin's mistake by promptly sitting on the
lead, hoping to ride out the storm up until
the election Yet he, too, made some
significant tactical errors that seemed to
erode his comfortable lead to a mere two
percent a day beiore the election.
Branstad angered many women by pro.
mising to use his inauguration to raise
funds {or antiabortlon groups Late in the
campaign he proposed that Iowa make 1-30
into a toll road to raise money to rebuild
and repair Iowa's crumbling roads and

deteriorating railways The Conlin cams
paign quickly pointed out to Branstad, who
had not researched the issue carefully,
that if such a plan were to be adopted, the
state of Iowa would lose millions of dollars
in federal highway aid.

Branstad will be sworn in as Iowa's new
governor on Jan. 10, one week aiter the
Iowa Legislature convenes business, The
youngest governor ever elected in lowa,
Branslad, as. offered the supply side ap
proach of providing tax incentives and less
regulation of business in the state during
the campaign,

Most surprising was the {act that
Branstad offered no coattails for other
Republicans running for less state of-
fices. Bob Anderson. a Democrat, beat
Larry Pope for lieutenant governor, a
powerful position that. if held by a
Republican could have been used to direct
the legislature agenda [or the new govere
nor. It is only the third time in Iowa history
that the party in control oi the governor's
office has not had a lieutenant governor of
the same party to aid in directing the
governor‘s programs through the Iowa
House The Democrats also managed to
beat entrenched incumbent Secretary of
the Treasury Maurice Baringer

The State Democratic Party, which
placed great eliort in taking both houses of
the lowa Legislature, succeeded in winnr
ing majorities in both Houses, which will
leave the new governor no choice but to
compromise with the new Democratic ma-
jority in hammering out the new direction
of the state.

In all of Iowa's congressional races the
incumbents, who all spent heavily to retain
their seats in congress, were returned by
large majorities oi the vote, The current
breakdown in the Iowa congressional
delegate is three Democrats, Tom Harkin,
Neil Smith and Berkely Bedell with three
Republicans, Jim Leach, Tom Tauke and
Cooper Evans.

Evans, thought by many as the most
vulnerable congressman in the lowa
delegation, won handily over Lynn Cutler
who came within a percentage point of
beating him in 1980. Cutler was perceived

Nation sends Reagan message,

Democrats gain seats in House

in an oii-year election where unemploy-
ment, inflation and the overall debate of
“Reaganomics” were the key issues, the
Democrats won handily.

During the campaign the Reagan Ad-
ministration figured to lose anywhere
from 17 to 25 seats in the House and still
feel comfortable As of press time the
Democrats were projected to win at least
29 seats if not a few more,

In Professor Wayne Moyer‘s opinion the
Strengthening of the Democrats will
deiinitely prove to be a legislative
challenge to current economic policies.
“The results should be enough to change

- supply-side policies," he said.

Presidental Advislor James Baker, in a
tclcVision interview, was quick to point
out, however, that the results by no means
signify a “landslide" and claimed that the
administration's top priority was to main-
tain control Of the Senate, Here the

Republicans were successful, losing only

one seat to the opposition,

Just what type or struggle will develop
between the two Houses should show up in
the debates over further budget reduc»
tions.

Many old and familiar names were in-
volved in Tuesday's election. Senator Ed
Kennedy, Senator Henry “Scoop" Jackson
and House Speaker Thomas “Tip" O'Neill
all sought and gained reelection rather
easily. Former Governor George Wallace
stepped back into the spotlight, winning a
record fourth race for Alabama's State
House One figure who made quite a name
ior himseli as governor oi Caliiornia,
Jerry Brown, was deicatcd by Republican
Pete Wilson in his bid for US Senator.

Although social issues such as gun con
trol, abortion, etc. . . were not prominent
issues, ballot propositions concerning the
nuclear irecze movement were passed in
Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island:
New Jersey and the District of Columbia

Democratic congressman in the last so

district, Evans wamped Cutler In the
outlying conservative rural areas of the
district, giving him the comiortable
margin oi victory with 55 percent of the
vote to Cutler's 45 percent.

Grinnell senior and campus coordinator
for Evans, Leeann Clayton, said she
was “surprised at the margin" of Evans'
Victory. as were most experts when the
early returns began to roll in, making it
look increasingly like it was going to be an
impressive Evans victory. Clayton added,
"I thought the race for governor went the
way it should have. Governor Ray's en-
dorsement gave Branstad some strong
support."

Jack Wordsburger, Cutler staffer at
Waterloo, said. “Lynn may have lost the
election, but she is far from defeated "

Most oi the experts were at a loss in ex-
plaining why Evans had racked up such an
impressive victory in what was touted
throughout the nation as a referendum of
Reaganomlcs. The race had been judged
as a dead heat for the last eight months.

Almost 425 students registered to vote in
this district, more than double the number
in the last presidential race in 1980, in a
doorrtoedoor voter registration drive sponr
sored by the Campus Democrats.

Not only were the Campus Democrats

they succeeded in turning out 80 percent of
the registrants, swelling the Vote total in

“Wow, that was close." said the
Democratic Central Committee Chair of
