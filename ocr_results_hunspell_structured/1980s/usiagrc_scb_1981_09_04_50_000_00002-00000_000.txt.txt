Mallroom renovation
now complete

by Melissa Kagel

"The place used to look like sin and we
havemade it intoan oasis,"commented Ex~
eculive VicerFresident Waldo Walker alter
the renovation of the Grinnell mailroom was
completed this summer

The renovation, which cost approximately
$40,000, included putting in a conveyer belt
lor incoming packages, moving the stairs to
a protected spot so they won't get icy. in-
creasing the amount or bulletin board space,
doubling the amount of workspace behind
the counter and changing the locks and are
rangement of the individual mailboxes.

“The post office is more efficient this year
because of the changes," concluded
mailroom manager Clyde French. “The ex-
tra workspace behind the counter is
especially helpful."

Some students and laculty, although they
like the appearance ol the new mailroom,
have expressed dissatisfaction about the
replacement of the old combination locks

A m o n g t h e m a n y
changes that took place at
Grinnell over the summer
was the remodeling of the
campus post office. This
meant a whole new key-

with new key locks, reported Walker.

“It was necessary to change the locks,"
stated Walker, "And it was more efficient to
have key locks put in."

Walker explained that advantages at key
locks are tighter security, which was
necessary alter the many complaints o1
mail thelt over the past few years, and the
cost at the key locks was approximately
$64,000 less than those with combinations.

Another improvement is the added
bulletin board space. The boards have been
divided into sections {or different organiza-
tions in hopa that these clubs will put one
notice on the board instead of being forced
to put one in each of the nearly 1,400
mailboxes

The only work remaining is to replace the
floor which now has many different cover-
ings. The iloor has been recemented so
many times that it will have to becompletee
ly redone,

lock system for all
mailboxes in addition to a
new floor plan that no
longer separated student
and faculty boxes. Photo
