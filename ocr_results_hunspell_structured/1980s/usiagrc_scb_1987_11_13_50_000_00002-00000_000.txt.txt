Rigoberta Menchu. a Quiche In-
dian woman irom Guatemala. is
v the international spokesperson ior
the Guatemalan Peasant Unity
‘ Committee. she has spoken at the
United Nations and before all»
diences throughout Europe. Latin
America. and the United States
about the high level oi human‘
rights abuses in her country. Meir
chu will visit Grinnell on Saturday.
November 14 to discuss the eiiects
on the peasants oi Guatemala
resulting irom the iormer military
government's campaign to
redesign the social structure oi the
country's central highlands
(where the majority indian
population is Concentratedl.
Guatemala is the iorgotten coun-
try in reporting about Central
America. it is the wealthiest Cens
tral American country and has the
highest level of direct U.S. invest-
ment in the region. President
Reagan requested a 40-iold in
crease in military assistance to
Guatemala ior ﬁscal year i936.
The Guatemalan military.
however. has consistently ranked
among the worst human-rights
violators in the world. Congress
did not appropriate any military
aid to Guatemala between i977 and
1984 because oi that country's
dismal humansrights record,
which includes 38.000 "disap
neared" since the military took

 

over the government in a CIA-
engineered coup in 1954. Another
35.000 people tmainly Indians)
have been killed in the last eight
years iequal to the total in El
Salvador) by the military or by
death squads. The central
highlands‘ isolation and language
barrier lmany oi the nation's one
half mi ion Indian citizens speak
only one of the» 22 ,indian
languagesl have made it difficult
for journalists to cover this hidden
tragedy,

Rigoberta Menchu has dedicated
her life to exposing the facts about
what is happening to the majority
indian population oi Guatemala.
Besides speaking publicly. Menchu
is the author of an acclaimed
autobiography. “I. Rigoberta Merle
chu: An In ian Woman in
Guatemala." which is available in
Buriing Library at Grinnell Col-
lege She is also recognized ior her
moving narration oi the well
received documentary on
Guatemala: “When the Mountains
Tremble.”
