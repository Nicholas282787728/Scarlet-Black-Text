The Alice in winniernnd party “A party of love, a party of peace, a party of drugs.”

By Eric Fisher

“Drink me," the beer Cried, and
as Alice slowly picked up the tiny
metal canister and placed it to her
lips, a strange tingling sensation
vibrated throughout her body
Alice's eyes closed immediately
and when she opened them. she
found herself in a strange colorful
land. A naked man in a top hat ap
proached her and Alice said. “Exc
cuse me. sir, but could you tell me
where this weird trip l'm on has
placed me'” The naked man
replied. ”Why. of course, little
girl, you‘re at Grinnell College‘s
Alice in Wonderland party."

Ofircampus party coordinator.
senior Josh Farley. said that the
Alice in Wonderland party is dif-
ierent. not only because oi its uni»
que oiferings but also because. “It
expresses the basic ideas of the
60's.” ile said that the party's
theme is “a party oi peace, party
oi love. and a party at drugs.”

Wonderland party was one oi the
tirst outdoor parties ever given "

ting helped to Ncreate an at
mosphere where people can act
without inhibitions." Josh Farley

is relaxed, “the removal of
clothes is still optional."

Joan Baez:

captivates

Civic Center

By Kris Sciiacicr

Though many sixties iolk
singers have stopped writing
rmagical song lyrics and caps
tivating melodies. loan Baez has
not. With only guitar and piano as
backup, her beautiful rich vmce
[ills concert halls with warmth
and emotion, At her September
ist concert in Des Moines. she pro
ved that her popularity remains.
Despite the fact that this was her
first concert ever in Iowa, the
Civic Center was a little more
than half full. She was greeted
warmly by the audience. and she
received two encores.

Baez does not live in the past,
but she uses her experience and
wisdom to live for the future: a
better iuture. The innocent girl
with long black hair who started
singing back in 1959 is no longer
around. She is 43 now. with short
black and silver hair, a beautiful
distinguished woman‘who is still
fighting tor her beliefs.

November 5. 1961. a young
Baez, alter singing “Last Night I
Had the Strangest Dream,” said
to her audience, “The world is
such a mess, I'd like to do
something, but l don’t know just
what.H It didn't take Baez long to
find what She could do. She shared
her music, actively protested,
Withheld taxes meant [or the
military, and was other\vis_e,in»
volved with radical politics. For
25 years she has been a iigurc of
peace. ‘ . . . -

loan iiuez in 1984;5l1e was in
Des ltioines on Sept. 1 to per-
torm oi the Civic Center,

Recently she also started a
group called “Humanitas Interna-
tional,” This campaign tries to
make the world "just a little more
decent," The group has worked on
“human rights Violations in Viet»
nam, Cambodian reiugees, the
‘desaparecidos' of Argentina, the
Nuclear Freeze. Central America.
nonrviolence education and other
projects."

Truly her life and the work that
she has done has made a dif-
ference. Her music and the model
she has provided create an incenr
tive for all of us to want to make a
diiferellce, She is not living back
in the Sixties. but she is fighting
tor the problems oi the eighties
and the decades that will follow.
With her beautiful emotional
voice. she has stirred, and will
continue to stir, the hearts ol her
lisleners, As Baez said in the Des
Moines concert. even though some
of us wish we were back in the six
ties, the problems oi the cighlies
are just as important. and we
need to get involved.

V'sions of THE
furune

By Sheila McCarthy

This weekend’s iilm
“Metropolis" introduces the
semester’s series oi iilms and lec-
tures which will address the
theme and questions so
dramatically raised in the novel
Nineteen Eighty Four.

Writing in 1943. George Orwell.
the dedicated socialist, saw in his
own warrravaged English society
economic deprivation and citizen
apathy. He ieared that these
phenomena marked the tirst
stages in the gradual erosion oi
democratic and egalitarian prin»
ciples. With equal fear. he
witnessed the rise oi poweriul
authoritarian regimes in Europe.
He concluded that all of these
wrongs must be corrected.

(irwell‘s vision of the iuture; the
world oi Oceania. or Big Brother
and the Inner Party, oi
telescreens and the Thought
Police. of the Ministry of Truth
and the Junior Spies. is a bleak
warning to his iellow citizens
about the dangers oi uncontrolled
government

Yet, as other creative artists
and commentators look to the
iuture. the visions they create
vary greatly and provoke serious
thought. it is precisely this in
formed evaluation oi difierent
possibilities for the iuture which is
the subject of the “Visions ol Ute
Future" lecture and film series
announced in the recent brochure.
