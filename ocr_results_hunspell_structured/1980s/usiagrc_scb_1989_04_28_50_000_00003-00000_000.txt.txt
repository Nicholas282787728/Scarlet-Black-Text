ARLII' AND BLAC ‘

Lenii'tgrad not so Life in a Yugoslavian monastery
far from Grinnell

by Steve Pickle

Late. It’s a disease with me.
Try as I might, I manage to be
late going places more often than
not, On my way to meet with
officials from the Herzcn P,
Institute in Lettingrad, my disease
struck again. I managed to get
lost in Peter’s city. Running
around, hoping to find the Instir
tute, l uied my few Russian sen-
tences on some passing
Leningraders. I fotlnd plenty of
people anxious to help, but none
who could really understand me
and vice versa.

Ultimately, I met a student
who spoke German and he
pointed out the way for me: back
to Nevsky Prospekt, across the
canal and over. Before long I was
in the offices of the foreign-lan-
guage faculty at the Herzen Insti-
tute‘the academic home of Dr.
Kabachki and the eight Soviet
students at Grinnell. I was late,
but not too late to meet with the
dean of the foreign—languages
faculty. I had been rescued from
my ignorance of Leningrad by the
charity of my Soviet direction»
givers. Now I would be able to
pass on greetings, some from Dr.
Kabachki and the studean, along
with a stack of Scarlet and
Blacks,

The dean greeted me warmly
and We sat down to talk. I told
him that the students and Dr.
Kabachki had said they were do-
ing well and that they wanted to
pass on their greetings. Next, I
handed him the stack of S and
Bsﬁall of the papers to date for
the current semester. I pointed
out the articles about the Heraen
students and said I hoped he
would also get a general feeling
for what Grinnell is like through
the other articles. He was very
glad to receive the papers.

Glancing at some of the arti-
cles with him, I realized just how
different Grinnell is from the
Herzen Institute. Articles about
the basketball team, minority-
studcnt recruiting, proper use of
the new logo—I wondered what
the dean would think of all of
these stories from a very different

world. Nothing like reading
about proper logo use in
Leningrad to really bring home
the importance of the issue. I
secretly hoped the dean would ask
if those were mating slugs above
the college name, but he was far
too tactful.

He did ask many questions
about the college, however. He
asked about our location: what is
central Iowa like, what is it like
to go to school there? He asked
what the college’s strong points
were considered to be, what most
of Grinnell's graduates go on to
do, and so on. l answered his
questions as best I could, and
asked many of the same questions
in return.

Most of the students at
Herzcn come frotn the Leningrad
area, Within the foreign»lan-
guage faculty, the languages pri-
marily studied are English, Ger-
man, French, anti Spanish, ale
though it is also possible to
study other languages, including
Chinese and Italian. The entire
l-lcrzcn Institute is relatively
large; the dean estimated the
number of students at about
10,000. The Institute is located
in the heart of Leningrad, just off
the main avenue, Nevsky
Prospckt. As such, it is an urban
campus without the green spaces
found at Grinnell, but with a var
riety of beautiful old buildings.
According to the dean. however,
the school is growtng too large
for its present location and the
Institute will most likely be ex'
panded to areas on the outer edges
of Leningrad in the near future.

We concluded our discussion
after about half an hour. I
thanked the dean for his time. and
us I left I thought about how for-
tunate I was to have been able to
meet with him. That I was able
to do so, via contacts in Grinnell,
is a testament to how small the
world really is. From pedestrians
eager to help me find my way, to
a talk about Grinnell with a So-
viet educator, the theoretically
very different city of Leningrad
was not so far from home,

Built in the ISth century, the
active Monastery of Decliani re
mains a bastion of solitude,
peace, and of Christian Orthodox
worship in the Moslem-domi-
nated and politically chaotic re
gion of Kosovo, Yugoslavia.
The monastery, surrounded on
three sides by pinercovered hills
and fresh mineral springs, still
serves the sparse Orthodox
community in Dcehani by
performing baptisms, wedding
ceremonies, and funeral services,
as well as functioning as a
meeting point for the Christian
community. However, monastic
life is not as sitnplc or relaxed as
one may think; looking after the
animals, harvesting in tire fall,
maintaining the 450-year—old
monastery, and endless
entertaining are but a few of the
additional tasks the monks must
perform.

The monastery, two kilome-
tcrs out of town, sits peacefully
and Seemingly oblivious to the
current political struggles; over
the last 450 years, the monks
have seen many different govr
ernments come and go and have
learned not to interfere too heavr
ily in political affairs. Despite
their non-interference policy, the
current political strife and the
change to “alheistic” socialism
under Tito has affected Duhani as
well as other monasteries in Yu-
goslavia. Only five monks cur-
rently live in the monastery
(down from 15 as recently as
1975), and many of the more
conservative Moslems and
socialists often make them feel
unwelcome in Dcchani. Other
monasteries throughout Yu»
goslavia are having srmiliar
difficulties. Many have problems
attracting new members and often
feel negative pressure from their
surrounding communities.

Despite these problems,
monastic life today carries on in
much the same way it did in the
15th century. During my eight-
day stay in Deshani, t packed
away my Grinnell College garb,
donned what I would describe an
15th century Levi‘s, and partici-
pated as much as possible in the
daily activities of the monastery.

An average day began at 5:30
am. (and anyone that knows me
knows that for sure this was the
most difficult task of all;), with
ringing of the church bell in the
tower at 6 a.m., and prayers in
Ancient Greek till 7 am. For
breakfast, I would usually make
potatoes and onions somehow,

Graduate

bread, and other vegetables (the
monks are Strict vegetarians.)
After I cleaned the kitchen, I
would go and collect fresh min-
cral water from the springs he-
hind the ntonastery walls. Other
chores which I sometimes at»
tended to included feeding the any
imals (two dogs, one cow, and
some chickens), collecting wood
for the old stoves (no central
heatingl), cleaning the living
quarters, walking into town to
buy fresh bread. and preparing
endless cups of Turkish coffee for
the endless number of guests and
visitors.

After lunch (usually potatoes
and onions somehow), we all had
a little free time. Oftentitnes
three of the monksiVarnuvus,
Justini, and Alexi, all with long
grey beards and bushy eyebrows.
dressed in black robcsiwould sit
with me and discuss the Bible.
Thanks to Mr. Haas’ Christian
Scriptures class, I was able to
discuss With them rather intricate
SUbjCCIS such as Paul‘s letters,
Revelations, and the differences
between the four Gospels. Orig-
inally, I felt nervous about re-
vealing my religion; however,
when I told them I was Jewish,
pleasant smiles of surprise spread
across their faces, and our
conversation turned to the He-
brew Bible and its ramifications
on Christianity.

We prayed for another hour at
5 p.m., had dinner, and by 8 pm.
went off to our cells to study.
Varnavus and I became quite

close friends and I would often
sneak into his cell, curl up in
front of the woodburning stove,
and road or discuss with him reliv
gion, politics, ethics, or history.

I thought it strange at the
time that these ntonks, living
such an antiquated lifestyle, with
no electricity, no TV. no car. no
newspaper delivered to their door,
could be so knowledgeable about
the world, about foreign lane
guages, history, polities—about
life. Tlteir lives were so simple,
tightly bound with nature and
peopleifceding the animals,
collecting water, cutting wood.
praying, listening to others; the
monks themselves reflected their
natural, uncomplicated lifestylei
they all were so wise, so healthy,
so positive. “Who are we, "
Vamavus reminded me, “to say
that this or that is good or bad’li
we have not that power nor that
knowledge," (This comment
came after he asked me what I
thought of President Bush!)

I went to Dechani to satisfy
tny curiosity about monastic
culture in Yugoslavia. After
eight days. I left with more
questions thtm I had when I came,
My experience in the monastery
made me rercvaluate my life in
many ways. And, while I don‘t
think I will be a Serbian
Orthodox monk, if any seniors at
Grinnell still don’t know what to
do after graduation. here's one
more option you probably
overlooked!
