' EDITORIAL calls {or the
revitalization of the campus pub:
“Reinstating the privilege of a
campus pub is the most responsir
hie path at action that the Dean of
Students can follow in reducing the
student body's exposure to risk.”

The editor argues that the new
alcohol policy written to protect
the school’s liability is driving
students of! Campus to drink. “If
one approaches the situation
pragmatically, one knows students
are going to drink, Forcing the
students into the Memphis bars
will increase student risk
dramatically in that it heightens
the chance of drinking and driving.
Also, these bars are in crime
ridden areasl Students here have
been held up at gunpoint several
times at these bars."

Under the new policy, the school
can legally serve beer to 35 percent
oi the student body, but the editor
contends that the entire student
body should have the option of
staying on campus.

running against current national
trends. Also, an SGA budget will be
put on the computer, and Liz is en-
couraging the 25 percent of
students who don't drink beer to
drop in on the Health Center Bar.

Dave is strongly encouraging
people to pick up their Book Sale

internships

by Cindy Jones

At the September 9 iaculty
meeting, Waldo Walker. acting
president oi Grinnell College,
announced that a new, competitive
scholarship was put into eltect as
oi this year. The Howard R. Bowen
Scholarship Program is named in
honor oi a iormer member oi the
Grinnell faculty. The program is
similar to the Baker Scholarship,
discontinued in 1962, which at»
tracted President Drake to Grin
nell College. The Bowen scholarr
ship will be open to lowa high—
school seniors and will oiier $5,500
a year in iinancial aid, Nehty
semi-iinalists will be required to
take an exam and to be intervlews
ed on campus. or these 20 semi~
iinalists, five will be chosen by a
faculty board to receive this
scholarship.

Currently, the scholarship is
open to iowa students, but depen~
ding upon the number oi ap-
plicants, the Bowen scholarship
could, in the future, apply to other
students as well. The college exr

pects a possible 200 applicants [or
the scholarship this year.

Approval oi a pass/tail grading
option for internships also ap~
peared on the agenda. The option,
which passed, was the only one oi
nine recommendations submitted
by the Internship Evaluation Com»
mittee that required iormal action.
The committee ielt that the option
provided a good solution to the
grading versus no-grading system
or internship evaluation, where
neither system was appropriate
alone.

Jo Calhoun, a member of the
committee, noted, “The reason the
pass/fail option was included in the
evaluaton report wa that it ol-
iered ﬂexibility to indi 'dual iacul-
ty members, some of whom felt
very strongly about it.”

The option requires a procedure
difierent from the one required for
regular courses; the pass/iail op-
tion {or internships would have to
be discussed with iacult members
bctorehand instead oi having the

supervisor not find out until he or
she receives the grading slip. This
option does not include such pro-
grams as the Washington
Technology Semester. Also, the
pass/{ail option cannot be used {or
internships that would apply
toward a major. Arguments
against the option included the
idea that it would be used as a
loophole to work around the pre-
sent smndards or deiinitions, and
that it would be used ior inap
propriate reasons. Those in iavor
oi die pass/[ail option believed that
the option would aid in difﬁcult
evaluations, appeal to the
students, and Should b Included
for the same reason as i s includ~
ed in other academic areas. It was
noted that the pass/{ail justiﬁca-
tion would be reviewed in the con-
tract evaluation, and ii a super»
visor felt that the internship did not
warrant the 300718Vel course
rating, it should be brought to the
evaluation committee’s attention.

The state, of Grinnell’s
currlculum

by w.s, Walker

Each year in July I prepare an
EndaOl‘r'I‘hanear Report ior the
President, The approach which i
usually employ is that of express
ing my observations and opinions
concerning three areas oi the Col-
lege's operations. First, I address
the areas ior which i am directly
and personally responsible such as
the budget process, supervision oi
administrative personnel. cons
struction and renovations, etc. Se-
cond, 1 cover areas which iall
within my supervisory purview
such as admission financial aid

elsewhere in this country.

I believe that the College is in ex»
cellent general condition and ap
pears to be strong enough in most
areas to hold this quality well into
the iuture. i believe that the iacul-
ty is generally very strong in terms
oi the quality oi its training, its
teaching periormance and its
scholarly activities. i believe that
the uniiormity oi the strength oi
the disciplinary programs oi the
academic departments is the
greatest that l have observed in
the past 30 yea i believe that,

“I believe that the facultyfi interest :11 the
genaul education program has reached

the lowest letdthatllmeobsemed in the
thirty years that I have been here.”

 

computer services, physical plant,“

etc. Third, I include a section
related to the general state of the
College and which entrcau major
elements or the College's pro
grams such as the curriculum,
physical iacilities, quality oi
students, etc.

In the report {or 1987, I included
my View of the current state of the
College’s curriculum. i came to
Grinnell in 1958 immediately after
a new curriculum had been voted
into existence by the faculty, It
consisted of both required core
courses, distribution re-
quirements, and a signiiicant
language requirement. After
teaching ior several years within
that curriculum, i was appointed
to the post of academic dean, This
occurred shortly alter the imr
plementation oi the College's
“Open Curriculum” as it currently
exists. Since that time I have
observed at very close range two
major eiiorts to modin the “Open
Curriculum,” Given the fact that,
ior one brief moment I again have
a stump irom which to address
matters academic, I wish to pre
sent to the faculty some of my
observations and opinions concern
mg the College's curriculum which
1 included in my report to the
Prcsident. i have also added a lew
comments rorlceriiiilg" current
trends ‘ ‘ 'a

with the completion oi the renova
tion oi Ann and Goodnow, the
quality oi the College’s physical
iacilities is at the highest level that
it has ever been, Grinnell's
teaching equipment is oi excellent
quality. i believe that Grinnell tru-
ly deserves to be included among
the top 10 or twelve oumtanding
small, private, liberal arts colleges
in the country.

Having expressed all oi these
positive beliefs, I must admit that I
have serious concern about two
areas related to Grinnell’s
academic enterprise.

First, the main theme til such
exists) or Grinnell’s “No Rea

institution oi core and/or distribu-
tion requirements. Twice during
the 16 years, Grinnel] has made
very serious eiiorts to change its
curriculum in that general direc-
tion. Both eiiorts failed to Win the
support necessary ior implementa
tion. i suspect that there may have
been many reasons behind the
iailures oi the proposed curricular
revisions such as statiing con»
siderations, concern over the
possible negative eiiect oi change
on our admission applicant pool,
concern over possible loss o op-
portunity to teach upper div ion
“favorite courses”, etc. in my opir
nion, most or these reasons were
not very valid. Prior to 1911, Grin-
nell's curriculum contained over 70
sections oi required core courses
plus a signiiicant number oi
courses designed to satisiy
distribution requirements, The
faculty size in terms ol full-time
equivalents was slightly smaller
than it currently is. Certainly, the
signiiicantly increased size of the
admission applicant pool has
reduced the threat that any change
in the curriculum might pose to the
College's enrollment. i submit
that, as time passes and the Col-
lege continues to pursue its current
habit oi avoidance oi curricular
change, the reasons behind the
lack oi action become less and less
valid.

I believe that although its {acuity
and academic descipiinary pro
grams are very strong. the Cola
lege’s failure to meet the need ior
