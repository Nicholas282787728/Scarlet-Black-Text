Golden and Kosmidis

plan for the future

8 y Ellen Brooke

On Wednesday. April 4, the 5&8
conducted interviews with recent
1y elected SGA president, Matt
Golden. and Vice president, Mary
Kosmidis. The following is a com-
pilation of the two interviews.

sch: What are your opinions
concerning current campus and
SGA issues, such as ﬁle role SGA
should play dealing with political
issues?

Golden: SGA Should be a
political body, especially on issues
that directly concern us. it people
wanted SGA to be apolitical. then

 

Matt Golden

they were right not to vote for me.
I have no interest in being presi-
dent oi a body that is apolitical.

Kosmidis: I think that SGA
should definitely take political
stands. If students are interested
enough in a specific issue, SGA is
the means for them to go about ex-
presssing their opinions. SGA is
the only elected body we have.
There are committees, like SASG.
but for issues that come up during
the year there isn’t enough time to
create committees. If there aren’t
enough people that agree with a
certain issue then i don’t think
SGA should state an opinion.

5&3: As hall president now. do
many people come to you to
discuss issues".

Kosmidis: No, I have to ask
them. i tried putting up a blank
sheet oi paper on the board next to
my report. Not even anything fun-
ny was written on it. i-lall
presidents have to go out and ask.
Many times people don’t have 0in
nions on certain issues. For the
ones that do, though. SGA should
be there for them,

5&3: What would be an effec
tive way to maybe not get
students more involved. but to at
least let them know the channels
to go through?

Golden: Hopefully we could
have booklets accessible to the
students. Over this summer I’m
going to take a look at a book
Mark Bradshaw put together last
year. I’d like to be able to
distribute this, with minor im-
provements. perhaps having one
near all the hall telephones, this
would not be excessively costly. it
will have to come up before JB
(Joint Board) to pass.

Also I would like to publish at
least part of the JB agenda in die
campus memo. I would like the
hall presidents to make this idea
cessihle to their dorms as well.

5&5: What about SGA’s role
concerning South African divatr
merit?

'Golden: I’think Grinnell has to
oppose actively apartheid. As far

as I can see right now, I think
divestment would be the best way
to oppose apartheid. Next year I’d
like to get some speakers irom
South Africa — if possible from
the South African embassy. That
way we could hear what they
thought. Obviously we should also
have someone representing an an
tithetical View. Perhaps he
wouldn’t want to participate in a
debate, that might be rather dif-
ficult for him. We could question
these people in terms of what op
tions are open to us.

StitB: Will it be possible for us to
get these speakers?

Golden: We could get sponsor-
ship not only through student com-
mittees, but also through Rosenr
field grants. and others. In terms
of student committees. I’d like to
see PASF‘ take a more affirmative
role. It’s necessary that PASF
allot funds to groups who come to
them requesting money. but I also
think there are times when issues
will press them to say that they’re
going to help bring it about. i feel
that divestment is an issue that
the whole campus should know
about,

Kosmidis: I’m definitely for
South African divestment. When I
was a ireshman, there was a lot
more student awareness. There
were some demonstrations, I
don't mink this year’s freshmen
and sophomores know much about
this issue.

I think SGA should be concerned
about its credibility with the ad
ministration, but when it supporw
an issue. it should be assertive. If
we want someuiing, we have to
make that point clear to them.

8&3: Would you like to see SGA
run the student shuttle service
again?

Golden: Yes. I'd like to see us
get the ‘shuttles back. We lost
money without them. When SGA
ran it, it was a closed system.
Students put money in. buying
their tickets, and they were get-
ting something back from the pro
fits made. Allegedly. we received
money to compensate for this,
which is, in part. true. There were
a number of reasons Why the ad-
ministration gave us this money. I
think the service now is inconve-
nient. We have to go into town to
purchase our tickets, they're
more expensive, and we don’t get
anything back.

3518: Would you be able to come
up with a system which would pre-
vent what happened second
semester last year. when they
cancelled the only shuttle to
Chicago?

Golden: As it stands now, the
company running it will cancel a
bus to any place it they don’t get
enough people either. whereas we
can send a van to send smaller
groups oi people to places like Des
Moines, they won't even do that.
So that problem has not been
alleviated.

5&8: What are your opinions
concerning the security force?

Golden: We have to have a
security iorce in order to use Dare
by, Gardner, and other places for
allcampus parties. The main pro-
blem with the present system is
that it is a giant waste oi money. I
worked on security once, and
guarded an elevator. I wasn't im»
pressed that mat was a wise
allocation of money. i think it
would be best to go back to the

system used when I was a
freshman. Each dorm took care of
their own security force, and they
weren‘t paid. but they were given
a t~shirt each.

S&B: Wasn't there a need to
revise that system?

Golden: That was the ad-
ministration's contention, and
they might be right. From time to
time it caused problems.

Kosmidis: It’s necessary to
have some type of security for all-
campus parties. Hall councils
have enough to deal With in
organizing the parties, so l don't
see why they should have any
more of a burden. I realize that
the present force Costs us a lot.
That is the main contention, plus
the people who are working for it
either don‘t take it seriously.
drink on the job, or just leave
earlier and sign for more hours
than they've worked.

Hall councils should try to make
sure that these people are there as
long as they said they were, Judg-
in g from the way people are work-
ing for money, I don’t know if we
could count on people for
volunteers.

5&3: What steps are you going
to take in dealing with the
bookstore issue?

Golden: I'd like to approach this
through the libraryrbookstore
committee. That would be the
channel to investigate this, There
are coop bookstores at other
schools. People on aid don’t get a
break on their books. People
should pay according to their
ability, or the books should be
made cheaper to everyone, Either
of these I would consider a major
improvement. We would have a
much better system.

SStB: What do you think SGA'S
effectiveness is now, and what
areas can be improved?

Golden: As far as social things
go, SGA does a great job. The idea
that we run those things, general
allocation of funds for social
events, as a coop is great,

In political areas, we've made
improvements since we were
freshmen. We’re more organized
now than we were then. The issues
that come before the body are
generally more responsible 0in
nions. Calling for Dean Fraser to
'resign was probably not a very
wise move for SGA. I think we’ve
moved away irom that. Progress
can be continued in terms of
presenting our bills in a more

organized manner. It’d also be.

Number 21

J.B. votes down
controversml

proposal

by Elliot Spagat

The ninety minute meeting of
SGA’s Joint Board held this past
Wednesday night centered on
discussion of the recent controverr
sy involving the selection oi in-
structor of Afro»American
Literature.

Debate on the issue ended when
Mark Wolfgang Schumann's pro
posed resolution was voted down
by a solid majority.

Schumann's proposed resolu~
tion stated that ”the best
available candidate may be of any
race” and that it is notin the “bat
interest” of a college that prac»
tices a non-discrimination policy

to make race a deciding factor. _

The proposed resolution drew
reaction from an unusally large
number of those who attended.
Many students felt that special
consideration to race was justified
in this particular case. When Todd
Coulter cited that the number of
professorships held by blacks has
declined from five to one since
1975 while the number of black
students has decreased from 75 to
43, students Voiced concern about
the Grinnell community becoming
increasingly homogenized.

, Coulter, who acknowledged that
he was’emotional ahoi‘it'the issue,
suggested that a black professor
might serve as a “role model” for
black students, including himself.

Other students recognized such
an asset. Rob Sckalor pointed out
that the advantages of hiring a
black instructor outweigh any
small difference in quality since
all candidates which are Seriously

considered are presumably wen-
qualified.

Still others felt the college was
setting a dangerous precedent by
considering race to be a deciding
factor. They viewed it to be in line
with a policy of reverse
discrimination.

In addition, Main Hall President
Dave Mathias argued that “being
black doesn‘t mean . . . one has the
experience oi being black,”

Finally, the proposal was put to
a vote and defeated.

A discussion about high prices
at the college bookstore revolved
around the issue of how students
can help to solve the problem. A
suggestion was put forth to
pressure profasors into making
early orders and thus bring about
lower prices. Another suggestion
called for less frequently used
books to be placed on permanent
reserve for student use at Burling
Library, An SGA committee is
currently negotiating with the ad-
ministration on this matter.

Student Coordinator Randy
Cochrell expressed concern over
the high cost of the April 14 Spring
Waltz. He suggested a possible
FOG Fest in which students would
voluntarily miss a meal so that
the‘tor'egone expense could be
donated to SGA's dwindling funds.
In the past. FOG FesE have been
designed solely for charity
benefits

Students were encouraged to
participate in next week's blood
drive and were reminded that the
faculty will vote on the Parslow
Proposal this April to,

Sports symposium
attracts

national spotlight

by Jeff Raymond

Once again, tiny Grinnell Col-
lege is grabbing a share or the na-
tional spotlight with this week's
symposium on “Sports and the
National Character" as media
representatives from as iar as
New York descend upon this came
pus to cover the event.

Director of College Relations
William Deminoff listed one dozen
organizations who had applied for
press credentials for the symr
posium. He said more press per-
sons might show up wrdiout prior
clearance and would be granted
access to the event.

Among the iamiliar names who
had confirmed their plans to at
tend with College Relations by
Wednesday morning were the
New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New Yorker Magazine.
the Des Moines Register (which is
sending three representatives)
and the Kansas City Star.

other organizations who said
they would attend were TV chan
nels B and 13 from Des Moines.
Iowa Public Television. KCRG-TV
from Cedar Rapids, WHBF-TV
from Rock Island, 111., .WSUI radio
and two reporters from the Cedar

Rapids Gazette.

The planned television coverage
necessitated the use of Darby
Gymnasium to hold the sym»
posium. Deminoii said that Her-
rick Chapel would have been a
logical location for the convocar
tion and the panel discussions but
Darby is better suited to accom»
modate television cameras.

He also said that once the symr
posium got underway with Thurs
day’s Convocation by sir Roger
Bannister. it made sense to keep
the other items on the agenda
there too. He said that the Bans
nister Convocation could draw as
large an audience as the speeches
by Soviet visitor Georgi Arbatov
last year did.

Deminoff said that the school is
doing a lot of follow-up work aiter
the symposium to make sure that
transcripts and other iniormation
is disseminated to all interested
parties.

“It’s part or the ongoing pro-
gram in projecting what the col~
lege's programs are and projec
ting the level and quality of the
programs we have." said
Deminof :tit should do usa lot oi
