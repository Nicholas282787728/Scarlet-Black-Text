The facts on Affirmative Action

The following article was written and submitted by the members of the
Affirmative Action Advisory Committee (AAAC). While it is not normal
policy of the Scarlet and Black to print such articlm anywhere but on the
Op-Ed pages. we felt that the AAAC should be allowed space so that they
may accurately inform the campus community of the College’s hiring

policy. -'l‘he Editors.

i. History of The Affirmative
Action (AA) Program.

Each year the Affirmative Ac»
tion Advisory Committee tAAACl
discusses how to best inform the
college community about the al-
firmative action program.

Although faculty and staff
receive Copies of the guidelines.
copies are not distributed to the
student body. We believe dial
commitment to an affirmative ac-
tion program requires that all in
dividuals be well informed about
the specifics of the guidelines

This article, while stimulated
by recent events, is not intended
as a response to those events, but
rather as an attempt to provide
some general information about
the guidelines and motivate those
who have not read the guidelines
in their entirety to do so. Our cams
ments are primarily directed
toward publicrzing the program
as it relates to faculty recruitment
and retention, noting that the ra-
tionale for professional staff and
support stall are identical, but
hiring procedures differ.

The AAAC was created to ad,
vise the, President, laculty. pro»
fessional staff. support stall and
the student body on the implemen-
tation of the college's affirmative
action program, The committee is
composed of representatatives for
the faculty. student body, profeSr
sional stall and support services
and the Affirmative Action of-
ficer (AAO) who serves ex officio.

Grinnell College's affirmative
action guidelines were approved
by the faculty and the Board of
Trustees in 1977. They were revise
ed in 19824” by the AAAC. and
copies were distributed to the
faculty. protessional stall and the
support staff committee on Oc-
tober 3. 1933.

The introduction to the
guidelines identifies the federal
legislation on which the guidelines
are based and also affirms the
College‘s commitment to
“employ. compensate and pro
mote persons on the basis of merit
and litness." The guidelines state
the need for an educational in-
stitution such as Grinnell College
to provide for its students a
significant number ol women and
minorities on its faculty and in
positions of authority in its ad-
ministration while recognizing
that lt “will require dedicated efr
fort by all those responsible for
personnel decisions along with
provisions of needed financial
resources" to realize these goals.

The intent of the Affirmation
Action Program is best sumr
marizcd in the final paragraph of
the introduction:

Wcorccommillcd locrlro mom in
searclung for women and lninonly
candidates so that more often than in
the post, we will lino among such pun
sons the individual most likely to best
mcel lhe needs u/ the college.

As the accompanying table
“Composi 'on of the Grinnell
Faculty” indicates. the number of
women doubled from 1977 to 1978.
but both the number and percen»
tage has decreased in the past two
years. The number of blacks has
decreased from 6 in 1976~77 to one
in 1983-84.

Grinnell College is one Of the
few colleges in the Associated Col-
leges of the Midwest which has no

women or minorities who hold the ,

rank of full professor.

III. College‘s Goals.

The guidelines state that our
minimum goal is to increase the
number of minorities and women
of the faculty to at least the
percentage of such persons na—
tionally with PhD. ’5 or equivalent
final degrees. Presently this
number is 21% women and 3%
minorities.

However. as the guidelines go
on to state, these goals. especially
for minorities. are indeed
minimum aspirations. “The Col-

AAAC discusses faculty hiring

by Eric Green

In recent years the percentage
of minority and female represenr
tation on the Grinnell faculty has
declined con5lderably. There is
gcneral agreement that these
numbers should change (the Affir-
matlvc Action Advisory Commit
tee tAAACl cites 25 percent
female and five percent minority
representation on the faculty as
its goal). but change raises issues
of departmental autonomy, adr
ministrative activism and — in
rare Instances — reverse
discrimination.

The AAAC was established
primarily to advise the Affir-
mative Action Officer and to react
to events arising in the college
community concerning Allin
mative Action. Bearing this nar
row mandate in mind. Committee
Chairwoman Roberta Atwell.
associate professor ol Education,
said the group has discussed aCr
tivism on their part only on a
peripheral basis.

Atwell stressed that. in the
Grinnell context. Affirmative Acs
tion does not mean hiring in
dividuals less qualified than
others. but rather enlarging the
pool of applicants for any given
position to include more qualified
women and minorities,

Regarding the small number of
minorities on Grinnell's faculty.
Atwell noted four reasons that she
thought partly responsible:

1. It is often difficult to identify
minorities when examining. can-
didates' dossiers.

expand extra resources to develop
lull information on promising
minority and women candidates.

ON-CAMPUS INTERVIEWS ~
The Department Shall send to the
Dean of the Faculty and to the
AAO the dossiers of the can-
didates whom it wishes to invite
for an tin-campus interview. The
Dean of the Faculty, in consulta-
tion with the AAO. shall have the
final approval of candidates for
oncampus interviews,

2, Once promising candidates
are identified. a concerted effort
is not always made to hire them.

a. stronger commitments
(monetary or otherwise) could be
made to retain minorities once
they are hired.

4. Candidates often shy away
from Grinnell because it lacks a
black community.

To meet the committee's goals
of increasing the number of
women and minority faculty
members. Atwell said the Affir-
mative Action guidelines should
be applied “more consistently on
all levels and in all departments.”

nory Slater, a student represen-

tative on the AAAC. believes the
Affirmative Action program
would be more effective if the ad»
ministration pushed it strenuous-
] .
ylrle noted. however. that such
activism by the administration
could engender conflict with the
department involved in the selec
tion of a laculty member. “it’s
really touchy when cascs come to
departments Vs. administration."
he said.

Another problem in hiring
minorities. according to Slater. is
the atmosphere of “intellectual
snobbery. where people attribute
the quality of a candidate to the
name of the school they
attended." This process
eliminates many women and
minorities who did not.attend
prestigious institutions, he said.

'A danger in not raising the
number of minority faculty at

reopen the search at any point if
the existing field of candidates is
inadequate for any reason in
cluding the lack of sufficient pro-
mising minority and women can-
didates.

The Department shall turn over
all candidates dossiers to the
AAo at the conclusion of the
search.Thecollegeshallretainall
such documents for four years.

Grinnell is that the minority stUr
dent population will also decline.

Director of Admissions John
Hopkins said that. following a
decline in the midr'7Ds. the minorir
ty student population has been
steady in recent years. However.
he said that the minority-faculty
issue is raised in the recruitment
process.

The Office of Admissions cur
rently employs two full-time
recruiters for minority students.
This, said Hopkins. “underscores
Grinnell's commitment and also
the difficulties in minority recruit
ment." He pointed out that a
number of changes. most notably
declining city budgets and the
growth of city universities and
community colleges. has caused
declining minority enrollment in
colleges nationwide.

All concerned parties agree that
the goals of the AAAC are ap
propriatc and that the present
statistics point out a need for
greater diversity on the faculty,
As the events of this semester
have shown. thorny issues abound
when dealing with Affirmative
Action.

Hopefully it has been a learning
process. a realization that. in me
words of the Affirmative Action
guidelines, “An increase in the
number of women and minorities
at Grinnell will not be achieved
just by wishing it but will require
dedicated effort by all those
responsible for personnel deci-

- sions along with provision at need~

ed financial resources.”

lege should aspire to do better.
that is, to be a model not of the
world as it is. but of the world with
less race discrimination and less
sex discrimination. then in con
temporary American society. A
more challenging goal for the next
five years are 25% female and 5%
minority group members of the
faculty."

As the AA guidelines further
State:
