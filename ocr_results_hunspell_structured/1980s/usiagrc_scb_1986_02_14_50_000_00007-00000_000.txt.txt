If .

“If . . released in 1969, is a portrait oi
lite in a repressive English boarding
school where three students revolt during
their senior year. Based on the screenplay
by David sherwm and John Howlett entitl-
ed “Crusaders," director Lindsay Ander-
son uses the British public school system
as a microcosm oi society to demonstrate
the repression oi the individual by authorir
ty. According to Pauline Kael, “ ‘If , . .'
appears to be a clinical expose oi the horri-
ble organized bedlam inilicted on English
boys in the name oi gentleman's educa
tion, The iilm is especially iixated on the
cruelties that the students perpetrate
against each other . . the battlecry is ior
ireedom and nonconiormity and an end to
stupidity, rigidity, hypocrisy and cruelty.
The violence is thus given a psychological
meaning and justification; it is to explode
the repressive system, to liberate men
irom all the dull nastiness that the corrupt
school represents.”

The Times of
Harvey Milk

”The Times oi Harvey Milk“ will be
shown again this week on Sunday, Feb. 16,
at 9 pm, in south Lounge,

Aguirre,
The Wrath of God

in the mid 1500‘s, a large Spanish expedi-
tion searching tor the mythical last city oi
El Dorado detached on advanced party to
explore a tributary oi the Amazon; they
never returned. Werner Herzog has ex-
trapolated this obscure historical incident

into “Aguirre, The Wrath of God." a spec- .

tacularly horriiying chronicle oi im-
perialism gone amok. In Herzog's version,
the conquistadors' expedition falls into the
hands of one Don Lope de Aguirre, a
. powerrdriven lunatic who dreams of steals
ing an entire continent. Aguirre, originally
named second-incommand, usurps con-
trol in pursuit of territory to rule his own.
At the same time, die very instruments
and characters sustaining the journey are
gradually eliminated. Food, rafts, supr
plies, and crew members are last; the
landscape changes until there is no land,
properly speaking, to conquer, only river
and swamps. In the face of desolation,
Aguierre maintains obsessive faith in
reality of his dreams, weaving tales of his
future glory. Klaus Kinski (father of
Natassia Kinski) delivers a magnificent
periormance as Aguirre, creating a iunny
— scary quintessence or menacing
malevolence, part Richard 111, part Attila,
the Hun. Stunningly photographed in
hazardous locations in the jungles of Peru
along the Amazon, “Aguirre, The Wrath of
God" takes the viewer on a mad voyage as
lrightening and entertaining as one iii
Edgar Allan Poe's epics of elementcd
discovery,

Produced and directed by the well-
known Werner Herzog, ”Aguirre, The
Wrath of God” is a perfect compliment to
“Deliverance." Part of the Foreign Film
festival German with English subtitles To
be shown on Thursday, February 20 in
South Lounge at 9:30 pm. — D.L.

Folk Dancers
to Perform
this Weekend

by Jonathan Greisillg

The Grinncll Folk Dancers will mark
their twenty-iirst year as part or the Grins
nell community with shows on Friday and
Saturday nights at 7:00 pm. in Roberts
Theater

“The dancers started in 1965 as part or
the PEG,” said Julia Schult, class of ’85.
”And later went on to be a club under
Pirko Rocker of the college staff ”

Schult now lives in Grinnell and is an ac-
tive folk dancer.

Besides pertorming on campus, the
dancers periorm ior high schools, the town
or Grinnell’s Arts in the Park program, St.
Francis' Manor, and {or senior citizens‘
groups.

“We do Russian, Hungarian, Turkish,
Bulgarian, and Rumanian dances," Schult
said. “We have also done Chinese,
English, Scottish, Irish, Armenian, and
Ukrainian styles."

A number of international students have
participated in the group. Schult said these
come both to learn and to teach.

“They come here and don't necessarily
know their country's dances. But even if
they don‘t know a dance, they have pro
bably seen it done and can help us with
style,” she said.

At one time. the group boasted over 100
members from the campus and the com-
munity. “It‘s supposed to be a town and
gown group,” Schult explained, “but
there's not much gown now,”

Though the structure oi the group allows
ior a wide range or participation, time cons
stralnts have shrunken the folk dancers'
membership in recent years.

“It's a cumulative effect. People see
iewer people out practicing and having
iun and so they're less likely to join,"
Schult said.

“Also, some anti-folk dance sentiment
has appeared on campus, It‘s supposed to
be wimpy or something,” Schult coma
mented. “People don’t realize what kind of
physical prowess it takes,”

Schult said that several special
workshops will be held later this semester.
On February 22. for example, they will
hold a ballroom dance workshop along
with a proiessional dance couple hired
from out of town.

Practices are held Sundays at 1:00 pm.
and Fridays at 7:00 pm. All are welcome
to attend.

The New KDIC

by l\'0ri Wood

' KDIC has made several changes this
semester in programming and organiza-
tion. There are 20 new program slots this
semester making a total oi 70 shows, Andy
Huestis, station manager, and the other
new staff members will have 3 cans
Slderable amount of work this semester
because of the new schedule. Huestis ex-
plains that KDIC has changed from 50
shows to 70 shows in order to accomodate
more students who wish to have a radio
show. The shorter shows are more appeal-
ing to students but also create more work
for the staff members, “There are 30 to 40
beginners this semester who require more
supervision and training," explains
Huestis.

Another major change is the news pm
gram at KDIC. News director Ali El Saffar
has instigated a system in which reading
news on the air is optional for DJ‘s. “They
used to have to read the news 2 or 3 times
during a show," explalns Huestis. Now
there |s a one-hour news report at 11:00
a n1. and a ten to fifteen-minute show at
7:00 pm. Monday through Friday.

KDIC has installed a computerized data
base for their record library. The new
system would allow DJ’s to find requested
songs or albums more efficiently. The DJ
would simply have to type in the name of a
song to find the artist, the album, or any
other relevant information, Having a well-
organized record library may also help
reduce the number at thefts each
Semester.

The KDIC staff also plans to improve
contacts nationally and internationally in
order to serve as a test center for musical
groups and manufacturers. Through bet
ter publicity, organization, and a- larger
listening audience KDIC will be able to
achieve these goals.
