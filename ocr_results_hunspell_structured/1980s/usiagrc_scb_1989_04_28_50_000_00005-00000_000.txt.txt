lets insults fly

by Morton Downey Jr.

Although unsuccessful at last
fall's Olympics in Seoul, a [0177
notch team from Grinnell has
shown that it has the stuff of a
gold—medal team. Members
compete in nothing so glamorous
as the marathon er lOO-meter
dash. In fact, it is really only an
exhibition sport, but one in
which all members of the team
were prepared.

Ira Strauber led the Grinnell
invective-hurl team to a sweep of
all events. The team consisted of
Grinnell pseudo—professor of eco-
nomics Cliff Reid, economics
professor Paul Munyon, politi»
calrscience professor Ira Strauber,
history professor Toln Hietala,
English professor Betsy Debbs,
and chemistry professor Gene
Wubbels. President George
Drake was a member of the team
ex officio.

The tealn started off on a bad
foot when Hieteta was penalized
for unnecessary whining. He had
complained that “everybody exr
peets too much work from us. I
just don’t see how I can fit three
practices in for every event."

SLrauber drew boos from the
crowd with “Oh yeah? So's your
mother." However, in the veiled-
insult category, Strauber was the
clear winner with “Not bad 77 for
a sophomore." Dobbs won the
inleidating foreshadowtng award
with “Pray, my dear, pray that
you do well on the final."

Honorary student member
Mike Kent drew a standing ova-
tion with “You complacent, self-
rightous liberal pinkos think
you‘re better than the rest of us.
There's no place in this world for
your brand of anti-elitist elitism."

George Drake almost
disqualified the entire team when
he exclaimed, “Come on, every
body. Gee, we don't really have
to be so nasty. Let‘s just all sit
down and discuss our differences,
Let’s look for something that we
can agree on." He then proceeded
to suggest that a logo might
unify everyone and left immedi—
ately to seek $40,000. However,
when he returned, Diake redeemed
himself by yelling at the team
from Carleton, “Ha! Who cares
who cares what someone from a

shows his winning form.

number-12 school thinks
anyway?”

History professor Don Smith
entered late with “The judges of
this event have an impoverished
sense of what constitutes a qualr
ity insult. I see no alternative
than to use a somewhat underr
handed method to circumvent the
entire process." Several seconds
later a bomb threat caused a two
hour delay in the games.

James Lincoln, director of fi-
nancial aid, was originally on the
team but was kicked off for
refusing to say anything.

Peace Day ruled discriminatory

by Alexander Haig
Ruling that Peace Day is dis-
criminatory against campus war»
mongers, President George Drake
has declared that tomorrow‘s ae-
livities will be renamed the All-
Iowa Political Ambivalence Day.
”We don’t wish to make a
political statement," said Drake.
“Peace Day was a nice concept,

but several anti-peace activists
asked to be allowed to hold their
own day.”

The petitioning group was led
by Around the Globe editor and
publisher Oliver Schultz. who
commented, “It’s a monstrous
time when only the peace advo-
cates are given a day to express

Pierce, Scﬁwar; to duel
for food service title

by Dave McConnell

Seniors Dan Schwarz and Jeff
Peirce will battle it out with
death triangles Saturday to com-
pete for the honor of Mr. Food
Service. Peirce, representing
Quad‘s best, and Schwarz, king
of Cowles, are motivated by the
top prize: the right to escort last
year‘s honorary Miss Food Scr-
vice, Annette Brown, at the the
Miss Food Service USA pageant
later this fall.

lenger, was allowed to pick the
weapon for the upcoming con-
test. He choose death triangles at
30 paces. Among choices not
picked were sharpened asparagus
tips and plastic squirt containers
for milk.

The duel will commence at
noon on Saturday. Diners at this
time are warned to wear aprons
and baseball caps to protect

 

 

themselves from the flying food,

their political position, particur
larly when Grinnell College pur-
ports to be open-minded to all
ends of the political spectrum. . .
It was inevitable that this 50*
called "Peace Day“, like commu-
nism, would fall.“

Former Peace Day organizer
Stem: Hingtgen declared, “This is
the most idiotic decision the ad
ministration has ever made.
Rather than supposedly discrimir
natc against one group, the col-
legc has restricted established
rights.”

Drake responded by explainr
ing that changing the rule would
open the college to lawsuits.

To protest the decision, stu-
dents are planning a demonstra»
tion on the Nollen House front
lawn.

Dupe revealed

A Scarlet and
Black confession

by Barbara Brown and the rest of

- the Scarlet (trial Black staff

Traditionally, every year the
Scarlet and Blue puts out one
“gag" issue, containing fake (and
we hope humorous) articles. The
gag issue used to coincide with
Relays weekend; now it comes
with Peace Day. This is that is-
sue.

We, the staff of the Scarlet
andBlack, felt that because of the
issue’s "gag" nature, and because
of the day’s theme of peace, this
would be an appropriate time for
us to make peace with you, our
readers, and let you know of a
“gag" we have been conducting
all year. We refer to “Mike
Kent’s" column. “Against the
Grain,“ which is, in fact, con
ceived and written almost every
week by the Scarlet and Black
staff. We extend this article as
part explanation, part apology.
Moreover, we write it because we
feel it is necessary to bring to a
graceful ending a joke that has
run its course and, to a great ex-
tent, served its purpose. It is
also time, for reasons we shall
explain, that the campus know
the truth.

The idea to create “Mike
Kent” came during our final staff
meeting of last year. As is usual
at that time of year, we were be-
moaning the fact that there sim-
ply wasn’t much happening on
this campus. There was no
news, nothing for us to write
about. Someone made the come
ment, half-jokingly. that it was
up to us, then, to make news.
Well, we couldn‘t exactly make
real news, but we could create
controversy (which is almost as
good). Controversy stirs people
up, pisses them off, gets them to
write letters to the editor. And a
controversial columnist. as we
well know. really gets people
frothing at the mouth: witness
the late (of this campus) Paul
Draus. It's as simple as this:
when people froth, they write
letters: when they write letters,
we get enough copy to fill the
paper. Bingo. Instant “news."

You lnust admit that even
though we were deceitful about
“Against the Grain”‘s author, we
never were deceitful about its
purpose: to piss people off. As
we had “Mike Kent" write in our
first column of the year, “A lot
of people are really going to hate
this column. That’s the whole
point. . , The idea is: whatever
opinion is held by the majority
will be the opposite of the one
expressed in this column. . . Ex-
pect to start hating my guts next
wee 3’

In ”Mike Kent," with the
slancc we had him take, we had
created the perfect figure of cone
troversy: a guy whose opinions
were purposely outrageous and
offensive. But the fact that we
had him admit that was his pur»
pose, the fact that he explicitly
invited attack of his ideas and
“person,“ infuriated people even
more because they knew that if
they were to respond and get an-
gry, they would be playing right
into his hands, ”Mike Kent“ was
our “Catch-22“ columnist: he
wanted you to hate him. and you
wanted to hate him, but you
Couldn't, because that‘s what he
wanted. With “Mike Kent“ we
had the quintessential asshole.
Recall some of these column
topics:

' Sept. 9, 1988: Defense and
Assertion of the Rights of Top-
40 Music. (Give us a break. It
was our ﬁrst column.)

' Sept. 23, 1988: Oppression of
the Great White Male. (We
thought it was kind of an inter-
esting topic: a member of the
majority whining about not get-
ting the attention that members
of minorities get even though,
through no fault of his own, he
himself wasn’t oppressed. Our
“jealous sibling" column.)

° Nov. 11, 1983: A Penny for
Your Thoughts/$500 for Your
Baby. (This was really our finest

Protest schedule created in wake of

near-riot on Nollen House lawn

by Don Smith .

Because of a recent increase in
the number of student-run
protests, Grinnell College presi-
dent George Drake announced that
all demonstrations on the Nollen
House lawn must be scheduled on
the college calendar.

Drake‘s announcement comes
after Monday’s confusion and
near-riot, when protesters op-
posed to Drake’s sameasex off-
campus-housing decision and
demonstrators opposed to his cor
habitation decision squared off on
the lawn.

Matt Maeho, organizer of the

off-campus-housing demonstra
tion, said, “We were here firstand
had already set up. In fact, we
had begun our first chorus of
‘Hey. he, hey ho. . .‘ when that
other group arrived.”

What ensued was a pitched
battle for Nollen House. Regis~
trar Roger Lasley said, “The
noise was deafening. We were
trying to work on prerregistmtion
packets. . .It was complete
chaos.” Others inside Nollen
House agreed. Executive Vice
president of the college Waldo

,Walker lamented, “I was talking

to a reporter from U.S. New: and
World Report. Our ranking is
sure to go down now.”

Only limited damage was
sustained to the lawn and to the
building itself. Two windows
were broken, and one tree suffered
several broken branches.

In addition to ordering the
scheduling of all protests. Drake
also set a time limit of 30 min-
utes for all protests. “Otherwise,
we wouldn’t be able to fit them
all in. Remember, Grinnell be-
lieves in freedom of assembly.”
