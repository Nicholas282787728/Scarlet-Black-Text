of the Sixties. What is less visible is
that they grew up with an entirely dii-
ierent set oi rules People we looked

People we looked up to as children op-

adults, do the same today without

the early and middle Sixties. but the
Conventional American student ac-
cepted this. The antiwar movement
and the whole hippie lite style grew up
as a rebellion against social norms,
Today's anti-registration movement is
no rebellion at all. It is an imitation of
the idols 01 our youth without regard
tor their temporal situations and
motivations.
