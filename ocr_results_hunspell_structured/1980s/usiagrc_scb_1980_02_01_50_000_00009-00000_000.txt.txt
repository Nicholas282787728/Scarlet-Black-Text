 

liege-owned houses

the groups which most seem to meritl
a house.

Once your group makes the cut, the ,
tun has just begun. in mid-April, -
beiore the regular room draw, the
groups approved tor the olfacampus
houses meet tor the all important
drawing to determine who gets which
house,

The atmosphere at the drawing is
charged with excitement and terror,
Since the houses vary in capacity, it is
possible under the straight draw for a
group oi 12 to suddenly tind itseli leit
with a house which only holds nine. Or
a group oi nine may tind itseli leit
with the option to take a house they do
not prefer or to expand their number
so they may occupy a house for 12. It's
a crazy game.

There are a few miscellaneous facts
you should know in addition to the
above rendition, If the housing situa»
tinn on campus is not too tight, 1002
Park Street may revert to iaculty
housing, according to Susan Wittpenn.
The house is presently the nihilistic
Dada House Coop and it is located
across the street from Grinnell House;
the small white frame house is
reputedly one or the oldest in Grinnell,

Wittpenn outlined some of the items
groups should address in their written
proposals. First, you should clearly

define your projectiwho are the peo»
ple in your group and why you and
your iriends want a house. For examr
pie, it you are a member or the
dulcimerrplaying, Esperaiitorspeaking,
vegetarian lepidopterists you might
call your group Butterfly House, and
tell the Housing Committee you need a
house of your own so everyone can
practice their dulcimers without
bothering anyone. You might add that
with your own house, you and your
lriends could very conveniently land
to each other’s mutual edification)
cook vegetarian cuisxnc while convers»
ing about Monarchs in Esperanto.

A second item which should be ad-

dressed is to explicitly outline the
goals oi your house and how you plan
to achieve them In the case of But»
tertly House, you could say you want
to lament the interchange of
knowledge in entomology, etymology,
and epicureanism. It is a good idea to
include in this part oi the proposal a
discussion at exactly how your coop
will function: who cooks and when,
how you will shop, who cleans up, and
so on The Housing Committee will
ask you about your co—op plans
whether or not you include'it in your
written proposal, so be prepared,

The best way to find out about the
specifics of running a co-op is to pay a
visit to the existing co-op5'and survey
the different ways they work. In the
end, you should try to make your pro-

posal as clear and speciiic as possible
because the committee looks more
iavorabiy on the projects which show
the group has put in some time and
thought into what they want to do.

it there are only iive houses to come
pete tor this year, the draw may be a
bidding draw rather than a straight
draw, In the straight draw, every
group picks a number and whoever
picks number one goes iirst.
regardless oi size, then the number
two group picks, and three, and so on
with the groups expanding and cone
tracting as need be to meet the re
quirements of house capacity,

Under a bidding draw, the houses
are set on the block, so to speak, and
interested groups draw tor each
house. It 1205 Park Street is on the
block, and there are three groups oi 12
bidding [or it, the three draw
numbers. whoever pulls the best
number gets the house; the two losers
go on to draw for the next house that
can hold 12. So it goes until everyone
is squeezed into the houses.

We have been reierring to coop pro-
jects, but the Housing Committee also
awards houses to ordinary cohops. it
you are a member oi a crew oi French
chefs who would like to cook together-
and live othcampus then you and your
pals can apply for a non-project co-op.

The number of houses that will be . _
project houses or co-op houses is _
determined by the ratio of the two to
each other. it ten projects apply and
live co-ops apply, then the Housing- :
Committee will award twice as many-
project houses as coups. ii there are ‘
six houses to be awarded, then such a
ratio would result in tour being pron}.
jects, two co-ops '

A final word. Be aware that while
you may save up to 100 percent on
tood costs compared to the current . .
FOG rate, you have to take into the
account the extra time you have to put
in to cook and perform other house
duties. it also costs otfrcampus
dwellers $50 extra per year to live in
the corops. This money is placed into a
separ ate account irom dorm tees and
is used {or house upkeep and repla
ment or appliances treirigeratoi
stoves, vacuum cleaners, et all).

Last year only seven groups app ed
for Coops and projects. Wittpenn ex
pressed an ambivalence about the
possibility or increased competitic
for the houses, On the one hand, she’
said She likes to be able to “make
everybody happy." With more gi-o ps
competing, some worthy projects and
cohops may go by 'he wayside, On the
other hand, she admits, “It would be
good, exciting," to have more people
participating in the process. . '

everyone, but for tlit n inn-tired FOG-
