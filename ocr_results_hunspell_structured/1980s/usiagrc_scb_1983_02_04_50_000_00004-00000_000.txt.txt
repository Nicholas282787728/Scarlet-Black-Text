Royal Winnipeg Ballet
Administrative
faux pas?

Unless you were of the 294 students who braved the ticket line, you
probably will not be seeing the Royal Winnipeg Ballet perform tonight.
Thirty—five minutes after ticket distribution began, all available tickets
were gone.

At first, the arrangement seemed unfair — a lot of faculty and staff
(172) received tickets, while a lot of students did not, Students had
classes, couldn’t wait in line, couldn‘t get tickets.

Many students have complained bitterly:

“Why didn‘t they schedule a second performance?"

“It’s not fair that faculty members each get two tickets; most of them
have already seen ballet.”

“More of us should get to go; after all, it is our money that’s paying
for the performance."

It’s misinformed attitudes like these that have caused unnecessary
feelings of bitterness concerning this event among members of the
campus community. .

For starters, it’s not “our” money that‘s paying for the ballet, Accor-
ding to Chairman James Kissane, this performance is sponsored by the
Public Events Committee, which plans cultural events of special
significance for the community. Separate from the student events com-
mittees (films and concerts), the Public Events Committee designs ac-
tivities for the general public, not just the students.

Appropriately, its funding is a separate item in the budget, with its
funds allocated by Executive Vice President Waldo Walker, Like
everything from maintenance costs to professor’s salaries, you can say
this money ultimately comes out of student money, but it does not come

_ directly from the student activity fund.

A grant from ‘the Affiliated States‘ Arts Agency for the Upper
Midwest provides approximately 20 percent of die funds needed for the
ballet, Part of the stipulation in receiving this grant is that the perfor~
mance be open to the general publi . Feeling angry that you “didn’t get
your money‘s worth” is not a just ed reaction.

The bitterness over the absence of a second performance is also un-
warranted. Even with the public grant, the committee could not come
close to affording a second performance It would be nice, but it’s just
not possible.

Admittedly, were Roberts Theater capable of seating more people,
more students would be able to see the performance. But, obviously,
such is not the case; inadequate facilities in terms of seats and stage
undeniably exist,

The system of ticket distribution unquestionably needed improve»
ment, But at a school this size, at any size, no system seems entirely
equitable, and the lack of tickets was acutely felt this time since
students usually never even consider the possibility of doing without
one. At future events of this magnitude, possibly designating a certain
number of tickets for students and faculty could alleviate some prod
blems,

At the heart of the matter lies the question whether some “injustice"
has been committed simply because less man one-ﬂiird of the student
body will be able to attend the ballet. Making a value judgment on a
well-intended action does not seem quite appropriate. The committee
obviously wants to bring the best possible entertainment to the largest
possible number. Yet it’s still a shame the limitations with which it
must deal prohibits it from doing that effectively

To the Editor:

Looking at the past semester, I have
found that the word “responsibility"
means to many hall representatives
nothing more than a necessity to sit on
their posteriors for two hours each'
Wednesday night while performing in
practically no responsible manner what
soever. Too many representatives choose
to fight legislation which would make their
role more ideologically viable, For in-
stance, many members were adamantly
opposed to adding to their posted weekly
minutes their voting record and personal
comments about issues pending iuture
Joint Board approval. This legislation
should cause them no irritation, not only
because they should be glad to inform their
dorm members about the controversial
issues in Joint Board (and certainly about
the controversies over What to do with the
students' money), but also because the act
of adding one’s upinons etc. to the minutes
can’t take longer than the time it takes to
think of them. It's a Sad state of affairs
when the hall representatives don't even
take time to think.

it is to this issue of responsibility that
many members, llke myself, have paid
strict attention. In the last semester many
programs were introduced to help in
crease the hall presidents involvement
wiﬂi students in hopes to make the
representative process more active and
viable; the agenda must now be posted in
the Post. Office at least 24 hours before
each meeting to allow interested in»
dividuals to be informed prior to the
meeting and to promote discussions about
many issues which will influence the
representatives' votes. Also, as discussed
above, all representatives are strongly adz
vised to write a brief personal comment on
H18 posted minutes in ﬂ'ieir dormitories.
Third, a booklet which is designed to in-
form the student population of all the
extrarpulitical activities and committees
which are available to students, is in its
final stages of development.

People with small minds are laying to

, waste one of their most valuable ex-

perlences in college by persistently being
sarcastic, cynical and reproachful toward
student involvement in extracurricular ac
tivities. As this booklet will make clear
when it is published, Grinnell College is
unlike most other colleges of its size
because oi the availability of personal ex-
perience alongside faculty and ad-
ministrative members, whether it be on
Joint Board, the son or any of the faculty
committees (Rosenfield, Curriculum Com-
mittee, etc.) — John Walter, off-
campus/non-college owned represen
tative.

A Reminder to Film-60ers:

Last semester, students and administra-
tion members expressed concern for the
safety of the viewing audience in ARI-l
Auditorium, especially during the showing
of “rowdier” films, Beer bottles and cans,

as well as other objects, which fall or are.

dropped from the igloony are potentially
dangerous to eve ,e seawd below.
Because of incidents which occurred in
previous semesters, SGA has instructed
projectionists to stop a film if they believe
behavior of individuals to be dangerous to
the welfare of the audience.

In order to avoid more drastic
measures, such as those prohibiting
students from bringing cans and bottles in-
to ARH Auditorium 0r restricting the
choice of films to be shown on campus, I
urge you to be considerate of your fellow
audience members. Cans are safer than
bottles, and both can be placed where they
won't be kicked or roll. Your consideration
will ensure the future unlimited choice of
films at Grinnell. — Thank you, Ruth Katz,
iilms chairperson

Letchinger’s article is a perfect exa
of the kind of attitude which prev
students and intellectuals alike from p

political and social policy, His art
reeks of elitism, if not downright snob: :
The seemingly pervasive belief on

rare in history that students and

mystery as to why H'lese occurrences

Harassment
at Grinnell

To the Editor:

While on a bakery run during finals w
last semester. 3 ramer disturbing inci-
happened to me which I would like
discuss. As a friend and I were return
from the bakery, around 3:30 a.m., a
in a car was following two female Grin
students. His harassment culminated
chasing my friend and me on central c
pus in his car.

The reason I wanted to inform the <
dent body about this incident is beca
many of us come from urban areas, .
when we arrive in Grinnell we develo
false sense of security, lsee no reason
anyone should be harassed or live in is
however, we should be cautious. Since
incident was originally directed tow
women, 1 recommend that me college
some committee reinstitute the escorts
vice. In addition, I recommend all stude
reconsider late-night excursions alone.
the future, I hope incidents such as this i
be avoided. James Amberson
