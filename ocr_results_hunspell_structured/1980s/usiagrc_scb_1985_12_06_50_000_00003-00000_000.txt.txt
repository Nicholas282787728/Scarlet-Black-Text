it was also argucd that an education major w‘ould not

prepare students adequately in ttic subyect matter they
would be teaching “It was a general agreement that in a
liberal arts school. graduate students who are going to be
cor-tiiicd should have a liberal arts major." Jones explain
ed ,
A second problem that was addressed was hotv’to give
the teaching protession greater credibility as a career
one way, both l\twe|l and Jones suggested, was to Illa
crease teacher's salaries. Furthermore, “lwe need to I try
to help students see that this indeed is a Lontrlbution that
they can make because they do not sec it as being very
rewarding." Atwell said.

Another way in which colleges could promote public
school leaching‘is to encourage advisors to suggest the
prolc sion as a viable irccix In the past. because
teaching uttered low salarie little prestige. ind tow posi-

'tlolls. Grlllnell zlilvisors tended to discourage public

teaching. according to Jones,

lioiicier. the situation is looking less bleak. “Some
good districts are trying to improve public school educa
tioii. hey are paying ticttcr salaries they are giving

As to the dcgrcc to which outside departments should
participate in teacher education. “the consensus [at the

, ACM conference] was that it is better to have closer
' coopcration between departments." Jones said

Delibs attended the conference to address yet another
problem. how to improve the quality oi the writing at
students who come out at publ’ chools. according to
Jones It was suggested that writing workshops could be
established to improve students' writing.

laltlnil'sloclt iron] the situation

on lissaoiicii Press .
The number oi collcges and universities

moving to sell at least some 01 their stock
in companies with ties to South Ali-lea is up
sharply this year. though schools with the
largest endowments are still reluctant to
take the step.

The preliminary results at a study by the
Investor Responsibility Research Center.
a group that monitors business activity in
South Alrica. show that. 29 schools have
divested all of their stock in South African»
related compan and another 44 have
divested part or ,

Forty at those 13 institutions made their
decision this year. as pressure has grown
to sell off such holdings as an expression of
opposition to South Africa's apartheid
system or racial sepa huh and denial oi
political rights to blacks.

The value of all stock divested is $292
mlllien, said Chris Cannes. a researcher
[or the center. which is based in
Washington.

David Hauck nior research analyst at
the center. said. “There are a lot. more
universities considering their investment
policy toward U.S. companies With inc
vestments in South Africa. The humber of
unlverstlles willing to adopt total divestr
ment policies is also up. They're tending to
be the larger. more prestigious unit/err
sities." .

There is also a trend toward divestment
among pension limds operated by states
and cities. which control tar more money
than the collcg .thc center said At least
to states and .32 cities have some kind or
divestment policy

New Jersey. tor example, has more than
are billion in its state employee retirement
system, and it is selling some $2 billion in
South Alrlcarrelated investments as a
result at a state divestment law passed in
August, Mr. Coones said.

or the 100 universities with the largest
endowments. about onerlhird have laken
some divestment step. according to the
study, but only live have totally divested.

. Columbia University's trustees voted
last month to sell the university's $39
million in stock in Us companies that do
business in South Alrica. making it the
lirst tvy League school to take the step.

it is also the only one oi the schools with
the to largest endowments to totally
divest. Mr. Coones said. Harvard, with a
$2.5 billion endowment, the nation's
largest. has selectively divested.

Besides Columbia. others With the
largest endowments that are totally
divesting are the State Ulliverstty oi New
York; Rutgers, the University ol Wlsconr
sin system and Mount Holyokc. according
to the center's study.
