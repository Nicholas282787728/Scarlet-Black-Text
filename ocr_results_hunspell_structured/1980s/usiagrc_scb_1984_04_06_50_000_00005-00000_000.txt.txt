Minority
hiring
necessary

To the Editor:

This past Wednesday night, i at
tended my first Joint Board
meeting because, as any good
Democrat, they were discussing
an issue in which I had a personal
stake. The issue was a resolution
which addressed itself to the re
cent incidents involving the posi»
tion in AfrOVAmerican studies.

The resolution had at heart me
idea that discrimination. whether
direct or reverse, should not be
encouraged by this institution.
And, i. a Black American and an
African by birth, am glad the
resolution failed. I felt that the
resolution was ill-timed and ad
dressed itself to a situation which
the Joint Board as a functioning
entity had not taken the time to
examine beyond the pages of the
S&B.

I do not condone discrimination
but, as contradictory as it may ap
pear. I tirmly believe that this "1*
stitution should seek out blacks
and only blacks for now and in the
future to iill this particular posi-
tion. Note that’I did not specify
every position on this campus:
just one, My reasoning being that
the position was created to bring
Blackness, Negro tradition, the
Black aesthetic, or whatever you
choose to label it to this campus. A
campus which in 1973. when black
students took over the library
demanding among other things an
increase in black faculty, had five
black professors and today has on»
ly one tenured and one currently
Visiting.

This is the same school which
spouts that it is the home oi
liberalism. This is the school with
diversity.

Grinnell has a policy of admit-
ting a certain number of South
African students each year to give
them a needed break and to create
diversity on this campus lbesides
enhancing the liberal veneer) Brc
inging in a black professor seems
to be no different than bringing in
a South African, unless it‘s that
South Africa is further away than
South Chicago and easier to objecc
tify. Probably more than any
white students, the black studean
of Grinnell would hate to see an
undorqualiiied proiessor in the
position. but we would like to see
at least a few blacks somewhere
on this campus other than in the
prospective handouts

Aside from the facts of history
which stand for themselves, my
main objection to the resolution is
that it fosters the illusion that:
Grinnell is wonderful and liberal
and no one is discriminated
against and no one is ignored and
everyone is happy and peace and
love, so the world must be that
way. I choose not to bury my head
in the sand and i hope that my
fellow students do not either, 7

Alum

Dentel

To the Editor:

i worked With Georgia Dentel in
the midrsixties when I was SGA
president I doubt her job has
changed much, except that it has
probably gotten tougher since (1)
the student activities budget
doesn’t appear to have kept pace
with inflation and (2) the cost oi
bringing ﬁrst-class entertainment
to Grinnell has probably gone up
even faster than inflation

At any rate, I regard her as a
true talent whose skill and ex-
perience are by nature such as to
almost certainly be overlooked
and undervalued at Grinnell. Her
job is to fish for affordable gems
in the suspect waters oi proics
sional pop culture — a world most
Grinnell scholars don't unders-
tand and vaguely disdain, No
wonder she is often unappreciated
and misunderstood, even after 23
years,

Not appreciating is one thing,
but halving her salary is quite
another. It's not just odd (your
word). it’s shabby. Any explana
tion of economic necessity has the
ring of falsehood. even at this
distance. In any case, it is the sort
of stupid mistake that college ad-
ministrators occasionally make in
the long winter season. But I exV
pect it is one that can and will be
rectified easily and without any
lasting hard feelings once the
fresh breath oi spring brings a few
people to their senses.

Talented and interested
students may do a lot of the
legwork from time to time. but
Ms. Dentel provides the continuity
of experience and a national
reputation to back them up and
actually to make things happen
She also had (and presumably
still has) a real openness and
adaptability to student ideas and
initiatives with merit.

Location is both an advantage
and a disadvantage for Grinnell,
Certainly it is oi major interest to
every prospective student I've
ever talked with. Its relative isola
tion gives Grinnell a chance to do
its work of instilling values and
imparting knowledge in enough
seclusion to make an extraorr
dinary amount stick. That’s a
plus. But anyone who has been
anywhere else knows that the Col-
lege labors under a sizeable com-
petitive disadvantage when it
comes to attracting variety and
talent because of its perceived
isolation from the cross-currents
of contemporary culture Georgia
Dentel's work has done a lot to
counter that perception,

Frankly. i love Grinnell and
what it stands for, but I would
honestly find it very difficult to
recommend the College to another
prospective student, no matter
how good its academic program,
without knowing that a Georgia
Dentel was going to be there to
make things happen 7 to water
the Midwest farmlands with occa-

sional drops of folk. rock, pop or
jazz. it really disturbs me to see
her and her eiiorts not only under
rated but undercut as well. It’s
bad for her. but it’s worse for

S&B ignored
Rusher

To the editor.

As the member of the Rosen-
iield committee responsible ior
the proposal to invite william
Rusher to speak on campus. i feel
bound to reply to your article oi
March 16, 1984 entitled “Panel
Discusses Rusher's ‘Narrow
View'".

It is my estimation that. if
anything, Mr. Rusher’s address
galvanized support for the nuclear
freeze movement at Grinnell,
Though i am not cveryoyed at this
development. it is enough for me
to know that at least the Grinnell
community had heard both sides,
and had chosen according to the
dictates of their consciences. leav~
ing history to judge the worthiness
of their ideals,

With this in mind. it was with
extreme displeasure that i read
the abovecmentloned article. I (eel
it below the usual standard of the
Scarlet and Black to devote tour
columns of print to why William
Rusher is wrong, while denying
his visit a single word oi the
coverage usually given to other
scholars' convocation speakers
like Bobby Seale,

I realize that Mr. Rusher's
schedule made it impossible for
you to interview him prior to your
March 14 deadline. Yet it seems to
me that this in no way prevented
you from devoting the coverage to
Mr. Rusher that you have given to
other speakers . coverage which
often occurs in the next week's
issue, Certainly, Mr. Rusher’s opic
nions were controversial enough
to warrant a few brief
paragraphsi

I do not write this letter to "11'
pugn the line coverage of the
event given by Ms. Piekalkiewicz,
or the good coverage of campus
events usually given by the
Scarlet and Black, I simply Wish
too decry this notable lapse in
evenhandedness, and pray that
S&B readers shall not suffer from
its recurrence — laii Mchaii
