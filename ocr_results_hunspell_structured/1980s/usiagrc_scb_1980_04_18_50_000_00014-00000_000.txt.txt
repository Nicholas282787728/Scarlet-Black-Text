Dear Mark, 4/ 12
Glad to hear that you’re back at
Grinnell, Your Father and I have been
talking and we think it might be good
if you transferred to the University of
Illinois and became an accounting ma
jor. Opportunities are great, and you
would get a job as soon as you
graduated. I hope we won’t get any
disagreement from you on this. I

couldn't get a check out this month
but we'll get me money to you after
we hear rrom you on this. Maybe.
Love,
The Family
P.S. Your dog misses you.

Dear Folks, 5/15
Guess you’re right. Accounting
won‘t be so bad. Maybe I'll find what
I'm looking for in that.
Fondly,
Mark

,Afrock grows in Brooklyn

Prospective Rock Weekened was a
total success! The directors are pleased
to announce that a rock has been in-
terviewed, selected, and invited to
campus as a iinalist tor the position of
our class monument

Now at this point one asks “Where
did you find a big rock" in Iowa? "

Going on the assumption that if the
Class of 1380 could get a rock to cam-
pus we could too, Brian Jones Bob
Lewis, and this New Yorker with the aid
0. a hot tip, drove off toBrookIyn, Iowa

Much to our distress we found no
rocks, much less a rock from Burling
Lawn, However, while driving through
quaint downtown Brooklyn. Bob
suggested we relax and experience an
essential aspect of small town Iowa
Iifwa malt at the local drug store,

The scenein the drug store was much
as one would expection one side oi the
store, greeting card racks and shelves
of cosmetics. on the other, a counter
with stoolsluThe crowd was also what
one would .expectia young woman

Brian.

Silence in the drug store.

“What?" giggled the young woman,
as we received looks Irom everyone in
the place.

“Well, er.‘ it's this landscaping
project we’re working on." I timidly
allowed, attempting to save our
Credibility, and with that Bob, Brian,
and l carefully explained our project,

By this time we had ﬁnished our
malts and were waiting tor our change
at the cash register, when the young
fellow who had been sipping collee at
the end of the counter asked. “Do you
guys really want a rock"

“We certainly do. we're serious
about this," I responded

He paused and held his Chin in his
hand. “Out back behind the tool shed at
our old farm there was this rock. but
my dad sold the [arm a while back. l
don‘t know ii it's still there. If it is.
maybe the farmer Will let you have it."

“Well how about we take a drive out
to this tarm and have a look at this
rock," I suggested.

The young man agreed, so we piled

 

“There it was, bellintl the tool shed—

a big, well-textured granite rock —

inst wlint we liad dreamed of."

 

behind the counter, with an older
woman watching to make sure she
didn't serve up too much ice cream
Down‘ the counter sat a young man in
his mid twenties sipping coere. elderly
couples strolled in and out oI the drug
store,— perhaps pausing tor a word or
two with the older woman behind the
counter on this slow, sunny Saturday
afternoon.

“dehat are the three of you doing in
Brooklyn?” asked the young woman as
we were enjoying our malts.

“We’re looking {or a rock," answered

into Brian's car and drove out to
Kriegel's farm, iust east at Brooklyn.
There it was. behind the tool shedia
big, well-textured granite rock~just
what we had dreamed of. As luck would
have it, Farmer Kriegel was out tilling
the earth from which this rock came. So
we trooped across the barnyard.
around the pond, and out to the field he
was plowing. Seeing four young men
ominously blocking his path, the far
mer stopped his tractor, hopped out.
and said with a smile, “This looks like
trouble."

Our lriend introduced us and I said,

P.S Could you send me $15 (or a
haircut?

Dear Mark, 5/17

Expecting you on the atternoon oi the

“Sir, we are very interested in the rock
out behind your tool shed.”

“Yes, we'd like it very much.” Brian
added,

A look of coniusion came across the
lace oi the farmer, but we quickly
explained our project and the
momentous historical tradition we
were involved in and he gleamed with
understanding. “Why, you boys can
have that rock and any other rocks you
tind on my property.”

with that we shook hands and
triumphantly returned to Grinnell

“Boulder" than ever, we are back at
