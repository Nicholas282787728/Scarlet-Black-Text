Student Forewarns of Mass Exodus

To the Editor:

Let me make a prediction. I
know, i could be wrong. Predic-
tions are dangerous, harmiul, evil,
blah, blah, blah... Well. at least let
megiveitatr Okay,hei-eitgoes:

The administration will start
seeing a sharp increase in the
number of students transferring
irom Grinnell to other, larger in-
stitutions among the present and
the upcoming freshman classes.

whew, now that wasn‘t so bad.
was it’! Now, just give mea chance
to back It up. The number or ap-
plicants to Grinneil sharply in»
creased both this year andJast
year; thus Admissions had to be
much more selective in choosing
the members of the irahman
class.

What attracted these students?
Among a lew: a beautiiul library,
a good computer system, _an ex-
citing social life, and an amazing
(and expensive) campaign to pro
mote a positive new image of Grin-
nell

What will they iind when they arr
rive? A iaculty made up oi many
iirst and second- -year prois who
lack the experience to teach a

bright student body, relatively
small introductory classes (com-
pared to larger institutions) yet a
very limited selection of upper
level courses ldue to 3/2), and an
administration which will only hire
three new prois due to the stock
market crash yet is willing to
spend literally millions of dollars
on the renovation of ARI-i, the new
student building, and landscaping,
Finally, they will iind a student
body that is so damn passive that
they simply sit back and accept
what is happening. what happened
to the radical and militant Grinnell
oi the ’60: and ’70:?

what will happen to them? I
know that I am not the only
ireshman who is thinking about
staying here ior two years in order
to take the needed introductory
courses, and then transierring to a
larger school with a more Varied
and larger selection oi upperrlevel
classes,

This is not a call to arms for the
student body, but rather a pitiiul
plea to the administration to turn
around its current policies in order
to keep what promises to be one oi

Ho'useniates Sliggest
Marnuana as Fund- Raiser

To the Editor:

As my housemates and I sat
around chatting about world pro»
blems the subject of the GrinnCll
endowment came up, We were in
quisitive towards it, How much
money do they really have? How
good is the interest? ii lhe endow»
ment is so great why do our tuir
lions rise yearly, We quickly
realized that there are problems
with the endowment.

So we set upon the subyect with
the Vigor characteristic of Grinnell
students, After hours of minds
wrenching-debate and discussion

we’finally came'up witha solution: .

college sold drugs.

lithe college bought marijuana
en grosse at the cost oi say 3100 a
pound it could then sell it to
students for $30 a quarter ounce.
The proiit would be 51.72» a pound.
According to Blair Kolb the school
smokes about loo pounds oi dope a
year, If we assume no increase in
demand the school would make
$172,000 a yearl This money could
pay the tuition oi ten Grinnel]

students. It could help fund the new
student center. In short it could he
put to a number of very good uses.

However. not only would the
whole community be beneiited but
the average student would be bet»
ter oil as well. A quarter ounce at
today's prices costs between $35 to
:75. Thus most people would save
up to $45. The money saved could
be used to buy books or to fund
charities. Indeed the entire
economy would be better. The
lowered price would has money
that‘could be saved. a source oi
capital. unspent, thus stimulating
industrial growth,

Administrators. iaculty and
alumni please consider this pro
posal, In today's world of rising
costs new methods of obtaining
iunds must be developed

be a decline in the alcohol problem
and a corresponding decline in the
suicide attempt rate.

Bookstore
Pricing
Policy
Criticized

To the Editor:

I realize that I could have gone to
the bookstore, asked ior the person
in charge oi pricing, and spoken to
that person. However, I reel it is
more appropriate to use the
newspaper in order to share my
complaint with more people. The
pricing policy at the campus
bookstore is looming more and
more ridiculous each semester. I
do not object to the fact that I have
had to pay at least $220 each oi my
four semesters at Grinnell — not
directly. What does incense me.
however is the fact that the
bookstore believes it can sneak ex~
aggerated prices by the students.
Two examples quickly come to
mind. This semester. I was re-
quired to buy a particular book ior
German and a particular book ior

'humanities lalong.with mother , e

books). The price originally mark~
ed on the German book was 530M.
The bookstore marked it at $5.80.
The problem is that the original
price is in German marks. while
the new price is in us dollars.
One need only to look in the
business section of the Des Moines
Register to see that one can
receive almost two German marks
(or one US. dollar. making the
price on the German book close to
a lot) percent mark up ior were we
supposed to believe that there ck-
isted no diiierence in price bet-
ween the two?) The story on the
humanities book is just as wonder-
iui. The price marked on the book
was originally $5.95. But the
bookstore found it necessary to
placc Penguin stickers on the
books. covering up the old price.
and leaving a new purchasing
price oi $9 95.

The claim has been heard
around campus that the personis)
in charge of book pricing "don't
think they are making a profit.”
This is outrageous! Since the
bookstore is not possibly purchass
ing books at their originally mark
ed price _ which is their suggested
retail price 7 they are making one
hell of a prolil oii of the sales. I am
