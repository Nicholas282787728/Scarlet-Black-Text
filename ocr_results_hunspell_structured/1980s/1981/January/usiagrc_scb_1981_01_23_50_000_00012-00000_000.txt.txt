' portrayed as a serious sort, with a prac-

tical major like engineering or com-

puter’ science, an eye on a secure finan-

cial future and an interest only in those

extracurricular activities that involve
massive quantities of beer.

But there are now clear signs that at
least a few students are taking a less
serious but more sophisticated look at
campus life through the familiar guise
of the campus humor magazine.

‘The latest survey 01 student publica
tions, conducted by U. of
Massachusetts-Amherst Professor
Dario Politella, lists only 21 humor
publications nationwide, but those ins
valved in making college students
laugh say interest is booming.

“There are a lot oi new ones coming
out now and some older ones being
revived," said Howard Gershen, editor
of Columbia U.'s Jester and ctr-founder
with Joey Green from Cornell U. oi the
National Association of College Humor
Magazines. Two years ago, Gershen
and Green tried contacting about 100
campus humor publications that were
listed in the 1970 book, A Century of Col-
lege Humori They sent out about 901ete
ters, and after doing tollowup work,
ultimately contacted 34 publications,
said Gershen.

“College humor magazines hit a real
slump in the mid-705," Gershen said.
“They had grown more political, locus-
ing on Watergate and Vietnam. By
1973-74, all of a sudden they were left on
a ledge without a ladder to get down."
At Columbia, for example. the Jester‘s
student fee funding was taken away,
and for the 197$“ school year, "it was
only a few little mimeograph sheets
that were passed around,” said Ger-
shen.

In 1975, “Saturday Night Live"
brought a new style of humor to the
forefront, said Gershen, With political
activism no longer dominating the cam~
puses, humor began its revival. He
believes college magazines really gain-
ed strength, however, when the quality
of SNL and other national humor
sources, like the National Lampoon,
began 00 decline. "We fill that void.” he
said. "If something strong comes along
nationally now, college humor
magazines will go down again."

Much oi the current revival is taking
place on the East Coast, and particular
1y at Ivy League and New York schools.
The Harvard Lampoon, the oldest con-
tinuous campus humor magazine, re-
mains strong, as do the Princeton
Tiger, and magazines at Cornell, Cole
gate, New York u., the u. of Penn-
sylvania and the u. at Michigan, said
Gershen.

Predictably, the growth in these
magazines has produced a growth in
complaints and administrative at-
tempts to curtail the often outrageous
collegiate sense of humor. Publication
of the Stanford U. Chaparral was
suspended for several months after
stali‘ members snuck a phony obituary
for the campus bowling team into the
student newspaper. At St. John‘s U., the
Common Good was kicked off campus
by the university president {or using a
blasphemous sentence in a take—off oi a
university publication.

Solemnity does not prevail at other
campuses, however. The Chaparral is
back, while the Common Good staff
regrouped this year to form a new on.
campus publication, The Spectator.
The magazine does operate under
restrictions, said Spectator Editor
Joanne Griffin. “We can't print
anything contrary to Catholic doctrine,
or anything racist, sexist or against any
religion. A lot of topics are simply off-
limits to us," she explained.

Most college humor knows no limits

e in tact, that is probably the single
element distinguishing it lrom general
humor. "College magazines can get
away with more, because they don’t
have to worry about oilending
subscribers and advertisers," said Bret
Watson of the Princeton Tiger‘.
"Overall, though, I think it does reilect
the humor or the times, We're very lrr
reverent, but lately, all humor is Ir-
reverent."

Gershen advances the theory that col-
lege magazines set the trends {or na-
tional humor. "The humor of colleges
today will become the national humor
tomorrow, as our audiences grow up,"
he said.

The "state of the art" in college
humor will be a major topic of discus-
sion when the National Association of
College Humor Magazines meet Feb.
1922 at Columbia U, Those involved

T.V. related to eating habits

Warning: A Rutgers bnivcrsity study
has Iound that watching televismn can
be harmful to your health.

Not surprismgly, the recent study by
a communications prolessor shows that
television promotes had eating habits.

What is surprising, however, is that
the real culprits indicated in the study
weren't the commercials that push
sugar-tilled solt drinks, gooey junk
lood, or mass-produced hamburgers,
but prime time programs themselves

Lois Kaufman. an assistant professoi
ol communications. iound that [or
every relerence to "nonrnulr 'ous locd
items" in commercials, there were two
such references in top-rated programs.

Characters in prime tinin shows almost
never eat regular nicals, grabbing
snacks on the run instead, according to
the Kaulmaii study, Empty caloric

represented in the programs, and all
eating is done to lullill a psychological

More women“ attend college

The good news [or amorous young
college males is that they're now out-
numbered on campus by women,

The bad news tor young college men
is that a growing proportion oi those
women are age 35 or over.

A recent United States Census
Bureau report shows that in 1979 there
were more women than men attending
college tor the lust tulle since World
