nelavs-a Inumns Ill)!

To quote a cliche (which is, after all, a writer’s best friend) a pic-
ture is worth a thousand words. With this in mind let us direct your
attention to this week’s cover.

As you remember back to the haze that envelops your memory of
last weekend‘s activities, let us take this opportunity to offer some
retrospective thoughts of the event.

The 1981 version of the Grinnell Relays was an unquestionable suc»
cess. Because of that extra effort put forth towards organization, H.
Wayne Moyer, Wes Kennedy and all the rest of the Relays Commit»
tee truly provided an excellent diversion for the students.

This year’s Relays yielded plenty of opportunity to have a good
time and forget, for a while, the pressures we face this time of year.
Admittedly, 24 kegs of beer didn’t hurt.

We applaud the Committee’s efforts and enthusiasm and hope its
actions will set a precedent for future Relays.
