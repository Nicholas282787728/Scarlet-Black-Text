rooms. They are perhaps one ol the
reasons Stoops said the house was
described as having ”a rosy at~
mosphere" when it was built.

Behind the parlors is a room which

used to be a porch but has been closed
in to provide a space to keep the Society
tiles and more displays. Several Seth
Thomas clocks ornament the tops of
shelves tilled With Oriental shoes and
slippers given by Grinnell residents.
The room also has a desk which is sup
posed to have belonged to Harry
Hopkins rather. A scarl printed in
England in 1381 sits atop the desk. Pic~
tured on the scart are the aspirations
Women's Rights Societies had for the
year test. It shows women in the army,
in politics. as judges and scientists. The
men displayed on the scarf are out of
Jobs or doing housework.
-, The kitchen is equipped with all die
latest conveniences up to about the
19305. 'he retrigerator was made in the
early 1305 by the Grinnell Washing
Machine Company. There is also a
dishwashing machine which is over 50
years old.

The basement contains exhibits at
.various war helmets. spinning wheels.
:Indian artilacts. laundry equipment
and old tools. The memorabilia ol
:Willlam lBilly) Robinson covers one of
the basement walls, Robinson was an
iearly aviator in Grinnell who died in a
crash a few miles southwest of Grinnell
irl l9l6.

A display case holds a cross section
train a branch of a tree that Horace
Greeley planted in Grinnell. When
Grinnell was lounded there was not a
tree within three miles oi town, Stoops
says as she points to pictures ol trees
newly planted along the streets.

Stopping in the dining room, Stoops
tells of how she bought back some of the
Mclviurray's original carpeting at the
house auction, The rug m the dining
room was restored to the place it had
occupied tor years, The worn edges
give evidence oi the amount ot Service
the room saw.

, Upstairs are six more rooms and a
bathroom. One room is used as a toy
room. It is lull of dolls, carriages, china
on sets and sets of carved animals.
Behind the toy room is a smaller room
furnished (or a child with a low bed with
rails. One of me two bedrooms is
decorated as a guest room. The room
next door is setup asa reading room as

it was when the house was a residence.
The room features an Edison
phonograph which plays cylinders. The
Edison is in as good working order as
the Victorola downstairs, Hanging on
the wall are two hair wreaths, intricate-
ly curled and twisted locks of hair
which are framed for decorative pur~
poses. A specialist told the Museum
Society the wreaths were excellent ex
amples ol the crait,

0n the bed in the housekeepers room
there is an autograph quilt which was
made in 1876 by the women of Chester
Church. It features the names 01
various townspeople and serves as a
sort of social register. The housekeeper
tor the McMurray tamily inherited the

house upon Mr. McMuiray's death and
Continued to live there afterward. They
were the only people to live in the house
before the Society bought’it.

The last room on the second floor
holds old tashioned clothing, including
a turnofrthe-century knit bathing suit.
Display cases there contain homemade
quilts. Stoops' husband, J.D. Stoops,
can be seen in a photograph ot a Grin-
nell men's club. He was a‘ professor
emeritus oi philosophy at Grinnell Cot
lege in the early part of the century.

It you go for a tour of the museum or
just to look around by yourseit, do not
forget to sign the guest book on the wet y
out, Stoops insists. After all, such
registers are a part oi history, right?
