SGA continues discussion of “F” grade

by Bob Utke

A discussion of the upcoming faculty
vote on remstating the "F" grade filled
out an otherwise short and uneventful
Joint Board meeting last Wednesday.

Vice-PreSldent Doug Rowe declared
a “quasi-committee" of the JB
members present. This allowed JB to
dispense with the formality of
parliamentary procedure so that a
more fluid discussion could occur.

Rowe brought JB up to date, explain-
ing that the “F" grade policy had failed
to pass the last meeting of the Commit-
tee on Academic Standing (CASl. The
CAS members were unable to resolve
issues concerning whether Credit/No
Credit classes should be considered
"F's if the student receives a No
Credit, ll failure in a freshman tutorial
should be dealt with as any other "F"
and when to set the deadline for drop-
ping a class. The popular candidates for
drop deadlines are three weeks. six
weeks or nine weeks.

Because of its inability to meet a
consensus, CAS will not be presenting
an “F" grade proposal to the faculty at
this Monday's faculty meeting.

Rowe reported that CA5 will pro-

bably call a special meeting sometime
next week to complete its proposal
Rowe said that Morris Parslow told him
that if CAS dldrl tget the proposal to the
faculty before May, it probably would
not be considered this ymr. Rowe sug-
gested that CAS may push for a special
faculty meeting this month to vote on
the “F“ grade and stated, "Dean
Catherine Frazer is apparently trying
to push it through."

President Paul Volker suggested that
a position letter be sent irom JB ex-
pressing its opinion of the policy.
George Turnbull proposed that straw
polls be taken to assess JB 5 collective
opinion, then discussions concerning
the specifics of the issues could be held.

The straw poll showed J B's sentiment
on whether 01' not the "F" grade should
be reinstated was roughly 50-50.
However, a vote taken to determine the
timing of the drop deadline showed an
overwhelming majority in favor of
making it as late as possible.

Some discussion followed concerning
the merits of earlier and later
deadlines. JB decided that it was not as
important that its letter contain a

specific deadline as it was that it ex-
plain the reasoning it held for wanting

the date later.
The decision was made to have the

cabinet draft a letter explaining that
the drop deadline should be scheduled
at such a time that the student would
have every opportunity to have receiv-
ed some evaluation of his work.
Preliminary copies of the letter will be
provided to all hail representatives so
that they may go over them with the
students in their dorms. The final draft
will then go to the faculty probably next
week.

Earlier. in the cabinet report, Student
Coordinator Teri Gould announced that
the Spring Waltz would be May 1. She
added that an ensemble from the Des
Moines Symphony had been secured for
the dance. She also mentioned that
there will be a Blood Drive April 15.16
and 17.

Social Coordinator Chris Nylander
announced that the Ray-Beats would be
playing here later this semester. In his
auditor's report, Mark McAllister an-
nounced that the general budget for .13
stands at $466.40,

Record Service boasts lower prices on albums

by Mike Alexander

Are you tired of paying outrageous
prices [or records? Have you ever
moaned about the dismal selections
that you have to choose from at stores

in Grinnell? Well stop all your futile
complaining and plan to check out Grin—
nell College‘s record serwce!

The record service is a creation of
SGA and is headed by Karyn Reif,
assistant student coordinator for SGA,
Its purpose is to allow students to pur-
chase albums at reasonable prices. A
37.93 list price LP can be bought for on»
ly ssosthrough the serVice.

Students choose their selections from
the Schwann Catalogue, a listing of
nearly every album ever released.
Once Reif has accumulated requests
totaling more than $50, she sends off the
order to “Sounds Unlimited," a major
record store in Chicago. Orders are
generally filled within three to four
days. Usually all requests can be com-
leted, unless they are either not
. vailable or are out of stock at "Sounds

nlimited."

The service, which originated lasi
ear. was much more popular first

mm, )98)

semester, when orders totaling nearly
8200 were sent out almost every 10 days.—
So far this semester has seen only two
orders placed. 'Relf attributed this to
some impatient dissatisfaction with the
service from students who aren't
familiar with how the system works,

Regardless. the service generally
provides an excellent opportunity to get
LPs without draining your entire sav-
ings. As long as the service survives,
you have no right to bitch about
bookstore prices anymore, man!
