soviet threat on me decllne'

Ironically, the fear of Soviet superiority begins to solve itself just
as an administration bent on retaliating against even the slightest
hint of Russian aggression swings into action. Granted the USSR
bears watching but recent incidents give us hope that our two coun-
tries will be brought closer by forces stronger than the Kremlin

The most obvious signs that Russia is losing its “grip” come from

V incidents in Poland and Yugoslavia, In Yugoslavia Tito was credited

with keeping some distance between his country and the USSR. But
Tito died a year ago and no take-over has occurred. In Poland we see
workers striking but the Soviets have yet to put down the rebellions
of the laborers or the farmers. In both of these countries the Kremlin
realizes that the people will not tolerate oppression any longer,
they’ve been lied to since World War II about the state of their
economy and they know that life can be better if they unite to make it
so ‘

Another indication of turmoil emanates from the Kremlin itself.
Brezhnev, the aging Soviet leader, continually suffers setbacks
because of his health. Soon another leader will be singled out, But
the Russians do not adjust to change as quickly as we who vote every
four years. In addition, a new leader can no longer be a member of
Russia’s old guard; even Brezhnev was born too late to remember
the Bolshevik revolution.

Finally, the temper of the times is beginning to take its toll on the
Russian citizens, Much of the Soviet population has heard for years
and years about the improvements in their standards of living. But
the people actually see only small changes. The sweeping reforms
promised these citizens haven’t materialized. Increasing cultural
contact shows them how much lower their standard of living really
is compared to similarly advanced countries of the western world.

All of these problems point to eventual disaster if the Russian
government fails to act wiselyr At some point me Soviet citizenry,
like their Polish brethren, are going to scream ENOUGH! When this
happens the USSR will be forced to pay more attention to those
domestic problems it has ignored because of the arms race. History
demonstrates that a people may only be repressed for a limited
period before they reach the end of their rope and demand fairer
resource allocation.
