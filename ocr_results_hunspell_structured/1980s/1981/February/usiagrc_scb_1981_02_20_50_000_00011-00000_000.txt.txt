national students two years ago to 43
this year, according to Nicole l-lamon,
loreign student adViser, These 43
students come from 22 diilerent counr
tries in Europe, Asia, Latin America
and Africa, Hamon suggests that the in-
crease in ioreign students at American
schools may be caused by increased at-
[ordability of education in the United
States due to devaluation of the dollar,
political uproar in parts oi the world
resulting in the closing oi many univerr
Sitles and decrease in enrollment oi
American students in US, institutionsi

Admissions counselor Murray

stated that the increase at Grinnell has
”begun on its own." No recruiting oi

Laotian troupe performs dances

by Lorri Lohmann

Thirty-two members at Natasin Lao.
the National Dance Troupe oi Laos,
now live and dance in Des Moines,
Iowa Most of the performers came to
the United States tram rerugee camps
in Thailand, having fled their country
alter its Communist takeover in 1975
Actually it may not be that unusual a
place [or these Southeast Asians to find
themselves. Des Moines has a large
Laotian reiugee population and the
state may have me largest number or
Laotians per capita oi any in the United
States, according to Ted Solis of the
music department. Refugees are on
couraged to settle here by various state
programs such as Iowa shares.

Rebuilding What had been the
premier folk dance company oi Laos
was made even more difficult due to the
loss of all music and costumes in a fire
at the Thai reiugee camp, However, the
troupe has received a $24,900 grant
from the National Endowment for the
Arts to reorganize and now consists oi
16 dancers and lo musicians. They are
struggling not only to refine their art
but to adjust to a new culture, language

paying jobs. The troupe members are
not getting paid now ior what many did '
for a living in Laos.

They will periorm their classical
dance theater in South Lounge Saturr
day at 7 pm Laotian theater is [radir
tionally music/dance drama based on
religious and mythological themes. The
troupe periorms its own music on such
instruments as xylophones, gongs, the
pi phat, drums and mouth organs. The
culture oi Laos has been highly in-
fluenced by India so Indian overtones in
the music and dance may be evident.
The ilowing dance and music perfor~
mance oi Natasili Lao comes to campus
under the sponsorship oi international
Weekend and the music department.

Thomas
replaces

Chekov

Ellen Mease ot the theater depart-
ment has decided against directing Ann
ton Chekov's The Cherry Orchard in
Iavor oi Under Milkwood by Dylan
Thomas. She and the cast felt the
Chekov play was less suited tor the ac-
ting experience oi the cast memhers.
The Thomas play contains about 100
small character sketches so that
everyone who had auditioned for
Chekov now has the option oi periorm-
ing in it. Mease is excited about the
number oi studentsinterested iii perfor-
ming and says Milkwood will demand
"a lot oi imagination and energy.
