Stuart stresses‘creativity’ in job search

by Kim MacDonald

Temporary jobs: a commodity which
may be in big demand and short supply
this summer

Reagan's lreeze on hiring, his budget
cuts, the current state of the economy
and the possibility that students may be
scrambling harder for tuition money if
Reagan's proposed cuts on student
loans and aid to colleges go through,
are all factors which Could create a
bleak picture for job hunters this sums
mer.

Director of Career Services, Deb
Stuart, keeps close tabs on the current
market but she does not give the im-
pression that the situation is hopeless,
only that students may have to be
"more creative" and Work harder to
find a job. She has lound that students
are "expecting problems" in finding
Jobs and attributes this to the possibili-
ty that potential employers may be
waiting till the last minute to hire
employees for the summer,

Students should not be frightened by
recent national unemployment figures.
since, as Stuart explained, these iigures
are "deceptive“ and many other fac
tors are involved which are not
reflected in such a broad figure. Cers
tain regions will be affected both
positively and negatively by the
economy. Michigan, for example,
because of the heavy automobile in-
dustry, might have a higher unemployr
ment level than the national average
whereas in areas in which there are
defense industries, employment may
be booming. Other factors which affect
employment that stuart brought up are
levels of education, population shitting
and the tact that many jobs are becoms
mg obsolete,

"People won't be handing you jobs,“
said Stuart but she mentioned a few
areas that students might explore ior
job possibilities, She suggested
students look into secretarial work if

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have any skills "since some
businesses may be so desperate they
may take someone in the summer"
Students with exposure to computers at
Grinnell might try looking ior jobs as
computer programmers since that is a
booming field. She added that engineer-
ing and accounting are also big iields
but noted that most Grinnell students
have “no background" in these areas.

AS far as traditional summer resort
area hiring is concerned, Stuart said
she has read arguments on both sides,
some which say that people "are still
putting money in recreation" and
others which predict that rising
gasoline prices will be an "added
burden" on the vacationer who will pr0‘
bably stay closer to home. Stuart ad-
vised students to look for Jobs in fields
*where they can "address a need” by
looking at the changes in the economy

and exploring areas which are positive
ly aiiected by these changes.

Stuart and the Career Services Office
are able to offer advice and information
to student job hunters both through
workshops and counseling sessions,
The new Pioneer Referral Network is a
computerized survey of over 7,000
working alumni lrom 1940 to 1979 which
can proVide students with iniormation,
possible job contacts and possibly even
jobs in places across the country. The
service, which won't be rully opera
tional until next week, is designed in
part simply to help "students get
ideas." _

Students who need job leads or infors
mation on things like interviewing
techniques and tips on resume writing

McConnell leads seminar on computer service

by Richard Letchlnger

Computers and food may sound like
an unlikely combination to you but not
to Dave McConnell, For McConnell, the
computer is an important tool in run»
ning a successful Food SerVice
organization and that was the subject of
a seminar held last Thursday, April 2
through Saturday, April 4 at Michigan
State University

Led by McConnell and Joanne Snider,
a computer soltwear vendor, represens
tatives from 21 schools attended the
seminar entitled “introduction to Com-
puters tor the Prospective User with
Specilic Emphasis on Food Service Ap-
plication." The seminar was sponsored
by NACUFS, the National Association
of College and University Food Ser-
vices.

“Part ol the seminar was a reView at

what Grinnell does," McConnell said
"But a great deal of it dealt with learn-
ing to design programs and understan-
ding how to computerize "

As far as the student is concerned, the
extent of the use or the computer at
Grinnell is limited strictly to what Mc»
Connell termed “ID control " But com»
puters are utilized in a variety of other
ways to help McConnell run an ellieicnt
organization.

For example. McConnell has pro
grammed the computer to produce a
“bid-analySls” printout of every item
Food Service of Grinnell tFOGl purs
chases. The computer helps McConnell
determine which bid is the "best buy"
on each speciiic item, thus giving him
more free time to, as he put it, “be with
the students finding out lrom them

what they like."

McConnell stressed that the Com-
puter can be a big money saver to a
food service. He cited Michigan State
University as an example. “At MSU
they serve 90,000 meals a day. it the
computer can save a penny a meal,
that's 5000 a day and over a Zoorday
period that's a lot or money."

At Grinnell, the computer and FOG
have been working together only three
years and McConnell feels that the use
oi the computer has been a great ad
vantage to the successful running oi the
organization The point of the seminar,
McConnell said, “was to teach people
what to do (with the computer), how to
overcome their fear of mem and also
how not to become a slave to them."
