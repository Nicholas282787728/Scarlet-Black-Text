Francois Truffaut’s second ﬁlm,
shoot the Piano Player, is one at the
most interesting, exciting and original-

. films I have ever seen. It is both an
“hilarious parody of gangster tilms and
a purposeful exposition on involvement
'n life.
The film concerns a young pianist
amed Charlie Who has withdrawn
- ruin his career,‘and life, into the seclur
sion of his role as piano player in an
obscure Parisian bar. He meets a
woman who reconnects him with his
past and he is rather violently led back
’into the mainstream, The plot revolves
.. ,on several axes and it is difficult to pin
point any single theme; Truffaut
‘himseli maintained that it lacked any
-such “guildirig line." This gives the
film a disjointed effect, making it more
C3 set 01 remarkable images than a sim-
. pie discourse on a theme.
’ Truffaut keeps the audience on its
feet, away from any fixed patterns oi

reaction, by combining two genres that .

seemingly can't be combined, parody
and serious drama. The characters act
o unexpectedly and inappropriately
: and the gangsters either fulfill or

ridiculously break so many cliches that
we cant .help but_ take the drama
l lightheartedly Yet is it the use oii
parody and irony that ultimately makes
the drama so serious, {or it keeps us off
our'guard,‘leaving'us vulnerable to the:
dramatic ‘evenw ot the, story. The
overall effect has been called surreal. It
is this sense of ridiculous Hagedy or
dramatic comedy which brings the film
so close to real experience and which,
despite the amazingly hleak story, is
finally so affirming. — John Spackman

Rude Boy

This film deals with The Clash's
material from their first two excellent
albumsI “The Clash" and “Give 'Em
Enough Rope." The combination oi
candid interviews and exciting live con-
cert footage makes this much better
than the usual runﬂfrthermill rock
movie. If this doesn't provide you with
enough motivation to attend the tilm,
see it if only to count the number of
Mick Jones' missing front teeth and to
witness the brooding, soulsearching
and significant glances that collars-up
bassist Paul Simnnon throws to any
women in the crowd who are willing to
acknowledge them. — Peter Ruderman

Picnic?“ Hanging Rock

Picnic at Hanging Rock tells the true
story of a group of girls from a boarding
school who went on a picnic in 1900.
Three of the girls and one of their
teachers disappeared that st. Valen-
tine's Day at hanging rock. Several
days later one or the girls was found
alive but she couldn‘t remember what
had happened. The others were never
seen again. The film doesn't try to solve
the mystery. It sticks to what iew (acts
are known about the incident but direc-
tor Weir achieves a wonderfully eerie
texture for the film The many seem-
ingly insignificant coincidences
(several watches are reported to have
stopped at the same time, tor example)
give the film an almost occult quality.
This must be the best real unsolved
mystery of all time and the film is both
fascinating and so creepy it’s almost
repulsive, This is probably one of the
stranger tilms you’ll ever get the
chance to see and it's worth whatever it
takes to get to. — Tom Spackman
