From the outside

Feeling less crowded in Chicago

by Kathy Willhorte

(chrcago) 7 ”Mixed leelings:' Thats how a
member ol Crmnell's class pl '55 here
descrrbed her attrtude toward her alma
mater 25-years later.

As a more recent Clinnell grad, my own
leelrngs are ”muted" rndeed, A December
grad, l am now detached ltom ctrnnell's dat-
ly lrle but Grlnnell rs strll a blg part ot me
and the emotronal tre rs still strong

Two years ago, rl asked to explaln my ab
trtude toward Crlnnell, I would have ens
thusiastrcally expounded the wonders .ol thrs
spectal, small, lrberal-arts school rtt the corn-
helds, Foul months ago, however, I would
have encouraged only my worst enemtes to
attend Grrnnell

Now the drstance ol lour months and
300m rnrles has rrnproved my attitude
toward the college, but not enough trme has
yet passed to allow lond leelrngs about the
many posltrve aspects o! my Crinnell years
to overshadow the accompanyrng negative
aspects

I am strll sorting rt all out, and probably
will be for years, but by compartng and con-
trasting lite at Crime" and lrte out here in
"(he real world,“ I have gamed a greater
understandrng of what exactly happened to
me and what probably happened to most ol
us dunng our years or tnvolvement tn the
enrgrna called "The ctrnnell Expellence."

The sheer intensity ol Ctinnell College is
what we love about the place and is what
turns us rnto emotional wrecks; tt provrdes
us wrth the hrghest hrghs and the lowest
lows oi our lrves lt accounts tor the rnrxed
leelrngs so many alums have toward the ler
strlutrorl
, Thrs rntenslty is partly a result ol the lact
that at Crrnn‘ell, there are no responstbrlitres
but those that you choose to take on tor
yourselt and no resttarnts but those you
choose to put on yourselt You, as a (Irvin-
nellran, are lree to rndulge rn anythtng you
want to at any trrne that you want to do rt

ln "the real wotld” the natural restralnrs or
tune and drslance lmpose necessary Ilmllar
trons upon our aclloqs, at Crrnnell, however,
the physrcal proxtntrty ol everyone to
everyone else and to the campus tacrlrtres
elrmrnates such restrarnts

You can intake as much 0! any rntoxrcatrng
substance as you teel lrke whenever you
want to wrthout concern about salely traveh

mg a dlslance to gel home You can see
whomever you're currently obsessed wrth up
to 24 hours a day. Any comnutment to
study or go to class rs only to yoursell and rs
much more tlextble than an employed per»
son's cornrnrtrnent to be at work nrne hours
a day, lrve days a week. On the other hand.
rl spendtng trme alone rs your thrng, your
lack ol responsrbrlttres whrch torcc you to
have contact wrth the outsrde world allows

you to never see anyone ll you don’t want
to. Those obsessed by schoolwork can study
and study themselves lnto physrcal wrecks,
tor the moderatrng lorces or an establrshed
tohour week don't apply

We Cvlnnelllans are capable ol total rrr
dulgence rn whatever smkes our lancres. We
can, and do, lrve by the creed ol rnstant
gratrtrcatron whatever rt ts that we want, we
want a lot ol rt. and we want rt now And
thrs unnatural, stresslul way ol lrle comes to
seem normal

Don't get me wrong l’m not advocatrng
the rnstrtutron or curlews or bed checks, a
crackdown on campus drugs, or the closrng
ol the Pub (especially not the closrng or the
Pub) 7 tar lrom rt. Such rules are r. culous,
amhcral rrrtposrtrons whrch would create
more drthcultres than they could ever come
close to SDIVlng l am merely potntrng out
that we pay a once lot the absence ol those
burltnn restrrctrons that are rnherent to socre
ty. whlle necessary to marntatn the precrous
untoueness ot our school, thrs total rreedom
contributes to Crlnnell‘s atmosphere ol ten-
sron, anxrety. and hypersensttrvrty

ln short, the result or all thrs unlrmrted sell-

 

rndulgence rs a lot or neurotrc people who
probably have a less than realrstrc vrew or
the outsrde world e where runctronrng let
ourres a degree ol moderatron and respon
slbrlity toward, and satrrlrce tor, others,

Thus, as you head out rnto the real world,
you wrll at lrrst reel restrarned. You wrll be
annoyed at havrng to plan every rendezvous,
tar rn advance (no more dropprng by a
lrrend's dorm on the spur or the moment).
You wrll be rndrgnant at havrng to moderate
how much beer you drrnk so that you can
get home salely tno more stumblrng home
lrom partres at 4 am or passtng out on a
dorm lounges couch). You wrll be drsmayed
at seerng your honey once or twrtea week
rather than the reoursrte srx trmes a day
whlch even Crlnnell’s couples wrth “low-key
relallonshlps” rndulge rn.

Bul alter a whrle, I know you'll begrn to ap~
precrate the space — both the trme and the
drstance — between people whrch rs so
much greater ln the crowded crtres than rr rs
wrthrn the Crlrlnell College communrty
srtuated rn the open lrelds ol lowa. Thls
space has allowed me, and many other
grads. to develop more rndependence. a
more relaxed attitude, and more control
over darly ltte e a greater sense ol sell.
peace, and sanrty.

or course thrs transrtron lrom Crmnell’s lns
tensrty to Somety's relarrve normalcy rs a
tradeolr ar rtmes. l sorely mrss the spent
tanerty at those Wednesday nrght partres,
the challenge at lhellesealch paper due the
next day, the exhrlaratron at a good
classroom drscussron,

But I hope that you and, as l have, that
socretys restrrctrons oﬂel a new, more
realrstrc krnd or treedom, what at lrrst seems
ccnllnlng rs actually easrer to lrve wrth
