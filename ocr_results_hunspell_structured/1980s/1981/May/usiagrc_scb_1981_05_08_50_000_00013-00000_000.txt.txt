EdiToniAl limesponsibiliry?

Editorial irresponsibility always sad
dens me. ”Opinion columns” 7 like the
5&3'5 “Open Space" 7 are important
to campus publications; the iorceiully
articulated positions of the authors
often make lor the publication’s most
interesting reading

But when these columns contain “lac-
tual" information it is the editors'
responsibility to make sure that ﬁle
“facts" are accurate. Elliot Pollock's
recent column indicates that the 8&3
editors don't take the responsibility too
seriously.

Pollock 7 through misinlormatian
and incomplete presentation of facts —
paints an inaccurate and potentially
damaging picture ol the Cyclone staff,

Not that the yearbook staff is overly
concerned about Pollock's charges;
I’m sure that most readers will con»
sider the source. In fact, I’d like to
thank the many members oi the came
pus community who expressed their
continued support and confidence in the
Cyclone last. weekend. Nonetheless,
Pollock's comments do deserve an of
iicial — and briei 7 reply.

None of the photograph ideas were re
jected for lack oi space. The editor
(that's me). in consultation with the
stall, made a conscious decision as to
what should and would be covered in
the 1931 Cyclone. Our resources are
limited and we must put them to the
best use; we cannot cover everything
associated with Grinnell College, We
are doing the best job possible ol cover-
ing the year on campus. If someone
would like to donate $2,000 to the
Cyclone, we would do better. But as
our resources stand, we cannot cover
oiicampus groups (especially groups
of two).

So why not the picture of KDIC DJs?
In our coverage oi campus organiza-
tions we must rely on the management
stafis or officers to those organizations
to set up the photo times. Dave Buck oi
KDIC decided the station photo would
be of the Executive Board only; I guess
he too thought it would be rather difr
ficult to get anywhere near the station's
loo DJs together at once, Pollock pro
tested; l informed Buck that we could
take an additional photo 7 with his per-
mission. Buck informed Pollock that if
and only if Pollock would guarantee
anywhere near 100 percent oi the star
tion DJs being present, the photo could
be taken. I'm told that besides Pollock
only one person showed up for the
photo. (In his article he says he called
“every single DJ” about the photo;
there seems, however, to be some
disagreement about that.)

Not to say that the yearbook has been
totally efficient and blameless We

May l, l98l

should never have scheduled the photos
in the first place; sometimes the lines
oi communication bog down. We are
truly sorry ior any inconvenience we
have caused. (In regard to the schedulr
ing there is an interesting anecdote that
Pollock left out of his piece: when Copy
Editor Mike Alexander expressed

doubt about being able to arrange the ,

photo, Pollock exploded, ”I want you to
know that I’m a close personal friend of
Dan Flynn." You wouldn't be able to
tell it irom his column, would you7l
But all of this is secondary to this col
umn: the real question here is why is
there need for response? when the 5&8
heard about charges against a campus
organization, the editors should have
assigned a reporter to investigate those
charges. After the publication oi the
column, Editor Anne Rawland told me
mat she didn’t believe the charges
herself, She said that in deciding to run
the piece she considered various lac-

l

DAN Flynn

tors and concluded that ultimately the
column would do the yearbook more
good than harm.

I'm sure she was right The
yearbook’s reputation has suffered no
harm; the 5613’s, however, has, Truth
— not eventual outcome _ should be
the standard by which articles are con-
sidercd.

Elliot Pollock, like everyone else had
the right to his own opinion He doesn t
like the style oi our yearbook' some
don t like the style of his radio show:
style is open to debate

Truth is not. Pollock does not have
the right to create his own i'acLs And
the SdtB cannot disclaim its liability for
libelous misinformation printed on its
pages.

To retain its credibility the publica»
tion has certain responsibilities. Good
intensions cannot restore damaged
credibility, i sincerely hope the editors
realize this in the future.
