Keenlng the hall rolllnu

This week-Grinnellians finally get their chance to painlessly con-
tribute to not one but two public issues related to our nation’s posture
in the outside world. Just as during the 19605, students on campus
are organizing fund-raisers and filing petitions, only this time the
issues concern El Salvador andSouth Africa,

 

Tomorrow evening 51 gets you hours of entertainment donated by
several campus bands and all the beer you can drink. In addition
your money goes to support a growing awareness on this campus
that we can, and must, use our weight as a relatively financially
secure institution to make a statement about our brothers and
sisters in South Africa.

The dedicated students sponsoring this event plan to use the
monies they collect to get their message out on campus as well as to
educate the trustees. They are taking the initiative and all we must
do is party!

Also, one week from today, El Salvador will he the center of atten-
tion for the Annual FOG Fast. For each student who abstains from
the dining hall cuisine, Dave McConnell promises to send direct
monetary aid to El Salvador.

Although this gesture may hurt your pallet more than the
aforementioned dance (depending of course on how much beer you
drink), you’ll be making a small sacrifice to help the Salvadorans
help themselves, Besides, many of us go out to eat once a week
anyway, so why not put your FOG dollars to good use'.7

Understandably, as finals time draws near and spring fever hits
with full force, we all tend to forget about matters outside of our cozy
rural campus. So why not keep the ball rolling by lending a hand to
those more energetic? Remember — you may not reap the rewards
now but there is life after Grinnell.
