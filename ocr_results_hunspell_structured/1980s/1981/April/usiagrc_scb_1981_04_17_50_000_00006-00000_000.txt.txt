Credit and the debut of Margaret Thatr
cher and the Supply Side. Each band
will play for approximately onehall
hour, beginning with the Acapulcos
playing some acapella tunes.

The South Atrican Support Group was
organized by Joel Robbins, Rob
Schwartz and Routenda Mantiziba, an
African student, after the idea for a
group came up in a DSOC meeting last
semester. They later discussed aparr
theid with Dumusani Kumalo, a black
South African journalist in exile, who
visited the Grinnell campus in
September. At last February‘s trustee
meeting they spoke with the board
members, who agreed to a full board

G.L.A.R.E. holds
Bur/ing Library

by Ellen Heath

Organized in the past two weeks. the
Grinnell Liberation Army for Revolur
tionizing Education (CLARE) has
begun what members describe as "a
triendly reign oi terror "

The organization representatives
said, “The real reason (for our ac-
tivities) is that Grinnell College is get
ting extremely boring." Last Wednese
day night, G.L.A.R.E. started its terr
rorist movement with attacks on Burlr
ing Library and the Forum Elaborate
plans were made for the library take
over The group met in the basement
storage rooms and then split to run up
the staircases throwing out lists of their
demands and tiring squirt and pellet
guns. One member said they laced no
opposition as Associate Librarian
Steven Pandolfo sat quietly in his chair
throughout the coup.

G,L A.R.E. raided the Forum grill
next and had noticeable effect on
studenB there. The terrorists said some
students “perked up,” some “sat in
bewilderment" and some "were
pissed.“

Unless its demands are met,
G.L.A.R E. intends to continue these
occurrences on a weekly basis These
demands range irom landing a hijack~
ed DC9 on Route 6 to release of the
prisoners in the classes of Ira Strauber.
Cliff Reid, Rogers Gurii'a and Ed Dom-
browski toa request that the campus be
moved to Tenaily. NJ.

The group has about 18 members
which, it points out, is two percent of
the student population at A.R.E, also
denies any involvement with the toilet
paper thefts

meeting with lour oi the Students on
May I to discuss divestment.

The group is concerned about Grin-
nell's involvement in the apartheid
government in South Africa through its
investments and the $1 admission
charged lor the party will be used to ac»
quire materials to further educate the
student body at Grinnell about the
South African Sltuatlon. The group will
iniorm the campus speciﬁcally about
Grinnell’s economic involvement in
South Africa and about the movement
for divestment. According to Robbins,
the group has no speciiic dollar figure
they wish to attain but urges everyone
to attend for the cause

At present, a table is set up every
Thursday and Friday in North Lounge
with information about South Africa
and petitions promoting Grinnell's
divestment. Information is also
available there on the Sullivan Prmr
ciples of moral behavior, which Com-
panies are supposed to abide by in their

group ‘

operations The principles are supposed
to be effective in reducing racism,
however, the group {eels that they are
ineffective.

How do the bands which are playing
leel about the upcoming event? Said
The Johns» "Although we’re doing this
because we enjoy playing, we all
believe that the gravely serious matter
is a good cause." The band members as
well as others concerned about the
South African situation are angry about
the defacement of the "Rock Against
Repression" posters upon which so-
meone has scratched Out the words
"Rock Against" leaving only the word
"Repression."

Another member of both the In
dustrial Agents and Pop ior Credit said
he "plays lor iun in the firstplace" and
"doesn’t know that much about it [the
South African situation!" but thinks it's
a good Cause. Both Robbins and

Schwartz believe it will be a "revolu»
tionary event."
