McConnell sa

by Julie Shefsky

Every person in the dorms will get
two bagels at a midnight finals bagel
break sponsored by Food of Grinnell
tFOGl in support of Mark Liberson's
busmess. Bagels Ltd.

This bagel break. which will replace
one of FOG'S usual finals study breaks,
ls one way Dave McConnell wishes to
apologize to Liberson "for any remarks
. that were construed to be negative
in nature " since Liberson established
his business on campus Liberson said
that when, ”people started telling me
that Dave McConnell said that I'm go-
ing to be put out of business" the cons
flict began. But "everybody told me
you can't fight with Dave McConnell"
so "I took refuge," he said. But his
main complaint was that McConnell
was “gossiping" about a student. "As
an administrator he should realize it‘s
his reponsibility to be careful what he's
talking about," he said.

Liberson's next example of McCon-
nell trying to put him out of business
was the second week of bagel distribu
tion in the fall. According to Liberson,

. McConnell approached him and warned
~l|lm in a threatening manner that he'd
better get in touch with the Iowa
Agriculture Department because he
could be violating health coda and
would be fined. ”To me, it sounded like
a threat that I was in trouble and these
people were coming," said Liberson,
But McConnell said that he gives the
same advice to all students who start a
campus food business. “I'm here to
facilitate the students‘ businesses," he
said.

As a ”broker" of bagels, Liberson
doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the
state Agriculture Department's lood
protection laws. Bob Haxton. Licensing
Division supervisor, said that because
Bagels Ltd, is not a business establish-

To: Members of the Campus Community

I take this forum to apologize directly to Mark Liberson for any
remarks said in the Pub and at any Rugby gathering that were con-
strued to be negative in nature and further interpreted as an effort to
put him out of business. This has never been my intent; and, I am
sincerely sorry if that has been the impression left with members of

the campus community.

In a strong show of support of Mark‘s enterprise, I will
wholeheartedly assist in making the dorm Bagel Breakfasts become
a campus Wide success during the coming weeks and into the next
year. I also take full responsib ty for the inconvenience to Langan
and Norris Halls and their particular Bagel Breakfasts. Mark was in
no way at fault with the arrangements made.

In closing to show support for Mark, the Food Service will be spon»
spring a Midnight Bagel Break for finals week for each dorm. We
will provide 2 bagels, cream cheese, etc, for all dorm residents.
Again, hopefully this gesture will place behind us any bad feelings

over this matter.

Sincerely.

ment where food is being prepared or
stored it doesn't need to be inspected
and licensed,

”As Hie novelty of our item were off,"
said Liberson, ”it was time to find other
ways to increase orders.” Thus. bagel
breakfasts for whole dorms were
started, A dorm submits a list of in
terested students and their 1D numbers
to Liberson and he then gives the list to
FOG. Those students skip their regular
breaktast one weekend morning and on
Sunday Bagels Ltd. serves them two
bagels per person plus additional food
from Cowles. FOG was to supply the
dorm with six ounces of orange juice,
onerhalf pint of milk, one ounce of
cream cheese and a pad of jelly for
each person, according to Liberson, He”
claimed to have conflicts with McCon-
nell because he thought the FOG direc
tor retused to supply the lood.

Liberson also felt that McConnell
thought there was unlair competition
with the Forum grill. McConnell
disagreed and said, “Our clientele is
different." Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman said he couldn‘t understand
why McConnell could possibly reel
threatened, especially financially.

Liberson complained to President
George Drake and Tederman after a
few instances where McConnell
hesitated to supply the food for dorm
bagel breakfasts. He then confronted
McConnell and they discussed and
resolved Liberson's grievances.

Faculty passes
”F” grade

Although several faculty members
argued that “punishment is not an ap~
propriate part of eduction . .and the 1"
grade is punishment," the proposal to
reinstitute the ”F” passed its final
reading 50-29 at Monday’s faculty
meeting. The grade will not be
reinstituted until the 1982433 academic
year,

oblong with the “F",grade the faculty
adopted new drop deadlines. For those
students who drop courses during the
first three weeks of classes, no entry
will appear on their transcripts.
However, on the transcripts of those
students who drop classes during the
fourth through ninth weeks the symbol
WP or W!“ will appear. The marks
stand for “withdrawal while passing"
and “withdrawal while failing,"
respectively.

In a move to improve the computa—
tion of G.P.A.s, the faculty approved
the motion which allows use of only the
