College requires more fire prevention

by Marilyn Clark

Are there buildings or dorms at Grin-
neil College which do not comply with
modern saiety standards? According to
Kathleen Lamb and Pamela Schatzer,
tWo inspectors irorn uie State Fire Mar-
shall's Oliice who visited the campus
during the month oi January, the
answer is yes

The last state iire inspection at Grins
nell occurred 15 years ago, in 1966.
Since that time advancements in tire
saiety have resulted in reappraisais oi
areas formerly thought to be within iire
saiety standards Thus, at Grinnell
many of the Fire Marshall's recom-
mendations are for installation of early
smoke detection systems and numerous
minor safety features to prevent tires
from occurring.

The report, which is approximately
82-pages long, is an up-to-date evalua-
tion of all buildings on campus and oli-
campus housing. According to Presi-
dent George Drake, "The college plans
to respond to the Fire Marshall’s report
in a two-stage process First, we have
verbally agreed to legally meet the
standards. We Will then be negotiating
a written agreement on what will ac~
tually be done on campus."

At the present time, a process at
negotiation is taking place because
there are different solutions togrectiiyr
ing a fire safety problem. Yet, accor»
ding to Waldo Walker, executive vice»
president oi the college and the person
in charge oi heading the process of
compliance, “All citations Will be met
in some form whether it is the exact
recommendation of the Fire Marshall's
Office or a compromise reached bet-
ween the college and the state . »

Walker and Drake Stated, “0i all
schools in Iowa. Grinnell College is in
better than average condition. We are
in the top 25 percent range in terms oi
quality tire protection Moreover, Boot)
percent of all citations are for small

’ items and nothing is very serious. In a
short time, soon percent at the citations
will easily comply with regulation."

Drake emphasized that the cost oi
compliance will be expensive but that
assets are available, lie said, "An at»
tempt to minimize the costs whenever
possible will be made but safety will not
be sacrificed," Drake also stated, “The
number of fire citations is not due to the
college's lallure to maintain saiety
standards but that changing
technological standards have brought
greater awareness of potential hazards
in areas previously classified as
'sai'e.’ "

Although negotiations are still being
worked out and a final report by the Col
lege on what will be done will not be
completed until August or September, a
priority list has been tentatively com»

Anni l7, l 98l

piled that states the order in which the
college Will begin Work on the areas
cited, The Buildings and Grounds staff
will be working on three areas of cone
cern this summer. in this way the col
lege hopes to avoid hiring outside
workers

The first priority, according to
Walker, is the oil-campus housmg, One
example oi what the Fire Marshall‘s
report on oiicanipus houses stated can
be seen in exerpts irom the report of
citations for 1008 Park Street:

ll This building does not meet cons
structlon regulations tor use as a dorm,

2) Provide an approved second
emergency exit tor the second iioor.

37 Provide a one-hour fire rated
separation between iirst and second
floors and between the base and Iirst
floor.

4)The main entrance and exit must
be hung to swing out with direction at
exit travel.

5! home emergency lighting in extt
ways,

6) All carpeting in exit ways must be
class ”A"/Ilame spread rating 0! «>25.

71 Provide an approved tire alarm
system in this building to include a
manual pull start on each ﬂoor. Extend
this system to include automatic smoke
detectors in the stairwell,

8) Provide and mount a iive~pound
ABC type tire extinguisher on every
floor and one in the basement.

According to Walker, who was reluc-
tant to give the 8&8 access to the Mai”

shall‘s report, item 1 does not mean
that the oiicampus houses are unsafe
in terms of lire protection. Rather the
buildings' classification as dorms_is in
appropriate, as the houses are wood»
framed structures, not brick and not as
many students live in houses as in
dorms. Thus, the college is attempting
to have them reciassiiied as “boarding
housertypewstructures, which will then
meet state lire standards.

(In Item 2 Walker explained, “Second
floor escape exits Will be built over the
summer on the oiicampus houses in
order that a quick exit may be made in
the event at fire. The off-campus houses
will eventually be worked on so that all
the Citations are corrected in some
way."

Drake stated, "After renovation ol
the dorms is completed in two to three
years, the college will not need the
houses for students and they will be
converted possibly into faculty
housing.”

The second priority area will be the
installation of smoke and fire detectors
in dorms and collegerowned buildings.
Presently, the "Rate of Rise" model is
used by the college. Renovated dorms
such as Read already have these deteo
tors,

The third area to be worked on by B 5:
G is storage area clearance, These
areas will be reorganized over the sum»
mer, items such as bicycles, trash,
boxes, etc., will be removed irom the
exit corridors.
