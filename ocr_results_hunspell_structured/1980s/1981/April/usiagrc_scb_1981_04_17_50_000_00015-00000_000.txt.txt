Does SGA represent student interest?

 

T0 the Editor:

The recent SGA elections reveal what
appears to be a continuing fact of stu»
dent government at Grinnell. namely,
that there are no issues. The posters of
the various Candidates emphasized
such things as experience, ad-
ministrative competence and a will-
ingness to listen to student concerns.
This last category is particularly in
teresting since the candidates seem to
limit the range of student concerns ex-
cluding the bum policy decisions of the
college.

For the candidates SGA is a service
organization at best; matters of cur~
riculum and administrative policy be»
ing secondary amusements. This, it
seems to us. is an incredibly trivial
view D! SGA functions that. in tact,
denies the implication of the title Stu-
dent Government Association. What the
candidates advocated was not a governs
merit at all but rather an elaborate
system to disperse student funds. While
this is a necessary iunction, there is no
reason why it should be the only one. his
deed. it seems to us that this should be a

Goddard's opinion strikes some sour notes }

To the Editor:

Pam Goddard suggested in her artir
cle last week mat Grinnell College in-
crease iLs enrollment substantially ,to
encourage campus diversity and town
growth. Yet, to alter the size at the cam-
pus and town community would be to
undermine the very uniqueness or Grin-
nell College.

The concept oi “scale': helps to
demonstrate the difference between the
community round in a small town (or
college) and the variety of communities
existing in the urban enVlronment tor
large university). "Scale" is used to
mean the maximal size oi the social.
political, economic and ideological
communication networks which
signiiicantly involve and affect the
members of a social entity,

Though communities eXist in urban
areas as well as small towns. the
change in “scale" alters the type of in-
teraction that ensues. The interaction
on this campus takes account of both
person and status. The environment
that is created by Grinnell College and
its surroundings is personal, The per-
sonal community is congruent with the
total communit this helps to make the
“Grinnell experience" uniquer

My respect for this college stems
from my growing awareness that
academically and socially this.college
provides an extensive array of diverse
modes to express oneself. if Grinnell

teraction would tend to be role specific

government; the primary function be
ing the formulation of student positions
on basic policy decisions. These are
decisions that are essential to the
educational process, thus, being of vital
importance to any organization purporr
ting to represent student interests.

The system as it presently stands
puts the student in essentially the same
position as an industrial worker.
Students at Grinnell are seen as having
both a job to peiorm and no real
business in determining the process oi
their own labor, Yet the student, unlike
the worker, is not a means to an end;
he/she is the end. Education centers
around the mind oi the student not on
any external product, Thus, it is ironic
that students, who along with the facul-
ty form the essence of the educational
process, are only a peripheral voice in
the decisionemaking process.

of forums [or student involvement;

challenge of Grinnell, the rewards are
enormous. However, if you are unhaps

dissatisfaction and discover your niche
elsewhere. i am not advocating "Love
it or leave it " but rather know yourself
and your needs and have the conviction
and courage to follow their dictates. 7

Oh boy, here it is again. More
bellyaching about Grinnell’s inability to
entertain the students of Grinnell Col,
lege. Somebody wants a shopping mall,
more students and a real rock ’n' roll
band to make life in Grin City more
bearable. This swell little town is sup-
posed to change its entire character
just because there are some
dissatisfied students at the college.

Forget it, you're only here for four
years and those of us who plan to hang
around tor a while are pretty loud at the

, place, We need a shopping center like a

turtle needs a briefcase. Why would we
want Grinnell to become like every
other town in America?

Small town America has every right
to continue, If you want a bigger town.

those of us who like the small
town/small college way of life as card
carrying dunderheads is more oi a
reﬂection on the damn-er than on the
damned in this case.

I am really sad to hear that Grinnell

why is this forum not utilized? 'The

in the attitude at those involved in sch.

Now there will be those who will

concerning the college's investment in
corporations that deal in South Africa

No humor here

To the Editor:

It has come to my attention lately
that a very sinister aspect of the Grin»
nell College community has been
emerging. So far this semester, I and
numerous other students have received
in our mailboxes several pieces of cor-
respondence, the sole purpose or which
has been to deiame a fellow studentts).
True, 1 may not share the common con-
cept at what is and isn't humorous here
at Grinnell. Nonetheless, I feel it
necessary to remind my fun-loving
peers that the use (or rather abuset ’oi
the school postal system as a way to
pull 0“ a practical joke or, more imporr
tantly. to vent a personal vendetta’,-is
not only wrong (and perhaps illegal)
but bespeaks of something far worse: a
very real lack oi respect and consider»
tion for those whose Style of lite and
thinking are diiferent from what we
wish to agree with. 7 sincerely. Ruth
