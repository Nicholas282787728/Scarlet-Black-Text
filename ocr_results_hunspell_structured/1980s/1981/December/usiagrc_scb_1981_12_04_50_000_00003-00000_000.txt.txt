Joint Board sets

investment guidelines
Loan program made official

by Marty Merlotto

On Dec. 2, the Joint Board of the SGA
passed two resolutions into by-laws of the
SGA Constitution. The first hyrlaw cons
cerned new guidelines for Joint Board in
vestments, and the second one established
a new shortrterm loan program.

The investment resolution called [or the
SGA auditor to recommend investment op-
tions to the Joint Board, based on decisions
made by the SGA Treasurer and by the
Finance Committee. The ﬁnance Corns
mittee has the prerogative to make invest-
ment decisions but the Joint Board
reserves the right to overrule any action
According to SGA Auditor Leighton
Nakaia, this bylaw was established so
that any decisions made by the auditor can
be backed up by other members of the SGA
responsible for finances. “The Joint Board
can now be sure that any new financtal
decisions are not the arbitrary opinion or

' the auditor,” said Nakata,

Another reason for the change was
presented by Mark Salmanson, chairman
of the Student Rules committee. Accor»
ding to Salmanson, one of the reasons tor
the change was to make sure that the SGA

treasurer. a representative of the campus
community, and not the college treasurer
would decide what to do with SGA funds.
This view was supported by SGA
Treasurer John Moffet who said, “it is the
responsibility of the SGA to decide how its
iunds are spent." This resolution was passr
ed by a unanimous vote, with one abstenr
tion.

The shortrterm student loan program
resolution called for the establishment of a
loan program to help provide students with
an emergency iuiid in the case of
monetary crisis The resolution creates a
fund that allows a student to borrow up to
$50 for a maximum of 30 days. A student
can apply tor a loan alter a waiver form
has been signed and witnessed by the stu-
dent coordinator and an SGA cabinet
member. This resolution was also passed
unanimously.

The investment decision by-law Should
be in effect by the next SGA Joint Board
meeting, The short-term loan program has
already been set up and students can apply
for such loans at the SGA office, located on
south campus,

than they saw last year and that the “load
has been made considerably lighter" since
the arrival of Gallagher.

The Health Center start is currently cone
sidering, adding services such as strep
throat cultures to the services they
already perform, however, Griswold has
not yet decided when or it this will be done.
She feels that “more research needs to be
done as to the cost factor and student in-
terest" beiore reaching a decision.
Griswold also stated that the dectsion is
not entirely hers to make; she plans on
speaking with the doctors in town, Dean at
Student Attairs vicerresident Jim Teder-
man and Executive President Waldo
Walker

Sub-committee to

examine S.A. program

Group wants to ensure continued
success of program

by Jeff Raymond

A meeting oi the Committee on Student
Life was held shortly after fall break and it
was decided then that a subcommittee
should be formed to look into the role of the
Student Advisors at Grinnell College. This
decision by the CSL was not prompted by
an immediate desire or need ior change
but came from the observation that the
S.A. program as a whole has not been ex
amined in any detail for .a number oi
years.

The sub-committee will spend all of next
semester evaluating the program and will
assemble a report on their findings. Head
ed by Associate Dean oi Student Affairs
Flossie Mitchell, the subcommittee will
consist of two faculty members, two R,A.s,
two S As and two other students. Although
Mitchell is trying to choose members of
the group by the end ol the semester, the
list is still tentative and incomplete.

Mitchell stressed that there is no real

dissatisiaction with the 5.». program as it
now stands and she can‘t guarantee that
changes will be made. She noted that even
though the S.A. program is an on-going af-
fair, there has not been a recent evaluation
to make sure that the program is upto»
date and operating with the best results.
This is not consistent with thegrest of the
school in that other departments at the col-
lege undergo regular periods or selfr
evaluation and examination, Since the
reviewing committee has not yet been
chosen, Mitchell doesn't know the direc-
tion Hie probe will take nor what goals the
committee will Set.

This investigation has nothing to do With
the S A. evaluations that were completed
by students after fall break Those evaluaa
tions were for the S.A.s‘ personal
rererence whereas this upcoming evalua-
tion will tocus on the s A. program as a
whole,

New status conferred on Grinnell House

A quirk in state and federal fire regula
tions means Grinnell House is not a “Class
B” hotel and, consequently, itfalls into the
“Guest House" category and cannot
charge its guests for accommodations.

According to Executive VicerPresident
Wally Walker, the new policy was eiiected
last June after the State Fire Marshall's
Office informed the college that Grinnell
l-louse did not meet the saiety regulations
ofa “Class B” hotel. “It's one of those silly
regulations where the semantics you use to
describe a place determines its class,"
said Walker.

Prospective students, parents of present
students and special guests of the college
are still housed in the building and most of
them contribute a donation instead oi pay~
ing the required tee. “We used to charge
guests about one third of what it costs to
stay downtown said Doris l-lartley,
supervisor or Grinnell House Walker
reported that donations are running nearly
even with the amount gained when

roomers were charged.

A renovation of Grinnell House is on the
administration's agenda for the next one to
two years, although the Board oi Trustees
has not been presented with an otiicial pro
posal, The project, which could cost from
$225,000 to £250,000, would include the addi- ‘
tion of a steel fire escape to the back of the
building, The plumbing and wiring
systems would be completely overhauled
and walls would then need repair after be»
mg torn up for those improvemean, The
kitchen would also be remodeled and
sprinklers might be installed in this area.

The college's recent purchase of Wind
sor House at 1026 Park St. (formerly "the
pink house") is also serving as extra hous-
ing for guests when Grinnell House is
crowded The main iunction of Windsor
House, however, is to house visiting
dignitaries, job applicants and internar
tional students who cannot go home dul'r
ing breaks
