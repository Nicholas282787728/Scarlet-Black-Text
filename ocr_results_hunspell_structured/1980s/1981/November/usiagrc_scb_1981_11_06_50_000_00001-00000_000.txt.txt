Carl “as horn in the Soutlivlest Iowa
ton-n oi Atlantic Although her parents
were Republicans. she became a
Democrat in the late 19605. For the past 10
years she has worked in higher education.
Carl does not icel her experience in higher
education or her three and one-half years
at Grinnell directly ailected her decision
to run for political office. "I just decided to
run one day . . but rm not sure exactly
why." she said. Yet in the election Carl
was associated with the college because
she received support irom many college
students and her opponent was Gregg Ed-
leards, a 1980 graduate of Grinnell.

During the 1989 election many
Republicans were elected across Iowa
But in terms at the state legislature.
.Poweshiek County stayed iairly
democratic, The legislative district which
includes Grinne!l has been represented by
Democrats tor the past 10 years but this
constancy is not, characteristic oi county
politics in general. Rather Grinnell and
Poweshiek County‘s voting pattern is ex-
tremely volatile. In 1972. three at the [our
precincts in Grinnell supported George
McGovern while in 1930 the county went
ior Ronald Reagan over President Jimmy
Carter by a vote of 4.595 to 3.525. Thus over
the years the political balance has shifted
back and forth between the Republicans
and Democrats In addition people in Grins
nell do not vote strictly by party line,
"Grinnell is more independent in its voting
stance." said John Breemer. News Editor
of The Grinncll Herald-Register.

Carl characterized the present political
affiliations 0t voters as anesthlrd
Democratic. onerthird Republican and
Olle'thll‘d independent "Most of the cola
lege and town people who voted ior me,"
slit: said. “were, however. more liberal
tha people iroiri the other areas in the
district ”

C' 1s election was the result of unusual
politlcul maneuvers In 1980 Joan Orr
tD-Grinnelll decided not to run for state
senator in the 36th District. Hci vacant
seat was sought by 7lst District n prescn
[alive Emil. Husak tD’FUledol ' left
the 71st District House seat vacant.

Carl initially entered the Democratic
primary tor this seat as a writerln cane
didale. Although Mary hartnctt, a limo
Grinncll graduate, won the primary. she-
later withdrew her nomination. Thus, a
special election was held between Carl and
Gordon Early. the candidate Hartnett had
originally deieated. Carl won this primary
and went on to tlelcat Republican Gregg
Edwards by a vote of 3.135 to 2.133 in the
county. "Districtrwide. Carl captured the

House seat by a vote or 6,662 to Edwards
4.613. The 7lst District includes portions of
Poweshiek, Tama, Benton and lowa coun-
ties.“ reported the llcrhldvltegistt‘t‘ on
Nov, 6, 1580.

Reflecting about the campaign Carl
said, "The last election wasgood, Many
college students worked for me and there
was a good turn-out in the county because
it was an election year. The doorknocking,
asking ier money and canvasing were a

‘ positive experience."

The 69th Assembly. which Carl was part
oi, met ior five months last year from
January to May During the time the
legislature was in session Carl lived in Des
Moines, although she maintains her perr
manent home in Grinneil. Because oi her
interests Carl is on the Energy, Education,
Human Resources and the Social Services
Appropriations Committee, Every bill in

the legislature must go to a standing com~ .

mittee and one appropriations committee.
Carl noted that the ma]or issue belore
[lie 6th Assembly was reapportionment.

which will directly affect the political '

make-up oi the state Three plans were
presented before the legislature helore a
bill was passed. "The iirst plan oi the
regular session," Carl said. "was a line

representation. But because Fl l District

District Congressman Tom Tauke. two III'

same district. the Republican leade '

Republicans against it.‘ she added.

"Th econd proposal which again met the

said Finally in August at the second

Carl went on to stress that she does not
receive enough feedback ll'Dm voters
about their interests or about their reaci
lions to the bills passed in the‘lasl
assembly.iMany interest groups. however,
are in contact with Carl "I hear from
teachers, the Farm Bureaus. the League
of Women Voters. the UAW and other
unions, But the many diiierent interests in
the county , the college students and the
[armers A» does not make Grinnell a
speciiiealty unique town in iowa because
there are other areas which have consli»
tuencies like this town. she said

Although Carl does liol have lurthel
political aspirations beyond seeking
reelection next year. she is not sure
whether she will ever reenter higher-
education "Right now I have decided to
run again because it is so complex to learn
about the history oi the state and how to
work with various political interests and
groups in state politics, it takes more than
two years i will he better able to serve this
district as 1 gain more experience in
oltlcc.“ Carl concluded
