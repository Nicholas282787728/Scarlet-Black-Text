A different kind of tour

when asked for their tirst impres»
sions or Grinnell (for Go magazine),
many people says something on the
order or “friendly, smiling people,"
“everyone says hello to you" or “Iamlr
ly atmosphere,” And, in tact, during
New Student Days. everyone seemed
amiable, helptul and ready to get to
know you. Soon thereafter, however,
one notices a change in climate.

Now, I'm not talking about roommate
squabbles or even floor battles for those
are natural when totally dirterent pear
ple live together in close quarters. Even
little {actions on ﬂoors are difficult to
avoid, if only the sleepers vs. the
rowdies or the druggies vs, the
straights. But this year saw some ma
jor schisms complete with hatred,
spite and threats, Early in the year, the
athlete debate [orced us to identify
ourselves with the “dumb jocks" or the
“pseudorsixties whining whimps." We

/

tought it out constantly 7 in the dining
halls, on the walls, at open Iorums and
in the newspaper (I recall one issue at
the 55:3 that held little else but pros and
antirathlete propaganda.) I began to
tear civil war until the student body ap-
parently talked memselves out and
went on to new battles.

Although athletic battles died a quiet
death, other battles continue on another
tront. Burling Library bathrooms are
as tamous tor their grattiti as Grinnell
is tor its iriendly people. Theoretically,
grartiti serves as a way to make une’s
opinions, proround thoughts and clever
quips known to the world, It should be
run, interesting and occasionally
enlightening to read walls crammed
with various scrawls, However, the

women’s bathroom in Burling is
disgusting It has become a forum for
cattiness, stupidity, trash and personal
vendettas. Some of us have taken to hik-

An Open Letter to the College Community:

Looking back on my four years at Grinnell, I approach com-
mencement with mixed emotions On one hand, Ifeel sorry to
leave my environment, my friends, my academic pursuits, and
my extracurricular activities. On the other hand, I can hardly
contain my feelings of happiness and accomplishment in
reaching the conclusion of my undergraduate education and the
accompanying venture into_the “real world.”

To those of my friends still engaged in the “Grinnell Ex-
perience,” I sincerely hope that you will make your time here
as enjoyable and productive as I have and to my fellow
classmates I offer best wishes for success in future endeavors
— nearly every important achievement in this world has bene
done by people who refuse to give up.

mg over to the Forum rather than being
sickened by the bathroom walls in the
library.

Allow me to take you on a tour of the
women‘s bathroom. The stalls (end
two) are the territory oi the Iemimsts
and lesbians. Here are addressed topics
such as sexuality, Ieminism, equal
rights, love, masturbation and orgasm.
Most oi it isn't profound but it is
basically inoIlensive and it makes for a
pleasant study break or two.

Once you emerge trom the stalls,
however, the graifiti degenerates.
There Is very little written on the rest oi
the walls that is not incorporated into
some kind of list or other. Those that
are supposed to be harmless such as
“Ten best-looking guys on campus"
and “People it always makes you hair
py ,to see" would be fine it they were
just filled in with names, But for almost
every name there are comments about
the objectionahility oi the person. Ila
woman thinks that “best-looking guy"
ts is a jerk or minus a personality, she
must publicize this opinion next to h|S
name.

Then there are the lists that would be
kind of cute it they weren't taken so
seriously ‘ or so malicmusly. For-
tunately, women reIused to incriminate
specific men on the list of “Infamous
one-liners (and source)" and that list
can be funny to read. Others, however,
such as “People who must have been
abused as children" and “People who
want their names on lists" are a
playground for pent-up animosities.
(Grrr. . let’s scratch each other's eyes
out!) Commenting upon the inanity oi
such lists, I began a list of “Ten
people." By the next time I was down
there, someone had scratched a name
off the list (not a person?) and angrily
scrawled next to it “What Is the mean-
ing at this list'l" 7 as if the others
meant something?!

So people are using potentially
harmless lists as weapons. This was the
tirst stage, But Grinnell women have
graduated to premeditated venting oi
hostility. There is a list of "Ten biggest
jerks" which encourages the publicize
mg or hatred. And last time I was in the
bathroom, I discovered a new one:
“People you really hate to have in a
class.” I wanted to (angrily) scrawl
"What is the meaning of this list?" but I
didn't have a pen, Now Ido. What is the
meaning at it? What is the point or it'!
What good could it possibly do? Why do
women allow it to be there? And why do
they put names on it? Most important-
ly, what is happening to Grinnell's
“friendly people" and "family at
mosphere‘“? '

Scarlet and Black,
