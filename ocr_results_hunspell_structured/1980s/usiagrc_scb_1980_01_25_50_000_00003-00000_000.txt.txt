A look ahead...and back

Much to everyone’s surprise, the Iowa Caucuses sent a ring
ing message across the country that politics is alive and well
after a decade of apathy As guest columnist Barry Litt points
out, the “structureless” 70’s may be replaced by a new search
for order in the 80’s The turnout in the caucuses is a signal in
the political arena that the search in underway.

' In a similar reﬂective vein, Projects editor Renae Reese has
C@Fﬂ@ﬁ @ @ﬂ@@l}§ worked up a photojournalistic rememberance of the Grinnell of
the 70’s. You will see how much has changed in just ten years,
We hope you continue to find the S&B provacative, Let us
know what you are thinking; drop us a line. And everybody
“WW" ""‘°’ pray for an early spring.
