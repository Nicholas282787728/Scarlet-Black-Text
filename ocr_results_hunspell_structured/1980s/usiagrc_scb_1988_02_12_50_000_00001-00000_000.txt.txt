Civil Rights Leader Speaks Homophobia
on Needs of Hispanics

by Debbie Chase

Hispanic Americans are the in-
visible minority in this country.
Though they are the fastest grow
ing ethnic group, they have been
overlooked in employment, iederal
aid, and education, saId Ila R.
Plasencia. who spoke Tuesday
night on “The Barriers to Equality
for Latino American as part of
the week-long Civil Rights Symr

, pbslum.

According to Plasencia.
Hispanic people arc the lowest
paid group in American society,
which she deﬁned to include
whites, Asians, Native Americans,
black, and Hispanics, While the
average annual income tor white
men is 520,335. the average lor
Hispanic men is $14,935, and 39.725
lor Hispanic women, She also said
that a Hispanic woman with a cola
lege diploma earns on the average
the same as a white man with a
high~school diploma.

Other obstacles lacing Hispanics
include the language barrier, lack
of education, and sexist traditional
family roles. Plasencia has tried to
address these problems through
her work on various commissions.

As national VICE president for the
Midwest tor the League of United
Latin , American Citizens
lLULACl, Plasencia has worked to
prevent what she calls ”the drop
out time bomb.” In order to try to
keep youths in school, mom has

Remains Realﬁy

by Julie Slivinsky

“I hope all you homes have a
merry Christmas donning your
gay apparel,"

Graffiti such as the quotation
above, taken from a bathroom wall
on the fourth floor of Burling
Library, indicates that
homophobia, like homosexuality
itscli. is everywhere. '

Although Grinnell has a reputa-
tion as a liberal and tolerant col-
lege, members of the gay com-
munity here say that homophobia.
the fear of homosexuals. exists.
“it's not just graffiti on bathroom
walls," says Alex. a gay

sophomore “it's much more sub-

tle in a lot of Ways. With students in
a class, for example, it they have
someone [in the class] who they've
heard is gay, or who they think is
stereotypically gay, they might not
want to sit next to that person."

This [ear of gays. according to
Carla, another member oi the gay
community, arises irom "ig-
norance and people's intolerance
Also, I think a lot of homophobia
now is a result at people’s igr
norance about AIDS. People are
not willing to think about it. maybe
because they Iear their own sex
uality."

believing that homophobic at-
titudes are more common among

a underclassmen because they've

had little exposure to openly gay
people. "It's more the ireshman

males, I think they feel threatened
by something they know nothing
about and people they know
nothing about. When I ﬁrst came
here, I‘d never really met anybody
who came out and told me they
were gay. I just had to realize that
they're just normal people."

According to lreshman Kachina
Eager, homophobia at Grinnell
might be more prevalent “because
the gay population here is so visi-
ble compared to where I lived
belore. There. you would never see
girls walking around holding
hands,” Todd Brown, a member of
the gay community, also believes
that homophobia results lrom peo
ple not having previous contact
with a gay person Referring to a
homophobic incident last year in
which the posters lor the openly
gay group Romanovsky and
Phillips were deiaced, he says, "1
would make a bet that none of
those responsible has ever known a
gay person There's a big portion
or homopho ics who say gay peo»
ple are evil but have never known
any gay people,”

“The reason I'm not putting a
pseudonym in here is so people can
confront me," Brown continues.
“The stereotypes are very strong,
and i want to show that they're not
always true. I‘m not eileminate,
I'm not into hairdressing, I'm not
promiscuous, and I can beat
straight men at racquetball.”-
