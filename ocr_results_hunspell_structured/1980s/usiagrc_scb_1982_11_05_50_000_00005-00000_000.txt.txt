Maybe it’s just me, but I got the distinct
impression that these lnleiduals were not
being very tolerant oi my views, but then
again, my iriend got that impression too, It
seems to me that the true liberal is a per
son who is tolerant of the opinions of
others. Unfortunately, Grinnell students
oiten seem to iorget this vital component
of liberalism, In fact, what is often practic-
ed is a type oi bigotry and nar-
rowmindedness that is deadly not only
because it falls to accept different views,
but because it stifles the educational pro-
Cess by failing to consider and learn from
these different views,

I'm finding more and more that the
sanctity of individualism, something that
is an Integral Component of most “liberal”
views, is not always practiced in terms oi
personal actions by those who hold these
“liberal" views at Grinnell

My lnquisitors at the Post Office told me
that political activism is a Grinnell tradi»
tlon, I applaud them ior wanting to iollow
in a tradition they believe in, but I question
whether this tradition of activism, of true
liberalism is being iully realized today at
Grinncll. In addition to questioning the
world around us, perhaps we should ques-
tion ourselves, our beliefs and our actions
I hope that bigotry is not a Grinnell trade
tion.

BCW “deceiving"
prospectives

To the Editor:

The idea of a Black Cultural Weekend
does not offend me in the least, Neither do
I mind a weekend for black prospectives I
understand that an effort should be made
to recruit black students since, overall,
there are so few here. What I do resent,
however, is that the two events always
seem to fall on the same weekend.

Grinncll, wrongly or not, does not cater
to its black students in the manner that a
Black Cultural Weekend implies they are
catered to.'Black prospectives here on
Black Cultural Weekend are led to believe
that Grinnell has a larger black population
than it actually does and they are led to
believe that there are more events with
“black" themes than there actually are. Is
the recruitment of black students so dif-
flCult that black prospectives must be
specially brought in on the one weekend
when Grinnell College does manifest its
concern for, and interest in, the black ex-
perience? The combination oi the two
events 7 Black Cultural Weekend and
Black Prospective Weekend 7 is very
deceiving to those students who will
possibly attend Grinnell They will have to
spend iour years and station ii they do
choose to come here. They might as well
see Grinnell as it really is — even if Grins
Hell is not what it ideally should be.

It seems that Admissions is only cons
cerned about the numbers aild not the ac-
tual students. All prospectives, black or
white, receive the royal treatment.
Receiving special attention (Le. tour
guides, eating in the “best" dining hall,
seeing only rooms that have their beds
made, etc.) is one thing. Totally deceiving
those prospectives by inviting them on a
special weekend that occurs only once or
tWice a year is wrong and should not be
standard operating admissions procedure.

BCW article lead
offensive

To the Editor:

Last week an article on Black Cultural
Weekend appeared on the iront page oi the
Scarlet and Black. There was not a name
attached to the article, so I do not know to
whom I should address this letter.
Therefore, it will be addressed to the
editor, Iwould like to say that I, and many
other black students, found the opening
paragraph very degrading and offensive,
The article, despite the first sentence, is
very accurate, so I am not objecting to
everything that was written. However, the
first paragraph, which reads, “Almough

the board to using its iniluence in corpora-
tions for the betterment of society, The
means of influence was to be the
stockholder resolution or proxy resolution.
Such resolutions are initiatives formulated
and voted on by shareholders in a corpora-
tion, calling on the management to carry
out a certain policy. It is clear that the
students who proposed this statement
viewed South African investments as a
case in which the board should exercise
this emical responsibility.

Since 1973, the board has not voted in
favor of any shareholder resolution con-
cerning south African investments, or any
other resolution concerning “the general
welfare,” despite several requests by
students to do so.

It was into this atmosphere that the pre-
sent antieapartheid movement was born.
Because oi the board's inaction and the
failure of shareholder resolutions to make

an impact on corporate policy, students
concluded that a public moral statement of
disapproval through divestment was the
most effective means of working toward
ending Us. corporate support oi apar»
theid. In addition divestment was the
policy for which black leaders in South
Africa were calling, The ensuing three
years have been spent attempting to con
vince the board to adopt this policy This
effort culminated last spring in a confronr
tation between students and the board. The
result was a compromise proposal. In
essence, this proposal asks only that the
board live up to their original 1973 commit
ment and work towards changing core
porate policy in South Africa through
stockholder resolutions.

Today the board has decided to either
accept or reject this proposal, Either
answer brings us to a critical point in Grin-
nell‘s antirapartheid movement. In light of

the board’s behavior, acceptance inust he

Main Hall damages

To the Editor-

We the residents oi Main Hall would like
to iniorm the campus community oi
damages and inconveniences the hall has
suitered as a result or all campus events
held in Main and Gardner Lounges, In the
past, Main Hall has been cooperative and
tolerant in accordance with these events.
However, the same cooperation and
respect has not been returned by those in
attendance.

The iocus oi our concern is the hall
elevator. So far this semester the elevator
has suiiered damages to its padding, walls
and telephone at the times when parties
were being held in the hall. As a result, our
hall iunds have been considerably
depleted, in addition, partygoers have us-
ed the elevator and stairs to go carousing

viewed, at least partially, as an attempt to
paciiy student opinion, the college com-
munity must not allow this to happen. The
goal oi the antirapartheid movement is to
work towards meaningiul change in the
role oi us, corporations in South Africa. It
must therciore use the tools which the
board oiiers towards that end and let it be
known ii those tools prove inadequate.

0n the other hand, it the proposal is re-
jected, it becomes Clear that the board has
no intention oi willingly upholding its 1973
commitment. ln this event the campus
must renew its call ior immediate divest-
merit, using whatever means are ap-
propriate to the task.

No matter what the Board oi Trustees
decides, this is a day on which all those
who oppose Grinnell’s support or apartheid
must make their views known. We urge
that you attend the announcement oi the
board's decision this afternoon at 4:30.

Durkee disagrees
with Stringfellow

To the Editor:

On Oct. 14, the Grinnell community
listened as Dr, William Stringfellow ofr
fercd us his apocalyptic vision oi the
nuclear arms race. .1 shared some of his
ideas, but was both surprised aiid irritated
to hear him repeatedly viliiy nuclear
science and scientists, blaming them for
our current problems In fact, it became”
apparent during the ensuing question
period that Dr Stringtellow had a very
poor opinion of science in general, In the
interests oi iair play, I would like to direct
my comments to two of his favorite
phrases.

1) “The ‘surcalled' scientific method” 7
This method of inquiry. which demands
the meticulous accumulation of data and
the unbiased, rigorous interpretation of
this data. is the only system yet devised
which is capable or providing a solid base
of reliable information which can then be
used to elucidate such disparate
phenomena as the workings oi a cell, the
evolution oia star, or , , radioactivity Dr.
Stringfellow‘s openly cynical attitude is
particularly unfortunate in view or the cur-
rent nationwide Crisis in science educa-
tion It is an ignorance of the scientific
method, its usefulness and its limitations,
that has led many well~meaning, but the
iniormed, people to seriously accept the
doctrine oi “creation science," ior exam»
ple Pandering to such antirintellectualism
exacerbates an already undesirable situa
tion,

2) “Science is immoral" 7 Science, a
way of knowing, is probably best deiined
as “amoral ” The questions a scientist
asks and the dam he obtains are, intrinsi-
cally neither moral nor immoral. For in»
stance, the knowledge that an atom or
U-235, when bombarded by high speed par
ticles, will undergo fission with release of
tremendous quantities or energy is neither
more nor less “good" than the knowledge
that the complicated [lower of an orchid
represents a iusion of originally separate
parts. How knowledge is applied con-
stitutes the real test of morality and an in
iormed, scientiiically literate citizenry is
an important determinant. In turn, it is the
scientist's responsibility to inform the
public; this is especially true when a
potential for abuse exists and is why
workers in recombinant DNA research to
day are making their concerns known and
why hundreds of scientists, in variouis
organized efforts throughout the world,
are protesting the buildup or nuclear
weapons. In the hnal analysis, it is die
morality of society which is reflected in its
uses of science.

In defense of the atomic scientists of the
1940s, it is Worthwhile recalling that they
were commissioned to build a weapon
which would both end the war quickly and,
from the point of View of the US, military
advisers, give an edge over the Soviet
Union, Freeman Dyson, in his popular
book “Disturbing the Universe," writes
that the scientists were certainly morally
justified in pursuing this goal, considering
the Circumstances. Nevertheless, there
was increasing doubt and soulrsearching
among those who knew of the bombs terrir
ble destructive iorce, Many attempts were
made to communicate these concerns to
the president. it is now apparent, 40 years
later, that Truman was never iniormed oi
these petitions (one might say they were
suppressed) and his final decision to use
the bomb was iniluenced almost wholly by
the generals Therein lies a lesson for all of
us. e Lenore T, Durkee, assistant pro-
fessor of biology
