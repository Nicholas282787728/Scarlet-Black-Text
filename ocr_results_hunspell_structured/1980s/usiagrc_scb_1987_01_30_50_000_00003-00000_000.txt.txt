was very interested in teaching at a small
liberal arts school in the Midwest.
Commenting on the hiring process,
Voertman said, “the applicant pool was

creased 38% over last year (723 total), But
as of January 23. only 19 completed apr
plications had been received in the admis»
sions office. Akins said that applications
from black students usually continue to
come in after the deadline. and he ex-

pected the tinal number ol applications to .

“at least equal" last year’s total at 58.
Akin wants to utilize the airwaves as
well as the phoneiines and printed page to

students," Akins commented, “but I say
we want black students and will do
anything to get them here."

More traditional recruiting methods
often take Akins on the road to Baltimore,
Cleveland, St. Louis and Washington, Dc,
to name a few cities. “I try to visit
predominately black high schools in thﬁe
areas and let them know what Grinnell is
about,” he said “I always encourage them

advertising is in the planning stages right
now,” he said, “The ads will be speciiieal-
ly targeted at black students, and should
increase the number of inquiries, which
will increase our applicant pool.” He con-
ceded that this approach might be criticiz-
ed, but maintains the worthiness oi the ef-

Shuttle

Pam Feinstein, a member of the
Women's Group. Said, “In the past [our
years the Women's Group has been work-
ing to get a shuttle set up and couldn't [ar-
range lor a shuttlel." However, reinstein
and other women wanted a free shuttle
service or to have the college cover the gas
costs. two porposals that Tederman
refuses to support.

Feinstein also said, “Male doctors can’t
give you the same kind oi emotional sup-
port, prognosis, and price that a woman
doctor and a specialized women’s health
care clinic can give," Feinstein continued,

to visit the campus:..the school sells

Along with minority recruiting, Akins is
also responsible ior all recruiting in the
southern United States. When asked if
these additional duties hindered his
minority recruiting etiorts, Akins respond-
ed. “1 can concentrate on all Students. You
do have to keep up with more thirigs, but
the concentration is on black students.”

car [from the college] and go.
renting a car from the college is $0.17 per
mile, but Tederman was quick to point out
that the cost at the car is subsidized, since
it costs 30.45%.50 per mile to maintain and
run a car.

Tederman added, “If there's one fault of
Student Affairs [in the women’s health
care issue], it's that we haven’t taken an
active enough role in getting women
grouped together [to rent cars from the
collegel.”

According to Jim Work, director of Sum-
‘mer Programs and the college car pool,

 

Women’s group members said their shuttle plans
"were met with dmbivdlence.”

 

“We pay money each semester for health
service, but then we have to pay additional
money for birth control and exams , . . and
it falls on women more often than on men
to take care of birth control."

Jim Tederman, dean of Student Affairs,
said a shuttle ran approximately a or 9
years ago. in the past Sor Ayears, a shuttle
was arranged to transport women to a
clinic in Cedar Rapids, but “they [the
Women's Group] decided not to involve the
administration," Tederman said. The pro-
blem cited by Tederman for a shuttle ser-
vice is filling the van. As an alternative,
Tederman suggested “2 or 3 women could
go to Marshailtown, ior example, and get a

the shuttle “is an experiment _ you can
poll people about intentions [on their inten-
tion to use the shuttle], but whether they
actually do something is another matter.”

The acting president oi son, Ali ElSafr
tar. developed the shuttle service with the
help ol'Tederman EISailarsaid, “I wasn’t
aware or the issue [the women’s health
care shuttle] at all 7 it [the Des Moines
shuttle] wasn't intended as an insult.”

An option currently under consideration
by some members oi the Women’s Group
is the possibility ol using the shuttle to get
to Planned parenthood clinics and private
physicians in Des Moines.
