Corporate Lesson

Perhapr orte of the most intererting
complaints to arise from the recent
unveiling of the new college logo root
the observation tltat Grinnell College is
now being run more like a corporation
than an institution of higher learning.
The pretentiou: interior of Mean Coo
iage and the high—gloat, high-profile im.
age prerented by the adminititmtian
are all seen to haoe an appearance that
is better tailedfor a multimational cor-
poration than a small Midwestern
liberobartt college. But implied in the
ncgaiicc opinionr on Crinnell'r new
slick corporate look it the ottumpiion
tlial anything of a corporate or
haunt-tr nature is inappropriate for a
college with higher aspirations than the
maximizing of profit.

It may be beneficial for a college to
distinguish ilitclf front a corporation,
but thit it not to toy that elements of
corporate administration are utelorr at

iicnlor, iltc ability to maintain compe—
toni personnel is one area in which
Crinncll College could benefit from a

Although tome may not like
(r'ritlnell'k now corporate look, the Cal-
lege could greatly benefit from adap-
iingapertonnel polic_ that rewards
achievement and eliminates in-
competence in the faculty rnnltt.

It is a common practice among Grin»
nell nudenu and students of small
Colleges ‘ nationu-ide to
choose a course bored on the quality of

a broad consensus among students

Here too, one can find at many col.

Simply put, the quality of education
at Grinnell and other colleges isgreotly
hindered by the antiquated policy of
tenure that has continued to keep in»

at the Border

By Marty Myslcwski

“A lot of how you stand on an issue
depends on where you sit." I don’t recall
whether I first read this in a fortune
cookie, on a tea bag or some other source
at prulound wisdom, but I thought there
was a lot of truth to it. Regarding the reac-
tions of several different European coun-
tries in the weeks following the meltdown
at Chernobyl, [came to doubt its truth, or
at least its universal applicability

It seemed logical to me that the more
radiation 3 country received, me greater
the overall reaction against nuclear power
would be, I was wrong. Sweden was the
first country to notice signs oi the
meltdown and to bring it to the attention at
the Soviet Union and the world. Relative to
West Germany, the Scandinavian Counr
tries received three to tour times the
radiation, but their reactions were cone
Siderably less.

Rebecca Cowen, an American studying
in Freiburg, spent the Plingsten holiday
(Pentecost) in Sweden with her host lami-
ly from a liighrschool exchange. She did
not return with stories at great protests,
but of something like a news blackout. Not
just the media was quiet, but the people
She knew as well. They didn't talk much
about Chernobyl or the radioactive clouds,
and when they did, their references were
to “red clouds" and “SuViet clouds." In
1933, Sweden was 43% dependent on
nuclear power (Monthly Energy Review
Sept. 1984) and t have heard that now the
dependency is over 50%.

“The clouds stop at the border!" The
first time I heard it, I thought it was a joke,
but indeed, this phrase headlined French
newspapers. Contrary to this absurd
claim, the wind and clouds did not
recognize the integrity oi the French
borders. Radiallon levels in the Vogesen
Mountains, Just cast or the Rhine rose to
rough parity with those in West Germany’s
Black Forest. Still, the media reaction was
weak It came as no surprise to learn that
France is over 50% dependent on nuclear
power.

In talking with Grinnellians who were in
Stirling last spring and a Scotsman i met
in Iceland, l got the impression that
pessimism was the general Scottish at-
titude toward Chernobyl The words that
stick in my mind are “if this doesn't get us,
something else Will." Initially the English
regarded the event as something that con-
cerned the Scottish, but not themselves, as
the clouds did not pass over England. The
BBC made lighl oi the Scottish Situation

luntil midsummer, when the government
iarbid the slaughter oi lambs and pigs tor
Wales, England and Scotland because of
unsafe radiation levels. People were
outraged that they could no longer get
mutton and other meats. In all fairness.
Chernobyl did generate political activity
as well as a sense oi personal inconve
mence, A proposed nuclear reactor in
Scotland was voted down.

Anyone who has traveled through East
Germany has noticed a lack oi quality con-
sumer goods. This isn’t because East Ger-
many doesn’t produce quality, but instead
because the East German government
sells the quality goods to western buyers.
Chernobyl changed that, even if only for a
short While and East Germans were happy
to have quality goods, despite the radiance
live contamination. Western governments
set radiation limits [or vehicles and prOV
ducts coming irom Easier European coun~
tries and would not allow anytiing con-
taminated above these limits across their
borders, As a result,» the quality
vegetables, dairy products, etc, ended up
in East German markets. Many East Gerr
mans had never seen iamihar produce or
grade-one quality, Asparagus or any quali-
ty was available for the first time in over
lorty years,

Early in the summer l wrote to an East
German acquaintance and asked what he
had heard about the accident at Cher-
nobyl. He wrote “about your question
about how well inlormccl we were about
the reactor accident by the newspapers,
radio, and television: ‘Everything that is
dangerous in the immediate area [of the
reactor] will be dealt with by whichever
security measures are necessary, The
Western media is trying to create a panic
to divert attention tram unemployment,
hunger. exploitation and the war-mongers.’
I couldn't find anything more."

It still leaves me cold, Few Countries
showed their first interest as the health
and \vellrbeing of their people. High
dependencies on nuclear power Corr
responded to low media reaction and a
quiet public, Distance irom the accident
and the [act that it was a Soviet reactor
made some believe that a similar accident
wouldn't or couldn't happen to them. Here
in the United States, I'm no! Sure whether
to be comiorted by our low dependence on

nuclear power (13.5% in 1934: Monthly
Energy Review' Sept. 1985) or concerned
because we have more nuclear plants on
line and under construction than any other
country,
