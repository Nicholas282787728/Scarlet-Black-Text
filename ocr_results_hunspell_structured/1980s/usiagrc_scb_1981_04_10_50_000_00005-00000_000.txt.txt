0/ last Friday's spring storm.

High winds last Friday night caused
heavy damage in Grinnell and many
residents are convinced that a tornado
actually struck the area, Damage in
town was widespread as mobile homes
were wrecked, windows blown’ out,
roofs ripped off and debris thrown into
the air and driven into the ground, The
storm's toll on campus included the loss
of three large trees

A tornado watch was in effect most of
the evening and eventually became a
tornado warning {or Jasper, Poweshiek
and Mahaska counties, Not everyone on
campus knew of the warnings,
however, and most students planned to
carry out their scheduled activities for
the evening in spite of the wind and rain
which, early on, appeared to be only a
thunderstorm '

The Grinnell Singers gave their
spring concert in Herrick Chapel under
most unusual circumstances Trouble
began even before the performance
started with the rain coming through
the Chapel‘s upper windows onto the
audience. No sooner were the windows
closed than the concert manager. Mark
Lawrence, noticed that the inner doors
on the Chapel lobby were drenched with
rain being driven sideways through the
open outer doors, Lawrence found it
next to impossible to close the heavy
outer doors because of the force of the
wind

Then the lights went out. Fortunately,
a few candles were available. including
the candelabra in the front of Herrick.
So the Singers gave a candlelight cone
cert One performer commented that it

was fun but eerie to look out on an au»
dience illuminated by {our candles and
occasronal flashes of lightning, The
lights Came back on at the moment the
group sang "lumi miei Cari," which
means .“bring the light back to me,"

Meanwhile, the Concerned Black
Students were giving a performance or
famous negro speeches in Arena
Theater. Anthony Murry was givtng a
speech by Eldridge Cleaver, "On
Becoming " and had just said the words
“What is it like to be black in white
America" when the lights went out, The
group was in total darkness as Arena
has no windows to even let in the lights
ning. Again candles were brought out
and the performance continued. In the
interim before the candles were lit
Russell Pierce began a speech by Mar-
tin Luther King which he had memoriz»
ed. Leslie Taylor, a member of the cast,
thought the program was even more elr

Iective in the dim light

Folk dancers rehearsing in Darby
Gym found themselves in the middle oi
the lloor when the power failed. After
some confusion, many oi the dancers
formed a chain and cautiously made
their way to the basement. Others con-
tinued dancing in the dark,

Life guards Anne Kosek and Jenny
Taylor had their jobs cut out for them
during the outage because the PEG pool
was full of young children. Kosek said,
"We really didn't know what was hap-
pening because there are no windows in
the pool area " All of the kids started
shrieking when the lights went out but
the guards ordered everyone out of the
water and checked for stragglers With
flashlights kept in the pool office.

The lockerer was a chaotic scene
with the kids unable to find their
underwear, money, etc. Eventually the
Children calmed down and Kosek called
the evening "an experience,"

During the second power failure of
the night, the worst part or the storm,
many people were outside, unaware of
any danger of a tornado. The winds _
were strong enough to blow pedestrians
from their paths and bicyclists had lit-
tle chance of success, Quite a few
students rushed outside during the
storm believing it to_ be "the best
weather to be out in." according to one
rain and wind enthusiast.

Others were content to stay indoors,
glad the lights were out so they would
not have to study. A group in German
House sat in the hall eating cheese and
crackers and drinking sparkling cider.
Another of these happy students took a
shower in the dark.

But while some students were
delighting in the storm, most were sit-
ting in the darkened pits or the dorms.
Jeffrey Montague, resident adviser for
Clark, Dibble and Rawson Halls, was in ,
communication with the fire depart-
ment and called the other resident ad-
visers to tell them to get Students into
the basementsr

Read residents were in their pit until
the electrical storm hit a heat pump
and the smoke odor forced them out.
They moved, next, to Loose pit. Warn-
ing sirens were not sounded because,
according to Grinnell Police Chief and
CiVil Defense Director Bill Peters, in
the Grinllell Herald-Register, ”We
were out looking , . i could have blown
sirens all night, I suppose, but I don't
like to unless I know for sure [that a tor-
nado has been spotted],"

Whether or not there really was a tor-
nado is still debatable. Townspeopie
whose homes were ruined think a tor-
nado must have caused the destruction
but the police maintain that a twister
was never sighted. Whatever happen
ed. this was the first such storm for
many Grinnell students and some say
they will behave quite differently the
next time the lights go out,
