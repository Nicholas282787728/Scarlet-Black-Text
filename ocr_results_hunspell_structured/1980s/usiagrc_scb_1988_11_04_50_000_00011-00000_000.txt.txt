Action-adventure resurrected

in Midnight Run

by Brian Strause

With the action adventure
spinning down the drain of the
American ethos, it took no other
than Robert De Niro to resurrect
a genre where the punch of Stal-
lone and the pow of
Schwarzenegger have failed to
translate into box ofﬁce receipts.
In the most humorous role of his
career and perhaps the best movie
of last summer, De Niro demon-
strates his wide range of acting
ability in Midnight Run. How-
ever. while De Niro's perfor-
mance is amazing, the very
foundation of this ﬁlm also is
brilliant. Screenwriter George
Callo has structured a witty plot
that wraps hilarious dialogue and

‘ nail-biting action into an explo-
sive entertainment package, while
Charles Grodin offers an excep-
tional ponrayal of a white collar
"criminal" who preaches against
the sins of smoking and fried
foods.

De Niro plays Jack Walsh,
an exVChicago cop turned LrAl
bounty hunterr With $100,000
staring him in the face, Jack

jumps at the prospect of retum-
ing bail-jumper Jonathan Mar-
dukas (Charles Grodin) back to
his bondsmanr The trip will take
the two from New York back to
LA, a simple "midnight run."
of course, there are a few obstar
cles in the way, namely the FBI,
the Maﬁa, and Marvin Dorfler; a
competing bounty hunter who
lives up to his name Mardukas
is not exactly your basic hardened
criminal, He once worked as the
accountant for a Mafia family
from whom he embezzled mil-
lions of dollars... giving it all to
charity. A modern day Robin
Hood. Mardukas' morality grates
on De Niro‘s Jack, paving the
way for much of the humor ala
The Odd Couple

Intoxicating throughout,
this ﬁlm breathes of life and per-
haps will pave the way for a new
beginning in a genre plagued by
macho beasts with two dimen»
sional acting abilities and single

Rock and Fioll High School

by Matt Macho
Rock and Roll High
School is a vapid, brainless, and
‘ utterly sophomorie romp, dedi-
cated to the celebration of muSlc.
‘ Rock and Roll music. Rock and
_ Roll music by the Ramones, if
you want to get really precise.
‘ The Ramones, in case you
‘ haven't heard of them (what a
pity), are a hard rock/thrashpunk
band out of New York City, are
‘ guably the spark that ignited
Punk rock in the 70's. I suppose
this can either make them Gods
( or the spawn of Satan, depending
on how you feel about Punk.
‘ The Ramones sing about drugs.
. insanity, crime, and urban
desolation, occasionally hitting
‘somc heavy topics but rarely
' taking themselves too seriously
I suppose the sound could be de-
< scribed as Led Zeppelin on am-
” phetamines. Plenty of the .
Hits like "Teenage Lobotomy",
- "Hey Ho, Let‘s Go", and of
, course "Pinhca " are prominently
featured in the ﬁlm’s live concert,
‘which is complete with an au-
. thentic pre-concert "oh shit. we're
on in two minutes... someone
‘ revive Joey" scene.

< . The plot (HA!)9.[.U16,

movie' centers 'around some high

school kids who love the Ra-
mones, who are coming to play
in their hometown. (Obviously
this movie takes place in a locale
other than Grinncll). This one
chick wants to give the band
songs she's written for them, one
nice-looking but pathetic guy
who's in love with her gets into
the band so he can take her out
(this "romantic angle" actually
has its funny moments), and of
course the kids in general want to
thrash their brains out. This
psychobitch principal of the
school and her retarded fascist
cronies hate the Ramones, and
organize a massive hunting of all
their records in town, It's ok
though, 'cause Johnny, Joey,
Tommy, and Dee Dee come to
school and blow it up. Too bad

ARI-I isn't next on their agenda. '

oh?

This is a pretty fun movie
as long as you don‘t expect too
much Those who really dig the
Ramoncs will have a blast.
Those who don't like the Ra-
mones, go back to your hope-
lessly dull and cutesy Suzzannc
Vega and Michael Jackson
garbage. Gabba Gabba Hey.

Meaning of Life

by Matt Macho

While ﬁlm critics agreed
that Meaning of Life was not the
greatest Python film ever. it's a
lot of fun, and since when have
ﬁlm critics liked a fun ﬁlm? It's
also likely to be the last Python
ﬁlm ever -- the gang broke up a
few years ago and the members
have gone their separate ways,
occassionally collaborating on
individual projects such as Brazil
but unlikely to reform as a
group.

Meaning of Life focuses
on the "Big Questions", such as
birth, work, education, and death,
which results in a chaotic jumble
of sketches of varying quality.
This is nothing new for the
Pythons, but the ﬁlm does suffer
somewhat from a lack of unity;
one reason why The Holy Grail
may be a better ﬁlm. But then
lots of people prefer the less-
structured Python madness only a
collection of sketches can pro-
vide.

Some of the scenes are ter—
rific. measuring up to some of
their finest work on their old
BBC shows, "Sex Education,"
"Live Organ Transplants." and
"Medicine" are hilarious, and
provide that really vicious biting
social commentary that only the
Pythons cant I also liked the
supplemental section to "Birth,"
entitled "Birth--the third world
(Liverpool),u Anti who can keep a
straight face as the doctors gloat
over their "machine that goes
’Bingt'" even as they forget to
wheel the patient into the operat-
ing room? Or as the schoolmas-
ter asks his inattentive pupils
how to get the vaginal juices
ﬂowing?

Some scenes just don't
measure up. Some are pretty
dull, or run on too long with the
same joke. There's also a lot
more low brow humor in this
film than in previous efforts.
Granted, the Pythons always have
lots of fun with tastelessness and
shocking subject matter, but they
never did anything like the ten-
minutc vomit scene (yes, that's
right -- I didn‘t time it. but there's
a LENGTl-IY vomit scene in this
movie). But hey, this is Grin-

ncll, and no doubt most of the
audience will love iL

Have fun with Meaning of
Life; there's lots to enjoy. But
the squeamish among you may
wish to go to another movie. Or
stay home and read a book. Or
march up and down the square.

American Frontier Film Series:
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance

by Georgia Dentel

The Man Who Shot Lib-
erly Valance (1962) is probably
the most widely analyzed and
discussed of the Ford westerns.
The ﬁlm contrasts the old frontier
West ("The Wilderness") with the
emerging West ("The Garden"),
thereby, according to writer David:
Coursen, "giving Ford opportu-
nity to make of it a meditation
on a large part of the mythic ter-
ritory which he invented and em-
bellished in more than four
decades of ﬁlm making." (That
is, Ford is able to question the
myth on which he based all his
other ﬁlms.)

In many Ford films,
particularly those dealing with
the military, and also in Liberty
Valance, the focus is on subordi-
nation of the individual will to a
collective struggle, which is
usually represented by a nuclear
family, The individual is subor-
dinated for some greater good --
lo civilize the frontier. However,
throughout the ﬁlm Ford clearly
questions whether the outcome
justiﬁes the sacriﬁces required,

Symbolism and irony
abound: note in particular the
schoolroom scene, the repeated
destruction of pages representing
law and truth, the severe contrasts
between the early and modern
town of Shinbone. the contrast

between Tom's and Liberty's
horses. the trains which dominate
the landscape, the freeing of the
horses as Tom's ranch burns,
Liberty's one and only use of a
wagon as opposed to a horse, the
use of a horse at the territorial
convention, and the ﬁnal scene
on the train. Interestingly, Ford
uses the same theme music in
Liberty Valance as he used in
Young Mr, Lincoln. However,
in Lincoln. writer Coursen points
out, "the music evokes a consis
tent set of feelings" about Ann
Rutledge and her confidence in
Aber's ability to attain important
objectives. In Liberty Valance.
on the other hand, the theme is
associated with idealized and ob»
viously unobtainable objectives.
Liberty Valance is a story
of villainy and love. Tom, who
cannot ultimately fit into the
pattern of the film's family, is
played by John Wayne in one of
his best roles, James Stewart
plays Rnase Stoddard, and villain
Liberty is played by Lee Marvin.
Although uncharacteristic of Ford
in its somewhat slower pace,
Liberty Valance rewards the
viewer with its character devel-
opment, symbolism, and eventu-
ally with is surprise ending.

The film is a bitter-sweet
thriller which makes comment
about women on a number of
levels as well as on values such
as loyalty, friendship, and re-
sponsibility. Fonda and Red-

the film, but it is dominated by
the power of I-Iellman's story.
