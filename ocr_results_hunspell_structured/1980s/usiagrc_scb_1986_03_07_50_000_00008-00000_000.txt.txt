As narrated by James Embryo

The Nenturnians being a happy lot. the
ne which our two progtagonists (sheep?)
bumped into smiled his big, teethefilled
mile and said, “Pardon me, kind
fellows!“

The precise identity oi this Nenturnian
remains in some doubt. Due m secrecy
which has always surrounded Nenturnia
(the only planet in me Galaxy whose in-
habitants are truly happy and well-
rounded), information concerning in—
dividual Nenturnians has always proved
difficult to attain. Modern historian and
archdukes have more or less unanimously
come to the conclusion, however, that this
particular Nenturnian was named F137,
which means (in Nenturnian, as far as we
unhappy humans have been able to tell),
“He who romps in the shaded wooden
valleys of the West, and who loves all
leaves at once.” -

F137 led a somewhat unusual life, [or he
was born to three parents. (Most Nentur-
nians. [or some unexplained (and unex-
plicible?) reason have five.) Soon after
this, he attempted mass murder, which
labeled him (on the oh so happy world of
Nenturnia) an instant outcast.

l-lence, his presence on earth.

Hence, his joy at being nearly knocked
over by two fat, meaty, tasty—looking
sheep irom the upper atmosphere. Oh yes.

The-Tales of Tris and 'Ella .

weird reader, F137 new that Tris and
Ella had lived in the clouds: he knew why;
he knew where.

“Entschuldigen Sie, bitte,” Said Tris,
with characteristic eloquence. .

“Don‘t mind me,” said F137. “1 was in
the way. In fact. in recompense for the
obstinant obtrusiveness l have displayed
so far in this hitherto-unexpected en»
counter, please accept apologies from me
and from every member of my (glorious)
race, and please feast with me tonight in
my elaborate hut.” , ‘ '

Tris and Ella glanced at each other,
bleated, and hence acquiesced.

Oh, dear reader, to what miserable fate
have our sheep exposed themselves? In
what orgy of Nenturnian unrepentance
have they become embroiled? Lo again:
the world awaiE, with breathlessness.
