The privilege of graffiti

To the editor: On March 11, I was in
the process oi drawing a Snoopy on
theewall oi the Burling Library men's
room in blue Magic Marker when
Steve Pandolfo entered. He has now,
as I understand, brought vandalism
charges against me ior writing
several things on those walls in blue
marker. I don‘t think it would be
unreasonable to assume that another
student might own a blue marker, and
have been responsible for the other
markings~but, nevertheless, there is
no question that I did mark on the
wall.

But this is a trivial point, the ques-
tion is one of principles. When I was a
prospective student last year, my tour
guide took me into that washroom to
show me the gratiiti there, proudly exr
plaining it as an old tradition. I was
impressed—both by the quality or the
grafﬁti (substantially more mature,
meaningful and/Dr liomorous than
what I had seen in high school
bathrooms) and by the reflection of
student ireedom it represented. And
on page 72 oi the “Go” Handbook that
I received from the Admissions

Department it said that the Bui'liiig
bathroom walls were the place to go to
“find out current campus scuttlebutt "
The graffiti ivas presented as an at
tribute oi the college, andl saw it as
such (incidentally, so did my parents).

Until several‘years ago, there was a
faculty~judged contest between the
two washrooms called the “Toilet
Bowl" in which the best graffiti was
chosen I do not think it can be denied
uiat drawing and writing on the Bur-
ling bathroom walls has been at least
tacitly, it not explicitly, sanctioned by
the administration as a privilege or
the students. Even though it does lit
Webster's definition of vandalism, I do
not think i can be justly penalized ior
exercising such a privilege.

If the Administration no longer
wishes to recognize this privilege,
which would be uniortunate, the policy
change should be publicly announced
before being considered legitimate,
And if the crusade for clean walls is
owing entirely to Mr. Pandolfo, he
should work through the established
channels to implement a policy
change beior'e enforcmg one

to the editor

While making and eiiiorciiig a grate
[ill policy, the administration is oblig-
ed to consider both the attributes of
graiiiti and the opinion oi the college
community, as well as the complaints
made against it, The value oi graiiiti
as a means oi expression and coma
munication and as a liberty oi the para
tiClpants has been established more
than once in sociological studies.
when the People’s Republic or China
established iree walls ior its people to
write on, the action was praised
around the world.

The opinion or the community is not
in opposition to graiiiti either. The
ieeling oi the student body is iairly
evident in the petition of ovel‘ 700
signatures I have presented to the
Judicial Council The pelition includes
the signatures of several prospectives,
and of one prospective's parent, In-
terestingly, even the parents who did
not sign were impressed-by the idea of
tree walls, and seemed sympathetic, it
not disappointed, that this privilege
was being rescinded. One student told
me that during the recent reunion he
was in the Burling washroom when an
alum walked in and asked, somewhat
surprised, where all the graffiti was.
The student told him that it was being
scrubbed off daily, The alum said he
was dissappointed, he had gone down
to the washroom exclusively to see the
graiiiti upon arriving here

As was pointed out to me by Mr.
Worley, a distinction should be made
between creative and destructive grai-
fiti which is only hostile and destrucr
live This can't be condoned by
anyone. But there is a-lot oi
humorous, mature, thoughtiul graiiiti
which is respectable as a means oi
communication.

The Bul'liilg walls used to have an
impressively high proportion oi
"good" grattiti. There isn't a public
washroom in the world that is \vithoul
graititi, and in trying to make ours so,
the “good" graiiiti has been lost and
all that's left is hostility and destrucs
tion, .

On Monday. April 2i, 1 met with
steve, at his request, to discuss the
case. ,,

After some discussion, I realized
that the real problem was not graiiiti
in the bathrooms, but elsewlici’eilike
the East and West Carrel walls of the
Library, whlcli can't be washed, I pro
posed that the bathroom walls be
declared [air ground for graiiiti, and
that studcnts would be willing to con.
fine it to them. Steve said he had been
thinking oi the same thing, so the
charges were dropped alld the matter
