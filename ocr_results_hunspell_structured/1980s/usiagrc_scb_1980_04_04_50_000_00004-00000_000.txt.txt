As everyone must know by now,
another physical assault took place in
Grinnell the week before spring break.
What was most frightening to many
campus women is that it occurred on
campus, on the sidewalk approaching
Steiner and Goodnow Hall from the
library.

The victim, an offcampus student,
informed the Office of Student Affairs
at 4 pm. the next day that at about i
am Tuesday morning she was ap
proached from behind and pulled into
some bushes by a man wearing a ski
mask. Another masked man was
waiting in the bushes. The two told her
not to scream, and that they were
”only" going to rough her up a litue.
She was thrown to the ground and
kicked repeatedly, She managed to
tell them that the library would be
closing soon and that people would be
coming by on their way home. Her
assailants than left on foot.

The victim received painful
bruises—nothing serious enough to see
a docwriand the assult did not seem
to be sexual in nature, but this third
incident of violence (after the sexual
assault incidents of a month earlier)
has stirred fresh worries in the minds
of many women and strengthened
their resolve to do something about
their vulnerability.

Recent assault spurs

Immediately following news or (ht:
assault on March 11. rumors about at
least two onrcampus rapes supposedly
committed last semester began to pro
literate. Among them were tales of a
rape in Darby gym. Although Susan
wittpenn, assistant dean of Student
Affairs, had heard of a few of these
rumors “through the grapevine," cl-
forts to track them down have been
fruitless. “No other cases of physical
assault have been reported to this of
{ice or to the police," she stated.

Results of this new wave of concern
for personal safety have taken many
different forms. Janet Carl, associate
dean of Student Affairs, enumerated
several steps being taken at a meeting
of the National Organization for
Women on April ist

Among the measures are an escort
service, organized by the campus
women‘s group, and a seminar on
rape sponsored by the Oliice ol Stu-
dent Affairs. The seminar, scheduled
for April 17, is designed lor the college
staff, members of the pollce force and
mental health center, other people in
the community, and a limited number
of students. Those interested in atten-
ding should Contact the Office of Stu-
dent Affairs.

One group of concerned women is
studying campus lighting in order to
make recommendations for extra

lights in problem spots. Book store
manager Thomas Mchc is looking in-
to tho possihhty of buying whistles to
be used as distress signals. In addition
to the scII defense workshop held
before break, a sclfrdefense class is
now being offered Tuesday and Tours-
day nights in the PEG

The most important outgrowth of
the recent assaults has been a renew-
ed effort to educate potential victims
and the police. Wlttpelln stresses that
any incident of assault or harassment
should be reported to the Office of Stur
dent Affairs. Victims art: not forced to
report to the police, and they may
keep their report anonymous, The or-
{ice is developing a list oi names of
people to accompany an individual at
the police illtcrvlcw, should the illcir
dent be reported.

A good rapport with the police is imr
portant, Wittpcnll says. She recom-
mends Detective Doug Shutts as a
good person to ask for when reporting
cases of assault.

Response to the most recent assault
and the two previous incidcnts has
come from various campus and come
munity groups, who stress that
widespread community awareness and
precautionary measures will alleviate
a problem that is not llmitcd to large

_ urban areas, but occurs even in quite
rural towns like Grinnell.
