Black religion’s struggle, part II '“s‘°""-Pi“'°°

The initial purpose of the indepen-
dent black churches was to serve as a
medium of expression and as a means

‘of solidifying the black community.

“It is a credit to the humanity of black
people that they recognized their
presence in white services as an ad-
junct of slavery. Therefore, many-of
them left before being expelled. For
this reason we may describe the black
churches during this period as a place
of retreat from the dehumanizing
forces of white power. It was one
place in which the blacks were safe
from the racist structures that replac-
ed slavery. The Black Church gradual-
ly became an instrument of escape in-
stead of, as formerly, an instrument of
protest."

One of the leading figures in the
development of independent black
churches was Richard Allen. He was
born a slave in Philadelphia in the
year 1760; his master allowed him to
preach to the field hands. Later, Allen
was ordained as deacon in 1799 and
was appointed the first African Bishop
in ms, He is considered by many to
be the founder of the African
Methodists Episcopal Church. (An ex»
cellent book to read concerning Allen
and other blacks is MEN OF MARK.
William .1. Simmons.) In time,the
Black church became the lifeblood of
the American black. For black people
were tired of being ostracized and be-
ing compelled to sit in the back seats
in the sanctuary of the Lord. Their
souls were further shocked and rocked
by being denied communion of the
Lord’s supper until all the white
members had partaken. “The result
was not the religious sanctification of
the present. but a break-away from
the present toward the future."

The black man‘s religious history in
this country was marked by hypocrisy
on the part of whites who claimed to
be pious while [orsaking their fellow
brethern. Nevermeless, and in spite of
all, the black man has survived the
test of despair to come to a new
realization of his self. He continues to
be in the process of redefinition; what
is religion, and what Night it be?

Reverends Emmit wiseman and
Walter Fluker discussed the role of
black religiousity during Black
Theology Week. What follows is a cap-
tion of how they see religion, how they
feel about it, in the context of
domestic uncertainty.

Reverend Wiseman

The world today is in a state of
madness Our leaders are like
demons. The people have become
shattered, broken, fragmented and
devoid of self, The political unrest in
the world, the domestic frustration is
a sign that indicates man is not in con-
trol of himself. He has failed to control
his destiny. He has let his thoughts
and actions wither away as chaff on a

tree. He is forever involved in a game
of defining himself—trying to be
something he is not. Man could find
himself if he were to realize his rela-
tion with God. Man could find himself
if he had a working relationship with a
spiritual force and background. We
live in a time when man and woman
have lost contact with each other; we
live in a time where man has become
morally corrupt and debased; man
has become like a tool—a rob0t~his
behavior appears to be programmed
and conditioned. Marl must become
rehabilitated, His identity can be
restored with the aid of Christ. Human
madness is rocking the world today.
This madness is reﬂected in all areas.
of life. Industry, government, and
education are all involved in this
madness, this loss of purpose and
direction, And the problem is that
madmen are in power. The world has
nothing to give young people. The
youngwiil inherit frustration, Christ
can help us to turn madness into
mildness. Sin may leave one shat-
tered, but Jesus can give one a name.
He can unify. Those who have been
healed have a glorious story to tell.
Better to be strange and have a story
to tell, .

Reverend Fluker

The black church emphasized com-
munity, family and togetherness. Our
history as black people makes our
religious tradition different. The Black
Church preserves culture; it is a
custodian of culture; it is a training
ground for future leaders. The Black
Church does not preach anti-white or
anti~integratiorl—the church has a
philosophy of informing the white
community to accept black people as
black people, not as something or
someone to be molded into a good
Christian. The philosophy of the
church is inform the world to accept
the black man’s blackness. Accept us!

The Black Church promotes educae
tion and stability. The purpose of the
church is to teach Christ and this does
not mean that one has to be limited to
the churchhouse; this does mean that
the church is to be involved in only
sectarian affairs. The line between

sectarian and secular interests has V ,
already been drawn; Render to
Caesar all that is Caesar’s. God helps
the oppressed—and blacks have been"
oppressed. The purpose of the Black
Church is not to be separatistmits aim
is to stress a black ideology.

Racism and classisrn are in-
separable and the failure of this soci-
ety is inevitable because people are
not taking the word of God seriously.

The black family has not been .
broken when one thinks that the fami-
ly has never been together. This was
the result of the slave regime. But the
feeling of filial piety is strong in the. -
black community. The problem today
is that people too often think of
themselves as being the center of the,
universe; they have become too scien-
tific, too rational and less and less
humanistic. Blacks today are still in-
volved in a thrust for freedom.

No, the black man does not preach
the White man’s religion—Christianity
has always‘existed i Ethiopia,and
turthermore,the reli on of the master
has not been accepted.

I agree with W.E.B. Du Bois when
he said that the Negro preacher is the
most unique, political, and interesting.
The preacher is the apex of greatness.

“The black church was the creation
of a black people whose daily ex-
istence was an encounter with the
overwhelming and brutalizing reality ,
of white power...The black church
became die home base for revoiu» . '
tion."

Today the black church remains the
symbol of hope and progress in a ' '
world that is becoming more and
more tragic. The black man's search 3
for a place in American society is a» .
continual journey~but a sojourn that
must be made with increasing rapidi-
ty. The church of today must not yield
to forebearance but must get involved
in those societal problems that
threaten the fiber of the soul and tear
at the flesh of humanity. The black,
church does not represent an accep-
tance of the white man’s religion—the
black church stands as monument of
black men and women in search of
Self.
