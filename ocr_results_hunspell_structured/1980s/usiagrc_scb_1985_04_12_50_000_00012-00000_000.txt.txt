Opinion and Editorial

Consider this, in a recent column in the Des
Moines Register, it was noted that of the 2.2
million Blacks living in South Africa, only
2,200 are employed by companies which pro
vide equal pay and opportunities for advance-

ment to Blacks and Whites alike.

Letters to the Editor

To The Editor:

In the February, 1985 edition at The
Grinnell Outcry. the Relays committee
put iorth their view as to why lielays
should not be abolished, The tinal argu»
ment printed states that:

“Relays is an event which
unities the student body each sprr
ing: it is a weekend devoted to the
simple. unadulterated pursuit of
tun. It is an opportunity to ignore
the impending exam week. an 6%
cuse to wave hello to the rest oi
the campus. and a weekend to
relax on the manicured lawns 01
our beloved College. We believe
that Relays will allow students to
vent some academic steam. clear
their heads, and realize that they
shouldn't take themselves too
seriously in the weeks ahead."

While these are indeed nobel ideals,
atter examining the date chosen upon
which to hold the event they seem a bit
hypocritical, {or on “Relays Weekend"
there will also be a home track meet. a
home softball tournament, at home
baseball tournament. 3 home women's
soccer tournament. and a home rugby
tournament. This not only means that a
large portion or the student body will
not be able to participate in the games.
but also that once the sporting events
have ended. there will he a large
number oi people on campus who do not
attend the college. This can hardly be
expected to unity the student body. It
should also be noted that the Relays
committee was made aware of these
{acts prior to the choosing oi the (late

. tor Relays.

other arguments for choosing the
weekend of April 27 were that that
weekend is also a prospective weekend
twhich will certainly help unity the stir
dent body . please note the sarcasm)
and that Dave McConnell rciuses to
have food service serve the traditional
post-Relays picnic dinner on the
weekend or May 4. However. alter
reading the comments printed in the
Scarlet and Black which pertain to the
quality of food service. it seems that
this would not bother a large portion of

the student body. I, for one. can honest»
ly say that my enioymeiit at last years
Relays would not have been lessened
If food service had not provided “5 Willi
that wonderful postltelays taco dinner.
One must also realize that. legally.
most or the prospectives will be unable
to participate in the games. lor they
\\ ill be younger than the tuna drinking
age, '
’ The weekend of May 4 was also re
jected because it is a trustees weekend.
However. it vioultl he ludicrous to
believe that the trustees think that
Gi'innell College students neither drink
nor have the need “lo vent some
academic steam ' Tllus. except [or the
tact that food serv e will not cater din-
ner. having Relays the weekend oi May
4 should be acceptable to most of the
student body,
in light of the above mentioned lacts.
the Relays committee should either
consider changing the date ot
'. distributing hundreds of guest
passes for the event - at least 100 to
visiting rugby players alone. or chang
ing their deieiise ol why Relays should
not be abolished, — lliivid Klainlnli
