costumes are authentic right down to
the light switches and buttons.

In the film iher first Academy Award
Vtas for Norma Rael. Places in the
Heart offered Field another role as a
strong woman. the type or role Field
has had a hard time receiving since her
days as the iiying nun.

John Malkovich. one of Broadway's
brightest stars. was excellent as the
boarder, Malkovich and his first two
screen roles in 1534 in Places in the
Heart and The Killing Fields and for-
tunately does as well on the screen as

8% is an Intalian film which won the
best foreign film of 1963. The ﬁlm is
Fellini's masterpiece and one of his
most personal works.

8V: is the fullest expression of the sub-
jects. themes and preoccupations of
Fellini's career. The title is indicative
of the film's personal nature. Fellini
had made seven features and two
episodes making xl/z his eighth and a
half work.

The film is a Visual diary in which
Fellini depicts the movie director's dif-
ficulties in making the very film the
viewer is watching. iii/p gives the viewer
a complex view of Fellini’s memories.
feelings and personal life.

Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido, a
forty-three year old director. and San-
di-a Milo is his plump. stupid mistress.
Anouk Aimme portrays Guido's cool.
unsensual wife.

The style of 8V: is extravagant. Both
dreams and reality are so bizarre that
it is difficult to tell them apart. The ex-
pressionistic dreamlike atmosphere is
enhanced by the sets. costumes,
photography, and the musical score
