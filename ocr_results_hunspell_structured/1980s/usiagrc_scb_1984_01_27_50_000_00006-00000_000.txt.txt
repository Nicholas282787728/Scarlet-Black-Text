The Black Light Theatre brings
their highly-acclaimed touring
company to Grinnell tor a perlor-
mance in Roberts Theatre, Tues
day, Jan. 31 at a pm.

The Black Light Theatre is an 13
member ensemble, originally
formed in 1961 in Prague,
Czechoslovakia by Jiri Srnec,
presently artistic director of the
group.

Black Light combines pan-
tomlme, dance, puppetry and
music with an intriguing
theatrical technique known as
“black cabinet ” In this technique
the actors are clothed in black
from head to loot and perlorm in
front of a black background,
manipulating objects such as
over-sized dice, puppets, and

other assorted objects so that the
objects appear to move on their
own accord.

Srnec does not use this Visual ef~
fect merely as a stunt; rather, the
‘levitating' objects play integral
roles in the story being told. Live
performers, in lull view or the air
dience, also take part in the per-
formance.

The entire production is enhanc-
ed by the “black light’ eitect,
which gives an “irridescent ran
diance" to the props and lends
highlights to the live periormers.
The music score follows the action
and enhances the effects ol the
performers, both visible and in
visible.

One of Black Light‘s most re-
cent efforts is the production enr
titled “A Week of Dreams." In
“Dreams" Black Light uses their
innovative theatrics to present the
story of a taxi-driver, who traffics
an odd assortment of characters
to their destinations during the
week.

on each day, one particular
passenger is the object of his
nightly dream, as a result of leav~
ing some object in his taxi or
through some unusual contact or
impression, Black light leads its
audience through these momen-
tary, bizzare dream worlds in a
style that showcases their unique
creative genius.

Black Light has toured exten-
sively since its inception, and has
garnered praise trom theatre
critics in locales as tar-flung as
Edinburgh, Perth, Dublin, and
Houston. One critic wrote. “This
fabulous theatre must now be ac-
cepted into the iamily of major
drama."

In between the films and ther-
monuclear symposiums, Grin
nellians will have the opportunity
to experience Black Light and see

‘Emserbead’ will

s/aloc/e your senses

by Scott Sutherland

What do Henry Spencer, Mary x, The Women Across The Hall, The
Lady In The Radiator, and the strangest little baby you've ever seen
have in common? Quite simply, they‘re all characters in the semi
shlock, ultrabizzarro cult sensation illm "Eraserhead," (90 min )show-
ing in South Lounge at 9:30 pm Friday and 7:30 p.m. Saturday.

“Eraserhead,” a highly experimental picture iilmed on a shoe-string
budget in 1977 and directed by David (“Elephant Man") Lynch, stars
John Nance as the catatonic Henry who bumbles through this sometimes
mirthiul‘ often macabre film, his eyes wide with wonder at the terrifying
world in which he lives.

Henry's world, a surreal combination oi horriiic reality and his own
fantastic dreams, is set against the grim backdrop oi a stark, grey,
American industrial city. “Eraserhead”, filmed in black-and-white, con-
veys with startling ettectiveness tbut not without humor) the sense oi
acute alienation that plagues all the characters,

This alienation ultimately drives Henry out of "reality" (such as it is
in‘ Ei‘aserhead") and into the world 01‘ his dreams, most notably into the
imagined( '3) arms of The Lady In The Radiator. a disturbing creature

“Eraserhead” is the brooding, nightmarish story at the mistit Henry
(whose \V|ld hair resembles the irazzled business—end or a used Qrtip),
his spactic girliriend Mary x, and their half-human baby, The
monstrous iniant is depicted with graphic clarity, as are all the repulsive
scenes land there are more than a iewi throughout the lilin.

Mingled with Henry's bizzarre domestic lite, which includes caring for
the baby when it becomes ill and an incredible chickenrdmner scene at
Mary‘s house, are his wild dreams. One dream has Henry losing his head
by decapitation, and in a humorous scene the head is used as eraser Iod-
der in a pencil factory (hence the inlet

while “Eraserhead” is not in the least a happy or enlightening Iilm it
is nonetheless provocative for its symbolic, surreal treatment at the
mundane elements in everyday life And though it uses humor to some
extend to get its story across, it is the pervasive sense oi horror in
“Eraserhead” that lends the him its ability to shock.
