uld share some thoughts with you on be
a polltical science major The worst
blem there is in being a political
ence major is everyone assumes you
s going to be a lawyer. Fortunately, not
political science majors want to go to
school. In fact, the political science
fessors recommend that those in-
ested in attending law school would be
ter served with a major in physics.

read me, but at least it is a step in
pelling the stereotype oi the political
ence major as a Paper Chase Hunky.
he second biggest problem political
ence majors have to deal with is
inomics majors. Political science tries
explain how people behave in the real
rld lany place outside of Grinnell exs
at Cambridge, Mass). Economics on
other hand, as a science, functions in
realm of Never Never Land. You see,
-nomisls, while trying to explain
nomena in their iantasyland, assume
atcvcr postulate looks plausible at the
e and suits their current needs. then
y build their theories upon those
~umptions, justifying their iairy tales

t-ations at which they cannot even agree
on among themselves. The result of all

science majors We political scientists at
tribute their actions to insecurity and
jealousy over the tact that more people
understand politics than understand
economics,

As I mentioned earlier, political science
tries to explain how people behave,
politically, in the real world This is essen-
tially true, but there is another branch 01
political science that studics other forms
of government and tries to think of other
ways in which people can govern
themselves. This area is called political
philosophy and some at the more lamous
political philosophers are: Plalo, Thomas
Hobbes and James Madison.

James Madison, as you may or may not
know, practically invented the United
States on his own and because of him many
political scientists have iound employ
ment. American politics is a fascinating
subject and thousands of political scien
tists have analyzed, explained and tried to
change our political system. The invention
or the public opinion poll was the biggest
thing tohit politicalscience since theparty
convention. Since the introduction of the
opinion poll, political scientists have cone
ducted thousands of polls in order to be
able to classify the American voter into
neat little categories. They then try to
predict how these voters will respond to

measured by how well we display our con-
cern, but by how much money we raise.

All this said and done, I hope students
understand Uiat our lax sarcasm does not
characterize our deep ielt concern for
Salvadoran Refugees. I ask Tim and
others to determine who really is getting

To the Editor:

We recently attended the Ubii plays and
were appalled at the blatant amount of
musical plagerism. Throughout Ubn,
whole verses and tunes appeared to be
directly lifted from the musical Hair. The
lines, “I love you but it embarrasses me to
walk down the street with him.” from
Green Candle “by" Rich Grinker. is
directly copied irom “Frank Mills" by
Gerome Ragni, James Rado and Galt
Macdei'mot in Hair. Also, the Palcontent's
tune is palniully similar to the tune or
“Black Boys/White Boys."

We are not aware of the legal procedures
concerning such matters but, as Grinnell
College students, we realize the imporr
tance of citing sources and nothing was
mentioned in the Ubu program. As
freshmen, we were made well aware of the
fact that plagerism is no laughing matter.
According to the Student Handbook, on
page 16:

A student is expected to
acknowledge explicitly any expres-
sions, ideas or observations which
are not his or her own, . . Even when
there may be no conscious eitort to
deceive, failure to make appropriate
acknowledgement may constitute
plagerism.

To our understanding, rehearsals tor
Ubu have gone on for quite a while and we
are surprised that none of the profes-
sionals involved did not double check the
authorship or Mr. Grinker's work. 7 Sign-

vote, how they Will vote and so on and so
iorth. The problem political scientists run
into is the fact that people are not static.
By the time the results [rain the polls
taken after one election are known, the
next election IS over and the results are
useless as a torecasting devise tor the lat»
terglection The process then begins all
over again. yet the ballot box remains one
step ahead of the political scientists' at
tempts to predict how people will cast their
votes. it is all very irustrating (the pro.
lessor who specializes in this area at Grins
hall has very little hair left) but some
trends are discernible, albeit too late [or
practical use.

While some political scientists try to
tigure out the American voter, others are
busy analyzing America's relations with
other nations, Basically, this type of
analysis consists or an examination ot the
decisions made in the past concerning
foreign policy and classifying those deci»
sions into categories so that all foreign
policy decisions can be analyzed as one or
another “decision making process."

As we all know, the governmeni is a
bureaucracy divided into little
bureaucracies, hence, any foreign policy
decision made by the United States is go-
ing to he made by one or more
bureaucraCles~usually the latter, The

sion making process. the harder that deCl~
sion becomes to analyze. One might even
argue that it is impossible {or anyone oulr
side the bureaucracy to explain what goes
on inside the bureaucracy when those on
the inside of the bureaucracy and the decir
sion making process do not even know
themselves' An astute observer might
point out that this type of political science
is useless since the policy enacted is
history and the ramifications brought
about are already known and not much can
be done about it, True, but we must study
history or we are doomed to repeat it. . or

Dear Jean Frazer:

we, the members or the student Govern-tent Ass

a!" 50112

~sticn. do hereby

request that you resign from either yo pnsi an as Jean of the
7 ulty or as a tenured member of the Department of Philosophy.

Your recent conduct has convinced us that you are either incapable
or unwilling to distinguish between your roles as administrator and
professor. lle refer specifically to the inf1u=nce you exerted
when Dan Magul'shak was reviewed for and subse mi‘Jy denied tenure
bysthe Executive council. one of the criteria .he council con—

sidered Wis job description.

That is, you and the other members

discussed whether or not its. lllagursiiak's areas :2‘ specialization,
phenomenology and Existentialism, are appropriate subjects to be '
taught at Grinnell College. But the guidelines or the Executive

Council implicitly prohibit the discussion of job description dur-

ing review tor tenure.

you ’expx‘essed your doubts regarding the appraA

mrthemore. as a neuter cf ,the council

areness of phenom—

enology and existentiallsm in the Grinnell D partnent of Philosophy.
We believe that you have exploited your uhus a1 position as both
Dean and philosophy proressor to remove two subject areas train

35 curriculum. we are outraged that you would 'iake this decision
on the bass: of your own personal taste as to ‘Nha‘. should and

should not be taught.

cur- request {or your resignation stems tron on: concern not: only
about this injustice but from the real possibility of mtura ones.
Dari nagur-shak's posltioh will have to be filled. As the situation
had stands, you could have an inordinate aeaunt or say as to who
will be hired and what his or her area or specialization is in.

we do not feel that you have behaved in a manner which entltles you

to these privileges.

Respectfully Submitted.
