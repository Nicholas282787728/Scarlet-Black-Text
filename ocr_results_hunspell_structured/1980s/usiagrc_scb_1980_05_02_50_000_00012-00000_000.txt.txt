The chaos of capitalism

> Man is a social animal who thrives
on personal interaction with others.
This is basic to human nature. The
ego gains its greatest affirmation
through the acknowledgment of
others. This sort of public allirmation
can take many lDX‘mS, including will to
power, love and compassion. Greed,
therefore, can be seen as the ego’s at»
tempt to display its worth or power to
others.

In the capitalist system, it is assum-
ed that greed is the basic operating
human drive. Capitalism is a system
oi power economics. Free enterprise
means survival of the ﬁttest. In other
words, in a system based on limited
capital, il' l possess more than my
share someone else must possess less.
Captialism is a dynamic system based
on inequality. This situation has been
further inflamed by the development
of» the corporate giant, which reduces
the number of potential compotitve
sources effectively operating in the
market place. This is why capitalism
is in crisis today. Economic growth
cannot be maintained forever, Ines
quality can only be tolerated tor so
long.

~The nation-state has emerged
alongside capitalism. They are both
associated with the same historical
phenomenon: econoniicrpolitical er
pansionism and the dis lacement oi
the feudal aristocracy y the middle
class. The state ultimately maintains
its interests by the use oi coercive
powers, i.e,, its laws, customs, police
force, etc. Neither are State interests
always analogous to popular will. Any
nation based on a classoriented
capitalisticrbased economic structure
will have an economico-political elite
who will possess an inordinate amount
of state power.

in a tree society, the state will
usually tolerate limited dissent among

its citizens, and will iavor nonviolent
means of coercion such as the use oi
the press, educational system, public
pressure, and law to maintain order
and gain public compliance to state in
terests. Nevertheless, behind all this
‘liberality' is still the stick of the
despot.

This emphasis on coercion in our
society is neither healthy nor iair.
Despite the humanitarianism or our
Judeanhristian heritage, the underly-
ing lesson that modern society teaches
us is that might makes right. This
tendency seems to be being entorced
today in the newly emerging
Totalitarian Communist States.
Although Marxist thought assumes the
basic goodness at human nature,
although it assumes that (following a
period oi proletariat or ‘peoples' d'
tatorship) man is capable of maintain
ing an egalitarian state, and although
Chinese Communism emphasizes the
desire of the individual to become
socialized, the basic mechanism for
determining and promoting social
goals still remains the state's coercive
powers.

Human nature is a mix of many
characteristics beyond greed and will
to power, including altruism, compas-
sion, and love. in our present society,
these aspects of human nature have
been sadly de—emphasired. in a socie-
ty in which the individual is complete-
ly inundated ll'ol'n birth with coercive
pressures and a continual association
oi power and goodness, the result is a
powerroriented conditioned response.
By removing the state, you remove
this psychological pressure on the in-
dividual, and allow the other aspects
oi his nature to be more tully
developed.

In an anarchistic society, state coerr
cion would no longer remain. Certain

perfect, It could never be completely
egalitarian or tree from coercion,
However, coercion would be less pro
nounced and less destructive then it is
today. The societal power-drive in
herent in state mechanisms would be
absent. The individual would be
responsible to himseli and others
through himself.

An anarchistic society would not be
the same thing as a chaotic society.
Man is a social animal. With or
without a State superstructure, he
must still find some means of we
cessfully interacting with others. A
sense of community based on common
aiiinity Would remain once the state
was removed. ‘

Chaos need not be sought after in an
anarchistic society. One need only
look at the unbelievable tensions of
our modern world to see individuals
and nations possessing unimaginable
destructive capabilities and at each
other's throats and to see individuals
and nations lunctioning merely to pro-
mote private interests. One need not
look Very far to ﬁnd a chaotic world,
because it is with us today.
