Scarlet and Black

or

Participation, Education
Keys to Ending Apartheid

Carol Pilgrim and Rebecca Weston

When an individual is no longer a
true participant, when [5/] he no
longer feels a sense of responsibilir
ty to his l/her] society, the Content
of democracy is emptied When
culture is degraded and vulgarity
enthroned. when the social system
does not build security but induces
peril, inexorably the individual is
impelled to pull away from a
soulless society. (Rev, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr, Trumpet or Colis-
cience, 44).

On March so, 1960, the African
National Congress must, a major
force behind the Black Liberation
Movement in South Africa under
the leadership of Nobel Peace
Prize Winner Chief Albert Luthuli,
was banned under the pretext of
protecting law and order, and
maintaining ‘peaceful relations
between the many racial groups’ in
South Africa. This ban was only
one aspect of the repression impose
ed by the concurrent State oi
Emergencv

Far from maintaining peace and
justice tthough it further reiiied
the ‘law‘i. this ban closed many
channels for nonviolent resistance
previously available and used by
the ANC. The ANC subsequently
was driven underground and has
since been torced to turn to cons
trolled, violent means of protest.

In June 1986, another State of
Emergency was declared, and it is
still in effect

On February 24, 1988 — two
weeks ago. the United Democratic
Front (UDFl, founded by Rev.
Alan Bocsak in 1983 in order to
unify and expand upon the non-
violent resistance movement was
banned. Additionally, the Congress
of South African Trade Unions
tCOSATUl, an organization that
has increasingly become a major
force behind organized, nonviolent
and legal resistance, was banned
from all political activity. Current
legislation in parliament is pen-
ding that would make all labor
Strikes illegal, Furthermore, 16
other prominent black anti~
apartheid organizations (including
those that unity and support
parents of detained childrent were
also banned.

In the words of Adriaan Vlok.
”Law and Order Minister," these
bannings are necessary in order to
“Contribute to a climate of stabili~
ty, peaceful coexistence and good
neighborliness among all popula-
tion groups” (Washington Post,
2/25/88, p34A). in our view, the
bans are a desperate attempt by
Pieter Botha and his Nationalist

Party to salvage his eroding sup-
port among conservative whites
who fear and resist even Botha’s
superficial and deceptive reforms.
Once again, Pretoria has
systematically closed off all chan-
nels for nonviolent protest and at
the same time. out off all
possibilities for nonviolent reform
and negotiation With the legitimate
black leaders.

On February 29, Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and Rev Alan
Boesak (also President of the
World Alliance of Reformed Chur-
ches) were among 150
demonstrators arrested [or mars
ching in protest of the bannings.
Both have maintained that the
“government's actions will drive
more antirapartheid activists
underground and leave them with
violence as the only available ops
tion" (Washington Post, 2/25/38,
p34A).

Among those also arrested in the
protest were cas news reporters
who were trying to cover the pros
test, That the press was arrested is
indicative of a serious problem:
The South African-imposed censor
ship of the press. Until the most re-
cent news splasli, Botha has sues
ceeded in keeping the racist, ops
pressive, and inherently Violent
apartheid laws out of the
headlines, thus allowing the inter-
national community to claim ig-
norance and wallow in complacenr
cy.
When “information" does get out
of South Africa, Botha designs the
news releases in such a way to lead
the international community to the
irrational and inconceivable Con-
clusion that the only violence tak
ing place in South Africa is on the
part of the Blacks. According to
the AfricanrAmerican Institute in
a report published in 1987, “the
new emergency regulations ..
are indirectly at the press- it is diir
iicult now to get anywhere near the
unrest and therefore virtually imr
possible to give a correct picture of
what is happening in South
Africa."

We applaud the international
press for its recent coverage of
South Africa; we only wish that
coverage would and could be more
consistent and less distorted. In
fact, South Africa's return to the
headlines has helped rejuvenate
the surge or public outrage which
was subdued during the press ban.

pressed outrage on the bans on pro
tests” iDcs Moiiies Register,
2/26/88, DSAJ The bannings even
managed to elicit a response from
Reagan and Thatcher who both
issued their strongest rhetorical
condemnation of Pretoria in their
public careers.

In Iowa, the. Senate State
Government Committee has
recently approved a bill under the
direction of Jean Lloyd-Jones (D)
which would require the state to
“divest itself of all investments in
companies doing business in South
Africa.” In explanation of this re
cent move, Lloyd-Jones stated that
two years ago, ”an exception [in
Iowa’s divestment policies] was
made for companies adhering to
the Sullivan Principles " However,
Lloyerones states that “the Prinr
ciples have not gone far enough to
correct Conditions in South Africa

It had an impact on the situa
tion, but it did not by itself bring
about change," The Des Moines
Register summed about Lloydr
Jones's argument by saying that
the “backers of divestment
therefore felt it was time to take
another step" (Des Moines
Register, 3/3/38, pZAl,

Our support tor these measures
is qualified only by the recognition
that stronger measures need to be
taken by the United States and the
rest of the international communlr
ty, The Board of Trustees at Grin-
nell College is unwilling to, even as
far as total divestment.

As students, we must participate
in the anti-apartheid movement as
much as We can in our academic
community. We must attend the
upcoming symposium on South
African politics and the resistance
movement this April 4-7; we must
attend “Cry Freedom" (albeit
with a Critical eye) that will be
showing at the Grinnell Cinema
this April 814; we must attend the
movies about the apartheid system
and liberation movements currents
ly being shown in South Lounge
and ARI-I, and we must assist black
South African students obtain a
higher education by buying baked
goods, buttons, and Trshirts in the
post office every Friday morning.
Not only are these forms of action
important in their own right,
unified and consistent student
commitment to anti-apartheid et-
forts will give ”Students to End
Apartheid” credibility and
strength from which to demand
total divestment. The trustees will
not do it alone We must par-
ticipate — the struggle must
become an international one.

Freedom

of the

Press Brings
Responsibility

John Newmark

Today I have a surprise tor
everyone, lam happy. lam glad. I
have hope for the future of
America. However, i will admit
that my glee is tempered a little
with caution. I will get to thatlatcr,
but first, the cause of my hapr
piness: Rev. Jerry Falwell did not
win his libel case against Larry
Flynl, publisher of Hustler
magazine. The Supreme Court
voted unanimously. There was no
dissenting opinion. The story
began when Hustler magazine in
cluded a parody of some ads
published by Campari Liqueur. In
the Campari Liqueur ads, promir
nent figures were shown recalling
“the iirst time" they had ever
tasted Canlpari. Hustler decided to
run a parody describing “the iirst
time” Rev. Jerry Falwell had sex-
ual intercourse According to
Hustler. it was “during a drunken,
incestuous rendezvous with his
mother in an outhouse."_ln ex-
tremely tiny type at the bottom of
the page, Hustler magazine had
printed, “Fictio - Ad and For»
sonality Parody "

Falwell sued the magazine for
invasion oi privacy, willful and
malicious libel, and intentional ine
iliction of emotional distress.
Before the case even reached the
Supreme Court, the charge oiinva-
sion of privacy was dismissed It
was also decided that hustler
hadn't committed libel, becausc
the parody "Could not reasonably
be understood as describing actual
facts or events.” In other words.
the parody was obviously a parody
and no one could realistically
believe it was anything but a
parody. However, Falwell was
originally awarded $200,000 for
emotional distress This compen-
sation was overturned unanimous
ly by the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court reasoned
that if they awarded Falwell the
money, a flood of cases would
follow from emotionally distress-
ed' public figures. The right to
criticize authority and public
figures had to be maintained. 1
agree that Falwell should receive
no money, it what Hustler commit
ted was not libel; however, I am
surprised that the supreme Court
unanimously decided it wasn't.
Libel is defined as any untrue
statement, written with a
malicious intent to harm. l realize
malicious intent is difficult to pro
ve, but it is surprising that the

use staeairexwamie

Supreme Court was unanimous
with this case. especially Consider-
ing the conservative leanings of
many oi the members. in one
sense, i am happy. This is a victory
for freedom of the press, However,
as columnist James Kirkpatrick
said recently, “It was a Pyrrhic
victory,"

Putting aside the [act that
Hustler is a pornographic
magazine, since that has little to do
with the case, the parody could
easily have been construed as say»
ing that Falwell has at least the
personality of a person who would
Commit incest, even if he never ac-
tually did it, It depends on how one
translates the phrase, “personality
parody," which appeared on the
bottom of the magazine page. And
while there is some understanr
dable humor in the parody of the lie
queur ad, the criticism of Falwell.
which is probably more apparent
to the average reader of Hustler
magazine, doesn’t appear to have
much purpose other than to attack
Falwell’s personality. I guess one
could claim it was supposed to be a
parody on the recent problems
various television ministries have
been having; however, if this was
the case, Swaggart or Bakker
would have been more appropriate
ministers to use. i don't think any
similar accusations had been
made about Falwell until Hustler
arrived on the stands.

I'm not sure how I would judge
the case, but I can envision a
strong argument {or the prosecu
tion, as well as the defense,
Freedom of the press is important,
but how much freedom should the
press have? was Larry Flynl
allowed to get away with libel. in
order to preserve the freedom of
the press for everyone else'! The
Constitution tells us it is better to
allow to guilty men to go free than
it is to allow one innocent man to be
punished, but if Flynt committed
libel, there had to have been a way
the Supreme Court could have
declared him guilty without opens
ing the courts to “emotional
distress' suits. I guess I should look
on the bright side. A Pyrrhic vic~
tory is still a victory. The fact that
the Supreme Court, even with a
conservative majority. even with
all the chairs filled, still voted
unanimously for the rights of the
press is heartening. But the ques-
tions remain, Has the press been
given too much power, and can
they handle it?
