Nov. H. 1986

by Shelley Reid

Among the changes wrought in me by
living in London is a new appreciation tor
ANY food, including Quad’s End—otthe-
Semester Goulash, because like most of
the people arriving in London, I was
basically a novice when it came to cooking
regular meals.

1 practiced a bit over the summer. You
put the potatoes in the microwave, try the
meatballs in the electric skillet, and dump
a bag ot Birdseye Frozen Mixed
Vegetables into boiling water on the stove
7 no problem. I was aware that my budget
in London would restrict the size and quali-
ty of my kitchen, but “a Grinnell student
can adapt." i thought.

Never in my most Bohemian dreams did
I imagine a kitchen like the one we ended
up with. I was prepared to work in a kite
chen without a microwave or a food pro-
cessor. l was not expecting a dishwasher
or an electric wok. By now, I’ve even got»
ten to the point where the huge orange and
yellow {lowered window shades don't
bother me (much).

But I should have known we were in trou-
ble when we had to begin by tnrowmg out
three knives that couldn’t Cut a decent
slice OI cheese and a potato peeler that had

Way Out in London

Cooking is less than meets the eye

been around as long as Joan Collins. As the
tirst weeks went by, we accumulated quite
a list of utensils that no kitchen could at»
tord to be without:

Measuring Cup and spoons: how
can you have a kitchen without
measuring spoons? Especially con
sidering our lack of expertise, these
were essential, When one is dealing
with a substance as potentially
volatile as British chili powder, a
slight miscalculation can ruin an
otherwise delightiul meal.

A casserole dish or cake pan: own-
ing at least one of these can make
life much easier and less
monotonous. You may not be a big
fan of tuna casserole, but endless
meals of soup or quiche (we do have
saucepans and a small glass pie
dish) tend to get a bit boring,

A strainer: this item seems unims
portant until you realize that pasta is
a main staple of any lowrbudget, no,
frills menu It IS possible to drain all
the water out of a pan of pasta by
holding the lid slightly ajar, but
about the third time your hand slips

and a whole pan or spaghetti spnls
out into the sink (which is usually
filled with dirty breakfast dishes).
The eXCltement of this method
begins to fade.

The crowning non-achievement of our
kitchen, however, is our gas oven. We
iinally discovered, atter several attempts
to gas ourselves out oi the tlat, the oven
cannot be lit via the pilot light in the lront.
One must light the oven by holding a
match over the main heating element in
the back. hoping that the names do not
burst out with too much vigor and set one’s
arm on fire

Since the oven is on and lit and set at the
right gas mark, it is easy to make the
mistake of assuming that it will heat up.
We have come to the conclusion that our
oven has essentially one temperature: Not
Hot Enough.

We began to get a hint when a recipe
calling [or 45 minutes cooking time took an
hour. Our suspicions were further confirm»
ed when a pot or thinly sliced potatoes sat
in the oven for an hour and a half and Came
out (when we were tinally too hungry to
wait any longer) still pleasantly crunchy.

But the real failure was the night we

decided to make chocolate chip cookies as
a study break. Chocolate chips themselves
are almost non-existent in London. but we
were willing to make do with a choppedsup
Cadbury bar.

in high spirits, we preheated the oven,
mixed the batter, and put the ﬁrst batch in
the oven. They were ALMt", ST done when
we took them out thirtysiive mintues later;
we were upset when midnight rolled
around and we were sltll waiting for the
last batch to cook s some study break.

There are moments when we swear that
we will never cook again as long as we live.
These oaths are never as easy to keep
when one is hungry and poor So we try to
look on the bright side. After all, we say as
we crunch our potatoes and rescue me
pasta from the sink, if we can cook in Lon-
don. we ought to be able to cook anywhere.
