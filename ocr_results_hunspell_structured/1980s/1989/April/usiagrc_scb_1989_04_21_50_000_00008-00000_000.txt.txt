Grinnell bank an architectural "jewel"

by Seth Peterson

The current symposium on
American architect Louis Sullir
van, which began yesterday and
continues through tomorrow,
Saturday, April 22, is cause for a
reconsideration of his work in
Grinncll. The Poweshick
Count 'onal Bank in Grin-
ncll, orginally tltc Merchants
National Bank, is one of Sulli-
van’s masterpieces.

As mentor of Frttnk Lloyd
Wright and “father of American
architecture," Sullivan is highly
regarded today as otle of the most
innovative American architects of
this century. The prevalent trend
towards pseudo-Roman or Greek
architecture in America around
the turn of the century caused
Sullivan's popularity to decline
drastically. Consequently, his
need for commissions took him
to several Midwestern states, in
eluding Minnesota, lndiana,
Ohio, and Wisconsin, as well as
Iowa. During the period span-
ning l9,06 to 1920, he designed
eight rural banks in the Midwest.
These banks are considered lnore
representative of Sullivan‘s
breadth of talent than many of his
earlier urban, commercial buildr
ings, Certain characteristics are
common to all of these banks:
decorative potychromy, texture
and a harmonious balance of or-
namcnt, structure. and propor-
tion. A furdter clement common
to these banks. as evidenced by
the bank in Grinnell is concern
for the contextual relationship
between the banks and their set-
tings.

Planning for the Brenton
bank began in 1913, and it was
officially opened on January 1,
1915. Originally named the
Merchants National Bank, the fir
nal cost totaled $60,000. It is
unknown exactly who brought
Sullivan to Grinnell, but legend
has it that he matte his prelimi-
nary drawings for the bank on
stationery he’d purcltased from a
drugstore on Broad Street. He
was commissioned to design the
new Grinnell bank on the site of
the old bank building, located at

what was then the main intersec-
tion in Grinnetl: Fourth and
Broad. , , _

ln accomplishing this task,
Sullivan successfully modified
his polychromatic and ornamental
techniques to a scale appropriate
for the bank’s setting. For this
reason, the Poweshlck bank is
popularly known as Sullivan’s
“jewel box.” He designed the
bank to fit harmoniously with
the neighboring buildings and the
general lownscape. As part of
this process, Sullivan clearly ob,
served and integrated patterns.
textures, and colors present in the
commercial structures in
proximity to the bank. The re
Suit is a unique expression de—
rived from the characteristics of
the buildings on Fourth Street
and the west side of Broad.

The bank’s rectangular shape
promotes balance with the sure
rounding structures and also con—
notes security and stability. The
ornamentation serves to temper
any sense of austerity implied by
its cubical shape. Sullivan skilr

coua and gilt. The rose window
contains patterns of reds, oranges,
and yellows with subtler hues of
green and blue, and the exterior
design consists of five layers of
geometric shapes: circles, a
square, and a diamond. The effect
is striking, with the symbolic
meaning of the design open for
speculation. Some critics assert
that Sullivan intended to create
the image of a “key," to symbol-
ize the locks on the Vault door
which prior to renovation were
on the same axis as the doorway,
directly inside. The brown terra-
cotta cornice along the top of the
bank is elaborately designed and
the protruding finials offer a con»
trast to the unobtrusive planes.
Two griffins perched on either
side of the doorway guard the one
trance.

The attention to detail exhib-
ited in the exterior ornamentation
is present throughout the interior.
Many of the geometric shapes of
the exterior appear in the reliefs
and windows within the bank.
The cast wall dominates with a
row of 10 exquisite stained—glass
windows with focal points come
posed of brilliant hues of blue
and green, inset behind oak
columns. The rear of the main
corridor is framed by a decorative
frieze which is of the same pat-
tcrrl as the exterior cornice. The
layout is foremost functional,
with natural illumination at a
premium. An immense cream»
andrbluc skylight fills the ceiling
of the main hall, but due to its
height is largely unnoticed. The
interior color scheme enhances

ttte natural golden ambiance:
hickoryrstaincd wood, verde an-
tique marble counter tops and
pinkish-gray marble floors.

The synthesis of geometric
forms with natural, botanical el-
ements is the basis for Sullivan’s
architecture and ornamentation.
As art historian Lauren Weingar-
den observes, Sullivan “believed
that by actually seeing these
symbolic forms the spectator
would be free to realize his or her
identity with the infinite Creative
Spirit and, then, contribute to the
moral, physical, and spititual ad-
vance of society at large.“ In this
regard, Sullivan‘s architectural
philosophy was both
transcendental and democratic.

The Poweshiek bank is at the
very least an expression of
exceptional creative and technical
talent. Various writers, in re-
viewing this work, have specur
lated as to Sullivan’s source of
creative inspiration. One writer
described Sullivan as “the man
who drew the designs of the Ara»
bian Nights, Arabian Days and
the Tales of Persian
Fireworshippcrs until it worked
like hasheesh and the subcon-
scious mind took control and
saw, in a vision, the complete
semblence of the thing that was
to be.“ The writer continues:
“Shutting himself up almost
without food, he concentrates eve
ery thought upon his work as
zealously as a Buddhist priest
sinks his identity in the larger
thought of Nirvana." Sullivan did
have an essential, metaphysical
philosophy that he applied to his
designs, which at its most basic
level was “form follows funcv
tion.” However, it is important
to note that as a realist and an
individual with a regard for his-
tory, Sullivan’s artistic expres»
sion is the culmination of mate»
rials and vision combined with
principles of form already
historically established. Further,
he realized that his continued
employment, particularly in rural
America, depended foremost on
his technological and practical
excellence rather than his divinely
inspired vision. All are encour-
aged to take notice of this mar»
velous embodiment of composi-
tional integrity and creative ge-
mous.
