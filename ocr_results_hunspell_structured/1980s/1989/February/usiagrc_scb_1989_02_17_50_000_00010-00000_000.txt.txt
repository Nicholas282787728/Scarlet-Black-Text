Proposition 42
Continued from Page 12

complaints, the NCAA reversed
their decision and in turn
established a fresh program.
Dubbed “Proposition 48,” the
new rule held that incoming
freshmen who had the 2.0 GPA
but failed to meet the college
boards requirements were still
eligible for a scholarship but
would be forced to sit out their
entire freshman season. These
partial qualifiers would thus have
three years of varsity eligibility
remaining, provided, of course,
they made their grades their first
year. This compromise has
permitted a myriad of extremely
talented athletes to follow their
dreams of attending college and
playing Division-l ball.

The recent amendment to
Prop. 48, “Proposition 42." has
placed fresh wood on a once-
dormanl fire. Reinslituting the
previously disbanded 1985
eligibility requirements,
Proposition 42. which is set to
go into effect in August 1990,
has provoked unprecedented
unrest in the college community.

Leading the ﬁght against this
racist rule is John Thompson,
head basketball coach for the
Georgetown University Hoyas.
Thompson, who coached the
US. Men‘s Olympic Team to a
bronze medal in Seoul. protested
the amendment by walking off
the coun just prior to the onset
of several of his team's recent
games. Carried nationwide by
the media, this protest has stirred
a great deal of public support for
Thompson and against
Proposition 42.

Once an underprivileged black
youth himself, Thompson vehe-
mently protests the rule on the
grounds that it discriminates
against minority student athletes
who depend on scholarships as a
means (often the only means) to
enter college The new
requirements, claims Thompson,
will prevent many poverty-
stricken youngsters from ever
winning scholarships.

Thompson further asserts that
the rule is hypocritical in that it
ignores other troubled facets of
collegiate athletics. Rather than
curbing the winvat~any-cost
mentality, namely the prevalence
of grade-fixing and the
preferential treatment for star
athletes, Proposition 42 will
actually enhance its likelihood.
Boosters of major universities
will have an even greater
incentive to bend the rules in
order to get the bluevchip recruit
on the court.

In addition, it remains to be
Seen whether Proposition 42 will
serve as a remedy for the
ridiculously low (on average)
graduation rate for student
athletes in Division-I sports,
which is undoubtedly the rule’s
intended meaning. The NCAA
attempted to adopt a quick
solution to the age-old problem
of the low graduation rate

amongst athletes. What better
way, they erroneously concluded,
than to raise entrance
rcquirer'nans.

A widely held alternative to
Proposition 427a measure
designed primarily to enhance the
academic aspect of major college
athletics while not discriminating
against a specific segment of the
populationiis to return to the
days of no freshman eligibility.
While by no means a longetenn
solution (if one even exists) to
this pressing problem, it is a step
in the right direction, especially
when compared with Proposition
42, which is reversing the entire
process.

What seems to be a recurrent
problem in Division-l athletics is
the vast array of difficulties
which stem from college
freshmen being in a completely
new environment, Fresh out of
high school and dropped into the
spotlight, many of these young-
sters never receive an opportunity
to get fully acclimated to their
new surroundings.

Eliminating freshmen
eligibility will allow the students
to get accustomed to college life
without the daily pressures of’
playing college ballr As it stands
now. they're never really given
the opportunity to be a student.
The moment they set foot on
campus, they‘re the "athlete."
This alternative will allow them
more time to apply themselves to

academics, which will ease the
transition in their sophomore
year when they’re permitted to
play.

Proposition 42 is clearly not
the answer. Prohibiting
underprivileged minorities from
entering college is more likely to
compound the problem by
increasing teenage unemployment
and gang-related violence than
serving as a remedy of any sort.

Everyone deserves an
opportunity to go to college.
Proposition 42 erases this
possibility.

The longstanding motto of
this country has been: “Land of
Opportunity." With the
institution of Proposition 42, it
should be revised to: 'thnd of

 

Buddha leave rest of

Last weekend the men’s swim
team went to Coe for the State
Small College Meet and emerged
with the championship for the
llth straight time. Scoring 133
points, our swimmers
outdisianced their closest
competition, Loras, by 64
points. When you‘re good,
you’regood.

Coach Obcrmillcr was pleased
with the meet, particularly
because the Pioneers have a
history of letting down at this
stage in the season. Further,
Grinnell was shorthanded,
because several swimmmers were
out due to illness. Nevertheless.
the team remained strong, which
can be attributed to its great
depth.

The Buddhas had a wide array
of individual standouts. Peyton
Engel once again had a good
outing, winning the 1000 free
and tying for first in the 500 free.
Joe Zimsen turned in a fine
performance as well, capturing

the 200 IM. Tom Smith
meanwhile came in a close
second in the 200 breaststroke.
John Williams was a major
contributor to the team win,
placing first in the 100 and 200
free. Williams was also part of
the winning 400 free relay team,
joined by Zimsen, Leonard
Murrin, and Scot Potts,

Many others turned in great
performances of their own. Jason
Martin swam his best three times
ever in all three events in which
he was entered, Dave Troy, Joe
Lewis, Eric Sandcen, Paul
Froesc, and Tom Nelson all had
exceptional times.

This. weekend the Pioneers
host the Buddha invitational.
Coach Obermillcr foresees some
experimentation as the final
conference choices are made. The
meet starts at 10 am on
Saturday. Come and cheer on the
swimmers as they prepare for
conference.

This interlude served as an
appropriate precursor for the
second-half excitement. After
playing catch-up ball for 15
minutes, the Pioneers took the
lead 51-60 on a Jacobson tum-
aroundjurnper.

With 1:22 on the clock,
Grinnell was up by a tenuous
point, 63-62, and in possession
of the basketball. The Pioneers
failed to convert, however, as
their shot bounced in and out.
Cornell capitalized on this golden
opportunity, canning a three-
pointer with :37 remaining.

Well, no one will say
Grinnell didn’t have their
chances In that ﬁnal half-minute
they had four shots at the victory
but came up empty.

Assessing the hard»fought
contest, Westlund had these
words: “Our guys came out in tile
second half and played good, solid
basketball. We put ourselves in
a position to win, which is our
number-one goal each and every
game. He added, "Everyone who
was called upon played very
well.“

conference

Last Saturday, the Grinnell
women‘s track team placed fourth
out of six team. in the south
division meet. Coach Evelyn
Freeman did not appear overly
concerned with her squad‘s
showing, noting that most teams
have trained longer. She said,
“We‘re learning about our
capabilities and developing
ourselves."

Top performances were turned
in by Abby Green, who won the
high jutnp at five feet and ran on
the Pioneer‘s third-place 4x200
relay team along with Manali
Barua, Kate Peterson and Sara
Conner,

The mile relay team of
Joanne Sackelt, Anne Papero,
Anne Holister, and Barb Duffrin
placed second. Sackett also won
the 600M dash with a time of
1:45.96. Duffrin placed fifth in
the long jump and 55M hurdles
while Hollister finished second in
the latter.

The men’s team didn't fair
quite as well in the meet, mainly
due to the fact that Coach Will
Freeman had only a few members
compete. The Pioneers finished
last in the south division contest.

Jonathon Lave led the team
with second-place finishes in the
1500M and 500Mi Dave
Peterson's fourth-place showing,
in the 600M represented the
Pioneers only other top
performance. ‘

Freeman has his guys
pointing toward the Midwest
Conference meet on March 3-4.
Both teams will compete
tomorrow at the University of
Northern Iowa
