Picasso and Matisse Seen On Campus

Where would you go in Iowa to
see the works of Picasso, Matisse,
Renoir, Rodin, Rembrandt. Salva-
dor Dali, Marc Chagall and Alexan»
der Calder?

To the basement of Burling Lia
brary,hometoGrinnell'spcrmanent
art collection.

The collection sits in a vault be-
hind the Print and Drawing Study
Room and contains~unbeknownst
to most Grinncll students — works
by the artists named above, not to
mention Diego Rivera,Frank Stella,
Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.

Though mostofthecollection stays
in storage, used mostly by students
and professors studying thepieces in
connection with a class, anyone can
requestto see any of theworks on the
spor.

Kay Wilson, registrar of the £01-
lection, said that its strength lies in
the 1,500 prints and drawings that
make up its bulk. Notable among the
works on paper is the college’s col-
lection of Eastern European and
Russian art, which Wilson said is
unusual more for its very existence
here than for its size. The college has
about 25 works by Soviet artist
Aleksandr Kalugin — the largest
collection of Kalugin‘s works in the

country.

Also notable are the hundreds of
pieces of African art, and the colv
lege’scollcctionsofltalianart,which
includes almost all the works of
eighteenth-century artist Giambat-
tistaPiianesi,WiIsonsaid.Theworks
were the gift of Marjorie Murphy
and Elizabeth Carter.

Thecollcction alsoincludesasmall
group of paintings, the best of which
are on display in Grinnell House and
Meats Cottage. Many of the paint-
ings are in poor condition, Wilson
said,andperhapsnotworth the thou-
sands of dollars that would be spent
to restore them.

to the collection each year, drawing
money from funds set up to keep the
collection-growing. The collection
is funded by gifts, with big benefac-
tors such as Clinton Rehling and
trustee Samuel Rosenthal fueling its
growth. Wilson estimated that last
year‘s acquisitions cost about
$75,000.

Wilson scoffed at estimating the
collection’s overall worth. The worth
would be almost impossible to cal-
culate, she said, because of fluctuat-
ing an prices. And besides, “We
should never even think of the col-

Robert Redford a Flop (Just Kidding)

By Car] Thelin
and John Paul Schmit

Phonathons are a hideous way to
make money. They involve such
sleazy tactics as manipulating the
more gullible of the recent alums i
not to mention the parents of current
students — into making donations
which they can ill afford.

If you wish to make money in a
more humane and stylish way, then
no doubt The Sting will give you
plenty of ideas.

This movie, set in the 1920‘s,

revolvesaroundahorseracing scam
of brobdingnagian proportions The
plotisfairly intricate but manages to
avoid being confusing. We would
give you a plot synopsis, but this
would min the movie.

Sufﬁce it to say that you should
pay close attention to the action in
the film, as there may be more going
on than you think.

RobertRedford turns in a nauseat-
ingly bland and characterless per-
formance, while Paul Newman does
not even deserve that much praise.

Just kidding. They were both very
good and not the least bit sickening

lcction in monetary terms,” she said,
and only in terms of its educational
value.

Is it a shame that the works spend
most of their time in cold storage?

“Absolutely not," Wilson said.
“Otherwise they would be de»
stroyed.”

In fact, time in storage is many
dated in order to preserve the works;
for every six months a work is on
display. itspends 24 months in stor
age.

“Thepurpose of this wholecollec-
tion is tokeep it in the best condition
possible for the next generation of
students,” Wilson said. “The pur-
pose of the collection is to study and
enjoy it. And we‘re trying to hit that
balance — to study it and enjoy it,
but also to preserve it for the next
several generations of students.”

The Print and Drawing Study
Room was carved out of Burling
Library‘s basement in 1982 as a pan
of the library’s renovation. Wilson
said that in the early days of the
study room, the place was empty.
She said she had to stand in the
doorwayinvitingpcopleintosee the
collection.

These days, she says, “I’m busy
all the time." The college has just
hired an art preparator, graduate
Milton Severe, to help out.

Wilson saidshe’slooking forward
to occupying the gallery building
that would be part of a new arts
complex on campus. “We need more
exhibition space," she said. Thenew
gallery would “provide space for
exhibition of things in the collection
that we currently don’t have the
proper space to exhibit," such as
large paintings. and sculpture and
ceramics, which Wilson said should
be displayed under natural light.

The next exhibit in the Print arid
Drawing Study Room is “Images of
Country and City in 19th» and 20th-
century,”ashoworganizedby Susan
Strauber‘s art-preparation class.
Featured next semesterwill bcshows

Middlebury College, and Tony
Crowley of Grinnell's own an de-
partment'

Things You Never Notice

By Andrew Hamilton

Frozen life and serene intimacy
are on display in the current Forum
gallery exhibit, “People Places
Things"

The exhibit is made up of two
small shows of black and white
photographs. Nonnandie Madden ’s
photos show the detail and individu-
ality which familiar subjects reveal
when they are frozen at the right
moment, while Kevin Docrschug‘s
works explore the hidden personali-
ties which are uncovered by a carer
ful presentation of one’s subjects.

Madden‘s work was taken in the
Washington, D.C. area. She com-
bines some candid photos of bike
couriers with a series of photos of
homeless people in DC. along with
a third group of photos depicting

“people who populate the streets."

Whilediffen'ng widely in subjects,
these three groups of photographs
all pursue a common theme. These
are photos, Madden points out, of
“everyday people doing everyday
things."Theydepict“things thatyou
see all the time, but you never stop
and think about."

In this exhibit, Madden is trying to
depict moments of life. As she ex-
plains, “These are not my best pic-
tures. But that’s not what I was look
ing for."

“I emphasize content more than
technique,” she said. She is attempt-
ing to capture a critical moment
withoutlosing the spontaneity of the
instant.
