Picking Up the Pieces After the Quake

 

By Diane Brumley

Grinnell students have set up two
informal earthquake relief funds to
aid victims of the Oct. 17 quake that
rcrked San Francisco, registering 7
on the Richter scale.

As we all kicked our television
sets that blinked and then wentblank
during the World Series, Grinnell
senior Headier James, who lives in
Menlo Park, about 35 minutes from
Oakland, Calif, braced herself in a
doorway. Fttrthernorth in Los Altos,
aboutan hour away from San Fran
cisco, Caryn Plait braced herself as
she watched all of the drawers and
shelves come ﬂying out of the kitchen
cabinets.

Though neither student’s house
was damaged, and neither they nor
any of their family members was
injured, the realization of the prox-
imity of such extreme danger has
had lasting effects on both James
and Plait, who haveorganized infor-
mal relief efforts in Grinnell to aid
quake victims.

UponretumingtoGrinncll,James,
who lives in an offrcar‘npus house,
said that die rattle of her walls and
floor as an upstairs neighbor climbed
the stairs would “set her off every
time."

Likewise, Plait “freaked out” in
dieDarbyGymcomputerroomwhile
the men’s basketball team below
shook the ﬂoor, making it feel as
though the building was in an earth-
quake.

James said she decided that she
wantedtodosomethingtohelpearth~
quake victims while she was sitting
in her house following the quake.
Once she got back to Grinnell, she

sent some of her own clothes back.
Her friends found out what she was
doing, and word of mouth took it
from there.

Since then, Grace Community
Church in Grinnell, whereJames is a
member, has sent substantial cloth»
ing donations to her. to be passed on
to the Red Cross Earthquake Relief
Fund in California. Although James
herself didn’t publish any requests
for donations. she said Lhatshe would
“accept them willingly” and send
anything ~ clothing, money — to
the Red Cross.

James saidthewayin whichpeople
banded together after the earthquake
was ”a really neat community les-
son. People seemed so willing to
share with one another,"

Although Mcnlo Park and the two
towns on either side of it were “vir-
tually untouched,“ surrounding
towns sustained extensive damage,
she said,

Caryn Plan, a computer user con-
sultant, placed what she termed a
“personal request” on a computer
bulletin board. Her note brieﬂy de-
scribed her experience and then asked
for the donation ofa shift's salary to
the Earthquake Relief Fund. Platt

Red Cross in California

“Quite a few U.C.’s worked not
one, but several earthquake shifts,”
said Plait. “I haven’t tried to make it
an all»campus thing because my
appeal was a personal appeal,“ she
said.

Like Jamcs’, Platt’s house sur-
vived the earthquake with no darn-
age. When she left her house on
Sunday to return to Grinnell, they
had not found so much as a broken

glass. She could. however, “walk to ,

houses thatwere ﬂattened,”a.nd “big
cracks in the earth” were not far
away.

James said it was ironic that as the
whole world watched the crisis on
television and knew what the dam-
age looked like, her family tn Cali-
fornia “sat in our dark house and
listened to our AM transistorradio.”
James's house was WthOul electric-
ity or telephone services for hours
after the quake.

“When people come together to
accomplish something,"saidJames,
“their effort is something very spe-
cialt When they’re doing it only to
prove a point, as some groups do,
then that effort is nothing."

To aid in the earthquake relief
fund, send donations to either Jatnes
or Plait, at post office boxes 7-10 or
1243. Contributions may also be
dropped off either at J ames’s house.
1307 BroadSt.,orPlatt’s room,9023,
in North Younker basement,

“There were so many physical
needs that people had, that donating
clothing seemed like the least thing
I could do,” said J ames.

“I wish I could buy them houses.”
she said.
