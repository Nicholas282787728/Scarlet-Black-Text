Decision On Abortion Is a Woman’s Alone i’l‘i

To the Editor:

I would like to thank Mike Kent
for indulging in some statistical
gymnastics concerning the issue of
abortion, In “Politically Incorrect—
And Proud of It" (Novr l7). Mr.
Kent has generated some tonured
statistics. and performed arithmeti-
cal stunts that easily fall into the pit
of sensationalist righteousness. Were
I so inclined, I could “throw a few
hard facts into the ﬁre," as well,
involving rape, abuseof the adopted
and the failure of birth control, which
couldeasilydousehisclaimsThrow-
ing in statistics creates a diversion
from the real issue.

Instead I would like to address the
question of when human life begins
The most prominent answer in con-
temporary society is: Wedon'tlcnow.
My question to Mr. Kent is: Why
should your opinion concerning the
legalization of abortion supersede
others”! Mri Kent claims that he is
not out to ram his morality downour
throats. but that is what he and others
will accomplish by supporting the
outlawing of abortion. He may have
a point with which many may con-
cur, but personal feelings about the
issue are so varied that the “begin-
ning of life” is obsolete and there-
fore cannot be defined by law.

If abortion is outlawed. many in-
telligent and conscientious people
who do not believe that life begins at
conception (for instance, people in
certain secLs of Judaism which hold
that life does not begin until the ﬁrst

breath) will have that view forced
upon them. The absolute position
that abortion is murder forces mor-
als upon those who do not agree, or
who are not in a position to agree,
Pro-choice is not compulsory abor»
tion, while pro-life is mandatory
pregnancy.

There are people who believe that
abortion is immoral but who also
realize that a stance like Mr. Kent‘s
is complicated by legitimate social
facts. One fact is that we already
have thousands of abused, homeless
or starving children, a problem to
which our nation as of yet has no
remedy. Consequently, these people
are pro-choice; theoperative word is
choice.

I have a scenario that is a bit more
plausible: the Grinnell College
community ﬁnds Mike Kent‘s opin-
ions and writings destructive and
immoral and effectively censors him

Mr. Kentatlempts to protecthis rigth
as a living. breathing, thinking human
being. Does Mr. Kenthavea right to
say and write what he chooses to
believe? The answer is obviously
y“. Does Grinnell College have a
right to declare the opinions of Mr.
Kent totally immoral, destructive.
illogical, as well as a waste of trees.
and thereby silence him? The an-
swer is easily no.

Mr. Kent reacted against any and
all actions which would prohibit him
from voicing his beliefs,as heshould
have. He did not like the morals that
many at Grinnell College wanted to
force upon him,

This is the sameposition in which
many women will find themselves if
abortion is once again criminalized.

Abortion is a personal decision
that must be left to the women who
have to make it.

Grinnell’s Foreign Students May Be
‘Low Priority,’ But We’re Paid Up

 

To the Editor:

An incorrect statement was made
in the article “College Cancels Ban
on Financial Aid to Foreign Stu-
dents Studying Abroa " (Nov. 17).

We, as foreign students, want
people to know that not all intema-
tional students have at least half of
their tuition paid by the Grinnell
foreign grant. as claimed by James

Lincoln, direcmr of ﬁnancial aid.
Several foreign students pay full
tuition regardless of often disadvan-
taged differences in currency ex-
change rates. Should these students
be subjected to the quota restriction
set by the college? Or are these stu~

dents also “low-priority"?

D.C. March: A11 Inspiration, Not a Let—Down

 

To the Editor:

If you read the article in the last S
81. B about the DC. abortion rights
rally, it was easy to get the impres-
sion that the people who participated
were disappointed. We were not
disappointed at all. We thought it
was impormnt to have the Novem-
bermllysonoonewouldthinkpeople
have forgotten about abortion rights
after the July Supreme Court deci-
sion.Wewantedtoreafﬁrmourcom-
mitrnenttowomen‘srighttochoose.

The smaller number of partici-
pants at this rally as compared to the
one last April did not bother us.
There were still somewherebetween

100,000 and 300,000 people. Al-
though most there were white and
college age, the crowd was diverse
to some extent. We saw people from
all over the country (Oregon, Penn-
sylvania,Califomia,Alaska),people
from all kinds of professions (astro-
physicists, doctors. teachers) and
peopleproclaiming many other traits
that set them apart from your aver-
age white liberals (a good ol’ boy
from Nonh Carolina, a mother of
three, grandparents, gays and lesbir
ans, women of color, socialists).
Although we will not guess at a
percentage, men made up a great
proportion of the participants.

 

How to Stretch Your Fog Fast Dollar

 

To the Editor:

In conjunction with Fog Fast to-
day, some local restaurants will
donate a portion of the money that
college students spend on meals
tonight to the Catholic Worker
Community's shelter in Des Moines
— the only place that families can
find emergency shelter in the city.

The shelter does not charge for
food or bed space and has no regular
source of income. With the recent
closings of the Kindred Commua
nity's shelters. the need for shelter

space in Des Moines is more desper-
ate than ever.

Please identify yourself as a stu
dent when you eat at Back Alley
Deli, Breadeaux Pisa, Country
Kitchen. Farmer Nick’s, Hardee's,
I.D.’s, Jimbo’s or Pagliai’s Pizza.

If you are interested in working
with the Catholic Worker Commur
nity, Students Helping the Home-
less leavcs from the Forum Grill
every Sat. at 11 am.

It is important to take into consid
eration not only the political ramift-
cations of the rally and the statistics
concerning it, but what the individ-
ual participants gotoutof the expe-
rience. The success of the rally can-
not be judged by the numbers of
people who went. butby whatpeople
get out of it personally. The atmos~
phere of the day can best be de-
scribed by what we saw while we
stood at the base of the Washington

Monument and watched people.

walking from the subway as they
ﬁrst caught a glimpse of the crowd.
Everyone’s mouths dropped open,
they starred in amazement, and said

“Wow!"
