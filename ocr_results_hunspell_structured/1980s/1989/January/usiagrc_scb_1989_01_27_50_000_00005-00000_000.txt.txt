squeamish

by Matt Macho
Imagine, if you will, going
on a white-water canoeing trip in
the Deep South with a couple of
friends, only to get lost in the
middle of nowhere and viciously
attacked and abused by a couple
of shotgun-wielding hillbillies.
Deliverance is the story of
how Burt Reynolds and three
friends stumble into just such a
nightmare and attempt to make it
out alive. The intensity
sustained during the film is
nearly unbearable. The
atmosphere of terror, punctuated
by brief episodes of violence and
despair, will keep you tense for
most of the ﬁlm‘s lengthilhis
is not a movie for the squeamish.
Even the dueling banjo scene, the
ﬁlm’s only light moment, has a

disquieting undercurrent of
menacei One of the travelers
jams with a local banjo player,
but the kid is disfigured, and
doesn’t recognize the group in the
next scene.

There's an interesting element
of psychology to the film, as the
characters deal with their
predicament with varying degrees
of success, often taxing the
limits of sanity, The
sociological message isn’t too
subtle (Hell is the Deep South,
populated with vicious retarded
rednecks driving pickup trucks
with gun racks), but it’s
successfully conveyed I recomv
mend Deliverance highly, but it
is NOT light entertainmenL

THIEVES

by Blair Kolb

This Saturday at 9 pm. in
Gardner Lounge, the SGA
Concerts Committee presents
l-lonor Among Thieves, an R KL
B band from Madison, Wis.
They have been playing in the
Madison area for a number of
years and recently released an
album, When the World Ruhr
Fart, on the Flaming Pie label.
Anyone who has seen them live
or has listened to this album
could tell you that Honor Among
Thieves is one of the hottest
small bands around In their live
act, they do a combination of R

& B classics, too numerous to
mention here, and a lot of their

,own material. The material they

write themselves is on the same
level, for energy and dancibillty,
as James Brown or BB. King.
While not for those who like
huge numbers of different synthr
effecLs or inane lyrics, Honor
Among Thieves will definitely
provide a great time for those of
us who like basic. driving rock
and rhythm and blues.
Remember to mark it on your
new shiny black calendar of
events, 9 pm. Saturday night.
