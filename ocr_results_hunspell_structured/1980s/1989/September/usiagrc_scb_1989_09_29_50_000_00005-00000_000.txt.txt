KDIC Kicks Oﬂ ‘Best Semester’
Yet, Says Its Station Manager

 

By Craig Hooper

KDIC, the campus radio station,
began its year well, with what looks
to be “one of the best semmers in
terms of quality shows." says station
manger Kate Nosan.

KDIC’s eight-member staff has
had its hands full recently. Out of
this semester’s 75 disc jockeys. 55
are new to the station. Periodic equip—
ment breakdowns have added to the
station’s growing pains.

“I have a repairman coming out
here two times a day," sighs Nosan.

Nosan says she is is hoping to
avoid broadcasting problems this
semester. “The Federal Communi’
cations Commission is in the proc-
ess of reevaluating our broadcast-
ing license. so we want to be sure
everything goes well," she said. The
re-evaluation is a periodic ﬁve-year
process, normal procedure for all
radio stations Nosan said she ex-
pects to have no trouble getting the
broadcasting license renewed.

KDIC has come a long way from
it's lowly lO-watt origins, when,
legend has it. the staff hooked the
transmitter to the railroad tracks to
increase the broadcast range. Now

Meanwhile, plans to
move the studio to a
new location are
under discussion.

the IOOwau station is themostpub-
lic studentactivity on campus, reach-
ing everyonewithin a 15. to ZOAmile
radius.

The station has even eamcdaplace
in one of the premier progressive
music magazines, the CM New
Music Report. KDIC sends a list of
all the songs played the most to the
New Music Report. used by record
executives throughout the industry.
Placement in the magazine guaran-
tees many free promotional records.
“We usually receive about 30 rec-
ords a week," said Nosan.

The new records are an increasing
bruden for the station, for the li»
brary, already jammed with 15,000
albums, is almost overﬂowing.
Nosan predicts, “By the end of the
year, we will have to clean out old,
little-used recordings to get space."
The station keeps track of the grow—
ing collection by registering every

Seven Court Eunuchs
for The Last Emperor

By Carl Thelin
and John Paul Schmit

The last emperor of the Ching
Dynasty was working as which of
the following when he died: A) a
marine biologist, B) a gardener, C) a
sky-diving instructor, D) a despotic
tool of the bourgeoisie, E) it cannot
be determined from the information
given.

You’ll ﬁnd out if you watch this
ﬁne piece of celluloid, The Last Em-
peror, which is the true story ofthe
life of the last emperor of China. If
you’ve ever wondered what it must
be like to be a puppet ruler manipu-
lalrd by forces beyond your control.
this is your chance to ﬁnd out.

This ﬁlm is superbly directed and

features a stunning performance by
whoever that is who plays the em‘
peror. Peter O’Toole also wows the

audience with his incredible bicy~
cling performance The bluergrey
tint in some of the scenes. by the
way, is really a clever cinematic
technique, and not an error in film
development as someone who is
artistically oblivious might think.

The future of KDIC looks bright,
with plans to move the radio station
to a new location now under discusA

_ sion. Right now, however, the sta-

tion is in a relative limbo, because
“we don’t want to put in expensive
new equipment until we know what
ourfutureplanswillbe."Nosan said.

The station is keeping in step with
the industry-wide trend toward
compact discs with the addition of
two CD players. But new technol-
ogy does have its complications.

“The CD players play CD’s only
when they feel like it." Nosan said.

But Nosan said she is relatively
pleased with the situation. “Wehave
a lot, when we compare ourselves
with othercollege stations."

Air time is reserved for the disc
jockeys, with the staff working to
make the DJ experience as reward-
ing as possible. The staff members
putin long hours, and the senior staff
members can work up to 30 hours a
week. Nosan justiﬁes her work by
saying. “I try to make it easier and
fun for the DJ ’s.because their shows
are much more fun for the audi-
ence."

The Naked Gun — Firing
Satirical Fun at Cop Shows

By Matthew F. Nagy

Humor takes on manyforms, from
the sophisticated humor of Woody
Allen to the outrageous anarchy of
Monty Python. and not everyone
enjoys them all. Be thatas itmay, if
you ﬁnd you laugh aloud at least
twice a day, and have no strong
aversion to somewhat sophomoric
humor, then you will find some en-
tcnainmentvaluein TheNaked Gun.

The Naked Gun

police show
ever created.
Don’t miss it.

be lightly passed by.

by an outstanding cast of comic
characters, including the digniﬁed
(in appearance only) Leslie Nielson
and the effortlessly evil Ricardo
Montalban. Other members of the
cast include Priscilla Presley, OJ.
Simpson and John Houseman as the
calmest driving instructor in the
world.

While many members of this cast
are known for their dramatic roles.
this is an essential part of The Naked
Gun’shumor. As Dave Zucker. who
also directed the movie, describes it,
“Our humor is in what the characters
are doing. You can’t have some
comedian winking at the camera. It
has to be played as seriously as
possible. Like you‘re watching this
perfectly straight cop show, and
weird things happen."

Indeed, The Naked Gun spoofs
every police show evercreated. Don’t
miss this uproarious comedy.
