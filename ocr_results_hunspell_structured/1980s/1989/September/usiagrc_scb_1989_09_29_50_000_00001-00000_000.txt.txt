cases.

By Brendan Shepherd

Controversial posters for the group
Students Against Hippies drew a
condemnation from the Student
Government Association this week
and have apparently sparked two
JudicialCouncilcases—oneagainst
the group’s founder and the other
against people who tore the posters
down.

Sophomore Mike Kent, the
group’s founder. has meanwhile
threatened to sue the college in civil
court if the college takes any disci-
plinary action against him. .

Atits weekly meeting Wednesday
night, Joint Board of SGA passed a
resolution condemning the “espou-
sal of violence against community
members” and the use of violence in
“comic expression,” and said that
such speech “constitutes harass-

Gov ’t Spares Grinnell
In Financial Aid Inquiry

By Steve Pickle

When it comes to awarding finan»
cial aid, Grinnell’s hands are clean,
college officials say.

According to theofficesof admis-
sion and financial aid, Grinnell
doesn‘t engage in the questionable
practices that got 20 colleges inves-
tigated by me federal government
this summer.

In the Justice Department investi-
gation, 20 select colleges and uni-
versities were cited for possible anti-
trust violations because of their use
of “pricefixing” practices to set
ﬁnancial aid awards. The investiga
tion included Harvard, the Univer
sity of Chicago, Dartmouth, Wilv
liams, Bowdoin and Tufts.

Grinnell would not have been

included in the investigation, as it
does not discuss specific student
financial aid awards with any other
colleges and universities, college
officials say. According to James
Lincoln, director of financial aid,
and John Hopkins, director of ad-
missions, Grinnell neither “buys"
students with lucrative financial aid
packages nor “pulls the rug out"
from under students by reducing
financial aid after an individual’s
ﬁrst year.

The issue ofprice-ﬁxing in higher
education was raised this summer
after the Justice Department had
contacted over 20 liberal arts col-
leges and universities about the prac-
tice of comparing ﬁgures on stu-

Eight black alumni returned to
Grinnell last week to evaluate the
minority situation here and gave the
administration a strong message: if
you want minority students to apply
to Grinnell, you’ll have to hire mir
nority faculty first. The committee
cited the low number of minority
faculty members as the primary is—

Construction of the Harris
Student Center started this
week,

Gethman Construction Co.
has begun preparing the site.
between Cowles Hall and the
Physical Education Complex.
for the construction of the
$3,035,000 student center.

Constructionof the center was
stalled in August after the low-
est bid from building contrac-
tors exceeded the building's
construction budgetof$2.7 mil-
lion by $400,000.

But in September the
college’s board of trustees
agreed to ﬁnance the building
with only minor cutbacks in
facilities.

Some $65,000 was saved by
cutting out sidewalks and ex-
changing some permanentseat~
ing for folding chairs.

 

Work on Harris Center

Is Already Underway

The Harris Center, named for
its primary benefactors, alumni
Jack and Lucich-lanson Han-is,
is to be located on North Cam-
pus between Cowles Hall and
the Physical Education Come
plex and is designed to include
a movie theater, concert hall
and quarters for the Grinnell
Outdoor Recreation Program.

The contractor says work
should take 13 months and the
building should be complete
Nov. 1, 1990.

“In the long run for Grinnell
College, there‘s no question we
made the right decision. This is
the building we need, for now
and forthefuture,"college presi-
dent George Drake has said of
the building.

“And we should build it, pro-
vided we don’t think that it’s
exorbitant,” he said.

support, Jones added that the entire
staff — and not only its minority
members — need to provide that
Support.

The addition of minority faculty
and students would, in turn, beneﬁt
the whole campus, Jones said.

“All students will benefit from
more peoples,“ he said. “Then you
will find the diversityvthat Grinnell]
talks about so much.” A

Other faculty members also recr
ognize the importance of multi-cul»
tural diversity in a liberal arts educa-
tion. A multi-culturztl environment
is provided through college faculty
and curriculum, said Kesho Scott,
assistantprofessor of American stud-

ies and sociology.

“Black faculty serve as a tool for
recruitment, retention, and the qual-
ity of alibcral arts education atGrinr
nell," she said. “Creating a multir
cultural community also enables
whitestudents to benefit; America is
a country of diverse cultures.“

According to Drake, the commit-
tee pointed out that Grinnell‘s “ef-
forts for admission and recruitment
of minorities do not reach the goals
of a multi-cultural community."

The committee‘s advice to Drake,
according to Scott, was therefore to
concentrate on the recruitmentprocv
