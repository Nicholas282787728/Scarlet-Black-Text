Softball team makes
history, breaks record

by Laura Whiunere

The next time you see a
lnctnher of the Grinnell softball
team, you might want to offer
your congratulations. While cv»
eryone else was sitting around
enjoying Peace Day, tllcy were
sweeping a tough doubleheader
against conference archrival
Knox, setting Grinnell softball
records along the way.

First, the games. In game
one, Grinnell and Knox were
locked in a tel no tip to the ninth
inliing (one inning away from the
tireatietl internationalrrules play
with each half of the inning
starting with a runner on second).
Mary Allcnburg led off the ninth
with a single and moved to see-
ontl on n bunt by Diana Lewis.
Pain Frecsc moved Allenburg to
third art a ﬁelder's choice. Karen
Gleunemcicr followed with a
perfectly placer! [worstrike hunt
to score Allenburg. The Pioneers
contained the Siwash in Lhe bot»
tom half of the inning to win 2-
I.

In their final game of the
season, Grinnell scored two runs
in the ﬁrst inning off a walk by
Neva Spccht, a triple by Terra
Geiger, and Judy Thorn's RBI.

Softball coach Jim
Gilbert: "It is from this
point that future success
will be measured.

Thanks to the strength of Allen-
burg's pitching and a erong dee
fense, that’s all the Pioneers
needed shutout the Siwash 2-0.

Co h Gilbert was pleased
with his squatl‘s final perfor-
mance, saying, “At this point
now. we‘ve shown that we can
compete with every team in the
conference." Last week Gilbert
said that success should be mea-
sured from where a team begins,
and by that definition, his team
has been (I success.

Just two years ago the soft-
hall program was almost dropped.
Perseverance paid off, since the
198‘) Pioneer squad has set the
all-time record ror wins by a
Grinncll softball team, surpass
mg the previous eight»win record.
With a 10-8 record they also as
tablishcd the first winning season
ever by a Grinncll softball team.

Coach Gilbert credits the se-
niors for their leadership and
contribution to the season, and he
looks towards future success.
“For the seniors it is a tremen-

dous finale, because they were the
backbone of turning the program
around," he said. "For the rest of
the team it is a beginning. It is
from this point that future sue-
ecss will be measured."

On Wednesday, the team held
its banquet at Grinnell House
where the players were awarded
for their season-long efforts.
Jennifer Hughes was named Most
Improved, while Rookie of the
Year honors were shared by
Geiger and Chris Tumbull. The
Golden Glove was awarded to
Specht and Ginny Frazer, with
the “Big Bat" going to Thorn.
Spccht and Allcnburg shared
MVP honors.

Freese commented, "It's been
a special year for the seniors,
considering the history of the
team. We were JUSl glad to be
here, and proud we could help the
team to achieve this record.” Dir
ana Lewis sumlned it up best:
“What can I say? We had a ton
of fun and I’ll miss it lots."
Anyone who was fortunate to see
the team play this season knows
what she means.

undefeated Scotrs were too much for the Pioneers, winning Sunday's contest 1L6.

Pioneers let moment slip away,
fall out of playoff contention

by Bob Lifton
All the elements were in

place. The table Couldn’t have
been set any better. Too bad the
wrong people came to dinner.

Last weekend, the Pioneers
had the stage just how they
wanted it: secondrplacc Knox had
gone into a tailspin, losing three
straight, and they were hosting
the divisional tournament in their
own backyard If there was ever
an opportune time to take advanr
rage of a situation, this was
clearly it.

Things naturally didn’t go as
planned. The Pioneers managed
to salvage only one of their three
games, making the weekend se-
ries anything but peaeerut.
Ironically~or sadly, depending
on your perspectivcﬁGrinnell’s
lone win came Sunday against
Knox, 4-3. This victory was
Sandwiched between two painful
defeats: Saturday's 8-4 loss to
Illinois College, and Sunday’s
1176 backbrcakcr to undefeated
Monmouth.

If the Pioneers (4-7) had
managed to fight off I.C., they

would have been sitting pretty in
the conference race, And even
with the loss, they were only a

IitlIllllllllllllllllllimllllmitrirlin

game and a half out of second
place—crucial, since two teams
from each division advance to the
playoffs. Virtually all post-sca-
son talk came to a screeching halt
Tuesday, however, as the Pio-
neers fell to a suddenly revamped
Coe squad, 5-1 and 43. Oh, how
strange that little ball can
bounce.

Needless to say, Coach Mar-
tinek wasn't pleased with his
team's recent losing binge. “1
was disappointed with the week-
end. We have lost four of our
last five games, knocking us out
of a playoff position. . .What a
difference a week can make. Our
bats just went to sleep."

Illinois College didn’t waste
any titne taking advantage of the
Pioneers' hitting lull, opening
tllc floodgates in the second in-
ning with six runs to break a 1'1
tie. Grinnell pitcher Brad Sheri-
dan simply couldn’t find the
plate, as the Blueboy batters
ripped pitch after pitch to the
fence. Marty Htlnsucker and
Mick Kulikowski represented the
Pioneer’s only real bright spots,
combining for four of Grinnell's
eight total hits.

fortunately, their bats wouldn'f

Their luck of offense particu-
larly irked Martinek. “We should

Our guys were looking to draw
the walk instead of the base hit."
Little or no hitting is especially
disturbing when your opponents
are crushing everything in sight.

In Sunday's game against
Knox, the Pioneers received it
