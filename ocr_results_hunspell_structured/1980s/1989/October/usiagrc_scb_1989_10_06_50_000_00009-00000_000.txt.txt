ticularly well. Chairs, tables and
several low, covered benches are
moved around the stage Space to
indicate change in place. enhanced
by a concurrent change in lighting.
The actors move the {umiture them-
selves and carry their hand props
onto the stage. Given the limitations
of Arena's small theater space, this
is a wise choice. The actors are only
a few feet from the audience, and
having them move the set pieces
contributes to the feeling of inti-
macy and aids in the organic move-
ment of the play.

Uncommon Women’s sound de-
sign is cleverly handled. Particu-
larly good musical choices include
“American Woman," which opens
the show, and “Wipe-Out," played
while the women considertltcir post-
graduation plans. A male voice
(college vice-president Waldo
Walker) extols the virtues of an all-
women‘s college andenumerates the
thousands of exciting choices for
women, whether it is having an all-
encompassing career. raisinga fam-
ily or juggling the two.

Aftera slow ﬁrst scene. where the

dialogue is stilted and some of the
excitement of the reunion seems a
little forced, the play moves along
quickly. Unfortunately, many of the
conversations of the selfvdescn'bcd

bly more a fault of Wasserstein’s
writing than of the actors' perform—
ance.

However, Uncommon Women and
Others is a very funny play, and
though much of thelanguage is dated
and trite, the frustrations and feel-

ings of these women seem genuine.
Further, the actors“ knowledge that
the lines are funny and that the audi—
ence is programmed to laugh at cer-
tain points in the play rarely gets in
the way of their delivery.

The general level of acting is hi gh.
The best thing about the play is the
cameraderic between the actors.
They are truly working as an en»
semble, and it is easy to believe that
they have all goneto school together
for four years, like each other. re»
spect each other, and are comfort»
able enough together to discuss
thingslike menstrual blood and penis
envy. No lines Wasserstein could
have written about the sisterhood of
women could havemore impactthan
the sense the audience gets that these
women are truly living and working
together. The actors are to be com-
mended for the over-all ensemble
feeling of the cast.

Foraplay with such a strong sense
of ensemble, individual perform-
ances were particularly good. Judy
Thom, who plays Holly Kaplan as
an insecure, overweight girl want—
ing love and success and physical
perfection, all without much work,
delivers a very fine monologue. She

hits almost every emotional nuance
directly, working with an economy
that undercuts the desparation her
character feels

energy the other actors would do
well to match. They are two of the
most interesting characters as well,
more emotionally needy than others
in theplay. although itwould benice
to see their insecurities a little fur—
ther developed. Kate Quinn, played
by Laura Blackwell, is so dis-
gustingly perfect, and conversely.
so horribly shallow and thoughtless.
that by the final scene it is a relief to
have her walk off of the stage.

The four characters trapped for-

ever in 1972, Susie Friend (Elisa
Erali), Leilah (Lama Momn),Carter
(Bridget Wilcox) and Mrs. Plumm
(Alison Wade) are less convincingly
played than their classmates Susie
Friend and Mrs. Plumm are very
funny, but they are not quite real.
Carter is catatonic and Leilah is
especially brittle. This odd charac—
terization must be motivated by the
fact that their actions are remem-
bered, and are so probably exager-
rated. This is especially evident in
the obnoxious Susie and the ditsy
Mrs. Plumm. Unfortunately, none
of Susie‘s words ring true, and it is
hard to imagine a Mount Holyoke
housemother as clueless as Mrs.
Plumm. They are certainly very
funny caricatures, but one wishes
that they were a little more real.
Again, the fault may lie in
Wasserstein’s writing or the in the
direction and not in the acting.

In all, the production is good. It is
well staged and acted, and the en-
semble feeling of the cast is espe»
cially commendable. It raises inter-
esting points aboutthe early years of
the women’s movements, the choices
women had lhen,and thecorrespond-
ing choices they have now.
