Alvin Ailey to Dance to Sell—Out Crowd

By Craig Hooper

. The Alvin Ailey Repertory En-
semble rolls into town tonight to
perform in Roberts Theatre to a sell»
out crowd. They will offer three
dance presentations — “Streams,”
“I See The Moon and the Moon Sees
Me" and “lSBA” — all modern se-
lections, first performed in the Sev-
enties and early Eighties.

'I'hestudent body seems well aware
of the treat that the Public Events
Committee has cooked up. Students
say that the enorntous ticket line in
Tne Fomm went through the coffee-
house and out the door. Some people
waited in line for over 40 minutes.

The precious tickets were doled
out starting at noon Tuesday, and by
evening only a few seats were left.
The rest of the tickets were gone by
Thursday.

' The Alvin Ailey Repertory En-
semble is made up of handpicked
scholarship students from Alvin
Ailey’s famed American Dance
Center. The Repertory Ensemble is
a feeder to the main theatre, with
over 30 ensemble members chosen
to join the Dance Center as principal
dancers.

x Since the ensemble’s beginnings
in 1974 the group has been perfonn-
ing atcolleges, universities. and high
s‘chools around the country. This
year, the group is not only touring
coast-to-coast. but has performed at
Les Centre Des Aries in Pointe A
Pintre, Guadeloupe, and has com-
pletedathree—weekresidencyinNew
Lersey. Last year, the ensemble per»
formed in the Bahamas, opened the
Annual Festival of Fort de France,
opened the 1988 Jacob’s Pillow
pence Festival and continued tour-
ing and working as a resident dance
Company in New Jersey and Kansas
City.

As for quality of performance,
iieviews tell the story. The Lancaster
New Era said a performance was

 

 

 

Troy Powell of the Alvin Ailey Ensemble in “Nanigizmo”

 

“loaded 'with athletic, strong, aggres-
sive dancing that probably had most
of the audience members wishing
they could get up on stage and leap
and kick right along with the danc-
ers."

The Carbondale Illinois wrote
glowingly of the company, “The
dancers seemed not to follow the
music, but rather, to accompany it
with harmonies, rhythms and melov
dies created by theirbodiest Although
they differed in dance and music
styles,allthreedancesredefinedwhat
itmeans to be human with theseem-
ingly impossible movements and
powerful emotions created by the

dancers."

It looks as if the Public Events
Committee, the same group that
brought “You Strike the Woman,
You Strike the Rock" to campus. has
brought us another wonderful eve-
ning of entertainment. This spring,
the committee will do just as well,
with a return performance by bat-i7
tone Olaf Baer. Baer made his
American debut at Grinnell and is
now singing at Lincoln Center in
New YorkandinSan Francisco.The
Committee also plans to present
Baltimore Consort, a group that
specializes in early renaissance

:Never Cry Wolf: Relations in the Arctic North

By Andrew Hamilton

i Based on Farley Mowatt’s actual
gtudy of Arctic wolves for the Ot-
tawa Wildlife Service. Never Cry
Wolf is an involving tale of survival
and learning, It is a stunning film —
a warm-hearted, enthralling adven-
ture.
N When wemeetoureagerscientist,
J‘yler (Charles Martin Smith), he is
rather inexperienced in adventuring,
and his interest in Arctic wolves
Stops somewhat short of traveling to
anuninhabitedarcaofthcgrcatwhite
porth in order to study them

The fickle ﬁnger of fate, however,
has no conscience and Tyler is
shipped off to the frozen tundra.
Tyler‘s early misadventures are
humerous as he learns how to sur-
vive in the wilderness. With the help

ofamysteriousEskimo,Tylergrows
accustomed to life in the wild. Set-
ting up camp near a wolf pack, the
scientist begins to study the wolves.
But it soon becomes evident that the
wolves are studying the scientist as
well.

The tale is witty and haunting, by
turns. At one point, Tyler decides to
do a field experiment to decide
whetheritispossiblethat the wolves
survive in the off~caribou season on
the protein gained from field mice
alone. What better way to test this
hypodtesis,hcreasons,thanby trying

the diet himself? And so, Tyler tests
his theory, and rids his shelter of
mice at the same time.

The bond which slowly grows
between the wolves and Tyler is
extraordinary It is fascinating to
watch the relationship between Ty-
ler and the pack solidify, until the
scientist is, in the end, virtually ac-
cepted as a member of the commu-
nity.

The movie is excellently filmed.
The beautiful manner in which the
scenery is portrayed is evocative of
director Carroll Ballard’s other
feature, The Black Stallion.

The grandeur of the primitive
scenery mirrors the very extraordi-
nary, yet simple relationship which
is shown to exist between a human
from Canada, and a pack of Arctic
wolves,

 

The Shining: a Demonic Frenzy

By Jennifer Mattes

The Shining, directed by Stanley
Kubrick and released to tepid rer
views in 1980, is a forceful adapta—
tion of Stephen King’s novel of the
same “SIDE.

When a washed-up, on-the-wagon
English teacher accepts the position
of off~season care-taker at a grand
old Colorado mountain resort, he
brings his wife and son along, hope
ing to write a play and salvage his
faltering familysituation atthesame
time. However, the resort has a
morbid history of gangsters and
bloodshed, the caretaker’s son.
Danny, possesses unforeseen tele-
pathic capabilities and the caretaker
is Jack Nicholson, so something is
bound to go awry sooner or later.
What begins as a psychological case
study of cabin feverspirals unavoidaa
bly into a supernatural fiasco.

Kubrick gets the most out of his
cast. Nicholson is unsurprisingly
excellent, as his tenuously mainr
tained civility deteriorates into a

demonic frenzy under the pressures
ofsuggestive evil and his own alco-
holic past. Shelly Duvall, as his wife
Wendy, provides a perfect foil to
Nicholson’s explosive temper. Her
presence is at times annoying, as she
lapses into a whining, trembling
mode of fright and becomes a sortof
latter»day Shclly Winters. The en

Danny’s plight, meets with an unde»

Critics expected Kubrick to do
some sort of intellectual, genius topv
spin with The Shining. What he does
instead, to far greater effect, is pro-
vide an entenaining, tightly woven
horror film which is a showcase for
Nicholson‘s talents. Ed McMahon‘s
“Tonight Show” spiel will never be
the same again.

A Grim Conspiracy Revealed

By John Paul Schmit
and Carl 'I‘helin

You may think thatAn American
Werewolf inLondon is being shown
just to get people in the Halloween
spirit. In reality, it is a conspiracy on
the part of the Grinnell-in-London
students to get their friends to call or
write them and see if they are all
right.

This movie graphically illustrates
the hazards of studying in a foreign
country. The story centers on two
American college students who are

hiking in the English countryside.
Earlyon,theyareattackedbywolves,
and one student dies and gradually
decomposes while the other is trans-
formed into a werewolf.

This movie‘s greatness lies in its
unique treatment of the ethics of
lycanthropy, not to mention its fun
soundtrack. The film is witty, sus-
penseful and has a cult following,
making it an ideal choice for Hal-
loween.

On a scale of one to 13 places of
touristic interest, this film receives a
ten.
