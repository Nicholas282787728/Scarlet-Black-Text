Portraits of
Trees , ‘from

Head to Toe’

By Andrew Hamilton

Born and raised in Brooklyn,New
York, Amy Lilienfeld had more of a
chance to study the hard lines of
cityscape than the trees of the Mid-
west when she was growing up. But
a college career at Colorado Swte
University changed that. While pur-
suing her chemistry degree, Lilien-
feld crossed the Midwest repeatedly
during her trips home and back to
school. And so she fell in love with
the rolling prairies of the Heartland.

Thisaffection and familiarity with
the Midwest, its landscapes, and
particularly its trees, is evident in
Lilienfeld’s exhibit. Trees in Prairie
Towns. showing now at the Burling
Library Print and Drawing Study
Room.

In some ways, this exhibit is a
return for Lilienfeld. S he was work-
ing at The Kitchen in Iowa City to
support her photography aﬁer col~
lege. when Grinnell’s Kay Wilson
noticed her work on display at the
rmtauranL This led to Lilienfeld‘s
exhibition of the Iowa Series, a col-
lection of agricultural landscapes,
which was shownatGrinnellirr 1981
The series of photographs was even-
tually purchased for display in Iowa
state government buildings.

LilienfeldretumstoGrinnell now,
with her study of Midwest trees *
portraits “from head to toe," as the
artist explains.

The photographs are technically
ﬂawless. Lilienfeld‘s crisp, clean
style reveals her subjects in all their
magnitude Her detail explores their
rich textures. And the artist uses the
interplay of light and dark shadows,
soft and hard lines, to bring out such
striking volume in her portraits that
it is hard to believe these are two-
dirnensional representations.

From looking at the photographs,
it quickly becomes evident that the
trees are very personal to the artist
Each has its own atritude, its own
personality and its own story. These
traitsareexplored in depﬂr by Lilien-
feld, who portrays only those trees

Symposium on Theater .

the most talented Chicano writers,

which she has spent much time
around. When asked to include a
number of Grinnell trees in this
exhibit, the artist tried, but said she
was unable to capture truly repre-
sentative portraits because she did
notunderstandthetreeswellenough.

This close communion, which can
come only from repeated and pro-

longed exposure to one’ssubjects, is‘

reﬂected in each portrait The line
between objective observer and
subject is minimized, even tran-
scended She has effectively closed
the gap between the beholder and
the life beheld. The engrossing pho—
tographs bear testimony to the fact
thatLilienfeld has become emotion-
ally,as well asintellechrally involved
with her work

While presenting portraits of spe-
cific trees, these photographs also
explore an intriguing theme Lilien-

feldwasorigiually interested in por-
traying only trees However, when
photographing Trees in Prairie
Towns, she couldn‘t help capturing
the odd power line, or a curb, or a
house as well, While the trees dis-
play anatural splendor all their own,
theycannotbeentirelydisconnected
from the artificiality of their sur-
roundings. The fire hydrants and
sagging power lines, even the Speed
Lube station in one photograph —
all these are part of the personalities
of the trees

But there is an even more para-
doxical twist, if we dig a bit deeper.
What are trees doing on a prairie,
anyway’.7

Trees were not generally compat-
ible with theprairies of North Amer-
icat So the idea of “prairie trees" is
paradoxical. A large number of the
trees found in prairie towns have
been planted by people, or come
from trees which have been planted
by people. So the line between what
is natural and whatis artiﬁcial grows
even dimmer.

But in the end, the distiction be-
tween nature and humanity does not
matter. The trees and the town are
inextricably intertwined. The cool
shadows of the trees mirror the
shadow of nearby buildings. The
great bulk of the oak, its branches
almost absurdly large, mimics the
volume and stability of a nearby
house. The trees and towns have
grown so interrelated that the photo-
graphs reveal as much about me
humans who live around the trees as
they do about the trees themselves.

pottery * many of which are for
sale. The proceett will go the Stu-
dents Helping the Homeless group

Lauver points to Hopper, Monet,
O’Keefe and especially Homer as
her major influences The influence
of these masters in evident in much
of her work.

But perhaps more striking is the
aspect of change and progression
from the earlier works to the later
pieces.

Iauver says she “wanted to show
the contrast" between her high
school works and the pieces she has
produced more recently. Lauver
pinpoints the difference between her
earlier and later work, explaining

American society today.

Other issues to be discussed dur- ‘
ing the symposium will include i
Chicano assimilation in contempo-
rary American society, the current‘
status of migrant farm workers in the t
US and the Chicano population ,
boom. The hope, according to Pro-
fessor Stephenson, is that members ‘
of the Grinnell community will take 1
away from the symposium a basics
understanding of issues facing the
Chicano community and perhaps ’
more important, a greater apprecia- -
tion for the contributions that Chica- ‘
nos and Chicanas have made to
American society. ’

“We hope that the symposium will 1
be a nice starting point— a point of .
departure for raising awareness and
getting some of these issues dis— '
cussed oncampus." Stephenson said ,

The symposium will be high-
lighted with a talk by Cesar Chavez,
president of the United Farm Work-
ers, on “the Wrath of Grapes" at the ,
Scholar‘s Convocation Thursday.
Chavez founded and now leads what *
was the ﬁrSt successful farm work- r
ers‘ union in US history. Atage 10, ,

farm worker life when his father lost“
his farm in the Depression. In 1952, A

— All of Her:

that her more recent work is “more‘
developed — more pastoral." ‘

The progression is evident when
wecomparethestraightforwardlines
of “The Teacher Made Me Do It‘”
(1983) with the more abstract, un-a
real quality of “A Sense of Isola-‘
tion" (1939).

While these differences do cer»'
tainly make for a contrast betweem
the earlier and later works, there are
constants which run through all the
pieces. For example, lauver points‘
out that light shadow and nature are.
"three basic things' rn all my works"
The continuity is seen in the pro-
gression from the uncomplicated and
effective style of the watercolor,
“Irish Seaman” (1984) to the more
developed, yet quite similar “Pen-r
rose St 10th" (1989). The similari-A
ties in the lighting and soft coloring
tie these two pieces together. The
continuing themes of light. shadow‘
and nature pull Lauver s earlier and-
later works together.

Iauver says she has found rt diffr-
cult to find enough time for her art."
A biology major with plans to pure
sue a PhD. and MD, Lauver says,
that much of her art has been done
“at the expense of other studies,“
However, she plans to continue-
doing art work when she can ﬁnd the2
time. Although it is often an effort
to make time for her art, Lauver‘
says, “it’s something I love." .
