Biology Professor Kenneth Christiansen announced an end to his teaching career.

Christiansen set to retire

by Howard Gardos

Biology Professor Kenneth Christiansen, a
member of the Grinnell College faculty for over 30
years, has announced his retirement at the end of
this academic year. Christiansen taught three years
at the American University in Beirut, then another
at Smith College, before settling in Grinnell in
1955.

Christiansen does not plan to continue teaching
in the near future, but he will continue to
contribute to his field. “I plan to continue my re-
search and to do a lot of traveling,“ he said.

Christiansen has done research in a variety of
different fields. He has studied taxonomy, aspects
of evolution, and the study of collenbola [an
insect]. While teaching at Grinnell he has had over

50 papers published. He has also taken part in
writing Collenbola of North America and is
working on Collenbola of Hawaii. He helped
establish a number of interdisciplinary studies.

Besides his work in the biology department,
Christiansen has also contributed to Grinnell in
another fashion. He has performed in several
amateur drama productions, including a performance
in Chekhov’s The Three Sisters earlier this year.

Christiansen plans to keep Grinnell his

headquarters in the future. He said, “The caliber of
students and faculty here is as good or better than
since I've arrived here." He added, “it may have
been serendipitous that i came here, but i can’t
think of a place that could have been a better home
for me."
