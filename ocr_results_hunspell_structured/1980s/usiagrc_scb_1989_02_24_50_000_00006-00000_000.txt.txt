Writer condemns
campus graffiti

To tlteedittor.

I‘m writing to condemn those
students reSponsible for the
increased volume of graffiti
present on our campus. This
graffiti overwhelmingly carries
the message: “We are
everywhere," followed by the
symbols for two women and two
men. i find this not only
irresponsible but offensive.
Grinnell College makes access to
paper and copy machines to be
used to promote valid student
groups and to promote activities
upon the campus extremely easy
and I believe that this system
works very well. Walking down
the hall one can see ads for
various Coffeehouses, athletic

IMs, dorm activities. and per-
sonal signs which were made
either from personal paper
supplies or the abundance of
excess paper (que sheets, etc.)
available in the computer areas. 1
am insulted by the attitude that
the commonly accepted rules
adhered to by the vast majority of
our campus community do not
apply to these individuals. These
individuals are fighting to be
accepted as responsible, equal
members of our community (a
fight which I fully support) but
through the irresponsibility of
their actions they appear only to
be hurting their cause. Bruce

Student chides selection
of commencement speaker

To the editor.

The ﬁrst issue of the S and B
stated that Geneva Overholser,
editor of the De: Maine:
Register, will be speaking at
commencement this year. While
I think it is admirable that Ms.
Overholser is “one of the
youngest women in America to
head a major daily newspaper." I
can‘t forget that the “major daily
newspaper” she heads is the Des
Moirtes Register. a publication
that is met with a cenain amount
of scom on this campus. A brief
examination of several recent
Register articles explains why.

For example, look at the
recent front-page story about
lawn ornaments. Twenty~five
percent of Iowans, it seems, have
lawn ornaments, and a full 50
percent think that pink flamingos
and bird baths enhance the
appearance of lawns. l, at least,
now rest easier knowing that the
lawns of Iowa are so tastefully
decorated, and knowing that the
Register is covering this story.

C i a S h '

I‘ve been having a little trouble
putting a handle on things lately. I
can't seem to figure life out. Subr
milled for your approval:
Klansman David Duke won a
state-represenuitivc election in
Louisiana. Some natives are com
plaining that this will make their

fair state the laughing stock of the
nation. Not that that

and other stories that are equally
important.

The Today section also
provides some riveting articles.
In the same issue as the lawn-
ornament story, the Today
section featured an article about
“the magic of electronic bankr
ing,” complete with pictures.
I‘m sure this sensitive and
probing story warmed the hean of
everyone who has ever owned a
Shazam card.

But there‘s more! Consider
the headline “Lesbian Baby
Boom." and the Valentine's Day
story that contained the insightful
quote, “I have research which
shows that women who read
romance novels make love 97
percent more often than woman
who don't. It‘s amazing.”
What's amazing is the Registcr's
inability to use the plural of
“woman" twice in a sentence.

The Register also offers a
column entitled “February Flesh
Watch," which is stupider than

Mike Kent's column. A sample

of Flesh Watch’s witty prose:
“The Cinemax movie
‘Aerobicide’ is the ‘Flesh Watch'
special of the week. It's about
the murders of aerobics‘
instructors at a health spa. A real
jamboree of jiggle." Note the
interesting use of the second
apostrophe in the second senr
tence.

It is beautifully ironic that
the commencement speaker at a
college that emphasizes writing
skills as much as Grinnell does
should be responsible for the
paper that regularly spews forth
such well-crafted sentences as,
“He was not allowed to have
anything with which he could use
to harm himself.” I sincerely
hope that Ms. Overholser can get
an AP writer to. write her
commencement address for her,
instead of having to rely on her
staff writers. Elizabeth

This is also the same state in which

is so high). [wouldn‘t have thought

These people lead ralr
lies screaming for foreigners to get
outot the country (a new twist . ..
I don't recall this as being one of
Adolf’s major campaigns). This
seems pretty much like a fluke,
though, and in West Germany’s
defense, you’d be hard pressed to
find a country that works harder to
prevent any kindoftotalitarian up-
surge.

On the plus side, Lyndon La-
rouche (the bimrre presidential
candidate who believes the Eng-
lish royal family is in cahoots with
the lntemational Monetary Fund
and the KGB to peddle drugs to
Third World countries. . .doesthis

explain the queen‘s lousy taste in
hats?) is going to prison. MoSt of
you probably write Larouchc off as
Small-time stuff (I guess he is), but
here‘s a frightening bit of trivia:
Larouche gotmore votes in 1 1 states
than GaryHartarthaulSimoncom-
bincd. The one drawback of his
being in prison is that we won’t get
to hear as much of his entertaining
gibberish. I suppose we’ll be hear-
ing about his constant appeals and
parole hearings, as we do with
Charles Manson (now THERE’S a
walkingadvertisementforthedeath
penalty).

One last note: is it just me, or
have the films and concerts on cam-
pus been as a rule rather pathetic?
Where was all that democratic input
that, according to last year’s SGA
propaganda, was supposed to go
into film and concert selection? Or
was there plenty ofinput'? In which
case, maybe a re-evaluatton of
democracy is in order. Well, at least
SGA has handcarts for our trip to
hell . . . Oops. they're not here yet.
The order’s been delayed for a few
weeks. They‘ll be here in March for
sure.
