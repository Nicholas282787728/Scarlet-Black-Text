South Africa

and Grinnell

South Africa is quickly approaching a bloody war, a
war that is not being discouraged by U.S. military and
corporate assistance.

And what are we doing here in Grinnell? What is our
connection to the misery in South Africa'.7 Well, we have a
large amount of college funds invested in corporations
active in South Africa. Despite 10 years of growing stur
dent awareness (which culminated in the formation of
the South African Support Group and a number of student
protests several years ago) the college trustees, the peo-
ple responsible for making responsible decisions with our
money, have consistently patronized the SASG and the
majority of the student body. They have refused to take
any action, and instead offered a compromise that com-
promised our sense of intelligence. (I here make
reference to the compromise that followed from the sit-in
of 1982, an agreement to let students vote on “proxy”
resolutions at corporate stockholder meetings, Since
resolutions rarely receive more than 5 percent backing,
however, this is a waste of time. No company will volun-
tarily vote to lose money, and leaving South Africa means
losing of a sourse of profit.)

So, the divestment movement at Grinnell wanes, and

. the trustees wait for just this to happen, after all, they’ll
be here long after any one of us is gone. They can afford
to wait it out.

However the people of South Africa cannot wait any
longer. Our dearly beloved corporations are contributing
to die legitimacy of the government, the propagation of
the status quo, and the agony of the 23 million black South
Africans.

The people of South Africa are struggling for their sure
vival, they live in decrepit huts in remote barren villages
on the outskirts of the country. These shanty towns are
called bantustans. The bantustans house close to 75 per-
cent of the people on 13 percent of the land, the most bar-
ren, least productive of land.

With the generous help of IBM, Ford, GM and several
oil companies, the brutal South African government and
military keep all blacks in check by means of the
passbook system and through brutal repression of free
speech and peaceful protest.

Needless to say, South African blacks do not have the
right to vote, nor me right to assemble; they are paid one
fifth the wages of white workers; the majority suffer
from poor living conditions and abominable health care;
the infant mortality rate is one of the highest in the world.

At the heart of the latest struggles in South Africa are
the fake electoral reforms being offered as a supposed
step toward easing apartheid. In truth, the so-called
reforms are an attempt to solidify and prolong apartheid
by dividing classes and races of people. The “reforms”
offer nothing to blacks and only a false glimpse of power
to Coloreds and Indians.

The protests that have mushroomed since last month’s
restricted “election" are more intense than anything the
country has experienced since the 1976»77 Soweto upris-
ing, and so is the repression. Police bullets have killed
over 40, by “official count" (the actual amount is pro-
bably much higher), but the actions a including gasoline
bomb counterattacks ~ have only grown larger and more
numerous. “Today the people are throwing petrol bombs
at the police; later they will throw grenades,” remarked
African National Congress (ANC) spokesman David
Ndaba.

Last month, in the latest manifestation of “construe
tive engagement,” the U.S. abstained on an overwhelm-
ingly passed UN resolution condemning South Africa’s
constitutional changes, and defended the reforms as a
progressive step. This stance was not seriously challeng-
ed by the media or, with the exception of the forces mat
backed Jesse Jackson, by the Democrats. Once again,
the importance of independent, grassroots organizing
against apartheid was underscored.

With an understanding of humanity, a raising of cone
sciousness, and a little more attention to the importance
of investor responsibility, perhaps our trustees can do
something about the misery of South Africa, perhaps we
can divest before there’s nothing left to invest in.

Divestment is a step in the right direction. Admittedly,
it is a small step in the big picture, but it is an important
step for Grinnell. .

‘Grounds for thought’

or //
k\. .1

by Ellen Weinstock

There are several basic groups
of reasons why people came to
Grinnell Some people came here
because they couldn’t get into the
ivy League, but wanted to go
somewhere “good". Others got ill~
to the Ivy League, but couldn't af-
ford it and got more aid here
Then there's a large contingent
who thought it would be a neat
idea to go to a small liberal arts
college. And there are some of us
who Just got smitten with the
place for one or another reason.
very often the combination of
challenging academics and a
relaxed atmosphere.

it is this last group which is lin-
ding itsell in jeopardy at Grinnell
of late. The decision has been
made that academics here just
have to get tougher if we're going
to keep our share of the market in
a time where the collegerage
population was born alter the
baby boom. The shortage or
students to fill all the spaces
created by the larger generation
before us has colleges scrambling
to stay open or to stay at capacity,
and Grinnell's Solution to the pro-
blem is to get a tougher reputa-
tion. .

So, we lost the “buffer days"
before finals lalthough the monr
thly calendar somewhat sarr
castically lists the weekend before
finals as ”buffer days”), That
leaves a lot of people racing to
finish term papers and study for
finals at the same time. To further
the irony, a dilierent campus ole
fice puts out posters on relieving
stress by realizing one's owti
limits, taking time to relax. eating
well. and so forth (but wouldn't we
rather have a bit more lime than
take a bubble bath to relieve
stress?l.

Now, one hears that tutorials
are being graded, and not even
with a pass/tail option No onc
seems to have any recollection or
this being debated anywhere. and

made rather abruptly, stnee these
freshmen were not warned in the
catalog. A lot of people have lond
memories of their tutorials as
something they found challenging
and were glad to have taken, but
say that they would have felt ex-
tremely pressured to be required
to take such a course and be grade
ed, It’s also somewhat outrageous
that this was merely slipped by
the students, liguring that the up-
perclassmen wouldn't care
because their tutorial days were
through. That's not the Grinnell
way of doing thingsl

The core curriculum debate
seems to have died at least a tem-
porary death since the faculty's

To the Editor:

The Intramural League is an c>tr
lremely good program which
gives those people with athletic inr
clinations the chance to par-
ticipate in sports without he full
obligations and responsibi ties of
belonging to a varsity or JV team.

There are, however. many
students who do not wish to par
ticipate in the Intramural pro»
gram and tar that reason receive
verbal abuse and harassment
from many members of their hall.
For many people football and socr
cer are not fun and other students
