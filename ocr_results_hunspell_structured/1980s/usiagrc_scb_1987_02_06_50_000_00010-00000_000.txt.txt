"I felt sure we'd Come home with two
wins. and instead, we ended up with two
losses," Fairchild lamented, “Our offense
Just tell apart. and our shooting was way
0“. When we did positive things like ﬁnally
getting into position on rebounds. the ball
would roll off our players and out—ot-

weekend."

“We've beaten them once already. so
we know we Can do it." said Coach Fair-

time, then hopefully we can beat them
again. But it’s always hard on their home
court.”

maining. the women look forward to retur-
ning home to Darby Gymnasium tor
rematches against Coe. Monmouth and
Knox. beginning next Wednesday.

“Hopefully we have our bad games out
of the way.” remarked Fairchild. “NOW,
we have to leave those behind us and con-
centrate on what lies ahead."
