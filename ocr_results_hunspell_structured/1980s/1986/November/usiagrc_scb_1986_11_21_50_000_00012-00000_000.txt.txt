London banks We once attempted to send
our rent to our landlady by mail. since we
would be away for Fall Break when she
came around to collect It, _

It seemed feasible at the time, so I walk-
L‘rl into the bank dD\\n the street. set our
nuincy on the counter. and asked ior a
bankers dl‘alt Tile teller looked at me od-
dlv. and asked if I had an account with
lhem. Well, no." I said. and began to ex
plain again that all I wanted was a cci:
tilled check,

i-lis iacc took on a very pained expres-
sion. He sighed. and informed me that
"we only give a banker's drait to an ac
count holder. because it is a sign that we
know the customer personally. trust them
implicitly and can vouch ior their tinancial
character."

"What's to trust?" I asked, displaying
no ﬁnancial character whatsoever. “I
give you the money, you give me a check,
and everyone’s happys Na problem " But
I could see by his iace that it was already a
lost battle; l was up against The Way
Things Are. and had no possiblilty oi gets
ting anywhere using logic and common
sense.

Our only positive bureaucratic ex-
perience has been with the British Natural
Gas Company The men who came to reset
our coin-operated meter last week
discovered .that it was, inexplicably. 4.44
short. when we asked ii ive needed to pay
him. he shook his head. “They’ve got lots
or larger debts to worry about; they'll
never notice yours." .

We smiled and thanked him and he winks
ed in conspiracy: “Just don’t leave the
country."

they had singles,”

“What about this dorm's wild reputas
tiun; earlier in the year at least?"

"That was mostly the freshmen getting
away irom home and getting drunk. 1
think. But that's settled down now "

Dibble Second has study breaks once a
week. which they all take turns doing The
most unique one so [air has been the “Dib-
ble/Grinnell Country Club Golf Course
Study Break, with drinks at every hole."
Pretty lormidable when you consider that
the country club course has eighteen holes

I mosled on up to third floor to 569 if I
could ﬁnd a freshman Wllllng to comment
since treshmen constitute the majority oi
the dorm I went up to the iirst two guys I
happened to see there. Brant Heise and
Danny Zion

“No. sorry, we're sophomores What do
you Want to talk to freshmen for?” They
helpfully directed me down the hall to a
room belonging to Tim Grossman. who
WAS land still is. I assumel a treshmali.
"I was sort oi disappointed to gel stuck in
an all-male dorm at first. but we make our
own fun."

“Yes Danny said "We don't like rap
music" At this remark. I heard a VDICC
say “As a matter 0i fact. we DETEST rap
music.” and Todd Burchert. the 8A,, ap-
peared irom his room as u by magic. This
scemed to be a general consensus among
the guys i was standing with. “especxally
at ninethirty on Sunday mornings."

The guys tried to think oi Juniors or

They all grinned and looked around at

we're bored."

Proteus to Perform

by Susan Prout and Kristen Brown

Have you ever seen a group oi normal
people suddenly transiorm into parts oi
machinery? Have you ever seen Molly
Bentley play God. holding up the world?
Have you ever seen two Chem lab partners
passionately playing with “red gunky
stuff?" Do you want to? ll so, you can see
all this and more at the Proteus periors
mance in South Lounge at 4:30 Friday,
Nov. 21:

You may be asking yourseli, “What is
Proteus?“ Proteus is Grinnell’s lms
provisational acting group. named alter a
Greek god oi the sea who was able to
transiorm his appearance at will,

People join Proteus for many diiierent
reasons. According to co-leader. Ken
Jacobson. “Some do it because they are
serious actorsr others yoin Proteus because
they want to try out this thing called
actingssand improvisation is the basis for

acting," Many oi the members will say it
is an outlet or a release Zorikh Lequldre
explained, “It there's something I feel I
really want to do and I just don't {eel like
getting up on the salad bar and doing it,
Proteus is one of the few places 1 can do
mi:

The members are constantly challenged
by instant characterization of different
roles. They must be able to create spons
taneously new characters convincing to
the audience. They have no time to think
about the situations they are given, they

must simvlv act.
Along with this Friday's periormance,

they plan to put on shows at study breaks
throughout the year. They hold regular
rehearsals on Monday. Wednesday. and
Thursday at 4:15 p m in Fine Arts And
also. many oi the Proteus members attend
