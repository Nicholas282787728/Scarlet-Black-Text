On a cold November Saturday last week
the Grinnell football team played Mon-
mouth under a steelrgray sky. The mood or
the day was perhaps a ioreshadowing ol
the outcome at this particular contest. As

grasp. Such was the nature of small Col-
lege athletics on this particular iall day.

Monmouth came into town sporting a
strong team that bore a striking
resemblance to Ohio State. They claimed
to be a much improved team over last year
and proceeded to prove it on the iield,
where it counted In fact. Monmouth has
given Conference powerhouse Coe a
tougher game than anyone else they have
played. Monmouth stopped Grinnell on
their first possession and then took the ball
and moved down the field for a score, 74y

Grinnell took the ensuing kickoff and
proceeded to move it down the field and
tied the game at 7-7 onJimmy Weiand’s
pass to slotback Mick Maclean. After this
it was all Monmouth until a small band of
guerilla tans decided to infiltrate enemy
territory and reappropriate their obnoxr
ious cannon ior better use, But seriously,
Monmouth took over on the field and went
on to score. In fact, of the final six
touchdowns or the game. Monmouth had
SIX of them. The final score was 4&7.
Highlights oi the game were several hook
and lateral plays run by Martinek and the
exceptional punting oi Scott Stauiter.
