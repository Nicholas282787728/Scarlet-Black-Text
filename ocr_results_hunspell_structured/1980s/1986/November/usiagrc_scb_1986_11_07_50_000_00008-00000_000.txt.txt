THE RETURN or TI-IE JEDI is the see
quel to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.
which was the sequel to George Lucas’
1976 box-office smash, STAR WARS. In
this episode, we rejoin Luke (Mark Hamil)

and Leia (Carrie Fischer), Cr3P0 and‘

RZrDZ, Han and Chewie and the whole
gang as they light back aiter their
devastating losses in EMPIRE, (Luke
especially had a rough time of it; you may
recall helost his hand in the climacticlight
saber fight with Darth Vadar during which
Vadar told Luke that he was destined for
the dark side because he, Vadar, was
Luke's real father)

of course Luke relected the dark side
and went back to his friends, but now the
rebel forces certainly have their work cut
out for them. Not only is Han Solo (Hare
rison Ford) still trapped in a huge black
slab lthe result of highrtech carbon freez-
ing), but the evil empire is already
building another ominous death star which
must be destroyed beiore it gains opera-
tional power.

The plot is all-too familiar (save the
good guys, blow up the bad guysl. but who
ever watched a STAR WARS movie for
plot? The special effects are as good as
ever. particularly during the chase scenes
on ilying motorcyclerlik'e vehicles zipping
through huge forests (one can get QUITE
dizzy) and the fight scenes when the lasers
make for a great light show.

JEDI also introduces some new
characters including Jabba the Hut, a
wonderiully slimy creation with his
sadistic Muppetesque sidekick, and ot
course the Ewoks. the most obnoxiously
cute creatures to land on Saturday morn
ing cartoons since the Smurfs. Alter a
while you get used to cutsiness and can
tolerate their antics. lI have to admit. I
like their war maneuvers.) We also ﬁnally
meet the evil emperor, Darth Vadar’s
boss. who looks periectly horrid and
makes Vadar look as harmless as a kitten.

The real problem with this film is its
treatment of Vadar. The overdose of sweet
syrupy saccharine is nearly iatal If you
can ignore that, though, it’s definitely a
iun iilm and certainly great escapism.

Watching “Return of the Jedi" is like
watching a tworhour commercial for stuff-
ed animals, The movie sells itself by bom~
barding the audience with an array oi
special eiiects In scene aiter scene. fuzzy
bears and mechanical trash dart about
the screen at lightning speed as if to re-
mind the audience to run out to the nearest
mall and gleeiully purchase the entire line
oI Chewbacca party accessories. George
Lucas must have received a bonus from
the toy company for creating the Ewoks, a
tribe oi bears so disgustingly cute that
they induce a love~hate reaction, Personal-
ly. I gain a great degree of joy when a
mechanically incompetent Ewok splat-
ters his space bike into a misplaced Reds
wood tree, Perhaps such devious pleasure
is only a nervous reaction — an attempt to
deal with this high-tech Muppet
shenanigan. All the characters made
iamous by their toy replicas ~ Yoda.
Princess Leia, and Jabba the Hut 7 seem
lost in hyperspace, Yoda offers pseudo-
intellectual advice rivaling the grailiti on
the bathroom stalls at Hurling; Princess
Leia (Carrie Fischer) shows off her age in
a bikini that could only seduce the hookah-
smoking Jabba the Hut, Furthermore,
most of the extra alien riflrraff appear
animated ~ some portrayed by salivating
old men. while others look like taxidel'mic
horror stories

“Return of the Jedi" is clearly an at
tempt to present the viewer with the most
specml effects for his or her $5. However.
in doing so, whatever magic created in the
original “Star Wars". dies a tragic death.
For a $32 million movie. the editing ap-
pears amaturish and Stevie Wonder could
probably have done a better Job with the
lighting. Art Director Joe Johnston ad-
mits, "The public demands a special ei-
iects extravaganza. something that will
blow them away ior their so. We were
never sure if the movie was a vehicle for
the effects or the story," In short, "Return
oi the Jedi" is like cheap champagne — the
pop oi the cork only leads to the taste oi
sugared down drool

‘ Kayaanisqatsi

by Kevin O‘Prey

KOYAANISQATSI. loosely translated. is
the Hopi Indian word for “Life out or
Balance " Director Godirey Reggie incorr
poraics a myriad oi iniluences 7 Hopi Ins
dihns to theologian/philosopher Ivan llr
lylch e to create a moving film indicating
modernity as the nadir oi natural develop-
ment KOYAANISQATSI merges
mesmerizing visual imagery (from the
camera oi Ron Frickei with a powerful
score by composer PHilip Glass

T-hel’ilm opens with flames that suggest
the creation of the earth. These images
evolve into pristine shots oi an American
southwest that has escaped the touch of
human hands Interlaced with slow mo-
tion, time lapse. and last action
photography, the film advances irito
modernity with the turning wheels oi road
graders and tractors on strip mines. Here
the intercourse between visual and aural
sensations becomes overpowering. Reggio
takes the viewer on a tour through the hide
den character of the society that has built
cities up from the ground. In one scene — a
slow close-up on a fighter pilot standing
proudly in iront of his jet 7 he shows the
viewer his definition of hubris. Other
scenes share this )uxtaposition oi the
human and the physical world he/she has
created. The night photography of cities
such as New York and Chicago, in par-
ticular. is beautiful to the point of obscur-
ing the message.

It the philosophy here is at opposition
with your more materialist tendencies, see
this film for its moving visual and aural
work. The camera work and editing is. at
various times. both hallucinatory and in-
spiring. Philip Glass' soundtrack is a grip-
ping and ominous iorce. in the end,
KOYAANISQATSI is an entirely entertain-
ing iilm,

Girl Shy g

by Georgia Dental
GIRL SHY (1924) is another oi the

restored print Harold Lloyd comedy iilms, ,g

with a specially created musical score and
sound effects.

In GIRL SIIY, Harold is a tailor's apr
prentice who is trying to get a collection oi
his fantasies published. At first deiected,
he gives up; out then successiul, he
furiously pursues a rich girl and. in one oi
his iunniest and most daring chase se-
quences, he rescues her irom marriage to
the wrong man.

According to TIME magame. “This is
not only the iunniest picture that I-Iaroid
Lloyd has done [note that SAFETY LAST,
Lloyd's classic film. came out later in
1924]. out pretty nearly the iunniest that
anybody amvhcre has done."

Drop everything and go see KOYAANIs
QATSI! It‘s not foreign and it doesn‘t have
subtitles. you don't even have to know how
in pronounce Koyaanisqalsi lcoyronrlss-
cot~see> In fact the title is the only word in
the whole film. The title is Hopi lndian for
"life out of balance". but this film is well
balanced between the racinaling pictures
and the excellent soundtrack.

The movie is all film with no characters
and no narration. It takes you through im-
ages of nature and civilization. some sped
up and some in slow motion. It shows you
clouds, ocean waves. cars, public squares.
and generally liie, yet it manages to send a
poweriul message. The iilm makers draw
parallels between seemingly unrelated
things as waves and clouds, This is filming
and editing at its best and the pictures are
well lit to the stirring music.

There is nothing in this film that is the
least bit boring. It's art without being art~
sy. All it requires oi the viewer is to sit and
watch as the film makers show’ you the
world as you have never seen it before. I
promise you will enjoy it.
