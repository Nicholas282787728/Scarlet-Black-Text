The Mideast

Pointing Fingers ‘
on the West Bank Cycles of Hatred

The West Bank is often discussed bet-
ween two sides each with finger extended.
One side points to the Israelis and says:
“Give to the Palestinians that which is
rightiully theirs." One side points to the
Arab word and asks: “Why have you abans
doned your own people?” And in between
these accusing positions remains a people
without a home, without a spokesperson,
and without very much hope. Extremists
oiier easy solutions. A variety oi Arab
leaders propose driving lsrael into the
sea; Meir Kahana and his party propose a
Similar end for the Arabs living in Israel;
between these extremes decision makers
scrutinize the intricacies of viable peace
plans. .

I write now to the concerned Americans,
sometimes called the new left, who have
gravitated to the West Bank issue as an
emblem or human injustice, This is a plea
to those who perceive the issue as a clear
moral dilemma between Palestinians and
Israelis. This is a request that concerned
Americans reserve moral outrage until
they have grappled with the complexities
inherent to the Palestinian cause.

It is true that there are infringements of
human rights and that instances of ter-
rorism have occurred in the Wat Bank. In
response the concerned Israeli has pror
tested and demanded that their govern»
ment account for injustices The Israeli
government has also publicly denounced
all Israeli terrorism occurring in the West
Bank and continues to stand boldly for
human rights as it searches ior a solution
in the West Bank, An example of this oc-
‘curred in July of 1985. Thirteen Israeli ter-
rorists were tried and many given lite
sentences for terrorist activities in the
West Bank. Those tried were prominent
army oiticers and West Bank pioneers
This action was supported by Israel’s
military law demanding that each soldier
be held accountable for his actions; he
cannot justify terrorist action or blame it
on a superior. Israel's public announce-
ment oi guilt in regard to terrorism coupl-
ed with due conviction of national heroes
was an action demonstrating Israel’s con-

tinued commitment to' human rights,
justice, and law.

As was mentioned earlier, the
Palestinans in the West Bank stand silent
without an oiiicial spokesperson. The only
member oi uie Arab world speaking ior
them are the PLO. The PLO has claimed
responsib ty tor West Bank advocacy as
easily as they claim responsibility for terr
rorlst attacks. I wonder if the Palestinian
parents and children living it the West
Bank would condone the murder of Israeli
parents and children [or the sake of land.
If Jordan opened its borders to the
reiugees, would the Palestinians go therei
It Israel gave the entire West Bank to the
Palestinian people would they be
satisfied?

It has been said~that the PLO defends the
rigth of the Palestinians to live in the
West Batik. It has been argued as well that
the PLO is using the Palestinian cause to
undercut the existence of Israel instead of
working for a positive solution to the pro
blems on the West Bank. If they cannot
physically drive Israel into the sea as was
promised upon Israel's birth in 1943, then
what better way to destroy the country
than to unchallenge its morality, Israelis
tormented by unreal inflation and
unemployment. Add to that a potential
security problem and some human rights
questions and the country is divided from
within

The israeli people are hurting today,
Most citizens are not blind to the plight oi
the Palestinian neighbors. They can em-
pathize with a feeling of homelessness;
Jews remember when after World War II
every country, including the U 3. closed its
doors. The Israeli people want peace with
their neighbors and peace in the country,
But they also know what it feels like to
raise children in bomb shelters and to lose
children in battles and on ambushed school
busses, The Israeli citizen holds their
government responsible to protect human
rights and to eradicate israeli terrorism
where it manifests itself. And when there
are incidents when a PLO attacks an
israeli town or shopping center or school,
the Israeli military will retaliate against
PLO military outposts.

I write to concerned Americans who are
morally outraged by the Palestinian
cause. It is time to recognize the complex»
ities of this issue.

While all attention In recent months has
been focused on crises such as the Philips
pines, Libya. and Nicaragua, the continu»
ing conflict in the Middle East, for the mo-
ment, has left the international spotlight.
Perhaps the Middle East has lost its vogue
as a problem area because it seems to lack
any readily attainable resolution.

Since the Seven Day War in 1973, the
question ol the israeli occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip has exacerbated the
already volatile Arabrlsraeli conflict, The

Palestinian Liberation Organization
(PLO) and its Arab allies on one side have
demanded that the lsraelis surrender the
occupied territories, At the same time, the
PLO denies that the state of Israel
possesses a legitimate right to exist. The
israelis, ior their part, will not negotiate
with the PLO until it recognizes UN
Resolution 242 which would entail Arab aCs
ceptance oi the legitimate existence oi the
state oi lsrael and an end to violence.
Major gains in the ArabeIsraeli peace
process were made in the U.S.-mediated
bilateral negotiations between lsrael and
Egypt. Through the commitments oi

The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict is
well described by both of the above exprese

' sions From the period surrounding the

creation of Israel, and continuing to this
day, bloodshed has stained the soil of the
Middle East Both parties, motivated by
strong emotions, have had their reason
skewed. They are too closely involved in
the conilict to recognize that the reasons
for their conflict lie in mistakes and
misperceptions in both parties

instead. they put the blame tor the pro:
blems of the Middle East on the other side,
and believe that they are justified in at-’
tacking the other when the other un»
justifiably attacks them, The existence of
these beliefs on both Sides is What has kept
Arabs and Israelis lighting for as long as
they have.

The causes of Middle Eastern bloodshed
have their roots in the end of the 19th cen-
tury, At that time, Palestinians living in
what is now Israel felt threatened by
Jewish settlers, who were beginning to
enlarge the Jewish communitv in
Palestine. Upon whom should we lay
blame. On the Jews, tor not being
more sensitive to Palestinian concerns"
Or on the Palestinians, ior not being more
understanding toward Jewish settlers’.Y
Israelis will claim that Jewish settlers
never threatened the Palestinians, and
that the Palestinians, without provocation,
attacked the Jews. Arabs will claim that
Jewish settlers wanted a state of their own
from the start, and never intended to be
understanding toward the Palestinians.

Both Sides will Site historical evidence
backing up their points of view. But the
biased evidence of either side, is irreles
vant. In any conflict between two parties,
both share a portion of the blame, This is
an indisputable fact about human nature.
To those who raise the question “What
about Hitler? World War II was entirely
his fault," I respond uiat the harsh peace
terms imposed by the West alter World
War 1 were the primary impetus ior the
rise of Hitler. Any other conﬂict will bear
Similar analysis. Historical evidence that
purports to the contrary is simply biased.

In 1982. Israel invaded Lebanon. Why?
Because fighters of the Palestinian Liberas
tion Organization were shelling Northern
Israel. Why was die PLO doing that?
Because Israeli jets had bombed Palesti-
nian targets prior to the invasion. why did
Israel bomb the PLO? Because Israel's
ambassador to Great Britain was shot, by
the PLO, Said Israel.,. It is impossible to
blame the violence on one side The history
of violence will lead the historian around a
vicious circle oi everrescalating Violence.
emanating irom the original problem,
Palestinians having ielt threatened by
Jews.

Indeed, the continued violence has much
exacerbated the problem, to the point
where Palestinians, embittered at having
lived under israeli mi tary occupation, at
having lived in Palestinian reiugee camps.

or at having known a Victim killed or
maimed by israeli iorces during the many
years of War, are willing to strike out, as
terrorists, at any symbol of Israel. Israelis
have similar feelings toward Palestinians.

The embitterment at the continuation of
the conflict is long and deep, It will be by
no means easy to resolve. But resolution of
conﬂict, letting bygones be bygones, is in
the realm oi possibility, as was
demonstrated when Anwar Sadat and
Menachem Begin signed a peace treaty in
Camp David With the aid of President
Carter in 1977. The United States can again
be instrumental in bringing peace, but on-
ly ii it acts as an impartial mediator. Un-
iortunately, our present policy is so impar-
tial, that such mediation is impossible.

The United States brands Yasser Arafat,
leader of the PLO, and Moammar
Khadaly, leader of Libya terrorists. At the
same time, we give huge sums of military
aid to Israel, which it uses to attack Arabs.
I do not defend Arab terrorism, but I
strongly object to the United States aiding
Israel when it reigns terror on Arabs,
while condemning Arabs for reigning ter-
ror on Israel,

The problem is that we, as a nation, have
made the grave mistake of looking at the
Middle Eastern conﬂict through Israeli
eyes, Worse still, through our support of
Israel, we have become a part of the Mid-
dle East conflict, As a result, Americans
are now as much a target of terrorists as
Israelis are.

What bothers me is that the Reagan Ad
ministration and much of the country,
rather than reasonably asking ourselves
why our airplanes are being bombed, our
citizens are killed, and our military iorces
are being attacked, have instead made our
policies on the basis of unreasonable emo-
tion. We are mad at those who have attacks
ed us, and so we have returned their at-
tacks with attacks oi our own. But worse
than merely acting on feelings of anger,
we think our actions will actually reduce
terrorism! If we thought about the pres
blem, and realized that terrorists attack
Americans out oi rage toward an
American policy mat only sees one side oi
the story, we would see that American
counterattacks do nothing more than aug-
ment the Arab rage. We thus enter the eye
cle of violence.

I wish we in the United States would look
at the problems in the Middle East with the
same enlightened eye with which we view
the problems Within our country. Take, for
example, inner city crime, We recognize
that the reasons for higher crime rate in
poor areas of inner cities is that social con-
ditions there are so bad, that young people
do not receive the proper guidance and
support to lead productive lives, We punish
those who commit crimes because we do
not want to encourage the criminal
lifestyle, but we recognize that putting
young criminals in jail is not the real
answer to crime, The real answer is in ims
proving the social conditions in inner
cities. The analysis of the problem is the
same for the Middle East conflict.
Whereas those Arabs ,who commit tere
rorist actions should be condemned, (as
should the Israelis when they attack) the
