The Seventh Seal

By Kevin O'Prey

Written and directyed by lngmar
Bergmann, this 1958 tilm is a powertuliy
moving Search tor the meaning of the
human on Earth. Set in pestilence-ridden.
14th century Europe, a knight (Max Von
Sydow) returns trom the Crusades only to
encounter the hooded tigure ot death on a
lonely beach. The two engage in a game oi
chess. thereby buying the knight time in
avoiding his fate. While the game is
played, the knight. disillusioned by the
crusades and the human bestiality he
Witnesses all around him, sets out to iind
some meaning in a miserable world.
Although the world he sees is depressed
and awaiting the apparently approaching
Day oi Judgment. Von Sydow ultimately

encounters hope and meaning admidst the
rum.

THE SEVENTH SEAL is a morality
play andwan allegory to Bergmalin's per
sonal Search tor God and meaning in the
late twentieth century, The knight is any
human laced with the looming possibility
ul lhe apocalypse (nuclear war. a Pub-less
Grinnellt or Whatever). Although the text
here is essentially intellectual. Bergmann
has created a visually moving and
beautiful iilm, His brilliant use of express
sionism and abstraction marks him as olie
oi the great directors in in cinematic
iiistory Go see it, it's good

Check your brain at the door, put your

Alan Arkin and Peter Falk.

The mayhem all starts when Arkin's
daughter and talks son announce their

torthcnming marriage. It quickly
escalates as Arkiii, a mild-mannered dens
tist. gets sucked into a wild CIA plot in»
voiving U 5. Treasury plates and the oven
throw ot a Central American country
governed by a looiiey dictator who talks
through his alter-ego handspuppet. The
movie culminate; hilariously as Arkin
tries toverishly to hold on to the last
threads or his sanity

stayed on syndicated late-night television
with his trenchcoat and his cigars
