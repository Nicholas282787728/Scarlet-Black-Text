Griffins Destroy
’ Drake

hy lilair Dmison

The Griffin's first road game proved to
be a romp, the Grinnell men came waltz-
ing home after beating the Drake Law
School club 42 0

The first 15 minutes ot the game did not
indicate the iorthcoming victory Captain
and serum half David Klaiman was not
impressed with the back s passing; he
described the Whole team s play in those
first plays as some or the worst rugby he
had seen.

The Griffins settled down, though, allows
ing junior Mike Shanley to score on his
first try. This was quickly followed by four
points .lrom another junior, Joe Cuilnr
ingham.

Mike MacLean scored his first of three
trys at the end of the first half MacLean s
was a penalty try. The penalty 'try was
granted after Drake fouled senior Phil
Heidemann on what would have been a
successful attempt.

The second half proved to he a scoring
bonanza tor the Griffins. Freshman Greg
Pringle. like Shanley, was a tirst time
scorer. Joining Pringle we‘re Cunningham,
and MacLean and Heidemann with two
trys each.

Phil Heidemann ran 7o yards for one of
the most spectacular trys of the game.

The only possible factor holding Grinnell
back last Saturday was the absence of
their regular kicker. Drew ihach. Taking
over Ibach‘s duties were Klaiman. Joe
Phipps. and Chris Bain.

After such a successful outing last
weekend, the Griffins should be in fine
form for their trimeet this Saturday. The
crinnell club will travel to Lamoni, Iowa
to play at Graceland College.

Prospects are good fur defeating both
the Graceland and Newton clubs, “If we
play to our potential, we should win," said
Captain Dave Klaiman,
