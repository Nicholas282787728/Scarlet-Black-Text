Nicaragua:
N0 Parasan

Not on the April calendar, this recent
documentary locuses on the continuing
crisis in Central America, The ﬁlm's
reiusal to gloss over the less attractive
aspects of the Sandinista regime makes it
all the more cllective in puncturing some
or the lavorlte ioreign-policy iantasies ol
the Reagan administration 7 he, that
Nicaragua, as part oi the worldwide Com»
munist conspiracy, poses a grave threat to
us, “security."

Australian documentarian David Bradr
bury‘s approach is iucidly analytical and
at the same time intensely dramatic.

NICARAGUA: NO PARASAN will be
shown on Thursday, May I, at 930 pm. in
ARH. — D.L.

‘ 7Hearts and Minds

This incredibly powerful. chilling
documentary iocuses on American in
volvemenl in the Vietnam War. Directed
by Peter Davis, the lilm contains graphic
{outage or the war eiiorl, along with inter
views with many burned-out, brutalized
Vietnam Veterans.

Yet HEARTS AND MINDS goes deeper
than this, by showing how the American in
volvemenl' reflected deeper values and
assumptions of American culture. Indeed.
the film includes interviews with such
American policymakers as Eugene
Rostow and Daniel Ellsberg.

Admittedly, the film does take some
cheap shuts, yet as one former antirwar
protester. Professor Hielala. commented,
it is “Still the most powerful documentary
about the Vietnam War." HEARTS AND
MINDS will be shown on Monday, April 28,
at 9:30 in ARH. 1974. 110 minutes 7 D.L,

In the Year
of the Pig

A riveting, iniormative and ultimately
moving documentary about American in-
volvement in the Vietnam War. Produced
and directed by Emile de Antonio, who
also did POINT OF ORDER (another part
of the Films of Political Comment series).
YEAR OF THE PIG is a Shattering indict-
merit of American policy in Vietnam and
Southeast Asia. Through a series of
brilliantly edited sequences of stock
lootage, the movie portrays our lying
politicians. and the way in which we
devastated the land, all the while talking
about “peace."

A quality complement to HEARTS AND
MINDS, which together paint a realistic, ii
depressing and maddening picture or an
important era in American history.

IN THE YEAR OF THE PIG will be
shown TUESDAY. April 29. at 9:30 in
ARH. 1969 101 minutes. black and will e. v
