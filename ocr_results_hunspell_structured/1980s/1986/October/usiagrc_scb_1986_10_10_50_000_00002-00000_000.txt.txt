Violence and
Women

By Leslie Wilson

The report oi Attorney General Edwin
Meese’s commission that studied the ef-
fects and role of pornography in the U.S.
was made public this summer. Basically.
the commission claims that “deceptiuns of
sexual activity are linked to an increase in
violence towards women.” The report
itself made no censorship recommenda-
tions but did call for citizen action (such as
boycotting), which has led to many stores
self~censoring their shelves and removing
pornograhpic magazines in order to avoid
such public action.

The main conclusion of the Meese com-
mission linking pornography to violence
against women has been contested by
some people who say that the evidence in
the report is questionable and
misconstrued. One of the main benefits of
the Meese commission's report has been
the increase in public discussion and
awareness of pornography and its the
effects, .

What is pornograpth Gloria Steinem
diiierentiates pornography from erotica
by saying that “ . . , pornography is not
about sex. it’s about an imbalance of
power that allows and even requires sex to
be used as a form of aggression."

Pornography must be recognized as a
degrading and demeaning portrayal of
women in the most vulnerable of situa
tions, There are different degrees and dif-
fering effects of pornography, which range
from the subordination and objectification
or women to physical aggression and
violence. Pornography validates and
legitimizes. ii not encourages, the subor~
dination of women. Pornography’s
message reads that the objectification and
subordination of women and violent acts of
sex are normal and healthy for males; and
that (perhaps most distressing) women
enjoy passivity and violent sex.

The Meese report's claim that por-
nography is a cause of violence towards
women has been debated extensively,
However. it seems quite logical to put forth
this Claim in light of the fact that
psychologists and social scientists have
determined with a high degree oi certainty
that there is a causal relationship between
watching violence on television and being
aggressive. Violent television shows and
movies are very inﬂuential on, if not
primarily responsible for. the increase in
acts of physical violence. So, then, does
pornographyhighly influence the degrada-
tion of women and acts of physical
violence to women.

It is interesting to realize that the in-
herent wrong oi using children in por-
nography is much less contested The
public is willing to admit the demeaning
aspects and violencercausing
characteristics manifested in child pore
nography. Don't these same
characteristics carry over to pornography
as a whole as well?

The presence and acceptance of par-
nography are symptoms oi deeper pros
blems in our society: the male-female con
flict and the subordination of women.
These problems are manifested in

Edwin Meese's Commission Report on
Pornography released this summer is
representative of a new moral military
espoused by the Reagan Administration
and is warm in a growing willingness of
government Officials, from federal to the
local levels, to enforce traditional Values.
An example oi this willingness was seen
this summer as thousands of 7-Eleven
Stores nationwide pulled Playboy and Pen-
thouse from their shelves after receiving a
letter irom ore Attorney General commise
sion suggesting that they may be cited by
the government Commission for
distributing pornography. From a civil
liberties standpoint, the actions and fin-
dings of the commisston’s report pose a
severe threat to all Americans interested
in free speech and responsible govern
ment.

Meese’s report stated that "a casual
relationship does exist between degrading
and sexually violent pornography and
violence toward women.“ Yet, many
members of die panel could not accept the
commissions sweeping generalization,
Commission members Judith Becker,
direction of the Sexual Behavior Clinic at
New York State Psychiatric Institute and
Ellen Lee, editor oi Women’s Day, sharply
rejected the commission’s premise linking
pornography and Violence and wrote an
eighteen page rebuttal noting that “efforts
to tease the current date into a proof of a
casual link simply cannot be
accepted."

Clearly. support for the Meese Commis
sion findings is not overwhelming, In the
words of AL.C.U. lawyer. Barry Lynn,
“the Meese Report is little more than
prudishness and moralizing masquerading
behind social»scientific jargon ” What's
more. the Meese Commision's intimida~

' Pornography and
‘ Grinnell ,

By Bruce J. Emond

in an oftrquoted evaluation of por-
nography. an American judge reportedly
said, ”i know it when I see it.” Picking up
irom subjective definitions such as this,
Attorney General Ed Meese set out in 1985
to determine what pornographic materials
constitute obscenity and its effects on
readers and to propose guidelines to cure
tail the spread of violent porn.

The longrawaited publishing oi the
Meese Commissions’ Report on Por-
nography this June, which linked violent
crimes against women with the depiction
of violent sexual acts in porn magazines
and movies, was championed by some
religious and anti»porn groups as a hen
chmark in their struggle to ban por-
nography, In response to an upsurge in
anti-pornography demonsuatidns, some
national stores, most notably 77Eleven,
pulled Playboy and Penthouse magazines
from their shelves. Conversely. the Report
was criticized by many Civil Liberties face
tions for the apparent antirporn bias of
Commission members (most of whom
have been involved in anti-porn crusades)
and the $500,000 budget used to collect
materials

While it hardly strikes one as a hotbed of
pornography, Grinnell has its supply oi
X-rated video cassettes and porn
magazines. And, like the tussle of opinions
being contested on the national level, the
pros and cons of the porn argument exist in
the town,

In Grinnell, Debbie Danforth, owner of
the Varsity bookstore, noted that the ,
report has had little effect on business
Danforth says the report reﬂects a na-
tional trend to more conservative attitudes
but does not present anything new.

“We stopped getting hardrcore
materials about a year ago because there
wasn’t much market for them anymore,”
said Danforth,

Except for the three big sellers e
Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler _ soit-
core magazines are situated in a “brows-
ing” room which patrons must pay to
enter, Danforth said this routine was
established when hard-core materials
were Carried by the store, but it has been
continued to prevent minors from gaining
access to porn.

“The browsing room also gives people a
choice; it people don't want to be cons
ironted by pornography they don’t have to

e.” commented Daniorth.

Store manager Perry Schold believes
the Meese findings are too restrictive. “We
get just ordinary people who want to look
at the magazines and they don't exhibit
any violence towards women,” Schold ad~
ded that “I've been reading Playboy and
watching X~rated cassettes for 15 years
now and they haven't affected me.”

The magazines on display in the brows-
ing room were predominantly ones of
heterosexual twosomes and ﬂireesomes
but there were also materials with lesbian
couples. albeit intended [or heterosexual
males. and a shelf oriented to gay males.

Danforth stated the store's policy to
refuse any material involving bestiality,
bondage, or children. The magazmes view-
ed had photographs of iellatio. cunr
nilungus, and masturbation, but Schold
said they still qualiiy as softrcore because
“they don’t show penetration."

Shcold and Daniorth defended the right
to sell porn by asserting that laws, and .
restrictions will only succeed in forcing
porn underground. “This is a much better
way because people decide for themselves
whether or not they want to buy skin
magazines," said Schold. He conceded,
though, that Grinnell's Midwestern loca
tion and the small community make porn
difficult to sell. “Grinnell is a very chur-
chy place with only eight thousand people,
so there isn't such a big demand for it
[porn]."

The Cinema Theater has a collection of
over two hundred X-rated vide'os, among
them porn “classics" such as “Deep
Throat." “Debbie Does Dallas," and “The
Devil and Miss Jones.” An interview was
arranged with an employee at the Thea ter,
After the interview was completed and he
had spoken with superiors at the Des
Moines headquarters. the employee
retracted his statements, Efforts were
made to contact Cinema Theater manage-
ment, both through phone calls and by let
ter, but as oi this writing, no reply was for-
thcoming.

“Pornography is like
firearms, you’ve got to
stop it from getting into
the wrong hands.”

Grinnell Clergy expressed universal
condemnation of violent porn and its ex-
ploitation of children and animals. There
were differing opinions on how censoring
oi porn should be imposed and what
materials should be restricted or outlaw~
ed,

Surprisingly, considering the Catholic
Church’s traditionally conservative stance
on sexual issues. the most tolerant view of
porn was held by Father Harry Linnenr
brink of St. Mary’s Catholic Church.
Stating that child porn and bestiality are
”different matters altogether," Linnen-
brink believes there should be an outlet for
mainstream pornographic magazines like
Playboy “for those mature enough to han»
die it.” He qualified this by urging that
porn be kept from children and the mental-
ly ill,

”Pornography is like firearms, you've
got to put some kind of restrictions on it to
stop it getting into the wrong hands,” he
said

Representatives of Grinnell's Baptist
and Episcopal congregations were harsher
in denouncing porn Reverend Robert c.
Smith of the First Baptist Church of Grin-
