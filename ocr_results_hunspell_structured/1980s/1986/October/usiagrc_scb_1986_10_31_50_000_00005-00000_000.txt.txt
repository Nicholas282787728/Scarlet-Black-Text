George A. Romero pulled off this horror
film on a budget or approximately $5.000.
The production, however, plays on its own
rough edges. Romero ﬁlms in black and
white with a heavy emphasis on shadows
and a closed irame to emphasize a trapped
icellng. NIGHT OF THE LlVING DEAD is
a tranSition film: it links the classic 1950's
horror iilm with the type of lilm that would
torture adolescents in the late 70’s and ear-
ly 80’s in one sense it forecasts the coming
trendgory and shocking films on the lines

strength of this film is Romero's

Malcolm Lowry’s UNDER THE
VOLCANO is thought by many to be a
masterpiece. '

Set almost entirely in the protagonist‘s
mind on the day of his fall, this novel prove
ed to be too daunting a task for the Bunuels
and other great directors to tackle, Direc-
tor John Huston and writer Guy Gallo
eventually took Volcano on and have pro
bably done as good a job as one could ex-
pect. There are weaknesses here-but. the
film does a good job to be faithful to the
novel.

UNDER THE VOLCANU takes place in
Cuernavaca on the Day oi the Dead
(November/10. 1938. A newly retired
British Counsil Geoffrey Firmin (Albert
Finneyl is ii; the process or drinking

imposed separation now convinced or her
love for Geoffrey and the need to save him.
The task. however. is formidable. Geofs

and cannot overcome or face his im-
potence as a husband. Aggravating the
situation is the nresenra of Hil- A

had a devastating affair with Yvonne in
the past. Geoffrey cannot come to terms
with ' love for Yvonne and Hugh nor his
inability to lorgive them. in the end. he is
driven further down - taking his loved ones
with him,

As the intellectual alcoholic, Albert Fin-
ney is brilliant. Although the film cannot
venture into his mind, Finney, is superb in
his ability to demonstrate the torrents that
rage within him. Jacqueline Bisset
delivers an excellent performance that is
outof character for many of her screen aps

film. John Huston relies on a simple, clean
portrayal of the plot that is Similar to Hems
mingway. But. not everyone likes Hemm-
lngway. Nor will everyone like this film. It
seems to drag at times, but its hard to
blame them. If nothing else. the parlor
mances of Finney and Bisset make this a
film worth seeing.

Hanging
Rock

Peter Weir's PICNIC AT HANGING
ROCK is another horror film. only this
time set in the Australian Outback. On
Valentine's Day. 1900. a Girls' school
mistress leads several of her students on a
picnic excursion into the outback to a rock
formation known as Hanging Rock. The
girls . all dressed in their flnest outing
clothes and carrying parasols in the torrid
heat - set out from the disciplined/ordered
environment of the school for the
mysterious and primal wilderness. For
reasons unknown, most or this party won't
be coming home. Eventually. only two of
the girls return to civilization . neither of
whom can remember anything that hap-
pened

Basing it on a true story, Peter Weir
(WITNESS. GALLIFOLI) creates a film of
haunting beauty and terror. Using his
melodic visual imagery. Weir emphasizes
the mysticism and primal nature oi the
outback in contrast with the confining
discipline or the Victorian girls school,
Society vs. nature is one of Weir's favorite
themes, it appears prominently here in the
repressed sexuality oi the girls and the
iate of the picnic.

Plays Oct. 31
to Nov. 4

“The Waltz: Etudes for Actors in Three
Quarter Time” is not traditional tare for
Grinnell theatregoers The periormance
is anything but traditional,

Directed by Sandy Mollett, professor ot
theatre, the Grinnell College Theatre pro
duction is scheduled ior 3:00 pm in
Flanagan Arena Theatre in the Fine Arts
Building

A hybrid or process/experimental
theatre, ”The Waltz" takes its inspiration
from improvisation, Waltz music, and
Oscar Wilde's “The importance oi Being
Earnest."

Audiences Should not expect traditional
play structure with a beginning, middle,
and an end, “The production is arranged
as a showing rather than a play,” said
Moffett who conceived the cols
lage/construction, “i hope the audience
will move about during the performacnes
as if they were in a gallery, viewing the
work from differnt angles and different
perspectives, I hope they wrll return again,
it they like, to see parts of it again in still
another way." ,

“The structure will make demands on
the audience that will not be the usual
demands made by a dramatic production,
but more like those made by a concert.” he
explained, Nor will the production build a
dramatic climax. “Often the movement
will seem static, at other times it will
reach a crescendo "

Appearing in “The Waltz” are Rob
Valenti, Ian Roberts, Zorikh Lequidre,
Beth Albrecht. Tracy Zellich, Piney Janik,
and Jenny Jones. Juigen Stein is stage
