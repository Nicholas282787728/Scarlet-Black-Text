Jeff Phelps owns and operates the Main
Street wine Cellar in Grinnell, the area’s
only line wine shop tor miles around

A native Grinnellien, he grew up in the .

typical small Midwestern town environ»
ment, though because his mother worked
on campus he was iniluenced by the
presence oi the College. “I spent a lot oi
time as a kid getting kicked out or the
Forum," he said. Phelps liked the at-
mosphere of the school enough to attend;
he graduated in 1973 Looking back on
those days with a lot oi iondness, he ieels

After working in the hybrid corn division
at Cargill as a research assistant, he “just
kind of l'loundered for two or three months
trying to figure out what to do in Grinnell."
0n the suggestion at a lriend, he began to
think seriously about opening up a line
wine shop in town. especially since the
privatization act of July 1, 1985 made this
possible. He had to learn a lot more about
wines and the necessary business and
marketing techniques, but things came
together last December when he opened

that Grinnell has changed to a degree.
although the academics have remained
strong throughtout. in Phelps' opinion,
some of the social and political awareness
oi the late '6OS and early '705 appears to be
returning to the students, while the College
continues to maintain an excellent balance
or backgrounds and upbringings.

About seven or eight years ago, Phelps
took a trip with his Wife to the Napa Valley
area OI California and saw the “Joseph
Phelps Winery.” He could not resist stayr
ing an extra day tor the tour, and although
he knew little about the process of wine-
making. he was fascinated by it. In the
sampling room he tasted a Johannesburg
Riesling and was amazed at how much dif-
ferent it was from the “Boone's Farm" he
had previously tried, “It was a tremen»
dous bitter disappointment to come back
to Iowa and find that none of the things out
there were available here,” he Said.

Phelps came back to Grinnell because of
a "‘real strong desire to stay in this com-
munity." He has two daughters and finds
the slowerapaced atmosphere a nice en
vironment for raismg kidS.

Phelps expected about hall 01' his

The Wine Cellar now also leatures an ex»

seem more ready to experiment with beer
than wine,

Phelps spoke out against the new Iowa
drinking age. “I just don't think it’s right
to discriminate against people who are 19
and 20 years old," Although the country
has a problem with drinking and driving,
he ieels that raising the drinking age will

Way Out
in London

by Shelley Reid

Dr. Samuel Johnson is oiten quoted in
guidebooks, such as the Grinnell-in-
London Handbook, as saying, “When a
man is tired or London, he is tired at life."
Having spent nearly a month in London, i
am inclined to believe that he was misr
quoted; what he really said was, “When a
man is tired of London. he is tired of
LINES ,, The British call them QUEUES,
to make them sound more important and
dignitied. but this does not change the iact
that the average Londoner spends as much
time standing in line each week as the
average Grinnell student spends putting
on doing his or her homework

it one travels during a rush hour. lor iii-
stance. one can stand in hall a dozen
queues beiore one gets to work tor school i.
There‘s a queue to buy tube tickets. a
queue to go on the escalators. a queue to
get onto the tube. a queue to go up the
escalator, a queue to turn in tube tickets,
and a queue to get out oi the station. There
are queues t'or cheap theatre tickets and
expensive concert tickets: short queues
tor telephones and long queues in markets
tespecially on Saturdaysi people even
queue tor WENDYS hamburgers at lunch
The only things you don't queue tor are
drinking iountains. there ARE no drinking
tountains in London .

Londoners are incredibly patient about
queuing. They don‘t push and shove. or at
tempt to cut in ahead oi you: most oi them
just buy a paper (another queuei and
stand there reading it,

are in this way more inioi-med about cur»

by any means. The headlines in the leading
newspapers oiteii run something like this:
“LIFE WIHTOUT sax: A FIVEVPART
SERIES.” Terrorist attacks and plane
crashes hnd spots on pages two and three;
alter all, one is looking ior something to
take one's mind oil a long queue or tube
ride. not hard news.

Americans who read the NATIONAL
ENQUIRER or STAR MAGAZINE rarely
do so public (inquiring minds may want to
know, but they don:t want anybody else to
know that they Want to know), But It is not
unusual to sit across the tube from a
middle-aged gentleman in a three-piece
suit who is in deep contemplation oi a

paper bearing the headline: “WILL DI BE
FERGY’S SURROGATE MOTHER?” It's
no wonder the British lost. America.

Women who ‘stand in queues have even
more to escape irom than men, i.e., the
condition of their feet, It never ceases to
amaze me that women in London, wearing
pumps with fourainch heels. can run down
three flights of stairs to catch a train and
not even stub a toe. Many of them don't
even wear nylons to help ease the friction.
Having gone through nearly an entire box
of Bandrmds my ﬁrst week here, I am
completely baitled by this immunity to
pain and discomfort. I hear that Oriental
girls used to have their feet bound in an at-
tempt to keep them irom growing. and it
occurs to me lusually very late at night
when my mind begins to wanderi that
perhaps young English girls have their
ieet amputated at the ankle and replaced
with polyurethanecoated plaster molds.
But this is just a theory,
