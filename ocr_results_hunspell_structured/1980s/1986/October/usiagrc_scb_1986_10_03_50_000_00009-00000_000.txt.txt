conventional plav. will he periormed from
October 10th through til at 8 pm. in Arena

Moriett believes that “doing ‘The Waltz'
gives us tthe actors and liimseii) the
chance to go outside oi just taking a script
and producing that play," He says “This
periormance will be by and large created

tion irom improvisation. Waltz music and
scenes and Oscar Wilde's Tiic iiiiportiiiice

"The structure will make demands on the

the movement will seem static. at other
times it will reach a crescendo. there will
be actors speaking simultaneously a

to things like rhythm and tone,"

The director is "approaching this
tpiece) in much the same way as a
sculptor or a painter approaches his
medium," He is trying to create a perior-
mance structured and presented in a novel
fashion. Even the set is unconventional
"The audience will sit on the stage looking
into a box-shaped area created by a scrim,
a light ti'alislusceiit material This will
give the periormance a kind oi misty.

The Poem
as Print

A display consisting oi twentyrt'our
broadsides is now on exhibit iii the Burling
Gallery. A broadside is more than just a
poem printed on paper, “it is typographic
haiku which captures a single lyric mo--
ment when text becomes design." Th!
print, paper, text. and artistic design al
combine to make a statement. The poets
represented in the exhibit include Robert
Bly. Amy clainpitt. Judith
Hemschemeyer. and Radcliffe Squires.

of tlie broadsides. and the editors are Dani”

This is the p esophy behind the recently
released "lowaid" 45. The record jacket
states. "It is the very essence of our
culture that is threatened by the criSis in
the tarm industry. The crisis Will work its
way through every iacet oi our economy.
and we will all lose," The proceeds lrom
the sale of the record will go to Food Bank
oi Iowa and the Iowa Farm Unity Coalie
tion's Farm Crisis i-iotline. but there pro-
bably won't be too much profit.

The first song on the record. “The Farms
ly.” is a mixture of blues. jazz. and (oh.n0)
disco. but as one student remarked. “It
leaves no impression on me whatsoever."
Perhaps one of its fallacies is that it tries
to do too much; apart lrom the usual
guitars. bass, drums. and brass, the song
includes organ, conga, reeds, synth. and a
male quartet. to name a tow

Bob Dylan's version of “Forever
Young" on the flip Side doesn’t {are much
better. As one junior eloquently put it. "It
will not be climbing the charts iii the near
tuture 7 or (or that matter, the future." It
is the kind oi gospel tune that you would
expect to hear on the Barbara Mandreii
show. but because oi excessive vocal parts
and a country twang, it sounds like Merle
Haggard's version at “We Are the World ”
Although the musical virtues of the record
are not plentilul, the cause is worthwhile.
Think of it as an important contribution to
the community.

The
Smiths

By Kristen Stromhci-g

The Smiths’ latest album. “The Queen is
Dead." is detiiiitely their most pop-
oriented eiiort yet. it seems that they. like
so many other bands that started out in the
British underground. have realized that
lame and iortune lie in catchy tunes. This
album (their tourtht is an eas‘ o-listen-to
mixture of ballads and dune able beats.
with singer Morrlsey's monotone voice
droning throughout

The Slriitlis' style. although it is original.
does not leave room {or much variation.
and it is easy to coniuse one song with the
next, Guitarist Johnny Marr plays a good
melody in songs such a "There is a Light
That Never Goes Out and “Cemetary
Gates." houever. which gives the album a
little spice. other enjoyable songs include
"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side” and
"Some Girls are Bigger than Others,"

ltlurrisey. who writes all the lyrics for
the group, vascillates between trying to be
sincere and mcaniiigiul and trying to coin
it tatldish phrase Although some of his
songs are meant to be just ior tun. others
such as ”The Queen is Dead" take a halt
hearted stab at social commentary: "has
the world changed. or have i chaliged7/ as
some 9-year-old peddles drugs/(I ,never
even knew what drugs were) This is
tollowed up _‘ the obscure comment, "but
nhcii you‘re tied to your mother's
apron/no one talks about castration,"

Despite the sarcastic tone oi most or the
songs. the album is not too cynical to be en
joyed by philosophical listeners and bop-
pcrs alike. Although “The Queen is Dead"
is a change aimed at attracting a larger
tollowing tor the group. the direction they
seem to be taking is worth a listen
