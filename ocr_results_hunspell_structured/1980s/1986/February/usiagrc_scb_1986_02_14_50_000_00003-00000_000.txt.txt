The Women
in Blue

by Blair navison

Grinnell dorms might not oiier every
comiort oi home. but then again your
mother isn't nagging you about when the
bathroom is going to be cleaned.

instead. a diligent housekeeping staff
cleans your bathroom, hail. kitchen, and
lounge.

The housekeeping staff IS responsible for
the cleaning o every dorm, classroom
building, or college-owned oiicampus
residence, Monday through Friday. iron. 3
a m. to 5 pm. the housekeepers are charge
ed with the responsibility or cleaning their
designated territory.

A housekeeper's territory can encom-
pass between one and tour buildings. The
typical territory is com rised oi a single
dorm, but one new to t e staff might be
responsible for several collegeenwned
houses. or she might be assigned to a
larger dorm. such as Norris. or a dorm
with an annex, such as Dibble. No matter
what the size oi her territory. each
housekeeper is responsible {or the clean-
ing of the halls, lounges. kitchens, and
bathrooms of each residence.

These duties used to be ranked in order
oi priority, with bathrooms being the
housekeepers' main concern. Now,
however. the goal is to clean as much oi
the assigned territory as possible in one
working day.

One housekeeper. who like all 1 spoke to,
Wished not to be identified, is very
distressed about the lowering of the
bathrooms priority, Noting the health con-
cerns involved. she asserted that the
bathrooms should be the focus of the
housekeeper. Used not only by students.
but by a wide variety oi people including
the housekeeping staff, the bathrooms'
cleanliness is essential to the well being of
the whole campus.

The question of health is one of which the
housekeeping staii is iully aware Some oi
the housekeepers expressed concern in
regard to their working conditions.

The housekeeper works for eight hours a

generally unilattering, and uncomfor-
table.

in tact, the unilorm is a very controver-
sial topic among the staii Every year new
uniforms are purchased by the school.
Each housekeeper receives three
uniiorms; she is expected to wear the
uniform every day so that she will be
highly visible irom a distance and easily
recognizable.

The old uniiorms were 100% polyester;
tnis meant that the housekeepers
pcrspired heavily in the summer. and
were chilled inthe winter. The proposed
new uniforms were to have been a darker,
more attractive color and to have been
made of a higher cotton content that of-
iered more mobility.

Instead. uniforms very similar to the old
ones were chosen. These new uniforms do
possess more cotton. but in poorly and are
the same ugly aqua color.

The new uniform reflects the desire of a
minority of the staff. One housekeeper
related some of the problems she has‘had
with the uniform; on her first day wearing
the pantsuit, a male student told her that
he could see “everything”, adding that the

An American in France

by Lisa Clcarlite

The rain kept pouring down and gusts of
wind threatened to turn my cheap um-
brella inSlde out. Huddling closer to the
cold wall, I looked out at the dark street
again, The busses in Rennes ran inlre»
quently in the evenings and the last one
always took so long to arrive ihad spent
so many cold. hungry eternities waiting
there aiter class each day. What was so
great about being in France anyway?

Narrowsset headlights reflected on the
slick road, Something seemed strange
about them, They were yellow! But cars
are supposed to have white headlights. I
thought. After all, the cars I had seen all
my life had had white headlights But not
so in France.

Incidental discoveries of this kind made

prepared to accept new religious and
political ideologies. but i had never im-
agined to what extent daily liie would dit-

It may not seem important whether
toilet paper comes on a roll or in little
brown squares. The differencc exists
though. and when faced with little brown
squares for tour months, I had to wonder
why even the toilet paper was different.
Were there reasons for these differences?

Every iew minutes, another short paunr
chy Frenchman would pass by on the nar»
row sidewalk and enter the cafe next door.
The same neighborhood men came every
evening at about the same time. I
wandered towards the windows hung with
old yellowed lace and glanced in at the In-
viting light. it only I were one oi these old
guys and ii dinner were not waiting at
home...

An older woman joined me at the bus
stop. I wondered, should I venture to speak
with her? it was surprisingly diiiicult to

than my host iamily. The French are retie
cent with strangers and strongly value
personal privacy Still. i knew older
women like to pass the time oi day. My
boredom and desire to practice my French
pushed me towards her. She was at first
surprised at being addressed. but was

friendly when she learned that I was an
American student.

I had found that once a conversation was
started. people were usually interested in
speaking with an American, My heart rac-
ed a bit as I struggled to comprehend the
woman’s questions

My Small conversational vocabulary
limited the complexity oi my responses,
Wrestling with the language each day was
a challenge. Most of the time. it was a fun
game. But it was like having a handicap;
and well developed thought was always
reduced to fit my elementary control of the
language. i quickly got used to ieeling
dumb.

The bus suddenly rounded the corner
and pulled to a stop before the cafe, I was
relieved at this chance to graceiully end
our conversation and hurried to find a seat

business,

When Iliad first arrived. this lack of
smiles depressed me. I had wanted to
shake someone and say, "Look, smiling
does not hurt!” But I got used to the lack of
smiles too.

A day earlier. 1 had seen a man grinning
to himself and had caught myself thinking
that he must be a lunatic. Was I already
becoming acculturatedt

I rested my head against the window and
stared out at the small buildings which line
ed the streets. These daily bus rides were
not the most enjoyable times I had in
Fiance, but they were the most special to
me, I liked being an anonymous observer,
immersing myseli in a culture so diiierent

I had many wonderful times in France.
traveling to see beautiiul sights. eating
fine cuisine. and meeting interesting peo-
ple. For this alone. it was worth going
abroad. Yet nothing struck me as much as
this pervasive feeling of being foreign.

This strange culture was sometimes
amusing. sometimes irustrating. but it
never bored me, I did not suffer from
culture shock: I searched it out. Nearly

It seems that the cleanest, nicest dorm
to have as one's territory is Clark; second
to Clark is probably Langan. excluding the

relation to these two halls the reply was:
“No Comment!"

Males. the housekeepers agree, keep
“messler” bathrooms than girls, while co-
ed bathrooms are the worst. Regardless of
the sex, all housekeepers noted an im-
