Corvus Computer System

by ’l‘or l-lough

One part of the new Younker Memorial
Computing Area. opened last semester. is
a new conus computer ystem. The
CORVUS system is called n computer
terms. a "local area network ” The net-
work links together all of the Rainbow
Microcomputers with a shared storage
unit and shared printers, There are i2
Rainbous connected to the network. Each
Rainbow can access software stored on a
Common disk drive. as well as two
printers. one with narrow paper for
documents and another with wide paper
tor printing programs and data.
~ Storedon the disk drive. accessible from
all Rainbows in the YMCA. is a wide varie-
ty of software The most Commonly used is
the MASSrll text processor system. The
CORVUS network will make it much
easier for MASS-ll users because they will
no longer need to use 5 separate diskettes.
All of the software necessary to use
MASS-11 is stored on the shared hard
driver The version on the network is iden»
tical to the version on the disk sets. so
users who are already familiar with

senators should get input. Annette asked
that the senators take this letter seriously
and find out from their constituents not on»
ly their views on this issue but also if they
feel Ted should be able to make a state-
ment like this in their names." While hall
meetings may have been recommended.
they were not required; there are other
ways of gathering student input than the
hall meeting as can be shown in an exam-
ple taken from Main Hall.

The Main Hall senator posted, on each
floor. copies of Mr. Amann's letter with a
statement asking for input; at a recently
held hall meeting. students were asked if
they felt their input had been adequately
solicited and if they had been properly
represented. The constituents responded
“yes” and voiced no complaints with the
way the issue had been handled.

As we can see. there is more than one
way to “skin a cat.” Ms. Deichman should
consider alternatives to the hall meeting
before denouncing senators who did not
hold hall meetings and implying that these
senators “did not know the opinion of their
dorms"—or that they “voted entirely on
their own behalves," Her implications
may be true in some instances. but before
she arrives at this absolute conclusion, Ms.
Deichman should consider the entire pier
lure.

Perhaps Ms. Delchman's representation
to the entire campus by claiming to pre»
sent an SGA brief is as self-gratifying in
purpose as she implies a senator’s is.
There was no mention in her last report ot
other items worthy of student attention.
such as the continued MGM boycott, im-
plementation of student surveys which will
affect plans for the proposed student
center. or new penalties for theft of KDIC
albums. Clearly her report is lacking. 7

MASSAII will not need to realearn anything
to use the network version The network
verSion also has some added abilities. The
most popular feature will probably be the
spelling checker which can be used irom
within MASSVII. Also new are list process-
ing capabilities irom within MASS 11. This
will allow users conveniently to set up
form letters. labels. and other material
which requires lists.

For the more adventurous users. the net-
work will make available a large library of
public domain software. One such pro-

gram is FPRINT. which allows the user to ‘

print documents in assorted lancy fonts
(e.g. Gothic. Roman. Old English). This is
useful for making catchy signs and invita-
tions. for example. There are also a wide

'variety of utility. textrprocessing, and

database management programs. If you
are interested. a user consultant can help
you begin exploring any of these options.

All of the Rainbows have been upgraded
so that they can now. using software on the
network. be used as graphics terminals to
the VAX. This will be highly useful to any
students wanting to use RS/l or other
graphics-intensive software packages.
Before the Corvus Network was installed.
there was just a handful of graphics ter-
minals and plotters available to students.

Each Rainbow still has access to the
VAX computers as a terminal. mough it is
hoped that the Rainbows will be used more
as independent computing devices.
Presently. any student who has had ex-
perience using the Rainbow microcom-
puters may apply ror an account on the
network. Forms are available in the Com-
puter Services office in Darby.

been as diiiicult. and they do not regret the 7

high demands that were placed on them.
It is difficult at this point in the semester
to think rationally about academic
pressure. However. “life in general” is not
pressure-free eiﬂ'ler. Learning to deal with
stress and pressure is liberally educating
us in the realm of our “emotional
health"—-learning how to cope with stress
now will be beneficial for us later on when
we feel pressure in the “real" world. Furs
ther, “life in general”does not tell us what
to do and requires us to make choices. In
being forced to set priorities here at Grin—
hell in the ”sphere of academia.” we are
learning, a valuable “social-interaction"
skill that will serve us well outside the
academic world of Grinnell. Mr Munley
seems to believe that because of the great
emphasis on academics we will lack the
ability to function efficiently and effective
ly within the bounds of our diverse. logical.
subtle. and social world upon graduating
from Grinnell. But if we are to function ef-
ficiently. we must learn to set priorities»-
about relationships. work. goals. etc. And
to continue functioning. we must learn to
deal with stress in our fastspaced world.
Therefore. contrary to what Mr. Munley
believes. the strong emphasis on
academics does develop the skills weneed
in order to operate in the world.

told me that it was twenty dollars towards
a study break.

Then they proceeded to tell me of their
plans for their floor _ “We're gonna build

Norris will linaliy have a iircplacet We're
going to put a Santa and his sleigh with a

school, lie was also being punished lor not
passing his Spelling Test. Rumors cir-
culated that he had gotten “ten on each

Strangely. I have never regretted my
years at Saint Oliver's. They taught us
well. We learned to study. the hard way.
perhaps. but we learned. After I left
lreland. and spent several weeks in a Ger
man school. my molded behavior was met
with Snickers and giggles. Even during my
first few weeks at an American high school
l found myself calling my teachers "Sir”
and “Ma’am” Someone eventually
pointed out that this was called “Brown
nosing" and that it was frowned upon by
other students. That concept was unheard
of in freland; teachers rarely had “pets"

Scarlet and Black. one can clearly see that
Rhoads’ accusations simply does not hold.
Of the five articles on homophobia;
Johnson and Baker were quoted in only
two, In the five articles. five students-both
gay and non-gay»were quoted. in addition
to various members of the faculty and ad
ministration. Thus it seems quite clear
that the s and B is not quoting “almost ex»
clusively" two individuals. Articles under
editorial scrutiny covering homophobia
(not including ”SGA Notes" and
“Letters") received coverage in only two
successive issues of the paper, which one
cannot reasonably liken to “editorial
manipulation.” But of all the unsuppor-
table accusations Rhoads made. by far the
worst was the implicit incrimination of
Johnson and Baker. 1 sincerely hope that
in the future Rhoads will employ better
iudgment before persecuting victims.

back to the Moors. Seafood. turkey or lamb
often is served at these meals. .

The Spanish observe Christ's birth at
midnight on Christmas Eve. Each day
lollowing the birthday. children move the
Wise men on the nativity scene closer to
the manger. On the sixth of January, the
wise men linaliy arrive.

Much as Santa Claus brings presents in
other countries. the wise men leave gifts
for children. The children in turn put out
lettuce for the camels and food for the
presentrbearers.

The Christmas traditions of Western
Europe all have their own special
character. Are you tired of American
Christmases? Try different decorations.
Different foods. Tell the Christmas stories
that people in other places tell. Or better
yet. travel somewhere to celebrate. Merry
Christmas!
