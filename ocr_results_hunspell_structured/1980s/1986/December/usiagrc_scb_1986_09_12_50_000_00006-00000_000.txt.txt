There in no doubt the millions spent

Perhaps some of the most glaring
neglect of the administration t. in

aculty retentioni As reported in this

aper last aetneuer, the college lost a
disturbing number of junior faculty to
other institutions and it is reported that
Grinnell pays ite faculty some of the
lowest salaries among colleges its size.
Although the administration does
recognize the need for an increase in

Multy salaries, are the increases going
to be comparable to the amount spent
on new Iago ar moneterouit parking

deal with the poor sound in ARH seems
to only manifest the college’s tacit
belief that student social activities take

back seat to both academic and
marketing interest: of the college.

It-ie important for the college ad-

Observations...
Mayday'in Germany

By Marty Myszeuski

The first of May is national holiday in
West Germany. On this day people all
across the nation g0 hiking in the mnunr
tains, wandering through the lorests,
bicycling, swimming, picnicing and other-
wise celebrating the beginning oi summer
weather. This past year was dillercnt in
that I numbered among them and that the
clouds above us on that warm day were
saturated with radioactive particles from
the melt-down at Chernobyl.

l was not unaware that the clouds were
there nor that they contained radioactive
particles, but i and apparently the greater
part of the population of Western Europe
were then unaware of the extent of the
danger of exposure. The govenment press
releases concerning Chernobyl earlier in
the week stated that there was no danger
to residents of West Germany. Later
reports stated that there was no acute
danger, The addition of that one word went
largely unnoticed.

Fear and concern about exposure to
radiation on that Thursday were mild; 'l
bicycled the [105 kilometers to Baden»
Baden and spent the afternoon relaxing in
the outdoor thermal and mineral baths. I
was far from alone in either activity.
Kristina Scott was in Bonn, relaxing out:
side and working on her tan, iully unaware
of me radioactive particles in the clouds
above her. Sigrid Nelson was in Amsterr
dam and heard nothing more’ than vague
rumors until Monday the 5th, when she
returned to Tubingen. Jenny Halcrow was
in Prague and was uninformed until she,
too, returned to Tubingen. Everyone I
have talked to knew, on the first of May,
little of the accident itself and even less
about the danger from the fallout

By the weekend, concern had blossomed
to mild panic across the nation, For the
next week we were exposed to a rapidly
growing number of reports and specular
lions about the radiation and its conse
quences, Notably lacking in the myriad
reporls‘and statements from the politi-
cians, experts, government agencies and
other sources was coherency In the “Bild
Zeitung” I read that 2000 were already
dead in lhe Soviet Union and the death toll
would grown exponentially. On the other
end of the spectrum I heard that there was
no need [or concern because the radiation
levels were no higher than H] the 60's when
the United States and France were conduc-
ting their extensive nuclear lesLs in the
Pacific. Neither was comforting nor inforr
mative,

The state governments soon set the
allowable radiation levels for dairy pro
ducts, vegetables, fruit, meat and poultry.
There was no conformity in the levels set
state by state, so again there was no stan
dard to determine the real danger. In
Baden-Wurtemburg. where I was, the

allowable radiation for one liter of milk
was 550 becquerel. In West Berlin it was
25.

This presented another problem, The
unit of measurement for radiation was the
bccquerel. For surfaces it was measured
in becquerel per square meter, for ﬂuids it
was per liter and lor solids, per kilogram. l
was unable to extract anything meaningful
from the great abundance of numbers and
measures. Five weeks passed beiorc 1
learned anything about what a bccquerel
meant in terms of health hazards, and then
it was expressed in cancer deaths per
million persons per liter of milk con-
taminated at X becquerel. For Kristina
Scott, a like period of time passed before
she‘was given an explanation comparing
the exposure to the radiation over one
month to receiving some quantity ol
X»rays.

A woman I knew in the student
residences worked in a lab with radioaCr
tive isotopes and one night she brought a
Geiger counter home with her. That night
In the second week or May, I saw in
numbers reasons to be scared. In the
darkest corners or her apartment, the
meter was reading iewcr than so bec-
querel. On my Shoes, the meter read bet
ween 1200 and 1500. -

Rather than trust the conservative and
vague government reports of what was
safe and not safe. and possibly risk Cancer
in twenty or thirty years, I made major
changes in my lilestyle. AS with Sigrid and
Jenny in Tubingen and Kristina ll'l Bonn,
most of the suggestions I heard and follow»
ed came from fellow students and pro-
lessors. For the first week I took showers
twice a day. Up until the time I left
Freiburg in mid July, I took my shoes oil
at the door so as not to track radioactive
particles into my apartment. I drank no
milk, ate no yogurt, no cheese. no ice
cream not other dairy products lot six
weeks, until the government reported that
it was again “safe lor young children, nur-
smg and expectant mothers to drink milk”
(the government never extended this
recommendation to other members of the
population). Until I returned to the United
States, I ate no fresh vegetables of fruit,

unless they came from Spain, Portugal or

Morocco. For SlX weeks I dld not go swim
ming at any of the lakes around Freiburg,
did not go hiking in the Black Forest and
dld not lie out. to sun bathe. Rain was all
but liquid cancer.

I was not the only one to make life style
adjustments because oi the radiation.
Signs of the fear were ever present and in a
wide range of expression. In the stores, un»
sold milk and other dairy were piled high
into the aisles. Powdered milk was being
rationed, The market on the Cathedral
square where the local farmers have been
selling their produce for hundreds of

her level of selectivity has had something

SELECTIVITY REVISITED

Ihave noticed that a dry spell on campus

THE PUB AREA

almost every weekend up until the time I
left. Burgerinitiativen (Citizens in

tive laws and actions regarding present
and future radiation problems. There were
small riots, only one oi which I saw, but
others I heard oi from friends. Banners

II I had to choose one word to Sum up the
feelings for myself and the others I have
talked with, it would be helpless. The
radiation was everywhere and in
everything. We walked on it, breathed it,
ate it, drank it and thought it. The radia-
tion was an inescapable iact of life, even
though the accident occurred over 1200
kilometers to the East.

The distress of living in tear and suspir
cion of the whole environment made me
more than once consider leavmg Europe
for the relative Safety of the United States.
I feel fortunate to have had that choice.
even though I did not opt tor it until mid
summer. For my lirends and acquainr

been as easy it at all possible. My worry
now is that next time or the time after.
