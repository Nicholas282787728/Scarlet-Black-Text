'During Farm Crisis '

by Karin Sedestrom

Those oi you irom small towns and rural
areas know what it is very well. Some oi
you. and some oi your parents, may be in»
volved in it. But some oi us have been
liielong suburbanites or city kids we
don't have that iirsthand awareness at the
problem that is the iarm crisis. and it may
be diiiicult to understand the speciiics. i
personally lived the iirst eleven years oi
my liie in a suburb oi Detroit, and since
then have resided in another one. Luckily
ior me. my mother was born and raised in
Pana. a small iarming town in central ll-
linois. and I have spent a good chunk or
every summer oi my liie there, I wanted
to cover Grace Knipper's speech for the
public iorum “Surviving the Farm Crisis”

Remoteness of
Undergrad Facilities

A iinal iactor not alleviated by
iellowships or sabatticals is Grinnell’s
distance lrom major cities, curtailing con-
tact with research facilities and other
scientists

Wubbels stated his “long history oi pro-
blems in a setting oi this kind.,tt's isolated
and there are no graduate students to help
in research " His position as president oi
the chemistry division oi the Council on
Undergraduate Research. an organization
which promotes research work at colleges
through conierences and publications.
has aided him in solving some oi these dif~
iiculties ,

The remoteness oi Grinnell's location
and the limits ot undergraduate iacilities
can be overcome. according to Connolly.
Conneily has p blished several scholarly
articles since joining Grinnell in mo but
said that his specialization in a particular
branch oi English literature had
necessitated his using libraries m Great
Britain “But i think that most books and
materials are available through inter-

to [ind out what it was all about, for almost
purely personal reasons, and then maybe I
could tell others a little bit about what is
going on.

“Surviving the Farm Crisis" was a two
day public iorum sponsored by the
Agriculture Committee of Grinnell 2000
Foundation, and Grinnell College's Rosenr
field Program in Public Affairs, Internar
tinnal Relations and Human Rights. It
teatured lectures and discussions by
various people on what the iarm crisis is
and what can be done about it both on the
local and national level There was a good
article about some of the rest of this forum
in the last S and B, by Kristen Stromberg.

This article is about the speech made by
Mrs. Grace Knipper. “Iowa iarm wile,

library loans." observed Connelly

Fortunately. Walker is able to do most oi
his research on campus. with materials
available here ordered in. or iniormation
attained irom the proiessional meetings
and eoniercnces he attends. In the past, he
has been able to prepare material tor
publication by taking a lower class load,
This is possible ior Walker due to the iact
that his publishers oiiered him money up
front; he could personally aiiord to work
iewer hours ior lesspay However, he ad-
mits that many iaculty members con»
tracts may not be structured in the same
way to make the same allowance.

Andelson has been concentrating on the
Amana Colonies as his research iocus.
since his sources ol iniormation are near»
by. his location ior research in Grinnell is
prime.

He admits. though, that with a five-
course load and the “expectations tor com-
mittee service." he has virtually no time to
work on research during the school year,
He is due ior sabbatical this year. but has
not yet decided precisely when he will be
taking it He is in his thirteenth year oi
teaching at Grinnell.

As Mr. Andelson pointed out. "the pro-
blem oi iaculty retention and sabbatical
policy was not a common topic oi discus
sion as it is now. However. everybody is
trying to iind an equitable solution "

mother and educator," entitled “Let’s Sur-
vive this Together."

The first thing Mrs. Kntpper, a nice
looking brunette, did was to take off that
jacket she were with a matching skirt and
blouse, As she did so, she informed the au-
dience that “I am a member of the Nae
tional Speakers Association And the first
thing they tell you in the National
Speakers Association is to never. ever.
ever. under any circumstances. remove
your jacket. because it takes away your
authority.”

The audience gave a knowing chuckle of
approval

She had made her first polnt, that “I am
a iarm wiie going through the iarm crisis.
just as everyone else is." Everyone was
on the same level now, She even told of
how she had lost her wedding ring several
years ago. and how her husband had pror
mised her a new one ior their anniversary.

when the anniversary came. the Kmp-
pers' iarm was barely breaking even. But
Mr Knipper kept his promise; true to his
word, he took his wife into town and bought
her a new wedding ring for $2 79 at Ben
Franklin.

“There once were two farmers who were
constantly working on their iarms, irom
dawn til dusk and with very little lree
time. Both their wives said to them ‘ Look,
you two need a vacation. Why don’t you go
camping for a Weekend and us and the kids
will do the work in a tew clays?" So Carl
and Axel Went to the mountains, pitched
their tent and that night. as they were tryr
ing to go to sleep. they heard the telltale
scratching on the outside of the tent Carl
leaned over to Axel and whispered. ‘Axel. I
thin ,’that’s a bear; but if we lie here
quietly. maybe it will go away.‘ ..

Axel Jumped up. leaped out oi his sleep ~

ing bag and began pulling on his pants and
booLs. Carl whispered irantically ‘Axel,
you're crazy! You can't outrun that
bear" “

“ ‘But,’ replied Axel, ‘1 don’t HAVE to
outrun the bear, all I have to do is outrun
YDUK'. "

With that particular anecdote, Mrs,
Knipper had a neat lead-in for another one
of her main points, “There are 220 million
people in America and 2.5 million farmers.
The iarmers have to stop trying to outrun
the urban consumers, and they have to
stop trying to outrun each other. It's time
to stop. The Reverend Jesse Jackson has
said. “We should turn to, and not on, each
other.‘ ” .

Urban consumers make it possible for
iarmers to have an easier time of it, Ad»
vances in iarming machinery have been
made possible by urban consumers. And
of Course, the urban consumers also coh-
sume what the iarmer grows.”

She then showed the audience a rope,
and used this to analogize the situation
thus 7 “There are two tactions, farmers
and urban consumers, one on each end of
the rope, But we are all tied to the land ”

Mrs. Knipper stressed the point oi being
concerned about what happens to one’s
neighbors, working together, and “don't
give up,”

She then gave herself and the audience a
Short break “Now. 1 want you all to talk to
each other and come up with the reasons
for the farm crisis.”

This is when things got interesting. i
was sitting with Daryl Petty. a loan officer
at the Brenton Bank. Clarence Sears and
Veronon Turlow. both farmers, and Dick
Arnedt, the president of the Bank of
Montezuma. Together, they came up with
the following reasons for the crisism

“Bankers."

“Overproduction.”

“Low commodity prices ”

“Okay, l’m going to be controversial
