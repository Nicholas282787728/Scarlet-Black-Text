‘Our guys just weren't ready to

showed us that we deﬁnitely have
to come ready to play" While
outscoring Knox in the second hali,
it was too little, too late, with the
bad guys chalking up a 7o52 vic-
tory.

Westlund indicated that Knox
was playing well, and said that
"it’s irustrating to play irom
behind," Indeed it is, Catch-up ball
is never easy, a painiul incentive
to come prepared to play quality
ball.

while the Pioneers may have
learned this lesson of the impor-
tance oi preparation, they still
came up empty against lllinois
College on Saturday. losing 39457.
They stayed within lour and six
points throughout the contest, only
to {alter at the end. For Coach
Westlund, sudden “freeze-ups in
crunch time” are the Achilles heel
of the Pioneers.

That magical day was pushed a
little iarther into the future, as
Cornell proved too hard to handle
Tuesday night in Darby, topping
the Pioneers 96-36. The iinal,
however, in no way indicates the
level oi play and the intensity
which Grinnell displayed. The
Pioneers played good, solid basket-
ball, only to iall victim to that
nemesis oi "crunch time" again.

Since the team hadn't been

shooting very well in the past cou-
ple oi weeks. Westlund was anx-
ious and optimistic about coming
back home. He knew that his guys
shot better on their own court. He
tigured (hoped) that better
shooting and the coniidence oi
playing at home would boost them
over that imaginary “top." Well,
they did shoot well and did have
the crowd behind them. Unlorr
tunately, this just didn't prove to
be enough.

As the game progressed, the

prone position, his eyes shut and
mouth open. However. the
iascinatingly iictiooal testimony oi
the head officer (who can best be
described as an animated heap of
gelatinous goo} kept me in-
terested. One oi his many untruths
was that I had invited the officers
into the house by saying, “Yes, you
may come in." Very polite oi me,
He testified that during the search
ol the house, the officers had mere-
1y “glanced around," not opening
any drawers or closets i also have
very strong reason to suspect that
he lied while testifying about the
crucial point oi having probable
cause to enter the house. I will
iinally get my say at the next hear-
ing, appropriately set (or April
Fool's Day.

Although a crime oi sorts was
committed, i believe its extremely
mild nature in no way justiiied the
very possibly illegal entry ol the
house, the illegal search oi the
house, the heavyrhanded arrest
procedure, or the {also testimony.
In fact, I believe the questionable

actions oi the oiiicers represent a
iar more serious threat to society
than several college-aged iriends
drinking a iew beers and watching
TV.

Before I continue, i would like to
acknowledge that the great ma»
jority oi oiiicers are honest people
who do vital work tor our country.
However, the power and authority
that oiiicers have allow the iew
who have watched too many
episodes oi “Miami Vice" to cause

rightly admired ior having one oi

duct 7 such as illegal searches and
arrests, harrassment and physical

because it undermines one oi the

alienable rights as ireedom oi

what distinguish the u.s. irom

Further, I believe a contributing
iactor to police aggressiveness and
rule-bending exists in the judicial
system. It is usually much cheaper
and less time-consuming to plead
guilty to a mild oiiense and get it
over with. Even if one believes that
one's rights have been violated. the
