Women mobilize, or

Grinnell chapter of NOW: .

town-gown liason

by Mary Scho/ze

Grinnell College has a long history
of interest in the emancipation and
equality of women. As early as 1915
Grinnell demonstrated this interest by
inviting Ms, Emmeline Pankhurst (the
founder of the Suffrage Movement in
England) to speak before the college
Ms. Pankhurst stimulated a great deal
of interest in Grinnell, and the suf-
frage heritage was passed from
mothers to daughters. One of the
daughters was 'Ms. Maggie Kiesel.

ly said nothing, let the women have
the South Lounge for an evening, and
the Grinnell Chapter of NOW was
born.

The emphasis of the Grinnell
Chapter is on two points: 1) Listen-
ing/Referal and 2) Education/An-
ticipation. The group also is a liaison
between town and college women,
allowing free exchange of ideas. As to
the first point, the Grinnell chapter of
NOW has helped a female student gain
the right to practice track with the

 

“DOn’t end up hanging diapers on

the line for the rest of your life.”

 

A current member of the Grinnell
Chapter of NOW (National Organiza-

tion for Women), Ms. Kiesel considers '

herself a hereditary feminist on her
mother’s side. “The Second World
War is really where, for me, the
Movement began," she says. The days
when women Worked in factories while
the men were away fighting, when
women had careers and raised
families, too, and when educational
opportunities really opened up for
women. It was after the war, in the
19505, that Ms. Kiesel taught school
and urged her advice on her female
students, “Beware,” she said, ”don’t
‘end up hanging diapers on the line for
the rest of your life." Ms. Klesel con-
tinued believing in her feminist
philosophy and in 1975 she helped .
organize a chapter of an organization
which shared her beliefs.

In December of 1976, Ms. Louise
Rosenfield Noun (class of '29) came to
Grinneil to organize a chapter of
NOW. The administration was ner-
vous. but the fact that Ms Louise
Roscnfleld Noun was a regular cons
tributor to the college coffers eased
theiLmjnds. The administration wise»

men’s team this year.

As to the second point, the NOW
organization has provided information
to the campus on several important
issues. NOW was the first organization
in Grinnell to realize the seriousness
of sexual harassment and assault and
to inform the people of Grinnell about
it. In the 1577-73 school year they spon-
sored a speaker from the Des Moines
Rape Crisis Center and they sponsored
Ms. Betsy Gilman’s dlscussion on Bab
tcred Women. The next school year,
1978-79. the NOW group organized and
sponsored a ”Panel Discussion on
Rape and Harassment" featuring
Police Chief Peters, the Nursing
Supeersor from the Grinnell Hospital,
and Dr, Paulson. This year NOW is
working with the college through Task
Forces to help stop the current trend
of harassment and assault on campus,

The Grinnell Chapter of NOW is a
vital operating organization in the
community providing an example of
proud, dedicated women who are cone
ccrned with the implementation of
freedom and equality in the largest
sense it! those two words,

It was very disconcerting to the
Grinnell College Women’s Group to
discover at a recent convocation
speech that some students are not
aware of this group‘s activities and
purpose, We are a group of young
women and men, striving to raise the
consciousness of the college communi-
ty. This means we try to make
everyone. women and men, aware of
sexism around them and m i
themselves. We are not the Amazons
of the past, the men-haters. This is not
our philosophy. We are a student
group interested in providing the cam-
pus with a feminist perspective. since
this is usually not included in the
overall picture.

Women's Week is an effective way
for us to communicate this viewpoint.
Last semester it included: speaker
Toni McNaron clarifying women’s role
in the English Canon, 3 women’s wor-
ship Seerce, an abortion speaker,
films, and a feminist singer. This
semester most of our energy has gone
into supporting the Women in Public
Affairs Seminar. This is aimed at bring-

Our group is a contact point at
which lesbian/feminists can meet
each other and give and gain support
from each other,

As most groups do on this campus,
the size of our group tends to vary in
accordance with the amount of study
ing the members have to do. Not all
members of the group are lesbiansso
there have been dlscussions arounvl
the issues which affect our being at
peace with our sexuality (whether
straight or gay) both within ourselves
and within society.

We also have members of the group
from town,which helps us to think in
terms of lite outside of the campus,
These womyiiw‘have also been added
support in ways that the campus can
not be.

Along With being a support group,
the lesbian/feminist group receives
