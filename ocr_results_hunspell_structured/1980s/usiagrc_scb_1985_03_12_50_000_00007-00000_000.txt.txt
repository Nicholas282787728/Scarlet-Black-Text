basketball this side ol the Miss ippl
,River LSD prevailed over Muu 58 to
47. MUG jumped out an early 5 point
llead on the strength of two Scott Brenr
nan three-pointers. LSD quickly caught
'up and the teams traded baskets for
about ten minutes into the half.
However. MUG took a trip to Alaska
and got very. very cold, This allowed
LSD to open up an eight point lead over
the MUG boys at hall,

The second hall proceeded pretty
much as the first half with MUG and
LSD trading baskets. This was not
enuugh for MUG to close the deficitand
so they started fouling LSD. Known for

their impeccable foul-shooting. LSD
was able to hang onto their lead and
become the Special Interest champion.

hand to congratulate the winners. but
was at 1055 when asked to present a
trophy. He was heard to say that their
