,Student Supports
Right of Expression

To the Editor:

I was taught when I was younger
that one or the reasons democracy
was so good was that it tried to pro-
tect the ireedem of the minority
trom oppression by the majority,
and also tried to protect the
ireedom oi the majority irom op-
pression by the minority. While
this has not worked perfectly in the
United States. people have been
constantly trying to adapt the
system so that it might Work bet-
ter. Given this view oi democracy,
I find it quite ironic that one of the
most ”liberal” college Com-
munities could be so
undemocratic. Isn't part of the
liberal Grinnell psyche the idea
that it is OK to be different? But
God iorbid if you do not express the
“right” different beliefs.

in Grinnell, the campus oi
goodness and light, people who do
not have the “right” beliefs are
iorced to express themselves as
anonymously as possible, for ex»
ample, by ripping down signs they
find offensive, I am not condoning
this action, but I ask you to cone
sider tor a moment: last year, so-
meone put up signs on campus
anonymously expressing views oi
homophobia, These signs were not
only ripped down, but a massive
search was conducted to find the
person who put them up and to take
them to Junco. Now, justbecause
these signs displayed the wrong at
titude, yes, a very ignorant one at
that, and they did it violently, they
were just signs 7 words. We must
respect each person's right to ex-
press his or her opinions whether
we agree with them or not. in order
to ensure our own right to believe

what we wish and to vocalize those
beliets. Those signs were threaten»
ing to a group of people, but they
did not threaten speciiie people.
were not slanderous nor libelous,
and thus had as much right as any
other sign to be posted.

Another incident, where DJS of
KDIC offended a part of their
listening audience, resulted in the
DJS being suspended and the star
lion being taken off the air {or a
week. The people who listen to
KDIC know that it is an effort of a
lot of different students, and that
each radio show expresses the
views oi only the people whose
Show it is unless otherwise stated.
While many of the DJS' comments
oiiended me, I must respect the
DJs’ righu to express opinions and
understand that not every com-
ment was probably thought out and
intentional. if someone thinks that
l. as one of the women on campus.
am fucking weak, they have the
right to believe this, and the right
to tell me. 1 also have the right to
tell these people that are fucking
weak to think that I have to unders-
tand intuitively What it is to grow
up as a black man in an urban enr
vironmenl. That is just the Way the
First Amendment Works.

By not allowing everyone to exr
press his or her opinions openly,
many people are iorcing
underground homophobia, racism,
anti-feminism, and many other
beliefs termed Wrong These
beliefs do not disappear, they
[ester and grow. and are expressed
in very unconstructive ways, Watr
ching this campus is like watching

To the Editor:

I would like to clarify a few
items regarding your front
page article on disc jockeys
David Steinman and Bill Cola
lins. The KDIC rules and
regulations which were in
force at the time Bill and David
were suspended do not state
that a first warning must be
given prior to a permanent
suspension. The rules state,
and l quote, ”If a written Com~
plaint is tiled against a DJ or
DJs regarding the use oi
obscenitics, an automatic two-
wdeek suspension will be invok-
e

With regard to Bill and
David, KDIC received written
complaints in the name oi iour
current students and one
visiting alumnus, aiter the
complaints were received,
Stephanie Redman and I spoke
with David Steinman and Bill
Collins. both of whom admitted

Rap Music
be Heard”

To the Editor:

I iear that this letter is doomed
not to be read by the campus
because we've all be inundated
with the “KDIC incident."
However, this incident has ob»
vlously raised serious issues about
iree speech and attempts to raise
social consciousness regarding
sexism and racism. While I con-
sider myscli to be a staunch
feminist, and I am seeking effec-
tive ways to eradicate racism, i
am proioundly against the actions
taken by SF and R tor both
strategic and political reasons.

First strategic. To ban Collins'
and Steinman's show is to eiiec-
tively ban an entire category or
music that must belicnril and dealt
with ii we seek to undermine [he
sexism that generates such music.
No. I don't like the particular
words in the songs recently played,
but I do not believe that by closing
our ears we are changing
anything. Instead, we are choosing
to be dear to the symptoms oi sex-
ism that enable us to hear how sex-
ism tunctions. We cannot tight an
enemy we do not hear, and the
enemy does not go away when the
volume is turned down Pretending
we can and that it does is both ilr
lusory and dangerous,

Moreover, while I am offended
by Steinman and Collins'
characterization oi urban “ghet-
tos" (the result oi oppression
which is nnt merelv individual. but

to using proianity over the air.
At this point the automatic two
week suspension was invoked.
i also considered sispending
both DJS permanently at this
point because or previous Vera
hal complaints about their use
or profanity over the air, not
because oi the musical content
oi their show. ldecided tirst to
coniirm what Steven Jones had
told Bill Collins regarding an
incident on their show oi
March 5, 1988. My interpreta
tion oi their conversation was
that Bill understood that his
use oi proianity was a violation
oi KDIC and FCC regulations,
and that he would refrain irom
using proianity over the air in
the iuture, l considered the in-
cident oi April 9, was, to have
been a repeat oiiense, and
repeated violations are
grounds ior dismissal as a DJ
I decided that permanent

banning rap music, we are banning
and judging an entire medium tor
expression oi resistance that must

the intention was not to ban all rap
music, but that is the result

Finally. political. I resist censors

soiship that is so emotionally charg~
ed and a result of liberal think-
mg. l was sincerely frightened and
appalled by the bureaucratic effir
ciency and unanimity that was
displayed by SF and R. I iear such
“community” action and resist
silencing in the name oi “liberal
values.“ Do not get me ivrong — l
abhor the sexist and ractst (and
classisti comments made by Stein
man and Collins, My argument,
however, is not calling out ior our
First Amendment right of free
speech — instead, it is calling out
to res t such coercrve, “consen-
sus”-inspired moves

Let me reiterate: I am not defen-
ding Collins and Steinman as in
dividuals, i am delending rap
music and arguing that it must be
heard I am also resisting
bureaucratic unanimity, lt scares
me. 7 Rebecca Weston

suspension was in order
because oi the number oi writ
ten and verbal complains
received about hoth the March
5 and April 9 incidents, because
oi possible FCC action on our
license, and aiter listening to a
tape oi their March a show.
Now, to those who believe
that the DJs had no warning,
and thereiore should have not
been suspended permanently, 1
would like to say the iollowing:
ii Each semester KDIC
holds an organizational
meeting and atsome point durr
ing each meeting the 1(ch
rules and regulations are
reviewed, particularly those
regarding the use or proianity
2) This semester each DJ
signed the iirst page oi his or
her application stating that he
or she had “read and iully
understood the KDIC rules and
regulations" and agreed “to
abide by those rules while
operating the station." These
rules and regulations have
been on reserve in Burling
Library since February 1, was,
3) Bill and Dave received
numerous calls irom their
listeners, throughout the
semester, requesting that they
retrain irom using proianity
over the air
I believe that even ii a warn
ing had not been given during
Bill's conversation with Steven
Jones, Bill and David should
have been mature enough to
abide by the rules which they
had agreed to iollow. Common
sense and the combination oi
the above three items should
have prevented this entire lnCis
dent iroin evei- occurring. ll

, saddens me that We have had

to lose two shows which were of
very high quality musically
(the reason why those shows
were chosen in the first placel.
It really anger me, however,
that our license \ ds jeopardiz-
ed and that the hard work oi
the KDIC staff and DJS has
been marred by the unprofes-
sional attitude oi a iew.

I would like to reassure each
member of the Grinnell Com-
mumty that the SP and R com-
mittee and the KDlC staii are
working hard to correct
numerous problems which Cu -
rently exist at KDIC. This
cludes purchasing new equip
ment, computerizing our
record library, updating those
rules, and working with the
Student Building Committee on
the possibility oi a new studio.

I would like to thank those oi
you who lived through our
week oi silence, and 1 en-
courage all or you to continue
to listen, and give the DJs and
staff your input and support
Thank you 7 Wayne Seaman.
KDIC station Manager
