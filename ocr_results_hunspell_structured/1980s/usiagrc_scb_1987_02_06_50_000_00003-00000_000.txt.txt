like turning back into the swamp. There's

no value in that, so there's no desire or
reason to want to turn back."

Q: How did your children feel about your
decision?

A: “You mean, like when they were unrec-
or Ioureyearscld? They really didn’t
understand much of that. Now I think they
have a reasonably good understanding,
within their limitations, of why I do what I
do and why i don’t live in the way that
other people, including them, live, But
their understanding is limited by their ex-
periences."

The cow is described as a “not!-
hierarchical religious community"; in
what ways is it religious?

A: “The essence oi every religion is that
you have to, number one, love God and,
number two, love your neighbors, lt ilows
out or the acceptance oi the existence of a
god. So that‘s what it means to be a
religious person and that’s what it means
to be a religious community.”

Q: in an interview once you said that the
CCNV isn-t ior everybody and that you
iigure out quickly whether or not you
belong. What kind or person do you think it
takes to make him devote this kind or time
to the cause?

A: “Suggesting that the CCNV might not
be the best place ior everyone, which it
isn't. has nothing to do with what people
should be doing. It is a specific place, with
specific tasks and specific relationships.
But that has nothing to do with the (act that
we are called to be doing the same kinds of
things, in general terms. There’s no way of
saying what kind oi person would iit best
into the CCNV. There's all kinds of Elite
ierent people there, but it generally helps
it you're pretty serious about what you’re
about, and if you're prepared to struggle
hard and work hard and carry a fair
amount oi weight."

Q: You also said that you “live by inith."
It‘s 1' ' h in God. ior one thing. but is there
anyt ng based in society that you have
iaith in?

A: “I have faith in the basic decency of
human beings."

Q: An article [ read quoted a iormer iricnd
oiyours as comparing you to John the Bap»
tist. in that he was disliked by many people
but we need people like that in society. to
get things done. no you think that part oi
your ability to get things done is not get.
ting along with some people, stepping on
some tocs’.’

News

A: “We’re not called to get along with
everyone, we’re called to be iaithiul to the
truth. And in a world that isn't built on
truth, that doesn’t always make as
popular. And i don’t want to be compared
to John the Baptist because 1 don’t like
what happened to him."

oi 0ve id over again you're rcierred to
as radi i, be you think that's an accurat
assessment? .

A: “It's not accurate at all. It’s only
relative to where most other people are at.
There's nothing radical about either
myself or the community oi which I'm a
part. We're a very imperfect effort to live
by religious and rational and human
values. And it’s uniortunately only in com-
parison to many others diat we could be
seen or described as radical."

o: What is your opinion to the recent
popular appeals to the public. such as
Hands Across America. Do you think they
accomplish much?

A: “They accomplish what they ace
complish. i would never discourage people
from trying to be of help."

Q: What ' your opinion oi the United
States‘ policy towards South Africa?

A: “I think it’s deeply consistant with our
other policies, We're a racist nation and i
guess we ieel a deep aitlnity with a group
oi racist people in South Africa. Any sup-
port that we oiier to the South Airican
government is something that we'll have
to answer to God for.”

Q: What about Nicaragua?

A: “We should keep our iucklng noses out
oi other people’s business, just like we like
people to‘ keep their noses out of our
business. it Canada started sending troops
into the northwest region of the United
States because they didn't like what we
were doing, 1 don’t think we'd much ap-
preciate . li we knew that other nations
were sending arms and were supplying ex-
plosives to people in our society that were
using them to shoot and mame and destroy
other people in our society, 1 don’t think
we'd ieel real good about that."

Q: You say that you right against policie-
and programs that are violent i~
detrimental to society. What speciiic
policies oi the us, government are you
against?

A: ”Just about all oi them. They all come
irom the same place. There's a pattern.”

COLLEGE
STUDENT INCOME. ,

A good partitime job that doesn't interfere with class
schedules, student activities and study time is pretty tough
to find in most college towns. That's why the nearby Army
Reserve makes so much sense to students.

After completing Basic Training and Advanced Indi—
vidual Training, you serve one weekend a month (usually
two 8—hour days, 50 Saturday and Sunday evenings are
yours). And you earn over $75 a weekend to start. You go to

at full Army pay,

Q: Many people like to believe that things
are getting better. Do you think it is true.
applied to the plight oi the homeless and
the poverty/stricken?

A: “it depends on who you ask. it you ask
the Duponts, they‘ll probably tell you
things are just great, And it you ask the
cockroaches, they’ll probably be ecstatic
because in the event at nuclear war it's
likely that they‘ll inherit the earth. So, it
you ask the majority ofhumankind, both in
this country and in other countries,
whether the quality oi liie is good or bad or
getting better, i don't think that you’d be
real pleased with the answer you got."

Q: What do you ieel college students
should do to iiclp remedy the problem?

A: “In reality, what they should do is leave
the school and begin their education.
Because the education that they’re really
getting in the colleges is more an ace
culturation than a preparation to live de-
cent and just lives. what everybody needs
to do, be they college students, profes-
sional people or kids, is to begin to reach

out to folks who are being victimized and
are being hurt. and to share what we have
and what we are with mose people,
wherever we are. And if we do that
seriously enough. and if we do that With
enough conviction then ultimately
everything will be just fine, and we'll wind

lege students. “ I mean, we’re here 4
years-they live here,.and we do get to go
home” to get specialized women's health
care. Davidson continued by saying, “i
don't ieel the GPs tgeneral practitioners)
in town are incapable, but the experience
of the women’s clinic-J feel that they're
more knowledgeable.”

Executive director of the Central Iowa
Family Planning clinic, Dinny Nielsen.
said that she‘s “ready to go" on the Grin-
nell satellite clinic, The recurring difficul»
ty is the cost of securing lacrllties in Grin-
nell. Nielsen said, “Because of Iunding
cuts. we were looking for free space, but
with the way the budget is looking, we may
be able to pay a minimal cost." The goal oi
the clinic is to provide adequate Service to
Grinnell College students, city of Grinnell
and Poweshlek County residents in a loca-
tion which maintains client’s privacy,

Nielsen said that she can't predict when
She will be in Grinnell, but She hopes it will
be within the next year. ”If and when we
do go down, we'll probably be open one day
every two weeks to do exams, have women
pick up birth control...and we'll have to
work out hours that are suitable to
students and working people," said
Nielsen.

Concerning the costs of health care, the
Marshalltown clinic charges women on a
sliding-lee scale based on their income.

“Students are put on our 1

Parenthood facility in Newton charges its
patients on a similar basis, as' do the Plan-
ned Parenthood clinics in Des Moines.
With the exception oi emergencies, all
these clinics have a waiting list oi one
week.

In Grinnelli at least one clinic, the
Wiltiang-Paulson clinic, otters regular
gynecological care. family planning, and

Rindels, cliice manager of the Clinic,

The average waiting period for an exam is
one week, with the exception oi emergen»

The new Des Moines weekend shuttle, a
suggested alternative [or women on cam
pus who do not want to use the women’s
health—Care laCllities in Grinnell, requires
women to make Saturday appointments

tunately, according to Barbara Hartman-
Giese, director of education for the Plannr
ed Parenthood of Des Moines clinics,
Saturdays are the most popular days ior
