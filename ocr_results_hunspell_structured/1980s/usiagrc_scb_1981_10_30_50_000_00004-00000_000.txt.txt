cine college's art collection
“'3 we tailing lll'tilter Care 0' “7

As the trustees of the college settle in for their tri~annual meeting, we
at the S&B are faced with a special challenge. This is our best opportunis
ty to present to them matters that we think deserve their attention. We
feel that the college’s Permanent Art Collection is one of those matters.

At present, the college’s art collection is made up of about 1,071 pain-
tings, drawings, prints, pieces of sculpture, photographs and other
original works of art. As for what all this means in dollars and cents,
Professor Richard Cervene, curator of the Permanent Art Collection,
didn‘t want to release a figure but termed it “substantial,”

The problem with the collection develops when you begin to discuss
how the art is stored and displayed. Right now, the college is failing bads
ly on both counts.

The art work that is not currently on display is being stored in a non»
climate controlled room in the basement of the Fine Arts building. What
that means is that all these original works of art are literally suffocating
in this overcrowded, locked room. Because there is no regulation of the

 

temperature or circulation of the air in the room, many of the wood '

pieces are cracking (the drastic change in temperature allows the wood
to expand and contract) and mold is growing on some of the paper ob»
jects.

Almost half of the art work is up in buildings on campus and, accor-
ding to Cervene, that not only has a positive aesthetic effect but also
allows those pieces of art to be exposed to some temperature regulation.

That’s really where the root of the problem lies. We have no place
where we can both properly store the art, and where it can be displayed
so that some educational value can be derived from it,

In the current plans for the renovation of Burling Library there is a
provision for a climate controlled environment in the basement. It
would be both a study and research center where the entire campus
community could have access to some of the works. But the key word is

- some. This is only a partial solution and doesn’t alleviate the overall pro-
blem.

Cervene pointed out that the college is very lucky to have such an ex
tensive collection. He said that it not only provides much aesthetic
pleasure but is also an incredible educational resource and teaching
asset. Well, if that’s true, you sure wouldn’t know it from the way things
are now,

What we need is a specifically designed building with proper climate
controls and security where the art collection can be both stored and
displayed, and we need it before it’s too late.

In pursuit of apathy?

To the Editor:

[ spent three hours Saturday at a
relatively unpubllslzed and poorly attend-
ed letter writing session in North Lounge, 1
was diligently protesting Reagan's proposs
ed Cut in the tax Incentives for conserva-
tion and solar power Without a doubt the
most exciting events of the afternoon were
the dozen or so people who peaked in to see
why the pingpong tables were not set up,
the two piano playing sessions by students
indifferent to our endeavors and, of
course, the cighl or so homeruns which
[lashed across the television in the lounge
next door. '

With all this energy and excitement
radiating throughout the forum that after-
noon, should 1 be upset that the number at
letters written to congress was pathetic?
0t course not. I have no right to decide
wllat stand people should take on these
issues. Further l would be naive‘if I sug
gesled that writing letters is a constructive
response in itsell

I write this to explicate the simple, yet
more rational reasons lor not attending a
letter writing campaign Unforlunately,

The Gang

Durlng Tuesday and Wednesday oi the
week before Fall Break a‘pelltion was clr-
culated which read as follows:

We, the undersigned, petition to
change the name at the James Hall
party from the JAMES GANG
BANG to the JAMES GAMES. til
you would like to see it changed to
another name, indicate so by your
signaturc.t

We feel that this change will in no
way take away from anyone's enjoy-
ment of the party, Furthermore, it
will enhance the enyoymcnt oi those.
who are disturbed by the negative
connotations ispecifically gang
bang:gang rapct of the present
name.

Fivehundred and thirty students signed
this petition lor a name change, yet Mons
day night the residents of James Hall
voted to retain the name "James Gang
Bang "The retention of this name is both
lriistrating and disturbing. It is irustrating
because it leaves one wondering how to br-
ing about a change for which significant
support has been demonstrated and it is
disturbing because it reveals an insenr
sitivity to the problem of violence against
women

Although part of each student's activity
fee is used to loud the James party, we
were told that James Hall holds the right
to name the party because its members do
the actual work oiputting on the party. Ac-
cordingly. we informed Reg Archambaull,
the president of James Hall, of the circular
lion (if the petition and were told that if
signiﬁcant support, as defined by 500 or
perhaps 550 signatures, was shown {or a
change the name would indeed be changs
ed Wednesday afternoon we presented
Reg with 530 signatures and he assured us
that although he personally favored the old
name, the name would be changed That
evening at dinner he told the woman cola
lecting signatures at Quad, "You don't
have to do that any more. We're going to
change the name."

So much for assurances. Despite Reg's

the complaints lodged against the ac
tivities of lPIRG/MOBE are quite an»
icrenl By perpetually reacting to events
such as the proposed cuts, rather than be
ing actively concerned with instituting a
“better" America, we are “kneejerk.” By
living lifestyles which consume massive
amounts or energy and simultaneously op-
posing nuclear power, we are
“hypocrites."

We are concerned about lhese comments
because they indicate that students don't
think seriously about solar energy. If they
did we would have seen it in at least some
passing interest in the issues involved: the
economic priorities oi the Reagan Ad-

'ministration, the problems hampering

solar technology and so on

Instead, three years at Grinnell have
convinced me that many students believ-
the loilowing: . '

statements to the contrary, the name wa.
not changed and once again the James
party will carry the title "James Gang
Bang." It's frustrating to have condition
set down, meet those conditions and then
be [old that it's not enough It‘s not clea
just what it would have taken to brin
about a change.

The issue of the name of the James Ha!‘
party is not a trivial one, for the use of a
phrase that carries the connotation "grim
rape" as the title of a party is a reflection
of the lack oi concern in our society about
the problem ofviolence against women 1
is diillcull to see how anyone could argue
that no such lack of concern exists when
only this week Newsweek (Nov 2, 1981, p
119i reported that live young
Massachusetts men who pleaded guilty to
gang rape were not sent to jail but were let
on with two years probation and 3500 ilnes‘

One would hope that, inﬂuenced by the,
“enlightened" atmosphere of Grinnell Col-
lege, students would recognizethe need in:
greater sensitivity in our society towards
the problem oi violence against women‘
and work to change this atlilude, Unfors
tunately, the retention of the name
”James Gang Bang" rcinlorces the insen‘
sitive attitude that needs to be changed
It's more than “just a name," ~ Joan
Flynn, Dave Cooke

To the Editor:

As a self-respecting woman on this cans
pus, I cannot let last week's commentar.
on the James Gang Bang controversy pas
without rebuttal. I find the arguments 9
Reg Archambault unconvincing an
rather offensive in themselves.

”James Gang Bang" as referring to A.
