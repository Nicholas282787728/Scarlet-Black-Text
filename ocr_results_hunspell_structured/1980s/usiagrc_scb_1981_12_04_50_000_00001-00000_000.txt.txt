The thoughts of a revolutionary poet

Interview by Seth Melsel
with Laura Capouya
Photos by Joel Aach

We came to Grinnell House all Nady to ask
probing questions on the ’60s. the anger, the
violence and the resentment Mat lingers.
However, Nikki. Giovanni didni wan! to talk
about that, so we tallied for two hours about
utmost everything her son who plays soccer,
her father who [5 coming to terms with old age,
how she likes Hilton: and hates Best Westt'rrls
and yust about everything in between.

Gun/117ml rumbles and, whtle she'll talk about
the mast tnviot things, underneath there is a
definite concern about the human. condition. It
was a [uh interview and me within? include it
all but we did present excerpts from side one of
a 90~minute tape.

son: Could you comment on how you‘ve
changed from being a revolutionary poet
in the ‘60s?

Giovanni: Oh, I don’t think I've changed.
I don't really think I've changed mat
much, and it’s not my job [to comment], I
mean I thought I said that. It‘s really not
my job. It's really somebody else‘s. [don't
think that it's an appropriate time to do a
retrospective on ll'le 'GDs.

5&3: Still?

Ginvann . Well it’s only 20 years first of
all it you just went from the top of the
decade to the top of the decade its only 21
years so that impact is certainly not at all
clear and I think that there is a tendency to
trivialize everything by nostalgia these
days. I mean, the Rolling Stones are
nostalgia. Mick Jagger is still a singer for
the people who are still alive. All of a sud—
den everyone's doing this great retrospect
as if to say “tell me what happened in the
good old days.” I think its kind of early. I
guess it had its charms , but that's it,

55:13: You said you'd become more par
uenL

Giovanni: Yeah, lam more patient. But
people either become more patient or ab-
solutely impatient. But I don‘t think that
has anything to do with the 'Ms or anything
else that just has to do with growing up or
growing older, people change, I don’t
ascribe any great motives to that. I don’t
iind it particularly interesting as you’ve
probably gathered.

8&3: What does interest you?

Giovanni: What we’re going to do when
we find out we’re not the only life in the
universe, How we're going to respond to
life outside of the universal I like Star
Wars; 1 like space. I’m dying for die new
Empire Strikes Back.

said: How does your interest in outer

space relate to your interest in personal
relationships? .

Giovanni: I think what we do with each
other is What we dol Are you a Trekki fan?
Star Trek is really one of the great series
because they did it without realizing they
were making a great statement. One of
their great series is on the Herder. The
Herder is a rockvlike animal that moves
along the ground: you really have to be a
Trekkie fan to appreciate it. Well, or
course they have a colony on this planet
and they iind these periectly round silicon
balls which they take back. Then she starts
to attack them and they wonder, “Why in
the world would she attack them?" So
iinally Spock. it always lakes Spock
because Jim and [the rest of the crew are]
so typically American; thank God they
have a Vulcan. They say, “There she is,
let's go down and destroy her." spock
says, “Let me talk to her,” ”No you can't
talk to this piece of stone."

But he goes down to talk to her and he
iinally realizes that they're killing her
children. ‘fStop killing me children,” [the
rock tells Spock]. Well, if he hadn't taken
the time to talk to her they would never
have known they were killing her children.
She had no trouble with their mining. 1 just
think it’s very typical or us here on earth.
The Arabs have no trouble with selling us
oil, they justwanta fair price for it. Butol
course we prefer to be belligerent. “We're
gonna go fight ior it." It's not just the oil,
it‘s not just anything, it’s all of it.

SBcB: What do you think about the
criticism of NASA that it's a waste of
money to send men to the moon while peo-
1716 here on Earth are starving?

Giovanni: For what little we know about
cavemen human beings have already
taken time to create things, I mean the
Cave drawings are totally the most il-
logical things that exist. why would a man
wiui barely enough to eat, with no warmth
go through the trouble to take a rock and
draw? Obviously there is something about
man’s imagination that remains quite fer-
tile. Why would people in a concentration
camp decide to draw’! Why would we find
poetry written under these horrible cir-
cumstances? Obviously beauty, the
unknown, creativity are very important. I
couldn’t be happier with NASA. lthink we
could spend a little more money and a little
more time in space. I also think we need a
{00] in NASA. We need someone to just
come out and say, “I don't give a damn
whether we make a ball hearing or not
because we donl' know what's out there,
we’re excited about it. It has no practical

' application because we’re not looking for

it. We‘re trying to sell space on the idea
that one day we're going to be able to mine
the moon. And if we’re able ID mine the
moon then someday somebody‘s going to

' be able to gel rich. That's really not the

reason we're going. We're going because
we're lonely dammit: because earth is
lonely Because our cosmic loneliness can
only be assuaged by us going or someone
else coming.

in order to make it possible ior others to
come, we have to also go. We have to let
them know there is something there. Let
life know. What would happen if we in fact
ran into life? If we could show that there is
life on Venus 0r Mars? We would be
destroying it. The first thing we’d want to

do is send up some military expedition to
blow it out of the Water or some religious
expedition to change the people's ways
before we ever knew anything about it
They're heathensl They're not worshipp~
mg the proper god. We're crazy. We're the
ones with the germs, We put the astronauts
into isolation when they come back
What's the difference between that and the
way we treat people who came back irom
Africa and China? It's basically a den
loosing situation. We know from fourth
grade biology that individual self-
preservation is not the hrst law or nature
That's fact, Spectes preservation is. We do
things ror each other whether we intend to,
know it or not. I think that we have to
recognize that we are a species, That the
differences among us should not be as
grant as the similarities, And that's ﬁne
reason I keep cheering for life from outer
space to come. i know the way that people
think: the first time something extremely
different happens, we will all pull together.
Knowing earth, we will all pull together to
destroy that which is extremely different.

But there would also have to be some
recognition that it something came irom
space, identifiable, because there are
uros I don't have any problem
understanding that there are unidentified
flying objects, things that are happening in
space that we are not aware of. There are
things happening in space that nobody par-
ticularly wants to share with human be-
ings. But once we can identify something
else extremely different, the natural fear

of human beings will pull us together, so it ‘

will be interesting to see what happens.
Also, it's just like (and I didn't think much
of the movie) Close Encounters. It’s just
the same concept; the lirst thing is, well,
we can't tell anybody. Those oi us who are
figuring out what's happening, we want to
go see. This is not top secret military. 1
think it something were there, we would
try to conceal it for the most part, I think
we should get used in the idea of other
things out there and I think the iirst way to
get used in the idea is accepting ourselves.

S&B: Do you see humans as being
belligerent all the time?

Giovanni: I had a good friend in high
school who was what they called ”a very
talented football player." He played in the
ninth grade, and he gave it up in the tenth.
You can imagine that in a small town like
Knoxworlh (7), Tennessee, especially for
a young black man, it was a serious thing
for him to decide not to play football so he
was only supported by talks like me. Peo-
ple really stayed on his back, 1 mean
strangers, people that he didn't even know.
He was a local hero, He would just say,
“Why can't everybody have a ball?” and
then he'd walk away and nobody
understood.

But i understood very, very well. You
got 11 guys on one side and 11 guys on
another side. Why can‘t you just buy 22
balls and let everybody run up and down at
their own pace? 1 was always very proud
of him, I remained very proud of him, it
took a lot oi guts just to say, “Hey, I'm not
going to light with you over some ball."

What are we teaching people? I look at
iootball and 1 could probably intelligently
discuss the game as a matter of fact. What
are we teaching our boys when we say,
“Eleven oi you have to drag down n of

them?" Most of the boys end up not doing
pros or anything; they end up with bad
knees, some guys in wheel chairs. ll
played reasonably, it could be a fun game.

5&3: How do you feel now about contem-
poraries like Kathy Boudin?

Giovanni: We need radicals. We also see
that the end result is that what we, as
human beings, need to _be satislied.
Women are not going to go back to law;
Bette Anderson is not an image for young
women. nor Rickie Nelson, Cause Rick is a
little crazy, nor Beaver. People are
leading different lives and that will con-
tinue. You need people who are on the cut
ting edge. You need Kathy Boudins. I’m
sorry that she got caught under the cirr
cumstances. She had been an outstanding
example of a liberal woman Why would
you rob Brinks’.‘ There must be more to it
man that. I think that the Weather
Underground did a great service. ’

Without somebody really pushing, the
rest [the '605 movement] wouldn't have
happened. 1 think that we forget that. We
forget that without the Mark Browns, the
Malcohm X5. the Slokely Carmichaels, or
die Martin Luther Kings, [the '605] could
not have made any sense . . , . Who would
have listened to King without Malcohm X?
He had a little boycott going. Then you got
to Malcolm X and King looked really good;
didn’t he? You always need your people on
the cutting edge. You can't have one
without the other.

SGtB: Have you seen or heard anything
lately that really excites you?

Giovanni: I get excited about a lot of
things for dilierent reasons, but I haven't
had something that I've said, “Well, gee, I
haven't thought about um," What's new?
I looked at the list of Nobel winners and I
thought, “Well if this is what we're rewar-
ding, no wonder everything is so dull." ,
Nothing's new. it we had sent a few poets
to the moon, I think we would have gotten a
different View. We had one astronaut, I
forget his name, who came back and
started telling us how beautiful it was: the
lights and everything. We haven‘t heard
much about him since. But Frank Barman,
he goes up there and he says, “How can I
use this down there?" So he comes back
and becomes president of Eastern Airlines
and turns Eastern around.

These were astronauts that were doing
mind experiments, sending messages
through their minds, and everyone said,
“Well this was obviously too much for
them," Everybody was saying, “What's
wrong with these people?" I think a couple
of poets would have made a big difference.
1 think that a couple of women would make
a big differencel We'd get a whole different
concept of What this planet's like.,
