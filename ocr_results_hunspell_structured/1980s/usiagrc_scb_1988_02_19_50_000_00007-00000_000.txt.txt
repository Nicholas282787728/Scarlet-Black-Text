Columnists Address 3-2 Schedule

John Newmark

In the 13 Columns I have Written
so iar this year, i have concen
trated entirely on issues of national
importance. There was never
anything happening here at Grln-
neil that irightened me enough ior
me to write about. I guess that is
probably good. However,
something has iinally arrived.
Everyone at the college. i'm sure.
has heard by now that Grinnell is
moving to a 3-2 system next year.
This means that professors will
teach three courses one semester
and only two the other, Presently.
prolessors teach three courses
both semesters. Il Grinnell would
increase the number oi proiessors
leaching. and thus guarantee that
every section oi every course
would remain in the Curriculum.
everything ivouid be iine. ii they
don‘t increase the number oi pro-
iessors. though. courses that
students assumed would continue
to be taught for a lolig time might
now be experiencing their iinal
semester.

Originally. the administration
had decided nol to increase the
lacully at all until 1989. Th'ail would
have left the college Will) the same
number or proiessors ior a year. it
would have meant that some
courses would have to be cut. and
that a general use in classroom
size would occur, In addilion. there
was ll omlse that there would be
a signiiicant increase in the faculty
in 1989

A student protest against tlle 372

program was arranged on Friday.
February 12. outside Gardner
Lounge, where the board oi
trustees was meeting. When the
meeting was over, we discovered
the trustees had changed their
minds, New [acuity would he adds
ed next year, We were encouraged.
Someone happened to ask how
many proiessors they planned on
adding. The answer was. threel
The removal of one class for
each proiessor is approximately a
i7-to-ib percent drop in classes
taught. Three professors will not
come close even to scratching that
surface, We were further told that
over tiie ioilowing years more pro»
iessors would be added, but that
we shouldn't expect the entire it
percent I understand that the 372
program is necessary. Professors
need the extra time to prepare ior
Classes and to do research.
However, the administration must
realize that by decreasing the
number oi courses the proiessors
teach without increasing the
number nl proiessors proportional
ly, classes will be lost The ques-
tion. oi course. is which ones.
Without being allowed to
eliminate tutu als. departments
will have to look elsewhere [or
courses that aren't oi particular
importance to the major, These
will probably mostly consist oi inr
troductory IDDrlevel courses. Tltese
general~education courses, which
are naturally the least important
ior the departmental major, are

unfortunately probably the most
important for the college in
general. it the English major can't
find an introductory science course
to take. he or she will probably not
take one The same goes ior the
science major and introductory
English courses These ”intro”
courses cater to the nonsmajor who
has a desire [or a liberalrarts
education. Grinnell. as a liberal-
arts college, should be encourag-
ing us to take these general-
edueation courses However. they
will be among the first to go. it 372
is put into eiiect without enough
proicssors.

Finally. Gl'lnnell runs the ob-
vious risk of raising the average
number of students per class,
While the facultyrsiudent ratio will
remain the same. it will be
misleading with regard to class
size. it there aren't enough pron
fessors to teach three setions oi a
Course. they will try to put the
same number or students in two
sections ii highrschool seniors
were asked why they might choose
logo toasmali liberal-arts college,
a natural answer would be the
smaller-sized classes. Everyone
knows that the larger the class, the
more lectures and the iewer class
discussions there are Students
tend to learn more through discus
Sion environments. A rise in class
size will hurt the students

Grinnell College, like any other

The way I heard It, the situation
went something like this: As the
trustees emerged irom Gardner
Lounge last Friday engaged in a
boisterous change oi “We're
number 10!." they were met by a
group of about 50 students who
were there to express their con-
cern over the unfairness oi the 3-2
program proposal In a gesture
that seems to have become a ritual
oi studentradmlnistration rela-
tions, the students were reassur-
ingly patted on their collective
head and told that the trustees, in
their iniinite generosity. had decid-
ed to allocate sufficient funds to
hire three new protcssors ior next
year.

So next year we can all look for
ward to a substantially reduced
selection oi course options coupled
with a reported increase in class
size of five to in students per
course. This will make individual
contact with a given professor less
feasible. and the education vie
receive will in general be not
unlike that oi the average state
school. We get all this and nothing
more tor the rockabottom Ice of an
eighlstoelbrpcrcent tuition in-
crease. or about 315.000, whichever
makes you less nauseated

The question here is not oi
whether the 372 program is positive .
or not. because it is a move that,
combined with other changes. will
improve the quality oi the school.
If the prois are given more time to
do research, they will be less likely
to continue the trend oi mass ex-
odus which has robbed us or too

many oi our iinest teachers in the
past several years. Similarly, the
research opportunities will be
more enticing to quality educators
who otherwise would do anything
but settle in the middle oi nowhere
excuse me. Iowa.

But once again the administra-
tion has exhibited their proiound
and insulting apathy towards the
current students by reiuslng to
make the changes that should go
handsin-hand with such a Cu!”
riculum alteration,

The college proiesses to have a
studentrfaculty ratio of about
iz-to-i. but how many classes have
you had with less than 15 people in
them? Take me. a second-
semester junior, ior examplc' My
four classes. none ol them intro
courses. have an average or so
students per class, and one oi them
has six people in it ii the average
class size increases by ﬁve or it),
we’ll have to relay the lecture to
the back of the room.

The ultimate insult is the impen-
ding tuition increase. the iourth or
fifth consecutive raise that the
seniors and Juniors have seen it
the money isn't going to pay the
salaries oi some new prois. then
where is it going? Perhaps they
have a ten more payments to
make on the logo, or they're all out
of the gray stationery, Maybe
some oiiices on the west side oi
Park Street need repainting. Hon
do cosmetic expenditures such as
the tombstones and new windows

What to

by Ali Elsatlar

Before starting, let me assure
everyone oi one iact. Over the past
three years i have spent an aim“
ing number or hours working ior
the Student Government Associa
tion tSGAi. holding myriads or
positions, including those at the
very top, both president and vice
preside My role in SGA has been
very visible. indeed. some have
gone so iar as to coniuse me
sometimes with SGA i have been,
ior some. the living impersonation
oi SGA For those oi you who icel
this way. get ready ior a shock,
ilere it is. i have, aiter consulta-
tion with iamily, iricnds, and
associates, decided,,,that i will
NOT seek a third term as SGA vice
president in the upcoming election.

The purpose oi this article is to
ease everyone into the mysterious
postsAli era by lending to all
students, voters, and candidates
insights into the jobs oi president
and vice president, and my views
about what kind oi person can best
iill them. Since indications irom
Grinnell's ever‘productive rumor-
mill are that everyone and their
roommate is considering a run tor
the positions oi SGA president and
vice president tmy count has risen
to as many as is total candidatesi,
ihope my comments will help can
didates decide whether to run.
while helping voters choose good
candidates. I have structured the
article in the term oi a pamphlet
that i would give employers to zisk
questions in interviews with Jill) zips
piicants I begin \\ilh a general
qllcstlon and proceed to explain
why I think the answer to that
question is important since the
voters ultimately are the
employers oi the SGA prcsident

Look for

and vice president. consider this a
guide to hiring your elected
representatives.

Has the candidate ever worked
with thc Grinnell College ad
ministration"

The value oi experience is
portant. although to outsiders.
irequently understood Thcrc
two important sources oi
perienee — experience with
college administration and ex»
perienec with the SGA
bureaucracy. Regarding the ad-
ministration, the greatest value of
experience is in knowing how the
administration works. For exam»
ple. when a student requests
something, does the candidate
know enough about the way Grin-
nell works to detect that it is
unreasonable? Does the candidate
know what problems can be solv»
ed. and what problems cannot be
solved?

A candidate who knows nothing
about the college administration
will be walking into a job in which
he/shc will spend a good deal ol
time working with the administra-
tion. while having no idea how to
work with them. Since all the can-
didates are students of this ﬁne in-
stitulion of higher learning, they
would eventually learn how to
work with the administration But
the term lasts only one year inex-
pcrieilce means that ior part oi
thal y at . the candidate will not be
working ior the students. but will
instead be learning how to repre
sent them, A candidate may be a
last icurncr or may havc other ills
tributes that overcome (his ine'
perienec. But, all things being
equal, the experienced candidutc

will be better able to represent
students over the entire course oi
the term.

Does the candidate have any ex
perience in SGA?

The SGA president and vice
president represent students. but
they also lead the Student Govern-
ment Association. Leading SGA re
quires a diiierent kind oi eXs
perienee, because elected student»
government leaders, in addition to
representing student concerns, are
also SGA equivalents to corporate
chief executive oiiicers tCEOs).
important questions: Does the
candidate care enough about stuV
dent government, and its
bureaucratic tendencies, to
oversee its development, adr
minister to its details, and work to
improve its eiiiciencyi The can-
didate must get involved in 3d.
ministrative details that, lrankly,
some people would iind rather bor»
ing. Would the candidate be in-
terested in them’! The president
and vice president as CEOS have
to be people managers. Can they
manage people? The president and
vice president Jointly appoint peo-
ple to all SGA positions. Can the
candidate judge the abilities oi ap~
plicants [or jobs? Is the candidate
comiortable in choosing some ap~
plicants ior yobs? Is the candidate
comfortable in choosing some ap-
plicants and i-eyecting others" Wlll
the candidate be able to motivate
appomlecs and assurc that they
arc doing their jobs propcrl)"
Assuming that the candidate is in
terestou and capable, docs he/shc
know enough about student
government to understand who
could do it good or bad job to cer-

tain positions? Does the candidate
have the interest and the patience
to deal with the administrative
side oi SGA?

is the candidate able to manage
his/her time?

Eiiective SGA elected leader-
ship involves large amounts oi
time and many responsibilities
My schedule ior today, Friday.
February 19. ior example, may be
extreme, but certainly could hapr
pen to a candidate. i am scheduled
to arrive in my oiiice at 9 a.m. to
iuliill my commitments to oiiice
hours, 1 will be in the oiiice until it
am. at which time i have an ap-
pointment with Mr Duke, dean oi
the iaculty At a pm. Liz Johnson
and i will meet with Vice President
Walker.andat4p,m we meet with
President Drake. The number oi
meetings 1 attend per week, and
the preparation ior them that must
take place beiorehand to assure
that my presence is eiiective,
means that i spend an almost in
sane amount oi time working on
SGA, given that i also try to be a
student. Voters might ask: Does
the candidate have the organiza
tional skills to make these |mp0r~
tant meetings? ii he/she does, docs
he/shc have anything useiul to say
at these meetings? Does the cane
dldalc know how to prepare for a
meeting? How will the candidate
remember all the issues discussed
iind decisions made at those
meetings? Can the candidate
iollow up on Issues? i have had to
resort to an elaborate s stem oi
organization, replete with two sets
oi little black books. to kcep track
or .ill the issucs d-i-ussed in in)
many incctiiigs, Although i

wouldn‘t expect anyone to put
quite as much time or organization
eiiort into SGA as i do. i believe
that eiieetive personal organiza~
tion and managementareessential
to doing a good job. SGA executive
leadership can be demanding. so-
meone not capable oi organizing
those demands will not be an eilcce
tive student leader.

is the candidate capable oi eiiec-
tivcly representing his/her views?

The SGA president alid vice
president are the only students
who speak to the board oi trustees
The president speaks to the alumni
board. The vice president speaks
to the iaculty. Both make speeches
beiore Joint Board every week. To
persuade these groups to their
points orview, they both musthave
good communications skills, ones
tions: is the candidate intimidated
by large groups oi people? Can the
candidate give an eiieetive and
persuasive presentation? The
president and vice president need
not be entrancing public speakers.
But eiiective leadership does re
quire some ability to come
municate,

is the candidate willing to be
somewhat oi a celebrity?

This applies more to the presl~
dent than the vice president, but
either job entails some celebrity
status. without ivantiiig to raise
my importance to unseemly levels.

Grinnell arr accorded ireotmciit
