if you've been wondering why the
organizers of the Vietnam symposium
selected the films they did, there is a good
reason. Overall the films were designed to
help set up the issues and controversies
later addressed in the conference, More
specifically, the film Coming Home (1978),
the most critically and Commercially suc
cessful of the films, was selected to corress
pond with a talk by Professor Rick Berg.
Berg will demonstrate how Coming Home,
a favorite film of liberals, contains a
message as pernicious and propaganistic
as the Green Berels — both preparing
another generation to go to war. Directed
by Hal Ashby, Coming Home deals With
those physically and psychologically
maimed by the war, the unfortunate
Americans who could not escape its fatal
grasp. The story is about Sally (Jane Fons
da), a woman left behind when her huss
band (Bruce Dern) goes to war, and her
“illicit” love affair with Luke (Jon
Voight), a paraplegic veteran, The film
sharply contrasts the different men and
situations in Sally’s life, and also traces
her changes and growth. All the acting is
excellent, but Voight gives the dominant
performance. He captures Luke's rage
and frustration, arrogance and
tenderness. One of the most powerful
scenes in the movie comes when Voight
speaks to a group of high school boys about
avoiding the draft; he brings home the war
and the sentiments’of the time, reminding
one of the choices that had to be made

At the opposite end or the spectrum (or
maybe not so far away if you agree with
Berg) is John Wayne's The Green Berets
(1968, 141 min.) Made right in themiddle of
the war, this film is a mouthpiece for John
Wayne (who produced and cordirected)
and his views on the American role and
presence in the war. Relentlessly
simpieminded, propagandistic and
chauvanlstic aptly describes the film's
treatment of an obviously complex and
profound subject.

Another film dealing with the actual coma
bat side of the War is the outstanding Go
Tell the Spartans (1978,!” min), starring
Burt Lancaster. The film deals with a
group of American advisers in 1964 with
Lancaster as the frustrated but loyal coma
mander of the group, lie has to deal with
the orders given him which spell disaster,
and an lllrequipped and illrmotivated
soldiery, Lancaster is torn between his iris
stincts and his loyalty; he knows that his
duty this time is sheer maddness, but he is
unable to avoid it. The picture. filled with
integrity and authenticity, captures the
absurdity and futility of Lancaster's
operation and the war as a whole.
Understated with a realistically a ti-
heroic air, this film may be the definitive
statement about the lessons and legacies
of the war.

The least well-known 0f the Vietnam films
is Cutter's Way (1581) (also released under
the title of Cutler and Bone), another of the
films to be discussed by Berg, This film
deals with Cutter (John Heard) a vet who
lost an eye, arm and leg in Vietnam and is
“crazy angry" about it, He drinks too
much, emotionally abuses his wlfe M0
(Lisa Eichhorn) and becomes fatally ins
volved with Bone (Jeff Bridges). The film
is a mystery of sorts, with acute social
commentary, as Cutter gets caught in a
scam he can't get out of, Though not
directly about Vietnam, the film is
perhaps more pertinent to the era than any
of the other films. All the performances
are excellent. especially Heard. He retains
his humanity while going over the edge
psychologically, The film makes the
viewer care about the losers without at-
tributing heroic virtues to them.

Synge's ‘
"Playboy"

to charm
audiences

by Kevin McKeough

Playboy of thc WesteriiWorld.John Mill-
ington Synge's examination of the human
ego as it influences the inhabitants of an
lrish peasant village, will be presented
this Thursday through Saturday,
November 11713. Synge’s dramatic coma
edy will be performed each evening in
Robert's Theatre at a p.m.

According to Director Sandy Moffet,
Synge saw “a romantic quality" in the
peasants who populated Northwest
lreland, in Synge‘s comedy, Christopher
Mahon falls in with such peasants while
fleeing his murder of his abusive father,
played by John Nicoison. Mahon, porr
trayed by Christopher Taylor. immediate-
ly becomes a hero to the village's i
habitants. By glorifying Mahon's deed, the
townspeople transform Mahon into what
Moffet calls “a hero, carrying out the
wishes of everyone." In fact, Mahon has
acted out a heroic act that everyone can
relate to." Influenced by the villagers ads
julation, Mahon, a “totally introverted,
tyranized person” quickly acquires
previsouly unknown confidence and ag-
gressmn. which he retains even after the
townspeople desert him.

World.” Photo by Pat Smith.

Premiering at the irish National
Theatre, Playboy of the Western World
was greeted with riots, incited by those
who relt that the artistocratic Synge‘was
insulting the irish common people Moffet
admitted that the characters who populate
the play “turn out to be a black lot,” Yet he
feels Synge “Was celebrating the irish
character, rather than defiling (it)." The
love of the Irish common man is ex-
emplified by Synge’s elevation of
idiomatic lrish speech into high poetry,
While imbuing the peasant characters
with a grand eloquence, Synge
manipulated common diction with a
skillfullness Moffet feels is excelled only

Fellowship, Kindred, etc. Only Good
Deeds will accompany him to the
grave.

Two vocalists, Douglas Morris, a
baritone who is on the Ripon College
faculty, and Albert Gammon, a bass
who is a faculty member at the Univer»
sity of iowa, will join the trio in presen-

by Shakespeare.

The poetic dialogue and strong humor
that mark Playboy of the Western World
contributed to the selection of the play as
this semester's major theatrical produc-
tion, Moffet was enthusiastic about the
progress of the show, whose cast includes
veteran Grinnell actors Kate Jackson,
John Kerr, Carol Cadby. Lou Kersten,
Joey Walsh and Roy Goodman, Next
weekend’ 5 production of Playboy of the
Western World will provide Grinnell
students with a fine opportunity to see this
much acclaimed but rarely produced
drama.
