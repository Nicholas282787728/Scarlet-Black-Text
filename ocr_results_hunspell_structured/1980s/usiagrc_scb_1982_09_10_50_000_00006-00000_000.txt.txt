BEST BET. . , without a doubt is Chariots
of Fire (1981), Believe all ﬁle wonderful
things said about this 1931 Academy
Award winner, for they‘re all true. This
film deals with runners Harold Abrahams
{Den Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian
Charlesonl, and the factors which affect
their running. Abrahams, outwardly ar-
rogant, constantly fights painfuuy subtle
discrimination (caught beautifully in the
scene with the desk-clerk) and Vents much
of his frustration in his running. Con-
trasting passions are present in Liddell, a
pious. noble Christian running for the
"Glory of God In fact, at one point, he
chooses to not participate in the qualifying
race for the 1924 Olympics to avoid breakr
ing the Sabbath by running on a Sunday,
The end of the film is emotionally satisfyr
ing as all the elements of the film come
together in a bi‘illant climax. This movie is
so sensational, it must be seen to be believ-
ed. Every aspect of this picture, technical,
emotional and thematic, is skillfully and
artfully done The past emerges and the
Viewer returns to Cambridge in 1924. Some
may argue that the film is too amy, too
selfindulgent; those who say that do not
fully appreciate the caretul, loving technir
que with which this film was made. If you
do nothing else all weekend, see this
movie; and with it being shown all three
nights, there is no good excuse not to

A GOLDEN OLDlE . . .the first and best of
the Bogie and Bacall films, To Have and
Have Not (19447 This Howard Hawks
Classic has lots of romance, intrigue and
wellrknown Bogartism — “If you want
anything, just whistle . " Very loosely
based on the Hemingway novel of the same
name, this film served as a final vehicle
for Lauren Bacall, in this her first feature
film. She scandalized 1944 audiences with
her sultry delivery of such lines as "it's
even better when you help” in response to
Bogie's passionate kiss. Hawks groomed
Bacall for months before putting her on
film and the work pays off. Bogart plays
Harry Morgan, a fisherman who, in the
course of catching Nazis, manages to
romance Bacall. A movie definitely worth
spending time on.

OK A SERIOUS NOTE . . . is Volker
Schldndorft's The Tin Drum (1980), winner
of the Oscar for best foreign film, A film
filled with images that can only he called
horrific and memorable. The movie
chronicles the life and times of Oskar
Matzerath, a eryear-old boy who decided
to stop growing physically at the age of
three, This act of will is his means of lime
testing the obscenity at an adult middle
class existence full of sex, violence and
cruelty. He also uses his piercing scream
and tin drum to show his disgust and revul-
sion at the world around him. Rather than
just a restatement of the German-Nazi ex-
perience. this film stands full of significant
and shrewd observations of a very real
\\Dl‘ld, Though at times very painful to
watch, this brilliantly imaginative
allegory requires full attention interest.

DON'T FORGET . . . On Wednesday and
Thursday the second in the series of Wajda
films, Kaila]. will be shown in September
of 1944. as the advancing German army
completes its destruction of Warsaw, a
tired group of soldiers and patriots flee
from the city and descend into the sewers
in an attempt to obtain thalr freedom.
What happens thereafter is difficult to
watch, but penetrating none the less, as
WaJda explores the crushed spirit of a
twice defeated Poland, It is not a pleasant
viewing experience, but a grim recogni-
tion of the struggle required to achieve
personal and national liberty The dlreCV
tlon acting and cinematography are all
first rate. Though shown midrweek, this
film definitely deserves to be considered a
worthy study break

Joe Jackson's
return

by Daniel Klatz

Joe Jackson is one of the most i
teresting personalities in popular music.
His first two albums revealed an angry
young man, disgusted with personal rela-
tionships, social customs and the trapp-
ings of human contact, On his third album,
the anger turned to microscopic observa
tion and the findings were even more pain
ful. That album, “Beat Crazy,” was an
amazing record, so painful it forced
Jackson to totally depart from his own
music and cut an album that payed tribute
to the “good time" swing of Louis Jordan.
“Night and Day" is his return to die pre-
sent. It is his most advanced work to date,
both musically and lyrically, and one of
the finest albums released this year.

“Night and Day” is like nothing Jackson
has ever recorded. It transforms him into
an urban journeyman, wandering through
the city e lost, confused and searching for
happiness. 0n “Chinatown” he stumbles
through the streets, finding dirt, crime and
unhappy faces, “rv, Age” plugs right into
the remote control cesspool of modern
society with horrified anger. This may
sound like dark stuff, but ironically
Jackson surrounds it with upbe . salsa
flavored music. He tells us on “Cancer"
that no subsmnce is safe, but the music
does the reverse 7 it's jazzy and full of
life.

What ls finally revealed is that Jackson
simply wants to be ”caressed," “undress-
ed" and "romanced" by the sweetness of
“A slow Song."

”Night and Day" is a great step forward
for Joe Jackson. His anger no longer
dominates his work: It now provides the ma
spiration necessary to create truly lﬂr
teresting musw, That skill is the most um,
oue among rock musicians and makes
“Night and Day" a most unique album,

Oldie of the Week

In used record stores and cutrout bins all
over America, copies of ”Muswell
Hillbillies" are waiting to be bought, en-
joyed and possibly worshiped.

Question: What is it?

“Muswell Hillbillies" is one of the first
albums The Kinks ever recorded and con-
sequently one of rock’s greatest treasures.

It’s a visit with people time misplaced,
schizophrenics, drunks, the unemployed
and a wide range of othercharacters. It is

a visit with Ray Davies, from the point of

view an anaylfst might have,

Using the British Music Hall as a
backdrop, you are escorted through the
world of common men, women and freaks.
Stops along the way will be funny,
pathetic, charming and always in-
teresting. No love song here; not “You
Really Got Me,"not ”Lola,” save those for
a party.

This is a record to be enjoyed late at
night, as the world sleeps, Only then can
you be fully taken away to the world of The
Kinks. a world where socil misfits
welcome visitors to rock's strangest
utopia.
