Citizen’s Party
candidate to
speak today

by Brian Kendall

As the Democratic presidential
candidates criss-cross the state,
rushing to get in front oi as many
people as possible and deliver
rhetorical speeches, a new face
and voice, one or vigor and ilair, is
bringing iorth an alternative to
the Democrats and Reagan, Sonia
Johnson, a woman long united
against the principle or two-party
politics and a Citizen Party
Presidential candidate will be ap-

Askew fizzles in Forum

by Patrilia Westfield

South Lounge once againwas
buzzing Tuesday, February 14,
when presidential hopeiul Reubin
Askew spoke, The lounge,
however, was not nearly as
Crowded as it had been for
Cranston‘s and McGovern’s
speeches and many students min-
tioned that they “came not to sup-
port Askew, but to hear what he
had to say.”

This campaign stop by Askew
was oi particular signiiicance
because it was covered by the na
tional networks. Roger Mudd was
one oi the many top media people
on campus who presented na-
tlonal coverage at the speech.

Askew began his speech by calls
ing himself the “different
Democrat,” His overriding theme
throughout the speech was the
need for “incentive," In terms of
trade, America needs to meet the
competition, said Askew, Having
been Chief US, Foreign Trade
Representative, Askew advocates
a more open trade in order to imr
prove America’s economy. He
feels that mis is what the con-
sumer wants, and that his position
is in the best interest of the con-
sumer.

Bearing in mind that he was
talking primarily to a college au-
dience, Askew discussed his posts
tinn on education and his beliefs
with regard to the young people or
the country. If elected, Askew
would increase graduate
iellowships and Guaranteed Stur
dent Loans, Again, he noted that
“incentive" is the key. Also, more
should be done in National Ser-
vice, and there should be a
rebuilding of the Peace Corp and

the Civilian Corp. Government
and business should work together
to accomplish these goals Accors
ding to Askew, we are “a nation
built on free enterprise,” but we
have taken capitalism and
restrained it.

Turning to the next issue.
Askew discussed disarmament.
Askew is the only democratic can-
didate who does not support a
nuclear freeze, but desires renew-
ing talks with the East, “A freeze
makes it impOSSible for the United
States to improve its military
forces — improvements that are
needed to force the Soviets to the
bargaining table. A President who
promises a ireeze would be torced
to produce one quickly, while the
Soviets would be able to demand
terms more favorable to them."
He stated that the U.S. has a
responsibility to the entire world
to cut down on our nuclear
weapons, He never mentioned
how he would do this but said the
U.S. must be‘ persuasive and
maintain discipline in arms
reduction.

The floor was then opened to
questions. The first was from an
anti-abortionist who wanted to
know Askew’s stand on abortion,
Askew is the only Democratic
candidate who is against women's
right to abort. He feels there
should he a national decision. To
do so would require that the issue
be taken from the courts and plac-
ed in the House of Represen-
tatives. Askew does not believe
that the Constitution was meant to
cover abortion. Therefore, there
should be a Constitutional amend-
ment to reverse Roe vs, Wade (the
1973 Supreme Court decision mat

The Joint Board meeting
Wednesday night was the scene of
some hot debating, some contu-
sion, and little action, The most
significant result of the debating
was that the nomination of David
Kopelman tor chairperson oi the
Committee on Student Politics
(C.S.P.) was withdrawn and ﬁle
position reopened ior applicans
from the student body.

Kopelman was chosen for the

position after interviews, made
available to U.S.P. members only,
were held Monday night. Accor-
ding to Pete Hautzinger, only two
applicants from the committee
were interested in the position left
vacant after Marc Lambert's
resignation last week.

However, Hatuzinger’s nomina-
tion oi Kopelman for the position

Ms. Johnson has a doctorate
irom Rutgers University and has
taught, over the last fifteen years,
in universities and colleges across
the country. She gained national
news headlines when in December
1981, these words were directed to
her: ”The decision of this court is
that you are excommunicated
from the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints," Johnson was
excommunicated from the Mor-
man Church for her stance in op-
posing Morman organizing
against the Equal Rights Amends
merit (ERA).

Leading the last ditch effort for
passage of ERA in Illinois,
Johnson and seven others fasted
tor thirtyseven days. In Sonia’s
struggle ior an independent
women‘s movement she ran for
the presidency oi the National
Organization ior Women (NOW)
under a plattorm oi activism,
which included making NOW less
patriarchal and more feminist,
more activist, taking stands on
reproductive and lesbian rights,
and taking a stronger oppositon to
the twoparty system.

In a civil disobedience action
organized by Johnson and aimed
against Reagan policy toward
women, she with others chained
themselves to the White House
fenceonWomen‘sEqualityDayin
August 1951.

Johnson disagrees with the
ioreign policy of the present ad-
ministration, and many oi the
ideas put forth by the Democrats,
concerning the issue of nuclear
weapons she has said: “We’ll pros
bably have about the same
amount of time to live an die
planet under either Mondale or
Reagan. ...the Democrats are
dangerous. They are strongly
Committed to the military.”

Johnson iavors bringing the
Marines home for the Mid-east
and Central America. “We ought
to stop intervening. Our present
policy in Central American is im-
perialist, immoral, and illegal,"

Trustees

by Jen Raymond

An increase in the comprehen
sive fee by $910, including a $724
jump in tuition, was approved by
the Board of Trustees last
weekend and is being announced
to students and parents today in a
letter by President George Drake.

The second highest single in-
crease is in room charges, going
up $110. Tuition will be $7,594,
room will be $960, full board will
rise to $1,385 and the full fee will
stand at $10,150.

In the letter, Drake mentions
that the full fee will still cover our
ly as percent oi each student’s iull
cost. The rest is made up in gins
and from the endowment.

Drake further states that last
year’s SIX percent rise was the

she said

Johnson is devoted to a nuclear-
lree world. She would cut the
military budget to 50 percent or its
present level; reduce the number
oi nuclear weapons by onerthird,
unilaterally, and begin a full-
employment economy by iunding
social services such as child care,
housing, mass transit, and educa-
tion.

Johnson does give the
Democram a little credit for mar
domestic issues. She states, “the
Democrats take different
economic stands Mondale
would increase the military
budget, but probably less tthan
the Republicans). That might be
better for women and minorities if
only because cuts in domestic pro»
grams wouldn’t be so much. In the
long run we're still going to be in
trouble.”

As to her economic program,
Jounson says, “The best I’ve seen
is the program put iorth in the
book, ”Beyond the Wasteland,”
by Sam Bowles, Tom Weiskopf,
and David Gordon. It’s a program
for economic democracy, of
workers having a say.”

The 19805 will be a time for
change. it is possible that many
people are not willing to accept
the ideology oi a mum party can-
didate, but in the best interest of
the country, it is necessary that
the best candidate be elected. In
order to Cast the best possible
ballot, the voter must investigate
all the possible tickets.

Sonia Johnson will be giving
Grinnell students the chance to
expand their knowledge oi issues
which the two major parties
neglect, Most importantly, she is
coming here so that we may
become more aware of all the
alternatives in 1934, and thus cast
the best possible ballot in
November.

smallest of the decade and that
the increases are still much
smaller than those made at coma
parable institutions. in tact, oi the
30 colleges that received a Sloan
Foundation Grant, Grinnell is lass
costly than all but one of the
schools.

To pick up the slack in funds
thatis sure to follow in the wake of
the increases, the financial aid
budget has also been increased.

Drake, in me letter, says that
the increases are “necessary and
reasonable” because of the in
creasing costs of maintaining the
quality oi the school. According to
the President, ”, . . lowering
quality to meet current costs is

not an appropriate option for an
institution like Grinnell.”
