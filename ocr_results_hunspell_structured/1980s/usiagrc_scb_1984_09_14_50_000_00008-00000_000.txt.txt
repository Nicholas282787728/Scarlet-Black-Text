dorm life is important, But. he
claimed that there are also many
differences.

He commented that Grinnell is
more sophisticated. well-funded.
betterrstalfed, and offers more
services than when he was here.
Emphasizing diversity. Drake
called today's Grinnell more “na
tional". Drake also said that there
are more faculty and more
ni inority students on campus now.
Drtike said that the food has "11'
proved since he was a student
here. Dorms. he recalled. were
singlersex; thus, students' rela
tionships with the opposite sex
depended entirely on dating,

One area Drake said he would
like to sec updated is that of
library books. According to
Drake. the problem is monetary;
the average book costs approx~
imately 340.

About the library holdings
Drake said. “We are not as strong
as we should be." but later Called
the collection “pretty good". He
Said that the librarians have done
an excellent job selecting books
with the available funds. Accor»
ding to Drake. 'one 'of the reasons
that the library has not been kept
up to date is the fact that some of
the money that might have been
allocated to buying books has
gone toward computers Drake
acknowledged that this is a pro
blem but said that he does not see
a solution, He said that Grinnell
should not stop funding corn»
puters.

Drake named Burling's
periodical collection as another
troublesome area. He said that
some oi the periodicals may
not serve the student's interest
because of their specialized sub-
iect matter. Drake emphasized
that the book problem is of
greater concern to him,

Drake said he believes that the
general direction in which the col»
lege is headed is the right one. He
hopes that Grlnnell will Continue
to graduate people who w.il be
leaders.

a series including profiles of some
of Grinnell's most influential
decision-makers.

New faces at student affairs
The new director of minority affairs

by Rebecca Weston

“An important part of my job is
to eradicate misconceptions of
black, students and other
minorities.” Said new Director of
Minority Affairs Quentin Johnson.
Johnson, who obtained a degree in
college and university ad
ministration from Bowling Green
State University. would like to
establish what he called a “Fire
Side Chats" program to begin se-
cond semester.

Based in the Black Cultural
Center (BCC). the program would
be available to all students.
Through these informal discus
sions led by students. Johnson
hoped to spur interest and involve
ment in interracial and ethnic
discusSlons.

Johnson’s primary iunction in
the network of the Grlnnell ad
ministration is “to help students
develop to their fullest potential.“
regardless oi their race, He said
he would like to “encourage diar
logue between students oi var-
ious backgrounds from which st-
udents can grow,” and said. “We
need to strengthen our commit
ment to understand each other."

Having been at Grinnell ior ap-
proximately two months, Johnson
has had time to gather many im-
pressions about the college com-
munity — both positive and
negative. He expressed en-
couragement by the respon-

siveness of the administration and
called Grinnell “an environment
for human growth. a college that
is a melting pot of all people, a
positive moving force. different
from colleges nationWide.”

However. Johnson expressed
displeasure. Perhaps the biggest
cause of disappointment for
Johnson stems from the BCC,
Though it is designed for all
students, only a small segment of
the student body takes advantage
of the BCC. Johnson would like to
see more emphasis placed on and
greater use of the center to pro-
mote communication between all
races.

Furthermore. Johnson would
like more “soda/cultural ac-
tiVlties designed to encourage
interrracial communications at all
levels within the entire Grinnell
community."similar to the“Fire-
Side Chats" program.

He said the “media does a pretr
ty good job oi being sensitive,
though it still does not meet the
needs of all students." Johnson
continued by saying, “It must be
conscious of the different races on
the campus."

When asked why he ran his
position of Director of Student
Services at Indiana Vocational
Technical College, Johnson said
that he had heard about the coir
lege and wanted to be a part oi the

“unique blend of students. staff
and iaculty. lwherel the quality or
life" and level of communication
“is by design rather than by acclr
dent."

Johnson has arranged for
Human'Rights Specialists Drs.
Frattorolli and Addison to speak
in South Lounge in early October.
They will be speaking on the “imr
plications and manifestations of
culture on education and institur
tions." Johnson said. He clted this
as another way ior students to
gain exposure to other cultures
and ethnic groups on campus,

Sophomores - Slash

by Barry Kokleisky

Upon coming to Grinnell, 3
popular question asked of new
students by other new students is
“Why did you choose Grinnell?”
And, a common response is “I
would have gone to .. . but Grinr
nell was much cheaper."

According to one senior.
however, a great many ups
perclassmen had their aid
packages reduced. despite in-
creasing fees to the college, as
well as increased personal ex-
penses. In her case. the financial
aid Officer stated that she had a
Signlficant amount oi savings to
warrant the decrease in aid.

“As a rule." she said. “a stuV
dent‘s aid package goes down “

0n the other hand, two
members on the admission com~
miltee. as well as the Director Of
Admissions and Financial Aid,
John Hopkins. strongly disagree
with this idea.

Political Science professor Bob
Grey. a newcomer to the admis-
sions committee. said that he
would be surprised if the Finanr
cial Aid Office took away aid from
upperclassmen to attract
freshmen to Grinnell. Both
Hopkins and Waldo Walker. the
executive vice president of the
college, assert that a student
receives less aid solely because of
changes in family income. or
some other personal iactor.

When questioned about the
financial aid differential between
freshmen and upperclassmen.
Hopkins replied that all aid is
given out according to need. no
matter what class a student is in.
As far as attracting freshmen is
Concerned. he said that Grinnell
offers more grants than many oi
its competitors.

“Yale, for example. will give a
student with a $3000 need. a job
and loan. while Grinnell will give
him or her a grant for that
amount." '

In addition. Hopkins noted that
Grinnell strives to have a needs
blind admissions policy. Only dur
ing the preceding two years have
students been denied aid (but of-
fered admission). due to a
decrease in the school's budget.
This year, according to Hopkins.
the admissions office reinstated
its need-blind policy.

Walker gave another reason for
this aid difference.

“Because there are no ‘startup
costs'. for upperclassmen, like
rugs. bulletin boards. and so forth.
as there are for freshmen.
generally, there is a $150-$200
reduction in the returning
student’s aid package.” Walker
attributes this year’s larger
freshman class to a return to a
need blind admissions policy.
where more students were offered
aid as well as admissxon. The ex
ecutive vice president also
asserted that. although admiSr
sions and iinancial aid are ad
ministered In one office. each
decision is made separately.

The reason for there being one
office for both functions is, as
Hopkins said. “because we are a
small college. and it would be
more difficult if these two Offices
were separate."

When asked about whether or
not the college will have enough
money to aid all of this year's
ireshmen, next year, all three
said that this will not be known un-
til the trustees meet late this
semester.
