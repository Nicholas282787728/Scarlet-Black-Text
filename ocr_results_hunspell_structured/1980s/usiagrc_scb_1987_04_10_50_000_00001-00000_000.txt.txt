Zoeller, an assistant professor of

factor was “considerable social pressure
to conform to the prevailing provincial life
style” at Grinnell. “The intellectual and
social life style that my wife (Marlena

Leaves shrink political
science department

by Dave Jones

During the [$7M sdlool ywr, associate
professor Ira Strauber and associate pro-
fessor Wayne Moyer of the political
science department will be on sabbatical.
This, coupled with the recent resignation
of instructor Gretchen Casper, has raised
questions about the immediate future of
the department and its ability to maintain
its quality.

"Obviously, this is not a situation that
anyone would consider desirable,” said
Meyer. The department has already hired
a political scientist as a two-year replace-
ment, Pita. Agbese. an international
relations and comparative-politics
specialist, will replace Moyer and Straub-
her during their leaves. He will then stay
on for 1933-89 in the place of professor
Robert Grey, who will be on sabbatical.

By'replacing both Moyer and Strauber
with only one person, the department will
suffer the loss of a few courses Political
Philosophy, and Constitutional Law and
Policies. both taught by Strauber, ivill not

be offered in 1987-88, However, Agbese will '

cover the international-politics courses
taught by Moyer With his duties as head of
the Rosenfield Program. Moyer serves on-
ly half-time as a teacher.

The search for Caspers replacement is
now underway, The position will be a one
year appointment. A iullscale. nation-
wide search will then be made for a per-
manent replacement to serve beginning in
the lall of 1988

”in a sense there are costs, but I don't
think they are high costs," said Grey,
chairman of the department. He added
that the series of academic leaves Will give

the department great stability fonthe four
or five years after its conclusion. Moyer
too sees his leave as beneficial to the
department. He said that his leave was
"important for my teaching," since he will
be able to update his course after catching
up on the newest theories in his field.

Yet for many political-science majors,
the positive aspects of the upcoming
leaves have been hard to see, “I would be
severely distressed if I were an
underclassman," said Jennifer Bishop,
senior. “I don’t think they realize what the
effects of this gap might be." Bishop's
comments were echoed by sophomore
Marka Petersen. who said that many
underclassmen “knew something about
the turnover, but not its full extent."

The upcoming leaves also have promp-
ted speculation as to a possible decline in
the number of politicalrscience majors.
Sophomore Petersen said, "It makes a dif-
ference .,.if it (announced leaves) had
happened earlier, and i had some options,
1 might have reconsidered the major.”

A potential complication for the depart
ment may lie ahead in the 1988789 school
year In the fall of 1988. Strauber will be
teaching at the Grinnell Technology
Semester in Washington. D.C. When he
returns, because of his course schedule he
will leach only one political~science
course, most likely the introductory-level
course. This creates the need for the
department to hire a political scientist for
the 1983439 year 10 cover Political
philosophy and Constitutional Law. or
those courses will not be offered until the
fall of 1989.

 

Congressman discusses
conservative agenda

by Dave Jones

Last Sunday. Oklahoma Republican
Congressman Mickey Edwards spoke on
the conservative agenda for the future of
American politics. Edwards. an eleven
year member of the House, is most noted
for his sponsorship of the recent bill that
Sent $100 million to the Nicaraguan Cons
tras. As a member or both the House ap-
propriations and budget committees, Ed-
wards has been a key player in many con-
gl'cssional issues and is considered by
many to be one of the most influential
Republicans currently serving in the
House.

Scarlet and Black: What do you think the
passage of the highway bill over Reagan's
veto says about the end of his Presidency?

Mickey Edwards: 1 think it was ab-
solutely essential for the President to
determine that he was committed to being
a strong leader, and that he was willing to
make a major. effort to get his program
passed. 1 don't think it was really lmpor»
tant whether he won or lost. I think it pro
bably strengthened him rather than
weakening him

Scarlet and Black: What is the future of
Contra ald'.’

Edwards: 1 think that depends a lot on/

the Contras, By the time there's another
vote. say September or october, they will
have had the first 360 million of that $100
million for nearly a year. so they will have
to show some results. i don't know what
those results will be, whether they will
hold some territory or merely have caused

some significant damage to the Sandinista
government, But, they can’t still be hang-
ing around the camps in Honduras saying
“one of these days we're going to go out
and do something," they have to prove
they can get public support and prove that
they can be militarily effective. if they’ve
done that, i think they’ll get the $105
million

Scarlet and Black: What Republican
backed issues have suffered due to the loss
of control in the Senate? '

Edwards: The President’s veto would
have been sustained if there had been a
Republican Senate. On most issues it's a
little hard to tell because, for example, the
budget fights, the appropriations fights
haven’t happened yet Probably, it has
weakened us in a lot of areas. ..i suspect
that when we get to the defense bills that
difference will be noticed.

Scarlet and Black: Have you seen a dif*
terence in Reagan's ability to encourage
cross-partisan voting and Jimmy
Carter’s7 1

Edwai , 0n the vote on my amend-
ment to th Contra aid issue last June we
had 50 Democrats vote with us, and alot of
that was because of the President. Jimmy
Carter didn't have the ability to persuade
anybody of either party to go along with
him because it was important to him.
when his views coincided with those of the
Democratic party, they went along vviih
him

among the Republicans, although i'm sup-
