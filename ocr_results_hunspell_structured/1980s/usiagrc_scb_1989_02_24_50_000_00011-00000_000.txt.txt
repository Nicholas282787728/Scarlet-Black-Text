What abilities do you have that you are

especially proud of“?

Paul Froese

I can whip up one hell of a
cheese omelet. Also. I’m very
proud of my poetry. Here's one
that I wrote especially for this
election.

I've worked pretty hard

To make my message clear
I‘d like to be your president
In the upcoming year

Hopefully you are impressed

Rob Killian

My ability to get along with
other people. It’s very easy in an
organization like SGA, or any
sort of political activity, to be
sucked into personal conflicts and
petty grievances among your co-
workers. I like to drink that I
tend to be one of the people who
resolves those conﬂicts and tries
to mediate those conﬂicts. rather
than someone who gets sucked
into them. And I think that also
carries over into my relationship
with administrators and faculty
members. I don’t view them as

my enemy or SGA's enemy or
the student body‘s enemy. Many
times our interests are very
different, and many times I've
become angry with them, but I
try to keep in mind that ulti-
mately otlr goals are the same,
that of making Grinnell College
the best place for students it can
possibly be. So I always make
sure, though I might be in an
argument with a particular
administrator and be angry with
that administrator, I keep that in
check and I don’t let it interfere
with my effectiveness in
negotiating with them.

Simon Levin

I ﬂatter myself with feeling I
have a good sense of humor, I do
crack corny jokes occassionally,
I'm easy to work with. I have a
pleasant. positive attitude.
Generally I’m prone to clear
thinking and articulate speaking.
Being an SA helped out with that
and that‘s part of the reason I was
chosen as an SA. I am also very
goal-oriented, and again, I have
tried in the past and will continue
to try to affect change. I think
that’s a contagious ability that
motivates other people.

If you lose, what are your plans for next year?

Paul Froese .
No comment. I live for the
moment.

Rob Killion

To be honest, I‘m not sure.
That is something I’ll have to
consider carefully after the
election. should I lose. SGA has
become a major part of my life,
and a lot of who I am
emotionally right now is tied up
with SGA. It would, on the one
hand, be difficult for me to apply
for a Cabinet position and,
assuming I was appointed, serve
on Cabinet next year because it’s
a very different level of
involvement as a Cabinet
member and as the president or
vice-president. It would be
difficult for me in that respeCt.
0n the other hand, I think it
would also be very difficult for
me to disassociate myself from
SGA entirely because I enjoy
doing SGA work immensely,
What I can say for sure.

You were responsible for restructuring the films committee,

enough non—popular
films. What's your
reaction to the
criticism?

Rob Killiori -

I will address the criticisms in
a little bit because I don't think
they deal direcLly with any of the
restructuring that we did. The
restructuring that you refer to is a
proposal that Joe Lewis, Greg
Evans, Ali ElSaffar, and myself
made to Joint Board and that
Joint Board approved last year.
What it provided for was that the
films and concerts committees
would have to meet regularly and
that, in the case of the films

regardless of whether or not I
apply for Cabinet or try to stay
involved in SGA one way or
another next year, is that Greg
and I will do our best to give as
much knowledge from our
experience this year to whoever
was Clecttxl as vice-president and
as president, and help give them a
head start on next year.

Simon Levin

I still plan on pushing for the
changes that I‘m proposi g right
now. I think the possi ty that
these changes will be instituted
will be less because I won't have
the power and position of SGA.
Plus some of the changes I want
to do are in SGA itself and the
best position to make these
changes is as the head of SGA.
If I’m not elected I have other
interests and pursuits I want to
follow. One is participation in
the Urban Studies Program in
Chicago.

committee, no film could be
selected unless it was done so by
majority vote. Formerly it was
up to the discretion of the films
and concerts chairs. If they
wanted ID form a committee and
have them meet, that was fine, It

, was also fine if they chose not to

do that. We felt that that wasn‘t
in the best interests of the student
body and that wasn‘t in the
tradition of democratic sclfr
government. In addition, we
asked the administration to hire a
full—time support person who
would work in the Forum with
the new SGA social coordinator
and the films and concerts chairs
to help them book films and
concerts in a more productive
way and in a cheaper way. We

give it to people who need it.
Everybody has a room on
campus. Everybody cats in a
dining hall. Everybody when they
leave Grinnell is going to make
three billion dollars. I don't
think we need it. I'd give it to
the needy.

Rob Killion

Three areas. First of all, the
faculty size needs to be increased
greatly. One way to do that is by
allocating more money for an
increased faculty. The college
also needs to provide more
incentives for faculty to come to
Grinnell, Iowa. Whether that‘s
higher salaries, increased job
beneﬁts, or loan forgiveness is
up to the college to decide. But I
definitely think that the
faculty needs to be increased
dramatically. I‘d also like to see
student financial aid expanded.
Currently, Grinnell has what they
call a "noneed policy". In theory

'that policy asssures that any

student who qualifies
academically to attend Grinnell
will receive all the help he/shc
needs financially. I'd like to see
more resources placed in, first of
all, helping the student body in
general ﬁnancially, going beyond
no need. I think that would make
Grinnell more attrractive to
students, and I also think it
would make life after Grinnell a
lot easier, with less loans to pay

back, less of a debt that's going
to haunt you after you graduate
from either Grinnell or a graduate
school. I'd also like to See more
ftnanein aid resources going to
the recruitment of people of
different ethnic backgrounds.
One of Grinnell's stengths, 1
think, is the ethnic and cultural
diversity on campus. Butl think
we can also go a lot further than
we have, especially in recruiting
AsianrAmericans and Hispanic-
Americans. I think increased
financial aid and a special
emphasis on grants over loans for
particular ethnic groups will
beneﬁt the college dramatically in
terms of ethnic and cultural
diversity. Thirdly, I think I'd like
to see the library budget increased
dramatically. Our library is
adequate at but for a college of
Grinnell's caliber. I think that's
been the consensus of the faculty,
the students, and the admin»
istrators on the task force. It's
pretty much agreed upon there,
However, I'm not sure that we‘ll
have to wait for Gaylord money
to come in before we can see Lhis

trustees from the task force are
going to propose to the board of
trustees later this month. in the
meeting where they set the col-
lege budget for next year, a

long period of time, improve the
size of the collection and the
quality of the collection.

students?

Simon Levin

First of all, this 590 was an
arbitrary figure that someone
worked out, I'm not sure who.
Realistically. I don‘t think it
would be that much of an
increase. I have several reasons
for that. One, the administration
and faculty would also use this
doctor's services, or would be
privy to these doctor services, so
it would be their obligation also
to foot the bill. Secondly,
transportation that the health

,think that each of these changes
has been very successful this
year. The films and conceru
have been selected in a much
more democratic way than has
been done in the past, and we
have been able to bring more
films and concerts to campus
because Steve Bialck, who is that
administrative support, and Dave
Steinman, the social coordinator,
have been able to bring in films
and concerts at a reduced rate.
Those are the changes we made,
and those are the changes that
were approved by loint Board. I
think they‘ve been very
successful. The separate criti-
cism that this year the films
committee has placed to much of
an emphasis on “popular” films

center now provides would be
almost eliminated, except for
people being rushed to the
hospital. So money would be
saved on transportation to and
from the health clinic, which is a
quite a bit of the health center's
budget.

Also, we would save money
on the drugs that we now buy.
Currently we buy the drugs
individually packaged and this is
because we do not have a doctor
there. Legally we are required to
buy mass-quantity drugs
individually packaged. This has
considerably upped the health
center's budget. It hasn‘t upped
the students‘ health center fee as

rather than on more “culturally
enriching” films is a valid
argument. However, personally,
not speaking as an SGA official,
I am very pleased with the
selections the films committee
has made, particularly because
there are more culturally
enriching films being scheduled
on Wednesday nights. That is
just me speaking as a student.
As an SGA official who, in a
sense, oversees the films chair, I
think it would be an even greater
injustice if I or Greg were to
interfere with either Scott
Bernberg’s or the films
committee’s decisions. Maybe
it‘s a valid argument that the
films committee is placing the
wrong emphasis on th ilms it

this new finerztrts building,
because currently. fine arts at
Grinnell are lacking. We as a
College have lost a lot of quality
students just because of their
frustration with the lack of at
tention their particular discipline
is getting. This includes people
who are involved in dance, studio
art, theater. . , .We are a liberal-
arLs college and these disciplines,
whether you are going to major
in them or not, should be
improved.

Also, I am currently
supporting an initiative to get a
doctor on campus. This I feel is
an important issue and I'd funnel
some money into that. Right
now the initiative proposes that
the student health fee will in-
crease to cover the docior's salary.
By the time you're reading this,
the campus will have been
swarmed by reasons why I
support this initiative.
Personally, my feeling is that a
doctor would be a very valuable
addition to the Grinnell
community. The doctor would
serve students as well as faculty
and administration. A doctor
would prevent the excess cost we
are now paying any time we want
health care other than non-
prescription drugs or minor burn
treatment, which is basically all
thatthe health center provides.

I'd like to see quite a bit of
Grinnell's facilities improved,
specifically the fine-arts center
and with the doctor. That still
leaves a lot of leeway with the
money.

student body would feel even
more outraged if I were to
somehow try to interfere with
any of the selections they were
making. It's not my place, it‘s
not my job, and they are better

add to my response is simply that
Scott Bernberg, the films chair,
has always been very open to
constructive criticism and
suggestions. Films Committee
meetings are open to the public,
and I would challenge the people
who make these criticisms of
Scott and the films committee to
actually contact them, make
suggestions and offer input,
because it won‘t be ignored.
