The eifort to raise funds on campus is
being organized by the students of

take place tonight. The organizers are
asking students to sign up not to eat din-

each person who abstains an amount
somewhere around $1.25 will he
donated to COSES by FOG

At the time the 5&3 went to press, the
students from Spanish House had suc-
ceeded in Signing up approximately 700
of Grinnell's 1,050 students on board.
Because oi the success of the fast, Quad
Dining Hall will be closed tor dinner
and all students who are not pare
ticipating in the last will have to eat
dinner in Cowles,

In conjunction with the FOG Past the
students have also arranged with many
local restaurants in town to get a donar
tion on a “per meal basis" for each
meal that they serve in their
restaurants on Friday night. JD's
Restaurant will be paying the group 25
cents per meal and Pagliais will also be
donating 25 cents [or each pizza they
sell. The Longhorn will also be givrng a
donation to the group Ann Kosek. a
resident 0! Spanish House, explained
that they would make available to
students a complete list at all local
restaurants participating in their eiiort
to raise money.

Kosek explained that all money rais~
eii irom the iast and sent to COSES for
distribution will be used strictly for
iood and medicine for the refugees.
Emphasizing that they were using the
money solely for humanitarian pur
poses, Kosek responded to questions
about the ties COSES has with the
"Democratic Revolutionary Front."
the revolutionaries fighting the govern
iiient iorces ot El Salvador

Kosck explained that cosas does
have ties with the revolutionaries but
that "we can earmark any and all
money" thatis sent to COSES "We can

l

guarantee that money will go for iood
and medicine and nothing else," Kosek
said.

In its larger etiorts to get support [or
an end to involvement in El Salvador.
the group has also been circulating the
iollowing petition to be sent to Iowa
Senator Chuck Grassley and Secretary
oi State Alexander Haig,

"We the undersigned urge you to 0p7
pose sending military aid to the
military junta governing El Salvador
Reports from numerous human rights
church and news gathering organiza-
tions have convinced us that the
Salvadoran military is responsible tor
the murders and terrorism occurring in
El Salvador. The United States should
cease aiding and abetting such
regimes."

Again responding to questions as to
exactly what COSES was emphasizing
by circulating this petition, Kosek said,
"The government tin El Salvador) is
wrong because it's not representing its
own people, The El Savadoran people
should have the right to choose their
own government without loreign in-
tervention.

"We're not backing the rebels." she
stressed "We're telling the Us.
government not to support the govern-
ment in El Salvador. The main thrust,
though, is to support the refugees who
are caught in the middle."

in addition to sponsoring the last the
local group has put books about El
Salvador on reserve in Burling Library.
The books have been reserved under
the name oi the Poweshlek County
