Propaganda: A night in the Pub

In response to the many inquires I
have received trom my animal triends
(squirrels, dogs, and small rodents), l
have decided to createa typical night at
the PUB (or the reader (and my little
friendsl. it often begins with a casual
suggestion-

- ey, you wanna go the Pub""

- 'm not linislied studying yet '

"Screw studying You're young,‘

"0 K.‘

We descend the stairs (the Curse oi
many a drunken student trying to go
home) and iind a brown and dingy hall,
teaturing a wall with several large
holes Going lurther, we meet a smiling
person known as a Pub door carder.
He/she lwith shitty eyes» asks us tor
our membership 7 although
sometimes lie/she doesn't ask us for
our membership, We can enter, We do.

"Man, it‘s really crowded tonight.
What's going on?"

"Nothing That's why it‘s croivded.‘

“Get a pitcher. I'll get us a table "

"Sure,"

I talk to the bartender He/She talks
back, brings me some beer, promises to
come up to my room sometime and pan
ty. and I go to look for my partner 1 see
him, near the jukebox, already leaning
against the wall and gazing around

“All right. excellent. two mugs
no ' Great " ‘

‘ DO you think it'll be loud? 1 mean,
next to the jukebox and the pinball
machine“ I can hear drunken screamr
ing and the incessant drone of 'Miss
You' as the pinball treaks rev up

"No, no, it's cool. won‘t matter after
a tow pitchers anyway,"

And we drink 1 point out the bar ticks
to my iriend, and or course, the avid
sports spectators gaping at the ’l‘ V, We
soon have silty empty gazes. My come
patriot points out the iascinating red
and white pattern of the tablecloths We
plot massive theit 7 tablecloths, mugs,
pitchers, the jukebox I can't iigure out
how we'll do it.

"Listen, man, it'll be easy —- all you
have to do is act cool 7 wear a big coat
I'll distract them."

"How? By dying?"

"No, just, like I'll start a big discus
sion about the draft or the Astros or
something like that and everyone‘ll be
so enthralled that they won't even
notice you when you take off.”

”They won't notice a Jukebox”

"I don't think you're drunk yet 7 I'll
go get another pitcher."

I watch him fade into the crowd. Sud»
denly a voice shoots into my brain.

"Hey, how's it going‘,y Haven‘t seen

nearer.

“Hey, Jeff, what did you think of Fri-
day’s class? Pretty boring, huh?"

“Yeah, seemed that way. He
preaches too much 7 and the class just

"Yeah, and then we could hold the
class for ransom. Put them in boxes
and use them for sandbags when we in-
vade the bookstore."
