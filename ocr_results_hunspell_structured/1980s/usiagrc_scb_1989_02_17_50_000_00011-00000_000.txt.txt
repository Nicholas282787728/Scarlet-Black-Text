“The Zirkle Jerks" should show
that cleventess doesn‘t translate
to wins. Meanwhile. “The Ice-
Bound Whales," judging by their
1028 less on Sunday. could use
a worldwide reliefeffort.

The Daddy Division, named
for the, uh, incomplete version of
Phil Kantzler's alias, is led by
“Air Noah." This team has a
pretty impressive collection of
athletes (in the Grinncll sense of
the word). but enough of them to
field a football team, Look for
possible dissension on the ark.
“Totally Impossible To Stop"
already disproved its acronym
over the weekend, but will still
mount a challenge for the
division crown.

The faculty-staff team is
coming off of a swson in which
they reached the semifinals, but
they broke some hearts when
they failed to show up for their
first game (maybe it's the 3-2
workload). “Thc Flying Disco
Explosion" is back for another
Fleeting run at mediocrity, while
"7" will finish last in the
creativity competition if not their
own division. “Cereberus
Puppies" should reinforce the
theory that any team with an in-
tellectual'nztme has no place in SI
basketball.

Perhaps the weakest of the
divisions is the one named for
Chris “The Snake" Jacobson
(pretty tough to have that kind of
a rap in your freshman year).
The "Excreted Goodies" did just
that to the Whales in the
aforementioned massacre.
“MBA" is composed of most of
last season‘s championship
”AIDS” team, but may find
themselves looking forward to
grad school after losing some key
seniors

The current edition of “The
Kegbusters" is, in the words of
the Czar, "not that bad." ”Kids
Falling Off Ladders (Just Add
Water)” figure to fall off their
basketball shoes from time to
time. If “The Maulers" maul
anything, it’s likely to be the
perception of how the game is to
be played, and “OS Fudidoes"
have, if nothing else, a name that
defies levity.

defeated the Pioneers earlier in the
season. The Pioneers were able
to handle the many fullrcourt
pressing defenses employed by
Knox which proved so deadly in
the first meeting between the two
teatns.

After breaking the pressure.
tlte Pioneers immediately
established and stuck to their
defensive guns. Getting tlte ball
inside was key because it opened
up the perimeter for Wood, who
finished the half with 8 points.
At the intermission the Pioneers
trailed 31-27.

Both teams played intense
defense to open the second half.
VanSickic asserted herself as an
offensive force with a couple of
unbelievable “pro moves" in the
paint. The latter pulled the
Pioneers within one, at 40-39.
Knox went on a run of their own,
and extended their lead to 10 late
in the half.

Remember that word
“persistence”? The Pioneers
relaced their shoes and scraped
their way back to force overtime
with clutch shooting, great
defensive rebounding by Ashley,
and poor free throw shooting by
Knox (they hit only 38% for the
game).

Jumping out to an eight point
lead, it looked as if Grinnell
would roun away with the extra
stanla But no sooner Knox was
able to force a turnover and
connect on a three-pointer. And
by the time you could say Akeem
Olajuwon correctly, we had a
three point game with 14 ticks of
the clock remaining. >

Wood hit the first free throw
of a one-androne situation to ice
the game for the Pioneers.
VanSickle finished with a game
high 29 points, along with 9
rebounds. Ashley contributed a

The Pioneers will try to close
their season this week on the
winning end with road games on

Swimmers kick past opponents
to capture state championship

The Grinnell women‘s swim
learn rolled over the competition
at last weekend’s state meet,
beating the secondrplace team by
over 60 points. The Pioneers
racked up 135.5 points and were
followed by host Coe, Luther,
Cornell, Lotus, and Euena Vista.

The Pioneers captured eight
first-place finishes, led by Katy
Furnish’s three individual
victories. Furnish swept the
sprint freestyle events, the 50,
and the 100, as well as the 100

and 1000 freestyle and set

Coach Sheila Cain was
excited about the results of the
meet, but is now turning her
attention towards conference
This weekend the women host
the Buddha Invitational in ajoint
meet with the men's team. Cain
predicts a laid-back affair because
with only a week until confer
ence, everyone will be limited in
the number of events they will
enter.

In addition, due to the
upcoming conference meet, some
of the other schools won't be
sending their women’s team to
the Buddha meet, However, Cain
feels that the Buddha meet will be
important for the women “to get
the kinks out of their events
before conference." It is also the
last meet for members of the
team who won’t be making the

conference trip. The Buddha
Invitational will begin Saturday
at 10 am. at the PEC.
