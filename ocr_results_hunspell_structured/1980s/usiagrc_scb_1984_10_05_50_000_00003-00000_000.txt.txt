Strangers on A Train

by Kate \iiii-stei-

Strangers on a .tin tWarnei'. 195] l. the sixth in the Alfred Hitchcock
series. is a suspensiul murder story which examines ieelings oi ex~
changed guilt.

The film revolves around two men. Bruno and Guy. who meet on a
train and agree to each murder somebody.

Bruno iRobert Walkcrt is a psychopathic playboy. and Guy ii-‘arley
Granger) is a young tennis player/aspriing politician.

Guy wishes to kill his wile. Miriam lLaura Elliott, so he can marry a
senator's daughter The daughter. Ann (Ruth Roamnl. viants to
organize Guy's political career. a task Miraim cannot accomplish.
Bruno commits the iirst murder and suiiers the psychological conse-
quensces 7 including a near replication oi the crime.

The trim was enjoyable ior Hitchcock ior several reasons. The subiect
nralter oi guilt's eiiect on a person and the presence oi good an evil side
by side in people challanged the director. And Hitchcock liked to experts
ment with diilerent filming techniques which resulted in fascinating
scenes such as a murder seen through a pair of shattered glasses in
Strangers on a Train.

An added joy ior Hitchcock was iiorking with his daughter Pal. Pat

, played Barbara Morton. the senator's other daughter. who serves as a

sonstant reminder to Bruno oi the murder he committed.
Stranger-s on a r ' i has a iar-ietched storyline out the technique oi
never resolving any tension hides the weakness in the plot. ’lhe tilm is a
good suspenseiul chiller indicative oi the later style oi Hitchcock
