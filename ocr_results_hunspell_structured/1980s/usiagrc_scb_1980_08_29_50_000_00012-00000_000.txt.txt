Joel shatters

tmag e by Soma Peder

Singeresongwriter Billy Joel may be
trying to give us a message in the title
of his latest album, Glass Houses. He
seems to be informing us that perhaps
we have a ialse image of him as a
musician which he is about to shatterr

And indeed Glass Houses does
present a style far different than the
Billy Joel we Came to know through
such songs as “Plano Man," "Just the
Way You Are” and “She's Always a
Woman," Missing is the soft. lilting
tenor voice set against a rich
background oi talented piano playing
we came to expect. The gentle romantic
picture we have of him no longer fits.

So what does Joel give us on Glass
Houses? Mainly, a collection of fast
paced and relatively raucous songs. "I
know it's awful hard to make love long
distance, but I really needed
stimulation, though it was only my
imagination," sings Joel in "It's Just a
Fantasy," a song with a self~
explanatory title. Another similar song,
“Sleeping With the Television 0n," also
gives us a tougher image of Billy Joel,

Two of the most played songs from
the album, “You May Be Right” and
“Close to the Borderline," are also in
his new hardeguy image. But what sets

iirst masterpiece, is the story oi the
Trump’s liie iii the streets oi the City.
There he meets u dog in a similar situa-
Lion and sets all in search at iuod tor the
two of them. Shoulder 1 ms IS a classic
war comedy in which Charlie captures
the Kaiser Singlerhandedly. In The
Pilgrim, Charlie plays an escaped coir
Vlct mistaken for a clergyman in a
small Texas town. It is a parody oi
small town lite and churchgoing. These
films are remarkable for their realism,
both in comparison to dramatic iilms 01'
that era, and to Chaplin's later. teaturer
length mm, which are generally more
romantlmzed,

off this “new sty e is not so much the
lyrics, (certainly no one would Call
"She‘s Always a Woman" a sweet
song), as the almost yelling voice he
uses to deliver them and the lack of a
strong piano part, the instrument on
which Joel excels.

Not that there aren‘t bright spots on
the album. however, in “All For
Leyna," his harsher voice adds depth to
lyrics such as, “50 I wait in the dark
listening for her instead of my old man
sayin’ stop kidding yourself. wasting
your time," and the piano plays an
important part in this song about
getting used and still wanting the
person.

In another impressive piece, “C’etait
Toi,” tyou were the one). Joel. like The
Beatles in ”Michelle" and Dan
Fogelberg in “Dancing Shoes” iroin his
Netherlands album, combines French
and English in a tapestry with soft
background music for a simply
beautiful love song. ”But after all i
know there is no one that can save me,
save me from myself, you were the only
one.” he mourns; later he repeats this
in French

My favorite piece on the album was
the, last. Titled “Through the Long
Night," it is a piece which uses complex
vocal harmonies and sets off the chorus
with a sophisticated change of tempo. It
lSﬂlSD of a slower, softer nature than
many of the songs on the album,
reminiscent of his earlier “Vienna.H
And, like the earlier songs I liked, it is a
love song; this time one of come
mitment, “The warm tears, the bad
dreams, the soft trembling shoulders,
the old fears, but I'm here through the
long night with you," he promises.

All in all, Glass Houses is not an
album one can summarize. Though
most of it is in a rougher style than the
Billy Joel we know, there are still
glimpses oi the old as well. Anyway. to
use the artist’s own words, "Next
phase, new wave. dance Craze.
anyways. it’s still rock and roll to me"
