for change in
Dentel’s role

by Sasha Aslanian and Dave Jones

on April 15. the cabinet oi the Student
Government Association sent a letter to
president George Drake and student ace
tlvilies director Georgia Dentel proposing
:1 revision in Denlel's duties

Citing Dentel's \iork habits as
"unusual." which make it “extremely dil-
liCull for Olhers [o \tork with her," the let
tcr suggested that Daniel's duties be

Dentel. "Technically. l'm, the advisoi-ito
the trim and concerts committees .

with as inucii information as 1 can lrom
market research and then provide them

Ali EISall’ar, SGA president. thinks that
the way Dentel does her job presents pro-
blcnis tor the students, "I think in some
ways Georgia surt oi sees t s program as

it with SGA having little to do with it. l

centered around Dentcls absence trom
campus, Onept the stipulations other con-
tract is that she not be required to hold ot-
tice hours. Subsequently, all business with
her must be conducted over the phone
This. according to the cabinet. creates
uncertainty when trying to reach Dentel as
well as contusion over activities and
budgets. Also. they feel that this leaves her
inaccessible to any student input. and “a
potential tor a better entertainment pro.
gram at Grinnell is being missed. with con
sequent adverse eIieclS on student social
tile."

certs programs." he said.

Althea Kicketts. last year's concerts
chairperson. feels that the responsibility of
receivrng student input should be with the
concerts chair. "Georgia's job doesn't re-
quire her to have ollice hours since they
cut her job in halt. My perception is that
she does the same \mrk but doesn't have
the otllce hours. but ldon't think she needs
them Students are supposed to talk \vlth
the concert Chairperson."

ElSal'tar admits that there is more to the
problem than just Dentel's position. “Part
ot the problem is that traditionally. iilms
and concerts chairs have been extraor-
dinarily independent. And maybe it is. in
part. our fault for not forcing them to get a
committee going." he said

Alter meeting with the SGA cabinet and
the present concert and film chairs, Drake
is waiting until tinols week to announce a
decision on the mailer.
