KDIC explores broadcasting in stereo

While they are not planning to send
the "Noncommercial alternative
sound as far out into the cornfields as
Des Moines, there are some people at
KDIC who hope to eventually light up
that little stereo light on your FM dial.

Despite some oi the discussion on
campus, the stall oi KDIC, Grinnell
College‘s studentrrun radio station,
does not want to Increase the Station‘s
wattage. However, they would like to go
irom their current monoral capacity to
a stereo sound

Station Manager Dave Buck said the
stall is beginning to look into the
possibility or acquiring stereo equip
merit, The cost of changing to stereo
broadcast would be about 53,000 and
with a budget of $6,300 for the station
and the current state of the Student
Government Association budget, there
is no way that the school could shoulder
the cost. Buck said they are hoping they
can iind an electronics company willing
to donate KDlC as a tax write-oil, He
lelt there are "a couple avenues
available" as tar as acquiring the
equipment goes and added. "We would
be much happier with a stereo
transmitter,"

To make the change the station would
need to acquire new cart decks, a new
mixing board, new turntable stylus, a
nevi production board and possibly a
new transmitter. Even with all this new
equipment the board will still be
relatively simple lor DJ s to work. Ac-
cording to Buck, the only diiierence is
that there will be two V.U.'meters, In-
stead of one, to look at.

Rumors still circulating from a iew
years back about increasing the sta~
tion's wattage tor poweri are untrue,
according to Buck. KDIC is currently
licensed by the Federal Communicar

tions Commission' to broadcast at a
power of 10 Watts which is standard for
a HOH'COmmerCIal educational station
and it does allow the station a very
large listening area. "It's not really
desirable for us to go over 10 watts
since we really wouldn't reach that
many more listeners," Buck claimed,
In addition iorwatt stations enjoy
somewhat or a hands-off" policy with
the FCC and more watts would mean
"greater FCC hassles’ and the staft
would have to be "more careful with
operations and logs," The station cur
rently maintains a program log but
with more watts there would be more
regulations,

As far as the current style of the sta-
tion is concerned, Buck stressed that he
is "not after professionalism" in the
sense of making KDic a competitor to
the Top 40 commercial stations. He sees
the station as a "form or exploration”
and likes the specialized programming.
There are complaints on campus that
there is a glut of rock/new nave DJ 5
and while Buck admitted there is a solid
base of rock and new wave, he noted an
increase in classical shows and a
general diversity in the scrcalled "new
wave shows." "If there's a lot of net»
wave, it's what we‘re oilered . , we
don't dictate what our DJ 5 should
play. ‘ A senior disc jockey who had a
show two years ago noted that there us~
ed lo be a lot of jazz shows.

A total oi 120 people applied ior shows
this semester and those that were lucky
enough to getone orihe 56 time slots are
a representative sample or campus
tastes, according to Buck. One of his
fantasies for the future at KDlC is to
create another station using the old
monoral equipment it and when the sta

tion goes stereo, This would be possible
using a carrier current that students
could gain access to by plugging their
radio into a yack in the dorm "It's ob-
viously shooting for the stars.‘ Buck
quickly added but he felt there's "such
a plethora oi individuals who want to
partiCipate” that a second station
would allow this.

Among the crop oi new KDIC
leatures this year, "Sunday at Three"

, is a one-half hour interiiiew program

hosted by Program Director Harriett
Chasms, As a public service Show, Buck
said it "hits home" focusing on issues of
campus interest like racial relations.

that some students may be iamiliar

The KDIC playlist which is passed out
monthly in the post oiiice is designed to
show students what type oi music KDtC
is playing most oiten. The February
playlist showed Bruce Springsteen with
the two most played albums, an inn
ieresting fact for a station accused of
playing predominantly new wave,

One ol the problems that the station
now faces is being cut off of the lists of
record companies that send out free
promotional copies to stations across
the county. Due to the energy shortage
and subsequent increases in the cost ol
producing a record, many record come
panies are forcing small stations like
KDIC to start buying albums and thus
cutting down on the amount or new
music which the station plays. The past
eight months, according to Buck, have
been "pretty tight “
