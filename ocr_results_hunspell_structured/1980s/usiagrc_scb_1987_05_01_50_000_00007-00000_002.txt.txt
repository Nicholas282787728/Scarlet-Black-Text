insidertrading expert Ivan Boesky to take
Reid's position, According to president
Drake, ”Boesky is a great addition to the
college iaculty; he will add a kind oi “real
world' ilavor that this iaculty needs. It's
time to get rid of the Whiners and start brr
inging in people who will make us the big
bucks Without question, Boesky is our
man,”

Professor of classics Gerald Lalonde has
not been seen since last Tuesday when he
walked out oi his Roman lyric poetry
class. muttering something like, ”gonna
put my old lady on the back oi my Harley
and we’re gonna take the scenic route to
California." Lalonde reportedly always
has had “a great admiration tor and a
queer preoccupation with large motor-
cycles and the sort oi people who ride
them," according to Ed Phillips. chairman
oi the classics department, He's seen
'Easy Rider’ 27 times.”

Students of Lalonde have commented
that “now some of the strange things he's
been doing lately sort of make sense. He
occasionally would show up to class in mlrr
rorcd birfocals " Leather wristbands With
metal spikes and necklaces oi chains also
are reported to have been among his daily
attire. The Harley. or "big hog," as
Lalonde also called it. IS apparently a new
purchase, as was the blackrleather jacket
he was seen wearing around campus in the
days preceding his departure.

Several of Lalonde’s colleagues report
that he was very proud or these items,
showing them oii at every opportunity and
referring to them as “cool as hell ”
