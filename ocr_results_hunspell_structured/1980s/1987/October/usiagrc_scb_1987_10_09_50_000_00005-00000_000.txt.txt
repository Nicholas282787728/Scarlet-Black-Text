Student tells of California earthquake

“I had never been so frightened in my entire life ”

by Beth Dahi

when I left on Wednesday,
September 30th tor a iour-day can»
Ierence in Pasadena, I had only
palm trees, California sun, and
warm tropical nights on my mind
Well, actually, my purpose in
Caliiornia was to play my part as a
voting representative in an inter
national organization which pro-
vides humanitarian aid to ioreign
peoples. I had no inkling whats
soever that the next iour days
would be dominated by EARTH»
QUAKES when I got my key and
went up to my room on the 10th
Ilobr of a 12»story hotel

The morning or October lst. I'd
gotten up early in order to make it
to my orientation meeting. I'd just
finished brushing my teeth when
the entire building gave a huge
shudder and the bathroom tiles
began buckling and moving
beneath my Ieet In my contusion,
I thought that something was
drastically wrong with the plumb-
ing, so l leapt out oi the bathroom.
However. the rest oi my room was
rolling and pitching as well. I
stumbled over to my window in
order to look outside. and I saw the
ninerstory building across the
street movmg Irom side to side,
several ieet each way

Panicking, I ran to my door to let
mysell out but something was
obstructing the lock I stumbled
back to the middle oi the room as
the earthquake rumbled away and
then stopped altogether My body
began to shake uncontrollably. and
I weakly sat down on the edge of
my bed. I'd never been so frightens
L‘d In my entire life. After several
deep breaths. I cautiously walked
over to the window and surveyed
the scene outside tor damage. Fine
ding none, I returned to the door
and attempted to get myselt out of
the room, Unioitunatcly. the door
was solidly blocked. so I sat doun
to watch the Tv tor any news on
the earthquake as well as any Inc
lormation on what best to do in the
current situation

The local NBC at'iiliate inter-
rupted the "Todav Show" a tow
seconds aiter I had turned on the
TV, Breathing heavily, a {lustered
anchorman began his report by
stating “As you well know.
southern Caliiornia has just sus»
tamed a mayor earthquake as oi
7:42 A.M.. approkimatcly 30
Seconds In duration " He then went
on to speculate that ”this could be
the BIG one talks. We just don't
know as of yet."

Chills ran down my spine as I
recalled all oi my relatives and
close iriends who currently live
near the San Andreas Fault I also
thought with horror about my
famin: I had to contact them

By this time, I had realized that l
was going to be just line, and so I
called down to the trout desk ior
help with my door. Aiter all else
had tailed. a hotel worker had to

quickly to let them know that I was
alive and well. Before I could Cons

tinue with my morbid thoughts, a
strong aftershock began rolling
through To my amazement. the
anchorman promptly dived
underneath his desk and advised
the Viewing audience to do the
same. So, I ran to a little table in
the corner oi my room and
cowered underneath it ior roughly
15 seconds. Soon, the aililiate's
weatherman came on the scene to
provide commentary on the iault's
probable movement The anchors
man and the weatherman both
agreed that they had ncvcr iclt
such an earthquake. and they were
both California natives But, in the
middle 0! their discussion. another
strong aftershock began, so both
the newscaster and the weather
man hid underneath their desk in
[rent of the cameras. The anchors
man ordered the Camei‘anien to
take cover as well, so a scene was
shown live oi people running all
over the place. Even during the
altershock, I thought this looked so
ridiculous that I started to laugh
hysterically. A clip oi this
emergency broadcast was shown
on David Letterman later that

By rhis time. I had rmljzed that I was
going io he'ﬂne. and so I railed down
to the trout disk ior help wit my
door. Atter all else had

pry my door open with a Crowbar,

Apparently. the earthquake had
shiited the door Irame. thereby
causing the lock to hold last, I'd
calmed down suiiiciently by this
time to leave the hotel ior my lirst
meeting. which was being held in a
hotel a block away Noticeablc

buildings not constructed to be
earthquakerproof as my hotel had
been A Masonic temple that was

tained minor damage to its Grecor

to whether the building was still
saic. Having been assured that the
hotel was still sound, I entered into
the meeting hall (or breakiast and
began to exchange quake stories
with everyone else.

We all decided to watch the late
night news broadcasts to learn as
much as possible about what
damage had been done. The earth-
quake, as it turned out. was not
iroin the San Andreas Fault but
irom the lesser Whittier Narrows
Fault The epicenter of the quake
was a mere seven miles irom
Pasedena. where I was staying,
and only in miles away irom Los
Angeles, In tact. one oithe areas oi
greatest devastation was only
three blocks Irom my hotel, where
a tworstury building collapsed and
crushed three cars Two men barer
ly survived this accident because
they broke the main rule oi surviv-
ing earthquakes by running out in
lo the Street

In all. the earthquake and 19
aitershocks had rolled through
southern Calliornia throughout the
day. By nighttime, I had calmed
down quite nicely The experts
were Iorecasting no more after
shocks iora while. the newscasters
were laughing over the clip where
the anchorman was diving
underneath the desk. and I'd called
my lamily and reassured them
that I was okay,

Even so, I was still getting some

quake the next day. After I‘d
woken up, I nervously noticed that
the once-even plaster oi my ceiling
was marred by the protrusion oi
the iour main beams which sup
ported it, Then. aiter taking a
quick shower in my bathroom, I
discovered that I could not budge
the door in order to get out. Apr
parently. the earthquake had
shiited the door's Irame upwards,
leaving no spare room up at the
top I spent quite some time work
ing on the door, Iirst pushing, then
pulling. then putting on cold water
to shrink it that chancel ), all to no
avail. So, I gave up all dignity and
started to yell ior help underneath
the door while I banged on the
walls with my ice bucket, Finally
someone heard me and got help
irom the iront desk. However, the
workers had to pick through my
dead bolt lock and chain After one
and-onehali hours, the hotel
workers got me out saiely. They
then proceeded to sand down my
bathroom door as i leit. extremely

had to suitor through many Jokes
at my expense: “Beth, you're run-
ning out of good cxcuses tor being

At a A.M on Sunday. October
4th, everyone was iolted awake by
a second earthquake, shaken out oi
sleep. I was too stunned to take any
the ground. Once I approached the
hotel. I noticed that all ol’ the hotel
workers were relusing to re-enter
the building, so I had to inquire as
