Hollywood Shufﬂe

by Paula Briggs

“Hollywood Shuffle” is a Com-
edy which handles a potentially
touchy subject with a periect
balance between sarcasm and
sympathy. Robert Townsend,
director, producer, and co-author.
plays Bobby, a young black actor
living in Hollywood with his family

A Raisin in the Sun

by Caroline Brearley
Pretend you are Calvin, of
Calvin and Hobbes, Jump in your
time machine. Go back to 1951.
JFK is President, the Bay oi Pigs
disaster just came down in Cuba,
and Martin Luther King is big
news. In this environment, “A
Raisin in the Sun,“ a film portrays
ing the struggles oi a black iamily,
is released by Columbia Studios,
Want more? The film's writer was
not only black, but also a woman
The title, “A Raisin in the Sun,”
is a metaphor- about the
vulnerability or dreams. “What
happens to a dream deferred? . . .
does it run, like a stinking sore? . .
or does it wither, likea raisin in the
sun?“ Cramped into a single
apartment. sharing a bathroom

cupants, are Walter Younger

tSidnev Poitier). his mother Lena.
his wile Ruth, his sister Benealha,
and his children, Lena Younger’s
husband has died, and the central
problem of the him is how to spend
the money irom his insurance
policy. The sum is large enough to
enable any single member or the
family to tuliill his dream but too
small to allow all dreams to be
fulﬁlled,

Do not regard this as merely a
period piecc, ior although it deals
specifically with one iamily's
situation in lost. it addresses the
problems we all face trying to
iuliill our dreams. Walter goes
through a period or extreme angst,
almost completely losing his mind,
experiencing great irustration and
contusion in the iace oi a decision
that could change his life. We also

see the struggles or his sister
Beneatha, a medical student who
is currently enchanted with the
idea of breaking out or the coniines
oi her current lite by traveling to
Atrica The possibility of having
their dreams iuliilled is the cruci-
ble ior their emotions.

The [ilm is shot Wllh light
camera angles and achieves a ten-
Slon through violent periorrnances
and concise word choices that most
or us only feel while strapped in a
dentist‘s chair. The screenplay is
lean and aerodynamic; Hansherry
has leit no loose ends. The him is
intensely interesting and is bound
to stimulate your cerebrum even
on the weekend.

La Strada

by Jessica Mezzacappa

”La Strada" (The Road) is an
ltalian film and one oi Fellini's
linest, It tells the tale a somewhat
dullrwilled girl who is sold to a cirr
cus strongman tor 10,000 lire by
her mother, Her older sister had
been sold to the same man and had
died, so she was to be her replace-
ment. The strongman teaches her

to play a couple oi rudimentary
percussion pieces and adds her to
his act to spice up his routine the
breaks chains by expanding his
chestl. He treats her poorly and
drags the poor wail all over the
ltalian countryside in a three-
wheeled house which is dragged by
his motorcycle. Fellini revives the

dying genre oi necrrealism in this
1954 classic just as this sort of film
was beginning, by Americans
anyway, to be seen as silly Euro»
pean nostalgia.

In 1956, “La Strada" received
the Oscar for best foreign film. Fri-
