May 8, 1987

by Brian Strause

Our beloved administration has once
again managed to embarrass itself and the
Grinnell community with their twisted
ideas of Sophistication and class. First,
they attempt to lure a {lock oi new ape
alicants With the infamous logo. Then, we
hear talk of commermals on television on
the pretext that Drake University does it,
so why don’t we? Now, the administration
has simply outdone itseli with the presen-
tation and distribution oi an admissions
iilm seemingly geared to recruit incomper
tent morons with the social consciousness
oi “Seventeen" magazine cover girls, This
effort is so tacky in its essence that I can
not help laughing at the committee who ob-
viously viewed this ten minute film with
enough enthusiasm to actually allow it to
venture beyond the peachy doors of Mears.
The college. in its attempt to be spoken oi
in the same breath as Williams and
Amherst, wailows in the iestermg
academic waters oi community colleges
and vocational schools.
The film gives the impression that the
greatest oi the college's social
achievements lies in the fact that Bruce
Springsteen once played here. Springsteen
takes his place at the beginning of the film
as he serenades us with all the drive and
emotion of a freshman during New Student
Days. His photo is highlighted with a
pastel Esprit background, embellished
With the message. “Bruce Springsteen 7
Grinnell, Iowa." Unfortunately, this film
fails to mention that this historic event Dee
curred a dozen years ago and that ii the
Boss were to grace us With his manliness
now, in this Age of Higher Acoustics. we
could not provide him with an adequate

place to pcriorm.

The propaganda continues to dribble at
the viewer, like vomit dripping oii a toilet
seat into a dirty bowl. Photographs waltz
across the screen depicting the morning
dew caressing beautiiui North Campus
however. this visual stimulus seems
somewhat unfamiliar as i doubt my own
imagination could have possibly concocted
such a slanted vision, even it i had ever
considered strolling across the muddy
iields at 5:30 in the morning.

interviews with townspeople are
reassuring in that they promote the idea
that. students get along with the communlr
ty like corn on a cob. A woman represen-
ting the bakery says, “Everyone will try to
go out oi their way and be iriendly to the
students " A farmer “seven miles from
Grinnell" backs up this assertion when he
says oi students, “It‘s really great to have
them around.” i can just see myseli, a
high school senior stroking my newly ar-
rived SAT scores, feeling relieved that
upon my admission to Grinnell 1 will be
iree oi the tear oi the wrath oi irate
Hawkeyes, bearing pitchiorks and rolling
pins.

The iilm attempts to elevate itself above
other admissions iilms by poking iun at the
common misconception that Grinnell is
“Cornell 7 the ivy League University" or
that iowa and idaho are one and the same.
This scene is in debt to "Romper Room"
ior its enchanting and coioriul special ef-
iects. which explain the root at the
college's name and location with amazing
preciseness and accuracy.

Perhaps what makes the him so appeals
ing to Admissions is its demonstration oi

just how articulate Grinnell students can

be. One woman commented on her impres-
sions of Grinnell when she said, "i was
captivated iwas like wow.” To make sure
you catch this earth-shattering observa-
tion the word "W0 " is [lashed on the
screen in all its iluorescent glory. in the
meantime, t was like gagging myscli with
a spoon, wondering who would shell out
thirty bucks to apply to a school which can
be ultimately expressed only in terms oi
“Wow.”

The tilm slows down to a halt and a
woman irom admissions pops on» the
screen, dashing all hope that the clip is
iinaiiy over and says, "There's a point in
all this P.R. Stut’l where i feel. like I'm a
shiny admissions publication Just speak:
ing, because I'm using words like “unique
and ‘growth .' But its true." She continues
to say, "How can you criticize this whole
hype when actually what you're saying is a
version of all that. But it's not. Or is it?"

For some reason, the mind boggling
abstractness of this final statement does
not seem to tit in With the asinine flow at
ihe clip. The statement actually asks you
to think; so what if it only takes live
seconds to conclude that the essence of
Grinnell is hype. The college strives to
compete in the arena oi the Ivy League by
cosmetically spicing up its image with a
new logo, unnecessary renovation, and
glossy propaganda. However, ultimately it
is the students who sufier irom this in
competence. And it is the students who Will
be iorever plagued by the reputation that
Grinnell's administration tries to ram
down the throats of anyone within shouting
distance. Hopeiully. due to our location in
the corniieids. maybe nobody will hear.

‘Misleading
piece of tripe‘

by Barbara Brown

“Ugh!” This is the typical reaction oi a
Grinnell student who has been confronted
‘ith the existence of the Admissions film.
A Grinnell student responds this way, win
cing perhaps. because he knows that the
iiim ieatures Bruce Springsteen, purpose
iy coniuses Grinnell, iowa with Cornell,
idaho: and ill its entire ten minutes con
tains five slides that show snow Wha
went wrong? How could Grinnell show
such a misleading piece or tripe?
According to Richard Ridgway of Public
Relations, the purpose of the film is “to
give an overview oi the school" and to act
as a "springboard" ior questions irom pro-
spective students.

The film's possibilities extend beyond
recruiting efforts. “Alumni groups are "1*
terestcd in showing it to graduates so they
can getan impression of what's going on at
Grinnell now." said Ridgway. The film
also may be used ior iund~raislng pur-
poses

Should prospective students be con
ironted with the name mixVups that occur
between Grinnell and Cornell. Iowa and
Idaho? Ridgway says that the people at
image Presentations thought the best way
to deal with the name problem was to
"play it ior laughs." They did not try to
give the impression that Grinnell is a
"great metropolitan area " ImagePresen-
lotions felt it was best to deal with pro-
blems straight out and "come oii honest."
said Ridgway.

But what about Bruce Springsteen?
Ridgway was anxious to discuss this
aspect of the film which concerns the man
