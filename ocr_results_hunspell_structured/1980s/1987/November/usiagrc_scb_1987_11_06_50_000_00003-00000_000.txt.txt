Alcohol Awareness Week

SGA Notes

by Daniel Schwarz
Once again, the major order oi
business was the Judicial Council
Bylaws, All submitted a triendly
amendment to Section VIII, Part B
to, allow for charges to result trom
any statement admitting a viola-
\tion submitted in a Judicial Coun
cil hearing. An amendment was
then proposed to require that the
statement not be admissable as
evidence during a subsequent
hearing. This was deleated alter
several minutes or discussion on
Judicial Council’s willingness to
conduct a [air hearing versus a
defendant's right to every delense.
Immediately alter this was done,
Joint Board adjourned and
reconvened to pass the section the
necessary second time, Another
amendment was altered to
disallow any charges being tiled
concerning violations being
studied in a Judicial Council hear
ing based on a statement which ad-
_mitted to the violations. Alter this
amendment was defeated, the secs
tion was approved a second time
and everyone quickly dispersed.
Belore the discussion on the
Judicial Council bylaws, 'Joint
Board did accomplish several
other things. Liz reported that the
ice rink is now a possibility again,
.and the Physical Plant will cons
duct a study to see how much it
could cost. The college is now able
to otter a discount on Radio Shack
computers, and other possibilities
are being studied. The Committee
on Student Lire will hold a survey
concerning outdoor concert noise.
A proposal was made to move
some concerts to South Campus.
but that would cost $16,000 to in-
stall a new power source, Two ms
,itiatives have been proposed. One
would maintain the current class
requirements (. nonel and the
other concerns p rnography. An
open forum will be held at South

itiatives, and the vote will be held

Curriculum initiative

We write this initiative in
response to the recent discussion
regarding changes to the college
curriculum.

We, the students at Grinnell Col-
lege, strongly tavor retention or
the college's current sells
structured curriculum, Grinnell
College is a unique institution
because it places an extraordinary
amount of trust and responsibility
in its students, From life in the»
residence halls to the selection of
courses, rules entorced by the ad-

thereby deter them lrom trying
Courses in those areas. With some
imagination, ways can be round to
educate those students with out
completely watering down the
value of the education. (An exam-
ple would be a General Science
course analogous to the
Humanlties 101 course presently
offered.l

3) Some minimal divisional
distribution requirements, ti e. all
students should take 4'.’ courses in
each division) should be cons
sidered. Such requirements are

met by most students anyway, and
thus would not unduly limit Student
chmces, but at the same time
would eliminate incidences of
Students falling through the
cracks,

We believe that it is possible to
retain the unique character or
Grinnell while taking steps to
assure that all students receive the
benefits of a liberal. well-rounded
education, and encourage the
taculty to discuss changes to the
curriculum with the student View
in mind,

 

ministration are, by design. kept at
a minimum Rather, students are 1
given the responsibility to make
their own decisions, as well as the
obligation to deal with the conse '
quences or their decisions. We
believe that giving responstbllity
to students is a learning ex
perience in itseli. in keeping with
the goals ol an educational ins|itu~
tit)". and that students generally
act more responsibly when treated l
as responsible people. Any change
in this basic stance would change l
the character of the college and
would be highly objectionable i

Whereas we appreciate the pres l
sent college system, we recognize
that no system is pertect, and’that ,
there are areas in which the pre-
sent system could be strengthened.
A particular problem is_ the l
possibility ot graduating from
Grinnell without having had a
single course in one whole division,
a prospect clearly in contradiction y
to the college's goals Although the
incidence ot such narrowness of
transcript is rare. the possibility
needs to be addressed We believe.
however, that steps can be taken so
that the problem of the lew can be
resolved without making the vast
majority at students who do
receive education in line with the
college's goals sutter.

li The advice given students
could be more uniform. Good ad»
vice should encourage students to
take courses in unexplored areas
or study. Students receiving bad
advice, or no advice, may not ex-
plore new areas. and may not
achieve the college‘s goals.

2t There should be more general-
education courses tor nonmajors.
Some introductory courses assume
a level of Skills out. 01' line with the
skill levels or many studanS, and
