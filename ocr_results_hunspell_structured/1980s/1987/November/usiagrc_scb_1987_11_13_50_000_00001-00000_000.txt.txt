f inancial:
burden l

by Jonathan Andreas

This year the college library:
may reduce the number oii
periodicals to which it subscribesi
in 1985/36, the college libraryi

,periodical subscriptions cost;

$148,557] in 1986/87 the cost in-l

l creased 23.3 percent to $153,335.!

This increase is largely due to the:

‘ inilation oi ioreign subscriptions i

American subscriptions have only;
gone up 2.5 percent The ioreign=
subscriptions are more expensive
partly because oi the weakness oil
the dollar compared to manyi
ioreign currencies. The inllation oil
ioreign periodicals is mainly due to :
their practice at charging the
United States a higher rate than
they charge subscribers in their
own country,

Christopher McKee, the
librarian at the college, said that
prestigious publishers have the at-
titude that ”libraries can't aiiord-
to discontinue mainline Journals " i
Libraries generally renew their
subscriptions lor as long as possls ,
ble in order to have a set that spans I
many years,

For 1987/38, the library is spen-
ding sasmoo on books and szidilou
on periodicals The budget is
designed to accommodate a H per-
cent increasc in the cost of
periodicals. The bills have not all i
come in yet. but it the cost oil
periodicals rises more than 14 per 2
cent, some will have to be cut. The l
Library and bookstore Committee
will make the policy that will be use
ed to determine what will be cut,
and there Will be a chance for input
irom the involved departments
beiore anything is cut McKee
said, "Whatever is done will be
done in consultation with the al-Y
