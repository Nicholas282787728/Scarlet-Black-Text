Alum stunned by Corcoran’s
departure

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to the announc-
ed rESlgnation of Professor Marlena Cor-
coran, lam not writing speciiically about
her resignation, but rattler about a pattern
I have observed at Grinnell. This pattern is
the departure of talented Junior Faculty
lrom the college aiter only a iew
semesters. Professor Corcoran’s resigna»
tion is thus a symptom of an institutional
disorder which I Will attempt to diagnose.

I am stunned by Professor Corcoran's
departure from the Grinnell laculty. Iler
departure is a loss to the students, faculty,
and the intellectual creativity and integri»

ty of the college. Why do such daring and.

dynamic Junior Faculty tend to leave
Grinnell'? What forces them to leave?
What consequences does their leaving
have? What does this pattern indicate
about Grinnell‘s attitude toward, difr
ferencc, debate, and the proiession ol
knowledge?

To these questions. l will propose possi
ble answers with the hope of producing in
stilulional change. in my reilections on
these questions. I have iound two principal
causes for the Junior Faculty’s departure.
The first is economic and the second,
social. First, the college does not fund or
even foster the academic pursuits of the
Junior Faculty, I often heard in the hallowr
ed halls of ARH that THE ENDOWMENT
is huge. massive, gargantuan, but then I
would hear that there is no money to span
sor academic development. This situation
reminds me of the biblical parable which
so tormented Milton: the Parable of the
Talents. A simple interpretation would be
that one should literally and metaphorical-
ly invest and multiply one's talents. Grin-
nell, like the parable's fearful slave, has
failed to invest in its talent. comically.
THE ENDOWMENT may be Well endows
ed, but it is not well used, As a result,
talented Junior Faculty leave in search of
funding and an administation more com-
mitted to ACADEMIC PIONEERS,

A second possible cause for the depar-
ture of Junior Faculty is the exclusion of
those whose intellectual positions difier
from the entrenched positions of the
Tenurcd Faculty. This dynamic oi excluv
sion seemingly pervades the entire coir
lege. Perspectives differing from those of
tenured proiessors are not only not en-
couraged, but are actively ridiculed and
denounced. Moreover, the ossiiied
Tenured Faculty take personal offense
when the Junior Faculty argue for their
unorthodox positions. In other words, the
Tenured Faculty abdicate the onus
cogitaitdi. Consequently, the daring and in-
telligent Junior Faculty suiier both in-
tellectual and social censure on the Grin-
nell Campus. This censure must stop it
Grinnell wishes to keep dynamic pro~
fessors. Grinnell must escape from the
shadows oi the tawdry morality oi exclu-
sion and silenc‘lng in which it currently
cowers.

These causes need to be considered and
evaluated. Whether my readers agree with
the analysis or not, they must agree that
the Junior Faculty’s departure harbors
disastrous consequences for Grinnell. I
will enumerate some oi the consequences I
foresee, First, Grinnell should realize that
there is currently an excess oi professors
in the job market. but that there will be a
shortage in the 1990 s Because of this cur-
rent excess, Grinnell is able to treat Junior
Faculty as commodities which may be
bought and sold, bird and fired. greeted
and bid iarewell. However, in the next
decade, Grmnell may not have that luxury
oi picking and choosing irom diiierent Ivy
League applicants, it may have to take
whatever remains oiter more prominent

schools have taken thalr pick. Grinnell
would be left with table Scraps.

Second, having table scraps as pro-
iessors will damage Gl'lnnell's developing
reputation as an academically rigorous in'
stituiion. Grlllnell's ranking among the top
ten Liberal Art Colleges by Us. News and
World Report may be looked upon as a lost
”Golden Era” unless specific action is
taken right now to redress the pattern oi
departure among the Junior Faculty.
Grinnell simply cannot maintain its high
standing while it excludes and silences
contemporary intellectual perspectives li
Grinnell acted intelligently, it would take
advantage of the current excess of pro-
fessors by hiring the best candidates and
then funding and fostering their intellec~
tual pursuits so that they remain at Grille
nell, In this way, Grinnell would not be air
fected by the predicted shortage in the
1990 5 As Milton understood, an individual
or an institution cannot bury talent, but
rather must multiply and foster talent It
seems to me that Grinnell is first killing.
and then burying its talent.

Finally, the departure oi the Junior
Faculty should be analyzed as a symptom
of a dangerous disorder. This disorder is
homogenism: a radical suppression of the
pluralism oi modern society. As l have
contended, many of the Junior Faculty
have left because the college did not ac-
commodate the unorthodox positions on
knowledge, politics, scholarship, and
teaching style. As a result oi their depar-
|ure, Grinnell has created a philosophical
and political homogeny which is disguised
as institutional neutrality or
”community." An institution at higher
learning can either homogenize as Grin»
nell does, or can allow difference and
debate. Strallgley, Grinnell seems to be
frightened by the debate and argumenta-
tion, which arises when different
intellectual-political positions meet, This
(ear contradicts everything that institu-
tions of higher education ought to aspire to
and that Grinnell boasts of. After all, our
school “mascot" is the PIONEER an
original investigator of new territory
and/or knowledge. Maybe. now our
“mascot" ought to be changed to the
Ostrich burying its head in sand. Or, better
yet, maybe the “mascot" should be the
Modern Dairy Farmer standing over her
homogenizer, simply put. Grinnell can live
up to its PIONEER spirit, or continue to
avoid, exclude. silence, and suppress the
academic and social struggles of our time.
Whatever choice those in power make,
they must be aware of the consequences.
Right now, Grinnell is endangering its
reputation because Tenured Faculty are
irightened by the prospect oi doing their
job: practicing and teaching intellectual
argumentation.

In conclusion. I ask that this letter be
given consideration and at least debate.
Actually, that is all I am pleading for:
debate and argumentation i write to
diagnose and treat an institutional
disorder that portends terrible conse‘

quences. Treatment oi this disorder seems '

iairly simple, First. Grinnell must
decrease the professor‘s course loads and
hire more professors so that professors
can research and so that departments can
still oiier a variety oi classes without in»
creasing class size, Second, Grinnell must
invest in its talent, Finally, Grinncll must
accept and celebrate the diiierence.

generated by the proiession oi knowledge.
That acceptance and celebration is the
task of all institutions in our pluralistic

 

society. The choice is clear. tascism or

“Knock it off” Outcry

To the Editor:

As one oi the sponsors ior the recent
Alcohol Awareness Week, the Human
Resource Center and the Gay Resource
Center Advisory Board ieel the need to res-
pond to Todd l-larold Fox's recent editorial
in The Outcry

Alcohol Awareness Week was not a step
ping stone ior the college in hopes oi trying
new “policies to cut down on alcohol con
sumption and abuse," as Mr Fox may
believe The purpose oi the week’s events
was not to get people to stop drinking. The
sole purpose was to allow people to gain an
nnnrcncss oi alcohol. No one was ever told
not to drink. No one was ever told to drink.
Those planning the events, attended by
some six hundred people, tried to give
students new perspectives and alter-
natives to alcohol and alcohol abuse

Perhaps what concerns the Human
Resource Center and Gay Resource Center
Advisory Board the most is Mr, Fox's feels
ing that by having this event. the college is
encouraging people to quit drinking. This
was never the case in any oi the events

Perhaps we should question the adver-
tisement encouraging students to buy
Coors beer, which appears in every issue
oi The Outcry. Is The outcry endorse
ing students to consume alcohol? To quote
a phrase irom Mr Fox himseli, “Knock it

Grinnell College

To the Editor:

Because the English department at
Grinnell College teaches virtually no
literary theory before the senior year iand
then only to a icw English majors), thus
concealing the theoretical presuppositions
already present in its teaching oi the so-
called “baSlcs”; because Professor Cor-
coran - whose eiiorts to integrate literary
theory into the curriculum met with some
(albeit Very little) success ~ is now leave
ing Grinnell; because the iindmgs oi our
report (researched and written second
semester last year) on the teaching of
literary theory at the other nine liberal
arts colleges listed as top ten in us. News
Lllld World Report in November of 1985,
were apparently ignored by some
members of the department. contradicted
by others, and labeled as inconclusive by
others still: I can no longer in good cons-
cience recommend Grlnnell College to any
prospective student interested in majoring
in English at Grinnell.

a luculty which is open to divergent views,

With the learning of theory, students learn
to question the choices oi material made

their Norton and other anthologies. Furs
ther, students learn to question their own
critical value judgments, and to ask ques-
lions such as: Why is poet x considered a

criteria ior judging the quality or literary

literary quality by comparing poems ior
