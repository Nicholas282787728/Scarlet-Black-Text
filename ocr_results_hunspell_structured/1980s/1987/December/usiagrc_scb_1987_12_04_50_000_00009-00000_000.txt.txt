Sam’s Music Scan

Springsteen release just in time for Christmas

by Sam Perlman -

“Tunnel oi Love," Bruce Spr»
ingsteen's newest album, is not the
modern masterpiece die-hard Sprr
ingsteen fans would call it. It is,
however, another collection oi
weil»written songs by one or the
best songwriters in the rock world
today, This album is Bruce's se-
cond oiiering oi his new sound,
with which he debuted in 1935 with
his blockbuster hit, “Born in the
USA." Springsteen has opted to
use a more polished sound, while
he continues to write the strong
lyrics that made him famous the
lirst time. This new combination
delinitely sells records, and it has
made Springsteen one oi the most
popular Husband-roll artists in the
world. Only ii Springsteen‘s lyric~
writing begins to suiier will this
combination turn out ioi- the worst.
However. there is no evidence on

shuiiling and shaking blues tune
called ”Ain't Got You." This is the
only song in which Bruce leaves his
working man's lyrics behind. The
contrast oi the poor-littlerrichrbny
lyrics and the empty blues style is
interesting and humorous,

On all of these songs, Springs»
teen describes the confusion of life
and love in the simplest oi ways. in
the song “Cautious Man,” he sings
about a coniused young man name
ed Billy and his uncertainty about
marriage. He sings that "on his
right hand Billy'd tattooed the
wordlove/and on his leit hand was
the word (ear/and in which hand
he held his late was never clear."
It‘s irightening to think how close
ly those two words can relate.

The love that Springsteen sings
about is not exclusively love bei-
wecn a man and a woman. The

This new combination definitely sells
records, and it has made Springsteen one of
the most popular rock-and—roll

artists in the world.

this album that the Boss will plum-
met to oblivion in the near iuture.

The content oi this album can be
described in one terriiying tour-
letter word: love. it is the most
complex and misunderstood emor
lion oi the human species, Springs»
teen takes us on a musical trip
through the “Tunnel oi Love“ care
nival ride. Just like the carnival
ride, sometimes the trip is
irightening and at other times it is
wonderiul

The album opens with a sparse,

song “Walk Like A Man" is a
wonderiul tribute by a son to his
rather and it represents perhaps
the tenderest moment on the
album. The memories and emo~
tions that the son describes are the
type that are not sung or even talk
ed about oiten enough. ‘

This album is lilled with strong
songs about love at its best and at
its worst. There are songs about
love being conquered, love being
iound tor the iirst time. and love

lost [or the last time, if you are
having questions about love, there
is probably a song on this album
that you could strongly identity
with

This is the second Bruce Springs
teen solo album, much like 1982's
“Nebraska." The members of the
E-Street Band, one of the tightest
musical groups in history, make
only cameo appearances on this
album. This is most deiinitely The
Bruce Springsteen Show, with Sprr
ingsteen playing almost every in-
strument at some time on the
record. Yet, thanks to the produce
tion at Springsteen. Jon Landau,
and Chuck Plotkin, this record
sounds a lot more lull than the
sparse ”Nebraska." This is an
album that demands attention, and
it should not be uscd as
background music

With this new sound of his, Sprr
ingsteen has been able to spread
his message to a tar larger group
oi people, You have to admire an
artist who is able to change his
sound to sell records without losing
sight oi his vision and his message.
If only It could have been like this
for all the others with a message to
spread who got lost in the crowded
underground and never saw the
light oi day.

Fetchin Bones Finger Lickin’ Good

by Eric A. Johnson and
Thomas A. Beverly .

Fetchin Bones’ 1985 release,
“Bad Pumpkin,” established the
“rootspop” sound oi the band.
which consists oi vocalist Hope
Nicholls, guitarists Errol Stewart
and Aaron Pitkin, bassist Danna
Pentes, and drummer Clay
Richardson. That sound is back on
“Galaxy 500," their new release,
but it is a bit more seasoned, Don
Dixon’s typically balanced produc-
tion recalls his earlier work with
REM” an obvious Bones ins
iluence. Fetchin Bones' lyrics
share much oi the mysterious.
iragmented imagery present in
earlier R,E,M., but are mostly
more intelligible and often more
absurd. The driver in “Chicken
Truck" ends up at a chicken
shack- “He had wings/Finger
lickin good!" Nicholls' iiery
vocals completely dominate the
band, ranging from a simple,
heartfelt draw] to a passionate

howl, The songs on “Galaxy 50!)"
are a bit more restrained than
previous releases, but the
songwriting is stronger than ever.
This set is not easy listening, but it
is very satisiying and is an lndica»
tion that this band will be around
for a while.

TOM: Though the songwriting on
“Galaxy 500" is probably stronger,
I liked their previous album better
ior its rougher sound: Dixon has
cleaned up the sound a bit Since the
first album, and though it still
maintains a good, rough ieel, it
ultimately is less powerful.
Nicholis is as brilliant as ever,
though, and even slicker produce
tion could not lessen her strength.
The songs here are all good, though
some better than others. “Jesse
James" is amazing, and “Exit"
and “Sourpuss” are not far behind.
“Sammy" and “Riding Around"

are weaker, but would stand out on
the albums of many other groups. 1
hope that this band continues to put
out albums oi this quality, and i
think they can as long as Hope
Nicholls keeps her voice. In spite of
my prelerence tor the earlier
album. this is one of the best
albums I have heard this year. it
gets an A.

ERIC: It gets a B+ from me, I
really liked the way Nicliulls alter»

.nately separates herselt irom the

band, barking the lyrics like a ban
shee goddess, and completely
wraps herself in the music, singing
in a straightiorward style, The
band's only problem is that it
sometimes is too cliched in the way
it ’“toughens up” its music. as in
the song “Riding Around." My
tavorite song is “Sourpuss,” a
bouncy tune. A good, poweriul
album,
