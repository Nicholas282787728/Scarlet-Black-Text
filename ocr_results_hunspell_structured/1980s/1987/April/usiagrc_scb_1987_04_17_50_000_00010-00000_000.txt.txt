April it. itttii

Deieat- Coe

by Robert Litton

"We lucked out." That is how Coach
John Ptitsch assessed his team's rather
dramatic come~from~behind Victory over
Coe on April 11. which occurred with a
home run in the bottom of the seventh inn-
ing Luck? No. just solid. fundamental
baseball. in Grinncll‘l Yes.

With this conference win the Pioneers
eliminated the ever-sovtsible goose egg
winch had haunted their early start. bring»
ing their record to lez. But more important
than the superlicial statistics was the turn~
around in play. Relieving themselves of
their ephemeral "anxiety complex" 7 as
diagnosed by the coach himself — the
Pioneers settled down and pluyed ettective
ball.

Saturday aflernooii's_ funrtilletl. cone
troycrsial game was indeed a sliigtest. The
Pioneers definitely had all their lumber
ready. pounding out l4 hits against Coe‘s
[up three starters. The meat of the order 7
Ian Liti. Eric Miller. and Randy Seelev —
combined for seven hits Coe's hitters. n-
loi-tunntely, were not asleep either. and
scored ii iii the hit dep' ~tment When all
was said and done. however. pitcher Jim
Wei'dnd had racked up his first Win. with
an impressive ll strikeouts —— but not
before some excitement.

The fun started in the bottom half of the
Piolieei‘s' filth, sparked drag bunt
single by second baseman Marty liuii-
sucker. the Pioneers unleashed an
onslaught ofsiligles. gtvtng the home team
a (775 edge

It looked as though more runs would
follow 7 bases jammed. one down — but
the men in blue mutted a cruclal call at
home. The homerplate umpire ruled batter
interference on Tom Monogue instead of a
balk. and thereby robbed the Pioneers of a
well-deserved run. But no matter; the
good guys would eventually prevail.

Down 6-5 in the last of the seventh. third-
baseman Mike Kulikowski led off with a
single Then came llle heroics. Pinch-
liltting. freshman catcher Mike Mohan got
hold of a fastball and knocked it over the
left field fence. Mohan was a hero and
Grinnell won 7-5. Even Harry Caray would
have liked to call such an ending — a true
Justification to slurp down an ice cold Bud,

This—victory was extra special. as the
Victim was Coe. while acknowledging the
luck factor involved. Pfttsch also noted
that it was a "very good ball game"
because his players were relaxed. “We
weren't intimidated, as with Monmouth.
All we have to do is maintain that level."
Hear that. fellas? MAINTAIN

disappointed because his “reserves —
