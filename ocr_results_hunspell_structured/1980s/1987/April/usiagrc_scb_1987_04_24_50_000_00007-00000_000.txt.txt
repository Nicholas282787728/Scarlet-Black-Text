Student blasts Draus and the thhs
of white Americans

To the Editor:

(Fabrication) AS I drove my [987 turbo
diesel Volvo through the predominantly
white neighborhood oi Bridgeport on
Chicago’s south side, I began to feel but-
terilies iluttering madly in my stomach, i
received stares oi jealous hate and expres
sions that read, “How dare that nigger
drive a brand new foreign Car!" As my
iacc burned, and my legs trembled, I

, chanted silently, "Please don’t let these
very large, very white people sabotage my
car,” and “Where will I be safe,‘again7”

I was scared.

Well, enough of that. This letter, if you
haven't already suspected, is a rebuttal to
Paul Draus' “View from the OutSide"
which appeared in the Scarlet and Black
on April I0. In that article he revealed his
{ears of the poor, segregated, black
neighborhood on the south side oi Chicago.
Mr. Draus also revealed his ignorance of
the “black problem." I conclude, with
black literary evidence, that Mr, Draus 7
like the majority oi white Americans — is
suiilering irom a superiority complex
which translates itself into fear of black
people instead of fear of himself.

White Americans' are born into three
myths: invincibility, pureness, and virilr
ty; and so far, these myths have been
upheld throughout history. America's
military strength, the macho man image
of white male society, and the Virginslike
image accorded white iemales (as opposV
ed to black females) are but a few ex
amples of the institutionalization of these
myths,

These myths are manifest in the
behavior 01 white Americans in that they
habitually deny three important constants
tor realities) oi liie 7 birth, struggle, and
dealh — and replace them with such false

constants as money, power, and safety.
The lack of suffering of many white
Americans is reflected in their inability to
cope with the realities of life. Instead,
those things which are attained by force
are the motivating factors in the liiestyle
oi America. Sadly enough, ireedom disapr
pears when these ialse constants are
mistaken for the true constants in life, The
black experience can attest to that Yet, to
the advantage oi black people, our Suffer»
ing has awarded us with a delinite identity,
and an ability to love (as did Reverend
Martin Luther King when he was con-
fronted with disillusioned hatred), Love is
important when life is so unpredictable.

The John Hancock Building and Sears
Tower, and even Grinnell College relieve
you of your fears because they represent
the three myths. It is not the very large,
very black man who is at the root oi your
{ears 7 it is your fear of suffering, of loss
ing your unjustly acquired wealth. power,
and saiety. Why didn’t you have compas-
sion instead of fear7 Because you do not
address the "black problem” as white
denial oi seltjudgement

It is the responsibility oi white
Americans to accept their past and use it
to transcend limitations of color. These
limitations restrict white people irom ob-
Jcctivcly discriminating, and therefore
result in unjust social, political, and
economic disparities between races Once
this responsibility is accepted and pur-
sued, YOUR “own little world" will not ex
isL It will be OUR own little world, The
sooner this is realized, the better, ior as
James Baldwin noted, “God gave Noah the
rainbow sign, no more water, the fire next
time!" 7 Vaicsta Wiggins. '87

Student speaks out on American

Auto industry

Dear Editor:

In the 2/27 issue of the 56:13 I stated that
in most cases little or no sacrifice is made
in buying a domestic as opposed to a
ioreign product, and that I'd deiend that
statement iollowing expression oi oppoSA
ing views. A week later an opposing view
was voiced by Laurie Dunivant, who im-
plied that domestic cars are “of lesser
quality and/or higher price" than ioreign,
in an attempt to reiute my argument about
reducing the trade deiicit This damaging
View of domestic autos has too long been
held by too many people, and I feel it is
time to set the record straight

To begin With, the reason foreign cars
lI’m thinking Japanese cars in particular
right now) on the average cost less than
domestic ones is that they on the average
are smaller and carry iewer people. it one
compares'a domestic car to an import oi
comparable size and periormance, one
will iind that many imported spassenger
sedans and periormance cars have price
tags similar to, or higher than, those of
their domestic counterparts, (This was
true even before the dollar’s decline in ms
ternational value.l The same goes for gas
mileage. Indeed I'd be hard pressed to
justiiy buying domestic cars it they were
real gas-guzzlers; oil is perhaps our most
expensive import oi all. I must confess at
this point that commuter cars oi 50 mpg
and above are only iound among imports
7 Le Honda CRX HF and Chevrolet
Sprint ER, But as soon zis one starts look
ing at cars which seat four pcople comior7
tably and havc adequate power to carry
them, it’s an even playing iield. And now a
iew words regarding quality.

Domestic cars gained a muchaeservcd
bad reputation in the early 1980's when all
three major domestic manufacturers were

overhauling their entire production
systems to accomodate the public's cravV
ing for smaller cars The trouble, I believe,
Was that many oi the new models were put
in |he showrooms while still in their exs
perimeiital stages; the producers did not
have time to thoroughly test each new
model because they were quickly losing
customers to foreign smallrcai‘ producers.
They wanted the new models out on the
showroom floors, not on some 100,000-mile
endurance and reliability trial run.
Anyway, it has now been five years since
that rocky transition period, and the bad
reputation hasn't gone away. But why not?

is it because 0’ poor ratings in reliability
Surveys? These have kept domestic autos'
reputations at rock bottom ior the past iive
years But the survey conductors do not
state whether geographical distribution is
taken into account. For instance, the huge
majority oi cars in the Midwest is
domestic. Oil the west coast the ratio of im7
ported to domestic cars is close to 50:50.
Now where do cars take more of a
heating? The Midwest has Subzero
temperatures in winter, ice and salt on the
roads, and humid summers. Only sparse
regions of the westcoast have anything ap-
proaching these extremes, Thus the
surveys could be a little biased.

So is it the diiierent labor structure we
have in the U.S.'! The Japanese iactory
system is inherently better in terms of
employee relations and job satisiaction,
and I'm happy to see U,S, companies adopr
ting this system. But it correlates only par-
tially with quality oi iinished product
Look at it this way: Before the late 1970's,
the high quality of U S.»built cars was un.
challenged, They could take abuse, went
like stink and many never saw the inside of
a repair shop except ior routine

I sllould have known this would happen.
It’s during times like this when the name

large portion oi the Grinnell community.
Once again, I have stumbled blindly into a
minefield

a; think I'll have to take that back, in this

3% something I ieel strongly about and I think
gt it's important that I clarify, to some ex»
pgient, what i had in mind when I wrote my
a column two weeks ago.
to First of all, I am not a racist. I don’t
ﬁthink I should have to prove that to
Seanybody. I don't know how i would I'm

Iknow some willsay “You may not think
as, you are a racist, but you can't conceal your
gﬁbourgeois prejudices,” I don't buy that.
sgit’s true, I am white, and I am middle
égclass. But I'm also human.

Ezsomewhat open to interpretation. And Sure

i “" ﬁftﬁh‘emigéﬁm harnesses“:

enough, it was interpreted openly.

Anyway, it's quite apparent that no one
got out oi it what i thought i put into it. i
thought I was saying something about mid-
dle class paranoia, about ieeling helpless
when forced to deal with an alien situation.
about having to live in a world that I didn't
create, haying to deal with a system that
was screwed up years bciore I was born in-
to it. I wasn't saying that the tension which
exists between races today was good, or
right, i wasn't condoning ractsm. and I
certainly wasn’t saying anything about the
“eternal conflict between the good white
man and evil black mail."

The fact that anyone could interpret it in
so ridiculous a manner is a comment
either upon the poor writing oi the article
or the poor comprehension of the reader. I
am forced to assume the former, Oh well.
At least’l tried.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not sorry I did
it. It was something i wanted to write
about, and I wrote aboutit, and a lot of peer
pie got mad. I’ll iace the consequences oi
my actions.

Besides. I don't think that the results of
my writing that column are all that
negative. There are a lot oi things I don‘t
understand, that is obVious. I am trying to
understand them. And right now, Ithink I
understand them a little better than I did
two weeks ago.

If you've bothered to read this far, I
thank you I'll shut up now.

lum calls for help in state of Iowa

,food drive

To the Editor:

Helpil _

The State Employee Food Collection is
an annual benefit \vithin Iowa's state
government to collect donations oi iood for
less fortunate Iowans throughout this
great state. To encourage participation in
the drive, competitions among and within
agencies of state government are aimed.

This year. the Governor, his staff, and
the Department oi Management staii have
collaborated in the competition by iorming
teams based on the colleges we attended. 1
was oiiered the so-called “opportunity" to
join the University oi Iowa team (Law,
1972) or the Drake team (M.B.A,, 1978);
however, because my iirst loyalties are
and shall always remain with Grinnell Col-
[age (What else — B.A., 1969), I insisted on
being on the Grinnell team 7 even if that
meant I would be the only one on the team.
(As in Dante's Inferno, Grinnellians are

pretty scarce here)

maintenance. (I based this statement on
personal experience iroin every prerI980
domestic car my family and iriends have
ever had the pleasure oi owning 7 not on
questionable statistics from some con»
sumer magazine.) Those old cars were
quite primitive by today's standards, but
the quality was built right into them 7
long before the modern Japancse
assembly-line system was even heard of in
the us. My point is<that one need not wait
until this system is completely adopted by
US, companies before one can expect a
good product, i will admit there were a iew
major productrdesign blunders in prerlsaa
domestic cars 7 Pinto landrmines and the
Edsel come to mind. But, as John Kenneth
Galbraith noted in his book The New In»
dustriul State, the tremendous publicity
these fiascos received is in one sense a
tribute to how seldom they occurred.

Then is it personal experience? People
oiten stereotype domestic cars, saying
they recently owned one, it had problems,
and they traded it in on an import. As it all
U.s. companies can be judged on the basis
oi one's product; why do people generalize
in this way? No doubt it has something to
do with the reliability surveys whose value
l have already questioned.

that I need not taste defeat, but, rather,

The food drive begins in full force next
Sunday. April 26, and runs through the
week, but the key day will be Friday, May

final tally will be taken to determine which
team contributed the most nonsperishable
food items. Your contributions by then to

ioreign company that I know oi has match

time and mileage, with the exception oi

Laurie’s criticism oi the argument in my
first letter to the editor 7 about the trade
deficit 7 was based on the belief that to
buy a domestic car is to “subsidize an “'1er
flcient industry that lacks Iin com-_
petitiveness,” I hope this refutation of that
belief has lent new credence to my original
argument. The western nations are on the
brink of a trade \var. Deficits promote
trade wars, which in turn are fought with ’
protectionist measures. Protecttornsm

Quite the contrary 7 the bad reputation oi
domestic products which I intend to dispel
is the real protectionism, against the us.

abroad had this reputation lasted only
those two or three years during which it
was deserved. But the reputation still eat-

of it. 7 Mark Ucbcl
