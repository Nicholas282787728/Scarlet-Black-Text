these words being used to crush

This reaction to a woman‘s
response to an issue that oiiends

Lobaus,

ticel was his alone. We somehow
don't think it necessary to OWN
our actions: So i woke up this mor~
ning with someone i don't know; it
wasn't my iault, l was drunk. 1 try
to divorce the act irom the person
and tail. We iorget that the cons
cience pays its dues with our seli-
respect, and that it isn’t duped by
our rationalizations. ii i kill so-
meone, 1 alone will hear the guilt,

I think that our diiiiculty with
values is evidenced by “repressive
tolerance” on campus 7 our in-
ability to put our tool down about
what we think is right or wrong.

This stems from our inability to
distinguish right and wrong for
ourselves; how can we pass Judge
men! on others‘ actions when we
are unsure oi our own? We further
deieat ourselves by making a
distinction between international
issues and our own morality: it’s
wrong ior multi-nationals to ex»
ploit the inreign Third World, but 1
am not wrong [or treating other
people as means to ends. How can
we allow such broad inconsistenr
C185 to exist within our own value
structures? We {all to see that WE
will determine whether our lives

will be heaven or hell; ii we act in
such a way as to accept our respon
sibility to ourselves and act to at-
tain the sources oi our satisiaction,
we will likely be satisiied. it we
disclaim our moral obligations to
ourselves and allow decisions to be
made ior us, we will likely ieel
betrayed and inetiicacious. l alone
have to live with myscli ior a
liietime; whether or not i decide to
act with my conscience and take
responsibility ior my rate is my
personal decision and responsibilir
ty. it is also the route to developing
values.

apologized.

The library is another locale
known ior its occurrences oi coma
mon diseourtesy. li you’re at this
school then you must have been in
plenty oi libraries during your
adolescence And what's the iirst
rule oi any library? Be quiet,
right? So instead we get these
periodic waves oi people ilowing
into the building who pause just in-
side the door to exchange several
minutes of Cordialities. With the
atria on both sides oi the circula-
tion desk the sound waits cleanly
throughout the iirst and second
iloors and we are all tr ted to a
plethora or unwanted m ality it
you rally want to speak to these
people, the Forum is a mere big

cookies throw away, and it has
been known to play host to a startle
ing number oi study breaks.

it gets really rowdy around ex-
am time. l know that you have ex-
ams coming up and that you're
probably under the iniluence oi
more than a little caiieine. But you
aren’t the only one. There is an at
titude held by too many people
here that goes something like, “I
have more work to do than any perv
son in the history oi higher educa-
tion, These other people look like
they’re studying, but they couldn’t
possibly have as much to do as l,
Thereiore, it is my right and
privilege to annoy them by break-
ing the universal rule oi silence in
the library." i didn't realize that
whispering is a learned skill,

plague oi disrespect is the _
halls. The salad bar is no place t
hold a conversation oi more than 3
seconds or so. it you have tha
much to say to this person, then SI

her. If you’re the one who can’t gal
to the cucumbers or the root bee
because or these two ingrates, .
simple “excuse me” is an etiectiv

ing, “Get the hell out oi my way.‘
No one is oiiended and it work
every time.

Along with eating in Quad come
the irreplaceable pleasure oi bus
ing une‘s tray. it isn’t a task tha.
requires a great deal oi concentra
tion, but maybe the college shoul.
oiier a one-credit class ior thos
who can’t seem to carry it out. You
may have noticed those guys ir
dininghall attire standing there
watching you intently. Are the
there to help you through an,
breaches oi dining~hall protocol?
No, they are waiting [or you to iil
up the tray cart so they can wheel
it back into the kitchen and scra.
the leitovers back into the cookin-
pot.

it is probably a sale bet tha
most oi the people who work in the
dining halls are not doing so
because oi a desire to be part oi the
cutting edge oi culinary e ,
perimentation They are there
because they have to be. and they'
don't want to place the new glass
rack on the pile ior you, or clean up
the remnants oi your iood iight. o.
bus a tray that you leit sitting there
because of the disgusting things
you did with your leitover iood

So it seems that we have a pro?
blem here. Maybe it can be chang-
ed with a smidgen oi eiiort. it
you're going through a door and
there is someone several paces
behind you. give the door an extrtr‘
push ior that person. and
acknowledge the person ii he oi
she does it ior you. It you ask lor
help with the computer and it still
doesn't work ior you, a simple,
”thanks, anyway" Will reward that
person much more nicely than!
“This computer sucks." We can't
all be UCs. Maybe you think you're‘
too shy or too busy to extend such
exasperatingly diiiicult courtesies
to those who would do it ior you.
You aren‘t too shy or too busy, you
just aren't worth the time it takes:
to do it.
