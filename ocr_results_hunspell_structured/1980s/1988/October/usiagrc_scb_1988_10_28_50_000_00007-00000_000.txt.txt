all season. It did not help mat»
ters much having their starting
halfback (Lorimcr) and stopper
(Brad Bisgard) out with injuries.
Despite ending the year on
such a sour note, coach
Pfitsch still had plenty to be
pleased about. "I naturally regret
not winning the conference
championship, but overall we
definitely had a tremendous
season. Like I said before, this
is the best team I've ever coached,
and their record shows it I'm
extremely pleased with how
they played all yeart . r i I'm

especially pleased with the cap-
lains(Bisgard and Scelcy), who
provided leadership and poise
throughout the season"

So that's it. Depressing
that such a fine team had to call
it quits, but grateful for having
the chance to see them play. My
kudos, Pioneers.

scored three touchdowns proved
to be the difference. Grinnell was
led by Jim Weiand, who enjoyed
the best day of his college career
as he passed for 208 yank and ran
for another 70 yards, and Paul
Mantemach who rushed for two
touchdowns.

This week, the Pioneers are
preparing for their final home
game and toughest assignment of
the season as they take on the
league loading Monmouth Fight-
ing Scots (7-0). Saturday at 1:30

Rugby woes
continue

by Mark Pilder

Sunday, Oct. 9, the Grinnell
Griffins strengthened their
reputation as the team to beat in
Iowa rugby. In spite of numer-
ous injuries tlte Griffins managed
to field a full team for the fifth
week in row. A caravan of cars
made the fragrant yct scenic drive
to Baxter to take on Newton and
Skunk River in a rural rugby
festival.

In the first game of the af-
ternoon Grinnell faced Newton,
With the enthusiasm of Trevor
Harris, the leadership of captain
Robert L. Knowles, the Griffins
dominated the majority of the
serum downs and made a good
showing. However the happy-go-
lucky Griffin offense was unable
to move the ball consistently
against a physical Newton de-
fense. On the other side of the
ball. the scrappy Griffin defense,
led by Kirk Marty, was able to
hold Newton to only 24 points

After a short rest Grinnell
took on Skunk Riverr The fa»
tigued Griffins managed to con-
tain a fresh Skunk River [cam to
only 26 points. In the final
minute of lhe game Grinnell took
advantage of a Skunk River mis-
take when Vince scooped up a
loose ball and powered into the
Lryzonc. Mark kicked it througll
the posts for thc extra point.

On Oct. 29, the Griffins play at
home against the University of
Iowa,

Tennis team‘ finishes
year on positive note

by Laura Whitmore

Grinnell's women‘s tennis
capped off the ‘88 season with a
seventh place finish in a field of
eleven teams at the Midwest
Conference Tournament, and a
dual record of 676. This is a
marked improvement over the ‘87
season when Grinnell was 3-9
and finished in lOLh place at con»
ference.

Conference was truly a
team effort for the Pioneers and
every player at conference con
tributed points to the team score.
Heather Radach, seeded second at
number two singles, won her
first two matches to make it to
the championship round, where
she lost to the number one seed.
Erika Smith, at number one, and
Jenny Wang, at number six, both
lost their first matches but came
back to win their consolation
rounds. (Players who lose in the
first round go into a consolation
round and can still earn points for

the team, although each match is

worth one point, as compared to
three points in the regular round.)
EliLabelh Werner, at number five,
and captain Apryl Henry. at
number four, also scored for the
team, defeating their first round
opponents before losing to the
number one seeds.

In doubles. Smith and
Radach, playing at number one,
won the consolation honors, after
being defeated in the first round.
The number two team of Apryl
Henry and Lisa Jcpsen and the
number three team of Jcnny
Wang and Elizabeth Banftcld both
won in the first round before [037
log to tough opponents in round
two.

All in all, the Pioneers en-
joyed a good season and can be
pround of their performance. At
the beginning of the season they
said they could compete with any
team in the conference, and this
past weekend proved it.

Women's soccer ‘
fares well out East ,

A .500 Midwest Confer-
ence record is at stake for the
Grinnell women‘s soccer team as
it hosts Beloil tomorrow at 11
am. The Pioneers are 273 in
their first year of conference play
and are 4-6-1 overall. Last week
Grinnell ventured cast for three
games, coming away with an
even l-l-l mark.

Monday the Pioneers
dropped the opener to Manhat-
tanvillc 20 in a lackluster per
formance. Coach Eskildsen said,
"We did not give our usual hard-
noscd effort. We might have
been tired from the two days of
travel.“

A rcgrouped tcam bounced

back Wednesday for one of their
best outings of the year. The
Pioneers took a 1-0 lead in the
first half on a goal by Jennifer
Hooper off a Jenny Wood comer
kick, chis tied the game with a
few minutes left in regulation.
Grinncll dominated the overtime
period but could not manage a
goal,

Thursday completed the
cycle for Grinnell as they stole a
victory against New England.
Eskildcn‘s squad conlolled the
game, outshooting the opponct
37-3. Sara Conner tallied the
Grinnell goal on a 20-yarder with
an assist from Wood.

Only one policeman was violent,
and only three of the protesters
were arrested for assault. The
three represented the Mayday An»
