A Soldier's Story, a must see

by Matthew C. Macho

A Soldier’s Story is an in-
tensely engrossing murder mys-
tery set in Louisiana, 1944. A
hateful black sergeant has been
murdered at the army base. sup-
posedly by the KKK, or perhaps
by a bigoted white ofﬁcer. Most
people don't see much point in
looking into the incident; but a
Captain Davenport is nonetheless
sent to investigate. Davenport
shocks the base. for he is a
lawyer, and he's black: the only
black ofﬁcer anyone there has
ever seen.

The film is adapted from
Charlie Fuller‘s awardawinning
play "A Soldier's Play". and re-
tains much of its excellent cast
from the Negro Ensemble Com»
pany. Additionally. it stars the
late Adolf Caesar (The Color
Purple) as the loathsome
sergeant, and Howard Rollins
(too often called "a young Sidney
Poitier") in the starring role as
the Captain, Rollins has had a
long break (four years) since his
last ﬁlm, Ragtime, for which he
was nominated for an academy
award. Hollywood producers (the
ones who brought us lr/llar) con-

sider serious ﬁlms starring lesser-
known black actors too risky an
invesunent. Hopefully attitudes
will change as producers get used
to the idea that there are talented
black actors capable of carrying a
serious film. As Captain
Davenport says at the end of this
ﬁlm, "They'll get used to me
They'd better".

Rollins gives a superb per-
formance as the ﬁlm alternates
between tense, combative inves~
tigative interrogation and
provocative ﬂashbacks. skillfully
cut and blended to manipulate
time, space, and emotion as the
puzzle fits together. While the
ﬁlm is a valuable examination of
how racism poisons minds and
destroys lives, it is first and
foremost an excellent murder
drama, so expect heavy duty en-
tenainment along with a dose of
education as to just what was
happening in America forty-odd
years ago. A Soldier’s Story is
not to be missed.

Up in Smoke for the stoned

by Brian Strausc

Any showing of Up irl
Smoke should include a manda-
tory givwway of free joinls, be-
cause only the extremely storied
could ever enjoy this childish
romp through 70s drug culture
Guided by those wacky cult
heroes Cheech and Chong, this
movie rests on the premise that
stoned people will laugh at any-
thing, Taking this theory to the
extreme, Cheech and Chong bar~
rage the audience with a series of
shallow jokes based mainly on
dntgs, occasionally widening the
scope to phallic and bathroom
humor. A "classic" scene occurs
when Chong pulls out a joint the
size ofa large turd. One can only
imagine the fit of laughter that
will overcome a stoned audience
at the sight of such a monster
splccf.

"-ikc, dude if you smoked that
doobic you'd be on the way to the
moon ” But, the humor doesn't
stop here. Chong informs
Cheech,/a self professed mari-
juana connoisseur, that the joint
is a salad of Maui-Wowie and

 

Labrador. Labrador? Well, you
see Chang's dog ale his slash so
he had to follow him around for
three days in order to collect the
remains. "We're smoking dog
shit?!," Cheech inquires. He
speaks a little bit too soon as lhc
buzz quickly sizzles his brain to
mush. Fortunately for Cheech,
his new buddy Chong has just
the drug to neutralize the effect of
the killer joint. Chong hands a
couple of pills to Cheech, who
quickly gobbles them down,
Chong then tells Checch not to
take those pills, take these in-
stead. Get this, Chong has just
taken a handful of acid without
even knowing it. Ha ha. maybe
I'll close Jimmy tomorrow in
homeroom.

Up in Smoke is strictly for
junior high school kids who
smoke cigarettes at the mall and
steal from their older sibling's
slashes.

The Fly, vomit, pus and slime

by Jessica Meuacappa
The Fly is a truly modern
remake in the truly modern sense
of the word. Charles Edward
Poguc has rewritten James
Clavell‘s original screenplay,
turning it into little more than a
grotesque display of Jeff
Goldblum's demiser it all starts
when scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff
Goldblum) meets beautiful
reporter Veronica (Geena Davis)
at a scienccvorienlated cocktail
party or something like that.
He's got a secret. He has
developed a teletransporter-- a
machine enabling him to move
objects from one "pod' to another
by dissembling them atom by
atom and putting them back
logethcr, They fall in love (the
people. not the atoms). She will
write a book about his creation,
but not until he's perfected the
machine for the use of human
beings. They look exactly alike.
All of this is just the
framework for the big event of

...or sucessful black comedy?

by Scott chbcrg

It is best not to think of The
Fly as a remake of the 1958
classic starring Vincent Price.
The 1986 version conjures up a
truly different image than one of
a man in a tuxedo, stuck in a big
fly's head from the Universal
make-up depanrnent. Jeff Gold-
blum stars as a young eccentric
scientist who has been experi-
menting with telcportation.
While Goldblum is busy
teleporting himself across the
room, a ﬂy enters the chamber
and into the physiology of the
man (enough motivation to chip

the movie Brundle gets drunk
one night and decides to transport
himself through the pods, and
succeeds—he thinks Actually he
becomes spliced together with a
ﬂy genetically in the process.
But don‘t worry, I haven't given
anything away. There really is
nothing to give away. For
during the rest of the movie,
Brundlc rots. Director David
Cronenbeerg gets really into the
gore aspect of this ﬁlm- vomit,
pus, and slime are the stars of the
second half of the film, and the
plot survives only long enough
to get in a surprise appearance of
Cronenboerg himself, as a
gynecologist.

I haven’t seen the 1958
original, but somehow l doubt
the 1986 version does it justice.

results are both humorous and
terrifying. The Fly succeeds
quite unexpectedly, as a black
comedy. Geena Davis and Gold-
blum are a sexy couple, before

The Fly provides as good of a
scare as Aliens, while still pro-
viding enough sick humor to
keep most folks laughing.
