Student in China told she's
not a real American

by May-lee Chai

Since coming to China, I
have learned that I am not
REALLY an American. Oh, sure,
I was born in the U.S., have
spoken English all my life and
only came upon Chinese since
college, but I'm not really
Americanr Real Americans, I
now know, are white.

I teamed this pearl of wisdom
after being hired to teach English
A Chinese man appeared on the
Nanjing University campus,
looking for Americans to leach
English. He said he needed
teachers for his school and an-
other schoolr

My friend Leslie Chcng and I
told him we were interested, so
he took us to meet the principal
of the other school. We followed
him on our bicycles, riding
through narrow alleys and up and
down steep hills. He asked us
questions as we rode.

"Do you like to dance?" he
asked. "Do you like to drink and
sing songs?

On weekends we have parties,
you can come?"

At the principals ofﬁce. we sat
on overstuffed sofas covered with
dirty lace doilies as a bespectacled
man in painfully slow English
asked where we were born and
where our parents were from. He
paused frequently to scowl.

We .would be notiﬁed the next
day if we got the jobs, the first
man said, and he invited us to
meet him the next evening to go
dancing.

The next day the men came

back and said I was hired. Leslie
could teach the same class with
me, he said.

"Are there any other students.
Real Americans." he emphasized,
"who want to teach English? My
school still needs a teacher."

Leslie volunteered.

"Oh no, you can go to the
other school. Do you know any
students with yellow hair?" he
asked. "Blondes arc b’etiei."

I later introduced him to one

of my classmates, Joe. a Real
American with red hair.

Joe told me today he and his
roommate. also a Real American,
were hired on the spot. No
interview. No questions about
dancing and drinking either.

"He told us he wanted us be
cause we're white and so our pro-
nunciation is better," loo said.

I told Joe that that upset me.

"Oh, why? There's no reason
to be upset It's no big deal," Joe
mid.

Maybe. But when a man
who speaks marginal English at
bestjudges my pronunciation on
the basis of my race, I am a little
put off.

Somehow itjust doesn’t seem
fair. Growing up in a small
town in the Midwest. I've had to
deal with enough people who as
sume I must be something less
than a Real American beca‘use‘l
look Chinese. Do I have to wage
this battle in China too?

Maybe it's really no big dealt
But it huns as though it should
