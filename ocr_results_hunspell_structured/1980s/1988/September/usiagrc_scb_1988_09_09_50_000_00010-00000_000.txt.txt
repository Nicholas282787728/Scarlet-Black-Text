Chick Corea to Play Darby Saturday

by Dan Capone
This Saturday night Grinnell
Will be graced with the presence
ot’ Chick Corea and the
Electrik Band which will be
ocrl'onning at 8:00 PM in Derby
Gym. Fresh from a summer tour
with Herbie Hancock [sponsored
by Benson and Hedges, which
donated a significant portion of
the proceeds to the National
Coalition for the Homeless and
other homeless relief agencies],
the half of that tour which didn't
attend Grinncll now comes to us.
Corea and his four man band
have repeatedly provcn theme
selves to be one of fusion's best
bands; and their new album, Eye
of the Beholder, has been touted
as perhaps the best jazz-rock al-
bum of the yearr On that album,
Corea, who has long been known
as a pianist and an innovator of
the electric keyboard in jazz, fi-
nally ﬁnds a place for acoustic
piano in a fusion setting. Corea
is accompanied by Dave Weckl
(drums), John Patitucci (bass),
Eric Marienthal (Saxophones),
and Frank Garnbale (guitar).
Corea, born Anthony Ar-

mando Corea in Chelsea. Mas-
sachusetts in 194l, began play-

ing piano at the age of four. He
studied classical piano, before
working as a sideman to Mongo
Santamztria, Willie Bobo, Stan
Gctz, Herbie Mann, and Blue
Mitchell. In 1966 he released his
ﬁrst of over 42 albums, Tories
and Bones. He then joined Miles
Davis' band and played albums
including In a sum Way. After
leaving Miles Davis, he formed
two groups of his own, the
avant-garde acoustic quartet Circle
and Return to Forever. which be-
came the dominant force in fu—
sion music in the mid seventies
From the disbanding of Return to
Forever in 1976 until the forma-
tion of the Electrik Band in
1986, he collaborated with nu-
merous musicians and did solo
work, keeping his acoustic and
electric work separate.

Many jazz purists bristle at
the idea of an electric band. espe-
cially at one that aims, as Corea's
electric hand does, at combining
and blending acoustic work with
electric. Of his new music Corea

Current Shows

Landscape in Iowa:
Prints, Drawings, and Paintings
by Virginia A. Myers, Professor
of Printmaking, School of Art
and Art History. University of
Iowa, Through September 28th
in the Print and Drawing Study
Room, lower level of Burling
Library, Open Sunday through
Friday 1:00 ~ 5:00, closed Satur-
days. The title of the show,
while adequate, does not fully
convey the nature of the works.
The images are not the static im-
ages the title leads you to expect.
Rather than trying to capture the
appearance of the Iowa landscape,
Myers attempts to communicate
the experience of the landscape
and explore the intangible

   

dimensions of human experience,

Through September 30th in
Hurling Gallery, lower level or
Burling Library (the area just
outside the Print and Drawing
Study Room). Open all regular
library hours. This exhibit of
156 prints by artists from the
United States and twenty-three
other countries presents a unique
opportunity to get some sense of
what is being done in printmake
ing internationally. Prints in
this exhibit are available for sale,
inquiries should be directed to

Printh Drawing Study Room.

says, "You can say whatever it
sounds like to you. Any
comparison is reasonable. Like
you could look at the sky and say
it looks like Santa Claus and
that’s fine. Make your own
comparisons any comparison
is legitimate."

While such a laid back attiv
tude may be behind Corea's work,
it is seldom that one has such a
laid back reaction to it. Come
see for yourself, and make your
own comparisons. God knows it
has to sound better than nearly
anything that's come our way in
a while.
