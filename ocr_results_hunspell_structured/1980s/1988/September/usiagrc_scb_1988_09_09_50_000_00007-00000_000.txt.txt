A gainst the Grain

his Week: KDIC-progressive radio or a movement to conformity?

Every now and then, a top
orty song comes out that I like
erc, I said it. Why do I feel
'ke an alcoholic attending my
irst AA meeting? Apparently at
- is school there is some kind of
nspoken mle that says enjoying
e top forty is taboo. At least
. at is the impression one gets if

tion. After all, everyone
ows that people who listen to
l e top forty are trendy, spine-
ss. Socialites who will listen
. and pretend to enjoy, any tune
f that music is "popular". Onc's
ind fills with visions of six»
- nvyear—old teeny boppers hud-
led around their radio while
ichael Jackson dribbles out
ome effeminate ballad about
ow hard his life is. They all
iek with pleasure because after

t as a Child
How about a different per-
pective? A college filled with
r ople devoted to "cool" bands
uch as The Cult or The Specials

or Suicidal Tendencies. Since
everyone knows that liking the
top forty is a symbol of confer»
mity, everyone rushes to find
more socially acceptable musier
0K sociology majors. you
should be starting to see it now
If "conformity" is uncool and
"rebellion" is cool. then in order
to be socially accepted one must
rebel. BUT. if one "rebels" in
order to be socially accepted, then
one has, in fact, conformed.
Confused? You should be,

So what am I saying? That
one must "conform" in order to
"rebel" or "rebel" in order to
"conform"? And what has any of
this got to do with the radio sta-
tion? let me tell you.

Preference in music is some—
thing that varies from individual
to individual The only way you
can truly rebel is to listen to
what you like. and ignore what
people say. It you like C and w,
then by all means, blast it out
the doors and tell the world. As
long as you listen to the music
you like, because you like it, you
are cool.

Now, about the radio station.

As a glanced at my room—
mate‘s DI application I couldn't
help noticing that under the sec-

Scarlet and Black

 

 

"Because life without
conﬂict is boring"

tion for "music interests" there
isn't even a space for "popular" or
"top forty". i believe seeing
somewhere that one of the pur-
poses of the radio station is to
give students a chance to try out
DJing. I doubt that the founding
fathers of the radio station in-
tended to provide the DIing op»
portunity to some. while denying
it to others, purely on the basis
of musical tastes I would even
go so far as to assert that the
music played on the radio station
should reflect the preferences of
all of the student body. as op—
posed to any certain fractionr I
could evengo one step funher
and say that the air time granted
to any given style of music
should be directly proportional to
the number of people in the stu-
dent body who want to hear that
kind of music. but now I am
taking my life into my own
hands.

As a parting shot, I must also
add that it is my tuition money
that is keeping the radio station
on the air. I would think that as
a member of the student body I
should be equally represented in
air time, but maybe this isn't the
way it's done. At least not now.

The philosophy behind SGA,
our sclfrgovcming, student advo-

is simply, simply, simply to do
whatever we can to help the stu-

ced endless meetings and a book
of a constitution to explain that
philosophy thoroughly, but I like
ttom lines as much as the next

"that‘s quite enough philoso-
phizing for this column. What
has SGA been up to lately that
puts that philosophy into pracr
Lice? Glad you asked. Rob has

been organizing your EPCs
(Educational Policy Committee);
those are the folks that represent
your views on academics to the
faculty. We expect some review
of our curriculum this year, and
students plan to be in on the do
cision making. Our other Cabinet
members have been getting their
committees together also. We've
already had a book sale. refrigera-
tor rental, New Student Day's
party, other party planning,
senator elections and orientation,
and bill paying. Whew.

Concerts Committee has put
on some good stuff including
Emo Phillips (that comedian) and
Chick Corea this weekend.
Films Committee got some great
deals on films this semester and
are showing them to packed
houses. Surveys from both
committees should be out next

One more thing needs to be

World at National Affairs
View from the Outside

In lhe last two elections, the
Republicans have been fortunate
enough to have the advantage of
staging their national convention
after the Democrats. With a con»
crete and immediate source off of
which to work. they have become
very good at defining their own
positions by twisting their
opponents’ statements, refuting

their opponents' arguments and
capitalizing on their opponents‘
mistakes, As the final stretch of
campaigning wears on, this may
become less relevant, but it still
states the fact that the Republi-
cans had the unique opportunity
to not only study, but criticize
their opponents‘ national
convention. If the Democrats had
had that very advantage, Michael
Dukakis mi ght well have said in
his acceptance speech:"This elec-
tion is not about ideology; it's
about contradictions."

In such a statement. Dukakis
would certainly be speaking for
himself»an otherwise unashamed
liberal who paints a picture of
himself as a moderate-and for his
ticket-ea pair of candidates whose
diverging views fairly my in the
face of the "party unity" theme.
Even more, however. he would
be speaking of the opposing Rea
publican ticket. and George Bush
himself. both of which have. so
far contradicted themselves in
ways more varied. more interest-
ing. and more likely to make one
question the governing ability of
either.

First of all, Bush has has
contradicted himself several ways
in presenting his image as a can-
didate. The hoped for image of a
ticket with leadership and expert"
enee is tarnished, to say the least,
by the inclusion of a young,
relatively inexperienced Senator,
whom I at least, never knew
anything about (other than his
being Senator from Indiana).
prior to the convention. Further-
more, protestations of Dukakis‘
lake of foreign policy experience
don‘t wash when you consider
that lhc Republican opponent he
charged with the same fault in
l980—-Ronald Reaganvhas in the
last couple of years has had a
surprisingly impressive foreign
policy record. On the darker side
of Reagan's foreign policy record,
the still unanswered question of
just where George was when the
Iraanontra scandal broke out and
during the dealings with General
Norciga cast, not to mention
what has been going on within
the Justice Department and the
Pentagon. really makes a person
wondcr about Bush‘s statement
that "every time I hear that
someone has breached the public
trust it breaks my bean".

On the more personal level
Bush has also been m' g in
roads into dlSpclllng the "elitist
prcppic" image. It strikes me as

 

rather odd, however, that a candi-
date can expect to receive
widespread support among
women voters while he and his
like minded mnning mate oppose
the ERA and abortion, and fur-
therrnore offers a child-care policy
that doesn‘t exactly resolves the
dilemma of working women of
choosing between their children
and their careers. Also it seems
rattler odd that a candidate who
spe aks so proudly of the His
panic blood within his one fam-
ily would refer to his grandson
and namesake as a "little brown
one." Chalk it up to the infa»
mous silver foot if you will, but
it can't be ruled out that there's
some feeling behind Bush's slip
of tongue. Finally, there is the
issue of the paradox of the war
hero running on a “strong de-
fense" platform with a running
mate who had no shame about
reducing his chances of serving in
Vietnam by joining the national
guard. That, however. has been
beaten to death enough by now.
The two particular bones I
have to pick with the 1988 Re»
publican ticket content the much-
vaunted tenet of keeping the fed-
eral government "off of people‘s

 

backs" and the push for God and
the flag in public school class-
rooms. Concerning the first,
passing laws that limit women‘s
reproductive freedom and impose
religion in public schoolrooms
is, to say the least. an odd way of
getting off of peoples' backs.
Tying the second issue to the
first. the very idea of requiring
teachers to lead student in the
Pledge happens to run counter to
doctrine of freedom to practice
onc‘s religion that the Republi-
cans hold dcar. The candidate
who invoked the name of God
and then led the Pledge in his ac-
ceptance speech apparently either
did not know or did not remember
that the religious doctrine of the
all-American Jehovah‘s witnesses
(founded 1872, in Pennsylvania)
specifically forbids the salutation
of any national flag or pledging
allegiance to any nation.

Finally, stepping aside from
Bush‘s policies themselves. it is
nice to hear a candidate talk
specifically about his ideas.
When this same candidate, how-
ever, charges his opponent with
vagueness but then is reluctant to
press for specifics in a debate sits
uation, well, to quote Democratic
keynote speaker Ann Richards,
"this old dog won't hunt."
