Football U
in the Air

by Susan Prout

“We are committed to keeping
the iootball program...There is no
reason why we couldn't be com-

. pet' ve in all sports," said Dee
Fairchild, Director of Atheiics,
Fairchild was addressing a room
lull or varsity football players in
tile first of two meetings held, The
purpose oi these meetings was to
air grievances and achieve a bet-
ter understanding of where the
iootball program at Grinnell Col
lege is heading.

After former Coach John Mar-
tinek's resignation, the team was
shocked and upset. Wally Walker,
acting president oi the college at
that time. was "optimistic" about
the Continuance of the program
Walker ouuined seven ma yor steps
to creating a more sound program:
is Hire a new, experienced head
coach 2» Redouble efforts for
recruits 3, Have all coaches assist
in recruiting 4. Have more help
tram admissxons 57 Widen
geographic and type or outreach
6- Develop stronger alumni and
student support 77 Drier package
assistance for football and other
sports

Walker also stated that the cuts
lege was not going to provide no.
need financial aid or participate In
the ‘ auctitinrbiddlng" for athletes
WhIL‘l’I sometimes occurs between
colleges

Dee Fairchild summed up the
NCAA rules about athletic scholar-
ships as “no special scholarships
given to athletes \illlch are not
given to other special talents"
And because of Grliinell College 5
philosophy in regard to flnanCIal
aid. no special nocneedrscholarc
ships are given as such. Walker
pointed out that "the majority of
students on campus are not special
students [those who would qualify
lor scholarships based on an HP
dlvidual talentl" and that "financ
cial aid is based on the equality oi
students.“

Many or these statements arouse
ed high emotion among the 35
athletes present. And upon Presi-
dclll Drake‘s return. another
meeting was held on February l to
try to reach a better understan~
ding

Present at this meeting were
President Drake, Dee Fairchild,
Wally Walker, John Hopkins
(director of admissions). Charles
Duke idcan oi faculty) and Don
Smith tchair ot' Iacultyi, Coach
Jim Gilbert, and 23 players.

President Drake started the
meeting oti by stating some or the
major philosophies and policies oi
Grinnell College. “The college
philosophy is to have a balanced
athletic program...We will adhere
to NCAA regulations and respect
them...We will also have to deal
with less practice time [because of
academics]...We are not going to
get into a bidding war," Drake
said.

To convey what the admissions
oiiice has done to help support the
program, John Hopkins stated, “I
think the thing admissions can do
is to link the applicant with inter»
mation on campus " Hopkins talk-
ed about spreading the search for
students nationwide. and asked for
help for those already in the pro-
gram. Hopkins also stressed the
need to make the applicant pool oi
potential lootball players more
diverse. when Hopkins asked those
present in the room to raise their
hand it they lived between
Cleveland and Denver. almost
every hand in the room went up
”We need to rcach out to the East
and West said llopkiiis "with
this mo tilion to the East aiid
West." Coach Gilbert added. ”“6
will be identuying athletic (y es
And 1 \\'ill be able to identity who‘s
who."

Football player Paul Winter
nacli also cited the problem with
the attitude taced by players and
recruits on campus "When 1 was a
recruit, I asked about the football
team. and my tour guide told me.
'It sucks!‘ " Fellow team member
Wallace Squibb agreed, notlllg that
publications about Grinnell have
listed the college as “not serious"
In athletics.

"We want to do the best to match
the student to the college." Presir
dent Drake said in closing. And
while there are measures taking
place to extend the reach to
athletes. Drake made it clear that
he would not allow Ior ovcrly

The athletic department has
spent much time in searching tor a
new head coach. They received 39
applications tor the position, and
Dee Falrchild seemed quite pleas»
ed about bringing three 01 those ape
plicants to the campus. A decision
will be made within the next week.

Even with all oi these measures,
President Drake was unable to
assure the audience that Grinnell
will be able to [ield a iull team‘next

More applause. We all thought it
was a nice touch.

Alter dinner, bags were moved
from vehicle to vehicle, the men's
team piled into the minibus, and
the women who were going back to
Grinnell into the other van. The
Kearney meet was to be ian-ly low-
key; Coach Cindy Mueller didn’t
take the whole team because it
wasn't important that ive win, just
that we have the meet. Cindy
believes in reciprocity in schedul-
ing meets 7 this means it a team
comes to Grinnell for a meet, then
we go there. Even ii, and especial-
ly it. the school happens to be eight
hours away.

The meet at Kearney started at
noon the next morning, and we all
agreed it was ”an experience."
The Kearney pool is only six lanes,
has no diving well and only two
permanent stariing blocks tThe
rest were wooden. and someone
has to stand on them to give them
stability when they are usedi But

for Playoffs

by Bryan Coughhn

With their eyes on the possibility oi a playoff berth, the Grinnell
Nighthawks took to the ice last weekend in Peoria, lllinois. In their hrst
matchup, the road-weary Nighthawks were outskated by the Galesburg
Icebergs' Black team, 2 to i The next afternoon, the Nighthawks played
extremely well but Came up short in the third period, t to 2. With two
games remaining in the season. the Grinnell Nighthawks have an ex-
tremely good chance to be one ot the live teams to qualify tor the
Midwestern College Hockey Association league playotis, a llrst in club
history. The Nighthawks have been aided this semester by the outstan~
ding oliense eliorts oi Geoll “Funny Guy“ Larson, and the league's third
leading scorer Mike Jennings. On the delensive side at the ice, Dennis
Gehardstein and Goalie Dave Shane have thwarted the etiorts oi many or
the league's better oiienses. Remember: Be kind to animals ~ hug a
