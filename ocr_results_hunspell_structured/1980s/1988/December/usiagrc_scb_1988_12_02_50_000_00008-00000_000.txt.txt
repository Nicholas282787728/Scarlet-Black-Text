Study break Dec. 13

Japanese print show in Print Room

If you haven't already been,
go see Young Herb: Amttt
Snow: Japan '5 Traditional Print:
in [he Twentieth Century, on
display in the Print and Drawing
Study Room, lower level of
Burling Library, through Dec.
16. This show of 57 modern
Japanese etchings, lithographs,
stencils, and woodblock prints by
over 30 artists, on loan from the
Minnesota Museum of Art (St.
Paul), demonstrates the many
different directions traditional
Japanese printmaking has been
taken in the twentieth century.

Tradition has always been a
strong, dominating force in
Japanese art. Japanese printmakr
ing can trace its origins back to
eighth century Buddhist wood»
block prints. The works in this
show, while sharing this com
than traditional base, range from
the decorative to the psychologir
eaily provocative, the light-
hearted to the serious, the cute to
the delicately beautiful.

The works of two of the
most frequently represented
artists in the exhibition, Saito
Kiyoshi and Sekino Jun'ichiro,
wonderfully capture many of the
currents found in twentieth cen-
tury traditional prints. SekinD's
woodblock Akni Ochiba (Failing
Red Leaf), a decorative work,

and the subtle and rich variations
of texture seen in this wort: are
characteristic of the hanga (or
block prints) included in the ex-
hibition. Another of Sekino's

‘works, his Portrait ofMunakaia,

shows the same deft use of tcxr
ture and color (although the col-
ors are more subtle). However,
they are not employed here for
decorative effect, but to help crcr
ate a powerful portrait of Mu-
ttakata‘s inner character.

Sailo's portrait of a maiko
(an apprentice geisha), Mal/(0
Kyoto, is a quasi-decorative
work. The figure and background
are suggested by ﬂat, near abr
sir-act shapes and are given further
definition by Saito’s use of tex-
ture. This print, like Sekino's
Marta/mm. also shows an interest
in the psychological, although in
a different way. Here the ab-
straetncss of the figure, rather
than its realistic depiction, im-
parts a disturbing sense: this
woman, like all maiko's, is a
mere ornament, lacking depth and
Lrue personality -- she is no one.

Saito's use of simplified,
geometric shapes points towards
an interest in abstraction that is
evident in modern Japanese
prints. This interest in abstrac-
Lion is a natural outgrowth of the
Japanese interest in such ele»

merits as texture and color, and
the traditional non-perspectival
representation of space. Other
works in the exhibition, such as
Azechi Umetaro's Rain, also
poinl towards this interest.

Landscape and the natural
world (birds, ﬂowers, etc.) have
always been vital parts of the
Japanese tradition. as they are
viuti parts of both Shinto and
Buddhism. Artists such as
Yoshida Hiroshi, in prints such
as his Fuji in the First Rays 0/
the Sun, demonstrate the trad-
tional Japanese landscape tradir
tion. Hagiwara Hideo in his
prints Dark at Kawngucltt‘ Lake
and Fine Weather at Nigomc
represents a more modern, lcss
realistic depiction of the natural
world.

The staff of the Print and
Drawing Study Room will be
hosting a study break in the Print
Room during finals week, Tues-
day, Dec. 13, from 9 to 10:30
pm. They invite everyone to
contemplate a Japanese print,
drink a cup of tea, and take a lit-
tle bit of time away from their
studies. But don't wait until then
to see this show. It's well worth
a trip downstairs in Burling.

A Musical Installation: La mat?
:on d'c'ir -- A Musicai Environ-
ment in Arena Theatre, The in-
stallation explores the similarir
ties in the processes involved in
listening, performing, and com-
posing music, Gannon and Kerr
have divided Arena Theatre into
three open, yet visually separate
areas, where visitors can listen

to, perform, and compose music
on two synthesizers driven by
Macintosh music generators.
Although one cannot see between
the areas, one can hear what is
going on in each of the others,‘
thus reinforcing the similarities
between the three activities. The
installation will be open Satur-
day, Dec, 3, from 1 to S p.m. and
Sunday, Dec. 4, from 7 to 11
p.m.
