Iowa State Representative

This is a difficult time of
year if you aren't interested in
politics. Politicians are every-
where polishing up their best
talks, getting thier $30 haircut
and their $400 suits, glad hading
and back slapping their . way
around town. It's easy to become
cynical at the slick ’l'V commer-
cials or the newspaper ads that
shade the truth and are so nega
tive and accusatory. It‘s easy to
resent the process and throw up
your hands and say. "Who cares!
Politicians are all alike and I'm
not voting because it just
encourages them."

This attitude is understand-
able, but it's mostly wrong. I'm
here to suggest politics can bring
out the best in people and that
there are a great number of people
in politics for all the right [63'
sons. In a state as great as ours
most people. Democrats and Re-
publicans alike, are choosing to
play a role in governcmnt be—
cause they want to build and im-
prove our state and they want to
make a difference.

nity does things for the individual

something to the community.

agree. In every community and
every state there are problems
that need solutions, challenges
that need to be addressed, oppor—
tunites that need to be built
upon. In Iowa, for example, our
problems include a lack of jobs
here for the graduates of our col-
leges and universities Our
groundwater is increasingly pol»
luted with farm chemicals. Our
challenges include saving small
town Iowa businesses from the
aftershocks of the farm crises and
drought and issuing the services
people expect from state govern»
ment without taxing them into
bankruptcy. Our opportunities
are many, We have some of the
worlds most fertile soil, alen and
creative minds. work ethic and
neighborly spirit right here in
Iowa. We can take pride in the
fact that we have a crucial role to
play in building a better country
and we have the tools to do It.

I have tried to build a record
in life that makes a difference in
meeting the problems, chal-
lenges, and opportunities our
state faces. Iowa provides the
climate where the offer of help is
readily accepted and ideas and
possible solutions are Iistented to
patiently. Iowa is the kind of
state where the people are great to
learn from and the life lessions
you learn here are sound and wear
well with time,

So while I'd admit to you I
am no honeytongued spellbinder,
I do think I have something to
offer Iowa and (in particular

Poweshiek Co.) I'd like to tell
you what it is.

I try to be a builder and an
optimist, not someone who tears
things down or is a nay Sayer, I
have a bone-deep committrnent to
keeping taxes low because gov—
ernmenr can think of so many
new and better things to do for
you it will take all your dollars.

I respect people like Con-
gressman Jim teach and former
Congressman Cooper Evans be-
cause they are not only smart and
respected, they are uncommonly
decent men as well.

I am sworn to the goal of
providing the business climate in
'Iowa to attract clean industry and
good jobs here and that is vital to
Iowa's future. I am proud that I
was one of 12 legislators chosen
to recicve the N.F.I,B. Guardian
of Small Business Award.

Education is a critical in-
gredient in Iowa's future. At the
heart of everything is a com-
mittment to keeping our schools.
teachers and academic standards
the very best. The policies of
our state should reﬂect our belief
that a better education leads to a
better future for our country.

Finally, I have an
unshakeable faith in the people of
Iowa. The opinions and concems
matter to me and I not only wel-
come, I seek out your ideas. sug-
gestions, and criticisms. We
may not always agree, but I
promise you this: I will always
listen and I‘ll give you that con-
sideration of a straightforward re-
sponse. We may have an honest
difference of opinion. but you’ll
never have to guess what I be-
lieve in.

In the next two years Iowa
will continue to be faced with
impomnt decisions to make. I'd
be honored to have your vote of
confidence on November 8th.
Whether you will be supporting
me or my opponent. though,
please vote. It is the most prea
cious of freedoms and it is a right
well worth exercising

WHY SHOULD I VOTE IN

THE LOCAL ELECTION?
Election Day will come

and go next week and ﬁnally the,

advertising will stop. The results
of that election will continue to
be with us for the next few years.
As a candidate for State
Representative in the 53rd I-Iouse
district, I have often heard people
question the rights of college
students to vote in this county.
My position is clear and concise.
If you have not yet received an
absentee ballot from your parents
home yet and you have registered
in Iowa, you will be fulfilling
your right as a citizen to vote
here for a person of your choice.

My rcasoning, you may
ask. As a student at Grinnell,
you will have spent three of the
last four years. physically living
in Poweshiek County and the
53rd House District. You have
become a vital part of a progres-
sive community. Local govem-
ment has provided you with the
basic services that taxes pay for,
such as mental health services. a
strong economic business dis-
trict. water, sewer, police and fire
protection, roads, stcets, and an
expanded new airport that en-
hances the community. In rcr
tum, you have paid your tuition
at the college. (which is Grin»
nell's largest employer) brought
jobs to hundreds of local people
and cnduced excellent professors,
teachers and professionals into
the community because of the
college. You have given Grin-
nell sound economic base to
build on, You shop in the
stores, eat at the restaurants. and
provide a cultural climate that
would not be available to this
size of community without
Grinnell College.

I, as a candidate, have is
sues that are foremost in my rea-
sons for secking this elected of-
frce. I will not support a "tax
amendment" that will cap rev-
enues collected by local govem-
merits and limit the ability of

citizens to have "local control."
The amendment that I am oppos-
ing would have the same cffectas
Proposition 13 did in California.
It would severly handicap our ed-
ucation system in Iowa. elimi-
nate the need for school boards,
city and county government and
put the power into the hands of
150 State legislators in Iowa.
The ramiﬁcations of this amend-
ment are far reaching and eventu-
ally would lead to higher taxes
through user fees for the low in-
come and lower taxes to the
wealthy. I will not support this.

There are positive things
that can be done locally for our
district. As a legislator, I will

work to retain the quality educa-
tion system we have. I will work
to help local businesses obtain
funding for projects that enhance
the community. and 1 will be»
come an active voice on the
groundwater and environmental
issues that face our state. I have
been an advocate for services to
the Mentally Ill and Mentally
Retarded and underprivileged citi-
zens of our community.

You. as a college student,
have every right to vote in the
local races. You are as informed
on the issues here as you would
be in the local races where your
parents live,

I ask for your vote on
November 8. Your vote could be
the deeidin g factor in a very close
election.

Vote MONA BOND, November
8.

I am writing to solicit
support for my candidacy as
Sheriff of Powmhiek County,

I am a life long resident of
Poweshiek County I am a High
School graduate and a veteran of
the Korean war. I have been

married 33 years and my wrfe,
Neva, is employed at Grinnell
Mutual. We have two grown
children.

Since the completion of
my military I have dedicated my
career to Law Enforcement.
Starting in 1955 sewing 10 years
on the Grinnell Police Depart-
ment. I left as a Sergeant to be a
Deputy Sheriff. In l968 1 was
elected Sheriff and have served as
Sheriff since that time.

During my career I have
tried to continually update my
training. I havc been to Iowa
University Police School. Iowa
Law Enforcement Academy, Fed-
eral Jail Management School and
many other Schools on Civil and
Criminal Law.

Since being Sheriff We
have remodeled the Jail, trained
and now use a Reserve Deputy
program which donates about
1500 hours a year, freeing other
Deputies for other duties.

Both of my parents retired
from Grinnell College buildings
and grounds. Both children are
college graduates so I have some
knowledge of College life and its
problems.

In closing I would ask that
you compare qualifications of the
Sheriff candidates then vote Max
Allen on November 8th.

Thank you for your support.
