Women’s Swimming:
Season Summary

by Lynn Freeman

“We love it. Cindy, we love ill”
We didn't think it would ever end.
But, alas, the women’s swim team
linished the season with a 2-point
lead over Lake Forest two weeks
ago, and we loved it. We knew it
would be close, but how could a
team oi 23 redheads possibly lose?
Well, we came close to linding out.
with a 2-point victory, you know
that every swimmer counted:
every place. every point. We
couldn'thave done it with any less.

Lake Forest took many more
iirsts than the Grinnell team tthey
had 13, we had 5;, but Grinnell won
with depth, which is what we've
been doing all year. oi course, the
meet was not only between Grlnr
nell and me, but also Lawrence
(3), Coe (4), Ripon (5), Beloit (5),
Cornell l7), and Knox (8) The last

conterence title by the women's
team was in 1933; Lake Forest and
Coe have shared the title over the
last tour years. The team as a
whole periormed better than they
expected, and it paid oii,

The highlight oi our weekend, it
it wasn't the red hair, was Wat-
ching the two coaches and the
president periorm daring teats tilt
the threesmeler board. Yes, that's
right, President Drake did a swan
dive ott the high board. Guess he
wasn't a Rhodes Scholar tor
nothingl tA tine example at broad
llberal~arts training.)

Well, training is what we did,
and what some at us are still do.
ing: Katy Furnish, Debbie Koa,
and Colleen Murphy are oil to na.
tionals in Atlanta, Georgia, Good
luck!

by Joe Lewis

NO, Grinnell has NOT reinstated
its ROTC program! N0, the con-
certs committee has NOT booked a
15 member punk rock band to per-

yes, it is that time of year when the

its annual male bonding ritualll
The campus has been lniiltrated by
skinheads, snakeheads, asparagus
heads. deadheads. bullheads,
fuller brush heads, Cranium Bob
heads, bristlehcads, pinheads, and
Buddha heads, And what do each
of these heads have in common?
All oi them are slightly swollen,
because Buddha has regained its
title as coiiierence championl!

After months oi preparation.
Buddha was at last given the
chance to reclaim victory in the
Mldwest Conference, The team
answered the call with iearlul pro-
wess. leaving Lake Forest and the
other MCAC teams in a watery
grave. Combining the legendary
tapers 01 Coach hay Obermlller
and a dedication rarely seen at this
level of Competition. Buddha shat-
tered existing point records. Every
team member had outstanding
perlormances. surpassing all cx-
pectatlons Withasmlle on his face

that could open a branch ofﬁce,
Coach Obermlller remarked, “If
this doesn't return Grinnell to
number nine in USN&WR then i
don't know what will.”

Buddha celebrated victory with
a banquet at Grinnell House on
Monday evening, Following the
sumptuous (east, Coach Ober-
miller presented several awards to
the team members. A plethora at
service and letter awards were
presented. In addition, a number of
special awards were bestowed tor

dividual team members. Tom

mances in the 200 I M, and the 200
breaststroke. Freshman Dave
Troy received the most improved

conierence periormances in the
1650 freestyle, the 500 freestyle.
and the 200 fly made him the odds
on favorite [or the award. Senior
Bob Wandling was honored with
[he most Valuable swimmer

award. This is the third year that
Wandling has received MVS,
marking a successful finish to an
admirable swimming career at
Grinnell. Finally, captains Kyle

cl a successful season will live on
in the hearts and minds of all. it's
time to relax. put up your ieet. and

said, .,Buddha's Backl!

Tracksters Regain Youth,
Finish Strongly at Conference

by Katherine Fairbanks

This Friday night, while many
Crinnellians were packed shoulder
to shoulder in Norris Lounge con-
templating sale sex, some or the
best athletes in Grinnell were her
vously awaiting the start at the
Midwest Conierence Indoor Track
Championships at Cornell College.
By the end oi the meet on Saturn
day, the Grinnell men’s and
women's track teams dispelled the
notion that schools with toprnotch
academics do not produce top-
notch athletes.

The men's team garnered 108
points over the [wasday span to
iinish second behind Cornell, while

—‘ the women‘s team was sixth in a

held at ii. The men placed in 14 or
16 events, with two scorers in both
the 800M and the two-mile. Greg
Evans continued his rampage in
the 1000M and the mile, while

David Hammond and Jonathan
Lave dominated the rest of the
distance field, with their one-two
performance in the [\vormlle. Wall
Maley contributed a helty number
or points to the team score.
ﬁnishing ﬁrst in the 600M, third in
the 300M, and second in the 200M
relay with teammates Tom Mc-
Cullen, Tim Grossman, and Dave
Jones.

Accomplishments in the field
events included a trio oi second
place finishers: Mark St Andre In
the long jump, Kirk Marty in the
pole vault, and Henry Vogelman in
the shot put. Vogelman, who beat
out a freshman lrum Rlpbn College
with his final throw 0147'7”, ex-
pressed rellei that he had not lost
his touch and commented to one of
the younger members oi the team,
”it's nice to know us old»llmers
can still show you young bucks a
thing or two." Mark St Andre,
although Just a sophomore, also ex-
perienced renewed laith in his
abllities and remarked, ”I thought
I'd reached middle age and was
over the hill. but now I know I'm
still young and virile." It is hoped
lhal the rest oi the team is likewise

experiencing those teelings oi
vitality and youth and will reach
their potential in the upcoming out-
door season.

The women, despite a small con
terence team oi just nine
members, placed in nine events. in
the high Jump Abby Green and
Karen Drinkwater placed second
and sixth respectively. Adrianne
Clark demonstrated her prowess in
the mid- distance/distance events
with a sixthrplace iinlsh in the
isotiM on Friday and a iiith-place
finish in the 1000M on Saturday,
which established a new Grinnell
College record of 2:512 a almost
tour seconds taster than the
previous record ol 2: 53.0. The iiith-
place linlsh by the 4x400 relay
team tJoanne Sackett, Earl) out.
lrin. Melinda Collins. Kristin
hicherti was also a remarkable
teat, considering that the baton
made momentary contact with the
track during the second leg oi the
relay.

The success at the indoor cham-
pionships should spring the men's
and women's track teams to an ex.
citing and promising outdoor
