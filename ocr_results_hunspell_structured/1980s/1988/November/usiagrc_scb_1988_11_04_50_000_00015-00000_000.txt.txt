Alright, the games of
the XXIV Olympiad have been
over for more than a month now,
and to be perfectly frank, I'm a
little disappointed. No. not
that they're over (they lasted the
right amount of time). I'm dis-
appointed due to the "antivSeoul"
attitude which pervaded much of
America .. at least those to
whose conversation I was privy
(or eavesdmpped on),

During the two and a half
or so weeks NBC televised the
Games, I got a strong sense
that people were more than fed
up with the Olympics. A nega-
tive apathy, if you will. plagued
the minds of more titan a
handful of Americans Many
US citizens (generalizing from
Grinnell, of course) were sick of
seeing Bryant Gumble's perfect
smile and meticuluous attire (or
Gayle Gardner, Bob Costas or
Ahmad Rashad, depending on
what hour you tuned in). They
wanted "them," as they so elo-
quently referred, to "just go
away," as if the Games were
some annoying pest. This am-
bivalent attitude disgusts me.

A lather straightfoward, ra—
tional response would be one
that is commonplace among anti-
censorship folk: if you don't like
it, then don‘t watch it, Simple,
and to the point. After all, it

wasn't being broadcast on all
the channels; there were more
than a few open. even without
cablet While 100% correct in its
rationale, this approach just
doesn't cut it -» at least from
my perspective. There‘s some-
thing underlying this ambiva-
lence which makes the
whole anti-censor "thing" only a
ﬁckle solution.

Be you an avid sports fan
or simply someone who occa-
sionally enjoys "seeing a
score," the Olympics should be
appealing It's a spectacle that
happens just once every four
years, and should bechen'shed
as something special, not
ridiculed as something drawn-out
and sensationalized.

Along those same lines.
however, you need not be a
lover of sports in arty way.

shape or form to enjoy the
Olympics, I would tend to think
that the pure sense of excite,
ment that even the opening
ceremonies brings would give a
few skeptics goosebumps. And
that says nothing about the un-
forgettable events themselves,
which invariably (unless you‘re
comatose) generate fascination,
causing you to cheer uncontrol-
lably for athletes you have
probably never heard of, in
events you don't even fancy.
They all envokcd heart—
pounding memories From the
pint-sized power of Janet Evans
to the sheer strength of Matt
Biondi, to the almost nonahu-
man talent of Carl Lewis to
the awe-inspiring determination
of the family duo -- Florence

Kersee .. the list is endless Each

wherever they competed. there
was so much on the line 77 more
than your run—of—thc-mill Sunday
ballgame -- that I fail to unv
dcrstand how people can criti-
cize, be they "patriots" or not.
Pride, envoked here by our na»
tional heroes, is immeasurable.
That's acceptable, people
eventually concede, but why did
it have to "drag on so
long." 1 think that is
relativlcy self—expalnatory. There
were simply too many events -—
from fencing to synchronized

moreover, did a tremendous job
in covering all of these sporting

to Beloit. Grinnell finished 4—7 on the year.

Women's soccer
closes out fine season

Despite dropping their
home finale 2-1 to Beloit to go
4-7 on the season, Grinnell
women's soccer coach Ted
eskildsen had praise for his
troops. After starting 0-5, the
Pioneers fought back with a
4-21 record in their last seven
outings, Many teams would
have simply folded and called it a
season, which makes Eskildsen
proud of his team's perserverance.
He said, "We showed a great deal
of character from beginning to
end"

The Pioneers played good
defense all season, allowing
less than two goals per game.
Eskildscn sees defense as the
main twgredient in developing a
quality SL seer program

In on.” its second year as a
varsity team, Grinnell has a
bright future. Six freshmen
played for much of the season,
and the team of 24 will only lose
six seniors this year.

The Pioneers tough loss to

conference foe Beloit put their
league record at 14 on the
season. Beloit took a 2-0 lead
before Grinnell's Stephanie Reis-
dorf headed in a Sara Conner
cross. The Pioneers battled for
another goal, peppering the Buc-
caneer's net with 30 shots. but
could not lie the game,

Coach Eskildsen was
somewhat disappointed with the
loss but looks for success in the
future. "It is imponant for us to
continue to improve our skills.
Also, I hope to have an excellent
recruiting class to balance our
team."
