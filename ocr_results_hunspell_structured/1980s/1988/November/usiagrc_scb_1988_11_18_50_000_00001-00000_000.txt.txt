Grinnell College, Grinnell, Iowa

NCA evaluators
assess Grinnell

by Jennifer Watson

This week, from Monday.
Nov. 14, through Wednesday,
Nov. 16, a team of teachers and
administrators from various lib-
eral arts colleges were on the
Grinnell College Campus to
make their recommendations for
the re-accreditation of Grinnell
with the North Central Associa-
tion (NCA).

During the past two years.
in anticipation of the accredita»
tion team's visit, Grinnell pre-
pared a self-study which assesses
how well the college is fulﬁlling
its mission. The NCA Steering
Committee, which prepared the
self-study. consisted of staff and
faculty members and was chaired
by Charles Dukc, viceeprcsident
for academic affairs and dean of
the faculty.

The Steering Committee
sent surveys out to faculty mem-
bers, students, and alumni, as
well as to different administrative
offices such as the Ofﬁce of Slur
dent Financial Aid and the Ofﬁce
of Minority Affairs. The results
of the surveys were then studied
to see how well Grinnell is actu-
ally accomplishing its stated
mission of being a college "that
seeks to develop in students both
analytical and imaginative think-
ing in the liberal arts . , . to edu~
cate citizens and leaders for this

republic and the world beyond its
borders”

The selfrstudy determined
that the College is developing
strong writing skills in its stu
dents but that oral skills are
weaken Copies of the study are
available on reserve at Burling
Library and at the SGA ofﬁce for
student inspection.

The accreditation team
conducted interviews on campus
with faculty, staff, and students
to determine how accurately the
self-study reﬂects actual condi-
tions on campus. The team will
now assess how appropriate the
mission of the college is. After
this assessment, it will try to de-
ten'nine whether the college has
the ﬁnancial, human, and physi-
cal resources to accomplish its
mission in the future.

Accreditation with the
NCA is based on the team's rec-
ommendations. The team's re
port suggests possible areas of
improvement and cites areas of
panicular strength, It also tests
the college's self-study for accur
may and completeness. The team
recommends accreditation for a
period of time lasting from one
to ten years. The college has the
right to question and appeal the
ﬁndings of the report. Grinnell
was last inspected in the spring
of 1977.

Walker not set to resign until 1995
McConnell sets eyes on V.P. job

by Kim Eckart

In the recent North Central
Association self evaluation, Dine
ing Services Director Dave Mc-
Connell expressed his personal
goal to become Grinnell College
executive vice-prCSidenl during
the 1990's.

The position, currently held
by Waldo Walker, will not be
open until Walker retires after
1995.

”My individual goal is to

become a senior finance director
at an institute of higher educar
lion. At Grinnell, that position
is the equivalent of executive
vice-president," said McConnclL
Walker recognizes Mc-
Connell's goal, but emphasizes
that the character of the position
may be altered after his retire-
ment. "There's no guarantee that
the definition of my position will
be as it currently is," Walker

said. "It‘s not likely to be the
same as it is now." Walker cmr
phasizcd that there is no inside
"grooming" or preparation for
McConnell‘s possiblc promotion,
but acknowledged his agreement
with McConnell's intentions.
"If. whcn my position becomes
available, he should wish to ap-
ply for it, that's perfectly all
right," Walker said.

Student
attacked

in OCCO
house

by Jessica Weisel

On Saturday, Nov. 12, two
men dressed in black entered an
off-campus house and assaulted a
student in his room.

"They said, 'We have a
present for you," said the student.
who asked that his name be kept
anonymous. "[They] burst in,
Lied me up in duct tape, and tell a
note in my month." he said.
"Frankly, for the first part of it, I
thought it was a joke. They took
me completely by surprise."

The student‘s wrists and
ankles were tightly bound, and
the note said, "Stay away from
my girl friend"

"I have no idea what [the
note] means," insisted the stu-
dcnt, who is confused by the at
tack and the reference to the
"girlfriend."

Prior to the attack, the vic-
tim received two phone calls
which he originally dismissed as
meaningless, The ﬁrst caller, on
Saturday afternoon, asked if the
student was going to the Waltz.
When he responded that he would
be going, the caller hung up.
The student ﬁgured it was simply
some friend whose voice he had
not recognized. Later, half an
hour before the attack, a second
caller, possibly the samc person
who made the first call, asked if
the student was home, After the
student said yes, the caller hung
up.

Since the attackers entered
the house through the back door,
no other members of the house
realized anything was amiss until
thc student called for assistance.

After the student was re-
lcased by surprised housemates.
Tom Crady, dean of Student Af-
fairs was notified Cmdy told the
student to call the police who
were quickly on the scene to in
vcstigatc.
