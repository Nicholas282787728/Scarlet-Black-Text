costs oi present renovations, the
administration is saying that the
new student center might simply

protester Leil’ Larson. "We can't
have that. It'll stand there [or the

Committee Plans Women’s
Studies Concentration

by Debbie Chase

Because Grinnell is one oi the
law remaining colleges in the
Associated Colleges oi the Midwest
(ACM) to be without a major,
minor, or concentration In
women's studies, a committee oi
students and iaculty is worklng to
develop a concentration in the
iield.

In order to develop a core [or the
concentration, the committee is
trying to locate courses that
already have an advanced locus on
women's issues as well as courses
that contain a law oi the necessary
perspectives. Currently there are
two proposals ior tuliilling the 22 to
25 credit hours needed ior a cone
centration.

One option includes an
introductory-level course; a mid
level, team-taught course; and a
two-credit senior seminar. The
other option consists or an in»
troductory course, a senior
seminar. and three or tour eleo
tives. The committee, which in»
cludes eight iaculty members and
tour students, hopes to have the
proposal ready by the end oi this
semester to present to the cure
ricular councillor approval

Though the committee has not yet
completed the concentration, other
stops have been taken to include
women's studies In the Grinncll
curriculum. Mary Lynn Broe. pro-
iessor ot women‘s stud' s and
English, has been appointed to
chair a women's studies program.
During the ACM conierence on

April 8, the committee organizd a
protest, which, according to com~
mittee member Fred Morris, was
held to let the administration know
oi the wide support [or implemenr
ting a women's studies program at
Grinnell. Also, President George
Drake has officially recognized the
concentration.

In addition, several protessors
have begun redesigning their
Course curriculum. Edward
Phillips, associate proiessor oi
classics, changed his classical-
mythology course to include
feminist interpretations oi the
myths studled. He eliminated the
textbook he had previously used
because it did not locus on issues ol
gender. Christopher llunter
modiiied his sociology course on
deviant behavior to include
women's perspectives, and Tom
Hictcla has Included a leminist ape
proacli in his history classes

Despite these advances.
members of the committee still
recognize problems. According to
Roberta Atwell, proiessor oi
education, Grinncll is “many
years behind" and needs to push to
receive mayor outside iunding ior
curricular development, Many
other ACM colleges already get
grants ior “omen's studies, and
Grillnell needs to mark this as one
of Its priorities, Alwsll said

Broe cited a problem with the
women‘s histor} poSltion. She said
that the administration did not try
to hire a professor during the ﬁrst

wave oi hiring in September, but
waited until now to begin hiring.
which, according to Broe. is a
disadvantageous time ior hiring.
Atwell also noled that although she
requested a permanent position tor
a women's history proiessor, tor
the past two years the administra»
tion has only allowed ior lemr
porary ones,

Another problem, said Broe, is
the administration's iailure to
recognizc tully the amount oi sup
port ior women‘s studies at Grin-
neII.

“There has never been a mo
ment when there was so much in-
tercst amongst [acuity and
students in terms oi curricular
changes and research advances,"
said Broe. But Drake and other
members oi the administration do
not seem completely to recognize
this, according to many members
oi the committee

Though the committee is work
ing hard to develop a concentra-
tion, many do not think it is wise to
create a major. "1 don’t think it's a
good idea at a small school to have
an entire women's studies pro
gram. It’s impractical to create an
extra arm." said Bree.

“My goal would be to eliminate a
women's studies motor." said
committee member Rob Killion,
“Someday it should be common
practice to include every segment
ot’ our socicly. not Just the ivhite
males. into lill courses *'

DJS Never Had
First Warning

by Debbie Chase and Dave Jones

Last week, disc iocheys oave
Sleinman and Bill Collins were
permanently suspended irom
KDiC, the campus radio station, on
the assumption that they had
received a warning from a
previous oiiense Though a iirst
warning must be given belore a
disc jockey can be permanently
suspended, neither KDIC station
manager Wayne Seaman or KDIC
adviser Steven Jones claims to
have issued a warning.

Earlier this semester Steven
Jones received Complaints concere
ning Collins and Steinman's radio
show. In passing, Jones said to Col-
lins that he had “heard some
things about the radio show," to
which Collins replied that he “had
it under control.” Seaman claims
that this constituted a ﬁrst warn»
ing, When asked. Jones said that
he does not give warnings and that
only the executive staff of KDIC
can give warnings.

in an attempt to avoid iuture
problems, Seaman presented a
series oi a rules and regulations to
KDIC disc Jockeys at a meeting
Monday atternoon, Seaman said
that (he KDlC stall. In conjunction

Computer Mail
System Shuts Down

by Jonathan Andreas

Dreams, Grinnell's electronic
mail program, was shut down tem~
porarily this week {or repairs. At
10 p.m. on Wednesday, it was no
longer possible to send mail. and
AVAC. BVAX, and CVAX users
had until 5 pint Thursday to read
all their mail which they had not
previously read.

Grinnell College Computer Ser-
vices contacted James Allen, a
Grinnell alumnus who authored
the program, and the decision was
made to start over and delete the
entire unread mail file. When the
program shut down, the unread
mail file was deleted. By 6 this
morning, all electronic mail ser
vices should have been running,
All BITNET mail that had been
sent while Dreams was down was
then forwarded. All mail messages
which you have read and saved
still exist and Dreams should now

be functioning as reliably as ever.

Each night the central mail tile.
which stores all unread mail, is
compressed to save space. All oi
the mail tiles which have been read
are then deleted from the central
mail tile. This process has re-
quired increasing amounts oi time
because the central mail iile
became corrupt possibly due to a
system crash during Christmas
break, Sometimes the process took
all night and part or the nextmornr
ing The problem is increased
because some people never log in
and read their mail Their unread
mail takes up unnecessary space
and increases the time requlred to
compress the central mail file.

One oi the side eiiects oi the prep
blem was that people sometimes
have been locked out ot the mail
system during the night.
