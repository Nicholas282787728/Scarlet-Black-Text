KDIC Incident Blown out of Proportion

Luc Hatlestad

That deafening silence you heard
all last week was emanating irom
KDIC. 885 FM, the selfe
proclaimed “leftist station on your
FM dial." The shut-down was a
result of the incidents of the
previous Saturday, when three DJs
offended some members of the
campus community with a iew un-
savory remarks about women, But
was the subsequent iuror ol this
audio iaux pas completely
justified?

Apparently there was a substane
tial number of complaints leveled
at a particularly degrading rap
tune. The validity of the phone
calls is not in question, as much of
rap music contains sexist epithets
The Dds, eventually becoming ime
patient with the callers, dug
themselves into an inescapable
hole when they responded by direc-
ting a iew obscene comments at
women in general.

As expected, the staii oi KDIC

and SP and R responded quickly »

and effectively to the incidents,
closing the station for a week and
relieving the three Dils of their

duties. This move was ap
propriate, as it demonstrated to
the listeners of KDIC that the oc»
currence was an isolated one, and
it did not reflect the sentiments of
the radio station ol"the college.
With townegown relations as
precarious as they have been, the
timing oi this decision was essen-
tial for the station to retain its
credibility.

We all knew, oi course, that the
next issue of the Scarlet and Black
would contain a news story as well
as a letter or two explaining or cons
demning the incidents, The fact
that we were treated to six
separate pieces illustrated the
degree to which the whole thing
was blown out oi proportion (as
well as how pitiiully iew things
happen on this campus). Parts oi
the letters to the editor, as is usual
ly the case, were iueled by emotion
rather than rationality and a com-
mand of the facts.

The complainers seemed to be
particularly oiiended by the iact
that the DJs were making their
disparaging remarks under a veil

Education, not Punishment

To the Editor:

I am responding to the recent
KDIC controversy. it was sug
gested in the last issue oi the s and
B that Bill Collins, Dave Steinman,
and Brian Berger may be taken to
JudCo. Although I'm not aware ii
any decision has been made up to
this point, i don’t believe that this
is the best solution to the problem

They‘ha'iie’ ”been punished ior
breaking the FCC rules, and they
should not be punished by JudCo or
by the campus community ior
holding their particular opinions.
It is uniortunate and rather
pathetic that Bill Collins believes

women are “too tucking weak”
and that he was unproiessional
enough to make such a comment
on the air, but he is entitled to his
opinions and does not deserve to be
punished ior them. This campus
and the world in general are not as
open-minded and liberal as many
people would like them to be.
Education, not punishment. is the
answer to this problem. increased
education will help to tear down
the walls oi sexism and prejudice,
while punishment will only reins
force them. 7 Kirsten Senquist

Prosser Responds
to" Allegations

To the Editor:

This letter is in response to last
week's letter from Kate Leonard
and Caty Forden. I’d like to start
out on a positive note. i have seen
Ms, Leonard's work in the Fine
Arts lobby, and while I have mixed
reactions to some oi the work, i
find her print, “Roommate" to he
an specially pleasing composi-
tion,'with strong contrasts oi light
and dark. i am disappointed that
no one informed me of the ex-
istence of the exhibit. I did.
however, hear that there was a
new exhibit early on, and made a
special eiiort to see what was up.
My response was positive, but i did
not have much more to say abiv it
beyond what I have already said in
this paragraph. Certainly, that
would not make ior a very eiiec-
tive article, If Ms. Leonard or Ms.
Forden would like to see higher
quality in the Scarlet and Black’s
articles, 1 suggest that they
themselves write some articles. I
would certainly appreciate that
kind oi help, which would repre-
sent a positive eiiort on their parts
to improve what they see as an
untenable situation.

At this point, I‘d like to suggest
that Ms. Leonard and Ms. Forden,
being visual artists, rethink their
opinion of ”the irrelevant ancient
architecture oi campus buildings.”
This opinion seems to ignore the

fact that campus architecture in
volva planning, composition, and
design every bit as much as do Ms.
Leonard's prints and drawings
Also, we should take careful con»
sideration of the buildings' design
and execution ior reasons that go
beyond the merely aesthetic: they
are where most of us spend a large
portion or our time at Grinnell, and
a well-designed building is simply
more livable,

‘ in my work as an arts editor, 1
have regularly overseen the
publication oi articles on music,
exhibitions, movies, architecture,
and books. Since both Ms. Leonard
and Ms. Forden are ireshmen,
they may lack some knowledge oi
what the arts pages have been like
in past years. i believe that i am
the iiist editor regularly to at
tempt to get articles on current ex-
hibitions. During this semester, I
have succeeded in getting articles
on most exhibitions in Burling and
a photo exhibit at the Community
Center’s gallery, as well as air
tempting to recruit an article on
the recent Fine Arts exhibit of stu-
dent prints oi .the past ten or so
years (but my eiiorts came too late
7 the Show was almost overt. Last
semester, exhibition reviews
resulted from my work and en-
couragement. — Vincent Prosser,
Arts Editor

oi anonymity. in actuality, they
had been airing the same show at
the same time tor the entire
semester, and their names are pro
minently displayed at various
points around campus on those
charts that KDIC makes available
twice a year. The only anonymity
in this case belonged to the callers.

Other backward notions observ-
ed in the letters were the idea that
the station chose to broadcast the
remarks, and that it is the respone
sibility of the DJ to disassociate his
or her opinions from those of the
station. SP and R showed their
non-support oi the DJs by tiring
them immediately alter they had
collected the facts. The station
cannot be expected to have a
24-hour watchdog assigned to cen»
stir the shows. That is why the FCC
exists. And just as the S and B ex,
presses their independence from
the opinions oi their writers, so
must KDIC.

The most asinine idea of all is
that there exists a strong possibille
ty Lhat the three DJs will be taken
to Judicial Council. Any such
charges brought against them
would be unjust and would be a
mockery oi the iunction oi JudCo.
The remarks made by the DJS
were neither premeditated nor
could they be called harassment.
The incident was an isolated one
which resulted in a punishment
handed out by the only group with
jurisdiction in the matter, 1(ch
and its officers. If this case were
prosecuted by JudCo, it would set a
precedent by which anyone could
be tried on the ground that he or
she attended someone.

The uproar over this issue il-
lustrates the kneeejerk manner in
which “liberalism” is oiten car
ried out on this campus. Many oi
the accusations made against the
DJs were voiced out oi anger and
with little regard for the facts and
the boundaries oi jurisdiction. Fur»
thermore, the items in the S and B
were not representative oi the en»
tire campus, not because the com-
plainants mentioned in the first
news story and the letters were all
women, but because they all live in
the same house, But perhaps their
comments were merely the most
articulate oi the complaints. If so,
how does that reflect upon the rest
oi the campus population? Are we
all sexist, apathetic, conservative
it), or just plain stupid?

Student Criticizes

Movie Review

To the Editor: "

i am writing to respond to a por-
tion of Matt Macho's review of
“Parting Glances" which does not
rest well in my mind. in the
review, Macho says the iollowing:
”No doubt latent homophobia will
keep much oi the campus irom see~
ing either this film or i3 counter-
part. ‘Daert Hearts.’ ” What
upsets me is that Macho seems to
be aggravating the problem rather
than working to change the
negative attitudes which unfor-
tunately prevau on this campus.
By making such a sweeping
generalization, Macho might well,
be throwing another log on the con~ i
suming iire oi homophobia instead ‘
oi extinguishing uie ﬂames. it is
fortunate that Macho vents his
frustration and anger during Les- ‘
bian/Gay Pride Week so we may
learn that we must seek to end
homophobia here and elsewhere
through more constructive means,
rather than by hurling insults and
comments at each other.

On Second Thought

Bill Lohaus

When leaving Quad the other day
with a friend, I learned that he was
angry about the way that shirts are
sold to raise money. He cited the
fact that there were no more “Free
Nelson Mandela” shirts, saying
that though Mandela hadn't been
ireed, people would ieel silly sells
ing more shirts because they
hadn’t made a difference last year.
He went on to say that ii people
were willing to make a REAL
sacriiice tor social justice they
would give up beer ior a semester
and give the money to the causes
they supposedly support. Knowing
the amount of Rolling Rock that he
drinks in a semester, his would
certainly be a substantial contribu»
tion.

What this raised in my mind was
that we tend to take Certain
aspects oi our standard oi living
ior granted. Beyond the necessities
of having BASlC food, shelter, and
clothing, We‘ve become iirmly at-
tached to many luxuries that we
just do not need. Do we need iancy

homes, gourmet food, and ex-
travagant clothes? What about
VCRs, TVs, and PCs? Do we
NEED hundreds (if not thousands)
of dollars worth of music? What
about alcohol and other drugs" We
have been conditioned to believe
that We need all of these things,
and we will continue to amass
them after we leave here.

And i do mean continue; by this
point the pendulum has been set in
motion. Part oi becoming
established is having a music cola
iection, and a car, anda home, and
a TV, and a library, and a war-
drobe. and a pool, and a club
membership, and a summer place,
and vacations, and on and on and
on until our entire lives may be
summed up by the number oi
things that We own. Yuck. We will
not be content to live simply. We
think that these things are
necessary ior the human condi
tion; we will not question our ex-
istence sufficiently to realize that

Evans, Killion Explain
Steinman Appointment

To the Editor:

For the last two weeks we've
been spending our evenings cone
ducting interviews for cabinet and
committee chair positions. We had
around 40 applicants ior the eight
positions available, so the selection
process was iairly lengthy.

The appointment oi Social Coor-
dinator was one oi especial impor-
tance because that person will be
an integral part oi the new Films
and Concerts Committees struc»
ture. After careful deliberation,
we've become confident that Dave
Steinman is the person for the job:

1) Dave has been the SGA
Treasurer ior two years and has
the perfect credentials for {inane
cially advising the committees.

2) Dave has traveled to the
University oi iowa and Cornell Cole
lege to lnvatigate their programs
and look ior methods to improve
our present system,

3) Dave will be a somewhat rare
third-year cabinet member next
year, and his perspective will be a
valuable one.

4) From working with Dave ior
over a year, we are confident he
can deal aggressively with film
and concert agents, a skill that is
invaluable to a successful bouker.

5) Dave has a working
knowledge oi the ACE, Films, and
Concerts Committees because he
has been a member of the first, and
he has handled the ﬁnances of the
last two.

7) Dave's final qualification is
that intangible quality oi en»
thusiasm. lie has impressed us as
someone who not only can do an ex-
cellent job. but someone who is as
excited as we are about the
possibilities for our Films and Con-
certs Program next year. We are
convinced that our program would
suiier in his absence.

We’ve detailed the rationale
behind appointing Dave as Social
Coordinator because we want the
campus as a whole to share our
coniidence in the job he’ll do. We
reahze that Dave has recenUy
been involved in the KDIC cone
troversy, but we are judging Dave
on his oualiiications and job per-
iormance over a two-year period
and not on a single incident.
Whatever remaining uneasiness
we had in how the new structure
will function through its first year,
Thanks to everyone who applied,
and we'll keep you posted. Pro»
