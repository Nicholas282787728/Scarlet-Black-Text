SEA Urges Support of
Divestment Initiative

To the Editor:

Although the trustees claim in
our current partialrdlvestment
policy. “Whereas. the trustees oi
Grinnell College have round and
continue to iind the apartheid
policies oi the Government oi the
Republic oi South Africa to be
morally repugnant and un-
forgivable," we have iound the
trustees to be more than iorgiving
with their actions,

Grinnell College has not divested
and will never eilectively divest
with the resolution that was passed
in was. The time has come ior a
new policy oi iull divestment irom
any companies that have not cut
oii all ties to South Airica

The current resolution adopted
in 1935 is iull of loopholes which
allow the trustees to avoid divestv
ment. claiming that “on balance.
la company's involvement] has a
constructive or detrimental imr
pact on human rights in the
Republic oi South Airica.“ The
iact is that human rights in South
Airica are eroding more and more
as lime‘goes on due to the op-
pressive regime In any struggle
ior .ir'eedom, sacritices must be
made. in the case oi the black
South Atrican youth ipost-pubei-ty
through midrteensl such wills
ingness to stand in mm or a row oi
machine guns. with a Molotav
cocktail in one hand and a stick in
the other, is obvious.

To be objective, there are many
reasons ior as ivell as against
divestment:j'ro‘;be'realistic, there
are‘people who are tortured and
killed daily under the South
Aii-ican apartheid regime. it we
are to truly consider the interests
oi the oppressed. we must ioi-tiiy
their struggle with total economic
disengagementThuS ‘tudentinr

Renovation Committee Member
Responds to “Misinformation”

To the Editor:

1 would like to respond to and
clariiy some oi the misiniormation
in the article “Students Protest
ARH Changes" in the April 221ssue
oi the Scarlet and Black.

Three years ago. the Faculty
Renovation Committee ior ARH.
Goodnow. and Steiner was iormed
to begin planning the renovation oi
ARR. The committee. chaired by
vice President Walker, included
nine iaculty members and three
studene Since that time. many
studies have been made. reports
written, meetings held. and cone
cerns discussed regarding
classrooms, oiiices. audiovisual
equipment, and computing
lacilities The students have been,
and continue to be. included at all
levels The activities oi the com
mittee are reported to SGA Joint
Board ior inclusion in the all
senators' posted minutes.

Alter a study oi space needs and
audiowsual center requirements,
it became apparent that the ARH
auditorium space would have to be
incorporated into the second and
third iloors. Anticipating the loss
oi the movie theater. it was vice
President Walker who asked the
students to investigate alternate
spaces tor a theater and perhaps a
general recreational building ior
students, in response to his re
quest, the students iormed the ad
hoc Committee to investigate a
New student Building and
developed several proposals. in-
cluding one which involved the
construction oi a new building and
one which included student use oi a
new zoo-seat auditorium or a
theater addition to ARH, On May 1,
1987. the committee voted 8 to 3 to
restrict ARH to academic uses.
thus excluding student recrear
tional iilms. This is how the iate oi
the auditorium was determined.

The architect tor ARH. Ben
Weese. has expressed his resolur
tion to preserve those aspects oi
ARH ”that represent quality and
history" oi the building such as the
marble in bathrooms and the ter-

As ior the student social center.
it too has been given a greatdeal oi
attention by both the students and
the administration. With its
establishment in late 1986. the Stu-
dent Building Committee, con-
sisting of seven students, began
surveying. researching. and
writing various reports documen-
ting, in detail. the social and
recreational requirements on came

ty oi other campus organizations,
was given consideration The com-
mittee’s primary task, however.
was to convince both the trustees
and the administration that a stu-
dent social center was the only way
to meet these requirements and
that it was a ieasible project, with
the help or Dean Tederman and
President Drake. the committee
lobbied the trustees at each of their
meetings, Finally. aiter the come
mittee's presentation this past
February. the board or trustees
was convinced that the social
center is needed Plans for iunding
campaigns and the selection oi an
architect ior the building are now
underway, Space allocation and

sidered until aiter an architect is
hired.

Inaccurac1es
To the Editor.

I do not often write the Scarlet
and Black. but the quotation made
in last week‘s paper about plans
for the new student social Center
were so inaccurate that they need
to be addressed, One is a quotation
by Leif Larsen. “..,the administrar
tion is saying that the new student
center might simply be some
cinder-block affair.” Another
Statement ‘is. "KDIC'S need for
space in a new building was com-
pletely ignored by the people in
charge until students went before
the administration." Yet another
quotation oi Yaman Ogut's is, "AS
future alumni of this College. we
find it difficult to believe in an in-
stitution that so consistently lgr
nores the opimons oi its Students,"

For the life of me. I do not know
where people got this iniormation
other than irom their own imagina-
tions.

1. There is a very active Student
Social Center Building Committee
composed oi Cathy Baldwin
(chair). Sam Perlman. Dar]
Russell. vicki Seely. Chris Gunst.
Jeff Peirce, and Erick Rogers.

This committee has been very ace
tively involved in working with the
administration ior over two years
and has met twice with the
trustees. l iind it diiiicult to believe
that this constitutes ignoring the
opinions oi the students.

2 To my knowledge no one has
talked about this building being.
“some cinderrblock aiiair." in
tact, the concern has been that it
blend in with and complement the
other buildings on campus An are
chitect tor the building has not yet
even been selected.

3. 1am the person who originally
suggested that we should consider
placing KDlC in this building. 1
also asked both the student
building committee and Steven
Jones lKch adViser) to talk to
KDIC and find out about their reel-
ings about being in the building
and their space needs.

The quotations in this article br-
ing to mind a quotation by Edmund
Burke: “It is a general popular er-
ror to imagine the loudest com-
plainer ior the public to be the
most anxious ior its welfare.” —
Jim Tederman. Dean of Students
