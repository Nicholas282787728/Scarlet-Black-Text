Labels, directories
distract from issues

To start this column, I
would like to welcome to
Grinnell all incoming freshmen,
transfer students, and exchange
students. You are here. As I
look around the campus, I see
nothing much has changed over
the summer. The three
directories are still with us; while
removed temporarily for
cleaning, they remain
monuments to the vastness of
Grinnell. If it weren't for those
directories telling us where we
are, we would all lose ourselves
in the maze of sidewalks, trees,
and buildings that comprise
Grinnell College. Three hearty

—-John Newmark—

cheers for the administration's
decision last year to construct
these necessities, instead of
spending our tuition on such

frivolous things as new
professors or more books for the
library. Some people

complained last year, even I did a
little, but I now see the purpose
in it all. I hope they are all
cleaned and restationed quickly.
so that we don't have to spend
too much time without them.
iThe nine liberal-arts colleges

,and World Report list all have
directories; therefore, we must
.have them loo.

On the positive side-yes,

titan they. However, it is also
nice not to have to type on a
keyboard where half the keys
stick, and won't work unless you
apply 100 times the normal
pressure, and then usually print
in duplicate or triplicate; and the
other half of the keys have all
lost their caps, giving your
ﬁngers blisters and sores. The
VT3005 are pure heaven in
comparison.

Politically the situation is
going in reverse, with the
Presidential candidates getting
less and less intelligent and more
and more primitive. As I
listened to the Republican
convention, I found myself so
revolted I turned off the TV in
the middle of many speeches
The sum of the speeches helped
me to realize that for the
Republican party, the most
important role of the government
is militarily to protect the
citizens. The education. health,
and ﬁnancial well-being of these
citizens don't mallet. They do
mention these in their speeches,
brieﬂy, but when 90 percent of
the speech is dedicated to how
strong the Republicans are on
defense, and how weak Dukakis
is, it's not difficult to realize
where they place education,
health. and poverty on their
priority list. Bush's campaign
film consisted mostly of
references to his war days, and
there was a big argument over
Quayle's being in the National
Guard of Indiana and not in
Vietnam during the war. The
primary purpose of a citizen is to
fight in the wars. Or more
appropriately, it is the purpose of
the noble born citizen, since this
is what both Bush and Quayle
are. The lower class doesn't
matter, their job is to till the
ﬁelds and grow the crops. It
seems the Republican Party has
devolved all the way back to the
feudal system.

My other political
complaint of the summer is the
dreaded "L" and IC" words. What
do liberal and conservative mean?

The Human Element

Last week I ran down the
Johnan family dog. Whurnp.

It had been that sort of
summer, endlessly unevendul. l
was driving home from work in
the Beast1 a '69 Jeep Wagoneer of
ill-repute for its gloriously
bouncy ride, tinny AM radio, and
excessive mst. The interior was
all crapped up from landscape
work, the windows slick with a
greasy dust film. Those sod
scraps in the back end breathed a
wet, earthy musk, reminding me
that supper was waiting“
overeooked teriyaki chicken
leftovers, home-grown corn, and
a tossed salad. My stomach
growled with anticipation.

Early evening stained the
cloudless sky blue, warm and
clear, deepening to summer
nighttime. The street was
desenod. The midasized black and
gray dog unexpectedly
materialized in the middle of the
road, trotting, tail aloft and
waving. happily innocent of
danger. Even as I wrenchcd the
steering wheel, I could see the
dog wagging its body joyously,
then yelping and embracing the
edge of the fender, and the
shudder of impact. I stomped the

brake and squealed a quick Q» .

turn.

I left the Beast idling and
lurching, and crossed to where
the dog lay whining, high—
pitched and agonizing. Its right
ear twitched and perked forward as
I approached; the left was
crumpled under its head, pressed
to the blacktop road. It lay on
its side, legs stretched awkward
and stiff. Only the curled tail
moved, beating weakly against
the pavement. I stroked the dog's
neck gently. Through my
ﬁngertips, I could feel labored
breathing beneath the rufﬂed,
unevenly graying fur.

Chris Johnson came running
from across the street. I hadn't
seen him since junior high
school, when we used to
slingshot crab apples into the
sides of passing cars and cut class
to smoke cigars behind the fence
across the street. He used to tell
fart jokes. Now he looked like a
clean-cut frat boy...who still told
them. "What happened?" he
asked, kneeling across from me
over the dog's body.

"She jumped right out. I
tried to swerve..." The dogs lids

were fluttering. I-lis fingers

"C'mon Trixie, stay awake."
he murmured. She shuddered.
He looked up from the dog to

me. Recognition flooded his
face. "Hey. I know you!
You're..." He snapped his

ﬁngers to click his memory. I
said my name. "That's right!
Jesus, I haven't seen you in
years! What‘re you doing
nowadays?"

Just then, Mr.lohnsen
struggled across the street. l'd

forgotten that he had a limp.
"What happened?" he said,
kneeling with some effort across
from me over the dog‘s body.

"Dad, why don't you go get a
board so we can slip Trixie on
and take her to the vet?" Chris
evidently had decided to take
charge. Dad accepted the order
and ranrshufﬂed back. passing his
daughter.

"What happened?" she asked
running up, breathless I
watched the word MURDERER
scroll across her eyes. She was a
very aturictive youiiguwomanr v
was thinking. And people have
met in crazier situations... Then
I mentally kicked myself.
"Dad! C'mon, hurry up!" Chris
yelled.

"Stop yelling!" his sister
snapped. Her nostrils ﬂarnelled
angrily. Then she glared at me
too. I felt subdued and wooed,
all at once.

The Mister returned at a
loopy cantor, carrying a piece of
paneling. Gently, Chris and I
eased Trixie on and carried her to
the house. We slipped her in the
back of the shiny red lohnsen
family pickup truck parked out
front, and the sister climbed up
to sit with the dog. Just then,
Mrs. Johnson skipped lightly
out the front door. “What
happened?" she asked, without a
trace of concern.

"Mom, guess who this is?!"
Chris said enthusiastically.
Social hour again, I thought. I
told hon-my name, and how the
dog had come to be stretched
across Pitkin Ave.

She looked at Trixie
sympathetic ally. "This is so
sad. I never did pay much
attention to the dog.“ Then she
turned back to me, at once a
bubbly socialite. "So, what'rc
you doing these days?" I told her
i was going to Grinnell, in Iowa.
"lowa!!! lgrcw up iti Amos!"

"Oh? Did you go to Iowa

State?"
"No. but Dick did!"

"I've got to go to work,"
Chris interjected. I said I had to
leave too, and offered to call
later. His sister was crying in
the truck.

"No. we'll be eating dinner
and playing bridge at the Silvens‘
house on Constitution," said
MrsJohnsen "You can look it
up in the book and ring us
there." I agreed to do so, and
turned to leave. "Wait," she said,
grabbing my elbow and giving
me a giant hug. "Thank you
much for being so nice and
stopping..."

hung up.
