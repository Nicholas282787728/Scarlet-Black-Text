Men's Soccer

Another championship con-
tender is in prospect for Coach
John Pfitsch as he prepares for
his 15th season as Grinnell Col-
lege men's soccer coach.

In the Pfitsch era the Pioneers
have won six titles in the south
division of the Midwest Confer-
ence, and in 1984 won the over-
all championship Last season
Grinnell lost to St. Norbert, 3-
1, in the playoff

This year the Pioneers are re-
building after losing four key
players at that position. Re—

_ tumees include Co-Captains Brad
Bisgard, a defender, and Randy
Seeley, goalie. At forward the
top two scorers, Austin Sim»
mons and Ian Lorimer, are back
along with midfielder Andy
Laing. All ﬁve won allaconfer-
cnce recognition last season.

Top freshmen include forward
Lovanh Nanh and fullback Matt
Schrager.

Though fairly well stocked with
tal< cm in a squad of 47. the
Pioneers may find it difﬁcult to
improve on their ‘87 dual record
of 7-53 because of a demanding
schedule.

Women's Soccer

After posting a respectable 4-5-
2 record in their ﬁrst year of var-
sity play, the Grinnell women's
soccer team anticipates further
progress this season.

Coach Ted Eskildsen returns 22
players from the ‘87 squad and
will add a group of talented
freshmen. Junior Captain Kathy
Zabel and sophomore Jennifer
Hooper anchor the defense while
senior Tahnee Robertson and
Danielle Aoki fuel the offense.

The Pioneers have revamped
their schedule to include more
Midwest Conference opponents
and an east-coast tour during fall
break,

Women‘s Cross Country
The women's cross country

team is out to improve on its '87

fifth-place conference ﬁnish.

Coach Evelyn Freeman will try
to mix a group of promising
freshmen into her young squad.
Top returnees include sophomore
Katherine Fairbanks. who was
fifth at the conference meet, and

 

      

senior Captain Ashley Abelr
Freshmen Heidi Freihurger of
Dubuque and Christine Thorburn
of Pleasant Valley appear to be
top prospects.
Freeman described the team as
young, and will look for a group
of sophomores and juniors who
have little experience to fill out
her top seven spots.

Men's Cross Country

The Grinnell men's cross coun-
try team, having broken into the
national rankings the past two
seasons, will try to find its way
to a third consecutive Midwest
Conference championship.

Led by senior Greg Evans. a
two-time individual champion,
the Pioneers boast a youthful but
deep lineup. Sophomores David
Hammond, second in the confer-
ence meet last year, Mark Couch
and Todd Rowekamp will all
support Evans, Junior Jonathon
Lave rounds out the top re-
tumecs.

Coach Will Freeman will spice
up his lineup with a host of
strong freshmen. Expected to be
top performers are Guy Potter of
Ottumwa and Jason Maples of
Cedar Rapids. Both harricrs had
quality high school careers.
Addin Cardella of Bethesda. Md..
and Dave Peterson of Milwaukee,
Wis.. also appear to be top re-
emits.

Women's Tennis

Coach Dec Fairchild will con
tinue her work of building a suc-
cessful women's tennis team.

Last year the Pioneers placed
ninth at the Midwest Conference
meet and they hope to climb the
ladder this year with a veteran
team. Seniors Lisa lepsen,
Apryl Henry. Elizabeth Warner
and Julie Najita will team with
junior Erika Smith to give the
Pioneers good depth.

Heather Radaoh, a freshman
from Des Moines. placed in the
slate meet twice during her high
school career. Fairchild also
looks for freshmen Jennifer
Wang and Elizabeth Banfield to
be top players.

Women's Volleyball

Women's volleyball is off to a
fresh start under a new coach,
Sheila Cain.

Teams prepare for fall season

 

 

 

With the addition of new coach Greg Wallace and one of the largest freshman classes,

the Pioneers hope to to imrove on their poor showing in 1987.

Coach Cain is impressed with
the attitude and work ethic of her
squad of 16 that includes six let-
terwinners.

Veterans on board include the
'87 team's top middle hitter,
Melissa Fitzpau'ick, and the
number one settervoutside hitter,
Joanne Sackett.

Football

New coach Greg Wallace, who
comes to Grinnell from Centre
College of Danville. Ky., is
looking to improve Pioneer
football fortunes with the help of
one of the school's largest in-
coming freshmen classes.

On-field leadership is expected
to be provided by a quartet of se-
nior co-captains: Jim Weiland,
quarterback; Paul Manternach.
running back: Wallace Squib,
defensive lineman/linebacker; and
Rob Boardman, defensive line-
man,

The Pioneers return 18 starters,
11 on defense and seven on of—
fense. Punter Scott Truesdell led
the league with a 39.0—yard aver-
age last year as a freshman.
