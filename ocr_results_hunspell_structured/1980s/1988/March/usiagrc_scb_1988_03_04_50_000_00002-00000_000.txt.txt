First Strike

We. the students ot Grinnell Cola
lege, formally request General
Secretary oi the Communist Party
oi the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorr
bachev to include Grinnell College
(410 44' 50” N latitude, 920 43’ 30"
W longitude) as a primary target
in the event ot a nuclear exchange.
We make this request tor two
reasons.

The students of Grinnell feel that if
the college were to be included as a
primary target, we would gain an
increased appreciation oi the con-
sequences ot nuclear war, It is our
belief that an increased understan-
ding would encourage students to
work toward peace and an end to
the nuclear arms race.

Moreover, the students of Grinnell
College believe that in the event oi
a nuclear holocaust, the quality or
life will be so insufferable as to be

children are without permanent

About 20 percent oi these people
are employed. in lowa, there are

Taking into account the above
evidence, we are appalled by the
actions taken by the Reagan Ad-
ministration and Governor Terry
Eranstad. Since Reagan has been
in office, Aid to Dependent
Children has been reduced by 33 a

billion; the Food Stamp program
has been cut by $6.8 billion and
beneﬁts have been reduced for an
additional 20 million people; and
mortgage tax exemptions for
middle and upperrincome
homeowners have grown to $42
billion while housing programs tor
the poor have been cut 75 percent
Today. more than iour million peo
ple in the United States are living
below the poverty level than did
before 1980. On June 9, 1987, Goverv
nor Branstad vetoed $24.24 million

money. in October, an extra 325

Nuclear Arms

We, the students oi Grinnell Col-
lege, recognize the threat oi the
nuclear arms race which is
perpetuated by the United States
and the Soviet Union, In addition,
we acknowledge the increased
danger posed by nuclear proliiera-
tion which allows many nations ac
cess to nuclear weapons and
weapons technology, Moreover.
the arms race is not only a threat
to our Future and the iuture oi the
global environment. it is also
economically impractical because
it drains the resources oi the US.

he hope to accelerate iurther
ncgoti tions towards more restriCr
lions nit weapons with the iollowtng
suggestions:

l Given that Nuclear Testing
fuels the arms race and allows the
creation of increasingly dangerous
weapons, the United states should
pursue a Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, eliminating weapons
development, A Test Ban would in
crease National Security by
preventing new technology irom
becoming a reality. Additionally, it
would benefit the environment,
reduce nuclear proliferation, and
save taxpayers‘ money.

2, The Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty (ABM) must be interpreted
today as it was when it was signed
in 1572. The objective of the treaty
was to insure a balanced and
verifiable limitation on strategic
weapons, while increasing the
mutual security of the United
States and the Soviet Union, The
ABM treaty is the only agreement
in existence which has successiully
discouraged the development oi
speciiic weaponry. and the
United States must preserve the
precedent set by the treaty to give
credence to future arms control
measures.

3. Given that the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). if im-
plemented. eiiectively violates the
ABM Treaty, all eﬂorLs toward
deploying the space system should
be terminated. Research and
development for space-based
deiense are excessively expensive
and funds devoted to such projects
could be allocated to more produc
live scientific endeavors,

Gay Rights

It is the behei oi the students of
Grinnell College that as citizens of
the United States, gay and lesbian
people merit and are entitled to the
same legal rights as other
Americans as guaranteed by the
US. Constitution and Bill of
Rights. The struggles to Win such
basic rights ior women, blacks,
and other minorities, while not ,
over, have met with considerable
success; it is now time to end the
oppression and persecution of
American's 22 million gay and les-
bian citizens. Such discrimination
is not only callous and immoral but
is also clearly against the national
interest. Job discrimination, for
example, leads to a squandering of
talent and a waste oi human
resources which our country can ill
afford.

t We support an end to
discrimination based upon sexual
preference or orientation and
believe it should be considered
equivalent to other forms or
discrimination tie, racial or
gender) and thus rendered illegal
as well as immoral.

2 We urge the president to issue
executive orders to abolish
discrimination based on sexual
preierence in the federal govern-
ment, espccially in the military.
which continues to discriminate
against gay and lesbian personnel
in spite oi the national interest.

a We further urge the president
oi the United States to issue ex-
ecutive orders to end discrimina»
tion against gays and lesbians who

seek to emigrate to the United
States .

4. We believe the 14th Amendr
merit to the US. Constitution
should be expanded to include
discrimination on the basis oi seXr
ual preference in its enumeration

oi unlaniul and immoral types oi
discrimination

5. We Call for an end to
anathronistic state and municipal
sodomy laws, such laws alienate
large numbers oi American
citizens. constitute governmental
iniringeinent upon tiie privacy oi
its citizens. and senselessly render
a segment ot the population
lawbreakers.

a. We urge states.
municipalities. and the federal
government to recognize the
validity oi samcsex relationships
as equivalent to heterosexual oncs
lor all iinancial and legal pur-
poses.

We, the students of Grlnllell Cola
lege hope that our voices, along
with the voices oi a growing
number of Concerned Americans.
will be heard. and that tlic
discrimination, persecution, and '
oppression oi the more than 22
million gay and lesbian citizens oi
tins country will come to an end.
