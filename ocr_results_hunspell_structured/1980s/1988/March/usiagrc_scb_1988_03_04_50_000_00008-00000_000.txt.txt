Review

by Thomas A. Beverly anti Eric
Johnson

The st are a band that has met
ivith critical acclaim but little
popular support Current band
leader Peter l-lolsapple took over
otter the departure or Chris
Stamey tor a solo career, and is
now chiet songwriter. rhythm
guitarist, and keyboardist. The
st are part or the wave or
southern guitar rock bands, but
play a lighter. more melodic sort or
pop than their counterparts. Their
new album. “The Sound or Music."
is the st' attempt at a
breakthrough to the kind or
popularity enjoyed by bands such
as REM. and x, but will probably
remain mostly in the college radio
ranks.

ERIC: I round “The Sound or
Music" to be more consistently ape
pealing than the st’ earlier
albums while still sticking close to
their traditional tormula. Nothing
too heavy here: catchy melodies,
vocals pleasant with just a hint or
edginess. lyrics about broken
hearts and broken dreams You'll
probably like it the ﬁrst time you
hear it, although it might not stand
up to repeated listening. Two songs
that l really liked were “Never
Belore and Never Again" and “I
Lie," which has gotten some

airplay While these guys aren’l
pushing any musical boundaries or
even trying to. they are good at
what they do. so I‘ll give them a B.

TOM’ This album doesn't seem to
accomplish anything that the ribs
haven't already done On previous
albums, Holsapple can still write a
song when he wants to. but there
are 12 on this album and only three
or tour decent ones. "Never Say
When" is a good album openery
with “I Lie" and "Never Betore
and Never Again" on about the
same level, but most or the rest of
the material is hopelessly shallow
and boring. An ambition of the dEs
seems to be emulation DI the
Replacements, but instead they
frequently lapse into Hoodoo
Gurus-like mediocrily, with
uninteresting melodies and lyrics
that wouldn‘t challenge a Tyear-
old The whole album sounds
watered-down and restrained.
without a single good rocker; it is
limp and tireless, but somehow still
slightly above average, which is
both a tribute to the kind of talent
these guys must have somewhere
inside them and a comment on the
rather sad state ol popular music.
Worth only a C.

 

Concert on

Saturday in
North Lounge

by Leir Larson

Swinging trim the ratters, im-
mersed in shaving cream, rolling
on the dance tloor e whatever,
Run Westy nun ROCKS. So you
say you like the stooges. Johnny
Thunders, the Rolling Stones; well,
I've got a band ror you. Run Westy
Run jumps on a hit and rides it tor
all it’s worth and then som bobb-
ing and weaving, choking and
wheezing, across the stage a rew
times and then straight to the tloor
And what is rock and roll supposed
to be but rive guys with hats head»
bumping into each other and

laughing and occasionally railing,
but generally just stomping the
hell out of some or the meanest
licks this side or “Search and
Destroy"? l-leck, l bet Aerosmilh
used to know how to rock this way
before they sold out and Steven
Tyler started looking about 20
years older than Mick Jagger. So,
go grab yourselt a sinpack or
Colt-45 tall boys this Saturday
night 7 maybe even a case 7 and
get down to North Lounge at 9:30
pm. to see the real thing and break
some sturi,
