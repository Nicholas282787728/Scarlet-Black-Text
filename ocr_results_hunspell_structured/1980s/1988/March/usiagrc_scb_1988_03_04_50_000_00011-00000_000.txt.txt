Scarlet and Black

Track Team Names Theme Song, Set for Sat Meet

by Katherine Fairbanks

Arriving at the tail end of the
a: lirldrlOroclock practice, I touiid
a motley crew oi runners who were
willing to otter their comments on
last Friday's Iowa State Small Col-
lege Championships. The distance
crew had some excellent perior~
mances. Greg Evans managed to
break the Grinnell loco-meter
record, which he established last
year. In the realm oi temale
distance runners, Adrianne Clark
was the Stand-out, finishing fourth
in the lowemeter and coming
withintwo seconds ot the school
record. She will be attempting to
break that record in this
Saturday's conference meet at
Cornell. Spectators are heartily ine
vited to road-trip to Cornell with
the team,

The sprinters did not tare as well
as the distance runners in last
Saturday‘s meet. The ”meter
relay team, consisting of Tom Mc»
Cullen, Tim Grossman. Dave
Jones, and Walt Maley, were on
course to break the school record,
but encountered a problem: their
legs were moving lightning-last,
but the baton wasn't keeping pace
Still. they said, “It wasn't bad tora
bunch oi slow white guys." The
sprinters, who were stretching out
near the radio, also commented on
their inspirational new theme
song. “Lucille." by Kenny Rogers.
I'm sure you have all heard it, but
to refresh your memory: “Picked
a line time to leave me, Lucille,
tour hungry children and a crop in
the field ” Obviously, the Song is
pertinent to the Grinnell track
team, since it mentions "crop" and
“field," both important aspects ot
Grinnell, This upbeat song, with its
tast tempo. is certain to arouse the

competitive spirit of the sprinters,
Walt Maley predicts a good meet
this weekend. saying, “We're pickr
ed to finish high, despite the tact
that we play by the rules." Austin
Simmons said that he “would like
to run under two minutes," (For
those oi you who have never run
track and do not instantly connect
two minutes with the 800»meter,
mat is the race in question here.)
The women sprinters are a small
but potent group of runners. Bar-
bara Duftrin offered a more pro-
found analysis ol the women’s

team: “The strength at the
women's team lies not in its size.
but in our belief in each other and
the support we give one another."

of course, track is not all runns
ing. and theretore I must not
neglect the field events. Untor-
tunately, 1 was only able to speak
with one representative or that tac-
tion —— Henry Vogelman. His com»
ments were tairly personal 7 he
said that he wanted me to make it
known that when he throws this
week, it won't be in technicolor.

Finally, I asked the coaches [or
any inspirational comments they
might have From their relative
silence. I concluded that they abide
by that wondertul philosophy that
since it is really the athletes who
make the team what it is, they
should speak about their own sue
cesses Men‘s coach John Sanford
Reinhold did eventually provide
me with a few grains ot insight,
saying. “training has gone really
well and in the last meet the team
scored in almost every event. Wha
more can you ask for?” Best o
luck to the Grinnell indoor track
and-ﬁeld team at this Saturday'
conference meet.

has already started an exodus
from the private networks to
public TV Bob Keeshan. known as
Captain Kangaroo, is among the
most prominent to make the
switch, While he was on CBS when
I was a kid watching his show. he
can now only be found on PBS, This
is a good indication of what is hapr
pening at the three major net-
works. Keeshan realized that the
networks are caring less and less
about what they show, and more
about how many people watch it.
No longer are they providing a 59rr
