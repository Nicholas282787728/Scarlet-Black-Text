leader in the introduction of hybrid
corn or American agriculture. The
exhibit is to some extent about the
changes brought to iarm culture
by such technology. Munroe has
tried to capture what he has called

values or the iamily farm were
mixing with onrushing technology
and the efficiency of agribusiness
consolidation."

The Good Earth

“The Good Earth" is a very long
ttwoand-ahali hours) t937 movie
starring Paul Muni and Luise
Rainer, This adaptation of Pearl
Buck's tale oi a poor Chinese
tarmer whose rise to success and
wealth is tollowcd by disaster was
among the most famous and suc-
cessiul Hollywood prestige produc»
tions oi the '305; it has stood the
test of time. even without the ad-
vantage oi the amber tinted prints
in which it was initially released

Paul Muni gave a much admired
pertorrnance in the central role
and Luise Rainer's sensitive and
splendidly controlled playing won
her an Oscar. The convincing
locust-plague sequence. which was
one of the most extravagant
special effects set-pieces of the
era. was achieved by superlmpos
ing coiiee grounds lloating
downwards over iieids oi ripe
wheat drenched in crude oil.

Godzﬂla
by Alessandra Bocca
Hmmmmm...Godzilla. let‘s see.
Now, this is not the Deep Purple
song or a new action figure from
He-man. This is the movie ~ the
real thing. This is classic monster-
movie fare fit for the whole family.
But it you haven't started a family
yet. it's still a worthwhile trip to
the ﬂicks, if only to realize how far
special- -eiiecls technology has pro-
gressed in your lifetime.
“Godzilla" stars a lizard about
one- -iourth the size of Tokyo who
decides he likes raw people better
than raw fish. There’s lots of ex-
ploding buildings and
pandemoniom in the streets. This
is the kind of classic film that
spawned other classics such as
“Food of the Gods" and “Squirm.”
it also ieatures the kind of expert
dubbing techniques found in many
Bruce Lee movies. “Godzilla" is a
must for any monster connoisseur.
and for those who just dabble. I
guarantee you'll at least have a
more prolound understanding or a
lot of “Far Side" Comics.

Enter the Dragon

by Matt Macho

While there are and probably
were a few people who could out~
iight Bruce Lee, there has never
been nor ever will be anyone to
match his charisma and style in
martial-arts movres. The legenr
dary Bruce Lee is in top iorm in
“Enter The Dragon.” his first star-
ring role in a featureelength movie
arter years oi choreographing the
fights in ”The Green Hornet"
televismn series. A big hit at drive
in theaters across the country
when it was iirst released years
ago. the movie started the whole
martialarts tilni genre and re
mains the greatest film of its kind
ever made.

While the plot is pretty rudimen-
tary tLee is recruited to investigate
a sinismr dnig lord’s mysterious
island headquarters). it served
quite well to set up the action.
which is what the lilm is about. Lee
and other martial artism compete
in the drug lord's Kung Fu tourna-
ment (some excellent kickboxing
here). and when Lee’s cover is
blown the mass mayhem really
begins. The final battle between
bee and the drug boss (complete
with artificial hand attachments)
in the boss’s hall of mirrors is
especially spectacular and has
spawned literally dozens of irnita-
lions.

Skeptics who base their opinions
about this type oi film on the
trashy Saturday alternoon chop-
socky flicks will be pleasantly sur-
prised 4 “Enter The Dragon" was
filmed with a big budget and was
welledone; the cinematography
and cameras are excellent and
nicely complement the havoc of
combat,,Bruce Lee is the only man
(besides Jim Morrison) whom
legions of fans believe is still alive
in spite or his 0. D. over a decade
ago. Go see “Enter The Dragon
his greatat movie and you will
have an idea why
