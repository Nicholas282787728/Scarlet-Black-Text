S-I Teams Hit the Nets

by Brendan Shepherd

February 193i notes the return of
the greatest sports competition
known to man. Games that test the
skill, the endurance, and the will of
their participants. However. they
will go unnoticed by the general
public due to the networks’ choice
to cover the Olympics instead.

Despite the lack of live media
coverage of Grinnell‘s special-
interest basketball, it continues a
sporting tradition that is as old as
time ltseli. While 1 don't claim to
be a sorcerer oi the sports scene. I
will nevertheless hazard a guess as
to the winners and losers based on
my gut feeling tcaused by a halfr
cooked piece of chicken Marco
Polo),

Of the three Tutorial Memorial
Dlvisions: Holland "Fennls" Neal,
Bill “Chill” Jahn, and Curious
George Mchmsey, I'd have to say
that the weakest isBill “Chill"
Jahn. Right off the bat. take the
name. It has more Is than any
other. One could say it is laden
with Is Thus, I believe this is in-
dicative of a lot of losers.

“AIDS" has to be looked at as a
favorite of the .lahn division but
some say “AIDS” is all hype. i
doubt that a cure will be
discovered this season. They will
be involved in pos eason play
despite compet' on from
“Pioneers" and “Keg Busters.”

I don’t know if “4 Squirts and a
.Ier ” refers to the players or to
what they do when they're not
practicing. I predict they'll get

their hands on everything but a
championship.

“Bricklayers" will be putting up
a lot of the same despite a firm
ioundation, and you can expect
"Flying Disco Explosion” to die off
sooner than white bellvbattom
tuxes. i don't think even Jimmy

Scarlet and Black

Cllitwood could prevent “The

Hoosiers” from Settling on the bots ’

tom.

In the Curious George Mchmsey
division it could be "PMS" time all
the time unless their play is air
fected by “Stiff Hooters,” “Home
mer of Thor" should do well unless
“Blood Blisters" develop and they
lose their grip “Dangling
Modifiers" will drop off and “Piss
Shivers” will go down the toilet,
With a few ~roster changes from
last season. "The Null Set" returns
and will probably keep their
perlect win record. zero, intact,

Lastly we turn to the third and
final division. Holland “Fennis”
Neal, a division which should pro-
ve to contain the most interesting
battle for the championships, Not
even a Ph.D. from Yale is going to
help “Faculty/Staff" deﬂate "Big
Rubber Duck,” although the old
folks should finish high in the divi-
sion The “Duck” will definitely be
a big factor in the Neal division.

Members of Econ House form
the nucleus of “hrs", Some say
they could be contenders, but when
they get it together it might be too
late. The Pin Dicks of “Shamu”
will, I predict, find themselves
with a “Genital Wart" at the bot
tom of the division. “Affirmative
Action” will see much action after
the regular season. One to watch in
Neal is a group ot newcomers call—
ed “Prisoners of Gravity." They
could be a surprise and defy the
law by rising to the top instead of
sinking to the bottom.

So close and yet so far away.
They had it, but then they lost it.
You could just about smell a vic-

yet another close one, this time to

"The game against Coe — which is
the most talented team in our con»
ference A was one of our two best
games all season (the other being
Cornell). We ran our game plan to
a T."

While the nine-point defeat
doesn’t exactly illustrate quality
play, the coach’s assessment is ac-
curate; his players deserve praise.
The pioneers were able to play the
game at their tempo, silencing
Coe's two top scoring powers.
Sacrificing his body on a couple of
charges, Steve Logsdon took emote

game, The Pioneers also held
Coe's dangerous point guard Scott

only five points for the night. They
unlortunatcly came in the crucial
last minutes. Good ole “crunch

Friday’s game proved to be a

which neither team was able to
break away to a commanding lead.
The tide only began to turn in favor

Women Beat Monmouth,

Bow, t 3H

by Mike Marcketti

Last week marked the most
varied display of talents yet this
season by the Grinnell Women’s
basketball team, as numerous in-
dividuals had fine performances
during the two conference games.
The Pioneers second conference
win was achieved Saturday in a
thrilling chess triumph over Mon-V
mouth while Tuesday’s game
against Knox saw Grinnell drop a
hardviought 83-66 decision by lets
ting things get away from them at
the end. Both games saw the
Pioneers continue their torrid
streak of shooting around 50 per'
cent; however, the difference was
in the ability to rebound and handle
pressure deicnse. Grinnell
demonstrated these qualities
against Monmouth, yet lacked
them severely against Knox.

ln Saturday’s victory, a large
turnout was treated to a downright
barn-burner. Both squads struggle
ed tenaciously for control of the
game, but neither could gain it as
Grinnell’s 26-23 halftime lead was
nearly the biggest margin of the
first period. Darby's throng watch-
ed from the edge or their bleachers
as Monmouth surged into a 3:732
lead early in the second half. The
last 15 minutes were quite en-
joyahle, however, as the Pioneers
fastrhreaked (quite eilectivelyl t to
a 5347 lead and coasted home the
rest of the way. Very special credit
for this victory goes to Amy
Johnson, with relief from Lisa
Giersbach‘, and Becky Rate. Amy
and Lisa played inryour-pocket
defense on the conference's second
leading scorer, l-leather Robert
son, limiting her to four points,
which was 20 fewer than her
average. Meanwhile, Becky hit
four shots from long range in the
second half, each one seemingly
more Crucial and from farther
away than the last, This outside
threat opened up the middle for the
conference's leading scorer. Laura

points, Lauri: also led the Pioneers
with 10 rebounds and six blocked
shots, while Jessica Toft guided
the team to an awesome 20 assists.
Grinnell’s fieldegoal percentage
tor the game was 52 percent, while
their defense continued its ex-
cellent play by limiting the Scots to
31 percent. _

For the tirst 'time in many
games, the defense failed in Tues-
day's game at Darby as the
Pioneers were simply outhustled
the last 20 minutes alter a scrappy
initial period that saw them head
to the locker room trailing scantly,
33-37. Knox out-rebounded the
Pioneers 40730 and shot 54 percent
(70 percent in the second half) as a
result of their aggressive second-
half play. Elizabeth Mchmsey,
Shannon Carr, and VanSickle ens
joyed strong offensive games
despite the defeat. Mchmsey con-
nected on six of eight shots on her
way to netting l5 points and core
railing ll) boards. Carr carried the
outside shooting load and hit all six
of her free shots on her way to 20
points, while Laura scored is
despite being double-teamed dur-
ing each possession. Behind the
shooting or this trio, Grinnell again
was very successlul on the alien
sive end of the court, shooting 47
percent for the game, However.
Knox was able to force too many
Pioneer errors with their full~court
press. and good shooting wasn’t
enough this time,

After going to lcwa Wesleyan
tonight and winning, the Pioneers
will return to Darby Tuesday at 7
pm. for a match against Clarke
College and a chance to finish the
season with 574 record over their
last nine games alter starting all
1711. This night will also mark the
last games for seniors Carr, Mc»
Jimsey. and Rate, and there would
be no better W to celebrate the
occasion than a ory in Darby in
{rent or a screaming crowd giving
them a winning mark in their last
nine collegiate games.
