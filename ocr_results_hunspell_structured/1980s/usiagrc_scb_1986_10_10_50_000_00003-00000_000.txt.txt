German
Asst. :

‘Twist of fate’

By Marty Myszcwski

The German assistant this year is Karin
Leupp. She comes to Grinnell from her
home town of Herisau in Appenzell, a can-
ton in northeastern Switzerland. This past
year she completed her educaton as a
teacher for children 7-12 years old and is
certified to teach in Switzerland. After
completing her education, she decided that
she did not want to teach, at least at that
time in her life. She decided to study fur»
ther and do some traveling. This is her
first time across the Atlantic and to date
the longest she has been away from home.

Every Grinnellian has been asked at
least once. “Why Grinnell?" Given the
geographic differences between Iowa and
Switzerland, I expected Karin's answer to
be markedly different from the usual
“good academics". “no frats" and “small
liberal arts college". Indeed it was. She
ended up here by a “twist of fate". In
Switzerland she applied [or an Amity
Scholarship for study in the United Stata.
The program was a kind of black box; she
sent the application in and later was in-
formed that she was going to Grinnell Col~
lege in Iowa. The details of the decision
were and are a mystery.

On the ﬂight to Des Moines. she sat next
to an Iowa native, who assured her that
contrary to popular beliei, lowa was not
flat, but hilly. A glance out the window

With the newly-revived interest in the
Grinnell in China study abroad program, it
would seem appropriate that some light
should be shed on the present visiting
Chinese professor to Grinnell College.

Professor Zengtong Xu received her
degree from Fudan University in
Shanghai. China. Contrary to the popular
belief that females are considered inferior
to males and discriminated against in
China, Xu maintains that females in China
have the same opportunity of receiving
higher education as their male counter
parts. This is due to the fact that, as in
America one has to sit for a college en-
trance exam in order to enter into a
university

Xu was chosen by her department to
come over to the United States due to her
fluency in Chinese and English. Site was
assigned to Beloit College in Wisconsin
with five other students from China as part
of the study abroad program between
China and the United States.

Presently. she is intermittently
attending fine arts classes. She firmly
believes that a liberalrarts education
develops an individual into a well»rounded
person.

When she first came to this country. she
was prepared to face any cultural shocks.
as she had armed herself with information
concerning life in the United States
through books and the media. As fate
would have it, she found herself in a small
rural town which was a far cry from the
teeming cosmopolitan city of Shanghai,
where she was formerly living. Xu found
Beloit peaceful though Small. The quality
that most impressed her was the

closed the debate, Iowa was big and flat
Aside from the insides of airports and
views from 30,000 feet, Iowa is all of
America that she has seen in person, Over
Fall Break she plans to go to Chicago and
later in the year to Mexico. California,
New York and perhaps D.C and see all the
things that a European tourist “has to see
in America"

Her academics this semester consist of
American History and drawing and her
responsibilites as the German language
assistant are running conversation sec»
tions for the 101 and 221 courses. In addi»
tion. she attends German Table weekly
and is available (or casual conversation.
She can be found occasionally at French
Table. as she speaks that language as well.

friendliness of the community. When com-
plete strangers greeted her. she felt as if
everyone was a friend. These minor but
significant gestures helped lusen her
discomfort in an unfamiliar situation. she
felt. As a result. she had little difficulty in
adjusting to American life.

Xu finds Grinnell College to be a sound
liberal arts college with good library and
computer facilities, Furthermore. she is
impressed with the detailed attention paid
to academic quality by the iaculty and the
administration alike.

Besides having knowledge of English
and Chinese, Xu has previously studied
Russian, French and Japanese,

Though she was once proficient enough
in Russian to translate a whole novel, she
has now virtually forgotten how to Colin
verse in that language through lack oi
practice. AS a result of that, she now ad-
vises her students to be constant in their
approach to a new language. She contends
that while the theoretical side of a
language course is important, the prac-
tical side should be emphasized as it is
harder to attain and even easier to forget.

After her term at Grinnell College, Xu
intends to return to her homeland as she is
eager to expose her newly~acquired
knowledge and opinions to her students.

As for how she would like to be
remembered Xu Said. “I want to he a good
teacher, a sincere friend, and a conscien-
tious learner.”

I had been told that his

name was Guillaume, but when I looked up

the French Assistant in the student direc-

tory, 1 found a Dominique Bourrier,

l dialed the number. willing to interview

either one of them. They did turn out to be

one and the same person. His name is

Dominique Guillaume Bourrier.

Q: what is your name?

A: Guillaume

Q: What is your quest?

A: To return to France with a good
American accent.

Q: What is your favorite color?

A: Green, No, black.

Black is easy to wear. There‘s something
magic in black. It's magnetic. It's amaz-
ing. This winter I will be dressed in black, I
will look like a raven.

Q: What do you think about Grinnell?

A. Its an interesting experiment a good
experiment for me. but I often feel too con-
fined here. almost Cut—off from much of
what is happening in other places, There is
sometimes a need to escape, But I like the
way this campus works and I enjoy being a
part of it. Many times. though, it seems
like people are too superficial . . . i want to
get to know people more deeply, That is
important to me,

Q: What kind of people would you like to
get to know?

A: Creative, interesting people. Like
painters or people that do things with their
hands. I don’t like people that just nod
their heads and Say “yes". I want people to
discuss things with . . some good conver-
sation

o: Europeans most likely have
stereotypes of Americnas. After you arriv-
ed, which ones were substaniated and
which were not?

A: American openness. I though they were
more open. Many are so wrapped up in
their own lives that they don’t extend
themselves. Well. that’s hard to
generalize. I’ve met both kinds oi people;
outgoing and Self-centered. i had a
stereotype of the Midwest. l thought the
Midwest was full of average Americans
and l was a littlescared to come here. But
I had heard Grinnell had a good mixture of
people irom across the country and that
was good.

Q: If you could be any kind oi animal, what
would it be and why?

A. A dog A hunting dog. Mostly because of
fidelity Actually I m not very faithful, but
yes, a hunting dog.

9- what do you miss about home?

A. I miss the cultural life of Paris; the
films. lectures, concerts parties, that
there was always Something to do. I miss
the b cit life.
