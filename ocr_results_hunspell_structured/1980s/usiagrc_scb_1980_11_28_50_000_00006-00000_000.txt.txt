Mease at ll a.m., Dec, 4, in Roberts
Theater. The speech is entitled
“Laughing Wild Amid Severest Woe:
Beckett’s Comedyi" Mease. an instruc-
tor in the drama department. said she
will use the lecture to "introduce
students to Samuel Beckett and his
mind."

Mease described Ireland-born
Beckett as “a major playwright oi the
20th century with an Irish sense of
humor and a grim French

metaphysical viewpoint." A sampling
of Beckett's works was performed ’by
Grinnell students Octl 11 and 12 and in-
cluded the play, Endgame. Nell, a
character in this piece, speaks a line
that is the basis for Beckett’s comedy.
“Nothing's funnier than unhappiness,"
Nell says, and Beckett employs
characters who somehow manage to re-
tain their humor in the midst of the
worst conditions of humanity to prove
this point.

” “Earth is hell' is another point
Beckett stresses,” Said Mease. “And

pain and suffering run throughout his
works,” This suffering is not seen only
on the stage when a Beckett work is
performed, for the audience can also
[eel that the work is "irreverant and
hlasphemous on its sharp edge. His wit
outs right to the bone," Mease stated.

Mease hopes that the Convocation au-
dience will realize, as Beckett does,
that “As long as you can laugh at
yourself, you‘re still alive. This is a
mark of maturity.” She also intends to
demonstrate the idea “We can't go
around looking at the world through
rose-tinted glasses" by telling some of
her favorite “grim" Beckett jokes,

Executive VicesPresident Waldo
Walker asked Mease at the-beginning or
the semester to give the Dec. 4 lecture.
She has been considering this topic for
several months and feels the talk will
be especially appropriate lorthis time
at the year. “Beckett has themost
wonderful corrective to Christmas
spirit," she explained. "He says we
decay and there isn‘t any hope oi
redemption. We can laugh at the poor
joke the creator has played on us."
Mease stressed, “This Way of counter
ing the Christmas spirit is not glurn,
destructive, or mentally ill. It helps us
preserve our sanity."

Beckett's philosophies may also help
counter the spirit of the Grinnell camv
pus. For. with Finals beginning the
iollowmg week, "Laughing Wild Amid
severest Woe" could be the best advice
to.follow to survive the test of the
semester.
