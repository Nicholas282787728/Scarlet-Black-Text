ships Monday by the J.N. “Ding" Darling Foundation to help defray the costs of their

oLaundry facilities tight

The smrt oi Loose Hall renovation this week not only moves 100 Gates and Rawson
residents onto north campus but also leaves the remaining 300 south campus residents
with only [our washers and tour dryers for their laundry. Nearly one-third of the cam-
pus laundry iacilities have been lost to students because Loose contained nine washers
and seven dryers out or the campus total oi 21 and 20, respectively,

“People in south campus have it good compared on people in north," said Jim reder
man, dean of Student Ailairs. He noted that the iacrlities in Main Hall will serve 300
students while more than 600 students will have the use of only eight washers and nine
dryers total between both Younkers and Dihble on north campus. This problem should
be alleviated with an addition to the Younkers' two washers and two dryers which
Tederman hopes can be made over winter break.

About one-third more machines will be added to Loose’s previous capacity when the
worlr there is completed. Tederman expects to increase the number in Dibble when that
dorm is renovated.

O Griswold surveys‘students

Health Center Supervisor Andrea Griswold has devised a survey of the facility‘s uses
which was distributed to all students Thursday, The purpose of the survey, she
reported, is to “plan the program tor next year and justiiy to the administration the in»
creasing of services.”

It is intended to be a “needs assessment," said Griswold. She hopes to learn what
services students would like to add to the Health Center’s capabilities, it they would
like increased stalf supervision on the weekends and whether they would be willing to
pay an estimated $10 to Sit: more than the current 535 Health Center tee to provide [or
these additions,

Griswold asked that all students complete the forms honestly and return mem to the
RAs, This input is important, she stated, because “I anticipate the administration will
pay more attention [to proposed changes] il l have more student support behind me.”
