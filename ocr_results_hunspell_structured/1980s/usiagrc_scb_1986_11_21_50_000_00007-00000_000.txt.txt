Nostalgic View. of Activism Criticized

Dear Editor:

I agree that this campus is becoming
apathetic and lazy in its political beliefs.
There is no better indication of this apathy

than the lack of active support for divest~ -

ment. I do not. however, agree with with
the nostalgic view of activism 2 years ago.

The article. ”Students lazy in defense of
divestment”, calls for true moral commit-
ment on the part of the students. As a
member of Students to End Apartheid, I
am also looking for that type of commit
ment in ”200 students stretched from
Gardner Lounge to Burling Library.”
There I only see a “trendy display of con-
cern.”

I also doubt the students were successful
in forcing the Trustees to consider divest-
ment as a moral imperative. If the
Trustees had been overcome by the moral
imperative to divest the college would
have a full divestment policy — not a par-
iial divestment policy full of loopholes.

Moral decisions are absolute, the
Trustees‘ decision was merely pragmatic.

, What the Trustees saw 2 years ago was not
200 morally Committed students but 200
potentially dangerous students.
Dangerous not only to the Trustees
themselves but also to the public image of
the college. The protest was very suc-
cessful in the short term. but without long
term commitment from the students. it

beocmes meaningless. The Trustees
Resolution was not an attempt to end the
apartheid system, rather an attempt to
placate the student body. Unfortunately,
that attempt appears to have been suc
cessful.

Moreover, the Resolution is done by
students. The recommendation process in
cludes continual correspondence with the
companies involved ill South Africa. out-
side research, and reading reports on com~
panies. This information is then evaluated
and recommendations are made to the
Trustea. After hours of work last year, one
iy $5.340 were divested out of the nearly 4
million dollars recommended. After hav-
ing focused the group‘s energy on divests
merit all last year and getting so little in
return many oi the students returning
from last year are unwilling to commit
themselves to a policy which they feel says
and does nothing. The inactivity of SEA
this semester does not reflect a lack of
commitment towards divestment; it

reflects a lack of faith in the Trustees and ?

their Resolution

The easiest way to assume the guise of
political concern is to criticize the?»
organization of political groups on cam»
pus SEA does. beyond a doubt have its
problems. but if you are truly concerned
come to our meetings and help us over-
come them. 7 Carol Pilgrim

SGA Treasurer Suggests
KDIC Budget Cut

To the Editor:

This letter is written in response to Andy
Poland's letter of last week. As this year's
Student Government Association
Treasurer. the problem of the stolen
records Irom KDIC is also a concern for
me. Since I oversee the spending of student
fun‘ds (along with the Committee on Stu-
dent Publications and Radio. in this case)
this issue has come to my attention.

Every semestei we spend literally hun-
dreds oI dollars on new records for KDIC.
In addition. the radio station receives free
records from companies, The KDIC staff
is trying to build its record collection so
that it can provide better programming to
the entire student body. Many people can
benefit from one record in this way.

Unfortunately. some of the money the

KDIC staff spends every semester is used
to replace stolen records It’s dishearten-
ing to hear DJ‘s say that a popular record
is back at the radio station because we
bought another copy it isn‘t KDIC's or
SGA'S purpose to enrich individual slu~
dent's record collections 1 know people on
my floor who have KDIC records. and one
actually told me that he had a right to the
records because he paid his lees. Such selfr
centered greediness. I feel, is out of place
at Grinnell

Just remember that everyone pays for
the records that a few people are now get-
ting enjoyment from Unless some securi-
ty system can be implemented, or the
record thefts stop stealing I think that it is
a poor use oi student funds to buy new
records for KDIC. 7 Kai in Nyhus ‘87

This past Wednesday. November 19,
your Joint Board senators effectively said
that it is not their role to represent the opir
nions of the student body. Although the
SGA Constitution clearly states that the
duties and responsibilities of a senator in-
clude “ascertaining and reporting to the
Joint Board [the] opinion of their consti»
tuents." at Wednesday’s meeting. they
denied that they had any responsibility to
take a stand on campus issues in the name
of the students they "represent."

The specific issue involved was a letter
to George Drake, concerning acts of
homophobia on campus, that i had brought
before Joint Board for their approval. The
disagreeable part oi my letter was where l
stated that I was sending the letter “as a
representative of the student body.” My
rationale for this Statement was: I) I was
elected by a majority vote of the student
body to represent the Student Govern-

ment 2) The Senators of the Student
% Government were elected by a majority of
§ their constituents. The senators had a copy
it of the letter for one full week in which to
éé ascertain the feelings of their constituency
,1 concerning the letter. Assuming that each
4, senator did his/her duty and knew the sen
timents of their constituents. a simple vote
fr should have told us whether or not the stu»

dent body agreed Approval by the

s "astudents in the dorms allows for the ap»
:32 proval of the senators. which allows me to
e speak. on that specific occasion. as a
it representative of the student body.

lnstead the proposal that finally passed
a over my strong objections. was sent' in the
g? name of “the majority of the members of
g; Joint board" They make no claim to be

themselves: sixteen people who somehow

came across the position of Joint Board
senator and are now making a statement.

The students of this campus need to
make their feelings known. The path that
SGA is on now is that of a financial rubber
stamp. We decide who can have money for
this party or that group. We make no
_statements concerning campus issues of
the slightest political nature. We merely
speak for ourselves: Twentyvseven people
who connect you into giving us titles like
senator and President,

The alternative, as I see it. is an SGA
that is truly representative. if our senators
were to perform their duties to the fullest
extent 7 actively representing the people
they are supposed to s then we could have

" ‘an SGA that Could stand up and speak out

for what we. the students of GrinneII Col~
lege, believe in,»I know that there is a lot of
diversity on campus. and I do not seek to
wash over that I think there is also a lot of
consensus.

If the senators had gone to their constis
tuents. and then come back and said “My
dorm disagrees with what this letter says,
so don't send it,” that would have been
alright. The students would have been
represented. But at least half didn't even
ask! They just thought about it themselves
and decided what they thought was best.
These same peoplerwho told you at the
beginning of the year that they would
“represent" their dorm and “seek out'
your opinion

A lot of you are being cheated out of an
effective student government by the pear
pie you elected to represent you to'that
government. Don't stand for it} Demand
your right to representation, or don't come
plain about the consequences when nobody
is represented other than the people you

' elected.

Health Center Pelicy Blasted

Dear Editor,

I’m sure someone has written a letter
along these lines earlier this year. but I'm
going to write another The subyect is the
Health Center and its services. or the lack
thereof. The administration may find it
convenient to have it closed on the
weekends. but I for one. do not

Oil Saturday morning. I fell down the
stairs and severely sprained my ankle.
Afraid that I may have broken something,
my floormates took me to the hospital for
xerays. Luckily nothing was broken. but it
is very sore and I Was told the usual (keep
it wrapped. elevated, etc.) and that it
would be a good idea to get some crutches
for a few days. The hospital. however.
couldn’t give me the crutches — I was sup-
posed to get them at the Health Center.
But. of couise. the Health Center Wasn't

open, so i had to forgo crutches until at
least Monday.

Since I couldn't walk. [asked my roomr
mate to get me a sick meal for dinner.
When she returned. she told me that food
service wasn't going to give her the meal
because I hadn't been to the Health Center.
My roommate very patiently explained
that this was impossible as the Health
Centervis closed on weekends. and they.
finally gave in.

As funny as this whole situation sounds.
it really is a problem. If neither the
hospital nor the Health Center can meet
our needs. then what else are the students
supposed to do? As for meals, I guess we
will all have to stop getting sick and falling
down stairs between 6:00 pm. Friday and
8:00 a.m. Mondays.

Draus Defends “Sexist” Column

by Paul Draus

“book, there goes that freshman sexist
pig

I have been hearing that and similar
smtements whispered behind my back for

the past two weeks, by women and'men I .

didn't even know. It didn't matter whether
or not those things were actually being
Said, I heard them nonetheless.

l have snuck past groups of chattering
students. my head hung low, eyes staring
down at my shufﬂing feet, trying to
become one with the shadows. It didn't
help. Istill kept hearing it: “Isn‘t that him.
the sexist swine?"

I have walked into the dining halls, with
their glaring ﬂourescent lights. feeling
naked and exposed. and I have seen eyes
looking up and condemning me before I
could utter a word in my defense. As I
removed my hands from my lace to pick
up my tray, 1 have felt those same eyes as
if they were a red~hot brand, thrusting for-
ward and searing one painful Sinlettel'
word into the skin of my forehead: SEX-
IST.

I stand accused.

I have many friends. here at Grinnell, at
home in Illinois, in other parts of the CDuI‘r
try. even in other countries, who are
women. I have a mother who works and a
little sister who scored better on the SAT
than I did, i have been going to school and
competing with girls on an equal basis
since grade school, when they were girls,
through this. my freshman year in college.
when they are women.

I have never thought twice about that.

Last summer I worked two different
jobs. At both the restaurants where I
Waited tables. my boss was a woman. I lik-
ed and respected both.

I have never thought twice about that.

Two weeks ago I wrote my first column
for this newspaper. It was about, among
other things. an eighteenryearrold boy who
has this thing about looking at attractive
females. In the article, I used terms such
as “,sleek gorgeous co eds”, “muscular.
attractive bodies.‘ and' pretty girls in
sweatpants " I thought I was being fairly
accurate in my descriptions, and I thought
my choice of words was rather none
offensive. considering I could have used

much ‘stronger phrases. like “hot chicks"
or “Iucious babes."

The boy in the article was me. I do have
this thing about looking at pretty women, I
always have. I Watched Wonder Woman. I
watched Charlie's Angels. I've looked at
Playboy magazine. I've even watched a
Miss America pageant or two.

I have never thought twice about that.

Perhaps I should have. For the week
after I wrote that column, which to me was
a simple, harmless story bout an eighteens
yearrold American male doing things that
most eighteenryearnld American males
do. i started hearing it. i heard it
everywhere. it was whispered in the trees
as l walked to class. it was shouted across

.the cafeteria behind my back. it was even
vocalized by a friend of mine at lunch one
day. And then last week, the proverbial ex»
crement hit the fan There it was in the
newspaper. a steaming mad public Con-
demnation. practically setting the entire
editorial page on fire in its anger, and
above it was the headline. in bitter cold
black and white: “Draus column sexist."
’ My fears had been realized

i was coniused somewhat dazed by the

letters animosity. i asked someone ta
woman) exactly what sexism was in her
opinion. justso i could be sure or just what
it was that I was being accused 01.1 was
told this: “Sexism is when someone views
or treats a member of the opposite sex as
an object."

According to that delintiion. I probably
am a sexist. because I just don‘t think it's
wrong for a man to view a woman or a
woman a man, as an object of affection.
admiration or even desire. What else are
humans going to focus their affections on.
trees?) I agree that to treat someone sole-
ly as an object of sex or to discriminate
against them on that basis IS wrong. and I
hope that I would never do such a thing.
But I don't think that admiring a member
of the opposite sex for purely physical
reasons is wrong.

If people weren I meant to feel sexual
desires we would reproduce by budding;
we dont. obviously. at least not to my
knowledge When I wrote that column two
weeks ago, l didnt stop to think about
whether or not the feelinac 1 was express.
