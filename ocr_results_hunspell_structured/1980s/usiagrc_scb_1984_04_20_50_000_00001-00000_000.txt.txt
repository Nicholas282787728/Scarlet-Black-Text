Relays are coming

by Brian Broderick

The Grinnell Relays Committee
met in the Forum Monday night to
tie up loose ends in this Olympic
Year's Relays.

Among the loose ends ior
Relays weekend were Dave Mc-
Connell’s paying tor the Saturday
picnic. Jel'ome-on-the-Sti‘eet play-
ing in the Pub on Friday Happy
Hour and the lack at a toilet to ex-
plode.

The 1984 Relays. which Pres
lessor oi Political Science l-l
Wayne Moyer assured will be non
political. oiiicially begins with
Caesarean Sexion opening ior
Jonathon Richmond and the
Modern Lovers on Friday night,

The Titular Head talent show in
Gardner Lounge will follow the
concert at 10 p.m.. with Neil Boris
and Andy Gross emceeing.

The Titular Head. which Moycr
calls “the antithesis of the
homecoming queen.” will be a
"figure to preside over the
Relays." Moyer added that ”a
very distinguished group of
judges pick the Titular Head. who
rides the Budweiser truck as a
sign oi importance.”

Moyer insisted that the Titular
Head “is a spoof: we want to bring
back the satire to Grinnell”. as ops
posed to what he and senior Pete
Biesada agreed upon as a decline
in recent years of the show's
quality.

The official movie for Relays
will be the Marx Brothers'

“Horsel‘ealhers” on Friday at
midnight,

Saturday morning will begin
bright and early with the Bloody
Mary and Bagel Breakfast in
Younkers lounge. The committee
couldn’t afford to buy balloons. so
students are encouragd to bring
balloons (or similarly shaped ob-
jectsl to the Breakiast.

The Breakfast will be inter-
rupted by the Relays parade.
which will be led by the musical
group More Casserole and will "1'
clude floats from the dorms.

The parade will end in
MacEachron Field, where the
games will commence Among the
activities planned are the
Milwaukee Beverage Relay
twhich Moyer calls the “core oi
the Relays"), the Babe Ruth Bat
Relay. and a pie~ealmg contest
Moyer Stressed that "style is what
counts; this is a test of none
academic skills and form is more
important than contest"

The origin oi the relays. which
has been publicized recently by
yellow ilyers in the campus dining
halls. was a partially politically
motivated one.

Late in the April of 1973. Moyer
and two students met outside
Burling Library and decided to
relax. In Mayer's words “there
were no Vietnam war demonstr
tions. and things were really i
tense. The SGA liked the idea and
organized it in a week with just
three kegs of beer."

The rest is history

JB votes down
McLean Proposal

by M. Woiigang Schumann
“This would indeed be a lands
7 ‘mark in history — the first time a
government voted to limit its own
power!” So said Ian McLean on
behali oi his proposed resolution
to alter drastically the represenr
tative process oi Joint Board.

The resolution was defeated
soundly by a voice vote. It would
have provided a system under
which hall presidents and offs
campus representatives would
have had to conduct a binding poll
of their constituents before voting
on any national or international
issue.

McLean claimed mat the pass-
ing oi his proposal would increase
the credibility of the student
government and would prevent
Board members irom being
elected for their political beliefs.
because they would not be iree to
vote their own opinion on political
issues.

Under the system. as revised by
McLean's own amendment,
representatives would be required
to give notice oi pending political
questions and to post three
envelopes. marked “APPROV
ED." “OPPOSED.” and “ABS-
TAIN.” into which students could
cast their votes The represen-
tatives must then vote according
to the wishes of their constituents
as expressed by the vote, “It's
wordy but it’s not complicated."
McLean explained.

The measure was defeated less
for its intention than for its
speciiic content. some Joint
Board members contended that a
referendum on each issue would
be practical and even more

representative than McLean's
plan,

Robin Hartung. the SGA's Ad»
ministrative Assistant and Elec-
tion Board Chair. said the only ap-
parent problem with such a
referendum system would be the
printing oi over one thousand
ballots each time a question came
about,

Ethan Cohen. an oil-campus
representative. said that he didn’t
trust the students enough to abide
by such an arrangement Cohen
mentioned the possibility that so
meone could tamper with polling
envelopes. “Sometimes I can’t
even trust myself." he said.
“What if I’m that deranged?”

OffrCampus President Matt
Golden also commented that
McLean’s proposal would be like
the Electoral College in that a
bare majority in one hall would be
worth exactly as much as an over
whelming majority in another,

with these objections. the
resolution did not pass. McLean.
however. raised the possibility
that he would welcome a different
plan based on the same idea of ms
creasing the representation oi
Joint Board on political issues. It
seems likely that a new proposal.
possibly tor a standing referen-
dum provision. will be presented
before the end of the semester.

The Board also discussed and
passed a memo written by Loose
Hall President Ellen Brooke that
supports “the principles and
methods of affirmative action as
they are deiined in the “Grinnell
College Affirmative Action
Guidelines' " and the “search for

Amendment process for
Parslow Proposal continues

by Jane Kauiman

Discussions of the Parslow Pro-
posal again dominated Monday's
iaculty meeting. Much oi the
debate was centered around
amendments combining many at
the policy changes suggested in
the Jones Proposal and sugges-
tions of Catherine Frazier. dean of
iaculty.

A proposed amendment to
delete the ioreign language re-
quirement by proiessor oi
Mathematics. Charles .lepsen.
failed after discussion. Two
amendments were passed which
change the nature at the
Humanities and Social Studies re,
quirements in the Parslow Pro
posal. These amendments
parallel an amendment to the

Parslow proposal passed at the

eight credits oi science. including
iour credits in laboratory courses.

The Social Studies requirement
now reads. “Eight credits in
Social Studies courses approved
by the Social Studies Division and
Curriculum Committee with the
additional restriction that four
credits [be in interdisciplinary
speCIflcally designed 200 level
coursesl.“

The Humanities requirement
stipulates an eight credit
minimum with a iour credit prer
modern and a four credit modern
requirement. derived from a list
oi courses “approved by the
Humanities Division and Curr
riculum Committee.”

Jepsen presented the amend-
ment to delete the foreign
language requirement because.
he said. “I thought that this was
an issue the iaculty wanted to
discuss." especially as it related
to “staffing implications."

Dennis Haas. professor of
religious studies. expressed con»
cern about the effect of such a re-
quirement in relation to admis-
sions He voiced concern about the
diiiiculty in completing the re-
quirement ior some students.
However, he also admitted that
“This Will create a gap.” But. he
contended that a gap exists in
Noanestern Studies.

Salary cut prompts resignation

by Jeffrey Raymond

Although Grinnell College's
Sloan Grant proposes an expand-
ed Math Lab. the position of direc-
tor of the Math Lab is being reduCr
ed to a hali‘rtimc job and Elke
Bellile. the current director. has
resigned rather than accept a cut
in salary.

on page eight oi the Sloan pro-
posal is the statement: ”An ex-
panded Mathematics Laboratory
is needed. . . The addition oi a se~
cond iull-time person. with train-
ing in the physical sciences. com
puting. or statistics. would be
needed to handle the increased de
mand ior individual help in
problem-solving courses,"

Dean oi the Faculty Catherine
Frazer said oi the statement.
“That certainly was a hope and a
plan when we were doing the tpro-
poSaIl.” She said that she had to
make cuts in her department and
the “purely administrative" iunc-
tion oi the director makes it a
position that could be reduced.

“It was my judgement that
(reducing the position) was less
costly than other areas I had
responsibility for.” said Frazer.
“I think it will have less effect
than any oi the other options
available to me. She said that use

oi the Lab has doubled since
Bellile took over as director in
1980. but that the Lab is serving
primarily ior remedial help in
lower level classes,

Student assistants in the Lab
will have to adjust to the new
situation. but Frazer. when asked
whether she ielt they could do a
suiiicient job. said. “i have every
reason to think so "

Bellile. however. said
“Because of the small size of
Grinnell College. we have a
limited amount of student
assistants who are exceptionally
good, Also, they are full-time
students. So that presents a pro
blem.”

in her letter oi resignation
dated April 1. Bellile wrote. “I
personally ieel that the decision to
make this position part-time is a
step backwards for Grinnell Cola
lege."

President George Drake said
that since the proposal was writ
ten two years ago, the administrar
tion’s View of the functions of the
Lab has changed and the College
is currently under financial
restraints resulting irom an
enrollment decline. “Whenever
you write a proposal tor a grant,"

said Drake. “there's an awful lot '

oi speculation written in."
“In general terms. we’re not
backing down on our commitment
to provide college support ior the
terms oi the grant We're doing a
lot to meet that commitment."
Echoing Drake. Frazer said. “I
think we can point to diiierent
areas where we are making up ior
it." She said that she did not ex»
pect any diiiiculties explaining
the decision to the Sloan Founda»
tion. which provided the grant.
”If they're convinced that we're
not being arbitrary. they won't
mind. It's a shift in direction in
that particular piece. and that‘s a
small part of the whole thing."
Bellile said that the provisions
of the new director’s position
make it impossible for her to hold
that job and iind other partrtime
work because it calls for the direc-
tor to work mornings on some
days and aiternoons on others. '
Referring to the College's Ai‘ii
mative Action policy. Bellile said.
”I think that if they have a
qualified female professional.
they should hold on to her,”
Frazer. however. said she was
not too concerned that a woman
was leaving because the hiring
problem was with faculty and the
director's job was part of the ad»
ministrative stair.
