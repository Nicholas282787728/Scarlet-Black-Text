Field hockey defeats Iowa Wesleyan 3-1

Depth and balance turn the team around

by Ellen Piekalkiewicz

The Grinnell College held hockey team,
boasting a perfect record due to their llex-
ibility and depth, defeated Iowa Wesleyan
3-1 last Saturday,

In the first haliof the game, the Pioneers
dominated with a strong offense, All of
Grinnell's goals were made in the first
half.

The first two goals were scored on penal-
ty corners. in both instances forward Val
Mauck passed the ball to link Kathy
Cullen, who then went on to score.

Later in the first half, forward Danielle
Walker got a break away down the ﬁeld
and scored Grinnell's third goal, making it
a 3 to 0 game.

“In the second half, the whole team fell
apart — defense as well as offense broke
down,” Captain Val Mauck said. When
asked what caused the break down she ex-
plained, “It was a hot day."

Despite the suggested breakdown of the
team, Grinnell held strong and allowed
Iowa Wesleyan merely one goal. The
Pioneers managed to maintain their lead
oi 3 to 1, and came away with their third
victory,

Victories for Grinnell teams are a rare
phenomenon. This year is no exception 7
the women’s field hockey team is the only
Grinnell team that can revel in glory. It is
the only team that remains undefeated.

The two captains, Val Mauck and Kathy
Cullen, attribute their winning streak to
the good attitude of the team.

“We never go into a game thinking we
are going to lose," Kathy Cullen said, “and
we never give up during a game." She add-
ed, “We have team spirit and determina-
tion.”

Cullen explained that this is a new mind
set for the team. Last year, she said, dur-
ing games “the team would sometimes
just give up when the omer team scored."

Captain Val Mauck stressed that she is
impressed wim uie players this year
because they are extremely committed to
doing the best job. She said, “People
always work hard in the game as well as in
practice.” She added that players are
always staying late after practice and go-
ing to talk to Coach Schweitzer on their
own time.

Mauck said this year's team also is more
balanced than last year's because this
year it has a good combination of play
The team, she said. has immense ﬂex
ty and depth.

There are seven returning players on the
team, plus several transfer students, leav-
ing room for only one starting freshman,
Paula Powell.

However, it is a young team. There are
only two seniors on the team so, as Cullen
puts it, “The Grinnell field hockey team
has a good future.”

in_addition, both captains give a lot of
credit to Coach Cathie Schweitzer, who
emphasizes committment to the team.

Coach Schweitzer said she expects her .

players to regard academics as top priorir
ty, field hockey second, and social lives
third. She said a lot of the players' social
interaction “comes from the team during
practice, road trips, and games."

Schweitzer said she gives many pep
talks, at which time the team discusses
past mistakes in games, and the upcoming
challenge of the next game.

During these pep talks, Schweitzer said,
she tries to make the players realize that
they are “capable of playing good field
hockey."

The Pioneer’s true test 01 strength will
come when they play in a tournament at
Carleton this weekend. There they will be
laced with tough competition not only on
the Division III level, but on the Division I
and 11 level as well.

Schweitzer said, however, that even
“defeat, which is always possible, will not
hurt the team’s attitude." More than
anything,’she added, ”We want to play
Grinnell hockey." Grinnell hockey, she ex-
plained, IS ”good hockey" which involves
“thinking and team play,"

 

So you say you missed last week’s volleyball game? We liked this one so much, we
decided to run it again. For all of you who weren’t there, Grinnell lost, 15-5, 15-0,

Soccer hosts
tournament

by David Lilienslein

This weekend Grinnell College hosted a
soccer tournament that included such nar
tionally ranked teams as Colorado College
and Washington University. Also included
in the weekend lineup was Lake Forest
College.

In the first game of the tournament, the
Grinnell team played what many consider
to be their best game of the season, despite
losing 4“ to Colorado College. Colorado
College has been consistently ranked in the
national Top Ten, and some oi the Col-
orado players are United states Olympic
Team hopefuls. Previous to the tourna-
ment, Colorado beat Cornell College — a
team that Grinnell defeated 1-0 and last
year’s conference champs — 3—0.

In the second game of the tournament,
Washington University, spurred on by two
successtul penalty kicks, beat Lake Forest
3-2.

Grinnell's second game of the tourna-
ment was against Wash. U. Both teams
played an even, controlled game, and the
first score wasn’t until late in the second
hair, Then, a Grinnell deiensive error led
to a second Washington goal. This goal,
scored with less than twenty minutes left
in the game, took some of are fire out of
Grinnell, and continued Washington
pressure led to a second and final goal.

Like Colorado, Wash. U has a history of
serious, quality soccer. Both teams
generally play at a competitive level
higher than Grinnell does in its division
three status. This [all break, Grinnell will
play Brandeis University and Trinity Col»
lege teams similiar to Colorado and
Washington.

In the end, Colorado College won the
tournament and Washington University
was the runner»up.

In other soccer action: The Varsity team
improved their record to 3-3-2 by beating
Augastana College 2-0. Goals were scored
by Edward Olson and Billy Strean,

Tuesday, the JV soccer team completed
their second game of the season against
Vennard College With a 470 victory, This
second game was played on Grinnell’s
field, a field much larger than that of Van
nard. At home, the Grinnell team played
their own game of control and was very
successful against Vennard's fast break
style Grinnell's defense, with Steve
Costner in goal, effectively shutdown Venr
nard's oiienswe threats, while Gi'innell's
offense, led by Steve Nash's two goals
Brian Fitzgerald's one goal and Nick
Wright’s one goal, walked all over the Venr

nard goalie, Earlier in the season, the,

teams played to a 3-3 draw
