Fourth quarter surge propels
Monmouth past Grinnell 31-10

by Gordon Schreiber

Last Saturday, the upset-
minded Grinnell Pioneers put
forth a strong effort against the
Fighting Scots of Monmouth
before falling late in the game,
31-10. The game was high-
lighted by excellent defensive ef-
forts from both teams and a rash
of turnovers, ten altogether,

Monmouth was the ﬁrst to
put points on the board in the
first quarter with a 46 yard
touchdown pass over the Grinnell
secondary. The conversion put
Monmouth up 70. The Pioneers
came back on their next drive
with quarterback Jim Weiand
moving the offense 59 yards to
set up a 25 yard Mike Mohan
ﬁeld goal. The drive was keyed
by a 25 yard run by Paul
Manternach and 13 yard pass
from Weiand to Dave White

stingy defense but Monmouth
caught a break when they recovv
ered a fumble on the Grinnell 22
yard line. Unable to move the
ball they settled for a Paul
Warfield field goal, increasing
their lead to 10-3. Grinnell an—
swered by moving confidently
down the field. Weiand com-
pleted passes of 16 yards to
Many Hunsucker and 37 yards to
Sean O'Brien in the nine play
drive that was capped off by a 5
yard loss from Weiand to Ar-
mando Gilkesl Mohan's point
after evened the score at 10-10
going into halftime.

Neither team was able to
move the ball in the third quarter
due to outstanding defense and
turnovers which made for an ex-
citing and sloppy seesaw battle.
Monmouth finally broke the
deadlock in the fourth quarter
with a well engineered drive ﬁn—
ished by a five yard scoring
plunge, That drive seemed to

-‘open the gates as Monmouth
added two more scores in the ﬁnal
period, one on a 60 yard punt re-

turn and the other on a 34 yard
touchdown run in the final
minute of play.

Despite the loss, Coach
Wallace was pleased with the ef-
fort saying, "We played hard»
nosed football and went into the
fourth quarter with a chance to
win. The defense was particu-
larly outstanding." The defensive
charge was led by Mike Anderson
who led the team in tackles and
Wallace Squibb who had 8 1/2
tackles and recovered a fumble.
Bill Dabney also played well on
the defensive line, registering 3
tackles for losses and a sack, The
offense was led by Mantemach's
89 yards rushing and Weiand's
122 yards passing and one touch-
down.

Next week the Pioneers
wind up the season at Illinois
College in what is expected to be
a tough matchup. Last year,
Grinnell was able to top the Blue
Boys with a 21»20 come from
behind win that led to pushing
and shoving between the teams as
they shook hands after the game.

November 4, 1988

Take my wife,
Please!

by Bob Lifton

Trends are always interest-
ing to follow in sports. Be it
last year's controversy about the
baseball and the unsurmountable
number of home runs being hit,
or this year‘s dearth of quarter»
backs in the N.F.1.. »- how
many will leave on a stretcher
this week kind of thing. But
there‘s something else, albeit
smaller in "number," which is
more prevalent, or at least more
alarming, in this 1988 sports
year. In the Chinese calender, 1
think they might refer to '88 as
"The Year of the 'Wife."' ("Wife"
here is qualiﬁed so as to include
girlfriend)

Three cases immediately
come to mind: Janet Jones,
Bridgette Nielson and everyone‘s
favorite, Robin Givens. Each of
these young ladies has had a pro-
found effcct on the sports world --
all contributing their "talents" to
three different spons, just to be
democratic, I guess —- which
prompted my hypothesis that
hey, there‘s something going on
here (for lack of a more speciﬁc
theory).

The "trend" began with ac-
tress Janet Jones being bethrothcd
by Edmonton superstar Wayne
Gretzsky, arguably the greatest
man ever to play hockey Shortly
after the GreatrOne's marriage to
the blonde bombshell did he
make a sudden exit —- completely
taking the sperm world by sur-
prise —- from his beloved Edmon-
ton (which had been his home for
his 9—year pro career) to her home
in plush, anything—but—hockey»
country LA. Hmmm. Canada
without Gretzsky? That's like
Ben Johnson without steroids;
they just "go together,"

And so it went Canadians
everywhere began labeling Jones
as a franchise breaker, likening
her on many occasions to Yoko
Ono, who many blame for the
separation of the Beatles. The
verdict was out: she was evil,
Janet made Wayne leave; it's all

 

her fault.

While this messy situation
did get somewhat cleared-up in
the months to follow, with
Oiler's owner Peter Pocklington

taking the brunt of the blame for
shipping off the "franchise,"
thereby relieving Jones of the
villian role per se, there are more
than a couple skeptics still at
large who think otherwise. They
ﬁnd a clear correlation between
Jones and Gretzsky's departure,
and hence are proponents
(unknowingly) of my "theory."
For this rather large group, Jones
is not a welcome sight in Ed
monton, to say the least.
Gaining less media expo-
sure but nonetheless germain to

our theory is the relationship be-
tween actress Bridgette Nielsen
and NY. Jets' defensive end
Marc Gastineau. (Nielson repre-
sents the "girlfriend element“
which destroys a fun-fledged
"wife theory.") During an inter-
view at the halftime ofa Monday
Night Football telecast, the con-
troversial Jet sack specialist
claimed that he would give up

' anything for this six-foot model

who had previously been Mrs.
Sylvester Stallone. Well, well,
well!

No sooner said than done.
Before the following game.
Gastineau's threat/promise came
true. He unexpectantly retired
from football, calling his brief
career quits because his girlfriend
"reportedly" had cancer of the
cervix, By no means am I belit-
tIeIing a health problem. espe-
cially one as dangerous as cancer.
It's just an interesting
"phenomenon," that's all. Sim-
mer down.

The final and most
interesting part of this trend is
the over-publicized, problem—rid-
dled relationship between actress
Robin Givens and heavyweight
boxing champion Mike Tyson.
Virtually all the speciﬁcs from
their 8emonth long lurmoil»cen~
tered marriage are well-lo-town, or
at least should be, as not a week
went by without one of the major
tabloids carrying some spicy type
of gossip concerning the love
birds.

Butjust in case you missed
a day »- shortly after the now in»
famous 20/20 interview with
Barbara Walters, Givens ﬁled for
a divorce, Well surprise. sur~
prise! How the champ didn't see

that one mph. punch coming
I'll never comprehend.

in any event. it's’over.
Givens left, among "other
things," because "Michael" as she
so affectionatley called him, "beat
her." Sorry Robin, I have too
much trouble buying that one.
After witnessing what Tyson did
to power-packed athletes in under
three minutes. 1 find it hard to
believe that a frail Bryn Mawr
graduate would escape unscathed.
Nice try, though.

So what's the deal, you
impatiently ask? What does this
supposed "trend” tell us, if any—
thing? Are all women manipu-
lating and downright evil’.7 1-1ea7
vans no. Should malc profes-
sional athletes refrain from mar-
riage altogether to "save" their
careers? Of course not. So,
what‘s your big "solution," smart
ass? Good question. AllIknow
is that I'm forever thankful
Michael Jordan isn't man-led to an
actress.
