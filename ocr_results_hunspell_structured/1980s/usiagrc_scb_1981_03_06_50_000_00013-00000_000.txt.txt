This weekend a sizable number at
Grinnell students will be dancing up a
storm at the Loose Hall Ball, Yet should
you care to observe some dancmg {or a
change or just as a prelude to hitting
the dance floor yourself, you might
want to check out the Modern Dance
Troupe's presentation given this Friday
and Saturday at 8 p.m. in Roberts
Theatre, The program of 13 dancesc
mostly student-choreographed. should
provide an evening of novel entertain
ment for all who attend,

what exactly does one see at a
modern dance concert? Much mat will
seem familiar to aﬁcionados of ballet or
jazz dancing. The essential element oi
modern dance is not that it is merely a
conglomeration DI older styles but that
it is an original approach to tried-and»
true iorms. AS troupe leader Babe
Voertman put it, "What I look [or in my
students‘ work is something that l've
never seen belore. that they've never
done before, Dancers have many
elements or jazz and classical dancing
in their movement repertory but I en-
courage them to continually express
someﬂiing new while still using that
repertory. Sometimes these attempts
may not work yet there is still
something learned in the process. what
is essential to modern dance is that one
always be making an honest attempt at
formulating something new."

Voertman's dancers certainly are not
at a loss for ideas. of the 13 numbers in
this week‘s show only two were not
choreographed by students, "We had so
many suggestions {or dances that we've
decided to do another program later in
the semester." added Voertman, The
second presentation ior this year is
scheduled ior Sunday, April 26.

Troupe? Quite a variety or people

How do college students find the time
for so much dancing? Obviously,
dedication is extremely important but
what rewards do they gaini Claudia
Stone explained that [or her, "learning
to periorm is Just as important as learn-
ing to dance. You learn to take
criticism by putting yourself in die
vulnerable position oi having your work
evaluated publicly." As one of seven
students doing choreography for this
Show, Stone is "on trial" in a dual
capacity, "You must take chances
thoug at just rehash the works of
other she said. "For instance I'
usually work closely with the music but
this time I'm experimenting with a
style with very little beat to it.“ Other
students doing choreography work ior
this week's show are Donna Dewsnap.
