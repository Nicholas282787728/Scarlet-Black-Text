ing the Concordia Comets with a
score of 19-18 — despite injuri“ to
all-Conference senior linebacker
Mike Anderson, senior halfback
Craig Whitaker and sophomore full-
back Shannon Gocke.

Grinnell Begins Search
for Environment Expert

By Diane Brumley

Grinnell is beginning a national
search for an environmental expert
to serve as an environmentalrintcrr
cst professor, thanks to a $450,000
grant from the Henry Luce Founda-
tion.

College officials last week an
nounced the search for candidates
for the Henry R. Luce Professorship
in Nations and the Global Environ-
ment, an appointment that would
begin in the fall of 1990 and last for
five years.

The foundation, named for its
founder and one—time editor of'fime
magazine, Henry R. Luce, has been
granting professorships since 1969
to “encourage academic innovation
through an integrative approach to
the humanities, the social sciences,
and related disciplines."

Dean Charles Duke said that the
Luccprogram willhavea“realinter»
departmental focus." The proposal
for the professorship said the pro
gram “will emphasize the relation-
ship between science, public policy.
and global needs.”

The grant awarded to Gtinncll
College was one of only three of its
kind made this year to private col-
leges and universities nationwide.
The proposal for the professorship

makes a point that “the liberal ans
curriculum offers an ideal medium
forcultivatinginterdisciplinarystudy
of world environmental issues” and
that “integration” is the goal of the
program.

The college is seeking someone
who would ideally have “expertise
in one area yet have interests and ex-
periences as a generalist which would
enable him or her to link several
areas to the primary focus on the
global environment,” as outlined by
the proposal, Duke added that the
college is seeking “a pretty well-
known person. already working in
an interdisciplinary area."

Four possible candidates for the
program were identified in the pr0~
posal, each having qualifications
such as pastor current involvement
with the Us. government as well as
specialized knowledge regarding
globalissues such astheozonelayer,
effects of technological development
on the environment and natural re-
source extraction.

Duke said that the grant of
$450,000 was not for salary alone,
but would also be used to pay for
guest lecturers, a secretary, confer-
ences and fringe benefits

The college hopes to announce is
selection for the Luce Professorship
next spring
