iii Aoderle Exhibit
Charms Print and Study Room

by Vincent Presser

it is unfortunate that the
opening of the Jiri Anderle ex
hibit has lacked the attention,
and therefore the excitement, of
last year‘s exhibit oi works by
another Czech artist, Jan liree
jci, The importance or both ex.
hibits is in revealing an Eastern
Block nation’s aesthetic, in its
own way a very modern one. If
i may make so mundane a rerere
ence, both exhibits remind me of
modern Czech stamps from my
stamp-collecting days. There
was the same usevof clear blues
and oranges, applied abstractly
to a perhaps more representar
tionalist design.

But those very designs have
silnilarities that go back to old
Czech peasant Culture, Think
of peasant textiles of the East~
ern Block nations. Think of
the stylized grimns or Egypt‘s
ancient Coptic tiles. Or recall
the patterns and colors (muddy,
yet somehow very pure in the
way that gonaches sometimes
arel or turnroI-the-centnry Ruse

siau genre painting.

How does all this relate to the
work at hand? Well, separate
from the fasllionrridden world of
Western art, Czech artists must
use older, politically acceptable
artists, the Old Masters, [or in-
spiration during their own rigs
orous training. But in iollowing
these older traditions, the artists
still experiment, especially in
composition and technique, An-
derle, in his work after Vermeer
of a lady reading, made “ﬂaws"
in his plate, thereby creating a
sort of has relief that is espe
cially interesting in the way that
it deﬁnes the letter that the lady
holds. The technical skill in all
these works is very impressive.

The problem with Anderle is
that in these works he is largely
a copyisl, the leastrrespected
sort of artist in the West, or
course, the works will not be
thought “equal“ to those of the
Old Masters, at least in part be—
cause Anderle’s work cannot ac-
curatelv reﬂect their aesthetic,

but must instead diil'er, be—
speaking the aesthetics or our
own age. His works are very sen-
sitive and have much charm, es-
pecially in the prints after Car»
avaggio (although there is notlk
ing in the rendering of tone, or
the lack of ripe form, that is _
Caravaggiesque).

Despite their being friends; »

and allies, I ﬁnd Anderle’s work
much superior to the work of,
Jan Krejcl due to an aesthetic ,
that is less determined by the i
look of cormiiercial art It-
is strange that, while lire
pains us with the dewy, melt
ing, baby eyes or his nndes,‘
their crudely forthright bodies
lack even the delicacy of the was
tercolors of Sir William Russell
Flint, RA, which were famous
at mid—century for their aristoa
cratic porn.

This exhibit is well worth sec,
ing, and you must insh youe
selves to the Print and Study
Room, because the exhibit ends
on September 25.

Soul Asylum Fought the Law, but the Law Won

“Fuck the 'copsi ’Fuck the cops!
Fuck the cops!"

The chant rose defiantly in
the crisp air but quickly sub
sided Flashing red and white
police lights were cast, against
the now-empty stage. Len"
Larsen hoarsely tried to explain
to the crowd what was going on
and why,

As Soul Asylum went through
their sound check at 5 P.M.,
roadies unloaded the guitars,
drmns, amps, and Hannns beer
from the van. The curiosity of
the Mac Field frisbee crowd dise
turbed no one in the band or
crew. “Boy, they are loud,"
one may have thought, but hell,
when you are into Phil Collins
and Suzanne Vega, everything
is oppressively noisy. Nobody
could have predicted that four
hours later the local 3 5. unit
would stop a rock-and-roli cone
cert, and by this action raise se-
rious questions about the town‘s
relationship with the college and
the college's relationship with
its students.

small but steadily growing. The
band was dressed in old faded
blue jeans and T-shirts. Tile
longrhaired lead singer led Carl,
Grant, and Dan through a series
of scorching original composi:
tions, The impassioned singing,
ﬁghting to be heard over the car
coplionic roar, created great ten
sion in the band and crowd, The
sexuality of rock and roll was
probably never more obvious to
many in the crowd, the screams
of passion being replaced by the
wail of the twin guitars. Slowly
building, the tension increased
through each song, to be re-
leased ill a shattering climax of
white noise and parched vocals.

I wasn't totally ﬂuent with
the Soul Asylum catalog, but
I did discern a few songs from
the ﬁrst half of the set includ
ing “Quad song," “Closer to
the Star," and “Miracle Mile."
Tame slam-dancing was going
on near the stage, and while
