Divestment: the time'is now

 

by t)wen Charles

For too long, Grinnell College
has indirectly supported racial op
pression, unrepresentative
government, and labor conditions
bordering on slavery in South
Africa. The people who should be
involved in this matter are not
hidden away in some office in
Macy House, but rather are the
students. the iacuity. the ad-
ministration. and the trustees who
represent the college‘s interests,

The issue of divestment has
been on campus for over a decade.
However, student activism has
waned in recent years. Pro-
grusivism has faded into Pseudo-
liberalism and most recently to a
low ebb of pro-Reagan sentimens
tality on campus

Given that die administration is
not very receptive to divestment,
and the trustees have been over-
whelmingly against it, it is up to
student concern and active in-
volvement to convince our Board
of Trustees to divest the college's
stocks held in corporations active
in South Africa.

South African lifestyle is
centered around APARTHEID,
which is a codified system of
racism which denies the country's
non»white population the rights to
free assembly, free movement,
suffrage. habeus corpus, freedom
from torture, and many other fun-
damental human rights,

South Africa is the only nation in
the world Where racial
discrimination is the law of the
land, and nearly all the nations of
the world are in agreement in
their condemnation of apartheid,

U.S. corporations play an active
role in supporting apartheid
through the provision of materials
and technology, economic Support
provided in the form oi tax
revenues and financial services,
and the legitimizing effect of their
presence, A South Africian
government official has been
quoted as saying, ”If not exactly
the Good Hosuekeeping seal of ap
proval, the presence of companies
like Ford and GM, is at least a
sign of international support.”

The conclusion of the U.S,
Senate subcommitte on Africa
report, “US. Corporate Interests
in Africa”, sum up the true result
of the U.S. corporate presence in
South Africa: .

“Collectively, U.
, porations Vopera, g

South Africa have made
no significant impact on
either relaxing aparr
theid or in establishing
company policies which
would offer a limited but
important model of
multinational responr
sibility. Rather, the net
effect of American ill-
vestment has been to
strengthen the economic
and military selfr
Sufficiency of South
Africa’s apartheid
regime, undermining the
fundamental goals and
objectives of us. foreign
policy.”

There can be no hope of ending
apartheid by working within the
corporations. Pressure from
within corporations has been
largely ineffective, and while
some reform measures have been
put forward, they have not been
adhered to and are largely irrele-
vant to the problems of apartheid.
it is the ﬁnding of the report “U.S.
Corporate Interests in Africa",
that the record of U.S. corpora-
tions has been no better than
South African corporations con
cerning the welfare of black
African workers

Divestment is clearly the most
effective and immediate way to
stop support of apartheid; to can
iinue to hold stocks in corpora-
tions operating in South Africa is,
de facto, to support apartheid.

By divesting. an institution
states that it does not approve of
the actions of U.S. corporations
operating in Soth Africa. nor of
the South African government's
policies. Such a public statement
pressures corporations and the
South African government to
cease their unethical behavior.
Both corporations and the South
African government are respon-
sive to the pressure of public 0in
nion, and this pressure is
necessary to bring corporate in-

. volvement in apartheid to an end,

and eventually to bring the apar-
theid policy to an end.

Many opponents of divestment
argue that the effects of corporate
withdrawal inside South Africa
would be detrimental, and that by
staying in South Africa, corpora-
tions can help bring about
peaceful change. They argue that

a pullout of (1.3. corporations»

.ould. create. . , .empldyme .

depress the economy, make pmr
gressive measures less likely and
ultimately bring South Africa
closer to a bloodbath. Evidence
from South Africa suggest vastly
different conclusions:

First, U.S. corporations con-
tribute to the continuation of the?
statusquo rather than peaceful
change, and to continue the status
quo is to continue repression.

Second, the “reforms” which
have been made by U.S. corpora
tions are seen by South African
blacks as a “coverrup" and mean~
ingless in the context of their
situation, Black South Africans
agree that a US. corporate pull-
out would cause economic hard-
ship, but prefer ireedom and
equality to continued apartheid
rules, and have stated that they
are willing to make die necessary
sacrifices.

Third. there is no evidence to
suggest that economic progress in
South Africa can be equaled with
easing apartheid. The conditions
of South Africa’s blacks worsened
considerably during the decade of
the 1570's. while the country
entered upon a period of steady
economic growth and prosperity.

Finally. many black leaders in
South Arfica argue that a blood-
bath is most likely if the status
quo continues and assert that
divestment and pressure on the
South Airican government to
change are the last hopes for aver»
ting Such'a bloodhath.

In the most recent meeting of
the South African Support Group
with trustees, we were given one
more argument against divest-
ment: Grinnell. as an educational
institution dedicated to the prin-
cipal of “Liberal Arts”, should not
become involved in politics

I say the college’s political
neutrality is not at issue when it
comes to corporate investor's
responsibility. We (the college)
are investors. and as such it is our
duty to make our investments
responsible ones: the issue is one
of ethics, not politic .

The repression and exploitation
is clear, the positions of the South
African government and the in

volved US. corporations are.

clear. What has not been made
sufficiently clear is student con-
cern . and 'the ' college‘s respon~
sibility —DIVESTNOW! ' '

A few ideas on
communication

By Barry Edwards

The mass media is the primary
means by which thoughts are
communicated throughout
societies, It is on one level a com-
municator of news, And on a dif~
ferent level, it is the soapbox for
thought--the springboard for
debate. It is die preserver and in-
itiator of the conflicts which pres
duce change, either in thought or
condition, and it informs the
public whether the people’s con
cerns are being considered and
whether their needs are being
met. On a daily scale, it provides
needed entertainment and a
chance for relaxation.

In order to be effective in any of
these roles, a newspaper must
have both accuracy and quality.
Accuracy would encourage trust,
and the additional quality, of
course, would attract more
readers, A newspaper needs these
essentials in order to,have the
respect necessary to gain an au-
dience. thus acquiring influence.
To attain these goals, it must have
dedication from its staff. and it
must have input from its readers.

The Grinnell College Scarlet
and black is a good paper, but it
could be improved, It still needs
more interest from all aspects of
the Grinnell community. Most
especially, the S fir B needs more
people willing to spend time to
write. This would give it addi-
tional diversity and a greater
scope of articles to choose from,
The former would enable the S S:
B to interest a larger number of
readers, and the latter would
allow the editors the freedom to
choose the better articles instead
of relying on whatever might be
given to them.

One option for attaining this
greater realm of interest would be
for the members of the Grinnell
community to suddenly take im-
mense pride in the college's ins
tellectual products and dedicate a
couple of hours each week to the S
or B. Surely, students would be
willing to share a little of
themselves in order to make Grin»
nell College a better place, Yeah,
and maybe we can syndicate
William F. Buckley and “Bloom
County” while we're at it,

Another option would be tor the
college to offer some recognition
of the staff's efforts. This could be
achieved through any of several
means. One possibility would be
for the School to transform more
of the regular jobs into paying

positions (although, of course, we '

niiglit'have to drop Will‘ B.‘or

.' “Bloom County"). This would'add ’

some incentive, but it would be ex-
pensive and would cause pro-
blems concerning how to deter-
mine who would receive
pecuniary compensation for their
efforts. It would also demand that
the administration pay students
working with other extra
curricular activities, thus
creating a dilemma revolving
around which roles deserve this
payment and which do not.

Another alternative for en-
couraging increased participation
would be for the college to offer
academic credit to students who
write regularly for the S [it B. This
could be justified by recognizing
that writing a weekly column for
the 5 iii B requires between thirty
and forty pages per semester,
which is more than most classes.

This alternative is viable,
although the administration
would perhaps be forced to offer
credit for other activities as well.
It would, however, ' pire more
participation in acti ties thereby
improving several aspects of
Grinnell. Receiving credit for
such activities would allow
students who desire the ex-
perience to jusify denying some
time to their “academic" studies

in addition to thue options,
another possibility would be for
die administration to invite pro-
fessional journalists to critique
work. and offer their advice on
methods to improve the s lir b.
This course of action also could be
applied to other organizations on
campus. it would offer the
students a chance to grow (after
all, we are in Iowa: “A Place to
Grow”) in their areas of interest.
The professionals could help the
students improve their skills and
they could inform students about
similar organizations which
might interest them. in ap~
propriate areas, such as jourr
nalism. the professional might be
able to instruct interested
students how best to pursue a
career in their field. or how to ob
tain vacation employment in
these areas of interest,

Any of the options would help in-
spire student interest. And, inad
dition they would improve the
quality of several of the extra-
curricular activities which
students need for relaxation while
providing a constructive escape
from academic pressure—sort of
like the Pub.
