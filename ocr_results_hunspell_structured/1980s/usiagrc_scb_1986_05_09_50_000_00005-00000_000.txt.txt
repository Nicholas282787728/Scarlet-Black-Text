Case Study 1447: Hans Niehus, age 23.

Profile: A typical Grinnell senior (7).
art major, graduating this spring.

My report:

Hans grew up in Galesburg, Illinois, the
place where Dr Santa Maria bought a new
Sears food processor, drove home. and
chopped his wiie into smallish pieces. l-le
ted the respective parts into the recently
purchased electrical appliance, clean it.
then returned it to the store. complaining
that his wife didn't like how lt operated,
The store gave him his money back.

Hans' hobbies are anything, but par-
ticularly the crafts and lifestyles and the
basic “dibblesdabbling with nature” of
man from early times. “If some

paleolithic hunters happened to wander
out oi their time period. I'd grab my atl-atl
and be out there with them in a second,
tracking down that beast, across the tun~
dra or Noth Canipus,..whatever."

Alter graduation, the Grinnell senior
planson searching tor employment, “,But

not,” he‘says. "something in computer

programming or accounting,” Rather.
i-lans will try to iind a position with a living
history program, such as the one in
Williamsburg where a fort has been built
and the colonial time period has been
brought to the present. People there dress
in the clothes of the period. practice the
crafts, and become familiar with other
aspects of the culture,

Another option for Hans in life after
graduation is to teach in a small private
school, practicing open classroom techni-
ques If hired. he would take his classes
outdoors, help them to learn to appreciate
nature. and maybe mix some artistic pro-
jects in. “Quaker schools tend to look
good." he grinned seriously, showing his
pearly whites. He believes himself to be
qualifed lor such a job.

Hans' practical experience is extensive
due to his experimentation with “archair
technology" as he calls it. When I first met
Hans. he was on his knees and hunched
over a primitivelooking apparatus. After
a few moments of furiously running the
leather strung bow across a shaven length
oi stick held upright, its base planted in a
shallow blackened pit in the center of a
broad b’oard pressed flush to the floor. he
rocked back and casually ilipped a stray
lock of curly brown hair Off his forehead.
“I've gotten heat. smoke, and red coals,"
he said dismally, brushing some cooled
ash of his asbestos rugi “But no flame."

' The room’s fire alarm continued to buzz
quite obnoxiously.

I learned later of “acorn gruel." another
of his many proyects which had gained
tloor»wide iame. ”It was part oi a search
lor various organic ioods. though not as a
substitute for Quad" Hans seemed in-
trigued by his discovery that there weren't
many acorns on campus “1 round that on
campus there was a large squirrel popula-
tion Most of the available acorns were in
town, especially in front oi Roberta
Atwell's hous ' he explained

Ms Atuell. an education proiessor. was
not available for comment

Hans detailed the intricacies of the

“acorn gruel” process by simply explain»
ing that he collected two gallons ol nuts, let
them set in his room tor a couple oi weeks

until little white larvae-like creatures ap-
peared, shelled them by pounding on them
with rocks and prying them with his
fingernails, boiled the tanic acid from
them for three days. dried them in ﬁle
oven, and ground them into flour.

“How soupy is gruel?” I asked him.

He paused to let the question sink in.
“Why. it's just flour and water, 50000. I
imagine it depends on how much water you
add About the consistency of cream 0’
wheat is the most palatable."

Hans plans to bake bread with the re-
mainder of the acorn flour which he has
stored in a plastic container opn the bot-
tom shelf of the refrigerator at. home. back
behind the butter.

The most recent of Hans' endeavors to
examine nature close hand was the “skinns
ing of the squirrel ..

“No. I didn't kill |L I’foundi in the road
a little east oi Darby, and |t was in good
condltoin 7 not run over much. Still. I
would have preterred something larger,
say a deem..."

He took a garbage bag, picked up the
carcass
““Wlthvyour bare hands?” I interrupted.

“Yes. rigor mortis had notset in yet so it
was like holding a small happy animal, on-
ly it wasn't so happy."

.,,.,itnd dropped it into the plastic dep~
ths. He Carried it back to his room. scrubb-
ed ibs hands thoroughly, and wrapped it in
another bag.

“I double wrapped it in trash bags —
green or black. standard school issue 7
and sealed them with strapping tape. it
wasn't going to get out too easily.”

He placed it carefully in the freezer of
the fridge on the 3rd floor of Cleveland
Hall.

Later, Hans thawed the squirrel and car»
ried it across campus. through the Forum
Grill. where someone asked him, “What’s
that you got in the bag, Hans. a dead squir-
rel or somethin"?" A few mintues later he
presented it to Dr. Whittaker, Professor of
Anthropology. With iaculty supervisio
Hans cut it up, pulled the skin oil, or
jointed the limbs and severed the tail. The
cause oi death was a ruptured stomach
The bones went to Whittaker.

Back at the dorm. Hans cleaned the hide
by scraping the “lovely white and brown
mottled" fur and excess flesh from the
skin. then finally Washing it in a sink of
soapy water. Floor members were
disgusted and disgruntled and complained
of the stench, which dissipated only when a
fan was set in the bathroom.

The hide is now wrapped in an oiled bag
on Hans' window sill, Part will be tanned.
the rest made into rawhide.

The floor has settled down since the
squirrel incident.

“Two questions. What has Grinnell been
ior you, and will your sister iollow in your
footsteps after you've graduated?

"Grinnell is fun 7 got u lot of trees. I like
the trees " Pause "Not if she can avoid
it." he said.

Will you follow in your brothers
loolsteps?” tasked Karla

"Only if he takes really small strides.”
she answered vaguely a smile quit-king at
the corner of her muu .,

It looks that way

Letters

To the Editor:

Recently. l have been witness to a
number or events on campus that make me
ill at ease . .

Much lip service is given to the many
ways that students are included in the
decision making process at Grinnell Col-
lege. lpersonally have been both a witness
and a participant in some or these situa»
tions and would certainly attest to the {act
that students are allowed input to various
decisions on campus Lately, however, i
have become more aware oi the ways in
which students are _ to the best of my
knowledge — ignored and disregarded,

The new parking lot east or oarhy Gym-
nasium: Encompassing an area reaching
approximately 4/5 of the distance to the
'railroad tracks. it seems that none of us
knew about it until it appeared as an
eyesore and an obstacle to travel between
north and south campus, I realize that the
use of the Selence Building parking lot for
the Psychology addition creates a need;
but does it create a need that exceeds pre»
sent demand?

The Student Designed Concentration:
Disposed oi after just 15 minutes oi discus
sion at the April 21st Faculty Meeting, The
iaculty‘s biggest concern was that such an
addition to the curricular structure might
require an increase in their time commit-
ment and that this 5p ific addition lacked
“academic integrity," Furthermore. some
faculty members stated that it might
become so popular that there would be an
overabundance oi students wanting to
pursue this Student Designed Concentrar
tion. If this is so. it is all the more reason to
justify the institution of such legislation.
Nevertheless. the fact remains that no con-
sideration was given to student opinion. in
terest. initiative and/or desire for the Stu»
dent Designed Concentration

Addition and renovation of buildings:
The location oi the new psychology addlr
tion to the science building. coupled viilh
the iact that it is designed to rust meet cur-
rent needs without consideration for future
growth. Also consider the Younker renovas
tion and the failure to include lights on the
mirrors Only now is the administration
seeking student input on the building Coma
nutth in the form of a single student

nember,

Food Service Committee: A committee
of the past. but nonsexislent today. Where
is it and why did it go? Especially now that
so many people are becoming more
dissatisfied with the direction of the dining
halls.

Health Center Terminal Room:
Students. and in fact other affected consti-
tuencies, were notified only at the last sec
cond. '

Boycott of MGM films: Rather than be»
ing asked or consulted. we were told about
the policy. why wasn't. the campus coma
munity given input to a policy decision
having a direct impact on us? The boycott
is a nice gesture. but wouldn't it be nicer if
it was something we, as students. decided
upon for ourselves?

Coming back ii-oiii Spring Break on
Easter: While this may have becna simple
oversight. it might have been less apt to
happen had a student been on the Calendar
Committee Most of the faculty and ad»
ministration are in Grinnell for the
holidays master is one oi the biggies). the
vast majority oi the students are away
from Grinnell and Consequently had to
travel back on Easter Sunday. Although
Saturday might have been a sound alter-
native. it was very inconvenient since the
first meal in the dining hall was not served
until Sunday dinner.

The overall intent of this letter is not
meant to thoroughly debate these issues
nor to offer solutions. Instead it is meant
simply to stimulate discussion over these
issues with the hope or possibly encourage
ing the appropriate steps to prevent such
events irom occurring in the future. I also
do not mean to suggest that student input
is a crucial factor in all situations. nor is it
the single most important factor in sound
dcclsmn-makmg However. including the
students during the initial and final
decisionmaking process is crucial for a
harmonious campus environment.

We. as students are often more directly
ailected by these decisiois and policies
than are the faculty and administration. it
seems only logical that we be included at
some point in their lormulatioii — Mickey
