—Our View

Do we really get
what we pay fer?

The price of a Grinnell education is ever rising; is the educational
quality keeping pace']

A senior graduating in 1969 could be assured of graduation with a true
liberal arts educdtion. “Requirements for graduation with the Bachelor
of Arts degree from Grinnell College are met through a broadly based
education in the humanities, sciences and social studies." (Grinnell
College Catalogue, 1968439) This description essentially implies a core
curriculum comprised of certain courses in various disciplines. In addi-
tion a senior was required to complete at least four credits of work in in-
dependent study and to pass a senior comprehension examination in his
major field.

A senior graduating this May needs only to have taken a tutorial, to
have satisfactorily completed a major and to have earned at least 124
credits. .

Somehow the two educations just do not compare.

Even for those who think diverse does not necessarily better, a quick
glance at the changes in departmental requirements for an individual
major will also reveal significant qualitative differences.

Take the major of English as an example.

In 1969 an English major was required to take a minimum of 30
credits (of which none could be from another department), complete a
senior seminar and successfully pass a comprehensive examination on
twenty-one selected texts. A stringent series of prerequisites for each
muse existed, and the major was carefully structured to provide a stu»
dent with a fine literary background.

'Now the department requies 32 credits (up to eight of which may be
taken in related studies outside the department), Traditions I and II
and three upper-level courses. This department, unlike many others,
has preserved a foreign language requirement.

Again, the differences are evident, and the English department is
hardly an isolated case.

Now we are not suggesting that a core curriculum be reinstated. At

this time, at this institution, such a move would probably be a mistake.
Rather we feel that the continuity, breadth and depth which a core cur<
riculum provides should be sought once again, in a more active man»
ner.
. Some possible means to this end could be found in the following: more
stricter major requirements, thus preventing students from slipping
through with an uneven major; a revision of the tutorial system so that
it would provide a more fundamental groundwork for the student; a
more careful advising system to emphasize the value of balance in a
schedule; and more rigidly enforced prerequisites to assure that
students are not placed in upper-level courses without the necessary
background.

Should such changes he made, perhaps then the quality of a Grinnell
education would be commensurate with the price.

A' thought for the day

SGA cabinet elections will be held on March 8 and 9. Out of a student
body of over 1200, only four people have been nominated to run for the
positions of president and vice president. While everyone is capable of
drawing their own conclusions, it seems quite unlikely that any
justification for this poor turnout would reflect well on the student body.

May I take a message

“Life is so strange. And ain’t that the
truth?" In fact, that opening line is only a
drop in the intellectual bucket compared to
the wealth of wisdom one can discover by
reading other people‘s message boards.

For muse unfamiliar with the concept
“message board," it is simply‘ a board
upon which anyone may leave a message.
This is not to say that all message boards
are the same, because there is a spectrum
of varying sorts. For the sake of simplici—
ty, there are three common varieties

First there is the “Ziggy” genre, which
consists of plastic stretched over card-
board. A “famous” comic strip character
is then embossed on the plastic along with
a clever quote like “Messages” or ”Hi
there!” The manufacturer also supplies
the pen which is guaranteed to fade out
after one week

The second type is tlle notepad variety.
The only thing that is notable about the
notepad is that it is cerminly the least in-
teresting.

The third and possibly most popular type
is the scrap paper message board. It is the
cheapest as it is made up of the backs of
failed calculus exams, useless campus
mail or overdraft notices.

But, getting back to the material one can
find on message boards on any day of the
week, I have collected a few samples of
typical messages and will relate them to
you now. ‘

“Douglas MacArthur called
1,387,423,910,&I5,372 times." Now this may
be an inside joke, but anyone can see the

Bob Stry/ee

humor in it. First of all, one finds it hard to
believe anyone could call that many times,
and (Are you ready for this?) Douglas
MacArthur “faded away" some 19 years
ago! Isn't that rich?‘

“Johnny Cash is the silliest person I've
ever seen play a guitar.” I don‘t feel that
any comment is needed for that particular
message.

“Get off the ﬂoor or you will die." A han-
dy piece of advice indeed, lhis person was
obviously warning another that. being on
the floor may be hazardous. It‘s comfor—
ting to see such human compassion on
campus these days.

“Mike, ll you enter this room, you will be
shot at.“ As messages go, this has to be
one of the most direct. In this case, “Mike"
is allowed to take fate into his own hands.
Mike, for God’s sake, we don’t need any
more homicides in this country. Please
stay out of that room.

There are so many more, but space and
discretion dictates that they remain un—
printed here.

But, “since you didn't have any
messages, I thought rd give you one.”

The following is a joke (2) that l heard
the other day. I’m really not sure whether
it is rude, crude or just very strange: What
is the similarity between Mrs, O'Leary’s
cow and an aardvark that is a camp
mascot?

One kicked over the lamp and the other
licked over the camp.

It is definitely very strange.

Defense authorization bill

To the Editor:

In the article “JB Tables Guidelines” in
the Feb. 18 Scarlet and Black, it was
reported that the Trustees “opposed the
enforcement of the Federal Selective Ser-
vice Law, which requires colleges to deny
financial aid to all students who do notpro—
ve that they have registered for the draft."

I assume it is the Defense Authorization
Bill which is being referred to, passed with
an amendment denying federal Student aid
to those who do not prove they have
register-d. Aid programs affected are
Guaranteed Student Loans, Auxiliary
Loans, National Direct Student LDans, Pell
Grants, Supplemental Grants, College
Work/Study Assistant and State Student
Incentive Grants. Regulations have been
proposed by the Department of Education
to put this amendment into effect on July 1,
198$

While I don't. expect that their opposition
to the enforcement of this law will extend
to disobeying it, I am encouraged by this
announcement by the Trustees. All
members of the college community should
inform the Trustees of meir support in op-

The Israeli question

To the Editor:

In David Kopelman's column “The
Israel Question,” he attempted to prove
that Israel should be supported. Ile exr
plains that Israel should be supported
because it is the only demorcracy m the

, Middle East, because the Israeli govern-

ment is the only one to counter Soviet inr
tervention and because it is no crueler in
war than it is supposed to be. Israel does
need as much support as she always has.
Nevertheless, the changes in her actions
and policies are forcing supporters to
revitalize their tactics, The columnist‘s
reasons are much too narrow and dated to
comply with the increasingly complex
situation that Israel now faces.

In the last few years Israel has shown
traits which have shocked and confused
her advocates. The entire Lebanon crisis,
including the massacre in Sabra and

posing the amendment on constitutional
grounds. (A suit is pending a decision in
Minnesota, promised by the end 0
February.) In addition, the Trustees
should be persuaded to provide alternativ—
means of assistance. If the college is t-
positively support those students who can
not (or chose not to) prove their innocenc-
prior to any accusations of guilt, alterna -.
sources of financial help must be provide it
for those applicants who will need to fil-
for assistance after this coming July.

Commenm are being accepted by th
Secretary of Education only until tomor
row, Sat., Feb. 26. Phone in any questlo “
to the secretary at (202) 4274300. Send
telegrams to: Ms. Andra Foley, Office 0'
Student Financial Assistance, U.S
Department or Education, 400 Marylan-
Ave. S.W., Room 4318 Regional Offic-
Building 3, Washington, D.C., 20202.

There is not much time to act, but w
must strongly support those who wish t
remain protected by the concepts em
bodied in the Bill of Rights. 7 Sincerely

Shatilla, have raised confusion to it
highest degree.

It is necessary for us to acknowledge an
accept that Israel is experiencing
dramatic change. She is followin
diplomatic means to peace, as in the Cam
David Peace agreements. but she is 315
taking aggressive routes to ensure her no
thern borders. As Israel develops an
changes. so must the attitudes of her a-
vocates. Merely to list three isolat
reasons to support her is to be insensitlv
to the broader dilemmas mat are plaguin
Israel supporters.

All of us who support Israel must searc
our souls and try to understand the cou
try’s plight and distinguish between he
mistakes and her means of survival. W
must maintain flexibility to support Isra
through nus new phase other history.
Sincerely, Ilene Weismehl
