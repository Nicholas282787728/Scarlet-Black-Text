A look into the past, present and future

Democrats

The Campus Democrats have been
around as long as most people can
remember, despite the fact that this is
Iowa. According to Brad Vander Linden,
the group receives excellent student sup-
port, “We’re by iar the most powerful
political group on campus.” He added that
the status of the organization has always
been strong.

The group aims to “provide an outlet for
people to participate in the political
system," notes Vander Linden. He
believes that the people involved learn
valuable skills in such areas as organizing
campaigns and getting people to the polls
to Vote.

Like any political party, the Democratic
organization experiences its busiest times
around elections. However, Vander Linden
emphasized that the group is active year
round. Currently, the organization is try-
ing to lobby the Iowa Legislature to defeat
the proposed bill of raising the drinking
age to 21.

As far as future plans, Vander Linden
stated that the group would be calling a
campus-wide meeting to recruit new
members. They will also be corresponding
with presidential candidates to ask them to
speak at Grinnell. “Our biggest goal,"
commented Vander Linden, “is to have a
Statewide televised debate between all the
presidential candidates that come to Grin-
nell."

There has been a good turnout from
Grinnell in past elections, and, because of
this, Grinnell has been allotted an increase
ed number of delegates to the county cons
vention in February of next year, accor~
ding to Vander Linden.

He encourages students to think of can-
didates for the presidency and go to the
caucuses. From there, students can be
elected to the county convention, the
district convention and then to the state
convention. Vander Linden remarked that
ambitious students from the state conven-
tion could even run for the national con-
vention to select a Democratic presiden-
tial nominee for 1984.

Vander Linden is optimistic about the
future strength of the Democratic
organization: “We’ve laid the foundations
to allow studean to make sure it remains a
vibrant political force in Poweshiek Coun-
ty and ﬂiroughout the state."

SASG

by Terri Porter

Although the South African Support
Group (SASG) has been around only since
December of 1980, there has been an
awareness on campus for several years of
the apartheid system in South Africa.

This system exploits the blacks in South
Africa. According to SASG spokespersons,
the blacks, comprising more than 70 per-
cent ol’ the population, receive only 13 per-
cent of the land.

Before SASG was formed, an article in
ﬁle Oct. 4, 1974, issue of the 5&3 focused on
this situation. An excerpt from the article
states: “The specter of apartheid haunts
every aspect of South African society from
education to censorship to personal
privacy. Official education policy Says
that white children must be prepared for a
dominant role in society; non-whites for a
subordinate role."

The SASG spokespersons clarified this
“subordinate role" with a number of
observations. For example, blacks legally
cannot vote or travel. if they go into a
designated white area for reasons other
than working, they can be held indefinite-
ly. There are laws to ensure that the blacks
do not revolt.

Not only are there political examples or
oppression, but there is economic exploita-
tion as well. This is manifested by the
American corporations in South Africa
that employ blacks to work for them at
slave labor prices.

Since Grinnell is one of the many institu»
tions that owns stocks in these South
African companies, the college is con
tributing to the exploitation oi the blacks
there.

Hence, members of SASG support
divestment 7 the selling of the stock that
Grinnell has in companies in South Africa.
As an SASG spokesperson stated, “We
stand for the dismantling of the apartheid
system in South Africa. We're doing the
best we can from where we are.”

In the short time the group has been
organized, SASG has accomplished quite a
bit. One spokesperson noted that the col-
lege had no policy regarding the situation
until last year. They now have a “social
responsibility policy” in which the college
recognizes the situation in South Africa as
one that needs changing.

This change may at least begin in the
form of proxy resolutions, which was a
compromise that SASG offered to the
Board of Trustees earlier this year. The
compromise, according to the Nov. 12,
1952, issue of the 5&3, allows for selected
students “to review and propose
stockholder resolutions calling on corpora-
tions to sign and comply with the Sullivan
Code [statement of corporate responsibili-
ty for the involvement in South Africa] and
other actions involving South Africa."

The members of SASG, although retain
ing the idea of divestment, have an initial
objective of ending the apartheid system.
“We want the change whatever channel it
goes through 7 either divestment or proxy
resolutions," emphasized one spokespere
son.

The current focus of the group’s activity
is somewhat different than in the past. As

' the spokespersons noted, “Because of the

proxy resolutions, the actual work oi‘SASG
doesn’t center on the campus. However,
the goal of changing the situation in South
Africa is still the same.”

They added, “We hope that students
don‘t lose interest just because it‘s not a
local interest anymore."

Women’s group

by Barb Little

Organizations at Grinnell change with
the times. Women's Group is an example
of such an organization. Anyone who
remembers the Women's Group from
three or four years ago is sure to see a
noticeable change in the overall goals and
aims of the group, Gone are the days of
radical feminism and bra-burning
brigades. Sue Schneck and Mary Ester,
this year's cochairs, stress the fact that
Women‘s Group today is an educational
organization. "We don't want this to be
consciousness-raising. We want a group of
women who can share and educate one
another,” Schneck emphasized.

In the past. Women’s Group went
through phases of being anything from a
lesbian/feministgroup to a poltical activist
organization, The emphasis of the group
depends primarily on who is in it and who
runs it,

page 3 Scarlet and Black February 18. 1933

A 10-year evaluation of Grinnell’s
Women's Group shows a noticeable in
crease in campus involvement and a trend
from activist to informational pro-
ceedings. In 1972, the group was basically
concerned with supplying Grinnell women,
both students and faculty, with further op-
portunities for involvement. They examin-
ed the possibility of including a women's
studies program in the curriculum, money
was requested from the Initiative Fund for
women's activities and a campaign to hire
more women faculty was high on the list oi
priorities. This evolved into the birth of the
Iowa Women's Political Caucus in 1973.

The first organizational meeting started
with Roxanne Conlin. It was founded on a
nationwide basis in Hill and was concern-
ed with using the political process to im-
prove the lives of women. The group’s ma-
jor concern was “ just getting women in the
legislature."

The 1974 group concerned themselves
with supplying Grinnell women with a
resource center {or women's information
housed in the Health Center. Adding
women’s literature to the American

Civilization reading list was also a project.
ms was to be the year of continual ac-
tivities to provide a better forum for shar-
ing ideas and experiences and for
strengthening the overall community of
Grinnell women.

The National Organization for Women
set up the Grinnell chapter in me, believ»
ing that it was essential for the college to
be keenly aware of women’s issues and to
have an affirmative action policy. now
acted as the link between town and college
and virtually replaced the Women's Group
on campus. The longstanding Grinnell
tradition, implemented in the mid—605, lost
its impact and authority.

The Women's Group didn't reform until
1909 after being dormant lor four years.
They provided politcal and emotional sup-
port for women. The campus had trouble
taking the group seriously, probably as a
result to the ineffectiveness of previous
groups. The group did not consider
diemselves to be a militant group; they
were anxious “to look forward, not back".
There were needs to be met, emotionally
and poltlcally, and in 1979 they were met.

Those who were around {or the 1909-80
year remember the series of assaults
which occurred early in 1950. This proe
moted the Women's Group. and the came
pus community, to launch a campaign to
inform women on postrrape procedures,
and an attempt was made to establish an
ellective escort service. Eventually the
group hopes to institute this as a work-
study program, The system will be
available in the evening hours between B
p.m. and 2 a.m. and will be located at the
Health Center.

The escort service is a policy that the
1933 Women's Group hopes to continue.
This volunteer service should go into effect
after break as a trial run.

GCGC

Beginning in the tail of 1973 with an an»
nouncement in the 54:8 inviting people to
an open meeting, the Grinnell College Gay
Community (GCGC) has steadily become
a prominent institution at Grinnell.

According to an article in the April 26,
1974, issue of the SSA}, GCGC had made
several advancements that year. These in-
cluded “regular weekly meetings to
discuss the various aspecLs of being gay;
recognition of the need for adequate gay
counseling services at Grinnell; and open—
ing communications with established gay
communities at other academic institu-
tions in Iowa. with the University of lowa
in particular."

Another major step came when, in
September of 1974, an introduction to a
weekly column called “Gay Perspectives”
appeared in the 5&3 and was written by
members of GCGC. The purpose of the col-
umn, according to this introduction, was
“to provide an open forum for issues of
concern to the gay communiy, while in-
creasing campus sensitivity to homosex-
ual oppression."

The column no longer exists, but the
weekly meetings still do. They are headed
by Matt Adams and are open to both les-
bians and gays.

Adams, explaining the function oi
GCGC, stated, “We're mostly here so that
people who are questioning their sexuality
don’t feel like they’re the only ones in the
world."

He noted that the group, besides having
their weekly meetings, is often busy with
organizing activities. “It‘s important for
us, being so isolated, to develop a sense of
connectedness and caring," Adams coma
merited.

The group has not been as involved in
planning activities this year as in the past.
mainly because this has been a
developmental year for the organization.
As Adams says, “A lot ofwhat has been go-
ing on has been setting up the gay com-
munity."

It the group has a goal right now, it is “to
make the campus more aware and make
people more accepting," stated Adams.
He continued, “I think we’ll- always be
striving to eliminate prejudice."

Will the general reaction be any difr
ferent in the future? “It's hard to say
because there's a certain segment of the
population whose feelings never change on
both sides of the issue," Adams explained.
“I would hope it shiits to a more open acc
ceptance, but I don’t know."

Republicans

The Campus Republicans have been
around probably as long as the Democrats.
but as Leeann Clayton, leader of the group.
noted, ”I don’t think it ever really was a
big organization.”

Clayton further commented, “There
aren’t very many Republicans on campus,
so there's not a great deal of support." She
stated that there are eight to 10 really ac-
tive members who are “willing to work."

Even with the small number of people,
Clayton believes that it is a good founda-
tion on which to build, As to why there are
not more active members, Clayton
replied, “It’s kind of hard to generate in-
terest.”

According to Clayton, the Republican
group on campus is in a rebuilding stage.
She remarked, “We are steering away
from campaigning, although it‘s impor-
tant, and concentrating on bringing
speakers to the campus."

Clayton hopes that the speakers, along
with other coordinated activities, will
“present an alternate, clear viewpoint to
enhance the students‘ understanding of the
issues."

The Campus Republicans will become
stronger in the future if Clayton‘s convic~
tions are correct. She stated, “1 see an my
flux of more conservative students into
Grinnell in the future.”

She concluded by saying, “People know
we're here; it's ]ust a matter of them com-
ing out. "
