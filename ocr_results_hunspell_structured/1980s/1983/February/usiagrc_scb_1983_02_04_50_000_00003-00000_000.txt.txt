A scene from “Allegro Brillnnie” to be performed by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet

tonight in Roberta Theateri

While Grinnell has long been unique in
its ability to lure artistic events “to the
corniields,” tonight's appearance of the
Royal Winnipeg Ballet promises to be one
of the most grandiose and exciting perfor-
mances ever at the college. it is not sur~
prising, then, that tonight's performance
was almost completely sold out, with
ticket lines stretching from the Forum
Desk to South Lounge.

Sponsored by the Public Events Com-
mittee chaired by Professor of English
James Kissane, plans lor tonight‘s perfor-
mance have long been in the making, This
week, construction has been underway to
resurface the stage in Roberts Theatre
According to Kissane, the ballet requires a
surface of 5/3 inches above the concrete
which lies directly beneath the Roberts
stage.

The ballet has traveled widely and was
the first Canadian company to tour in
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union The
traveling company consists of 25 dancers,
lo musicians and a production crew with 22
tons of equipment including two pianos.
Live music provided by the ballet s musi-
cians will be augmented by taped ore
chestral recordings.

More than
Urban Sprawl

 

At The Main Event Saturday, 9:30 p.m.,
Darby Gym

“Into the live element," The Suburbs
have fun, dance, play their instruments,
travel . . . . “It's in our music," said lead
guitarist Beej Chaney while explaining the
unique appeal of his band.

From Minneapolis, The Suburbs are one
of America's most innovative new Wave
bands. With an emphasis on rhythm and
syncopated boats, The Suburbs are
dynamic, danceable and delightfully deca-
dent.

The Suburbs have been receiving inter-
national acclaim since the release of their
second LP, “Credit in Heaven," (on Tom
Carson’s best of 1981 list in The Village
Voice) and a Billboard dance Top 100
single, “Music for Boys." Featured at the
Danceteria in New York City and at 'hlts
in Chicago, The Suburbs' fast»paced sound
has been compared to that of the EST: and
The Raybeats.

The Shakin’ Pyramids
Authentic Rockabilly

Tuesday, lo p.m.. North Lounge

On their way to The Ritz in New York cj.
ty, the Scottish rockabilly band the Shakin’
Pyramids will play Grinnell this Tuesday
at 10 pm. in North Lounge.

Like the Stray Cats, the Shakin’
Pyramids feature rockabilly music.
However, according to Concerts Chairper'
son Daniel Klatz who recently saw the
band in Chicago, their sound is “more
authentic rockabilly" than that offered by
other current bands,

‘The Bookcase

Douglas Jerrold once said, "A blessed
companion is a book — a book that, at a
touch, pours its heart into our own."

Indeed, as long as books have existed,
good books have been revered. A good
book can provide many things for a reader
— an opportunity to laugh, a reason to cry,
a chance to dream or guidance into unex-
plored territories.

Throughout the semester, the SGtB will
be printing a list of two or three professors'
favorite books. You might find that a list of
a particular professor's favorite books
may reveal more about that person behind
the rostrum than would an entire semester
of classes.

Professor Jon Andelson, department of an~
thropoiogy:

1. Tristcs Tropiques, Claude Levi-Strauss
2. Waiting the Godot, Samuel Beckett

3. The Return of the Native‘ Thomas Har-
ﬂy

4. The Milagro Beanfield War,
Nichols

5. Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll .

John

 

The band consists of four members who
play electric guitar, the acoustic guitar,
acoustic bass and drums, The percuse
sionist, who uses only two drums, also does
vocals.

Perhaps the best current rockabilly
band in the world, the Shakin’ Pyramids
are experiencing widespread success in
Europe and recently appeared on the
English Top 20,

Following this concert tour, their first
and perhaps only in the United states, the
Shakin’ Pyramids will return to their
home in Glasgow, Scotland, less than one
week after their Grinnell performance.

Because of their exceptional quality and
the short duration of their tour, the Con-
certs Committee decided to alter its cur-
rent policy and Schedule the band for a
weeknight.

A band that ”truly rocks, " the Shakln
Pyramids should not be missed!

A Lion in Winter — (1967)

The second film of the Katharine Hep-
burn film series, A Lion in Winter is a
dynamic story about the contest of will bet»
ween Queen Elizabeth of Aquitaine (Hep
burn) and Henry 11 (Peter O’Toole),

Their conflict, more than just a
psychological struggle for the upper hand,
centers on important issues faced by izth
century European royalty: the disposition
of inheritanccs and the arranging of ad-
vantageous marriages.

A fun movie, A Lion in Winter should not
leave anyone disappointed.

Thunderhall — (1965)

Thunderball is neither good nor bad; it's
Bund. This time Bond (played by the
original 007, Sean Connery) is pitted
against Spectre's 72 man, Largo, who is
plotting to destroy a us. city unless he
receives in) million pounds.

One of the most spectacular of the early
Bond movies, expert cinematography and
imagery serves to enhance Thunderhali's
somewhat dubious plot line.

Like any other Bond film, Thunderball
should provide good laughs and entertain-
ment. However, studens are encouraged
to enjoy the film without trying to equal
James Bond's somewhat violent antics.
(See Ruth Katz‘s article on the editorial
page.)

The Weavers: Wasn‘t That a Time? —
(1982)

A documentary about the Carnegie Hall
reunion of the Weaver’s four original
members ~ Pete Seegcr, Lee Hays, Rope
nie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, Wasn‘t
That a Time? is one of the bat films of its
kind in recent years. n-

Described by Rolling stones as “engage
ing and affectionate, " Wasn‘t That a
Time? offers a new look at an old group
which is seemingly no worse for wear. The
film is particularly significant because it
was completed shortly before the death of
Weaver Lee Hays.

All in all, Wasn't That a Time? is a truly
worthwhile film and this week's best
choice.

Foreign Film Series v Kagamusha (The
Shadow Warriors)

Kagamusha (The Shadow Warriors),
winner of the 1980 grand prize at the Can
nes Film Festival, is an epic tale of sur-
vival centering around two men who
shaped history in lsthcentury Japan. It is
director Akira Kurosawa's most recent
achievement in a long line of master-
pieces.

Distinguished by brilliant camera work,
Kagamusha reaches the same level of ar-
tistic direction and character development
as Kurosawa’s previous films. “Museum
of Modern Art Notes" says, “Kurosawa re-
mains the poet of the world cinema."
Kurosawa, Bergman, Satyajit Ray, de
Sica and Fellini — the list is not long of the
men who create films to their own vision of
life and art, Kurosawa’s Kngamusha con~
tinues in this tradition.

From Harlem to Harvard

Directed by a graduate student at Har
Vard, this film deals not only with racial in
tegration, but with a broader issue of
tolerance. The film confronts the idea of
mixing different cultures and lifestyles,
feelings of alienation and the inevitable
quest to “fit in." This film is not a success
story: it’s the story of a man's struggle to
cope with psuedosuccess.
