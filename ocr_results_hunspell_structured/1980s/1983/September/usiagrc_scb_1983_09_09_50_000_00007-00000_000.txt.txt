by Paula Powell

“Just as a Grinnell College expects ex»
cellence in academics, so should it expect
excellence in athletics. Both athletes and
athletic teams should be expected to win,”
maintains Veronika Platzer, a sophomore
on the Grinnell track and field team. And
she does win. In the spring of her freshman
year at Grinnell, Veronika qualified for na-
tionals in track and field and placed let
out of 75 in the shotput.

Platzer participated in basketball for
two years at the high school level in Col-
orado Springs, Colo, After repeated team
defeats, she was prompted by a friend to
try the shotput l-ier desire to win led to
three state appearances; she also par~
ticipated in {our national track and field
competitions.

Platzer has had to work hard to achieve
this success. She explains that she trains
year round, spending up to three hours a
day on her workout during the regular
season.

“To throw the shotput well, one needs
strength, speed, flexibility, and ex
plosiveness. It takes years of physical and

mental development to perfect your
technique. Especially since the technique
is constantly changing.” '

While Platzer remains an intense come
petitior, she has experienced a change in
attitude while at Grinnell. “My freshman
year I was extremely frustrated. Because
I was atheletlc, people told me I was in the
wrung school. I felt as if i really Stuck out,
I also placed big expectations on others."

“Now however, I've lightened up. I
myself have become more intense, but I
don’t expect the same from my teamr
mates," Platzer continues.

At Grinnell, Platzer trains under the
guidance of Evelyn Freeman, women's in
door and outdoor track coach, Coach
Freeman emphasizes that Platzer's train-
ing is based on a four year program.
“Veronika has had only one year of in
telligent training. what we particularly
want to work on are her weaknesses.”

Coach Freeman also emphasizes the
contribution Platzer has made to the rest
of the team, pointing out that "Veronika
gives the others inspiration and sets a good

example. She talks to them about what
they’re doing and encourages them during
competition."

Although Platzer has successfully mixed
athletics and academics at Grinnell, she
still discusses the possibility of translerr»
mg to California Polytechnic State Univer»
Sity in San Louis-Obispo, Calif, a major
track power

“They have been the national division
champions in track and field for the past
four years and also have a fanmstic
coach,” explains Platzer

She continues, “The ony reason i would
transfer, though, wuiild be for the
athletics. Right now it's all uncertain.
since I don’t want to forfeit the academics
here at Grinnell.”

Wherever she continues her athletic
and academic careers, Platzer will pursue
an ambitious goal- the 1933 Olympic
Games. ‘

“The games are a realistic goal," she
ventures, "but i first need to decide upon
my collegiant route » maybe Wln the
NCAA Championship."
