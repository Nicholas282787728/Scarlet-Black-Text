Civil Defense
expert blasts
evac. policy

by Eric Green .
' There is an increased fear among the
public that top government officials
believe that nuclear war is a viable
defense option

President Carter's advocation of the
neutron bomb and Defense Secretary
Casper Weinberger's comments on “winnr
ing' nuclear war have fueled this anxiety.

Another source of fear has been the
renewed emphasis on ciVll defense Civil
defense. methods of surviving a nuclear
war. was heavily stressed during the ’50:
and ‘605 when USeSoviet difference ap»
peared quite pronounced. In the '705,
however, civil defense were presented as
little more than naive myth.

Robert Fledler, who visited Grinnell last
Friday, resigned his post as Cwil Defense
coordinator of Muscatine County last
December because of President Reagan‘s
new policy of Crisis Relocation Planning
(CR?) and its implication that nuclear
war can be survived. Since then, he has
been a fullrtime organizer for Ground Zero
Muscatine, a group promoting disarmar
ment,

Fiedler stated that he enjoyed his job as
a Civil Defense Coordinator until 1981
when Reagan issued the CPR document of
more than 1000 pages which outlined pro-
cedures for immediate evacuation by
automobile of every urban area in the
country The local coordinators are forced
to comply with the directive because tnuch
of their budget (50%, in the case of
Muscatine) comes from the federal
government, which threatened to refuse
funds to areas failing to cooperate

The CRP directive changed Fledler's job
overnight, Prior to 1981 his office was
primarily concerned with preparation for
natural and man-made disasters Such as
floods, tornados, or tOXic waste spills, He
said, “The tilne spent on CRP rose to 50* "
Previously, the time spent was "negligir
ble "

Fiedler charged that, from a practical
standpoint, CRP will not work. In addition,
the "allowable losses” conceded by the
plan are intolerable to Fiedler on moral
grounds.

The “best case‘ scenario of the report, in
which everything went according to plan
(Le, everyone had a full tank of gas and
there were no ilat tires, etc.i, acceptable
losses would be 20% of the population 7
over 40 million people. Fiedler believes

CSL dance policy
put into print

by Jeff Raymond

The classenight dance policy that
previously extsted in nonwritten form,
broken when the Shakin' Pyramids ap-
peared earlier this semester, was finally
drafted and unanimously approved last
week by the Committee on student Life.

The five-part policy stipulates- one
dance on Sunday through Thursday nights
allowed per semester: such dances may be
held only in North Lounge: dances may
begin no earlier than 9.30 p m. and end no
later than 11:30: the Forum staff must be
notified at least one week in advance of a
dance: any exceptions to this policy must
be approved by the CSL.

Problems with the old policy arose inoste
ly as a result of an unawareness of its ex-
istence by Concerts Chair Daniel Klatz and
Acting Forum Directors Kine Ruth and
Tom Crady,

The event escaped the attention of Jim
Tederman, dean of student aft-airs, until
after the fac Said Tederman, “It caught
me by surpi " He then reiterated the
dance policy but said, “You won‘t find that
policy in the Handbook, but it has always
been here,”

Klatz countered, “I didn‘t understand it
as a policy because if I had we wouldn't
have had the dance anyway."

He went on to explain his objections to
the policy on three main points. First was
his claim that the administrative policy,
which disallowed only dances on class
nights but not other entertainment events,
made an inherent "value judgment" on
the form of acceptable entertainment

Argued Klatz, "I can't see why the
students themselves can't decide what to
see." He maintained that funds for enter-
tainment were given to the students, and
students should decide how to spend them.

The second point of objection was that
the events simply do not occur that often.

 

“Just inherent that ‘they're on a
weeknight. . . means that they're not going
to happen all the time," Klatz said He ex-
plained that the Shakin' Pyramids could
only appear on that Tuesday, and he felt
that their presence warranted a break
from the tradition of not scheduling dances
then

Klatz‘s third point_ addressed
Tederman's contention that dances en-
courage drinking among the students
"Whatevei hey want to do afterwards is
'up to them," he argued. He later said. "I
don‘t think that the nature of a dance in
North Lounge facilitates any special ace
tiVity except maybe getting out some
energy, and i think that‘s good,"

Tederlnan commended Klatz on his
reluctance to schedule dances on
\veeknights, but reiterated his feelings on a
policy restricting or banning such events,
saying, “For us to say thatyou wouldn't do
it is no guarantee that it won't happen in
the future," when another concerts chair
takes over.

Another concern raised by Tederman at
the meeting was that his disagreement
with Klatz was founded on a
"philosophical difference," regarding
allocation of Student funds. ”We are first
and foremost an educational community,"
Tederman stated “I think we have some
rights as an educational community as to
how those funds are spent."

Klatz responded that he would agree to
guidelines but insisted on students rights
to spend money within those guidelines.

Before the policy was drafted, cone
sidcrations regarding time restrictions.
location, funding and administrative
authority regarding the policy were
discussed and finally agreed to by Klatz
and the CSL,

Relays funding
discussed at .13

by Jane Kaufman

The long-debated midweek dance policy
was approved by the Committee on Stu-
dent Life last week and by SGA Joint
Board at Wednesday nights meeting

Ex Officio CSL Member and Vice Presis
dent Mark Bradshaw pleaded \Vith Joint
Board, "This is the product of lengthy
negotiations. it's more than we were hop-
ing for. . , We don't anticipate needing the
flexibility we have in this policy."

The policy was unanimously approved
with no further discusswn, Bradshaw ex-
plained, "This will now go to President
Drake, and if he approves it. it is college
policy. if not, it goes back to CSL,"

SGA President John Moffet announced
that Student Rules Committee Chair Eric
Pedicini, "is currently typing the new SGA
constitution,"

Vern Juel, chair of the Finance Comma
ittee, began discussion of the upcoming
Relays by listing items deleted from 'the
Relays budget. "We took the prerogative
of deleting squirt guns, prizes, decorate
tions. protection tarp for Titular Head,
guest passes and cups."

Eric Secoy, off-campus nonscollege owns
ed housing representative, asked where
the money for Relays would be coming
from. Juel responded, "This semester we
decided to take money for allseampus par-
ties from the all-campus events budget,"

Bradshaw asked, “Where is the PA.
system coming from?" Bill McCullough,
co-chair of the Relays Committee
answered. "Usually Paul Cohen [Pub
manager] lends us one from the Pub, but
this year he got a new one."

Michaelene Kelley, offscampus none
colleged owned housing representative, ins
quired as to who would be paid sic per hour
for serving drinks. McCullough replied, “I
believe Pub employees have first dibs on
jobs."

Juel elaborated, “People that serve
must be employed by an establishment
that has an Iowa state liquor license."
Hafnes Hall President Pete Hautzinger
commented. “i expected to be paid for it,
and it's no fun."

Peder Fretheim, Loose Hall president
asked, "Where are you going to get 6000
cups if you aren't going to pay for it?" Me»
Cullough explained that Hardee's will sup-
ply cups and “write it off as advertising."

After the Relays budget of $1937.16 was
unanimously approved by Joint Board
with the changes recommended by the
Finance Committee, Relays discussion
continued under the topic of new business.

McCullough announced that Relays
Tsshirts and hats will be sold in advance
this year "We‘re having the acts screen~
ed," McCullough remarked about Titular
Head, the controversial "talent" show,
"We‘re trying to encourage dorm floats for
the parade."

Student Coordinator Jon Scharff qucs-
tioned, “Do you think it's a good idea to let
alcohol in the movie?" McCullough
replied, "We talked to Jim Tederman
[dean of student affairs], and he‘s opposed
to it, but we asked him to give us a

chance "
