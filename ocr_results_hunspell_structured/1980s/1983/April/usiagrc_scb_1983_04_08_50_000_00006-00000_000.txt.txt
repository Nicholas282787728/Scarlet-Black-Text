Rugby: Biggest sport on campus

by Eric wciss

"It started out as more at a Joke than
anything els ' said liar-icy Len as he re-
counted the hi y Ol rugby. "There was a
soccer team in the town oi Rugby in
England that was veri bad One day a
player became so triis ed that he picked
up the hall and started running with it," At
that moment a new sport was born

it took about 150 years tor this sport to
reach the tields 0t lowa. Nine years ago a
rugby club was torined here at Grinnell,
and since then the sport has been gaining
in interest and popularity. Two years ago
the team took second at the state tournar
ment. last year they placed ninth This
year they have a squad or 42 Grinnellians.
and Le“ eoniidently predicts, "We expect
to take the state."

"Not only do we have the largest team of
any sport on campus, but these players are
also the biggest we've ever had in my s ,
years here. We clearly have the best team
I've ever seen at Grinnell."

They‘ve had to overcome some
obstacles, though, "Each year we have
about 60 percent of the team who have
never played betore Dave Futh and I
«the two captainscoaches of the teaml
have to start from scratch and teach them
the basics "

The team has also run inlo some minor
problems beause the administration does
not consider rugby a true varsity sport.
and therefore the team only receives szotl a
year ior expenses. Although Leli retused
to comment speciﬁcally on this, he stated
that the money required to start a varsity
sport could be one oi the problems.

in addition to the large number or
players on the team itselr. there are usual
ly good crowds at the games. "We usually
get one or two hundred. We used to have
more people at the games. but then we
stopped serving beer. said Left ii the
men‘s teairi does take the state toul‘nar
ment, it Will be quite an accomplishment.
since some or the teams they lace are coin-
prised largely of foreign players who have
more experience. .

The women's team cannot claim to be as
toi-tunate as the men's The tlireoyei
cluh did not score it point in their li

years of play. Part of the problem is that
there is only one other rugby team in the
state tUniversity oi lowat The other pros
blein is that not many women are out ior
the team This year there are only l3
women on the team, since a rugby team
has to field 15 people. the women's team
might have to discontinue season play uns
til more women Join the team,

One of the team‘s captainrcoaches,
Janet Wilson, admits that there is a stigma
attached to rugby "When i tell people that
i play rugby, they ask me. “Don‘t you get
hurt‘" while she admits that. "There
aren't any sports that are rougher than
rugby. she claims that injuries are iaii-ly
rare.

"In the three years in which l’ve pla d.
there has unlv been one broken hon . nd
that was a lreak accident. Most at the me
juries occur during practice." in rel’ci-eiice
to why rugby is not a r ty sport, ii'ilson
pointed to the money tartar as one oi the
reasons. she also noted that on the men’s
team. about a [mirth oi the players are not

students.

Leii elaborated on the topic of satety.
According to him. both soccer and [ootball
are more dangerous than rugby, "Take
tootball, for instance while the pads they
wear are (or protection, they are also used
as weapons. in soccer you get bruised up
more. since the players in rugby don‘t
wear pads, they aren't hit as hard as they
would be in football," Lell‘ stated. Also.
since a player has to let go or the ball as
soon as he hits the ground. few violent
tights ior possession ol the ball take place,
it is a game in which players are constant
ly moving and passing the ball to one
another to avoid confrontation. "The game
has more passing than soccer and more
leklnE than football," said Left.

Thc men‘s team will open their season
tomorrow at Grinnell when they play
Newton. Whether the men's team “i" take
the state tournament and whether the
women’s team will even survive is a ques-
tion of lime Meanwhile. say. Wilson. "We
have 11 good time "
