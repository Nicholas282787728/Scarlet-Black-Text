SISKEL and EBERT

by Jim and Billy

If you saw Missing “at the movies" this
weekend, then you proably won't be in too
great of a rush to get down to the Grinnell
Travel Agency to buy your tickets to Chile.
There seemed to be mixed reactions to
Missing-s entertainment value, out it
definitely functioned well as a political
piece, bringing about many discussions of
American foreign policy and the like. This
weekend, you will again be treated to a
look at our lovely little government.

All the President's Men is about Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein's attempts
to uncover information about the
Watergate break-in. The film stars .lason
ltobards Jr., Hal Holbrook, Martin
Balsam and Robert Redford and Dustin
Hoilman as the Washington Post
reporters. it was nominated for several
Academy Awards and it picked up a couple

7 Jason Robards for supporting actor and
William Goldman fur the screen version of
Woodward and Bernslei 5 book. The
suspense builds over the film’s 138 minutes
to incredible intensity. When Redford is
going to talk to Deep Throat you'll want
to have a honey’s hand to clench or
something to bite on (hopefully not your
honey's hand). A couple of cute guys, some
great acting, a {asbpaced story — a giant
thumbs up!

Ride the Love Tractor

Love Tractor is a primarily instrumen~
tal quartet which hails from Athens, Ga. If
you‘ve never heard this group you
shouldn’t let the fact that they're from
Athens give you any preconceived notions
about their music. They're notlung at all
like some of the more famous Athens
bands lB-SZ’S, Pylon of R.E.M.). Saturday
night at 9:45 they will appear in North
Lounge. .

Love Tractor's sound is pop-rock with an
occasional hint of folk in the mix, a sound
that has often been described as “neo-
psychedelic." Most importantly, this
sound has strong, rather unusual rhythmic
elements which make it perfect for danc-
ing. ,
Critical acclaim for this band has been
strong. The Washington Post called Love
Tractor’s sound “unique. , . original and
exciting. . , as cool as they come."
Billboard called their music “Funky and
interesting pop-rock. . . a step up and step
ahead." And Melody Maker proclaimed “.
.,unpretentious flash, unpredictable im-
agination, and sheer shirt—collar shaking
danceability,”

So hop on down to the agricultural hop
Saturday night, where “the best in-
strumental band since the Ventures" will
bring the sounds of Athens, Ga, to lowa.

 

Film Shorts

The Classics of World Cinema Series
continues this week with the showing of

,Federieo Eellini's masterpiece, La strada.

Acclaimed universally as perhaps the
greatest film of all time, La strada has
been awarded over 50 international film
awards, including the Academy Award,
the grand prize at the Venice film festival
and the International Film Critic’s best
foreign film award.

Written and directed by Fellini, me film
stars Guilietta Masina as the tragic
Gelsomlna whose “stricken, clownrlike
face is the face of innocence," writes Peter
Cowie, “which so angers men that they
must crush and humiliate it, until they
realize that they have in fact destroyed.
their inner selves " Along with the
superlative performance of Masina are the
uncommonly excellent performances of
Anthony Quinn and Richard Basehort in
this Italian film. Though set in a circus, La
Strada represents Fellini's break with the
neorrealist tradition and thus is perhaps
the most powerful and poetic films of his
brilliant Career. Thus, those of you who
have seen such Fellini works as La Dolce
Vita. line, and City or Women will find this
film to be quite unlike the others It is at
once a gentle and powerful film which in
Fellini‘s words “is the complete catalog of
my entire mythical world, a dangerous
representation of my identity undertaken
without precautions." Indeed, I would cane
tion you against missing this film. Such an
omission on your part would truly be a
lass.

“State or Siege" is a tense story of a
political kidnapping based on the actual
kidnapping of a U.S. official a few years
ago. Piece by piece, revolutionaries un~
cover the discreetly concealed function of
the “Special Adviser" in this country, and
the director's portrait of the US. role in
Latin America takes shape. This is
another of Costa-Gavras' controversial
works, containing similar themes to those
set forth earlier in "z" and, later, in
“Missing". It is interesting to note that
Cosla~Gavras chose Yves Montand as his
leading character both for “z" and for
"State a! Siege".

The New York Post praised the
director's iise oi suspense and excitement
and rated the film as one of “inestiniable
value." The New York Times said, “A
knockout of a movie, a superb, enthrallr
ing, unforgettable film." Saturday, 0c~
