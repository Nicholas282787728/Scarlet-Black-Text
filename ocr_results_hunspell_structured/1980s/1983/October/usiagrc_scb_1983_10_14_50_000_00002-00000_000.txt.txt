The “Bitta Truth”

featuring Love Tractor

by Alphie Knox

When you're stuck at college in a small
town in the middle of lowa, and bands only
Come to campus about once a month, just
how picky Can you be about music7 Well. ,

probably picky enough to realize that
Love Tractors performance Saturday
night was. . well. . . boring, There wasn’t
anything terribly wrong with their music,
but the {our member group overlooked one

thing ~ instrumentals are monotonous.
Their songs all sounded like instrumental
iNXS, and lacked the energy that vocals
might have added, The group was not
visually exciting at all; in fact, the bass
player looked like he was railing asleep
(though he did have nice pants) This band
will probably be reasonably good some
day, but they obviously need more ex-
perience and, most importantly, a lead
singer.
