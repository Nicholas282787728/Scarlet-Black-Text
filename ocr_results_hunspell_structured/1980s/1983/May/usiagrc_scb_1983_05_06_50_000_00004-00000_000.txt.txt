The French Connection - (1971)

According to Pauline Kael of The New
Yorker, The French Connection is “a
hugely successful slam-bang thriller that
zaps the audience with noise, speed and
brutality," Essentially a documentation of
the tracking down at a large shipment of
heroin to New York, The French Connec-
tion has been described as an ”aggravated
case nl‘New York."

There are no good guys in this movie,
with a low-life police detective who cracks
the case Gene Hackman) and a ring of
tough but nonetheless professional drug
smugglers, The French Connection offers
two hours worth of slashings, slayings,
murders. snipings and chases. Fast-paced
and eerily exciting, this movie affords an
intimate View of the world's criminal
underground.

Based on a supposedly factual account of
one or New York City's largest narcotics
hauls ever, The French Connection won
the Academy Award ior best picture, best
actor tHackman) and best director, Don't
miss it!

Melvin and Howard - (1980)

A lyrical comedy about the “soul of
American blue collar suckerdom”, Melvin
and Howard tells the story oia game show
addict's life and his acoldental meeting
with Howard Hughes.

A true down~torearth American worker,
Melvin (played by Paul Le Mat) skips
irom one job to the next, always staying in
debt and never establishing any gainiul or
longstanding roots. Beautiful but dippy
characters surround him v a go-go dancer
wife, a dairy roreman and a lunchcounter
man are among those who add warmth
and reality to Melvin's life,

But when something really big happens
to such a “regular" guy, will anybody
believe it? Melvin first encounters Howard
Hughes on the beach — not knowing his
true identity, Melvin naively engages him
in an evening of downrhome fun, And this
is where Melvin‘s life becomes something
other than ordinary.

An exquisite film, Melvin and Howard
has been described as “an almost flawless
act or sympathetic imagination." One of
this weekend's best films, be sure to see it.

Born Yesterday - (1950)

A classic portrait oi the seemingly dumb
blond, brassy, vacuous Billie Dawn, Born
Yesterday is an adaptation or a successful
and hilarious Broadway play.

Broderick Crawford plays the man who
“keeps" Billie. He is a junkman turned
"dealer in scrap metal" in a world of
cartels. Afraid that Billie will disgrace
him in Washington, he hires a newspaper-
man to make Billie more “couth”. And it
works. During the second hall of the film
we see the new Billie, a stronger more in
dividualistic woman.

With expert periormances by William
Holden as the journalist and Judy Hollk
day, who played the role oi Billie on Broad
way as well, Born Yesterday is a lovely
film with splendid characterizations and
upbeat comedic moments, Judy Holliday
won an academy award for her stunning
recreation of her Broadway role.

Inexplicable Confetti

. by John Kerr

With the semester coming to a close, all
those ﬁnal projects you have been delay-
ing putting on, languishing over,
ilagelating yourseli for avoiding and
destroying your physical health in order to
complete are now due. Rarely. it ever, are
these projects that consume our time and
proportionate amounts of caffeine viewed
by our peers. But sometimes there are
courses in which the projects are not
always papers, labs with rats or bonding
agents, conjugating temperamental verbs
or doing whatever one does with quadratic
equations. This year's class oi directing
students is ready, well nearly ready, to go
public with its fine compilation oi inex-
plicable confetti. (This roughly translates
to: in order to complete the course work
for Theatre 370, students must direct a
one-act play of their choice and have it per-
formed twice before an audience. Yet
another example, of “easier said than
done "

There are nine one-acts spread over
three periormance times. (Please note the
change in periormance times irom those

The final play deals primarily with two
aspects of black culture; the role of women
and the Conflict of Views between the
educated and less educated within the
black culture To balance the serious
themes there are comic moments, a love
story and a bed imaking this the fifth bed
playl. Rachel Stelter directs a cast which
includes Bernard Jackson, Jr, Kevin Mcr
Clanahan, David Freeman, LaTonla Mar»
shall and Cynthia Bradley,
