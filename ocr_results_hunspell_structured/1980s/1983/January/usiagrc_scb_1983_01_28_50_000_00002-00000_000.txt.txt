No carrels to be assigned

by Kris Potter

Students around campus are expressmg
mixed reactions to the recent announcer
ment that the Burling Library car-rel lot.
tery will not be held for at least another
semster “I think it's a good idea, I think it
should be first come, first serve," said
ireshman Danny' McGrath. Up-

' perclassman Adam Burck, on the other

hand, said, “It’s going to be inconvenient
for students, especially those who use the
library a lot ..

Alter observing students registering for
the carrel lottery last August, Anne Kint-
ner, associate librarian, decided that it
would be best to rethink the entire process

Reaction to library carrel policy mixed

oi carrel assignment. Kintner believes
that some students sign up without ieeling
a pressing need [or a carrel, and she began
to consider the fairness of the process.
with approximately 400 people signing up
[or appoximately 100 of the 130 carrels in
the library, she said, “The chances of 507
meone really in need getting a carrel
seemed too small."

Kintner would like the Library Commit-
tee, composed of students, library staff
and faculty members to iorinally take up
the issue, solicit user opinions and “try to
imd a policy that best suits this library and
the way it's being used,”

She sees no reason to reinstate the old
policy in . the newly renovated library
simply to follow past convention. For the
time being. Kintner will accept written re
quests ior assigned carrels from students
with special reasons for needing a carrel
this semester.

The library was designed to accomr
modate over 500 students at tables or care
rels, “roughly one-half oi the student body
at any one time," she reported. when car
rels are assigned, Kintner assumes the
same policy as beiore will be practiced —
when an assigned carrel is clearly not in
use, other students will be tree to use the
carrel.
