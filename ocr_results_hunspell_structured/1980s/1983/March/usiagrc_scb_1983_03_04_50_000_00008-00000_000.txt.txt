Burling Rededication

Personal View

This thing
it’s painful

For reasons beyond the comprehension
of rational human beings (i.e., those who
know it is ill to rise before ll a.m.), the ad-
ministration (otherwise know as “them,”
rrequently spoken or with disdain,
lrightened ot Fritz Maytag, cholesterol,
etc.) continues to embrace its delusion
that anything remotely connected with
Burling Library (which, i am told, is a
place filled with books and water fountains
designed for dwarves, in which people
engage in an ancient ritual know as “stu-
dying") is of all—consuming interest to
those or us engaged in a desperate attempt
to achieve the perlect balance of alcohol,
caffeine and academics that will enable us
to survive four years in this sudden. wind-
scarred nightmare land,

Frankly, the Burling Library rededica-
tion is the only event in recent memory
next to which the final episode oi M‘A‘S‘H
appears an event worthy of attention, Dur-
ing the past year, construction workers
placed the architectural equivalent of an
enormous aspirin tablet upon the
building’s original roof, transforming the
first two floors of the structure into some
manic cross between a video arcade from
hell and a “Battlestar Galactica" set and
divided the basement into an intricate net-
work Df dark hallways and ominous. {or-
bidden rooms, which will someday be the
site of sexual and political atrocities next
to which the current administration of
President Neanderthal will pale by comr
parison. Now, the sweat of the workmen's
brows and the dirt on their hands having
been deitly and conveniently removed
from the walls. faculty and administration
members can parade around in their Sun-
day best, patting each other on the back
for another astonishing display or iiscal
excess.

By now rve undoubtedly attended a
number oi librarians, from whom i have
received unhesitant and gracious aid on
many past occasion. Those who are actual-
ly employed in the day-to-day operations
at “Mount Vigilance" are well entitled to

be pleased with what is iunctionally,
spacially and aesthetically an improved
building. The money allotted for the
rededication ceremony would have been
far better used to sponsor a dinner and
reception for the library stall. Such an ex-
penditure would be iar more admirable
and meaninglul than the pomp and
ceremony with which the administration
has surrounded the conclusion of the
library renovations.

Of course, such action would be a major
break from tradition. Lofty ceremonies
such as this week’s inevitable occur at any
institution whose employees are expected
to periodically wear suits. Furthermore, to
tout the librarians would not serve the
essential purpose oi the rededication,
which is to smugly present tor public con-
sumption another symbol or Grinnell's ex~
istence as a superior academic institution.

Despite such intentions, the entire series
of events becomes ludicrous if even a mo,
ment's thought is given to the history of the
renovations. The construction of the
library has inconvenienced studean for
over two semesters, the building was
reopened prematurely, and the linishing
touches on the library were suddenly,
hastily completed early this week in order
to make the building presentable ior
rededication. (It would have been nice, it
really would have been nice, it the
“men's" and “women's" rooms had been
labeled and handles had been put on the
doors before this week.)

Oblikus to such aspects of the celebra-
tion, faculty and staff members go about
the proceedings as if taking part in a
cocktail party before kindergarteners.
Secure in the knowledge .Lhat no one can
enter the living room (or, in this case, the
prints study room, which was opened only
for Wednesday's reception), and that none
of the nasty children will write on the
bathroom walls ever again, the par
limpants in these ceremonies are involved
in a spectacle that cannot be taken serious-
ly, no matter how seriously they take their
role in it.

Burling Speaks Up

by Terri Porter

Hmmm, they sure are making a big fuss
over Hus rededication ceremony. And well
they should. After all the trauma I've been
through in the last year, 1 deserve at least
a little compensation.

After all, I kinda like the old me. Now
I’ve got this funny looking box on my top,
and mey've been messing with my innards
for God only knows how long. Finally,
they‘re DONE!

This week has been Sorta nice, On
Wednesday, I had a bunch ot people come
in [or a reception and exhibit of the work of
the architects who did this to me: Weese
Seegers Hickey Weese Architects Ltd,
chicago (God. what a namel >.

On Thursday, 1 got a little rest because
they had some at these rededicatiun
ceremonies in other buildings tmy pals).
My buddy Herrick Chapel held the
Scholar's Convocation where William
Jovanovich, the chairman and chief exV
ecutive officer of Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, lnc., in New York, spoke on
“Looking for the Others." (Others? Does

he mean libraries'.l If so, I need to find this
guy.)

Last night was the lecture in Main Hall
lounge by Lawrence W. Towner, president
and librarian of the Newberry Library in
Chicago. His presentation was entitled
”Portable, Elegant and Cheap” Icertain-
ly hope he wasn‘t referring to libraries.
Alter all, we have a reputation to uphold.

Today was the big hoopla: the actual
rededication of me, They also had a
dedication of the Beth Wilson Noble Study
Terrace. Nice name, isn't it? okay, rm
jealous. She‘s new. and I’m over the hill. 1
shouldn't complain, though, She's not a
bad sidekick.

Tomorrow, they're giving me a break.
(Thank Godil'm getting too old for this.)
On Sunday, it‘s back to the grindstone with
a Community Open House irom 24 pm. As
long as I don't have a bunch of kids runrr
ing up and down my stacks, it shouldn‘t be‘
too bad.

Let me tell you, it's a rough life.
