This thing with SGA,
it’s painful

An editorial in a recent 5&3 stated that
since only four people had been nominated
for the position of president and vice presir
dent, it would be difficult to provide a
justification for this which “would reﬂect
well on the student body.” I, however. was
quite pleased with the news.
Perhaps U18 SGA is finally being perceived
as ﬁle bad joke it really is.

We held many SGA positions — from be
ing just another pretty face on a couple of
committees to being a member of the
cabinet. 1 also authored a report which
eventually resulted in a complete refur-
bishing of the SGA committee structure, I
became fully aware of the true uselessness
of the’SGA during the research for that
report.

The SGA has only three functions which
could be defended as being somewhat im»
portant: appointing students to commit
tees, dispersing student activity funds and
acting as a liaison between the students
and the big boys on Park street. These
three functions all degenerate into exerr
cises of futility upon closer examination,

The committee system at Grinnell is a
good one. Students have more input here
than at comparable schools. However, this
is in spite of what the SGA does rather than
because of actions taken by the SGA. The
administration would surely have student
committees if the SGA didn't have any.
Any political science major (and a few of
the more astute economists) will tell you
that a rulesmaking body needs at least the
token approval of those being ruled. The
current system does a marvelous job of
pr iding token approvals, The ad-
mi stration often presents proposals
which leave little room for compromise.
And besides, many of the students on these
committees routinely approve the ad»
ministration's suggestions while visions of
filled-in resume lines dance in their heads.

Some students rightly believe that the
SGA'S most important function is to
distribute the money from the student 80‘
tivity fees. However, in performing this
duty, the son is merely saving the ad-
mi 'stration a lot of work. After all, the ad-
ministration (and the majority of the
gtudent) don’t 'really care whether the
Fencers for South Africa or the Bible

Bob Kleine

Speed Reading Group is funded next year.
The SGA accrues no real “power” from
this service. it is simply bureaucratic
gymnastics.

Perhaps the most potentially beneficial
aspect of the SGA is the opportunity for the
cabinet members to direcuy convey stu»
dent opinion to the admninistration. The
powers-that-be of the SGA meet and/or
lunch occasionally with the powers~thatrbe
0f the administration, Unfortunately, the
only piece of wisdom that 1 could salvage
from these meetings is that Tederman
likes cream with his coffee.

If the son is so useless, why do people
want to be its leader? [noticed that all the
candidates wanted to make the SGA more
effective. Apparently, this can be ac»
complished by getting more students in—
volved in the organization. In fact, after
reading the candidates' positions in last
week's son. I began to believe that the
words “elicit" and “student opinion" had
the same causal relationship as “mire,
quited" and “love," “American Studies
major" and “free weekday nights,” or
“leftovers" and ”Dave McConnell.”

I don’t believe that the inherent
uselessness of the SGA can be changed.
The likelihood of the president and/or the
vice president making ﬁle SGA more effec7
tive might-be compared to the position a
eunuch has in a harem: he sees what goes
on and he knows how it might be done bet-
ter, but he’ll never be able to do anything
about it.

However, [wouldn’t propose the dlssolur
tion of the SGA. It does have some useful
functions. We SGA types do get something
substantial to put on our resumes. it also
gives some people a chimerical sense of
self-importance. And besides, eastern col-
leges likes Williams and Amherst have
student governments,

Finally, former cabinet members of the
SGA have had uncanny luck at landing
jobs with Arthur Anderson. 1 certainly
wouldn’t want to be responsible for
preventing our elected leaders from pursu»
ing their corporate careers.

So instead of calling the students
apathetic, I would prefer to think of them
as having better things to do than spending
time on such trivial matters as the SGA.

Mid-semester has crept up and kicked us
in the kneecaps once again. As always,
stress and worry are lurking about, ready
to pounce on even the most suspecting
scholar. Tests, papers, how we’re getting
home for break and the imminent glow of
finals in the distance plague students like a
swarm of pesky millipedes. Underlying
the immediate concerns of school is
another, less conspicuous, but all imporr
tent worry: that is, the deplorable suite of
international politics,

Some of the greatest minds in the world
today are attempting to solve the conflicts
that arise when nations clash, Incredibly,
they have overlooked the answer that has
stared them in the face from the outset:
golf. If world leaders would only wke the
time to improve their performance on the
links. this world would be a much safer
and happier place.

Here's a run down of current world
leaders and the maladies that plague their
golf games:

Yuri Andropov: Often chooses woods
when irons would suffice. Hence, he usual-
ly overshoots the green. The former KGB
head is deadly with a putter, however, and
rarely three-putts, Green etiquette sucks
though, as Yuri has a penchant for mark
ing his ball with an oversized vodka glass.
Terrified of doglegs.

Francios Mitterand: Often overswings,
resulting in huge divofs and a good deal of
embarrassment. Francois needs to relax
and swing easy, keeping his head down
and his left foot planted. Iron play is pretty
good; chipping is excellent, Putting sucks.

Margaret Thatcher: Club rotation is
nonexistent; thus, her drives are
characterized by a wicked slice that often
leaves her deep in the right hand rough,
making approach shots difficult. iron play
is marginal. Maggie couldn‘t negotiate her
way around a water hazard if she had a
battleship. Putting sucks.

Hell-nut Kohl: Europe's newest head
politico is rumored to have the largest club
selection on the continent. The corpulent
linkster has a powerful drive, but finds it
difficult to negotiate narrow fairways.

Iron play ist nicht so gut. nelmut cannot
get the knack of putting backspin on short-
range chip shots. Thus, his balls are con-
sistently rolling past the hole. Helmut has
trouble with pesky greens, Putting sucks.

Generalissimo FranClsco Franco: Still
dead. Caddies occasionally for The Big
Guy.

Meiiacheiii Begin: Phenomenal drives.
Tends to horribly overshoot parathree
holes. Faraway woods leave a lot to be
desired. Menachem often tries to oversw-
' , and thus leaves his balls lying in ad-
joining fareways. Iron play 0K, His eti-
quette is deplorable, however, as he never
allows taster players to play through and
refuses to yell, “Fore!” Putting really
Sucks.

Yassir Arafat: Drives are continually
short and marked by an incredible hook.
l-las difficulty finding a course on which to
practice, which may explain his awful sw-
ing and equally awful etiquette. Frequent-
ly calls upon his caddie to get him out of
roughs. Putting sucks.

Muammar Kaddafi: Drives suck.
Always in sand traps, Throws his clubs,
though he owns the most expensive set in
North Africa, Middle irons suck. Muam-
mar's swing hits the big wazoo because he
refuses to concentrate on a smooth
backswing and cannot keep his eye on the
ball. Short irons suck. The halfcocked
hacker couldn't chip his way out of a paper
bag. Putting sucks.

Ronald Reagan: Doesn‘t golf. Enough
said?

In conclusion, suffice it to say that world
leaders hold me key to international hare
mony in the betterment of their perfor-
mance on the golf course. A mere half hour
on the driving range and the putting green
would bring about miraculous changes in
the world political scene. All that world
leaders need remember is to properly ad-
dress the ball. keep the left elbow straight
on the backswing, keep their eye on the
ball and concentrate on a smooth follow
through— the basic ingredients of peace on
earth and goodwill toward men.

 

 

I’ll do it,,but I won’t like it

An interesting statement was made in
one of my classes this past week: People
don’t typically read newspapers to be
enlightened 7 in the best definition of
enlightenment —— but rather for amuse-
ment, or entertainment if you will. oh
sure, I agree that news concerning one
country having devastated their neighbors
doesn’t amuse me either, but it's the prin~
ciple we're talking about here. So what am
I going to write about7 1 hope to make you
aware of a problem we have here at Grin-
nell: bad attitudes.

Perhaps a quotation from Plumrch is an
appropriate beginning, lie once said, “We
should not be like misers who never enjoy
what they have but only bewail what they
lose," i believe this quotation to be perti-
nent for Grinnellians. Consider the fact
that every day we spend in college is one
less day spent making money (except for
the not-sooverly lucrative campus jobs),
plus each day is also another day of spen-
ding money to stay here. (Further
ramifications of this phenomenon could
probably be tackled with more of an
economist than myself.) So we, as
students, could consider ourselves to be
losers in the game. But on the other hand
we are gaining an education, a degree and
potentially improved personal

marketability. Not to mention the ex
perience we gain in dealing with other peo-
ple of both agreeable and disagreeable
natures. Attitudes toward our presence at
Grinnell, therefore, are an important part
of the interactions we deal with every day.

Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ”What
school, college or lecture bring to men
depends on what men bring to carry it
home in." Our attitudes and expecmtions
can be seen as the bands which make and
subsequently carry the basket which we
should be bringing with us to Grinnell.
isn’t it generally agreed that it is hard to
truly apply oneself to something which
turns the mental stomach? Much of the
poor productivity in classes can probably
be attributed to a distaste for the subject in
question. (Though let’s not forget the gee
nuinely lazy.) I believe here are two parts
to a solution: a better understanding on the
part of advisors of the interaction of dif-
ferent courses in different parts of the col-
lege in order to facilitate more effective
counselling of students, and equally as imr
portant, if not more important, being a
general acceptance on the part of the
students to assume more responsibility for
being prepared to learn, to make a serious
attempt at trying to get their money’s

worth, if you will.

i realize (as Well as anyone else) that
students need a break now and then from
the constant pressure of academia,
(Remember the cartoon accompanying
the strus series?) But how many of these
breaks do we need? Arent' some of these
breaks (spelled a-l-l—c—a~mrpu»s p-a-r i-
e-s) losing some, it not all, of their original
significance in their multiplicity? Perhaps
it is the spirit of the times which has us
depressed, which includes us in
Thoreau‘s statement that “a stereotyped
but unconscious despair is concealed even
under what are called the games and
amusements of mankind." Have our par
ties and “games” been increasing in
number because of an increasing need to
divert our attention from all that is hap-
pening In the world around us'! Isn’t it
curious that in reaction to events in the
rather impersonal world “out there" we
resort to rather impersonal affairs “in
here,” what we probably need are diver-
sions on a smaller, more personal scale; if
the world Outside is running around ignor-
ning each other, couldn't we inside work at
paying more attention to each other? It
would at least provide an answer to the
question, “Why am I here-z," and maybe
even reduce some of the stress that we
seem to have here.

On the other hand, maybe I am not one to
talk about parties, not being much of a par-
yer myself. But he pervasive attitudes on
campus affect me, die attitudes born of
the despair which, according to Thoreau,

’is an underlying feature of every beer bash

here at Grinnell. Here we all are at Grins
nell College, paying baskets of money and
getting depressed about how society is go-
ing down the tubes all around us and feel-
ing pressured and throwing lots of parties.
How shall we then live? Correct attitudes
are instrumental here, By correct at-
titudes i mean the attempt to get along
with the people we live next to day in and
day out; uie understanding that we are
students here at Grinnefl, and that pro
bably means studying (nine chances out of
it], anyhow), and the understanding that if
something disagrees with us, or if we
disagree with something, there are civil
ways to express our views on the topic. We
choose to be students in a demanding
school, and so we should understand that
we have also chosen to meet the demands
put on our time. Perhaps we should con-
sider the attitude that August Strindberg
advocates: “People are constantly
clamoring for the joy of life . . . As for me i
find the joy of life in the hard and cruel bat~
tle of life . . . to learn something is joy to
me."
