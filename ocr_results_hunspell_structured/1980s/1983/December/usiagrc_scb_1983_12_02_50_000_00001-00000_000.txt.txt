Twelvedays after The Day After:

Students survive Television event

by Ellen riekaikievvicz

The 100 students who gathered on
November 20 to View the ABC movie “The
Day After" in South Lounge remained
silent as they viewed scenes of massive
destruction following the explosion of
nuclear bombs,

During the course of the film viewers
saw the possible afterefiects of a nuclear
war, which they were told at the beginning
of the movie were less severe than what
would actually occur, Even so, Kansas Cir
ty is entirely wiped off the face or the earth
and mass panic develops in the surroun-
ding countryside as survivors fight for
their lives against the radioactive fallout,
and each other.

The movie depicts people competing for
shelter, food, water, and medicine, and us
ing any means by which to acquire diem
from each other, Despite the shock of
man's ultimate inhumanity to man
tnuclear wari, man continues, in the
movie, to place his personal needs above a
feeling of universal brotherhood

However, there are some hopeful
moments in the movie. A baby is born and
a doctor, played by Jason Robards, strives
to save as many lives as possible — life is
still sacred. Not to leave the audience com-
pletely depressed, the film ends with two
men embracing each other.

Referendum pldCes SGA under fire

by Brian Broderick

Will the referendum proposed by 8&8
Editor Jim Lyons and Concerts chairman
Dan Klatz to disband .ioint Board make
son more representative?

The constitutional framework in which
students’ views are expressed by their hall
presidents has come under fire lately,
culminating in the Lyonerlatz referens
dum proposal calling for a constitutional
convention to provide a uneavoteapera
student government,

Several SGA officers feel that a new cone
stitution and system of representation

After the film a discussion was led by
Professor Wall, Rosenfield Director, Pro~
iessor Moyer of political Science, and Pro-
fessor Wubbels oi Chemistry

Professor Wall, who began the discus
stop with some opening remarks, said he
could think of few coherent things to say ——
such was the “drain on [his] emotions."

He recalled 1952 when ”we thought we
were on the brink of nuclear war and there
was nothing we could do."

Today, he said, he feels the same sense
oi helplessness 7 the Cruise missiles are
already in Britain and will be in Germany
soon and there is “nothing we can do, so we
stumble along towards an apocalyptic
scene," he said.

He added, “I am mad as hell. Let's do
something about it. It has nothing to do
with partisan politics or national
sovereignty but SURVIVAL.“

Professor Wubbels was next to speak
He said he was “emotionally drained" as
well and said "we all want to avoid the
apocalypse."

The best way to avoid it is to maintain
“stability to keep the missiles contained,”
he said.

He explained, “The news is out on
nuclear weapons. . . there is not any way to
unmake that news,” He said disarmament

would suffer from the same apathy that
currently plagues Joint Board.

SGA President Jon Schai'ff said he’s
_not against the referendum but said he
didn’t think it was necessary. Vice-
President Pele Hautzinger agreed that
Lyons and Klatz “have a point" and blamr
ed student apathy partly on the fact that
“hall presidents aren't making as much of
an effort to be as representative [of
students Views] as they should."

SGA Treasurer Rob Sckalor said the pre-
sent System “makes an effort to be
representative and to be efficient.”
Sckalor said that “government is not on

Administration eliminates
Modern European history

position

by Owen Charles

According to Grinnell College Ad
ministration officials, a recent decision by
the Administration will result in the
elimination of a faculty position in the
History department. The decision made by
Dean of Faculty Catherine Frazier and
President George Drake to eliminate the
modern European history position vacated
by Mary Gibson last spring, followed in ac
cordance with recommendations made by
the Executive Council of the Facility,

Dean Frazier said in an SKiB interview
Wednesday that there were seven requests
for faculty positions made to the Executive
Council and that only three positions were
to be filled. Frazier said that requests
were made by the three departments that
had had vacant positions, East Asian
studies, Anthropology, and History. and
that four requests for additional positions
were made by Chemistry, Physics, Art
History, and the Religious studies depart-
ment.

According to Frazier, the requests by
Anthropology, East Asian Studies, and
Physics were rated above the others by the
Executive Council and the decision to meet
these requests followed suit. Frazier said
that the History Department had a large
number of pOSitions already (seven) and
could do without the presently vacant
Modern European History position. She
said that some modern European History
courses might be covered by present faculs
ty and also by possible replacements for
two professors going on sabbatical in the
next two years. '

Frazier said that the History depart-
menl is fairly flexible because of its size
and that “though this is not the ideal solu-
tion, it is better than to make the physics
o r anthropology department go understaff-
ed." Frazier said that “over a period of
time the balance will shift from American
History” and thus there will be adequate
coverage of modern European History

The procedures that were followed in
this decision were concordant with college
policy, Ms. Frazier noted. Department re-
quests iwhether for replacements or addi-
tional positions) are made to the EX'
eoiitivn council of the Faculty and then re

the students' minds" as much as grades,
and that most “people Just want things
done for them.”

5&8 Editor Jim Lyons said it. was the du»
ty of students to recapture the respon-
sibilities of son. Lyons said it was “on
behalf of students who aren’t pleased
about the representation" of Jomt Board
that a referendum petition calling for a
constitutional convention will be cira
culated among students.

The petition must gamer 15 percent of
the student body before all students will be
allowed to vote on the need for a constitu-
tional convention,

quests are “ranked and brought to Presi-
dent Drake and I," said Frazier. There are
ten members of the Executive Council in
eluding three non-Voting members. Presi
dent Drake, Dean Frazier, and Executive
VicesPresident Waldo Walker; and voting
members: Mr, Andelson, Ms. Atwell, Mr.
Christiansen, Mr. Duke, Faculty Chair-
man Dennis Haas, Ms. Michaels, and Mr.
Moffel

Asked whether the administration had
consulted students and professors about
the decision, Frazier said that depart
ments get a chance to make their position
known to the Executive Council and that
most departments are probably in touch
with their EPC'S, thus reflecting student
opinion.

History department chairman David
Jordan said Wednesday mat the reduction
in size of the department "limits what the
department can do for the near future par
ticularly because we have two members
who will be on leave in the next two years
a so that means we are down to a depart-
ment of five in the next two years,"

For the foreseeable future there is a
limit on our departmental curriculum as
well as our participation in general educa
tion, interdisciplinary courses, and our
rules in tutorials and the like to the extent
that we had been committed to those
before," said Jordan,

Jordan said that because Modern Euro-
pean History is the central field for study-
ing history, "We need a person or a slot
that would give us a person who is trained
in this field.” He said that the department
is currently exploring a number of options
and is trying to find the “least unattracV
live" option in dealing with the lack of a
Modern European History specialist "

SO far as Professor Jordan and the
History department is concerned, this re
Cent decision by President George Drake
Lind Dean Catherine Frazier is a burden
and a source of increased pressure on
history professors, and also a setback to
students wishing to take History courses,
whether introductory or upperalevel, The
future of the history curriculum will be
decided when the history department
policy is formulated by the EPC and the
department.

if the referendum passes, Lyons and
Klatz would like to see a constitutional con-
vention to change the present SG‘A con-
stitution. Lyons said they have "the
framework to bring about a new constitur
Lion" based on' having students vote on
amendments, rather than having a coma
mittee like the Committee on student
politics approve student resolutions before

submission to Joint Board. .
The model for such a constituional cone
vention wold be the townrmeeting forum
popular in New England. Under such a
system, students would come forth with
toili-si oi pay-z
