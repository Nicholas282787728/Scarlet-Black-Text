Carter garners strong student support

Senator‘s appearance proved a hanr
dicap. “I think that Kennedy’s ap
pearance on campus hurt us in an
organizational capacity. The support
of some of our members was cooled
by his appearance,” she said.

Stowe and Woodley feel that the

results demonstrate a deeper commit»
ment to Carter among students.
“President Carter is underrated, and
there is grassroots support for him in
this ward," Stowe said. “The support
for Kennedy is soft, while the support
for Carter is evident,” said Woodley.

The caucus also selected two
students, Bill Stowe and Steve Hart-
nett, to serve on the County
Democratic Central Committee and
the County Committee on Committees,

Anderson success overshadows Bush victory

by Robert Kleme

Almost one hundred collegians ven»
tured out from the liberal bastion of
Grinnell College to participate in die
Poweshiek County Republican caucus
last Monday. Little did they know that
this night would prove more in»
teresting than anticipated, due to the
unexpected support of underdog can»
didate John Anderson.

The Republican caucus was held in
ﬁle Veterans Memorial Building in
downtown Grinnelll The town of Grins
hell was divided into four precincts,
with Grinnell College in the first one.

The caucus began at 3:00 pm. with
elections for permanent chairman and
secretary being first on the agenda.
Gregg Edwards, the coordinator of the
College Republicans last year, was
elected to the post of secretary for the
caucus.

The presidential preference straw
ballot was taken next. Secret ballom
were passed out and later tabulated
and sent to the party headquarters in
Des Moines.

The election of twelve deIegates to
go to the county convention in March
was the next order of business. As a
slight change in procedure, each of the
nominees Stated which candidate he
supported before a final vote was
taken.

Of the twelve delegates elected, a
majority supported George Bush. with
Howard Baker getting the second
largest amount, Although Anderson
received almost half of the precinct

votes in the straw ballot. only one out
of the twelve elected delegates sup
ported him,

Approximately 85 of the 170 people
attending the first precinct caucus
were College students. The great
number of Grinnell students did create
some animosity between the students
and the townspeople,

Lyman Case, the chairman of the
caucus, stated, “We were tickled to
see so many kids show up, but I don‘t
think we expected them to try to take
over.”

Case was referring to the obvious
college support of Anderson for presi~
dent. Anderson did win overwhelming-
ly in the first precinct and was second
in the town due to college support.

However, the “power ploy” attemp-
ted by the Anderson organizers
ultimately failed as many of the
Anderson supporters left immediately
after the straw poll. This greatly
harmed the chances for electing coun~
ty delegates sympathetic to Anderson.
The straw poll was essentially futile
and the exodus of the Anderson sups
porters indicated those supporters
were hastily organized.

Edwards, one of the campus coor-
dinators for Anderson, stated. “Our
major problem was that we had only
three days to get everything together
and thus we didn‘t have the opportunis
ty to reach our potential."

Steve Elkin, the other campus coor-
dinator for Anderson, felt some
benefits were gained just from the
straw poll. He stated, “The story of
Anderson‘s success in Grinnell was
carried on the AP wires and did ap—
pear in a locai paper."

He also acknowledged that Anderson
carried Iowa City and the Iowa State
University precinct in Ames.

Ted Vlamis, the coordinator of the
College Republicans. hoped that the
caucus packing utilized by Anderson
supporters will not have a negative ef-
fect on the relations between town and
college Republicans.

Vlamis noted, “I know some
townspeople became disgusted and
left the caucus early.” While he
realizes this may not be indicative of
the entire town, he does feel that there
will be “many fences to mend.”

The caucus provided many par-
ticipants with an excellent first hand
experience in grass-roots politics. It is
easy to see how George McGovern
received much of his support in 1972
by making extensive use of eliectively
organized caucus packing.

The experience on Monday night
makes this observer more reluctant to
accept the results of the Iowa
caucuses at face value, simply
because an effective organization
could band together and railroad sup-
port for their candidate.
