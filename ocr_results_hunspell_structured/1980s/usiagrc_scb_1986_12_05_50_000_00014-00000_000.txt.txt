. Season’s Over, 7
‘ But Cross Country’s Just Begun

by Justin Lincoln

Although the Grinnell College men’s and
women’s cross country teams ﬁnished
similarly (13th and 12th, respectively) at
the NCAA Regional meet held at Wartburg
College November 15. Coaches Evelyn and
Will Freeman had dilferent ieelings atter
it was all over.

The men’s team, Midwest Conference
champs and yust out or the top 15 in the na-
tional rankings. was favored to do well, as
was individual conierence champion Greg
Evans But it Just didn’t happen.

The results oi the men’s race proved

even more to Will Freeman the power of
visualization. “We certainly ran the race
plan well, too well." he said “We didn't
run competitively. Next year this meet
has to become more of a priority."

But. as Freeman notes. the importance
of the Regional meet will depend on the
strength ot the conierence. “If we appear
to beat the top of the conference again.
we‘ll focus more on Regionals and train
through the conference meet."

The men were represented at Regionals'

by Evans, Dave Wisdom. Steve Piper,
Steve Harrold, Kent Koth, Phil Lefebvre,

Will Freeman’s‘disappointment was all-
set by wife Evelyn’s satisfaction with her
team‘s performance. “I hadn’t expected
that we would run as well as we did
because of the health and injury problems
we‘ve experienced throughout the
season.” she said.

Evelyn noted that Jennifer Bishop‘s per-
formance was especially pleasing, saying.
“Although she wasn’t 100 percent well. she
Seems to have recovered sufficiently
enough to run Well." Bishop turned in her
best time of the season “8:53) to llnlsh
26th, Dorothy Shearn also had her best
race of the season, \

Bishop’s time was only two seconds
slower than Shavaun Adams fourth-place,
nationaquualilying time last year, which
Freeman notes is indicative of the much
improved Regional competition,
“Although our team finish only showed us
to be 12th. that is among the top teams in
the‘nation.”

The remainder of the women‘s squad
consisted of Beth Powers, Ingrid Hutter,
Mary Lea Crawley, and Marianne
Carlson,

With the ‘86 season behind them, both
teams are already looking ahead to 1937,
The women lost four seniors, including
Nos, l and 2 Adams and Bishop. along with
Carlson and l-lutter.

Despite the losses. Freeman remains en-r

couraged in her outlook for next year:
“We have quite a low talented runners
returning. If we stay healthy, I think we‘ll
have a competitive team,”

Graduation claims 5 seniors on the
men‘s team->3 in the top to. including Har-
rold. Wisdom, and Letebvre. The other
two are Elliot Spagat and Andy Huestis.

wiui recruiting coming along “really
well". according to Freeman, and with
most of the pack returning, '37 looks to be a
continuation of the success the men eXr
perienced this year. which Freeman calls
“certainly one of the best years in cross
country history at Grinnell,"

“The difrerence' (between this team and
past ones) is that these runners believe
they're going to be successful. and they've
really begun to tap their potential.”
