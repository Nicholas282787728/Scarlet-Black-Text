Challenging the Myths About Asians

 

By Jillian Kong

Grinnell’s ﬁrst symposium on
Asian-Americans i titled “Chal-
lenging the Myths” *was held last

scholarship. In a reading from his
most recentbook, Strangersme a

L Dt'ﬂ‘erent Shore, he attempts to re-

week, with speakers and ﬁlms ad- ,

dressing such stereotypes as “the
homogeneous people with the ‘ﬂat
proﬁle,m the ”model minority" and
the “enemy invasion.”

The symposium began with a
presentation by Renee Tajima on
stereotypes in ﬁlm, and a critique of
the modern American movie por-
trayal of Asians. Tajima, who got an
Academy Award nomination for her
documentary, Who Killed Vincent
Chin.7, discussed the characteriza-
tion of the insipid and libidinous
Japanese exchange student in Six-
teen Candler, the reduction of Chi»
natown residents to a confused mob
in The Year of the Dragon, and the
one~dimensional aspect of Fu Man
Chu as opposed to that of other Hol-
lywood nemeses,

Featured Wednesday was Alamo
Bay, a ﬁlm about the racistbacklash
surrounding the establishment of a
community of Southeast Asian refu-
gees in asmall Texas fishing town. It
explored something of the culture
and background of the itinerant
community and also gave a detailed
depiction of the development of the
tension between the community and
the white townspeople,

Ronald Takaki, professor of eth-
nic studies at Berkeley, gave three
public presentations Thursday. He
introduced himself with a short his-
tory of his childhood in an ethnically
diverse Hawaiian town, his surprise
at being considered a “foreign stu-
dent" at Wooster College, his en-
lightenment about America’s multi-
cultural history through his work in

Ron Takaki.

African American studies, the radi-
calism that led to the developmentof
Berkeley's department of Ethnic
Studies and the reactionary racism
Asians are experiencing now. In his
convocation lecture, he attributed
this backlash to irresponsiblity from
the media, public personalities, and

cover Asian American history in all
its diversity, However, his final
committrnent, a talk on Asian~Black
Relations, did not address relations
between the groups so much as it
called for more pluralism in educa—
tion,

The symposium ended with a
presentation by Grace Tsuang, With
chans and figures, she showed that
the number of Asian students admit-
ted to Ivy League schools is not
appropriate to the increase in the
size of the applicantpool. She atuib-
uted this disparity to the popular
idea that Asian students have “ﬂat
profilm" —that is, no extraordinary
talents or outside interests.

The symposium was sponsored
by All Students Interested in Asia,

the Rosenfield program, and the

ofﬁces of PresidentDrake, Minority
Aﬂ‘airs and Student Affairs.

son of an Iowa harness maker, to
center stage during America’s most
daunting economic and military
battles.

The 90-minute ﬁlm explains why
this one man’s unshakable belief in
America and in public service to the
nation was so vital to his generation
and beyond,

In a 1986 article for The New
York Times, Newton wrote, “To the
modem breed of White House ad~
visers, Mr, Hopkins must seem a
pathetic loser, He arrived in Wash
ington at the age of 43 and for the
next 12 years his salary was lower
than it had been before he came. He
once unsentimcntally described his
love of his country to students at
Grinnell College, his alma mater.

“‘Nothing must happen to it,‘ he
said ‘and those of us who get a
chance, and many ofus will because
of the things this nation has done for
us, should and will be motivated
when the time comes to serve it
well.”

“He did serve it well and no one
since — not Michael Deaver, Henry
A. Kissinger, Hamilton Jordan, Bill
Moyers — was as close to a Presi-
dent as ML Hopkins was from 1937
to 1945, He was deputy president,
chief of staff and national security
adviser all rolled into one.”

Hopkins was born in Sioux City
on August 17. 1890. He died on
January 29, 1946, after a long ill-
ness.

His ashes are interred in Hazel-
wood Cemetery in Grinnell, wherea
simple gravestone bears the legend:

Harry Lloyd Hopkins
1890 1946

Aspccial showing of the Hopkins
documentary will be presented at
7:30 pm. in North Lounge of the
Forum. Professor Alzin Jones will
introduce the film.

Grinnell’s faculty passedaresolu-
tion Monday vowing support for an
exchange program between Grin-
nell and NanjingUniversity in China
— but not Without major debate.

The resolution, which said “the
faculty supports a continuation of
the college‘s educational exchanges
withNanjing University," passed the
meeting by a vote of 27 to 16.

Under the Nanjing exchange, two
recent Grinnell graduates spend a
year teaching English in a Nanjing
high school while a professor from
Nanjing University spends the year
teaching at Grinnell.

The resolution was drawn up by
Don Smith and Robert Grey to af-
firm support for the exchange pro-
gram after the Chinese govemment‘s
brutal crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing this sum-
mer.

An amendment to the resolution
warned that Grinnell should be
“watchful, lest these exchanges,
when carried on in an inhumane and

tied at $7,700,

Noyce will share the award with
Jack Kilby. Kilby and Noyce, work-
ing separately in the late 1950s,
invented the semiconductor chip.

Noyce graduated Phi Beta Kappa
from Grinnell College in 1949 with
degrees in physics and mathematics,
and went on toget aPh,D. in physics

Technology in 1953.

Noyce made the basic discoveries
leading to the invention of the inte
grated circuit, the basic component
that made the computer revolution
possible, His design was the ﬁrst to
propose the use of silicon, which
immediately set the standard for the
industry,

He founded the Intel Corporation,
the country’s major computer chip
manufacturer, with Gordon E, Moore
in 1968. In 1988, he was appointed
chief executive officer of Sematech,
a consortium of US computer
manufacturers designed tokeep U,S.
computer design at the vanguard of
world technology.

Noyce was awarded the National
Medal of Technology by President
Reagan in 1987, and the National
Medal of Science from President
Carter in 1980.

Noyce has been a member of the
college‘s board of Lrustccs since 1963
and served aschairman from 1966 to

odds with the ideals that first in-
formed them."

Morris Parslow expressed dissat-
isfaction with the amendment and
proposed a new one which would
support the program only if the
Chinese authorities could guarantee
that Grinnell students and faculty
would enjoy the same academic
freedoms at Nanjing University that
they enjoy at home. The amendment
also stipulated that Chinese faculty
and surdents must not fear reprisal
for anything that could be lawfully
said or done in the United States.

“We refuse to compromise with
anti-Semitism, sexism, racism,"
Parslow said, “Why should we
compromise with intellectual slav-
ery'!"

Andrew Hsieh said that when he
spoke to the 1989 Grinnell graduates
teaching in Nanjing, they indicated
no impediments to their teaching, '

Parslow’s amendment was de-
feated.
