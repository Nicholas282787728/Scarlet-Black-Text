vlncxal llle style at Milford. [needed a new
challenge. and believe that I can easily
adapt my high-school coaching abilities to
the roughrand-tumble play of Division t
Midwest Conference basketball. Also,
Grinnell offered me a chance to focus in on
one sport, which will free my time to-pur~
sue scholarly hoops research.

Clxarlalun llzlck:

emulate any one coach in particular. butt

line them up against the wall and have
them shot — along wlth all the phonies who
like small children,'big puffy white clouds,

send them off on a Chicago subway train.

put down the blanket, the radio, grabbed a
trisbee, but I can't seem to tit in. My physi»
nue Just isn't adapted to shorts, and I don't
look god in sunglasses Besides. I‘m not
that good at frtsbee. and I can feel the cold
stares of everybody else out there on the
field. I feel their cold stares. and my
t’risbeethrowing becomes worse, so they
stare more. and l gct worse at frisbee.
Don't you see? It's a sell perpetuating cy
ole of paranoia.

And l've tried lounging outside or the
Forum. drinking In the spring air. partak-
ing at that warm springtime triendship so
many seem to enJoy, but I don't really
know anybody outside the Forum, I can‘t

just feel out at place and uncomfortable.
At least that's the Way 1 picture it It’s kind
or a melodramatic viewpoint. but please,
humor me I realize that most people pro

everyone out there in iron: of the Forum
despises me and wants to get me, No one
has told me personally that he hates me,
but i can't help sensing a little hostility in
the air.

And I've even tried going on GORP bike
trips to Rock Creek. but I don't know
anybody in GORP and I don't fit in at state
parks The animals make me uneasy, and
the grass is full of itchy twigs and bugs.
People stare. The park rangers stare. The
animals stare.

I've tried going inside. too, but 1 just
don‘t seem to ill in indoors. l plop down in
to a Chair, pick up a good book. but I don’t
think I‘m the indoor type My physique
just isn't adapted to the inside of a
building People stare. they can tell, 1 just
don‘t fit in indoors,

Of Course. I know I'll oilend someone —
the sprlngrlovers. the GORP campers, the
hikers. the Audubon enthusiasts ~ but I've
learned that there’s nothing I can say this
week that I Won't be able to take back next
week

So tar. the spring has been so abysmal
that I'm sertous_ considering going on a
vacation elsewhere. I have two tickets to
Tahiti in my back pocket This is called
”keepng your options open." Hell.
someplace else, I might even enjoy the
spring. And t know I won‘t have that pme
