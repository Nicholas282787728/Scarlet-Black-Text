Where ltas all the newspaper
gone, long time passing?

Where has all are white paper
gone, long time ago?

Where has all the colored paper
gone. it‘s gone to landﬁlls,
every one.

When will we ever learn?

The sooner we learn, the better

paper means that more compdnles
will begin buying old paper to re-

ask yourself, “DO I
NEED THIS?" Are

 

 

thousand tons of paper
from Brazil. And every ton costs
17 pulp trees. Whether for paper,
beef, or some other purpose. at-
ready half of the world’s rain for-
ests have been cut down, and cur-
rent rates will lead to the loss of all
rain forests by the year 2050.
Recycling paper necessitates
ﬁve times as many jobs as virgin-
paper production. In addition, it
uses halfthe energy, halfthe water,
and leads to one-quarter the air
pollution and two-thirds the water
pollution,

Isn’t lhatenough to motivate us
to recycle ALL OUR SHEET PA-
PER? Whataboutconvenience? Is
thata factor? Even if it has been,
inconvenience is on the verge of
extinction. Starting tomorrow
there’ll be boxes all over campus
for colored and white paper to be
recycled,rightalongsidethe news-
paper boxes. L
