Book on

Russian

Revolution offers

workers’

by Ron Leinen

Daniel H. Kaiser, Rosenfield
Professor of Social Studies at Grin~
nell College, is the editor of a new
book entitled, “The Worker's
Revolution in Russia, 1917: The
View from Below.” The volume
has recently been published by
Cambridge University Press.

The papers that iorm the core or
the book were presented at Grins
hell in 1984 at the Rosenl'ield Pro-
gram Symposium on the Russian
Revolutions oi 1917. The book in-
cludes chapters by Ronald Suny,
James Bater, Steve A, Smiui, and
Diane P. Koenker,

Kaiser said that the book's
“most important Contribution is in
trying to help American readers to
understand the Revolution as
something that at least the work-
ing populations oi the cities oi
Russia wanted At least they
thought that in 1917. I think in
general Americans are oi the view
that somehow the Revolution was a
mistake, that it happened quite in»
dependently ol' the volition of the
people who resided in the cities,
That is simply not true." he said

View

“The overall contribution I
would say the book makes is an at~
tempt to try to demonstrate to
American readers, in reasonably
clear prose, that the Revolution
had a lot of adherence in the
Cities," Kaiser said.

Kaiser said he believes that the
tendency oi Americans to believe
that the Bolsheviks somehow
“stole the government of the Rus
sian Empire" iniluences the way
the US, looks at Russia. He said
that Americans have “imagined
that if only we did x or ii we only
did y the Communist party would
yust sort oi iold up and Russia
would inherit a kind of Democratic
iuture. That certainly depends in
part on the misunderstanding oi
the Revolution."

According to Kaiser, the idea
behind the book was “to get
scholars to boil down their prose so
that reasonably ordinary iolk
could understand it. Each of the
contributors has Written at least
one book on the subject oi the Rus»
sian Revolution. The idea was to
get them to abandon the jargon

and to iorget the exceptions as
much as possible and paint a
general picture. which 1 think they
have been reasonably successiul in
doing.”

Noting that the essays in the
book were previously presented as
lectures at Grinnell. He said ”I
think it is important to understand
irom the point oi view oi Grinnell
College that this is one physical
representation oi the kind oi in~
tellectual life that the college sup-
ports.”

“I'm proud to see the kind oi
things we go to on Thursday moms
lugs and afternoons lind a broader
audience and use.” he added ”1
think it says a lot ior the college.“

We used weapons like [machine
guns] and primitive weapons
which we could get in Pakistan.
in the beginning we didn't have
good weapons We just used the<
weapons which we usedior hunting 1
and the weapons which were made
in Pakistan in the bazaar, which
are really not good weapons, We
started fighting with them and
then later we could capture the
weapons oi the Soviet soldiers,

1 myseli was using is machine -

is a kind oi weapon we used ior
shooting tanks.

Aniiry:

it was guerilla-type tactics. Dur
ing the years since 1979 sometimes
it has been dilterent. For example,
we were living in the mountains
sometimes and the Soviets would
come there and attack our bases.
There we wouldjust stay there and
deiend ourselves... Except ior
that, we would just ambush the
Soviet convoys

The lighting is more like guerilla
attacks but in some areas where
the ircedom iighters are very
poweriul and have very good bases
in the mountains, the Soviets have
not been able to capturc that area
throughout nine years although
they tried their best during these
years

Scarlet and Black:
How did you hear about Grin-
nell?

nmiry:
when 1 came to Pakistan in the
winter oi 1984, 1 met an alumni oi
Grinnell, He was working with one
oi the voluntary agencies ior the
Afghan reiugees, He gave me the
address of this college and l was
very interested, 1 corresponded [to
Grinnelll when 1 could. ,,

Scarlet and llliick:

i know you were trying to do
something on campus 7 are you
trying to start a support group?

Aiiiiry:

‘ A support group. Yea...l think
next semester we'll start a group
because this is just the end oi this
semester

1 am doing this because it 1 could
get some donations and support
irom the people 7 because the
situation of the reiugees in
Pakistan is vei bad. They live in
very bad living conditions.
Children and people are starving.

tion They don‘t have tents in
Pakistan and the weather in
Pakistanis very warm In tliesumr
mer it gets to 120 degrees
Fahrenheit It is really difficult to

reason

The second reason is because oi
religion, The people oi Aighanistan
are Muslims and it is [religious
iighiiiigl that is enjoined upon the
people. the Muslims, whenever
they are attacked by non-Muslims
or invaders, they have to deiend
their country and their values.
That was the reason why 1 and
most Afghans chose to rise up
against the government,
