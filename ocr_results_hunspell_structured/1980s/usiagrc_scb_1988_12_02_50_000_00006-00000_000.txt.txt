Reader claims Roth
ignored Palestinians

To the Editor:

My attention has been
drawn to the inaccuracies and the
spurious news analysis of Ms.
Susan Roth's Scarlet and Black
article "A View from the Out-
side" (Nov. 18, 1988). Ms. Roth
stated that "the Israeli electoral
system [is] similar to that of the
British Parliament.” This is far
from being the case. In the elec4
lion to the seats of the House of
Commons, the electoral system
is based on pass the post system,
where the winner is the person
who gains the largest number of
votes in his/her electoral district.
In fact. Mrs. Thatcher (God bless
her) and her Tory Party (i.e,, the
Conservatives) gained an absolute
majority in the House of Com
mons despite getting lcss that
50% of all votes cast. In the
United Kingdom, the Social
Democracts/Liberals have been
demanding the proportional
representation as they would
clearly benefit from such a sys-
lem.

Ms. Roth in her article
calls for "a solution [in the mid
dlc cast] that will help the most
people and hurt the least," which
is very nice. However. Ms. Roth
does not mention, not even once,
anything about the Palestinians,
let alone the Palestinian National

subsequent recognition of the

including U.S. client states, like,

repeats the age old suggestion
that the "problems of the Occur

achieved with negotiations be-
tween Israel and Jordan, which is
but to impose a 'solution' on the
Palestinians without ever con-
sulting them. In this Ms. Roth
joins the galaxy of respectable
U.S. news analysts (like George
Will) who completely ignore the

the news analysts who write in
college newspapers today and in
mainstream media tomorrow will
not forget the Palestinians are

PSN member criticizes Kent's
opposition of grape boycott

To the Editor:

Enough is enough. For
those of you reading this, and in
case Mr. Kent has not availed
himself of the opportunity to
publicize his actions (Though my
impression of Mike Kent is such
that I think there is little risk of
this), I will provide a little back
ground on his latest endeavor. I
have been infomed of Mr. Kent‘s
intention to bring an action be
fore the Dinning Services Com-
mittee and, failing that, before
the Judicial Board. demanding
that Dining Services purchase
California grapes for the 30% of
students who voted against the
PSN initiative. This action is
utterly reprehensible and should
be a source of unending disgust
to the Grinnell student body.

I am sure, Mr. Kent, that
you are having loLs of fun writ-

Students
Sclerosis

To the Editor:

This year a new group has
been formed at Grinnell. Slur
dents Against Multiple Sclerosis
(SAMS) may be new here, but it
is a national organization that has
been active at over 200 campuses
throughout the country for sevr
eral years. When the prospect of
starting a chapter at Grinnell
came up at the beginning of this
semester. several students were
interested and wanted to find out
what SAMS was all about.

First of all, many students
might not actually know what
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) actually
is. Sometimes the disease is
confused with other disorders,
such as Muscular Dystrophy.
MS is the most cotnmon central
nervous system disease among
young adults, ages 20-40, in the
U.S. That's a category which
college students fall in, so it is
important that we have’a student
group like SAMS. The cause of
the disease is unknown, and there
is no known cure. What is
known, however is the way that
MS affects the central nervous

ing your little column and gel-
ting all the attention you have
been getting. In fact I am sure
that the attention is the only rea»
son you are writing it. I doubt
you have enough of a sense of
morality in you to hold any sinA
ccrc belief. But Mr. Kent, I beg
you to stop and consider where
your attitudes have led you. To
you the grape initiative may just
a fun issue to argue over. To me
it is much more serious. This
boycott was started by the UFW
to save lives, that's how serious
it is. People are dying. I sup
ported this initiative because I
feel a moral duty to take political
action on issues such as this, I
am not in this for fun. I, and I
think I can say the same for most
of PSN, am prepared to make
great sacrifices for my beliefs.

Now think about your "suit" and
try to understand how deeply up-
setting that kind of thing is.

Our society is very unjust,
You can ignore the problems of
farm workers, but leave it at that.
Just sit tight in your own come
fortable little world and never
bother yourself with anyone
clse‘s pain. If you must, you
must. But for God‘s sake don’t
interfere with those of us who
want to Lry and do something.
Don‘t take action to fight for
your right to oppress. For that is
what you are doing. This is not
a game Mr, Kent. So keep your
petty concerns about your right
to grapes to yourself. They do
not compare to someone's right
to a non»toxie workplace. This
kind of thing is enough to make
me cry. Corey Hardin

system.

The central nervous system
acts like a switchboard, sending
electrical messages along the
nerves to various parts or the
body. These messages control all
our conscious and unconscious
movements. There is a fatty
substance, called myclin, which
insulates most healthy nerve
fibers and aids the flow of mes-
sages. In people affected by MS,
the myelin breaks down and is

replaced by hardened scar tissue
called sclera. Many areas of the
brain and spinal cord are affected
by these sclerosis, hence the
name Multiple Sclerosis.

There are three theories as
of today that scientists feel could
be possible causes of MS. It
might be due to a virus. a mat-
function of the immune system
that causes the body to attack its
own tissues by mistake, or pose
