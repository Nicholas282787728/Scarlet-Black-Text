Both plays are rooted in the No
theater, which was and is the true
classical theater of Japan. and both are
normally played on the conventional
Kabuki form of a N0 stage. The Zen
Substitute is adapted lrom a kyogen, a
comic interlude played between acLs or
a No drama, and deals with ﬁle at
lempls of a young nobleman to sneak
oil and Visit his mistress without his
wile linding out. The Monstrous Spider
is about a demonic spider-being that

play of the same name.

Sate. artist-ln-residence at the
University of Illinois and artistic direc-
tor of the Kabuki Theater, has many
