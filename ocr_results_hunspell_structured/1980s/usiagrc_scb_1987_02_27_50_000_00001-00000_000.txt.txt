Archibald Cox interview

Forrner Watergate prosecutor on Iran affair

As part of last week's Rosenfield Sym-
posium on the Constitution and the First
Amendment. Archibald Cox. emeritus pro-
fessor of law at Harvard University and
chairman of Common Cause. Spoke on cone
tinuing importance oi the First Amend
ment COX is best known as the first
Watergate Special Prosecutor who was
fired by then President Richard Nixon for
refusing to drop legal efforts to gather
evidence concerning allegations or
criminal misconduct in the executive of

Solicitor General of the United States from
l961 through 1964. representing the federal
government in cases beiore the Supreme
Court, During Cox's visit to Grinnell. he
was interviewed by the Scarlet and Black.

Scarlet and Iihi

Do you see any similarities between the
Watergate scandal oi the Nixon ad
ministration and the current Iran- Contra

arms scandal of the Reagan administras
tton'!

(‘tixz

Both cases involve the White House staff
and its importance in making policy. Both
Nixon‘s and Reagan's advisors have a
great deal of freedom in that they don't
have any constituencies oi their own or
any established departments to answer to.
They don't think about anything other than
how the president looks in the public eye,
The situation is sort of like the king and his
courtiers And once you have a situation
like this, two things develop. One is an at-
mosphere oi secrecy and the other is an at-
titude that If it is for the boss |t must be all
right.

Scarlet and Black:

What legal steps have to be done to get to
the bottom of this scandal?

Chief Justice?

( ti\.

1 was reluctant at iirst to support Rehns
quist 5 nomination but I now believe that
he will make a fine Chief Justice, Yet. I am
still concerned about Rehnquist's personal
political conservatism reaching over and
aitecting his constitutional adjudication.

Scarlet and Black:

And how about the appointment of
Justice Scalia?

Cox:

There is no question of Scalia's intellec~
tuai ability to serve on the court, and his
conservative temperament will not upset
the balance that existed under the Burger
Court. I think Reagan made a good selec
tion considering the type of justice he was
looking ior.

case and the recent efforts to have the case
