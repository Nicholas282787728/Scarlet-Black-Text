Gaddis ordination in Herrick

“I'm getting excited," said Barb
Gaddis oi her upcoming ceremony oi
ordainment as assistant chaplain oi
Xirinnell College and minister of the
Presbyterian Church. The ceremony
will take place at 2 p.m. Saturday, Nov.
29. in Herrick Chapel, with Chaplain
Dennis Haas preaching the sermon,
Gaddis will be ordained by the Des
Moines Presbytery and Grinnell
Presbyterian Church Pastor Daniel
Ogata and two ministers from the area
will be in attendance. A reception, to
which all are invited, will follow in
Main Lounge.

“1 don’t think my life will change, but
i think it's a nice ritual oi support,"
said Gaddis of being ordained. Much
like a regular protestant service, the
ceremony will include Gaddis’ respon-
ding to the “Seven Constitutional Ques-
tions” and the ceremony oi The Laying
on of the Hands, a symbolic gesture in-
cluding the clergy and church elders
present. No of Gaddis’ friends who are
copastors in the area will assist in the
service.

Gaddis, a third year RA and assistant
in Academic Advising, thinks it is im-
portant to have people at Grinnell to
help with students‘ emotional needs,
especially since college students are
notorious for not being interested in
church. “I’m not real churchy myself,"
she said. “I'm not going to wear a collar
and it would be absurd lor people to
start calling me Reverend Gaddis."

”l {eel church needs to be meeting the
needs of people where they are, and

' what I‘ve been doing all along has been
helping students where they are They
don’t need someone walking around
with a Collar saying 'Hi, I‘m here to
help you'."

Gaddis said she had been fighting the
church and herself lor the past ﬁve
years to see if she really wanted to
become a minister. “It's a little uncunl-
mon tor a person with my qualiiicia»
tions to get ordained," she said. “But
finally I decided it was something 1
wanted to do and that for me a ministry»
is validated,”

Gaddis. who graduated from Carroll
College received a master of divini»
ty degree irom Union Theological
Seminary of New York in 1978, had to
meet strict requirements to be ordain-
ed,

The Presbyterian Chruch, which she
said believes in educated clergy, re
quired an M. Div. degree, a reading
knowledge oi Hebrew and Creek, and
passing five national board exams
which are set out by the church. They
concern content oi the Bible, biblical ln-
terpretation in the original language,
polity (the organization of the church),
worship, and theological capability. in
addition, Gaddis presented to the Des
Moines Presbytery her semon
“Wandering in the Wilderness," which
she delivered at Grinnell last year, and
presented to them a statement ol laith.

The Presbyterian Church has been
ordaining women since 1956, said Gad-
dis, but still less than live percent of the
clergy are women. However, the Des

.Ciould named coordinator,

Joint Board approved Terry Gould as
Student Coordinator in this week‘s hali-
hour meeting. Responding to questions
by JB members, Gould said she saw no
problems getting along with the
cabinet, and promised an overhaul of
the refrigerator rental system [or next
semester.

Alter four weeks oi discussion, .113
finally decided to place the four refur-
bished pianos in Cowles, Loose,
Langan, and Main lounges.

in other business, Treasurer Shari
Rauland expressed her dissatisfaction

large SI"

with the ”totally ignorant" statements
about the budget made by the Vicar
praidential candidates in their cam-
paignsr Claiming the budget was used
as a political tool, Rauland said the can-
didates took "cheap stabs" at it.

She stressed that she was very willing
to answer quesﬂ'ons or discuss the
budget with anyone, She was most
upset with what she saw as the
“misrepresentation of the budget" to
the campus as a whole in last week’s
5&8.

Moines are has more ordained women
than any other presbytery in the coun»
try.

Gaddis hopes people will not be her»
vous in her presence because she is
associated with the church. "My
greatest hope is to debunk people's idea
at what a minister is," she said. "l'm
not somehow more holy than others,
and 1 would hope that people wouldfind
me even more approachable,“
