South African government as a
“friend” of the UnitediStates. Brutus ‘
Said the South African government ful~
ly expects the American government
will come to its aid if its power is ever
threatened and so far the Reagan ad-
ministration has supported this View,

Brutus said, “On this issue, the voice
of South Africans is clear." They do not
want the American corporations and
government to continue to invest in
South Africa because this strengthens
and upholds the apartheid
government's control over the economy
and the people. as well as indicating at
least tacit approval or acceptance of
racism, He said, "We blacks are Willing
to sutter the consequences oi
divestiture. We are accustomed to suf-
fer and will endure further suffering as
a price for our treedom.” Brutus stress
ed that although South African blacks
have sometimes expressed disapproval
of divestment to visiting corporate
representatives, it is only because they
are threatened with imprisonment or
death if they speak of divestment
publicly

Brutus also rejected the argument
that colleges ought to be concerned only
with financial benefits and should not
take a stand on moral issues, the same
question Maytag brought up in his in-
terview. He said that by continuing to
hold investments in corporations clear-
ly tied to a racist government, colleges
Such as Grinnell have inadvertantly
taken the ethical stand ot support of
apartheid. He claimed that each in
dividual is responsible for his own ac
tions and by remaining in South Airica,

he is implicating himselt in oppression.

Brutus said, ”You must be aware
that you are not acting in isolation. This
is an issue being taken up by other col-
leges and organizations in other parts
ol the country and world. What happens
at Grinnell is a microcosm of the global
debate." For example, Harvard, An-
tioch. Hampshire, University of
Wisconsin and Michigan State have
each divested their assem from cor»
porations with operations in South
Africa, t’l‘hese colleges have not lost
money either. In lact, Michigan has
made a protit trom its new ins
vestments.) The World Council of Churn
ches, which had investments in all M of
the major corporations, recently
divested all its holdings and a major
Connecticut firm has divested 85
million dollars in assets.

A major conference on America‘s
relations with South Africa is planned
for May at Northwestern University at
which a major study on apartheid will
be presented, The United Nations will
also hold a major conference in Paris at
the same time to coordinate efforts by
all world organizations opposing apar-
theid such as churches, universities and
government organizations. Possible
measures such as trade embargos will
be discussed. Brutus said the obvious
implication is that Americans and other
world peoples are retusing to be im-
plicated in oppression and racism.

Finally, Brutus and Maytag have ex
pressed differing Views on the ins
evitability of armed conflict in South
Atrica. Maytag believes that it is un-
necessary and that non-violent change

is possible by working within the
government and the corporations
Brutus disagreed. He said that blacks
have tried repeatedly to protest non-
violently and have continually been met
by government violence such as the
killing of 1,000 student protesters in
Soweto in me by police. as said that
the government is adamant in its
refusal to grant the blacks rights. He
quoted the prime minister of South
Alrica as saying, “There will never be a
day when the black will be allowed to
Voter" Brutus said a student liberation
army is growing in South Africa and it
will win. It’s only a question of how long
the conﬂict will continue, for he said,
“We will not be denied in our aspiration
to freedom." Brutus Said that America
will in part determine the length of the
struggle and loss of lives by her deci-
sion whether or not to continue her in—
volvement with and support of the
South Atrican minority government.

Brutus said he saw a real opportunity
for Grinnell students to speak out in
moral opposition to oppression by call-
ing {or divestment. In an emotional ape
peal, Brutus said, “I ask you on behait
of the South African people to do
everything in your power to bring our
suffering to an end. I believe there is a
lot you can do and I ask you to do it."

Maytag explained that his View at the
moment is that ”instant divestment is a
cop-out," and that while divestiture
may be the end decision, it ought to be
the 1'0th of a “high standard of
thought." The new trustee committee is
expected to explore this question pro-
cess and produce a decision.
