What is your “buffer

days" proposal?

Jefﬁ' Fields

My buﬂ'cr days proposal as
it stands consists of two differ—
-ent approaches. The first ap
proach is to end classes on the
Wednesday before exam week,
so we have two buffer days.
That would mean that discus-
sions and labs would have to
end a week earlier, but 1 think
that’s something we can put up

' with. i think students in science
courses and language courses,
which have these labs and lan-
guage discussion classes would
prefer to miss that discussion
that one day to catch up on their
work. Students are given a lot
of work, and without the extra
days to catch up it’s not giving
the students a fair chance. And
one more lab in general psychol-

. ogy or a biology class is not go
ing to make a difference in how
much a student learns over four
years.

My second thing is, if buffer
days become something that‘s
unrealistic then I would propose
a dead week, This is where,
from Friday before the last week
of classes until exam week Mon»
day, there will be no papers or
exams assigned so that students
have time to do their reading. it
you have two exams on Monday.
an exam on Wednesday and an
exam on Thursday you basically
study for the ﬁrst two on the
weekend and start studying for
the other two on Monday night,

How would you, as SGA
Vice~President “increase
the diversity of the entire
College community”?

Jeﬂ‘f Fields

Approaching the situation of
faculty, staff, administration, I
would suggest group hiring. It’s
being done by a number of
other colleges. Group hiring.
Creating community for blacks,
Latinos, and also Native Ameri-
cans. Make them want to stay
here. There‘s no reason why
we can’t at least Work towards
that. If people don’t want to
come here, then that‘s a real~
ity that we have to deal with.
But if they’re missing commit-
nity, culture then we have to
offer that to them. As for as
students go, part of the answer
would be setting up scholarships
and assisting with ﬁnancial aid.
It comes down to paying stu-
dents to go here, make it a beta
tcr Offer. Other people I’ve dis
cussed this with don’t like the
idea of taking money away from
non-minority students to give to
minority students, if the non
minority students are deserving
I agree with that, However, i
do believe we should nvork at
getting fundsfrom the alumni,
from‘thetr'ustees, ‘c‘veli from the
faculty and administration so
that we can set up scholarships
to bring blacks, Latinos and Na-
tive Americans They arc the
minorities that are least repre-
sented on this campus, Also, the
scholarships should include fore
oign students. Because of the
size of our endowment and (he
alnou nt of moncy we have to put
forward and use for our budget,
l thliik there should be no rcar
son to any student to not come
to (r illnoll lirlh! or she wants to
and is accepted to the college

Vice-Presidential Interviews

Why do you want to
restructure the films and
concerts committees?

Rob Kiliion
I want to restructure the ﬁlms
and concerts committees be-
cause right now I feel that too
much power is given to the ﬁlms
chair and the concerts chair and

the person who does the books
ing. Now, I say that generi—
cally, “the ﬁlms chair and the
concerts chair,” because I’m not
referring to LeifLarson and Jes-
sica Mezzacappa. I think they
both have done all excellentrjob
in the position they’re in. But
no matter who’s in that posi~
tion, I think that person’s given
too much power in what stu-
dents will see on campus as far
as ﬁlms and concerts. I has
lieve the solution to that is a
lengthy one that I’ll try to make
short. Four of the cabinet meme
bers and myself went to Cor-
nell College and the University
of lowa to research their pro
gram, to see how they did it, to
see if we could learn anything.
And without going into details,
we did learn a. great deal. We’ve
written a tentative proposal as
to how the new structure would
look, and also without going into
detail, because it is quite a com—
plicated and detailed proposal,
it would create much more stu—
dent input by having a larger
ﬁlms and concerts committee,
by having a diverse group of
people on the committees, and
by having it be majority vote
as to what ﬁlms and concerts
are shown, rather than the ul»
timate authority resting in the
ﬁlms and concerts cllair.

What is your opinion of
candidates who run for
president or vice-president
who have no SGA ex-
perience?

Rob Killioii

My initial reaction is that I
think it’s very good, because it
shows that people who haven’t
been involved ill SGA think
SGA is a good forum for stu-
dents to become involved, who
thillk that SGA has potential,
as far as getting student interest
across the the administration,
So I’m excited that people want
to become involved. I think it’s
always a good policy, it’s always
great to have new people coming
into SGA with new ideas, new
blood, so to speak, who come
in with a sense of excitement,
a sense of “We can really acr
complish something." i think
that’s great, and I think that’s
absolutely necessary. My one
reservation, though, for some-
one who’s never had any SGA
experience immediately wanting
to become president or vice pros-
itlent, is that I don’t thillk that’s
a good idea, simply because,
many times, when someone has
never had any experience ill
SGA or very little experience in
SGA and they come illto one or
those two positions. they can be
the hardest worker in the world,
they can be the most dedicated
public servant in the world, but
it's imply a fact of life that it
takes at substantial amount of
time to learn the job, to learn
how to deal with tllc 't' lllll‘
tration, to know pti‘mllillltic in
SGA. t» lwcnnto a leader And
the training ground for do c, r all
oftllat is in Cabinet, it’s in it
Board, it’s in tllc lllllullit able
committees that SGA bids.

You say in your state-
ment that “the fact that the
3-2 proposal passed without
a corresponding increase in
faculty demonstrates how
little input the students
have.” How will you imr
prove that?

Tom Worth

That’s one of my ideas for
change right here. First of all,
the chances students have for in—
put are through their respective
educational policy committees
in each of the departments, and
the representation on the cur.
riculum committee. Now, rep
resentation on the curriculum
committee has been very effec—
tively designed. Three students
and they work together closely
r well, four students including
the vice-president. That’s set
in stone. But the thing thats
not set, and could be improved,
is the involvement between the
student educational policy come
mittees and the respective de—
partments. Some departments
and their EPCs have a very
good relationship; they interact
well, alld student opinion is well-
represented within the depart
ment. The EPC is a liason be
tween the majors and the de-
partment. And unfortunaltely
in a lot of departments they’re
not wellrreceived. They’re re-
quired to be a part of that
process of reviewing professors
and prospective faculty. But
that’s it, And some EPCs sim-
ply throw parties for the ma-
jors and that’s all. And when
those faculty meet in those de-
partments, they do not have
any idea how their majors tell
about it. 1 think that’s a seri-
ous problem, That’s very incon-
sistent. Some EPCs, as I said,
are very well involved, but a lot
are not. one change I like to see
is some structure for the EPC
involvement, such as some rec-
ommended guidelines to the face
ulty and students that the EPC
should follow. I’m not quite
sure how realistic this is but I’d
like to have the Epc have the
right to be present at faculty
meetings, maybe even have a
vote, or at least be present As
the case is they just meet and
then maybe tell their EPC what
they said after they met and de-
cided and that will be it. The
time for student opinion is while

their meeting. l think the fac—
ully should want it. They like
to know how their majors feel
about the classes they’re offer-
ing are doing. Wouldn’t they
like to know when they’re 011
fering the 3/2 how their stu-
dents fecl about it? I fcel that
if the EPC were a little more illr
volvcd tlley could have made a
difference. A lot more professors
would have heard student Oplllr
ion alot sooner and I hope would
have given more careful con.
sideration to the student situa
tion next year, now that they’ve
rushed into it so quickly. To
this day I haven’t heard a very
good argument about why they
couldn’t have delyed it a year
and worked with the trustees to
get more [acuity and then go
into it. It just shows that they
didn’t know ttldeilt opinion llllr
tii basically it was too late, To
relieve that Sitllitlloll, I'd tried
to provide structure for the EPC
invol/cment ill each ol‘ the (lCr
sartmcn s. H " ' ’ ' ‘ ‘

How do you view the roles
of SEPC’S‘?

Stephanie Redman

It’s vital that students have
input into curriculum, as far as
actual input they have, I don’t
think they have enough. rd like
to see student input on this cam»
pus increased a hundredfold as
far as curriculum goes, because
we don’t really have that much
of a say in curriculum. That‘s
unfortunate, because it affects
us so much. This as thing has
just witnessed that. As much as
students have opposed it, we’re
still stuck with it.

What is your proposal for
“buffer days"?

Stephanie Redmnn

Personally, I'd like to see us
have two full days, the week
end and two additional days.
Realistically, I don’t know that
that can be done. i think Ali’s
taken a big step in getting the
half-days. id like to continue
I still think
there’s room for improvement.
rd like to see a two-day minis
mum, but l don’t know how re-
alistic that is. I know the face
ulty is really dragging their feet
on that, and probably the ad-
ministration, too. rm not cer»
tain how willing students would
be to have taken away from their
break. 1 have a feeling that a
lot of students would favor that
simply because it is such an in-
credibly strenuous time. It’s
not just time to get caught up,
which is how I think the faculty
views it. It’s time to get your life
back in order before you plunge
into finals.

How effective are hall
senators as representatives
of the students?

Chris Gunst

They’re as effective as they
want to be. Two cases: Senator
A doesn’t put up hall notes, goes
to the meetings and just listens
and votes. That is not an effec.
tive hall senator, Senator B goes
around and writes hall notes,
and with something like relays, l
remember one hall senator ﬁrst
held a study break and then
went around door to door to
get opinions, That’s an effective
hall senator. When you have
that you have a)the s’ltdtllts
feeling that SGA is doing some.
thing for them and b)yt u’re gets
ting something from them,

How can you, rlS SGA
Vice-President help the
Grinnell football program?

Chris Gunst

You can go in front of the
trustees. I’ve heard one really
good idea from Dianna Ward,
and she was saying it in terms
of ARH and Steiner. You go to
the alumni and the trustees and
you ask them to donate money,
to buy a position. i think it
would work perfectly for a foot-
ball team. Buy a position. You
find someone who is academi-
cally qualified but doesn’t have
enough money to come here,
well a trustee will give him a
scholarship for his position. Ba.
sically it’s getting the people
who have money and getting
them to ﬁnance it. Also, we are
in the middle of lowa and we
have a black community of to
so, you’re not going to be able to
draw. lfl was a black prospeCr
tive, l’d say ’I don’t know ifl
want to go here.’ We have to get
more black raculty to help that.

would say on the average week
I spend about three hours a day
working on SGA related things.
As SGA vice-president. I would
expect that to increase, That
includes time that I have to
spend in meetings, discussing is-
sues with students, in lily oﬁice,
typing up memos, etc, I can’t
give a concrete figure because
everybody works differently. Ali
spends tons of time ill alid out of
the ofﬁce and he’s always work
ing on SGA, l have the ability
to organize my timc and I don’t
think it will run rne ragged to
the point where I can’t function
as a being, as a student and a
friend to tllose who know me.
But I do tlilllk it is going to take
a lot of time which is good ill a
way because I like what I’m do-
ing and I’m not unwilling to put
in as much time as it takes.

Stephanie Redrnan

As much time as necessary. I
have no idea what a minimum
requirement would be, as far as
meetings and that sort of firings
goes Ofﬁce hours as well, that’s
Five to 10 hours right there, Just
bciiig on campus, talking to peo

I’m not quite sure if it will

It‘s going to change. Some times
commiltce meetings are going to
be the greatest part ofit, Lately,
Joint Board has met twice. and
for two-aiitl-arhalf to three hours
each. That‘s six hours right
there, plus any other meetings
Ali would have to go to, like
Student Council on Curriculum.

and Curriculum Committee; so,
he could very well have been
spending 25.30, And in other
weeks, maybe towards the be-
ginning or the year. when meets
lngs aren’t going yet, it‘s going
to be less time. So, first of all,
it's going to vary. But just to
give an average, I‘d almost as?

it‘ll be exhausting. but i would
