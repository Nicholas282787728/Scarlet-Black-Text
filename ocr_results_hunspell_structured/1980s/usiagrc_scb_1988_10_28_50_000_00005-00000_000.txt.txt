The Human Element

I used to trick-or-treat.
Now I'm just a demonrposscssed
Satan worshipper.

It was a gradual process,
sure. but unavoidable given the
time-proven influence of Hal-
loween's pagan roots. How could
I hope to escape the secular se~
duction of the magic rituals of
childhood, or the early teenage

Jim Duncan

stage of heavy metal music and
Dungeons and Dragons? How
could I evade the temptation of
ghoulish slasher movies during
my high school years. or the in-
troduction to evil "Spirits" while
at college? Mine are the hell»
spawned powers born of bedtime
incantations and voodoo dances at
the back of my parents' closet.

I can turn my eyeballs in-
side-out and come really close to
touching my nose with my
tongue.

Powers like these are not
realized over night. My satanic
enlightenment began in 2nd
grade, at Barton Elementary. . .

st ts a
My parents were possessed.
"Yes, you are going to take your
costume to school," Mom had
told mc before she left for work.

We were to have a Hal-
loween party in class, then a pa-
rade througll tlle halls. All day
we did our assignmens citcdly,
anticipating the festivities. Ex-
cept me. My costume was in a
box on the student closet shelves,

with my Spiderman lunchbox. I
hated my costume.

I planned to take a note that
I had composed on the typewriter
before I left home up to my
teacher, Miss Trout. It was sup-
posed to excuse me from partici-
mum in the activities, as they
were in conflict with my rcli-
gious views. I signed my dad's
name on it. [00.

Actually, what I ended up
doing was sliding out of my seat
and shufﬂing up the aisle, paus-
ing for just a second to punch
Kelly Stocker in the head -— we
were a "thing." Miss Trout was
seated at her desk, marking our
math quiz grades in her green
book. "Miss Trout," I said. [in-
gering the edge of the desk, "I
don't want to do this."

"Nonsense," she said,
shoving a piece of orange con
struction paper in my hands.
"Draw a pumpkin." Then to the
test, "All right class, it's time for
our party!" Wild cheers. For me,
the ﬂaming pit of Hell yawned
wide, and I tumbled into its
smoky depths in my ﬂamable
Charlie Brown costume and plasv
tic mask.

I went home after school
and told my parents, "Yeah, the
parade was OK, and the cupcakes
were good." At4:30 I asktx‘l if we
could go triek-or-treating; I was
eager to do the Devil's work.
And to get ajump on the rest of
the kids.

"We wait until dark," was
my dad’s ominous answer.

Student Government News

Perhaps some of you have
heard about the "curricular re—
view" beginning at Grinnellt
The College Executive Council
(George Drake, Wally Walker,
Charlie Duke, Sandy Moffett,
Anita Solow, Dee Fairchild, Pe-
ter Connolly, Charlie Icpsen, Al
Jones, and Sig Barber) has formed
the Subcommittee on Curricular

Rah Klllion

Review to evaluate our present
curriculum. On a larger scale,
the Subcommittee will evaluate
whether our curriculum is
providing the education the Col-
lege Catalog claims it does.
More specifically, the Subcom-
mittee is reviewing both current
course offerings and the require-
ments structuring those courses.
The curricular review is
still in its very early stages. It is
hoped that the discussion can be
brought to a conclusion by the
curl of the fall Semester, 1989.
This time period is not, however,
rigidly set. To begin the discus-
sion, the Subcommittee has pro
posed a number of curricular
models, each of which would

ghost. The superstition is that
when a lady, having loved the
wrong man, dies of a broken
heart, her spirit will come back
in the form of a white hare to
haunt her dcceivcr. The phantom
will follow him everywhere, and
it will be visible to only him.
Ultimately. always on Hal-
loween, it will cause the death of
the man who broke the lady's
heart

While Halloween is cele-
brated worldwide. many countries
celebrate differently from us. In

Italy, on the night of All Souls,
the spirits of the dead are thought
to be 'abroad'. As people walk
the streets dressed in black, bells
are rung to remind them to pray
for the souls of the dead. In
Spain, once it is dark, nuts and
cakes are placed on graves to
bribe the spirits not to interrupt
the vigil of the saints, Belgian
children build miniature shrines
in front of their homes with ﬁg-
ures of the Madonna, and they
beg for money to buy cakes. As
many cakes as one eats, so many

souls are supposedly freed frotn
purgatory.

In Germany, if a girl goes
out and asks the ftrst young man
she meets his name, her hus-
band's will be like it, If she
walks three times around a
church, and then makes a Wish, it
will be granted.

Wllatever you do this
weekend, whether it be Saturday
night, and you are at the party in
Younker, or Monday night and
you are walking home from the
library, be careful. Don‘t let any
black cats cross your path. And
if you hear footsteps behind you,
make sure you don't turn around.
For if you turn around and you
see the spirit of a dead person face
to face, your hours are numbered

modify or replace our own.
Sandy Moffett. Chair of both the
Faculty and the Subcommittee,
emphasizes that the Subcommit-
tee is not limiting itself to these
eight proposals, but that the dis-
cussion must begin somewhere.
I am relieved to say that none of
the models proposes a rigid core
of courses. Most would either
modify the tutorial or replace it
with one, two. or three courses.
The Subcommittcc's overall goal
is ﬁnding a curricular model that
combines the best components of
our current tutorial~bascd system
with new components that will
eliminate any current weaknesses

As the SGA "Vice-presi-
dent/President of Academic Af-
fairs," I work primarily within
the academic sphere of SGA and,
therefore, it's my responsibility
to ensure students have a voice in
the review. I've had the Student
Council on Curriculum (SCC
has one representative from each
major‘s Student Educational Pol—
icy Committee) discuss the eight
curricular models during our last
two meetings. I then sent SCC'S
comments and criticisms to the
Subcommittee. As the review

We'll Keep You Posted

proceeds, Charlie Duke (Dean of
the Faculty) and Sandy Moffett
will keep me informed of new
developments so I, in turn, can
solicit SCC and Student Educa
tion Policy Committee (stare)
input. In addition, I'll attempt to
keep the student body as a whole
informed of everything that's
happening, How I do that (open
forums, campus stuffings, etc.)
depends on a number of factors
including how quickly the review
is proceeding.

Please don't hesitate to
Contact me at box 823 or X3625
if you'd like to discuss the
curricular review in more detail.
And feel free to stop by during
my office hours; I have office
hours seven days a week from 24
pm. in the SGA Offices. I
would also encourage you to cut
out the list of Student Council
on Curriculum members printed
near this column. In a sense,
SCC is the academic equivalent
of Joint Board. So if you’ve de-
clared a major, find out who is
representing you on SCC and
contact them directly with your
questions and concerns.
