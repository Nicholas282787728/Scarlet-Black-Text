Catchingup with the athletes

by Jeff Raymond

The Grinnell College men's swim team
trained in Forida over winter break,
iollowing the team's longstanding tradi-
tion of pilgrimages down South. Since the
team still faces two-thirds of its meee this
season, the trip should prove worthwhile.
Coach Ray Obermiller called the annual
trip a "major factor" in the development
oi past Pioneer teams. All but one of the
last live swim teams were conference
champions,

The team left {or St. Petersburg on Jan.
9 and spent the next two weeks in concen-
trated training sessions, The daily
schedule called {or two practice sessions in
the pool plus weight training and running.
Although there were occasionally pro~
blems, most at the time the team had good
conditions for pool work. Obermiller said
he would like to continue the Florida trips
as long as possible because not only does
the work keep the swimmers ready for
meets but it provides a morale boost
before returning to Grinnell and resuming
classes.

The coach said this year's team is strong
and has the potential to be as successful as
previous Pioneer squads. He mentioned
the Florida trip and the PEG pool as
reasons for the winning teams. “We have
the best small college pool in’ the country."

This was the first trip [or the women's
team but coach Martha Rowedder said the
nine days in Ft. Lauderdale were wore
thwhile. “We had a lot oi sore muscles the
iirst couple oi days in Florida but we are
now healthy and in good physical shape,

Rowedder called this team her best so
far in a string of steadily improving

squads. The quality or the team has risen

with the addition of a few good recruiw
each year. Rowedder said her sophomore
swimmers are an especially talented
class. Lynn Dixon, Penny Bates and Susan
Durkee are among those likely to
challenge for spam in the national meet
this March.

The men's basketball team returned to
Grinnell ior practice on Jan. 8 and stayed
in the PEC until Jan. 11 when they leit {ora
road trip to Transylvania University in‘
Lexinton, Kentucky. Although players
disliked returning early and were upset
having to sleep on cots in the PEC, Coach
John Harvey said the early practices were
necessary because of the late start of
classes and the number of league games
required.

Although everyone reported to practice
on time, Harvey felt the tour days oi prac
tice did not “gear” the team to {ace divi~
sion II Transylvania and iowa Wesleyan
proved too strong [or the Pioneers. Coe
College benefited from several Grinnell er-
rors and won by 15 points in the next game.
Cornell College also bested the Pioneers
for the second time this Season. The squad
dropped back-toback home games to
iawrence and nationallyrranked Beloit
before Classes resumed this week. “I
thought we periomied well against two
veteran teams that have outstanding
rccords," said Harvey. “We're continuing
to improve but it's very irustrating to play
as well as we did and still not win."

Nine games remain on the Pioneer
schedule and four of them are at home.
Harvey said that most of the better teams
on their schedule have already been
played and future games look better
though he will not say the Pioneers will
definitely turn the season around,

The women's basketball team began
practice here on Jan. 17 and had a week oi
practice before is game Jan. 23 against
Beloit. The Pioneers won the contest 7463
and tell only seven points short of Setting a
team record for scoring in a game. Bad
weather iorced the postponement of a
game against Knox set for the day before.
“The week in the mac was very helpful,"
said Coach Merry Ormsby. “I was very
pleased with our otiensive improvement

Ormsby Said that while the group is
relaxing more on the court and improving
team play, the deiense still needs work.
The team is young and features three
freshmen starters. Ormsby wants more
practice time for the team this year and
has cut back on the number oi games on
the schedules. Hall of the remaining eight
games are conference games and these
are especially important to the team.

Indoor track Coaches Evelyn and Will
Freeman estimated the attendance at
their early indoor track team workouts to
be 40 to 50 people and_ were expecting
several more latecomers to join the squad
by next week. Even though they will be
assisted by coaches Sarah Brichiord and
Bob Bengel, the rather large turnout oi
aspiring tracksters has made it necessary
[or the Freemans to adopt some unor-

Pioneer Relays in ore-Christmas action

Grinnell and Washington have had some
torrid meets in recent years, Washington
deieated Grinnell, 72-39, in a December
dual but Rowedder hopes her Pioneers can
reverse things this weekend. "We'll swim
more events this time, and our superior
depth should be a big factor." she stated,

The team will swim at home next week
in a quadrangular meet involvmg several
large schools.

thodox coaching methods. Men and women
are working out together and the coaches
are available to help anybody in their par-
ticular specialty. The coaches are hoping
that because of the size of the squad and
the coed training sessions, team members
will help each other out and become more
motivated in their workouts

The Freemans are stressing general
fitness for die athletes in the early
workouts. Then the athletes will train in
their individual specialty. Even though the
squad has its ﬁrst meet here one week
from tomorrow, conference rules state
that no indooor track practice can be of-
ficially held until January 15. Will
Freeman said that the rule would not only
dampen performances because at un-
polished skills but would probably lead to
injuries in underrconditioned athletes, The
rule is to allow students to participate in
other sports besides track but Will feels
that the serious track athlete is only
hindered by not being able to work out
under a coach's supervision Evelyn
Freeman said that she would like to see the
practice time date moved back as far as
the end oi the cross country season.

The PEC has facilities (or all indoor
events and while the coaches feel that it is
iar from ideal to practice and compete in,
they are happy with its accommodations.
Next week it will be the site of the ﬁrst
meet {or the Pioneers this season and
nearly ten teams will be involved in the
meet February 20 and 27 will also be home

compete in the latter meet.
