Christiansen. the Norris Professor
of Biology, has served two previous
three-year terms on the council, his

first appointment
coming when the
group was founded in
1977.

“At that time we
served as the gover-
nor's resource for
questions he had deal-
ing with science.”
Christiansen said.
“And in addition to
that we met regularly
to try to bring to the
attention of the gov-

Woman Is Attacked in Town;
Man Sought for Attempted Rape

Courtesy Grinnell HeraldrRegister

A would-be rapist was left slumped
on the ground in a downtown park-
ing lot Friday night after his victim
fought back, the Grinnell»Herald
Register reponed yesterday,

The incident occurred as the vic<
tim, a Grinnell woman in her early
30’s, left the Longhorn Restaurant,
on the west sideof Main St., at about
10 pm.

“She was accosted ouside the
restaurant and taken to an area along
the wall beside the building," police
Dan Boyer said in a prepared state-
ment.

”The assailant loosened some of
the victim’s clothing but was pre-
vented from furthering the attack by
the victim‘s self-defense tactics"

The woman freed herself by kick-
ing and kneeing the man in the
headand chest, and by biting and
scratching him. _

She then left the scene in her car.

her home,

A few minutes later, her attacker
apparently limped away toward the
west “He was having great diffi-
culty walking.” Boyer said.

The woman is said to have sufv
fered only a few scratches around
the neck and shoulders.

Because the woman was grabbed
from behind, she did not get a close
look at the assailant. Boyer said aue
thorities are searching for a white
man with a slender build and possi-
bly dark hair with a bald spot on the
top of his head.

The suspect should also have
scratches across the back of one hand
and bites on the two middle ﬁngers
of the left hand, Boyer said.

“If anyone observes a white male
with scratches to the face, neck or
hands, please contact the police de-
partment," he said.

Hesaid it had been approximately
a year since the last such auack was
reported.

agriculture, the problem of broadena
ing the crop base in Iowa, radioac-
tive waste disposal, the dangers of
nitrite: in food products and “came
out with research and analysis of
what the situation was in the state,”

“Themost extensive investigation
was on the issue of scientiﬁc crea-
tionism and the various legislative
attempts to get equal treatment for
creationism and evolutionary theory
in the Iowa public schools,” Chrisr
Liansen said.

“And we developed a quite elabor
rate study of creationism which we
presented to the govemor’s ofﬁce,
which was eventually made avail»
able to the state legislatttre and may
have had some impact on the defeat
of various attempts to get such a bill
tluough. With the state legislature,
it’s hard to determirte that.“

Whether the group will be as ac-
tive under Gov. Branstad as it was
under Gov. Ray “depends on if there
are any hot potatoes that get tossed
to us." he said. Some topics likely to
come up thistime,he said,arebioder
gradable plastics and recycling.

“Unfortunately, as I was purging
my ﬁles, to use the term, when I was
moving, when I had to get rid of
huge amountsof material,in order to
get into a somewhat slighter space, I
threw away all the huge piles I had
on the Governor's Science Advisory
Council, not realizing I was going to
be reappointed.” Christians/en said.
“I had a huge amount of material. as
you can imagine. "

Campus Fiber Optic
Network Is In Place

The system will
link Burling’s card
catalogs with the
computer and
increase speed

by 1,000 times.

By Diane Brumley

In late June of this past summer,
GrinncllCollegefundeda8130,000
cabling project to update and im
prove the campus-wide computer
system, The new system. the Fiber
Distributed Datalnterface network,
is not in full use yet, but will even-
tually allow for acomputer hook-up
with Burling Library’s card catar
logs, guard against a system shut-
down and increase the speed of com-
munication by 1.000 times,

The FDDI system, installed by
Digital Equipment Corporation, is
said to be one of the most advanced
and efficient computer networking
systems in the country. Although
the University of Iowa has been
voicing plans to install the fiber
optic network in their computer
system, Grinnell College remains
the ﬁrst and only institution in the
state with such an advanced inter-
lacing system of campus comput-

ers.

Thc FDDI system consists ofsev'
cral fiber opttc cables contained
within aplastic tubing about a half-
inch in diameter. This tubing gives
the FDDI system an advantage over
the former coaxial cable system in
several ways. First and foremost,
the FDDI system is less susceptible
to a SySlCmAwrde shut-down. Since
the old copper coaxial cables that
had been the basis of the computer
network were such good conduc-
tors ofelectricity, the entire system
could have been temporarily incaa
pacitated in the event that the obser~
vatory had been struck by lightning,

Residents of Gates

Tower Evacuated

By Kimberly Eckart

The six residents of Gates
Tower were evacuated Wednes-
day after the sagging roof re-
vealed leaks irt the plaster. The
students were temporarily relo-
cated to lounges while the physi-
cal plant began the process of
reconstruction.

According to physical plant
director Dan Tindall, the bal-
listed roof. an insulated energy
efficient structure installed in
1982, had been damaged by
excessive water build-up. Water
had escaped into the roof drain,
eventually causing the leaks
which initially alerted the resi-
dents. The physical plant began
tearing down the roof this week
and will soon start reconstruct-
inganew roof secured with steel.

“We‘re going to rebuild the
roof from inside,” Tindall said.

“We hope to finish within a
month."

Untilthestudentsareallowed
toretum to the tower, theyhave
been assigned to singles. Ac-
cording to Associate Dean of
Housing Jennifer Krohn, the
two dorm lounges used as im-
mediate temporary housing had
been traditionally used forsuch
purposes and enabled the two
groups involved in the group
draw to stay together.

“We think we're doing
what’s best for the students."
said Krohn.

The students — three sopho-
mores, twojuniors and a senior
— are adjusting to the situ-
ation. “It’s too bad this hap-
pened, but I think the situation
was handled well. I'm happy
wherel am, butI’m prepared to
go back to the tower," said
Kathleen Standard.
