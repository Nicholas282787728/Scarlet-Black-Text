While Grinnellians were on break. Jews
around the world were celebrating Succot.
Succot literally means “tabernacles,”
“booths" or “temporary huts” and rclers
to the temporary dwellings or the children
or Israel during the iorty years oi wanders
ing iollowmg their exodus irom Egypt.
During the Succot one is to “dwell In
booths" to commemorate this period In
Israel's history.

One builds booths or ”sukkahs" which
must have at least three walls but a Iourth
side which may be and often ls left open,
[It's usually made by connecting long
pieces or wood] Famllies say blessings
and eat bread and anything additional that
they choose, not necessarily but tradi-
tionally eating a meal. each day of Succot
Blessings are said over “four species." —
a Citron (called “etrog” in Hebrewt. a
palm branch llulavt. a myrtle branch
(hadas). and a wlllnw branch iaraval and
with them "rejoice before the Lord," This
is done by waving the species in all direc7
tions to “indicate the presence olr‘God
everywhere."

Not only does Succot commemorate the
historical period of the exodus. but it is
also a celebration of iaith in God. that God
will somehow lullill one's needs. and that
one must be grateful to God. The sukkah
symbolizes God's protection and the open,
“insecure" ceiling symbolizes one's Iaith
in God,

The holiday always comes rive days

people pray to God and ask that he iulIill

Way Out in London

What do students actually do in class?

By Shelley Reid

You are perhaps wondering how I have
managed to write five articles and hardly
mention the Grinnellrianondon program
itsell. I have avoided the subject partly
because I have no wish to sound even
remotely like the infamous GIL Hand!
book. But mostly, it's just an oversight;
one rarely pays much attention to the ac7
tual Way Out tunless one is in a tube star
tion. when a small mlstake could get you
even more lost than normal), and one cer-
tainly does not write home about it.

However, the GIL program is rather an
exceptional way out, so I suppose it
deserves some mention The entire pro-
gram runs out of two rooms adjacent to St.
Matthews. at 7Victorian NeoGothics
Anglican Church: (seriously, That's what
they’told us it was at orientation) in
Layswater. somewhat west oi central Lon»
don

The smaller of the two rooms is our
classroom, a room which has NEVER suir
lered. as do many rooms in ARI-l. from an
excess amount of heat. It has chairs but no
desks. It you have never learned how to
cross your legs, balance a notebook on one
knee, shiver, and take legible notes. all at
the same time. every class here can be an
adventure,

the larger, warmer room serves us as a
combination of Hurling, Mears, the
Forum. and Quad. Reference books and
reserve reading {or some classes can be
[ound there. if one so desires. Admissions
(theatre tickets) and Financial Aid (mon-
thly travel subsidies) are located in a back

corner on a less official note, the room ,

also contains a table at one end with
several of those wonderlul London
newspapers, another table with iixings ior
