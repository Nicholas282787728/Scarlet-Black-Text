The fifth point concerns job security.
McConnell mentioned that the nhvsical
plant now employs 73 workers, whereas
before, this department employed 92
workers. Accordlng to Union ofﬁcials.
the reduction in the number of
employees at the physical plant has
been due to attrition, The department
reached its highest level oi employment
when many buildings on campus were
being renovated.

McConnell then stated, “We have
dismissed only iive employees out oi
more than 130 in the past nine years."
At least iour oi these ‘tive employees
have been dismissed in the past tour
years. Food Service currently

McConnell added that "[all
employees were dismissed] with cause.
Poor periormance is not protected by a
union Contract," At this time. one case

had about 94 workers in 1970. but since
then. we have not replaced some or the
workers who have retired because our
need ior workers has dropped."

About so oi the on B & G workers are
members oi Local so.

Many Food Service workers have ex—
pressed their desire to continue work
ing with College students.

one Food Service worker said “Our
jobs are more interesting ii we have the
students around, The issue here is Job
security, not the presence at student
workers."

oi dismissal is being heard by President
Drake» as the worker has chosen to ap-
peal McConnell's decision, The case
has also been taken to the lowa civil
Rights Commission.

The last point reiers to a portion oi-

the unsigned letter which States, “It it
is beneﬁcial (or our managers to have a
long term written contract for job
security. why is it unreasonable {or the
rest oi the employees to ensure

too is a distortion. All administrative
agreements say there is. ”no guarantee
oi employment ior any speciiic period
oi time: subject to provisions oi the
stall handbook. All of us‘work at the
pleasure of the President.”

Both President Drake and College
Treasurer Bob Anderson said mat col
lege managers are given letters at ap-

pointment. These letters are signed by
the manager, and are binding ior one
year.

Finally. McConnell attached two
charts comparing wages and benefits
at Grinnell to other institutions. The
tirst chart. "A Wage Comparison study
oi FoursYear Private Colleges and Two
Local institutions Providing Food Ser-
vice.” lists the wage averages oi eight
un-‘named institutions.

The second chart "A Beneﬁts Com-
parison Study," compares beneiits
such as retirement. sick leave, etc at
urinnell to eight unnamed institutions.

Both oi these charts indicate that
Grinnell Food Service workers have
better wages and benefits that the uric
named institutions, There is no indica-
tion as to whether the institutions
selected ior either chart constituted
random samples.
