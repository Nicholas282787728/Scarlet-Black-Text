Harkin addresses

tangential issues

by Katrina \\'t)itil

Tom Harkin. Democratic cane
dictate in the 1934 Iowa senatorial
race. spoke at Grinnell last Thurs-
day in South Lounge, Harkin,
presently a , House ltepreseir
tative from the 3th district. is run~
ning against incumbent
Republican Roger Jepsen.

The race between Jepsen and
llarkin. Called one of the nation's
closest by llarkln's campaign. is
becoming increasingly intense.
Jepsen. tor the iirst time. is
leading llarkin in the polls.

Both men have had long careers
in Iowa politics. Harkin elected
House Representative in 1974. and
Jepsen, Senator in 1973. Both are
activist lawmakers, at odds With
each other Over issues such as the
deiicit. detense policy. Iowa's
iarm programs, school prayer.
and abortion.

“who scan-bettererepresente
Iowans” has become a major
campaign theme tor the can-
didates' campaigns. Not surprise
ing. their differences in personal
style and political philosophies
have intensdied the issue—oriented
debates.

Last Thursday Harkin address
ed the major issues of the cam-
paign including the nuclear
ireeze, environmental policy.
deticits, the detense budget. and
Iowa's agricultural policies.

The main thrust of his speech.
however. was the importance of a
strong iederal role in public
education. Harkin claimed that
due to the rapid development at
technology. things such as Lasers
“are no longer a Buck Rogers fan»
tasy." and we are ireer irom
manual labor than ever before,
More leisure time will enable us to
think creatively. he asserts. and
will encourage the growth oi the
arts and the humanities. Harkin
stated that we should not Overlook
the significance oi technology in
our lives.

To meet the challenges 0|
education in the future. Harkin

proposed three steps: ll to attract
the best and the brightest students
into te' hing; 2) to give students
access to the tools they need
whether they are books, com-
puters. or chemicals. and at to
make higher education more ac~
cessible to all Americans Harkin
said that he will do all he can to "1'
sure that students who need
federally funded linancral aid
receive it. while accusing .lepsen
ct halting every major step
towards better education.

0n school prayer. he claimed
that the government should not be
able to write school prayers and

.Joked that kids pray enough in

school when hoping to pass their
chemistry exams.

Harkin cited the need to lower
the deficits as one oi his primary
issues. For example. he mention
ed that by 1989 we will be paying
$900.00 in interest payments just
on the national debt.

on defense issues. Harkin
challenged the cost effectiveness
oi the current deiense program
and stressed the need to reexe
amine the defense budget. Bolts
priced at $25.00 on the market are
inilated to is times that price and
sold to he government. Harkin
states, '8 need Senators who
know how to say ‘no' to the Pen
tagon." _

A strong advocate oi en-
vironmental issues. Harkin said
we should clean up the 3 known
toxic waste sites in Iowa as Well as
others around the country. He also
advocates the modification of ”18
Clean Water Act to better protect
lakes and streams from toxic
Chemicals. He would have to
government develop a program to
control acid rain. and restore the

research,

Harkin then cited the arms race

"The nature oi reality involves
more than the material world and
through scien e alone no cannot
understand it

’I‘h - theory 0] Beryl Clottelter.
Williston Professor 01 Physics.
ushered in a series of nvoca-
ticns by protessors oi Griniiell.
His top . “A Scientist in the
chapel". dealt with the question
of what science can and cannot do
w ith regard to religion. Clotlelter
treated religion in the
philosophical sense rather than
addressing any speciiic religion,

"Science can provc religion to
be right and science can discredit
religion." stated clotlelter,

Clolielter‘s argument centers
on the Concept ot science and
religion complimenting our
under-standing oi reality. He
stressed that science and religion

are not in competition 7 and yes
science does have a place'in the
chapel.

Along the same line. Clotfeltel‘
maintained that science deals
with the material world. but can
say nothing about the iminateriai
uorld. Science is limited and its
methods are appropriale only tor
the material world. That is why
religion is necessary for a full
understanding or reality

”Reality comprises more than
the material world Scientiiic suce
ccss cannot conclude Vihether the
material world IS all that exists."
asserted CiOlfeltel' and then add-
ed. “Nobody really knows all the
parts oi the argument, We linde ..
iand less than people assume,"

To support this theory.
clotlelter sighted thc physicists
theory about atoms as related to

matter. Pointing lo this theory as
a "naive notion". he expressed
that the theory of matter is much
more complicated than people
realize

Further elaborating his point.
Clotfelter said the general tendene
cy in society is to believe that
science can do everything and
many believe that it a question
cannot be answered by science, it
is not ivorth answering. Clotlelier
claims this idea ls untrue,

“I'd like Students to realize and
think about the fact that many im-
portant questions can't be treated
by science alone and when mak-
ing a decision you should look at
more than what science can give
you." clottelter remarked
