I’m so depressed Sunday i thought
I’d glance through the classified ads
and pretend I had graduated and now
had to [ind meaningful employment. I
started out confidently in the A sec-
tion, sure that the perfect job oppor-
tunity lie in wait in the next column.
Got to the B’s and things went from
bad to worse. Finally, there in the
W's, 1 round the only Job ror which I
met the qualifications. I could be a
Salad Maker at the Wakonda Club,
(Obviously I would't make it as a tile
clerk.)

My mother called that evening, I
gave her the depressing news. All she
had to say was, “What makes you
think you're oualiiied for that?"

I hung up in total despair, She was
right. The only salad i knew how to
make was the one with the leafy green
stuff mixed with a carrot that‘d been
shredded to hell, Simple and basic,
less is more, etc.

Oh, I cried for a minute or two but
then decided to take iirm, decisive at}
tion in qualitying mysell tor a job. 1
Set aside Cultural Materialism and
Masters ot Modern Drama and pulled
out the three most valuable texts oi
my college career. Namely, The Sur-
vival Cookbook. The Great Cook‘s
Guide to Salad and The Joys of Jellor

Well, scratch the first one, all they
suggested was the leafy stun,

Anyway, the other two were or
tremendous help I‘ve learned so
much already. For instance, did you
know gazpacho, that “summer blend
oi tomatoes, cucumbers and bell pep~
pers," is really salad in the form of
soup? Or that the Egyptians oliered
lettuce to the iertility god because oi
its aphrodisiac qualities, or that salad
“satisfies that craving for something
tart in the middle of the meal." or
that (and this is one at my favorites)
there is a way to make jello so that
you can pack it in your backpack, take
it to the library, and eat it six hours
later with your fingers, without leav-
ing cherry red marks on the pages of
Cicero? No kidding. And it I get
enough mail 1 ll publish the recipe

Any good tradesman naturally needs
a tool kit. In the salad business that
includes a spin/dryer (I hear Maytag
has one on the market), a glass bowl,
and wooden salad hands.

Yes, [said glass bowl, Sure, a
wooden bowl looks great on the table
and so forth but the oil from the salad
clings to the bowl and turns rancid,
Rubbing the bowl with garlic may
make it turn rancid as well. The
thought of this is enough to make me

Wooden salad hands are exactly
what they sound like. Digited little .
hand shapes that dig to the bottom of.
the bowl. bringing up just the perfect;
amount of dressing while folding the .
delicate greens neatly and gently. ‘
Best oi all after supper you can use
them for a massage.

And the things you can do with
Jello,..my goodness gracious. Sociable
side Salads, salads {or the slim life, ‘» ,
salads as super desserts, and jello 7 ,
salads “You Never Thought Of.” I V i
haven't read that chapter yet but it it
offers the same bouncy, cool fun as
the others it sounds provocative and
titillating.

Ive learned a lot about the salad
trade in a few short days and I still
have three and a half months until, j
graduation There is hone.

Many of my critics have accused me
oi writing trite little columns. 1 Sup
pose these same stone throwers will
also tossrmy salad reﬂections on the
ruiiage heap, But I’ll warn you. you'
ain't read nothing yet...

Frankly, I can t help being trite i'in
confused. Mixed up. i don t know
whether to seriously pursue my salad
making interests or apply to graduate
school in Anthropology while secretly
hoping to be discovered for Broadway

I guess I'm just trying to prove to.
somebody that I’m qualitied ior
something aiter tour years or college.
And lately, being in my “salad days,"
I’ve been considering that
metaphorically speaking real his
more closely resembles a salad than
anything acquired at a liberal arts col-
lege. (That is, unless you are pre-med
or a Russian major ) For example:
life is like a salad. you‘ve got to make
it before you can eat it; you’ve got to
use your little salad hands and dig for
the dressin' sometimes it takes a
while to gel; and so forth...
