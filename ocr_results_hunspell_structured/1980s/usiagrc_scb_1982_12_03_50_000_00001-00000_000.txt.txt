college approves
Cooper's destruction

by Ellen Heath
and Kim MacDonald

when students return to campus next
January the 01d Cooper School on East
Street will no longer be standing. The (201*
lege has owned the building since 1977 and
‘has used it to store furniture during dorm
renovations, but new plans to raze it
sometime around the first of the year. The
building is reportedly currently in such
bad condition that it cannot be used for any

purpose and the cost to repair it is pro-

hibitive.

The school was closed in 1913 as a result
of parents’ complaints that it was unsafe.
Harry Ritter, a local businessman, bought
the building at a public auction for $43,000,
according to the Grinnell Herald Register.
He planned to tear down the school and
build condominiums.

However, Ritter encountered zoning and
legal complications. Harry Louden, who
was Ritter's lawyer at the time, explained
that Ritter ”contacted an architectural
firm in Iowa City about the possibility of
condominiums. No drawings were made,
but preliminary attempts to change.the
zoning were made."

Ritter and Louden began to acquire the
written consent from neighbors of the Site
needed to change the ordinances, but, “It
was never pursued to the end," said
Louden. He added that he thought it was
not in Ritter's best interests to Continue the
project due to his “age and health," The
high cost was also a factor in the deciSion.

Levy and Malone and Company. 3 Des
Moines firm which built government
assisted rental housing, then considered
buying the property. However, because of
title complications, that company never
became the official owner of the site. They
did have drawings made up but. according
to Louden, “couldn‘t persuade the town”
to agree to zoning changes. Levy and
Malone then began negotiations with the

college, and on october 3, 1977, Ritter gave ‘

the deed to the company which gave it to
die college on the same day. The college
refused to disclose the purchase price, but
Louden claims that both Ritter and Levy
and Malone made profits from the sale,
The administration did not at the time,
however, know how the building or proper-

ty would be used. The Scarlet and Black on
October 14, 1977 said, “Grinnell ad-
ministrators have not yet announced
speleic plans for utilization of the proper-
ty. Dean Walker did say, however, that
demolition of the old school was a definite
probability. According to Walker the
school is a nuisance as it stands. " In an n
terview on November 8,1982,Presid nt‘
George Drake said the property was pur-
chased to prevent low income housing
from being built there.

During the time between when the
school was closed and when the college
bought it the building was empty and
unheated. According to Dale Hawn, direc-
tor of building and grounds, “There was
considerable damage done to the walls'
because freezing and thawing caused
cracks' ln the masonry.

The administration asked Hawn whether
the building could be used as anything
other than a storage facility. and he said it
could not. He explained that Cooper School
is a wood-framed structure, and that
because of current fire codes it cannot be
used for many purposes as an educational
building. Drake said woadrframed struc-
tures may not be used as dormitories but
may house office space,

' The cost of replacing the wooden frame,
according to Hawn would be very high and
to entirely replace the building would
“probably (be) much more economical
than to restore the building." Drake ex-
plained that the college has kept the school
up as long as it has only for storage space.

Other uses for the school have been con—
sidered, including an art gallery and addi-
tional office space, but Drake said it would
be less expensive to build a new structure.
He added that “There is a limit to how
much the trustees are willing to spend to
preserve old buildings." At a faculty
meeting on Nov, 1, the President said, “I
can't in good conscience argue with the
board that we ought to save everything
that's up.” He said if Mears is to be saved
“one has to be willing to make a few
sacrifices." Mears Hall is also a wood
framed building, and the administration is
considering renovating it for the Admis»
sions Office use. although that plan is not
definite.

The specter of demolition is not new to
the Cooper School. Since its construction in
1899, the school‘s existence has been
fraught with problems and threats of
closure.

The school was named in honor of Col-
onel Samuel F. Cooper. In addition to serv-
ing as Grinnell's first mayor and the editor
and publisher of the Grinnell Herald,
Cooper was also appointed us. Counsel to
Glasgow, Scotland.

Faced with a major classroom shortage .

in 1899, the school board constructed the
building in a rush. Only three years after
the opening of Parker School. which was
situated at the current location of Fareway
grocery store, the board realized the
urgent need for another school. Their
haste was apparent, for only one year after
Cooper opened, an architect found the
structure “shoddlly done." He noted “1m,
perfections in plastering, uneven floors
and doors and no pointing even on the
(Window) sills."

Major innovations in education after the
building was constructed made it made
quate for 20th century needs. Without a
gymnasium, adequate storage space, of-
fices and a library, the school was definite»
ly at a loss. The sole recreation room was
once used as a Coal bin, One former stu»
dent explained that in the late 1940:, when
ever the school had any programs, each
student had to carry down their own chair
from the classroom,

Although the school was built on what
was then the outskirts of town, and
Highway Six was much narrower, the tralr
be passing by the school became a prom
blem after WWII The growth of Grinnell
and the modern llal'l'lc provided students
with little playground space However
there was a baseball diamond In the
southwest corner of the lawn and slides,
swings, at merry-gO-round and seesaws in
the back of the building.

Sanitation was also somewhat of a pro
blem. One mother claimed that in the sprr
mg her child had to wear rubber boots
because of the thick mud in front of the
school. The entire building had ventilation
problems. especially the restrooms. One
mother lamented that her children came

, homeeach day with a ‘:stenchj1 on their

‘Anﬁquqfed school

but adored

clothing from the restrooms. She further
complained that the stalls had no parti-
tions. The stench of the bathrooms also af-
fected the lunchrooms.

Parents of children who attended the
school in the 19705 complained frequently
that their children were not receiving a
comparable education to students at the
other grammar schools. Parents voiced
their opinions at school board meetings
and in letters to the Herald Register, Their
main complaint was the safety of the
building.

The energy crisis was also a factor in the
school closing. While heating systems in
all the other buildings in the district could
be converted to cheap, available fuel,
Cooper could not. A former student recall»
ed that it was very chilly during the cold
spells when it was run on coal in the '40s
She remembered one day in kindergarten
when the teacher allowed the children to
wear their coats and “tramp quietly”
around the room to keep warm.

in the 19705 opposition to the school grew
to such heights that an investigating com-
mittee was formed After examining the
school, even the chairman of the “Save
Cooper School" committee voted to sup»
port closure. Gayle C. Obrecl‘it, chief of
plant facilities of the Grinnell-Newburg
school district, reported to the superinten-
dent in 1574, “The building is in a poor
state of repair " He stated that windows
need repair, “paint. won't stay on the .
walls, plaster is peeling off. and the
building needs rewiring " Because of the
extensive use of wood in the construction
with wooden stairs, floors. classrooms and
corridors, Obrecht appeared to agree
with the overwhelming sentiment that the
building was a fire hazard. A final seal of
Cooper 3 death warrant was obrecht s
recommendation that “It was too costly
and not practical to rehabilitate the
school," '

Alumni remember the school fondly
though, A student who attended in the
19405 noted the ‘relalively progressive
teaching methods used. In second grade
she recalls studying American Indians and
the life size teerpee they constructed in the
back of their classroom. A current college
student remembers the large classrooms
and wood floors, He explained, “I love that
School."
