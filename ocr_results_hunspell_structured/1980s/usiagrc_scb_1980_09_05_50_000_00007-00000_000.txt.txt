unknown number at Grinnell ad-
ministrators, staff, and taculty
members and students for many years

dent Advisers, who have since
departed. Royce, who received her
Master's degree iii Library Science
from the University of Illinms at Ur-
band and her Bachelor’s degree at
Maharishi International University,

has been trained as a TM teacher. This
experience allows her to introduce peo-
ple to the technique, teach its practice,
and conduct lollowup workshops.

Royce will deliver the next introduc-
tory lectureat a p.m., September 10 in
the Viewing Room at Burling, Arter the
