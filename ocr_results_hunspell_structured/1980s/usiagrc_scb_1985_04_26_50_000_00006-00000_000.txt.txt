As is becoming commonplace, Ian
Mclean has once again given the liberal
community something to think about.
In the last issue oi the Outcry. he (I am
assuming he is responsible lor this
editoriall likened the shooting of the
American Army sergeant in East Ger
many with the Korean Airliner incir
dent, In his column several weeks ago
in the 5&8 lApril 5). he complained
that the liberal community was incon-
sistent in its concern for human rights
violations. and the “grim
anniversariy] of KAL 007 . , [went]
without the vigils. protests, and peti-
tions which [lt] deserves." Although
lnuch of the logic in Ian's article is
similar to that used by the conservative
who. complaining about the recent pro-
lest. commented that none of theliberal
community was chanting “KGB out of
Afghanistan." Kerry Koon has already
eloquently responded to this latter come
plaint. but I think two things do need to
be mentioned here. First. nobody saw
the conservatives rushing to organize
the “deserved" Vlgils of this and other
events Ian mentioned. and second that

1 think he is. however, right in poin»
ting out that the KAL 007 incident and
the shooting in East Germany are
analogous. Something that the editor of
a more liberal'newspaper than the Out-
cry pointed out which is also analogous
here has to do with a recent Supreme
Court decision: “It is more than irony
that. on the day the us. government
expressed outrage that the Soviets shot

As a ardent feminist I flnd most of his
argument pallatlble. However, I don‘t
know that I can accept his suggestion
that the right to control my body is in-
sufﬁcient political argument but then

don't think anyone should be shot for
trespassing. I also oppose the death
penalty. but that's a different story.
However. reading all this stufi in The
Register. etc. about the incident in East
Germany, I was reminded of another
incident. also analogous to the other
two. but which was surrounded by no
amount whatsoever of diplomatic

upheaval or newspaEr editorials.

The Kremlin is huge. It is contained
within walls that used to be the boun-
daries oI the City. Inside these Walls are
cathedrals. one of the most important
theaters in the Soviet Union. a nice little
garden. a huge statue of a pensive and
self-assured VI. Lenin. and. among
other things. the governing body of a
country analagous to our own in its
status as a ”world power.“ Obviously.
there are also streets. and one of them
is so wide it is almost square (as I
remember there are not even lane divi~
sions) It narrows 0H. and as it does so
there is a wide crosswalk. Now. on my
first visit of the Kremlin, my friend and
I. heavily armed with' our Moscow
guidebook. after having had our fill of
fourteenth century cathedrals, decided
it was time to pay our visit to Vladimir
Ilich. It happened that from where we
were standing. the statue was right
across from us, and "across" happened
to be that huge street. Being Sunday,
there were no important Politburo
members cruising by in limousines; as
a matter of fact. there was no cars on
the road. and hadn't been for some
time, Knowing that the shortest
distance between two points is in a
straight line. we embarked on our
journey. Unfortunately. we hadn‘t

Grounds (B and G). Considering the
take home pay for secretaries on this
campus, they might as well be inden-
tured slaves. At any rate. I was trying
to get a handle on what comparable
worth means in these particular situa»
tlons. The way I understand it. the idea
at comparable worth was an attempt to
ameliorate the descrepancy in pay due
to job segregation. For example,
women are more likely to be
secretaries than to be carpenters. II the
two jobs are comparable then women
should receive comparable wages.
Strauber explained that at least three
considerations need to be made when
trying to determine whether two
separate sets of skills are comparable
Fir t how much skill docs the job r

involved on the job? And third. what

made two steps before a policeman ap
peared out of a crowd of tourists and
started feverishly blowing his whistle. .
Startled. we looked up. tried to hgure
out what the problem was, and con»
tinued walking This infuriated him
more so in between his blowing on his
whistle he began screaming at us and
pointing luriously at the crosswalk. We .
got the idea. and. not wanting to create
a scandal. turned around. went back to r
the sidewalk, up to the crosswalk, and
crossed like good comrads. However.‘
we probably offended him. as we could
not help giggling the whole time.

Although this was my first ex- ,
pcricnce with the nature of Soviet
crosswalks. my semester was sprinkled .
with many Such incidents. I really hate
to make broad generalimtions Irurn 1
anecdotes. but as in the whole twenty
years I've been in the United States I've
never once gotten reprimanded for
jaywalktng on a deserted street. I think
in this case it does make some com» .
ment on the Soviet mentality. They
have very little lreedom to affect large ».
things, so the ten or twenty square feel
they are given to guard they take very
seriously — be it a crosswalk. a bit of
airspace or an East German military
base. 1' D

As I said I don't think killing is
“right " and I am therefore not trying 4
to “explain away" (to quote Ian) the
Soviets in either of these incidents. Nor ’
do i think spying is “right." no matter
who i is done by. As Ian said. “a crime
is a crime.” However. I do think that,
because of my experience with Soviet
crosswalks. 1 maybe understand the .
Soviet point oi view of what happened in
a different way than most Americans, t
and this had led me to think that
perhaps we it make more progress in
preventing such incidents through
diplomacy if we spend as much time
asking why something happened as we .
do asking whether it should have hap-
pened.

pointed out to me that the aforemen-

comparing skills and ”neither are they

to unionize or not. Clearly. B and G and

secretaries and the women running the
library. Regardless of whether this is a
