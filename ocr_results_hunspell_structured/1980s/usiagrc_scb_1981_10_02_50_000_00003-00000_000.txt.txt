Energy, its cost, availability and conser-
vation, became a pressing concern for the
tirst time almost a decade ago when the
Arab oil states first formed OPEC. Since
that time Americans have learned to live
with 135 v less heat in the winter and less
air conditioning in the summer. But what
about here at Grinnell College?

The college became interested in conserr
ving energy, ”not because or economic
reasons, but because of necessity," said
Director of the Physical Plant Dale Hawn.
This necessity arose during the 1973-74
academic year when Grinnell’s supplier,
Iowa Southern Utilities Co., “ran out."

Most of Gn'nnell's heat is generated by
burning natural gas to produce steam or
hot water. on an average late December or
early February day Physical Plant pmr
duces 25,000 to 28,000 pounds or steam per
hour. But, because the availability of gas is

proprietized with city residential areas at

the top, sometimes Grinnell is forced to buy
oil, which also comes on a priority basis
However, bunting 0i] costs about twice as'
much as gas per 1,000 pounds of steam,

The college currently pays energy bills
totaling approximately $500,000, twothirds
of which goes toward heating with the other
third paying for electricity. Of the energy
generated at the Physical Palnt, 30 percent
goes to uses other than heat including
domestic hot water and Food Service
operations,

Although the college managed to get
through the 1973-74 Winter Without eXr
hausting its reserve supply completely, ef-
forts began immediately to reduce the
likelihood of a similar crisis.

The first measure taken did not help
'reduceenergyuse but did help Grinnell
become a little more energy sell-sullicient.

During the summer of 1974 the college in
creased their oil storagetspace from 40,000
to 120,000 gallons of oil by adding {our tanks
to the existing two between Loose Hall and
the railroad tracks. This oil, purchased
from Standard Oil, comes from the Clive
terminal in Des Moines, Hawn estimated
there is a two-month- i-eoerve at capacity
and said all tanks are presently full. Other
measures taken during l9’14 and the beginrr
ing of 1975 included ranking air condition
ing systems by individual buildings, in»
sulating heating pipes and initiating a cycl-
ing system in academic buildings. The
cycling system entails shutting off the heat
to those buildings widl air handling units
alter hours, which allows the buildings to
“live on inertia through the night,” accorr
ding to Hawn. All academic buildings ex-
cept Goodnow and ARH have air handling
systems.

The next group of energy improvements
came with the beginning of die dorm
renovations during 1977778, In addition to
such common conservation measures as
improving insulation and using double-
hung storm windows, the college changed
the type of heating used in the dorms and
redesigned the ventilating systems.

Instead or using steam, the residence
halls now use hot water. The new system
allows Physical Plant to vary the
temperature ol the water as the outside
temperature varies. Outside sensory
devises also installed during renovations
aid this process. The new ventilating
systems primarily affect heat loss through
the bathroom windows
dcrrns students must open windows when
bathrooms become too humid. But in the
completed dorm bathrooms, fans draw air

Energy policy designed by campus committee

Hawn says consumption curve leveling

through natural openings, such as doors,
thus continually cycling fresh air.

When Clark Hall reopened in the fall of
1978, Hawn made some crude comparisons
between it and Langan Hall. He found a 20
percent heating reduction but speculated
that actual savings could have been greater
because “the bathrooms in Clark were
nicer” so students possibly stayed in the
bathrooms longer, thereby, using more
heat in the form of water,

For Norris Hall, Hawn found even more
dramatic results. Even with the fourth
floor, which was added in 197980, he
estimated a so percent reduction in energy
use. Hawn credits the Energy Policy Ad-
visory Committee with suggesting ideas in
addition to the measures taken by the col-
lege. The Energy Committee was the brain
child of former Vice-Provost of the college
Ken Brewing and includes students, faculty
and administrators Executive Vice-
President Waldo Walker heads the present
committee.

“We reset space thermometers, after the
oil embargo, to SE degrees in the winter and
78 degrees in the summer," said Hawn.
“But nobody supported it until the energy
committee "

In addition to temperature controls, imr
provements include placing restrictors in
shower heads, disconnecting some or-
namental lighting, lowering the water
temperature from 140 degrees to about 110
degrees and reducing the heat of the swims
ming pool from as degrees to 82 degrees.

Although direct savings of these
measures are dilticult to monitor,
available literature estimates an eight
gallon per minute water reduction with the
shower restrictors and a three percent
change in consumption for every one

degree reduction in heat lrom turning down
thermostats. But when asked to translate
all of the improvements so far into percenr
tage savings, Hawn admitted the college
and Iowa Southern Utilities lack the
devices. In order to assess actual savings,
variables such as humidity, wind speed and
direction, temperature, and length of day
must be mken into consideration. Accor-
ding to Hawn, a change in any one of these
variables could drastically change the
amount ol energy needed.

However, Hawn was able to cite several
indicators to total improvement. ﬁrst, the
college has avoided paying a penalty on
electricity lor three years. Also. the
amount of heating luels used has gone down
steadily as renovations progress. In addi»
tion, Hawn noted over the last two years the
college's gas supply was interrupted tor on
ly 12 hours, the lowest since the lorming ol
OPEC, However, this could be due to the
mildnms of the last two winters,

Hawn estimated the overall energy
reduction at 40 percent from ten years ago.
Translated into cost per student, he tallied
the cost avoided at approximately $145 in
increased fees, even though energy costs
have risen steadily through the period.

Looking to the future, Hawn said. "I
think we've done all that we can without
students being aware of it ."‘From here, he
sees such steps as concentrating study
areas to specilic buildings or parts ol
buildings and holding seminars to aquaint
new students with Iowa weather before
winter hits as possible areas tor considera-
tion. “We're Seeing some leveling off Wain“
consumption curve." he said, “I think the
college community has responded positive

Herald-Register channel provides 24-hour news
Bi-weekly paper now supplemented by continuous information

by Laura McDermith

Channel 12 on Grinnell’s cable television
is a 24-hour news station provided by The
Grinnell Herald—Register. Because the
Herald-Register is published only on
Mondays and Thursdays, the news station
offers a solution to the gap created by the
biweekly paper.

The station is a community service but is
not intended as a bulletin board for
community events. The paper covers local
groups and organizations while the news
station is intended to provide up to date
information on important stories belore
the paper comes out with greater detail.
Al Finder, publisher of the Grinnell and
Poweshiek County newspaper, said he
plans to sell advertising space The news
station is “not now an income source,"
said Finder, but he “hopes to make it one.”

The news station has a page format.
Currently the newspaper utilizes about 15»
25 pagﬁ of its 100 page capacity with eight
lines per screenpage. The pages stay on
the screen for 15 seconds each and con-

tinue in rotation 24 hours a day. News
headlines are entered by way of a com
puter terminal in the Herald-Register
office. There are eight colors that can be
used tor backgrounds, borders and letters.

The sound [or the station is the weather
forecast, which is also repeated 24 hours a
day. One of the pages is a weather radar
screen the center of which is Des Moines.
The screen shows approaching storms.

The news station is not widely used, yet,
according to Pinder. He estimated that
about 1,000 people Currently subscribe to
the cable service. Use is increasing
steadily, according to Finder, The news
station is in a “starting mode” Finder
said. People need to be made aware ol the
usefulness and convenience of the service.

The news station was first introduced in
Ottumwa, Iowa. It has been successful
there, so when the cable company offered
the news station option to the Herald-
Register, it accepted. Finder is ”happy
with the option.” he said.

Scholars’ Convocation

by Tom Matthews

Thursday, Oct. 8 at 11 a.m. in Herrick
Chapel dentist, doctor and nutritionist
Emanuel Cheraskin will address the
Grinnell community at a scholars’ cons
vocation entitled: “Another (somewhat
different) Philosophy of Health and
Sickness.”

Cheraskin, who helped write two books
on diet and health, comes to Grinnell
qualified in the field of health. After unr
dergraduate work at St. Joseph's College,
Georgetown University and University of
Alabama, .Cheraskin went onto receive a

masters degree from University of
Alabama. In 1943, Cheraskin received his
MD, from the University of Cincinnati
College oi Medicine.

As a professor emeritus at the Univer
sity of Alabama in Birmingham Cheraskin
holds many awards. Among these are:

'Research Award Competition of Chicago

Dental Society; Honors Achievement
Award, Aniology Research Foundation;
Lifetime Member, Royal Society of
Health, London; American Men and
Women of Science

Truman deadline

by Eric Weiss

As the Oct. 7 deadline lor applications
for the Truman Scholarships draws
nearer, the number of people interested is
relatively few. This seems surprising,
according to Walt Stone, the Truman
faculty sponsor, since a Grinnell student
has been awarded this scholarship every
year it has been in existence except one,

Any sophomore planning a career in
public service With at least a ”B” average
and is in the upper V4 ofhis class is eligible,
Any interested applicant must submit to
Stone the completed application, three

letters of recommendation and an essay of
600 words or less that discusses “some
public policy issue chosen by the student."
Alter all the applicants have turned in the
necessary materials, Grinnell nominates
two people for the national competition
(each accredited college can nominate up
to two students for the competition).
Following the final evaluation, up to 79
winners are named, A Truman Scholar-
ship awards SS.000 a year for two years 01
graduate study and two years of tin
dergraduate study.
