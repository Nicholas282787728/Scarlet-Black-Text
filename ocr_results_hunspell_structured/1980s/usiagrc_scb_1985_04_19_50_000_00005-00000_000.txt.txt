Students debate apartheid

by Jennifer Miller

The South African Consciousness
Week activities ended With _a debate
between Les Ragan speaking in favor of
immediate divestment of U.S. interests
in the Republic of South Africa and Ian
Mclean, speaking in favor of continued
U.S. investment and the use of that in-
vestment as a pressure weapon against
the apartheid regime.

Ragan, beginning the debate, sug-
gested that there are two options
available for ending apartheid — inter-
nal pressure or economicidisengage-
ment. The former he characterized as
reform while the latter he deﬁned as
revolution. Arguing agaisnt reform,
Ragan stated that since the policies of
constructive engagement began, the
South African government has not
changed its racist policies, while actual
reform has been slight. Ragan called
reform policies “over-simplistic" and
added that constructive means of
changing the economic system has led
to two problems, first, the South
African government has not changed
and they have stated that they would
not, and a second, deeper problem,
reform policies assume that a program
is acceptable. ”Apartheid is not o.k.”,
stated Ragan. The system cannot be
reformed, he emphasized. it must
be dismantled. Thus, Ragan continued
revolution is inevitable. Ragan
asserted that full and immediate

divestment would shorten this revolu—'

tion by weakening the South African
Government that the Revolutionaries
seek to topple. He made an analogy bet-
ween divestment and the situation of a
herion addict, stating that withdrawal
is at first difficult and painful but the
final result is a cleansed, pure body. In
concluding his opening statement sup«
porting immediate divestment from
South Africa, Les Ragan stated, “re
cent developments indicate that the fin»
evitable] revolution has already
begun."

Mclean began his statement asser-
ting his position that divestment is not
the means to the end of the apartheid
situation in South Africa He noted that
the United States’ investment is
significantly slighter than European
and Asian investment in South African
firms. Tiler-fore, he continued, divest-
ment would not significantly affect the
South African economy as a whole,
rather, he said, it would leave over
100,000 Black South Africans jobless.

The European and Asian powers would‘

purchase the stocks and captial that the
United States- relinquished, stated
Molean. Secondly McLean maintained,
in divesting completely from South
African firms and corporations, the
United States would lose any leverage it

currently holds with the South African
government, and thus make future
reforms impossible.

Refuting the View that revolution
would be the outcome of divestment.
Mclean focused on the necessity of fur-
ther reforms within the government to
end apartheid practices. Such reforms
would be for those found under the
Sullivan Accords, as well as social and
domestic reforms in the areas of hous-
ing, taxes and trade unions. He restated
his standpoint that divestment would
make the United States incapable of
pursuing such reforms.

Mclean concluded his remarks with
the statement that reforms are not the
only answer to the “complex and
discouraging problem” of apartheid.
He agreed that many corporations side

.step the issue, that the Sullivan Aer

cortds are not sufficient, and that clear-
ly the white minority does not favor
equality, Mclean supports a “peaceful
solution to apartheid", noting that it is a
severe problem “not to be eliminated
by an easy oneshot answer.

Each dehater limited'his rebuttal to
few brief statements. Ragan mentioned
that Americans cannot see the South
African Situation from the South
African perspective. He maintained
that the South Africans are disen-
chanted with the entire economic
system and they make little distinction
between American and South African
corporations. He contended that the
South Africans are dissatisfied with the
entire situation. Ragan's implication
was that they will turn to revolutionary
tactics.

Mclean, in his rebuttal, asserted that
the large number immigrants, legal
and illegal, as well as refugees, indicat-
ed that many people do not find the sit-
uation in South Africa unbearable. He
referred to Ragan’s earlier heroin ad-
dict analogy, agreeing with the percep—
tion and adding that he considered
apartheid to be a “a mental aberration
[whose] followers are crazed fanatics",
but he added, divestment amounts to
quitting “cold turkey” Mclean conclud-
ed. “1 would like to remind people the
result is [often] that they die.”

Following the rebuttals, Mclmn and
Ragan accepted questions from the
floor, the answers to which reasserted
each of their basic viewsr Ragan main»
tained that revolution is inevitable and
divestment would weaken the South
African government and thus shorten
the revolution, while Mclean contended
that divesting would cause the United
States to relinquish all influence in
South Africa, allowing apartheid prac-
tices to continue and perhaps worsen.

A positive
look on life

by Lorelei Kelly

when she was 13 years old, Marilyn
Ferguson made a promise to herself
that has greatly inﬂuenced her life ,' She
promised to “never pass up chances
because if you’re alive, you should
make it count for something.“

This philosophy has guided Ferguson
ever since and is embodied in her re-
cent book, The Aquarian Conspiracy.
Ferguson, who delivered Thursday's
convocation lecture on the “Visionary
Factor." advocates an aggressive ap-
proach to everyday living. She does not
want to grow old.

“Wheﬂler the risk taken is a success
or a flop, it is the people who continual-
ly take risks who eventually have the
most success," she said.

Her liberal perspective of life led her
to an interesting and innovative career.
While attending college in Colorado,
Ferguson dropped out and moved to
Los Angeles.

There she became involved in the
career which she continues to pursue
She now edits two newsletters.
“Leading Edge” and ”Brain/Mind,"
which report on new developments in
psychology.

Released in 1980, The Aquarian Con-
spiracy, has been highly successful
with 400,000 copies in print. The term
“Aquarian” is a positive word for a new
beginning. Ferguson said. It signifies a
new age and a new way of thinking.

In the book's title, the word con-
spiracy is not meant to be interpreted
with its usual shady connotations, she
said. It simply implies action towards a
result.

Before writing the book, Ferguson
traveled extensively and conducted in-
terviews with people who were working
on improving their lives and relation
ships.

Ferguson’s latest work 7 to be
released next year 7 is a book entitled
Visionary Factor: A ,guide to
Remembering the Future.

The book is about a new way of think~
ing and the methods a person uses to
learn it, she said, The book focuses on a
new approach to education through
which people learn to trust their own in-
tuition and to learn how to be comfor-
table with change.

“People must become their own
teachers. because life is an education,"
she said.

Through accepting change, people
can enjoy their lives more fully because
they will be able to drop something
when it no longer works. Ferguson said.

In her new book, Ferguson classifies
