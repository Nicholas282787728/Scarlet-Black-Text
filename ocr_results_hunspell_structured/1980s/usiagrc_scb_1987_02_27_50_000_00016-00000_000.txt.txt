The Kindred Community is a group oi
Volunteers who live in the shelters and
light to keep them alive. They believe. as
does the Community tor Creative Non-
Violence (CCNVJ. that all people.
regardless of race. sex and creed have a
right to these basic necessities Poverty is
not a judgment oi God. nor a result of
laziness, but is a result of the injustices
present in our current economic system.
Thus. the rights to basic necessities ought
not be usurped by those who exploit the
system tor their own beneiit.

Many members or the Community are

perienced the extent and magnitude oi the
problem at homelessness. It is their aim to
end the problem in Des Moines. and to hold
it up as an example to other cities When
poverty can exist in such close proximitv
to wealth and the richest nation in the
world can send many at its people to bed
tor to the streetl hungry. one wonders why
there hasn't been more positive action
taken by the leaders oi these institutions.
Their policies are antispoor and pro
wealth This cris is as important as has
ltonal defense and international relations.
but very little action has been taken that
shows a concern ior this problem.

wouldn't hurt to bring along Buddha as a
token oi good luck Buddha came along to
the meets. and. 1i) and behold. swimmers
came up with improved times The rest is
history. Since that dreadful year before
Buddha Came on the scene. the Pioneers

Says obermilier. "Our happy Buddha.
Hotai. is basically our team mascot. We
take him to all our meets. especially the
big ones. like conferences. He really
serves‘ an inspiration tor the guys while
they‘re swimming. He also pointed out
two other pieces or iniormation One is that
while many other schools take pokes at the
Buddha tor alleged religious signilicance.
there is actually no religious meaning [or
the Buddha to watch over the meets. “We
could just as easily have a Shirley Temple

doll as our mascot. but it \quU be sort oi
awkward chanting. ‘60 Shirley. Go
Shirley' during a S‘- 111 meet" ls how Obers
miller described it The other rtimor he

Buddha has \wrn out iii as been swiped

that no matter how hard anybody tries. he
is not going to be able to get rid of Buddha
that easily.

Hopefully this article has cleared the air
and shed some light on the legend of Bud

ing runny-looking iits. or drying bit
with iunny-looking towels or using a
