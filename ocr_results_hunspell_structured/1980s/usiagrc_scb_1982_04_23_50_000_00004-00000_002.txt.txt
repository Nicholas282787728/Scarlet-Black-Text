s_&B registers
disgust. outrage

We, the editors of the Scarlet and Black, would like to take this opportunity to
register our disgust and outrage at a recentjournallstlc trend, Specifically, we refer to
the so-called humor, the psuedotsarcasm we find exhibited in some of our publishing
compatriots. Headlines like ”’Mlld’ fertility drug produces triplets in 3 minutes” (The
Santa Fe New Mexican, 6/14/81), “Fried chicken cooked in microwave wins trip” (The
Portland Oregonian, 7/8/81), “Reagan Wins on budget but more lies ahead” (The
Blackfoot, Id. Morning News, 5/22/81) and "Stupid Burnup" [The Crinnell College 5&5

4/22/82) reflect this trend admirably. Perhaps the editors of other papers find these ‘

examples humorous. We, for one, do not.

We here at the 8&8 take our Journalism seriously. We believe that there are more
than enough serious, worthwhile issues facing our readers to provide stimulating arti-
cle topics. It is difficult to maintain the high level of respect we currently enjoy if we
are associated With the flippant tabloids currently dragging the good yournallstlc
name through the mud. lt is particularly deplorable when these cheap tactics are
employed With regard to serious ”hard news” events; or, worse yet when newspaper
staffers capitalize on ”soft news“ opportunities to promote their own adolescent ex

cess.

We feel this tradition sets a sad precedent and we intend to blaze our own respon
sible trail of integrity, axing the trees of inappropriate comedy. We Will confine our
efforts to the forum which best suits them. We refuse to hide behind a smokescreen
of attempted )ocularlty, which only indicates an absence of better ideas, a lack of ll’l’
tellectual capabilities and a total void of Journalistic skill.

To the Editor.

As we mark the tenth Alivlersary o/ the Crlniiell
Rclays i think no should pause to iellect upon the
real meeting oi this event

this event was not really intended as a spool oi
the Drake Relays

this event tvas not really intended to remind
everyone not to take ihamsclves too seriously

This event was not really intended as a drunken.
beer haccltanallatlllled weckcnd

this event was Intended as a showcase event
sponsored by the political 5(lence department to
prove that it really is better than the economics
department vcs, it must never be forgotten that
the real reason lor holding the Crrlrinell Relays was
nothing more than childish academic rivalry.
Nothing intellectual, nothing philosophical, lust
pctty arguments between two struggling
disciplines,

Legend has it that members of thc.poii-scr
department felt that ii they could be the recognizt
ed organizers oi an event like the relays, they
would, in turn, increase interest in political
sci ce as a mayor. lt was a Simple public relations
ploy,

So, as we all achieve new levels oi altered states
thrs weekend, remember, you're actually par-
ticipating in a media event. — sincerely, Governor

5&5 Editor'

The students have entirely too much lrccdoin at
Relays. ln iact, they have too much freedom
always. We must have uniloimed police at all
times, lightsout times and an cntirciy ore-chosen
course ior all oi them Also, they have too much
input in important grownup decisrons beyond
their limited capabilities. When I was their age i
didn't know what to do with my life. i still don't. 7

Dear 5&3

i am a male person, oi the sophomore class.
Although i spend most oi my time studying, l oc-
caslonally retire to the computer center for a
relaxing challenging game of Batnum or Rangar or
even the cvcrpopular Bulcow. i mention this to
show i am a With-it person.

Now, i have been known to have a glass ol
wine. But the debauchery achieved by many
Relaygoers is completely unnecessary i have
raiten seen such persons cavorting ioolishly about,
giving every appearance oi having iun. I believe
this behavior should be strictly discouraged grin
hell was not intended to be iun. the additional
time, energy and money could be devoted to
resurret‘ting the iowa temperance Unlon

Most oi Crinnell's current problems can be
blamed on an ovenndulgence in alcohol, For in
stance, the tuition hike can be traced to the 3d
bottles oi chateau Rothschild '49 served at the
party the trustccs threw when they were deciding
how much to increase tuition. I think you can
have yust as good a time with a couple oi cans oi
Mellow Yellow and its even the same color, Flnal-
ly, you’ll feel much better thc liext day, so you can
get right back to your books. a Melvin Studyhard
