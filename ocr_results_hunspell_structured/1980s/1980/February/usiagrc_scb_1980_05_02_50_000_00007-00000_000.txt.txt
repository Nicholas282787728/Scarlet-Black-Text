A rock takes a trip

This past Tuesday evening students
sat in Burling Library, quietly study
ing, absorbed in their work Almost no
one noticed the strange lights and
sounds on Hurling Lawn, fewer still
perceived the awesome momentilhe
rock had arrived.

It all began that morning, i had just
stepped out or the shower when the
phone rang. it was Brian Jones. "The
rock is arriving lodayl" he exclaimed.

“Hunh‘l”

"Just meet at 5:30 outstde oi Quad
and 1‘” explain everything then."

Brian, Bob Lewis, and I met at 5:30
and proceeded to a local gas station,
where we met the lellow who was go
ing to haul the rock back to campus
with his tow truck and flat bed trailer.
“NOW let me get this right. i.
ing to Brooklyn to get a rock
asked with a puzzled look.

"Not. just any rock, the rock of
1980,” I answered.

When we arrived at Kl‘iegel's farm.
Mr. Kriegel and his rearless tractor
were waiting tor us. The farmer and
the tow truck driver positioned
themselves tor the upcoming bout with
the rock. On one end oi the barnyard
the tow truck and trailer, and on the
other the farmer and the tractor, The

rock, with strength and dignity, calme
1y sat in the middle, detying the large
machines. Mr. Krlegel then began to
push the multi-ton rock toward the
trailer. After much pushing, and turn-
ing the rock with big chains (we put
the tractor through as many tests as
on one of those commercials). the
rock was loaded on to the trailer

We were then ready to begin our
journey to Burling Lawn, but due to
the weight of the rock, the tow truck
became stuck in the barnyard, The
skills ot the tractor were once again
tested, as the larmer pulled the tow
truck, trailer, and rock out to the
road.

As we drove through the streets of
Brooklyn, our procession was greeted
With looks of wonder and amazement
troni the local population, no doubt in
awe of our momentous project.

By the time we returned to campus
it was dark. We found ourselves on
Burling Lawn with a problem before
us: we had overlooked the last stage.
We stood there, looking at the trailer,
trying to figure out how to get our
rock oll. Pushing the rock was
useless, and Bob bent the trailer, .
rather than hudging the rock with a
crowbar. The tow truck driver, alter

some thought, decided he‘d try to
wrap the hook of the tow truck around
the rock and pull the rock off the
trailer,~Slowly, inch by inch, the tow
truck struggled, proving itself alter
the humiliation of having been stuck,
by pulling the rock off the trailer and
onto the lawn.

The rock now sits on Burling Lawn.
If all goes well the rock will be
engraved before graduation The

ing ceremony for Senior Sunday. May
