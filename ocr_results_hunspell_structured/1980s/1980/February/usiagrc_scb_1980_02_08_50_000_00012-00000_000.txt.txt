Sam Peckinpah has long been
known for the graphically portrayed
violence in his films. This weekend the
film which won him that repumtion,
Straw Dogs, will be on campus. The
plot centers around a man (Dustin
Hoffman) and his wife. They move to
the small town where she grew up and
she quickly earns the reputation ot a
cockrtease. A group oi very large,
very strong men iinally get tired of
being used by this woman, so they go
out to her house and rape her. What
follows must be the goriest hall hour
every ﬁlmed, as Hoffman kills all the
'men in increasingly violent ways.

‘ I don't want to come out in favor of
violence in films, but Straw Dogs is
more than that, it isn’t a movie with
,violence, it is a movie about violence.
As the violence increases the audience
sees Hoffman enjoy it more and more.
Peckinpah’s violence in this film (as
in, many or his others) can be in-
credibly seductive, it becomes a thing
or repulsive beauty. The audience is

Hoffman enjoys the violence,

The acting is superb, with Hoirman
turning in another excellent pertvrs

creative and satisfying. Peckinpah
likes to use slow motion during the

without a doubt one of the most powers

guaranteed to send you out of the
theater in a daze,

This week, for those of you who
couldn't tell, is Spanish Week, which
means that there must be a Spanish
Week Movievand there is...Cria,
the story of a young girl. There really
isn’t any plot to tell you about. The
film is made up of vignettes involving
this girl (age, about 12), her two
sisters (one older and one younger),
and various relatives. We see her live
through her parents' deaths, and we
see her try to kill her aunt (who she
lives with after her parents are dead).

Cria is a very well made character
study, but even the best made movies
can be slow in parts and this one is. It
is yet another case of “half as long
would have been twice as good."
Which doesn‘t mean that the movie ls
bad, it isn‘t. The acting is good all the
way around, including the three little

girls (and finding three young girls

who can act is quite a trick). The
direction is very good, and the
cinematography is very well done. It
is hard to’tind a technical problem
with the film, which probably con-
tributed to the {act that it won the

the iilm less exciting, When you get
right down to it, not all that much
really happens during the movie. I
kept expecting some really major
development in the plot, but it never
came. In short, Cria is an extremely
well made lilm in which very iittie
happens, but students of the Cinema
should enjoy it very much, It is in
Spanish with English subtitles

The third lilm [or this weekend is
the next installment oi the Ingrid
Bergman Film Series, the 1941 version
or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. liydo, starring
Spencer Tracy and Ingrid Bergman.
The plot is the same as it always was,
but there are some interesting notes
about the casting. Spencer Tracy, who
1 thought was incapable of making a
bad picture, was terribly miscast in
the title rolets). According to The
MGM Story, this film earned him the
only bad reviews he ever received.
The real surprise tor the studio was
Ingrid Bergman, who won great
critical acclaim for her role in this
film, which was originally to be
played by Lana Turner,
