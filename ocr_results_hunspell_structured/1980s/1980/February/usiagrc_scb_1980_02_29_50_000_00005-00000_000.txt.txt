MHousing irregularities draw student ire

The inequalities ot campus housing

like atmosphere here can make the
dissatisfactimis more obvious and less
excusable than those which occur on a
large mechanicallysrun campus,

Off-campus (non-college owned) is a

seniors and juniors who draw for our
campus housing generally get it, but
those who decide on this type oi living

privilege. This is where controversies
start with those who have been denied

Pam i-iuinick, oil-campus joint

with considering class standing as a

understood that Class standing is the
basis of dormitory room draw and
thus must pertain to all housing.
Director of Housing Susie wittpcnn
said some students don't realize
before coming here that they are re-

years—oll-campus housing is a
privilege. However, ireshman and
sophomores with special cirs

or married, are usually allowed to live
on campus.

The inequalities of onscampus housA

than do the off-campus situation.
Room S|zes and shapes are dillerent,
just as the physical conditions ot each
dorm room differ. Sophomores
notoriously draw small doubles and
cramped singles, but those who dislike
their positions can move as rooms
open up during the semester.

, Second semester generally brings
another type of inequality caused by
the drop in enrollment Many
students live alone in rooms classified
as doubles while others 'ind their

While Wittpenn admits there is a
problem, she tinds it hard to alleviate
the inequalities because moving some-
