Shining example of individual initiative

Not all solar research and develop-
ment is done by the guvenment, utility
companies, or wealthy eccentrics,
Last September Grinnell resident
William Rausch, who is an engineer
for GTE, decided to take what he had
learned from various magazine ar-
ticles and design his own solar panel
prototype Ii it worked, he hoped to
build a Whole set to meet most of his
home's space heating needs.

Rausch's solar panel, now mounted
on the roof oi his iront porch, is a 4 it.

Rausch is certain his prototype solar
collector is saving money. His heating bill

The purpose or the beverage cans is
