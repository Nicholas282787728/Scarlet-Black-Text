more career oriented than their 1969
counterparts.

The Grinnell student, as most of us
are aware, is not very representative
oi students at other schools. This is
conﬁrmed by the CIRP's data on 1969
attitudes. The report documents broad
differences between Grinnell students
and the aggregate sampliilg of those
at “tour year colleges” on political
orientation, public issues, personal
goals, and other areas as well.

Grinnell students' shift toward
pragmatism reflects the mood nation
wide. The change here is more pro

nounced because liberal and New Lell
ideals were so zealously embraced
during the period encompassing [he
first study. As a nationwide
phenomenon, it is reasonable to sug
gest that events of national impact are
the underlying cause in the retreat
from idealism. As the CIRP analysis
remarked, “One begins to see a pat-
tern of less idealism, less desire to air
feet the political and social systems in
the post-Watergate students of 1979.
Thls group is more likely to embrace
more traditional goals such as being
successful, making money, and Dblalnr
ing recognition from one's peers ”
