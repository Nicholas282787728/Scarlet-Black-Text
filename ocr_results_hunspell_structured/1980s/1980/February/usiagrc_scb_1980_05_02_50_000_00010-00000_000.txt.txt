In honor of

In addition to being Inauguration
Day, this Sunday is the tenth anniver—
sary oi the day on which the National
Guard, acting under the orders of Ohio
Governor Jim Rhodes, shot at random
into a crowd of antiwar protesters,
killing four students and giving a
ﬂeeting fame to Kent State University.
Many months ago, when I ﬁrst learn-
ed that the inauguration would be held
on May Fourth, l was deeply outrag-
ed, and vowed to have no part oi it. I
have since mellowed on three
grounds: First, Kent State is not [or
most Grinnellians the symbol of the
struggle against war and violence that
it is for me in a deeply personal way.
Second, it is unreasonable to expect a
college that can’t even remember its
400 Jewish studean long enough to
avoid scheduling Parents' Weekend on
the High Holy Days to take note of
anything so trifling as the gunning
down of college students ten years
ago. Finally, it is undoubtedly uniair
to make Mr. Drake surfer for what
was surely someone else’s brilliant act ‘
of scheduling.

Still, we should stop to remember
the [our who died on May 4, lino, and
especially we must remember what
they died for. Let us not make matters
overly complex in this regard: they
did not die ior socialism, social
justice, or free sex and drugs. They
died because they were loudly deman-
ding peace. ln this they were in pur-
suit of the noblest goal of mankind.

Kent State

We who wish to honor their
memories must not waste our efforts
in futile or meaningless gestures. De-
nouncing the holding oi inauguration
lestivities on May 4 or the building of
a gym on the shooting site will not
serve the cause for which the {our
died. Rather, this anniversary should
be a day {or quiet reﬂection on the
state of the quest for peace. in view-
ing such‘current crisu as the one in
Iran, we must struggle always to see
that peaceinot American honor, or
me deiense oi American interests, or

as his primary objective? Or is the
temptation to ‘send in the Marines’
likely to prove irreSlstible to him?
We must remember, too, that the
protesters ten years ago were
ultimately sucesslul to the extent that
their demands were simple and well»
expressed; they demanded a pullout
from Vietnam, and they got it, but the
vaguer demands tor a ‘dismantllng oi
the military-industrial complex' were
utterly ignored. No one will listen to
us today without speciﬁc proposals
behind which a movement can unite.

 

We who Wish to honor their memories

must not waste our efforts in futile

or meaningless gestures.

 

the justiﬁcation oi past American ac-
tions, or even the lives of the innocent
hostages—is our paramount national
concern. We must view every current
issue in the light of that overwhelm-
ingly important goal. at each
presidential candidate we must ask
ﬁrst, is this man likely to keep peace

Draft registration is an issue that
leaves many of us Cold; do we Wish to
declare that we are under no cir-
cumstances prepared to serve and de-
iend our country? A better issue, an
issue around which a larger Coalition
could be built, is nuclear disarma-
merit. In giving up the attempt to
rebuild Vietnam in our own image,
many oi us had hoped that we were
giving up we dream of America as an
imperial power. If that is so, we have
no need ior weapons that can bend the
world to our will. Rather, what We
need is a world in which such coercive
force does not exist. I would thus pro-
pose that the quest lor peace can best
be served by a dual approach: 55we
should register, or otherwise declare
our willingness to protect our country
should a real threat ever necessitate
that defense. But at the same time, we
Should declare that such a crisis is by
no means upon us, that if it were we
would still not be justified in
unleashing our nuclear holocaust upon
the innocent billions of the world, and
that therefore we can and should im-
mediately cut deiense spending by iii»
ty per cent or more. Without the new
bombs we build daily, we could even
aiiord to pay our soldiers a decent
wage and keep our helicopters in
working order. And the ghosts of the
Kent State four might rest a little
easier as we gradually iorget all about
them.
