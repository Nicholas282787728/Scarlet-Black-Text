Why we won’t go

There are two kinds of reasons why many Grinnellians and other youth in this country won’t
go to war in the Middle East or Central Asia. The first kind of reasons are what I call pragmatic'
reasons. Spokesmen from across the political spectrum have pointed out the danger and futility
of drawing lines in Central Asia. If the Soviets did make a move for the Persian Gulf there '
really 1sn t much we could do about it since we don t have a base to launch or maintain conven—
tional battle.

Another pragmatic argument' 15 that our sabre-rattling 15 just the thing to do to make the
paranoid Machiavellians in the Kremlin even more paranoid. Regardless of whether their
perceptions are right or wrong, the leaders of the USSR view the US as representing one kind . , .
of hegemony—through multinational corporations, the CIA, and political imperialism In a
world where they perceive the US as a manipulator, the Russians see themselves as playing
the same game, if a bit less subtly.

Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in a provocative and astute column published this week-in the Des
Moines Register, outlines the Soviet thinking behind the Afghanistan invasion. To the planners
in the Kremlin, Afghanistan represented a double threat. On one level, Schlesinger points out,
the former leader may be compared to South Vietnam’s Diem before the US had him bumped .
off: Diem and Amin both failed to satisfy the policy makers, so they were replaced.

On a second level, the Soviets are genuinely and properly afraid of the growth of Islamic Na-'
tionalism on their borders. And an increasing percentage of the native Soviet population is
Islamic. These Central Asian Russians could join with other nationalistic Moslems in the future
and the ‘white‘ Russians would like to nip this in the bud (They probably cannot.) None of this
justifies the outrageous invasion but it helps us get a clearer View of Soviet thinking

Finally, Schlesinger says that any Soviet attempt to take the Persian Gulf or coastal nations
would be met by a ferocious terroristic response form the entire Moslem world; there' 15 little
that' 15 easier to sabotage than an oil well or a pipeline.

These reasons help us see the ambiguity and inadvisability of becoming involved in a war in
Southwest Asia.

A second reason why we won’t go to war is ideological. The central issue of such a war would
be oil. (See Caplan letter) But our generation, spoiled and decadent as we may be, are coming
to the realization that the black stuff isn’t worth dying for, We would radically alter our
lifestyles before fighting a dusty war overseas. Some may say this is a selfish attitude, but why
should we give our lives so the arms manufacturers and the oil companies can continue to
benefit from our oil addiction?

The slogan of the 30’s may be “We’d rather switch than fight.” It‘s not that we are appeasing
Soviet expansionism, but rather we see the need for a balanced, coolvheaded response.
Machiavelli could advise no better.
