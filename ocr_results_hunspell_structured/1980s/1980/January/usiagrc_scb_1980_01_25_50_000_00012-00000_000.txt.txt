e Seventies:

open space

rejection of structure

It was the eve of Thanksgiving when
I wended my way through an im-
pressive crowd at the Pub, eager to
absorb the night's special festivities. I
found a place near the pinball
machine where I could fully exploit
the room’s unparalleled acoustical
mediocrity, and share in the crowd's
anticipation that something new was
about to happen.

As the entertainment’s spell took
hold, i watched with the wonderment
of a child when he first sees his
motherclimb out of the shower, as the
_Pub crowdiusually a hostile, if not
ugly mob~cheered and even danced
on the tables in favor of the perfors
mance. Indeed. something new was
happening. A phenomenon was taking
place, and in its present maniiesta-
tion, it was a group called The Den-
tists. The vocals were rough, the
lyrics were rude, and the music was
loud and aggressive. The Dentists
played like they were pulling teeth,
and their patients loved it. It occurred
tome then that there was much more
than what assaulted the ear. The
music—aptly labeled “Punk”—was
only one phase of a grand change that
was, and is. taking place. I’m referr~
ing, or course, to cultural change (due
term cultural revolution is better ap»
plied post hoe—years irom now I'll
write about cultural revolution, but for
now I’ll stick with change). Change
that is reflected in our culture’s ar—
tifacts, trends, movements, and the
theme of the times (zeitgeist).

The first change that struck me was
the crowd’s overwhelming en-
thusiasm: iar removed irom the type
oi apath the students as a whole are
often criticized for. Would a Grinnell
crowd have acted this way two years
ago'.7 And what of the James Gang
Bang and the Waltz—both with better

the implicit network of behavioral
guidelines, norms, mores, and rules
that tell us how to act, what to do, and
even who we are, For example, na»
tionalism is a form of structure, It
tells us we're proAmerican, we
respect the ilag, we‘re perhaps
distrustful of foreigners, and it tells us
who we are: Americans. But structure
exists across the whole spectrum of a
culture’s artifacts, and in order to
describe what 1 mean by a change in
structure, we must look at what was:
the 70‘s.

structure tells people how to behave
as members of groups and of society,
but the soscalled “Me Generation"
didn’t want to be members of
anything, they just wanted to be
themselves—whatever that means.
The Me Generation appeared docile
and apathetic when compared to the
turbulent 60's, but I find that View
misleading, The youth of the 70’s had
every bit oi energy per capita as did
their 60's counterparts, but the latter
group focused their energies upon
common goals, movements, political
activismithings that arouse public
furor. Later, individualism came in
vogue, and energy became seli-
cenlered. Group participation was out
because “being yourself“ was
in—even if that meant struggling to
diiier irom everyone and everything
Structure was on its way out,

The country‘s recovery irom a war
that no one wanted, the Pentagon
papers, and later, Watergate, made
being an American an unpopular no-
tion. The psychedelic movement,
though no longer hlazoned by the
press, was stronger than ever With the

drugs, A barrage of psychobabble and
selfrimpl'ovement therapies hit the

turnouts and what seemed to me to be
greater crowd involvement and en-
thusiasm than in recent years. Yes, I
do believe a change is taking place on
campus, an underlying trend that
manifests itself in events as seemingly
unrelated as the popularity of punk
rock and the recent appeal {or a dorm
for athletes.

This underlying trend is a change in
what I call “structure." Structure is

These things combined to attack,

structure.

Liie styles changed, too. The civil
rights movement tore down some oi
our structure‘s repressive elements,
and gays nationwide came out oi the
closet to develop their own lifestyles.

startling speed, structure all but

practice in the 70's, With abounding
allti~nationalism, narcissism legitimiz-
ed by a host of books and gurus, the

knew it), and a groping sexulaity like
that oi a Roman orgy, it’s no wonder
that critics called ours a hedonistic
society.

The movies, too. had their share of
me»ism: modernized Horatio Alger

Rocky, and Saturday Night Fever
assured moviegoers that the in-
dividual could overcomeibeat the
system, deieat structure, Even coma
edy reflected the trend to dissolve
structure, with leaders such as Chevy
Chase, Martin Mull, and most
notoriously, Steve Martin, whose
zaniness and meticulous avoidance of
social comment was practically a
comment in itseli. And, oi course,
there was the music. The psychedelic
movement had acid rock to kick off
the 70's. The vocals were rough, the
lyrics were rude, and the music was
loud and aggressive. The same
distinctions that characterize
Punkithe characteristic sounds of a .
new generation whose boldness serves
as Joshua's horn to tumble the walls
of the past era. I don’t believe the
vulgarity of punk is symbolic or didac-
tic: the Amerlcan representatives oi
this transplanted form of music have
little to complain about. instead, i
think Punk's aggressiveness is
necessary only to make It. con-
spicuous—which it has, conspicuous
enough to mark a new generation, a
generation which is tending towards
regaining structure.
