Walker: vandalism an atrocious waste

To the editor: I have not made a habit
of writingIto the Editor of the StitB,
Actually, as may be suggested by the
[act that this is the second epistle
which lhave_submitted in the last
twenty-two years, I rarely use to the
opportunity ior such public display oi
my illiteracy. What then is the
momentous occasion that would pro-
mpt me to break out oi my dozings
over my evening pablum and submit a
letter at this time? Actually, nothing
particularly earthsbaking. lWish only
.to make a few simple observations,
after which I promise to fall back into
my muse and probably not be heard
from again for at least the next eleven
years.

I noted. with interest, the campus
damage report tor the ”day period
from February 14 to March 2 on page
nine of the March 11 CAMPUS

MEMO. Since we have not attempted
to regularly collect data related to
these matters, I cannot say that this is
a small, average, or great amount oi
damage tor other ”day periods
throughout the academic year,
However, tor the sake ol discussion,
let us assume that it is an average
amount. With that basic assumption
as our initial premise, we then can ex-
ll'apolate the annual cost oi such
damage and make the lollowiiig
statements. The annual Cost of such
damage would iund any one or the
following:

(1) Full salary and fringe benclits
for one asSlstant professor

(2) TWO major rock concerts at tll‘Str
line qualit

(3) Purchase of 390 books for “it:
library at our average cost per
volume.

To the editor: I commend you on the
excellent FOCUS article appearing in
'the March 7, 1980, issue of the SKLB.

May I call your attention and that of
