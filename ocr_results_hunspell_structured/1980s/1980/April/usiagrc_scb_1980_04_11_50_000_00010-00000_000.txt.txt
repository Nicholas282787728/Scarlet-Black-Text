:g‘hese are the words which a score

ing-as the curtain rises on this spring's
Folkdancing concert, The literal
meaning of these Serbian lyrics,

Overall spirit with lively music, colorr
iiii o'stumes, and imaginative
choreography, the concert blends high
qu’ality style with an air of carefree
frolic.

' Which is as it should be. As the
name implies, tolkdancing has tradir
tionally been a social activity. per
formed for relaxation and on special
occasions such as weddings or
holidays. The communal spirit
associated with lolkdancing has made
it a popular activity on college cam-
puses across the nation.

- Grinnell is no exception. Recrea-
tional dancing began here more than
fifteen years ago, and as interest and
membership grew, the idea of performe
ing for those outside of the group
became feasible. Thus, in 1955, Grin-
nell’s Folkdancing Club presented its
first show. The success of that early
venture prompted further programs,
until the spring concert became an an
nual eventi Performances are no
longer limited to one a year, but are
held each [all during Parent’s
Weekend and on request for town
organizations or for special campus
events such as Slavic Weekend.

Yet the spring show remains the
high point. This year’s concert, the
15th annual, marks the amazing pro-
gress Grinnell's Folkdancing Club has
made since that first program. The
repertoire of dances has grown so er
tensive that a computer file is needed
tohandle it, Costumes, once a minor
detail, have become as important as
they would be to any theater depart-
ment. The folkdancing costume war-
drobe boasts over 300 costumes from
14 different nationalitles, all authen-
tically designed in the styles of the
countries they represent. The collec-
tion, begun only 6 or 7 years ago, is
completely the work of students. This
year alone, the 26 dancers will be
wearing a total at 160 costumes

Naturally, such a production re
quires time. Plans for the spring show
begin early first semester, as dances
are Selected and costumes sorted and
altered. Dances are taught to club
members all year long during infor-
mat practices in Darby and North
Lounge. There are no auditions for
shows; anyone who has learned the

10

dances is free to participate. The only
requirement is dedication, As the
show approaches, rehearsals become
longer and more frequent until club
members are dancing 3 to 5 hours
every day.

Choreography also takes much plan»
ning. Folkdances were originally per-
formed in wide open spaces, with no
audience to worry about, and they
must be adjusted to [it the stage in
Robert’s Theater. To give audiences
the best possible View, a team of
choreographers have planned varied
approaches to every dance such as
short lines weaving in and out, circles
movmg inside each other, and so
forth.

Variety seems to be the key to this
year's show. The dances represent 13
nationalities, including Russian, Scan-
dinavian, Armenian, Turkish, lsraeli,
and Arabic, The addition of Arabia's
“Danse Orientale,” commonly known
as belly-dancing, is an innovation
which should delight many.

There is also variety in the moods of
the dances. The show begins with
groups of dancers strolling on stage to
represent a village festival. It then
runs a gamut of playful, graceful
women‘s dances, flashy, boot-slapping
men‘s dances, boisterous circle
dances, and romantic couples’ dances.
Humor and hijinks set the tone, as
dancers flirt outrageously,
lightheartedly mock each other, and

encourage the audience to get in the
Spirit with claps, Stamps, whistles,
and yells. Says one member,
“Folkdancers are performers who enr
joy themselves onstage while making
sure the audience has a good time as
well.” In fact, the whole show is one
big party to which everyone is invited.
~Furtherlng this festive atmosphere
is the traditional faculty dance, in
which students are partnered by their
favorite faculty or staff members.
This year’s special guest list includes
professors Cloud, Cervene, Fienborg,
Hunter, Steele, Magurshak, Pipal,
Solis, Stone, and Turnbuli; R.A.’s
Barb Gaddis and Jeff Montague,
French Assistant Phillpe Szeles, and
Dean of Student Affairs Janet Car].
The dance, an old American favorite
known as the Salty Dog Rag, should
provide some amusing moments.

The show runs from 7:30 to 9:30 bath
Friday and Saturday nights, and for
those who arrive early, Ken Turnbull
and John l-layes will provide pre—show
entertainment from 7: 15 on. They will
be joined by alumnus Dori Weeda and
friends, playing accordion guitar, and
balaika muSlc. In addition, the Marimr
ba band will entertain during inter-
mission. The three groups, playing
music from the British Isles, Eastern
Europe, and Latin America respecc
tively, round off this presentation of
enjoyable folk culture which no one
Will want to miss.

Weekend ﬁlm feast

Due to circumstances beyond my
control (my reviewers didn't make
their deadlines) I am forced to write
this week’s film review.

Barry Lyndon (Saturday, 10:00,
ARI-l; Sunday, 3:00, ARI-i) is F. Hud-
son Miller's favorite film, but it still
might have some redeeming qualities,
