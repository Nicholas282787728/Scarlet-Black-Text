Bridegroom: “Out of the realm of reality”

by Erlr Rasmussen

The Grinnell College Theatre will
present Alfred Uhry's The Robber
Bridegroom this Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday at 8:00 p.m., in Roberts
Theatre, as its tinal major production
of the 1979-80 season,

The musical, which was nominated
for a Tony Award in 1976, is set in and
around the town 0! Rodney, Mississip-
pi. The townspeople or this small com»
munity enact a piece of the town's
history~a legend. All oi the pars
ticipanls live in the town and all are
on stage all of the time.

“It‘s very much of a group eilort,
everybody participates," comments
director Jan Czechowski. ”The prin-
cipals have an audience built into the
play as well as the theatre audience."

”Since the play is a legend, it is a
lantasy at base," Czechowski con-
tinues, “It‘s so out at touch with any
sense 01 realityithe things that go on
are totally unreal, which is why it’s so
much fun.“

Cast members are not only
characters but are responsible [or
creating the scene. Not only do the ac-
tors shift props (boxes and boards
become beds; a bench and two boxes
become a horse), but at times become
props: An actor holding two branches
becomes a tree.

The plot centers around the robber,
played by Tapobrata Ghosh, who leads
something or a double existence. He is

both Jamie Lockhart, a swashbuckling
townsperson, and a robber of the
woods who disguises his face with
berry stains.

.lamie saves the wealthy landowner,
Clemment Musgrove, played by Larry
Finder, from being robbed and killed
by the evil Big l-larp, played by Andy
Mennick, An added illustration of the
play’s being out of the realm of reality
is the tact that Big Harp is nothing
more than a head in a trunk.

As the play progresses. Jamie
Lockhart (as the robber) meets up
with Musgrove‘s daughter Rosamund,

played by Barbara Dunn, in a torest,
steals all of her clothes and runs
away. Eventually, a love attair
develops between the robber of the
woods and Rosamund—who doesn't
know his true identity until much
later.

“The play is melodramatic in a very
tongue-inrcheek way,” Czechowski exA
plains. “From an audience standpoint
it really is a run and involving play.
Alfred Uhry is something of a
specialist in southern humor. It is a
strange, interesting humorithere is
so much energy on stage that it spills
