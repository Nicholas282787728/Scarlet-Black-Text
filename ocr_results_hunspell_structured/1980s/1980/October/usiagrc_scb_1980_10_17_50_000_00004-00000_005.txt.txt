Fate

Today is not my birthday,
not- is tomorrow,

yet eventually

the day will arrive

and then I will not be able
to force feelings at late
from my mind.

—- Eugene Cam

An Autumn Musing

Today the sky was a kindly color.

—Det:eiving.

For behind it’s azure beauty

lay the portent of cold, silent sleep,

The lazy-headed Chrysanthemums

yielded to the frigid blasts of wind.

Nodding in imprudent favor,

-0blivious to the consequences.

leaves, like sacrificial virgins,

hurled themselves to the ground.

Surrendering in a final splendor of brilliance.
Only to he trampled and smothered by
Winter’s crystal veil.

Even the animals, who expired their Summer
afternoons sporting and prattling among
themselves, were husied acquiring sustenance for
the approaching struggle—Being chastised tor
their previous frivolity.

This was reality. This was truth.

All else; the graceful hues, the allurement, the frolick,
—was but a delusion.

And walking home, I found myself disheartened
with this urgency of gathering in. I stood,

in defiance one last time, feeling the chilled,
bitter slap of my toe.

There was no point in resistence,

Like the leaves and the flowers, I, too,

—had been conquered,

—David Dellart Abarr-

in training

i knew
things would have to end
this way

I smile
and say I understand
(and I do)

you tell me
how nice I am
(have I heard that somewhere before)

we kiss chastely
and part at your door
l go to my room

and listen to songs
of loneliness
and cry

~Chr‘tstine Wagner
