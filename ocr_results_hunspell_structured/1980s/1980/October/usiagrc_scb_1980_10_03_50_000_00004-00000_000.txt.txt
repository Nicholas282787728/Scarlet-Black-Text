FOG problems explored

. by Mom Mann

Unusually long lines at certain meals
which result In. extended hours (or
:workers, stall organizational changes,
and the re-assignment or two student
workers (or lack of a proper attitude,
have suriaced this year as problems
plaguing students and their meal pru»
vider, Food of Grinnell (FOG),

According to FOG director, Dave Mc-
Connell, longer lines typically exist at
the beginning oi the year but this year
the problem is persisting. Although
North Campus has approximately 600
people on board and Souui has about
400, the total number of boarders has in
creased only slightly irom last year

However, the 865 students enrolled in
i1 a.m, classes on Mondays.
Wednesdays, and Fridays ”have
created extremely long lines on those
days in particular." said McConnell, Of
these students, approximately 170 live
off campus, leaving about 70 percent at
the boarding population eating lunch at
noon. Serving lines move at a max»
imum ten people per minute, while the
dining halls have a seating capacity of
360 people at Cowles and 235 at Quad.

“There is no quick solution." said Mc-
Connell. “I've spoken With the Dean
and Vice President regarding class
schedules and the Registrar is current-
ly compiling a tile orthe number oi
studean in each class period, the pur-
pose being to rearrange enrollments to
lessen the line problem.

"Nothing can be done this semester.
but hopeiully something will be change
ed for next semester,” added McCons
nell. He also suggests that students
Without an 11 am. class go to lunch
before II :45 am. to help ease the situa-
tion,

Tuesday and Thursday lunch hours
have been changed to open at 11:15
a.m., but McConnell said that opening
the dining halls earlier on other
weekdays would not help, “primarily
because there is no or only a nominal
line between 11:15 and 11:30."

Concerning long lines at evening

meals, especially at Cowles, McConnell
said, ”We're not completely sure why
Cowles’ lines ﬂuctuate." Quad's line is
normally over by 6 p.m., some five
minutes before the meal closes. FOG
posted sings urging people to walk from
Cowles to Quad. But the strategy hasn‘t
worked, explained McConnell,
”Because people tend to eat habitually
with the same group."

Several factors contribute to longer
dinner lines. “Every year the majority
of boarding students are new students
and they tend to take longer in line,“
Said McConnell. Also, selection of food
could take more time this year because
of the larger range at entrees oiiered.

Athletic teams that iinish practicing
at 6 pm. create long lines at Cowles
around .30 p.m. When teams getoutof
practice late, student workers must
stay longer to serve them, creating pro-
blems [or the stall. "They used to close
