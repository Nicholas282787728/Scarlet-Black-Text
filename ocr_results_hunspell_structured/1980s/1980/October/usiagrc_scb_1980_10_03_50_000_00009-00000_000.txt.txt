Aposue runs the publishing company
ut of the basement of his home here in

rinnell, and his wife, Margaret, ”runs
he whole business," according to Apes»
le, She serves as secretary, treasurer,

since his retirement a couple oi years
go Apostle has been spending three
ours a day, seven days a week,
anslating and writing commentaries
in the work oi Aristotle. Apostle starts
is day on early and has been doing it
or a long time, ”I like to be
.isciplined," Apostle Said, "It becomes
i habit and then you like it. A certain
mount oi regularity ior anybody isn't
iad.”

Apostle explained that he liked doing
esearch on scholarly works and that

taculty to do research and publish, This
is a new idea at Grinnell and 1 like it,”
Apostle said.

Having been at Grinnell 32 years,
Apostle has seen a lot of changes take
place at this college. He was asked to
make some general comments about
the college and the community. He
started off explaining that he liked the
people and the atmosphere here. "I lind
the people are not provincial; they have
a wide attitude," Apostle said. He also
said that the faculty and facilities of the
college are better now than when he
first came here.

When asked to comment about the
students he has seen over the years,
Apostle leaned back in his chair and
contemplated the answer {or a while
Then he said, "The students in the late
'605 wanted to do what they pleased.
They thought that morality was an in
dividual matter. They wanted to be
tree, but they really didn‘t know what
they were saying.

"You see, they said on the one hand
that morality was an individual matter,
while on the other they were against the
war, thinking that it was immoral. But
they were contradicting themselves, If
morality is an individual matter, then
they had no right to be against those
that felt the war was moral, aside from
whether it was justified or not. Now
they (the studentst are sobering up."

merits irom Apostle on a variety oi subf-
jects. *

On Philosophy: “1 round in my early
days that modern philosophers aren’t
enough descipiined. i think this is part:
ly because they have to attend to other
necessities, like teaching too much," I

On Education: “I wish that we had
something like the ancient Greeks had,
like Aristotle's Lyceum. A place where
research could go on without the need oi
material necessities which disturb the
mind. We do have something like this at .
the Princeton institute oi Advanced
Studies, but I would like to see more,
lt's important to our civilization.

0n Foreign Policy: "My greatest
worry at the present time is Russia and
the Mid-East. ll Russia gets the Mid
East and squeezes Europe because ot
their necessity [or oil, we may be in [or
World War ill,"

on Politics: “It’s only my opinion oi
course, but 1 think Carter is more anx-
ious to be in the White House and less
anxious to run the country in the right
manner. He is weak, indecisive, provinn
cial, and doesn't perceive relations
among things, Hence, he contradicts
himself, He is the worst president we've
ever had.

Reagan is not suiiiciently iniormed
and there is a question whether he can
appoint good advisers. it’s a bad Situa- .
tion; 1'” choose the least of two evils." 9
