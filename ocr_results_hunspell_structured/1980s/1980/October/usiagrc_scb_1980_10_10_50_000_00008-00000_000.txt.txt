,lN FOCUS

At the 5&3 our main responsibility as the campus newspaper
is to inform the campus community of what’s going on. The IN
FOCUS section is designed to take an in-depth look at one topic
in order that we may better fill our mandate. This week we
decided to look at the Student Government Association (SGA)

cabinet. As the leaders of Grinnell’s student government, it is
their responsibility to organize and carry out the actions of the
SGA. They also play a major role in dispersing the almost

$100,000 SGA budget.

This set of articles is intended to introduce you to the people
who make up this cabinet and to get a glimpse of what their

thoughts and ideas are.

As for the job that they are doing, one cabinet member sum-
med it up by saying he felt that the cabinet “hadn’t had a lot of
tests.” You will have to decide that question for yourself. We
hope that by getting to know who your SGA officers are through
this article, you will be able to make your decision with a little

more knowledge

Keeping the calendar full

by Richard Leichl‘ngel

As SGA'S social coordinator, Chris
Nylander is in charge oi the Concert
and Film Committees and is co-
chairperson oi the Campus Coor-
dinating Committee. He also sits as an
ex-ol'ficio member of the Public Events

Committee. Nylander explained that he
is, in general, “in charge or social pro
gramming on campus, as far as SGA is
concerned."

“It‘s my job to see mat we have tull
weekends with a calendar that runs
smoothly and remains set,” Nylander
said.

Since the iaculty’s rejection of sons
proposal to have one spring Skip Day
took place, Nylander's ottice is now
responsible for organizing the {all Skip
Day. Joint Board had determined that
it their resolution that they presented to
the taculty was rejected they would
then go ahead and hold a tall Skip Day.

“I thought that we had brought a
reasonable compromise to the laculty."
Nylander said. But as a result or the
“no-vote" Nylander now says that
“there will be a {all Skip Day. It will be
held outside of the SGA office. because
we can't use the Forum. There will be
bands and I think I can guarantee that
there will be beer,”

Although Skip Day will now be taking
up much at his time, the major part at
his job still consists or organizing cone
certs and films, and the major problem
that Nylander says he {aces is the
budget, “We've actually had budget

“I’ve got to have tun being son p
dent or there is no reason to do it. T
has to be a certain perspective t
job it you want to accomplish what
set out to do "

These are the words that SGA P
dent Paul Volker uses to descr'
feelings about the post he was elect
last spring. He is optimistic about i
his administration and what he ho a:
get done this year. The lirst s
weeks of this semester have air
seen several moves take place.

A major project has been the dev-
ment of a case to request an increa
the Students Activity Fee. the sour
SGA funding. SGA is currently su
ing trom a tight budget and part of
problem is blamed on the [act that
Activity Fee was not increased f
'last year‘s level. A preliminary cas
an increase will be presented to
Trustees this (all, with another pre
tation planned tor the winter hu.
meeting. “I‘m confident." said Vol
“And the administration has also b
very supportive oi our request lor a
tional running."

An issue which is less important
more visible IS the recent Skip l
resolution. The resolution. asking
faculty approval of a spring Skip I
was voted down by about a 21 mar

cuts while the costs of concerts and
lilms has gone up," Nylander explain-
ed.

“Our concert program has been hurt
significantly," Nylander said.
“Because the cost at touring is so high,
we are paying more {or groups that ace
tually aren’t as well known.” As for the
ﬁlm end at his job. Nylander explained
that a similar type or situation was oc»
curring. "We have been hurt a little by
costs‘wlth the films. But I Still think we
have a strong program overall,”
Nylander said.

Nylander went on to explain that he
felt it was time to consider raising the
Student Activity Fee. "Right now it's
too low a percentage or the tuition." he
said.
