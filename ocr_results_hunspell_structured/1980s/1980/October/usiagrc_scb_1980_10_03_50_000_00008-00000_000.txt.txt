Hiding in a corner office on the se-
cond ﬂoor of Carnegie is ﬁle office of
Protessor Emeritus oi Mathematics
Hippocrates George Apostle. But what
makes this professor somewhat more
special is that he is one of the world’s
foremost authorities on Aristotle and
that he has been at Grinnell College for
the past 32 years.

Born in Greece in 1910, Apostle‘s
lather brought his family to the United
States in 1922 intending to make money

, in the United States and then go back to
Greece, But later on his father decided
to stay in this country and raise his
family.

The Apostles lived in New York City
where George (which is the name that
he goes by) attended high school. When
asked how he became interested in the
subject of mathematics, Apostle
responded, “Mathematics always
came naturally to me and l was on the
math team at my high school. We used
to compete with other high schools in
the city, and we usually won,”

in 1932 Apostle went to Columbia
University where he eventually receiv-

8 ed a B.A. and Masters degree in

mathematics. From 1935 to 1939 he was
a student at the University of Chicago
and it was mere that he became in-
terested in the study oi philosophy. So
in 1939 he want to Laval University in
Quebec where he received' a “En
Licence Philosophie” tan equivilant to
a PhD),

Apostle then went to Harvard to get a
PhD. in philosophy. “It was a very
prestigeous place," Apostle explained,
“And when you go there you are
assured oi a position. But the second
World War was on and everyone cared
about math. So I had to decide whether
I wanted to go to M,I.T. and work on the
bomb or teach,"

In 1942 Apostle went to West Virginia
Wesleyan where he taught physics,
math, and science. "That tirst year I
was teaching a triple load, as contact
hours," Apostle said, “But during the
war everyone had to help."

Alter teaching at other universities,
Apostle came to Grinnell in 1948‘ "I
taught mostly math courses and one
course in philosophy, on Aristotle and
Plato," Apostle explained. "These two
lellows were the most important, most
articulate They were Wider in scope
than anyone. They were more scientitic
and had greater intuition.”

it was at this point that Apostle got -

the idea to begin to translate the work
of Aristotle, He explained that he felt at
the time that the existing translations
ot Aristotle were “inaccurate, unscienr
title. and misleadlng "

“They distorted the thoughts of
Aristotle," Apostle, said, .“Being a
scientist I thought that l.couid do a
scientific translation with, scientiﬁc .
commentaries." And since i963 that’s
exactly what he has been doing. To»
date, Apostle has translated (with com ~
mentaries) Aristotle‘s - ”Physics." v
"Metaphysics," “Ethics," and ,,
”Categories and Propositions "

Most recently Apostle ha's fin'i' ed
translating “Posterior Analyti
Aristotle sphilosophy ol science, which u-
should be released in June. “It s Aristo~
tle's most important work,“ Apostle
said. “It shows how Aristotle is still‘
relevant to modern science, A great
many or the insights still apply today."

Apostle has also taken it upon himself
to reconstruct Aristotle's “Philosophy
of Mathematics," since the original »
document was lost. “it's a statement
about organization or subject and .,
method,” Apostle said.

What Apostles ultimate goal is in ,
writing these translations is to create ,
one book of “Selections" of Aristotle's ,
work that can be used in college
classes. But he was having trouble gels
ting the rights (ruin the publishers to
take parts irom their books to use in his
book of selections. So Apostle created
his own publishing company

“Mrs. Apostle and I said ‘let's go into
business',“ Apostle said. "I wanted to
bring out this book oi selections, com-
bining parts from each of Aristotle's
works. So that we don't have to worry
