Beckett beckons

by Eric Rasmussen

Samuel Beckett has a compulsive

need to express the expression that
there is nothing to express, nothing with
which to express, no power to express,
no desire to express. together with the
obligation to express. He was awarded
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969
and his literary output, including plays,
novels, stories. and poems, has earned
him the reputation of being one of the
great writers of our day.

A 22 member ensemble will periorm
“Pieces of Beckett" this Saturday at 2
pm, and 8 pm. and Sunday at 2 pm. in
Arena Theater The ii dramatic pieces
iorm a representative cross section at
the genius or Beckett.

Considered major works in the
literature of the absurd, all of Beckett's
pieces present a comically pessimistic
allegory of man‘s condition. As Nell
says in Endgame: “Nothing. I grant
you, is funnier than unhappiness."

In Act Without Words. (directed by
Rachel Slavickl, an actively hostile
Void threatens to invade the tiny ter-
ritory oi man (Nancy Goldman). Man
goes through every possible mime ac-
tion, every possible permutation and
combination of elements of the void,
and in the end he's left with nothing to
do. It is man in naked contact with his
creator. Conversely. Act without
Words ii (directed by Goldman) il-
lustrates humanity, (represented by
Slavick and Sarah SanfordReinbold),

ultimately man's life is curcular.
Waiting ior Godot tdirected by Eric
Rasmussen) is a tragicomedy about
two tramps, Vladimir (Didi-Pamela
Schultz) and Estragon (Gogouudy
Kintner), who are continually aware oi
cold, hunger, and pain. They quarrel
and contemplate suicide, separation,
and departure. but remain dependent

‘ on each other and never do anything.

Beckett s Endgame (directed by
Beth Boerger and Rhonda Mayer) will
be performed both in the original
French tKaren Cole, Will Gleason,
Tracy Thoma, and Andy Winters) and
the English lEoerger, Cindy Field, Jim
Hunter, and Mayer). The Fin du Partie
is that moment in a chess game when a
minimal number of pieces are left and
two possibilities exist for the next
move: 1) the and comes or 2) an infinite
series of moves is intitiated.

In Play (directed by Ellen Measel a

in the universe is perhaps no more than
