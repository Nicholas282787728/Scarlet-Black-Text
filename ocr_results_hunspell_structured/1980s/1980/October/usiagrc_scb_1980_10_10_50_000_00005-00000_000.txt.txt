Profiting frOm politics

by Ellen Heath

in the heart ot downtown Grinnell, at
the top oi a [light at steep wooden
stairs, is a large oliicc titled with boxes
and papered with posters, The boxes
hold hundreds oi political campaign
buttons and the posters display the
faces and slogans oi assorted presiden»
tial candiates, This is the home of the
Iowa Button and Badge Co.

Steve Elkin, a Grinncll College
senior, runs the campaign button
business. He does everything from
designing to advertising to distributing
with occasional Clerical help. Elkin has
been collecting campaign buttons and
owns 8000 to date, In 1976 he decided to
go into the business or selling them. By
selling buttons at Republican Convene
tions Elkin has developed a mailing list.
Everyone on the list, mainly
Republicans and collectors, receives a
copy of his catalogue from which to
choose their orders.

Most of the buttons Elkin is Currently
selling are pro-Reagan. They include
pictures of Reagan and Bush, the best-
seller, and a photograph of Reagan in a
cowboy hat, Elkin's favorite. A button
which reads, "Carter . . . once is
enough," occupies a prominent place in
the catalogue. He also sells some pro-
Carter and Anderson buttons.

Elkin says people like to buy from
him because he offers a wider selection
than the campaigners can aiiord to pro
duce. His orders average 325 ior 2025
buttons and are sent out daily.

Elkm works with two different com-
panies to make the buttons he designs
and also buys pre-des'igned products
lrom five to seven other companies. He
has occupied his office downtown since
August ol this year and will deiinitely
keep his business in campaign buttons
through December.

Although Elkin will graduate at the
end of the current semester. he wants to
stay in business here afterwards. If
Reagan is elected President. Elkin
plans to start a line of inaugural items.
But if not, he wants to expand the Com-
pany beyond campaign buttons to
advertising items tor businesses such

as McDonald's

advertises in iiiiericnii Spectator. The
New Repuhl and iiuniaii Events.
Eikin writes his own copy and his most
successful ads have been with Human
Events, in which he runs a different ad
each week.

Elkin attended the Republican Con-
vention in Detroit this past Summer and
set up his button booth, When it looked
like Reagan was going to name Ford as
his running mate, Elkin called one of
his manufacturers in Chicago and had
them make up 2000 Reagan/Ford but-
tons. The buttons were made im-
mediately and he received half of the
order the next day by express delivery.

By then, however, it was evident that
he had made a mistake and Ford was
not chosen. Remembering how he had
spent over $1000 on the order, Elkin

Sleve Elkln and his pruducl

said, “i thought i had lust my shirt."
But he displayed the.buttuns anyway
and, much to his surprise, they sold
very quickly. The buttons were con»
sidered collector’s items and Elkin sent
Tor the rest oi the order, selling all but
about 50 buttons. Because of this feat,
Elkin and an associate. Mark Whitman,
were interviewed on the ”Today
Show."

The Democratic Convention also pro-
ved quite protitable tor Elkin. After
hearing Kennedy’s speech he made up
“Kennedy ’8‘)” buttons and they sold
very well.

To‘ keep up sales and increase his
mailing list, presently at 1500, Elkin
takes periodic road trips. He went to
Texas three weeks ago and is planning
to go to Ohio this week or next.
