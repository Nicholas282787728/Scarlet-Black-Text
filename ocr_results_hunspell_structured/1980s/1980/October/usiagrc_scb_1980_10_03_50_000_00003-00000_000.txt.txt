Food for the masses: 1,962 bagels

by Barb Rilter

Mark Liberson perceived that he was
getting ripped oil The Forum was
charging him so cents tor a grilled
frozen bagel and when he decided to
give Peppercorn's a try, he was doubly
disappointed, Not only were Pepper
corn’s bagels irozen, but they were also
six months old.

Liberson, a lreshman at Grinnell, in-
sists on quality, especially in his bagels,
He decided something had to be done,
so he looked into the opportunities
available topmvid‘e the campus with
wine fresh- baked bagels at a
reasonable price The Nosh, a Des
Moines deli, provided the answer and
Libersorl formed his business enter-
prise, Bagels Ltd.

The rabbi who runs The Nosh gave
Liberson a fair deal on freshrbaked
bagels, lox. and cream cheese, Liberr
son buys the bagels at wholesale price,
they are baked Friday alternoon, and
Liberson picks them up and delivers
them to campus by Saturday morning.

Liberson though he might iind a
small faithful following on campus who
would be interested in ordering bagels
through him. He also hoped to pick up a
little bit of money along the way whlch
would assist in paying lor college,

So, on Saturday, Sept, 20, campus
mailboxes were stuffed wiﬂl informas
tion about the new serVice and posters
were put up in strategic locations.
Liberson optimistically expected about
600 bagel orders, but the requests began
to flood in. By Wednesday afternoon he
had received orders {or 1,962 bagels.
Liberson 'was “pleasantly surprised."
It seemed that a quality and inexpen-
sive bagel service is just what the cam»
pus needed. .

Although the deadline for last week's
orders was explicitly stated as Wednesr
day noon, orders filtered in throughout
Wednesday and Thursday, The Nash
was contacted and Liberson geared up
tor the big event that would take place
Saturday. He hired several students for
transportational, packing, and sorting
purposes, paying his workers in dozens
ol bagels He had to set aSide several
hours each day to total iigures, number
order slips. and decide the best possible
method of distribution once the bagels
arrived.

Bagels Ltd. had originally promised
delivery to everyone, but once the
orders began piling up, Liberson decid-
ed hewould have to ask for help from
the campus by requesting that people
pick up their own orders in the post of-
tice. Notes were placed in mailboxes
about his plan on Thursday, Sept. 25,
Saturday morning iound Liberson openr
ing up the trunk ofa green Mustang and
unloading bags and bags at bagels. The
post otiice smelled like a bakery by the
time his tirst customers came in to pick
up their orders.

Liberson said Saturday's post oiilce

distribution oi the bagels went well;
everyone who ordered bagels received
and paid lor them. Although it may
seem surprising that Liberson would
take orders iiom a hungry campus for
bagels which weren't paid for yet, he
says he "trusts people." “Bestdes, it
they don't pay, they don‘t get their
bagels," he added. Well, everyone paid
and everyone got their bagels,
Liberson had not only solved the cam-
pus problem oi late night munchies,

he‘s started a popular enterprise that .

has many possibilities for change and
growth. Having met With such “a
positive response," Liberson is
“presently discussing expanding to
other colleges and making Bagels Ltd.
a Mid-Western wide business."
Grinnellians showed a friendly in
terest in the man behind the bagels, as
Liberson received several inquiries and
personal comments on the back oi the

nellians; some orders were for one
bagel—obviously from those with either
limited funds or discriminating tastes.
Another interesting request came from
one student who bought {our dozen
bagels.

Those who ordered bagels are in good
company, as some of the notables on
campus seem to have a thing for the lit-
tle gems, too. French House tops the list
with 35 bagels ordered; other sales
came from the math department, PEC,
Director oi the Library, Director of the
Alumni Programs, Office of College
Relations, several Carnegie offices.
and Fell House.

Liberson, enjoying great campus sup-
port, is looking forward to future suc-
cesses with Bagels Ltd. “I’ve enjoyed
