am Just old»Iaslii0lied, but in the
September 19 issue oi the 5&3, in an ar-
ticle entitled “SGA passes Skip Day
resolution," one very disturbing phrase
appeared: “Joint Board highlighted its
meeting lost Wednesday with a discuss
n concerning the once—popular Skip
Day." (Emphasis mine)

I had not been aware until now that
‘w‘kip Day is still not popular, Time

kip Day used to be a student run

The taculty became concerned with
skip Day when important classes were
disrupted, i know, I was in the biology
class most affected (Thank God} ). The
administration still did not particularly
care, but the professors were so strong.

ﬁle administration bowed to their

,wishes.

Enough with the history lesson.

Now Join! Board has offered to only
have one Skip Day in the spring ~ hilly

When the spring Skip Day becomes
:ess popular, how long will the college
have that one?

You the students are paying for Grins
nell's services. If every student decided
that school could be skipped one day
(even classes with exams) there would
he no class. Is that so impossible? We

are talking about 1200 rather
homogeneous students, not New York
City. One day does not an education
maker

i like two skip Days. Then again, I
like pot, student input (ha, ha), and a
fully academic school with less ems
phasis placed on other pursuits. Ah
well, those are part of a once popular
past.

Goodbye Grinnell, Your emphasi

tense to me, but I am sure it is pas

In my column 1 did point out the cur»

points out the excessive use oi conjunc-

gone a step iurther: he has nothing to
say, and he says it poorly. Lacking the
proper tools with which to vent his
anger, he resorts to a shallow attack on
mycharacter, instead oi examining my
ideas,

l-iis anger is real, however, and quite
justiﬁable, As a math major he was 011
{ended by my address to his “ilk," and
chose to ignore the denigration or my
own kind ~ e.g., “the dregs oi the
Humanities,“ Such a narrow focus rein-
forces my fears.

My call for divisional requirements is
made with people like Burnett, and
mysell lor that matter, in mind. We are
unable to see beyond the limits of our
disciplines, and wind up attacking
many ideas which are in our self~
interests.

Ridicule is a favorite weapon for both
of us, I make reterence to my personal
version oi the classical liberal arts. The
quadrivium (arising from the root
meaning tour) include history,
Political Science, Philosophy, and
Literature. The trivium (arising,
naturally, from the root meaning
trivial} include all Science courses.
Math courses, and any Social Science
course which relies heavily Dl’i math.
The joke, olcourse. has been on mysell.

I will graduate in December with 124
Q‘edits, of which 112 could be classified
as “reading/writing." I have never
done a lab; nor have I had a class in the
Science Building. I managed to ace
biology in high school through {ear and,
much to my detriment, have avoided
the subject ever since.

Tomorrow I will take my GRE's. I do
not stand a chance on the quantitative
