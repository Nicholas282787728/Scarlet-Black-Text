Marlin Luther King. Jr.:‘
A svmlml 0' ”3308

Amidst the confusion and excitement of the returning hostages,
we sometimes forget other events which are no less important to
our development as a nation One of these events occurred on Jan.
15 ~ the commemoration of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther

King, Jr.
D

On the 15th blacks and whites again joined hands as they did
during King’s life, only this time for a symbolic reason This year,
as in years past, people from across the United States rallied in
Washington, DC, to ask Congress to establish King‘s birthday as
a national holiday. From the Des Moines area alone over 3,000
signatures on a nationally distributed petition traveled along with
the Iowa delegation Even the popular music star Stevie Wonder
contributed his monies and energy. In fact, in spite of the rejection
of a bill by the 96th Congress, the bill was reintroduced recently in
the House and a similar one is planned for the Senate.

Although most of the Grinnell community was spread far and
wide on the 15th, many of us heard about the rallies which occur—
red in DC, Atlanta and other parts of the country. Let us, as Grin,
nellians, add our voices to the rest, for King advocated not only
civil rights, but peace between all humans, all over the world Let
us, as Americans, show the rest of the world that we won’t pay lip
service to these values any longer by recognizing King’s birthdayl
Let us make Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. the first black to finally
be nationally honored, just as we honor other great leaders from
our past.
