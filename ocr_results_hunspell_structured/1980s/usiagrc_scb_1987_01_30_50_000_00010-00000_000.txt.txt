"The preponderance oi away games has
somewhat distorted our record By and
large, we have played pretty well " These
kind words by coach Gar Smith regarding
the ups and numerous downs of his 3-10
basketball team are hopefully as realistic
as optimistic, From the coach's stand-
point, at least, this does appear to be a fair
assessment. as the Pioneers have con-
tinued to improve deiensiveiy, and have
received valuable Contributions from the
bench. -

These improvements were reﬂected in
the Pioneers play at the onset oi their
winter break schedule, as they out-iought
Cornell 79778 in overtime But after this
brief Celebration the rest was downhill, as
the team dropped iour straight games. a
iough way to spend vacation,

Despite these “shortcomings," coach
Smith manages to main|ain his omniscient

grin oi approval. The coach was pleased
with his squad's periormance against
William Penn: Grinnell lost in the last 30
seconds on their home court. “Except ior a
couple oi halves. we played well.” The
dismal results make one wonder about
the Coach’s standard oi “playing well.”

Uniortunately (the password oi the
Pioneer’s season thus iarl, the end oi
winter vacation did not mark the end of
their losing streak. Last weekend the
pioneers dropped a doubleheader, slice
cumbing to both Beluit and Ripon. As
always, however, there is room ior 0p-
tirnism. Ripon is very strong, at 12-5 on the
season. and the pioneers were handicap-
ped as guard Eric Whitaker was out with a
hurt ioot. Coach Smith isn't about to make
any eicuses. however; he knows iuil well
that his team has the necessary ingre-
dients to be successful.
