We' II Keep You Posted

The Safety Committee, a group
formed as a result of the Rape and
Harassment Open Forum, is in the
process of implementing the pro
grams it developed last semester.
Matt Rickett. the chair
of the committee, gave
me some details before
break. The longrawaited
whistle program will begin as soon
as the whistles have been distrib-
uted. They were paid forby lastse-
mester’s Fog Fast. In the future,
the Student Affairs office will buy
and distribute whistles at the be»
ginning of every school year.

The Safety Committee has also
designed a campus safety handout
that. among other things, contains
a campus map with well-lit routes
highlighted. Student advisers will
distribute these in the ﬁrst week of
February, approximawa the same
time the whistles are distributed.
And speaking oflights, there have

been three more lights installed be
tween the Fonim and the science
building. In addition, all the exte-
rior Forum lights are now turned on
every night.

Also as a result of the
open forum, Student
Affairs now has two
female counselors avail-
able forrfemale victims of harass
ment or rape. Student Affairs has
also been keeping a master log of
harassment repons in the ofﬁce,
They hope this will serve a number
of purposes, First, it will enable
Student Affairs to see if a trend in a
cenainkind ofharassmcntis taking

_place: racial. homophobic, etc. It

will also enable them to know where
most harassment takes place: off
campus, South Campus, Human/
Gay Resource Center, etc In addi»
tion, this log will keep track of how

Against the Grain

Just when you thought it was
safe to go back in the water,
“AgainstTthrain"is backwitha
whole new agenda of topics. This
semester we’ll have the regular
weekly topics, but watch for some
extra-special columns during Gay
Pride Week and Peace Week.

To start the semester off right,
I‘d like to reﬂect on an
incident that happened
not too long ago in
Stockton, California.

For those of you unfamiliar with
what I am referring to, about two
weeks ago a gunman armed with
an AK-47 assault rifle and two pis-
tols opened fire on a schoolde
full ofkids,killing fiveandwound—
ing 30. There are other details of
this incident that I will bring up
later in the column. The gunman
killed himself with one of his pis—
tols as soon as he was out of
ammunition for his assaultriflc, .

Predictably, almost as soon as
news of the incident reached Sa-
cramento, members of the state
Assembly began looking into gun-
control legislation. The big popu-
lar‘movement seems to be banning
or limiting the sale of semi-auto-
matic riﬂes. The movement is
supported by the gunvcontrol lob-
bies and many democratic assem-
blymcn, but is being opposed by
the NRA and other gunvadvocacy
groups as well as by Governor
Duekmcjian.

Gun-control groups always use
the same approach, the idea that
making guns more difﬁcult to
acquire will reduce crime. Pistols
and automatic riﬂes already have
required waiting periods. Semi—
automatic and single-shot guns
may besold over the counter. Two

important points that come up here
are lhal the Stockton killer bought
an AKM47 semi-automatic rifle
and illegally converted it himself to
an automatic AK—47i Nosemi-auto—
matic riﬂes were used in Ihc Stock-
[on killings. The gunman also had
two pistols. That means that he had
passed the waiting period test and
just as easily could have
bought an automatic riﬂe
even with the waiting
period. How effective.

Now to the issue of gunroontrol
in general. I’m a strong opponentof
gun control fora number of reasons.
First, every individual should have
the right to use whatever force is
necessary to defend himself (or her-
self), and his family. The idea that
strict controls keep guns out of the
hands of criminals is silly, since
criminals don’t acquire their guns
legally. If you want to keep armed
criminals off the street, give them
Iongersentences. TheStochon gun-
man hada long criminal history. If
Califomia had ajustice system like
Texas had a while ago, that is. on
your third conviction they throw
away the key, the killings could
have been prevented.

Waiting periods are a good idea,
assuming a Iaw~abiding citizen
doesn’t have an urgent need for a
gun. lknow ifI lived in Miami in
one of the neighborhoods where the
riots occurred I wouldn't be too
thrilled tohavetowaitlodaystoac-
quire a gun. (By the way, I thought
it was sort of silly for race riotets to
burn down a black culttn-al center.)
I know that ifI gota phone call one
afternoon and somebody said they

'were going to come over to my

house and kill my family I sure
wouldn‘t be too thrilled about haw

ing to wait 10 days to acquire a
gun. The police can‘t guard your
house all the time and it is the
right ofthc private citizen to de-
fend his household.

Now, how about gun control’s
reducingviolentcrimeordomes-
tic violence? Whataboutknivcs,
or large blunt objects, or garv
totes? If somebody wants to hurt
somebody else, they are going to
do it. If they don‘t have a gun
they'll use a knife. You’re a lot
better off being shot in the gut
than being stabbed in the gutwith
a kitchen knife.

What aboutall the gun-related
accidents? Any NRA member
would be happy to recite for you
all the safety mles regarding gun
handling. If safety mles regard-
ing guns are followed, there is no
chance of an accident's occur-
ring. People have accidents be-
cause THEY aren't being safe.
We don’t ban bleach because
some little kids get into a bottle
their parents left sitting on the
floor. It isn’t theproduct’s fault,
it: the person's.

Finally, I know that if there
wasanarmedintruderinmyhouse
who was endangering the safety
of my family, I wouldn’t think
twice aboutblowing him away. I
don't care it he is a victim of so-
ciety and had a realty terrible
childhood. Every citizen has the
unalienable rightto self-defense.
Ifsomeanti-gunactivistfeels that
guns are unsafe, nobody forces
him to own one. He has no right,
however, to “protect" me from
the “dangers" of gun ownership
ifI feel said ownership is neces-
sary to ensure the safety of my
family.
