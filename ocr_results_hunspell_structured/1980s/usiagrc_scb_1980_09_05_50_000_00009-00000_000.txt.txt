later the government contlscuted all
the property, auctioned it oil, and used
the proceeds tul‘ lhe war effort

"The thing that was hardest lor me to
b l'eve though," Rev, Ogata recounted,

the breakdown in law and Dl‘der
that was occurring."

Then, in July of 1942. (liter qur and
one half months at living at the track.
the enemy aliens were moved by lra'
to their permanent "relocation camp

"There were 300 people on the train,
Men in boxcars and the women,
especially the pregnant ones iol whi
there were 181. in passenger coaches
ogata went on to explain that he was
made the orderly tor the train. "They
just put a redccross armband on me and
lwas to serve as medic lor out) people!"

ogata had had no medical training
and he said that he was "saved" by {our
registered nurses who were also on the
tram.

The train trip was a rough ride over
the Rocky Mountains to Arkansas.
where they linally reached Camp
Rohwer in Desha County. "It was a 1000
acre site where they had built army
barracks," Ogata said. "Each barrack
was 8018a long and 50 leet wide. They
sectioned il oil into five rooms, one for
each tamily.

“Believe me, there was no privacy,
There were beds and nothing else. We
were permitted to go to the city dump in
the tovm oi McGehee to look 101' things,
but only when we were with armed
guards.“

According to ogata, who spent three
years in th - mp, lite was "nothing
glamorous. We were given jobs; we
worked eight hours a day and were paid
$19 a month. They gave us food, but
everything else had to come train that
money."

Ogata explained that the people in the
town would give them the "silent treat-
ment." but that the soldiers who
patrolled the camp were extremely
lnendly, "They couldn't understand the
government‘s actions either," ,

In lurther describing the atmosphere
inside the camp, Ogata said that,
"there was a small group that vented
their anger, but most everyone ac»
cepted the situation as being a result ol
war hysteria,"

ogata was permitted to leave the
camp, He went alone to Chicago where
he worked in a lactory making gun
mounts, But the rest at his lamily
wasn't released until alter the Victory
over Japan in 1945

“The government gave us no money;
you were on your own," Ogata explain-
ed, iThe government did attempt to
make some restitution m the late 40's
They altered to repay onertentl’l ol the
losses incurred. But Ogata pointed out
that most ol the people were too stub-
born to take the alter at tlrst. By the

“I felt that it was just a rumor,

that it couldn’t happen in a free country ”5

 

time they decided that they would take
the money, the iund had run outi

So Ogata worked two jobs tor \6 hours
a day to be able to bring his lamily to
Chicago, and later to pay lor college.

"During the ii ~things looked bleak
lor me," ogata said. "When i was is or
its in Japan 1 tell the urge to serve
humanity in a ministerial cause. I had
looked up to the American missionaries
in the country. But i also knew that to

become a minister I‘d have to have four»

years ol college, and then three years at
the semin' I didn't know how I'd
ever make it '

ugata did make it, He pushed through
school _on the money his vviie made
working as a secretary ior the dean at
the school he was attending.

Alter many years as an associate
pastor at churches around the lows
area, he settled ln Grinnell. where his
daughter, Lynn, is a junior at the Cole
lege.

Recouiiting his thoughts at the time ol

the internment, ogata expressed no Ills
ieelmgs. "I lelt no animosity against

my own country. I had the reeling that;
eventually it would all be justified. I:
also had no divided loyalty during the.
War either, I lelt 100 percent:
American." ;

Asked if he was bitter about his ex-'
perience Ogata explained that the
"Japanese culture has a saying that:
says that no matter what happens;
there is nothing we can do but accept it,;
and I do. -

--l am sad about having lost tour.

so much—that there was so much:
wasted time." ‘ .

The only thing that ogata does icel;
strongly about is the deSire to get an oIr-
licial apology lrom somebody in charge‘
at the time. Acknowledging that it‘
would be difficult because of the_
amount oi time that has passed, Ogata
still feels that it would make a dil-.
Ierence. "All I would really like is for_
someone to say ‘we made a mistake,‘
