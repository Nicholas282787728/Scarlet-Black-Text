“My first job is to get thoroughly
acquainted with Grinnell." emphasized
the college’s new Dean of the Faculty,
Dr. Catherine S, Frazer “I don't want
to rely on hearsay when making
decisions ”

Although (‘il‘innell President George
A. Drake announced Frazer’s apr
pointment in late March, she did not
assume her post until Jilly. “I’ve done
some talking to iaculty members and
others,” said Frazer, “But i want to do
more since my sample is limited, due to
August being prime vacation time "

Frazer carelully asserts she harbors
no plans for reforms or changes at this
time, however, she does offer her Own

Another way to add structure is through
advising," She added. This is Grinnell's
current method of diversifying
students’ curriculum.

She does suggest faculty members
make an effort to improve their un

own discipline. One way to reach this
goal . she claimed, is to “embark on a
variety of ways to make sure professors
make contacts with their colleagues."

months to a year to lind out about how
the informal mechanisms work around
Grinnell," she said. “There's no paint
in my re-inventing the wheel and I'm
not interested in ramming things down
people's throats.”

On re-institution of the Frgrzide.
which gained the faculty vote of ap-
proval in the spring nt 1979. but is still
under study for implementation, she
said she is concerned with maintaining
the integrety of the transcript without
being punitive of the student. However
she stressed, ”I've worked in all sorts
of grading systems, the last one being
CR/NO CR with wrlttten evaluations,
and we found our admissions to
graduate schools proﬁled the same as
other institutions of our Standing ” “I
don’t think grading is a mean thing to
do We're graded all our lives," Frazer
emphasized. “But 1 do think it’s impor-
tant to be clear about how a grade is
given." -

Frazer believes Grinnel] offers a
good opportunity tor students to design
their own majors, however, she said, “I
think you get out of it only what you put
in.” Therefore, she believes proper
advising plays an important role. She
also stressed. ”I'm available to help
any student who thinks he has not
received proper attention,“ and en-
couraga all students to seek her. out for
assistance because “The proper func-
tion of the Dean is to help students with
their academic directions."

The Dean also plans to seek the
opinions of students on academic
matters through meetings and
discussions with the SEPC’s . “1 want to
hear where they ran into difliculty and
where they felt they were effective,"
said Frazer. “I think they can be very
helpful advisory units and that student
input is one kind of input which should
be considered,"

Frazer's duties also include working
with the provost of the college in
determining the library budget She
promised to “give high priority to the
library as a teaching resource." Frazer
admits she know little about the current
status of Burling in terms of com-
prehensiveness otthc collection or any
other lactors. but stressed her Wish to
“take an active part in advising" the
library on policy and purchasing
matters. “Like any academic
bookworm 1 take an active interest in
the facility," Frazer commented, “and
1 think the library will get a fair shake
under my administration,"

on a historical note, Frazer
responded uni-.ivorably to the revival of
Skip Day. 0| the ”free day" which
occurred twice each year until the
laculty voted against during the spring
or 1979, she said, “It may go dormant
for a while until someone spontaneously
thinks of doing it, but l’m not very
partial to organizing spontaneity.”
