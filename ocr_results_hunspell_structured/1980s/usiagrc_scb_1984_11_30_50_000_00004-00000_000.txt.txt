Rule of Pinochet -

violence and censorship

In 1973, Us. covert support of a staged military coup
overthrowing the democratically elected Socialist
government of Salvador Allende, brought the country of
Chile to its knees. Thousands were rounded up and tor»
tured and/or killed in the Santiago Stadium in the capital
city. Democracy was abolished in the name of US. cor-
porate interests, The rule of fascist General Augusto

Pinochet was established.

It was not until years later that the true brutality of the
coup and the nature of US. support for it began to be

recognized.

Salvador Allende was a very popular leader of his peo-
ple, democratically elected and overwhelmingly sup-

ported.

General Pinochet, in power 11 years with much
assistance from the US, is finally becoming desperate
as Chilean opposition to his rule becomes militant and
widespread Pinochet has reacted to months of mass pro-
tests and the recent national strikes (November 2128)

with increased brutality.

On November 7, he declared a state of siege and step-
ped up army patrols of streets and arrests of civilians.
This past Wednesday it was reported that heavily armed
troops and busloads of police were patrolling the streets
and rounding up dissidents. Complete censorship has
been enforced. All reports of unrest and protest have
been banned in Chile. Foreign reporters are being
prevented from operating within Chile. There has been a

total news blackout.

While we wonder, in the absense of on-the»spot reports,
what is happening in Chile, let us not forget the thousands
who died in Santiago Stadium. Let us not forget the
thousands who are once again being “detained” in the
Stadium. Let us ponder how the US. can take pride in
making the world safe for democracy.

Guatemalan repression

by Robert tin-lay

One cannot begin to understand
the Central America question
without studying the history of the
region. Moreover. any historical
study of the isthmus only gains
legitimacy when one reaches
beyond the prejudices and
cultural letters carried by the
North American and European
writers. However. the aggregate
which presents itselt upon a study
of both camps can be quite pro-
ductive and enlightening. These
are the thoughts that inspired the
following briel history .ot
Guatemala.

As of the end of last May it was
estimated by the Mexican governr
merit that upwards of 43.000
Guatemalan refugees had entered
Mexico over the past tive years,
tleeing the repressive regimes of
both Central Rios Montt and his
successor General Mejia Vic-
tores. The question that im-
mediately comes to mind is. Why
on earth doesn‘t somebody do
something bout it?

Last April 30. approximately 200
Guatemalan soldiers attacked a
refugee camp in Mexico near the
Guatemalan border. torturing and
killing a group at relugees. One
six year old boy was beaten to
death. Mex'C' n outrage was met
by an otticial statement iroin
Guatemala on he troops \iere
leltist rebels masquerading as
soldiers at the Guatemalan army,
The tragedy seems- to have ocr
cured in response to Mexican
plans to move the camp further
away from the border in order to
insure the salely oi its ills
habitants.

Guatemala has a population

that is more than 60 percent In-
dian. and much like the apartheid
practiced in the Republic of South
Attica. the indigenous population
lives in a state Dl extreme l‘eprcs-
sion, The historical question 0i
most importance is nmi. as in the
past, a question Oli land. The in
tligcnous population in Guatemala
comprises almost entirely ol
tarniers working tor the nlost part
towards the subsistence of the
tamily. No other vocation. save
weaving for the tourists, is within
their grasp. Generally speaking,
they received neither schooling
not any kind of vocational train-
ing.

This overwhelming disparity
between the opportunities open to
the lndian. and those open to the
white man. is rooted precisely the
strong tradltion of racism and
white superiority nurtured since
the advent of the Spanish conquest
in the 1500's. This is compounded
today by the tact that the majority
of the land. in effect the best and

most easily cultivated land. is in.

the hands at a tiny part or the
population who use it to grow cx»
port crops, A large portion 0] llle
population can no longer support
itself, and thus has tied the coun-
try because their protests are con-
tinually quenched with violenceal

Armed Forces.

iiiinistration. which destroyed the
only sincerely l‘cltlrnl-mllldcd

government that Guatemala has
ever witnessed.

ln W44 the dictatorship ol Jorge
Ublco Castaneda was overthrown
and Juan Jose Al'evalo became
the first democratically elected
leader oi the Guatemalan people.
During the next ten years.
Arevalo and his successor Jacobo
Arbenz Guzman. also popularly
elected, attempted to constitute a
wide range at radical rei'orms.
The primary motive was to
redistribute the land equitably
among the Guatemalan people.
They hoped that by doing this the
Guatemalan economy could be
weaned from its dependence on
export crops, tocusing instead on
staple crops that would teed the
country's inhabitants.

Untortunately. the massive exV
propriation and redistribution oi
land included nearly 400.000 5
of crop land owned by the United
Fruit Company: the giant b
corporation that dominated near-
ly all of the Central American sntl.
as well as parts of South America.
