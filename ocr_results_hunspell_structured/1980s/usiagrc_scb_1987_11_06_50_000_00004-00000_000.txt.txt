We kept on drivmg By late mor-
ning. we had made it into
Maryland,

One or the highlights or the drive
was making s ns ior the van win
dows like. We're going. are
you and “We are family." It
wasn't long beiore several other
cars with people heading to
Washington started honking at us
and waving as they passed. Our ei-
citement grew with each ear that
passed us. and we started screams
ing and waving in the windows

lambda tsymbols oi gay pridei.

Around 2 P.M.. we arrived In
Columbia. Maryland, where we
were housed ior Saturday night by
the parents of Jillian Kong, a Grin-
nell lreshman who was on the trip.
In the aiternoon, we took turns gets
ting cleaned up and changing, and
then had a wonderful home—cooked
meal. our first real food in over 7/1
hours.

Right alter dinner, we headed
downtown, into the heart of DC,
Getting oil the Metro at DuPont
Circle, we only had to walk halt a
block before running into the first
sizable groups of openly gay pens
ple. We were heading towards
Lambda Rising, the largest gay
bookstore in Washington. and the
closer we got, the more gays and
lesbians there were, People were
lined up, waitingtlo get into bamb-
da Rising just to browse. As we
waited In line. several members (if
our group were alilieted by a state

time in their lives its symptoms
include a permanent iooliShs
looking grill and such statements
as Scott England's comment, “I've
never seen so many gay people in
my entire lite!”

People in the bookstore were
talking about the events connected
with the march that had already
happened. such as the Gay Weds
ding. in which an estimated 2,500
gay and lesbian couples exchanged
vows in a briei ceremony to
celebrate enduring samerscx z'cla»
tionsliips and protest the lack or
legal recognition ol these relations

Alter spending some time. and
money. in Lambda Rising. we
headed back out to Columbia to get
some sleep bciore the next day.

W

we woke up early and drove into
the outskirts of D C , where we left
the vans. and took the Metro into
downtown. We walked to tho
Ellipse in iront oi the white
House, wearing our March
T-shlrts. which we had all made
betore leavnig Iowa. We had about
three hours before the march
started. so we wandered among
the crowds and booths set up
around the edge at the Ellipse

march

stretched ior 12 blocks Getting up
on each uther's shoulders, we
couldn't see the end of the crowd
behind us Even though we got to
the rally after it had started. we
were there when one oi the
organizers ol the march mentioned
Grinnell. Iowa. iirst in a list oi
places people came irom. The
organizers informed us that while
niiicially the crowd was estimated

)icture to publish in his school's
iewspaper,

Noon came and we all lormed up
n the street around the Ellipse.
iecause oi the huge number of
narchers, it was almost two hours
ietore, we actually started on the
porch route. We spent our time
vaiting by singing songs like “We
ire a Gentle. Angry People,” ”We
shall Overcome," and “Come On
Jul And Deviate Wildly.” which
was a creation oi a student there
rom another school, and by chan-
.ing “2, 4, e, 8, how do you know
your kids (folks) are straight.”

ranging irom “My Parents Forced
Me To Come," and “l‘m here

Jackson included Cesar Chavez,

Instead oi attending classes. we
were still driving. The long trip
gave us a chance to reflect on the
events oi the weekend. Many times
during the march we had been ap-
proached by Grinnell alumni, in-
cluding Rn). Baker. who were
amazed at the number at Grins
nellians at the march and at the at
the accomplishments made by the
Gay Community on campus, such
as the Resource Center. We bought
newspapers at every stop, looking
Ior articles about the march. when
we got back to Grinnell, several oi
us went on a quest to find a copy oi
the October 12 issue oi The
Washington Post. in which senior
Jeannie Rowe was quoted as say-
ing, “We wanted to represent the
college and show that there are
gay people in Iowa,"
