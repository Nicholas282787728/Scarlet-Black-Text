 

hat Overwhelming

Question. .

The other day a friend came up with an
interesting distinction between the art and
biology departments at this school, He said
they both bring in live models to draw. but
in the former they cost you, while in the
latter they are free, This got me thinking
about some incidents in which I’ve been ins
volved ﬂiis semester which prevent me
irom keeping my mouth shut any longer.

First of all. I'm an English major, so
none of this would seem to have any
significance for me. I should be content to
sit in my carrel mumbling, “Out, out brief
candle, life’s but a poor playeri . and
complaining about the lack of Allen
Ginsberg’s poetry books at Burling. But, in
fact, through the wonderful advisor/ad-
visee system at Grinnell (which can coax
even the most stubborn of humanities
bulls to lake the 101 Plunge into the
science department) and by being denied
scholarship money (Yes, I have bared my
body to art students for a modest $4 an
hour), I have become informed about both
the art and biology department’s lack or
plethora or monetary funds,

In other words, the art department is
broke and the biology department is load-
ed. When I talked to an art EPC member
about why they had run out of money for
models (and so had begun to charge a si
fee for the Wednesday night drawing ses
slons) they had used up the $100 allocation
granted by Initiative Fund. She informed
me one hundred dollars was more than
they had received in previous semesters,
and they were quite grateful ior this grand
sum.

when I told her the biology department
didn’t run out of money for live marine
organism models, indeed, did not have to
schedule extra 7 to 10 pm. drawing ses-
sions of starfish and sea urchins (using In-
itlative Fund money), but instead had
these sessions in class and for free, she
was shocked, “And the sea anemones don't
even have to keep still!” she squealed.
“Just imagine how long I would last as a
model if I squirmed on the platform like
one of those sea cucumbers!"

There is definitely a problem here. The
question is: What is it about the selence
department that gives it the right to send
out for live mosses and pickled crayfish
and charge no lab fees, while’the art
department is thankful for outside money
even if it does run out lalong with drawing
paper) before the semester is over?

My answer is somewhat nebulous,
somewhat speculative. This is mainly

Mart/9a Silano

because I don’t want to go to the biology
department and ask.

Sure, I could find out the price of one of
those squids we dissected, but that’s not
really what i want to know, Rather, the
question has to do with necessity. and I
think I can predict the answer [would get.
Again, does a department that has too
much money (yes. too much. Iwill not use
names, but there is atleast one professor I
spoke with who couldn’t quite figure out
what to do with his/her allocated funds and
ended up buying a law books and hiring so-
meone to do work that didn't need to be
done) have the right to spend it by letting
every lab table dissect its very own
grasshopper, snail, clan-i — especially
when another department has $85 lab fees
for one of its courses? (Not to mention the
fact that: a) massive dissection is obsolete
when plastic models are just as good, b)
the actual cutting away ofskin and muscle
is not as important as seeing the guts ins
side and one organism is sufficient for this
and c) marine organisms are threatened
enough by pollution and oil drilling without
the help of fleshaworshipping college
students) -

OK, the nebulous answer: Science
doesn’t have to defend itself anymore. In
early times, the tables were turned. If you
spoke about science you were burned at
the stake, called a heretic or at least
denied computer access. But since science
has proven to be a more workable alter-
native to confession and Hail Mary recita-
tions lIndeed, it's more fun to spend
money on bottled capepods than an Easter
outfit) it is no longer questioned.

Art, on the other hand, is a very bashful
discipline these days You can't work in a
lab with a degree in art. Looking at pain
tings won't make you iinancially secure,
indeed, a iigure drawing session is not ex»
acuy a prerequisite for getting to dress in
white and say, "breathe. . breathe. ,
breathe. . . ” while holding a stethoscope to
someone's chest, Art is not going to save
the world, It can't even save a life. How
dare its studenB not he charged lab fees!

I'm just saying these things should be
looked into 7 that these questions that T.S.
Eliot called “overwhelming” should be
asked. By allocating more money to
science than art, Grinnell tells its prosper
lives, What kind of student it is looking for
If we don’t start appreciating art around
here, we’re going to find this campus ﬁlled
with 1200 formaldyhyde-tingered students,
and we won't be able to boast about a
diverse Student body anymore,

Congratulations to the

Classof 1983-
Best wishes to you!

Views——
Core Curriculum —
Can’t we do better
than this?

Curriculum Coordinator Morris Parslow submitted to the faculty
last week a proposal that would institute as few as 20 or as many as 40
credit hours of curricular requirements in upcoming years. Parslow
wrote that his submission was “a draft, a working paper that invited
your criticisms.”

Here are some of our criticisms: ,

First, Parslow’s contention that, “The requirements represent skills
and knowledge that the faculty generally seem to believe our students
should seek to acquire in die course of a liberal education” is fine, but it
does not deal with the problems that exist in academic advising today,

Instituting required courses instead of improving a weak advising
system will not provide the inherent improvement that better advising
will bring, Why aren’t Grinnell faculty members helping their advisees
to make better course selections to achieve their liberal educations?
Having adViSOl‘S and advisees working more closely would produce ef»
fects far more desirable than any set of curricular requirements.

Assuming that some sort of requirement package is approved, and
possibility certainly exists, we ask why these particular changes were
suggested. The proposal deals with “Sloan Levels" and such nebulous
concepts as “problem solving," “mathematical modeling," and “ap<
plied math,” The courses suggested under these headlines already ex-
ist and are quite popular. The need for these particular suggestions
just does not exist because students are already involved.

If Parslow’s recommendation was going to do anything constructive,
it would have changed or even eliminated U16 Freshman Tutorial. The
worthless exercise in waste that passes for a tutorial could be used to
guide the freshmen along a uniform, well»designed program that would
start them on Grinnell’s road to liberalism. The tutorial might be a
good place for me student to gain exposure to the computer system and
obtain other worthwhile skills.

We must question the motives and priorities that apparently went in
to me decisions that made up the package. Why, for example, are there
eight credits required in one lab science? Why eight credits in one
social science'.7 Why only four credits in all Non-Western studies?
Where does diversity fit into this scheme?

Finally, the section of the proposal dealing with foreign languages
leaves us scratching our heads. It is admirable ('l) that the proposal
does not force students to take a foreign language, but the reason of—
fered seems weaki “Since the student/faculty ratio in most of these
sections is presently at or above a desirable maximum, such a require-
ment could entail adding as many as seven additional faculty members
to the departments."

This statement reflects a lack of responsiveness that could cause big
problems in the future. If there is a trend developing among the
students toward foreign languages, why doesn’t the faculty change to
accomodate it? The same goes for any steadily growing department.

Also, the lack of a language requirement seems surprisingly out of
place in a proposal which seeks to help students acquire a liberal
education. Without knowledge of a foreign language, or more impor-
tantly of the Classics, 3 curriculum can hardly be called liberal or
educational.

The report to the faculty raises more questions than it answers,
which may be good. The biggest question, though, remains, “Where is
Grinnell at today, and where is it going tomorrow?”
