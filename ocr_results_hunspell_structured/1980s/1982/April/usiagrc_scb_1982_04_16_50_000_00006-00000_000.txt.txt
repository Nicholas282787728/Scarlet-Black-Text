WEEKEIIII MOVlBSI

All American ill
Pal-ls

Directed by Vincent Minnelli llSSll
Starring Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron

Sat., loom, ARI-l: Sun, a p.m,. ARH i113
min.t

Begin with the unbeatable music of
George Gershwin: throw in Gene Kelly's
amazing dancing and choreograpghy, then
add the “Minnelli touch." Finish with
opulent yet tasteiul technical teats plus
fantastic costumes and scenery. The end
result will be the sensational, academy
award winning An American in Paris. This
film takes the well worn boy meets girl
story and turns it into an exciting musical
experience.

It's hard to say what gives this lilm the
creativity and appeal which most high
budget musicals notoriously lack. is it the
dance patterns, costumes and scenery
working together to paint each scene in the

Chandlebaum's

style of a different French artist 7 Duffy,
Renior, TouluseLautree? Perhaps the
Gershwin score with dozens of his works
from “ ‘S Wonderful” and “Embraceable
You" to “Pﬂmo Concerto in F" played by
the Gershwin interpreter Oscar Levant?
Or is it the climax of the film 7 a
l7-minute ballet sequence, choreographed
by Kelly himself and uncxcelled as a film
ballet? The combination of all these things
offers a kaleidoscope oi Paris's landmar‘:s
and moods and makes this film unique,

it you're completely turned oil by iilm
musicals then An American in Paris isn't
for you. But ii you appreuate Gershwin,
Gene Kelly or just a good old movie, this is
the him to see. — Catherine lngrassia
