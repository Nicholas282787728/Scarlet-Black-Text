View onCuiler
from Florida

To the Editor:

Although Lynn Cutler needs no one to de
fend her bid for Iowa's Third Congres
sional Seat, 1 want to provide other
perspectives on the candidate than were
presented in Lee Ann Clayton's letter of
Sept. 24.

Having spent this past summer working
on a congressional campaign in South
Florida, I heard candidates iii slate and
federal races expound their views on
issues, especially the effectiveness of the
Reagan Administration and its policies, to
audiences of varying political opinions.
While it‘s often difficult to tell if a can-
didate supports the actions of the president
and his fellow Republicans and boll»weevil
Democrats, what is clear is that a signifi-
cant number of people are not satisfied
with how these actions are affecting them.
And when I saw other Candidates dilute
their pro-Reagan stances to please these
disgruntled audiences, I was reminded of
Cooper Evans, who has also moderated his
conservative views now that his consti-
tuency has become more liberal and his
ride on Reagan’s coattails has left him
stranded.

In contrast, Cutler has continued to ad
vocate most of her 1930 platform, with
some needed tightening of her position on
the economy. She has not waffled in her
opinions and has expressed her views
clearly to her audiences, without tailoring
her presentations to please specific in-
terests,

Besides her honesty, Cutler’s political
experience would also make her a more ef-
fective legislator than Evans In her role
as vice chair of the Democratic National
Committee during the past several years,
Cutler has proven her ability to work
within party and Washington
bureaucracy. The access she has had to
political and governmental information in
this position would make her, even as
a freshamn congressman, more
knowledgeable and more capable man
Evans could hope to be for at least several
more terms in diat office.

And, although only former President
Jimmy Carter could reveal who his
favorite county supervisor was, it's a fact
that Cutler was well-known nationally as
an effective supervisor for iowa's Black
Hawk County. My own candidate in
Florida's 12th District, a tworterm Palm
Beach county commissioner, and his peers
thoughout this area know of Cutler and her
work in Iowa. When I told other commis-
sioners I was from the Hawkeye state, the
invariable response was, “Oh, do you
know Lynn Cutler7 I hope you'll be in her
new district."

I do hope to have Cutler represent me in
Congress, because 1 support her clear
stands on issues and trust her record as a
county and national administrator. Iowa's
Third District will benefit from her ex-
perience and ability. Sincerely, Laura
Carter (in selfsimposed exile)

Straw election
unreliable

To the Editor:

The straw election held this past Thurse
day is not a reliable indicator of how
students will vote because it is not directed
toward those students who are registered
to vote in this district

Democrats may come out way ahead in
this straw vote, and many students who in
tend to vote on election day may not
because they will think support for
Democratic candidates will be so strong
their vote will not matter in the outcome.
The campus Democrats encourage all
voters to keep in mind that the results of
the poll will be Vastly distorted and to not
let its results deter them from voting on

SGA addresses
safety of films

To the Editor:

We are concerned about a seeming
disregard for die safety of others exhibited
by some audience members at recent
screenings of films in the ARH auditorium.
We have instructed our projectionists to
stop a film in progress it, in his or her
judgement, the behavior of the audience is
dangerous or inordinately disruptive.

Past incidents of such behavior have
limited our choice of films. Continued
disregard of the rights of the audience in
general by specific members will preclude
the future possiblity of showing any high-
energy films in Ann. Such films require a
responsible audience. 7 Sincerely, the
Student Government Association

Against Burking
smoking ban

To the Editor:

Within the body of this week’s Campus
Memo, we students were notified of the
decisions of the student/faculty Library
Committee and the adminlstration‘to not.
permit smoking anywhere in Burling until
second semester when enclosed rooms
can be provided in the basement, As a
smoker, I am obviously very upset by this
decision. However, it is not so much the
decision, per se, that upsets me, butrather
the use of smokers as a convenient excuse
to hide the real reason behind the decision,
and to avoid the real issue at hand,

The temporary ban and subsequent
limitations on smoking have been justified
by the Library Committee with respect to
“Protecting the college from fire damage
to 7 or possible total loss of 7 the library
building and its collections. . This state
ment is, however, not borne out by the past
and present actions of neither the commit-
tee nor the administration. I would offer
the following as examples: -

l, in the past, smoking was permit-
ted despite the possibility of damage to
either the building or the collection.

the collection were soaked and ruined

by leaks in the library roof.

3. The permission of students to bra
ing drinks and foods into the library has
caused irreparable damage to more
than a few books,

4, Burling, because of a great deal of
often foolish trust in their patrons,
“loses" a good amount of the collection
every year.

5. As a result of the recent “im-
provements,” the basement has flooded
at least once, to my knowledge, thus
creating a dangerous environment for
the collection.

6. With the addition to opening Wm-
dows to the upper stories of Burling,
heat and humidity will still play a
significant role in the deterioration of
the collection.

7 There are still “hot" electric
panels that are covered by no more
than thin sheets of plywood.

3. Once you let any matches, lighters
and especially cigarettes in the library,
the possibility immediately exists that
there Will be a fire.

Thus, if it is the committee and ad-
ministration's “primary concern" to pro-
tect the collection, they still have a long
way to go. I find it rather interesting that
they find this to be an overwhelming con-
sideration, when their “primary concern”
should be the protection of the lives of the
students! Everyone jokes about how Burlr
ing is a firetrap, but few have actually
stopped to consider how much so. With the
“necessity" of the limitations of smoking
and the inadequacy of the explanation that
has been given, some major defects of the
planning and construction of the library,
that smokers have no responsibility for,
are seen.

1, The “open" design of the first two
floors means that it would not take long
for fires stemming from any cause to
engulf the building.

2. As for the top two stories, once the
bottom two go, you can write off the
others as gone as well.

3. By the very “necessity" to limit
smoking to isolated areas, it is implied
that the building materials themselves,
expecially the furnishings, have a high
flammable propensity,

4. In addition to the “hot" panels
mentioned before, there has been ex-
tensive electrical re-wiring that con-
tributes to the possibility of fire.

5. in case of fire, escape routes are
neither adequate nor clearly
designated, There are only two internal
stairwells that lead from the fourth
story to the first, and these are both
very narrow and steep, Fire escape
routes have not been posted for public
knowledge, nor have there been drills to
determine how rapidly students could
escape This is, by the way, not just im-
portant for fires, but also for the more
common occurrences of weather
emergencies.

Is me issue at hand mat smokers are
dangerous to the collection, and therefore
that smoking should be limited? I don't
think so. I and the other smoking users of
Burling are being discriminated against
because of inadequate planning, etC,, of
the library. Other libraries are perfectly
able to accomodate smokers and non»
smokers without serious risk of loss of life.
why, when the reconstructions were being
made, could this not have been con-
sidered?

Another point of rather narrowrminded
thinking of which the committee and the
administration is guilty is their attempt to
show that smoking really wasn't desired in
Burling anyway. The “Carrel poll” that
was considered is both a misleading and
an improper attempt to skirt the issue and
placate the students. Apparently, the com-
mittee felt that only those students who ap-
plied for Carrels should determine library
policy for all of the students, In doing so,
the committee has ommitted valuable in—
put from those upperclassmen who did not
apply for carrels, and completely
disregarded the freshmen altogether.
Even if the poll is taken as representative
of campus opinions, there still exists a
sizeable minority of onerthird of the
students that either did not ojbect to smoke

ing in one fashion or another in the library,
or did not think it a signiiicant enough pror
blem to warrant their response.

Nor, as a smoker, do i find the commit
tee and administration's provisions for
Smoking students to be either equitable or
sufficient, Other students are allowed their
“study aids” of coffee, gum or other foods
and drinks. They are not required to enjoy
them by breaking their studies, isolated
from other students, or to walk through t
cold and ice of an Iowa winter to a pla
where they can enjoy them in comfort. T .
group study rooms where smokers wil
be delegated were not designed to hand]
such a large quantity of smoke as can
expected, nor will they be as comfortabl.
and conductive to study as the carrels are
When smokers are used as a convenien
scapegoat in order to avoid locus of atten
tion upon the more fundamental causes o
danger present to all of us, i belie -
something should be said. And, somethi
should be done, A, David Mathias

“Sly" name Chang

To the Editor:

It has just come to my attention tha
what has traditionally been called “Th
James Gang Bang” will no longer be s
called, but has been renamed “The Jame
Hall Bachanal." I was aware that an effor
was made to change the name of this even
last year by a group of students who claim
ed that the name was offensive and im
plicitly condoned a deviant and crimina
sexual activity known as “gang rape.’
“Gang Bang" was said to entail gang rap-
and the name was thus said to encourag.
or at least add credibility to, violenc
against women.

The attempt was unsuccessful, and i
was decided, after several weeks 0
sometimes heated discussion and debat
that the name ought not be change
Essentially, it was argued on a variety 0
grounds thatalthough “gang bang” can b
taken to connote gang rape, the name .
the event was not in any way meant to su_
gest gang rape, but rather to indicate
boisterous event sponsored by the Jame
Gang. Furthermore, it would be entirel
absurd for anyone to seriously interpr.
the name as a statement of approval i
sexual violence.

I do not know how nor by Whom it wa
decided this year to change the name, bu
my own opinions as to whether or not ’
ought to have been aside, I think that to d
so on the sly after failing to do so overtl
was irresponsible and deceptive and
violation of democratic principles. - Be

“Guests" uninvite-

To the Editor:

Recently there has been much talk abo
the newlyrformed security force for al
campus parties, on the weekend of Oct.
Clark Hall found it necessary to have
security force for its private hall part
They found it necessary for sever.
reasons.

First, many members of the camp
community invited themselves into o .
hall. Which, as a result, alienated man
hall members from their own party,

Secondly, when these uninvite
“guests“ were asked to leave, they bla
tantly refused. This shows a severe lack I
respect for hall members' rights, which
very insulting.

Thirdly, not only was the party ruin
for most hall members, but the dorm al
sustained heavy damage This should m
and was not tolerated.

The following day, the talk was that t
Clark party was a success. Yes, it was
success,but not for whom it was intende
Also, it was not fun for the people who h.
to clean up the enormous mess and w
stayed up to make sure no further dama
occurred.

Does this kind of behavior reflect t
support for individuals rights that peop
on this campus are so quick to defend?
