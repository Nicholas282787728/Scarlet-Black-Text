Without a Cause 11956, 110 min.) This
classic film stars James Dean as Jim. a
tormented youth trying to fit. trapped in a
world without meaning. Natalie Wood and
Sal Mineo, as Judy and Plato, round out.
the excellent cast as youths trying to make
sense out of world they never made Dean
burns with an intensity that expresses the
torment of the nation's youth at that time
Wood provides a perfect complement to
Dean with her light hearted mockery and
inner vulnerability. This film has timeless
element and expresses universal
emotions. There’s a classic unity of time
and space, with the action beginning one
night and ending at dawn the following
day, The film overflows with visual
metaphors. As Jim enters school [or the
iirst time he accidently steps on the ot-
ticial crest. symbolizing the unintentional
nature of his conﬂict with tradition. Dean's
periormance, touching and sensitive,
brought him immortality. When this film
played here two years ago. the typically
drunken Saturday night audience greeted
it with uncalled for and unfortunate
comments and laughter. Possibly now, the
movie will receive the respect and an
preciation it deserves. The film ls dated In
many ways, but its themes and emotions
transcend this constraint and still provide
a poweriul impact Deiinitely see this
movie, but view it to enjoy its great worth
and not to dwell on its unavoidable faults

min). The catchspenny litle obscures the
most subtle film in the science fiction
cycle, with no visual horror whatsoever.
The story deals with a small town in
Southern Calitornia whose population is
taken over by “duplicates" from outer
space.‘ Dr Miles Bennell lKevin MC»

a peculiar change coming over the area.
Miles begins to wonder if some terrible
evil force has overtaken this pleasant little
town. Then Miles and Becky discover
the pods. and the terror carries on. The
more they struggle against it. the more
vast and pervasive the conspiracy seems.
yet for all practical purposes everyone
seems normal. This film, which started out
as a second rate drive-in movie. had Li
phenomenal impact, horrifying people
beyond belief. The film. when Viewed
within its original context, has some Very
interesting political undertones, The film
still holds up well today and should provide
a lively evening oi entertainment.

Cassady lSissv Spacekl The him based
on Carolyn’s memoirs, focuses on the

Spacek, who has overwhelming talent and
an underwhelming part nirector llyran

are anything but sale, and his limidity
betrays him. Still, the film is entertaining
and enjoyable, rounding out 'hc wi'ekend
