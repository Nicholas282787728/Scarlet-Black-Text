Election thoughts : insig

As the campaign season reaches its
climax, it is my objective to put together a
column which combines the issues that
have surfaced this year with personal his
sights gained through involvement with
the Cooper Evans campaign

Voters in the third congressional district
are iortunate to be able to participate in an
election such as this one. One outstanding
aspect is that each candidate represents a
distinct ideological alternative. The
EVans»Cutler race has received a great
deal of national media attention as a
classical ideological battle with a pro-
jected narrow margin of victory. Because
Cutler‘s VleWS have received a great deal
of exposure on campus. this article will not
iocus on both philosophies, but rather only
that oi Evans. _

General sentiment on campus holds
Evans to be a rightrwmg, social service

hopping ogre mm a passion for "rubber
tamping" bills handed down from
”above." Nothing could be further from
the truth. In reality, Evans is a moderate
voice in the legislature who in the past has

voted approximately two-thirds of the time
with the president

Evidence of Evans’ concern for the
social services can be found in his ate
titudes toward student finanCial aid.
Before examining Evans’ position on
financial aid, it is essential that one have a
clear understanding of the legislative pro
cess, Rarely is a congressman given the
opportunity to vote on an isolated issue.
Bills are presented as packages and
although some components may be
Valuable, others may be less so. The result
is an overall bad bill, When Cutler crltciz-
ed Evans for voting down a good proposal
concerning financial aid, a closer look
would reveal that a yes vote may have
been seriously detrimental to another
group.

For conclusions about Evans' position on
aid to education one can examine his
voting record, He has voted to increase the
total education budget by tworbillion
dollars. This constitutes an increase from
the previous level of 4 6 billion dollars. An
interesting aspect oi this issue is that the

is on Evans

number or applications for Guaranteed
Student Loans and Fell-grants is lower
than in previous years, The argument that
loans are more difficult to obtain is weak,
because, although the GSL eligibility stan-
dards have been altered, factors such as
the number of students enrolled in college
from one family and economic concerns
such as home mortgages are given
weighty consideration

Evans has been sensitive to other social
concerns as well, He has developed pro-
posals to revise the social security pro-
gram in order to prevent the dangers
associated with the depletion of social
security resources.

Evans has also outlined ideas for pro-
grams concerning pertinent issues such as
removing the waste from the military
establishment, and encouraging iarmers
to consider and implement long term soil
conservation measures. As a farmer,
Evans has a working knowledge of the
needs of the agricultural sector. With these
qualifications Evans is capable of propose
ing credible alternatives and reforms,

A burned match in fallen snow

now many times have lsat and gazed in-
to the magic of a burning match’s flame,
its heat unnoticed, ever so quickly moving
towards my fingers, only to see it blown
out by the cooling breath or a smiling
woman's irresistable compassion. Listen
to the wind, it is wonderful. All life is
refreshed like this, only it is so hard for us
to understand when we are burning like
cardboard paper in dreams that can never
be realized. Now what is that that burns.
and how shall we approach it? In another
world, in Main Lounge, Isat and stared out
the’ window into what was then today, look
ing for an answer.

Today looked through the glass; its
young women consorting in the remnants
oi a thunderous snowstorm. How long did
they stay there? I do not know, but the
sound of an out of tune piano trumped out
melody into my ears as a musician tapped
the ivory-coated keys and I smelled the

slightly dusty sill as i watched the
women’s laughter without sound through
the pellucid portals of the wall, Suddenly,
without warning, a bored tree threw snow
onto the ground. the snow only to be block~
ed by one of the women‘s coats, A hurried
look up and a smiling good-bye, and
perhaps that would have been the end, but
no. After they had left, another load of
snow, this time alone, save for my unnotic-
ed stare, iell tn the ground, unopposed this
time in its downward tall I looked at the
sundial and thought of how long that tree
had stood there and who had walked under
it, Now was the time to walk under too, and
yet 1 did not. Why I did not I cannot say,
but walk I did not. And the snow melted I
did not know what I had learned, but I
know I had learend something,

Perhaps time is not meant to be
remembered, but I do not think that this is
the answer I was looking for. I did not real»

ly know what I was searching ior, but I
think it was in the second snowfall. Now,
you may ask, what about the second
snowfall? Who cares’,l The snow itself was
unimportant, the ground was ground, the
tree a tree, Big deal So what? Ahhh. It
was here that die question and the answer
both lay so well. For this seemingly unim-
portant happenstance was wonderiul. ln
mose few moments I thought of all the
iriends of my past and all the wonder or
my future. ii such a simple rough»
breathing could inspire wonder, what
could a wind inspire?

In those few brief seconds I attained an
inner calm that I had never before ex»
perienced, 1 was not placid but on the con»
trary excited, Something I had searched
ior ior years had suddenly become ap-
parent, realized. All the boredom I had ex-
perienced had vanished. No longer was I
looking for something to do, my very being

Perhaps the most valuable conclusion
that should be drawn irom this article is
the importance or these issues to the
residents oi the Third District. Few issues
will have a direct impact on students,
however, other issues must be included in
the consideration oi where one should cast
his vote.

Congressional delegates must be respon-
sive to the needs oi their constituents as a
whole and important to that consideration
must be a broad base of knowledge concern
ning all pertinent issues, Cooper Evans
has this broad base oi knowledge. Holding
a masters degree, he is sensitive to the
need ior enhancement oi educational 0p-
portunites. He also utilizes this resource at
a time when technological knowledge is
sorely needed in the us. House of
Representatives

Mortar Board has placed on reserve
literature relevant to these issues. For an
iniormed decision, take a look at the facts
and draw your own conclusions.

was something “to do." These Grinnell
vacations are very odd.

li it had not been ior a blown out match I
would never have written this article. But,
luckily, all is as it should he, and smoke, so
bitter tasting so long ago, is now a burning
light oi guidance in this otherwise murky
world oi unanswered questions,

Soon it shall be the day aiter yesterday's
tomorrow, and another snowflake's
momentary glitter will have slipped into
eternity. Yet this shall not be forgotten,
and the ialling snow of yesterday's storm
shall one day be understood by us all, that
we may laugh like those women did it we
are lucky it will be tomorrow, perhaps, it
we are luckier, it will be today, and a burn-
ing match that would have burned my
lingers can now be held forever, its dark
ash reminding me oi iallen snow on a
Wednesday aiternoon.

 

My break: a scary trip

Don't ask me what I did over break; I’m
going to tell you. But please bear with me,
I think there is an important lesson to be
learned from this story.

During the first weekend of break I
traveled to Madison, Wis, to visit a close
friend from high school and attend my first
Big 10 football game, Madison is the site of
the main campus oi the University of
Wisconsin and is what I commonly call a
party school. “Madtown” (as the people
who attend school mere like to call it) is
obviously a far cry from Grinnell and I
realize that it’s not fair to make coma
parisons between the two institutions of
higher learning, but in this case a com-
parative stance is necessary.

It would be unfair for me not to
acknowledge what I see as a vitally impor
tant component of this story, and that is
that my dear iriend lives in a fraternity, It
really doesn’t matter which one; it is sufiir
cient to say college liie in the “Greek
system” is totally diiicrent irom college
life at a place like Grinnell.

College life, that‘s what I want to tell you
about. Maybe I was expecting good, clean
19505 fun — the kind of stories my dad use
to tell —— or maybe I‘m just naive but, for
whatever reason, I was in no way prepared
for what I encountered

It was a truly beautiful fall day in
Madison and I was looking forward to at
tending me game. Wisconsin was slated to
play Michigan State who was winless so
far this season. As [entered Camp Randall

Stadium I was overwhelmed by its incredi-
ble size. There were 78.187 people at the
game. Fighting through the crowds, my
iriend and i slowly made our way to our
seats in section P — the frat section.

The iirst event that I was to experience
in what would prove to be a long way was
the abuse that section P imposed upon seer
tiun 0. The people in section P hate the
people in section 0 because section 0 was
traditionally the frat Section. Now all the
guys have moved over to section P. but
they still hate section 0, just. because
they’re supposed to. I guess traditions are
hard to break.

The abuse began wth the iirst at many
renditions oi the following song (sung to
the tune of “Found 3 Peanut"): I'm an
assh‘“, I'm an asshm don’t you know,
But I'd rather be an assh**‘ than to sit in
section 0 " Moms and dads might find that
a little rough I admit, but I personally
found |l. kind of funny. What bothered me
was that the song served as a device ior
keeping the crowd paced in their other ac»
tions,

Next I iound myself in the middle or
“Cup Wars." Cup Wars. as I’m sure you
can guess, is the name given to the ”war"
that errupts between the two sections. The
weapons are plastic cups iilled with Coke
I can‘t tell you what fun it is getting drenr
ched with Coke

The iinal aspect oi attending the game
that I found so upsetting was the practice

Richard Lefchinger

,that, ior lack oi a better term, I'll call
“passing a girl." A tricky title I know, but
I think you can catch my drift. What they
do is indiscriminately pass women irom
the bottom rows up to the top of the
stadium yelling “over, over" all the way.
Although each of these lucky women ap-
pear to go along with this nifty act (not
that they have much chime). I saw a great
expresion of fear on the face of each one
that passed near me.

There are about three times as many
cops in sections 0 and P as there are in the
rest of the stadium, They seemed to be
there to prevent a riot more than anyming
else, I saw six ians get ejected irom the
game. Later 1 found out that the cops have
a camera focused on sections 0 and P
throughout the game so that they'll have
pictorial evidence it they decide to pro-
secute somebody, I tell you all of this for
informational purposes,

Now i know that I may have to suiier
some abuse ior my comments [prude,
wimp, etc), but that's all right, I’m tough,

What bothered me the most about the
game was that it turned into a hedonistic
ritual. I’ve been to games beiore where
nobody pays attention to the game, but
never where what was going on in the
stands was more scary than what was hap-
pening down on the iield. In case you
haven't guessed, all oi these actions were
iueled by plenty of beiore and during the
game imbibing oi alcohol.

The point of the story is that its
representative of my whole trip to
Madison. 1 found that college life there
revolved entirely around drinking Now,
we certainly do our fair share here, but at
Madison drinking is their sole form of
entertainment, not only a facilitator or an
adjunct aspect, Getting drunk is what they
do for fun, But their actions aren't fun;
they are damn scary.

I’m sorry gang, but it the majority of our
peers across the country are like that, we
are in (or big trouble.
