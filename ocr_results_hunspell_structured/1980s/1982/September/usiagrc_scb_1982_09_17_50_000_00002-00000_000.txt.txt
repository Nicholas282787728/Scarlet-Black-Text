Furniture arrival ex

by Kim MacDonald

Within four weeks, the current crowding
of Burling Library should be eased by the
arrival of chairs and tables. According to
Head Librarian Christopher McKee, the
chairs will be shipped from Pennsylvania
on September 22. The tables are now under
construction at an Iowa miilworking Coma
pany.

“We’ve been living on promises all sum-
mer , . . some of which came true," McKee
explained, so he cannot predict an exact
date when everything will arrive. “It will
arrive sequentially. . . and the situation
will get steadily better,” he noted.

As far as construction on the first and se—
cond floors is concerned, McKee explained
that they are “pushing hard to get the first
floor done within two weeks. There is no
air conditioning in the building yet, and by
the time it is complete, it will probably no

longer be needed, Blowers are functioning
on the third and fourth floors, and most of
the lighting except on the first floor is com-
plate.

In the recently published guide to library
services, tlte basement was not scheduled
to open until second semester. McKee feels
ﬁlls is a “pessimistic" estimate, but has no
firm idea when certain sections will open.
Because of the plumbing work which will
be done in the basement, there is currently
no plumbing throughout the building.
Thus, the bathrooms on the third and
fourth floors will not be usable until the
basement is complete. ‘

The imposing wooden structure which
recently appeared in the east section of the
main reading room is a “mock-up" carrel
tower. The structure was actually built
some two years ago and was originally in-

follows Curler
to campus

by, Brad Vander Linden

Ly nn Cutler, me Democratic challenger
for Congress from Grinnell and the 3rd
District, will speak in the South Lounge of
the Forum today at 3:30 pm. oitler is be
ing tailed by CBS news as a possible sub—
ject for a feature story dealing Mth l982
congressional campaigns.

Cutler selected Grinnell because of the
broad student support and enthusiasm she
has received on campus. Cutler felt that
Grinnell College was the place to make the
best impression on the national news and
the rest of her district.

The candidate currently serves as a
Black Hawk County supervisor and the
vice chair of the Democratic National
Committee. In 1980, she ran against
Cooper Evans, who was also making a first
bid to serve in Congross, losing by only a
percentage point in a close race. Incum»
bent Evans is in a tight race this year
because the 3rd District has been
redesigned by the 1980 Census to include
liberal Johnson County, home of Iowa City
and the University of Iowa, and Powshiek
County, equally as liberal with Grinnell
and Grinnell College, though much
smaller than Johnson County.

Cutler‘s speech will deal with the roll-
back or environmental standards, the
nuclear freeze/peace movement and cuts
in available student aid to needy college
students.

Amelia Garner: “I didn't like it at first,
but I went there last night and found it
quiet, was really able to study. But it's
very dark — not as many distractions."

Bennett Lasko: ”It's a lot less social and
a little cramped, claustrophobic. Func-
tionally it’s been improved. It looks awful
trom the outside. Maybe there are still not
enough carrels; they’ll probably always
be full."

Brian Gratch: 1 like the inside so far. It‘s
awiully dark, especiauy in the stacks area.

tended to be displayed along with the rest
of the model furniture. However, for
various reasons, it was never exhibited in
the, old Burling. The present structure is
only temporary, and can be altered based
on student reaction. “We put it up to get
some response so the architect can see if
students are comfortable with them,”
McKee explained.

The structure is comprised of two levels
of student seating. 0n the first level,
students will sit at ground level. There is
also a small room inside the tower which
will contain bench seating and tables. The
small round hole is not, as some students
might assume, a place for another in—
novative light in the style of the original
amoeba table lighting. It is simply for ven-

tilation purposes.
Under the present design, in order to et

I can‘t even read without lights. It's a bit
claustrophobic for me and too quiet. Yo
can no longer whip through there in fiv
minutes to see who‘s there. What if there
was a tire? I like the new canals, they're
a good, big size. I would like to see ivy on
the top."

Sally Key: “1 think it is interesting how
the administration is trying to cover up
how ugly it is. In the artist's rendering
there are trees where, in reality, mm are
no trees."

Tom McCarthy: “I kind of like it, but I
want to know what's in between the second
and third floors. I think there‘s a secret
floor there where they've hidden the Zirkle
monument."

Barb Little: ”I like it; it‘s very con-
ducive to study. I’m getting a lot done,”

Mary Kosmidis: ”I think it's looking
good. The downstairs looks so much larger
and the carrels are more separated so
there’s less distraction. The doors are too
noisy but the carpeting makes it a lot
quieter and it looks nice.”

Nathaniel Heidenheimer: ”On the third
and fourth floors it feels like you‘re on
another planet.”

Rich Beck: “I saw it as a prospective
and I go there for studying. Living on my
lloor, I need a place to go to study. People
say its ugly, but I think that it is just pres
judice. It looks okay at night.

updates health

care information booklet

by Carol Lickenbrock
The Women's Health Care Resource

booklet has not been updated for three
years and only limited copies are
available. Information about women's
health facilities and services offered in the
Grinnell area is not readily available, so a
committee of the Women’s Group has
organized to eliminate this information
gap.

The committee includes Sue SdlneckV
Rachel Vaughan, Mary Morley, Valerie
Chapman and Bernadette Connors. They
hope to “create a resource for women at
Grinnell," according to Schneck, the com-
mittee’s head. She continued, “We want to
let people know it's okay to ask questions
and provide people for them to ask."

Plans to achieve this goal consist of two
parts. The first involves a revised and ex-
panded edition of the Women's Health
Care Resource booklet. This new edition
will includ 'nforrnation on the women's
health tac as in the area surrounding
Grinnell which meet the standards of
quality established by the committee
members and Andrea Griswold, adr
ministrative supervisor of the Health
Center. It will also include a bibliography
listing books with information on speciﬁc
areas of women’s health care.

The booklet will detail the cost of treatr
merit, hours, availability of appointments,
along with the types of services provided,
birth control methodsrecommended and
the staff composition of each care center.
Copis will be distributed to all Grinnell

women so “It will be there for any student
who needs it," Vaughan stated.

The second part involves an information
bank with two sections. Boﬂl will utilize
the Health Center as a ”support, resource,
and liason to a larger health care system,”
Griswold explained. The first section in-
cludes, ”women that women can Contact
when they have questions,” Schneck ex-
plained. Women who are willing to share
their experiences at certain clinics and
with certain treatments will be put on a list
which will be available only through the

to the second level of Carrels, a student
must climb up a series of junglegym type
rungs. McKee, however, “favors a stair."
but he noted that it is possible to get up
without spilling a cup of coffee.

Once up there, students will sit on pads
with their feet hanging down into open
space. In other words, there are no chairs
on the second level. “It's like a Japanese
restaurant,” McKee explained. Studens
sit at desks facing outside on the second
level, whereas they face into the wall of the
tower on the lower level.

If students like the towers, one each will
be placed in the two sections of the main
reading room. Surrounding the towers will
be couches, a few tables and lounge chairs.
The towers each seat 16 people with an
undefined number in the small inner room.

64% favor
smoking ban

by Jane Kaufman

The smoking ban survey given with ap
plications for study Carrels at Burling
Library have been totalled: of 465
responses, 64 percent of the students said
they would “favor a total ban on smoking
in Burling Library," while 36 percent op»
posed a total smoking ban. At this time,
smoking is permitted on the first floor on-
ly.
“The is hardly a mandate for banning
smoking throughout the entire building,”
explained Christopher McKee. librarian
of the college. However, McKee also
remarked, “There will be no smoking in
the basement because of the rare book and
art collection. In addtion, according to

‘McKee, “There are compelling reasons

because a! tire hazards, for not allowing
smoking on the third and fourth floors."
McKee mentioned that he.a'nd.Anne'kint—
ner. associate librarian and'vcollege ar-
chivist, will be making are final decision or
where smoking will be allowed. ”We are
considering the amphitheater seating" as

. a possible place to allow smoking, he com-

mented. Their final decision should be
made within the next three weeks. The
solution implemented will be in effect for
only one semester. McKee noted, “You
have to refine those things as you go.“

McKee emphasized the fact that allow
ing any smoking in the library may be ex7
tremely dangerous because of fire
hazards. He also asserted that many of the
resources housed in the library are
priceless. “The safest thing we could do,"
he said, “is to not. allow smoking.”
However, he also said that a total ban on
smoking would be very unlikely.

Health Center nurses to women seeking
one-to-one confidential information and

_ shared experience.

The committee will also compile a file of
information from women who wish to re-
main anonymous. This file will be
available to everyone at the Office of Stu-
dent Affairs and die Health Center.

Schneck emphasized that what ﬁle com-
mittee can accomplish depends largely on
the response of women on campus. She ex—
plained that “What no one is telling us, we
have to tell each other.”

Cyclone future looks dim

by Martin Merlotto

Because no one has expressed an inc
terest in taking the position, the Grinnell
yearbook, known as the Cyclone, currently
has no editor.

The lack of an editor worries the
members of the Student Publicatlon and
Radio Committee (SP&R) and raises
serious doubts about whether or not a
yearbook will he published this year.

Richard Letchinger, chairperson of
SP&R, uplained that this problem may
force SPftR to produce alternatives to the
Cyclone, like “yearbook kits" and year-
bools which consist of pictures and no
copy. hetchingel' views such a possibility

from now,” said Letchinger.

betchinger believes that being an editor
would be a worthwhile experience for
anyone. “Besides giving a person a
responsible position," said Lettchinger, “it
would look good on anyone's resume."

When asked whether- or not any apathy
toward the editor’s position might have its
roots in the past reputation of the year—
book, betchinger said that the yearbook‘s
reputation has little to do with the pracnt
situation. He added that “A yearbook
reﬂects the editor . . . he or she will deter-
mine the quality of the yearbook.” Let-
chinger also predicted that last year’s
