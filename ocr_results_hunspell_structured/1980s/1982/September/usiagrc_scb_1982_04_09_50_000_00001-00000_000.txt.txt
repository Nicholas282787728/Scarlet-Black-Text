Kingman Brewster was the president of
Yale University for 13 years and United
States Ambassador to the Court of St.
James {or iour years under the Carter Ad
ministration He was at Grinnell this week

to give two Rosenﬁeld lectures and the .

5&8 took the opportunity to speak with
Brewster about some topics currently in
the news.

Brewster told us his views on several
issues including the Falkland Islands
dispute. European reeling on nuclear
escalation, divestment and supplyssidc
economics.

The situation in the Falkland Islands,
where Argentina is threatening to take
control or the Britishsgoverned islands.
distresses Brewster. He said, “It would be
a disaster ior everybody if itcame to blows

at the same time i think it would be a
aster to let the Argentines believe that
this kind at aggressive solution to an an
cient problem is acceptable." According to
Brewster, it would be “a very bad prece-
dent" to permit borders or countries to be
revised “by the use of naked lorce." He
said it was in everyone's interest to
negotiate a compromise

On the question oi nuclear arms,-

Brewster said that concern in Europe has
grown with the arms escalation. The anti-
nuclear movement there has grown. he ex-
plained, “fueled by some oi the reckless
remarks by the president. “I don't hink
it's fundamentally antisAmerican
continued, “it’s just antinuclear "
Brewster himself thinks it is “foolish,
naive. wishful thinking" that a unilateral
disarmament would set an example which
the Soviets would iollow. “The only way
we will get nuclear arms control is to be
sure that both superpowers realize that
they're not likely to have an overwhelming
advantage," Brewster stated He explain
ed that although it is expensive to have an
escalating stalemate, which accomplishes
naming, he thinks unilateral disarmament
invites a greater risk oi nuclear war than
maintaining some kind Di deterrant

If he were not 62 years old,
Brewster said, “my bumper
sticker would say ’I’d rather

befdrafted than nuked."’

Brewster proposed an alternative to the
Selective Service System now being
employed inthis country, He advocates
"universal, undercompensated, publicly
usciul service " His idea would mean a
manditory term ior everyone in some iorm
oi publically useiul service, not necessarlr
ly working tor the government The
military would he one option tor a public
service, The military could "sweeten the
deal." Brewster said. with educational and
other fringe beneiits. especially tor rcs
enlistment.

it he were not oz years old. Brewster
said, "my bumper sticker would say ‘l‘d
rather be drarted than nuked ' "He said it
seems to him that “the only way to avoid
nuclear war is have a strong enough cons
ventional capacity so that neither you nor
your adversary would be tempted to use
nuclear weapons and overcome the gross
interiority oi conventional weapons."

Some iorm oi lionsvoluntary military is
necessary. Brewster believes. because
keeping enough conventional rorces for a
legitimate delense would take more of an
army than the'Unlted States can afford or
than the nation can recruit on a voluntary
basis. "The real argument against the all
volunteer army,“ Brewster said, “is that
it's inequitable . . most volunteers are
people who escape to the army because the
is so miserable in the ghetto . . It's only
voluntary in form rather than fact,”

When asked him opinion' on the
Margaret Thatcher government's supply»
side economics, Brewster replied. "The
pure supply-side approach to the control oi
inilation seems to me nuts." He said
supplysside “may have a part to play" but
cannot help the problem alone. _

Yet Brewster does not think Thatcher's
problems are all her own iault. He said
that the whole world is in a recession and
Britain is so dependent on ioreign markee
that nothing is going to work. He does
think. however. that public expenditure
had to be brought down and he only ques-
tioned the methods.

“No western country. said Brewster,
“ourself included, has found a way oi imr
posing the burdens of cutbacks on anybody
but those on the bottom at the heap . . . I
think it would be more equitable ii we had
a graduated comsumption tax so the more
you spend. the more you get taxed."

The Beagans have otten been criticized

for their lavish spending Brewster called
it "had Judgment" but he does think their
extravagance is malicious or callous. "I do
admire the desire to conduct an office like
the presidency with some style." Brewster
remarked, “I don‘t think he can avoid the
representation l‘unctioii which is inherent
in the presidency and the White House but
you can aIso overdo it,"

Brewster is concerned that this ads
ministration does not place onough impors
tance on being "clean as a bound: tooth,"
as he put it. There is too much possibility
ior conilict in private and public interest in
matters such as private contributions to
Reagan appointees. Brewster does not
think such contributions are necessarily
meant ior personal gain but they could be
contrused so .

Questioned on the eiiecliveness oi
divestment of funds from South African
companies which support apartheid.
Brewster said. ”I'm not one who believes
that all divestment in South Africa is a
good thing I do think the behavior or
American companies is something to
worry about and I do think the support or
the South Airican government by loans or
other tinancial participation is unacceps
table as long as apartheid remains.”

Withdrawing iunds rrom all companies
in South Africa is a bad idea. Brewster
believes. because some companies do have
(alr opportunity policies and non-
discriminating wages Taking investments
irom these companies would probably do
a lotoi harm to the people you most want
to help," he explained

He suggested people write to the com-
panies in which they have invested to tell
them oi any policics they disagree with
Brewster said companies are "terribly
public relations conscious and their boards
spend a great deal or time responding to
these things "

The apartheid problem is also controver—
sial in England. Brewster asserted that the
English-speaking part oi South Airica is
more progressive than the Dutchsspeaking
part. however. He said. “The Africans are
utterly unreconstructive racial
supremacists." He Said that the most pros
gress in journalism and law have comc
lrom the Englishsspeaking part,

While president of Yale. Brewster talked
with blacks who had been to South Afrlca
and they were not in iavor of divestment.
“And a guy like Andy Young, ior instance.

Hewster on international relations

or Vernon Jordan. former head of thc Urr
ban League. was not in tavor or across the
board divestment." he added.

Brewster also discussed controversws
which arose at Yale While he was president
oi that unirersity, These topi -
civil rights. minority admission to _the
school. minority representation in curs
riculum. admission of women to Yale Col
lege and student power, Concerning how
much power students should hold in their
universtty, Brewster thinks that "pars
ticipatory democracy" is unacceptable.
Hc tools that types oi system politicizes
otherwise nonspolitical matters. Students
should have a large degree Dfpartlcipation
in student his and disciplinary decisions
but not in such areas as curriculum or
Board Ol Trustee decisions.

Brewster said Students and faculty
should not be a Board of Trustees. “The
very strength oi trusteeship . , is that you
don't. as a trustee, reel you have any can
stitucncy . . .your own best judgment is in
the interest of the ins|ituli0n as a whole ‘

At the curriculum debate on Tuesda).
Feb. 23. Rosenlicld Professor Joseph Wall
Commented that if one wanled to know
what Grinnell's curriculum would be like
he should look at what Yale has done in the
past two or three years. Brewster said he
thinks that "the bigger. older universities
which produce more than their share of thc
raculty members that go on to other col-
leges and universities do have a leadership
function." He said there is no doubt that
people pay attention to Yale and
Harvard‘s struggles about what malies a
good undergraduate education. In
Brewster‘s opinion, the people making
those deciswns tend to be bright and in-
telligent, and it Is worthwhile to listen (0
them

Yale recently instituted a minimal
language proiiciency requirement which
Brewster thinks will have an effect on
other schools.

Another reason Brewster gave ior why
universities such as Yale and Harvard are
{allowed is that they are almost the only in
stitutions where the president is also lhc
chairman oi the board. He says this com-
bination makes the presidency “a much
stronger office." The president sets the
board agenda and in presiding over the
board is likely to have a more constructive
relationship between the trustees and the
administration.
