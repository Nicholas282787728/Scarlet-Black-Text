Grinnell iudged in
Playboy sex survey

The fame of Grinnell College is spreading and this time we've made
it into the October issue of the magazine well known for its “good are
ticles" 7 Playboy. It appears the magazinehas conducted a survey of
sex on campus at some 20 schools and Grinnell was among them. Our
rating on a scale of one to 20 was a lowly 17.

A feature of the article is a fold~out containing what Play bo3. con»
siders characteristics of each school According to Playboy
Grinnell s U. ical male and female a1 e a tlansplar ed hew V0
and a hipless historyrraior. ‘ Our rile style is co.nl" eld liberti sm"
and our ' hottest hangout is the Pub, The magazine 5 v we release
steam by attending histo sympo ums, our in" uncontrolled
substance is “cogitation and our mascot is Herodot ‘l‘OZ‘iC "’

What they call Grinnell .5 xual tenlperatur ' is 58 degree ap-
parently “too much thinking, not enough drinking. Didn’t the go to

on a weekend night? Playboy thinks the Grinnell administi'ar
n 1s ‘still pretty progressive" and our best academic department is
history. Under its “Sex Central‘ column, the compiler of the chart
recommends checking “the notches on the doors in the men’s
dorms.” (plural?) Apparently the best come-on is to be a “visiting
professor of Egyptology" and initiate conversation (or whatever)
with the line, “I’m certain we were lovers in a past life." When was
the last time you heard that one'r7

Just how accurate could a survey such as this one be, anyway? How
“honored” do Grinnellians feel at being part of the study? The
research seems to have been kept very quiet; how many of us were in-
terviewed or received questionnaires? Did you receive one, and what
did you think’ about it‘.7

Now that you know the results of this survey, how Grinnell is being
explained to Playboy readership, what do you think about it? The
Scarlet and Black is interested to hear how Grinnellians view this
characterization.

There is little in Grinnell to induce one to
stay here over the summer: take away the
few comiorts and diversions provided by
the campus community, the remains are
meager, However, when the choice is bet-
ween: 1) returning home to a state mm the
third highest unemployment rate in the na~
tion, and in general, a dreadful prospect
considering the provincialism or my home
town, or 2) guaranteed employment and
relatively low cost oi living, one quickly
swallows his pride and befriends every ac-
quaintance with an automotive vehicle.

Not only does Grinnell College generous-
ly underwrite my education but this Sums
mer they even decided to employ me. (The
irony of receiving a paycheck irom the col-
lege and knowing that in a matter of weeks
that money would return to their cuiicrs
was a bit distressing ) Most summer jobs
are dull repetitious tedious and not very
engaging; vacuuming books at Burling
Library was no exception The original
plan was to hire iivc students to move and
vacuum 250,000 hooks, 2,000 periodical
series (series containing anywhere from
100 to 200 bound volumes), the relerence
collection, the record collection (moved
