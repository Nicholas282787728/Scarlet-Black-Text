Firey debate on alarms in SGA

by Nancy L. Radermecher

Discussion of the Committee on Student
Life's (CSL) proposed fire alarm policy
highlighted Wednesday’s SGA meeting.
The policy, originally set forth by last
year's CSL, provides for a minimum line
of $50 [or students who discharge a fire ex-
tinguisher or set off an alarm unnecessari-
ly in any college-owned buildings. if the of-
fender is not Identified, the fine is to be
paid for by hall funds, or in the case of in
sufficient funds, by the hall residens
themselves. The proposal further states
that serious offenses will result in stricter
penalties, “up to, and including,
expulsion."

Presenting the CSL policy, Read Hall
President Vic Rudolph emphasized the imr
portance of its discussion by saying “We
have the perfect right to say no. . , it (the
proposal) was not brought to us to be
rubber-stamped, it was brought to be
discussed,"

The ensuing debate centered on two
issues: the severity of the minimum fine,
and the Case of students who inadvertantly
set off the alarms while smoking or using
popcorn poppers. Rﬁponding to the latter,
Rudolph explained that unjust fines can be
appealed to the assistant dean of Student
Affairs and the student coordinator,
However, the minimum 850 fine (represem
ting a 340 increase over the existing

policy) proved to be the focal point of the -

discussion.

A movement was made to amend the
proposal by eliminating a minimum penal
ty, Arguing that tampering with the alarm
System constitutes a serious offense which
warrants a significant penalty, Loose Hall
COVPresident Katherine Altemus stated,

“It (the system) is a needed part of the
dorm, , personally, I don't want Grinnell
recognized nationally for a fire or ouier
tragedy."

The motion was defeated, but discussion
of the proposal in general continued for a
short while longer. Finally, the Joint
Board accepted the CSL policy as
presented. The proposal will finally be sent
to President Drake for approval.

in other business, the Finance Commit
tee chairperson, Vern Juel, presented two
funding requests, The first was for a $500
allocation to the Student Coordinator's of
rice to replenish the depleted student loan
fund Arguing in favor of the proposal, Stu-
dent Coordinator, John Scharff pointed out
that the loan program, “has quickly
become the best service we offer.” The re-
quest was unanimously approved.
Likewise, the second request, a $225
allocation for the SGA Square Dance this
Friday was approved unanimously.

Completing his presentation, .luel in—
formed .lB members that the balance of
the reserve fund is $12,000 which is $6,000
higher than in the past four years. Main-
taining that $5,000 was a sufficient sum for
die fund, .luel asked members to consider
ways to allocate the excess money. Sug-
gestions already brought up in the Pinance
Committee include: 1) a capital improve—
merit fund providing for such expenditures
as improving the ARH sound system and
expanding the 1(ch library, 2) sponsoring
one large allcampus event such as a cons
cert or skip-day revival, at enriching ex-
isting events, 4) increasing hall funds or
the general fund and 5) increasing the ens
dowment via a directdeposit.

In his report, VicesPresident Mark Brads
Shaw detailed the security committee's
plan to choose 15 people to act as security
guards at campus events. Emphasizing
the importance of good attitude, Bradshaw
encouraged hall presidents to inform hall
members of the available positions.

The student coordinator reported that
fallsbreak shuttle tickets would be less exs
pensive this year with roundrtrip tickets to
Des Moines costing 342 and roundrtrip
tickes to Chicago costing $40, Scharﬂ' adds
ed that shuttles to Kansas City and/or Mina
neapnlis would be considered if studens
express sufficient interest

in committee repors, Richard Lets
chtnger, SPMI chairperson, announced
that several students responded to the plea
for a yearbook editor. Consequently, there
will be a yearbook this year. Letchinger
added that extra copies of this year’s
Cyclone will be available at a cost of $15.

Practical ioke

impractical for
food service
budget

by Barbara Little

sometime between dinner on Thursday,
Sept. 16, and breakfast on Friday, Sept, 17,
approximately 600 place settings of silver»
ware vanlshed from Cowles dining hall
With no other alternative, kitchen workers
provided plastic utensils for Cowles diners
during breakfast, lunch and most of dinner
on Friday, During dinner, Cowles kitchen
received a phone call from a caller who in
troduced himself as George Drake. l-le
hinted that die missing silverware was
behind Darby Gymnasium. The utensils
were gathered, sanitized and returned to
use in the dining hall but an inventory
showed about I20 sets were still missing.

Dave McConnell, director of food ser-
vice, said that this incident was “a prac-
tical joke that wasn't at all practical."
Substitution of the plasticware cost food
service close to $150 at 12 cents per place
setting. lt also caused inconvenience for
the entire student body.

McConnell pointed out that had plastic»
ware not been available, the prank could
have been even more inconvenient for all.
It would have meant rearranging the
whole menu to feature finger foods such as
“peanut butter and jelly,” McConnell said,
He was also quick to poml out that it is dif»
ficult to offer salad bar with no utensils
unless one is especially fond of carrot and
celery sticks.

With about $400 worth of silverware still
missing, McConnell is not content to wait
for another anonymous tip as to its
whereabouts. i-le theorized that whoever
pulled the gag will find it necessary to
spread the word of his accomplishment.
Evenutally. McConnell thinks, the clue
will reach food service, Until then, McCon-
nell explained he will resort to “plain old
detective work," The perpetrators should
pay for this, McConnell claimed. because
Grinnell does not have $400 to throw away.

The money spent on the plasticware is
equivalent to the amount which could be
spent to buy frozen yogurt for two special
dinners or cheese [or the salad bar for four
meals. The entire student body, McConnell
emphasized, should not suffer because of a
practical joker,

Cu’rler campaigns in South Lounge

by Jeff Raymond

The expected presence of a CBS News
crew was to have highlighted the ap-
pearance last week of Lynn Cutler,
Democratic candidate [or Iowa’s 3rd
District US. Congressional seat, The news
crew, however, covered Cutler on the
previous day and was with her challenger,
Cooper Evans, at Luther College during
Culler‘s appearance here Friday.

Cutler, who has addressed audiences at
Grinnell before, began her talk by giving a
quick description of this district and the
problems indigenous to it as well as me
problems it shares with districts all over
the country. She spoke of this country's
economic difficulties as well as the pro
blems of farmers,

Specifically, Cutler addressed
unemployment, iunds for education and
the tendancy of the Reagan Administrar
tion to support big business and the
military.

She then gave a history of her previous
campaign in 1980 as well as her present at
to "Cutler ' 'husband died two, weeks
before the‘clec'ti’on'in 1980 andshe fell short

in her election bid by approximately 6,000
votes,

“It was interesting because that meant
that 41,000 people voted for Chuck
Grassley and for me,” quipped Cutler.
Charles Grassley is a Republican senator
from Iowa noted for his conservative
politics. “It shows, though, how Iowans
vote. They’re very independent thinkers.
That's good and that’s the way it ought to
be," she Said.

Cutler lamented the low voter tumouB
here and nationwide, and noted how so few
people put the present administration into
office '

The candidate explained that although
she originally did not want to run for office
after the 1980 election effort, the sudden
change in priorities that the new powers in
Washington brought about forced her into
a position in which she felt pressured into
running again for Congress,

“It became so clear to me last fall that
they had so tomlly tumcd upsiderdown our
national priorities,” Cutler explained She
continued critically, “They didn'l cut

spending; they just took it from the
domestic side and put it into the weapons
side,"

After closing her speech, which lasted
about 25 minutes, Cutler took questions
from the audience of approximately 100
people. Students asked the candidate
about her position on farm revitalization,
energy and economic policies and
Reagan’s cabinet,

in response to a question about where
most of her differences with Evans layi
Cutler stated that she and her opponent
disagree on “almost everything."

Cutler felt that her present campaign
differed from her 1980 effort in that she
now has better organization, more
outreach to voters and more money.
Evans, meanwhile, was taking a “lower
road” in his present campaign, according
to Cutler.

State Representative Janet Carl, who is
seeking reelection this fall, took the
podium after 'Cutler and spoke for a few
minutes before the end ofthe program, -
