Soccer

by John Hanson

Alter racing the loss oi iive solid
starters. among them the Midwest Cons
ference’s allrtime leading scorer, most
soccer coaches would fall back on the old
adage and proclaim a building year. Not so
with Coach John Pfitsch and the Grinnell
Pioneers.

Quite blunﬂy, Coach Pfitsch believes his
troops have the ability to take the Southern
Division title and reach the League Cham-
pionship, where they have been stopped
the last two years 2-0 and 1'0 by Lake
Forest. “This team may be just as good as
last year’s," stated Pfitsch, “We definitely
have better than average talent.”

Led by captains John Gerry, Dave
Furth, and Jim Indiveri, the Pioneers will
be looking to install a movement offense
backed by a solid line of defense,

Using perhaps their biggest asset, team
speed, the Pioneer offense should resem-
ble a running basketball team, in that
Grinnell's offense is designed to run a
“fast break.” Hopefully a long and busy
schedule oi 14 games will give the players
enough time to adopt this new style, in a
game of continual movement it is easy to
revert back to old habits,

Much oi such hope rests upon Grinnell's
solid and experienced defense Anchoring
the team are returning .alleconference
tullbacks Furth and Henrerork Steiner,
in Pfitsch’s words, “the two best fullbacks
in the Midwest Conference ”

Field Hockey

by Ten Porter

With‘a’n‘e'w coach who says she has “an
enthusiastic group of players,” the field
hockey team looks iorward to a good start
this year. The “enthusiastic group” is
composed of nine seniors, one junior,
seven sophomores and six freshmen tor a
total of 23 women,

Cathy Schweitzer, who took over at the
end of last year aiter Merry 0rmsby
resigned, has had previous coaching ex»
perience at the University of Oklahoma at
Norman, “I’m looking forward to the
season this year," said Schweitzer.

Besides good ball handling, Schweitzer
cited defense and Communication as me
team’s strong points. The one weakness,
according to the coach, is the overall
stickhandling skills, She added, “We still
need improvement.”

“Hopefully, we'll just improve talent
wise throughout the season,” the coach
said. The team does have one goal already
set: to get an invitation to the NCAA
regional toui-namen

“It’s not necessarily whether we pro-
duce a winning season," cemented the
coach on her personal philosophy, “It's
that we get better.” She went on to say, “I
believe in going out to give your best and
still being able to enjoy the game.”
Schweitzer defined the ultimate season as
one in which, “The players enjoy the
season and improve their skills at the
Same time.”

Football

,by Eric Weiss

As the Grinnell football team ap
proaches its opening game against
Graceland this Saturday, Coach Ed Dom»
browski has discovered a major problem
with his team: lack of depth. Because of

cuts in financial aid, participation in
foreign programs, students transiering to
other schools and simply because some
students have decided not to go out this
year Dombrowski finds himself with a
iootball team oi only 35 players, as oppos-
ed to the so he had last year,

Despite this disadvanwge, Dombrowski
stresses the strength and experience of
this year's squad, which is lead by cape
tains Mike McCrary and Jesse Mueller,
both standoutson last years 2—6 squad.

As can be expected, Dombrowsk‘ is_
optimistic, “Of course I'm optimis 'c,
when you don't know what is ahead of you,
you have to be optimistic,”

“We’re not going to hang our heads and
say, ‘Well, since we don't have 58 players
anymore, we’re no good.’ Every player we
have out there is a very solid ballplayer
And, as opposed to last year, every player
out there wants to play; he’wants to be out
there."

When speaking of this week‘s opener,
against Graceland as well as future perfor-
mances, Dombrowski was realistic. “It's
really uniair at this point to say anything. I
don't want to become a person who makes
predictions. were just going to take each
game as it comes and we’re going to go out
there and do our best,”

Women's Cross Country

by Margurite Tozer

Evelyn Freeman, women‘s cross
country coach for the last three years,
speaks positively about this year’s team,
Already, at least 21 women have contacted
Freeman, 15 of which are new students.
Many of the women joined in response to a
recruitment letter Freeman sent to them
over the summer.

Among those women welcomed back are
top runners Andrea Straight and Barbara
Elias. Elias is returning after a year out
due to injuries. Perhaps, through the com-
bined efforts of both new and old
members, the team will be looking
unusually strong.

The women prepare ior competition
through a fairly rigorous training pro-
gram The team meets and runs Monday
through Friday, trom 4 to a in the after-
noon, For two of those days, the women lift
weights heiore their daily run,

The women’s personal reasons ior join»
ing the team are Varied. Freeman stated
that competition, physical fitness,
discipline and a break from studies are
reasons students frequently give ior Joins
ing The common emphasis is on develop
ing individual talents, as the training
schedule indicates.

Men's Cross Country

by Scott Sutherland

With 30 runners including to ireshmen
out tor the team, two key words in describ-
ing die 1982 men's crosscountry team
would have to be “youth" and “depth."

“1 think this is the most depth I‘ve ever
seen on a Grinnell men’s cross-country
team,” said Coach Ray Obermiller.
Following the loss of standout David
Cooke to graduation, Obermiller is hoping
that his seven returning lettermen and the
team’s sheer numbers can pick up the
slack.

“We‘ve got 10 to 15 runners who'll be
competing for the top spots on the team,"

OFFICIALS NEEDED

said Obermiller. “That kind of competition
within the squad makes for a strong
team.” “Strength" was the key last
year as the team ran up a 570 dual meet

country racers to novice runners. Training

tour miles daily and other upwards oi 12 on
