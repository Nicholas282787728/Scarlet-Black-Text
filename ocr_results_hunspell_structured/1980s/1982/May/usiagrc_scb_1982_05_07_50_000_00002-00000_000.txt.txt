Jomt Board asks Frazer to resign one of her positions
SGA votes on letter to Frazer and divestment

by Melissa Kagle

in the last meeting of the current Joint
Board and Cabinet Wednesday night,
S.G.A. unanimously approved a proposal
to send a letter to Dean Catherine Frazer
asking for her resignation in either one 0i
her two positons at the college.

Frazer’s role in the denial of tenure to
Assistant Professor oi Philosophy Dan
Magurshak is a subject oi dispute around
campus. in the lengthy Joint Board
meeting, David Cooke, the off-Campus
representative, read a letter he drafted

which asks for the resignation of Dean
Frazer either irom her position as dean of

iaculty or as tenured professor at
philosophy, In his letter, Cooke cited the
Conflictof interest inherent in holding both
posts, and Frazer's recent "exploitation"
~' her “unusual position." He noted the
possibility oi iuture misuses of

power as reasons for the request that she
resign irom one of the positions

Cowles Hall Representative harley Liker
pointed out that Frazer retused to resign at
a special, closed session of SGA held
Tuesday night and that the letter is not
likely to have any eiiect on her decision,
Student Publications and Radio Chair
David Molho reminded the represenr
tatives that as students they do not have all
the iacts in the case.

Auditor Leighton Nakata made an
analogy between nus case and that oi
Richard Nixon, who was asked to resign by
the American people although a large ma-
jority oi them did not have all the facts in
the case. Nixon also reiused to resign at
iirst.

The hoard voted unanimously to present
the letter not only to Frazer, but also to the

trustees. After the Vote, Molho warned
them that if the trustees found the letter to
be iactually incorrect. it would cause pro
blems with letters sent to the trustees in
the future.

In other busmess, the South African Sup-
port Group proposed the divestment of the
college's and SGA's funds from South
African Corporations. During a lively
discussion of this proposal, Molho voiced
the most opposition, arguing that the only
way that the U.S. can maintain their
beneficial inﬂuences is by continuing to in-
vest in that country.

He claimed that although the U.S. cor-
porations are not perfect, they do provide
some of the best working conditions and
highest wages in South Airica. Molho con-
cluded by saying that Grinnell and other
colleges should start a movement to

pressure us, corporations to continue to
improve rather than lose our influence by
withdrawing the SGA funds,

Chris Lehman and Joel Robbins refuted
Molho’s arguments by saying that U.S.
businesses cannot have any affect on the
South African government because they
are required by law to stay within the rules
of the apartheid government. Thereiore,
the two stated that the only way the U.S.
can influence is through divestment.

Joint Board President Rowe was forced
to cast a deciding vote aiter the proposal
resulted in a tie vote among the hall
representatives He voted in favor of
divestment.

The 1582-33 budget passed with only one
ammendment, the addition of a $200 salary
{or the business manager oi the Student »
Publications anleadio Committee. The
budget will be voted on again next fall.

Library finds atemporary home in North Lounge
McKee says rumors “are a distortion of things which are true”

by Kim MacDonald

liuinors about the possible closure of
Burling Library have circulated for mon-
ths. A small announcement in this week's
Ml‘n I changed this rumor into fact

On the day after Commencement, the
reference department, including the card
catalogue, the circulation desk, the in-
terlibrary loan system and the secretary
to the Librarian of the College Christopher
McKee. will take up residence in North
Lounge,

According to McKee, Burllng will be
closed to the general public only until New
Studenls Days this fall. Some staff, in-
cluding McKee himsell, will remain in the
building, in part to supervise the collection
and because oi the complexity of moving

certain equipment. The cataloguing and
acquisitions departments in the basement
will remain, as will the library computer
system, since it is difficult to move the
computers,

McKee said he will stay in order to keep
a “presence oi library personnel in the
building,” and to oversee the day in day
progress. The remaining staff will keep an
eye on the books to guard against water
damage and excesswe humidity. At times.
there will be very few windows in the
library and there is currently no air condi-
tioning. ’

The collection will be available to the
general public by means of runners Who‘.
will fetch requested books from the
library

The decision to move arose from a
“cluster of reasons," according to McKee,
He explained that the primary reason is
“the need to 'vacate ﬂoors as much as
possible" to allow for construction and the
installation oi carpeting. Furthermore,
North Lounge has the advantage oi air
conditioning, which, because of duct work,
is no longer operating in the library,

As far as rumors circulating about Burlr
ing operating irom North Lounge as late as
next Thanksgivmg, McKee claims these
rumors are, “a distortion of things which
are true. . . we won't finish in the basement
‘til Christmas." But he expects ﬁle library
to be “near normal by New Student Days."
“We wouldn't like to move anymore than
anyone else," said McKee, and added.

China’s political state reflected in art and poetry

Making Chinese History ,accessible to
the Western reader has been one oi
historian Jonathon Spencc's main cone
cerns in his writings on China. Spence, the
George Burton Adams professor of history
at Yale University, delivered the iinal
Scholar's convocation last week speaking
on centemporary China. in an interview
with the 8&8. Spence talked about
goals for his books and gave some observa-
tions on modern China.

in his last three books, Tlic Emporei‘ oi
china, The nenth oi Woman Wang, and
The Gate or llcaveiily Peace, Spence has
been looking tor the middle ground bet-
ween the complex analysis oi monographs
which are usually reserved ior serious

scholars of China, and literature that has _

aimed ior popularity with broad
generalizations about China, yet without
any historical rctercnccs, instead. he said
he has tried to "develop an aesthetic struc
turn around an accurate historical center
which could be archivaliy based. And then
you can draw the western reader into a
level of intimatc Contact with the Chinese
reality, rather than having it all utterly
distant and broad or so distant they
couldn't grasp it at all."

Spence admitted that his background in
Western Humanities may be partly

responsible for his preference for aesthetic

sources, such as poetry, novels and art,

rather than political sourcﬁ. He sees in

these sources a reflection of political and‘
cultural currents. Reviewing the contem-

porary cultural scene in china, Spence

pointed out some of these trends

Poetry recently has been sharply
critical of the state, In its bold Criticism
Spence sees a parallel to the anti-
Guomindag poetry oi the 15405. Film is
another area that has become a forum for
criticism, although within certain bounds.
Safe topics for Criticism have been the
gang oi tour, the cultural revolution, and
Japanese imperialism during Chiang
Kai Shek's reign. However, Spence pointed
out that shrewd directors have been able to
imply that their criticism oi events in
Chinese history have parallels in modern
China, 0r, like Bai Hau, whose film he
discussed in his convocation lecture, a
iilminakcr may selectively present his
history oi the revolutionary period,

One of his recent interests has been in
Chinese photography As a reviewer oi an
exhibiton oi the Chinese photography
which will open this week in Washington
DC. at the National Academy of Sciences,
he was able to discern some interesting
developments. The show was almost en-
tirely landscapes yet he was struck by
the diiierence in these idyllic landscapes
and What would have been shown when
Mac was alive. He pointed out that under
Mao such landscapes would have shown a
peasant working in a iield or a smokestack
as a symbol oi China's industrial progress.

One photograph that especially in-
trigued him was a photograph oi West
Lkae, a traditionally scenic spot in China
Explaining its signilicance he said, “In all
the conventional paintings, the traditional
Chinese paintings. you'd always have
willow trees hanging by the lake and a
peaceful little Chinese boat. maybe a Junk
With a sail, lying motionless on the water
and maybe a iisherman. not really cut
ching anything, There are literally tells of

thousands of paintings like this, One of the
photos in the exhibition returns to exactly
the same scene and it's just a lyrical thing
with the shimmering light on the lake and
the hills in the background and its shot
through the trailings of the willow, so the
willow is very close up in the camera lens.

“But instead of the old fishing vessel,
there's just a canoe, maybe even a racing
kayak, really low slung, in the ioreground
where the conventional boat would have
been, But what seems to me is so clever
about the photograph is mat behind the
kayak you can see a wake, so you realize
that the guy is acutally out for exercise.
The one symbol of what he's doing is this
steam of white, which thus separates him
out from the lazy person of a previous
dynasty. This is a guy keeping lit in the

“there‘s no question. . , we want to be back
here as soon as possible."

Although the construction is urrently
behind schedule in some areas, it is ahead
in others. The book slacks for the pens
[house floors are delayed over a month and
will not arrive until July 4. However,
McKee explained that the crew is working
on other things and “making up the lost
time as [it goes] along." According to
McKee, the crew would like to start work
on the mezzanine right now, but he will not
allow this until after finals, “Everyone is
committed to finishing on schedule,” said
McKee. Barring any unforseen delays, he
is confident that Burling will be usable in
students when the college reopens this iall,

name oi the People’s Republic. Things like
that encourage me to look for new levels of
symbols in Chinese photography."

Spence felt one oi the more interesting
movements in the resurgence of western
music and dance. He sees in this quite a
change from the cultural revolution: in»
sistance on indigenous art forms and its
.purge of all {arms or westernization. Yet,
he emphasized that the Chinese hope for a
synthesis of the two traditions rather than
a western dominance in art, Spence sees
these two movements in the Chinese arts
as significant comments on Chinese
culture. iteierring to Bai Hua's script he
said it may be quite a while before we can
assess the impact oi Chinese again ”play-
ing and discussing Chopin."
