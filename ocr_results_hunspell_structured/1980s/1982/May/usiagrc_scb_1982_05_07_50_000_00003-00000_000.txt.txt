Drake, they will “discuss iewer speciiic
issues this time" as opposed to their
February meeting when they decided the
budget, However, they will have an
unusual amount of contact with students
According to Drake, “a vast majority” oi
the trustees have indicated that they would
like to attend 11 o‘clock classes and
possibly eat lunch in the dining halls with
students. Drake‘s secretary, Helen wiese,
explained that each trustee will be
presented with two meal tickets, one for
personal use and one tor the professor
whose class they attend The proiessor is
then supposed to announce to his or her

class that interested students may also
come to lunch with them The collegn Will
foot the bill for those students not current
ly on board who would like to eat with a
trustee.

After lunch, those trustees who do not
have prior commitments will participate
in their annual Open forum with students at
1:30 pm, in South Lounge.

According to Drake, some of the issues
which the Trustees will discuss are various
aspects oi buildings and grounds, summer
projects, GTE’s recabling on the campus
and the restoration of Grinnell House.
They will also discuss personnel decisions,
including sabatical ieaves and contracts

The new Grinnell Community Center, at
the corner oi 4th and Park Streets, will be
dedicated at around 4 pm. on the 15th of
this month. Although the center has
already been open for about one month,
Parks and Recreation Director Brian Katz
said the ribbon cutting and other
ceremonies will mark the official opening.

The center contains a small gym, an
auditorium with 420 seats and a balcony
with a capacity for no more seats that are
not yet installed. In addition, the center
will house an art gallery and all govern»
ment offices. The center will consolidate
many offices that are now scattered
throughout the town in various small
quarters. Katz said that there will now be
more room for the several government
services offices and there will still be room
for cultural and soclal events in the same
place.

The center was built in the former Grin»
nell High School with money raised in a
bond issue passed two years ago. The bond
issue convered only the costs at gutting
and refurbishing the two existing struc-
tures and building and decorating the in-
sides. Lighting, seats, audio capabilities
and storage space are still needed for the
theater and donations are needed for the
, art gallery. No iederal help was available

to iund the project which took two years to
construe: ‘

The architecture of the center, which
was done by Woodburn and O'Neill of Des
Moines. stresses spacious clean corridors
and brightly painted wall graphics
reminiscent of the style used in some
newer high schools. Ramps and specially
designed water iountains make the center
towlly accessable to the handicapped. The
wide corridors and staircases were built to
handle the heavy flow of traffic that is ex~
pected in the center once everyone moves
in and more events are scheduled,

A small fee (25 cents) is charged to use
the gym and Katz estimates an increase in
the charge to 75 cents soon aiter the open-
ing ceremonies. Since there are no
iacilities ior racketball, swimming or
large athletic events, town residents will
continue to use the college PEC during
town hours ior those activities. The come
munity center is available tor use by col
lege students at the same iee that is charg-
ed to townspeople. The theater will be used
primarily by the high school ior various
performances as well as by diiierent civic

~groups for performances and meetings.

The theater is architecturally simple, but
wellrdecorated and comiortable ior
viewers.

.The Pub gets a face lift

Plans include moving bar, new

cl ‘ a a pa ' t
oors nd tn
by Richard Letchinger

It all goes as planned over the summer,
Grinnellians will return to a newly
renovated Pub Club in August, one that
current Pub Manager Dave Coad hopes
will be both nicer looking and less cone
gested,

A sub-committee of the Pub board has
been working on the plans with help irom
Professor John Worley, Pub board
member. Pending approval irom the full
Pub board. work should begin at the end of
the semester on an estimated $7,000 worth
of improvements in the facility located in
the basement of Main Hall.

"The iloor and the ceiling are the pits,"
Coad said, and as a result the work was be
ing ”done out oi necessity."

Plans to renovate the Pub were to be
completed last summer, according to
Coad, but other construction had to take
priority in order to meet the regulations oi
the state iire inspector.

Some minor changes in the Pub include
the installation of a new floor and ceiling,
as well as some new plumbing and elec-
trical work and an overall paint job.

However, the biggest change will be a
completely new iloor plan. Coad explained
that a new door would be installed in the
wall directly in front of the outer entrance
which would necessitate removing some of
the booths in the deli. In addition. the bar
will be moved along the wall where the
current door to the Pub is located.
Everyone would then enter directly into
the deli through a double set 0[ crash
doors, and the present door would only be
used for deliveries behind the bar.

ob

JCoad noted that the new entrance will
cut down on the congestion at the door and
should create a better traffic flow within
the Pub itself, The new entrance will also
allow noanub Club members to purchase
items from the deli without actually enter- -
ing the Pub.

The new plans also call tor the creation
oi a coat rack and book storage area in one
oi the closets in the hallway that is present
ly b‘eing used [or storage.

In its capacity as landlord to the Pllh the
college will be doing the work on ll.» [bdrm
bing and re-tiling oi the iloor Worley
estimated the cost of that work at about
$4,000. The other work will be (lone at the
Pub's expense under Worley's supervir
sion. “1 play the part oi the contractor tor
the Pub's side of the work," Worley said,
“acting on behalf of the Pub board." Two
students will also be employed ior iour to
eight weeks over the summer to help with
the renovating.

Coad explained that the new design
should help to alleviate congestion not only
at the door, but throughout the Pub,
“There will be less congestion at the door,
and it should be easier to move around
without getting bumped and pushed by the
crowd," Coad explained

In addition to the structural changes,
Coad added they hoped to do some work on
fixing the present tables, and possibly
even purchase some new ones.

Coad commented that there would be
generally more bal- space and more room
inside the Pub after the renovation. He
noted, “The place will be a lot nicer next -
year."
