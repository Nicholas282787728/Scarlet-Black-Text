Grinnell oilers a variety or physical
education Classes for Interested students.
Whether one is Interested in aerobic dance
ing or scuba diving, the facilities and me
stuctors are available. Each student
enrolled in a PE. class has a different set
of reasons for being there.

LIZ deGraw, a student in .lohn Harvey’s
flexibility and aerobics class, said she
enrolled because She wanted “some kind
of physical activity," She believed the
class creates' motivation” and that it
“establishes a routine that can become a
good habit. " other P. E. students cited

meeting new friends, improved
physical health," “learning a uselul skill,"
or simply “having fun" as motivation for
joining a class, Overall, physical educa»
tion Classes add to the “Grinnell EX~
perience."

No football players also mentioned the
ilexibility of the programs. They said that
with permission lrom an instructor, one
can design his own physical improvement
program and get credit for it. They have
designed their own weight training pro
gram which they follow when they are not
training lor football, The PE department
also has a regularly scheduled weight lif-
ting class for those who would rather not
design their own programs.

Although many Grinnell students are ac-
tive in sports, comparatively iew are
enrolled in P.E. classes. Students not take
ihg P.E. classes mentioned participation
in varsity or l.M, sports and lack of time as
reasons for avoiding P.E. classes. One stu-
dent, Talmadge Brenner, was blatantly

honest in citing his reason for avoiding
P.E. classes: “I'm lazy.”

One ma. class this semester is being
taught entirely by students. Tim Poland
and Scott Goldstein teach a weight train-
ing class four afternoons each week. Ac-
cording tD Poland, there were originally 15
people in the class but between three and
five new people have been coming each
week so there are now about 30 people‘ln
the class

Poland said there is an equal number of
men and women in the class. He was par-
ticularly interested in getting women “17
terested in weight liiting because he ielt
that many had fears oi becoming “huge."
He emphaSized that he and Goldstein have
designed a program that is tailored to the
individual; some people lift to become
more physically lit, while others “body
build."

Poland said that the class is more fun
than he had originally thought it would be
and hoped that weight training will now
become more accepted. He wants to
“clear up the image oi weight trainers as
‘muscle-bound' freaks."

Poland and Goldstein have divided the
class into two groups, those who wish to
imm‘ove their cardiovascular fitness and
endurance do circuit training with ﬁle
universal gym with Goldsetin, while those
working on "body building" or training for
sports use the free weight room with
Poland.

Poland and Goldstein feel that everyone
in the class has a "good attitude” and en»
joys the class. Although they both enjoy
