feel mat I can give this to SGA. My ex-
perience as a halt president tor two
semesters served to introduce me to SGA
But undoubtedly the most valuable exe
perienee tor me was my participation on
the Student Rules Committee, where one
of Our projects has been the revision of the
Constitution. This has required that I work
closely with the administration, giving me
valuable exposure to the interaction bet-
ween SGA and the college.
