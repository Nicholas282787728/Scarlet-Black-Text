Senior suspended for disobeying J.C. SOHC‘I‘IOI‘IS

by Ellen Heath

At a Judicial Council hearing Sunday,
Nov. 14, senior Tom Hanseter was found
guilty of neglecting to obey Judicial Coun-
cil rulings and has been suspended from
the college for the 195233 school year. Te
Judicial Council hearing was Hanseter’s
third this semester.

Hanseter’s first encounter with the coun-
cil was on Sept. 4, when he was charged
with tampering with the tire alarm system
in Rawson Hall. He pleaded not guilty to
the charge on the grounds that the alarm
he was said to have tampered with was not
damaged, However, the council found him
guilty and recommended a threcpart
sentence to President Drake wliD approved
the sentence. The council advised that the
defendant be subject to conduct probation
in keeping with page 37 or the Student
Handbook which states that if under con-
duct probation a person's status as a stu-
dent is in serious jeopardy and that further
violation may result in suspension from
the college.

The second part of the recommendation
stated that “any further violation having
to do with the [ire alarm system will result
in the defendant's dismissal from Grinnell
College,” according to Judical Council
Chairperson Rick Richardson in the Sept.
10 issue of die 5&3. In the third point the

council asked for the revocation of ‘

Hanseter's privilege to live in the
residence halls. Under this sentencing he
had two weeks to find off-campus housing

and move out of the dormitory. It is this
third point which was the cause of subse
quent problems. Hanseter was called
before the Judicial Council again on Oct. 28
to face charges of still living in the
residence halls, According to Craig Raslle,
a council member, it had been rumored
that l-lanseter was sleeping and taking
showers in the dormitories, a direct
disobeyal of a Judicial Council ruling. He
had also neglected to submit proof to Dean
James Tederman that he was living off
campus.

A residence hall maid testified before
the council that she saw Hanseter sleeping
in the room of a student who was out of
tOWn, but there was insufficient evidence
to prove that he was actually still living in
the dorms, so he was found not guilty. The
council wanted to clarify the definition of
living oil-campus, though, and Drake sent
Hanseter a letter stipulating that he Could
not sleep at night in a dorm or take
showers in one and that any violation of
these sanctions would result in immediate
suspension. He was also told he could not
be in the residence halls between 12 am.
and 8 a.m. Hanseter appealed the sentence
and Drake changed the hours from 1 a.m.
and E a.m.

At the hearing on Nov. 14, Rasile was ac-
ting chairperson because Richardson
brought the charges against Hanseter to
me council himself. Richardson said he
saw Hanseter in Rawson Hall playing

SGA rules and procedures
dominate meeting

by Nancy L. Radermecher

In a continuing effort to involve and in-
form students of student government af-
fairs, a new bylaw to increase the duties of
Joint Board representatives was discussed
at Wednesday nights sea meeting. Pro-
posed by Haines Hall President Pete Haut—
zinger, the bylaw requires representatives
to post their position on roll call votes for
their constituency each week following
Joint Board meetings. Failure to comply
with the bylaw would result in removal
from Joint Board unless ”sufficient
justification for failing to post a note ex—
ists.”

Speaking for his bylaw proposal, Hautzr
inger pointed out that, “even if people on
campus are aware (of SGA activities). . .
they still don’t know how their reps voted."
Already anticipating arguments over the
increasing number of bylaws being con-
sidered, Hautzinger added, “Our role is to
do everything we can to make this a more
responsible body. . . and if it takes a bylaw
to do it, that’s what we have to do.”

Continuing the discussion, Norris Hall
COrPresident Raf Stein expressed his sup
port for the intent of the bylaw but ques-
tioned its effectiveness asking, “Five
years down the road, will anyone
remember this? ”

Loose Hall President Katharine
Altemus, the only representative to speak
against the motion, eitpressed her disap-
proval saying, “Everyone here is getting
so bogged down (w/bylaws). . r " She
maintained mat JB is already paying an
administrative assistant to communicate
SGA actions to the students. Said Altemus,
“I can find more valuable things to do with
my time." Debate soon ended and the
bylaw passed by a wide margin.

Student Rules Committee Chairman
Eric Pedicini then asked for JB approval
of four recommendations for standing
rules to be included in the revised SGA
constitution. They were 1) the stipulation
of a regular Joint Board meeting time, 2) a
rule requiring the binding of sea minutes,
’3) a limitation on the number of speeches
allowed to representatives on each topic
and 4) a call for the increased adherence to
ainile of parliamentary procedure which
dictates that, at. meetings, “an air or
courtesy shall be maintained- tandli.» i .
under no circumstances is a speaker other
than the chair to direct his speech to an in-
dividual."

Responding to the last recommendation
(and directing his commentsto the chair),
Read Hall President Vic Rudolph said,
“I’m not sure what the intent of the last

part is . . " He further stated that “a little
spice' at .18 meetings is not necessarily
undesirable.

Pedicini responded to his comments say~
ing that the rule's inclusion was primarily
to insure courteous behavior at meetings.
However, because it is a reiteration of an
already existing rule of parliamentary
procedure, be revoked the recommendas
tion in order to end discussion. The other
three recommendations were then passed.

SPStR Chairman Richard Letchinger
reported that his committee had received
a “tentative 0K" from the college to pay
for the upcoming renovation of KDIC. The
committee is now deciding whether the
station should be set up to operate at
100, 500 or 1,000 watts after the renovation.

cards after the 1 a.m. deadline and felt it
was his duty as Judicial Council chairper-
son to press charges, Hanseter pleaded
guilty. Hanseter was also charged with
failing to give information about his off
campus living arrangement to Tederman
after Drake told him he would have to
within a week. He Said he had not yet
received the information from his
landlady.

During the hearing Hanseter was
reminded that the stipulation of his
Violating Judicial'Council rulings would be
suspension. Asked whether or not he
though he should be suspended, he replied,
“Of course I don’t think I should be
suspended." He said he did not think his
sleeping in the dorms was a threat to peo»
ple and he did not think of the conse~
quences of his playing cards more at the
time.

Also during the proceedings on Sunday,
Hanseter was questioned whether he
thought the council had any choice but to
suspend him, in View of the previous
stipulation about violation of his sentence.
Hanseter replied, “If you go by what's
written they don't have a choice. , . but
what do you think l am, some criminal
who’s got to be back in the pen by one
o'clock?"

Richardson said, “If the Council makes
any other decision besides suspension
they’re not following what they’re suppos-
ed to do. . . not following up on what

Drake decided." Hanseter answered, “I
see what you're saying but 1 don’t think
student government is going to collapse if
you don’t go by the letter. . (students) will
have more of a negative View of you if you
do suspend me.”

Richardson called Drake‘s letter to
Hanseter an “if-then statement,” as far as
suspension was concerned, and said that it
was not a question of the council's punish
ment but that Hanseter had‘brought the
punishment upon himself

Hanseter said the suspensmn “would be
quite an affect on my life,” He added, “I do
respect laws; maybe not this law because I
think it’s unfair,‘Y Tederman charged
Hanseter with “making a mockery of the
judicial process,”and said the“question is
that you just consciously decided not to
pay any attention to the judicial process or
the college." He added that he felt the
council had "bent over backward" to be
fair to Hanseter.

After hearing the evidence and
arguments of both Richardson and
Hanseter, the Judicial Council cleared the
room and deliberated for approximately
one hour. When he received the council’s
recommendation of suspension, Drake ims

. mediately sent a letter to Hanseter informr

ing him of his approval of the sentence.
The suspension took effect Nov, 16 but
Hanseter may appeal before Nov. 27.

Murner attributed the success of the
telethon to “the people who called.” He ad—
ded that the workers “firmly believed” in
the cause, since the money raised will

benefit everyone.

The funds raised from the telethon are
used to pay the ditterence between tuition
and the actual expense to the college for
each student on campus. The cost to the
college ior each student is approximately
33 percent higher than the actual tuition
charged.

 

Grinnell’s location cause of no women profs

by Catherine Ingrassia

N0 substantial gains in the number of
women and minorities employed by Grins
nell College have been made since lens. in
fact, since 1980, the number‘of women
faculty members has declined by 2.5 para
cent. No women on the faculty are current-
ly full professors, whereas in 1978, 7.5 per-
cent of the professors were female. In
terms of tenured positions, five women are
tenured in comparison to 57 men.

This information was compiled for the
1982 comprehensive report of the Affir—
mative Action Committee. Viewed alone,
the statistics would seem to indicate some
sort of discrimination in hiring policies.
However, these figures seem to be a result
of the lack of appeal a school like Grinnell
has for minorities and women, rather than
in actual discrimination on the part of the
college.

The Affirmative Action Program pam-
phlet, prepared in 1980 states, “a family-
oriented small town with no minority com-
munity may not be immediately attractive
to minority. persons, to single women, or
those in'twocareer families.ir,_ . . ,

William Deminoff, Affirmative Action
officer, believes this fact lowers the
number ot people willing to accept a job in
this community. “Young women just don't
find Grinnell an appealing type of place.
When forced to choose between Grinnell,
1a., and Baltimore. Md, they'll usually

take Baltimore." he noted.

But Deminoff feels in depth research is
imperative “to find out why, even with our
best efforts, there has been no gain.” when
asked about the actual decline in the
number of female professors, Deminol‘f at-
tributed it to “just retirements.” He added
mat since “the pool of women and
minorites gets smaller and smaller as we
go up, it becomes more difficult to get
women and minorities to fill upper level
positions."

The percentage of women under the
category “other faculty," which includes
library faculty, GRMS taculty, leave
replacements and lecturers, is relatively
high at 42.3 percent,

Since no systematic research has been
done, no one cause can be cited for the low
percentage of women faculty members.
But- Deminoff offered the idea that
historically women have been more suc»
cessiul in obtaining “lower positions," and
the figpr flect this diti’o'p Th'eiargje

n non-professional an H clerical
pesitmos also reﬂects this trend, ' '
Grinnell's Affirmative Action Advisory
Committee is very strong in their in-
sistence that the guidelines are followed.
The mandatory policy Grinnell has in—
stituted is one of the most detailed in the

’country.

“it there's any difficulty with the policy,
it may be the need for some flexibility in
it,” Stated Deminoff. The current process
for search for job replacements is rather

. cumbersome and time'consuming. .

To alleviate this problem ‘and facilitate
the process, Deminoff hopes a computer
system will be instituted by fall. He ex-
plained, “Computer programs prepared so
we can have access to records in process
would help us immensely.“

In an informal Survey done with Grin-
nell’s sister schools Grinnell‘s Affirmative
Action program is “evidently way ahead,"
according to Deminoff. Grinnell's
guidelines are detailed, amended, and
mandatory, whereas guidelines do not
even exist at some institutions.

The problem remains ‘one not easily
solved. Comparative data indicates that
generally the proportion of male to temale
applicants Grinnell receives for a given
position is similar to that of the available
national pool. The crux of the matter lies in
Grinnell's low .degree .of .desirabilitylor
the type of applicanls it seeks.

Finding a solution is a problem the col—
lege must new address. Deminoff believes
that research must be done ”to find out
why we’re not having any movement.” Uri»
til that time, firm plans for improvement
and change cannot be made.
