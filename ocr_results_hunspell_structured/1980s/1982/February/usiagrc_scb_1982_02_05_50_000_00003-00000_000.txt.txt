The last Marshall Scholar from Grinnell.
Susan Ashbrook. graduated In 1975. This
year. however. not one but two Grinnell
seniors managed to be among the do
American students from around the coun
try chosen by the British Government to
pursue graduate degrees at universities in
the British Isles Jim Goodfellow. 3 Russ
slain/Economics major and Chris Johnson.
a chemistry/Russian major will receive
full tuition for two or three years of
graduate study in addition to that roughly
$7.000 per year will be provided ior living
expenses and a travel and book allowance

Goodfellow commented that it's im-
pressive for a school the size of Grinnell to
have two winners inane year. He feels that
Grinnell will continue to do better in the
future " The majority of Marshall
Scholars come from Ivy League colleges.
but Goodfellow thinks that Grinnell‘s size
is an advantage because of "the excellent
counseling available.” He explained that
Professors McCarthy and Mayer "were
very helpful in helping me form my pro-
posal . . they had all the time in the world
for me.‘

As one might expect. the competition
according to Goodfellow. is “stiff ” A stu-
dent needs to show proven potential to con-
tribute academically at a British Universi-
ty and proven potential to be a leader of his
generation. Both Johnson and Goodfellow
are Dean‘s list students and in olved in a
number olextra-curricular acti ties Pro-
lessor Don Smith. faculty advisor [or both
the Marshall and the Somewhat come
parable Rhodes Scholarships. explained
that he asks faculty to recommend
students that they feel are qualiiicd. but he
stressed that “anyone can come and talk
to me "

One of the differences between the two
British scholarships is that the student’s
school must approve him as a Marshall ap-
plicant There are five Marshall regions in
the US and out of each region 20 finalism
are chosen. The final 30 winners are then
selected irom this group

Unfortunately chris Johnson has been
out oi town and consequently unavailable
for comments about winning Goodfellow
however explained that he was very sure
prised to be a finalist since the Marshall
scholarship is “so academic." He feels
they place importance on independent
research and given his interest in internar
tional relations and the location of Grins
ncil. he ieit his background in independent
research was lacking

finalists though Goodfellow felt confident
because he interviews well He found the
Marshall interviewers "aggressive" and
the British Consulate General -"particular-
ly pithy." "You‘re really under iire during
the interview . it‘s you against six people
for 45 minutes non-stop." Goodfellow Said.

He gave examples of questions asked.
noting some intentional "trap questions"
thrown at him For example. he was asked
about the SA L,T. fl treaty and what
Goodfellow thought about the Backfire
Bomber in relation to the treaty The
Backfire Bomber. however. is not covered
by the S.A.L.T. ll Treaty. In addition he
found himself debating with a nuclear
physicist about the merits. types and
potential for a nuclear war. and trying to
explain his "impression oi the Soviet
Union? where he lived last summer.

Upon learninghe‘d won. Goodlellow said
that his reaction was “at first to take it in
stride, but as the days go by. excitement
builds and the realization of studying at a
British University hits you "

Goodfellow hopes to attend Ute London
School of Economics contingent on his ac-
ceptance there. He admits that 98 percent
of all Marshall Scholars are accepted at
their first choice school He hopes to study
lor the three year Masters of Science in
Economics degree Goodfellow would like
to spend his vacations in the U.S SR. since
he has "an affinity" for the Russians.
After completion or the Marshall program.
he plans to return to the U.S. to attend law
school. Chris Johnson has chosen to attend
Oxford UniverSity where he will pursue an
honors degree in biochemistry

The British method or education. par
ticularly at the college and graduate
levels. is known for the high degree of in
dependence and sell motivation required
on the part of students. Rather than
preparing graded assignments throughout
the year. the British student generally
spends his entire year preparing ior iinai
exams in May. Class discussion is not fre-
quent nor is student evaluation
Goodlellow is excited about the difference.
though and sees ”the potential for self
motivation " He feels Grinnell has
prepared him to deal with this "Grinnell
has taught me how to learn. how to be
motivated Within rigorous guidelines "
whilc he'll only be meeting with one tutor
twice a week. he sees this as "very little.

. but intense Contacl." and explained that he

expects to have to bc more prepared than
for a meeting with an American prolcssor.
