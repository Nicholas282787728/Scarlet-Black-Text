Setting the record straight

The point that we attempted to stop peo-
ple Irom going to work is a valid . .d
troublesome one. It vt‘ds all unlol’tunalc but
unavoidable byproduct oi our statcd goal
oi shutting the arsenal lor a day.

But is this forcing our idology on other
people? it may appear so to some. Yel
members Dl the Grinnell group discussed
the issues with counterprotcstors. even
mutually realizing common values and
goals. We discussed |he situation with
police officers 5 well. both before and
after we were arrested. The point is. we
both talked AND listened. andeept an
open mind. Did Tom Elsscnberg do the
same with us" Who badgel‘ed and
alienated who here?

Can we fairly he described as living the

"sheltered life of the academic"? That .

Would imply one who gels his inlormation
lrom books and art' ' and who makes
judgements and de ns that are highly
theoretical. Yet we were actually involv-
cd. a vital and tangible presence. talking

Bandying terms

Please note the iollowing correction to
Jill Petty's article "McNamara proposes
solutions.‘ Nov. a. less; Caspar
Weinberger is not the present Secretary or
state. George Schultz is. Caspar
Woriiberger serves as current Secretary oi
Defense 7 the same position held by
McNamara irom 1961-1967.

Also. the headline on Jonathan
Gl'eising‘s article on Mr. Theilman's visit
to campus is highly misleading (“Massive
retaliation key to nuclear strategy").
Massive retaliation reiers to the United
States‘ response to a Soviet Union tirst
strike. what kind oi nuclear strategy does
this term imply other than out and out
nuclear war, it would have been far better

“Peace through deterrence key to
nuclear strategy.” while this presumably

entails a build-up ol arms so that a
massive retaliation might be possible. the
key difference is that the original headline
implies a use of massive retaliation
whereas the second refers only to the
capabilities oi such. Headlines like the one
used for Mr Gre ng's article merely
perpetuate the rear oi a Soviet first strike,
Furthermore it misrepresents Mr
'l'heilman's views, It is upsetting that atan
institution of higher learning such as Grin-
rieli. we handy terms around without real-
ly stopping to think about what those terms
actually mean and imply,

‘ Kaila E. llaines '86
The error in Mr. Wrinbergcr‘s tide was an

editorial oversight, but the headline correctly

represents Mr. Theitmons views, as seen by the
s and B sin/f.
