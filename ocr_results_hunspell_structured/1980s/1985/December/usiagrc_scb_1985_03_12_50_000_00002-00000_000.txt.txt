Richards and Welch take top SGA posts

by Paula Rue
For the lirst time in Grinnell history,
student government will leature two
women in the top posts. Susannah
Richards, ‘36, and Pam Welch. ‘86,
were elected 1985-1986 student body
president and viceepresident last week.
Richards eastly out-distanced her
male opponents and nearly took a ma
jority ot the ballots in the lirst round.
.Welch pulled a upset as a
write-in candidate. Both offices went to
a run—oft — Richards against Michael
Marcus and Welch against Mike Miller,
During her term in office. Richards
plans to increase contact between Grin-
nell and me other ACM schools. It
would be in our interest to find out how
some ol their organizations are run, she
said. and we could exchange informa-
tion about how their student bodies feel
when it comes to making political
statements. In this respect. students
might have a stronger impact.
ltlcnards would like to see the
development ol more positive attitudes
on the part of the college students in the

area of townrgown relations Richards
mentioned that there are opportunities
lor students to get involved in such town
activities as the nursing home. the
Grinnell Day Care Center. and a big
brother/sister program. she also sug
gested that people troin the town might
come and give talks, should they be in»
terested.

> Another big issue that students will
lace is the alcohol policy proposed by
the Committee on Student Lli'e, She said
that students should be open inded
about the policy because it is very
liberal and the CSL has considered all
sides of the issue.

”Students will have to deal with the
drinking-age going up. and the CSL has
come up with what appears to be a very
reasonable proposal." Richards said

In general. Richards [eels that the
credibility oi SGA has gone up. The
SGA is here to represent students. and
Susannah would like to see the SGA be
effective in dealing with student con,
cerns in the coming school year.

Welch agrees with Richards that the
Students are more aware oi the SGA'
role and are better at getting involved.
She said that one way in which students
could be aware 01 what is available on
campus occurs during New- Student
Days

Every year during the lreshman
orientation. all the student groups have
organizational booths in the Forum.
Welch would like to see that continued.
she said that it is one ot the big ways in
which students are aware 01 what is
available on Campus.

Welch agrees that we should increase
Contact with other ACM schools
because we might be able to run our
organizations more eli'ectlvely by leare
ning lrom other schools’ successes and
lailures. Ill turn. other schools may be
able to learn lrom us.

Welch would like to see students lake
hall council more seriously next year. it
students are aware oi what SGA actual-
ly does for them. they might take their
llall elections more seriously.

"I ran as a write-in candidate at the
last minute because I tell that the
students needed a more pragmatic can-
didate." Welch said “I talked to many
students and quite a iew said that they
were not planning on voting in the vice
presidential election because 1) they
either dldn'l agree with what the can-
didate stood for Dr 2) none at the cane
didates would make a constructive cane
didate. Therefore. 1 ran as an alter-
native to round out the personalities in
the candidacy so the students could
take this election seriously. I truly
believe that l am more representative
oi the student body, because I know
many ditierent types ol students," she
said
