Revolution who knew Mao Tsar
Tungi Now Grinnell College is much more
interested in the "East Wind”, as we in-
vest over a million dollars in our new
Chinese studies program. The first visiting
oroiessor in this endeavor is an illustrious
scholar 7 Chin. educated in Canada and
the USA. yet proudly Chinese.

when Criiinell alumnus K J, Wu attends

was nicknamed ”The SmoAmerican ons

student who passed the graduation examl
received a Boxter indemnity scholarship
to study abroad. K, J, Wu sueceeed, and

mayor oi Shanghai. now a city with over 12
million inhabitants.

The next ruture Crinnellian to graduate
TsingHua was none other than Chin. in
1935. At that time the Sino»British Baxter
liidemnity Scholarship was awarded an
llually to the top twenty scorers in a na»
tioiial competitive exam. oi which Chin
was one. He was oiiereil a lull scholarship
to either Cambridge University or London
School oi Political Economy. but the
Japanese blockade oi England forced Chili
to attend instead the University oi Toronto
Law School in Canada. where he received
their highest degree.

He then became a research ielloiv at the
University oi Chicago ironi 104271047, He
was draited during the latter part oi his
stay in Chicago but he escaped boot camp

about 7,000 students. While Fudan has ex-
tensive connections in the US. including
Harvard the University oi Chicago and
UC Berkeley. this year marks the beginns
ing oi the Fudan Grinnell connections

But this certainly is not the first

Gl'inllcll Cliinzt connection. That connec-
tion dates back to before World War I
when Grlniicll College already had ml
sionaries in China This link gi-cw stronger
in the 1920's. as the Grilincll-i‘un Porter
Middle School ior boys in Shantung pro-
vince attracted hundred of future Chinese
scholars and statesmen. The Japanese
closed the Porter School in 1930. and only
now Grinnell is once again reaching out to
Ch' :1. "I'm looking forward to seeing
Gl‘lmtell re-establlsh Connections with the
Chinese academic community.” Professor
Chin says

He says that at least half of the pro-
lcssol‘s at Fudan University have studied
in Europe or America, And now that Sino-
American relations have been resumed.
Chinese students are encouraged to study
in America, And. as well as the govern
nient sending Chinese students abroad.
Eudan University invites scores oi
American scholars to teach at their school
every year. in 19in iormer Grinnell Prn-

the lecture they just climbed right through
the window,” Professor Chin recalls.

Pal'l street ll'ﬁSlllIlBll rains: it] move

11y Valerie Ingram

Students living at 1205 Park Street, one
of Grinnell's oft-Campus houses, have been
told by the Office of Student Affairs that
they will be moved into onscampus housing
bv November 15, 19115. Dean of Student Afr
fairs. Jim Tederman, said that this move
is necessary because renovation on 1205
must start by December in order for the
house to be ready ior upperclassmen housV
ing in the [all of 1986. If that is the case.
1205 residents wonder why they have to be
out by November 15. Greg Fringle said.
“There's no need to start the renovation

. until the end of the semester The job could
be done in two months With a quality
rcrew.” ‘

”If the students stay." Tederman said.
“It will cause a two-year delay in the
renovation cycle.” He added, “We had not
originally intended to use 1205 for housing,
especially not ior ireshmen, but we had 35
more ireshmen than expected so we had to
use it."

The Students’ response. in the words of
1205’s student adviser. Patty McGrane, is
”We refuse to move,"

it appears that there has been a lack of
Communication between the administl'as
tion and the students. Before school
started the residents of 1205 Park were told
that their housing stituation would be tems

porary and that they would be moved into
dorms as soon as possible, As this “tem-
porary" situation entered its sixth week.
Tederman, in an interview with 1205
residents in his oitice, said that priority
had been given to “triples with iour people
in them and students in lounges.”

when no moves were mentioned aitcr a
iew weeks. the residents oi 1205 began to
think that they would be allowed to stay
there. This boiler was reiniorced when a
memo was sent to each resident oi 1205
irom Student Aiiairs, dated “August.

1985." This memo listed the order in which .

room changes would be made 1205's situa»
tion as a freshmen house was listed last of
live categories, The memo also said that
though “Students in temporary housing
must move when a space becomes
available, (An exception will be when all
occupants are content in the living Situa'
tion and agree that no one needs to
movc.)"

When asked about this, Tcdorman pro-
duced a memo dated September, 19135, and
addressed to “Students In Quads” that also
cited the above “exception." Said Teder-
man. “i don't know how students (at 1205
Park) received that memo It was" t in-
tended ior them and it doesnt apply to
them Tederman was correct in sayinll.

llﬂSGlIllelll lll'BSBlllS socialism lallis

By Mark Hreiiidel

Question: What’s the difference between
developed socialism and existing
socialism?

Answer: Very little Existlng socialism
is not developed. and developed socialism
does not exist.

lvan Volgyes raised the question oi the
existence of developed socialism in the
keynote speech oi ”Developed Socialism in
the 1580's". the 1935 Eastern European
Conference sponsored by the Rosenfield
Public Affairs Program as part of the Col~
lege's Russian and Eastern European
Special Events Series. /

Tile symposium took place on Wednos
day and Thursday of this week, and
ieatured lectures on Hungary, Yugoslavia.
Poland and the Soviet Union. culminating
ill a panel discussion in which all of the
speakers discussed “The Socialist World
Today: Similarities. Dilferences, and the
Soviet Union."

Rutgers pi-oicssor and noted scholar
lvan Volgyes kicked off the program with
a lecture on his homeland, Hungary. Mr.
Volgyes subtitled his speech, “Hungary in
malaise, a sickness ihiiily disguised." ior
he perceives the country to be on the verge
of a huge political and economic crisis,
Calling the situation "tragic."

Volgyes sees the collapse coming slowly
—and inevitably. For, regardless oi the ap-
parently positive economic advancement
oi recent years lindicated hy Hungary's
entrance into the international Finance
Corporation and the international
Development Association last April), Mr.
Volgyes believes that Hungary's
“socialist” economy, kept in place there
by the USSR by means oiaocoo troops, can
not generate enough capital to bring about
long- -term economic growth or even
maintenance at their existing economic
position.

Mr Volgyes cites iive types at dissenr
slon in Hungary: political. economic, nas
tionalistic, ecological and intellectual.

Political dissenters desire a pluralistic
political system. Although Hungary now
allows, and even requires opposition in
provincial elections, a second party with a
separate platiorm does not exist. Mr.
Voigyes is doubtiul oi the eventual adop-
tion oi a true pluralistic system. and says
that the one move that could incur a Soviet
iiivasmn would be the obvious displace-
ment of the Communist Party as the
leading political iorce in Hungary

The few economic dissenters which exist
at present simply desire a more rational
