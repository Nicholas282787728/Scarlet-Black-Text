Free Room is part of Dean’s proposal

by Robert 0, Quashie

Free room for a semester would be
available to students who would par
ticipate in a program proposed by the
Dean of Students which would straighten
out some of the confusion involved with
campus government.

According to Student Government Vice
President Mary Kosrnidis. a proposal has
been distributed among hall council
members which, it approved. would do
away with the Hall Co-ordinalors and
Presidents while creating the new posi
tions of Resident Assistant and Senator,

The proposal was written by Dean
James Tiederman based on his discussion
with the SGA cabinet about Joint Board
and Hall Council overlaps. Kosmidis said.

Duties ol the resident assistant would in-
clude the planning of hall social activities.
responding to students locked out of
rooms. posting SGA news and helping stu-
dent advisers assess the needs on their

given floors.

in return, the resident assistant would
receive one semester of tree room. a single
room and a private telephone.

According to the proposal, the ap»
plicants would need one year of prior ex-
perience as a student advisor.

Kosmidis said the proposal will be
discussed between Tiederman, herself and
SGA president Matthew Golden, over
lunch betore tomorrow night’s Joint Board
meeting where the proposal will be up tor
further discussion.

Also included in the proposal are provi»
sions tor Campus Senators. According to
the proposal. Joint Board representatives
would no longer be elected [mm the resi-
dent halls but elected based on campus
section. Seven senators would be elected
from South Campuspll {romvNorth and
one each from Oil-Campus college owned
and noncollege housing respectively.

Unexpected grading policy still
under consideration

by More Kr Way

The catalogue they received as prospeca
tives said that the class would be graded
on a pass/tail basis, in an “informal” set-
ting with an objective to. “Illuminate
methods of inquiry rather than to master
disciplinary material,"

When they arrived as students this [all
the class of '88 was in for a surprise. Those
asked do not remember receiving any
notice that a course which they had signed
up [or without knowing the protessor or die
actual work requirements would be grade
ed: A-Fail,

But for the ﬁrst time freshmen tutorials
were graded in an experiment to deter-
mine if students could not be made to take
their introduction into college more
seriously.

According to Liana Babener. Chairpera
son of the Tutorial Committee, there will
be one more year or grading in the pro-
gram iollowed by a serious reevaluation
alter the fall semester of 1985. “The policy
was introduced to promote more intense
commitment by the students." she said,

Although Babener said that she did not
perceive any such major attitude problem
in her own tutorial classes. most pros
fessors, she said. have expressed the con-
cern that the tutorial may hold a second
class status in the eyes oi the students she
continued.

But argument has stemmed train the
fact that the grades might serve to nullify
the concept to the tutorial as at low
pressure “buffer" course between high
school and college which allows students to
experiment and establish healthy relation-

ships with their advisors, as the program
is described in the 1983434 College
Catalogue which was mailed out to the
students as they made their college choice,

Babener said she did not originally sup
port the change. she believes that although
the grading does cast new light on the
tutorial it does not overwhelmingly detract
from the experience’or stifle the students'
ireedom oi expresslon.

Ray opermiller. who has been in charge
or administering and evalulating both stu-
dent and iaculty surveys concerning the
tutorials reports that although students did
not like the grading in general. the majori-
ty of the (acuity ielt there was more eflort
put lorth by the students.

Obermiller expressed a personal
preference tor ”the non-graded tutorial as
an opportunity lor people to experiment
and learn for the sake 0! learning." but he
also stated that since the Freshman
Tutorial was the only specific coreatype
curriculum requirement it should be main-
tained as a quality course. Many faculty
members [eel grading is the only way to
ensure such quality.

In the ﬁnal determination of the pro
gram structure, both the student and
faculty surveys as well as general laculty
opinion will be taken into consideration.
No decision has been made but Babener
believes that the graded tutorial will even
tuaily become a permanent fixture at
Grinnell College.

Also in the proposal are provisions ao”
hold senatorial elections in the [all rather
than the spring

Other items on the agenda |or tomorrow
night's meeting will be an announcement
oi the final figures for the iaculty survey
on Buffer Days.

in general the iigures can be
characterized as not very positive {mm
the students poiiit oi view Kosmidis said.
In tact, some of the professors responded
that they ielt academic stress was good
and that no extra bulier days were needed
between the semester and iirials to
alleviate that pressure Kosmidis said ‘

A guideline to prohibit the Finance Com»
mittee lrom paying for disc Jockeys at hall
parties will also be discussed along Wth
the approval or Elliot Spagat as chairper-
son oi Committee on student Politics. M

The student Government Association
will meet at 7:30 pm in ARH ll. The
meeting is open to all students. .
