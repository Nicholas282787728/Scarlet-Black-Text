Milosz discusses literature

By Han Cytron

speaking on "Literature and Politics in
Modern Eastern Europe,” Polish poet
Czeslaw Milosz addressed the effects of
Marxism on Eastern Europe in general
and on its literature in particular. Milosz
said of Marxism. “Some intellectuals are
seduced by it [but' in Eastern Europe] no
philosopher no writer oi any caliber
believes in it. "

Winner of the 1978 Neustadt Interna-
tional Prize for Literature and the 1950
Nobel Prize for Literature, Milosz has won
much critical acclaim for his poetry. He
writes his Verse only in Polish

Born in 1911. Milosz has been in voluns
tary exile from his native Poland since
1951. He became a resident of the United
States in 1960 and a naturalized citizen in
1970. Milosz is professor of Slavic
languages and literature at the University
of 01 California at Berkley.

Man is alienated through fear, both
“economic fear” and the (ear of “naked
force." said Milosz. “Marxism proposed to
liberate man from fear . . , just the op-
posite has happened."

Milosz regards the use of naked force the
total abandonment oi philosophy on the
part of Marxist governments. He uses his
poetry to express the search tor the end to
alienation or man by fear.

Milosz stressed the importance or poetry
in Eastern European politics. “The poet is
a symbolic force . l a spiritual leader."
Milosz said. ”Writers are the spokesman
ol public opinion . . against uie rulers.”

While he sees being a spokesman as a
necessary role tor the Eastern European
writer, he laments that poets must pursue

this “noble minded" purpose to the detri-
ment of artistic excellence

“Noble minded poetry becomes old very
soon.” Milosz said. He sees the sacrifice of
artistic excellence in the name of meir
“noble minded" purpose as the dilemma
of Eastern European Literature. Too onen
the literature has. by force of cir-
cumstance. become document rather than
art. he said.

During his lecture he read translations
of several Polish poems which expressed
the alienation of men by fear in Eastern
Europe.

One poem by a fellow Polish poet. which
he read. referred to an evil all consuming
monster, which engulfs everyone and
everything in (ear but when confronted.
reiuses to show itseli to an aggressive Mr.
Coglto. The character Cogito. is a
derivative oi Des Cartes philosophical
statement "Cogito Ergo Sum” ii think
therefore i am t,

Another poet whom Milosz cited wrote.
“I . . . didn't know that what would come
later would exceed the vilest imagination .

” Milosz said

Milosz told of a friend who visited
Poland during the Solidarity movement
just prior to the imposition of martial law,
“In solidarity . . . for the first time [he]
was in a country without alienation,” his
friend said.

In reference to the Catholic Church in
Poland Milosz said some that do attend
church are not really believers However.
he said. they iinol church as the “only place
to tell good from evil. light from dark.
elsewhere all is blurred."
