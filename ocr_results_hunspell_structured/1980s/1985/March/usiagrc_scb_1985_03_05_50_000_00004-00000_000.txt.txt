The issue over whether or not a stop
sign should be installed at the intersecV
tion of Eighth Avenue and Park Street
has iinaily been resolved. A stop sign
will not be installed. said Russ Adams,
however. a pedestrian warning sign
will go up so that cars will be more
aware that students might be crossing
the streets.

“One reason that a pedestrian sign
will be put up instead oi a stop sign is
due to the fact that Eighth Avenue is a
vital emergency route, Adams said.
"There have only been two reports oi
accidents in the last few years."
