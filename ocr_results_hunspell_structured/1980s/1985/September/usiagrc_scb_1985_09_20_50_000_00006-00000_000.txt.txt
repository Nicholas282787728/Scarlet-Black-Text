Grinnell Mayor Dave McConnell will not
run ior reelection instead. he intends to
pursue an executive M BA degree at the
University oi iowa next year while conti-
nuing as college iood service director.

“The program is an intensive two year
commitment that along with my work and
iainily obligations will consume all oi my
iree time," McConnell said in a prepared
statement earlier this week, /

McConnell told the iieralditegister that
his decision to pursue the degree was the
only reason ior not seeking another term.
The ongoing controversy over the
Veteran’s Memorial Commission had
nothing to do with the decision,

“I think that any time somebody runs ior
public oiiice and takes stands on issues.
there will be people who have dilieriiig
v iews,” McConnell said. “I am looking ior-

been made to realize to a great extent the
defects oi the entire Japanese educational
system, not merely those oi the Japanese
college. i am not the lust person who has
pointed out the problems oi the Japanese
educational system. Many reiorm prd-
posais have already been presented,

i will not propose a reiorm drait here.
but i believe that we can get some ideas to
reiorm the Japanese educational system
by comparing it to its American counter
part. it is, at course. impossible and un-
necessary ior Japan to imitate the
American educational system in every
detail. Japan and America have big dll‘r
ici-ciices in culture. history. geography.
etc. and moreover. American education
has many problems that Japan would do
“ell to avoid, Nevertheless, change in
Japan is necessary. and we have much to
learn by studying the American system.

Japan lacks national resources. But she
has developed her present prosperity by
iostering her human resources. The iuture
oi Japan depends on its ability to alter its
educational program to suit its current
needs. Japan is ready ior its third entire
educational reiorm The best way to
reiorm the educational system is now be
in'g pursued. one which will be as
beneiicial as the iirsi educational reiorm

reiorm aiiei- the Second World War.
