Iirlnnell: 'E

Next week a series o/ articles an affirmative
action and related issue‘ will be presented.

By Rebecca Weston

The Louise Noun Chair for Women's
Studies, and the Afro-American Studies
position: just two products of Grinnell Col»
lege's Affirmative Action Program (AAPJ
that have been scrutinized by some
students and faculty in recent months. But
do most students understand the pro
gram? Before the campus students allow
themselves to pass judgment on the ad
mlnistralion's AAP. We must know what
we are judging. it is a complex program.
and before it is evaluated. it must be ex»
plained.

Strictly. the policy oi Grinnell College is
“to employ. compensate, and promote per
sons on the basis of merit and fitness.
There shall be no discrimination because
of age, race, religion. sex. sexual or affec~
Iional preference. national origin, or han-
dicap. The principal commitment is to hir-
ing those individuals deemed most likely
[0 best meet the needs of the college.” as
explained by the AAP.

However. the college acknowledges that
as an academic institution. the quality of
education is of the utmost importance,
Simply having good professors does not
necessarily “best meet the needs of the
college "

Thus. the policy continues- "Griiinell
recognizes the particular obligation or an
educational institution to be a model com
munity in which persons of all races and
bolh sexes work together. We believe that
white students. as well as minorities. male
students as well as female. need to learn to
live and work in a community in which
racial minorities as well as whites. women
as well as men. have positions of authority.
This need [or representation may
therefore appropriately become a contex-
tual consideration in determining those in-
dividuals likely to meet the needs of the
college."

Judging from iigui-es provided by the Af~
iirmative Action Comprehensive Report
tAACRl for the years 1931-1986, it is clear
that Grinnell College is not adequately
representing minorities or women, The
report shows that there are no women or
minorities at the rank of full professor. and
only 22 women and three minorities are on
the teaching faculty oi 109. Moreover, in
most positions. the number of minorities
and women employed by Grinnell College
is well below the national average. The
“progressive” goals oi the college are not
being met.

Grinnell’s AA? requires an extensive

”flow chart for faculty hiring." According
to William Deminoff, the Affirmative ACv
tion Officer who succeeded Linda
Jolinsrud. the college must “not only not
discriminate, but an active. . effort must
be made to assure that women and minorir
ty candidates are in the original [can-
didates] pool, and indeed, iii the list of
.finalists." If there arc no women or
minorities in the,pool of candidates or
finalists. the department conducting the
search must justiiy its list in speciiic
terms before Deminoti gives approval.

To guarantee this sort of pool, the col,
lege policy is to advertise available posir
tions in magazines and other sources likely
to reach minorities and women. (For ex-
ample Black Scholar.) Also, Deminoff
subscribes to the C10 Directory of Minorir
ty PM). Candidates and Recipients, a
booklet listing minorities and women who
are getting or have gotten their Ph.D,s.

Furthermore, the AAP also states that
“women and minorities are under-
represented at the most prestigious in-
stitutions, and our own ranks will continue
to reflect this historical and current
discrimination if we hold to this traditional
notion of quality."

To further address the problem of
minority representation, Quentin Johnson.
Director of Minority Affairs, is sponsoring
a “Conference on Recruitment and Reten-
tion of Black Students. Faculty. and Staff
on Predominantly White. Liberal Arts
Campuses,” September 26~28, Several col-
leges will be represented. Students will be

invited to attend major lectures and
workshops, The major lectures will be
open to the general public. More informa-
tion on the conference will be provided in
next week's issue of the Scarlet and Black.

According to Deminoff. President
George Drake is committed to the
college‘s affirmative action efforts. When
asked what Drake instructed him to ac-
complish, Deminoff said “He [Drake] put
it on the line. We have to increase the
number of women and minorities.”

Grinnell's stance raises at least two key ,
questions concerning aiiirmative action
policies in general. and the speciiic affir-
mative action policy of Grinnell. Initially,
the standard hypothetical situation is rais-
ed: What happens when two “equally
qualified” candidates are tinalists in the_
pool. and one candidate is a white male,
while the other is a black female (or
male)"

Having posed this question to Deminoff.
he said that Grinnell must “redress past
discrimination in employment or any
other aspect oi the college." Deminoti also
said that “getting into speculative discus-
sions doesn't get very tar. it is when we get
to the point oi actually recruiting“ that we
really face such problems. Deminoff did
acknowledge the diiiiculty oi the question.

Regarding the viability oi Grinnell's
AAP. the issue of "tokenism" is raised.
The college AAP recognizes that “the
number oi openings for such positions is
not large, and that a lamilyroriented small
town with no minority community may not
be Immediately attractive to minority per-
sons. lo single women. or those in two»
career families." "

Because of the environment, and the
consequent relatively fewer interested
candidates. any minority or woman who
does become attracted to and is employed
by the college will appear to be a ”token
woman or a token black." To this issue.
Deminoff responded. “We have to act as
though we are any other institution, and
though now it looks like tokenism when we
have only one black on the iaculty. there
was a time when we had five. which means
there was a consc‘ious etiort to have as
many as we can recruit who are qualified.
'l‘hat effort has to be redoubled now. . ."

The importance ol computing facilities
at Grinnell College is revealed by the fact
that over 70 percent of all students use
these facilities every week, Virtually all
students use computers in some way
before they graduate,

Tom Moberg. Director of Academic
Computing, believes that the computer is
“an education resource that can be used to
enhance the many opportunities already
available at Grinnell ” Although Com-
puter Services has no method to measure
which components oi its system gain the
most use. Moberg estimates thatword pro
cessing is the most popular function of the
computer. Moberg emphasizes the impor-
lance oi the word processor in writing 7
students spend more time writing and less
time editing, ,

The extensive use at the computer is in
keeping with one major goal oi Computer
Services, which is to give all students some
experience in the computing area,

When asked what makes Grinnell‘s com-
puter services different from those of
other academic institutions, Moberg said.
“ample access to computers (more ter-
minals and access points), better
assistance in using computers (documen-
tation and student User Consultants), and
introductory training for almost all
freshmen."

Mnberg also indicated that the number
of computer literate ireshmen entering
Grinnell each year is rapidly increasing.
He also stressed the importance of a
problem-solving background that a stu7

dent receives at like Grinnell. All these
factors contribute to the “superb coins
puting environment" that exists at Grin
nell.

The training of ireshmen on the com
puter is an aspect of the computer pro-
gram that sets Grinnell apart from the rest
of the academic computing world, Many

ireshmen this year are required to attend
two computer workshops as part oi their
tutorial training. The iirst workshop con-
sists or a large-group lecture in which the
philosophy of computing at Grinnell and
an outline oi word processing are
