After a long and tedious process or Com-
promise and discussion. the Grinnell Food
Service and the management or Grinneil
College have tentatively agieed to a con-
tract. However. beneath the smooth uns
luiroiied ground of the new contract
(leeperooted eonilicts between manage-
meiil and workers remain iirmly entrenr
clied. and. in some cases. grow stronger
with the passage oi time.

Dave McConnell, food service director
and negotiator ior management. sees little
of these conflicts “All we need to do is pro»
otread the contract We negotiated in the
mutual interest ot both parties. and i think
it's a lair and reasonable agreement." MC-
Connell stated.

But members of the [00d service union
are till unsatistied “Actually having a
say in what management gives us is one
thing." a union member lilom'Cowles dine
ing hall said. "but having that say put into
action is another."

At least three strong union members
believe that the arbiter. the person paid
by management to negotiate disputes in
the contract. was biased and did not really
understand the side at the workers, The on-
1» reason that they voted in tavor oi the
agreement was because we did not have
the guts to strike: the union member
stated.

The entire process of negotiating with
management is new to the load service
workers. Alter voting in Iavor ol unioniza-
tlon last March. the workers were ap~
pointed a representative to help represent
them and monitor management’s treat-
ment of them, Belore unionization. the
food service director consulted an
employee handbook to make out contracts
which the employees accepted with no
questions asked.

The difference alter unionization. accor-
ding to McConnell. is that there is a "more
formalized atmosphere under the union.”
McConnell does not "comprehend the
reason why anyone in the load service
would start a union" because the workers
are treated so well. Nonetheless. he
"respects their right to organize."

Members of the union shed much light on

Ila" McBonnall

what exactly sparked them to organize
last spring. Face clenched in anger. com
ments punctuated thh waves toward

children playing outside ol her home. one‘
load service worker starkly proclaimed
the concerns which led her to join the
union.

"1 want protection lrom the whims or
management I want to make sure I've got
my benetits. There was a lady wllo worked
with me who had worked there {or 20
years. and then, one day "Poor" Meson
nell deClded he did not like her. and she
was out the door."

"I don't want that to happen to me," she
exclaimed.

A worker lrom Quad dining hall. still in
workclothes. broke in. “It's just a matter
or linding the right reason. and then you're
gone. If he [McConnell] can't find some
bogus reason to tire you. then he'll harass
you until you quit,"

MeConnell's response to these accusae
thnS is that they are totally false and un-
substantiated, He states that he has terr

'minated only live people in the last nine

years. and that those Iirings were “based
on a cause. Where we dismissed based on
periormance in the past. we dismiss based
on perlormance now, The union hasn't
changed anything as tar as job security
goes."

The ‘”'we in McConliell's statements is
dillicult to deline. Although he Continued
his statement. “we try’ to review all infor-
mation available to us. including other
personnel. working areas. rid the actual
quality of the product." McConnell also
pointed out that the decision to tire a
worker is ”basically my own decision.”

The [act that McConnell sometimes
hases his decisions to tire someone on “the
word of mouth" derived from consulting
iellow employees irritates union
members

"Some people who work together don't
get along that well They can work well
and elliciently. it's just that they don't par
ticularly like each other, it an argument
should occur. and McConnell asks the girl
who was arguing what she thinks of the
other girl. he's going to get an angry

answer that doesn't take the whole Situa-
tion into account, It's damned poor
management when they rely on stool
pigeons to judge employees' perfor-
mances." the Cowles food service worker
saltl

Aside from their tears concerning job
security, which is the primary grievance
harbored by the employees. the union
members feel that McConnell tries to cut
corners and trim expenses so much that he
begins to lnlringe upon the rights oi the
workers, especially in regard to their
henelits. ,

A worker stated. “Here's a College with
more money than some small countries.
and look how despicably they're treating
their people." Union members believe that
McConnell has given them a seven and
one-halt hour workday. one-halt hour short
(ll the normal workday. so that the college
does not have to give them the benefits and
vacation time which a normal eight hour
day would accrue.

McConnell attributes this
"misunderstanding" to the fact. that "the
union people haven't done their math." He
pointed out that the college employs both
seven and one»ha’lt hour and eight hour per
day employees. based on the amount at
work the job requires McConnell
demonstrated on a calculator the [act that
the people who work seven and one-hall
hours “are getting equal benefits relative
to the amount of time they work." He add-
ed that “the benefits are on a prorated
basis." meaning that they are calculated
proportionally to the number or hours
vi orked,

This prorated basis is the cause of the
workers' complaints.

Another grievance held by the
employees is that the College does“ not give
them satisfactory raises and that the tour
percent raise negotiated under this year’s
contract is a meager sum.

"Sure it seems good it you haven‘t had a
raise for awhile.” stated one worker. “It's
like it you give some mush to a slave who
hasn‘t eaten {or days He'll appreciate it as
it it were a big yuiey steak, some ot the
people haven‘t had raises (or tour or live

years. to them. that tour percent must
seem like a million dollars" she added

McConnell responds to these charges by
claiming that only one woman \ient one
yeai without getting a raise and this lack
was due to her perlormance on the job.
Raises were based upon pertormance
previous to the contract negotiated this
year. and in the tuture raises will be inan-
natory. regardless oi perrormance,

it mllior issue in the contlict betvieen
labor and management has been the dues
tlon concerning the possible usurpation of
student jobs by the union. rhe union has
protested an attempt by McConnell to tilt
the position vacated by a retired 1D.
checker with a student instead or a worker
trom the town ol Grinnell, “He wants to
hire the student {or less and take the job
away train the town." one worker said.

McConnell stresses that the union has
tlrst priority in most tooo service jobs. ex-
cept tor the positions ol part-time checker
and dishwashers. He says that students
and locals are not competing tor jobs
because students are restricted to only
certain jobs because ol "the limitations at
their availability. skills. and primary
reason lor being in Grinnell,"

Both the management or Grinnell Food
Service and the newly Iormed workers
union are still striving tor a satislactory
compromise. Though the contract is in ex-
istence. it still must undergo rinal conﬁr-
mation by both sides,

The Griniiell Veterans Memo! ial Commission sought an
injunction against selrappninted member Mayor Dave
McConnell. during the summer because McConnell is not
a veteran. McConnell also appointed two new members to
the commission who though veterans, were conti-oveisial
chmces. The Commission saw h’lcConnell's actions as an
illegal step toward taking Control ot the Memorial
Building, where the commission meets.

Iowa Code prohibits a mayor, who is not a veteran. from
serving on such u panel unless the building in questioliis a
Coliseum, city hall, or auditorium. On July 25, District
Judge Dan Morrison ruled that the veterans' building [its
the delinition ol an auditorium and McConnell could uius
continue to serve on the board.

But MCLOnnCIl stated that the community must work
together to reach maximum utilization of city facilities
with a minimum amount of tax liability, And City Council
reports show the Memorial Building has been a steady
economic drain on the city.

At that point the veterans were considering appealing
the case to the tonal Supreme Court. Veterans brought
legal action against McConnell not becuuse oi the ques-
tionable term "auditorium." but because they were con-
cerned that McConnell and the city were trying, to tzikethc
Memorial Building away lroin them or close it complete-
ly,

"Never has it been a motive. or will it be a motive. to
have a rubbe stamp Veterans Commission, bu| ratha‘ to
utilize city resources to their fullest extent." McConnell
stated in mid-July.

Nonetheless. reliable sources concurred that Medin-
nell‘s appointmentoi Professor victor Verrette to the
commission was an eltort to sway the vote to hIS side had
he roposed to move the commission out ol the Memorial
Building McConnell's plan was to move a day care
center, in which Verette's wile works, into the building
and move the veterans out. conlidential sources told the
Scarlet and Black

Meanwhile. the Veterans Commission was dissolved
because the members had never taken an oath ol oftlce,

A new commission was torinod and McConnell stated
that as soon as b; laws were written. he would resigiihis

of developing by. \\'s
