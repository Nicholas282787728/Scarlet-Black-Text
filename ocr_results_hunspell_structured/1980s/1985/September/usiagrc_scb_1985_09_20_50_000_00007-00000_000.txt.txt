VIII! can't beat a 0138810

1 can see James Dean struggling to get
through Monday. I can’t see Rob Lowe
struggling to get through Monday, or
anything else icr that matter.

1 can identiiy with him. though perhaps
not as well as my ISsyear-old cousin, who
can be Just as surly as unresponsive as any
character in Rebel Without a Cause. Some
teenage guys like Dean because he
glamorizes their alienation, they are not
the only ones who feel like they don't
belong.

Dean may hold thc same appeal loi-
some girls. but the ones I've talked to seem
to have a more maternalistlc (or
animalisticl interest in him. “He makes
you ieel sorry lor him." said one
freshman, “and who Can't identify with
feeling misunderstood?“ One sophomore
who has a lite»slze poster of Dean over her
bed said. “It's lust. Pure and simple,"

But Dean never had really “grabbed"
me until I saw him three years ago in
Giant. a painiully long. glossy. huge iilm
that ran almost four hours. It starred
Elizabeth Taylor. Rock Hudson and Dean
and chronicled the lives 01 three wealthy

Texans (Hudson inheriting his money and
taking eastern bred and born Taylor as his
wiiet and Dean as the loner cowboy who
strikes “black gold.”

The movie was only mediocre ~ the plot
was contrived and oiten pointless, and
Liz'S hair (once again) was never mussed.
But in the first half 01' the Iilm. Dean's
presence was like a Jolt of lightening. His
restlessness and his Intensity wcrc
palpable, He made the first two hours
almost interesting. And when [saw Rebel
Without a Caiisc again. I enjoyed his per-
lormance more than I did the first time.

Because he made only three movies, we
will never really know how much range
Dean really had. Could he have utilized his
talents in roles where he wasn‘t
misunderstood. angry. or leit out? One
could argue that he might have been cast
in similar roles in different movies time
after time if he had lived But I believe he
uould have grown as an actor. and cons
liiiued to bring a high degree oi
humaneness to his work.

irish strangers
The irish Protestant population. simply
called irish or Scotchrirish to diiierentiate
irom Irish Catholics, settled largely in the
south and rural parts oi the southeast, in»
cluding Appalachia lrish Catholics. on the
other hand. tended to concentrate in the
large cities oi the northeastern part ol the
country and to become much more visible
than did their Protestant counterparts,

This 30minute drama deals entirely with
the Irish Catholic immigrants who Came
alter 1820. and. especially after the Irish
[amines of the late 1300': They. like their
Jewish counterparts. suffered religious
persecution and faced the problems of all
immigrants oi that period. Intense eom~
muiiity pride. loyalty to the Catholic
church, and a search tor respectability
and acceptance became key elements in
the Il‘ishrAmerlcan culture and the Irish
continue to he the most politically active
ethnic group in America,

The Last Ilurrali

Director John Ford's iilms. taken
together. provide a panorama oi the
development of America. The Last Hurrah
depicts an important part or this develop-
ment. dealing, as it does. with integration
in America, specilically integration or
irish Catholics. Although they came
earlier and have been more successtul
than other Catholic immigrant groups.
they have always retained a distinctive, it
mostly unconscious, irish-American
perspective, which, coupled with political
skills helped them to achieve political
power in American cities and to begin the
climb to occupational. educational, and
economic stability.

The Last llui'i'nli. said to be based on the
career oi Mayor Jamcs Curlcy oi Boston.
shows the old-time irish political system iii
action. Spencer Tracy in probably one oi
his best rolcs. plays a politician who holds
power through shrewdness and close idenr
tiiication with his constituents. Tracy is
supported by a host oi co-slars. including
Pat O'Brien. Basil Rathborte. Donald Crisp
and John Carradiiic, Thc sci-ipct. based on
a novel by Edwin O'Connor. reminds us
that irish writers havc made and continue
to make important contributions to
