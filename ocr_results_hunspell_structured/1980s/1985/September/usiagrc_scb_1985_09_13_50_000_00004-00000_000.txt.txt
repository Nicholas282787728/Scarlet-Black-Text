. marks the occasion oiyet another-
inipo ant date in the lite ota Grinnell stu-
tlcnt: the deadline ior changing a class
lrom grading A-F to puss/tail. '

Presumably, the pass/tail option is
given so that students who would like to
take a course iorcredit. but would alsolike
to feel a little less “grade point pressure"
may do so.

For students who register tor a course
with the decision to be graded pass/tail
clearly in mind, there is no problem.
llowever. many students are not so in-
stantly decisive. and would like to receive
a little feedback on their coursework prior
to making their decision. A little time to
consider the decision might be nice too.

For these students. an unpleasant sur-
prise awaits.

The pass/rail deadline has somehow
been ludicrously placed. probably due to
an uiilortuiiate error, a paltry i2 class
days after school begins. For a typical
Monday, Wednesday. Friday course. this
means that the class has met seven times.

Seven times.

T k about .

llovt many protessors do you know who
will be able to provide ieedback on course
work within seven days? 0.K strauber,
but who else" ‘

Quite ob ously something has to be
done. If Gr nell students are to make ra-
tional, well thought out decisions, they
need two very important items: time and
intoriiiat' n. Due to some bizarre and
surel, unintentional mix-up, they are be-
ing denied both ot these elements.

Perhaps there is some logical reasoning
behind the senseless timing oithe pass/rail
deadline.

I can‘t think ot one. though.

lo the Btlllltl':

The September 6 issue of the S 5: B cons
tained an article entitled “Too Many

Freshmen, Again”. The article contains
inaccuracies as well as points that need
clarification. First. a minor point. The ar-
ticle refers to me as Director of Student Af-
fairs; my title is Assistant Dean of Student
Affairs and Director of Student Housing.
Second, the article mentions the “attrition
rate for seniors" as totaling 20-25 students.
The attrition rate of 20-25 students is the
normal attrition from the Committee on
Academic Standing for all upperclass
students-sophomores, juniors, as well as
seniors. Also. the reasons for attrition go
beyond dismissals and suspensions. Ins
eluded are academic leaves, medical
leaves, personal leavesv and withdrawals.
Third. the article mentions that Admis-
sions was asked to bring in “370 to 375
students”, Admissions was asked to bring
in 370 to 375 freshmen. not total students.
The total new student goal ttreshmen and
transfers) was set at 405. The ﬁnal new
student enrollment is 421: 403 freshmen, 15
transfers, and 3 readmits: Fourth. the arti-
cle paraphrases me as saying the admis-
sions policy was ”outdated". Although i
am unhappy with this policy as it has con-
tributed to overcrowding this fall. I did not
reler to this policy as “outdated".

In trying to explain why Grinnell had
more than 370-375 freshmen, l explained
that the admissions policy assumes a cer-
tain percentage of prospective students
will accept offers of admission. As the
percentage or acceptances is based on
statistical projections, the projections can
be off. And, as occurred this fall. more
students accepted admission offers than
projected; thus overcrowding.

The article was accurate in describing
my guess 'as to why more students ac-
cepted admission to Grinnell: widespread
publlcily about Grinnell’s endowment had
brought attention to Grinnell and its
academic programs. Also, the article was
accurate in describing my longvterm ape
proach in dealing with overcrowding, This
approach was to lobby President Drake.
Vice President Walker. and Director of
Admissions Hopkins for a waiting list

To those less fortunate than I (and in thls
place there are many), 1 dedicate this arttr
cle, I am from the midwest; i am from
lowa. and unless you also are lrom iowa.
or perhaps Illinois, 1 highly doubt you have
been exposed to the strangeness and
remoteness of the corn grower's ex
perience: detasseling. To you, i will tell
my story.

Detasseling took me. almost literally, in-

strategy that would give the college more
Control of numbers, Here I noted there are
pros and cons to a waiting list strategy
and that the Admissions staff could resist a
waiting list strategy because of the
“uncertainty" it creates for some prospecs
tive students Applicants would certainly
not like to be left “in limbo" in the late spr-
ing of their Senior year. At no time was it
said the Admissions Office ”refused" to
create a waiting list.

Another concern was the manner in
which the information was gathered for
the article. The information about over-
crowding was disclosed in a conversation
with four students while discussmg their
specific overcrowded situation and possi-
ble ways to help them, At no time did a stu
dent identify herselr as an s at B reporter.
or mention an article was being written in
which i would be quoted or paraphrased,
and at no time were notes taken. it may be
helpful in the future if students identify
themselves while in the role of a student
reporter. intorm an individual they are be-
ing interviewed for an article. and take
notes of statements to be attributed to that
individual.

A last concern is with the editing process
used for this article The reporter informs
ed me that her original article was edited
so that the wording and tone in certain
places were markedly changed. i believe
the original intent of the article was
positive - to inform the community of the
causes. effects and responses to the over-
crowding problem, it seems that
somewhere in the process this intent was
lost, — But! Towner-Lal'sell

am compelled to respond.

First, the entire front page patently
lacked objectivity. The choice of that plCr

accompanying articles, particularly Mr.
Glueck‘s on the food service union, were
clearly written to convince the reader that
Mr. McConnell is mean-spirited and will»
ing to ride roughshod over anyone who
crosses him (especially working mothers
and war heroes). An objective article
would have presented the facts about the
union contract (what are the provisions
regarding allocations of specitic duties to
townspeople or to students, grievance pro
cedures, reasons in firing, etc), past
practices (who was actually fired and for
what stated reasons) and so forth, and

couple hundred bucks for “spending
money.” most of the tield hands going out
to work in the crops were adults earning a
couple hundred bucks lcr their sustenance.

The image became even more vivid as
we got into the very old. mudrcolored bus
and drove to the held in the ever increas
ing heat and rising sun. The bus broke
down more than once berore we reached
our designation. On the highway, sitting
beside the steaming bus, we, the iield
hands, were given instructions ina confus-
ed mixture or Pharsi and English ~ an
especial problem tor Orlando. the

Nicaraguan who just arrived in the United
States two months ago, and Uche. the
Nigerian who fought in his country's Civil
war at age thirteen

When the bus was moving. we all sat
quietly. either choosing to be or feeling
forced into our separate worlds. mentally
preparing ourselves tor the work that took
us into fields as tall as our heads and Into
heat that burned our faces,

The fantasy broke. however, when l was
struck by two luxuries. Unlike the vast ma
jority of the world's true migrantworkers,
our crew was able to buy gloves to protect
our hands from blisters and corn rash.
Also. we could buy big roast beef or
chicken sandwiches. complete with
mayonnaise. a sesame seed bun, potato
chips. and a huge diet Coke. i knew men
that i wasn't a field worker in lran trying
to earn money for my family. but i was
and am a lucky college student in the
United States trying to earn her activities

As amazing as the people around me
were. the real. though contextually
limited. bonds were established between
all the people affiliated with the L‘letassel-
ing: workers and employers alike. Though
I was one of the “weekenders,” in the short
time that I worked. I noticed in myself and
in the others that a real level of friendship
was built on the intense common ex-
perience of working 15 hours at manual
labor in the hot sun,

The first day at lunch. people sat alone

However. after a day. people sat in
groups. saved each other places on the
bus. knew people's names, whether or not
David or Birgit was from Iowa. and
whether David enjoyed acting and Birgit
wanted to be a doctor. Conversations were
longer, more selective. less superficial.
Most heartening was that after a week oi
