but “to identity black students with special
needs and to sensitize the Grinnell College

community to cultural diiicrences thatr

minorities bring to campus." Johnson
stated. Moreover. according to Johnson.
the OMA aims to generate communication
at all levels, ultimately to Create a
homogeneous campus

Also. the OMA provides Varlous cultural
activities in ordzr to correct mlsconccp-
tinns about ethnic (inferences. According
to Johnson, most black studenls are ac-
customcd to the tact that they Wlll pro
llahly work W|th white people. while it is
less usual for white students to realize that
they will eventually work with black pear
ple Johnson cxplalncd that it "isn‘t
always a luck at desire. but a [car and lgr
noi‘ance of cultural dillcl‘qnccs" lhal
cause stress and racial segregation.

Johnson identiiied several racial pro-
blems still eveldelll Ill the Grinnell com-
munity: “black students are stored at
when they go downtown. and into store ..
Most students at Grinnell do not Hndel’E
tand the philosophy oi the Black Cultural
Center. why black students collectively Cat
together, or why many black students talk
'black engllsh' in essence. they do not
have a SOUND understanding Oi black
culture in a positivc sense "

Tllel‘elm'e. “it is important that all
students trom all backgrounds and races
hi '0 an opportunity to live, learn. work
and relax together on Griniiells campus
Students [must understand that] everyone
can live. work. run a government. and
relax in harmony We hope that these
positive collegiate experiences will tunnel
back into the real world." Johnson said.

When compared to most campuses.
Grinnell seems to be unique According to
Johnson,- it is easy to Identity blatant
separatist policies on other campuses.

Johnson cited “separate dorms tor blacks
and other minorities and constant conllicts
hetween black students and ad~
lnlnistralors " lie contlnued to say that
“much that is going on at Grinnell is taken
tor granted. but just does not happen on
other campuses "

And there is a lot going on at Grinnell in
addition to the OMA, there is the Black
Cultural Center iBCCt‘ where “black
students are able to collectivcly talk about
spccitic needs that are unique to black
students. [The BCC attempts to] des
cinphosizc and tleseiisitizc the isolation

'l'hcrc is also the Concerned Black
Stutlellls Organization lCBSO). that can
call and meet with President George
Drake at any timc, Johnson said.

Furthermore. the Black Student Task
Force lBS'l‘Fl identities hoth negativc and
positive aspects oi “the collcgc communi-
ty us it is related to the black students ex-
pcl'icnce." Said Johnson. Bciore
November l. [he BS’i‘F plans to send a
survey through the computer terminals
that will measure campus attitudes and
isolate areas or student concern

Yet. there is a danger “that results lrom
a hlack student coming ironi a large.
mell'opolllan, urhan environmeutt and hits
ding onescli living with white students.
[living inl a culture and according to
values that are so vastly diitcrcnt from
those in the cities." said Johnson, He calls
tinned. saying. “black students are in
danger oi losing the identities that they've
grown up with,"

Johnson explained that "when going
hack home lrom time to timp maov

students soon reel they are no longer part
at that environment because they can no
longer relate in a cultural or social level A
lot or times. [students separatc
themselves] from lamllles and friends
lcausmgl damage that is Irreversible.”

Furthermore. “there is a small percen-
tage ot black students that totally immerse
themselves in the white community. and
do not have the need to interact with other
black students." according to Johnson.
These people are per civcd by othcr black
students as having "committed a serious
Ullcllsc." Johnson sultl.

Johnson explained that “in the 1960's.
during thc civil rights movcnicnt. black
pcoplc worked \ei‘y hard to gain equality,
Black people. asa race. are tired oi having
our race still living in povcrty in the
1980 . Many sec education as a tool to an

Thus. "it is culturally important that

Johnson said,

The tunetioii ot' the rious black student
related programs is to alleviate that
pressure. uhile helping to maintain black
cultural identity. Johnson said. "My goal
here is to see lllal black students 'see
themselves as part at the campus. grow
and learn as indlvlduills. strive to excel ,
zluldcmically. retain those cultural values
that are important. while being open to
learning nevi ideas and non values that

and an improved quality oi Iile ior all."
