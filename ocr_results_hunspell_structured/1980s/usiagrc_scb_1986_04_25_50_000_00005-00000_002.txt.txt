GRINNELL, iowa (YGSWJ 7 Today
started out as an ordinary day ior this
reporter aylhe famed Mid-West College.
Little did 1 know that by the end oi the day
the entire infrastructure of this esteemed
institution would undergo What amounts to
complete revolution.

Life was going on as normal prepara-
tions were underway in the annual beer
bust. euphemistically called Relays This
was to be the Fourteenth year oi this
celebration.

This years' celebration preparations had
been iniused with a special sense oi urgen-
cy. Rumors abounded that this was to be
the last oi these iestivities. The drinking
age is to rise and the creative powers that
be see this as an insurmountable problem
ior iuture celebrations.

Despite the iatalistic air Relays Four-
teen was oil to an amazing start. Money
was raised with relative ease, teeshiru
sold like hot cakes. the buttons were an in-
stant success and beer became a beverage
not a projectile.

However this was not enough This
reporter was shocked by what transpired
at this evening’s meeting oi .ioint Board.
As Susannah Richards, our esteemed
beloved leader moved to close the meeting
the doors oi the Chamber burst open ad-
mitting what we now know to be our UBCR
Secret Police. They raced to the podium
and physically deposed the President.
Susannah in this time oi frenzy showed
remarkable iortitude stripping on ,her
Carleton College sweatshirt revealing a
Relays Xiv tee-shirt.

A rally cry went up through the
Chamber from the strategically placed
revolutionaries, “Secession! Secession!
Long Live UBCRl Long Live UBCRl " Sud-
denly the hallowed ARH ll stilled as H.
Wayne Moyer entered accompanied by an
armed bodyguard. An air oi reverence
pervaded as he regally advanced to the
podium.

Chaos ensued as rhythmic chanting
broke the silence Slowly l-i Wayne Moyer

Lacking the heort /or it myself, i usually give
the job to our unfortunate copy editor, who
dutifully turns out a terse piece each week
reminiscent of the Newton Daily News' school
board report.

1 should have suspected something else was
going on.

the sacred neynolds Aluminum crown
upon his head and proclaimed: “We crown
thee Grand Pooh Pah tor Life! in the name
oi Relays Future‘ " Loud cheers, whistles
and cries oi jubilialion filled the air

The Grand Pah motioned ior silence and
there was silence. He announced tor all to
hear in his stenlorian tones that the dic-

tator Susannah‘-had been deposed and a .
new nationrslate. The United Beer Cons ,

Suming Republic, had been formed. He
elaborated further stating the UBCR did
not recognize the sovereignty oi either the
State of Iowa or the United Slates it was an
entity in and of itself, Griiinell had seceded
from the union, The laws were the laws of
UBCR, the government oi an elite corps oi
handpicked advisers The Grand Pooh-
Pah for Life lGPPL) then read the UBCR
constitution (See Constitution printed in
this issuel and proclaimed a national

greeted with resounding cheers,

The Grand Pooh Pah was followed by the
newly appointed Prime Minister Barbara
Cardell, Ms Cardell took the stand amid a
ilurry oi enthusiastic applause. The new
Prime Minister announced that the UBCR
had seized control of the media and an-
nouncements were now ilooding the newly
formed State as to the secesston and (Orr
mation. This announcement was greeted
by a small gasp irom the recently deposed
government. and someone gasped
“freedom of the press!” To whichrMs.
Cardell turned upon the opposition “Who
said it wasn't guaranteed? Have you not
listened to our revered Grand Pooh
Pahi l “ The oiiender was quickly placated
by the Minister oi internal Security and
head of the Secret Police Nick Wright.

News of the Secession flew fast [Iver the
dark green lawns of the new Republic.
North Campus broke out into rioting
claiming it had a paper due and now was
not the time for political action. Other
areas met the news with trepidation, fear»
ing a counter-coup by the Academia or
Hangover factions, The general consensus
in the Forum was of confusion A mass ex»

planning had gone into the coup.

Once at the Pub the air of hysteria and
expectation prevailed it was it the crowd
instinctively knew something was aioot.
When I questioned the nubile young
woman next to me, she replied, “Gee, like
I thought this was ya‘ know like planned."
She apparently was uniniormed oi the

At the Pub the Grand Pooh Pah was res
crowned amid a roar oi public approval.

The Crowning was followed by a careful-
ly executed celebration. Liberal libations
occurred, even opposition conservatives
participated. The atmosphere was one of
bewildered joy. Suddenly attention was
called, the New Minister of State, Tor
Plough. called out. “Go forth and be hap-
py! We are free at last: thank the Pooh

dreaded Drakeness! Free from [he tyranr

occasional speeches and proclamations
were made, On the whole, once the UBCR,
showed no signs oi using iorce the mood oi

As the dawn creeps upon this new
Republic nothing appears to have chang

however radical change is taking place

The first large public rally in celebration
