A question arises

Although there are not many issues which are of concern to
the entire student body of Grinnell, such an issue does occa-
sionally arise on this campus. The recent controversy over the
shifting of emphasis on athletics is one example. The proposed
closing of the Health Center is another one.

If the Health Center is closed, the effects on the student body
as a whole will be mixed and the effects on individual students
will depend mainly on each student’s needs and desires.
However, the precise effects are difficult to determine, because
at the present time no one knows exactly what the change would
entail. What is known of the situation is described in the article
on page three, and some student reactions are given in the col-
umn on page 12 and the letter on page 15.

We urge others, administrators as well as students, to con—
tribute their thoughts on this subject. A question with such
potentially great effects deserves serious consideration in the
public forum before any decision is made.
