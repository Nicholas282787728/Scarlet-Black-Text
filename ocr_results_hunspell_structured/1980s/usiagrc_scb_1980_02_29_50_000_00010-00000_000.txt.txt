J.D.’s Restaurant
and Lounge

by Lesley Williams

So you’ve gotten up he nerve to
take that “special someone” out to
dinner and you want to make a good

. impression. You have no vehicular
transportation, 50 torget B.J.’s and all
the out or town spots, What are the
alternatives? The Longhorn? Pizza
Hut? You shudder with horror. ”Is
there the equivalent of a nice
restaurant in Grinnell, Iowa?" you

. moan.

Despair not! There is an answer:

J .‘s Restaurant and Lounge. Conve-
niently located across from the Grin-
hell Cinema on Main StreetI J.D,’s is
about the closest one can come to fans
cy eating within the city limits.

Finding J.D.’s may take some do-
ing. Turning oit Highway 6 and advanr
cing about a block and a hall up Main
Street, you'll see the JD. logo, dwari-
ed by a huge Sears sign, Beneath the
signs are two narruw glass doors: be
careful which one you choose or you’ll
end up in Hamman's Apparel Shop.
Backing up a bit you lind it; a trosted
glass bearing the words, ”J.D.’s
Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge.” The
door opens and you see...stairs, disap-
pearing into darkness above. Curiosity
mounting along with your feet, you ar-
rive at the top of a dimly lit landing.
Congratulations! You are in J.D,'s.

,Once inside you have your choice of
two rooms: the restaurant proper and

‘ - the cocktail lounge. it really makes
little diiterence which you pick, as the
same food and drinks can be ordered
in either section. I prefer the lounge
for atmosphere. Lit only by a low col»
ored lights around the periphery, it
carries a irontier motii, Wagon wheels
lean against walls which resemble the

' inside of a log cabin; while framed
copies of newspapers hearing such
headlines as “Lee Surrenders"
abound, There’s even a large mural
depicting pioneers crossing the great
' plains.

Fortunately, die motii goes no fur-
ther. The waiters do not step forward
in leather breaches and 10 gallon hats,
nor is the menu riddled with such cute
items as ”Bronco Bustin' Beelburger”
or “Frontier Fries." Dignity and
decorum are the key words. Your
waiter, clad in distinguished black
vest and pants, will escort you to the
booth of your choice. Menus are
distributed, and the orders taken as
soft muzak plays in the background.

You may want to order a cocktail
helore‘ your meal, J.D.'s bar is well»
equipped to handle any request. My
personal tavorite, Tequila Sunrise,
contained just the right mixture of in»
gredients, at a price comparable to
that at similar establishments. if you
enjoy wine with dinner you will not be

’10

disappointed, as the red and white
choices are both quite appetizing. For
those at you who preicr the taste of
hops, J.D.’s carries an extensive
selection of beers, both imported and
domestic.

Alas, man does not live by alcohol
alone, much as he would like, l-iencc,
with whetted appetite, you scan the
menu. Emphasis is obviously placed
on steak, with six varieties to Choose
from, The Delmonico is a popular
item, coming in both a and 12 oz. Serv-
ings, Filet Mignon is a good choice as
well. Prices tor the above two itcms
run from $3.95 for smaller portions to
$13.75 for thc 12 oz. sizes. th worry
not. those of you with thinnci‘ wallets,
A good sirloin is available for $8.95; or
you might consider the Beef-Kabobs
or J.D.’s Special 6 01, Steak for only
36.95 each. In all cases the meat
comes well seasoned and juicy. I
usually order wellrdone as their con-
ception at “medium” is a bit raw {or
my tastes, but this may be a personal
idiosyncrasy.

it, however, you are not in the mood
for stcak, thcrc are several excellent
and reasonably priced alternatives.
The seafood assortment is tantalizing:
scallops, ocean perch, tried oysters,
shrimp and claims, These items range
from about $6 to $7. Other selections
include iried chicken, harn steak,
pork, lamb chops. and spaghetti. T ii
there is the house special, that intrigu-
ing and exotic dish, Eluoin Shrdlu. l
won't tell you what it is exactly, but
believe me, the taste is indescribable.

All of these dinners come with a
green salad and your choice oi hakcd
or Irenclirfricd potatoes. The salads
are not particularly exciting, but
palatable, and the dressings are tasty.
In any case, should you desire a
lighter meal, try a sandwich. Besides
the usual hamburgers and grillcd
cheese. J.D.'s offers poi-ch, pork
tenderloin, chicken, and steak sands
wiches, average price being about
$1.90

By the time you have disposed oi a

JD. Steak, salad, and potato dinner,
you probably won‘t have room [or
anything else. Yet tor those curious
souls among you, here is the dessert
selection: icc crcam, (yes! real, hard
ice cream!) pecan pie, and a charm
ing little dish called Chocolate Tues
day, designed lor thosc of you who
vowed, “Never a Sundae!" Nothing
spectacular, but a pleasant way to
round utt your meal. ,

The Bar

by Chris Barry

The Bar is Gi'inncll's ‘othcr' bar.
Unlike the Longhorn, they don’t scrve
food, This might be an advantage in
the long run; one of the ﬁrst things
you notice is the abscncc of the “forty
and over, out with the wife for a night
on the town" crowd. People at The
Bar are there to have a good time,
and the management is glad to oblige.
'l'wo rcccntly instituted specials in-
clude the “DoublerBubblc” and the
$1 25 pitcher, The “Doublc~Bubble" is
two drinks tor the price or one, every
Monday, Wednesday. and Saturday,
from 4:30 to 6:30. You can get the
$1.25 pitcher a days a week.

Mixed drinks are reputed to be less
potent than the Lunghorn's, but the
prices are somcwhat lower. A typical
mixed drink runs about $1.00, with
some oi the more expensive ones be
ing $1 8!) or 50. All domestic beer is on
tap. Pabst Blue Ribbon, Bud. and
Miller are all 50 cents a draw: Special
Export is 60 cents. A bottle of
Heineken is a dollar.

There are two pool tables at one end
and a jukc box at the other. OCCa~
sional live hands provide more in-
lcl‘csting entertainment, but for the
most part it is an cntcl'tain yours-ell
operation.

Th1.- Bal‘ is located in a basement
right next to the Sears outlct on Main
Street. You can also got in through the
alley in the hack.
