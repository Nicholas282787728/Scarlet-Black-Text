In order to raise the additional
needed iunds. the women‘s center
has approached Grinnell College

more detailed iniormation on the
budget breakdown, The board
members or the center. along with
Dale Haivn. the director of the col-
lege physical plant and general
contractor and designer oi the
center. are meeting to discuss the
budget in order to resubmit their
proposal to the college.

Once lt begins. the center plans
to otter a variety or programs to
the community and campus Ana

ticipaieu programs include
women's history and women‘s
writing; career-related programs,
legal aspects lor women. such as
equal pay and parental leave:

on a college campus. The center
will cater to all age groups, and
though it is basically geared
towards women. men are also
welcome.

in Europe. But by September. the
iniormation was readily available
to decision-makers and the general
public....The sad fact was the
Roosevelt administration was even
more reluctant to act than the
British administration. The US.
government acknowledged the
idea of the extermination cams
paign, Despite that, the State
Department was to actively block
all activity that might be designed
to help Jews in Europe. But enough
inlormation was made public that
when a Gallup poll taken in
January '43 asked. ‘It is estimated
that two million Jews have been
killed since the war began. Do you
think this is true or just a rumor?,
47% responded, 'yes lit is true].' "

, For 18 months the U.S did
nothing...absolutely nothing. We
actively tried to locus people's at-
tention elsewhere, Officially. Winnr
ing the war was the best way to
help the chs, in reality, the State
Department's policy was keep the
issue out ol public locus. avoid
rescue eiiorts. support the British
policy on Palestine, and avoid
massive Jewish immigration to the
U, "

ome ol the most spectacular
rescue efforts made in the latter
part at the war were engineered by
Sweden. Certainly those of us who
believe in democracy. in this par-
ticular case. [believe] a
democracy responded in a positive
way Unlortunately, that’s not the
case ,,,In August and September
[1942] very thorough knowledge
was available in Stockholm among
the chief decisionrmakers. . ,From
November, 1942. until the end of
the war. Sweden did engagc in
various activities to help Jews.
some successful...some unsucV
cessiul. How do i explain the
dynamics of their policies? I wish 1
could say that it's because the
Swedes really valued den'locracy
and they were serious about
humanitarian rights ,but i don‘t
think that's the case Unfortunate-
ly. I think the evidence is Over
\i'helming that the real reason that
the Swedes became active after
1942 was because they recognized
that Germany was going to lose the
war and that they needed to have
good will with the Western powers
it is intcrestnig that the Swedish
government never initiated any ei-
fOrts to help the Jews The initials

tion always came lrom outside the
government and generally lrom
outside the country. There are no
exceptions."

. i think that the real issue
here is not policies that would have
taken real resources. The most im-
portant thing was inlormation to
the Jewish people ol Europe. We
had plenty oi evidence that when
Jews iully and clearly appreciated
what was going on. then their
behavior was iar less predictable
than it was when t didn't have
any sense or surety '

years at medical school, he went to
Bolivia for five weeks to work in a

Aware that one at the major con-
tributing factors to the high infant
mortality rate in thirdrworld coun-
ties ”is ignorance as opposed to
lack of food stuff." Sandler sought
to prevent malnutrition by working
with newborns and their mothers.

“We would see newborns every
month until the lirst year of age,
We would weigh them, take a blood
count, and then every month we
would add a toad supplement.

"Their diet consists of breast
milk up until the age old or 5 years.
then coltee and bread. There was
ample fruit v we were in the
tropics e and \vc would add juice.
then grains, and ultimately protein
in the lorm oi meats by the time
they were one year. So they had
complete well-balanced meals. We
would also educate the mother."

he “derived a great deal at
pleasure."

He actively tries to recruit
players ior Grinnell. ”1 do a lair
amount oi sports medicine in my
practice,” he said, ”I'm always
looking lor potential athletes, and
especially iootball players, but it's
oiliicult to get them to come here
ito Grinnelll "

Besides the lack ol appeal that
iowa's climate holds lor Arizona
residents. he leels Grinnell has not
done enough to attract the Scholarr
athlete, at least as tar as iootball is
concerned. "I think that a school
like Grinnell that states it's an
outstanding liberal-arts education
would want to be outstanding in
every field ol endeavor that we
participate in, whether on the
athletic iield or in thc classroom or
on stage.

"We should strive ior excellence
in iootball Just like in any other
ltieldl.” Sandler declared. “And
we can do that, i believe. We can
get quality iootball players that
are bright, who do not detract trom

our academic standing. But we
have to make iliat a priority, And
we should show favoritism to those

that the lack ol campus support lor

He remembered an incident that

occurred after he had convinced an
"outstanding athlete iwho is] now
