Doorway to Grinnell‘s past

by Bill Warburton
The Grinnell Historical
Museum at 1125 Broad street is a
treasure chest of knowledge and
antique objects. Not very many
people know that it exists, but
it’s close to campus, lying two
houses north of the Smith
Funeral Home. Some students
pass by the beige-andagreen house
on their way to or from town. yet
few stop to visit. The casual
visitor is discouraged from
visiting the museum due to its
limited hours. It's only open on
Fridays from 2 p.m. to 4 pm.
Every time I‘ve passed by the
museum in the past three years it
was closed, until last Friday. I
entered the museum and found
myself immersed in the armo-
spherc of a day gone by,
Antiques, representing the
lifestyles of Grinnellians in
earlier times, ﬁll the house from

wall to wall. Along with the
expected, run~of~the~mill pieces,
such as chairs. beds. and old
clothes. are a bevy of interesting
items, which include the leather
football helmet of a Grinnell
high-school student in the 19205,
1,13. Grinnell's huge and elabomte
desk, a hand-pump dishwasher.
and war memorabilia dating back
to the Civil War.

The museum is chock full of
information as well. Everything
one would ever want to know
about the town is within their
vast ﬁles. and likely captured in
photos as well. How many
college students would ever guess
that this tiny town in the middle
of Farmland USA was once a
center for heavy industry? The
Spaulding Automotive Company
manufactured cars here for a few
years in the early 19005 at a

factory on Fourth Street. not far
from the Eagles’ Club. In
addition. there was a washing-
machine company in town which
manufactured machines from the
turn of the century well into the
1930s Images of belching
smokestacks dominating the
Grinnell skyline are difficult to
conjure.

A visit to the Grinnell
Historical Museum is certainly
well worth the effort and time. It
doesn’t cost any money and
there’s always someone there to
give you a tour on Fridays from
2 erL to 4 pm. Plan to go
today. or plan ahead for next
Friday. If you decide to visit the
museum the next time you pass
by when it happens to be open, it
might be three years before you
step through its doors.

Women's rights in

by May-lee Chai

One cold day last December I
went to interview representatives
of the Nanjing City Women‘s
Federation. 1 was very excited
because the Women’s Federation
is one of the sole means Chinese
women have to combat
discrimination in the work place,
The Federation additionally helps
battered wives. offers nanny»lo-
eating services, and promotes the
One’Child Family Planning Pro
gram.

1 was also a little more than
nervous as the interview had to
be conducted entirely in Chinese.

Armed with my notebook full
of painfully translated questions
and a letter of introduction from
Nanjing University, I arrived at
the large brick and concrete-block
complex that housed the city
associations, including the
Federation.

I climbed over the piles of
dirt, trash, and rubble in the
entryway and began asking
directions of all those around. I
was eventually steered up a
narrow ﬂight of stairs and past
felt—curtained doors to a back
room labeled with a small
wooden sign.

I knocked and entered.

My arrival sent the office into
panic. Three women jumped up
from their desks and rushed
towards me. One grabbed my

letter of introduction.

“Oh, she's a foreigner. A
foreign student." she said,

My letter disappeared into a
back office and I was told to sit
and wait As the minutes ticked
by. I observed the remaining four
office workers read the movie
schedules in the paper aloud and
energetically stamp large yellow
posters that praised Jia ting wen
ming (families that were suc-
cessfully implementing the one-
child policy).

I stared at the yellow stove in
the middle of the room. Two
coal briquettes were piled before
it. A bent aluminum pipe from

the stove was suspended rather
unsteadily across the room, It
passed through a hole in the
broken glass window Cold air
rushed in from the hole,
effectively annihilating any heat
tlte stove managed to throw out.
A half hour passed and I felt I
had been completely forgotten.
Suddenly a back door opened and
two women approached me,
saying they had not prepared for
my visit but I could ask anything

China

I wanted and they would try to
answerl

“The Women’s Federation
protects the rights of women." I
began, “Howi" '

“The Federation protects the
rights at women. Our
government says women and men
are equal, This is the law. The
government guarantees fivc
rights Equal rights with men in
politics, economics, cultural.
social, and family life."

“ch," I said. “How does the
Federation protect these rights? I
have heard there is much
discrimination. For example,
many factories don’t want to hire
women."

“Yes," one of the women
said. “Some factories don‘t want
to hire women. They prefer
men." They nodded at me.

“OK. Um, if a woman
comes to you and says a factory
refused to hire her because she is
a woman, what does the
Federation do to help her?"

”The Federation talks to the
factory and if they have a good
reasonithe work is too hard

physically. it’s unsuitable for
women, etc—then OK. "
"But if it’s work women
ooulddo?"
“Then they must hire
women"

“But if they don’t want to.
what does the Women’s
Fedemtion do?" I asked.

There was
uncomprehending silence.

I knew that some companies
simply refused to accept any
women assigned to them by the
government. Others. when
recruiting college graduates,
refuse to consider any of the
women, only their male
counterparts, It is a major
problem. On the average, 61.5
percent of the unemployed youth
in China are female.

I rephrased my question and
gestured to the characters written
in my notebook. “Ifa factory in

an

Nanjing refuses to accept women,
what does .the Women’s
Federation do? "

“We protect the ﬁve rights of
women: political. economic.
social—“

“OK. All right. " I decided
to move on I asked them about
a recent development in the
working scene: an extended
matemity leave through which
women could leave their jobs
from six months to three years at
about 70 percent of their base
salary. I had read that in some
instances women were forced to
take the leave after they became
pregnant whether they wanted it
or not.

“Most women like the
extended leave, " one of the
women said. “They do not get as
much money as they did when
