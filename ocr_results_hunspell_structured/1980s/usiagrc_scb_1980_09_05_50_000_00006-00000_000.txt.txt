Dorm facelifts draw comments, criticisms

by Sydney Henlhom

in the fall of 1977, the first renovation
improvements on Grinnelljs on-campus
student housing began, Clark Hall was
the lirst building to be renovated,

followed by Main, James, Langan,v

Smith, and now Cleveland. Norris also
belongs to this list of renovated
buildings, but it was never closed com-
pletely when construction began on the
addition of the fourth floor.

There has been a variety of reactions
to these improvements by both old and
new students. but tor the most part
Grinnell dorm life has remained the
same. On a typical afternoon, one can

still observe the basic college activities ,

that Grinnell attracts: people listening
to loud stereos, people studying in the
lounges, basketball in the hallways. and
constantly ringing telephones.

One of the most noticable changes in
the dorms is the addition of two
bathrooms per tloor and the extraction
of the sinks in the individual rooms
(with the exception ot Clarkt.
Carpeting, brightly colored wall paint,
cork bulletin boards, colorful
draperies, and thermo pane windows il-
lustrate the specific alternations of the
renovated dorms' interior structures.
However, one cannot overlook the
reduction in the size of the stainvells
and the lowering of the ceilings.

Students have made both positive and
negative comments about the issue of
housmg improvements. Two junior
women said that they approved 0[ the
basic design changes in clark, but
disliked the drastically different shapes
of the rooms, They also believe that it is
unnecessary to have two bathrooms on
each floor and in fact they believe that
the older bathrooms on campus are
superior to the new. Another student
made the comment that there is a dif»
ferent atmosphere in the old buildings
but she also approved of the basic
design changes in Clark.

it is evident that the renovation plans

. included a structural change in the
social space in each dorm. With the ad
dition of kitchens, study lounges and
PDR'S (in ﬁle cases of Main and
Cowles), students now have more

' variety in places to study, socialize,
play music, watch television, or
prepare tood. Langan and Smith, for
example, each have a kitchen added to
the first floor. .

Another issue related to renovation
improvements is the change in student
furniture. In both Main and Norris,
wooden module furniture replaced the
old metal-type bed frames, wardrobes,
and desks, Some people have complain
ed that the module furniture is bother-
some because of the extreme height of
the buiiked beds and the lack of

cooperation of the College to store the
extenders. However, arrangements
have been made to lower the loll of the
bunk beds if the students leel that their
beds are too high. but each student
must still store the unwanted extenders
in their rooms.

Although renovations have altered
the basic floor plan in various dorms,
some people have argued that there is
now a reduction in the number ol
singles on campus. Statistically, there
are now i2 lewer singles on campus, bui
south campus has taken the greatest
loss. it now has 14 lewer singles than it
did three years ago.

There are three basic reasons why
there are less singles on south campus.
First, Mears had housed 57 students in
30 rooms, four of which were singles,
until the [all at 1975. Secondly, renova-
tions in Main cutout seven singles and
added two bathrooms to each floor And
finally, Cleveland will have three less
singles when it is Completed in late 06’
tober or early November.

At this time, room distribution does
seem to be unequal when north and
south campuses are compared. In
terms at the renovated dorms only,

there are two more additional siiiglcs
on north campus and 14 iewcr singles
on south campus, Also the int-reuse iii
the number oi doubles on campus has
greatly altered the room distributions
throughout the campus, South campus
now has a total at 126 singles and 123
doubles while north campus boasts 207
singles Lind 15l doubles, With the class
mg of Mears, renovations, and the Nor-
ris addition, north campus gained 42
doubles and south campus lost 18.

The process at renovation is also
eliminating triples, viith 3B presently
existing on campus, down trom as
belore renovations began Dean 01
Housing Susan Witipenn admits this is
an intentional phenomena because
more problems arise when three peoplc
live together than with only two,

At the present time there are 984
students living In the brick dormitories
and 7! in college owlied houses, The Stu-
dent Aliairs Ol’iice indicated that the
renovations on Cleveland are running
on schedule and people Will be occupy-s
ing it by late October or early
November. The next dorm to be
renovated will be Head and this project
will begin in November.

SGA condemns housing shortage

by Earl) Ritter

The Student Government Association
iSGAt overwhelmingly approved a let
ter condemning admissions policies
that lead to Crowded dorms. Due to an
overSight last semester there were too
many empty dorms on campus. leading
to a loss ol revenues for the college. The
administration's remedy seems to be to
increase the number at students ac
cepted here, while limiting the quota oi
students that may live in oil-campus
housing.

The Joint Board lists as their Coin-
plaints the quota on offscampus hous-
ing, the undue stress placed on
lreshman and transfer students that
must live in makeshift housing, and the
sacrilice of community areas in dorms
In some instances this poor planning
has resulted in loss of access to fire
escapes.

The letter strongly recommends that
certain alternatives be applied to the
housing policies, First, that the student
attrition rate be better assessed, and
second, that the present quotas be re»
examined and readjusted,
