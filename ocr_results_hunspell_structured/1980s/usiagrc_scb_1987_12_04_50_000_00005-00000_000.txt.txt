plays a young niii worker eager
to succeed. Despairing oi a promo-

except seeing the beautiiul

Jonas who will be 25 in the year 2000

by‘Gregg Siewert

“Jonas qui aura 25 ans en l’an
2000” was released in 1576 and
directed by Alain Tanner, whose
other successiul iilms have includ-
ed “La Salamandre," “Le Milieu
du monde." “Messrdor,” and
“Light Years Away " The “Jonas"
screenplay was ecswritten with
John Berger, the proliiic British
essayist, novelist. and art critic.
“Jonas" will remind even the most
blase viewer oi John Sayles‘
"Return oi the Secaucus 7“ and oi
”The Big Chlll.” but this iilm
delivers its message more
thoroughly and at a higher level.

The story line, though it does
develop in French. is easily at”
cessible thanks to the spirited work
oi the actors. who play eight young
men and women struggling to
make sense of their lives in
Geneva. Switzerland. the land oi
money and J..l Rousseau. Here.

the Frenchspeaking Swiss oi the
iilm are not portrayed as the
stereotyped dullrwitted country
iolk that French people on the
other side oi the Alps use as a
source ior their jokes. its in
Berger‘s books on rural France
(Pig Earth. Once in Europal, the
characters are more important
than ideology, although “Jonas” '
themes include history. urbanizar
tion oi the countryside. ecology,
class struggle. lost opportunity,
aging, alienation. and education.
Jonas is indeed that sacriiiced
prophet that the whale oi history
\vlll spit out in the year low. The
characters in Jonas' extended
family have little time to prepare
liim tor the iollowing millennium.
but despite personal disillusion and
the daily wear-andrtear that grind
them away. they ry their hardest
to do so. as well as to promote the

sense ol community that the
University oi Michigan grads oi
“The Big Chill“ iailed to maintain

Pauline Kael compares “Jonas"
to Renolr's egalitarian iilms oi the
thirties, and Rolling Stone
reviewer Jonathon Cott praised the
iilm ior presenting “the most
joyous and sympathetic beings
seen on the screen since the days oi
the great Marcel Fagnol classics "
Now that Pagnol is once again
claiming lost glory lior the novels
irom which came “Jean de
Florette" and "Manon”i. come

Company, Spike himseli, and
Spike’s lather, Bill Lee, who wrote
the score and played Nola’s lather
as well.

The plot centers around Nola
Darling. a young black graphic
designer living in Brooklyn. She
has three hoyiriends and wants to
keep it that way. The only problem
is that each at the three wants to be
the only one: Nola is stuck lacing
the good ole double standard.
There are other complications as
well: everyone else in the world

has an opinion oi Nola's predica-
ment, and they don't hesitate to put
their 2 cents in.

The only big problem with this
iilm is with one scene that is shot in
color, which sticks out like a sore
thumb and doesn't really succeed
in making its point. Otherwise,
“She‘s Gotta Have It” is a
remarkable success.

Harold and Maude I

by Gretchen Kehler

Due to its bizarre twist to the
conventional romance Story.
“Harold and Maude" has achieved
status as a cult iilm. i-iarold (Bud
Com is a wealthy outcast whose
only hobbies are staging original
suicide attemps and attending
iunerals. A chance meeting with
the vivacious 7oyear-old Maude
(Ruth Gordon) begins to challenge
Harold's depressed outlook.
Maude shares her ioy oi life with

Harold and he becomes less sullen
and ieariul.

Together they dance, plant a
tree, and deiy authority in the per»
son of Harold's militaristic Uncle
Victor, As Maude tells Harold, “i
love to see things grow." This
movie stresses the importance oi
individuality and the need ior
ireedom. Audiences can underSr
land the narrowness oi Harold's
liie beiore he met Maude and re-

joice in the happiness, however un~
conventional, that she brings him.
“Harold and Maude" is an odd
Combination of black comedy and
life attirmation. Much is added to
the film by the Cat Stevens sound
track.
