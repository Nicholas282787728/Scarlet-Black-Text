Weekend Pinder, Johnson provide fine show

Catch one of two final performances

WITH THREE GREAT FILMS. . . it’s
really hard to call one “best” this
weekend. All three are completely dii»
ferent, yet equally excellent. In
chonological order, the first is It Happened
One Night (1934, 110 min.). This film began"
the genre of the sophisticated romantic
comedy and it still holds up well today, A
wealthy socialite (Claudette Colbert) tries
to escape from her father and fiancee and
finds romance with a reporter (Clark
Gable) in a cross-country bus. It’s an
awiul lot of fun. especially when the
“Walls of Jericho" come tumbling down,
This is also the iilm that put a damper on
the undershirt business, when Gable’s un-
dressing revealed nothing but skin, And it
for no other reason, this film should be
seen to relish the incomparable Clark
Gable in full force. In 1934 this Capra
classic captured the top five Academy
Awards (a teat not equalled untilOne Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest). A film not to be
missed.

Pure, Glorious Fosse. . . Undoubtedly one
of the finest musicals in recent time,
Cabaret (1972, 124 min.) takes hold 01 the‘
audience and never lets go. This film
depicts Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) and
her “divinely decadent” lifestyle in pre-
WWII Berlin. Singing at the KitrKat’Club
and pursuing a iantasy about being in the
movies, Sally meets Brian Roberts
(Michael York) and falls in love. The
predictable complications arise. The story
seems secondary however, ior its the
bravura performance of Liza and the
unbelievable direction of Bob Fosse that
make this movie unique, The musical
numbers skillfully revolve around the
amazingly talented Joel Grey and pro-
vides an ironic counterpart to the action.
In certain ways, however, Liza is too great
for this film. Sometimes it’s hard to
believe that someone this talented is
destined to spend her life singing in third
rate night clubs. This eighttime Academy
Award winner provides an evening or in-
spired entertainment with a bittersweet
edge,

Another Option, . . directed by Franco
Brusla, Bread and Chocolate (1978) is a
rueiul comedy, a caustic social satire lame
pooning Imlian civility. Nino, an out or
work italian, wanders into Switzerland
where tension between newcomer and
society arise; “We often can’t stand each
other, so imagine how ioreigners l'eel "
Nino struggles to iit into this new culture,
even dying his hair blonde, but the true
man keeps busting out. This is definitely a
rim worth watching both tor its obvious
humor and its poignant soClal comment.

IN TOWN . . . Burt and Dolly irollc in The
Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. a bastar-
dization of the wonderiul Broadway play,
By creating a romance between Burt and
Dolly, the lilm ignores the original score
and provides nothing but a very tepid rela-
tionship. Not that this is a bad iilm, in lacl
technically it is very well made it just
could have been much brtter had lhey
stuck to the original plan .

In a two-person show, it is essential that
the actors be able to work well together
and achieve a delicate balance of per»
sonality. it one character overpowers the

other, the viewer must endure a lopsided, .

heavyhanded portrayal which leaves one
unsatisfied.

Luckily, such is not the casein Grinnell’s
current production or Talley's Folly. Tom
Johnson and Martha Finder play off each
rider well, maintaining a good balance or
emotions that keep the Viewed attentive
throughout.

As Matt Friedman, Tom Johnson works
the audience and the character {or all they
are worth. His opening monologue sets a
fine pace for the show and demonstrates
his deft comic abilities. He undoubtedly
startled some audience members with his
direct speech, but his manner serves w
develop his character and endear him to
die audience. The {ears and anguish Matt
feels, along with his overwhelming love for
Sally, are convincingly conveyed.

Johnson found an equal in Martha
Finder’s Sally Talley, a woman saddled
with her own anxieties about love and lite
in general. In U’lis show, the character 0!
Matt can easily take the upper hand and
overshadow Sally. But Pinder’s
characterization of Sally matches
Johnson’s pertormance every step oi the
way. She handles the emotional confrontar
tions with aliectionate humor and spir'

Jan Czechowski’s skilled direction
shows through in both the technical
aspects and the periormances he elicits
irom his players. The pacing is generally
good throughout, and the blocking allows

Don't Forget. . . Landscape alter Battle
(1970, 110 min.), which acts as the transi
tion lilm between Wajda's previous trilogy
and his more current ﬁlms. Wajda
described himself as a “violent
romantic;" in this film, a desperate love
story set against a background of post-war
chaos, Wajda does not depart from his
quest to depict the Polish struggle. The
characters, ‘liberated’ Polish concentra-
tion camp prisoners, find themselves stuck
in a displaced persons camp, being neither
free nor imprisoned. One man, a memory
haunted intellectual, hidﬁ within his
books until he mees a female refugee who
breaks down his self-imposed wall, This is
a very moving lilm that looks at human
values and emotions under varied cirz
cumstance. “It is so beautifully composed,
so eleglacal it compells attention and will
he likely to stay in the memory for a very
long time.’_' 7 New York Times

though the actors have to contend with a
threequarter stage.

A special note should be made or the set,
designed by Czechowski, which vividly
recreates a turn-oi-the-century “folly“ or
boathouse, Intricate detail and care shine
through, and the Viewer can almost smell
the Ozark air and hear the flow of the
river.

The series of levels provides a more in-
teresting acting space and a better view-
ing range {or the audience. The Costumes,
simple but appropriate, capture the period
and the sense of the Character.

The script itself remains one of the finest

Peppmconltl's

to come out In years Laniord Wilson, a
genius in his own right, has written
humorous, understated dialogue for his
two careiully constructed characters. vet
for all its humor, the story has a poignant,
almost melancholy, undertone which
makes the show all the more rich.

Talley’s Folly (running 36 minutes, not
96) has a lot to offer as it focuses on the two
lovers' struggle to break through the pro-
tective barriers which prevent them from
displaying aliection ior each other.

The two final performances take place
tonight and tomorrow night in Arena
Theatre at 8 pm. Admission is free.
