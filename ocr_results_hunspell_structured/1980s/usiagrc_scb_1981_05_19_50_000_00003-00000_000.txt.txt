25 years in the life of a college

The climates of Grinnell

by James Kissarle

It's a shocking reminder of how long I‘ve
been at Crlrlnell to realize that surling
Library, whrch didn’t exist when I started
teaching here, is now in need ol an
overhaul I’d rather not dwell on the parallels
between the present condition or Burllng
and my own possrble need oi repair, tts
more interestrng to rellect on the changes in
store lor the lrbrary as they symbolize the
dillerences one leels between what the Cells
legs was Ilka lrl the lale 1950's and how ills
today

Buvlmg was an important expression ol a
new era at Grinneil The College had been
visited by a new academic climate, one i
should label a climate ol slandavdss I don]
mean excellence had not been a goal at the
College all along, but in the late ’50’s and
early '60’s we embraced the word "th
cellence" did not provoke cynrcrsrn lrom the
laculty nor liscal conservatrsm lrom the
trustees.

The leature ol Eulllng that best rellected
that climate was the study lounge in the
mezzanine called “The Twentieth Century
Room.’ The idea was to till the handsome
shelves lining its walls with the greatest
books written in our own century, The lurr
ntture chosen lot this room was a collection
oi pieces representing the most distinguished
styles ol the twentieth century The ellect
was a rather museumvllke bul nonetheless
pleasing and altogether impressive ”an-
thulogy’ ol modern design work by tames,
Saarinen, Mres van der Rohe, and other
masters ol the art.

To create a space containing the most im»
portant modem books and appoint rt with
the most elegant modern lurniture must
hgure to many today as a curious and
pretentious extravagance, at the time it
seemed to the College an appropriate way
ol putting the best in lront ol its students
The room was certainly comlorotble, but its
utiltty was not the point so much as its class
The aim was insprratton and perhaps a bit ol
earnest llattery.

This spring, by contrast, as plans lor Burl
mg's renovation advance, carpenters have
created a mockcup ol portions ol a ”study
{owef' that vvrll consist ol a complex ol car-
rels penectly suited to the study habits of
Cvlnnell's students. They have been urged to
try out these mockcups, and student test
trons and suggestions will be rellected in the
lrnal desrgns ol the iurnrshings and spaces oi
this study tower Such canvassing ol student
prelerences would not have occurred to the
architects and planners ol the Twentieth
Century Room, to do so would have con-

tradicted the assumption that those
prelerences were more to be inlluenced by
the College environment then vice versa.
The study tower, however, will (assuming
the students ”input” has been ellectrvel
rellect then tastes and should ol course be
enormously popular, at least so long as
those tastes remain in lorce,

l |ake the study tower to be symptomatrc
or the mstrtutional climate we have been
passing through, a climate not of standards
but ol services. As l see it, the instituttonal
authority the administration and the laculty
relinquished dunng the midsstys and early

merely a to please, we are now experts at
what pleases. This spring our preoccupation
with services reached its acme with the in
itiation oi a shuttle to the liquor store

No doubt its an attractive duarlty tn a col;
lege to be gracious and'obligrng to its
students. But making prov on lor sludents
is not the same as educating-them. A
climate ol services leads students to thinlt ol
themselves as clients or customers. They will
expect, merelore, to have their tastes and
values catered to rather than challenged,
enriched, or relined. To encourage students

current competition among pnvate colleges
lor oualthed students and also the relatrvely
grim prospects lacing many lrberal arts
graduates, it is hardly surprising that a coir

situated than, say, Harvard should malte its
appeal to students through an increasing arr
