Former rules not ade uate

 

KDIC handout outlines new DJ regulations

by Brendan Shepherd

KDIC has put its rules and
regulations in black and white.

The ﬁvevpage handout is a
result of the controversy that
rocked the campus last Spring.
Some studens complained about
comments made by disc jockeys
during the course of their shows
and a self-imposed week~long
station shutdown ensued along
with DJ dismissals. Station
manager Wayne Seaman said.
however, that the rule booklet
was not entirely because of the
incident

"There were a lot of problems
before second semestt r last year,"
he said.

The rules cover application
procedures. studio conduct.
broadcast considerations, as well
as penalties and ﬁnes.

“In the past. mles were virtu~
ally nonaexislant...therc was no
policy for enforcement." Seaman
said.

Previously, the regulations
were on a single sheet. touching
on only a few basic guidelines.
KDIC administrative adviser and
associate dean of students Steven
Jones said the skeleton regula-
tions were not adequate.

Sonia Chamette and other KDIC disc jockeys will be forced to follow stricter
guidelines this year to avoid a repeat of last year‘s on-lhe-air controversy.

"They did not cover the scope
that we felt needed to be." he
said.

Although Jones said he
thought that last semester's inci-
dent was "handled relatively
well." he wished the new rules

would have been already in place
prior to the flare-up so the DJs
would have known their respon-
sibilities. '

The new rules, developed
mainly by Jones and Seaman,
state that the station supports

DJs First Amendment rights to
broadcast "recorded materials" of
their choice. Further, "KDIC ad-
vises Dis to use their judgment
when choosing materials [or
broadcast and to use disclaimers
for certain songs or entire

shows." the rules state. Jones
and Seaman agreed that music
choice wasn't the issue.

“The music wasn‘t a problem,
not the case at all. DJs can play
anything they want, within their
format," Seaman said,

Jones explained that a DJ
should use a disclaimer to "notify
the listener that what they are
about to hear they may ﬁnd of-
fensive."

If a written complaint is re-
ceived. the Student Publication
and Radio Committee will
"investigate the matter. hold a
prompt and fair hearing and then

plinary action is necessary." 5er

Jones said the complaints
will be handled "on an individual
basis, based on the circum-
stances."

Junior Bill Collins, one of
the DJs suspended last Spring
said he thinks the niles are good.

"Last year we were suspended
without fair and adequate wam-
ing. KDIC is making sure
they're covered this time," he
said. "i think it's good for people

Tindall eases into physical plant job

By Jessica Weisel

One of the first things Dan
Tindall intends to do as physical
plant director is to make his ofr
flee less formal. "I feel as if I'm
in a doctor's office," he joked.
"Hell. I'm almost intimidated."
Outside his ofﬁce. though, he
intends to make Grinncll's facili-
ties as efficient as possible.

Tindall, formerly director of
the physical plant at Aims
Community College in Greeley,
Colorado. made it clear that there
will be changes in the physical
plant. and he believes people ex-
pect those changes. Tindall re-
places Dale Hawn. who had
worked at. Grinncll for 21 years
before his retirement last year.

In replacing Hawn, Tindall
must cope with the reputation
left by his predecessor. "I've
gotten a general feeling," lic said,
"that maybe Buildings and
Grounds (B&G) has been hard to
gel to know and hard to see.
That won‘t be the case with me.”
He enjoys "lulking to students,
sitting with students. answering
questions. I invite calls. "If
there‘s a problem. I'd much rather
hctlr about it before it becomes an
issue." he said.

One of the new director's

and lawn mowing to be conducted
in less time. The new lawn
mower should be quieter, so it

 

will no longer force professors to

"going to try and be sensitive to
the educational process." but he
will not promise to completely
stop mowing during class limes.
