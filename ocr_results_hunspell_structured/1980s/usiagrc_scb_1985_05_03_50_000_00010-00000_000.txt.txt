Dear Vludcnts. faculty, ads
ininistratoi and people or Grinnell‘

A thought to turn over and back dur»
ing the next three months oi vacation:
llilcl‘prellng the student body to have
physical properties. i proposethat it be
declared a “sanctuary" for Central
American retugecs ilccing persecution
in their liomelands, Walt! Not just like
that. i think that it is possible to apr
preach this issue with a mind toward
educating ourselves. unified as one pot»
ple Before ”19 issue is discussed. I beg
that you consider the concept or sanc-
tuary as an humanitarian response to
obvious suffering I! can be discussed
without great party line debates iroin
‘ liberals and Conservatives," It can be
discussed Without blind. unyielding sup-
port lor the one who is right because
they are your iriend. This is my
challenge:

We would haven) one or two day long

Unfortunately there is an element oi

considered as lawbreakers. As it
stands. the courts are nol Judging large

Moreover. it is unlikely that this will
