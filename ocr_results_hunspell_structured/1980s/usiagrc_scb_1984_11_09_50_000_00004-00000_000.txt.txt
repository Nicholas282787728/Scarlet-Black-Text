Sexist language: one perspective

by Karry Kooii

In this article, 1 will attempt to
illustrate sexist language and to
oiier options to it i am making
two assumptions in my attempt.
The iirst assumption is that our
language iniluences the way we
think. This is known as the
Humbolt-WhorvaeeeSaplr
hypothesis, in which it is argued
that the concept- and articulation
capabilities oi a language limit
the speakers' perceptive ability.
The second assumption is that
language can be, and oiten is, sex-
isl; in support oi this assumption 1
will describe the “muted group"
theory and oiier some examples
oi sexist language, My conclusion.
iollowing irom the above two
assumptions: since it iniluences
our thought, and thus helps
perpetuate discrimination against
women, linguistic sexism should

be eliminated.
Beiore l attempt my definition,

1 will describe the “muted group”
theory. This theory explains that
our language is sexist and racist
because language is created and
used by the dominant group in the
society. in our society, oi course.
the dominant perspective is white
and patriarchal. Thus, we use
language to describe our world
irom a ivhite male viewpoint. or
“the maleeisenorm viewpoint.” as
one linguist, Cheris Kramarae.
has described it (We all knovi
that Black English is not “starts
dard” English. but we do not call
standard English "white"
English. While is the accepted
norm. Just as male is l A reveals
ing example of the male perspec
tive in our language is this: sexual
intercourse is referred to as
“penetration" rather than
"enclosure,” ll hope 1 haven‘t
again “lowered the level of joui‘s
nalism” in the SM; by including
this “obscene" example.7 Now on
to my three-part illustration.
There are words used in referrs
ing to women that are obvmusly
sexist chick. broad, and so on
This is more signiiicant than it
iirst appears. Two hundred-
twenty words that are speciiically
derogatory to women have been
compiled by Julia P. Stanley in a
paper entitled. “Paradigniatic
Woman: The Prostitute." She
reports that most oi these terms
are sexual ones. and are used by
men to refer to women. She notes
that there are very iew words
referring derogatorily to promi-
scuous MEN. Cheris Kramarae.
author of Women and Men Speak
ing. comments that linguists
recognize that. “Neutral terms
used to name women gradually
acquire negative implications and
alien iinally carry obscene or
debased connotations." This is not
feminist hogwash; the best known

American etymologist, H.L. Men
cken, a man certainly not known
ior his interest in women's issues,
noted this in his book, The
American Language; An inquiry
into the Devlopiiient oi English in
the u. 5. There are many ex-
amples ot words that once had
either neutral or positive connotar
tions, and which now carry
negative ones, including nymph.
broad. iloozie. and spillster. Even
the word “woman" when used as

a form of address has a
derogatory sense, according to
The leord English Dictionary,
This same phenomenon is not
usually found in “ords that refer
to men, To eliminate this type oi
sexist language, we must either
stop using words such as-
"ii-bore." or start applying them
equally to men.

A second example oi sexist
language, and one that has
generated much cuntrovers -. is
the use of "man" and "he as
generic terms. Experiments slioit
that “man" and “he" are NOT
recognized as gender neutral tp
1th of “omen and Men Speaking
is one source.) People more often
recognize a use of the so-called
generic “he" as reierring to a
male. rather than reierring to
male or female Thus. school
children recognize a “caveman"
anda “policeman" as males. God
is even viewed as male because of
the male terms that are identified

This bias in our language is very
easy to correct, simply by swit-
ching to true gender neutral terms
such as “caveperson” and “police
officer," and by occasionally
reierring to God as “Mother."
“He,” when it is used in a neutral
sense. should be replaced with
something like “he or she,” (I per
sonally like the written construc
tion. she/he, but if this is used
in spoken language. it is sexist.)
The third part of my definition

is a brief look at how men and
women use the English language
differently. This is simply to make
us aware of how we speak. There
are many words and phrases that
are identified as being used by one
sex or the other. it the words
“darling," “divine," and “lovely"
are used. there is a cultural
assumption that the speaker is
either a gay male or a woman,
Women are also expected to be
more interested in deiinmg cola
ors; ior instance. a man will say
“red," while a Woman will say
”scarlet" or “crimson." You
rarely hear a man using words
such as “corn" and ”Chartreuse."
Oil the other hand, "real" men are
assumed to use more coarse
language than women, including a
large amount oi slang and swear-
ing, How men and women speak is
DEFINED culturally, too. When
men are talkative. they are called
articulate, talkative women are
described as gabby. When men
talk together, we call it convers
lion; when women talk together.
we call it gossip. There are other
examples, but i won't go on.

larifying socialism

by Mike Cleary

Recently there was a revtew oi
Hayek's The Road to Serftlom in
the Outcry. in it, we find an argu»
ment for keeping government
small so as not to let it become op-
pressive. That is one side of the
issue, and it contained a number
oi misconceptions about
socialism. Here. hoping to correct
these misconceptions. is the other
side.

The reviewer says that liberals
want to grant “privileges" to cer-
tain people or institutions at the
expense of others. Liberals may
want to do that, but not socialists.
Socialists see the issue different-
ly. R. H. Tawney, in his book
Equality, deiines privilege as an
undue advantage some have at
the expense of others. Socialists
want to take privileges away, to
make society more egalitarian,
thus more democratic.

l-iayek says that there is a
tendency ior people to want things
done ior them, and we may inier
that the power-hungry in govern
ment (and let there be no doubt.
there are many) naturally oblige
Again, this is not a danger posed
by socialism. Socialists do not
believe that elites can bring
anything but bad government to
the people; the people must
become their own government as
much as possible. Leaders have
their role ”1 drawing people into
this process. Indeed, we recently
heard a similar opinion from Ben
jamin Barber. who urg d us to
iorgc "strong deinocrac ' by in'
valuing the people. And in
response to a question about the
people's current inability to do
this. he replied that if they are not
involved in the process. they calla
not learn. and our “weak"
democracy will atrophy even
more

Finally, llayek arranges his
argument around the danger of a

iully centralized government,
which can only lead to oppression.
This describes the totalitarian
aspect of communism. But do not
call it socialism! There is nothing
in socialism that recommends a
planned economy. Socialists want
an economy as decentralized as
possible. Cooperatives and come
munication between labor and
management come hrst. Public
ownership of certain industries is
secondary This means govern
ment control. yes. but under the
conditions prescribed above. The
boards of directors may well be
elected,

The review and this critique
might show, more than anything
else, how the two sides approach
an issue from opposite ends.
Perhaps the best example is
Hayek's complaint that people
want things done ior them. This is
more likely in a capltallst’s world
than a socialist’s Unlimited
wants. including the desire for
leisure time. and rationality are
the rules of human behavior
ground into the mind of every stu-
dent of microeconomics. If these
are true. people naturally want
things done ior them A capitalist
wouldn't challenge this, It‘s just
"selfslnterest".

Socialists begin with a belief
that human nature isn‘t so simple.
For them. “self»interest” holds
vilthln itself the realization that
what can happen to other people
can happen to oneseli. Put in a
less calculating vei people see
others like themselves. they place
value in other people, t'l'his idea
needs elaboration elseuhere. but
please try to understand what it
inlplies.7 ll lollous that society

‘Grounds for thought’

by Ellen \teiiistock

What can one say about 'l'uesc
day's election that hasn't already
been said? Perhaps the best thing
lo do is simply list'reasons ior
Democrats to feel better:

ll’l‘om Harkin won. Democrats
picked up several very useiul
seats 7 the ones vacated by
'l’songas and Baker in
Massachusetts and Tennessee
were won by Kerry and Gore;
Jepsen and Percy's losses brought
us two oi the strongest prorarms
Control Senators we could want

ZlAlthough Jesse Helms won in
North Carolina. something which
was especially reared because
Percy's loss puts Helms first in
line for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, he has pro~
inised his constituents that he will
keep the chairmanship oi the
Agriculture Committee. and it is
conceivable that he would keep
his promise, .

allteagan's “coattails” did not
reach very far. in 1982, he had
huge midterm losses in the House
and In the Sealltc. All he has to
lose is three or {our Senators in
1986. and both houses 01 the con-
