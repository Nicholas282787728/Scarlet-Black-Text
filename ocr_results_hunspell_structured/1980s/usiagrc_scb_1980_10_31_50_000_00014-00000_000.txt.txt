A Trustee speaks on sports

To the Editor: Once again I read with
great interest and concern the discus-
sion concerning Grinnell College’s in-
tercollegiate athletic programs. For
what it is worth, I would like to offer a
few comments, As a iormer athlete,
alumnus, and present trustee or the ins

stitution, I have always advocated the

need ior Grinnell to put forth a positive
eilect to have a quality athletic pro-
gram. I advocated this not because of a
strong desire to relive past glories, a
need to live vicariously in present vic»
tories, or for any other similar inane
reasons. I strongly advocated a strong
program because I thought:

I1) It is good {or the individual
athlete, ,

(2) It can unify a community.

l3) It gives a sense of pride to an in
stitution that individual scholastic
achievements can not.

From my personal experiences, ex
tensive readings, and many conversa-
tions with others, l think these three
points have been validated over the
ye'ars throughout the United States, as
well as the rest of the world. For those

individuals, be they faculty members,

students. or administrators who con-
tinually agree to the contrary. I feel
they should look outside of Grinnell and
at-their own personal motives. I would
simply ask them on question:

If there was a direct correlation betv
ween intercollegiate athletics and
scholastic a hievement, why is it

or Michigan win their respective con-
icrences year in and year out?

As President Drake and others have
pointed out, one can be an achiever in
sports and in the classroom at the
same time.

In sum, I think those who constantly
oppose intercollegiate athletics should
look at their motlves. Over the past ten
years I have had many discussions with
students and iaculty members and

The hidden issue

To the Editor: One of the most crucial
”single issues" which voters vill face
next Tuesday is not explicitly listed on
the ballot as are the options of adding
the Iowa ERA to the state constitution
or deciding whether to re-write the
Iowa Constitutuion. Yet this “unspoken
issue" affects the national ERA. aborr
tion, the draft, nuclear proliferation,
and all national legislation that will be
considered over the next ll) years by at-
fecting (if not determining) the U.s.
congressional delegation oi Iowa. This
issue is reapportionment, or the
redrawing of Us, congressional
district lines, in accordance with the
state‘s decennial population changes,
Both Hie Democratic and Republican
parties have, traditionally, done all in
their power to control the state
legislatures which re-draw conges-
sional district boundaries. (The majori-
ty party has much to gain from the
ability to reapportion. One stategy used
in the past was to “divide and conquer”

usually, after many hours oi debate, it

However. in Iowa, most political

The secret is sharing

To the Editor: lwould like to address
myseli to the controversy over Skip
Day. I lee] as though there has been
some sort of misunderstanding as to
what Skip Day really is.

I feel that we students have been a lit»
tle bit selfish in our view of Skip Day. It
is not a day to skip classes in order to
spite our proiessors, ”Skip Day" or
perhaps more appropriately "Spree
Day" is a whimsical celebration ot the
arrival oi spring and the end oi a dreary
winter. It should be in the tradition of
student and faculty unity, a day ior both
students and professors to enjoy a day
off.

Is it right that we students should
hoard all the good iood, good music,
and good times to ourselves? Why
should we exclude our beloved pro-
fessors iiom this important portion oi
the Grinnell Experience? I don't think
you will ever see a happier face than
when you hand your biology professor
his first squirt gun, or than that ol an
emeritus as he is div g ior a lrisbee,
lWell, maybe not div, 7 Perhaps it is
time that we studentstreaddl'ess this
question of “Spree no so that it may
stand as a tradition for 'ears to come,
