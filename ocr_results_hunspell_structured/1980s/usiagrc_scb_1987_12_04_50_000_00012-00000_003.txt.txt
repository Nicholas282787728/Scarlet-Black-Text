Pioneer Dome To
grace Rosenbloom Field

by Alvin Davis

Declaring “an achievement
Grinnell College can be proud of,"
acting president Waldo Walker Dir
ticially announced that in the year
1993, all of Grinnell College's
athletic teams will play in the
Pioneer Dome a 100,000 seat
retractable-dome stadium The
stadium will be built on the current
site cl Rusenbloom Field, with con-
struction beginning in the spring oi
1908. For the seasons between 1980
and 1993 the Pioneer football team
will play its games at the Grinnell
High School field.

The impetus ior the construction
of a new stadium came from Waldo
Walker and irom the trustees.
Walker viewed the new stadium as
an important ingredient needed to
attract higher quality students and
higher quality iaculty. As Walker
pointed out, “We will have the
largest stadium of all the schools
ranked in US. News and World
Report. The Pioneer Dame will
make Grinnell College more visi-
ble to highrschool students across
the nation. The Pioneer Dome, the
new logo, and the new core
curriculum are all necessary steps
to attract a higher-quality student
lto Grinnell College."

The trustees thoroughly sup
ported the new stadium idea as a
way to further renovation of the
college, As one trustee said,
"We’ve done Mcars, the Science
Building and soon ARH, we might
as well do Rosenbloom. Maybe
alter that we will put another addi-
tion on top oi Burling or build

'another parking lot." Other
trustees indicated that wrth the
stockrmarket crash. the saiest in»
vestment oi the endowment's
money would be in construction oi
a multipurpose stadium. Trustees
such as Robert. Noyce, Steven
Jobs, and Warren Buiiet have en-
thusiastically donated millions oi
dollars to the construction lund,
The three are also the first to pur-
chase thc Pioneer Dome‘s $75,000
stadium boxes. The stadium boxes
are iurnished with eight leather
Chairs, a television set, a
rerrigerator, a bar, and a complete
library bi biographies about Harry
Hopkins

Reaction by most students to the
stadium was negative. SGA nl'r

iicials were outraged that the
stadium will be erected without a
student-initiative vote being taken,
and an iniormal discussion will be
held debating the advantages and
disadvantages oi the new stadium
in South Lounge on this Monday at
7:30 PM. SGA does hope to work
out an arrangement with the ad-
ministration so that the construc»
tion ot the stadium will include an
icerink, a dance iloor, a concert
hall. and a movie theater. Some
students have already expressed
extreme dissatisfaction with the
new suadium.

A student in Langan Hall moan
ed, “My financialraid money is
probably being used ior a row or
blue plastic bleachers" One resi-
dent ot an oiicampus house stated.
“Why can't this college think about
something else besides sports?
This college should spend its time
doing something about racism or
the homeless, I am sick oi this
ichonl, i am transierring to Colum»

la,”

New football coach Earle Bruce
was ecstatic about the announce
merit oi the new stadium, “This is
the happiest day oi my liie, this an-
nouncement has brought more joy
to my lite than Art Schlister ever
did. 1 loved coaching in iron: oi
100.000 screaming ions at Ohio
State, and i look iorward to the
same support here at Grinnell i
just hope the college will build a
race track soon or else I might not
be here by 1993."

The stadium will be built similar
to Montreal's Olympic Stadium
The root, painted scarlet and black
on the outside and the inside. will
be made out oi a special plastic
designed by the Miraco Plastic
Company oi Grinnell. The dome
will be able to retract through the
use or a special silicon chip,
engineered by Grlnnell alumnus
Robert Noyce that can be in-
tegrated into the VAX to allow the
root to be opened and closed with
speed and ease.

The groundbreaking ceremony
for the new stadium will occur on
Christmas Day, December 25,
1987. to symbolize the good tidings
that the giit oi the Pioneer Dome
will bring to Grinnell athletics and
the spirit oi the Grinnell EX-
perienco

and humanitarian

*‘k‘k‘k‘k Mitch Snyder *‘k‘k'k‘kt

Dear Mitch,

rm pregnant and l'm a junior.
I'm Pro-lite but morning sickness
is keeping me irom my eight
o'clock which i need ior my major.
what can i do? — From Proud to
be a real woman

Dear From,

What can you do? You can quit
whining, that's what you can do. So
you're pregnant; big deal, Just
think ior a minute about the advan~
tages your baby has, Right now, it
has a warm place to sleep and gets
regular meals. This is a lot more
than the homeless oi this country
have. They don't know where their
next meal is coming irom. or
where they are going to spend the
night. You say you are a junior
Thank your lucky stars that you
can still drop out oi college in order
to help the homeless, By doing this
you will be periorming your duty to
your fellow man. It also will take
care oi the problem oi your eight
o'clock.

Dear Mitch,

I'm a typical virile heterosexual
male, However, due to stress irom
writing my six papers that are due
beiore iinals, t'vo had some pro-
blems “performing." it you know
what I mean. What it this becomes
permanent? What can i do to cor
rect this problem? — Down on
South Campus

Dear Down,

It you are, as you say, a “typical
virile heterosexual male," chances
are you know where you are going
to sleep each night. You also have
a good idea oi where your next
meal is coming irom, You are
privileged, In Des Moines, just an
hour away irom you, there are peo-
ple who desperately need shelter,
tood, clothing, and medical atten-
tion. Winter is coming up. Think oi
how enduring lowa's snow and
wind chill without any shelter, like
the homeless do, would ailect your
“performance." This holiday
season isn't going to be very warm
or merry ior this country's
homeless. The greatest giit you
could give them, one that would
relieve your guiltridden cons
cience, would be the giit oi your
time. You'll have plenty oi time to
salve your conscience it you take
this opportunity to drop out oi
school and devote your time,
resources, and talents to helping
the homeless, This should solve
your problems. and it will help
your iollow man at the same time.

Dear Mitch.

Last week my parents and baby
brother. three aunts, 17 cousins,
iour nephews, my dog and my cat
were all murdered in their beds.
This week i iound out my iinancial
aid was cancelled since l'm no
longer considered a “dependent”
or my parents. I wish I were dead.
How can i motivate myseli to
make it through this semester? ,
A Real Sensitive Guy

Dear A.

Your dog and cat had bcdsi
That's just another example oi the
kind oi stupid things people in this
country spend money on. They buy
prissy little beds ior their mangy
household pom while thousands oi
their iollow citlzens sleep on
heating grates, on sidewalks, and
in cardboard boxes, We certainly
live in a country with screwed-up
values when lower iorms or liie
live more comiortably than people
do. Don't worry about motivation
ior the rest oi the semester Drop
out and work helping the homeless,
This will give you something to
iocus your attention on.

By my count, you have 29 beds
you're not using any more Clear
your conscience. Clean up those
beds and donate them to the
homeless. You‘ll be glad you did.

— Mitch
es. 1 think your uncles did it.

Dear Mitch,

The other day l was sitting in the
grill talking with some lriends
about the plight oi the homeless. l
remembered the stirring poem you
ran in your column a tow years
ago, Could you please reprint it. tor
the betterment oi us all. 7 Con-
Cerned

Dear Concernedi

I'm always glad when one of my
works touches the heartrstrings oi
caring people like you. i wasn‘t
sure exactly which poem you
meant, but here's one of my
iavorites.

My mind wonders oi past event

0i whether they were time well»
spent

Why does man for his foolish
needs

Step on the poor with present
deeds?

What God
prepared

Rich people and capitalism have
gummi-beared
