Although not many people knew it,
the Board of Trustees made one oi their
triennial trips to Grinneli last Friday
and Saturday, The main purpose oi the
meeting was to decide whether to ap-
prove the renovation Lind expansion or
Burling Library

The general plan presented to the
Board was accepted and President
Drake said that now the college must
obtain lunds He said it wlll cost 3127
proximately $24.5 million. He added
that while it is not certain, construction
should begin by spring or 1982, and he
hoped students could use the library
while it was being worked on.

Nothing else substantial was decided
at the meetings. but see President
Paul Volker, Vice-President John Con»
yers, and Treasurer Sharon Rauland
discussed a possible increase in the Slur
dent Activities Fee. Volker said that the
Board will not make the final decision
until their next meeting in February.

of how much.

The Cabinet 01 Concerned Black

a declining black population at Grlnr

do even less.

The disadvantages oi die proposed
system, according to Tederman, in-
clude an absence of tin-campus ser-
vices, inconvienience, and lack oi the
rapport with nurses which students
presently enjoy. The college would not
want to be involved unless they could
hire a director of the service who would
be sensitive to students needs. Teder-
man noted that the hospital stall has
not always been sensitive to students in
the past,

General discussion of the plan was
very mixed and questions ranged lrom
transportation to what would happen to
the present stall of Irma Hail and Dons
na Bailey. Pam Hulnlck. the students
coordinator of ﬁle Health Center ‘10in
ed her opposition oi the plan, saying
that students are more willing to get
health care with the "'walkrin” element
at the present system. "Almost
epidemic situations," resulted this year
and she argues that students would be
even less willing to seek help ii they had
to get into a shuttle and drive two miles.

Hulnick and several Joint Board
members asked Tederman if instead of
phasing out the Health Center, they
could simply improve it. Tederman exr

oi the lunds trom the sale or WDTN-TV
in Dayton, Ohio. Drake said the money
(over $45 millioni will be used to “in-
sure the general linancial security" or
the college. He said the FCC has not
made their linal approval oi the sale
yet, but he loresees no problems, and
the money should be in the endowment
by early spring.

When asked why the Trustees were
not more visible, Drake said that it was
an oversight on his part. He said the
Board welcomes contact with the

plained that this would present the col
lege with many legal problems. Also, he
said that doctors have refused to work
out oi the Health Center, since they
need back-up care at the hospital.

One student argued for the proposal,
saying that the opposition was based on
“just a matter oi a couple of miles
(which is) no big deal,” This student
did not see the need for a “big, beautiful
building" where the nurses can “just
give out throat lozenges." Tederman
agreed by saying that he thought the
discussion was "hung up over the ques-
tion oi Zorhour access to an aspirin
(and) that's absurd."

Tederman cited Knox as one of
several other colleges with similar pro-
grams. The Committee on Student Life
will discuss the proposal next week,
Tederman suggested the possibility or
an open student lorum. but the ﬁnal
decisxon lies with the laculty.

discussion on the placement ol tour

As for the possibility oi a student
representative on the Board, Drake, a
iormer Trustee, said the members are
"unlikely to be receptive" to the idea,
and he is “not pushing” lor it. He said it
would be “tokenlsm” and a student
representative could not really ace
complish anything. He said he is imr
pressed with the system and ieels it
does not need to be changed.
