McConnell wants no Relays liability L

by liebecca “esttiii

Grinnel] Mayor Dave McConnell's Mor-
tar Board presentation last week rekindled
the debate on the luture of a campus traor
lion. While Students hope that the last 01,
licial Grinnell Relays wasn't last year.
neither the college nor the City seems to be
prepared to take on lull liability in games.

McConnell summed up the city‘s posiv
tion when he said. ”[We] want no liability
to the city," This concern about liability
stems irom a law suit involving a hit and
run accident {our years ago that cost the
city about two million dollars. McConnell
said. '

In order to minimize the college's liabili-
ty. the Grinnell Relays Committee propos-
ed that there be a fenced in area. wrist
identiﬁcation. and city auxiliary iorces
standing by.

McConnell's major complaint towards
the committee's proposal was that the
reserve lorces, it they were supplied by the
city. would not be able to merely standy-by
and keep watch. McConnell said. ”The
policeman cannot turn away irom drink
mg and drunk people. "Cannot send cops
without expecting them to enlorce the laws
completely." he added.

McConnell also said that fences would
not be an ellectlve deterrent against town
people or underage college students.

Furthermore. McConnell said that the
college should rethink the concept behind
the games it needs to consider. he said.

whether the real aim oi the games is to
relieve tension and to provide a good time
or to provide students with a chance to get
drunk.

McConnell also addressed the larger
issue ol the town's perception or college
students,

McConnell expressed concern by saying
that both communities are missing out on
a learning experience because both com-
munities are only aware or the other's
negative characteristics.

McConnell referred to a city council
meeting about South Atrican divestiture in
which college students spoke. The council
members believed that the students
disrupted the council's meeting. McCon»
nel] said.

When asked about the impact 0] at new
Federally imposed standard drinking age.
McConnell said he wonders about the
tuture of the pub The new law. according
to McConnell. is planned to go into eﬂecl in
Iowa. July 1. 1937.

Also in relation to the drinking age. MC-
Connell pointed out another problem The
question as to why underage Grinnell
students are not arrested (or drinking with
the same lrequency as town peoplc. Mc-
Connell commented that. whether the
discrepancy eXlStS or not. the arrest rate
issue is seen by the community as an issue
of the rich. educated college students vere
sus the poor. blue-collar town people.

Biosillphite. a chemical also known in
the iood service industry as “potato
lresheller“ because ol its ability to keep
vegetables looking trash. is. according to
Dave McConnell. no longer used by Food
oicGrlnnell (FOG).

FOG previously used biosulphite to keep
green lettuce green and to turn brown let-
tuce back to green again.

Due to current FDA reports about the
extreme health hazards biosulphite intake
is lor people with asthma. McConnel said
FOG switched irom using this synthetic
chemical to a mixture ot citric acid.
calcium chloride. calcium phosphate and
erythorblc acid.

FOG also changed the delivery schedule
tor lettuce. it now arrives in the atternoon
to be used {or the tollowing dinner and
luncii

Citric acid. according to McConnell. is a
much less cttective iihitencr than
hiosulphite. but he'd rather - ' -h ten
dollars worth of lettuce than try to salvage
it with biosulphite it's not worth the risk.“
hc said.

When asked hovi common the use oi
biosulphite is in the 100d industry. li’lCUOll'
nel emphatically stated "most everyone
uses it " Restaurants \yith salad bars pros
bably all "\ihiten" lheir vegetables with
this chemical

Canned vegetables are also treated with
tiiusulphite. but McConnell believes its
harmtul eiiects are nullerl due to the
sterilization temperatures ol the canning
process.

When asked why this\Cheliilcal is used.
McConnell stated that the reasons are
purely cosmetic. not nutritional The
average American tood consumer is
timcky. he said. He believes that we have
been spoiled by the easy availability ot
non~regiunal produce. Yellowrng or brown-
inlﬂfvegetables do not sell.
