African Art Now on View

“West and Central African Art' is the ti-
tle of 1985787 opening exhibition now on
view in the Print and Drawing Study Room
Gallery, lower level, Burllng Library on
the Grinnell College campus. Traditional
tribal society masks and sculpture are the
primary focus of ths show. However,
household items such as rallia pile cloths,
a royal ritual cosmetic box, prestige
storage basket, and a royal wrap of beaten
bark are also included

The various face and helmet masks and
the freestanding sculpturalworks in wood
and metal provide a first-hand opportunity
to view the craftsmanship and skill of
unknown carvers who, in the performance
of executing an object to serve a particular
tribal function, reveal highly sensitive and
enduring artistic images Cowrie shells,
seed pods, beads, wood and clay powders,
and rafiia enhance the textural aspects of
realisticallyrcarved items as well as those
more abstract in design, Affinities bet-
ween the abstract stylization of some
African sculpture and the work of such
contemporary artists as Pablo Picasso,
Henri Matisse, Paul Klee, and Constantine
Brancusi can be readily made.

of unique interest in this exhibition are
the masks depicting various animals, as
well as humans, and the dramatic shift in
scale of a small miniature mask to that of
the great Nimba helmet mask which
measures five feet in height.

Organized by Professor Richard
Cer‘vene from holdings in the college’s
Permanent Art Collection, this exhibition
will continue through September 26, The
Print and Drawing Study Room Gallery is
open from 1:15 to 5 pm. Sunday through
Friday. Additional distinctive African art
objects are on continuing display in the
Black Library area. second floor, Burling
Library, and in the receptionrgailery area,
first floor, Mears l-lall.

Stuntman

A fugitive from the law (Steve
Raishacki stumbles on to a movie location
and falls into a web of confusion over what
is illusion and what is reality. He is taken
in by the movie’s director (Peter O’Toole)
and hired as the replacement oi a stunt
man whose mysterious death he has just
witnessed Confused and paranoid
Rallsback can not determine whether
0 Toole is his private savior or Satan,
whether he is safer in the hands of the law
or subject to O‘Toole's maniacal caprices.
The STUNT MAN attempts to explore the
grey area between illusion and reality.

Director Richard Rush displays innova-
tion and wry wit in the creation of his
multi- leveled frenetic, and taut plot
Peter O'Toole delivers an extraordinary
performance as the existentialist chorus to
Railback‘s paranoia.

Above all, this film has fun with itself —
a movie about movies,

deliver their message of need for
worldwide social, political and sexual

Casselberry and DuPree are high

Back to the Future

In the latest of a long list of Steven
Spielberg bubblegun dramas, Michael J.
Fox plays a high school student who drives
a modified DeLorean designed by this pro-
fessor with crazy hair into the past. There
he meets his unmarried parents and
changes history, risking the change that
they may never meet.

ls his mother's infatuation with her
future offspring an indication of Oedipal
strains in Spielberg’s personality? I don’t
know. I didn't see the movie, But Enter-
tainment Tonight liked it, as did alot of
people who paid Spielberg productions lots .
of money. Someone told me it was good,
though.

Directed by Robert Zemeckis

Streetwise

Documentary is an oiten ignored form of
cinema — sometimes wiui good reason.
The predominant stereotype of a documen-
tary is a low budget, crude, and heavy
handed treatment or a particular
director’s particular axe to grind. Never
theless, documentary can still be a power-
fully moving and, sometimes, artistically
beautiful form.

Like me Adacemy award winning THE
TIMES OF HARVEY MILK, STREET-
WISE (which was also nominated for ﬁle
1934 award) is an example of a documen-
tary that transcends the stereotype. In-
spired by a LIFE magazine photo essay,
STREETWISE explores a group of pimps,
prostitutes, an drug pushers — all of whom
are children _ living on the streets of Seat-
tle. While the subject matter alone is
unsettling, director Martin Bell is master-
ful in his ability to break down any bar-
riers between his camera and the subjects.
Bell captures the many nuances and
paradoxes of the street children’s tragedy
that a less sensitive observer might have
overlooked. Effective use of editing (nar»
rative flashbacks, for example) further
enhances this wedding of powerful subject
matter and skillful (though responsible)
artistry

STREETWISE is not casual Friday
night entertainment. Listening to a mother
describing her fourteen~yearrold
daughter's prostitution as “a passing
phase” is absolutely disturbing. STREET-
WISE undertakes nothing less than to ex-
pose the decay hidden beneath the
American dream
