women hoo

by George Mchmsey

For those of you who felt a
shiver run up your spine at about
6:45 last Tuesday evening as you
sat entrenched on the fourth floor
of Burling, and are at a loss to
explain it, read carefully. At ap~
proximately this same time in
Darby Gymnasium, senior
guard/co-captain Jessica Tofl was
shooting the winning lay»up of
the Pioneer Women's Basketball
team's game against Upper Iowa.
As the ball nestled sweetly in the
not, every warmeblooded
Grinncllian should have felt a
twinge of excrtement. The crowd
went nuts and if Cheech and
Chong had been there they would
have surcly jumped into a rcnrllr
tion of their famous "Basketball
Jones." Even announcer Dick

Vitale would httve been at a loss ,

for words -- well maybe not: "A .

real hum—dinger, baby, le'rne tell
you this teams‘ got some serious
'P.O.!"’ Forget potential Dicky,
This team is 5 and O!

Yep, you heard right, five
wins and, count'em, zero losses.
So what's going on? Could it
have something to do with the
fact that second year Coach Ted
Eskildsen tends to play ten to
fourteen of his players during the
course of a game'.7 Most likely.
Perhaps it has something to do
with the fact that the Pioneers
have thus far averaged 54 to their
opponents 37 in rebounds per
game? Good guess, but try this
one out for the finale: the Pio-
users are outscoring their oppo-

‘ncnts by a margin of twelve

points a ball game, which just
proves that if you score more
points, you wm more games.

Thus far the women have
steamrolled over Nebraska Wes-
leyan, Viterbo, Mt. St. Clare,
Elmhurst. and Upper Iowa. The
amount of talent shown by the
women in these games is
incredible. Can you say fast-
break, pinpoint passing and 17
foot jumpers? Just say Toft and
freshman guard Jenny Wood.
How about strong post-up moves
and ferocious rebounding? Junior
Laura Van Sickle, and freshman
Suellcn Hageman and Leigh

Grinnell‘s star center, Laura VanSickle (40), scores in
the Pioneer's thrilling, last second victory over Upper Iowa.
Coach Eskildsen‘s team is undefeated at 570.

Ashley fit that bill. You want
quick drives to the basket and soft
pull-up jumpers? Just look to
corcaptain Amy Johnson, Jen
Kern. and Jen Sprcmulli. Most
important of all, the Pioneer
bench has provided some instant
offense. tough defense, and erong
leadership which all adds up to,
well, . . 570? You bet.

The Pioneers will continue
to be tested until the Chistmas
Holidays and the road looks to be
rough. This time of year at
Grinnell, as you all know, is
tough. Weather‘s bad. readings
are long. papers are due and ﬁnals

are looming. It can thus become
a struggle to maintain that men-
tal toughness needed to play. But
this Pioneer women's team is
TOUGH and you better believe
they'll be playing some great
ball. "Everyonc's fulfilling her
role, and we're beginning to es-
tablish our consistency," Coach
E says. Tonight the rival Ko-
hawks of Coe College will slink
into town for a game at Darby at
7 pm. Everyone should be there
to cheer these women on for as
Coach E says, "This one looks to
be a bamAbumcr."

Women swimmers less than
impressive in debut performance

The Grinnell Pioneers
women's swim team opened their
season two weeks ago with a dual
meet against Washington
University and hosted the Pioneer
Relays on the following Satur-
day. Unfortunately, they were
defeated on both occasions, los»
ing to 115-85 against Wash U.
while placing fourth in the Pio-
ricer Relays behind Mankato
State, Northeast Missouri State

and Wash U.

Despite the setbacks, head
coach Sheila Cain was not disap—

were dominated by Mankato State
which is a Division II program,
with second place Northeast
Missouri from the Division II
ranks as well. Also. the battle
for second place went down to the
last event. the 400 freestyle relay,
before Northeast Missouri pulled

ahead of Wash U. and Grinnell.
Coach Cain said that the Divi-

were a good place to start. In the

Loss to Simpson evens
Pioneer's record at 2—2

by Bob Lifton

The Pioneers men‘s
basketball team's 86769 loss to
powerhouse Simpson lust Tues-
day cvcning brought Grinncll‘s
record to an even 2-2. While an
early .500 mark may not immer
diatcly impress many basketball
skeptics, it must be made clear
that the Pioneers have already
doubled ttll of last season‘s victo-
ries. What‘s more important, this
young squad will undoubtedly
improve as the season progresses.
Tho HW's" will take care of them-
selves.

Coach Westlund‘s team
opened the ’88789 year in dra-
mntic fashion with a last second
79778 victory at Lake Forest.
Freshman guard Stove Howland
burictl a nine-foot jumper with
six ticks left on the clock to cap
off an impressive performance by
Grinncll. Junior captain Mikc
Spurbcck paced the Pioneers with
17 points, followed closely by
sophomore BJ. lahn who
knocked in 11 in addition to his
13 rebounds.

Bcthel handed Grinncll its
first loss, downing the Pioneers
79-68 on Friday in Darby. The
Pioneers just couldn't get it to-
gether, shooting a far from rc-
spectablc 33% from the floor in
its home opener. Nonetheless,
they still managed to hang tough
the entire game with solid rc-
bounding and heads-up defense --
Lhc hounding Pioneer "d" forced
20 turnovcrs and scooped up 9
steals on the night. Jahn led the
team with 13 points and 11
boards. Freshmen Chris Jacob~
son and Howland added 11 apiece.
while Spurbcck canned 9 and
sophomore George Mchmsey
scored 7.

The Pioneers managed their
second Onorpoint victory of the

season on Saturday by edging
Buena Vista 8382. Sophomore
guard Holland Neal iced the game
with a thrccrpoint play with only
12 seconds rcmuining, pulling
Grinnell up 83-80. Jacobson led
the Pioneers with 18 points. The
6-8 center also pulled down 11
rebounds. Spurbcck piled in 15.
while Mclimscy and Neal added
11 each in the winning cause.

Tuesday‘s loss to Simpson
didn't exactly come down to the
wire. Whilc down by only ﬁve
at half, 3631, the Pioneers
couldn't contain the high-flying
boys from Simpson in the second
half. Then again, it's difficult to
say who could have.

The game was marred by
sloppy play in thc opening nto-
mans -- the score was knotted at
eight with more than four mine
utcs gone by -— as each team was
feeling the other out. Both
eventually settled down into their
respective grooves, and were able
to make their shots fall. With 10
minutes left in the half, sophor
more Dave Chamberlain hit a
lhrccrpointer to give the Pioneers
an 18—17 lead. This advantage
was rather short-lived, however,
as Simpson roared back with six
straight to go up 2348.

The teams sce-sawal back
and forth in the waning minutes
of the opening half. Jacobson
made his presence felt on both
ends of the court, pinning the
ball against the glass on defense
to snub an easy layup, and then
tipping in an errant jumper on
"0" to put Grinncll ahcttd 29-27.
Once again, this lead proved
ephemeral. Crisp passing and
some fast break baskets gave the
visitors the halftime edge.
