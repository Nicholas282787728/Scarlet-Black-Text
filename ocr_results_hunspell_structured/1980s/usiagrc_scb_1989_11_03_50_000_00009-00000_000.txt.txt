marily from Canier-Bresson, who
in the 1920’s and 30'sdeveloped the
technique which he termed "captur-
ing the decisive moment." This is
the style in which Madden‘s work is
done. The works give a feeling that
the viewer is seeing the subject of
the photograph for a frozen instant
The instant hangs and lengthens but
the sense of ﬂeeting impen-nanence
does not fade. The spontaneity of the
pieces remains clear and undiluted.

There is a real sense of life in these
photos. The bikers seem forever to
be hurrying to their destinations or
woliing down a quick lunch on the
go. The homeless photographs por-
tray, as well as any picture can, the
plight of so many people in our na-
tion’s capital, This series depicts not

deliberate. Each one has been care-
fully prepared in order to present a
rich sense of the subject’s personal-
ity. Doerschug's attention to techni-
cal detail produces a clean effect
which allows for an undistracted
viewing of the subject.

In a number of instances, Doerr
schug follows one subject, or a few
similar subjects, for a series of pho-
tographs. The effect is much like

sonality behind thephotograph.Each

are remarkable in that they portray

An itnportant aspeCt of Madden’s
homeless series are the quotes of the
homeless people she photographed.
This is an effective way ofrevealing
more about the individual subjects,
while atthe same time reminding us
that the people portrayed in the
photographs are very real.

Kevin Doerschug’s exhibit has a
different focus. He explains that
whereas Madden‘swork emphasizes
people, “Mine tend to be more rural
settings.”

“I tend to do serene things,” he
said.

Doerschug‘s photgraphs, taken
mostly around Grinnell, are mostly
portraits of animals and landscapes.
The photographs are studied and
