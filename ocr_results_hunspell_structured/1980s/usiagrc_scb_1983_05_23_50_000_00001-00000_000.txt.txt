The changing times: how do youdefine Grinnell
President Drake reflects on his four years

by Richard Letchtnger

“You‘re my Freshman class."

That's how George Drake termed what
is kind or a unique occurence: For this
year's seniors the end or tour years at
Gi'lnnell is also the end of Drake’s fourth
year as President or the college in other
words, what we've see take place at Grine
neil over the course of our college career
has also been viewed over the same exact
time span by a Grinnell alumn tclass of
19567 serving as President Taking advanr
tage otour status as Drake's lrosh. we ask
ed him to Sit down and evaluate, reflect,
and generally give us his leelmgs about
our college experience,

Drake, as you well know. is a modestand
Calm figure and he sets that tone from the
beginning of the Interview Responding to
an open ended question about what
changes he has noted during his term as
Pl'eSident he quickly responded with the
following disclaimer You'll find me
tumbling a bit on this, Drake asserted.
“because I'm not a person who drives ior
spectacular resultsi I’In satisfied with ma
cremental ones The (irst thing that has to
be Smd is that I Came to an excellent col-
lege and I think that it‘s still excellent, so
at least I haven't Caused us to lose
ground "

Getting down to thc speciiics Drake
cited the physical changes that have taken
place at Grinnell during his tenure as
president Explaining that he didn’t think
the campus was “as well maintained as it
should be," Drake stated that he is now
pleased Wlth its current condition.

The rennovation oi Hurling Library was
something that Drake did get excited over,
Drake said that this was one project that
he oversaw completely and that he ex-
pressed great pi-idc in ”l think the
building will serve the needs of Grinnell
students tor a good many generations,"
Drake said "It's one or the nicest librarys
to work in that I've seen "

Drake went on to explain that the com-
puter expansmn at Grinnell is simply a
response to a rapidly changing technology
and that they {the faculty and adinll’llstl‘éi'
tionl had no intention oi tipping the
balance in favor of the computer He smd
that there certainly would be no computer
mayor at Grinneli. but that they hoped to
Continue to keep it "Within the context Ol
liberal education "

But the physical changes are easy to talk
about. Many students reel that the greatest
changes to take place at Grinneli concern
the direction the college is taking. There is
a strong leeiing that Grinnell is becoming
too conservative. iorgetting its liberal arts
roots, and that we're becoming too
technical and computer oriented. The re-

cent stoan grant has also served to luel the
fire.

Drake acknowledged these feelings do
exist among some people but views them
irom a dillerent perspective "I can
understand how some people might tee'
thathiy, but I don tthink that‘s the ease,
Drake stated. Instead, Drake felt that
some oi the changes that have taken place
at Grinnell are simply what he labeled
”enlarging the scope or the college. our
sense of obligaiton to the students.”

He continued. "A college has to teet
some sense oi obligation to its students.
at should they be getting in their liberal
education7 thn I arrived at Grinneli

l was very impressed with the w ting pro
gram here, but it has seemed that quanr
tative learning has not been as carelully
attended to. The sloan grantgave us an ops
portunity to locus on this and tund the new
curriculum " Drake concluded. “I don't
think it's a change in direction lot the cola
lege's curl'tcululnl, now there will be other
skills to balance the writing skills, It‘s
clearlv an expansion oi Out' respon-

sibilities ”

 

 

 

“I draw some optomism—-l

from the experience of

the classes of the 30’s.

They graduacted into the

depths of the depression,

much worse than we’re

facing now.”

Moving away- lrom curricular issues
Drake responded to some questions about
the mood ot the campus Does he sense
that the student body is becoming more
conservative? "It's dangerous tor me to
speculate 7 students know better than I do
the mood of the students " Drake con-
tinued. “with that as a caveat, maybe the
students now are a bit more amenable to
accept the status quo than a few years ago.
i think it s largely because students a
worried about their opportunities in socier
ty — leeling that rather than concentrating
on changing the society. one better concenr
tratc on how you’re going to [it into it and
get a job ‘

Yet it was also interesting to note that
Drake recognized that there was still plan
ty of social awareness among the student
body. Citing the work oi the South Ali-ician
Support Group he seemed to say with sonic
excitement. "This stiident body. more
than most. is still capable ol interest in im-
portant national and international issucs
and considerablc portions can be mobilw:
ed into action "

Clearly Drake feels the times in \Vthh
students are graduating today are tough,
and because he too was once a graduating
Grinnell senior, he talked about some DI
the dil’lerelices between what he laced and
what we are facing

"My particular genci-atio was very lol‘r
tunale,” Drake explained ‘We re the
depression babies I was born in ism.
which i think was the lowest birthratc year
7 so there was an interesting eitecl

tsince there were lower numbers or cola
lege grads) there was lots or opportunity
out there i managed to go to graduate
school lor eight or nine years with good
iellowships all the way through when I
came out i didn't have any debt, and there
were lots ofjobs in the academic market "

But what oi the class ol 19337 Times are
not as good as they were when Drake was
graduating from Grinnell. what does he
feel will be lacing us and how does he think
we will taro? simply put. Drake is op-
tomistic

"I draw some optomism irom the ex
perience of the classes or the 30': They
graduated into the depths ol the depres
sion. much worse then we're lacing now.
Most or those people are doing ii ~
in a personal sense. in the way the
ducted their lives. and m a material
sense," Drake said what that says to me
is that armed with a Grinnell education a
person has a pretty good basis for meeting
the world out there and doing something
ivith it "

Drakc concluded. "Though the oppor»
tunitios may not be llourishing now as they
were [we to ton years ago there still are
opportunities right away they all adi-
know what they are, ()thr ai-crcr ape
prehensive and lrustratcd , the ma.
