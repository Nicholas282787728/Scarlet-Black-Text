Fire Marshall condemns Fine Arts basement
Remodeling provides chance to reorganize classrooms, offices

by Beth Vilen

Last January the Iowa Fire Marshall
issued citations claiming that temporary
partitions which currently section off the
basement oi the Fine Arts Building present
a fire hazard. The inaccessibility of the cen-
tral portion oi the building was also cited as
a hazard. In order to bring the basement up
to tire saiety standards. plans are now
underway to remove the temporary parti-
tions and replace them with more perma~
nent structures next summer. A new exit
may also be included in the renovation
plans.

The temporary partitions were criticized
because they are made of exposed wood
which could burn quickly. The partitions
also have air spaces above and below them
which increases circulation, and would also
allow a fire to spread rapidly.

According to Waldo Walker, executive
vice-president of me college, the Fire Mar-
shall's Office has allowed the college “a
period of response" in which to iormulate
plans to correct the problems. These plans
are still in an early stage, however, since
the space needs oi the theatre, art and
music departments must be evaluated
belore any design can be drawn up. Conser
quenuy, a committee consisting or Louis
Zirkle, chairman of the art department,
John Jensen, chairman of the music

department, .ian,Czechowski, chairman oi
the theatre department and Sandy Moiiett,
professor oi theatre, has been discussing
what changes should be made in order to
meet the needs oi all the departments,

Mortar Board promotes coffee hours, “Review”

The aim of the committee is to make the
entire Fine Arts Building more functional
This means some rooms in the upper floors
oi the building may be designated ior pur-
poses other than they now serve and some
rooms constructed in the new basement
may be used for needs which are currently
met by upstairs rooms. Walker said that
the plans are also likely to include a
“humidity and environment controlled art
storage facility."

Since the theatre department is currently
located almost entirely in the basement, it
will be the department most affected by the
changes. According to Czechowski, the
committee would like to have all of the
faculty offices on the first floor in orderto
increase communication between the
departments Czechowski also said that
any changes made will have to accom-
modate dressing rooms, a costume shop,
storage for props and sets and classrooms
since these are currently located in the
basement

In late October when specific space needs
for each of the departments have been
decided, the committee will take their pron
posals to Dale Hawn, director oi the
Physical Plant. Hawn will then consult with
an architect and tentative plans will be
drawn up. When theseplans have been ap-
proved by the Flre Marshall, they will go
before the Board of Trustees, which will
allocate funds ior the project, No cost

Paint, study niches, chairs
changed at Burling

“Not a particularly nice place to study”

by Melissa Klagle

While Burling Library may be conve»
nient, it is not, according to Librarian of the
College Christopher McKee, a particularly
nice place to study. This is because the
library was built in die intemational style
oi architecture which emphaSIzes funCr
tional rather than beautiful design. The
aim of the library renovations is to make
die library more condusive to studying
while retaining its functional value.

There are a number of changes being
planned to accomplish this without
rebuilding the entire library. First, the
cellar of the library will be changed from
its present sterile white to a warmer set of
earthtones. Additional Carrels and other
small study niches will also be added dur
ing the renovation to help create “a nicer
ambience," stated McKee.

Another change in the library will be the
replacement or the present chairs. McKee
is asking for student opinions about the five
types oi chairs to help him make the iinal
decision. The chairs, which are located

near the amoeba table, are ‘labeled and
there is a form available for comments
Each chair has merits and drawbacks.
These will be taken into consideration with
the students' opinions when a final decision
is made. No deadline has been set for mak-
ing this decision

Chair “A” is inexpensive but it it “looks
like it belongs in a doctor's Office," accorr
ding to McKee. Chair “C" is very comior
table and has been a great success in the
Williams College Library but the arms
don't fit under the tables in Burling. Chair
“Q" is McKee's favorite. This model has
been serving the Luther College Library [or
12 years without a single maintenance pro-
blem; its a comfortable and sturdy Chair.
Both models ”X" which is now on display
and “5" which had not arrived at press
time, are upholstered chairs that, while
they are comfortable and look good, re
quire a lot of maintenance because the
upholstery wears out quickly.
