New system eases sub-finding

Since last semester, Ryan Felton ’07, a two-year student em-
ployee rn the PRC, has seldom worried when her job srood in
the way ofan unexpected commitment. She just logs in to the
Grinnell Substitution System (GSS), A few anlISCTClleS later,
her supervisor and all cesworkcrs know that she needs a sub. “1
love it so much,"Felton said, “It's so easy.”

Felttin rs one of the many student workers who have hen.
eilted from the G58, an electronic work substitution system
currently running in the PEC and Grinnell Phonarhon. In the
PEC alone,55 ofthe 65 sub requests made on GSS wele ﬁlled
the first two months of this semester.

Students using the system can access their work schedule
and select the time slot they need ﬁllcdrAn eemall notiﬁcation
‘ol’the request is then sent to the supervisor and coworkers. Use
crs can accepr the shift by clicking on a link in the e»mall.

(355 was ﬁrst designed as a Software Design class project
by three students, Chayapan Khannabha ’08, Eric Booking ’07

and Jingsheng Wang ’02, who is also rhe business manager for
the Sid/3, Aftei the class, Wang and Jiazhen Chen ’07 contins
rred developing the program and pcrsuaded the PEG and the
l>honathorr to adopt it.

Chen said one motivation was to impiove on the old system
ofposting rccn slips on a wall Iryou want to and something
for Sunday afternoon, it takes so much time to find the exact
position,” he said.

Many workers rrr orhcr departments resort to mass emails
to find subs.“1 like rho [fact that] people are creative when they
send their sub request, but it gets a lrttlc annoying,"said Fclron,
who also works in the dining hall.

Wang and Chen are optimistic abour the future of their
program, and hope other departments adopt it. “You’ve got a
date. a concert to attend you want to find subs," Chen said.
“[GSS]'§ a great tool because it saves cverybody’s time."

Council trains first year leaders

All Grinnell ﬁrst years are required to take an academic
Tutorial to introduce them to the intellectual life ofa liberal
arts college. Until this semester, rhorrgh, first—yams had no such
option to introduce them to a leadership role on campus.

Last spring, Matt Clcinman ’06, Maggie Porthotr'os and
Megan Goering’os,wlro is also a writer for the scam, developed
FrrstrYear Councrl as a way to get firstryears involved in SGA.
VVlth ﬁrst-semestel ﬁrst—years excluded fiom Joint Board, Go-
eriiig said many interested students never got involved with
SGA. “The problem was rhar by second semester, hrstryenrs
were already involved in other activrties so they didn’t have time
to be a senator,“she said. '

First year Carlos Lu ’10 got involved otter hearing about
First Year Council at the NSC activities fair. “Since we can't
run for senators, this group wtll help those that want to be-
come senators to get a better understanding ot’what SGA is all
about,” said Lu.

Members ofl7irst Year Council learn about the inner works
ings of SGA, “We get to learn how to throw parties, start or—

ganizations, be put on committees and lust get to know more
about SGA, ’sald Mairead O Grady' 10. ‘You realize how mlleh
money Grinnell has and how much potential rt has to do cool
things.”

One major goal ofthe FII‘SITYBM Council is to put out a stu-
dent publication for the incoming ﬁrst-year classrAleX schecrer
’10 said them is a need for advice from students The publicas
tion “would contain general things around campus, just a krnd
otgec to know you guide put rogerhcr by students as opposed
to by the administration," Schecter said. ”Vl’e want something
that’s from the students‘ perspective.”

Since the original conception of l-‘rrseYear Council as an
SGA stepping stone, it has evolved into a vehicle to learn about
orher activities at Grinnell, like community service and :lctiv-
ism. “We broadened the goal to foster leadership in a wider
sense rather than solely SGA,"Goering said,

The First-Year Council meers every Tuesday at 7 pm. in
JRC 226, and is open to all members of the class of2010.
