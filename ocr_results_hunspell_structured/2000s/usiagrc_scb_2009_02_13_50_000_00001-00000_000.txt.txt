SGA on campus climate

iiv DAVID LOGAN

Before VVedncsday’s regular joint Board meeting, SGA
Cabinet executives deliveied a 20-minute presentation on
the current campus climate.The presentation, similar to the
one given before Trustees last weekend, addressed concerns
over the current campus climate and perceptions of growing
distrust among facultv students and administrators.

The subject and tone of the presentation which was der
liver-ed before an audience of approximatclv on students in
JRC 101, were sobering as Cabinet members described the
current state oftlie College and relations between its various
Communltlcs as a "crisis."

“What's the cris‘ " asked SGA President Nco Morakc
’09 at the beginning ofrhe presentation. “We have a broken
community.”

Cabinet members sought to provide a comprehensive
overview of“thc current campus climate," Morakc said dur-
ing the presentation. “We feel that it is necessary to confront
the very issues that are breaking down our sense of comr
munity."

The presentation ﬁrst turned to the ongoing dispute bet
tween some faculty members and members of the adminisr
tration which erupted following the contentious dcparrurc
of Sheree Andrews, f or associate dean and director of
Residence Life. According to Motakc, studcilts had been
thrust into an uncomfortable position in navigating relations
between faculty and stair.

“Students aic stiuctuially placed' in the middle ofa d ~
pute between l'acultv and Student Affairs," blotakc s..ritl
“SGA has heard many of their coilcuins, some including that
students have felt uncomfortable at the ptrctption that they
were being used as pawns And to us perception is reality "

in addition to students' position relative to faculty and
staff, the presentation highlighted a perceived lack of trans-
potency and opennc . among both the College's professors
and administrators.

“We fccl like [students have] been sort of disenfian—
clliscd ill a way iind cut out of our rolc in Student Affairs
dcci tin—making," said SGA Vicc l’rcsidcrlt for Student All

av SARAH BLACK

After nearly a year of organizing student activists and col-
laborating with administrators, next month a new program will
take the ﬁrst step toward creating a more just campus.

During spring Break, Mar 14 to 17, the student group A
Just Grirrnell will hold a free workshop aimed at hrcilrtnting
discussions about oppression and privilege in Grinnell. Pare
ticipants will go on to develop a permanent program to enable
such dialogue throughout the community on an ongoing basis.

The workshop will feature three days with a workshop froth
itator from the Social Justice Training institute, Kathy Cheat.
According to organizer Leah Krandcl'09, the frrsr few days will
bc spent deﬁning social justice and its relevance to campus lit
along with training scssions.Thc final day will consist of“tullr
ing about how we 5c: a peer education program coming to
gCll‘le," l(.tandel said.

Feedback from the workshop and a Ploneel‘web survey will
be used to mate a pilot progiam this spti a as a model for

“Over the summer we were talking and felt that there need-
ed to be something that was institutionalized," Krandel said.
“And that we shouldn't just be talking about LBGT issues he-
cause there are a lot ofothct ways that people are disadvantaged
and privileged on this campus."

Pcrbix said that the organization saw a need on campus

for a common forum
to present social justice
concerns. "instead ofrc»
lying on student groups
to fill that vacuum, this
is a picture where every
one has etperience of
having dialogue," Peron
said, “We will probably
eventually find a home
in student/1ft rs,"

similar projects in the past.
