Coach defends his player, system Long-time

This response is being sent to those who may like to know
a little more about my basketball strategy. Piltt ofour ‘Systcm’
is creating a phrenctic playing pace that wears opponents down
after forty minutes. Each year I designate one player as a ‘rab-
bit'. whose job is to force the actionl tell this person at the
start of the year that they will not be a high percentage shooter
because they will be responsible for taking the majority of our
forced shots. Steve Wood occupied this role a couple ofyears
ago. jefl’Clcment assrrmed this position in the late 90s. It is not
an enviable role as you can look selfish when you are having a
particularly off night.

At the start of this season,l risked John Grotbetg to take
on this role. I asked John because he is the most talented player
on out squad and the player who best has the ability to create a
quick shot. I told him that his shooting percentage would suffer
and that. while I knew he was capable ofberng a .500 field goal
percentage shootei, that this role iequiied him to shoot more
frequently and he would he doing well to shoot .350 from the
ﬂoor. John said that he would do whatever I thought was best

[or the team and we moved foi‘waid.

Onc of the benefits of placing such a responsibility on
a single player is that because these individuals can put
up gmudy numbers when they are shooting well, opposing
coaches have to devise schemes to limit the damage they can
inflict. A classic case of how our team has been able to take
advantage of these game plans occurred [lils past weekend.
As opposing coaches focus more intently on stopping a key
player, other players become that much more opcn.This year
we have a number ofindiViduals who, given time, can make
an opponent pay for overly helping out on John Grotbeig.

Now, to anyone who wants to comment about my coach—
ing plrilospoplryl believe I arti fair game. But as far as to how
my players play the game, please be aware that they are only
doing whatI am asking them to do.

Call to action against war in Iraq

The “Occupation Project” is a national campaign of sus~
taincd nonviolent civil disobedience designed to end Iraq war-
funding. I will be in Des Moines outside the Federal Building
on February 8 when the campaign in central Iowa kicks offin
the form ofa rally and press conici-cnce,

During the following eight weeks, up to and including _

Spirng Break, small affinity groups are encouraged to make
visits to offices of members of congress to demand they vote
against funding the wai/ occupation in Iraq. Those visits may
include creative nonviolent means to communicate this po
tion, and visitors may choose to stay or “sit in" until i-eptescntae
tivcs agree to stop funding this illegal, immoral, criminal, insane
war.

Return visits are hcing planned to the Des Moines offices
of Senator Grassley and Representative Boswell, where I was
amongst petitioners arrested in September. Representative
stove King's office in Creston will also be visited and possibly
local offices ofother members orowa's congressional delega-
tion.

The great majoiity of people no longer suppoit this war.
we all support the troops. It is insane to think anyone does
not love and support the people who have volunteered to serve
this country. They have sworn to preserve and protect our land
aild our libel-tics, Unfominately, we all know that lies and miSr
guided policrcs took us into this undeclared and unnecessary
war in Iraq,

Representative Ron Paul of Texas said on January 18,
“Keeping our troops out of harms way, especially when war is
unnecessary, is never unpatriotic.Theie’s no better way to sup-
port the troops . Rest assured one can be p1lrlotlc1nd truly
support the troops by denying fonds to perpetuate and spread

this ill-advised war."

On February 3-Tcm Vilsack called for an immediate end to
financing for the war in Iraq He said, “Congress has the com
strtutional responsibility and a moral obligation to do it now.
Those who voted for the war, those who voted to continue to
support the war, those who voted to continue funding the war,
can surely vote to stop the war.”

Additional congressional funding is not needed so our
troops can aim and defend themselves today and tomorrow
And the Department ochfense has plenty of money to more
troops anywhere on earth — including home

Since ive are all complicit in this illegal war. please join me
in insisting that congress stop thc war funding. Only then can
we begin to repair the damage we have done in Iraq, ensure
the health and welfare of returning veterans, and tend to out
numerous needs here at home.

This national campaign that will continue through the
and of March was initiated by Voices foi Creative Nonvio-
lence (wwwvcnvorg), and endorsed by several national cigar
nizations, including; CODEPINK (wwwcodcpinkspcaccnrg),
veterans for Peace (wwwverernnsforpcaceor-g), Declaration of
Peace, and the Global Network Against Weapons 8:, Nuclear
Power in space.

Local organizers and sponsors include: Catholic Peace
A ’ stry (Brian Tericll tciiellcpm@yiihoo. com) the Iowa
Peace Netwmk. and the Des Moines Catholic Woikcr (Flank

responds to
column

The difference between an “opinion" and an "informed
opinion"is, ofcoutsc, good research and observation. In his
most recent article concerning the skills of one Grinnell
basketball player vs another, it seems that Mark Japinga
failed to do much of the latter. Perhaps he should have has
gun by interviewing coach Arseneault as did Dan Hardin
in his fine article about Keith Chamberlain. Had Japinga
done so, he might have discovered that Grotherg is felt
lowing instructions when he takes his shift on the court.

He might also discover that Schmidt spends almost
no tinre on the same shift as Grotboi-g, and that Langcn-
hair is spending less time on the same line with him than
he did earlier in the season. IfGrotberg is not getting the
ball to these two fine shooters are we to expect him to
throw passes to them from his position on the bench?

He might also considei how difﬁcult it is to shoot
while being double and triple teamed Concurrently, it
seems to escape Japinga that it is just as difﬁcult to comr
plctc passes while in this situation. With bettor observar
tian he might also have noticed how Grotberg's ability to
draw defenders frees up others in the rotation.

Those of us who have followed Griiinell basketball for
years (over 50 in my case) continue to be in awc'of Grotr
hctg's fluidity on the court.I personally am amazed at his
ability to perform in clutch situations. His “throwing up
crap" performance against Lawrence actually helped show
his teammates ti mindset that could lead to winning the
ch championship. These traits don’t show up in the
statistics cited in the article,but as any good Grinncll stu—
dent knows, it is very easy to make any point-no matter
how invalid- by manipulating statistics.

I do agree that Dave Arseneaulr should get just as
much credit and feel that Arscneault' is more than deserv-
ing of the Coiisy Award Noin' 'on he received lastweek
as one of the host point guards in all three divisions of
NCAA basketball. I just don't understand why Mr. Japr
inga would want to give accolades to one teammate while
berating another.

I like my six year old Gmndsoti’s~take on this team
the best of all. When asked who his favorite was, he said.
“Keith is the best! He giabs the ball away."

“Really?"l replied. “Yeah, and Bobby is the besr! He’s
fast! And, and Mike is the best! He can shoot! And Davey
is the best! He likes to go in and pass and dribble and
shoot! And John is the best! Ht: goes everywhere! And
Ahmad is the bestl He can jump really high!”

I have much more respect for my grandson's informed
opinion the has seen WAY more Gr-inncll games in his six
years than Iaping a has in his 1 1/2 year tenure) In Grand
sons eyes. no one gets an unjustified thrashing and every
one gets the accolades they deserve. By the way Grande
son gave a few pointers for' Keith, Mondo and Ahmed in
oncrﬁngci‘cd dribbling. He was allowed to express these
informed opinions because he actually plays the game in
the Des Moines City Youth League.
