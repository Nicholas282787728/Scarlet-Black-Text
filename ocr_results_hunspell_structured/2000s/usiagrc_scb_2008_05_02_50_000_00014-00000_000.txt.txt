Childhood regrets and old hippie glasses galore

Rachel Fields ’09 talks about her childhood education, style and how the class of 2008 will be missed

When I was nine, my family moved
to the United states from England,
leaving belnnd a lot of questionable
relatives and a rabbit that later died in
an incident with a chainsaw. Due to
their increased
brainpower
and awesome—
ness, English
children start
school a year
earlier than
Americans, so I went straight into
fifth grade when 1 was nine,

1 had dreams- oflvlnnliig over my
American fiiends and beeontrng caps
tam orthc iitth grade dance team, but
I was a boyish lie-year-old with a
bowl cut and a sr age accent, and my
favorite outfit was a denim burrow
down shirt.

We moved to the US around
Christinastimc, and I remember tryr
ing to ﬁt in with my new American
classmates by saying the equivalent of,
“Arc you going to leave milk and cook-
ies for Santa Claus?"

Uiifmtunately, the Britrsh “eqrrivar
lent" is something along the lines of,
“Are you goitrg to leave biscuits and
shorty for Fathei Christmas?”

Needless to say, it was going to be

two long years

After a few

painful years of
social humiliation and people calling
me “Pumpkin" (a still unsolved mys-
tery), my parents decided to switch
school districts and let me do , -th
grade agarn. "No, no, her grades we
fine,”l imagine them saying to otir
new neighbors. “She was just too sor
cially awkward to be allowed out rtr
public."

I repeated sixth grade rvith pretty
much the same level of soual EUC’
eess, probably due to the fact that the
denim buttonrdown shirt had not yet
been discarded.

I never thought about my grade-

r-cpeating adventures until recently,
when I looked around at my group of
fiiends (unfortunately foi me, all scr
niois) and thought about a senior year
without them.

When they go on into the real
world to do real work and have real
problems, I’ll still be here, presumably
prerpartying by myself and snapping
rrp lonely, awkward iirstryears.

In lrgitr of this, I can't help cursing
my fifth grade self for her debilitating
social ineptitude.

“Conic on,
Raclicll" I say
despr ingly. “At
least take off your
old man hippie

away tliosc sweats

But I have
not yet acquired a

same: the people I love are graduatr

Students should know all of trustees’ functions

Danny Haupt ’08 opines that students should be kept informed about trustee activity and partake in it

Grinnell we have a tendency to bitch on a pretty
regular basis about pretty much everything. Some of
the loudest and most frequent complaints are often
about the college, itself, and the perceived failures of
administrators and tiustees to listen to students. But
when the trustees presented themselves lastThursday
to talk to students, not too many showed up.

Many would question the point orattending these
meetings, arguing that trustees are often unresponsive
to student concerns or chronically out of touch with
student opinion.

I can‘t speak for trustees, but I imagine it is also
frustrating to hear criticisms from students who are
often unaware of the trustees' decisions and what they
actually do tor the college.

What we as students need is more detailed knowlr
edge about the trustees’ role in guiding Grinncll and
their decision making. It provided, students could
meet trustees halfway to engage in more constiuctive
dialogue.

Before we as students can com-
municate with and persuade trust-
ees, we need to know what they do
and what power they have to make
changes at Grinnell.

The trustees’otﬁcial website sug—
gests their role is to assure the “great
and lasting good" of Grinnell col-
lege. Beyond this statement and brief
explanations of the various committees trustees serve
on, there is little to inform a student about what type
ofdecismns trustees actually make for the college.

The only information readily available about

What we asstaderlts neeoismore
detailed knowledge about the
Trustees’ role in guiding Grihnell
and than derision-making.

trustees comes from summaries of their triannual
meetings on their website. The summary provides a
review of the issues discussed, dcusions made, and
events attended by the trustees.

The summary of meetings in February consisted
ota page and provided statements like “The Board
amended its Investment
Policy,"but never clariﬁed
what the amendments
were and why they were
made. Even ifiiivestincnt
policy is private, all of the
summations were pretty
vague and mention that
issues such as “faculty tccruitmeiit”were discussed but
never elaborate what the substance of the debate was.

Because these summations aren't very helptul, stu-
dents can only get info about trustees from Clcctcd
members of SGA cabinet, who attend 90 percent of
trustee meetings

Student Goveinmeiit could
play a better role in providing
information about trustee meet-
ings, But sorts job is to repre»
sent student opinion and then
provide the reaction from trustees
to the student body. SGA isn’t re,
sponsible for the actual decisions
the trustees make, nor were they
elected to he messengers. Ultimately, it is the respon-
sibility otthose who do make decisions for the college
to explaru and detend them.

I hate using the phrase “shareholder" to describe

Dann Haupt’08
Ont eWay Out

myselfas a student at Grinnell, but I think it is useful
when describing my relation to the trustees. We all
invest or at least indcht ourselves to invest in Griiiiiell,
and as a consequence have a right to lcnow more about
the decisions are being made tor the college in the
present and in the long run.

To be clear. at the be
ginning of this article I
noted that most students
would probably argue
that the trustees are unre-
sponsive to our concerns.
I don't think this is true.
Based on my experiences
rnteractrng with them, I believe they have a great has
terest in student opinion and enjoy interactions with
us.

But without more accessible information about
the trustees and their decisions, students will always
be at a perpetual disadvantage to articulate their con-
cerns to the trustees,

Icaii’t say that we will stop being too apathetic to
attend ttrrstee meetings. I doubt we will stop whining
about subjects over which the trustees have no cons
trol,

But. if the trustees could e-mail minutes from
their meetings or provide a more detailed description
of what the trustees do on their websites, everyone
corrld benefit. such information could go a long way
to racrlrtatrng better rnteractions with the trustees and
empower students to affect even greater change at
Grinnell.
