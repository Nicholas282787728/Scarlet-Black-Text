College starts new
probation policy

BYPETERHENRY5LHARSHA SEKAR

The college recently instituted a new level of academic
censure called “strict academic probation." The new classiﬁca-
tion, which is more severe than either a warning or placement
on regular probation, would restrict students in “bad ' :idemic
starrdrng"i’rorn partieipatrng in eompetrtive NCAA matchesir
a student on a strict probation does compete in any events, then
tliit students team risks dis udliflcation by the NCAA

The Chilngk in policy, which has been in effect since Oct
what 31, 2007, originated from :i Grinnell Academic Affairs
review of NCAA rules. The NCAA Division III manual re-
quires that all student athletes “shall be enrolled in at least a
minimum fullstime program of studies, be in good academic
standing and maintain satisfactory progress toward a baccalau-
reate or equivalent degree."

While each college or university must generally follow these
guidehnes, the NCAA does not have any specific definition of
“good academic standing," Vice President ofAcadcmic Affairs
Jim Swan—z said that the college has broad discretion in estab-
lishing such guidelines. “How we decide on what rs good near
demic standing is up to us," Shwart? aid. “lint the her that we
have to say that athletes are in good academic standing conrcs
from the NCAA."

In 2006, the Committee on Academic Standing and the
Athletic Department began examining how the college's a
demic policrcs rnet NCAA requirements, which Associate
Dean Jonathan Chenette said seemed inadequate. Formally,
anybody whow1s on campus happened to be in guori academic
standing,“ s1id Chenettc. That seemed to not take fully serir
ously our charge to define what good academic standing means.
We felt that was too liberal ufa stance to take.”

Undci the old policy. the Grinnell College defined being in
“good academic standing" as simply not being suspended and

Pride Week: Queer and delightful

Week—long commemoration seeks to educate, celebrate, with series of
movies, talks, Gay Bake Night, BBQtleer and Pride Parade

ili'ALi SARGENT

srnee he ilrrivctl on campus two weeks ago, the new Vice
tlent for student Arrairs, Houston Doughatty has paid
vrsrts to the dining hall, meetings with SGA .rnd even the Dist
co I'liiriis Party But last Friday, Dougharty saw something so
impressive he sard it gave hrm trouble sleepingitlre drag show.
“l‘ve seen lots of drag shows ny r to, but that was one or
the most creative and energetic shows i'vc ever been to,” said
Dougharty. “I thought it gave a wonderful

queel-uffirmlng vibe to the campus."

The drag show, organized by members
of Qicer People of Color (CLFOC) to raise
money for a Minneapolis-based otgilniz'dv
tion that provides a safe space for teens in
the twin erties, kicked off this year's annual
Pride Week, a week ofactivities intended to
raise awareness of and pioinote solidarity
with the queer community. The week fear
tures a number of events including a Ga
Bake Night, BBQlccr and, the corrcirrsion
oftlic week, a pride parade.

Since the drag show began two years
ago, it has grown bigger and bigger, and srrrdents say that thrs
semestcr‘s show was no exception. “A lot of whill was really
amazing was the dedication people |liid,”said Laure Franco '09.
Franco, one of the shows nrgdnizcrs, said that student groups
had been practicing several hours a week in preparation for Frir
day.

in addition to the level orpreparation, organizers also said
that the number orptrtieipants was impressive and that there
were “a lot ofpeople involved outside orthe queer community,
which is what I was going tor,"sruti Erin Durdn'O‘), spokesper-
son lor (Lucer People of Color.

”Gr/nne/l has been out and

\Vliile Pl'ldC \\’cek is an annual nationwide celebration
observed .it Gtinncll. in light of the recent hdtc ctimcs on
campus, this year's Pride Week has been given extra thought
and pliinningiinvnlving the majority oi‘ organizations on
c:\tt\pus.“Grinncl.l has been out and proud a lot longer than
most campuses have" stud Doughartr, “1 think we're in an area
orneeding to reeemphasrze the import. to ofptide."

“I think National Coming Out Vl’cek' in the fall and Pride
\Vcelt rn the spring are critical days ofcelchrar
tion tor any college campus, srid Dougharty
“Especially at a place like Grinneil that is so
afﬁrming in diversity.”

France said that the nntisqueer vandal-
ism and marlings that happened betore spring
bre rk this semester in some ways strengthened
the efforts otstudenrs to organize One ofmy
personal goals was iust to show that the com-
munity and the college cdmpus are still going
strong,” said Franco. “The hate errmes did
nothing to intimidate us, Ifanything, we came
back 20 times lurdcr,"

Duran agreed “There was a communlr)
sense or‘lct‘s do pride even bigger no\v,‘" she said.

Tlicre still remained somL LonLctn among students about
safcn' lictivitiLs, particulailii at the ding show because of thL
srze ot the event organizers ultimately decided that canceling
would send the wrong message but srrli denied to trke precau»
tions. We definitely got a lot more hrrdcorc about security,
said Duran. Saturday's pride parade will be led by a security
truck.

Tire level orsupporr apparent in the march and forums sev-
eral months ago was particularly evident this week. Numerous
student groups participated in Pride week aetrvrtres, including
