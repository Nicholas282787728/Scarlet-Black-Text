But after 23 yezus, this is Meyer’s last as head of Rosenﬁeld,
and Sarah Purcell "92, History, will become drtector beginning
next year, Meyer has been postponing a sabbatical for more than
two years. “I did not want to postpone my sabbatreal any longer,"
said Moyet,“1 am or; right now. and (0 leave for a year and come
back for only two more did not make much sense."

The Rosenﬁeld Program, started in 1979, brings numerous
speakers on politics to campus each year in addition to providing
ﬁnances for rntemshrps, awards and events.

The symposia hosted by the program have become an intris
cate part or the Grinnell learning experience, ”VVc can get the
campus community engaged in that issue," said Moyer. ”Some-
times that can lead to courses or, like the Attic Symposium, be
combined with courses.”

Upon taking the position. Moyer began teaching halftime

his time allocated to the program, directing it was noreasy.

When Mayer ﬁrst came tnlo ofﬁce, the program had very lit-
tle money compared to its
current 51 million endow-
ment. Even with limited
msollrces, the program was
able to strcccssnrlly bring in
many prornincnt acadcm-
ics and public figures. Un-
der Moycr's leadership, the
Rosenﬁeld Program has
covered toprcs and speakers
rangrng from Madeline Alt
brrght and Cesar Chavez to the struggle for Peace in the Middle
East,

The program's success was dependent on the flexibility it had
in bringing in speakers and condrrctrng 5ymposia."Thc Rosenﬁeld
program is run by committee thats halfstudcnts and lralrracrrlty,"
said Moyer. “We don't have to go through all this rigmarole like

"He is an incredible Inclllor to me."

Even though next year the program wrll no longer be rn lVloy~

strong tradrtion when Purcell beeorncs director. “1 think she will
do nicely," he sard.
