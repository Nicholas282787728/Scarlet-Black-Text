The daily grind of another fall semester has begun and
has some people wishing for an escape. But all hope is
not lost. An astounding Indie-band is sweeping into
town in a matter of days to temporarily save your sanity.
Cursive’: music weaves together bitter guitar melodies
and angst-ridden vocals. While often harsh, Cursive tunes
express a sweet heart-rending melancholy that is
ampliﬁed by beautiful cello—playing. Their lyrics usually
involve emotionally corrupted love-hate relationships.
This might sound like a recipe for an emu disaster but
Cursive does an admirable jab oi avoiding clichés. Their
songs include poetic imagery and unusual ideas in lines
like "The night has fallen down the staircase," and “(our
tears are only allbis,” The band has released six rull~
length CD5, including The Ugly Organ, nonrestrru, and
Semantics Ufa Sermon.

in concert, Cursive keeps up a high energy and high
quality performance. Unlike bands who rely on computer
alteiatioii to pump up their albums, Cursive concerts
sound equally impressive live and on CD. They sound
great without a digital makeover, and sarcastic commenu
from the lead singer can deﬁnitely be entertaining.
Cursive hails from Omaha, Nebr. The band started up in
1995 as the brainchild of Tim Kasher (vocals, guitar).
Matt Magirin (bass, vocals) and Steve Pederson (guitar,
vocals), and later expanded to include Gretta cohri (cello)
and clintsdrnase (drums).
