Students celebrate the ’tFadition'of Quinceaﬁera

Student Organization of Latinos/Latinas bring a time-honored celebration to the wider Grinnell community

BY KATHERlNE CHUNG

While watching7 MTV shows about er
travagent coming-of—age celebrations. the
meaning ofa Chrinceariera can be lost in the
clutter of prime-time. However, the cultural
and historical importance ofthe event is not
reﬂected by an MTVrstyle outrageous party.

Last Saturday in Harris Center, Student
Organization of Latinos/Latinas (SOL),
presented the Grinnell Community with
this important tradition—a coming-of—age
celebration that recognizes and honors a
young woman’s passage from childhood to’
adulthood at the age of 15.

"Qiincearieras are a really imr
portant facet of becoming an adult
in Hispanic culture particularly if
you're a young lady," said Graciela
Guzman '11, who organized the
event. “Because half of that event is
a celebration and we thought, here’s
a great opportunity to incorporate
a Grinnell aspect, which is Har-
ris, give it a context, and still
have fun.’

The event presented the
different traditions and
information regarding
Qiincear‘iera celebrations,

. in addition to providing

food, music, a photo booth
and a make-your—own re-
cuerdos—mementos—
booth.

Since the Qiinceaﬁera
was a new event at Grinnell College, SOL

faced some challenges in planning, such as

how to best depict a Qrinceaﬁera.There was
a danger ofmaking a mockery ofa cherished
ceremony if the event‘s festivities overlooked
cultural signiﬁcance.

“Before they had started the presentae
tion they asked people if they’ve been to a
miinceai'iera or knew what it was and ma»

jority of the people [said they] didn’t know
what it was,” said l—lnrpreet Singh '12, who
attended the event. “I think it's really impor
tant that SOL is doing this so they can bring
Latino culture for more integration of the
different cultures on campus." .

Originally, a milnceanera began as a
Catholic ritual involving a mass or a blessing
in the church, Today, (Alinceaiiera celebrar
tions can vary greatly in practice.

"Qiincearieras range from very personal
backyard BBQwith close family [to spend-
ing] hundreds of thousands of dollars like

you see on MTV that’s kind ofinﬂuenced
how people see minceaneras,” said
Gustavo Arambula ’10, one of the or»
ganizers of the event. “It’s become this
pan—Latino concoction, tradition, that
everyone celebrates. It’s very much inn
fused with U.S. consumerism but a lot
ofpeople still stick to the traditional

aspect of it." '
one of the goals of sons
Quinceanera was to debunk
popular notion ofa Quincea
item as an extravagant pare
lyias seen in MTV Tr3s’s
“Quiero Mis Qiinces"—
by emphasizing the tra-
ditions of the event. A
Chaincear’iera is a pro-
cess that requires ex*
tensive preparation, not
just organizationally,
but also mentally, accord-

ing to Guzman.

“You have all these adults who are telling
you, be ultra-religious, follow this path, or
this is what a young lady should do, [and]
you kind ofget to pick a little bit ofwhat you
want to take and create yourself,” Guzman
said. "It’s the process of molding yourself
and I think that’s what makes it so special."

Guzman recalled her own Quinceanera,

which was a simple affair without the ostens
tation ofthe media's portrayal ofa (luinter
nera.

“My family is ultra Catholic so we had
a traditional mass and I had a really small
gathering with my family and we just had
lunch and that was it," Guzman said. “For

me the most important part of it was my‘

transition through my faith and it was very
evident through what was focused on and
what wasn't, with the biggest part [being]
the Mass."

Though chrinceaneras do vary from per-
son to person, Arambula pointed out that
the gendered nature of the event's traditions
can be seen as problematic. “For a Qiinceae
nera, traditionally, the mainceaﬁeraithe

girlihas to wear a dress,“Arambula said. “It
has to be puffy, like gender representation,
and you have to wear makeup. Sometimes
the father, when [the girl] comes into the
party and she’s wearing ﬂats, [he] changes
her shoes into high heels and it symbolizes
womanhood.” .

Guzman emphasized the importance of
understanding the complex social milieus
that shape each minceaaera.

"I hope people understand that traditions
are multi-faceted things," Guzman said.
“Traditions are inﬂuenced by the same fac-
tors as everything else in our lives, class, race,
gender, etc. that are going to inﬂuence what
you do, and we wanted to get people to have
that sense that traditions aren’t fixed."

New campus group adresses issues of sexual assault

Real Men founded, comprised of students and staff, working together to open discussion of violence on campus

av MATTHEW BACHTELL

While many groups on campus are
dedicated to issues of social justice, a new
group has taken a novel approach to pre-
venting sexual assault.

Real Men, which started in the fall of
2009, aims to spread awareness about self
ual assault, and take mucheneeded steps to
reduce the number of cases that occur at
Grinncll college. According to the Cam»
pus Climate Assessment conducted in fall
2009, 17 percent of students thought that
sexual assault was a problem at the college.

“[Real Men]’s purpose is to empower
men, and all genders, really, but speciﬁcally
men, to band together and help prevent
sexual assault as opposed to being the per-
petrators of'it,” said R]. Mahaffey ‘11, the
Senior SA in Clark Hall who was one of
the original members ofthe group

The idea for Real Men came from Dan
Hirsch, the East Campus RLC, who had
done similar work at USC. It was found
that 90 percent of sexual assault cases of
sexual assault cases are perpetrated by the
same four‘percent ofmen at USC.

“VVe’re trying to empower the rest ofthe
men that are not that four percent to take
a stand and do something about it," Hirsch
said,

Assault cases and violent crimes associ—
ated with USC’s athletics and fraternities
prompted the university to create a group,
called Men Care, to address the situation.
After coming to Grinnell, Hirsch decided
to continue the work, adapting it to the
unique setting ofthe College.

“Grinnell is
much more aware,
of things like gender
neutrality and male—
to—male violence,
and other things like
that, that were not as
big of a part of the
workshops [at use]
as they need to be
here to make it fit
with the socially just
culture and the way
Grinnell functions," Hirsch said.

Hirsch spoke with Greg Wallace, Di-
rector of Athletics, about the possibility
of creating a group similar to Men Care
on the Grinnell campus, and approached
a couple of students to begin meetings
last fall. Currently there are eight student
members representing athletes, students
and social justice groups on-cninpus

Real Men is funded by Student Affairs,

the Center for Religious Studies and Social
Justice, and the Athletics Department, and
sought out members to reﬂect this diversity.

Real Men first appeared at the Welle
ness Fair in February. where they passed
out buttons, posters and shirts to kick off
their campaign against sexual assault, and

to challenge coin-
mon perceptions of
what it means to be
“real man." Ree
cenrly, they also held
a workshop for Stil-
dcnt Advisers, as a
preliminary exercise
for feedback, and to
prepare themselves
for future events.

Despite the
name, Real Men's
membership is not restricted by gender, a
significant derail given the group’s commits
ment to campus outreach, and students and

roups are encouraged to contact them at
éfrealnnen] and get involved.

"We're ending our rormarive stage, but
we’re still kind of getting our feet on the
ground and figuring out how we inteiact
with this campus, and people are alr‘cady
reaching out to Real Men," Hirsch said.

The main focus of Real Men over the
summer will be preparing for an NSO
workshop aimed at incoming ﬁrsl’ye’df
male athletes. They will also be partner-
ing with AJust and the Stonewall Resource
Center to raise awareness of the issues of
sexual assault.

“The main thing right now is getting
our name out this spring," Mnhnffey said.

The group is still somewhat unknown,
but it was looked on favorably by a number
of Students.

Students also liked the fact that this so,
cial justice project targeted a group whose
perspective is often the one that is dis-
counted.

“Sometimes I think that Grinnellians,
and this is not necessarily a bad thing, but
we're very focused on social justice and
equality for minority groups, and groups
that are disenfranchised, and I think that
the male perspective, the ‘wasp'perspectivc,
can get left out scmctrmcs here," Hannah
Lyric '11 said. “I also think it's really neat,
because 1 think it can help correct some of
the perceptions people might have of nths
ietes or the geneial masculine phenotype,
which I think will be great for everyone,
hopefully."
