Maid-Rites made right

Founded in Muscatine in 1926, Maid-Rite is 3 Midwest institution. Four roommates travel to Marshalltown to visit the oldest
existing Maid-Rite, and they discuss the merits of its limited menu, miniscule glasses and especially Jake the Walter

by Eva Constantaras,
Emilia Garvey, Kelly Ann
Lee and Erin Sinogba

The rather dingy little building with the red roof on Sixth
street is a haven oilowa life. Loose mcar topples everywhere be»
fore confused college students, while content old men in overalls
sip milkshakes. Maid-Rite, a loosely franchised restaurant chain,
was started in Muscatine in 1926, and the famous loose meat
phenomenon spread from there. A Maid-Rite with “everything"
includes mustard, onions and pickles. And so, to introduce our
audience to one or our favorite things about going to college in
Iowa, we set out on a ﬁeldtrip to Marshalltown. There, the oldest
Maid-Rite in existence, Taylor’s, has happily abided since 1928.

Eva Constantaras: And since we aren’t straight from a Hall-
mark carol, we'll get right into the most insane and inane quasie
restaurant review you’re ever gonna read.

Erin smogba: Marshallrown is a largeish rown situated be»
hind 30 minutes of cotnfields. Except it took us more than 30
minutes because we had a car emergency that required duct tape.
Long story. Different long story, I mean. Anyway, Marshallrown
has many old buildings with funny names like Jiffy Lube. Taylor‘s
Mald‘thc is no different. I mean. that it's old. nor that it has a
funny name. Although it did have a gigantic sign in from that
said “Ship Frozen Mr. Anywhere” that we climbed up on.

Kelly Ann Lee: While enjoying Erin's fascination with ran-
dom things like Jiffy Lube. we had even more fun inside. Once
we had gotten past the initial rush of air conditioning, the ﬁrst
thing we noticed was neither the old chaps chewin’ the far nor the
gleaming counter tops that surrounded a kitchen area ﬁlled with
hustling employees, quaint appliances, hot nuns and sizzling mcar.
Rather, it was our soonriorbe waiter, Jakeiciirly hair, lip ring
and all.

Emilia Garvey: Forcing ourselves to return to our original
purpose. we looked quiaaicaily at the menu hoard. We hoped that
the fries and cheese and 10 billion other menu items like the Ma-
cho Nacho that ﬁlled up our tummies at the Grinnell MaideRite
were hiding somewhere, and that we were iusr too stupid to find
them. so when Jake raid us that, no, they were not available, we
were dismayed. But we bravely accepted our rate and asked for
milkshakes and Maid-Rites, just about the only two things we
could order.

ES: More like shamefully accepted our rare.

EC: Alright ladies, they’ve got it. Moving on As you might
expect in light ofEriii’s troubles ordering, Erin also had a whole
hell ofa lot oftrouble with the actual food, She spilled loose meat
everywhere while Kelly stared absent-miiidedly arJnke, and Emilia
repeatedly asserted her approval orthtse tiny old-fashioned water

glasses that held about a sip and a halrorwater. Apparently pre»
serving traditions comes at the cost orgerting full.

KA: I was notabsenomindedlystatingat Jake! I was mostly
too busy taking really amusing pictures or the girls cleaning up
the spilled milkshakes by EATING THEM OFF THE
COUNTER with their spoons. Never berore have i felt so emr
barrassed. Since everyone sits at the counter wrapped around the
perimeter orthe kitchen, everyone could
gawk at us. That's never Been a problem
with Grinnell's MaideRitc's more convena
tional booths.

EC: Hold up, the milkshakes wouldn’t
ﬁt in the damn glasses, and I’m sure the
spoons ate tor whatever you spill on the
counter because or lock or adequate
dishware. After all, someone spills their
milkshake everyday, according to our
trusrywaiter, who apparently didn't pour
us our shakes to be nice, out rather to save
himselrsome cleanup time. Little did he
know how many ways we would find to
wrote his time.

EG: While Eva spooned up both hers and Erin's milkshake. I
was in the middle oian entirely pleasing burp. Around the same
time I noticed a four yearoid boy licking a coatrstand. He was
almost as cute as lake, whom we proceeded to call over and grill
inecssantiy about his place oiwork.

ES: lake the Walter, despite his boyish charm, is actually a
veteran ortht Maid-Rite. He needed a job who. he was 16 and n
was either MaidrRire or Burger King. Something about the cone
rempruous way he said “Burger King" gave us a hint to why he
chose to work at Maidliite. we like ro think that he chose it
because it was wholesome and unassuming a place his parents
and even his grandparents used to go to but also where the pi-crty
blonde girls with nose rings work. Though the two restaurants
oirerings may be in the same price range, nothing can put a price
on MaideRite's friendly ambiance. Besides, i don't think Burger
King welcomes new employees by pouring ice down a tunnel in
their pants.

so; Jake also told us that they have giant sides ofbeefin the
basemcnr rhar they grind rresh daily. I kind or secretly wished
that he would take me downstairs to show them to me.

EC: yeah, well 1 Was secretly wishing rhar we didn’t come oii
as a cross between ditzy townits and hippy Grinnellians, so his
hiibbly bionde coworkers wouldn‘t give him such a hard time.
And I was quite rine not going into the basement with him to
grind meat.

Someone spills their milkshake
everyday according to our waiter,
who apparently didn’t pour our
milkshakes to be nice but to
save himself some cleanup time.

EG: Mmmmm grind.

KA: kiiight. Sadly, Jake ditched us for his great aunt and uncle,
who were sitting at the opposite end of the counter. Though we
did manage to slip him a loving goodbye note on one orthe many
dollars we left as tip. Tee heel

EC: As we walked out, a rough biker guy in a Harley jacket
and leather bandanawalked in, nodding politely, promising to be

a much less high-maintenance diner who
probably wouldn’t Want to jump his poor
waiter.

EG: We may have gushed about Jake
for the whole ride home and for this whole
article, but I also cherished Taylors Maidr
Rite's unwavering commitment to the
menu that so many Marshalltonians had
loved for so long. As jake explained to us,
“If it changed too much. people would
stop coming.“

EC: And even with its limited menu,
it's a good escape for Grinnellians: a place
where the hardest choice you have to
make is between a chocolate and vanilla
milkshake, instead or between LAT-318 and CHM-363. Plus,
you don't have to see anyone who would actually be craay enough
to take either orthosc classesionly pcoplc whose biggest worry
is sneaking in their own ketchup.
