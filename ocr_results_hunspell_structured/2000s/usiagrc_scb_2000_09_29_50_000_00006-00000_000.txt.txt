How many Gtinnellians know stuff about
Uganda (minus any Ugandan History majors)?
How many Ugandans know about Grinnell?
My guess is nor many unless your name is
Frances Namuswe, a secondeyear here or
Grinnell. it's time to throw open communica-
rion lines and ﬁll the relarively empry erevasscs
of our minds with information on Uganda.
Frances is rhe key ro rhose floodgarcs _ so ro
speak. She graciously agreed ro ler me inrcre

menial journey you have to have a place cre
ated in your mind's eye ro journey to. I don’t

Now imaginc it grecn wirh hills and coffee
ﬁelds where the soybeans used to be (all cone

and you won’t have Uganda bur a sufficicnr
subsrirure for ihe purpose ofrhis arricle.

Namuswe is from Kampala. rhe capirol of
Uganda. She esrimares rhc popularion ro be
around ﬁve million and describes the atmo»
sphere as “wild." ”you’re thinking rigcrs, el-
ephaurs. and ehccrahs you may wanr ro revise

wildlife she laughed. “Yeah, sure I've seen all
those animals. In the zoo! It’s not like they‘re

asked ifmen and women vored in equal nume

scene. Many members ofparliamcnr are women
(as well as rhe vicepresidenr). Uganda is more
liberal in this sense than many ofits neighbots,
alrhough Namuswe suspccred rhar the morives

As for war and riarural disasrers, it seems as
ifrhey werc abour as presenr in Namuswcs life
as rigers and elephanrs in her back yard.
Namuswc granrs war is always happening and
draughrs roo can be a problem, bur for her fam
ily, they mostly exist in the newspapers. Some-
times she admits she hasn’t even heard of the
affecred regions. Mosrly, she says, war affecrs
peoplcs who livc along rhe borders ofneighbot»
ing countries such as congo and Sudan. “1 don't
usually think about these kinds ofthings,” sh:
confesses.

Namuswc’s life, i suspecr, hasn'r headcd
down rhe rypical track. She wenr ro boarding
school in Uganda with 700 boys and 200 girls
until high school. Then, after taking a standard-
ized narionwide resr, shc qualiﬁed ro apply for
high school abroad. She had it narrowed down
to the U.S., Canada. India, England or Not-
way. She ended up in Victoria, British Colume
bia, arreriding an inrernarional High School
before coming here. Evcnrually she says she
thinks she will end up in Uganda afrer some
rravcling.

1n Uganda, Namuswc grew up Chrisrian,
like rhe majority ofpcople. There is also a large
contingmt of Muslims. She admits she was
raised a church girl, going to services every Sui-i-
day When asked what she considered herself
now, she replied wirh a guilryshrug ofher shoul»
