Administration plans for major library construction

While there are currently no definitive plans for the future of Burling Library, simple renovation may not be feasible

Ill/JAMESANTHOI‘ER

Since 1959, the austere edifice of Burl~
ing Library has dominated the landscape
of thc southern edge of campus, providing a
stark contrast to the rows of books and cozy
study houses inside. Now, with construction
and changes on campus leaving no corner un-
touched it was only a matter of time before
the administration turned' its eye to the aging
library

In 2004 the administration formed the
Burliilg Planning Committee to decide when
to begin the next step in the life ofBurling Lie
brary.With the resources of the current library
stretched thin, the elusive ”next step" will be
far more drastic than merely surveying options
and making plans.

“It’s too small," said head librarian Richs
ard Fytrr, “and the way it's laid out doesn't
really allow tor much expansion The third
and tourrh ﬂoors are really very cramped and
I know a lot ofstudcnts find them just a little
uncomfortable.”

In addition to tightness, Marci Sorter,
vice president of Institutional Planning, said
that the
c u r r e n t
library is
not well—
equipped
to meet
the needs

. of futuie
students.
“The role oflibrarics is changing," she said‘ It
)ou rhink about how much crnphasis we put
on research, inquirysbnsed learning ., that
raises sortie interesting questions about what
a library is for."

According to Sortor any new library would
need to be able to completely meet the research
needs of students and faculty

For now, President Russell Osgood said,
the college has adopted “a kind or three-
pronged stmtegy." Construction of the new
science library and a book storage facility cast
of Burling on Sixth Avenue were completed
in conjunction with and in preparation for the
two remaining options facing Burling: renova-
tion or demolition.

Other staff members had similar views
about what would be facing Hurling in the up-
coming years. “The libraries are much more in-
volved in managing many more collections on
campus than we used to be," said Fyffe. “That’s
common to a lot of libraries, in universities as
well as colleges."

Fyffe said that the Library acquisition of the
AV Center collections was just one example of
the integration with technology that Burling
must be able to accomplish successfully in any
future plan.

Currently the issue facing Burling is its
lack of ﬂeXibility in terms of renovation. The
original building, which was last renovated in
1982, cannot support any more additions to
its frame without the
whole structure being
torn up and replaced.

“1‘ WW“ be “"6de mm researth, inquiry-bated learning . ..

costly, extremely trau-
matic," said Sortor. “We
would basically strip it
down to its skeleton.”

Given the estimates
of the Burling Planning
Committee, any renovae
tion would cost as much
or more than a complete demolition and re-
building on the same site.

In addition, the new building would prob
ably have the typical life of a renovation, about
20-25 years, instead of the Life ofa new build-
ing, which would be at least twice as long. “we

would have to think very hard about that new

renovation and see if that was the best thing to
do for the building," said Sorter.

As the campus strategic plan begins to

wind down and the

construction slows,

”/fyou think about how much emphasis we this choice will become

even more discussed
and the ambiguous

thatraisessome interening questions about state Burling remains
what a library is for”

in now will start to be
resolved.

“I’m way, way out
on thin ice with this
projection, [but] i
think we're going to
go pretty soon into a higher gear on the plan
ning," said Osgood.

Fyffe stresses that even in this third, more
advanced stage, the input orsrudenrs and tac-
ulty will be just as important as in the other
two. “We don’t want to rush this process too

fast, because I know how much appeal this
building has for the Community," he said. “1
want to make sure that we're respectful ofit,
and do what we can to recreate the features in
whatever comes next."

Students agreed that this building had a
special signiﬁcance for them, and expressed
concerns about the impact of future construc-
tion.

“I’m worried that the renovations would
take so long and be so drawn out that the li-
brary would not be a good place to study,” said
Kate Morley ’08. “If the library's in disarray
that's a real problem for all ofcampus."

_ Jess Cheney '09 added that she hoped any
new design would incorporate the best as-
pccts of the current library "One of the rea»
sons I came to Grinnell originally was the tree
houses,” she said. “They have a sense of fun
with learning so long as the new building
maintains that spirit of play and functionality
it would be good"

Zogby urges new diplomacy in Iraq

view, we're good, they're evil, which sees diplomacy as a sign
of weakness. They don't want to compromise with evil. So for

respect them, they don’t know why we don’t apply them in the
way we behave I actually think that wt: can turn this around,

them, diplomacy, or what they've called it, is really
talking at people.

Finally, why is Middle East po1icy so impor—
tant, and why should itbe set as a priority for the
candidates?

Well, it's important because, we've sent more
money. lost more troops. taught more battles, lost
more lives and have more at risk. And we're still
not getting it right. And ifit's been bad before, it
can get worse in years to come. We have intlanted
an entire region ofthc world,and set them against

us, And I don't thinlt that it has to be that way. From all of the
polls we're done, the region wants to like usiTlml region wanrs
to be respected by us and respect us, lrthcy see our values and

but I don’t think we can turn it around unless we
make a deliberate effort to engage, first by are
derstanding them, and then by being respectful.
And then by shaping problems by thinking about
what solves pr,oblems ritther than what aggra—
vates them We have this victor and vanquished
mindset, like in Iraq we said we're going to defeat.
when instead what we should have done is find
a way to transform. And so diplomacy seeks to
transform, nee-conservatism seeks to defeat, but
ifyou don’t know the history, the culture and the
social norms of the country you're operating in,

you’re going to have policies that instead of accomplishing your
objective are going to make it worse. That's what we’ve done.
