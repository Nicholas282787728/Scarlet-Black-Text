Russian language assistant Vera Bobkova
spent Winter Break making friends with a
gaggle of senior Citizens. Bobkova and her
Grinnellian host mother traveled the East
Coast, warmly welcomed in Florida by her 83-
year-old host grandmother- (of sorts) and her-
friends, the youngest of whom was $3. This ’s
one oftlie unique friendships which have bios:
somed from Grinnell's host family program

“We both really enjoyed the nmc..,Tlicl‘e
wasn't this huge generation gap, We went out,
we went to the restaurants, the ocean. It was a
really cool host family experience." said Bob-
kovri.

Every year, the international student Scrr
vices oliicc finds over 50 families in Grinnell,
via word of mouth and newsprlpcr ads, to act
as fourtycar hosts for incoming international
students. The college distributes a questiolr
naiie to those international students who want
a host family and, depending on the student‘s
interests and family’s resources snidents may
live with their hosts for weeks ni just visit oc-
casionally for meals,

Judy Garland '00 and leff Garland '67 are
perhaps Grinnell's most prolific host patents t
t they’ve taken care of 12 students over the last
nine years.

“We are much more aware ofthe challenges
faced by students who choose to come here,"
said Judy Garland,“Learningnt an academicalr
1y tough college in a second or third language,
dealing with new social customs, facing family
joys and tragedies from long-distance, frustra-
tions with international travel arid being away
from family, sometimes for year's..rTliis makes
us better citizens ofthc world"

The goal of the host family program isiit
just to welcome and support international
students, but to help integrate them into the
American culture that exists outside ofthc col~
lege‘s dormitories and academic buildings.

“We think it's really important for the in-
ternational student to make a connection with
the community.“ said Janet Nexantlei‘,assislant
dean and director of International Student
Services at Grinnell College. “We say: make
the student part of your life, but don't change
your life We want the student to see your life

as it really is."

one of the experiences Raquel Morales Cid,
the Spanish language assistant, most values was
eating dinner in the home of her host parents,
Fred and Sara Hagemeister,

“Usually, we met for dinner several times,
They have three daughters and it is always re-
ally messy at home. Like sometimes,when we are
talking, they have to go and help the baby stop
crying... It's really cool because it's a really famile
iar experience," said Morales Cid. “This is a great
way to get out of the college You forget about
your assignments, your classes, whatever” .you
spend an evening with a family with other things
on their minds

These small gestures and moments are part
ofthe programs largcr ambition: creating a coni-
for-table dialogue between people of differing
backgrounds. While every host family structure
is different. the host family is often an important
support group that the student' can trust and be
at ease with.

Marlene Spi-aggins Jacks as an additional
mothei"'she can confide in without feeling
pressured.

“We communicate by phone or (sci-nail
and we set up a dinner or a meeting. It‘s
usually spontaneous,” said Jidenma. "Two
weeks ago, 1 was talking to her on the
phone, whining about liowI have so much
work, and she's like ‘Oh, let’s go to the
Thai restaurant!' I feel like she's my friend
and I can just call her."

Patina Yalcin '07 and her host parents
Rebecca Loew and Jackie Brown, Biology
have a similar relationship built on support
and understanding Some of the events
they’ve shared have been familiar, like ccl-
cbi-ating a birthday, while other were new
to Yalcin, who is from Turkey.

“Halloweetul remember, whcnI was in
my second year, i rvenr and earved pump:

The perils & prospects of professors on [Plans]

How do academic & professional lives blur in the Internet realm of inside jokes and students’ semi- public secrets?

By RACHEL FIELDS .

Sarah Lu "o7 rarely shares her personal life with her profes:
sors. Like most Grinnell students, she considers the classroom
primarily a place for learning » a forum in which professors
and students should limit themselves somewhat in their inlet-
personal relations. Yet alinost every day, Lu updates her Plan
— sometimes about academics, sometimes about her everyday
life , with the knowledge that both professors and ndininistmt
tors could be reading it I think its cool that professors are part
of [the Plans] community, said Lu. “It reminds me that lrn
part of an intellectual campus community where people know
you and remember what you say.”

The number of professors active on Plans difficult to prri
down and Plans Administrator Eryn O'Neil '07 estimates it
st a couple number." one certainty is that the number has in:
creased in recent years due to the accessibility ofPlans, though
Planless professors are still in the large majority.

“1 got a plan in April 2003, when computer Science prov
fessors were still the only faculty on Plans,” said Eric Simpson,
Englis For Simpson, the main draw of Plans at first was the
accessi lity ofonline versions ofold movies from the sniderio
film festival Titular Head. “1 had been a judge and wanted to
share some ofthc ﬁlms with friends,"Simpson said. “I had also
spent a lot of time participating in virtual communities in the
19905 so I knew how interesting and fun they could be."

Other professors boast a longer history with Plans. Since
alumni can keep their Plans accounts for as long as they wish,
Grinnell students- --cum faculty are able to see the community
from both sides. 1 got a Plan because it was a way to keep in
touch with friends of mine, said Jeremy Yoiide '9‘}, Political
Science, “I don't necessarily tell my students I'have a Plan, but
they manage to find out."

Since many students use their Plans to describe their lives
outside the classroom — which often include sex, drugs and al-

coliol — the presence of professors on Plans can be worrisome.
“To be honest,tlicre are certain stupid things I wrote [on Plans]
as a first year, before I realized that administrators read Plans,"
said Lu.

Katherine Jarvis '09 said that she is most uncomfortable
with professors who “lurk" on Plans, logging in regularly but
never updating. “I don't censor my Plan, but the thought of a
professor reading.)7 makes the think that I shouldn't write certain
things." 5hr: said.D

Top her Eldeikin 08 agreed with Jarvis, addinrr that Plans
“breaks down the barriers between your personal and academic
life."

But students‘ concern might not be neces-
sary: both Simpson and Youde insist that they
would never use Plans to seek out unsolicited
information about a student's pcrsonal life. “I
do not read the Plans of current students autos
maticnlly," said Simpson. “I read some of them
through plaiilove and some by clicking links in
another Plan." The professors added that they
would honor a smdcnt's wishes for personal
privacy Sam Rebelslty, Computer Science, notes at the top of
his Plan, “ Mrrir‘rrgrrrsm/p/rnr, So do atlvt'rfnzﬂ'rr‘arx. Ifyou don't
want me to read your plan put No Professors, Pleascl' or some‘
thing similar at the top of your plan.

To avoid complications in professor student relationships.
Simpson tries to avoid discussing Gtiiine academics on Plans,
“1 have noticed almost no effect on my teaching,” he said. “I sel:
doin talk about my'classcs on Plans, and students almost never
bring up clasSrrclatcd topics there."

Yoiide agreed that the professot'csmdcnr line should be

kept as professional as possible when dealing with Plans. “How ,

much you put on there is completely up to you." he said “I'm
riot going to par anything up there about a deep emotional err

”/ don’tnetersarl/y le/l my
students I have a Plan, but they
manage to ﬁnd our.”

s.Though the existence of professor Plans is troubling to
some, many students see it as a way to expand and strengthen
the Grinnell community. “I don't really care if professors read
my Plan," said Molly Dahlberg '07. “I wouldn’t change what I
write because ofrt."

Lu added that when joining Plans, students should accept
that the community is by no means a completely private forum.
“Some students have an idealized image of Plans," she said.
“While 1 think free speech is important,you have to be respon-
sible. If you put somerhirig up there and someone responds
negatively, that's a nceessai-y and healthy par-t otfrec speech."

Since Paul VVainriglit '06 was arrested after an allegedly
threatening message on his Plan was read
by school administrators, the Grinnell Colt
lege community has become more aware
of the possible unintended consequences
of online actions. The website provides
no protection from legal proceedings or
guarantee ofprivacy Since a portion ofthe

Pam/ml Scienfe Grinnell faculty function as mandatory res

porters iii the case of threats and sexual

Violence, students shorild be aware that they are writing for a
wider audience than their peers.

Th‘ough both parties recognize the potential issues involved
in a facultycstudcnt blegging system, most users agree that
Plans has a positive effect on academic relationships. Plans has
long been utilized to facilitate communication between faculty,
students and alumni, especially for students who choose to
study off-campus or alums who want to keep in contact with
Grinnell friends. The relationship between professors and
students is no different, Lu believes. “I really didn't read [Eric
Simpson's] plan until after I was done with his class,"slie, d.
“It was cool because you could have a connection with profes-
sors you weren't in class with anyinorc,"
