ognizable future, the film focuses on the consequences

The movie opens with this b11re1ucr1tic state

Gilliam presents Lowiy 1s 1 profoundly 1verr

in danger.

Aspects of Gilliam’s Monty Pyzlmi days appear
throughout Brazil. The visual elements of the movie
are srriking as he leads his audience into the strange,
retro-futuristic world of his characters. The film's
distinctive style strengthens the overall experience,
complimenting the complacency of the inhabitants
of this society while heightening the severity of this
dystop

Bl'nzi 1s an intriguing, frightening film th1t forces
audiences to recognize that the carefully controlled,
regnilared world that Gilliam depicts is uncomfortably
familiar. This recognizable state presents Brazil at its

Dystopia, Version 2.0

As our worlds populntion grows 1r 1 mte r1111
would make Malthus pioutl, it is difficult to imagine
the infertility and childlessness of Alfonso Clinton’s
(Hm 1y Pal/er run] 1/;c Pl‘irmit'r ifAzll/ii'mi) Children

1nto th1s dystopia, opening with the world mourning
the death of the youngest person on the planet, 13,
yc1r- -old Diego.

The movie never explains why women 1re infertle,
but 1t doesnt have to The anarchy, tc1r 1nd hopeless-

suspend any curiosity about their causes.

Cunron's cinematic genius allows the viewer to
overlook some of the weak dialogue, but no amount
of c111er1 work will stop me from being unhappy th1t
a pivotal character dies 20 minutes in. After that, the
film's only real problem is poor pacingicvcn the 1o

If you ’re into gratuitous violence...

If you dislike gr1tuitous violence, amid Grate
bouts. But if w1tching people ger mauled by zoms
hics or tom apart in gluesome car w1ecks sparks your
interest, this movie has more than enough action to
satisfy, A collaborative effort between Robert Rodii-
gucz and Qlcntin Taranrino, Grind/mom consists of
two separate movies, complete with several amusing
fake tiailers and advertisements.

Rodriguez directs the first film, P/mlcz Terror, in
which a deadly biochemical agent infects a small Texr

While Platiri Tet-1w dishes out the blood and guts

stalking them. He proceeds to murder them with his
“death proofm stunt car, which he can crash at high
