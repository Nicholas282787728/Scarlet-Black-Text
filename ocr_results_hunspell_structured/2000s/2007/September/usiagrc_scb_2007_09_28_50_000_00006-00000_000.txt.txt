Returning good
music to Grinnell
from back in the day

BYJEFF RADERSTRONG

Grinnell is a hard place to be if you are looking for good
music unless you look on the Internet. Radio Shack has a small
selection of CDs, and WehMart offers the typical arrange
ment otpop-radio rotations. But now, thanks to Steve Ratcliff,
residents of Grinnell are no longer restricted to these limited
selections.

Last month, Ratcliii" opened up Back in the Day on Sixth
Avenue next to [he Medieap Pharmacy it's a small music shop
with only two rooms, but they contain 9,000 vinyl records,
2,500 CDs, a collection of vintage 8-tmcks and cassettes, in-
cense, posters and a small selection ofclothing.

Walking into Back in the Day, it docs seem like you have
been tmnspianted somewhere else ifnot back in time, deﬁnitely
out of Grinnell. Punk music is usually playing, and Ratcliff,
with his long goatcc, greets you in from ofa wall covered in
music posters and old concert announcements. Next to the tags
isrer are vintage posters from magazines that Ratcliff himself
has collected. The shop is dark, like any good locally owned
music store, but still inviting.

Back in the Day tries to keep its music selection as diverse
as possible. “[VVe have] vintage stuff, classic music. with some
new stuff. of course," said Ratcliff. “[With CDs] we focus on
underground music and not as much mainstream stuff." The
vinyl collection, housed in the back room, contains artists from
Donovan to Led Zeppelin to John Travolta, in addition to quite
a few records for spinning and mixing. The CDs he stocks are
mostly underground punk and metal,

Ratcliffprides himselfon hringinga different type ofmusic
culture to Grinnell. “I like having music that no one else has,"
he said. His Grinnell store is a transplanted version of Ratt’s
Records, the ﬁrst music store he owned in Des Moines.

Not only is Ratcliffthe owner, he is also the only employee
ofBack in the Day. In addition to his work at_the*store. he is
