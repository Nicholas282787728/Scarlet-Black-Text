Why Perry rpm in

I had gone to Perry a number of times to the hotel, and I
was just amazed that nobody knew about the culture change,
people who were tCIling me to go to the hotel, from Des
Moines. they didn’t talk about the culture change, they didn’t
talk about what was around the corner from the hotel.
150 yards or something like that, and I was fascinated by
it, and I received an invitation to write an article about
a town in Iowa that counters the corn-belt stereotype,
and I felt Party with its inﬂuence in meatepacking, La-
tinos, and its in inﬂuence in concern for immigration

and celebrating it, was a perfect example.

Iwouldn'c make such a rim. 1 would say Perry isunique

When I awoke on Saturday

April 21st, 2007, I realized that I had

no matching socks. But unlike most days, on Saturday, A ril Zist,
2007, it was okay to have no matchin socks. That was t e day I

was a cowbo . I was heading west an

had to dress the part. My

compadre, A ex Wolf '10, a man with true grit, would take the
reigns of our 15,000 horsepower wagon on the long voyage to

John Wayne's birthplace.

John Wayne was born in western Iowa,
near the town of Winterset. Alex and I set
off early in rhc morning and drove across
the paved prairie for miles, using our scouts
ing skills and our instincts to ﬁnd the way. We
knew we were close when we turned on to
John Wayne Drive. We passed the Madison
County visitor center and a sign directing us
to a live auction. We made two rights, drove
past two small white shacks connected with a
bridgeslike patio and realized we had passed
our destination.

After parking our sports utility stagecoach
around the block, Alex and I sauntered past
a van covered with John Wayne murals, the
dinky visitor center and right up to the boys
hood abode. “Here is where heroes are born."
I thought as I looked at the humble home.
I wanted to walk up the porch stairs, and
through the stain—glossed door, but entrance
required a ticket and a liaison.

Our tour guide, Betty, signaled us and we
walked across the porch to the birth home.
Berry began to speak quickly, and continued
steadily, like a freighted colt on the open fron-
tier. She shouldered up at about 5 foot and
woie :1 blue pants With a white belt.

We started in the kitchen, where aged
Betty told us, at length, the history of the
Morrison family. John Wuyne was born Mars
ion Robert Morrison in 1907 and weighed a
galloping 13 pounds at birth, Betty excitedly
informed us during her non-stop lasso ofJohn
Wayne trivia.

In the corner ofthe kitchen sat a small bed
with a red quilt, which Betty told us allowed
tiny, vivacious mother Mary to keep an eye
on Marion as she walked in the kitchen, On
the shelves of the kitchen stood pharmaceuti»
cal bottles from father Clyde's business, One
once held the cure for kidney and liver boiglsr
disease.

The last two rooms were filled with
memorabilia and photographs.The collection
included the see-through eye patch of \VI'HS’
key—drinkrn' us Marshall, Rooster Cogburn,
original 37D glasses from “John Wayne in
3-D as Hondo,’3 and suit cases the charms

Stagecoach.

The tour ended with pictures and guest
log from Ronald Reagan’s
historic Visit, and of Duke
I and II, orange county
police helicopters named
after the legend. Betty told
us we had 15 minutes to
look around on our own in
the house,and the place tell
silent.

I noticed that moustachred former Iowa
Governor Terry Eranstad cleverly signed his
name under Reagan's about thrcc timcs darker
than anyone in the guest log, and may have got
his hand in one ofthc two pictures ochagan's
monumental visit. I also noticed John Wayne
collector’s guns, such as the Armed Forces
John Wayne Commcmorarive as automatic,
and an ivory handled, silver and gold plated
Commemolarive six-shooter. Guns and Ronald
Reagan: there is no better way to celebrate a
cowboy, a legend, and a patriot.

March 21, 1001

As we walked out I took a better look at
the customized 1980 Chevy van sitting next
to the hitching post. According to a piece of
paper in the window, a fan spcnt $50,000 for
the boxy van to be painted with murals of the
legend. The side windows had etched ﬁgures
ofWayne holding a smoking riﬂe, standing ase
sertively next to a rattle snake and the skull of
alonghorn. On the back, a large portrait of the
Duke melded into an American ﬂag, next to a
full body shot ofu sparkling revolver.

Having thoroughly explored the adjoining
shacks or John Wayne's
youth, resourceful Alex
and I had a hankering
for something else to do.

bered the red arrow points

house. I was ﬁxin’ on a
portrait of George and Martha Washington,
until 1 was our-bid by a more passionate col»
lector by a dollar.

Then I found the item that I would win:
a large worn earthen pot. Nor suprisingly, I
didn‘t understand the stout stein-shaped auc-
tioneer, because after I bid he informed me
(112“ the pot was cracked. I near about shouted
"It's cracked?! Oh Shirl” I was certainly loud
enough for the gaggle of elderly country cola
lectors to hear and to scorn. It gives .ne com-
fort that John Wayne would probably approve
of the language and the pot.

The ﬁrst premieres were in October ofzuoo, one in Perry,
one in Des Moines, and one at the state Latino Conference,
after that we received feedback from selected people in each

did more interviews, and did rewriting, over a period of
about three months, and then it premiered again in the
