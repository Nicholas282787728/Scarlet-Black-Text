SEAMUS Electroacouslic Music Conference
Each week the 5598 sends one Grinnellian to explore a Midwest oddity

March 8-10, 2001

 

By MARK ROOT-WILEY
The 13 bleary-eyed Grinnell students heading to the Soci-
ety for Electroacoustic Music in the United States (SEAMUS)
conference knew better than to speculate about what to
expect. Sure, as members of Grinnell’s Transmedia Art and
Electronic Music courses, we were all experienced music
nerds, but electroacoustic music festivals are usually view-
ing and hearing spectacles you could not imagine before-
hand. Especially an avant—garde electroacousti'c music festi-
val taking place in whitebread Ames, Iowa.

My only expectation was to be inspired
and astounded, taken to the edge of my seat
with dramatic music and disoriented by mind-
blowing videos But as our three- -day artistic
safari unfolded — containing 89 pieces (if you
include the installation featuring eight speak»
ers playing the sound of a brook into a dark
room) in 14 concerts and 12 papersm almost
everything I viewed was sleeprrnducrng, cyst
rolling, cardrum»blowing
and just plain boring.

In an hour and a half,
our two»van caravan ca-
rcencd across the prairie
toward Ames. home otagr
centric Iowa State Univerr
sity. I entered the music
budding, which matched
the 70s, retro, all-concrete
look of the rest of ISU,
stepping into the liallvmy that would domi-
natc the next three days of my life. Twenty
feet in on the left, an auditorium, Twenty feet
in on the right, :i large classroom. These two
rooms would cruelly pingrpong their captives
back and forth for three long days.The festival
attracted a crowd of mostly middleraged men
with MacBooks and long ponytails. At one
point, eight of them sat in a row, with identi-
cal silver computers emblazoned with glowing,

barelytconsumcd apples. I had little time to
gawk because no sooner had we gotten our
personalized SEAMUS (pronounced, with
unintentional irony, as “SPLAME»us") name
tags, the first concert began.

I later learned that the pieces from the new
members ofthc SEAMUS crowd were played
in the first concerts ofthe weekendsThus, my
hopedrror inspiring, astounding, seatsclenchr

ing weekend began with
the worst of the worst.
The theater went black
and a man entered the
stage and sat down
with his mixing hoard.
Joining him on stage,
a woman carefully apt
proached an antenna , a
theramin to be precise
— which she practically
caressed (wirhout actually touching it) the
entire piece Soon, clicks and hand»controlled
giiss'andos from the woman, performing as her
alter ego "Qreen Slacker", from time to time
interrupted the drones, apparently controlled
by the man, “Catatonic Head." Yet, even as
Catatonic Head intently slid lirs sliders and
trirned knobs, it was unclear whether he actu-
ally was changing any otrhc sounds. Already,
the music dragged on a bit longer than I could

handle.

Even halfway through the first concert, it
was a challenge to remember the piece 1 had
heard five minutes earlier. Was it that one
played on the computer in the dark or the Olht
er one played on the computer in the dark? All
of a sudden, the 10 am. sociology class I was
missing seemed like fun when compared to
enduring this 9:15 a.m. concert. Even worse,
the rheramin piece turned out to be an excep-
tion, as it was the only electronic instrument
we would see all weekend.

After a twathour break spent consumt
ing OutTakes, it was back to concert number
two. More music. Without real performers. In
a dark room. Accompanied by three-minute
naps

Every piece would go something like this:
some sound starts quietly and then gets louder
and louder and louder, and then BOOM! Sr-
lence. Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle. Some crackly noise
enters that sounds like bubble wrap (literally
in one piece) or broken glass. Then began the
sounds or either V'mtcr or people.
Throughout the glass/water/
pcopldbubblc wrap, the chaos
increases and the tension makes
you want to screamThis Contint
ires for 5,10 minutes. Then the
piece is over, rarely with much ofa
conclusion or satisfaction,

From my seat in the halftfrllcd
theater, I turned from focusing on
the music ro festering with cynical thoughts.
Were we Grinnellians the only people here
who didnt submit eirher a paper or a compo-
sition? I began to wonder whether we were in
the presence orevery electroacousric music tan
in the United Statesman 100 ofthcm.

Even though each piece's unique program
notes filled me wrtli the desperate hope that
this piece was finally something different
(sans the two pieces that both deconstructed

the programs were far more interesting than
the pieces. The notes included things like “an
electronic composition based on texts extracted
from schizophrenics’ statements." or, better yet
“Sustenance is to maintain something in exist

must itself be sustained t creating a paradox."

Somehow the myriad pieces wrth source
sounds ranging from chalk to schizophren-
ics to the occasional normal instruments went
into a computer and all came out sounding the
same. The few memorable pieces mosdy stood
because of things other than the sounds. In
fact, the schizophrenic piece was most memor

The weekend went by in a haze. I felt Like
I was wading through one long day interrupt-
ed by intermittent bouts of sleep at the hotel.
Highlights of the day tended to be things like
going outside or moving for more
than five minutes.

After one excruciating concert
and a paper sessron, the gaggle of
Grinnellians went to the “Pizza
Pit” which was, despite its name,
on the second ﬂoor ora building.
After discovering it was a better
deal ro get are extra large pizzas
instead of four. 10 of us devoured
the pizzas: two cheese, two pepperoni. one sau-
sage. It was the only time all weekend where
quantity trumped quality. Each slice was more
memorable and pleasurable than an entire elect
troacoustic concert. All the while, we swayed
to the sweet-sounding tunes of Britney Spears
and Christina Aguilera on the radio. In just a
weekend, wr: became born-again pop fans.
