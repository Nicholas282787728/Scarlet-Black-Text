Softball season
in full swing

BY NATE LINDSEY

The Pioneer softball players started the MWC season in
impressive fashion by winning all three or their games during
the first day of the Midwest Conference Classic last weekend.
Grinnell then dropped two close games in the second day to
come back home with a 372 MWC record,

The Pioneers met up against Beloit in the ﬁrst game ofduy
one in Janesv‘ille,W'l. Down 470 at the end of the fifth inning,
Emily Stewart '08 started a three—run inning by doubling in
Kim Durinick ’09. The bottom ofthc seventh then piovided a
Hollywood ending.

The Pioneers were down by two runs and down to then
last out when I<iin Duriniek'o9 hit a single to keep rho inning
alive. Stewart knocked her in with a double to move Grinnell
to within one min.

Then, reigning firstrteam AthWC seleetion Darey Ward
’09 came up to bat representing the winning run. She crossed
the plate as the winning run a moment later after jacking a
walk-off home run.

“The fences seemed like they were short of regulation, but
it felt amazing," Ward said.

In the second game orthe day, the Pioneers squeezed out a
2-1 win over Lawrence University behind a two-run home run
from Ward and a eombined four-hitter by LeAnn Steinberg'o7
and Tess Cohen '09.

In the third and final game of the day, the Pioneers of
Grinnell easily put away the Pioneers from Carroll, 6-2. Ern-
ily Kolbe ’07 held Carroll to just four hits in over six innings
pitched.

Ward went seven for 11 on the first day ofthe tournament
(Sunday), but found herself and her team struggling to bring
runners home on Monday. Against Ripon, rhe Pioneers and
Red Hawks gave the crowd a true pitching duel between Grinr
nell's Steinberg and Ripon's Andrea Knorr'09,

Steinberg threw a no-hitter through the sixth, but a couple
of walks, an error and two singles at the rep of the seventh
put the Red Hawks up by two runs. oeensively, the Pioneers
stranded six basemnners.

“[Rlporl is] a good team with good batters," Ward said.

“Our pitching was outstanding, but we had problems getting
runners in.

St. Norbert was much the same story offensively with the
Pioneers stranding ii runners and losing 6-1.The game was
within one run until a threesrun St. Norbert home run in the
fifth,

“Winning three is good, but we would have liked to win all
five,"coach Tom sonniehsen said. “On Monday, we put runners
on base but struggled to bring them in. Obviously, our hitting
was not consistent between the two clays."

Ward felt conﬁdent overall with the team’s performance and

believes some extra practice with bunting drills this week will
improve the team’s ability to bring baserunners home.

“Overall our team is working really well together and wins
ning is going to be a matter ofworki'ng out the details,” she
said.

conference doubleheaders on the road against Knox College
and Illinois College. But Grinnell fans can catch the team at
home twice this week. Loras College comes to town Wednes-
