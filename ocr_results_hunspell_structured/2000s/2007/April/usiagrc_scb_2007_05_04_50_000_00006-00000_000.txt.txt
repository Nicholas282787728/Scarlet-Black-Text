When Katie Jares '07 started teaching at
the Newton prison four years ago, she was
surprised to learn that the inmates had al—
ready heard of Grinnell College. “Their ini-
tial response in my very first class was ‘Oh,we
make you guys’ furniture.”

indeed, according to Roger Baysden,
the director of Iowa Prison Industries (IPI),
Grinnell has been buying prisonsmaclc ﬁlmi—
ture for over 15 years. All ofthe wooden fur-
niture in each dorm room was manufactured
by inmates at the Iowa State Penitentiary in
Ft. Madison, while the metal bed frames in
the older dorms were made by prisoners in
the Anamosa State Penitentiary. Between
July 1, 2006 and March 31, 2007, the school
purchased $36,272 worth offurniture. In fact.
Grinnell and IN have developed such a good
relationship that IPI designed the “Grinnell”
line ofred oak furniture, available for viewing

dar and Director of Student Life Jen Krolm
agree that the service they have reccived from
IPI has been exceptional.

“We aren't going to them to save mon-
ey,” explained Godar. “VVe’l‘e going to them
because of the quality." Unlike most donn-
furniturc manufacturers, who make their
products out ofcheap and ﬁrmsy ﬁberboard
or composition wood, 1P1 builds solid wood
fuiniture that lasts for years.

l<rohn said that she constantly receives
brochures from other furniture companies
and sees their products at conferences. “Most
of them are ﬁberboard with a little veneer,
and that’s not going to last very long in a
dorm setting,” she said. “I don't think it lasts
very long in a house."

While fiberboard furniture would have to
be thrown away every time a dorm is rcfur»
bished, Godar said IPI will take back the fur-
niture and rebuild it. He said thatthey usually
have the furniture from one dorm, or 200*
300 pieces ofﬁirniturc, refurbished at the end
ofeach academic year.

And according to Jares, the prisoners are
happy to work with IPl too. Unlike other
prison jobs, where employees might make
60 cents per day (yes, day, not hour), in 11”]
shops they can make 50 cents to $1.25 an

hour, which, at eight to 10 hours per day, helps
cover their legal fees, ﬁnes and child support
payments.

Krohn said that no students have ever ap—
proached her with concerns about the college’s
choice to buy from prison industries. For those
who are concerned with prisoners' rights, dec
ﬁning their stance could be difﬁcult. Both pros
and anti-prisonvlabor groups have strong argu—
ments on the issue.

For students like Jares, the low wages at 1P1,
while above average for prisoners, are still uns

. acceptable. “From a very basic standpoint,” she

said, “I think that in a lot of ways it’s recreat-
ing slave labor," She pointed to the fact that the
majority of people in prisons across America
are racial minorities, including in Iowa, where
95% ofthe population is white. According to an
article in the New York newspaper ElDr/ziia-
La Pr-rnra, prison labor initially started in the
South after the Civil War as a way to continue
slavery, Blacks were arrested on trumped-up
petty theft charges and for railurc to fulﬁll their
sharecropping duties, and were then rented out
to plantations.

Proponents of the prison system argue that
modern prison labor is useful for prisoners.
Baysden cited a University of Baltimore study
on Iowa inmates that found that the recidivism
rate r oi the percentage ofinmates who are at"
rested and incarcerated again after their release
— for IPl employees was less than six percent,
while the statewide average is 39 percent. He
also said that inmates learn valuable skills and
a work ethic that will be applicable to any job
they ﬁnd once they are released. Furthermore,
IPI employees have an advantage in trout orthe
parole board. By working in the hrrninrre shop,
the inmates who make Grinncll's furniture can
demonstrate cooperation, interpersonal skills,
work ethics and good behavior that could take
time oirthcir sentences. A member of the pa-
role board is also on IPI's board ofdiiectois.

Baysden explained that the workers receive
low pay —whlch is classiﬁed as a “stipcndwath.
er than a “wage,"and therefore is not subject to
minimum wage laws A because they don't need
to pay for their own food and rent. All of that
comes out ofthe state's pocltct, as do the wages
for the guards who supervise inmates as they
work.

IPI isn’t the only organization that views
prison labor as a good thing. The Amerie
can Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is firmly
against privatelysconttacted prison labor be—
cause they fcar that low prison wages could
undermine workers unions outside of pris-
ons.

Government prison industries can only
legally sell to other government ofﬁces and
nonproﬁt institutions, such as churches and
colleges.

in an open letter, Laura Murphy, director
of the ACLU’s National Office in Wﬂshllig’
ton D.C., wrote argued that former Federal
Prison industries (FPI) employees had hrghcr
chances ofcmployment and higher wages ar-
ter their incarceration, and were 24 percent
less lrkely to engage in criminal behavior. She
also said that FPI was acnrally creating jobs
for the wider population by buying materials
from outside vendors. However, Murphy also
said that if lawmakers wcie worried about
prisoners’ low pay undermining unions, they
could institute policies to pay inmates the
prevailing wage in their area.

Ben Stone, the executive director orowa's
ACLU branch, said that “We [the ACLU]
support the right of prisoners to ﬁnd a way
to get decent treatment and compensation,”
and would support prisoners’ efforts to fight
for the minimum wage. However, he said that
the organization supports prison industries
because of its rchabilitatiw: role in inmates'
lives.

working with Grinnell also occasionally
offers a few inmates the chance to take a break
from prison. A team of supervised prisoners
helps deliver the and unload the furniture
every time an order comes in. Les Ollinger,
Associate Diiectoi of Facilities Management,
either has the dining hall prepare lunch for
them or prepares a meal himself. According
to Cedar, “[Ollingcr] is so famous there that
when we need something, they've got people
lining up to come rip here just because ofthc
meals."

But not cveiybody is so keen on federally-
run prison labor. Among those opposed are
Critical Resistance (CR), a Califoi'niaslmscd
prison abolition organization Whose stated
mission is "to end the Prison Industrial Come

plex by challenging the belief that raging and
controlling people makes us safe." Ari Wohlc
feiler, a repiesentative of CR, said that the bigs
gest problem with prison industries is not the
wages, but the nature ofprison itself. According
to him. “even if people in prison were getting
paid 520 per hour, it would still be a problem
that they're locked up." More speciﬁcally, the
organization objects to the conditions of prison
labor and the lack ofcontrol that prisoners have
over their own working conditions.

Baysden said that the workers are repre»
sented by a union director who is required by
law to have a place on the IPI directors' board.
However, this union is state-run, and, frankly,
he said, “prisoners have no input over the union
whatsoever,”

“That's not a union," said Wohlfeiler. “The
fundamental point of a union is to give the
workers a voice.“VVohlfeiler also countered sta-
tistics showing lower recidivism rates for IPI
employees with the argumcnt that “the best way
to reduce recidivism is to not violate people on
parole so much." He believes that inmates on
parole are subject to unfair scrutiny, so “even
people who are trying to make it” can end tip
back in jail too easily. Even so, wohlﬁelcr thinks
that “enforced idleness”among inmates is more
damaging than federally-run prison industries.
“It’s important not to stop with prison labor,”
he said, “but to connect that to a longtteim so-
lution."

Wohlfeiler hasn’t heard of any college ad-
ministrations boycotting prison-made goods,
brrt he would be intcrcstcd in seeing a campus
could tie prison labor to other prison reform is
sues.

jares thinks that Gr-innell can come up with
creative solutions to make prison labor better
for prisoners and their families. For example,
if the college is squeamish about piessuring
lPI to raise their wages, she said that Grinnell
could conceivably come up with enough money
to help inmates meet their child support pay
ments.

“That would be pretty fantastic and set an
amaz g precedent," she said. In the meantime,
Grinncllians can look forward to seeing the
same sturdy furniture in their rooms every year,
and prisoners can look forward to paychecks
around 20 percent of the minimum wage.
