On Tuesday of this week,
Cho Seung-Hui, a student at

Virginia Tech, shot and killed 33

people including fellow students, pIoV

fessois and himself. The guns Clio used were
legally purchased from a gun shop in Virginia and an onliuc
gun store based in Wisconsin. He obtained the weapons wuh
lupparently little ditl‘iciilty, which has re-ignitcd the debate
l over gun control.

5 Democratic House member Carolyn McCarthy urged
ifor mole stringent controls on Wednesday, culling fol po-
litical lenders to stop what she sees as pindering to the gun
industry “The unfortunate Situation in Virginia could have
been avoided if congressional leaders stood up to the gun
lobby,” she said. in an editorial published yesterday, Tot New
'Ymk Toner echoed the calls for tighter regulation by asking
..how, afteI detailed tracking of the guns purchased for the
lghnstly spree, [can] the lethal empowerment of such a trou-
bled individual somehow be pronounced entirely legal under
the laws of a civilized nation."

Opponents of tightei gun-control laws are, instead, say-
ing the incident is reason for less regulation. Larry Pratt with
.Gun Owners of America suggested that a greater presence
of guns would deter potential killings for fear of being shot
themselves. “Isn’t it interesting that Utah and Oregon are the
only states that allow faculty to carry guns," he said. “And
isn’t it interesting that you haven't read about any school or
university shootings in Utah or Oregon?"

ﬁg This Week in Joint Board

 

 

~ Wednesdays special guest at Joint Board was Stephen

uncontested, Schierenbeck
expressed some concern that
the position might be viewed
as relatively insigniﬁcant, To
combat this perception, he
said he plans on working hard
to expand the work of the
Federation “The problem is
that [involvement] rises and
falls with people who are ac-
tive or inactive,” he saw]. “We
could have a better, it than
we had last yeai.” He said that
the position is what he will
make ofit,

Schierenbcck says thar’
he is committed to his posi-
tion and he hopes that the
Federation will have a large
involvement in the upcoming
elections, as it has historically.
In the upcoming presidential
election in 2008, Schieren-
beck said that the work done

“I think it's another ex-
ample of how it's so easy to
get weapons in the United
States. I don‘t think stricter
gun laws will be passed with
the current conservative re—
gime,with Bush [in Ofﬁce].l
1 think stricter gun laws would
the ideal, but I don't know
how many people would
have to be killed or hurt for
that type of change to come

 

about. "

thlddic Allen ’10

“I think having more
stringent gun laws would be
a great preventative measure,
but I think there are always
going to be ways to bypass
the entire system. Even if
we have more stringent gun
laws, I think events like Vir-
ginia Tech will still happen,"

Briscoe. He talked about predatoiy drug test kits,which will be
available through security or the health center.

- The Reform Committee presented proposed changes
to the Constitiitioii.]oiiit Board debated the topic and Unml'r
mously approved a smdenttwide election concerning said
changes. The election will be held Within the next two weeks.

- Joint Board approved requests by wind energy Supt
porters to present their case before the trustees at the Octo~
bet meeting. Turbine proponents argued that the wind turbine
project has been stonewalled by the college.

' Three budgets came before Joint Board this week.
waltz (57000), Black Diamond stoppers from Chicago
(31280), and the contested budget for the Underwear Ball pIer
party (5190) were all approved as requested.
