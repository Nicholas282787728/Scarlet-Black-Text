on Sunday, March 11, Joint Board held an emergency sCSe
sion to discuss the outcome of an election process that had
started a week earlier but was still mired in uncertainty. On FH’
day, March 9, Election oard held a run~off election between
Eric Olson '08 and C n Caimody'OS for SGA Vice-Presi-
dent ofAcademic Affa' (VPAA). Soon after, an anonymous
student ﬁled a grievance with Election Board. questioning 017
son's campaign tactics; Election board recommended .r revote
without Olson on the ballot. Olson appealed the decision, fol
which the SGA Constitution tequiied an emergency Joint
Board session; at that mcctlng,JolI\t Board elected to suspend a
provision ortlre constirution, and the election results, showing
Olson had won,were then n-iadc public,

Upon hearing that he was in a runott election Thursday,
IVlarch 8, Olson asked his friend and Loosehcnrl Senator Laura
Lienernanrr ’08 {0 poster for him. Liencmaiin had already ofe
feted to help at least three times previously. according to Olson,
“It was done on a friendly level," he said.

Lienemann also sent an email out to fifteen friends, asking
them to vote {oi Olsonr The 36!)? obtained the e-mail from an
anonymous source who did not receive the original email. In
the email, chrremann Wrote “I know {or many oryou, I'm not
your senator anymore..." and later, “I’m sending this to you to
tell you why] voted for Eric Olson — you can make your own
decision,just hear me out." Licnemann did not mention this
email to Olson. '

According to Election Board member and SGA Treasurer
Brad Bishop '08, Election Board decided that both Lienemann’s
pestering and Email violated Article III Section 1 ofthe SGA
Bylaws,which prohibits the sending of“...material promoting

’ any candidate...tlrrouglr campus mail, or through unsolicited
e-mail” and “...candidates from soliciting SGA Senators to
distribute any campaign materials"

While the C’l‘ﬂﬂil was considered aviolation, Election Board
chose not to cite this violation as a reason for the second runoff.
According to Bishop, the posters were sufficient justiﬁcation
and basing their decision on both violations would have “u“,
necessarily confused people."

Olson's runroff campaign also included posters with pier
rurcs of current SGA VicerPresidcnt Michael Billups ’07 and
Olson, who have been friends since Olson's first year. “I was

' just looking for some new, funny material [in my posters],"
said Olson. some ottlrc posters included pictures ofBillups
knighring a kneeling Olson. Additionally, SGA Administrative
coordinator Nick Blcncowc ’08 hclpcd Carmody poster during
the runoff campaign. While current cabinet members are not
prohibited from endorsing oi helping candidates, the practice
is considered atypical.

Olson received 558 percent of the 451 total votes cast in
thc run-off. Butbcfore he CVCI' found out these stilts F ’

Students wasting more food in dining hall

Bv CID STANDIFER

Last , year, during the construction and
planning or the JRC, Director omitting strr
vices Dick Williams sought to reassure en-

‘ Cnml.ly concerned students about the
'5 food waste. He said the new cooks
torordcr system would drastically cut back on
the amount of food thrown away at the end of
each meal.

According to Dining services employees,
the cook»to-order~ system wastes less food in
the preparation stage, but the amount being
ordered has remained the same. Employees
believe that this may be because students are
wasting more.

one cook (who asked to remain anonye
mous since she said dining hall employees have
previously been berated (or giving interviews
to the S83) said that the amount her sta~
tion wastes is negligible. “I very seldom throw
anything away
at my station,"
she said. "If it is,
it’s probably less
than a serving,
because when I
have leftovers for
lunch. we save
it because it can be
used.. .foi‘ dinner."

Mary Ahltprist ’07,
who has worked in
dining for tour years,
said that food preparanon for lines that are not
cookrtororder, such as the “homerstylc star
tion" and “vegan bar," has also decreased, “The
amount that the cooks make up in the back...
is actually less since there are all the othci star
tions,"shc sard. “So qilitc lr-cqrrcntly well run
out of.. whatever it is that they're making, and
nor have to throwaway rwo hig pr 5 oror
that they've made jusl in use they run our,"

”Illere’: much more waste from
sluderrls taking more food than
what they’ll ear. ...far more than
What we overprepare ”
Lyle Bauman,
'Dining Services Supervisor

Dining lrrrll Supervisor Lyle Baunran
agreed. “There’s much more waste from
the students taking more food than what
they'll cat, by far
more than what
we , ovei~prer
pare,» he said.
Aceordrng to
Bauman, work-
ers on the dish
line frequently
see whole Sande
wiches being
thrown away
untouched.

Despite the
cooks’ decrease
in waste, the anonymous cook believes little
extra is actually being saved because students
are throwing more food avmy “If you had to

go through a serving line, you
took what you wanted," she
said.‘"I think that here. [diners]
just go to all the stations...and
I think they get too much food
at one time.”

Ahlqu‘rsr said she probably
wastes about a plateful of food
at each meal. "It‘s just the way
they have it set up,” she said,
“You don't see everything at
once and then decide.You have
to wait until you walk around
and Filter through." This rncans that she’ll
take a serving of everything that looks good.
whether or not she can finish it.

Krista Clarke ’07 sard part or the problem
may he rho amount of variety available. She
said “It seems like we pay so much money,
so [dining decides] Oh, we need [0 supply it
tlrvcrsity or oprions,‘ but rhcre’s no way that
people are gorng to car all orrhat food."
