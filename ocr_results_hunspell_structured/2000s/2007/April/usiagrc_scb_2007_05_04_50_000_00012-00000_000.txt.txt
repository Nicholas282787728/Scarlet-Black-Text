A wish list from the S&B staff for next year

A lot of great people work hard at keeping
this campus running, and we really appreciate
it. Here are some questions and suggestions for
how we can make our campus even better:

- More oflrcampus collegemwned houses.
Next year there will be three themed houses,
the first time since 2003. Why not add more?
There are lots ofambitious and creative groups
ofsrudents committed to building community
at Grrnnell.

~ Improved and cheaper shuttle service.
On the last days of break, students are often
stranded for hours at the airport, For a school
thal prides itsclt on geographical divetsity,
helping rarttltmg students get there and back
again should be a priority

- No more tuition raises without legitimate
reasons. If the trustees purportedly raised ttir
irion so that we don’t seem cheap, why are we
advertising our “Best Value"status on the front
page of the website? You know how we hate
hypocrisy.

- More parking. Lots of students who want
permits can’t get them. And while the college

spent millions on new buildings, they did not
create enough parking space to make them we
ally accessible for community members and
offtcarripus students.

- Community service funding and support.
The CSC should have a
generous budget, ample _., ,, a“ _ _
staff, and an easy time se-
ouring necessary resources.

- Cheaper Grill prices.
Despite overhead due to
student wages and prl-
fcring, milk and cookies
should not cost 200 percent more than they
do in town,

- Outdoor classesThey'rc all over the liter-
ature the college sends prospics,but we should
have more springtime scholarly frolicks,

- Faster feces of machines on campus.
VVhrle it's our fault that the paper due in five
minutes isn't ﬁnished, it's also annoying to ﬁnd
that the toner is out just when we need it.

' Unlocked doors in the JRC (both outside
and inside) when it's open, There is nothing

' Staff Eoltrarlitii"

more frustrating than having to walk further
than you have to in five degree weather be-
cause the doors are locked.

- Building turbines on campus. We have
one at CERA, and we should get at least one

on campus. The studies
, have been done, the facts are
there, and all that's missing
is the vote. It seems ecoe
nomrcally and cnvironmcm
tally advantageous, What
are the trustees waiting for?
~ A real discussion on
selftgovernancc. Wasn't there an SGA self
govcrnance reform document crcatcd recentl
It's time to reassess what selftgovernanec to
ally means and howwc can make it a reality.

- A computer in Bucksbium. The e-mail
kiosk finally appeared at the end ofFall semes-
ter and then quickly disappeared Art majors
check their email, too.

- A window from the publications office
to the outside world. This is really the only
thing we want.

A guide on how not stress over finals

It happens every year. Shirtless students
lounge in the sun on Cleveland beach, Dag
players retreat from the old PEC to right in
front of the bookstore, and l realize that with
finals rapidly approachingl haven't gone to
class in three weeks. It?
rials is that pesky monster
that happens right when
everything else in youi
life is absolutely perfect,
when the sun is shining
and you’ve almost forgotten your embarrassing
hookrups and your parents have given up tryr
ing to contact you with “urgcrit'etmails about
renewing your financial aid. It's like catutg a
delicious cake and their finding out that, oh
no, there's a dismembered ﬁsh in the middle
ofrt. And no matter how we try, we can't avoid
it; finals is approaching like a lumbering cams
pus train, and while you can stand on the train
tracks and pretend it’s not there, you’re still go,
ing to get hit.

Enough ofthese completely useless analo-
gies, though. I've survived three finals weeks
so far with only minor emotional scarring, so
maybe I can lend a hand to make your finals
week easier, Because you know what they say:
finals come and finals go, but psychological
damage from a professor writing, c you
kidding?"on your Soc, final lasts forever.

I think the first thing to remember
during ﬁnals week is that professors are hut
man. (I knowl l was shocked tool I thought
they were stealthy creatures of the night who
only came out during the day to feed on our
pain, but 1 was wrong!) kidding aside, profes-
sors have work during finals week too, You
can tell that a professor is trying to sidcrstep
that work when he or she starts to use tactics
like, “Let's do a project where you guys grade

Rachel Fields '09
The “Rachel

your own papersl“1 mean, let's be honest, in
were a professor, l’tl totally do that It makes
students think you're liberal and frecrthrnking
when realistically, it inst gives you more time to
watch reruns of“ero's the Boss>" Anyway, my
point is that most prof sors.
if confronted with a clilelly
stressed student, won't res
spoud like robots. lf you’ic
overwhelmed with \vork/
fighting a rapidly spreading
rash/fighting a rapidly spreading plague of lot
cirsts,just tell them the truth, In the end,it'11
make your finals week better, and you won’t
have to guiltily ignore any more of those pesky
“urgent exclamation pointl"crnails.

2.The best way to relieve stress (that I can
write about in this column, at least) is a good,
old-fashioned study break. Study breaks are
my favorite thing about finals week, which
is perhaps why 1 should probably be leaving
Grinnell and attending Snowdrop com-
munity College. The key to successful study
breaks is that they should be short, fun and
not too distracting. There is a distinct differs
encc bctwcen taking a break to hang out with
your bcst friend Jack and your best friend Jack
Daniels, ifyou know what] meanTherc's also
the problem that if you start doing something
like watching TV or checking Plans, suddenly
it will be 5:00 pm the next day and you'll have
no idea where you are. Honestly, my favorite
kind ofstudy break is going to the bathroom.
That might say something weird and bad
about my personality, but it's really the only
study break you can take without feeling guilty
about it. “I shouldn’t liavc taken that uap,"you
might say later, or, “I shouldn't have stopped
for three hours to watch ‘My super sweet 5in
tecrt',"But has anyone ever said,“God, I would

have gotten an A on that final if 1 just hadn't
gone [0 the bathroom yesterday!"

3, Most people feel pietty bad during fir
ttals wcck, that’s a given 7 but if possible, you
should piobably avoid making other people’s
stress bonanzlls even worse. During finals
week, it’s itdlly tempting to put on your Plan a
big list ofcvcrything you have to do. Don't get
me wrong, some people put these up as air ac-
tual reminder to themselves 7 but there are al-
ways those people who make the lists to show
everyone else that they are ‘sooo stressed,'TIic
battle ofstrcss at Grinnell is constant and tag
ing; you can't mention that you have a paper
to write wrthout someone saying, “Oh yeah?.‘
Weill have set papers,a thrccdlour lab,and an
obligation to cure caneerl"

wouldn't it be great if, during finals week,
we could all just step back and talk about
something other than our work? Because realt
istieally, when you're listcniug to someone talk
about how much they have to do, all you’re re-
ally thinking about rs how you’d rather be eat-
ing a panini or checking your email.

Sure, finals week sucks; it’s long, frustratr
ing, and if given the choice between taking a
two pm. Friday final and getting sthwasted at
Block Party, I think we all know which one
I'd choose. But like it or not, it’s one of those
things that makes college a complete experi-
cncc,]ust like salt wouldn’t be the same With
out sugar and humanities wouldn't bc the same
without (shudder) science, our free-spirited
romps wouldn't be the same without a healthy
dose ofstress.

It's finals week that makes us appreci-
ate those happy times e the times when we
walk out of ARI—l at 5:00 pm, hear the roar-
of drunken belligerence in the distance, and
think, “Man, lit]: is sweet.”
