October 5, 2007

BYJAMES AN I‘HOFER

When members of Concerned Black Students (CBS) re
turned to campus this semester, they had one goal in mind:
emphasizing the role of the black community on campus and
fostering a greater sense of community. “Right when we got
back to campus, we started planning the events,“said Nate Clay
’08, president of CBS. “VVc’rc also having study sessions where
people can come and work together."

To strengthen rhis community and promote an increased
awareness of AfricanrAmcrlcan thought and scholarship,
membcts of CBS sponsored Black Awareness Week last week
through a series of panels and discussions aimed at examining
the role ofblack women and men on campus.

The black commllnity at Grinnell is one of the strongest
voices for increased cooperation on campus, yet many snidents
on campus are unaware ofthc pressures facing this close knit
group. I<csho Scott, Sociology, talked Wednesday about how
future fights to unite black students will require the same dedi—
cation as previous eftorts. Activism IS a lifestyle” .it is a con-r
mitment you make and an analysis ofevery choice ofyour life,”
she said, "It is very important that you have young enthusiasm
to help you get our ofrhe box.”

At a Wednesday evening presentation and game night,
Trustee Bob Austin ’54 spoke about the importance of creat-
ing connections between current students and alumni in facing
future challenges Black students will face.

Earlier in the week, director of Student Financial Aid Are
nold Woods emphasized the importance of education in pro
moring a cohesive black community “Probably an average loan
debt will be about $100,000 for a professional program,"he said
of efforts to fund higher education. Woods added that college
ﬁnancial aid ofﬁces can offer important help to black students
trying to continue their education.

Black Awareness Week concludes today with a presentation
bv visiting scholar l<ofi Boye-Doc. CBS has more community
building events planned. Soon, CBS will sponsor a Hip Hop

One is the luck of health care infrastruc-
turc. A lack of huiniln resources. There are
some estimates that for Subrthninn Afiicn,
they would need an extra million health care
workers to address what they nced to do now
.. A third is this issue of “mobile men with
money". Ifyou'vc got “inobilc men with mone

Do you think the US is do-
ing enough to stop AIDS?

The Global Fund is one part
of what our government is do-
ing. It's a portion ofa inuch bige
gcr project, called the President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Re-
lief (PEPFAR). In 2003 presis

 

sexual relationships, you're going
to have what l’etcr Piot [execu-
tive ditcetor of UNAIDS] called
“the perfect storm."

Could you talk a little about
the controversy surrounding
PEPFAR and tying its aid to
abstinence education?

There’s clarity on how much

 

 

dent Bush set aside $15 billion
forAlDS relief. And the Global Fund’s budget
comcs out of that fund It’s more than has
ever been done before. Is it enough? No. Con»

gress right now is debating a fiveryear renuthor
rization ofPEPFAR at a level of 830 billion.

What do you think is most effective in
combating HIV/AIDS?

I think for all of our work, either dcvcl-
opmcnt work or creative work, it is to listen
to your clients. To not have a prescribed ap-
proach to interventions and answcrs, but to be
open and listen and have the community tell
you might what work better Another lesson
I’ve learned is ﬂexibility. Whenever I see proje
ccts fail, and I've seen a lot ofthcm, one of the
reason is frequently a lack of ﬂexibility Being
rigid around timetables and being rigid around
expectations for results given the reality. But
tlints sort ofu universal truth. I think a third
one is being humble.

Why do you think the AIDS crisis has
become such an epidemic speciﬁcally in poor
countries?

should go to prevention. And
that’s 20 percent of the budget, And prevent
tion includes being abstineiit, bcing faithful
and condotn use. And evidence is clear that
the three together are working. Within the
prevention, 33 percent of the budget goes to
abstinence education, but when you do the
math on that, it’s 7 percent ofthe total. So it's
not as huge as some people think it is, On the
other hand, evidence is showing that the three
together work well.

How did Grinnell prepare you for your
work with AIDS and your overall career?
Fabulously There are probably a couple
things that are really key. One of them was the
skills to be able to think and look at problems
in different ways. And also, frankly. to apply
for the Watson fellowship and get one. That
launched me, being able to graduate out of
Grinnell and be able to go study in three Latin
American countries.Tlic most important long
term piece was rhc analytical skills. And prob-
ably also the tolerance for diversity

Date Rape

the feeling ofsafcty here," Coleman continued,
“but you don't know eveiybody."

Though Theresa says her incident hasn’t
changed the way she views parties, she still
hasn't been to a party since it happened. Ra-
clicl said she no longer feels comfortable at
parties. “There's a premeditntion behind it
that’s disturbing, even more so than the event
itself." Rachel said, adding, “I'm really worried
about 10/10.”

Since none ofthc incidcnts in recent ycars
have cndcd in assaults, Sccurity ofﬁcers have
no conclusive ideas about who to suspect for
thc predatory dtu ggings. Especially with a
date rape drug, its verv hard to track down
suspects, explains Lieutenant Coleman. “’lts
hard to pinpoint anyone with evidence"

With lots of questions and no real answers,
l-{ilid- Brush said,‘ “There: nothino we can re-
ally do but educate people Hinds Brush said
she’s seen student interest in date rape drug' is-
sues rise, along with the incidents, since she
arrived at Grinnell two years ago. but predar
toiy drug use is a notoriously underreportcd
criinc because its symptoms are nebulous and
involving police may add to the already intense
emotional fallout ofbeing dnigged.

As Rachcl expressed, “You keep running
through other alternatives because the date
rape drug scenario is so confusing” But, said
Health Center Director Kim Cochran, the
students’ stories don’t seem to have any other
real explanation. Cochran urged students who
think they may have been drugged to use one
of the date rape dnig test kits available on
campus, which can detect drugs in the body
up to 842 hours after they’ve been ingested.

In the wake of the recent incidents, Sc-
curity and RLCs hope Grinnellians will take
more precautions that many students forget
within the safe small college bubble. Simple
things like not leaving di-inks unattended
and sticking close by friends at parties can
seem like paranoia in the friendly, tightrknit
Grinnell community “'lve seen those bulletins
go out but I nevei really thought it was that
had, said Rachel.‘ lncvcr kncwitwouldnffcct
me as much as it did "
