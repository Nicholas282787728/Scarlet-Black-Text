Campus GOP
walks softly

BY CHRIS NEUBERT 8c PAUL CARLSON

While Campus Democrats are busy stir»
ring up a frenzy of support on campus for the
upcoming caucuses, the Campus Republicans
so far have been content to lie low, waiting for
right time to present their issues. While the
group's dozen members have no plans to die
vide into support groups for individual cant
didatcs, the Campus Republicans, along with
the Powcshiek County Republicans, are still
preparing for an active year on campus.

Campaign Noteboo GOP

Traditionally, the Republicans on campus
prefer an understated role in campus politics.
“Not everyone agrees with the campus Dem
tactics,"said Derek Batcs'OS, a former leader of
the group, "We're trying to build up our Credt
ibility .. . to be able to notjust play defense."

Yet at the beginning of the school year it
was unclear whether there would even be a
Republican group on campus. There was no
table at the Activities Fair for the Campus Re-
publicans, and posters advertising the club did
not appear until the day after an appearance
in town by Republican presidential candidate
sam Brownback. And instead of actively sup-
porting candidates, the main objective of the
Campus Republicans will be informational.

, “We want people to be informed," said co-
lcadct Valerie Stimac '09. “To know what
they're voting on."

One reason that the Campus Republicans
keep a low profile is because Republicans are
stigmatized on campus. “Once snidents get
here,” Bates said. "If they aren’t a part of [a libs
cral ideology] they keep it to themselves."

Colonel Dan 'Bunnell, the college's for-
mer director of Forensics and a leader of the
Poweshiek County Republicans, called Re—
publicans on campus an “endangered species.”

“There is an enormous amount of pressure
to not be a Republican," Bunnell said. “This
social pressure tends to discourage people.”

Instead, Republicans simply encourage
students to consider alternative points of view.
“Part of education is being able to hear oppov
ing views,” Bunnell said. “Ifthey’re going to be

able to debate, they need to understand both ‘

sides of the issue."

Republicans have also traditionally op»
posed widespread student participation in lo-
cal elections. “At least recognize the impact,"
Bunnell said, encouraging students to avoid
casting a “blind vote."

In addition, the group hopes to bring Re-
publican speakers to campus, either alone or as
part of an opportunity to debate their Liberals
minded counterparts. "It would be great to get
presidential candidates to come to campus,"
Bates said.“Ifa Republican can come speak at
Grinnell, that says a lot."

Rule of law and Nuremburg letters

Presidential Candidate Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) stumps for votes in Grinnell

liv Dn‘vm H. MONTG OMERV

The Saints Rest coffeehouse hosted the
first Grinncll visit by a Democratic presiden-
tial candidate this Saturday, when Sen. Chris
Dodd (Conn) stopped by to speak answer
questions and sign copies ofhis new book.

Dodd,who is trailing more prominent can-
didates in both fundraising
and polling, was upbeat
and deﬁant in his com—
ments. He expressed hope
about his prospects in the
race, but delivered a mes~
sage emphasizing his pet
Cause: the rule oflaw.

“It’s one of the things I care most about,
and I'm worried that not enough Americans
do, and it‘s one of the reasons I'm running for
the presidency” Dodd declared in his speech.
"Each generation has a responsibility to up-

”Each generation has 0 [65(10an
bl/l'ly m uphold the rule of/aw.”
Sen. Chris Dodd (D—ConnJ

hold the rule of law. And we have just gone
through sit years of an administration that's
doing everything but
upholding it—in fact,
doing everything they
can to dismantle it.”
Dodd was speaking to promote both his
candidacy and his new
book, Lcllm' From Nannie
burg. The book is fairly une
usual for a campaign book:
it’s not a manifesto or a
biography, but a collection
of letters written by Dodd’s
father Thomas while he was
serving as a high-ranking prosecutor in the
Nuremburg trials.
"1 know in campaigns like this, you’re sup—
posed to publish books that would tell you how

I was going to :mdicnte ignorance, poverty and

in pa i

‘I Note

disease in the first two years of my administrar
tion,"Dodd said to laughter. He read two let-
ters which were touching

D or] d

in their appreciation for
the momentous Nuremc
burg proceedings and their heartfelt romance.
After speaking for over half an hour, Dodd
opened the ﬂoor up to questions from the au»
dience, answering queries ranging from AIDS
to Israel to Dodd’s call for a carbon tax.
Campus Democrats codeader Alec Schic-
renbeck ’09, who helped to arrange Dodd’s
visit, said the small-scale eventwas successful.
“It's awesome to see a candidate like Barack
Obama got these huge crowds," schierenbeck
said, “but it's also nice to have a candidate
come and not need police barricades and just
sort oflistcn to him and ask him questions in u
more intimate settings than a mob at the Uni-
versity of Iowa."

Sen. John McCain discusses health care at Grinnell hospital

uvMARKJArlNGA

I made my first ever trip to the Grinnell chional Medi-
cal Ccnter this Wednesday, but I wasn’t sick. Instead, I joined
about 40 other people, most of them hospital employees and
all of them at least 15 years older than me, in welcoming Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz) to Grinncll, his first stop in Iowa in
out i month and the beginning ofa tcuewotl bid for support
in the state.

McCain; visit was preparation for a Dcs hloincs speech

Thursday outlining his new health care planThe plan emphac
sizes competition, with importation of Canadian prescription
drugs and health care "vouchers." For supporters ofthe culrent
health care system, it sounded like a good incremental reform.
forcing health insurance companies to compete for custom .

The speech itself included a share ofhits and misses. Mc~
Cain scctncd to regii-d this campaign stop as a practice lun, is
he often lookttl down at out cards placed on his porlnun But
when he wasn't speaking in health t. ‘ rgon, hit-Cain \\':l\ his

usual, affable self, frequently poking fun ofhimsclf and repeat-
edly asking for “questions, comments or complaints."

McCain wouldn’t get any complaints, or much emotion at
all from the crowd, most of whom sat quietly and applauded
when necessary.

No one needs a jumprsrrlri to his presidential campaign
more thin McCain. who barely hit ﬁve percent in a recent Der
Monti Rtgn poll, If this ttop ' y intllciltitm, though. his
campaign hasn't i-tihetl itselfqui . t.
