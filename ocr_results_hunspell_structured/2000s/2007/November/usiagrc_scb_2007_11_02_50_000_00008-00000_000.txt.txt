Whatever the reason, cars can be undeniably
useful when attending a smallrtown liberal-
arts college.

But as class sizes increase and campus
buildings go up, it's not hard to scc too many
cars and too few parking spaces. leading some
to ask how Important it really is to have a car
on campus.

“I don’t feel like I need one,“ said Erick
Skelnik '09. “I think people who bring ears just
let them stand in the parklng lot. There isn't
anywhere In Grinnell to drlve to."

Others disagree. id rather have my car,
said Elizabeth Maltby ’11. “I like having it
here. Part of' It
is knowing
that if I did
need to go
somewhere
I could get
there."

Despite
increasing
enrollment,
it does not
appear that
there are
more cars
on campus
than in past
years.

In 2005, the school
sold 390 permits; in 2006,

385 were sold. ThIs year, 279
have been sold at time ofpress, but that numr
her will continue to increase throughout the

Security.

“We'll probably be somewhere around that
area again,” he predicted. Briscoe said that
there is no cap on the number of parking per-
mits sold each year; the amount ofpermirs has
no relation to the number of parking spaces
available on camp .

While not limiting the number or spaces
gives students freedom to bring their cars, it
leads to what most agree Is the biggest obstacle
for students with keys and an engine: parking,

There is usually a shortage of spaces
around the residence halls, with parking gene
crally easier the farther one gets from campus.
“We always have the spaces,”suid Briscoc,“lt's
just that people want something really close to

For instance, behind Darby, a
student, faculty and staff lot sits
unused, and for many an
known. “Nobody parks in

it at all,” said Briscoe.

hand when she parked her car in the front
Darby lot, and got a 520 ticket. Because she
saw no other parking available on North Came
pus, Fleck ﬁled an appeal to revoke the ticket,
arguing that she had parked in the corner and
that the lot had plenty of free space, both at
the time and habitually throughout the year.

“I'm not in a faculty space, I'm not in a
handicapped space, there's not a {no lane,” she
said.

When her appeal was denied, she was
frustrated that no one provided an explanation
and felt the system of ticketing to be bizarre.
“Without my parking permit displayed in the
windshield, [the ticker] would've been 510,"
she said. “[But] they were able to document
which car it was and know that it belonged [0
Inc, and I had to pay 320."

But dcspire problems with the current lots,
it's unlikely that any new parking lots will be
added closer to the residence halls in the near
future. “The 'campus has decided that they
dont want to put a lot
of parking lots in the

said Maltby, who lives in Read.

“I don't think there are that many prob
lems to having
a car here. It’s
not as hard to
ﬁnd parking as
people claim,”
agreed Sean
Warlick ’08.
“They don’t
want to pay a
fee, but it's not
terrible. I have a friend who pays 9500 a sec
mestcr to palk at Creighton, so whatever It is
here Is not bad at all. “

waIlicks friend at Creighton is one of
many students who pay higher prices for park
Ing permits. According to Btiscae, Grinnell
College subsidize: the cost of maintaining lots,
rather than charging actual cost.

"student parking permits are set) a year.
But that doesn'r begin
to pay for the cost of

Briscoc, "The college

Since Grrnnell keeps its prrces low, many
can afford to bring their cars even ifthey don't
use them much. “If it wasn’t for the fact thatI
occasionally used to go to WalrMarl, It would
just sit in thc parking lot,"Maltby said.

Others don’t think a car is w0I lh the hassle.
