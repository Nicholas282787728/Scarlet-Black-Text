Transformers
(2007)

Flawed entertainment,
but fun nonetheless

The threat was imminent: Michael Bay,
not one of the better-liked directors in Hol-
lywood, was helining the Timiifanndrl movie.
But surprisingly. aficr warching the ﬁlm, 1
concluded that Bay did not spit in the face of
every American’s childhood after all,

The plot is simple: an alien civil war (rhe
Autohcts vs. the evil Decepricons) has spilled
onto Earth, and young sam is caught in the
fray by his newly purchased soupcd-up Cama-
ro, which has a mind and an identity ofits own
as a noble warrior robot named Bumblebee.

The story is as old as the Greeks versus the
Trojans, the difference being that these ware
riors are visitors from another planet, and there
isn’t ajot of poetry, tragedy, beauty, meaning or
interest in this fight. But the execution of this
rather trite and cheesy plot was superb, and
credit should go to the whole crew.

The best performance of the movie comes
from Bay through his expert handling ofrhe
script. The actors (Shia Labeouf, Megan Fox,
John Turturro and Jon Voight, among others)
are pretty much there because it is a movie and
it needs actors. To their credit, they do their
job adequately

The movie raises the bar for special ere
fects: the Autobots and Decepticons feel heavy
and absolutely real in every frame they're in,
There are long, lingering shots ofthe models
in full light, and I couldn‘t find a CGI charao
(or that pulled me our orrht movie or made
me think 1 was seeing something rhar wasn't
actually there.

Punk is not dead.

right scary world.

Mad scientist Krank (masterﬁrily played by
Daniel Emilfork) Lives on a rig-turned-labora-
tory with a group of servile clones, a disem-
bodied brain in a vat and several other charac-
ters with affectedly strange looks and personas.
He and his cohorts are in the business ofkid-
napping children and stealing their dreams.
You see, poor Kranit cannot dream, and as a
result, ages with abnormal rapidity. Amongst
his captives is Denice (Joseph Lucien), rhe
lirric brother of circus strongman one (Ron
Perlman). The heauriﬁil young orphan Miette
(Judith Vittet) joins one, and together, they
embark upon a mission to rescue Denree from
his sinister captors.

Directors Jean—Pierre Jenner and Marc
Caro resurrecr familiar fantasy concepts such
as a gentle giant, a gaunt villain and a precor
ciously rough little girl. The question is: can
a work of art achieve originality through the
sheer number of sources upon which it draws?
In other Wolds, is there potential for profuir
diry and beauty in the act of cutting and past
in ?

have come to believe that it is more impressive
and worthwhile to derive deftly than to cre-
ate clumsily.This film does not bring anything
radically new to the table; however, it makes
for a ﬁne dinner guest, capable of charming us
with a plethora of borrowed stories, characters,
images and ideas.

The world that the film’s characters inhabit
is like a Dali painting brought to life. Dynamic
cinematography allows us to explore every
nook and cranny of this surrealist, postrapock
lyptic world. The ettorts of Jenner and Caro
pay off, for any sighted person will feel like a
part of the action.

Unfortunately, our connection to the story
is more sensory than emotionalThe ﬁlm carer
lessly combines unoriginal children’s themes
with dark surrealism, such that its overall tenor
seems dissonanr. Luckily, the delicate treats
ment ofOne's and Miette’s relationship makes
up for the rest of the film's emotional inace
cessihiliry. Their understated journey toward
friendship illustrates the nature of happiness
more c ecltvely than the actionrpiickcdjoure
ney that drives the plot.
