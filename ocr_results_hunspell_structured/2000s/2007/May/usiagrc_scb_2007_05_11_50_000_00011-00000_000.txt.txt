Piano man,
plant man

Perusing information on applying to large
American state schools from his home in
South Korea, Ben Kim discovered something
new on the lmernct, “I siiw this thing called
‘liberiil arts colleges' and I was like ‘whlit the
hell are they?” i—ie applied to Gnnnell with
out even looking at the website. Grinnell gave
him the most ﬁnancul aid and the next fall he
was on a plane to the middle oflowli.

Kim’s time in Grinnell will not end with
graduation; he is planning on returning as a
ninthssemester fellow in music. He plans to
continue his work wuh three independent
compositions and remain as involved in the
music community as he has (luring his unden
graduate tenure.

“When I got here I started taking music
classes," Kim said, “I took harmony ﬁrst set
mcster.That’s where it all started."

After that first class, Kim
went on to direct the mus
sic for sis Nevcrland Players
performances, two Crinncll
Independent MuSical Prof
duetion (GIMP) productions
(last semester's “Urinetown” and this scmcsV
ter's “Hello Again") and played piano in the
GIMP production “Floyd Collins".

Although music is a latge part of Kim's
life, his parents have not always been support-
ive of his choice of discipline.They made him
quit the piano after sitth grade and encour»
aged him to focus on other studies, hoping
that one day he would become a doctor.

When his parentsvisited two weekends
ago for lus senior recital, they met Eugene
Grub, MuSlc, whom Kim has been raising
piano lessons with. “My mom met Professor

also half seriously.

However, his parent's aspi-
rations for him have not gone
unliecdcd. Kiln does not want to become a
doctor, but he is double majoring in Music
and Biology, and will continue to pursue both
diseiplincs lifter Grinncll, After Kim's Music
fellowship at Grinneli ends, he plans to enroll
in a masters program in composition at the
University of Cilgary. then to get a PhD in
composition. But Kim would also like to get a
PhD in plant ecology.

Kim acknowledges the daunting nature of
such a long commitment to schooling, “That's
what, like 13, 14 years?"he said. “When I'm
done with both degrees, I'll be like 40’somcs

Kim says he can handle that much more
school because he doesn't want to eompro-
mise either of his passmiis. “It‘s not that I
don't want to choose," said Kim. “It's that I
can't choose'fo have either one he marginal

handle the two different areas of study Very
well,“I can do two things at once," he said.

Immediately after his Grinnell gradu-
ation, though. he plans to lbcus strictly on

Despite Dag's notoriety as a
distinct, tightrknit campus group,
Miller said he has never rc-

his fellow fighters and other
