For first-years,
System requires
adjustment

rsvjaroauc

Outside of our bubble, little is known of
the the System, Grinnell’s torrid offensive
which consistently produces scorcs in the
triple digits. First-years that decide to play
here must leave the normalcy of high school
basketball, where they play several minutes at
a time and are likely the stars of their team.
Upon arrival, they are thiust into a foreign
environment that encourages rampant three-
point shooting, constant full court presses and
one-minute shifts on the ﬂoor.

“Most players who come heic weie starters
on their high school team and used to playing
25-30 minutes a game," said head coach Dar
vid Atseneatilt. “So it is a considerable adjust
ment to have them leain how to play full out
foi 33 seconds to a minute."

The intensity is especially evident for play
ets who roam the perimeter.

“The new point guards have a lot higher
learning curve because there is no patterned
offense," said forward Alex McDonald ’11,
“They have to create what shots the team
gets."

"Right now we have cnough scorers on thc

squad," said McDonald. “1 play defense and

Any athlete that joins the college game
will naturally go through an adjustment pe-
riod, given the jump from high school to the
NCAA level. But the System requires inten-
sity on the court for short bursts and requires
all the players to think on their feet. Most
other colleges preach peifection on both de—
fense and on offense, while Grinnell focuses
far more on hustle.

Some firstryeats must transition from bar
ing the star of the team to becoming a role
player. “I had no idea what was going on,”
said Kale Knisley ’11, an Iowa Class 1A all
state forward at Rockwell City—Lytton High
School and a candidate for the McDonald‘s
Alermerica team. “In fact, I still kind of
don’t."

Currently, Knlsley
averages 12 minutes
and 3.7 rebounds a
game but with time, he
expects that to rise.

But Arseneault
maintains that his plays
ers will fit into the Sysr
tern just as fast as plays
ers in a normal offense
at another school.

“It is a lot easier to adjust to our system
than conventional basketball,"said Arsenenult,

”/IIS a considerable adjustment [0 have

for 35 seconds to a minute.”

probably due to the fact that most ﬁfsﬁyem’s
see playing time in every game, forcing them
to become accustomed to the controlled chaos
that characterizes Grinnell basketball.

Besides, the intic pace of the System
means that all players,
not just firstryeats will
have their share of misc
cues. Focusing on going
all out for the 30 seconds
or a minute that a player
is in the game means far
more.

“The first thing
coach told us in practice
was it’s not what you do," said McDonald. “It's
how fast you do it."

Basketball starts 3-0 in MWC play

With wins over St. Nor-
bert, Carroll and Monmouth
this week, the Pioneer men’s
basketball team’s record ims
proved to 6—1. They currently
sit atop the Midwest Cons
ference standings, essentially
tied With Lawrence, Knox
and Illinois College, who all
sit at 270. The Pioneers play
their final home game of the
semester this Saturday, when
they take on North Central
(Minn) at 1 pm.

Grinnell 100-87 St. Norbert

Down 66—57 early in the
second half, The Pioneers
stormed back, outscoring
their opponents 43721.

John Grotberg '09 led
the Pioneer charge with 31
points, while Mike Schmidt
Y08 scorcd17.

Poor free throw shooting
hurt the Pioneers. The team
shot only 65 percent from the
line, and missed a number of
one-and-ones.

Grinnell 108-93 Carroll

Anyone disappointed with
the Pioneers Friday perfor
mance certainly saw a better
team on Saturday. Grinnell’s
first half was arguably their
best ofthe year, a 57.37 shels
lacking filled with streaks of
threes and great defensive
stands,

With 14 assists, David
Arsenenult '09 put his name
into the record books as the
team’s all-time assists leader.

Grinnell 100430 Monmouth

Leading by 20 points just
12 minutes into the game and
34 at one point in the second
half, it didn't take much for
the Pioneers to defeat winless
Monmouth on Wednesday
night.

Bobby Long '09 led the
Pioneers with 34 points, hits

to cap off a stellar night of
shooting. John Grotberg
chipped in 29.

If Grinnell
basketball players
were pro athletes...

Nothing was more frustrating last year than seeing the
Grinnell basketball team roll through the MVVC regular season
only to lose in the semis of the conference tournament to Lake
Forest, a team they had destroyed less than two weeks earlier. Unr
less Lawrence is far better than predicted, nnothct MWC tout-
mmcnt collapse could be comparable to the ’82-'83 Phi Slama
Jami Olajuwon/Drcxler Houston Cougars. The talent is there,
the system is there, and hcing the only Grinnell sport that is even
remotely watchable,I need them to do well.

I don’t usually care for college basketball until March, but
this hardly counts, since Grinnell's style compares more to that
of hockey in Europe (high scoring, open ice/court, fast action, all
complete with line changes).

So in that spiiit, And the spirit of not wanting to write an en—
tire column about collegc basketball teams with normal offenses,
here’s how I would compare members of the team to those in the
sports world.

David Arseneault is Chuck Knoblauch

I could compare Arseneaalr to a pas first point guard with a
high shooting percentage like Deton Williams, but thats no fun.
Many of you may not remember, but Knobhuch was a hall of
fame player in thc early to mid ’90s But what Knoblauch is best
remembered for was his inexplicable inability to make a routine
throw from second to first lzttc in his career. This makes Knoblauch
the perfect fitbc»
cause Arseneault
(also underrated)
has one ﬂaw in
his game that
makes no sense:
his free throw
shooting ability. How is a gry who shoots over 40 percent from
three have a career free throw percentage that hovers just over 50
percent? 1 just hope that if Keith Olhermann's mom ever decides
to come to a game (after getting hit in the face by an errant Kno—
blauch throw in 2000), she doesn't sit underneath the basket.

John Grotbergis an improved Rex Grossman

Is that Mike Schmidt open on the wingi screw it, I‘m shoot—
ing this 30-footer. Much like Gtossmttn,]ohn has a way of occar
sionally frustrating fans by passing up the seemingly more logical
pass (i.e. a dump ofrto an open man in the ﬂat) in order to chuck
it deep. Sure, both plays are designed to stretch the defense, one
to open up the mediumrlength pass, the other by drawing the
defense to him as soon as he crosses half court, freeing up his
teammates for open looks, but when the deep ball is intercepted
or a frantic three clangs otf the am, it is cringerinducing. But
when either ofthem connect, it can be a thing ofbeauty, and luck»
ily for Grinnell fans, he has a much, much higher rate of success
than Grossmun.

Bobby Long is Maurice “Rocket" Richard

With a stature similar to that of Richard, whether he‘s using
his blazing speed to backreheck on defense, or using his crossover
that can make any defender resemble Keaoy Kennedy, there is just
a certain intensity that Bobby brings to the game. That intensity
can manifest itself in u stupid foul now and then, but for the most
pm it only serves to elevate his game.

Mike Schmidt is MortenAndersen

All Schmidt does is come in, rain threes and take a seat,just
like a kicker. And with much of the offense coming from a trio
of flashy juniors, Schmidt is the restrained elder statesman of the
team. He’s not capable oflaunehing and making shots from sew
eral feet beyond the are like Bobby or John, but he is similar to
Andersen in that he still seems automatic from closer in. But
since it‘s Grinnell basketball, closer in still means three points.

Keith Chamberlain isJean~Sebastian Giguere

When I think of the Ducks goalie,l think of oversizcd pads
blocking the goal, and Keith's o’s" frame makes him a giant by
DIII standards. While Keith can get the crowd on their feet by
throwing down a dunk, the key part ofhis game comes on detense.
Much like Giguere, one of the best shootout goalies in the NHL,
Keith must face a similar type of scenario where offensive players
bear down on him with a seemingly overwhelming likelihood of
scoring. Yet Keith frequently swats the ball into Lhe stands. Bill
Russell wouldn't approve, but the fans certainly do.

Joe Fox is MarkMadsen

I couldn‘t go the whole column without comparing someone
to a basketball player, and this is the perfect ﬁt. Joe Fox, much like
Mark Madsen, usually sits at the end of the bench and gets more
otcited that anyone else in the gym. His stats aren’t all that great,
but when he comes in the game, he brings unparalleled joy to
fans. There's something about both ofthem that makes you want
to cheer whenever they check in. And if/when Grinnell wins the
ch tournament this yeitr,I can only wonder whether Joe Fox’s
dance skills will equal that ofhis awkward white counterpart. The
only word that comes to mind? Dirty.
