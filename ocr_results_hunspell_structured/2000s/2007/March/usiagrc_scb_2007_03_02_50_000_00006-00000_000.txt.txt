By afternoon, a layer of ice encased tree
branches, picnic tables and forgotten bicycles

under clear, slippery sheets. The heavy ice hent .
over trees, snapping enlarge limbs and sending-

them crashing onto sidewalks, power lines and
ears-Just after 2 p.m.;thc power went out on
campus. Students swapped rumors irl loggias
and hallways , some planned campmuts in the
].R.C., which still had some heating and lights
thanks to a generator.

Even after the campus lights ﬂipped back on
ﬁve hours later, greeted with a mixture of groans
and cheers by the cold»sandwieh dinner crowd in
the dining hall, heavy snow continued to fall.The
winter storm transformed the Grinnell landscape.
Throughout the day and night, students bearing
cameras wandered around campus, scampering
fearful under the more threatening trees and pans
ing to marvel at the icicle-draped world.

As ofpress time on Thursday, some students,
faculty and employees who live err-campus and

March 2 2007

townspeople are still without electricity Living
without heat and Lights for days, those who can
have moved into hotels or set up camp on friends’
sofas.

More storms are in store, however. A pre-
recorded message from the Department of
Homeland security rang campus phones on
Tuesday, warning Grinncllians without heat to
“seek shelter." Stress is growing as people without

power head into their sixth day of leftovers and
cold nightsflhose with Lights and heat are settling
in for another, possibly larger, ice storm. They’re
stocking up on canned tuna, ﬂashlight batteries,
candles and enough wine to lasr what could be a
severalrdays blackout. ,

While the ice is beautiful, the unnerving
reality of this fantasybook landscape is quickly
setting in.
