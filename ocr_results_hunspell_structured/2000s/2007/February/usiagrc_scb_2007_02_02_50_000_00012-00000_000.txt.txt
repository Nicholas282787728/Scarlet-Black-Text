We are not the only Grinnellians here

Last week, a student was shot with a pellet gun,
though luckily left unharmed. Whilc we cannot be
sure, the general consensus among Grinnell College
students is that the perpetratoi was a townsperson

who does not attend the college.
This incident—grind the fact that
it has happened beforHstﬂrted
us thinking about the current dy
namic between Grinnell residents
who attend the college and those
who don’t.

Plunking a small, Liberal—
minded, liberal arts college down
in the middle ofa rural Midwest town inevitably cre-
ates an odd dynamic. Unlike in a large city, it's fairly
easy to tell who is a college student and who is not,
For many students, the town of Grinnell is not the
initial draw, and while we may come to appreciate it,
we often don't spend much time offcnmpus. ltwe do
go into town, it is to go to Saints Rest, F&M Bank,,
or McNally's places safely inside the Giinncll stu—
dent “bubble.

It is clear that there is a gulfbetween students and
town resident57but even this distinction is faulty;
technically, college students at: town residents. We
say we are “Grinnellians,” but really, everyone who
lives in Grinncll is a Giinnelllun. Even the term
“towngown” is problematic: who's to say those in
town haven’t worn a gown,or that not having done so
makes someone distinguishable?

This uncomfortable, sometimes antagonistic
dynamic goes both ways. Students get shot at with
pellet guns and catcalled and harassed. Students of
color and gay people sometimes feel uncomfortable

and experience disciimiliat
tion. But students make
disparaging remarks about
“townies"—not only ignor-
ing Grinncll residents who
aren't intimately connected
to the college, but openly
referring to them with con,
temptoreondescension. We
talk about the "sketchy” people we meet in town like
we're superior in some way. Sometimes students are
sclftnghtcous and rude to gas
station cashiers.

No one is specifically re-
sponsible for creating this divide,
Placing blame would only be
counterproductive; we think that
creating a candid dialogue about
that divide with the hope ot‘over-
coming it is more important. We
should call deeptsentcd preju-
dices for what they are: classism, antitintellcctualism,
homophobia, racism, bilt we need to do more than
just identify the problem.

There are plenty ofinstances where students and
townspeople have established gieat relationships. The

These largetseule problems will
not be solved with one editorial or
even a thousand editorials. Deeply
entrenched “isms" are much bigger
than Grinnell, and open-minded ac-
ceptance can feel like a tired adage. But the only way
to address ridiculously largetscalc issues is to work on
a ridicillously small sealczevcryday interactions be

Germany likcs bureaucracy. I get
that. I’ve grown to expect and appre-
ciate the “house rules" hanging up in
practically every train station implore
ing you to treat this domain as ifit were
your own living room by picking up of
ter yourself and your neighbors. After
all, “no rules, no order, and no order, no
comfort."

That's not to say that German 50.
eiety is utterly bereft of deviants. In
fact, most people refuse to wear bike
helmets, and every
now and then in
the tram I'll spot a
drunken "punk" den
crying the “capitalist
locusts" or a berobed
man heading to what
must be some an—
cient Teutonic ritual.
(No jokPl saw one
just last Saturday night!) In general,
though, the Germans seem to have
settled into a pretty comfortable sense
ofordcr and propriety,

This appreciation for the natu—
tal German order or things, however,
gave way to utter bewilderment when
I learned that the Germans are actu-
ally expected to pay for their right to

Although it comes off as being
iathcr silly, the G132 is part ofa broader
social reality that seems absurd merely
because of my vastly different social
assumptions. Being in Germany has
forced me to start recognizing the full
extent of my own capitalist indoctrinat
tion.
