SCA: Stop wasting time

Why is SGA wasting their time wirh the re
cent student initiative? The, purpose of SGA is
to represent the students on student issues, not
to be my political voice. Stop wasting our time
trying ro make change on a “global" scale and
make change here on campus There are many
issues pertinent to campus life which should be
addressed ﬁrst. How about addressing the issues
like making a campus pub a Fteesound practice
space or other things that directly impact the
college?

\ Cookies reflect love life

De1t Dining Selviees,

Im not exactly a "fool for love". In filet,I
spent li good portion of V- -dlly counting down
the minutes to that magical time when ttll the
chocolate goes on sale. Luckily, you've been there
to keep the spirit of Cupid alive and .well on
Grinnell campusifor more than a weekl Sweet!
With every soggy sandwich and every baggie of
carrots was packaged a heart-shaped, slightly—
tomcrunchy delight, by which I knew you meant
“may your love never grow its stale as this cookie."
Thanks for the reminder, DS; my withered heart
is truly touched. XOXO ’

We are handicap accessible

Today, walking into my dorm (Smith),1 noticed
somebody had put a Sign on the door saying “This
is not an equal opportunity entrance, why?" Now, in
SmithJike most of the old dorms, you need to walk
up at least one ﬂight ofstaizs to get anywhere other
than the landing, so for handicap-friendly en-
(mucus to be useful, I assume you would also want
elevators installed in the domis. Now the way I see
it, the college could spend a tor of money modify~
ing the old dorms to be handicap friendly, or they
could do what they did, and spend (probably not
much more) money building an ENTIRE NEW
BLOCK of dorms that are handicap friendly
(namely East Campus) Please explain to me how
your way is better
