Spirited heroes face snakes,

Snakes on a Plane
(2006)

*ttti‘r

It’s deep, we swear.

Kevin: Do we even need to go over
the plot here?

A/ytilz: Nah. Pretty self—explana-
tory. There are snakes. They are on a
plane. Chaos ensues.

1C Actually, Alysia, the mom con—
veys a deep psychological theme. It .ir-
gues that individuals, regardless of the
security they might live in, can never
escape from their fears. Indeed, the
snakes represent a physical manifestae
tion of those fears attacking us, And
it is only With deﬁance, as represented
by Samuel L. Jackson, that we dare to
puncture our inner souls with bullets of
confidence, causing the explosive de-
eompression of the release of all those
fears. Also, boa constrictors are awee
some.

A: Hell yes. In our post-9/11.feilre
filled society, Hollywood craves the
justice vigilante character, embodied in
our favorite bad-ass from Pup Fizlian,
only this time rocking less 'fto.

[c Yes, Jackson does play basically
the same character as he did in Pll/f
Firziml. Not that this is a bad thing.
Indeed, without Jackson’s in»your>facc
attitude that we all know and love, this
movie would have nothing except for
hundreds and hundreds of poisonous
snakes.

A: His godrlike presence on the
plane justiﬁes the lack ofemphasis on
the plot.

K: Exactly, This movie is so good
that it needs only a few minutes of
character development to put it on par
with other sarcallcd “classic" movies
like Gone Wir/J TIM Wind, thus freeing
up the rest of the time for baseball bats
cery, snake hires and pompous English
doctors having their internal organs
crushed. Beautiful.

,4 Not going to lie, I especially
liked that part. But don’t be fooled,
my friend; there was plenty of wide
ranging social commentary. From the
Chihuahuktoting Paris Hilton bimbo
to the self-absorbed R. Kcllyrlike rape
per, the characters were representative
of our classic American stereotypes, all

ofwhich were broken in the Collilbol'ik
tive effort to avoid the appearance ofn
lotvrblldgct hoiror flick.

A: Well, Kevin, the directors and
producers played well to the audiences
desires: samuel L. jackson, profanity
and an awesome title.

K» I agree. Here’s looking forward
to the sequel: Sm Sim/car in n Bum,

Rounders (1998)
*ttt i}

Seedy poker life will in-
terest even non-players

These days, everyonc’s a poker star.
Or at least they believe they are, thanks
to Internet sites that allow any half-wit
14-year-old (er, we mean eryeareold)
to “allein" their way to believmg they are
on their way to winning the next ESPN
World Series of Poker.

The madness has been so wide—
spread that senator Ted Stevens of
Alaska has threatened to shut down the
"series of tubes" through which Ameli-
cans enjoy poker, so they can go back to
more wholesome Internet activities like
gambling on liotserncing and watching
porn. What then is to blame for the
poker obsession threatening the immie
nent destruction of the country’s moral
fablic? Look no further than the movie
Roll/trier: '

Released in 1998, the movie shows
the underground world of people,
known as Rounders, who make their
living by playing poker. Mike McD
(played by Matt Damon) is a law school
student unhappy with simply grinding
out a living at the table, He decides
to take a shot at Vegas, but runs into
top player, the maﬁaetied Teddy KGB
(John Malkovich), and loses all his
money. Forced to work a meniil job to
stdy in school, Mike gives up the game.
McD's story is compelling because he
must choose between a passion (hill
sortie view as morally bankrupt and a
culturally acceptable path that is spiri-
tunlly lacking for him.

It is not until his childhood friend
Worm, a sleazy and conniving charac-
ter played by the very talented Edward
Norton, is released from prison that
Mike’s passion for poke. is reignited.

His girlfriend, the token wet blanket,
cannot handle his return to the game
and leaves him. Soon after, he finds
himself in debt to Teddy KGB because
ofWorm’s actions. He and Worm must
find a \V‘tly to win ﬁfteen thousand dol-
lais or risk the wrath ofKGB.

The strength of Rounder: is that
you don’t have to be a poker player to
enjoy it, In fact, this film is what led
many casual viewers to the poker tables.
Ironically, the seedy, underground nt-
musphere that writers David Levien
and Brian Koppleman rcvealcd is what
helped usher the game into the main-
stream,

Suspend your skepticism
for this feel-good ﬁlm

W/mle Rm/c-i, written and directed
by Niki Cam and based on the novel by
VViti Tame Ihimacrn, is a movie about a
young girl whose ambitions are limited
by what society deems proper fol hel
gendei. something tells me we’ve seen
this before. But although this movie
won’t provide you with any radical twist
on the conventional female empower
iueiit storyline, it is an exceptionally
welleexecuted and moving take on the
concept.

Koro Apirana (Rawiri Paratcne) is
the aging chief of a dwindling Maori
tribe in New Zealnnd, who longs above
all other things for the heir who will
lead the tribe back to prosperity. How-
cvcl, neither of his sons is adequate, and
his only grandson died at birth The
surviving twm, Koro’s txvelve-year»old
granddaughter Pni (the excellent Keir
sha CastlcrHughes) wouldn’t mind
being chief herself, but females are not
permitted to hold the position. From
this premise, things proceed more or
less as you would expect them to.

W/Jn/e Rider succeeds mainly be
cause it is full of warm and lovable
characters. Kort) is an imperfect grand-
father blinded by his need for a male
heir, but he does love his granddaughe
ter and wants what is best for her and
the tribe. Pai is incredibly adorable as
well as strongeivilled and charismatic,

and other characters, such as her far -

ther, uncle and grandmother, also prove
their worth.

The film gradually builds in since
tional and dramatic tension throughout
the superbly paced finale of the story
While the climaa is not exactly uncxv
pectcd (it’s in the title) and imposes
somewhat ofa strain on the audience’s
suspension ofdisbelief, the film pulls it
offnnd makes it poweiful.

In the end, Whirl: Rider's slightly
overwrought storyline is forgivable-be
cause of its power to leave you with a
warm and uplifted feeling.
