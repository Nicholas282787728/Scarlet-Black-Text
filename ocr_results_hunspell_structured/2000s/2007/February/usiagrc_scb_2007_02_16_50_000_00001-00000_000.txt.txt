A1 Jones was not the most famous
historian to come out of Griiinell, but his
many students. r'rom rormer Grinnell College
Presrdent George Drake '54, History, to Sarah
Purcell '92, History, will remember his 1hlliry
to inspire. “Al was a questioner, a critic, a chal-
lenger, that was his style,” Drake said. “And
that was the “my he’d conduct his classes."

m Tarna, IA,
Jones began his
distrnguishcd ca-
recr at Grinnell as
a student. While

pursuing graduate snrdics at the University ol’

Michigan, the college contacted him to replace
history professor l-lomer Norton, who stopped
teaching after being proirioted to dean. Jones
was an American history specialist, biit the
ﬁrst two courses he taught in the fall of1954
were certainly outside his ﬁbld’lvledlevi‘l and
Roman history.

But Jones never had a problem
broadening his scholarship into other ﬁelds.
Friend and colleague Don Smith, History, tee
called: “My own ﬁeld is the history of Bil?
nin, but I could converse with him, he would
instruct me, tell me things that I didn't know
about the history ofBritain."

He passed his love orknorvledge on ro his
students. “He was very dynamic, he was very
exciting," Purcell said, “He was someone who
took ideas really seriously and he communicate
ed real passion for learning to his students."

Beloved prOfeSsor
passed away Sat.

During his 53-year tenure at the school,
Jones touched many lives, as evidenced by rhc
nearly 100 comments posted on the college’s
online forum “Al Jones Remembered” on
which members or the community can share
their memories orJoncs. Jason Vr/olf'95 will
remember Jones for his personable approach
to tenchrng: “I think the [lung 1 will always rte
memhcr about AlJoncs is that lie was the first
teacher I ever had who took a genuine Inter—
est in me as a person. Douglas 5 Russell 71,
who considered joncs a personal and llcidcinic
mentor, said I hope they have chalk boards

times, he cannot te. 1 without one.

Jones’s hie was not lrmrred
to the classroom. Passionate about
politics, he was an actrvt member or
the Democratic Party and served on
the Grinncll City Council. He CXT
pressed his commitment to the come
munity by \vl’itin" the commentary
for Pioneering, a photogr rhic history or the
college. According lo Smith, Jones was “a real
student of Iowa."

Always loyal to his alina mater ,Jnncs
constantly worked to better the Grinncll com-
rnuniry, devoting time and energy to research
and constructive criticism. “Up to last week,"
Drake said,“he was [emailing administrators]
about college issues and community issues and
[saying] ‘why aren't we doing this, why aren’t
we doing that.>w

Jones never lost that critrcal spirit,
“To be with Al was always stimulating,"Drake
recalled. “You could relax a little bit, but you
had to watch what you said, because he would
challenge it."

A student, thinker. and critic, Al
Jones epitomized the philosophy of the core
lege, Purcell said. “He's just sort oFrlic best of
Grinnell. really."

When Erin O'Neil ‘07, a Giiniielll’ians administrator, m,
ceivcd the message that Plans had been hacked, she knew it
meant stress and work for her But she did not know that the
work and stress would come not only from the hackers theme

' selves but also from the threats ofanothcr \tudent

GilnnellPlans was hacked last week by people usinrr an 11’
address in Croatia There is no evidence
that any sensitive information was court
promised, but Gir a brief period the ha
crs did have access to Plans user's' uscre
namcs. Passwords remained encrypted.

According to O'Neil, there are scv-
cn’ administrative accounts which have
broader access, including the ability to
reset. but not view, passwords. Thursday
night, one or the less-used accounts was
logged on, and other administrators got concerned. “That was
a big red ﬂ:i‘g,"s:iid O’Neil.

John Wellons '04, who has another administrator account,
looked back to scc what acrrons to person logged on had taken.
By hirer in the night, they were certain that the person logged

on was not the account owner. “We realized itwas an intruder,"

said O'Neil.

Before alerting the Plans community, administrators inves-
trgatod to set: if the hackers had changed any pron .mming or
installed any “h kdooi‘s" that would allow them acccss even
after the initial hacking. Once they were convinced that the
program was secure, they decidcd to switch Plans back to a
scrvcr in Hawaii to lock the hackers out.

At 3 a, m. Saturday morning, the switch uas made
with mlnimrll inconvenience to the Plans community in

After the transition, Lain posted a “Message or the

can be sure that the Croatian hackers didn't copy rhc r-
tubase for trying to get into people's email and financial
accounts."he has written on his plan.

concerned. “It was the oddest in e, be said Postman got
