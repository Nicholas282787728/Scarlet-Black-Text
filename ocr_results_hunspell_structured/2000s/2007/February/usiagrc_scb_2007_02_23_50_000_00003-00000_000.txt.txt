“Being the hands ostd" come?

It comes from the story of Esther,
and how she went to King Ahasuerus
to save her people, ...When she agreed
ro go, at her Unclc Mordechia’s urgingi
even at the risk of her life to present the cause
of her people, she said ‘I will use Gsd's left
hand and right hand in going; and the image
was that in going to do justice and to struggle

the values encrusted... 1n building a world of
justice our hands become the hands ofG-d."

When Brigittinc French,
Aiithiopology, ariivcd at
Griiincll College in 2003 for
her position as a posrdncroral
Mellon Fellow, she thought
her tenure at thc school
would not last more than two
years, As luck would have it,
a position opened up in the
department, French was hired
and she has been at Grinnell
ever since.

million matching grant

Newest grant from Mellon Foundation makes relation-
ship with College permanent, attracts post-docs

institutions to cnhancc thc
rcsearch opportunities they
can offer faculty and broadcn
the college‘s cun iculum.

When French was hired,
the Anthropology Deparr-
mcnr used rhe Fellowship ro
add a missing piccc co the
taculry. According to French.
the department “fclt a need to
bring in somccnc who spas
cializcd in language and culs
curc, which was missing from
the department. "

Mellon Fellowships aic
generally given to students
our ofgraduntc school. French
alluded to two beneﬁts of
becoming a fellow. “[17irsr],
there is a rcduced teaching
load for the fellow," she said.
“This reduced load, in turn,
allows the fellow to work on
their research and writing and
therefore be ablc to publish
onc's research.”

Administrators hopc the
grant will allow at lcasr one
postdoctoral fellow to come
to campus each year, with
hopes that it will eventu-
ally risc to two According

tions,“Wc can only rakc whar
the endowment gives us, and
this turns into possibly one
appointment in pctpctuity."
If the endowment allocates
extra money, then this will
allow the college to offer two
postdoctoral positionsr

According to French, the
Mellon Foundation hopes
“to introduce scholars to tlic
liberal arts collcgc crpcricncc,
and invite them to institutions
that they might not have been
introduced to." Administra-
tors hope that those grants
will dispel the misconception
that liberal arts schools do not
offer adcquarc rcscarch ops
porrunitics.

Grinnell College
has had a long relationship
with the Mellon Foundation,
receiving many of their tem-
porary grants, and rhis rcccnr

ing ivith Dee and she kept adding to the list
otsrurr ro change, wc wanted something very
specific that doesn't change," said Caner. “So
we got something ﬁnally in Writing."

The squad is currently collccring signarurcs
for a petition stating that the Athletic Depart»
ment is “prohibiting the cultural expression of
its students,” and that signers “are opposed to
covert forms of racism at Grinncll College."

“We were doing it right rhe whole time, we
were in communication the whole tim " said
Porter. “If it’s not inappropriate, why is it be»
ing prohibited?"

At one meeting With Porter, the Commitr
tee of coaches invited Jana Peebles, the advisor
of the Griniiell High School dance
team, to speak with the squad.
Peeblcs and the committee made
several suggesrions, including more
emphasis on (he pompoms, a kick
routine and a routine using basket-
balls.

"They’re making all these sug
gestions, anything but what we were doing,"
Porter said, “That is all well and good, that
form ofPom, but that‘s not what I’m used to.”

Porter believes that the Athletic Departs
mcnr’s concerns arc rooted in a bias against the
sounds style, “We’re supposcd to be grounded
in diversity, we’re supposcd (0 be grounded in
multiculturalism,” she said “And when wc
get here we can't express ourselves in rlic way
in which we’re familiar with from our backs
grounds."

Fairchild also has reservations about stir
dcrir and ran rcacrion to rhc squad. “The shin
dents havc bccn against having chccrlcaders
because they dun'i wanr to pur women on dis-
play,” she said. “When wc’vc had chccrlcadcrs
come in from other teams, the crowd has hccn
quirc unruly.”

POI'ICI docs not see these conceins as valid,
“It's like, do you understand that half ofus ill'C

FAC?" she said.

Fans at last Sarurday's basketball game
were receptive to rhe idea of a Pom squad. “I
think it would be great," said Patrick Lyons
’09. “It’d be great entertainment" He added,
however, that the fans in the front row of the
student section, who are often the most vocal,
usually leave the court during halftime.

Somc baskccball players were also accept-
ing of the possibility. cairlin Shannon ’07, a
captain of the women’s basketball team, ms
skeptical when she first heard about Pom
Squad.

“I was a little hesitant when I first saw
Pom squad,“ she said. “But there's a pocenrial

for Pom Squad to bc...a
great outlet to celebrate
multiculturalism at
Grinnell and diversity."

Fairchild said that
the squad has not been
in contact with the Ath-
letic Department about
performing this serncsrcr, She said she had ex,
pected that they would perform at two games
this scmrsrer, and was surprised when. rhey did
not contact her.

“If the athletic director hasn’t heard from
them, it’s hard to say that the athletic dll‘ccfol
is prohibiting rhem,"shc said.

Porter said rbc squad has nor coniacrcd
the Athletic Department because they are dis-
couraged by the ambiguity of demands. She
said the squad does not have time to develop
and receive approval {oi a whole new routine
before basketball season ends.

Filii'child said thc Athletic Department is
not scckiug to make rhc squad into soincrhing
they are not.

“We’ic not trying to change their style,"
she said. “I wanr rhcrn to be synchronized and
