Scorese’s best film in a
decade

Martin Scorsese has yet to win an
Oscar for beer director, despite having
directed such classics as Taxi Dii-i/N',
Raging Bull, and snow/as. This long
drought may come to an end soon,
however, as Tome/mired stands poised
to ﬁnally give Martin his statue.

The ﬁlm tells the storyofan under
cover police ofﬁcer who has infiltrated
the South Boston Irish mob, and a mobs
ster who has become a mole inside the
police department. The crime thriller,
which is Scorsese’s reinterpretation of
a Hong Kong action movie from 2002
called [mitts/Maria, is filled with ten-
sion as each oftlre inside men compete
to uncover the identity orthe other.

There is superb acting all around
with notable performances by Jack
Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo
DiCaprio and Mark VVahlberg, Nich-
olson is particularly despicable as mob
boss Frank Costello, and its nice to see
him play a deranged villain again af-
ter his recent Dianne Keaton/Adam
Sandier comedy stint. Leo gives a solid
performance as Billv Costigan, the tint
oercover cop, although for the most
part he is overshadowed by Damon and
VVahlberg, who play Bostonians in the
way only true natives can.

Clocking in at 151 minutes, the
movie could seem overly long to some,
but the tension kept me at the edge
of my seat and the time seemed to ﬂy
by. And while the final climax may be
overwrought and even forced, the film's
assets outshadow this ﬂaw. Scorsese
has deﬁnitely made his best film in a
decade, and this Italian New Yorker
could verywell finally win his long-de-
seriied Academy Award for a ﬁlm about
Boston Irishmen.

Lawrence of Arabia

*ttii‘r (1962)

Defying (same) gender
norms since 1962
Everything about Lawrence ofAra»

bia is epic.

It chls the epic tile ofTE LaWe
rencc (Peter O Toole) and his tempts
to unify the wrtious Arabian tribes to
drive out the Turks and establish their
own country in the midst ofWWI.

The titular Lawrence is epic in his
own right: a character almost straight
out of the Old Testament, a modern day
Moses who rescues souls in the desert,
brings together warring tribes and uses
his words and his faith to keep himself
ahead. Never mind that he's not the
most...rnanly of heroes Never mind
that he rims like my little sister. Never
mind that, were he just 1| little prettier,
the movie would be called Florence
of Arabia. He's actually a welcome
change otpace from the usual manly“l
cannot cry because my tear ducts are so
muscular" types.

The setting of the movie is epic.
Granted, it's not that difﬁcult to make
the vast oceans of desert in which the
majority of the film is sci impressive.
I’d wager I'd be able to do the same
with a disposable camera. Still, the
breathtaking vastness is something to
behold.

The rnovre is epic in run time, a
whopping three hours and thirtyssix
minutes (complete with intermission).
This makes the accomplishment ofnot
having a single female speaking role
in the entire ﬁlm all the more remark-
able,

When released in 1963,Lawtence of
Arabia garnered seven Oscar-s, includ»
ing Best Picture (although, strangely,
O’Toole was passed over, a recurring
phenomena ever since then) It tells
the tale of the remarkable Lawrence
against a remarkable backdrop with
some scenes that will literally leave you
speechless lfyou can handle the hefty
time commitment, I deﬁnitelyrecom-
mend it:

speak to my repressed inner child. or
maybe his pointed satire of such well-
regarded institutions like network news
and college fraternities stimulates my
intellect. But it s probablyjust the fact
that watching a slightly overweight
middle aged man run around in his ill—
ﬁtting underwear (something he seems
to do in all of his cinematic cndeamrs)
is extremely amusing.

And,yes, Ferrell loses his clothes in the

obvious glee on the part orthc movie's

infected with their contagious merri-
merit.

Ferrell is the obvious mention here, but

Gary core and the unexpectedly hilarie
ous John C. Reilly also merit attention.
The standsout performance, though,
belongs to Sacha Baron Cohen (you
might know him as Borat), who proves
he can bring the funny no matter what
over-the-top nationality he adopts.
Cerncnting its comedic value, Tal-
laorgo Nip/res is also endlessly quotable.
it may not shake up your worldview but
it will have you exclaiming Shake and
