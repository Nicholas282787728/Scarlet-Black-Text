Future Birthplace of Capt. Kirk

Each week the 5598 sends one Grinnellian to explore a Midwest oddity

I imagine that Gene Roddenberry didn’t
know what he was getting into when he crcr
ated Szm- Trek (The Original Series, for those
keeping track). certainly, he couldn't have
anticipated six television series (including a
cartoon), top videos and, well, this newspaper
aiticlc.

Riverside, Iowa, is a very small, unassum-
ing town just south oflowa City. Despite its
podunk atmosphere, it is, perhaps, the most
important place in the megnverse. Ir is the fu:

ture birthplnce ofcapruiniames Tiberius Itirk,
who commands Star Trek’s USS. Enterprise
A. During one Snu' TIM film, in the midst of
[line'l’lavﬁling on Earth to find 3 whale who
can communicate with a cienturc in the fur
turc, Kirk utters the immortal line, “I’m from
Iowa. Ionly work in ourcr space,” In 1985,the
Riverside City Council met and voted ununie
mously to dcclnrc their home Kirk’s (futurc)
hometown. I do not know what convinced this
group of elderly Iowa civic servnnrs to uriuni~
mously plrtce themselves it rhc epicenter of
Nerdsdom. It probably has something to do

with the precipitous decline ofsmztll from ugr
i-icultui-c .ind rhc ensuing desperate ruinl econ:
omics. Iiut ir nlso probably his to do with that,
(0 a bunch of 19805 fro-somethings, Captain
Kirk was a total stud.

Setting our on Stardatc 231756981 (last
Suturdﬂy),1 roped three of my nerd friends
into driving to Rivcrsidc wirli inc. It wasn't
hard to convince them.Thc Riverside council
members chose the right fan base to exploit for
tourist dollars 7 Star “Trekkies” think nothing
of ditching reasonable lives find driving hours
to glimpse n blatantly fabiicatetl piece of fur

rurc fiction. on rhc drive there, on highways
through cornfrclds, my friends and I first ar-
gued about stardatcs, rlien settled down to
muking jokes ubour warp drives and “nuclear
wessels."

The first artifact we sighted of the town’s
noble, fictional future was a model of the
U.S.S. Riverside .. a Constitution cliiss stare
ship, constructed on the buck of an old (mlk
er srnnding in a snowy park along the major
liigliwny through Riverside. This grant model
was a costrcffcctivc alternative the town chose
