On Wednesday. the Pioneers (1676, 1273
MWC) clinched at least a share of ﬁrst place
in the MWC with a solid defensive perfote
mancc by downing Knox College, 9144.

This followed on the heels of games in
which the Pioneers held St. Norbert College
to as points two weeks ago and held Lake For-
est College to 65 points on Saturday.

In that game against the Foresters, Grinnell
came out in typical fashion by grabbing a 7-0
lead off of three Lake Forest turnovers.

Both teams took turns going on scoring
runs during the ﬁrst half, but Grinnell never
lost its early lead and held a 53-30 lead at the
half.

The second half saw much of the same, as
Lake Forest was unable to get anything going
offensively while failing to stop the prolific
Grinnell offense. Foresters coach Chris Cone
ger was visibly frustratcd, earning a technical

foul with 13:10 left in the game, then getting‘

hit with a second a few minutes later to earn
an ejection.

“Sometimes when things are going bad, a
coach will get a technical to fire up his team,"
said Grinnell College Athletic Director Dee
Fairchild. “But it was too bad to see him lose
control."

As he left the court, Conger approached
the Grinnell College student section, talking
to the students and the security guards.

"Ijust wanted to let them know that] think
they are fantastic," said Conger of the student
section. “They are great for this league."

Conger declined to comment on the ejec-
tion or technical fouls, saying only that the
Pioneers played well and did everything to
deserve the win.

After the ejection, Grinnell’s lead swelled
to as much as 40 points, and the Pioneers
reached the century mark on a layrup by Joey
snyder '10 with less than a minutc to play. Jon

Grotberg ’09 led the team in scoring with 28
points on six of nine shooting from three-
point range.

”It was a good win for us," said Davc Arr

A strong Lake Forest team was cause for
concern for the Pioneer men leading up to the
meet. Senior captains Bud Baumgartner and
Adam Lorton agreed that Lake Forest junior
Michael Ojdana was a signiﬁcant threat to
steal some wins from Pioneer swimmers. 0,2
dana did win the zooryard freestyle, but Nate
Wittnam ’09 defeated him in the SOOryard
freestyle (4:45.05) and Paul Gagne ’10 beat
him in the 16507yard freestyle (16:51.42).

Witmam also took ﬁrst in the ZOO-yard
backstroke (2:00.65) and the ZOO—yard butter-
ﬂy (1:58.08). His victories topped offa season
that earned him male MWC Swimmer of the
Year recognition.

Gagne’s victory in the lose-yard freestyle
capped off a remarkable season that saw him
break his personalrecord despite having mono-
nucleosis. He overcame major interruptions to
his training schedule throughout the season to

edge out Ojrllina by less than a second.

The high level of peiformance of both
teams came as no suiprise to Hurley “We
knew we were going to swim fast," lsluilcy
SiIld. But the Pioneeis weie represented weLI
by more than the swimmers.

Grinnell’s divers scored crucial points for
the team. Garnet smith‘tib grabbed first place
ﬁnishes in both the one and three-meter dives,
earning the MWC Diver of the Year award.
on the women’s side, Andie schrage '03 took
home second in the one-meter,

The captains attributed the team titles to
deteiminatiou and work ethic. “We're a bunch
of scappers," Croco said. “We always give 100
percent no matter what."

They also agree that the training regimens
designed by coach Hurley enabled them to
perform at such a high lcvcl.

“We had some amazing time drops that
can be attributed to quality training and a
wcllrdcsigncd taper,"Baumgartner said, referr
ring to the carefullyrbalanced training phase
that occurs in the final few weeks before the
MWC title meet.

end of the road this season for all of the Pics

"They are tough cuts," Coach Hurley said,

“Vi/c hope with another week of test they can
do it."

After the Midwest Invitational, the Pioe

Baumgartner turns some credit back to his

many strong swimmers left."

System defense
worthy of praise

I have ﬁnally come to terms with an issue
that has plagued me for quite awhile.

You finally realized Mm you're a bug: jot
w/Ja writer [my many negaziw ﬂilit‘lcl 11ml do
[ill/e buz dtrrw the ire omemell ﬂIIJ/h‘ﬂ mid
Sam/'5 Rel! ailment?

Sadly, no. 1 figured that out along time
a o.
g My revelation instead involves the defense
that thc Grinnell men’s basketball team plays,
I've finally accepted that the frantic, pressing,
doubleeteameanything—that-moves style of
play is worthy of the name “defense."

It won’t easy to accept. I come from the
land of the Big Ten, whose defenses usu-
ally suck the life out of any potentially great
matchrup. No Big Ten team currently gives up
more than 67 points per game.

Because ofthis background, I have not ads
justed quickly to the pandemonium that takes
place every time a Grinnell opponent attempts
to inbound the ball. A wide open lay-up affects
me far more than it should, and I still shake
my head in disbeliefwhen 1 read quotes from
Coach Arsencault that state things like “We've
actually ﬁgured out that it‘s better for us to get
dunked in the first 10 seconds ofa possession
than it is for our opponent to hold the ball for
30 seconds without scoring."I understand the
reasoning behind it, but it's still bizarre.

The one constant that has emerged from
this defensive strategy is the opponent’s scorr
ing average, which has consistently hovered
around 110 points per game for the lost thrcc
seasons, including most of the current_ one.
This consistency means that Grinnell’s fate
usually rests in the hands of the offense.

Throughout Grinnell’s current winning
streak, though, I've seen the defense step up
and improve more than any other facet of their
play, meaning that the offense can have an off
day and Grinnell can stiu win. In the January
home games against Knox and Beloit. the Pior
neers shot 29.5 percent and 32.7 percent, re
spectively, from three-point range. Both were
below the season average, but Grinnell bcat
Knox by 20 points and Beloit by 19, holding
both teams under so points. Credit goes to the
defense here. Granted. this could be because of
the spread offense epidemic that has infected
numerous MWC coaches and slowed the pace,
but don't let that take away from a stellar den
fcnsive performance.

I have watched the defense become a far
more integral part of the team's success this
season than most Grinncllians would probably
have envisioned. sure, the system requirement
of 100 shots (with halfofthem coming from
beyond the arc) works pretty well, but so does
holding the other team to a somewhat rea
sonable amount of points on a bad Grinnell
shooting night. The Pioneers are contesting
more shots, forcing a significantly higher perr
centagc ofugly layups and ensuring that fewer
and fewer possessions end with an easy dunk,
The result? In the last ten games. Grinnell has
held its opponents to an average of 89 points
per game and has only given up 67.3 over its
last three.

Those performances are probably not repr
resentative ofperfect system ball as envisioned
by Coach Arsenault. But when the top four
teams in the MWC roll into Grinnell next
week for the MWC tournament, fans can
cheer on the Pioneers knowing that even if the
threes don‘t fall instantly, the Grinnell defense
(yes, defensel) might play a critical role in bail-
ing the offense out.
