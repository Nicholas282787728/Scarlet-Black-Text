Letters to the Editor new I

 

Remember the intifada’s violent side

In their letter to the editor last week, Giinnell’s Palestinian
Solidarity Group made the case that the Palestinian iirtiradas were
meant to “sh. ike off" the Israeli military presence in the lCﬁltO‘
ries known as the West Batik and Gaza Strip. The intifada" was
mostly non- -violent, and mainly about' inner dedication to their
community

This all sounds reasonable, and, indeed, justiﬁed, except tor one
thing: IT IS A LIE. The First Intifada (198771993) begun not
when Israel's army was engaging in its most brutal raids, but when
it indicated for the first time that it was willing to withdraw from
the West Bank and Guzaulhus making it look weak and vulner—
able to an Arab world in which militant Islamic revivalism was on
the ascent.

Further, that intifada and the more recent one (200072002)
were, most deﬁnitely, inherently violent. sure, a majority of the
participants and activities in these intifadas did not commit direct
physical harm to Israelis,but they had a violent spirit. Those “alien
native schools” that the group noted had been founded in the West
Bank and Gaza, let me give you a little taste of their curriculum,
and let you decide whether they could be called “non-violent."To

graduate from third grade in a Palestinian Authority school, little
boys and girls must dip their hands in a red liquid symbolizing
jewish blood, pump theii fists into the air and declare victory over
Israel, None of these schools have a map of the world that has a
state of Israel on it,

I would have thought that the Palestinian Solidarity Group
would have seen the logic that preaching violence and building a
political identity upon rejection of The Other were no different in
character than violence itself, especially given that the speaker who
they recently brought to campus, Ali Abunirnah, emphasized this
idea in his “criticism"oflsnel, but I guess consistency is not their
thing No, they would nither manipulate the English (and Arabic)
language to suit their political agenda and deceptively ingmtiate
themselves to Grinneliians through a raise image of pacifism and
moderation.

They even cleverly used the word “Israelis,” rather than Hews,"
to mask their anti-semitism when refering to the religious dispute
over the Temple Mount/Harm ash Sharifin Jerusalem, as ifno
one would realize thar Israelis are not a religious group. In short,
I hope Grinnellians are not swayed by this duplicitous attempt to

Stop intolerance, recognize Palestinian suffering

Editor 7 We were sorry to have read Alex Muller's letter,
“Palestinian Group Misleads," in last weeks 551?, While this
may not have been his intention, Muller’s letter came across as
something of an attack on Islam: full of subtle and not-so—sub—
tle hints connecting Islam with terrorism and basic intolerance.
And all because the Palestinian Solidarity Group chose for their
usemame that most inﬂammatory of words: “intifada. ”

Intifadas are purely reactionary; they are a “shaking off [of
oneself]," Early Palestinian intifadas have been relatively non-
violent and purely in reaction to Israeli occupation. We agree
that the PLO, under the late Yasser Amfat, and Arab leaders, in
their attempts to co-opt the Palestinian people’s piotest maths
ods for their own political ends, have done a lot to tarnish the
meaning and origins ofthe Palestinian Intifada.

Yet surely we are not to blame Islam itself for this? Muller's
equating oflslam with the lslnmism of Arab leaders is akin to
equating Catholicism with the militant activities of the IRA.
Enough of this! Muller picks rirgc . that me far [no easy (eg,
the Ayatollah), and it would be similarly convenicnr for us to
bring up say,Ariel Sharon.

On a book-to-book contest, we would recommend Avi Sh-
laim Shlitiin's T/Ic [ion Will, which mentions case after case of
peace attempts fiom Arib states that were rebuffed or incr with
silence by israel in the early years of then conﬂict. Israel’s first
priority, Shlaim — an Israeli historian — writes,was to develop
a powerful state and not to make peace with the Arabs. Shlaim
also reveals the desire for territorial expansion that was behind
Israel's decision to join forces with Fiance and Britain in their
1956 invasion otEgypt

We should also note that Israel is recognised by most Arab
countries. Israel has peace agreements with three countries: Pale
estine, Egypt and Jordan. The peace treaty with Egypt signed
in 1979 was preceded by Egyptian President Anwar al-sadat's

visit to Jerusalem in 1977. Israel also has diplomatic ties and
commercial offices in Oman, Qatar, Mauritania, Morocco, and
Tunisia, in addition to non-official relations With other Arab
countries. Israel refused an offer of normal working relations
with ALL Arab countries by Saudi Arabia,

It would not hurt to recall that historically, the Muslims
have been much better friends of theJews than say, the soscalled
Christians. Did Muslims expel Jews from their homes? Did
Muslims deport Jews to gasrchambcrs> Did historic antirseini-
tism come from the Muslims? The answer to all three questions
is a resounding no. Those Muslim leadeis and followers who
attach themselves to anti—Seinitism (imported from the West)
out of defensiveness (not unlike Zionist defensiveness) do so
foolishly. Everyone nceds to know whilt happened in Auschwirr,
and the many ways the Jewish people were mistreated, discrinlir
nated igiinst, oppresscd and tortured

Likcwisc with all other marginalised groups who rice similii
(ifto it less degiee of horioi) modes oi persecution 7 historie
cailv and piesenrly. As we remember the story ofthc Intel ct us
not forget the sufferings ofindigcnoiis and tiibal peoplc acioss
the globe Let us not {oi-get the stircless people, gypsics, Kurds,
the Rohmgayas and the Acelnlese. Let us i-cnicnibcr the horrors
faced by the Armenians in the Genocide of 1915, the-Crimbot
dians, the Chinese, etc.

The list is long, but necessary. This list includes the Pales-
tinians. For as long as either party refuses to acknowledge rhc
sufferings, past and present, ofthc other, there will not be peace
in the Mideast For as long as we split hails over words like

intifada, we will get nowhere. Again 7 enough ofthis e lets
move on.

sincerely,

SSC Blackman responds to paper’s criticism

In response to the articles concerning the omission of Wes
Beauty and Andres Chang's student initiative from the ballot in the
recent voting, I feel like I have been unfairly treated by the writ
ing staﬁ’ at the S558 and deserve a chance to defend myself It is
disturbing to me that this has even become an issue that, for what-
ever reason, has caused controvcisy. Because of, (at best) a lack of
research or (at worse) reporting biased by pcrsonal opinion, rite
decision that I made has been misrepresented and I will attempt to
explain what the 8558 decided to leave out.

First and foremost, it was within my jurisdiction to keep the
initiative off of the ballot. All of the articles criticizing me for my
decision cite the passage from the constitution, “All recommendas
tions are non-bindingunless absolutely necessary to ﬁt the proper
all into an actionable form."The previous articles have focused on
the “nonbinding” part, but failed to mention the siuiation where
the recommendations ARE binding,

The actual text of the initiative states, “students should more
adequately inform themselves to resolve these issues in a peaceful
and orderly manner."This is not actionable. What die authors sug-
gest is a personal and cognitive change for each and every student
at Grinnell. The very ﬁrst recommendation that I made—and
that I continued to make during my extensive ermail correspons
deuce with Andres and Wesmwas that the initiative had to be put
into an actionable form. The constitution (which Iwas accused of
not reading) made my recommendation binding and because the
authors did not make the necessary changes, it was well within my
authority to keep the initiative offthe ballot.

It is possible to disagree with my interpretation of the initiative
as not being actionable given the infomiation that was ieportetl
in the SUB, The truth of the matter is that it was always the
expressed intent of the initiative writers to educare the campus on
issues that they personally were concerned with and not for any
speciﬁc steps to be taken to do this.

In a correspondence that I had with one of the writers, he
claimed that their intention was to remind students of past events
and motivate them to become more self itical, Student init‘lcr
tives are not a mass communication device. They have a very spes
cific purpose and for good reason. If student initiatives become
a forum for any and all students to say what is bugging them, no
administrator, faculty member, or trustee would take them seri-
ously Enough damage has been done with joke initiatives in the
past and lwant to leave feature Student Services Coordinators and
students a stronger student initiative process.

I want to make it very clear that I do not think that Andres
and Wes's initiative is unworthy of being expressed to the campus.
Student initiatives are just not the place for educating the campus.
The irony of the situation is that, had the S88 actually published
the initiatives, or even portions ofthe text, Andres and Wes would
have achieved their goal of educating the campus. Eur instead the
reel; decided to atta k me based solely on my position in SGA
and suppressed the initiative to a greater degree thanI ever did, In
the words of the SUE staff themselves, “this action should not go
unnoticed.”

—Dvcw Blackman ‘05, Sludcrtl Service; Caprrl'z'm/or

manipulate the intellectual discourse on campus for political ends,
and I urge all Grinnelliuns to “shake off" the abhorrent ideas of
this group.

Before I finish, I must note that people have come to me after
reading my letter last week and voiced concern over its potentially
haretul and violent conrenr. one of these people was an Iraqi sni-
dcnt named Ahmed Ali, who, by the way, I found to be an excepe
tionaily brave man who risked his life during the recent war as a
translator for Western media scm'ces. He assured me that he does
not advocate Israels destruction and opposes militant Islam, and I
reassured him that I am in no way Islamophobic.

Rather, my arguments last week were meant to elucidate trends
in the Islamic world rather than to be used as a pretext for violence,
Regardless ofwhether a majority ofMuslims support radicalism
(I personally think that the statistics are unclear on this matter),
no Muslim is inherently evil, and a large minority, if not a silent
majority, oppose radicalism and seek to curb the power that it now
enjoys. Grinnell even hosted a leading Palestinian moderate last
semester, Dr. San Nusseiba, who spoke at a Rosenﬁeld sympor
sium.

SSC, SGA unfairly
attacked by paper

To the Editors

1 must express my extreme disgust at seeing a member of SGA

presented as a than on your editorial pages with zero real ext

lanati-on for their actions. such editorials as the one you penned
against ssc Blackman are simply uncalled for at the college level
and do not represent {air and balanced journalistic standardslt
was a biased attack job With pretenses of righteousness

I would not have bothered to write in to the SE51? if it were
not for the lnct that the writers/editors at the 3&8 do this suit of
thing on a yearly basis As both a senator and cabinet emcer (AC)
in SGA from 1998 to 2001 wiincsscd, and person any cypei ienccd,
sevenil instances wheie thc to B reported only one side ot SGA

and issued biased ediroiiils regmrd'mg ‘spccii‘ic son polir
c su hout h wing prciion nieicd the details oi those policies
The iiw e wis always thc s mic r ie student body was present-
ctl only th itrick and opinion oi students who were inﬂuential in
the publishing pi occss (plotiilnent activists who know the editors.
that is) before they were cicii iwiic orthu courioyeisy.

It should be noted tllatI know nothing about the current SGA
Cnl)lnc(.1 do not follow daily SGA activiticsl also, thanks to the
seas, know nothing of the tiers siii-ioiiiidiitg the controversy its
editorial board chose to pnntiticate ahoiit.The only thingI know
is that, without much reporting , and without any clear presen~
ration of competing arguments that the 8:38 editorial board
attacked an SGA officer. I only wish that I could see this ofﬁcer's
points, clearly prcscntcd,.. but, untoirunateiy, since I was not at the
latest SGA meeting (like so many students who have been turned
against SGA) I have no way offiiiding out what actually happened
at the latest meeting wirhin the pages ofthis newspaper.
