Perfect season slips away from men '5 tennis

BY LoLA GARCIA

On March 4, two tennis teams met in Burnsville,
Minn., to play for something much more important
than another win on a team record. The teams were
playing for perfection. During last Saturday's tennis
lneet, the undefeated Carleton College Knights and
the undefeated Grinnell Pioneers went head to head
with their perfect seasons on the line, knowing that
only one team could leave with its record intact.

It was the Knights who were left standing,
defeating the Pioneers s3, ending the tennis teams
perfect run and sending the men home with their ﬁrst
loss of the season.

Despite the loss, Head Coach Andy Hamilton ’85
was not disappointed in his team. “1 was really pleased
with how we played against Carleton," he said.

After pointing out Carleton’s regional tanking,
Hamilton predicted that Grinnell would probably be
making its way into the regional rankings, which are
coming out at the end ofMarch.

“For us to have a close 6-3 loss against a potential
NCAA qualifying team indicates that we have a
strong team this year," Hamilton said.

There were a few bright spots from Saturday’s
match. Dan LaFountaine '09, playing in the number
one position, defeated Carleton’s numberone,William
Holmes. Freshman Nate Fox and senior Kushal Shah
also defeated their singles opponents in the fifth and
sixth positions, respectively

Despite Saturday‘s loss, the Midwest Conference
named LaFountaine the Midwest Conference
performer of the week. When LaFountaine defeated
Holmes in Burnsville, his singles play record went to
a perfect seven and zero.

“I didnt have my best stuff but I found a way to
win, said LaFountaine.

The St Cloud, Minn. native is currently ranked
18th in the Central Region by the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association. LaFountaine and Fox are ranked
16th in the doubles rankings for the Central Region.

“l’m pleased that the Midwest Conference
recognized Dan’s fast start to his career and my sense
is his talent will be displayed beyond the conference
level and he will impact the region,"said Hamilton.

Hamilton credited LaFountaine’s “calm demeanor,
a strong work ethic and the ability to stay focused and
intense during his matches" with his success so far this
season.

The men‘s tennis team hopes to improve their
record over the next three weeks. This weekend
the Pioneers will be playing both St. Ambrose and
conference riwl Carroll College at home on the old
