Memories built on the sideline

SARA STAYER

av DAVID MONTGOMERV

sarah Slayer ‘06 made her
mark in Grinnell's swimming
pools right away. A diver, she
made Nationals as a firstryear.
then again as a sophomore and
junior. Bur while experimenting
with pole vaulting after her third
rrip re Nationals, Stayer badly ins
jured her knee, rearing her ACL,
bath menisci, and a “good chunk"
of her arterial carrilagHFfet
tively ending her senior year sea-
son before it began.

After microscopic surgery to
reeonstruet the knee with a putof
her patellar tendon, Stayerwasn't
able to put any weight on the leg
for six weeks. It didn't fully heal
for a year. but Slayer stayed with
[he ream, and said rhat some of
her best experiences at Grinnell
came while injured.

“Nationals was fun and every-
thing, bur by far was not my most
memorable rime here," stayer
said. “The most memorable
times are when you’re screaming
on the sidelines with your ream—
mates. The supporr that [rhe d'
ing] team has, the closeness—it's
just incredible." Stayer was voted
“most inspirational” by her ream-
inares rhe last rwo years.

Stayer might continue to
inspire divers after graduate
ing from Grinnell—or take a
deeper plunge to the bottom of
the world. She's currently on the
waiting list for several paid po
sitions at McMurdo Station in
Antarctica, where she could do
anything from helping scientists
with data eollection to packaging
hazardous waste. This appeals to
Staycr, a Biology major.

“You're atabiologieal research
searion, which for me is totally
excirlng," Stayer said, “While I
mighr not be doing research, I
still get to talk wirh scientists,
go ro lectures. Who knows what
kind or cenraers you make our of
that?"

Sraycr is the alternate for four
different positions. and could
hear any day between now and
October if a spot opens up. if
nothing materializes, she’ll work
as n eoach for the diving ream at
rhe University of the South, See
wanee for a year.

In the longer term, medieal
school is a possibiliry. Stayer has

going (0 be in contact forever."
Dimitr is working in Iowa City
arrer graduating and hopes to ger
a PhD. in Psychology.

There is at least on post-

droarns of doing publie health
work in impoverished rhird-
world eountries. “After I gradus
ate, I would like to do a lot of
work inrernationally for a while,"
Slayer said, “I like rhe idea of
helping a lot of people, maybe
setting up clinics in places like
Africa or South Americas"
Regardless or which path

Stayer chooses, one major dif-
ference from her life at GrinncU
will be whom she lives with. She's
Lived with Nlegan Dlmitt Y06 for
all four years since they were
placed together in a quad.

"She's kind of been my a
char at Grinnell," Srayer said. I
can't imagine nor calling her cw
ery week at leasr. We're deﬁnitely

graduation aceomplishinent
that Stayer hasn't lined up. She
laughed when asked about pose
slble marriage plans. ”I don't even
have a boyfriend," she said.
