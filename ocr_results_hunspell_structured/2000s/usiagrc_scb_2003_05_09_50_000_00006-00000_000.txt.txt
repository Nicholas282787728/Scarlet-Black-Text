Teach an Elmo class!

Do you enjoy...
Wine-tasting? Fingerpainting?
Watching cartoons? Discussing the
Cold War? Speaking Swahili?
Playing Professor?

Here’s your opportunity to show off your skills, be a resource to the community, and
do what you enjoy, all at the same time! Teach an ExCo class next semester: you
decide what to teach, how many people to teach, when to teach, and most
importantly, how to teach. We'll take care of your operating expenses so that you
can focus your time and energy on sharing a skill with the community.
