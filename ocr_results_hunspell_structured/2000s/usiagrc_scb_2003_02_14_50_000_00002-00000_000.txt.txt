that it will close at the end of February after more than 30 years
in almost Continuous business. Last year, upon hearing that the
theater might close due to sagging'proﬁts, a group of local

has already been extended once, expires in mideMarch . . . Last
week, college environmental coordinatorgBRIAN TURNER '02 was
