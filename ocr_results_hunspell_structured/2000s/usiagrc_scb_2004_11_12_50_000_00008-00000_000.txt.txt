Cutting hair
on campus

Kat Henry '05 prefers her desk scissors to
professional styling shears, but she has still
given about 40 successful haircus from her
improvised salon in the bathroom of Dibble
3rd. kat started cutting hair last year when a
friend randomly asked if she could give him a
trim. Indeed, she could, and she found that she
actually enjoyed cutting hair.

At first, Henry just tut hair for a few close
friends but when Word got out that "Kat
cuts hair,” she began charging 35 per Cut.
Undaunted by her complete lack of professional
training, Henry can do “layers, mohawks, 'xie
cuts” and of course just the basic trim. Quick,
cheap and easy, cuts by Henry have built quite
the reputation on campus.

Anatomy ofa 14- minute
and 30 second haircut

5:06 P.M. Tlari Moscovitz '07 decides to
obtain a pimpin' new hairstyle. With little
money and not much to lose, we not to take a
n‘sk on a back alley haircut.

5:07 P.M. Arrive at cleverly harried "Kat's
Kuttery," Kat Henrys haircutting salon located
in the women's restroom on Dibble 3rd. Pay
Henry 55, which I assume she uses to buy
drugs.

5:07:30 PaM. Henry "moderately dampens”
the wchm's liaii.

5:11 P.M. Henry wraps Mostovitz’s shoulders
in a fuzzy yellow towel and cheerfully asks
him how much he wants cut. Moscovitz
gingerly suggests maybe a halt an inch. Henry
says, "That’s all?!” and picks up herstandard
pair of desk scissors.

5:11:25 P.M.Sriippiriq begins. Henry
always begins at the back of the head, making
it "look natural" betore moving around to the
sides. Her snipping style strikes me as a rather
random series or hacks and cuts. ”It‘s very
haphazard," she says, “but it works that way,"
she then sagely added, ”It's kind of my style
to life."

5:13 P.M. Henry ﬁnishes the back and starts
snipping along the right side.

5:15 P.M. Moscow'tz/s once-wild forehead
fringe is swiftly severed. ”I'm kind or an
impulsive person,” says Henry, ”! just go for
it.” Moscovitz looks a little disconterted.

5:17 PM. Henry and Muscovitztakea
moment to evaluate the progress. Henry tests
the style by pooiiug out Moscovitzs wet hair
and sgurshing it back down again. They decide
that ”it’s looking disproportionate" and decide
to "take a little more off the sides.”

5:19 PM. The back of Moscovitz’s hair is
looking "solid," While she’s trimming around
the top, I ask Katifshe has ever had any
major mishaps. "One time i took a chunk off,"
she says, "but it was for a friend and she was
pretty understanding."

5:20 P.M. Moston‘tzs head is looking more
proportionate. He mentions that he likes Hats
spontaneous style. “Thats right,” kat replies.
”I can't have the man telling me how to do
it."

5:21 P.M. Kat does some finishing snips off
the back and has Moscovitz stand up so she
can cut the last few errant hairs. Mostovitz's
ﬁnal hair is an inch shorter.

5:21:30 P.M. Moscovitz checks himselfuut
in the mirror and describes his hair as ”super
ily ,. by which l mean iive stars." Then we
leave.

Marv lieding, owner ofthe Towa Barber Shop, grew up on an Towa farm with three brothers and
always wanted to be a small town barber. So he went to barber school for 11 months, and he
has been cutting hair in Gn'nnell ever since 1975. When asked to reminisce, Marv can recall
the days of guys coming in to get their long ponytails lopped off. further dredging up history,
he commented about the red and blue striped barber pole that hangs outside his shop. ”Vears
ago, they used to do blood-letting and tooth-pulling. lt revolves and has a light in it, but our
wiring got pinched by Brown's Slice Store next door." Today, many Grinnell basketball players
go to this 5th Avenue establishment, along with others who come ror Marv’s famous "tapered”
haircut. Marv prides himself on being a family barber and is excited to be expen‘encing the
joy of providing ”second generation haircuts" with his rnost loyal and fernle customers. His
straightforward technique for cutting children's hair—“Vou just gotta watch that you don’t

Linda Tuttle and Marcia white have 70 years of expenehte between them and
now have a two chair beauty salon in what was once a three-car garage. By
far the most tonvenient place to get a piofessiorial hair cut, Marcia’s Trim-u
faces the back or Grinnell House and otters haircuts for only $15.90. The plate
is small, but cozy ifyou are comfortable around older women, spritz bottles
and swivel chairs. Marcia has ”always liked cutting and perms.” it may be
dirhcult to get an appointment, because the Tn'm-u doesn't have a "turn-over
clientele.” Both women seem to like college students, however, and it's worth
calling ahead in order to obtain a place on the schedule. When asked about
the zaniest ieguests from college students, Hartia explained that she thinks
"students who want wild haircuts tend to do each other’s, and they might
come here to get it straightened up.” The motto of Marcus is "Pleasing you,
pleases me,” and this small salon just might give you the haircut you need,
just a few steps from campus.

A visit to Headquarters revealed a homey place to get a haircut. A man’s

cut costs $12 and a woman can have her hair shampooed, cut and blown

dry for 522, However, no price is too great to receive a hair cut from the
very same man who trims the regal hair of Russell K. Osgood. Both Matt and
Sally, the ownet accept walk-ins. Even if you don’t need a haircut, you might
drop in just to see the authentic barber chair circa 1933 that sits behind
Matt's booth. Also displayed on Matt’s side of the room is a Sign that reads,
”Business hours subject to change during hunting season.” Matt hunts, and
this Thanksgiving he will be eating a turkey he killed last spring. When asked
if people ever seemed disappointed with their haircuts, Matt replied, ”I make
sure to talk to them enough to ﬁnd out what they want so they don’t get
surprises .. Women especially don’t like surprises." Matt begins a hairtut
with the clippers, then shears and then blends the different lengths of hair.
He doesn't do prom hair, so before you think or requesting a dramatic up—do
fit for waltz, remember that Matt declines this endeavor stating, ”100 much
time, too little money.” in summary, Headquarters is less fussy and more
straightforward than the salons geared to older people in town. when one
walks in, they aren't confronted with five older ladies sitting under the dryers.
Instead, there might be a dog and a family waiting for hairtuts.
