A til 11, 1975—During spring vacation,~majds checked

Numerous items were found missing, articularly chairs.

South campus recorded fewer items gone.

If you puke, you clean it up

Living on the lst ﬂoor of a dorm has its share
of advantages and disadvantages, the biggest pro
probably being the lack of stairs and the biggest
can probably being the case with which ran om
drunk people appear on your ﬂoor on a weekend
night. Such seems to have been the case this past
Saturday night when a large and mtl'lcl' misty pile
orvomh decided to suddenly appear on the ﬂoor
ofaJames lst bathroom overnight. Some quick
advice to the offender and others like you. One,
know your limits, don‘t have those last two un—
needed shots. Two, if you’vo reached the point
of no return, aim better. Tlu‘cc, if you fail at the
first two, actually clean up the mess you've CFC-
nrcd, preferably shortly after you created it. It’s
basic sclfsgovcrll'ancc, people

Please go dishless, not trayless

If I had to tell you what annoys me most as a
dishlinc workenl could do it in two words: ”trayless
dining."Thc dislllinc is a trough with running wa-
ter on the bottom and rollers on top. The tellers are
designed {oi (rays. Big plates usually Stay up, while
anything smaller falls promptly- into the trouﬁ and
is swept down the line toward a recycling compac-
tor. Then we, the workers, get to go resale dirty
dishes out ot’dirty Water, while more work piles up
behind us.

Thcl'c is an easy solution: “plateless dining." 1:
takes no more water to clean a tray than it does to
clean a plate, cvcn discounting the tears ot’t’ms—
tration l shed when l have to stop the line, again,
because thrcc jerks in a row thought trays were for
other people.
