The Minnesota Vikings, StarCaps, and Cheeseburgers

As a tan ofthe Minnesota Vlkmgs,l have seen some strange
final weeks of the NFL season and this year iwilh the ongur
ing turmoil of Kevin and Pat Will'ilims'7isn’t going to be any
exception, I've watched them lose to an 0—12 Lions team, start
Spcrgon Wynn at quarterback, get knocked out of the playoffs
by a last second touchdown pass from the illustrious combina-
tion ofJosh McCown and Nate Poole and seen Randy Moss
walk to the locker room in defeat before the final whistle had
hlown. sure, there was only one second left and it was impos-
sible to win, but sports pundits talked about it non-stop, so 'it
must have been a big deal.

With all of these ugly momentsiand believe me when I
tell you that Spergon Wynn at quarterback reaches Sam Cassell
levels of uglinessi it was inevitable that this Vikings season
couldn’t end with your runrofrthermill first round playoffloss.
No, they couldn’t set a date and time for the end ofthe Vikings
season; they had to drag it on and on like the find two minutes
ofa basketball game, even when the home team is up by twelve

mm.
P For those that don't know, the NFL gave the Williams wall
a fonr game suspension for taking Starcaps which contained
humetanide, a diuretic that can be used to mask stemids. The
Williams’wcre sneeessfnl in ﬁling an injunction in a Minnesota
court that allowed them to play against the Lions last week.
Their argument was fairly simple. The NFL found ont in 2006

that StaiCaps contained this illegal substance, although itwasn‘t
on the label, and failed to tell the NFL Players Association. In
response, the NFL has argued that a player is responsible tor
what they put into their body, no matter what misinformation
they receive from the league.

Now, l'm no expert on the steroid usage hahits ofNFL plays
ers, but i am fairly certain that 95 percent of them are taking
performance enhancers in some form. The thing is, the NFL
doesn't test for many of these drugs, and I assume they are fairly
easily obtainedrl mean, if lose Canseeo can simultaneously buy
steroids while letting a ball bounce oft" his head for a homerun,

 

they can’t be all that hard to get.

So if they really were taking StarCaps to mask steroids then
the Williamses, Deuce McAllister, Charles Grant, and Will
Smith are dumber than Carl Everett. There’s no real way of
knowing when, or how this is going to end, but I have my own
suspicions along with a few predictions for the rest of the foot—

ball season.

The Dolphins will somehow manage to make it into the
playoffs relying heavily on their innovative wildcat tormae
tioiir That scheme will inevitably be their downfall, however,
as Rieky Williams will become paranoid that there is actually
a large ferocious cat in their backﬁeld causing him to fumble
twice in the Divisional Playoffs.

in theirweek17 game at Lambeau, the Lions will pm forth
a Herculean effort that will see them avoid becoming the ﬁrst
team ever to lose all sixteen games in a season. Unfortunately
for Detroit fans, they don’t actuallywin the game as in overtime
Daunte Culpepper is too slow to get under center to snap the
ball with first and goal from the inch line before time expires.
Like another member of the Draft Class of1999, cnlpepper
didnt realize that a game can end in a tie and they finish the
season 0 15- 1.

As for the saga of the Williams Wall, Minnesota will make
a surprise run to the Super Bowl only to have the injunction
lifted the day before the game, starting their four game suspen-
sions. Chris Johnson will proceed to rnn for 200 yards and
LenDale White will sit on the sidelines eating cheeseburgers
until he‘s called on to punch it in from the one Roger Good-
ell will smile with glee as he hands the Tennessee Titans the
LombardiTrophy
