Sadly, tlicWinter Olympic Games have come to a close.
Team USA won rhe rncdal countiyay! other conniries
did well too—ﬁlmy! Go World! But while many Americdn
students weie holed up in our houses and lounges, sup
porting Johnny Weir or Lindse1 vonn o1 Shaun White,
we have to remembei that the Grinnell College student
body is 13 peieenr international students, and the Olyan
pics aren't all abourTciin USA raking liome the gold.

For Ria Laureiis ‘10, who was born in Nova Scotla,
Canada, getting excited about the Winter Olympics has
to do with a lot of eaily exposure to the sports that are
played at the games.

‘ I went home for a weekend and my
paients were Sitting in front of rho TV
watching a women's gold medal curling
match, like analyzing technique and
using all this jargon because, 1 mean,
they went to couples curling every day
when they were first married, Laue
reijs said. “My mom was the caprain
or her curling squad, so ir's just what
you’re exposed to. Everybody watched
ﬁgure skating and everybody played

hockey—l spent more time at the rink Shun’i Ukai ’13

watching the boys play hockey than
was probably healthy

Naturally, for Laureijs and other Canadians, the derear
of the USA inen’s hockey rearn 1v.1s rhe highlight of the
Winter Games.

“It was huge. It was huge and it was I think it‘s one
of those things that I don’t think Ameiicans quit: realize
how important it is," Lailreijs said. “lfwe lost rhe gold
medalilike yeah, we didn't win the medal countibut if
we had lost rhe gold medal in men's hockey, or women's
hockey but men's hockey speciﬁcally, it would have been
just devastating"

sure, the Canada—America hockey rivalry may be ar
the forefront of many Olympiventhusiasts’ minds1 but
what other countries hold grudge matches?

Shunji Ukai ’11 ofJapan tires the Japanese rivalry with
Korea on the ice as a major source of lympics debate.

"I read Japanese newspapers every day and ﬁgure skat-
ing is a big deal,"Ukai said. "They talk about Korea versus
Japan, how it’s the biggest rivalry, how we have to beat
and will beat Korea."

Even beyond this Winter Games rivalry, Ukai spoke

”/ read the japanese newspapers
every day and ﬁgure skating r5 a big
deal The}! ta/k about Korea versus
Japan, now It’s a big rivalry, now we
have to beat and WIN beat Korea.”

about his country's strength in the Summer Games as
well, and Japan’s pride in hosting typical powerhouses like
the Us,

“In summer, soccer is big, Anti softball and baseball
too," Ukai said, The Japanese teams are it llv good at
baseball 11nd softball, we've won and beat Amen in teams
for a while now. The Japanese are li -, ‘Tliey made up due
goddamn sport so let's bent rhem ar'

Some students, however, don't have such stiong ribs to
the importance orthe games

“1 iust tlont care, stud Swayam Bagariu 1-3, :1 student
from Calcutta, lndia “\Vc dont have any athletes really
competing so ljust dont watch the Winter Olympics."

Though Bagaria doesn't actively
watch the Winter or Summer Olym~
pics, he did point to a proud moment
111 Indian Olympic historic

“We did have a shooter win the gold
a while ago," Bagaria said. He's speak-
ing of Abltinnv Bindra, who made his
Olympic debut at the Sydney Games
in 2000, was the youngest shooter to
ever he at rhe Olympics and won 111*
dials ﬁrst gold.

“He's :1 liero because he won the
ﬁrst gold medal for India at the Olym-
pics, so he's basically a celebrity,”
Bagaria said. In terms of this year’s Winter Games, how
ever, Bagatia said, “But yeah, look at the medal raceilns
dia has zero."

But medal races aside, rhe Olympics is abour bring
ing countries together to support each other. with many
tragedies surround the games,both personal and national,
Laureijs commented on one Canadian skater’s personal
tragedy—Joannie Rochette.

“She won bronze in ﬁgure skating a week after her
mother died, It was amazing, and so beautifulml was cry»
ing watching her skate," Laureijs said. “The nice thing
about Jeannie is that she‘s an example of how the Olyme
pics can bring people of different nationalities together.
too. I think she had an outpouring of support from a ton
ofpeople, which is a pretty amazing thing in such a come
petitive tournament. l‘tl‘iink she’s going to be remembered
for a long. long time, and rightfully so."
