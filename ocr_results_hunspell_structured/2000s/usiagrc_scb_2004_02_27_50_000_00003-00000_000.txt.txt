Laura Ki-ifrowitz is shown plugging hereais
to drown out “sound bombs" while other
members of the international Solidarity

bulldozers and a Palestinian home as hue

before he died.

Kraﬁowiﬂ. who returned to eampiolast
weekend to speak about her experiences in
Israel and Palestine, was a member of the
Grinnell class of 2004 for two years. Then
her money ran out and tuition kept rising.
After dropping out, she found herself hope
ping from plooe to plate, sometimes work
ing and sometimes not. not decision to
travel to Israel was somewhat haphmrd.
Kraftownz is on American low and was
raised in a Jewish household. In her com-
munity, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict al-
ways loomed as an unspoken question, it
was difﬁcult for
Kraftowiu to reallyhnd
out the truth in the
US. because there is so
mueh eontradietory in-
formation. She believed
she needed to travel to
Israel to find the reality
of the situation and
“season for my roots in
the oonﬂiet."

When Kraftowitz
found out about an organization ealled
hirthright Israel after almost a year ofdrift.
ing it seemed like the rightdeeision to take
advantage of the program they were offer.
ing. Bitthright ismel sponsors a ten-day tour
of ismei for young diasporie Jews. Then it
offers opportunities for them to stay in the
eountry as long as they like. Athird oftheir
funding eomes from die Israeli government
and the rest comes from donors across the
globe The program is entirely free ofehatge
fat the traveler, which, antowm said. was
the main reason she chqsc it.

Kraftowirr stayed and worked in Israel
for three months. She ended up working
with a string of volunteer organrvations,
many religious. Sometimes she worked for
groups devoted to promoting peaoe be-
tween Israel and Palestinet She worked in a
center foreultural exchange between Palesa
tinians and Israelis, but said that “mostly
lews don't go there by choice." Also. she
often found herself working with victims
of suicide bombers, which she calls “hu»
man bombs."

During her time in lsreel. Kraftowite
said, “I deﬁnitely swerveda bit [D the right,"
despite her tonstantseareh fer "perspettive"
and “the middle of the road." She made
friends among the israelis. many ofwhom
were soldiers. They would tell Kraftowitz
stories about what would happen on the
frontlines, and aboutwhat Palestinians were
doing to d1eir oountry, and she was inelined
to believe them. “It’s counter-intuitive to

needed to be, and on

But Kmftowitz also had o friend in
Rafah, an isolated erty in the southern West
Bank, and she became suspieious when ihe

quaintenses and the media didn‘t mateh up
with what she would hear from her friend

Kraftoivitr said she went back to Israel to
“retssess what I’d been doing with my life,"
butsoon after an ISM peace activist, Rachel
Corrie. was crushed by a bulldozer while
trying to defend a Palestinian home.
Kroftowitz went back to Rafah to stay.
