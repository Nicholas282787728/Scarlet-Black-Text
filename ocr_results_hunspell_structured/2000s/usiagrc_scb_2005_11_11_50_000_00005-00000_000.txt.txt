The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (PG)

There’s a reason girls go to the bathroom in packs.
There’s a reason “chick ﬂicks," often called “guilty
pleasures," accompanied by junk food on a “girls’
night," are so popular. Female friendship is a reality
that often falls prey to Hollywood’s saccharine for-
mulas. But TIM Sheer/mod i/[bd Tint/cling Panel“ story
of four friends is simply sweet.

Sixlel'l'aad, based on the popular young adult
book, is about four teenage. girls who discover a pair
of“magical"jcans that fits each girl perfectly, despite
their different body types, As the inseparable friends
spend theirlasr night together before a summer apart,
they agree to share the pants, shipping them across
the globe and wearing them on their adventures, in—
cluding particularly enjoyable scenes filmed in Greece
and Mexico.

Each actress holds her own. We see how different

shy Lena (Alexis Blcdc) is from sassy Carmen (Amen
ica Fererra), or wisecracking Tibby (Ambchamblyn)
from athletic Bridget (Blake Lively). But they are
not caricatures; we get a sense of the backgrounds
and interests that mukcs their characters bclicnblc,
They are mature, unselﬁsh and kind to each other: a
refreshing change from the backstabbing women we
usually see on screen.

America Ferrcra, the strongest performer, delivers

.3 poignant speech to her new stepmother. In another

climactic scene, you feel like a passerby who shouldn't
be privy to such a private moment. It would be easy
for the monC to take a sentimental turn, but director
Kcn Kapwis and writer Delia Ephron (ochgtRyant
chickrflick hall of fame) tug at just the right heart-
strings, and we end up rooting for the girls.

Sara nd (R)

swede Ingmar Bergman easily falls among the
greatest directors offilni history, having made powers
ful and intelligent films throughout the course of his
career. so when Bergman “came out ofretirement" to
film Saraband, his self-declared final ﬁlm, I was ec-
static. Finally, I had a chance to see a new ﬁlm from
one of my favorite filmmakers.

Saral'and follows an earlier Bergman ﬁlm, Swim
[mm a Marriage, though no knowledge of the prior
film is necessary to understand the plot or the char
acters; the relationship that formed the centerpiece of
stems/ram a Marriage plays only a small role in sitter
land. Instead, 'the story centers on the relationships
between Johan, an aging millionare, his son Henrik
and his granddaughter Karin.

As in many other Bergman films, these central
relationships are strained, marked as much by hatred
as by love. Only a love of Henrik’s dead wife ties the
characters together, and her portrait becomes a recur»
ring image in the film. Meanwhile, Marianne, Johan’s
ethife, becomes an outside observer; she actually ads
dresses the camera directly in two soliloquies at the

outset of the ﬁlm, very theatrically binding her to the
audience.

Bergman’s films typically excel in every aspect, and
Sari/[band is no exception. Though Mariaiines initial
conversation with the camera is unsettling, powerful
acting and an excellent cast quickly pulls the audience
into the film. Bergman’s writing lends both a very hu-
man quality to the characters while elevating their
stniggle above the typical melodrama that its plot
might suggest. Missing, unfortunately, is long-time
Bergman cinematographer Sven Nykvist, but the sub-
stitutes did their best to imitate his brilliantly natural
style of lighting and did not fail to create several subs
tly striking images, whether they are human portraits,
interiors of churches or stunning landscapes.

With this film, Bergman has met all of my cit
pcctations. Samband certainly rates as one of the best
new films that I have seen this year, if not the best.
And as for those pesky foreign languages, if it was
good enough for the Swedish chef, it's good enough
for me.

The Constant Gardener (R)

Many lilms about Africa are enchanting and pow
crful, for example the 2001 German film Number: in
Afl'it/I.Yet like many of its predecessors, Tim Commie
Gar-diner is ﬂawed in spite of some admirable qualit
tics by hyperbole and specious portrayals oflife in the
Continent

Ralph Ficnnes portrays Justin qiayle, a charm
ing and mild-mannered (rend: somewhat pallid) reps
rcsentativc ot the British government working with
AIDS in Kenya. Tessa (Rachel Weisz) encounters
Justin for the first time at a press report while he is
in Europe and apparently courts him by ruining his
reputation. After convincing him to take her to Africa
with him, she spends much ofthe film complaining.
The film seeks to elucidate and expose the malicious
intentions of powerful pharmaceutical compauics in
Africa. Yet, rather than criticizing those who run said
companies, the film emphasizes lowertlevel incidents
of corruption among native African nurses, doctors
and politicians. Such a portrayal is inaccurate at best
and racist at worst.

Tessa is “mysteriously" murdered during an out
ing with her friend, a doctor named Arnold Bluhm
(Hubert Koundé). While Arnold is blamed with the
impetus ofbcing an invidious lover, we all know the
pharmaceutical companies are responsible, as they are
upset at Tessa’s investigation of their policies in Al'-
rica. It’s not that the film msn’t persuasive in arguing
that rampant corruption exists in Africa, but weren't
we all already aware of that? The film painfully den
generates into a conspiracy theory, with practically ev-
ery character in the film out to get poorJustin Qiaylei
sure, perhaps the pharmaceutical companies could
exert some pressure with local Kenyan authorities,
but airport personnel throughout the world, beggars
in London and isolated mercenary gangs in remote
Kenyan regions as well? I expected more from For
nando Meirelles, who is responsible for City afGa/l,
among other great films. TIM Commit Gardner utterly
lacks the cinematography, distinct personalities and
accurate and poignant portrayals of locale that made
City cycada masterpiece.
