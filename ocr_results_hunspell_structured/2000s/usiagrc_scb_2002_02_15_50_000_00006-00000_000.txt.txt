the Grinnell bubble and lived to tell about it

by Sara Millhouse
Staff Writer

One might think that Ellen Gallagher '04 would have sorrre nega—
tive feelings about the semester the spent volurrtccring and traveling
in Guatemala. After all, her wallet, ash, and credit (‘41de were stolen,
Some of her friends heard rumors that the was dead. Later in her
stay, a ﬁrecracker :xplodedso close to her ear that she still sometimes
hears ringing. Yet when asked is she made the right choice to take
time off from Grinnell, :1 huge smile spread across her face, “Yeah,"
thetaid. “Hell yeah."

Gallagher is one ofrnany students who have
deferred college admission for a year or taken
time 0K from their college education. While
manysmdcnts had similarly positivc ckpcricnces
during their time away, their activities varied
from hitting the rampaign mil to practicing
transcendental meditation to learning the bar
sics ofwilderncss survival and took them from
central America to Europe to New zealand.

Gallagher took offthe last semester. the ﬁrst
half of her sophomore year. While in Guate
mala. Gallaghcrvolunrcercdon an organic mac
adamia nut farm for a month. “I lived in a trailer.
no electricity, no shower," she said, “It was fun
though. It’s a rcally grmt country."

Gallagher spent much ofd1e rest of her stay traveling through
Guatemala. Sh: spent time in Xela and at Lago Atirlan, : ci-arcr lake
surrounded by volunoes, as well as tovclrng north into Mexico to
Trkal. She hiked, learncd about regional history, spent rim with Io-
mls and other foreigners, and enrolled in Escuela dc la Montana, a
school whcrc studeno attended Spanish classes during the day and
are with families working on a nearby cofrcc farm. “My favorite plate
was Todos Santos," shc said. “It was the first place I really got to
know." She described this cold mountain village and the ubig, crazy.
drunken horse mean" afthe Dl’o dc los Santos festival with unbridled
enthusiasm.

Family values

After spending a semester in Costa Rita, Becca zwerling ’02 felt
she needed time away from the traditional college atmosphere to
apply sor'ne of the rmlues shc lcarned during her semester abroad.
“My hosts had a tremendous sensc of family i realircd that l could
work on these relationships even more. l also learned to live life at a
more rcasonable pace," the said.

zwcrling decided to spend the first Semester other senior year
living with her family in Glastonbury, Conn. She took classes or nvo
nearby colleges, University ofConnctticut and st, Joseph's Colltgc.
She also worked part-time and volunteered During htr timc away,
members ofher extended family berarne ill, confirming thc rmpor.
tance of‘laeing them" with family members during times of need. “it
w a difficult decision. Taking time olfdrrrirrg my senior year didn't
make logistiml sense, but it's made all the difference in the way I livc
my life," said Zwerling.

Cultural encounters

While some students traveled home to strengthen close relation-
ship. others felt they needed to expand their horizons. “thn i got
into Grinnell, I said ‘Yayl' And then I said ‘Wait,”' said Vicki Horn
’04. Horn realized that sht felt bitter about plunging into four more
years ofschooltng right away, and she decided to defer her ndnrisrion
tor a yearwhile she traveled in New zcahnd and spent time in Lot
Angcles, Calif.

While in New zcaland, Horn designed her own volunteer pro.
gram while staying with a family in a suburb of Whrngarer. Shc
volunteered as a primary school tcacher's assistant and at an organic
papcrmill employing disabled persons. She received Certiﬁcation as a
pcrmaculturc design consultant, a program which reaches students
aboutsustainablc living, renewable agriculture, and organic farming.

"It was a difﬁcult decision.
Taking time off during my
senior year didn't make [0-
gistlcal sense, but it's made
all the difference in the
wayI live my life."
#Becca Zwerll'ng ’03

Horn also had the opportunity to purchase t car fairly cheaply
and travel throughout New zenland, “sleeping by the side or the
road, tlrntsorr of thing."

Horn even hunted for postums, a spouts which has vastly overs
populated New Zealand. “The gun yammcd, and the possum just sat
there and laughed at us whrlc the dog went berserk," the said with a,
laugh.

Horn praised the sense of‘mtioml community" she round in
New zcaland. “[va zcdarrd is] a huge cooperative train. There's s

very Old World generous philosophy, and
cveryorres dwayswulrrrg to help our," shesard.

She also commented on the varied cul»
tures that havo impacted New zealand's dc.
vclopment. Though New zealand is “more
British than the British," the indigenous Maori
also have a heavy lnﬂuence on New zcrland
culture. Recently, Ncw Zealmd has experi-
enced a ﬂux ofemigrants rrom the Asian pa.
ciﬁc.

Artcr returning to me u. S., Horn lived
in LosAngeles, madiusting and spending time
with her ftther. Though she enjoyed Los An:
gclcs' musiml and entertainment options, she
found a vastly diircrcnt attitude in Califor-
nia, an attitude in which people were much
more seltaawatc instead of community—focused. During her time in
Los Angelcs, Horn worked in a mall rn Beverly Hills and as aYMCA
lifeguard.

Political pastimes

Many students. like Horn, spent at least part ofthcir semalcr off

full time volunteer for the Green party. Sehricber began organia'ng

During his semester off, schricbcr fully rcdned his passion for
politicil organizing. “And I had real life experiences, which are better
than any classes," he said,

Hitting the beach

schrieber's roomrnatc, Joe Mowers ’02. also took the spring sc-
mecter ofhis sophomore year off from Grinncll. He rcalized that he
necdcd a change and wasn't happy “I don't know what would have

lrc said,

While tlrcic, Mowers also learned how to sort. “More than any.
thing. it was fun gcttrng out on the waves.“ he said. “When you gcr
out beyond the waves. you can just lie down on the board and feel
the matron," hesarti.

Though Mowers missed a semestcrorcomurrlcular activitiessrrch
as OFF-Season soccct eondrtromng and an active semester or Fl'P, hc
real rats that he learned valuable life lessons,

Massage and mediation

Despitc the vatrcd nature oftlieirexpericrrces outsrdc ofcrirrnell,
students shnrtd positive reactions to their time away, and many felt
they learned significantly from these experiences. “It was a very cool
growth experience," said Mike Fisher ’02. who deferred sdrnissiorr to
Grinncll for t year. His experiences from that your also affected his
future plsns, feeding his intcmt in international cnvironmental is-
sum and protection. In the yearbefore beginning college, Fisher trav—
eled, spending seven weeks in Western Europe, He attended massage
school in Oakland. “I thought my future wife might appreciate it,"
he said.

Fisher spent the fall semester at the National Outdoor Leader-
ship Sclrool, a program that teachos students wilderness first aid, map
reading, and other basics of wilderness survival and travcl. ,

Fisher yourncyed hurt to Costa Rica, whttc he stayed for three
months. He worked as an assistant to TraCy Foldrnan, a graduate
student studying the effects ofnonmative plants on the reproductive
cycles of butterflies indigcnous to Monte Verde.

Personal growrh comes through different meant, and one method
is meditation. By thc fall of 2000 Rachel N:vas 02 was not very
happy, had mononucleosis, and felt confused and unbalanced "its
so hard to be here, she said. Insrcdd orspending the ﬁrst semester of
her unior year abroad in India she decided to spend three months
in the spiritual Center ofAmcricn, a spiritual community located in
thc Blue Ridge mountains,

chrs’ parenu, both tcrchcrs oftmnscendental rncditation, taught
her to mtdrtatc when she was four years old. She first attended a
camp at the spiritual Contcr ofAmcrica when
she was 12.

Nevas spcntscptcrnber through November
meditating for seven hours each day, as well as
walking and learning about Vctlic Science, The
women's and men's sections of the Center were
scparatcd by mountains. “lr was kind of like
being at u nrrnnery,” Nevas said.

Novas described the promo orrneditutiorr
at an “cvolirtion ofeonscioirmess.“

"lt felt so good to get rrd of all that gar.
bage," Nevas said. “But it's really mtcmt: cona
fronting yourself."

Novas still meditates two hours every day.
Though she fcItn-uppedin Grinncllbcforc tale
irrg trmc off, she now realizes that besides personal growth, shc gained
knovvlcdgcofthe impottanccofhcrsurroundings “Leaving Grinnell
makes you appreciate it." she said. Fisher also commentcd on the
positive effects ofexpctiencing different environments. Before that
time. "I won’t very mature. l was afraid of the world." Fisher said.
Then he paused for a moment. "l’m still very immature," Ire said
with a smile.

Though most students say that the decision to take time on, and
their experientcs onct: they do, arcnr entirely easy, after returning to
Grinnell. many believc dist thcy made the rightdccision. ltgave me
an enhanced perspective on life thatl can't imagine without my time
away." said chrling.
