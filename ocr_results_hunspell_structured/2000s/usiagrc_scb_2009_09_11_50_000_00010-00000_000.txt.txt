As you sip on your pop during lunch, did
you ever think that some people would claim
you were funding someone’s murder? The
Coca-Cola Company is currently at the cen-
ter of an international firestorm sparked by
serious allegations of unethical business pract
tiees including workers rights abuse, murders
involving union workers and intentional eat
vironmental destruction. More recently their
questionable business practices have prompted
over 190 colleges and universities across the
globe to start local campaigns against Coke.

On the Grinnell campus, the Grinnell Stut
dent Peace Action Network (GSPAN) is lead
ing the effort for a campusrwide boycott of
CocatCola products, The group's passionate
leaders Sarah Goff '11, Heather Riggs '12 and
Kate Mocning '12 are conﬁdent that Gtinnell
students are ready and willing to malte the
change to a Coke product free campus.

Moening and Goffwcre inspired to start a
“Killer Coke" campaign after attending a cone
ference on the School ofAmcricas where they
learned about Coke’s dealings with paramilit
tary units “Grimtcll has a strong tradition and
commitment to social justice,"Moening said.
“It would seem to contradict what we stand
for, and we should live up to our name even if
it is a tough decision.”

GSPAN has planned a number of ll‘lllﬂr
tives this year to jumpstart the Killer Coke
campaign. Riggs said they will start by focus
ing on awareness “A lot orpeople don‘t know
about [GSPAN and Killer Coke]," Riggs said.
GSPAN plans to change this by putting on
events and workshops highlighting the uneth-
ical practices of coca Cola. The olganization
also hopes to bring in speakers from the nae
tronal Killer Coke campaign, which provides
numerous resources to its local afﬁliated orgat
nizations

The group believes that the goal is achieve
able by the end orthis academic year, and plans
to build solid student support while engaging
the administration. “We want to make suie

GSPAN brings national campaign to campus to ban “Killer Coke” products

the administration is our ally, while haVing the
necessary student support to move forvm ,"
Riggs said. “Ideally, we’d like to replace Coke
with local products, but those are things we
will work on and create a spirit or boycott, so
that students won’t even buy it for a party like
at McNally’s."

Dining Hall Director Dick Williams res
mains neutral on the subject. He said that
since the IRC opened in fall 2005, Grinnell
Dining has elected not to do business exclu-
sively with the Coca-Cola company. “We
have no type of contract with Coke," he said.
“We provide over 42 varieties of beveragew
PepsitCola, Coke, and Dr. Pepper are all ope
tions,"Williarns said that ridding the campus
ofCokc products “is possible, but it's a process
and it requires that all the student handbook
procedures, regulations and school policies are
properly followed.”

On the international level, Coke continues
to battle allegations in high proﬁle lawsuits.
In 2003, United Steelworkers ofAmcrica and
SINALTRAINAL (Sindicato Nacional de
Trabajadorcs dc la lndustria dc Nimentos, or,
the National Union of Food Industry Works
ets) filed a lawsuit against the Coca»Cola
Company. The lawsuit alleges that Colte's
contracts with paramilitary units~which pro
vide the security at the bottling plant57has alt
lowed for “these professional military soldiers"
to bully, torture and kidnap union afﬁliated
workers to drive down the wages.

According to the Killer Coke website there
have been a total ofitiiic confirmed murders
of union leaders in thc Colombia Coca»Cola
bottling plant alone since 2002. In 2006, the
case was dismissed by the Supreme Court on
the grounds that Coca Cola could not be held
liable for local bottlers, Just two weeks ago,
another lawsuit was dismissed against Coke
on the grounds that the plaintiff, SINALt
TRAINAL, did not provide enough evidence.

in response to the various allegations,Col(e
has launched a website, www.gul/bnm{ﬁic1i,
mm. The website states,"In Colombia, a coun»

try where 4 percent ofworkers are unionized,
31 percent orthe employees ofCoca-Cola Co-
lombian bottling partners belong to unions."

The website also published details of a
third-party investigation through Internationt
al Labor Organization (ILO) in their Column
bia bottling plants. The investigation reported
that no wrongdoing was found and all work
and legal standards were up to par. However,
some dispute the credibility of this investiga-
tion due to the fact that is was founded by
Coke and the U.S. delegate to the ILO, Ed
Potter, is also Coca-Cola’s global relations die
rector.

While the level or colte's culpability re-
mains undecided on an international level,
GSPAN will lead Grinnell students to
question the company's practices and de
cide how they weigh in. “That’s a givcni
[that big businesses engage in unethical
practicesJ,” said Christian Loggins ’12.
“But it doesn’t affect my everyday
decisions.”

GSPAN’s message,
however. is that pot
rcntially unethical
behavior should
affect our daily
decisions—and
we should act
on it. We may
not know
for sure
whether or
not Coke is
killer, but
it probably
would not
