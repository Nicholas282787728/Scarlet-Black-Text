Cures for the February Doldrums

By Paul Fender
S’ial‘iColumnisi

Yes, we are currenrly righr in rhe middle of
rho worsr srrereh of rhe academic year ar
Grinnell, a period Ted bmdford ‘93 aprly warned
me as a Freshman was rhe “long haul." It’s cold,
we are reared by warm wearher, rhe Super Bowl
has come and gone, Disco seems rar away, and
spring break looms like a mirage over rhc corn»
Flclds, At a rirne such as this one needs whole.
some activitics ro salvage rhe monrh. have
some ion, and most imporranrly to mainrain
sanity,

one common suggesrion often given is ro
hole up in your room, turn up rhe hcar, crack
open your books, and bear rhe doldtums rhrough
academic success. This is rhe firsr horrible,
horrible, rnerhod of coping rliar needs ro be dis.
carded like a memo from Osgood. What also
need ro be reieered as a means of dealing wirh
this period are rhe Forum, Herrick Chapel,
Burling, l-larris, any academic ralk, dorm
lounges, study breaks, rho dining halls, or any
other “all-campus" evenr or acriviry. Whnr some
rore as a solurion are in facr rhe problems.

But nor ro fear, we here or rhe sacs have been
up nights brainstorming, theorizing, and even
exporimenring to bring you rhe best activities
ro beor your February doWners. so here in no
parricular order are rhe scientifically proven
besr ways ro solve your blues:

Sledding: Slcdding ar tirsr may sound like a
hopeless pipedream on rhis campus (and state),
bur drum is in her a serviceable hill or rhe golt
once rhe hill has been found, many
srudenrs have rrouhle procuring a sled. As a
vcremn of raiding rhe Corleron mess hall, l can
rell you that cafereria rreys are deccni, but rhey
have limitations. The besr solurion ro this is ro
lust go ro rhe hill and sreal a sled from some
lirrle kids, They have rhe loresr designs and

course.

colors, and mosr of rhe lirrle tikcs will gladly lcr
you “borrow“ rheir sleds rs long as you rhreeren
ro stick rheir heod in a snow book.
Develop an arch»nernesise Now some
people mighr warn you rhar having enemies is
foolishness at a school rhis small, but rhcy are
missing our on rhe big picrurc, It you are going
ro have a nemesis, you might as well nor mess
around abonr it Repeored conraer also means
more opporruniries for erare»downs, mind»
genres, and most imporranrly violence. Just
think of how much honor your day will be ai‘rer
you knock someones rray over in rhc dining
halls. People who complain abour rhis place
being roo small obviously haven'r tried sralking
someone—and in rhis aspecr Grinnell is a para-
dise.

Date a townie: There are plenty of opporru-
niries out there for borh men and women alike.
If you are hnving rrouble. you probably aren't
burning enough rubber in rhe high school park-
ing lor, or nor going ro rhe scare srreer Bar ev.
ery week. Sure, rhis sorr of rhing has gorren
kind of a bad rap over rhe years. but if done for
all rhe righr rersonr»ro enre boredomeir can
really be rurned into a repurable, and possibl)
“Fund for Excellence" supporred acriviry.

Drinking: Obviously there are inherent risks

'in advising rhis ro young p:ople,'but if done rhe

righr way, rhere can be no objecrions_even from
school adminisrrnrors. It’s rhe people who iusr
“have a fewl’on weekends who hove given this
wholesome depressionesroppcr o dirry name, The
are rhe ones rhar havc ro bring everyone back ro
reality and ruin ir for those with rho puresr inren»
tions. As a Wis: man once said, “There isn’t any»
rhing wrong with blowing off a lirrle sream 5-6
nights a week", and ifwe can caprure rhe essence
of this rheroric we will all be well on our way to
resurrecring our menrol spirirs.

Inside Out

By Nozli Eginlioglu
Staff Columnist

Whenever I think about the sum»
mer, i remember my shock when I
first arrived at Grinnell for New Stu-
dent Orientation in the summer of
1998. back rhen, rhere was one ques—
rion my parcnrs and I asked our»
selves repeatedly: "Where are the
people?"

There was no one walking about
in the streets, no kids running about,
no backyards trashed with kids toys'.
only Grinnell srudenrs, noticeable
since they highly contrast town
people (or contrasting anyone for
that mattcr). [t was hard to believe
people lived in this rown since rhere
were not many traces of humans in

Grinnell. It seemed like this place
was ruled by silence I assumed that
life in Gtinnell must
be going on indoors.
At all times. Were
people living in this
town trapped in-
doors, or were they
,usr indoor friendly?

Even rhough my
parents and I were
treated kindly, it was
made clear to us that
we were way out of
line for Grinnell.
Who but an outsider
demands a dinner at
9:30 pm. afrer all?
Who laughs loudly? Who tries to
find out if there is a cab station in
town? \X/ho walks about after 10
pin?

 

“ Who but an out»
sidet demands dinner
at 9:30 pm after all?
Who laughs loudly?
Who tries to ﬁnd out
if there is a cab station
in town? Who walks

about after 10 pm? ”

I Found out why everything was
so different from what l am used to,
about
months latcrr Even
rhough Grinnell
has three months
of beautiful sums
met, wtntcr deﬁ-
nitely put its mark
on the character of
this (own People
do not walk about
because they are
used to driving,
which they prefer
to do in the win»
rer. People live in»
doors because that
is how they are used to living when
it is cold.

However, ir is srill surprising ro
me how people living in Grinnell

three

trcat summer. We long so much for
summer while we at: in winter. We
make plans to go somewhere warm
for spring break. On the ﬁrst sunny
day ofspring I often observe people
walking around barefoor and in tank
rops. i see a sudden increase in rhe
number of girls wearing skirts on
sunny days even when rhe wearher
is honestly not that warm.

However, when summer comes there
is anorher increase in compIainrs about
how hot it is how humid it is, how but-
ing ir is. Since rhen rve heard many sru-
denrs say rhey wanr to live in Norris since
it has air-conditioning despite its mini»
mal lounges on each ﬂoor and claustro»
phobic corridors.

At the end of the day, Grinnellians
cherish winter. summer is a phase be-
tween the two more profound: the Win-
tct past and the wrnrer to Come.
