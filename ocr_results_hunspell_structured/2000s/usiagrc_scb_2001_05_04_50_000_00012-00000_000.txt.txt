I’ve been consrdering becoming a fa—
mous sports columnist like Sports
Illustrated’s Rick Reilly Sure, Reilly paid
his dues as a hard-working sports re—
porter before he became famous, but I’m
hoping to spring to stardom faster than
those guys who sang the “Macarena.”1
have no plans to have my own dance to

accompany my column, though.

ouee I ger tired from rhar ioh for‘inappropriare eommenrs."
my lasr resorr is re he a ghosrwrirer for professional arhleres
looking ro write their biographies. I’ve always wanied to have
my name prinred in minuseule iype nndernearh the name or
some two-bit linebacker who played 23 professional minutes
in his life on rhe dust iaeker ofhis biography

Basically, whar I’m saying is rhar l have no hope for a eareer
in sports wriring arrer Grixinell. I'm going in srarr looking righr
now ror a place that pays six ﬁgures for someone to analyze
capr. Kirk's eharaerer in rerms orwnham Wordsworth's po-
erry.
