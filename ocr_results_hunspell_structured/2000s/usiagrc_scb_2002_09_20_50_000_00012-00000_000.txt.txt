a reason that Iowa laws

Lessons on Quad dining

To all shose who ear as Quad:

Many oryou areeonrused abour she proper way so dine as Quad.
Les me explain so you, brieﬂy, a few ofth: finer poinu.

First, and moss imposranrly, you muss undesssand how so ssand
in line. DO NOT wsap she line around and badsous inso she logia.
The proper way so form a line inso Quad is so extend is shrough she
doors inso she Main foyer. Coming in from she
loggia. one should drop oeone's beelspadsand/
or Jacket and proeeed shrough she doors so she
hack of she line. The line should take up only
she spac: orshe door elosess so Quad, allowing
she osher door for people so pass shrough.

There are logical seasons for shis ssyle oflrnc.
First. shis is iowa, very soon is will ges sold out-
side, and she loggiz will rhus ges very eold. Main
is heased. seeond, shese is no reason so ssand in
linevvish a baekpaehand iaehes when one eould
drop shem on before gessing in lsne. bursher.
more, when winser does roll around, addisional
eoas racks for Quad diners are plaeed in Main.
nowhere near she curr=nr pnth ofrhc lineThird. she line inso Main
is ssraighser, easier so follow. and raises up less space. Finally, she eon.
gcxrcd line inso she loggia makes is very dimeuls for nnyone soming
from anywhere bur she loggia so ger inso line. Main residenrs, ror
inssrnee, have so go ourside and around while a line inso Main allows
easy assess from all enhances. The Main foyer ssyle or line simply
makes more sense; i eannos think ora single benehs orrhis serpen.

Life with a bike

W
true methods for easy
Quad dining, the result of
what bio majors call
”evolution," what the rest
of us call "common sense.”

erasser, While 1 undesssand shas many or you have nos yes spens an
ensire semesser eating in Quad, shese are oersain rules you should
have liarned by now. For inssanee. DO NOT salee your srsy so she
beverage bar. has your my on she salad barirh: deli bar is NOT she
salad bar—or pus your sray as your sable, ges yourdsinles, and rennn
so your sray. When many people are in line so ges drinks, a ssay
dissurbs she ﬂow considerably and hussnses ev.
esyone around. And irshere are nos loss oipeople
in line so gesdrinles, shese is probably more rhan
enough room as she salad bsr for your nay.
Osherwise, please juss be eonsiderase oforhe
ers. The food in she dining hall is shese ror eve
eryone. Don't srenl she honey. Don's dump a
whole sub orgnlled chicken irom she salad bar
onso your prose and earl is a meal. Don't srand as
she deli bar or rare bar for extended periods or
sime wefullyqzﬁing she perfectsandwich/mco,
pus she mnterlzls on your plase and do is as your
sable. Don’s be obnoxious in she drink line, cut-
sing inso she ﬂow orsralrie so bees she next per.
son so she wares mashine.
plsose eonsider shese suggessions. Dining at Quad does nos al.
ways have so be srressrul and heesse, bus is salres soopesasson, or as
loan genersl emeieney, in order for shas so happen. These are she
ssied and srue sneshods for easy Quad dining, she resuls ofwhar bio
majors oall “evolurion.” what she ress orus earl “eommon sense." if
anyone has addisional suggessions, I urge rhns person so share. unssl
shen, eould we as leass form a ssraighs line?

Punctuation problems

Students speak out
about what’s on
their minds ind/+2
words, and you’re
invited! If you have
a random rant, email
it to me at
alward@grinnell.edu.
After all, complain-
ing in a public forum
is always more fun '
than doing it alone.

I want light. There's a street light on the southern
border of8th Street between ARH and Vounker. I drown
in darkness when I take a walk in this vicinity at night.
Between bumping into people and tripping in construc-
tion zones, the absence of that light poses some seri»
ous health risks And still nobody bothers to turn on
the light. I don't think it‘s an economic issue. How
much money does the school waste on forcing us to
bring not only our books but our parkas to class in
ARH? That 62 degree blast of air doesn’t accommodate
my shorts and tank tops too welt So let’s transfer some
of the energy used to freeze ARH to burn the light
outside ARH. We're always talking about enlightenment
as a product of the Grinnell experience, right? Light
would be the logical ﬁrst steps

~Erin Petty ’04

Bikes: a lot of my friend: have them, and if I were
lazier or lived off campus, I would too. WhatI wouldn’t
do it! had a bike, is assume that I have the right of
way on every pathway on campus, nearly run people
over and give them a dirty look when they don’t move
out of my ways I also wouldn’t leave my bike in the
middle of the loggia, because if I did some idiot who
walks might bump into it, or get run into it in their
attempt to dodge a fellow biker passing them. Most of

' all, in wet and muddy weather conditions, I would not

speed past those stupid people that walk because, not

being a click, I would realize that they might get mud

splashed all over them. But I don’t have a bike.
-Brian Elites ’05

Like many people, I have a problem with punc—
tuation and how every time I use it I end up getting
a lot of little red marks on my papers indicating that
I have a problem with punctuating which I’ve already
come to terms with and I don’t need little marks on
my papers telling me that even the periods at the
end of my sentences are in the wrong places causing
sentence fragments or run-on sentences, so I think I
need punctuation rehabilitation instead, which is a
new type of rehab clinic needed for those of us who
can pen admit uurissues with punctuation marks and
that we need help from our communityin the form of
a student organization with a snappy name like Stu»
dents Against Problem Punctuators and they could
organize parties or form support groups for those of
us who would like to end our sentences but never
know when to.
