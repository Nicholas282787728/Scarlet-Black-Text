Puzzles of pride

Student panelists and guest speaker ponder the possibility of gay marriage during Pride Week

by Emilia Garvey

“People say StoneCo like it‘s mking your vimmins," said Sarah Lu ‘07,
“It doesn’t sound like fun, it sounds like something you have to do, Part of
what pride is about is being gay and thinking rhar it’s fun." She was speak.
ing ro a formidable crowd in rhe Forum sourh lounge on Monday after.
noon, as parr orrhc student panel “on Same Sex Marriage and Pride.”

Aquestion from an audience member prompted discussion aboutsoli-
dariry, srudenr interesr and stoneCo, “We srruggie with the paradox of
making sure rhar Stoneco can be borh personal and political every year,"
said Kare Srrangio ’05.

This years Pride week evenrs had boih personal and political signifi.
cance for rheir panelists. speakers, and audience, or leasr in part beads: of
rhe advances in rhe tight for gay marriage. Although Monday's panelisn
did nor have explicir experience with gay marriage, rhey expressed a vari-
ety ofsenrimenrs about irs implication. “It’s not some
dung that I’ve really rhoughr about,” said Lu, “but
I’m interested in fighting for ir because ir means a lor
ro many gay people."

“I dont have a guttural urge to be married,” said
Sarah Hansen 04, noting that she questioned rhe as
similarion inherenr in the institution of marriage

When people think otihemselves as gay rhey don't
necessarily think about where they stand on gay mare
riage,“ Srrangio added,

While rhe hghr for gay marriage may be moie po
litical than personal for Grinnell students, it has taken
on borh meanings for Maura strassberg, Tuesday
night's speaker on “Tl-re Furure ofSarnc.Sex Marriage
in America.“ As a professor of law at Drake University who reaches a
graduate course on Sexuality in the Law, she hen written a number of
articles on monogarny, polygamy and polyamory in rlie law, as well a
extensively studying same sex marriage. She also recendy obtained a civil
union in Vermont with her partner, Grinnell College philosophy protes-
sor Johanna Meehan. “We’ve been together for 20 years. You mighr ask,
why borher, knowing rhe renuous nature ofit?" said srrassberg. “Burl
rcaiimd that to walk into a town hall and ask for a license and not face
bigotry or homophobia, no marrer how much you sreel yourseifagainsr
those things, felt incredible."

Although Srrassberg has a personal srake in rhe marrer, she addressed
the legal issues ofgay marriage, civil unions and arteniprs ro define mar—
riage as a solely heterosexual institution from many directions. The Mas
sachusern Supreme Court ruling diar not allowing gay marriage is uncon»
srirurional, she says, has made ir such that “it will be 2006 before they can
absolutely ourlaw gay marriage."

Since the Massachuserrs court explicitly stared thar gay marriage wu
consririirionaliy sound, Strassberg explained rhe impiimrions ofthe word,

”I realized that to walk
into a town hall and ask
fora license and not face
bigotry or homophobia
felt incredible."

~Maura Strassberg

Marriage, she said, is importanr because people believe “if we have rhe
same word, we have rhe saine righu."

There are l049 legal benefirs or marriage rlrar could porenrialiy be
errended to gay couples. A civil union does not guarantee the same ben—
efirs. In response ro a couple possessing a civil union and requesring one of
these righrs, the federal governmenr ruled thar civil unions “do not bestow
the siarus ofeivil marriage," said sriassberg. “This was basieiliy a kick in
rhe ieerli ro rhe power ofcivil unions."

studenrs on Mondays panel as well as in the audience at strassbergls
Tuesday night ralk expressed concerns abour rlre potential backlash and
opposition ro gay marriage trom ronservarives it is not an accident.
srmssberg said, that rhe some of the same people who oppose gay mar-
riage and civil unions support covenant marriage, which makes ir, among
orherrhings, harderro get a divorce Manysrudenrsarboth panels men»

Panelisrsittrredo Rivera‘OS and Sarah Hansen ‘04
also pondered rhe causes ofstagnarion in studenr ate
nvism, “we forget rhar outside rhe Grinnell bubble it

nor matter,” said Rivera. Hansen argued rhar rhe
bubble ends rhiee blocks away, partly because ofrlie
political armosphere that keeps schuerer in ofhce.

As many of those who oppose gay marriage be.
come more conservativ , marriage mighr begin ro look
more like a solely conservative institution, “Marriage
is seen by many as inexrricably ried to religious and
metaphysical norions about men and women," said
Strassberg. because ofrliis, she explained, some liber.
als might ask, "ifyou offer people marriage will they give up rheir radical—
ness and just join rhe PTA?"

Although legally ﬂawed, ciry othcials performing marriages in San
Francisco and elsewhere can be a symbolically compelling radical acr,
Srrassberg said. “Civil disobedience has an impacr on public opinion," she
said. in San Francisco we are seeing rhe reality, iarlter rhan the unknown
bogeyman. .Peopie recognize rhat it looks like a eivii righrs movemenr."

The celebrarion ofgay pride arose from the stonewall riors, a confronr
rarion berween police and gay ciriaens in New York City in 1969. “h vos

Sriangio on Monday, "This year’s pride relebrarion comes in rhe wake of
violent events such as Births supporr ofa consrirurional amendmenr ban.
ning gay marriage."

Whether or nor rhose celebraring this years Pride week are polirieally
or personally engaged in rhe fight tor gay marriage at hand, rhe debate
over rhe issue has given the cloeer coinmuniry a vi ble presence nation»
wide. “visibility is part ofpride." said strangio. “Visibility in all its mani-
fesrarions will always be valuable.”
