Alternate routes to art

av KWON YANG

Undcr the soft light of the Faulconer Gallery, a
motley collection of artworks clashes despite the dime
ncssr Pastoral landscape watercolors hang alongside
abstract smooth linear terms in a warm rust color by
a pixilatcd projection of horizontal strips ora larger,
colorful painting.

Grinnell alumni and faculty who created the
hodgepodge displayed in the Faulconer Gallery ex-
hibit these works in “Artists at and after Grinnell."
Their works and oral accounts document the varied
journeys people take from Grinnell students to pmr
fessional artist.

“Alternate Route," the abstract palercolotcd paint—
ing and its creator, Susan Arthur
‘91, represent the winding road that
leads Grinnell alumni to art. Arthur
graduated as a History major. After
several years of odd jobs, Arthur arr
rived to pursue art through graduate
school. “When I went to gradu-
ate school I was quite serious and I
knew it was for a short time and I
would have to get back to life, what-
ever it might be," she sa . Since graduating from
the University of Nebraska incoln’s graduate school
in 1999, she has experimented mainly with abstract
paintings. Her work was displayed in a solo exhibit at
the Bowery Gallery in New York City in 2004.

Bobby Meltibbin, Art, creator of some pastoral
paintings in the exhibit, taught all the alumni in the
exhibit except one, and in her opinion, Arthur's aca-
demic undergraduate experience is typical. According
to McKibbin, artist Gregory Gomez ’80 came from
a long line of doctors but decided to major in Art at
Grinnell. Sheldon Tapley’SD, also a former art student
featured in the exhibit, was originally a Chemistry
major but decided to become an Art major because “it
was harder than chemistry"

Recently arrived professor Lee Running, Art, em-
phasizcd the importance of Grinncll’s commitment

to community to help the artists develop their arts
work, no matter what their academic focus or future
goals. “Art is a lonely pursuit,” she said. “It is some
thing people do often alone in a studio with no other
witnesses so I think one ofthe most important things
that Grinnell can provide for its arts students is a
community ofpeers.You have people to talk to about
what you are doing you have people to notice the
sort of the visual progress that you are making.”

Whether or not aspiring artists take full advantage
of the Grinnell arts community and art classes, McK-
ibhin said further art education is critical, and she
fully advocates Arthur's path. “Ifyou are serious about
art you need to go to graduate school," she said.

Arthur advised conflicted art
students to consider the lifestyle of
an artist before deciding to become
artists. “I remember an art teacher
that once said to me when someone
asks, ‘How can you make it work?’
and she said, ‘It’s just simple. You
are simply going to have to decide '
you are going to love the life what-
ever that means.’It seemed like such
a kind of a nothing statement when I ﬁrst heard it,
because what does that mean? Love the life? Love the
life ofheing an artist? She didn’t mean it in a particu-
larly romantic way. She meant it in a way that you just
have to decide that whatever that life holds, whether
it's times of difficulty or times when you are more fr
nancially comfortable, whatever that means, what you
really Care about is making the art, you are going to
ﬁnd a way to do it."

Arthur is now deeply immersed in the life of
painting that she has to remind herself not to lose
perspective. “There is a lot of stepping back,"'she said.
“You know. when i am working the large paintings I
would be frequently evaluating and revaluating and
making a decision about where the next mark will be.
It's just the importance ofseeing it and its entirety so
ifI am so close to the work, I won’t get a sense ofit."
