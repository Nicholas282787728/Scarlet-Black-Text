the rhythm of iingling bells. Em Torner ’04 declted out

ballad

These widely mied dancers and dances are part ofa
practice for the upcoming belly dance performance on
Tuoday, May it at 9 p.m. at the Wall. They illustrate the
main purpose ofthe ExCo belly dance class. “It's really just
about enjoying your body," said Allen—Tonar, one ofthrec
instructors forclass. “Belly dam: is based on a lot ol'move-
ment that comes naturally to many people so it’s very ac—
cessible, very useful, very applicable to others to instill
confidence."

belly dancing is an inclusive and ﬂadbl: creative me»
dium. One ofrhe main challenges that instructors Allen-
Tonar, Molly Obsatz '05 and Sophie Nye loo face during
class is convincing dancers to embrace that idea. The stu-
dents giggle during waxm»up, ofﬁcially titled “Shimmy with
Electra.” They hold hands in a circle, copying Electra's
movements, tentatively at ﬁrst, and then with more conﬁr
dents as Electra specds things up. Chests and butn jiggle
as the dancers go faster and faster to keep up with Electra.

They release hands as the music speeds up, shaking
their hips and shoulders at a ferocious speed. They break
up into giggly confusion when they glance at themselves

in the mirrors. “We are all belly dancers with exciting arms,”
said belly dancer Ellie Kemple loo, eliciting more gigglcs
as the dancers reioin hands.

Many in the class have never danced before and these
studeno especially have trouble shedding their bashfulness.
“It's hard to get people, because we have such varied body
types, which belly dance invites," said Obsao, ”including
sltinny altinny boys, including teeny tiny girls, including
not teeny tiny girls and women who have had several chil-
dren, to accept the way Lhcir body looks doing something
and accept the {not it’s beautiful.”

Obsao and Allen-Tonar are pleased to tee that many
students this semester, both beginner and intermediate,
are becoming comfortable performing solos or in small
groups and infusing theitown style into dielrdanmtAllen-
Tonar's duct with Tornot represents the expression orcon—
theme and personality for both student and teacher: “I
have neverbelly danced with a boy,” said Allen»Tonar, "and
he's going to wear his hat!" During practice, Tomor throws
in energetic new moves, yelling, “Fuck it let's lteep goingi"
while AllenaTonar copies him. His antics cause the audi.
ence to shout “version 2.71" as he flexes his creativity and
refines hit dance, hat on head,

the belly dance class. “We have come up with a lot more
ways to get the intermediates moving, that don’t necessal'v
ily involve us teaching things," said obsao, “but rather
them coming up with things and everybody sharing. We
try to get people to loosen up enough to play with the
movements.” Since belly dance is highly individual, the

teachers encourage students to draw from their own inter»
cats and hobbies to develop their own personal style.

incorporate Emanat: attitude into their piece to modiiy
belly’s traditionally coy flirtatiousncss to include a more
forward attitude, to the tune ofshaltita’s qornn: Near the
end or the dance, Kempie ioltingly begins to make her
hands down Kolbek’s cheat, interrupting herselfwith: “Not
in Emanarel Nevermindi"

Despite their joking, studeno are aware that such cx.
perimentation with personal expression is what belly is all
about. The personal orpression will be evident not only in
the rypcdance, but also the music and costumes ofTuesday's
performance. “This semesrtr, there italot more autonomy,"
said Allens‘l‘onar. “It becomes a very personalized thing.”

The teachers hope to help not only the students but
also the audience ﬁnd the belly inside them. At the up.
coming performance, the dancers will encourage the audi-
ence to “Shake it widt Plectra” so they too can experience
the excitement of belly techno style. “You will learn to
shake your ass better than you have ever shalten it before,“
said Obsara.

The students will introduce the audience to the world
of shimmies, raxims and mayas, all belly moves that get
asses moving and aelfeonfdence and self—expression ﬂow.

to the bear or henrtpounding techno, iingling bells and
