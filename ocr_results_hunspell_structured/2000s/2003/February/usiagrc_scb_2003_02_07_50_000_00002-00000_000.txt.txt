A body once criticized as a "boys club" has experienced a
DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT. Most of this semester’s Crop of Joint
Board hall senators are female, Thirteen of 21 current senators
are women, with the potential for one more depending on a
revote in Loose Hall, SGA Administrative Coordinator Liz Allan
’04 said she was pleased to see "what appears to be more
diversity' but noted that "the real test of SGA’S openness is
whether or riot everyone in that room on Wednesday nights
feels comfortable , LOOSE HALL will hold another senator
election to ﬁnd their second Joint Board representative of the
Semester, This announcement came after former senator Ned
Brasington ’05 announced that he would be unable to serve
after being elected as a writecin in last week's elections. The
new Senator will be elected today (Friday) and will most likely
serve on the AllcCampus Events (ACE) Committee a . Elections
for the SGA PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT are rapidly
approaching. Statements of intent are due to Administrative
Coordinator Liz Allan on February let.
