"My best Valentine's Day was last year, when I went out on a first date to see the
mow'e Amelie, which is the most romantic movie ever. After the movie we dmve to
the beach. It was really cool and really romantic."

”My sophomore year in high school, my boyfriend gave me two dozen roses
and a better half card that you normally give to a spouse. It freaked me out,
and I ended up dumping him two weeks later.”
—Jlll Harms '05

"Ihls one time, I sent this girl a Valentine's noteiit was a weLLepenned ’secret
admirel’ note. I retreated who I was a day later, and she went out with me for six
weeks. I think it was all because of that note. ihen atone point, she was like, you
know what? I don't really like you! And that was that. But it taught me a valuable

lesson: it’s always better to curl up in the fetal position and sob on Valentine's

Day than to actually do anything. rhat/s something I’ve taken to heart and wiLL

teach to my kids." -

special things that they were going to do for their girlfriends on Valentine’s
Day. My mom overheard and felt sorry for me since I didn't have a girlfriend,
rhere was a tradition on Valentine's Day to deliver ﬂowers to your significant
other in first period. When I got to ﬁrst period, there were 12 red roses in a
. a\ vase on my desk. I guickty checked the cardithey were from my mom. I
immediately Left class with the flowers and stuffed them in my locker, but rt
was too late. As usual, I had been running late, and my friends had
already read the note. lwas called Mama's Boy for the rest of the day."

in the backseat of my car, 1 saw this big flash of Light outside the car.
before 1 knew it, three top cars surrounded us and guestioned what we were
doing there. they threatened to arrest us for indecency and lascivious actions or
something like that. Needless to say, we were let go and i quickly drove my
boyfriend home,"

find these Valentineeretated presents. like a nice red shirt. And I got chocolates.

Grinnell students and faculty share
I Valentine’s Day memoriesﬁboth
I the good and the bad

"Last year on Valentine's Day afternoon I was studying in my

room (it only gets worse) when someone knocked on my door.

Standing there was an elderly man, Looking winded and beleaguered

and frail, wielding a lovely potted plant iw'th pink and red foil paper

and a how around the base. He showed me the name on the (aid
envelope and asked wearily rfthe name was mineAthe letters were
scrawled and some didn't look exactly n'ght, but I felt pressure. so I said
yes. ’Sure took me a Long time to find you: he said as he left and as I
imagined him to years younger, buffer and without the orthopedic shoes.

”I Looked at the envelope again. It was suspicious. I wasn't expecting
anything. I plated the plant on my vrindowsilt. I admired it. Then Iopened the
card. It was signed 'love Mom and Dad: This was vexing, as my dad died a few
years ago and I knew my mom had already sent me something. I sent a quick
email to my mom. Mistake. She was shocked and angry and just sure someone
was being intentionally hurtful. Though I quitkly dismissed it, such a
theory didn't exactly boost my selfeconfidence or spirits.

”So now I had a Valentine that wasn't mine, a mom that was wildly
mad and, well, not much else. I watered the plant a bit and admired it
from the corner where I sat alone and linValentined. It was about three
hours bter before I got on diretton] seanh and looked for names
similar to mine. Finally I found one, a girl two ﬂoors below me, looked
at the card again, and realized yes, it was her name.

"I descended the stairs, knocked on her door and very timidly and
apologeticatly explained I’d received the plant accidentally, I was sorry I'd opened
its card and watered its tendered roots and I hope she didn't mind. I think I got an
'oh, thanks' and than silence. I retreated quickly.

”So I spent all day thinking about this stupid Valentine plant, only to get
separated and abandoned and ignored. It was a harrowing experience, actually,
though it probably sounds Lame. Take that last word and put it in front of 'Elisa's
Valentine’s Day 2002: and you’ve got it about right.”

”My best Valentine's Days have included extravagant quantities and
qualities of sensual delights, such as chocolate, whipped cream,
strawbernes, champagne, flowers, greenngs of love from friends and family
and time with partner and husband Mike. (This Friday will be rather unique:
I’ll be vn'th Mike at a meeting in Santa Fe, giving a miniLecture on the health
benefits of chocolate)“

—Syll/ia Though-Smith, sociology

”A fnend of mine once told me that her ex-boyfriend gave her ror Valentine's
Day little heart-shaped candies, but not the normal ‘Sweetheart’ ones. instead of
phrases like I Love you,’ they had uplifting phrases such as 'Just a friend:
Proofthat the market economy does respond to needs of those searching
for the perfect gifts for one-night stands and typical Grinnell romances,”

things were set to be great... We started the evening by lvandenng
through the snowdnfts to (die Phoenix. It was a double date with her
roommate and my best friend. Dinner went smashingly, and while the other
couple decided to go back, there was a (horal performance at the nearby
church that we decided to go to. By the time we got back, her roommate had Left
their room. but there was a note on the door from her roommate telling us that
she had left a speml CD in the CD player and that all we needed to do was to
press play and Light the candles. As I busied mysetfwith this, my girLfnend
checked her messages and declared that she had to call her parents. Then i sat
on the bed looking really bored for an hour. rhats where the story ends.” .
