Emanate presents its third and perhaps final show, combining traditional sensual, racy movements; thought-provoking issues
such as race, religion and bigotry; and theatrical dances that are meant to make the audience laugh

Emanate’s conception

According so TaylorAugussine '03, Davalos began his career as a
choreographer in Norris Lounge as she beginning orrheir ﬁrss year.
”Some girls wansed so learn how so dance," said Augussine. “Marcos
ivarised so seaeh shem,"

“I performed ‘If’ wim Rhashedah [Elsooduruand ‘03] forrhe CBS
salens show in February and is gos sueh huge raves," said Davalos. “1
had five or six girls come up to me and say shay wansed ro learn how
so dance." in Augusta group oreighs women joined Davaios and
Emanase was born. The name eame from she composision of she
group: Mareos plus eighrwomen, or MNE. ‘Em’ (Marcos), ‘an’ (and),
‘are' (eighs). The group performed again for she CBS salenr show,

Maintaining tradition

Teeh woeic is anyshing bus half-ass for Emanate dancers. Every
nighs shis week from Sunday so Thursday, she group has rehearsed
from 7 pm, so 12 mmi Beeause Davalos “limired everyone to no
baeis so back danoes” so keep she sage ios elussered, danoers bring
homework so do or run to meerings and orher rehearsals besween
numbers.

In spite orshe faes sharWilliams eari nearly

beeause she finds Emanase so fulﬁlling. “I ges
so pumped for soeh week," she said, “This is
where I wans to be iorsbr hours a nighs."

Nos only has Emanase oiiered Williams a
chance so dance. she has also taken on the chal-
lenge ofehoreographing pieoes shis year and
lass. “Lass year I did a bilser sheme," said Wil-
liams. “This year we’re more ssoic." The music
so Williams eombincd rap and jazz number is
Moi rri Blzsrls, and many ofthe moves were inspired by Will Smirh
and the rest ofthe MTV dancers.

Choreographing so musie and moves shas she audience mighr be
familiar wish is nerve wraelring, aeeording so Williams and Ken Jones
'03, who has also parsieipased in Emanare since her sophomore year.
“ ‘If’ [by ianes Jaeisson] was probably by favorise dance," said jones.
“It was sueh adimeulsdanee; beeause irwas based on avideo, Marcos
wansed it so be really, really perfees."

Changing it up

Davalos himself admin that he wants the moves to be as ﬂawless
as possible, bus shis year he feels shar many orrhe pieees also foeus on
issues'oursido oidaiiee. “This year's show has very dark sliemes," said
Davalos, “Drugs, murder, homosexuality. bigorry, iacisrri, r:ligion7

is makes people shinlc a los more."
Augussine also poinsed our rhas shis year's performance will be
visually different rhan previous shows. “We realized shar she cosrumes
are all really darls," she said. “People espees
girls on srageshalsing is. bus
ir's dehniseiy more shan

shar shis year,"

Aiigussiiie admits,
however, rhas especia—
sions for seansily olad

women and sexy moves will ssili be fulﬁlled.

Davaios agrees. “If you wans so go for the entertainment, you'll
find she enserrairiniens," he said. “But ifyou look for she message
you will ﬁnd it."

Part or she ensersainmens will be she “special rreasnienr" rhas she

The future of Emanate

Because Davaios graduases shis year, rhere is some question as so
ifand how Emanat: will continu: next fall. “It think it will be hard
for it to continue," said Davalos. “Ir will be hard for people to take it
over because shey don’t have she passion shas I have because I ssarsed
II.”

Part ofwhat many danccls love about Emanat: is that anyone
ran be a pars of is. “Everybody is welcome in Emanase," said June.
“You don'i have so have any prior experience, and chess are no audi-
(ions. l

As she founder orEmanase, Davaios believes shas rrying so main»

Williams beiieves rhas Emanare as Emanate may not work out

mosivased will sry so carry on she rradision rhas Emanase began,
"There are so rew danoe groups on campus," she said, “They can’t
