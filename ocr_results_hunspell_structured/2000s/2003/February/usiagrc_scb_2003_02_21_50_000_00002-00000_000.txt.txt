DEREK MITCHELL ‘05 left Grinnell for Kuwait yesterday when his unit of
the Arkansas National Guard was called into action. Mitchell, who told the
5&8 last week that he has doubts about war with Iraq but has a duty to
sewe his country could remain abroad for as long as two years. The Gr
Tones, the male 3 capoella group he confounded, sang “Lean on Me,"
"Stand by Me,” and ”In the Heat of the Night” in a crowded loose Lounge
at a going-away party Wednesday night . , . Triple H will battle Scott
Steiner for the WORLD WRLTILING ENTERTAINMENTCHAMPIONSHIP this
Sunday, and you're invited to 1429 Park St. to watch it. The SSA-funded
paycoer-view showing will also feature Steve Austin and ”Hollywood” Hulk
Hogan . . . Students can win one of two $25 gift certiﬁcates to the college
bookstore by visiting blockboonigrinrrelledu and ﬁlling out the BOOKSTORE
SURVEV on that site before 8 am. next Monday, Feb. 24 . . .Students can
exchange opinions about Grinnell professors online at
RATEMVPROFESSORS.COM. The website asks users to rate professors from
their Colleges on ”easiness," ”helpfulness," "clarity” and "physical
appearance.” Twenty-three Grinnell professors have currently been posted
to the site, though the mostccommentedron professor (Ira Strauber, political
science) has only been rated by six students to date . . . Enrollment at
Grinnell's branch of the IOWA VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE jumped 70
percent in the last year, from 139 to 242. The college, which collaborates
with New Horizons Alternative High School as well as offering continuing
education classes and twocyear degrees, moved in January 2002 from
downtown Grinnell to a new location on 6th Avenue West . . . Statements
of intent for SGA PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, AND SPARE are all due by
today at 5 p.rn.; the first SEA debate is Tuesday at 4:30 in the Forum.
