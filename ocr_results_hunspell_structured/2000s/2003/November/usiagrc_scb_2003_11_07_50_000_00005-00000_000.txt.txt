movie rearures rhe snuggle or. young and freespirired

rhe closed community in whieh she lives. The movie
sraris olhs a somewhar loosely eonneeied descripiion of
irs characters: rhe villagtrs’ slow rhyrhm orrheir lire,
Grozia’s manic depression, including nzked swimming,
dish smashing and orher rcmperamenral displays. her
two sons involvemenr in rhe locrl gangs, and, oreourse,
orhcr grand and perire rogmenrs ora dull isolated
collage ofllvcs. Ir srarrs ro show more coherence reward
ihe end when the morhcr and son’s conspiracy get going,
so lhaI ihc movie can he adverrised as a srory abour love.

Topkapi: typical 19605 heist movie

Bur I digress.

Much ofrhesucnng-l orrhe movie comes from Sir
perer Usrinov (knighted in 1990), who won a hen
supporring actor Oscar for his pom-dyal ofche'l'opkapi
crews bumbling, :crophobic, sweary fall guy. Given rhe

marerial, Usrmov does a preny amazing job of making
what would osuslly be a sioek choracrer compelling,
inreresring and funny.

While Do the Riga: Thing and The Phiba'zlpln'z 5w
are probably boner movies, Trp/eopi is are only sixties
heisr movie being shown at Grinneu anytime soon.
While rho special cheers osn'r compere wirh rhose or The
Matrix, np/rripi‘s dialogue doesn'r make you wince; end
while Maximlllizn schell is no Cary Gronr, Keanu
Reaves nor even a Maximillian schell.
