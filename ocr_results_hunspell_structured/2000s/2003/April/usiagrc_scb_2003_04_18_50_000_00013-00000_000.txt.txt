Anti-rant from a soon-to-be alum

I know these rants are supposed to be about how
much we hate Grinnell. But as a soonetoehe alum, I
can't help but be grateful for how wonderful things are
here. So here's a big ”thank you" to the nurses at me
health center, the building custodians, the librarians at
Burling, all the professors that wrote me recommenda-
tions for grad school every student that ever helped a
drunk stranger at Harris, and anyone that held doors
open for me when I was on crutches. The fact that we
watsh out for one another 1: what makes this campus
such a pleasant place to be. I only hope it stays that
way when I’m gone.

Granola-eating Grinnellian

What the heck? No nonsvegan granola in Quad for an
entire week? An entire week! And then they reﬁll it
on Sunday and it’s gone in 24 hours, whereupon they
add insult to injury by replacing it with some

off orgsanola. You can keep your ”Frosted Pulses,” so
chockefull of pogo-stick-inducing concentrations of
pure sugar that they are single-handedly derorestirig

started about what fun shapes those blobbish
marshmallows in your ”Lucky Charms" are supposed
to he. Bleah. I'll take my good old-fashioned, old—
schodl granola, thank you much, And for that matter,
the bananas that must without fail be mixed in with
the granola are supposed to be pure yellow, rather
