At 7:15 a,m, on any given weekday morning, earlye
rising students stumole hleaty.eyed into Quad dining hall.
For many ofthem, the only motivation for crawling outor
bed is the thought ofa smiling and cheemil Joy Douglas
handing them an order of“Eggs by Joy."

“Joy’s gteat," said Doia Khandkar '05. “She’s die only
reason i go to breakfast. she knows what I gatii usually
get two eggs scrambled—and I don’t even have to tell her.
There’s no other teason to go to breakfast unless you get
eggs to order."

glas waitressed for 16 years. Her
only previous professional experi-
ence cooking eggs was at the Via-
torian Inn in Victor, Iowa, where
she worked during high sehool.

It took awhile to get the hang
of preparing eggs. She praetieed
ﬂipping with asliee ortoast in the
skillet and latet with eggs. “My co-
workers [at Quad] ate: lot ofeggs," she slid “Every moms

but we made it."

But Douglas adds her own personal touches to her

she makes her eggs. Then a friend hought her a white

plastic ehieken, her first decoration. Little hylitrle,
she added more, including several more chick-

homey and inviting, she said.
