Flaws in
Azoulay’s
breakdown

1 am writing to take issue with professor Azotrlay's guest eohunn
“KcrryAssumes ignoranee." l was so struek by the timed and dcccp»
tive nature ofher arguments, that 1 {oh eompolled to write my first
letter to the editor. in an attempt to paint Kerry as preiudieed .ind
condescending, Azoulily first aitaeked the preratory and parcllrhcih
ed eomrrient he made before answering a question on Arrrea that his
wife was from Mozaniblquc and had been foreed to leave. Av
dove into a lengthy yet utterly hazy description of the Moeambioue
revolution and then blasted Kerry for supposedly assuming that no
body in the room would knowas mueh about the situation as Azoulay
apparently did,

The problem with her argument was that 1) it was not an argu.
mcnr; it was a history lesson, 2) The history lesson was eonstrueted
in such a way a, to highlrght

no attempt to eonneet this
apparent rneongrurty on
Kerry’s behalf to a logteal

Arriea's needs. And 4) the
argument/ history lesson
missed the point that even lfKerry’s wife was in rattan evil oppressor
orblaekAfrioans, the simple fast that she originates from Arrisa means
that for Kerry, Africa is more than just a place on a map that he tan
ignore. it is a plate he oan ignore only ifhe wants to get in a ﬁght
with his wife.

Azoulay then attacked Kerry for his response to her question can-
eerning Charlie Rangers (D-NY) proposal for a national draft. After
spending a paragraph eharaeteriaing Rangel as a right—minded war
veteran eoneerned only with the elass issues at play in the armed
services. she blasted Kerry for ratialrerng the issue through his eoin.
merits on the unfairness of foreing a higher proportion of people
from “South central, Detroit and Harlem” into war darough the
draft as opposed to Americans from other areas who were able to get
deferments. in doing so, she hinted that Kgrry’s points were elitist
and iaeist.

The problem with Atoulay's breakdown of Kerry's response is
twofold. l) Shedcscribed Rangers proposal ora national draft only
in scale-economic terms. She failed to aeknowledge that because
Rangel is a blaek man who represents Harlem, his ealls (or socio-
eoonomie justice must at least in part be viewed in raeial terms. 2)
She deserrbed Kerry's response only in raeial terms, She negleeted to
acknowledge that when he reretenees South central, Detroit and
Harlem he is eiting plates that are both predominantly blaek and
Predominantly poora Thus, he did not as she elaimed try to “evade"
the eeoiromre issue at hand in an elitist fashion. Clearly, poor Ameri—
eans everywhere have gotten the shaft in d1 editions ofotrr nations
draft but to hint that Kerrys response on this issue was elitist and
vaguely raeist is soirseiously deeeptive and in any ease wrong.

Lasdy, the toneofthe eoltrmn was unneeessarily vituperative and
ultimately unintentionally self. .satiritrng

Awulay repeatedly made note ofher distaste for people who as.

her eolumn to lengthy explanations of reeent hisrorieal events and

As the leader ofGrinnell students for Kerry. my normal response
upon seeing letters to the editor that attsek Scluml Kerry is to lo»

Senator Kerry from an inaeeuiaie attae by the Dean earnpaign
seemed to provoke epirte a reaetron in the last issue ofthe SM}. Giant

Kerry’s libenrlism and Dean's conscn'atlsm but. to paraphrase Harry
Truman, “we told the truth and the Dean eampaign thought it was
hell." The earnpaigu was so oriended by our letter that one of the
leaders or students rot Dean, seehyr Laiu, published a letter in the
5&3 attaeking Senator Kerry, Only is his attaek was that Kerry was
