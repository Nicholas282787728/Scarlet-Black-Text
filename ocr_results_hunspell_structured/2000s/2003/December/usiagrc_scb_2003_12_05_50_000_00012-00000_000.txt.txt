Association," said Hannah
Armstrong, who directs the
transfer student orientation,
”hul it would be
inappropriate for me to
enforce it.”

The administration does
not enforce transfer Student
bonding. ”We don't want
people to tetome rliouish,"
said Armstrong. Rather,
Armstrong selerts 3 group of
mentors to pair with the
transfer students. These
mentors, all transfer students
themselves, are paired with
anywhere from two to seven
students. ihey plan a plZZar

Armstrong checks up on new
transfer students via email
during the third week of the

they want to plan a group
