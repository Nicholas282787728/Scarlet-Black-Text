Flee, it moved to Quad at ﬁve, Cowles
.it sit, and was in the SGA omees by
seven. There, members of Election
Board would make their way through
as many is 5000 slips ofpipei».

“Not only was the procm tedious,
but it was extremely flowed," says cur-
rent SGA President Alejandro
Oyir-cabal '04. Off-campus students
were unable to vote and tiitnoiit lately
exceeded the 50 percent needed to pass
student initiatives.

This post Wednesday, 938 students
voted on Blackbeard. Otfe mmpus stu—
dents were able to vote. The new online
voting procedure was pioneered by then
Administrative Coordinator Oyarcabal
lastspring. The newonlinesystem was
thought a dramatic improvement on
the old system.

“With Blackboard mime the ability
to double the voting period reduee
the number orwork hours neeessary to
keep the polls open and count the bale
lots and, most importantly. make
voting eonvenient to all students,"
Oyambzl said,

This fall; under Administrative Co-
ordinator Liz Allan ‘04, Election Board
saw record highs in voter turnout. Over
85 percent ofstudenrsvoted on student
initiatives. “We’re conﬁdent now that
Blackbeard really helps enftanchiscstur
dents," says Allan, "Blackboard has
made elections stronger and more
democratic."

Remembering
Jim Randall

A Grinnell alum and beloved swim
coach dies in an automobile accident
while doing the work he loved

by Leslie Boyadjian
Staff Writer

Jim Randall graduated from Grinnell College in 1994
with a degree in Spanish, ready to take on the world. And
he stayed right here For the next eight years Randall de-
voted his he to die Grinnell College swimming program
and the Grinnell Community. Last Fnday Randall's life was
cut tragically short in a cat aecident while he was doing
what friends, colleagues and students said he did best and
loved most—helping others.

An athlete

A swimmer, runnet, and bicyclist. Randall was an ere
cellent triathlete, ranked among the best in ihe eountry. As
:i student at Grinnell, Randall ran cross country.

“He ran on every good team back in the wly 1990's"
said cross country coach Will Freeman He was a joy to
have on the squad. . .he was easy to coach."

A running injury soon sent Randall into the swim-
ming program where he eventually made his home. By his
sophomore year. Randall, who’d swam very little before
eollege, was a conferenee swimming champion.

“He was always a better swimmer." said Freeman.

Randall was also a dedjmted triathlete. Several yeais
ago Randall participated in a triarhalon in Northern Cali-
fornitt The meet didn‘t go quite as expected as he had to
otplain to his friend Audy Hamilton Physlml Edusation,
when he got back to Grinnell

“He said, ‘well, I was winning until l was on the bike
portion and then i hit a pig,” said Hamilton, laughing.
“lronirally, the triathalon is called the Pig ManTrlathalon
He kind oflaughod about it. He was very easygoing about
the accident."

A coach

“Hewas very gifted," said swimming coach Erin Hurley,
Randall's former mllezgue and friend. Hurley, who am:
to Grinnell seven ym ago, round gtmtmmfort in Randall's
presents.

“There‘s no way I obtrldhave made the tiensition with.
out Jim,” said Hurley. “Not just because he’s a Grinnell
graduate. He’s patient. rating. a good listener, accepting.
He’s pretty extraordinary He saw the best in people and
helped bring out the has! in them."

student swimmers loved Randy for his patience, his
humor, his enthusiasm and his kindness.

“l loved how at swim meets when the races got
really close he and Erin would start jumping up and down
really fast, it was like they were on little trampolines," said
Raehel sellon ‘04. “Watching that always get me pumped
up for my raccs and made me laugh."

Randalls caring showed through in his everyday ent
counters with the team as well.

“He always took the time to hear how I was doing,"
said swimmer Leah Blusiak '03. “He really cared about all
ofthe people on the team.“

Mike Miller '04 remembers Randall as a very effective
coach.

“He just always had a lot ofextiroment.“ said Miller.
“He was able to combine gctting people to work hard
with providing an opportunity to have fun at the some
time.

Randall seemed to have a way of melting practice bin
for everyone He did things in a speeiol and unique way

Martha Mnkowski 04 recalls lims love for doing cmzy
things and recalls one pisctice from last year,

“Hi: bought a bottle of Everclear, clumped it on thc
