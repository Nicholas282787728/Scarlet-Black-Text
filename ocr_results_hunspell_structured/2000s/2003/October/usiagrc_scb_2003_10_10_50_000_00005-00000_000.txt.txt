by Lola Garcia

At the end of first semester last year, over 400
studenu tookthc opportunity to tell SGA how they
reslly reel.

in o survey orrorty two questions, the students
nelded qnestioiis ranging from what they thought
were the most impottonr issues the school raced to
their views on self governnnce. Former prcsidonr
Alelaiidio oymtbal '04 wrote And organized the
survey.

The results ctr-rte in and wctc less (inn cxtraor»
dinory While .1 innge crissrios were presented, there
were no clear “hot topics" that the student body
was concerned nbollt. The most common issue
listed, the rise in the co ottuiiton, garnered only
M percent oriesponsos ‘he e—empiis budget. slcn.
hol policy and protecting eornpiitei Inbs were also
common responses. but none mniinged to Com»
mend more then ii percent orthe responses

When sslretl whet they thought orthelob SGA
wos doing, 53 percent orstudents nnsweretl “fine."

“(The survey) was the only time we've cvcr had
any decent. . opportunity to got it sense or how
thcstudcnt body fools :lmut SGA." said SGA Ptcslr
tlunr and former Administrative Coordinator, Liz
Allan '04.

After the results were tallied, [l'K‘y rcmninctl

survey and use the suits

“I rcslly need the help or the student body,"
snld Allan, "(SGA1 can’t Just be making instilnr dc-
cisions."

One or the tirst things she wants to do is get
students oduesred, “There :ch things in [the res
spouses] where people eleorlyjustdon't know,” soid
Allan.

that “e complstoont student body .usr stops us. "

Allan realizes the role she is taking on. “This is
o reslly rislcy thing." she ssid, “rm trying to get the
student body to return to SGA."Thc euirent presi—

“we [didn’t hovel an open house in September
because of the Renaissance fair." Alexander ssid.
“A lot oitime and eiiortwent into the Renaissance
rair i hope everybody will come down and have
a good time."

Allan responds to some of the student complaints

SEA is pan/211275 to 2172:! real and
important changes.

SGA alone probably is too powerless to
effect real changes. I do believe,

however, that the student body as a whole
has realinfluence. Through open dialogues
and, when necessary, direct action,
students can make changes, The problem
we have is with the apparent lack of
student interest in campus issues. If
students fail to voice opinions to SGA,
there’s no way we can formulate an
organized response to campus administra-
tors. SGA has the resources, the informas
tion and the necessary connections to
effect change. We need student support
more than anything else,

Students are apathetic and uninvolved in
SGA in part because of luck of visibility
and publicity.

This was a Common survey response, and
I'm more than happy to deal with this
concern. You should hear from your SGA
senator on a weekly basis, via the distribu-
tion of the Joint Board minutes. Because
that‘s not enough in terms of publicity,
we’re going to try some new things this
year. Before fall break, look for loggia
posters, tabling in the rnailiooin and a
letter summarizing issues for the student
body. If you have more thoughts about
publicity please contact me. As always,
Joint Board meetings are open to the
public, Wednesdays, 7:30 p.m., North
Lounge.

Self-governance is ajnke/ dead/ a last
cause/ weak/ should be abolished/ an
excuse from the college to allow students
to drink in the middle of rum! lawn.
While self-governance allows students the
freedom to actindependently and autono—
niausly, it also necessitates that we make
responsible, community-oriented decisions.
I think that self-governance will die if we
don’t make it a part of our everyday
decisions, If we believe in the philosophy
of self-governance and want it to remain
intact, we need to have some senous
discussions about what it means to this
college. I will convene some sort of a
student initiative on this topic directly
after fall break Be an the lookout for e»
mail from your senator about that.

No one takes 56A seriously.

I get the sense that this was true in the
past and may still be, I want to emphasize
that SGA is your best resource for student
group, student life and campus concerns.
While SGA handles a large budget. I think
that budgets should be a small part of
what we do, This is a representative body,

, here to act in the interests of students.

Please give us a year. Tell us what we can
do for you and how you're willing to help.
I understand that this requires a leap of
faith for some, but if you believe in the
fundamental mission of Grinnell College,
you have to trust someone on this campus
to help it along,
