House, pool of relics

For the inhabitants of 1228 1/2 Main Street, every day is a swim down memory lane

BY SAMIRA SADEQUE

The sleepy atmosphere outside of 1228 V1 Main Street,
(better known as swimmer House) is the opposite orwhat one
might expect after all the campus chatter about parties hosted
there earlier this semester. But the illusion is shattered the sec-
ond the door is opened and you are greeted With music blasting
down from upstairs and about a dozen pairs ofshoes lying like
a booby trap right in fiont of the door. Snake your way up the
winding staircase and you will be greeted by the housemates
themselvesiValcric Stimac ’09, Dan Neely ‘09 and Tommy
Olson '10.

The three teammates moved in together this fall, following
the long line of swimmers who have occupied the house be-
fore them. Although the house has a strong tie to the swimmer
community, the three friends
have been careful to make
their home a community that
is open to everyone. “There is
a notion that this house is only
for swimmers, and we want to
break that,” Stimac said. “This
year, our aim is to welcome
nontswnnmers along with the swimmers when we have parties
or movies."

Vthn not sharing their house with hordes of other Grins
nelllans, the three have to share household duties with each
other. The three swimmers are teammates in the kitchen as well
as in the pool. “Usually someone or the other is in the mood to
cook something,” said Olson.

When it comes to other chores, Neely and Olson are lucky
to have a roommate whose moods extend to some of the dirtier
jobs. “The other day I was in the mood to clean,” Stimac said,
“so i ended up eleaning the bathrooms?

“Swimmer ﬂoor plus attic"might be a more accurate name
for the residence, since the three swimmers share the house with
a professor who lives on the first ﬂoor and a tenant who lives
in the basement. The swimmer section of the house includes
three bedrooms, a kitchen, a huge attic, and another room With
a huge “GARAGE SALE" sign on the door. The room is cits
actly what the name evokes—a room ﬁill orrandoni stuff ready
to be sold off at a garage sale.

In fact, the majority of items in swimmer house look as
though they could be sold at a garage sﬂbprobas

kept in the house to uphold a sense ortradition. The

residents of the house have always made sure that

they presents even the smallest relics that have been

left behind by the previous residents. One such heirloom is a
crumpled beer can that was left in the refrigerator by a student
from the class of1982 “This house has ti character," Neely snid
proudly, showing off the beer can. “We love this placel"

But Swimmer House alums leave behind more than old
beer cans. Ouer a decade ago, students living in the house starts

out. Currently, there are about nine boards hanging up. eaeh

Apart from the boards full of pictures. the
house is decorated by a collection of old swims

swimmers touch at the end

to the students of the house.
“Our theme this year is dogs
and ducks, and you'll find many mascots of them
around," Neely said, .

The room in Swimmer House with which stu-
dents are probably most familiar is the attic. “The
attic is the place for our big social gathermgsfolt

the walls are covered in various street signs and ii-
cense plates, and in one corner theie is a huge tinfﬂc
light set. “Tli' is great for Red Light Green Light

light.

The nttic has also accumulated its fair slime of
forgotten items. There is a “refrigerator corner"i
which is a cluster otahout six refrigerators that were
abandoned by previous members of the house. Also
left behind in excess by previous residents are the
12 rugs that cover the ﬂoor and eouches in various

,es and colors.

Between stolen nitric signs, beat-up furniture,
antique beer cans, and various other relics of the
past, Summer House is not only full ofhistory. hut
