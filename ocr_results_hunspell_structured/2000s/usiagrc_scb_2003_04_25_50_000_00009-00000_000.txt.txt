l—iepburn won an Oscar for her role as Princess Ann,
which seems surprising today. Like rheAeidcmy back rhen,
people who have not seen Audrey in acrion (for instance,
in last semester’s Waltz movie, Brook/”ruin; ri/ﬁcny’s) will be
stunned by hercharnr, grace. and beauty, Somehow rhese
traits are natural to her, yer she cxpiiids on rhein in her

he and rhe rest of the country were having some prob.

a Broadway adaprarion, shows a reunion of rhe Disciples,
four James Dean fans (Sandy Dennis, Cher, Maria l—ieflin
and Kaday Bares), in rhe rown where Dean made his 1m
film, Gionr. Altman, whose more recognized films include

0: Why make a sequel to The Racquetball Hustle?
We had been talking about doing a sequel since Titular
Head 2001 Ideas ranged from Racquetball Matrix to
Racquetball Techno and so forth. When John Wray and Dave
Whltcomb brought me the music sometime around winter
break, the deal was sealed: we all loved that song.

0: Where did the idea for the sequel come from?
Dave Whitcomb and John Wray brainstormed the story, and
brought me a flexible list of ideas. We branched from there,
adding and removing things, but the idea of playing all
over campus was always a part of the movie.

0: Why did you use that song "Tunak Tunak Tun"?
Dave found the song on a to his sister gave him, ifl recall
correctly. We uscd it because it was SO catchy, and
presumably no one had heard it before, We still don't know
what the hell Daler Mehndi is saying though.

[1: How long did it take you to ﬁlm the movie?
We shot almost all of it the before sonng Break, and used
the week after for touchups, leshoots, and exterior shots.

0: Were there any funny moments when ﬁlming?
In one of the lakes when John bicycle kicks the ball, the
hall Flew quite hard and hit Dave in the throat. He was ﬁne
of course, but it was good for a laugh. (John hit the ballin
almost every take—that guy is a machine.)

We did the jumping onto the jungle gym scene in four
separate takes. 1 didn't think we (especially Dave) would be
able to shoot it that many times, and we actually got
kicked out on the last take. We were planning on getting
kicked out however, and made sure that that was the last
scene we shot.

0: What was working with President Osgood like?
We felt a bit rushed with Russell K, because we didn't want
to waste his time, The scene that he appears in is a rip off
or Zoolondcr. Osgood plays the David Bowie role. Because of
his time schedule, Osgood's scene wasn't what we originally
intended, but it ended up working just line, He knew that
we were using his image for comedic effect, and he did not
mind at all.

0: How long did it take to edit the ﬁlm?

Every shooting day, John, Dave and i would gather at the
computer to rough edit the clips together and then either
I, or the three of us would ﬁnertune the results. in all, X
estimate we spent anywhere from 30-50 solid hours editing,
including all of the painstaking lightsaber work.

[1: What equipment and programs did you use?
We filmed the movie on a miniDv camcorder and used
Adobe Premiere 6.5 to edit. Premiere is equivalent to Final
Cut Pro, the software on the Mac in the A.V. center. 50 we
really didn’t have any more equipment that the student
body in general has access to. Because we worked in my
room, we could work more, and at odd hours. We weren't
always stuck in the A.V. center.

0: Can you share your special effects secrets,
especially the lightsabers?

Like 1 have told a few people, Goagle is your best lriend.
Sophomore year i discovered a website that shows how to
”rotoscbpe” lightsabers using Adobe Photoshop. i made a
couple clips and played around with the idea of using them
in a Titular Head ﬁlm, and ﬁnally got around to it this year,
simply because it is such a slow, painstaking process.

To do it, Dave and John actually fought with sticks duct

taped to the racquets. l then imported the movie into
Photoshup and digitally drew the sabers frame by from
over each stick. it takes about 1 hour for maybe 1 or 2
seconds per lightsober (1 had to do it twice, once for John,
and once for Dave), Then, i found a website with all the
sound effects on it.

rho “coffee" that John splashes on have, is actually
water, i went in and colored it brown using a similar
technique to the one used in the lightsabers. We didn't
think it would work, but we were amazed the ﬁrst time we
watched the completed footage.

[1: How was it watching your ﬁlm at the festival?
The festival was amazing. its always been my favorite day
of the year. it felt so great to have worked that hard on
something and have what seemed like the entire campus
cheering for your effort.

lhe quality in this Titular Head was phenomenal across
the board, the best I have seen in my four years here. Both
of Adam Pcrtilla's movies were, like his movie last year,
visually stunning in quality and content. And although
honing is a Titular Head tradition, there wasn't very much
this year. Everyone made excellent films,

0: What do you think of your trophy? Where is it
on display?
rhe trophy is great. it’s goofy yet glamorous, a true symbol
of what Titular Head should be. I will treasure it forever,
maybe with a copy of the movie hidden in the bottom to
show my kids when Star Wars Episode 34 is in theaters. It’s
in my girlfriend's room, because I might lose it in mine.
