Concrete Perspectives

Concrete Perspectives is a publica
tion of academic and creative work
by the men in the Newton Correc—
tional Facility.

The Newton Prison published a
collection of Eoncrete Perspectives
several years ago. On May 18, Gnrlr
nell College will release another col-
lection, edited by Katherine Jares
'07, Robbie Dewhurst ’06, Laura
Matter ’05 and three of the correc-
tional facility’s inmates.

Five hundred to 600 copies will
be on campus and 400 to 500 will
be distributed throughout the lie
braries and prisons of Iowa,

Inmates at the correctional fa—
cility proposed the idea to Jares,
who has been teaching and editing
works at Newton for a year and
a half. “I don’t believe there are
enough Concrete ways to reward
hard work, particularly academic
or creative work, within the prison
system," said dares. ”By creating a
peer review anthology, the guys can
really feel proud of their pieces."

Jares said that those who didn't
make it into the publication have
set up small editorial groups to go

 

The Sequence

After many comics were rejected
from the 5&5 for the fall semester,
Bradley lvcrsontong '05 felt the
need For a publication devoted to
comics, and started The Sequence.
”I started it up because all my
life, I’ve been a big comic fan,"
he said.

Sarah Mirk ’08 serves as assisV
taut editor. The second Sequence
of the semester was published last
Friday, April 29.

"r was really happy [that] this
time I was able to do more re-
search into the history of comics
at Grinnell,” said Iverson.

He explained that he thought
the new issue was nice because it
contained several return artists,
but they also had the space to put
out some new Students Work.

"We are a temporary publication,
so it is not certain that we will be
back next year, but it’s important
to me and I want it to continue
on" said lverson»tong. "It’s a good
chance for student art to get into
student hands, and we let people
get paid to do ita. Ithink it is
one or the most runiobs you can
have."

 

 

over their pieces on their own.

 

 

Zoom Art,

 

Zoom Art has been published once this semester, and a second edition is
up and coming. Peter Clough '05, is the lead editor for the project.

The last issue included works mostly from the residents of cleveland Pit,
along with a handful of other South Campus residents. ”We are trying to get
more people to submit work this time," said Joe McNertney '07.

Zoom Art accepts any visual art and the last issue included paintings,
pencil work, and photographs. Sophomore Ross Stutzman certainly thinks
it’s important. ”Zoom Art is crucial to the residential life experience, more
so than study breaks and even the dining hall plau,”he said.

Chang ‘05, “Tin Sequrmr has an appeal on compile
that gives it .1 shot as a permanent publication ifyou
give it ﬁve semesters or so."

Chang also explained that SPARC turned down
funding for oz News, a publication which summae
rized events in the news for students on campus. He
said that the committee began to have doubts about
whether E2 Nader ﬁlled a necessary niche on cam-
pus. Steve Ford '05, another SPARC member, noted
that oz News was expensive, costing around 51500
a semester, and that it failed to ﬁll a role not «or
compllshcd by onllne news emails and similar news
forums,

Chang agreed “Ir didnr feel like EZ News was
spending the money well enough for student pur
poses, and SPARC realized that the publication had
been around for a while but hndnt really done any-
rhing innovative," hc said.

The reallocation offunds allowed the funding of
a larger number of temporary publications. Chang
also poinrcd out that the group of publications and
people involved may have widened from the cliques
of the past few years."

it would be nice ifsrudenls knew where their monr
