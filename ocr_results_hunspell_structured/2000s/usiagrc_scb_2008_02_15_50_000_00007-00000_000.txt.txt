Burling show of Chicano prints brings
artistic and political messages

Graphic art from East LA. will ”hit you with color” and expand cultural horizons

nv MARIO MACl'As

All the way from East Los Angeles, Chit
cano art is now on
display in the Butt
ling Gallery. Tl)!

Stamp of sky-Help
carp/airs, a collect
tion of 50 graphic
prints, aims to ex-
pand the viewer‘s
awareness of Chicano culture.

Chris Gaunt, Library Assrstant, walked
into the gallery as Graciela Guzman ’11 set
the works up on the walls. “Wow,”Gaunt said,
“this is bound to be one ofthe best exhibitions
ever—and we've had some amazing ones down
here.”

The works presented in this exhibition
were culled from the ﬁrst 47 ateliers of Self»
Help Graphics and Art Inc., a corurrrrrnity arts
center In East LA. dedicated to the creation of
art that reﬂects the cultural spirit of the Chit
cano community. The artists and issues these
works represent vary from print to print.

Due to weather, the exhibition arrived a
few days late, but Kay Wilson, Curator of the
Grinnell College art collection, will try to ex-
tend the exhibition.

“1 love it," Wilson said “It is exactly what
the bitter cold of Iowa needs. The color is so
explosive, bur on a closer look there is an un-

give a talk
on March

p. m, about
the in-
ﬂuence of Chicano irnagery on his work. He
suggested the idea for a Chicano art exhibit
to Wilson.

“It is important to expose [Grinnellians]
to all kinds or art," Zamora said. “especially
to learn about this underrep-
resented culture that is being
depicted by artists that even
people from LA, have not
been etposed to."

As an art major and a self—
identiﬁed Chicano, Zamora
appreciates “art or the op
pressed" and sees a wonder to
this art that “is not just found
in museums." He believes that
the artist matters in order to
understand where his or‘her
art comes from, why it was created and what
the social-cultural contexts ofsnch art are.

Not everyone can grasp or relate to Lawrence
Colacion‘s Vctrrnno, which displays its subiccr

less they know about the culture rr pervades
Zamora has noticed that his own artwork
shares much or this Chicano imagery, such as
his use of skulls and Catholic symbolism.

Chicano art, usually charged with politi»
cal and religious . ociauons, speaks about the
struggle that minorities continue to face to this
day.

For example, the scrigraph by lsabel Mar-
tinez titled “V. G. got hel green card” uses
both political and religrous images to deliver a
poignant, satirical
and even humor-
ous stunt-e on rlm’

Nice to meet
you, ARTRA

Art Club b'egins second
semester with fresh
ideas to brighten cam—
pus for everyone

BYALI SARGENT

ARTRA: you’ve heard the name and spent
a few seconds wondering what it is that they
do. Well, be confused no longerl

The recently formed art club’s name comes
from the word “art" spelled forwards and backs
wards,co-founder Sadish Dhakal'll explained.
“It’s not an acronym, it’s just ARTRA." .

Dhakal and Tianhan 0.10 '11, both first-
years, started the club during their first few
weeks at Grinnell. Dhakal, who has considered
art as a possible major, was inspired when he
couldn't get into any art classes.

“There were no arr clubs here so we just
decided to do it," Dhakal said, “The purpose
of the club is to have fun. Art is the Way to
have fun.”

in an environment full of tests, readings
and papers, random art projects are certainly
enjoyable, especially for the students who don't
usually dabble in the arts. “1 like that they
are very dedicated to engaging people's cret
alivityTregatdless orwhcther they are an art
major or not," said Trlly Woodwrrrd, curator of
Academic and Public Outreach.

Almost every member of the club is an
artist of some
kind, and they
meet once a week
to bounce ideas
around, watch
YouTube videos,
listen to music
and talk about GIL
The club is sort of
a (hlnkttank for
artistic endeavors.
“We just support
each other,” said
Dhakal,“Someone
has an idea, we work on it, talk to people, and
get it done."

And ARTRA has been getting things
done. Last semester they installed a piece on
the third ﬂoor ofARH entitled “Giving Back"
for the Eioneers conference. The club col»
lecred aluminum cans from all over campus
and arranged them in a frame to Cteate a giant
wall of cans that could be removed individu-
ally, leaving holcs iu the wall until the wall colt
lapsed entirely.

“We wanted to represent the environment
and how ityou extract resources without my
cling the cnvrronmcnt is going to deteriorate,"
said Dhaka].

“I thought it wes a great project," said
Vl’oodward, who helped ARTRA through the
process orcrearing and installing the piece.

Woodward also assisted with last semester’s
“Chalk and Walk."The group provided colors
ful chalks and pastels so that passersby could
engage in some stress-relief coloring. “It was
so much fun, and we're planning on doing it
again this semester,” said Dhakdl.

other projects on the ARTRA agenda are
a video project, which will also incorporate
drawings and photography, and hopefully in
ExCo class called “Art with ARTRA."

This semester, the small but dynamic club
is eager for new members and more creative
input. “two had other members with just as
much energy, we could do so much more,"said
Dhakal. “People don't realize when they prrt so
much effort into something and it ﬁnally takes
shape it's so wonderful,"

ARTRA meets every Saturday from 4-5 in
JRC 202,

”There were no on
dubs here so we just
derided to do it. The
purpose of the dub is
to have fun. Art is the .

wayto have fun,”
Sadish Dhakal ‘11
