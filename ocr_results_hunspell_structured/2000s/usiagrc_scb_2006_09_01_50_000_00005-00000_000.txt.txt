First-years get GOOP-y

BY PAT CALDWELL

Even in rcmotc Wisconsin, Grinncllians
complain about food. Fifteen of the 20 first»
years who attended Grinncll Outdoor Orien—
tation Program (GOOP) made speciﬁc refer—
ences to the horrible quality of the food and
the inordinate amount of American cheese
provided on rhc trip,

But this was where the complaints ape
pearcd to end. The program, a ﬁve day wildcrr
ness trip, began a week before New Student
Orientation and started with a day oflearning
the basics ofoutdoor life and first aid.

The next day the 20 students, divided into
four groups of five, set out for Wisconsin with
a student leader and an assistant leader who
attended the program last year, both of whom
were Grinnell students.

According to David Zeiss, GORP coordi-
nator, the program filled up three weeks prior
to NSO. It is funded primarily by N50 and
planned through GORP, and was designed to
give incoming students an opportunity to get
to know other students before the start of the
school year and to learn about Grinnell from
the upper classmen on the trip.

Samantha Worzalla '07, one of the student
leaders said “[Flrstryears were] getting to know
people before school starts and bundling]
confidence." Worzalla said the trip helped
first-years build new friendships at Grinnell
once the school year started.

Zeiss, who did not go on the trip, agreed
with Worzalla’s assessment, saying he saw a
“night and day difference" in the ﬁrst-years
conﬁdence between when they left and re—
turned.

The trip also increased the ﬁrst-years’feela
ings of comfort once rhcy were on campus.
Ross Preston ’10, who went on the trip, said,
“[I] saw someone I knew everywhere I went
[on campusl"

This level of conﬁdence and comfort al—
lowed the students to adjust, even though they

arrived after the first NSO activities had end-

portunities to meet people, and because there
were no roommates on the trip, everyone had
at least one person to meet their ﬁrst night
