Anikn Manzoot: Who came up with the idea to do the dance
and why?

jill Peterson: I rhink it was my idea initially but Kevin jumped
on board pretty quickly. It was actually one or the first things
we decided after we got engaged. And I've been dancing most
of my life] did, actually, a lot of dance and choreography at
Grinnell. And so I knew it was something I wantcd to do be
cause it was sort oflike you're putting on a show for your family
and friends and it’s a celebration for your love and that you’re
coming together and I thought it would be a ﬁin way to do
it. And a lot of my friends were dancers and I knew that they
would go for it. Two ofthem were in dance troupe with me at
Grinnellithc first two women that came down the aisle.

' Mniiznon Why the song “Forever" by Chris Brown?

Peterson: we chose that song right when we got engaged7
so about a year before we did the weddingﬁlnd,

I mean, I love the songil thought the lyrics were

perfect. I knew it wouldn‘t offend anyone. And

then when the incident happened between him '

and Rihanna we were going to push the song, but

it sort of happened at the last minute and we didn’t

figure it out, so it’s ironic now. We ﬁgured ﬁt was

still a good song].

Manzoor: How much was choreography and how ‘
much was improvisation? Did you do any extensive
rehearsal?

Peterson:We didn’t. We actually had a onerhout rehearsal the
Thursday before the wedding and we ran through it once on
Friday at the real rehearsal. so most orit was improvd or on the
ﬂy. People soit ofhad general ideas ofwhat they were supposed
to do and we had a woman at the door cueing people when they
were supposed to go in [laughs]. But other than that, a lot of
people were making it up as they went.

Manzoor: How many people knew about the plan beforehand
and how did they feel about it?

Peterson: Our parents found out the Friday before that we were
doing it and our pastoriwho is a relative of ours—l told her
we were doing it and it was ‘okay with her. But other than that
no one really knew. They were really supportive, they thought it
was a run ideal mean, they know us pretty wen. so... [laughs].

Manzoor: orthose who weren't expecting it, who had thc best
reaction? How did the older folks react to it,>

Peterson: It was amazing. Actually, it was something I was a
little bit concerned about—if anyone was going to be offends
ed or think it was too nontraditional. But really nobody was.
Everybody was completely enthusiastic and we had people in
their, you know, 805 coming up and saying, “If we had done
our wedding 50 years later, we would have done something like
that." And on the way out of the church, Kevin’s grandmother
and my grandmother both danced on the way out, which was
just so cute.

Manzoorz What do you think happened to make it so popular?
Peterson: You know it's something that I've been thinking

about a lot and,..it was astounding what happened. I mean,we
put it up thinking our friends would look at it and maybe for

Juli:

we;

;a. "iii/ii i’i'i
ward it to a few friends and we wanted the family to see it who
couldn’t make the weddingl didn’t know something was going
to happen, I didn't even know what the definition ofa “viral
video" was! And it went like wildﬁre.I mean, it happened barely
within about three days after we posted it, it ms so
quick. I don’t know what it was. I don’t know ifit
was a slow news week or if there’s something about
the video that’s just pure joy and happiness that
people seem to really grab onto. Or if it was just
sort of rough times and people wanted something
~, positive and happy. And I think also it was because
it spread around the entire world so quickly and it
, got really big in Europe and Asial thinkit was be
cause dance is really an international language, that
it was able to go worldwide. But yeah, it’s totally
bizarre to me,I don’t know!

Manzoor: How did you react when it became ofvii'al status?

Peterson: We were sort of checking on it every day to see, be-
cause we saw it spreading to people really fast. And then when
it wasn't even a million hits was when “The Today Show” called
Kevin and was like, “Do you guys want to come on ‘The Today
Show’in New York City?”And we were just like, “What are you
talking about?l"l mean we thought...we were laughing—we
_thoughr it was so crazy and we were calling all our friends. I
mean, it was ienlly nuts: And then we started getting tons of
media calls,l would say, on days three and four.

Manzoorz How does it feel being internet celebs? What is the
best and worst thing?

Petersontl mean,,.it's fun. I would say the best thing was that
we had gotten this website where people can donate to the
Sheila Wellstone Foundation for Domestic Violence. And also
we put an e-mail address up there so people can shoot us an e-
mail it they want to. And after this morning I think we’ve got
ten around foul thousand e-mails. And they're amazing. And
they're from people all over the world that tell you these stories
about their lives or what this video has done for them or how
often they watch it. And that hasjust been really touching and
amazing, just reading all these stories from people.

The worst part was probably that it happened right before
Kevin was starting law school and I was going take my cum,
prehcnsive exam for my PhD. [laughs] so the timing was not
great!

Manzoor: Were ou passionate about this cause [domestic vio-
lence prevention]y before deciding to spread the Word about the
foundation?

Peterson: I mean, I study violence, specifically mental illness

and violence, but also general violence prevention and inter
vention. So it was a really important issue to me. And after
we sort or shot Chris Brown's song up in the charts—1 don't
know how high it got,l.ike~’4 or 5 or somethingiwe’ve started-
being rcally uncomfortable with it, especially with everything
that had been going on.

We thought it was a really nice opportunlryiwith all these
people feeling all this positive emotion and reaching out to
usito just ask people to be able to raise money for a cause.
And we picked the Sheila Wellstone Institute for Domestic
Violence Prevention because of the domestic violence con-
nection, because it was local and also because they did sort of
bigger policy-level work on a national level. And yeah, the re—
sponse has been amazing for that too. I haven't actually heard
from them in a few weeks but the last I heard I think we had
raised around $20,000 or 50.1 think to be able to direct all the
attention we were getting towards something like that and dc»
ﬂect it from ourselves a little bltilr felt good for us to do that.

Manzoor: The video was uploaded onto YouTube around July.
Is the response to it as overwhelming as it was before?

‘Pcterson: No, it’s calmed down a 10!. Before it was like we

were [getting contacted] every couple of minutes from differ
ent people, and it’s deﬁnitely calmer now. Although it's shock-
ingly still going on [laughs].1 didn't think it would be! We're
still getting phone calls from people who want interviews and
things Like that.

Manzoor: How many times were you asked to re—enact the
dance?

Peterson:l have had professors and things ask me to dance
into the room oi dance out of the room [laughs] but a tormal
request for the full thing was pretty rare.

Manzoorthat is your fondest memory ofGr'mnell?

Peterson: Oh my gosh! That is tough. Well, in terms ofdance,
my senior year, Barbi [Rodriguez '03] and IiBarbi who was
in the pieceiput together an independent study that was like
dance in the form of social movement. And for that class we
got to choreograph an antiwar dance—it was right when the
Iraq War broke out our senior year. And so we had 40 Grinnel-
lians who learned the dance to protest the war and we went and
performed it on rhe state capitol in Des Moines and in Iowa
City in the mall and we performed it in the paik in Grinnell
and it was just an amazing experience. And ir was one of
those “only at Grinnell" experiences, you know? [laughs] Very
Grinnell. Like,you tell other people about that and they're like,
"And you got credit for that?"lt was amazing.
