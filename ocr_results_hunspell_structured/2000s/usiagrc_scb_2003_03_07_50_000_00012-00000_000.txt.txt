fourth Beetle to win a Grammy for his solo work was John Lennon.

it wasn't until 1994 that the British government acknowledged the existence oi
M16, the CIA-like institution for which James Bond would have worked. The
covert intelligence agency was as years old at the time, (And Mick Jagger was

53.)

The James Bond film franchise has spawned more seguels than any other: Die
Another Day was James Bond's 20m movie. That is, unless you count the two
installments released without the permission oi United Artistsifaslno hbyole,
a 1957 parody starring David Niven, and Never Say Never/190m, Sean Tonnery's

abortive 1932 return to the role (at age 53).

"Never say Never when it came to hnding your iamrly somewhere out there in
19th~century New York City? That was the voice of Christopher Plummer, aka.
Captain Von Tram). Plummet also narrated Nickelodeun': 1985 series ”David the

A pidgin language is one that arises irom makeshift communication between
people who don't share a common native tongue. its votabulany and grammar
tend to be prohibitively simple. itchildren are raised in a community thatspeaks
a pidgin language, however. they will naturally develop a full set or linguistic
rules, treating what linguists tall a creole, Haitians speak a language called

Creole, a creole which evolved from an old rrench pidgin.

in the United States, “Creole" has also come to refer to Louisianans oi rrench or
Spanish descent. The adyective is sometimes coniused with "Cayuo," because of
geographic and culinary ties between the cultures. Cajuns are descended fruln a
group of French settlers expelled from Nova 5cotia by the brrtish in 1755,- many

uflhem settled In Louisiana.

The tlight or the cajuns from canada to louisiana was commemorated by Henry
Wadsworth longrellow in his epic poem tvongeline The title character, an exiled
raiun, searches across the United States for her lost lover Gabriel, Some Cajuns
see the poem as patronizing, and commemorate it in a iolk sung: "dohncl, rl
etoitpbs beou / Evangeline no so valort pos niieux' (”Gabriel i-rasn't gouddnnklng

/ Evangeline wasn't any better').

longfellow's verse is distinctive when read aloud because it uses highly stylized
rhythm, lie wrote Evugeline in dactylic hexameter, which is most famous as the
rhythm pattern of homers Iliad and Odyssey, because that rhythm tends to
sound unnatural in English, translators or Homer have employed a variety or
driierent.versrfications, irorn Pope's heroic couplets to thapman's iambic
