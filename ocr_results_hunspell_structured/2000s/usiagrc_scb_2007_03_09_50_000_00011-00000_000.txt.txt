season with high expectations

av NATE LINDSEY

Arrcr regularly being picked to finish in the MWC cellar
in preseason coaches' polls over the years, the Pioneer softball
team has ﬁnally earned some respectiand higher expectations
When the season begins over spring Break, the team will be
aiming for a conference championship after returning almost
every key player from a team that ﬁnished second in the confer
ence last season.

The Pioneers lost just one starter to graduation in Karyn
Wieland '05; who was third on the team in batting average at
.342 and led the tealn in runs scored (31) and total bases (59).
Returning starters include Darcy Ward ’09, who led the team in
barring average (.455), runs (25), hits (53), triples (5), R131 (30)
and stolen bases (13)

Pioneers look forward to
warmer weather and bet-

The men's and women's indoor track teams
both finished in the middle of the pack last
weekend at the MWC Championships, with
the men placing fifth and the women finishing
sixth, There were some notable performances
in the shoitei distance and ﬁeld events,but the
distance teams did most ofthe scoring for the
Pioneers.

The men's only ﬁrst place finish came
in the distance medley relay, where Tommie
Jamison 0’9 Charlie Knuth ’0,8 Nick Merkliri
'08 and Drake Ballcw 08 ﬁnished' in 10: 34 76
13 seconds ahead of the secondeplace (Cam,

Sarah Spencer '08 led the women by set~
ting new school and meet records in both the
5k and 3k. Her 17:36.88 performance in the
5k was more than a minute faster than second

place finisher, fellow Pioneer Katie Ryan '07.

Another Grinnell distance runnei, Becky
Bessinger '09, ﬁnished second to Spencer in
the 3k. Spencer ran a 10:12.36, while Besse
inger turned in a 10:52.12.

When asked about her dominating perfor-
mance. the softrspoken Spencer simply said, “I
have a great team to main with and really sup—
portive coaches”

Bessinger'09 also earned points in the once
mile rim, where she placed fourth with a time

of 5:29.34.

“We were quite satisfied with how we did
at the indoor track meet," coach Evelyn Freer
man said of the women's team, “Virtually cw
eryone who competed had their seasonal or
lifetime bests."

The men shared in some of the distance
event success, with David Montgomery '10
placing third in the 5k with a time of15:18.60.
Knuth, Jamison and Nick Sparr ’09 ﬁnished
fourth through sixth in the one-mile run with
times of 4:31.02, 4:3191 and 4:37.28, rcsche
rively.

Both teams look to ﬁeld a more competi-
tive outdoor season squad, in part due to the
ability to train on the outdoor track in milder
weather, and also because Grinnell’s long wine
ter breakleaves just “two weeks ofrraining bee .
fore our first [indoor] meet,” Freeman said.

Because the other conference teams have
the advantage ofmore preparation time in lane
uary, the Pioneers “look at [the indoor season]
as preparation for the outdoor season,” Free—
man said

Spencer is looking forward to warmer
weather, which will allow her to train for the
outdoor distance events without the boredom
of having to run 25 times around [a 200m]
track "

The outdoor season gets underway dur-
ing spring break, when both teams travel to
Florida to compete in the Disney World Inc
vitational and the Embry Riddle Aeronautical
University Relays.

Grinnell received just one vote for first place in the preseason
coaches' poll. The Foresters, who lost arguably their top hitter
and best pitcher in addition to their head coach, received eight
of the 10 ﬁrsteplace votes.

coach Tom sonnichscn believes being picked so high in
the preseason poll will not add any extra pressure to his team.
He said that he cares more about where the Pioneers are at
the end of the season than where they are projected to be right
now.

He did, however, acknowledge that the preseason polls can
make an impact.“Being picked second is as much an advantage
psychologically as anything else," Sonnichsen said.

The biggest question mark heading into the season is at
catcher, where two new faces, Chloe Moryl ’10 and Julia Reese
’10, will split time eaily in the season.

“All their basic skills are very good. [They have] good in
stincts, and [have been] wellrcoachcd to this point," Sonnichsen
said. “What they have to do quickly is to learn how to manage
the game and the pitching staff."

To assist the young catchers, Annie Beaman ’05, a former
Midwest Conference all South player. will be volunteering her
expertise to help ease the transition Moiyl said that she and
Reese have been working hard to learn all ofthe signs and learn
about their pitchers.

‘Catching is a huge responsibility, Moryl said You are es-
senrially the general on the field, which is an intimidating place
to be, especially as a freshman."

Sonnichscn is sure that no matter who gets the starting role,
both players will have the opportunity to support their team
due to their bat and haseerunning skills.

“Every girl on the team has amazing talent," Reese said.
“I’m really lucky that I’ll get to start on the ﬁeld with them as a
firstryear. We are a cohesive team and all passionate about the
sport, which makes the game fun to play." .

Grinneu will begin their season in Arizona at the Tuscan
Invitational Tournament on Mar. 18. The Pioneers will play
eight games in five days, including several rough teams from
around the nation.

“The players have not been able to get outside and play and
practice, but they are ready to get into the warm weather and
sit by the pool,” Sonnichsen said. “When they get on the dine
mond, though, they aie pretty focused. [They have] great killer
instinct, which is what I like in a team."

Glinnell's ﬁrst home game is scheduled for Mar. 3061
when they host the Grinnell Invitational Tournament. The
Pioneers will play Northwestern College (1a.) and UW~La
Cl‘osse.

Pinging bats ring in springtime as baseball team logs blowout wins

Every year, the sounds of gloves popping and bats cracking

The blowout wins lend support to this year's MWC pre-
season coaches" poll. Last season, the Pioncers ﬁnished third
after the poll picked them last. This year, the coaches placed
them in a threesway tie for ﬁrst in the Southern division with
Monmouth College and Illinois College.

as well. Grinncll pounded out 25 luts for 27 runs in two games
