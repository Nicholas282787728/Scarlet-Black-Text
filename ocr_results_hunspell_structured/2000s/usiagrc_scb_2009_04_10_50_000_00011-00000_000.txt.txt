He dcsi is the clock after his only son _ '

leaves to fight in World “hr 1, but before the
clocks completion, he receives news ofhis son's
death. When the clock is finall v unveiled, it
runs in reverse. Gateuu’s explanation: he hoped
that time could bring his on back to him, It's
a sad opening that effectively sets the tone for
the film.

Obviously, there’s something profoundly
sad and lonely about Benjamin's circumstances.
As a baby he looks like an old (albeit infant-
sized) wrinkled man ofSO. His mother dies in
childbirth and his father, horriﬁed at Benjamin’s
appearance, abandons him in front of a nurs
ing home, run by the spirited Qrcenie (Taraji P.
Henson). Henson earned an Oscar nomination
for her role here, largely because she transcends
the stereotype that her role could have become
by infusing it with warmrh and heart.

It becomes quickly apparent that Benjamin
ism fact getting younger as time passes, and he
has to endure his friends in the nursing home
dying around him. The film makes the heavy-
handed link in these early moments between
old age and infancyﬂt these points in our lives
we are dependent, needy. and fragile. Heavys
handed: yes. Heartfelt: also yes.

Screenwriter Eric Roth is known for the
similarly epic fable “Forrest Gump," and the
two ﬁlms share a central conceit of a journey
man searching for himself as rhe years pass.
Pitt’s performance seems largely impassivc, but
his work is quite complex beneath the surface.
Benjamin retains a childlike naiveté and wills
ingness to really live life. not letting it pass him
by, and Pitt is in full control of both of these
endearing qualities.

He is helped not only by the amazing makes
up and special effects that allow him to eerily
age backward (seeing Pitt in his 20s and 30s is
remarkable and jarring) but by the luminous
Blanchett. Roth made it diﬂicult for Jenny and
Forrest to be together in “Forrest Gump." and
Daisy and Benjamin have hurdles of their own,
Except for a few blissful years spent together in
rheir 40s, the two will never be the same age.
Benjamin knows this and makes the difficult
decision to leave Daisy after they have a child
together, believing that their daughter “deserves
a father, not a playmate,”

Many years later. an elderly Daisy receives
a phone call from an awkward and confused

an old gnmdmorher-type, cares for the love of
her life as he goes from awkvwrrd preteen, to
toddler, to infant.

Earlier in the film, Benjamin says, “I will
go out ofthis world the same way l came inm
alone.” We all do, but not all of us have mans
aged to 1ch such an extraordinary life, While
this film is overlong and can be heavy-handed,
it is also beautiful and touching. “The Curious
Case ofBenjamin Button"is quite a journey.

Blaxpoitation and Kung Fu

Did Ijust watch the most stereotypical cult
classic of all time? It sounds weird to have that
idea bouncing around your head. “The Last
Dragon" is a fine movie, but I look back on it
thinking more aboutjust how stmightt'orward it
all seems, and how weird that feels for a movie
that is supposed to defy Cinematic norms by be—
ing utterly ridiculous. Allow me to elaborate,
using a hastily composed list of “Cult Classic
Requirements."

It You will be both impressed and awe-
struck at the stupidity ofth: concepts

The movie starts with the Bruce Lee
inspired Leroy Green (Taimak) finishing his
kung fu training in a dojo located on the Man-
hattan side of the East River. He can only reach
the final level by achieLing the “glow," literally

Meanwhile, Laura Charles (Vanity) hosts
an NlTV-esque music video extravaganza, but
runs into trouble thanks to Eddie Arkadian
(Chris Mumey), who tries to kidnap Laura so
she’ll play the music video ofhis Cyndi Lauper
wannabe girlfriend, Angela, Like every kung fu
movie, Leroy steps in just in time to save her,
only to disappear after she turns around, leading
to contrived romantic tension,

The movie is tied together through Greens
only adversary, Sho'NuEf, the immaculately
dressed Shogun of Harlem (Julius J- Carry III)
who is by far the standout character of the mow
ic. Eddie hires out the Shogun to find Laura.

To put it bluntly, the ’80s are a godsend to
“The Last Dragon." Musically, we get an over-
the-top kung fu montage in the opening credits
made even better with synthesizers. a shameless
ripoff of “You’re The Best" from “The Karate
Kid," and an acrual decent song in “Rhythm of
the Night.” Director Michael Schultz also liens

3. I end up quoting a specific line that 1
will enjoy referencing for at least a week

“Am I the baddest mo fo, low down around
rhis town? Sho'Nuffl" The only thing more
satisfying is learning that Samuel L. Jackson
will play him in the upcoming remake. I’m
dead serious

4. A few diameters will bring down the
movie, depriving it ofanyone but a“cult" aur
dience since it’s not really that spectacular.

In this case, white people ruin cveryrlu g.
Eddie's subplot does nothing to interest w-
ers that have already been amused by excepe
rional ﬁght scenes, the idea ofa kung fu culture
in Harlem, and the exploits of Letoy’s father
running his pizza parlor.

it seems like the writers had to decide bcr
tween plugging the inevitable gaping plot holes
or another couple of scenes with the criminally
underused Sho'Nuff, and honestly thought the
former made for a better movie. You just shake
your head and wonder what could have been.

5L On the whole, it will be so bad that it‘s
good.

I mean, come on, how can you keep your
self from laughing when Sho’nuPE announces
he will kill Leroy with the proclamation that
he “will designate his ass for dismemberment?"
or when Leroy discusses sex as an art form?

The requisite srup'rd, yet inventive dialogue
from an off-beat set of characters in a crazy set~
tingis the cornerstone ofany great cultsclassic.
But with the cult canon now bursting with
equally ridiculous films, it's a shame that “The
Last Dragon" gets too sidetracked to dismnce
itself from its counterparts and be anything
more than straightforward absurdity
