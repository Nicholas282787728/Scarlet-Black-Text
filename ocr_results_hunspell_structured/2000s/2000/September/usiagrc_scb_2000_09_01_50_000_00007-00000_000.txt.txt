Every sport has irs legacy ream.
In baseball it’s the Yankees, whose
20 World Series championships in
40 years guaranreed rhe ream :tnd
irs srars a spot in hisrory.

in hockey ir’s rhe Canadians.
whose nnmi: appears on the Stanley
Cup more rhan any orher reams.

In Midwest Conference men’s
cross counrry, ir's rhe Pioneers, who
have won 13 oftl-ic last 14 MWC
titles (missing the crown only in
1996) and 16 rirles roral since
orinuell ,oined rhe conference in
1940.

Since rhe (cam graduared only
one orirs top ﬁve runncrs lasr year,
rhere is no sign rhar rhc legacy will
and in the 2000 season. Both rune
ners and coaches have high hopes
that the Plonccrs will hold onto the
bow crown and surpass rheir per.
formance in last year's NCAADi.
vision III regional meet.

“we fully cspecr ro win confcre
enee rhis year Our main goal is ro
qualify for narionals, and we are
uniﬁed in achieving that goal,"
Noah Lawrence ‘02 said.

Head coach Will Freeman ech-
oed Lawrence's optimism.

“We're orerry cxeircd abour rhe
year. It’s going ro he prerry posie

rive," Freeman said,
Much orrhe positive this year
is likely ro come rrom rhe top rhree

-rerurning Purple Roos (the unorn.

cial nickname rho ream has raken
over rhe years): John Aerni ’01, Rob
Park '01 and Lawrence. All rhree
made rhe all-conference ream lasr
year and were elocred as captains
this year.

“It's nor often rhar our top run:
ners happen ro be all our captains,"
Freeman said, “but rhr rearn vored
rhem as csprains. l rhink it’s be-
cause oirheir work erhic.

“[Thc Captalns] are every
eoachs dream. They are dedieared,
verydisciplined and lead in rhe hesr
possible way...by example,” Frec-
man said in a reeenr press release
shcur rhe rearn.

The capraios won't have ro do
all rhe work to carry on rhe legacy
rlus year, rhough. A srrong group
or 13 reeruirs has added a level or
drprh ro the ream rhar was misse
ing iasr year and hrings rhe ream
to 27 runners.

”Unlike rhe past few years, this
ream has depth,” Lawrencesaid. “If
one oflh: top runners goes down,
there Will be someone ro come up
and rake his oiaee "

Freeman said rhar he doesn’t
wanr ro push rhe new runners too

hard, rhough, and prefers ro give
rhem rime ro adapt ro Grinncll
rheir ﬁrst year.

“IFwe go rrue ro form, well use
rhar freshman year as an adap»
rarion year re Grinnell,” he
said.

Freeman and the ream dc.
cided ro ease up on rhe sched-
ule as well: rhe ream will race
only every other weekend rhis
year in an errorr ro extend rheir
legacy beyond rhe MWC and
our in rhe regional and narional
level.

"we rhoughr we mighr have
overetaced lasr year, possibly
overrrained ar rhe end," Free»
man said. “We were strong
enough ro win rhe conference
pretty Comfortably, bur rhen ar
the regional meer we just ran
tired."

The schedule

means rhe pioneers won'r begin

reduced

rheir season unrii Sept. 16
when rhey hosr over 20 teams
from ﬁve srares ar rhe 37th an.
nual Les Duke lnvirarional.

Though rhe invire isn't for
several weeks, Freeman is al.
ready optimistic abour his
rcam's chances for the season.

“The rurure looks pretty
bright,” he said.

“I think rhar rhe reams abiliry ro play

Regardless of whar combinarien or six

rhar rhe ream should be ar leasr as srrong as

“As every praeriee eonnnues, w: gor a

The team's ﬁrst chance ro look or rhar
