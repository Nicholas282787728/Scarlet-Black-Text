Ready to ruck: Griffins, Harpies start new season

by Nicholas Johnson
Spor‘ls Editor

The ofﬁcial family weekend calendar of even ts for last Sate
utday listed six home sporting matehes students kitli rind kin
might be interested in attending: two cross country rntais, iwo
soeeer matches, a volleyball game and a football game.

While all of these events gave visitors a good taste of the
kind ofthtills typical orGrinnell athleties, it was the two games
that were not on the talendar that provided arguably the most
action to onlookers on Saturday 7 both the men's and women's
club rugby teams played matches in the midst or the family
weekend goingson.

Rugby has long been an institution at Grinnell even though
it has never been a varsity sport, it’s long life eomes is no stir.
prise to members or the Griffins (men's team) and Harpies
(women's team), though.

Grimn Erik Anderson ’01, said that rugby appeals to him
betaust oi the variety ofways players need to use tlrtir'bodios
and minds in the game. “There's contact 7 it's .t full body thing
You needenduranee; you gotta be rasr, you gotta bestrong, you
gotta be smart," hesaid. “I can have 30 serends orglory and 20
minutes of mediocrity and it's all good for me."

For Harpies eo-eaptain Alison Mikulytik ’02, the appeal of
rugby is almost limitless, “Rugby is an amt-ring, empoweiing
activity," shesaid. “The eonhdente one gains in the capabilities
and Strengths ofone’s body is unparalleled in any other sport.”

Fellow Harpie Ruthie Anderson '03, said the best part of
rugby is that the sport is just plain fun,

“Rugby is just all around a lot of fun it’s totally a team
sport. The intensity or it makes it a lot ofriin, and, oreoiitse,
the attual game is only part orplaying rugby."

The other part orrugby that Ruthie Anderson alludes to is
the culture that surrounds the sport. \Vhile the game itselflooks
to ﬁi’SFtlmc spectators like a mix ofAmcriean football and sacs
eer (see the Rugby Basies graphic for more information), there
is no mistaking the not the rugby culture is something all its
own.

Mikulyuk summed up rugby culture. “You play an in.
tense game, beat the shit out ortho other team, then you all
go get drunk together, sing songs, and follow hysterieal [ra-
ditions that usually involve taking in mass quantities ofal»
cohol,” she said.

Erik Anderson agreed that the underlying feature orrugby
eulture is the team's ability to put aside any hostilities that may
have developed over the course orthe game and embraee their
opponents.

“Whatever happens on the held and whatever animosity
there is, you always try to put that away and party and drink
with the other team,” he said.

While poshgame partying is eerrainly a key eomponenr of
the rugby eulture, on-the-field traditions can also be just as ex»
citing. The most storied iii—game antics of Grin -ll rugby in.

for the game to make up {or low numbers, and the “Zulu,"
where a rookies who score their ﬁrst tries run the length ofthe
piteh naked ifthe mood strikes them.

Miltulyuk said the women's team has had four “Zulu
warriors” already this year. The number is not surprlslngi
the Harpies are Fielding one of their best team: ever this
season.

“This year's team looks really good," Ruthie Anderson said.
“Saturday was our first game and we were working together
really well and aerually ran plays, something we never qtlllc
aeeomplished in previous seasons."

The Harpies won their game against Drake College 20.0
Saturday. While the men’s tcttln lost their: to the Clinton, Iowa,
tcain, Erik Anderson said the men's team looked good (his year
