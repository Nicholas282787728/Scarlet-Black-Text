A senior staff writer explains the differences of

living in town

Here it is, folks, your nrsr.hand ac.
count ofwhat it’s like to live offecampus.
Now, I’m no cxperliiusl movcd inro my
house during rhe middle of Augusr, in
factibut I can deﬁnitely talk about what
these last three or four weeks have been
like.

Needless to say, rhey’ve been quire

driveway and up she porch sreps. In-
sread ofwalking inro an immaculate.
fully furnished, eypically tiny dorm
room, I enrered a d'usry. elurrered mane
sion that somehow belonged (in parr,
at least) to me.
Old furniture and
boxes were every.
where; two of my
housemates, who
had already
moved in, gave me
a grand tour
rhrough rooms
that seemed al-
ready full. . .of
stuff that wasn't
even ours.

My room on the rop floor, however,
was miraculously empry and looked gir
ganrie righi off the bat. There was no
closet in sight, but the double bed,
hardwood ﬂoor, and the convenient
consistency of a bullcrin board more
rhan made up for ir. While I began
iinproduerively organizing mysruffinro
little piles on the floor, my dad scr ro

had been painecd shur). After abour half
an hour, he srood up, hammer in handi

allels between my new house and his

The Buddies/Mentors programs oﬁer students and a

Brummer to guess exactly how many pairs
rhcy supposedly supervise,

“One ofthc best things about the Bud»
dics program is rhar it arrraers all types of
students," said Wickstrom. “We have arhr
lctcs, rhespians, science maiors, and dancers
that all have terriﬁc buddy matches. I think
this really speaks to the natural draw Chil»

“we gcr a lor ofbabysiuers, people who
