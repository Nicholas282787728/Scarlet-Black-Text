sic by Arrimn or African-American trnsrs.

Last winter. when Lantz rerurned from a see
mester in Senegal and Pellowski came back from
studying in'cosro Rica and Belize, they decided
to start a radio show based on Senegalese music.
The idea rhen expanded, to include everything
from 19505 jazz to modern niohop.

”We inst really like to have run, to play what»
ever comes to mind," Lantz said.

We asked Lantz and Pellowsld to Come up
with their dream playlist e the songs dint, Put
together. would make {or a fantastic hour of ra-
dio. Michael Jackson’s “Man in the Mirror" was
their ﬁrst entry, followed by
“Alli’t No Sunshine” by Bill
Withers, which was featured
on the soundtrack to Nollmg
Hill

“Things rill Apart," by
the Roots, made the cut,
along with Mos 13ers song
“Love" and anything by
Bucna Vista Social Club. “To
thoung, Gifted and Black,"
by Nina Simone will remind readers ofGrinnell's
own talented vocal choir.

The pair also mentioned s new song by
Senegalese artist Yousson N’Dour about the
shooting by New York City police ofAmndou
Diallo. The song is a duet between N‘Dour and
the more well-known Wyeler.

“We just really like to
have fun, to play what-

out into more jazz and world music. ”It's hard
