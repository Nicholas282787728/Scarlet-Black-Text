Josh. i would like ro respond ro a couple points you made in
your oolumn in issue 2 enurled, “Dluemmas in Grinnell's shop.
ping Scene." lwas one ofa small group ofsrudenrs who pur up
rhose signs ro “Shop locally." Righr before school srarred, we
decided char ir was necessary ro inform firsr.year smdenrs (and
renirningsnrdenrs) abour die local alremativcs ro Wal.Marr.whidi
we believe has an unfair economic picsenoe in Grinncll and all
across rhe Unired Srares. We simply wanred ro raise a lirrle aware.

nco on campus. We are nor an official smdenr group. just a clos.

rer ofconcerned kids.

We've all heard rhe merirs ofdiversiry. Well. diversity an be
apphed to businesses jusr as ir can ro people Who would really
prefer a 5rarbucks ro sainrs Rest and hobs Undcrgmund? Maybe
we could get rid ofcafe Phoenix and pur in anorher McDonald’s.
Give me convenience and familiariryor give me dearlil Hell yeah.
WahMarr is cheap and an easy place to shop. bur i like a little
variery. i agree wirh your claim rhar all of rhe local srorcs surely
have ries ro corporare America, bur rhc difference berwecn
Cunningham’s Pharmacy and Wal.Marr is rhar Cunninghzm’s is a
uniqu: familyowned business. We have to ask ourselves. “Where
are my dollars going?" Do rhey flow inro rhe rarrered pocker ofa
srruggling local business owner, or inro Gucci waller ofrhe billion.
aire rhar sirs arop ofrhe Wal.Marr corporation?!

Capitalism has proven ro be a superior engine for growrh.
bur there must be limits in order to supporr fairness: hence anri.
rrusr legislarion. rhe Berter Business Bureau, ere. l by no means
call for an end ro corporare America. bur i am afraid ofa furure
economy dominarcd by rwo or rhree megacorporarions. I for
one enjoy rhe charm of local shops, and l much profer rhe experi-
ence ofwaiking rhrough downrown Grinncll srorcs rhan shopping

in die same old WabMarr rhar 2ppms in virrually every other city
in rhe counrry.

i am slighrly offended by your sraremenr that “Too often we
rake rhe lirrle rhings in life and make rhem bigger than rhey really
are." When a mom'n’pop business is shutdown bemuse ofWal.
Marr’s predatory practices. is rhar a “hrrle thing"? When behe.
morh wesrcm perroleum corporarions kick indigenous peoples off
of rheir land and is mcr wim rhrcars of mass suicide (ahem. . .oky
in Colombia), is d1:r:“llnle thing”? When rhe Umred stares
governmcnr imposes faral economic sanctions on lraq ro prorecr
irs own economic inrerests. is that a “little thing"? lr is far roo easy
to playdown or even ignore rhc many iniusriees rhar are raking

Finally. I agree wholehearrcdly rhar mosr movemenrs do on.

on. Thank you for rhe ldck in rhe burr. Along the same lines.
howevcr, perhaps we should also work on decreasing the cynicism.

Support diversity

Dear Faeulry Members. .

llasr springl, Prcsidcm Osgood was rhe fearured gucsr ar rhe
Brown bag Lunch Series. and rhe ropiewas “Diversify ar Grinncll "
in his presenranon. Presidcnr osgood discussed his “Diversiry ar
Grinncll" documcnr. which he hoped would spark a much-needed
dialogue on rhe issue. l=urrhermorc, rhose in arrendanee addressed
rhe presidcnr wirh questions on rhe administration's commirrncnr
to a diverse Grinnell college community. Wirh regard ro specific
oucsrions abour rhe issue, rhe president appeared. as many specra.
rors pm in “ro evade rhe issue." However, he made one sraremenr
clean “Faculty hire faculty.“ Thar is, faculry are responsible for rhe
lack ofprogress in hiringfaeulry ofcolor

ln rhis lerrcr. we pur forrh rhc claim rhar, rhough some fac.
ulry members have pur forrh a genuine efforr regarding rhe diver.
siry issue. not enough hu been done in order to march char com.
mirmenr with acrual results. Therefore, we would like to make rhe
following indicrmenrs:

1) While more are faculry members who are very commirged
in seeing more faculty of color ar Grinnell. there are orher faculiy
members who are nor commirred ro rhis goal. Moreover. there is a
level ofinsrirurionalized racism rhar cxisrs nor only wirhin rhe ad.
minisrrarlon bur also wirhin some pans ofrhc faculry.

2) lr is appalling rhar of die rhree faculry of color up for ren.
ure in me lasr couple ofyars, only one received ir.

3) Ar a faculry reuear rwo years ago. diversity (that is. auracr.
ing more srudenrs. faculry. adminisriarors. and sialrmembers of
color) was cired as one of rhe rop issues mar needed to be ad.
drcaed. Unfortunately. rhe efforts made since rhen have nor been
consisrenr wirh rhe concern expressed.

4) Though rhcre was rhe addition ofa computer science nc.
ulry posinon (which was obviously needed due ro rhe large num-
ber of majors) and rhe crearion ofa Japanese deparrmmr. rhe ini.
rial railrofaeguiring more joint posirions in the Africina studies
concentration has gone unheralded.

5) There was inadequate supporr from rhe faculry ro keep
LcArmc Howe, rhe firsr Narive American professor in Grinnell
College’s hisrory.

6) According ro rhe adminrsrrarion, a proposal ro create fac.
ulry posirions in fields rhar mighr increase rhe diversiry of the he
ulry was rablcd by rhe faculryded Dreeurive Council.

As srudcnrs. we erpecr ro ger rhe besr liberal arrs cduearion
available from Grinnell College. Moreover. we believe that a di-
verse faeulry rhar is represenrarivc of the world in which we live.
and is criricai ro achieving rhc rrue liberal arts experience. We be.
lieve rhar rhe faculry musr go above and beyond in eurrenr ar.
remprs ar bringing people of color ro Grimell.

The argumcnr rhar people ofcolor are hard ro come by in a
specific deparrmenr is a poor excuse. There are oonfcrenees all over
rhe counrry rhar are designed ro pool people ofcolorwlrhin many
disciplines. Conferences like these are similar ro college fairs rhar
are heavily arrended by Grinnell College admissions officers In

addition. if it is so hard ro ger people of color to a loiarion like
Grinnell. rhen whar is ro be said abour rhe faculry ofcolor who are
already here: Was rhcir coming here less impressive or important?

Therefore, we would like to see rhc following demands met:

1) We would like ro see an admissions ofﬁcer for faculry of
color here ar Grinncll wirhin rhe ncxt 18 monrhs. We chink rhar
rlie faculry should work wirh rhe adminisrrarion wirh die inrenr of
hiring rhe person mosrqualified for rhe Diversiry officer posirion.
rhe quality ofrhe individual is ofrhe essence. nor expediency. Any
faculry member who knows ofa person gualihed ro be rhe officer
should oonracr rhe adrmmsrrarion and be proacrive in getting rhar
person ro crinnell College. .

2) We would like ro see more (and differenr) people of color
in all rhree divisions and in all dcparrmeno here at Grinnell Col.
lege. The argumenrs that (1) people ofcolor are hard to come by
in a specific major and (2) Grinncll’s loiarion is derrimenral ro
gerring people ofcolor here at Grinncll are unacecprablc. Wirhin
rhe year. we wanr ro sec Black. Asian, Latino/a. and Narivc Amen.
ean professors (and more man one ofeach), appoinrcd across rhe
curriculum. including rhe division of science.

a) We warn an inquiry done as ro why Andre Robinson, an

MSlR and a CSMP candidare, was firsr denied a CSMP fellow.
ship. rhen rcconsidcrcd as a possible eandidarc, and rhcn again
denied. We would like ro be nouned by Oerobcr as ro why he. a
person who had inrereso in coming ro Grinnell College, was de.
nicd a CSMP fellowship here. in addinon. we wanr an answer as
so why LcAnne Howc was nor offered a renurc.rrack faeiilry posi.
non. .
4) The issue ofarrracring and reroning fieulry ofcolor should
be done on s divisional level. nor on a general faculty level Each
division head musr nor only make a commiimcnr ro diversiry bur
should be instrumcmal in calling porcnrial faculry candidares.
mccringwim rhem for dinners and inrerviews, and following up
wirh phone calls. emails. and lerrers. We wanr meetings ro'com.
mence wirhin rwo weeks afrer the faculry has us New Baculry on.
cnrarion.

5) The Afrimna Srudles coneenrrarion should acquire more
faculty in ioinr posirions wirhin a period ofrwo years,

6) lfrhe Division of Humaniues can show a vorc of “no con.
ﬁdcnce" in rhe Public kelarions offioe, rhen ir, as well as rhc orher
divisions, can show a vote of “confidence” in support ofreeruiring
more faculry ofcolor ro Grinnell. We would like to see sudi a vore
from each division within weeks ofrerurningro campus in rhe fall.

7) Each deparrmenr should have people designared ro arrend
conferences where porenrial faculry ofcolor are likely to be. There
should be dirccr conracr with a porenrial candidare and follow-ups
done in hopes ofgeoing rhe sandidare on campus. Afaculry mem.
ber from each department should work wish us in drafting a Fund
for Farcellence proposal ro create a fund our ofwhieh money for
supporring faculty ofcolor reeruionenr could be retrieved. Appar.
enrly, similar proposals made by rhe Diversiry lniriarivo Group.
rhe Dean of rhe Faculry’s omoe. and she Diversity Sreering Com.
mirree were nor viewed as imporranr enough by eirher rhe presi.
denr or rhe Executivc Council ro deserve acLion.

We realize rhar rhe commirmenr ro hire more faculry ofcolor
is not only a faculry responsibiliry but also one for srudenrs and
rhe adrninisrrarion. However. rhis lerrer. aswell as rhe lerrer primed
in rhe scarier 8: Black on May 13. 2000 (which received supporr
from over 300 srudenrs (look ar wwwgrinnelleduisandb for a re.
prim). should serve as evidence char rhere are srudenrs on rhe
Grinnell College campus who are commirred ro having a very di.
verse faculry. We have ourlined our problems wirh whar rhe fac.
ulry is doing abour diversiry and have made demands rhar we feel
will be producrive. Though we realize rhar many decisions relaring
ro faculty hircs are made by rhc Erecurive Council Commirree.
members ofrhar commirree are also members ofrlie faeulry rhem.
selves. We need aerion from individual faculry members, deparr.
menrs. divisions, and the faeulryded Executive Council.

We sincerely hope rhar you will respond to our letter in a
posirive. dclibcrarc marrcr.

Cordially.

than living it alone

We have all had the experience: you're sitting with
a group of people in uuad or Cowles or your dorm
room. or'the loggio, or basically anywhere on campus
and without warning. conversation suddenly turns to
biology. For the poor non-bio major out there (yes,
we do exist), this can be more than a little annoying.
rhe non.bio person ﬁnds herself drowning in a dialogue
of DNA-replication plays, cell.counting. Jackie Brown’s
kids, or anything else remotely related to the subject
of biology.

Sure. it’s wonderful that Grinnell. as a liberal arts
college, has a strong science division. Howeverr it has
come at the expense of the non-bio majors' sanity.
here is a reason I don't take bio: I don't want to hear
anything about its Non-bio majors of Grinnell, unite!
Let’s begin by scaring away all the bio prospies.

0: why on earth would you steal a wafﬂe maker?

Creativity aside. this is the most useless pmnk I
can think of. An industrial-Sized wafﬂe maker has a
very limited niche. It can ﬁt effectively in either a)
Paul Bunyan's cabin, or b) a dining hall. I am fairly
sure that neither Paul nor his big blue ax were present
at the scene of the crime. which leads me to believe
that the wafﬂe maker would he better off if it had
stayed put. Furthermore, rhave yet to see a store
that sells Carbon's Malted Waffle mix. Without this
essential ingredient. the‘wame maker is quite use-
less. And another thing, where does this school ﬁnd
a wafﬂe maker that costs $650? If people in the
dining hall are so absorbed in their food that no one
happens to notice when a large, shiny wafﬂe maker
walks out the door, maybe we shouldn’t invest in the
J. Crew model wafﬂe iron. -Parrr Marks

[am not a girl

I enjoy wearing necklaces, nail polish, and rings.
but I am not a girl. Not that there is anything
wrong with being a girl, and in no way am Ideﬁn»
ing a girl to be a person who wears such articles.
When people call me a “girl." I wonder why they

.think that I’m a girl? I have just noticed strange

reactions from both guys and girls alike when I am
wearing such articles. Which brings me to another
point. Though you might have heard otherwise, I
am a heternsexualr I am attracted to girls. You
might have heard my friends calling me gay, color»
blind, stupid, and Asian, all of which are true, but
when they say gay, they mean happy. There has
been some confusion in the past about these quali-
ties and Ijust want to clear them up.
