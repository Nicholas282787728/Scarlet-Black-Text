How to write a
scientific paper

All examples are rakeu from rhe rexr oflab reporrs 1 have
personally wrirrcn or co.aurhored in my illusrrious career ar
Grinncll. Okay, yeah, some are from rough drafrs.

The ride should sueeineiiy esplam whar your paper is
abour. This informanon will help your professor decide iryour
paper is aerually worrh reading. Example: “Agriculruml heads
warer srreams and prairie headwarer srreanis ar CERA eonrain
similar maeroinverrehrare eomniiinirTcs."

The inrroduerion should explain why you did yoursriidy
1r should begin wirh relevanr soniexrual informer. ii and end
wirh your speciﬁc plan ofarraek Example; "Most people pie.
riire whire eggs when rhey think of chicken eggs, yer mosr
chicken breeds lay brown eggs. one breed, rho whire leghorn,
lays 9 our orevery ll) ehieken eggs in rhe Unired Srares. The
ieghorn is used because ir lays eggs ar double rhe rare oforher
kinds ofehiekens . . .We resred our hyporhesis by using elece
rrophoresis ro run gels or puriﬁed samples ofegg yolk and egg
whire proreins. Eleerrophoresisseparared rhe prorcins based on
size, allowing us ro esamine the gels for unique proreins."

The merhods seeeion should explain how you conduered
your research. lfyou wenr ro rhe Feds for help, be sure in :c»
knowledge rh:m Example: “We used our FBI scores ro ealeu.
lare rhe percenrsimilariry ofonr referencesiees (wirhm CERA)
ro our resr sires (originaring ourside cum.”

The resuhs seerion should summarize rhe resulrs obrained.
Do nor presenr raw dam. Example: “We observed early on in
the experimenr rhar improved Basic planrs were generally raller
man she Asrroplanrs (do we wane ro eruneh numbers here?)

Your discussion should clearly and concisely iiirerprer your
resuirs.1fyou susperi rhere was an error in your experimenr,
acknowledgeirand move on hmmple- Previous research shows
rhar birds will reduce mass when esposed ro a predarory shrear
(Lilliendahl 1997). Ar CERA rwo large dogs ruii freely through»
our rhe area. if rhese dogs harassed rhe iiineos in me aviary
during rhe srudy, rhe iuiicos would be expected ro lose mass in
response re. rhe rhrear." -

And ﬁnally, donir forges to thank rhose who helped you:
Also, if you have rime, you mighr wane ro submir a page of
ieferences iisring who rho professor can call ro ﬁnd our more
aboui your personal eharacrer and sriidy habirs. Example: “We
would like ro rhank Professor Eclsharr for his advice on experi-
menial design and srarisrical analysis. We would also like ro
rhank rhe many Bram'm involved in rhis srudy for giving rheir
lives ro science, and we roundly scold rhe aphids (AP/sided”)
for arrempring ro saborage our efforo.

Looking at the ‘killer’tomatoes

Malinda winter ‘00
guest columnist
Whilc1 agree wirh’ several poinrs Richard Mankhey made

in his “Attack ofrhe killer tomatoes?" column (Dec 1), I be- .

lieve rhar he skimmed over some very imporianr anrirgmcti-
cally modiﬁed organism (GMO) argumenis. 1 agree wirh him
rhar “consumers deserve ro know borh sides ofrhe issue." Ad-
dirionally, 1 agree rhar anti»GMO argumenrs can somerimes
be reacrioriary and emorional. Misusing biological rerms such
as muranr and labeling Flaw Saw romaroes as “killer roma.
roes" are effecrive raeries ro ger people's arrenrion, bur are nor
sound argumenrs. However. Mankhey presenrcd an almosr
one-sided argumenr in supporr ofGMOs rarher rhan giving
equal rime ro well—researched anterMO argiimenrs.

Mankhey claimed rirar generieally engineered foods have
“grear porenrial for agricuhure and world food produerion."
He did nor meiirioii rhar many bioreeh companies eurrenrly
offer seeds for GMOs for free in impoverished narions bur
require rhar farmers do nor co‘llecr seeds for use rhe nexr year
Theeompanies could srop giving rheseedsfor free ar my poinr,
and rhe farmers would be dependeni on rhem for seeds. Some
of rhe GM crops, nicknamed ”terminator" crops by opponeiirs,
do nor even produce seeds, furiliei inducing rhe dependence
of rho farmer. if she eompanies ever ceased providing seeds.
rhe poor farmers would nor have rhe iiioiiey ro huy seeds, which
would cause rurrher world hunger problems.

Maiikhcy also did nor iiienrion golden rice, rhe rice engi.

Mankhey also poinred our rhar planr and animal breede
ers have been looking for rhe kind of favorable changes tlur
genericisrs are eurrenrly seeking for hundreds or years. He
also poinred out rhar rhe breeders process has hazards and can
rake a much longer period ofrime ro ﬁnd a good rrair. Addi»
nonally, geiiericisrs can do more precise resring ihan pianr
breeders could in rhe pasr avoiding rhe nororioiis poisonous
poraroes produced by planr breeders. However, GMO proe
resrers bring up a key difrerenee Mankhey did nor disclose.
Breeders only cross organisms in rhe same family, while go.
neric engineers splice in genes from differenr kingdoms inro
organisms. using highly iinielared organisms could resiilr in
highly unprediered consequences ro rhe enviroiimenr and
uiipredicred allergies and roxins ro humans. Combining genes
from a virus wuh genes from a cauliflower is much differenr
rhan adding pollen from a pea planr ro anorhcr pea planr, sphc.

could crcare an unknown inreracrion wirh rhe cauliflower genes

Mankhey did finally admir rhar GMOs are “not ivirhour

every consequenee rhar rhe iiirrodnerion of generically modi.
ﬁed organisms will resiilr in." He proceeded ro suggesr rhar
rhe human raceshould learn from misrakes. Whileall ofrhese
