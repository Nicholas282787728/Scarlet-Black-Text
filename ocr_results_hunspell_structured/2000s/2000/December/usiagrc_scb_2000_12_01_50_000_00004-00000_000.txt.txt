Au Fait

by Sarah Aswell
Arls Edilor

When I think about
had high school
experiences, I think «If
taking the SATs on
Saturday morning,
getting lost in the
woods during the cross
country running state
meet, and going to
Prom. I hated high
school pram and
everything it stood for.
It was expensive and
awkward and you were
tied to your date due
to social laws and
regulations. It was
about who looked
better and who's data
looked better. And i
had a curfew.

So when snmeone
told me about Waltz
my ﬁrst year at
Grinnell, 1 was very
'weary abaut attending.
Am I going to feel like
crying the whole time
lam there? is my dress
strap going to break as
I step out or the limo
(true Story)? Is that
bitch who flew to Paris
to get her Prom dress
going to be declared
queen (true also)?

I found out that
Waltz has very little in
common with prom, in
tact, it is what pram
should have been.
There is no pressure to
bring a date, If your
not having fun, you
can leave. It is free if
you still have your old
prom dress or a suit
(and if it still ﬁts after
your repeated runrins
with Quad road). Plus,
that Prom queen skank
who ruined your life in
high school has
probably flunked out
of State u., USA by
now and is getting
sexually harassed at
her minimumrwage
waitressing job on a
daily basis'. Not that
I'm still bitter or
anything.

When eke dues the
whole campus ever
hang out together at
once? When else are
you going to have the
Chance to waltz with
that quiet kid in you
psychology class or
with your girlfriend for
that matter? When else
are you going to see
me wearing makeup
and uncomfortable
shoes? When else can
you spend a night in
Harris without grinding
with a stranger on the
Catwalk? When else
can you waltz?

Waltz will not
emotionally scar you
like Prom did. It will
not be boring or scary
or unromfvrtable. In
fact, I can guarantee
that it might even be
fun.

We haven’t seen this crap, so you should
