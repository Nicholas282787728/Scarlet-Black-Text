It's true. The two
party system has gotten
out of hand. As I See
it, the two main camps
consist of untalented,
formulated puppets.
Not only that, but
these two parties,
which are practically
the same, make it
impossible for third
party groups to enter
into any sort or
competitive race for
popular support.

What I'm trying to
say is, with ’N Syn: and
The BackStreet Boys
dominating the boy
band market, there is
simply no room tor
other boys bands to
make any sort of mark.
What about 98 Degrees,
you ask? Iaskyou,
what about them?

These two boy hands
Show no deﬁning
features, arid for the
most part, all the
information I know
about the two groups
blends together. ror
instance, even though i
know for a fact that
Justin Timberlake iS hot
(source: my kid sister),
I would be hardrpressed
to know if he sung the
solo in 'As long as Vou
Love Me" or “God Must
Have Spent a Little
More Time on You”,
And even though I have
been informed that
Howie DIS favorite
types of food are
spaghetti and cereal,
I'm not quite sure it he
means he likes eating
spaghetti and cereal
together or as separate
entities.

Furthermore, these
two hands seem to be
equally as popular.
When appearing as
guests on MTV’s rotal
Request Live, both
groups produced
roughly the same sized
hoard or prepuhesrent
girls with posters
yelling outside the
Studio. These hoards of
girLs also carried
roughly the same sized
posters, arid screeched
at very similar
frequencies.

What we rleed as a
country is a new
musical group. One
with real talent, new
ideas, and no history
with the Mickey Mouse
club. This new group
will write all of their
own songs, make more
intelligent videos, and
never partially bleach
their hair. These two
groups need to be
stopped, and the
person to stop them is
Ralph Nader. With his
help, the American
people can surely wave
the boy bands or the
past bye, hye, hye.

The Power of the Word

Chinese calligraphy art exhibit comes to Faukoner Gallery

By Allison Dolan

i had no preconceptions or expccrarions as I walked inro rhe

However, 1 rock a Srep back wh=n I walked into rhe gallery. Againsr
the soft and light wood with: room screamed bold and stark black,

audacity of rhc color and size. lnsresd of rho delicare, light

an and hcaury in each chamcrcr, bur it also explores poetry and
other mediums. In contrast to the previous exhibit, Carol to Pimsor
Power of the Word concentrates on modern manifcsrarions of the
arr orChincse calligraphy. The exhibit encourages exploration and
expands to ﬁt areas otinrcrcsr outside [he an world. ‘

The layout or the exhibit is very sinking; it easily rakes you
through a logical progression arworks. Beginning with traditional
poems written on modestly sized sheets orrice paper and mounted
on parchment. rhc gallery offers rranslarions orrhc poems next to
the pieces On: ofthc lessons 1 leaned from this exhibit was the
intentional spacing and layout orsornc poems. The works come

so beauiirully that rhc original must be a rruc

Several other ofninc nrnsts cxhihtrcd have
poems on display as well as oihcr larger works.
The bold line and colors in some oFrlic larger
canvases respond ro poliuciil climates in China
