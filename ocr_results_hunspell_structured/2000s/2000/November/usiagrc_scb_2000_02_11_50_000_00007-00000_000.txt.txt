when is seemed Greene was sryrng roo hard so make

peal of an already dimcultemelike characters sa—
rah srushiully does nor have much ofa characser
until Book Pour (the novel is divided inso five
books), when we ges so see how her mind works.
Book Four offers a complere change from she pre»
vious shrcc books, During shis session ofshc novel,
Bendrlx is reading Sarah’s personal diary, which
allows Greene so efrecsrvcly sell she srory from a

reader can now see bosh sides of she affair, and

This scgmcns of she novel was easrly my favorire

I was nos overly impressed by is, bus 1 ccrsainly
