Overall tips:

I Deli bar lettuce is better than salad bar lettuce,

0 Never eat anything in the hot food line that has "Grinrlell" in the
title.

- Use the spices at the end of the salad bar. They help.

. Heating things up almost always makes things better. Don’t be
afraid to microwave.

0 Steam salad bar veggies (add a little water, cover with a plate or
bowl and microwave).
