The increased offensive diver -

agreed “We bave a srrong group

Even with the talented new-

“Mosr reams bave one, rwo, rbrec defensive guys and

“We're hoping for 115.3 points per

tistical goals of 94 shots, 47 threes,
offensive rebounds on 33 percent
of the misses, force 32 turnovers and
take 25 more shots than the oppor

everything will take care of itself
