Eight years

Open season on Hillary Rodham Clinton: andcoummg

1 have the deepest respect for Hillary Rodham Clinton.
She has courageously withstood fierce, unfair attacks for the
past eight years. Everything is fair game. For example, an antia
Hillary website sponsorsa Win theHillary voodoo Dol1"cone
test. 1 contestants write statements explaining why they would
like to stick it to Hillary. A display or the more entertaining
entries reveals that some entrants are not shy about saying where
they would stick to Hillary. Her vagina, for instance.

These latest niceties are directed at Hillary's run for a New
York Senate seat, but the First lady has been under persistent
attack since 1992. To ﬁnd a political figure who faced a similar
magnitude and scope ofpetsonai attacks, we probably have to
go past Dan Quayle and Richard Nixon, whose respective come
petencc and presidential actions informed the bulwark ofpubc
lie criticism. I think you have to go all the way back to Abraham
Lincoln. Today we speak with pride or his log.cabin upbringr

historianAlbert Shaw writes, "Lincoln drawn by car

dignified, making an appeal to our feelings of re.
gard and veneration. Nothing could be in greater
contrast than the cartoons ofhis own lifetime."

Obviously, in the 1860:, such rumors were meant to under
mine Lincolns credibility Hillary faces a similar rorm of this
treatment, She is a suspected lesbianc because she stands up for
equal rights for gays and lesbians. Hillary the Lesbian also min»
forces the popular belief that her marriage is purely strateg .
And here is where the Clinton Lincoln comparison breaks
down. An ingrained part or today s Lincoln Logs story is that
despite his backwoods upbringing, "Lincoln as a lad was wont
to remark that he would someday be President. "7 To that end.
Lincoln married a wealthy Kentucky woman. Lincoln received
considerable criticism from Southerners and Northerners about
his wife’s southern heritage,” but oddly enough, the cartoons
ists and politicians ofthe day largely spared Lincoln criticism
for marrying into wealth for political gain. indeed, the mar-
riage gave him legitimacy as a serious political ﬁgure.”

Above all else, Hillary is demonized ror her political ambi.
tion. Before Watergate and Lewinsky, people bashed Hillary
for her obvious interest in politics. The one constant of the
Hillary attacks over the years is an aversion to Hillary‘s pub.

The doctor that has been in chargcoftlie study since 1976, but
did not want to be named, said that there is no Board ofTrusb

supposedly has in tact comes from a National
Science Foundation grant. This money is used
to keep the experiment running, and is also used
to pay various publications, such as US. Nrius &

that the purpose of Grinnell has been brought to light, hows
ever, the school will have to be shut down. When asked what
current students will do to finish their educations, a JHU spokesa
