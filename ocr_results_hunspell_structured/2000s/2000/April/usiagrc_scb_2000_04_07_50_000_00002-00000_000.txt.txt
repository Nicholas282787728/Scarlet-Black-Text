Bringing affirmative action back

Two Californians work to put the' Issue on the ballot' In November

(U WHIP.) BERKELEY, Calif. .. Advo-
cates ofsfrirmttivo action are currently Cir-
culating petitions for two separate ballot ini-
risrivcs —- one ofwhicb also ends student fees
.. to reinstate race nrid gender preferences in
California.

Ron Rodriguez, the oificial proponcntof
a constitutional amcndmcnr to rcpcal Proper
sition 209, was cleared to begin collecting
signatures on March 24, according to Cali-
fornia Secretary ofstorc spokesperson Shad
oalch.

Rodrigucz has until Junc 29 to collect
670,816 signatures to place the proposition
on tho Novombcr ballort if he misses that

deadline, the irom can be decided during a
later election ifhc can collect the signatures
by Aug. 21.

Mervin Evans, a los Angelcs invcstmcnt
banker, is also collecting signatures for an
inltialivc‘ to revise California‘s consritution
and allow “preferences for historical victims
of racism or sexism,"

Evans said his initiative would include a
1.5 percent tax on retail sales to cicatc asrnre
education fund. Halfof rhc fund would be
used to eliminate all studentrrelated fccs for
California residents in rbc state's public col»
logos and universities.

"A middloolass family with two children

can barely steroid a house and a car now,“
Evans said, “The best investment we can
make is to provide them access to higher
education."

The other hdfoftho fund would be used
to Create collegebound programs for ccor
nomicaliy disadvantaged children.

uc Regcanard connerly, who led the
campaign for Proposition 209 in 1996, said
he neither ballot initiative will pass,

“They are livingon another planer ifthey
think the people of California want to go
back to rbc days of preferences and dc facto
quotas," he said. "They'vc got rhcir heads in
thesand."
