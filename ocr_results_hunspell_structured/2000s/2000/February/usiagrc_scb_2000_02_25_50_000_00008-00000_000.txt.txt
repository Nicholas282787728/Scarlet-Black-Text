chamber of commerce and the city council, and also from the trustees and
the administration that will be here in 20 years.”

Space for multicultural groups?

”I did spend a little bit time on the space issue last year as spokesperson For
ASIA [Asian Students in Alliance] [think that what came through, what
all the organizations agreed upon is that there dehnitely needs to be more
multicultural space on campus, or at least a commitment to multicultural
space, but we'le willing to allow the wishes of the whole campus to take
precedent as long as there is some effort made to address the issues that
we've raised.

Capstones?

"It goes against the philosophy or the school to require something like a
capstone. At the same time, I think that the majon'ty of students given the
opportunity will choose to complete something like a capstone .. Whether
that takes the form or an honors ordject or an internships or an externship or
a summer research grant, the school should make sure it makes opportunities
available for students who want them."

What would you change about Grinnell?

”There need to be more professors, more 200 level classes We need to
focus on getting more quality professors here, the king that will get tenure
and spend 30 years here, and that students are going to remember tor the
rest of their lives

What would you keep?

"I think that right now the student government association and the campus
organizations and the faculty and the administration
all have a pretty strong rapport I think it’s

very important that we hold onto the strengths
that we have ant that we voice our opinions in

a mature way so that we continue to be

treated as equals by the faculty."

Approach to campaigning:

- 2 page statement of intent.

democratic deliberation .. rthink it’s very important to focus not rust on the role of the vice
president, but the vice president with in the context of cabinet, the president and student
government as a whole,”

what is your take on the master plan?

”I just think that too many people are treating it now as a solid unchangeable thing, and it's
not, It's a temporary plan. It's not going to be implemented for a matter of years. And there's
still plenty of time to hear student voices."

Space for multicultural groups?

"I feel that multicultural space is important There are so many voices within the multicultural
community, What would best be done would be lo have a strong student groups liaison who
worked closely with dirrerent multicultural groups, and listened to everyone's voices,"
tapstones?

”The capstone should be dehned as soon as possible to encourage feedback. I’m interested in
expanding capstones to internships or externships It's kind or like an apprenticeship, Having
it extended would take the burden off the faculty.’

What would you change about Grinnell?

"Anger That is so negative. i don’t think there are as many angm students at Grinnell as you
might think Minor programs 7 Basically it's about expanding the concentration [just
wouldn't call it a concentration. I don't know what I would call it, but it wouldn't be a
concentration because I don't think that term means anything to anyone."

what would you keep?

"Freedom coming though responsibility It's like

[Protessor] Siniawe was saying in seminar. Tr you're in

a boat witha bunch of people, and this person ahs

just decided, 'Hey, I want to put a hole in the boat

They’re acting in their own selfcinterest, but it's

freedom, right? They can put a hole in the boat. But

when your heedom sacrihces the good of everybody,

when evelyone’s going down tor your freedom. with

self-governance, you have to be aware of others.”

Approach to campaigning:

- "I prefer substance over style, but I really do wish

there was a color ror my name, The closestT

could come was this awful salmon pink

that I’m using ror my signs."

discussion, which is good. The student center is a great Idea-,1
think increasing space at the library is also great As far as
moving Darby and the whole REC. issue, 1 really don't have an
opinion on that.
Space for multicultural groups?
”I think we're moving forward with the space I really don't see
it as as big ofa problem now, because there's a solution in the
tuture. For immediate solutions, we're trying to use the space
that we have."
Capstones?
"I already sit on the curriculum committee, so I’m a lot more
aware ofwhat’s going on with capstones with a lot or the
student body Ideally, it will be deﬁned in a broader spectrum
1 see it encompassing several dinerent types or things. Primarily
something like a higher level independent course and something
like a higher level seminar We’re trying something, that doesn’t mean that we necessarily have to go ahead
and do it, It's just like a test"
What would you change about Grinnell?
“1 think we really need to look at the academics on campus, to see which departments are in need, which could
use more proressors I’d like to see ore-professional programs be more respected on campus, like the education
department."

What would you keep? .
"T like the structure that we have now, as tar as we have academic majors and we don't have minors I like the

concentrations we have. I think they’re great, There probably could be more, but I think it's a good program we
have going. 1 like the tact that there is student representation on major committees concerning academic issues
on this campus.“

Approach to campaigning:
- Blue signs that say ”paid for by Josh Blue" » "in that regard, I’m a little bit abstract.”
