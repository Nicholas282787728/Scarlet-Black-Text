College is orren seen as a
place and time where young
people find themselves. This
was true for Katie Kiskad-
don, but the identity she found
might be a bit outside of what
Grinnellians normally expecr
In December 2003, Kiskaddon
converted to Islam after study 7
ing many different religions. “It
was a lot of, (this is how I bee
lieve things, and this religion
actually embodies a lot of things
that I believe,"v Kiskaddon said.
“I really consider that I'm still
searching for mi. and new
meaning."

Kiskaddon’s family and other
Grinnellians
have gener—
ally been veiy
supportive of
her choice.
“[My tam-t»
ly’s] always been really open ro
new things, but then it was ac-
mally happening. They‘ve been
really good about it, though.”

After graduarion, Kiskaddon
will marry Rashed Chowdhury
‘03 in a civil ceremony in Ohio,
"We couldn’t ﬁnd a licensed
imam to perform the ceremony,"
Kiskaddon said. “We're doing a
religious ceremony/,just with an
unofﬁcial imami"

Chowdhury is currently a
smdenr at McGill University’s
Institute of Islamic Studies in
Montreal, and Kiskaddon will
be joining him in Canada. “I’m

she said.

“It’s important for people
to see how much rhey have in
common," Kiskaddon said. “You
can get to demonizing anorbcr
group."

Kiskaddon converted imr
mediarely before leaving for
France for a semester abroad.
The Muslim headscarf. which
Kiskaddon wears now but did
not then, is a very controversial
symbol in France.

“I wore my scarf once, and
they yelled at me in my school,

It’s not very neutral, because it’s

Her impending marriage
seems to dominate Kiskaddon’s
near future. “Being married, I’ll
eventually have a family," she
mused. ”I don‘t have big plans
about having a really high
powered career. I do think it’s
important, ifI have kids. to stay
home with them."
