I Absurdity takes the stage with Eugene lonesco’s

BY COLIN REYNOLDS
A British husband and wife sit opposite
one another in the parlor. The husband reads
a newspaper. A nearby clock chimes approxi-
mately two dozen times. “There,"says the wife
as she darns a stocking, “It’s nine o' clock," So
begins Eugene lonesco’s play, The Bald Sofrmw,
soon to bc perfmmcd by Grinnch's Silly Do-
Norhing Players. Ionesco described The Ball!
Sofmlw, his first dramatic work, as an “311er
play," and today it is considered part of the
canon ofthc “theatei of the absurd.”
Absurdisin is a rather difﬁcult concept
to deﬁne, as evidenced by the slighrly pained
looks on the faces of cast members when asked
for a deﬁnition of the movement, According
to Adam Schwartz ’05, the absurdist move-
ment was an artistic reaction to the horrors of
the Second World War. it was conceived as an
"uprooung oftlic rulcs orlogic and rarionaliry"
because the war had given rhcsc rules a very
lurid character.
However, The Bald Safmmi itself
has norhing to do With war and is of-
ten quite comical. “Our production

properly." said Selnvam. “The char
acters are very committed to rational
discourse, though to us, what they're
saying makes no sensc." According
to Mark Gardiner ‘05, the play pokes
fun ar “the banaliry ofevcryday coir
versation” and the way that people
at social gatherings tend to speak to
one anorhcr simply for (lie sake of
speaking.

According to the players’ essay,
TIM BaldSopmlm was nriirrcn as a re-
sult ofthc Romanian-born Ionesco's
attempts to learn English. The book

Eng/{:11 Marla Easy conrained practice searches
es such as “There are seven days in a week," and
“The ﬂoor is down; the ceiling is up." Ionesco
placed sentences like these into the mouths of
his characters, causing them to debate such
seemingly obvious quescions as,“1iihe doorbell
rings, is there always someone there?"

In The Bald Sa/mma it is not the plot that
matters. The play takes place inside a middle
class house in ”the suburbs of London." It rc-
volves around a series of conversations benveen
Mr. and Mrs. Smith and their neighbors, the
Martins. Two other diameters, Mary the maid
and the fire chief, appear from time to time.
Distinctions among the charncrers are rnnni»
fcsrcd only outwardly, and there is no characccr
development as in traditional drama. Thus. one
actor can easily switch characters With another
using a very simple costume change, as often
happens in this prodncrion. In fact, tour acrers
play all six roles. Husbands arc disringuished

from wives only by rhc presence of
a solid-colored tie or a Wilma Flin-
stone-style necklace. The identity
