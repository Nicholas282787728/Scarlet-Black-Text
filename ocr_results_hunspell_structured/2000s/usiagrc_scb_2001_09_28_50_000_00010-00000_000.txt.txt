Get a room: love, sex 8t everything in between

“Hello, this is Jennie, inayI pleasespeals with lon.>"That's all
it took for her to hate me.

I had never met the woman; I would never meet the woman,
but with one question she hated me. My relationship with ion
was doomed. It turns out that my first mistake was calling him
“Jon" and not “Jonathan," silly me, having jusr met him and only
knowing him 33“]on," I thought his name was an uncapandable
“John”. The second thing was that I had a polite phone voice, I
was purposely polite. Mothers are supposed to like polite people.
Not this modierﬁ polite phone voice meant that I ivas overly
critical.

Kyle’s mother hated me, too I think it's bemuscl called him
too late one night. it
9:30 is too late.

In high school. I
was doomed to have
my boyfriends
mothers hate met I
think I’ve had better
luck in college.
Maybe it’s because
now when I call my
boyfriends, their agreeln
roommates answer, =
not their mothers, The thing that doesn’t make sense is that I've
done worse things to make mothers hate me in college than the
sheer aet ortalling their son. Then again, I’ve met the mothers of
my college boyrriends, save one. I’ve never met ions and Kyle's
momers. Maybe once mothers meet me, my undeniable charm
saves me from the telephone iinit. ~

The problem presents itselrwhen you think of the way that
I’ve met these modaers. I once showed up in a dorm room, wear.
ing full Mary B. James drag, looking for a tie, only to find his
mother sitting on do bed.

I visited my boyfriend over one Christmas break, and on the
ﬁrst afternoon, I lost my boyfriend to a rampant neighborhood
dog. So I had to Find my way back to his house. with his dogs, and
then try to :xplain to his confused mother whyI had the dogs, but
not her son. These mothers liked me. They stilllike me. and I’m
no longer dating their sonsl

So what makes a mother like you? Is it beeause I shouldn't
have dared those high school boys, but hold no regrets aboot my
college relationships,> Is it because I've had chances to ehange those
ﬁrst impressions? Or is it inst because I've never had to deal with
them on the phone?

Maybe the phone is my ultimate curse. In the process ofask.
ing ii the obrect of my affection is home, I haven't been able to
demonstrate my sparkling conversation skills and my diplomatic
ways ofdisagrtunge I'm notable to demonstrate that I'm not try.
ing to steal her son away and corrupt him. I can’t rcassiirc her with
my sweet and innocent smile that my intentions are pure. Sadly, I
haven‘t met the current mother, but the last time she called, I did

Maybe the phone is my ult

Host a trustee
complaint

Dear Editor:

upon researching for a newspaper assignment
this week on the history ofcrinnell, I came across
an cxcerpr of discussions of fraternities and sets
rorities over a oentnry ago, \Vhat refreshed my
mind was not only that Grlnnell has never ole
lowed such groups on campus, but also more im.
portantly, why they are not allowed.

On decidingagainst the establishment oftra.
temitirs/sororities, ourcnnncll “fordathus” have
not denied their beneﬁts, but their contern was the possibility of
diseriminarion imposed by these gtoups. This decision once again
reinroreed the Grinncll tradition ofnonvdlscrlmlnarloli—one or
the many things that make both Grinnellians and outsiders ap—
preciate and respect Grinncll.

Sadly, the proud Grinnell tradition of nondiscrimination is
not being acknowledged by, no others but the student Govern.
ment Association In a recent meeting of the SGA Executive
CommitteelSept. 22), orwhich I am part of, President Ford, Sena.
tor sprecht, and I have discussed the selection proeess ofstudents
who apply to host the Trustees who have volunteered to stay over.
night in residence halls. Ford has brought up that students living
in doubles, triples, or quads should receive preferences over stu
dents living in singles, I immediately asked whether students liv»
ing in singles would be considered at all. Ford then suggested that
he would consider studene living in singles on the same floor
applying as a group a possibility in leveling preferences students in
doubles, triples, or quads may receive.

shortly after, in Joint Board meeting on 9/24/01, Ford, chair»
man or the Executive Committee, announced that the double/
triple/quad preference WILL BE glvtnia decision he has made
without Informing members ofthe Committee. When I inquired
the status or the proposal or students living on the same ﬂoor
applying as a group, Ford simply dismissed and said that he would
only give preferenee to students in doubles, triples, and quads,
reasoning that in sueh way, daeTrttstee would get the makimum
cxposur: to sludenrsi

Ford's decision on giving prererenee to stiidents in doubles,
triples, and quads usentially means discrimination to students in
singles who apply. As a Grilmellian and SGA senator from Norris,
I feel a personal responsibility to defend the proud Grinnell rmdl»
tion or iioirdiserimination I resent tliis unfair decision against
students in singles who wish to host Trustees.’ he rationale that
Tiietees would get more exposure to students if he/she be hosted
in doubles, triples. or oaads is illogical. This rationale also implies
that the room where theTrustees will stay will be the central acllV»
ity area of the 'l‘rustees. I believe Trustees who are willing to go
such distance as to stay in residence halls overnight would be will.

Films Chair responds

I am concerned, as I have been the past three years, with the
ﬁlm reviewers charaeteriaations of projectionlsts for the weekend
rilms. As a former proiectionist. I understand well the pressures of
every showing; though I may have setup everything correctly, the
ﬁlm may have been earlier loaded improperly or the reels may not
have been rcwound before daey arrive at orinnell. This results in
scenes iumping duringa showing ora movie playing upsidedown.
our corps orproiectionists works diligently each weekend to en.
sure that the moview you see are a perfect as we can make them.
That is one reason we continue last year's experiment of preview.

this is sometimes an inconvenieneo for the rew who attend, it en.

It is importanr to note that we work harder than a movi: the.
atet. Wereas they have on print which they show hundreds ortimes
(during which they can eorrect any imperfections), we show rivo
difrcerent films even/weekend, and have only three chances to get
it right It is often because we depend on others to have done their
jobs eovrreetly_at other schools aeross the country with student
stairs just like ours—that sueh mistakes happen As Films Chair, I
work elosely with the distributors to eliminate these problems,

than a movie theater, your pop and popcorn are free.
