Posse Plus-
brings new,
perspectives

BY KATHERINE CHUNG

Filling four charter buses, 155 Grinnellians
and 30 faculty and staff members departed on
Friday afternoon for the annual Posse Plus Re-
treat held in Des Moines.

The Posse foundation, founded in 1989, is
a nonproﬁt organization that selects “Posses”
ofloelz students from a number oflarge cities
around the country Each Posse undergoes an
eight month pie-collegiate training program
that prepares Posse Scholars to become leaders
at their respective colleges and universities and
promote cross-cultural communication.

Each year, Grinnell’s Los Angeles and Dise
trict of Columbia Posse Scholars invite meme
bers of the College community for a weekend
of discussion on contemporary events. This
year’s topic, "race after Obama," addressed
the question, “Do we still need to tallt about
race?" The question was somewhat rhetorical,
as attendees spent the weekend exploring the
meaning of race, from its implications to how
each individual experiences race,

Lauren Bacon ’10, a LA. Posse Scholar,
described the structure of die retreat as an up-
side down triangle, “You start off talking about
the topic generally and as the weekend goes on
it gets deeper and deeper and at the very tip
of the triangle, it’s all What it means to you,"
said Bacon.

The idea of “safe space," the foundation
of the retreat, stresses the importance ofcon‘
ﬁdentiality, challenging ideas and not people
and thoughtful listening. Creating a safe space
was especially important for this year’s discus
sion of race, a controversial topic.

. “I think one of the hardest things about
this race retreat is the fact that you’re asking
people, ‘how do you perceive me?" said panda
BarrioseCamacho ’12, a Posse Scholar and In-
tern .“The whole notion of really subtle racism,
the fact that people have different expectations
of you based on the way you look, that’s not
something that we share in the open [usually]."

This year, the retreat saw the largest nums
ber of faculty and staff attendees since its
founding, something thatJudy Hunter, a Posse
Mentor and Director of the Writing Labora-
tory, saw as a critical addition.

“[‘I‘he retreat] gives staﬂ’ and faculty 2
chance to interact with students in a way that
they don’t get to ordinarily," said Hunter. “It's
about listening to the student voices in a situ—
ation where it isn't the professor in power in
front of the classroom and students sitting in
the chairs. The meeting takes place on a more
level basis and I think that’s a really valuable
thing,"

Posse Scholars can invite two to three
guests a piece to attend the retreat, invitees
otherwise known as Posse Plus.

“Whenever we invite people to the Posse-

Plus Retreat, it’s a way of introducing them
win a wayihome," Barrios-Camacho said.
"Because we’ve all lived in the same place and
our trainers are really important people to us."

During the retreat, Posse Scholars and in-
vitees termed new relationships and strengths
ened existing ones, whether through meals,
activities or small group discussions, according

New, diverse senator group represents College,

Joint Board brings students from more backgrounds than previously

Bv CAROLIN ScHoLz

This semester’s . group of SGA Joint
Board Senators is more diverse than ever be
fore. Traditionally composed of white males,
this stereotype does not hold true this see
mester.

“We have a very diverse group ursenators
this semester," said SGA President Harry
Krejsa ’10.“It reﬂects the cam-
pus more accurately.”

This semester, Joint Board
consists of 12 nonsmale stun
dents, three domestic students
of color, three international
students and eight underclass»
men, according to Krejsa.

In contrast, in the spring of
2008, the College’s joint Board
consisted of28 members, 27 of
whom were white, according

. to an article in the 4/25 issue of the 3633.
This history of senators being white, male
upperclassmen has been defeated by a group
of senators that seems to reﬂect the College
more accurately. -

"Previously it has mainly been a bunch of
white guys, few girls and very few minorir
ties," said jamaland Senator Chris Dorman
’12.

“There are deﬁnitely more different ma-
jors and ethnicities than usual represented
this year," said OffsCampus Senator Liting
Cong’l 1, an international student from Chis
ha, and a third term senator.

As to how it came that this year's senators

are unusually diverse, no one can say.

“We’ve tried very hard to make sure that
all campus constituencies felt that they were
welcome in SGA, and that they, too, felt like
they had a view worth representing at Joint
Board," Krejsa said. '

Canada Senator and intended Biology
major Kathy Anders
sen '13, goes a little bit
further.

“I thought that
female re resenta-
tion on the GA was
needed," Andersen
said.

With 28 Candis
dates, this year’s elecr
tion was one of the
most competitive yet.

"The elections in
general were much more competitive this
year, and I think that added to the diverse
background," said Senator of East Campus
Alexander White ‘12, "It pushed the best to
the top.”

In fact twice as many candidates as spots
were available ran in the clusters of East,
Canada and Clangrala. It demonstrates how
much more people were willing to get ins
volved in campus politics this year.

“I wanted to get involved because I want
to give something back to the Grinnell cam-
pus," said Senator tor East campus Charity
Porotesano ‘12, from American Samoa. “I’d
like to make Grinnell more of II home for

everyone."

“I want to get international students on
campus more involved in the campus," said
Smounker Senator and international student
Shivani Santoki ’11. “As president of ISO
[International Student Organization] I have
noticed that a lot of the time, the internas
tionals are barely if at all involved in Campus
politics,"

In the past it has been unusualfor inter-
national students to be directly involved in
campus politics. This has deﬁnitely changed
this year, with three international students
being elected.

“I drink it may have something to do
with the new presidential search, that people
want to get more involved than usual,” said
Senator of Loosehead Colleen Osborne ’13.
“I wanted to run because there are definitely
things I would like to change."

Though the senators come many diners
ent backgrounds, all agree on one point—
every student, especially those who are not
currently serving on SGA, should be more
involved in campus politics and that there is
room for improvement in the dialogue be
tween students and administration.

“I want to improve the dialogue between
the students and the administration,"said Ja-
maland Senator Graziela Guzman ‘11. “Be-
cause 1 think there is a general feeling ornot
being advocated for among the studentsl
know I felt that way before I ran as a senae
tor. “
