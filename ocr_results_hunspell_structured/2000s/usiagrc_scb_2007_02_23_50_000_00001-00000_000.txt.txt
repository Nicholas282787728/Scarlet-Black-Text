Dems mobilize,
initiative passes

BY CHrus NEUBERT

on Monday, Gr-innell snidents voted overwhelmingly in
favor of a resolution that opposes President Bush’s proposal
to send 21,500 additional troops to Iraq. The resolution, prer
sented to the student bodv as an “emergency student initiative,’
was passed by a vote of 534 to 119 with 53 35% ofrhe eligible
student body voting. The initiative the latest incarnation ofa
resolution originally presented to Joint Boai,d |S p1rt ofa laiger
campaign staited by the C1mpus Deinociats and the Voice-
box to alert Grinnell's congressional representation of campus
views

The emergency initiative represents the latest twist in the
Campus Dcms’ campaign to get Grinneu to rake some action
in opposition of tlte proposed troop increase The initiative
came after Joint Boaicl decided not to vote on the initial mo,

Alec schierenbeck'09, tllc' 've was passed at an “especially
critical inomcnt”before the Senate reached a decision on their
own resolution.

schiercnbeck said he is particularly hopeful that Repub-
lican Senator Chuck Grassley will take note of the results in
Grinnell and across the state, since “he is part of a coalition
blocking a vote on the Senate resolution."

The initiative has had much more of an impact on campus,
however, since sponsors of the emergency initiative invoked an
obscure clause in the constitution. Accotding to Administra—
tive Coordinator Nick Bleneowe '08, this initiative iequited a
petition erzoo signatures and the applo‘ml orpresident Chris
Hall ’07 in order to be presented to the student body.

Unlike other initiatives, though, the emergency initia-
tive did not require a majority turnout in order to be valid. stu-

Increasing disability awareness

BY NORA CooN

When Amanda Octet-1’09 and Leah Krandcl '09 began to
bccomc concerned about lllC accesolnility of campus to [IVOSD
with disabilities, they did not pi-orcst with signs or write memos
to campus groups. Instead. they produced a terrrrninute video
chronicling Ktandel’s simulated attempts to maneuver aiound
Grinnell college in a wheelchair, and posted it on i'ou'rube.
com with the title “Accessible Grinncll." Within five clays, the
video had been ’viewed almost 1,000 times.

Beginning last weekend, the Ad Hoc Committee on Disr
ability hosted' its second annual Dis1bilily Awareness Week. a
week long series of speakers, ﬁlms, and displays designed to
iaise awaieness about disability issues in and around Grinnell
college.

Sevcml snidents and faculty, like Kl'ilndcl and Gotera, have
also Worked to highlight specific areas on campus where acces-
sibility is lacking.

Grinnell look bad, but simply to make suie students know that
Grinnell still has inaccessible aspects of campus.

Ralph savarese, English, Co—Chait ol'Grinnell's Commit
tee on Disability along with Klandel, said that while there is
srill work to be done, the administration is making progress “I
absolutely applaud the administration for thinking so progres-
sively," Sal/arose said,“but we can't test on out laurclst"

He cited the new suites in Cowles as a promising step for-

Competing for profs in rural Iowa

Last year, when their top candidate rejected their offer of
a new political theoiy position, the Political Science Depart”
ment was forced to scrap the entire processl‘his year the His
tory Department had more luek in filling its opening {or rtn
American History position, recently announcing the hiiing of
Albert Lacson from Macalester college. Despite the critical
importance and relative frequency of faculty recruitment and
selection. a process dcscribed by Victoria Brown, History, as
“cumbersome. bureaucratic" and “hellish,” outsiders are largely
ignorant of the process.

According to Jim Swarrz, Dean of the College and Vice
President for Academic Affairs, the college is undergoing an
unusually large number ortenuie trick searches this year which
has taxed the time and attention of numerous departments.

In order to add new raculty, a department must go through
a lengthy process. A department begins by placing a request

one potential challenge faced by Griiinell in its search
for new ficulty is that the college places a heavier emphasis

Swartz said that ”it's important for Grinnell to be distinctive in
