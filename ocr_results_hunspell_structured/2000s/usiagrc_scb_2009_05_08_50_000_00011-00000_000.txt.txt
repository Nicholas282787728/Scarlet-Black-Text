said he' is not worried about
Mike Goldﬂen in the teams seeding in the
tournament. He said a win
against St, Norbert College
would put the Pioneers in a great position to win the tournament.

“Ifyou win the first game, you only play tiuee games in two days,
as opposed to ﬁve ifyou lose the ﬁrst game,"I-I<>llibaugh said. “So it’s
a big advantage pitching wise to win the first"

Hollibaugh’s squad had an impressive regular season, with a
record of 2242 overall and sea in conference play, rhe men have
already ser a single season record for wins According ro Captain
Chad Takabuki '10. the Pioneer's success arises out of strong team
chemistry

"It takes time for 30 players to come together to work towards
[making conferenceL" Mark Wilcox ’09 said. "It feels great to be re-
loaded for countless hours of hard wot "

Takahuki is also impressed with rhe progress of rhe team as a
unir, noting rhat no group of positions has singlehandedly carried
the team to its winning record

”We are performing at our highest level," Takabuki said. "Our
whole ﬁeld presence has been amazing because all ofus are so dose
together"

Hollibaugh said thar three years ago, rho class of ’05 helped srart
a process that created this ymr’s strong team chemistry

"Since on senior class came in, the [class of’05 players] did a
good job of integrating the ﬁrst—years into our team,” Hollibaugh
said. “And since then, there's been more ofan emphasis on having
everyone feel like their involved.

Getting the ﬁrst—years involved has been a major factor in the
success of the team this year. Mike Nodrenski ’12 leads the confer
ence in home runs with eight, including an incredible three home
run game against Illinois College.

“Mike is arguably the best hitter in our conference nght now,"

Ryan Fletcher '11 said of Nodzenski. “Not many turns want to
pitch to him because he’s hitting bombs pretty much every time he‘s
up to bat it seems."

As the team travels to De Pere, they hope that their team chem-
istry and the work they've put in this season will pay our.

“The expectation is that we’ll be able to compete vvith whomever
we play,“ Goldﬁen said. “We have a great team and good leader
ship from our upperelassmen, so I think we can do very well this

weeken ."

After foul first day, Grinnell Golf rallies to place fourth

BYJAI GARG

This past weekend, the men’s golfceam crave
eled to Rockford IL to compete in the MWC
Championship Despite shooting the best two
round score in the tournament over Saturday
and Sunday, the team failed to capture the crown
and ﬁnished fourth.

“Obviously we went there with the inten-
cons of winning, untorrnnnrely we had a bad
first day that was too much to overcome," Alex
McDonald ’11 said “We did our best to fight
back the last two days but I’d say fourth place
me a little disappointing."

During the ﬁrst day of the tournament the
team shot a cumulnrive 331 placing them sev-
enth out of the eight- team ﬁeld and 17 strokes
behind eventual champion Monmouth College.

Grinnell ﬁnished with a team score of 956, 13
strokes behind conference champion Mon-
mouth.

“It reallywasn't anybody’s fault, it was a team
effort in the collapse,” CorCaptain Pete Kiesclr
bach '10 said. “Nobody played well on day one
and we buried ourselves in a hole we could not
get outoﬁ”

Despite finishing fourth, the team did play
well overall and had a couple of excellent lndr
vidual performances. Kieselbach led the Pioneers
with a threerday score of231 and had the fourth
highest individual score in the tournament. Next
for the Pioneers wits McDonald with a threerday
score of 240 placing him twelfth overall, But in
the end the Individual accomplishments were
not enough

“You are not going ro get ro nationals as an
indhn‘dual. you only gcr rhcrc as a team." Peter
Marsho '11 said, who shot 250 to place 24th
overall. “Mark Train from Illinois College [who
had the lowest individual score] blow through
the field but his team ﬁnished eighth, so he isn't
going to Nationals."

Though the ream finished fourm, the dy—
namics otthe tenrn rhis year pushed them to have
one ofthcii best seasons in recent memory.

"In years pasr we did not have people who
took the team sci iously, we only had six to eight
golfers who even wanted to play," Kiesclbach
said. “This season we had 15 guys and every
single one ofthem cared about how the team did
and showed up to practice everyday.

Looking forward to next year, the team will

be losing its emotional leader in R] Roewe ’09,
who shot a 246 over the weekend.

”RI is irreplaceable in the sense that he is
great at fostering team chemistry," McDonald
said. “I feel like I have leamed a lot from and I
am going to try and conu‘nue on What he has
done."

Despite losing Roewc to graduation, the
prospects for the team look very bright for next
season. Four ofrhe top five seornswill be return-
ing and rhcre will be a lor otcompctirion for the
six conference spots,

“With rhe guys that we have returning there
is reason to be optimistic,” Kieselbach SLllCi. “I
rhink we have a high ceiling for next year and
look across the board and I see nothing but posir
lives for next year."

Favre not worth the media or mediocrity

1m giving up on the NFL. At aViking s fan,ldontthrnk1
can handle it anymore The 1998 NFC Championship game.
Korey Stringer dying, the Nate Poole game, the Sex Bout lnClT
dentithose are things I can handle I Will not. cannot handle
Brett Favre under center for the Vikings.

It’s speculation now, bur all signs are pointing to MinnCr
sota signing the old gunslingcr Now, 1 don't rhink quarter-
backs Tarvaris Jackson or sage
Rosentcls are all thar good-but
they don't cause rhe onslaught
of media attention that makes
you abhor a team, I dont want
the Vikings to draw the atten-
rion Favre will give them. The
constant segments on some of
the worst sports-related shows
on television, the lionrstop “expert” commentary on everything
he docs—it will be insufferable, Thank God John Madden res
tired.

Let’s completely disregard the insane media attention and
how horrible Farve was down the stretch last year, throwing
seven interceptions and just two touchdowns in his final five
games with the Jets, ultimately leading the team to a 1-4 re-
cord as they stumbled out ofplayoffconrcntion. Let’s disregard
hrs possibly torn bicep thar rakes away the only thing he ever

had going for him that crinnon rhats attached ro his right arm,
Let's even disregard the fact that he’ll tllrn 40 in October. How
am I supposed to root for someone l'vo hatred for so long?

The thing is, I don't rruly hare many sports figures I might
whine about Drew Pearson pushing offm the 1975 NFC Divi-
sional playoff game, but that did happen over ten years before 1
was born, so any actual malice towards Mr. Fealson is fabiicated

for my own masochistic enjoys
mcnt. For a while, I would get
visibly upset tit the mention
of Carl Pohald, owner of the
Twins, but once the contracr
tron idea fell through and he
actually started putting some
of his immense wealth back
into the roam, my anger sub-
sided, I even felt bad when he died earlier this year. I never
thought that would be the case.

And although I did hate Chuck Knoblauch for a while, it’s
hard not to feel sorry for him after he got Steve Bliiss syndrome,
ruining the career of one of the ﬁnest second baseman of our
generation. on a similar note, as much as I may bash hrm.1srill
would have loved to have DerekJeter its my shortstop for most
ofthc past decade, even ifhe can't go to his left, Brett Favre is
maybe the only sports figure I truly hate, besides Norm Green,

who, as owner of the Minnesota North Stars. sold the team to
Dallas] hope he gets run over by a Zamboni,

My initial instinct when 1 see Favre drop back ro pass is
to hope a defensive lineman hns him so hard he spits up his
Vicodin. I want his annoying wishyswashy. fake “aw, sliucks"
attitude as faraway from my team as possible

Sure. most ofhisjob would be to hand the b ill offru Ches-
ter Taylor and Purple Jesus (Adrian Peterson to those who
arent followers), but we dont need an over-tlie- hill quarterback
who still thinks he can make every throw. Our defense is one of
the best in the league, and when you can just pound the ball all
game long, you can chew up large amounts ofclock. Ifwe were
going to bring in a 40 year-old quarterbackl would have much
rather preferred Jettcarcia.

IfFavie does end up signing with the Vikings, can I really
give up watching football? I enjoy the game immcnscly and it
comes in such small quantities that it’s possible I could srornach
him for three hours. 16,or hopefully more, Sundays at year. My
first reaction when he gets pummeled by a blitzing linebacker
from the blindsidc might be to chccr, bur eventually rhar could
wear off, And I do want to watch Adrian Peterson run the ball,
and Kevin Williams and Jared Allen Attack the quarterback.
There seems to be only one solution—have the remote ready,
and as soon as i see so much as a three step drop, switch over to
whatever movie Oakland Raiders fans are watching,
