“We war: oddities," said June: Poland '68, recalling the semester sht-
and seveml orher crinnelllnns spenr at LeMoyne College, on all-Black
school in Memphle,’renn “We on very eonsplenons, we really srond out,
but we were welcomed. "

Grinneil College m 2002 mlgl‘n nor be the most melnlly diverse plnee
in thc U.S.. but hard as It is to imagine. In the late 1960:, some White
smdenrs had never mer e Blzck parson. And in the urban Memphis neigh-
borhood what surrounded LcMoync Callzge. Now ullcd LcMovncAOwcn,
the reverse was true.

“I’d never been anywhere where Black people lived," totalled Amy
Rossman ’68. who, like Poland, took elosses nt LeMoyne (luring the spring
of 1966.

“leoil were a \Whitc suburban person," Poland said, “you really didn't

have nny oppornmiry to nln into people from dlrrerem backgrounds "
When rhe ﬁve Grinncll students who pnrdetpered m the ptogmm
that semesrer mrlved In Memphrs, rhey were struck by horh rho heenry
of rhe LAMoync enmpns and rho poveny orrhe surrounding ores.
“Certainly rural loWs doesn't suggest great wcalth," Said Poland,
“but urbnn Memphis was n shock. It was very rundown."
Most of LeMoyne's students lived in the ciiy itself and toms
muted to classes, but the Grinn:ll students and the LeMoyne bas-
kctbnll team lwed on-campus. conseonenrly, many of rho
thnmllians' friends were basketball players.
Rossmnn recalled that. in the sryle ofthnncll srudenrs trying to
shock people, me Whne women in rhe :xchange would display open
affection for their Black male friends in public,

Poland said the mood orehe civil rights movement was shifting at

rhe time, and mnny people drdm know where rhey stood. “We wcle

Although n 1966 women bycxchangc ponielpsnrs snel lehloyne

were able m ﬁnd chullcnging nendernie experience: there. Poland took a
class on Ammnhme. icon hisrory, which nns not svoilshle 2n Grinncll at
rhe rime. Rossman srndied microbiology in “oneotrhe mm! exciting eon.ses
I‘d ever mien," and ended up going into rher Field. She now works for rhe
umred smees oepnrrmenr ongricultutc (USDA) as rhe resenreh lender
ore laboratory that smdles fungi.

The exchange forced srndenrs to think nhonr difﬁcult isstlts—such n
how rhey identiﬁed themselves. Rossman remembered living with a
LeMoyne professor who was nlso n lone othonse .norher, who “would nsh
qnemons like, ‘Who do you consider yonreem Arc yon White? Are you
fernslez What do you eonsrder yonr let-mine”

Meny orrhe Grinnell smelenrs heel nemr consciously thought noonr

Perhaps rhe mosr striking sspeer orrhe experience was discovering rhe
