Wanted: formidable and hate-able opponent

BYJAI GAuG

Rcmembcr getting popped up the night
before for the football game against Gi'innell’s
big iival? Or how the stands were packed
when the Pioneer men's basketball team hit
that bill r bcaicr against the hated sortindrso.
ihc stands cleared, and everyone stuck around
afterwards to celebrate? y

otcouisc you don't. we don't have a team
like rhar tor Gnnueli, an opponent rhar all
Grinncllians could despise. Franldy, it’s hard
to get excited for games against Illinois Col—
lege, Knox or Lake Forest.

Bur what if it was reality, and Grinnell had
that rival for every sport?

The week before a big game, a new sense or
life would spread across th ‘itmpus. Students
cars would be painted with “Go Pioneers.”
The dining hall would be a sea of scarlet and
black on the day or the game. People might
even tailgate!

Realistically, this kind of enthusiasm is a
pipe dream for Grinnell sports, but an exciting
one nonetheless.

“A rival would deﬁnitely increase school
awareness about sporting events”, said Malt
colm Scott ’11. “Some students would even
travel to nearby away games.”

As any fan whose team has a huge rival
knows, every conversation with a {an of the
opposing team often involves more debate
over whose school is better than whose foot—
ball or basketball team is better. For instance,
every Northwestern fan knows that an Illinois
grad will he “working for them someday" or
that some Red Sox fans hate Yankees fans as
much as the team itself.

A rival could bring out that kind ofschool
spirit. “I think that it would be really good to
get people pumped to go to sporting events,"
said Julia Reese '10, especially given the “nega
tive connotation towards students who play
sports at this school.”

There are several hurdles that come in
the way of Grinnell having a consistent rival,
though. “Many of the schedules tor our sporrs

teams are made up one to three years in ad
Vance", said Athletic Director Greg Wallace.
“We would have to go around our conference
schedules to make that happen

However, last year the athletic directors
of the Associated Colleges of the Midwesti
which includes schools from the Midwest
Conference as well as other Grinnell academic
rivals like Carleton and Macalester—met
in Chicago to discuss the distinct possibility
of scheduling more games within the ACM.
“Our best chance is the ACM," said Greg
Wallace, “whether it be individual matches or
more tournaments."

A new schools might come to mind for
Grinnell rivals, but only one truly has rival po
tential: Carleton, our US anl ranking rival to
the north. Many Grinnell students make the
choice between here and Carleton, (some even
come here because Carleton rejected them)
and our rivalry could produce a number of

unique arguments.

“The kids at Carleton are very socially
awkward," said Maia Larson '11, who actu
ally is from Norrhfield, Minn. Think ofall the
cheers we could make up for that.

Carleton also has fewer students on ﬁnanr
cial aid compared to Grinnell. According to
the College Board, less rhan 50 percent ofthc
students receive ﬁnancial aid, resulting in a less
diverse atmosphere and an attitude otrlltism.

Then there's just pure hatred,\vhich already
seems to exist. When asked what he thought
ofCarletonJohn Burrows ’10 responded with
a hearty “Carleton? THEY SUCKl"

So imagine: Carleton strolls in to Darby
gyrn, proud and boastful, only to he met by a
wagon train of Pioneers and sear down a rrail
of tears back to the wasteland of Northﬁeld,
Minn. Clichéd and ridiculous? You bet. But
doesn't it sound better than what we have
now?

Who to hate? '
The Top Candidates

1. CarletoniIt's obvious. We‘re com-
petitors. almost everyone knows someone
who goes there, and they would be easy to
hatc. Can we start scheduling them for mar
jor sports soon, please:

2. Macalester—Doesn’t quite match
up with Glinnell and Carleton in rhe us.
New: battle, but they're another elite Liberal
arts college in the vicinity Plus their football
team is terrible, and a wins a win, especially
against a rival.

3. Beloit— Ifwc must pick a conference
foe, it might as well be this one. They're
located closer than most ch teams,
and people still have to be bitter that they

‘ In last week's MLB Playoff Preview, all
three 388 staffers mistakenly predicted that
the Chicago Cubs would advance to theWorld
Series. In fact, two out of three writers pre-
dicted that the Cubs would win their first title
in 99 years. While we couldn't have predicted
that Cubs power hirrers would do nothing
in the series. any selfrrespecting sportswriter
should have known that the Cubs are, well,
the Cubs, an 85 win team from a terrible divi-
sion that often had trouble reaching any level
of consistency. Our optimism was premature
and, to the Cubs haters on campus, undouhtr
edly hilarious. The 583 regrets the error, and
the Cubs fans on staff will patiently wait until
next year.
