It’s been an upsnndsdown road for the fast-paced
Pioneer women’s basketball team so far this season.
Last Saturday, a solid start fell apart as the Grinncll
lost to Illinois College 79450 in its first Midwest Cons
ference gnrne ofthe year. But on Wednesday, Grinnell
reversed a three-game skid with an 88-63 victory over
Cornell College at Mt. Vernon.

“We’re making some technical errors, and I would
attribute most of those to making a move from more
traditional basketball to rip-tempo basketball," said
coach Andy Hamilton ‘85 following the Illinois Col»
lege game.

Grinnell will close out play for this semester with
a game Saturday at 2 p.m. in Fella against 2—5 Central
College. Tomorrow’s game will he the first the Pie»
neers have played within three hours of Grinnell, but
those unable to make the drive can hear the game live
on KGRN 1410 AM.

“We have to get used to the road games, because
that's all we're playing the ﬁrst halfofrhe season," said
Hannah Wolf‘08.

Grinneil, which put together a splendid road
record last season, ﬁnally put together a dominat—
ing performance on the road, riding 19 points from
Lindsay Peter ‘06 and a pressing defense that forced
36 Corndl turnovers. Saturday night was a different
story, however.

In a closely played first half against the Lady
Blues. Grinnell pulled out to a 40~30 lead with 2:34
left, and led 43-40 at halftime. Illinois College's Kris-
ten Endress nailed a three pointer with 1Az32 to put
the Lady Blues up 4847. From that point on,Illinois
College outscored Grinnell 31,13 to seal the victory

“I was disappointed with how the game turned
out. I think we came out ﬂat in the second half after
playing a very good first half.” said Wolf.

fore picking up a victory at Cornell; Central College is next

One reason for the turnaround was the Pioneers’
cold shooting from behind the arc. While Griunell
hit 10 of23 threespointers in the first half, all 21 shots
hoisted in the second half missed the mark. “I really
don't have an answer for why we didn’t shoot well,”
Hamilton said.

The Lady Blues, on the other hand. made 8 oflb
three point attempts in the game, but funneled much
of their offense through post player Lisa Imel, who
scored a game-high 20 points.

“Weer not very big inside and Illinois College
shot the ball well," Hamilton said.

Overall, the Lady Blues outscored the Pioneers
30710 in points in the paint and held a 39-27 re-
bounding edge.

Katy Bowen ‘06 and Maddy Raimondo ‘08 paced
the Pioneers with 8 points,with Lindsay Peter‘OS and
Wolf scoring seven. Bowen also added four rebounds
and four assists, but had four turnovers and fouled out
with three minutes left to play.

Looking ahead, Grinnell will have a busy January,
playing seven games before spring semester classes
begin, including six games against conference oppm
nents.

None are as highly anticipated as the Jan. 21
matchup against Lawrence, which will be the ﬁrst
game in the new Darby Gymnasium. “We're work
ing hard to get through those road games," Hamilton
said, “and looking forward to getting home to the new
Dar y."

Hamilton thinks that the teams play will be imr
proving. "With our new upstempo style of play, we’re
still working the kinks out," he said. “I still believe
that we have the firepower and the leg power to make
rhis type ofbasketball work for us, I think it's only a
matter oftime for us to see the positive results."
