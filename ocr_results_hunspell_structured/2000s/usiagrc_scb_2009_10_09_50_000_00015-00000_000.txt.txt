Volleyball playing for Conference Tournament

BY ELIZABETH PEARCE

With a new head coach and only three
incoming freshman, the Grinnell Volleyr
ball team underwent significant changes
this year, seemingly for the better. The Pio-
neers have already achieved two more wins
than last year with 11 games left this year.

Their win on Tuesday against fellow
conference member Monmouth added to
their record to make it 912. After wins
ning the ﬁrst game, the team lost games
two and three of the set, but the women
pulled through to win the final two games
and thus the match.

“We knew we could beat them, because
we’d done it before,” Head Coach Jackie
Hutchison said. “It was just a matter of
coming out and doing that,"

One thing contributing to this ability
to maintain their focus and win difficult
games like Tuesday’s is the increased sense
of togetherness the team feels this year.

“I think in general we're a lot more co-
hesive," Olivia Wilks ’12 said.

This camaraderie contributed to more
team communication.

“our mental focus is really showing
through this year,” Claire Reeder ’11 said.
"We’ve been communicating well, which is
a very mature team dynamic.”

Hiitchison credits the senior women,
Caroline Bailey, Carlie Beach, Muriel Gals
lo-Chasanoff and Caitlin Helcrline for a
considerable portion ofthis team unity.

“They provide incredible leadership
both on and offthe court and keep every-
one inspired,” Hutchison said.

Although few in number, the first years
have also contributed to the team's success.

“The first years this year are an exam

ple of how, as one person grows, the entire
team grows,” Hutchison said.
“They’re so confident and willing to

play wherever needed,"Wilks said.

Reeder, Wilks and Hutchison all ems
phasized the contribution of each member
to the team's overall success, however.

"It is apparent to me that all of the
women on the team have gotten here be—
cause of their hard work,” Hutchison said.
"I see my role as a way to get them to see
that bringing out the best in yourself brings
out the best in someone else"

All members of the team participate in
the games, whether their role is to play on
the court or to keep the players pumped up
from the sidelines.

“Whether you’re on the court or on the
bench, you’re just as much a part of the
team,"VVilks said.

Four teams from the conference get to
attend these Midwest Conference Champi-
onships on Nov. o-7.The women have been
preparing for this tournament all season.

“From day one, we have been visualizing
ourselves in the conference meet and that’s
really been our guiding goal," Reeder said.

Based on the team’s season so fat,
Hutchison has high hopes for the confer-
ence tournament.

“The championship is a completely
achievable goal," Hutchinson said,

The team hopes to use their two home
games this weekend to continue to bolster
their record. The women play Ripon Col-
lege at 7 pm. on Friday and Carroll College
at 1 p.m.

“The x-factor in our games is so much
being at home, and I think that's ii credit to
everyone here," Reeder said,

The team’s record at home is 6-4. Both
of these upcoming games are conference
games, which will help to decide whether
or not Crinnell will have a top four spot in
the conference and attend the champion
ships.

BYMAX CALENBERG

Grinnell golfers soldiered through tough cold
conditions on Friday and Saturday of the Mid-
west Conference (MVVC) Tournament, but when
the sun came out on Sunday, the Pioneers shined
with it,

The Gnnnell Women’s Golf ream concluded
their season last Sunday with a second place ﬁn-
ish out of seven teams at the Midwest Conference
Championship held at Aldeen Golf Course in
Rockford, Ill, Carroll College won the tournament
by 26 strokes, and both Grinnell and Carroll def“?
ed lilinois College which had won the tournament
for last six years. The Pioneers ended their season
with a 15th place finish out of19 teams at the Mil-
likin Fall Classic on Sept, 2677 in Decatur, Ill.

The trio of first )emwMolly Messin '13,
Natalie Klee'13, and Elizabeth Burnett'lE—cach
shot individual tournament bess of 82, 87 and 86
on the final day.

The team placed second last year, imd Coach
David Arsenault believed his team Vl’ﬂs capable of
taking home the victory this year.

“A second place conference ﬁnish is not what
we had hoped for,"Arscnault wrote in an email.
“But Carroll was every hit as good as we were and
the conference tournament was a toss up."

Messin claimed second out of roughly so
golfers overall. with a zoo after three rounds.
Klee took seventh by shooting a 285, and Burnett
placed runth, with a 288. All three golfers earned
alleleague honors for dieir top 10 ﬁnishes. For the
remainder of the Team Captain Ashlen Malzdorf
’11,ﬁmshed14th,ElaineTeo’12 Came in 25th and
Evelyn Anderson ’12 landed in 29th place.

Matrdorf has been incredibly impressed with
the ﬁrst years’ perfonnance this season.

“There's a different level ofinrensity to [coir
lcgiate golf],"Matzdorfsaid. “They have handled
the transition very well."

Besides the intimidating athletic atmosphere,
Klee notes another aspect that makes the jump
challenging.

“The college courses are alot harder than high
school,”l£lee said.

Transitions aside, die Pioneers are a very
young team. Wim every member returning next
year, Coada Aisenault envisions a promising fir
ture for the women. Accordingly he has set his
goals higher for next season.

“My goal for next year is to win the conference
championship and get this group to nationals."
Arsenaultwrote,

To achieve this, Coach Arsenaidt is schedule
ing tournaments for the squad in the spring to
give them more oﬁrseason training.

“We are taking the golfprogram up a compet-
itive notch,"Arsenanltwrote.“In order to compete
with the better teams in the Midwest, you must
pinyin the spring."

Elaine Teo ’12 agrees with coach's strategy for
the spring,

“Last year, we didn’t have a spring schedule,"
Teo said, "It will be more investment and effort,
but it will be good for us."

In addition to the min training, Arsenault
hopes to bring some more talent into the program
through recnuting in order to overcome the cons
sistently challenging MWC foes.

“We need at least one more lmv 805 player to
give ourselves a shot at the conference side next
year, because 1 know lllinois Coliege will be back
and Carroll will only be gening better," Arsenauh
wrote.

Although the conference tournament didn’t
turn out quite as the Pioneers had hoped, the ca-
maraderie ofrhe team has come together.

“Vi/c sort of balance each other out,”Teo said.
"It's so hard to explain, butifyou see us together it
makes sense~I love my team."

Lake Forest] is a good testament to the fact we have some depda in our
program.“

up daroughout the season.

able for their positions,” Coach Hamilton said. "Each of the victories,
it has come from digerent people in different positions, in tennis it
is sometimes about match-ups, we have been able to use our positive
match ups for some victories."

yama added,

"I am incredibly pleased that this group ofwomen have a been able

ing on one individual, all the individuals are working hard on their own
performance which collectively makes us a pretty good team"l-lamilton
