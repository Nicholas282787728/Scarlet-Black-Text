Approximately 300 Afghan women protested against
marital rape laws against a background of a larger,
primarily male countcrrpmtest on Wednesday. Last
month, a law was passed that stated that a husband
could demand sex with his wife every four days unr
less she is ill or would be harmed by intercourswa
clause most critics say legalizes marital rape.Thc law
would apply to Shiites in Afghanistan, who make up
approximately ten percent of the population, Dur-
ing the protest, the much larger crowd consisting of
mostly men pelted the protesting women with small
stones. President Obama has called the law abhorrent
and many governments and rights groups have con-
demned the legislation.

Computer thefts strain ITS, Security

BY BRIAN SHERWIN

Since the first day ofspring hrcak, six computers and two
eciling projectors have been stolen trout rooms in the Robert
Noyce ’49 Science Center and the Alumni Recitation Hall.

The ﬂurry of missing computers and electronic equipment
are atypical ofa usually calm theft climate on campus.

“We've never had this happen beforbit’s usually once
every couple of years that one will get taken," said the Clean
Team Leader of the Information Technology Service (ITS)
Karen McRitchic.

According to McRitchic, the times and dates ofthe thefts
cannot be known with certainty. lTs was
not notiﬁed immediately at the time of
the disappearances, but instead teceived
individual reports as the computers were
noticed missing.

“We noticed the [disappearances]
trickling in. It’s always hard to know
when they were taken,"McRitchie said.

The uncommon surge of the thefts
has also created some concerns about res

- placing the stolen equipment.

“If this continues, we're not going to be able to replace
them this fasr,"Mchtchie said, citing budget cuts concurrent
with a campus—wide reduction ofopetating costs.

. Although little is known about the thefts, the incidents
have raised general concerns about building and computer sc-
curity.

”Not all ofour buildings are really locked during the day,’
Mchtchie said.

Director of Security Stcphen Briscoe expressed the possi-
bility ofincreasing security measures to reduce the likelihood
of theft. The possibilities focused largely around securing
Noyce, a building that is unlocked for a large portion of the
day and contains a high concentration orcomputers.

“Now should we lock [Noyce] down? Should we run
everybody out otthat building at 5 pm? These things are all
on the t2b1c,"Briscoc said.

Though ITS has increased efforts to secure computers
with hcnvyrduty cables, there are still problems that remain.

Green Team Leader of ITS

McRitchie said. “The publics [eomputcrs] have always been
cabled, but these [stolen ones] come from not so public areas,"
McRitcl-lie discussed how some of the thefts required the
use oftools to remove the cables, which secure the computers.
d“Two of the cables have actually been cut," McRitchie
sat .

The recent thefts include three Mac Minis, two iMacs,
one Mac laptop, and two ceiling projectors. according to
McRitchie, adding up to a total estimated replacement cost
upwards ot’sl4,ooo.

These current incidents recall two computer thefts at the
publications Office in December during
finals week,

“All I really know about the comput-
crs disappearing is thatl think it was on
Wednesday night or afternoon they were
last seen in the ofﬁce, and then I got an
c-mail late telling me that two of the
computers were gone, wondering if we
had taken them for maintenance,” said
SPARC Chair Christine McCormick '09.

Although there werc concerns, Mc-
Cormick cited a feeling ofsafety prior to the thefts.

“There are some security issues with this room, but I
guess we just assumed that computers are big enough they’d
be okay," McCormick said

According to McCormick,an increase in surveillance may
help to better monitor and secure the publications office.

“We talked with [Dean ofStudcnts] Travis Greene about
getting a p-card reader (or the door," McCormick said. “In
the old pubs building that’s on south campus there used to be
a p-card reader that was only open to media heads and editors
so that you could patrol who went in and Out ofthe building,”

With the plausibility of more thefts on campus, Briscoe
also supports an implementation of security cameras

“Ifl had a camera in some of the areas, I eould just go
back to some ofthe footage,"Briscoe said. “I wouldn’t have to
be sitting here viewmg the camera I could just go back to the
footage of the time span on when the crime occurred, look
through the video and come up with what happened."
