Allen’s independence sends her abroad

For some people, high school memories are best kept off-campus.
For Maddie Allen, though, she fondly remembers putting an her red,
white and blue cheerleading uniform and screaming at pep rallys.
“It's really fun being a cheerleader, it's like being a celebrity,”she
said. Her favorite part
of being a cheerleader
was putting on the
uniform on game days
and parading through
the halls, or screaming
at football games.
She still keeps her
cheerleading uniform in
her closet in hopes that no matter what happens to her, it’ll still ﬁt.
Along with her uniform she wears at Halloween Harris, she still
keeps one aspect ofcheerleader that's helped her at Grinnell,
“In high school,I never cared what people thought of me, and
that’s something I've tried to continue here.”
Allen thinks she’s remained true to her life motto while at school.
While she was abroad in Capetown, she had a choice to take her
final exams or to spend a week touring south Africa with her host
brother and his Olympic field hockey team.
"It was a once in a lifetime opportunity, ofcourse I was going to

take it," she said. She ended up failing two of her classes, and faced
repereussions from the college when she came back.

Even though she has to catch up on credits for her anthropology
and English double major, she doesn't regret the decision to tour
South Africa with her host brother.

“The registrar asked ifl was sorry and I was like ‘No,l had sex
with an Olympic athlete,"’ Allen said. "Academics and good life
choices don’t always go together."

During the summer of2008, she was able make a good academic
and life choice when she did a Mentored Assisted Project (MAP)
with anthropology professor Vicki Bently-Condit.

“It was great being on campus during the summer, and one ofthe
best parts was meeting Ryan Carlino,”Allen said.

After graduation, Allen plans to return abroad and teach English.
She still has to pass her Toesel exam, part of process to be able to
teach English overseas, but she views it as the next step in her life.

"I've always wanted to live abroad," she said. “When you're
studying abroad, you're not really living there, you're a studentl want
to be apart ofthe community where I live in another Country."

Allen has her eye on Istanbul, Turkey,

"Turkey has a huge demand for native English speakers, and I
want really cute men," she said. "we both have something for each
other."
