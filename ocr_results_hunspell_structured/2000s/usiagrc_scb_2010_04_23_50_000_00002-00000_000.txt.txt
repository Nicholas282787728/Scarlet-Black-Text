World Headlines

On Thursday, France's government announced that they
would apply a proposed ban on facercovetlng lslamle veils on
those visiting the region. as well as residents within the count
try. Junior family minister Nadine Morano said that under
the ban, visitors would have to “respcct the law" and uncover
their faces and French President Nicolas Sarkozy also stood
behind the public ban of the veil, also referred to as the burqa.
The cabinet is expected to review the draft bill sometime
next month. France’s highest court has warned the goverm
ment that a complete ban on the burqa could be unlawfulThe
French State Ombudsman, Jean—Paul Delevoye, has showed
concern that the law can result in difﬁcult situations in which
“policemen [are] running through the streets to pull veils off
women.” The government has promised that this will not be
the case, however. and that all of those who wear all-covering
veils would not be required to take them offon the spot, but
simply asked for their name and address so that the govern
ment could send them a warning and a fine.

Favorite memory (so far) ofGrinnell College: Oimutse,1
have to at least reference the infamous ice storm of2007, which
happened to be during my fitst experience in Iowa. Let's just
say 1 hind ofwanted to go home after that. My favorite meme
oty in Grinnell would have to be just the eoutacts and friends

social structure, culture, and style of people.
