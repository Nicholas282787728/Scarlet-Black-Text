There has been much talk of la’te
about an ethanol plant coming to our
fair city (this austere publication made
that its fimikpagc headline last week),
and it got

of the issue.

Many have
argued that ethanol has become such
a large industry here in Iowa more for
political reasons than environmental
or economic ones. So, while building
a plant in Grinnell is undeniably in
the shortsterm interests of our humble
hamlet and its economy, I thought this
week it might be interesting to examine
the politics behind corn-fed cars.

Whether or not the show’s depic-
tion of ethanol as the only important
issue to Iowa voters is accurate (and I
think the 2008 Caucuses will prove
that it isn’t), conventional political WIST
dom certainly says that it is. In 2000,
you may recall, senator John McCain's
campaign all but ignored Iowa after he
came out against government programs
to promote ethanol.

But political winds can shift, and
old lessons die hard. That is why, as
For/one magazine reported last Octet

because of our dependency on foreign
oil but its greenhouse gas reduction ef
fects." A reversal of this magnitude by
one of the Senate's most vocal ethanol
critics can only mean one thing: he
wants to win the Iowa Caucuses this
time around.

On the Democratic side, however,
the debate about ethanol seems to have
improved signiﬁcantly from 2004 to
this year. Even former Iowa Gover-
nor Tom Vilsack, who has practically
bathed in ethanol every morning for
the last eight years and who could easily
be rtinning for President as the “Corn
Candidate," has shied away from give
ing fullsthroated support to cornsbased
ethanol. As he frequently recites in TV
interviews and stump speeches, ethanol
is "a good way to begin the conversa-
tion" about renewable energy, but it is
not an end in itself.

Recognizing that com production
cannot meet the demands of both the
ethanol market and the food market
in the long term, Vilsack admits that
pushing exclusively com-based ethanol
as the solution to our energy problems
could soon force the US. to choose be»
tween food and fuel. This is particus
larly alarming in a nation where such a
staggering percentage of our food con—
tains corn or relies on it for production

(as Michael Pollan, the author of 1/2:
oviniiooict Dilemma, notes frequently
in interviews, corn is “the crop that ate
America”).

In the coming weeks, Vilsack will
roll out a more detailed platform on
renewable cncrgy. It is likely to pro-
pose a comprehensive approach to our
energy problems, including fuels made
from biomass, switchgrass ethanol, and
perhaps sugar. Cornebased ethanol will
make his list for sure, but it will no ions
ger be the final word on the issue. And
if the former governor of our state isn’t
“all ethanol, all the time," his competi-
tors won't feel the need to be either.

In broadening the debate on renew.
able energy, Vilsack has given other
Democrats seeking the presidency con,
siderably more latitude than they have
had in past caucuses. By allowing them
to speak on the issue with more nuance
now, he helps other Democrats avoid
taking positions on ethanol that will
seem unreasonable to voters in other
states across the country.

While Republicans may still have
to fall on their swords over the issue,
it looks like Democrats will be able to
have the reasonable, frank debate about
renewable fuels that our country de-
servcs. And, in the long run, our state
and our caucuses will be better for it.

The art of avoiding come-ons and insults

It’s funny the way compliments work. Stop just
short of the line, and you sound insincere; cross the
line, and you’re charged with harassment and share
ing a cell with Bone-Cmshin’ Bruce. You might think
that pcople would just smile bnshfully when you ap»
proach them at the salad bar and casually mention
that you think they're incredibly gorgeous, but this is
not the case.The key to a good compliment is a corns
bination of sincerity and apathyito appear honest to
someone Without seeming like you might actually be
looking to inhabit his or her body. I would tell you
all the ways to win people over with your charm and
charisma, but let’s face it:I don't have either ofthose.
So without further ado,1 present a guide on how not
to compliment people ifyou want to remain socially
unsostmcized.

Backhandcd Corn; ents

The noth g worse than a compliment-that-
iSnvtrquittarcomplimcnlrﬂndrmighrrinrfﬂctrberanr
insult. There’s a fine line between telling someone,
“It’s great how you don’t let studies get in the way of
your partying!” and saying straight-out,“Let’s be hon-
est, you’re an idiot.”You should also avoid using com-
pliments to secretly compliment yourselr “I admire
how you consider your own needs," you say. "I'm just
always putting other people first." Yeah, okay, Con.
ceited McBitcherson, Is your greatest ﬂaw also that

Overboard Compl ents

The sad, soc lly desperate cousin of the back-
handcd compliment is the overboard compliment.

This is the kind of compliment that usually happens
by accident. You’re sitting in Bob’s, pondering your
friend-crush on an attractive acquaintance, and sud-
denly you're telling her that she “looks good in com»
fortable clothing". This compliment can easily take
an awkward turn when you try to correct yourself “I
like your shirt," you say quickly. “1 mean, your body
just looks good in it... I mean, not that I'm staring
at your chest... OH MY GOD, I IUST WANT TO
BE YOU."

Comparison Compliments

It’s not unusual to think that two people on cams
pus resemble one another. We’re a small school,‘and
let’s face it, halfofus are cut from the same awkward,
slight-taciaI-tic cloth any-
way. Because of this, you
would think that it would
be safe to tell someone,
“Oh, you look exactly like
this girl in my lit classi"

she’ll look like a oneseyed
beast, and your friend will cry secretly in her room

Blatant Lies

My favorite kind of“complimcnt"- thc out-and-
out lie. We've all been there: you notice your friend's
heinous new hairstyle,and without thinking, you blurt
out, "Oh, you got your hair cutl" And now you're left
With an awkward dilemma: either you stop there and
imply the haircuts hideousness by your silence, oi you
make something up. Some people say that honesty is
the best policy, but those are the people who sit in the
front row in Intro Philosophy and tell stories about
high school. The best idea is to quickly say some.

turn away or busy yourself
with some food so that the

In the Grinnell bubble,
awkward compliments are
generally hilarious, which
makes it a little scary to think about the real world,
where coworkers and people on the street arent so
forgiving of accidental comeeons. In the end, though.
