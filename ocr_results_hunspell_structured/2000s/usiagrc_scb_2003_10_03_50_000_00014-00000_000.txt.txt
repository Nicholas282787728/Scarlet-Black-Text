History prof asks, “What kind of leaders?”

alan Ennes imiessor emeritus

Over aconruryago Grinnell Piesideni George
cares said he wished he “hard ihe power ro ad.
equarcly express my abhorrenee of ihe bread and
buirer idea ofcollege eduianionThe noiion, I mean
ihar whar a college ediicarion is for is ro n1 iis pose
sessois ‘ro ger on in rhe world' bcrrer ihan one muld
wiihoiii ir."

Gares' ideas are rarlier dared, bur ihey find an
echo in ihe response ofenrcring Grinncll srudenrs
io such nuesrions as whciher rhey wanr ro be a
business I:aderor“vcry ivcll offfinancially" or “sue.
cessful in a business ofyour own” or wheiher ihey
chose Grinnell “to be able in make more money"
or in get “naming for a specific career." The per.
ccnrage ofcrinnell srudenis answering “yes" rosuch
oucsrions is lower rhan ihe avenge perecnrige of
enroringsrudonisar eleven peer colleges and ar orher
“highly selecrive insriruiions" aeeoiding ro recenr
annual surveys conducred by ihe Higher Educaa

rion Research lnsriruie (and made available by Carol
Trosser, ihe college’s director of 1nsriiurional Re.
search).

Gates emphasiced ihe concepr of “service" as
ihe aim of a Grilmcll giaduaie and he would be
giaiified rhar more :Iucrlng Grinncll srudcins rhan
ai rhese oilier schools have such obyccrivrs as “pro
moring racial iindcrsianding," "cleaning up Ihecnv
vironmeni," “helping orhers in need,” influencing
“social values “ and devttioplng “a meaningful phi-
losophy oflife." Fewcr fiiiure Grinnellians enrered
wirh rlie aim ofbeconiing a “business executive,"
or having “adminisuarive responsibiliry for ihe work
oforhers" or becominga "communiry leader." siill,
”business" and “eduearion” remain ihe leading ca.
recr areas ofcrinnell alumni. Afier all, as Calvin
Coolidge said: “The business ofAmcrica is biisi.
HESS,”

A 1993 comparison of fii-si-years and seniors
discloses ihar rhe pcreeniage of seniors wiih “ser.
vice" relared obyeerives remained ihe same or in.
creased over ihe four years and char ihe already liba

cial poliiicnl views of cnirring siudcnrs became
more liberal. As elsewhere beer drinking doubled
and approval ofcasuul sex increased. And :1: Grill-
nell, nioie female rhan male snidenis believed ihar
individuals can “influence ihe world,”

More seniors rhin ﬁrsrcymrs aimed ai “com.
muniry" leadership, seniors said rliey had increased
rhcir “leadership abiliry," rheir “wriring and speak.
ingabiliry" and iheir ”self-conﬁdence." While rhere
is much more dara and all ofir is subieer ro dilfei.
mg inrerprcrurions, ihe surveys should nor provoke
ihe remark ofn misree ar an open forum lasi year:
"Why aren'r we producing leaders—or srudenis
who rhink ofihemselves as leaders".> oi as business
leadcrs?

The college helps produce differeni kinds of
leaders in dilrcrcnr kinds of professions and corn»

1 do have ihe feeling ihar some of rho irusrccs
(who are well—represenred byalumni business had
ers and eorporare lawyers) would like more :mv
phasis on business leadership. They are versed in
die language of "change agenis." “enrrepreneurs'
and “srraregie planners." some are enrhused aboui

The crux ofmy column, and iis mosr conrenrious poinr, was rhe

human decency at the panel discussion on “9/11/01 — 9/11/03:
