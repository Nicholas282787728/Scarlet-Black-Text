Uber-cards arrive

by Michael Andersen
News editor

chen Grinnell student volunteers are now in the midst ofth: trial
periods for seven prototype identiﬁcation cards that incorporate prox-
imity key—card technology with the current student ID cards.

Though a vendor has not yet been selected, some type ofpmxlm-
iry/lD cards will be instituted among students, faculty, and start by
next fall, predicted Dean ofCollege SeerCKS John Kalkbrenncr. They
would probably also take on one additional function, such as laundry
or photocopy-machine credit or use with clocks at some student robs
In the future, the cards might be able to store credit records from a
school aocount, and some town businesses might accept them in place
or cash. Emily l<ruse, a communications specialist with the college,
also anticipated “a web interface providing user information such as
account balance-s."

The proposed cards would retain their use with library, dnlng hall
and bookstore accounts; most or all of the suggested functions would
eventually be integrated,

Scrcalled ﬂbCFCaI'dS, currently in use at such institutions as Indi-
aria University and the College ofWooster, have in recent yetrs been
the subject of sporadic debate in Grinncll's Student Government As-
sociation. Most discussions deal with possible encroachment: of stur
dent privacy, Ali student proximity cards currently carry irleriiirying
tags that can be used to limit entrants to some campus buildings or,
with the slgnalum of Dean ofthc College Jim Swam, [rack student
movement into locked buildings.

in 1997, when the proximity and: replaced manual locks on dorms,
a numberotstudenrs randomly swapped theirs in order to prevent the
possibility attracting; such activities would not be possible under the
proposed new system,

“student populations are prime candidates for the slippery slope,”
said Ray Huggins '99, who said he clearly mulled the card exchange,
“once everyone is used to having their key log their personal into
when used, they may also get used to, say, doorrramc sensors that
detect a chip in their ID: diai then log whenever they actually walk
through a door." Huggins, a townebasetl web designer, said that the
ptoxImll’y cards were much more convenient than conventional locks,
but suggested that ID strings encrypted from student names rnight bc
associated with the cards, thus keeping a voluntary wall between com.
putcr functions and administrators.

Kalkbtcnnet acknowledged the validity ofsuch privacy concerns,
but recalled only two times when security had judged any student
tracking necessary. “In most institutions they’re able to Work through
that by having people trust the policy," he said. Any data gathered for
security purposes, he believed, is destroyed after 90 days.

New card photos may be ralecn as early as this spring, Kaiiebrenner
