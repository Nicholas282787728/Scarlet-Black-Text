Student tells of return to
war-ravaged homeland

By Zorka Milin
Staff Columnist

At the end of Tolstoy’s Arum
Karenina, after she throws herself
under the train, her lover, Count
vronsky goes to ﬁght forSerbian int
dependence from the Turks. This
type of romantic Byronian hero,
mad enough to give up everything
and go off to some god forsaken
Balkan land, is long dcpnrtcd.
Nowadays, we all know that the
Balkans are a very dangerous place,
one ofthe so-called “hot spots” that
are best observed at a safe distance,
courtesy ofCNN.

For me, the Balkans are a con-
crete piece of the world and of his-
tory. They are my birthplace. After
an absence of almost two yeaf$ (I
could not go back because of the war
in Kosovo), going home this winter
was a great occasion. When friends
ask me how it was, I am uncertain
what to answer, not only because my
English has deteriorated after over a
month of speaking and thinking
Serbo»Croatian, also because I am
not sure how to make you under-
stand.

I’ll turn to the cinema to explain.
One of the world’s best living direc»
tors is Emir Kusturica, three-time
Cannes winner, Muslim refugee
from Sarajevo who now lives in
Belgrade. He directed Underground.
In a scene near the end, one of the

ﬁlm’s heroes, searching desperately
for his missing son, runs through
battle smoke. He alternates repeat-
edly between screaming for the lost
child and hollering the order: “Fire!”
This kind of durable, crystalline re-
ality, sharpened by a history ofsuf»
feiing thnr seemingly lrnows no end,
stands in contrast to the unbearable
lightness of life here in the us,
where you always know whnt co mes
next and would sell your soul for one
millionth of an inch of pure longt
ing.

We’ve got plenty of exuberance.
New Year’s Eve was celeb rated twice,
since we still honor the old calendar
which lags two weeks behind the
Western one, and both times it was
an insane night ofgun shots in the
streets (celebratory gunfire on holi-
days is an ancient and honored tra-
dition in this part ofthe world), fire-
crackers, singing and shouting,
drinking plum brandy. the tradi-
tional Serbian national drink.

In spite of the embargo and the
resulting Third World economy,
Yugoslavia is the land with most gas
stations in the worldiwhich is to
say the people crowding the sides of
the roads, gasoline-filled canisters
and bottles in hand. The thick dark
ﬂuid, poured openly into the tank
in a slow stream by exceedingly care-
ful hands: something quite rare, pre»
cious, a treasure ofthe Earths There

Column: easy for US to ignore

EAST LANSING, Mich,

As I flipped through the pages or
The State News this week, I was
shocked to see i story about the con-
flict hctwern Ethiopia and Eritrea
(”Speaker tells ofAfrican war,” SN 1/
28). I couldn't believe it,There liwas,
a story ahout what the reporter called
"The largest war in the world.“

How can this be? Is this the ﬁrst
coverage ofa war thrir has been going
on for two years?

i suppose we should he grateful to
ThestateNewsforrinallyhringingrhis
war to readers' attention. i guess i can't
complain .. it‘s not like the major news
outlets are doing much honor. The state
News docs, afttrall, get its nntionnl and
world news from The Associated Press.

Perhips we should applaud The
state News for its rcportcrs' efforts to
buck the trend ofthc American media
nod actually print in niticlo on this cont
ﬂict. As I wrirt: this column, Reuters (ii
British news organization) doesn't have
anything nhout this war in its top star
tics and neither does CBS News.

Apparently rhc Western picss lins
decided to Concentrate on more impol»
tniii conﬂicts There critninly hasn‘t

been n lack ofnews concerning Grozny
or Kosovo in recent weeks. How much
have we heard ihotitstiraievo in the past
tow years?

Wlint ire the differences in these
wars that make some so important to
our news services, while others nit hur.
ied in back pages or not addressed it
all? is it that no one cares about Africa
and everyone cares about Europe?

The civil wars that followed on the
African continent are closely linked with
this European interference. The war
between Eritrea (now a separate nation)
and Ethiopia is only one ofmany con.
flicts that have spread across the conti—
ncnt, Nations like Sierra Leone liavc

Why does the Unltutl starts send

selfwishing that the country’s isola»

goods and comfort might continue
to be out ofreach.

We hnvc become an island oflepe

out nevereending ethnic con-
flicts must have become tedious to
you, but from our perspective, air
raid danger sirens, sounds of cruise
missiles and bombs, sights of de
siroyed buildings and bridges and
dead bodies— all of that will haunt
us for generations to Come; forgiv-
ing has never been one of our tale
ents. Yet, if we are to survive, we
must collect the strength to break
out ofthis disastrous chain, and pull
into another story. As sartre fa»
mously remarked, “life begins on the
other side ofdespair,” and although
we have been swimming in this pool
ofunreality for so long, awakening
will be rough, but it must come, for
all our hope lies on the other shore.
