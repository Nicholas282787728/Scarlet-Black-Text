The elections committee decided upon the new race for president
only arter lengthy deliberation. There was no precedent upon which to
base this decision and the committee attempted to come up with the
solution that was most on to those invoivcd and also the most demn.
crane While some forms or government elect their representatives on a
plurality (he or ehe who gets the most votes wine), we do not at Grinncll
Coiicgc. I and the committee reel strongly that student Govclnmenn
hascd on the practice or scircgovernanca, requires the consent or the
maioriry, therefore we urge all interested parties to run for SGA presi.
