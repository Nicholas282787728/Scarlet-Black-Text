Every time I rcll somebody that I
go to joint Board, they always is ifI'in
a senator. When I tcll them that I'm
not, everyone has the same reaction—
they think I'm cr \thn I tell them
about how much you can learn at joint
Board thcy
think I'm
slightly loss
or y. For me,
[l\C atvarcncss
that comes
out ofit is ad
dictiilcil couldn't go back to my pre-
Joint Board life ifI tried. The entire
system is geared up so that all of the
committee meetings, all ofthe meetings
with administrators, and all ofthe stu-
dent concerns across campus are boiled
down to a couple of hours. That’s not
the whole story, though. You see, joint
Board sucks.

Despising Joint Board seems to be
one ofthe things that every Grinnellian
has in common. Even Senators, who

 

don't have much other responsibility

time-wise, hare it, It's clear that the

rest orrhe student body isn't such ii coir

to cure repetir

and circular

dchates by

‘ drinking and

wishing it would end sooner. I wonder

how many ofyon would recommend a

vodka gimlet as a means to cure belligr
etence.

But it‘s not even the downward spit
ral of drunken debate that frustrates
me. I know most ofyou are interested
in knowing what’s going on around
campus. There exists a mechanism to
disseminate that knowledge to you, yet
you don’t take advantage ofit, The pats
tern is always the same: I’ll make a mm,

Going to Joint Board without an obligation to do so

ment about some issue to a friend, said
friend will want to know how I found
that out, i say joint Board, they chuckle
in disinterest It's time to remove the
languor of ap horn Grinuell with
a big ol' helping of Student Govern
nient in action. it is SGA‘s job to get
you as much information as possible,
You don't even have to meet them halfe
wayithc ’11 do most ofrhe work,

This year’s eibinet must know that
joint Board is broken. They're in a
great positron ofhaving many different
perspectives on how things could be,
and that’s why I’m calling on them to
overhaul Joint Board If people aren't
coming then it is their job to increase
participation and shake up the status
quo.

Some aspects ofJoint Board have to
remain the same for practical reasons.
Parliamentary procedure has got to
stick around to facilitate debate during
session. What about having cabinet
arrive at rise or 6:45 to take any stiie

ord /l 0 offers some options to increase Joint Board attendance from nonrsenator participants

dent questions or concerns in an open
Forum style? They could be in front
of the dining hall at that time to make
themselves even more accessible. Dirtr
my, Joint Board itself the chair needs
to keep a tighter rein on unproductive
conniicnts. No. Mr. or Ms. Senator,
repeating what the person said before
you in a trrtreient voice is not helpful.
Many stutlcuts are also concerned with
budgets for other student gloupsiivhy
not make these at seven, along with the
rest of the material geared at encourage
ing student attendance?

We all know that Joint Board is
broken right now. it functions for
SGA, but it does not function for the
student body as a whole, That is why,
in my mind, it is unacceptable for this
to continue any longer. It is time for
everybody involved to stop talking a
mean game and actually do something
about it. rfwe only see one big change
from our SGA leadership this year, it
should he joint Board reform,

Unexpected security

Last \vcck,Joint Board had its most lively discus-
sion of the semester. The topic was an interesting
one, provoked by a sharp increase in alcohol-related
incidents: should ACE security be allowed/required
to attend lounge parties,> As a body, we discussed is-
sues ofprivacy, required (bad) versus allowed (good),
ﬁnancial implications, and the latent moral hazard of
delegating all drinking responsibility to a few hard-
working students, None of that really matters though.
When I wandered into Loose and Ready and peered
into the back corner, I found that the decision had al-
ready been made {or us; ACE security was at a lounge
party, Asking around,1 found out that it had already
been decided ‘from higher up' that ACE security was
notjust allowed to be, but rcquircd to bc at several of
the larger lounge parties.

Student Affairs experienced numerous per-son-
ncl changes between this semester and last The new
guard promised to be more friendly and proactive
while following the much lofted principle of self
governance, While all of this sounds good and well.
I feel as though I need to clarify what ‘fricndly' and
‘proactive’should not meanrwhcn a‘fricndly Student
Affairsv means one who. unannounced, sends its deans
to college students’parties, a ‘friendly Student Affairs’
opposes selfsgovernance. When a proactive Student
Affairs' means one which implements policies with
out proper student input, a proactive Student Affairs'
runs counter to selfsgovernance. I understand the
term selfsgovernance can also be wisliyrwashy and
was never really meant to justify an anarchic narctr
paradise for students like so many ofus believe, so I'll
clarify the tern-ii Here is what self governance should
mean to us in this situation (1) Students need to

watch out for themselves as well as for one another:
It's ridiculous how many alcohol hospitialications
there have been so far this semester, Gtinncllians
should be both smarter and more caring than that,
What better thing does your drunk ass have to do
than keep your friends and peers safe. (2) Student Afr
fairs should give more weight to widespread student
opinion. Selfrgoveinance should he more about srur
dents than Student Affairs.

Republican mistaken

In the September 26 issue, the Sam-let mid Blnrk
reported on the Carroll/Palmer contest for State Rep
tesentative. The 2006 election featured the same two
candidates, and in the recent 5 as B article, Campus
Republicans Co-leador Valerie Stiniac was quoted as
saying, “My understanding is that it was the college
that made the difference" This, more properly, is her
misunderstanding. The November 9, 2006 issue of
the Grinncll Herald Register (archived in Burling Lir
brary) details the results ward-by-ward. That article
shows Palmer winning by a total ofos9 votes district-
widc, but only 398 votes were cast for him in the first
ward, which is the word that includes Grinncll Col-
lege. The first ward also cast a healthy 204 votes for
Carroll Palmer won that election with broad support
throughout the district, and misrepresentation ofthe
results as being unduly swayed by crinnell college
students serves no one.

Pajama boy responds

Something very peculiar happened to me recently.
Once a loyal Obamaniac, I became a sold McCain
man. And it's all Ashton Kucher’s fault.

On Saturday I agreed to see Dude, \thrc's My
Stock Market in h my fricnds. “\Nhy not,"I thought
to myself» This was sure to be the greatest spectacle
since the elephant man masturhatcd in front of the
chicen ofEngland,

As soon as Ashton and his wife arrived, he shout-
ed.“Huh. look at this pajama boy" “I guess you don't
need to dress up to voter" Unsurprisingly, the stupid-
ity behind this slight spilled over into the rest ofAsh»
ton and Demi's talk Let me paraphrase these cclchri»
ties' two main poin 'f Obama wins, everyone will
get free money, and when Demi jet sets to Paris to
buy a new dress on the Champs Elysccs, she won't be
embarrassed to be American. Are you cit/citing with
me? This isn't Oprah's b’ free giveaway, Ashton, it's
real life. And poor Demi is embarrassed> I'm embar-
rassed to share the same air as you! Just because you
are a celebrity doesn’t mean you have the right to
preach to as about politics,

Before I frnish.I must give the Campus Demo-
crats a swift spanking, not only for condoning such
a cheap stunt. but also for creating an CnVironanr
ofrntimrdation at Grinnell. I'm sick and tired of be-
ing abused day in and day otrt by Boss Tweed and
his bloodesucklng nosfcrdru, I call on all Grinnellians
to throw off their shackles and send these pigheaded
zombies back to the Tammany Hell from whence
they came.As for you Demi, I suggest you go read the
new Highlights issue because I hear this week's pic-
ture search is particularly challenging. And Ashton,
you’re nothing but a face, a hollow franchise. Take
my advice and stick to what you're best at: picking up
Bruce WillisY leftovers.

I’m a McCain man now, lfanyone wants me, I'll
be on the StraightTalk Express.
