Highway Six to Amana ,

baum,down trot-n Buthng, after you've left even the backside onlad
behind and waved good-bye to Dari Barmsomething happens to the
city otGrinnell: it gives way to town. Our Sixth Avenue soon becomes
Iowa's Highway sot it happens so quickly you can miss it during a
ﬁve-second nap, then wake up suddenly confronted with a limited
palate orgteen and yellow ﬁelds, blue sky and the occasional small
pcclingrpaint town where you might have expected the Slum,
After a little less than an hour on Highway Six you will reach
the Amana Colonies, a cluster of seven villages you would not be
blamed for calling picturesque.Tht: deliberate quainrncss ofthe bed
and breakfasts, the taverns and the billboards proudly proclaiming
Willkalilmm,’ to all driverSrthrouglt seems a little selfrconscious after
the impersonal rollby of the rest orowa. But it is also undeniably
friendly.
The Amana Colonies were settled as
*1»; arel'tgrous commune in Amana in 1855;
. the seven villages were run corninunally
until 1932rThis makes Amalia one of the
longest-lasting communes c\ler.Thcse days
the colonies are a tourist attraction, with
. plenty of restaurants, shops and “sights" for
.1 tourists to see. And, yes, the town is also
/ home to Amana refrigerators. Despite this,
the colonies still retain a sort otspecial charm
st which, undoubtedly, assures their survival. It
takes only the smallest suspension ofdisheljef
- New to think that small villages like these still
43-; cover the state, or that they ever did.

The rolling streets of the city ofAmana were,
on Saturday, gently busy with people. As soon as we had parked the
car, my photographer noticed avendor selling kettle corn and wanted
some, but, rather than dawdljng looking at the historic landmarks,I
anxiously pressed forwar'd.Wc had important work to do.

The Festival

In the beer refrigerator at McNally's, tucked bee
tween the sierra Nevada, Flying Dog and Heineken,
you will ﬁnd a couple otsix—packs by Millstteam Brew—

This particular Saturday was not just a hot day,
but Millstrcam’s 20th anniVCrsary, As a celebration,
Millstrcam was hosting the ﬁrst annual festival of
Iowa beers, and eight of the fourteen Iowa breweries
had turned out to show oﬂ'
their stuff, alongside two
homerbrew associations.
Every beer at the festival
made Miller High Life look
less like the champagne of
beers, and more like the
inbred,draw1ing Cousin of
beer that the other beers
stay away from at the bL‘L‘i"
rainily retini

“Oric thing wt: need to
do is educate Iowans on Iowa breweries and the craft
beers that are available here,” said Teresa Sly Albert,
one of the owners ofMillstrernn. “We got some good
stuff here in our own backyard that people don't even
know about. "

'lhc festival was held in a vacant lot across the
street from the Millstrcam Brewery under a tarp not
much bigger than a school bus. In the shade next to
thc tarp a knot of people loungcd in ebairs, drinking

”One thing we need to do is edutdle Iowans
an lowa breweries and the (raft beers that
are available here. We gorsome good stuff
here in our own bdtlryard that people don’t
even know about,"
Teresa Sly Albert, Millstream Breweries

beers ofcourse, hiding from the harsh afternoon sun
and scarﬁng down big brats with sauerkraut. Under
the tarp, people milled from brewer to brewer, ﬁlling
their glasses with the best Iowa has to offer, chatting
jovially with the brewers and whoever else happened to
stumble in their way Across the street in Millstream's
Biergrmn, a band played a decent cover ofAmcrican
Pic. “It's a tough job and somebody's gotta do it,"Teresa
said about brewing, “It might as well be us."

As I made the rounds of the
diﬁerentbrewers,1didn’tjust taste
the beer, but chatted with the
brewers themselves. They ﬁlled
my three ounce commemorative
glass while telling me about hops,
ales,lagcrypcated"malnwhatever
else 1 happened to ask about and
much that I drdti'tl

The brewers. every one of
them men, had a detailed knowlr
edge otbrewrng and beer which
only comes from a certain sort ofmasculine obsession
and dedication coming close to love.

VVhele some men are obsessed about Cars and
beer, others about football and beer, these men have
simpliﬁed rhc equation: they are just obsessed about
heer.’lhcr-c was a distinct scnse ofcamaradcric, notjust
between the brewer's, but between everyone there; we
were in Iowa, and we would not do a double take if
somebody started telling7 us about cask fermentation,
