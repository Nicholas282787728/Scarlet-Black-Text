“Mason Strnwhacket's drowned
hog, 1946" is exactly what it sounds
like: a picture ofa big, dead pig.

This and the 29 other black and
white photographs on display in Burlt
ing Library's gallery depict life on lowa
farms between 1925 and 1960.

christened with unpletentious ti-
tles like “Making giant haystack using
rigged forklift, ca. 1935" and “Grindr
ing corn for cattle feed, 19505", the
photographs were obviously taken and
named by an artist with an Iowa farmer
mentality himself.

The photographer, A. M. Wertach,
was actually horn and raised in New
Jersey until taken by farm life while
working on a dairy farm after high
school. so, according to his son Robert
Wettach, he went to the local public lie
brary to find out how to be a farmer.

Wettach, captured a critical time in
farmingithc shift from hotsetdtawn
to giISrpowcted vehicles, a change that
would ultimately lead to the end of the
way of life Wettach captured with his
camera.

Commissioned by farming magat
zines to photograph this new, revolir
tionizing technology, Wettach liked to
focus on “handy ideas" that individual
farmers had thought up to modify gir
ant, commercially-produced machines
such as tractors and balets.

While Wettach’s plain and honest
photographs give a face and feel to the
end of the small farm era, they are not a
romanticized idealization of the tough
farm Life.

Even if they did present the cliche
image ofa “simpler time" David Sena
’09 pointed out after viewing the pho-
tographs that it would be “unreason-
able to feel nostalgia, since we can't go
back."

Today, the small family farm is no
more than a memory for most Ameri-
cans, as large-scale commercial farms
dominate the industry.

Although he had no professional
training in photography, Wertach be
came a fullrtime photographer soon
after World War It and supported his
family by taking pictures of small farm
ily farm life, such as several scenes that
were bought by encyclopedias to illuSr
trate the “Iowa" entry.

From farm to farm, Wettach hauled
a 12-pound craﬂer Camcm, through
which he could only view the scene up
side down.

Despite these difﬁculties, the Burl—
ing exhibit presents skillfully composed
photographs of families canning com,
cutting hay and shoveling minute to
keep their farms running.

His people skills soon made him
more than just a businessman to the
farmers he worked with “He never met
a stranger," his son said Soon his clients
became friends whom he would photo—
graph in his free time.

It is fascinating for students to get
a peek into a past that children of the
'80sand '905 can only learn about from
books and the occasional roadside his—
torical artifact. Some Grinnell students
in particular have been interested in
viewing Wettach’s photographs, keeps
ing in mind the decline of the small
family farm in the modern era.

“The buildings and machines that
we see now crumbling at this time were
revolutionary," said limes Anderson ’07
after viewing the exhibit.

“These photographs insist that the
family farm is a cultural heritage and
needs to be protected," he said.

The exhibit will be on display
through November 6.

“Summer School at the Seashore,’
an exhibit curated by Nicole Bungert
’06, marks the beginning of an excit-
ing new program in the Grinnell Art
Department,

The Chrystal Center exhibit ofwat
tetcolot paintings by Iowa artist and

Grinnell graduate Edith A. Sternfeld,

"As part of an internship, I felt the
students needed a chance to do more
' substantial work, which could include
cumting an exhibition from work in
the Grinnell College Art collection,"
Wright said.
This year, bungert decided to focus
of the work of Stemfeld because of the
relevance her work had to the Grinnell

"I think this
exhibition is value

are interested in art

involved in the arts _____..__.__ said Bungert.

Now we will shOWt
case students not just as artists but also
as curators,” said Lesley Wright, direc—
tor of the Faulconer. “I am hoping that
at the beginning of every semester, our
student intern can have an exhibition
on view in the Chrystal Center."

Bungert gathered the works and did
her research during the two months she
spent interning at Faulconeri

The internship opportunity is one
fairly new for Grinnell students, a for-
mal program instituted only last fall.

A Grinnell

graduate, stcrnfcld played an integral

role in establishing Gtinnell's art def
partment.

While Sternfeld is a widely exhib—
ited and award winning artist, Bungert
had to dig deep to find information
about her.

“I was reading Sternfeld's personal
letters, pamphlets from some of her
exhibitions and 3373 articles about her
from as far back as 1930," she said "To

I’m accustomed to studying‘blockbust»

While this may have been a chal-
lenge, Bungert toolt the lack ofwriting
by or about Sternfcld as a unique op
portunity to look at her art with a fresh

perspective.

“With Stcmfeld, I could approach
the work from any perspective I chose
fin this case, Sternfeld’s depiction of
labor and everyday life,"she said.

The exhibit is open for viewing
in the basement gallery of the John
Chrystal Center until Sept. 18.
