Deerhoof to bounc_l into Gardner on Thursda

The San Francisco-
based band’s new
album comes out in
October, but you can
hear their fuzzy sounds
next week

The concerts committee bills Deere
hoof as “fuzzy art rock." Their style,
their songs and then iecords ale all
fuzzy: not cute, but not haid core. Have
ing opened for both VVilco and the
Roots, they have a fuzzy {in base its
well.

Their latest work, 77» Rmmll‘i Fall),
to be released on October 11, reminds
me ofBjork stuck in a high voice with
less techno and more rock and roll.

Itthat's too pedestrian of n com—
parlson, think ofsongs that sound likc
Chinese cpcm: unpredictnble rhythms
backing highrpitched, feline vocals.

Although at times their songs sound
like good indleepop with dry cymbals
and bits of brass, sometimes things get
a lot more fuzzy

Deerhoof seems determined to keep
the construction and logic ofsmall masr
terpieces a complete secret. Most of the
tracks are without verses or tunes, but
still hold together, which makes them
all the more intriguing.

There are twenty songs on The
Runner: Fmir, spilling into each other,
not quite deﬁnable as separate stories,
or even obvious songs at all. It’s the
kind of music ideal for snyounng un-

The band has gone through lineup

but lead singer Satoml Matusaki's spice
has remained the same.

concerts chair Brendan Baker '06 said. Gardner Lounge

They’ve moved from more rock-
driven work in the past to slightly
cooler pieces on Tit Rtmnerr Fm, but
the fact that they‘re sort of an indie-
pop-squenky-slidy-jnm-hand remains.
Deerhoof is deceptive, unpredictable
and strangely fun.
