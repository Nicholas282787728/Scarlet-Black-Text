After three years or being a chubl' an
at Gt ncll, one truth has become disti
irigly apparent to inc: my Gland Old l>rrty
populated by illi alliance ofwhincls incl “gitly
men," the likes ofwhich have not been seen
since thc radical movements ofthe sixties.

Republican groups and movements on
college campuses are the most heinous us»
cis of the “it's not fair"childli politics that
has nearly destroyed
issue politics in this
country.

As a case in
point, this summer
the Pennsylvania
House efRepresen-
tatives passed HR
177, intended to
“promote intellectual diversity and academic
freedom” in public universities and colleges

in the state. The resolution was a result of

lobbying efforts by snidcnrs for Academic

libeial populations.

Campu. Republicans preoccupation
with ihci is is i minority that is sup
posetlly di. animated against is indicative
of several irbing trends cruient in the
GOP.

The first is our seeming inability to Con‘r
pete in the intellectual realm with our more
liberal counteipartsvwheu we can‘t win, we
claim discrimin‘dt
tion rather than
forming a legit
cally valid argu-
mtnt.

The second is
that we now rely
on the govern-

ment to fix the slightest of societal or cul-
tural problems we perceive existt Republicans
have continually turned to state governments
to enforce academic “equality" and prevent
gay marriage and the fedeial government to

other than the illustrious
David Horowitz.

The resolution, based
on Horowitz’s Academic
Bill of Rights, creates a se-
lect Committee to report
to the legislature on the
state of academic freedom
and find cases in which students report hav-
ing assignments graded unfairly due to the
ideological position they take (i,c., consert
vativc). Similar bills are being consideicd in
state legislatures across the country largely
as a result of the discrimination complaints
made by Republicans in schools with more

The third, and per
haps most disturbing
tiend, is the critical lack of
real issue discourse within
the party and between
the party and outsiders.
So-called “academic free-
dorn,"in the way it is cont
ceptualized by Republicans, rs an issue that
affects few people materially.

The real effect of the Pennsylvania House
Select Committees work, of course, will be
to cKplOlt public animosity against the acat
deinic community fol political gain, not to
rectify disciimination in the academic estab-

the bchTél difcl‘bToCk

lrshmenr.

This is the same reason David Homwr
ira, who came to Grinnell a ye. ind a half
ago, speaks on college campuses: to incite
protests that make students and profess '3
look intolerant and create in us (conservrr
rive mainstream) vs. them (liberal academia)
sentiment among non-academics, which can
be easily exploited for po-
litical gain by Republicans.
In this way political load

can exploit the politics of
association,

Unfortunately, this res
ality gets to the heait of
the current political role of campus Repubt
Iican groups. I don't mean to be too harsh
to Republicans in Grinnell, because I am
ideologically very similar to them on most
issues.

However, their function in the greater
Republican Party apparatus has not been to
convince others of the soundness of tradi-
tionally core GOP positions—that is, pro-
moting ﬁscal restraint, limited government
and individual rights.

All too rarely do Republicans here ac-
tually debate issues of substance with their
Democratic counterparts within an intelt
lectual framework. Rather, Republicans role
on all campuses has been to highlight the
supposed pcisccution they havc endured by
a liberal majority to the nontacademic com
munity, thus reinforcing the notion of acne
demic liberals as “bad guys."

Tins was also the point of State Repre-

counterparts.

sentiirive Danny Cairoll's campaign flier in
last yellle election that suggested that “East
Coast,"“|ibc .il" students had no place vots
ing for Iowa represent rvcs. T e types of
“assucrtitronar and “Victim” pol only cn~
hancc the image ofa broader “culture war"
dividing Americans.

Paradoxically. though, the success of cul-
ture war (Le. non-issue)
politics in elections has
also prevented the GOP
from implementing its core
policy objectives while it is
in power.

The recently passed
Transportation Equity
Actiwhich will cost $286
billion and fund in particular construction
of a $223 million bridge in Alaska that will
service fifty people—demonstrates that Rot
publicans can no longer style themselves the
party offrscal responsibility.

Rather, the non-issue—focused campaign
style of Republicans limits the ability of
elected officials to build support for politit
cally difficult policy decisions, such as budget
austerity. This is unfortunate for those of us
who value policy change more than electoral
victory.

If College Republicans want a real voice
on campus, they should work through estabs
lished forums like SCIPE and the Rosenfield
Program to discuss and debate substantive is»
sites and get their message actoss.This would
not include inviting counterproductive agitat
tors like David Horowitz, but rather enlight-
ened policy advocates. Otherwise, they will
never escape their role as pseudmmarryts,

Discovering Filipina self at Grinnell

Columnist Erin Sinogba explains her ethnic identity by tracing her varied roots in Korea, Grenada and the Philippines

Here in the us, everything needs to be qualified. You
aren’t anything without stating your age, sex, gender, race,
ethnicity, major, occupation, or religion

During orientation as a first year, we learned how to ap
prcciatc KoreantAmcricans, Chincsc~Amciicans, Afiican-

Now, obviously, I’don’t need to attend
Grinnell or even live in the us. to figure
out that I'm not American,

NorisAmericanncss permeates every
aspect of my life here. My first steps on

far end ofcustoms, where my fingerprints
and a haggard transtl’uciﬁc mug shot are
taken to make sure they can identify me th

Every yeat,1 am haunted by terms like Ir20 and L94 (not
U.S. interstates), SEVIS and OPT. On a less legal note,I am
part of groups like the International Student Organization,
where they encourage me to display my culture by partici-
pating in International Dress Day, adding to the diversity of
flavors at the Food Bazaar, and singing at the Talent Show.

Even on an individual scale, people remark at my curious,
unpronounceable surname, asking where I am from. I natu-
rally respond by saying, “The Philippines.”

Yes, I am Filipina (with :in ~a, the feminine form). I know
this from the shortness of my height, my iayimaiiggi brown
skin, and the way I talk in a Sing—song voice and pronounce
dud: as “Dood!”

I now also know this from the language I speak with only
one other person on this campus and from
the feelings of nationalism after listening to
a song about a dad leaving his son to work
abroad. The funny part is, I didn’t give a
shit about any ofthis until I got here.

You see, I didn’t always grow up in the
Philippines. I was born in South Korea and lived there until
I was five.

Voices of Grinnell

I didn't learn Tagalog until after that and even then was
looked upon as a foreigner at my elementary school in the
Philippines because I didn‘t know how to play Chinese jum-
prope or to speak everyono's slang.

Then my family relocated to the beautiful island of Gret
nada when I was seven and lived thcic until I was eleven.

Dining thcsc formative ycais, in what Jamaica Kincaid
would call “a small placc",l remained
tight with my excluswe group of
friends, who were mostly foreign—
eis — the children of ambassadors,
businessmen. NGO directors, and
even families who just happened to
be sailing by (literally).

My family made an cffott to be
friends with the few Filipinos to
magically appear on the island, who were made up ofa driver,
a nanny, the wives of Ghanaian and Canadian nationals and
ii bunch ofcooks.

Honestly, I didn’t always enjoy hanging

with our Filipino friends .. on the corn
trary, some were pretty awesome.

I just hated the way that we always
had to stick to our little Filipino bubble. I
hated bclng reminded that I was still Fill’
pinor

Mind you, this had nothing to do with nlrprno—ness itself
at all. After living outside of the Philippines for so long and
after having friends my age who were a large mix of nation-
aliries,I really had no idea what being Filipino was supposed
to mean.

Additionally, there were very few in—
stances tit that point where my nationality
was set in opposition to others

It was never about how I was Filiin

Scottish and Gita was Trinidadian-Cura-

It wasn’t even about howl was born in Korea,wliilc Alicia

was born in oman and Gita lived in Canada for a really long
time.

We knew all of thesc things and (won talked about them
at contrived school events like International Day, but it was
never truly an issue. we were just four friends who somehow
ended up together in a little school on an island far away. No
papers or passports involved.

I returned to the Philippines when I was eleven and my
dad gave me the gift of putting me in another international
school, where my cultural construct remained.

I met wonderful people who shared this with me, even
other Filipino nationals who did not feel or “act" Filipino. It
was nice to know that I was not alone, especially when faced
with criticism from others for not being Filipino enough.

Looking back, it was as if my environment could have
been placed anywhere and the outcome would have been the
same,

There was no sense of strict separation by nationality and
whatever differences we did acknowledge were embraced with
a grain of political ineorrectness.

Wearing baggy jeans and a FuBu swear
shirt in 30 degree celsius weather while
talking loudly with your Cali twang? That’s
a raritinynii for you!

Of course. I only think back on it this
way now, after a few years in Grinnell, I
didn’t know what political correctness even
meant until issues of what made appropriate satire after the
GUM fiasco came up.

I didn't know there was a difference between race rind eth—
nicity until my first few Anthropology classes. And I certaint
ly did not know that I would eventually accept and embrace
my Filipino-mess, both legally and internally.

Yes, after years offeeling nationaliry-less,I can safely rind
proudly say I am Flllplnﬂ. Despite the mix of cultures that
inﬂuence me here in the U,S.,being Filipino is whatI hold on
to and remember consistently. '

However, like the American, I will not hesitate to qualify
it with my history. After all, it is the way of life to make sure
you have an identity.
