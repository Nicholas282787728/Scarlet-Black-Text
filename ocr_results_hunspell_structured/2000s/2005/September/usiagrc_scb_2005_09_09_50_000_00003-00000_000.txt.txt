Campus supports Katrina relief effort

Student groups collect money, dry goods to aid hurricane victims

av RACHEL FIELDS

In the wake of.) tremendous disaster, millions of
lives are being slowly pieced back together and Grins
ncll College activism is alive and ﬂourishing

Several campus groups have come together to
raise money and goods for the victims of the chﬂ‘uC’
tion left in the wake ofHurricane Katrina. Headed by
l<risten Hocrr ’07 and assisted by Chaplain Deanna
Shorh, the Campus Republicans and Democrats have
joined forces in an attempt to my,
lcct donations from both students
and members or the larger Grin-
ncLl community. Other groups,
such as the Grinnell College
Christian Fellowship, Habitat for
Humanity,Chalut1im and SGA,
have also given major support

According to volunteer Sarah
Pruett '07, the effort began with a small meeting of
several groups, in which close to 20 people brains
stormed ideas for gathering donations. According
to Renata Herberton ’06, people manning tables at
Qiad, Cowles and the Forum raised over $1,000 on
the ﬁrst day aloneThc second day brought in close to
the same amount,

Volunteers also went door’tordool’ in the campus
dorms on Tuesday, Sept. 6, to collect money from stu-
dents who could not donate at meals. In addition to
the monetary donations, the groups collected material
goods on Tuesday outsrde the post office. Students
were invited to donate clothes and food to send to the

then donated to the Van Wyk Freight Lines, which
had already begun to organize efforts to gather sup-
Lies.

P Also contributing to the cans: will he a campus
widc sale of Mardi Gras beads. Pruett read about the
idea in 7711 chu Yer/d Timer and felt that it would be
perfect for Grinnell. Inspired by the immediate suc-
cess of the other collections, Pructt contacted Grins
nell College President Russell K.
Osgood, Vicespresident for Student
ServiecsTom Crady and the admin-
istration of Grinnell High School,
Osgood and Crady agreed to as
sist the groups by purchasing 2,800
Mardi Gras beads. In the coming
weeks, the Mardi Gras beads will
be sold at campus events, and at the
high school by members of the student council. “we
wanted it to be a collaborative eﬁ'ort," Pructt said,
“This way, everyone can come together to help those
who really need it."

on Friday, Sept. 9, Herbertcn and Diana van
Schilfgaarde '06 will be traveling to the American
Red Cross branch in Des Moines, Iowa where a
group ofhurricane refugees will be arriving, needing
food, shelter and medical care.

According to Pruetr the groups have managed to
raise over $3,000 in donations and supplies to assist
the Van Wyk effort. 1‘ ’ve been completely shocked by

how generous everyone has been," she said.

Alum, conservative vie
for school board seat

BY DAVID DRISCOLL

On Sept, 13, the Grinnell-Ncwhurg School District school board elections
will directly impact Grinncll's population orschoolsrge children.

Julie Tabat ar is uncontested in the rural district, where current occupant,
Lori Brown, is stepping down. Harriett Dickey-Clrasins ‘82 and incumbent
Randy Lidrka are both running for an at—largc position.

The campus’s attention has been drawn to the electron by to the Campus
Democrats campaign against Lidtka, who they claim is "antivevolutlon and
antisgay rights.“ Lidtka took issue with several advanced biology and ecology
books considered for purchase by the District. He told the Gn‘rrlrzlchmlcheg—
not in May 2004 that “evolution is woven in the fabric ofevery chapter or this
book I don’t forscc creation science being taught in school, burl do think that
we should see the weaknesses in evolutionary theory

He did vote for the new textbooks after reviewing the current ones and dec
ciding that they treated evolution similarly.

Earlier this year, Lidrka objected to an antisharassmcnr policy which in
clrrdcd sexual orientation. He moved to eliminate the phrase, which was added
in 1995, and eventually voted against the policy The board nevertheless ap-
proved it ssz.

Lidtka declined a request for an interview. His only comment was that he
“[cncourages] kids to come out and Van: for him"

He told the I-lcrald—chirter that his qualiﬁcations are “[tihree years' experi-
ence, being the parent of four children, havrng the ability to listen, business ex—
perience and common sense."He feels the biggest challenge facing the district is
that “[t]his generation ofkids will compete on a global basis with countries that
have a labor rate much lower than ours Parents, teachers, administrators and
the community need to inspire all kids to be the best they can be”

According to Amanda Baker ’08, co-leadcr or the campus Democrats, the
campus group has postered bathrooms and loggias, and registered between 150
and 200 people to vote in an attempt to rally students aganist Lidtka.

Some ofthe posters featured conservative pastor Fred Phelps holding a sign
that featured the word “fags”and associates his anti-Matthew Shepard crusade
with Lidrlta’s views.

She feels his opposition to the harassment policy personally affects college
students. “There are a lot of closedrminded people in this town,and we have to
live here.”

Baker said she supports students voting in local elections “The town and the
college have a very symbiotic relationship, and the only way to maintain it is to
make sure we have a say in the town."

Dickey-Chasm: returned to Grinncll in 1997 and works at the Poweshiek
County Mental Health Center. She was uncomfortable with some things Lidtka
has done, particularly the debate over the sexual orientation clause.

Some of her biggest priorities are making Grinnell schools a regional draw
by making one of their programs the best in the area. She encourages students
rrotjust to vote against Lidtka, but vote “for something."

Last semester, three student groups
joined forces to cover the campus in
scotchctaped flycrs depicting bullet-
rrddlcd bodies whose blood ran the
color of Coca-Cola. One successful
student initiative later, a campus boys
cott against Coke was initiated in re-
sponsc to allegations of human rights
abuses in a Coke afﬁliate's Colombian
botding plant. Stickers were placed on
every Coke fountain and vending ma-
chine on campus advising students of
the boycottt

This semester, however, the boycott
is technically over. The stickers have
came down, and questions remain over
the future orthe AntisCoke Campaign
at Grinncll. Student inrtiatives only last
to the end of the academic year, but in
the semester that the boycott was in ef-
fect, there was a noticeable reduction
in campus Coke consumption. Mean
while, the Latin American Solidarity
Group (LASG), Student Organiza-
tion of Latinos/as (SOL) and Students
Against Sweatshops (SAS) continue
their efforts to change the campus’ soft
drink provider.

The origin of the international
campaign agrinsr "Killer Coke" can be
traced back to a lawsuit filed in 2001
against Coke on bchalrota Colombian
union rhar represents bottling employ-
ees, SINALTRAINAL. Union leader

Isidro Gil was murdered by Colombian
paramilitary forces while working in
the coca-cola plant in Carepa in 19%.
He is one ofeight union leaders who
have tried to organize bottling employs
ees in Colombia and been murdered.
Since 1989, according to the website
forThe Campaign to Stop Killer Coke,
“Hundreds of other Coke workers have

been tortured, kidnapped and/or ilie- .

galiy detained by violent paramilitaties,
often working closely with plant mans
agements.“

Coke fervently de-
nics any involvement
whatsoever. “The
CoeasCola Company
and our bottling part-
nets support the right
of workers to choose
the representation that
believe best meets their needs,” accord-
ing to a statcmcnr on a Cokcsspons
sored website, wwwroklf/Idtarg.

Although Coke has consistently
denied the allegations posed against
it by activist groups, the Campaign
against coke has spread to many cols
lege campuses in recent years and rs
still ongorng.

Last fall LASG, which had
previously becn primarily an educ
tional group, decided to become act
two and push to get Coke products off
campus. The group aims to examine
the ways in which the actions of the
us. government and Us. groups affect

Latin America and to raise awareness
or issues in Latin America. In light
of the allegations against Coca-Cola.
LASG obtained the petition signatures
of more than 20 percent of the student
body in favor or boycotting all Coke
products on campus. The group then
passed a strident initiative calling for
the boycott.

Strident initiatives are recommen—
dations put forth by individual students
or student groups that are voted on once

a semester. Although
the recommenda-
tions have no bind-
ing legal effect, they
serve as a legitimate
poll ofstudcnt opin-
ion on issues and
demonstrate student
desires to the admins

rstration. in response to the student
initiative, Dining Servlccs posted signs
on all Coke machines on campus and in
the dining halls stating that the student
body had Voted to boycott Coke.

Susan Hildebrand ’08, an active
member or the AuticCokc campaign,
acknowledged that the boycott was
drffrcrrlt since Coke products were the
only soft drinks available on campus
and that the “most valuable thing [the
boycott] did was raise awareness for the
student body and administration" about
the various political issues surrounding
Coke,

Still, the boycott made a dent CCO’

nomicrxlly: Dick Williams, director of
Dining Services, estimated that the col-
lege spent mono-4,000 less on Coke
products second semester, out of a typic
cal budget of 3750079900, due to det
creased student consumption. Student
initiative policy dictates that boycotts
only last until the end of the academic
year and so returning students were
greeted this fall by stickerstree Coke
machines.

Some students were confused last
year by the stickers as the only means of
enforcing the boycott. “Some students
felt that the referendum would throw
Coke on campus or switch to Pepsi,"
said Williams. However, while Coke
machines have been on campus for more
than twenty years, the college signed an
exclusive contract with Coke ﬁve years
ago and brealdug that contract would
be costly. T he contract gave Grinnell
College a not publicly disclosed but,
according to Willlams, “substantial"
sum of money in exchange for the cols
lege carrying only Coke products. Ifthc
college were to kick Coke off campus
beiore the contract expires, some otrhe
money would have to be returned.Thc
contract expires in 2008 and its renewal
will be decided upon by thc presidents
council, “Personally, I feel that the col-
lege will not renew the contract simply
because of the boycott last year," said
Williams, citing that the administra-
tion has heard strident concerns and
“taken it pretty well to heart."
