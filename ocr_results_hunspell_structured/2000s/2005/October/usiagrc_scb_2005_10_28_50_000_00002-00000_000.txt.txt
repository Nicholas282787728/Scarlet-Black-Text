SerVIce funding in transition

No programs have been cut, but additional projects are difficult to
fund as SGA tries to shift funding to the Community Service Center

BY CHRIS NEUBERT

With community Service Cen-
ter (CSC) director Amy Graves just
returning from temporary leave and a
new SGA resolution aimed at curbing
spending, community service groups
are still anxious about their ﬁnancial
ﬁlture. While Student Affairs, SGA or
the CSC are meeting all current needs,
there is little room for growth, or spe-
cial projects.

The issue arose
at the Joint Board
meeting on Sept.
27, when requests
by several service
groups to fund ad
ditional projects were denied because
of an SGA resolution implemented
last spring. Ir recommends SGA wait
on allocating funds if there is another
department on campus whose purpose
is to fund specific groups,

Vashti Davis '06, a leader of Alter-
native Happy Hour (AHH) who per-
formed part of Graves' duties while she
was on leave, said for this year, “We
have all 'the funding needed." Most
groups, like AHH, received their hind.
ing through the csc arid SGA, Davis
added that the only funds that were
denied were for “extra programming”
AHH eventually received its extra
funds througli Student Affairs.

Matt Cleinman '06, SGA Treasurer,
said that the actions ofjoint Board were
not meant to have negative impacts on
any service groups, but were intended

willhappen,”

”[l’rn] optlrrllstlt that funding

to reduce dependence on SGA. Clein»
man said the resolution to reduce SGA
funding of service groups came after
discussions on how to better prioritize
where to spend money after funds ran
low at the end of spring semester.

“We realized that we had been his
torically supporting a decent amount
of community scrvice stuff," Cleinman
said. “That was great, but we also have
a Community Service
center, Having SGA
duplicate that flinc-
tion didn't seem to be
wise, so we discussed
gradually scaling
down out commit-
ments to community service groups."

According to Graves, both she and
SGA “agree on a fundamental need to
reduce anxiety and a need [for service
groups] to search around for funds,"shc
said. "My goal is to work toward creirs
ing a stable budget for our established
groups."

Graves satd that budget increases
require time to secure. During her
time with the CSC, Graves said that
her budget has remained “completely
static." The only increases she has seen
have been for Alternative Break.

Additionally, the SGA by-laws res
strict SGA from funding charities die
rectly and indirectly. Clcinman said that
the clause (found in Article V, Section
2 of the bylaws), was subject to some
interpretationThe clause has not been
consistently followed in the past, but it

For the record: correction

from our last issue

The News Sioly, ~Cornnirrnrty service unfunded,” incorrectly said that

adds impetus to SGA‘s desire to shift
responsibility for funding to the csc.

Following the first denial of funds,
Davis, Cleinman and others formed a
committee to revtcw any changes to
how community service groups would
receive their funding.

Davis said she felt that the commits
tee meeting was productive and that it
resulted in “many good ideas and [a po»
tential] student initiative.”

On Tuesday, Graves submitted her
budget for tract year, as *ng for an in-
crease in funds. She said that reaching
her goal ofstability would require buds
get increases. “We are only asking for a
few thousand dollars more,"she said.

“We hope the college will see that
these are good programs," Graves said,

Davis said that she “is optimistic
that funding will happen." She said
that she “remains anxious about where
that funding will be coming from."

Cleinman also added that the Stu—
dent Programming Committee has
more funds this year than it did at this
point last year. The committee has been
discussing funding service groups once
again if they are unable to get funds
that they need.

“These are really deserving proj-
ects,” Cleinman said. “We want to see
them continue. We’re committed to
seeing that no matter what, these projt
ects continue into the future."

The student group Intifada, organized around solidarity with
Palestine, submitted a request for money to bring. a speaker to
campus. Sen. Lauren Standifer ’07 (MCI) said that the debate
about the request amounted to censorship and that student groups
should receive their budgets regardless of whether senators ape
proved oftheir names or not.

Students Against Coke representatives, Jenny Dale '06 and
Sarah Hildebrand '08,presented a resolution to continue the Coca-
Cola boycott and eventually end Grinnell College’s relationship
with the company after the contract expires. The resolution was
tabled until after voting on upcoming student initiatives.

President Bohman ’06 announced that there would be a Grab
23c Go survey included with student initiatives to help determine
the aspects of the programs students liked most.
