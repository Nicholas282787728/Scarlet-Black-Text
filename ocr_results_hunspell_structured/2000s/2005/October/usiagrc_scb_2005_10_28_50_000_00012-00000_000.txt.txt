BY KEVIN BVRNE

The football team is looking to
reverse its four-game skid with a trip
up to Green Bay, Wise. to visit St.
Norbert and come away with a vic—
tory.
The football team will finish its
three game road trip this Saturday in
Wiseonsin,where they suffered a re—
cent loss to Lawrence University

The Pioneers had the lead late
against the Vikings of Lawrence,
but could not hold on in the fourth
quarter clue to some defensive mis—
communication.

“I think what allowed Lawrence
to score late was that defensive plays
ers were not doing their job," said
linebacker Dan Hardin ’07.

Withjust 7:44 minutes left in the
fourth quarter, Grinnell held a 19-14
lead thanks to two rushing touchr
downs by Lance Burkholder ’08 and
a touchdown pass from quarterback
Sean Pfalzer ‘07 to Ben Remington
’08.

Lawrence then went down the
field twice for touchdowns to seal
the win, with the final score resting
at 27719.

Aside from the fourth quar-
ter comeback by the Vikings, the
Grinnell defense gave a strong per
formance, The Pioneers recovered
six fumbles, had two interceptions,
one each by Nick Merklin ’08 and
Pat Faurer ’09, and blocked a punt,
Leo Martin racked up 10 tackles and
Hardin added nine ofhis own.

The loss to Lawrence came on
the heels of another disappointing
defeat the previous week against
Knox.

Grinnell was up 24-17 with 11:51
minutes remaining in the third quarter,
However, the Knox offense rattled off
33 unanswered points before the end
of the game, securing a victory over the
Pioneers

“The Knox game was a real tough
loss, because at halftime I really felt
we had the momentum and that our
guys were playing well," said Head
Coach Greg Wallace. “We came out

the second half and scored right away,
but they came back and scored on us
fairly quickly. Then we had a turnover
in their territory that resulted in a score
for them and we seemed to lose the
edge we had. We never seemed to get
back the conﬁdence we had at halftime
and the score reﬂected it."

Despite the disappointing second
half, the Pioneers did have some bright
spots. Pfalzet ﬁnished the game 22 of
45 for 248 yards and two touchdown
passes. He also ran for 28 yards and a
score.

for 96 yards, while Marcus Plouzek'09

added sight catches for 121 yards. on
defense and special teams, Merklln had
an interception and six kickoff returns
for 157 yards, including a long of 70
yards.

The conference losses put Grinnell
at 1-6 overall (0-6 MWC). As they
push on, they continue to battle their
conference opponents along with
the injury bug. Down to less than 40
healthy bodies, the Grinnell offense
and defense must get creative in the
final weeks of the season to continue
to compete.

“Injuries have hurt us heavily this
year," said linebacker Tyler Martin

'09. “We have lost lineman, running
backs, linebackers, defensive backs and
it seems that every game we have at
least a couple major contributors to our
team hurt."

The Pioneers will work their uni
dermanned squad hard this week in
preparation for their final away game
of the year.

_ “The game this week is about
mental preparation as well as physical
preparation," said Wallace. “We have to
continue to work hard on fundamental
play and execution.We will have to play
aggressive hard hitting football against
St. Norbert."

The perfect conference season
for the Pioneers has ﬁnally come to s
close. It would have been nice to see the
women win just one more match, but
all good things must come to an end.

After bringing home the Midwest
Conference Championship, there is
nothing left for the women's tennis
team to win.

The tennis team has more than
lived up to the high expectations set for
them at the beginning ofthe season.

The tennis team traveled to Wis-
consin on Oct. 14 to compete in the
MWC championships, which took
place over three days at the Nielsen
Center in Madison.

The Pioneers handily defeated the
anrcncc Vikings 5r1 in the semiﬁnals
match on Oct. 14 to move into the fl’
nals against St. Norbert.

Grinnell defeated St. Norbert S-
0 later that day to claim the MWC
title. The Pioneers swcpt thcir dour
bles matches against St. Norbert and
two wins in the singles category were
enough to seal the deal.

The Pioneers have successfully do
fended their MWC title, seeuring their

position as MWC team champions for
two yeais in a row.

The back-toeback conference titles
leave no doubt that the GrinneLl wom-
en’s tennis team belongs at the top.

The MWC individual champions
ships that took place on Oct. 15 and
15 gave the women an opportunity to
show off their personal skills in singles
and doubles matches.

The Pioneers picked up the No. 1
and No. 3 doubles titles as well as the
No. 3, No 4 and No. 6 singles titles
while they were in Madison.

Although St. Norbert had a good
team, the dominating performance by
the Pioneers was not surprising.

The women have had an excellent
season and their record clearly indie
cates their level of play.

The women's tennis team had nine
wins and two losses before going into
the MWC championships and it was
undefeated in the conference, going 4,
0 before taking the conference title.

The Pioneers have ended their sea»
son in stylc and they have clearly shown
that they Will be a threat to the other
schools in the Midwest Conference for
a long time.
