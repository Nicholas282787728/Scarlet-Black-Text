Calm down and take deep breaths “WWW

Emotions and deep feelings for
people and ideas are a hallmark of the
human experienceThey are truly what
make life woith living. Indeed, the Cubs
have brought me
from screams ofglee
to the edge of tears
the past three years.
But when we engage
in intellectual CliST
cussions, especially
on this campus, and erpm‘ally with [=-
gard to policy issues or the college and
governments, our personal feelings have
no place in the deliberations.

Emotionrmlnded policy forma-
tion has been a common Criticism of
the Bush administration. Paul O'Neill,

- former Treasury Secretary, complained
that President Blish does use tiaditional
forms of briefing and debate in his dc—
liberarive process, but only accepts those
opinions that fit within his own narrow
ideological framework, essentially mak-
ilig decisions “from the gut."

Clearly ,we have a crisis in leadership
when this is happening. Our president
cannot altei policy to fit changing situ-
ations and new empirical data, meaning
that his policies come down to tax cuts,
immovable diplomacy and a gutting of
the government bureaucracy

Being such a common criticism of
such a disliked president, then, I was
surprised by the path of the discussion

Bill Wli en we engage in mic/lectual
discuss/ans .. our personal feeling:
have no plate in ills dellbemlloni

on afﬁrmative action in the South Fo-
iiiin lounge last Tuesday. The panel dISA
cussion, put on by CARW, featured six
speakers on affirmative action.

During the
“question alid an-
swer" portion of the
talk, one person in
the audience quesr
tioned the value of
affirmative action in
the college admissions process, arguing
that such policies may have a greater
cost than benefit for minority students
and using data to back her up.

The reaction to these comments
was outrage by several students, and
tempers grew over the course of the dis-
cussion. The conseouenee, piedictably,
was a misrepresentation ofrhe audience
members argument, which was simply
for people to take a more nuanced view
of affirmative action policies.

This over-emotionalism in intele
lectual discussions not only creates bad
feelings and makes arguments personal,
but also distorts others’ arguments to fit
one’s own preconceptions of the wrong-
hcadedness ofthe “other side.”This has
been the source of fallacious reasoning
of the supporters ofthe Bush adminis-
tration,who equate criticizing the press
idenr's prosecution ofthe Iraq Warwith

V “not supporting the troops."

In reality, there are more than two

sides to the afﬁrmative action debate,
including many nuanced positions that
would like to either reform or redirect
attention away from the use of such
policies. For me, it makes sense to al-
low private institutions and businesses
to enact whatever acceptance or hiring
policies they want, whether it be afar
mative action or not, but force public
institutions to discount race and gender
factors in both marketing and admiSr
sions or hiring.

T h i s
doesn’t mean
I’m “of-
fended" by
those who
think that
the govern-
ment should
disallow the use of racial preferences in
private institutions or those who believe
public institutions have a social obli-
gation to promote greater diversity in
academic and work life, it just means
I think they’re wrong in identifying a
Wide role for the government.

We've reaped other costs in our soc
ciety for our tendencies to become cmor
tional and easilysoffended by our intelr
lectual adversaries. Most recently, many
Americans have allowed themselves to
be distracted by absurd and irrelevant
political conflicts.

In response to their belief that they

are being attacked by secular forces,
evangelical Christians are pressing for
the teaching of sarcallcd “intelligent
design" in high school science courses,
though this only distracts the focus of
students from learning observable thCOr
ries. Conservative groups have launched
campaigns to cajole commeicial advei-
_ tisers to use the more Christian “Merry
Christmas” rather than "Happy Holis
days” in their marketing slogans. All
the while, the us. is engaged in two
wars and one
metarwar on
terror, which
seem to get
less attention
from some
media than
the great
Christmas culture war of2005.

What does this mean for you and
me? 1 think most of us agree that we
should try to reason our way through
problems and achieve as much come
promise as possible in any body politic,
whether it be at school or in civil gov
ernment. But we can't do this ifwe act
like children and complain every time
someone disagrees with us. Otherwise
we will never understand each other. We
need to be able to focus on real issues
that have a material affect on our lives,
and that takes an intellectual maturity
that even Grinnellians sorely lack.

A Prig’s Point of View

Small portions of food, large doses of TV

I’m leaving France next month. I've been study
ing abroad in Nantes, the sixll'rbiggest city in France,
since August, and I’m not ready to leave yet. I love
France, even if theie was an adjustment period to get
through.

After the initial shock ofnot being in Grinnell for
a semester wore off, the hardest thing to get used to
was speaking French. Nothing is more humbling and
frustrating than having a hard time expressing my
selfand sounding like an idiot while doing it. was it
really possible that 1, who
have been studying French
for set years, could be so
stupid as to regularly for
get simple words like “fish“
and accidentally call grapes
“monstrous plums?"

Well, yeah. But thankfully, my French language
abilities have been more or less taken care of by three
hour lectures at the local university. living in a farm
ily with a talkative eightryearrold, and having French
friends who love to teach me all sorts of bad words.
Don’t get me wrong ...I still say horribly stupid things
all the time. But I'm resigned to being the equivalent
orthat gullible and weird foreign exchange student in
movies who always says badlyrphrascd crazy things.
It’s liberating now that I’ve gotten used to it.

And if I wear a scarf around (because French
people really are as scarfrcrazy as you think) and look
all French in my allshlack ensemble, tourists/clueless

View from Abroad

people approach me for directions and don't question
my French at all when 1 respond. Just the other day
I answered the phone at my house and the lady on
the other line confused me with my 16-year-old host
sister. so maybe i'm starting to fit in more than 1 reals
ize.

Actually, now that I think about it, the hardest
thing to get .used to was actually the small serving
sizes in France. This would not have been so bad if
the food had been terrible, but it was wonderful, and
left you with the feeling of
wanting to eat more. This
would not have been a
problem if the serving Sizr
es left people satiated—but
for us hungry Americans,
alas, a main dish was never

enough.

This would not have even been a problem if
snacking were allowedibut eating between meals
is. in France, only for children or people with no self
control. Besides, I am it broke college student who
doesn’t even want to spend money on meals. The
result? For a while, constant hunger. Even the Unit
versité dining hall wouldn't catch us a break, as their
meals are rationed and not all that satisfying. And as
a icsult, l became a food-obsessed person. However,
once I realized I would not die ifI didn’t stuff my
face at every meal and drink three Naked Juices ‘tl day,
it was okay! I'm still ali ,happy and I've only lost

about three pounds. I’ve learned to appreciate food
more for its taste than for the supposedly nice feeling
ofstuﬁing yourselfuntil you just can't take it anymore.
or maybe my stomach shrunk, Regardless, the secret
to survival is to always, as the French do, end the meal
with a sweet delicious dessert. And the desserts here?
Better than forum cookies, trust me.

i’m supposed to be writing this article to tell all
you poor souls stuck in Iowa what it’s like in France.
Sorry. I’m too busy watching TV most of the tllne,
actually.

The cool thing about being abroad is that I can
watch shows like StavAtadrmy (the threerhoutrlong
French version ofAviemmi Mal) all day long with the
excuse that they are teaching me about the French
culture. I think] realized how much I have changed
since getting to France while watching Starﬂmdtmy
one night, actuallyil watched a museular black man
wearing a long silk black skirt gesticulating wildly
while singing Madonna's “Like a Prayer" without even
batting an eyelash.

This doesn’t seem weird to me anymore. Neither
does seeing dog shit on the streets, or giving people
kisses when 1 meet them, or dancing to techno in lieu
of“Gettin’Low" in a smokednfcstcd discolhéquc.

All in all, I’ve survived my study abroad cxpei’ir
encc wirlioilt any disasteis—if you don’t count my
cigal‘ettcesmoke sccntcd wardrobe, ha—and it is an
experience I highly recommend to .ill wotildsbe eti-
rotrash/Gi-inncll French majors.

complaining in

is always more
fun that doing it
alone.

Why?

Everyday we pass each other without knowing
what the other hasjust experienced. Well, I had the
opportunity of knowing what another student had
experienced; she had her wallet, money and iPod sto-
len from her room Saturday night. Inside her wallet
was her Green Card and Social Security curd,which
is her only way to get back home.

Her semester has been full of unlucky events al
ready and to have someone take her only means of
getting back home is awful. I have to ask “WHY?"
I also would like to encourage the person who has
taken her belongings from her room to please return
them to either her or the security Ofﬁce. If someone
knows any information, please let us know,

A cold, sweaty goodbye
It's cold outside and I‘m wearing leans, massive
- Lowa hiking/albweather hoots,aT-shirt and, the kick-
er, a navy and white Mexicanewoven parka that he had
since high school—perhaps cure on occasion, but this
was not one. This ensemble already made me feel like
Mountain Man, and then I added a long, semirdtessy,
black wool coat and a purple scarf

But the worst part about all of this is not my nerdyv

clothes or even the sub-freezing temperatiues—oh
no,I can handle the cold. My big beef is that 1 have
checked out three different computer labs on cam-
pus only to find that they are each about 103 degreesl
I don't mind ditching my outer layers, but I do mind
being Smelly, sweaty Girl in HF when 1 was already
Ms. (been of the Mountain when i clomped in. How
are other people wearing SWEATERS in here? And
TURTLENECKS? Ugh, it makes me want to apply
deodorantjust thinking about it. This is no way to end
my Grinnell career—in a puddle of sweat and sur-
rounded by my lame outfit.

A warm, personal goodbye

A5 photo editor {or three and a halfyears, my goal
was to provide content that could only be afforded by
a photojoutilalist's view of a story—4mm the crowd-
ed floor of the Iowa Caucus to the interior of the
Rosenfleld Center construction site. Photography is a
subtractive craft, butI believe that photographs giant
glimpses at the greater scope ofoul- lives. Our photo-
journalists are talented and I am accountable to them
as much as I am to the greater Grinnell community.

Everything that has a beginning has attend. These
six semesters at the 588 have coalesced as the high-
light ofmy Grinnell career. 1 now believe that college
is not about ensconcing students in academiaAtllat
may be the purpose of graduate schoolmthese four
year-s are about growing up and developing our per—
sonal identities. Towards that end, and to the poster-
ity of Grinnelliansl am standing dovm as the photo
editor of the sets. 1 thank you-for this opportunity
to serve you as 1 pass the torch to Nick Hooker ’08.
Goodbye and good luck.
