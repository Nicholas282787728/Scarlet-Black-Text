“must have”

Grinnell does not have setpomts! I
was in shock. I discovered this while at»
tending. Ecoecarnpus, which is a group
of staff, faculty and students who work
together to implement more ecologi—
cally sound practices at Grinnell. A set-
poiut is a standard temperature found
in all buildings.

To me, it seemed obvious to as
tablish a common temperature point
Within campus, not only to curb our
consumption of fossil fuels, but to less
an the ﬁnancial burden of heating. Yet
Grinnell does not have them.

Fortunately, Ecocampus and Facili-
ties Management are working together
to change this; I sigh, “thank goodness."
The plan is to maintain a balance be-
tween comfort and energy efﬁciency
To do this at temperature will be imple:
mented throughout all academic buildr
ings, with the exception of Noyce.

The proposed temperature wiu be
68 degrees in the winter and cooled to
76 degrees in the summer time. Cur~
rently there is no standard of heat in
the buildings and they range in lcmr
perature from 68 to 74 degrees,

The college is projected to spend
about two million dollars in heating fuel
for the fiscal year 2006. By implcnicntr
mg the new heating setpoints of68 de
grees and 7c degiees, Gtinnell College
would save approximately $108,051
annually, As energy costs use, these
savmgs are projected to increase,

Not only are there ﬁnancial incen-
tives to the implementation of set-
points, but ecological reasons as well.
With Americans contributing 25 per
cent of the world's greenhouse gases
and holding only five percent of the
world population, it is Grinnell’s social
responsibility to minimize our environ-
mental impact on our surrounding.

By installing these setpoints
Grinnell College will reduce its carbon
dioxide contribution by approximately
957,4 tons annually!

Grinnell is not the only college 35,
tablishing setpoints. Many of our peer
institutions are doing so as well includ»
ing: Bowdoin, Carleton and Middle
bury College, as well as Northwestern,
University of Vermont and Colorado
State University

It is very exciting that Grinnell is
taking these progressives steps to star
ate a more sustainable campus by mini-
mizing our environmental footprint
through scrpointse even if] do have to
wear my long johns.

This letter is a iesponse to SCI-
l’lZ's defense of the exclusionary way
in which they ran their “open forum"
on student initiatives several weeks
ago. SCIPE professes itself to be, and
is perceived on campus as, a "multi-
partisan group dedicated to facilitat-
ing political discourse by drawing on a
broad range ofviews with the intent of
increasing student awareness" (ImpeJ/
wwwgritmeli edu/rrudeni/gtonpr/polie
iitr).

However, at the open forum sponr
sored by this “multi-partisan group,”
only initiative proponents were allowed
to speak on the panel, while opponents
were relegated to the audience. SCIPE
arbitrarily chose to categorize student
Voices as “authors" and “non-authors,"
and allocated speaking privileges aCr
cordingly.

If we were to accept the legitimacy
of this framework, it would make per-
fect sense to keep initiative opponents
in the margins of the process. The
problem, though, is that like almost
every act of political exclusion, this
framework is bullshit.

This begs ii question of motive.Why
did a purportedly non-partisan group
grant privileged status to the people in
favor of initiatives while rnarginalizing
the opponents? It’s sure as hell not out
or any knowledge of the political pro-

Anti-Semitic

One wonders if Noga Ashkcnazi,
“Tmnsccnding differences to address
Israeli-Palestinian conflict" (11/18) , can
differentiate between criticism ofIsracli
policy and attempts to delegitimize 15,
mel, much less detect anti»Semitism.

Those of us, the vast majority of
Jewish Israelis and Americans, who
support the establishment of a Palesr
tinian state aside a secure Israel find it
hard to believe that anyone — much less
an Israeli who has
had encounters With
terrorism » can mis-

groups like Sabeel.
According to its di-
rector, the presence
of the jewish state is temporary, only
to be subsumed in a Greater Palestine,
which would end Israeli sovereignty
(Chicago Tribune, 10/9/2005 archived
on W10,Sfa7id’wil/lu$.Wm/Ilt'waaSI
own/111430)

Here are other past comments in-
dicating intolerance toward Israel by
speakers at the Iowa sabccl Conference

According to its [Saber/’5] director,
take the rhetoric of the prcienre ufihelewiihsmleis
lempumry, only to be subsumed

cess in general. In the us, for example,
states and counties that have voter ini-
tiativc processes grant equal space in
their voters’ guides to the proponents
and opponents of initiatives.

I honestly have no idea where SCI-
PE got the idea that initiative propo»
nents are political
actors entitled to a
place on the podium,
while opponents are
rilfrraff who should
be expected to shout
from the aisles.

If SCIPE wants
to live up to their
mission statement's promise to “draw
on a broad range orviews,” they should
start by embracing basic fairness. They
insist that anyone who wanted to speak
at the forum was allowed to do so, and
think that should be the end ofthe diS’
cussion. However, to say that a forum
was fair because everyone was tcchni-
cally allowed to speak‘is to miss the
point completely.

The fact of the matter is, SCIPE’s
rulcs created a situation where the op
position had limited, unequal speaking
time, no light to answer audience ques-
tions and no formal authority or status
within the forum, Culling ‘rln event like
this either “fair” oi “balanced” would
make Rupert Murdoch blush.

SCIPE claims that the purpose
or the panel was to “foster awareness"
about student initiatives by "promotr
ing dialogue." In the past, SCIPE has
shown a real devotion to this goal. Take,
for example, the issue of marijuana le-
galizationr

Ifany other group
on campus wanted
to take up this issue,
they would probably
have paid for a single
speaker to reprer
sent a single point
of view, and if any-
one disagreed, well,
there’s time at the end for questions.
But SCIPE held a higher standard.
Last year, they went out of their way to
bring articulate speakers to represent
but}: sides of this important and COlTiT
plex issue, because that’s how political
education happens.

The group seemed to understand
backthen that fair and informative diar
logue shouldn’t be left for the question-
ing period

In this way, SCIPE formed a repw
tation on campus as a bastion of event
handedness in a sea of partisan hysteria.
Why they left thcsc principals at the
door of their “open forum" remains a
mystery.

Furthermore, the Sabeel Conference
at Coe College unacceptably integrated
untirscmitism into its message. This
was acknowledged in a letter issued on
behalf of Coe College's Department of

Philosophy and Religion by Depart-
ment Chair John Lemos:

“The Dept. of Philosophy and Relir
gion at Coe is aware that some anti—Se—
mitic remarks were made at the recent
Sabeel Conference held on our campus
and which our department sponsored.
We are also aware that there were other
breaches of civility during the confer»
ence. Let it be known that the members
of our department find antirsemitism
of any kind to be deplorable and inex-
cusable, and that we also object to un-
civ-il behavior."

coe's faculty may have been referr
ring to such things as Halper's on-site
reference (according to audience mem-
bers) to the Hebrew scriptures as “books
of genocide” and Professor Marc Ellis'
graphics showing an Israeli helicopter
gunship emerging from a Torah scroll.
The faculty may also have been shocked
by Rev. Ateek’s reluctance to distance
himself from his rhetoric likening Is-
raeli treatment of Palestinians to deicide
and genocide.
