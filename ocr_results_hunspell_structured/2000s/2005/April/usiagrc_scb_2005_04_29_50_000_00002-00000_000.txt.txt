Students, faculty petition
for budget transparency

JustSex organizes
Take Back the Night

at DILARA YARBOUGH

“Take Back the Night Week" is part ota national
campaign during the month oprril, Sexual Assault
Awareness MonthThis year's “Take Back the Night"
was organized by JustSex, the antirsexual assault
group on-campus. The events included a seminar on
how to interpret rape statistics, an antirscxual assault
training for men, a screening of the ﬁlm Rarncnrrcriug
Angela Shel/1771, and the annual rallyand match around
the campus and community.

David DeGeest’Oé helped organize the events. He
cited the prevalence of sexual assault in Grinnell and
around the
world, and the
silence survir
vors of sexual
assault are of-
ten expected
to uphold as
reasons for
hosting Take
Back the Night. “This is just such a pervasive part of
everyone’s life, and we’re always 50 Silent about it,"hc
said. “This is the one place and one time that it's safe
to talk about it.”

One of the highlights of the week was an anti-
rape training for men put on by male students vise
iting from Virginia’s College ofVVilliam and Mary.
Grinnell was the fortieth and final school the speak-
ers visited on their nationwide tour. Mark Henry ‘05
attended the event. “They showed us a pretty graphic
video, and they were very blunt with statistics and
with facts about rape," he said.

“They tried to touch onjust about every aspect of
sexual assault from before the incident occurs. to afs
ter,"chry said. Presenters told men how to deal wrth
possible perpetrators as well as victims of tape.

The strategy orinen talking to men is “an anomaly
in the movement," said Domestic Violence Alternar
tives/Sexual Abuse Center intern Helen Carey ’04.

”This rs/ustsuth a pervasive part
eleven/ones life, and we’re always
so silent about it.”

From April 10 to 16, students collected signatures
for a petition asking the administration for more clatr
ity in the budget process. Daniel Furuta ‘08 and Laue
ren Standtfer‘07 wrote the peti on based on demands
proposed by Wayne Moycr, Political Science.

“It started in the aftermath of the tuition hike," said
Furuta. “We thought the SGA’s response was good, but
we thought we could do better.”The petition demands
greater transparency in the budgets
making process.The petition states
that the signers "believe that it is

ever increasing tuition rates when
students and faculty are not only
essentially excluded from the deci-
sion making process, but are also
deprived orinrormation concerning the budget.”

The petition asks that administrators publish a re-
port covering the petitions issues and make it available
to taculty and students.Thc report would appear when
the proposed budget from the Campus Budget Steers
ing Committee is presented to the Board of Trustees
Budget Committee, then again when the Board ﬁnal-
izcs and approves the budget.

Furnta, Standifet and others intersted in the cause
collected faculty signatures for a similar petition the
week before spring break. They hope that the admin
istration will be more likely to grant the requests of
united students and faculty members,

About 850 students signed signatures the student
petition, and over so on the faculty petition. Many of
the faculty signed the petition with a note saying they
did not agree with the wording, only the demands.

Cassie Donnelly ‘06 and Standifer met with Vice
President of Institutional and Budget Planning lonnr
than Brand on April 15 to talk about the petition. “I
was really optimistic [after the meeting],” said Standi-

He’s very enthusiastic about budget transparency and

cess.

Brand said that much of the information the
petition asks for is available in various places on the
college website. The annually
published College Factbook also
answers frequently asked ques—
tions (FACLs) about the budget.
On April 21, the administration
posted the FAQs about next year’s
budget at aoruaogr inite/[edﬂﬂrey
inrtizuzionrzlp/mrhing/Zooohurlgcr.

“The questions about ﬁnancial aid are not Conﬁ—
dential,” said Vice President of Student Affairs Torn
Crady when asked about one of the petitions de
mands, “In tact we will probably provide more infor—
mation then requested so students will have context to
interpret the data."

“From my mind. I think we have a transparent
budget process that includes both faculty and stu-
dents," said Brand.

The budget for 2006 was ﬁnalized at the trustee
meeting in February.

Standifer said the petitioners would prefer the
information be organized in one place and easier to
find,

According to Furuta, the intention of the petition
was not only to give students the ability to fight the
tuition hike, but also away to show the administration
that students and faculty are upset, He explained that
it is an especially good opportunity to show that smr
dents are displeased with some of the administration’s
policies, “since it is a relatively dry issue."
