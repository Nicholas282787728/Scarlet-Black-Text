What if Grinnell hose the pope?

Every Semana Santa (Holy Week). those in todo el
mundo puts avmy their minirskirts, cigarettes and stops
making out and arms very, very catholic. Thousands
ofrnen,women and children don long tunics, and con-
ical hats under masks (looks a lot like the KKK, actu»
ally), hold huge candles and parade through the streets
at night for six hours at a time followed by groups
ofAO men hauling two-ton ﬂoats topped by th’
size polychrome figures of Jesus and the Vir-
gin Mary, The community and a whole ﬂock
of tourists come out every night of Semana
Santa, year after year, to demonstrate their
heartfelt, ittemporary, religious zeal.

For a very religious holiday, rhc whole
week has crazy, boisterous feel of Grinr
nell before the last election. Btlt like
the election, no matter how much cf—
fort goes into it, tragedy struck. Span»
iards have mourned the death of Pope
John Paul 11 and eagerly await the arr
nouncement of the next pope.

Spain's population, a secure bastion ofcatlrolicism,
will have about as little echct on the choice as Grin-
nellians wrll on the Supreme Court justice appointr
merits during Bush’s term if any of the justices can’t
hold out. Since Spaniards and Grinnellians are feeling
somewhat disgruntled and disenfranchised oflate, let’s
pretend that we all are the cardinals who will chose the
next pope in the conclave starting Monday So, we’re
the leaders of the Catholic Church and we're going
to review the likely candidates based on criteria that
matter to us: social liberalness (stance on contracep-
tion/divorcdgays/women as priests), popularity, racial

diversity and religious tolerance.
Both Spaniards and Gtinncllians will have to con-
tent themselves with different degrees of conservativ-
ism; there is no viable reformist candidate to be found
Pope John Paul appointed 114 of117 cardinals, apparr
cutly a prerequisite for appointment was an outright
condemnation of the use of condoms, even for the
frghr against AIDS. as Spain found out earlier this
year,
This caveat effectively
ruled out most everybody
with socially liberal
leanings. But, since
Spain wants to have
protected sex guilt—
frcc and Grinnell
would like to see
a pope who's not
so stiff, we need
to pick the most
moderate of the
bunch. Out of the running is Caldinal Francis Ai'inzc
ofNigeria. He wants women who have had abortrons
to be denied Communion and has accused gays ofun-
dermining the family. Slightly more promising is Cnr~
dinal DlonlgiTettam‘ 2i ofMilan, who spoke in sup
port of anti—globalization protesters but is also good
buddies with the ultra-conservative Opus Del, which,
for all ofus who read T/M'Da Virm' err/e, is just creepy
By my estimating. Spain’s younger generation would
be okay with Cardinal Angelo Scola of Venice, who
participated in the Communion and Liberation move
ment and is tolerant ofproglessivc Catholic groups,

If Spain would be content with a moderate with
Scola, Gtinnelhans would be ecstatic with the liberal
and witty Godfried Danneels ofBelgium,who unfor-
tunately doesn't stand a chance. But even irnone of
the candidates are socially liberal. lots ofthcm are nice,
which since the death ofJohn Paul ll,is becoming one
of the deciding factors.

in effect, it's become more and more a popularity
contest,based on wlro’sclosesr to rhepeople,oreven the
cutest and most cuddly. The latter
trait I believe should be important
for Grinnellians who know very
little about the Catholic Church
and might as well judge based on
appearances. and it already is Very
important for Spaniards, who are
very touchy. Tettanianzi is by all
accounts the cutest» short, plump,
warm and huggnblc, if, that is, it’s
okay to hug a pope.

Scola spends a lot oftlme hangr
rug out with the people and is big on youth groups. On
the other hand, Cardinal oscar Rodriguez Mrradiaga
of Honduras ls unpretentious, gets along well with
people and promotes the elrmrnation ofThird World
Debt, but, most importantly, hot friend with Bond,
so he's Grinncll's obvious choice. Cardinal Chlistoph
schonborn of Austria is not as much ota people per-
son and doesn't always play nicely with the bishops.

Even my rather racist host mother said she’d infr-
nitely prefer Arinzc over a grumpy Viennese.
