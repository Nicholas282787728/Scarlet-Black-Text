My usual music taste falls into the “inclincholy
white hoys" category, so I would never have vcnr
tilted near Ratatat's sell'rtitled album (categorized
as “electronic/tcchno/intlie rock") had it net been
playing at Bob’s Underground oire raterui night
last seiiiestei. The smooth, eclectic electric sounds
emanating from the stereo were so entrancing that
I folind olit the name of the band and immedir
ately bought the album upon returning to civiliza-
tion over whiter break. It is the band's first album,
although the sylitli-wiclding duo (two youngish
guys from New York) was formally known under
the less edgy name “Cherry" for several years,

Vietnam war is raging and
Martin Luther King, Jr, has
just been shot, Bur it is also
very typical ofthe troubles fac»
ing a college kid in any era He is an adamant Red Sox fan and has

When the Columbia chapter of Students for a Democratic

Columbia's involvement wrth the War and its segregationist poli-
cies, Kunen decides tojoin the protesting students occupying the
Presidents other. But l<unen, whose “principal association with
the left was that [he] rowed port on crew," is not quite the revolu-
tioiiary that the title suggests.

Kunen becomes part of something, but remains uncertain of
what that something is. He doesn't take himself or "the move
meat," too seriously; ire knows Ire is a college student grappling
with life's complexities. But life's complexities do not seem to have
changed very much since Kunen wrote in 1968: “we’re unhappy
because ofthe war, and because orpaverry and the hopelessness of
politics, but also because we sometimes get put down by girls or
boys, as the case may be,or feel lonely and alone and lost."1 doubt
that I am the only one at Grinnell to identify with those words.

After the “liberation”ofthe Columbia office buildings cnds,we
follow Kuncli’s mental as well as physical journey through 1968,
He witnesses police beating up students on their own campus.
He attends peace rallies and hitchhikes to Canada to visit draft
dodgers. He even finds a girl to accompany him on his expedition.
(Because what would a story be without a leading lady?)

Kuncri’s conversational tone is filled with both witty sarcasm
and a hope that is very much alive, He wants to believe that the
world can change, with or without a revolution. He is a smart and
funny writer and draws the reader in quickly. Perhaps my only
criticism is that the book ends quire abruptly It’s a great read, and
