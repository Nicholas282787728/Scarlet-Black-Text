Learning
culture
through
comics

Students in Japanese Comics and War
roleeplay characters living in Hiroshima
when the atomic bomb was dropped dure
ing World War It. In the process, they gain
a greater understanding of the culture

BY CARL FALCON

can comics be rrsed to reach history? Can role playing oraut

you a view inro a culture? Marnie iorenhy, the head ot the Japanese

department, thinks so. In her course, Japanese Comics and war,
students create characters in world war 11 Japan and role-play
through the characters’ lines up to when the atomic bomb hit Hie
roshinia.

The students read selections about Japanese culture and indi-
vidually present various mung/i (Japanese cornice). Through this,
they gain an in-dcpth View oftlie culture and life in Japan during
VV\’\/II,]orcnby said.

As a final project, students create comics,
essays or short stories about their individual
characters and present a testimony to the class,
iii character, about what it was like being in 1 lie
roshima when the bomb was dropped,

“We discuss both the cultural/ ‘ otical
significance of the manga and its arti it mer-
its,’ 'Jorenby said. To create their ﬁnal projects,
members of the class must understand comic
art form as well asJapanese culture,

In class, students discuss ieadings and listen
to lectures, but it is outside of class that they
explore their characters Students are organized
in iivc different Ham (Japanese for neighborhoods), The groups
mcet and play through various scenarios, such as what to do with a
woman who cheated on her husband while he fought in the ai my,
saidJorenby.

“It is sort oflik: five classes rolled into one, said David Bar-
nett ‘08, “It's an art class, a history class, a toleeplaying game and a
craft ofhistotical ﬁction class Bainett described what the class as

g‘radually unfolding Which is appropriate he said since those rn
Hiroshima did not really know what was Coming.

‘birst we learned about the histoiv otJap an during Vl’orld War
11 and made our characters, then we split into Ham antl began
meeting," said Barnett'l‘he Hair meetings (rolerplays) are done in
the Forum, and the transcripts arc_posterl on the course website.

classes at Grinneli, because i found
it effective in helping students gain

Then: i' no limit on what kind of characters the students can

ay; they simply must be culturally accurate. Men must wear

' ' ,cn's uniforms. and women must wear workpmtts (1710711341).

Besides the clothing, though, students can decide everything else
about the chaiacters. _

Character-s include monks,a tattoo artist, a gunsrriith,a schoole
girth a wounded soldier who sees visions, a kimono i ' r, a bull-
dog, a mythical tiger tish (a macro) an orangutun-r g fox god
namcd Baba- -Yngn and a cloud, said Jarcnby.

Toward the end of semester, students will literally burn their
cliat:lctets,Tliis is intended to simulate the dropping oi‘the bomb,
Students will design their own rituals for burn-
rng their works. Jmcnby said she has normally
done this somewhere outside on campus.

,iorenby said her approach to this class is simi-
lar to rho “tecrcaring the pasr" program at Bernard
College. There are several differences between
Bernard‘s approach and iorcnbv's, liowcvei.

ln Bernard’s program, students are limited
to historical roles; in Joreiiby's, students create
their own characters. While students at Bernard
rolerplily in c1ass,]orcnby's students meet with
theii neighborhoods outside of class.

students are responsible for creating web»
sites for their neighborhoods and characters. These websites have
recently become available on the cla. website (“Project Hiroshie
