ﬁg THIS WEEK

- Vice President Chris Ochoa brought two resolutions to Joint
BoardThc first proposed online prcertgisrrarion. Senators expressed
support, since online pie—registration would be easier for students
studying off-campus. There was also concern about the online sys-
tem‘s effect On the current advising system. The second resolution
recommended placing a PrCard reader on Bucksbaum. Senators
were worried about what factors would determine who was given
access. Ochoa responded that students curicntly raking art classes or
students with professor permission would be allowed access.

' There was some discussion about the Health Center's lack of
weekend hours. Senators were especially worried about the avail-
ability ofPlan B over three-day weekends. No pharmacy in Grinnell
will provide Plan )3 without a prescription,

~According to the President’s Report, ITS has tentatively agreed
to move into the Forum basement. This frees up previous off—cam-
pus ofﬁce space. Students with ideas about how to allocate the space
should email their suggesrions ro President John Bohman.

- Bohman also reported that the “waiting list clause" has been
struck from the Strategic Plan.

. A draft document on gender-neutral housing is finished. How-
ever, it is not available to the public at this time.

- President Osgood said the proposed campus pub in the new
campus center was “cool.” Bohman said administration believes the
pub will pay for itself. The pub is likely to appear within the next
two years. One suggestion included putting the pub next to Grab ‘N
Go. However, Bohman quipped that students would “not be able to
'grab beer and go."

Derek Bates '08.

Republicans worked over the weekend put up
posters with the positions of both 1st Ward candi-
dates, “We wanted to let students know about each
candidate’s key points, and actually make an informed
choice,"Bates said. “In a non-partisan election,where
partisan issues aren't a concern, I don’t think it was
right to look at party and not policy."

Many students may have disregarded the cams

g ASK THE PRE

Why did you come to Grinnell? Why did
you stay?

I was asked to be President and was happy to accept. I came
and then stayed because 1 like the fact that Grinnell has only one
mission: to be a ﬁrst rate liberal arts college. I think this gives us a
focus and a sense ofselfthat is stronger and more holistic than a
research university which has multiple educational missions. I also
stayed because i found this a wonderful community in the wide
sense of that term, students, non»college residents, staff and faculty.
I might add rhar for almost all of my life I have lived [in] relatively
small towns and I like them and I particularly like the ethos of care
ing and mutual respect that pervades Grinnell.
