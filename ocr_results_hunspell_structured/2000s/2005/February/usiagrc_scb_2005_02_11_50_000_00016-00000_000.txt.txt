Women’s and men’s teams con-
tinue home stand on Saturday

BY KEVIN BYRNE

For some coaches and some teams, it would be
difficult to ﬁnd very many positives in a season that
has produced a srla record overall this year. This
is not true for Andy Hamilton and the Pioneer
women’s basketball team. With five of those losses
by eight points or less, and a team that is currently
leading all of NCAA Division III in three-point
ﬁeld goals per game with 11.2, there are plenty of
positives for this squad.

“First, we are still playing hard late in the sea
son,” said Hamilton, "second, we are pretry good at
home, and third, we are improving even in the final
days oi the Campaign."The team's latest sign of im-
provement came last Friday when the Grinnell

It seems that Grinncll men’s basv
ketball is a unique animal with its
own cieation, evolution and life story;
full of twists, turns, high points, wins,
losses, three point shots and tragedies.
Ovci the past dccadc or so it has
grown and built a name for itsclfas a

all conventional basketball gurus. on
Thursday night, Dec, 3, men's baslscre
ball had another turn in its life story.

With the new Darby gymnasium
packed tight and at fire code limit,
ESPN Z televising live, the Harris
theater acting as a satellite viewing
area, and Grin-

Giinnell was given
its chalice to shine
to the world as the

basketball team to be shown live on

season. spotlighted for their rapid
substitution scheme, high scoring
games and for launching more three
point shots than any other team would
even consider taking, the Pioneers lost
toss to visiting centerence foe Ber
loit under the lights and cameras on
Feb.3.

The game itself was an oddity in
more ways than one. Grinnell and
Beloit, both sub-.500 teams, were on
national televison thanks to Grinnell‘s
propensity for highrscoring games,
and Thursday’s game, by Grinnell
standards at least, was decidedly not
highrscoring. Grinncll’s 85 points
matched their seasonelow, and Beloit's
85 was the secondefcwest Grinnell
has surrendered this year. To add to
the irony and strangeness otthe game

disappointment for Grinncll fans, was
loud, energetic, tense and exciting for
both schools.

Beloit drove up several tan busses

these dueling forces
the crowd dynam

many teasing and

exchanges. Even
before the men's
game started the
Grinncll side began chanting “Our
house," which was quickly followed by
a Beloit, “You just lost,“ commenting
on the women’s game that had ended
moments before. These taunts then
took off to a more personal level with
Grinnell students’ “Safety school" and
Beloit's biting "One and seven" (Grin-

The game irself was heated, with
Grinnell falling behind early in the
first half, unable to make the three
poinr shots necessary to make their
tactics Work.They shot 13 for 52 from
beyond the three point line (six for
30 in the first half) and under 30%
from the field for the game. (In the
end Grinnell lost despite attempting
45 more shots than Beloit and forcing
32 turnovers.) The Pioneers led 10-2
early but went into a slump and

Construction
ongoing at Darby

BV DAVID MONTGOMERY

Grinnell's new Darby Gymnasium was seen
by the nation on ESNPZ as a vibrant building
filled with enthusiastic fans. Outside of the play
ing area itself, however, the new athletic complex
is far from complete, With construction set to
continue until sometime in May, fans and players-
have to stiffer through several inconveniences for
the next few months. ,

Basketball players have lteenly notic
unfinished state of some of the gym’s fate s.
The team locker rooms aren't finished yet, though
several toilets have been Iiggcd up for players’ use.
“We take our showers in the PRC, walking back
and forth." said basketball team captain Eric
Walsh ‘05,

Athletic director Dee Fairehild said that the
college "knew they would be without lockers and
meeting rooms" for the gyms ﬁrst basketball sea—
son: “The construction was doubled up to get the
gym ready by January 21," Ftiirchild said, “Not
everything could be finished."

Another consequence of the ongoing con»
struction is du‘! “They've done a good job of
cleaning in the gy itself," said Walsh,“but when
we leave the gym in breaks, it gets pretty dusty."

JeffPhelps, the owner of the Saint's Rest cofe
fee shop and a frequent visitor to Grinnell has
kethall games, had an encounter with some or the
dust after attending the inaugural game on Janu-
ary 21 against Lawrence University Phelps lost
his voice after that game, and several days later
coughed up a solidiﬁed piece ofwliat his doctor
said was construction dust, “I’ve noticed dust at
each game an the seats,"Phelps said, adding that
he had also come down with a sinus infection at
the time and wasn't sure how much of his sicke
ness was due to the dust.

“We still have a problem with dust," Fairchild
sdid,“sincc it is sti r construction site."Sii\ce the
facility is being u d for games while constmtr
tion continues, it's impractical rig up huge plastic
sheets or other measures to keep all dust out of
Darby gymnasium.

Despite these problems, however, the new
Darby has received strong praise. Phelps emphm
sized how beautiful he felt the gym was. Walsh,
too, had good words for Darby. Despite loving
to play at the old Darby in previous ycars,Walsh
said, “I love the new gym, especially because of
the new lighting.”

According to Fairchild, the college has tried
to recreate as much of the feel of the old Darby
that fans loved so much. "The torches from the
north and south ends of Dal-by are inside the
new building, one in the lobby, the other on the
west ofthe gym,” she said. “The honor ‘G' from
the old gym‘s ﬂoor is now on the new gyin’s wail.
From everything I’ve heard, it gives the old Dar»
by feel. "
