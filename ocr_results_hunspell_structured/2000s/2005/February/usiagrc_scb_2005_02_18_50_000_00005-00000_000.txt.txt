Student’s ‘stain painting’ on display

Katharine Smith '05 exhibits artwork from independent study last fall

av CID STANDIFER

For Katharine Smith ‘05, “Little
Green Monster” was an initiation
into an entirely new way to use paint.
This small amoeba-shaped heasr re-
sulted from the merger of a dlSSAUS’
tying previous painting and leftrovcr
watered—down paint from another
work.

Smith poured the liquid green on
a treated gessocd canvas, tilted it one
way and then another, allowing 518“,
det tendrils to form, and ler it dry.

“It was the result or that play rhar
opened [my] eyes to working in a dif-
ferent fashion,”said Smith.

The experiment in which “Little
Green Monster"was born is known
as “stain painting," in which the art-
ist waters down acrylic paint to a thin
liquid and pours it over the canvas.

Many such washes are used, with
spills of various sizes, to make the
colors overlap and mesh, allowing
deeper layers of paint to peer through
and till! the ripper stainsThe method
was pioneered in the 19505 and 605,
but Smith, having never studied these
works, progressed in a drrectron all her
own.

After ﬁnishing her ZOO-level
painting class, Smith decided to ext
plore stain painting more in depth in
an independent study with Professor
Bobbie McKibbin, and graduated
from working in the studio to a gi-
ant blue tarp in her apartment, where
she pioneered methods otcontaining
paint ﬂoods using ice-cube trays.

“My dream is to have a poured
concrete working space that has mul-
tiple drains on the ﬂoor,” she said.

But while she was toying with
damage control methods to save her
carpet, smith was also manipulating
space, emotion, paint density, gravity
and, most importantly, color. In her
artist‘s statement, Smith explained

that “decisions about rhe color in-
formed choices of form and the coins
position emerged accordingly."

In some cases, the choice and at»
rangemeiit ofcolor have a striking ef-
fect, as in the painting called “First,”
where an intense red mark dripping
and expanding down the center of the
painting dominates the mild yellows
and oranges that compose the rest of
the canvas.

the paint to slide off, Create unique
effects, as in "Big Green," Here the
paint seems to defy gravity.

The painting is hung horizontally,

left edge ofthc picture.

While most of Smith’s paintings
are entirely abstract, some are inspired
by places, people or events that are

Smith said remind her of the aereoe
grammes her sister Marion sends her
from Lesotho, where she is stationed
as a Peace Corps volunteer,

Smith, however, doesn't entirely
plan the details that give her paintings
an organic life or their own. Most of
her decisions are made spontaneously,
With little idea as to what the end re
sult will be.

“Some of the excitement is the
surprise or how it ends up,” she said.
"It’s a rewarding process because i

I could produce."

Smith’s paintings are on display in

“Stains,” ends on March 4.

No business being good
mD Review
Sir

William Shatner

Release Date:
10/5/2004

William Shatner’s CD, ”Has
Been”, has no business be-
ing any good. This is the
same artist, after all, whose
cover of ”Lucy in the Sky with
Diamonds” still gives me night
terrors. But it’s amazing what
having Ben Folds produce
your album can do for you. In "Has Been", Shatner samples
a broad array of musical genres in his own unmistakable
style—speaking the lyrics over musicr Believe it or not, this
works. With guest appearances by artists such as Folds, Joe
Jackson, and Aimee Mann, "Has Been" is at once addictively
fun, sublimely moving and wryly amusing.

Shatner wrote most of the lyrics, including the henetic
rant "I Can’t Get Behind That” with Henry Rollins. My per-
sonal favorite songs on the album, though, are the ones in
which Shatner steps back and has a good laugh.

If you listen to "Has Been” repeatedly, though, it’ll be
because of two Standout Songs: Shatner's better-than-the-
original cover or Pulp’s "Common People," and “That’s Me
Trying," the elegant reconciliation song (unwritten with
”High Fidelity” author Nick Hornby. And ifShatner really is
a ’Has Been’, then he puts it best himself in the title track:
"Has been—might again. "

Wolfe’s style is as readily appar- of the Vanities
ent in this novel as it is in his most
famous work, Bonﬁre of the Vanities.
He teaches inside the world of the people about whom he is
writing and follows everything from their stereotypes to their
slang to their pastimes.

He immerses his audience so far into the world offighter
pilots that he covers the legendary Edwards Air Force Base and
the story of Chuck Veager breaking the sound barrier as well as
the slew of records set by the many amazing pilots there.

Wolfe even shows his audience the negative attitudes of
these famous pilots towards the "ballistic approach" to space
travel and the passengers who somehow surpassed even the
men at Edwards as the nation's greatest pilots.
