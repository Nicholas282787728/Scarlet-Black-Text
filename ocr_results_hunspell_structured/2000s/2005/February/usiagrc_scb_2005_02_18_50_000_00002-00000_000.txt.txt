Five computers stolen
SInce November

3v MAC POHANKA

Last week Steve Briscoe, head of campus secliriry,
released a crime alerr warning students and faculty
to lock their computers because of recent thefts on
campus. Since November, four laptops and a desktop
computer have been stolen, as well as several memory
chips,which were removed from computers,

Two laptops have been taken from student dorm
rooms, and two more laptops have been removed
from other buildingsThe desktop was taken from an
academic office on campus.

Campus Security is still conducting investiga
tions into these thefts by contacting local pawn shops,
websites such as Ebay and othei markets where the
thieves may try to sell the computers.

At the time of the interview, Briscoe said he was
unsure of the exact details of the recent incidents and
could not say how the number of thefts compared
with past years without looking through past records.

To avoid the theft of more computers Security
advised snidcnts to write down the serial numbers of
all computers and expensive equipment. Briscoe also
recommended locking dorm rooms, office doors and
laptops.

Washington, cum. from p.

raising, but said there would be no help
in the form ofpassed bills, Moffett said,

The Development Group is also
focused on revitalizing rural Communi-
ties, according to Motion. "1 am trying
to find ways to develop some of the
towns in the county, not changing them
into anything that they‘re not, but pre-
serving their integrity and ﬁnding ways
to keep them from deteriorating," he
said. “Some small towns in Poweshiek
County are sufrering.”

Moffett wants to support Main

Street projects and local start-up busi»
nesscs as well current businesses that
want to expand, he said The Congres-
sional Delegation seemed very recep-
tive to that idea."

According to Moffett, one of the
trips miLln purposes was to introduce
the Congressional Delegation to the de-
velopmcnl group and gauge their sup
port “The trip was successful, and we
were able to put whatwe were doing up
in front ofthem and their staff,"Moffett
said. “It put us on the map with them."

 

EKI, cont. from p. l

interdisciplinary work, we want more
diversity [but] we also want cuirent
faculty to feel that it is a growth op»
portunity for them. We want to hire 12
new people, but we don't want that to
mean, you came too early to the party,
but these new people get to do hot
groovy stuff,"l3rown said.

Interdisciplinary course-
work

According to Andrews, interdis-
ciplinary coursework allows people [0
look at topics from a variety of discis
plinary perspectives. In practice, the ins
crease of Interdisciplinary coursework
could create multiple paths to the ful»
fulmenr or major requirements, as well
as encourage students to reach across
department lines to enhance their edu-
cation.

Forexample,Andrcws said hewould
like to see more interaction between
the English department and foreign
language departments. “We’ve stayed
away from teaching literature that's in
translation, bur we also have a foreign
language requirement, so it seems to be
that we could do a better job of validat-
ing the rationale behind that foreign
language requirement."

Sophomore retreat

Another idea proposed by the EKI
is a sophomore retreat designed to re
energize students about the values of
a liberal arts education before they de-
clarc a major.

“The liberal arts is attempting to
understand the world around “5 fl om a

variety ofdifferenr angles and perspeCs
tivcs," Wayne Moyer, political science
professor and chair of me EKl com-
mittee said. “We want students to think
broadly beyond their disciplinary major
and give rhern new tools for thinking
about things [and] new questions to
ask.“

“we would want to have people
focus on what [they are] going to do
with those other credirs, how [they are]
going to make sense of that relative to
the[ir] major, and how it is going to ﬁt
in terms of [their] personal goalsmm
drcws said.

lIlnplementing EKl propos-
a S

The next srep in the process is see
liciring more feedback from faculty and
students, making revisions and eventu-
ally presenting the proposal to faculty
members for consideration.

The focus groups provide a forum
in which faculty can express their opin-
ions on different parts of the proposal.
one of the parts of the EKI is climis
nating concentrations and providing
minors to try to encourage students to
minor in something instead of double
majoring. But BroWn said there was
signiﬁcant opposition to this proposal
in Monday's focus groups.

“Some elements [of the proposal],
like expanding faculty, are going to take
some time irwe do it right, so we're not
sure what that rimeline would be, but
you could see some things emerging
fairly quickly," sorror said.
