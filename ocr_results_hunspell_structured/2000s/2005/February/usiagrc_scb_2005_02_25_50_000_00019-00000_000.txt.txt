Life is tough when
you’re a Korean
monk. Or a vampire
hunter. Or even
worse, a teenager.

Spring, Smmer, Fall, Winte nd Spring (R

This remarkable Korean film,
rccted by Ki-duk Kiln, began making
the American artrhouse cinema rounds
a couple ofyears ago. It received some
critical acclaim but, like most art—house
ﬁlms, quietly lost the spotlight after a
few weeks.

But this film deserved far more at
tention than it received. As far as the
plot goes, the film is not particularly
complex, apart from its unique ﬁve-act
structure. The ﬁlm follows the lﬂami’ﬂ’
tion of a single monk from childhood
to his adult years, played by several die
terent actors, including Kim himself.
We see the boy and his mentor, an adult
monk (Oh YoungrSOOL pass through
the five seasons suggested in the title,
though many years actually pass.

The combination of masterful cine-
matography, committed acting and deft
visual direction elevates the ﬁlm be
yond standard melodramatic elements
into the realm of emotionally compel-
ling filmmaking.

The entire movie is set in a ﬂoat

ing monastery on a Korean lake. It is a

simple and eternal setting, not a land

scape overflowing with artiﬁcial nature
manufactured to impress an audience.

several spiritual symbols ﬁgure

importantly in this monastic world.

Though the premise is Buddhism, the
emotions and interactions are universal,
and one does not need to be an expert
on Buddhism to appreciate the film.

Spring, Somme]; Fri/1, Win/m, and
Spring is not a particularly cheerful
movie. In it we see the natural coir
tinuance of life, but we are also given
the corollary visions of death and suf-
tering.

However, the film never wallows in
misery, or stretches things to a point of
incredulity. Rather, the film gives us
a look into the inherent dichotomies
or life: beauty and savagery, joy and
misery, compassion and violencball
kept in an almost perfect balance. To
capture life so vividly requires a careful
orchestration of many elemenrs oflife,
from the very large to the very small,
and Kim succeeds admirably.

As in any ambitious aim, ﬂaws are
inevitable; however, in this ﬁlm, i ulti-
mately find them too inconsequential
to be worth mentioning.

There is just so much to love, from
scenes of unearthly calligraphy to ones
ofsimple travel across the ever-impor-
tant lake on which it all takes place. It
is a film about love, tragedy and the
never-ending cycles or life,

Mechlowicz) and onewith two Gay Dads (Ryan Kel-

l Here's the setup: Culkin gets beat up by Fat Bully,
so Culkin whines to Older Brother. Older Brother
and Brad Pitt come up with a plan to embarrass, but

are no adult characters in the movie, which provides
an interesting dynamic, because the high schoolers,

Should you watch this ﬁlm? Yes, and here‘s why:
Vampire Pomeranians.

Not convinced> Okay, how about TriplcrH in his
film debut? He’s got a charm about him that says.
“Hey, if it worked tor the Rock, it can work for me.
Plus I do big and dumb yet lovable really well.”

Or perhaps you would enjoy playing the How-

In the third gem of the Blade triology, Blade

the “Big Bad.”The “Big Bad“ as it were. happens to
be Hollywood’s latest rendition or Dracula—Drake
(Dominic Purcell).

After being woken froin his ancient slumber,
Drake pisses and moans about the lack of honor in
the vampire race, kills some goth kiddies for crimes
against eyeliner and black hai dye, and then declares
war against our title character.

As in the two previous films, Blade channels his
inner-Shaft (shut yo’ mouth!) and goes mano y mano
with the granddaddy of all bloodsuekers—but the
question rema .will he win and thus save mankind
froln the grips ofvampiredorn?

A shining point in this otherwise uninspiring ﬂick
is the much—needed wit and sarcastic banter from
Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). And in an uneie
pected rolcschoice, also starring in this underwordly
piece is Natasha Lyonnc, which by default torces me
to approve this film as anything she does is golden.

Despite being an hour and halflong commercial
for iPods and black swishy clothing, the appeal of
Blade. rim'ly remains as it ever was-- things/people
exploding, corny onc»lincrs. eye candy and guns. Real
big ones.
