Friends Forever Mix Tapes Club and Grinnell Audio Club share mixes of their favorite songs

av BEN WEVL
Grinncllians love music. Grinnellians are also very
proud ofthcir musical tastes and like to shower others
with said good tastc.thn you put rhese rwo axioms
together, you get the two latest clubs at Grinnell dea
voted to spreading musical diversity.

Friends Forever Mix Tapes Club

The Friends Forever Mix Tapes Club is run by
John Chavez ‘05. Members send an MP3 to Chavez,
who puts cvetyone’s song on a tape. Everyone who
sends in a song will get a mix rape of all the songs
submitted.

“It’s a good way to find out about what other
people are listening to and what their favorite songs
are,” Chavez said, “We're going to do it at least two
or three times this semester." Chavez started the club
last semester but said he was too busy at the time to
make the tapes for everyone. He said that he has more
time this semester and is looking forward to making
the tapes.

Chavez is a member of a few different subscrips
tion tape clubs, to which people can pay money and
get a new rape every month. Chavez started the club
on campus because he “really liked trading tapes with
friends," he said.

The Mix Tapes Club is open to the whole campus
and even has a Plan; the username is [mortapes]. If
people want to obtain a copy ofthc first mix tape be»
ing sent out, they should send their song to Chavez by

SaturdayThc first tape will probably comc out a wcck
bcrort spring break, according to Chavez.

Chavez received money from SGA for 100 tapes,
which he believes will cover enough people for the
rest of the semester. “It should be fun,” Chavez said.
"We just srarred it to have a good time and listen to
some music."

Grinnell Audio Club

The other music swapping club to hit campus
is the Grinnell Audio Club, which, according to
emails, is substitled “How I learned to Stop Wore
rying and Love Other Music."The Grinnell Audio
Club is run by Ben Cohn ‘08.

This club has about 35 par- _
”it should be fun. Welusl starred ll

{0 have a good time and listen to

ticipants. Each person makes his
or her own mix CD, and every
Wednesday, each person passes
the CD they had the previous
week to the next person on the
list. Eventually every CD will be
passed through the rotation.

Cohn thought up the idea ovcr break. “I just 6-
mailed a bunch of people to see if they wanted to
share some mix CDs. I know a lot ofpeople here have
very different musical tastes and Ijust wanted to ex—
plore that."

One srudent participating is Erin Sindcwald ‘08.
She said she immediately thought it was a great idea.
“You’re exposed to lots of different music, and it’s

some music”

something to look forward to every Wednesday," she
said,

The original list included about 20 people whom
Cohn thought ofduring winter break. Through word
of mouth, the list has grown to about 35 members,
and it is open to the entire campusr‘Tt's getting to a
point where we're rhinking of passing twice a week,
because with 35 people we won’t make it to the end of
the school year,” Cohn said.

According ro Cohn the club has been passing
CDs since Feb. 2 and it is going well. “I’ve been re
ally happy with it. I’ve already heard some really cool
things just from the CDs I've heard," he said.

Cohn also said that he does
not do much CD swap-enforc-
ing as coordinator of the club,
“I never intended to manage it
at all," he said. “I just depended
on people to participate if they
signed up for it, and it seems to
be working pretty well."

Sindewald said that at ﬁrst she
did not receive her CDs but after a gentle reminder to
the person before her on the list, the trading has been
going more smoothly.

“I encourage people to go ﬁnd the person theme
selves and be assertive in a nice way," Cohn said. “I
think it's a vehicle for selﬂgovernance in a way.“

or BEN WEVL

Most elementary school students believe their
teachers live in their classrooms until they see them in
a supermarket The same may hold true for Grinnels
llans, at least until an awkward meeting at McNally’s.

But many professors not only live outside their
classrooms, but in different communities. For End
Bateman, economics, and Victoria Brown, history, liVa
ing about an hour away from their offices and class
rooms produces advantages and disadvantages, as well
as a lot of hours in the car,

Both Bateman and Brown
moved from Grinnell for family
reasons. Brown began teaching at
Grinnell in 1989 and moved to Iowa
City the following year, when her
husband got a job at Cornell College
in Mount Vernon, east of Iowa City.

Bateman has been teaching at
Grinnell for 18 years and had lived in
Grinnell for 15 years when a family
medical emergency prompted the
move to Des Moines.

Three and a haltyears ago, Bateman's oldest child,
who turns 17 next week, was diagnosed with leukemia.
“During the ﬁrst year he had some medical emergens
cies and none of them could be addressed here, some of
which they tried ro address here and once nearly killed
him," he said, "At that point we decided that the only
safe thing to do was move to where his care was .. , It
“as not a‘let's get out of Grinnell’thing."

According ro Bateman, his garage is out miles
away from Carnegie Hall, which means about an hour
ofdriving. He usually commutes to Grinnell four days
per week, he said. This year, for the ﬁrst time, he has
been carpooling with Kesho Scott, sociology.

The carpooling has deﬁnitely been a boon for
Batelnan. "The first two years, after doing all the drivr
ing myselfI got physically exhausted," he said. “Both
years I would just be physically depleted and some
thing would come around, and I would get really sick,

siry into a virtue.”

”ll things had been different, I
would have been happy to live in
Grinnell We tried to turn a nettle

but not this year,"

In order to carpool with Scott, Batcman said he
changed his schedule, leaving later in the morning
so that Scott can make childcare arrangements. Now,
instcad ofswimmiug ar noon in the PRC, Bareman,
gets up at 5:00 am to swim at the YMCA. He said he
rarely arrives home before 6:00 pm.

Brown said her commute is about an hour and ten
minutes. “The drive itself does not bother me, because
I am a Californian, and therefore I bless the fact thatI
don’t have to get on the freeway and wonder if there's

going to be traffic," she said. “The
drive itself is a piece of cake be
cause you know how long it's going
to be. It's always the same.”

Although the driving does not
frustrate Brown, the lost time does.
“The time I spend on the road, if
I let myself think about it, bothers

Victoria Brownhistory me," she said. “My daughter was

chastising me last year for [work

ing on] a Saturday and said, ‘You
should take the day off] said, ‘Elizabeth, I spend
eight hourt a week on the road. some people call rhat
Samrday.’

“I have to use the car as a place to relax," said Brown,
“50 I listen to books on tape and I listen to the radio
and I talk on the phone. I would say that it adds an
ext-m stress in my life and cuts into my relaxation time
and my time for anything in my community There's
a cost.”

Brown does not come in on Tuesdays and stays
overnight at the Phoenix every Thursday. ”Sometimes
I'm home by dinner, but I'm often home late at night,
so it costs me dinners with my husband also," she said.

Brown said she usually leaves around 7:30 a.m.
and returns home at varying times. on the night she
talked to the 5558, she arrived home at 10:30 pm, and
on Wednesdays, when Brown has Executive Council
meetings, she gets home around 9:30 pm

Despite the long drive, for both Brown and Bates

Two profs weigh the advan—
tages and disadvantages of
living an hour down I-8O

man, living in a larger town has its advantages. Irslte
lived in Grinnell, then work would be all around her,
Brown said. “I love Iowa City as a community,l don't
get to be as much a part of it as I’d like to, but I still
love it,” she said, “I like living there because it gives me
a little distance."

For Baremau, moving to DesMoines opened up op
portunities for his family He appreciates Des Moines‘
restaurants, art center and schools.”The schools in Des
Moines are immensely better than the schools in Grins
hell,” he said. “We didn’t leave for that reason. But we
had another reason to leave and we discovered a much
better education for our kids. And as an educator, that’s
really an important thing.”

But there are also disadvantages to living in Des
Moines, according to Bateman. “I wanted to teach at
a liberal arts college. That was my life ambition, and
part of that was that 1 was always at basketball games,
always at soccer games, at this, at that. And Ijust can‘t
do that anymore," he said. “I tell myself the move is nor
responsible for all of that. I have kids that are 16, I3
and seven, My kids still love to be here, but they have
lives of their own and don’t want to follow me around
campus."

Bateman had been an active member of the Grins
nell community before leaving. “I had a very rich life in
this community," he said. “I was active in Boy Scouts,
coached soccer, and I was active in my church. Now it’s
a different time of my life."

Bateman does not foresee returning to Grinnell.
“For physical reasons and for my job, it would be wone
dcrﬂll to move back, but I don’t think my kids want to
go to school here." He said he would be close to retire»
ment by the time his kids graduated and that it would
not make sense to move back afterwards.

Brown said she would not be opposed to living in
Grinnell if it were not for her husband’s job. “It has
worked for us as a family accommodation," she said.
”Iftbings had been different,I would have been happy
to live in Grinnell. I‘ve tried to turn a necessity into a
virtue. So I've embraced Iowa City.”
