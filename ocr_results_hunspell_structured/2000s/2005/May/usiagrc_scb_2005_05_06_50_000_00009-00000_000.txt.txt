Parting thoughts

lryon are reading this because you
are expecting me to present you with
sortie sort of ivlsdom or sage advice,
you might as well stop reading right
now. I really don't know anything.

My utter lack of knowledge
was brought to my attention
this week, as Sarah Butcher
and I struggled to make sense
of “lthdca,” the nex-t-to-Iast
chapter of Ulyurt,

For the sake of the 99
percent of Grinnellians

of“1thuca": Basi-
cally, the chapter
is a series ofquesr
tions and answers, each answer lead-
ing to another question.

Let me explain that for the past
year or so, I've been plagued by the
same huge, utterly terrifying and
paralyzing question that every upr
pcrclassmen has heard at least a few
times: “What are you going to do after
graduation?"

Parents, rclatives, friends, profess
sors, and strangcrs were all suddenly
way more interested in my life thari
I wanted them to be. It felt like the
Spanish Inquisition combined ivrth a
CI’OSS’CXﬂmlnMiOH.

l began to wonder if the whole
world just liked to watch rue squirm.
I responded using var-ions tactics; Sill"

fun"), delusional rantrsy (“Writing

Don't get me wrong; I’m thrilled
to be going to Greece. However, my
future still feels anything but safe.

I realize that all ofthis analysis and,
literary allusion maltes me seem like a
hopelessly abstract English major, but
in many ways 1 am a hopelessly als-

lege bilt a chance to fullyembracc and
develop onc's hopelessly abstract side?

One reason that I'm an English
major is that it's always comforting to
realize that siren if

that someone else
has already done it

What the hell docs defining po-
litical struggles in terms or “up and
down" mean? I'm not sure, but liC’
cording to Alex Muller’s letter to the
editor last week, that's what the West
docs. Actually, Muller summarizes
Bernard Sharvs explanation in order
to contrast the Muslim view of per
lirical struggle. Muslims, all one bil~
lion of them think“ in terms ofnearer
versrrs further away—that is, nearer- oi-
rrrrtlrcr away from Allah’s path." And
then there are the Chinese who think
upsidctdown, Hindus who only do
what’s best for their cows, and Eski-
mos who plcfcl snow to pcoplc. Ok,
I’ll stop being sarcastic. Muller docs
not stcr-corypc the Chinese or Hinr
dust

Muller's letter is annoying because
he believes that the Palestinians are
crazy to believe they are in the right; it
is infuriating because he believes that
wc can only understand their position
it we understand some peculiarity in
the brains of Palestinians (or all Arabs
or all Muslims), Remember, we need
Bernard “Doc" Shaw to tell us how
Muslims think.

Later on in the lertcr, Mullcr res
ports on a poll of Palestinians which

asked them something about what,

kind of democracy they would like.
Muller does not quote the exact word-
ing ofthe pool.

However. he does quote an Israeli
journalist who analyzed the poll data
and somehow reached the conclusion
the Palestinian preferencc for a dc-
mocracy like Israel's shows they want
to conquer "the other."

Muller does quote one “influential
Muslim” who sounds paranoid to me.
However, the Muslim is Iraqi/m. For a
Palestinian perspective,1 recommend
Edrvard Sard‘s T/Je- Qm'rliau IIfP/rlcr-
fine. It’s dated but still very good.

Bernard Shaw can save his breath
trying to explain the peculiarities
of Muslims. For me, the issue boils
down to one consideration. 100 years
ago, the vast majority of the people
in modern Israel were Palestiniansi
when did they lose that land, and was
it taken rrom them by force?

If so (as l believe it was, with
much accompanying death and sur-
faring). understanding why somconc
would want to support the nolwlolcnt
maioriry or the Palestinian uprising is
not hard.
