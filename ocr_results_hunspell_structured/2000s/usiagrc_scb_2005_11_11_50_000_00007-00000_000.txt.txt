head a bit further east next year.

When the Joe Rosenﬂeld ’21 Campus Center opens non year, the
Forum Grill will be moving to the new building and adding an ‘c'to the
end ofits nanic.The new Grille will be locatcd between thc new post
ofﬁce and the multipurpose room in the new Campus Center, near the
ﬁreplace lounge and across a courtyard from the central dining area. A
balcony overlooks the seating areaihe new Grille Will be approximately
twice as large as the current
one in terms ofseating capac-
ity and serving area.

”It’ll look a lot like what
we have lier'e,"said Mary Kirk,
Dining Services assistant d‘l’
rector in charge ofthc Forum.
“The look is really based on
[architect Cesar Pelli’s] deﬁnition of how he thought the students
would be served better."

Another big change coming is expanded menu offerings. Though
the same dcli sandwiches and pizza will be ottercd, new equipment will
allow for the making offried foods, such as chicken or ﬁsh sandwiches,
smoothies and espresso.

Students have reacted positively to the planned menu changes.

"It's good they’re adding things to the rnenu,"said Caitlin Monaghan
'09.

“I think we have enough
fried tood already," said Darcy
Ward '09, “but I like the idea of
a smoothie."

other students are skeptical
about the centralized location.

“I really enjoy being able to
look out on this part orcampus
at the Forum,” said Andrew
Yuan '09. “It's really nice. I don’t think Mac Field has the slime feel to
it."

The move ofthe Grill is tentatively planned for early next surninei.
Current Grill Sniff hope to get the new Grille open before the school
year starts to avoid problems.

“We’re hoping we can get started with serving the customers"
as early as July, said Kirk, “Ii won't bc such a ‘evcr-ybody star-ling on at

food choice to
Improve With
new “venues”

Constantly cycling menus ofchicken patty par-mesan,
lemon pepper pollock and smart Dogs will rotate therr
way out thisJune. In their place will be up to 10 different
“venues" at each meal offering tnried types offood.

Main meals will have stations for varied types foood,
including grilled foods, pasta, carved meats, international
food and vegan tootl. Breakfast will have the popular
“eggs to order" strrtron currently at Cowles and Quad,
and rvatnos in addition to regular food.

According to Dining services Director Dick Wile
linms,thc student center will try to keep “as many [venues]
open as possible"every day. allowing students to eat the
food ottheir choice whenever they want to.

These changes in food service are designed to ac-
commodate those at Gi‘inncll whose diets are restricted
by culture, health or personal choice. “it's hard to be a
vegetarian at Grinnell," said Lauren Trdd '09. “It seems
like they keep on repeating the same foods again and
again, and I’d like something more than just ditrerent
options ofvegctablcs."Tidd also voiced a concern that
the mass production of food may mean that “the food
isn't strict vegetarian."

Fortunately for students, this mass food preparation
will not be an issue under the new dining setup. The
change in food service will be accompanied by a diﬁere
cnt kind or preparation. currently, each dining hall has
two cooks in the back or the cafeteria, preparing food
in mass quantities for students. Next year, most food
will be prepared to order in front of the students at each
particular venue

Many colleges across the country are practicing the
“venue"approach to dining. So far, Grinnell students seem
to View it in a positive light.“I'm kind ofdisappointed I
don’t get to stay," said Dining Services employee Christine
Vigeland ’otr. “They’re coupling the changes with a wage
increase, so I'd be getting paid a lot more next year."

New year will also see the beginning of a lowstat
station to accommodate healthrconseious students and
keep the nutrition more balanced.

SGA President John Bohman said that Dining
Services will also be looking at nutrition as well as taste
next year. Due to the lack ofa nutritionist on campus,
Boliinan said that food is often "not a good balance."
Though the administration does try to bring local foods to
the dining hallsifor example, the eggs used in the “eggs
to order" station this year come from local farmersithc
smaller producers cannot always deliver the food asked
for by the College.

“It’s really what‘s awrilable,” said W illiams.“I'm look-
ing for new producers, local producers and talking with
different sources to try and stay proactive."
