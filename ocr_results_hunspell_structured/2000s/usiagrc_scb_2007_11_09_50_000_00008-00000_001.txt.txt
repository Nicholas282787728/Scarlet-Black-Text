themselves there to the room hung with an
American flag, an Iowa ﬂag and three quilts

During the final question, Edwards’s rc—
sponsc to the topic of how the universal
healthcare plan turned personal, as she spoke
about how preventative care for her breast
cancer eoulrl have saved money and her life,
“Insurance companies should have been sends
ing the a letter every year saying, ‘I know you
haven'r had your mammogram'But they didn’t
because they mnted to save money on the
mammogram. Well, it didn’t exactly save them
any money.”

The following is an edited transcript of
some of the questions and answers between
Edwards and the audience. Her actual re

sponses were much longer.

:What'sJohn's opinion on the eonsoli-
dation otpower by the president? What's his
position on signing statements,vvire tapping,
the suspension ofhabeas corpus?

Edwards: The last two rhings you men-
tioned are illegal and not only would John not
engage in them, he would
make sure no ﬁlture Zld’
ministration misconstrucs
them in any way.

Q This is a guess
tion to test your sense
ofhumon lfelectcd, will
you make your husband
walk with a Carolina
stroll rather than aTexas
strut?

Edwards: (laughs)

cynic answer is yes.

Edwards: As somebody who's spent 12
years chasing this man down sidewalks, I
know he is much too fast for either Texas or
Carolina,

Edwards: Well, one of the
things that John proposed to
do with respect to universal
healthcare plus plans would be
to provide for dental care.The
very notion that caring for
teeth is not essential to caring
for health is clearly wrong
John covers vision as well.

Q What’s your husband’s
stance on gun control?

John was born and raised
in the south, people all around
him, his family, used guns. He
believes in the Second Amend‘
rnent, lie doesiir believe in
AK-47s.There are some limis
tations, a lot of people view it,
gitimate exclusions the Second
Amendment anticipated—the hunting they
want to do is—and those things are perfectly
acceptable... We also have to make certain
that they're using technology in the right way
Turns out the shooting at Virginia Tech which
raised a lot of peoples’ ire was not a failure of
gun control, it was a failure of technology.

Obama takes on the issues, and a twenty-something

BYJAMES ANTHOFER

on oct. 12, the only thing keeping Barack
Obama from the crowd w a couple of blue
curtains and some black dividing ropes. Ginnr
American and Iowan flags hung in the school
gym against the south wall, each one equal to
the other, almost to signal the prominence of
this smaller state.

There was deﬁnitely a sense of some the
versity in the audience at his speech, which
put some teeth into Obama’s almost mantra-
like devotion to the idea of unity in politics.
A few high schoolers in tootball uniforms and
cheerleader’s outﬁts sat near the corner where
most of the cameras were set up. Middlesagcd
grey haircd ex~hippics mingled with the an-

cient. classically cynical caucus voters, who
manage to look impassive at most every turn
of phrase.

A middlesagerl bearded intellectual gave
the usual pumpsup speech that seemed more
intelligent on the outside than its cookie-cur-
ter, redsstatc, blue-state divide message in the

ANew option
for would-be
caucus-goers

School to open PEC gym for
student sleeping Jan. 3

With the Iowa caucuses earlier than ever
this year, the administration and Campus
Democrats have been working hard to make
sure that students who vmnt to come back to
campus early to participate can participate.

Campus Democrats leader Alec Schic-
renbeck ’09 has been heavily involved with
the process to get housing for students that
want to be involved With the caucuses. Schies
rcnbcck began talking over the summer with
Dean of Student Life Jennifer Kruhn about
the possibilities for students wanting to return
to participate in the lowa caucus. "We’re ti)"
ing to arrange cars from across the counrry,"
said schrierenbeck. “We want to get people
here, check in, work on their campaign, caus
cus, watch the returns and stay together that
night."

Because campus is closed for winter break,
and the caucuses are so early that it will be im
possible to open up campus, campus Demos
cmrs reached an agreement wirh the admin-
isttation to allow students to stay in the PEC
over the night oflan, 3,

“Basically, we want to get students here,
provide housing and no put demands on staff-
ing,"said Ktohn.With the campus being shut
down for winter break, only security and two
RLcs are typically onscall during break.

“Jennifer has been really great in this pro-
cess,” said Schierenbeck,“'l'here's been a lot of
resistance, but Jennifer has been putting this
plan through."

Though schierenbeck and the Campus
Dems are sponsoring this event, emphasized
that the entire student population can take
advantage of this agreemenr to return for rhc
caucuses. “Everybody is welcome to come
back early, no matter who you caucus for," said
Schierienbeck.
