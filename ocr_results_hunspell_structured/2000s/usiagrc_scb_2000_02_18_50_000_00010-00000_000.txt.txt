Focus on Local Policy: The Capstone

BY DAN ROTHSCHILD
STAFF COLUMNlST

For the last year, we’ve been hearing
on and off about the relative merits of
Capstone projects. On the one hand, they
present an intriguing opportunity for
Grinnellians to put together four yezlts
of learning into a project which reflects
the breadth and depth of a liberal arts
education, Their critics, however, claim
that they lack focus and that the college
simply doesn’t have the faculty resources
to cover these projects.

Another crtitiCism which was
launched against capstone: last year is
that they are an effort by the college to
emulate the senior honors projects ofthe
effete eastern schools upon which many
Grinnellians proudly look down their
noses. This criticism seemed to have died
out, until this newspaper reported last
week that “The longvterm goals of the
program. .. [were] articulated after a Visit
to Swarthmore College last year,
Capstones, with their loose similarity ro
Swarthmore’s upperclass honors pro-
gram, represent part ofa movement by
the Executive Council to emulate the

small Philadelphia school.”

Hold on here.

For the last year, the Grinnell admine
istration has had as its battle cry the not
tion that Capstones are not intended to
emulate any aspect ofeast coast preten-
[l0n,Tl16 Sfm'lel d"B/m‘/e, however, seems
to report ir differently.

It's undeniable that the entire
Cupsroneexperieneeis-psrtofGrinnell's
effort to rationalize and “Fix" the fact that
it's not a “Top Ten” liberal arts school by
rhe v.5. Nrwr llmllWor/[lkeﬂarl rankings,
as itir’s somehow embarrassing to attend
a school ranked number eleven. The fact
of the matter remains that Grinnell is
still the secondehighest ranked school
not located in a coastal state. Our gradue
ates still get accepted to the top gradu-
ate and professional schools and enjoy
careers in the private and public sectors,
working in business, government, not-
forepl'oﬁt organizing, medicine, law, and
a myriad ofother positions.

More importantly, we like it here at
Grinnell. The fact is that most of us,
should we have chosen to, could have
been accepted at a “Top Ten" school. We
chose to come to Grinnell for a host of

diffeient reasons. The school is by any
standards topenotch, and for many ofus,
the fact that we wouldn’t be subiected to
the cffete snobbery found in New En-
gland wns n key selling poinr.

The merits orthe Capstone projects
are debatable. As they stand now, they
completely inelt focus, Ale they supposed
to be interdisciplinary or storngly fo»
cused on a major or concentration? Do
we really have enough faculty to support
these prolects without gutting the 200
and 300 level curricula? (The Chemis-
try department certainly can’t handle
having all of its majors do their mandae
tory research here in Grinnell; are we go
ing to have to outsource Capstones as
well?) And, for goodness sake, how can
sophomores andjiiniors really participate
in a program which is supposed to he
rhe apogee ofa Giinnell education?

I will leave the relative meiits and
disadvantages ofrhe cupsrone project
to be sorted out by John Aetni, Eliza-
beth Dobbs, and the other persons in-
volved With the Curriculum Commite
tee, My point is this: we came to
Grinnell to go to a small, midwestern
school, We are not here because we

Couldn't have done better. We are not
here because we wanted eastern pte»
tention brought to our doorstep. were
certainly not here for the active
nightlife.

We’re here because we fell in love
with a school in the fields oflowa, No
matter what the adininistiation’s inten-
tions may be. the number one way to
turn offthe campus body and keep the
anti»Capstone ﬂack flying is to equate
Capstones in any way with schools
other than Grinnell. This should not
be an issue of comparing our school
to other schools two thousand miles
away, Just as there is Virtually no com-
petition among Grinnell students for
rank in class and GPA, there should
be no competition between Grinnell
and other schools for inclusion on a
largely aibltrary list which is statisti»
cally biased against the south and
midwest,

A visit to Swarthmore shouldn’t
“becoming the nation’s
best liberal arts college.” Let's be origi»
nal, let‘s be daring, let’s be adventur»
ous, Whatever we do, let’s not be some»
thing we’re not: the east coast.
