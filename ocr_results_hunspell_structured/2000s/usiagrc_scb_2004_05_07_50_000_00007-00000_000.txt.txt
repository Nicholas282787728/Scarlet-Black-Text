be Ah, rinal issue. \yirli my last eoherenr potrndings
on my keyboard of mu seinesrei, let me recommend to
you all oftliese movies, but also many ofthe ﬁne summer
ﬁlms she multinational corporations have made for you.
Especially thesequels. This summer, we have Slate/e 2, Hrmy
PatterAndi/irPnianll'quz/eabﬂll, T/Ie Chronic/z: after-rider,
SpideveMrm 2, CHM/177711111, T/re Emmi! Sir/newly Alienr
north Predator, Before sinner. Eromrs- The Elgiriliilig and
The Primers Dinrierzr The Royalfug/Igemml. I her four of
those will be good.

Have a good nnals week.

The Dreamers (NC-17)

B: That is not a misprlns; a “dirty picsure" is showing
tonigit at Harris. To make up for bringing Peter Pan and
In Amzrim, films chair Rachael Dreyer foists a tale of boy
meets girl meets her brother. In Bed. In Paris. In 1968.
Amidst rho srudenr revolution, anAmerican exchange stu

dent (Michael Pitt) bonds with user of French twins, boy ,

and girl, over their love orhlm and each others hot young
bodies. And the sex continues,

K: I have no idea why this dirty little lliek has made its
way here. Maybe it's here to arouse some sensarion from
Grinnell students whose minds have gone numb and dumb
by rhe end oFHell Week. Let's pray rhe movie clualiry is
good enough ro prove that a melnageqﬁ-Irois srudy break
can be just as rewarding as pancake, puppies and babies .

B: What, a little sibling snuggling now shocks the girl
who recently opined about the beauty of Kill Bills bloode
shed? And i think she numb and dumb Grinnellians will
probably be at the Forum at eight to see org/l. We all get to
see Michael Firt’s penis: so whar> The real travesty is that
initially that penis was going ro be played by Jake
Gylleiihaal. I mean, doesn‘r Donnie Darkos premature
evaeuarion diminish his credibiliryinyour eyes, somewhat?
i mean, even his sisrer Maggie has been naked on film,

All rlns Gyllenhaal gossip should rip you onto rhe iacr
rhar no, I have not seen this movie yer. But I will be the
nrsr one in the audirorium for rhe 7-30 show, because I’m
projecting it and because it's a conrroversial work by an
awardvvinning auteur, Bernardo berrolucci, who I’ll give
rhe last word in all this sex talk:

BB: “After all, an orgasm is better rhari a bomb."

Mystic River (R)

b: In bosron lie the decaying remains orJohn Adams,
John Hancockt Crispus Amiekt, die Curse oFthe Bambino
(I hear this is the Red Sox’s year), as well as manyunmarked
bodies dumped in Mystic River. Beyond the Freedom Trail,
Fenway Fork and absurd eoncenrrarion orcollege students,
there is a darker side to the Athens of America.

This meditation on loss of life and child(hood) by d.i—
recror Clint Eastwood follows several darkprererring shady
characters,Thrce schoolboy pals (Sean Penn, Tim Robbins,
and Kevin Bacon) ate thrust back into each other’s lives
after a tragedy (read: someone dies). And rhe foreboding.
tense atmosphere, which started wish the black opening
credin, continues.

K: let's see, we have the star power, rhe Oscar hard
ware, the script based on a best seller, the controversial see
cial issue. ahh, what uh I say? Mysm Riwr is definitely the
best and darkest movie of2003.The whole movie is packed
with suspicious faces. events and the darkness of the soul,
which made me shudder to think oh“ the American people
rharl have mer, bur thars why we par cowboy Clint on the
shoulders and say “good job!”

B: Or you can just say “eh” like me. I’m truly ambivae
lent about ll/I]m'rRi'r/:r.'l'hesrory is ﬁne and is intentionr
ally slow and piedlctable. Penn, Robbins and Bacon are all
solid acrors who won'r give you the urge so shrow your tree
popcorn ar the screen, but here they re all too overdramarie
I didnt rind the movie eithei plodding or powerful Just
about everyone else in the world loves this ﬂick, rliough so
you should probably listen to them Just this once,

Gigli (R)

B: In theory, Forum movies are one arrempr by SGA
to provide non-alcoholic activities for people who like ro
sit around in the dark. In praeriee, though, rhore’s no way
anyone will go see Ciglr'wirhonr being drunk oiirheir ass.
since slmrt»r€l'ni memoryand rhe ability so Follow a con.
versation and by extension a plot, are the ﬁrst things to go
when rraslied, I won't bother you with a plot, beyond this:
ben and Jen suckr A lor. Arleast diat’s what Conan o'brien
says, And the jokes eonsinue.

Shadow ofa Doubt (R)

K: Yay, Finally a very good courtroom thriller arrives
on campus i remember seeing this movie a long time ago
with such satisfaction; however, like any excellent
wliodunnit, it's not run warching it again bemuse you know
all rhe answers. It’s impossible to put rhe plor inro it nor
shell, so I'm nor going to tell you what it's about and have
you cheek rhis our. Caution: watch wirh your eyes and
ears wide open!

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the
King (PG-13)

K: Everyone knows LOTR, even professor strauber
quoted Frodo in class the other day This time, “the jour»
neys ends,” as the ragline reads Beautifully ﬁlmed yet
strangely tedious, LOTR, especially the third one. will go
down in history as die most boring mustrsc; the grand
eultural phenomenon of the early 2 ist century, Frankly, I
was deeply moved by one oi the roo many denouemenrs,
which is probably objectively rhe most neutral one in tertns
oirear inducingpower: rhehobbirs sdrinkondcheerscenc.
However, the movie takes too long to end Come see how
long it takes anywayl

The Last Supper (R)

K: starring Cameron Dias, not rated beoiuse oi‘lan—
guage, sorualiry and violence," sponsored by SGA, not
GCCF; so you can guess what use movie entails. Well, me
college kids iusr happen to be fond ofinviting controvcr»
sial people over for dinner and debates, then making them
disappear, after their “last supper," Does it rhrill you enough
after all those mindrnumbing Finals?

Hairspray (PG)

K: ..,T|ien theie is this lovely adorable musical ﬁlm
set in the early 60s about a teenager competing for a local
TV dance program. Picture yotirsclla rypiGIl 60s scene
and you have all its elements in the Educative Hairspray:
the rock and roll, the golden era of television, the me: ,5,
