Aid merits bold change.

Harvard University announced last
month that it is abolishing its early ndl'niS’
sion program. Their reason, according to
Harvard’s administrators, is that early ad»
mission puts underprivileged students at a
disadvantage.

Harvard is right
to point out this
inequity; early ad~
mission is an un—
fair system. But the
admissions process
is ﬂawed on many
levels.For Grinnell,
abolishing early
admission would not he the most concrete
way to help underprivileged students. In-
stead, Grinnell can take its own bold steps
to make admissions more equitable 'and
increase socioeconomic diversity, such as
recruiting more aggressively in low—income
areas. We must also remain committed to
being needeblind and be willing to provide

» signiﬁcandy larger merit scholarships than
our peer institutions.

Early admission programs are problem-
atic because they favor privileged students.
Students from wealthy high schools and
college—savvy families are pushed to ap-
ply early, which puts them at an advantage
since early admission students have a bets
tcr chance of being admitted. Most early
admissions programs, including Gtinncll's,
are binding, meaningr thttt students promise
to attend Grinnell if admitted. This works
against students who need ﬁnancial aid and
cannot commit to a school before compar-
ing aid offers.

Bur ir‘would be difﬁcult for Grinncll
to lead the ﬁght against early admission.
If Grinnell got rid of Early Decision, the
school would have a lower rate of accep»
tance by admitted students, causing its (1.8.
New: and World Report rating to drop.

Although many cringe at the idea ofhe»
ing slaves no as. New: rankings, a drop in
rank might decrease the number of talented
and active smdentswillirig to cometo col-
lege in such'a‘ remote location. "Wc can't afr
ford to ignore [11s. New: rankingsl.” said
’Dean‘ofAdmission Jim Sumner. -

IfGrimiell keeps Early Decision, know-
ing itrfavors privileged'students, we need
to compensate by doubling our efforts to

reach out to underprivileged students and _

schools.
We'can start in our own backyard, with
poor students in the surrounding Iowa

counties, some of whom get no recruiting
mail from the college 70 miles down the
road. .
Even closer to home, the Mesquaki set-
tlement in Tamil rarely sends any students to
Grinnell, although
it is only 25 miles

sion ofﬁce should
make a ﬁrm and
lasting cunncction
with fl‘L’ settlement,
such as a yearly tulle
tuition scholarship.

And the college
must continue to provide excellent ﬁnancial
aid. Grinnell is need—blind, meaning that we
guarantee to meet admitted (1.5. students’
full ﬁnancial need as demonstrated by dncu»
ntents like the FAFSA. Grinnell's liccdn
blind status is vital to the school’s commie
ment to socioeconomic divers‘r '

Grirmcll's merit aid program also inﬂu»
enccs the class makeup, sociaeconomicnily
and otherwise. Families’ actual ﬁnancial
need is often far greater than the need demo
ottstrared by the. FAFSA, and merit aid has
traditionally helped to bridge that gap. For
many low and middlevincome students,
Gtinnell‘s Luge merit scholarships set it
apart from other schools and play a large
factor in their decision to enroll.

But Grinnell has started down a danger
ons path of reducing meritebased aid. \c—
cording to Sumner, the trustees have decided
to begin devoting less money to merit»based
scholarships. As tuition has risen over the
years, the matimum meritehascd scholarship
of$15,000 has rcmaincd.the same, decreas—
ing the percentage of tuition that it covers.
The college spent less money on mczit aid
for the class of2010 than they have in previ—
ous years.

The reduction of merit aid will probe
ably hurt middle~ and lower middle—class
students more than it will hurt the poorest
students, but this could result in a polarizing
effect, making Grinncll affordable to only
the richest and poorest students.

The United States’ college admissions
system is ﬂawed and unfair. Harvard's deci-
sion has attacked one aspect of it. Grinnell
might not follow Harvard’s lead in abole
ishing early admission, but we must follow
their lead in continually striving to make
out admissions process fairer and more open
to students from all socioeconomic back-
grounds.

Iowan: Time to change

Republican members of the U.S. House
of Representatives, in their cffolt to convince
Iowa voters to keep them in power, rntentron-
ally duck mentioning that it is their controlling
majority that has given us
the moss in Washington,
In my tlistrrct, a supposed
champion of integrity,
Rep. Jim Leach, does a
quick pirouctrc around the
staggering and disgusting
performance of his party,
With a theatrical cluck of
his tongue and downcast
shake of his head, he says,
“a new scandal is emerge
ing almost weekly." As ifwc had not noticed.

Too bad this fine qualrty and these can.
dcmning words wete_not evident where it
counted—in VV‘JSlIinglOn in the middle oftllis
Republican mess. Now back home at election

hadnornon'ced.

Willi a rhealrl'ta/ (luck ofh/‘l
tongue and downcaslshake ofhl's
head, he says, ”a newscanda/ is
emerging almost weekly.”Ai ifwe

time, these politicians want us to forget and
stick them back into the same Republical‘r
controlled congress. in power, they can stay
the course with George w. Bush as he keeps
our brave troops standing
in risk ofbcing cut down
in an lraqi hail of death
and destruction.
If we do not demand
change, whoever will?
on Nov. 7, please vote
with me to send a fresh
team to Congress to ﬁght
for us. Elect Democrats to
a new Congress to strug~
gle mightily to set things
straight and to advance a course that offers
hope to us and our children.
