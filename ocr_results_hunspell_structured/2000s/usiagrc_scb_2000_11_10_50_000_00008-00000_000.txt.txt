I consider myselfa studious guy. 50 when the seem.
ingly equally studious institution of Gn'nnell tries to
break my studious ways, i naturally get a little upset.
! live on North Campus, and 1 have all three years
I’ve been here. I'm prettysure l've been all over North
Campus in my timethere, and i haven’t seen one place
north of Eighth Ave. for me to do my studying. More
mally this wouldn’t bother me and To just go study in
my cozy room. But suddenly this year I’ve become
unable to do anything in my room for longer than ﬁve
minutes before 1 either stort pacing aimlessly back
and forth or trying to figure the best escape route off
of the loggia, So I’m forced to trek to ARM to get any
work done. All i ask is cubicles on not Field, with

maybe a space heater or two.

Picture this: high school, two minutes before the
last bell rings. There's shufﬂing, there's‘talking, there’s
zippers. Most notably, there's an absence of atten-
tion paid to whatever the teacher is trying to say.
This is a scene that we all left behind in high school
along with all those other petty immaturities, right?
Sadly, no. Now, I realize this is a small (omplaint,
but it has so much to do with courtesy and respect
that I find it important. I cannot stand it when, at
about 3:04, the professors voite begins to be muffled
by those shuffles and zippers and otherindicators of
everyone’s overwhelming anxiousness to leave the
room. Our professors spend frightening amounts of
time and dedication trying to impart their knowledge
to us. We owe it to ourselves and to them to hang
around until they've ﬁnished their thoughts.
