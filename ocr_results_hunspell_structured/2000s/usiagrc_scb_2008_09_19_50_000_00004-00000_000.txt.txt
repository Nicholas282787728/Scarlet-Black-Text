There was no elephant in the room,ch 101. last Sunday,
as a small group of12 participants and several organizers rrret to
discuss issues orgcnder and sexuality at the stonewall Resource
Centers Ally Tra- ng.

Ally Trainingimorc formally known as the LGBTQ
LA Safe Space VVorkshopiis a program offered by leaders
in the LGBTQIA community that aims to change the way
Grinnellians think about language and be—
haviors, which may be oppressive or hurtful,

“Our goal is to educate people about

confronting oppressive moments."

Krandcl said she believes the workshops
are an opportunity for all in the community,
regardless of background, to rallt about is-
sues regarding gender and homosexuality. “It
doesn‘t matter what knowledge you have comrng in,” Ktandel
said. “Taking the time to come to the safe space workshops
shows that you recognize the way that all ofour behaviors can
be sexist, gendetist, and homophobic. [Everyone] can be in
those situations," she said.

workshop participant Emily Wax ’09 said she thought that
the workshop was an important way to maintain awareness of
issues concerning gender and sexuality.

Wax said she was encouraged by the atmosphere ofsuppott
and awareness that characterized campus after last semester's

help prevent the return ofii “business as usual" attitude toward
gender and sexuality.

The workshop provided a space to "use introspection to be-
come aware of prejudices, eliminate those and thus be able to
be an ally,"VVax said,

While the organizers and participants said training sessions
have been helpful, leaders hope to see more
progress. organizer Brian Peibix ’09 said
that actions such as putting up “sateespacel‘

ns is not enough alone to create a truly

Petbix said that one of the biggest goals
is spread g awarcrress of genderencuttality

Ally training helped spread their message through differ
ent activities. The Human Barometer was a activity in which
people were asked to publicly gauge their re actions by standrng
in a certain part ofrhe room, varying from strongly agree to

including differing urays of perceiving gender. helping people
see and analyze their own scrual identities, identrryrng privi-

The low voter turnout came along with a small pool of
candidates. As or the original deadline for senator applicr
tions, only eight people had applied for candidacy. Most clus-
ttrs did not have enough students running after the deadline
had passed, and Clangrala had none. For this
reason, SGA members actively recruited stu

"I think this really shows the lack ofintcrest," he said.

According to Schneider, the low number orreturrring stu-

much for the Board this year in terms of outlines and docu-
