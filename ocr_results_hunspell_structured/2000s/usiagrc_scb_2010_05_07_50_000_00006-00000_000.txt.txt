The last Cultural Films Committee Event of the year
features two things many Grinnellians have little to no
experience witheTransgender Cinema and Russia’s 1921
Kronstadr Rebellion. “Maggots and Men,"directed by Cary
Cronenwett, features over 100 trans actors reenacting a
relatively unknown uprising by Soviet sailors, civilians and
soldiers on the island ofKotlin in the Gulfnf Finland. The
film attempts to transport the audience back to a period
with scratched black and white 16 mm ﬁlm. An original
musical score that plays throughout compliments the nos—
talgic feeling. The film weaves 1920‘s inspired newsreels
with silent ﬁlm of the sailors' lives, narrated by a fictionalr
ized version of the rebellious leader. Srepan Petrichenko.

Cultural Films committee Chair Teri Geller, English,
chose the ﬁlm due to its ties to the currently taught semi-

will be taught next semester, “The History of Russian Cine

Crafty students sell their wares

Grinnellians sell homemade products and services to the campus community

BY CHRISTIAN CAMINITI

At the third annual Craft Fair, students were given the
rare opportunity to not only put their artwork on display,
but also put it up for sale. Homemade pieces ranging from
the culinaryitlny cakes and doughnuts, to the sartorialia
chainlink vest, to the practicalihnirr
cuts, were all showcased in JRC 101 last
Sunday for interested buyers.

Founded by Sidonie Straughnr
Morse '08 and Mallory Inman '09 in
2007, the Craft Fair was born to pro-
vide an outlet for student creations and
presentations. Spearheading the event
this year was Christine Grummon '11,
who has been an active member in the
Craft Fair since its inception and sought to maintain its
original purpose.

"The goals of the fair are pretty simple. The fair was

students and also give them the opportunity to display and
sell their work to the community," Grumman said. “The
craft fair is open to anyone who wants to sell stuff, with the
idea that people are selling things they've made themselves,
and students keep all the money they make."

Joanna DeMars '10 brought her
line of recycled jewelry to the Craft
Fair and sold individual pieces at 31
eachimaking more than $200 in
proﬁt. Likewise, Tad Boehmer '12,
Toby Cain ’12 and Nora Kostow'13
sold their psychedelic marble paper
for $1 per piece and earned $50.

“We joined the Craft Fair just to
have tun and show our work, out we ended up making more
money than we expected to," Kostow said.

lfnothing else. the craft Fair proved that being an arte
ist and making money are not mutually exclusive endeav-

creared mostly just to support the creative endeavors of on, at leaetfo, Grinnellians.

“I thought, what a great way to celebrate this complete-
ly new, totally different approach to the discipline, with a
film that actually does both of what we're doing," Geller
said. “That says something about a speciﬁc moment in
Russian history...that has potential for great transsexual
gender freedom.

Geller is excited to see a transgender ﬁlm that deals
with gender in a more subtle and artistic way.

"The problem with a lot trans films is they tend...to he
documentaries,"Geller said. “It has been a failure ofimagir
nation to think the way trans discourse...intersects with
great storytelling and this is one the few examples where
that really happened."

Artistitaily. the film is quite innovative by having a cast
of trans actors portray sailors who are traditionally viewed
as masculine. The result, as stated by the film's website is
a “film that redefines male, challenges the binary gender
construct, and intentionally creates confusion,"

By choosing to focus on the group as a whole instead

ofa few characters, the director creates a unique sense of
community. As mentioned earlier, the sole voice of the
sailor—Stepan Pertichenko—reads from letters in Rus
sian with his words subtitled. The actors are much more
important as a sum than as individuals. There is a striking
interplay between the human and factual aspects of the
rebellion as scenes of the sailors lives are interspersed with
the informative news reels that tell the audience all they
need to know about details of the revolt.

Running only 53 minutes, Geller believes the film gives
much more than it asks from the viewer.

“The whole point ofthis event is to do something that
is kind of intellectual, but it is only an hour,” Geller said.
“This is for people to keep their minds going but still be a
fun break and not take too much time away from work...
because we’re going into hell week."

“Maggots and Men" will be showing twice, ﬁrst at 4
p.m., Friday, May 7 in Bucksbaum 152 and then at 7 p.mt
Sunday, May 9 in ARI—l 302.
