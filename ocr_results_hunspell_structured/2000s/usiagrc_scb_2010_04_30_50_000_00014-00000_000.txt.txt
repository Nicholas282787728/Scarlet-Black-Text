Ryan Harris and baseball keep rolling Ultimate

1w DARWIN MANNlNG

Who doesn’t like the taste of an aged
French cheese or a delicate red wine that
has been sitting in the cellar for more than a
couple decades? simply put, there are things
in life that get remarkably better with age.
and the same can be said for the seniors
of the Gtinnell baseball team, One Mere
lot that certainly has the wine enthusiasts
craving more is Ryan i-larris '10—the senior
pitcher and captain for the Pioneers,

“First and foremost, Harris has pitched
phenomenally all year He works quickly
and has given our team a Vet) good chalice
to win every time he’s pitched; aid second
baseman Michael Goldficn ’12. His num—
bers speak for themselves—a 2.06 ERA, 5
wins in 7 starts, and 29 stiikeouts.

"I think Harris has just become mote
consistent as a pitcher. It is very unusual

tor hrrn to leave a pitch over the middle or

the plate, and hrs Changcsup is one or the
best pitches in the confetence,”.ard catcher
Mike Nodzenski '12,

This fine wine delivers much more than
pist rosy statistics He is also a distinguished
leader and always looks out for the younger
pitchers

“Hes a lighthearted guy, but hes realh

taking things serious when he needs to take

things serious, when the pitching coach
cant be around hes taken guys under the
wing, said Coach Tim Hollibaugh

“I talk to Chris Eckberg [ 13]D a lot about
being an athlete, Ben Pope ['12] i really
don‘t have to help very much. rve helped
Andrew Flatt [’13] because he's a left-
handed pitcher like myself, and I’ve helped
Andrew Myers [’12] with his control," Hat-
ris said.

Staminaia new dimension to Harris
gﬂmCihﬂS been easily adapted through
a stronger commitment to conditioning.
“Building up leg strength through runs
ning at least four times a week has been
key, because when your arm gets tired,your
legs are what helps carry you through the
game,“ Harris said.

This new facet ofhis game has allowed
him to Conquer his lateeseason struggles.

“I feel like he traditionally starts off
fast, and tapers towards the end, this one
season he put great effort into getting in
shape and it is ierllly paying dividends,"
Hollibaiigh said

Harris elaborated on the two most
memorable moments of his season to this
point The ﬁrst came in a game against st.
Thomas University in Florida, where he
threw a thairgeup right down the middle,
the batter hit a scorching line drive right
back at him and the ball just seemed to
find his glove.

“I didn’t really even see it and it prettv
inuch went right into my glove, that was
deﬁnitely the most scared I've been during
any game," Harris said,

The other moment came against Knox
college, as there was a popeup down the
ﬁrst base line, and Ryan Fletcher'11 came
running in from ﬁrst base. Harris didn't i-ee
member catching it but as he did, Fletcher
accidentally elbowed him above his left
eye,

”Coach Hollibaugh tried to take me
out of the game and i said absolutely not,
and I ended up striking out the next guy on
three pitches," Harris said,

Besides Harris, the other three cape
tains, Chad Takabuki ’10, Paden Roder ’10

and Etian Sollo 10 have taken on a lead-
ership role, Holiibaugh explained. In tact,
Hollibangh seerned pleased with the play of

uite a few of his seniors “Chad Christoff
E10] and Marshall Chavez [’10] have done a
greatjob embracing their role in situational
pitching innings," Holtibangh said. “And
Nate Pierce ['10] has busted his behind to
be able to contribute to the team this year,”

Thanks to the play of the entire team
this past weekend, Grinnell met their cxchs
tations by sweeping a doubleheader against
Illinois CollegeilorS and 4-O—assurr
ing at least a tie for conference and giving
them a record or 17r11,“0ur pitehing was
great over the weekend, like it's been over
the course of the year," Hollihaugh said “In
that second game we just grinded it out and
luckily onr pitching kept us in the game,"

Despite their successes, the men know
not to get too carried away and that] tl rev re~
any need to pricpli'c to play the same type
oi baseball with each game. The teams nest
games come in a doubleheader Saturdm,
May 1 versus Vloninouth College, at 1: ()0
and 3:30 p m

“I think we all reel very tonﬁdent going
into our weekend series, though I tlrrnk we
still need to play a tlean girlie, Goldﬁen
said “A51 long; as we dont give awai runs or
rail to take advantage or our opportunities

offensively, we should be ﬁne.’

The mentality starts from the coach, and
with the positive mentality that Hollrbaiigh
lays out it's no wonder the team is on such
a tear.

“I don’t think we’ve got to change any
thing," Hollibaugh said. “The only thing we
discuss is not thinking we’re unbeatable, no
matter what opponent we play."

This past Saturday and Sunday, in Arnes,
1A, the springtime air was filled with a diner-
ent aroma “What’s that smell’ It's Gtinnell‘,"
shouted the Men’s Ultimate Frisbee teamtThe
men's team, the Grinnellephants, traveled to
Iowa State University to play in the sectionais
tournament After a challenging round of pool
play on Saturdayiwhete the crrnneliephanrs
wentz- 2—their3 1 record on Sunday qualified
them tor the regionals tournament.

T he in st day tor the Grinnellephants, how
cver,didnt smell so street

“I felt on Satuidav we expected to do much
better than we actually did," said Glenn Clatk
10 It was realli {riistiatlnv We didnt even
beat ourselves, physically, we pier beat outselves
mentally.”

After winnino their tiist game against er~
ther College, Grrnneu fell to the University oi
Omaha Nebraska (UNO) in a close match
Giinnell went on to win against the Universrtv
of Iowa B team, and then lost to Iowa State
University.

We really drdnt play well. said Andrew
otto 10 we were just kind of disappointed
with how ﬂat we came oft“ ’

However, coming back on Sunday, the team
had a fresh attitude and went 3 1. “I will say,
despite Saturday, I was really proud of how wc
played on Sunday, Clark said. we canie out
after a tough day, lost our ﬁrst game on Sunday,
but then bounced back and won three in a row,"

The wins were especially sweet, considering
the Grinnellephants beat UNO, who had been
a disappointing loss the previous day.

Overall, the Grinnellephants ﬁnished
ﬁfrhﬁust shy orgetting their. to nationals.

“We qualiﬁed for regionals, but it will be a
long shot to make it to nationals,” Otto said.
“We just didn’t win enough games against
teams that are our size."

Clark agreed with Otto. “We’d have to beat
a lot of teams that are much better than we are,"
he said

Though the Grinnellephnnts consider mak—
ing the D111 National Tournament a poor bet,
they’re excited to play in the regionals tourna—
ment, which take place in Notthfield, Minn.
