FIVE PUB CRAW

nopoly over Grinnell college clientele

has been prrt on a hricflliatus during its
closure for renovation, there has been ample
campus discussion over where to find the next
offrcampus hangout. While some students
may choose to keep their patronage on carn-
pus by supporting Lyle’s or may simply wait
for the Down Under Pubs reopening, a few
brave souls decided to set out on an expedi-

Representing the greatest deviation from
the other bars in town, the influence of its “1,
remote inaction as a eotrce shop gave GCC a
posh feel. It wins our award for classiest stop
and would perhaps constitute the best venue
for a date.

Beverage Selection: Exccllent. With more
upscale beets such as Fat Tire, 312, Honkcr,
and Blue Moon, GCC did not disappoint onr-
taste buds

Price: At 54.00 fol a lo oz. beer on tap, it
proved a bit pricier than its corrnterparts.

State Street Station
Corner of 4th at State Street

With its intriguing mixture of tiki styled
décor (plastic palm trees, umbrellas, and other
beach themed furniture and wall hangings),
coupled with old-school strcct signs and
train related memorabilia reminiscent of' its
neighbor, the AScM cafe’, State Street Station
proved to be an interesting and relaxing first
stop ofthe tout.

Beverage selection: Limited. Withjust Bud,
Bud Light and Ambcrbock on tap along with
just a few basic bottled beers and liquors,
State Street is not necessarily conducive for
those sporting a sophisticated palette.

Price: Very reasonable. At 31.50 for a 12 oz.
mug, our stop certainly failed to break the
bank.

Activities: Standard. With a pool table, two
small televisions and a bingtrthemed game

uncharted territory. As a follow-up to a guest
column in last week's 5&3. along with a small
band of Grinnellians, we performed our own,
more extensive review ofthe lesserrkliown bars

each establishment an overall rating (on a scale
from one to five beers) factoring in beverage
selection, price, activities and atmosphere, we
came to the following conclusions:

dard pub activities would have been out of
place.

Atmosphere: aner, classy, and suited for deep
conversation. The GCC, with its lounge furs
nrture and attrcovctcd walls, is an appropriate
place for group homework, quiet cliattei and
relaxing with groups ortriends.

Rating: 4 beers. While it may be pct-tecr for
certain types for hanging out, its quietness
and 10 PM. closing time is not well suited for
those in the ‘gct ctunls' mood. GCC’s lack of
versatility contributes to its slightly lessrtlliur

(weekdays from 3:00 PM. until 6:00 P.M.),
the Station provides its customers with rather
typical bar activities.

Atmosphere: Laid back and generally
friendly. While there were few barrgocts
present upon our somewhat early arrival, the
patrons in attendance (one group of Grinncll
students and a few scattered locals), the very
friendly bartender, and moderate volume of
oldies and classic rock combined to create an
atmosphere conducive to relaxation and corn
Versation

Rating: 3 beers. State Street Station falls
short of spectacular, but its interesting in—
terior and easy-going atmosphere seems to
provide a setting conducive to an occasional
student hangout.

Lonnski‘s ._,,,.__
922 |/2 Main Street

DWDDD

At our second stop, we ran into several
familiar faces. Among Grinnell students,
Lonnski’s appeared to be the most frequented
site, Resembling an upscale diner, the bar’s
more contemporary feel seemed most suited
for a college hangout.

Beverage Selection: Excellent. With a wide
assortment oflcssrcommon beers on tap and a
broad range ofhard liquors and bottled beers,
the selection exceeded what any student could
have expected.

Price: Adequate. Considering the better qualr
ity of its drinks, $3.00 for a 16 oz. glass seemed
appropriate.

Activities: None.With its diner—styled theme,
pool tables or other such activities would have
scemcd somewhat inappropriate.
Atmosphere: Upbeat and trendy. A balance of
socializing students and locals and upttcmpo
music combined to create an enioyable night
out.

Rating: 5 beers. This venue seems to [amt

Rabbit’s Tavern u.

our experience could perhaps be best
summed up with the word, “uneasy". Met by
armed heads and glaring races during our en»
trance, Rabbit’s was a quick stop,
Beverage Selection: Limited. Like State
Street Station, it offers merely the standards of
the Busch family: Bud and Bud Light, along
with Ambelhock.
Price: While $1.75 for a 12 oz. beer is a not a
bad deal, it didn't make up for Rabbit’s dodgy

John and Gary's Gametime .
827.Wesc Street

At this, the last stop of our bar crawl, the
group's fatigue and consequential gooﬁncss
seemed to translate (at least for one fun loving
and more than slightly spirited grandmother
aged customer) into_ some sort of masculine ape
peal. Without paying attention to this particular
uncomfortable encounter however, John and
Gary’s showed potential as an enjoyable place to
watch the big game and toss a few back.
Selection: Limited. Once again offering just
Bud Light, Blldwciscr. and Ambcrbock along
with standard bottled and mixed drinks, John
and Gary's selection was not great,

Price: Very reasonable . 51,50 for 12 oz, glass an

Activities: Pool, foosball, and Various video

some hyperrcompetirive, shady individuals, at
least there is potential to be entertained.
