Get Into GIMP this weekend

BYJAMES ANTI lDFiZK

lfsmdcnts need a break from the weather
this weekend, they can head Inio [lac Mod:
inside Roberts Theater and enjoy GIMP’s
(Grinnell Independent Musical Productions)
fall musical.

Although, in terms of st and music, one
orthc largcrsscalc productions that GIMP has
put on, audience members should not expcct
the opulence typically associated with this Star
ven Sondheim musical. “It’s often performed
like a campy pioduction or a spectacle," said
director Caitlin Davies ’09. “[But] the quality
comes from
the themes of
the show and
the characters
and their rela-
tionships."

Both can,
ccptions of
how the show
shouldhepet»
formed and a 3400 costume and prop brrdget
contributed to the decision to put on a more
minimalist production.The actors and actress
es in the musical will wear modern dress with
one or two costume pieces (for example, the
baker will wear an apron over street clothes)
and the largest prop in tlie riiusical is an un»
adorned platform with four staircases on it.

The plot effort the Wood; revolves around
fairy tale convention's and characters like Cine
derella, Rapunzel and Jack and the giant, and
it twists together these threads into situations
both absurd and profound. "In fairy tale psy-
chology, the woods represent the place where
people go to battle their demons and find out
who they are," said Davies. “It’s where people
tend to find their identities and form new
family groups through friends to help define
who they are."

Because the Theatre department only
produces a musical evey tour years, GIMP, a

frve-year-old Grinneu instimtion, fills the role.
This year, though, the department has been
more involved, oircnng support in the form or
lights and scrs.And the show is being puton at
Roberts Theater, a more theatrically accessible
setting compared to venues like the Harris
Center and the Wall where past piodrrctions
wctc traditionally performed,

Rehearsals, similar to a typical largcrscale
Theatre department Mainstagc production,
lasted seven weeks, five nights a week, “Mir
sic is tricky and I’m a student and the actors
are also students, so we‘re still trying to learn

process and
timing," said
Davies, “Two
weeks of the
time was just
spent on mu-
,. sic,”
Roberts Theater . In re
hearsals, a
close collabo-
ration developed, making possible a musical
of the unique style and production of Imp rim
Wiwdr. Actors were encouraged to work to
gethcr and see parallel events in their own lives
and take that into consideration to add mods
errr, Grinnelllarr touches to the play. “GIMP
is great it’s more like we talk to each other
rather than the director talking to us,which is
more intimidating,” said Sumatra Slranlcir '10,
who plays Jack's Mother,

The actresses and actors in the product
tion have the largest role in communicating
this vision of what Inn; the Wom’r should be,
and they worked along with Davies to give the
musical the freshness and pertinence it needs.
Jon Richardson ’10, who plays Jack, observed
how this minimalist spin differentiates this
production from others,“1 think that it’s more
accessible to a college student audience and
addresses more of the themes on their radar
because ofthis production," he said.

Behind the scenes: a closer look at Films

Films committee continues to Change but the pesky projectionists remain

BYDRAKE BALLEW

Your average Grinnellian spends the
weekend in a variety of ways, Trips to Harris
sometimes figure in there somewhere, But that
building serves as more than just a central pare
tylocale; it is also home ofthe Harris Cinema.
And while students enjoy the end product,
they usually aren’t familiar with the intricacies
ofthc SGA Films committee's planning.

l’llams has worked this year to make itself
more accessible and continue popular events
from last year, like vidco game tournaments
and poker games. While
the committee still strug»
glcs with low attendence
and sometimes unreliable
ptojecrionists, it has im-
proved communications
with campus by opening
the committee to all, and
bringing

This year's Films chair
Anand Balasubrahmanyan
’08 has overseen multiple changes in the com-
mittee. For instance, each weekend, “usually
we have one blockbuster, one classic or indie,
and a foreign film," he said.“1“llms hasn’t ale
ways had this diversity.”

The committee is also larger than it has
been in previous years. The Films committee
is being expanded thanks to the application
process being thrown out the window. Now
anyone can join.

Not only has the size of the committee
increased, but so has its presence on campus.
Last year, Films began to branch out into
campus activities,such as a poker tournament,
and had some success. “I really want to throw
more onrcampus events that are sponsored by

”Octal/0nd”, iii go to Harri; right
before the movre starts to make sure
that everything is in order, that [he
pra/etliarnsl is there, Bur / can’t do
Inalforeverymovie,”

Films,“ Balasuhrahmanyan explained. "The
poker tournament will be back, wejusr hosted
the Talking Heads dance party and there’s a
Simpsons trivia contest coming up this Saturn
day at 3:00 pm."

Also on the menu are a student viewing of
the latest Harry Potter movie, Harry Pal/er and
1/): Order- e/l/le P/Merlix, in Qlad on Dec. 1 as
well as a super smash Brothers video game
tournament on Dec. 7. “I'm excited for that
one,"Balasubrahmanyan said with ii smile.

P stcrin the campus on a weekly basis,
SGA Films may be the
best-advertised student
government committee.
Given the 45 or more
postcrs printed each week
for advertising, it’s nearly
impossible to my: know
what Harris Cinema will
have to offer on a given
weekend.

Despite its efforts,
however, Films still struggles to attract capac-
ity crowds. Some showings play to a practically
empty theater. “For a 7:30 showing on Friday
night, which is the most popular time, Id say
30 to so people is a good showing," said Balas
submlrmarryan. "For any other time, 30 is really
good."

One reason for small showings is com
poring events, likc Harris parties. “You know,
I could be at l-Iarris Cinema on Friday night
or I could be out with my friends," explained
Tommy Jamison ’09, a frequent moviegoer
who attends the less popular show times. “Unr
less it’s something really special, I'm not going
to go a

other students tend to agree with Jamison.

“I'm not sure if anything could be done to
make them [SGA films] more popular. Advct-
rising is well done and seen by all," said David
M. Montgomery ’10.“The major problem is
that there are so many other events on campus
during the weekend and many people prob
ably just don’t care enough."

Movie selection has plagued Films in the
past, though this year has seen a wider range
ofmovies on campus. “Over the summer, I or
mailed the people on the committee and asked
them to email back one blockbuster, one {or
ergn and one classic or independent film," ex-
plained Balasubrahmanyan. “Then I made the
semester's film schedule our of their sugges-
tions, trying to trike two from each list,"

The results have been successful "I really
like the selection so tar-,“Montgomery said.“1
haven‘t been to too many this year, but there
are a bunch I wanted
to go to and was not
able to Ratataur/Ic
stands out."

One lingering
Films problem con-
cerns projectionists.
Almost every student
who has attended a
campus film has at
least one story about a no-show projectionist.
“Last year during Rear, the projector stopped
during the middle, which was really annoyr
ing,” recalled Amy Livingston '09. “And this
year my friends and I went to see another
one—I don’t recall which—and they couldn’t get
it started, but it eventually got fixed."

Such seeming incompetence doesn’t just
drive students crazy Balasubfahmanyan also
seethes over such easily avoidable errors. “Oc-

”You know, I (nu/d be in Harris (in-
erria on Friday night or i (nu/d be out
with my friends. Unless it’s somelhrng
really special (in not going in go,”
Tommylamison ’09

casionally, I'll go in to Harris right before the
movie starts to make sure that everything is in
order, that the projectionist is there," be ex-
plained. “But I can’t do that for every movie,
I’m only one person and I have other things
going on too."

One way to manage the famous no-show
projectionist is to have a VHS backup avail-
able, although the inost common method is to
frantically seek out another. “Sometimes I'll
ﬁnd mysclr running around just trying to ﬁnd
someone [to do the job]," Balasubrahrnanyan
said. Bur with only 1 1 trained projectionists on
campus, it can be pretty tricky

The costs of putting on a movie. ptojet
tionist included, are fairly surprising. A movie
at Harris Cinema runs the school between
$250 and 51,000.Thus, despite an annual bud-
get of 827,000, Films has to make its selections
wisely “35mm is what the
bigger frlms come on, and
the rights to them usually
go for 8750 to S900,”Bala-
subrahmanyan explained.
"Even older films cost us
$450, Foreign is always
the cheapest and even that
costs around $250. Add
$50 shipping for the film
and it adds up."

Cost is especially relevant as this week
end approaches, with Tim SimpxanlMac/ic and
Traili/iirirrerr, two of the semester's biggest
films, showing at Harris. The rights to Tire
Sirrrpwrrl cost about $900 while Trmirﬂr'mm
cost closer to $750. Balasubrahmanymn pres
dicts that it will be worth the price tag, though.
“In terms of pure, geeky excitement, I think
this weekend will be pretty good."
