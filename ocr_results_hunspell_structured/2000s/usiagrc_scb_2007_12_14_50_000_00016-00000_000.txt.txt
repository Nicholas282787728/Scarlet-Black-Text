Tim: I'm so glad the semester is winding
down,

Mike: Me too, I’ll finally get a choncc to
relax after my challenging academic schedule.

Tim: Oh, I was
talking about get-
ting lots of presents
for no particular
reason.

Wyatt: You
know what’s amazv
ing? I've never giv-
en a single person a
Christmas present in my life, yet every year I

- get a bunch ofthcm. It’s like magic!

Tim: You know what’s better than magic?
Luxurious possessions! This year I've seen lots
of commercials for diamonds and cars. I like
to watch them and think ofall the people who
can't afford presents like that. Then I laugh. 1
hope I get a Porsche this year. Or a yacht.

Wyatt: The presents are great, but I do
get kind otpisscd off at all the people dressed
in red outside WalrMatt who ring bells cone
stantly. It really gets on my nerves. I’ve beaten
rrp three ofthern so tar this year just to make
the noise stops

Mike: Those people are collecting money

for charity! I hope you didn't actually hurt
them,

Tim: Mike, we all know that charity
doesn't work. If we give poor people charity,
they’ll just start to expect it, and then they’ll
never get a job and society will have to support

them forever,

Mike: You two
have been watch-
ing too much Planet Earth on the Discovery
Channel.

Tim: Also, it you touch a poor person's
baby, the Another won’t take it back It's best
for everyone to just leave them alone, some-
times they even have rabies from poor dental
hygiene.

Mike: Well, the two ofyou can do what-
ever you want. I’m going to volunteer over
bleak.

Wyatt: Please, tor rhe love ofGod, tell me
you won’t be ringing a bell.

Mike: No. but I’m going to Volunteer on a
presidential campi .I’m even going to (Ilill’
cus in January.

Tim: Caucus? I don’t quite know what that
is, but it sounds dumb.

Mike; Caucusing isn’t dumb it’s a valuable
partof the political process.Anyone’s {voice can
be heard, and because we Live in Iowa, we have
even more say in the outcome of the election.

Wyatt: Mike, that is handStdown the
dumbest thing you’ve said this semester.

Tim: Everyone knows that voting doesn’t
do anyone any good. Never has, never will.

Mike: Well, the school seems to think it is
important. They are going to provide housing
for people to participate in the caucuses over
break,

Tim: Is that why I've seen so many damned
posters up around campus?

Wyatt: I tore a hunch of
those down, Ron Paul was
pissing me off. 1 mean, who
has a first name for a last
nami:> What an idiot.

Tim: Who’s Ron Paul?

Mike: Oh my God. You
are so horribly uninformed.
You have the right to vote
jiisr handed to you and you squander it. Do
you know how many people around the world
would love to be able to vote? And you don’t
even know the candidates for president!

Tim: Who’s Ron Paul?

Wyatt: Ron Paul was
pissing me oﬂf imean, who
has a first name for a last
name? Whaian idiot.

Mike: I'm not going to tell you because
you won’t even listen anyway.

Wyatt: Who's Ron Paul, Mike?

Tim You don’t know either, do you.>

Mik do too! He's running for president,
and he‘s, u

Tim: W'hete’s he from,Mike?

Wyatt: Is he a Republican or Democrat,
Mike?

Mike: Stop asking me questionsl Tm in:
formed and concerned, and you two are uncrltt
ing assholes!

Tim: Sounds to me like you're being a
hypocrite. Mike,

Wyatt: This whole time you've been acting
like you’re so politically correct and concerned,
and you think that makes
you cool. But it sounds like
we know just about as much
as you do.

Tim: Do you want a
gold star’

Wyatt: Maybe a cookie.>

Mike: Do you two want
a punch in the mguth?

Tim: Oh, violence The last defense of an
idiot who is wrong!

Mike: My participation in the political
process can change the world!

Quit swilliug the haterude

Firstly, what’s up with hating on sttbaftee
housing and the kids who live there? The pet)-

le who live in sub-free are not uptight, are not
forced to live there, and we can have fun. Grinnr-ll

is full ofall es of diversity and shouldn‘t sub-
free be included in this?

Secondly, there were lots ofrude people at the
Clinton rally. We understand that you were waitr
ing in line and wanted to sit where you wanted,
but it wasn’t our fault that we were told to direct
you to certain scatth really/wasn’t in our control.
but you were hostile to us anyway.

Liberal arts seem useless

Ok, so I know this all might be made easier
by purchasing a water bottle/trendy Nalgene, but
bear with me.What‘s up with the writer fountains
in ARI-I? How come the water pressure is best on
the thired ﬂoor? I know I'm not a physics major,
but I have played u lot or Super Mario Bros, and
thatjust doesn’t make any sense. And what’s up
with all the corrosion or whatever on the metal?
Could a chemistry person please explain that? I
don't think weird green stuff should be cliillin'
near the cool, refreshing HZ!) that I imbibe dur-
ing my precious out-ot-class time. Really now,
when was the last time they cleaned the water
fountains, like, 1975.:

It seems like the moral of the story is that, not
only am i dehydrated, but I'm also in the wrong
major. Dang, yor

Or she’ll self-govern you

This fall, STIFund Committee kindly bought
eight stipettsizcd red heanbag chairs tor the Inc.
Two months later, they have all disappeared. Rumor
has it that the chairs currently reside in locations
ranging from sex lounges to oft-campus houses.
Thats cool—Tin glad you're enjoying them—hut
as the semester draws to a dose, we really need
them back. If you pilfcring types could please put
the bcznbng chairs back in the ﬁreplace lounge,l
would really appreciate it. It'you are too ashamed to
own upto your delinquent behavior, or ityou'rey'ust
lazy, you can also post their location on Secrets and
I’ll come pick them up.

Thanks. guys.
