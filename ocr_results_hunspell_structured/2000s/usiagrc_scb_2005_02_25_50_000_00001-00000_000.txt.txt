Despite the pro—
tests, on Saturday
morningthctrustc s
approved next vear s
budget, including
the 6.5 percent ru-
ition increase.

SGA Vice
President Rebecea
Miller, who attended the meeting, said
that the trustees also passed a resolu-
tion to “develop a policy whereby smr
dents coming in will know how tuition
is going to fall each year." Essentially,
as students enter Grinnell, they will be
informed ofmaxinium tuition increases
for the next four years.

“The students’ message was heard,”
said trustee Randall Morgan, Jr. ‘65. “It
lccl to a great deal ofdiscussion,”

On Saturday morning, several
trustees talked about what would be
needed to cut the tuition increase back
to 55 percent. a $220,000 cut,Ttustce
chair Nordahl Bruh ‘67 was “trying to
keep things on task," but many trustees
wanted more time to discuss a redire-
tion. said Miller: A motion was made
to approve the full budgct, and it was
passed.

After the meeting, a trustee told
Millet that he wanted to make a mo-
tion to cut the size of the tuition inn
crease, but didn't think he had enough
support. According to Miller, he said
“I didn’t think I would have enough
support for it to pass, but now that I'm
talking to people afterwards, I think we
would have.”

Muffled chants from protesters
echoed through the meetirig’s closed
windows, as trustees asked some of
the students for their opinions. Cassie

an economically diverse student body .

The next day, Morgan and other
trustees are lunch in (Load. “We had
a great deal of discussion about othei
ways to make things more predict-
able for students,"hc said. “Sonic ofthc
things we’re looking at include raising
[donations] for scholarships and pro—
fessor’s chairs."

Other trustees compared Griiiiicll's
tuition and financial aid policies to peer
institutions. “The trustees, several years
ago, adopted a policy or trying to be
more or less at 90 percent orwhat our

comparable schools charge,” said Bi'uh t

evening before the protesn “Gtinnell is

While some trustees hare expressed

the opinion that Griunclls tui '

not high enough to appear piest ious,
some students argued that Giinnell is
already too expensive. When trustee
Bob Barr 57 asked students in the Old
Glove Factory meeting how much their
Grinnell education was worth to them,
Cid Starrditer 07 said, I’d pay every—
thing l'vc got,but iti can't pay lbr it, it's
not worth anything."

Others are concerned that as tuition
rises, poorer students will be unable to
afford Grinnell,“Ir's important that the
trustees understand the implications of
higher tuition," said Rachel Abbot ‘05.
“It's less economic diversity”

Protesters against the tuition inn
crease often cited the college’s $1.3
billion endowment, the third largest in
the country, and wondered why dcpen-
denee on the endowment is decreas-
ing.

“Ifwe're going to maintain Griniiell
for the generations to come,we have to
be financially responsible." said Bruh,
“We’re already much more dependent
on the endowment for running the
place... than any other school in the
country,”

Miller said the new policy otlctting
students know about upcoming tuition
increases was important, but that the
experience was still frustrating.

“Walking ﬁght from there and
knowing they’re going to raise tuition
was really awful," said Miller. “It was
really emotional and difficult because
the students were amazing. we were
reallv amazed by the numbcr orpeoplc
who came out to the protest, and a lot
of trustees said they were ieully affected
by the students."

chants

Protesters displayed
signs, tossed garbage
bags marked with dollar
signs into the air and
chanted. Here are some
that could be heard at
Friday’s protest:

making me so poor?"

I “Hey hey! Ho ho!
Tuition increase got
to go.”

' "We want (lustee

- "How many times
