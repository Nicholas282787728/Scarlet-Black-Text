viiu know how when cleaning out your closet you some
times encounter an object that you can't bring yourself to
get rid of betause it's so brightly colored and amusing, yet
you don't really know what to do with it beoause it serves
no clear purpose, and it would look out of place just sitting

in your living room, so you putit back in the closet, hoping
that next time you run across it you'll be able to think of a

' use for it? That's how I feel about my life.

~Jllll'l7 Tabbul ’02?

When I arrived on campus over three years ago I was a
non-hugger. Sure, it I wasn’t going to see someone for a
month or so a good-bye hug was warranted, but casual hug-
ging was out of the question. My least hydrite saying was:
”Do you need a hug?” And now, a senior, I admit it: I have
become a hugger. Someone] haven’t seen in two days gets
a hug. If a friend is upset over some trivial aspect of their
life, they warrant a hug. Someone who’sjust the right size
to ﬁt under my arm gets a hug every time I see her. My
hardened exterior has begun to crumble, What has Grinnell
done to me?

Emily Resseger ’02

Why is Grinnell so (onterned with being exactly like
its “peer institutions?" If I wanted to go Swarthmnre,
you wouldn‘t be reading this right now and I would be
having a grand old time AT SWARTHMORE.

We‘re him because l‘or whatever reason, Grinnell had
something each one or us was looking for (well most or
us anyway). So, it really irritates me when I hear of all
these programs Grinnell is going to implement so we can
be more like Carleton or whomeven One Beloit, Amherst,
Macalestei, (you can insert VDUR FAVORITE peer institu-
tion here) isn‘t enough, no way, there has to be another
one right here in Grinnell, Iowa, A little individuality
