No more smoking in Cleveland

BVBRMN SIIERWIN

1n Clcvcland loungc, rhc omnipresent clouds of smoke
and clusters ofcrgarottc butts have vanished,

In an April 5 c-lnail to Jainaland RLC Brenda Hunt and
Dean of Students Travis Grccnc wrote that Cleveland Hall
has been relatively sniokc-fi'cc sincc Grinncll College Sccu-
ilty and the Grlnncll Police Department visited on Monday,
March 30. As a result, security has scaled back its presence
iii Cleveland hall, according to the c~mall.

Cleveland was the sole dorm with r smoking lounge last
year, a situation thar was ended by rhc Iowa Clean Air Acr.

Director of Security Stephen Briscoe
confirmed dccrcascd security prosonca.
"we’re just doing normal rounds now,"
Briscoo said. “Vi/etc not doing the spacial
rounds to check that area [Cleveland]

At a Jamaland hall council mooring, In
residents cited a lack of communication
borwccn the student body, security and
Student Affairs as a source ofsomc ofthc
problems

“As SAs, we felt we could have settled
the issue from our level, using ssltrgov."
Cleveland third SA Kelly Musselman
wrote in an small to the 583, “So basically we just asked
that this never happen again rhat SAs got consulted so we
can do something about it on a student level r”

According to Hunt, the residents claimed to be unaware
ofsomo ofthe offccts ofsmokmg.

“People kncw they couldn't smoke in rhc building but
they didn't know it was harming people and that‘s what they
cared about most, at least that's what was told to me by the
students,” Hunt said.

By the time ofthc hall meeting, only four days after rhc
police investigation, the smoking appeared to have ceased in
Clcvcland lounge.

“We told Brenda at th: hall meeting that the smoking
and property damage m Cleveland first lounge had stopped
and therefore security should stop coming around,"Musscr
man wrotcr"Shc noticed hcrsclfthat thc lounge was in obvi-
ously better condition than before, passed her knowledge on
to Travis and Steven Eriscoc."

is to the state doesn’t tome

Brrscos expressed satisfaction with the residents'rssponse
ro rhc problems with smoking. “What in really happy with
is that the residents seem to be taking responsibility,” Bris—
coe said

According to Greene, the smoking cicatcd an unsafe
working cnvironnncnt for custodial staff. "VVltat happened is
there is a [custodial] staff mcmbcl who needcd to be able to
do his job and couldn’t do it becausc of all ofthc smoke and
the health issues," Glccnc said.

“I'm glad the issue is resolved and lflt doesn’t continue.
then there won’t be any need for further conversations about

how are we [going to] deal nuth smoking in
the lounge,"circcnc said.

On March 30, after a call from Briscoe
about a cigarette-sized burn in the Cleveland
lounge rug. Grinnell Police Depaitment Ofs
ficers Miltc Dickenson and David Mcnninga
investigated the lounge and found a bag of

Grinnell Police Department Captain
Theresa Petersen discussed the police report
in a phone interview With the 5:173.

“It says the kids were smoking in lounge
and burning the ﬂoors and leaving the cigar
rettes lying on the ﬂoors," Peterson said. “1 guess you could
consider that arson."

Petersen also cited a lack orcoopcrurion from Cleveland
Hall residents in the investigation to ﬁnd the owner of the
marijuana

“It says that everybody there was uncooperarive," Peters—
en said. “They wouldn’t talk to them [the police], they would
give them wrong names, that kind ofstuff."

The investigation into the owner ofrhe bag ofmarijuana
is still ongoing, according to Pctcrscn.

Although smoking in the Cleveland Hall has diminr
ished, Briscoe said that security would continue to be aware
ororhcr smoking issues on campus

“Now across the campus,we’re making contact with peov
ple who are smoking in areas that are unauthorized,"Bris-coe
said. “And rhe reason why we’re doing that is so rhe state
doesn't come in."
