Lincoln National Forest may be
best known as the home of Smokey
the Bear, but during Spring Break, it
was also home to ten earnest Grinncll
srudcnts. Joc Hansen ‘05 and Darryl
Ncufeld ‘05 led :in Alternative Break
trip to Lincoln, located approximate-
ly 100 miles to the west of Roswell,
N.M.

The rwwweek trip began with a
week building a "Trick Tank," which
is designed to catch

about what land belongs ro the forest
and what belongs to tlie.ianchers." In
the second week, the group built fences
to keep cattle away from the Ti-ickTank
and other areas important for wildlife
Despite hard work under the sun
and shivers under the stais, it was a fun:
ﬁlled week. Peihaps foremost, accord-
ing to I-lansen, was the satisfaction of
making a ditrerencc.Whi1c the trip cost
$1000 rot food and gas, it saved the park
service over 510,000 in labor costs.

As inspiring as the experience helps

two days ofa two week trip to San An-

trip, the group gnrdencd for the elderly
as part of an offshoot program run by
“St. PJ’s,” or St. Peter’s/St. Joseph's, a
group that takes care of children who
have been taken from their homes by lo-

“It was really cold," said Hansen.
“We slept ﬁve people to a four-person
tent just to keep warm." The group
cooked on gas sroves,but they still built
a campfire every night for the heat it
provided.

Despite the near-freezing tem-
peratures, the Alt Breakers ﬁnished
the Trick Tank in the first week, then
moved on to a second, equally impor-
tant task: fencing.

“There are a lot of prohieins in nae

Hansen, “and a big legal battle [exists]
