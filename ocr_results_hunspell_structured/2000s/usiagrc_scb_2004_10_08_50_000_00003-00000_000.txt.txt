Where can you park on campus?

Bv BRAD BISHOP

AND KATY ALEXANDER

so far rhis year, security has issued 303
srudent parking permirs. Cur-rendy, however,
existing lors only provide 223 parking spors.
Eighty-six additional spaces are reserved tor
faculty, student or craft cars. The Darby parks
inglot’s destruction and the Loose lot's change
from student to faculty/staffparking have con,
tributed to these deﬁcits and the consequent
student frustration.

Also this year, the fee for the student parks
ing permit fee went up from 525 to $50. Brlsr
coe feels strongly that “parking should pay for
itself.”With 303 permits currently registered
at a charge of 550 each, the college takes in
315,150 per year for maintenance otrhe park»
ing spaces.When this is broken down to cover
snow removal, student stafﬂ aesthetics (includ-
ing shrubbery), and other supplies, the amount
“doesn’t even begin to take care of the cost,"
asserts Btiscoe.

The campus Parking Committee has con
sidercd various measures to relieve the ﬁnan’
cial strain. Last spring, discussion centered on
the possibility that the cost of parking permits
mighr he raised to as high as 3100. Briscoe aSr
serrs rhat, “Fifty dollars is cheap - some col—

leges charge 520073300 and srill have wairing
lists (or people to get pcrmits."]—lc also added
that the increase in cost would likely decrease
the demand for student parking.

Some students, however, feel that the inn
crease in the cost of a parking ticket is unthSr
tiflable given the decrease in available parking
“Why raise the price ifyou just eliminated all
those parking spots? That’s not smart for an
institution as esteemed as Grinncll claims to
bc,"said Archie Tyson '05.

one or rhe major concerns ofsrudcnts at
Griunell is the lack of parking in close prox»
imiry of their residence halls. “We’ve got the
parking righr now, but nor next ro where peo-
ple want it to be." said Steve Briscoc, director
ofSecurity. “Some people come in here and rcll
me, ‘I don't care what it costs 7 I’d pay $200 if
I knew I’d have a spor righr ourside my dorm.
Your basie problem is that people don't wanr
trees to go away, even when we put in parking.
but people also want eloceein parking.”

The strain is not limited to the student
body. Associate Professor Samuel Rebelsky
relates that, “the college has tried to convrnce
faculty to walk but it doesn‘t work for somcr
one like me who has three young children who
may have emergencies." He also criticized the

college’s policy of only allowing each faculty
member a single pcrmit, saying “I rhink rhat
them saying you can only have one permir and
have to alrernarc ir between cars is srupid."He
also conveyed rhe faculty scnrimcnt rhar stu-
dents at a residential campus do not need to
have cars,

securiry Direeror Stephen Briscoe spoke
at length on the problems college campuses
race roday about parking.“l>arking is a prob
lem on any campus you go to. I’ve seen some
ofthc most reasonable people get upset when
it comes to parking,”hc related. ”I’ve sat in my
car for a halfrhour sometimes on some cam-
puses waiting for an open spot. [At Grinnell]
even I can’r rind parking on cenrral campus]
have ro park a ways away and walk."

Many campuses are trying different srrate-
gies to relieve this problem. Solutions include
regularing which students can bring vehicles,
building parking garages, and inrroducing
parking meters. Adding a semispermanent
parking lor off campus is another possible an
swer, geared toward students who rarely use
their earsAeeording to Jonathan Brand, vice
president of in 'tutional and budget plans
ning, the possibility of a parking garage on
or near to campus has been suggested in the

past. “This has been considered at least three
or four years," said Brand. “Some people don'r
like the looks of parking garitges."An under
ground parking garage has also been considr
cred, although the “cost would be through the
roof,"stated Brand.

The Security Department pays close attens
tion to the parking crunch on campus. Multir
plc times each week, student employees take
surveys of rhe campus lots, marking usage and
compiling the information to get an accurate
picture of the distribution of parking around
campus. Btiscoe added that, “within the last
couple weeks, we’ve added more spots on rhe
Cooper Street Lot [behind Quad] students
based on usage." Another more longrterm s07
lution to the parking dilemma posited by the
college is simply to convert more open space
on campus into parking.

Some feel that the college’s efforts to res
solve rhe conﬂict over parking would be aided
by greater dialogue among various groups on
campus. As Rebelsky puts it, “I don't know the
solution. I“ knew the solution, I’d be rich. Or
I’d have suggested it. It would be nice if we
had a more collaborative process tor coming
up with a solution."
