discover the meaning behind works of art

Knrln Nichus ‘88, curator of Education in the Faiilconcr Gallery, is
pair ora group rhar is raking and new approach ro an old problem; how
ro inrerprer arr. “lfyau look rogerher wiih orhcr people rhere are many
right answers. There is no Truth," Niehus said, “People with different
backgrounds and dinereni orporiences will see dilrerenr rhings."

When people look ar a piece orarr, rhey ofrcn rry ro doeipher ihe

Last Tuesday, the first Vl'S meeting in Grinncll
began as Alice Anderson ’04 showed the ﬁrst
painring and said, “Okny. what’s going on in rhis
picmrc?" At rnsi no one said anyrhing, bur rhen
diiferenr voices ehimed in, each commenring on s
diﬁereni tenure of the painring. When someone
told his or her thoughts, Anderson, the facilitator.
would paraphrase rhe sraremenr ror rhe group and
ask th: speaker ifthat was rhe eorrecr siarcmenr.
The group viewed and eommenred on iwo
painrings over a eourse orabour so minures. After

according ro rlie organizers. “I wanied in make ii our goal in bring VTS
to rhe elemcnrary schools and after-school pmgnms in Grinnell,”
Anderson said, “Some orrhe goals are no: arr appreeiaiion, bur verbal
skills and re cxtcndcdly look at somerhing and realize ehar you musr
have some evidenee io hack ii up. You are forced ro look again."

Srudenrs who arrended rhe meeriug appreciare bodi goals.

Louise Brigugiio '04, on an SEPC who errendod rhe meeiing, said.
“ii does seem like is would be really erreerive
with children." Brigugiio oame ro die meering

really wasn’t quire sure whar ii was abour. I liked
die fact rhar it was avery open diseuoion and
dies it wasn’t really led," said Eriguglio, "People
like io ralk; rhcy don'i like to be leeiured at."

Audrey Comeld '05, who came so she could
“increase my own undeisranding ofarr" also
found rher this former made an more accessible.
“I irked how it was based upon personal
inrerpreiacion and you didn’t have re know
anyihing going into it, which made ii more
accessible," she said, “ii was an eesy way to look
at arr." one rhing she mighr have changed abour

enjoyed ii and inrends ro become more involved.

Niehus is pleased wiih rhe reocrions of

and it's good for people who would like to look ar an more and feel
more comfortable going ro museums and being able to make sense ofit

Anderson hope to sen-sec all typ:s orpeopie and siressed rhe reer ihar arr

The two peiniings shown were Ruben Coleseorr's “Grandma and

The Decemberists

Earlimart
Saturday Nov. 1

A bit of ﬂavor from the 18005 is about to come to
Grinnell, and it actually has nothing to do with your
friendly neighborhood Society for Creative Anachronism,

The Decembrisis is a unique little number out of
Porﬂaand that seems like a piece of Pride and Prejudice
misplaced, Their name comes from a revolutionary
movement in Russia (loll! the 18005, and their lyrics are
mostly stories from a century past The very words they
use - 'petticoats," for example —are outdated.

Their songs are so consistently set in the past that the
occasional reference to modern times — traveling without
seatheli: on in “Heidi Dream I Was An Architetf' ﬁr a
bit of electric guitar slipped into “July July” — seems out
or place, like a jolt hack into the prasent. .

The liecenihrisrs are almost sleeve-phobic instead or‘ ,
electric guitar or synthesizer, they use the rich tones of
acoustic guitar, an accordion, snare drums, stand-up bass
and the stand-alone voice oflead singer Colin Mercy.

The wards to the peculiar tracks slip fromrthe simple
catchy fare of folk sungs to complicated and poetic
imagery. Occasionally their bizarre sense of humor will
crop up, still in the time period, such as their description
of the exploits of your mother (yes, your mom)1‘n “A
Cautionary Song." Their style is often compared to that in
Neutral Milk Hotel. So far theyve released two CDs:
cosinwnys and Cutauis 12003) and Her Majesty the »
DECEmhIiSLi (also 2003)

But just in case you wouldn't have noticed that you'd
just been sucked into a time warp, the opening band
Earlimart, a veryelectric, undeniably 20th century
punk(ish) hand from out in the California country, will
provide a strong contrast .

The hand originally bégan in 1996 with frontman Aaron
Espinoza, who has described the ﬁrst incarnation of the
group as the worst band in LA., and called their early
works “straight-up Pixies rip-offs" in an interview with
BBC. . i . * * ~i ,
Fortunately things have raken a positive turn since.
then, and a good chunk of melody and-rhythm crept into
their music with the album Everyone Down Here, though it
still sounds a smidge like has punk iiiinus the makeup.
ESpinoza sings about the daily grind of rural life and the
monotony of small towns, with emotions ranging from a
bored but upbeat frustration in "We Drink on the Job,’ to
a passive hopelessness in ”Dreaming of..." that wouldn't
seem too out of place driving through town farmland.
These lyrics take shape through a slightly synthesized
whispery voice that takes a back seat to electric guitar
rhythms and almost-melodies. The barely-there structure
makes a fuzzy driving texture that seems like something
goud to put on your Ell-player alarm clock, for that half
hour where you're not quite conscious but you need to
get going.

So on Saturday night at Bah’ , as you're recovering
from the ﬁrst week back from break with a cup of
whatever, you may want to consider a slight bit of time
travel to get you back on your feet.
