The Grinnell softball season came to an
end after losing their ﬁnal regular season

game to Monmouth Col-
leg e 7- 0 at home Tuesday
April 28. After winning
their ﬁrst two games in
the Midwest Conference
(MWC) Classic, the Pi-
oneers (9-22) lost their
last nine and will not
move on to the confer»
ence tournament.

"I feel as though all of
the teams in rhe [MWC]
this year were really
evenly marched," said
Brooke Yodei' ‘12. “You

had to come out every game and play."
After losing six seniors from last year's
8—20 squad, expectations at the beginning

”There were many reasons to
throwr'n our mins of the beg/hr

hing oflhe season. Although our
season ended earlier than we had
hoped, /’rn very proud ofwhat the

team attornp/rshed [his year”

at miiiot ways," Montgomery said.
wasn't really anyone who didn’t get to see a
lot of playing time or didn’t get to contribute

ofrhe year were modest for the young team.
“Having to go through a lot of the
things we had to go through this season

also made us closer," said
Kelsey Montgomery ’11.
“At some points it didn't
matter what level you were
«L It made us a team unit.
You' had to depend on the
people on your team.”

The Pioneers had only
12 players and only three
seniors on the roster but
still only just missed a
conference tournament
berth.

“Everyone was able to
contribute and participate
“There

in certain ways."

Assistant Coach Kate Gluckman was
also impressed with how the team handled
their situation.

“I'm very proud ofthis team. There were
many reasons to throw in our mitts at the
beginning of the season and the athletes
stayed focused, stayed strong, and believed
in themselves," Gluckman said. “Although
our season ended earlier than we had hoped.
I'm very pioud of what the team accomr
pltshetl this year."

Although the llOll’COﬂfﬁlei‘iCC schedule
yielded only three wins, they provided the
team with eaposure to tough opponents.
The experience eertainly paid off in the bee
ginning of eonferenee play as the team won
their first six and stood atop the South Divir
sion standings.

“The team did a great job this season.
They worked hard on a daily basis and found

success in the games,“ said Gluckman. “We
always focused on completing the routine
plays, having solid atrbats each inning.“

But after victories over Beloit College
and Lawrence University, Grinnell was unr
able to secure a win in the rest of the MWC
Tournament.

"That's hard because we went into cone
fetenee undefeated and had a huge target on
our back,"Yoder said. “That’s a hard thing to
play under when you only have 11 people."

Despite a sour end to the season, Monte
gornery said she felt that there has been a lot
ofprugress made this year.

“There’s just a world of difference be
tween how it was last year and the Ramada
tion we started off with this your," Mont-
gomcry said. “I thlnk that after bringing in
another ﬁrstrycar class, the next few years
we're really going to work otfwhar we start-
cd this season."
