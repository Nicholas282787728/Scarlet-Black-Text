The Single Sock and Other Adventures
Chapter II
by Sarah Boyer

 

The bar was dark except for several hooded
light bulbs hanging from the coding which
gave the entire windowless space i reeling rem»
iniscent ofa jail cell. James sighed and wiped
his hands on the stained white apron around
his mist.

He had been biutcnding atBadger's forﬁvc
years not because he had any love for this place
audits tables, chairs and pool tables always in
a state nearing complete and total decrepitude,
but because he had slipped into a dangerously
persistent state of apathy

Right now, he was standing behind the
counter in front of the shelves of liquor ’
glasses with a rag that he pretended had alimys
been this particular shade ofbrown.

The bar was not busy now, Clyde was his
only customer this early in the evening except
for two cosomethings playing pool in the
back and arguing rather loudly about whether
or not something A’s hand had interfered with

_/
the eight bull's natural path.

Clyde was the quintessential Badger-s clien-
tclo: large, usiiaily loud, and most often wearing
a T shirt too tight for his prominent beer gut
Now seeing Clyde in the bar was not an “n,
usual sight,a but this week Clyde had been sit-
ting alone brooding over his can of Budweiser
rather than with his group offriends.

His cloud of bad mood was so thick that
he had not even noticed when his current love
interest, Sally, the woman who ran the cash reg-
ister at the local gocerytwalked into the bar last
night.

“Another?"James asked.

“Yeah Iguess"

James readied into the refrigemror behind
the bar, pulled out another can of beer and
placed it on the bar in front of Clyde

“Ever notice," said Clyde, “how when shit
hits the fan it seems to get everywhere?”

Little explanation given for
Theatre prof’s departure

Questions surround Chris Connolly’s abrupt academic
leave after seven years of teaching and directing

iiv MATT ZMUDKA

Faculty changes are normal during the
summertime at Grinnell, and this year was
no exception. In a small department, however,
one change can have a deep impact, and for the
Theatre department, one professor's departure
was both sudden and sutprising.

Chris Connelly, Theatre, is on academic
leave for the 20074008 year, with no offlr
cial explanation released. Elizabeth Bonjeun
is teaching many of his former classes, and a
new technical theatre
professor has also been
added.

Joining the col-
lege in 2000, Connclly
taught classes such as
Fundamentals of Act—
ing and intermediate
Acting, He also directr
ed many productions
in the department, and
was scheduled to direct the inoinstagc prodUCr
rion of/I [WI/{Sumiﬂll' Nrgiil Dwain this yeat
(Sandy Moffit will direct the show instead),

Connelly was known for his often fiank
style ofdircctingmciust kind oflold it likc it
was, didn't try to sugarcout things, didn't let me
slack off," Katherine larvis '09 said. “I mean,
when you sucked, he was
going [0 tell you."

“I always apprecir
aterl that he challenged
me a lot and dcfinitcl
pushed me to go beyond
my limits," Renee Lynch
'08 said.

Jarvis had him as a
professor for three semesters and was pleased
With her experience. “I think it’s a shame that
future acting students won‘t get to expctlence
him as a professor," she said. “Because 1 think
he really was a great professor and really did a
lot of good things for a lot of his students, but
I havc complete conﬁdence in the department
to rind another great professor.”

No students seem clear as to the condir
tions under which Connolly left, although his
departure was not without tension. Connelly,

”The sad thing about if is that, sinte
there’s no information available, {here
area [or ofreri/ly Wild rumors ouiineie
. . it’s hard to know what to believe.”
Renee Lynch ‘08

”i think [funnel/y] really was a great

professor and really did a lot ofgiiod

things for a lot ofhis students.”
Katherine Jarvis ‘09

who was unavailable for interview, issued a
statement charging that his situation is a result
of irregularities in the faculty review process.
“It consumed huge amounts of time and en-
ergy that could have been spent in much more
productive ways to my family, my scholarship
and Grinnell College," Connelly said.

“The process in this case should not have
happened the way it did and should be of conr
cern to all faculty, especially junior faculty, and
students." Thosc familiar with the situation
cite a lack of published
material as a possible tear
son for his leave. “Even if
you're spending a lot of
time directing shows or
creating light designs, it’s
not necessarily seen as
scholarship or an academic
contribution," Lynch said.

Both Jarvis and Lynch
expressed frustration about
the lack of information regarding Conneily’s
leave, espectally for Theatre majors. “The sad
thing about it is that, since there’s no informa-
tion available, there are a lot of really wild ril-
mors out there," Lynch said,"lt's hard to know
what to believe."

“I kind of feel like as -.i Theatre major I
should know whats going
on in the department,”
Jarvis said.

Whatever the cause
of Conneliy's depar—
ture, change is inevitable
within the Theatre (16’
partmcnt. “Because the
Thcntrc department is
so small, I think any new personalities, lack
or gain, are gomg to change the department.”
Lynch said.

Despite this ﬂux in composition of the
Thcarrc department, Lynch remained upbeat,
appreciative for her experience with Connclly
regardless of the reasons for his departure. “1
am grateful to have been exposed to such a
variety of personalities in the Theatre depart
ment and I think that has deﬁnitely Sticngll‘r
cned me as a student and as an artist."

What does that [posi-
tion] mean?

It is a multifaceted job.
I work with faculty mem-
bers, with students and with
members of the community.
Part of the job involves ﬁnd’
ing ways to get people into
the gallery and to look at the
exhibits Another part is to
have programs that relate to
the exhibit. Part of it involves
working with faculty mcmr
bers to develop projects tied
to the exhibitions.

What types of projects?

For instance, right now I
am working on a project for
the Martin Luther King 40th
anniversary. we’re making
hundreds or luminary bags
that have words from the
speech that he gave, and im'
ages from that event 40 years
ago that will be part of the
celebration. I'm also work
‘ing on developing outreach
programs with students that
involve arts to use arts as a
way to connect the college to
the community, so reallyjusta
whole range of facets,

Was this position already
at the college or is it new this
year?

It’s a little bit of both,
Previously there had been a
curator that was only a half-
time position and her family
moved so the position was vur
cam for a year, and then after
that year it WAS decided that
the position should be a fullr
time position.

What do you think ofthe
college so far?

it’s a really remarkable in
stitution, I’m delighted with
the students; it’s rcally great to
be able [to work] with thcm.I
like the faculty tremendously.
There’s a scene ofprofessionr
rilism and enthusiasm. The
staff here tit the Faulconer is
really terrific and wondcrhil
to work with, so I'm delightr
ed An amazing thing that we
have here at Grinnell is the
ability to ring in artistsr In
September alone we will have
eight or nine v‘ ‘t‘ing artist
coming through. In my old
position at Central College 1
would have a budget for only
perhaps six Visiting artists all
year. And that was considered

it ieasonuble numbci to have
theie. so iciliy the resources
here and the ability to bring
in artists from all across the
world is a wonderful and
amazing thing.

Are there any plans on
the horizon?

One of the things I am
working on is setting up arts
outreach in the community
that involves students that
rotates to Mayﬂower homes
and different after—school
programs here in town. And
what I’m looking at is buildr
ing a bridge between the col-
lege and the community For
the College, this semester
focuses on artists from Mos
rocco, which will be part of
our art exhibition “Seven In-
ternational Artist with Roots
in Morocco," and so we are
planning different ways to
get those artists into different
classes rind across the cam-
pus.

We are also in the process
of planning a Ramadan feast
with help of the International
Student Relations and the
Chaplin’s oﬂ‘tce. That would
be a logical way to tie in the
opening ofthe Morocco galr
lery with the Muslim popur
l‘rlllon here rind also to build
understanding between the
Muslim students and the
nonrMuslim students.

Are there any other ways
you want to reach out with
the arts?

Often times people don’t

Til/y macaroni-r1

think about integrating art
into their curriculum or into
their classes, but art is always
about something. And cer-
tainly it is the formal values of
color, lines, form and texture
and also the technical things
how you use paint, how you
use metal, how you use clay
and so on.

But it‘s always about
something as well, whether if
that’s just the formal ideas or
the content. For instance one
of the pieces in the show here
is about a person from Moe
rocco who has this view of the
Black Panthers as an outsider
and what happens to a cultutr
a1 icon over a period oftimc.t
can look at that one and think
there are a lot of good times
[so] people can come and
look at that piece that has to
do With history, that has to do
with sociology, that has to do
with AfricanrAmetican stud
ies,

So really it’s getting peor
ple to understand that it's
art, but it also has to do with
many other subject matters.
Tnily not every piece is about
everything, but surely there
is a wide variety of ways that
you can engage in art and it
can really help you sometimes
with those subjects you have
been studying for a long time.
It’s another form of inquiry,
visually based rather than
numerically or based through
words.
