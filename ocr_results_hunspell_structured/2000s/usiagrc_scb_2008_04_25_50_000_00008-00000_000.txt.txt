Book addresses body image with words and photos

April 25 2008

Most Grinnclljans only see each other naked after
a night of dancing at Harris. But in Press's upcoming
book, Rio/l rial Dielr by Emma Lawler ’09, students
will get a more revealing look of their peers' bodies—
and what they think about them

Although Rina 1w! Dim has only been a Press
project this semester, Lawlcr has been thinking about
the project for a while, “The book has been in my
mind in a lot of different ways for over a year," said
Lawler. “I went on a really big bike protest in Helsinr
ki, and I just thought about what I wanted to do with
the book on the bike ride 1 saw this big graffiti that
said ‘riots not diets.”

Lawler thought this phrase,used in the fat accep-
tance movement, would be perfect for
her book on bodies and how we view
them.“It's supposed to be a much more
inrdepth conversation about how you
think about your body and other bod-
ies," said Lawler. “It’s about disassoci-
ating the way your body looks and the
way your body works and functions."

But while the book is Lawlct's
project, over 30 people contributed
articles, with Lawler organizing the
book as a whole, “It's Emma's book.
but she made it very clear that we
were all equally very important,” said
Joanna DeMars '10, who wrote a piece
on people with disabilities and body
images.

In addition to written pieces, each contributor had
their picture taken,generally in some state ofundrcss.
Lawler was rhe phorographer for each of the photo
sessions. “it was a big deal for a lot of people, and it
was a big deal for me.”said Lawler.

“Going in there you have no idea what to do, but
[Emma] just makes you feel comfortable,"said sierra

"It was kind of weird to be honest," said Mark
Wilcox '09, another contributor. “[Bnt] after the inn
tial sort of barrier was bleached, it was fine; it was
actually quite namral."To help make the process more
comfortable, each person was allowed to pick which
oftheit pictuics would be included in the book

While producing rhe material for the book seemed
to be a pleasant piocess for most involved, the book

went through a number of difficulties before it could
be published. Earlier in the semester, Lawlcr’s exter-
nal hard drive, which contained most of the material
for the book, was stolen fiom Cleveland lounge. “This
was Like so many hours ufmy life," said Lawlcr. "So I
sent out a very sad ctmail to all the RLCs and asked
them to forward them to their clusters,”

Most of the materials for the book were backed
up elsewhere, so the main concern was that someone
could spread the images the hard drive hold. “I could
see for some people that being a major point ofstress,"
said Wilcox. “But I figured some ofthosc images are
going into the book anyway, so if someone was going
to find thcm,i wasn't going to be too upset."The hard
drive was later returned by a student who claimed to
have found it in the loggia,

The book encountered ant
other setback when it was sent to
the printcrr “Finally everything
was basically finished, all the eds
its were done, all rhe layout was
done, all the really heavy work,
and the publisher decided not to
print it," said Lawler.

The publisher that Press has
worked with has a no-nudiry
policy, which they were initially
unaware of. “We'd talked about
the book and a little bit of what
was in it,"said Mac Poliiinka ’08,
one of the heads of Press. “But
we didn’t think was necessary to go over all the do
tails."

Luckily, Press was able to find a new publisher
in Minnesota who would print the book faster than
the previous publisher, not causing the book to be de-
layed, “I feel like the book has been pulling its own
weight toward sometliiiipir's been iiding a lot of
obstacles," said anlcr. Pohanka predicted that unless
there were furthci difﬁculties, the book will probably
be released next Friday.

The various contributors to the book are look
ing forward to see the ﬁnished product, since most of
them have not seen it collcctcd together. “I'm a little
bit nervous. but I think everyone is very, very chitctl
about it," said Strassbcrg. “I think it will be exciting
for us to soc it as one book as a whole,"

”lr’ssuppbscd to her] much more
ln—deplh (onyerruh‘on about
how you think about your body
and other bodies. It’s about db-
assotlahng the way your body
looks and the way your body
works and functions?”

YGB’s event-filled year includes CD, concerts

quaaicsAanorm

The Young, Gifted and Black gos-
pel choir celebrates its 40th anniversary
this year Even by its own high stans
dards, the choir has had an extremely
successful year,

Last Saturday, YGB performed at
Herrick Chapel to a packed, enthusir
astic audience. The concert Featured
some of original songs as well as a rap
(written by City) by Pat Green '085,
which showed the impressive range of
the choir that includes students ofall
backgrounds.

“I used to tap back in high school,"
said Green, who had not rapped since
and was surprised by the request. “Barry
introduced the idea to mev—hcjust said
‘You're going to rap on this song' . .. and
he put the whole thing together."

YGB, accompanied by a small band
ofmusicians, performs Christian gospel
that emphasizes dominant vocals-their
shows often involve audience participa-
tion, including clapping and dancing.

But the performance also highlight-

ed somc problems that the chon could
face in rhe future. In particular, reten-
tion rates may become a concern. “We
had a senior song, the last one in the
last concert for many of us," said Mattie
Brown '08, “Halfthc group stepped up!
We were like whoa, what are we going
to do next
year?”

believes that
the choir
could sure
wire with as

members,
though at
some point
it would
cease to be
a choir and

become a —

“group" instead. However, she doesn't
anticipate such a scenario.

Orchestra
Mattie Brown ’08 in an "n,

concert to
commemorate Martin Luther King’s
visit to the college in the fall of1964.
In the spring, it mottled its ﬁrst CD.
with original songs by Nate Clay '08

and Barry Jones, the choir dircctor.

Bairyloncs will continue to lead the
choir next fall and spring, but Brown
hopes that someone will also ﬁll the
informal leadership role she has in the
choir, “Every year there's always some-
one who works closely with Michael
Sims [the senior associate dean for stu»
dent life, who helps to bring cultural
programming to campus] to get things
going," she said. “We'll present it to the
whole group and then someone else
will take leadership in that aspect."

Perhaps the most difﬁcult roles to
fill will be YGB’s band, in which Clay
plays keyboard. “Thc only one left is
going to be the dru.nmer,"c1ay said.

Brown hinted that the musicians
might leave hard acts to follow. “We
were going around the room at our
senior event, where all rhe seniors say
what they want to do," she said. “And
the bassist [Maggie Johnson ‘03] says
‘I'm gonna be a rock star!’ so now
we’re looking for another rock star to
replace her."
