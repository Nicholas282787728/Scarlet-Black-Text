From SOA to Briscoe t-shirts, with some FM lovin’

Funding trouble for trip to SOA

“Social jusrit s one of the main selling
points in the literature that the College dis-
tributes to prospective students, So why would
the college threaten to take funding away from
the School of the Americas demonstration,
one or the most popular and important op»
portunitlcs that students have to enact such an
ideal in their own lives?

For the last ﬁve years, students have travr
eled down to Fort Benning, Georgia to show
their resistance to the existence of the School
of the Americas, one ofthe the most egregious
examples of the attempt by the us goverir
ment to enforce its sphere ofinrirrencc in Latin
America through violence. Last year, they had
no trouble securing funding for the trip

However, last week the group was his
formed by the administration that it would
be subject to funding cuts The group had no
advance warning, even after scheduling and
fundraising for the trip far before last week,
and the lack of transparency that secured to
characterize die decision~making also led to
confusion and distrust. The funding was everr
tually reinstated, but the damage to the talk
tionship between student groups and the ad-
ministration could be permanent if a problem
isn't acknowledged.

The main reason for the d on, the eco-
nomic downturn, seems incredibly misguid-
ed—there are plenty of other activities sup—
ported by the College on campus that are at
best tangential to the college’s core mission,
while this demonstration relates directly to
“social justice".

"the other excuses, including le con-
cerns, seem just as misguided If the College
cannot support any student— based trips that
may be political rhcy would arguably have
trouble supporting the majority of the trips
students choose to organize.

Overall. the chance to actually confront
oppression head on, and not merely talk or
write about it, is an opportunity the College
5 hould eagerly embrace The fact that it seems
they didnt may simply be a result of poor com—
munication. But' It could also he a sign that the

College doesnt have' its priorities straight.
Either way, the handling of this situation
can either be a catalyst for change or an un-
fortunate harbinger of change in the Iclation»
ship between the administration and student
groups. We hope it is the former, and hope that
this confusion can begin the dialogrc it seems
to desperately deserve.
Love for Facilities Management

Come Monday morning, lounges all across
campus have beeredten .

carpets, mvsterious stains,
and a latter ofttash covering
the ground. The ﬂoors are
usually catastrophic and the
bathrooms are often crusted
with vomit. Yet, come Blonr
day afternoon, the mess is all elennetl up be
cause of the hard work ofa very select group
ofpeopl

F s Management works around the
clock to give us a clean, livable environment.
They are here on campus working hours be-
fore we even wake up. At 2 a.m. they are in
the JRC, preparing our student center for the
upcoming day’s onslaught. At 10 am. they are
cleaning the mess you made on your ﬂoor, and
by 1 pm. they have replaced that broken screen
in your window.

They do this job year-round, and are here
even when snrdents are not. It is because of
these, people that we studenm have such an
enjoyable college experience. Many times, FM
goes the extra mile and clean up messes for
which they are not responsible, and don’t even
give ﬁnes to the halls in which they occur, it
is not FM‘s job to clean up after 'IrI’esponsIble
students, and yet they often do.

So this weekend, take a few minutes out
oiyour day and pick up that mess vou made.
But dont stop there every day take a few mine
utes to pick up whntevct mess you make and
strike up a conversation with your FM person,
because they have a lot of interesting things
to say.

Selftgov traded for Briscoe shirt
In the last two weeks, at least three mem-

"siaff Editorial '

bets of SGA Cabinet have received anonye
mous t shirts' in their rnailboxes.The t shirts.
according to administrators, are meant to ice
ward and encourage acts of self—governance, or
positive contributions to the community (see
article, p. 5) But while we love honoring (and
adoringiy chidc) one ofthc College’s most fr
mous members, we take issue with this.

First, sclfegovernancc should not be re-
ducible to a token trophy. it is a philosophy
that ineontrovrttibly is the governance of the
self, by the self, and FOR
the self. Perhaps the new
administrators of Student
Affairs have yet to learn
this. Students should, and
generally will, practice
self-governance because of
its own merits, not because Ufa small token
prize».

Sclfegm'ernancc {or a (shirt? Gtinncllians
are not mere llaI'lOtS to be bought.

But this constitutes administrative inter-
tererrce in strident life in more than one way.
Steve Briscoe jokes are it staple of student life
(http. //stephenbriscoesav edmylife. bloospot.
com) The quickest way to neuter the joke
of its comedic value is to have it co-opted by
the very pbwcrs it targets. As much as we love
Steve,he is, ultimately, part of the ruling estab—
1ishment,“the maxi" some might say.

Finally (at the risk ofcrying“poor food and
small portions"), the shirts themselves leave
something to be desired. The back of the shirt
is a caricature of thundersnow with a barely
visible portrait of Mr. Briscoe ﬂoau'ng in the
cloud. we appreciate the thundersnow refer-
ence, but this is only one of countless Steve
Briscoe yokes, and not necessarily his funniest
( uni-rand that rail, anyone>). Stephen Briscoe
is much more than thundersnow—he' rs un-
ending totnado warnings, air stagnation, and
kryptonitc locks.

Steve Briscoe cannot be reduced to an
item. He is not a commoditized slogan, he is -.r
mnntm, a way oflife.

And it is he that should be celebrated, cm»
blamned across shirts for the entire world to
see

How to get a job and pass your drug tests

Darcy Ward ’09 gives some alternatives to those people who think cold urine is their only option

if ﬁrsteyears are the naive whiny children
of Grinnell College. seniors

are the crotchety old fogies

who idcalizc the good old

days (Forum, anyone?) and

wish those kids would stop

running their months while

the grownups are having a

class discussion, goddammt. Us outdated, on
cool. gctzcrs are not cranky about our immh
ncnt demise, however Worse we’re graduating
soon We have to go get iobs, or something

This process Is terrifying enough on its
own, but sometimes employers get nusy and
want to know things like your past employ»
ment history, or In how many states you are
registered as a set offender They don't always
take your word about these things, and do little
searches through your past and call your refer-
ences or Google you or whatever.

Well, i draw the line at my biology being
picked over. Don't people trust one another
anymole? Selfegovelnanbe should be applied
everywhere. Here is how the drug tonvcr‘sae
tion would go;

Prospective employer; “do you ingest
enough illegal substances that you‘re not go
ing to be able to function>" Grinncll grad:
“No way, man. I write bettel drunk and high,"
Prospective employer: “Fins but if you break
something I‘m charging everyone who works
on your floor For it." End of discussion,

Unfortllnarclv the rest of the world Isn't
as adorrbly unconcerned with drug use as
Grinncll college. so, in protest i ﬁgured I’d

.. urnm . .help you learn about the science
behind thug testing.

First, there are a number of ways to be

blamed for substances

I you didn't even do. Drug

tests think that Nyquil,

Midol and Amoxicile

hn are way more fun

then they actually are.

ibuprofen used to cause

positive marijuana tests, but they did a swrt»

charoo in the rest and rook tlurt excuse away.

And obvs eating poppy seeds and hemp are
bad news, bro.

But, luckily for Cleveland, second hand
smoke won't get you up to detectable levels,
Unless, as was posited by a website lobbying
for legr .. tron ofpor,you are surck in a closer
with heavy smokers for several hours. Second
hand high my ass. How high do you have to be
to get stuck in a closet?

lfyoti'vc been clnlllnY with the closet gal
how much time you have to get clean depends
on how often you indulge Weed metabolites
build up in your body over time, so someone
who rarely smokes has detectable levels for
about a week, whereas potheads can test posis
[Ively seven weeks after taking up. And since It
is stored In fat, those with more of it will test
positive louver.

So In -ung that fur is your friend Ex
Cisc is u tlnivc y accepted my ordoing this.
Some people in chauooms swcaI raking lipid
metabolites like niacin (vitamin B3) will cause
your body to process the porrrufusttl far faster
Websites with everything rolled right say this
isn’t so. h’lol'cmcl', they c aim in l ge doses
niacin can send you to the emergency room
with cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, and a change

in blood pH.

Other failed tactics include giving the lab
old pee, or diluting it to the point where it is
clear.Addlng acid to urine causes the marijuana
metabolites to deteriorate, but pH ofless than
four looks ﬁshyThere are other chemicals that
cause the rest to come up negative (including
Visine drops) but they are easy to detect and a
pretty surefire way of not getting hired,

Unfortunately, so is failing a drug rest.
But by the time the big day rolls around there
isn't a whole lot that can be done, other than
drinking lots of ﬂuids and diuretics to ﬂush
out your system as much as possible and take
ing some Aspirin An iffy but legal way of gee
ting around the fact that labs wont accept clear
samples is taking vitamin BZ,\vhich turns your
pee more yellow

Eur urine is not the only bodily ﬂuid that
cm betray vou. Blood and spit are used to test
for current intoxication, and sweat detector
patches are used to test drug use over a period
of time. These are all tricky to fool, but don't
test usage weeks or months earlier.

Hair is the enemy here. Hair follicle tests
can reveal what you did on 10/10, especially
ifyou're bl k. Thick, dark hair is more likely
to rest post than fine lrglrtscolorcd strands.
And don't IhIIIk shrvrngyout head will get you
out of’rhisithcv can u pubes lust refnrc the
test on the grounds it i . r

Once ago ,it appear, innyhlondes have
all the lucl For ev yonc e, repeat after me.
“I was just chew g on some hemp, sir Nach-
os> No, no. rm not hungry." Congmmlauons,
seniors. You might get hired for tha job you
didn’t really want any way.
