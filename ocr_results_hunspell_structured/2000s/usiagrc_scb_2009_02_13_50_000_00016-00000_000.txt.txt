Spring vacation,
originally sched—
uled from March
28 to April 4, has
definitelybeencan—
celled, Dean Earl
Strong announced

‘ this week.

 

 

 

SWIMMING CONFERENCE: The most nearly naked people that you
can see for free. ThisVFriclay, Saturday and Sunday—be there.

 

 

 

BATHS: They are so relaxing, but we rarely enjoy them since none

.ol us really know how clean the tubs in the dorms are.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHAINS: We made our decision. Not only was this event poorly
organized, but the entire list of accepted Chains was left open in the
Norris computer lounge for all to see.
