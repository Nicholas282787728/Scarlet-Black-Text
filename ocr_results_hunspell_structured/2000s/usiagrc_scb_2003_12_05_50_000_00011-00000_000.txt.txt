Grinnell. They are the 79 riansrersrudenrs eurrenrly enrolled at Giinnell,
rhey blend into rha community, yet they hive their own unlque subcul-
riiie, Their perceptions orrhe enmpns are different from those ofoiher
students because rhey have a reference poinrwirh which to compare Grin-
ncll, for better or for Worse. These students have lived in different tlurmsr
eaten different dining hall food and attended school: with different class
sizes, elimsres and social atmospheres. They are regular students, bur their
adjustment to Grinnell is moie difficult than rhat ofﬁrst-ycars making rhe
transition from high school to college.

Difficulties associated with transferring

Adjusting to Grinnell academically can pose problems for transfer
srudenis.Though rhe administration is considerate abour accepting most
of their eredirs, rho rcjcctlon of rust a few riedirs can arriﬁeinlly lower a
student's class year. sann Eeksrur '05 explained how he faced this prob»
lem.

“58 out or about 64 of my credits trans»
ferred," he said. One needs 60 credirs to be classi.
fied as a innior, so lacksrnr was classified as a Sec»
andrscmester sophomore. l—lo was fortunate
enough to be treated as a junior with iegard to
housing, but he still had to go rhrongh rhe hassle
of applying re graduate early, in order to oarch up
wirh his class.

Another problem faced by rransfer stridenrs
is their inabiliry to visit prospective schools enre
rhey decide re transfer. There are no prospective
weekends for admirred transfer srridenrs, and most
srudenrs are too busy with their college
coursework to travel out re the middle ofloiva.
Some transfer students like Barino and Tarullo
had the opporruniry re visir the campus before transferring to Gimnell.
but others like Gennarelli weren'r so lucky. “rOneel I decided to transfer,"
said Gennarelli, ’t was difficult to select possible saliools [to rrnnsrer to].
There's no mechanism for colleges to advertise to transfer snrdenrs."

A third disadvantage ofrransfetring to Grinnell n that it limits study.
abroad options. Stutlyeabroad srudenrs are substannally under represented
in the transfer popularionr only a small percenrage of transfer students
study abroad compared re all Grinnell students. “You get screwed because
no one tells you rhar you need to rake l2 credits in eaeh division ro study
abroad," said Gennarelli. “Ancl by rhe rime you start cansldering the re—
guiremeno you need to fulfill, its too lore," students who transfer mid-
year have rlie added problem or trying ro adhere re rhe courso rcquircr
mcnts necessary forstudyralymad because ofthc limited number ofeiasscs
available re them.

Students who transfer into Gtinncll during the Fall scmmct Etc: the
problem ofbeing rhrown inro New student orientation. While rhis helps
dacrn adjust to mmpus life. it groups them with first—years, which Gennarelli
found frusrr—sring. “Flrstrycars have different mindsets [than rransfersi,"
she said. “They are way more excired about being or college for the first
rime than we arc."

Baeino also noted that tutorial encourages ﬁrsteycars to form strong
social bonds with each other rather than with transfers. Cathy Cedric-s ‘07
nored that bemuseshe parricipared in N80. she was unable to make friends
with orhersrudeno her own age. Her friends became the other first-years
who were also looking [0 make new friends during N50. Having luln-
drcds ofoiher new students witlt whom to bond helps Fall rransrers adjust
socially; those who come to Grinncll in rhe spring, however, aren’rso lucky.

their next day is consumed with rhe hassles ofregisrrarion and rhe follow
ing dsy daey srarr classes,

Registration is a nighrinare, according ro Baeino, because many of
the classes are already tilled up, since students who were on earnpns dur-
ing the ﬁrst semester have proregisrerod for classes. The administration
rries to improve this situation by purring transfers or rhe fionr ofrhc rangr
nation line. bur they don’t save spots to. transfer studeno on class lrsrs.
“[Grinncll] should have a moie extenslve transfer orienrariori [for rhe sec»
ond scmesier], like rheydo during rhe ﬁrst semester," he said. “I felt prerry
damn lost."

Faced wnh the above difficulties, many rransfer studeno have con.
sidered another move. “Many of my friends who are nansfer students
have at least rhoughr about rransrerririg out of
Grinncll," said Bacino, "if they haven't aerualiy
tried doing so," Tiansfer students rind it easier
ro consider leaving Grinncll because they are at
ready familiar wirh rhe uansfer piecess. As they've
already written rhe essays, rho application is easier
to fril our rhe second time around, They are less
inrimidared by the Prospect ofndiustmg to a new
social armosphere than erher students are since
they have already gone through the experience
ofhaving to make friends at a new school.

Due ro theirsmtusas rninsfersrrrdenis, how.
ever, rhey often feel trapped at Gtinnell, “I
rhonghr abour riansferring [out or Grinncll],"
said bacmo. “Bur l realized rhar ifI transferred
again. rhe iargesr time I will hive spent in one school wont even be rhe
majority orrny eollege career." Transfer students also feel obligated re sray
ar Grinnell because gradiinre schools look down on studenrs who have
transferred miilripia iirnes daring their college eircers.

Bureaucratic tape

Msny transfer students felt there was an implieir bond imong (llemv
selves. “i used to think transferring was a rare occurrence," said Bxclno,
despirc the fact that both orhis parents were also rranster studenrs. “But
now ir seems like rhc rulc rather than the exception. Almosr half ofmy
friends are rransfersrudenrs." Because ofrhis bond, transfers feel rhar Grin-
nell should try [0 matriculare a larger number of transfers.

Assisranr Dean ofAdmissions Misty Hnaeuia works with transfer
srudenrs. and says that Grinnell wanrs re enroll rransfer srudcnrs. “[They]
are important in the diversiry ofviewpoints that they bring to the college,"
she said. However, she acknowledged that Grinnell only accepts between
ran and twenty percent ofrhere appllmntsisubstmtlally less than its overall
acceptance are or about percent for srudenrs applying from high school.

Acceptance rates can vary widely studeno rransferring during rhe
spring semester have seen rates reach as high as 63 Pctcenl in 1999, though
rhe rare was only ll percent ren years earlier. “The number or transfer
students we ncmpt is associated with the number of available beds on
campus," said Huaeuia.

Grinnell marriculares many transfer srudenrs each year by offering
berrer ﬁnancial aid packages than other colleges and univetsltics. Gonnarelli
belicvcs that ﬁnancial aid is more ofzn issuc for transfer students than it is
for rim—years, because rransrer studenrs are shorrchanged by the aid pro—
cess. Admlssions does not considers transfer srudenrs' applications nnril
they have made decisions on all ﬁrsleyear applicants. Since rhcsc apple
