New policy limits smoking

EV CAT PIERRO

on Monday, Aug. in, Dean or student
Life Jen Krolin emailed all Grinnell College
students, informing them of the college’s new
smoking policy. The policy banned smoking
in all residence hall spaces except in student
rooms behind closed doors in previously des-
ignated smoking halls and in yetctocbercon»
structed smoking lounges.

The smoking lounges should be finished
by the beginning of the 2005-2006 academic
year. Next year, policy will ban smoking in stu-
dent rooms as well.

The policy change follows student outcry
to an allrcampus smoking ban proposed last
spring. To college administrators, the new P01,
icy is a result of this student input.

However, not all students agree. “A lot of
students feel like they‘re asking for our input,
and they get it, and they do what they want
anyway," says Megan Ford '06, student adviser
for Cleveland First and Pit and an outspoken
opponent orlast springs proposed allrcampus
smoking ban.

The large number of ntstyears requesting
nonrsmoklng housing was one factor contribc
uting to the new smoking policy Because of
the potential of parental review of first—year
housing surveys, there is also talk of a new on-
line questionnaire system.

According to Tom Crady, vice president for
student services, more important impetuscs for
the new policy were the numerous student and
parent complaints and the results of the ant
nual Health Survey. As was stated in the email
announcing the policy change, 60 percent of
students never smoke, and "these numbers are
inconsistent with available smoke-free house
m .’

gOne student who asked to remain names
less observes, “It’s not inconsistent with the
existence of smokrftee housing, only With the

the scarlet and black

quantity available."

But the health record does show that 37
percent ofsmokcis aic trying to quit. Accord-
ing to Mr. Ciady, research has provcn that
restrictive smoking policies niakc quitting
caster.

Does this decision undermine selregovcre
nance? Crady answers that it is a “health and
safety concern." In light of complaints about
the previous policy, Crady calls the previous
smoking policy“lndefensible."

But will it work? Ford observes that hall-
way smoking in Cleveland may in fact have
increased as the motives for not smoking have
shirtcd from being courteous to fellow stu-
dents to the desire to appease the administra-
tionThc lack of ash trays is making smoking
damage worse, and Ford said she expects havoc
next year when smoking students are spread
out into all dorms.

Mr. Crady says that it took a good two
years for the 1989 change in alcohol policy to
settle into effect. He expects the same here and
invites students to email him with concerns.

ITS requires registration

xv BRAD BISHOP

As the school year began. at least 1,030
Grinnell students brought their computers to
the Information Technology Services (ITS)
Helpdesk and stations in Main and Norris
Hall to have them registered and brought into
compliance with ITS policy

This fall, ITS changed its computing polie
cy from “open, until the RcsNet computer has
a provcn problem" to “closed, until the ResNet
computer is verified as cleaned, patched, set to
autocupdatc and wnh Trend Mimi installed,”
according to the Resnct wcbpage (available at
http://www.grinneiledu/its/resnctm),

The impetus for the ncw policy came from
a spat of major computer problems last year,
including seven major network outages. nearly
450 port shutdowns, and over 20 cases ofwast—

ed paper from infected printers.

So what did ITS do to student comput-
cis? According to Karen McRitchie, Green
Team Leader, and Bill Francis, ITS Director,
virus scanning was the top priority. In the five
days othw Student orientation, ITS caught
and deleted over 18,000 viruses from student
computers.

In addition, critical updates for various op
erating systems were installed to prevent holes
in security. ITS also installed a new applica—
tion, Trend Mimi virus protection, which runs
on every system on the campus network.

One of the most unpopular aspects of
computer registration was that ITS unine
stalled existing virus software. According to
Anna McNuity ’06, it was dismaying to have
ITS uninstall software that she had paid fon.

According to ITS, the main b
Trend' is that the college is able to a‘
cally update it onto all systems, keeping stu-
dents from having to worry about continually
updating their systems. Members of the User
consultant “Beanie Team" pulled up to 14-
hour days in order to complete the process.

User Consultant Trevor Sedberry Y07
thought the registration process went very well
overall. According to Sedberry, “The UCs and
people were patient and eooperative...this is
something that could have easily gotten ugly
but didn’t." He felt it was important to start
the year with a clean slate as far as the network
and viruses are concerned.

ITS also provided free candy for snidents
registering their computers: “1 don't know
who's idea was the candy, but 1 love that per-
son,” said Sedberry.

Not all students were happy with the new
registration process, however. McNulty said
that this new policy IS inconsistent with the
college's policy of selregovernancc because it
doesn't allow students to take responsibility
for their own systems, “The new ITS policy
doesn’t take into account that useis have dif-

tember 3,2

fcrent levels of expertise,"she said. “I felt that I
was rendered unable to use my propertyr that
I lost control over my system."

Future plans for ITS and ResNet include
a fully automated process under which users
would be able to take care ofall necessary up-
dates from their rooms. ITS would then enable
full access on the port for the user, eliminating
the hassle of this year’s computer registration
and preventing the spread of vimses and secur
rity problems over the whole network.

Construction resumes

BV DAVID MONTGOMERY

Construction on the new Joe Rosen—
ﬁeld campus Center was delayed for several
months as the project ran over a million dollars
over budget, bu he costs have been ‘_reined in‘
without progra cuts'

“We re very excited to get this going, said
Tom Crady. “We ve been working on this cen—
ter for 12 years now, and are glad to ﬁnally get
a hole in the ground.’

The budget problem began when contrac-
tor bids all came in signiﬁcantly over what had
been planned. "We had done guesstirnates,"
Crady said, “but had nothing more solid than
that.

Eliminating the excessive expenditures
wasn’t easy, but in the end, the school man-
aged to do it by only making material changes,
rather than cutting any of the center’s future
services.

One effect of the budget problem was that
construction was temporarily halted. Though
the groundbreaking ceremony oecured on
July 21. 2004, further work only resumed re-
eently, when the center was brought back
Within budget.

As such, Crady expects the Rosenﬁeld
Center to be completed in approximately
13.24 months. Crews right now are digging
downward, sinking caissons and preparing the
basement.
