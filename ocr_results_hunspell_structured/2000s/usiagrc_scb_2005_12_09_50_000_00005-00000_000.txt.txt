on Sunday, arms held ﬁrmly against their sides
and feet flying up and down to the heat ofﬁddles,
ﬂutes and drums blaring over the speakers of a
Bucksbaum dance studio, members of the Experi-
mental college rrish dance class began their hour
of Eire with a circle drill.

“Toe — heel — toel" called Molly Riley ’06, one
of the class‘s coordinators, as the dancers stepped
liver following her lead around and around in a
circle. '

Riley, who is half-irish, grew up in a close-knit
Irish community in St. Paul. Her parents used to
allow her to skip school every March 17 for the
“long and cold”St. Patrick’s Day parade, where she
first saw Irish dancers.

In her neighborhood, “Everyone knows .ev-
erything about everyone," she said, “and my mom
knows the entire world.” Irish dance was a central
part of that community, when “all the kids would
come to [dance] class, all the mothers would sit
and talk” ,

In the middle of Iowa, Riley missed her Irish
community and the music, culture and gossip that
came with it. With her Irish dance ExCo class,
there is now time every week when she can share
the traditional music and dance of her childhood.
“I felt there was a hole here," she said, referring to
the absence of an Irish ethnic community. “It feels
goodto go tcaplaceeveryweekwherel can do the
cultural thing. Going to that kind of community,
there's a certain hominess to it."

The groups other coordinator, Liz Mallot '06,
took her ﬁrst Irish dance class at the age of 12 and
loves the community formed through dance. “I get
to share an awesome type of dance with a great
group ofpeople,“ she said. “Also, the nearest dance
studio that offers Irish classes is in Dubuque, [so]
I get to practice the steps without driving for for

Mallott has a lot of technical knowledge to
share when it comes to complicated steps. “What
I reach is the lrish dancing you would see if you
went to a feis” (an Irish dance competition).

The class focuses on soft—shoe technique. Next
semester, Riley and Mallott would like to oifer
an additional intermediate section teaching some
hard»shoe dance.

Irish jigs and reels consist of a series of steps
that are repeated on each foot while holding the
upper body still and the arms down on the sides,
The dancers perform these in a line that moves
back and forth during the music,

In her room, Riley listens to traditional Irish
music that reminds her of her culture, community
and identity at home. While the small Grinnell
campus is similar to the “in-your-face”nosy neigh»
borhood of her hometown, it just isn‘t quite the
real McCoy.

sometimes, constructive criticism applies to more than just a
piece ofwork. For Simon Levin '90, such criticism incircd both a
career change and a new perspective on art. He is now a successﬂil
potter based in New York, because ofone straightforward friend.

“[In 1992] I had just asked a friend about a pet I had made, and
she said, ‘I think this is wcll-mndc, but I don’t think it’s artistic.m
Levin said. “I remember being very npser about rlic conversarion
and going for it very long drive. And I asked myself, ‘Do 1 want
to do art?’ It was the moment of dedicating my life to art through
pottery." -

The beginnings of his love for pottery and ceramics starred nr
Grinnell, where he took art classes. In his senior year, it ceramics
class taught by Jill Schrift particularly sparked his interest. “It was
a class I felt Like I was conﬁdent in,” Levin said. “But I didn’t leave
college rhinkingl would have a career in portcry."

Levin left college thinking about a career in education and spent
several years after graduation as a substitute teacher. Levin realized
reaching wasn‘t his calling and he was just “going with the ﬂow."

He conrinually rcturncd ro porrcry to relax and have fun and
sought out classes, materials and spaces where he could work. While
living in Georgia, Levm met a Catholic priest who had a pottery
whcel. “We made an agreement where I would give him throwing

- lessons in exchange for using the attic of the rectory for a studio,"

Levin said.

Levin worked on his pots and tried to improve his artistic ex-
pression and technical mastery. Levin admitted that for along time,
his pots lacked any integrity “I thought the goal of art was to be
innovative, and the pots I were making was for the sake of being
original."

After his friend told him that his shortfall lay in artistic ex»
pression, Levin began to seriously consider what art meant to him.
Levin quit his substitute teaching stints and dedicated himself to a
fullstime career as a studio artist, continuously working on discover-
ing his artistic style.

Levin said that Gnnneil’s emphasis on writing skills influenced
his artistic view. “A good pot should be like a well—written essay,"
Levin said. “It should communicate and rcitcra'te ideas. Grinnell
didn’t train me on how to be an artist, butI learned how to idens
tify and acquire skill sets. It “ms at Grinnell that I learned how to
think."

On creativity, passion, theatre and big breaks

BV ALISHA SAVILLE

Thanks to a chance audition her first year, Twila Thompson ’76
discovered her passron for theatre. "A friend wanted me to go [with
her] as moral support for onesact auditions,"Thompson said, “The
funny thing was, I got cast and she didn’t.”

That passion drives her professional life and propelled her into
her current position at the Actor’s lnsrinite in New York City, an
acting school that teaches communication, presentarion and creatin
ity skills. .

"In rhe acting world, it’s nor like you can wait for someone to
hand you a job,“said Thompson. “One of the mcsr valuable lessons
I learned at Grinnell was thatI had to be responsible for my own
education. I had a far easier time adjusting to the fact that I’m in
charge of my own career."

She did take charge. The year after graduation, she ecsfounded
a theatre company with two classmates (Barbara Tholfsen '76 and
Judy Hoffman '75),Thc company wrote, produced and performed
Sirenr, a play addressing Women’s rights, "We felt there was some»
thing important to say, so we asked ourselves: how can we say this?"
Thompson said. “This play gave us an outlet to express our own
Voices."

Afrer touring the country and visiting Grinnell twice, rhe com-
pany disbanded in 1982 for undisclosed reasons. Thompson then
rook a wairrcssing job atThe Village care, a jazz club in New York
City; worked with the Actors Information Project and waited for
her next break.

In 1984 Thompson discovered rhe Actor’s Institute. “I came to
the Actor’s Institute quite by accident. I was waitressing at The Vile
Inge Gate when my friend and mentor told me I should do the mas-
tery program at the Actor’s Insrimte,"Thompson said.

After two years of studying and volunteering at the Institute, the
director offered her ajob. His exact words are still fresh in Thomp—
son's memory: You're here all the time. Would you like to get paid
for it?’

Three years later, they asked her to become a partner at rhe Ins
stiture. When Thompson took over the Institute along with her co—
partners in 1987, the company was ﬁghting to establish itselt’iir the
acting community. “We went through several years of struggle, bors
rowing money in order to stay open, going through crisis after crisis.
We nearly lost our lease a number of limes,”Thompson said. “At the
low point, we felr we had to be realistic and address rhc possibility
of closing down."

Because they built their company around focus of creativity
rarher than a speciﬁc acting technique, the three partners soon came
to the realization that they either had to close down or extend their
inﬂuence beyond the acting community. “Not long after, things
started to turn around. In 1995,the business world started to knock
on our door,”Thompson said.

Even though Thompson is now running a successful acting
school in New York, her time or Grinnell still holds a special place
in her memory. “Grinnell led me to a whole series of interests and
challenged my views," said Thompson.

In a perfect world, a hobby leads to a job that leads to a pros

fession. For Garrett Shelton ’01, an outgrowth of a faded dream‘

became a much loved carccr.

When Shelton arrived at Grinnell, he'rcalizcd that his dream to
become a professional bassist wasn’t feasible. “I couldn’t keep time or
rhythm to save my life, andi still can’t," Shelton said.

His love for music continued to play a role in his life at Grinnell
through music groups. Beyond his class loads, Shelton was dccply
involved in the music scene on campus. He was a member of the
concerts committee and the co-founder of the FreeSound organizus
rion. Shelron also workcd for KDIC for over three years. He began
as the Jaza/World/Blucs Format Director and eventually worked his

way up to Music Director. Through his experiences with KDIC,
Shelton was able to land two internships over the summer that cc,
merited his future.

Two weeks after graduation from Grinnell, Shelton was in the
workforce as a radio program manager for Verve Records, In 2004,
he changed jobs, becoming the Marketing Director for Sunnyside
Records.

His formative years were spent at Grinnell and rhnt's where he
became inspired.

“I know it sounds sappy, but my most vivid memories are ones
would probably be insignificant ro everyone but me," he said. “Small
things like a walk down the train tracks where an idea popped into
my head."
