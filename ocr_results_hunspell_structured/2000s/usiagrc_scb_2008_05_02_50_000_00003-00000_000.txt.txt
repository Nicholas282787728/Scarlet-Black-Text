Student Life Sheree Andrews, staffadviser to the Pub Board. “In
my conversations with the person from the city, they were under
standing,"she said.“But [the city] wants a monthly report from
us. as related to people under 21 being allowed in the pub."
Employees of the pub, such as bartender Jocelyn Newhouse

'08, think that lack ofaxwireness of the quota is a main cause of

the low food sales. “I've talked to a few customers who were like,
‘If I had known there was a 50 percent food sales ordinance, I
would spend my money here,"' said Newhouse.

Beyond the concerns of sales ratios, the pub currently faces
debt issues. “We’re in a deﬁcit,” said Andrews, “The College
doesn't mm to run a deficit with the pub."

As ofWednesday, Lyle’s was running a deﬁcit “$13,335.69,
much of which was born in Starlrup costs, according to Combs,
Combs said that about half of the deﬁcit originated in starteup
fees, not including stocking food and beverages nor preeopening
wages.

An overarching issue affecting pub operations and contribut-
ing to the other problems is communication among the manag-

ers and Pub Board members. “We need to have better commu-
nication between rhe management staffand the pub committee,"
said Assistant Manager Drake Ballew ’09.

One instance of miscommunication occurred with the estabe
lishment of operation hours.To address sales issues mid~semester,
the pub staff decided to stay open seven days a week as opposed
to five. However, Pub Board members soon expressed its belief
that the hours should be reduced, but it took some time to for
managers to get word and when they did there was a reluctance
to change the hours, according to Ballew. "I guess they didn't
want us to be open seven days a week," said Ballew."We got word
of that sometime in March or early April. We as a management
staffkind of... put oﬁ‘[the hours change].”

In hopes to address issues of communication, the Pub Board
has cemented its plans for an institutionalized Board of Direc-
tors to oversee the ﬁnances and management of Lyle's. “We'll
basically be responsible for the ﬁnancial aspects of the Pub, to
make sure it does meet the 50-50 city ordinance,” said Andrews.

The Pub Board formed after the SGA Pub Committee dis-

Pub board takes on a more defined role in management

solved, according to Sinick. “It was over the course of a couple
weeks as we secured members during the first weeks of the pub
being open," he said.

But the duties of the Board were not clearly deﬁned. The
institutionalization of the Board is one attempt to bring a better
sense of organization and purpose to the relationship of the pub
management and board, and will actively watch over budgets and
management, According to the by-laws that institutionalized the
Board of Directors on April 28, the Board will, among other du-
tics, “work with the pub manager and sraffro nchieve positive
ﬁnancial results (breakeeven or better) and ﬁnancial viability."

Meanwhile, Manager Conor McGee ’08 wants to focus on
what has been going well with the pub, crediting his employees
with putting on successful events, creating a good atmosphere,
and keeping the pub code-compliant. “I feel that right now we've
gorrcn a lot of goals for the semester in fairly good order," he said,
adding that the ratio and proﬁtability were longer-term goals.

Plans returns after five days with a new server

av DAVlD H. MONTGOMERY

Ian Lunderskov ’08 wanted to ﬁnd some brown shoes to
borrow for Waltz. Anna McNulty ’06 wanted to check up on
some of her friends scattered around the country. Ian Athana-
sakis ’09 wanted to get people’s feedback for a cool idea he had
for an art project.

All of them, along with hundreds of others, were thwarts
ed for ﬁve days by an overloaded hard drive in Hawaii which
crashed on Sunday night and brought down GrinnellPlans.
com (Plans). Plans is an onllne social network used by Grinnell
snidents, alumni and faculty for communication and procras-
tination,

The Plans outage ended late Thursday afternoon, when
Plans administrator Jonathan Wellons '04 moved Plans to a
new server in Texas donated by Athanasakis. Wellons used an
old backup to bring Plans back on line, meaning that Plans
posts since April 21 could not be recovered.

Before the outage, Plans was hosted on a private server in
Hawaii owned by Scchyi Laiu '04. Administrators controlled it
remotely and could usually fix Plans outages quickly by reboot»
ing the server. When it erashed on Sunday, however, Wellons's

attempts to restart the server failed, and he knew that some-
thing more serious than usual was wrong.

Wellons first started trying to set up his own server, but
then Athanasakis offered the use of his own web server, rents
ed from a professional company. After Lain visited his server
Wednesday and found that the problem was too severe to ﬁx
quickly, administrators decided to accept Athanasakls’s ofrer.
Athanasakis set up the new server and Wellons installed the
Plans software on Thursday

“[Athanasakis] just went into overdrive," O’Neil said. “He
got the whole thing set up for us. All we had to do was install
the software and get it conﬁgured.”

Athanasakis downplayed his donation. “I have the server
anyway," he said. “Adding Plans won't make it any more expen-
sive for the time being.”

One beneﬁt ofthe new server should be improved stability,
because a professional company manages the server. “1 rhink
it’s very likely that it [will] crash less,” Wellons said,

The current Plans reﬂects the backup that Wellons made
on April 21, Over the next week, Laiu will try to extract a more
recent backup from the crashed Hawaii server and send it to

the Plans administrators. Plans users will then, ifall works well,
be able to access the backup ﬁle for their particular Plan irthey
want.

Administrators were already working on preparing a new
server to host Plans. As the magnitude of the problem became
clear, they “put the pedal to the metal a little more to try to ﬁn-
ish it," said Plans administrator Eryn O'Neil ’07,

Athenasakis’s server could end up being a longeterm solu-
tion or a short-term stop-gap, depending on how it handles
the high demands ofrunning Plans.The increased storage and
bandwidtll usage could force him to upgrade to a more experts
sive server, or change to a different company.

The outage helped underscore how much Plans users fre-
quent the site. Wellons said that he experienced the outage as
"this empty space in my routine." McNulty agreed.

“1 just can’t believe how much I‘m on there, really,"shc said.
“That's been thrown into sharp relief over the last few days."

Athanasakls felt the same withdrawal pangs during the five
day outage. “I'm one of those people that read Plans every hour
or so," he said. “I realize how strong my addiction is, and that
[was] my prime motivator for Wanting to get Plans back up."
