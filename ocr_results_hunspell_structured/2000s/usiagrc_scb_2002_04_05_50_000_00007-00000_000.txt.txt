I am writing not as a member of the facultyil never taught
Greg in a classibut as an ofﬁcer of the Poweshiek County oerno.
(rats. Greg was one of the most eifective political organizers and
workers I have ever met. He was with the Poweshiek County Demo-
crats every semester he was in Grinnell. He started out knocking
doors in Brooklyn for State Senator Dennis Black—the lowest, but
yet essential, level one can throw oneselfinto. He spent a summeri n
Washington working on the shaft of Rep. Leonard aoswell. Both these
men esteemed Greg highly. How could one not? He combined civic
commitment, enormous energy, endless optimism and good
heartedness. I think that it was Greg's optimism that I'll remember
most: nowhere was it more manifest than his commitment to the
Nader campaign. One might have thought that Greg’s work for Nader
would have generated some ill will toward him among the county
Democrats. Not so, for he was so wellrknown and so well—liked that
not even the hardest-nosed among us could deny that he was doing
what he thought right. We were glad to welcome him back, and we
shall miss a truly rare and memorable companion-in-arms.

Among my many memories of Greg Schrieber, there are a few
that stand out and have lately been replaylng themselves in my
mind. Staying up late after Mary a. James last year, talking about
pantyhose and make up, among other things, with Greg—looking
like a prom queen in his frilly purple dress with a bow in his hair. I
remember us sitting on my bed at 2:00 am, eating Perkins takeout
(an omelet’te, hashbrowns and a mufﬁn, of course). And most re—
:ently, the week before spring break, just before a Whoopin’ Cranes
SI basketball game, Greg challenged me to a quick game of one-on-
one. His federaway jump and hook-shots were too much for my de-
fense.

I most remember Greg's smile, freckles, enthusiasm, and pas-
sion. I will always think of him fondly. Te echo mucho de menos,
amigo min. on entuentres la paz.

I knew so much about Greg before I even met him. At Free the
Planet! meetings, parties, and get-togethers, his friends would remi-
nisce about all the crazy stuff Greg had done, both connected with
activism and in his personal life. It seemed like he was larger than

life and there was no way he could really be THAT energetic, that
charismatic, that animated. Then the second semester of my first
yearI met him and was amazed by him. His enthusiasm and passion
seemed never- ending. In all of my interactions with him, whether
personal or connected with Free the Phanetl was ﬁlled with an
infectious vivacity.

He was so important to so many people here and his presence
on this campus was and is so strong. Ill always remember Greg at his
best: Greg at a protest getting arrested and still chanting, Greg pas-
sionately planning lobby days, Greg making sure I got a $21 tab on
my let birthday at the Pub He will never leave my thoughts and
memory; he has been a me inspiration

—Sr1roh Weiss ‘04

When I remember Greg I see his blue eyes full of sparkle and
humor, hungry for life and for dinner, the glass never grew under his
feet I think of his commitment to the causes he he let dean, his grace
and ease with people from so many different walks of life. I remem-
ber a person imbued with an innate sense of kindness and decency.
His loss is still a shock wait for an emailsaying it IS allajoke.

— usie Hurbur, Pawahiek [aunty Democrar

Of all the people my age I have known over the years, Iwas

convinced that Greg would be the one person I‘d be most likely to
read about in a newspaper or magazine in the next 10—20 years.
I honestly don't know where Greg got all the energy he had I re-
member going to Greg and Joe’s [Mowers ’02} room sophomore year
and Greg would always be on the phone talking politirs or organiz-
ing people while sitting' In front of his laptop Writing emails or press
releases I never ﬁgured out when he did his homework (it he ever
did) He had a passion and wasn‘t going to lot school get In the way
of it.

He auo had an incredible charisma that made him so good at
organizing people. And this wasn‘t only for environmental activism.
When I found out that he would be living with Joe again’this semes-
ter, I knew that Red Light House would once again reclaim its title as
the party house The only thing that changed between last semester
and this semester was Greg, and the party scene indeased dramati-
rally this semester.

I saw him at MCNally's a few weeks before spring bred

"B.J,, you‘ve got to come over tonight," he said, "We‘re having a
party"
"Uh, Greg, it's a Tuesday night," 1 said. “I‘ve got work to do.“

"But we're having the ton of fun party tonight,“ he said.

He had kept track and, according to him, the keg that night
would put them over a ton of beer for the semester

I remember talking to Joe after the funelal. We were looking
around at all the people who came and Joe said, "It‘s pretty amazing.
I mean, Greg brought people together again."

Greg, you will be missed by so many people. Ijust feel that the
world has been cheated. I keep thinking of all the people you have
already had an impact on and allthe people you Would have impacted
in your [lie and all the change you have already affected and all the
change you won‘t be able to affect now and I just think that the
world is worse without you in it. I feelfortunate to have been able to
call myself a friend of yours.

~B.J. Bloom ’02

Last year, Greg asked me if he could join the SI basketball team
that I "coach." He had friends on the Whoopin’ Cranes, and I knew
that he was tall, and those two qualifications made him a bona fide
member. We’re a pretty easy going team, ml was surprised when Greg
ran out onto the court for ourfirst game. He was all legs and arms and
ﬂoppy brown hair and that big, big grin, but he was intense. I an
into Greg after our ﬁrst game and we talked about strategy for an
hour in the Forum. At ﬁrst, Iwas amused. Strategy? We were a little
green to be throwing around terms like ”strategy,” and, you know.
"offense.” But as I got to know Greg, I realized that the enthusiasm
and passion that he brought to our 51 team was not unique to the
situation. Greg approached everything like that. He was a unique,
crazy wonderful person, and I still cant believe that hes gone. The
Whoopin Cranes were a small, small part of Greg’s life, but for the
times that he was at our games, he gave himself up to being a whoopin
Crane. I admire Greg's spirit and dedication, and the way he
unapologetioally pursued his goals. My sympathies go out to all of his
Emily and friends, and to all those that never got to know him. Rest
in peace Gregi
