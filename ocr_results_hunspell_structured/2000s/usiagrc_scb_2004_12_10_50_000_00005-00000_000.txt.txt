Alexander, cont. from p. 3
dy keeping me up all night with the baby those first
few weeks, and the name of the candy bar to him said
it all. I was so ﬂartered at his thoughtfulness.”

one ofAlexandcr's most significant relarionships
was the one he had with Frey. "Thomas proposed to
Aven on Field Day in May last year and he brought
us all into the circle,"Nagel said. “We always get into
a circle to have a big talk after we've had some battles
and he [was] dressed up as a knight, and he proposed
to her right there, and she said yes. They were very
close to each other.They'd been together since a tour
pl: weeks into our freshman year."

The two were inseparable, according to many of

their friends, and time they were forced to spend
apart deeply affected Alexander. “He was always with
Avon,” Barquist said. “It was one word. It was ‘Thomr
asandAven‘,The one time when 1 saw them separated
a lot was the semester Avon was abroad, and Thomas
was really not happy about that.”

Kemple agreed and explained how difﬁcult it was
for a person as social and loving as Alexander ro fend
for himself for a semester. “Thomas was so lonely,”
Kempler said. “He was like a sick puppy. He never
wanted to go home because then he would be alone
in his enormous room, so he would always sleep on
our ﬂoor."

Alexander will always be remembered for the way

he lived his life: to the fullest. One can only begin to
understand the type of enthusiasm he had through
these stories.

According to his friend John Abramowitz ‘05,
“Thomas was one ofrhose guys that you never heard
a bad word about because there really wasn't one to
hear, He always believed in cracking jokes and having
a good time. He always had lors otenergy and passion
for whatever he did.ththcr it was taking that spear
ofhis and charging into the field or playing the Pr‘illr
rrrr Bride drinking game. When he did something he
did it full-hog, no piece-meal. “lf[you want] a full
list of character traits, well, that will take the whole
night,"
