Mix of styles and traditions representative of annual event’s celebration of multiculturalism

IIY REHECCA PARK

Harris is, among other things, a place to dance. And
on last Saturday's ISO cultural Evening, the dance pere
formances were among the highlights of this annual event
celebrating international cultures.

Cultural Evening has a long tradition at Grinnell as “an
opportunity for Grinnellians to show off their cultures,"
wrote Fai Tosuratana ’10, one of the event’s
co-organizers and an 150 member in an e
mail. Like the ISO Food Bazaar held every
fall, Cultural Evening connects both college
and town communities to cultures outside
of rural Iowa.

A fashion show featuring styles from
around the globe kicked offthe event; later
pettornranees included Chinese Opera, rnue
sic in various languages and dances ranging
from Cypriot Folk to HipeHop.

After the Fashion Show, African Dance
boosted the audience’s energy levels even
higher. Organized by Joana Ofor‘rAddo '08,
the performance included three different
songs and incorporated dance styles from
several African countries including Ghana,
Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

The dance climaxed wirh a freestyle performance from
each of the individual dancers during the third song, an
idea that Ofori—Addo, who is from Ghana, drew from her
own experiences.

most ofthe Ghanaian’dances that I’ve been involved
in, it's just that we are having run," she said, “So while you
are dancing, you want to pull your friend into it and just
shake and enjoy the dance, and you cheer after you do it.
So for the third part of the dance, the idea was to get the

dancers to cheer on whoever was in the center doing the
dance.”

But the audience's enthusiastic response put less prev
sure on the dancers to keep energy levels high.

“When 1 went on, the whole crowd just became very
loud and cheered, so that just put smiles on our faces and
just made it so much more exciting,” OforieAddo said. “It
just had the effect that we were looking
for, and that wasjust the best part of my
night."

Choreographing the dance was an
opportunity for OforieAddo to explore
her Ghanaian heritage, something she
has been doing since she ﬁrst arrived at
Grinnell, Practicing dance styles from
different Ghanaian cultures since the
first grade. she has applied her experie
ence to the ISO Cultural Eircning and
Senior Showcase since her rirsr year,
and this year started the Afriquc Dance
Troupe with iumy Adckcyc '08.

For her. the event rueanr sharing her
experience on a wider scale.“1\vasri'tjust
looking at African students," she said. "I
wanted to just get everyone involved,"

According to OforieAddo, the minutiae of organizing
the danceircserving space to practice, getting people to
commit and than show up to rehearsalsiwas difﬁcult, but
ultimately the challenge was worth it,

“Some people forgot things, and I sometimes forgot
stuffmyself, so 1 was kind ofscared going up rhere because
I wanted it to be perfect," she said, “And I think it went roe
ally well. We really enjoy it when people cheer ., so it was
so mueh fun to see that people were enjoying it,"
