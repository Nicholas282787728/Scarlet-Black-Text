Alex Brooks ’08 and Dan Neely ’09, the titular heads of
rhis year's Tirular Head (whar elseP), embody the spint of
the 32nd annual event, Brooks. displaying a
fondness for obscure minutiae, brandishes
years ofnewspaper clippings and history of
the festival. ﬂipping through to find exact
dates. Neely in rhe meanwhile, manages to
rurn a Grill chair mm a small yet seemingly
comfortable bed, promising rhar there will
be "greatness, excellence and perfection."

The event was not originally a ﬁlm fess
tiyal. “It originated as a Relays event, and
there would be skirs,"said Brooks. “They'd
throw beer at the people doing skits. and
whoever got the most drenched would
writ.

Titular Head, whose name is of unr
known origin, died for a few years in the
late 80s and early 90s, but has been gar

2002's “Racquetball Tuuak Tunak Tun" was menrioned
as a parrieular srandour. "Thar's whar I rhink people really
aspire ro six years larer, everyone still knows it," Brooks
said.

Campus celebrities are essential, such as in 2001 when
“True Grinnell" mimicked CoeasCola commercials with
President Russell K, Osgood, Russ Motta and a former RLC

shouring “Wazzup‘” at each other. Osgood
in parricular was mentioned as a filmmaker
favorite, “He’s a really good sport about it,"
Neely said.

This year, Brooks and Neely are also
helping budding ﬁlmmakers get off the
ground wirli editing assistance “If people
are haying problems, we wanr to help them,
to encourage rhem. lfwe can make it her-
ter, why not?" Neely said.

The ewo seeTitular Head as a refleerion
of the Grinnell communiry and a chance to
have lots offun.“1r's just kind efembracing
our quirky community," Neely said,

“Filmmakers can be prerry preren-
tieus as a group, so rhis makes fun of that,"
Brooks added.

or course, nor every film is qulte Oscar-caliber, bur the
rirular heads don't mind. “You see a lot of really bad movrcs,
but that‘s rhe narure orthe show,"said Brooks. "Thais what
makes u fun."

Neely summed up rlieTirular Head attitude “We’ll take
anything preferably somerhing sweet."
