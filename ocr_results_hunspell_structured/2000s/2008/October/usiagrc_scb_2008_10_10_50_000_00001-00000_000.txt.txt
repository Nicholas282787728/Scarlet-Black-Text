Campus environmentalism ranked low

BVJUSTIN EkchsoN

Rarely, ifever, would Grinnell be described
as average. However, that's exactly what lrape
pened when GreenReportCard.org published
its environmental sustainability review of the
college.

Grinrrell received a Br when two indeperr
dent evaluators analyzed 43 "green" indicators
based on public information and surveys, which
was comparable to the rrationewrde average of
a 0. Despite receiving top marks in Green
Buildings and Food 8; Recycling. the college's
overall grade was hurt by a c in Administrar
tion and an F in Shareholder Engagement.

A common theme of institutions receiving
an A in administration had been an endorses

Tom Friedman

A big name will headline Grinnell’s 2009
commencement ceremony. worldererrowned
journalist and author Thomas Friedman will
address this year’s seniors as they conclude
their undelgmduato careers.

Over the past 27 years, Friedman, a threes
time Pulitzer Prize winner, has served as chief
diplomatic, White House, rind international
economics correspondent for the New York
Timer, and has authored several bestrselling
books including his most recent, 77m Mill/i:
Fiar. currently, Frrodrnan pens a biweekly for
eign affairs column for the Times. In 2005 he
was named on the US var and Wei/ii Repair
list of“i\rtrerica's Best Leaders "

Friedman's invitation to speak was thc cul-
mination ofa selection process that he in last
October. Under the guidance of faculty and

merit of the Presidents Climate Commitment.
According to President Osgood, rhe commit-
ment is “a complete Charade," Osgood cited the
Commitment's lack ofguidchncs that require
longrternr sustainable solutionsTbe adminis-
tration said they believe that cndorsing a corri-
mitment that didn't require a long-term plan
was undesirable

Eric Nost '09, a resident of EcoHouse, felt
different about the Presidents Climate Corri-
mitment. The Comnritntcnt “show[s] other
institutions and parts of society that there is
a group of people who are addressing climate
change," Nost said, and he believed a decla-
ration of environmental sustainability enables
cooperation towards a common goal.

Although Grinncll received a C in Ad
ministration, the report's most glaring critique
came in Shareholder Engagement. Tire col-
lege received an F, due largely to Grinnell's ree
liance on hired managers to make investment
decisions without college input.

Davrd Clay, vice president and treasurer
orrlre college, said that “ifyou take a long
view, which our managers do, their investment
process and strateg s are very consistent with
runny of rhe issues that are combined to so
cially responsible investment.”

In accordance with responsible investing,

Friedman was marked as the top choice.

According to committee

“We wanted someone that everyone would

A look inside
SGA Cabinet

ISYJEFI‘ RADIERS’I‘RoNG

Even if it is hard to believe, the semester
is already halfway ovel. \Vhrle students may
feel like theyjus‘t returned, mam arc only now
settling into their rourirres.‘l'hc SGA cabinet,
headed by SGA President Nco Morake '09,
is one group ofstudents still trying to ﬁnd its
place on campus as the semester corrrrnues.

According to members ofthe rbirrer, rhey
have at times felt overwhelmed with duties
they had little preparation for. “The beginning
of this year, I've seen cabinet members feel a
little bewrldered at the amount of l’CSpOl‘lSlbll’
ity and lack of instruction," said Emily VVax
'09, SGA Treasurer.

Only three of the ten current Cabinet
members have prior SGA experience-aura they
spent much of these first few weeks of school
becoming familiar with their place in SGA,

“As individuals, were still learning our
positions," said Josef Schneider '09, SGA Ads

strativc Coordi aror. “We're using each
other to learn our pos ons,"

The cabinet's general inexperience with
SGA has created some internal problems
among cabinet members, arising from “not
knowing what roles we're supposed to fill,"said
Julie Hoyc '09, SGA vice president for Aca-
demic Atfairs.“ls Neo supposed to send out an
agenda for that meeting or is Joe?"

While the cabinet members said several
events they organized on campus were suc-
cessful—like the blood drive and the poster
sale—they said they will learn from less suc-
cessful things like the decreased voter turnout
at recent elections and the lack of a student {0,
rum during the Trustees’ visit this past week.

Just last year, SGA tabled outside the dln’
ing hall to promote awareness of campus deg,
tions, but this year, they did not. Between the
selection of student initiatives in the fall ser
mesters of2007 and 2008, voter turnout fell by
more than 200 students. Morake said election
board will table prior to elections in the future.
as a part of a larger cabinet campaign to in,
crease communrcntion with the student body.

john Burrows '10, SGA vice president of
Student Affairs, said the lack of communi-
cation is largely due to student unawareness
regardrng SGA’s purpose, “I feel like a lot of
people are unfamiliar with son," said John
Burrows '10, SGA vice president of Strident
Alfairs,“So they're not as comfortable coming
to us... we have to start the relationship."

Morake plans on spending a few hours
each Friday in the Grille, so students can ca—
sually meet with her, something students may
be more comfortable with than going to her
office hours.

“I want to be sure I'm seen on campus,”
Morake said. “I go to the dining hall even
though I don't like the food."

Cabinet members have maintained diar
lognc with previous sci—t oliieials, but many
said rlrcy still wish they had more tlrrection in
the start ofrhe semester. one of their goals as
a group is to document their roles to make an
easier transition fOl future Cabinets.

“One of my personal goals is working on
institutional memory Morake iitl, “Tl't's
one thing were lacking in cer in parts or
