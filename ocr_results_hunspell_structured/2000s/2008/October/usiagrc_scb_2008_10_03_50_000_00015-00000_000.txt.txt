3v NAJMA OSMAN

With n seeonrlrplaee trophy from last week’s roumament in
Cedar Rapids ar the Mt. Mercy College Invitational, and a home
course adVantnge during the Nlidwest Conference Champion-
ships, the women's golrtearn is ﬁnishing offthe season with high
hopes

Last weekend. the team surpassed expectations. “We are go-
ing into this weekend ﬁelding our best team nu season,” said Da~
vid Arseneault, the team's head coach, prior to the toumament.

Coming out of the tournament, golfers were in high spirits,
as they shot a [cam record orsoz, “We played really well and had
a lot offun,” said Ashlen Matzdorf'lL

At the St. Ambrose tournament two weeks prior in Daxrenr
pclt,Team Captain Ainy Livingston '09 became only the second
player in the Gtinnell women's Golfprogram’s history to shoot
an 18—hole round below 80, shooting a 79.

In addition to the individual successes, the team as a whole
also played well, breaking their team records, first shooting a 370
at St. Ambrose and then proceeding to break that iecorel again
with a 362 last Sunday.

If there is a reason for all the success the team is having this
season. it would be this year’s team dynamic. Arseneanlt was quick
to point out that this year’s team is the “most cohesive group,"he
has had. “The good chemistry of the team makes them a lot of
fun to coach," he said.

With the team riding a wave ofsuecess into MWC tournar
ment, the goal for next weekend is to ﬁnish second in conference.
“We Want to get as many players under 90 as possible," Livingsr
ton said.

Next weekend should be bittersweet for the teain,as the team
plays together for the lnsr time, but have a chance to showcase
themselves in front of a home crowd. “The excitement level is
really high for next weekend. A lot orus have parents and faculty
coming to see us ﬁnish our last season," said Co-captain Jordan
Hegny'o9.

With Heguy's and other teammates enthusiasm, Arseneault
believes that Grinnell will take advantage of playing on their

home course next week-“‘Iﬂinaispollcgp will come 3mg the tour— Amy Livingston '09 andﬁrddrl Hrglry '09 tum/z arrpnm dliringpr'lrllile on mdriesdaypr'epm'ingfer 21m Miriam! Cori/trait: C/mmpir
