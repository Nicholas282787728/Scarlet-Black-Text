Substance free housing: against self-gov

There's been a lot of talk about substance
free housing recently, The administration
tells us that we are going to need moie of it
soon, and they want to know wheie it should
go Before we get cairied away expanding it,
though, we should closely mine the role it
scrvcs in the Context ot’sch-goveinance.

So, why do we even have substance free
housing in the first place? The obvious answer
is that it s ~ies as a quiet place for students
who aren't ested in boozmg and smoking
the night away This interest comes in many
formsipctsonal choice, religious obligation,
or parental directiveiwhlch are all legitimate
reasons. But, when I started to think about it
in terms of self—governance, the issue got a
little bit murkicr,

My personal belief is that self-goiter»
iiaiicc mainly covers interactions with fellow
Grinncilians and, it so happens that most of
the time we think about selfrgoveriiance, it’s in
terms ofpartying. Some ofthe first cxamplcs
we give to firstryears include asking somebody

to turn their music down and clean up after
parties. lfwc all sat in our iooins and quietly
studied all the time, thcic would haidly be a

sulr, iinpoiranr to Grinncll. The more 1 think
about it, though, the more it seems mutually
exclusive to self-governance lhelieve that we

 

need for self-gov. The
fact of the matter is
that we all are living ms
gethti- and have habits
that impinge on other

should have a campusrwide
dialogue about the purposc of
substance free housing, befoie
we expand it. This is a pei-
fcct timc to critically evaluate

 

 

people's lives Self:
governance teaches us

to deal with the sticky issue ofhiimaa ilitclac»
tion likC reasonable adults.

Why, rhcn, do we have housing that re-
movcs choice from students.> Isn't pai-t ofrlic
point of coming to Grinncll that we learn to
live like a community? I'm conﬁlscd by this
apparent dichotomy of administrative philosr
ophy. To borrow the phrasing of our former
SGA President on this issue. Megan Goeiing
’08, separate is not equal.

Thing is, I’m far from militantly opposed
to substancesfrcc housing. I understand that
it is impoitant to many students, and as a re-

College policy, and therefore
a good time to involve student government,
This is an excellent opportunity for SGA to
sponsoi an open forum, or other such discusr
sion-creanng tool, to analyze campus feeling.
This issue is onc ofintcnse interest to stun
dcnt government, as well it should be, While
Grinncll must be supportive of eveiy mem
ber of its student body, it has also long been a
tradition of ours to challenge bclicfs and dill'c
students to face issues they are uncomfoitable
with. We can reconcile these two issues alt
though it might take a while. We all share a re-
sponsiblllty to examine how we want Grinncll
to be and speak up accordingly. SGA, talk to
your students. Students, talk to your SGA,

 

Professors speak out on
loss of Sheree Andrews

Recently, the college web site announced
that Sheree Andrews was "ond[ing] her service
as Associate Dean and Director for Residence
Life." Many in the Grinncll community were
distressed to hear that Sheree had been placed
on paid administrative leave at the beginning
of the semester and now are even more dis-
tressed to learn of how the matter has been re-
solved. Qlcstions abound, and we do not have
all of the answers But as privileged members
of this community, which is to say, as tenured
faculty who cannot be dismissed as easily as
was Sheree Andrews, we feel a responsibility
to speak up about what we know ofthc treat-
ment ofstaffmembcrs on this campus.

Let us state at the outset that neither Sher-
ee nor her husband, Steve, a tenured member
of the English department, have had anything
to do with this lettct, We have not spoken to
them about it. We have not spoken to them
about the resolution of their legal dispute wtth
the College; they have not spoken to us. Some
of us did speak with them about the conﬂict
when it first occurred and as it unfolded, and
these discussions inform our comments here.
Any and all information in this letter was
shared willingly by Sheree well in advance of
the settlement and with the knowledge that it
might become public Before this recent, and
disappointing, resolution, we have felt con-
strained in responding to students‘ questions.
Now we feel it is our job to educate rhose who
aie soon to become employees somewhere
about the difference between decent, fair treat
ment in the workplace and unjust treatment,

First, some crucial facts, Sheree did not
leave her job willingly, She was forced out after
nine years of service by Houston Doughcrty
and Travis Greene, who, at the time, had been
on campus for only six and three months, rc-
spcctively. Just a year earlier, Sheree had been
promoted by the College to the rank of As-
sociate Dean. And just two months bcforc
turning on her, Houston Dougherty himself
wrote in a letter that quoted from commendar
tions she had received, “I think Sheree is an
extremely valuable asset to the Grinncll Colt
lege Community. Her knowledge of Grinncll
College, the culture, her sincerity and desire to
see the best outcome for everyone involved are
characteristics that are irreplaceablel see her
continuing to grow with the new structure of,
and leadership in, student affairs,"

it is not only fair and decent but, in many
workplaces, common for employers to tell
employees if their performance puts them in
danger ofdismissal, Such employees have the
expectation that certain procedures will be fol-
lowed and ceitain measurements used, over a

period of time, to decide if firing is in order.
Faculty at Grinncll are treated in this way.
Students in danger offaillng a class are treated
in this way. Sheree Andrews was not afforded
such treatment. indeed, staff at Grinnell can
be fired without causcr Iowa is an “at will"
state, and all employers are free to fire “Ont
unionized employees “at will,"

It would be a terrible mistake to assume
that Sheree’s decision not to sue the College
for wrongful action means that she deserved
to be dismissed. Remember, just two months
before he acted, her boss had praised her per-
formance. And there is no evidence at all that
she did anything actionable in rhe interim.The
only thing that occurred in the late summer
of 2008 was a lifesandsdcath crisis in Shcrcc’s
family, the sort that would consume and uns
nerve anyone. Houston Dougherty and Travis
Greene knew of this terrible personal crisis in
Sheree's life. When these kinds of things hap-
pen on campus, they are the ones speciﬁcally
charged with telling faculty to treat students
gently, to not put undue pressure on them, to
assist with healing,

Faced with a loyal employee who was in
such crisis but continued to perfoim her du-
ties, what did Dougherty and Greene do?
They pursued termination, without any warn-
ing. Just days after her husband, Steve, left
town to serve as the faculty advisor for the
Grinncll in Washington program they acted
aggressively to terminate her Given the op
portunity to model the kind of conﬂict rcsos
lution and humane mediation that he coun~
sels on campus, President Russell l<. Osgood
declined to halt the severance pioccss. There
was the public show of Sheree being put on
“administrative leave," but that leave time was
never used to dctcrminc how to retain hot SCI'T
vice to the College.

Again, do not assume that Shctcc’s silcncc
in the face of this injustice means that she is
guilty ofprofessional wrongdoing. There is no
evidence ofthat in her (vcry, very slim) person—
nel file. imagine, instead, that the College's
lawyers made it abundantly clear that the in-
stitution could outspend and outlast any legal
action Sheree and Steve might contemplate.
And know that with respect to Sllcrcc’s stat
tus as staff, not faculty, the deck was stacked
against them, As ihc parents of two children,
with now only one job between them, they
took the prudent course: they reachcd a settler
ment out ofcourt.

We will never know how much orlittle the
College paid, in effect, to silence Sheree and
Steve Andrews. Grinncll is a wealthy, private
institution that can cloak its labor practices in
secrecy and will, ofcoursc, claim that wc don't
know all of tllc facts, Wu arc frankly too fat
miliar with this use ofpowcr to discredit those

who cry foul.

The only resolution we can come to as a
community is to be alert to how the current
administration sometimes uses its power and
wealth to Violate the principles of justice it
touts as our common values. This letter is our
protest against this abuse of community trust,
someone once wrote, “Expecting the world to
treat you fairly because you are a good person
is a little like expecting a bull not to attack you
because you are a vegetarian.” The shock to
Sheree and Steve and to their colleagues in-
volves the belief that Grinncll is different:
more open, more decent, more caring, and
more just than most places. But, sadly, this is
not the case

As colleagues, we can mourn the loss of
Sheree from StudentAffairs since,inoureaper
rience, she was uniquely sensitive to students,
parents, and faculty. Finally, we can prepare
ourselves to mourn the loss of Steve Andrews
from the English department. We will likely
lose this fine teacher and scholar, one of only
12 tenured faculty of color on campus, Why?
Well, ask yourself: would you continue to work
for an institution that treats your family in
this way? The current recession will delay his
departure, but we know this breach lS endure
ing. Trust all around has been violated, and we
regret the lasting, painful lesson: “justice is a
concept. Muscle is the reality.”

Pro-Thanksgiving thanks

My family and l were among the lucky
ones who responded to the open invitation to
the local foods prerThanksgiving dinner on
Sunday, November 23, in Quad, We want to
thank the organizers, cooks, and other volul‘r
teers, especially the organlzci-inrchicf, Hart
Ford-Hodges, for all the time and effort they
spent to create a delicious, diverse, and divert-
ing dining experience. The meal benefirred not
only all ofus locavorcs, but also a host oflocal
producers, and thus the local economy and the
environment (few or no chemicals involved in
producing the food, far fewer shipping miles
that would have bccn nccdcd with convent
tional suppliers to get the food here). This
happy event will surely help grow demand for
local food ar Grinncll College.
