w/lit/l premier 11M finding: e/e/ic Gallup poll.

In “Muslim True/False," an article you wrote for the LA
Times, you wrote, “Americans are bombarded everyday with
news stories about Muslims and majoriteruslim countries,
in which vocal extremists, not evidence, drive perceptions."
How do you thinkAmericans can get a more unbiased report
on the Islamic world?

I think that rherc are a variety of ways in which we've done
it in die pasr. You have people who do srudics and do research
in certain areas. Burl think that we want to talk in a widespread
way because a lot ofqucstions are put in this way, People look
and say rhcre's anri-Americanism out rhere and then rhc ques-
tion is “do they hate us?"lt’s not, “do people in this city, in this
country [hate us]". I think that’s where you have to rely on,
among other things, polling.

There are some very good polls out there. From my point
of view, the two best right now are probably Gallup and Pew.
Gauup is the largest, most comprehensive poll ever done. The
Gallup poll is over a prolonged period of time and is Very sySr
tematic, in terms of the way it grids a country, in terms ofinter-
viewing in urban, rural, village areas, in terms of socioeconomic,
demographic, sexualﬂll of that’s there What that really does
enable us to do is to listen ro the voices rhat rcpresenr a billion
Muslims on the key issues, which gets you beyond whether you
see me on CNN or so and so on CNN or Fox and we're both
visibly acknowledged experts, bur we're giving diamerrically
opposed opinions about what they think It's what I like to call
a reality check.

In the same article, you also wrote, “It’s polities, not piety
that drives the small minority—just 7 percent—of Muslims

to nnti-Americanism at the level of condoning the attacks of
9/11,"

We need to take scvcn percent very seriously because that
would be 91 million people. But I think thats one ofthe prob-
lems we have when we look at the Muslim world. It's true [that
politics drive violence] when you also look at violence commit
ted in other traditions and in other situations Whether it's in
the form onugoslavia or in India today or sri Lanka, is the
driving force religion or is it non Certainly. often the people
who do ir belong to a religion, and rheir rhetoric is ofren rclir
gious. But I would argue rhatit’s politics,it’s political issues, it's
political grievances. it’s particularly the perception or experis
cncc ofoccuparion that drives people.

Now, if they're religious folk or rhey Want to mobilize reli-
gious folk, then obviously they appeal to religion to legitimarc
what they are doing. And that does rake place, and that religious
rhcroric is rhcrc, and religion does play a role, bur more ofrcn
than not it can be very deceptive if one thinks that religion is
rhc primary driver. The way you know it is that you look at one
of Osama Bin Laden’s speeches and the whole first part deals
with poliricil and economic grievances, and then he appeals ro
religion, But he doesn’t start by saying the Qiran says this and
rhur’s why we're engaging in this war.

What are some interesting ﬁnds that you‘ve dug up in
your research?

I was certainly dclighrcd with the tacr that rhcre's a good
deal of data that corroborates a lot of what I’ve been saying. For
many peoplc,wharwill strike rhem is that our data goes against
some of the conventional wisdom. For example, the notion that
they hate us because otwho we are, because of our democracy,
our human rights record, is not the case. The ,
drivers are things like people who rcscnt what _
rhcy see as an aggressive, unilarcral, nco-colonial
approach, people who believe that we denigrate
Islam and look down on Muslims.

But when you ask, “What do you admire?"
vast majoriiics of Muslims ralk about admiring
the West, its freedoms, its work ethic. When
Americans are asked, “What do you admire _
about Islam?" 57 percent say nothing or “I don't _
know." I think that the other interesting thing
is that majorities of women and men in Mus-
hm countries believe that women should have equal rights as
citizens.

Do you ﬁnd that today's generation ofyouth is well in-
formed about global and domestic issues?

I think that today’s students are far more in-
formed than [students] when l was in school and
when I began to teach. I can remember back dui"
ing the Vietnam War and the Civil Righrs move-
ment and being amazed that there were all kinds
of students who didn't have a clue until all of that
occurred. ljust started a new semester, and I asked
how many of my students had studied anything on
Islam or the Middle East and often at least half of
them have I think students are more aware than
they were years ago.

But I think that one ofthe issues is,“What are
rhey aware of? [and] What becomes their ulrimate source crin-
formation?”To the extent that they live in a world where media
plays an important role,I tend ro faulr rlie media pretty heavily
Students will have really strong opinions, but how accurate and
well»int’ormcd they are becomes another question.

 

With the presidential election a mere two
months away, some candidates might think
it unnecessary to expend precious campaign
resources on a studcnr body mostly set in its
political ideology. But on Monday irrernoon,
The Campus Democrats hosted a short open
forum with two kcv 'ns: advisors tn the
Barack Obama camp gniformcr secretary
of the Navy under Bill Clinton Richard Dan-
zig and Director otrhc Carr Center for Hu—
man Rights Policy Sarah Sewall

Addressing questions relarcd m Obamas
defense policy, each advisor spoke quite can-
didly, applying only a minimal amount of
political spin. After establishing that all but
one member of the crowded conference room
had already pledged to vote for Obama, Dan—
zig and Sewall ans
swered questions
Without the fear or'

ed voters,

Danzig and
scwall immediately opened rhc ﬂoor to ques-
tions,letting Grinnellians shape the discussion.
Addressing topics such is the Russiaeccorgia
Conﬂict, U.$. relations with Afghanistan and
Pakistan, and Obama’s stances on worldwide
humanitarian intervention, rhe speakers clears
ly laid out Obama’s dcfensc plan.

The advisors continually emphasized
Obama's support of pragmatic. openrminded
policies in foreign relations, focusing on pre-
vention rather than reaction. While the speak—
ers occasionally made rererence to John Mcs
Cain’s rigid and aggressive way ofdealing wirh
the foreign issues, the session maintained its
generally acadcmic feel while rarely sounding
pteachy,

both Danzig and Small spoke of Obami’s
support for Georgian sovereignty ind his ads
Vocacy for a srrong but pragmatic response to
Russian iggression. Obama‘s plan would be
“nested in his biuider ideology ofhuw to deal
with the world," Scwcll said. “Barack secs the
need to be strong and clear with Russra while
developing in international consensus,” she
said.

They also discussed Obim-i's plan to more
efficiently concenrraec U.S resources in Af-
ghanisran. Whilc anzlg stated “our ultimate
aim should be for withdlawill,” he indicated the
need for the us. to first strcngrhen Afghan

political structure. “After retaliating for 9/11.

country “a potential haven for terrorists."

But even within this academic setting, a more
complicated explanation may have proved
confusing during the relatively brief session.
And the notion that our country should not
repeat its post-Chatlie Wilson experience in
Afghanistan is a good one.

Perhaps rhe speakers mosr convincing an-

would respond to serious human rights abuse
if there was not an international consensus.
Rather than simply taking one extreme side,
Danzig speculated that Obama’s pmgmatism
