Campus bands get ready for_wild time

With a title taken from a Discovery Chair
ncl show about theoretical animal battles, the
first Frecsound campus bands show ofthe year
aims to be both raucous and loud.

on Saturday, ninc campus bands will be
performing in Gardner Lounge starting at
9 pm, in .1 concert called “Animal FacerOff:
Hippo vs. Freesonnd".

The perfect symmetry of the bands and
timing belies the fact that both veteran and
extremely new bandsisome as new as only a
few weeks oldiwill be playing in the show.
The veterans include White People Music,
one ofthe most idiosyncratic and longestslasts
ing bands on campus, having played together
for nearly a year. Since Daniel Furuta ’08 starts
ed the group, they released their Break/arr EP
on Freesound Records and have played several
shows on campus.

A trio, White People Music consists of
Chris Farstad ’09 on drums, Furuta on vocals
and bass, and Soleil Ho '09, on vocals and gui-
tar. Singing rapidly and playing fiercely, White
People Music is reminiscent of late 70's punk
bands like The Ramones and The Sex Pistols.
Ho described White People Music's sound as
“hard, fast, and wet. "

White People Music's punk sound is also
backed by playful lyrics. “Our songs are mostly
irreverent without a strong message,” Furiita
said.

The band's songwriting process focuses
on building from basic themes. “We come up
With a theme and then we write lyrics about
it," he said. Topics of the songs range from
piano—playing cats to Scientology to Eriya.

White People Music's members, in keep-
ing with their unorthodox approach, also use
their other senses (and a healthy dose of sar-
casm) to figure out what songs to write. “My
lyrical inﬂuence is Google Image Search,"Ho
said,

Overall, the music in the Freesound show
will be as different as the lyrical topics and
musical choices ofWhite People Music, One
band will be playing only popular covers of
bands like Sublime and BluesTraveler, another
artist will be making acoustic, loop-based mu-

sic, and another will be playing solo electronic
dance music with live vocals.

Some students will even be playing in
multiple bands with different styles. “A lot of
the bands are collaborative," said Mike Kober
’10, co-leader of Freesound. “There are certain
Freesound members who contribute to many
groupsil [myself] am going to be in three difs
ferent groups."

Kober hopes that the concert, and future

events like it, will help to also give a unique life
to the weekend at Grinnell, “There isn’t much
to do on the weekend, as for creative output,"
Kober said. “We want our events to serve as a
place where people can find a home and bring
some energy."

Furuta also hopes that the concert will
bring the campus together, though in a similar
way to listening to a White People Music con»
cert (or hearing about a battle between Frees

sound and a Hippo), it's hard to tell whether
he is being snurky or genuine.

“We just want to see people of all races,
ethnicities, crccds, sexual orientations, and
gender identities getting along, loving each
other," he said,

The chances of that happening might be
merely theoretical, but if anything could do it,
great campus hands might.

Course expands horizons for art and science

Kat York ’09 talks about her short course, her love of pigs, and how imagination can be turned into reality

Pigs have been my favorite animal for just
about as long as I can remember. No joke. Just
ask my parents. As a child, I used to collect
piggy banks, pig figurines, and stuffed animal
i s.

p gYou can imagine my surprise, then, when
I learned a few weeks ago that pigs—v-my very
own favorite animal—just might be able to ﬂy.
With the help, of course, of science, art, and
specifically, the hard work of the Tissue Cult
ture and Art Project.

Based in Western Australia, Tissue Cul-
ture and Art is a group of scientists, artists, and
“scientartists”
devoted to crer
ating artworks
using biological
technology—t
specifically by ,
using tissue
technologies.

Among oth-
er projects such
as cultivating victimless learher and creating
semirliving worry dolls, mom is using as
sue engineering and stem cell technologies to
grow pig t' he in th - ipc ofwnig-

The P Wi gs project began with colr
letting Mescnchynial cells (bone marrow stem
cells) from a pig. These cells were a er differ
enriated into bone and until: 0 and motleletl

after three basic wing rypes.The Chiroprernn
model (wings stretched over hand-like bone
structures in a bat-like style), the Aves model
(birddikc), and a Ptcrosaurs model (ptcrodac-
ryl style).

“The Pig wings installation presents the
first ever wing shaped objects grown using
living pig tissue, alongside the environment
in which such endeavour can rake place." the
TCbcA website reads, “We will attempt to
present living tissuerengincercd pig wings that
will be animated using living muscles".

Real pig wings. When pigs fly. we use the
cliche all the
time, but
who knew
how close it
is to becom-
rug reality?

lcarnedabout
TC8<A in
the short
course “Biology as the New l\’lcdulm,"Ti\ught
by Visiting Professor and Artist Marta dc Mes
nezes, the class mccts nvicc a week in a Bis
ology lab in Noyce and once in the sculpture
studio in the basement ofllucltshauiil.

A few of the projects we've done f ' tl 's
class so Far include "pilinling"lvitl\ the has \
sci ratia, attempting to mampulaic and tlucus

 

merit the flight patterns offruir flies, and using
another (considerably smellier) bacteria called
Pseudomonas putiola to descolor paintings
that we made using dyes.

Using Biology for art is a relatively new
idea.

The field is young and the number of
people involved in biological expressions of
art is coirespondingly small. Much remains to
be explored in this particular medium, which,
frankly, blows my mind.

Talking to my classmates, I found that
whllt excited most people was the room for
creativity that the class provides us with.

This new dialogue between the scientific
and the aesthetic (scistheric) bridges a tradi-
tionally irreconcilable gap and opens doors in
both fields.

Jackie Groves ’09, an Art and Biology
double major, feels that this class, and moic
broadly, this genre. “combines art and biology
in a way that no one at Grinnell has presented
either subject before." Namely, in a way that
ﬂies up oiii imaginations and makes students
think about both tilt and biology fiom new
angles.

I guess what it all boils down to for in s
how wonderful it is to hear about the differ
ent ways that people interpiet using biology
for it. Branching outside or more riaditionul
media bring. .n cncrgy to the art mom (or

bio lab) that I had never before experienced
at Grinnell.

The ideas being tossed around arc incred-
ibly fresh, Paper sculptures crusted with fungi
and seedlings, grass grown in the shape of a
student’s fingertip, a poem written using Mens
del's paper on genetics...the world is anyone's
oyster when it comes to using biology—the
study of life~and this class has proved that
to me.

“As an artist I'm in constant search for
meaning,” said Professor de Menezes, “to EXT
press my discoveries and questions unanswered
through biology as my art is the most exciting
thing I can think of. Also I can learn about
things that 1 never thought I would, and that
challenges me every new project i start!”

If this kind of interdisciplinary thinking
and creativity cominucsnvho knows> Pigsjust
might ﬂy.

 

The ”Biology As a New ‘
Medium” class will hold its
”Search For Meaning” exhi—
bition tonight at 4:15 pm.
