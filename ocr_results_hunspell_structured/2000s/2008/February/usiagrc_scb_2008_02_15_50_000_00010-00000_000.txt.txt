Flame on: Laurel

BYNATE BONNELL

While the weather outside may indeed be frightful, in
the ﬁreplace lounge, the ﬁre has not been so delightful. In
fact, it has not really been there at lllliuntil now.

Aftel being plagued with technical diffculties, the
lounge will now have ﬁres more frequently, and the change
may draw more students inro the space. But the technical
ditﬁculties appear to continue.

According to Michael Sims, senior associate dean For
student Affairs, the ﬁreplace stopped working last semes
ter after the igniter went out. Afterwecks ofdclayutht: new
igniter ﬁnally arrived.

But afei only a few days,
the igniter stopped working
again.

It now works “on and
off," Sims said. “We haven't
quite ﬁgured out what it is.”

Recently, a new coma
plieation has come to light.
When the ﬁreplace burns
for a long time, ash evident-
ly builds up and clogs rhe switch mechanism, so rhar it
may not light unless someone manually clears It out. This
became apparent only last Friday.

In the lounge, the now burning ﬁre met with a good
mood and approval. Brie Bieler‘ll said it was the ﬁrst time
shed seen the ﬁre burning. “I really appreciate it being on,
just because it's warm and it's cold outside," she said.

“sometimes I’ll pop in and pop out," said Maggie Kn»
mraezcwski ’10, but ﬁnding
the fire on, also for the first
time, on Tuesday, she den
cided to stay. “It’s as good a
place as any to study. Coziet
chairs and a ﬁreplace can't
be beat"

FM continues ﬁxing new
problems as they come up.

Sims said it takes about
two years to get familiar With all the quirks ofa new buildr
ing, and that no one is trying to keep it shut offﬁit’s just
been a cascading series oftechnical issues. “Ifanybody asks
for it to be on,”said Sims,“the staffwill go and turn it on.”
That is, barring any problems with the ﬁreplace itself.

We can look forward to relaxing in front of the ﬁre
whenever we want, pretty soon. As long as nothing goes
wrong.

Looking to saristy a Mexican food craving, a few friends
and I took a drive to La Cabana, the chorizo and salsa oasis

I had hoped for and more.

an understatement. The burrito was enormous and enoi—
