Students question
dining hall “neutrality”

BV OMARMUNOZ

Student actions conﬂicted with policies or neuttality as they
attempted to celchl'atc the end oithc Day orSilence with qucct
ptide tlags last Ft

sitttlcnts wete denied cntly into the dining hall because they
carried pride ﬂags that violated neuttality rules of the dining hall.
ln lesponse, students petitioned administrators to change the
titles, and also snuck ﬂags into the dinning hall in deﬁance,

According to Lindsay Dennis '03, she and othet students
ttitd to ln-ing a plastic bag filled with tings into the dinning hall.
The chECLCt stopped them and told them they could not snag
the ﬂags in because they wanted to keep the dining hall a neutral
s ace.

P The discussion between the checker and students eventlr
ally led to a call to Dick W'illiams, director of Dining Services,
who explained school policies in tegattls to neututlity via email
Williams said the teasons he disallowed tlags in the dining hall
eoncotnetl was to maintain a neutial dinning hall. “I explained to
the individual on the telephone that the dining hall is ConSldctcd
‘neuttal gtonad,“ he wtotc. “And in order to tespect the tights
and beliefs of all students we asked that they do not put up a
display in the lvlatltetplace,"

Dennis said she felt that students weie angry over interpreta-
tions of the ﬂag. “We were upset that Dick Williams said that
people would be en’endcd by the ﬂags," she said.

students found othet means to get the ﬂags into the dining
hall. Dayna Hamann '09 was intotnied ofthe incident by fiiends
and later took part in an attempt to re—entet the dining hall with
ﬂags. “I decided to go out the back entiance and took the ﬂags
in thtough the back,” she said. “We put them up on some chaits
and displayed them and then wore them out as we left,"

As with an cathet decision to ptcvcnt displays ottainhoWe
stripped pride ﬂags on mail boxes, the event prompted students
to appeal to administrators Elena Bernal ’94, special assistant
to the ptesident tot Diversity and Achievement, and Houston
Doughatty, vice ptesident tot Student Attaits, Betaal said she
and Doughatty decided to open dialogue with othet adminismr
tots about such rules,

“Houston and I ate talking to out colleagues and we’te wetlt-
ing on updating these policies," said Beinal. “And we thought
that one of the ways we could show solidarity and that we un»
detstaod and that we had done our part was we came in together
mapped in ptide ﬂags."

Hamann said she felt there had been inconsistencies with the
application of the tule in ptevious yeats. “We had the ﬂags in
the dining hall last year,” she said. “It felt like ‘it was particularly
inappropriate time to start enforcing tules, given what’s been go-
ing on.

Referencing the student handbook. Williams said that the
neutrality title is longstanding and has been applied to all groups
of students. “This policy is not new and has been pait of the
campus community tot many yeats,"Wtote Williams.
