The Men's Quadrangle, now known as
North Campus, was completed in 1917,
shortly after the Women's Quadrangle
(South Campus) was built in 1915.Until
1968,0ne housed onlymcn and the other
only women.

All the dorms in the col-
lege are now cored, but several
ﬂoors are still singlersex, Some
of these ﬂoors will always be
singlersex, said Jennifer krchn,
Dean for Student Life, for the
simple reason that they have
only one bathroom. Dibble An—

Other ﬂoors are not restricted in
this way but are still single-sex. Krohn
said that the number ofsingle-sex ﬂoors
is usually right about on par with the
number of singlerser dorms requested
each year and the number or” ﬂoors has
remained fairly consistent since the mid
805.

difﬁcult,"said Brian Davis '09, who lives on the ﬂoor. “I think that
the idea ofgender neutral bathrooms and extending it to the rest
ofthe campus nulliﬁes all that anxiety."

“I think it has been really successful and has developed a lot of
allies and raised awareness ofgender-neutral housing on campus,"
said Taylor“, one of the students who requested gender-neutral
housing

While two bathrooms were already gender neutral. the ﬂoor
voted to make the other two genderrneutrtl as well.

“I think it shows that the students don't need to be on the
conservative side otgender-neurrnl,"HindsrBrush said, discussing
the bathroom votes.

Students on the ﬂoor are also hoping to see the policy ex-
panded.

"The school did what it could, butI think they had loftier goals
which didn't follow through." said Jordan“, the other student who
requested gender-neutral housing, and the ﬁrst person to make that
request in the history ofthe college, “There was a feeling that more
focus on education ro the general campus would occur."

When this further education did not transpire, a commitrce was
formed to look into the issue. This committee has
been working wirh the administration and wrote
student initiatives to raise awareness of gender-
iieutral housing. The initiatives, which passed two
wceks ago. will add gender identity and explcssion
to rhe college's non discrimination policy and may
turn single-stall bathrooms in academic building to
gender neutral.

Housing committee has discussed possibilities or
further expanding gender-neutral housing. “We've
talked about adding another ﬂoor or making it all
of Loose Secoitd,”said HindsrBrush. Currently the
,commiircc is discussing other Issues, but a decision will be made
before room draw,

srudents expressed interest in extending gentlerrneutruliry. “I
think that it should extend to other parts ofcampus," said Davis,
“I think it's necessary—it makes in: feel more comfortable.

As Jordan said, “[we'te] rrying to make the Campus safer in
general. which, after what just happened, seems even more im-
portant,"

on Haines Third, said that
all-female ﬂoors are “not nun-
neries,"Guys are often coming
and going, and ofcourse, girls
leave the rooms as well,

Underwood said one beneﬁt of an
all-girl ﬂoor is that it allows for study
breaks rhat are geared more toward girlsr
She had ended up on rhe ﬂoor by chance,
but said she thinks she’s more comfort—
able living with females,

Simon Kantcr '11 orallrmale James
Third described the ﬂoor as a “miracle
assembly," rhough he also said it's prob
ably much like any other hall. Daniel
Schneider ‘10, also on James Third, said
the strong ﬂoor community probably had
something to do with luck and not its

nature as an all-male ﬂoor.

However, the James Third guys extol
the benehts ofliving on an all-male tioor.
“I guess we don't have to wear pants as
often,"said Schneider, Greg Swanson ’10
remarked that the ﬂoor had not had its
customary “shirtless o’clock" in a while.

All ofthe Haines andJames denizens
interviewed ended up on their ﬂoors
wirhout consciously choosing a singlersex
ﬂoor, but ifthere was any dissatisfaction
with rhe setup, it was fairly mild. “I do
worry about not hnvmg as mrmy guy
friends,”said Underwood. “It inﬂuences
friendships,"

Jan Koszewski’OS, SGA VPSA,who
is a member of Housing Committee,
said he could not remember getting a
complaint about a singlersex dorm ﬂoor
layoutt “The system has been relatively
calm," wirh nothing needing changing,
he said.“l haven't seen anyone push for
more or less single-sex housing," he id.
“It’s certainly a conversation i’d be wi ng
to entertain if there was a push for it."
But it seems everyone's pretty comforts
able with the arrangements as they are.
