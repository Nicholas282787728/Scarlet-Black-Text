Student’s ‘Rocky Horror’

SENIOR ISSUE

 

 

Amanda McGillivray feels a little awk-
ward around most people. Except, orcourse,
when she’s onstage dressed as a transvestite,
performing rnoek sexual acts to a song and
dance routine.

While she keeps rather quiet in most
of her life, McGil—
liytay’s obsession with
the culr ﬁlm Rocky
Horror Picture Show
began at age is and
has since led her re
spend her breaks
from school dolled

and heels performing

Rocky shows trsually occur at midrrighr,
when casts of regular Rockyrloiring folks

“people get to dress up and yell obscene

hricGillivray's favorite character in the
bizarre minis Columbra, the luscious-lipped
lab assistant to the ﬁlm's quasi»protogonist,
the ttansvestite evil scientist Dr. Franken-
futtcr. McGillnttay and her mom spent an
entire year sewnrg gold sequins one by one
onto a rancy tailcoat to create a shimmer
ing r-eplica ot‘tlre one Colurnbra wears in the
ﬁlm “She's so llashy that yotr have to give
her due justice," explained MeGillvray.

As an organizer and key actor rn the an-
nual Grinrrell Rocky show, though, she has
discovered she actrrally prefers perfotmrng
the role ofDr, Frankenflirtet,“The irony Oh
girl playing a mule who's a transvestite~1 get
a big kick out ortlrar,"she said, gunning.

Despite performing with the Los An-
geles Rocky cast for two summers while
at Grrnrrell, McGillivtay says she still gets
nervous before every show. "Being in linr
gerie for 100 percent of the show rs a little
nerve-wrackitig," she said. once the show
gets starred though, “I'm usually just haw
rug a good tirrre You're not yourself, you're a
eharacter. Plus. us so dark in there you can't
see anyone anyway." And, she added, it is
deﬁnitely brrilr up lret Harris conﬁdence.

While even her good friends have ttour
ble recognizing McGillivtay rn her Rocky
make rrp and costume, she's a recognizable
person on campus thanks in pan to outﬁts
incorporating "bondage pants" and her 15
piercings (sternum, neck, two lip rings and
12 earrrngs). “I don't really understand my
obsession with piercings. I just like rhern,"
she sard, “I stopped because] have nowhere
else 1 want to put them. I'm going to focus
on getting more tattoos,"

All the body hardware in small town

wrrh assumptions firmly in mind. “A lot or

In reality, McGillivtay said she only drinks
occasionally and doesn't do any drugs. She’s
