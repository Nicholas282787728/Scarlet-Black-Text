sysrcm and srill survive all foul yelus .rr Glinncll
Ioaiinis Lnulmkjs is your man. Ofrcn referred
ro on campus as ‘Oh'! Thar kid who plays rlrc
harmonica,y if there's nnyone who knows how
ro make rhc Grrnnell espcnencc cvcryrhing bur
academically ercssful, Ir's Louklilds. For him, life
is all liboul love

A senior from Gleecc, Louknkis came to
Grinnell on a scholarship awardcdcd ro one sru—
dent annuallv at his high school He had intends
ed to be an Economics maior our changed hrs
rrrind aﬁcropcrrencrng life in Arncrica ﬁrsllinnd.
“Americu' ls rlie land of l\\.\'\\l’V Push a button and
everytl'ung rs done for you," Loukalcis said

“AllI had to do \m slccp,cnl imd study How
can rhar be hard?" Seeing rhis case as an opporr
runiry ro oplore his rruc passions, Loukakrs
swnchcd hrs major ro music, his one love,

Lorricakis soon came ro Iivc all his lifc in pur-
suit of love. “I come from rhe land of love,” he
said. “The ﬁrst nine 1 ran away from lromc, no
one even bolhercd to look for me or inform rhe
police cause i: was cakcn for granrcd drar l was rn
love and wirh my gillfriend,"

While mosr Grinncllians are busy planning
how so sorreeae love and fun inro planncr vvirh
rheir myriad class and exuncurriculnr commie
Inents, love hikes cenrer srnge for Lonkdes. “lfl
had drc choicc benvccn ﬁnishing up a isspage
paper due rhc ncxr day and a nighr of passion-
ate love," said Louknkis. “It
would, wirhour a qrrcsrion, be
rlielalree”

While he said Gl'innell
has been a srmagely interr
esring experience and mrher
cularrally cnliglrrcning, Lliis
graduating Music major srill remains buﬁlcd ar
the orrrcmcly acadcnuc narruc of rhis campus

rhc rcsr."Loukakis said, "Thar doesn’r make me
a bad or irresponsible studenr, hurjusr onc wlro
appreciares who love has so offer”

His passion for love has nor prevcnred
him flom graduaring clus scmcsrer. “I've been
drrough semcsrcrs of 2.0 GPAs and rhen rhosc

wrrlr 4.0 GPAs—ir's jusr
1 mar life is a whole load
more rhan iusr a papcr or

; agrade,"

r On a more academic

note, Loukalsis's expe-
done: at Grinnell has
nor been as fulﬁlling as
hc hoped. Hc plavs born rho guirar andg rhe

macsuo ar rhe harmonica by others on campus,
bur he behercs he is nor crcn rcmorely close ro

music becausc he has been limited in pursuing
his love of music.

“How can you aspect me to be good at any
thing, speciﬁcally music, iiyou are going ro limir
rhc number ofcredirs I can rake in a panicular
course area>"

When asked what he plans to do after gradu-
adon, he replied wirh an almosr discomfoningly
conﬁdent lone, “Go back to Greece and work ar
a booksrorc, like I did during my gap year. I don’t
feel like I’ve gained any skills in pardcular aver
rhc lasr four years that will let me do anyrlaing
else, and as far as music is conoemed, I’m nor
good enough ro apply ro grad school and earn
afford scarring over either."

While Ioannis’ openencc ar Grinnell he
been quire unlike mosr other seniors. it provides
an opportunity ro perceive Gnnnell with the
hcarr as opposed xo only the inrellccr

Student pursues activism, multiculturalism

For mosr people, choosing where ro go ro

was co-lcadcr rhis year. Gerrmg used to living
in an unknown small rowII was made surprise
ingly easier as she became very involved in rhc

mainly involved wirla SOL has allowed me ro

Rerolorio said. "It's iusr allowed me so explore
my aciivism overall.”

Though she has appreciarcd how her are
rivism has led to grcarcr involvcmcnr in rhc
