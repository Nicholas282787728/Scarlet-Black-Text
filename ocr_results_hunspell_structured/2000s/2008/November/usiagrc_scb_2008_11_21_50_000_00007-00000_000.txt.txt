Why did you decide to make I Was a Teenage Femirtitt?

I was taking a documentary class and we had to do a pro»
posal for a ﬁlm, and the instructor said,“Do something that you
really feel sttongly about that you can live with for four years
because that's how long it will take to make
the movie."

I was thinking about a lot of things about
turning 40, approaching 40, how my life turned
out, and whether this was how I thought it
would be. And I was thinking back to (hi: last
time I felt strong in my decisions and convic»
tions.

It was when I was a teenager when 1 dis»
covered these ideas offeminism through “Free
to Be You and Me",which was a TV show. So
I started thinking: what happened to this feminism that really
changed my life when l was a teenager? It’I even say the word
feminism now, people look at me funny and treat it like a dirty
word.

What was feminism like in the 19705, and how does it
compare with the contemporary incarnation of feminism?

lwasn’t a really political person. I was just a kid in the suhr
urbs. Bur,l remember that the ideas of feminism were all over
the place; itjust exploded. I remember that it was a completely
different way or thinking about your life. It was sort of the idea
that you could do whatever you wanted, you didn't have to wait
for the handsome prince to ﬁx your life for you.

we were like the ﬁtst generation of kids that really got that
message. Much, much more so than now, there were a lot or
things going on around us. There were characters on TV that

really were great role models for independent women. 50, it
was all around and unapologetic. Now, you'd have people think
it was preachy.

How can the values offeminisn-i be extended to today?

I’m looking at it through a viewpoint of feminism. And is-
sues that arc important to women's lives and health and freedom
and happiness are very important to me. I think that the urn
derlying idea is people being ahle to make their own decisions
in their lives and being able to do things without other people
looking at them and saying you're wrong or you’re weird.

This relates to the elections now, with Proposition Eight
in California. Basically, California voted to say, “We want gay
marriage completely outlawed, and ityoure gay and you’re in
love with your partner you dont have the kind or same rights
as heterosexuals.”

So,[ think that’s not a feminist thing per say, but it’s the
same sort of thing where people want to
live their lives and have equal rights with
people around them, and they're being told,
“No, you can't, no, you're deviant, no, there's
something wrong with you, no, God hates

g/dea/ people

What’s your next ﬁlm, The American
Virgin, about?

It’s using the idea of virginity, the im-
portance of virginity, and the meaning of
virginity to look at how we deal with female sexuality, especially
oryounger women, It's partly about a lot otstuttthat has to do
with abstilicnckthis sort of religious behavior that restricts
information in the name or God, and things like hypersexur
allized images that we see in the media, that mixed message
that girls get.

And what is virginity, anyway? can you even define it?
What does it mean? Is it some anatomical (hing) How does a
lesbian lose her virginity.> Well, gay women have very distinct
ideas about when rhey lost their virginity. but it may not he the
“government mandated"deﬁnition.The ﬁlm grew out ofI Wat
tr Teenage Feminill, and grew out of people trying to define who
you are and deﬁne why that's good or why that's bad.You know,
dent teLl me who 1 am, I’m going to tell you who I am.
