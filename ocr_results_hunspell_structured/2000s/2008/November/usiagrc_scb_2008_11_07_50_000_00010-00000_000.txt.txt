Grandma says “don’t bite your fingernails”

Darcy Ward ‘09 takes a closer look at the science, and the fungus, behind those nasty hangnails

My only surviving grandparent is one nfrhc
best puterogethcr people I knowAlthough she
is wrinkly (as the elderly tend to be) Grand-
momlny looks much better at 83 than 1 do
at 21. Simply put, she knows how to appear-
presentable, something which i take stabs at
only occasionally and have all the strcccss of a
eolol-blind drunk.

When lwas entering the throes of my awk—
ward decade and had just
picked up a vigorous nail-
biting habit, she explained H
to me that the fclllillillinl i
ota lady was judged by her-
hands, and mangling thcm
wasn't consider-ed attractive in the best Complv
ny. Now, I am going to go ahead and guess that
in general lack oigroonung, tendency tor rr
in is sweaters, 1 ud inability to properly apply
makeup take the out of contention for lady
hood before the (green can get close enough
to see my nails. But supposing that her man:
csty did get clo nougb tn pcck at them,,
would see the C\'ldC“CC of 10 years worth ofmi‘
weir-d little dcsirc to mutilate my Ctlliclcs

This is something you have probably seen
me do, as I am constantly trying to remove
one last little hanguail. It's sort or like prune
ing, except most gar-donors don't use their teeth
to keep bushes in controlThiit, and they don’t
overprune, get unreasonably upset, and are
tempt m yank out the bush in frustration'l‘hat
would make them look Clazy . ..

Although 45 percent of teenagers and 20
percent of young adults bite their nails, a brief
survey of the information available online
seems to suggest that it is a vice of consider-
able import. The “disfiguring" hang-ups or
hang-nails are caused by massive infections of

Begin with committee reports

Hugh Redford has brought up a really
good point about Joint Board reform in his
SGA column for the 588: it is a wonder
nil way to become incredibly informed about
how the college works at almost any level and
is tremendously helpful for any student group
or activists trying to learn the organizational
ropes at Grinnell. However, almost no one
does come, and this is understandable; bud»
gets and resolution walk is oftentimes tedious
and boring, especially when Joint Board has to
delve into the actual senatorial work of pais-
ing words. However, the way l see it, there’s an
easy and etrcctive way to reform Joint Board

But masculinity, pell’litps? What could

it would grow back partially, and then get torn

right after soap box. These reports are by
far the most useful part ofJoint Board; they

and what obstacles presented themselves.

To my great disappointment, my brother's
toes actually look pretty normal without them.
He has skin in the place of nail which makes
them a little more sensitive, bur not painful.
Much more painlirl, actually, were the ingrown
toenails we were both prone to.

If you don‘t cut your nails properly or are
just disliked by God, your toenail can deviate
from its proscribed unidirectional path and
plunge into the ﬂesh oryoui toe. For what
ever reason, it the nail isn't squirted off when
you are cutting it (rathui than ioiintied) it gets
confused and wanders offcourse.This is every
bit as paint'ul as rt sounds, as were my father’s
home suigeries to rectify the situariun, which
iirrolred such higherech methods as putting
some ice on the red, throbbing area, and then
cutting down the side or my toenail, vertically,
to remove the offending piece. It bled a lot.

Eventually I got real surgery on it, and the
gronth center otthe piece or toenail that kept
causing problems was silenced roiercr. I got to
watch, which almost made the whole experi-
ence worth it. I also got to keep the chunk they
took out or my toe in a jar, which was deri-
nircly worth it.

when and where to expect. Moreover, it would
provide a better context for the rest orthe work
orloiut Board, as resolutions concerning the
work of individual com mitrees would be better
understood at the time of debate. The default
budget time could be pushed back15r30 mine
utes to accommodate this new arrangement.

Switching probably wouldn't create a giant
bump in interest overnight, While the change
would need to be advertised well. it is more of
a longeterm investment, an additional venue
of communication With students. That said,
it is a fairly painless one that I believe has the
potential to help immensely.
