What is the name of your guys’s
sltow
Chris: East meets western.

Why?
Chris: because I'm astan and I love
country music

What inspired you to do all country
music?

Chris: I actually love country. I didn't
really listen to country until I got here, to
Grinnell, and it just kind of grew on me
and,,. you know, it's kind of a laughrfacs
tot, you know? I'm usually the only asian
guy at a country concert.

So what are some favorite country
artists? Are you guys more new-school
Taylor Swift pop-y country or are you
JoIInny-CasII-Merle-Haggard?

Chris: Personally I’m more of a Brad
Paisely, kind of sarcastic country music.
That’s like my favorite thing. I’d say I
like Big N Richiguys who, like, know
how to party.

Tom: That’s my attitude toot It's all
about those guys that can party.

Well what specifically appeals to you
about country music? I just don’t feel
like that’s something that comes typi-
cally to a lot of people here.

Chris: We are kind oflike the odd—ball,

outsofrplace country music fans if you henest.

How do you decide what music

Any Dolly Parton being played?

think about it.

Tom: I like that it's a little more down»
to-earth, and it’s Just real. This is a lot of
what I hear from my friends that are into
it as well, they express the same feeling
that it's just real. You can just kind of unr
derstand what's going on.

There’s no ‘this is so post-modern or
meta’ [bull]? '

Chris: When I first started listening to
country I was dating a girl from Iowa and
she took me back to her hometown. and
It's just like blue-collar, down»to»carth
people who just like to have a fun time.
A lot of the music really categorizes that.
It’s not just about your dog dying or your
truck dying or you know just bad things
and depressing music. There is a really
fun attitude about it.

you‘re going to play? Is there a lot of
talk?

Chris; As of right now we don't have
many listeners We Just kind of leave it
that like ifl have any feedback knowing
that there are people listening then maybe
we’ll talk a little bit about stuff. I really
want to do trivia and current events and
just fun stuff.

Chris: That's actually the first song
I ever heard, My mom loved Dolly Par-
ton when l was growing up so she played
“Nickels and Dimes.” Really old school
Dolly Parton. That was the first time I
ever listened to country.

Everybody’s really into Jolene. but
9 to 5...
Tom: 9 to Sis Where it’s at. No doubt

Torn: Exactly. It's just straight up and

that‘s Where it’s at.

Hurt Locker delivers tense reflection

BYTORREYMACGREGOR

In 2010, it is tempting, particularly on college campuses
like Grinnell's, to discuss war in abstract terms Not only does
this distant treatment ofwarfare allow for sharper Criticism of
military and, indeed, national policies, but it creates a space
in which one is able con—
sider the ramiﬁcations of
warfare without neces-
sarily considering the in»
dividuals involved. Great
war films work to bridge
this gap, and one of this
weekend's movies, “The
Hurt Locker," brilliantly
portrays the subject mat»
ter of the Iraq War with-
out didacticism or cons
descension, two elements
to which many ﬁlms conr
ccrning military combat
tall prey.

Though director
Kathryn Bigelcw (for—
inerlyMrs,]umes Camera
on) has been making films
for nearly so years, “The
Hurt Locker" is undoubt-
cdly her rntgnum opus. Ir was one otthe most lauded ﬁlms or‘
2009, coming awards from i multitude ofolglinlziinons one
festivalsThc movie recently swcpt the 2010 BAFT awards,
winning best film, director, original screenplay, cdi rig, cine

cmatography and sound, It is expected to be a major contender

at the Academy Awards, where it was nominated for Best Pic»

ture and Director, as well. One of the greatest selling points of

the ﬁlm is the cinematography, and Barry Ackroyd (“United

93," “The Wind That Shakes the Barley") outdoes himself
with his jarringly natur
talistic, nco-renlistic
style.

The camera is per-
petually shaking and
jerking about, which
adds a level of inten-
sity lacking from many
high-budget war films.
Performances from prer
viously unknown actors
reveal the darker sides
of humans at war, in-
cluding a conversation
between two American
soldiers regarding the
possibility of murder-
ing their sergeant. The
film is ﬁlled with these
quieter, deeper fili‘nln‘tk
tions on the nature of
war, and tlicv serve to

centrist nicely with the luglrinreushy shootout scenes.

VVlint really brings this film to the liedd of the nit-It,
though, is ability [0 deftly illustrate what Freud calls “the
Urn-tinny." The theme of rilicliurion runs rilnpunt throughout

the ﬁlm, and the most haunting moments concern themselves
with making the familiar terribly unfamiliar. Rusty “Pepsi"
signs swing from Iraqi doorways amidst firefights, U.s.-niade
Ford sedans are laden with explosives, and the sergeant ma-
neuvers his space-suit-like bomb gear through the post—apoca-
lyptic neighborhoods ofBaghdad. Storywriter MarkBoal, who
worked as a freelance journalist with an American bomb squad
in Iraq, hypes up this sense ofbeing a stranger in a strange land
through his icy dialogue (“What are we shooting at?!" “I don’t
know!"), and his use oflangunge barriers to convey a sense of
estrangement. Characters often communicate through hand
gestures, which highlight both linguistic differences as well
as the painfullyrhuman ability to ﬁnd a common ground for
interaction.

Although some Iraq War veterans have spoken out about
the film’s unsuccessful attempt at accurately portraying life in
combat,“The Hurt Locker" is at once awhiterknuckle thriller
and a rumination on the human side ofmodern warfareTech-
nology. surprisingly, is not always rrcnred kindly, as the three
soldiers tire constantly on the lookout for cellvphone detona-
tors nnd civilians with video cements and ticcess to YouTuhe.
An opening scene thttt features a faulty robot and references
to fantastic representations of modern warfare in vidcogamcs
serve to pull the audience from the comfortable distance at
which they nnghr have previously been considering war.
Though the film may not be a wholly ticcuifite ucrount oflife
on the front lines, its beliiity lies in its Ability to bridge the gaps
