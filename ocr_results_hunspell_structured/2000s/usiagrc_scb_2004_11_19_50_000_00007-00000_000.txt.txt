Las Meninas features studends playing nuns and alterboys playing royalty

BY CID STANDIFER

In a scene of L”: Mmimzr, Noah
Siegler ‘06 stand: in the middle of the
stage, his back to the other actors, arms
thrown in the air while he melodrae
matically fabricates grand plans for the
birth ofthe queen’s (Kat Henry‘os) son.
He turns around, searching for his wife
so he can theatrically kiss her hand. As
soon as he completes the gesture, his
bombastic personality evaporates, re-
placed by that ofa meek boy, shoulders
hunched, hands clasped and head down
as he walks off stage.

This sudden shift from king to al-
tar boy is part of director Tisch Jones’
unusual take on the script. This his
torical play by Lynn Nottage discloses
the aﬂ’nir between Qieen Maria The-
resa and an African dwarfand contains
scenes in a convent and the royal castle.
Rather than switching sets from the
castle to convent, Jones decided to as-
sign all of her actors'
dual personaliries and
make the story into a
play within a play, in
which altar boys and
nuns inside the con,
vent play the parts of
the historical figures

The history ofthe

affair is told from the vantage point of

the queen and dwarf ’s daughter at the
age of 30. Louise was sent away to a
convent directly after her birth and is
now learning about her origins on the
night before she takes hcrvows.

The way Jones has set up the play,
the story itself is told by nuns, altar boys
and a gardener who live in the convent
in the form of a play performed for
Louise. The people living in the com
vent weren't written into the original
script.

While no one has performed the
play in this manner before, Jones said
that this seemed like a natural way to
format it. "As I read the play," she said,
“it became obvious that Louise was
talking to people in the convent."

Kat Henry, who plays the queen,
agreed. “There are lines in [the script]
where now i can’t imagine it not being
done this way,"shc said.

Playinglayercd characters presented
a new challenge for many of the actors.
Most of the actors invented identities
and personal histories for their convent

“We can’t play it tra~
ditionally. We have to
play it intentionally
badly sometimes."

characters, but these stories are only for
the actors' personal reference. ”The aue
dience isn't going to know much about
our ‘real people,' our altar boy selves,
because 1 never speak as an altar boy,”
said Siegler.

However, the personalities of the
characters do affect the way that the ac-
tors play their rolesjarnel Williams ‘07,
who plays the dwarfNabo in the castle
and a gardener in the convent, brings
out a common thread in his roles. “As a
gardener, I'm supposed ro play a subser-
vienr role, and I'm supposed to be angry
about that,“ he said, “and I think that’s
the commonality that the gardener has
with Nabo."

Siegler, on the other hand, created
an altar boy who is essentially the op
posire of the king. “[The altar boy] is
this kind of quiet, shy guy who has a
great time on stage," he said, whereas
the king is showy and arrogant.

Playing ama-
teur actors playing
historical frgnires
drastically changed
the style of acting
involved and forced
the actors to play as
if they were not in
a real, serious play.
“We're making fun of the [characters]"
said Sicgler, “and that’s why rhe quccn
can have a bad Spanish accent and not
worry about it."

Henry is a bit concerned about how
well the audience will understand what
they're doing with their roles. “There's
still a shiver of doubt," she said. “We
can’t play it traditionally. We have to
play it intentionally badly sometimes."

According to Seigler, the play
Wilhlntatplﬂy format is appropriate for
Jones' message about how the histories
of minorities and women have often
been suppressed, Siegler said, “By put»
ting this play in a convent where Motlr
er Superior comes and shuts them up,
it’s Like the queen has been silenced;
Louise has been silenced, everyone in
the convenr is now being silenced...it
just makes it the bigger picture." But by
telling this story, the cast hopes to shed
light on an untold episode of history.
And this weekend, altar boys, nuns and
illegitimate children who were lost to
history will have the chance to tell their
secret story in Lar Mmmrls.

The History

-Louis XIV and Maria Therese ﬁrst
met in June of 1660 on the day they
were married.

OR was most likely Maria Theresa,
and not Marie Antoinette, who uttered
the famous line ”If they have no
bread, let them eat cake!"

IOf the seven children that the king
and queen had together, only one
survived to adulthood.

-King Louis XIV liked to portray
himself as the God of the Sun and was
immortalized in the book The Man in
the lam Mask.

'According to minor, the legends
ary Man in the Iron Mask was in fact
Nabo, who was imprisoned after his
affair with Maria Therese.
