Hockey Night and Tally Hall

Raucous, energetic Hockey
Night returns for yet another
rockin’ Gardner concertithey
might even jump on the speak-
ers -

Hockey Night re
turns to Grinnell this
Friday nighr, marking
their fifth visit in as
many semesters. The.
hint that Concerts Com
mittee has felt obliged to
bring the St. Paul band
to Grinnell cveiy sc-
inestcr for thc pnsr rhrcc
yours is rruly .i [csmmcnr
[0 the band’s excellence.

When opcrung for
Built to Spill in the
spring of '05. Hockey
Night put the aging
indie rock ginnts to
shame. A visit the fol»
lowing semester yielded
a raucous dance party
rlmr brought rhc audience
on smgc for an encore performed Mop speakers. Former Grinnell
student and Sr. Pilul native Todd Pirman labels Hockey Night “the
music rhu will bring peace between wnrring factions in outer space
wirh their lnser guitars."

Hockey Night is a testament to St. Paul's burgeoning indie scene.
The band’s first album. 2002’s Rm Zapping. wns rhc brainchild of
guitarist and bandleader Poul Spinngers and fashioned with the help
ofguitzirist Scott Wells and drummer Alex Achcn from a collection
offoui-trnck demos. .

In 2005. with the addition of second drummer. Adam Harness.
the band saw rhc release of their second album, KM}: Glrcsrr'rz'. Ciira
rcnrly working on thcir third album with upcoming indie inrhem
“Rebel Fever (Who We Are).” Hockey Night will be reruining to
Grinnell with it full lirsentil of new mitteriiil.

While the band boriows from a wide tradition ofiock from clnsv
sic nnd ’805 (0 indie pop. their music is forward-thinking.

spinnger's speak-singing vocnl style is reminiscent or early '905
indie bnnd ancmenr, rhc (Wt) guitars humanize solos. crcnring riffs
that givc hope for rhc ﬁJrurc otnudrblc liiima mi; and the drum
mers drive rhythms with their unrelenting. SIKH'CTl‘CtIVy heroics

Hockey Night's livc shows are more energetic than u pup squad
on Ritalin. nnd they never play the snme show twice. morning they
will keep you guessing even if you have seen any of their previous
four appearances at Gtmnell.

Harkgr Night.

Expect anything and every-
thing from space-suit clad
Mystechs

Don't come to Gardner ronighr expecting opening bond the
Mystcchs ro plny some music ro kick otrrhe nighr.

Thc Mysrcchs. opcning rorTnlly I-Inll nnd Hockey Nighr. deliver
much more thnn music, In ticr. they're hardly music it nil—rhcy're
more like Rarity Horror Pit‘llli‘t’ Show.

The Chicagmbascd hind describes itself in the song “Disco
Hiimmcr"as “halfaway in between retarded and rad." Their nation-
pnckcd performances are known to inciudc spice suits, accordions,
[tumor and it lot ofpokiiig fun or pop culture.

The Mysreclts are uncltissifitible in terms of n genre. is their

songs vary in style from
’SDSastylc syrirli pop. '705
punk. nip and RM}. couna
try. soft ballads and mole.
They lirc nlso known to
switch between gems in
the middle ofn song with-
our Winning.

The band's website
compo-cs rhcir humor ro
that of Ween, Ourkqsr and
Frank znppn. und describes
rhcrn as using humor “is in
excuse to get iiwzty with tivantagiii‘de murder, disguising their nrta
rock experiments tisjokes in order to Snertlt pist listeners’defcnses."

The Mystechs currently consists of Emil Hyde and Nick Dye,
though the members have chnngcd in name unti number throtiglr
out the band’s career which dates back to 1993. They hrive ielcused
seven nlbiims, one every year from 1999 to 2006.

The unique nnd biznne electronicallyrsrlrti'en music ofthe lVIysv
techs is sure to be the foundation for on off—theawnll opening per-
formtinco nr Gmclncr ronighr.

Don't expect ro henr un nmnzing indie-rock bind plny rcnl music
(like what we're used to or Grinnell). but do expect [0 laugh—«either
at them nnd their undisciplined nnrics and wacky appearance, or
with them nnd rhcir nntsc-cubrlc pokes n how nwtui pop music
has become today. 0r both.

The unique and bizarre
electronically/driven music of
the Mysleths is sure to be the
foundation for art ofﬁrheawa/I
opening performance at Gardner
tonight.
