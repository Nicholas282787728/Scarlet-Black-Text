' Pan’sLabyrinth unites childhood, war- -

or COLIN Clint

Guillermo del Tom’s “Pan's Labyrinth" weaves history
and mysticism so ﬂuidly, one could watch the movie twice
without noticing. The "real" world is Spain circa 1947‘, just
after the Spanish CivilWar. The "fantasy"world is centered
around the fUndergrouhd Realm,"a mysterious land from
which Princess Moanna has wandered. These two vefy difr
ferent environments exist as through the eyes ofa charming
little girl named Ofelia (Ivana Banq'uero).

Del Toro masterfully explores Ofelia’s world, the dreams
that fuel her adventurous spirit and the chaotic forces that
throw her existence in jeopardy. Understanding the latter re
quires delToro to explore narrative threads that run beyond
Ofelia’s fanciful perspective, explicitly depicting lhe'brutal
feud between the fascists and the guerilla resistance. But
these gritty scenes only complement Ofelia's narrative and
Del Toro is able to bring the two'stories together in a way
that does them both justice. I

Part of what makes the guerilla rebels‘ plight resonate
so well with Ofelia’s story is the familial warmth that their
interactions'exude. The most compelling ﬁgure in those
scenes is Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), who balances her time
between helping the gucrillas and working as a housekeeper
for the sadistic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez i Ayats), Re-
sponsible for finding the guerillas in his region, Vidal also

happens to be Ofelia’s stepfather,

This “coincidence" allows Del Toro to bring Ofelia gut-
wrenchingly close to the frontlines of the rebellion. It also
puts Mercedes in the position ofhaving to both fight for her
country and strive to keep Ofelia out ofharm's way. Ofelia‘s

_presence amidst the battle between the fascists and rebels

forcefully reminds us ofthe stakes that weigh upon the con—
flict. Both sides are fighting with the future in mind, hoping
to bring their ideals to life via the next generation. Even the
maniacal Vidal muses wistfully about his plan to pass the
family watch on to his first son. ' -

Yet Ofelia remains oblivious to the dreams of her elders.
She has her own future to fight for, one that might seem
naive in comparison with the high—minded visions of the
adults at war. Ofelia is assigned three tasks to complete be-
fore the full moon appears. She is given these tasks by a wry,
gravelrvoiced faun (Doug Jones). He believes Ofelia to be
Princess Moanna reincarnated and promises that complete
ing the tasks will cause her to be reunited with her father.

This assignment may seem a little hackneyed and sche-
matic. In fact, it is safe to say that “Pan's Labyrinth” would
have been a better film if Ofelia's journey through Spain's
magical underbelly had been a little wilder, not pettily di—
vrded into three neat little tasks. But the tasks are envisioned
with such sumptuous detail and horrifying urgency that one

must go to production designer Eugenio Caballero for Pale
Man's house, which consists of an elegantly arched ceiling
and wallpaper that looks suspiciously like skin.

,Credit must also go to Doug Jones, who manages to play
the disgusting Pale Man and the alluring Faun with equal
conﬁdence and verve. His portrayal of the Faun is a master-
piece unto itself. The Faun remains a complex and dynamic
character through the film, capable of winning our sympar
thies with his ability to relate to' Ofelia (who is about a third
his size) and stunning us with erratic bursts ofsavageryThe
Faun is responsible for guiding Ofelia through the mysti-
cal landscape and his unstable behavior reﬂects the complex
immediacy of Ofelia’s narrative. Her experiences may not be
as rough and bloody as those of the grownups around her.
but the challenges she faces are forceful enough to terrify-
ing any adulr.What makes “Pan's Labyrinth” such a singular
experience is the way it demonstrates how such hardships
refine onc's character. As the rebel guerillas fight for a bet
ter future, so does Ofeliaiand all of their convictions are
relentlessly tested in the process.

Playboy comes to '
community theater

When "The Playboy ol‘rhc Western World, "written by fohn/Ml'lll'ngtmi Synge, ﬁrst premiered
injamgary ol’1907, there was so much outrage over its subject matterprotcstofs riored,

This ‘Weekend, 102 years after its premier, director Sandy Moirert and cast are putting the show
at the B. G. Voertman Theatre located in the Community Center on 4th Street. Tickets will be ﬁve
dollars for students, eightforseniors and 510 for adults. The production starts at 7:00pm. Friday
and Saturday witha matinee slated for 2.‘00p.m. on Sunday.

At the beginning or the production protagonist Chrrsry Mahon saunters mm a small town
Irish pub claiming [a the barkeep's daughter, Peegan, that he has killed his own father, with a
gardening spade no less Interest piqued, Peegan decides Mahon is the quality/husband she seeks
and soon tells her father ofher choice. After only a short while Christy manages to become main
interest ofthe towns folk. The, following events (or should I say fallout) violate the logic and mor-
als or‘our modern society just as abrasively as they did at the turn ofrhe 20th centurye though
that does not mean it cannot be funny, it is a satire after all. The audience will surely remember
the production, though [in willing to bet the only (lots will be oﬂaughtcr.
