Slit/m: ean be iound in rhe

horror seenon, If rhere were a
horrible seeriou, wc’d have a new loearion
Stars Slirhus (a radioaenve mud monsrer), a
fat kid, and some 70’: people.

A: i aerually renred rhis my freshman year
wirli vinee Busramanre based solely on rhe
box. irsaid rhere was “No Hell le:S|iihus!”'
well, if rhey are rererriug ro aerually sining
rhroogh rhis movie, rlrey’re eorreer. The ha.
sie premise is Slirhiis is killing people in

veniee, California. we gee a eop rrying ro
srop him. However. plor is inconsequential
ro rhis movie The way ie was shor makes up
for any plor problems. The opening seene
aerually {earures a far kid running hirer a
Frisbee in SLOW MOTION! Can there be
anyrhing moie painful ro wareh rhan some
ehunky kid nlmosr passing our by running
so feer in slow motion?! The next memo.
rable seene is rhe ear scent. Mosr converge
rions in cars lnsi abour 3 minures, Slirhus
out does rhis wirh a ZSeMINUTE CAR
CONVERSATION, The driver honesely
looks like he gers losr, bur doesn'r seem ro
eare. And us nor like rhese rwo people are
diseussing quanrum physies. They're dixcusx»
ing rheir dare (which ended nor 5 minores
ago). iusr painful. Bur rhe besr parr is rhe
mood lighring ior rhe sex scene. This guy
brings his dare bnek ro his houseboar, gers
her a drink, rurns on rhe Barry Wine, and
ilieks on his red lighr. There is honesrly a
red lighr. uniorrunarely, slirhus appears and
bears rhe hell our orrhe woman. Kind oia
mood killer. oh shoor, did I iusr spoil rhe
scene? I'm nor even gonna diseuss Slirhus's
denrh. bur lees iusi say we ger some psyehe.
