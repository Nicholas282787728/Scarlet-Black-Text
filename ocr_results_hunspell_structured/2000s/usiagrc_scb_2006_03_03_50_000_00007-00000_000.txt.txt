Wellness Comittee seeks to
raise awareness of the impor-

Lab rats dic aftcr 23 days without sleep

While Grinnell students may not be going 28
days without sleep, they certainly do not get enough
of it. This semester the Wellness Committee, which
started meeting three years ago and is composed of
students, faculty and staff, has conducted research and
focus grotips on sleep at Grinnell in order to raise
awareness ofand improve campus slccp habits.

Results from a study commissioned by the Srur
dent Affairs office to supplement the college’s bian-
nual Health survey prompted the focus on healthy
sleep habits.

The "Report on Student Stress at Grinnell Colr
loge," conducted by john Schuh and other research-
ers from Iowa State University, sought to identify the
causes of stress, rather than the effects, as previous
surveys such as the Health survey had done.

While the study lacked speciﬁc numbers about the
sleeping patterns on campus, it concluded that sleep
depriwtion was a primary stressor among Grinnell
students and faculty and needed to be addressed.

According to Tom crady, vice president of stu-
dcnt Affairs and co~chair of the Wellness Committee,
the committee's immediate goal is to raise awareness
about the importance of sleep. “What we’re trying
to do is tell people that sleep is important for doing
well on examstor livingabalanccdlifc and for feeling
good about themselves."

College students have long complained of being
overworked and under-rested, a lamcnt that research
has confirmed. Though the daily amount of sleep
recommended for iar24ryearrolds is approximately
nine hours per night, according to the National Sleep
Foundation the average 6011ch students gets less than
seven According to students and taculry, Grinnell is
no exception.

“(Committee members] feel like its just accepted
at Grinnell that you’re not going to get very much
sleep,”]ohanna Borkin'06,a committee member, said.
“As far as people want to be good students, it's as-
sumed that they’re not supposed to get sleep."

The study found that academic achievement and
exceedingly busy schedules are the two main causes
for students’ sleep deprivation, and that an inability
to manage their busy schedules exacerbates the prob‘
lem.

“Although improper time management is the bane
of many students, the problem is deeper,"Dave Wylie,
a-committee member, said in an email to the SQiE.
“Because the problem pits students longrterm health

against their short-term imperative to succeed aca-
demically, the problem is deeply rooted and difficult
to address."

But while they acknowledge that sleep deprivation
as a problem, some students don‘t see an easy solution.
“I feel like at this school, especially. people just need to
learn how to balance work and sleep," Becca Landor
’07 said. “The only thing [that would help] would be
less work, but that‘s not going to change at Grinnell."

Joe Neisser, Philosophy acknowledges that the
workload at Grinnell is challenging, but thinks that
often students fall asleep in class because oftoo much
socializing.

“You have to have a thick skin as a professor be
cause if you take offense at [stu-
dents falling asleep in class],
you're going to spend your whole

message will be lasting and effectual.”

But these messages may ring hollow with students
who don’t see bad sleep habits as a choice.

“I don't think it will help me get more sleep be-
cause I have my priorities with school, despite what
an inventive poster is going to say," David Paige '09
said.

Some research has suggested that late—night cram-
ming sessions that infringe on sleep can be harmful to
academic performance. A 2001 study published in
the College Studentlournal reported that long sleeps
crsithosc who slept nine or more hours a night—
enjoyed GPAs nearly halfa quality point higher than
short sleepers, who get less than six hours a night.

Omar Munoz ’09 said that while
staying up all night may help stu-
dents get work done, it may not be

lifc oﬂ'cndcd," he said. “There is
a difference between the stu~
dents whomake it a habit, and
those who do it occasionally
because they were out partying
late once or twice."

”I feel like at this school, espe-
cially, people yusl need to learn how
to balance work and sleep. The only
thing [that would help] would be
less work, but that’s not going to
change at Grinne/

their best work. “The next day you
try and remember what you wrote
and why you wrote it, but you just
don't," be said. “There’s no expla-
nation for it being there.”

While the Wellness Commits
tee has focused on sleep aware

Education, and a member of
the committee, said that a “sleep
culture" hostile to healthy sleep
habits also contributes to' the problem.
“[It’s] almost where ifyou went to bed bcr
fore two in the morning, that’s kind ofwussy, or you're
not working hard, and if you stayed up later, you're
proud ofit," she said. “Everyone on that committee
has heard, seen, experienced that instead of [stir
dents] saying ‘I need to get my slccp' and being proud
of getting your sleep, we‘re seeing the opposite."
Committee activities have included posting a
number of ﬂyers on campus promoting the impor
tance of sleep, hosting a panel discussion with local
experts yesterday on sleep and distributing sleep fac»
toid cards and earplugs to students mailboxes.
“There's much talk of sleep deprivation on can-r
pus, but little talk of actually doing something about
it,"Wylic said. “The wellness Committees campaign
ofposrers and ear plugs is temporary, burwe hope the

ness and education .this semester,
their plans include examining the
college's role in inﬂuencing sleep
patterns.

“We'd like to think that we’re completely in con-
trol of [our sleeping habits], and to some to degree
that's very empowering,” said waite. “But, unfortu-
nately, that approach ignores a host of other factors.”

According to Waite and other members, the com,
mittcc has composed an informal list of policy sug-
gestions the college may adopt to assist in developing
healthy sleeping habits and generally reducing stress.

Among the suggestions are to start classes at 9
ilJ'n. instead of 8 am. and urging faculty to assign
work over breaks sparingly so that students have time
to recuperate from their strcnuous workloads. The
committee has also considered proposals to incorr
porate wellnessrrelatcd issues into tutorial curricula,
a change also recommended by Schuh and his col-

leagues.
