SILLY NEWS BUT NEWS

Dining halls face tomato shortage;
some students very concerned

About two weeks ago, Grinnell College began to etperience
what some have dubbed the “terrible tomato shortage of two
thousand and four (TTTSOTTAF), orTTT for short,

'I‘TT’s shadow has been felt far beyond the Grinncll came
pus. jeanette Moser, associate director of dining services, said
the issue was "a national producers’conccrn due to severe
weather in the areas that grow tomatoes. Mother Nature is
controlling the ability to get tomatoes of any kind that have any
kind ofquality at all,"

Since August, Florida, one of the nation’s biggest producers
of tomatoes, has been hit with four hurricanes: Charley, Fran-
ces,lvan and Jeanne.

Terry Waltersdorf, assistant director of dining services,
agreed with Moser's appraisal ofrhe situation. He said that, in
addition to the hurricanes that denstated Florida, severe rains
in California and Arizona have been particularly cruel to the
tomato crop.

According to Waltersdorf, Grinnell and the rest of the
nation’s tomato eaters have faced shortages before, but never
one of this magnitude, “I've been in the business for 30 years
and I’ve never seen it this bad," Waltersdorf said-“Everything
worked together to destroy the tomato crop."

Not all students are taking the tomato shortage lightly.
John Guittnr ‘07 said he ﬁrst encountered the distressing news
amidst the constnictioa of a bagel-sandwich, a delicacy he is
famous for. He recalled reaching for the lettuce and seeing with
horror 3 sign that explained T'l'T. He dropped his plate and it
shattered when it hit the ground. His heart, probably of a red—
tomato color, shattered with it, he said.

“Tomatoes serve as a vital component of my sandwiches,"
Guittar said. “Their absence seriously affects my daily meal."
A crowd started to form around the stunned Guittar, he said,
as he clawed at the sign futilely. Needless to say, the quality of
Guittar‘s sandwich was several grades below his usual standard
{or a bagelrsandwich. He longs for the day whenTTTwill be a
bad dream of the past, instead of the nightmare of the present.

New Student group offers photography classes

av CARL FALCON

When Darby was torn down, the campus
community lost its only all—student darkroom.
one group ofeencerned students, the Gtinnell
Photo Society, is trying to increase recognition
of student photography and ensure student
darkroom space. “One of the main purposes
is to create an email list to spread the word
about photography events on campus" says
Keii Campbell ‘05, who founded the society
with Julie Edwards ‘07.

The group is teaching three introductory
classes in photography on Wednesdays in No
vember. The final class will be held on Nov.
23. The group's teachers include Campbell,
Edwards, Serge Giaehet on, David Kennedy
‘06, and Mac Pohanka ‘08.

“In the classes we are teaching kids the
basics in camera mechanics and operation,
including aesthetic as well as technical skills"
said Pohanka. Next semester, the group plans
to offer a semesterrlong class in digital phor
tography, though they do not know yet when
or where these classes will be held.

Students do not need to have a camera to
participate in the current round ofclasses, and
the society is trying to obtain digital camer—
as for students to use for the planned digital
classes.

In this round of student initiative voting,
the Grinnell Photo society is introducing an
initiative asking tor an interim campus dark
room space until the campus center is com,
pleted, The second part of the initiative asks
that a darkroom be returned to the campus
center’s budget. A priority the society has is to
assure the creation of an up to dare and wells
supplied darkroom in the new campus center,
said Campbell.

The group is also planning several other
activities in the coming semester. The society
would like to host at least one lecture next see
mester. At the end of the academic year the
society also wants to host a show of student
photography

They hope to use a Polaroid transfer mar
chine currently in storage which transfers
slides to Polaroids, then to paper. “It comes out
looking kind oflilte a watercolor,”said camp»
bell.

As of now the Photo Society offers stu—
dents the only classes in photography; howev-
er the Art Department plans to offer a digital
photography class within the next two semesr
tctsr “We are trying to create enough interest
to get the school to start offering photography
as an academic program,"said Campbell.
