Jocks: more than Muggles unite to capture the snitch

meets the eye

Cy’s musings on Grinnell athletics

It's no secret that athletes on college campuses are often
thought ofas hard-partying jocks with nothing more to cont
tribute to the campus community than another arrest or Citat
tion for any variety ofobscene offenses (see Picrrc Pierce oftho
University of Iowa). With the exception of the second afore-
mentioned point, the athletic teams of Grinnell succeed in not
falling into the conventional athlete stereotype and in fact fall
far from it.They are unique in that they interact with commu-
nities on and off campus
in ways that are atypical
of what the casual obs
server might expect.

Intense physrcal er
ertion, benevolent come
munity service, and the
debauchery that can only
be called Disco might
not have a lot in common
munless you happen to
have a particularly monumental saturday night, or a particu-
larly disastrous Sunday morriingi but the three are united by
one common bond, Grinnell’s athletic teams,

The teams here some several functions for the athletes
themselves, from ptoiiding an extracurricular activity that
fosters cohesion and skill development among its members
to offering an avenue of competition in a recreational activity,
though these art: only a fcw examples, hut in the grand scheme
oftliings, it's evident that athletes do a lot more,

Take, for example, the amount of community service not
[Ivitles athletic teams have engaged in during past years. Clint
Ics have been periodically offered for Grinncll children that
focus on developing spoit-ielated skills for children from the
city of Grinnell are offered periodically, presenting its partici-
pants with instruction that they might not otherwise be avail-
able, Athletic teams have also assisted with Community Meal,
a weekly program in which volunteers help serve a meal free of
charge for i‘esttlcnts ofcnnneu at Davis Elementary.

The
efforts
put for-
ward by
athletic
t e a m s
a l s o ,
extend
beyond the borders or Grinnell; foi example, the recent three-
vstthree basketball tournament, hosted by the women’s bas-
ketball team to raise money for cedar Rapids, which was hit
incredibly hard by ﬂooding this summer.

That being said, the role of the athletic teams in the
context of the student population is much different, but still
important. Much in the same way that the night ofthe October
10 does, sporting events facilitate connections that strengthen
campus unityThough this is common amongst many colleges.
Grinncll’s small size makes support from fans and fellow atlr
letes alike all the more useful in forming a cohesive student
body. Athletes, more than mccts the face.

Off the field, pool, track, or course, there are a va'ety of
other ways In which athletic teams contribute to thc Gr' ncll
student population as well. SAAC, student Athletic Advisory
Committee, provides a direct link between athletic administra-
tors. faculty, and student athletes to voice their coriceins about
different issues, which often impact much ofthe campus (amt
munity. However, other witleaanging endeavors, like throne
ing sketcth cttniilt‘llytdigniﬁed Harris parties or helping stafr
fitness facr iries are also demonstrative oftlie fact that athletic
teams are not only sport-minded.

Now, I'm not putting the athletic teams on some type of
pedestal or suggesting that they cxhibit any kind of perfection,
butl do think it's clear that they both transcend the image what
some may view as the cliche’ collegiate athlete and do a lot more
some may realize.

So the next time you head to BlockParty after along spring
semester, relax on a Saturday afternoon by watching an athletic
event, or see an athletic team helping in the town community,
hopefully you won‘t cascade into the oblivious mentality on
athletic teams.

They're much more than just a group overtglotiﬁed, empryt
headed reprobates with nothing better to do than to blow the
$40,000 they paid for school competing in a sport. Realize that
the Grinncll athletic teams are a class above most schools'ath-
letics and are a quintessential component of Grinnells student
body that do a lot more for campus than you‘d imagine.

The [~[m1y Par/tirinspirtd sport qiiidditch is coming to the
Grinncll campus. Chiidditch without magic and trying brooms?
Impossible, but truel (hiidditch, sans wizardry, has
come to Grinnell. Last week, enigmatic postt
ers boasted a meeting for the new intramut
ral quidditch club, but they did not answer
the obvious question: how can someone
play quiddltch without ﬂying?

Qiite easily, apparently Qiidditch,

a sport invented by the infamous Harry

Potter author,] K, Rowling, is the pre

rotted game of the four great houses-
(Gryrfindor, Hoffiepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slythetin, for the muggles out there) at

the fictional wizarding school of Huge
warts. In the original version of quidditch
there are seven players on a qiiidditch [cumin
keeper. who tends the three goal hoops at ei-
ther side of the field, three chaseis, who at
tempt to throw a ball called the quaftle into
the goal hoops of the opposing team, two
beatcrs, who try to hit the opposing teams
seekers with a heavy ball called the bludger,
and the all-important seeker, who tries to
catch the golden snitch. All the athletes in
quidditch play atop flying brooms,

Magicless quidditch remains, for the most part,
has to its fictitious ancestor, albeit with a few major
exceptions. Elif Katatas '12, who brought quidditch to
Grinnell, gave more light to the sirbjcc “The keeper tends
three hula hoops mounted on PVC ‘0' ng," she said, “The
tpiaffie is a volleyball, the bludgcrs are nerfbails, and the snitch
is a cross country player."

That being said. the most important integral part onuid-
ditch remains the seeker. “The seeker from each team chases
a cross country player," Karatas said. “The boundaries for the
snitch are all of campus, and being caught ends the game, but
catching the snitch is only worth 50 points, not 150 like in the
books."

Just like in wizard quidditeh, the players are mounted on
brooms, although in the college version of the game, brooms
clearly do not iiy As a result. getting hit by the bludger is not
nearly as threatening as it would be 500 feet in the air, so ad,
ditional rules were added, “If [the bludger] hits you, you have
to drop your broom and simulate time falling through the air
by vsalking around the opposing teams goal post," Karatas
sai ,
Many colleges and universities across the nation al-
ready have similar clubs. “Once we get a solid base and
have regular games, we may join the national league
of over 90 teams.” said Karatas. “The first quidd'itch
world cup is this year," Apparently, quidditch, as a
genuine sport, not only exists, but even flourishes.
The magical appeal ofquidditcli was too much
for lcaritas to ignore, ensuring that she brought
the sport to Grinnell. “I heard about it a year
or so ago," she said. “I saw a newspaper article
about the team in Middlebury.” Although cxe
actly who first came tip with a playable version
of the magical game remains unclear, rumor
alleges that Middlebury was the first col-
lege campus to host intramural quidditch,
which has since grown into a semitvart
sity national sport.

The Grinneil quidditch club, thus
far, maintains a relatively small mem
bership. Currently, there are seven to

eight players for the two most prominent
houses; however, they do have about at)
people in the facebook group.

Most uppcrelassmen, when asked what they thought about
the new qiiidditch club at Griiinell, portrayed general ignor
iance or bafricment regarding the new sport First years, hows
ciier, seemed generally knowlcdgeahle and enthusiastic about
qiiidditch and their new college. “1 hate running, but I'd watch
a quidclitcli game in a second." said Melanie Echalcs ’12, mir~
toiing an opinion held by many of her class, “I've seen the
YouTube videos, and I think the whole situation with the snitch
beirirv a vross cross countrv person is prettv sweet. "
