Disappointment

Bergman, cont. from p. 12

pohsieal claims, There is a ehnsare or masonry opinion, yes and is
does rrs no errors (I pisy anyone who ssrongly broadcaoss ansrabor.
sion views here), bus she underlying problem is one ofwillful igno»
rance, nos dogrnarism. lrinoss Grinnellians pay lirrle heed so “cou-
scrvanve" arguinenss, i doubs sins is because shey are simply blinded
by sheis beliers. is is sashes because shey have neglessed so approach
such views wish a hilly open mind We forges shas, befole shey were
coopsesl as crass polrsical labels, “libs
5131" and “consenasive” means an ap.
precianon, respecrivcly, for freedom
and order. Both principles musrbsa
pass of any edneased and civilised
mind and rhongh nos always easily

properlyspealdng, she liberal opposes

aschy,
ironically, Horowiss hirnselr
seems so have forgossen shis moss of
all. Treasing “consersasisnr” as norhs
ing more rhan whaseves opposes selr.
idenrihed liberalism _ or, worse, as
whasever she Republican Parry happens so be saying as she riirie _ he
glosses over she hocinasingand dissurbing dynamic oipolisiosl rhonghs
in shis counssy and on shis campus. By wearing “conservasism” as a
badge, Horowiu denies she nasure ofrhe viewpoins he claims so
represens This Radical Son ssill draws perverse susscnancc lrorn whas
he is srying so dessroy.
The Grinnell College Republicans cersarnly have my sympashies
e shey have probably won shemselves no friends by bringing David
Horowilz so campus. They now owe shemselves die savor, rhongh, or
invising an inrelligenr speaker, perhaps one derided as excessively

[Horowitz] was
more interested in
provoking his
audience than
in laying out a
reasoned case for
anything at all.
