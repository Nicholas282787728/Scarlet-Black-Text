Emer Grifﬁn(3 3)eats ﬁre (b)

Flirting
with fire

One day during her first semester at Grinnell, Emer
Griffin ’03 returned to her room on James 2nd to a
strange request: ”I just passed a test Eat ﬁre for
me!” One of her floormates, excited at her academic
success, wanted something special.

Griffin doesn't only eat ﬁreishe also can juggle,
walk on stilts, escape from a strait jacket, and perform
the "human blockhead" trick, which involves hammering
a nail “straight back into your sinus passage."

in order to learn her sideshow skills, anfin attended
the San francisco School of circus Arts, the only circus
school on the west coast, one summer, where she took a
course called ”Circus Sideshow 101,”

“I had always been fascinated with circus ans,"
Griffin said. ”I was taking a class in acrobatics, and
there was also this class, which seemed interesting, so I
took [it] too."

Griffin learned from sideshow artists who make their
livings performing at fairs, raves, and other events.
Why eat ﬁre? ”It’s fun to do and it makes people
excited,” Grifﬁn said.

People are often shocked that Griffin can eat fire.
”People are usually intrigued, and they want to know
how to do it," Griffin said.

The “human blotkhead” trick does not meet with the
same admiration. ”It tends to gross people out,"
Grifﬁn said.

To perform the fire—ean'ng trick, Griffin uses a set of
skewers: long, thin pieces of metal with tips made of
kevlar yarn soaked in gasoline. kfter lighting a skewer
on fire, she sticks the end in her mouth, When she
closes her mouth, oxygen is cut off and the fire goes
out, "[There’s] only actual flames for two seconds," she
said.

Griffin has burned her lip performing this trick
before. however, she said her tricks aren’t dangerous
and she makes a point to avoid those which are. "We
learned how to eat glass [in the class], but: don't do

that because its bad for your teeth,” she said. "[And]
Idon’t do fire blasts, because [theyre] kind of

dangerous."

Grifﬁn, a theater major, does feel that her skills will
serve her well in the future. ”I'd love to use Fire in a
performance-art kind of piece or combine it with

dance," she said.

Mike Wells (6) blacksmiths (e)

Sharp skIlls

Mike Wells ’03 went to a cool middle
school. ”When I was in seventh grade!
was like, 'Shit, i want to learn
hlacksmithing.’ Fortunately, his school
had offered such a class in the past, and
successful lobbying by Wells and his
friend; gave the school cause to hire an
instructor for the next year: a man
named Martin Kruse.

Wells, the tall black-bearded junior you
may have seen riding a longboard around
campus, spoke of kruse with reverence.
He characterized him as a ”premier
bladesmith with an exclusive Clientele”
who made all manner of knives, swords,

’and axes for "anyone who really knew
what they wanted in a knife.”

Said Wells, "Martin taught me a lot
about metallurgy and how to hit stuff.”
Wells must have been an apt pupil. When
he was in high school, his grandfather
died, and Wells took over use of his shop.
Soon he was able to work as often as he
liked, and to express his creativity to the
fullest.

”The nice thing about blacksmithing,"
said Wells, ”is you can make your own
tools once you have the basics, like a
hammer. anvil, and a heat Source."

having acquired the basics, Wells threw
himself into all aspects of working with
metal. In addition to forged work, he
also made a chaincmail shirt. This
project did not require hot forging, just
steel wire, pliers, and lots of patience.
”It was basically the result of having no
life,” he said.

since coming to Grinnell, WelLi has
only had the opportunity to work the
forge when he is home on break,

something he regrets. While he can work .

on wooden knife handles and other such
things during the semester, he said, “1
wish Grinnell had more open shop space
people could use." People have talents
and interests, Wells thinks, that
inevitably stagnate because of the Lack of
such resources. There is precedent for
such a thing; even Urban Vale has a wood
shop that is free and open to students on
Saturdays.

When asked what role blatksmithing
will take in his life after Grinnell, Wells
said, ”It will deﬁnitely be a hobby I'll do
for all of my life, [could make money,
but 1 want to put my Grinnell education
to use, even ifa German major isn't the
most promising thing." —-Dave rhenoult

Beth Simons (5) swing dances (f)
Swi n g i n ’ it
reaching, travelling, hopping, competing (and
winning), both leading and following, sometimes
falling, and always dancing, Beth simons '03 knows
' how to swing.

Simons learned to swing dance in high school. "I‘ve
always really loved the ’405,” Simon: said. "When I
was in high school, the [svn'ng] craze hit, and I took

that opportunity to start to swing dancing.”
She has now danced for almost four years.
Upon coming to Grinnell, Simons joined
the Swing Society, a group of dancers who meet
once a week to practice and dance for fun.
Simons and her swrng dance partner, Jonathan
Rathsam ’03, soon became head: of the Swing
Society and started teaching classes. simons has
now run the Swing Society for three years and taught
three semesters of Exco classes on swing dance.

Simons continues to develop her dancing through
teaching. “I’ve continued to grow [by] helping other
people," she said. ”Every time I teach somebody, I
always learn something new."

Simcns has also experimented with choreography,
choreographing a piece that she and her friends
performed at a talent show last year.

Simon: dances lindy hop, the “earliest farm” of
swing dance. ”It’s from the mid-‘30: to mid-'405,” she
said. "It’s the most complicated [form of swing dance],
with eight counts and six counts mixed together."

In early rebruary, ten Grinnell students traveled to
Omaha, Web, for a weekend workshop and swing dance
competition, Simons placed first in this competition,
known specifically as a Jack and Jill competition.

In a Jack and Jill competition, dancers are randomly
placed with different partners and dance with many
different people to many different songs. “[The judges]
pick who they think communicates with their
partner the best," Simon: said. ”It’s not necessarily
about the flashiesl moves [It’s] about working with
your partner."

The opportunity for personal expression attracts
Simons to swing. “There's enough structure [to swing]
so that it's not scary ifyou’re a beginner, but it's not
as structured as ballroom dancing,” she said. ”It’s still
wild and fun and there's lots of room for personal .
expression when you feel ready to do that. it was the
crazy college-kid dance of the ’305 and ‘405."

Simons also likes working with a partner. ”[In
swing], you're working with somebody to figure out
what they‘re telling you to do or to tell them how to do
something, but it’s all supposed to be through your
body, not verbally," she explained. "When you really
click with someone, it’s just the most fun thing."

Professor Paul Bunson (1) juggles and unicycles (d)'

Party tricks, physics style

Physics professor Paul aunson was off-balance Tuesday
afternoon.

It was intentional, though: on a unicycle, Bunson
explained, you’re always off-balance. ”You’re always
catching yourself from falling, sort of correcting.”

Bunson’s unicycle was one of the "toys" he pulled from
a corner in his office for in impromptu demonstration of
his hobby in the Forum courtyard. The other, a pale green

, bag stuffed with clubs, came in handy as he combined
“two feats of coordination for a highcflying pedaling,
iuggling performance.

Eunson began riding the Unitycle and juggling as a
serious hobby while he was a physics graduate student at
the University of Oregon. the University offered all kinds

‘of physical education classes, from gymnastics to juggling
to rock climbing. One day Bunson discovered the school
had a unicycle as well—but no one to teach students how
to ride it.
, So he taught himself. ”Itjust sort of took off on me,”
aunson said.
Bunson's unicycle is a little taller than a bicycle, but they
come in all kinds of sizes, he said. “You can go bigger

r‘ unicycle, smaller unicycle, stranger unicycle,” he said.
”Ones that go backwards when you pedal forwards, ones

. without the seats, Without the pedab

The highest unicycle liunson has ever opted to ride was
six feet tall. "1 usually draw the line there," he said. "If
in not willing to jump off of something that high, I
don't see the need to get on a unicycle that high.”

The higher the unicycle, the easier it is to balance,
though. It’s a matter of physics, aunson explained. Much
like trying to make a yardstick stand up in your hand
instead of a pencil, a tall unicycle is more likely to stay
standing because the rider has more time to react as it
sways back and forth.

here in Grinnell, Bunson can sometimes be seen
practicing on campus or in a parkin town. He’s also part
of the campus juggling club, which meets Sunday
afternoons in harris.

A new development in the cycling world is mountain
unicycling, liunson said, in which the goal is to ride up
and down ”the steepest, weirdest, rockiest thing you can
find.”

rhe juggling motto, Bunson said, is "There’s got to be
a harder way to do this." The magazine in Eunson's bag,
which includes full-color photos of a man riding a
unicycle full-tilt down a volcano, suggests that
unicyclists share that mentality.

"Who knows what people will think of next?”
