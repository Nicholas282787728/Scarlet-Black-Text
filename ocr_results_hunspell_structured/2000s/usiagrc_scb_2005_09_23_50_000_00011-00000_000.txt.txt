Cross Country finishes strong at the Duke

BY BRlAN PERKiX
_ Last Saturday morning, Grilincll
students came out to The Duke in
droves, and not just for Plan B,

The ambiguous paint pert posters
advertising everything from emergency
contr1ception ll‘iClJl'lJIiOH 1nd proctor
ation ‘@ the Duke" were ubiquitous on
campus in the days before the 43rd Les
Duke Invitational cross country mcct.

The promotion drew crowds of
supporters to the Oakland Acres Golf
Course right outside Giinnell College,
to watch the men's 8K and women's 6K
cvents.Snmtdny was a benchmark for
the cross country teams as the Grinnell
women won their home meet for the
rust time in coach Evelyn Frcenun's
26-year tenrrre, and the men placed sees
and behind ninthrranked Waltbutg.

The women's team victory over the
Warthurg squad was a hard-won 32-35.
Samh Spencer ’08 led the women once
again with a first place finish in the 6K
race with a time of23:13, a personal re-
cord. ~

Also ﬁnishing in the top ten were
Erin Booth ’07 in fifth place, Katie Ryan
'07 in sixth and Meredith Groves '08
in_ ninth. The top seven was rounded
out by Allison Louthan '08, Sara Brady

'07 and Erin Sindewuld '08 who placed
15th, 16th and 17th.

Spencer maintained a large lead
throughout the entire race. At the fin—
ish her closest competitor was a full 15
seconds behind her. “During the race
people cheering me on kept telling me
that my teammates were running really
well," Spencer said. “That encouraged
me along even though I was all alone."

conch Freeman emphasized the
successful performance of the team as
a whole. “For the most part the runners

that mn this race last year ran about
45 seconds to a minute faster than last
year," she said.

Freeman is looking forward to next
week’s relatively ﬂat race at the Brist—
man-Lundeen Invite at Augustana,
near Davenport, Iowa. "If we ran good
times this weekend who knows what we
can do next weekend."

On the men's side, Dave Honig '06
placed second after narrowly losing out
to Biehok Deng, a sophomore from
Iowa Centml, in an all—out sprint to the

ﬁnish.

The team's sophomores made a huge
contribution with David Krist placing
seventh, Charlie Knuth placing 12th
and Ewn PalmerrYoung placing 14th.
Seniors Adam Beals and Justin Riley
finished 17th and 27th respectively and
freshman Drake Ballew placed 26th.

Deng, I—Ionig and Riley were out in
front for the entire race, ﬁghting for the
lead until the very end.Tl-ic battle for the
win took a dramatic turn in the last hunt
dred meters when Riley, who had been

sick since Thursday, collapsed due to
complete exhaustion compounded by
illness.

“It hurt a lot. I was overextcnding
myself throughout the whole thing," he
said. “My body just stopped working."

The intensity at the meet followed a
week ofmote light-hearted grillivanting.
Last Friday, the team ran its traditional
campus Loop, which involves bottoms
less men and topless women, much to
the bemtisement of students on their
way home from afternoon classes.

The men's soccer team suffered a diﬁlcult loss last
Saturday against Knox College, which put them back
several paces in their hunt for the conference title, but
the victory against Illinois College on September 18 put
them back on the right track.

The Pioneers were defeated bv Knox College 270

18th and 85th minutes of the game, which turned rough
during the second half. Both sides had injuries during

against Illinois college, some or the players were disap-
