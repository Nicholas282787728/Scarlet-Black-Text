Morning
mourning

A closer look at coping with class

7:15 Shock This is the shortest stage ofcopc
ing _ though it an be the one hardest on the mind
and body one moment you are asleep, dreaming
of life in an intricately detailed candy land, and
the next moment you are thrown into a terrible.
candy-less reality. Your alarm is going oir, your
room is a wreck, you still have one ofyour shoes
on frbm yesterday, and you slept on your three.
ring binder all night. it is during his stage that the
mind uses numbness to cope with the idea that
you must get up and go to class.

7:16 Denial. once the alarm has been shut
on, and once your body has dmlt with the distress
that comes with shock, the second coping mechae
nism sets in. We refuse to believe mat the alarm
has gone off, or that we must attend class. For
example, gratuitous use of the snooze button is
considered an act ordeniai.

7:25 Anger. When you remove the one shoe
that you slept in the night before and throw it
against the wall, shouting disrespectful statements
concerning your professor, your classroom, and
your lite, you may be entering the anger stage.
Anger could also email violent acts towards your
pillow, bedding, or roommate,

7:35 Bargaining. Bargaining is something that
happens between you and God. You promise that
you'll be good for a whole year and even maybe
confess to that murder, if He inst lets you skip this
one class. The second haifofthe bargaining mecha-
nism is dealing with the Devil. common to pre—
erght o'clock class coping, dealing with the devil
can involve selling your soul in exchang: for your
professor "coming into a bit oran accident." You
know, dun’tkill him or anything, but ifyou could
make him immobile...

7:40 Guilt/Sclf-blamlng. You decided to go
to college, You decided not to be a Sociology mac
ior. You signed up for this course. You knew it was
going to be at eight o'clock three times a week,
You knew, and yet you did nothing to prevent it.
No one else is to blame except roryou. In fact, you
are volunteering to pay 28,000 dollars a year to
wake up atseven in the morning and take notes on
Russian history. it is entirely your fault for being
in the present situationThis stage is especially hard
to get through because it is totally true.

7:45 Depression. Thoughts otdraith enter your
mind. The reality hits. You will be spending the
next 50 minutes in a cramped lecture room listens
ing to your classmates barring up reading responses
andsipping on their conecs. You come to the more
terrible realiLation that you will be doing the very
same things.

750 Hope. As you are putting on your coat
and packing up your books, you may begin to think
of remote possibilities _ like that your professor is
in bed with a case ofthc snifrics or eboia oi that
the “test" that appears on the syllabus scheduled
for today is a practical .oke. or that maybe—rust
maybeiyou'll get hir by a truck, crawl into a
nearby snow drift and be preserved in the ice until
hundreds ofyears in the future, when they've get
netically engineered human clones to attend class
for you. Or better yet _ that in the ruture they
have finally forged a classless society

7:55 Acceptance. Finally, otter much struggle,
you accept the fact that you must ﬁce the world
and go to class. Either that, oryou can accept the
fact that there is no way that you can possibly at.
tend dass. Don’t worry about what your proimight
feel about this: I’m sure that, in time, he will be
able to cope with your absence.

And the nominees are...

Joe and Tom guess at the picks for this year’s Academy Awards

Joe Michaels and Tom Robson
Guest Columnists

Another year, anodierawards season. This year
has been both simple and challenging to come up
with a list ofchoices for the Academy Award nomi-
nations, due Feb. 12. On the on: hand, :ach 42(-
egory hasseverai obvious from-runncrs, but on the
other hand each comes with numerous number of
stmgglers. And of course, we can never rule out
the Academy whack-factor that has brought nomi-
nations to the gloriously undeserving Chunk; and
777.: Green Mile in years past and will surely strike
somewhere this year.

Best Picture

This has actually been a decent year for pic-
tures. It's too bad virtually none of those will be
rounded up in this year's ﬁ—
nal five. First, let's dispense
with the obvious choices: A
Benin/iii Mind has been
amassing the awards-season
buzz and is the sort ofhis-
totical fiction the Academy
embraces. Lord aftthfng:
is exactly the sort ofpopu.
list trash that impresses gull.
ible audiences (and Acade
emyvoters) with its epicstuc
piriity. In else Bedroom, in
addition to the lovely Miramax campaigning, has
universal critical support and three oftheyear's best
acting performances, Mon/in Range! may have die
vided audiences but has regained its momentum
with a recent Best Picture for Musical/Comedy at
the Golden Globes. The ﬁfth slot then, is tough to
predict, Will the Academy honor producer Jerry
(the debacle that was Pearl H/zrlwr) Bruckl'lelmsr
for the purposeless Bloc/e Hero/r Dawn? Will
Dreamworks’ strong publicity for Sher/e help it be.
come only the second animated film to be recog.
nized in the night's biggest category? Or will Robe
ert Altman's wellrpcdigreed Garﬂﬂd Perle nab the
Final slot?

Predictions: A BenrrnﬁrtMr‘nd, Lorrie/inciting,
Meir/tn Rouge, In the Bedroom, Goybrd Prrr/r

Should be: Mir/nomnd Dn‘w, Mmmm

Awards

The 74th annual Academy

Best Director

Again, let's dispense with the easiest choices.
Peter Jackson's Lord ofrne Ring: ﬂawlessly dupli-
cate the inspired David Lean epics of yore; the
Academy won't miss the opportunity to reward a
potential heir, Ron Howard could land himself
his ﬁrst nomination wirh A Bmuir'ﬁilMind: like.
wise Mourrn Ranges Baz Luhrmann. industry vet
Robert Altman curries the respect of, well, every.
body; those Golden Globe and AFI awards don't
hurt :ilhcr. The ﬁfth slot comes down to a choice
we hope the Academy is smart enough to make
(David Lynch for the mesmerizing Mrs/halbznd
Drier) and the choice we think the Amdcmy is
dumb enough to make (Ridley Scott for the chase»
convenientlyctimccl military drama Eire/r Haw/r
Down). Please Academy, give yourselves some tied-
ibility.

Predictions: Howard,
Jackson, Altman,
Luhrmann, Scott (ugh!)

Should be: LYNCH !!

Best Actor

Russell Crowe, lastyotr's
victor for Ghdinmr, stands
poised to pick up his third
nomination in as many
years for playing realtlifc
mathematician lohn Forbes
Nash, Jr. in A Brnunfi/Mimi. Dennei Washing-
ton, playing against type in Trrrr'nrng D/Iy, displays
a fantastic intensity that will prove impossible for
the Academy to ignore. Gene Hackman, in his
third film of the year, displays a comic savagery in
The Royal ﬁnenlmrvrne that has already won him a
plethora of awards. Billy Bob Thornton, having
given two strong performances this year {or
Moroterwrrlland T/rcMnn W/Ja Warn? There, stands
a better chance or getting the nod for Brill. And
hey, if Nicole Kidman’s not going to split her vote,
why should we think so ofThornmn? The popu.
lar Will Smith hopes his performance in Ali will
gain him credibility as an actor. Will the Academy
think so? In the Bedmnm’s Tom Wilkinson is a rc-
spected British actor, but the film is seen more as a
triumph ofthe women. But he is british

Predictions: Washington, crowe, Hackman.
Thornton, Smith
Should be: Guy Pearce, Mernenro

Best Actress

Sissy Spacck (In the Bedroom). Done. Oh, no
wait. Therc are four more slots. Hall: Bury and
her two friends (Monarcr‘sBo/A, Nicole Kidman (for
Mouzrn Rouge, not T/rr 02/1!!!) are the easiest
choices. The stunning Naomi Watts (Mu/bplkmd
Drier) is the most deserving, Judi Dench (Ink) is
well respected, Audrey Tautou (Ame/it) is charm»
ingly French (hey, it worked for Juliette Binoche),
and newcomer Tilda Swinton (an Deep End) will
likely compete for the final slots,

Predictions: spacek, Berry, Kidman, Watts,
Swinron

Should be: Tautou (son ofvaguely)

Best Supporting Actor

The first category we agreed instantly on. Ben
Kingsley (Say Btaxt) and Jim Broadbent (Ina) lead
the way, but Sir Ian McKellen (Lord o/rbe Rings),
Steve Buscemi (Greer World) and Hayden
Christensen (Life er (I Home) are all nipping right
at their heals. Possible upset: Jon Voight (Arr).

Predictions: Kingsley, Broadbent, McKellen.
Biscemi, Christensen,

Should be: Eddie Murphy, Shirk, Brad Pitt,
Oreon'sEIerren

Best Supporting Actress

Also known as the Robert Altman category,
Dame Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren will surely
ﬁnd their names in the list ofnominecx for Gas/6rd
Per/c Jennifer Connelly for A Beaver/fezMind and
Marisa Tomei ror In the Bedroom also seem like sure
bets. outlast slot, then, comes down to Cameron
Diaz (Vern/In 54y) or Kate Winslet (Ina).

Predictions: Smith, Mirren, Tomei, Connelly.
Diaz

Should be: Joe’s pick Kristin Scott Thomas
(Cotﬁn‘d Parr); Tom’s pick Gwyneth Paltrow (T17:
Royal TEVIeb/Imm).

She said she wanted to
“make art less formal," and
"less divisions between
