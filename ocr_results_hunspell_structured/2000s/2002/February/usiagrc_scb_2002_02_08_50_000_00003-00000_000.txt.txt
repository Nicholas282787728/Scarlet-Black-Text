"We knew going into the round that our
strategy would almost certainly result in a loss.
But we weren’t doing it for the win, we were
doing it because we wanted to make a
statement about why we debate.”

"We really believe that debate is about
the discourse, not about the results. It's
an educational activity and I would rather
lose for discourse than lose discourse."
