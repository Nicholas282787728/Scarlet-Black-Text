In recent ycaas, the college's growing Black population
had begun racing harassmcnr from members of the sur
rounding community. “we were certified," Thomas said
“We didn'l know from one moment to the next" whether
a Black student might be about to be
shouted at or beaten up.

one day that fall, about so Black
students gathered to formulatc plans
for a student group. "Everyone was
more who could make it.“ Thomas
said. “it was important that everyone
be there, and so they all were,"

The atmosphere was livcly. “like

Thomas recalled, “debating about
whatwc should do and how we should

waldo s. Walker, a professor emeritus who was in the
adaninirrration at the rim, recalled that in the late 1960s.
Black students “began to organize and make their wisho
known about what rhc college should do to help them
adjust to the culture shock or a Black student suddenly
being immersed in this mostly White oollcgc community
in the Midwest."

Disputes hctwocn administrators and Black students
come to a head late in 1970 when students occupied the
library. “1 came to work one morning at about 7:30 and
the doors othurling Library were chained shut," Walker
recalled. Administrative offices were located in the lasso.

After that, “things guicrcd down" for a few months. in

students occupied a room in Burling and began removing

“There are a lot of cultural diffcrcnccs" between those
groups, said Yeboah. who is from Ghana, “we come out or

to got used to the American way ofcduoation.” Many A9

for morc minorities on the faculty.

choah also criticized the wllcge’s financial old system.
saying it doesn't do enough to help international students.
“I ﬁnd it very interesting that Grinnell admitted 21
Ghanians [in veboah's class] and only gave halt tuition,"
he said. “Only seven of us wcrc able to make it here."

1ntcrnational studenrs often have to work long hours
at campus jobs to pay their expenses. “If the college had

“lfyoii're going to help us, help us in totality"

choah said that college admissions materials give a

“Itgivuyou thewrong impres»

Although the us. and

there’s still a lot to do,
