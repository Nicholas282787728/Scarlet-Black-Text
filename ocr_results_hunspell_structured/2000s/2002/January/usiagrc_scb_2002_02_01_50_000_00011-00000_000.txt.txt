With 0.2 seconds remaining in Grinnell's hardrwon
139426 vicrory overvisiring Beloir Jan. zo,crinncll's Ken
Heiser '04 received an inhounds pass, and Beloit forward
Henry Grant went to shake hands with him, only to be
whisrled ror a tool for doing so,

With d-int foul, the two team: (led the NCAArDivi»

record for mosr fie: rhiorvs raken in a game wirli 118.

Thus ended, riniiigly, a wild, hacksﬁiied, back-and
rorrh barrlc rhar wrapped up a srarrmcnr weekend tor the
Pioneer men’s (cum. After heating formidable Ripon 135-
123 one day earlier, Grinnell saw a Zorpoint first-liniflead
go up in smoke against rho Bucs, then came from behind
to dominate down the stretch.

“They played their second game in rwo days on rho
road and came out a little sluggish,” Steve Wood '04 said.
“We took advantage of that and pounced on them. Then
rhry gor rhcir second wind and made a srrong run or us
before tl‘lc half, as good realms will. When we were clown
by {our in the second half, we started to take it to Ihe tack

and draw rouls. Then ir was currains, They just couldn't
guard is"

Wood, rhe Midwest Conference’s leading scorer, fold
lowed up his 5811mm elroiragainsr Ripon by rorelilng the
Bucs for 44 poinrs. Zach Carlson '03 added 26, including
sbr rhrecs, and Hoiscr had 21 plus scvcn assisrs, and all
dcsprre playing the entire second halrwirli tour rouls.

“Ken. Zach and I were able ro expose their swirrhing
manrtorman by rilo'ng ir righr ar mom," Wood said. “lr's
hard to rrop any oriis wirh onr defender, and wirh mosr
defenses determined ro nor ler Nordy [Srovc Nordlund 1041
and Nick [Mallnowski '04] gor air, we were able ro score
emclenrly. Cole [Robcrrson] really gave us a spark on de-
fense and on rho glass "

Still, rhe game was vimially hijacked by oﬁicials rnrr.
Larsen, Randy Massaloro and Mark Grove, who were do
termincd io clamp down on rlrc rough play rhar marked
rhe only minutes ofth: game. As a rcsulr, the rwo reams
shor a combinod 118 had throws, Thirreen players picked
up ar leasr four personals, and ﬁve roiilcd out ofthe game,
Beloit’x Tyson Chapman and thnncli's Roberson were
whisrled ror doublestechniral fouls m the first halrorrhe

game, marking rhe rirsr tlme a Pioneer had received a rech-
nical in seven games.

“The number orrouls called did have some cheer on
us by slowing the pace orplay," Grinncll head coach Dave
Arsaneaulr said. ”This allowed Beloit adequarc time to rcsr
over rho oouisr of rho game, 1 mod ro ger our players ro
adjusr ro rho omeiaring, and l'm sure the Beloir coach did
as well. Neirher orus wiu successrul."

“When you have rwo rcams playing physical and refer»
ccs who like to blow rhc whisrlc, n makes iora slow game,"
Wood said, “This hurrs us, as we are going for a rasr pace
orplay. However, we sroppod up and made our rrec rhrows
down rhe srrerch and rhar may have been the difference in
the game.
