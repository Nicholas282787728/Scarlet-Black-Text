Iraqi Art and Literature

Around the World

You may well have missed the cornucopia of events

which went on this past week. Too bad. However,

there is no reason to not take a spare hour between

classes and visit the Faulconer Gallerys new exhibit. Representing a signiﬁcant

cross»section of the cultural Diaspora visited upon this historically rich country

by Saddam Hussein, the exhibit is a modiﬁcation of one which recently ran in

London. Organized by KayJenkins, Faulconer Curator, and ProfessorSaadi Simawe,

English,- the exhibit runs during normal gallery hours (usually ‘11 am -5 pm,

- check for speciﬁc days) until spring break. Jenkins said, "[This] may be the ﬁrst
time that such’an exhibition'has been shown in the United States"

Assorted Music Department
Events

As usual, these are shrouded in mystery. For
example, this evening the Odd Bar Trio is in
Sebring-Lewis, playing what Music dept.
chair RogerVettercalls "veryinteresting pres
gressivejazz." The Baroque Orchestra of Iowa
concert is Feb. 17. Not only does such a
thing exist, but they are apparently quite
good and feature regional specialists in both
instrumental and vocal performance. Also on
the regional front, the Community Chorus
and College Orchestra collaborates and

The Biannual Dance Concert
Running Apr. 1941, director Jessica Eerson
and compaan second effort this year prom»
ises to be noteworthy. The talent in Dance
Troupe this year, and Berson’s direction, has
already yielded exceptional results in the oc-
casionally enchanting choreography displayed
at the fall Dance recital. The addition of as
yet unknown guest choreographers, and sev»
eral talents abroad last semester, will likely
lend the physical abilities of Dance Troupe a
stronger emphasis. Make a point of seeing
Berson's directorial skills bring the already

extent creative power of Dance Troupe to a
higher level.

”The Government Inspector"

and “Top Girls"

Recovered from the event that was ”Cabaret," the
theatre department returns with more standard fare:
one canonical and one contemporary academic piece.
The former boasts an "internationally renowned" guest
director, Veniarnin Smekhov of Moscow. It runs the
ﬁrst three days of March. "Top Girls” features femi-
nist subversion of gender roles and Emily Trask ’02,
which is all the recommendation anyone can ever ask
for. This one runs the ﬁrst ﬁve days of May.
