ssues orcabiner diversity and the perceprion :1me as an exclusive

"boys club" apperr likely to dominare this ym's campaign for sen

president and vice president, which ﬁnds rhree members or the cur»
rent administration pitted against each orher for the same job.

Though all four presidential and rhrce vice presidential candidates
agreed on do need tor a more rcpmsenrstive student government at an
open fomm held Tuesday night, they dilrered on how to achieve that goal.

Katie Pieper ’03, the current student groups liaison, pointed ro herself
borh es en experienced candidate for president and a potential role model
for women seeking to become involved in SGA. Student Services Coordi-
nator Noe Montez '03 said he would probably nominate five women for
cabinet pose irelccred, while Tony Pham ’03 and Administrative Coordi-
natotAlejandro Cyanabal '04 were more reluctanr to commit to specihc
numbers.

The lack orwomen in SGA has been a point or concern all year or
the eighr cabinet officers appointed last spring by
Paul Ford '02 and Gabe Rosenberg '03, only two
are female; this semester, women hold four out of
23 Senate seats. Most of the andidatu felt that
more women in the cabinet would set the tone for
female senate candidates next year.

Montez blamed the male dominance oFSGA
on the perception that “it's a boys' club end that
we have meaninglco discourse over the wording
ore lor or bylaws."

Though Oyanabal. who made ramdiarirywirh
die SGA constitution into one ofhis main selling
points, objected to Montcz’s dtucriprion orrhe bylaws, he agreed rhet gen.
der representation on SGA Joint Board was a problem, Both Oynrubal
and Phnm. however, expressed a reluctance to force the issue.

"People that went to do Joint Board will do Joint Board," Oyarubal
said,

“I refuse to have any set numbers." Pham said. “I'm not going to be
like, 'You know What? There are no gay Asian Catholic men on campus.
Let's get more orthoser"

Responding to criticism ofhis promise to appoint women to mbinct,
Montez said, “The only way to tor [the problem] immediaroly is ro add
more women on rhe cabinet. There are plenty orcomperenr women who
ere capable etholding those positions, and that’s how you make changes."

proper said met a female president would set a stronger etarnplc than
female cabinet members appointed by a. male orccurive. "There’s a More

the books."

"There are a lot of ad-
vanced projects, but the
idea of a MAP is unofﬁcial.
We need to get that into

Candidates for president and VP/PAA
face off in the first of two open forums

enoe berwoen being a token, being hired by men, and knowing that rhe
opportunity tor upwerd mobiliry and real leadership is a possibility in
sen." she said. “It’s really importanr to have e woman as slender next
year. I am an excellent individual candidate. As an individual, I have a lot
to orrer. As a woman, I have a lor ro oirer the women on this campus,"

Qualifications for ofﬁce

Picper end Montez bring the most SGA experience to the table. Both
served as senators last year before being appointed to their current posi-
tions; as a oandidare for president last yar, Plcpct made it to the ﬁnal
round ofrunoffs before being defeated by Ford. She was also 2 member of
clccrlon board during her rirsr year at Gtinncll.

oyai—rabal, who was a on:»term senaror when he was appointed ad.
minisrrarivc coordinator last spring counts among his achievements in
oirrce reforming voting procedures, initiating the shirt to online voting,
and passing changes to sections orthe scrn oonsrirurion that caused prob
lems last year.

Montez mcently announced that ofﬁcial “loggia hikes” would soon
become available for campus»wldc use. The mmpus bike program had
been discussed for a number ofyaars but never actualizcd. He also mane
tioned his role in leading the alternative break project in Grinncll this fall
as a major beneﬁt to town/gown relations.

Pieper's projects as smdenr groups liaison included spearheading the
Grin. at webvbasecl alternative to the Campus Memo which made in first
appmnm this week. Pieper cited her experience as
ooordinator ofCarrrpus Democrats and her activism
through various other groups as additional qualiﬁca—
tions for the peace orprcsidenr.

While Pham has never served onJoint Board, his
resuman ycaras spokesperson fnrAsianstudcnts
in Allinnoc (ASIA) and two years employed by the
admissions ofﬁckis similarro the experience George
Carroll '02 had when he was elected vice president in
2000. Fharnsau‘d rhat runningASlA gave hrrn execu—
rivc experience, serving asVolunteors In student Ad-
mission (VISA) coordinator taught him how to work
with different groups, and serving on the finance committee gave him
experience representing student interests to the ndrnmlstmtlon.

Platform differences

Montez deﬁned two key issues for his ormpeign in addlrion to in-
creasing SGA diversiry. One orthore was r clarification orthe new alcohol
policy. “Whatwc didn‘t know" last fall, Montez said,“w1sthattheadmina
isrrarion was going to make a lor ofchmges in rhe rules, thing like enforc-
ing a nvoakeg limit at Harris ponies, purring implicit pressure on RLCs to
shutdown loungc parties “1:00 [a.m.], end the problem is that there's no
written legislation governing these rules wharsoever.“

Montez also called for n ampus-wide endit offunds, snying. “It's my
