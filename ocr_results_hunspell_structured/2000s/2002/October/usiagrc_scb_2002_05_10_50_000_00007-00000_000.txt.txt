Got his inch, set to attack

This summer, Tim Kerber will be overseeing a lor or
erossdressing and roek music. His rheorer Company, The
Chocolare Faerory, a non-proﬁt rhearer in Oklahoma Ciry,
has purchased rhe righrs ro perform rhe musioil Hedwig
(”Mike/in” (mi. And Kerber, as rhe theater’s essoeiare
arrisrie direcror, will be dirccring ir.

While working as a reclririoal design and producrion
inrern arYalc the summer hirer hissophomoie year, Kerber
mer Courmey Todd whose husband Miehnel had srarred
The Chocolare Factory. Kerber Wm hired rhereas rhe Roxie
denr Cosrumer and Fronr orHouse Manager lrsrsummer.
“It's an upezndvcoming group," Kerber said, “We’re srilI
rrying ro ger serrled and ger pcrrnanenr funding on rhe
boolo.“

While Kerber heard and admired rhe Hcdwrg
soundnaek over rhe summer, he only saw rhe movie for
rhe hrsr rime when is came ro Harris lasr rail. He was “spelle
bound, urrerly blown away." Since he couldn't buy rhe
soundrmek in Grinnell, he had ro wair unril he gor home,
at whielr poinr he boughr rhe DVD, rhe movie CD and
rhe srage CD.

There had been rolls in The Chocolate Faerory over
me summer abour possibly doing Hiding, securing rhe
riglirs ro Her/iiigwas acruilly nn cosy process ofcnlllng and
expressing an inrciesr and making a deposir. Kerber said.
since nobody else had made a bid, The Chocolire Factory
goi rhe righrs io rhe play.

When rhe company was planning rhis summer's 5n»
ran, some of rho sralirsuggesred rhar Kerber direcr ir. Ar
rhe time, he rhoughr, "Wbar mskes you rhink I should
direcr a musical?" Since rhen. rhough, Kerber has become
more romforrablewirh rhe seripr. And anyway, Kerbersaid,
“I rry ro suck any rime I direer. so rhere shouldn'r be any
problem sucking rhis rims.”

Hedwig, Kcrber said. “ is rhe biggesr ehallenge I’ve ever
seen." First, rhcro ore rhe rechniml difficulries. cosrumiiig
is n big issue and wirh one acror on srage for so long, “he’s
going ro swear a lor." Kerber menrioned his one previous
experieneewieh dmg on rhe srage. “1r was nor a convincing
role ar all. His breascs were rhe size ofhis Face."

The orher big challenge is die ehamerer or Hedwig.
“The eharaerer or Hedwig is so complex in rerrns orhow ir
reekles gender as visually perceived and . . . so a personal
experience," Kerber said. “Warming Hedwrg perform, you
see borh rhe inside and rhe ourside as once."

Hear/ix opens june 13 and plays june 14. ls, 20. 21
and 22

Although anyrhing arrcr Hearing eould seem anti-cli-
mnctlc, Kerber has more exciting plans. In seprember. he
will be going ro rhe Narional Thearre insrirure in Moscow
ro do some independenr snidy iii rhe Moscow Art The.
arre. “I've bccn drmming ofgoing ro Moscow ror maybe a
yea. and a half." Kerber said,
