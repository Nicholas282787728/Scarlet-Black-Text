How to avoid aliens, seduce your mom, and eat yourself

Jeremy: I will begin this week's column with a public
apology For our blind recommendation ofReti Dmgm in
our last column. [are Dmgon is a terrible ﬁlm that upon
viewing will netonlyscar you torlire, butwill likely doom
yourchildren and grandchildren to cmbarmssment on the

J: Wow Brad, we learn a little more about you every

ics.

Signs (PG-13)

Here‘s the pitch: See the faclvgood ﬁtmily movie ofrhe

until crop circles begin to appear in his ﬁelds.

B: This movie is lnctcdjhlyweli done for: studio hlock.

that is. hut is easy to enjoy while it lasts.

Brad’s last gasp: ndpole ends abruptly. At less than so
minutes, it is a delightful diversion, hut reels like a lengthy
TV sitcom.

For Cole, such radio dramas have btcn a lifelong ("7

he :xplaincd. Having gathered a cast ornine from open
auditions held earlier in tlrc semes—

typimlly a weeklong endeavor. “I
generally look totteripts a couple or
weeks in advance." said Cole, con.
tinuing, “I go through and look tor
the characters 1 need and email out
the roles to the actors. I’ll spend a
day or so editing the script, making
it consistent, making copies, and

To “capture the old time feeling" ortraditional radio
