The GRINNELL MAGAZINE, the college's quarterly
publication for past and present Grinnellians, will try to

' cultivate a new "clean, simple look” in its next issue.
Describing related changes, the Office of Communication
and Events, which puB out the magazine, reported that
"staff wanted to tighten and strengthen the copy, include
more student and alumni voices, and make the campus
news section more accessible, more vibrant, and simply
irresistible to the reader." The ofﬁce also hoped that an
increased emphasis on photography will “dramatically
improve” the magazine . . . Facilities Management director
Mark Godar reported that workers are RUSHING TO FINISH
CONSTRUCTION on central campus and ouBide the
Bucksbaum Center before the soil freezes in late October.
Pending agreement from involved labor unions, workers will
he asked to fill Saturday shifts in order to ﬁnish
everything by fall break. Godar said that construction was
essentially on schedule, and that some peripheral tasks had
even been added to the project. . . Grinnell dropped one
slot in U.S. News and World Report’s ANNUAL COLLEGE
RANKINGS last month, from a tie for the country’s
eleventh-ranked liberal arts college into twelfth place,
Grinnell rose sharply in the rankings over the last twenty
years but has never broken the top ten. It also remained
on the magazine’s "best value" list, at number 5, and
narrowly beat Harvard and Swarthmore for ‘10m place in a
new category: schools providing excellent opportunities for
undergraduate research As usual, several elite schools,
such as Reed College and St, John’s College, received
deceptively low rankings after refusing to fill out U.S. News
surveys o . . Grinnell's police department will beginto more

OF ON-CAMPUS PARKING, Morse-Fortier said. At the
moment, he said, about 1800 registered Vehicles share only

Among other suggestions, the committee discussed a

deter students from needlessly bringing vehicles to campus

John Bacino ’05 was elected to serve as CLEVELAND
HALL’S SENATOR in a runoff last Friday. He replaced Matt
Blake '04, who was voted into the ofﬁce against his will at
the beginning of the year. After his election, alake had
attempted to organize a system of rotating representation,
whereby a number of Cleveland students could share Joint
Board duties and committee assignments, but SGA
Administrative Coordinator Liz Allan ’04 rejected the pLan.

removed Blake from office under a seldom-used clause of
SGA’s constitution, which requires the removal of senators
who miss more than two JB meetings, and called a by-
electlon on Wednesday, Oct. 2. There, Badno, who had
served in Blake’s place for several weeks, bed with Blake,
forcing Friday night's runoff and leading to Bacino's
eventual victory. Blake reported that he voted for Bacino
on both Wednesday and Friday, but that friends of his had
voted for him to protest son's dismissal of what they saw
as a more democratic system of representation . . . Vice
President Devan McGranahan ’04 announced the formation
of an AD-HOC COMMITTEE ON SELF-GOVERNANCE to
discuss what he sees as the sorry state of the policy at
Gn'nnell. Among his ideas: a return to the pre71970 practice
of letting SGA issue penalties to students who violate
campus policies, Students, said McGranahan, must take
action to reduce the incidence of problems such as alcohol
abuse, lest selfsgovernance end completely. The new
committee will meet at 1 pm. Sunday in the Forum
Coffeehouse, and an open forum will follow Tuesday at 8 in
the South Lounge . . . Mondays Joint Board approved
funding for an Environmental Action Group project to
construct NOTEBOOKS FROM RECYCLED PAPER scavenged
from bins around campus. Though several senators worried
that the booklets might contain paper that students
wouldn’t want circulated around campus, EAG
representatives said that they wouldn’t use any paper that
contains anyone’s name. The group said that further
notebooks would be made of paper from special "reuse”
bins they hope to place around campus . . . Student
representatives on the trustees' Commitee on Student
Affairs presented the committee last weekend with SGA's
TUITION FREEZE PROPOSAL, which would limit tuition
increases for returning students to a maximum percentage
change per academic year. Representative Patrick Midtlyng
'03 said committee members seemed receptive, but
mentioned possible complications with the transition to
such a policy. The group will continue to explore the issue
in the months to come
