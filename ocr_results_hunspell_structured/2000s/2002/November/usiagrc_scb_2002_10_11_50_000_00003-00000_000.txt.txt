dirﬁrghaﬂ closures

"T'm concerned with a diiterent kind or sustainability," said
John Abramnwitz '05. 'liie're building all oi these new build
ings, and that's great—there's certainly merit to a lot afthemi
but l'm concerned about some oi the things that may be closed
down or changed in the process," he added.

Abramowilz said that Quad dining hall was one oi the most
attractive ports oi campus to him when he visited. He aim
cited that studying in the Forum grill was a tradition For many
students Abramowitc said, "T would like to implore you, and to
plead with you to keep these places open, because while T can
certainly understand the rush for newer and bigger things, there
is something to be said ior what we've grown up with."

Trustee Todd Linden promptly interjected, aslong, "What
year are you?” Abmmowrtc stated that he was a second year
student. ”Then you have no problem, you'll be ﬁne," he said,
laughing.

Tato'ng the matter more seriously, trustee bob tiarr addedr
"betore you get too excited about that, Tthrnk you need to look
at the ptans for the new campus center beiore you get too
upset about losing something, make sure you understand what
you're going to gain."

Henderson gave a more personal response, saying, '1 reel
the same way you do about Main. The absence or something is
very painiul, untilyon see the whole thing the feelings you're
having new are no diiierent irom the ieelings we're haw ng—we
have the same attachments," he said.

Spence and Henderson reminded the audience or their Tone-
ness oi "the barracksLas they used to call the building that
Tormerly stood where the Forum is now. its a student, Spence
said she hated the Forum because it replaced the building her
class was so tond of. She pointed out that it is a matter or
reierence, and that students have loved the Forum ever since a
iew years atter her class graduated.

sustainable design

Eli Zigas 'oo opened the session by expressing his concern ior
more environmentally conscious buildings.

Trustee David white '90 said, "Forthe record, there are a minis
ber oi trustees concerned with that same issue."

Trustee Russ Atterl nearly ended the question by nicely sug-
gesting that that zigas' concern would be best handled by other
people. He said, ”I believe thatthe architects are coming back to
campus soon, and the best idea [Toryou] is to talk with them. Vou
could also talk to [FM Director] Mark Godar.”

Zigas, however, continued the dialogue by putting his goes
tion in a clearer context, saying that there is a ciause about suss
tainable building in the Master Plan. He continued by suggesting
the Leadership ror Energy and Environmentai Design (LEED) (rites
ria. "lots of other colleges around the country are designing builds
ings based on [the LEED] system orpoints certiﬁcation," he said.

Tmstee chair Eamtine little joined the discussion to clarity
the role or the trustees. "T think it's very important to understand
the role at the trustees on campus," she said. "We are very inter.
ested in what goes on on campus, but we're not responsible tor
the operation or the campus, nor do we get involved in a lot of
details about a particular building."

Zigas responded by declaring that his concern was tor more
than just one building. ”WhaLI propose is that all new buildings
will be up to a certain level or certification of certain standards
othenm'se this college will not pursue, to the extent necessary,
a sustainable design," he said, "What we’re asking ior is some
Torm oi commitment that new buildings will be held to this level."

Little responded receptively to the idea. She said, "I think
that is a reasonable request." She added that the students abo
need to consider all or the implications or their proposals, includ-
ing costs, and accentuated, ”I think that you need to be very
concrete [in your request] and make a proposal."

Without much hesitation, Zigas did just that. lie said, "My
proposal is that...the Board or Trustees assert that every new
building built on this campus will be held to bronze levetor above
LEED certiﬁcation."

The board said that it could not make any commitment with.
out knowing exactly what, ior instance, bronze level lEED certiii-
cation was. Little said, "id like to know more about it, what it
involves and hankty that's the role oithe administration, and
it it becomes a larger issue where there is real concern about it, I
suppose we, the board, would be rolling to considerit. but ﬁrst it
needs to go to the administration."

tater in the open forum, Henderson returned to Zigas’ con
cerns, saying, "T guarantee you that there won't be any tnrther
discussions in which your comments aren't going to be considered
by this board what you :aid today will be in the minds oi the
members or this board a year, two years, and three years horn
now, You have communicated, and so you shouldn't think that
you haven't. tron have taught us something new, and it will stay,"

sweatshop
code of conduct

Linda Johnson '05 voiced great concern over the changes
President usgood made to the code or conduct dratted by Stirs
dents Against Sweatshops last year in close conjunction with the
president and the Board oi Trustees.

0n the verge oi tears at times, Johnson was emotional while
expressing her dissatishction in the result or the code that she
and so many others had worked passionately on, including metric
bers oi the board.

Immediatety, little responded with a clear and assertive tone,
“I can assure you that you were not being ignored. Remember,
you guys wanted a code—we are discussing a code. We all put
an ettort into this because we know thatthis is very importantto
you [Studsnis].”

Trustee Steve Hotta added, "The process isn't over, so hang in
there."

campus center

One student raised concerns over the size or the campus
center. "one or my concerns is whether the campus center is
going to be this huge shopping mall atmosphere, and I think that
you have the responsibility as you are looking at these plans to
realize what our particular concerns are," she said. "We don't
want Darby to go, we don't want the Forum to go," she added.

Little responded thatwhen the board switched from the origi-
nal to the current architects working on the campus center it
was exactly rorthat reason—the tear that it would be too mas»
sive under the original architect's designs. She said, “It’s some
thing that we care about very deeply too. We're not going to be
here in so years, but we want to make sure [it is] in harmony
with the rest of campus."

Trustee Anne Spencer said that she was abo very concerned
about the appearance and size or the campus center. However
her opinion had just changed earlier iriday, when the architects
presented the latest design piarls to the board in the morning.
She said, "Shopping matt? —iiieie‘s no way. T just loved it,"

She added, "This is [part otthe] ongoing process or the eve»
tution oi Grinnelt college like all other evolutionary processes,
it will sometimes be good, it will sometimes be not as good as we
want, and it will sometimes hurt,”
