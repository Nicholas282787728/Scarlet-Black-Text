stellar, slcaay iritman (Jude Law) so kill tiie Collirises.

J- Tire only tiring slras could possibly be moie buaulie
ﬁil than seeing Tom Hanks and Paul Newman on screen
sogerlrer is Conrad Hall’s cinematography. With sire grainy,
snowy. rainy sets and superia art direction, Rom! so Fwy/r

sire only tiring you care

B: in addition to sire
film's stunning visuals, sire
acting is luminescent. Tom
Hanks could coast for trre
next 20 years playing a lovable guy tirat succeeds in tire
end, a role he perfected in Forrest crimp Here, ire shatters
iris ssereosype, convrneingly portraying a common tlrug
trying so save iris son. Similarly, Jude Law, with his periees,
Godgrven looks, seems missast as a treacherous, lsalding,
assassin. Once all she makeup is on him, snougir, ire oozes
tire ﬁlm and vice tiras complete in eiraraescr. And Paul
Newman is good ol‘ewart, i mean OLD, Paul Newman.

Jeremy Makes His Peace: Here it is, guns ablaain', tire
