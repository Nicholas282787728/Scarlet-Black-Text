BOOKS

Josh Weiland: rirrianes by Borges

lindsey Kuper. The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson. ir you're the kind or person
(like me) who usually can't stand "science ﬁction," this is one Stirﬁ book you’ll
love. It's hilanous, sophisticated, creative, sexy, poignant and piolound.

laura rrantz: For the ultimate varation, immerse yourselt in a quality children’s
rantasy senes; Lloyd Alexander (The Black rouldron), susan Cooper (The Dark is
Rising), ilobin McKinley (the hero and the frown), ts. terns (Narnia), will.
Tolkien (lord of the Rings), Monica rurlong (Wise fhild), J.l<. Rowling (Harry
Potter), Madeleine L'tngie (A Wrinkle in Time), and thula LeGuin (The Wizard of
ranhsea) have written some extraordinary novels ror people or all ages. Check the
whole series out him the library, look yourselrin your room unth popcorn and hot
chocolate, and don‘t emerge untilgood has triumphed over evil.

[oliri Seiler: Our Band [ould be Your life by Michael Azeirad, If you like iotk and
roll, you'll dig this, as the book tells the story of 13 bands from the underground
rock Stene of the 805, The fact that the author could get all these major indie rock
players to talk and tell their stories is incredible enough.

Jillian Eoly: There's a really good book called Longitude by Deva Sobel. It's all about
the English watrhniaket who ﬁgured out how to make a watch that would work on
boats, in that ship captains could compare the local time with the time of the
place they left and from there ﬁgure out what their longitude was. Up until then;
there were lots of boats ramming into land without realizing it was there, and that
led to many dead folk.

Annie deamon: k Heartbreaking Work of staggering Genius by Dave Eggeis
Elizaoeth Hirw' catcher in the Rye is classic. Don’t leave home without it.
Soumbli Samﬁ Sammy Seal (t read it when 1 was 4).

Amanda Hodgrrmn: Winter break calls Tor lots of Kurt Vonnegut.

Nona UfaxurAppioh' The [oldest Winter Ever by Sistah Souljah and [aptur'n lorelli's
Mandolin lay Louis de Bernieres

Vanessa Gennoreli: Written on the Body by Jeanette Winterson, A heartbreaking
Work of staggering senius by Dave Eggers and {rash J.G. Dallard

MUSIC

llz Jarvis: DlXiL‘ Chicks latest album, Home. It's fantastic.

Elisa Mcaal.‘ Cat PoweriThe Covers Record, Gillian Welchi Time, the Revelator
and The Mountain GoaisA Tallahasse

[aliri Seiler: Mctusky's new album Mclusky Do Dallas is straight—up noisy and
obnoxious rock and roll kind or like the Rxles meeting the Jesus Lizard. They have
a hilarious way of combining insults with totally unrelated lines in their lyncs and
some or the song titles are worth the pnce alone. The album manages to be noisy
and abrasive while still retaining some sen‘ous hooks.

Sarah Cornwall: Cursive's Domestica
Julio Edwin: 0 Brother Where Art Thou Sunndtmk

Jillian raly: Sleater.l<inneys ane Beat and Aloha's Sugar (because i want them ror
Chn'stmas)
