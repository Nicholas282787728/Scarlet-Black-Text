Dire consequences of procrastination

People have been ﬁghting over the bit orland ohrhe
eastern coast orrhe Mediterranean today known as lsrael
roe rhe better part or thousands eryears, and for most or
that eirne, that ﬁghting has certainly been horrific. but in
the past week or so, the situation has gained an adverb.
devolving ro absurdly horrihc in the rash orsuierde bomb»
rngs and tank rnvasions rneo rhe west Bank.

The lS-monrheold Palestinian ineiradeh has
succeeded in producing a 3:1 Palestinians killed
to lsraelis killed ratio, a victory by the reckoning
otrhe radical Palestinians (by ennerasr, in die 1937
rntiradeh, the ratio was 25:1) but a loss for their
more rnoderare brethren and for hurnaniry in
general. in thatse much blood must be
spilt torso lirrle purpose. Ariel Sharon's
method or reialiarion_nrovrng tanks
and troops in a full-scale invasion ofl’ale
estinian rerrirory_rgnores the harsh re.
aliey thar such a military action will spur the Palestinians
to be even more radical. And Yassir Ararat seems to be in
potent, a mid—March prenouncernent about the hrtiliey or
suicide bombing nor stepping ehe wave or killing since
rhen.

And where has the us, been during all ofrhis chaos?
Until very recently, President Bush’s omeial stance has
been re srand above the tray, since oreourse unrest on
the other srde orrhe werld cane actually affect .. wair a
minute.

Whatever the reason that bush hnally rnade rhe con.
neerien, he has, at last, sent Colin Powell to discuss a
peace with Ararat and Sharon. To his credir, Bush's
“enough is enough" speech actually recognizes the race
that Israeli and Palestinian authoriries are been some.
hew in the wrong. Net to his credit is rhe race that the
speech should have been made 15 rnenrhs ago, as the
younger Bush aeceded to the oval omce and before

notes from the underground

the inrifadch had gotten as bloody as it has new.

Had Bush decided that isolationrsrn was bad For the
country in this regard rather rhan having it decided for
him sept. ll, he may have been able to stop the bleeding
in this region betere rnaerers got to a point beyond con»
rrol, Obviously there is no way ofrclllng ir5haren or Ararat

would have acceded to any Bush-mediated cornproe
raise—Sharon is notoriously hawkish, and Arafat rce
ieered Ehud Barak's extremely generous zooo oﬂeri
but they certainly would have been more open to it
than they will be now.
Ferry—three people were killed by suicide bomb-
ers during the {our days between March 27 and
March 31 alone, plus
more since then
that l don‘t have
specrrie numbers
for, Meznwhlle, the
lsraeli army has mobilized troops and called In reserves to
atrack a number eresscneially eivilian settlements. vowing
not to pullout until dreir job is done: lebanon, in return,
has mobilized ro arrny at ehe border to stave onany poeene
rial lsraelr strikes, Such actions scream “underhox,” and do
not suggest that an easy solution is roreheorning.

As I write this, I am reading a news release that reports
Sharon's assertion diaeror Powell to talk re Ararat is a “tragic
misrake" and that he will no longerdo business with Arafat,
calling him the leader ora “regime of terror," Such serong
words and characrcrluuons make me wonder how exactly
Powell rs going to negotiate a peace in a situation where
the two parties no longer even recognize each oeher.

Bush seerns to have taken a rypieally Fri-st World ape
preach to the srtnation in the Middle Last: ignore the prob
lem in (he hopes that it goes away or mud the ice cap
rnelts and New York City is underwater, The spar orvie.
lenee in the region suggests that the larrer point has been

reached, and whrlel arn heperul that sorne kind ordiplo.
rnarrc arrangcmcnrgor at lease a cease ﬁreican be
reached, I arn beginning to suspect that the actual srtua.
tion is more akin to the ioe cap Scenario: you tune re freeze
it once its gone.

The artrcle in rhcApnl ls, 2002 nmernageaine horn
which 1 have taken much of my information is trtled “Be-re
ter Late than Never," and yerl am beginning ro drink that
this cliche may not actually be ehe case, Rather than being
proactive and
re lease
achieving a
ceasefire, as
rhcnel’rcsi»

did in was.
Bush has all
but ignored
the situation
for so long
that he was
beaten to

Arabia Thar Fahds proposal, which would have lsracl re.
turning to 19o7 boundaries, would make the state near.
indefensible Is nor the porne- the point is rhar he did it
ﬁrst.

By warring to take direct action until now Bush may
have single handedly assured that the conﬂict has escalated
to a point where re cannot be solved by diplornaric r-neans,
despite rho seared desire by all panics involved for re to be
so solvedThough 1 do hope that Powell and Bush can do
sornerhing in the region, with the current insrabrliey une
likely to rnrprove 1 rear Bush’s incursion may be a case or
too lirrlc, too late,

Bush seems to have taken
a typically First World
approach to the situation
in the Middle East: ignore
the problem in the hopes
that it goes away.

These won’t be melting in my mouth

Iconsider the recent decision to include pastel MEMs
in the regular season product a travesty on the part of
the M&M/Mars candy corporation I realize that the
company is conducting a nationwide consumer polland
intends to narrow the pastel fare to just a few of the
pastel colors, however, I am adamant about the idea
that any number of pastel MErMs, no matter how small,
is too many.

In the past, particularly at parties, I have looked
towards the M&M bowl to provide me with a striking
array of bold and distinct primary and secondary colors
(brown being permissableas a combination of the other
colors) The presence of pastel colors interspersed among
the traditional colors nlars the appeal of the candy in
general and above all. makes me feel quite unsettled.
Please, Voice your opinions against pastel M&Ms.

Free the Lucky Charms

I don’t ask for much. I don’t need ﬂavor or variety,
I do n’t care about fresh fruits and vegetables—in fact,
I don't care about vegetables at all! I'm okay with
Coca-Cola, I think Quad is cozy, not crowded, and I
really don’t need to eat from a bowl. Pork lard in the
beans? I shrug! The occasional hair in any variety of
potatoes or plastic in the desserts doesn’t put me on
at all. AllI ask for are Lucky Charms and peanut but-
ter. Lucky Charms, not green fruit loops with marsh-
mallows! Quad's Lucky Charms have been held hos-
tage in the kitchen as of late, and my health is in
serious perilr I am hanging above the sharp rocks of
certain death due to a diet consisting purely of pea-
nut butter, and as only the blessed few can save the
soulless and only FIP can save the trees, only Dick
Williams or those willing to rise in rebellion against
him and free the Lucky Charms can save me. Please,
