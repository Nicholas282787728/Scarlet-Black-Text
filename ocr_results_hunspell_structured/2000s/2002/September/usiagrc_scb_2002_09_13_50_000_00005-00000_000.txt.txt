Results from the complaint against Ford remain unknown

Hearing Board, cont. from p. 3

Srudenr Aeriviries Dirceror Sheree Andrews, rhc college’s sexual
assaulr coordinaror, adyised rhar rhe college communiry should ac.
knowledge the concerns ofstudents and laculry and acr on rhcm.
Though she said she could nor ccmrnenr on Ford’s case specirnsily,
Andrews said, “we need to rrusr rhc process and conrinue ro ques-
[lon rhe proeus because rherc is always room for improvemcnr.”

Lessons for the campus community

Fords faculty advisor in rhc proceedings, l<arya Gibel Azouiay,
Anthropology and Afticnna Studies, said she could not comment on
rhe case irselr. bur suggesred broad lessons could be learned rrom
whar occured. “Srudcnrs have sroppcd raking responsiblllry for rheir
acrrons," Gibcl Azoulay said “To be gnphie and frank, lfsomconc
willingly decides ro gcr in bed wirh somebody else, I personally am
nor going ro be symparherie ro complainrs on rhe consequences of
that action."

She also poinred our rhar personal assumprions abour behavior
and idcnriry can bc misleading and cause people ro associaro harasse
menr wirh idenriry. shc said rhar ir is rob easy ro aceepr accusarions
which are rounded on sroreorypes abour rhe acrions or inrenrions of
others. “It becomes even more tricky when, on the surface, there
seems ro be an imbalance of power.. because so orren rirere really
are imbalances bur ro auromarically assume rhar a taller person, a
iarrer person, a male, a New Yorlrcr.. is rhc culprir is simply disin-
genuous," Gibel Aaoulay said. “[fthctc are people from the Midwesr
who have been isolared from rhe changing world. .. rhey are going ro
have to get accustomed to different oolois and diﬁ’ctciit (out: and

dirrcrcnr ways oiongaging and nor, because rhcy are rhe majority. , ..
immediarcly rransiare ir as aggressive, offensive, behavior."

The case also broughr up issues olselrgoycrnanee, and accord.
ing ro Ford, rhe srudenr body's abiliry ro scr responsrbiy and respec.
riyely. “smdenrs need to undersranrl rcspecr," said Ford. ”Students
should rcspecr everybodys righr ro be on rhis campus and respecr
people's qualiry orlrre.“

one of rhe complainanrs had her own reuons for frusrrarion.
College policy dicrares that rhc resnlrs orsuch uses nor be made
public. hyen irrespondcnrs are round in violarion, rhesrudenr body
newt hears or any consequences.

This lack orpubirc knowledge abour rhc case’s resulrs, rhe come
piarnanr said, had made her doubr rhe useruincss or bringing her
charges in rho ﬁrst place.

“I felt n was all for noming," she said. “I was heard, bur l reh—
nor chastisedibut rhe racr l broughr ir up was ridiculous. This
summer I focused on whorl had done wrong.”

“No one acrually knows whar happened" said Zichnr the senaror
who had ﬁrst heard rhe complainrs “Mosr people assumed rhere
would be no acrion ralren."

SGA Lessons

Some m rhe adminisrrarion were posirive abour rhe complcrion
ofa dilhculr process,

According ro Thomas, rhe sysrern worked, rhough he questioned
rhe appropriarencss of rho acrions and sranoes mlren by members of
SGA and orhcr campus groups. According ro Thomas. SGA wanred
ro hayc rhe prrsrcienr gone, and rhey gor whar rhcy wanred. Persone

ally, he heiieyes rhar rhey acred roo hasrily and wirhour due process.

"SGA had no procedures to do whar rhcy did," he said. “lr was a
confusing siruanon ior campus."

Neverthelcss,Thom:issees rheearnpus mower-prepared ro handle
problems in rhe rurure. “SGA is in a srronger posirion roday because
ofwhat rhey had ro do," he said. “SGA recognized char rhere was a
framework and rhings rhey could do. "

Two ofthc members ofSGA who were on rhe commirree rhar
approached Faui remain conﬁdent char rhey did rhe righr rhing.

“I srand by rhe decision ro confront pnuls' said Zieha. “My expe-
rlcnci: on campus is rhar if it had gone public as procedure would
enraii, ir would have been a lynching. . .. The members orscA were
rrying ro give him an our, gracefully. SGA was doing him a favor, , ..
we did rhe righr rhing and people should be happy abour that."

According ro Rosenberg. in order ro remain a voice {or srudene,
SGA had ro :ch He said, “SGA needs ro be open and available and
accessible; a place people can rake rheir complainrs "

As for Ford, he felt rhar cerrain individuals should have remained
unlnvolvcd. “[Them was] av.F. and [rhere was] a senarorwho should
nor have been involved in me process," he said. “[The SGA sllutl»
rion] was unfair ro me and ir didn'r need ro be done rhar way." He
also said rhar, in rerrospeer, he would have nor resigned under rhe
same condmons.

Ford said, “My lerrer was an apology—I would luv: expressed
rhar [rho siruarion] was being dealr wirh. [1 resigned because] it
was in rhe bcsr inreresr of rhe public."
