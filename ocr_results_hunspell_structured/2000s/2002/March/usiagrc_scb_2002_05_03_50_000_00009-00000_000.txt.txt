students speak out
about what‘s on
their minds in 142
words, and you’re
invited! If you have
a random rant, email
it tn me at
alward@grinnell,2dui
After all, complain-
ing in apublic forum
is always more fun
than doi git alone.

Don’t we love to complain?

What‘s going on here, people? There is obviously
something very wrong when our dear, beloved 5&5 has to
solicit students to write random rants! After all, we‘re not
just any students, we're Grinnellians; we love to complain!
(Arid overuse semicolons, but that's another issue
altogethen) Vou argue more than enough in all of my classes
and i know for a fact that you‘ve been fighting over who

shot who firsl during assassination. Not to mention the,

fact thamt the dining hall served meatloaf for dinner Last
night and the cold water at Quad is still inexplicably warm.
And so I urge you, fellow students, don‘t just bitch out
loud, write it down and have it printed, Infuriate the
masses!

Unhappy when the weather’s crappy

As the semester humbles and thuds toward its inevitably
exhausting conclusion, I cannot help but look heavenward
and try to resist pleading with the Almightyls) to put me
out of my miseryi However, every time I venture outside
and squint into the light of day, I see ugly things staring
back. Dark, lurking clouds reminiscent of those papers due
Monday and Thursday of ﬁnals week. Irritating, stubborn
rain, evocative of those history readings I skipped in, uh,
early February. Tempestucus winds suggestive of the
semester's emotional drama threatening to whip itselfinto
a veritable melodramatic hurricane, It appears that the
weather is thwarting my attempts toenjoy the last weeks
of the semester by adopting my end-of-the-semester mood
and spitting it back at me. Sorry everybody Ill try to be in
a better mood. It's just that the weather ls so cmppy.

Who the hell is Madame Grinnell?

This random rant is in response to the rant of”Johnny
Student” in the April 26 paper. In his rant he denounces
Titular Head and Grinnell in general by Stating “Madame
Grinnell is menstruating prteously allover the ground.”
I was disgusted and annoyed that you would use the
image of menstruation in order to represent something
as appalling and pitiful. Women do not menstruate
pileously. Menstruation is a wonderful and important
life functions Vour use of a female character to signify
Grinnell College is aLso degrading and chauvinistic. Next
time‘ that you have sin-anonymous complaint about
Grinnell Student life, please find a metaphor that does
not demean female bodily processes and that actually
makes sense. .
