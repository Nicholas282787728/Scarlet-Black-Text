Ford chooses to resign rather than
face impeachment proceedings

Ford, cont. from p. 1

quickly, “I did not have the chance to try so get cabinet
sogesher so inoer with them,” he said.

He described Rosenberg and the others as “set in dreir
opinions" and said shas “die people in the meeting were
conducsing themselves in such a way thas is became very
clear to me that they were nos interested in my concerns or
my claims."

Rosenberg counsorcd, “we did lissen to what he said,
and l tried to listen erislmily to what he had to say, and
move on and be constructive from there."

“cabinet would nos allow
Gabe to speak for shcm until we
heard his side," Zicha said. “i U
shoughs shas was fair."

Zieha said Ford had agreed
that impeachment would likely
result ifshe accusations had been
made public. “Paul is very lucky
shas he got she opsion to resign,"
he said. “He is not a victim. He
made the choice to resign."

The letters that Zicha pree-
sensed to cabines concerned two
speciﬁc incidents: one which oc«
curred oft-campus lass spring, and
one which happened in Ford's or.
nse on Apttl 16. zisha also said
he knew oras lesss two osher in-
dividuals who had concerns bus
did not register complaints with
eabines.

The individual whose complains concerned evenss last
spring declined to talk in detail about her accusations. “I
was both verbally and physically insimidased into sexual
situations 1 did not want so be in," she said in a bricfwrirr
seir ssasemens. “I expressed my rear and desire to be re
moved from she situation with both my verbal and physi.
cal resistance."

Ford had no comment on shose specific ssasemeno,
but did speak broadly about she allegations in an earlier
interview. “I did nos sexually assauls anyone," he said.

"From my own recollection, there was some behavior
on my pars, physical behavior shas was inappropriase,"
Ford said. “I have never said or tried so say to anyone shat
I did not do anything there and that my conduct was A-
OK 1 have never defended shat. l have always been very
upetsont in admitting that some otmy behavior was inap-
proprintc,"

Although he did not go into details, Ford said he one
agreed with “others who are speaking about" she degree of
liiaipproprluterress.

Ford said he was insoxicasod as she time, though he

“l stood up from sire chair [and] moved sowards the

from behind me, with his arm srresehed over my shoulder
and his hand pushing the door dosed before I could open
she door wide enough to leave she situation,"

She then went towards the window so open she blinds.
she wrose, “affirming mydisapproval and desire not to play

blinds, “physically urging me so comply."

Ford said shat thessudenss initial reaction was in keep.

“What is imporsans is so understand that her reacsions,

he said,

The complainant asked Zieharo question wherher Ford
could continue to serve as president.

“I tear that Paul is abusing his SGA ofﬁce for personal

In she case or the incident last spring, Zicha added,

events of last weekend,

The mayor isern of business right now is pussrng sogesher program»
ming for she board oftrusrccs’ vrsis so campus next weekend, Rosenberg
said. Ford was originally slated to sit in on the meeting oFthc full board,
but Rosenberg will sake his place. The two of them were supposed so
deliver a presensasron so the boardon the current ssaseofssudens opinion.
Student Groups Liaison Katie Pieper ‘03 will join Rosenberg for that pre—
sensation.

"we are going to continue salking so shcm abous financial aid and the
concept ofthe tuition guarantee," he said “i think we've made tremen-
dous headway over she course otshe semoser in srying so bring so she
forefront the economic hardship: that many ofour students face."

Rosenberg said much ofthc work still to come on the tuition issue will
have so be done nexs year by l>rcsidens.elecs Alejandro Oyaraabai ‘04 and
Vic: Prsidcnt-clcct Devan McGranahnn ‘04.

“We’ve laid the groundwork," he said. "but Alejandro and Devan are

change. "

Apart from she upcoming trustee visis, Rosenbergsaid she main issues

facing SGA in the nexs two weeks will be she proposed merger ofNotthe
em and Southern Espress and she possibility ofiosing three public come

SSA who share this concern, about she closing of computer labs,"
Rosenberg said, “The computer labs are a resource that students depend
on to get their academic work clone, They also serve as community focal
points.

Although Rosenberg is now president ofSGA. he maintains his previ-

him to appoint a vice president so carry our she duties of representing
cabines, bus Rosenberg said he is unlikely to do so. '

anything in two weeks."

Rosenberg also said he didn't want so unduly disrups cabinet chemis—
try. “When l’m really depending on cabines, it's really important that we
ssisk together as a unit," he said.

in Joins Board. Thar role is being filled by Films chair Hilary Bown ‘02,

stances surrounding Ford’s resignation, butsaid he had met wish Rosenberg

Behind the
sexual
misconduct

policy

Grinnellﬁollege’s sexual
misconduct policy came out
of a series of tammittee
discussions over the course
oi two years,

in the process of
reporting sexual miscon—
duct, many decisions are
left up to the plaintiff. ”The
outcome [oi accusations]
depends on what the victim
menses," said Andrews.

However, Andrews said
if the college notices a
pattern or sexual miscon<
duct on the part or a
perpetrator, they may
intervene.

Andrews Called the
sexual misconduct polity
”very just and hair for both
the victim and perpetrator.”

Students who think
they may have been a
victim of sexual misconduct
can speak to an RLC,
chaplain, any member of
the Student Affairs staff, or
a DVA/SAC advocate.

Student Affairs

employees must report any ,

mine which could endanger

the campus community to

the police. Short and

Associate Chaplain Deborah

Erin are exempt from this

policy.

Sexual misconduct as
deﬁned by Grinnell College's
polity includes, but is not
limited to:

- Nanrconsensual sexual
intercourse or attempted
sexual intercourse

. Nonscnnsensual sexual
contact or attempted
Sexual Contact

- Sexual exploitation

- Sexual hamssnrent

According to the
Student Handbook, if a
student ﬁles a complaint
about sexual misconduct,
the case will be handled by
the Grinnell College hearing
Board. the hearing board is
appointed by college
President Russell Osgood
and consists of a rotating
panel of administrators
trained in judicial
procedures.

The hearing board
reports its findings to Tom
Crady, vice president of
student servites, who is in
charge of deciding what
punitive measures will be
taken if the attused is
found guilty. ciady has 10
days to issue a decision.

Both parties involved
have the right to appeal
any decision to Osgood, as
long as they do so within
seven days of crady's ruling.
