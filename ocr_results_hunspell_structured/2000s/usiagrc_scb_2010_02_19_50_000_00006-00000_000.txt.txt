Before coming to that part ormy me, where I was enabled by the kind mercy of
God to throw offforever those dreadhrl chains which kept my soul in heathenish 1g»
norance, and my body in constant torture, 1 will describe a slave wedding, orwhich I
was an eye-witness. ”— from the unpublished slave narrative "Autobiography afFranci's

Fredric, of Virginia~

Victors do notjust write history—rather, they disseminate it, validate it and incul-
care it. One example of this paradigm is the one-sided history of the sIave experiencef
Even though many students at Grinnell are familiar with Frederick Douglass' slave
narrative, most slave narratives went unpublished. Shanna Benjamin, English, teaches
an English seminar focusing on this group ofhistoric “losers" written aceounts ofthe
pre-Civil war era. Last Monday at noon in Faulconer Gallery, the seminars students
presented Readings otForgotten Slave Narratives.

Each ot’Benjamin’s students approached the lectern stoically, evidencing a deep re-
specr ﬂat the narratives’ writers. Then these 13 students each read an excerpt from an

unpublished slave narrative.

Before reading their narrative, most of the students provided background informa
tion about the author oftiieirpiece, both to contextuaiize the readings and to highlight

themes ufidentity, slave society and literacy.

Shaun, Ed battle dead

EV CouN CARR

The screenplay tor “Shaun ofthe Dead,”
written by Edgar wright and Simon Pegg,
accomplishes the delicate balancing act of
making wry and absurdist comedy work in
the context of an explicit zombie blood—
bath. Part of the projects excitement stems
from the realization that these polar genre
extremes actually synthesize with a certain
cleg ance.

g“Shaun of the Day" isnt the first ﬁlm
to realize the fruitfulness of this ﬁrsion. Per
ter Jackson’s “Dead Alive" did it decades ago
and did it with more ingenuity. But “Shaun
of the Dend"works because it knows how far
it can push us in a given directionrhe writ—
ers realize (despite a few lapses tn judgment
here and there) that the humor can only
work if there are characters we care about
at the center of the mayhem. But they also
have the nerve to realize that the sight of
maurauding Cannibals, dressed in bathrobes,
moaning eoitally and missing limbs, has the
perverse potential to be funny,

And, when the brutality goes too far,
costars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have the
charisma to keep things relatively grounded.
The two play Shaun and Ed, respectively,
best friends living in London. As the movie
opens Shaun is having a mediocre day. No
one at his job takes him seriously. He lives
in a crummy apartment—all the more of a
dump because he shares it with Ed. Even his
girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is losing in-
terest in him. frustrated with the rut he has

gotten himself into. However, when a zom-
bie attack breaks out onto the streets, Shaun
sees an opportunity to become a hero and
turn his Life around,

. This motivation does wonders in grounds
ing this otherwiserspectacular story in mun-
dane reality while highlighting the discor-
dance of the story elements being fused. As
we witness the collapse of civilization as we

- know it, we are asked to be primarily cone

cemcd for the status of a slovenly bachelor’s
love life. His selfrcentered “heroism” is made
even more dubious by his sidekick Ed, who
spends much this time drunk and whose
default line in difficult situations is "I've got
nothing." But this madness works because
Pegg and Frost have enough cockeyed charm
to make us want their simple lives to be kept
intact. Moreover, their “heroism" also works
because they have a fitting group of advere
saries. The zombies are as clumsy and {0017
hardy as Shaun and Ed tend to be after a
long Friday night.

The ﬁlm ends on a bleakly satirical note
that it doesn’t quite earn. It attempts a cri—
tique on middlcclass British life, suggesting
it to be its own kind ofzombic-ishness.The
comparison might be apt in another movie'
but, considering the lengths to which the
ﬁlmmakers go to make us care about these
characters’ lives, the satirical ,conclusion
seems like a callous afterthought. In the end,

“Shaun of the Dead” nevertheless pulls offal
tricky enough project to redeem this short»
coming.

RJD2 coming to you

3v MAX CALENBERG
RJD2? Huh? ‘Nah, I never really liked Star
Wars.”0hhl-i, oh yeah,l think I've heard of them,
they had that song on that T.V. connnercial, with
the humming and the horns, tight?
Stop.
Tummblists/Producers and their albums are a
branch ofhiphop not often climbed by the casual

.listenet. Outpuis range from D] Kahleds often

obnoocious gangsta rap posse cuts to Madlibs sub-
tly beautiful beats that ﬁlscs carlybladsmusicwith
its most popular current form. On this broad hip
hop spectrum Kanye West residesin the middle,
Kahled is often a yacht
in the middle of the
Caribbean. while RJD2,
real name Ramble John
Krohn, belongs natt to
Madlib and just. Blaze.
So yes, he is abit obscure
if you don't catch much
hip hop but his appeal
is entirely obvious once
you listen.

Rj'Dz's debut album, .
‘Deadringer," came. out
in 2002 on the now den
ﬁmct Deﬁnitive Jux Recordsflhattalbum features
some ofhis most notable work with the paranoid
“The Horror," a hack featuring so many menac-
ing sounds its title is redundantihen, there is the
one song everyone's heard. “Ghostwriter,” features
one of the best compositional buildeups the last
decade via a plucktd guitar that otplodcs into the
triumphant horned chews Suﬁan Stevens dreamt
of, but couldn't quite get right. Couple this widi
soulful ending track ‘Wotk” and you start to realr
he what RJ'DZ is so good at. He expresses um,
non brilliantly and wordlessly.

Well, he did in his ﬁrst and second albums.

His next two albums, “Since We Last Spoke" .
(2004) and “The Third Hand" (2007), bothpo fea-
tured Krohn on live instruments and voice. This
move proved a far less cirecuve method for his
artistic mion. .

Most recently, the Philadelphia based artist
dropped "The colossus,"a mixture ofhis two dis»
tinct styles and in some a return to his earlier
form.ltisalsiotheﬁtstalburnbeingreleasedunder
his own newly created label, RJ’s Electrical Cone
necta'ons, a process R] has found to be rewarding

overall

“I had relatively low otpoctations, but things
have been phenomenal Its a
lot harder, it’s a lot more work,"
Krohn said. “Though I deﬁnitely
feel it stream lined the process."

One dear beneﬁt of Krohn’s
expansion crsounds are the new
aspects it adds to his live show.

”I have so much more ﬁin
with this show than i do on my
own A big part of that is the vari-
ety. 1 get to play a couple ditfen
ent instruments and I'm not stuck
on the mmtzhlcs...thexc’s more
of an ‘X factor to do it." Krohn

said. “It’s very hard to get into an improvisational

mindset ifl’m just out there by myselfDJing."
When RJD2 takes the stage this Friday in

Han-is many people may be hearing him for the

ﬁrst time and.in a show which features his hill

range. The audience will see a master of vocals
samples,a supreme uscrofhorns and an artistwho
may be playing a song or two more for himself
than for die Listener: Plus, it sounds like they may
even have a iew surprises for us.

“i want people to come because this show is
unique, it's special," Krohn said, ”You're not going
to see this particular show again,"
