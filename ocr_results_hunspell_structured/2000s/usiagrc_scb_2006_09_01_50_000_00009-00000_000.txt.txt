A call to help,

Every day we awoke at 6:30 am. and from 7:30 a.m. to 3:00
pm. muckcd Katrina ‘stcw' from homes destroyed by ﬂood waters.
As interns with the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana, we led teams
ofvolunrccrs through the ditflculrics of gutting n home. We shared
rhc bcsr ways rc ducr-mpc a refrigcrrrbr shut, scaling oﬂ’ the rrucid
juicc oftcnrmonth-old gumbo and skim milk,bcforc loading it on a
dolly and wheeling ir our ro ilic curb.

We along wirh 11 other Grinnelllans spent om: to two months
volunteering in New Orleans this summer. As badly as we may have
smelled at the end ofthe day, we chose to
volunteer because New Orleanians are in
desperate need of our help. It was hurd
for us to go home at the end of the sumr “
rncr, because we left knowing that there _‘
are over 150,000 homes that have not
been touched since August 29,2005.

The following statements were writ-
rcn by Grinnellians who spent their summers in New Orleans.

"1 conic down here wirh rhc inrcnriun of doing good work and
parriug myselfon rhc back and going back to my life hnving spent a
summer doing somcrhiug I could be proud of. What 1 didn'r cxpcct
was for rhc ciry re get under my skin. For a city so Vibrant to be so
crippled by loss is tragedy enough to gcr rhc nrrcnriou of anyone
who has ever visired the ciry in irs glory drys. Bur what gcrs me
every time is the stories of families who used to live within blocks
of their more support network and extended family and now don't
even know where they all are. Unlike many cirics, people truly have
roots in this place, roots that were ripped out by the flood."

I encourage everyone on campus to think about whether or not
rhcy feel comfortable in rnd wirh our new spaces. Ifyou don't ﬁnd
comfort with this new Campus Center, go look for the “cozy" else—
where on campus. There are so runny comfortable, beautiful places
here barely frequented by students.

To the people planning our cnmpus’ future, I ask that you make
a grcarcr effort to cultivate that “cozy" atmosphere :it Grinnell and

stop and take photographs of munlated homes and buildings. It’s
voyeuristic. While it can be helpful to shar:,the besrway to make a
person understand is for him to Come down here himself."
—Amy Rarbbnum ’03
”Once I got down there it took a while for me to realize whar
I was seeing. The magnitude of the destruction of the City, the loss
suffered by the residents, rhe lack of services being ofrcred even
now—these things are almost incomprehensible to a girl who has
grown up in rhe privilege and cbmfurr ofmiddle America. Things
most of us rake for gmnted » 24rhour
access to henlth care, basic road main-
tenance, or near-by grocery stores — are
by no means guaranteed. Signs of rhc
desrruction caused by the storm nrc ev-
crywhcrc. Mosr houses srill benr the
sprayrpailltcd markings of the senrch
and rescue teams from last fall. Beneath
rhc freeway downtown an imprompru graveyard of drowned cars
has been created by the city, and giant rubble pilcs spilling lure the
streets mark houses rhar have recenrly been gurred."
—Fv:edn Brook ’07
When we got brick to school, we, along with the orher inrerns,
started the student group [renew] Orleans with (he inrenrion of
heading back to New orlenns as soon rnd as often as possible. The
state of rhc city is srill deplorable, one ycur later. The painstakr
ingly slow gmrting process is being completed mostly by volunteers,
Grinnellians have a long-valued involvement with social justice
issues, borh near and far from rbc college. Everyone 7 students,
faculty, staff, alumni, nclrninisrrrricn — needs to do more than just
remember New Orleans. We need to continue our tradition ofpror
viding help where it’s nccdcd most.

more fun than do-

It’s been a long time coming

Hi. I’m breaking rhis off. People thoughrwr’d last ,

for at least it year, but I’ve had it. You're inaccessible,
finicky, unpredictable and frequcnrly vncrucl've tried
to break rhrcugh your shell, to get inside and see some
meaningful ccnrcnr, but my efforts are largely unrc—
vvadcrl. I knew we'd be together long before I saw
you~l even had your number weeks before we met.
We all heard you were coming, and even though I was
in r happy, committed three—year relationship based
on healthy'commun'lcat'wnJ knew that fairytale had
to end. Your predecessor was always willing r0 be
open, to share I had the key to its heart and could see
through the window to its soul, Its dwellings might
not have been swanky, but at least we could conduct
our business quickly and cthcicntly. You, however, or
sist on publlcly humiliating me, mocking my income
percncc and denying me access to important things.
My ﬁngers are sure and my patience has run cur. Eff
you, mailbox 4703, it's over.

Mike mercy of 81h Avenue

Aﬁci being informed at the beginning of the
semester that we should look forward to another
year of: crappy Eth Avenue, it was re my dismay
thar I discovered Inst night just how crappy it is.
While merrily riding my bike over to the Forums
I mean the Grille—I chose to ride in the road to
avoid i pcdcsrriru on the sidewalk and was nearly
dcsrroycd by an unseen urcgulariry in the street.
I endured this indignity in front of it passing car
rhar almost hit me while I attempted to remain
upright on my bicycle. Lets get a lirrlc lighting on
8rh Avcnuc! We now have no excuse to surely wnnr
dcr around central campus, not at the mercy of cars
and hidden potholes.
