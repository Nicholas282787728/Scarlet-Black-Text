Q: Conldyau brie/1y doctrine you: iattgiciiud midyow ia-
woliiztricrit will; tilt AIDS trim in Afriza?

A: I'm a medical doctor. I graduated in 1971. After that I
did five years in [a] government hospital and nine years in a
private hospital and during the last years ofthat work in [the]
private hospital, the news ofAIDs started. It was around ‘82,
‘83, From that time we’ve been trying to see the cases, iden—
tifying the problems, treating patients, getting instructions,
learning more and more about the disease. And I got in-
volved with the social organizations which were catering to
the people who had been affected badly by the HIV/AIDS.

Q: Where it your work hired?

A: My work is based in Kisumu, but then we cater to the
whole ofWestern and Nyanza province,which [has] a popu-
lation ofarorrnd seven million people

Q: What aypommmer are available [17 the average Kenyan
pmim will: HI V?

A: The average Kenyan person, whether or not he is hav-
ing HIV infection, gets medical help from the government to
the tune of five dollars per year. That is the cxpcnsc that the
government shoulders on behalfofcach citizen.

Q: How iryoin- notiﬁindede

A: It's not essentially my work but it is the work which I
do in conjunction with different organ’ ations, and each or
ganlzation has a different way offund rising. Like, one orgir
nization is more funded from international sources, while one
organization is more locally based, It's usually by commrrnrty
support. Lately I've been getting funds from international
organizations which are specifically for helping the carrse of
[fighting] HIV/AIDS.

Q' In w/iaf ways ir [/11 admit in Kenya dﬂi’l'tlilﬁ'mii we
iii/me yon brew gmwi'n tip in India?

A: In India, there fire] a lot of professionals. There is a
lack of professionals in Kenya. I don’t know whether it is a
very fair perspective, but I felt that there was a lot of govern-
ment support for charitable and well—meaning social events

and projects. In Kenya we get support in name but we don’t get
material supporl.That is the main difference.

Q: What rim/II irriiia iiirpati HIV in iii/resrr/iaian ﬂfi itne

A: The social issues which are very predominant are the
presence of poverty in the land, the presence of illiteracy, the
lack of employment for all able-bodied people, the politics
which don’t allow a lot of money to be channeled to people's
affairs like medical care and the marginalization of women in
society. Women are not empowered to live their life the way
they want to. As children they are subjected to female genital
mutilation, they are less advantaged in the tamily structure. In
the marriage they seem to be under the dominance ofthe man.
Their decisions are made tor thcmtThcy do not generally own
a lot ofproperty or finance. I feel that the situation of females
needs to be improved. Ifthey'ro not improved then they’re une
able to improve their own status and get good medical care,
good attention for themselves, good treatment for themselves
and their families. ,

Q: How are iii/trim! inner bin/ring HIV more W widctptmd
problem?

A: Cultural issues like polygamy...defrnitely one infected
person ifhe has more partners [it] will affect more peopleThen
alcoholism and drug abuse increases the problem, because that
also leads to irresponsible sexual behavior than that causes the
disintegration of families. The organization of people. the
migration from the rural agriculturaltbascd society to the town,
employment-based society is further causing a breakup of the
families so that that increases the incidence ofHIV/AIDs.The
fact that some of the labor is mobile, like truck drivers who are
moving from town to town right across different countries——
they do accelerate the spread of AIDS. and the fact that the
land is mainly belonging to men. Even in inheritance the land
is parceled offto male rnhentors ofa family. so women do not
have as much say over then own lives and they don't have that
much economic base on which to be independent.

Q: How moii/dpingien be iriurieii ifmumty alone were gimii lo
Afr imiir nil/11 HIV?

A: Money would help and go a long way. There are a lot of
young professional people who are very kccn on lmplcmcntr
ing their piojccts and very deserving of help, so many would
be defrnite...help in development, But along with that we need
more accountability, more focus on social issues, more focus on
the general good tathci' than improving, say. the economy or
developing tons ofland or brrildings or technology

We have to make sure that these ones have the end in sight
that they will rehabilitate the orphans into the society Ifthey
are just keen on maintaining orphanages it doesn't help in
the least. It just keeps the person alive but it you give him a
job. and the knowledge ofhow to go back into society and be
good... so every development which is geared to putting the
people's efforts back into the society—[hilt wrll help. But if
it is only geared to, say, alleviating a lack, then it doesn't help.
If it empowers you to do something better for their society,
then it helps.

A: We are trying to emulate the formulat We have been
shown that example, and we are reporting it everywhere, and
we are really clearing up, and we are speaking a lot and trying
to be vocal, but definitely they’re ahead ofus, and you must
realize that they recognized the epidemic faster. and they
make the attempt {aster before us so we are behind them.
but we will catch up. I have full conﬁdence that at one time
this will not be a stigma. I feel that every disease has a history
during which it was a stigma. Medical advances has changed
the whole picture. so a disease like this - it undergoes a time
when people have ignorance when you don't have the real
oveicoming it then it becomes a cause and a stigma in god,
cry. But once things will open up, when the door to overcome
ing that will be open,whcn people will recover. when people
will know the cure or the treatment, then it will stop being a
stigma. We will stop fearing it.

A: I measure my success by the quality oflrfe that I am
able to provide for the patient. I would like to see them con—
tinrrc with their normal iobs, their activities, their function,
their role within the family and the community, not to be
hospital bound, not to be in declining health, not to be vic-
tim ofinnumcrablc infectious diseases,but able to withstand
and try to live a pretty good life except {oi the fact that they
have to take daily medication and they have to conre for
regular checkup. lust like any other patients with, say, high
blood pressure or diabetes. You know, the normal follow up
they havc to do. Apart from that they lead a pretty good life!
I feel that I must reach that stage when my management of
the AIDS patient should be of that degree that they can live

a good liie.
