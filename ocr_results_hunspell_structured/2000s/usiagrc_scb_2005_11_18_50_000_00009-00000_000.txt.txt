Israel to Grinnell

Transcending differences to address Israeli-Palestinian conflict

For me, “home" is, and will always be, Israel. IrIave
mg completed my tworyeai- mandatory military scrr
vice prior to coming to Grinnell, I have experienced
the Israeli—Palestinian conflict on a diiily basis, W hen I
had finally put my uniform away and got on the plane
to come to the U.S., I had never etpcctcd to hear the
words “Israel" or “Palestine" in a small town in the mid—
dle of Iowa. Curious and excited, I attended the first
meeting of the Palestinian Solidarity Group which I
later discovered was named "Intir
fadn" (an Arabic word for “uprisr
ing"). The name, which was later
changed, bothered me. It had nega—
tive emotional connotations which
evoked disturbing memories from
my many encounters with terror-
ism throughout my life. Being the only Isradi student
in the group, and in Grinnell,I feltvcry much alone.It
is never easy to hear others criticizing your own counr
try, resulting in an almost instinctive reaction of trying
to defend even a policy one does not agree with.1 came
out ofthc first meeting with tears in my eyes.

The irony of the situation
was that back home in Israel, I
had absolutely no problem criti-
cizing my own country and its
policies. Since a very early age I
have always volunteered for po-
litical organizations and peace
movements that worked for
resolution and equality, believing
that the occupation must end and that a Palestinian
state should be established. All my life, I have shared
similar opinions and criticism with the other members
of die Palestinian Solidarity Group, and yet in the con-
text of being the only Israeli in Grinnell,I felt defensive
and compelled to represent “the other side,"the "Israeli
side.“But I was wrong. -

It was not until I attended the ‘Sabeel Conference
on the IsraelirPalcstinian Conﬂict,’ that this realizar
tion truly sunk in. The conference was ormniaed by
“Sabeel,” a Christian-Palestinian organization, and was
clearly very critical of Israel’s policies on the issue of
the occupied territories. Sitting in the audience on the
first day of the conference was not an easy experience.
However,I soon discovered that this time I ms not the
only Israeli in the room.

Listening to jcw-ishrlsraeli speakers (Jeff Halper,
coordinator of the Israeli Committee Against House
Demolition: inJerusalem), as well as to Jewish-Ameri-
can speakers (Professor Marc Ellis of the American
and Jewish Studies at Baylor) helped me feel more
comfortable with expressing my views as an Israeli Jew
who strongly disagrees with a lot of things my govern-
ment (and military) does. Meeting other Israelis who
came to speak about their own experiences of the inr

yustiees our country is responsible for helped me realize
that when it comes to basic human rights violations,
such as living in terrible conditions under occupation,
tlicrc tire NO SIDES, Meeting and talking to Muslim
and Christian Palestinians for the first time in my life,
I begun to see the common ground and values we all
shared, values ofpeuce, equality and dialogue.

Coming back to Grinnell,I found that the college is
extremely divided Within itself, creating an atmosphere

of conﬂict and intolerance among
some ofits studentsl feel that this
extremely charged and emotional
subject is not being treated in the
right way by all afar, and I would
like to suggest an alternative. It
makes me very sad and discourr
aged to see that even thousands of miles away from
home, conflict still involves verbal violence and hate-
ful statements. If intelligent young adults in Grinnell
College are not able to reach a mic understanding of
each other's views through the commitment to a real
constructive dialogue, than I am left hopeless and fear»
ful of my own country's future.
If we cannot bring ourselves to
listen and respect one another,
and transcend childish competi»
tive “Grinnell plan wars," than I
doubt that I will ever live to see
the signing of the most yearned
for peace agreement between
the Israelis and the Palestinians.

I would like to suggest asking ourselves ifwe can do
better than we are doing at the moment. This conflict
cannot (and should not) be between a Jewish group
and a prorPalestinian group, if only because I belong
to both of them. When I say that for me “there are no
sides,"I do not naively claim that there are no disagree-
merits. But instead,l choose to look at the many simi-
larities I believe most. ifnot all Grinnellians share.

I believe we all would like to see peace in the Mid
dle East. I believe none of us supports the idea of oer
cupation of any sort, and 1 bdieve that we all condemn
violence (on both sides of the conﬂict). If we focus on
the things we all agree on for a change, I believe we’ll
be surprised by the many constructive conclusions we
may reach.

Finally, even surrounded be miles and miles ofcorn
ﬁelds, we are not at all as “removed" from this issue as
we‘re sometimes led to believe. Our Grinnell experi—
ence of this issue is in a my a TEST, a vivid example
of how effectivdineffective conflict resolution methods
could be, resulting in either failure or success at Peace
on a smaller yet very important scale. My very ambir
tious hope is that where my government and the PLO
have failed to communicate, we, here in Grinnell, will
succeed.

Look into the mirror, not at China

encourages greater savings along with 2| willingness
for leaders to cocouragc consumer restraint. Expecting
such efforts might be picrinrthersky theorizing in rhis
political atmosphere though, where weak politicians
have only the will to add pork spending to budgets and

rail about intelligent design and stem cell research.

It will come down to grassroots campaigning and
political pressure from below, as well as fundamental
changes in idl of our lifestyles, to make a substantive
change.

Students must fight cuts in federal grants

, m.—

Since the millennium, cutbacks in state-
guamnteed ﬁnancial aid have taken their
place alongside turkey, yarns and apple pie as
Thanksgiving staples for Grinnell College,
While state legislators have done their part to
make things different this year, federal law-
makers continue to be stingy with financial
aid programs.

We students know all too well the value
(and cost) of higher education, but many
members of congress seem to view colleg-
es and universities as cash cows to raid for

bridges to nowhere and other wasteful pork
Students should make their voices heard on
this issue and demand that legislators in Iowa
and Washington DC, give higher education
the funding it deserves.

With an economic recession, and sub
sequent losses in state revenue, Iowa has cut
ﬁnancial aid programs, such as the Iowa Tn-
ition Grant (ITG), for the past few years. lTG
provides Iowa residents who go to college inr
state with it maximum grant 083,900 if they
demonstrate ﬁnancial need. Currently, over so
Grinnell students reccivc a combined total of
over $204,000 from the program.

In past years, the legislature in Des Moines
has made curs for the program in the middle of
the academic year. Because it pledges to fulfill
100 percent of demonstrated student need,thc
college has to fill the gap when this happens.

This saps money from other uscfiu programs,
creates budget shortfalls and helps place up-
ward pressure on tuition rates for all Grinnel-
lians.

This year, with the economy starting to
heat up and tax revenues spiking, lowa law-
makers did the right thing and refused to cut
the ITG. But ' ' future is by no means safe. As
politically active citizens, students need to go
one step further and tell the legislature about
the damage that skyrocketing tuition is cuus-
ing to our fixtures.

If tuition does rise again, students will have
a difficult time getting financial help from the
federal government. Nearly one~third of all
American students receive needrbased federal
Pell gmnts, which offer a maximum reward of
54,050. From 1995-2001, this cap rose by 75
percent. Since then, it has remained stagnant.

Last week, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkln voted
to raise the cap by 3200, but a slim majority
of Republicans, including Iowa Sen. Churles'
Grassley, defeated the proposal. The news
made few headlines, but the voice of stu-
dents and parents was visibly absent from the
whole process.

If we have a responsibility to speak out
on issues of social justice, peace and equal-
ity, then we also have an obligation to take a
stand on this issue. Tuition hikes and aid cuts
strike very close to home, and the government
isn’t going to take steps to improve the situa-
tion unless we, the people who are affected by
current policies, make ourselves heard.

Fiscal responsibility is necessary and long-
overdue in Vlfisliington, but there are better
ways to balance the budget than mortgaging
our countiy’s future.
