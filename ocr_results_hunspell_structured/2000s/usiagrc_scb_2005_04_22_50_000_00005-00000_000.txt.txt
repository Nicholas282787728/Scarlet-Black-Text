You don’t really
have to grow up

Instead, enjoy a cult classic, a celebrity-filled
sequel or a journey to real-world Neverland

Donnie D ko (R)

Daum‘r Dmka is ii cult classic in
the best sense of the term. It's like Pi
made for young adults who aren‘t obr
scsscd with mathematics; the kind of
film you'll have to watch a few times
to make sense of the circular series of
events; an excellently executed and bin
zntre philosophical ramble on the twrsts
of science and human ﬂaws.

Thehcro,Donnic(]ake Gyllcnhaal),
is a socially awkward geek who may be
a sympathetic character for those who
have been outside the mainstream and
found themselves disenchanted with
school and society. He is constantly in
conﬂict with school teachers, parents,
psychiatrists, celebrities and the world
at large in a search for time travel and‘
an explanation for the inexplicable be-
havior of strange old women. Perhaps
he’s a little crazy or perhaps the world
in which he lives is a little crazy. Per—
haps it’s both,

In its cxistcntialist wandering, the
ﬁlm invokes a generous amount of scie
ence fiction. Donnie’s medications have
a difﬁcult time silencing visions and
voices from beings that are from ans
other time or planet. In a nod to Mary
Chase’s Harare-y, his contact with the
beyond is Frank, a giant talking bun-
ny rabbit, though one of a much less
friendly variety than Elwood's invise
ible companion. Frank’s messages are
usually vague and alarm Donnie—who
wouldn't be alarmed after being told the
exact day and hour that the world is go,
ing to end?—and the revelation of his
identity implies a slew otnew questions
that the film doesn’t seem to answer.

It may take more than one View
ing to make sense of exactly how time
warps result in an airplane fuselage
crashing through thc Darkos' ceiling
or just why the voices in Donnie’s head
told him to plant a hatchet in the statue
of his high school’s beloved mascot, but
the convoluted nature of the film's plot
is part of the charm. The twists and
turns are so bizarre and unpredictable

that they'll keep you glued to the Hat-
ris screen with a delightfully confused
look on your taco.

Finding Neverland
(PG)

Firrrlrrrg Moo/anal rccls, in many
ways, like a modern fairy tale.The ﬁlm
is based on (though departs significant
ly from) the true story ot 1M. Barrie,
the author of "Peter Pan," and the rela-
tionships that inspired his 20“" century
fairy tale.

The story is set in 1903,when]ames
Barrie (Johnny Depp) was a London
playwright in search of something in-
spiring to retrieve him from the depths
of mediocrity. His inspiration comes in
the form of tour young brothers whose
imaginative games James cannot help
joining. Spending time with rhc boys
and their mother (Kate Winslet),]ames
discovers that despite having recently
lost their father, Peter, Michael, George
and lack (all excellently played by relae
tive newcomers) are relatively carefree
and unburdened by the troubles of
adults. This is a refreshing change for
James, who is in a outrocating and un-
believably dull relationship with a for
mer actress.

The relationship between James
and the Davies children is mutually
beneﬁcial: James gets to spend time
with them to escape' his boring adult
life and in turn acts as a surrogate fa-
thcr ﬁgure for the boysThc transitions
between their fantasy world, in which
they they take on Indians, pirates, and
sea storms, and the real world are seam-
less, James uses the carefree fantasies
as material for his most famous work,
the perfoimances of which are touch-
ing and poignant

Depp is clearly the star of the film,
and does hisjob so well that it's hard to
believe he was also the dashing bucca-
ncer in Porto vfllu Caribbean. Staying
consistent with the simplicity ofchildr
hood, the film is rclateively emotionally

simple, but never simplistic. The boys’
fantasy worlds are also refreshingly
simple, and charming without relying
on elaborate special effects.

The theme of Peter Pan is “I don’t
want to grow up," and it is clear in
FindingNewr/nnd that this theme is as
applicable to James as the ﬁctional Pe-
ter, The film demands we believe that
retaining childhood innocence is pos
sible, and is incredibly convincing.

Ocean ’5 Twelve
(PG -1 3)

Why do we watch movies? Some
say it’s to induce a cathartic reaction to
a greater story and to feel connected to
the world at large, While that's some
times true, as with last weekend's gtipr

watch movies to see celebrity—glam-
orous pcoplc doing glamorous things.

A capella group to make “Sweet” sounds

Sweet Honey in the Rock, an all female African-American group that is politically
active through its music, will perform at Grinnell tonight in Herrick Chapel

Thirty-two years ago, Bernice johnson Reagon realized that po»
litical activism didn't always have to come in the form of matches
or protestsishe wanted to be politically active through music. This
idea led to the formation of Sweet Honey in the Rock, an all female
African-American a capella group that aims to "create a blend of
lyrics, movement and narrative that variously relate history, point
the finger at injustice, encourage activism, and sing the praises of
love.”

The group's music can be described either academically as “Afrh
can congregational choral style,”or colloquially rs “mustc that makes
you want to get up and dance," which is how Rebecca stuhr, director
orGrinncll's public events committee, expressed it. Made up otstu»
dents and faculty, the public events committee aims to bring Grin-
nell a “different" variety of musicians that would not get to campus
through other groups.

According to stuhr, sweet Honey in the Rock creates “deep,
powcrrul music" that encompasses “a rich sense of history." The
group “goes along with Grinnell's traditionithey are all at srs,"
Stuhr said and agrees with Rengon that mus can bc a potent me
dium for social causes. “Music gets your message out in an easier,
positive way Some people will come to a concert instead ofa speech,

so they have a much wider audience," she said.

For the last few decades, Reagan has worked for the Smithsonr
ian as a cur'utor and folklorist and, in 1989, Sweet Honey won a
Grammy for their contributions at a Smithsonian tribute to Woody
Guthrie and Leadbelly. Such historical consciousness was formed
young in Rcagon, who grew up in Georgia during the 19505 always
believing she would attend college and become a teacher. Her mush
cal identity was greatly inspired by the gospel music she heard ah
tending a black Baptist church throughout her youth

ln 1961, her role in the civil rrghts movement changed the course
other life: suspended from school for particrpating in demonstrilt
tions, Reagan switched schools and kept protesting—often With the
Freedom Singers, a student group that used music to educate the

ublic.
P In 1973, Rergon formed sweet Honey in the Rock around that
same idea ofut' Zing music as a medium for social activism and
einpowcrmcnt.Thc group’s current songs address issues such as ado
clrctron, environmentalism and Washington D.C. voting rights.

Although it has sold millions of records, Sweet Honey is most
popular tor its live performances which include songs rooted in gose
pcl, reggnc,blucs, iaaa, African lrrllabies and hip hop. The group will
be pcrtonning at 8 pm tonight in llerrick Chapel.
