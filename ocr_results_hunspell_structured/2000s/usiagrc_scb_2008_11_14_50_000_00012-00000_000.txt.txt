Addressing Veterans' day

Alright, so ﬁrst off I understand that veterr
ans’ day is meant to honor all veterans, and that
World War II was kind of ll big deal This said.
the holiday wns originally intended for those
who served in the First World “hr, hence why
it falls on Armistice day, November 11th. Grin-
nell’s wecldong celebration of WWII is rill ﬁne
and good, but come on now people, it’s the nine»
tieth anniversary of the end of the DC World
Wall We’re talking the bloodlctting that toppled
four world empires, gave rise to rhe Sovier Union
and marked the emergence ofAmen'eu as a globe
a! power. Maybe somebody should give a little
address about that conﬂict?

Where are the real groceries

WHAT?!

The lack of real groceries at the grill. 1 rt:-
member the forum nnd how I could buy a whole
box of cereal and a gallon of milk. Thanks for re-
ally helping me out

Hey, dining services, how about turning my
unused meals into dining dollars instead of f"
king stealing my money?

AND WHY IS THERE ONLY ONE
PLACE TO USE DINING DOLLARS?
THEY SHOULD BE CALLED GRILL
DOLLARS OR CLOSE-TO-USELESS
MONEY.
