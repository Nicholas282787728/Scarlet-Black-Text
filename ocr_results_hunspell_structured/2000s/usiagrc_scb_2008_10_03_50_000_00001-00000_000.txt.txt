Campus Democrats and Campus Republicans take different approachs to upcoming elections

av PATRXCK CALDWELL

While many students gathered across cam-
pus last night to watch the viccepresidential
debate, the debate could not affect the votes
for many orrhose watching, as a large number
of Grinnell students had already cast their bal-
lots.

Satellite voting was held in the Forum
South Lounge on Wednesday, providing sme
dents a chance to vote early. Wednesday’s
voteiand the preceding weeks of campaigne
ingidisplayed significant differences between
the two main political groups on campus.

While the Campus Democrats were out in full
force encouraging students to vote early, there
was rninimal presence from the campus Re-
publieans.

According to Poweshiek County Auditor
Diana Dawley, 695 people voted on the carnt
pus Wednesday. “I think it’s great that we’re
getting this many people to vote ahead of
time,” she said.

The early voting opportunity was open to
both students and town residents, so it is cur
rently unknown yusr how many ofrhe partieit
paring voters were college students But wirh

1565 people actively registered at 1115 8th
Ave—the address on-campus students must
use as tlieii residencyilt is likely that a large
number of students turned out on Wednesday.
The Democrats have run an aggressive
campaign since the start of the year trying to
encourage students to register in Iowa and take
advantage of early voting opportunities, “We
were knocking on doors and putting up signs
and handing out ﬂiers that had information on
them,"said Alec Schicrcnheck'OQ,co-leader of

ACE Security to be at some lounge parties

BY DAVID Loom

Ar last weekend's Loose tsc Ready parry,
revelers saw some familiar faces in some un-
familiar attire. Mingling among the partygocrs
in Loose lounge were two members of ACE
Security.

Starting this semester, members of ACE
Security will likely be present at some large
lounge parties in an attempt to decrease both
damage fines and hospitalizations related to
alcohol consumption.

The idea ofstationingACE Security meme
bers at lounge parties was ﬁrst floated at the
end of lasr year in a meeting between mem-
bers orsecuriry and student Affairs. A string
of dorm fines at the end of last year coupled
with an increased number of alcohol~related
incidents at the beginning of the current set
mester, prompted administrators and members
of Security to finally attempt placing student
security at lounge parties.

“It comes from a place of wanting to be
helpful to party organizers,” said Vice Presit
dent of Student Affairs Houston Dougharty,
who, along with cotdirectors ofACE Security,
made the decision to have Security at some

arties.“Somctimes there are a few significant
lounge parties] that can get pretty big and it
could be helpful to have ACE Sccutity thcre,
particularly to help folks who might be get-
ting theiusclves in trouble, who might be over-
indulging," he said.

ACE Security, the student—run security
and mediation organization, typically proVides
assistance at most allecampus events, including
Harris parties and SGA concerts.

Tim Hederman '10, one of the organiz-
ers of Loose and Ready, said rhe two Security
members provided a useful service without
giving the impression that they were policing
the party. "Their presence was subtle but use
ful," he said. “They were very discrete [and]

there were only two ofthern.

Members of both Student Affairs and
ACE Security said that the role of Security at
lounge parties would ditrcr significantly from
their role at Harris parties. According to Co»
Director of ACE Security Ben Howort ‘09,
members would not regulate alcohol distribu*
tion at check p-cards. They would act largely
as a mediating force in the event ofescalared
tensions.

“Any lounge is inside the dorm so we figure
ifyou got into the building, you have a reason
to be there," Howort said. “We're not check-
ing alcohol because that is still the person who
has the alcohol contract’s responsibility to only
serve the alcohol that they have the contract
fort"

Instead, Howort said, Security members
would focus on helping students and media-

’No preference’ counted as
’for,’ alternative tabulation
diverges from precendent

Bi’ DAVID LOGAN

Last Saturday, SGA released the ofﬁcial
results for this semester’s student initiatives.
With just 51 percent voter turnoar,14 of the
15 proposed eventually passed, But for what is
likely the first time ever, “no prcfcrcnce”votes
were combined with “for" votes, resulting in
the passage of 11 initiatives with otherwise
tepitl support.

According to the SGA Bylaws, the docu—
ment governing initiative voting, “Each initiar
tive proposal must be approved by twoethirds
ofrhe students voting, with a minimum ofso
percent ofthe student body casting a ballot.”

In an initial interview with the SUB, SGA
Administrative CoordinatorJoseph Schneider
'09 said that Election Board ofﬁcials had dc-
cided to interpret “no preference" as a vote for
the initiative because that is how it had his-
torically been interpreted.

But a review of SGA records and 538 at-
chives on initiative voting over the last three
years indicated that this was not the case.

in a subsequent interview in which he
acknowledged the change of precedent, Sche
ncider said the decision stemmed in large part
from a failure to consult previous practice. “We
should have done a little more institutional
probing. We didn’t talk to any previous Elev
tion Board members or anything along those
lines," he said.

“We just saw the percentages and saw the
Bylaws and just decided there was only one
way to interpret this in order to have a major-
iry ofiniriativcs pass this year," he said.

Had the “no preference" votes not been
counted with those “for,” only three_initia-
rives—those on “ﬂunk day,” smoking recepe
tacles and Freesoundiwould have reached
the two-thirds threshold. Two lmtlmlveS’m'i
hike pegs and a Cleveland lounge televisioni
passed despite both being famred by less than
40 percent ofvotcrs.

The issue was raised by Alex White ’12
at this week's Joint Board meeting during the
"Soapbox" session, a time reserved for students
to ask questions or voice concerns.

“I just noticed when I was looking at the
results {or the initiatives that indifference
votes were counted as ‘yes‘ and, quite frankl ,
indifference doesn’t mean yes," White said.
“And the fact that they used those votes sug-
gests that it sort ofcliauged the results of the
initiatives,"

Schneider has since acknowledged the
change in practice but neither he nor mem
bers of Election Board have indicated that
they would reverse the decision and revise the
results.

According to, Schneider SGA preferred to
see more successful initiatives and that inter-
preting “no preference" votes as not in favor
would have invalidated too many initiatives.
"Since the wording of the Bylaws states all
votes count, we chose to include the ‘no prefe
