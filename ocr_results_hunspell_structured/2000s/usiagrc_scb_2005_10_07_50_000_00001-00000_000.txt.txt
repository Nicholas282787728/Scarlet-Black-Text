Rosh Hashanah begins: still no new rabbi hired

Celebration of High Holidays have been led by rabbinical student as search enters its eighth month

xv AMELIA Koran)

For the ﬁrst time in years, when Jewish prospective
students visit Grinnell College ask, 'Does Grinnell
have a rabbi?”, the answer will be “No."

Grinnell has been without a rabbi since the end of
last year and hopes to find one by the end ofthis year.
Until then,]ewish students on campus are making do
without a permanent rabbi, although the college has
hired an adjunct rabbi for the High Holidays.

When Rabbi Deborah Brin announced in March
of last year that she would he leaving her job as Ass
sociate Chaplain, the administration decided to effec
tively eliminate her position.

As Associate Chaplain, Brin advised nonsjcwish
religiotis groups and coordinated multirfaith Pm,
gramming tor the Chaplain’s Oflice, but the new job
description does not include these duties. Under the
new descliptton, called “Rabbi and Other Duties," a
rabbi would work part-time as a religious leader and
poll'l’Ilinc on other college duties. The description
does not speciiy what the alternative duties as need-
ed by the College” would be, but it mentions mental
health counseling as a possibility.

President Russell Osgood contributed to the de-
cision to change the description. “We would work out
the othel hall‘of the job based on the indiVidual and
the needs ofthe college," he said.

Chaplain Deanna Shorh, who is conducting the
search for a new rabbi, announced the job opening
to all major seminaries, the campus network Hillel,
the entrant/c a/Hrg/arreanra/ian and the placement
offices of Reconstructionist, Reform and Conserva-
tive Judaism.

No room for Grab & Go next year

Eleven candidates have expressed interest since
the Job was ﬁrst posted in March. Only half have had
rabbinical credentials and none have been offered the
job. “The search has not yielded a candidate who ms
a good fit, whether for him or her or {or the cam-
pus. “Others have withdrawn from the process," said
Shorb.

Vice-president for Student Services Tom Crady,
who is Shorb’s supervisor, said that the search is “tak-
ing a little longer than expected."

Crady believes that a fullrtime chaplain, Lilly inr
tern and half-time rabbi provide adequate stafﬁng for
the Chaplain’s office. “I think the ofﬁce is covered well
right now," he said,

Osgood agreed. “We have a really high stathng
level for our chaplains omce compared to our peer
institiirions,"hc said,

The scaich has been difficult for several reap
sons. The job description wtts not posted until after
the typical rabbi hiring period in the spring aiound
seminary griiduarions. Also,' it takes a CCrUln kind of
rabbi to come to Grinnell, lowa, ti small town with
out a large Jewish population. Additionally, “the job
description has been really conhising to people," said
Jaime Frankie ’03, a leader of the Jewish student group
Chalurzim. "They don't always apply, or they change
their mind atrer they've applied."

Ben Baker '06, another Chalutziiu leader, agreed.
“lfthe college doesn’t give the impression ofknowlng
what it wants, how is that going to encourage ctindir
dates to apply for the position?" he said.

Crady, who was part ofthc decision to change the

With opening of the Joe Rosenfield ’25 Campus Center in Fall 2006, the future of meal equivalen-
cies at Grinnell remains uncertain, as does the employment of Grab 8: Go swiper Connie Coleman

There is no space in the new campus center des-
, ignated for a Grab 5c Go and there is no plan for
budding one.

“I’m not saying we
shouldn't have it," said
Dick Williams,
director of Dining
Services, “but there
are challenges to
all of the options
we've scan."

Williams said
he wants to have a
solution to the situation by spring semester and cm,
phasizcd that there are three months to formulate a
plan, hopefully with student iiipur.“1rtiiere’s interest,
we can put options together and see the feasibility,"
he said.

John Kalkbrenner,Vice-president of College Serr
vices agreed. “We hear that students want a Grab 8c
Go and we just need a good plan for delivering the
service," he told the S {9’1} via email.'

The exact nature of that service re

as a result ofa shoulder disability. The dining services
