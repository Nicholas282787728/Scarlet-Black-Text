THE lliIDE'EYED FIRST
YEAR RESCUE DOG

“lﬁiminutes-i an hour:
E hour‘si who knows?"

Apparently, there is a methodto be»
ing a rescue dog that was lost on me. A
few of the veteran dogs had most of their
goodies left at the end ofthe night, while
my supplies lasted somewhere between
20 and 30 minutes. That may seem like n
waste, but let me tell you, those 20 min—
utes were pretty damn sweet. I know that
some strangers had a better time at 10/10
heeanse‘onhe goods I gave them.

My ﬁrst 10/10 was a night to be
remembered, even iflny memories are a
little shady. It began mundane enough,
with a couple ofdrinks atNOlTls.'l'l1is ﬁrst
leg of the journey was an obvious warm-
up for the madness that would ensue, and
I’m sure the people who eleaned up Norris
appreciated that. l

A short walk down the loggia and the
pnitywns at Gatesn huge funnel ofbodies
and sweat headed into the lounge. Since
the location of the kegs wasn’t optimal,
reseue dogs heeanie the preferred distribu-
tors otaleoholl had been storing my bag
0' goodies up in my room, and when the
crowd started heading'to Younket,I took
a detour back to my room to, pick up the
goods. -

I hung out at Youi'llac’r 1?): or
listening to the music and talking
friends, until I realized Lime eating
midnight. All night I had been‘waning for
thc infamous campus-vii shot on Mac
Field, the ultimate show I
freedom' in a campus ﬁlled with both. It
seemed like I saw nearly everyone rkn
at some point, even if theyih’ad to remind
me of' it the next dny.

With the eitciternentbecoming nearly
tangible, I took my shot of hiskcy with
the rest of my classmates, and the true-

signiﬁeanee of 10/10 ﬁnally occurred to _ » ,

m it is a campus wide declaration ofour
love ofself— governance It' is a loving nct

ofcanlpus unity and, in my opinion, the ‘

ﬁnal step in integrating the ﬁrst years in
to the Grinnell community.

Finally the party hit Gardner/Cleve-
land Beach. By this point my memories
are few and far between, but I'm pretty
sure it was a perfect Conclusion to this
incredible piu'ry. After sitting with my
friends on Mac Fleld for a while (13
minutes, an hour, 2 hours, who knows?),
I called it a night and stumbled back to
my dorm.

FEAR AND LOATHING
IN GRINNELL

10/10 is the only day of the year when
the sober kids working in the Grille don’t
know or don't give a crap-that you just
walked out with three free drinks [0 mix
with your handle of $12 vodka. ’lhcy see
the handle of Hawkeyc, give rm: and the
others a slight grirnaee, and just look the
otherway'lhat disgusted look is emcrlythe
wry we'll reel tomorrow,

“hiking out of the IRC, there's a hint
otthe ensuing ehnos,hut the loggins are still
soher as we walk towards En Cnnpus.

A slew of familiar faces 'et us as we
tnnnple through the lounge. More heer,

“FYI:

more people, more conversations that will
surely be forgotten.

“m you can't get a DUI on ahieyde."
These arc life lessons.

“Shoot blinds, bounces are two enps,
two sinks in different cups is backs, two ill
the same is double backs and two I:’l(\CkS."
These are life lilies.

I make the tick ncloss Mac Field
towards the promise of more life, I can
hear pcoplc out now, yelling ohseenines,
screaming fol no reason and piolnismg to
meet up with each other later.

In flout of Younkel‘, some random

Yolmlilrltas

person from my ﬁrst year tutorial yells out
my name. On nw other side,sorne random
townie offers me a swig from his pitcher.
Neither of these seems like a good option,
so I make the obvious choice: slide tackle
a ﬁrsttyetlr,

Stumbling onto Mac Field, there was
madness in every direetion. Small Dixie
cupswith cute little g ts were deseemted
with Ten High whiskey, It feels like heing
i kid again,

There's i spcccll.'l'lle shots keep being
poured, It may not here even been real
