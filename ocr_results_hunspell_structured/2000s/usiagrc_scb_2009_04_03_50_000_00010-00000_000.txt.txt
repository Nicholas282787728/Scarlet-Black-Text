Changing the hiring process

Hiring7 and ﬁling pidcticcs at Giinncll
College have licen a topic ofircquent campus
conversation this year. Such discussions were
sparked again recently when the History Der
pattnicnt decided not to hirc a popular term
professor for on: of its tenure-track positions.

According to those involved with the de-
cision, the controversial decision was attrib-
uted to the candidates’ job talk performances.
While this system for evaluating professorial
candidates affords students some means of’ ms
put in the decision- -making process, it is overly
rigid and does not elrectlvely communicate
how a candidate will perform in the classroom,
The format for evaluating prospective profes-
sors should he adjusted to hotter capture how
candidates will actually teach.

Many academic departments look to their
SEPCs and students at large to assess the qual-
ity of candidates. Students have the opp Gml'
nity to attend lunches and formal yob talks in
which the candidate presents on a topic of their
choice and then fields follow up questions

While these talks may provide a glimpse
into the candidate’s academic credentials and
professorial
prowess, they
do not néccssat-
ily tcflcct on the
candidate's ‘po-
tentialclassroom
performance.
These talks are
largely directed
at sitting ﬂiculty,
who tend to dominate both attendance and the
posrrtnlk question period, Interaction between
die lecturer and students is generally limited
and, when present, an arsenal.

Classes at Grianc are rarely this formal;
instead, they are often discussion-hosed and
rely on active student panicipation. While
excellent academic credentials are important,
this College pridtzs itself, first and foremost, on
being a teaching institution and its professors
should he hired accordingly.

In addition to the aforementioned job
talks, departments should proi-idc forums

that more closely resemble class dynamics at
Grinncll. some departments, such as math

V'St‘éff‘ dilloriaul

and psychology, invite
their candidates to guest
teach during a class per
riod. They sometimes
a providr: students
with literature relevant
to [ ir topic.

This format provides
students and faculty
greater insight into how
a candidate would fit within the classroom and
the department. Candidates who may not ex~
cel a: more formal lecturing may nevertheless
perform better in a classroom setting.

Professors at Grinncll are expected to do
more than simply talk at their students. They
must be willing and txdtcd to facilitate dia-
loguc, while mentoring their students in an ac-
ademically invigorating and emotionally nur-
turing environment. A more lecture should not
he the determining factor in hiiing Grinnell
professors.

Take advantage of Grinnell’s tiny campus

Carlos Lu ’lO reminds readers of the many benefits our small campus has to offer to students

Howlong did thiltdrive take? I bet lttooklont
gcr than however long it takes to drive from
the East D parking lot to Chuong's going the
speed limit. And if you did drive a distance
shorter than that, then I hope you were in
Siberia and you couldn’t walk because it was
so cold and windy that if you had walked, you
would have died.

I bet that a few of you Visited friends at
other schools. Listen to Asher Roth much?
And 1 bet your friend's campus was bigger
than Grinnell’s (I’ll even bet my fake tooth on
it) It takes your friend half an hour to get to
class? And that's ifhc catches the 8 am. bus to
get across campus? Oh, so that’s why he never

Living in such a small world. it's easy to forget

Let’s face itiwc Grinncllians live by con-
