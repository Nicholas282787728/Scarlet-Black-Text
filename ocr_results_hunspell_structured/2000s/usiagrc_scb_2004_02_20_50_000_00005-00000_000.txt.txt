The ston/ of how Pete
Pennington ‘04 transformed
his analytically—oriented mind
into one that also appreciates
the simple beauty of music

composer Roberr schiimann once said,
”People compose for many reasons: To become
immortal; because rhe piano rorre happens to be
open; bemuse rhcy wanr re become a millionaire:
because ofthc pnisz of friends; bemuse they have
looked inro a pair orbeuuiihil eyes; for no mson
whatsoever."

Music major Pore Pennington ’04 says rhar for
him, borh lisrening in and composing music ﬁlls a
certain void,

“1 lisren for certain rmsons and compose for
others," he said. "Music an take me out of some
rhing and pur me in somerhlng else."

concert devoted to two of his compositions, But
while his passion for musicwould be reason enough
ro go, Penningron‘s srory is a lirrle more complex
than that. 0135de ringing from a minimal knowle
edge of music, as of rose a few yeais ago, and a
srnigglcwlrh alcoholism make Penningron’s srory
all the more incredible.
