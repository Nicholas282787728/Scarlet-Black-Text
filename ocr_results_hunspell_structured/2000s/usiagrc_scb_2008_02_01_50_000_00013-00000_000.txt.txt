comes amidst the cheers of the fans. The

playing with excitement
and gusto. In the old days,
the air was filled with some
overplayed rap songs. Now,
during timeouts half time
and ivaim ups the brass m-
struments fill the air.

The playlist varies from
typical spoits tunes to the
effervescent “Hips Don't

however, the fans respond gloriously and raise

Ktejsa and Ben Iberle ’10 decided to form a
pep band

The word spread like wildﬁre and before
they knew it, they had more than enough
members to go on with the pep band.“ i went
on plans and saw there was a [pep] account,"
said Reavis, “I use to play pep hand in high

Giille- -goers were greeted with the harmo-

There is even talk from the pep band
about going above and beyond and ventur-
ing into the unknown otsporrs such as track
and field. “Basketball was the first season
that the band was ready to go," said Reavis.
“It would be cool to expand it to football, or
even uiiti'aditional [band] sports like baseball
or cycn ttack,"Just imagine pep band belting
out the melody of“l3eirii to Run" during the
next track and field event.

Even though their prim v focus is has-
