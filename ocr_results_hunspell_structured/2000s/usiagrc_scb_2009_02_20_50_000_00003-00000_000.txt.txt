Theies another acronym being added to the numerous
others that confuse first-yeats and stump paicnts.

The Student Initiative Fund (StiFund) is changing its
name to the Student initiative Committee (STIC). Accords
ing to STIC Chail Bill Mogaueio ’12, the name change emr
phasizes the committee’s purpose of helping initiative spent
sot carryout their initiatives goals after spending S’i‘iC’s
initial funding.

“We can‘t use [our funding] for ongoing commitments, so
a lot of our job is finding someone that can fund these min-a
titles,"l\/logavcro said.

STIC plans to continue to help students who pass inir
tiativcs secule future funding from other gloups on campus.
STIC Representative Ami Freeberg 10 helped Anders Ahlt
berg 10 and Hugh Redford 10 find further Pfunding for their
bike shop initiative once they had spent then original budget
from STIC.

“ST 1C gave us money for the start up, the one time puts
chases like tools and stands," Redford stud For thinvs that
we go through, uc‘le just going to be applying for funding
through the Student Ploglalnnung Committee.

SGA Pmsidcnt Neo Morakc '09, who is a member of
STIC, said STIC provides llel with a'nother avenue to advot
care for student concerns.

“It’s a chance fol me to see what else students are cont
cerned about and that’s what we're trying to do in Joint
Board," Morake said. “Senators try to figure out what needs
to be done or any concerns that the constituents have so that
we can implement them thlough Joint Board. But STIC is a
different method ofhnplemeutiag change on campus because
students are doing it themselves."

According to Mogavero, the Committee is also trying to
become more transparent by announcing the outcome of each
passed initiative publicly so that students are not discouraged
from using the initiative process. In the past, several initiatives
that were out of STIC's financial reach have been abandoned
Without any notice given to the student body.

consider hiring new professors that this is a priority for the
student body,"Mogavcro said. “At this point 1 don't know how
eager the college is to hire new professors because of money.
We did all we could but it's definitely not a simple thing that
the STIC could accomplish all on its own."

The social Entrepreneurs of Grinncll
(SEG), a student organiztion that provides
interest- free loans to struggling businesses
abroad In developing countries, is applying
for non profit status. Members ofSEG said
there are financial and organizational ben-
efits to obtaining a 501(c)(3) status from
the IRS.

According to SEQ co»1cadcr Harry
Krejsa '10, nontproﬂt status would have the
potential to improve the group's ﬁnancial
situation. Under 501(c)(3) status, donations
to BBC and their fiscal transactions would
be tutexempt. “Once we're an ofﬁcial none
profit, people will be able to give taxrder
duetible donations to us, making larger dot
nations easier and more attractive," Kresja

New website

BY HARLEY ClmNo

With endless possibilities for a website
banner, Grinncll's choice has left a number
ofstudcnts unsatisﬁed

Ahead of a major overhaul of the Col-
lege's website, smaller changes to the ban-
ners ofthe front page and Pioneerweb have
raised concerns among students about the
direction the new design of the website.

Director of Communications Kate
Worster said that the decision to change
the banner was part of an effort to make
the website conform to the style of the
college‘s other publications. “I consider the
website to be a part of the College’s publi-
cations, and if you look at them, whether
they're from admission, diversity, athlet-
ics or so on, they all have the same type of
branding,” Worster said. “If the rest of the
publications are like that, then why not the
website as well? Plus, many different audi—
ences read our publications, so the branding
brings it all together."

students have presented concerns about

said.

Members also said that norrproﬁl stat
tus would allow SEC to extend beyond the
role of a typical student group, within and
outside of the context of the College. “W:
feel that becoming non—profit will seriously
increase the legitimacy of SEC in the eyes
of the government, on campus, and in the
greater Grinnell community,” co-leader
Emily Kugisaki ’09 wrote in an e-mail to the
seas. "we hope to continue expanding and
growing into the community as more than
just a student group.”

The application process, which began
last semester, has required the formation of
a Board of Trustees, consisting of students
and community members, as well as dozens
of pages of paperwork according to Krcjsn.

“It has taken many weeks just to get all
of the materials and documents together
that we need to complete the application
because we basically started from scratch
with nothing more than a vision for SEG,"
Krejsa said, "We had no bylaws, charter, no
‘ofﬁcial' rules for anything"

With much of the preparation finished,
SEC has already submitted the state no“,
profit status application and soon will subs
mit the federal application. “The federal
one is significantly more in depth. We’re
essentially done," Kresja said, “We're just
putting all the various pieces together and
we’ll have the application offin a couple of
weeks. we hope to become an official non
profit in a year.”

According to Kresja, norrpfoﬁl status

will not change the basic function ofSEG.
“Even ifwe re a non-profit, it doesnt mean
we Can't make a profit on our loan," Krey'sa
said. "Ifwe come out ahead on repayment of
loans, that money will just go straight back
into the pot to grow our portfolio, to add to
the principal ofsomeone else's loan.”

Doug Caulkins, dirccwr of the Wilson
Program in Enterprise and Leadership, a
member of SEG's Board of Trustees, said
that SEC has proven itself as a role model
student group. “This is exactly the kind of
program we encourage to see on campus
enterprise means creativity, and SEC has
done just that—effectively and for social
cause," Caulkins said.

the change to SGA, according to SGA Vice
President for Student Affairs John Burrows
'10, “Although students feel they lacked
input on the Website's change, I believe
change in any direction is better than the
seven yearlong status quo," Burrows said.
"It shows that at least we are taking positive
steps toward making the website better."

ran Atha '09, a Computer science major,
said he felt changes to the website should
undergo testing and feedback periods prior
to going public. Ht: suggested the resulting
backlash has ensued because minor changes
dramatically alter how people experience
the website.

“The website is the first thing people
see when they want to know about our
school nowadays. I think the banner change
.. makes the mistake of telling people and
not showing them," Atha said. “Instead
of telling me Grinnell is a ‘place of and
less possibilities,’I want to see examples of
endless possibilities on the websiter"

Others, such as Mark RoottWiley '09
who has submitted an independent prot
posal for a new website design, said they
felt the new banner has tailored the webs
site to prospective students at thc expense
of current ones. "Grinnell has always been
about the students," RoottWiley said. "If

the website really wants to show that the
College is about the students, there should
be more on students and showcasing what
they have been doing,"

The complete redesign will not occur
until the entire websitercvery link and filer
is converted to the new open source system
content management system Drupal.

Drupal provides the College with an
online support community, which will ale
low for more innovation in the future. Ac-
cording to Worster, the conversion has been
slowed due to budgetary issues,

“With our system now, we pretty much
have to reinvent the wheel every time we
want to do something new,” said Worstct.
“With Drupal, chances are that if we need
something newly developed for our system,
someone in the online community has al-
ready done it, which simpliﬁes things great-
