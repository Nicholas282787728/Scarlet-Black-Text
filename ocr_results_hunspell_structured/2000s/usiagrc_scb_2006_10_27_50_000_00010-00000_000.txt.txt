Women’ 5 tennis wins MWC Championship

Bv ALEX WOODLE

The women's tennis team avoided any Fri-
day the 13th curses when they defeated Beloit
College and St. Norbert to win the Midwcst
Conference Champronshrp on oct. 13. The
team championship capped an undefeated
conference season, as the Pioneers finished 9,
3 overall, 470 in the MWC. All of the team’s
losses came to Iowa Conference opponents, a
conference generally regarded as a higher level
of competition than the MWC.

The team went up against Belon in the
semiﬁnals, a team Grinncll dCfcatcd 7-2 ear-
lier in the season Both the second and third
doubles teams were victorious, with Maya Ll’
pert ’09, Katie Colver ‘09, Laura Gotfinlin '09
and Jill Altiy. Ina '10 defeating thcir opponents

for the second time this season to iaek up two
points for the Pioneers.

“They had the advantage the second time
around,” said Akryama of the Beloit players,
noting that they had better understanding of
the Pioneers’ strengths. But Margaret Block
’08, Colvcr and Akiyama went on to win their
singles matches, and Grinnell notched a 571
team victoiy.

Grinncll’s top two players did not play
therr- rnatches against Beloit. During the sear
son, matches usually go to nine points, and
all players complete their srngles and dorrbles
matches. But due to time constraints in the
plilyotfs, the matches are done as soon as any
team wins the fifth porrrt.

After winning the scrnrﬁnal, Giinnell ad-

vanced to the final against St, Norbert, where
they earned a 5-2 victory to become the Chal“*
pious ofthc Midwest Conference.

WIth the Team Championship rn hand,
the team prepared for the doubles and singles
tournamcnts the following weekend. The {on
rnar consisted ofthe number one singles player
from each team competing againstother nIIm~
her one players and so on down through teams'
number six players.

The doubles tournament canre rrp ﬁrst,
and Lipert anti Colver won ﬁrst place in then
grou Both the first and third doubles tennis
consisting of Sliweta Khajuria '07, Rachel
Engli '08, GolTnIan and Akiyama took second
place.

The Pionccts posted impressive perfor-

mances in the singles tournament as well, with
Engh, Colvet, Block and Akiyama each defeats
ing three opponents to win first place. Lipert
and Khajuria took second,with Khajuria being
forced to drop out due to a wrist injury

“Everyone played hard and was at the peak
of their game," said Goffman. None of Giin-
ncll’s singles or doubles representatives ﬁn-
ished lower than second in the tournaments,

The Pioneers will aim for a repeat perfors
mance next season, as they are slated to lose
just one player, number one Khajuria, to grade
udtion.

“I couldn't have expected more," said coach
Barb Waite ofthe team’s success, “These play-
ers have a tremendous amount ofhcurt, Even
when they get trr-ed, they just keep going,"

Volleyball season about more than wins

to make the season a success in ways that don't
show up in the wins and losses columns.

“It really was a good cxpcticnce,”said Cait-
lin Heltcrline 10 We all get along really well
and we have great team chemistry. We never
ﬁgured out the exact problem, but I think next
year Is very promising.

Calling Hclterline and
company’s season "tough"
would be an understatement.
Two of Grinnell's senior caps
tains,Tamrah Collins ’07 and
Jessrea Hodgman ’07, were
on the bench for a signiﬁcant
part ofthe season due to injus
ry. Also holding the Pioneers
down were injuries to younger players, ha ,_
ing to teach players new positions and having
fewer players in the rotation.

Injuries were the main reason Grinucll
chose to cancel its last games against nations
ally ranked Coe and Central Colleges. “It was
a coaching decision, but I think most of the
team agreed,”Helterline said.

As the programs philosophy states, “Each
season will have its highs and lows, in terms
of how one views success, but the overriding
emphasis is on enjoying the experience," Ens

Collins gained a new perspective on her
team and the season while she was forced to
sit on the sidelines.

“I think they taught me a lot about play-
ing and about what it means to be on a team,”
Collins said, “A positive attitude is important
because if you don’t have a positive attitude,
you'll never get out of a
struggle. The girls are
great volleyball players
and great people. I was
lucky to play with them."

ise in the young team. In
a conference where Car-
roLl College went 0-9 last
year and ﬁnished second
at 63 this year, big turnarounds are possible.

“We worked really hard this season and it’s
tough working really hard and not winning as
much as you should,"Collins said. “Hopefully
next year all that hard work, positive attitude
and dedication will fall into place."

Despite the lows in the season, the high
points shined through enough that the team
is excited for next season. With some top re-
cruiting targets applying early decision, and
with the experience the young team gained
this year, things are looking up for Pioneer
volleyball.

Is the MLB wild card

As a lifelong Michigander, I am ecstatic that the Detroit
Tigers are playing in the World Sense and have distracted me
all season from my true baseball love, the hapless cubs.

That said, there is a glaring fault in the résumé ofthe 2006
Tigers. they failed to win their drvisron. TheTigers squandered
the AL Central title away to the Twins by losing five of their
last six games including a sweep at home to the Royals, a team
that Triple A clubs could contend with Thanks to the Tigers
first half tear through the
majors, though, they gently
fell into the wild card spot.
Then they started trying
again and rolled into the
World Series.

Should the Tigers den
feat the Cardinals, they
would become the fourth wild card team in the past five years
to win a championship. Surely this isn't the ratio that MLB bigr
wigs wanted when they implemented the Wild card in 1995,

I grant that the wild card beneﬁts baseball. Usually, the re-
cipicnt is a team playrng postseasonsquality baseball for much
of the year, demonstrating that it should play along with the

diVision Winners in October. The problem is that in a sport
where only division winners participated in the postseason for
over a century, a sccondrplace team should not waltz into the
playoffs along with its ﬁfskplﬂce counterparts with negligible
punishment. What importance are the first 162 games when a
team can have a fantastic season yet 105: a short series because
their opponent gets hot and steals a game on the road? Major
League Baseball should make changes so that the wild card
truly represents a playoff consolation spot.
To do this while still keeping the cur-
3’09 rent playoirstrucrure, Major League Baseball
should first revert back to the old divisional
structure, with two divisions each producing
a-winner and a wild card. No radical realign-
ment would be required, just a reversion to
the tire-strike dwisions.This structure would
elIminate the inferior divisions in today‘s MLB, such as the AL
and NL West, and ensures that two deserving div' ion win-
ners and two deserving wild cards make the playoffs. Many
years (such as 2006), the teams would remain the same, but rn
other years, undesel'ving teams like the 2005 Padres (NL West
Champs at xzsso) would be out ofthe playoﬁ's,

serving its purpose?

Second, a greater incentive to win the division should be
given through a more substantial playoffhome ﬁeld advantage.
First otall, take away some otthc luck factor by expanding the
first round to seven games (since five games is too much of
a crapshoot) and then give the division winners ﬁve games at
home in a 3—2—2 structure for any series in which they play a
wild card team. Since home teams have a winning percentage
of.539 during the playoffs. this structure will deﬁnitely increase
incentive to win the division.

This doesn’t make wrnning a series impossible for wild card
teains, just signiﬁcantly harder, ensuring that the wild card
teams that srrrvive the ﬁrst round truly deserve to advance.
What team would sit back, content with the wild card if the
penalty was to beat the Yankees two out of four on the read
while also winning their two home games?

it is difficult, though, to tell what impact this change would
have had on the‘ZOOé playoffs, as it is tough to know how much
an extra home game would have impacted each series. What I
can ensure, though, is that this proposed system would make it
significantly tougher for a secondsplace team to erase the ”pk
lar season triumphs of a drvrsron winner, making success over
162 garncs a greater key to success in the next seven.
