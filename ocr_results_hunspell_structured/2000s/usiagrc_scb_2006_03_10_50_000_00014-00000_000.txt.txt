Letters: to
Commend protest

Id like to express my disappointment with last weeks staffedi-
rorial titled “Student protest weak."1n this piece you condemn four
Free the Planet mcmbers who, as you wrote, were arrested on {ldlCU’
lous chargesThe students declined to speak with you based on their
lawyer’s advice, and consequently, you condemn these students for
“not sranding up for their cause"

Perhaps you were attempting to make a point about apathy at
Grinnell? So you chose to condemn a group of activists, Yes, that
will certainly encourage students to be more active! Maybe you
were trying to spark debate? A personal attack on four individuals
will spark debate about the quality of the journalism displayed
in the S £919,

As a non-activist myself, I can only admire people who act
on their convictions. The students in reference are admirable be-
cause they were putting their beliefs into practice, not because
they were arrested. l’m bewildered by your condemnation of
people who were genuinely trying to effect a positive change.
Apart from this particular case, I’m disturbed by the editorials imr
plication that only students who are willing to sacriﬁce their future
for a cause have the right to take it up at all.This kind of exclusive,
scornfiil attitude discourages every type of action.

I believe that in this instance the 558 editorial staff does not
represent the Grinnell College community as a whole. I believe we
are a community that has respect for emery positive effort to improve
the world.

Editorial reckless

Lastweek, you derided the four FTP members who were report-
edly arrested in protest of something or another about Victoria's
Secret. You compared their actions to Chris Gaunt's, who was are
tested during this years‘ SotA protest, finding those of the student
protesters to be categorically less valuable than Gaunt’s. You laud
the librarian with praise.

But you go further than this obviously flawed argument, which
presumes that the only inherent value of protest is media debacle
and sclf-incrimination.

Hell, their actions should. at worst be seen by the Grinnell come
munity, most of whom spend their Saturday mornings recovering
from hangovers, as of neutral value.

The most egregious aspect of the article is that you ascribe m0,
tive to the protesters actions after their arrests, accusing them of
mere ostensible commitment, and worse, of only looking out for
grad school chances and potentially obstructed job interviews,

From where do you claim this elevated stance on selftsacrifice?
Because, speaking of grad school
and interviews, last I checked,
you were all on the newspaper
editorial staff.

So, I guess this is just a case
ofchoosing the right battles, old
$811

If you want to encourage
social commitment, you should,
instead ofdcriding those who at
least make attempts, perhaps report on real social issues, local or
otherwise.

While 1 really enjoyed roday's major from page spread about
the SGA elections—Great covetagcliit didn’t really inspire me to
social action of that caliber you might expect. Your attempts to one
courage people are perverse.

The most egregious aspect of the
article is that you oicribe motive
to the proclter’s actions after their
arrests, account] them ofmere
ostensible tornrnitnien

Staff editorial on FTP protest was rash, illolgical and unwarranted

l’m appalled at rhe audacity of the
author of last week's editorial (“Sills
dent protest weak," March 3,2006) to
reduce the Victorias Secret protest of
the involved students to nothing more
than“ an afternoon outing to a local
mall," simply based on the fact that
they declined to comment to the paper
about their arrest and the subsequent
charges made to them by the local aur
thorities,

The author’s (hereafter 1eferred to
in secondrperson singular, you) main
argument is that their actions were
inconsistent w1th Grinnell students'
age-long “commitment to direct action
on behalfof the causes that they truly
believed in."

You correctly
report that they
“heeded the advice
of their lawyer and
declined to speak
to the paper." all the more eviden

What sense
would it have made to hire a lawyer ro
represent them on their behalf in the
eyes of the law, and not listen to his or
her advice?

By condemning their choice to act
according to the advice of their lawyer,
is the 1?ij suggesting that an open den
ﬁance ofa ceitiﬁed legal expert would
have been a better alternative>

It is a truly rash move on your
part, to overlook the most rudimen—
tary assumptions about the standard
of behavior, for the sake of satisfyt
ing our ideological puisuits; that we
Grinnellians act with Common sense.

You take the most biased stance
possible against the students involved
in this fiasco and distort the reader-
ship’s fundamental logic system to fit
your assertion.

Aren't you yourself guilty of mis—
guiding your frustrations at being un-
able to dCllVCl' what would have been
a headliner, solely because they were
iinw1lling to comment on their arrest?
Against their wishes, their names have
been given away, Their decd rm been
made public. Yet you antagonize these

which reported their protest

exact same sort of “cowardice" as these
students, openly criticizing them under
the collective nomenclature of “5ij

nity from resulting counterarguiuents
directed at you alone, as opposed to the
$83 staffas a whole?

How could you possibly have as
sumed that those whom you accuse of
”saciiﬁc[ing] rheir cause to preserve
their clean records, hoping that their
arrest would magically disappear with-
out a paper trail” were speciﬁcally con»

and job market prospects in making

Unless you do this, the “editorial"
section is nothing more than an avenue
for select members ofyour staff, under
the guise of a newspaper, to transmit
your biases on a pointed issue into a
community over which you own inves-

What are Grinnellians saying and thinking in prir
vatc? What does not get said out loud? That sociology
isn't a real major, that white males cannot get professor-
ships, that something really must be wrong with Islam
given the horriﬁc violence surrounding those cartoons.
Might we begin to talk about these issues as a com-
munity? What is the point of theorising how to think
differently if we fail to also act otheiwise and to relate
to one another in newer, better ways? Come Grinnell,
we are better than this. We are too smart to he so silly.
Let‘s set aside political correctness for the moment and
analyse the grounds for our paranoia and the basis for
out multiple assumptions. Let’s think together. Let’s
argue this out. Let’s have a chat. I, for one, feel it long
overdue.

Those that read them and appreciate th‘em, tell me,

be fine. But take this:"Chuck Norris recently had
the idea to sell his urine as a canned beverage. we
know this beverage as Red Bull." Cute Except that 1
drink it in place of Forum coffee to stay up and now
puke my guts out every time I chug one of these
down. Gross. Doesn't even matter if it’s a joke, now I
equate the taste of Red Bull with acidiﬁed piss. Not
that I've ever had acidiﬁed piss. I'm declaring a war
on those vagaries of lameness by putting Mr. Norris
to eternal sleep. No, wait a minute, “Chuck Norris
