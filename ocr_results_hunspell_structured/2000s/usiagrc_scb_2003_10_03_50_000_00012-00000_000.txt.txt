7:00 Finish eating, leave husband to Clean up dishes and
wash sheels; head on to content by the Drakensburg Buys'
Chair at the high school. Sit down next to former catcher
for my softball team; spend 20 minutes energetically trying
to convince her to run for my school board seat when my
term is up next September.

7:30 Concert begins; buys sing wonderfully. I remember
seeing them sing rust as wonderfully 5 years ago when
they came to Grinnell on a very hot day when the nun-air-
eouditiohed gym was over 90 degrees. Although the metal
folding chairs and the gymnasium henthes are not overly
comfortable, at least the temperature is bearable/1nd in a
(ouple of years we will have an auditorium with air
Conditioning to host such eventsl hooray for everyone
who voted for the bond issue!

10:00 Concert over; those of us who have volunteered to
host members of the chair or adults gather around; I take
home the conductor, Bunny, Whom we hosted last time.
We drive by the new dorm and he makes a not very
complimentary remark about. the 3»story glassed-in area
visible from 8‘“ Avenue. I explain how people in Grinnell
often use the word "different” as a pejorative: ”Welly I
guess that’s kinda different." We get home, greet Chris,
and go out on deck. Bunny smokes, we all have a heér,
and we talk about the weather, his home in South Africa,
and the joys and struggles of touring with 30+ 12» to 15-
year old buysa

11:00 Go to bed, ﬁnally.
