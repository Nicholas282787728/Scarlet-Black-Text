int DEVlN Ross

This past weekend, the Grinnell Col-
lege rnen’s swimming and diving team began
their season with two meets at University of
Chicago.The team tasted victory after swims
n-ling against both the host school and Lake
Forest. It was a narrow win against Chicago,
with a final score “1497144, but the Pies
neers dominated Lake Forest 165—55.

“we've been going to Chicago tor about
ﬁve or six years now," said Head Coach Erin
Hurley. “It was probably the best Chicago
weekend we’ve had top to bottom, from the
swimmers being prepared as far as taking
care of themselves and then racing ,6,
ally tough while they are
tired."

On the 1nd 'dual
level, Tom Lankic icz
’12 recorded victories
in the ZOO-meter and
SOO—meter freestyles,
and Cy Mistry ’11 won
in the 100* and 200*met
ter breaststrokes for the
swimmers. On the diving
side. Nick Smith '10 won
both the one and three-
meter events.

Smith attributed the team’s success to its
closeness. “Our team supports each other
more than any other team,” he said: ”That’s
a big component to our success."

The team has won the MWC Champit
onships for seven consecutive years. in the
2008 MWC Championship. the team again
rose to the top, bearing the second place
team by 194 points.

According to Captain Dan Neely ’09
there is a simple formula to their success.
“We take it seriously and try not to go into
it as ifit's manifest destiny," he said. "We all
work hard, really hard. We don't expect to
win. but we hope and try hard."

This year the team has been working
harder than previous years, putting in that
extra effort. “The training is really high
~quality right now," Hurley said. “we’re ask-

”We take it seriously and try not
to go into it as [Ms manifest

ing them to do a lot more every day, and
then race on the weekend. It's not only
challenging physically, but also challenging
mentally.”

The team has responded well to the high
energy training sessions, “There's a lot of
depth to the training." Mistry said, "Coach
[Hurley] does a great job of keeping us tae
percd. We make sure that we’re well rested
and that we keep our conﬁdence up."

Despite the challenges met, such as hav-
ing a smaller number ofteam members than
in previous years due to graduates and stuv
dents participating in studying abroad, the
team still manages to keep its spirit up.

“Right now there
are ten people abroad
and several swimmers
graduated last year,"
Smith said. “But the
ﬁrst year class is really
strong. The team has
only gotten stronger
and will continue to
get stronger."

individual goals
also add to the overall
success of the team at
meets and conferences
and often form an important part or the
team's psyche. “Thatway 1 know i am work-
ing towards something new,” Smith said. “I
don’t know who the competition is, Ijust try
to control howl do. I can't control how they
do at the conference."

Looking to the future. the team hopes to
win more MWC titles as well as recruit new
swimmers for the new season. But for now
the team is content with its members and
the success they have achieved.

“A team is only as successful as its team
members are. It takes that complete team
involvement." said Hurley. “When you have
a large team, if it’s in fractions. things aren't
going to go well. So it is a real challenge for
the team members to make sure everyone
is involved, and 1 think the team members
handle that very well.”
