xy how. and Hawkins comes to quickly show
us what a wonderfully charming character
Poppy rs

The frlm doesn’t have a srcrcotyprcal
plot, working instead as a character study for
Poppy by looking at a few chapters in her
life that test her unwavering sense of opti-
mism. We see her care deeply for Zoe, her
best friend and flatsmate of ten years (Alexis
Zegerman), her youngest sister who is just
frnishirrg college, and the kids she teaches in
her elementary school class.

But maybe Poppy cares too much. She
also can't help but feel for the cranky driving
instructor Scott (Eddie Marsan), her more
moody sister living in the suburbs, and, in
one scene, a homeless man she passes on the
street late one night.

The scene with the homeless man sounds
clichc‘ and really shouldn’t work, but it some
how does, While walking home one night,
Poppy hears a mumbled chant coming from
an alley. Her face lets us know that she’s a
little scared and uncomfortable (and she
even murmurs “What am I doing liereP“),
but she goes to investigate. There she meets
and strikes up a “conversation” of sorts with
a homeless man who doesn’t really speak in
words so much as sounds. They manage to
communicate, tlloughil’oppy really listens
to the man.

it's at this point in the frhn that it be
comes clear that Poppy is vcry much living in
the real world she 5 just chosen to (to through
lrfe opon engaged, and happy. Poppys ilatr
mate tries to lecture by saying that she, “cant
make everyone happy." But Poppy brushes it
offand replies, “No harm in trying, is there?"

HappysCo Lucky
{2008)

Poppy (Sally Hawkins), the protagonist
of Writer/Director Mike Leigh's “Happyr
Go-Lucky", seems to live in her own kooky
world. We ﬁrst meet her as she rides her

bicycle through the sir-cots of London with
a warm, bright smile on her race. She sces
a friend that she knows and her smile gets
larger and she waves. And then she does the
same thing to aim/wt friend that she hapr
pens to see. And then we realize shes waving
to people that she doesn’t know.

She pops into a bookstore and ehatters
to a disgruntlcd cmployee working there
who seems irritated by her sunny optimism
and the way that she laughs at her own jokes

(when she takes a book titled “The Road
to Reality" from a shelf, she quickly puts it
back, commenting, “I don’t want to be head
ed there, do 1?"). It’s hard to know whether
to side with Poppy (she seems sweet!) or the
employee (she seems annoyingl). Exiting the
bookstore. she finds her bike has been stolen
and qulps, “We didn’t even get a chance to
say goodbye" before movrng on.

How is this level of chcery exuberance
possible? Mike Leigh's out to show us earner-

Leigh succeeds in making Happy-Go-
Lucky both a funny and thought provoking
frlm l-lawkins won the Golden Globe for
Best Actress rn a Musical/comedy not only
for being sublimely funny (and Poppy is 1n:
[r11i17113),l)ut for showrng us a woman who, in
the sad and mixed up world were living in,
chooses to enjoy life and leave other people
smrling in the process. “HappyrGorLucky'”
is the defrnitron ofa feel good movie.

Giant cigarettes? Giant lipstick tubes? Bigger is better

A while ago 1 was looking at a pack ofMarlboro Reds and a
funny idea popped into my head.What if it was ten times bigs
get? What ifI made a gigantic box of Marlboro cigarettes using
papier-maché? It seemed Like the perfect medium for supersiz-
ing a cigarette box.

My mind raced. It jumped to the doughnut with the over-
sized cup of coffee seen as you enter Bob’s. Maybe I could add
to that After all, what

as accurate as possible.

While we worked, we began talking about the hilarity ofen-

We could makc a huge tack, a toilet, a port-o-potty or a key-

thing new, something simple and exciting.

Later on in his career, Old-
enburg became known for rec-
reating quotidian, mundane ob»
jects on a large scale and placing
them in various public places.
While browsing through image
es ofgigantic elothcspins, hams
mers and upturned ice cream
cones online, I was surprised to
ﬁnd a sculpture that looked familiar.

Where had I seen it’ I wracked my mind, then frnally gave
up and looked it up.Turns out that the “Crusoe Umbrella"l saw
is right here in Iowa, in front ofthe Des Moincs Civic Center.

Oldenburg’s art hits home in a very unique way for me, in
a way that l frnd kind of drffrcult to articulate. Wit s it that I
am so attracted to disproportionately large objects? Is it a humor
thing (Like it was with the oversized pack of cigarettes)? Does it

have political appeal? Surrealist appeal?

It’s a very simple concept, and its value has in its ambiguity
One can understand it and relate to it on an entirely subjective
level. All Oldenburg really does is blow up an object and plop it
in an unexpected space. He takes familiar objects and presents
them in unfamiliar settings.As he puts it, he strives to make art
“that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum" and
deﬁnitely succeeds.

“We don’t copy the objects we use, we try to transform them
and we hope they go on transforming as you look at themThc
idca ofendless publrc dialogue visual dialognrc very im»
portant to us," Oldenburg said durrng an interview about a 2002
installation in san Francisco. Oldenbrrrg's work playfully asks its
viewers to think about objects in a new way, devoid of the heavys
handedness that one might associate with contemporary artists.

I guess that silliness rs what I like about Oldenburg. To
someone else his sculpture might be more poignant, stultrfyrng
materialism in our day and age. To others it might be simply
inaneinot even worth a mention. Oldenburg's message is basi-
cally whatever you want it to be, meaning that the importance of
his work lies in the dralogue that it inspires between viewers.

Back in Grinnell we’ll continue to work on the oversized
cigarette box born as a joke, we’ll put it in Bob's or in some
other public space and see whether any conversations get start-
cd.
