return to winning ways.

The Pioneers went 2-2 in the Sunshine State but
won crucial center-once matches after coming home

longtime nemesis Lake Forest 7,0 in the morning
before handling Illinois College 6-1 that afternoon.

671 defeat ofnoneonfcrenee foe Simpson on Tuesday
at home

The wins gave Grinnell a 12-4 overall record, 270
l\lWC.T|1e record would have been even better ifthe
team hadn't split s games during
its spring break trip.

“We didn’t play tennis as well
as we would have liked evcr spring
break and dropped two matches to
teams I think we should normally
beat,‘ said Brij Patnaik 05.

“We, at leasrl went into Flori-
da thinking we would win at least 3
ofthe 4 matehcs,”said Rick Fenhert
‘06.

The team’s first loss occurred on .
March 21,when it fell to Hamline. Grinnell managed
to eke out only two victories in singles play, from no.
4 Patnaik and no.5 DJ. Warden ‘08. In doubles play,
as well, the team managed to notch only one victory,
which came from the no. 2 team of Fenbert/Warden.
The no. 1 team of Patnaik/Jordan Lee ‘08 lost in a
tight match, as did the no. 3 combo ofJUIian West
‘OB/Eli Best ‘07.

”The two losses we took in Florida
were good hetallse they allowed
the team to play (ampetl'tlve
matthes. We relish the thance to
play good tompetttion.”

The Pioneers were co-champions
of last weekend’s Hy-Vee Invitational
sorthauTournarncnt, bringing their re-
cord to 675.The Pioneers have won six
of their last seven, and with a talented
crop of first-years, the Pioneers have
high hopcs tor the
2005 campaign.

“The arsteycar
class is unbelievahle,"
said senior captain
Annie Beaman, who
was named the tour
narncnt’s Most Valu-
able Player. “They
make up more than
half of the team"——nine of the team's
15 players—“and will usually make
up at least halt of the starting squad.
There really isn't a weak position on th:
team.”

The improvement‘in this year's
squad was shown last weekend at the
Hy—Vee tournament, where- the women
split two games with the ﬁfteentlr
ranked Simpson college Storm and
trounced the Crown colicgc storm in
each of two games.

onship, which hasn’t been‘a completely
realistic goal for us in the past,” said
