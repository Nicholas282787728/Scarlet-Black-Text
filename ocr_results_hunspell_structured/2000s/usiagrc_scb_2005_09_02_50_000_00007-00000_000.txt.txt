WOMEN’S SOCCER

The women's soccer team enters the
2005 campaign following a memorable
2004 season. Head coach Heather Beli-
uing led her team to a Midwest Con-
ference Championship and a place in
the first round of the NCAA Tournnr
ment.lt was the team’s first NCAA ap-
pearance since 1999.

timc conference defender.

“We are looking to see a number
of first years make an impact on the
team this year," said Kate Diedtick YO7.
“We are returning seven starters from
last year and a number of people who
played in all 18 games who may not
have started.

The challenge began immediately
for the women's team, as they hosted
the defending Iowa Conference chamr
pion Loras in a 5 pm. game yesterday
Benning will now have more time to
prepare for the upcoming conference
season, which begins on Sept. 17.

Men's SOCCER

The men's soccer team is coming
off a rebuilding year after their ﬁrst
season under head coach Brian Jawot»
ski. With two overtime losses and four
losses determined by one goal each, it
was a difﬁcult and nerve—wtacking sea-
son for the Pioneers. Coach Jaws, as he
is know by his players, wiu look to im
prove upon a sale overall record from
last year and make a run at in Midwest
Conference title.

The men’s team will look to its 58,
niors this year for stability, leadership
and production. Gideon Erkenswick,
Kip Kelley and Lucas Houister are
expected to lead the team while lead
ing scorer Demitrio Rojas Aguilera ’08
will be counted on for another stdlar
season.

“As a team we haven't really sat
down yet to discuss what the ultimate
goals for this season are," said Erkens-
wick,“butl think they are still similar to
what we started last season.This is our
second year with Coach Jaworski and
so we are still very much set on giving
a new face and reputation to Grinneil
soccer. Obviously, everyone is dead set
on winning as many games as possible
but aside from that we think we have
the opportunity this year to become a
team that is seriously tight, selﬂess, and
has a lot of pride."

The quest began Thursday, when
the Pioneers traveled to Pella, Iowa to
take on Central college. They open
their conference play with a home game
against Knox College on Sept. 17.
