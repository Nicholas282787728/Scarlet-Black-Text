SGA to cut budget fer Board of Trustees

JRCA Usually the rich, old men who run Grinnell College
aren’t worried about their ﬁnancial security, But during their
ﬁrst meeting of the semester Wednesday night. SGA Jornt
Board made some tough decisions about funding campus
groups such as Concerts Committee, Equestrian Club, and thc
Board of Trustees. Largely due to the state of the economy and
Grinnell's endowment, the budget for Trustees will be cut ap-
proximately 23%, pending the ﬁnal vote ofJoint Board at next
week’s meeting.

The Trustees attempted to defend
their budget in front of Joint Board
as is customary, but were largely un—
convincing, even failing to provide an
itemized list oftheir expenses despite
being urged by many students to
open up their ﬁnances.

"You can’t really expect us to fund
a campus group if they won't even
open up their expenditures for re-
view," said SGA President Neo Mor-
ake ’09 ofthe trustees,who have been
a difﬁcult group to work with in recent years “But at least they

”You can’t real/y expect us to fund a
rumpus group ifthey won’t even open
up their expenditures for review But at
least they showed up this semester”

. Former SGA President Neo Morake’09

showed up this semester."

The Board ofTrustees, founded in 1843, is the oldest club
on campus~older even than the college itself, The original
members famously started the group
with only a single silver dollar on a
table, but rhnr modest sum has grown
into over one billion dollars for the
group. This has hurt the credibility of
their requests for funding, however, as
SGA noted that
their budget last
year was about
34,000 times
larger than that
of any other stun
dent group.

“They even have the added advanr
rage ofbeing the only group on campus
that gets some orrhcir ﬁmding from rue
ltion." said SGA Treasurer Emily Wax
’09. "The next closest thing I can think
of is when, three years ago, the Grinnell Prison Program tried

charging cigarettes for their classes at Newton Correctional
Facility” Wax added that the Trustees ﬁlled out their budget
forms incorrectly, after emailing her repeatedly asking her how
to dos o. “The instructions are on,
line, and they could have asked their
SGA senators."

The Trustees held an open
forum last night, continuing their.
tradition of pretending to actually '
give a shit about student opinions
once or twice each years. While a
few dozen students asked a hands
ful or questions and mostly left
early, they made a last-ditch effort
to defend what they do and why
they need money to do it. The meeting ended with a plea from
Trustees to students to bring the Grinnell College website up
to date after years ofcomplaints that students have not listened
to Trustee concerns rcgarding tcchnology, either,

SGA also voted to slash SGA’s budget this semester by a},
most hniratter SGA railed [D adequately defend their spending,
leaving SGA unconvinced.
