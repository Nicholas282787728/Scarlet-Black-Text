Arrests, fines
mar essential
student week

by SARAH MlltK 8c SARAH ERVIN

During the academic year, Grinucll's alcohol policy cmpha-
sizes responsible use and community support. But for essential
students who arrive on campus early, life for two weeks func-
lions under a stricter
policy. which bans all
consumption of alcor
hol on campus.

While admi 'ﬁter
tors believe the policy
is necessary and effec-
thC in creating a safer

campus during the
first weeks campus is
open, some returning students chute under rhc strictcr policy
and believe it has little impact on students’behavior.

But this yeat,t hree students faced real consequences for
violating the policy when they were arrested by the Grinnell
Police Departmentjust prior to the startofclasses. One student
was nrlcsted tor drunk driving and two students, including vice
President for Student Affairs Jim Koszewski '08, were arrested
for public intoxication.

After running 21-year-old Koszewskl through several son
hrieiy tests, the ofﬁcer arrested him public intoxication. Koszc-
wski spent six hours in a cell befotc being issued a court date
and released.

“It nus just a really stupid decision on my part,” he said.
Koszewski later met with his RLC and the SCA cabinet to
discuss whethcr he would possibly lose his vice president posit
tion,which he will not since no clause in the constitution states
an ofﬁcer can be impeached for such an arrest.

Koszewski’s arrest highlights one ofthe unintended censor
quenccs of thc essential student policy. Whrle the regulnttscr
sion alcohol policy defines clear guaidclincs for legal consump-
tion of alcohol on campus and emphasizes an atmosphere of
community enforcement of responsible drinking, the essenunl
studcnt policy is different in that it bans all campus drinking,
even by those oflegal age.

Delln ofStudent Lifejennrfer Krohn surd the polrcyrs a ba~
sic safety issue. “We don't have trained statron campus during
that week," she said. “No one is ready to work with the issues
that arise during the regular year regarding alcohol and drugs."
Before the policy was instated several years ago, Krohn said she
often had to leave staff training meetings to work with students
who had somehow violated the policy.

She also said while the policy may not completely srop ori-
entation \veck drink g, Student Affairs staff feels it has been
relatively successful as a plcvcntativc measure. “It clearly delinr
cares our expectations otstudcnrs," said Kmhn

Banning drinking, howcvcr, does not ensure that students

Students for seven ycars. Later he was promoted to vicc prcsie
dent of Student Services under George Drake, and has outs
lasted three collcgc presidents.

During his tcnuti: on campus, Crady has always been con-
corncd with the quality of student life, and as he prepares to
leave he says he is satisﬁed with the way his time has been
spent. “ vcryrhing l wanted to accomph, from a studtnr life
perspective 1 think I've accomplishcd," he said. “And that's im-

portant to mc I think the student life experience for students
today .. . is great."

The adminrstrators think he has accomplrshed a lot too.

‘Hes an excellent vice president, done a terriﬁc job here,” said
President Russell K Osgood “I would be glad lfhc hadnt [ac-
cepted thejob], but I’m supportive ofhim."

“We didn’t have a central focus and we didn't
