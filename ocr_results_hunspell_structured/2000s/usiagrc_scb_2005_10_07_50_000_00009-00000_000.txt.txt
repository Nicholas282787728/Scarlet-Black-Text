Abortion and its discontents

Recently I glanced at a poster on campus that con-
demned the collcgcs pro life group asbeing pro- -fris»
cist."Tliis follows along tradition ofAmericans using
the political epithet to compare groups and people
they disagree with to Hitler, Mussolini and Franco,
as ifsiicli a comparison were an argument for a posi-
tion.

But while it is easy to play the fascism card is a
means ofconstructing agoodrcvil dichotomy in a por
litical debate, it is by dcﬁnie
tion inappropriate to use in
the aboit‘ion debate. The
poster did get me thinking,
however, about thc prob
lems of abortion discourse
in this country.

Realistically. ilthough
no one may state it this
way, both sides in the
abortion debate base their beliefs on a common fundae
mentally liberal supposition that spheres ofindividual
autonomy, or individual '"rights, should be respected
For most taking a pro ~"ch0lce
position, the application of this
principle is roughly the protection
ota woman’s right of privacy to do
what she wants with her body and
anything that is part of it.

For most in the “prodife” perr
suasion, the individual sphere
applies to a fetus’ existence as well, meaning that a
pregnant woman should not be allowed to dispose
of it. These views in themselves, notably, have noth-
ing directly to do with beliefs in jingoism, one-party
political rule or the preservation of an oppressive sor
cioeconomic hierarchy, which are the common chars

actcristics ofdiffucnt forms offascism.

Dont get me wrong. lin not an advocate for kui‘ne
byryuh politics, where pic-liters and prorchoiccrs simr
ply agree to disagree and move on. The issue is more
important than that, But I think we've lost our focus
as'smdcnts and ethical thinkers on the abortion issue,
and the use of the term “fascist” to describe a group
with a reasonable position is a symptom ofthis.

We’ve allowed discourse in Grinnell (similai to

the country as a whole)

to be driven by debates

over the next Supreme

Dan Prignitz ’06 Court nominee (does

John Robclts believe in

AP"? 5 P017“ of View a constitutional right to

privacy») rather than by

the fundamental ethical

issues that are, appaiently,
too complex and ambiguous foi us to deal with.

Intellectual complexity, however, is not an excuse
for ideological ignorance. We should step back from
the current political debate and recognize that dif-

ficult ethical questions should be
resolved before we as a Socicty can
ratimiiilly make new laws regulate
ing or protecting the practice of
abortion.

One question is, does a fetus
really constitute a human indie
v-idual? This question unis resolved
constitutionally but not ethically in the majority opine
ion given in RM b. Mada, striking down state laws pros
hibiting abortion.

Justice Blackmun wrote in the majority opinion
that "throughout the major portion otthc 19th cen
tury prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer

fﬂtu/temital

than they air today [persuading] us that the word
person is used in rhc Fourteenth Amendment, does
not include the unborn.” So the Court did not try to
answer thc ctl‘iicill question of whether the unborn
would bnw rota recognized as individuals, only thc
constitutional question.

This has important implications for our current
national debate. Arguments for oi against abortion
rights do not merely rest on assumptions of the cone
stitutionality of the right of privacy, but on the as—
sumption oftlic fcrus as an individual oi not. This is
an ethical question as well as a legal one, so it can only
be dealt with in the forum ofpublic discourse.

our country, and even the intelligent students of
Grinnell, may not be preparcd for such a discourse,
as shown by this instancc of nameecnlling directed
against thc campus prorlife group. The views of most
individuals arc too rigid to allow coalcscing of ideas
and political compromise.

As intelligent individuals, however, we should rec-
ognize our ideological biases before closing our minds
to the possibility that perhaps our position is ethically
ambiguous, or even flawed. Anyone that believes in
the intrinsic value of pcrsonal autonomy cannot cat-
egorically say that a woman has no right to do what
she desires to something that is very much part of her
own body, including a terns. At the same time no one
should categorize a fetus as nonrhuman without first
defining criteria for humanntss, and having defined
these criteria, recognizing the possibility that other
harm) rapitnr already born do not at them,

My point is simply that we should try to recognize
the ethical ambiguity ofthe abortion issue and recog-
nize the logical ﬂaws in out own viewpoints, rather
than condemning the “other side" as evil or stupid.
Then, perhaps, we can have a real discussion.

Life and times of a Grinnell Jewapina

My father always told me, “Elena,I
don’t care ifyou marry someone who is
Black, Latino,Asian, etc. as long as he
is Jewish."

“Well great,”I thought. I am sure
there are plenty of Jewish Latinos out
there in Chicago.

Growing up, I wished I was Latina.
It would have made life a lot easier. I
Just didn't really FEEL Asian. I didn't
have straight thick black hair, I wasn't
a science genius and I didn’t like sticker
pictures and Hello Kitty notebooks.

And being Jewish didn't help my
Asian si ation either, especially with a
large Fili no family composed of mis-
sionaries in Thailand, pastors or scorer
taries at the Moody Bible Institute, who
attend church without fail every single
Sunday People sometimes just didn’t
connect that there were acmally Jews
out there who weren't "whitcfY

That and it's not like I have any star
rcotypical Asian features. I also found
it hard to belicve that I would fit under
the same category as the JAPS (Jewish
American Princess) of the nearby Chis

hair was down,I was Pucrto Rican.
thnltwas up,Iwas Mexican. And
in Grinnell, according to the woman in
the flower shop, I carried a Colombian
air about me. As a result, immersing
myself in Latino/a culture was easy.

Oh, it would have been so nice to be
Latina. Why have Klezmer when you
could have Salsa and Merengue.> Nonee
theless,I had to come to grips with my-
self.

NowI don't know about all the other
mixed kids, but choosing multicultural
organizations, especially in high school,
can be a challenge.

I didn't feel Asian enough for the
Asian American group. Hell, there was
no Jewish group, and as much as Iwnnt»

I felt more like a poser than anything

I was armed with a new

The reason
why i hadn't fully
embraced both
my Jewish and
Asian American
identities before is
because there didn't
seem to be a space to do so. When I
walked into a temple, it seemed as if I
had to leave that other part or me be
hind. The same stood for walking into
any Asian American function.

There was no space for an Asian
American Jew. Thus, my goal was, and
continues to be, to create and build that
space for not only Jews who identify as
Black/Asian/Latino but also for those of
us who don’t Just identify as one thing.

goes against the popular Jewish cultural
stereotype. However, after the guessing
game I usually go through with people,
they do see the Jew in mc.“0h,I see it,”
they say “It’s

So, have I

could say that
(althoughpeor

given me the space to express myself
both as a Jew and as a Filipina and it has
rurthcr heightened my awareness and
dedication to both the Jewish and Asian
American communities. Nonetheless,
that still hasn't changed my preference
for Latino guys.

On a side note,I have decided that
marrying a Jewish guy would be good.
A Jewish guy who knows how to treat a
woman is even better. But most ofall, ii
Jewish Latino who knows how to treat
a woman is best!
