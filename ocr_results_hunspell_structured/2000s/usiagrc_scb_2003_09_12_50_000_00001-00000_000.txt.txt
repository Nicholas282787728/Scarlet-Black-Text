The Grinnell Poliee Department gave 5 sepa-
rate alcohol-related citations to Grinncll students

lic consumption. Many consider this number une
usnnlly high In I ampus where srndenrs received
13 cimtions In 20021003, inviting speculation as
to how strict the Grinnell Police will be this year
about offrcnmpus parties and drinking.

“Studenm need to understand that they qtn’t
be In rrnnsirwnh open eenrsmers." snrd Dan for
Student Life Jen Kmhn. “Students need to think
And look out for their friends".

Most orrhe errerlons issued Saturday night 00
enrreri on High sr. nenr parties in rhe am and were
issued while studcntscrossed streets erh open con-
rsrners or while they sat on rhe sidewalks,

SnI-n iener ‘ose who Is oflcgal drinking :Ig:,
was cited while crossing 8th St, with an open beer
In his hand, thought rhe Gnnnell Police was hllrng
a quorn. "They wouldn't have been able ro give me
a maker ifl hadn't crossed (h: street." he said.

Jones, along wirh rhe orhersruelenrs who were
cited, sre sehrelnlrri to appear in court on Thurs.
dny. Jones said he plans ro eonresr rhe charges.

Anorher srudenrwho wisheel to rennin anony»
mom was cited while walking on High Street with
a beer in hand. He said the officers wuc polite but
gave him a bmathnlyur test without his consent.
The Cl[.t[i0n$ shocked him because he saw them as
inconsistent with the Grinncll Police Depaitment’s
rrarmenr oirleohel nse orienmpns. “All her y:nr
the ofﬁcers told us just to stand behind the side-
walk." he said.

Grinncll Poliee chrrrieely Matliei‘ly, askcdstii-
elenrs to be respeerrnl In each orher, rheir nerglp
bots in town and to the Grinn:ll community “We
want to work with the college," h: said.

Mathcrlcy also asked sruelenrs living on High
Srreer to be responsible when hosting pnmes by
not servrng minors nnd keepIng rhe none down.
Mnrherly said rhe eomplnrnr rhnr olrew polIee ro

Anion K-isc ’04, a High Street resident, saw
things differently. According ro Knsc, polIee hm
been Involved In regulating cvciy High Srreer perry
since rhe beginning orrhe year.

K15: said he and his housemates ”did every
thing [the police] asked" rhe night orrhe pnrry, he
said “It was as if they wcrc looklng tor a wry ro
ﬁnc us. "

Kase also said rhrr rhe polite origin-lily came re
High sneer as rhe result on domestic disrnrbnna
Ind rhnr they “Inst srnrreel giving people eirnrmns.”
He doesn‘t remember rhere being rhnr much ren—
siDn between the Gtiniitll Polite and college stil-
dcnts in the three years that he's been here.

“1 think rhey're rnrgenngeoilegesrnrlenrs right
now," he .itlded.

Both Kmhn and Mathcmly said Ihcrc would
be meetings with High Stiect residents man about
pnrries.
