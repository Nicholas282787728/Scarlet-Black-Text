Baseball team slumping

BV DAN HARDlN

After the comeback win against
William Penn University on March
29, the Pioneer baseball team has
cooled off. The team is its in its past
six games and L3 in MWC play durt

' ing that stretch. Over those six games,
Grinnell’s opponents have outscored
them by a margin of nine runs per
game to five.

In between the game against Wil-
liam Penn and the others was an 11-day
layoff during which rain and snow de-
layed Grinnell’s scheduled games. The
Pioneers then played a doubleheader
against Monmouth on April 9. In the
ﬁrst game, Grinnell took a 7-2 lead into
the eighth inning on the heels ofscvcn
strong innings from starting pitcher
Bo Brannon '07. He gave up just two
earned runs on four hits while striking
out seven Scots.

Gtmnell took advantage of seven
Monmouth errors to build the lead,but
the visitors from Monmouth were able
to take advantage of a young Pioneer
bullpen when Ryan Harris ’10 gave up
three earned runs in the eighth on a
baseStloaded double. Fellow first year
Chad Christoff relieved him and was
able to work out the bases loaded jam.
Grinnell then pushed the lead to 9-5 af-
ter taking advantage of two Monmouth
errors in the bottom ofthc inning.

Brett Maloney '09 came in to pitch
the top ofthe ninth, hoping to close out
the game. Maloney quickly loaded the
bases, and another double cleared them
to make the score 9-8. After an RBI
single and a balk, the game was tied
and Gary Kahn '09 relieved Maloiicy.
Another single and a home run put the
Scots up, 12-9, which would be the ﬁ,

nal score after the Pioneers were unable
to score in the bottom ofthe ninth,
The second half of the double
header ms a blowout, as starter Sam
Eaton '07 give up eight runs in 5 2/3
innings while Grinnell only totaled
five hits for the game. Rick Betdelle ’09
gave up four more runs en route to a
12,0 Pioneer loss that put them at 0-2
in conference play. The next day, cor-
nell College downed Grinnell, 12»2.

“The second Monmouth game and
the Cornell game were a direct result
of losing such a heartbreaking game"
said second baseman Robbie Unscll,
'08 of the first Monmouth grime. “lt is
really tough coming back from a loss
like that."

Grinnell suffered another heart
breaking loss last weekend in the
opener ofa doubleheader against Knox
College, Eaton took a 6t5 lead into the
ninth inning. but he gave up an RBI
triple and a sacrifice fly to give Knox
a 776 win,

This time, however, Grinnell was
able to bounce back from the tough
ﬁfsngﬂmC loss, scoring seven in the first
inning ofthe second game en route to
a 13b victory. Brannon picked up his
second win and Daniel Clark ‘08 went
376 with 6 RBI.

This weekend Grinnell will be cc]-
ebrating the 50‘h anniversary of the re-
turn of baseball to Grinnell with four
conference games at home against 11-
l.inois College and Knox college. “If
we are going to do what we want [to
do this season], we have to get it done
this weekend," Mendoza said, The ace
tion kicks otfsaturday at 10 am at the
baseball field.

Japinga defends rooting
for more than one team

Some of my friends have recently accused me of
sinning as a sports fan and have demanded immedi-
ate repentance. Apparently, a Cubs fan isn't allowed to
like the Detroit Tigers as much as I do,

I disagree, butI admit that my friends caught me
in a situation that showed questionable loyalty. In an
attempt to cover more of my white cement wall with
color,l decided to put up a panoramic shot ofMagglio
Otdonez hitting a walk-off home run in Game four
of the 2006 ALCS to send the Tigers to the World
Series. Unfortunately, I got caught testing out spots in
my room tor it, including one below my beloved Chit
cago Cubs poster. My heinous actions were quickly
stopped, and uowl often receive sarcastic comments
when I ask for aTigers score.

But when did cheering for a second sports team
become the equivalent of an extramarital affair? Felt
low Cubs fans out there can empathize with me when
I say that, by July, the last thingl
want to do is remain hopelessly
devoted to a team that struggles to
stay orit of last place.

Last year, more than any other,

l was given every reason to use my

best sports fan judgment and jump

on the Tigers bandwagon. The

Cubs were mired with injuries and setting up perma-
nent residence in the cellar, while the Tigers sat in
first place for the first time I can remember \Vork-
ing at home in Michigan last summer, I noticed that
many ofmy friends were talking about the Tigers in-
stead ofspeculating about the upcoming college foot-
ball season. .

Then the Tigers' playoff run solidified their “sec-
ond team" status I wore t-shirts and talked them up
I even bought tickets to the regrettably unnecessary
Game five ofthc ALCSt For a change,l no longer as—
sociated inysclfsolcly with the Cubs'“lovcable losing"
and or years without a World Series appearance,

It looks like I'll be asking about Tigers’ scores a
lot this season as loads of cash and the addition of
manager Lou Pinclla don't look like enough to carry
the Cubs into October. And seriously, $136 million
for Alfonso Sorianol Meanwhile. the Tigers return
nearly the whole lineup plus add Gary ShefﬁeldThis
is not a hard decisionil'm keeping my second team,
and 1 encourage all sports fans to consider one as well.
For those of you still undecided,l will present a few
guidelines to help the process:

rporrrﬂms hate. seriously, no one should want to win
so much that they pick a second team solely on the
basis of that team’s success. While the “second team”
principle exempliﬁes the sports fan’s need to cheer for
a team that might be doing better than his/her prie
rnary team, donning the Yankee pinstripes just to be
on a winning side is equivalent to seuing your soul
to the devil. So how can you decide which team to
choose? A good place to start is (0a..

to follow so as not to threaten your loyalty to your

referring to you.)
