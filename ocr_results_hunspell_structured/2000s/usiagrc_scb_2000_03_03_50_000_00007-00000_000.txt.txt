I’ll Hold the Coke, You Hold the Talking

By Courlney Houghom and
Aaron Slockhom

Big news in the land or make
believe. . ,courrrrey and l have been selected
to judge at tliisyear's prestigiousTrrular Head
festival. erile tlris isn't Cannes, we rake our
ﬁlm seriously So don't be submitting any
thing involving bodily ﬂuids. you can also
start sucking up to us now. llike expensive
jewelry and Aaron likes McDonalds. Just
giving some advance warning.

The Bone collector plays Saturday nigbr
at 7:30 somcwhere between bere and mere.
stars Denzel, Angelina Jolie, Queen latiran,
and rlre Bone Collector.

C: Aaron, before I start, I would like to
say two things to tire veryintelligenr people
that called me Saturday night. 1 m a prank
phone call should have minimum back-
ground laughter. 2 — iitlre only tiring mat
you had to do on a Saturday nightwas to sit
around reading the SBCB and bothering me,
that’s pathetic. Now that tlm's been said — I
have seen this movie, i think that makes this
3 or 4 weeks in a row. Go me. I thought
this one was pretty 0K. Tlte fact that Denzel
was the “Star" and he spends all of the movie
in bed paralyzed was a pretty interesting plot
concept.

A: Why do you get all the phone calls

expressing romantic sentiment? I’m so ical»

ous. Anyway, we get some cops here, chas-
ing a serial killer. Dcnzel can only move one
ﬁnger, and yet be srill leads Angelina into
the lair of this killer. Now, personally, I‘ve
never been a big fan ofmovies which spend
a majority ordreir time underground. We
get way too much sewer footage here But,
in what seems to be a theme from Hollyr
wood this year, we get another decent twist
ending.

C: What I liked about this movie was
rlrat people actually died. [know that sounds
awful, but there was no initial dramatic tes-
cue of the victim from the clutches of the
psycho Wbari did not like about rliis movie
was the kind otgtoss sexual energy between

neural and Angelina. That was rlie part or
tire movie that gave me the creeps, not the
aetual “thriller" part.

A: Courtney, rnat fascination with death
only leaves me with rirree words. Mental,
Health, and Center, Look into it.
