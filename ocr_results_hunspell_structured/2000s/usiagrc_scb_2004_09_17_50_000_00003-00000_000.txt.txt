Grinnell’s second L A. Posse
arrives on campus next
year will see ﬁrst i). C. Posse

av LOLA GARCIA

Every year students from big cities find the adjustment to
small town life in Grinnell a difﬁcult transition. But firstycar
Valentin Jiminez, from Los Angeles, Calif, has found the ads
justment pretty easy. “I like Grinnell a lot more than L.r\.r
that’s for surc,“ho said. “It feels more like home."

To Jimenezy home rs where he was born in Guanajuato,
Mexico, a farming area in central Mexico that he still visits
once or twice a year. When he was four years old hrs family
illegally immigrated to the United States. His father, a bra:
rem—a farrnhand—was eventually oﬂ’ercd legal status in ex-
change for working longer hours for less pay than farmhands
already living legally in the states. “[My father] was cheap in-
bor, but it was better than what we had,” said Jinrincz.

“l was born in Mexican farmland," he said. “The only rea-
son 1 dont live there now is because of the lack of oppor
tunity.” Now, J‘rminez and nine other first years have more
opportunity than perhaps they ever thought possible as the
second class of Posse scholars to come to Grinnell.

While Grinnelrs involvement in the program began only
last year, the Posse foundation was founded in 1989 by 24-
year-old Deborah Bial, who conceived of a program that
would allow students from underprivileged backgrounds to
graduate from College.

In 15 years,Possc has extended 585 million in scholarships
to over a thousand students.This year 223 scholars will enter
22 colleges, Posse offices currently recruit students in Los An—
geles.l New York Boston and Chicago Next year will he the
inaugural class ofPosce scholars from Washington D. c. ,and
Grinnell will get a D. C. Posse as well as an L. A. Posse for the
class of 2009.

President Russell K. Osgood helped select the Posse stun
dents that have come to Grinnell and speaks highly of the
program. He told the LA Timer that the Posse program was
Grinneil‘s attempt to recruit, but also retain, “diverse stu-
denrs."“one ofour interests is...having a support structure so
they will stay here and graduate," he saici.

Posse is quickly becoming one of Grirrncll's most effective
tools in recruiting multicultural students. Of the ten Posse
students in the class of2008. five are Latino, four are black
and one is Korean-American. Of the 12 students in 2007’s
Posse class, eleven arc multicultural students.

In four years, Gririncll hopes to have so Posse students
on campus. If they reach this goal, about five percent of the
student body will come from the Posse Foundation.

Last year, the class of2007 had 12 students from the L.A.
Posse and all of them have returned for their second year.

Posse scholars face a rigorous selection process before re
ceiving their 530,000 per year scholarships.

Jessica Starling ’08 was nominated by her high school
counselor for the scholarship. She and 415 other nominated
students attended an initial meeting; Starling and 74 others
wcr-e invited back for a group interview. After that, 30 stu~

dents made the ﬁnal cut and were passed along to selection
committees at Grinnell, the University of Wisconsin and
Claremont-McKenna. Each committee selected the students
that would make up their Posse.

After the students are placed in their posse, they begin an
eight-mouth training course to prepare them for their college
careers. "It's basically a crash course in how to survive col-
lege,"said Starling.A large part ofthc training is a writing lab
which covers rcseareh,papor organiz ion and how to develop
a thesis.“That is to sprucc up ourwriting skills,"sriid Starling,
who claims she has already used the skills she learned from
the writing lab in her firsrrycar tutorial.

Part of the Posse Foundation’s objective is to find students
who do not have the traditional makerup ofa potential cola
lege student. Often Posse students do not have the GPAs or
the test scores of other students admitted to their institution,
and the Posse preparation period is cicsrgned to help them
along.

"it also teaches how to get along with people," said Star-
ling Many of the Posse students come from minority-heavy
schools, and the prep course focuses largely on how to adapt
to schools like Grinnell, which' is 73 percent white The idea
bchrnd sending posses was to have a group ofstudents who
were able to relate to and support each other in the college
environment. lts helped a lot," said Starling “Its basically
like a support group

Mary Chang o7 expressed a similar viewpoint. “All in all 1
do feel like the Posse program helped me to adjust here,"said
Chang, a member of last year's Posse. “We knew each other
frrst," she says. “We are like a family here...we basically grew
up together."

This year's Posse students are equally close. Jiminez drove
from L.A. to Grinnell in a rworday jaunt with fellow posse-
mcmbers Lauro Franco '08 and Evelyn Gander“ ’08. “You
can’t do that with just anyone,"he said about the trip.

Other Posse members also expressed gratitude for the
support system the other students provide. Danny Zamora
‘08, like Jiininez, was born in Mexico. He lived in Veracruz
until he moved to East Los Angeles in March of 2001. “It
was pretty hard, leavrng behind the life i had been 'in for 17
years,” he said. “It is like that when you come to college. You
leave behind your old life and start from scratch." Zamora
said the Posse program functioned as a bridge connectron his
old and new lives.

Zamora is relishing his new life in the middle of lowii.
“I'm so excited for the monarchs," he says of the upcoming
butter-fly migration, “I’ve never seen one before, and 1 can't
wait."

Zamora has already become actively involved in college
extra curriculars.“l'm gay, and I am so proud of that,"said the
new member of StoneCo. He has become a part ofthe Inter-
natio i1 Student Organization and the student organization
of Latinos, is a production assistant in the drama depart-
ment and will be the props manager for this fall's performance
of err Merriam. He is also putting together his own campus
group: XOCHIPILLI, a Mexican folkloric dance group.

“I’ve already started calling my dorm home,"said Zamora.
“I cannot think of anywhere better to be in this tune of my
life than Grinnell.”
