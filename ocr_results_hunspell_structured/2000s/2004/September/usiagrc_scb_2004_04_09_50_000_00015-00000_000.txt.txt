Evenly-matched.

by Aly Beefy

Pristine weather and supportive home
court spectntors weieiit enough for the
Central College tennis team inst Tuesday,
who fell to Grinncll in a Hall-l)l[lIIg/l-3 loss.

“Th match was the hlggest rest ottlie
season g g into conference," said John.
\‘Vest ‘06, “It’s an Iowa team with ability
that closely matches our own."

Eli Best‘o7 agreed “[Cential is] one of
our higgest non-conference rivals,“ he d,
tompai inthiesriay's tale to last weekend's
sweep of Lake Foicst and lilinois Colleges
where Grinnell “absolutely dominated"
their opponents in two 7-0 Victories.

Unlike last weekend, almost all of the
matches against Central were right In tact,
Bin Patnaik ‘05 was the only player to tie
teat his opponent in nto straight sets OH»
4 and 76.

“After the match I felt fulﬁlled,” said
l’atnaik, more conteinplatlte thnn boi ct.
ous about his win “I felt as if my manir
tested superiority had completed my eons
eeption otinyselr,"

Patnuik’s victory hecame more iinpot.
tant after thnnell’s top two doubles teams
ﬁltered, causing them to lose the doubles
point.

“lfyou win the doubles point, all you
have to do is split the singles," said Best. “If
you lose douhles, you have to seriously pile
lage [the opponents] in singles,“

Gtinnell didn’t exactly “pillage” in
singles, hut managed to take tour our of
six, often against strenuous opposition. Best
and West fought their way to victories at
the two and two spots, :ach dominating his
third set after splitting the first two.

“The thing about my style of play is
that I don't knock anyone off the Court. ..
it comes down to who’s going to last longer
physiesily," said host. “may opponent] hit
a wall in the third set. It was awesome.”

BcSt’s and West’s victories tied die match
at 3-3. leaving Shlhan Abeygunawzrdana
‘05 as the last man left. With his teammates
watching, Aheygunawsrdene took the do
cisive match from Central’s David
Brondyke 7-6, 2-6, 6-3 to secure the vic-
tory.

Though rightfully proud about their
herdeatned triumph, the Best Western
tmmmates admitted that the match was not
one Gnnnell approached wrtli hlg heads.

“We pulled out a victory in a right
match," said Watt,

“At no better time With Conference
approaching,” added hest.

today is tlolible shots fioin trees, ditches,
etc, Wednesday will he focus on long irons
