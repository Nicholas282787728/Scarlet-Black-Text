I chose to be an English major very early in life,
While all the normal children were watching Sui/ct!
By The Bell, 1 was reading books. This means that
there are a vast number nfcultura] references that ev»
eiyonc in my generation understands except me, and
I have had some pretty awkward moments over the
years. Brit, c'est la vie. At least I can converse intelt
ligently about the Babyrii‘lur't Club.

The problem is,1’m not just an English major, I'm
also a senior. and I'm terriﬁed. because after graduat
tion they don’t let you be an English major anymore,

After graduation, you are srrpposcd to go into
the Real World and do UsefulThings. I thought
college was supposed to prepare me for that, but
strangely, none of the job listings 1 have looked
atlist“Abrlity to Identify larnbrc Perrtarncter”as
one of their top priorities in employees.

in stubborn, though, and I'd rather spend
a lifetime carting around a copy of Tie Noi—
tan/17111111109 ofErlglirh Lil. V0liime1(which,
for those of you unfamiliar with it, is
a book that could kill even the most
Kafkrltcsque of insects) than just let i
four years of extreme academia slide
out ofmy mind the moment I start making money.

or course, that may never happen, (the money
patt.i mean),but in any case,i really feel that l ought
to put my literary knowledge to some sort ofuse. That

Last hurrah as English major

is whyl have decided to write this column; I want to
provide all you noannglish majors with a little id-
vice,just in case you decide to pick
up a few extra Humanities credits
or something,

First of all, English class is
unlike most other academic dlSCi'
plines, because most otyour read»
ing is not about things that actur
ally happened.

While all ofyoui History Mir

» jot friends are woirying

about how the legislative branch of the US,

government dealt with the economic situr

ation of the 1930s, you get to read about

Frankenstein's monster, or the passionate

love affair ofCatherine and I-lcathclifi’,

Were there any gruesome creatures

made of corpsc fragments hang

ing around the Oval Office with

FDR? Has anyone ever come back

from beyond the grave to put bills
through congress> i think not!

Ofcourse, sometimes the things
you read in English classes are not quite as straight—
forward as History. lfyou’re really not good at inter-
preting symbolism or reading between the lines. here
are a few pointers to get you started: 1) In a lot of

 

Were there any gruer
some creatures made

hanging around the
Oval Office with FDR?

situations, things in books represent sex. 2) In other
books, particularly older ones, things are more likely
to represent God. lfyou really can’t
figure out what something syme
bolizes, God and Sex are two good
guesses.

The main theme or overall lesson
ofa book can be tricky to identify, but
helpful in understanding the hook II’
self. One rather common theme can
be found in a wide variety of novels,
including novels about adolescence,
novels- about love, novels about wai, and novels about
Russia.

This theme can be slimmed up with the words
"Life sticks." of course. some literary works have
slightly less depressing morals, like [rule Eyre (Baby-
sitting is hard work), [VIII/wring Hog/yr (Don't fall in
love with a scary devilish man and then marry your
cousin.) and Romeo mid fit/[1'] (When you are having
problems in your love life, the last person should ask
for help is someone who has taken a vow of celiba-
c ).
y For those of you with several years of academic
insanity ahead ofyoii,i urge you to take as many Eng
lish classes as you can, Contact me if you need any
help with your homework. I’ll be catching up on some
Sea/ltd By The Bell reruns.

Columnist sends greetings from London

There are over 20 Grinncllians who
have embarked on a semester abroad
in what some have called the safest
Study abroad program out there Grin-
nelltintLondon.Undcr the umbrella of
the usual Griiinell bureaucracy, profess
sors, and rich programming, we aren't
even grappling with another language
(though the odd vocabulary that the
English seem to use might prove othr
erwise — three quid to buy a programme
to read during interval at a studio with
no lift, tiny loos and no place to hang
your brolly),

Nevertheless, being strangers in a
strange land always allows for interest-
ing stories to relate, i mean, we've all
come from the common background
of Grinnell College, but what about
our differing experiences with cities or
travelling abroad?

And the small groups living in flats
or houses together might have provided
for interesting fodder for the entrepre—
neurial reality TV producer looking
for the next big hit: Twenty»:ome odd
people picked to live in London, learn
about a country entirely more full of
history than their own, and given free
theatre tickets to over 12 plays; this is

the story of what happens when the
British are always polite but can't stand
our political leaders. Quite catchy rer
ally; I’d watch it.
but alas, there is no camera crew,
only a ridiculouvmindcd girl, never
before offof the North American cont
tinent, to report to you what we are get—
ting up to here in the british Ein-
pirc.1t really will be jolly good
fun. How could it not be?
London has already
given us cause for near , ,
heart attacks in try
ing to cross the street
where pedestrians
hold no riglitrotr
way over the tons
of metal and rubber
barrelling down on
us from the bloody
wrong side of the
street — unless we
happen upon one of
the sacred animal crosswalks.
Apparently Pelicans are the patron
saints of light-controlled intersections
and zebra crosswalks (pronounced
Zehrbra, not Zeetbra you uncouth
American) seem to have given their

markings to the ivliite»striped walks
where just one foot in the crosswalk is
supposed to stop oncoming trafﬁc (but
rarely does).

Furthermore, how could you not
want to hear about the 25 minutes det
lay on the underground train (called
the “Tube") where we stood, packed

like sardines, continually checking

out watch and wondering how on
earth we would make it to the
class we had left the house an
hour in advance for?

Clearly, interesting tales
await you while you grumble
about the distance from

Harris to your dorm.
And last but not least.
we hold an entirely unique
role in our place in Grin-
nclltintLondon this
fall. Not only is this
the first semester we
will try the highly
controversial Fall and spring program
combination,hut we are also thousands
of miles away and still cannot escape

the idiocy of good ol'Dub-ya.

Unlike Americans, the English

are not oblivious to the world around

random What a Trip, Part III: I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!

them and are not afraid of printing
seven pages (including the front page)
in one of their top newspapers about
the statistics of Bush‘s terms, to write
countless articles about the Republican
party becoming a corporationrdriven
cesspool of nonsense, and to say rather
emphatically, that anything that the
UK seems to be doing wrong is bring-
ing them that much closer to being
like the United States ofAmerica, Her
Majesty forbid.

So while you face the pit where
Darby once stood, prescribed antirvirus
programs from ITS and the new smoke
ing policy, just remember your peers
in London (and the countless others
studying off campus this tall) and real-
ize we've got our own headaches too,

i mean, how can we possibly decide
injusr four short months what pubs are
the best to enjoy the freedom ofdrink»
ing legally under 21?

Or what freetadmission muses
ums to see next weekend? Or whether
we should eat at the Japanese Noodle
House, lndinn Curry buffet, or just
cookat home? indeed, life here is going
to bloody hard.

After all, com-
plaining in a pub-
lic forum is always

more fun than

doing it alone.

Saturday night I passed out on the bathroom
floor butt naked. After only a quarter of a beer,
Do I have the tolerance of a Japanese lady beetle?
No! It's not my fault at all! Ijust forgot to take
my medicine, sleep and eat! OK, so maybe it is my
fault. But at least I have friends who had exactly
eight months to prepare for this happening again

So, Emilia freaked out and started screaming and
Erin worried about packing clean underwear for me
while others, who have no idea what is going on,
liberated me from the shower stall. The paramedics
had not learned either and still got pissy when I
didn't know what day it was.

So offI went to the Grinnell ER where I spent
four long hours trying to make my blood pressure go
up and down an the monitor while Jen Kmhn talked
to the boys about football and Emilia and Kelly Ann
picked out hats from the Cancer catalogue. Aside
from Thomas’ rather delayed discovery that animal
crackers can be placed in compromising positions,

it’s safe to say that I was the most exciting thing
that happened at the Grinnell Regional Hospital
that night.

Eventually, they let me go home with a "resporh
sible adult" My friends so didn’t make the cut: i
think the nurses saw theanimal crackers. When I
finally got back to my room the next day, I found
that Aly had bought me my very own day—of—the
week pill box. Iswear I’m not an old person. My
ribs and knees just hurt because shower stalls are
not kind to seizing students 50 what if Emilia has
to listen when I’m in the shower and four different
people call me in the morning to remind me to take
my pills? Fine. 1 have become a 85-year old within
a week. At least I didn't break a hip. And at least
I can tant for two columns since I still managed to
churn out two art pages for today, and well, cuz I’m
dating the opinion editort

Dear Grinnell College Campus,

As of Sept. 25, the FaulCUner Gallery will have
been open for five full years Vet just about every
week, I receive a message, or read an article, or
spot a notice about the gallery in which the name
is spelled Faulkner. It is time the entire campus
had a wee spelling lesson, as well as a lesson in
honoring our beloved donors. The Gallery is named
for Vernon Faulconer of Texas, an alum of this
ﬁne college Mr, Faulconer is alive and well and
still comes to campus at least once a year. He is a
great guy—you would all like him. The Gallery is
not named for William Faulkner of Mississippi, To
my knowledge, Mr, Faulkner has never been here
even in spirit form, So please correct your ad-
dress hooks, check your directories, ﬁx your spell
check, notify your editors and from now on spell it
FAULCONER.

ilesley Wright,
director of Faulconel Gallery
