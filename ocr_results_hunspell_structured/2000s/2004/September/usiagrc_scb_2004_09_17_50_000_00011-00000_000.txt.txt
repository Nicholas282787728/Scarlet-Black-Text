Tran ‘06 who trans
ferred from Grins
nell, Betsey Root 06_
describes the team as
incredibly enthusir
astic anti coheswe,"
These traits undoubtr
edly aided the team in
its impressive victories.

The Pioneers’ top 3 doubles teams
remained unbeaten on both days, Im-
pressive play came from the No. 1 dou-
bles team ofJill Harms ‘05 and Camilla

and Illinois College counterparts 8-2
and 8-1, respectively. on Sunday, they
teamed up again and easily beat Be»
loit 8-1. In a similar fashion, the No.2
doubles team, comprised otsrstcrs Sid
Khnjuria ‘05 and Shweta Khujuria ‘07,
beat Carroll 8L3 and IC 8»0 on Satur»
day and won again

playing in the No,

won all three of their
matches too, with
scores ofssi, 870 and
870 against Carroll,
Illinois, and Belort

head coach

respectively,

In singles play, too, the team did
not lose a single match. Against Illinois
college on Saturday, their opponents
did not manage to score more than one
game per match. In fact, Shweta Khaju-

KAT PICKENS

ria, Alarcon, and Margaret Block ’06 all
won their respective matches without
their rival even getting on the scores
board. The Carroll ream offered more
resistance, but the Grinnell women still
won five of rhcir six singles marches,
on Sunday, they completely obliterated
the Beloit team, All six of the Gtinnell
women soundly trounced their oppm
nents, allowing them to score a total of
only two games out ofsix matches.

To their credit, Coach Barbara
Waite cites that “they worked vory
hard throughout the two hot days and
their erorts paid offwlth three decisive
wins."

Looking ahead, the team returns to
action on Saturday, Sept. 18.They will
play Knox and Monmouth as well as
Lake Forest, the defending conference
champion. The week after that, they
will be at the ITA Regional Tourna-
ment where they will hope to avenge
their sole loss of the season to Cornell
