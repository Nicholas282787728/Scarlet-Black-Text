by Saurabh Saraf

How did you learn to “stop worrying and love glo—
balization"?

Well. lwasplayingalinlebir. bucalororpeople
who are anxious about globalrrarion overesnmare its in
ﬂuence, wharever bad rhings happen ro rhe economy.
Talking about the U.S. and other rich countries, a lot of
what happens depends on domesrie insrirurions la-
bor laws, unions, ﬁscal policy. things like that. Classic
rhings. Capiralisrs say rhar rhe world is very inrerna—
tionalizeds but to some measure the 1970: war: more
internationalized than we are now. I bclicv: in the
free movemenr or people and ideas. There is a deep cul-
tural conservatism In a lot of pcople [about] cultural
purity. That makes me a little nervous because it [seems]
a bit xenophobic

we’re ralking abour globalizarion, whieh is a very
clumsy word, and I’m not sure what it mean: in a lot of
eases.

You’ve said globalization isn’e the same as imperi—
alism, but wouldn’t you say imperialism often leads to
globalization, and is oieen a prerequisite?

Well, in a lor orrhe poor counrrics orrhe world.
over the last 20—25 years. we've seen a move rowards
whar orthodox people call “liberalizarion,” but chars

The power and rhe agenda are more scary rhan rhe g.

Are you concerned abour rhe Concentration of
power in rhe hands ofa few?

Large corporations cerrainly have
a rremendous amounr oiweaIrh and
power. and that's not a good thing.
The problem is that with rhe world

You said a lot ofcountries dont have the option of

izatian has more beneﬁts than drawbacks?

litical, cultural, technological alliances.

What's your opinion on grassroots movements vere
sus a toprdown approach to development?

They have re eommunieare wirh
each orher and exchange ideas. 1
rhink purely local movernenrs
[aren't] going ro have rhe economic
and political power to make rhe
ﬁght. That dichotomy between rope
down and borromeup doesn‘r need
ro exist [if] people ralk ro each orher.

Do you think rhar globaliza-
tion, while allowing a free mover

cal hegemonics?

The downside oicoursc, is rhar
ir's an unequal exchange; mobility [may proinpr] mi-
grarion from one bad siruarion ro anorher. But ir also
allows more linkages among popular forces around rhe
worldipolitical ries, morepolirical spaces. I done think
ir's desirable ro go back ro narion srares wirh inviolable
Iimirs.

Would you advoeare more globalimtion?
Yes, iFit [allows] for equal exchange.
