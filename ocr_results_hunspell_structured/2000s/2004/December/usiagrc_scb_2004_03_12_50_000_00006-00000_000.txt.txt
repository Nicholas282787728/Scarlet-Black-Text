questionnaire

The CAGE Questionnaire
was developed in 1970 to
screen patients tor
alcoholism.

0 It consists of four
questions. Two or more
positive answers can
indicate a positive history
with alcoholism

‘ Physicians often use this
guestionnaire with their
patients. Once completed,
it becomes part ot a
patient’s medical history
' The validity of the
questionnaire is
undermined if it is
presented after a patient
is asked about the amount
ot alcohol ingested

' Therefore, the
questionnaire should be
asked ﬁrst, followed by
questions regarding the
volume of alcohol
consumed

Seeking help at Grinnell

by Josh Cooley

At die end orlasr semester. thcAlcoholim Anonymous
meeting that was held on Saturday nights in the lounge ot
the Chaplains Omcc disbanded due to poor attendance,
But a group of actively recovering Grinnell students took
the initiative to run their own meetings.

They created a studenr.lcd AA group that has met every
Monday night in Steiner 305 at 7:00 pm. Over die past dc-
mde, student-led AA groups have come and gone from the
rampus. but die student leader otdre current moetings hopes
die group will continue in Steiner tor several years to come.
The group will continue to meet through ihe end or the so.
mester.

New beginnings

The original Saturday night group was implemented
by a community member who, artcr undergoing treatment
at the New Beginnings Recovery Center in Newton, made
a yeardong commitment to sponsor an open AA meeting
on Grinnell’s campus. The group
started meeting during the second so.
mesrer otlast year, though New Be.
ginnings had contacted Grinnell or.
lier in the aadcmic year. Beans: there
was a lack otstudenr initiative in cre.

Krohn took New Beginnings up on

an AA meeting on mmpus. At that
time. inerasing the availability otsup.

pccially important. Last year, there
were 15 use: where students were hospitalized for alcohol
overdoses, a signiﬁcant increase over the six cases during
the 2001-2002 academic year,

New Beginnings was founded in the spring ot2001. in
nepouse to the lack ota naideno'al treatment center tor snr.

New Beginnings is not solely a residential treatment
center, it offers outpatient services as well According to
Randy Myers, the director otNew Beginnings, a typical

College intervention

Both students who are arrested for alcohol or drug-
telatad oﬂenses and students who are hospitalized for an
overdose must meet with eidmer Kmhn or the Hearing

"If people need treat-
ment, I want to make
sure they get it. My goal
is not to be punitive.”

Board, a panel composed otsrudents and faculty. The sru.
dent undergoe an evaluation to determine if he or she
needs treatment, costing around $90 at the student's err.
pense, Krohn stressed the importance orsrudcnrs ropond.
ing honestly during the evaluation. “it people need treat.
ment, 1 want to make sure they ger it," she said. “My goal

The college relies heaviiyon this evaluationandiusub.

studenn who have addiction seek recovery. When students
are hospinliaed or arrested more than once. as has been
the case with at least one student every year tor the past
tour years, the college doles out serious consequences, ac.
cording to Ktohn.

When the results otrhc evaluation demo that students

age a student who has not been arrested or hospitalized to

undergo a voluntary evaluation it they believe the student

has a subsranoeabuse problem, but it is ultimately up to

the studeno whether or not they will acknowledge their
addiction or seek treatment for it.

“There's a student whom I’ve addressed many times,"
said Mandy Fox, Residence Life Coordinator and Interim
Housing Director. u[I've told them], ‘l think you smoke
too much pot. 1 think you smoke pot tor the wrong rea—
sons. 1 think that your poisrnoking is hindering your aca.
demic performance. 1 think you rely too much on pot.
smoking as a social activity,’ But that student has never
sought treatment."

Statistically, Grinncll's documented substance abuse is
lower than the national average among coucge studenu.
But iis percentage otstudcnts who binge drink talls only a
tow points below the national average, and its pot usage
rates are higher than more or the national average. But
comparing crinnell's substance abuse rates to those of its

. peer institutions is difficult. Many students seek addiction
recovery through self-motivation and self-decision, or seek
help independently ot Grinnell. rather than attending an
actual treatment program associated with the college. Try.

Fox. “In a college environment, in dirticuli to tease out
the dieterences between havinga [substanceusel habit and

“We're not spying on them to go and seek the treat.
ment they need," said RLC Travrs Wilson.

over the past several years. studenn have been relying
more and more on the RLCs to deal with issues related to
alcohol, During the 2000.2001 academic year, the RLC:
were only miled 14 (lmm to deal with alcohol incidents.
but lasrycar they were called 35 times.

Wilson believes that the increased role RLC: arc play.
ing in dealing with alcohol incidents does not mean that
the RLCs are becoming alcohol police orviolatingseltgov.

bets." he said. Krohn agreed wrrh Wilson. "Part otselt.
governance is understanding and knowing state and red.
eral laws and abiding by those," she said.

According to Wilson. RLC: orten don't have to be the
first to contronr studenrs about substance abuse. because
the friends otstudenrs wrrh substance abuse problems or.
ten seek the advice oran RLC.

Fox has found this to be the we as well. “Most stu.
dents will come to us and say, ‘1 don’t want you to say or
do anything, but give me hints and tips on how to deal
with this,” she said "we play mostly the role those individual
studenrs having romance abuse problems want us to play,"

Underelassmen students actively recovering trorn sub.
sranceabuse problems will have the added beneﬁt othav.

noted. however, that It’s important “not to assume that all
these students will want to live in smith," and that these stu.
dcnrs will not get prioriiy in roomdmw ovcr outer snidenrs,

Support systems

This year, despite the increased number of drug and
alcohol-related arrests, fewer students have been evaluated
tor substance abuse problems than in past years, Though
die college has not strongly considered hiring a drug/alto.
hol counselor to help students, Krohn believes that stu-
dents who make the commitment to substance abuse re.
coverywrll have ample support from other the administra-
tion. New Beginnings, the Chaplains, RLCs, SAs and other
actively.recovcring students.

For additional support. AA groups meet at st. Paul's
Episcopal Church on Tuesday and Sunday at 7:30 pm.
and Thursday at 3 pm. Narcotics Anonymous meetings
are held at 7:30 pm. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday ,
at the Clubhouse. lnmtcd on the corner of Third Avenue
and Pearl Street.
