This week, signs proclaiming that students
are officially boycotting Coke products ape
peared iu the dining halls and on Coke mar
chines around campus. Dining Services put up
the signs are a resulr of rhe Nov. 19 round of
student initiatives, but action on most student
initiatives won't begin until next semester.

While student initiatives are non-binding
actions, if an initiative is passed, seeing that rhe
will of the students is carried out becomes the
responsibility of the SGA President. Usually,
the president starts following up on student ini-
tiatives the following semester.

The “Get Coke of Campus” initiative was
sponsored by Students against Sweatshops and
the Latin American Solidarity (LAS) group.
Linda Wells ‘05, a member of LAS, was ini-
tially concerned that the initiative wouldn’t pass.
Hearing that it passed with 70.1 percent of the
vote left her pleasantly surprised, as has the co.
operation from Dining Services in response to
the initiative’s success.

“This is still the choice of individual stile
dents," said Dick Williams, ditecor of Dining
Services. At this week’s Joint Board meeting,
Williams said that the college would not break
its exclusive contract that the college has with
CocarCola Company. While he pointed out
that they could break the contract, it would cost
the college considerably, including reimbursing
Coke for the card swipes on Coke machines.
Williams said he is currently exploring ways
to have Coke alternatives on campus without
breaking the contract.

While the official boycott will not change
the contract, Wells said that that was not the
point ofthe initiative. ”We want to emphasize to
the campus what this boycott means," she said.

will buy less Coke products." While the college
has an etclusive contract, Dining Services still
decides the quantity of Coke products they will
buy based on consumer demand,

Results of the most recent round of voting
were released to students on Nov. 21,. tcr some
confusion. SGA Administrative Coordinator
Mike Maloney ‘05 explained that there was
some ambiguity in the SGA Constitution, and
it could not be precisely determined if one rhe
initiatives passed.

Initiative one, sponsored by Clark, Rawson
and Langan Senator Ryan Felton ‘07 received
65.8 percent of the vote with 3.7 percent un-
answeredThe SGA Constitution requires that
at least 50 percent of the student body vote on
initiatives and that a initiative needs 2/3~OI 67
percent—to pass. If the 3.7 percentwere count-
ed as votes, Initiative One did not have two»
thirds, and if the 3.7 percent were not counted
as votes, less than 50 percent of the student
body would have voted on it. Election Board
determined that the initiative did not pass.

initiative one, if passed, would have rec-
omrncnded that a student committee examine
possible locations for a North Campus Smoke
ing loungeWith the the south Campus lounge
already determined for Cleveland on South
Campus, most students have assumed that
North Campus would have a lounge in a central
location. Clangrala seems the most likely cluster
for the new smoking lounge. But residents of
Clangrala and their Joint Board Senator Felton
have been outspoken against it. “I just wanted
to help out my constituents because that's my
job as a senator. and I too opposed the possibilr
ity of having a smoking lounge in Clangrala,"
Felton said.

Felton was disappointed that her initiative
did not pass, and she said the results were a res

ing against her idea. "People feel like nothing
is being done to get their views across to the
administmtion," she said. “Apathy really makes
a big impact on results."

All other student initiative passed with large
margins.

Initiative Two, advocating buffer days, or
reading days, passed with 83.7 percent of the
vote. Buffer days, or days off between hell week

the Mental Health Task Force and is currently
being explored by a number oflecrent admin-
istrators. “As a Student Advisor and someone
who was directly affectcd by one of the suicides
in the spring of2003,l care a lot about mental
health on campus and ways to reduce academic
stress" said co-Sponsor Elissa Staley ’05.

The dark room initiative also passed over
whclmingly, with 89.1 percent snrdents sup.
poning making darkroom space available on
campus. Keli Campbell '05, a founder of the
Grinnell Photo Society, said that the she had
had talks with the administrators, but sponsored
the initiative to raise student awareness. “It was
more so that any future action can go with the
support of the students," she said. Administra-
tors are currently looking at areas in the new
campus center that can house a darkroom.

The Environmental Coordinator initiative,
written by Eli Zigas ‘06, one of three students
on the Campus Advisory Committee on Err
vironmental Concerns, encourages the creation
of a permanent Environmental Coordinator
position. There have been two Coordinators
in the past, and each was given the job for no
more than a year. President Osgood is currently
considering creating a permanent position. The
initiative would “keep the issue on the front
burner for President Osgood," said Zigas.

physically intimidate" Cleinman. “There was
definitely a lot of tension in the room," Ford
said.

Cleinman said he “put [Kalkbrenner] in a dif-
ﬁcnlt spot on Tuesday." But he added that SGA
should hold administrators accountable and that
students deserve answers to the questions he had
posed to Kalkbrenner.

Kaklbrenner and Williams had been invited
to the meeting by 50A to discuss and answer
questions concerning Dining Services.

Kalkbrenner suggested that Joint Board en—
tered the meeting with the intent to be confron-
tational with him and Williams. “There was no
attempt to listen to Dick or me," Kalkbrenner
said.

He also said Joint Board distributed a letter
“ﬁlll of lies about various so-called dining issues”
before the meeting but did not share the letter
with him or Williams.

Williams was unavailable for comment.

Cleinman and Kalkbrenner have scheduled
to meet with Tom Crady, vice presidenr {or stu-
dent serviccs on Monday

Kalkbrenner said he thought Joint Board
should apologize, but did not expect them to do
so.

Cleinman said he hoped to receive an apolr
ogy as well “i would hope that a vice president
that acts that way in a public forum would come
out with a public apology because I feel that’s
highly inappropriate behavior,” he said.

President Russell K. Osgood said he met
with Cleinman and Kalkbrenner on Wednesday
and said he was “interested and concerned” but
would say nothing more about rhe incident.
