differences berween them run deeper rhan appearances, rheir- narive

“I'm a Roman Carholrc," said Casado “He’s a Buddhist, We’re
from Other sides of the world." The way they 'dress, speak and act is
dilferenr. “Even rhe way we dance," she said.
“Ar home ir's more explicir,The waywc dress

Where Abeygunawardarra conres from,
rhings are more conservarrve. “We dance rwo
or rhree feer away from each orher," he said.

But despire rhis, Abeygunawardana and
Casado have managed ro sray rogerher since

“Most ofour friends are inremarionai,"
Abcygunavordana said, “And mosr ofrhem

Daung among inrernarionai srudenrs
may be common, bur drere is srill a gap in Cultureia gap berween
whar is expected ofsrudenrs in Grlnrrell, and whar is expected ar
home. “I‘m nor going ro draw any conclusions," Abeygunawardana
begins, “bur from my older brorlrer, who is 23, our parenrs are look.

Abeygunawardana’s hmuy was nor ecsraric when rheir son ﬁrst

Secrets

Alok Shah ’04, from India, canrror rell hisparenrs rlrarhc isgoing
our with Chrrssre Wood “05, a rrarive Iowan, even rhorrglr rhe couple
has been daring for over lo mornhs. “lrwould bescary enough ro rell
my parenrs Iwas even daring an Indian," Shah said, “bur ir would be
even worse ro rell rhem rhar I'rn dating an Amencan girl. Ir would ger
me in a lot oftruilble.”

While Shah's parenrs don’r expect him ro move back ro India
when ire graduarcs, when he marrres chey do expecr him ro marry
whar rhey would consider a suirabie wrfe. “My parent! ideal woman
would be from rhe some background as
me," shah said. “A Jain."

“And not a white Christian," added
Wood. “ir's krnda srressful, Ir's upsetting
when he's sneaking around making cerrarn
hc doesn’r say my name roo ofren in con
versarions [ro his parenrs]. Even when he
comes ro my house to sray he has to play ir
clown and make ir seem like ir's ail iusr ca.
sual."

While rhe siruarion is srressfrrl, shah
says rhar he's used ro ir. “I’ve been doing
rlris for a long, long rimc. Even back in
India, when I was daring a girl who wasn'r
oftlie same religion, I lrad [0 hide it from
my parenrs. And I have re hide ir from
them now." -

At home and abroad

These cuirural dispariries don’r only exist berween couples from
dissimrlar, far away counrries. Aldrouglr Luis Zulemrhenavides “07 is
American, he grew up immersed in Hispanic crrlrrrre in Houston,
Texas, “Previously I lived in a Hrspanrc communiry and rhar’s why I
had only dared Hispanic girls," he said. “In American colleges rhe
vasr nraioriry ofrhe popularion is Caucasian, bur [dacing a Cauca»
sian girl] never occrrrred ro me,”

Now that zirleraelsenavides is daring Margarer Hansen ‘05, a
whirc American from Miclrrgan rhar he rner lasr sernesrer, ire sees

. that although there are cultural difference: between them, it is not an

impossrble gap ro deal wrrh.

Hansen, a iarin American scudies concenrraror, rs snrdyirrg abroad
rhis senrarer in Mexico, winch helps her undersrand Zulem-Beiuvides
berrer. “The gap berween our crrirures is lessened by hersrudying in
Mexico and learningmore abour rnycuirrrre and where I come tram,"
said Zuletaeﬂermvldrs.

zuierabenavides also needed ro approach his fanrily and com—
mrrnrry ar home abour daring someone who was nor pan of rheir
culrure. Alrhough rhey were ally surprised to hear rhe news, rhey
supporr him and hrs relarionshrp wirh Margarer. “Basically I rhink
it’s because rhey are people rhar acruaily care ahour me and care abour
whar i wanr," he said. “And ifirs a problem for anybody, i rry nor ro
pay arrenrion because I frgur-e ifrlrey are really rrry friends or really
someone I care aborrr, rhey should supporr rrre and my decisions."

Despire ail orrhe problems associared wirlr daring someone from
anorher crrinrre, rhe couples proﬁled in rhrs arricie have worked ro
reach an rrrrrlersranrling beareen one anorher.

“rm rnakrng corrsranr effor rs ro rry ro undetsund crrlrrrrai things,”
Wood snrri. “Become more familiar with India and iainrsrn. rm rak.
mg Religious 'iiadrrions of India wirlr Professor Keiring because I
warn ro learn more abour nioks religion."

Grinnell: A microcosm or an anomaly?

The communiry of Grinneil, ir seems, is conducrve ro
mulriculrrrral relarionships, “We rry as much as possible to respecr
rhe orher person even if rlrey have differerrr views,“ soid Takawira.
“So even rhough rhc academics mighr be diverse, we all end up using
the same culrural capnal rn our everyday lives,”

Jolly, who merTakawira rhrough a group proyecr in Chemisrry,
rhinks rhar it is Grinnell's academics rhar force sruderrrs to inregrare.
“ Because Grinnell is so inrerrse, and you show a lot ofwho you acru-
aily are ro everybody else when you're workingwrrh rhem, it purs you
in a posrrron yon would nor normally be pm in,“ she said.

Despirc rhrs, rhere are many who feel rhar Gtinnellians are nor
doing enough ro undersrand one anorher “I was doing an erhnogra
phy and I found that there were a lot ofAfncanAmerimns and inter»
narional srudenrs who rhoughr rhar rhere was nor enough bridging
of rhe gap," said lolly.

At leasr in rhe case of inrernarional srudenrs. some people blame
inrernauonai srudenr orienrarion, which occurs a week before new
srudenr orienrarion. “\Ve burid relarionships, friendships before the
American srudenrs even come," Abeygrrnawardana said.

Casado elaborated: “You come here. You're vulnerable. You Want
ro make friends. Even rirorrgh rnrernarionai srudenr orrenrarion has
irs benehrs, ar che same rinre rr ends rrp rhar rhe inrernarionai s'ru.
denrs rely on each orlrer a lirrle more rhan rhey probably should.“

Shah sees rhings differerrdy “At fun you hang our wirh people
who you can reiare to, who you have more in common wirh, who
you can ralk ro in your native language," ire said. “I drink ir’s a marrer
of comforr. IfI were ro dare an Indian, shares a lor rhar's already
known. Ilrave ro form [an underseanding all over again rvirh Chrissie
because we have this cultural difference, And there's this clash. \Vc
work around it, ges used ro ii."

Takawim sees rhe problem, bur places die responsibiiiry for intee
grarion wirh American srudenrs. While rhe Inrernarional Snidenr
Organizarion is open ro everyone, very few Americans arrend, “If
you go ro ISO rable, you see rnrernarional smdenrs and only a hand»
frrl oiArnerroans," he said. “Maybe we have realized char sinoe inrer.
narional srudenrs by rhemselves are failing ro inregrare. [we wair and]
see rfAmericans can rry ro bridge rhar gap. ISO has been here forso
long, and rhe gap doesris seem ro be closing. We should see ifAmerl-
cans can join ISO and if we can be friends wirh rlrern.”

beyond all ofrhe ralkofculrurai gaps, unhappy parenrs and mrse
undorsrandirrgs, rhere remains a common rhrcad which ries all of
rhese differenr relarionslrips together: rhe simple snuggle of being in
a serious rclarronshrp. Tire couples in rlris arricle, wlrrle speaking dif-
ferenr languages. helrevrng in differenr gods and holding differenr
ideas, are srill couples. And he problems drar may face, regardless of
culrure, are somewhar universal. such as rhe fear of rellmg parenrs
and farrrrly aborrr a serious relationship and rhe uncerranry of rho
fururc.

Takawira, who reccnrly rerurned home for the firsr rime in rwo
years, felr srrongc rhcre, even among his old friends, “Ir's like I had
come back ro a totally differenr place, where people had rorally dif-
ferenr viewpoinrs,” he said. “You can feel rhar we are friends, yes, But
rr’s nor the same anymore. I feel like I've been rransformed."

While ir rrrrglrr seenr rhar rhese couples are dealing with issues
rhar arc urrerly foreign ro chose who have never dared oursrde ofrlre
cninrre nrosr familiar ro rhem, rhey are, insrearl, dealing wirlr chah
lenges that nrosr wrii evenruaiiy face. Tire added culmral gap Just
makes rhirrgs a lirrle bir more rnrcrcsrirrg

“ir‘s yusr one more added srress when you’re already in a hrgh
