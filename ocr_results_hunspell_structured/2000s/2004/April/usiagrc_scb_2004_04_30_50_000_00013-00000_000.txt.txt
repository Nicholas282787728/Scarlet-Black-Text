Last pitch for prez

ecle

lfyou recall, a couple ofweeks hack 1 had an inter.
esring conversation with David “D-Ho" Horowitz where
he miraculously convened to liheraiism. As some ofyou
may have noticed, however, his speech the following
Monday failed to coalesce with my account ofhis con»
version. I know whar you’re thinking. And no, I did
not lie. I am not acrook. I did not havesexual relarious
with...

Anyway, let me explain exactly what happened. The
Sunday nighr herore his speech, D-Ho and I were share
ring overa light meal ofvegan granoiawhen I :xprcss:d
to him some criticism I had heen receiving over my
column. Sam: on campus felt that my depiction ofcon»
servatives was an unfair caricature ofpeople who merely
adhere to a political ideology different irom most
Grinnelllans, l was having rrouhie teruring this critic
cism since the Grinoell huhhle can often insulate people
from the evils permeating the real world. Then ir dawned
on me. Instead ofhaving Del—lo give a speech detailing
his transformation to lihcralism, he could give his sran.
dard campus speech, which would show Grinnell that
craaed, inflammatory,conservatives really are a dome
nanr ioree in American politics. DcHo loved rhe idea
and the rest is history. Ultimately, he should he thanked
for demonstrating why conservative ideology has no
place in constructive discourse. l—lis speech should have
made clear that inflammatory rhetoric, hererul speech
and outright lies merit conservatism’s position oflrrelr
evance in academia.

Anyway, enough ahour DrHc. Earlier this week, I
was informed hy my campaign stafrrhar this column is

the last oppoininity to make my case for the pi csidency,
From my ﬁrst statement ofiiirenr onward, l have pro.

saved two ofmy hesr proposals for lasr. Here they are:

he kicked a rhyme for me from his new
remix to “99 Problems." In the song,
he manages ro list every pressing issue

lraq, education, health care, racial proV
filing, ere) and conclude over a tight
Rick Ruhin heat that “America’s got
99 prohlems and Bush caused every
single one."

There is only one candidate in
elecnon 2004 who seeks to not just
rid conservatism rrom the white House, hut from rhe
public square altogether. Thar candidate is me. Although
a signiﬁcanr numher ofhaters and douhrers have chal.
lenged the plausihiliry of enacting my goals, we must
keep in mind that, with hope, anything is possible. As
cyhcrpunk author Rudy Rucker once said: “lithe Rosa
sians can get rid orrhe Communists, thcAmerlcans can
get rid or the Republicans." With rhar encouraging
message in mind, liherals everywhere musr unire and
vote Rarhod in 2004!

Cancer vs. loneliness

I do not smoke cigarettes. I am also from New York. a
state that has recently harmed smoking in all ions and res
sauranrs. This makes me sad, especially during the winter
monrhs. Then, when I am in a place where smoking is
illegal, I an. all alone. Why? Because while I'm inside, or.
eryone i know is ouuidc, smoking a cigarerre. And here at

Crispy Patty Parmesan

Rgading last week's Sé‘B, I was disturbed by an unfor-
ninarechangcin Grinneu's nomenclature. Ms. AnnieTessar
referred to CPP'S sad vegetarian cousin as a "meatless pony
parmesan" or MPP. Back where i come from, Grinnell at
the turn ofthe century, this ohiccr was referred to as the
“crispy Patty Parmesan.” The adventurous soul needed
only to sample this unincial food product to realize that
“crispy' was nor rhe only adjective that could he applied to
it. Given the recent conﬂicr surrounding other proposed
changm on rumpus-banning smoking. security lights and
Jen i<rohn actively updating her Plan—surely we must not
give up on this imponanr Grinnell tradition. Ofau sug—
gestions 1 could make (such as restricting smoking entirely
to cleveland Lounge, my true alma mater), restoring the
term “Crispy Parry Parmesan" to common usage would
provide rlie greasesr sense ofconrinuiry to all Grinnelli‘aiis,
young and old.
