In America (R)

B: it's easyro be angered and dis

elected officials suck, the election
process is even worse and borh rhose
problems pale in comparison ro the plight ofrhe impovetc

many young Americans don‘t vote. Yer hope remains, in
the dreams and lives of those who endure the most to be-

1o Amerim begins on the Canadian border, where an
Irish family lies rheir way into the land of the free. Soon,
they arrive in New York City, which, rhrough their eyes, is

the harsh realities oflife in New York city—the family
