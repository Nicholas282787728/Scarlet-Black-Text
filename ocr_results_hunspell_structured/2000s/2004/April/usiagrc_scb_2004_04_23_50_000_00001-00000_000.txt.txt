As ernosions rose in she roorn and snacks were made on hrs posh
riorrs, Horowire responded with his own arraeks He laser adrnirred
shar he had nor inrendesl she went so take shas direcrion. “I rhorrghr it
was in bad taste so arrack she speaker before he speaks," said Horowitz.
“l assernpred to stop nryselrbefore I [reacredh bar you can't nos reacr."

several students expressed sheir frusrrarion as well. “The maroriry
ofpeople who came here ronrghr loss out because {some} people were
[so] rmmarure," said Brian Sroifei ‘04.

Ellen sarrerwhire ‘05 agreed. “it made us look
srupid,“ she said “It made us iooksrupid so people
from she sown who came, and from osher schools.
People who came for she debare were kind of si.
lsnced."

However, in spire ofrheir frusrrarions, many, in-
cluding Horowisa himself, felr rhar she evens was
ulnmarely successful. “I was pleased by rhe rumour,"
Horowiu said. “Tl-re majority of rhe audience
handled shemsehres very well.”

cess, rnosrly because I've heard so many people ralking abous is soday,"

“tr-s going to spark a lor otdialogue and discussion." said former
chair of she Campus Republicans and Democrasic convers Chad
Matzen ‘05. “I think it's importanr so have rhis discussion given rhe

by B e n W e yl

President Russtll Osgood and other members of die
administrasion have proposed a, smoking ban in all earn.
pus buildings. According to SGA Presidens Liz Allan ‘04,
Osgood told she SGA cabinesahour she proposed ban sh see
weeks ago. Currenrly all academic buildings and ren orshe
residence halls are smokecfrce. If the ban is enacted, the
remaining nine residence halls would hesrnokotree as well.

The decision is “still up in the air," Allan said. “But the
change conld oecurasearlyas next fall."Th: change would
likely go inso effecr as she beginning ofan academic year in
order to minimize disorder and confusion that could no
crrr if she policy changed mid year, Allan said

if we implemenr is, well ny ro implemens is while
ssudenss are here, said Tom Crady, vice presidens for Stu»
dent Services.

President Osgood and the President's Ofﬁce will make
the ﬁnal decision, but Ctady said the administration does
not ltnowwhen a decision will be made and that adminis—
ssarors ar-e snll gasher-ing ssudenss inpnr. “We‘re going so
sry so garlrer as much information as we can," he said. “We
really wane so hear whar ssudenss have to say and come up
with some ideas and suggestions about it," he said.

The administrasion began considering she opsron of
bannina smoking. according so Allan, after being urged so
do so by she rrussees some parenss and a few ssudenss.

“We progressively received more complainrs over th:
pass few years,"
Crady said.
“We’ve heard it
pressy ssrongly
from students
and we’ve heard
it from some
parents. The
concern has
co me u p
enough, and we
hear it so consis-
senrly char when
it comes so healsh issues, .. . we ralse is pressy seriously."

Both SGA and the :tdministlation have both sought
ssrrdens feedback regarding the proposal. Allan said rhas
she hall senasors and SGA have received rnosrly negarive
reactions (owau'd the ban, while the administration has been
reeervinga more positive response

Crady, drough, said shar his ofﬁce has received mixed
reactions “To be honest, it: been 50 50. Its not on: way
or anorher at this moment."

Beth Allan and Crady agree that more ssudenr inpur is
required before a decision is made. Allan hopﬁ so presens
the issue to the student body as an SGA survey along with
the student initiativu on Wednesday, April 28. She also
encourages students to talk to their hall senators as well as
administrators such as Presidenr Osgood and Tom Crady.

Student Affairs has been soliciting student feedback
by holding swo ssudy breaks so far regarding she issue.The
adminisnarion also wane so holdan open forum next week.

In an effors so gauge student opmron, SGA held an
open forum lass Saturday for ssudenss so salk about the
ban. The dialogue besween she is people who arrended
was overwhelmingly negative and misrrusrnrl ofPrcsidens
Osgood and she administration.

“l‘m worried about the timing. I’m afraid that they're
going so do it during she summer when we can’s do any
thing about it," Sam Millhmlsc ’05 said.

Graeme Miller '06 said he did not like how the discus»
sion “crime from above," referring to the fact that the ad-
ministration had mkcn til: initial action, mther than con-
cerned students.
