Fall semeSter scrambled to change their
four year plan while rrying ro had a

“Whar [rho Off-Campus Srudy
Board is] doing now is formalirrng
what's :lready been occurring,” said
Richard brighr, director ofOfFCampus Srudy.

“For most of the history of rhe college, due numbers
have fallen inro place," he said, explaining why having stu-
denrs choose a semrsrer ofprsrerrnce was nor necessary in
previous years, According ro Blight, rhe rnrbalanee in rhe
numbers has been part of a nationwrde trend, which has
seen srudenrs warning ru srudy omrnrupus in rlre spring
rarher [lion in the fall.

lsr-rghr explained drar rhe need for a balancesrems from
Grinnell’s desire to capitalize on its resources. Housing.
class sizes, class schedules and dining services are all are
aherred by the number orsrudenrs srudying offrcampus.
“You‘re looking or whar is in career alargc popularron ruovc.

are an anomaly and rhar usually over 200 srudenrs per year
are given permission ro srudy abroad.

“I don’t know or any odrer eollege where drere is no
up on rhe roral number orsrudenrs who can srudy oh

Bright prcsenrcd die change ro

“My undersornding is drar they’ve
already been arbirrarily shifting people

Chrisrian Conkle ‘07, who arrended
