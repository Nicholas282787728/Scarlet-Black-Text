Pioneer tennis goes undefeated in
its spring break trip to Florida;
string of conference foes await on
the upcoming schedule

by Andrew Borneman

Few teams were busier or more successful over spring
break than the men’s tennis team. Grinnell went unde-
feated in their weeklong trip to Florida, men returned and
won two offour in their home state.

The Pioneers defeated Simpson Gel on Mar. 25. be
fore dropping sueressivo games 2! Co: college two days
later against illinols Wesleyan and the host Kohawks, and
recovering to route Monmouth 7.0 at home in their first
conference action since February

The Pioneers returned from Florida \vidi polished skills
and a renewed focus. in addition, the slower hard courts
cemented their strokes.

“The transition to hard spurts allowed our players to
utilize the slower surface to synchronim their timing," said
eosch Andy Hamilton. “Many of our individuals really
thrived on the slower surface, and two players. Rick [Fenlaert
‘06] and Shihnn [Abeygunawetdsna :05] were rock solid
in singles. Rick has won eight ofhis last nine matches and
Shihan is 11.1 in singles,"

Grinnell adiusted well when it returned to die {aster
suthrces in its first post-Florida contest at Simpson. The
only hitches came in lim Finnessy ‘04s loss at ﬁrst singles
and Eli Best 07’: hardrfought, 75 third»
set victory at second singles.

Taking on lllinois Wesleyan on Mar.
27, the men were ready for a dog right
against an opponent Finnessy docrrbcd as
“one ororrr roughest matches or the sen.
son." Although Fenbert and
Aheygunswardsna continued their singles
winning streak with straight—set vrcrorics
over their Wesleyan counterparts, the rest
of the team didn't fare 3 well, losing in
every other spotThe closest orrnnell um:
was in the ﬁve»spot, where Julian West ’06
fought back after a 7-5 loss in the ﬁrst set
to take the second one 7-6. However, he
fell 6-1 in the decisive set and Grinnell lost 5—2 overall.

“Our loss to lllinoichsleyan was disappointing," said
best. “They’re a very strong team, but irwe eould have

Grinnell lost its second match later that day against
perennial nemesis Co: by a 7.0 margin and lost eight or
the nine total matches. The Plo-
necrs, though, felt that the score
didnt rcll the whole story, as Ryan
Kusbhc or Coe barely scraped by
Kushal Shah ‘05 in s deciding no
break Brij Patnnrlr ‘05 and
Abcygunawardam held their nerves
for a second doubles success.

“Playing Coe was good for the
team. We had s raw elose matches
and everyone played with o lot of
intensity because of the level of
competition, Shihnii and Btu even
grabbed n huge win at two
doubles," said Best.

The sound re—marshaled this intensity in their match
with Monmouth the next day, not losing n match, user or
even more than rout games in a set against the Sons.

"Sweeping [Monmouth] gives the team a lot ofconﬁr
dense about our chances against the rest or the confer»
ence,” said best who, in spire orsn injured shoulder which
has forced him to serve underlrand, handily defeated Ryan
brugo 6-3, 6-3.

“i guess it's pretty funny. but [Bingo] didn't seem to
agree when I aced him our wide on the id side and hear
him three and three."

Finnessy mirrors his teammates sentiments orrhe win
over Monmouth.

“We continuedourdominance orthe south Division,"
he said, “We ran through them in a little under three hours
which is prcrry rough to do indoors since there are only
iour eourn. There weren't any rears orhcrorsm that i can
recount; it was simply a dominant performance from top
to bottom."

Hamilton is conﬁdent ofhis terms future endeavors,
but admits that “we need to keep improving In doubles rt
we are going to challenge in the M rdwest conference."
