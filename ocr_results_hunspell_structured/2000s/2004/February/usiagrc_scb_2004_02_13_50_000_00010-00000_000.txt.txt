Dan Binwn 'us played a fer-r sports in
high school, including tennis, but ivas
never one to consider exelclsmg, but for
the last year, since the spring semester of
his sophomore year, Brown has followed a
rigid diet and exercise routine. including
most recently giving up all processed
sugac

”1 exercise five days a week, usually,
sometimes six if I can pull it off. I lift
weights for a half-hour, fortyrflve minutes
and then do some kind of cardio for a
half-hour, usually running."

Bmwn exercises for appearance and to
stay healthy, but he also does it to
structure his life and develop a routine,
something he admits is not easy to do.

"If I'm able to maintain one aspect of
my routine thatI do everyday, like
working out, it helps me stay disciplined
to do everything eLse," said Brown, "A
good chunk of students try to maintain a
healthy lifestyle, but I think it's really
hard. Maintaining a routine, especially
when you're stressed—out with work, it's
just one more thing you have to do, It's
a hard thing to maintain but its worth
it,"

Besides ﬁnding it difficult to schedule
time to exercise, it is difhcult with
Gn'nrlell's limited facilities to find space
or machines to use.

"I don't really think that the college
itself pushes physical wellness at all,
especially with the message they send
with their facilities. The reason that the
machines are always so crowded at 4:30 is
that there are only [a few] cardiovascular
machines."

Another difficulty of maintaining a
healthy lifestyle under intense stress is
the struggle of avoiding all certain foods
at the dining hall. for Brown, the dining
hall is tricky though they usually offer a
healthy option

”it's tough because they throw [the
food] in front of you...I give myself time—
off and eat what I want, but I try and
avoid a lot of the more unhealthy stuff.

Ialk to Said filert be about her work
out habits, and she'll frequently mention
how exercise helps her to organize her
time,

”when I know that I want to work
out,” she said, ”I have to work my day
avound that."

k four-sport athlete in high school.
Eilert found it difficult to give up sports
when she got to college. "being on a
team gives a certain structure to your
day. And lvhen you get to college you
lose that outlook. You forget you have
that pan of your day."

Erlert goes to the PEC most days of the
week, typically spending about an hour
there at a time, After doing some sort of
cardiovascular activity'ffequefltly the
elliptical trainer—for 30 to 1.0 minutes,
she spends another 15 to 30 minutes on
weight training and sit-ups, "depending
on how tired I am, and what else I have
to do."

Though Eilert is from orinnell, her
wovk out mutlfle varies in the animal.
"Since the weight room is open only
limited hours, I started running a little
hit. I ran when I was abroad, too."

Eilert studied in belgium the first
semester of heriunior year. she found
attitudes toward fitness similar there,
though they had only recently been
adopted. 'Ihey'd just built a new fitness
center at the university I was at, So
evenyone was really excited about it and
getting into it, They already played
sports, but they didn't do the whole
treadmill, ireecweights thing."

Erlert's also noticed more urinnellians
getting into the "treadmill, fieecweights
thing" since her hrst year, “In the four
years since I've been here, the weight
room has gone from a place primarily for
athletes to a place where everyone goes
once or twice a week. And I think that's
why the administration rightly saw a
need to change the current facilities."

Erlert thought the weight room's
atmosphere could be improved. "It's kind
of drab right now, Windows would be
nice, and maybe a couple of TVs,”

while generally happy with the
equipment, she thought there should be
more of it, which would in turn solve
other problems, such as waiting time.
"The hours are pretty good; I don't think
there's much [the administration] can do
to extend them, And when there's more
equipment, there won't be that need,”

In addition to the expected physical
benefits Eilert reaps from exercise, she
also finds working out helps her
mentally, "It's a good stress release, I
concentrate better on my academics.
That's where working out really helps
me—my overall mental health and
focus."

On his workout routine: I get up at about five of 5 am.
and go shooting out the door and go running for four to
eight miles, depending on how awful the weatheris,
meaning cold Idon’t particularly mind it if it's raining or
hot, but if it's very cold it's a shorter run,

Then I go swimming at 11 am virtually every day for about
a half an hour.

Sometimes in the summer, it's a really beautiful day and it's
hot and not only will I go running in the morning and swim
at noon but I'll go running at 4:30, because that's actually
when ! prefer to run, but it's so hard for me in my current
Job to run at 4:30.

oh how he began Exercising: I was going to college andI
had a very Vankee father; he's an old Massachusetts guy
Never says anything to his kids about anything. So he's
dropping me off at college and he hands me a letter and I
thought, "wow, its money" like everyone thinks. So he
leaves. The letter said "Dear Russell, you don't exercise
enough You should exercise more. It's important for living
your life.” It wasn't like weight or anything like that.

This was September of 1955 and it didn't make an
immediate impact. But three weeks later, I came back to
my room and I was frustrated. I was taking a really heavy
schedule and I wasn't sleeping that well. And I thought
"I'm going to go running,” which I‘d never done and was a
relatively uncommon thing. I went outside and it was
absolutely beautiful outside. Ivras pathetic. I think I might
have mil half a mile, but I lnvedjust being outside and I
enjoyed running. So that is when I started running and I
have run almost every day since,

His wellness advice: My punch line is that I strongly
recommend for all of you not to be crazy like me. I probably
exercise it too much. I think I’m too fanatical about it but
itjust helpsyou keep balanced in life and keep tenleied.

On his workout routine: Every morning, about ten til 5
a,m., I arrive at the PEC and do so minutes on a stair
stepper and most days I do five or ten minutes of lifting.
I've always woken up very early. Usually I wake up before
my alarm rings. I used to deliver newspapers at 4:30 in the
morning and I think I got in the habit of being an early
riser. It does mean I'm not awake much after 10:30 or n
inl,

Dn how he got started working out: I've been running
almost every day since 1990. I started running during a
period when I was having back problems, At first I
thought, ’Oh, I shouldn't exercise when I have back
problems," Ihen after I tned running a little hitI realized
my back problems went away. Then I decided that running
would be a part of my wellness. I've almost never been sick
since I started in my routine. I've never missed a class at
Giinnell for illness. I've felt a lot better since I started
exercising. I mean, I always rode my bike or walked to
work but I never set aside time for exercise.

On his diet: My appetite is a little bit less when I exercise.
But one reason I work out, one thing that motivates me, is
that I don't want to cut back on what I eat. I love
chocolate, for instance. I feel better about indulging in
some vices when I get an early start where I burn off a
bunch of calories. That secondary motivation is an
important one.

On her workout routine: "I normally run for as rninutes
first thing in the morning. Inside now because it's so cold
and snowy outside. I do a little bit of rowing, about five
minutes. ihen I ride a stationary bike for a little bit Then I
go to the pool to swim, I'm not a very good swimmer. Ijust
Want to get into the l'latel and relax a little,”

On swimming: "I rust learned how to swim last year. I had
never been in a pool my whole life but John Pfitsch (former
athletic difectoi) taught me hovr to swrnr The way he
taught was he stood by the pool and told me how to do it.
But I've signed up fora swimming class this semester. I'm
going to learn with toach hurley. She's veny good, I need
to improve my technique and so forth, So that will happen
the second half of the semester,

Swimming is a very good exerclse, It's gentle on your knees
and ankles It's a veny Taoist sport because you have to
[93m how to lelax and MW to work with the water, nut to
fight against it. '

On her diet: ”I'm pretty careful about wliatIeat. for one
thing it's very busy working here. I have a lot of things to
take care of, so I have to take care of myself first because
health is the most important thing. without health you
can't do anything, basically,"

On yoga:

People think of yoga as Just physical pustules. In fact, it
has a lot of different parts to it, Part of my yoga practice is
also meditation, breathing and even chanting, I meditate
and do the breathing practices every single day I do the
physical practices at least three times a week.

On the length of a yoga workout:

"It's minimum of an hour and a half. Preferably two and a
half hours. It's kind of hard to fit it in. I don't mean to
make the impression that if you don't have ten minutes
that you can't do something useful for the body. If you get
up every day and spend hve minutes doing the sun
salutation, which I tny to do every single day, thats a
fabulous thing.

On when she began doing yoga:

I broke my back in my mid 205. Iwas in graduate school at
the time. I couldn't afford physical therapy, and people
suggested that I take up something like yoga or modern
dance to open up my spine, and I did both kinds of classes
for years.

I did yoga classes for a while with someone who was very
fit and competitive, and I stopped doing it because I rust
wasn't able to. ! picked it up again about five or six years
ago in a different tradition whi as more about
respecting your body and its at es, Thatiust made a lot
of sense to me.

On her diet:

voga has its traditions in kryuveda, which is a very ancient
medicine that has its own very strict and formalized dietI
try very much to be a vegetarian, and for the most part, I
avoid all processed foods.

One of the great things about doing yoga is you pay more
attention, you're just more aware of your body so you
notice when you're doing something unhealthy to yourself,
like eating garbage. If you eat crappy food, you feel crappy.
So you have to take better care of yourself, which is really
nice, I would say it affects my diet in that way. I try to
practice yoga as I try to do all things, which is in
moderation.
