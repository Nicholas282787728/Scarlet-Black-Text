False alarm

Misinformation and a case of mistaken chemical identity brought a bomb

by Amanda Davis

A relarivciy irarmiess one pound iarofammoiiium per.

18 to 19 as campus officials tried to determine how to
dispose oithe chemical. The state Department ofNatural
Resources (DNR) initially advised exploding the jar, as rr
was roo hazardous ro rransporr or dispose ofin any orlicr
way. However, that rccommendariori was based on an in.
correcr descriprion of iris ciiemicai.
Half a campus evacuarioii and one
bomb squad larcr, college officials
learned that Lhc chemical was actually
safe enough to dissolve it in water and
ﬂush down .t drain.

which can react with ammonium perchlorate when mixed.
A similar mixture, using ammonium nitrate instead of
ammonium perciiioraro, was used in ibe Oklahoma City

n powerrul oxidizer.

This salt is used as an
explosive iri mines, due to
the low temperature
elevation that follows its
decomposition.

It is produced by
reaction between ammonia
and perchloric acid, or by
double decomposition
between an ammonia salt
and sodium perchlorate.

It crystallizes in colorless
