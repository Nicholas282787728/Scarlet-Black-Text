Lotti" Travis/anon is a poetic movie. Poetic meaning personal yet often
difficult to interpret Coppola successfully destroys the narrative for most
ofthe movie. The acting, especially Bill Murray‘s subdued humor, is im-
peccable. And i bet Grinncllians will relate to the themes of being physi-

for monotonous hometowns.
