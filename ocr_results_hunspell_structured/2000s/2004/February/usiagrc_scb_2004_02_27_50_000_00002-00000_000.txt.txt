Eating disorder awareness

by Leslie Boyadjian

The studenlerun group Healthy Body, Healthy Mind
(HBHM) hosted a series ofaclivitics and study breaks this
week designed to increase awareness ofthe threat and prevae
lance ofeating disorders. Eating Disorder Awareness week
began on Monday and continues through today, featuring
study breaks, ﬁlms and events designed to help students
tapewirh mung problemsand 1mm how to raise betterotteor
themsdyo, whether or not they have mung disorders.

“11’: such :1 shameful closeted disorder that it's rul tough
to talk abaut,” said group co-foundet Paul Dul'fln ‘05, “[nnd
this is] sort ofa week to step back and look at your life and
health."

Srarted last year by Dufﬁn and Alissa Briggs '05,
HBHM seeks to promote awareness of eating disorders
and provide help to people who either suii'er from eating
disorders or have friends who suffer from eating disorders
find resources.

“Paul and I started the group," said Briggs, “a: a source
for people to eome to who were having issues. because we
didn’t feel as though that source existed on campus."

In addition to providing resources forxuffcrcrs, HBHM
arms to spread awareness ofwhat they see as an inereasing
problem, “It’s on the rise for sure" said Briggs. “The ages
at which people are starting with dose problems are get.
ting younger and younger."

A 2002 poll on the website hrq7://www,:omtt/7ingﬁr/1y
org indieated that 52 percent of eating disorder sufferers
began having trouble between the ages oflO and lsTwelye
percent reported problems that began before their 10th
birthdays,

In addition to spreading awareness or the inereasing
problem, HBHM hoped to rpretdawarenass orrheirgroup
and about health in general this weelr Eating Disorder
Awareness week featured events such as a film entitled
Merchants of Cool, “Dining Hail 101,” where students
learned how to eat healthily and treatwely in the dining
hall, and adiseiission about ineorporating important things
into their lives. Monday tortured body deeorating in
Gardner Lounge. partieipanrs were inyited to trate their
bodies onto colored butcher paper and paint them,

“it's something fun," Diimn explained, stepping bath
fmm his painting. “llt'sl a dinetent way oflaokjng at your
body and celebrating it."

In addition to eating disorders, HBi—{M eoneenrrates
on general health, and meeting topiet vary depending on
what people want to tallt about.

“we feel that in the past people have thought that our
group was iusr for people who had eating disorders," said
Briggs, “but it's . .. for everyone."

The group meets every Monday at 3 p m, in the F0»
rum Coffeehouse. All are tneoumged to attend,

SPARC funds low

An unusually large number attending
requesis this semester rotted the student
Publications and Radio Committee
(SPARC) to deny some student publication
groups their requests, but, aeeording to
SPARC business manager iaeob Kaufman»
Osborn ‘04, there is probably no reason ror
alarm.

“Th'isseinestet isan exeeption. I haven’t
seen a trend or people asking tor more
money," he said. “it's more requesu than
1've ever seen before it was a lot less last
semester.”

Each semester SPARC hinding is dis.
riibuted among publication groups There
are ﬁve permanent publimtionsithc 5w,
the cyclone, the GUM, l<Dic and the con.
11:” Rwirw—a: well as a varying number
of temporary publimtion groups.

To get funding, every group must sub.
mir a budget to the SPARC tonimittee for
review. The permanent publimtions areyir.
nially guaranteed funding, “They've been
around for a long time, they've established
themselves," said KaufmaneOSborn.

The rest otuie publieitions are Funded
at rhediseretion oftthI’ARC eommittae,
depending on the remaining funds This
semester the committee was roteod to deny
some larger requests in raver or several
smaller ones. “were trying to get the larg.
est amount of impaet for our money," said
Kaufman-Osborn.

While Kaufmanerbotn admits that
there were rejections this semester he does
not see any reason for alarm, at least not
yet. SPARC will eontinue to be funded by
part orthe student activity ree, “To the best
Dfmy loiowlealg , [thesrARc fund] is the
same as it’s been," said Kaufman-Osborn,
“and will continue to be the same."
