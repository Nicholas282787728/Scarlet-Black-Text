At 11 am, on Saturday, the women’s
team will square off against second7
seeded CarroLl College, who knocked
off the Pioneers 2-1 last sundry in
Wisconsin. A breakaway goal in the
eighth minute put the host team up
1—0 early on. It was nearly 70 minutes
before Kari Scheelk ﬁnished a scramble
for a corner kick to secure a Carroll
victory. Grinncil senior Kelsey Alford7
Jones netted the lone Gl‘lnnell goal in
the 85th minute.

“The most critical point in the
match was the first ten minutes when
we were adjusting to the speed of our
opponent," said Grinnell coach Heath7
er Benning. “Carroll is
deﬁnitely the fastest team
we have faced and we were
caught offguard by how
quickly they pushed for—

in behind us."

Carroll plays homc

“Against Lake Forest, it'sjust a mat7

time we played them we just didn’t put
together a full 90 minute game"

The key to success at conference
will be tenacity nor skill, coach Ben7
ning explained.

“We learned last year that the best
team doesn't always win, but that the
team that comes into the tournament
willing to leave it all out on the field
and seize every opportunity will be the
victor," she said.

Grinnell wasn’t just
the best team at Confer-

av Joe GENI

Grinnell women's tennis could have been more
dominant this season—but not much.

The Pioneer women's tennis team ﬁnished its
two7monrh rear by winning the Midwest Conference
ream championship they came so close to winning
last year, and dominated the individual champion-
ships to boot.

“Last year was really hard bccausc we felt robbed
almost, because we went into it being the bcst team
and lost a heartbreaker, 574," said c07captain Jill
Harms '05. “This year, coming back into it we were
the number one seed again, and we actually won,
which is the most amazing feeling."

In the team championships, crinncll playcd
against Carroll in the first round, but only as a formal7
ity. By the time the Pioneers were ﬁnished sweeping
the doubles and having top-seeded Shweta Khajuria
'07 and fourth-seededJill Harms ’05 handily win their
singles matches. Grinncll had clinched a see victory
and rendered the remaining four singlcs matches un7
necessary

The championship rematch with Lake Forest was
a different story, however.

“We went into it really ready to play, but Lake
Forest came out with this amazing doubles matches,"
said Harms. "They played better than I’d ever seen
them. It was kind ofwhat happened last year, and it
shook the team a bit, but we pulled it together and
played amazing singles matches.”

The top two doubles teams for Grinncll suffered
surprising upsets (for the Khajuria sisters at the No.
I dobulcs spot, it was indeed thcir first defeat of the
year), but Rachel Engh ins and Jocelyn Newhousc
‘08 clinched a 672, 670 victory at the No. 3 doubles
spot.The Pioneers rapidly took the top three doubles
matches, and when Engh won at the fifth singles
spot, the Pioneers could call themselves MWC team
champions for the first time since 1998.

“As soon as we won, we stormed the court," said
Harms. “This team was so close, and to actually
achieve it was an amazing experience,"

Grinnell demonstrated one reason why it won
its ﬁnal 10 matches, compiled an 11-1 record, and
dominated the MWC team championship the fol-
lowing day at the MWC Individual Championships
at Nielsen Tennis Sradum in Madison, Wisc. The
Pioneers proved their depth and versatility when they

won all three individual doubles titles and five of the
six singles championships as well.

“The team is deep, that’s for sure," said head coach
Barbara Waite. “Although last year's team was dccp.
too. Unfortunately we had a slow start due to illness
and injury. This year's team has been hardier from day
one. They've certainly had their share of aches and
pains, but I rarely heard about it."

The Pioneers are done for the year unless either
an individual or the team acquires a sufficient ranking
to earn additional play dates in the spring and a trip to
nationals, which as far as Waite is aware of has never
happened for Grinncll women's tennis. As it stands,
however, the fall season begs the question of whether
this year’s rcnnis squad is the best in team history.

“There are many ways to determine the laser
team, aren’t there?" said Waite. “This team deﬁnitely
stands out in many ways. They have the best record
orrny team I've ever coached and they were a great
group to work with." ,

"The main diffcrcncc is that we’ve got an ama17
ingly deep lineup this year," said Hnrms. “I’ve never
played on a team so united and so focused on a com7
mon purpose."
