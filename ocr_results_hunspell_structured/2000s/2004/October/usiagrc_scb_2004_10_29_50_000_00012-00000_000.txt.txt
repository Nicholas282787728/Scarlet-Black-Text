with the

uccompa- nying
prospect of“the next Florida," (which might
cvcn be Iowa) but the field is ripe with other
possibilities.

First is the prospect of an electoral tic. It
is certainly possible for both candidates to
receive 269 electoral votes.

There are at least two plausible :lllocrl-
tions ofswing states that yield the result.

Now, in principle, the
constitution is clear enough

not too simplv

The pro cm is 55,
[acted by the House in a
svstcm whcre cach House
delegation gets one vote.

Since Republicans are in the majority in
30 statc dclcgntions, this would scam to pro-
pose a clcar victory for Bush (I am linking
the very safe assumption that thcrc would bc
no landslide changes in the House.)

But what lchiry wins the popular vote?
Would not there be a clear moral obligation
to vote for the candidate with the popular
mandate>

It might not be clear enough to sway
those delegations with Republican majofl’
tics ol’t‘ive, as in my home

The many who assume rhat wt: actually

themselves.

Remember, with our quaint system of
electing a president, it isn’t the American
public or even states that do the electing, but
rather people calling thcmsclves “electors."
Historically, there have been 156 electoral
votes cast for candidates
not choscn by the clectors’
party.

These are the cases of
“faithlcss electors "In some

5&B guide to the
2004 elections

“Th . i5 thc most important clccriorl of
your life." On Feb. 9, 2003 Howard Dean
kicked off election season by preaching
this message to a packed south Lounge
audience. Over the past your and a half,
the campus has been hit with a barrage of
candidates and speakers working to drive
this message home.

Norierbelcss, we cannor emphasize
enough that this election will depend
on how many voters tuin out. Depressed
turnout all but ensures a Bush victory in
Iowa, and with the race so close, in the
overall election as well.

With that in mind, we make one final
plea for students, raeiilry, administrators
and staff to vote and volunreer. Having
said that, we would like to address some
Election Day issues that have not received
as much attention and could be easily
overlooked.

1) Fill out the whole ballot. The presi-
dcncy is not the only office up for election.
Most notably, thcrc arc hotly contested
races for the national House of Represcne
tatives, Iowa State House and Iowa State
Scriatc.

Since these are all local races with him
itcd turnout, your vote can go a long way.
Also, each of these races features candi-
dates with strong ideological differenccs,

For instance, the Republican candidate
for the Iowa State Senate has stated that
Jews and Hindus are at the root of Amer-
ica’s problems (see. “Local politicians draw
criticism for remarks" in the April 28, 2003
edition of the 553), while his Democratic
opponent has not.

Likewise, the Republican candidate for
Iowa State House has openly campaigned
to install the Ten Commandments in Iowa
schools, while. his Democratic opponent
has rior. The choice is yours.

2) Don't vandaliae...ehannel your
energy in more “constructive” ways. Vans
dalism on campus is not cool. Few stu»
dents arc left at Grinncll who rcmcmbcr
what happened after rhc 2000 elections.
To summarize, massive chaos ensued after
the votcs were tallied as students Engaged
in 14 incidents of arson, property damage
and theft.

We should all remember that it is stir
dcnts who assume the cost of such acts.
Rather than promot: destruction, studcnts
should strongly consider other releases
for all of that pent~iip anxiety. Check out
www weer-gm iii-g for advice on how to
have an extra special clcctiortnight.

3) Report voter suppression Since
this election will be so close, some are
likely to resort to unseemly tactics to en-
sure victory. If you see any signs ofpcoplc
discouraging others from voting or ofpeo»
plc being turned away at the polls, please
report it to the county auditor at (641)
62375443,

4) Drink responsibly and only drink
unionized beer. No matter what the m,
suits are, don’t get carried away drinking.
For instance, taking a shot of vodka for
every electoral vote Bush wins is prob-ably
notwise.

Bcsidcs, vodka‘s a drink for the Com—
munists. )3: a true American, steer clear of
conservativelyrsponsorcd Coors and sup‘
port unionized hcer companies like PBR.

5) Have fun. The presidential elections
only come around once every four years.
Don't spend your time getting stressed,
Get with some friends, fill out an electoral
map from our very own Features page 9
and watch Fox News for a good laugh.
