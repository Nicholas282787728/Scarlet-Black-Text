When you laid outyour views about col-
lege presidents, something came up that
I’ve heard students talk about, I don’t know
the particulars on the issue or even the
sides, but you said "don’t stay for too long."
What is too long?

In my view, ten years is plenty. In retro-
spect, there's nothing wrong with twelve.Thc
logic whcn we got to ten was that we were
just starting the athletic building and we were
just starting the strategic plan. If] could just
make it to twelve then we would have ﬁn-
ished the building and ﬁnished the strategic
plan and we had no other buildings scheds
ulecl, so that was sort ofthc logic.

How is the strategic plan, have you ac-
complished all ofthe goals?

1 think so. i think there are still some
things that need mote work. Diversity is one
of them, l think the big goals have been ac-
complishcd. One ofthe goals has been nega-
tivcly impacted, that's the goal of revenue
balancel'he endowment fell and our expenss
cs have, we’ve controlled them well, but our
overall ﬁscal situation is no more balanced
than it was at the beginning ofthe plan. Hav—

ing said that, we are in excellent, I won’t even
say that, we are in superb ﬁnancial condition.
But the long-term issues for running a college
ﬁnancially are very tricky and this place will
have to maneuver them. We are very depen‘
dent on our endowment. If it were to drop
again it would be a very serious matter.

Try to make it a little more light, we were
talking about Dr. Kington, and
you said that we wouldn’t hear
anything critical.

And l probably won’t think
anything critical. so it won’t be
that I'm hiding something,

Good! But what sort of role
are you playing in ensuring that
his transition goes smoothly?

Again, my view is that I
should sit in my office and answer all or his
calls, and iii think 1 see a disaster happening,
I‘ll call him up and tell him about that. But
I shouldn't be thcrc calling any of the shots.
He’s been around, he's had majotjobs, this is a
capable mltn or he wouldn't be where he is. In
my time here, 1 had three living predecessors
that l was close to, and they were incredibly
valuable to me, But they all had kind of dlf’
tereut approaches Ont: ofthcm would toll me
exactly what he thought. Pain Ferguson would
listen to me respectfully and than shc would
put her arm around nae and tell ins “it’s up to
you, Russell."lust talking to her helped, you
know what I mean, because I would have to

collect my rhoughts.And then George Drake
is justa tremendous resourcc,with the history
of the place. I have been incredibly blessed
with predecessors. When I was at Cornell by
the way 1 had ﬁve living predecessors all on
the faculty and that was fantastic too. So I
hope I could be of some use, but I have no
intention otsriclting my nose in anywhere.

Besides lengthy Q&As

like this one, is there any»
thing youd like to warn
Dr. Kington about?

Let me just say. before
1 came, people gave me all
kinds ot warnings abour
this place: “Be concerned
about this, be concerned
about that." They were all
wrong. one ofthcm, some
one told me the students

were very different, nothing like Cornell, and

that was completely wrong. someone said,

“Well the Board ofTruslees is very bossy and

will micromauage you."Wroug, there was no

truth in it.'l'he one bit of advrce Iwould give

Dr, Kington would be, if someone tells you

that something is a huge problem, investigate

it, but don't believe it's necessarily true.

You should tell him to always say yes to
Scarlet 8:. Black interview requests.

As you know, I believe that, and I believe
in doing it immediately, becauso bad things
happen when you try and hide from rho press,

and when you don't fully talk about it. That
doesn’t mean you talk about every detail.

WhatwillyoumissmostaboutGrinnell?

Basically, I like dealing with undergradu-
ates a lot I think it’s an absolutely fantas-
tic period in life. Because you’re pretty well
grown up, you're more grown up than your
parents thinkyou are. butyou're also in a for-
matlve period where you’re ﬁguring out what
you want to do. and that's fantastic. Law stu-
dcnrs, I’ll probably continue to deal with stu—
dents, but it's not as intimate as when you're
president, so I’ll miss that a lot, I will also
miss being in this town. I like it. I likc run-
ning in the cornfields. But I’m going to back
to my hometown where l grew up. My wite
grew up there.

What town is that?

Rockport, Massachuserrs, And, as 1 said,
I will continue to teach, I'm going to teach
for Grinnell next £111,111 probably teach in a
law school in Europe or in the United states
next spring.

You don’t even have to plan?

I've been askcd by a bunch ofplaces. My
goal right now is to not say yes to anyone, just
think about it. I’ve been so busy for so long
that I'injust going to figure it our carefully.
