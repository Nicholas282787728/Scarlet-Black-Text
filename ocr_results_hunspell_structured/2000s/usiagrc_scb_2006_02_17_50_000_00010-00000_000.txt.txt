Fireworks in Nanjing

With its sights and sounds, Chinese New Year celebration provides an exciting introduction

There’s a point, in settling into new
surroundings, where you realize you're
arm/1y where you are, And while I
started adapting in little ways as soon as
I arrived in
Nanjing, for
some tea»
son I could
really only
concentrate
on a few
new things
at once.

My ﬁrst two days, I focused on
remembering my 16 ClEE-Nan-
jing counterparts
names, getting a
handle on the toilets
(sometimes dubbed
‘squatty potties’)
here, ﬁnding food
and learning how
to drop it a little bit
less.

So, I didn’t res
alize I was in China—and not just an
environment wirh lots of new people,
different toilets, and delicious but slips

Today, when I felt that moment of
awareness that I am actually in China,
sparks flew. When I say sparks ﬂew,I

I realized I am really here. Today is
the last day of Chunj'ie—the two-week
Spring Festival—that begins with the
New Year. In China, New Year’s isn't
just it oneeday thingithe festivities last
for weeks.

I heard firecrackers pop sporadi-
cally all day. But around 8:30 pm,
as I returned to the Xi Yuan (Nanjing
University's foreign students dormir
tory) with three friends, the fireworks
really got going.

The four of us collectively half
lunged/yelled as, without warning, peo

ing at close range.

My normal re-
action upon hearing
a loud boom on a
city street at night is
fear. For a split sec-
ond I looked around
and felt the urge to
duck and cover.

But something
interfered with my initial reaction: res
membering where l was and what was
going on, my friends and l laughed and
said, “Xin nian kuai 1e!“ (Happy New
Year).

I took a break from writing this to
watch the ﬁreworks with my roommate
from our 16th ﬂoor window.

Shooting up from the street in
front of the Xi Yuan, fireworks reach
their apex of ﬂight and explode right at
our eye level.

The ﬁreworks show to which my
roommate and I have the best seats,

aloft about twenty or thirty feet in the
air for a while, as green sparks shoot out
from the bottom.

Looking out upon
Nanjing’s cityscape
from the 16th ﬂoor,
fireworks go up in
distant streets and
alleys here and there,
and I see light ﬂicker
on the facades of
buildings for a few
moments at a time.

Having never missed a Fourth of
july ﬁreworks show in all of my 21
years, I’ve seen a lot of pyrotechnics.
But I’ve never watched the sparks fly
from above before.

Having studied Chunjie within a
holiday-themed chapter of Iiiltgrﬂttd
Chinese in a ZOOelevel Chinese class,
I’ve known the fourteen strokes com,
prising the characters Chun and jie for
about a year.

But I couldn't really write about it
until today.

Violent resistance can do good

Dear Grinnellians,

I do not understand your widespread ideological
commitment to “nomviolence.” My personal beliefs
include that people have the right to self—determina—
tion.

considering rhis,the problem is ifpcoplc feel vioe
lence is their only realistic path of resistance. In other
words, the problem is the rigidity of the system being
resisted or acted against rather than the actor.

l recently saw Joe Carr speak
on campus, an ant'rlmperial active
istwho personally does not engage
in violence, however, I believe the
title of his talk was “Stories of Re
sistance."

Naturally, he chronicled some
instances of violent resistance.
Many students seemed to take is
sue with the fact that he either gloe
rifled “terrorism," failed to condemn “terrorism," or

have little doubt that many Grinnellians would have
a problem drawing a connection between poor Condl’
tions in US ghettoes and gang violence.

I fail to understand why this connection is not
made to violence in other areas of the world. In both
cases, civilians are killing other civilians because they
feel that act will ultimately better their community‘s,
or their own, situation.

Considering this, it seems very
privileged to even have the choice
of noneviolent self-determination.

Viewing noneviolence as a
purely ethieal decision, I feel, does
not reﬂect the position that many
people find themselves in world-
wide,

idea that voting makes a signiﬁcant

placency and derachmcnrs. For groups ofAmerlcans
who don’t feel that they have a realistic voice through
non-violent methods, our history is rich with violent
resistance.

Though I don’t advocate it, 1 would argue rhar
violent resistance, at times, can be thought of as self
sacriﬁce.

Whether one risks his or her life through join-
ing the armed forces, hoping to spread freedom, treks
through the southwestern desert hoping to find work
and support their family, or perhaps, commits some
act that we do not truly understand, self-sacrifice for
the beneﬁt of others is one of humanity’s greatest
qualities.

I encourage response and debate with a sincere
hope that this dialogue will not degenerate into petty
personal attacks.

So, students ofGrinnell, I submit to you a choice:
question everything, or be a victim of authority.
