Faulconer Gallery’s current exhibit,
"Scandinavian Photography 1:
Sweden" features 26 Swedish
photographers and styles that would
not ordinarily be seen together

Bv ERIC RQHN

For much ofthe ﬁrst halfofits nearly ZOOrycar existence,
photography was not taken seriously as an art form, In fact,
French critic and poet Charles Baudelaire considered it the
“refuge of failed painters with too little talent.”

However, anyone looking at the many works presented at
the Faulconer Gallery's exhibit “Scandinavian Photography
1: Sweden" will see an intriguing Cl‘osvscctlon ora ﬂourish-
ing and diverse art form.

The current exhibit, cuiatcd by Dan Strong, features 26
currently working Swedish photographers But while their
nationality and medium may be shared, their work is by no
means similar,

The exhibit includes a variety ofstylcs, ranging from the
abstract, inkblot like, black and white works of Bjorn Dir
widsson to the detailed and colorful landscapes of Anders
Krisa‘r. The wide range of the exhibit shows both the im~
mense variety of styles in the art world and the versatility
ofphotography as an art medium. These photographers do
not simply capture reality with their cameras, they bend it,
give it an element ofsubjectivity and even manipulate their
images into something surreal.

While most or the photographs exhibited are from the
last ten years, the show includes works stretching back as
far as 1955 The February is gallery talk by Swedish cur
rator Niclas Ostlind, entitled “From Different Viewpoints.
Dreams and desires, reality and ﬁction, explained many of
the elements behind the works presented. One ofthe most
intriguing aspects of the exhibit was the presentation of
many different photographers and styles that, according to
Ostlind, would not be seen together."

The talk revealed not only the longtime separation of
photography from what was conr
sidered ”hi her" art forms, but
also the diléferent approaches to At a

hoto ra h itself. Osdind ex-
isting sigma. dastardly glan ce
dealt with the idea ofdesire. From What' Art exhibit
looking at the Swedish images this WhO'ISwedish
seems to be a pretty consistent ii
them p otographerrs

The images in this exhibit deal Wale Fa”l‘°”e’
with desire, whether it be physical, When' gm 23»
intellectual, or metaphorical. The M ' W
. . . . arch 18
idea of desire is given sexual charge
in the often graphic images ofJH.
Engstrom, but in Lars Tunbjo’rk's series on the workplace,
desire seems to take on the idea of carving out a piece of
humanity into the hectic world ofbnsiness.

However, for all of the artists the idea ofdesire seems to
motivate both their subjects and their own approach to their
work. Ostlind’ s contrast of reality and fiction' in the exhibit
seemed to be both a conflict between styles and a desire to
push the limits of photography‘s possibilities While ‘att’
photography focuses on the expression of an artist's own
aesthetic and personal views, ‘documentary' style photogmr
phy attempts to portray the reality of the world.

Ostlind explained the conﬂict between the argument be-
tween the ‘documentary’and ‘art’photographers as a stylistic
conﬂict between those who thought personal relevance and
aesthetic were more valuable than the social relevance ‘docur
mentary' photographers looked for.

Ostlind explained that one of the aspects of the per
sonal quality ot‘art'photography is that it becomes very real
for the viewer, It can, when dealing with the themes such
as love, sex, and death be, as he said, “’dirty' and somewhat
bohemian,”

The exhibit provides strong examples to support the
relevance and strengths of each. While much of the show
is devoted to images more in the ‘iirt’style of photography,
the poignant images orl<ent Klich’s series on Romanian orr
phans show the strength and impact that the ‘documentary’
sry1e__of photography can have on a viewer.

Ostlind ended the talk with Annee Olofsson's images,
which aie interesting because they seem to embody the cam,
bination ofboth styles. While maintaining much ofthe ‘ait'
tradition ofstaging photographs and perfecting an aesthetic,
they try to appeal to their viewers on a social level, engaging
them with the ideas of beauty and gender roles.

While it still may not be considered an ‘equal‘ art to the
more traditional forms, it is "the seductive characteristics of
photography," as Ostlind described it, that make this art so
intrtngntg, The exhibit will be up in the Faulconer Gallery
from January 28 until March 18.
