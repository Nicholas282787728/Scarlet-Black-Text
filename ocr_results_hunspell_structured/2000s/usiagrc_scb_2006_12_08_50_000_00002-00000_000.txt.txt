FTP helps turn Victoria green

BY DAVID MONTGOMERY

Jessica lantorr'o7 and Jon lrltnty'o7 wcrc Corleadcrs ofFl'ce
the Planet (FTP) two years ago when the group took on a new
cause: pressuring lingerie retailer Victuiia’s Sccrct to make its
catalogs more cco—friendly.

FTP's campaign was part ora larger effoit spearheaded by
a national group called Fot'estEthics. ironmentalists were
upset about paper rrbet rot catalogs coming from Canada's
boreal forest, an essential home for animals
like caribou. While individual activists like
those in FTP were staging public—awareness
stunts in front ofVictoi'ia‘s Seciet stores, the
ForestEthics leadership team was meeting
with executives from the parent company or
Victoria's Secret, Limited Brands,

On Wednesday, ForestEthics and Limits
ed Brands announced a partnership in which
Limited Brands committed to ecu-friendly
catalogs For Henry and Baron, it was per- foot timing.

“We've had 12 events in the campaign, and put a lot or
time and errort into it," Henry said “Finally, our- senior year
culminating with this great success is really solid."

Across the countiy, activists staged more than 750 “actions"
against Victoria's secret during‘the campaign. FTP‘s 12 ac-
counted for more than one percent.

Two former Grinnellians, Linda Wells '05 and Shana or?
man ’06, have worked at ForestEthics since leaving Grinnell,

FoiestEthics executive director Todd Paglia told the media
in a conference call Wednesday that the successful campaign
depended on an intricate balance between groups like FTP and
the central leadership. At the same time that ForestEthics wzis
compromising with Limited Brands, they had to “rake [serir
ously] ]the wishes of people in the campaign to have the best

Vigil, cont. from p. l
Rankin and Laura Cathey 09, the CBS Activities Coordr

nator, organized the vigil to commemorate the 1971 struggle.
Rankin said she was inspired to remind the student body ot
the struggle and pain that the people before us went through to
get to this point

Staiting at the Black Cultural Center (BCC), a procession
ofsrudents carried candles to Burling,wherc there was a Young,
Gifted, and Black (YGB) choir performance and discussions
about the impact of the actions taken 35 years ago. “People
came, they learned,” Rankin said.

CBS leadeis and other students have recently voiced coir

”Despite Whatyou may have

seen public/y, we had a great
partnership [with Forelem/‘rsj”

Brands Vite president

outcome possible."

The rrnal agreement, which both groups characterized as a
“beginning," saw Limited Brands agree to no longer buy abet
logged from an area of Canadian torest especially crucial to
endangered species. They will also make their catalogs out or
paper that IS 10 peicent cither recycled or certified as being
produced in an environmentally sustainable manner.

This falls short of the environmentalists original goals,
which called for a reduction in the number
of catalogs and paper made of 50 percent
eco—rriendly material.

“Each side gave a little," Paglia said.
He said ForcstEthics wanted to encourage
corporations to be environmentally friendly
without harming their profits.

Limited Brands Vice President Tom
Katzemeyer said his company was glad to
addpt green policies, He said that neither the
activist “actions" nor the change to etc-friendly paper would
have an effect on the company's profits.

“The way [FortstEthics] conducted their campaign allowed
us to focus on doing the right thing,” Katzeineyer said. “Despite
what you may have seen publicly, we had a great partnership.“

Henry thought ForcstEthics’s stiatcgy was a good one. “The
corporate campaign has the advantage of working Within the
market system," Henry said, “It's less like environmental polls
ties are being jammed down people's throats. I think in general
it’s been very effective."

Eaton agreed. “tryoute going to change policies, you may as
well do it at a corporate level,” Eaton said.“You have to respect
the tact that that's their job, to be profitable. Ityou want them
to change. you have to cornpromrse some ideals Butlthink
that in the long run, the effect is greater conservation."

Students say job' is still not finished

cetn about continuing problems such as the elimination orrlre
Africaiia Studies concentration and the danger to the BCC if
the Fitness and Athletic Center expands west

Cathey said students today were less involved than students
in the 19705. “Its a different experience,‘ ’Cathey said. “Then,
it was easy to find 30volunteers to help move books off the
shelves to the new Black Library You ve got nothing like that
now."

Rankin and Cathey said the 35th anniversary ofthe Burlr
ing takeover offered the perfect oppoitunity to reﬂect on the
struggles of past students and the progress that has been made.
“These are issues that affect us all, black and white," Rankin
said.“Change has been made, but there's still a lot to be done."
