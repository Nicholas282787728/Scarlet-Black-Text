AllcCampus Events Coordinator Lauren Wright 03 said
this week that she was concerned by a LACK OF AP-
PLICATIONS FOR ACE FUNDING this yeal: "There have
to be events every weekend,” she said, "and I can’t
plan all of them.” Wondering whether campus social—
izing might be caught in red tape, Associate Dean of

Residence Life Steve Larson reminded students that

alcohol contracu and wristband regulation is not nec-
essary for parties where students bring their own al~
coholic beverages . . . Joint Board discussed the
REMOVAL OF CLEVELAND SENATOR Matt Blake '04
from the ofﬁce to which he was elected against his
will. Blake, who won on a write-in vote after no can-
didate sought the position, has attended nb 38 meet~
ings, though another Cleveland resident has unofﬁ-
cially served in his place. SGA Administrative Coordi-
nator Liz Allan ’04 invoked a clause of the body;
constitution which permitted the removal of sena-
tors who failto attend three or more meetings, draw—
ing criticism rronr Gabe Rosenberg '03 (Haines).
Rosenberg argued that Blake should have been asked
to resign and worried that the constitution was be-
ing selectively enforced to meet the whims of cabi-
net members.

corrections

In its Sept. 20 issue, the 5&8 mistakenly reported
that "in an attempt to keep order” at a recent
party, Grinnell Police Department Sergeant and
Investigations Commander Randy Hansen
“handcuffed one student." Though ofﬁcers did
consider detaining one student who was causing a
particular disturbance, handcuffs were never used.
The article also incorrectly reffered to the sergeant
as an "officer" and to Captain and Acting Chief Tim
Sittig as “Chief of Police Tom Sittig.” The 588
regrets these errors
