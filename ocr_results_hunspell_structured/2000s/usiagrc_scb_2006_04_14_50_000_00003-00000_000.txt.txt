Chron: We’re rich, so what?

According to higher education source, Grinnell is the richest
liberal arts school, but what does that mean for poor students?

walkways made of gold, trees growing money and
caviar for dinner is far from the life of the average
Grinneliian. Yet, with its humble concrete sidewalks,
commonplace trees and beef stew, Grinnell holds the
title of “the nation’s wealthiest liberalrarts college"
according a recent article in 77;: Chronicle oing/Jer
Education. The article, written by
Goldie Blumenstyk,addresscs the
current ﬁscal state of Grinnell, its
spending habits, and its impact
upon the student body.

“i thought [the article] was
reasonable, accurate," said Jim
Sumner, dean of Admission and
Financial Aid. “I thought it was
reasonably clear; I thought it was
reasonably well-written.”

The article, featured as the
coverstoryinthcApril7editionof
thenationalpublication,expound~
ed upon the now 31.4 billion endowment and its im
pact upon student life. Citing recent building projects,
various research resources and monetary aid provided
to research and services projects, the arriclc reveals the
student-friendly, and very wealthy, face of Grinnell.
“Lthink that it painted a pretty positive, studentvorir
ented, service-oriented picture,” said Sumner.

SGA Student Service Coordinator Ptiya Malik
'06, who was quoted in the article agreed with Sum-
ner‘s assessment of the article in regards to student
life.

“When you read the article, it seems like
she deﬁnitely highlights the fact rhar we do
have a lot of facilities over here and we do
spend a lot of money on activities,” said Malik.

But along with the positive, student-oriented face
or Grinnell, the article broughr to light an issue that
many colleges ofGrinnell's peer institutions face: the
admittance oflow-income students. According to the

students.”

article, only 11.5 percent of Grinnell's student body
qualiﬁes {or Pell Grants, a fact rhat gives them a “fail-
ing grade" from Pell Institute scholars.

“There's a couple ofmys to look at it," said Sums
net in response to the indication of Grinnell’s fail-
ure to create diversity on a SOCiOTECOHOiﬂiC level. “I
mean, if one was to look at it, yeah, only about 15
percent ofour new students or: ﬁrs?
generation college students on the
other hand, that's more than double
what it was a couple of years ago."

Over the years, Grinnell has
taken steps to improve its availabil-
ity to lowdncome Smdenist Particle
pating in partnerships with com,
munitydoased outreach programs,
such as Posse and Qrestbridge, as
well as extending recruitment to
high schools with large populations
of low-income students, the college
continues to work on its socio-eco—
nomic diversity.

“What you see at a lot oftoprend colleges [is] this
sort of two kinds of students: mthel thoroughly 3m,
poverished and rather thoroughly rich students and
not much in between. Here we have a much more
even spread, so we do have thoroughly impoverished
students and a handful ofrathcr prosperous students,
but we have a pretty nice distribution," said Sumner

Even with a wide range of diversity, students still
feel Grinnell must continue to take action.

“1 think Grinneli is in a unique position to do
something about it,” said SGA Treasurer Matt Cleinr
man '06, “because ofout Endowment and because we
have needrblind admissions combined with commit-
ment to meet 100 percent demonstrate financial need
for domestic students."

Police offer new drug,
alcohol punishments

xv MERRICK MEYERS

Grinnell police, the local prosecutor's oﬂice and
college ofﬁcials are in the process of developing a
program that would provide alternative sentencing
for minor alcoholrrclated oFFenses.

Instead of going through the regularjustice system
and getting a criminal record, Powesheik County resi-
dents charged with these offenses will instead have to
successfully complcre an educational course and the
offense will not go on their criminal records.

“We think it’s gonna happen {or sure," said Tom
Crady, vice president for Student Services.

The plan would rake the form of an arrangement
with the prosecutor's ofﬁce under which a judge could
withhold additional punishmenr if the perpetrator is
rcfcrred lo the program.

The program would cover alcohol oFfenscs includ—
ing transporting open containers or alcohol, underage
drinking and public intoxication. More serious crimes
such as DU'l would not be covered and would be sen-
tenced in the normal way.

Crady estimated that 15 to 20 Grinnell students
are charged with alcohol related crimes each year.
Many occur at the border of campus and involve
transportation of open containers.

Similar programs have been attempted with suc-
cess in other areas. “This isn’t new to the criminal
justice system," said Grinncll Chief of Police Jody
Matherly, “but it’s new to Powesheik County”

Matherly said that this is part oran errorr by the
police to work with the student body to resolve prob
lems instead of being perceived as antagonists.

This arrangement would cover all residents of
Powcsheik County, notjust Grinnell College students.
High school students from the town of Grinnell are
also expected to be included in the program.

“I think the new policy is a good step as a per
tentially more eﬂ’ect‘ive method of preventing unsafe
alcohol use, which is the purpose orthe law in the ﬁrst
place," said Conor McGee '08.

The program will likely be in place by the fall
2006.
