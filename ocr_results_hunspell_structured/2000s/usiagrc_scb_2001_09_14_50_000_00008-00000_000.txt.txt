When I first laid eyes upon my hot, cramped living
quarters, that college administration dares to calla quad,
Iwas filled with a horror that even the late H.P. Lovecraft
would think unimaginable.

The living to a few days with my roommates only
worsened my fears. Each one is unbearably aggravating
in a different way. Tin always comes home late when
I‘m trying to sleep. Matt’s annoying Californian Wit drives
me up the walls then there is kyle, who lett his
backwoods Iowa town to grace me with his stories of
"Cedar Rapids.”

. My primary method of dealing with my roommates is
by avoiding them as much as possible. On weekends,
and days when Waking up before 10 am is not an issue,
Isleep in the Loose lounge on the comfy, comfy couches.
In fact, the next time you see me around campus, odds
are I won’t be in my room.

When I first saw thesroom in which I was to be living
for the next two semesters, I was sort of worried, It
looked awful cramped, and seemed pretty hot. I was
sure that any four people living together in there would
soon get on one-anothefs nervesa

Then I not my roommates. Immediately, all my tears
were assuaged. They were like wacky angels of mercy,
each with their own unique and wonderful personality:

Ned is such a goofhall, Matt is soooo smart and is \

glamorous because he's from California, and Tin is the
nicest person ever.

I knew from then on that what I thought to be
”cramped and hot" would simply be comfy, ﬁlled with
the warmth of love. Sure enough, my room has become
a haven of hope and happinessin this otherwise chaotic
and sometimes mean world.

I was up all night thinking or this question and I
couldn’t find a logical explanation. After all, I'm halfv
crazy: I do my homework an hour before class; spend
half my time lining up outside Quad or Cowles, and
the other half bitching about the food (that's what
they call it); niiss breakfast everyday because $3.50
at the express is worth more than 350 Dining Hall
meals; go to Harris movies and ﬁnd that they are out
of pop and popcorn; join every group on campus and
realizeI have no time to space out; and write insanely
long sentences (as if you couldn’t tell by now). And
this morning, in the middle of my Economics Class
siesta, I saw the answer: I fit the profile of a typical
Grinnellian!
