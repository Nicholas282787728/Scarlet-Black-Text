Speech highlights

Professor Deborah K. King on
Du Bois and gender

King criticized Du Bois's failure to acknowl-
edge the unique experiences of black women
in the l“prison house" of racist America, The
”prison house" referred to both the literal
incarceration of black females in the penal
system and the various techniques of social
control employed to relegate legally free
black Women to the status of prisoners, King
maintained that ”scholars too readily excuse
Du Bois' exclusion of black women" from his
analysis of the prison industrial complex,

The argument that "there was no gendered
analysis" at the time Du Bois wrote is un-
true, King said. ”There are lots of women of
the time that are wrestling with how the
various types of prison house affect their
lives." The premise that ”Du Bois was not at
a loss for black women’s perspectives” led
King to question what must have been Du
Bois’ conscious omission of black female
perspectives from his works

King said that Du Bois’s sociological inves-
tigation should have informed him of three
contexts in which black women experienced
the "prison house”: the penal justice sys-
tem, the sentencing of black women to do-
mestic labor, and "the prison house of the
politics of protection and respectability [in
which] bback women’s own homes became a
prison house.”

King hypothesized that Du Bois excluded
black women from his analysis of black corr—
victs because ofthe prevalence oianti-black
hysteria motivated by the myth of the black
male rapist oi the white female King said
that Du Bois focused on black male crime in

order to expose alleged rapes of white women
by black men as "victimless crimes” and to
save the lives of innocent black men Al-
though King saw this as an honorable en-
deavor, she said Du Bois ”ignore[d] the
wounded souls of black women."

Former Grinnell professor
Christopher Parker on African-
Americans in the military

Parker compared African-American veterans
to non-veterans in order to discern whether
military service impacted their attitudes
about American democracy, "African-Ameri-
cans have a dual allegiance. One to race
One to nation." Parker concluded that te
sion between being bback and being Ame
can in a nation that has systematically disr
enfranchised blacks is best observed in blacks
who have fought forAmericat "If double con-
sciousness is real, we should see it most
clearly in black veterans,” he said "I'm go-
ing to do my best to reify the double con—
sciousnessa"

Parker found that despite the persistence
of racial violence and discrimination upon
return to the United States, many black vet-
erans continued to feel patriotict "There has
to be a reason why these guys are so alle—
giant to America," he said ”Most of which
has to do with military socialization," Parker
said that this socialization has two compo-
nents, "egalitarian rhetoric" and "brainwash-
ing." According to Parker, “egalitarian rheto-
ric [was] reinforced by military socialization
thus creating citizens that were allegiant" to
America despite America’s failure to uphold
civil rights for black Americans.
