Kramac the munificent divines NBA trades

l have to reveal something, dear readers. I have a secret
abilityia power that few possess, Yes, like Encyclopedia
Brown and Rasputin, l have a special mental faculty: the
power to divine the response to a query from a sealed envee
lope. Johnny Carson had this power, and though he would
joke about it on his show, Carnac the Magnificent’s abilities
averted worldwide crises a number of times. You're probably
aware ofhis prediction about the role that Captain and Tent
nille's hit "Do That to Me one More Time"played in se-
curing the peaceful release of the American hostages
from Iran in the ’80s, as depicted in the madrfor-

TV movie “Carson, the Captain, and the Ayatole
lah: Don’t Do That to Me Any More Times."To
share my ability, I have asked a made-up person
to bring me some madeeup sealed envelopes
which contain a cosmic riddle that came to me
after the second time I got tricked into hufﬁng
paint in the Kum 3:. Go parking lot. Strangely
enough, they’re all pretty lucid, and since they
all have to do with NBA trades made before the
league’s recent trade deadline, they’re perfect for
this here sports column. I will divine the mean
ing of the riddle concealed in the envelope,
then open it and transcribe its contents.The

rirst envelope, please.

RiddIe: Name three things that make
more noise than the San Antonio Spurs
did before the trade deadline.

(In a dark cemetery somewhere, mufﬂed staccato guffaws
emanate from Ed McMahon’s grave.)

The Spurs have one of the NBA’s oldest rosters. Tim
Duncan is 33, Michael Finley is 36, Antonio Mchess is
35 and Manu Ginobili is 32.Though slightly younger, Tony
Parker (27 and coming off hip surgery) Richard Jefferson
(29) and Roger Mason (29) probably only have a few good

years left. 50 while the spurs are in good position to make

the playoffs this year, they will most likely be one of the bore

tom three seeds in the West, pitting them against superior,

younger teams that will easily outrgun them. If the Spurs

were a young team looking to gain playoff experience like

the Thunder or last year's Hawks, it would make sense for

them to sneak into the playoffs and lose in the first round

to the Lakers or Nuggets. The reasoning for leaving their

roster virtually untouched is, I imagine, that the Spurs’ front

office is deluded enough to believe this year's team can

Compete for a championship, despite sitting at 11th

overall in the league standings. It seems the Spurs

would rather be an average team now and a ter-

rible team within a few seasons than be only

kindeof bad now but with the chance to win a
championship within a few seasons.

But with a team as old as this one, there's

little logic against dumping some of the over-

29 section of the roster in trades for younger

players or future draft picks. Plenty of teams that

are actually contenders this year would love to add

some of those veteran players to contribute im-

mediately, and would probably trade away

their recent draftees in exchange. Through

trades, the spurs might have even been

able to trim enough fat from their pay

roll to compete in the 2010 free-agency

sweepstakes, a contest for the services of

some of the NBA’s most talented play-

ers. Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade, Carlos Boozer, Amar’e Stout

demire, Joe Johnson and The King himself, LeBron James.

To quote Vizzini, it’s inconceivable for the spurs not to try

to ship out some of their older players to make room for a

future star or possibly some of the above marquee names.

Moving Ginobili and Jefferson, who, combined, earn around

:25 million this season but score only 25 points per game,

would bring enough cash to interest a top-tier free agent.

Next envelope, please.

Kmmnr dimer; James Cameron's Avatar and the New
York Knicks

Riddle: What has stars that are blue, seven feet tall, cost
a ton of cash and exist in a harsh, unforgiving environment?

(More deep, obscquious laughter from McMahon. He is
dead tight? or am 1 thinking orWilford Brimley?)

The Knicks, currently owner of the league’s fifth-worst
record, were part of this year's blockbuster, multieteam deal
that dealt Nate Robinson to the Celtics for Tracy McGrady,
Sergio Rodriguez and Eddie House. on paper, the trade will
have almost no positive repercussions for the Knicks this
year, Their record will likely continue to falliI wouldn’t be
surprised if they have their second SOsloss season in a law.
To make it all worse, the one bright spot for Knicks fans,
McGrady, is so injured that he looks like John Grotberg ’09
trying to play in the NBA right now.

However, I really like the Knicks' trade deadline moves
this year. After they dump McGrady’s undeservedly gener-
ous contract, they will have the most salary cap room of any
team in the league. They're going all in on the free agent
class of this summer, and they freed up much of that room
by trading away frequent malcontent and fan—favorite (those
two traits tend to combine in New York) Nate Robinson and
adding Tracy McGrady’s astronomical, but very temporary
deal. The Knicks are going to pay T—Mac about :23 million
to do almost nothing this year, but it will be worth it when
they have enough money to pay for TWO maximum-salary
free agents. Imagine it; coach Mike D’Antoni's wide-open
offense ﬂying high with David Lee playing alongside LeB-
ron and Chris Bosh, or Dwayne Wade and Carlos Boozer, or
even Joe Johnson and Amare Stoudemire. With a success»
ful summer from their front office, the Knicks can add the
necessary pieces to become an elite team for years to come.
They can transform almost overnight into a title contender.
Oh, are we out of envelopes? Well, back to the Kum 8:. Go.
