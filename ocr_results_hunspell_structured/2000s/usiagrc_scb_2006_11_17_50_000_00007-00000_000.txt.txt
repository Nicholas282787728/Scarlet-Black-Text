The strategy of economic sanctions may
work when the target rs a small domain whose
economre suivival heavrly relres on foreign
aid, such as Palestine. However, it is not only
rneffcctrvc but dangerous if similar attempts
at “economic warfare" were to be applied
to China, a country that holds 13 billion
people and also hosts extensive American
interests Washington’s politicians are no
tools. Then what indeed is the intent, under
the camouflage of “pio ting democracy,"
of those Democratic pol‘ cians who have a
negative stance on a more open and normal
trade relationship with China?

One obvious answer comes from their
constituencies' lnteiests—thc tiade unions
that strongly favor economic protectionism.
Further, it sccms that many U.S. politicians
strll have a Cold War mentality, only
replacing the USSR with the PRC. All they
want and wish to do is to maintain the U.S.'s
monopolistic dominance against a rising
China as an cconom' and strategic “threat"
in the global geopolitical arena. However.
American rrrrilatcralism simply does not in in

a nurltipolarizing world.

Economic cooperation
with China does not help
sustain autocraty; on the
contrary, it erotics the basis
of autoctacy. It is naive to
irnagrne that ptotectivist
American economic
policies against China will
promote Chrnas democr

triumphant Congressional Democrats can
liberate themselves from the narrow-minded
interests or constrtucncy and the outdated
Cold \Nar incntality and lead America into
the right direction still remains to be seen.
