the shape ofout rotations has changed accordingly.”

The men's basketball team has had a strong season up to this
point, with a competitive conference record and only one loss at
home. Over the long break, the men‘s team went 5-2, including four
very important conference wins. Their lone conference loss_came
on the road at the hands of the undefeated Lawrence University
Vikings.

The game took place in front ofhuge audience, which included
students and fans watching the Internet broadcast, as well as the
packed Lawrence gymnasium in Appleton,Wis.The Pioneers gave
Lawrence in great game although they eventually fell to the Vikings
125410. Over the break, their record improved to 10-3 ovemll and
471 in Midwest Conference play.

John Grotberg'OQ has been leading the way for Grinnell, averagr
ing over 30 points per contest on his way to becoming one of the
toprscorcrs in the NCAA.

The points will certainly be needed down the stretch as Grinnell
has lost senior Paul Nordlund to a serious knee injury. Nordlund has
been a catalyst for the Pioneers all season and if the team hopes to
win a conference championship, they will have to ﬁnd a my to do it
without one of their captains on the ﬂoor.

“There is no my we can replace Paul,” said Grotherg. “His pres»
ence on the ﬂoor and the way he could control a game was unr
matched and his' injury is certainly tragic. However, despite his ab
sence on the ﬂoor, he s still showing his readership on the bench and

Although the men pulled offa close vicrory last weekend against
Lake Forest, they had a very tough lost against Knox this pastTuest
day, losing by a single point.

The Pioneers will have their first true test this weekend at home.
They will take on Carroll College in Darby tonight and they will
get a second chance against Lawrence with another home game this
Saturday Both teams are at the top of the conference and two wins
from the Pioncers would put them in the driver's seat for a playoff
berth.

“This weekend is big because we are going to be playing the two
teams that are ahead ofus in the conference,”s:lid Michael Schmidt
’03. “Winning our mmes this weekend would be a good way to gain
some ground and try to get ahead of them in the conference Stands
ings. Even though both Lawrence and Carroll are ahead ofus, ifwe
play how we are capable of playing we should be able to win this
weekend."

Paul Nordlund’s injury will certainly factor into Grinnell's game
plan. They will have to play their best basketball to come out of this
weekend unscathed and continue pushing toward their goals.

“My goals now are the same as they were at the start of the
season," said Head Coach Dave Arseneault. “I would like to win the
conference championship. Looking at comparative scores, it appears
that a couple of teltms may be better than us, but Ive been around
long enough to know that anything can happen.

Pioneers look to even conference record over Weekend

BY KEVIN BYRNE

While many students spent their winter break res
laxing and catching up on sleep, the Grinnell women's
basketball team practiced for a month and a half and
played it total of eight games. The squad went 375
over the break, including two wins at home. However,
after dropping three road conference games in a row,
it will be a difﬁcult climb for the Pioneers to get back
near the top of the Midwest Conference.

“We have had a rough couple of weeks and I don’t
thiilk any of us are happy with our record," said Mad-
dy Raimondo ’08. "However,l think we all realize that
we have been really close in so many gamesl think
every team’s goal is to be playing their best ball at the
end of the season and that is what we are working
towar .”

The Pioneers have indeed been close in many of
their contests, dropping four oftheir five losses by less
than 10 points. They defeated an inexperienced Cor-
nell team on Dec. 10 by eight points and followed
that With a seven-point loss to Duna College in Net
braska on Dec. 17.

On Jan. 7, Grinnell picked up a big win it home
against conference opponent Illinois College. Hans
nah Wolf 0’8 and Katy Bowen '06 led the way with
19 and 18 points respectively.

The following week the Pioneers droppcd three
straight road games to Monmouth, Lawrence and St.
Norbcrt. Grinnell played their host basketball against
Lawrence, giving the tough conference opponent a run

for its money, keeping the game within reach through
the ﬁlial minute wolfhad a total on9 points during
the game and Emily Kolbc '07 contributed 15 points
in the sixtpoint loss.

After an exciting onerpoim hometcourt victory
over Loras College, Grinnell lost another close coli—
fcrence gatnc, this time to Lake Fol-est college. wolf
put up another 29 points and Bowen had 20 points in
the 73-65 loss.

The Pioneers picked up another important con—
ference win against Knox this past Tuesday in Illi-
nois.The team is now preparing for its most difficult
weekend of the season. Thc women will face perent
nial contender Carroll College tonight in the Darby
Gym and on Saturday afternoon they have :1 home
game against Lawrence.

“This weekend we play two very good teams and
i think it will take our best effort to win,” said Lauren
Meredith '06. “i expect us to come out playing hard
and give both Carroll and Lawrence trouble.

Head Coach Andy Hamilton also understands
the importance of this weekend's games in terms of
term success and creditahility.

“The games this weekend against two ot’ the top
teams in the league are impoltant from the onntl’
point ol defending your home court in the MW
said Hamilton. “At this point in the season we are just
focusing on one game at a time and not the standings.
iruc ﬁnd success one game at n nn‘llf,0\li finish in the
standings will take care nfitsclf."
