THIs NEEDS A TITLE!

”The overall impression created by the DZ is
that of an internment camp.”

The Demonstration Zone (DZ) was also
dubbed the ”Free Speech Zone” at the Demo-
cratic National Convention. It was the only area
convention organizers set aside ror protestors to
be within sight and sound of delegates as the
entered the Fleet Center. But ”internment camp"
was not a comparison coined by protesters.
Rather, the words were penned by us. District
CourtJudge Douglas Woodlock.

Protesters sued WHO??? over the constitu-
tionality of the DZ and the case was decided by
Woodlock. He had a lot to say about his fact-
ﬁnding visit to the DZ in his ﬁnal ruling. And,
having visited the same site during my time in
Boston, I believe we shared some reactions while
inside.

”The DZ was built out on or about [sic] Mons
day, July 19; before then it had been covered by
debris and construction material,” he wrote, and
you could tell. "Most—at least two-thirds—of
the oz lies under unused [railroad] tracks. The
tracks create. . . a grim, mean, and oppressive
space whose ominous roof is supported by a for
est of girders" decorated with razor wire which
palpably declares to all below that they are on
the wrong side of the tracks,

Near one entrance ”a person of normal height
could not carry a sign underneath the girders

ELI ZIGAS

without lowering it to head level or lower,"

Not that the sign would be of use. "The DZ
is surrounded by two rows of concrete jersey
barriers. Atop each of the jersey barriers is an
eight-toot high chain link fence. A tightly woven
mesh fabric, designed to prevent liquids and
objects from being thrown through the fence,
covers the outer fence, limiting but not eliminat-
ing visibility.”

That's not all. It wouldn’t be a cage without a
lid. “From the top of the outer fence to the train
tracks overhead . . . is a looser mesh netting."

Similar description continues for pages in
Judge Woodlock’s decision, but he summarizes
his concern in a short few sentences. "Let me be
clear: the design of the DZ is an offense to the
spirit of the First Amendment. It is a brutish and
potentially unsafe place for citizens who wish to
exercise their First Amendment rights."

The oz was designed by the police and Secret
Service as a "free speech zone." The DZ is ems
blematic of the threats to civil liberties we face
in a time when our country is becoming more
polarized each month. Judge Woodlock, for a va-
riety of reasons, allowed the DZ to remain. Most
protestors rejected this affront to democracy by
demonstrating elsewhere.

Ijoined them. I’m hoping that, even if you
didn’t see it personally, you will reject it too.

LIz CARRIER

At times, being in the Fleet
Center felt like being at a giant
pep rally for John Kern]. There was
a photo exhibit or kerry, in only
his most photogenic campaign
trail moments, posted on the
third floor. Even when the audi—
ence wasn’t listening closely to a
speech (during most non prime-
lime speeches), the crowd roared
with approval whenever Kerry or
Edwardsl names were mentioned.

In keeping with the unnaturally
upbeat feel of the Convention,
most speeches I heard lacked hard
content on political issues. How—
ever, I heard over and over how
John Kerry was a "man of principle
and values” etc. The recitations of
Kerry/s military record got a little
tiring.

Since signs were passed out en
masse to the audience dun'ng the
prime time speeches, I am now the
proud owner of a ”Kerry—Edwards
for a Stronger Amen’ca" sign and
a "We [heart] Teresa” sign. In be-
tween each speech, sound system
speakers blasted out music, and
most people around me started to
dance,

It felt sort of forced and awk—
ward, especially considering most
or the delegates looked to be at
least middleeaged. The huge screen
on stage flashed pictures of old
people dancing clumsily.

Police were everywhere. I found
it helpful to have all the officers
around sometime (namely when 1
got lost walking through Boston),
but it also put me on edge all or
the time. Maybe Ijust have an
overactive fear of authority, but all
the police made me uncomfortable,

There weren’t as many protest—
ers around the Fleet Center during
the convention. I expected masses
or people outsid ,. mostly con-
servatives bashing Kerry. Ispent

a while walking around the ”Free
Speech Zone” two nights, and there
couldn’t been more than 30 people
in there at one. time, and most of
them seemed to be proclaiming
Jesus and not advocating either
political Candidate,

Walking around Boston, I stume
bled upon a huge protest in Boston
Commons. There seemed to be more
left-wing groups than right—wing
ones in the Commons. Two people
walked around silently, each dressed
as a flip-flop--an obvious reference
to Bush’s characterization of Kerry
as a ﬂipsflopper.

Throughout Boston, the antie
war and proelire movements were
prominently featured. Most of the
protests had some sort of anti-war
or ’get the troops out‘ theme, and
I spent a couple of hours one day
following pro-life trucks with huge
pictures of fetuses on them in
hopes of getting good picture for
the 585.

The whole time I was in Boston,
I always felt a little out of place.
During the protests, not only was I
was carrying around a camera and a
media badge trom the convention,
but I simply was not dressed "radie
Cal" enough to look like most of the
protesters, In contrast, within the
convention and different college—age
democrat meetings, I felt completely
con); dressed, as I was not wear-
ing some sort of power suit or skirt.

In the end, the DNC met most
expectations. It felt great to be a
huge room almost completely sur~
rounded by Democrats (not that it
doesn't happen at Grinnell). On the
other hand, Iwas sort of disap-
pointed with the police state in
Boston and the lack of discussion of
issues and ideas at the convention.
Overall, too much pep rally, not
enough real discourse on the issues.

Candidates for school

School Board, cont. from p. 4

Cuthcins snys “the really lntcl‘CSlT
ing Incc” is the one between Hendricks

DcAngclo, saying rhnr tlic incumbcnr
“ought To stay on. She hns done a great
job as a school board member."

Without having to focus on getting
elected. Cutchins has nlrcndy consid
ered his goals in ofﬁce. His main objee
live Is to “get a handle on budget issues
that have arisen from declining enrolle
merit."

He referred to rnnny cuts that have
had to be Inndc reccnrly and empha-

sized [hat in the future he wanted cuts
to be n Community affair. He envisions

and community members coming r a
gcthcr “to say ‘VVlmr are our top prior-re
ties) What are the sacred cows no one
wants to see touched?”

The Director of Social Commits
