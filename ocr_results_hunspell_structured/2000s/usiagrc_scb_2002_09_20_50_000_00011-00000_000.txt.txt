Defacing self-
governance

l've got a bone to pitk with eertain members ofthe student body
Everyone keeps saying, “Grinnell’s going to shit.” Fine, things are
ehanging. Some ofus aren’t happy about it, but we do have eontrol
ofsome things, namely mkingrc-

sponsibiliry for our aetioiis.

What am I talking about?
speeifieally, I’m referring to the
signs in Cowles that have been
torn down or defaeed in the last
week or so. i am not a member
ofanyorthe groups whosework
has been assaulted, but i am
deeply offended and deeply dis.
appointed in this kind ofbehav.
ior

Asign advertising for die “so
Year: is Enough" Teacheln tour
that our fellow students have
been working hard to bring to
crinnell this week was torn
down and erumpled up. Asign

The idea of self-gover-
nance has been inter-
preted to mean, ”you
can do whatever you
want." I think a lot of
us are missing the
point. People, if we
want to be treated like
adults we need to act
like adults

posted by FTP about Citibank
was written on,

Now, I am not against people speaking their minds, Everyone
has the right to express his or her opinions 1 find it outrageous that
no one bothered to take aeeounrability for the defaeemenr of the
FTP sign, and that someone would have the audacity to tear down
signs that one of men fellow students put their time and effort into
beeause they eate about a eause, Why not put rip your own Sign?
lnelude your user name And be prepared to intelligently argue your
point. What ever happened to self-governance? The idea ofselfegove
ernanee has been interpreted to mean, "you ean do whatever you
want.” i thinkalotofus are missing rho point. people, ifwe want to
be treated like adults we need to aet like adults. We need to be ae—
eountable for our opinions and aetions. Everyone is entitled to have
their voiee, but how do you expect anyone to listen and understand
you if they don’t know who you are and eannor hear your point of
View?

feel that the sdssrafrdid not live up their responsibility to represent
the faers with fairness and aeeumey, Sexual assault allegations and
the procedures and polieies surrounding them are somplieated, scn»
slave and divisive, and the failure to mediate the opinions presented
in the ankle iepiesents an egregious error. The following is jusrone
example of the ways in whieh quotes in this airiele aie used in an
inappropriate and irresponsible way:

We believe that the eorninents made by Katya Glbcl Azoulay

Chiding children’s
terature

Dear Ms. sehuna,

i am writing in regards to your random rant which appeared in
the so}; in the first edition of the semester entitled “Think of the
Children." 1 fear that instead of raking your heading to heart, you
got eonfused and instead “Thought Like a Child," Now i undcre
stand you are new to Grinnell and perhaps aren't yet fatniliar with
what's available to you but i advise you in the future, before spouting
ofr about not having aeeess to ehildreri's books, to eonsider daese
options:

l. stewart Libmry: Loeated on Broad street in downtown
Grinnell, Stewart Library houses hundreds ofehildren's books rings
ing from pieture books, to beginning readers. to ehapter bookse
you name it they probably have it... and by going to the library in
town you can beeorne more familiar to the other resources that are
available to you outside the conﬁnes of campus

2. lLL. lnrer.Libiary Loan: Believe it or not, ifBurling doesn't
have it more is a good ehanee you may just be able to have them
borrow it from another library for you That's right, you put in the
request and they try and obtain it for you... having done researeh
with ehildren's books in the past, I know for a faer mar this works.

3. Talk to a librarian: Did yeti ever think to stop and ask one or
the referenee librarians or someone who works in the library why
there are no young adult or pierure books amongst the sraeks.> Go
ahead. l date you Here at Crinnell although people like to com»
plain, nothing is going to get done ifyou don't ask.

Also, seeing as though i ant someone who is quite fond ofHarry
potter and earned eredir at Gt inneil by designing aenrrieuluin around
the first book, please don’t get on the ease of those who have not yet
had an opportunity to piek up Ms. Rowling's books. Remember,
when they were iust beeoniing popular. you were in junior high or
maybe high sehool. A signifieant poition ofthe generd population
had to go baek and revisit their ehildhoods to find the book and
treasure itiyou were already there.

And perhaps the inosrdisrurbing thing i found about your “rant"
was the faer that you want to write ehildren's literature yer blatantly
tall it iluff, “it‘s niee to have some,..fluffier sort of reading." People
who refer to children’s literature as fluirare people who should not
be iviitiiig ehildreii’s literature. .' fast in going to go as fares to
say that people who use sueh demeaning voeabulaty in regards to
this eseeptional genre should not even go anynvlteie near children,

Childrens literature is far from fluff, Ms. sehuna, iris the foune

darion upon ivhieh a lifetiinelove ofreading can be formedaswell as
an important and highly valuable tool widtin eonremporary class»
rooms. Children‘s books eontain repetition and rhyme to help cmcr—
gent readers, eolorful pietures and unique artistry that draws the reader
in; as well as some new revolutionary pieees that inelude scaffolded
test and nonbias perspeetives on issues found throughout American
History and our every day lives.

books like “My Two Daddies" and “A Rainbow at Night: The
World in Words and Riernres by Nuvaio Children" by Bruce Hucko
would have been a rare find twenty yeais ago. These are the books
ehildien read at one of their most pivotal and influential stages of
development We out be produeing “ﬂuff" for them; we need to be
eieatiiig books like Chris van Allsburg's “The Wreek of the Zephyr"
or “The Boy Who Swallowed Snakes" by Laurenee Yep.

Children’s literature is rape
idly beginning to appear in not
only elementatyelassrooms but
in iunior high, high sehool, and
eollege eourses. Why? It’s

People who refer to
children’s literature as

simple; these books allow people
of all ages to gain a bener and
elearer understanding of dim.
eult eoneepts. For example, let's

Bk: 2 look at “The True Story

of the 3 Little Rigs," retold to
Jon Scimkz. This book is often
used to help studeno gain a better understanding of the American
legal system. in dassrooms aeross the nation, students put "Ttholf"
on trial for his erimes against ‘TheThree Little Pigs." seiesdtas book
is not “ﬂuE” but rather a mluable learning and teaehiug aid that is
helping learners grasp onto a eonoept that at one time baffled and
eonfused daem.

Now 1 am not saying 1 am an expert on ehiidren’s literature nor
am i saying you are ignorantt What i am saying is that too often
people on this eampus complain and b‘tch and moan about daings
and never do anything about it. I know you are new andl know that
you still have a lot to learn; however b-tehing about it isn't going to
make it better, DO SOMETHING! ACT ON IT! Go to SGA start
a dub/organization for people who want to write ehildrens litera.
ture, You’d be amazed at what extraordinary and unique people you'd
meet, And there is no better forum to share your work then with
those who share the same passion for it that you do. I’ve been in.
volved on this eampus for too long to let another person slip away
into eomplaining mode for fouryears and b:yondt You havea ehanee
to save yourself but the ehoiee is yours.

Overstepping
boundaﬁes

These eomments eoneern last weeks so}; nrriele reflecting on
the sexual miseondust allegations against Paul Ford and the events
related to these allegations. in the May 3, 2002 edition of the son
Cable and Walsh reported that, if true, the allegations against Ford
eould be eonsidered a third degree sexual abuse elass C felony. While
there are perhaps situations in which Grinnell College should at
tempt to hold students responsible for their aerions, it is inappropri—
ate for any College board to hear eases relating to evenu that may be
eonsideted felonies under lowa state laws. Hearing sueh eases makes
a moekery of those events, the people involved, and any prineiples or
iusriee. Flank Thomas questioned son's “due proeoss" in requesting
Ford's resignation, but felt that the Hearing Board's aetions and pro.
eess were sueeessful. it makes me wonder why the campus is not
outraged.

Who sates that Ford resigned from SGA? This is not a question
of losing rate in a student group; there is a reason that lowa laws
would elassify these aetinns as a felony. lfa dead body turned up on
