My confirmation hearings

Like many ofyoii, I spent part of the winter break watch-
ing the confirmation hearings ofSamucl Alito, nominee for the
us. supreme court. And as I watched Alito parry the various
questions, avoiding any substantial commitment to abortion
rights or affirmative action, I had one overriding emotion.

No, I’m not jealous of Alito for his powervthe fact that
he’ll soon be in a position to put restrictions on women’s rights,
or that he may cast the deciding vote in a legal challenge to “His
versiry admissions praenees. Ruthenl’m jealous orAlito for his
wife: the sweet B/Iill‘lhtl’Ann, who sat behind him during the
hearings, proudly supporting him at every moment and weep-
ing with love when he was asked if he was a bigot. My resentr

ment toward the judge grew even grertter when I read a proﬁle

of l\4r5. Alito in the New Yin-ll Timer.
“Oh, Mavis,”l sighed to my wife, “why
can't you be more like Mrs, Alito? It says

“Let’s see, within 20 minutes your front 1er had blown out
and i was unscrewing the lug nuts on the wheel."

“You replaeed them in less than 15, my little greasernon-
key. But more important, did you immediately know that l was
yotir life partner, your i-ziiran d Em,
the man who would give meaning to.
your existence?"

“I knew that you drove a Dodge
omni with rheap radials." “

This was exactly the kind ofcrilcl
insight that made Mrs. Alito, with
her suppliant eyes and modest cream-colored suit, appear even
more fetching.

“Mrs. Alito spends her free time driving her daughter to

swrrn practice,“1 haughtily remarked. “Ma-
vis, why don’t you drive Junior to swim pracr
rice?"

What devotion! What feminine sacrifice!"

“The county closed the pool after that
last tax cut. But, ifit makes you feel better,l
drive Junior every day to her $5.50/hour job

Hmmm . .. driving to Dollar-Mart didn’t
seem that noble. Perhaps I could shame Ma-

bathroom, a task that surpassed my own
limited mechanical skills. As I handed her
an adjustable wrench, I beat down and spoke louder.

“Mrs. Alito says that she knew she would marry her huss
band within 20 minutes ofmecting him for (he first time. Mar
vis, did you know that you would marry me within 20 minutes
ofour first date?"

vls into imitating Mrs. Auto's charity work,
“Mrs. Aliro raises money for her daughr
ter's athletic program, She even sponsored a pasta party for the
team. Why don’t you do that kind of fundraising for junior's
activities?
"Because I spend most or my time ﬁindraising for our next
mortgage payment, not to mention Junior’s last medical bill.

And don’t forget our strident loans—I bet that woman doesn't
have such debt.m

How presumptious ofMavisl I’m sure thatwhen Mrs. Alrto
attended the University of Kentucky in the early 1970s, tuition
was in [Mr] 3200 per semester! But
why squabble over the woman's rrr
nancial difﬁculties when it was her
moral character that was so exem-
plary?

“According to this article, Mrs.
Alito teaches religious classes at her
church. Dear, why don't you teach Sunday School?"

“I’m Jewish, remember?”

Details, details! sensing that I was getting nowhere with
this line of attack, I turned to my ultimate recourse—the ques-
tion that would decide for certain just what kind of spouse 1
had.

“Mavis, would you break down weeping if someone asked
me ifl was a closer bigot?"

“Honey, I think you came out or that closet when you had
me build the anti-immigration fence around the house. Now, if
you don't mind, could you hand me that hose coupling?"

See? How can I possibly attain the heights of success that
I clearly deserve, when I am married to surh a strong, inde-
pendent-minded woman? But I haven't yet abandoned hope,
Even if the symbolism of Mrs. Aliro was lost on Mavis, I can
still bring forward the example or another former librarian
whose self-denial and unquestionlng devotion to her husband
should be a model to women everywhere
