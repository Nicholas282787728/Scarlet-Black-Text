Immigration symposium tackles local issues

Three documentaries introduce symposium on controversy and conflict over Latino immigration

av SARAH MlRK

Most Rosenﬁeld symposiums are composed pri»
marily of esteemed lecturers and panel discussions.
Instead, next week’s symposium covering the trends,
issues and widely differing perspectives surrounding
the rising tide of Latino immigration to the United
states will kick off with campus showings of three
documentary films.

“For many of us, concepts like rhe border, in
documented immigrants and domestic workers seem
abstract or, unfamiliar,” symposium organizer Anna
Murphey loo wrote in an email to the scan, Using
these films, Murphcy and the other organizers said
they hope to give Grinnellians context about some
of the basic local and national issues which make up
the “big picture” ofrecent immigration to the United
States.

Friday’s ﬁlm,Ri hts on the Line: Vi ilantes at the
Border will be especially pertinent to one of the main
themes running through the week-long symposium:
the controversies and sometimes violent conﬂicts
arising from illegal immigration. “An average of 1

crmall. “Undocumented immigration is not an issue
that can be ignored."

With knowledge and context from the weekend's
documentaries. the organizers hope thnnell students
and staffw‘ill be able to attend the most anxiously ane
ncipated event ofthe symposium. on Tuesday night.
the symposium will host a debate
between Mark Grey, director of
Iowa Center for Immigrant Lead-
ership and Integration and Chris
Simcox, co—founder of the Mine
ureman Civil Defense Corps, a
group which has been making na-
tional headlines after committing
itself to ending the “mobs of ILLEGAL aliens who
endlessly stream across U.S. borders“ through direct
civilian action at the U.S./Mexico border, according
to the group's website.

“I hope that students can get an appreciation of
what is going on at the U.S./Mexico border and to be

able to make the connections to how it affects Iowa
and the rest of the United States," said Luis Fernan-
dez, Sociology. “Immigration is a timely issue right
now, since Congress is getting ready to start debatr
ing President Bush’s proposal for a potential amnesty
plan'and more funding for the militarization of the
border," he added. “It is a good time for us to pause
and think through the intricacies and implications‘of
thesc Issues."

The symposium will finish
up with another effort to place
the issue of immigration in the
minds and hands of Grinnell stu—
dents. Arizona Congresswoman
Kyrsten Sinema (D) will lead an
“activism workshop" dealing with
what role stares can and should play in the debates, as
well as the intersection of immigration policies and
human rights.

The ﬁrst documentary ﬁlm will run tonight in the
Forum south Lounge at 4:15 p.m. Filmmaker Ray

On December 11, a week after they
unveiled “secrets," an anonymous fo-
rum on Plans, the Plans administrators
announced that they would screen ﬁl—
tute Secrets posts. The announcement
said that they “would make some sort
of. ‘oﬁicial statement’ later, including
rationale for the change and the crite-
ria we will use when deciding whether
or not to display a secret.” Nearly six
weeks later, secrets are being altered
but neither an oﬂicial announcement
nor an explanation has been released.
in the first days after Secrets was
made an ofﬁcial part of Plans, a ﬂurry

Postman ’08 said

that the absence

ofpublic guidelines for how secrets

were censored was "a classic Grinnell

administration move. [They] say, ‘Uh,

we'll explain later.’ [It's] a short-term

appeasement and a failure to follow
through.”

Other students were less harsh.
“The ﬁltering is a decent attempt to ,3,
turn Secrets to what it was supposed to
be used for," said Mike Billups ‘07.

began screening Secrets, the content
posted has shifted from the freerforrall
of its first days, Over the past month,
there has been a mix of actual secrets
and wide-ranging discussions on mare
ters ranging from class issues to body
image. Most discussions were about
sex.

Some felt that Secrets isn’t worth
keeping around. Paul Kramer ’09 said
he didn’t think Secrets was a good fo-
rum for discussion. “Secrets represents
the unspoken subconscious of maybe
15 people who really enjoy saying a lot
of things on Plans," he said.
