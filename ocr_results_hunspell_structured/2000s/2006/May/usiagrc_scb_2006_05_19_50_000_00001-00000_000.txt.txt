Many people mlght be cxclrcd about the
choice of Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack to be
the commencement speaker Monday, but
Nick Fogg'oo is not one of them. "Hc seems
likejust another milquetoast politician," Fogg
said. “Knox College is getting Stephen Cole
bert, which is really cool. But that's not for
us,l guess."

The commencement selection committee
of current seniors was given the task of find’

different concerns. Many seniors want a big
name who Will entertain them, but the com,
mittee also wanted to bring in someone with
whom seniors could relate. Looming over
the entire proceedings is the issue of honor
rariums, for which Grinncll is comparatively
silngy with only $10,000.

"We wanted a speaker who hadn‘t may-
be just heard of Grinnell, but understood
Grinnell," said Ben Johannsen '06, a member
ofthe committee. “We wanted someone who
understood what it means to be in Iowa, but
also to have a more national perspective."

The committee saw Vilsack as meeting
those characteristics. Vilsack, who is nearing

is widely seen as a potential candidate for the
2008 Democratic presidential nomination
and was considered for the Vicerprcsidcntial
spot in the 2004 election. Vilsack will not be
receiving any money for his speech.

Grant \Voodard ’06, a member of the
committee, is enthusiastic about Vilsack. “He
really understands the difference [between]
Grinnell and other places,"VVoodnrd said.

Jolmniisen was also excited. “We feel that
[Vilszick's] a national leader within our bore
deis We hope that he inspires action to
ward resolving issues that Grinncllians are
passionate about."

The selection committee solicits sugger
tions from the senior class, and narrows it
down to a shortlist of 10 speakersThis list is
then sent to the faculty for approval, because
the commencement speaker almost always
receives an honorary degree.

The process takes a long time, since the
committee can only contact one potential
speakci at a time. “First we tried to get Jon
Stewart, but that wasn't possible," said Wood-
ward with a laugh. “Every single college in the
country wants him."

Woodard encouraged students to “put
pressure" on the tiustees to raise the bones
raritinr “They understand the Price tor some
ofthese higmame speakers rhrr pcoplc would
like to see," he said. “$10,000 is absolutely
nothing in rhc spcakers‘wor-ld,"
