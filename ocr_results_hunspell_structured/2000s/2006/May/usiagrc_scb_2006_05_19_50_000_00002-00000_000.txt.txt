Quiet student finds voice in theatre

Mike Claveria, a Math major and wrestler,
never expected to like being on stage, espe-
cially so late in his college career.

But when
his adviser en-
couraged him to
branch mltduting
his senior year,
Cleverie found
a way in which to deal with some of he sat
cial unease: theatre. Having taken nearly only
math and computer science classes before,
Clavena signed up for “Acting and Moving"
with Shawn Womack. Despite intitinl hesita-
Lion, Ciavcria surprised himself. “I really liked
it," he said,

gested that he try out for the upcoming the—
atre production irnpass. “I didn’t expect to get
in, but 1 did," says Clavetia,“1mpass was neat
because we wrote our own stories and acted
them out.”Clavetia had to learn how to speak
his opinion in front ora large group of people
and project his voice.

"1 had some trouble in the beginning bee
cause they said I didn’t speak loud enough,"

admitted Claveria. Assistant Professor of
Theatre Lesley M. Dchueuico would go into
a corner of the theatre and ask Claveria to
speak to her, in order to en-
courage him to talk louder,

“I really learned a lot,"
Claveria said. “It helped me
to speak out. Usually I stay
by myself, so it was a really
good experience for me.”

A native of Hawaii,
Claveria admits that it took
some time for Grinneli to
grow on him. “i would wear
like five layers of clothes
when it was only like so
degrees.” says Claveria. “At
first I didn't like it here, but
the more I think about it.
I might actually miss this
place."

Admittedly introverted, Cleveria found
the small size of Grinnell consoling. “I’m the
type of person who needs a community in or-
der to function well," Claveria said. “I’m not
too social."

The benefits of the experience soon
showed up in everyday life as well, “This
last semester I’ve been a little more social
with people who I might see in class but
don’t necessarily say hi to," he said,

“1 make some errort to try to talk to
these people Things I normally don't
do," says Clavetia. Nett year Claveria will
be attending iowa State for a graduate de
gree in both Statistics and Computer Sci-

cnce.

He hopes to use
his newfound ﬁbll’
ity to express himself
to his advantage in
the future, While he
doesn't know if he’ll
have time for theatre,
he said that it has en-
couraged him to try
new things and meet new people

“i know it is really important to be
close with people and the professors, and
work well with others," says Claveria, “i
think coming here was a good experience
for me."
