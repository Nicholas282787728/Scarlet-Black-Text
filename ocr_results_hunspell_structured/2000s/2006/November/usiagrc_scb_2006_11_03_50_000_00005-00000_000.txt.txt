The idea for a campus drag extravaganza came to Indi
Vazquez '07 last semester after viewing a drag show at the ant
nual Midwest Bisenial Lesbian Gay Transgendered Ally Cole
lege Conference (MBLGTACC), Inspired by the fun and ins
tcraci‘ivc show, she thought it would be a great idea to bring
what she called “an important component ofqueer culture" to
the Grinnell campus.

Early this semester, Vazquez hiought her idea for a drag
show to the residents of Multicultural Manoi, the campus
owned house where she lives, She also sent e-mails to the mem-
herships ofvarious multicultural and GLBT student organiza-
tions. Many of the people who signed on are active in one or
rnoie ofthe organizations, and many also live in Multicultural
Manor, so the various groups, especially Quiet People of Color
(QPOC) and the new Transgender Advocacy Group (TAG),
worked with the house to plan the event.

Although Grinncll students are used to cross»drcssing at
the popular Mary B. James partv, Vazquez noted that drag has
an entirely diffeient focus. At Mary B. James slic said there is

“no underlying political statement in many peoples minds."

Performing drag, she said, is a political statement that gen,
der is a show. which serves to deconstruct the gendci dichot~
orny and disrupt conventional gender stereotypes. “The queer
community has historically forced people to question gender
norms and made people think twice about their own assumpe
rions about gender," Vazquez said.

“Drag is very liberating to me,” said Vazquez, who has cone
templated pursu g a career as a professional drag king. “Gem
der fuck and taking on a mule persona is very fulfilling to me.
I enjoy it very Immensely.” Vazquez said that drag relates to
GLBT issues, especially transgendcr issues, because it “can pro
vide a sense of comfort for those who are gender variant to

exploit that side ofl t hemselves.

With the tips the peiformcrs earn, the organizers hope to
raise enough money to provide the campus with free HIV test-
ing during the week of Nov 27 to Dcc. 1. For this goal they
are teaming up with the Health Center, which will already be
providing testing for 510, lialfof the college's usual fcc, during
the week.

The show will feature lip synthing and dance performanc-
es to music by artists like lieyonce. Prince and Eryknli Badu.
There will be 10 performances by nine performers, with mic
or two performers per act. The show will also include an the
core appearance by Courtney Moore ’09, aka Marissa Beverly,
who was the winner of last year’s Mary B. James crossedressing
contest. His fellow performers have also taken on snazzy drag
names like Jackawanda lonts, Papa Cherry and Mike Hunt.
Most performers have not had previous experience with drag.

Although the organizers had originally planned to bring in
professional diag kings and queens, they ran into difficulties
communicating with professional groups. Vazquez said that
professional drag performers are rare in rural Iowa. They had
communication problems with a group in Des Moines, and
found out that the main Chicago group recently disbanded
They decided to continue without featuring professionals."Wc
can all be amazing drag people too," said Lindsay Robinson '09,
one of the performers and the spokesperson foi QPOC.

Many of the performers expressed excitement about the
show. Wesley Jenkins '09 is particularly motivated by his unique
role in the drag show. “I'm one ofthe few queens," he said.

The drag show takes place tonight in the Harris Concert
Hall, beginning at 10 pm. There will also be a workshop at
4:15 in vorrnktr Lounge which will provide information about
the history of drag and its importance within the queer move
ment
