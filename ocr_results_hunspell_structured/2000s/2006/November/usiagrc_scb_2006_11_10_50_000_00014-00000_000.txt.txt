Gridders finish
on high note
with big win

3v CHLOE MORYI.

Sit smiling seniors walked offRoscnbloom
Field last Saturday. Bud Baumgartner, Ramiro
Carrillo, Maury Noonan, l\'ino Parkel, Sean
Pfalzer and Matt “Tiny" Vigil ended their ca-
reers with a 39»22 victory over Beloit College.

Qlal'ltrbilck Pfalzer led the team with 351
passing yards and 129 rushing yrrds, accounts
ing for ﬁve total touchdowns. “It was ideal how

it turned out,"he said.“Sending the seniors oil”

with a Victory and having parents, students and

a couple of alums there to support us."
Noonnn returned to play in Saturday’s

game after sustaining an injury to his hams

string against Lawrence in the fourth week or

the season.

“Even though my last play ended with ll
penalty, I have a lot of other great memories
with the team," Noonan said. “It was good to
see both sides orthe ball play so well in the
ﬁnal grnne otthe season."

Bautngartnet also came back from an in,
jury that put him on the bench much of the
year to contribute to the win with nine tackles.
While the win was great for Baumgartner and
the seniors, he points out its importance to the
rest ofthe team.

“It wns a great thing for the underclasSr
men," he said. “We were glad to give them a
springboard into next season."

Among the returning players next year will
be Ben Remington ’08 and Kyle Perry'os, who
each caught two touchdowns on Saturday.

"The seniors played the best that they had
all year," Remington said. “Our success against
Beloit just shows us how good we can be ifwe
continue to work like we have been. It gives us
a starting point for next year."

Baumgartner said he expects to see im-
proved line play on both ottcnse and defense
next year as the young players there continue
to develop.

"Our offensive line has a lot of studs,
like freshmen [Mike] Tricoli and [Andrew]
LaRue,” he said. "They both started and they
both protected Pfalzer really well, so we should
be ﬁne [on the offensive line] next year."

The defensive line returns three players
who played extensively as ﬁrstrycars in Curtis
McCoy, Kyle Lohaugh and Chris Chavez.

The biggest loss for the Pioneers will be
Pfalzer, who is all but a lock to receive a post-
season honor as a quarterback and also served
as an effective punter.

Bourngartner gives a vote of conﬁdence
to current right end Remington as the player

 

NICK HECKER

expected to step in for Pfalzer as next year's
quarterback,

Pfalzer is excited about the team’s future, in
large part because of the recruiting efforts of
ﬁrst-year coach Zach Fletcher '03.

"Coach Fletcher has been working really
hard to recruit a big class of freshmen," Pfalzer
said. “I think they should have a good season
[next year]."
