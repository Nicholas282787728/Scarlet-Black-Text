Back in 1952, South Cninpus dorms were
still womcus territory. while the men chumed
the North Things hnve changed Todily, we
might criticize Htttfields totally way otlensive
heteranormat‘rve 1ssumptlons but his roast ol
cross—campus cultural difference is still well-
t1lten. Eighth Ave. is 1 ynst ocean, in unhe1r-
1bly deep trcneh,1 sweltering desert thnt none
but the bravest dare to cross. Or, none but the
most in lust

Its hard to 51y “hy Hatﬁeld is so ﬂip-
pine cynical about North south relntionships
Mu-be he suffered through 1 railed roin1ncc or
his own. We runy nCYCl' know. Rnthcr, changes
in e1mpus culture le1ve us with 1 more Imporr
tint puzzle to solve. In retl1y’t Grinnell, is there
space for East Campus in a love triangle?

Suffers assaults on his ears

Now, I’m no music such, but I’ve always
taken refuge in Grlnnell's relative l lation from
the most llcll‘lous ofmuslcal tttrocities. Last yurtr,
the Forum Grill was often filled with whatever-
music students working there felt like playing.
However, times have changed. \Vith the JRC's
soundsystern, someone else chooses the music
for the whole building, while Grille workers and
patrons alike are helpless to resist. Recently, my
time it the Grille 111s been plagued by the likes
of Metallica, Eon jovi and (cringe) Stainrl, 1701
mm withdritwhl is hard enough without these
hncks clogging the airwaves of rho JRC. I dont
much care whether or- not ﬁrst-years ,ynmrrrer on
their cell phones in the dining hall, but I do feat
for the health and sanity of the innocent Grille
workers and customers who 1te be subjected to
such exercises in 111111 scatology.
