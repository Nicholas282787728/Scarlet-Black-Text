The exhibition curared by Natalie Lat-
son ‘07» tenniring images of rhe nude human
figure, solidiﬁes her departure from rhe nun-
nery and enrranee into rhe professional nrtisne
world.

Lilrson came to Grinnell in 2002 with the
intent of finishing college early, and later was
faced with two radically different choices in
lites-tyre: becoming a nun and joining a cone
vent. or continuing college

After a sixeweelt sray .i i convent, Liiison
decided a nun's life was not for her. She re,
turned to Grinnell and dedicated herself to
art,

The exhibition, entitled “Figure Drawings
from the Grinnell Col-
lege Art Colleenon," is on
View in the in the Print and
Drawing study Room in
the lower level of Burling
Library, It presents 10 ﬁg*
ure drawings ranging from
the 16th century’s School
ot Michelangelo Buonar
roti to more contemporary
artists like Paul Cadmus.

Larson curated the ex-
hibir as parr ofher summer
internship at the Faulconer
Gallery.

Larson said her internship with the re-
cently established curarorial program at the
Fauleoner was extremely ﬂexible, even (00

dencc in her ability as an artist and an invlgnr
raring sense of being surrounded by people
who were committed to art, slre felt that the
program lacked rhe necessary strucnii-e rhnt
would more aptly prepare her for a tenure as
a curator.

However. as Fiiilconer Gallery dii-ecroi-
Leslie Wright sartl,"1n order to work in a mus
scumyoii need experience working in a muse
um.” The inreinship at the Fauleonei Gallery
provides a ﬁrst opportunity for students like
Larson to work closely with art and prepare
themselves for future employment in the mile
scum ﬁeld.

Larson’s internship included everything
from packing and unpacking rhe euirenr
Frank Breiicr photography
exhibit to personally se-
lecring pieces for her own
exhibition.

Larson selected piec-
cs with unfinished and
sketclrlikc qualities.
“One perhaps notices a
freshnessadirectness,and
even a compelling force
that comes from marks
that have been made and
left undisturbed," she said
in a press release.

In addition to her Faulconer internship,
Larson received funding from Grinnell to
spend two weeks of her summer in a New
York Drawing Marathon, a summer program
with an intense focus on figure drawing.

She called ﬁgure drawing, which is the
primary focus of both her exhibition and her
work as a srudio arrist, a “lost art,” and said this
crucial and tundamenral aspecr ot arr seems to
be slowly disappearing.

Given her eclectic past. it is nor surprising
that Natalie’s future is full of choices. She is
applying to seven to 10 graduate schools.

She is also considering applying for a Fur

or joining fellow Grinnell graduates in an
artistic community after graduating this De-
