With 22 new players entering camp.
the men's soccer players have to learn a
lot of new names this filll, but there is
a familiar name in goal. Sam Lancaster
’08 will be minding the net again and
hoping to improve last year’s 5,9.2 res
coid.

“Last year I starred strong, then
slumped during the middle of the sea-
son but finished the your playing the
best soccer or my life," the St. Paul,

.Minn., native said. “Despite the loss,
my best game last year was against
Lake Forest. "

Lancaster recorded 16 saves in that
game. For the season, he stopped 104
shots with a goalsragainstraverage of
173. He also had two shutouts,

you need to be able to look back and be ’

"With Sui-n in the net.we are."

laworski said Lancaster’s Contribur
tions to the team stretch beyond the
field, however. “Sam has done more
for this program than anyone else,” he
said. “He is well respected by the team,

and the college and has incredible work
ethic on and offthc field. He is a com-

Tournaments

BY ALEX WOODLE

Number one women's tennis player Shweta
Khajuria '07 gained a new perspective on team-
work after recently being named co-captain
alongside Margaret Block '08 heading into the
2006 season,

The Economics major new has to concens
irate on setting a good example for the young
er players. She also has to balance her own
Competitiveness with an environment that is
perhaps more laid back

“Grinnell culture is different,” said Khajur
ria. “[lt] is more about having fun, and it isn’t
all about being number one."

Khajuria began playing tennis at s‘ot yeais
old. She attended a tennis academy and starred
private lessons, where her instructors quickly
realized her potential.

The left-handed Khajuria learned to play
rightehnnded then because, she said, everyone
else was playing that way She still plays right-
llnnded, but her leftrhandcd tendency makes
her backhand devastating,

Khajuria came to Grinnell College after

deciding not to try her hand as a professional
tennis player, in part so she could play doubles
here with her sister, Sid Khajuria'OS. She said
the two kept each other motivated.

“It was really fun, but stressful. You can
shout at her unlike with fiiends," she said.

Coach Barb Waite belicvcs Khajuria is up
to the challenge of leading the tennis team as
a player and as a person. The coach said her
captain has a“uniquc and wonderful combina-
tion ofintensity as a competitor but [a] totally
congenial attitude."

The Cercaptain will team up with Rachel
Engh ‘08 for doubles play this season, with
Engh playing forward and Khajuria playing
back. Khajuria believes the tennis team has
good depth and can win some tournaments
if it gets good performances from the whole
team.

The tennis team kicks off the season at
Central college on Wednesday. then travels
to Iowa City on Thuisday to take on St, Arne
brosc.

Runner Spencer in shape for injury-free season

By MARCIE SCRIBNER

A treadmill in Beijing and an iPod ﬁill ofChinese pop mUr
sic are not your average cross country runner‘s training equip
ment. Then again, Sarah Spencer ’08 is not your average cross
country runner.

Spencer, a Chinese major, spent the summer in an eightr
credit intensive language program where participants could
speak only Chinese, she said. Though she prefers to run out
doors, she took to the treadmill four to five days a week to break
up her rigorous studying, relying on the foreign music to keep
her sane and well-versed in the vernacular.

“I have pretty serious exercise-induced asthma so running

in the smog in Beijing was not an option," Spencer said, who
found an alternate means to physically prepare for the season,
“You can‘t imagine how boring it is to run on a treadmillAs far
as my il>od goes, 1 really got my money's worth."

She hopes the hours logged indoors will help her finish
strong during the Midwest Conference season; last season, a
stress fracture ended her scason early. But she is coniident that
her training will enable her to return to the form that saw her
post a winning 18:40 5k time at the 2004 Loras Invitational
two seasons ago.

"I feel like I’m in really good shape now," Spencer said. “I
made it through the outdoor track season uninjured by coin-

peting in one race a week and cross-training in the pool and
the weight room."

Aside from the two weeks she rests between the cross coun-
try and outdoor track seasons each year, the Sioux Falls, S.D.,
athlete finds that she is most balanced when she stays busy ath-
letically and socially

“During the time. that I’m not practicingl know whatl
need to focus on. Between 4:30 and 7:00, I get that time to
socialize and relax with my teammates, I’m really going to take
advantage of my remaining two years with them because who
knows ifI will have the opportunity to run with a team again,"
said Spencer.
