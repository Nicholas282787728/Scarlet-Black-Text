Since Monday morning, our campus has been
one person short, but we have been left with a
hole that is much larger than just one pcrson. We
are all anxious, and we must deal both with Paul’s
disappearance and our reactions to it. The Sail? is
charged with documenting campus events, but at
this moment, we are more thanjournaljsts covering
events—we art: s nod and worried students grapv
pling with uncertainty. We are all searching for the
rightwords

Some of those who know Paul and some of those
who do not have shown their support and concern
by aiding the search for him, but this highly visible
effort is not the only way to help. It is okay to feel
uncomfortable with seardaing for Paul and there are
other things that need to be done on cam us

Already"; many students have opened t cir doors,
minds and hearts to help support the student body
We are encouraged by the immediate compassion

that people have shown and we hope-that this com»
passionand events like last night’s open forum are
only the first stage of campustwide discussion, retlec»
tion and coming together:

our collective conscience has been powerfully
jarred. It is difficult to articulate and address exactly
how we feel. It seems as though many ofus are wait-
ing for some kind ofconclusien before examining our
feelings, but we are all experiencing cmotions right
now that should not be ignored. Discussing the cf
fects of Paul’s disappearance is simply putﬁ dif-
ficult necessity, and it is something that we and the
college administration must do now.

For many of us, sitring in class feels utterly irrelv
evairt knowing that a classmate and friend of ours is
missinv We are worried for Paul and his family and
are hoping for the best IIowcvei'. continuing on with
our daily lives as best wt: can and cheeki ng in on each
other are the most immediate actions we can and

should take. Trying to know how we feel is scary,
but engaging the emotions and thoughts swirling
through our minds is the healthiest thing we can
do riulit now.

lfyou are feeling uneasy, please talk to someone.
It might be a friend, a profcssor, an SA, an RLC or
someone at the mental health center or chaplain’s
office,but, whoevei you talk to, the important part
is dealing with what has happened.

A member of our community is missing, and on
a campus as small as Grinuell’s, we are all affected
by his disappearance. We care about each other and
that makes us all involved in some way. We should
not stop worrying about Paulwquite the opposite,
it is impossible not to—btit we should also worry
about ourselves and each other.

Ask your friends how they art: doing. Then, ask
again. '

Take care of yourself, Grinnclli

Defining the world in black and white

Bad news for the endangered Republican incumbent: ovcr twosthirds of
Americans are displeased with current leadership ofthis country With the eleo
trons only one month away, the kingpin himself, President Bush, is desperately
trying to encourage support for his party’s unpopular foreign policy

This past Scpt. 11, a day supposedly ofrnoumrng and not of politicking, Bush
addressed the nation, asserting that in the “struggle between tyranny and freedom"
Americans must defeat an “enemy determined to bring death and suffering into
our homes.” Once again, the White House is relying upon a strategy that politis
cizcs September. 11 and exploits Americans’ fears offuturc terror attacks.

Although the administration's 2006 election strategy is nearly identical to those
employed in 2002 and 2004, the terminology used to
define America's “enemy" recently changed dramati-
cally. Whereas “evlldoers,” “terrorists" and “radical?
who-use-terror-to»ki].l~innocentrpeople" were popular
in the past, last month the president adopted the new
est rurnrofsphrnsc, calling America’s radical enemies
“Islamic fascists."

Aside from the fact that this new language is ter-
ribly offensive to Muslims, the prestdcnr's change in terminology is intentional.
“Islamic fascists” is clearly intended to evoke memories ofAmeriea's battle against
fascist regimes during World War 11.

In the 1930s and 1940s, our nation faced a grave threat from a unified and
omnrous cncniy: Nazi Germany. Later, the Cold War struck fear into the hearts
ofAmtticans. Past presidents, anticipating thc Bush administration’s strategy, cit-
ploited Americans fears offoreign threats. But the end ofthc cold War not only
deprived American presidents ofa menacing and monolithic enemy, it weakened
their ability to rally the American people for the next great patriotic struggle,

The terror attacks of September 2001 gave officials the foe they required: Al
Qieda. But even after the horrific attacks in September, at the time, Al Qaeda
was still relatively unknown, at small and disorganized hand of terrorists—hardly
a fearsome colossus capable of filling the void left by the “Evil Empire."Tlic war
in Afghanistan was understandably supported by the American people. As a re-
taliatory campaign bent on capturing those who murdered Americans in New
York and Washington D.C., creating an enemy of soviet—like proportions was
unnecessary.

But before President Bush could generate support for his less apparent war in
Iraq, Al Queda needed to be recast as part ofa larger, more menacing adversary
capable of spurring the American people into a comprehensive war against all
terrorism. 1t gradually became clear that Americans were no longer fighting small
bands of terrorists, but rather, the entire movement ofIslamic fundamentalism.

Not surprisingly, since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has continued to
lump various and differing Islamic terrorist groups and totalitarian regimes into
a new monolithic enemy, in 2006, a time when American patience for the war in

On the Verge

Iraq IS running thin,poitraying the enemy as even greater than that in Iraq is more
essential than before.

The President often speaks of America’s numerous assorted adversaries (Al
Qacda,Saddilm Hussein,I—Iezhollah, Hamas,Itau,ctc.) as all members ofa“\vorld-
wide network"thiit adheres to a common radical ideology. As Forced Zakarid notes
in the Sept. 18 issue of Newmre/t, like the term “Islamic fa cists," this rhetoric has
the benefit of“making the adversary seem largei and more sinister" than it actually
is, “thereby drumming up domestic support for the administration's policies."

Although these various “en mics"undeniahly have similar motives and anti-
American aims. the Bush admi istration commits a grave error by lumping to-
gether various groups ofIslamists and purporting rhar
they belong to the historical mass movement of fins
cism. As zakaria explanations in doing so, the White
House fails to recognize a critical mistake of the Cold
War.

In the 1950s and 1950s, American policymakers
unnecessarily grouped all communists together, creat—
ing a massive monolithic opponent. While beneficial
for political purposes, at the same time, American policy failed to acknowledge the
differei'accs between various communist regimes, differences that could have been
exploited.

Blind American administrations failed to play quariclling communist gow
crnments against each other. They unnecessarily forced a fractured communist
movement (spread across different states and cultures) to band together against an
American government that only saw in terms ofblaek and white. As a result, many
communist regimes reluctantly accepted Sovret patronage

Today, the president commits a similar strategic blunder. By grouping various
Islamic fundamentalists together, he foolishly ignores differences between groups
coming from different social and political environments. I-Ie forgets that adversars
ics are more easily conquered when divided and tracturcd, rather than united.

President Bush stresses that the War on Terror is “the calling of our genera-
tion,“thc decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century" and “the struggle for
civilization." Because of his rhetoric of Good and Evil, Bush forfeits any hope of
dealing with these groups separately lt sccms as though the president’s hard work
has finally made his predictions come micThe rcleasc ofthe previously classified
National intelligence Estimate on sept. 27, describes how the war in Iraq has cara-
ly1ed the creation ofa “global jihadist movement” composed of fonnerly diverse
and autonomous “anti-American groups."

Bush’s recklessness places Americans in increasing dangerThc world is gradu—
ally dividing inro two camps, and the next great patriotic struggle is looming. The
president's rhetoric may make a good campaign spccch,but it makes for worthless
foreign policy. With the present situation looking bleak, perhaps it's time to elect
leaders who respect the lessons of the past and endeavor to save the future.
