Gordon, cont. from p. I

no one hid any warning about Gordon's departure.

Sarah Smith '07. a Theatre major. was surprised. "It was a
shock [because] I found out a week before I came here."

Gordon spent last semester on sabbatical helping With the
rebuilding of New Orleans.Tbc semester before had been tu-
multtious for Gordon. She had been the chair of the Theatre
dspnttnrrnr off rind on for thc pievious five yours, but was to
moved from thin position uttcr Conﬂicts within the dcpnrttnont
nnd it recommendation from outside rcviowors. Many students
feared thnt she would ht firtd from her teaching position as
well

In light of these events, many students could understand
why Gordon had leftt “I wasn't shocked,” said Theatre major
Saul St. John '07, “You can’t really expect someone to stick
aiound at a school where they treat professors like that."

Thsntrc major Carolyn V05: '07 agreed. “She was in a tonso
situation," Voss said. “It was hard for her to deal with all the
burcnucrncy and red tape. At some point it bccomcs not worth
fighting for.“

Erik Sanning, Theatre, wasn’t sure how much the contro-
versy had affected Gordons decisiori.‘ “There have been some
growing pains and some personal conﬂicts, but i dont know
how much that factored into her departure," he said.

Smith said she thinks Gordon was simply losing interest
in theatre. She was “starting to realize theatre wasn’t what she
wanted to be doing with her life," Smith said.

Though students and faculty alike expressed regiet for
Gordon’s departure, many nlso said that it wrs n good move for
her saluting said (liar Gordon's position, which rcquircd both
tsnchrng unti work on production design, was a highsstrcss job
from which both hei predecessors had resigned.

Gordon. whose spccinlty was in stage and sot dosign, ro-
eently founded Kiwi Construction and Design Services in
Columbus Mo. She plrns to use her Companil to rebuild hon-res
in New Orleans where she will wotk with Griiitiell students
and Alumni.

She has also begun writing about hcr experiences in acts
dsrnrn rtnd thtttro rtnd her It’l‘mon upbringing Gordon has
a positive outlook on her future. “At 50,1am changing my man
jot," Gordon wrotc in an email, “Like all otyon, I too get to
graduate,"

Rabbi hired after yearlong search

BY ALISSA FLECK

The icvctching can stop. Grinnell ﬁnally has a rabbi.

After eight years on the iob, Rabbi Deborah Brin left her
position ofassoeiute chaplain rn May of 2005 President Russ
sell K. Osgood decided to rophcc tho associate chnpluin posis
(ion with it balfrtime rabbi position-rho college was unablé to
turd ﬂ wrlling and tcccprnblc replacement until this tiltwhcn it
hired Rabbi Daveen Litwin.

Chaplain Deanna Shorb said she worried the restricted
job description of hillf’l’lmti Jbi would make it difﬁcult for
— the college to per-7
surdo n qualiﬁed rabbi
to acccpt the position.
While Biin was also a
l‘iillf’fllnc rabbi, she had
other dutiss, including
hclprug studcnt groups.

“The president thought that it made the most sense to but
a half-time rabbi,"Shorb said.“Our peer institutions don't have
associate chupluins, so he decided thnt the roligious life intern
could help with associate chaplain duties and the rabbi could
inst do the other half of the position.”

Last year, members tifrhe Jewish strident group Chalutzini
lcd weekly worship and meetings Ribbirricnl studcnt Daria ja-
cobs was brought in to lead services during the Jewish High
Holidays. Grinneil students led their owrr Passover services.

Becca Weiner 08 wasn't heavily involved in Chaluzrim last
year, but noticed the absence You could tell there was rm rab-
bi,” she There wasnt u lot of spiritual leadership within
the organization.

Rabbi Litwin was hired after what Shorb describes as a dif-
ficult y‘eai ofscarching The college attracted .r lot ot’npplicnnrs,
but not many that it considered qualified for the job

“It s difﬁcult because there's not a lot of community for the
rabbi, Shorb said Shts helping crcrto community but where
does she go to have her religious needs met? To be icwrsh cul-
turally in this area is not supsr onsy. We drrln't want someone to

come and their leave because it wasn't what they expected"

Tho final iob posting troussttd a hnlttinrc rabbi who coulti
“work based on the needs of the college" and also the “experi-
cute and gifts ofthe candidate."

Litwin previously served as in cxecutivt: directoi oi'tho Jor ,,
ish group Hillcl .rt Kansas University, and also served in a full
congrsgntion shotb said these two experiences made Litwin
secm a natural fit for Grinnell’s needs.

“Though her gifts wtrc in tongrcg ional group, she hid an
interest in working with this age grail I true desire to come to
Grinnell,"said Slinrb, “We were looking for someone who had
experience in both rrcns, but a mic desire to come to Grrnrroll

\Veuier agreed. “Dal/ecu offers a lot of spiritual and reli-
gious guidnncc {or the stuticnts,"sho shot.

In addition to service as the college’s lllllf'tin'ic rabbi, Litr
win provides counseling services.

“Vi/hi1: l’m obvioti '1 available to meet with students who
are interested in talking
