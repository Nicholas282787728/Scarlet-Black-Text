You call the group anti-war and pro—sol»
diet. What does that mean?

My signiﬁcant other is in the military, the
army reserve from Iowa. Through him in
met a lot of people who have been over or
will be over in ltaq. A lot ofsoldiets are not
supporters of Bush, not supporters of the war
in Iraq A majority ofsoldiers are between
the ages of 18 and 29.This is a way for sole
diets to get insight into the students’ lives
and vice versa.

What kind of responses have you gotten?

1 had some or my posters tipped down and I
received two hate emails. It was really hard to
keep going ...There are a lot of misconcep-
tions. My boyfriend came for spring Waltz.
He came right from drill and was still wear-
ing his uniform, his camo. People stared and
they weren’t good states and that’s one of my
reasons for doing this,

What are your boyfriend’s political views?
He's very, Very liberal. We watch che Daily
Show together and that’s not exactly a com
servative talk show. He's going to Iraq in
January as a communications specialist. He's
having to cut his education short. He [joined
because] he had no way to pay for school.
He's terriﬁed and I’m so scared for him.

Grinnell Mayor Gordon Canﬁeld’s mail—
box is full. “I guess 1 should start getting no or
the old ones, huh?” he said.

Canﬁeld’s been getting mail ever since he
became mayor or Grinnell in 1999. origi-
nally from Minneapolis, Canﬁeld has lived
in Grinnell since 1952 and replaced the last
mayor rrpon his death.

Cinneld is proud of the projects coming
to a revitalized Grinnell, such as a larger and
updated library, safety department and family
aquatic center. These developments will be
funded both by the passage of an additional
one-cent sales tax but also significantly by pri-
vate contributions,

He is proud of rhe
"progressive attitude of

who he believes under

stand the cost ofimporr

tant facilities and services
that will ultimately bent

eﬁt the town as a whole.
“I don‘t know that every other town can say
that," he said.

Most students are familiar with the most
recent public venture— the new jewel Box
brick designs laid on the intersections ofdown-
town Grinnell, Canﬁeld hopes the roadwork
will make it "more pleasant" to be downtown.

”We encourage parlltlparion in the poll
the people of Grinnell " (ﬂlﬂf0(€SS.. You are expected to vale and
part/(ware, jUSlnol in a purl/San way”

Mayor Gordon Canﬁeld

Acccording ro him, the city council wanted to
show support for downtown retail establishe
merits and make the business area more user
friendly.

The new pedestrian
crosswalks, as wella
additional hanging TOW”
ﬂower baskets from
tllc light poles which
will arrive next spring,
are meant to draw more visitors,

He said the Strand Theatre has added
culture and entertainment, calling it the best
thing to ever happen to Grinnell’s downtown
area. “You sometimes have to hunt for a park
ing spot, which never
happened before," he
said.

Canﬁeld said his
greatest challenge is

having to be politi-
cally conservative and
liberal at the same
time since, as he put it,
“Grinnell residents [and city council members]
go both ways."

He found it surprising that the Grinnell
College Campus Democrats endorsed city
council candidate Oliva Wright in last year's
election as all of Grinnell"s civic positions are
nonrpartlsﬂn.

”Grinne/ / students are the /l'feb/00d of this

Mayor Gordon Canﬁeld

“We encourage participation in the politi-
cal process," said Canﬁeld. “You are expected
ro vote and participate, just not in a partisan
way."

“Grinnell students
are the lifeblood of this

town," he said, emphar
sizing education as one
of the rounding ptinr
ciples of the city.

“Private businesses will come and go,
but the college will always be here," he said.
When asked about his thoughts on the new
Super WalrMal't on Highway 14o, Canﬁeld
responded in a selfedescribed tongueeinecheek
way; “I encourage all students to spend all of
their money downtown."

Canﬁeld urged students to join their felt
low Grinnell residents in attending eity coune
cil meetings, which occur on the ﬁrst and third
Monday of every month, at 7:00 pm. in the
Community Center Budding at 927 4th AV’
enue.

Cozy mismatched chairs,
a spacious interior and scents
of freshly baked pastries and
pies greet my senses as 1 step
into the Comeback Cafe’
Coffeehouse and Battery on
the corner of Commercial
and Main.

It's just past two o’clock,
and the cafe is calm and quiet.
Two women sit in the corner
charting over latres while a
table or locals enjoys'a same
pling of pies and scones, The
cafe’ may be nearly empty, but
it won’t be long until the spur
cious wooden tables are ﬁlled
with hungry customers.

“There’s nowhere to sit at
lunch, were always packed,"
said owner Lisa Stewart.
“[Our main customers] are
people who work in the
downtown area, mostly the
college and the bank. We get
lots ofwalk-in trafﬁc.”

Although few Grinnell
students atronize the Come-
back C e, Stewarr is consid-
cring expanding her hours
and installing wireless inter-
net to make the space more
inviting to students.

The students who have al-
ready discovered the cate are
quick to recommend it.

“They have good smooths
ies," said Liz Ward '07. "I ran
member the service was slow,
bur friendly,"

The café, which opened
last August, has become a fat
vorite for locals with its wide
selection of wraps, sandwich
es, gourmet salads, drinks and
desserts.

they can browse an adjoining
