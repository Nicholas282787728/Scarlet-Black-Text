to apartments

Construction of apartment-style rooms in what used to be Cowles Dining Hall is
on schedule but students living above the site are in for another rough semester

lav DAVID MONTGOMERY

Emily Roberts 10 arrived at Cowles Hall in August, excited to
see her new home. Instead she saw a construction site.

“They didn’t tell me beforehand,” Roberts said. “I cried when I
saw my dorm tor the ﬁrst time."

The college startcd converting the former Cowlcs Dining Hall
into apartment-style rooms right after school ended in May. While

' many students are eagerly looking torward to the new living option,
that is no consolation to the students who live upstairs trom the
construction site. .

Justin Abramson ’08 lives in Cowles in what he said was im»
mediately above the noisiest construction."I’ve learned to deal with
the noise, he said. The loss of heat we experienced right before
fall break and then a couple weeks after fall break was absolutely
intolerable."

The administration had
hoped this would not be a
problem. Vice President
for Student Services Torn
crady said the plan was
to finish the noisiest con,
struction before students
returned, brrt this did not
occur. “We didn’t expect to
have that level of problems, to be honest,” Crady said. “We're trying
to respect where students are."

Roberts said that despite her complaints, the college has been
somewhat responsive to student concerns. “They’ve been pretty
good about getting things rived," Roberts said. ”I don‘t know if [the
problems] are really their tault."

Crady said the administration is looking to compensate stir-
dents in Cowles for the inconvenieucc caused by thc construction.
Students have already had 550 transferred onto their P-Cards. For
Abrnmson, this was a “nice gesture, but compared with what we had
to go throrrgh, it’s not enough, frankly."

”We didn’t expect to have lhat
level afpmb/ems, to be honest.”

Tom Crady, vice president for
StudentServices

students in Cowlcs are not optimistic about the problems im-
proving, “Ifanything, they might get worse," Roberts said. “It's not
{an to have students living in that building at all, some form of
compensation for students, move us out orthcre, do something."

Apartment draw to be based on seniority
crady said construction is currently on schedule to bc open by
thc beginning ofncxt school year. When finished, Cowles will fea-
ture a number ofnew ncrrmal rooms, and six regular apartment com,
plexes.There is also a separate apartment for two SAs.

Each complex will ten-
rure a common room, a
kitchen, a bathroom and
room for ﬁve or six students.
The apartments are on two
levels with bedrooms on the
second ﬂoor over a balcony.

There will also be handicap-accessible rooms in the complex, but
the exact location ofthosc rooms has not yet been decided.

Abramson, an SGA Senator who is on the Housing Commit
tee, said that the Cowles apartments will be given out using the
carop system rather than the group draw system. This means that
preference will be entirely based on class seniority and not random
room draw numbersThe corop system will also be changed to allow
groups to pick three preferred choices rather than one.

What is unclear is how popular the new rooms will be. While
they offer the ability to live onrcampus but off-board, they also look
one amenity that many uppctclassmcn look for: singles.

A lot of people thought that they’d be an alternative for off
campus housing for seniors." Abrarnsou said. “The problem with
that rs that all but six ofrhe bedrooms are doubles.. .These rooms,
or some otthem might actually go to underclussmerr.

As a side effect of the new apartments next year, SGA' Ilnaniv
rnously passed an amendment giving the CND cluster an additional
Senator on Joint BoardThe student body wrll vote on the initiative
next semester.

”These rooms might «moi/y
go to undert/assmen.”

Vigil celebrated
library takover

- rsr'Rclxeccn PARK

Thc sccnc at Biltling Library lastWedncsday was
a little ditterent than it was 35 years ago. Instead of
copies of thc crrnrpus's “Black Manifesto," students
came with candles, in a vigil to honor the takeover
of 1971.

With demands including an improved Cultural
Center and the establishment of a Black Library,
African-American students barricaded themselves
in protcst inside Bur-ling on the morning of Nov. 29,
1971. After a conference with then-President Glenn
chgott, some or the goals, such as the afotorncnr
rioncd library, were met, while others, like the instale
lzirion of .\ black studcntrfrlculty review board, were
not as successful.

Concerned Black Students (CBS) Treasurer

vigil, said that even though the 1971 lakcovcr (lid

Open curriculum
not in danger

BYMERRICKMEVERS

Gr'innell‘s “open curriculum" has been a lauded
teaturo otthc school's academic program to. decades,
even attcr most other colleges with open curr-iculurns
rlbnndoncd the Concept in the early nineties, But later
ly, the removal of the phrase “open curriculum" t'rom
Grinnell’s promotional material has raised fears that
the college is considering distribution requirements.

Dean of Admission Jim Sumner said he would be
“shocked" ifsuch a proposal were ever madeThc ad-
ministration is not considering any such proposals.

New promotional materials instead use the phrase
“lndivldunlly advised curriculum," This change was
driven by a concern that Grinnell's curriculum was
not actually open.

Students face distribution requirements to study
ott—campus, double major and graduate Phi Beta
Kappa.

sumner said some promotional materials lauding
thc open curriculum were misleading. “We got some
feedback from faculty that said that ‘open eurriculum’
gave prospective students a bit of the wrong idea,"hc
said, By making changes to the school‘s publications,
he hopcd Grinnell’s yield rates would improve. “The
rationale is to try to give a more accurate picture,"
Sumner said. “As our promotion gets more and more
accurate and more and more precise, our retention
goes up"

Even though distribution requirements are not be
ing considered, the college is discussing larger change
es to the curriculum. Paula Smith, Englis , said she
hoped the current system will remain in place, despite
the increased work it creates for advisers. She said that
discussions continue within the administration about
possible changes. .

SEPC chair and Student Curriculum Commits
tee member Tinsley Hunsdorter ’03 said that any
changes are as likely to make the curriculum more
open as more restricted some professors have voiced
concerns that curricular requirements such as those
of the OffrCampus studies program were imposed
without their consent. "The faculty, at the end of the
day, is supposed to havc control over these things,"
Hunsdotfcr said

lerrsdorrer thought that no changes would be
made for several years.
