 

Open Letter Regarding The Coca-Cola Company’s
Commitment to Water Stewardship

The Case for Action.

Freshwater has never been in greater demand for all the services it provides — from habitat to drinking
water to irrigation to commercial uses. Across the planet, the most precious, shared resource is
increasingly under stress.

The Coca—Cola Company and its worldwide bottling partners have a genuine commitment to adequate
and equitable access to water. Water is vital to us all, and there is much work to be done to enable safe
drinking water access and protect the watersheds that sustain life.

Our Commitment.

We are committed to help protect and preserve water resources _ and that commitment begins at
home, in our operations. In 2004, we improved our water efﬁciency by 6% across our global bottling
plants. Everyday, we continue to work hard to reduce the amount of water we use, and 2005 results will
be reported in detail in our forthcoming annual environmental report.

Making a Start.

With the guidance of environmental and public health leaders, we have begun to see where and
how we can help make a difference to this global challenge at a local level. By forging long-term
partnerships with the United Nations Foundation, the United States Agency” for International
Development (USAID), and others, we are actively working with communities and addressing our
responsibilities to do our part. ‘

0 In India, where we have faced allegations about groundwater depletion, we have redoubled our
efforts on water sustainability through investment in “rainwater harvesting" in many of our plants.
Today, we return a substantial portion of the water we use to local aquifers. We’ve also partnered
with local Communities to set up rainwater harvesting projects that beneﬁt the people who live
there, including a recent initiative in Lucknow.

In Mali, in partnership with USAID, we are starting to address community water needs by installing
well hand pumps at several locations throughout the country and by working with community groups
and micro—entrepreneurs to improve water access in Bamako.

In Kenya, as with ‘most of the African continent, many schools lack access to safe water and adequate
sanitation. The greatest burden is born by girls who are often forced to drop out of school. With the
Millennium Water Alliance and CARE, we are introducing Safe Water Systems in primary schools
in Nyanza province.

For The Coca-Cola Company, this is just the beginning.
