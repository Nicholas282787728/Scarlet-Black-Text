The ﬁfth annual Cereal Bowl was
the ﬁrst triumph of the Grinnell swim
team over the Grinnell track and cross
country team ‘In four years.

This year, the Cowles staff also aid-
ed rhe teams in organizing the evenr,
putting out large plastic tubs of cereal
and preparing staff to reﬁll bowls.

Each team sits in Cowles, ready to
eat as many bowls olece Krispies (or

the generic equivalent) as they can in '

20 minutes.

Participants are free to use either
water or milk to wash down the puffed
rice.

Veterans pass down tricks of the
trade from yearsrosyear.

“You can’t drink too much milk,
It’ll make you sick,“said swimmer Sean
Warlick’08,who are 30 bowls, the third
most ofanyone competing.

The Cereal
Bowl

The event originally
Started ﬁve years ago
as a competition be-
tween the men's track
and cross-country
teams and the men's
swimming anti diving
team to determine
which group of an
lem was superior.

Stayer was not only competitor who
vomited during the competition.

The swim team’s strategy involved
eating until the last possible moment,
at which point the athletes would run
outside to throw up. Out of about 40
participants, 12 vomited outside of the
cafeteria.

This strategy seemed to work very
well for the swim team, which are a
team total of 146 bowls, crushing the
cross-country and track team’s 9S bowls
and men's soeeer's meager 89 bowls,

Swimmer Bud Baumgattner ’07 ate
the most of any competitor, finishing
33 bowls.

However, the cross-country and'
track team still holds the overall record
for the most bowls of cereal eaten by a
single athlete. The current record is a

runner Dave Crist '06,

Although Crist’s record was left in—
tact, it did not provide very much cons
solation for a few members ofthe track
team, who took the loss very hard.

“It‘s pretty heartbreaking," said run-
ner Nick Fogg '06. “I can't believe we
lost to the water babies."
