Grinnell is a finalist for an indoor rainforest project with educational

and economic benefits,

By DAVID MONTGOMERV

A dozen thirdsgrilders, shepherded
by a watchful teacher, meander through
a tropical rainforest, the air filled with
birdcalls. Sunlight ﬁlters down from
above. illuminating rare ferns, Exotic
varieties of frogs and reptiles perch on
trees, while in a nearby body of water
multi-colored Amazon
River fish dart by.

But these children
aren’t on an expensive
field trip to Brazil. 1f
local leaders have their
way, within five years
they could be near the
intersection of Interstate
so and Highway 146,
contained within a trans-
lucent,high-tech SO-sto-
ry high dome,

That's the goal of
the Environmental
Project, a non-proﬁt or-
ganization based out of
Des Moines The finished project will
include the indoor rainforest and an
aquarium containing up to one million
gallons of water, with the entire com-
plex integrated with a restored tallgrass
prairie. Grinnell is one of four Iowa
communities that have been selected as
finalists to host the Project, along with
Pella/Red- Rock, Riverside and TifﬁrL

The total cost estimate is around
$160 million dollars, with 350 million
coming from a controversial federal

(V’s;

,

grant earmarked by Senator Charles
Grassloy (R-IA). The host community
is expected to provide s25 million.with
the iest of the money coming from
contributions by businesses and other
nonprofit foundations.

The Environmental Project's eXCCt

utive director David Oman said
that the focus is entirely on education,
“The building is all about the environs
merit, and teaching people about mul—
tiple ecosystems," Oman said. “[That
includes] the rainforest, but not ex-
clusively that one. It's aimed at teach
ing visitors about the environment,
threats to the environment and fragile
ecosystems." The rainforest will con-
tain many different types of ﬂora and
fauna but not large mammals.

but some criticize funding as pork~barrel excess

Potential ﬁnancial beneﬁts for the
host community are huge. An “0mm,
ic study commissioned by the Project
estimated that the facility would at-
tract over one million visitors every
year, close to the numbers brought in
by the Eden Project, a similar complex

in Cornwall, UK, since
it opened in 2001. The
study plcdicted an Addi’
tional $130 to $140 mil-
lion per year for the host
community.
“There’s 35,000 cars
per day that drive past
Grinnell," said Grinnell
Trustee Todd Linden,
who has been closely int
volved in Gtinnell's at-
tempt to get the Project.
“I think there are obvious
[benefits] in terms of
economic impact. Once
[visitors] are offthe 1n-
terstate [to visit the Proj»
ect], they’re coming into Grinnell, stays
ing in motels, eating in restaurants and
shopping in our historic downtown."

Bill Mcnner, executive director of
Poweshiek Iowa Development (Pow
1.30), agreed, citing other beneﬁts. “It
would bring a huge number of wells
paying jobs,"Mcnner said. “They antic-
ipate this having 150 employees. Many
of them would be technical in nature"

Design for ITS usage of the Forum has
focus on usability, but also some critics

5v SARAH PIERCE

Recent debate over the future of the Forum has uncovered a
strong desire to make sure that it remains a peoplcrfocused space
even aftei ITS takes it over next yeul.

Since the change was announced on March 6, several groups on
campus including ITS, the Student Academic computing Com-
mittee (SACC). the Instructional Support committee and the Stur
dent Government Association have been organizing the switch.

The groups differ in how they would see the Forum next year
and are working to find a compromise. “We want [the Forum] to
have a welcoming atmosphere," said ITS Director Bill Francis.

Megan Goenng'os has represented both SGA, SACC and the
Technology Consultants at meetings With the architects. “There
is .i general consensus that community is absolutely critical [0 the
present and the future oi the forum," Gocring said. “People really
want to make sure that this space that they have found so special for
studying, for hanging out with tiiends and for meeting with profes—
sets is maintained with at
least some resemblance of
how it is today."

In order to obtain a bet—
ter idea of student interests,
SACC ran a contest invite
ing students to design their
own layout for the Grill and
Coffeehouse. The committee selected the design of Rachel Walberg
’09 as the winneri

walberg said she wanted to design a place where all Grinnell
students would feel comfortable. “There were signs up around came
pus saying ‘Do you want to see the Forum without people in it?w
Walberg said. “It was antitcomputer Forum. And I’m pro-computer
Forum. So 1 was trying to make something that people would like
to be in."

Francis said that ITS will respect the Forum. ”At some point
maybe it will be used for something else, so we aren’t making very
many modiﬁcations to the actual walls on the more public ﬂoor,"
Francis said.

As the plans are now, the SGA ofﬁces will become storage area.
The current Student Affairs offices will be maintained for use by
the ITS ndmiuisrration. North Lounge will be used for different
ITS teams. The current Forum Express (FX) will become a trains
mg workshop room. The Grill will become a “Creative Computing
Lab," though what this means is not yet settled,

Both the Health Center and the South Lounge will remain as
they are now.

”We want [the Forum] to have
a we/toming atmosphere”
