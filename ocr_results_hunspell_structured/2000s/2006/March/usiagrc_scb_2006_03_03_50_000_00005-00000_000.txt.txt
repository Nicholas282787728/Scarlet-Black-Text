Seedy dealings at CERA

5v KATIE MCMULLEN

Like many collectors, Lee Running, Art, loves
to show off her treasures. Rather .than display’het
growmg collection of seeds in the traditional fashion,
Running creates works ofartt

Placing the seeds in a slide projector, Running
traces the projected images onto transparent acetate
with black ink and then exposes the tracing to light-
sensitive emulsion, creating a stencil. She uses paint
made from burned prairie grasses, charcoal and wallr
paper glue.

For today's “Shadows, Echoes, and Ghosts," an
interdisciplinary panel addressing the social, spiritual,
historical and artistic facets of seeds, Running has
transformed the Conrad Environmental Reasearch
Area (CERA) building into a shrine to the seed. Her
art cnvclops the buildings, walls, floors, windows and
furniture, As part ofthc panel, she will discuss her artr
work, and others will represent the acids ofsociology,
biology, anthropology and religion.

“The idea of being able to make a shadow from
the burniyou know, make that really physical con-
nection materially between what's going up on the
walls and the regenerative power of fire in that lands
scape—was pretty exciting to me," said Running.

Running has been collecting seeds and creating
seedcbased art since last semester. The organic, con,
nective nature of Riinning’s work caught the attention
of Luis Fernandez, Sociology The two began discuss»
ing the various strata of seeds in society, eventually
forming the panel.

“We realized there was this common thread in
both our research and our work that we hadn’t talked
about before, but that these seeds were bringing us
together about this," said Running. "The idea of the
panel emerged organically from us really physically
looking at seeds in this space."

Fernandez identiﬁes the seed as a "location of
struggle? He has been interested in genetically modi-
fied seeds and social movements related to the issue.

“l've been reading a lot about indigenous move
ments that have been gathering around the seed as a
symbol ofwhat is called the global commons: those
things that we as humans own collectively because we
produce collectively over thousands and thousands or
years," said Fernandez.

To encompass all aspects of seed discourse, Fer-
nandez and Running collaborated with a Pagan
priestess, Reverend Circe Moss.

“We’ve asked her to come because she has a con»
nection as a pagan, a particularly spiritual connection
to the seed' in certain ways so that the seed becomes a

' metaphor for all sorts of spirituality said Fernandez.

Also on the panel is Jonathon Andelson, Anthro-

pology. Andelson plans to share the story of the Hi-

datsa bean to demonstrate the historical connotations
of the seed.

“Historical awareness," said Andelson. “That’s
what I hope they get out it. A seed is a historical arti»
factt It carries a story ofa variable number otyears of
the history of that plant.That’s one of the best stories
there is.”

The panel participants expect an nonetraditional
mood and understanding

“its kind ofan experimental thing, said Fernanr
dez. “We re trying not to just produce another panel.
We're trying to produce something that‘s being expe
rienced differently. It is bound to look a little strange
because you’re crossing certain, even epistemological
understandings of how to know anything."

As for Running, the panel provides the perfect
venue for sharing her treasures,

“As tar as what 1 really hope people will see it is the
beauty of genetic diversity and the beauty of so many
ofthese seed shapes and how different, how radically
different they all are from each other,"she said.

“The high quality of the professors at Northwestern is a
huge strength! The professors are very straightforward
about the amount of work that is required, but I know
I will look back and realize that I learned from the best
of the best.”

John Bell ’08’s hands are always
covered in paint. When his paintings
are still wet, the colors dripping down
the front of the canvas as it hangs on
the wall, he takes a palette knife and
scrapes the thick layers of house paint
or acrylic into, well, whatever he feels
like,

“if you impose stuff on a can-
vas, it will inevitably go to hell,” Bell
said. The result is a collection or gi-
ant‘sizcd, paintesplatteted canvasses,
sometimes as tall as six feet.

Bell is an art major who grew
up in Rockford, 111., with two artist
parents. Since arriving at Grinnell,
he has begun branching out from
his traditional roots into an alterna—
tive painting style.While he has only
been seriously painting for two years,
Bell has developed an amniry for
oversize, impulsive paintings.

Bell finds it difﬁcult to put a
name to exactly what he does “The
problem with painting is that every»
thing has already been done," he said.
“This is about taking different styles
and twisting them in a new way.”Bcll
has not settled on a single type of ar—
tistic expression and continues to see
new artistic forms as performance
and adventures

Many of the works Bell has com-
pleted while at Grinnell arc rcminis»
cent of the ﬂung paint and cacopho-
nous colors of Jackson Pollock. Bell
shies away from calling himself an
abstract expressionist. “Abstract ex-
pressionist. I don‘t really like that be—
cause it puts a label on it," he said "It
means ‘self-ahsotbed painting. . .This
stuff is inherently considered preten-
tious, and I don’t want it to be,”

. Bell doubts his art will be widely
embraced outside ofBucksbaum.

“These are paintings that people
love to hate," Bell said, remarking
that he believes he made one of his
best paintings when he was four.
“When you're painting as a kid, you
don't have these preconceived nor

tions of good and bad the more
you practice this kind of art, you get
better at letting go of what you’re go—
ing for."

For Bell, painting is a perrorr
mince. “These types of paintings are
paintings about painting. It’s about
the physicality, it’s about the smell, it’s
about the scratching,” he said, as he
ran his ﬁngernails across the acrylic
sticking out from a paint-splattered
canvas. “praintings are good, you see
the action that went into it."

Bell believes that action cannot
be planned. “[My work is] not auto~
hiographical' in the sense that when
Im depressed, I come in here and
paint a black painting, he said “Its
more that I’m painting entirely on
instinctt"

His canvases dvmrfed the others
arranged on easels in the paint studio.
The canvases have gotten so big that
for some works, he no longer tacks
the canvas to wooden frame backs
ings, He just tapes the blank canvas
to the wall.

“Paintings like this work better
when they’re big," he said. It’s the
size of the gesture in relation to the
body."

He decides when his paintings are
finished based on instinct, too, though
admits that even when he decides a
piece is done, it’s never perfect.

“I see its failures still,’ he said,
gazing at a work he ﬁnished off that
morning with final splashes of bright
red paint. “I haven’t painted a paint-
ing I’m happy with yet.”

Bell’s new adventure in technique
is attempting to recreate Rosarch
inkblots, the famous psychological
testing tool, on canvas. He has fin-
ished only one so far, a dark sploch
on a muddy, earthrtoned background.
"This is a butterﬂy slash whatever
you want it to be,” he said. “In a lot
of abstract pieces that I like, i saw a
lot of similarity with the ambiguity,
and I thought, how cool would it be
to isolate that?”
