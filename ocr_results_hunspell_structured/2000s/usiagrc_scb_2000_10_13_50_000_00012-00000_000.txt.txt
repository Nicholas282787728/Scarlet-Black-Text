Water polo ‘dream’ team ends third in division

by Nicholas Johnson
Spon‘s Editor

The Grlnnell werer polo teem, the Wild Turkeys,
hes neeumulerod ouire rhe reeord during reeenr years.
III all the articles that have been published about them,
not once has the team not been referred to as
“drenmy"

The team’s record in the pool rivals its drenmincss
our of rhe pool. Although water polo is a club sporr,
has no ofﬁcial coach and organizes itself. the Turkeys
have compiled dwindoss percenrnge rhnr even rhe besr
varsity sporrs would be envious oh

This year proved no exception for the coed Tur»
keys. who ere comprised mosrly or members or rhe
swim team. The team )LISI Finished hosting the Colle-
giate Water Polo Association’s Heartland Division
Tournament last weekend, where it took third place
in the division. Two weeks earlier the team went une
defeated at e rournnmenr held or St. Mary's Univer»
siry in Winonn, Minn.

”We hed a reelly gredr reem rhis year," said Turkey
Mark Martins '03. ”We didn't do as well as we hoped,
bur we played a lor berrer then we ever had."

The team's disappointment eeme in its thirdsplnco
finish at the Heartland Tournament. While the Ti -
keys did ﬁnish in the top halfof the sevcneteam cli
sion, they lost the second»placc title they were defend-

ing from lnsr year and fell shorr oftheir goni ro ﬁnish
in rhe rop two

Finishing eirher ﬁrsr or second looked like s pos—
sibiliry for rhe rcnm early in last weekend's tourna-

Universiry in rhe opening round of the rournomenr
on sorurdey. The win set rhem up for e Stmlrﬁnnl

to keep up wirh 5r. Mary’s rhroiigh rhe end orreguln.
rion pinyin rhe match, bureould not pull our rhe win
in overrime and fell 91 l.

The loss to 3r. Mary's bumped Grinnell down to
play in rhc third-place match on Sunday, where rhey
pulled our a il.io win over Carleron.

Despite rhe team's disappointing finish, the Tur-
keys snid that rhe rournnmeni wns srill e sueeess.

“I rhink we hnd gross reem spirir and we had n lor
orrun." Lenh Blesisk '03, mid. “we would have liked
ro do a lirrle berrer, bur we had a lor orrun,"

Though rhe loss ro 5r. Mary’s was difficult (or rhe
renin, scvcrsIl plnycrs srill mnnnged ro look extra-
dreamyin the rourmmenr. Mntuzas rurned in his typi»

The team else singled our the homoepoul ndvnn.
rnge as one ofthe highlighrs ofthe rournsmcnr.

“The crowd wns grenr. espeeinlly or our second
game," hlnsiuksnid.

“I rhink [rhe roumemenr] was grenr for our team,
ro gor e home gem and homo supporr and ro ger
people here ro ger a chines to see water polo,” Anna
Carey '03, seid.

“So rhey con undersrsnd that we don't hnve
horses," Blesink sdded.

Besides rournemenr highlighes, rein-r members also
pointed re the many posirive aspects ofthe game that
helped rhem enioy rhe senson, which is now over ro

“The cool rhing ebonr water polo is that it's a
gnme," Blesink said. “You per in [rhe peel] end you
ger n workour, bur you don’t reeliee that you're get—
ring a workour "

For Carey, rhe emphasis on the reem made rho
water polo serson rim, “I've been swimming my whole
life, end it’s nice ro hnve a group sporr were you rely
on people," shcsaid. “And I like how ﬁerce ir is, too.”

Msruzns ssid he liked rhe thinklng needed to be a
good water polo plnyer. “It’s a very heads»up game~
you hnve ro be swore ofwhat's going on," he said. “I
like rhnr nspccr orir."
