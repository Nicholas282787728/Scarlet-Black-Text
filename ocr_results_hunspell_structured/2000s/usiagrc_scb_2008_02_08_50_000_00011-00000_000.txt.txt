Program links Grinnell to a Chinese university

BY SARAH ERVIN

On Jan. 30 Yi Pan, the Vice Presi—
dent of Nanjing Uiiiieisity an ived at the
Grinnell campus as part of a geiicial toui
of the Ameiiclin schools that ale involved
in exchange programs with Nanjing Uni-
versity. Grinnell has a two-decade-loiig
relationship with the Nanjing University,
a program now run by David Harrison,
Director of the Center for International
Studies.

Through the schools partnership,
there is an active exchange of faculty
members. and two Grinnell graduates
travel to Nanjing each year to teach at a
middle school in Nanjing. “Grinnell's mt
laiion with Nanjing University is a model
of how Grinnell relates to the world,"
said Harrison. “There is an honesty and
a reciprocity that has allowed for greater
understanding of the two cultures."

Harrison has been to Nanjing twice
himself, once on a trip with other faculty
members, and more Iecel‘ltly fol last Jan-
uary’s renewal of the partnership agree-
ment. The school, he said is, “very big and
lively. There's a lot going on, and we got
to know China in a very authentic way."

Professor Barbara Trish. Political Scit
ence. is one of the Grinnell faculty mem
bers who has lived and taught in Nanjing.
Trish made a brief Visit to the school in
2002, and in 2006, Trish traveled back to
Nanjing, this time with her sons in tow,
and spent the slimmer teaching a shoit
political science course.

“There’s a shock of being in this new
place that‘s completely diﬁ’erent," she
said. "out the support on both sides is
just great."Trish feels that the best aspect
orihe exchange program rs “the personal

connections that you can generate and
nurture.”

In addition to faculty interactions,
eight students from the city of Nanjing
currently attend Grinnell. Although
they are not direcdy afﬁliated with the
university, are school facilitated their ap-
pheations to Grinnell, During his trip to
Grinnell, Pan had lunch wltli several of
the Nanjing students, and he said that
they are “all very proud and happy to be
here at Grinnell."

Yuyang Fan ’11, one of the students
who attended tl lunch with Pan, said
that his international study has given
him the opportunity to attend a school
without core requirements and a chance
to experience life in smallttown America.
“A small town has a different kind of
fun compared with big eitres,” Fan said.
“[Nanjing] has more than six million
people.“

Besides meeting with students, Pan,
who traveled with Programs omcet Me»
Lissa Hu and Director of the Office of
Human Resources Zhang Junteng, also
met with faculty members who have been
involved in the exchange. He said that the
schools relationship is "very important to
the university and to the international or
ehange."

While Han ison said that he does not
foresee significant changes to the pros
g'mm, Pan hopes that in the future, the
schools’ Ielationship will include a se-
mester or year-long exchange of students
who could be involved in research and
teaching. “In China," he said, “We have
a saying that twenty years is a generation,
so the year 2008 is really a new start for
out cooperation,”
