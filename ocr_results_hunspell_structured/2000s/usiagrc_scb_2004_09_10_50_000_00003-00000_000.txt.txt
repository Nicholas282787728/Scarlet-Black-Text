A: I don't think it's always true. Alters
native histories are written in all sorts of
waysrrtor example, women's magazines
were a valuable source for me in trying to
historicize the immediate postwai period in
France, is that country lost its empire and
lurchcd into new Americanrstylc consump
tion habits. But after the political upheavals
of the 19605, many former militants tuined
to writing detective novels as a form ofso—
cial critique, and these little novels contain a
wealth of memory about the speciﬁc forms
ofpolitical sociability oftliose years,

A: I guess it’s just an awareness or her
lief that the causes for contemporary crime
can be found in the structure and history of
bourgeois culture. Another way of putting
this is that the plots of the novcls hnk the
decomposition of the social world in the
present to unresolved residues oflarge scale
political events~~the Spanish Civil War, for

example, or the Algerian War in the case at
the French. This allows them to treat aspects
ofthesc events thematically in a way that more
formaljstic “high literarure'cﬁ the [19170s and
[19180s was mostly uninterested in doing.

A: In France “the 605" took place over a
ten or 15 year period, but unlike in the [U.S.],
the sixties [in France] were marked by a dis-
tinct event known as May ‘68, when the en
tire country was brought to a hair by violent
strikes and clashes with the police for a period
ofsix weeks. Some nine million people, across
all sectors of public and private employment-
-from department store clerks to ship build-
ers-simply stoppcd working. May ‘68 was
the largest mass movement in French history,
the biggest strike in the history of the French
workers’ movement, and the only “general" in-
surrecrion the over developed world has known
since World War 11,

A: Most people think that the French
opposition to the US. invasion of Iraq was
based simply on a deeprseated aversion to
the politics and style of George Bush. That
aversion 15 there, but French disagreements
with the [us] are grounded in a longer
history that involves deep differences in por
liticdl culture. Simply put, most French (and
western Europeans in general) resist the
idea ofa state, like the American state, that
is designed to serve the economy and noth-
ing else. In our discussion I’d like to look at
key moments in the history of this disagreee
merit: French modernization after the war,
the Vietnam years, and iinally, Iraq,

Talking with
faculty about
about depression

This past Wednesday, Dr. John Westeteld,
a counseling psychologist and professor at the
University oflowa, admitted in his talk to fat
ulty that he had ulterior motives for trying to
educate Grinnell faculty about the signs of po—
tential suicide cases.

Westefeld told the nine staff members pres-
ent that when he was in high school, his close
friend Tony killed himself, and Westefeld's car
rccr since then, including his work with Grin—
nell College concerning the suicides of2003,
has been an attempt to honor Tony.

Westefeld‘s talk represents a part of ad-
ministrations ongoing campaign to educate
people about and prevent depression and suir
cider Westcfeld became involved with the colt
lege soon after spring 2003 as a consultant to
help create facilities and programs.

“Grinnell has really done a phenomenal
job in responding to the suicides two years ago"
he said. “It’s really become... a model for many
other institutions"

Westefeld's lecture was directed toward faC*
ulty, but provided general information for any
one trying to help someone who is depressed
or potentially suicidal, including methods of
prevention, warning signs, and methods of
discussing the problem.

Tom Crady, who organized the event, do
scribes it as part ofa “mullirpronged effort” to
educate anyone in close contact with students,
including faculty, statt, support staff and par-
cuts, of ways to prevent suicide. Crady says
that in the past faculty have been effectively
involved in getting help for students with
mental problems.

He said that “We’ve had faculty walk stu~
dents over to the counseling center," he said.
“We‘ve had faculty and students come to our
ofﬁces and say ‘we need some help'" Accord-
ing to Ctady, many administrators and faculty,
including himself, have had training in suicide
prevention, and that students should not be
afraid to seek help.
