He was liberated from Bergeanelsen in 1945 by British
troops. Heweighed 72 pounds. After rhe war he served as
the erarwrmess in trials involving highly ranked Nazis that
he had worked for in Auschwitz. He the moved to England
and then to rhe United states.

However, Faber did much more than recount the har.

important universal points. The central
theme seemed to be a very simple but
very poignant anti.hare message. The

In these compounds he suffered through severe malnu-

EAG seeks student input on impact Master Plan

Environmental concerns discussed at sparsely attended open forum last week

By Michael Andersen
Slofi erler

The meering on Thursday, Feb. 24 in the
Forum Coffee House that was slated to dis
cuss the environmental impact ofrhe Mas-
ter Plan was attended by nine students, all-
most all ofwhom were either candidates for
SGA omce ntxt year or membersorrhe En»
vironmenral Action Group.

”It sounds like students need more info
than we have given them,” said Vince
Eckhaﬂ, a member ofthe
biology department and
the chair ofthe campus
Advisory Committee on
Environmental Con-
‘eerns, which helped to
organize the gathering.
“we need to play an inc
formational role."

Indeed, much ofthe
discussion orthc meeting
targeted the apparent
lack of student involve-
ment in Master Plan due
cisions. Matt Tragcr ‘02 opened the meet»
ing with the words, “There is very little of
the Masrcr Plan that is thoroughly settled...
this is a common misconception [that plans
are written in stone] "

lr was alsosuggesred rharstudenrs do not
fully understand rho implications orrhe plan:
George Carroll ‘02 speculated that “now that
it's becoming more and more clear that [cco-

here."

tive energy sources]. I

logical friendliness] isn’t the primary objec»
rive of the planners, it might become more
oran issue." Carroll also stressed the will-
ingness ofthe trustees to listen to student
concern, saying “they’re their own biggest
critic on a Ior orrheir mistakes."

“Sustainability is an issue that the col—
lege is concerned about," President Osgood
was quoted as having said.

To date, Explained Trager, only tour de.
velopmenrs have been solidly approved: Sci-
ence 2 (a further ex-
pansion to the Noyce
Center; blueprints
have already been
drawn); cast campus
dormitories; a new
energy center (“espe-
cially the new energy
center"), and a new li-
brary and campus cenv
rer, which are “starting
to be planned."

The proposed en.
ergy center seemed of
special concern to many there. The present
energy center, located just east orNoyee, is
overworked in its rask ofhaatlng and cools
.ng campus buildings,

“we've got it pretty chockrfull orborlcrs
and chillers," explained Mike burr, Associ-
ate Director or Facilities Management.
“There's a lot or sruii, energvalsc, rhar
people don'r know [will be developed in rhe

future], and it makes the planning hard,"
Nevertheless, Butt continued, “sometime
this place is going to have to bite the bullet.
I think student input is key here.“

Among the suggestions put forth were
wind and geothermal energy. Rachel Melis
spoke of a possible admissions beneﬁt: “If
rhe campus wants to right the usual reaction
re a small town in iowa, 1 think something
like [alternate energy] is a good way to do
It.

"Pursuing sustainability and alrernare
energy is important to members orour gen-
eration," added Bnan Turner ’02.

Josh Blue ’01 suggested at the meeting
that the proposed transport of Darby gym
was “the biggest controversy that's been go-
ing around... it doesn’t seem logical if we
could just tear it down.” Carroll agreed, but
said, “I think opinions on Darby are more
ora deal for alums and, to a much lesser ax—
renr, athletes," noting the many new build.
ings that have gone up recently on campus
which former students might not recognize.

Melinda Walters '00 and Angela
Crowleeroch '00 broughr up the idea oia
composting facility as well, possibly to be
connected to rhe new campus center, citing
Kirkwood and Luther as examples otregional
colleges rhar had implemented such pro-
grams. “we'vo been told in the past that the
only rhingmourwuy is facilities,"said Melis.
Eckhart responded favorably bur said “I

think it would be worrh ir for the people

who are deeply interested in that to do some
research."

Despite the many requests that were be-
ing made for potentially complex facilities,
there was a general consensus that modera-
tion was important for cnvironmenta] rea.
sons. Janson worried mat inherently tem»
porary buildings such as Norris Hall and the
Forum were ”envronmentally shortsightcd”
and argued, “ifthcy’t: going to buildabuild.
ing, it should be a long-term, ﬂexible build-
ing,”

Melis spoke to the limits of Grinnell’s
abilities: “Some students seem to have the
impression that, because thnnell has a lot
ofmoney, We should throw away or replace
items whenever we see a short term need to
do so." _

Eckhart concurred; in a previous memo
to the president, his commirree had stressed
“creative uses or remodeled buildings" and
spoken aminsr buildings such as the pro
posed “renhrreen year life span" Computer
services center.

But the moral orthe meeting was clear.
Further student input was needed if any
changes were to rake place, Deadlines wait
for no one, said Tragcr: “irreeommendarions
are going to be made and they’re going to be
included in the Master Plan, now is the
time."
