Cartoons and
Che: Why
you should
go to the
movies this
weekend

he Motorcycle Diaries (

One might expect a film based on the journals
of Latin American revolutionary icon Ernesto “Che"
Guevara tobe a politically charged tale of superhue
man heroics and courage. Fortunately, this is not the
case wirh To: Mulm'cytle Dior-or.

Instead of presenting Che, the burgeoning guer»
rilla, this is a movie about Ernesto, the romantic kid
who's a little bit fed up with medical school and wants
to go out and have adventures for a while instead.
True to the book, the movie covets not only Che’s
growing compassion for the people otLatin America
and collapsing conﬁdence in the existing social order,
but also the scams he and his traveling companion
Alberto Granado (Rodrigo dc la Serna) pull to Score a
freeemcal. the continuing struggle to resuscitate their
dilapidated motorcycle, asthma attacks that are pain»
ful just to watch and one or two awkward tiasros with
women. While a few scenes are about the events that
began to inspire Ernesto to become a revolutionary,
we barely see a glimmer ot‘the Communist warrior he
will someday become.

Despite the absence ofa real focus to the plot,
good cinematography and excellent acting keep the
film interesting. The movie was made on location,
which, in the case of a story about two friends ex-
ploring scum America, means all over the continent.
The audience gets to travel with Ernesto and Alberto
from Buenos Aires to a wealthy Argentinian estate
to Machu Picchu and all the tiny villages on the way.
Guevara is played superbly by award-winning actor
Gael Garcia Bernal, who also starred in ﬂmvrax Pn-
ml and YTu Mama Tambim. And, by way of random
trivia, Granado is played by the second cousin otthe
actual Che.

This is, ofcourse, a film that your friendly campus
radicals may want to go see purely for the historical
signiﬁcance of this period at Che’s life, but that’s no
reason for those who aren’t on the Marxist fringe to
avoid it. Far from being a propaganda ﬁlm, Motorcycle
Dioriartcnds more toward the side or being a good.
oldetashioned growingeup story that simply happens
to have a future Communist guerrilla at its center.
This is a movie that all shades of the political spec—
trum can appreciate.

9 Incredibles (PG)

Want to see an awesome movie? See T122 Inner!-
il'lcs. It’s great. Great to the point of almost being
unsuitable for children great. Seriously

The incredibles are a family of superheroes,
consisting of supcrestrong Poppa Mr. lncrcdiblc
(voiced by Craig T. Nelson, the coach from Comb),
super-stretchy Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), the wilt-
ing and disappearing daughter Violet (public radio
darling Sarah vowcll), speeding son Dash and the
aseyeteunpowered baby Jack Jack.

The catch behind this animated super—pow~
ers showcase is that the Incrediblcs don’t live in a
world that loves them, but rather a society that has
outlawed costumed dorgooding. Instead of lifting
tall buildings, Mr. Incredible works at a bland ins
surance company to support his family.

one day he takes a job from the mysterious Mi-
rage and Syndrome (Jason Lee) that will put him
back in tights, Then comes a villain, an evil plan.
and the rest of tho fixings for a great superhero
movie.

Tl]: Inn-edit?!“ is an animated movie,but it’s not
necessarily . ldds’ movie. There is onescrcen vio»
lence, and bar-elyeottescrcen deaths galore, which
may frighten some Davis buddies, Since there's no
blood, and the Disney and Pixur labels are ilffLVCd
to the credits, it still cites out a PG rating.

The Illil‘L’ﬁ/I'b/A‘I has more than just action set
pieces ripped off from fame: Band and other two
dimensional action movies. Mr. Incredible, ElaSr
tigirl and their black friend Frozone (Samuel L.
Jackson) all struggle to live in a world that won’t let
them do what they’re best at.

As young Dash espouses, saying that everybody
is special is just another way of saying that no one
is. Tim Incredible: isn’t advocating “might maltes
right," but rather arguing that if people are capable
and willing to save your life, you may as well let
them.

No project, save for the julriw League cartoon,
has transferred the energy and spectacle orsuper—

heroes as accumtcly and exquisitely as The Incredi-
omwnile it haltcomments on issues offamily and
foolish cgalitarianism, T12: Inner/[Hat is [or people
whojust want to have fun.

i lenlum Actress (PG)

Director Satoshi Kon packs a lot into Mil/mirror
Actions 87 minutes, and at times it seems almost too
much. Documentarian Genya Tachibana is obsessed
with the legendary Japanese actress Chiyoko Fuji-
wara, who now lives in seclusion after disappearing
from the public eye thirty ycars ago, and visits her to
request an interview. What follows is a trip through
Fujirmra’s own past and an anrmc rendition ofone of
the most overused cinematic themes—the pursuit of
a love lost,

Through Tachibanas documentary, we learn why
Fujiwara abandoned an illustrious career and mass
adoration. A mysterious stranger, a political dissir
dent whom she harbored tor a short period of time,
handed her a key and then disappeared. it was love
at tirst sight, so predictably, she has been search»
ing for him ever since. Present and past, tea it and
myth intertwine as Fujiwara-recounts Japanese hiss
[cry through her roles in historical epics, and literally
takes Tachibana and his comic relief cameraman with
hcr‘ithey become so engrossed in her tales that they
actually become characters in her movies.

i absolutely loved Spit-rod Away rn 2002, and l
naively ctpcctcd something similar out of this film. I
know next to nothing aboutJapanese anime, but I get
the feeling that iWil/urizlm [1:21:13 is much more what
anirne is really about and Spirited/11010! was made for
unawarc Americans like myself.

That said, Mil/minim A: 'eir is a truly great ﬁlm
that leaves the realm of animated fiction and enters
that ofhnman emotion. It is at times convoluted and
seemingly too somber to be animated, but ultimately
deserves the standing ovation it received at its world
premiere.
