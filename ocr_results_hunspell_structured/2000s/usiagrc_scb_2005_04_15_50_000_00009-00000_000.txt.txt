“Culture of life” needs liberal response

For the Republican Party, it must have seemed like
Christmas come early. A few short months after President
Bush talked up his newest catchphrase, “culture of life," in
his stare orthe Union address,Terri Schiavo dropped
into their political laps. Rookie senator Mel Mai»
tinez (RrFL) apparently thought so, when he ace
cidentally handed a ineriio to Tom Harltin (DelA)
that was meant for other GOP Senators.‘

“[Sel rim] is an important moral issue and the
pro life base will be e§cited the Senate is debating /
this important issue, the inetno read, listing
eight talking points in slrpport oflegislalron
to move Mrs. Schiavo's (or Shiavo, as the
memo spelled it) case to federal eour ts

As it happened, intervening in the
scliiavo case wasn't even remotely popus
lat, Not even the death of Pope John Paul
II, the man who allegedly coined the term
“culture oflrfe"as a description ofhis ant'ir
abortion, anti-death penalty crusade,could
make this into political gold for the GOP.
Polls showed that the American people.
including such subgroups as “Republicans"
and “white evangelical Christians,” op—
posed intervention.

This shouldn't be a cause for celebrar
tron on the part of liberals. lntervening
with Terri Schiavo turned out to be a
dud for Republicans because they tried to
tromp on the Constitution, not because the American public
disagrees with the conservatives on positions like abortion
and euthanasia,

In fact, conservatives will continue to win by default as
long as they talk about a “culture oflife" and liberals counter
with legal nitpicking. Agree with its implications or not, “culr

With Republicans on moral issues,

rure oflit'c" is a bold, catcliy statement, If Democrats want to
win more than 48% of the country, they can‘t be afraid to go
lreadsto—head with Republicans on moral issues.

That means coming up with a resonant theme. Where
this comes from is uncertain, bill one idea could come from
a New York Times article written on March 27 hyjohn Le-
land. Looking at the Schiavo debate, Leland attempted to

outline what philosophy lay behind the two sides:

“The plea last weclt to prolong Ms. Schiayo's feeding,

against the wishes of her husband or what courts deter-

mined to be her own expressed inclinations, echoed
the teachings of Aristotle, who considered existence
itself to be iiwiolahlc.

“On the other side,
the argument that Ms.
Schiavo’s life could be
judged as not worth liv-
ing echoed Descartes,

the Enlightenment phlr
losoplrer who deﬁned
human life not as bio~
logical cxistenct—which
might be an irwiolable

gift from God but as consciousness, about
wliicl \ pcopl e can make Judglnclils

Leland went on to cite several liistori-

cal examples ofhow these ideas have played
out. Aristotelian ideas about life fueled abor
litionists in their fight against slavery, Le—
land wrote, while Enlightenment ideas led to such shameful
moments as a supreme Court decision validating the sterile
ization otthe mentally retarded Ouch.

In a slight quibble with Leland, in laying out his points,

he blended two ideas into one, which he then ascribed to
Descartes. On the one hand,you have the idea that humanity

is determined not by simple existence but rather by capacity
for rational thought. On the other, you have the distinctly
modernist idea that existence can be quantified and mea-
surerl.

Admittedly, the two have orten been pair-ed together. But
they are separate notions, and in my opinion, it is unfair to
express them as one and the same Emphasizing the primacy
ofthe human spirit rather than biological existence is not a
cold, heartless way to judge some people’s lives as worth less
than others. if anything (at the risk of cribbing too much
from Sartre), it is more humane.

cultural liberals don't have to struggle to come up with
a response to the “culture oflife" themes.
The ideological framework already exists
Although “culture ofconsciousness" would
be too trite at the least, it captures the right
idea. Cultural liberals believe that we're all
on an equal footing because we think, not
because we breathe.

Attempts to regulate abortion, forbid
gay marriage,and impose a particular brand
ofChristianity on the nation are offensive
because they attack the basic capability of
people to make their own decisions. What liberals stand for
is the fundamental competence of our eir ens, and that the
government shouldn't be legislating nonruniversal morality
into the privatc realm.

If liberals want to reverse the Democratic Party’s recent
slide, they need to stand up and right when conservatives
try to claim the moral high ground. While Republicans may
have overreac’hed by trying to intervene in the Terri Sclrravo
case. Democrats can't count on that in the future. Keeping
to the current course of avoiding moral issues would mean a
third straight disappointing November.

Happy Birthday, Dad.

Grinnell is not its own country

We are deeply appalled by the majority
of the responses on the website http://t'nrtdc—
bighered,tom/izcwt/2005/03/Z9/g7iil71:]! from
Grinnell students. The comments made
by some claim to reﬂect the entire student
body

We do not agree with statements such
as, “students are
incredibly and
almost unauir
inously angry at
the actions of
the school." Not
everyone is un-
happy with the
actions taken by
the administration and the authorities; we
are angered by the lack of reason and coins
mon sense used by some current students.

This is in no way humorous, and it very
much reminds us ofthe Gum article (yes we
brought it up again) released almost 2 years
ago. There are certain subjects such as race
and violence that cannot be treated in such
a manner in open forums without repeicus-
slot-rs.

They can be interpreted as threatening to
those who do not know Paul and his “sense

And according to one current student,
"Perhaps there is evidence of the petpetrm
tors of past school violence posting on the
Internet, however, these kids were not at-

forum."

No, there were mistakes made in the
past, and campus administrations and law
enforcement agencies throughout the coutv
try are trying to avoid making the same lnls»

comments for?

It does not matter
whether Paul was serir
ous or not. Had those
thoughts been actualized
at all, in the aftermath
you would then blame the
administration for not
acting.

It is a n0‘\’Vlll situa»

or don't take any action and have people who
tear for their safety become angered at the
administration for not protecting them.

It is easy to blame the administration.

Respect diversity
we need diversity at GrinnellVVC need respect. We

need a community that listens to each other .uid con-

no choice. Selfrgovcrnanee should mean that we s-
sunic from the very beginning that pcoplc around us
have different opinions and beliefs, and we should act
in a manner that would not offend them. I hope that
when discussions are held about what d sity means

Paul, for his lack of tact.

If you want your voice to be heard, do it
responsibly. The ability to question author-
ity and social norms and practices are things
we too love about Grinnell, but the right to
violently threaten authority or a fellow slur
dent rs not extended to anyone under any
circumstances.

Overall, as a liberal arts
student, use your critical
analysis skills to acknowlr
edge Grinnelrs propensity
to thwart the opinions of
the less vocal, there are
many who remain silent
and think this was the
right course of action.

We are writing on be-
half of these individuals. Grinnell rs not a
tiny bubble where we are isolated from the
consequences of the real world.
