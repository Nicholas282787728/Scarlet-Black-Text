5v MARISA WHlTLEY

The South Australia Institute of
Sport tiavcled halfway across the globe
to visit the US. and give a handful of
promising Australian athletes a chance
to play some basketball. The team
made a stop in Iowa to play against an
exhibition match against a small D 111
school last Friday and it was promptly
sent packing with a467121 loss.

The exhibition match and lastTues—
day’s win against Mount Mercy mak-
ing the Pioneers +0 in the preseason.

So far this season, the men have
demonstrated excellent teamwork, es—
pecially for a team in which one-third
of the members are ﬁrsteyenrs new
to the fulltcourt pressing style that
Grinnell is known for.

“We’re much more advanced this
year than we were last year at this
point," said forward Doug Ticus '07.

“[Against Cornell] we showed a
lot of chemistry for the ﬁrst game of
the year. it gave us something to build
on said guard Toby Carlson 0 "Our
preseason was very competitive in our
open gyms It made things really great
and formed a good team chemistry."

The men beat Cornell 136 112 aft
tor a dominating performance by several
ﬁrstsyears. John Grotberg ’09 brought

The Pioneers are deﬁnitely taking
advantage ofrlie home games early in
the season,

“A lot of the weaknesses will be
seen when we play in an environment
that's not as friendly as when we play
at home," saidjiick Kennedy ’06. "We're
gonna win every game at home, guar~

Swimming and diving come out on top after a grueling weekend

EV Auuv RAPOPORT

The mens and womens swimming and diving
teams don’t waste time in water or on land.The sWim—
ming and diving teams had hack-to-back meets on
Nov. 18 and Nov. 19 The Pioneers barely had time
to dry themselves off, competing until 10:30 pm.
ayinst Loras and then leaving at 7: 30 the next morn-
ing for Illinois to play the University ofChicago. The
women‘s team won both meets but the men were den
feated at the University of Chicago,

The team’s composure during the twotday blitz
left Coach Erin Hurley and the team captains very
optimistic about the rest ofthe season.

Both the men's and women’s swimming and d'W’
ing teams made strong showings in the Lords meet.
The women won the meet 136-101 while the men
ﬁnished with an impressive l4ls94 victory.

“I knew if we swam really well we'd win, and we
swam really well, "said Hurley. On the women's team,

The Pioneer men held their own against Loras.

Peter Brown 06 was a double winner in the 100 free

Captain Daniel Shryock 05 was not surprised by
the victory, "[Loras] just doesn't have our depth," he
said.

Unfortunately for the men’s team, Friday’s mo,
mentum did not carry into Saturday's meet. Hurley
attributed this loss in part to the physical strain ot
two days of swimming and in part to the fact that,
due to differing conference regulations, the University
of Chicago had been conditioning four weeks longer
than Grinnell.

Despite these disadvantages, the women did top
the University of Chicago, thanks to performances
from several individuals and support from the entire

“Even towards the end ofthe final meet the en-
thusiasm and support didn't falter once," said Stcyer.

The Grinnell womens basketball team opened Its '057 06 sched
ule on a positive note, posting two wins in its ﬁrst three games.

"coming into the season we didn't really have a feel for how we
were going to do because we didn’t feel that our record last year res
flected our talent," said Katy Bowen '05,“lt was nice to get a couple
of wins to start the season. I think that has helped our conﬁdence
a Little bit."

A pair ofwins is a refreshing start for the team, which retooled
its offense last season and ﬁnished with a record of 5717.

Last Tuesday, Bowen and Hannah Wolf’OB led the Pioneers
to a solid victory over visiting Central College. After heading into
halftime down seven points, Grinnell crime out firing, supported
by solid threespoint shooting and pressure defense. Wolf knocked
down seven threetpointers and posted 27 points. Bowen added 14
points and Laura Burton ’08 went thiee for set from behind the arc
and ﬁnished with 11 points. As time ran out, Grinnell was on the
upside ofa 77,70 score.

The Pioneers kept the momentum going during the weekend
as they headed out to Clinton, Iowa, for the River City Shootout
Tournament. They opened against Asliford and had a rivcspoint
lead at the half. Once again, the Pioneers came out strong in the
second half, onlscoring Asliford 36-20 in the second 40 minutes
of the game, Wolf led the way with 19,13owcn posted another 14,

Katie Schumacher ’08 scored 10 and Emily Kolbe 07 owned the

perimeter, hitting (lust of tour trom three- -point teiiitory for nine
oints.

F “We feel really good about our progress so far, especially after

how last season went foi us," said Wolf. “There‘s nothing better than

to open up with a couple wins right away after a year like that."

On Sunday, the Pioneers squared otragaiust a morc difficult op—
ponent, St. Ambrose.The women fell 28 points behind early in the
game and a strong second halfwasn’t enough to make up the deﬁcit,
giving them their first loss of the season.

“I think both the women and the coaching staffare pleased with
the Ztl start," said Head Coach Andy Hamilton. “We defeated
Central, a team which completely destroyed us last year, and our
second victory over Ashford was a very well»played game from start
to finish. Our only loss came to st. Ambrose, which is a very good
team. In that game we gave good effort but could have used a little
more poise and patience.”

“Our biggest challenge is going to be to get better on the boards,"
said Bowen. “We are a bit undersized compared to many teams in
the conference and we are going to have to ﬁnd a way to get bettei
positioning for the reboundst"

The Pioneers will open a difficult conference schedule this
weekend at home as they face off against Beloit this evening and
Ripon on sanirday afternoon.
