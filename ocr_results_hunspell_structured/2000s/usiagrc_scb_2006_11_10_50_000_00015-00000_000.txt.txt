Japinga: An eXcessively cynical NBA preview

November is a slow month for most sports
fans. The baseball season has come to an end,
which means that something else must tide us
one. between weekend tootball games. Since
many sports fans
are turning their ate
tention toward the
NBA,1 feel it is my
civic duty to churn
outanNBA preview
(but not necessarily ,

a stereotypical one.)
My can’tsri-riss predictions are below:

- \iBA tans wrll once again lack the ability
to cheer for their team it not backed by a PA
announcer, a prc-rccordcd piccc of audio or
the latest Billboard chart topper, Because realr
ly, who's got the time to be passionate enough
about a team to actually make up cheers, make
noise when it's appropriate and expect that all

oftlies: instructions won't be spoon-red to the
fan? Creativity is tor collcgc students, and they
cant arrord NBA ticltcts anyway,

- The league will encapsulate Dwyane
Wade in an net
tual bubble so that
fouls become sig-
nificantly casicr tor
aging referees to
call. Anyone who
touches Wade's
bubble, acciden»
tally or not, will be whistled for a foul. The
NBA will offer copies of this bubble to LeB-
ron James, Kobe Bryant, Shaq and Allen lvcrr
sort and WIN fund the project by ﬁning Dale
las Mavericks 0\‘\'n€l’/i‘ef*liﬂl6|‘ Mark Cuban a
onetime ice of $500,000.

-The regular season will end by Christmas,
as the NBA decides that the playoffs need to

rivet the country.

- Isaiah Thomas will miraculously turn
around the Knicks and lead them to a 50*win

- Stuart Scott and Stephen A. Smith will
lead ESPN's NBA coverage by providing vicw-
ers'with 15 solid minutes ofincoherent babble
bctore everygamc. Token white analyst Tim

Legler will attempt to provide a sane voice for
confused viewer's by jumping in to make a cor
hctcnt piece otanaiysis, but Stephen A’s yell-
ing will cause chler’s head to explode.

~ Sincc former Sacramento King Bonzi
Wells is now a Houston Rocket, Ron Artest
will follow up on his orrscason promise that
“If he leaves, then I’m going to kill him.“ In
his defense, Artest will claim that since he has
a new rap album out (My World dropped Oct,
31, it anyoncs interested), he just promoted it
like cvery other rapper by getting involved in a
shooting, Kings fans will not be shocked.

‘1Wll.l again attempt to endure a couple of
NBA games over break, but will then realize
that inferior tans, prctctcntial star treatment,
horrible rcferccing, the lack of team play and
annoying analysts aren't going to make me
love this gnu-re anytime soon, Get back to me
if Ron Artest goes completely insane.
