Walk a Mile event educates central Iowa with high heels

av AMES ANTHOFER

The high heel is a prime symhol or male objectiﬁcation of
women, as the heel visually extends the leg and causes great dis-
comfort to the wearer. This weekend, men will be given a chance
to experience the pain ofhigh heels for a good cause.

This Sunday. between 12 and 4 pm men from Poweshiek,
Marshall. Jasper and Tania counties will walk a mile in high heels
to raise awareness of issues ofdomestie violence and sexual assault
against women,

Organizations all over the world, including various Iowa int
sritiitions, sponsor the event as a part oprnl's Sexual Assault
Awareness Month. Last year, a fraternity at Central College held
the same event to beneﬁt a crisis intervention center in their come
munity.

This year, Susan Klunipner'o9 and Helen l3mley'09 helped or-
ganize the event with The Domcsnc Violence Alternatives/Selma
Assault Center (DVA/ SAC) in Marshalltown.

“were basically a small project trying to do a big rhing,"
Klumpner said.

Klumper and Bailey have heen intenis at the center since rhe
beginning of the year, working nights with dedicated wonien.The
center stretches its resources over Poweshiekrvlarshall, Jasper and
Tama counties.

Earlier this semester, Klumpner and Bailey decided to start a
fundraisrng project, to raise money for the DVA/SAC in the race
oreconomic hardships and government ciithacks. For advice, they
went to the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assualt (ICASA),
which suggested Walk a MileThey presented the project to the
leaders at the shelter, and then the hard work began. “I’ve never
planned an event like this before," Bailey said.

First, Klumplter and Bailey had to ﬁgure out where the event
would take place. Traditionally, the walk traverses city streets for
awareness, due to the fact that Walk a Mile, like the drag show

during Pride Weelc is not just for tundrarsing, but also to educate
ahout gender variance. After examining their options in Marshall-
town, they decided to hold the evenr at an elementary school.

Planning the event also included taking measures that the or-
ganizers had not anticipated. “Because we're using a tmdcmnrked
name, we have to follow certain rules," l<lumpner said. They had
to sign an organizers agreement, order the shirts of? of 11111171}.
Inkeam/kilz/meaermg and communicate with Lhe international
organization to make sure they were in accordance with regular
tions. However, due to a conﬂict With the Marshalltown High
School prom, they could not have it during Sexual Assault AwarCn
ncss Month.

Arrer scheduling, Klumpner and Bailey realized they needed
shoes for the went. The fraternity M Ccntrnl provided many of
them, hut for the large sizes they contacted Barney, an online mcrr
chant whose company creates shoes for drug shows.

Advertising was another factor to consider. For this, they
sought the assistance of rho Feminist Action coalition (FAC),
which ran Take Back the Night last week.

“I had no idea how much work they had done yer." Klumpncr
said. "Helen had written a press release, and a conract list, and
Anna Friel [‘10] and I sent it out and then called a hunch or radio
stations.”

Collaboration between the two groups did not end there.
“We’re going to have other stuff at the event speciﬁc to other sex-
ual assault awareness projects,” Klumpner said. “Katie's hanging
in the Clothesline Project [from the Spencer Giill], for example."

FAC will also he one often groups with a booth at the events
which will feature DVA/SAC advocates from tlie,college and
other community organizations, such as the Grinneil Chamber of
Commerce,

Klumpner and B. iley plan to have a he DJ and band at the
event, and a motley crossrscction orlowa life will also he pi esent,

“The Marshallrown High School principal got really excited
about the project," Bailey said. “So most of the boys’ athletic teams
will be at the event too."

Katie Jones '10 encountered similarly enthuSIastic reactions
in her door-ro-door work in Grinnell. “I thought people might
be uncomfortable, but no one was,"Joncs said. “The woman at
the Pizza Hut was like ‘We'rc not allowed to put these up in the
front of the store, but I'll put it in the employee rooml’ She was so
wonderfuldwas sort ofworricd ahour rhc town, but everyone was
really excited.”

In Jones’ work with the career Leadership Council planning
the Piitle Parade last month, she found that discussions about int
eluding the town in the event planning brought up many or her
orig‘nal concerns about the town. “They couldn’t ﬁgure out a good
loop system [for the parade], and they thought it would be kind of
weird to have it end in town," she said.“1don‘tthere's a lot of focus
on stun during Pride Week about doing saierin rhe community.
I think' its mostly focused on Grinnell People want to do it, but
they havcnt really yet"

Brian Perbix 09 has been one offew men involved with DVA/
SAC ever since he heeame a peer advocate as a second year. He
believes that most campus activists struggle with the planning of
such events as Walk a Mile.

“I think a lot ofacrivism around sexism and grndcrism is {0*
cused on hroadening the scope or this work," Perbix said, “It's one
dung to talk ahout rhis stuffiii a closed Liberal arts community, hut
it’s deﬁnitely more dirfmtlr to hring it into the real world."

Perblx also mentioned that the gender ratio often starts offlcss
skewed in tminings,hut after some time, women sricltwith it more
than men.

“From my caperience, men typically don’t go to Take Back
the Night events,” said Perbix. “Maybe this will help change the
perception that this is a women’s issue."
