Brétzmann brings abrasive and unique brand of jazz

German jazzman to play music from his 40—year career that sounds as if it were shot out of a cannon.

thnkkJAPlNGA

When jazz musician Peter Brorzmann visits Gardner
for a 7:30 show tonight as part of his month-long U.S.
tour, don't expect a repeat of March’s Wynton Marsalis
performance. Asked in a 2003
interview with All About Jazz
wherhcr he considers himself a ,
“jazz musician," Brotzmann tee
spondcd, "if it has to do with
Lincoln Center and this [Ken]
Burns guy, and Michael Dorff
and all that crap,l don’t want to
have to do something With that," he said. “But, if it comes
out of the tradition or the real meaning of the music, if
somebody would call me a jazz musician, that would make
me a little proud.”

lfyou had to categorize Brotzmann, hc’d end up some»
where in the free jazz or free improvisational movements,
where he has been most commonly associated throughout
his 40-year career. But all questions ofgenre become irrelr
evant once Brétzmann
truly finds his rhythm,

wants to attack them,
, consuming you in a bare
rage of harsh and abrar

sive notes.
Within the melee, though, is a strong sense oflyricism,
proof that Brotzmann has mastered his form. The melody
is evident throughout, with a hint ofblues and bebop, and

ble wall ofysound. It’sjazz, for surcihis bassist, Eric Rel/is,
spent ten years playing with Brantford Marsalisibut it’s
jazz unlike anything most people have ever heard before.

His style distinguishes itself not only in the music, but
also in merely watching the performers onstage. In videos
with his drummer Nasheet Waits, Brotzmann’s body ﬂails,
he paces around the stage and his fingers cascade up and
down his saxophone, all while Waits drums like a crazed
maniac. It’s a testament to their skill—as well as their
seemingly limitless energy—that their sound and flair only
help bring out their technical proﬁciency.

It's always hard to proclaim that a concert will be the
most unique ofthe year. But hetwccn Brotzmann’s carccr,
his in-your—face sound, and the guaranteed energy the con-
cert will surely bring, tonight's show might have a case.
