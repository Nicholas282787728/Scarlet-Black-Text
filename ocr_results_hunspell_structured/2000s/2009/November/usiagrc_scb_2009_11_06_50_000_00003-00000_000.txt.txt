How did your education at Griunell shape your interests?
How does it still change you today?

lryou'd listened tonight, you’d hear someone who was being
verv critical ofall the evidence, I leally lealncd that skill set at
Grinnell Thats what I think you learn better at Glinnell than
anything else. Grinnellians~whether they re on the artsy side
or the sciency side, the top ofthe class oi the bottom—do this
well. I call that critical thinking.

We actually discourage critical thinking at professional
schools. Ph. D. programs may be different, but maybe not. You
do have to create something. At the beginning, you’rejust overs
whelmed with learning, so you just want easy rules. I remember
I had a resident who created these little cards called Bragg’s
Laws, like an amp [small unit of measurement] of anything
never hurts. Another one was if the patients in arrest, you've
got nowhere to go but up. Patient’s still not breathing, tongue’s
out, banging on their chest, you just try an amp of this, an amp

ofthal I mean its that kind ofthinking simplicity thatgets you
started, but a lot of doctors never go beyond that,and1 think it
would be harder fol a Grinnellian not to go beyond than

There’s always this sense afdiscovtery, too. You said our
ing the presentation that you consider yourself
kind ofa hardass.

Well, first ofall, I didn't plan to go into cancer.
That was a fluke, I wanted to avoid cancer, all those
dying patients, remembering all those names of
cancer types. I didn’t like it, I just thought I’d skip
it. It's kind of biology. like where you learn those
[taxonomies], where you classify all the plants and
animals and so on.That’s what cancer ms when I
was in medical school.

So I went into the lab in my third year, and
then finally got really turned on by it, so i went to
the cancer institute. They had all the money and the best labs.
So I went down there anyd I realized that my patients were dy—
ing every day and part of' it was the crap that we were giving
them.You say, we've gotta find something betterthan this. And
what keeps you together is testing things that are new and difs
ferent, because you know that they're going to die anymy and
the stutryou'te giving them has these terrible side effects.You're
happy to have some new drug to try, some new approach, and
that comes from the critical mind.

It sounds like you're advocating for maybe something like
a more holistic approach to medicine,

Well no. Well yes. 0k, so almost all of my patients have
psychological problems, and if you had cancer and were fac»
ing death, you would probably have them, too. so do 1 need
to send them all to a shrink? No, I'm a cancer doctor. 1 should
be taking care etthose. Now some ofthem are going to be too

severe, like ifthey need Lithium for a bipolar disorder, which is
exacerbated by cancer, then I'll get a shrink in. But for most of
them I should be able to take care ofthem. After all, every docs
tor is trained in psychiatric disorders, it's part of your medical
training, So in that sense,yeah, more holistic.

Do you think this sort of training should be emphasized
more in medical school?

Yeah. But it‘s not very sexy. I mean think about the things
you’re interested in at 25 or 18 are very different than the things
you're interested in when you're so or so. It's the way it is. I’m
not so certain that “train” is all that importantYou have to learn
a certain amount of things the hard way. Now I won't say it's
unimportant

For example, when I was medical student, we used Kublers
Ross. She was one or the ﬁrst people to write books on death
and dying, and she was a nurse and a nun, I believe. She talked
about the stages of dying, and she kind ofsystemized it. Nowl
think there were a lot of things, as 1 got more experienced, that
were wrong in her story, but it enabled me to ask questions and
think about it, and so in that sense it was good.

On the other hand, you can't take someone who’s intrin-
sically insensitive and who never listens and turn them into
a sensitive doctor with training. Sometimes patients will ask

Doc, why did you do this like this?" And Ill say Because
my mother trained the to do it like that. It wasnr somethingI
learned in medical school." My mother's been very important
in how I practice medicine. You can't leave Grinnell after four
years without examining your values seriously. It's an intrinsic
part of what’s Grinnell.
