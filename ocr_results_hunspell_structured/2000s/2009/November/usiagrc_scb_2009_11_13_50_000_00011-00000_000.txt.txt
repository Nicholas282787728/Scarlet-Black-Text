Noyce Science centrr

Carnegie Hall

Campus Bookstore

The Forum

Burling Library

Bucksbaum Center for the Arts

John Crystal Center

Pnrk Street Offices

If there are any other locations that peo-
ple believe should be delivered to or if there are speciﬁc spots in
these locations that would be ideal for delivery, let us know and
we ll add them to the list.

On a similar note, after our longtime printer closed earlier
this year, we switcl bed to a new printer based in Marshalltown.
Due to diiferenr scheduling, the newspaper has been, and likely
will, arrive around i p.m.,rather than 11:30 a.m.,as it has been
in years past. We apologize for this inconvenience, bur make
sure to check back if you don’t see it at noon. ,

Effects of ﬁle campus climate assessment for us

Distribution practices and campus climate results

150 students (reel) 1).Hcr prcscnml‘ion reiterated many con,
cerns that a numhel ofstudents on campus hive voiced about
the level oi acceptance on the Grinnell College campus

Dr. Rankin presented statistics that dispelled myths and
cnlighrenetl attendees about the actual levcls ofdiscti‘nnnauon

. that occur on Campus. For example, she cited survey data \hut
indicated filculn', stuft and students

from tradition Llly marginalized

groups reportedly avperience
; harassment and discrimina-
tion rinn those from majority
groups. Students, facility and
staff of color, sexual “1aner
ties, people with physical and
psychologigal disabililies and
people of lower socioeco-
nomic standing are all among

_ the. groups that responded through

the survey that Rankin and her associares distributed last year,

The results of the Survey conﬁrmed that Grinnell is not as
much of a warm, protective bubble as it is often claimed to be.
As much as we call ourselves a progressive and liberal college
oriented towards social justice, that is not an inherent quality
Grinnell cannot be such an institution without consistent hard
work on the part of its students, faculty and staff to initiate and

~have open discussions, no matter how scelnihgly uncomfort-
able they my be, about issues regarding class, race, gender and
ablcism. .

With these newly published statistics at hand, we should
all be thinking about how we, as individuals, can better foster
a more accepting and aware campus environment and how we
can initiate these often difﬁcult, but ultimately beneﬁcial con—

versarions. We cnn'r just rely on groups like Alust and No
Limits to do all the legwork for the entire campus—we
should all be active in our everyday interactions, whether
that be in class, or lunch or on Mac Field.

it doesn’t take any large changes in our daily rauilnes,
but it does take an iutcn 'onal effort on llic'pﬂrt of the
greater campus community to challenge inslances of op-
pression as they arise.

Goodbye, limbo’ . We will all miss you greatly

Grinnell lost an icon this week. After many years of busi—
ness, James Sadlcr- Tanzosch 88 of limbos Pizza and Pub f1-
nally derided to shut rhe doors to one of the only delivery res—
raumnts in Grinnell.

The Grinnell community is saddened lhar limbo decided
to end his efforts at providing the campus and town with a piz-
zcria in which we him all rake pride. It was a good feeling giving
limbo, an ulum, our support. Whether you only ordered occa-
sionally oi know the menu by heart,]imbo’s closing is Lhe typo
ofncws that can only make a week worseThe ubiquitous ﬁlm
and fancy yellow delivery car, the study break special, rhe pizza
buffet and the cheesy bread are all gone—only our memories
of these sociable solicitations remain No longer can we take
parents or your out of town friends and say, Well, at least we
have limbo s.

We will miss the pizza ordered at 11.47 p. m. on a Thursday
when a paper is due the next day. We will miss walking into
the wonderful aroma ofpina after a cold winter walk We will
miss seeing an entire restaurantfull of acquaintances and a tablé
full of friends GoodbyeJimbos We will miss you with all our
heavy hearts and empty stomachs

The dream frOm an enlightened freshmanls perspective

Through the dim light and humming

voices ofIntimate Dining, w: stuffed down
our juicy came asada steak and spanakopira
like cadets aboard a submarine, with deep-
oecan lighis and a churning engine room,
cramped for space, cnergy and time. There
we were, two young men hard at work, div
cussing the project ofwhat it means to live
the good life.
“Yeah, it’s nice to
have gotten pracr
tical tips [about
Grinncll] but
even rhoug Asa
goes here, that
doesn’t necessar-
ily mean I have it figured out," said Isaac
Wilder '13, an enthusiastic young Dreamr
Liver whose brother, Asa Wilder '10, is
studying abroad in Leuven, Belgium.

Some of you may know lsaac from
Cleveland Hall, Cleveland Lounge or
maybe even Cleveland Beach. Hell, maybe
you vc even noticed that suave pseudo sir
per model- -1ooking chap in the low cut in
shirts and pointy leather boots strutting his
stuff on the danec floor in Gardner on any
given Frldity night. But how many of you
know that Isaac spent the year after high
school living in India, or rhat he has ascri—

ous passion for cooking? “I get my Zen on
in the kitchen,”Wilder said, as I frantically
scribbled notes. “Why?" you might ask,
as I did that night. Because ”whether it's
cooking, making model rockets, or’f‘cking
jumping into piles of leaves...rhis is the
place to explore any passion,"hc said.
As an increasingly jaded senior, it is
easily possible
to lose site of
the peculiar and
exciting opr
porrunities that
Grinnell of—
fats its students.
Each day, there
are several if not multiple chances for all of
us to experiment with or hone in on what-
ever it is that puts the spring in our step, be
it psychic, social or intersubjective. Accord
ing to lsaae, who as a firsrryenr has “only
five out of 24 hours in the day committed
to," there is plenty of room at Grinnell to
do whatever it is one is passionate nhour.
For Isaac, and hopefully .nnuy orhers like
him, one must work hard and nor waste the
chance to really do what one loves, because,
as he said, “you can’t stand on mounliun
tops unless you climb mounnuus "
When I asked what “living the dream"

meant to him, Isaac told me something
about his past, both growing up in a big
family, as well as that year in Indiar'Tm not
much of a Jew..." he began, with a smile
on his face, “...but there’s a cool concept,
Tikkun Olam. It means 'to heal the world.’
That‘s the good lifeito soothe, to make
anorher's life beautiful. We need to do
things that leave a positive work or erase
a scar, not force our concepts of happiness
onto other people. In India, there were peo-
ple living on the streets with smiles on their
face, because anyone can
genuinely love their life."
Though not all of us
may have the leisure time
ofa first semester first year,
we can all certainly do our
part to do something posi»
live or heal at least a small
part of the world, in whal-
ever Capacity in which we
see hr. in the and, to. Isaac, and perhaps
for us all, “it's about going, not getting“ to
wherever it is we ale headed.

about Grinnell that gets our motors hoat~

rial about the Wire or being sure to enjoy
all twenty gourmet meals, even on those
Pork Vindaloo nights. As for you seniors
out there on the unstable life raft ﬂoating
between that Teach For America position
and “rock bottom," don't forget to remem-
her that you aren't defined by your grades
or even your social justice portfolio, but by
the sum ofall your dreams and how big it is
that you live them.

Before we cleared our trays, Isaac told
me a story ofthc future, a future I sure hope
to live in. “I want computr
ers to understand human
language before I die, and
someday I want to go to
the moon," he said, “and
that‘s not an unreason—
able thing to say." He’s
right, it’s not unreasonr
ablc, because it’s a dream
yet to be lived. And what ,
is more, it's about the going, not the get-
ting, and that's aleryr somethingworrh be-
ing passionate nhour. As for the rest of us,
maybe we're srrll working on finding what
makes us tick. Hopefully someday, someday
soon, we'll figure it out, and maybe then
we'llbe“llv1ng the dream,"
