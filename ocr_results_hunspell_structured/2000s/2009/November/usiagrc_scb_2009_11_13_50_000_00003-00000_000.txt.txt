You've done a lot of recent work on climate chain c mit

g
grants and human rights. What are some ofdic major issues
facing thesc migrants?

There are a number of CHUCAl issues now. One is that if
the climate change predictions hold true, there will bc major
droughts, water scarcity, more disasters and people in vulner-
able communities, particularly Africa, who are already seeking
to use migration as a coping strategy, or people in Mexico, or
people' in Asia for that matter—they will be forced to migrate
even further distances So ifyou take the example of Senegal
which may lose 50 percent orits crop production, they already
have a signiﬁcant migration population that's moving across
the Mediterranean to Europe. They also have a signiﬁcant
population moving to other countries in Africa, just in terms of
movement for economic reasons. Ifyou add the climate change
factor onto that, which affects even their ability to return at
times, they may be forced to not only migrate to some other
place in Senegal or some other place in Africa but all the way
over to the European continent.

We don't have any rules or laws that permit that. And in
faci, within the African continent, they only adopted a treaty
allowing people to move across borders a couple orweelts ago.
But in Africa, it’s an example of people, especially in sub-Saha-
ran Africa, moving across the borders all the time. The ethnic
groups and tribes that had aristed before colonialism were no~
madic around many diiterent regions. So people are generally
inclined to migrate.

The African Union just adopted a treaty, a very {arreaching
treaty, knowing that climate change and environmental di-
sasters are going to force migration, but the rest of the world
doesn't have than t

Sowill nations have to change the my they are contribut—
ing to climate change or start working on how to aceommcr
date these migrants, or both?

Probably both, since some ofthe climate change predictions
say that changes to the weather patterns are irreversible, and
were going to see more climate changes before we see less .°f
them. Governments are deﬁnitely recogn'
ing that these' issues are looming,and haven't
really the means yet to address them. Some
governments have -actunlly identiﬁed mi-
gration in their national adaptation plans,
So those are the documents that would be
used when and if governments negotiate an
agreement in Copenhagen to fund adaptat
[ion programs
But that raiscs other problems, Because
if one government’s plan is to relocate a
group or people who may be affected in a
“hot zone" to another area of the country,
that has human rights issues attached to it.
because that’s called resettlement and m,
settlement has a history of populations who
may not want to go or whose rights may
be abused in the new area. There really aren't any standards [or
resettlement, so we'd have to create those.

What kind of policy changes and negotiations will have
to happen?

Well, climate change isn't a domestic issue It's a global is-
sue. So those working in Copenhagen want to realize some sort
of international agreement, but it’s moving very slowly. In terms
of the social implications of these policies, governments are of-
ten very domestically oriented in their policy, which is why we
don’t have an international migration agreement, So they tend
to see this as a “national security" issue. lfyou'rc a developed
nation and someones going across yourborder, it's a national
security issuct If you're a country that’s an ascending country,
then you view it as a survival stratc y, a coping mechanism.
Those are very different perspectives to enter into a dialogue

I can say that there has been more progress than I had
thought, The African Union agreement, {or exnmpk, has a
provision for these migrants, though it may just be limited to

environmental migration linked to conﬂict. In Europe, there’s
now a call by the parliamentarians to talk about this in the
convention on human rights. The United States may be the
furthest behind, because ‘we‘re not talking to Mexico about an
agreement, or the Caribbean countries, or any other countries
for that matter. It doesn’t mean we won’t. We are definitely

ing to be one of the countries that will be affected by that int
ternational agreement. No one knows how many people there
will be. It's just based on the number ofvulnerable populations.
They don't have any rights, and today there’s already 190 mile
lion environmental refugees.

In terms ofthc challenges in human rights more broadly,
what ways might these precedents sort
of effect a post climate-change era?
Which rights are under the most stress?

The right to food, the right to their
ter. the right to livelihoodilhese will be
things that the people affected by climate
change won't have caused, There will be
some additional marginal impact on cv-
cryone, and there may be discrimination
that happens when these migrants try to
move, because they're not protected when
they move from their homeland. That
raises other righ157tlie right to be free
from discrimination and a whole host of
other rights that the High Commissioner
at the United Nations, the secretary, just

came out with a report about, which details all the myriad
rights that will be affected by climate change.

He also called upon governments to take these rights into
consideration, to take them into consideration in their mitigat
tion policies, in their adaptation policies and take them into
consideration in what institutions are created to monitor health
and human life more generally, beyond Copenhagen, That
hasn't happened yet, but there is a call for that, and I think, as 1
said in my talk, that the problem remains that so many people
don’t know what's coming, and they see it as a far-away event,
as the next generation’s problem. It’s really our problem, and we
have to come to terms with it,

Is-therc any sort of precedent for this in the last so years?

Not .nnch, except for conﬂict and war. We have that prec-
edent, that people who are under abuse, and suffering from
crises, do tend to move. The mass movement though is a bit
uvcrplayed, because it’s not that everyonc‘s going to get up and
move at the same time.

What about places that seem to be developmentally
maxed out?

In the long run, you may not be able to do much In the
long run, if we don’t stop climate change, this' is going to be
irrelevant by 2100, there will be more problems than we can
imagine unless we ve done so much to address them. But along
the way, we can do a lot of things. If we help communities
adapt by helping them use conjunctive technology, which is
surface and groundwater management, we could go a long way
in many communities for maximizing the rain that they do get
in storage facilities. We've never put the kind oftimc and effort
into doing things like that because we like to build big projects,
where we hand the money over to some conglomerate and say
build a big project, build a big dam.

it seems like this will call for a more local, more mobile
development strategy, something like these new trends in
microﬁnanceandNGOs.

The innovations that are going to come along in the next
four or ﬁve years from people in these issues will be very help-
ful for governments as they try to implement these adaptation
plans, which right now are written very poorly, There’sjust no
understanding of how countries are going to grapple with these
issues. There's going to be a need for people to help in these
partnerships under each unique circumstance how to better
plan what to do to better prevent the worst impact, because
disaster really isn't about a huge storm, it's about this move-
ment of people. Herc' m the United States we can withstand
some, but even we have our threshold. There are a lot ofvulner—
able communities in the United States, and we 're not preparing
them for disaster at all.

If we could start thinking about climate change from a
humanrrights perspective, we would have to start having town
hall meetings, we'd have to start informing the public more
readily about the types ofproblems they might encounter, and
allowing communities to help prepare for the future, what re-
sources we need, and that involves a dialogue about economic
and social rights, which means we have to question where the
money in our country is being spent. We should have more of
a say in how the money in our country is being spent then we
do at the present moment, because we don’t. And a lot of this
is not so transparent. That all has to come out when you put
it through a human-rights lens, It means really getting people
more involved in the democratic process. So taking back our
democratic process is really the lll'Sl thing that needs in happen
in promoting human rights.
