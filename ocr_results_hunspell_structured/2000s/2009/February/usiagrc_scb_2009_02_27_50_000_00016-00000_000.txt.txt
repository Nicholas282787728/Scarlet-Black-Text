A major part ofour carbon foot-
print living on this campus is our en—
ergy consumption. Fromthe com-
puter that] am writing this on to the

'ghts in my room, we all use a sig-
niﬁcant amount of electricity. There
are a lot of basic, simple things you
can do. You can make (very simply)
your dorm room more environmen-

‘ tally friendly. This week’s column is
more of a list, so bear with me.

Tum off all lights when you aren’t
using them. This means room, closet
and even bathroom—provided that
there are not peo 1e still in it that
might be kind o awkward. ‘in not
saying that you need to never use
your lights or work in the dark (that
might mess your homework up).

Additionally, make sure the lights
in your room that you do have on are
compactﬂotescentones. Sometimes
people feel that these are too bright,
but I’ve never had a problem with
them and that also means less lights
being used (Note: If thev are too
bi ight be careful if)ou drape cloths
over El‘icmilt s a major ﬁre hazard.)
Better vet, if its a nice dav outside
open your curtains and use the natut
rnl light

Computers use an awful lot of
energy when onicven searching

0n keeping Jumuland dirty

Aldiough i an pleased that Cleveland will
not be sub-free next year, the fact that James has
been chosen as the sub-free dorm on South is,
well, really dumb. Do you really think sub-free
students will want to be living next to Cleveland
with ﬁre alarms going ottatz a.m.?With drunk-
on shrurdny night yells echoing ori’the enclosed
lnggia? With Gardner concerts and loud (lance
parties? Not to mention, South is always the ﬁrst
to go during room draw, nnd by Iclrloving one
dorm completely from the non sub-tree draw, it
will make it more difﬁcult for those who really
want to live on South to ﬁnd a room. This
had ' nation for sub—free students and Jami—
lundcn alike.

Saturday night burrito chase

\Vhile I love knowing about all the cool
things going on around campus and all the great
things SGA is doing for us, the new bathroom
reader stated that a new student organization
would be operating a hurrito stand on Saturday
night from 12-2. So inevitably during the Freree
February Birthday Bash many students set out
on n Search for these hypotherionl burritos. Pretty
soon rumors started circulating ilnd cvelvone
was asking when: these burritos could he. h'lnyhc
they to in Loose? I so: \ blue light inside Dibble
lounge Mm he tlicvrc a liluu light iril? No. In
the uutl than: were only hordes o ‘olifuscd and
intoxicated Grinnollihns, rill despen tly lacking
in burritos So next l'liuc son, please get your
burrito l’r‘Cl gl‘lt or else the next hurrittt riot
may and up in the JRC with u toppling otyour
regime.

An opinion about opinions

I would like to opine that there have been {at
too many opinion articles ﬁlling the pages of the
mess in recent weeks. Is there simply not enough
real news on our tiny campus to sustain a paper or'
usual length? Maybe someone should write a news
story discussing the lack ornews on campus.
