necessarily looking at,“Do 1 have the time for it, is this
necessarily something that 1 need robe involved with?"5or
Iguess rnymarn problem is being able to say no to things
and being able to delegate to other individuals.

As tar as overcoming ir,1 need to be more conscious
of delegation and the importance of delegation.

currently, I‘m a senator ror Clarrgrala.Tiris is my rust
semester, but I‘ve also been heavily involved in organiza-
tions as Sir as VOX and Con Brio. Also, in Grinncll
Singers,1've been secrecrry for the past year .. .1 consider
myself to be really, really good at the organizational part.
1 haven't had a hugc amount ofcxperience within SGA
here, but 1 have been a vocal member throughout the
whole Sheree Andrews thing, of criticisms within SGA
and within Houston and Travis,

I ﬁrst and foremost am a student advocate] antici-
pare my role to be someone there tor the students. I like
to say that I am a representative not of my constituents
but for my constituents. So, l'd like to ntansfcr the same
thing to, if I’m elected V'PSA, be there for the students
ﬁrst and then deal with the Student Affairs part I get
to let students know what's going on so there are less
mrscommunicatrons, more transparency, and more avail-

ability ormyselr

itworks. 1 have a copy ofthe bylaws and constitution in
my backpack rrght now Ive read them a couple ottimes.
its something that 1 m passionate about and lrn gorng
to bring fresh ideas to the table, deﬁnitely

I dont have the most direct experience with SGA, I
don't think that's the biggest weakness, I'm trying to turn
it around as a plus 1'm talking to people l'm going to
go into this knowing] don't have the most experience—aids
something 1 am working on.

Self-govemance isn'tjust words, it has to be actions,
It’s deﬁnitely actions taken by people. Everyone’s got a
dirrerent deﬁnition.Ir’s the actions orasking the neighbor
to turn the music down at midnight, putting bikes back
up on racks when they fall down. In geneml, it'sjustwe’re
adults, it’sjust living together peaceiirlly as adults.We don't
have to go cryrng to mom or dad it'sjust people living
peaceﬁrlly in a society,

V'PSA is the student advocate in the Student Affairs
ofﬁce. and i'm going to work with them, I’m not going
to ﬁght them, I’m going to work with [admrnisrnttors]
and have a good relationship with them to get students
what they want and what they neediI'm going to ﬁght
for that.

trying to completely redo whar we did, We rewrote
the constitution and tried to increase our presence on
campus and let people know what we were doing and
create more events and move back towards advocacy
rather than service.

I don’t have much experience with the particular
committees that VPSA sits on. I’m on the strident
Satcty and Security Committee but that's I think the
only VI’SA committee that I'm on. I have heard a lot
about what goes on in these committees because I'm
a senator and I hear about it every week and I think
[’11 be able to pick it up quickly and I have enough
experience with achieving goals and working on
projects that I think it Will be ﬁne.

I think it has a lot to do with taking responsi»
bility for your actions. We get a lot more freedom
here than other people do at other schools and it’s
important that we are accountable for what we do,
that we take rcsponsrbrlrty for our actions, and we
act in responsible ways, In that vein. I think it’s also
important that we kind ofassert our right to govern
ourselves and that we become active members ofour
community so that we will be treated wrth respect
and so that students can continue to have an active
say in whar goes on.

..,.,. “‘1’

1 have about ﬁve spe-
ciﬁc goals I've laid out that
I want to do. Generally, I
just want to put together
some practical things that
just wrll make sure that
students have [an] easier
time being students here,
And, like streamlining
technology and making
information more available
to students, educating new
professors about the atmosphere here on campus
and different programs available to their students,
so basicallyjust doing things, trying to alleviate the
hindrances that students have to be students.

I was a senator for two semesters. And as a
scnatot,1was a member of the student Curriculum
Committee. I was on the student Curriculum Come
mittcc as SEPC chair for both my majors, Physrcs
and German. And through the student Curriculum
Conimittec,I was appointed to the overall Curricue
lum Committee ofthe College, so that’s with faculty
and the registrar and the dean. And I have also been
a mentor and a mentce in the mentoring program

I want to work on the
accountability of the ad
rrrinistrators, and make sure
that students don’t feel torn
between the administration
and their faculty, I feel like
especiallyiniiselfsgovemancc
institution that is beyond
unacceptable, so that needs
to be the ﬁrst thing that
happens. My second goal
is to increase service learning

and ﬁnd other ways to get students into the classroom
other than Just sitting in die middle ofARH or Noyce.
My main goal is working my ass ortro make sure that
that [budget curs] don'r artect our learning. And 1 think
increasing class sizes by a little bit is acceptable and 1m
okay with that, httt there are certain litres I'm just not
okay with crossing.

In terms of SGA cxperience,1’ve been a senator for
two semesters up in CND. One of my goals was actually
workingtowards adnuruscratoraccountabrlrtyAlso,1have
saton a lot ofdifferent SGA committees, waltz chair this
semester, I've sat on ACE Committee, 5AA, SCC,
I've been involved in student Curriculum Committee,

The broad things are
making sure students feel
like their feedback is actually
taken seriously 1 ms abroad
last semester bur I kept up
with what was going on
[and] 1 think being away
sort of gives me an outside
view about what maybe we
can do better and to push (or
students views to actually be
taken seriously Beyond that

in terms ofthe spcciﬁcsI think as AA I'd work to get the
break reorganized so we’d Lrim dic fat ofiofwintcr break
and put it onto Thanksgivingl think that SEPCs need to
get reorganized in a fashion, Mostly it's the broad issues
of trust and then speciﬁc projects.

I have really diverse experience and what that means
is I’ve been a senator, I've sat on committees, I‘ve been on
JudCo for two years,l’m one of the two studentmembers
on the Committee of Academic Standing which Julie
got for us this semester, and I also am just active injusi
nonsstudent type things like GeTonch was in Debate,
Grinnell Singers, things like rhar.

and a tutor, so 1 feel like through the general SGA
committee system, SEPCs, and mentoring in the
classroom, I think I have a lot of experience. I’ve
basically been [current VPAA] Julie Hoye's shatiow
this semester and last semester.

Well 1 know from experience about my selfthat
when I commit to somethingi have a really hard
time saying ‘no.’1 knowI got really burnt out in high
school as student body president and 1 know the is»
sue thatwrll come up the most is taking on too much
and not being able to do everything well, so 1 think
in order to overcome that 1 need to set speciﬁc goals
and try not to overwork myselftoo much.

I have a hard rrme deﬁning sclfsgovernance rn
theoretical words so 1 think selfegovernance rs not
something you can put in a textbookiI think it's
something tharyou see in action Sotthink that us
having everyone really take care orthemselves and
take care of each other.

We're all students, we're all here primarily as
students. I think that academics should be ﬁrst in
our mrntls. 1 think in SGA—in general overarching
termsiwe are students. My role in terms otthe aca-
demics will be to tell people and really strive towards
what students need in their academic lives.

which VPAA actually hiB to chair, so I know how that
works, too.

one of my weaknesses especially this year is that a
lot otpeople are unhappy with the way SGA is working,
and so they want to make changes and so I think because
I’ve been involved with SGA in the past, 1 may not have
as much otan outside view as some people would like. It
I’m elected, I can kind ofwork to mold those two sides
oftlungs and improve it but also keep the working pans
that are actually effective.

Personally. selfegovcruancc for in: if it had to come
down to one word it would be u'ust. which I know is
really corny But 1 think that is rhe most basic element
otselt-governance because with self-governance 1 think-
the idea is you're supposed to be as honest wrrh people
as possible. so, 1 think trust probably is the number one
goal orselt-governance for me.

I think academic affairs needs more student govem—
ment involvement because I knowlulie Hoye has been
doing a fantastrejob getting students on academic cams
mrttees, but she only has one committee that now has pal”
manent student involvement.I thinkwe need to continue
to try and up that invohcment more because the main
reason we're here is for academics, and so I thinkwe have
a lot ofgteat input when it comes to student aerairs,

1 think that's important because that kind otgives me
many many, ditterent angles of kind oflooking at things
arid also makes me comfortable interacting with a lot
of different groups whether it he administrators, faculty,
students, anybody.

I think that I can get really caught up in one thing
like ifthere‘s one project that really is taking a lot of time
and energy I Will get stuck in it in terms of wanting to
get it to the end and I know student government is a
process in winch we try to do as much as possible on a
wide variety or projects and try really as hard as possible
to get them done

l've wrestled with [self-governance] myself while
on judCo and 1 think above everything else it has to do
with respect and respecting those around you, respecting
yourself, being able to communicate viably and being able
to communicate directly is something really imponant.

Ithink primarrly you have to be the students'advocate
in front or the faculty because they're the ones who are
cont-rolling,with exception ofthe scheduling issues which
rue also administntn‘ve, it really has to be pressing the race
ulty to be listening to the students' concerns. And i mean
I guess I am there to do that and push and represent.
