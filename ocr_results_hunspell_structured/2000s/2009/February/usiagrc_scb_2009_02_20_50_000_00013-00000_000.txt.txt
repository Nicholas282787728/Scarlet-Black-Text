Parliament: easier to rob than a convenience store

When we were little, my sister and I weie notori-
ous for our mischief. We weren’t desperate, like many
in these troubled friiaricial times arc,but simply .. . cu-
rious and maybe bored—but certainly not desperate.

One day, we decided we needed a ball. Didn't re-
aliy matter what color it was, or size, but if it didn’t
bounce, we would have none ofit.

And so, we hatched a plan, And by “we,"l of
course mean my sister, since women, evetr when
they're young, have that curious combination oi‘heing
devious and clever at the same time,

one bright al‘tetnoon,we innocently strolled into
Arthur Drug, the local convenience store, on a quick
errand for Aunt Jemima’s 135th birthday (yes, she's
still alive),We walked in innocent and happy, a youth
ful spring in our steps arid planned on walking out
masters of the world.

My sister, ever the leader, quickly spotted the best
bouncy ball in the store, stuffed it into her pocket, and
made for the exit, strolling beside our mother. Our
childhood would survivel We smelled fresh air, tasted
the sunlight on our cheeks and dreamt of hours of
bouncy bliss until the alarm went off, the manager
of the convenient store showed up and our mother
turned on us with malice in her eyes. suffice to say, we
were still sore days later and we were now personally
acquainted with the local police force

Why should I care? Well, to get back to evcryonc's
favorite topic (the tinancral crisis, of course), things
have changed a lrttlc since my sister and l were little.

You see, there's a bit eta tightening oftlte belts going
on these days, VVe’re in the middle of an economic
crisis the likes ofwhich
haven't been seen since
, well. Fidel Castro
wasn't even in charge
of Cuba back then, and it
he’s still around today.
Nevertheless, the crisis , .
rs real and serious, and people might acnraily not be
able to survive (unless they get as clever as my sister,
that is).

And that's just what one desperate Belgian did.
be tipped off our brilliant, s-year-old-logic-proof
plan. This copycat Belgian Lives in Brussels, the seat
of the European Parliament. The EU Parliament
building itself, remarkably, is quite similar to our old
convenience store, albeit on a kind or European scale
(except Parliament doesn't really sell anything useful,
like bouncy balls or do anything useful either, for
that matter).

out Belgian decided that ire needed a “personal
stimulus package," much like my sister and l decide
ed we needed a bouncy bail, and that the EU pres
seated him with quite the opportunity for proﬁt in
these tro'uhled economic times, The Europeans want
a stimulus package too, you know. In he went, like my
sister and I, ﬁlled with dreams of riches, pliindel and
enough cash to buy truckloads ofbouncy bails .. . our
brave Belgian robber simply walked into the Europe-

an Parliament building and stuffed 50,000 Euros into
a bag, I guess he did it in a slightly classicr manner
than my sister and l, using
a bag and all, but to be fair,
out bouncy ball was slightly
more compact than 50,000
Euros. Then again, it's a lite
tle bit more impressive to try
and rob the European Parr
liament than the Arthur Drug Store in Connecticut,

Now, you might expect the security at the EU Parr
liamcnt building to be a little more intense than that
of the convenience store my sister and I attempted
to robtWell, you'd be wrong. Not only did the robber
grab 50,000 Euros but he got away scottftee (thanks
to our glorious example, clearly) with his money and
has not been caught since.

In these desperate times, it was quite heartening
to see some resourceful individuals are still out there,
doing their best to keep old traditions around, like my
sister and 1 back in the day.

EU citizens everywhere, however, were in uproar
over this blatant repeat event~ although, it’s a fair
bet they weren’t upset the man got away with all that
money, only that they didn’t think of extracting this
more “personal" kind ofstrmulus package sooner. Too
bad America keeps its money in Fort Knox and not
at Congress; otherwise, id be calling my sister right
about now,

And, for the record, we never did gct that ball.

Diversity at Grinnell: the great admissions myth

Williams, Colgate, Hamiltoniiiamcs that of i
invoke a resounding gag around licrciiiccd to be to
considered. To us. these '
“peer institutions" reek
of a putrid, Greekrsysr
temtpervaded culture
dominated by rich white
kids with fat trust funds.
In contrast, Grinnell,
our pastoral haven in
the heart of the salt-of-the-eartli Midwest, has long
remained a sanctuary for diversity and inclusio i.

The administration has appropriated this image,
constantly reminding us or our moral high ground
with bogus symbols like the green ribbons the gradur
ating class wore last year at commencement, which
supposedly signiﬁed our intention to retain Grinnell’s
socially conscious character in oui postgraduate lives.
The students, myself included, have also done their
shale in perpetuating this mirage, as we often believe
it, buy into it and regurgitate it to each other and to
our friends outside ofGiinnell.

This is wiry many or my friends were surprised
when I showed them a 2003 study published in TIM
fum'milfm‘ Brat/rt in Hi'g/Jrr Education. After employ-
ing "13 widely accepted quantitative measures of
institutional racial integration," the study identiﬁed
Grinneil as the worst elite small college in the country
for blacks,well behind Hamilton and Colgate and all
those other Phaethons.

Certainly, one would think that the College has
changed since 2003. After all, the arrival of the venett
able Posse program has dramatically enhanced diver
sity. But here’s the disturbing news: if we didn’t have
Posse, which consists of several students for whom
tuition is paid, we’d have almost exactly [be mm! per-

CCnmgC of Air anrAinencan f' years now as we
did in ihe '017’02 school year This means that the
admissions office has made
no progress whatsoever in
recrurtrrigblack students on
its own since 2002, a year
before the country's lcatlr
lug academic journal for
minorities in higher educa-
tion gave us their lasttplace
distinction. And we wore green iibboris for that?

Another fBHE ai-ticle reported that the average
admissions rate foi'blaclts between 1995 and 2004 was
only 43.4 percent at Grinnell, lower than our overall
average during that period, 50.4 percent. This is an
extraordinarily bizarre statistic, since most schools ads
mit black applicants at a higher rate.

Grinnell's lack of diversity extends to socioecot
noniic class as well. Perhaps most disconcerting is a
third snrdy by the join-rial examining the presence of
low-income snidents on campuses in 2007, Grinneli

Our percentage of Pell Grant recipients plummeted
between 1993 and 2007, a timeframe when our en-
dowment mushroomed, This is particularly embar»
rassing given the fact that our endowment in 2007
dwarfed those of places like Scripps, Oberlin and
Mount Holyoke. each ofwliich sat comfortably ahead
of Grinnell in the study.

The administration may very well throw the worn
Mark Twain quote about statistics at me, but the
fact of the matter is that they maintain a completet
ly masturbatory conceptualization of Grinnell, the
green ribbons serving as the most glaring evrdence of
this. We’d be wise to take a hint from Iowa’s U.S.
senator, Charles Grassley Even though Grassley is

a member of the most vilified, marginalized group
of Voldemoits at Gl‘lllllellitllt Republicans—he's
had some excellent ideas about higher education.
Grasslcy questioned whether exceedingly wealthy
colleges, such as Harvard, really deserve tax-exempt
non-profit status because they spend so little orthcit
treasure chests and when they do it's on lavish builds
rugs and cosmetics, not snidents.

Tins is not the way a nei‘rpi'oﬁt organization
should function, Grassiey argued. He stated that if
rich colleges don’t start spending a lot more money
on students, he’d pursue legislation to have their
taxexempt status repealed. Though they won't say
it overtly, Harvard introduced a sweeping overhaul
oftheir budget in response to Grassley's threats, der
voting substantially more resources to financial aid.
Soon, other colleges followed suit

I’d encourage our new Dean of Admission, Seth
Allen, to begin aggressively recruiting more lowrinr
come students, underrepresented minority students,
and snidents from military families, before he faces
public criticism from academic journals, oi worse, a
powerful U.St Senator. It’s too early to tell whether
Allen represents the perverted corporate culture of
the recent past, or whether he will make an earnest
effort to help rescue our ravaged Mission Statement.

The marginal improvement in Latino enroll-
ees this year is a good sign, but it doesn't offset the
data on Pell Grants, blacks, and the fact that only 30
percent of applicants were offered financial aid this
year, a startling divergence from years past. Enrollr
ing more lo\v1neome students in a time of economic
peril would enable Allen to exhibit his professional
talent and consequently transform him into a revered
figure on campus. But in effect, he’s done absolutely
nothing about this so far, Just look at the statistics.
