Nah: Dame Things were ﬁnally looking up in South Bend after

with a very impressive win over Oklahoma, but were subsequently
pounded by Florida State. While they’re still better than most of
their Mountain West compendon, the Cougars will not he playing
in a BCS bowl this winter.
Georgia TM): say what you want about the tenets of the triplce
option offense, but at least it’s an ethos. However, that ethos failed
to the extreme against Miami, churning out only 95 yards on the
ground from 35 carries.
Urn/e Though Oregon is bouncing back nicely after facing a lot of
early adversity, last week’s loss to the Ducks proved that the Utes
arertr the force they were last year. Utah still plays in a fairly tough
conference, too, so expect them to rake their share oflumps this scat
son.
