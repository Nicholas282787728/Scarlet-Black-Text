gain perspective on RLCs' roles on campus.

"PJ. has helped me immensely with dur
ties. He was able to help me keep inventory
of dorm supplies before school started, and
has also helped me distrubutc keys on movee
in day-and has even helped me with manag—
ing trunk rooms in Clangrala," Lau said. “So
far, I feel that it has worked well, and will
continue to do so"

Smith and Younker hulls (Smounker)
also have experienced consolidation. The
new RLC, Michael Hunt, also serves as the
Lilly Religious Life intern tor the Center
for the Center for Rel' io, Spirituality and
Social Justice. “His pos on as a Lilly Intern
should enhance his leadership,” Greene said.
“He would be able to do a lot more count
seling than the traditional RLC, due to his
pastoral backtound." The Lilly Program at
Grinnell is funded by a grant to encourage
discussion of religion and ethics on campus.

The other new RLC’s are Rachel Wike,

Loosehead and Eric Vos,]amaland.

The selection of the new RLC’s took
place in May, when a number of students
assisted Houston Dougherty and Greene
in the selection or this year's RLC's. "We
recruited applicants who went to prestis
gious liberal arts schools just like Grinnell,"
Greene said "We feel that they would fit in
and appreciate the campus a lot more,which
of course, beneﬁts the students.”

The future of the residential life struc-
ture remains uncertain. “It depends on the
ﬁnancial situation ofthe college. Personally,
I think it's best that we fully employ all the
positions that we lost last year. However, the
ﬁnancial situation this year is not the same
as in previous years," Conner said,

Greene echoed Conner’s sentiment that
things are still ﬂexible for years to come.
“This year will give us time to see how the
plan works. There's no guarantee that this
will be the layout for next year," Greene said,
