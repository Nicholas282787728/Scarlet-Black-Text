New StIident OrIentation: A surprisingly great success

Share your opinions with us

’ Every week, as the editors of the SScB,
we gather Io discuss Issues on campusI We
_, debate and ultimately come to a consensus
that represents our views as a group. The
product of these conversan'ons is what you
‘ are reading right now—the staff editorial.
However, we represent the views of only
a small group of students. We attempt to
‘bring awide perspective that represenrs the
‘_ broad campus spectrum not only through
I our staff editorials, but also throught sec-
tion of the paper. But without the collective
voices of the community, the paper cannot
‘ fully embody the essence of GrInnell That
, is why we encourage you, the reader, to make
your voice heard iiuough Letters to die edi-
tor, comments on \vww.thesandb com and
_ random rants and raves. -
The campus newspaper can serve as an
active forum for open discourse amongst
students, faculty, administration and re
dents of Grinnell. Lastyear, the Opinion
Fsection-saw its fair share of discussion’rhat
helped raise awareness and open dIalogIIc

on several Issues across campus We encour-
age vou to keep the discussion going in two
directions—write us, and do not hesitate to
complaIn. Let your voIcc be heard.

Great improvements in N56

The organizers of New Student Orienta-
tion should be commended for ajob well done.
This year’s NSO came and went without a sine
glc alcoholsrelated hospitalization. This time
last year, no fewer than 11 students were sent
to Grinnell Regional Medical Center. While
this year’s nonexistent hospitalization statistics
are the‘most tangible evidence of the week’s
success, NSO experienced a number of small
victories due' In large part to the collaborative
efforts of Student Affairs,p aid NSO interns,
NSO leaders and Student Staff. It‘ s about
time.

Andrea conner, Assistant Dean of Star
dents and Director of Residence Life and Ori-
entation, along with paid interns Alex Peitz'lO
and Hugh Redford ’10, led the revolution in
rebIIIldIng Nso from-Ilse ground up, Bring-
ing NSO graduates to the planning table was a

strategic move on the part of Student Affairs.
Having upetientcd ﬁrsthand the program
ming of prchous NSOs, Peirz and Redford
were able to strengthen sessions that may have
fallen short in the past as well as reinvent those
that had been complete failures.

The alcohol,
sexual health and
diversity program-
ming were among
the, most drastically
altered as well as the
most wellsattended
sessions of the week.

Instead of hIrIng

an outside group to

handle some of the

more sensitive discussions, NSO coordinators
looked to students to facilitate the bulk of the
programmIng, a move that added a level of rel—
evance to program.

In response to the record semng antics of
last years orientation week and the 29 alco-
hol related hospitalizations that accumulated
during the 2008- 09 school year, an Alcohol
Task Force compnsed of students and fac-

ulty In conjunction with Student Affairs

implemented a “harm reducnon" approach

to alcohol educItIon on campus. TlIIs

new strategy was intmduced to the wider

campus community during Student Staff

training and vlms then properly launched at
the beginning of
N50 through'a
series of clusters
wide conversa-
tions facilitated
by members of
Student Staff.
The result seems,
so far, to be a sues
cess.

While absci~
hence-only alcohol education has never
been the Intention of N50 programmIng,
organizers of N30 have been unable to
adequately verse incoming students on the'
Importance of responsible alcohol con-
sumption until thisyearTbe new approach
to alcohol education" Is long awaited and
we hope it will be constructive to the cam»
pus community throughour the year.

A welcoming message from SGA

On behalf of the entire SGA cabinet,
welcome back. We return (or, in the case
of the class of 2013, arrive) to old and new
friends, gorgeous (if ﬂeeting) weather and a
campus abuzz with rhe start of a new year.
We also find a communIIy In the mIdst of
selfsdoubt and proud protection oftraditlon,
ofenduring values and broken assumptIons.
LoomIng over an already challengIng tIme
of transition is the search for the next presi—
dent of Grinnell College, a decision that
will undoubtedly deﬁne the dlrcction of our
community for thc ncxr dccach

We are challenged to defend what
Grinncll means to us and, much more difv
flcultly, to describe what it Is that must be
done to preserve it. Forty-two years ago on
this very campus, Martin Luther King Jr.
gave no sermon, “Remaining Awakc Durr
Ing a RevolutIon." student lcadershIp and
cngagcmcnr 'Is crucial at thIs tIme.The voice
of the student body cannot be heard unless
it is spoken, so stand up and get to it. Go
to forums and info sessions, petition your
student government, speak to your profes-
sors and administrators, Do not let history
pass you by.

That said, do not let yourself be deluded.
A new prcsIdcnt will not swoop In and imr
mchatcly rcmcdy all of Grinncll’s troubles,
