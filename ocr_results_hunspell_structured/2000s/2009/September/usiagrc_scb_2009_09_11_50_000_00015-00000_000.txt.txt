Tennis team
expeﬁences
early success

By DARWIN MANNING

The Grinnell Women's tennis team is
now 5-0 fot the season, with the victories
on Saturday against Simpson College (7-2)
and Graceland College (63) and on Sunday
versus Cornell college (54).

The continually closer scores, while all
winners, reflect the fatigue that affected the
players as the weekend wore on. Artci- two
tiring matches on Saturday, the team was
hitting the wall against Cornell.

“We had a difficult time with our singles
matches, something we usually handle pretty
well and i think that was mainly due to lack
of footwork and energy," Elizabeth Spears
’11 said. “So we really had to push ourselves
through a very uncomfortable match to
make points happen and, ultimately, win."

Although the Pioneers were exhausted
by the end of the weekend, they continued
to Win with the help ofa strong conditions
ing program, which has been a major area
of focus for the team. Starting this season
Head coach Andy Hamdton has imple-
mented a mandatory strengthsconditioning
regimen that is much more rigorous than in
previous years.

“It's deﬁnitely going to he hard in the
beginning of the season to adjust, but later
on when we start to see results we will be
thankful that Coach Hamilton decided to
implement this new mandatory training,"
Jill Akiwma ’12 said.

Besides a stronger dedication to the
physical part of the game, Hamilton wants
players more attuned to the mental part of
it as well.

“This includes being smart about each
loss and deciding if the main mistakes made
were in the technical, physical or mental
part or the game,” said Hamilton.

However, conﬁdence is running high, es-
pecially considering the success oflnst year’s
team, which went 20-7 and undefeated in
conference play.

“If players play at their highest level we
should ﬁnd success as a team, because my
assessment is that we have a veiy talented
team," said Hamilton.

Last year was also the fifth year in a row
that the Pioneers won the Midwest Confer-
ence championship.

“Going to Conference is what I'm most
excited and nervous about because I really
want to win it," Kelsey Pickens '10 said. “I
am going to have to work really hard to hold
up that tradition."

A little luck might not hurt either in go,
ing to the post-season this year.

“Last year did not work out ‘cause we
played the University of Chicago, the fourth
best team in the nation, in the second round
[of nationalsJ," said Akiyama. “Depending
on how our luck pans out this year, we’ll
hopefully get a nice string of luck in the
teams we match up against in the NCAA
tournament."

But right now they will have to take it
week by week. With five wins under their belt,
the team now practices in anticipation and
full of conﬁdence going into their first home
matches this weekend. Both matches will be
on Saturday, Sep. 12, the first against Knox
College at 10 am. and the second versus Uni-
versity ofWisconsinsStevcns Point at 4 p.m.

Mac Field invaded as ultimate
team prepares for new season

As Elephantitis draws closer, players pull together for team, each other

By LIANA ElsMAN

The Grinnell Ultimate teams begin a
new campaign this year, building off the
success oflast year and a new crop of first
years.

Although it is a club sport, the Ultis
mate Frisbee team at Grinnell maintains
a level of organization and commitment
that is comparable to that of established
varsity teams.

“We practice just as hard as the Var-
sity teams that I was on in high school,"
Cory Kcelcr ’12 said. “We have the same
practice formatiwe
stretch, we do drills
and we have a rou-
tine that we get into.
we practice probably
for like eight hours a
week and then when
you include running or
sprinting workouts it's
prohahly around ten
hours a week."

The women's team,
the StickysTonguecl
Frogs, and the men's
team, the Grinnellephants, practice to—
gether in order to prepare for their sues
ccss at seasonal games and the various
tournaments that they attend on an an—
nual basis.

“We go to like five or six [tourna—
ments] in the fall," Keeler said. “Then
in the spring we don’t go to as many but
they are more serious. The spring is our
competitive season."

The first tournament of the fall sea-~

son, Elephantitis, will be held on Grins

”lhe ream has taken a turn m-
wards a more goal and wlnson's
entered season. We are looking [0
wln a lot more games and in the
spring when we have the (allege
SEIlES, We hope to getfarlher than
we ever have before.”

Captain Ben Finkelstein ’10

nell’s own Mac Field on sep. 19. Be-
cause it's the only home tournament in
the fall for the teams, both the Stickies
and the Grinnellcphants split themselves
into two squads, effectively entering four
teams into the tournament, The seventh
annual Elephantitis tournament will fca»
tute 14 open college teams and 10 wom-
en’s college teams, including several state
universities such as Missouri. Iowa, Iowa
State and Kansas State.

“The team has taken a turn towards
a more goal and winsoricntated season,"
captain Ben Finkel-
stein Y10 said. “We are
looking to win a lot
more games and in
the spring when we
havc the college series
we hope to get farther
than we ever have her
fore.”

Last year, the
Grinnellcphants
placed fifth at a
tournament that is
equivalent to Divi-
sion III National Championship for var
sity sports. They also received the Spirit
award for best sportsmanship. However,
any pressure the players feel to repeat the
success of last year is completely their
own.

“In terms of formal intensity it does
not compare to varsity sports,” Finkel-
stein said. “It is a lot more of a personal
intensity, more of a familial intensity
where you want to do well because every-
one else on the team wants you to."

Despite this commitment to their
sport and to one another, the Ultimate
Frisbee team still faces skepticism and
frequently finds the need to defend their
status as a legitimate sport on campus.

"We are not treated like a sport in
the way that other sports are and that is
frustrating,” said chler. “I wish that we
could have some of the amenities that
other sport reams enjoy. The [Ultimate]
players are paying for travel, paying for
jerseys and paying for all of the sturfthat
you get for free on varsity teams".

Although there are disadvantages to
not being a varsity sport, the Ultimate
Frisbee team does not necessarily want
to attain this distinction. Without the
pressures and the restrictions of being a
varsity sport, the Ultimate team is able to
foster a more relaxed and accepting spirit
among their team members.

“It is a time when evetyhody can pair
ticipate because no one has said that you
are out starters or you are on the B team
because it is only three weeks into the
season," Kceler said.“1fpeop1c are look—
ing for exercise or are interested in pick-
ing up a sport that is less ofa time mm,
mitmcnt than a varsity sport, they should
come out!"

It is with this attitude in mind and a
disc in hand that the Ultimate team hopes
to gain the same respect and recognition
that is given to other sports teams on
campus, without sacriﬁcing their spirit of
cooperation and love of the game.
