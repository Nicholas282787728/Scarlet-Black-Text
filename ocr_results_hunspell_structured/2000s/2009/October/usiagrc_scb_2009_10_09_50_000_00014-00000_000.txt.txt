Quarterback problems? Get another one

After struggling early, the Fighting Illini ditched their starter despite having two quarterbacks that could split the job

Let me begin this wock by expressing my Sincerc condo-
lences to rhc many disappointed Chicagoans who had been so
hopeful about their chance to host the 2016 Summer Olyl‘n‘
pits. Their hopes were dashed by European antipathy towards
American hegemony (who can blame them?) and a dcsirc. it
seems to me, for evcryonc to get to go to the beach, Maybe
2020, guys,

For this week's column, I'm changing up my style a little
int, and will be discussing, rather than obtuse prognostications
based upon minimal expertise about teams you don't carc about
from parts ofthe country that you're not, something interesting.
I bring you, this week, talk about teams from the same region
as Iowa, the Lovely and
Sunny Midwest! And
with that winsomc sales
pitch, we're om

In other disappoint»
ing Illinois news, it's also
been a terrible few weeks
for Ron Zook’s Unlvcr-
sity of Illinois football
team. The Fighting Illini
arc now 13, with their
lone win coming against ch competition, the fearsome Red-
birds of Illinois State. The Redbirds, by the way, are currently
outpacing their big brother with a H record. 50 now Coach
look, who has always been ragged on for recruiting better
than he coaches,is benching quarterback and former blue chip
recruit Juice Williams for three-year back-up Eddie McGee.
Juice Williams is capable of running and passing successfully,
but in an offcnsc where h: is the sol: focal point (due to the ab
sence of injured reczivcr Arrclious Benn), he's in over his head,
Fraysstyle.

The University of Michigan Wolverines have found a so-
lution to their quarterback problem. The Wolverines just lost
their ﬁrst true road gam: to in-strite rival Michigan State, and
sonic ofthc blame for that loss can be placed on true freshman
quarterback Tate Forcier. Forciers mistake, a key overtime in-
terception, was one of youth and inexperience, not lack ofskill.
The Wolverines wouldn't have been competitive without his
223 passing yards and two touchdown passes, he's also been key
to their previous success this season, especially with his clutch
play against Notrc Dainc.

In fact, Forcicr has been stellar all season, throwing for 894
yards and nine touchdowns with only three interceptions. His

quarterback rating is an implcsswc 142.69—rhe guy is like a Bis
zzamJUice VVillidms! The reason he's succeeding andJiiicc isu'l
remains as obscured as the catacombs Ron Zook \\'lll be sent
to at the end orrhis season. we can start by looking it Michis
gan Coach Rich Rodriguess decision to utilizc multiple qunr
terbacks to mitigate the pressures of thc job. Williams would
clcarly bcnefit from a scheme that would lessen his responsibil-
ity to pass the bull, Michigan has devised the perfect tactic for
this scenario. and it’s one that Illinois would do well to copy
Talc Forciei can iun all right, but the competition is worried
about his passing, as his numbers indicate they should,

When Rodriguez wanrs reams to have to worry about his

quarterback scrambling,
he'll put in another tru:
freshman, Denard Robs
inson,who is more skilled
at running, but can also
throw the ball a little.
Robinson is a lesser Juice
Williams, and though
Forcier is obviously bets
ter than Mchc, Zook
obviously feels conﬁdent
starting him. It seems to me that Illinois could have a lot of
success switching off quarterbacks depending on the situation
rather than overburdeningjust one.

Ifanyonc doubts that switching quarterbacks can bring sucs
ccss, look at the 2007 BCS National Championship, in which
Florida, using a combination of scrambler Tim chow and
pocketepasser Chris Leak, stomped Ohio State. The Buckeyes
only used one quarterback, Heisman-winner Troy smith. smith
threw 30 touchdowns that year but only rushed for one, but
against an elite dcfcnsc like Florida's, OSU'S onerdimensional
offense wilted, only putting up 14 points. The NFL provides
further evidence that two is better than one with the popularity
of the Wildcat offensc, which beneﬁts tremendously from haVs
ing a second quarterback who is a mostly a run throat, but can
also Complerc a pass. Pat White of the Dolphins and Michael
Vick orthe Eagles both earned spots on their respective teams
because of the dissemination of the Wildcat offense. Troy
Smith now plays sparingly in the Wildcat for the Ravens, a
likely prediction otJuice's future. so, my advice to teams struge
gling with quarterback playrgct another one Using tandem
signal-callers might be as much ofa fad as that odd moment in
the '90s when swing made a comeback, but hey, Cherry Poppin'

Daddies still sold over a million CDPlES onoor Suit Riot.
Wollcnough ormyblathciing. Hcrc, wuh almost no analy
sis, are my forecasts:

Lux

Lsu:Tigcrs proved rhcmsclvcs with a big win at Georgia after
taking some boat for being overrated,

Miami: ’Cnncs got a huge win last week over Oklahoma after
stumbling against Virginia Tech.

Virginia Tech: Hokies beat Miami and Duke. have only one
loss, and look like the probabl: ACC champt

Alabama: Tidc keeps on rolling, but face some stirr compe-
tition in Ole Miss on the road, However, vaan Snead hasn’t
looked himsclf this season, and I predict 'Bama’s defensc will
pick him offat lcasr twice en route to a big win.

Usc: The Trojans looked strong against Cal last week and race
littlc opposition on the path to another Pacslo Championship.
Sperm! Anutbrmilzif, Purlibly Embarram‘rlg Pith—Missouri:
While I don’t yet know this, I feel deep in my bones that Miz-
Zen is going to crush Nebraska this Thursday night and posi-
tion themselves for a third straight Big 12 North Champions
ship. Go Tigers!

Sell

California: Jahvid Best and the Golden Bears have now taken
two lop-sided losses to conference foes. Emerald Bowl, here
we come!

Florida State: Seminoles seem to be suffering from Dissocias
rive Identity Disorder after losing to Boston College, and some
football prognosticators seem to feel Bobby Bowden has lost
his touch.

Houston2To make any real noise in the post-season, the cou-
gars needed to win out. They failed to do that, losing by 17
points to UTEP last Saturday

Games of the Week: There are a couple big conference games
this week that will have a major impact on bowl season. Florida
at LSU is a matchup between two very hot teams right now
and will go :1 long way tomirds determining who will win the
SEC and thus go to the BCS National Championship. IfTim
Tebow is healthy, the smart money is on the Gators.
Michigan faces off against Iowa at Kinnick stadium in another
intriguing matchup, The Wolverines are good, but Iowa's dee
fense has been pretty dominant this season. If they can stop the
run. I predict a big win for the Hawkeyes.

BY CHLOE MORYL

The Grinnell College Men’s cross Country
Team, commonly known as the Purple Roos,

placed fourth overall at the Brissman/Ltmdeen
Invitational Sch 2b in Davenport, IA,

The invitational yielded close res
stilts, with Dan Krauss ’12 ﬁnishing
12th out of almost 400 niniiets in a
time of 2553.5 With Davrd Montgom-
ery ’10 barely behind, ﬁnishing 13th in ,
25:54.8. Other notable pcrformnnccs
included Noah Dclong ’11 (20th). Alex
Reich '11 (53rd), Sliyam Dcshpandc 'll ‘
(57th). Chris Wilson '11 (62nd) and Gmnt
Rccd ’13 (73rd).

Though it’s midseason, a time when in Lh:
past, many runners have been injured, the R005
arc staying healthy, running fast and hoping to
solidify the gaps bctwccn the top live runners to
create an unstoppable force.

“Everyone who started the season healthy has
remained healthy,” Davis said. “Sam Calish [’10]
had a really bad anklc inJury and he's looking to
come back soon."

Sincc iniury hasn't been a problem, the Rnos
rue instead foulscd on tightening thc gip beavetn

there it'll be good."

Klaus, put ol' the luprllucc pack, said that
the gap boon-on those two groups could be closcd

largely through tmlnlng strategies.

“[In] the workouts we [did last Tuesday]

normally you have your time mat you're trying to

hit but [Tuesday we did] three minutes hard and

two recovery and the as were just trying

_ to stay up there with the top three," Krattss

said. “It’s about bieaking that mental

barrier and thinking ‘Okay,l was up

with them in that workout, I know

I can be up there with them [in the

race]'."

Whilc practice helps the ﬁght to close

the 475 gap, it also allows Krduss to play off

Montgomery this week's Midwest Confer—

ence Performer of the Week, and intensify
their practices.

“It's good {or me to have a staining partner.“
Montgomery said, “Wt: both push oath other in
workouts and I think we're running much better
because of each other,"

According to his ninneis, Head Coach Will
Freeman is optimistic about the scnson, and espe-
cially for the \Nisconsin-Oshkosh Brooks Invita-
tinnal, which takes place in Oshkosh, Wisc, on
Oct 17.
