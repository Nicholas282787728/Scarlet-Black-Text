self-governing community.

One ofthe common misconceptions
about seltlgovernance is that you can do
what you want, when you want, regardless
orstatc and federal policies. In reality, those
rules mrrst be remembered and respected
despite the flex: rlity selegoveniance allows
our community.

Manydiscussions about seLf-govemance
revolve around the campus' alcohol policy.

interesting discussion.

The College has some discretion on

incidents. “If an RLC sees a

Osgood said. He added that the

Regardless of the ﬂexibility that sclfs
governance allows, laws still exist for the
college and state; “The law understands that
there rs some discretion especially when no
one is in danger," Osgood said. Our come
munity decisions must be mindful of laws,
Thus, making the. legaliry ofself-govemanc:
is cmemely complex and situational.

discretion when an offense rs minor and no
threat to public Safety.

Not everything iirncriorrs in terms of
legality, but instead, in terms of safety. An
example is \veapons.The College is liable for
allowing someone to hare a weapon and if
someone gets hurt. The college has obligde
tions that rest on top ofself-govcrnrtnchik:
banning weapons. Still, when anyone. stur
dent or stair, spots a dangerously ineoriated
person they have at least a moral obligation
to step in, no matter their age, and offer help,
but not to “report" them. “We live within a
lot otgray," Doughai-ty said.

Self- governance is surely not dying, but
there is often concern that self-govemancc is
somehow withering awrly,“No one is trying
to snatch away authority from students, it is
simply not true though there seems to he a
lot ofparanon, Osgood said The thought
ofthe college regulating your story decision
is simply not feasible I think that college' rs
a time ofindcpendcncc."

"Over the years 1 have seen self-gover-
nance less emphasized than it used to be
from student to student,"SGA Films Chair
Jeff Sinick ’09 said. “Upperclassmen used
to prescnt and us: Llie philosophy of self-
governance to new students. It

focus our attention on ﬁnding candidates
that help foster sclfegovernariee and helping
them risualize how a self governing come
rnurrity works, Douglrarty said We then
get candidates like Andrea Conner from
Bard College who was drawn to Grinnell
because ofselfegm'etnance,"

Dougharty said snidcnts who believe
self-governance is dying should get more
involved in SGA committees, to apply to
become an SA. and in general take advirne
rage ofoppornmides on campus to have your
voice heard and to promote self-govcmancc.

“Selfvgovetnance is not dead. Selfe
governance is always changing,

 

used to be more pressing then it
is now, but some of it has to do
with the College transitioning
and less institutional memory.”

Despite the changes and
evolution or selfegovetnance,

A student committee has updated
the Gr'innellVVik'r with a guide on selfv
governance, which is more a structurc than
a series of guidelines about selfegovernoncer
The handbook was written in order to ad-
dress lick of information, and to empower
students to use selfegovernancc.

Work is untlenirriy on providing more
selfegovernance information to incoming
students during New Student Orientation.
“We are working on doing a better job to
help students understand sclegovemance,"
Douglurry said.

“This common misconception
that selﬂgovemancc is dead is dcsttuctiie.
“That is why we need to provide education

system based on trust,"

to it, SAs are there for when self-governance
ultimately breaks down. there are times that
there needs to be a mediator because of
perceived authority someone might listen to

son said. “It‘s a big pririiege that we get to
deﬁne our own community here at Grinnell
and that involves active engagement from
everyone for that to work."
