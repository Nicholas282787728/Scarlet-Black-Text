Edgy students enact Rent

BY DARWIN MANNlNG

Grinncll’s Independent Musical Productions (GIMP) is
opening this season in high fashion by producing the Broadway
sensation “RENT."A story often avoided on conservative col-
lege campuses due to its controversial content, “RENT” will be
shown in Bucksbaum on Nov. 13 and 14 at 7 pm. and the Nov.
15 at 2 pm,

Deborah Berk'12, the director of GIMP, arrived at the deci»
sion to show “RENT" this fall with the help of her mother this
past summer.

“People don’t put on “REN " that often because it has a
lot ofhomosexuality, AIDS and young people dying. I thought
Grinnell would be perfect, because [sexual diversity] is ems
braced," Berk said.

While all the perrorrners, from the eight actors to the ten
singers are equally capable, their familiarity with the play is even
more impressive. “I enjoyed the movie and thought I was never
going to be able to see me musical~l thought it would be fun
[to be in],"said actor Konnor Clark'll.

Enthusiasm for the production is central both to Berk and
the cast. "For me passion is eighty percent of the performance. [I
looked for] People who really wanted to be in ‘RENT'..."Berk
said.

One of Berks most important roles as director of GIMP is
organizing the auditioning process. “I was looking for strong vo-
calists [who had] familiarity with the show," Berk said.“We were
working on a very tight time frame and since ninety percent of
the show was sung,I quite frankly didn‘t have the time or inclina-
tion to teach people the songs fiom scmtch.”

The musical pieces in “RENT" are essential in conveying the
issues it tackles through the struggles and successes ofeach char
acter. “I love the music and the chance to perform it was what
really made me want to audition,” said Peter Edberg '11,

Edbetg Will have plenty ofopportunity. one ochrk's philosr
ophies in directing is to "go big or go home," and to not “pussy
foot around," she said. According to Berk, a certain bravery is
essential as “RENT" has relatively challenging songs and covr
ers many issues and tense moments that can be difﬁcult to fully
capture.

“I hope that this show will have people talking more about
GIMP. . .1 want GIMP to become a really active part ofthe the-
ater department," Berk said,

Beyond the goals for GIMP as a whole, Berk also stressed the
iconic nanrre of the production. “I want the performers to drink
back on this performance proudly and say I was Roger or 1 was
Angel," Berk said.

After experiencing phenomenal success on Broadway and
gaining popularity across the United States, the musical "Wick-
cd" is now touring the nation ligmrIitl‘llS time stopping in Des
Moiii .

“\ iclted" tells the story the Wicked Witch of the West,
formerly known as Eiphrba, ofthe famous frim,The Wizard of
Oz. The story moves from Biphhba’ ourncy through a dirlicult
—— childhood as the

. _ Elphaba struggles
with a strange and
uncontrollable sense ofpower until one ofher teachers notices this
power and judges it to be a gift, The teacher tells Elphaba that
she will arrange a meeting with the famed Wizard of 02, so that
Elphaba can learn to use her power for good. The prospect other
ing considered ‘good,' something she has never experienced, ﬁlls
Elphaba with immeasurable joy. However, things don't go quite
the way she had envisioned them and, in time, Elphaba comes to
be known—dimugh no vice of her ownﬂs the Wicked Witch
of the West.

The original Broadway cast included ldina Menzel, who
played the role of Maureen Johnson in the ﬁlm version or Rent,
along widr a number ofother highly respected performers. While
perhaps not quite as star-studded. the touring cast did a wonder-
ful job of drawing in the viewers and the musical’s basis in the
story of the Wizard ofOz provided common ground for nearly all
audience members Along with telling Elphaba’s story, “Wicked"
also gave numerous insights into the Wizard of Oz as we know
it. The audience learned how the Tin Man becaine tin, where the
ruby slippers came from and just how Glinda became the ‘Good
Witch.’ Hailing never seen “Wicked” before,I was amazed at the
depth of the performance, I was incredibly moved by the musi»
cal numbers, especially "The Wizard and I," in which Elphaba's
character becomes truly evident as she expresses her vision for the
future of oz. Following such a fantastic performance, it was no
surprise that the audience practically jumped to give a standing
ovation at the end of the show.

“Wicked"s songs and dialogme are not only inspiring, but
relatablthpeople ofall ages can rake something away from the
story. While young adults may empathize widr Elphaba's scruggle
for a sense of self as she enters college, other audience members
may appreciate the difficult moral questions that “Wicked" brings
to light—what makes someone good?

How do we, as members of a society, inﬂuence individuals’ be
havior or paint them as a stereotype? Overall, “Wicked"leaves the
audience feeling bittersweet, with the sense that while no magic
can teach us compassion,we can learn it from each other.

Freesound opens doors, enables music

Student run muscial organization invites active partiticipation in campus bands, be it performance or participation

av SOLOMON MILLER

“I play music all the time. It’s what we do in this group,"
Michael Kober ’10 of Freesound said.

Freesound is a student-run group ofinusicians that facile
itares sharing, performing, and recording music. Bands and
solo artists can rent out Freesound's Equipmentilncludlng
various instruments, speakers, and mixersito play music.
Freesound also records and releases music of participating
bands.

“If you think you can get up on stage, and you have
something to say, you should try," Eliyah Afzal ’11 said.

Kober and Afzal are, along with a score of other musi—
cians, "active members" of Freesound. Active members are
responsible for running the organization, maintaining the
equipment, and making any decisions about what the Free-
sound should do. Anyone can become an active member,
simply by attending the meeting held every Wednesday at
9 pm, in Bob’s,

sors:

Fri. 30pm
Sat, .30pm
Sun. 1:30pm

The Ten:

Fri. 7:30pm
Sat. 0:30pm

If this seems ambiguous, it’s because it is. The members
of Freesound specifically wanted to avoid a hierarchical
structure, “[We asked,] ‘how would your favorite musicians
organize their music?’ So we did it," Afzal said. “We had to
do it with no rules. We had to do it with no leaders. It's
better that way... 1 consider myself an active member of a
living democracy."

on this note, one of the underlying principles behind
Freesound is that anyone should be able to join and the rules
are simple. "If your group is active in Freesound," Kober
said, “you're allowed to borrow our equipment." According
to Kober, this includes about ten bands.

Both Afzal and Kober want to see Freesound expand
over the coming year. To this end, bands in Freesound will
be providing an original score for a showing ofavantrgnrde
shorts hosted by the Cultural Film Series on November 6,
Members have also proposed an outdoor performance, a
show during a meal in the dining hall, and an increase in the

number of Freesound performances overall.

Also, in addition to the collection of Freesound music
released each Spring on cd and online, the Freesound web-
site may post LPs available for free download.

Freesound is highly available, with a website at www.
grinnailrontertr.ram/freercimd. Their campus username and
username on the popular cyber forum GrinnellPlans is
[freesoun] and they also maintain a blog and MySpace page
available through their website.

Beyond their online presence, Afzal believes there will
always be a place on campus for a collaborative group of
student musicians.

“It‘s important for students to express themselves in a
musical fashion,” Afzal said, “because music speaks to one‘s
emotions, which can be drowned by the toil and tedious
study over the dark weeks that lay in our future You should
probably save yourself by witnessing a Freesound ptoduv
