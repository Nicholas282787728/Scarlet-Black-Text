Mailroom practice and a possible pay-to-print system

lssues concerning distribution of newspaper

Every week, the 5ch comes with an invisible price tag for
each student. Through the Student Activities Feciwhich is
part of each snidents’ biannual payment to the school—writ-
ers, editors and photographers are paid in the same manner
that other publications pay their staff or SGA pays its cabinet
members.

But beyond student payrolls, each batch of approximately
1600 newspapers costs around $450 to print and delivcr~or
a iitde bit more than a quarter per student. Over the course of
a semester, each student pays roughly S3 for the materials and
labor that go into printing 12 issues ofthe sfrB—a reasonable
cost to bring the paper to campus.

But last Friday, it came to the attention of our staff that
each week 800 hard copies of the S81? are distributed to the
faculty and staff of the college soon after they are delivered
to the JRC's Mail Room. \Vhile the staff of the SSE aims to
have students, faculty, staff and the larger community read the
paper equally, and we are glad that college employees are given
access to the paper, we do nbt‘a‘pprove of the subsidization of
employee subscriptions via the Student Activity Fee.

Because of reasonable budget constraints, we are unable to
print out enough copies to keep the Mail Room stocked past
Sunday afternoon—not to mention enough for each student
to have their own copy if any group should have newspapers
delivered to their mailbox, it should be the students—they are
the ones who are bound to paying for the SEER.

But realistically speaking, we understand that not every stirs
dent does opt to read the school paper, That's why it makes
economical sense for the papers to be available to each student,
but not necessarily forced upon them—those who desire the
publication can pick one up, and those who do not can leave
one for the next person. That is why a batch of 1600 papers
should be enough for every person who wants onbassuming
that half are not preemptively put in the hands offaculry and
staff, whether they ask for it or not. If the faculty and staff don’t
want the copies they are given, there’s no opt-out beyond the
trash can and a wasted paper.

One must also consider that we publish the paper online at
wwﬂumndhmm in a browsersfriendly format as well as a pdf
version that is identical to our print copy This makes the box
service for many staff members obsolete. Most of us on staff

agree that there‘s nothing like a pulpy newspaper in your hands,
but we also know that most are adapting to a paperless news
world. Ifevcn 200 staff members began to read online, as many
students already do, and the other 600 picked up a paper in the
Mail Room, complaints of shortages would be fewer, or maybe
prim numbers could be lowered, saving money and trees.

In short, it is unfair to students to be required to front the
money for an employee subscription service, ﬁnancially and en-
vironmentally wasteful to indiscriminately hand out 16 pages
of paper to hundreds ofpcoplc who may not want a hard copy
and, overall, an outdated policy that serves no purpose beyond
providing convenience to some at
great cost to others.

This week, the SQfE will be den
livered to 800 faculty and staff once
again, so as to not suddenly disrupt
a practice that has existed for an in-
determinate number of years and
leave those expecting a paper paper-
less. However, in the coming weeks,
the S33, the Student Publication and Radio Committee
(SPARC) and Assistant Dean of Students and SPARC adviser
Travis Greene will be reforming the policy. Preliminary convers
sat-ions have included the possibility of delivering one seat to
each department, as well as continuing to supply the Trustees
and Office of Admissions with an appropriate number ofcop-
les

We are also looking into delivering the Sl‘jB to several locar
tions on campus, so that students, faculty and staff don’t have
to walk all the way to the JRC Mail Room to pick up a copy.

We are happy that the wider college community is reading
the sort: and hope they continue to do so. In an ideal world,
we would have enough money to print one for each person that
sets foot on this campus. As this is not the case, we want to
provide an equal opportunity for each member ofthe Grinnell
community [0 pick up a copy, at an equal convenience for eve
eryonc.

Possib ity of paying to print is provocative

Here at Grinncll,wc students enjoy a tremendous amount
of technological freedom. That's why the announcement by Bill
Francis, head oflnformation Technology services, that he has

begun writing a program intended to charge students for print»
ing, has gotten us thinking about how and when excess technor
logical Costs should be reigned in.

Initially, rhe idea of charging students to print may sound
unfair, but because the reasoning and system of charging are
still unknown, it is an important time to make sure any policy
treats the students and the budget fairly A proper system would
discourage excessive and unnecessary printing, while allowing
for the continuation of free, responsible printing for academic
and cxtraiurricular purposes.

If a charge per print system is going to be instituted, it is

. .7, imperative that students have signiﬁcant
, input on how it functions. There are far

too many aspects of the program that
could completely disadvantage students
and Grinncll College as a whole For ex-
ample, professors often cxpect students
to print out numerous pages of reading a
WCCk¥t0 do homework, students could
potentially be charged.

Currently, professors have the ability to track the number of
pages of documents accessed. A well thought—out system could
incorporate data of this type to insure that students are not
charged for the things they, are required to print.

Another common use for printing is announcing events via
posters. As of now, Grinuell has no better way to spread word of
events than by taping dozens of posters around campus, Limits
ing the ability to advertise events by making it unreasonably
expansive could be damaging to the overall Grinnell campus
culture. These two factors, as wdl as a plethora of other poten-
tial problems, must be worked out in an open dialogue between
ITS and students to ensure nobody is exploited.

In crafting our own system, examining the endeavors of our
peer institutions is a good place to strut discussion. Whitman
College, an institution very similar to Grinnell, credits students
with 1,200 pages per semester, and once they overrun that total,
they begin to pay two cents per page. While a carbon—copy of
this system may not work at Grinnell, surely some inspiration
can be drawn from this, or other schools programs.

50 ITS,please come to us with ideas and we will return with
our own, hopefully leading to a genuine compromise that both
reduces waste and does not empty our change purses.

Campus food, celebrations remain ticklish topics

With the first ever Grinnell Tickle City
Award given in the last column, student or
citement over the award sccms to be builds
mg, while campus food continues to be one
of the most ticklish Grinnell topics. SUB
sports columnist Kramer McLuckie wrote to
the Grinnell Tickle City Award Committee
to comment on the ticklishness of the Local
Foods night in rhe dining hall on Sept. 29.
“Hats off to Dick Williams and all the farin-
ers; I think they're tickle crty,"hc wrote in an
email, before singling out the coffeesrubbcd
cheeseburgers as the most ticklish item of the
night.

Otlicr students agree with McLuckic, and
in the days following Local Foods night many
have been spotted buying large coffees from
rho Spencer Grill and rubbing the ho. liquid
all ovei items like (lie Turkey Burger, Chicken
Parmesan sandwich and Hummus QICSRT
dan with Jalapenos in an attempt to recreate

the taste. Often, it has not gone well and sells
eral students have suffered mild blirns. Others
have googled the definition of i coffee rub and
quickly abandoned their efforts.

To build on the success oflocal foods night,
the dining hall has decided to associate with lo
cal dairy Anderson Er~
rckson and will also be
unveiling the blue light
special “Possum Pic,”
possibly made from lo-
cal possums.

Movrng on, my current downtown, posts
graduation life continues to make me miss out
on a lot of campus happenings. This wcck,l
am very curious iflast week's outspoken critic
of the S88 accepted the editorial staff's offer
ofcoming in to the office to help out. It looked
like a very reasonable response from the staff
or perhaps a sneaky attempt to get him alone
in the office so they could overpower him and
write all over his face with a red pen for his
offensive comments Anyone with answers or
another tickle city idea should not hesrtatc to
notify [walsliand]

Finlill , there have also been reports of a
ticklish new website recently that can be found
at trik/etrg/aamlrtwm. While these rumors
have not yet been confirmed, the site is at best
the second-most ticklish oftlrcm all, after f/rts

Stay ticklish, Grinncll!
