I guess i think the ﬁrst question should be something you
mentioned a lot in your talk. What role does humor play in
your life, notjust as a trans person but as a person in general?

Well my fiwonlc unit about me is my sense othumor. This
particular topic can make people uncomfortable. I think humor
sometimes helps to lower rhe discomfort label It lcrs people see
things clearer. My sense or lulmol is an integral part etwho 1 am,
ofllow I see thlngs cvcly day It makes me smile

Does it play a role in your advocacy and activism?

My activism has any number otditt'crent shapes. Coming to
events like this and talking to them ls one of them but sitting
in a boardroom and making decisions about money is another.
Making decisions about polities and about leadership is not the
place for humor I think its really important to use humor, or to
be Wlse enough to know' ln what context it will help, but there

also times that lts leally serious business, and thatsjustwhat
l s.

Does it break down barriers? Does humor play a social
function?

I think it does. As a lmns community, we're very uptight.
There are those in the trans community who will see a drag show,
and they’ll get offendediTherc are those in the trans community
who don't see any entertainment value, any community value,
in that. But when you look at the folks who go to these things,
they’re a lot of fun.'l‘here’s no one thing that makes something
humorous or not, but I do think that it plays an important role,
especially in these kind of discussions, because there were some
people today who felt that some of the things I said were humor-
ous and some who didn’t, and that’s just the
way it goes. ,

I guess I’d like to add on to that. You had ‘

a lot of support during your txansition and
maybe the people who are very serious about »
these issues are thinking of the people who
had no support. Do you feel llkeyou've had a
lot ofprivilege or gifts inyour life?

I am the ﬁrst to admit that I still living in
the world of privilege. Thar being white in '
this culture carries some privilege, that having
a skill and a career especially given the current
economy, are things that you really appreciate.

Having the money to go through some of these

expensive procedures mat some of us have to

go through; itsjust a very expensive dung. I’ve been privileged' in
many ways, and I think I continue to be privileged, because Ive
been able to continue my relationship with my son,I ve been able
to maintain my relationship with my family, So I don’t think any
of us needs to apologize for those things, but they have been key
aspects to why or how I‘ve gotten to where I am today.

I thought it was interesting when you said that you loved
to allow yourselrto be vulnerable sometimes in these minor-
ity communities, some feel that a sense of strength needs to
be projected to show the oppressive forces that they have their
own strength. You were a wrestler and a football player, and
you did talk about how estrogen therapy opened you up, but
when did this idea ofleadingalifewhich would have a“legncy'
ofvulnerability come around?

Its not an easy answer. My approach to being a guy was a
pretty simple one, and one of the main tenets was avoid being

perceived as vulnerable, When I felt I was being attacked, my
response was one ofanger. When you hurt me, my response was
one otangerWhen any number otthings happened,ituas really
easy for me to turn them into anger. But the key to life for me
these days, the key to just being human, is that we are vulnerable,
and vulnerability is not a trait is not a trait we need to apologize
for. For the longest time, I was concerned that those were walls I
could not take down, that I had been conditioned over the course
of my life to be that strong person to allow yourself to be put in
that position where you could be hurt would
not be something I could do. But I have been
hurt, and I have grown from it, and I have
grown to appreciate it.

Do you feel like you're still in a process
of discovering? There’s male/female, but
also this idea that you mentioned, “I ﬁnd
myselfto be a mutt."

I think we're 'all are. To rue life is a con-

’ stant process of growth and change. Many

. transsexual people are ofthe opinion that the

transition ends at some point, and too often,

that's with the surgery. One of the questions

that I'm often asked is did I have a mental

picture of what Donna would be like, or what

life as Donna would be like. It’s light years away, and that’s just

based on the fantasy, or making assumptions based on your own

head instead of your life experience. I find that I’m very much

David sometimes. The discipline that I learned as a wrestler was

something I would have had trouble gaining as Donna, At the
same time, it's the blending that makes the difference

At the same time, [wonder about what was brought up as

a critique of your work in the talks the naturaliziug ways of

talking. I’m wondering if you think that living your life and

discovering is a kind of experiential counter to these ways of

thinking, because what you say and how you talk about your

identity is a controversial issue in many of these queer come

annuities.

it is a controversial issue.To me, the tact that it's complicated,

that can’t keep people from having the discussion or respecting

that there are many people whose realities are different than your

own, As one of the questions tonight talked about gender as a
construct, and I answered that I'm not out to break clown gender
as a construct, I’m not out to rationalize feminism, or other very
important things. At the same time, the key isn’t how you feel
about your gender, it’s getting people to respect how you make
decisions about yourself. That’s not the same topic.

so you would support the work otfeniinise and theorists,
and then say “tints not my thing, my thing's political activism
and speaking"?

When I ﬁrst started to get involved in advocacy, someone
told me, “Don’t be a martyr for your cause". And I don’t even
know, necessarily, what the cause is Part of the problem is that
my cause is equality I’m reviewing a book written by a tmns
woman that deﬁnes trans gender as being contrary to traditional
gender norms, but realistically, I ﬁt into traditional gender norms
for women.I believe in the constmct ofgender so much that I've
gone through a lot to fit myseltinto it. It would be disingenuous
to say that gender doesn't matter to me, because I like who 1 am,
today, inside the construct of gender. I never planned to be an
activist, and at some point I think I’ll eventually fade away, and
settle down with my partner, and do the things that other people
take for granted Right now, there have been too many opportu-
nities to be involved and to be ln the workplace not to take them

Can you speak speciﬁcally to how men have dinicolty
expressing themselves in society as feminine, to how narrow
masculinity really is as a paradigm? Is it more or less difﬁcult
as a man, or is that kind of eluding the question of what it
means to be either one?

Each ofcxprcsscs our gender, and feels our gender, in unique
waysThat's wllyI said itwe had ﬁve people up here, each one of
us would express a different reality Each oftl-lose realities would
be true. We're looking for easy answers to really complicated
questions and some things other trans people drink may not at-
feet them, like same-sex marriage, or AIDS [matter to me].I live
in a world that is interconnettedWhat happens in this broader
LBGT spectrum matters to all of us, and we have to see how
the rest of society looks at us.They don't make the distinctions
we do.
