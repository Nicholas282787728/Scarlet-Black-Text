Music ADD

BYJAMES ANTHOFER

Miami—based Awesome New Republic
sounds like vice, Slick surfaces and pastels
colored melodies hide a grisly visceral nas-
tiness that makes you wanr to swcan Morc
succinctly, they’re Don-Johnson hot. n welr
come breeze from the south in this early
winter.

It’s no wonder that “Gossip Girl" star
Leighton Meester worked with the three
piece to create a new version of their hit
song “Birthday” as a way to juinpstart her
music careerr ANR are a poprculrure jelly
fish, crafting songs that challenge Girl Talk
in their ADD genrevbending glory, quick
beats that make Passion Pit sound boring
and lyrics that help make their love ofTwrv
ter seem totally ok. They're like that friend
who constantly verges on the edge ofobnox-
iousness but always ends up being totally 3p,
pealing.

If you have any questions about what
this all means, check out how ANR and
their label marketed their last two albums,
“Rational Geographic l and ll." They went
to prominent downloading sites and encour-
aged the people on the sites to download
them for free. It's a model that has its pulse
on out culturciif it makes you dance, you
might just buy it “Geographic" is suppos-
edly a concept album, but it's mostlyjust ine
sanely fun, all ridiculous falsetto and absurdt
ly diverse beats. Their lead vocalist goes by
Michael john Hancock, also known as M},
and he often (gulp) one-ups Justin Timbers
lake in his imitation ofthe late, great master.

Their new album “Hearts,” which they
will be touring on, includes three tracks from
the still-free "Geographic" and eight new
tracks. These include “Deep Love,” which
should get the Gardner crowd excited with
its smart people-friendly lyrics—“You've got
the moves to make me/ finally stay/intellecr
tual/in a sexual mind!"

The cooing, singular chorus of "Deep
looovee/ooooo" simply seals the dealithese
guys are hot. Come get your prerHalloween

E’rinnell students organize food film festival

An innovative approach to mic-semester exams results in a four part festival on America’s most nourishing Cooperations

 

t-ivJUMl BELLO

Next Wednesday at 7 p.m., new sociology professor Craig
Uprights Food sc society class will conclude their Food Film
Festival with a showing ofthe ﬁlm “Fresh."

Grinnell's ﬁrst Food Film Festival was
born when Upright realized that due to the
farming culture of Grinneil‘s surrounding
area, the film would be of interest not just to
his class but to the greater college community.
The Films Committee agreed to Uprights re-
quest to show “Fresh" in the Harris Cinema,
and went on to ask if there were other similar
ﬁlms he wanted to show.

Jake McVeigh '11, along with Maxx Fore
tell '12, Lorejunc Fernandez'lZ and Ami Freebetg'lOVall stu—
dents from Uprights class~became the real organizers of the
food festival. ottered as an alternative to writing a paper for their
mid—semester exam, the students eagerly took the opportunity.

”This ﬁ/m fest/W has four dammed
tar/es looking at different aspects of
how the food that is produced In the
United States comes to our [db/e.”

They organized the bulk orthe event, particularly the Wednes-
day showing of “Fresh" and the panel discussion afterwards,

“We had to ﬁnd funding, ﬁnd a place to show the ﬁlm, ﬁnd
panel participants along with promot-
ing the ﬁlm," Mcveigh said. “Basically,
all the legwork."

“This ﬁlm festival has four docut
mentaries looking at different aspects
of how the food that is produced in
the United States comes to our table,"
Upright said. “it's centered around the
movie ‘Ftesh,’ which is looking at sev-
eral different alternative producers who
are trying to enter the main steam mare
ker and sell their goods."

The four panel participants that McVeigh and the other or-
ganizets selected are all active in the world orthe food produc-
tion. They include a ﬁfth generation Iowa farmer, a cofounder of

Craig Upright

a non-proﬁt organization promoting entrepreneurial agriculture
in the metropolitan area, a President Emeritus of the National
Family Farm Coalition and a representative from Freemont
Farms of 10m.

The discussion panel will take place after the showing of
“Fresh" on Wednesday at 7 pm. in IRC 101. The other three
ﬁlms that Will be showing are “Food, Inc.” on Monday, “King
Corn" on Tuesday and “The Real Dirt on Farmer John" on
Thursday, all at 8 pm. in Harris Cinema. The Center for Prairie
Studies will be serving popcorn from locally grown corn during
are viewing orrhe ﬁlms.

“1 think [the festival] is very important and offers [intellectu-
al] opportunities up to students who usually wouldn’t rake a ‘Soc
class or give a second thought to how our food is produced and
how we get food in the D»hall,"McVeigh said. “It gives them a
chance to see what’s really going on.The system we have in place
is not the best system and itjust won't last. It's the least efﬁcient
and isn't really good for anybody"
