World Headlines

‘King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has cancelled the sen-
tence ofﬂogging on a female journalist who worked for a
TV channel that aired graphic accounts of sex. The jour»
nalist, Rozanna al-Ynlni, was sentenced to 60 lashes after
the program was broadcast, exhibiting taboos that existed
in the Saudi Arabian world, which included extraemarital
sex. One of the four men who described his technique
for having sex with Saudi women was also sentenced to
1,000 lashes, as well as five years in jail. Three other men
were sentenced to two years in jail a piece and the camera
man was placed injail for two months. It is not clear why
the king decided to intervene in a high-proﬁle ﬂogging
sentence.

Confirmed cases of H1N1 on campus

Several students quarantined after showing swine flu symptoms, campus responds

av PETER SuLLiVAN

Cases of the H1N1 virus, or “swine ﬂu," have been cone
firmed on the Grinnell campus, causing approximately 25 stu
dents robe quaranrined.

"I knew [H1N1] would be here," said Director of the
Grinnell College Health Center Karen Cochran. "Wejust need
to make sure no one gets so sick [that] they need more than rest
and fever reducers."

The school has responded to student illnesses by quaran-
tining infected students in their dorm rooms. Any student with
a fever over 100 degrees is told to stay in their room until they
have been without a fever for 24 hours. These students are also
issued “sick kits” that include surgical masks, and are told to
wear a mask when going to the bathroom. Bagged meals are
provided from Dining Services. All students who are quarane
tined get evaluated by a doctor at rhc Grinnell Regional Medie
cal Center, and are asked to call the Health Center daily to
checkein.

Cochran said that despite the quarantines, H1N1 cannot
be completely contained,largely due to the fact that people are
contagious 24 hours before they exhibit any symptoms. It is not
confirmed that everyone quarantined has had H1N1 and not
another illness, but it is conﬁrmed from blood tests that at least
two individuals with H1N1 are on campus.

“The cows are out ofthe barn, so to speak." Cochran said.

The ﬁrst infected srudcnrwas quarantined on Sept. 25, but
the highest number ofcascs recorded on campus has been so far
in the week of Oct. 12. In that week alone, there were over 400

The interview is your chance to convince em—
ployers that you are the best person for the job. In
terms of preparation, researching the organization
and knowing yourself are absolutely essential. Be—
fore the interview, think about good responses to
possible questions such as “Describe two strengths
and two weaknesses?" When answering questions
about speciﬁc tasks performed, practice the STAR
method: SITUATION: recall a situation related
to the questionTASK: explain What the task Was.
ACTION: what action did you take? RESULTS:

student visits to the Health Center.This number includes those
students who have believed they had H1N1 when they simply
had lower-level symptomsThe number ofcontractcd cases this
week has “tapered off," Cochran said.

Those on campus who havc had the H1N1 virus have expee
rienced relatively mild symptoms. “I only had a mild fever but
I had a serious cough," said Will Bennett '13, who had H1N1
over Fall Break. "1 had a mask and just tried to stay away from
people."

Currently, there are no H1N1 vaccines available on campus,
but Cochran has been discussing the possibility of giving vac-
cinations to the general student body with the Public Health
Department of Grinnell Regional Medical center. The vac-
cine would bt: available at the clinic on campus within the two
weeks of approval from Friday Cochran plans to send out an
allecampus emad when the vaccine becomes available,

According to Cochran, only students who fall under the
Tier 1 category ofthe l-l1N1 risk groups currently have access
to the vaccine. This category, defined by the government's Cene
ter for Disease Control, includes students who are 18 years or
younger and have chronic medical conditions, such as asthma.
Individuals who are pregnant are also included.These students
will be able to get vaccinated at the medical center in the com-
ing days.

Despire the number ofcases on campus and seemingly con-
tinuous discussion on campus, students remain relatively une
rufﬂed. “rm not worried about any type otﬂu," said Wendy ch
’13.“The news media has made too big a fuss about it."

what results did you get? During the interview,
present yourself professionally with appropriate
dress, a firm handshake and good eye Contact.
Make sure to prepare questions for the employer
to show your interest in the position/organizae
tion: Examples include: Could you describe a
typical day of work? or what is the work culture
like? Following your interview, send a brief, polite
business thank you through snail mail. Finally, set
up a Mock Interview with the CDC beforehand
so that you're ready for the real interview!
