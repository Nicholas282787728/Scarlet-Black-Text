Hooray for gay! Queer is here! Iowa marriage rights extended

Supreme coun rules in favor of gay marriage

Last Friday, many Grinneii students awokc to the news
that the lows Supreme Court had mled u statewide ban on gay
marriage unconstitutional. The ruling, which was unanimously
agreed upon by the seven Justices, effectively opens the door
for samersex couples to wed in the state of Iowa. The news was
sur islng and inspiring, and will have a gargantuan impact on
individuals. the College, and the nation.

As it state, Iowa is often eiioneously lumped into the con-
sctvalivc "Bible Belt," or discarded as a mundane “Flerver
Stare.'The assumptions run from coaststo-coasr, and the re-
actions to the court decision exhibited national stereotypes of

Sketchy petitioning being done by the

Ever heard of “bait and switch"?

Try this: go up to some patrons in the dining hall the day
before spring break and ask them ifthey'll sign your petition
Approach them nicely, and
when they ask you what the
petition is about, explain very
humbly that you just want a
few changes made to some
school policies. Chances are
that you’ll get some comphs
mcntiLry smiles, and the students will sign your petition just to
have you move on. Bait.

Then try this: take your petition list,and explott it for a rice
holds»barrcd, in-yoursface campaign filled with upsidc—down
logos, aggressive demands, and vaguely woided threats of “es-
eillation”iftltey are not complied With. But, to make the trick
really powerful, publish the list of petitioners on the interner
and proclaim that they'ie equal members ofa non-hierarchical
organization that reaches its decisions through collective diS’
cusslon and switch.

The Chase

Iowa at thcit strongest. There was talk of corn, tractors and
farmers, but mostly surprise at the willingness efour Midwest-
ern state to join the ranks of only three other ,
states, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Ver— /
mont, and become part nfthc small proportion
of our nation that recognizes sainessex matings
es. With the ruling, that stereotype was jolted, _
and more importantly, in 'aniplc was set for
other states. Days after lowa's repeal of the ban,
Vermont legislature pas d a bill allowing same-sex marriage.
In the face of d more LGBTrFriel-idly Iowa, hopefully states
that pride themsches in their progressive nature, such as Calls
fornia or New York, will fool the pressure to follow our lead.

This, in a nutshell, is my expcricncc with the No Limits
Project. When I signed the petition on March 14, 2009, I was
never informed that I had signed up for a radical campaign
of escalating action. Not until the next
morning. anyway, when 1 received in my
campus mailbox a bombastic fake news
paper infoiming me that what i thought
“yesterday" were “requests," had “today," in
fact, become “demands." The contrast be
tween each day could not have been stark-
er, where dialog reigned before. command reigned today.

Further, despite their pretension to “nondiicrarchical”decir
sionsmaking, No Limits did not once ask me for input between
the dayl signed up and the day they launched their campaign.
I doubt they asked any other petitiornsigners for input then,
either. NLP‘s egalitarian ihetoiic aside, 200 students did not
simply meet one night to openly discuss and vote on the best
strategies for success.

No. The opening tactics of the No Limits Pioject had al-
ready been preset by its initial organl'lers, and they somewhat

However, plenty ofconcems still rcmain.The ruling is rea-
son enough to celebrate. but not enough to end the work that

has been done thus far towards create
ing a more equal state. The possibil-
ity ofa vote to allow a constitutional
convention by 2011, in which a ban
could be reinstated, is worrisome. The
' dccision was made by a group ofseven
justices, and a vote on the issue could
potentially change the climate of equal' v within the state. So
take the enthusiasm harvested this past week, and carry it into
the weeks and months to come. out srnte, country and, most
importantly, our neighbors will be better off for it.

No Limits Project

deceptively marshaled 200 signatures so as to add a superﬁcial
layer ofmassdegitlmacy to these tactics. Worse, contacting the
organizers today is next to impossible, because the No Limits
Project website obfuscates them. For example, according to the
FAQpage, you can find 30 “selected” student contacts on the
NLP list of demands. Go to the demands page, however, and
these “selected contacts“ are nowhere to be found.

Moreover, who exactly "selected" these smdentsiot on
what criteria they were “selected"—is another mystery. Pres
sumably some preexisting group ofleaders chose them, because
as a petition-signer, I certainly never got a ballot,

I feel saddened by all this. The No Limits Frojcct has some
admirable objectives,whlch, at the very least, deserve attention
and campus-wide discussion, indeed, some of the less costly
objectives could probably even be implemented, if focused on
rhc right institutional channels. But the tone ofthe Project has
alienated some ofirs own petition-signers, including me. Ifyou
signed the petition and want offofit now as well, 1 suggestyou
send the anonymous No Limits account an email,

Just don't fall for the old bait and switch.

Countless ways available to safely explore issues of sex

Just the other day. I found myselfthinking
about N50, and how it has been almost four
years since I first came here to start my college
career on that hot, sticky day in August,

Before I started college, it was always an
elusive, mysterious and exciting destiny, one
thatl knew I was aiming for but felt I’d never
reach. When 1 ﬁnally got here, the campus
seemed confusing and social interactions were
awkward and exciting, filled with the energy
of lS-yeareolds on the threshold ofsomcthing
new and amazing in their lives who did not
quite grasp it fully,

1 also vividly remember having the same
conversation over and over again. Let’s face
it, when you throw random teenagers together
in the middle of rural Iowa, rhcrc are only it
few things you can come up with to talk about
at first. The questions (you all know them)
went something like this: What's your name>
Whele are you from? What was you. GPA in
high school> Are you a virgin?

Okay, maybe not everyone's experience was
like that, but almost certainly there was some

sort of sexual curiosity that we all had about
each other. NSO activities forced us to face
issues of intimacy and sexual health in ways
some of us had never experienced. lwent to
public high school in South Carolina—the
only thingI learned about sex in the classroom
was to “per your dog. not your ditcl"

For me, it was positively liberating and ex—
hilarating ro come to a place where folks were
willing to acknowledge their innate sexualitles
and desires. i remember finding out quickly
which ofmy fellow first-year fiiends had done
the deed(s) or notibcing positively curious
about those who'd had sex while fccliiig rc-
lleved that I wasn't the only one who hadn’t.

Grinnell has opened up a whole new world
ofscxudltry for me. College has bccn my sexu-
al revolution. Once I let sex into my life—not
having sex, per se, but learning about issues
of sexuality and scxlml health, seeing people
making out at Hairis and hearing my neigh-
bors bumping i. he night and buying my lirst
vibrator at the Lions Den—it really stopped
being such a big deal. suddenly, I was in coir

lege and sex was everywhere and that was nor-
mal. My friends from

high school, mostly
Southern Baptists
who are still saving
themselves for more
iiage (no judgments
here, were just very
different kinds of
people), nevei ever talked abour these kinds of
things.

If you haven't taken advantage ofthe kind
of sexual freedom we have here,you should rc-
ally check it out. I don’t mean to tell you to
go out and screw the next Grinnellian you see,
although you can ifyou want to Rather, dont
be afraid to check out the impressive spread
of sex rt: latcd activities we have on this came
pus. Audition for the drag show, go get dental
dams and condoms from the health center. at
tend a masturbation workshop, participate in
Love loui Body week, go to the Rocky llors
rot Picture Show and dont forget to yell out

homesick aboition, streak, write something

'Thc'Ethicat slut '

for the Grinneli Monologues, check out Less
bian Movie
Night and Orr
ganized Pros
crastination
(LMNOP), go
to Underwear
Ball. There ale
countless ways
to safely explore issues of sex and sexuality
without going too far outside of our comfort
zones. We go to a school where it doesn’t re-
ally matter whether we've slept with 12 people
or are holding out for something a little more
special,

I’ve learned more about sex in my four
years here than any other time in my life. Part
of that comes with developing into a young
adult, but a lot of my knowledge and experis
ence comes from growing in a place that en
couragcs and supports my being a sexual crea-
ture. I can teach you a thing or two ifyou want
(not like that, shut up), but why don't you go
and find out on your own> It's fun,1 promise.
