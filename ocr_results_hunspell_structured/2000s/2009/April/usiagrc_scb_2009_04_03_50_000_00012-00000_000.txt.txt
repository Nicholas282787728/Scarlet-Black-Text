Time to start preparing for an inevitable zombie invasion

Rachel Fields ’09 may not have the appropriate weaponry to fight off mobs of angry zombies should they attack in the near future

I spent spring break in the exotic locale
of Lemont, 111., home to the state’s largest
cookie jar collection. a haunted softball field
and the Lemont High School llijun. I wish we
were playing two truths and a lie right now,
but all of those things are true. I don't even
know which one is the most ridiculous, but I
do know that if you thought the “state’s larg-
est cookie jar collection" might be a rollicking
good time, you would be wrong. Dead wrong.

Lemont recently decided to tear down
our Target, effectively sealing our victory as
the World’s Worst Vacation
Destination and ruiliing my
lifeln the past, lfl had, say,
three hours to kill, I could
go to Target and browse the
children’s toy section. Sure,
all that security video foota
age ofrne brushing the hair
ofCabbage Patch dolls isn't
going to win me any political positions, but
that’s not the point.

The point is that for the stretches of no“,
Grinnell time, I could do something other
than sitat home and eat clam chowder straight
from the can.

With the Target gone,l had to find some-
thing else to occupy my time. You're probably
thinking books or movies or running or fam-
ily interaction, but I laugh at all those sugges-
tions I had something much more important
in mind—preparing for an inevitable invasion
of zombies.

Let me preface this by saying that I should

never, ever, under any cir
cumstances, be encourt
aged to think about possit
ble apocalyptic situations.
It’s just too easy to use
them as a procrastination
tool. “Uh, yeah, I (An/M
write this paper,"l think at
4 am on Thursday night.
“But are zombies going to be affected by teams
ofpapcr cuts? Better get to work fashioning a

kataria out of this Wallnart lamp.”

Since I read Max Brooks’ “The Zombie
Survival Guide" a few months ago, I've been
somewhat cont
ccrncd about my
lack of ability to
fight off the liv-
ing dead—or the
living, or small
animals, inania
mate objects, a
crippling sense of directionlessness, or pretty
much anything else,

Ifzombies could be killed by a sense ofccr
medic timing, 1 might be okay, but as it is, I
would be among the first to go

Over this break, I read a book called
“World War Z, "a scarlly detailed “oral history"
of a zombie war. The niaili lesson I learned
from the book was that ifyou want to survive a
zombie apocalypse, it's probably better ifyou're
notliving at 1126 Broad Sti‘eet.Whatwith out
two unguarded entrances, our lack ofimmedi-

ate weaponry and our propensity to drink wine
in the afternoon,we don't stand a chalice.

I recently surveyed my room for potential
weapons, and the
only things I could
find were a broken
hair dryer, a bag of
Bananagrams tiles,
and a photograph of
me sporting a bowl
cut in sixth grade

At this point, l'm pretty much counting

on a lesser-known zombie weakness being a
penchant for word games, or a strong sense of
l .

P ty1 have a feelingl might be avoiding prepar-
ing for graduation by preparing for the end of
the world instead. I might run into problems
come May 18, but think about it, if the zoms
bies don’t come,l can always scronnge around
for a job, Good luck building a makeshift kas
tuna on that kind ofshort notice.

Growing up in the 19505 surrounded by extended family

One of the myths prevalent when i grew
up in the 1950s was that people lived in (0*
tally nuclear families and that women did not
work outside of the home. My own upbririgr
ing, largely in Massachusetts, involved regular
interactions with a very large extended family,
including people who had emigrated or whose
parents had emigrated to the United states,
and a large number ofprofessional women.

My mother’s parents, James Russell and
Annie Guthrie, were both from immigrant
families that came to the United States from
Scotland (and also went back from time to
time for further education and to see fume
ily). Both of my mother's parents had a dozen
brothers and sisters. We didn’t interact with all
of them because some had returned to Scott
land or lived far away but we did see some of
the others regularly. A number of them, men
and women, never married and had various 0:7
cupations including college and public school
teaching

respectively. My
Grandmother
Osgood grew up
in Oak Grove in
Maiden after her m
mother died of
diphtheria while her father was deployed to
Cuba during the spamshaAmerican War.

My grandmother was raised by her motha
er’s sister, my Aunt Grace Dean, who never
married and was a professional musician,
playing and teaching piano and the trumpet
in hotels around New England, Aunt Grace's
parents owned the dairy store on the corner in
Oak Grove (the lnilk came from a family farm
in Cochituatc, Mose).

Across the street my Grandmother’s Mag-
ee grandparents (originally from Nova scotia)
owned the grocery store. She had several Dean
uilclcs who also lived in Oak Grove and taught
the French horn and the bassoon. Her father
owned a legal stationery business in Boston
and was an official in the American Legion.
My Grandfather Osgood had a sister, Jessie,
who never married and was an accountant
with the New England Confectionery Com
pany (NECCO) at its main Cambridge office
His other sister, Mollie, married the ChiefEnr
gineer of the New Haven railroad and 1 saw a
lot ofher when I attended college,

The amazing thing about all ofthese rela—
tives is that they were uniformly long-lived
and I got to know a large number of them. In-

deed, we lived with them in series during the
summer in in old Cottage in Rockport, Massa-
chusetts.which the family still owns, My great
aunts and uncles and my great-grandmother
(Called “Aunt Emma") would visit the house
while my family was staying there (my parents
and my brother and sister). We would be there
with my Osgood grandparents, my fathers
disabled brother, and a kaleidoscope of these
relatives.

I can’t imagine a better education as I grew
up. They were all different and interesting.
Living with my disabled uncle was a seminal
experience in my life because I learned about
living with someone of different abilities, and
i also saw my grandmother dedicate herself to
seeing that my uncle had every chance to live a
good life,a dedication that literally lasted until
the minute she died in a Boston hospital many
years later,

My Russell grandparents came to live
eventually in Methucn, Massachusetts and
were different but just as interesting. My
grandfather was a learned and literaryaminded
Presbyterian minister. He was a wonderful fig-
ure matched only by
his wife, my Grand-
mother Russell, who
spoke English with a
heavy Gaelic brogue.
She had a feisty dis-
position and was a
master of the house
and the family. My grandfather was intellect
ton] and not practically minded. I remember
my grandmother even managing her death (at
home) ofceercal cancer and then the void af
ter she died. She had a large coterie ofbrothers
and sisters that left my mother and my sibt
lings and me with a number of Scottish (and
Pennsylvanian) cousins. She loved Zane Grey
westerns and tried very hard to escape the role
of being the minister’s wife. She was a superb
Scottish cook and everything 1 know about
budget management I learned from her and
from my other grandmother, l-lelen Osgood,
a smait managci and investor.

This could go on and on but i will finish
with one other aspectofmy family. My mother
had two brothers and a sister and we would
occaSlonally see their children (my Russell
cousins). More important iii terms ofcontact,
my father had a second brother who had fwe
children and a wife from the south, my Aunt
MaryWhile my older relatives would come to
visit for relatively short periods of time (one
week or so), my Osgood cousins, Joy, Susan,
Helen, Bobby and Tommy, would come for a
month and stay in a nearby cottage.

There were, no doubt, tensions in all ofthis

family proximity but my cousins were a tree
mendously important aspect ofour family life.
Tommy and Bobby both died tragically while
young but my brother, sister and 1 still occa-
sionally see my three other cousins, Joy, Susan,
and Helen, and visiting with them is a way that

all ofthe memories of our growing up with the
wonderful aspects and the hard lessons about
death and sadness can be recalled gently.

So,\vliilc life in the 1950‘s certainly had its
negative aspects, in my case it was not a life of
isolated nuclear families.
