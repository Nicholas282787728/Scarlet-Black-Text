HAM AND SWISS ON OATMEAL BREAD
GEL

Ir is hard to mess up 1n American classic sueh 1s the h11n 1nd
Swiss, yet the people 1t Dining Services m1n1ge to do it once
agnin. Something so simple shouldn't rcquirc the addition of
four paeltets of m1yortr11ise just to he 1hle to t1lte 1 hite. It
hogs the question whether that is te1lly11am 1nd cheese 1n th1t

PEPPERONI AND PROVOLONE SUB
IQQEC

While getting a sandwich at the Out Take Lin: is usually a last
resort, the pepperoni and provolone sub gives mnny 1 respite,
The sandwich, While not a foot long from your favorite sub
plaee, is more th1n edihle on its own. For a truly fulﬁlling meal,
warm up your sandwich in the microwave and add a hit of salad
dressing—your stom1eh will thank you.

CHEESE AND VEGETABLE BOWL
@IQD

It‘s hard to he vegetarian anywhere, but when you don’t have
time to visit the dining hall, life becomes that much harder. It is
without a douht that the eheese and vegetable bowl is 1 savior
for many on the Grinnell campus. It is simple nnd delicious,
a kickback to 111 afternoon summer p'tenie treat, While not 1s
good as the stufrfrom the farmer’s market, its still better than
any other vegetarian el1oice Out Takes has to offer.

GARDEN SALAD WITH CURRIED CHICKPEAS

As everyone already knows, one thing Dining Services tan
never do right is ethnit foodidining hall naan anyone? This
halfshearted attempt at a salad is both nauseating and barely

p1l1tnh1e. Even covered 11 dressmg, the 11111 or1prtes111st .

ITALIAN COMBO SUB
DECIDE.

By far the best thing on the Grills p1lt1y ollmlke menu, this
snndwieh jusl m1n1ges to hit the spot. Warm or cold, with o1-
without c1e1myIt1li1n dressing, you just c1nnot go wrong. Still,
when the host thing on the out Takes menu is eotnpnrahlc to
1 day—old snndwieh at any s1ndw'1eh shop, it begs the question
what Dining Services does with that 511 you give them for
every me11.

VEGETABLE CIABAT’I‘A
{ii a

The vegetable eiahotta is 1 nite, refreshing break from what
usually consists of slop 1nd/o1 heavy slices of meat. Lilse any
boring salad on decent hrend, this s1ntlwieh Won't upset your
stomach or fill you up, unless you liberally 1pply mustard 1nd
mayonnaise. For an added tre1t, throw everything in the h1g
on this s1ndwieh—c11rors, ehocolnte chip cookies 1nd Garden
Salsa Sun Chips only m1lte this s1ndwieh better.

PITAWITH SPICYTHREE-PEPPER HUMMUS
C1

The ﬁrst time I took a bite of this monstrosity, I lioavcd twice
and spit out the contents onto the black Grill table where I was
sitt1ng,There are few things that make me g1g, and rh1s mushy
conglomeration of trash was the first since a brown banana in
elementary school, What seems to be old tomatoes, lettuce stot
ion from the dumpster behind Subway and the vilcst hummus
the Grill could ﬁnd is leaps and bounds the most revolting,
disgusting item I've ever optionally eaten. My tomy into tasting
it this year w1s similar to 11st, and this revolting item found its
way into the trash after less than two hires. -

CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD
WQL’JOL

While this salad does eontain inoffensive lettuce (check) and

salty black olives (check plus), the hunk of gelatinous, graye

ing chicken breast (theelt minus) knocks this salad down 1 few
notches. The peppereorn lightly sprinkled on the poultry does,

in small w1ys, mask the ﬂavor of old mc11,
out this snl1d would he much hetter with cold
cuts or another form ofpmtein (sec: ChefSalnd).

CHEF SALAD WITH TURKEYAND HAM
IQ Ell; ‘F‘i

It's like the ehiehen C1cs1r salad (soc 1hove),without doeaymg
thicken and with protessed meats. Crunch your chips up in it,
1nd, hey, m1yoe throw in some extra emote.

BROWN RICEAND LENTIL SALAD
ICJCSCJC]

Aftcr confusing this for the eomp1r1tiveiy gourmet white hean
vegetable s111d,I was disappointed when I tasted nothing. Akin
to what one would eat during the ﬂu,I felt neither energetie not
pleased] felt nothing. And that’s what this tastes like. Nothing

TURKEYAND PROVOLONE 0N WHOLE GRAIN
m

Another entry in the mushy sandwich collection, the turkey and
provolone does rise above its pork-based brethren, largely bev
cause provolone is simply 1 better cheese.This sandwich lends
itselfwcll to 1 ro1sting session in the upright Grill toaster, but
don't let my employees or other patrons witness your cheese-
rnelting act.
