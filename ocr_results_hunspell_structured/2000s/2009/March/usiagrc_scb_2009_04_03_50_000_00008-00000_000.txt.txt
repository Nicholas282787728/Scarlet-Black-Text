Tommy Johnson x2 jam out.

Father and son share love ofjazz, played with jazz greats in concert at Lyle’s pub

BY CHLOE MORYL

Tommy Johnson '09 and his father, also Tommyjohne
son, share a lot of similarities: the same name, a passion
for the trumpet, and as ofMarch 4, they both have played
with Wynton Marsalis’ band.

The elder Johnson’s love of the trumpet comes from
humble beginnings7hoth selfttaught and classically
trained, Johnson started playing at the age of eight and
played his ﬁrst paid gig at the age of13.“When l was
13 they paid us two dollars to play at a National Guard
Armory,” he said. “We were in heaven and that’s when I
decided, hey, we need to play more mue
etc.”

The younger Johnson’s passion, on
the other hand, began as a result of his
dislike of cold weathcr7seriously. “In
the ﬁfth grade we had a choice where
we could have 30 minutes more of re-
eess or we could go do band," Johnson
said. “I love recess and I love basketball
but I think that it was wintertime and I
didn't like the cold and going outside so
I picked band and [my father] happened
to have another trumpet lying around.”

The senior chemistry tuajor contin-
ued to play trumpet throughout high
school. Hrs dcsrrc to excelprimaiily came
from an opportunity extended to him
bccausc ofhis father's musical prowess.
“in high school 1 wasn‘t that good but
my band director was obviously a (an of
[my rarherj and got me a spot in the symphonic band
which is the top band in our high school,"Johnson said.
“I was like, oh, wow—I should probably start practicing
so I don’t make a fool ofmyself."

Though both othis parents are piofessmnal musicians
and majored in music at collegelohnson decided not to
major in music, enjoying instead the relaxing quality of
playing the trumpet, both by himselfand with his dad.

I-Iis turner, however, once nearly had to stop playing
the trumpet. Four years ago, the elder Jonson developed
Bell’s Palsy in his (are, leaving rhc muscles in his race part
alyzedione ofthe worst fates for a trumpet player. After
not playing for a few months, and toying with switching
to the piano,Johnson discovered that if he held his lip in
position. he could still manage to play. “I knew I wasn’t
going to quit music when it happened but it was a shock
to my lifestyle,” he said, “But then I ﬁgured out, hey, if
I hold my lip 1 can get air to go through the horn and I
ended up staying with the trumpet because of it. it was
kind ofa eureka lnoment when I ﬁgured out I could do

this."

During the post-Marsalis concert in Lylc's Pub, the
elder Johnson, who drove to Grinnell from his home in
Lawrence, Kansas, used this technique in order to play
with his son and with Wynton Marsalis’ band. Though
the elder Johnson has played any of rhe same venues as
Marsalis, the two don’t know each other personally.

The elder Johnson first encountered Marsalis back in
1981 at ajazz consortium in Chicago, where the two end:
ed up playing on the same pinball machine in the lobby
of a hotel “He had just moslcd over and he seemed like
a nice kid and we didn’t think anything
ofit but four days later at the end of
the concert he was playing headliner
7he played at the end of the concert
andjust blew everybody away,"johnson
said. “And Columbia Records got him
on contract and were giving out his al-
bums which are collectois’ items now
given what he‘s done.”

Despite running in similar circles
mus.cally7“thn you travel csptt
cially in the jazz circles you tend to
run into the same people over and over
in different cities," the cldcr Johns
son said—neither Johnson had never
thought they would have the chance to
play with I\Iarsalis’ baud,

Though the younger Johnson was
performing with professional musit
c us, he said tllat lie was not anxious
about his pcrronnancc at Lyle’s “I wasn't that nervous be
cause I knew a lot of pcoplc in the audience so that made
it a litrle less nervewracking," he said. “But 1 mean, we're
jusr out there making music, you know?"

“He's not going to need to be nclvous from now on,”
his father added.

Mostly, thc younger Johnson is apprecranve otMarsa-
lis' hand for playing with a student group, and the Col:
lege, especially Rachel Bly, tor organizrng a postepcrfor:
mancc at Lyle’s Rub. “It was amazing that they can come
ro Grinnell and play with students like that," the younger
johnson said. “It was funny, because Brian cavanagh
Strong's ’09 busted—ass keyboard, it’s got that one key that
sticks the whole time. And I told the piano player and
during the show he kept on looking down like uhhhl

and both johnsons won’t forget playing with them.
