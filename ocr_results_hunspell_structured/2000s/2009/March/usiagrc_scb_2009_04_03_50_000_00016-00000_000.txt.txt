As peo le move on from the
basic simp e ste s of environmen-
talism, some are hound to get more
creative. More and more wacky ideas
are being roposed as ultimate and
unusual so utions to climate change.

According to Time, Agroplast, a
Denmark-based compan ,has come
up with the solution to p astic waste.
Instead of using plastic-based dis-
posable silverware and cups or even
vegetable-based ones (as the Grill
does f0l its cups), Agro last uses
pi urine to create a bio e radahle
so ution to the problem. es, you
lead that right—pig urine. They call
their com any a Human—Animal
Solutions quipment Biogas Cone
sultaney.

Agroplast not only provides a
solution for the replacement of none
biodegradable lastics but also aids
the agricultutr sector by consuming
a waste product that is both a bios
hazard and expensive in its disposal.

More on sub-free housing

The current debate on sub-net housing has
brought up an important question. Why does
sub—free housing exist? The Very existence of
it runs against self governance. I believe that
Grinncll students should learn to workout our is-
sues rather than isolate two groups with (littering
opinions. This lack ofworldng togethcrrcsults in
groups that can become polarized with sub-tree
students learning to only associate drinking with
being obnoxious and racking up dorm less and
extrcmi ' (like me) on the other end that assume
all Grinnc ians drink. After all, out there in the
relll world we will all have to live and work with
people with opposing opinions.

Also, asking Sourhics whether Cleveland or
Jame ould he silhrfree is like asking if you
would rather be shot in the .rrm or leg.

Someone spilled their coffee

After enjoying Frost/Nixon .rt Harris this past
Saturday afternoon, I reached down and picked up
the onpy orjean Baudtillald’s Passwords that 1 had
set on the ﬂoor beside me. Unfortunately. I was
greeted not with the book I had originally placed
there, but instead with .r “special edition" that came
pro-soaked wirh your coffee! I looked in rhe diree
tinn of the entree flow but alas, you were already-
gone. As it is a relatively rhia (and absorbent) book.
this particular copy has beon rendered essentially
useless by the liquid that has permeated it.Thougll
these circumstances would he unfortunate in any
Case. rl '- book happens to belong to Blu‘ljng Li~
harry. While 1 usually tend to visit the libl'aly so 1
may .woirl paying for a book 1 will read only once.
you have granted me an exciting opportunity: now
I get to pay for someone else’s copy of this book!
Thanks!
