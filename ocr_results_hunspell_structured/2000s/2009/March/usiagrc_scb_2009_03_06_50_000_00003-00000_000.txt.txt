Students join together to start regular queer Bible study

New group attracts diverse membership of students to study gender, sexuality and other issues in biblical scripture

av RACHEL FiELoS

In a country where the moral majority publicly opposes
the pursuit of gay rights, queer and religious issues might seem
strange bedfellows. This semester, the stonewall Resource
Center and the Gtinncll College Christian Fellowship aim to
change that perception.

on Sunday Feb 22, in the Sroncwali Resource Center, the
Center (or Religion, spirituality, and social Justice (CRSSJ)
and the Stonewall Resource Center (SRC) held the first ses-
sion of the CRSSJ/SRC Joint Bible Study Series, “The Bible,
Sexuality, and Relationship."Tlie discussion focused on homot
sexuality in the Hebrew Bible,

Leah Krandcl '09 and Brian Perbix v09 conceived of the
Bible study series as a way to engage dirrcront Grinncll com»
munities with an activity that would appeal to a wide range of
students.

“The CRSSJ/SRC Bible Study was conceived very natu-
rally through conversations with leaders at the SRC,” said Ree
ligious Life intern Katie Snipes. who oversees the discussions
with StoneCo leaders.“5ince there have been collaborative Bit
blc studies like this at Grinnell iii the past, I wanted to reenter
the conversation."

According to Stonewall Coalition co-lcader Jon Richard-
son '10, around 20 students came to the group’s ﬁrst discussion
on Sunday, Feb 22 and attendance remained relatively steady
for the second meeting this past Sunday, March 1. He said the
participants came from a variety orbackgrounds and faiths, in—
cluding Jewish students, GCCF members, and both religious
and nonereligious queer students.

“We spent time creating a safe space," Snipes said. “Both
religion and sexuality are intimate subjects, and it isvitnl to tree
are the space for dialogue first."

in a discussion about Sodom and Gomorrah, the group
talked about the relationship between homosexuality and pow—
er in the Old Testament. Students eventually concluded that
the distance between contemporary queer issues and the Old
Testament means that the text cannot address questions of 21st
century homosexuality.

Aside from education, the aim ofthe discussions is to foster
a sense of understanding between the two groups, Richardson
said. Rather than provoking a debate between students, the
group hopes to share ideas and work through the text together.

According to Richardson, the groups work is especially im»
portant in Grinnell,where the queerand religious communities
are often unintentionally opposed. “A lot of queer people on

campus feel rejected by Christianity. so that creates a kind of
warincss toward someone who's very Christian on this campus,"
he said. “And someone who's Christian might feel ostracized
from the mainstream Grinnell community To demystify the
notion of Christianity as an opposite value to Grinnell's values
is very cool.”

Richarson also said the discussions will aid queer students
in defending themselves against homophobic attacks based
on Christian texts. “Ultimately, after you leave this, you're not
going to really be convinced by someone with a banner that's
screaming hate speech at you,” he said. "You’re going to be a
little more sophisticated in your argument and your knowledge

ofscripture."
Brian Smith Y09, a leader of GCCF who also attended the

workshop, said that he hoped the series would help clear gen
eral misunderstandings about biblical scriptures basic messages
in regards to issues of gender and sexuality Smith said the first
reading, which centered around biblical passages about sodom
and Gomorrah, showed how biblical scripnrres’meanings have
deviated from what he behaves is their true message.

“They were traditional stories in the Bible that people use
to condemn homosexuality, but don't say Niall," Smith said.
"The stories are more about sex being used for oppression.”

The final discussion ‘in the series will take place at 8 pm. on
Sunday, March 8 in the SRC, and will handle how to deal with
contemporary “Christian" homophobia.

“To avoid such conhrsious,wc made a per

. STILL UP AND RUNNING

Go CATCH ITl

 

After a three-year hiatus, the Transgen—
dcr Advocacy Group (TAG) has returned to
campus under new leadership to open dis-
cussion on gender issues and provide transe
gender advocacy on campus.

This semester TAG cutleader Nikki
Jameson ’11 revived the group, which was
formed in 2005. to create a discussion space
for oransgender identity on campus, as well
as advocate for trans identity for the rest
of campus. Transgender represents a diver-
sion from one's gender assigned at birth, or
the roles enforced by society, and according
to Jameson, Gtinnell is largely unamte of
transgender issues on campus.

“A lot of people at Grinnell are «Seep?
ing, but there is not enough knowledge of
trans issues,"Jamcson said.

Co-leader Evan Hunsley’ll said TAG’s
primary goal is to educate the Grinnell
campus and the town of Grinneil about
the nation—wide transgender movement.
“Pragmatically, trans people have a really
hard time in the US. and in the world,
and that really needs to change,~ Hunslcy
said. “A great place to start that change is
at Gtinncll."

The group's leaders said they hopes to
ease tensions that may arise when students
discuss their gender. ”We would like to cret
ate a climate where people arerft offended-
by being asked their pronoun, because ask-
ing someone these types of questions are
not offensive,”]arneson said. “It is more of-
fcnsivc to come into the situation expecting
something."

In order to open up the discussion about

hope to collaborate with other student orga-
nizaLions to incorporate trans awareness in
campus events, such as Take Back the Night
Week, an annual nationwide protest against
rape and genderebased violence. Hunsley
said that the group would look forward to
“showing movies, leading discussions [and]
bringing speakers to campus."

Besides raising awareness about trans is-
sues,TAG also serves as a support group {or
any students interested in gender issues, es—
pecially students who are trans individuals.

Colin Booth ’11 realized that he was a
transgendet individual last summer, and has
found TAG to be a supportive Space in an
often judgmental world. “It’s great to have
a support group here—there are peoplc
who understand where I am coming from
and share my evperiences," Booth said. ”It
is good to know there are people here for

on.’

y Hunsley said that the group is one of a
number of organizations on campus for Suit
dents to talk freely reyrdirig gender iden»
tities and constructions. By ottering a safe
space, the group hopes to reach out to those
who may otherwise feel uncomfortable dis-
cussing tlieir gender.

“Trans issues can be very difficult to talk
about for u-ansgentler and [nonettansgene
det] folk," Hunsley said. “There aren‘t many
spaces in which that kind of discussion is
held confidentially and operay."

TAG mccts every other Sunday at 9 p.m.
in the SRC. The not; meeting is Sunday,
March 8.
