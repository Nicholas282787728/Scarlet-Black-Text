With the Iowa winter in full throttle
and students still making thcir way on to
campus the Grinnell College men's basket
ball team entertained a couple of confers
cnce fees in Darby, losing two erueialgames
by slim margins this past weekend, first to
Carroll University and then to nationally
ranked st. Norbert College.

Early in the game against Carroll, things
looked i)iCI\i( for the Pioneers, as they found
themselves down by 21 points early in the
second half. However, streaky shooting by
Matt Chalupa '12, Bobby Long '09, and
John Grothetg '09 brought the Pioneers
withrn inches of victory, The lead was too
much and the Pioneers
lost 108-102

Tire Pioneers mainly
attribute their struggle
against Carroll to mental
unpreparedness. “At home
when we played them we
came out a little ﬂat, just
not rnentally ready." said
Ross Preston ’10.

The high scorer against
cartell, Chalupa also de
livcred a similar senti-
mcnt. “This weekend we just need to get
ready to play," Chalupa said. “The first half
we were so dead and there was no energy in
the gym,"

As a result of this mental slippage, the
Pioneers fell behind and missed many shots.
“Ifyou look at what we shot from the three,
it was piss-poor,” Preston said.

Despite the hard-fought loss, the
Grinnell men went into the second night,

”This weekend we jusl rleed to
gel ready to play, [he first half
we were 50 dead and Illere was
no energy in the gym.”

facing St. Norbert, who are ranked 17th na-
tionnlly, in high spirits. “It was interesting
because they are nationally ranked and unr
defeated in our conference, but they haven't
won on our court in a while,” Preston said.
“It wasn't like they were a heavy favorite."

These high spirits certainly manifested
themselves on the court, as the high scor-
rng, typical of the Pioneer's "system" style
of play, returned to the court. Grotberg and
Long scored 2e and 25 points, respectively,
while David Arsencault ‘09 contributed 19
points and five assists.

But the return of their offensive pfOW’
ess wasn't enough for the Pioneers. The
game was tight throughout, during which
the largest margin of
difference had been
four points until St.
Norbert put together a
triumphant streak of 14
straight points. going
on to win107796.

Even with these two
close games, the Pior
neers remain optimis—
tic for their upcoming
games. "Last weekend
was a lost opportunity,"
Preston said. “But this weekend is a chance
to rectify those mistakes."

The men’s team is now 572 in conference
play and 8-5 overall, fourth in conferencci
the top four teams make the conference
tournament. This weekend, the men are
on the road, playing Lawrence University
on FridayJan 23, and have another shot at
Carroll University on Saturday, Jan 24.

This past weekend, the Gtinnell Womr
en's basketball team faced two of their
toughest conference opponents, Carroll
Universrty and st. Norbert College.Though
both were hard fought games, the Pioneers
fell to Calroll 86-57 and then to St. Norbert
72751.

On Friday, the Pioneers opened with
forward Jessica Shotts ’10 scoring the first
frve pornts ofthe game. However, their lead
didn’t last long. as Carroll scored the next
nine points, endrng the halfwrrh a 21-point
lead, “In the first half we
had a lot of defensive
lapses," Shorts said.

Along with the de-
fensive lapses. the team
had trouble keeping pOSr
session of the ball. “We
didn’t lose because they
had some kind of stand
out performance, we just
didn’t play well," said for
ward Mallory schatf ’11.
“There were 37»ttlrnovci‘s.”

Though disappointing defensive play
and poor handling may have decided the
game individual offensive play was solid.
An injured Jodi Watkins '09 was the top
scorer, with 14 points, with center Jessica
Vaverkn ’11 close behind her with 11, and
Shotts with 10.

st, Norbert, though a closer game in
numbers, presented more of a challenge to
the Pioneers. “It was a hard game, it got
violent,” Shotts said, "There were a lot of
fools against them and us, They're a really
scrappy team, really handsy."

The Pioneers began the game solidly,
garnering an early 12—11 lead early on.
However, the St. Norbert Gleen Knights
capitalized with a few good runs, putting
the Pioneers on the backhurner. ”VVe had
a good lead in the first half and they only
outscored us by one in the second half,” said
forward Emma Peterson
’10. “It's frustrating be-
cause we‘ll be right there
with them and then they'll
just pull itway.”By halftime
St. Norbert had pulled
ahead by 20 points and did
not look back.

Despite two tough
losses, the Pioneer women
remain optimistic. “Team
morale and attitude has
been o lot better in the past couple weeks,"
Scharr said. “The small successes along the
way have really helped lead to where we are
now.

The trim travels to Wisconsin this
weekend to face off against Lawrence Unl—
versity this Friday and Carroll University on
Saturday.
