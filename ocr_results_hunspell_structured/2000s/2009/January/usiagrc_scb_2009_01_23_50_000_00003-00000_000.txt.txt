President Russell K. Os-
good reported that, as of
November, the endowment had dropped up»
proximately 25 percent over the current trs-
eal year, In a series of letters, Osgood warned
there would be "budget strirrgeucy"ror several
years. While warning the school of the poten-
tral for future cuts in a campurwide letter, os-
good wrote that the College would prioritize
ﬁnancral aid, projecting an increase in the aid
budget of 55 million, or 16 percent, He also
wrote the College would "continue to invest in
our faculty and staff,” while slowing strategic
investment and capital projects, such as build
ing a new library. Osgood wrore the College
would allow some faculty and staff positions to
remain unﬁlled and decline laigc outlays that
were low»priority.

Politics:The Campus Democrats launched
an intensive gereout-the-vote effort, dissemi-
nating stacks of posters and campaign litera-
ture and stationing group members through-
out campus, cxllorting students to vote locally
and vote early. The campaign raised both
turnout and tempers as students voted at early
satellite voting locations on campus Though
much ofthe campaign events proceeded with»
out incident, some ofihose ballets would later
be challenged by members oi the Poweshiek
county Republicans, Their chdllcngcsithnt

The semester also brought a number or
high-pioﬁle speakers to campus, Former Sect
rotary orthe Navy Richard Dim g trumpeted
the security policies of an Obama adminisll'ir
tion,while movie star couple Demi Moore and
Ashton Kutchcr also stumped fat the dcanT

date who won the local seat in the Iowa Geno
eral Assembly, spoke with students; Republr
can Danny Cnrroil was notably absent. To help
commemorate the town’s commcmoiation of
Veteran's Day and honoring otworld War ll
veterans, the college hosted a speech and Inns

SGA: The new SGA begun with a rocky
start. Citing problems with communicar
tion ilnd institutional knowledge, SGA often
seemed uncertain of its role on campus. A

From p. 1

discrepancy ovei ballot counting procedures
in October tainted the results of the semester's
ﬁrst round of initiatives and communications
with the student body were initially inconsiss
tent.

As the semester progressed, however, suer
cess became more prevalent. SGA explored
revisions to policies on gas reimbursement and
cats in the dorms and, for the tirsr time ever,
secured a student position on the Commirree
for Academic Standing.

Sports: David Paige '09 began the year by
nearly swimming a marathon in the Obermill-
er Pool to raise awareness for Churcot-Maric-

disordei which Paige himselfhas.

The football team finished with its best
record in live years and the women's tennis
team lengthened their streak of consecutive
conference championships to rive. The men’s
cross country team won their conference meet
With a perfect score, the ﬁrst time a team has
achieved perfection since 1976. The team’s
success eventually carlied them all rhc way to
the national meet in Hanover, lnd.,where they
placed 26th.

Arts: student artists made a strong show
ing last semester. Brian Cnvannughrsrrong ’09
wrote and directed ’Il‘li‘l/L'IEV‘S’A Minimal in Dim
Art, in which we pcckcd into the worlds of
