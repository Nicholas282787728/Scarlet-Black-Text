BVJAl GARG

On Tuesday night, students, alumni, and administration
made the trek to Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines to view a
doubleheader featuring the Grinnell College men's basketball
team taking on Monmouth College and the
NBA DeLeaguc’s Iowa Energy taking on the
Tulsa 66ers.

Months earlier, the Iowa Energy invited
the Pioneers to participate in the doubles
header. Because Des Moines is almost an
hour away the student Alumni Association
along with Student Athletic Advisory Com-
mittee made sure that the students had transs
portation to and from the game,

Though technically a homo ngc for
the Pioneers, the comfort of Darby was re-
placed by the cavernous Wells Fargo Arena, which can hold
up to 17,000 fans on any given night, Despite the fact that this
was the ﬁrst time the Pioneers have played in downtown Des
Moines, both the team and the community came out in full
force.

“I was very impressed with the amount of students that

came to the game," said Bobby Long '09. "We were worried
with three minutes to go in the warm-ups and no one ms
there, but then hundreds of kids came in and they were really
enthusiastic."

According to Assistant Director of
Alumni Relations Daniel Mecue, 70 stu-
dents took the bus, and many more drove to
come cheer on the Pioneers. Including alums
ni. friends, and administration,wel.l over 200
Grinnellians attended the event. Gtinnellians
were not the only ones at the gamwaccords
ing to the Des Moines Register the overall
attendance was 3.229,

As for the game itself, the Pioneers show
cased why they lead the NCAA in points per
game. Shooting out to an 1172 lead, the Pine
noors took it 7547 lead into the hal£ By the time the game
was done, the Pioneers had easily defeated the Fighting Scots
122-79.

time scoring list, dropping 29 points, putting him only eight
points behind sixth on the list.

“I think we came out and played really well in the first half,"
Long said. “Everyone was knocking down shots, we got our-
selves an early lead and played good defense. The atmosphere
was cltcﬂ’lc7ﬂ encouraged a lot of us,"

Not only were Grinnellians treated to a night of exciting
basketball, but thanks to the Student Alumni Association and
other groups, they were invited to a delicious reception after
the game on the second ﬂoor of the Wells Fargo Arena. "We
reitlized there was an opportunity to bring the campus commu-
nity and Grinnell community in central lowa here together to
celebrate Gtinnell and the uniqueness of the system," McCue
said,

The reception, which was tree courtesy of the Student
Alumni Association, was held at the Principal River‘s Edge
Restaurant and gave Grinnellians a birdeeye view of the Iowa
Energy vs. Tulsa ooors. With complimentary tickets to the
doubleheader and mi assortment of food items, many students
were glad they decided to make the journey, “I have a shitload
ofhomework to do tonight,"said Austin Frerick'lZ. “But it was
nice to take n break."
