TEMPERATURES this week, dropping as low as 32F on
Tuesday night, only ﬁve degrees warmer than that days
record low, according to weather.com. In addition, a freeze
warning went into effect on Wednesday night, bringing an
end to the growing season. The weather is expected to get

enough to keep students and staff irorn oWRESTLING IN
A 380-GALLON POOL 0F JELL-O last Saturday afternoon,
SGA’s Alerampus Events hosted the event with the help of
Facilities Management and Dining Services The IOWA
PEACE INSTITUTE’s board of directors agreed to merge with
Grinnell College ata board meeting on Sept. 23. The merger
includes a $650,000 giit to the college that will go toward
developing a peace studies program at the college. The
institute also plans to donate the building it now occupies,
located one block from campus President of the IPI, Greg
Buntz, said it's a "natural evolution for [the IPI] to look to
the college to carry on what we’re doing." Buntz added
that a merger with the college stabilizes the institute’s
precarious ﬁnancial base. ”It’s been extremely difﬁcult to
raise money in the economy we’re in," Euntz said. The IPI
was founded in 1986 to facilitate conflict resolution
throughout the state arrows, The proposed Peace Studies
program is scheduled to start in the fall semester or’ 2004.
