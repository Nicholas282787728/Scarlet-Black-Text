Why Kerry will win

if the presidential election

were held today, President

George W. Bush would wrn a

decisive victory, garnering 300

electoral votes to John Kerry’s

238. Since the Republican Na-

tional Convention, conserva-

tive pundits

have been writing incessantly on the likelihood

ofa Bush win. Even some moderates and liberals
shudder in fear as Election Day approaches.

However,I am here to say that all the hype of
a second Bush term is unfounded and that John
Kerry will not only win in November, but win
big.There are three reasons whyl am certain ofa
Kerry landslide.

First, Bush has much higher expectations
coming into the presidential debates this year as compared to 2000.
In 2000, popular perception was that Al Gore was a superb debater
and analytical thinker while Bush was little more than a bumbling
idiot. Because the threshold was set so low, when Bush was able to
articulate a few coherent sentences and rattle off the names of some
African leaders, suddenly he was viewed as disciplined and wells
versed on the issues. This time around, it is Kerry who faces low

lieve that this ideology should extend beyond the academic sphere,

and affect the actions that we take as individuals and as a student
body.

As a campus with a long'tcrm contract with the CocarCoia
company, Coke has exclusive rights to our dining halls, the tomm,
and beverage machines around campus. However, human rights
violations allegedly committed by Coca—Cola violate the spirit and
trust of the Grinnell College community.

In the past few years, worker advocates have raised serious con,
cerns about CocarCola’s human rights record in Colombia. Since
1989, nine union leaders from Coca-Cola plants have been mut-
dered by rightwing paramilitary forces, the most recent being just
ﬁve months ago. In a particularly egregious example, paramilitaries
entered a bottling plant and shot a union orgar
nizer, just a few weeks after the union had sper
cifically requested help from the plant managers
to ensure his safety. The paramilitary group AUC
has stated that they intend to kill union members
for inrertering on plant operatrons, and there is
evidence of collusion between local plant managr
ers and paramilitary groups,

In 2001, the Colombian National Food Workr
er’s Union, the United Steelworkers of America,
and the International Labor Rights Fund sued the
coca-cola corporation in Federal court, alleging its involvement
in a campaign of violent intimidation against the unionized work
force through paramilitary groups. Pressure put on the CocarCola
Company by human rights campaigners and by a number ofcolleges
canceling their contracts over the past year led Coca-Cola’s general
counsel, Deval Patrick, to publicly offer to send a contingent ofin-
dependent observers to inspect plants in Colombia.

According to the erxl'zllgmn Pm, Patrick’s efforts to organize
an independent investigation were torpedoed by CocarCola’s CEO,
and Patrick later resigned in disgust. In January 2004, the New York
City Council, representing one of the largest Colombian popular
tions in the United States, sent a fact finding mission to Colombia
to investigate allegations of human rights violations against Coca-
Cola workers.

Their delegation reported that,“It seems indisputable that Coca»
Cola workers have been systematically persecuted for their union
activity, It seems equally evident that the company has allowed if
not itself orchestrated the human rights violations of its workers,
and it has benefited economically from those violations, winch have
severely weakened the workers’ union and their bargaining power.”
The rcport concludes that Coca-Cola‘s “failure to protect its work-
ers even on company property, its refusal to investigrre persistent
allegations ofpayoffs to paramilitary leaders by plant managers, and
its unwillingness to share documentation that might demonstrate
otherwise leads the delegation to the conclusion that CocarCola is
complicit in the human rights abuses ofits workers in Colombrrt.“

expectations. People perceive hrm as a perpetual nip-ﬂopper who
is unable to articulate a firm stand on any issue. The debates will
provide him with the unique opportunity to make up ground by
dispelling these myths. Meanwhile, Bush is in the same precarious
position as Gore in 2000, where the only place left to go is down.

second, all politics is governed by one question: “is the country
headed in the right direction or offon the wrong track?"lfa majority
opt for the latter it is clear that there is an impetus
for change in the air. In spite of Bush's other high
poll numbers, 53 percent ofAmericans believe the
country is err on the wrong track. Historically,
such a high wrong track number has spelled doom
for rncumbcnr presidents. With a poorly performs
ing economy and violent insurgency in Iraq, the
political landscape will only become more ripe for
a major power realignment as the election nears.

Third, Bush's greatest asset, his folksy appeal
and warm personality, will not ﬁgure prominently in people's decie
sion for the next president. In a time ofpeace and prosperity, such as
in 2000, it is much easier to opt for personality above issues than it is
in a period ofdomestic hardship and international conflict, such as
in 2004, In the end, voters will take a long, hard look at the Bush and
Kerry platforms and realize that changing course is a safer strategy
than another four years of the slams quo.

off campus

While the violence in Colombia is perhaps the blackest mark
against CocarCoia, their behavior in other countries and in the
United States also deserves scrutiny. In India, community groups
are protesting Coca~Cola‘s depletion of groundwater supplies that
threaten a drought-prone region. In addition, Coca-Cola products
in India were recently found to have a pesticide content 30 times
greater than that allowed by the European Union. CocarCola plants
in Russia have been reprimanded for aggressively and illeglly crackr
ing down on unions. In the United States, CocarCola was forced to
pay out $200 million in compensation to some 2,000 black employr
ees for systematic discrimination in wages and promotion.

We believe that it is our responsibility to take a moral stand, and
that we deserve to have greater agency in deciding where our dollars
go. Because ofthis, we are joining the growing national movement
and initiating a campaign against Coke on this campus. As con,
sumers in a market economy, conscious consumption is one of the
most accessible and powerful tools we have to change the behavior
of companies. We want to put pressure on Coca-Cola to change
their policies, and to make it clear that consumers will not implicitly
condone their actions.

We want to draw attention to the campaign by organizing a
student boycott against CocarCola on campus.
The Grinnell student boycott policy was origl~
nally formed during campaigns against the apart-
heid government in south Africa. If 20 percent
of students sign on to a boycott petition, then the
student body will ofﬁcially take a stance ayinst
CocavCola. While this does not commit the ad
ministration to any particular action other then
labeling Coke machines in the dining halls, it
does provide us with leverage to end our school’s
contract with Coca»Cola when it expires in 2008.
A number ofour peer institutions including Carleton College, Lake
Forest College, and Bard College have already kicked Coke offtheir
campuses, and we believe that Grinnell should be a leader in this
cause. .

Back in 2001, after the administration signed the current Coca~
Cola contract without ﬁrst asking for student input, SGA passed
a resolution stating that, ”we, Grinnell college student Govern-
ment Association, demand student consultation and discussion in
corporate contracts to help the college promote ethical standards
as a consumer. Secondly, we demand that the campus community
be given the opportunity to reconsider a contract and terminate it
ifthe campus community, collectively, decides to do so.Thlrdly, we
demand, ifthis contract remains in effect, that not directly competr
ing products made by companies like Nannrcker Nectars remain in
the Forum Grill to givc students greater consumer choice."

We need to ensure this time that student voices are heard and
heeded and that we are allowed to consciously choose which comr
pany we support. In this coming semester, we will be organizrng
various awaleness-laising events on campus. We will be bringing a
spcakei- in a few weeks to help educate students on the issue.

We will also bc tabling at the forum, post ofﬁce, and dining halls
and selling cheaper and more socially responsible alternatives to
Coke'ro find out more aboutwhy we want to get Coke ottcamprrs,
