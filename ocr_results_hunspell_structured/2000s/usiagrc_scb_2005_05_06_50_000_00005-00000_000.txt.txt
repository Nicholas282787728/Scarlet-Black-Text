Grinnell genitals to take

center stage at ‘Monologues'

Students will perform original pieces about sexuality in the

"Grinnell Monologues,”

Bv SARA MIRK

The 12 performers/writers/orgimizers of the
Grinnell Monologues promise to talk ahout every-
thing every one else has been afraid withings like
orgasms, asexulllit'y, and sexual assault.

Inspired by Eve Ensler’s Vagina Malia/uglier, the
Grinnell Monologues participants wrote their own
short performance pieces based on “anything related
to any genitalia, which is a very broad subject," said
performer Amelia Koforrl ‘07, who wrote her piece

inspired by the Vagina Monologues

environment than Ensler’s femalerfocused work.

“Men are always like, ‘Why are there no penis
monologues?” said Kot’ord, “We wanted to make a
space available for issues related to rnon‘and women,
penises and vaginas,”

Regardless of what genitalia performers discuss,
the works will no doubt bring into the open tradi~
tionally tahoo issues such as sexual abuse and personal
sexual experiences,

The intent is to create a more open and honest

about penises.

standing in front ofa room full
of peers and displaying her most
personal thoughts will probably be
“nerveuncking,” admits Koford.

“I will probably try and forget
that I wrote it, [because] if1 think
too hard about the fact that its my
story, I might get embarrassed," she.
said.

Although the cast and crew

”People talk abpulrex all the [me
but it’s Uiually veiled lnjolres or
stereotypesili’s not talked-about
honest/y or frank/y”

is all female, one of the main goals of the Grinnell
Monologues was to create a more genderrinclusivc

perspective on these difficult subs
jeets.

“People talk about sex all the
time but it's usually veiled iu jokes
or Sleicotypcsiltvs not talked
about honestly or frankly,” says
Koford, who hopes the perfor—
mance will make other people feel
more able to talk about their own
feelings and experiences.

The Grinnell Monologues

Concerts committee hosts plethora of bands

Cake concert proves to be enjoyable

but a little too corporate

Ev CID STANDIFER

Start hearing everything up early in the semester, Take one
Concerts committee and some student requests and find three relar
tively welleknowu hands. Add 340,000, a complicated contract, a
venue, some publicity and sponsorship from Pontiac and Dentyne.
Let simmer for a few weeks.Then add Dining Services, student aft
{air-s personnel a production management team, security, a couple
of police officers, a handful ofstate troopers and over 700 students
Barring culinary disaster, the product should he one cake concert
in Grinnell.

This spring, SGA found itselfin luck with a large sum of rolls
over" money left from last semester. This meant that Concerts could
theoretically have a show the size of the Cake concert without cut-
ting back on other performances.

Concerts committee chair Brendan Baker thought that Cake
would Fit Grinnell's musical tastes well, “Cake stuck out to me be—
cause they’re a mainstream band that had some hits on the radio.”
yet...“ appeals to both people who are more particular about their
music tastes and people who...are more interested in mainstream
music,"

However, Cake came as a package deal with all the corporate
sponsorship the tour entailed. Virgin Megastores set up a “Village”
on Mac Field early in the afternoon that included games, karaoke,
hooths distributing free Dentyne gum and people handing out CD
advertisements that used scantilyrclad women to sell Axe deodorr
ant.

As for the concert itself, between the production team and the
audience inside, Harris was packed to within three people or its
maximum capacity. Early in the performance, Cake lead singer John
McCrea asked students to ignore the corporate sponsorship and m,
member that the band was here to “seive"Grinnell.ians, “We’re here
to play you music," he said. Despite the close quarters, fairs on the
periphery ofthe crowd still found room to jump and dance around,
and the main act managed to badger a good chunk of listeners to
croon along by appealing to the primitive nature of group singing
Apparently, however, Mccrac did not understand the primal in-
stinct that compels people to yell Free Bird!‘ at concerts.

Attendees who may not have been familiar with the band rep
ceivcd a crash course in Cake's most well-known ditties, and hard
core fans who have every word from every albtim memorized had
the chance to exercise their singealougskills in the company oflike-
minded musical brethren. Baker and Henry both called the event
essentially a success. “For the most part people who were at the show
enjoyed themselves,“ said Baker. “1 think [that] most people.,.just
ignored the corporate sponsorship aspect ofit."

SGA President Mark Henry said that “there were probably
mixed reviews, butI think that after one graduates,..thcre are some
things that stick out in your mind and 1 think this concert will hope
fully be one of those."

Baker said that one or two large concerts a year may be pos-
sihle in the future, hut ideally he would like to avoid other corporate
tours. “I really want it to be something that we take on ourselves
rather than something that is directed by a tour that is outside of the
artists themselves.”

The Books

Mixtures of sound carefully tread

melodic and discordant, rhythmless and
pounding.

Marah Mar

Music focuses on layered instrumen-
tation to create melodic songs that
range from delicate ﬁelds of sparsely
played notes to heavily textured walls
of sound.

The Books, a primarily instrumental
band, will perform with Marah Mar this
Tuesday in Gardner Lounge

By CID STANDIFER

The Books is one ofthc few bands in the music world today that
manages to be experimental and friendly at the same time. Unusual
sounds that might end up sounding discordant or disjointed in the
hands of less skilled or more aesthetically confrontational artists
find their ways into flowing melodies and smooth rhythms under
their gentle guidance.

To the great joy offraeeled Grinnellians, these relaxing, playful
tunes will be ﬁnding their way into Gardner Lounge on May 10,
right in time for “hell week."

The Books is primarily an instrumental hand, but keep in mind
that here the term “instrument" is used loosely, Aside from the
beautiful acoustic guitar and violin that crop up frequently in the
music, the hand uses keyhoards, tonal synthetic sounds, hand clap
ping, crow caws and a plethora of unidentiﬁed percussive instru-
ments. Butwhat they use isn’t as important as how they use it.

The Books‘guitarists make guitars do strange things,using techr

. niques that may have been thought up some time in the past by

some experimental composer out have rarely heen heard in main-
stream musie. Chords bend and pop in ways that will catch your ear
and your attention in “Enjoy Your Worries, You May Never Have
Them Again Notes seem to he recorded and layered hack into a
song out of phase to lend a ghostly echoing quality to songs like
'Excess Strausses.”

Even the lyrics of the songs function less as verhal communi»
cation and more as a simple vocal instrument. Often the hand gives
a song structure through the repetition of a single lilting, repeated
phrase, such as in “Lemon of Pink," the title track of their latest
album. In the song "Read, Eat, Sleep," 3 voice blends in with the
instrumentals, slowly spelling out the title.

In “Bonanza," someone quietly mutters words in a strange lair
guage in a tone that borders on melody. The song “PS" has no ins
strumentals and almost no real words. It is merely two people gig-
gling heautifnlly.

occasionally, The Books do use language for its own sake, but
usually not in lyric form. Instead, these sound like recordings taken
from another place, or perhaps performed by actors for the micro-
phone.

The introduction of “Motherless Bastard" uses a somewhat
shocking and confusing conversation between an anonymous man
and a little girl convinced that he’s her father to catch the listener's
attention before slipping into an otherwise innocuous instrumental
track.

Half the fun ofThe Books is that they toy with the aural unis
verse in new ways in almost every song. It’s the kind of experiment
that can keep you staring at the stage or your speakers with your
head cocked to one side and a smile that asks, “How on Earth did
they do that?”

But at the same time thatThe Books take their music out of the
ordinary, their mixtures of sound carefully tread the line between
crowded and spare, melodic and discordant. rhythmless and pound-
ing to stay comprehensible to your ear.
