so Lire Grinnellians too busy? For many, a
home football game repicsclits one quick stop
on it Saturday afternoon schedule of putting
offwork and hanging out with rrands.

“I had piior commitments,” said Chris
johnston 09, one of those who left at the half.
“They were made before I even thought chart
was going to the game.”

Besides, who besides the most hardcore
of football fans want to sit at a football game
tor three hours on a Saturday afternoon?
crinnelliaus with other priorities can come
for a half, get their ﬁll and take off,

Keith Brouhle, Economics, put the dilemr
ma in a straightforward perspective.

“If the beneﬁts are less than the costs,
than I should stay,” Brouhle said, “If not, then
I should go." With Grinnell's free admission
policy, students need a lot ofineentive to stay.

But given Grinncll's heavy workload,
Brouhle said “[one] shouldn't expect Grinnell
students,given the eypectations putiipon them,
to come out in droves tor a football garnc."

One other question must also be raised: is

anyone actually there for the football?

"1 left partly because everyone else leavcs,"
said Alan Driggs '11. “Going to the football
game is a social event, so ifno onc’s there,why
am I staying?"

In a sense, the football environment at
Grinnell is the same as most colleges: it’s there
for socializing. People come with their friends
to hang our, but unlike bigger schools, where
high admission piices and a more vibrant ilk
mosphere keep students in their seats, Grinnell
students aren't required to last the entire three
hours. So they leave, and in true Grinnell fashr
ion, no one cares.

“Normative behavior matters," said Lauia
Sinnett, Psychology “Ifa large number otsru-
dents do leave a game at halftime, then this

communicates that it's okay to leave. However,
if most students stay, and just a few go (and
if those few draw attention to themselves by
leaving), then others might be more likely
to stay The overwhelming norm is to stay
through the end,and this norm is made salient
by the counter normative behavior of the few
deserteis.”

It doesn't help that most Grinnellians just
don’t care about Division III football.

“If you look at a lot of the students on
this campus, they're not initially interested in
sports,"said Johnston.

Driggs echoed Johnston's comments. “You
get people there who have never seen football
before.” Look around an average game, and
you're bound to find students getting reading

ball game, in a sense, is mere background.

But at least it’s free, Would anyone go to

event~ifthey had to shell out cash?

“People who don't have an active sports in-
terest will still come somernncs to support the
team," said Johnston. "But [they] would not
come at all ifit was a pay event."

So whar does this mean for Grinnell
sports? Probably that school spirit will always
take a back seat to other activities. If students
come here expecting a raucous, Division Irrype
sports environment, they will be sorely disap-
pointed. Some Grinnellians may be addicted
to sports, but inostjust want ‘it in small doses,
