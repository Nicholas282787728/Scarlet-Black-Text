McDormnnd) yer bland sm ll own barber who finds
his one ehsnee ro gee rich quick—ail he needs is 310.000.
But his eollcerion merhod brings grave consequences.
It looks and feels so much like Dani/r Indemnity, or
orher classic ﬁlm noirs. while Pulp Fiction or Fargo my
be modern variarions on noir, rhis movie is authentic.
Roger peakins should win rhe einemarogrsphy 05v
ear for his work. The blacks. whires. and greys are rruly
astonishing, and all the classic ncirshors, like Venerinn
blinds and cigarcrre smoke. are used. The easr, includ-
ing James Gnndclﬁni and (he fast-mik-
ing Tony Shallioub. also excel. However,
rhe plor makes some quesrionnhle
