Giinnell's protesscrs are great and the student
body is fun. But if you ask me, the best pait about
going to collcgc here comcs once every tour ycars,
and it'll be here again
in loss than a year. The
Iowa Caucus, first made
relevant by the underdog
campaign ofprcsidential
candidate Jimmy Carter
back in the 70s, is the “
single most important
event in the nomination process for presidential cant
didatcs in both major political parties. In 2004, the
caucus inspired me to stay involved in politics. Irwas
that cool.

I got to shake caiididates'hands, and, more irnporr
tantly, the campaigns actually cared about getting his
dividual's support. The political circus I was watching
on CNN was actually happening outside my window,
and it seemed so much more YM/tlmt way.

I had always been a student otpolitics. burl never
considered myself an activist. The thought that the
eyes otrhc country and the world were watching us
in Iowa, though, convinced me that it ms worth get-
ting involved. And my spirits could only go up as I
watched my candidate, John Kerry, go from polling
numbers in the single digits to caucus winner in the
span ofonly a few months.

Over the next nine months, you‘ll get the chance
to meet candidates up close, and it may inspire you
to get involved in their campaign.
You should absolutely try it. It’s a
chance to work with some of the

Continuing to participate in those groups also gives
you a chance to interact wttli activists involved in the
other campaigns, which will help avoid any big car-
tights between your group and others.

~Cratt your own message when necessary. The
message that a candidate emphasizes in rural Iowa
generally may not be quite what Grinnell students
are looking tor. so make your own posters, and get
your message our however you can on campus. Of
course, you shouldn't represent your posters as ofﬁcial

events. Every time you deal with your campaigns campaign materials, not should you try to spread your

staff, ask for a candidate appear
ance. Not only will this mean that
you get to meet your candidate, but
it will also help gencrarcgnew sup»
porters on campus. A candidate
cannot Win campus support Wlth’

should make sure campaign staff
know that. And take whatever promotional materi-
als (posters, placards, buttons, pens, stickers, ttsliirts
and hats) they offer, whenever they otter them, They
are always in short supply.

-Maintain good lists. Collect supporter cards
and track who is supporting your campaign, who is
considering your candidate, and who is already com-
mitted to another candidate. Cultivate an email list
and table outside the dining hall to enlarge it. Keep
notes with as much detail on in»
dividual caucus-goers as possible.

mind. But don’t be stupid: ifyou
put something particularly contro-
versial or inane on your posters, it
will reﬂect poorly onyou and, par
tentially, the entire campaign.

‘Gct your supporters to the
caucus. The date ofthe caucuses is a week before stu-
dents go back to classes in January 2007, and it could
move earlier, campus Democrats is already working
on making sure students who want to can get back to
campus on time (although more student support for
this idea would probably help), but convincing your
supporters to come back earlier may be tricky, our
precinct gets a lot of delegates to the county and state
conventions, so anyone who stays will have an unusual
amount otswny. Persuade as many people as you can
to make it to the caucuses.

Ofcoursc, my advice makes the caucuses sound
more mechanical than they actually are. In the end,
there are no hurdtandtfast rules, and all bets are off.
You‘ll be emotionally invested, and some candidates
are going to lose. As long as you’re prepared for that,
get involved. The caucuses are a unique and inspiring
experience, and the morc involved you are, the more
rewarding it will be.

We don’t have to grow up that fast

When I heard that the 569’}? was
looking for a column from an alumnus,
lwasn't sure how to react. I suppose I
might be considered a suitable candi-

to find a theme.

As a result, I

can only clabt

orate on my continued indecisiveness.
Well, perhaps one should not describe
it in such a way. Instead, I should say
that I’ve spent the last two years trying
to avoid growing up. I have seriously
contemplated being a burn for a while;
just to see what it was like. Alas, burnt

Damn I’m old.

Well, this is the pointwhere alumni
are supposed to bestow their learned
experiences upon those who are soon
graduating, right? well, I didn't know
what to do after graduation, and after
two years I have not become particu-
larly learned. To be honest, I still don’t
know what to do after graduation. So
for those at you who suffer from the
same indecision, I would like to remind
you that there is no rush to grow up.
You’ll always have that very opportut

nity.
