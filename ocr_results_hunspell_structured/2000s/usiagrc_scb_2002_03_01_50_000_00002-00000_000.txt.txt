Mission statement

Professors speak about the document
approved last week by the Trustees

by Michael Andersen
Staff Writer

At their meeting inTcxns last weekend, Griniicll’s trust-
ees concluded a year otcrossearnpus debate by endorsing
Grrnnell's ﬁrst new mission statement in fifteen years. The
ﬁve sentence documenr, which had been completed by the
tacuiiy in mid February, may have been the first mission
statement in a generation to be subjected to rigorous tac.
ulty triricism.

The process began in February 200 1, when administrae
tots submitted a draft statement to the faculty's Etccutivc
Council, A number of Faculty members immediately obs
iected to its fern-I7: list of Four “core principles," and one
sentence each tor a “purpose" and “common goal."

“Bullet points often appear disconnected and slmpiiSv
tic." Sum Rebolsky. Computer Science, wrote at (h: timc.
“They counter the earerul reasoning, relating, and rational.
iry rhar characterirc liberal education."

“They had links to other mission statements,” Rebelsky
said of the administration’s draft. “And some of those were
inspiring."

In response ro such criticisms, the Executive Council
formed an ad-hoc faculty committee to tackle the issue.
Chaired by John stone. computer science, and including
Rebelsky and two other dissenters, the committee solicited
student advice through the Blackboard system and drew on
earlier srarcmenrs of purpose.

The rhreeaparagraph proposal was submitted to the
Executive Council, which condensed it into two sentences.

Reportedly in an errorr to prevent an impasse, faculty
chair Bob Grey appointed Don SmiLh, History, to tliair a
second taculty committee, which began the process again,
largely from scratch.

“I didn't want to be responsible for ooming up wirh a
mission statement that was in away a revision otsomehody
else’s," said Smith.

Grey, who is ill this week. was unavailable for comment.

This second committee ptoduoed, at last, the basis for
the sraremenr passed last weekend.

George Drake ‘56, History, who composed a mission
statement of his own during his time as college president
and sat on the second committee, praised Smith's chairman-
ship. Srriith opened the proposal to any faculty amendmeno
that were submitted bail/cm meetings.

“it was amuch more orderly procm than someone came
ing in saying, ‘Oh, by the way, have you ever thought or
this?” said Drake.

critics of the ﬁrst sraremenr expressed measured saris.
faction with the ﬁnal draft. “It’s quit: a good mission start:-
rnent," said stone, though he regretted what he saw as a
slight shift in focus from some earlier drafts.

“once it was in rhe hands of people I thought i could
trust," said Rebelsky, “I didn’t worry that much.”

see exactly how Dining services spends their money and then publish a
report that would be available to all the students."

Oyarrahal disagreed strongly with the proposal. “An audit would be
totally unnecessary,” he said. “It's oosdy, it‘s micromnnagemenr, and it's
unnecessary.” Pham and Pieper also expressed reservarions about the idea.

Pham said he would tocns on ways to improve strident lite, such as
sponsoring more ottcampus trips on weekends. “I rhink we detrniteiy
need to focus on rhings that will help the students while they’re actually at
Grinncll" as opposed to yust iong»tetm issues, he said.

Pham’s tocns drew criticism from one questioner, who asked whether
his proposals might not be better fitted for the strident services coordinae
tor. Pham responded that as president, hc would need ro have ideas to
bring to his cabinet.

VP candidates stick to academics

The three candidates for vice presidondpresident or academic affairs
chose to emphasize the academic role otrho vice president, pIrcing par.
ticular emphasis on developing Mentored Advanced Projects (MAPs)

Amos said that remodeling MAPs would he a cornerstone ofhis vice
presidency, “I can make this fundamental instrument for the advance.
ment orindependent learning a more crucial and integrated component
in the Grinnell academic sphere." he said, adding that the MAP option is
not well publicized.

“There are a lor of advanced projects," McGranaharr said, “bar the
idea ora MAP is unofﬁcial. We need to get that into the books."

Amer said he would push for a more diverse faculty and called tor
competitive salaries as a way to attract and keep professors from varied
backgrounds.

Yeung addressed the issue offacultysire, calling for more professors in
light ordie tact that MAPs would probably occupy proressors' attention
and cut into rhe number or classes they could reach per semester. He
portrayed himself as a “ﬁghter," pointing to his choirs to improve the
Norris computer lab and the student initiative he presented last semester
concerning food labeling by Dining services.

Mecranahan suggested expanding rhe student mentoring program
currently used in the science division to the rest otthe college. one ofthe
things that got me through biology, and chemistry especially. was the
mentoring program," he recalled. “There is a student in there who is rak-
ing notes, listening to the same lecture that you are. and they have weekly,
biweekly meetings [with students who need help] Why can’t that
mentoring program be applied to the oLher two divisions?"

Arries is in his second semesteras the senaror from James. Yeung was a
Norris senator last semester and has served on the History department
SEPC and various other committees. McGrznzlian, like Amcs, has spent
two semesters as a senator, and also coordinates the Middle School Men-
tors program.

The candidates for president and vice president will square ott again
