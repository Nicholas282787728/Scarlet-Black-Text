Far Away: crazy world

by Lau ren Standifer

Far Away is a yourney inro a disturbingly chaotic world that rakes
place in the far ﬂung future. "It is about, in a sense, the end ofthe world,"
said director Chris Connelly. In a demented universe that becomessrranger
and scarier as the play goes on, the ultimate world war is rearing apart the
planar around rho characters. Even the most innocenr people he and com»
mit atrocities. Children under Five and at: become threas that must be
eliminated, and the entire production is immersed in a paranoid, sus-
penserul atmosphere,

Elinbeth Kruger. rhe plays srage manager. is relueranr ro give away
much of rho storyline, “[l warn] people to be able ro experience ir for
rhemselves," she said, The secrecy ofthe play is a major factor in creating
rho mood. No bit ofinformarion is given away without a ﬁght and it's up
to rhe audience to carch clues about whar is going on and put rho pieces

tion, so it’s also been a challenge For even the as! to make sense ofwhat's
actually supposed to be happcnlng on stage.

The set is very minimalist, The only pieces of iurniruro are a massive
dining table with chairs or benchcs around it. The background consists of
a large window behind and to the side or rhe stag: area. The horrors rhe
characters see outside is left to the audiences’ imagination. The bleak sets
ring is enhanced by the Flanagan Theater in Bucksbaum, which is assent
tially a giant black box. The audience sits on three sides, creating the illu-
sion that the action of rho play is trapped in a riny dark space, In a parade
scene In the middle orrhe ploy, Connolly makes use orall the sparial levels
afforded by the rhearers gallery: rhe wire ner under rho ceiling and rho trap
door beneath the ﬂOOL Prisoners in holocaust garb and extravagant hats
march slowly around, above and below the audience like a nigh tmar:,
while an incongruous parade march plays on rho sound system. Almost
constant eerie background musrc contributes to rhe nightmarish milieu.
The actual setting is never speciﬁed; it could rake place nowhere, or in

your hometown.

There are only rlrree enamorers in rho play, excluding rhe anonymous
prisoners in the parade. Their names are given in rhescrrpr usTodd, Harper
and Joan, bur rhey are never menrioned on stage by name Harper, the
ﬁrst characrer to appear, is played by Lara Jansen. Innson described Harper
is someone who “has become fed up wirlr rhe way rho world is end de-
cides ro rske ernon." But the wayshe goes abour irsccms horriﬁc at times,
though in the Context orrhe new world, her acrrons seem less extreme.
Joan, played by Dale Mackey, rr-ensforms from child to adulr over rho
course orrhe play. In the first scene she is a seemingly rnnoconr nine-year-
old who asks questions rhar bring terrible rrurlrs to rho surrrce. In rho next
scene, Joan has gmduated college, bur has apparently maintained her nae

nois end violence orrhe world have taken then roll on her. Mnckey said
rharJonn “illusrrares rhar rhe world around [her] is changing a lot and that
rherc's really no safe place." Todd (Darryl Neufeld) is a much more cryptic
char—ester. At times he displays innocence in his relarionship with Jean,
bur references ro his life spurt from her make him add u callous dimension
to his personality. None oirhe characters can be labeled heroes orvrllains.
bur according to Jensen, “The whole poinr or each character is that you're
nor supposed ro know who you're with or who you're ngainsr."

wroro back saying he was interested and had been meaning to get in touch
with us," -

“Next rhrng we knew, we were rcociving a plethora ore—mails." said
ley Wicsner '05.

For the two weeks error the plans were set, rhe GeToncs practiced both
old and new songs, including Gtinnell hymns that Leach said were “not
complicated, just took time."

At 3:30 a.m. on Saturday morning, rhc group left Grinnell ro mtch its

“When is Cam: ro our sruir, people really liked it," said Wiesner, "The

The G-Tones remain optimistic about similar future opportunities

Young, Gifted and Black Gospel Choir
Saturday, Nov. 22

.Sebring-Lewis Hall

Thirty seven years ago, six liLack students come
together in Vounker Fit in hopes or starting their own
gospel choir When this group ofﬁcially formed urinnell's
Young, Gifted and Black Gospel Choir in 1971, the group
only had seven members. Numbers grew over the years
and in past years membership tolls ﬂuctuated between
the ’20: and the ‘305. Today, VGE tontinues the tradition
or ministny through music, but the gmup bears little
semblance to its 1967 predecessor.

This years group has ﬁftyrthree members, making it
the largest their in the history of YGB. Vvonne Palm he,
the group's student director who conducts the chorus
during performances, welcomes the increased size, ”It's
much easier for the soprano and tenor sections; people
don’t have to strain their voices to sing out, as they had
to last year,” said Palm. ”with a large group, its also
easier to sing higher notes," she added.

As the size of the group increases, so does its
popularity. By spreading its mission in the multicultural
newsletter. it has attracted the attention of the
community and prospective students alike.

"We've gone from being in Sebrirlg Lewis with a halt-
full audience to singing in trout or a crowd that is
standing-room only,” said Michael Sims, Dean of
Multicultural Affairs and adviser to the group.

The new director, Barry Jones, may be partially
responsible for large membership tolls and the increased
fan-base that YGB has experienced this semester. When
Ralph Russell, VGB'S previous director, was on sabbatical
in the spring of 2000, Jones, then the director of the
Shiloh Missionary Baptist Gospel Choir in Des Moines,
helped keep the group rolling Throughout the past
several years, Jones has often served as a guest
perrormer with the group and directed several songs with
them. Jones is ﬁlling in during the 2003-2004 academic
year while Russell serves as the Visiting Professor of
Music at the University of Northern Kentucky.

Jones' enthusiasm has motivated the group to tackle
songs at a rapid pats. ”We are teaming more songs this
semester than we learned [during] both semesters of last
year,” said Palm. ”[But] rehearsals are really fun," she
added, "because Baily is laid-back and funny, but he
does get the job done."

The group will need to learn many songs for their
annual tour during the first week of spring break. Unlike
its predecessor, in the past years VGE has not limited its
ministry to the Grinnell Community, but has traveled
across the Midwest and the deep South. During this
years ﬁvedaytrip, they will travel throughout Ohio and
Northern Kentucky, singing in a variety of location; In
the past they have sung at schools, churches, nursing
homes and even a penitentiary. They will also have the
opportunity to visit Russell.

Though the Grinnell gospel chairs of the '605 and early
’70: did not have many venues in which to share their
music in Grinnell, YGB now has a wide range of
opportunities to sing for the community. They already
performed several times this year, singing a few numbers
with the Soul Clinic Ambassadors fmill Ghana, and twice
providing the music for "blank church," a service open to
all community members held on the setohd Sunday of
each month. VGB performs its first concert of the year
this Saturday at 4 porn. in Sebnngdewis, The concert will
feature new songs as well as old favorites. The selections
includes ”1 Need you to Survive," by Hezekiah Walker and
the Love Fellowship Choir and three pieces by Joe Pace,
including the group’s favorite song, "Shake the
Foundation.”

Deyo Johnson '07 hopes that VGE will stay true to its
original purpose, that students will gain a better
understanding of the message tarried by VGB by
attending Sanirday's concert. “People will listen to
quality music," he said “and if you have their attention,
they can pick up on the meaning ofthe songs and pick
up on the ministry.”
