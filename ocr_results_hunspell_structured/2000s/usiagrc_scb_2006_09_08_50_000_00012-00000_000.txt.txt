Learn from your elders!

For those of’you who haven‘t heard, I‘m here to
tell you about the latest trend at Grinnell: for grithF
ates to stay at Grinnell well past their graduation. At
least this is what comes to mind when 1 see the many
graduates who are determined to stay at Grinnell.
Apparently. for sonic, four years spent here in pursuit
of a degree was just not enough. Whether Imposing
themselves at senior oft Campus parties or making
moves on unsuspectlno first years at Harris rlieyre
teaching us a lesson. fake note, dent become them.

_ Importnnily, they're leading by example-an example
that we would do well not to follow. These graduates
are well past their heyday andare now moving onto
sketchy As such, they should save themselves the em-
barrassment and move on. To put it nicely: Get out!
Leave! Peace! Be gone!

Students speak
about what’s on
their minds in
142 words or less,
and you’re in-
vited! If you have
a rant, e—mail it to

plaining in a public
forum is always
more fun than do-
ing it alone.

Nostalgia for imperfection
Don't get me wrong: I appreciate the work that
has gone into the campus center. The building is
new, centralized and spacious. The problem is that
when l think ahout the campus spaces 1 loved last
yoar,l didn't love them for any of those reasons. Be-
cause the places we remember arc the places with pet-
sonalityithe plac‘es with writing on the bathroom
walls With wohhly tables, noisy tans and ridiculous
locations. Maybe that sort or thing comes only with
time- I dont know. But right now,I would gladly trade
in buil in computer screens and combination locks
rot eating Grah ri Go on Cleveland Beacht have a
feeling the latter would just make a better memory.

Comg back to kindergarten
When I walk towards the dining hall, I often
see piles of backpacks strewn across the ﬂoor dur»
ing peak meal times. Not much or a change rrorn
Cowles and Quid, and the lack ofstoragc space is
one more thing to complain about with my friends
the next time we discuss the new building. But wait!
As 1 inch further up in the line, I can see. that the
nice little cubhy area is full or empty tuhhies — or
worsc, even more backpacks sitting on the ﬂoor
just inches away from their own kindergarten style
boxes. Come on, Grinnellians. I know our time is
precious, but we aren't that lazy. It's not that hard
to step out orline .md stash your bag like a big kid.
Trash the campus center all you want conveisation»
only, but lets keep it clean.
