tudents share struggles with depression

av Assv RAPOPORT

She'd had periods of sadness
before but nothin like this. After
12 hours of sleep, s ewoke up tired.
If she made it to class, she went
without her read-
ing and felt stupid
throughout the pe-
riod. Afterwards,
she headed back
to her room to nap
for five hours, miss
ing lunch, class and
work. She went to
dinner and then
avoided her room,wandering around
the librar without getting anything
done. Then, exhausted she went
back to sleep.

Ste hanie Rosenbaum '08 suf»
fered rom undiagnosed clinical
depression until four months a 0,
when she sou ht hel from t e
Mental Health%enter. ast semesr
ter, she gained weight after personal
problems at home and at school
pushed her to what she referred to
as excessive partying. Durin winter
break, she oun rerself a ienated
and unhapp about her body and
her lace at érinnell.

osenbaum’s friends urged her to

ct hel ”It’s hard to see your friends

eal With that," she said. “It’s not

fun to be around someone who’s
depressed all the time.”

After one friend discussed her
concerns about Stephanie with an
RLC, the RLC and another member
of Student Affairs met her coming
out of class and discussed options
for treatment in Grinnell.

Rosenbaum was ready to et help.
“I ﬁnally was just so tired o feeling
sad," she said.

For some, depression has more

the time.”

Stephanie Rosenbaum ’08,

obvious roots. Jane '08, who request»
ed her name be changed to protect
her privacy, first came to grips with
depression after September 11. “It
was just the first time everyone
was consumed with
grief," she said. “It
unlocked all this
griefl’d been hold-
in since I was a
litt e kid."

Jane’s fa-
ther died when she
was young, but she
mourned for four
days before starting a summer of
distractions from grief. It was only
with the outpouring of emotion
during 9/11 thatlane began to face
her own sadness.

The next year, Jane began her
freshman year at
a colle e in New
York. y second
semester, she ha
to withdraw for
emotional reasons,
intending1 to be in
workingt rou h ier
depression at ome.
Instead, “I rett
much lied in 1bed or four months,”
she said. “I was drowning."

In the fall she began school again
and be an to see the cycle beginning
again, ut this time, she decided to
get more treatment. “I thought I
was dealin with things but I barely
scratched tie surface, she said.

By the time she transferred to
Grinnell, Jane was determined to
make it throu h the semester. “[My
family] eoul n't afford another
semester‘s worth of tuition down the
drain," she said.

And so, three semesters later,

”People [at Grime/i] are way
more Mast/ant about ihe/rprabs
/mes than the genera/ norm”

she erseveres, still wrestling with
the epression that gets better and
worse depending on circumstances.
Jane described a da of her de ms,
sion: “Eat. Grieve. ﬁrink. Go ack
to sleep."

Rosenbaum and Jane both find
that de ression is all the more diffh
cult to eal with in colle e,where aee
ademic and extracurricu ar demands
can become overwhelming. “You
don’t have energy to do anything,"
said Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum's
classwork was one ofthe ﬁrst things
to go when she began suffering from
depressions.

“The anxiety of fucking up in
school becomes its own animal,’ said
jane,who has had to take Emergene
cV Credit Reduction this semester to
alleviate some of the stress.

Jane and Rosen—
baum found their friends to be
supportive and helpful. “People [at
Grinnell] are way more u -front
about their problems than t e gen—
eral norm," said Jane.

But des ire these optiorrs,Jane
and Rosenbaum a tee that it can
be difﬁcult to seek elp. “[Walk in]
requires a huge amount ofpersonal
initiative," said Jane, who asked a
friend to accom any her to the
health center for t era y.

dlin on their own,”s e said.

etting academic accommoda—
tions from professors can make
the situation easier, but can also be
difﬁcult to demand. “I don’t want to
be that girl who uses her depression
as a Get Out ofJail Free Card,"said
Rosenbaum.

Jane has found that talking to
professors blurs lines between her
academic career and personal life.
"Our relationships to our professors
are supposed to e rofessional but
at the same time, sc 001 is ourlives,”
she said.

ForJane and Rosenbaum, school
has been both help and a hindrance
in co ing with depression. For
Rosen sum, the treatment she gets
here and the su port from friends
has left her conﬁdent that she will
never sink to the same level of den
pression she faced earlier this semese
ter. “I know that with the help I’m
getting it‘s not going to get as bad
as it was before, she said.

But still, she worries about what

eoplc who don't know her Well
will think. “People who ctceive me
as a normal person don’t want
my reputation [with them] to be
tainted," she said.

lane is similarly ambivalent. “I’ve
felt the whole sup ort network be»
neath me," she sai . “Teachers have
been really, sympathetic and really
supgortivc.”

utIlane is left not knowin how
she wil handle later life. ”lVl ife is
such a circus, such a farcicalcircus
I am terriﬁed this is not gain to
go away,"she said. “I can’t tell i ife
is good, ever."
