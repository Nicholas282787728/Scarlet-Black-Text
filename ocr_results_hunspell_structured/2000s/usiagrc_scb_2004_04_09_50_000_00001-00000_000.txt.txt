Back from Iraq

Derrick Mitchell, who entered Grinnell with the class of 2005, visits campus
after returning from sewing in the National Guard in the Middle East

by Ben Weyl

ln lsre January 2005, Derrick Mirchell, originally a
membel ofrlre class ofzoos, gor a call saying he should
prepare ro leave his family and ﬁiends for deploymcnr
ro rhe Middle Easr. A few weeks Iarer, he was in Fort
McCoy, Wyo., undergoing training ro be a medic as well
as to defend Itimsclfin case of an ambush. After the
rralningsessions he ﬂew to Mosul, lraq, where he stayed
unril late March 2004 when he re
turned holrle.

Mitchell had orrgrnallysigucd up

ro help pay for college. Ar rhc time,
he doubted he would actually be
called rrp ro serve, brrr he knew rhe
possibiliry existed.

While in lmq, Mitchell was a “91
Whiskey," a :ombar medic, Mitchell
said he and his realn provided all rhe
medical aid [o the sled around Mosul,
lraq, which en railed rho uorrhern sec»
rion ofrbe counrry. Furthermore,
only on: hospital existed in the norrhern secrron, so all
ofrhose who needed aid wenr directly to that area.

As a combat medic, Mrrchell performed many iohs,

ing of wounded soldiers, and he was a member of the
ambulance crew, which evacuated wounded troops from
rhe ground or from helrcoprer transfers. “Most of rhe
ambulance work was for soldiers or lraqis rhar were driv»
ing and were hir by an ambush." he said. “Most ambu-
lance calls were very serious."

Mitchell worked for 12 hours a day and had 12 hours
of“free rirne," which he orren used ro sleep. When he

rhar occupred Mirchell's rirne was rhe Unrred service

The day-roday condirions were nor grear for

Mirchcll. From April 2003 until this pasr January, he

lived in a 35.person rcnr wirh no

was a welcome change. The food
from rhe drnmg hall was nor very
good. according ro Mrrchell, but
somerirnes he are local lraqi food, s
“which was good, but made you
sick.”

His rnreracrion with rhe local lrar
qis was nor very esrensive, Mirchell
said, ercepr for occasional visirs to
some of the stores rhey owned. “lr
was hard ro ger close ro rhem, because rhere was a rrusr
rssue," Mitchell said, referring ro rhe army's warning of
interaction hcrween rroops and Iraqis. snll, he became
friendly with a few Iraqis—mostly Kurds, he said, who
inlrahir rhe norrhern region where he sraycd_rhrough
sign language and picrures, Few spoke English.

Alrhough his oneeonrone interactions were slightly
limircd, Mrrchell said most ofrhe iraqis he encounrered
had a positive reacrion ro rhe American presence. “The
locals were very grateful. There was a sense ofhope," he
said.

But rhar sense ofhope did nor extend to all Iraqis.
Many vehemenrly wanted rhe American rroops gone.
