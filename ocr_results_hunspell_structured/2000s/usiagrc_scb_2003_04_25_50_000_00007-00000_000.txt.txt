Concert P evlew

Young, Gifted, and Black Gospel Choir
Ralph Russell, Director

Saturday, April 26 at 2 phi.
Sebrlng-Lewis

Forty voices strong, the Young Gifted and Black
Gospel chair will take to the stage of Sebring-Lewis in
what Associal Dean of student Life Michael sims
ternred a “gospel extravaganza" this Saturday at 2 pm.

The VGB gospel Choir had its beginnings in the late
1960‘s when ﬁve or six students came together to form
a spiritual group. students began to find comfort and
support in the group and overtime it grew into the
group that today perrorrns, not only In Grinnell, but all
over the country

Saturdays concert looks to he a very special
experience for all involved, ‘IGB will be singing 8-10
songs ranging from traditional spirituals to
contemporary gospel music. Saturdays repertoire will
include ”Glory to GMT by Fred hammond, "Expect
Your Miracle" by Twinkie Clark, “He Reigns" by Kirk
Franklin, and "Real” by Diane White, a guest artist who
has worked with YGB in the past.

In addition to White, three other Gospel Choirs will
her‘ ning ‘IGB this Saturday: the Shiloh Baptist Gospel
Choir from Des Moines, the Washington High School
choir from Cedar Rapids, and the Sam Mack and the
Fellowship Chorale from Davenport.

When director Ralph Russell was on sabbatical}
years ago the director of the shiloh Baptist Gospel
Choir, Earry Jones, stepped in to help Russell keep the
group rolling. The two men managed to put together a
concert that year in spite of the net that Russell was
in Chicago for a fair amount of the year.

Marlene Jacks, Admissions, sings with the 5am Mack
and the rellowship Chorale. Washington High School’s
participation is important to vcb because the outreach
is an example of the kind of service that YGB offers.

By reaching out to other groups “the choir is
putting into practice the mission of the college," said
Russell, ”to serve} to help the less fortunate.”

Such service has long been a facus of the choir. Each
spring break the choir goes on tour, visiting schools,
churches, nursing homes, and on the most recent tour,
a penitentiary. This work is important to the choir
because it not only helps others who may not have
access to such ministry, but it also educates the choir
members by exposing them to a wide variety of
backgrounds.

"The tour was the bomb!" said Johnathan Smith '03,
assistant director and participant of YGB. ”Not only
were the audiences touched, but they touched us,"

Saturdays concert looks to be another mucking and
emotional experience in the words of Marieta Fall ’03,
Joseph Oppong ’03, and Smith For these three
members, Saturday will be their last chance to sing
with VGB.

“It’s like a homecoming tor everyone," said Smith of
all those coming together for the concert who have
helped over the years. “It’s going to be an emotional
concert because we all have such strong ties...We've
really solidiﬁed into a emily group."

The group has grown in numbers and strength over
the past four years since Russell took over the group.
YGE is a diverse group of students from many different
countries and racial and ethnic backgrounds Having
people from so many different places "really adds to
the culture or the group" said oopong.

Finally, the concert will he specialto many because
it. is dedicated to Derrick Mitchell '05 who is currently
sewing with the Army reserves.

"He was such a strong contributor to the chair," said
Smith. ”he just brought so much life to the chp .
want to show] how important he is to us and that we
miss him,”

Real life theatre

Balancing theatrical skills with the representation of historical ﬁgures proves tough for east

by Elisa Lenssen

When Margo Gray ‘05 was trying to choose a play to direct. she looked
for one with meaning relmnr to herself.

1 RM in Fbmc, Cried 2/7: l’l/omixt by Tennessee Williams, is about an
individuals role as :rrisl and person. Gray selected ir for [his reason, and
rhc show runs tonight at 7 pm. in rhc Wall Performance Lab.

Specifmlly, the play is a ncrional account of the last afternoon and
evening in the life of author DH. Lawrence. Contradictions deﬁne
Lawrenze's roles as artist, husband, and friend, and by obscuring these
eonrradredons rhe play highlights the overlapping relationships among
drese roles. Jelfryes plays Lawrence, lam Jansen ‘05 his wife Frieda, and
Juliette Muslu '05 Brett, Lawrence's intellectual com»
panion and follower.

”The relationship [of the
characters] is really hot-
cold. They both have a
lot of passion and it’s
difﬁcult for college-aged
actors to do passion that
isn’t young passion."
—Margo Gray ’05

Director, characters, actors

Gray is directing the play to ﬁrlﬂll a requirement
for her [heater majors required 300-lcvel directing
class. She chose [Ritz because ofits themes, but also
for technical reasons lrke its small cost sire, length,
and minimal spccrai chfccrs.

In the plry, Lawrence wrestles with how the
massesseem r0 misunderstand lus writings undwirh
miscommunicanons in his interpersonal relation.
ships As Jeffrycs explarned, Lawrence “realizes
rharlhis] writing can't be apprecrorcd for what rr truly
is now [in 1929] due to socrol construcLs, bur that m
the future people will undersnndx'

The relationship or the heart of the play, between Lawrence and his
wife. is also difﬁcult to understand, for both an audience and the actors.
“The relationship is really hot-cold," said Gray. "They both have a lot of
passion and it's dimcult for collegedged actors to do passion that isn'r
young passion"

Over 20 college students auditioned for die play's drree roles. The de»
cision was “really. really tough," said Gray. But she is more than satisﬁed
with her cast. “The acrols have been doing a great job," she said. "They’re
all IMIZysmarr Sometimes people underrare intelligence in an actor."

When fiction meets fact

An ability to extract and inrcrpolare historical and rhezrriul facts has
been very important to this production. “it's dlmculr to play roles that are
real people." Gray surd, “npccially lawrenoo and Frieda."

To get a berm: or at least broader grasp ofdre characters, Gmy and her
cast members spent many hours reading works by and ubourrhe lnwrenees.
Nick Wagner '025 served as dnmarurge for the production and assisted
in compiling the literary resources. Gray said the collaborative efforts have
been and continue to be a success.

The biggest reuon Jerfnrcs auditioned tor the play was rhrs opportu-
nity to investigate and reconcile Lawrence rhc non fictional mnn nnd
Lawrence the ncrional character. “I thought it would be inreresring to play
someone who actually lived," he said.

Still, Herr: l'emnlns an original and ﬁcllonni play. Gmy said she made n
clmr that rhouglt the characters ore based on real people che actors srill

should adapt the chmccer to the plays atmosphere.

Bur dos an be difficult. “You want to make your character your own,”
Jeifryes said, “bur it's a on more dimeuh when you have all this autobio-
graphical information."

Mushl agreed that the different information sources drar inﬂuence each
character make for challenging complexities. “usually you have made all
the discoveries you need or make in your chancrcr in two weeks," she said,
“but me one cucnee oflaren's cthrer eluded me for a good pan orrhree
weeks of rehearsal

All actors give eredir to Gray for helping the across frnd the essence, to
understand who and whar rhey are conveying Margo is really good ar
asking us the reasons why were taking me character
in a cemin direction," Janson said, “And its when
she asks us d1ese questions do: we begin to formu»
[are whar we vranr to do wirh this play."

The play‘s direction

This collaboration is what Gray loves the most
about her director role, Doing this play, she said, “is
a ranlly great opportunity to get a message across,
bemusc it’s a really Collabonrive effort. You get to
be In charge of organizing rhese people to produce
something rhar will, hopefully, be meaningful "

Jansen said that the meaning woven into [RAM
is at times difﬁcult to pinpoint and portray, bur that
it’s important to ponder. Because DH. Lawrence is
well known as a misogynisr in his writings and his
life, Janson said, she can’t porrmy the relationship between brm and Frieda
as simple. “Tl-us play and Lawrence and me relationship are just full of
contradictions, Jonson said

Bur Jansen explained that IRzrrdoes not leave us contrasrs in oppos-
ing isolanon She said that though people often like to cleave percepnons
of Lawrence in two, [Roe both forces them rogedrer and forces the audie
cm: to talc: note.

In developing her character, Jonson had co work rhrough synthesizing
another dichotomy. in real life, Frieda was seen as both matron and seduc-
tress: she was often mistaken ror Lawrence’s mother, and yet her memoirs
document series Dfpmionare love affairs. Hrsroriradly, Janson said, “there's
always this dichotomy between morhcr or whore, or sexual or nurturing,
bur Frieda is both.”

Mushi‘s chnmcrcr Bret: also combines contradictions. At ﬁrst, Mushi
said, it is easy to see Brett “as the childish rnnocenr, especially when can-
trasted with Frieda's sometimes caustic nature"; inrer, however, Brett ls re-
vealed as “multifaceted. . .capable of jealousy and aggression.”

The rensrons and the tenderness in these blurred polarities are reasons
Johfryes admires 1 Rio. “It's a good play," he said. “You get to see n very
inreresring, and whorl drinkavery real, relationship between daree people."

Forging a relationship amidst alleged division, between love and here
or the expected and the unexpected, propels [Ron It should also, accord.
ing to Jonson, propel students to attend the porformonee. “The fact rhar
those ideas are really blurred really makes us think about them." she sold.
“and i think chars important for Grrnucll srudenrs to do,"
