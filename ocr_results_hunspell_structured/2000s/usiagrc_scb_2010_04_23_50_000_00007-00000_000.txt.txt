Multi-season photography project opens in Smith

BYTVLER BANAS

While it can be all to easy to look through the poverty
in urban areas as near as Des Moints, artistic passion drove
Lawrence Sumulong '10, who also serves as the 5&3 photo
editor, into the daily lives of the homeless.

The doors to a new photography exhibit opened last
Monday at smith Gallery. The installation was composed
entirely by Sumulong and is entitled "Levee”. Capturing
instantaneous ﬂashes ofboth calm and chaos, Sun-iulong's
project follows the lives of several homeless folk through
their day-to-day experiences in Des Moines. After accom-
panying them through multiple events in their lives, Sumu»
long shot and chose the photographs, along with writings
by the subjects themselves, that he thought best depiered
the Levee ethos.

The project began last tall when sumulong contacted
multiple poverrymutreach organizations in Des Moines—
namely, Hope Builders and Jappa Outreach—with a pho-
tography project
about homeless
culture in mind.
Through these
organizations,
sumulong was
introduced to
Al, Robert and
Rita (last names
w i t h h e l d ) r
. among others,
all of whom inhabit the levees of Des Moines. Sumulong
went on to develop personal relationships with these peo-
ple while sharing their aperiences and traeking the course
ofthe‘ir lives over the seasons. “I was afraid they would view
me as exploitive,“ sumulong said.

Instead, Sumulong’s commitment to engage with his
subjects on a human level resulted in a far more honest
connection and Sumulong checked in on his subjects often,
including phone calls during the winter holidays.

To give the homeless a chance to express their own per-
sonal narrative. Sumulong chose a few oftheir handwritten
letters to hang alongside the photographs. “It is important
to have their words speak for themselves," sumulong said.
In one letter, Al, the primary subject of Sumulong’s project,
remarks upon his “so-called homelessness."ln another, Rita
discusses the unrecognized passage ofher birthday and the
passage of friends writing, “I lost a friend last week...l
loved very much. 1 hope he knows today."

while the overall aura of sumulong’s project borders
on the dismal, it also evokes a strong empathy for those
without homes. "After working in a homeless shelter this

installation, said. All ofthe images were striking, most es-

on a stool, eyes direct and somber, with a eolostomy bag
resting on her lap.

In addition to representing the commonly conceived
lifestyle of homeless people, sumulong's project reveals
many of the less considered aspects of life in the levee.

Levee has been'a huge success and a patron has already
offered to buy prints rot an exhibit in Des Moines. How
ever, the exhibit means so much more to Sumulong than
just another portfolio asset‘it depicts the lives of some '
or his good friends. Sparking up conversations about local
poverty both within the College and without, Levee is as
provocative as it is visually stunning.
