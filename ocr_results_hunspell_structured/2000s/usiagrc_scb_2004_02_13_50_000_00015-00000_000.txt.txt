The teams
to beat

Grinnall men's and

women's swimming have

swept the last two

tournaments. The women,
indeed, have won two
srrrignr titles. However it
Glinnell doesn't triumph
this year, it's a pretty good

bet as to where their

tampetitlon will come from.
Between them, Lake Forest,
Gtinnell and Lawrence have
grabbed the top three spars
at Conference in each of
the last three seasons,
iriten wirn no close rivals.

Grin nell, however,

dominated in both’nien's
and women's lastyear, and
no current women's swimmer

was at Grinnell

the last

time an opponent gave the
Pioneers a serious challenge
ior rne ronreiencr title. The
