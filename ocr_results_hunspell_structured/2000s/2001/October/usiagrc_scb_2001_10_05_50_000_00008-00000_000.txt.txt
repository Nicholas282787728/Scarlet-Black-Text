Students speak out about What’s on their minds in 1A2
words or so, and you’re invited! If you have a random rant,
email it to newspapr@gﬁnnell.edu or mears@grinnell.edu b
Wednesday at 5 p.m. After all, complaining in a public
forum is always more fun than doing it alone.

 

 

 

Save your local grader
So when you think ofshit studentjobs on campus,
what do you think of? TED? Photocopier for your
local professor? How about grader. . . Grading has
got to be the most thankless job on campus. We are
never noticed when the job is done well, but when
we make a mistake. . . watch out! At least TBD
workers get couscous sculptures and ketchup
messages. Your friendly local grader doesn’t even
get the occasional funny notes When was the last
time you thought, upon receiving your homework
hack—wow, that is great grading job, More likely
you cursed aloud at the bitchiness of the person
behind the red pen. How could he take a point off
for that! Of course that’s what I meant! (note that
all graders are apparently male.) What people don’t
often realize is that it is a blessing to have a tough
grader. . . an easy grader leads you to believe that
you know the material. . . until the test, when you
get clobbered. So if you know your grader, give him
or her a hug—and if you don't, write a message on
your next paper thanking her if she helped you out
VThey deserve it.

Yearning for the Sci-Fi channel

All right, I suppose I can understand why Grinnell
doesn't get the Sci»Fi Channel. We know the college
is tlying to cut spending, and better to not get some
channels than frell up Dining Services any more than
it already is. Grinnell doesn‘t set cable packages,
and so could not substitute Sci-Fi for, . . certain other
channels 50, it is not really Grinnell's fault that I
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO WATCH FARSCAPE FOR OVER A
MONTHIIIE and am entering withdrawal.

But to add insult to injury, Icarl’t even watch Star
Trek: Enterprise. Now granted UPN is a network with
almost no redeeming virtues, but now I don't even
know whether the show stinks!

A plaintive plea: where, where are Grinnell’s sci-ﬁ/
fantasy fans? Won't you take pity on a poor pathetic
ﬁrsteyear? Then I could at least have company in
my misery . .
