Hey Joe, wadda ya know?

Dear Joe Grim Fernberg.

The Talmud says. "lfyou do nor know where you are going, any
road will rake you shere." Your reeens sereed seems so eonfirm rhis
wisdom.

FYI, Lisa Serglenko worked as Quad dining hall four ssroighs
years so pay for her books, soilesries, and osher needs. Currensly she
drives a '92 Geo Ssorm wish 160,000 miles on she odomerer and
rears is shird floor walkeup oparsmenr for $450.00 a monsh. She has
no dishwasher besides her own rwo hands and drives her Gco so she
laundromas, She also has a good job shos pays well and gives as leasr
5 persons ofher rake home pay so orhers, among rhem refugees and
she impoverished orall nasions.

Another response

Lisa Sergienko's ongoing argumens againss Dan Roshsehild be.
came sruly idiosie in loss week's lesser as she ssooped so oeeuse him of
nor being in a posision so drseuss eonsumerism's relarionship wish
pasriosism beeause he |iv<3 in "she ivory rower" insseod or "she real
world," Such arrogans ageism (eombined wish a eonfusing strezme
of-ccnsciousnm wrisingssyle) makes sergienko's orgumenssorrremely
weak. onee again, she has failed so see she peins of Roshseliild's
column: consumerism is a selfish seiiviry, 2nd rherefnre eannos be
eoiiased wish porriosism.

As Toe Grim chbcrg mensioned in his lesser of Des. 12. our
soeiesy has beeome roeused on eonsumprion so a ridieulous degree.
