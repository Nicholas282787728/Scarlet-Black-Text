Grinnell welcomes
Afghani refugees

The geographically removed crisis in the Middle East has become local

by Katie Meats
Editor in Chief

A consortium of Grinnell area churches and college
students agreed in a meeting Wednesday to sponsor two
refugee families from Afghanistan who should be arriving
in early November.

The process that led to this step, and the formation of
this group. began when lauia Polstein '04 attended a peace
rally in Des Moines on Sept. 24 and received a flyer about
Afghani refugees in the Des Moines area.

Originally. Polstein didn't assume that the college could
take on actually hosting a family, but she knew Grinnell
could help in some way because. she said, “we have such a
strong volunteer base. "

She and Amy Graves, director ofthe Community Set»
vice Center. went to a meeting in Des Moines about the
refugee program run by the Lutheran/Catholic Coopera—
tive Refugee Resettlement Ministry.

There. Polstcin realized that maybe Grinneli could host
a family. “A: thcywere presenting to a group ofDes Moines
area parishes." Polstcin said. “I realized that a committee
ofGriiinell people could do that. but from the beginning
we knew it would have to be a town and gown partner.
ship."

While Pols‘tein was gone'fot the weekend, Graves talked
to Ellen Prusinski '02 and Annie Tessat '04 from who lead
the trips to Des Moines every weekend to work at the
Catholic Worker.

They beiaine interested in the process and joined
Polstein in working on the project.

Early on, Polstein had a lot of con
cerns about bringing refugees to
Gtinncll. “We had concerns about the
organizational effort. about what stu.
denrs might not be able to provide."
l’olstein said.

“Concerns about plopping daem in
the middle ofGrinnell, pulling them out
of their community; concerns about
people being really energetic about this
now, right after Sept. ll, but this is a
family diat lives here so the effort can't
die out,"

originally Polstein, Tessar and
Pmsinski were working very mudr in theshort term, think»
ing that they would ask churches for food and personal
items to take to Des Moines the following Saturday.

But later that day, Polstcin talked to Laura Keegan, the
Volunteer Coordinator for Catholic charities. and she 15v
suaged Polstein's fears about Griiinells adcquacy as a hoste
ingsite. She reminded Polaroin that the oommuniry has a

lot offer in terms of resources, both monetary and social.

Tossat talked to Chaplain Deanna Shorb who recoin.
mended that they go to otiniiell Ministerial Association
meeting on \Y/cdncsclay. Tessar and Polstein went to that
meeting and announced their idea tot Grinncll to host a
family in a very informal way.

Polstcin said that they received positive feedback but
that the church leaders wanted a more clear structure and
specifics on what exactly was being proposed.

At that point. Polstcin, Tossar and trusinski decided
that they needed to have a meeting for both students and
community members with Keegan present where she could
answer the speciﬁc questions posed by the churches

it worked out that Kcegan was in crinnell on Sunday
for a RISE teachein; so the meeting took place on Sunday
afternoon.

about bringing these families to Grinnell without a com-
munity, saying that there are only three families in Des
Moines right now anyway, so there isn't much ofa com.
munity there either.

Keegan stressed the tenuous nature ofthe families route
trey. saying that the group should put down a deposit on
the property as late as possible. beeause it's impossible to
know, until they're on the plane, ifthey'to coming torture
or not.

The families coming to Grinncll will be widows with
three. four or five children. so the mothers won't work for
at least for the first couple years they’re in the us. in that
time, they’ll need help learning English. understanding basic
American tasks like doing laundry and groceryshopping,
paying rent and managing their budget,

A church member who Worked wrth the refugees in
Grinnell from Cambodia in the 805 explained her experi»
ences. “You have to be willing to give 250 percent ofyour
time. 24/7," she said. “You have to be that committed to
what you're doing."

Keegan also stressed the involuntary nature ofrhe ima
migration to the us. “They're coming here not because
they want to," she said. “They have to, or they could be
killed or their emin could starve."

When the meeting ended on Sunday, with the group
deciding to go back to their individual constituencies. talk
about what had happened and come back together later in
the week, on Wednesday.

At Wednesday's meeting, the decision was made to
move forward in the process of
sponsoring the family.

instead ofone church fulfill.
ing die whole roleofsponsot. the
model the group decided upon
was that ofa wheel “I’m seeing
this model with a key person. like
a wheel," Roma Stewart said.
“and all these different commie
tees around that, made up ofdif.
fcrent people within the diftete
ent churches."

The goal is that this model
can provide the simplest method
of taking care of the jobs that
need to be done without duplication oftask-s.

A! the next meeting on Tuesday, a scheme ofthatwheel
will be presented as well as mild about housing and ties
rails on the make tip of the families.

The neitt major step for students is planning an ESL
training to take place right afiet fall break. information

The student involvement has yet to be determined axe

“We have free time more often during the day." Phil
Schaffiier '02 said, “A lot ofsrudents showed interest and
that's the kind of thing that, as a community ofstudeiits,
we could continue for a long time."
