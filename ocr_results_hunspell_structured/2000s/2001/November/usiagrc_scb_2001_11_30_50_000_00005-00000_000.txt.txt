When white nationalists came to power in

South Africa in 1948, they instituted a system

of rigid racial divisions called apartheid. Violent
struggles between dissidents and government
forces marked the 19805. Two Grinnell students,
born one week apart on opposite ends of the
country, bring us two different perspectives on
South Africa‘s journey toward democracy.
