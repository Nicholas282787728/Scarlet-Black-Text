m KDIC’s Disfunkt ‘all about the music’

Dave McClelland gives listeners their weekly dose of electronic music on his radio show

I don't pretend to
know anything about
anything, but I
couldn't help but read
this letter 1 got in the
mail the other day.
Apparently, I have to
pay $1,980 more than
1 did last year in order
to attend Grinnell, and
so do you. That's a
7.5% increase, even
though 1 heard
somewhere that
inflation is only about
3%. The Trustees
seem to think that we
need to be just as
expensive as our peers
are. This doesn't make
much sense because,
unlike our peers, we
happen to be located
in Nowhere, Iowa.
Luckily, on the very

same dayI received
another letter in the
mail, this one from
Publishers Clearing
House informing me
that 1 might have
already won
$1,000,000! Aftera
little simple math, I
ﬁgured out that arter
paying the tuition
increase I would still
have $998 020 to
spend on important
things, like my UN
dues, bubble gum,
magic beans, and my
damn text books.

But although my
ﬁnancial problems
seem to have been
miraculously solved by
Ed McMann, the rest of
the Students on
campus still have to
scrape up an extra
$2,000 to ﬁnish their
education. To raise
this money students
have reportedly begun
resorting to
prostitution, patritide,
and the selling of
their souls. Other
students have acted in
an even more rash
manner by procuring
jobs at Quad or taking
out student loans. No
one seems to realize
the entire campus can
be saved if only
someone was to steal
Russell K. Osgood’s
wallet.

or course, If you
don't want to make a
decision or participate
in an activity that will
plague you for life, I
suggest selling out to
a major corporation. I
am, for example, going
to need something to
tide me over until the
Prize Patrol van can
ﬁnd its way to my
door. I think that I'll
sit back and enjoy this
cool, crisp, refreshing
bottle of Coca-Cola.
AHHHHI Always Coca-
Cola.
