the 200- and 500- yard freestyles last semester, set school marks
in both events in a duel meet with the University of the South
Jan. 13 in Sewanee, Tenn. Holm’s time of2:01.51 in the 200
freestyle was just fast enough to break the previous record of
2:01.62, set in 1988 by Meg Philpoit. Her 5:22.09 in the 500
bent the record time ofstzzsz by less than a second as well.

Holm. .111 Omaha native, becomes the third freshman mem-
ber of the Grinnell women’s swimming (61m to set a school
record this season. Amber Gedllnske '04, and Rachel Sellon

Kirksvillc, M0,, Dec. 1-2.

As a team, the Grinnell women
took ﬁrst place in eight of the 13
events in which they competed but

1:49.24 in the 200 freestyle. Ania Mikos ’02. won the one»
meter diving competition with a total score of 18125.

The men’s contest was not as close with the University of

’01, excelled in the 100-yard backstroke with a ﬁrsbplacc time
of5614, The Menasha, Wis, native has placed ﬁrst each time
he has competed in the 100 this season and he holds the school
records in both the 100- and ZOOcyzrd backstroke. The relay

Grinnell Invite since I've been here.
In addition to all the school records
that were set, we set several sea»

icy with a time of 1:44.59. Kimball also turned in a strong per.
formance in his first attempt at the lOG-yard breaststroke, place
ing second at 1:04.99.

sprint swimmers Anthony Westbrooks '01, Liksrish, and
Josh hunger '03, finished third, fourth and ﬁfth in the 50-yard
freestyle, and lake Pollack '02. cracked the top five with hunger
and Westbrooks in the 1110,

“This was by far the best we've ever done against [the Uni-
versity ofthc southl." remarked head coach Erin Hurley, “We
used to get dominated by them every time wevvent down there,
but this time our tcaiit, particularly the women's team, really
held its own, it shows you the
progress this squad has made in the
past few weeks. 1'

The Grinnell swimmers re.
turned from their road trip to host
the Grinnell invitational last week-
end at Ray obermiller Pool.

sellon broke the school record
in the 200 butterﬂy with a 2:1256
at the invitational. sellon's time
also passed the NCAA-B qualify.
ing standard, meaning that she will
swim the event in the NCAA Na-
tionals in Buffalo, N.Y., March a.
lo ifall slots from mcfasterAtimc
qualifiers are not taken.

In addition to the 200 fly, Sellon also placed first in the 200
backstroke and the 200 and 4001M’s. Hot 400 time of4145.12

native made the scent in the 400 IM earlier this season,

l-iolm shattered another school mark with a 18:17.67 in
the 1650 freestyle. Holm would have set a record in the event
six weeks ago at the Truman state invitational if not for
Gedlinske, who swam the former record of 18:30.13. Holm
and Gedlinske have challenged each other in the 1650 all sea»
son.

“I hope there's not a rivalry developing," said Hurley, “but 1
do think they will push each other on to bigger and better things.
They're both competitive enough that they want to do well for
the sake of doing well, not just out»doing each other. 1 also
want to recognize Kerstin Wolf['01], who had the best meet of
her routeyesr career last weekend."

Wolfis a former record—holder in the 1550 and she shares

the team’s soc freestyle relay mark with teammates Alela McCotd
103. Emily Mohl ’02, and sarah Davis '00.

The efforts ofsellon, Holm and Wolflcd the Pioneers to a
first—place ﬁnish in the ten.team meet. Grinnell scared nearly
twice as many points 25 its closest competitor, Luther College,
who had 558. Holm. Gedlinske and McCord finished one—two—
threo tn the 500»yatd freestyle and Emma Samuels ’04, won
the loo.ysrd backstroke for the second consecutive meet.

“We hid an incredible meet, the best Grinnell invite since
l've been here," Hurley, now in her sixth-year with the pro—
gram, said. “In addition to all the school records that were set,
we set several season bests and had 2 lot ofenthusinsm. l was
glad to see that the squad had bonded so well after 18 straight
days etswimming,"

points. For the first time all season, Hocst was defeated in the
loo-yard backstroke. losing to Jeremy Lankford ofthe Univer»
sity of Chicago by one-hundredth of a second. l-ioest got the
better of Lsnkrord in the zoo backstroke. however, and both
his times were less than 3 second oft the school records he set 2
year ago.

Kimball made a push with zsecondvplace ﬁnish in the 10!)
yard breaststroke and a third.place in the 200. Eric Blevins '04,
dove both the onvmetet and three-meter boards for the first
time and finished second in both events. Luther College won
the meet with 503 poinn.

“1 was most pleased with our men‘s relay teams,” Hurley
said, ”Peter Likarish had some really good sprints and time-
drops and Anthony Westbrooks and ice benson [’03], are ﬁn»
ishing well and peaking at the right time."

“The right time" could be two weeks from now at the Mid-
west Confeience Championships, which will be hosted by
Grinnell this season. The Pioneers have iust one more tune.up
left on the schedule, the lowa small state championships at
Coe College in Cedar Rapids,

“Coe gave us a good meet in December and Luther and
Simpson will also be there," said Hurley. “We'll put out our
best lineup because, ofcourse, we want to win, but it's also our
last practice before the big show."

Pioneer offers a fan’s guide to men’s basketball

After last year the Midwest Conference
coaches poll chose the Grinnell men: basket.
ball team to finish last in the conference.

We are now ranked number two in the (out
ference and arc heading into a weekend at
home, lfwe can win even one ofthc games we
will be in a very good position indeed for the
conference play-
offs.

Well, ifyou are
still reading this,
you are obviously
interested in basketball and did not ittst casut
ally glance at this because you were in the
mailroomanywayandwerewaitingforifiienti,

We havc three home games left in this sen.
soit, and we have made the most of them so
for. We are 6-0 at home, and this is attributed
in no small patt to the super fans who inhnbit
the stands. You ill make noise, make fun of
the opposing team, stippoit ottt term and in
general are ,iist hardcore. For yott, the dcdi»
cited diehard runs of the spott. it is time to
familisri-rc you with the term. With this simple
guide, you out .tdd witty banter in support of
Grinnell, mther than “Ohhhhi” “Ahhliii!”
“Foul! Whit 21m you looking at?" and my per»
sonal favotitc, “Threel” (that let one is accom»
nanied, ofcourse, with both hands high above
your head),

This guide is to give you an inside view of
who we are and what we do, it is by person,
nndweare easy enough to tdcn fyon thecoutt.

- Coach Arseneault. “Coach A." Notinnlly
oneofthc most interesting people to watch on
the court. He is the gauge to watch to see how
we itre playing that night. lfwe are doing well,
he will clsp above his head. lfwc are doing
very poorly, you will know.

~ Couch Geiking. “Gerk,” Gerk was oit the
team until his anterior cruciite ligament den

cided it had had enough of active duty and
went fornn enrly retirement. Gcrk is in charge
ofthc innking sure the motions get on the floor
at the right times. He is nowhere near .15 exit-
ing as Coach A to watch during the game, but
he is indispensable nonetheless.

Now that you know the coaches, we gct on

to the players.
Everyo nc
has their
own moti-
vation and
something that gets them going obviously it
yott know these things, you can help spttr the

- Nick Milinowski, zxrhit is complicated,
we know, but if you manage to sing a song

“T" instead oftl-ircc,

- Ken Heiser. 12. Although new to the
team, he runs with the best. “Special K," “K-
