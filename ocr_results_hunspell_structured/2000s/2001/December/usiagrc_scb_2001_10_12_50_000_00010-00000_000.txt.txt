Budgét “Committee changes
bring some dissent

Budget, cont. from p.1

—get decision from what type of fertiliser
they put on the lawn to how much money
is given to financial aid,"

According to Ford, the administration
told him that thcy didn't include students
because the students don't have a long»
enough range view ofthe college, but Ford
said that's entirely untrue. “They do," he
said. “The problem is that students have
never had the opportunity "

The other reason the administration
gave Ford rot ex-
cluding students
was that other
members of the
campus commu-
nity were excluded
as well, like the
staff. Ford re.
sponded by saying
that the stafrs est.
clusion is not
sen-s fault and
that all groups
should have their
voices hard.

Osgood re.
sponds to these criticisms by saying that
diings might change in the itinirc. “Some
people say. ‘but we would like to be on it,
be represented: like sen and i will say that
I’m sympathetic to that andl wouldn't rule
that out; after we've tried it this year we
might add some student representation."

Though Ford is disappointed by the
administrations “stecdrast refusal" to admit
students into the process, he sees this step
as merely a small step back in a longetetm
movement toward increased shared govere
nance. “we’ve come a ways since ‘98-'99.
which was the beginning ora new em in
terms ole'Te dynamics ofgovernance in the
Grinnell community“ he said. “Things are
changing, somewhatslowly butsteadily. ,.
Every yar the scope ofgovernance widens,
the arnountofshared dedsion—maklngwidr
ens. My hope is that itwill continue in years
to come."

FFE roll over
After the Fund For Excellence (FFE)

was terminated by the Board othustees in

its meetinglast February, many projects that
had been funded by the FFE remained.
These programs included the orifice ofSo-
cial Commitment, Mentored Advanced
Projects (MAPs), the Faillconeanllery and
the Center or Prairie studies.

The budgercommitree examined some
ofthe programs last year. and some remain
for this year. There are more decisions to
be made this year on the rest of the FFE
programs, Though Osgood said that there
was no cxacl formula as to which programs
got examined lastyear and which this year,
he said that the
c o tn m t t t e a
mostly folded in
what he thought
were the
iincorirroversial
items. He said,
“it seemed [last
year] that things
that were un»
likely to be ever
tc r min a re d
should be tolled
in, like MAPS."

As to last
year’s process of
rolling items into the general budget,
Osgood said that it was hard to discern
which werehis mquesu and which were the
rest of the committees‘. This confusion is
because the committee was so small, and
he sat directly on it. Osgood said that he
hopes the new process will create a more
formal separation within the hierarchy. disc
pelling some concerns about his influence.

Faculty members who wished to remain
unnamed expressed conmrn that these pro»
grams were being absorbed into the budget
without the administration consulting die
faculty. one complaintivas that the Fund
for Excellence decisions, which were
reached in a non-democratic process, still
remain priorities.

For example, one proposal made to the
Fund For Excellence was to decrease class
size by hiring more professors. That pro<
posal was not fundedbyrhe FFE, but many
others were, and now only those that were
fundedhave the possibiliryorcontinuation.

Osgood responded to these criticisms
by saying that decisions about the budget

"Things are changing. Some—
what slowly but steadily. . s
Every year the scope of gover-
nance widens, the amount of
shared decision making widens.
My hope is that it will continue
in years to come."

—Paul Ford 56A President

as a whole have never been made by cone
sensus, He said, “The decision ofwhat gets
absorbed into the budget or what doesn't
get absorbed has never been a matter ofyes
to this or no to that by a large group."

He added diat the faculty and its cur»
riciilum committee would discuss any of
the FFE proposals that were signiﬁcantly
academic in the coming year, borexarnple,
he said last year the budget committee
rolled the expenses ofMAPs into the base
budget, but that proiect is still an experi-
ment so it the faculty were to abolish it,
then the money would be rolled back into
the base budget ror reallocation.

Long-range planning

other than dividing the general fund
between the divisions of the college, the
budget steering committee is also respon—
sible for institutional long-range planning.
brand said, “[Thc budget steering
committee’s] job will be to think about
long-mnge planningas it makes budget rec-
ommendations to the president."

To thzt end, the committee asked de-
partments to project their budget for the
next three years. The hope is that the come
mrttce will be able to foresee any malor bud»
get changes a few years in advance and plan
for them

Also last year, another new committee
formed, this time within the faculty, to dis
cuss longrange planning. This one is made
up of faculty members, appointed by the
faculty as a whole, with the purpose ofdise
ciesing longrange academic goals.

According to faculty members, who
wished to remain unnamed, the facultyand
administration's processes should be more
uniﬁed. One said that the inclusive deci-
sron making process is a long one that takes
over a year to properly bring in students,
stair and faculty. “(The longetcrm plan
ning] process should ideally be run by the
powers or the college, not run by the {no
city," the faculty member said. “It's only
cﬁective if the administration is commit-
ted to carrying the decisions,"

Brand said that the committees will in»
form each other. "[The faculty committee]
will provide invaluable guidance to the bud-
get proccss," he said.

According to Osgood, the administra—

tive budget process needs the raculty comr
mittec beans: the administrative process
needs the faculty’s insight into that large sec.
tion ofthecollege’s spending. He said, “The
two are related, but i don’t think they du-
plitate because , . i the academic budget is
so huge. For us to sit there and think, ‘God,
we know we're going to do x independent
ofwhar the faculty says would be insane,"

As to whether any group is doing in-
stitution—wide planning Osgood responded
that, though it is part orbrand’s lob, “the
truth is at the moment, were focused on
getting asolid long-range plan for academic
purposes."The adini ‘stration has this fo.
cus because, osgood said, “we can't have a
solid view ofthe ruturc until we havea solid
academic plan."

brand added that the academic plan is
“the nugget, the kernel, of any long term
institutional planning."

Though the college does not have a
longstange, institutionewidc plan in place
at the moment, irstill continues with bond.
ing projecc. like the Welcome Center and
the new East Campus dorms.

Osgood said that the overall audemlc
plan might very well affect the shape of the
academic facilities, which is why the school
has not yet begun working on any ofthe
academic construction. “were doing the
things that we mn’t imagine that we don’t
need.” he said. “it's rust good planning."

Several faculty members said that they
worried about the career their committee's
decisions would have on the budget pm-
ccss. Onesaid that ifthe administration and
the faculty were doing the same thingi
longrerm planning—the administration
would surely follow through with what it
decides.

To some taculty members it simply
came down to trust and whether they be.
lieved that their comments to the adminis.
tration made a difference. one said,
“[Osgood] sends decisions out, soliciting
comments, asking fotcmaals. He take those
responses and makes the decision anyway.
No one at.large knows what those com—
ments were."
