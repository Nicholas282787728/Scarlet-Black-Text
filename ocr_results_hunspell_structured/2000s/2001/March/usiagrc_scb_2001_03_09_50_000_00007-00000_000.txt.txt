Active space Residency Events

Skye: Tuesday at 2:15 p. in. in Roberts Theater, there
will be a talk given by Lisa Marie (Naugle, not Presley)
whose titlc contains the words “Active space 'l’all
This is not, however, a speech given by a highly ai
mated and spacey woman, not is it about constellav
tions, as you might at first believe. on the contrary,
this is actually cooli Ms. Naugle will be speaking
about the involvement of “intcractive performance
technology" in thc art or choreography. I didn’t even
know there was such a thing as “interactive perfor-
mancc technology." This is part of an Active space
icsidency on campus throughout next week. The tech-
nology is really cool. For all ofyou who like to move
it move it, deﬁniiely check these events oiit,

Dallas: I had never heard ofthis technology before
either, but it sounds incredible. A computer applica-
tion controls all ofthe lights and sound on stage, but
it doesn't play jiist a continuous program. The coin-
puter is hooked up to a video camera that reports the
actions on the stage, and the comptiter responds ac-
cordingly by playing music, or changing the lighting.
lcan't really describe this striffbecaiisc I’ve never seen
it in act So check out the demonstrations and
lectures throughout the week to ﬁnd out more info.

Skye: ltl understand correctly, this has incredible
potential for all kinds officlcls iii the performing arts.
Just thinlt— it's possible that a dancer could move
onstage and thc rinisic would be coordinated with their
movenientss . tostay in syncwith the performance.

Dallas l3rrt nor only does this apply to choreogttt»

senting lectures on Monday and Wednesday, respec-

Seeking out
the obscure

A 7 9705 avant-garde jazz
album provides good music
and bragging rights

One of the greatest feelings in the world for me Is
finding an incredibly obscnre album and then telling
people about it that Ccrmln tone of voice that says:
“You’ve never heard this album? You loser. Get out
of my face." This is part of the reason I write these
reviews, 1 get to have this feeling almost every week.
(I'd imagine that it is a feeling skin to how panl
Charltin feelstbour Mahler'sTl-iitd, but I'm not sure.)
The only thing probably more obscure than the tar

movie ofthc same name by French New wave dll'cc»

already linltwny to infinite coolness, try and stop me.

Listening to Lers‘mmrc Saphiz, you have to win
der why this album has been neglected for so long.
Qtiitc amazingly, the album blends Chicagocsrylc frec

seamlessly. Recorded during the Art Ensemble of

thankfully they recorded it anyway.

The Art Ensemble otChicago was a
product orthe Atsociation rot the Ad
vansemont of creative Musicians
(AACM). Begun in I965 by pianist
Richard Muhal Abrams, the AACM
dedicated itselfto creating original and
serious “black" music At a time when

Older versions of the play eliminated the tevnil

end that “in spite ofcvcrything. . . people are really good at heart."
