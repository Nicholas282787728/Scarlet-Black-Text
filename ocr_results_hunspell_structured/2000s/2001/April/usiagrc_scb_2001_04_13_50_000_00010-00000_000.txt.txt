Incorrect portrayal

Dear crlnnelllans,

i am wrning in response ro rhe arrlele in rhe lasr sods,
"Drill ream eaprain answers pressing qucsrlons." I believe rhar
rhis arriele porrrayeu rhe drill ream lneorreerly. I know it is [he
popular bellerrhar a drill ream is a peppy, cheerleaderlilee group,
and sarah Aswell‘x airlele eerrainly added he rhls lneorreer por.
rrayal by adding in words and changing around my senrenees,
in doing this, she was able ro Support rho popular opinion of
the student body and ereare unneeessary eomroversy. I am very
disappolnred re see rhar a eollege journalisr could so badly rwisr
rhe words efher interviewee,

Now, i would like to elear up a few things abour rhe drill
ream. I am quite aware rhar rhere are many people on eampus
who reara group hhe rhls becoming a parr orcrlnnell College,
however, rhis fear is unnecessary. The drill team will not be
anything like a eheerleading squad. and we will not be per.

many differenr rypes of daneing, and rhe reason rhar Angela
sparks and I wanred ro srarr rhis elrlll team was because many
ofrhese amazing dance terms are nor presenr ar Grllmcll. we
didn't want ro cause controversy or bring a dirsy, cheerleader

A simple question

An open lerrer ro rheTrusrees orGrlnnell College:

lam wrlrlng ro aslea question, a question that, lrseems ro
me, lies at rhe borrom or our College’s rnrernal disagreemenrs
and confusions; ar the same rime, lr is a very simple quasrlon.
Still, in spire oflrs imporranee and simplielry, as tar as i know
me quesrlon has never been given a simple answer. I am writ»
mg in rhe hope, perhaps naive, rhar rhe question. now clearly
posed, may ﬁnd. once and for all, a clear response. So please,
dear trustees, ifyou find the rlme, rell us:

To whom, preelsely, does rhls college belong?

Just let me run

The answer eoulel be as simple as rhe question For ex.
ample "To rhe srudenrs." or perhaps. “To the workers, rhe
faeulry and staff.” on “To us, rhe trustees,” lfyou will only
give us an answer, rhen nesr rime we disagree, we may ar leasr
know where we and

In poor taste

I didn‘t appreeiare rhe arriele rhar was wrlrren abour rhe
drill team, I found lr to be lnsulrlng ro Dree and re be malelng
light ofrhe group she is rrylng ro pur rogerher. I don‘t think ir
is fair ro mock a drill ream merely beeause you thlnk rr some.
how resembles a cheerleading squad. Quite frankly i could care
less about a drill ream, bur far be u from me, or anyone else on
this eampus, ro make fun ofanyone who would enyoy being a
dancer. l rhoughr rhe arrrele was very ehlldish and in poor taste.
1 hope rhar everyone who read rhae article reallzed rhe ndicm
lousness or ir, and i hope that anyone who ls offended by or
opposes a drlii ream will remove his head from his anus.

Offensive signs

I eonslder rhe reeenr loggia signs advertising fenelng classes,
reading "Do You Like Long PoinryThings rThar Thrust .And

was not meant to be so, mosr of rho eampus will srlll inrerprer
ir that way) and rhe "violently arraele" parr suggesrs rape in a
way rhar is most disrurbing to me. soon symbolism is doubly
harmful: it gives a bad name ro rhe fenelng program, and n
feeds rhe paranoia of people who eonslder every man ro be a

Students speak

you're invited! If
you have a
random rant,
email it to

After all,
complainaing in a
public forum is
always more fun
than doing it
alone.

Yes, that is me you have seen jogging up 6th Ave.,
around Ahrens Park and back down 10th Ave. lately,

Yes, I know you have not seen me doing this be-
fore.

No, 1 do not think this warrants you to do any of
the things that have been done to me while jogging.

Please refrain from driving by with your windows
down and yelling things like, "Hey, sexy!" or, "Voya-
yo" at my jogging partner and I. I know we are sexy,
there is no need to tell me so.

Please refrain from driving by with your windows
down and "shooting" colorful squirt/cap guns in my
general direction. I warn you, I am playingAssassins,
and I will be armed next week,

Please do, if you see me passed out in the gutter
from exhaustion, call an ambulance.

Post-Traumatic Spring Disorder
Imust admit that several things have rendered me
dismayed and confused since I have returned from
break. First, there are an abundance of computer mice
around this campus that do not scamper, mieelike,
across the screen, but rather get stuck and cease to
roll around, forcing me to try to take them apart, bash
them on the head and put them back together. This
rarely works. Second, the weather (of last weekend),
as usual, has gotten my little hopes up, only to send
them crashing down, windeblown and distraught. But
the biggest disappointment has been the three tests
I’ve had to take since returning from spring break.
Tests happen before breaks, not afterthem, thus pm-
viding the reason for a “break”. Don’t professors know
this? ,

You made it past Darcy’s evil eye, waited for That
Guy to get his two waters with the slow machine,
managed to locate your sneeze entirely on the sneeze
guard, and even found a space for your tray next to
the plastic fruit on top of the salad bar. But one pen'l
is unavoidable: getting peas with a pair or tongs.
mutant peach slices with a tiny spoon, or ketchup-
covered lemon slices with a ladler I've seen even the
friendliest vegan howl profanities as his garhanzo
beans were crushed by the tongs meant to get them
from the communal trough to his plate, inadequate
food-getting implements make the happy-go-lucky
jaded, the conﬁdent and athletic embarrassed, and
the stressed-out and hungry maniacal. When will this
nightmare end? ,
