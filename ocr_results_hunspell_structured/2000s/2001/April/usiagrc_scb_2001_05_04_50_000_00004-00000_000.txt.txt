after] leave the
completely unrealistic
island community that
is Grinnell College.
Arter looking through
the newspaper for a
job, I have come to the
conclusion that even
though I have a liberal
education in the
humanities, social
sciences and physical
sciences, nobody wants
to hire me. Sure, I can
see the deeper meaning
behind stupid poems,
but I don't know how
to pump gas.
That boy from your
high school who
decided to go to
welding school instead
of college had the right
idea. I bet he has a
good, solid job now.
And a nice girlfriend.
And a dog. I bet that

 

Show ”Wahoo' Plunge"

Rachel Licbcrmnn thinks that “Wahool
Plunge" is the best show on KDIC, and iryoii're orthe type that
digs hm, you might agree. The show, cur
rently in its third incarnation, is the creation
of DR Marti: Johnson and Kﬂslﬂ Plckarz.
Said Johnson, “We did ir so that we could
spend more time together and listen to mu.
sic." Prekarc characterized rhcir show by we
plaining, “When we first started, it was called
‘Wahoo! Plunge: Moderation is a Memory,"
to whiclijohnson added, “We don’t llkC mod-
crarion. We want fun all the time."

Appropriately. early playlisrs includeda lot
ethos music and punky stutr but it was all
poppy," explained Johnson, who described the
currenrshowas hmnng‘ho specific genre. We
play more women than men, out it's not air
allegirl show,” l‘iekarz agreed, saying “some.
times we have n them: and sometimes wc

We did it so that we
could spend more time
together and listen to
music. When we ﬁrst
started, it was called
’Wahoo! Plunge: Modera-
tion is a Memory, We
don’t like moderation.

We want fun all the terroree

kid has a dog now.

The point is, the world
needs welders, riot
non-welders. The only
job I saw that I was
really qualiﬁed rot was
library assistant, a
position that requires
only an intimate
knowledge of the
Dewey Decimal system,
a homely or matronly
appearance and mid
calf length skirts. I
don't even know if my
knowledge of the
Dewey Decimal system
is intimate enough.
Besides, I won't look
matronly ror another
ﬁve years or so.

I don't even have it the
worst. While J'oh
searching I didn’t see a
single ad requesting
people with "a strong
background in the
Greek and Roman
classics, Must know all
forms oF'l die' in all
tenses in Latin, even
those useless tenses
like passive suhjunctive
pluperiect ﬁrst person
plural." And even ifI
did see an ad like that,
by the time I shouted
”mortuus esseml”
about a thousand
unemployed and
hungry classics majors
would have
materialized from the
shadows, applied, been
hired and translated
Catullus’ complete
works for kicks. Sum
vana‘,

At least we know that
we can go to our local
library and look up
hooks about welding.
The call number is 671,
under "metal working
and metal products," in
case you're interested.

for Johnson, who has "bought more CDs as a
DJ " Accordingly, Piekarzstared, “I wouldn’t
keep up with music, otherwise. And i love it
when people call and say your show made

However, due to this mystcnr

and clocks as Chuck, and we get that sense here.
The most Surprising (pleasantly, at that) aspect
of this ﬁlm is the scenes with Hanks alone on the
island. We get a heautitul silent scene where we see
Hanks adaptingto his environment, cronringshele

actor, not even Tom Hanks, could keep a movie
interesting by himself for an hour. It's a were

Another big sure
prise was Helen

keeps Chuck's hope alive, so does Kelly give a fresh

Anotliei- ﬁlms from
2000, thrs is a sroiy or
the Marquis dc Sade in
the twilight of his life,
He's been incarcerated
in an insane asyluin,
where a laundry maid
helps him continue to write. Stars Geotfrey Rush,
Joaquin Phoenix, and Kare Winslet.
This was my choice tor the Oscar for Best trier

rure. it's a shame it wasn't nominated. We see de
Sade as a man who's been born twisted, However, he
knows who he is and doesn't deviate from that. The
reaction he gets from the liberal Abbe (Phoenix) and
the equally sadistic Dr. Roycr-Collnrd (Michael
Came) shows how little these men truly understand
themselves. The Ahbe is at least trying, but it seems
a bit hypocritical that the doctor punishes de Sade
tor his highly sexual actions and then lusts after
women himself, 1 had to ask the question whether
this was worse than the actions of de Sade, and it
seems they were.

Geolrrey Rush does an excellent job portraying de
Sade as a character who is evil to the core, out to
sponsive to his own desires in a way others ofhis time
couldn't ”understand. Joaquin Phoenix also does a
tremendous ,oh as rhe Abhe, trying to understand
people like do Sade through his lens ofreligious icre
vor and all the complications that brings,

Gettinga glimpse at theworst kind otevil in a way
that isn't completely hissed is retreshmg. Seeing the
tribulations ore man who needs to write nor being
allowed to because orthe content of those writings

really torces you to
contemplate your
reactions to the
story you've been
told. How can you
end up pulling for
someone as evil as
de Sadc?

i paid to see this
one once. it wasn’t
out long, and it
didn’t show in ma
Jor theaters (mainly
due to the extreme
content). But it
was excruciatingly
close to brilliance.

Fred will be back

next week, as will the regularcontenr ofthis column,
I'm sure you'll all appreciate that. especially Evan
Smith.
