The man behind the- shorts

Mando Montano convinces visiting Spanish Professor Jose Castillo to bare it all

RVMANDO MONTANO

Thc errenr of visiting spnnlsh Professor Jose cistillos
e npiis btrry wns bcsr seen at last semester's Halloween
Hati when the wrrining costume was tight black biking
shorts, a grey spandex muscle tee shirt, and i bik g helmet,
an outfit that Castillo sported frequently in the dining hall at
the beginning ot‘thc year.

Although Castillo is notorious on campus, most students
know little about hiln beyond his distinct attire and his status
as a visiting spunish professor.

Castillo and his family immi-
grated to New Yolk City from the
Dominican Republic in 1971, when
he was four and a linlfyenrs old.Thc
son of an ofﬁcer of the Dominican
Republic, Castillo initially decided
to pursue medicine under the inﬂu-
ence ofhis uncle. “I really respected
my uncle, because he graduated
from medical school whorl h: was
21,” Castillo said. “He was my role
model."

I'low:vcr,oncc be started his first
year at Cornell University and began
participating in social activism on
campus such as the anti-apartheid
movement he realized that his {Ur
trite wasn't in a hospital; he had his
eyes on legil work. After graduating .
from Cornell, he begun working is
a paralegal to better understand the
legal system.

Castillo soon realized that in or—
der to be compctrtlvc for law school,
he’d have to earn an advanced dcgrcc,
Since he had never studlcd Spanish
formally outside of college, and he
wantcd a challenge, he decided to
pursuc a mastcls in Spanish

geis for law school, 1 found it to be
Very monotonous," Castillo said. “So I decided to finish my
masters degree in Spanish."

He began teaching for n yenr er the University ochnusylr
vanin, but then quickly moved to Los Angeles after winning
a fellowship at the University of California at Irvine. After
spending several yca- i the area, he moved to Tampa to live
with his ster and b. fly taught at a local community college
before coming to or nell.

As a tcicher Castillo said he tries to be as open is posr
siblc with his students. “I don't like to be an authoritative ﬁg»
utc."Castillo said.“l like to treat them as intelligent, educated
people, ike myself."

As well is a policy ofrespcct, Castillo also tries to be "as
authentic as possible" by encouraging openness betwccn him-
self ind his students. “People tend to feel relaxed talking to
me, “ Castillo said. “I’m a very friendly, approachable person,

for Cent/1c, rant types/drier Mom and «oer-iron;
“After being accepted into Rut- gal/2. spendxzwm Mr: Gall:

one olmy Italian teachers- told mc that itwas n gift, but I don't
see it as that way. I just see it as being myself,"

His openness and friendly nature is apparent through his
interactions with students and staffin the dining hall, whctll—
er he’s wearing i sweater and jeans or biking shorts. Though
his outfits have sparked conversation among students, Castillo
doesn't view his workout clothes as anything out ofthc ordir
nary, In fict, he would frcqucntly dress that way in Califorr
nia. “I’m athletically fit and l was alwnys nr the beach when

I was in California. That was my
hang out, Laguna Beach and New
Port Beach," Castillo said, “I'm not
nshnmcd of my body or anything
like that."

. When Castillo wasn't working
out, spending time at the beach. or
. working towards his graduate der
grcc, he would frequent art studios
‘ and work as an art model,

“I model,like [or painters in La

gunn Bench in the art studios. I did

. that to win extra money and because
I enjoyed it." Castillo said. “I’m not

, a good irtist, so what other way can
I contribute to the art world, be a
part of it or be near it. And that's
with offering myself as subject and
let them paint me or draw me. “

But at Grinncll, the absence
of beaches and trendy art studios
doesn‘t stop Castillo from having
fun, and he uses campus resources
as much as possible. “You probably
could see me at the gym,“ he said.
“I really enjoy lifting the weights, it
makes inc feel good.”

He even uses the dining hall be-
cause it allows him to ll‘rtcmct with
people and build strong connections

BEN BREWER wrth students. “I mostly participate

with the students, they always say,
‘Wow, you're the only professor that cats breakfast, lunch, and
dinner with us.”’ Castillo sard.

Even though Castillo is close to 40 years old, he claims
that older students thought he was a ﬁrst—year. “Most of the
students confuse me for a student, someone once told mc,‘Arc
you a freshman? I don’t know what, but when I first came
here they thought I was a student, and they still do," he snid.

Castillo is a social butterﬂy, wlrcn l1: isn't at the school he
loves to interact with the towns people. 1 befriended every
one who owns a business hero' in Grinncll, Iowa In town they
probably already know me, Castillo snid

Castillo looks at the town residents the same way he would
want them to look at him. "They tend to be really friendly
people, and you get to know them and they know you." CaSr
tillo said.

Steiner: technically responsible for the New Deal

Steiner Hall serves as home to professor offices and classrooms, but who was the man behind the building?
