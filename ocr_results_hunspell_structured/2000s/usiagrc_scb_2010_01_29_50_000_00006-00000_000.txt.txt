Sit‘l'do'wn and, listen to Jeffrey Lewis

In addition to his, socially anxious talk ballads, New York artist Jeffrey Lewis'can draw some super awesome comics

Anti-folk musician/comic book artist, jeffrey Lewis, is
not for everyone, and that’s probably the reason he’ll attract
a large crowd at Gardner this Friday. “It’s not a dance show,"
said Dane Haiken '11, who has been trying to get Lewis to
play Grinnell since last year. “It’s more of a sit»arld-think
show.”

Influenced by sospsychedelic and garage rock, as well as
his anxietyrinducing Lower East Side surroundings, Lewis
sounds like the result ofaJunn soundtrack orgy, with a little
more grit—still it is difﬁcult to fit Lewis neatly in the in-
die rock box. In addition to proudly wearing his “anti-folk"
tag,Lewis separates himself from his ‘hip' contemporaries by
showcasing his comic book art during shows.

“The most interesting thing about the show," Haiken
said, “is that [Lewis] will hold up his comics and sing an a
capella song which corresponds to the illustrations and tells
a story or evplains an historical event. For example, he has
one about the history of Communism.”

Lewis' most famous song, “Williamsburg Will Oldham
Horror," details his chance subway encounter with a man
who may, or may not, be indie rock legend Bonnie “Prince"

Billy, aka Will Oldham. As the train leaves the Lower East
Side and heads for Hipster central in Brooklyn, Lewis un»
loads his pent up anxieties and insecurities aboutalife as a
frivolous, ﬂedgling rock star onto the man who he’s pretty
sure is Oldham in hopes ofsome empathy and sageslike wise
domr Instead, Lewis is mugged and raped by rhe man, who
leaves him with nothing besides an oddly cathartic message:
“All artists are pussies.” Like I said earlier, the show probably
is not for everyone.

Despite its somewhat off-putting content, “Williamsr
burg Will Oldham Horror,"illusttates Lewis'supreme talent
as both a finger picking guitarist and a culturally literate lyr-
icist.The song is at once eloquent and catchy, witty and true.
Luckily, it is also representative of his larger body of work,
proving Lewis capable of producing stuff that will resonate
far beyond the zip up hoodie and Converse crowdieven if
they are the only ones who are listening so far

‘He makes sense to whoever is listening, Haiken said

Jeffery Lewis will be appearing solo in Gardner this Fri—
day Jan. 29 at 9 pm.

Grinnell dance abandons stage for street

BY} FRANCIS Bust:

Last December, several students, faculty and staff en-
countered seemingly impromptu dance performances across
the Grinnell Campus. No, it was not a spontaneous ﬂash
rave, and yes, they had the space reservedieven in Steiner.

Sightsspeciﬁc danceiin which a dance performance is
shaped and molded by the often untraditional place in which
it happensils no new idea for Grinnell. Last semester, Sew
cral snidents involved in rhe College’s dance troupe, a for-
credit ensemble that performs every semester, helped orga-
mze, choreograph and perform several pieces’that took place
across campus in locations from the hallways of Bucksbaum
Center for the Arts to the second floor ofStcincr HallTl-iis
semester, though, faculty members will be taking charge and
institutionalizing the style.

"Last semester the students in dance troupe created sight
dances and some of them collaborated amongst each other,
some invrted students into the works they created," Shawn
Womack. Theater, said. "And this semester} as with every
spring semester, we have faculty and guest choreographers."

Womack will be joined by Kathleen Hurley, who teach-
es a dance technique class, and architect and visual artist
Mitchell Squire, a professor of Architecture at Iowa State
University. Hurley and Squire will collaborate directly with
students to compose a series of sightrspecific dances.

“We haven't completely composed it yer because we want
to have a lot ofstudenr input into the creative process,"Hur-
le_y said “But we’re picturing that it will be kind of an epic
piece that will travel across campus to different buildings"

Squire visited Grinnell and worked with students on
their sight specific pieces last semester, bringing' in a more
unorthodox point of view on the dance performances.

“Because he's not a dancer, and he's looking at space and

architecture from a different view point, he was able to at»

ticulate to us some different ideas that we wouldn't normally
perceive when we walk into a space, like how can we interact
with it," Hurley said.

Squire, who resides in Ames, could not be reached for
comment. His work can be seen at wwmi‘tcliellsguire.com.

Squire’s work has not just transposed typical‘dance to
atypical place’s.The pieces are intentionally created with
thought given to the function of the place. Squire focused
largely on what Eleanor Nelson ’10 called “transitory spac—
es," such as the cubbies and doors of the JRC,

Eleanor Nelson ’10 participated in the choreographing
and performing ofa sighespecific dance last semester that
took place in the doorways ofthe JRC at noon, highlighting
the way the space is used and how those who move “through

“It's a very different performance experience from when
you just learn a piece, rehearse and perform,” Nelson said,
adding that instead of a.ticketed spectators "much of [the]
audience is usually happen-stance."

Kristen Moreland '12,who also participated in the Dance
Troupe last semester, embraces the mutations between pert
former and viewer. one performance took place late at night
in the commonsspaces ofNoyce Science Center, as students

SOPHIE FAJARDO

trickled through on their way to attend Winter Waltz. “The
point was to disrupt the flow,"Mordand said.

And with the juxtaposition of science laboratories, stur
dents in formal wear and dancers consciously using a space
few would associate with dance, the flow was certainly disc
rupted. ’

The, dance troupe will spend rho rest ofrhe semester cho-
rcographing and rehearsing, wirli performances planned for
early May.
