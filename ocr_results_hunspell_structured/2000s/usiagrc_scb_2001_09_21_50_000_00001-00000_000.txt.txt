According [oWllllams, closing Quad

Dining services recenrly rnade ihe de.
cision ro reopen Qucd on weekends,
however, becausc orshorrages in scatlng

neerly double rhe previous norm,

In sddrrion ro rhis change, dining
services cur rlre nuinher orsrudenr em.

Because of rhese srair curs, rhe re»

"Employee morale is doing poorly,”
said Cowles employee Ben Holcomb ‘04.
“There is a lor orunhappiness [because]
workload has increased per person quire
a hir.”

According ro Holcomb. a shift super.
visor orrcn works in rhc kirchen heeaose

Addirionally, n srudenr unloading

last year, dining services wcnr over
hodger. How much rhey wenr ovcriand
how much rhey were required ro cut rhis
year—ls "nor necessarily a secret," Will-
iams said specific derails are nor public,
however, because dnungserviccs does nor
wanr “each irenr [in rlre budget] up for
dcbaie."

Williams added rher orher places on
cornpus also wenr over hudger hsr ycnr,

This is nor a crisis, he sold.

Despire rhc hiidger curs dining scrv

Dining services also ronririues ro or.

Whar to spend money on, he added,

There are addirlolnl concerns in dlnr
ing services. “Quad is overcrowded every
day orrhe week," Willmms said. “Ovelr
crowding is :in indiearron tlm we need a
new leeiliry where we can accommodare
[ihe nuiuher oisrudenrs diningl."

Dining services “can'r jusr do every»

:Xplzlned.

"ln food service, 100% orrhe people
ere never happy", he added, “We do an
excellcnr .oh.“

“People objecr ro rhe whole concepr
or change on campus," Williams said,
“Anyrirne rlreie's 2 change, somebody
Won’t like it." Dining services will “2rd-

just and adspr" unril rhings work, he said,

Because so many on—umpus jobs are
in dining services, changes hove alrecred

According re Enumzn, rhe rercnrien
