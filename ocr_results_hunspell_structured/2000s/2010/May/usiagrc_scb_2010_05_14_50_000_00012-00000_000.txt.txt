“They say: that the dingedong
daddies from Dibble scored a big-
get hit with the wimmin man did
the pep band from Clark (how did
that get in?) But even Dib ale men
wouldn’t have to applaud them—
selves. Whistling and yapping are
okey at a ball game, but waen it
comes to sereneades—the gals want
romance. In some colleges, Set»
enades are Something.”

Let’s selfegov out shit when next Friday comes and
keep the plastic outllouscs at least passably clean. A
little aim, some TP, and a steadying hand go a long
way. Also, hand saniaeer: bring some. Alotta people
touch those beer taps.

You may remember an article a few weeks
ago about the men’s ultimate Frisbee team qualie
tying for Regionals for the ﬁrst thne since zoos,
There was no mention in that article about the
women's team, who not only qualiﬁed for that
same tournament, but also for the ﬁrst ever Divi-
sion-III National Championship. 1 would write
an article myself about how this has been the
best season Grinnell women's ultimate has ever
had and how everyone on the team has worked
hard to make it to the national level, but I'm a
taptairi ofthat team and so that would bejour-
nallsdtally unethital. So a random rant it is.
