Trustee helps Lauren Ba-
con get med-prep program

Lauren Bacon would have never come to Grinnell College ifir
was not for the Posse scholarship Program. As a member of Los
Angeles Posse IV, Bacon made the most of her time in Iowa by
majoring in both Spanish and biological chemistry.

She knows her accomplishments are in part due to the LA.
Posse 1 class, who were seniors when Lauren was just starting
tutorial.

"There's a very like, ‘Big Brothers Big Sisters' thing with Posse,
as they were graduating they were giving me advice on what to do,"
Bacon said. "I remembel’ one student who was graduating I told
her I was really interested in the sciences, but I also wanted to be
a Spanish major, and she told me ‘Whatever you put your mind to,
you can do it, and they will support you.”

Thanks to her hard work at Grinnell, Bacon will be heading
to a Post Baccalaureate Medical Preparation Program or “Medr
Prep" for short, at Southern Illinois University of Carbondale.The

program will last two years and is designed to prepare Bacon for
medical school by giving her a chance to raise her G,P.A., perform
research and shadow a physician.

one trustee, Dr. Robert Austin ’54, played a critical role
in Lauren’s post graduate plans by writing her a letter of
recommendation and strongly suggesting the Carbondalc program.

“He had already sent two or three other students through that
same program that are already now in medical school and one of
them already graduated," Bacon said.

When asked why she did not go straight to medical school
trom Grinnell, Bacon cites her desire to be completely ready for its
rigorous coursework

“To me, med school is something that is a real challenge,"
Bacon said, “I want to be prepared {or it, I never want tojump into
something without knowing what I'm going to get myself into,"

state of California,

though due to recent

studies in Costa Rica

and Ecuador, Bacon is still unsure otwhot type of doctor she would
like to become.

“I, for a while, had been settling on being an OB/GYN,” Bacon
said. "After being in Costa Rica and Ecuador, where I mostly
worked in emergency rooms, 1 really really want to be an E R.
doctor.”

The decision becomes even more complicated when Bacon
factors our llcr desires and considers what is currently in the
highest demand.

“What’s needed the most right now are family practitioners and
physicians," Bacon said. “To me, being a doctor is not about I
want to be an ER. doctor or an OB/GYN. I want to be a doctor to
help people so if that requires that I have to become physician
especially to help low income communities, which is where I want
to work.Then to me, it is worth it,”

According to Bacon, due to the pivotal medical experience the
two Latin American countries have given her, she feels she must
return as a doctor to both Ecuador and Costa Rica to give back,

Despite her intense course load, Lauren has found time to
participate in campus groups including the Young Gifted and
Black Gospel Choir, Student Organization ofLatinos/Latinas, the
Spanish SEPC and Ace Security. Some of her most memorable
moments at Grinnell have happened while working security

“Grinnellians, when they get drunk, oh my god," Bacon said. "I
just have so many stories catching people having sex in the back
ofthe stage area, in the movie theatre, in where the pool table is. I
found a bag ofcocaine once."

Now that Lauren is ready to walk at commencement and take
the beneﬁts of her hard work and memories with her, she realizes
her graduation means something to more than just her.

"My dad never graduated from college," Bacon said. “I know he
really, really wanted to."

Considering that the greatest consolation for not achieving
one's desires is enabling someone else to fulﬁll theirs, Lauren is
incredibly grateful when reﬂecting on how far she’s come.

“11’: the greatest aeeomplishment 1 have up to this point. It
you would have asked me in high school, I didn’t even think about
college. My high school was a public school in LA. My parents are
the ones who really put me in programs to help me get to college.”
