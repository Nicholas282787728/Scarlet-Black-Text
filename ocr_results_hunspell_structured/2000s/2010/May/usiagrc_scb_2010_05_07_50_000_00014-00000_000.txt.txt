Kunal signs off with everybody’s favorite: soccer

I'm not going to lie; when I found out I was writing my
last column orthe school year this week, I became a little emor
uonal. When I first told my sports—crazy family that I would
be writing a sports opinion column {or the seals, way '
back in August, they literally laughed in my face. I
can still remember my sister sneering, “Why would
you want to write about something nobody at
Grinnell cares about?" I really didn't care; I was
going to get paid for doing something I often did
in my spare time anyways—shameless plug for
my blog: yellingfromcouch.blogspot.com. How»
ever, as the school year progressed, and I wrote a
few columns,l found that Gi‘inncllians do care,

It is safe to say that most students on this
campus do not follow sports regularly, but that
has not stopped them from appreciating the merit
of the work that fellow SGB columnist, Kramer
McLuckie, and I put out every week. I can't
tell you how many people have come up to
Kramer or me and said something along
the lines of, "Hey Kunal/Kramer, I really
enjoyed your article this week, I just wish
I knew/cared more about sports so I could
appreciate it that much more." Encounters
like this make me so happy; not only do
they reassure me that people do, in fact, care
about what I have to say, but irI can pique
the interest of people who don't even care
about sports, I must be doing something rightTo wrap up this
sappy, Rick Reilly-esque, portion of my column so we can get
to the good stuff, Ijust wanted to say, “Thank you for reading,
Grinnell, you're awesome."

Sports take on a global theme this summer, as the best SOC-
cer players in the world head to South Africa for the 2010
World Cup. The big story in this region of Planet Earth, of
course, is the potential success of the Americans in a route
nament, and in a sport {or that matter, that they notoriously
struggle in. There is good reason for Americans to have high
expectations; not only did the US. make an improbable run

to the Confederations Cup Final last summer, in which they
beat Spain and lost to Bray after leading at halftime, but they
also drew a pretty good group for World Cup pool play (Eng
land, Algeria, and Slovenia). However, I'm not going
to talk about us. soccet’s potential exploits in the
World Cup a this ti topic that’s going to get bear
to death by sports media outlets over the next
month or 50.1 am more interested in the World
Cup prospects of the six teams that will play
in their home continent: Cameroon, Ghana,
Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Algeria, and or course,
South Africa,

Africa is ii soceerreraay eonrinent, and it
hopes the World Cup will serve as a coming~
our party orsorrs for its immensely talented, but
perennially underachieving national teams. Ivory
Coast, Ghana, and Cameroon are the class orthe
Six African nations that will compete in South
Africa. Pretty much every fan of the UEFA
Champions League, or the Electronic Arts'
FIFA video game series, knows the names of
Didier Drogba,Michacl Essien, and Samuel
Eto’o, star players for Ivory Coast, Ghana,
and Cameroon respectively However, these
teams are actually fairly well rounded, espe-
cially Ivory Coast, which boasts the talents
of Salomon Kalou (another Chelsea star)
and defensive midﬁelders Didier Zokora
and Yaya Toure. Cameroon also boasts a number otEuropeanr
based professmnals, such as Arsenal midﬁelder Alex Song and
Mallorca forward Pierre Webo, Ghana doesn’t quite boast the
same amount of riches as Ivory Coast and Cameroon, but does
feature Inter Milan midﬁelder Sulley Muntari, and a solid de-

rensive pairing ofJohn Mensah and John Pantsli.

Although these three nations might be the best Africa has
to offer, they drew three otthe hardest groupings for pool play.
Ivory Coast drew Group G, the proverbial (Group of Dcarh,’
which includes the likes of Brazil, Portugal, and North Korea.
Iflvory Coast drew the hardest group, Ghana drew the most

well rounded; Group B contains the likes of Germany, Serbia,
and Australia in addition to the Ghanese. Cameroons group,
teaniring the Netherlands, Denmark,aiid Jap.in,does not seem
as haid as Ivory Coast's or Ghan ' However,one must keep in
mind that Denmark has played fantastic in World Cup Qualr
fying, beating Sweden and drawing Portugal,

Ivory Coast will play each one of their opponents tough,
but in the end, asking a team making its second ever World
cup appearance to beat out either Brazil at Portugal for a
spot in the knockout round is a lirrle too much. Cameroon can
certainly advance itrhey play well, but an aging roster and a
very poor showing in the African Nations Cup this pastwinrer
leaves me with little conﬁdence that the Lions can beat our
Denmark for that second advanemg spot behind Holland. As
for Ghana, their hopes really depend on the health orstar mid-
fielder Michael Essien, who may not be fully recovered rrom
a knee Injury sustained in World Cup Qialifying, in time to
play in the actual World Cup. Even with Essien, Ghana really
does not boast It whole lot of striking talent, whith could spell
doom against German and Serbian squads that can score a lot
ofgoiils in a hurry

Honestly, I believe that the only African nation that will
advance to the knockout stage is Nigeria; perhaps the 4th
or 5th best team in the continent. Nigeria also drew a tough
group, featuring Argentina, South Korea and Greece. How—
ever, a second place finish in this group for Nigeria is more
than feasible, considering that South Korea and Greece have
played horrendous of late, while the Super Eagles played well
at the Africa Cup of Nations this past winter, ﬁnishing third.
Furthermore, unlike Nigerian teams of the past, the current
Super Eagles play a very slow-paced, defensive-minded game,
scoring few goals. but allowing fewer. This strategy could work
very well in playing the runnandngun Argentinians, the one
behemoth the Nigerians will face in pool play, to a draw. It’
the Nigerians can eke out a second place finish in Group B,
they would then take on the champion ofGroup A, which will
likely be Mexico or France. Nigeria would be the underdog in
either situation, but hey, I’ve seen home-turf advantage work
stranger mysteries,
