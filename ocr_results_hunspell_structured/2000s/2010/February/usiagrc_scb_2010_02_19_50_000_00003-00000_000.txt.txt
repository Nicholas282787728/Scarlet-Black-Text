vehicle to 5 read democrac . Morozov [ans to
p 2010?)! p

release a book Fall of entatively titled

Big Brother in a Small World. His writin s

have appeared in The New York Times e

Economist and Newsweek International. Max

Calenberg from the 8&8 sat down with Morozov
, to discuss the Internet and the actions of its

major playerr.

How did you become interested in the
Internet and its effect on people’s ability to
revolt or rebel?

I essentially became interested in new media
and blogging...four or five years a lot—back
then there was a lot of interest an it Just was a
year aﬁer the revolution in Ukraine and there
was a lot of interest in how you can actually use
technology and new media to‘spread democracy
further in the region and that includes Belarus
where I was from originally. So I started

blog i_ng about events in Belarus in En lish for
an on me magazme based in the Czech epublic.

Why do you think it’s taken people in the U.S.
so long, until something like he use oI’IWitter
durin the Iranian election protests, to realize
that t e Internet is a means to rebel against a
government when it has been so prominently
used in Eastern Europe for so long?

In Eastern Euro e there is still this livin
tradition ofrevo ution, since 1989. In 1 89..
some more communication tools were used
quite activel ._ People used Xerox machines

and fax mac mes and there was this kind of
understanding that technologg can actually help,
and a lot of people were supp ying fundingi
including the U.S.A govemment—in Poland

to buy Xerox machines and to buy technology
so there was deﬁnitely an understanding that
technologyrcan play a role There’s a lot ofmore
understanding when it’s China or Iran, which
are in the headlines There is, of course, more
and more attention being aid to these issues
Simply because they are hina and Iran. So at
this point there is definitely a realization in the
US. that something is happening but I think that
understanding is pretty sha low.

One interesting casein Internet censorshi is

Australia, where you have a country that is a

constitutional democracy but the have fairl

hheatvy internet censorshipr Why 0 you thin
a is.

It’s notjust Australia, if we look at many
governments in Western Europe they are
cracking down on what’s happening onliiie.
France just passed a law last Weekgthc famous
three strikes and ou’re out law—where basically
ifyou’re caught ownloading something illegal
on the Internet three times the Will baSically
disconnect you. The details 0 that are not ve
well worked out because the lawjust passed.rlt’s
not very easy to completely disconnect someone.
The same sort of thing. is happening in Britain.
Looking at a country ike Russia toda , Russia
has less censorship than Australia, an even the
United Kin dom, and it poses all sorts of weird
questions Ii e whether some the authoritarian _

ovemments have found new ways of controlling
t e Internet which goes beyond censorship or
whether our Western democracies are failin so
badly that they need censorship as part of t eir
operation.

Where do you think the idea that we have a
right to remain anonymous on the Internet
stems from?

I think it comes from our legal tradition. And it
comes from general customs and expectations
and it’s sort of insurant in the constitution.

But, imagine I am driving down the road, I
have the right to do that anonymously, but the
minute I crash I completely lose my right to
be anonymous.

Yes, but it doesn’t mean the government has a
right to monitor on preemptively before you
crash into somet mg. Imagine you are growmg
marijuana in our garden and a police helico ter
fliesover an sees it. The courts have ruled . at
this is alright to use this eVidence because it is a
common airspace. _But then there was a different
case where the police used heat waves to see if
there is something growm in your house and
courts found that it s not 0 ay, that they have no
right to do it, whether you are breaking a laW‘or
not. We have to be very~ careful With a thing like
this because there are ig risks that we are not
fully aware of simply because there is so much
data out there

Just last week Goo le released Buzz and there
was a lot of backlas due to its lack of privacy
protection, do you think they were wrong in
imglementing a service that took so many

ac ons without the users’ direct permission?

What really struck me most about Google Buzz
was that the linked different Goo 1e serVices,
they linked mail with Picasa wit Google
Reader and if on think about it you can make
an argument t at is all in the pub ic alread , by
mixing data from three streams that are pu lic

already you are not creating anything new
but I_ would argue that’s not the case, because
that is how databases are made. If you gather
a database of banal details about someone it
doesn’t make a banal database.

Do ou think that Goo le owes its allegiance
to i s users to protect t eir privacy, or "‘91
government comes to them saying ‘we want
all you’ve got on this person because we think
he ma be a criminal, they should hand over
the in ormation?

I think Google owes it allegiances to their
shareholders. [think it’s a mistake to think of
these new Internet companies as some sort of
NGOs [Non-Governmental Organizations],
which happen to make money on the side,
That’s not iow they function. And Google
doesn’t really havegother than this mysterious
moral of‘don’t be evil,‘ and a very nice

mission statement ‘to or anize all the world's
information’fbut then start thinkin about it
I don’t know ifl want to organize all t e world’s
information, thereareall sorts of eople and
subjects. So there is kind ofa catc ti ht there.
I think Google’s logic is kind of base on some
ﬂawed argument that by givino people exposure
to info they Will somehow make them to aspire
to freedom and democracy.

There has been talk from several camps of
making individuals get a sort of license to
surf the internet like driving a car. Do you
think this could be a solution?

A plausible solution to What? I don’t see a
problem yet.

I guess it would address child pornography,
li el and privacy. Basically if you have a
quick way to kee someone accountable they
Will he must less ikely to break the law.

We have ways to do it, we now delegate all

of that to [S s [Internet SerVice Providers]

and [theyf]1 are supposed to locate those people
through t eir records. Its ~not like we are pinning
out o eople to put on trial. I actually think it
would e a pretty terrible solution to a problem
that for the most part doesn’t exist.

What is your stance on net neutrality?

That is a difficult one and it’s something I
haven’t reall deCided myself. 0n the one hand,
ou have to how What cate ory to put the
ntemet in Is it some'kind 0 national resource?
How do you maria c it? Does it suffer from
common use? May 6 the Way to think about
the Internet is that it’s always there, and if we
start rationing it we need to start callin it ‘
something else It has the ['1th to exist, Lit it’s
something else. I think that asn’t been prhperly
understood. The practical understanding 0
the Internet is_ so weak.— we don’t know how
to conceptualize these issues. We are stuck
with the issue of whether we should encourage
competition and sort of let companies do
Whatever they want or Just say yes you can do
whatever you want. If you define it by the set of
experience there is no way that you can sort of
make an argument that we’ll be regulating and
the people who download more v1 eos W1 1 be
punished and Cpeo 1e who download more text
will be rewar ed. y own View is that it IS 3
probably a set of experience that does include
some sort ofnotion of infini , and we should
somehow work around it an put it into law.
