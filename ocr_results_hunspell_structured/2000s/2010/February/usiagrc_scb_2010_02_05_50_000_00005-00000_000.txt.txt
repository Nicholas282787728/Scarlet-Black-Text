New location, new food, more games, but the old Lonnski’s Charm remains

. BYJAI Gaxc
Most businesses don’t last long at 910 Main St. George’s
closed down two years ago and Jimbo’s only lasted a year in
the space. Lonn Leas hopes that third time is the charm for
Lonnski’s Pub and Deli.

In early December, Lonn Leas was told that he would
have to relocate his establishment due to the stmctural insta-
bility of the ﬂoor. Luckily for Leas, a storefront had opened
up just a few doors down due to the closing of Jimbo’s.

“We didn't have a choice about moving, [this location] was
bigger and more visible," Leas said. “There really wasn’t ans
other place that had a kitcheniwe would have had to build
one
Though Lonnski’s took over the shell of the old Jimbo’s,
an average observer would not be able to tell. The new loca—
tion looks like the old back alley establishment, except with
more items on the menu and expanded entertainment options.

“we've added several menu items in each category," Leas
said. “We added a full burger section. We didn’t want to take

.Grinnell resident Jonathan Lacina, a 21eyear—old graphic
, design major at Iowa State Universityms reported missing by
his father on Jan 30 after he was unable to establish contact
with his son for a week,

Lacins was last seen leaving a small party at a friend's
apartment in Ames the ' ofJanuaiy 22. He was said to
have heenin “good spirits" and unlikely to do harm to himself
or others when he left the party. As for the possibility of over
intoxication, oiiicials say that although alcohol was served at
the party, it is unclear if Lacina was intoxicated at the time of
his departure.

Following the report, a search party of 250 people, plus
a search helicopter and diving team has been deployed. Iowa
State University spokeswoman Annette Hacker told AOL
News, “The search on Saturday and Sunday included ground
ateas in and around campus. Police searched wooded areas,
culverts, ditches, local waterways'and the cross-country ﬁeld."

anything away—just beef it up."

New items on the menu include sour cream and chives
fries, the Hawaiian barbecue chicken, the beef and mushroom
melt and the Smothered Queso Burger.

“The Chleso Burger was pretty good," said Tucker Bush
'12.“Eut it deﬁnitely did not compare to the Buffalo Chicken."

In addition to the all the new items on the food menu,
Lonnski's has expanded the size of the bar and has added PBR
on tap. ,
“We now have domestic beer on tap and are doing pitch:
ers now, and we now have a full game room with a pool table
and darts," Leas said. “There wasn’t anywhere else that oﬁered
these amenities and had a warm family friendly environment."

The expansion of the bar and added entertainment are ac-
companied by a larger focus on keeping the bar open longer
hours and servicing the college community

“Something that stuck out in my mind was when putting
in the game room was that whenever I ms at the [Down Un-
der] Pub was that people were always throwing darts, playing

Iowa State goes missing

As of Monday, backhoes and dogs were used to search
through remote areas around the Iowa State campus as well as

through the accumulating snow piles, though to no avail,

Iowa State Police ChiefJerry Stewart said investigators plan
to continue speaking with Lacina's family and acquaintances in
hopes of rttricving clues surrounding his disappearance and

- current whereabouts, Although neither Lacirla’s cell phone nor
ATM curd have been used since the night ofhis disappearance,
investigators will also continue to' monitor his electronic trail.

To raise public awareness and gain helpful information,
Ladna’s friends have created the Facebook group, “Help Find
John Latina!" Accordin to AOL News, Lucina was last seen
wearing a black coat an blue jeans. He is 5 feet, 11 inches tall,
155 pounds, with brown hair and green eyesAnyonc with in

pool and foosball,” Leas said. “I thought that was a void that
I could ﬁll."

After being in hibernation for about a month, Lonnski's
ﬁnally opened up last Monday to a constant ﬂow of people.

“Dealing with being overly busy is much bener than the
alternative," Leas said. “Our opening coincided with the com—
munity theater and the high school formal, but the ﬁrst cou—
ple ofdays of this week has been busy as well."

While 'there have been some hurdles with the new locav
lion, overall it has gone very well.

"I would say 90 percent ofthe peo it that came in last
week had the experience that we wante them to have,“ Leas
said. “There deﬁnitely were some situations, but it's been ex-
actly like we hoped it to be.”

The larger space has been well received by many members
of the community.

“I like how the new Lonnski’s looks, it is a lot bigger," said
Graciela Guzman '11. “It was nice because there was more
space and now you can see people and there are more booths.-
