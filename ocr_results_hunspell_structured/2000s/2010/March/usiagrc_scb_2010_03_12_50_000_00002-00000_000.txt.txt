library storage facility is helping to alleviate die burden on Burling,
as well as the completion of the Kistle Science Libniry, housed in
the Noyce science Building, as noted in the original plan. Except
for the new library, President Osgood says the plan has essentially
been completed

‘We still have our drawing boards up but we don't have the
money right now, Osgood said

Currently, there are three additional projects in the works—
a wind farm, a new preschool and renovating Grinndl House to
make it differently abled accessible

Another aspect of recent renovations that was not a pan of the
original campus plan is the coon to increase sustainabilityand mak-
ing the College’s buildings more green.

”The other thing that we have spent a lot more money on than
we would have projected back then is sustainability, Osgood said.
“We have put a giant well ﬁeld of geothermal wells for the athletic
center, and we did get LEED [Leadership in Energy and Environ
mental Design] ccniﬁcnlion for some ofout larger projects."

Osgood said that future geothermal facilities will probably be
built for a new preschool and presdaool laboratory for the Psychol-
ogy department, as well as for the new library, if one were to be built.

The wind farmithe last ofthe three current projects—is cur-
rently delayed due to the economic downturn

"We estimate that the wind farm will cost 57 million,” Osgood
said. ‘And thats the most expensive of the current big projects, ext
cept the new library

“The wind project continues to move forward and discussion is

ongoing regarding funding of die project,"Voss said.

Osgood estimates that a new campus plan Will be made soon,
once all of the new facilities have been completed and open for use
for a period orsime.

"We have tried to make great strides in accessibiliry in our fat
cilincs, and we want to make our whole campus greener and more
environmentally responsible," Osgood said. “We have made great
progress in both orthose, but they are not done. I would guess that
in the non three to ﬁve years, the campus will make a new campus

Pm ,

- Inaddition to makingthe campus greener and more accessible, '

the new campus plan will look at classroom needs, and the library
needs orthe humanities and social sciences. A campus plan update

'is currently in the works.

“President Osgood was instrumental in overseeing the substanr
rial changes that the campus has seen over the years,"riammer said.
“The dining hall and the athletic facility are the two big structural
dranges that come to mind."

When askcd ifhe has any advice for Dr, Kington on the next
carripus plan, President Osgood said it was his personal view that
the out-gomg president should not overwhelm the incoming one.
However, Osgood says that he will write reports that he will leave
[or Dr. Kington to do with what he wants.

“He can rip them up, tile them, whatever he wishes," Osgood
said. .

Printing charges

under consideration

BY SOLOMON MILLER

A tree needs to be cur down almost every day to accommOs
date student printing at Grinnell, based on a 2003 survey from the
University of Colorado applied to Grinnell student body paper
usage, Grinnell is trying to cut down student printing instead,

To reduce otceseive printing, Information Technology ser-
vices (ITS) is considering charging students for each printed page,
starting next semester. Many students arcingalnst this plan and
think that their concerns have been ignored.

students will pay roughly live cents per single sided page and
about as much for each double~sided page, according to William
Francis, Director or 11‘s. Students will be given a quota on the
scale of300- 500 free pages each year

The plan, in its current form, involved installing a system
called Papercut." When students print from a public computer,
they will need to authorize the print job by swiping their P card
at a release station near the printer. Students will be charged on
a new account that will be installed on P cards expressly for this
purpose The startup cost of Papercut for the rights and the card
readers will be over 350, 000 according to Francis.

The ﬁnal decision will likely be made this summer, according
to Francis and other sources. As a test, a color laser printer that is
not currently public may be opened to student use with the new
system over Spring Break

Dylan Sather '10, SGA Technical Advisor, agrees with the
goals of ITS. "There's no reason we shouldn’t try to save as much
paper as we can, sather said

However, sather believes charging students is the wrong way
to reduce paper waste. Student printing makes up only ﬁve percent
of the college’s total printing budget, according to Sather

Moreover, Saul-let and others, such as SGA Vice President of
Student Affairs Ben Offenberg ’11, feel that administrators are
not doing enough to prioritize student concerns,

"Primarily it's been srudents going to ITS and asking them
questions: onenberg said. “They have not actively come to us to
solicit our input, we ve had to go to them."

“An ybody that wants to meet about it or send information—
dints ﬁne, I 11 ﬁnd the time to do that, Francis said. He has met
widi various students, including SGA leaders. according to Frans

‘cis and members of SGA.

However, the only contact with students that he initiated was
one talk at aloint Board meeting. according to Francis.

Like Otrenberg, Sather wants ITS to more actively seek our
student opinions

“They should have done a lot more, and they can still do a lot
more to seek out student feedback," Sathcr said. “We shouldnt
have to make the eEort to go out to them."

According to a student initiative passed last semester, most
students are against printing charges, 83 percent of die student
body nﬂinned, “the student campus community opposes the act
ccptability of charging for printing as a cost saving mechanism."

Sclfsintcrcst isn't the only reason students oppose the change.
A primary concern is that ﬁnancial aid, as it is currently structured,
will not pay for the academic printing needs afstudcnts who can't
afford the atria. fee,

“It would disadvantage lower socioeconomic status students,"
Ottenberg slud. “VVhlch is something that Grmndl goes out of
our wayiby offering things like free printingilo not do."

According to Francis, he has not yet worked with the olﬁcc of
ﬁnancial aid to solve this problem.

The new system will face other problems as well. Students
may aimid the cost by printing to semi—public printers, including
the SGA printer and department printers, which would not be a
part of the new system, according to Offenberg.

Also. according to Francis, there is currently no plan to accoms
modarc the needs orsnrdent groups. Many student groups rely
on posters printed in bulk to notify the campus of their activities,

Snthcr says he has proposed alternative to printing costs dint
may help reduce wasteful printing without the same negative cf
iecls.

“It could be a great system irwe just implement a few changes.
both institutionally and personally," Sathcr said. His suggcstions
include installing print release stations with no charge to students

Fruicis cited a survey orcoinpanible colleges which sitys in-
stalling such a system with no charge would reduce piint‘lng costs,
but not by .is much

To cncouragc a productive discussion, orienbtrg, Sather and
others recently Dformed the ITS Advisory Committee. Students
and administrators, including Fnuicis, will meet regularly to disc
oiss ITS policies.

After this week’s meeting, OFEenberg is optimistic that the
committee with help “open a communication channel between
ITS and the studént body that really hasn’t existed before."

Any student with suggestionspn how to decrease wasteful
printing can get involved by talking to Francis or Offenberg.
