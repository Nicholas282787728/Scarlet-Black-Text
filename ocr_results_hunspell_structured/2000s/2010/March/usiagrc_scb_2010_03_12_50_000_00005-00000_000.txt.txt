Vivian Girls may party harder than Disco

BY ClllllSTlAN Citlvlan-i

This Saturday at 8p.m., Vivian Girls
will add their name to the list of Pitch-
fork performers who later found their
way to Gardner Lounge. The allrfemale,
Brooklynrbased band has stirred an u“;
usual excitement amongst students, which
seems rooted in something deeper than
the Girls' burgeoning fame. Chair of the
Concerts Committee, Alex Schechter '10,
attributes the widely felt anticipation for
the show to the band’s unique mixing of
genre and contagious intensity.

“They have an- exciting energy,"
Schechter said. “I didn't think shoegaze
and surf—rock were compatible, but they
make it work,” i

Vivian Girls’ eponymous debut album
is unapologetically noisy and, at the same
time, unobtrusively bashful. Somewhere,
in the torrents of chaos, buried under the
cacophony and feedback,.is a small, melm
dious voice which wants both to be heard
and not to interrupt. It’s heartbreaking
in a way, but the Girls seem well—adjusted
(especially forBrooklyn!) and by the end

of each song their various indignarions
are shruggingly deferred a in Scarlet
O’Hara—"After all, tomorrow’s anoth»
er day.” The album isn't all shoegazerv
though, as the ub'er-
dancey ﬁnal track “I
Believe in Nothing‘
gleefully insists. Nir
hilism, an oft-quot»
ed man once said,
must be exhausting.
For Vivian Girlsia
trio of Dudettes,if1
may~it’s also a hell
'of a lot of fun.

The Girls
sophomore effort,
“Everything Goes
Wrong," features a
higher level of co-
hesion and polish, as
well as a more confi-
dent voice that, per-
haps, can be attributed to the success of
the first album.That being said, “Every-
thing"still manages to retain that bizarre

surf-rockiest, the Girls can’t take a break
from some introspection and brutal selfr

honesty ‘

Vivian Girls’influences, some obvious
and some not, are eclectic to say the least:
The Wipers, Nirvana, The Ramones,
Crazy Horse and Burt Bacharach (who
lead singer Cassie Ramon: calls “the best
songwriter ever." Hm.) Having grown up
in an afﬂuent New Jersey suburb, bands
like Blink 182 and NOFX also made their
way into the Girls' early musical con-
sciousness. It was only after mistakenly
stumbling on The Germs’ “Lexicon DeVr
il"while'surfing Napster that the seeds of
hardcore punk were sown. And, if you've
ever seen Vivian ‘Girls live, you know
those punk seeds are now in full bloom.

“The show will be raucous, fun and
upbeat," Schechter said. “They're becomr_
ing a bigger name and people will be able
to say, ‘I saw them at Grinnell.’ Also, I
don’t know if you can write this, but we
got a keg."

Vivian Girls will be playing with Male
Bonding in Gardner Lounge at 8 pm. on
Saturday.

. At 7:30 pm on Friday and Saturday and 2:00 pm. on sun-
day in Roberts Theater, Grinnell actors will performkbut not like
your typical inainstageThe playwill last no longer than 45 minutes.
They will not recite monologues or pause for laughter, They will
present “Flowers ofE,"an image-based hascd'performance inspired
by “The Flowers of Evil,"poel:ry ofCharles Baudelaire.

Director Craig O‘uinterofheatet and Dance. chose Baudelaire
for his dynamic emotional expression. “Baudelaire’s poetry is dark,
evocative, brooding. but also, frail and human," (hunter said. “It's
tough writing, and because it’s_tough, it’s moving"

Although the show grew from this textual influence and the.
anal producr includes poetic recirations, rehearsals began with no
script and no rig-id plantThe play is intentionally the result ofongor
ing artistic wllnboratlon.Tlae images and moments that form the
piece were entirely devised over the course of the rehearsal process.
The director, designers, actors and a group of visiting Taiwanese
perfonnets experimented and engaged with one anorherin the cre-
ation of different visual speciacles,“Vl/e were able to draw ﬁom the
collective creativity ofeveryone involved,” actress Gillian Hemme
Y10 said. '

From collaboration to the stage, imagerbased performance dis-
tinguishes itself from conventional drama in many ways. It is free
from the boundaries of a script or even a concrete deﬁnition of in
own aims. Traditional acting techniques are our the window “Per-
formers in Craig’s show are just like the light—they’re something
that exists on thesrage," professional dancer Li-Mei Chung said.

‘1: all comes together. You dont know the recipe, but suddenly, ev»

The resulting imagery, described by watchers as “chilling,"
“beautiful" and “unforgettable" in turn, does not produce a clear
or simple message. but encourages the audience to create one all its
own. “This show reveals what’s happening inside ofus—the music
ofeveryday life,”Quintero said.

Grinnell is only the ﬁrst stop in a series ofintemarional perfor-
mances. over spring Break the images created here in Iowa will
travel to Paris with a new company of actors. InJllne, “Flowers ofE"
will move to Taiwans National ExperimentalThcntcr, and ﬁnally.in
