and film in the US

Where did youi: interest in
Violence and crime stem from?

I was looking for something to

do my masters thesis about and

I wrote about a famous case in
England called the Moors Murders
that involved a man and a woman
pair of killers in the 19505 who _
were conVicted of a series of child
murders. And_What appealed to me
about the subject was that I’m born
a first generation college family and
I wanged to do something that would
be of interest of eople outside the
academy. The 9 er thin was I’d
grownup reading crime iction and
true crime booksand the idea that

I could sort of bring my interests
together With my academic work
was really appealing to me,

And what about your interest in
celebrity did you develop that
separate y or did that sort of form
in conju ation with your interest
in serial 'llers?

Really more of the second, what
happens was, when I moved the
States to do in Ph.D., not long aﬁer
I moved here, ’d been thinking
about doing something about
serial killers but I hadn’t deCided
what. But not lon aﬁer I moved
here, “Silence of t e Lambs” was
released, and there was that big
Oscar ceremony when “Silence
of the Lambs" won all the major
cate ones. That whole ceremony
was aSically organized around
Hannibal Lecter around that _
character. So, when I was watching
that I thought what on Earth is

om on here? How can a character
ike s be such a big deal in pop
culture? And then; there were several
other hlgh'publlclig cases around
the same time. An‘ so it ust seemed
to me like something ha ha ened
that needed to be explained. o
the stuff about celebrity really
emerged as I was looking for Was.
to explain What was happening With
seria killers. The twot ings came
together.

Do you think that “Silence of the
Lambs” was a turning point for

serial killers and violence in pop
culture in the US?

Totall . I mean that’s when it really
sort 0 went into the mainstream big
time. I mean it hap ened a little bit
before, anybody W o is a true crime
fan knows about the books of Ann
Rule and her most famous book is
about this gu called Ted_Bundy
called “The hanger BeSide Me”...
but I think “Silence of the Lambs”

demonstrated to the pop culture
industry at large that there were
huge amounts of money to be made
from this. And it also sort of made
it ok to be into serial killers. It made
it kind of hip and trendy, it was
definitely a turning point.

Do you think that since that film
there have been any film or ﬁlms
that have had as bigot an effect
on evil and violence.

I_really think that everything

Since then has. been, in one way or
another, bmldin on the success of
“Silence of the ambs”~what that
did was to establish a formula that
a lotof other programs in different
media were a Ie to follow. Let me
give you an exam le. Probably in
terms of success at really sticks
out is “Dexter.” If you think about
that uses the same formula of
“Silence ofthe Lambs” in a way. In
each season of “Dexter” ou‘ve got
a cod serial killer and a ad one.
T e good one is Dexter, and that‘s
who it’s ok to identi With and then
you‘ye ot the ev11 c aracter. And
that is t e one that we go ‘boo hiss’
and we don’t need to bother with
them. So in other words, “Dexter”
has really solved that problem that
“Silence of the Lambs ‘ solved for
the first time—how do you get_
audiences to identify With a serial
kiqller Without feeling guilty about
it.

Since then there have been films
like “The bark Knight,” “No
Country for Old Men” and the
“Saw” series, where serial killers
are so dehumanized that there is
no real understanding of where
their evil comes from. Do you
think this is sort of harmful to
society’s View of Serial killers
because in reality their actions are
most likely driven by some deep
emotion issues?

The ﬁrst thing to say is that what
is really easy to forget to_ that
statisticallyls eaking serial murder
is an insigni icant crime. By which
I mean it never accounts for more
than one percent of the nation’s
homicide'rate in any given year.
And yet, it saturates our media.
The second thing is to say that even
in something like “Silence of the
Lambs,” you have this sutggestion
that there is almost some in
supernatural about Hannibal, e
is sutpematjurally intelligent, he
has ‘15 ability to escape from
seemingly impoSSible Situations. He
literally cannot be caught. So I think
ﬂiere’s almost been that tendency
to make ev11 ﬁgures somewhat
supernatural as a way to sort of
romanticize them, but also as a
way to distance them from normal
people. But the third part of this is
that what’s often unsatisfying to
ﬁeople about real serial killers is
oW much they resemble us. If you
take a case like the famous Son of
Sam murders that took place in the
New York in the 19705, before an
arrest in that case was made, you
have exam 1_es of media coverage
that made t is guy into some
su ematural monster. No one knew
W at he looked like. He seemed
to be able to do what he wanted at

will, he could never he caught. And
whenlDaVid Berkownz, who was
this kind of pudgy postal worker
from_Yonkers _was arrested, pen le’s
reaction was lLke, ‘Are you id ing
me? This is Son ofSam?’_”And they
were disappomted cause it didn’t
match wha they thought was going
to happen. So I think people were
on the one hand fascinatedby this
figure because they seem like us
but on the other hand they need to
turn them into something different
from us cause the thoug tthat we
might really be similar is just too
disturbing.

Where do you see violence in
culture going in the next 10 years?

First of all I think the culture is
saturated. i think it is saturated to
the point we don’t even recognize
it anymore. So I don’t really think
there is much more than can be
donealn teiins ofthe harm, I’m a
skeptic about that kind of thing.
EspeCially when it comes to
violence, I Just donft think there

is any sort of effective wa to
measuring What impact it as on
people and I don’t see how you can
isolate that effect from a_host of
other pQSSibilltleS. Here is a reall
interesting example. A numbeij 0
years ago the state of California
was lgoing to execute. their first
deal room risoner in a number
of years an the local PBS stations
sued the state of California for the
right to teleVise the execution and.
it went all the way to the California
supreme court. And interestingllly the
state argued not that they shou n’t

March 5, 2010

be allowed to broadcast because it
would be too horriﬁc but they said
it would set a dangerous precedent
and then more executions would be
teleVised and by the end the Would
just become banal. The pub ic _
would Just lose interest. And I think
that’s a really interesting thing to
think about, cause that is sort ofthe
next frontierilet’s broadcast actual
acts of Violence and let’s see how
people react to that.

And yet, in US. culture in the 19
th century hangings used to be
public and draw large crowds.

‘ Absolutely, 0 back even farther

than that to t e Puritan era, some of
the largest public gatherings in the
colonies were for executions. That’s
what brought the whole community
together and the preachers preached
at those times and made sure that
the crowds were getting the_right
messa e about w _ at was going

on an it’s really interesting to
think about why did that change?
When did executions start being
sort of hidden Way inside prisons?
When did they stop beinglpublic
spectacle? But you’re rig t. . .We’ve
kind of gotten away from that, and
I think} at’s a good thing. ButI
also think it sort of made it easier to
pretend that we’re not such a Violent
society in some ways because at
least when it was in public we

were sort of confronted With this
spectacle.

A powerful crime drama set on the streets of Jaffa’s Ajami neighborhoodia
melting pot of cultures and conﬂicting views among Jews, Muslims and
Christians—and told through the eyes of a cross-section of the city’s
inhabitants: a young Israeli ﬁghting a criminal vendetta against his family, a
Palestinian refugee working illegally to ﬁnance a life-saving surgery, a
Jewish police detective obsessed with ﬁnding his missing brother, and an
afﬂuent Palestinian dreaming of a future with his Jewish girlfriend. As their
stories intersect we witness a dramatic collision of different worlds and the
tragic consequences of enemies living as neighbors.
