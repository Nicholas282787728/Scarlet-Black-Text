Hybrid Media elucidates future artistic avenues

Futuristic piece amalgamates old forms of art with new media to create an usual spectacle for the viewer

When you enter the Faulconer Gallery, you find your
self immersed in the future ofart, an organic blend of trat
ditional artistic techniques paired with the limitless post
sibilities offered by technology. The show, open from April'
9, to June 6, is called Hybrid Media, and it showcases the
work of Matt Kluber, Art, and John F. Siinons,]r7 a cir—
Cull’bendlng artist.

Kitiber's work has appeared all around the world, from
the Museum of Contemporary Art Shanghai to the Ports
land Museum of Art. Equally at accomplished, Simons'
works have appeared at the Whitney Museum ofAinerican
Art’s Biennial and the University of Iowa's Museum ofArt.

Both artists are hard to label as they incorporate sev—
eral different mediums into their work. "Artists have always
been thrilled by new tools and it‘makes sense that someone
would integrate new media into old forms of art forms, like
paintings and sculpture," said Tilly Woodward, Curator of
Academic and Public Outreach for Faucolner Gallery.

on Monday, Kluher gave a lecture at 4:15 pin, in Faul-
coner explaining the unique process ofhis work. He begins
by making a minimalist painting, usually with several stirs
ring rectangles ofcolor. Then he chooses a video, whether
it is the work ofd German ﬁlmmaker like Lutz Mominartz
and his dancing girl or a video of Kluber’s daughters wad»
ing in a pool.

Klubcr then uses his custom software to project these
videos onto several pieces of aluminum, As a result, several
layers are conjoined with the original painting.to make one
creation.The digital projection runs for twos to threesmins
ute cycles and their fades away leaving only the color from
the paintinv until it slowly starts up againThis culminates
in a very intense, hybrid form of art that exemplifies how
far technology and innovation have come.

This unusual spectacle is the effect of light, created
by the combination of the two different mediums, “The
relationship between light is inspiring, the wav that the
light bounces back and it plays with the viewers eyes is
fantastic Woodward said

One piece that fully showcases this effect is the mes-
merizing No Place Like Utopia," with its pink black and
green eggs and its yellow and pink background, which
makes one feel like they are stepping inside Alices Wow
derland “Half Day Closing also has an unforgettable pats
tern ofdiffereut rectangles involving colors that make one
feel like jumping right inside the world of this enticing
work.

In his lecture, Klubcr discussed how amazed he is by
the way an artist now has the capability to project the same
video onto a scale as small as 4 by 7 inches and as large as
a 30 by 40 foot side ofa building. This versatility is some
thing he has used in his own work when ire projected the
video of his daughter wading in a swimming pool on the

Simons work also projects an amalgamated web ofrnes
diums and an uncanny sense of freedom. The explanation
for his work speaks to its trite innovation, “A monitor is
part ofthc surface ofiny pieces. but are viewed as a paint»
ing," Simons said. “The images in the software never repeat
so the pieces are endlessly unique."

One of his pieces, “Chip," has several creamtcolored
lines that bring the viewer's eye to the center where a fur
turistic display shows at its core a blue hall with crystals
protruding out ofit, Another piece that really catches one's
eye is “Crown," which is a combination of yellow blocks
concealing an entire world of red and white with various
images, and on the right and left a green computer window

even aluutui, '

The event begin with Rebecca Stuhi,
Collection Development and Plescrvm
tion Librarian, who reminded everyone of
Poem in Your Pocket day, which would ocs
cur the following day.

“Poem in Your Pocket is a national day
that has, until now, never been recognized
by the College," Stuhr silid.

Attendants were encouraged to take a
poem on their way out in celebration of the
approaching event.

The night consisted ofeight performers
who presented photography, poetry, spoken
word rind short fiction. Carolyn Jacobson,
English, read several works from her favor-
ite authors. Silvio Curtis '12 chose to read
a section from the Odyssey and Abraham
Kohrman ’13 presented a slideshow.

The show lasted an hour, closing with

inspired by William Carlos Williams.

Even if students were not able to make
it weducsday, they can look forward to
more open mic nights in spaces outside of
Bob's next scmester—cspccially when the
installations in Faulconer, like Hybrid Mes
dia, lend themselves particularly well to it.

"We try to do one or two every semes-
tcr," stulir said. “The library has a series of
events called ‘chncsday Nights at Burlr
ing,’ It’s still a ‘Wednesday Night at Burk
ing’ except this time,we did it at Faulconcr."

Simons is not really sure what to call his work, although
he refercnccs the work of Tom VVesselmann who made
paintings with TVs in the 60s as a source ofinspiration.

“This work could be called digital art, software art, hys
brid media, mixed media or assemblage and probably a lot
more," Siinons said.

Both Simons and Kluber seemed to agree that their
greatest hope is that through each oftheir works, the view»
er can feel a sense oflimitless freedom for the future of art.
“I think it's a really exciting time with all the possibilities
that technology allows for artists, and for me I feel like it
has allowed me to really find my niche," Kluber said.
