Men’s tennis looks to capture M

BY CiiitisTirtN CnMiNiTi .

As we enter into that weary, arduous
stretch just before final exams, we might ex-
pect the Grinnell men's tennis team to tone
down some ofits intensity.

This is, after all, a team that Won 78 ofits
81 conference matches. This is a team that
decisively defeated both Lawrence University
.lnd 5t. Norbert College despite the absence
of its top two players. This is a team that
organized Erotic Deception.

surely this pattern of perfectionism can't
be sustained, not in the dregs of spring se~
mestcr amidst looming tests and daydream
weather. Surely this team will soften, lose
some ofits precision, and relinquish some of
its focus. it has toitight‘

Wrong. Dead wrong. Any intimation of
late season faltering was put to test last Sat-
uiday when the team swept both Monmouth
College and Knox College to capture a 10th
consecutive Midwest Conference South Dr
vision title.The pair ofweekend victories also
marked the twentieth win for the team this
season.

“What I'm most happy about is the fact
that we were able to spread out play last
weekend and we played 11 players in the var
sity lineup," said Head Coach Andy Hanan
Alton, "We're trying to promote depth and
we're trying to create good experiences for all
our varsity players because, ultimately, some
ofthose players will need to step into regular
playing roles next year,"

Having graduated a number of impact
players in recent years, the Pioneers know all
too well about the necessity for a full bench of
able athletes. They can take some comfort in
the knowledge that of those 11 varsity piayr
crs who dominated the cottrts last weekend,
seven were underclassmen. Of those seven,
three were freshmen,

“I think we are deep," said urcaptain
Juan Carlos Perez ’1]. “We’ve been able to
develop some of the freshmen this year who
have taken spots in the lineup in singles and
doubles. our sophomores have also been do-
ing great. Obviously after freshman year you

learn a lot and they came out really strong
this year."

This Friday, the Pioneers will get an op
portuuity to test the extent of their depth as
the team travels to Wisconsin to participate
in the Midwest Conference Championships
(MWC). The Pioneers have won six cont
secutive MWC Championships and look to
continue the streak, despite their long list of
graduated players. “It's supposed to be much
harder to win this year," said co-captaiu Alec
Moore '11, “The pressure is on us because we
lost some ofour better players and we need to
show we deserve to win it," _

Undeterred by the pressure, concaptain
Sam Raife ‘10 remains confident that the
widespread talent oftlic team will fully Com-
peusare for any lost players.

“The conference tournament has always
been the highlight of every season, It's thiec
days of intense play and I think we have a
really good shot going into it this weekend.
Guys all the way through lineup are playing
well. freshmen have found their confidence
and we've played a lot ofniatches against a lot
oftough tcarns outside conference play which
has also prepared us well," Ratfe said.

For Raife, the team's only senior, the
upcoming weekend is especially incaningr
ful. Along with his ﬁlial Midwest Confer
ence Championship comes the opportunity
to win a fourth team championship, a fourth
Midwest Conference singles title and a third
doubles championship.

“I believe there have only been six or sevr
en other players in the history of the league
to [win four Singles titles]. And the league is
about 80 years old," Hamilton said. “In my
time as a coach at Griiineu, there's only been
one othenplayet who would have walked
away with 11 championships and that was
Nate Fox who graduated in 2009 and went
on to be an All-American at national (Olﬂnit’
merits.”

'Kramer dishes out some opinions on NFL draft

The NFL draft is the least exciting “event"in sports. Noth-
ing really happens. A few big guys around our age sit in a big
ballroom and wait to have their names called. It's like high
school graduation, but with 10 minutes of progiiostication
between the announcement ofvitledictorion and salututotian.
The drift is televised because many Americans will watch vlrr
tually anything about football, as evidenced by the success of
Craig T. Nelson’s Com/J. But the draft is not without its “161’
its, It’s an utterly optimistic event; every fan thinks his/her
team will improve through the draft, and it's hard to fault
their logic. Adding a talented young player should have
only positive repercussions. But in the highlyrmoner
tized world of professional football, top draft picks
demand exorbitant salaries based purely on perceived
potentialjaMarcus Russell. Ryan Leaf, Charles Rogr
ers. Courtney Brown, Joey Harrington, Robert Gal-
lery, David Carr, etc. have all proven that if teams
aren’t careful, they can waste millions of dollars and
countless hours of time developing a player who just
isn't talented or hardworking enough to make it in the _
League.

But a track record of exalting failures like the
schlubs listed above doesn't stop the sotcalled
experts from offering their opinion at every
possible stage of the draft, including literally
364 days before. Draft experts release their
asinine, make-believe mock drafts into the
internet to poison the sports fan’s reading en-
joyment ofboth the NFL and college seasons, like so many 3y,
ringes being dumped into a pit ofsytinges, a la Saw 11. Except
not as grossianybody who accuses football or hockey ofbeing
“violence porn" might first examine cinemas obsession with
torturous death. But anyway, draft commentators are wrong
as much as they’re right because they don't have access to the
resources of every teams from office and they don’t know any
team's exact plan. They don’t know if a team most values de-
fense or offense, what positions are considered the most press-
ing, if the coach wants the most NFLtready prospect or the

Kramer’s Rules

one with the most potential, or a myriad of other things that
affect a draft pick, but they keep trying, bless ‘em. All 32 franr
chiscs have a unique approach to the draft, and thus there is
no such thing as a “best available” prospect at any given point
in the draft. Nor is it yet possible to grade any team's draft and
say whether they succeeded or fiuledThat article can be writ
ten in like four years, when we actually know ifTiin chow
is the quarterback of the future for the Denver Broncos
or the youth leader of the future at some mcgih
church. I trust each team's front office to irtake
better decisions than a guy with hair like mine
or Mel Klpet’s, so I'm not going to denigrate
any team‘s selections based on my incredibly
limited knowledge. instead, here are, in my
opinion, the best and iiskiest moves of the
draft. '
Best:
Sam Bradford and Ndumakong Suh as the
top two picks
St. Louis and Detroit both did a nice job of
not overrhinking their positions atop the draft
board and took players who filled obvious
needs and who have gobs of talent ex»
hibited both in college ball and in
combine measurablcs. The Rams
filled their most glaring need, a
quarterback, by drafting Oklahoma's

    

Heismanrwinning signal caller, sam .

Bradford. Bradford is a smart pick notjusr because he has made
opposing defenses look silly (50 touchdowns, eight intercept
tions, and a 180.84 passer rating in zoos) and had a ﬂawless
pro day which alleviated any concerns about his injured throw»
ing shoulder. Bradford also showed in three seasons under the
microscope of a power program that he’s mature enough to
be a franchise quarterback. sam Bradford will spend his spare
time learning how to assault defenses, riot women, and that’s
going to give him a competitive edge over less mature rookt

ies and will rightfully make him a very marketable face of the
franchise.

Suh, unlike Bradford, is almost sure to be a success on the
field. He joins the Lions, a franchise that already has a mar-
ketable face in QB Matthew Stafford, so the weight of being
the team savior does not fall on his burly shoulders. Instead
ofworrying about the hopes ofa fan base on life support like
Bradford and Stafford, Suh will be able to focus all ofhis ens
ergy on preparing for his rookie season. I think suh will have
the most impact of any rookie this season, stepping into the
starting positron from day one oftrainmg camp and spending
so much time in the opposing backﬁeld they'll start to thinlt
he's a fullback Most scouts rate Suh as the most NFLtready
prospect in the diaft, and his potential to make an immediate
impact as a passrrushiug ET is clear from his stellar Senior
season in which he recorded 12 sacks. Now that the Lions'oft
fense is finally back on track, look for their defense to improve
markedly with the boy (OK, man) named siih.

Riskiestz
Denver Broncos draft Tim Tebow in the first round

Denver coach josh McDaniels may take home the Gob
Bluth Annual “I’ve Made a Huge Mistake" Award. Taking
Tebow with the 25th pick was a huge gamble for the Broncos.
Tebow is a proven winner and has exhibited truly once-ima-
generation leadership abilities. His Florida teams lived up to
quite considerable hype, but for once Tebow is in a different
position. Nobody expects anything from him after his thrown
ing motion has been picked apart and his ability to play quart
terback in the NFL has been not just questioned but openly
mocked (by esteemed drunk and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones,
no less). Making Tebow an NFL quarterback is a project, but
we know he will dedicate himself to learning as much as he
can and I feel that, in a few years, Tebow will supplant Kyle
Orton in Denver'only to be the same kind ofbarely competent
game managing quarterback that Orton is. Or hey, maybe by
that time he'll be head coach at the University of Florida and
Urban Meyer’s cardiologist will finally be able to relax.
