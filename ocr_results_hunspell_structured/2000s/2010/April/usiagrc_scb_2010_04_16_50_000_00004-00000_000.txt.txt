Dance marathon this weekend to

By KATHERINE ClluNc

Despite a week’s worth ofslccp deprivation, Griiiiicll stu-
dents will be dancing itnd grinding in Harris this weekend—
this time, for a good cause.

Grinncll College Dance Marathon will rake place tonight
in the Harris Center starting at 8 pm, lasting for 12 houis
until 8 a.m. the following morning. The event will culminate
the Dance Marathon steering Committee's year of fundraising
and community outreach for Project Kindle, a nonrptoﬂt orr
ganization that provides programs for those impacted by HIV/
AIDS as well as youth education about HIV/AIDS.

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a dis-
ease caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
that reduces the efﬁciency of the human immune system, In
2006, an estimated 11 million individuals in the United States
were living with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV/AIDS, aer
cording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
HIV transmission occurs when a mucous membrane or the
bloodstream is exposed to n bodily ﬂuid containing HIV, such
as blood, semen, vaginal ﬂuid and breast milk.

Camila BMHOSTCamaChO ’12, the leader of the Dance
marathon Steering Committee, came up with the idea for an
awareness-raising program about HIV/AIDS after Volunteer
ing at Camp Kindle, a therapeutic and recreational camp for
children impacted by HIV/AIDS, during the summer of2009.

“For me, it totally thawed my icy cold heart working at this
camp and meeting all these people who were so positively im»
piloted by an organization that wants to make it so that children
develop in a happy, healthy, strong waywarriosaCamacho said.

Erin Fitzgerald, the national director for the organization
SPEAK OUT- addressed the attendees at a talk in South For
turn on Thursday. SPEAK OUT, which stands for “Sharing
Personal Experiences and Knowledge: our UniqueTruths,"is
a program that works with youth speakers infected or affeetr
ed by HIV/AIDS designed to educate their peers. Fitzgerald
spoke about her experiences wirh Project Kindle, her personal
story and her hopes for the future of those infected or affected
by HIV/AIDS.

“I think the event on Thursday is almost necessary to really
appreciate the experience on Friday," barrios-Camacho said.
“Having the speaker come in and talk about her experience
with HIV and AIDS..,she really attaches a lot offeeling and
emotion to the story and I think they go hand in hand."

EarriOSrCamacho organized a steering committee of 12
students that came up with the yearlong project with the goal
ofencouraging more openness and understanding about HIV/

AIDS, a heavily stigmatized dis-r
case.

“People think that if you're
HIV positive and you're a wom-
nn, then you're promiscuous. If
you’re a man, then you’ie gay. or
you're a drug user ifyou're a min
or a woman," BarthSTCai‘naCl‘lO
said. “The notion of attaching
stigma to a disease is I think
something we all contribute to
in some way and it’s something
that has to be unlearned."

Winnie Mulumba ’12, a
member of Dance Marathon
Steering committee, explained
that she appreciated the idea of
a recreational event that also had

educational value.

“People don't feel comfort-
able talking about HIV/AIDS and they don’t really stop to
think aboutwhy that is,"Mulumba said. “I’m hoping that ev»
eryone can come together and really think critically about an
important issue facing our world today but also to have fun at
the same time."

The Dance Marathon Steering Committee modeled the
event after Dance Marathons at other institutions. Barrios-
Camacho looked to Northwestern University for example,
which raised over a million dollars last year for Project Kindle
during its Dance Marathon, hosted by Northwestetn’s Stu—
dent Government,

The Dance Marathon Steering Committee is already plane
ning ahead for next year’s Dance Marathon. Barrios-Camacho
said she hopes to be raise more money, have greater collaborar
tion with Student Government and hold a campus—wide elec—
tion to choose a beneficiary organization in the future.

Despite the Steering Committee members’ dedication to
this year's project, they experienced some bumps along the
road.

Barrios-Camacho explained that the Dance Marathon
Steering committee had difficulty fundraising, educating and
executing the project, partly due to the committee members’
inexperience with organizing a large event. The commitr
tee’s original plan of holding a panel discussion about HIV/
AIDS fell through due to scheduling complications.As of this
week, the committee has only been able to fundraise around

81.0007down from the initial goal of $10,000. BarriosrCar
macho believes that this is in part due to the number of other
fundraising efforts apparent on the campus this year—such as
for the Haiti earthquake and the Booth family—as well as the
economic recession.

However, BarriosrCamacho said that that this year, the
main focus of Dance Marathon is not raising money but about
spreading awareness of the event and gaining student support.

“More so than me money, I’m really hoping to see a lot of
student participation,"Barrios-Camacho said. “For me personr
ally, [if] at 7:30 a.m.1 saw that there were 100 people still [at
Harris], that would make the whole process worth it.”

Molly Miller ’13, another member of Dance Marathon
Steering Committee, advocated the Dance Marathon as a bet-
ter version of the weekly dances at Harris Center.

The Dance Marathon will have food, drinks, rafﬂe, prizes,
music and most importantly Red Bulls for 12 hours of merr
rymaking. .

1‘It’s like a 12-hour Harris where at the end of the night
where they turn on are lights, kick you out and make you go
home~that just doesn't happen," Miller said.

"I’m expecting a great experience," said Elliot Karl '12, who
plans to attend the Dance Marathon. “It's not often that you
have dance parties that have a purpose behind them,"

Interviews commence to find potential RLC candidates

No, those sort-ofyoungrlooking people in business casual more aware ofthe importance offinding RLCs who under

suits walking around campus are not prospies. They actually
have masters degrees and could be your quasirparents next
year—they are the newest RLC candidates.

The yearly search for new Resident Life
Coordinators (RLCs) has started and this
year Student Affairs plans to hire three new
coordinators as current RLCs, Katie Lau
and Eric Vos,leave at the end ofthis year.

Ideally, administration wants six per-
manenr RLCs for next year—one for each
cluster of residence halls on campusThis is
a change to the current RLC set up, which
consists of five RLCs. one of which also
runctions as the Lilly Intern. There are cur-
rently 10 candidates. all ofwhom are viable applicants, accord
ing to Andrea Conner, Assistant Dean and Director of RESIT
dence Life.

To ensure productive interviews, Conner followed suit to
previous years and enlisted the help ofstudent Staff and mem-
bers of the student body. To initiate student participation, she
sent out about two hundred e-mails to Student Staff, along
with anyone else who wanted to participate in the interview
process, indicating the dates and times candidates would be
interviewed.

Student Arrairs provided students with copies otsuggcsted
interview questions, candidate resumes, the RLC job descrip-
tion and evaluation forms so that they could effectively ques-
tion and assess candidates. Student Affairs gave Student Staff
members and nonrstaff members the same form at the end of
the process.

“It is the same blue form for all ‘evaluators,’ Conner said.
“The forms aren't the only response venue, though—we also
converse about it in person,"

RJ. Mahaffey '11, the senior Student Advisor in Clangrala,
took advantage of the opportunities open to students to meet
with the candidates,

stand and appreciate selfrgovemance.

“Some RLCs in the past overstepped their boundaries
in that they came off too strong and were more worried
about rules than creating a positive en-
vironment for students~an envuonment
that they would be comfortable in,"Mae
haffey said.

Lastweek he and a few other students
had lunch with two candidates who had
graduated from small, liberal arts schools
similar to Grinnell,

Mahatfey mentioned that when he
asked an applicant who graduated from
Kenyon College why they chose to apply
to Grinnell, they said it was because it seemed to be i good.
fun environment to work in,They were also intrigued by the
selfrgovernance aspect ofwhlch both candidates had a good
understanding.

Conner said that several of the candidates attended
"great undergraduate institutions with a commitment to the
liberal airs and strong graduate programs in Student Afr
faitsr"

“The group includes a signiﬁcant number of internar
tional people, people ofcolor and LGBTQfoiks,” Conner
said, She believes such candidates would be able to enhance
the diversity that the Grinnell campus publicly strives to
foster and achieve,

Speaking from her own RLC experience, Lau pointed
out that they are looking for candidates who would make
themselves available to students, are very attentive their sure
roundings and would work well with the existing staff.

During the interview process, Mahafiey has been on the
lookout for those with personable qualities and those who
realize Grinnell's unique environment,

"I like candidates that see the RLC position as a resource
and not something to be used as authority,"Mahaffey said.

With the departure of Katie Lau at the end of this SB,

mester, CND cluster resident Christian Snow '13 hopes that
the newly hired RLCs will still place their interests in interac-
tions with students.

"I want somebody who is approachable and seen around
campus interacting with students but at the same time is not
overbearing," Snow said. “I would like someone who can be
seen as confident that I could go to for advice about any situr
ation."

As the interview process winds down, the adln' 'stration
is using student and faculty input to narrow down their RLC
choices. The Grinnell community should continue to express
the qualities that they want in resident life coordinators while
they can. Student Afrairs plans to mail out letters to chosen
candidates by May 1,

Culver responded by saying a higher tax would hurt fame
ilies who can’t afford the extra cost.

“we have families struggling to pay their utility bill, to
pay their food bill and to pay their gas bill," Culver said. “It
can be a real deal-breaker for families who need to coin-
mute,"

Svendsen is pessimistic about the Culver campaign and
agrees with the current polling data. Culver currently trails
behind Brandstad by 16 points, according to a March 24 poll
by rassmussmreportsicam

“Based on ublic opinion, I doubt he'll actually be re-
elected," Svendgen said,

As the campaign season heats up, the Campus Demo-
crats will be more involved. According to Rennick, their
main goals are to set up satellite voting on campus, register
students to vote, canvas nearby areas and bring more candi—
dates to campus, much like previous years.
