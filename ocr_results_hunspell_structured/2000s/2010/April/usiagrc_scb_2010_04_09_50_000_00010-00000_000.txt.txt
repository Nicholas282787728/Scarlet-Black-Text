Golfers make
history with
tournament win

BY MARCUS EAGAN

At golftournaments throughout the country, the crowds
are most boisterous when a golfer manages to hit a great
shot despite how deep a ball is buried in grass or sand, or
obstacles lie or stand in the ball’s path to the green. Likes
wise, after one car and two players’ sets ofclllbs were stolen
while the team trained in Arizona for spring Break, the
Grinnell Men’s Golcharn is playing the best golf in the
team’s history.

“Neither Carlos [Lu ‘10] or Ethan [Kenvarg '12] used
that [theft] as an excuse, although they had every right to,"
said Team Captain Pete Kieselhach ’10.“Almost immedir
ately they rented clubs, went out there, played well and did
not complain about itTheir positivity in the face ofthar,l
think, rubbed off on the team,"

Both Kieselbach and Coach Brian Jaworski downplayed
the importance of the Arizona lnCldenL Instead, they ems
phasized going forward and they hope the team continues
its recent success.

"That Arizona Trip is so {arise tar behind us right
now because we have already played two matches," Jawor-
ski said. “We made school history in our last meet."

At the Des Moines Area Community College Invita-
tional on April 1, the team Won its ﬁrst title since 1973
and shot a 301, the lowest score in team history. Kieselbach
led the way and won the ﬁrst individual title of his career,
shooting an even par 72.

The win was especially impressive considering the in-
vite the day beforerhe Pioneers placed sixth In the Simp-
son Invitational, which was the first tournament the team
played since returning to Iowa from Spring Break. Klesel-
bath managed to shoot a team low 75, while other players
on the team struggled to score below so, finishing Wllh a
team score of322. The Pioneers’ recent success has been a
team effort, and Coach Jaworski will be the first to tell you.

“One of the things that is hard about coaching golf is
that there are very few times when everyone is happy with
their own performance, so this leaves the team fragment—
ed,"}aworsld said.“What I have been trying to do with this
team is to turn it into where we would be able to identify,
did we win the meet, or lose the meet—as a team?"

Coach Jaworski’s attempt to shift the individuals' come
petitive focuses to team wins and losses, rather than per-
sonal success, is unconventional because golf is tradition-
ally regarded as an individual sport.

“In a sport dominated by individual accomplishment,

this team has the attitude that individual scores definitely
mean something, but we are not satisﬁed with one or two
guys going low We have been there and done that," Jae
worski said. “Kieselbach, he’s been at the top of the confer
ence for the past three seasons—where has that gotten us?
Nowhere.”

In order to address the issue of individualism that
plagued the team in past seasons, the Pioneers have heen
stressing the importance ofteam camaraderie and cohesion

since the beginning ofthis season.The team mindset is eve
ident in the commitment each player has lnade to practice.

“I would attribute our success to our hard work in Ari-
zona and Grinnell, [where] we played a lot, we practiced a
lot, and we did things together as a team," Kieselbach said.
“We are physically and mentally prepared to play tourna»
merit golf."

And hard work never hurt anybody’s golf.
