Happy Valentine’s Day from Professoerim Arner

“The lyfso short, the craft so long to lernc,
The assay so hard, so sharp the conquerynge,
The dredful joye alwey that slit so yerne
Al this mene l by Love..."
Chaucer, Path/Imam .yFoto/t, 14

In honor of the spring I’m returning to a previously aban-
doned column about Valentine’s Day. It’s being published now
not only because 1 am lazy, but also because VrDay may have
originally been celebrated closer to this time ofyear rather than
on Feb. 14.

Everyone knows that Valentine's Day is a day to celebrate
love, but you probably didn't know that the inventor of Valen-
tine’s Day was my main man, Geoffrey Chaucer, who, by his
own account, me one ofthe most unlovingest and unloved men
ofhis age.

The tradition of honoring Saint Valentine dates back to
the 5th century AD, and it originally recognized two Christ
tian martyrs with that name who had supposedly been executed
on that day. None of the legendary accounts found in classical
or medieval hagiographies mentions anything about romantic
love, candy hearts or the Hallmark greeting card company.

It seems to have been Chaucer and his literary buddies,
namely John Gower and Sir John Clanvowe, who first wrote
poetry associating st. Valentine with love during the late 14th
century. These are unlikely founders of what has become a
holiday for celebrating romantic attachment and dedication.
Gower is most famous for a long Middle English poem called
the “Confessio Amantis" (“The Lover’s Confession") in which
a young man spends so much time trying to learn about love
that when he finally feels ready to enter into a relationship. be
is so old that he can no longer perform sexually. This work was
a big hit in its time—now it seems like it could be adapted as a
Cirilis commercial,

Chaucer's association with Valentine’s Day is no less
strange. In each of his major narrative poems, Chaucer presents
himself as a man forced to spend time with books because he
has been spurned by the God ofLove and, by extension, all the

What do

Dearly Beloved,
As some empirical scientists might report, the sun is shin-
ing, the birds and the bees are bumpin’ uglies and every last
bit of the 20 foot snow pile in the Kurn do Go parking lot has
effectively melted. spring is finally upon us, and Spring Break
is officially over. Now is the time to buckle down and earn our
keep. Instead ofbreaking out the towels, sun block and Buck
ettotMargarita, we‘ve got to start putting all of those second
mortgages, trustee scholarships and FAFSA bell grants to work,
For some that might mean putting in those extra secret
hours on Burling 5th trying to find the perfect 18th century
beauty product magazine advertisement for your History of
Nearly Irrelevant Obscuritics seminar, or for others it might
signal only a dozen or so more cram-
jam sessions left for trying to fashion
your blown glass Watson and Crick TIM H
doubleohelix replica into a functional
piece ofdrug paraphernalia. However,
for me it indicates something ofa dif
ferent sort. It marks the beginning of
the end of this whole college shaboom
shaboom, and the need to kick thesc Dream Living lntermgir
tions up a couple of DEFCON worry-wart points before the
Future makes its Blitzkteig.

So here's what I’ve been thinking of. With all this rising
pressure to camp out in GenComp and tough through our fi-
nals like an Oscar De la Hoya sparring partner, my concerns
have been growing increasingly more ‘meta'. What is it about
the taking-classcs-thing in general that has been good, bad,
ugly or useful? Are there any profound maxims that two learned
about learning over the course of my ..... learnmgt can I take
this printedtmedia opportunity to work through some concerns
that l have about the future of academics at Grinnell College
and about how to keep them out ofthe gutter? Ofcourse 1 can,
because this is my newspaper column and l have only so many
chances left to be so diatribically opinionated,

Here are some thoughts. A few weeks back, a professor
made a comment that struck my fancy. This talented scholar
(whom is luckily from my own department) brought it to the
attention of an alltcampus audience that professors, a lot like
students, are really actually just peopleipeople with respon~
sibiljtics, desires and reputations to uphold much like anyone
that you would more or less find anywhere.

Now, I will make a David Foster Wallace-sized caveat and
ask you to refrain from shooting ine—the messenger—for hav»
ing onlyjust yet simply stated nothing other than the obvious,
What continues to resonate With me from what this professor
said is how this similarity. this parallel in realities between 5m,
dents and professors, is a dynamic frequently effaced over the

single ladies, He doesn't do a good job marketing himself as a
potential lover, either, as he presents himselfin “The House of
Fame” and “The Canterbury Tales" as rather stout and some
what surly. He's less like Paul Bettany and more like SamWise
Gamgce,

Hi5 Valentine’s Day poem is “The Parliament of Fowls,"
in which Chaucer's narrator dreams
about how fine feathered friends
from all over England gather on
that day to choose their matesThe
Parliament is a loud, chaotic gathert
ing of young. lusty singles looking
to pair up for a brieftime. It's kind
of howl picture Harris parties but
with less booze, better poetry and slightly more bird poop.

Problems arise when three males allvie for the talon ofone
especially sexy female eagle in a 14th century version of “The
Dating Game."1n the end, the female asks for a year to decide
which suitor she will choose, and the rest ofthe birds are forced
to likewise delay their coupling until the situation is resolved,
thus forcing the male birds to depart with a serious case ofblue
bills.

Despite the lack of resolution and the bird's deferment of
desire, the poem ends with a song in praise ofsaint Valentine
and a celebration ofthe season: “Now welcome, somer, with thy
sonne softe/ That hast thes Winters wedres overshake/ And
driven away the longe nyghtes blake!" Certainly it seems that
valentine’s Day belongs more to April than to February

But what are we to make of a Valentine’s Day poem in
which nobody gets what they want, in which love is denied
rather than achieved? The answer, I think, is found in the pot
cm’s opening line, which hinges on the word "craft."

Chaucer’s poem reminds us that love and desire, knowledge
and power, will and virtue are all achieved through a process
that plays out over time. These things require learning, which
is not the immediate acquisition ofobvious truths but the dif
ficult development ofparticular skills that allow one to evaluate
facts, options and interpretations. And this is what makes this

 

course (no pun intended) ofour time hereTheory jargon aside,
whirl mean here is that there is a tendency on both sides ofthe

divide to disengage pedagogue and pupil from the very present .

realities that each of them share by virtue of their being real
people in the same place with similarly disparate needs. I think
there is very often a veil of ignorance placed over the fact that
students and teachers might have more to talk about than just
what's been highlighted on paper.

Here’s where I try to be consistent with the logic of my
project and more or less cover my ass by admitting ignorance
about the classes I’ve never taken and the students and profes-
sors whose experiences might prove wrenchtlike when thrown
into the systemic ﬂow of my
theory, Ok good. Now granting
efficacy to my sneaking suspit
cions and hunches, let’s ex-
amine an example ofwhat I'm
referring to. Say you're in such-
andtsuch class about so—and—so
topic with whosetatface up in
front as the teacher. You’re ast
signed this reading and that writing assignment to better your
engagement with the subject. Why? Well, it‘s on the syllabus
ofcourse, and that’s probably all you need to know. Maybe it's
canonical according to leaders ofthe field, or maybe its brand»
spanking new and meriting our analysis.

Any of these would be a perfect opportunity to dive into
the dark murk depths ofthe cracks in this relationship in a way
sympathetic to Professor X's aforementioned analysis. How
frequently do class and teacher ever discuss the point of their
assignments, the means ofproduction that go into inﬂuencing
course material, course assignments and even the overall struc—
ture ofthe experience? Who points their radar at the underlyt
ing conflicts and forces going to work in a classroom dynamic
to make it stuffy, awkward and dry or vibrant. provoking and
intense? And what is even tnore, why is it that students and
professors alike seem so patient with keeping up the “business
as usual" of making the classroom a place designated for the
production of only very specific kinds ofknowledges? I hope
I am not just conjuring up this skepticism, because it seems
rather apparent over here on my side ofthe court,

Maybe there isn't any desire to give classes this kind ofself-
conscious facelift, which I guess is ok, except that what I’m
ostensibly trying to do here is make a value judgment. I’d like
to be able to say that if classroom experiences were ones that
encouraged students and professors to make themselves psyr
chologically vulnerable to each other, they would also be more
open to the project of creating a self-aware journey qua learnt

poem so fitting to the spring as a reminder of what it is we're
doing here.

The second half of the spring semester typically involves a
mad dash toward the finish hne. As I speak with students about
final projects for my classes or about posttgraduution plans,
there is a palpable sense of urgency in reaching the end. Dill”

ing my time in the classroom, it
often feels like students are less
concerned with the immediate
questions of what’s happen-
ing during that particular class
meeting because they are thinkt
ing ahead to what is due for the
next class, what will appear on
the final exam, or what they hell they are going to do After
Gtinnell, all the while thinking “soon this will all be over."

it is important to remember, however, that pleasure exists in
the doing, not the having-done.

This is what the medieval founders of Valentine's Day unt
derstood, and their poetic selves happily sacrifice the satisfaction
of their own desires in order to guide us through the process of
thinking about our own. While spring brings the promise ofa
semester’s end and, for the seniors, the hope and dread of immi-
nent graduation, the focus on outcomes often blinds us to what
we’re coming out for in the first place, which is to learn rather
than to have learned.

Ofcourse, both in learning and in love, we require some sort
of recognition for our efforts, some sort of sign that our hard
work has or will have paid off. The reward may take the form
ofa long-awaited first kiss or an A for a particular class, but the
practice of one‘s craft in achieving these goals will continue to
pay offover time.

And so this column, having been longdelayed and craftily
written, is my Happy Belated Valentine's Day to you all. it's
been along time coming, and I hope it was worth it.

ing, which would ultimately be better for the whole sha—bang. 1
might not even be alone in this regard, which means maybe it's
only a lack of available tools and vocabulary that keeps students
and professors from going at the underpinnings ofwhatever it
is that structures our course dynamics.

Now, you might be thinking, “What kind of alternative sce
nario are you looking for here, Hederman? It sounds like you
want to take the rigorous academic work specific to each dis-
cipline and classroom and turn it into group~therapy"Tc this
I might respond, “Not just yet, brotdonculous." Here we are
in the heartland ofAmerica with ourselves, Daddy Warbucks,
Uncle Sam or even Roger Foger class of’69 footin’ the bill for
this not so ‘ljmitless' educational opportunity. but why pay such
a boatload of money to not even take the time to “talk about
talking" and “think about thinking” in classes where the chance
is readily available?

Sure your basic survey intro courses might need to pay re-
spectfully “holler back" at European style auditorium lectures
reminiscent of mandatory high school assemblies, but the rest
of the student faculty ratio ought to pull up its britches and
get its hands dirty. i think the unique opportunities offered in
a place as small and closctknit as Grinnell allow for the pos-
sibility for us to do more than just textual summary and re-
gurgitationWhy not also try to make transparent the baggage
that students and teachers bring with them to this supposedly
‘libetal' arts hullaballoo?

Obviously it’s an ongoing process that would probably re
quire a reevaluation of the aims of our whole educational ex-
perience at this college, but perhaps I’m not so opposed to such
a grandiose revolutionary proposal. Here is where I admit my
tendencies towards a halftbaked Marxism in my call for not
just a form of pseudo class-consciousness, but also a “course
consciousness"ofsorts—a consciousness where participants ent
gage in working through the troublesome material reality facing
their classroom environments.

Students and professors are all real people with real prob-
lems that they bring with them to the process ofbecoming bet—
ter educated. Perhaps ifwe can rc-lcam how to accommodate
the reality ofthese personal differences we might also learn how
to think differently. None of us are clean slates ready for infort
mational storage and retrieval, sponges for the soaking, putty
for the molding or any other caricaturetization posited by a
strictly positivist reduction.

There's more work to be done in the classroom than sim-
ply passing the torch of Knowledge from one generation to the
next. If we can start to take the time to give other aspects of this
ol‘ education the attention that they deserve, maybe then we’ll
be “living the dream."

Not satisﬁed? Deal with it.
