An unfortunate incarceration

I love talking about my “upcoming court date"
or “unfotninate Inmrceration" in public. There’s
nothing like being a social pariah and turning a
few heads to make life interesting.

of course. my “crime" consisted ofstanding
on a sidewalkwhrlc protesting drawer in Iraq over
break. My prison time lasted all of 13 hours. court
date pending. So I m not exactly a hard criminal.

The cops, surprisingly wcte unprepared, Imust

I must say thatI don't recommend jail, and not

later), and not being given my phone call Then

Surrounded by huge weaponry

In I999 about 20 of us crossed the line, tend
the words ofourcollectivc conscience to the pawns
in uniform, knelt down, hold hands. and said a
prayer before the gate ofthc 13an [in Des Moines].
From all sides wc were surrounded by huge weapr
onry. The guardsmen could have bombed us with
one of the same precision guided misslcs they had
been dropping (without UN permission, mind you)
on Iraq’s infrastructure for thc past 12 years.They
were softening them up for an easy war. like you
might thaw meat to make sure it cooks right. The
cops, from behind, were overly prepared to take
care of out dissent with steel handcufs and guns
that could have blown a hole through ourchesrs.

It's a good thing they direw Iis all In IaIl. It was
one cold night where yunkies and drunks piled up
in the cold concietcslabs ofihe holding cell around
us. No paper, pencils, not even socks. one toilet in
the middle 080 men. Yep, the streets were much
safer without us religious fanatics crying for aII end
to American aggression around the world that not

soil, It seems that now Ametieas worked Its way
into a predicament it may have a hard time getting
out of Good thing they looked us in a steel cage,
like you might with stray dogs at the pound. It was
a good way to encourage us that the United states.

row of police clad in riot gear stopped us. They
said we couldn't proceed further; that we couldn't

As an 1an who with his family members, relatives, and many of
his friends suffered torture, rape. prison, and exile at the hands ofthe
CIArinstalch regime ofsaddam's fascism since 1963, today as I hear
the news celebrating the U, s. victory over Iraqi regime, I feel the
saddest, obviously not because of the fall of the saddam Regime,
which I fought since I was I boyof 16 yeaIs old. I feel sad bchusc the

the top candidate for the position of the butcher of the region.

Ever hungry for poiver, Saddam was eager to prove for his Ametlr

stop the tide ofthc Iranian Revolution, provided Saddam with all
