"Are you a virgin?

It was the type of question we all
hope never to hear from a taxi driver.
Yet this was my situation speeding
down an 15*
tanbul high
way to my
grandparents
house late at
night. .“Ex—
cuse me?" I
replied in
disbelief.

Having grown up in lowa City, 1

At the request of students, ITS
recently reset the default on campus
printers so that all documents come
out doubledesided. This intent was to
change paper consumption and in my
case the effect has been quite notices
able.

Before, all my documents were sin-
gled sided. But now,1 typically: 1) print
out it nice, clean, doublesided copy
2) utter a word—of—one-syllable that
rhymes with “hit" and then 3) reprint
the document in the Singlessidcd format
1 lnvaliably prefer. So for me, resetting
the printers to duplex has inadvertently
caused two things to rise dramatically:
my paper consumption and my blood
pressure. Social scientists call this an
“unintended policy consequence.“

I know what you’re thinking: the
problem isn’t the policy the problcin is
Montgomery. True. I admit that the
duplex default probably don reduce pits
per use by virtually all printer operators
whose learning curve is less tint than
mine (Rhesus monkeys, for example),

But the real
point is, why am I
being asked to con-
serve paper in the
first place? You will
say, “To save trees,
you idiot!” As I un-
derstand it, the logic goes like this: trees
are killed to proVide paper, therefore us-
ing less paper means fewer trees being
killed. But] still don’t get it,

Qiitc a few chickens are killed to
make McNuggets, but McDonald’s has
not decimated the chicken population.
No one accuses Colonel Sanders of
driving Rhodc Island Reds to the brink
of extinction,

The more chickens we eat, the more
chickens there are — why doesn’t this
principle apply to paper and trees?
In actuality, it does. Companies like

question which he repeated are you a

consisted ofjumping out ofa speeding

I chose
the latter. I launched into an indignant

insatiable demand for paper could be
increasing the total number ofti-ccs, yet

But appaiently it isn‘t. The United

2000 the United States added about
388,000 hectares of forest per year
(wwwﬂmrig). Even in Europe, where
the English insist on wrapping fish and
chips in tabloid newspapers, forests ext
pauded by 888,000
hectares per year.

Most of the int
dusrrialized world
is being reforested,
not deforested. De»
cades of soaring
agricultural productivity have allowed
farmland to slip back into natural forest
even faster than it can bc gobbled up by
urban sprawl.

And now you’re thinking, “Hold on
there, Buckol Do you deny that de-
forestation is among the most critical
problems facing the environment?" I
certainly do not. From 1990 to 2000
South America lost more than 3.7 mil-
lion hectares of forest per year; Africa
lost over five million hectares per year.
These are really scary numbers.

Is this happening because those

I have a feeling
that this essay will
not persuade inany
Grinnellians to start tossing away prints

to sweatshopechic. (Call it a hunch.)
But I hope it will make Grinnellians
ask themselves some very important
and challenging questions — questions
such as “How can Montgomery tench
classes with his head stuck up his rear
end like that?"

I also hope that students who div
agree will feel free to write any critical
comments in the form of letters to the
editor. Most importantly,l hope those
letters will be printed on just one side
