Additionally, we are considering moving c1ucus- -i-elated ,

the caucus section. so that this section can be
a principal forum for student political debate.
There ale two cautionaiy notes that we
feel we should make:

teirogate candidates in trying to make a deci-
sion. But what role can the 588 play?

We're going to be running this special caur

cus section every two weeks. Our hope is for it
to be a four-page pullout section in the center
