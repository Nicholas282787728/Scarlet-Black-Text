1. History—see left.
2. Unity—It’s that time ofyear when the youngin’s are making new friends and new repw
rations, whilst the old folk are settling into their last year of Grinnellian disillusionment.
With one fell swig, tltc campus shot drowns all presence ofclass and maturity, so that we
are all but a throbbing smorgasbord oflO/lO greatness.

3. Progressioniwhile our inhibition and motor skills may be regressing, the progrev
sivc party style creares a migratory path for all those hipster»iwcazmysunglassessindoors
southies to infest the cold, barren land of north campus, while the northern dwellers
descend upon the undiscovered eesspools ofthe Deep southTherc is also some east side
and oriecampus business going on somewhere, but those parts are usually forgotten.

4, Random People~Along your travels you will undoubtedly meet new people with
whom you will share your life stories, aspirations and maybe even some bodily ﬂuids (The
salivary sort, you dirty pervert! Leave that for Halloween, you knaveE). In any case, you
will either forget meeting the majority of these people, or pass them thinking, “Now,l
know they want to start a pony farm in Estoniat . .r 1 just don’t know how.”

5. substance— The ofﬁcial sponsor ofall favorites 1 through 10.

6. Rescue Dogs—All the answers to sobriety's prayers conveniently available in a mobile,
happy-to-share, backpacktoting fellow Grinnellian. Whether you need a granola bar,
condom (see #4), or some more of”, these dogs have you covered.

7. The Number 10~However you chose to embrace the blessed number—ten shots of
151, bottles ofmad dog, or trips to McNally’s, all at 10:10am7incorporating the number
ten into your usual Saturday regime is a great way to get prepped for the coming festivi-
ties. (I don't endorse any of these, except maybe the trips to McNally’s- pick me up some
Malibu and pineapple juice pleasel)

s. GrassiNo, but really, the green spiky stuff that grows beneath our feet. 10/10 is the
perfect time to revel in its jolly greeness whether you trod, stumble, or pass out in its many
cool, caressing blades. Get it while you can, because before long it will he covered in un-
forgiving snow, which is not so kind to the weary traveler leaving a Fetish postparry in
sailor garb looking for a place to lay their little gob-capped head.

9. Recollecting—lo/ll, aka “oh shit 1 did What?!?” Nothing is more excitingly painful as
having your nights escapades recounted to you by a close friend, and doing the same for
them. Warning: This may result in avoidance oftlm d-halJ/other‘public spaces until at
least after fall break

onto our outdated 10/10 l-shirts and empty handles in fervid anticipation of the next
