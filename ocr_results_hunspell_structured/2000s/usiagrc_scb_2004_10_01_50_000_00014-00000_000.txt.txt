"Irwe put it together we can win at least three ofrhose matches."

Several orthe Pioneers will be playing through injuries. Janson
has a possibly torn rotator currrhat prevents her from serving. Be
cause of their packed schedule, the Pioneers have been unable to
practice in over a week,

As the team continues to work hard through this rigorous sear

predate the people who are making an effort to come to the high
school from the Grinnell community and from Grinnell College to
watch us play.”

“We played five intercol-
legiate contests in two
days. No other sport
even comes close to
that. It‘s physically very
demanding.
