With the 2003—2004 yearbook new expetted to he comr

Krohn, dean for strident life. "It’s students'irioney that students
are in control of."

SPARCs biggest responsibility is detelmlning the bud

One idea was to absoih SPARC into SGA, in which it
would function si‘milai-ly to other SGA Committees such as
Films and Concerts. “Over the past 10 yeais [SPARC] has be
come so independent that" students have not bet informed
about how the monevs being used in SPAM; said Cmdy in

delegate speeifie pages or photo asstgnments, but instead (is:
pended on staffmembets to do what they could based on their
own schedules. onte photographers hatl mken photos, there
was no functional system ofﬁling or retrieval for layout designr

In the spiing, layout designer Christena McIntyre 07 and
scvcnl ether yeaiho'eit staffers approaehed Jen Kroh'n, dean for
student life with concerns that the yearbook would not be fin—
lshcd. "At that point, we were just eoneemed that it didn't hnpr

Mclnryic said thit at the time she didnt know any-
thing about the Student Publicitions and Radio Committee
(SPARC) and assumed that Krohn, as a member of Student
Affine, was the best person to whom to address her eeneems.
Kmhn expressed a similar ignorance ot‘ SPARC‘s functioning.
“1 eoulan‘t even figure out how to get a hold of them quote,"
she said.

Jacob KaufniunrOsbom ‘04, SPARC business manager, as
well as SGATre-asuierjot the 20032004 schoolyenr, said that
he, too, heard concerns about the ) eathook’s progress from both
students and Student Affairs staff. KaufmanrOsbome spoke
with Hetz “every week or two,” he said. “Everytlme 1 talked to
him, he made it clear to me that theie was no cause for concern,
that they were on schedule,"said Kaufman-Osborn.

“Late second semester, it hit me at that point that it was too
late for patchwork,"said Herz, He assured Krohn that he would
finish the yearbook over the summer. Herz also communicated
with SGA Vice President Andy Grimm ‘05 over the summer,
who served as a liaison between Kmhu and Hen.

Herz worked on 40450 pages ouer the summer, he said, but
