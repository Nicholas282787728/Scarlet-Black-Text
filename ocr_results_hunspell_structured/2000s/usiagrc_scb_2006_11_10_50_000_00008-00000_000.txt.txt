Go" East,
Young Man!

BV PAT CALDWELL

“An insurance company." “A mental instltu
tion.”“A hospital.”“‘lhe corporate part ofcamprrs.”
“Too clean." “Sterile."

These are just a few otthe ways that students
have described East Campus The East Campus
dorms ﬁrst opened to students in the fall of2003,
marking this as the ﬁrst year that all four classes
have not known Grinnell wrthout the buildings.
originally the dorms were only know as ‘A’,‘B’,‘C’,
and ‘D'before gaining their current names. These
impersonal names (which are still sometimes used
by students) helped set the attitudes that earlier
classes had about East Campus and which still
have an eiteet on the student body.

Even as the ﬁnal East Campus dorm receives
its name Rathje Hall this week, stigmas and
concerns about community linger.

Early Stigmas

Beginning even before the dorms opened,
students began asking questions that would con-
tinue to plague the dorms years later. In an 5651:
article from April 2002, Sarah Aswell wondered
how East Campus would ﬁt into the North and
South Campus dichotomy, predicting “East Cam-
pusers will be described as ‘those who do not live
on North or South Campus. You know,just sort
oflike when you live on East Campus, instead of
anywhere else."’

Many studcnrsat the time were opposed to
the dorms even being built. During her prospre
stay the year before the dorms opened, Julie Ed-
wards ’07 said “I heard that it was representative
otcveryrhing goingwrongwith Grinnell college,
because students and alums didn't want it, but the
administration did it anyway."

Once the dorms opened with the arrival of the
class of’o7, the prevailing attitudes regarding East
Campus were negative. Edwards ,““tvhcn l
was a ﬁrst year, it was looked down upon to live
in Easti" Edwards explained this as the fact that
“it was seen as very disconnected," and “no one
knew how to handle it "

Avrain Cottschlicli '07, who has lived on both
North Mid South Campus but not East siid, “A
lot or people didn't think it ﬁt into the rest of
campus,"

Underclassmen

Members ofthe current ﬁrst and secondryear
classes olfer similar experiences to the current ups
perclassmen. Katie McMullerr ’09, who lived on
East Campus last year and is currently an SA in
Rose, said “I got a shuddering look when I said I
lived in East.”At the ﬁrst ﬂoor meeting McMul-
len recalled her SA snying,"1 didn’t want to live
on East, it was the last choice, but we'll deal," and
was told about the conceptions that East Campus
does not have community.

Emily Wax‘09, the current HSC, lived on the
same ﬂoor as McMullcn last year, and related how
at their ﬁrst ﬂoor meeting the stigmas against Ea t
campus became evident quickly,
Wax said, "it was clear from the
beginning that we are not supposed
to be a group that was close."

The class of2010 seems to have
inherited these attitudes. Dan
Ferguson '10. who lives in Hans
nihal KCl'Sl'iaW has noted that while
individual ﬂoors cultivate commur
nity, few people know anyone in the rest of their
building. He said that few events happen on East
Campus, and there is no sense oflatger commu-
nity “East doesn't really have a personality, except
that it's exceptionally clean," he said.

Architecture

Besides the complaints about the lack ofculr
ture and history on East Campus, architecture of
the buildings is also said to inhibit community
building. Unlike the brick buildings found on
North and South Campus, East Campus was built
using limestone, leadi trident complaints that
it did not ﬁt With the of the campus,

The most common complaint held against
East campus is that the room doors do not stay
open. Fire codes aﬁcctcd the construction of the
new buildings, necessitating doors that are heavier
and close automatically.

According to Tom Cntdy, Vicesrrtsident of
Student Services, the doors were sludcnts' top

hallways in the dorms are longer and wider than
other pai ts ofcampus. These factors contributed
to the stereotype that East Campus dorms do not
have a sense of community.

Changing Times

Now that the Grinnell student body has not
been at the school without East Campus, the
stigma: against it seem to be lessening. Many
members of the current senior class noted that
the tone or the prejudices was set by the students
who were hcrc before the dorms opened. Anne
Bernier ‘07. who has lived on East Campus all four
years, said “the people who were unhappy [about
E t] ve been graduating."

Edwards, who was
the HSC otEastcampus
last year, has also noticed
a change during heryears
on campus. Last year,
while working to add art—

Dan Ferguson ’10 work to the walls of the
dorms, she sent an email
recruiting residents and

emphasized the stigmas ofEast Campus. Many
ﬁrstsyears responding by asking “What stigma?"

For Edwards, this was a strong sign that the view

of East Campus has shifted and at this point, “it’s
pretty much gone."

Hemnnt Bhardwrrj ’07, who has Lived on

East campus three ofhis four years on
campus, agreed with these sentiments.
When discussing the stigma, he said
“it’s progressed over these four
ycal5"11nd that “over time [East
campus] will fully integrate

itself,"
