trafﬁcking, genocide

Pulitzer Prizerivinning journalist Nicholas “Nick" Krisrof has
used his position as a columnist for The New Yar/z Timll since 2001
to champion human rights around the world. He’s observed in

genocide in Dill'ful', Sudan, sex trafficking in East Asia and gang
rape in Pakistan. Kristofgave the Rosenfield Lecture Thursday as
part of a Rosenficld symposium on genocide. The $551? spoke to
KristofThutsday morning before his speech.

When did yau flirt hear adorn ll}: gman'd: in Darﬁtr?

I heard rumblings about it in early 2004, and then made a trip
there, partly to write about it. I was a little skeptical about what

I could find. Then I got there and I
was just blown away. There were tens
of thousands of refugees, and they
all had stories that were just hearts
wrenching. People were being killed
every day in the area that 1 was in.
I wasn't so much hearing about it as
bumping up into it.

The single most important thing he could do is to put it at the

it, if he were to call up other leaders, if he were [0 visit the region,
then that attention would result both in a decline in atmcitics in
Darfur and the first step towards solutions.

humanitarian eaort would be a good thing for
American image.

Actually providing security in Darfur will cost
money. It will have to be an international effort.l
don’t think we can send in Us. ground troops, but
we will have to pay for foreign ground troops.

Conservative Christians were very important at the beginning of

but not nearly as active as they could be. As to why President Bush
hasn’t responded most of all,1 think he’s afmid ofraising an issue

Absolutely, in a way that was not possible 10 years ago. Particu—

constituencies pushing for more action on sex trafﬁcking arc evane
gelical Christians, typically on the right, and feminists, traditionally
on the left. At a time where our country is so polarized, I think it
would be great to find areas of cooperation It‘s great to get ac»
tion against genocide, but it’s also great to get some action across
the political divide.

The most important thing students can do is to yell. No ponds
cian is in favor of genocide or sex trafﬁcking. It’s just a matter of
perceiving that constituents care about these issues, and then they
manage to show some interest as well.

I think in general it's good to have more companies ofall kinds,
including internet companies, active in China. I think those compat
nies, however, have been much too willing to kowtow to the Beijing

count so he can be arrested without any kind of legal obligation to
do so, strikes me as an utter betrayal of its responsibility.

In some ways, it’s comparable to slavery at its worst. There’s aﬂ
kinds ofscx trafﬁcking, and some of it involves girls or young woms
en who know what they’re getting into and choose it in some form,
maybe because their options aren't great, But there are also plenty of
girls who are enslaved in any meaningful sense, and for them, differ
ence with 19th century slavery is they end up dead ofAiDs by the

Security sees rise
in campus crime

av ABBY RAPOPDRT

When Ryan Kartheiser ’09 couldn’t ﬁnd his iPod,
he assumed he had misplaced it, until his neighbor
Wyatt Montague '08 also found his missing only
then did both realize they had been robbed,

Since the beginning of the semester there have
been eight different incidents of theft, ranging from
a laptop to a rice cooker. According to Security Su-
pcrvisor Amy Coleman, much ofthe crimc was due to
careless security Many crime victims, like Kartheiser,
left their door unlocked when gone.

Security is working with the Grinnell Police De-
partment to create a list of possible suspects. Accord-
ing to Coleman, the authorities will look for patterns
that may lead them to the culprits This happened
two years ago, when Security caught two thieves in—
side a student's room.

Coleman attributed many ofthc thefts to a feeling
of trust on campus. “it’s generally a friendly campus,
so people let their guard down sometimes," she said.

But more troubling to Coleman are the incidents
in which the thiefpricd offwindow screens and forc—
ibly entered the room, as well as the sheer number of
incidents. In several cases, the students burglarized
had locked their doors, but it did them little good.
“And I can‘t think of a time we've had eight [thefts] in
one month,"she said.

These were not the ﬁrst incidents of premeditated
crime. Miriam Stanton ’05 had her laptop stolen dur-
ing the last week of classes last year. She had left her
laptop in the top ofBucksbaum, turned out the lights
and hidden it in the corner of the room. She was gone
less than 20 minutes, but when she came back, the
computer was gone, a sign that someone must have
waited for her to leave the room.

Stanton said security should be more willing to
send out crime bulletins. “They were really hesitant
about sending an allcampus c—mail," she said.

According to Coleman, security notifies the cam-
pus whenever there’s a need for heightened security.
Because eight crimes in less than a month was over
whelming, security has sent out multiple bulletins to
students.

Kartheiser agreed that notiﬁcation is important,
“I didn’t think there was [any crime} That’s why I
didn't lock my door," he said.

For Stanton, the crime also affected how her
friends thought about security. “Once my friends
knew about it, they started taking their laptop everyt
where," she said.

Stanton, who lived off campus last year, found an
easier way to secure her computer: locking it down.
“It would be pretty easy to get the community locks,"
she said.

Coleman said students would be even safer from
crimes ifthcy always locked their doors. "[Students]
should lock their doors and be secure, whenever they
leave their rooms,” she said.

But this is of little help [0 Karrheiscr, who will
not buy a new iPod. “I don't want it stolen again,”
he said.
