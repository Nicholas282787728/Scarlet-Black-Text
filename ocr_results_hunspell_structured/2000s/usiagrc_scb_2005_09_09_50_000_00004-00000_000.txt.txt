Bv REBECCA TAYLOR AND ALISHA SAVILLE

Mads Ljungdahl found a destroyed football table.
He salvaged a set ofplayers and began to photograph.
Ljungdahl, fascinated by the metal bar that forced the
players to move in unison, set up a series of altcrcd
images, Five players loom together on the wall, their
eyes and mouths blackened to present the idea of un-
willing, gory entrapment

Ljungdahl is one of thirryanine Danish photograr
phers whose work is on display in the exhibit “Scan—
dinavian Art 2: Denmark" in Bucksbaum Center for
the Arts. on September 2, several photographers visa
itcd the Faulconcr Gallery to share their perspectives
on Denmark‘s infant photography market in a panel
discussion.

The panel agreed that in Denmark, interest in
photography as an art form is low. "When 1 was inr
retested in photography nobody in Denmark was in-
terested in photography,”Tovc Kurtzwell, who began
her photography career in 1967, said. The lack ofemr
brace causes her ro feel as though she is “halfrliv-ing
and half— dying in a way."

The panelists explained that thc commonly held
sentiment in Denmark is that anyone can take a phOr
tograph, which explains the lack ofreverence for it as
an art form.

“[Th: Danish] take photos of themselves but they
wouldn’t think of hanging a photo of someone else
in their home as an an object," Lars Schwander said,
insisting this will not change in the near future.

“It will take years oreducation before people hang
up photographs because rhcy like the work," he said.

Charlotte C. HaslundrChristcnscn also explained
that photography does not rank high on the Danes’
list of priorities, “Denmark is provincial. If they got
money they will buy land," shc said.

Most artists expressed frustration with the can,
temporary Danish reception of photography and in-

' sistcd that Copenhagen is twcnt'y years behind other

major cities. Thc panelists described the scarcity of
galleries and poinrcd out that rhc art schools lack
photography departments.

As a result, nearly all of the panelisrs supplement
their income with other jobs. Sorcn Losc teaches at
a secondary school “in order to maintain a proper
standrup."

Adam Jcppesen lives and works in London, where
he is able to support himselfin the film industry. He
said that by keeping his photography separate from
commercial ventures, he avoids compromising his

By holding additional jobs, photographers can also
avoid rhe process welfare system. Though the welfare
system ensures that artists will not starve, Lose dcr
scribed it as being “very stressful."

Ljungdahl believes it has a narrowing effect on
what sort ofwork is deemed useful by society “1 don't
receive social security, but if I want to receive anything
from the state I have to work for the state for a very
low salary and it is wrong for human beings," he said.
“Ifthere is nothing else, then good, I’m glad we have
it. But it would be so much better for society if people
were allowed to do art when they received it,"

The govern- ment has been minimally sup-
partly: of photographers in recent years. The young
photographers hope to live on grants but the govern
menr recently cut back support. And although the
government is offering tax write- -offs' in order to en-
courage businesses to buy photography, the businesses
prcrcr “safer purchases" such as valuable paintings,

"Extreme democracy sounds good from the one
side” Schwandcr said. “But that in order to do well,
you must be close to those who give the money. The
problem is that the money goes to painters and sculpr
tors,"h: said.
