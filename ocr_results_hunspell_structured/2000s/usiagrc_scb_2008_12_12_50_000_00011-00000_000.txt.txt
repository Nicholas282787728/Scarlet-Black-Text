Final call to sketchiness from a not-so-sketchy alum

When I began writing this column, I didn’t realize
how many lives I would touch. And now, after all of
the widespread adoration I‘ve received, the love letters
from firsttyears, the phone calls from the New York
Times, my one obligation. if anything. should be to
continue producing a quality piece.

Unformnately, it's that time ofyearﬁxam time.
And. ofcoutsc, this translates to the demise ofsketchy.
Suddcnly, in .1 span ofabout a week, this college has
transformcd~lt3 disproportionately more normal
now. Students walk around the JRC with an eager
look, their persona focused. Burling is packed 244,
and weekends are relatively quiet.

I’m constantly on the lookout for sketchy, rare as
it may be these days. If you feel as in need ofsuch a
divergence as I do,you might pay attention to the fol»
lowing details. Hopefully, after this anecdote, you too
will learn how to manufacture your own, homemade
sketchiness.

A few days before Thanksgiving, I ran into my
good friend Dan LaFonntaine at the Grille. Intel-
ligent and friendly with a perpetual smile plastered
across his face, Dan exemplifies Midwestern Nice.
Dan also happens to be a very good tennis player. We
spoke fotjust a few minutes, exchanging general con‘r
merits about exams and the end of the semester.

As I left the Grille,1 humped into u grorrp ofune
derclasswomen, whom I'd never met before. Gaping
in unison, they stared blankly at me, What ensued

went something like this:

RANDOM FIRST YEAR #1: Oh My God,was
that Dan Lafountaine?!

HARSHA: Umrn, yes

RANDOM FIRST YEAR #2 (emphatic): That
was Dan Lafountainc?

RANDOM FIRST YEAR #3: He is gorgeous!

RANDOM FIRST YEAR #2: Seriously, I read
he's like ranked 40th in the county in tennis

RANDOM FIRST YEAR#3: Did you know he
dated Maria Sherapova?

RANDOM FIRST YEAR #1 (skeptical): No
wa

yRANDOM FIRST YEAR #3: Way! It was like

two years age. They dated for like three weeks. They
met at some advanced tennis camp in
Europe

RANDOM FIRST YEAR #1 (to
HARSHA): You know him?!

HARSHA: Yes, we’re friends

RANDOM FIRST YEAR #1:
Okay. has he, like, ever, like, said any
thing about mt? Because I swear we totally made eye
contact rn ARH once. And rhea it happened again in
the PEC like four days later.

HARSHA: Umm,I really don't.

RANDOM FIRST YEAR #3 (impassioned):
He's so hot. Oh my God, Dan Lafountaine is like the
sexiest thing to hold a tennis racket since Connors

won Wimbledon in ’82.
RANDOM FIRST YEAR #2: Actually, I think
he’s more Borg. He’s got the same smooth blonde
hair”.
RANDOM FIRST YEAR in (with a surreal in
tensity): on. MY. GOD.

Some of you may doubt the true sketchiness of
this circumstance, but imagine yourself being ran
domly approached and having to field such bizarre
pronouncements. It makes me proud, in fact, that you
Giinnellians have learned to embrace this sketchis
ness.

on that note, I'd like to say that I've immensely
enjoyed our bi-weekly meetings. We'll be taking a
five-week respite. Until
then, as at certiﬁed col-
lege graduate, I urge you
to live up to your poten-
tial, fellow Grinnellians.

Harsha Sekar 1m
mm Be sketchy; don‘t hide
from it. but embrace it

with pride. You have helped facilitate, often trmes
more graciously then I could have ever hoped for,
some ofrhe sltetchiest, screwiest sets ofcrrcutnstances
rathornable. Flvt: weeks away shouldn't impede your
innate eccentricity

Grinnell,1 love you. You're this columnist's dream
come true. Thank you tor a terrific semester,

 

Bears do things so right in the wintertime

I think the reason that some people don't like
wrnter is they aren't as unspeakably lazy as I am. The
minor mobility inconveniences caused by four feet of
snow buy you three months worth of laying around
in fuzzy slippers drinking warm beverages and eat
ing Cookicsiprctty freakin' awesome

The only thing better than sitting on your butt
absorbing calotrcs in wombelike comfort is sleepe
ing for unlimited amounts of timoExper-imentul
research has shown that I am capable of passing out
for over 12 hours at once. And once you've wasted
half the day, you might as well accept that the rest
of it isn’t going anywhere productive. Why get out
of bed.>

This trail ofthought has led rm: to be envious of
bears. They get real fat and sleep for months straight
in the winter. Cheers, bears. You have life figured out.
And, astoundingly, it gets even better.

In between meals, I play softball This requires
a certain amount of muscle mass, which undoubt-
edly would be turned to jelly as I relaxed in my den,
since for every day of inactivity you lose about 1—1.5
percent ofyour muscle mass, plateauing at a net loss
of 6045 percent ofyour original strength. I'm not
exactly a monster in the gym to begin with, so I’d
have to wake up every couple of diys to do stprats,
which sounds like a terriﬁc nuisance.

Fortunately, those bears have thought of it all.
They invented an inhibitor ofn-iuscle degradation, so
come springtime, Papa Bear is still in shape enough
to hunt boy scouts by the dozen.

Experiments have shown that growing rat mus

rat's muscles from breaking down after a period of
inactivity, This suggests that something in the bears
plasma keeps the rat's protein brcaketedowners from
eating the muscle when its cells get hungry.

Since bears don't eat or drink (or pee) for three
months and keep their body at in almost normal
temperature, their bodies ought to be under serious
metabolic distress—which isjust the time most mus~
cle breaker—downers jump into action. But in bears
they don’t, iind it woiks out fine.The beat just runs

This is pretty clear evidence that God likes bears

One ofthe first signs ofAIDS rs a loss of apples

Scientists strll aren't exactly sure what goes wrong,
but research shows that your body rs preferentially
burning muscle instead of far So it would be great
if a little hear plasma could eliminate the muscle as
a potential encrg , source and force your body to use
far.

It would also he a sweet deal for astronauts, for
