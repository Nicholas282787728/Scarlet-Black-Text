who plays mums and runs indoor and oiirdoor rrsek.

The forum was in essence divided into two parts: Are Grinnell
sporrs suefcring from a surplus ofathletes? And whar, if anyrhing.
can be done to thin rem size?

Too big?

“l don’t think there is a singular answer to the question ‘Do Grin-
nell teams have too many athletes?m said Stanislaw. “The answer de-
pends on personal morivarion and pasr experienceves, Gtinnell roams
are growing, rhe limirarions ofrhe faciliries are being resred and per.
sonalired arrcnrion may be surfering. Bur, rhc friendships, opporru.
niries and beneﬁis ofa large body of parriciparion may be more im-
porrant.”

Even srarisiicnily, derermining whcrher numbers are rising is dih
ficulr. cerrain reams in her have few players rhan rhcy used ro.
Even two years ago women’s basketball lacked numbers to run a full
court S»on»5 scrimmage in rraining camp. During rhe John Pfirsch
era, men's soccer would field as many as 60 players. “1 think it de-
pendson rhe year, really," said Athletic Diiccror Dee Fairdrild. i would
say maybe overall. we may have more [now rhan we used rel,”

in general. rhough, several reams, such as swimming, cross coun-
rry, volleyball and soccer, have seen sharp rises in reeenr years, which
leads back ro rhc original quesrion: can a ream ger roo big?

“Do we cur people from teams? No, we don'r do diar," said
Fairchild. “\Which makes it hard on the coaches. makes it hard on the
bettereskilled players, because especially more players who are nor as
skilled, sorne ofrhem feel rhey have a righr ro equal rime and equal
pairiciparion, and res yusr not possible."

”You should be able to come
to school here and become a
better athlete While you’re
becoming a better student.
The two should not be mutu—
ally exclusive."

Some have snggesred rhar rhe players or rhc rop suhfer when
coaches musr devore oerra time toward giving basic skills rraining ro
newcomers or fuserimers.

“When we had players rhai came in . and i think rhis is ride for
orher sporrs a rhar had never played the sporr before, we spenr pies
season urne working on basic skills," volleyball player carhy Srella
‘04 recalled.

“The [lack of ni cur po 'underlnines comperirive arhleries,"
saldsoocer player Dana Fri 5. “Practices have io be made easier
ror rhc srhlercs wirh rhe least skills. ir creares a division in ihe ream
because ihe gap in skill level is larger [Andl rherc are nor enough
coaches. if Grinnell wanrs ro conrinue rhis ridiculous policy. they
should have the iespeer for comperirivc athletes ro hiic enough

is insane.“

“in my expellenzc. when rhc talent
specrium is fairly narrow, rhe numbers
event such a debilirsnng Factor," said
women's soccer coach Henrlrcr Benning.
“However. in years where ilreic is n lor or
variabiliry beiween your number one
player and your number zoeromeihing,
rhe numbers begin ro make ream rrnining
moie difficuli. From a player’s peispecrive,

The forum generally came re a similar oonclusion bur rhe ma.
jority ofurrendees voiced rheir supporr for the expansion otorher
arhieue nlrernaiives or less comperirive organiearions ro siphon the
less skilled conringcnr away rrom the varsiry reams so rhey could be
srrcamlined and more efficienr.

“The rhing abour varsiry is rhar varsity
is for the best-skilled people, and we have
inlramumls and we have club spores, we
have activities," said Fairchild, echoing rhe
senrirnenrs of many. "You shouldn't go our
for rhc swim ream ifyou don’r know how
ro swim, ifyou don‘r have wellskilled tech»
niques However, you can improve on rhose
techniques rhrough classes, and rhen who
knows, ihen go our for rhe ream lateri You
have four years, I guess."

“Srudenrs who rhink this is rude or
mean ro cur kids are simply revealing they
have never played ar a coinpcririve level," said Price. “1 have dedi-
cnred my life ro my sporrs and have riied ro play as a coinperirivc
level since I was seven," she eonrinued. “Non-competitive aihleres
have nor. They should simply have a ream rhar berrer suirs rheir
social priorirics.”

To cut or not to cut

Three solurions were proposed ar the forum: implemcnring a
cur policy, hiring more ml? or expanding inrramural, junior varsity
and Club teams. Grinnell College does not have an official cut policy,
though the Grinnell handbook details that coaches may limit team
size on the basis of “dcmonstmted skills" and “evidence of Commit»
merir ro rhe sporr and ro excellence." Teams will also ofren employ
“navel cuts," or rake only a limired number ofparrieipanis ro road
games. Still, with only a handful of reams acrually following chcsc
guidelines, some arhleres feel rhar a more forthright and diioer our
policy is necessary.

”People say kids come here for rhe no-cut policy," said Price.
“Grinnell is ranked well, ir is a good school. Kids will come here no
merrei whar. Changing ihe norcut policy will arrraci iusr as many
people as ii will derer. You should be able to come as school here and
become a berrer arhlcrc while you’re becoming a better srudenr. The
rwo should nor be rnurually exclusive."

However, rhe prospeer ofimplemcnring a srraighr our policy and
ending Grinncll's riadirion ofopcn pairieiparion has many coaches
and nrhlercs leery,

“Ifa cur policy is insrared righr now, I rhink u would he very bad

improving and providing public knowledge abour orher sporring
onilers, such as inrei in umls, inrramurals, P15 classes and communiry
spores groups “ltiat are nor no hard core as rhe varsiey spons

Many of rho coaches aie reluctant as well.

“I can't say I am a big tan of the idea of curring," said i-lurley,
“but somcrhing inighr have to give "

rives ro vanity."

Labowitz, for one, expressed supporr for junior vnrsiry reams,
but noted that they are difficult to maintain over the long term. “I
don't think rhere's a way ro ensure rhai we can ger enough people ro
rnainrain iv reams," she said.

“We have, in rhe pasr, had some iv games," snid Fairchild. “I

Nor would a junior varsiry ream solve

“We could have iv. bur our limirarion righr now is pool spare. Phase
II of rho Athletic compch will hopefully address this.”

Still. rhe prospeeis of expanding or crearing alrcinarive arlileric
ourlers for Grinnellians gave arhleies across rhe spcerrum of the de-
bare somerhing ro agree on

“There was a lor of good inpur [ac rhe forum] in eirher purring
