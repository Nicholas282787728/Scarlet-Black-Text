A favorite Mexican restaurant of Grinnell
college's student body, La Cabana, plans to
open its doors in downtown Grinnell in the up-
coming weeks.

The process has been underway throughout
the summcr—the proprietor Willy Almazan
believes that die popularity of the Newton and
Marshalltown restaurants will carry on in his
Grinnell branch.

“It’s a very nice town with a big college," said
Almazan. “We have so many customers [in the
Newton restaurant] who are from Grinncll,we
have so many friends here."

According to Almazan, La cabana was
originally expected to open during the month of
July 2009. However, Almazan has experienced
difﬁculties in transforming the building, previ-
ously occupied by the Gtinnell Coffee Com-
pany, into a restaurant.

“It's easy when you’re opening where there
was a restaurant before because it has a bunch
of stuff done already," said Almazan. “But here
there’s much more stuff to do, like making the

kitchen."

Despite these challenges,Almazan said that ,

the restaurant will definitely open its doors by
October, but hopefully by the end of the month,

Grinnell College students who have already
experienced the culinary wonders ofLa cabana
cannot wait for this popular restaurant to open.

“The food is just really good, it's kind of '

home-style," said Alysia Vallns '10, a longtime
customer of the Newton La Cabana. “Their
salsa and chips are great, and they have great
vegetarian options."

Almazan says that the restaurant will be
similar to the Newton restaurant, with a larger
space capable of scaling up to 99 customers,
room enough to accommodate large parties.

“So many Grinnell students do big parties
on the weekend at La Cabana," said Almazan.
“For birthday parties, I can give free birthday
shots iryou're over 21."

For Vallas, La Cabana was always a tram
ditional spot to uniquely celebrate someone’s
birthday

“If you go there for your birthday, it’s a

Vallas. “They put on a sombrero and they sing
to them, and in the meantime all of the staff
comes out and starts whapping them with their
order pads,"

The Grinnell Chamber of Commerce is also
excited for the business to open in downtown
Grinndl. Angela Harrington, the Grinncll
Chamber President, said that La Cabana will

be a key piece ofdining culture which will con
tribute to the sustainability of downtown.

“One of the things that you see in [the]
regentriﬁcation districts is that there is a shift
towards more at a mix of dining and rcrail,
whereas in the old days it used to be primarily
retail," said Harrington.

The aforementioned shift toward dining
culture is evident in the opening of another

The sight of children playing on brightly
colored playground equipment situated across
the street from the Alumni Recitation Hall may
seem incongruous, but the Grinnell College
Preschool Laboratory is a unique asset ro the
school. Recently, the preschool has implemented
heightened record keeping policies as part ofits
curriculum in order to better serve attendees and
their fan-lines.

The school was founded in 1963 with a grant
from the National Science Foundation and has
since operated as both a childcare facility for the
community and a psychological laboratory for
the college

Lead teacher Karen Veerhuseanangerud
and assistant teacher Connie Molison staff the
preschool ninetime, with help from three to four

Grinnell College student-teachers at any given
time.The preschool runs as any other childcare
facility might, allocating time for art projects,
snacks and individual work

"Any child from the area can attend. Karen
and Connie run the school, doing everything
from lesson plans to administrative Work, and
students {rpm the college work there tor smaller
shifts to help with teaching certain activities and
supervision," Nora colter ’10, who has been a
student-teacher for two years, said.

In 2001, the preschool began using parts of
the creative curriculum, a multi—faceted structure
based on the theory and research of prominent
child psychologists and federally recommended
for priwite preschools such as the Grinnell Lab.

Last year, Vcethusen-Langerud and Molison
focused on establishing a childrfriendly environs

operate independently and learn to be selterelie

the child-sized tables and chairs and easy—access
toy bins.

This year, the focus is on assessment and
documentation, the ﬁnal aspect of the creative
curriculum. Instructors are now required to take
notes and photographs recording children's ace
rions, language, gestures, facial expressions and
creations. According to VeerhuteneLangerud,
the children either do not appear to notice the
extra documentation or appear to enjoy it. “They
like to pose for pictures,” she said, but added that
instructors try to take candid photographs.

In addition to documenting skill develop»

The shift in focus corresponds to pending
