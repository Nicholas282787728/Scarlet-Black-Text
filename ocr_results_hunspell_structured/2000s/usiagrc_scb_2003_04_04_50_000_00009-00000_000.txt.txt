In the spirit of springtime

As the excllcment or incipient springtime begins to
bubble within us one question has entered everybody's
mind: will we always have spring, or Will the futur: some.
how alter out seasonal cycle? To this 1 can reply with cone
ridence: have no rear, more will always be spring, and spring
will never change. There will always be chotiues oreitubeta
ant birds to hail the dawning orthe sun (and then vomit
into their new offspring’s mouths). There will always be
ephemeral gusts or love, resulting in elaborate and awke
ward courtship tituals. There will always be an exaggtte
ated, ridiculous disgust with pale skin and tan lines, hairy
legs and winter ﬂab—which will always lead to a select
group orindividuals somehow turning themselves orange
The seasonal cycle will change slightly, however, as there
will be no mote winters in the nature except for apooilyp.

No, Richard, robots will never have emotions—how
date you mention such a thing. God. in His inﬁnite wisa
dom, has given emotions exclusively to human beings with
the otphcii intention that they be used in only two ways:
worship and reproduction. 1 tan guarantee, therefore, that
no robot will ever be angry at you for withholding sex. You
will need to find other disciplinary measures to control

oated glances and cold silences to make them imagine they’ve
done something horribly wrong—almough ofeoutse they
have not. since robots never do anything wrong: they just
do what they’re told. If there's one way to manipulate a
robot, that is to challenge its conﬂdcnie in its own pro—
gramming, thereby scrambling lLS sense of purpose and

Anger management advice

days of mulling things over might reveal that your ini-

we're all better sewed by people who try to deal with
their grievances in a cool. rational manner, than by
those who fly off the handle ata moment’s notice, un-

problems within the student body first. Unless someone’s

recommend meditation over recri mi nation (and admin-

Oscar predictions a disappointment

- FORSHAME!!! Farthe pastthreeyears, Torn Robson
’02 and I have supplied you with good (read: funny,
articulate. informative, and above all else accurate)
Oscar prediction articles and ’fWho Will be Crying at
the Oscars" is the drively’ou ﬁnd to succeed us? Not
only were their predictions wildly inaccurate (0/7),
but the critics had no conception of their subject
matter! In many cases may picked the LEAST likely
nominee to win (Daldry for Best Director?) as their
top choice, or worse—used wishful thinking (Moore
for Best Actress).

Nevermind mat they entirely left out the oh so
necessary mocking of the nominees! Once again, for
shame!

Suggestions for awakening students

I have two schedulingrecommendations for the

' college. ﬁrst. the college should add 10 minutes to

50-minute classes making them an hour. This would
allow discussions and lectures to hit a stride and it
would allow more time for student presentations, es-
pecially toward the end of the semester when classes
inevitably experience crunches. Secondly, the ooLlege
should start classes at 9 am. not B a.m. Substantial
scientiﬁc evidence demonstrates that college students
do not learn as well and are, as a whole, less alert and
interésted early in the morning. We could bump the '
last class of the day to the’ﬁve o'clock hour or later——
some colleges have classes that meet well into the
night. Later classes would alleviate stress induced by
sleep deprivation and it would make class lime more
vigorous and vibrant. How about some awakening
changes around here?
