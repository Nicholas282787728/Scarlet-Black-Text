Working
towards a
green campus

A new administrator and an old
committee work to improve the college‘s

environmental policies

by Brian Clites
Staff Writer

This year Gi-innell College took a step towards rurrlrerrng the
college‘s environmental awareness by creating the positron orEnvia
tonmcntal Coordinator in Facilities Management.

Brian Turner ’02 was lrircd into the temporary position to re»
search and advise the college on its environmental decisions. Turner
plans to move on next year, but he and the Fcocampus committee
(also responsible for oFﬁcially advising the college) hopes that the
new position will be made permanent and expanded upon.

WhileTurncr is on the payroll to advise rheeollege, the Ecocampus
Committee is not paid or funded. Although it just formed its mis-
sion statement, the committee is not new. Ecceampus star-ted when,
in 19%, a group arraculsy members joined our ormutual concern
when the old Darby Gymnasium ﬂoor was taken out and dumped
instead orbeing reused.

The committee evolved and President Osgood made it oFﬁclal
and returned it the Campus Advisory Committee on Environmen-
tal Concern. Both Turner and the Fcocampus Committee are re.
searehing and advising the college on ‘green' building, wind power,
and other issues.

Turner’s pos

Turner began his involvement in Grinncll
environmental awareness two years ago through
involvement in bodr Free the Planet and Envk
ronmensal Action Group his first year. His inr
volvcmens varied each sueeessive year, and his
interests took a turn towards agriculture when
he smelled in India hrs jtlnlor year.

During his ﬁnal year as a student, Turner
became increasingly involved in sht planirrng
or the student garden (now located across from
Younker), which would ultimately lead him
back to Grinnell. Just before his graduation, he
and other students in EAG submitted a pro.
posal to the college for the creation ora perma-
nent position to oversee she student garden.

By the end or the summer Turner missed
Grinnell, and returned to campus. He walked
into the President's ofﬁce and said, “can i start building this garden?
Because I really want to see it done." President Osgood said that the
college was interested in hiring someone who could research and
advise the school on environmennsl issuesThat conversation sparked
she eventual formation ofthe Turner’s posisiorr in FM. He really
hopes she position can be continued.

The student garden is located rust oucidc orYounker Hall, and
has evolved this year from its formation to the addition ofstudent
sculptures and the curreirt construction ora strztwsbamed toolrsl‘ied.
In addition to overseeing the garden, Turner has also been charged
with the responsibilisiu ofimprovrng campus recycling programs,‘
and accessing the reasibrlrty oreompossing, ‘gteen’ buildingarrd wind
energy.

Recycling

Turner thinks that Grinnells recycling program is very good, but
highlighted contamination as the biggest problem in the current sys-
tem. Contaminatron rs whcn recyclable materials get prrs into the

he dining halls are
doing a tremendous job—
they’re probably recycling
virtually 100 percent
students, on the other
hand, probably only
recycle 25 percent."

wrong bins or mixed up.

Currently, the recycling bins are emptied by the hall ,anitors, and
then collected by FM grounds membcr Greg
van Tomne, who takes it all to the redemp.
tion center where it is sorted into the mtcgoA

magazines, clear glm, green glass, brown glass,
and plastic. “Ifahin is too contaminated, Greg
throws it out, and i don’t blamehim...its too
time consuming and incihcient for him to go
through all orit,” saidTurner.

"The best thing we can do is an onslaught
of cdumtlon. For the students who want to
recycle. they should be able to do is while least
impinging on the lianitors and FM] people
who have to pick it all up,"Trrrner said, “I'm
really happy Grinnell has made recycling in.
stitutional; many schools have cut their recy—
cling progmms.,,Thcreisagood opportunity
to market [Grinnell] as a green institution,"
he added.

Whilestudent participation is low, the dining halls setting a good
example. “The dining halls are doing a tremendous jobitl‘ley’re
probably recycling virtually loo percent students, on the other
hand, probably only recycle 25 percent," Turner said. White paper is
also a large problem.

White paper has a much higher monetary return for recycling
than colored paper. but in the past students have been unable to
recycle white paper without too much contaminating it too mueh.

Composting

Both Turner and the Ecocampus committee are pushing the
possibility orcommercial composting for the new campus center.
A composting system would decrease waste output and increase inc
put emciency by composting the sons of food that the dining halls
currently dispose eras solid waste through their garbage disposals.

with a composting system, instead or being thrown away or
dumped rnso the sewage system, food would be decomposed, and
thus recycled within the Grinncll community, To help decompose

the nitrogen-rich food waste, dead leaves, yard clippings and other
carbon sourers could be added to the compost.

The compost could ilien be used for campus maintenance, local
gardens and other applications.

‘Green’ buildings

The concept of minimizing waste output is at the heart or the
Ecommpus committee. "One or our goals is so make Grinneu
‘greener‘ by lowering inputs and outputs,” said chair Vince Eckhart.
ln addition to researching composting options for the Campus Cert»
rer, Ecocampus is also pursuing handing opportunities, such as out»
side grants, to dertay the cost or purchasing a commercial system.

Turner and Ecorampus are both emerally charged with research»
mg and communrcasing with building communities, and the masr
sive campus center is a large focus for both or them. We're hoping
that, through the [Ecocampus] committee, the designs ofthe Clm»
pus center and Noyce science center phase ll are much ‘greener'
than they would be otherwise," said Ecklnrt. “We [also] want to
make it easier for the students to learn about these things, and to
some extent for the community to learn from our examples.”

The criteria being suggested by Turner and Ecocsmpus to the
building committees considers the new LEED (leadership in En-
ergy and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating System.
which assigns points for environmentally conscious elements ora
building.

The LEED criteria are useful because they consider more than
lust narrowcrwironmental stewardshipgincluding less commonly cons
sidercd environmental elements ofdesign like natural ventilation and
natural lighting. Depending on the number orpoints a buildingquzli»
ﬁes for, it can achieve basic. silver. or gold LEED certiﬁcation

“I think we should raise the bar as much as we can. ..I think I’m
raponsible (or putting us there as (at as we can go,” said Turner,
commenting on the level ofCampus Center LEED certification he
is pushing for. Although environmental consciousness and econom-
ies are not usually conceptualized together. Turner noted that green
building saves money in the long run by maximizing energy use. “I
think that Grinnell can mtch a wave orhuge change in the [building]
industry,” he said, "(Green building] is just smart,"

Swartz and Francis defend ITS computer lab plan

Computer labs, cont. from p. 1

added expense to the alreadygreat cost ofattcnd-
ing Grinnell.

Francis responded that the total number or
college-owned computers has actually increased
in recent years, with the creation or a lab in
Eurllng Library and a number of specialized
machines in departmental facilities, He also
noted that, between college» and student—owned
computers, there are now more computers than
students on campus.

students could afford to forfeit some conva—
nience in order to use those computers, he said,

but the collegeshould focus on making personal
computers more attractive rather than continu—
mg to fund public labs. “The question is," he
said, “can we get to a point where we ean pro.
vide the support where the students who have
computers will feel comfortable using them?"
And as for expense. Francis said. lTs had pro»
posed a system ofﬁnancinl aid for computer pur.
chases when it had drafted a proposal to require
laptops for all incoming studenc. When students
seemed to oppose that plan, ITS discarded it.
Furthermore, Francis argued, student com.
puter groups have a long tradition of resisting
changes. in 1990, he recalled, the student Asa.

demre Computing Committee (SACC) and the
user Consuls-ans corpsishe two groups that
have led opposition to the current ITS plani
had vehemently opposed the computer labs'
move irom VAX terminals to mid PCs and
Macintoshes, saying the old platrorm fostered a
unique community among computer users.
Francis also suggested that initiatives like last
month's, or the petition that drew 914 student
signatures for a similar proposal at the end or
last semester, may be driven by a core or dedi.
cased activists, while most students will follow
their lead without caring deeply about the issue.
Lass month's initiative was sponsored by

sncc, astudensgroup that aims to lmprovestu»
dentactess to technology. and by SGA president
Alejandro oyarcabal ’oa'rhough visiting sncc
members and many senators argued against the
US plans, oyarzabal, chairing the meeting, did
not voice an opinion.

swarsz and Francis, ror their part, seemed
firm in their dedication to the current plan.

"The number ‘1000 studentowned campus»
ers' sticks in my head," Francis said, "and its re.
ally vcty convincing.”
