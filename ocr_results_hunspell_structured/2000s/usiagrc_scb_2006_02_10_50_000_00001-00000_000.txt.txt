Under the warm glow of the South
Lounge lights, Ezra Mendelsohn
kicked off the most recent Rosenﬁeld
symposium Tuesday evening. Sofrc
spoken and barely audible without a
microphone, his demeanor contrasted
strongly with the disturbing nature of
his topic.

This week the Rosenﬁeld Program
held a weeklong symposium on the

. subject of gcuocide. Prominent speak-
ers on the subject such as Mcndclsoliu,
a professor from the Hebrew Univere
sity, and Chivy soit, a survivor of the
Khmer Rouge genocide, gave various
perspectives on genocide prevention,
The highlight of the event was a coir
vocation Thursday morning from Pu-
litzer Prize winner and T11: New Yer/s
Timer ' columnist
Nicholas Kristot'. It
was a concentrated
effort to bring more
attention to a prob-
lem that organizers
felt has been often
ignored

Mendelsohn’s
presentation fo-
cused on placing
genocide in a historical context, bee
ginning with the situation of the Jews
before the Holocaust. He offeied an
account of the “divided community" in
Europe and how the “sense of vulucre
ability was the unifying force after the
Holocaust."

On Wednesday afternoon, Gregory
Stanton, the president of Genocide
Watch, spoke on the eight stages of
genocide and ways to prevent genocide

, —President Gregonr Stanton,

in each orthe stages. speaking after his
presentation, he further explained the
causes of genocide.

“[Gcnocide] is a policy to increase
[political leader’s] power,” he said.
“They used it as a political tool to stay
in power or increase their power.”

According to Stanton, the issue of
genocide is particularly urgent. Right
now his organieariou is closely monie
tortng the situation in Darfur. Aer
cording to reports by the World Food
Program, the United Nations and the
Coalition for International Justice, 3.5
million people are now hungry, 2.5 mile
lion have been displaced due to violence
and 400,000 people have died in Dar»
fur. The U.N. has declined to label it a
genocide, citing the lack of genocidal
intent by (hi: Sudanese government.

"No govcrnmcnt
has the right to
commit mass mur-
der against its own
people," Stanton
said. “Human rights
are not given by the
government."

Later that day,
in her presentation
about the Khmer
Rouge Killing Fields, Sok gave a hu-
man face to genocide with an account
other experience in Cambodia.

“I spent about four years on the
Khmer Rouge killing field in a child In-
bor camp," she said, “Being stripped of

ably the most horrifying experience of
my life. From the time you woke up to

Ramiro Carrillo '07 works for the pan: of Dining
Services that most students never sec,

While most Dining Services employees are work
ing at Qiad, Cowles or the Forum, Cairillo heads to
Grinnell House at 1011 Park St. There he serves up
carered meals to guests of the college or tor special
events. Next year catering is moving, with the rest
orDining services, to the Joe Rosenﬁeld ’25 Campus
Center, This is supposcd to improve the services Ca-
tering offers, but the future ofthc space
it currently occupies in Grinncll
House is uncertain.

The new kitchen, located on
the second ﬂoor of the
Campus Center, is over
1,000 square feet in
area and includes a ser-
vice elevator. Several
private dining rooms
are located across the
hall from the carer
ing kitchen. Other
rooms, including the
Quaddnspired Din—
ing Pavilion, can be used for private events.

According to Catering Chef Scott Turlcy, the
Grinnell House kitchen is only about the size of an
average home’s kitchen—not large enough to meet
current demand. “We’ve outgrown it," he said.

Not only will rhe new kitchen produce more food,
but it will ilso produce more types offood. \ou wont
always have to saute a chicken," Turlcy siid, noting
that the appliances in Grinncll House limit his cooks
ing methods to suuteing, baking and roasting.

Cirillo is excited, tool “[For the first time, catering
is] going to be able to have several parties it the same
time,” he said

Like Carrillo, Turley believes the
new kirchcn will give catering new

ing currently relies on orders
from the Rosenﬁeld sympo-
sium, the President’s Ofﬁce and
various reunions, Turley
believes other campus
groups may take advane

tage of the services

This is good news for servers like Carrillo. One of
the highest paying jobs, campus catering hours can be
inconsistent from week to week. Each week, Judith
Barrett ’07 sends out a list ofserving opportunities to
a list of approximately 50 students. Times are given

riilo. Dining Services Director Dick Williams and
Turlcy are both optimistic that the campus center
might allow for more jobs, although they cannot be
suic.

Barrett is more cautious. “There’s no guarantee
that there’ll be a rise in student works or events,”
she said.

Williams and Turley see the
move as entirely positive. “As {or

and Williams will be involved in a future meeting that

will decide the fate ofGrinncll House. Williams be-

lieves the Grinnell House’s function will most likely

remain the same, although the administrative respone

sibiliry will shirt from Dining services to another or
flee.

Barrett hopes Williams is right, Along with her
job as a server, Barrett also works for dining services
by living in Grinnell House, where she checks eoe
ple in at the front desk, “We'd lose something fifit
stopped being a guest house]," she said. But she will
have to wait several weeks to find out the future of the
houseiand her job in it.
