Campus bikes are wonderful

HowI love the campus bikes! 1 zip hither and thither
across campus on these orange beauties whenever I
get the chance. But here’s where it gets tricky: only
ﬁve have been introduced! Of course our friends at SGA
are doing their best, but concerns of cost and security
still hold them back, Comrades, can we let this stand? I
say, spray every bike orange, let the paths of Grinnell
be awash with gaily painted bicycles, and we can be
one glorious, socialist cycling whole! To each accord-
ing to his cycling needl And bikes are only the begin-
ning—we could have Campus squirrels and cars! Throw
off your chains and embrace communal ownership in
all its forms! Or else, you know, tell your Senator you
think the bikes are great, and look out for ways to help,
I believe theyre accepting donations.

——Marl< Gardiner ’05

But where are they?

Just what is the deal with the gaudyvorange-bikes?
Ithink they're a great idea, forifyou are running late
for class, or for when you feel like a drunken Harris—
gntrbon‘ngaandrhot Late-night race across Mac Field,
or whatever. But why Can't I ever find a bike when I
need one? Last weekI had to plaCtically run to Burling
at 4:50 to catch someone before he left at 5:00, I ran
out of Cowles, notebook in hand thinking, "no prob
lem, I'lljust use a gaudy»orange-bike.” Welt could I
ﬁnd a gaudyaorangeabike? No, of course not, Thanks
a lot gaudyaorangerbikeagods. No really, thanks.
Thanks for allowing me to look and feel extremely
cool running towards Burling in Bordegree heat. Much
thanks for mocking me by placing a gaudy-orange-
bike directly outside of Burling 20 minutes later, when
I left looking and smelling absolutely delightful in-
deed.

Flush the damn toilet

As faras I am concerned, ﬂushing the toilet is an
extremely simple process. One must simply extend
either the right or left hand, and push down on that
shiny silver handle. Unfortunately, the young men on
James 3rd have failed to ﬁgure this out. Every week
at least one of our two toilets has been clogged. If
you are incapable of ﬂushing the toilet 1am sure
some sort of support group exists on campus to help
you cope with this deﬁciency. If you can't ﬁnd the
time in your day to perform this simple motor func-
tiun, speak to your academic adviser about time man-
agement skills. If you are clogging it on purpose,
please go back to kindergarten, and mailyour second
semester tuition to us to repay Facilities Manage-
ment for the visit: you have caused.

Just ﬂush the damn toilet correctly.

. Thanks,
206 Mona/ran '05
