Braving the corn for a dream

Russian native who wanted to return to Grinnell for school got her wish

“It's been like a dream,"
Katya Pekarskaya said about
her journey to Grlnucll and her
experiences here. Although she
was born rind raised in Rusr
sin, and is planning to attend
graduate school in England,
Pekarskaya has lived a distinctly
American dream.

Pekarskaya‘s story begins in
Volgograd (formerly known as
Stalingrad), Russia, l-lcr roots
run deep thereiboth of her
parents were also raised there.
“I didn't really get a chance to
know any other place," Poke
arskaya said. When she was
young. she was able to travel to
Ukraine and Belarus. “Besides
that," she said, “the first time I
was abroad was in the US. in
2000.”

In 2000, Pekar-skaya was ac
eepted to a yearlong exchange
program that placed her at
Grinnell. At the time, she was
studying foreign languages at a
local university. From her fore
ergn language classes and per
sonal research at guidebooks,
Pekarskaya was able to gather
at least a “superficial under
standing" of America. When
she looked at a map and located
Grinncll, she had her “:5me
tions about coming, “I knew
Grinnell was a good school,"
she said,“but the location made
me nervous.”

Apparently, the stereotypi-
cal image of Iowa extends well
outside the United States Pek-
rrrskaya said that even in Rus-
sia. “When you think of Iowa,
you think atcotn.” Shortly after
arriving in Grinnell in the fall
of 2000, Peltarskaya’s worries
about attending school in town
had disappeared; from the pc0t
ple to the academics, she loved
almost everything about the
college.

She made a number of
great friends from the outset
at International Student Ont
entation and although she later
branched out to make friends
with American students, Pekart
skaya felt a unique connection
to fellow international students.

skaya to stay in Russia for at least
two years She studied hard and
kept dreaming about returning
to Iowa cornfields and in 2003
was accepted as a fulletime stu-
dent at Grinnell. She wa lated,
but knew that hei matriculation
hinged on tinancial ind.

which was well short of what
she- needed, Not willing to give
up, Pckarskaya went to Gi'iut

help, Erin. in turn,wrote a letter
to an alumnus asking for potCl‘r

alumnus wrote back and gene
erously offered to pay whatever
was necessary for Pekarskaya to
come back
to Grinnell.

Looking
back. she
finds it hard
to believe
the course otevents that brought
her back to Giinncll. “I don't
know if it was lucle destiny, or
both," she said,
She is thanks
ml to everyone
involved, but
especially Brin.
“Deborah Brin

Katya Pekargkaya is the reason 1

am here today,"

she said, In
Erin's lrne of work. Pekarskayn’s
miracle couldn’t have had moi:
perfect timrng~everything
transpired durrng the week or
Passover contemplating that
fact. Katya, a Jew herself, said
“it was iust such a coincidence."
Not pleased with the connota-
tions of her statement, she par-
trally amends it. “Maybe not a
coincidence," she said, “Who
knows?"

Although Pekarslotya had
completed rout years of col-
lege in Russia, she recerved only
one year of credit from Grin-
nell. That year ofcredit plus her

year at Grinnell gave her ju-
nior status. Pekarskaya seemed
barely fazed that so few credits
had transferred, opting to put a
positive spin on things."]ustone
more year at Grinnell wouldnt
have been enough for me," she
said,

Pekarskaya described her last
two years as “very intense." As
an exchange student, she vowed
to become an Economics major,
Keeping her promise has re‘
quired overloading her schedule
with Economics classes. Cour
plecl with the stress or academt
ics has been pekarskayas dense
work schedule. Each semester
she has worked tour jobs, bale
ancing time between the Forum
Front Desk. the Burlrng Gallery
the Faculty House and the PEC
cage. To keep things intereste
ing, every semester she rotates
out the Forrrm Front Desk job
with a job at the Forum Grill.

Busy with school and work,
Pekarskaya generally doesn't
find the time to go out. She
does. however, enjoy living in
Russian House where she can
cook large meals and watch
movies with friends when she
needs to relax. Thanks to Galet
na Aksemova's class on Russian
Films, Pekarskaya has recently
become addicted to watchrng
old Soviet movies “The mow
ies give me a nostalgia feeling, a
piece ofhome," she said.

Pekarskaya will be tholk
sands of miles closer to home
next fall. Even with her rigor
ous academic schedule and foul
jobs, she has kept her grades
high, so high, in fact. that she
was able to gain acceptance to
the prestigious London school
of Economics (LSE). Next year
she will enroll in an intensive
12tm0nth program in Eco-
norrric History at LSE. “The
system will be so different." she
said. “It's another challenge I've
found for myself.”

If history is airy guide, luck,
destiny or a little ofboth will be
at work when Katya works hard
to overcome this challenge next
fall.
