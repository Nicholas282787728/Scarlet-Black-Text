Of the six students spoken to, all expressed

On-campus enrollment hits new high

By DAVID ARCHER
This semester's onacampus enrollment rcachcd a rccotd
1414 students due to an unexpectedly largc incoming class and
a higher than usual rctcntion ratc, according to collcgc admin-
istrators. And although administrators
say the college's facilities, faculty and

ncll Colicgc in favor ofhigherrranked compctitois, thcsc more
qualiﬁed applicants acccptcd four years in the corn hclds.
Administrators say tltcy'rc pleased with the quantity of thc
new students because ofrheir qualifications, but it required they
add two new tutorial professors to ensure
that no tutoiial surpassed 14 students.

staff are now prepared to accommOr
datc thc largcr student body, in early
August they found themselves scram-

“I don’t think people should
be alarmed by this. it shows
a very healthy admissions

“We looked for faculty mcmhcrs who
might hc able to add courses,"Vice Presir
dcnt rot Acadcmic Attairs, Jim Swartz

bling to add two new tutorial prorcs»
sets and adjust this semester's original
housing plans.

This year’s 450 new students or
ceeded the admission department's
original estimate by roughly 40 be
cause their models predicted the yicld (thc pcrccntagc of ads
mittcd students who decide to enroll) would decline when in
fact it incrcascd by onc percent.

According to Dean ofAdmission Jim Sumncr's model, five
factors indicated that the yield would dcclinc. Applicants dem»
onstrated better grades, bcttcr board scores, lived further from
the collcgc, applicd to morc schools, and came tram wealthier
t‘arnilics than applicants in rcccnt ycars. But rhc hchavior of
high-school seniors ptovcd morc unpredictable than Sumner
had anticipated, and rather than spurning admission to Grins

process."

Vice President of Student Life

said. “In the end Religious Studies and
Art had courses with low enrollments-J
think 2 [students] cacliﬁwliich could be
cancclcd. Faculty mcmhcrs from those
dcpartmcnts agrccd to much addcd tuto-
rials."

Swartz said the college did not expect the increased enroll»
mum to atrcct coursc ottcrings or professor availability over thc
next four years because while tutorials have stringent enrolls
tncnt rcquircmcats, most othcr classcs do not.

Morcovcr. Swarta said thc college has addcd “quite a numr
hcr offaculty members in rcccnt years," making it easicr to ac
commodatc more students on campus.“From prclirninary data,
the average class size this semester is identical to that of last
fall," Swarm said.

"1 don't think pcoplc should tic alarmcd by this," said Vice

iTom Crady

President of Student Life Torn Crady He said ”It shows a very
healthy admissions process,"rcfcrring in particular to the steady
incrcasc in applications from 2450 five years ago to thc 3733
who competed to enter the class of 2008.

Last year Newiwetk magazine labeled Gtinnell Collcgc the
“best concgc in Amcrica," hut Cmdy downplaycd thc rolc of
press in Grinncll’s admissions bounce. He said Grinnell Colt
lcgc has rcccivcd publicity from scvcral national publications
likcd thc LarAagt/tr Touts and the Allarm'r M0111My,and more
signiﬁcantly, hc attributed thc largcr and morc qualiﬁed applia
cant pool to the success of Sumncr’s efforts in recruiting more
qualiﬁed students.

crady said thc coilcgc avoidcd prc»East campus ovcr—
crowding in the dorms by allowing “a few more"upperclassmen
to 1ch off campus than had been originally givcn pcrrnission
to live off campus for the 200472005 school year. “In terms of
rcsidcncc halls, we can more than manage,"Tom crady said.

Crady speculated that recent changes to residence halls may
also explain why thc rctcntion ratc increased, Thc collcgc has
yct to study formally why rnorc studcnts returned this ycar,lsut
Crady credited the addition of East Campus, which “decomr
prcsscs“ the campus by allowing thc conversion offolmer quads
into triplcs. Hc also citcd morc cfrcctwc and rcsponsivc studcnt
scrviccs, cspccialiy last year's addition of on-campils mcntal
