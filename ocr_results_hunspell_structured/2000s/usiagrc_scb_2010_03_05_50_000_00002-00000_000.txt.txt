Hunt hopes that this open act ofrav
ism will start discussions about other-
wise unmentioned, but not unnoticed, problems.

“There are students here who can’t be themselves in the
classroom, whose stories aren't heard, even in social settings,
as well as in the academy,” Hunt said, "It's so easy for us to
ignore that. But here, this brings it to our face."

Guadalupe Rubio ’11, a friend of Guzman, feels that
such a public incident can open the daol' for a public re-
Spouse.

"I'm more empowered to know that we have support,"
Rubio said. “To know that people who are not personally
effected by this are standing with us."

Still, a statement so dismissive of her Latina identity
shook her faith in the Grinnell community.

“When d ' know who the perpetrator was, you

lose trust in everyone. Everyone becomes a suspect," Guz-
man said. “Everyone needs to show in their own way that
they don’t believe that, that those aren’t their views."

Gutierrez added, “we can't force people to hear our ere
periences, to hear us, we can only hope that they do."

As Hunt points out, no one action or set of actions will
be enough:

"Every year we get a new set ofstudents...who come from
different backgrounds. I’m sure we'll get some students who
come from communities that harbor racism and sexism and
homophobia, but here is where they come to college" Hunt
said. “The work has to continue every year, every semester,
and that’s the only way that change can come about." The
work is students telling their stories. The message is clear.

We Belong Here.
