Nancy and Mary: the faces behind athletics

They aren’t your ordinary secretaries—the champions of NCAA policy and witnesses of skimpy athletic attire

Nancy Bannrgartncr and Mary Kissinger
may not be familiar names for those who
do not participate in athletics at Grinncll.
Neither Nancy nor Mary, both secretaries
who are both slightly over the NCAA
eligibility age limits, hold school records
or have smiling pictures in Grinnell sports
programs. But behind tl\c' stories of wins
and losses, coach hirings and ﬁrings, tcants

' and individuals, Nancy and Mary ltelp keep
Grinnell Athletics moving flawlessly while
making students and staff feel a little more
at home.

Tlic job titles of administrative assistant
and athletic secretary, Nancy and Mary’s
official positions, go nowhere near explaining
their actual daily doings. Both go beyond
their duties to make Grinncll athletics
more enjoyable for everyone, "They’re
very welcoming and helpful," said varsity
swimmer cynis Mistry '11.

Besides helping with paperwork, Nancy
and Mary act as benevolent parenrs tor
forgetful or lazy students. The two seem
happy to work with the students. “I have an
incredible admiration for student athletes,"
said Nancy, “They put in hours ofdedlcation
just for rite love of their sporr."

Both Nancy and Mary have been working
at the college with Grinnellians longer than
most people on campus. Combined, the two
have over 30 years of experience working at
Grinnell. Nancy was hired by Grinnell in
1997 and moved to the athletic department
within the past few years. Mary has been
working in the Athletic Department since
1980, and with these years of experience
both have their fair share of Grinnell lore,
especially involving naked athletes.

"The first day l was working, I was
helping run a meet,”said Mary. "I remember
the swimmers all stood up and they turned
around and mooned everyone. Also, 1 always

remember when the men’s soccer team comes
running through here naked."

The stories go beyond just student-
athlctcs: “Of course, [Russell K. Osgood]
comes running in our building with his little
red shorts on, and nothing else," said Mary.
The job is unique, involving what Nancy
described as “people wearing very little
clothes.”

on a simple administrative level, Nancy
and Mary work wirh all rhe department’s
ofﬁcial business not covered by coaches
or athletic director Greg Wallace. As the

athletic secretary, Mary primarily deals with
“anything to do with money, ordering, paying
bills, hiring officials, schedules and so on,”
she said.

Nancy, as rhe administrative assistant
to the athletic director, acts as a secretary
to Wallace. She also works with NCAA
regulations and student paperwork, as well
as filling in the role of selfrdescr‘ibed “time
sheet empress” as the general supervisor for
athletic department employees. “Whether
you look at public relations they do
everything, to working with parents, to

communicating with faculty and staff, they
play a major role in pretty much everything,"
said Wallace.

Nancy and Mary's dedication goes beyond
the typical parameters of a weekday job.
Besides doing their required jobs and duties,
the two are true sports fans. Neither admits
to having a favorite sports team, but both
enjoy watching games and marches. “It's not
a five-day-a-week position." said Wallace.
“They're always here to help coordinate the
different things we’ve got going on."
