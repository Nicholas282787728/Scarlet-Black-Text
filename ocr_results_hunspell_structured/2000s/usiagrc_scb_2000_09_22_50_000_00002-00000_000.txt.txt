There S something

Urban sprawl

State legislator discusses environmental issues in campus lecture

’ by Mike Andersen
Staff writer

Iowa State Representative Ed Fallon is idco»
logically inclusive in his right against the effects
oturban sprawl.

“Anybody who believes in the free market
ought to be appalled,” he said during a Monday
presentation in the Forums south lounge. After a
brief pause, he added, “Even if you don't believe
in the tree marker, you ought to be appalled."

Fallon attempted to raise iowan awareness or
a national problem and guts
not support for his fall legis.
lative agenda with a 90.
minuteslide presentation and
discussion. A self-described
“independenttmindcd
Democrat" (and Nader supe
porter), Fallon, 42, lives in
Des Moincs and represents its
District 70 in the Iowa Gen-
eral Assembly.

“The whole pattern of
growth and development
right now is supported by a
tremendous imbalance in the
marker system,“ he explained Monday to thirty-
odd students, faculty. and city residents. “I’m not
saying that I'm against growth and development,
but this kind of building on lowa’s fatmland is
not what we want."

Fallon shared sratistics on iowans’ ﬂight to the
suburbs: while Des Moincs's population shrunk
by 4.1% between 1970 and 1990, its smaller
neighbors ballooned by as much as 133%, he said.
This migration was accompanied by a shirr to»
ward commuting workers 7 which in turn has
led to air pollution, sterile urban areas, and many,

many parking too.
He also shared the story oihis paren .iaw,

who were torced offthcir farm by a new highway.
“My kids cry, but that's not the point," he said
matter.ot.ractly. “What’s gonna happen? They’re
going to have some kind otsprawl that occurs on

"If you design something

the right way, to make it

attractive to people on
foot, they’ll come."

from Des Moines

every founlane."

“Every single counry in the state has rive or
seven stories like that,” he added.

Brevenrative policy, Fa’llon explained would
cut offsubsidics forhighways and Wal Marts and
instead support mass transportation Many re»
forms, such as intelligent zoning laws and con-
servative land annexation, would fall under the
responsibility otcities themselves.

Proper prior planning, he also said, would pay

-.off ﬁnancially in cities’ longstcnn budgets.

“if you design something
the right way, to make it at.
tractive to people on foot,
they'll come,” he said, citing
California's Disneyland as an
exampleotawellpianncdute
rracrive commercial develop.
ment that people pay to walk
through.

As well as proposing his
legislative effort as a fitst step,
Fallon dcscribcd “1000
Friends," a nonproﬁt group
whose lowa chapter he
founded and which aims to
educate lowans on issues ofurban sprawl and ru-
ral preservation.

Fallon also spoke in support of bill Mcnncr,
the Democratic candidate for Grinnell's House
District, who was among the audience, asking
Grinneliians to “send him my way.”

After graduating from Drake University and
before running for fllC Iowa House in 1992, Fallon
was a professional musician and nonviolent ac.
tivist. During his time in the legislature, he has
introduced hills which would condemn sweatshop
labor, forbid public discrimination against homos
scxuals, and remove the Iowa Air Guard from one
torcei-ricnrorno.t1y zones over Iraq. He went on
a hunger strike to protest lowas 1995 ﬂirtation
with reinstatement ofcapital punishment.

He is also as.yct.unopposcd in his fourth re.
election bid this November.

U’wa protest

Protest, continued from p. 1

few blocks from the headquarters and regrouped
before arriving all at once at the Democratic head-
quarters.

When the ofﬁce's employees saw the Call to Act
tioii bus pulling up (sides plastered with activist
messages), they looked the doors and stayed inside.
Protesters poured out and surrounded the S|X lock»
downs.

“Hey Al, play fair! Don’t be such a
millionaire!"

A Des Moines Register photographer was the
ﬁrst main person to come; he saw the protest on
theway to another assignment and stopped to rake
picruras. soon he was not alone Television, print
and radio journalists were at the site interviewing
protesters, Democratic employees and polite,

At the same time, activists handed our leaders
at a nearby intersection and continued channng
and waving signs at the passing trains

The police kept a close eye on the protest tor
the first few hours but error it was evident that moth»
ing the protesters were doing was actually illegal—
tliey wereon public land and didn't pose a threat—
they tort.

Although there was no response from Gore hlme
selr, late in the arternoon, the students did talk with
the manager ofthe Des Moines since when he was
coming back to the othet from a break. They talked
about the U’wa and sorts silence on the issue. The
core starter said that he was glad to see students
interested in political issues, bur that core was the
wrong target, Gore was working through "proper
diplomatic channels" to try and solve the problems
in Columbia,

”No more blood for oil! Oxy off of
U’Wa soil!”

After ﬁve hours orproresting, and with rhe six
students still locktd down, the group decided their
had met their goals or attracting media attention
and raising awareness.They unlocked and the pro
test ended.

one or those locked down, sarsh Kogeh
sinucker ’01, said that the point wasn‘t how much
stock core had or irit was actually in his name or
his mother's; it’s about power..“Evcryonc who had
power,” shesaid, “has a moral obllgauon to use it.”
