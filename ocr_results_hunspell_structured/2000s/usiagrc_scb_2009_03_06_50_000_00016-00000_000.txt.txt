We have conducted our
own poll this week, to discover
what it is that Grinnell men
dislike about Grinnell womr
en. Sit down, girls, and brace
yourselves.

First and foremost, the boys
thinkyou're sloppy. They think
your hair is unkempt and your
clothes the geeeleonly~gotr
up-ﬁve-minutes-before-class
look. They don't like bue
jeans, babushkas, or poor co or
schemes.

You are, in the opinion of
the Grinnell men, poor con-
versationalists. You either ta
to little, or too much, nhout t ie
wrong things—-ol hoyfrien s,
for exam vle.

 

 

 

 

 

 

THlS WEEKEND: Alter starting things orfi right with DPDP this Fri-
day, prepare to have yoLII world flipped upside clown on Saturday

THUMBS DOWNS: Why do we have to be so negative about some

thing every week?

 

 

Students speak
about what’s on
their minds in 142
words or fewer,
and you’re invitedl
If you have a rant,
e-mail it to
[hortonmo]. Com-
plaining in a public
forum is always
more fun than do»
ing it alone

0n getting trailer trashed

Trailer rrnshed? Really orinneII College?
You come here from the East Coast and Calif
fornin and the Chicago suburbs and you’re going
ro dross up in ovemlls, drink Keystone, snunhio
around to Cotton Eye Joe and not even fccl bad
about it? Did you go and pregame ar the trailer
pink in Grinnell? How about smoke 1| bowl with
the ladies who are living at Mitchellville {or the
rest of their Lives because they had a math lalS in
their house? For a campus so dedicated to being
hare free we sure managed to hate a whole lot
or people in one night. Call me “politically cor-
reu":ind humorless. Sure, it was “all in good fun
Well some people think dressing in black face.
drinking 405 and grinding to Nelly is “an in good
fun,"Yeah, that’s pretty funny

To the squirrels of campus

STOP CHEWING THROUGH MY
SCREEN AND TRYING TO BREAK INTO
MY ROOM. I know you think that food looks
good bur it is my goddamn food und 1 dour \Vanr
lo shne u wirh you. Also did you really rhink
that the 1 cm that I now leave my window open
was big enough to get through, you moron. Do
you rhinkl «in going ro keep Ienving my window
open so you on just come and hang our. 1 must
admit It was Ieally funny watching you panic and
squiim between my window nnd" screen becnuse
ofyour entrinee and escape routes but now there
no two gnping hoIes in my screen and FM iusr
ﬁxed it. Ifyou don’t want tornl win then STAY
OUT otherwise I will rcson to more drastic
measures.
