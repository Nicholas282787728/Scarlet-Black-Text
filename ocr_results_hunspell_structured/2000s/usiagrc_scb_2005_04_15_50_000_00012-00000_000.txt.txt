There were a lot of really well balanced teams,"
Lyon said, butemphnsized that in no wnv were the
Grinncllians intimidated by infamously sti‘ffcompeti—
tion like Yale and the UniverSity ofTexas. However,
he admitted some frustration when confronted with
“35-year-old grad students" and added, “it doesn't
count ifyou're on your fourth I’li.D.l”

somewhere in top 16 out of the 220 teams nationally

was met by silence and then the response, “\Nhat the

the answer to the gioup and then moved on, saying
“Next year, we will sweep Nationals!”

Last weekend, the men’s tennis
squad played a grueling amy schedule
that took them to Rock Island, Ill. on
Friday where they played noneconfcre
ence opponent Augustana College. On
Saturday, they traveled to Beloit play
an early match. Later in the day, they
drove to Waukesha, Wisconsin to face
Carroll.

Friday’s foray against Augustana
can be summarized simply as dramatic,
with Grinnell eventuallylosing in aveiy
tight match. Eli Best ‘07, playing at the
no. 2 spot, claimed a thrilling victory
over Augustana’s Dan Rooney, with the
match stretching out to three full sets.
Kushal Shah ‘06 and DJ. Warden ‘08
also provided victories at singles, but
their wins were not enough to secure
the singles point for Grinnell. With the
march tied 3-3, junior Don Martinez of
Augustana rallied to a stirring 2-6; oz;
o2 win against Brij Patnaik ‘05. That
allowed the Vikings to clinch a 473 win
over the Pioneers.

The squad quickly shook off
this disappointment and came
back in full force the following day.
Against Beloit, the Pioneers put on a

strong performance at singles competi-
(ion, winning four oftheir six matches.
Jordan Lee ‘08 quashed his Beloit opt
ponent 6-0 5-0, and Rick Fenbert ‘oo,
Patnaik and Ohm also managed to win
with relative ease.

The squads performance in the
doubles part of the tournament was by
far the most impressive.While normally
the Achilles’ heel of its game, on this oer
casion, the team stepped it up a notch at
doubles play and won all three matches.
Final score: Grinnell 5, Beloit 2.

With an early victory under their
belt, the Pioneers went off to face Care
roll in the afternoon. Their defeat of
Carroll was even more one-sided than
against Beloit. At singles, the men won
five of six matches, losing only at the
no. 3 positioii.Their doubles play again
was impressive, as the duos of no. 1 Pat-
naik/Lee,‘ no. 2 FenbctL/Warden, and
no. 3 Best/Julian West ‘06 till won their
respective matches.

This weekend, the team will play at
home, facing perennial arch-rivals Ri~
pon College, Lawrence University and
Central CollegeThe matches will take
place on the outside tennis courts on
ma, Ave., weather permitting.

The men and women’s track and field teams have
a week off from intercollegiate competition as they
re-energize after the Warthurg invitational and pre-
pare for their signature home meet: the Dick Young
Classic. Both teams had some positive overall and
individual performances last Saturday, as the men ﬁn’
ishcd in 11th place of 12 and the women ﬁnished in
11th place of 15. The place finish may be a bit mis—
leading, however, as the runners and field competitors
ready prepare for the important meets at the end of
the season.

The women had some impressive individual efe
forts across the board, Sarah spencer ‘08 was Grins
nell's top finisher as she ﬁnished third in the 5000—
meter race with a time of 18:26.86 (4th best time in
school history). Erin Booth ‘07 finished eighth in the
5k,whilc Katie Ryan ‘07 finished ninth.Allison Low
than ‘08 placcd fourth in the 10k and Erin Sindewnld
‘08 finished seventh. Renae Youngs ‘05 took sixth in
the hammer throw with a toss of 103 feet, 4 inches.
These individual maiks will be good indicators for the
coaches as to how to prepare for not only conference,
hut for the Dick Young.

“It was good to get in our first outdoor meet hack
in town," said coach Evelyn Freeman. “it was a very
high quality meet which included lots of nationally
ranked teams. It will be great to have the team (0*
gether again at our home meet on the 23id. A number

or our sprinters had a good outing. our field event
athletes didn’t have a stellar meet but should perform
much better shortly.”

The men's team also had good individual perfore
mances that coach Will Freeman will look to build on
in the coming weeks. David Honig ‘06 was the team’s
top finisher as he ﬁnished fourth in the 5000-metet
race. Colin Tschida ‘05 finished fifth in the 30007me—
ter steeplcchase, while Mitch Hen ‘06 took eighth
place. Chad Rapp ‘07 finished ninth in the hammer
throw with a throw of 144 feet, 5 inches. Brian Law-
son ‘06 cleared 13 feet, 3 inches to finish lOth in the
pole vault competition, while Ross Stutzman ‘07 was
ninth in rhe high jump with a jump of 5 feet. 9.25
inches.

Both Freemans and their arhlercs will now pre-
pare for the Dick Young Classic. to be hold in Grin-
nell next Saturday.

“The Dick Young is always important to the ream."
said Evelyn Freeman. “It's our only home meet so the
other teams must compete on our turf. Our athletes
always enjoy performing before the home crowd and
many of their friends come to help with the meet.
We're always looking for improved performances and
a number ofour athletes will be performing in events
that they haven't had a chance to compete in up to
this point. We’re also hoping for great weather to pro-
duce some competitive seed times for Conference."
