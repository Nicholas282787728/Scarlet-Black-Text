0 HUSBANDS -- DEAD OR ALIVE

(Reprinted from May 13 issue of
Varsity Magazine)

In a poll conducted recently by Williams
college men some very intliguing informa-
tion was uncovered anent college women’s
ultimate disposal of their husbands in case
the U. S. becomes involved in Europe’s
war. Smith girls were faced with the ques-
tion, “If it were a matter of choice would
you rather have your husband imprisoned
for conscientious obj ction or be killed in
Europe?” Smith girls, no more savage»
looking than those of any other school, had
their surface scratched, showed their true
colors by voting for a dead husband

This surprising action brings to mind
those women during the last war who, safe
in London, prowled the sidewalks pinning
white feathers indiscriminately on men in
mufti, trying to shame them into the army.
Not at all rare were injured veterans home
from the front who were publicly decorated.
Those grevious errors bothered Britain‘s
ghoulish girls not in the least. They went
their merry Way with their turkey quills,
shaming men, often unfit, more often honest
objectors, into the trenches and on into
muddy graves. Possibly Smith girls would
never go as far as feathers, bllt they are
sisters of those who would.

Their comment that they would “prefer
a dead hero to a live’ objector” is naive, to
say the least. Can it be that Smith girls
believe that men who march away from
home to fight in modern wars go without
fear? The husbands Smith girls get will be
just as frightened facing bayonets as those
of any other girls. Fear of being afraid
drives most modem “heroes” to their beds
of barbed wire and blood. Fear of being
thought afraid by their college-educated
wives will, if by catastrophic circumstance,
America becomes involved ill the war, drive
many a man who married a Smith girl to a
“hero’s" grave.

To men, standing today in the shadow
of war, Smith opinion must be encouraging.
To those who want a fight it probably won’t
make much difference. They can go ahead,
pick a wife at Smith and march away, con—
fident that the girl they left behind will
bring up the baby on a balanced diet of
war talk and martial music to the full and
final realization that his old man was a
hero. But to those who want no part of a
fight, not because they are cowards but be-
cause they honestly object to carrying a
gun in Europe, must hesitate when they
learn that Smith girls wollld rather read
their names on a casualty list than see
them for twenty minutes every other Tucs—
day on the other side of a grating in the

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

federal pen.

To them, perhaps, a glance towards
Poughkeepsie, New York, would be more
comforting. There, in the self»same poll,
Vassar girls voted that they‘d prefer a hus»
hand all in one piece, convictions and all,
to the memory of one who marched away.

The question arises as to why the girls
at these two institutions, all with approxi-
mately the same backgrounds, should take
opposite stands on the ultimate disposal of
their husbands if war-comes. If the poll
results circulate widely enough the mar—
riage market at Vassar should boom, that
of Smith slump with every disquieting ru-
mor from abroad.

(Editor’s note: The question also arises:
What say Grinnell coeds?)

0 BLAST IT, WE'RE MAD!

An open letter to the powers who are rc-
spollsible for the food (7) we get at this
institution:

Frankly, dear powers-that—be, we believe
we are as patient and uncomplaining as most
normal Amelican citizens, playing the con-
tented cow at least half of the time. In
fact, We don’t object too strenuously to eat-
ing meat out of which all the taste has been
cooked, and We even contrive to drink the
“weballdt—coffce" served morning, noon and
night.

Nor do we get more than mildly hysteri-
cal over the more or less steady dessert»dict
of fruit—cup and custard.

Bllt, confound it all, when we are served
soured potatoes that reek like an unwashed
garbage pail, as we were last night in the
men’s dining room, then we admittedly blow
a fuse. And when we are confronted with
corn fritters which have been burnt to a
delicate BLACK crisp, as we were just re-
cently, our blood—pressure mounts to alarm-
ing levels.

We hate to mention the fact, but we
are paying enough in board bills to warrant
good food ALL of the timeiand not just
when the cook happens to be feeling chipper.
How about it? Do we continue to subsist
on the “dirty grey meat special," plus half—
rotten spuds, as advertized in the Black and
Blue? Or will you, out of the kindness of
yours hearts—and ollr moneyggive us a
break more than three days a week?

0 CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS?

A few years ago, a big, rangy freshman
went out for track at Grinnell. He could
throw the javelin, bllt he could hardly turn
around in the discus circle—let alone throw
the discus any appreciable distance. This
year, he won the discus event in the State
Teachers relays, the Beloit relays, and got
fifth place in the Drake relays competing
with some of the outstanding men in the
country. He showed this improvement be—
cause of hard work on his part and good
coaching on the part of G. Lester Duke,
track mentor.

At the beginning of this year, Mr.
Duke as well as Grinnell college as a whole
looked foreward to the track season with
anything but anticipation. Many of the
best track men had graduated, and the
team this year was to be made up of a
group of inexperienced sophomores and
transfer students

The team started slowly, and through—
out the indoor seasou it was handicapped by
hard luck and inexperience. At one of the
meets, one of the team’s best ullncrs fell
down and pulled a muscle in his leg when
the relay team was doing well in a big
race. The outdoor season still 'l'ouud the
team faced with the same difficulties. They
were badly defeated by a larger school,
State Teachers, in their first outdoor meet.
Throughout the outdoor season, however,
the track team has shown steady improve-
ment.

This Saturday will find the Grillnell
track team at the conference meet at Gales-
burg, 111., with a better chalice to grab
the championship than we have had in any
other ma. 1- sport this year. The Scarlet
and Black, speaking for the student body,
wishes to commend the fine coaching of
Mr. Duke, and the excellent way the team
has come up this season. Good luck teams.
