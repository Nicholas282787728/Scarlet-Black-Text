Attcr losing their league openr
er to Lm"encc Saturday, Coach
Oalies' varsity squad Will make
a strong bid to even up Corie
ton's lragiie record as well as to
maintain thc lead which the Pio-
neers have built up since the
two teams first clashed in 1892.

With me encouraging reception
of loyal Grinnelllans who gath»
cred on Ward field Sunday to
welcome the defeated Pionecr
squad, the team has been prac-
ticing this week with a renewed
vigor and spirit wluch promises
to give the Carls a hard-fought
contest

The one game experience which
the Lawrence Vikings rendered
to us last week has given such
sophomore newcomers to the
varsity as Hooks, Theophilus,
Gregg, Bigclow, and itduddell
among others a chance to iron
out some of their rlaws during
the week, and should give them
more confidence going into to-
night's game,

lettermen Return,

Among bright aspects on the
Grinnell squad lies in the return
ct two tripleethl'eat veterans of
last season 7 Johnny Bonyata
and Bill Bouma. Besides Ben»
yata's great speed (he won the
Midwest conference championr
ship in the 100 and 220 yard
dashes during the last two
years), he is a capable passer.

Filling in for the ailing Stern—
heck last season, Bouma, also a
trackman, was in the starting
lineup for the rinai three games,
and should prove to he a val-

uable asset to the squad this
