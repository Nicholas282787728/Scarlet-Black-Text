GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Just as Liesegang rings are made
up of potassium dichrornate salts
and silver nitrate in gelatin solue
tion, so the Grinnell chemistry de-

P. Sherman, professor of cheme
istry, and Dr. William c. Oelke,
associate professor at chemistry,
in the medium of the three floors
of Blair Hall.

A newcomer m the Grinnell
campus would scarcely suspect
rather stately Blair hall of house
ing the laboratories and lecture
rooms used in the four chemistry
courses. Up on the third floor
is located the laboratory tor BI
,and BS beginning courses in
chemistry. Here Frances Greet
‘aiid Bettie Neville, laboratory as
,sistants, help Dr. Sherman as he
has his first year class make
crystals from zinc and lead solu-
tions or test the miscibility of
lvarious solutions. Located in this
‘lab is the apparatus by which
the chemistry department pro-
vides itself with its own distilled
water: There is a total of forty
students enrolled in this course.

On the east side of the building
on the first floor is located the
ilab used by the tive students en»
rolled in qualitative analysis this
.fall. Qualitative analysis is the
'tall course of the sophomore year,
iWhlle quantitative analysis is the
ispl'ing work Here are located
‘the indiVidual test tube racks den
veloped by Dr. Oelke.

i Eight students are enrolled in
.thc organic chemistry course,
‘lwhich is the third year work cAnd
up at the top of the department:
‘al- students hierarchy are located
two senior girls who are doing
iwork in physical chemistry and
isenlur colloqumm.

It is in this select group that
being produced As Dr. Sherman
put it the rings sort of resemble
l“liver." Ruth Fagan and Lucy
Tlowbridge who have cultured
the rings are also developing
some very interesting copper sul-
phate crystals in an elaborate ap-
paratus, In the same lab is lo-
l rated the glass blowing equipment
’with which the department manu-
ltaetures most of the glass ma-
‘tcrials used in the labs.

0n the ground floor in the cor-

are various exhibits mounted for
