Divide Germany

For Peace-—Mann

By Milton Stern—

Falitor’s Note:

This is the second in a series of articles on tile

instructors brought to Grinneu by the AST. In the following inter-
view, trainee Stern discllssas “The Coming Surrender of Germany"
.tvltll Dr. Eric Mann, noted lecturer on history and geography.

Dr. Mann started his American lecturing career in 1937 when he

spoke under the sponsorship of

the National Geographic Sociey

in Washington, D. C. Previously he had toured the world as an

actor and opera singer.

He appeared before New York so

lices

n the Max Reinhardt Midsummer Night's Dream production of

the 1920’s.
with William Dieterlc.

Throughout his acting career,
however, Mann continued his lec~
turing. As he said himself, "I
would play Hamlet in the evenings
and I would lecture on Austria in
the mornings."

When in 1933, Herr Hitler ovei'r
ran Austria, . Mann dropped his
acting cal-cc and.turned solely to
lecturing. His desire to study liv-
ing people and their strange cus-
toms carried him for the next ten
years to far-off corners of the
world. in Czechoslovakia, he lived
with the peasants. in Sweden, he
lived with the iron ore mine work-
ers. in India, he lived with the
Bengal Lancers.

eDurin‘g‘ his travels he has met
many leading persons in every
field; actors first, statesmen and
educators later. He still con-
tinues h‘i‘s acquaintance with many
in both lines, such as Greta Gar-
bo and Hedy LaMarr on‘one side,
the minister of education in co;
lumbiz, Dr. Cenieros, in Mexico
on the other. His travels, his ex-
periences served as material for
his continuous lecturing in Ame-
ican univer 'ties including Chl-
eagu and Pittsburgh. Previous to
his arrival in Grinnell, Mann was
giving a lecture course series at
New York University.

South Germany, his eyes seemed
to twinkle with pleasant merri-
ories. But when he spoke ol the
Prussian sense of militarism, his
eym ﬁred with hutmtl.

“Occupy Germany as long as
the slightest vestige of Fl'ilssi'ul
militarism oxism. No gun nor
knife should be left on the belt
of one single German police of
cer. The allies should be the po-
lice."

Dr. Mann would have us occupy
Germany completely, with no par

litical nor economic freedom tori

as long as the occupation lasts.
The German wants a soldier to
be stiff and military. The Ger-
man wants to be told to do some»
thing, he doesn't want to be
asked. And this is the policy the
occupation army should adopt it
any success should be hoped for.

Dr. Mann would have no deal-
ings with the Junkers, the mili-
tary, nor the industrialists. He
would have no dealings with any
politicos who served during the
Weimar Republic. For these men
not only failed utterly in defend»
mg their country against Nalem,
but led the way with their Panr

Gerinanism and their attempt to-

bring Germany into a. leading posir
tion in the world.
No Economic Freedom

"Take away their economic
freedom No ecomonic prosper»
ity. This could be welded into n
political power.”

“But, Dr. Mann
all very well, but you cant de-
stroy a nation. These people, no
matter how bad they are, have to
live."

“Yes, yes. Complete and severe
occupation of Germany will secure
peace. Germany must also be
slowly re-educated, the youth of
Germany. The older people have
gone too far. The teachers should
not be foreign. They should not
try to force a foreign culture.
Germany has a liberal culture in
Goethe. Lead them back to Goethe
and thathould be enough. A
small but exlstirlg liberal hand
may grow and some day take con
trol of the government.

“For soldiers, like the ASTP, to
go to a country, to know the lan»
guage, to understand the peole
it is a wonderful ideal. it is an
idea possible only in America.“

There you have the core of Dr.
Mann's position on what to do
with Germany after the war. He
has maintained these opinions in
hlS lectures throughout the world.
And now ivith the ASTP, he is

 

hoping for their fulfillment.

Will Hold Glamour Show

Mt}! Co-Ed’s Supplying Glamour

.{u
1mm Davina—

Based on the assumption that
the War will last a. few more
weeks, and that civilian morale

is sadly in need of a trans-
fusion in the humor vein, the
1.5T Trainees on the campus have
decided to produce a musical
show in collaboration with the
USO.

This show will] gags, gals and
glamour, according to Pvt. Fred-
eric Nederlander, chairman of
the directing committee, “is
strictly original and is the that
attempt of its kind by a military
unit stationed on this campus."
Aiding Pvt. Nederlander in pro—
ducing the show are Pvt. (ic)
Carl Adamo and Corp, Mario Yon.

Heading the performance will
be a quartet of glamour, namely,
Vivian standing, Ann crews,
Ruth Bergland and Shirley Minar
and a. quartet of soldiers, Harry
Priester, Joseph “Tiny" Gerard,
William Limpert, and Robert
Watson.

steph Otto, Carl Schroeder,
Walter Valverdes, and Pascal
Scale, aiding in gag and script
writing, also lend their talents
in acting. At present it is pldnr
ned to have this show in the high
school auditorium, and chairman
Nederlander expresses his desire
that anyone with talent and
ability should get in touch with
him, or a member of the com-
mittee to try out for a part in
the show.

AIIoI'menl
Of Sem Fees

iApproved

Increase for Individual

Acﬁvilies' Due +0 Loss
Of Aillleﬁc Fund

The White House and the drama
department have been added to
the list of student activities as-
sisted tinaneially by the appor-
tionment of the semester fee for
194344, and the allotments of all
other student organizations have
been increased according to the
studant organizations budget
which was approved by the facul-
ty on Oct. 4.

All these increases and addi-
tions to the budget as compared
with last year are in terms or per
centages, the actual money in-
volvcd being in most cases small-
er than last year, due to the de»
creased enrollment. The entire se-
mester fee this year is $190.62.

However, the ellminat' n of
athletics as a student acti ily on
the semester tee apportionment
this year, gives a larger cash
fund than might otherwise be ex-
pected. Athletic allahnents for the
past several years have consti-
tuted over half of the entire fund.

The fee is based on the payment
of $7.50 for each 317 students,
minus 20 per cent for handling
and default on payments. One per
cent of the fund is valued at
519.02, and the following appor-
tionments are in terms of percent-
ages,

Art exhibitions, 1.3; band, 7.2;
board of religion. 1.5; chc , glee
club, orchestra, 5. , 10.5-
