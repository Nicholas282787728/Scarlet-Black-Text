The real purpose and need for
money tor the Chinese movement

plained the present Chinese situ-
ation, and by a letter from Alice
Reed, '13, who is in china at the

said that China is now beset by
Fascist and Communist propa-
ganda, and that only a united
China can hope to overcome the
dangers which thneaten it.

In this try for internal unity,
the role of the mission school
cannot be overestimated, Fessler
continued.

Students Ask for Chapel Programs
With Music, and Talks by Stevens

Music, more talks by President
Samuel N. Stevens, and student
programs have the majority vote
on chapel programs, according to
a survey made yesterday by the
Scarlet and Black.

Explicit statements were made
by a representative student body.
Juanita Moi-timer, Haines senior,
said, “Music, especially instru-

many dialects,"
Miss Reed's Letter,

Bearing out this contention
was the letter of Miss Reed, re-
ceived by the alumni office,
which stated that the favorable
rate of exchange, one American
dollar representing a value of
eight dollars in China, made
each contribution doubly valuable,

Miss Reed's message told, fur-
ther, that the total enrollment of
the mission this year was 315. of
these, 111 arc girls. The faculty
numbers 20.

John C. Fctzer, assistant to the
president, requested today that
those students who plan to take
part in the Grinnell Job Survey
turn in their applications and 10
dollar deposits as soon as pos-
sible.

Surveys, according to present
plans, Will be held in Chicago,
Des Moincs, and Minneapolis. Be-
cause no applications for iiitcr—
views in Omaha or St. Louis have

conducted in those cities.

According to Fctzcr, more than
100 companies in Chicago have
been asked to participate in the
Ci-iniiell Job Survey program, The
college wn arrange six interviews
for each student; and the student
may also arrongc for two in addi~
tion on his own initiative. Each
person participating will take part
in two interviews tlaily.

John Poolcy, instructor in busi-
ness admiuistration, will be in
charge of the Des Moines suivo
Calvm Deming, director of pupil
ity, will head the Minneapolis
survey; and Fctzer will be in
chargc of the Chicago group.

“If enough students are inter-
ested, groups of students will be
able to tour some of the major
places of interest in the three
cities,” Fetzer said.

Water Supply

Explained By
L. V. Phelps

Official Aclion Taken
To Remove Current
Waier-Slench Problem

Louis V. Phelps, treasurer of
Grinnell college, stated today
ill a letter to the Scarlet and
Black that both the college
officials and the Iowa South—
ern Utilities company are
Seriously working on the
problem of the college water sup-
ply; and that both parties u-ill
continue to investigate the prob-
lein until the trouble has been
eliminated.

Sihmlion Explained.

Explaining the situation, Phelps
writes: “The water furnished by
the City of Grinncll contains an
abnormal amount of hardness and
is practically unfit for boiler food
water. Consequently, the Iowa
Southern Utilities company buys
its boiler feed water from the
supply at Arbor Lake.

“This water goes through the
boilers and comes out in the
form of steam, which is piped to
the central plant on the college
campus and is distributed
through the radiators all over the
campus. This steam cools as it
goes through the pipes and radi-
ators and goes back to the big
tank in the heating plant in the
form of warm water. It is about
as pure as water can he, except
for the occasional foul smell.
Very hot steam is piped directly
into the tanks containing the
warm condensation and this is
then pumped to the vaiious
dormitories for the hot water
supply.
