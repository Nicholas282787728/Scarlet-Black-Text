HOT RODS, SHOT RODS
ARE DIFFERENTIATED

Phoenix, Arizona — (AC?)—
Zack Mosley, sinilin' Jack car-
toonist has nothing on a “Bear
Tracks" feature writer when it
comes to hot rods,

When the average person reads‘
a newspaper story headlined
“hot rod driver arrested" he pic.
tures an automobile of about
1928 vintage, fenders gone, fill—
ed with assorted noises and not
quite mechanically sound, The
driver oi said conveyance is
usually pictured as someone ap-
proaching the state ol 3 Mom
golian idiot.

Junker is the mime that should
be applied to the above bucket
oi bolts; not hot rod A hot rod
is a track roadster with a stan-
dard-size stock body of unaltere
cd contour, powered by an
American Automobile Produe-t
tion engine of 300 cubic inch dlSr
placement or less. A hot rod,
must Iiai’ze all the glass removed
from the body, doors securely
fastened, metal fire wall and
full hood, positive neutral clutch,
hydraulic brakes and a fuel

 

shut~off valve within easy reach
of the driver.

Ask a iunker pilot what he's
running llnd the answer will
probably consist of either a
blank stare or a tale that will
match one of H. C, Anderson's
The engine is electronically bal-
anced and uses Navarro 9
heads set on a ’40 Mere of 263
cu. inches. The bore is three and
fiveesixleemlis while the crank
has hen stroked one-eighth of
an inch by Miller,

Maybc 3 2e received the
celestial light and now under-
stand that a roadster or hot rod
is not a drivable wreck but is a
)lilndrbuilt automobile, more

n-cltilly put together than the
high-priced Detroit products.
