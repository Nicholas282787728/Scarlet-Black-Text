Ounce of Preven’rion---

Once again reform has reared its battered
head in editorial board meeting. Not only
reform, but also the editorial writers are
much battered, for they have been attempt-
ing to go down to the bookstore after the
elusive mail.

And there are steps down to the book—
store. At least there were, before two weeks
of snow and ice accumulated during vacac
tion. Now there are only six or seven slight-
ly larger bumps hidden among the collection
of ice,

We don’t come right out and say the
bookstore boys or the housekeeping depart-
ment should get busy 'with picks and find
the steps again. We offer them the alterna
tive of providing students with toboggans
to get down, and of installing a ski lift for

GRINNELL SCA'RLET AND BLACK

The old Varsity club and the more recent
Gadabouts tried for years to schedule a
winter carnival'on this campus. The preps
even now are squeezing money for a skating
rink. But the Grinnell students don’t take
advantage of their opportunities. Just drop
over to the bookstore anytime. Let Sun Val-
ley close for the duration. We always have
the bookstore steps. And we'll probably
have just as many broken legs by spring.

The Baby's Named-n

An editorial of last week suggesting a name
for the new student recreation center has
brought forth the comment from one army
officer that the White House sign now on
post headquarters will be cheerfully sacri-
ficed by army personnel if some college
official will merely request such a move.

According to this officer, the sign has
remained on the old White House porch
because it was fastened to the premises and
thus considered college property not to be
tampered with. It is not needed by the army
school for purposes of identifying the head-
quarters building. '

We gleefully report these facts, in the
hope that the deans', or president’s or
housekeepers office will act upon them.
The term “White House” has definite con—
notations in Grinnell. Those connotations are
the reason the name is excellent for our
new recreation center and very poor for
army headquarters. Now that the sign has
been pronounced “not G. I," we suggest it
be brought back home as soon as possible,
and we take off‘our collective hat to the

army for grasping so readily our point of

the return trip.
