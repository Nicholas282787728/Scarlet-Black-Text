lnframural Program

G‘RTNNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

To Con’rinue

Wll'l'l Baskel‘ball and Volleyball

By Bill Fox
Detailed plans tor the coming iii-
tramural program have been also
laycd until an order of basketball
shoes tor the army arrives on or
about Nov. 1, according to John
c. Truesdale, athletic director
However, it is known that the
army and Macy House W111 put up
both basketball and volleyball
teams.

Obviously due to the lack of
manpower, the college is unable
to continue intercollegiate ache
letics this year. However, a high
ly competitive intramural program
has been substituted ior varsity
teams, This tall various teams
from the army units stationed
here and one trom the college men
have competed in touch—tootball.
True, the color and atmosphere or
the big contest was lacking, How-
ever, the fellows who participated
not only enjoyed themselves, hut
also put on some good games

On interiiiittant Sundays, two
teams, again GI, drew (an sized
crowds with some real tackle
football. Again, the color was
lacking, but the brand ot ball
played was good, and excitement
ran high.

The winter promises continu-
ation, even on a bigger scale, 01
the program already begun. Prom
ably, when the army’s shoes or-
rive, ,a volleyball tournament will
start things ott. While the Lollrne -
ment is progressing, basketball
teams Will be practicing; and at
the close ot volleyball, a regular
basketball schedule will begin,

All in all. the situation is not
at all discouraging, at least for
those who plan to participate.
