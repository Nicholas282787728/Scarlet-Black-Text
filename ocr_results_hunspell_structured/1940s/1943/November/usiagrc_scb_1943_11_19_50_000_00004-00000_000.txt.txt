“MY DAY"

Today was a my interesting
day. 1 was aroused by the muse
ieal tiiikle of Keith Baird's voice
singing, uTime to fall out.‘
Jumping quickly out of hed I
swept the dust from my room
under my suite- mates bed and
went rollicking off to class.

First period was rather hor-
ing. stotts kept snoring so none
of the rest of us could sleep.
The rest of the morning passed
uneventfully.

Lunch was es illng, We spent
most of the time speculating on
what we were eating. During
the afterdjnner smoke, I had an
intellectual conversation with
MeLennon on whether it is pos-
sible to receive third degree
borne by using three matches in
a hot-foot. “Mac" demonstrated
the “Three Match Theory on Pvt.
(the pride of the South) Hamil-
ton. "A typical Yankee trick,”
shouted Hamilton as he danced
around trying to pull the smoulr
dering shoe off of his foot. I

won the betionly second degree,

burns on ”Ham's” foot.

We had gym this afternoon
with wrestling as the main event.
Neiilei-laiider won a striking
match over a crippled cat which
had wandered into die gym.
Limpert and Caniery battled for
three minutes, with Mr. Trues»
dale coming out the victor, The
best event was Land and Me-
Grathithey haven't been un-
taiigled yet.

At retreat the advanced boys
. put on a show. They marched
along in formation Wlth the sees
