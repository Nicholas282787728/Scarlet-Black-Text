VVhlle Fieweger was putting on
a one man show, Grinncll and
Monmouth battled it out for lun-
nel'rup honors. The Pioneers edged
into second place by winning the
mile relay, final cvent on the pro-
gram. Bl-Imie Vsnstriim, Gene
McCui-dy, Harry Waters, and
Koert Voorliecs luggcd the baton
for thc Victorious quartet, which
boosted the scarlet and black to-
tol to 47 points, just enough to
head Monmolith’s M 1/2.

In thc‘ also ran bracket wcrc
Corncll with 32 points, Coc with
21, and Knox with 17.

Flewegel', who broke his own
record in the 120 yard high hur-
dles with a 148 perfoimancc, also
copped tlrc lircad jump, high jump,
shot put. and 100 yard dash, was
Lawrence's mail of tho hour.

However, othcr outstanding ef-
forts were racked up hy Bill Lax-
ori of Monmouth and Dave Clue
tel-1mm of Cornell.

Laxon accomplished what was
thought to he the impossihle when
he edged out Fieweger for blue
ribbon honors in the 220 yard low
hurdles. In so doing, Laxoii chop-
ped two-tenths of a second from
the ,previous record which had
stood sincc Rcay of Carleton set

tancc man, distinguished himself
during thc afternoon‘s proceedings
by copping the mile, two inilc, and
