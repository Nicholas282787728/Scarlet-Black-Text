Two forces were at work against Grinnell
athletics this yea : a.) the last two gradilav
tions; is.) the armed service calls. The dearth
of athletes was especially noticed at the
beginning of this track season. Lester Duke
had two track letter men returning to the
squad; prospects were not bright, but hope
burned high. Mr. Duke is indeed to be com-
plemented and congratulated on the shown
ing of the track team this season. It has

been nothing short ol' remarkable. He is
fortunate to lizcve had men on his squad who
were not licked when the odds were an linst
them. The entity of Mr. Dulce and the boys
was one which has exemplified the oft-tall;—
ed about. historic ”Spirit of old Grinnell,"
Unless there was confident leadership to
guide the men and the will to win solidly illlr
liued withing the thil ids, the record or
winninrr econd in the h dewest Coni'elence
meet, ll t ill the Coe-Grinuell dual meet,
and at g‘Cnd third in the Pre—Flig‘ht, Antes
Crinncll Triangular, and a place in tlle Drake
Relays could never have been made. To Say
that Duke has ”made something out of nothr
ing, " a falsehood. He has developed much
from a fine nucleus, and polished up the
ablllL of men who never thought they were
ya it; caliber. This quality of making the
best of what you have is tr dition at Grill-
nell. Mr. Duke has indeed added another
month to the lallrels of Grinnell track.

Whether the boys have “on the meet
this afternoon or not, we know that they
have entered the contest with the over
wllelming desile to do so. They have never
let down; we know they never will. The
track teziln can well represent all the ath-
letic teams Grinnell has put ill action this
year. They have been handicapped and to a
man have shown a spirit of fight and deter-
mination for which the rest 01' the student
body and alumnae can well be proud. No
matter what their place in the meet today,
we can glance at the record and cheerfully
Say, “They dood itl”
