Nollen’s Biography of Grinnell
Will Mark College’s Centennial

They're not sensational though,
and most folks who have the
least bit of curiosity and have

In these war-crowded days Grinr
nell college is full of thoughts of
the present and the future, but
she hasn't entirely forgotten her
past Right now she's taking
time out to have her biography
written.

Gates hall, Macy house. Mears.
the Rand professorship symbo-
lize only a port of the rich heri-
tage of human struggle and la»
bor which built Grinnell,

In an effort to catch and hold
on the printed page this struggle
and the men who fought it, Dr.
John s. Nollen, president emeri-
tus, is writing the history of
Grinnell college. About half fin-
ished now, the book's publication
will be one of the,events mark-
ing the College's centennial.

Research for the history has
uncovered no unknown skeletons
in any of the college closets, ac<
cording to Dr. Noilen. However,
the ghast’ of one or two campus
scandals will be in the book. he
said

.been around the campus long
enough to lose an inhibition or
two have discovered them a!»
heady.

Grinnell’s history is essentially
the story of the men who built
the college. Therefore, Dr. Nol-
lcn has organized the history ac-
cording to its presidents. Dr.
.Nollen, who first came to Grin-
nell college fifty years ago has
known every president of the
college, one of his present prob-
lems is to find someone to unite
the story of his administration,
1931 to 1940.

Finally there is the story of
Jesse Macy, the Mr. Chips of
Grinnell, who pioneered in the
teaching of political science in
America. After a visit with the
Macy's their friend Lord James

in Grinnell ‘the most idyllic life
in the West."

Admission of

Negroes Here

Currenf Wdr Challenges
American Students to
Oppose Race Preiudice

A petition requesting the admis-
sion to Grinneli college of negro
students. and signed by the mem.
bers of the college postrwar semi-
nar, was presented this week to
members of the faculty by Ed
Krause, Clark junior.

Pointing out that while this
college has never denied admis~
sion to negroes, there have been
none on campus for: several years,
the petition requested faculty co»
operation In implementing it pro—
gram to bring such students to
Grinnell as soon as possible.

“In a ,war for freedom for all
peoples. we are confronted with
the challenge to act," the peti—
tion said in part. "One way to
combat the rising tide of race
prejudice is through active asso»
ciation. one contribution which
we could make, one gesture of
amity, and one expression of
good will is to get two or three
negro students for this college.”

Active solicitation for negro
students is not conducmd by the
college in the way that solicita-
tion for other students is done.
the petition pointed out.

Respectfully calling the situa<
tion to the attention of the fac-
ulty, seminar members pledged
themselves to cooper-ate in ful-
filling suitable plans the faculty
and administration may suggest.

The whole question of race re-
lationship has been one of the
prime topics of the group in dis-
cussing postrwar reconstruction.
Efforts of the group have been
concentrated on the problem for
the past two weeks. after d —
cussing it with Herbert King, d-
rector of the student.division of
the Y. M. C. A., and who ap-
peared on campus several weeks
ago.
