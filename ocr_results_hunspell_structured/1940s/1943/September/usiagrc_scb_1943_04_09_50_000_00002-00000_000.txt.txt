For Your Appoinment

Though Grlnuell and its fine col-
lege are brought into closer Con-
tact with the Army through the
Officels' Candidate School No. 2,
there are many half unanswered
questions which present them-
selvcs to the average Grinnolllan.

It must be remembered that
this school is not particularly
innit-mire of the Army in its
Inllliy ramifications. For the
most purl. the candidates
herc form u select Anny
group in um they urc all in
Gmups one or Two of the
Army general classification
(Est, wh h means that there
reticnlly they have good abili-
ty (1) loanh Before arriving
in Grinnell, they nrc ulsu sup-
posed to have shrum intrin-
sic worth hack in their old
outﬁts
For those folk, who, with the

advent of the Army school here,
expected to see infantry charges
up the main streets in the mid-
dle of the night, who wondered if
the artillery guns would boom
all over the place, who thought
that perhaps parachutists would
float from the sky with the
greatest of ea: e, who figured
that perhaps some rowdy, dowdy
rougllnecks would come to invade
this peaceful and lovcly Iowa
town. the effect must be some-
what different from what they
expected.

It has now developed and must
be remembered that this is an
Army administration school un-
der the direction of the Adjutant
General, and much of the work
concerns itself with G71 (General
Staff for the G), or personnel
work. 7

Besides this, many folks have
looked at the o. c. s. emblems
and also wondered whether a
new batch of privates were at-
tending the school. Such is not
the case. There is nothing less
than a corporal in the whole lot,
which includes three Warrant offir
crs, whose pay is more than that
of a second lieutenant, a number
of master sergeants and what
have you.

As at all 0. c S, schools. not
only in the United states but

also in England, at the Army ad-
ministration school here at Grim
nell, there are muny things pc-
culiar only to the o. c. 5. es-
tablishmenfs.

On entering the 0. C. s,
on piping comes off the hut;
all ClleVl‘Dns are removed
from the sleeve, The brass
comes off the blouse and for
a long time off the individual
limself. In the o. c. 5. school
everyone is equal, even those
outstanding privates who
were promoted to coropml, so
that they could attend ii
school,

However, the candidates still
retain their pay status; the mas-
te sergeants still get their 5138
a month, and so on down to the
$66 a month of the corpora]. The
men are generally paid the last
day of the month.
