Pro-les’r Agains'l Measure
In Iowa Senate Limiling
Japanese-American Rights

Protest against the recent Find—
lay memorial introduced to the
Iowa state senate has resulted in
two resolutions, one originating
with the board of religion in
the name of the Students, the oth<
er from the faculty.

The students resolution in op—
position to the memorial was
drawn up and signed by members
of the board of religion, approved
unanimously by the student coun-
cil, and signed by William Mc-
Keon, president of the council.

It stated, in part, “We believe
that Japanese-Americans of good
reputation should have the some
privileges afforded other Ameri—
can youth. Any attempt to re-
turn .lapanese—Ainerican students
to relocation centers constitutes
a threat to the democratic prin-
ciples for which we are fighting.

“This expression of opinion is
given in the light of our own
experience with JapaneseeAmerl-
can students of Gl‘lllnell college
where they have contributed
equally to the welfare of our col—
lege life."

The resolution from the faculty
contained, in general, the same
protest. Both have been sent [a
senators and representatives in
the Iowa state legislature, and
the latter was mailed also to
Iowa congressmen in the United
states legislature and to the pres—
ident of the United states.
