the country, and whose alumni
lead in many lines of work." In
speaking of the coeducational plan

lns'h'uc’rion Plans
Being Formula’red
By Gran’r O. Gale

The faculty has formally ap-
proved tlle recommendation
of the curriculum committee
that Grinnell college apply for
a unit of the Clvuiaii Aeronautics
program as established by the
C.A.A.

“If the application is approved,
the quota for Grinuell college will
he as gned by the CAA," Grant ‘
o. Gale, faculty adviser to Sky-
ways, stated. It is hoped that
the ground school instruction will
start at- the heginning of the
school 'year in September.
Instructor To Be Named.

“The flight instructor will be de-
signated soon so that construc—
tion of an airport and hangar in
Grinnell can get underway. He will
maintain one plane and one i-
structor for every ten students in
the course,” Gale said.

The ground school instruction
that accompanies the flying train-
ing will be given in the deparb
ment of physics.

Gustafson Comments,

Ray 0. Gustafson, copresident
of Skyways, said, "Both Robert
Hall and I were extremely happy
over the faculty action on this
question. It is distinctly a step
forward for Grinnell from the
standpoint of the students at
least. Together with the new
government training program for
pilots, the civilian Pilot Training
Program should, without a doubt,
function smoothly.

“I feel confident that once this
program is definitely established
here, Grinnell will be justly proud
of its part in such a venture.
With a faculty adviser such as
Mr. Gale, and with him instructing
our ground school, we shall have
an excellent chance of being rated
as a number one traimng unit in
this government program."

Spencer Gives
Rock Collecl'ion
To Grinnell College

Edward B. T. Spencer, professor

of Greek and archeology, has
given to Grinneil college his col-
lection of Roman rocks and man
bles, according to John M. Bridg-
ham, professor of Latin, who ac-
cepted the gifts on behalf of the
faculty.

The collection was made by
Professor Spencer during his stay
in Metodista, Rome, Italy, from
1905 to 1911. It is an extremely
well-kept collection, Professor
Bridghcm said, and is comparable
to the collection at the Univer—
sity of Michigan,

The faculty gave their approval
that the collection remain in its
present location in room 121 of
the Alumni Recitation hall, and
that a plaque, telling of the col-
lection, he put on the door of
room 121, Professor Bridgham
stated.
