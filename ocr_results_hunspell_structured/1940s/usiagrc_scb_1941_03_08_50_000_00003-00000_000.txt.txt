‘H STILL A YOUNG,

GROWING COUNTRY

 

v

Many of the nations of the Old World
had ceased to grow in material wealth
even before the war began its destruc-
tion; the density of population in many
of these lands offered little hope for
individual development.

America is more fortunate. Despite
the tremendous progress made in the
past half century, we still have the power
of young manhood, the wealth of un-
tapped resources to carry us to still
greater heights.

America will go forward, surviving all
obstacles. The American spirit: and the
American way of life will not falter
nor fail.
