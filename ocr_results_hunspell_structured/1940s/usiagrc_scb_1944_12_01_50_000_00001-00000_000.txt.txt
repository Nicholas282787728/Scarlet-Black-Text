Quill Club i'o ,
Submi’r Work
Oi Siuden‘is,

Organiza’rion Will Offer
Surrealis’r Impressions
To Naiional Magazine

Six Impressions of Georgia
O’Keefe's ‘White Skull With Pink
Rose,” a surrealist painting, were
chosen by Quill Club at a meet-
ing in Read parlor last night for
submission to Parchment national
magazine published by Quill clubs.

Those whose work was select-
ed for submission are Marie
Worth, Nancy Watts, Mary Anne
Pryor, Shirley Sawyer, Marcia
Reed and Jack Hartley.

A few weeks ago the picture
was put on display in the library,
and all members of the club were
told to study the picture, ob.
serve what it suggested to them,
and then write their impression
of the picture in the form of
prose or poetry.

These impressions were given
to Mr. Wood who brought them
to the November 17 meeting of‘
the club, and commented on the

different Word perceptions of the
picture.

According to Marcia Reed,
president, “The members are en-
joying this project very much,
and the [acuity of the English
department have taken a keen
interest in it."

Chapel Vesper Service
Tuesday From 5:00 - 5:30

A vesper service will be held in
Herrick chapel at 5:00 p. m. on
Tuesday, December 5. The pro-
gram, planned by the Board of
Religion, will consist of medita—
tion and prayer, with a back—
ground of organ music played by
Hoyle Carpenter.

The service will last about half
an hour,

 

_Explaining that embargo laws
make it impossible for the Unit-
ed States to send student aid in
the iorm of [cod and clothing,
Miss Simonton pointed out that
funds raised here will be used
primarily for books and the re-
mainder sent as cash to be used

.as the W. S. s. F, leaders abroad

see fit. This enables funds grais-
ed in other countries to he used
exclusively for food, medical aid,
and clothing. so drastically need-
ed by students abroad striving to
continue their education in strick.
cn enemyrheld countries.

Preparation by study

Miss Simonton further pointed
out that even though the total
number of students studying with
the aid of W. S. S, F. is small,
a great many of these college
juniors and seniors are key re.
sistance leaders in the under-
ground system of their countries.
Atter the rail of the French
army. most of the young men re-
turned to their colleges and un-
iversities. However, one by one
these institutions were taken
over by the German army and the
students were forced to collabor-
ate With the Nazis if they wished
to remain in school. If not, they
were told to discontinue their‘
studying or they would be sent
to work in German war indu5r
tries or held in German concen-
tration camps.

Most of these students, both
boys and girls, disappeared as
quickly and quietly as possible
and reassembled later with some
of their professors as an under:
ground unit. By continuing their
studies in this way, they feel that
they can help not only now as
underground resistance leaders,
but that they are preparing
themselves for later work as re-
construction leaders, To furth-
cr emphasize that W. S, S. F.
help is not purely personal aid.
Miss Simonton gave an illustr .
tion of 100 Chinesc students who
spend all their daylight hours
inoculating against cholera.

Miss Simonton graduated last
year in the department of soci-
ology traps the university of
Washington at Seattle, At the
present time she is taking courses
in religion at Berkeley Baptist Die
vinity School in Berkeley, Next
year she plans to do graduate
work in sociology at the univer
sity or Coliiornia, Berkeley, be-
rore going into student ‘1. w. C.

U. S, 20th Bomber Command and
came safely back to Saipan.
“Their enthusiasm for this
ﬁrst attack on Tokyo since Brig.
Gen. James H, Doolittle's token

mid on April 18, 1942, was sum-l

med up by a tormer Chicago
newspaperman when he said:
“This beats the newspaper busi-
ness!”

“Names cited here among those
who flew over Tokyo can be
added to the hero departmente
for this is a fast ball club and
it takes intestinal fortitude to
play on it,"

Corporal Peterson, whose name
was cited in this paper, is a gun-
ner on a B29.

tique furniture which is being
Iuscd for the set. “All the usable
lfurniture is absolutely authentic,”

[est piece in the set is a onedhun-

lodian, lent by Dave Sutherland,
'14, of Montezuma. some of
the tables and chairs date from
‘1865, and an antique lamp, the
‘property of the drama depart-
‘ment, is a‘ product of 1830. Most
of the costumes are copies of
garments of the period, but Lou-
