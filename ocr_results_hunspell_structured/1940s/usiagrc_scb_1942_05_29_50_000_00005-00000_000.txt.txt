Plan Three
New Maiors

Plan to Sever Lines
Belween Departments

Grimlell‘s system of majors,
changed twice in the last five
years, has been amplified and

liberalized for the third time
with the announcement of three

new ”horizontal majors" to go in-
to effect next year.

Planned to sever the lincs di-
viding departments and divisions
min either of which Grinnell stir
dents can now concentrateiand
to afford individual students an
opportunity to combine work from
several fields in preparation of
their own vocational plans, the
new system at ‘present offers ma-
jor work in general humanities.
international relations, and Amer-
ican history and literature.

chairman for the fields are
Professors Bernard N. Schilling,
Charles E. Payne, and Frederick
L. Bdumann. respectively.

The new majors in no way re-
place or nullify the regular sys-
tems of departmental or divisional
majors, the latter or which was
initiated only last year. Miss
Bethana McCandless, registrar.
termed them, “additional ﬁelds
for the convenience of students
whose interests include at least
two fields now separated by di-
visional boundsrie ,

Meanwhile, this latest move in
the modernization of Grinnclrs
departmental system was seen as
an indication of the development
of "personalized majors“, where-
by students showing good justi—
fication could plan their field oi
concentration, regardless of de»
partments included, with the aid
and consent of faculty advisers.

Details of the horizontal majors
show that five separate areas for
concentration are included in the
general humanities division alone.
