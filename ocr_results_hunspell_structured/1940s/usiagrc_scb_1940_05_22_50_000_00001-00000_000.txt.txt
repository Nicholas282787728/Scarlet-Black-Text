False Cyclone Hunt Fools No One

But Almost Kills

One clang of the bell in Magoun
hall, a few stragglers from the
dorms. most of Carney house,
multitudes of screams from the
Quadrangle, and one sprained arr
kle all add up to 1940’: first false
Cyclone hunt.

lnstigator of the hunt was an
intrepid Scarlet and Black re-
porter, who, rather than turn in
no story, went on a rampage to
create his own news.

After gaining access to the
Administration building, our prod—
igy of the Fourth Estate, gave a
few weak pulls on the bell rope.
No sound. Disgusted, he gave the
rope a mighty heave, resulting in
a mighty clang. and ending with
one stuck bell. -

A nearby rope controuing the

S &B Reporter

clapper was pulled, netting a few
half-hearted tings from the bell
above.

Up from the darkness, loomed
a black figure. Out of the window
went the news hound, landing on
a cement block, nearly spraining
an ankle. and bouncing into the
arms of a waiting night watch-
man.

The entire episode was wit»
nessed by Jerry Fort, who said he
was beaten to the task. and an—
other Macyite, Lewis "Doc” Rites,
and several other Smithmen,
whose names we can't remember.
John McCune would have been
there except someone said he had
gone over to the Quad with a
blanket to get his girl when she
came out on the Cyclone hunt.

Local Inventor
Dreams Up New
Hydraulic Bullet

An hydraulic bullet, planned to
increase the firing power of a
powder charge, has been designed
by Harold S. Hockett. an em-
ployee of the Grinnell Metal Plat-
ing company in Crinnell.

In the proposed bullet, a gela-
tin capsule filled with oil is to be
inserted between the powder
charge and the lead pellet. The
powder, when exploded, forces the
oil to occupy a smaller space,
thus creating hydraulic compres-
sion, which would be many times
greater than the original force of
the charge. The action of the
compressed oil would be much
like the kick of a steel spring
when released.

In addition to the hydraulic
force, some Dcisel action might
‘be created in the chamber by ex-
ploding the oil in the capsule.
Hockett pointed out that the pow»
er generated by firing oil is much
greater than that of gasoline and
powder.

Preliminary designs have been
sent to the War Department by
Hochett, and a letter confirming
the acceptance of the plans has
been received by the Assistant to
the Adjutant General. According
to Hocket, this message informed
him that the department would
be working on the idea, and
would let him know what results
were obtained within a reasonable
length of time.
