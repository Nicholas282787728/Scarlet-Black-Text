Getting Your Money's
Worth - -

A few weeks ago the Student Council con-
ducted a poll to determine how the‘ se-
mester fee money should be distributed.
At the time only about one-third of the
student body voted, but the council believed
it was a fairly good estimate of what
organizations on campus should receive the
most money.

Easily receiving the largest number of
votes in the poll was the music and lec—
ture series, and the Student Council appor-
tioned the money accordingly. Yet through-
out the current series of programs, the
college attendance has been not only poor,
but actually so small as to raise the ques—
tion, is it worth it? Does it pay to spend
money for talented artists like $00 Yong
and Anne Brown when so few students
actually attend the performances?

Cel’tainly the small attendance is not
due to a poor choice of performers. Soo
Yong is an internationally famous actress,
and Anne Brown has achieved fame in the
music world. Those few who did attend
these programs praise the quality and our
tertainment value of both performances.-

We are not saying that it is embar-
rassing for the performers to play to such
small audiences, because that is not true.
Town people and faculty members and their
families along with a smattering of college
students, usually fill the auditorium The
great majority of students who have helped
to pay for the programs and who would
be admitted free are absent.

 

, The college takes such pains to acquire

high-grade performers, not only to give
students attending this college a chance
to appreciate and evaluate artists in their
various fields, but to aid development in
understanding and appreciating the fine
arts, which is actually an objective of the
college and a requirement for graduation.

We can conclude, then, that «poor at-
tendance at music and lecture programs is‘
not the fault of those who choose the type
of programs, nor the quality of the enter-
tainers, but that the fault rests with tlle'
student body. Those who supplant the col,
lege sponsored programs with a movie are
not only robbing themselves of an oppor—
tunity for cultural development, but are
not getting their money‘s worth out of
their semester fee.

Time, Please? - -

Anyone who tries to tell you that there
are only five time belts in the United
States is obviously misinformed. He has
left out the sixth belt: Grinnell college;
time, There is no clock on the college came
pus which agrees with any town clock or1
with the radio. To be more specific, there
is no clock on the campus which agrees
with any other clock anywhere. The ques-
tion, “What time is it?" is purely rhetorical
at Grinnell college.

Freshmen are always confused in this
issue. They are amazed at having disco)?-
ered the only place in the world where one:
can leave for class at fifteen minutes tol
eight, take five minutes to get there, ondl
arrive in the classroom at 8:05. More as-
tounding yet, one can leave the library at
ten o’clock and get to class at 9:50. And
he does not even have to run.

In connection with time, there are
three types of professors here. There is
type one who becomes sullen or sarcastic
if anyone is a half minute late. Type two
is injured and righteously indignant if any-
one expects him to be on time. Finally, we
have type three who absolutely ingnores
any kind of time. This last type is the
only kind of person who has\ any right to

his attitude in a school where the library

clock says 8:15, the ARH clock 8:05, the
Main clock 7:55, and the Meals clock eight
o‘clock—simultaneously.

One solution for our problem is to ap-‘

point a central time piece according to
which others will be regulated. Many of
us, too, would like to hear the McGoon
Hall bell ring for classes again. But if
these things cannot be done, why not just
forget time entirely? Let’s make Grinnell
the first timeless college in the world. We
have a fine start.
