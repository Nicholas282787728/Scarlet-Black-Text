In the Near Fu+ure - -

With less than a month remaining be-
fore the election of the Student Council
president for next year we are all listening
for the first whirs indicating that the
campus political machines are warming up.
Preceding elections have all had distinctive
campaign surprises and our private oracle
forecasts that this election will be no ex,
ception.

‘ Reverting to a well»known subject, this
is ,war; so once again we will expect the
women to play the dominant role~which
presents a problem. In the last two elcc-
tions we have noticed that certain typically
feminine qualities have seriously jeopard-
ized the chances of the election meaning a
good time for all. Petty criticisms have
been brought to bear upon candidates.
Open campaigning has been frowned upon,
As a result the candidates are almost ex—
pected to keep themselves hidden from the
public eye during the campaign and show
not the slightest flicker of interest in the
proceedings.

There are some of us who still recall
with nostalgia all era of real power politics
on the campus, and era of extravagant, in-
genius campaigns. The election period was
and still should be the most exciting time
of the year,

The junior class of this year is so small
that we are able to know all of them in,
timately; and for this reason, it may be
hard to make a choice not based on per-

' sonal feelings. Our choice should be made
on the basis of careful analysis of qualifi-
cations. Having made our choice, it may
be difficult for us to declare our affilia-
tions when intimate friends are opposing
candidates. It is important to choose the
right candidate, but it is not a matter worth
the destruction of friendships. Remember
the candidates may be good-spiritedly ope
posing their friends IS there a reason
why their supporters shouldn’t participate
in the contest ill the same amicable fashion?

Let’s begin our consideration of can—
didates now and when the opening of the
campaign is announced, let’s do our part
with determination to see a wellequalif'led
person win, and at the same time resolve
to make the election of 1945 one which will
be remembered for many years to come.

Have You Got +he Time? - -

The headwaitress gave the signal that the
students could leave the dining room. Out
of the ten girls at one table, who immed-
iately rushed for the door, only two
stopped long enough to push their chairs in

This is only one e ampleiand a minorl
one, at thatiof the inexpressibly poor
manners that are being exhibited on cam-
pus. It seems incredible that college stud-
ents should have to be reminded of such
a thing as politeness. Surely all of us were
taught the rudiments of civilized behavior
at an early age, and by this time we should
have perfected our store of knowledge on
the subject sufficiently to be able to con-
duct ourselves as ladies and gentlemen.
But, as is quite evident, we haven’t. A
sampling of Emily Post, even a brief r —
view, might do wonders to remedy the sit-
uation. ,

The attitude of the majority of the
students seems to be that of not having
the time. Two or three girls walking
abreast down the street never bother to
move for the poor unfortunate approaching
them; he, or she, as the case may be,
simply has‘l to wade into a snow drift or
be pushed into it,

The student who bravely attempts the
struggle out of the bookstore in the morn-
illg usually gives up in despair. Those
rushing down to get their mail seem 0b-|
livious of the fact that the stairs were in—
tended for those wishing to go up, too.
Would a white lille down the middle of the
stairs solve the difficulty—we wonder.
These are not isolated cases, unfortunately.
They are typical, to be seen anywhere and
at any time. ~ l

of the rudeness, or thoughtlessuess on
the part of Grinnelliansiand we hope it is
tlloughtlessness—the most conspicuous ex»
ample is the student who squeezes into the
dining room line without waiting his turn.
We know you’re hungry, we’re hungry too
——and we also have to review our history
before going to class. Think about the other
fellow for a change. You don’t like it when,
you stand in line and watch others shoving;
in ahead, so you ought to know how he;
feels when you do that very thing. If each
individual would wait his turn, the line
would move swiftly and no one would have
to stand long. So how about giving it a
try?

In former years, dinner was a rather
But if the upperclassmcn
‘emember their etiquette, they aren’t show-
ing it; and if the freshmen were taught
our table rules and regulations, they for-
got to remember them. Food should always
be passed to the head of the table first
Dessert should not be eaten until the person
at the head begins. The table head should
accept his responsibility and see that these
rules are followed.

Good manners are the basic element of
society. They can be forgotten easily if
they are not practiced. We’re all busy, we
all seem to have more to do right now than
ever before; but there‘s always time to be
polite. It takes such little effort, yet it
makes a lasting impression. i

Correcting the present situation can't‘
be done without the cooperation of every-
one. So how about youihave you got the
time?

"Home Away - -

Housekeepers' Mo‘l’ro

By Stuart Reader

As you plowed through the log-
gla, snbwdrms to your early
lnol'nlng breakfast, did you won-
der why in the h - . . they
hadn’t put the loggic storm wine
claws up? As you shivered your
way to lunch and dinner, did you
wonder why in the h , . , they
hadn’t put the loggia storm win-
dows up? And‘finally, as you
lay in the infirmary coughing
and sneezing and choking over
technicolored health capsules, did
you wonder why in the h - - »
they hadn't put the loggia, storm
\vmdows‘ up?

NO, it wasn't because they
wanted you to enjoy an invigor»
sung walk from Read to Main.
No, it Wasn’t because they want
ed in all the lnfll‘mary and incu-
bate mumps. And, no, it wasn't
because there weren‘t any: storm
Windows They just didn't ‘have
anyone to put them up.

All or which brings us to that
department or the college which

At present the housekeeping
department has no great prob-

ials are off the market, says Mrs.
Ferguson,

When the army units come 'to
Grinncll, the college was able to
get a new supply at towels and
sheets which should hold the col-
lege for another year without
replacement.

Pet peeve of the department,
according to Mrs. Ferguson, are
cats and dogs. (Herman’s free-
dom on campus has been cur-
huled so that he can no longer
attend classes in Ann.)

Just as the manpower short-
age hindered the department's
performance of its customary due
ties this winter, so will it hinder
spring housecleaning. Every year
dul‘lng spring vacation all four

on campus are washed, and they
are washed again in the fall.
