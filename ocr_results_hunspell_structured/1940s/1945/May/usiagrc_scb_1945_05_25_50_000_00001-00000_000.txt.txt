Origin of Prizes

The Hill prizes originated in
1391 when Dr. Gershom H. Hill,v
of Des Moines, and the Rev. Mr.
James L. Hill, Salem, Mass, es-
tablished the prizes in commem-
oration of the twentieth anniver-
sary of their graduation which
had taken place in 1871. These
prizes were. as far as is known,
the first of their kind in the
country.

The purpose behind the speech
contest is achievement of excels
lence in extemporaneous ezhorto—
tion and persuasion. The prizes
are awarded on the basis of an—
dience vote on the various con-
testants.
