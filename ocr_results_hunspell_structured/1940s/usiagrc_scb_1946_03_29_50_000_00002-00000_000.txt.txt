Pilgrimage - -

The college guest strolled toward the

campus that he remembered and loved so
well. There was the old Ad building, its
lines softened by ivy. There was Blair,
where he had just barely eased through
chemistry . . . it had been rough, but he’d
made it. There was the quad, where one
fine night he’d called for Helen for their
first date. The old place sure. held a lot of
memorles.

Suddenly the guests reflections were
broken. Down the street came four stal»
wart lads, fine examples of cleanrcut Ameri-
can manhood. As they approached, the
guest noted with pride the books under
their arms, the laughter in their eyes . . .
and then they pushed him off the sidewalk.

He gathered his dignity, picked up his

Two pretty coeds were coming toward
him. One looked a lot like his teen-age
daughter. He nodded and said hello. One
girl tittered, and the one that looked like
young Helen nodded carelessly. They chat»
tel-ed on, and the old grad began to feel a
little unwelcome.

As the day went on, the guest began to
feel less alld less like a gllest and more and
more like all interloper. This wasn’t the

he tripped over. two half—nude girls suns
bathing in front of the quad. When, in the
course of the day, he had occasion to .Visit

that the kidifor that’s all he wasiwho was ,

get up. If his Son acted like that, he’d
certainly hear about it.

to choke. Even before it was time to leave

would put it when she scolded the kids for
the Same thing. Then people Started leav-
ing the room. The guest was mulled, pulled,-

He took the 9:45 out that night. Helen
wasn’t expecting him so soon, but he guess»

home tomorrow. She met him, [when he

“How was it, Fred? Did you See all the

and have a good time?” she asked.

“It was all right dear. I’m pretty tired,
I'll tell you all about it later," But he
wouldn’t. Helen was pretty sentimental
about Gl-innell. He would let the subject
