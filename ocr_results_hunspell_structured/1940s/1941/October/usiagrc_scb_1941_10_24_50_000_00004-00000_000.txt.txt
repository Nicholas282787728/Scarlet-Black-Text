Pioneers Practice Passing
For Cornell Game Tomorrow

McCartney and
Waters Handle

Receiving End

Forward passing drills were
the order of the week as
the Pioneers prepared for the
Cornell game tomorrow. Ed
Nagers return to the hackfieid
made pitching prospects hrigllter,
Both Murray Richards and Don
Hippie shared the passing duties
with Nagel.

Harry Waters continued to look
better as a receiver. while Hugh
McCartney was doing his share of
the catching. Lefty Sory, the
Pioneers most consistent pass
catcher, did not report for prac-
tice last night. He is nursing an
injured leg. Tod Kennefick is
hack in uniform, however, and
will he ready for contact work
next week.

Against the preps last night the
varsity pass defense was sharp,
and the yearlings had trouble
making any completions.

In last night's drill Virgil Rees,
reserve quarterhack, sutfered
what was believed to be a ruptur-
ed spleen.

Injuries to key Cornell linemen,
however, raised Pioneer hopes for
spoiling the Purple: homecoming
tomorrow.

Wait Haloupek, star wingman.
suffered a badly bruised shoulder
in the Coe game and has avoided
contact work this week. Rudy
rBodicka, Cornell center, has been
out most of the week with a.
charlcy horse. It is doubtful that
either will see much action
against the Pioneers.

By virtue of their performances
this week, Coach Ben Douglas
plans the following lineup;

Waters and McCartney, ends:
Grant and Bishop, tackles; Gonias
and Bredimus. guards; DeWiLt,
center; in the backfield spots will
be .iekcl, Hippie, Nagel, and
either McGi-ane or Gruening at
the tailback post.
