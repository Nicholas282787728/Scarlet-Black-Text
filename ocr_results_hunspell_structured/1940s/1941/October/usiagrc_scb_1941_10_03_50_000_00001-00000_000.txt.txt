lns’rruclionTo Be Free
In Cello. Violin, Harp,
Horns, And Woodwinds

Free music classes for ins
strllmental groups will be or—
ganized next week, according
to J. Forrest West, head of
the mllsic department.

Any student may participate, he
said, and the course, if taken four
consecutive semesters, will give
four hours credit. Taken in short-
er periods, the classes are regard~
ed as extra-curricular activities,
West said.

Fee for Vince

Instruction will be given in
piano, harp, violin, cello, viola,
voice, the woodwind instrumental
class which includes clarinets and
saxophones, and the brass class of
trumpets and other brass instru-
ments

The piano and voice classes will
require a fee, about one-fourth
the cost of private lessons, ac-
cording to West, other classes
will be free.

Hours To Be Arranged

Hours will be arranged as stud-
ents desire, with a probable en—
rollment of four in each class.
West stated that there will be as
many classes for each instrument
as registration demands.

“We are especially interested in
violin and viola students this
year," he commented. "In re~
gard to instruments, a limited
number of all kinds are available
for rental at $1 per month."

The classes are designed for
beginners, but advanced classes
will be formed if there is enough
demand, West said.

Tenativc plans for incorporating
rifle shooting into the accredited
intramural program were discuss-
ed at a meeting of the Rifle club
in Clark hall club room last night,
according to Herschel M. Colbert,
faculty adviser of the group.

To set up the proposed rifle
shooting plan, National Rifle as-
sociation regulations will be ads
hered to, Colbert said.

Must Cross Hurdles

He was emphatic, however, in
pointing out that the club’s pro-
gram was merely in the form<
ative stages, and that several
hurdles would have to be cross—
ed before the plan could be put
in operation. Approval of the
physical education department
and the curriculum committee
would be necessary, he said.

The tenative plan as drawn up
last night lists seven divisions of
proposed superwsed instruction.
These are: the study of range
safety rules, nomenclature, the
care and cleaning of firearms,
actual shooting technique, firing
positions and the use of the sling,
range firing practice. and record—
ed firing as an achievement test.
