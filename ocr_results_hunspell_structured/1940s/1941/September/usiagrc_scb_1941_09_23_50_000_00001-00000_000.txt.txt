Cul Sys’rem
Changes Lisi'ed
By McCandlpss

The old “out" system“ is out, ac-
cording to Bethana McCandless,
registrar. Previously, all students
have been allowed nine to four-
teen unexcused absences each
semester with triple—cut penal-
ties for classes missed before and
after vacations.

Beginning this semester stud~
euts will receive a five dollar
fine for each class missed before
and after vacations, and consis-
tent recorded absences will
bring a student’s name before the
curriculum committee.

This year no freshman, first
semester sophomore, or upper-
classman whose grade point aver-
age is below 1.5 will be allowed
to miss a class without an ex-
cuse “from his dean, Upperclass
men whose average is above 1.5
may have unexcused absences acA
cording to the allowances of
their instructors.

 

Stevens Estimates Slight Decrease
In Grinnell Enrollment This Year

With official enrollment re-
turns not yet reported, ad-
ministrative opinion predicts
a slight lowering in the num—
ber of students at Grinnell
during the year 1941-42.

“My guess is that there will be
about 700 or 720 students here
this year, as opposed to 746 last
fall,” Pres, Samuel N. Stevens
stated,

Stevens pointed out that this
estimate was only a guess, and
that there was a distinct possi-
bility that the figures would show
a great variation from his own
estimate. More than 53 students
who were enrolled last year are
detmitcly not returning; the pres
ident stated.

Of this number, more than 20
were dropped because of poor
scholarship; 12 transcript rec—
ords have been forwarded to oth-
er schools; six men and three
women were requested not to re-
turn this fall because of poor
conduct; and 15 men were lost be-
cause of the drait law,

According to figures in the ad-
missions department, the size of
this year's freshman class was
25 short of figures a year ago,
Stevens said. This estimate was
calculated at the latter part of
last week, the president pointed
out, and since that time has un~
doubtedly changed.
