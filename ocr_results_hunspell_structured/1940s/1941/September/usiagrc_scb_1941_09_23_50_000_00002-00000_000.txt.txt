But when cities multiplied and new in-

was content to rest on lullrels earned in
the past. With all due deference to the men
who struggled valiantly in the postwar
years to keep Grinnell’s star in the ascens

moved in to undermine the Grinnell spirit
of old. Whether the blame should be plac-

O A Challenge.

Tomorrow when classes take up for
academic year of 1941-42. a new era in
Education at Grinnell will begin.
Grinnell is pioneering in the educational

field.

The situation is comparable to that of
a century ago when the original “Iowa
Band” invaded the wildemess of Iowa and
bravely began a college in the midst of a
raw, primitive community. That was the

true beginning of Grinnell.

And that Grinnell has accomplished many
things during the years when the United
States grew up around it. A reputation
of gameness, of comradeship, known famil-
iarly as “the Grinnell spirit,” grew up from

tion, no—one can say. Few deny that Grin-
nell has been doing little more in the last
fifteen years than grimly holding its own.
As every institution must have its ups and
downs. Grinllell has been in a slump.

The new educational system which will

plainly visible evidence of this turn for the
better, one has only to gaze at the Coil'les
rising on the north campus—the

st building construction undertaken at
Glinnell in the last tnenty five years.

The saga of Grinnell by no means has
been completed. We are enteling another
period of great promise.

As

Whether this

promise bears fruit depends in equal meas-

he was a freshman here. “I was
ill-clothed, ill-mannered, and gen-
erally in the dark." he said. “I
wanted dates, and didn't know
how to go about getting them."

It was when Gansert discussed
the problem with stoli that Poss—
ibilities Unlimited began to take
shape. Plans were first present-
ed before the administration last
spring, and this year they have
come into actual being.

A similar organization was in-
stituted last year over in the
Quadrangle, ~when a group of co-
eds organised to perform menial
tasks for an errant coed. The
coed had been fincd by the
League Board. and the income
received was used to pay the
fine.

Around
The Campus

With
BILL 3110an

It is with a distinct feeling
of regret that we note that
Lang-an hall has been turned
into an almost exclusive
freshman hall, with other
halls suffering from the
smaller quota of freshmen.
The plans for the new
Cowles dormitory, as we
heard them, also called for

lire upon continued wisdom of administra-
tion and a student body anxious to con
operate in a great adventure. Let lls re-
mould “the Grinnell spirit” into a new,
streamlined, twentieth-century model.

making that building a fresh-
men residence.
We object.

The freshmen now residing in
Langan will be deprived of all
feeling of comradcship when they
move into other halls. They will
miss out on the feeling of unity
that nine or ten preps attain
when pitted against forty upper-
classmen. The comradeship gain-
ed during Hell Week is some—
thing that is nsver repeated in
the remaining years of college.

The Council of House Presi—
dents, which we believe holds
some faith in hall loyalties,
should take stcps to stop this
trend, and put Iangan hack on
its feet as a "normal” hall.

othcrivisc the dorms become
a. transient mass of humasuty
like the Quadrangle.

Great steps towards rais—
ing the esteem of Grinnell ill
the minds of the student
body was accomplished with
the guillotining of the for»
mal cut system, and the
establishment of 12 o’clock
hours every Saturday night
at the Quadrangle.

Now that the real effect of
cutting is in the hands of the
professors instead of the loss of
an hour's credit, incentive to see
how many cuts a student can
take will be done away with. And
no more will a student be kept
from graduation because he took
one out too many. That is all
good.
