The starting lineup for coe
features as good a team, If not
better, than they had last year.
At the forward positions there
are Dave (Cowboy) Connell and
Paul Tschirgi, veterans, who ,‘are
good for at least ten points in any
game. Hank Moss, second high in
the conference scoring, Will start
at the center position Moss is
probably the most consistent
scorer on the Crimson and Gold
five. and will be the big man to
stop in Lumght's clash. Captain
Don Dunlap and his brother. Bob,
will start at guru-d positions. All
of these men except Connell
played against Gi-iiinell last year.
High points to be noticed in me
game are Tschlrgi's deadly one-
handed shooting and Connell’s
brilliant passing, which have been
featured all through the season.
Patterson Boosts Pioneers.

Grinnell's chances of winning
this contest have been bolstererl
this past week by the return or
high-scoring forward, PaulPatterr
son. His sharp eye for the basket
has given the Pioneers that much
needed extra score in many games
this year. with Patterson in the
scoring column we also have Co-
captains Jerry Fort and Gene

Peislier. Both of these men have
had some trouble in finding their
eye at times. but should be able
to hit tonight. Harold “Hap" Ken-
dall. veteran guard. failed to
make his usual some in Monday
night’s game With Monmouth, but
his ”off” nights are not frequent
and he can probably be counted
on for his share of the scoring.
iiohuwks Use Fast-Break.

Not oniy are the Pioneers find»
ing that they are going to have
to rack up a number ot points to
whip this Coe outfit. but also that
it’s going to take superior guard
and defense concentration to keep
the Kohawk’s test-hieak under
control. From the reports of Coe
opposition, thc best-woy to keep
them from scoring is to keep them
from getting in close to the has-
ket.
