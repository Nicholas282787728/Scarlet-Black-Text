English Rely On
U. S. Intervention
To Beat Germany

By William O. Ell-11:.—

Just what long-Jawed Harry Hop»
kins discovered on his fourrweek
Junltet to the British isles is like-
ly to remain official hush-stuff
for some time to come. But it
would surprise this commentator
but a little if Franklin's pal dis-
covered that Great Britain holds
little hope of a complete victory
Without active American 'pﬂl‘ticr
pation in the conflict,

For, ivieiinng the situation as ii
can be analyzed from the infor-
mation ava' bit, it appears that,
only one factor is capableoi sav-
ing John Bull from ei her stale-
mate or inglorious defeat: THE
COMPETENT ARMED FORCE
OF THE UNITED‘ STATES Ant]
that conclusion stems from the
following reasons.

t1) The British shipping plop
ture is rapidly becoming desper-
ate. Because the British navy is
necessarily spread thin ovcrEuro-
pean and Asiatic wateis. but a
limited number of destroyers anti
light cruiscrs are available toi-
convoy duty in the Atlantic. 13c-

Ca‘llSE of this shortage, convoys

due to the unwieldiness of such
concentration as well as the iii.
adequate protection available,
these monthly convoys present an
increasingly easy target for Nazi

It has been the hope of many
that the Brownshii-ts could he

New Trampolene
To Be Exhibited

A Tranipolciic, a new inovation
in gymnastic equipment, will he
demonstrated between the halves
of the Grinnell-Coe basketball
game tonight, The exhibition will
be staged by Irwin Simone and
Lynn Schlotterbeck, Grinnell high
school assistant coach.

The new gymnasium device was
invented by a former University
of lowa gymnast. It consists of
an oblong piece of canvas about
6x12 feet, attached to a heavy
‘pipc frame by dozens of coil
springs. Folding supports hold

the canvas about three feet from ,

the floor, and the s - gs give
the surface enough resilience that
a person may catapault himself
eight or 10 feet in the air.
