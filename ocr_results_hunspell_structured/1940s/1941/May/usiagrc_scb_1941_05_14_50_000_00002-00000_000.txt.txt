Q It Is Still April?

Grillnell Commissary
Grinnell College
Grinnell, Iowa.

Dear Commissary:

In these days 01' national defense when
every shoulder should be at the wheel,
when every nose must be at the grindstone,
when every heart must think "America
First,” what have you done to further the
cause of patriotism? Is everything being
accomplished that will make us think
“America is a great nation" every time we
sit down to lunch and dinner? We don’t

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

believe so.

Ice tea is a wonderful drink. It is also
an American drink. In no other nation in
the world do the ctiizens mix tea and ice,
tossing in a little lemon and sugar on the
side. Ice tea is refreshing. It cools one off.
It makes one happy. It makes one apple
ciatc the great nation in which we live.

Why don’t you do your hit to further the
cause for national defense?

We Who Pay Board.

0 Drama Department’s Dilemma

The Department 01' Drama was “put on
the spot” recently by the administration
when the commencement play was scheduled
for Friday instead of Saturday night, as
has been the custom in recent yeals.

The drama dep' 'tment " dependent on
income received lom this production to
carry on much of its work during the com-
ing Year. With acut ill much-needed revenue,
it “1] be more difficult than ever to stage
plays that reach the Grinnell standard,

A Friday night show would mean a cut
in revenue because the majority 01' visitors
do not arrive on the campus for commence
mcnt until Saturda. With the production
to be the original one-act plays (being me
sented next Monday night) both students
and tonnspeople will not be in attendance
graduation weekend. Therefore the actors
would be playing before an empty house.

A belief holds that the play would run
in competition with the Senior Prom, to
take place the same evening: Certainly, a
different type of people will be attending
both events And it will not be impossible
for those who wish to attend both to do so.

The administration, when acquainted with
the full details of the situation, should make
the change in dates. The Scarlet and Black
thinks they will do so.
