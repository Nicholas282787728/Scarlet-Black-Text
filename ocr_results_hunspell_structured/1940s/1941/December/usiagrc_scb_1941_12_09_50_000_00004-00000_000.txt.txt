should and can do. It
would be unwise to act
recklessly and thought-
lessly now, before the
government has given
us the direction in
which we should move.
Representatives of the

college are being sent to
many onportant meetings in

month to secure from head-
quartci-s reliable information
and guidance as to what
will be required of us in-
stitutionally and individual-
ly. Until all the facts are in

Samuel N. Stevens,
Pres, Gl'innell College

The C. A. A. program at Crin-
nell is suspended but there is a
very good possibility that it will
be reinstated within a Short time,
Glenn Neiderhauser, owner of the
Grinneil Airport, and head of the
c. A. A. program at Grinnell, an-
nounced today.

There is also every reason to
expect that private pilots will be
reinstated after a complete ex<
emination of each individual’s rec.
ord and history, Neiderhauser
said.

The C. A. A. instructors are to
go to Des Moines soon to be re-
instated, as the same examination
Will pertain to them, Neiderhausex‘
added.

He advised students who now
hold licenses, which expire in the
near future, to go ahead and
make application 'for new licenses
and to take the physical examin-
ation as though nothing had hap-
pened.
