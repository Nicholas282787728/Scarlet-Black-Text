C ymbol—Banging Swing Addict Held
Responsible for Dibble-Clark War

Heralded by dripping water and
tinkling glass, the Clark-Dibble
feud arose from the grave over
examination period to flaunt it»
self, now a mere skeletop, before
the dean's office.

Authorities are in doubt regard—
ing the actual cause of hostilities
Peace, or a reasonable facsmile
thereof, has existed between the
two domitories since October
1539, when an ultimatum from
Dean Shelton L. Beatty forced
a stalemate

To date, neither hall has ap—
plied for honors as being the
aggressor. Rumors circulating
around Dibble hold that repeated
attempui to steal the Eagle, long
the symbol of the Northenders,
might be responsible.

Generalissimo Jack Reynolds of
the Clark forces was prompt to

blame Dibble, laying the guilt
on Dibble's Bates Hall who is
said to be something of a swing
addict. Said Reynolds, “He just
sits in the room and bangs cym—
bols all day long. It's driving us
batty," ,

Reynolds was assisted in the
campaign by several Clark fresh—
men, who were drafted iuto serr
vice. Fred Webb, noted athlete
and Dibble resident, served as
Field Marshall for the North-
enders.

casulties are slight, with Dibble
boasting several broken windows.
Several men in both halls were
recipients of buckets of water.

A truce was called the early
part of this week when warm
ings from both house presidents
brought forth the white dove of
peace.
