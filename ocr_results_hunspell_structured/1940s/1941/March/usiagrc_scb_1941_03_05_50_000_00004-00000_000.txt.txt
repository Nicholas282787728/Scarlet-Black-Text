THRU THE

too?

By Jack Wile.

Returning at down this morning
from a three»geme trip to Wis-
cousin and Illinois, the basketball
team was greeted by a crowd of
400 students as enthusiastic as
the one that started them on their
way last Friday. All this. despite
the feet that the Pioneers only
won one game in three. Needless
to say, the cagers were very
much surprised. But even though
they did come out on the short
end of the deal, the student body
can afford. to be proud of the
co-champions of the Midwest coli-
{chance

The basis for this pride is
the fight they put up in wine
lling that necessary ,victoi
from Lawrence college Saturn
day night, Wisconsin fans
who have been following the
Lawrence team said that
they had their hottest night
of the season when they play»
ed Grinnell. It took all of the
stuff the Pioneers had to
come out on top of the fray.

"he Ripon loss was one 01 those
things that happen to teams pla 4-
ing away from home. We can't
say that them was a bad job
of refereeing, because it was much
better than We're used to seeing
down here, As a. matter of fact,

that was the whole trouble in n'

nutshell, nlpon made 15 free
throws in that game, more than
enough to give them the advan-
tage. The Pioneers weren‘t hitting
on their charity tries, Ripon was.
Prooi of the hnporoonoe oi the
free throws is seen in the fact
that Grhlnell mme 17 ﬁeld goals
that night. While Ripon mode
