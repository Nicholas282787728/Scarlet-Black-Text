Phelps Es‘lima’res
Hampion Es’rai'e
Less Than $I0,000

The estate of Dr. Frederick W.
Houghton, which was willed to
Grinnell college, will probably
amount to less than $10,0uu, ac-
cording to Li vi Phelps, college
treasurer. Dr. Houghton died last
month in council Bluffs.

This figure, estimated as that
and expenses are paid, is to be
placed in a trust fund and admin-
istered by the college trustees. 1n-
terest from the fund will be used
for loans to students.

Dr. Houghton, who was not
a Grinnell alumni, willed his
estate as he did because he
believed that this type of in-
vestment in young people is one
of the best possible ways to use
money, Phelps said,

“It is significant that he chose
to leave his small estate to Grin-
nell in order that one of his in-
terests might continue after his
death," Phelps pointed out.
