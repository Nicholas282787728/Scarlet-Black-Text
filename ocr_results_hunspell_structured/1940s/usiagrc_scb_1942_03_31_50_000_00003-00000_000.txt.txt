Advisors Seen As

Twenty Instructors
Members Discuss
Freshman Problems

The spirit of studelitrfaculty re—
lations of years ago, when regis—
tration was done by the president
in his own office, has been reviv.
ed. at Grinnell.

A faculty counseling system,
established by Pre’s. Samuel N.
Stevens, provides that 20 mem-
bers of the faculty each have 12
new students with whom they
hold informal conferences every
two weeks. Personal and acad-
emic development is discussed.

The counsellors meet among
themselves to plan the special
content of their interviews on
such subjects as individual habits
of study, the improvement of read
ing skills, the use of the library,
and limited participation in activ-
ities of the campus.

During New Student days, last
semester all new students took
numerous tests, results of which
the counsellors studied before
registering their students.

Included in the tests were vo~
cational preferences, achievements
in their high school studies, vo-
cabulary, reading skills. an in-
ventory of study habits, and their
general aptitude for college work.

The personnel program of the
college is in charge of D. Henry

petition has 150 glee club entrees
from 44 states over the union.

time as well as the fundamental
problems of consumer education,
Mary Ellen Appleby, publicity
chairman, said last night,

Schedule for the day includes a
chapel speech by Dr, Blake at
10 a. m. Friday morning. with
round table discussions and small
forum groups at 11 a. m., and
1:30 and 3:00 in the afternoon.

ing room at 4:15 p. m. and a din-
ner honoring Dr, Blake is plan-
ned for 6:15 p. m.

Grinnell students may have
charge of one of the round tables
during the day. Members of the
student speaker committee of
the Wartime Service Bureau have
been asked to prepare a forum on
college problems during war. Rep-

ing the conference will participate
on the panel, Miss Applcby said.

delegates from distant schools is

rooms for delegates remaining un-
til Saturday, and will be in
charge of meal tickets and regis-
