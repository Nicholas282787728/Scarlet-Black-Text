GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Art Werlein to Lead
Beahawks at Newton

 

There are a lot of angles to
the game the Pioneers will
be playing Friday night with
the Iowa City Pie—flight

school’s Bealiziwks.

For one thing, both teams will
be fighting for their ﬁrst win
this season. The Scarlet and
Black has accumulated more than
experience and injuries from its
first three games, and the Bear
hawks failed to register any kind
of a score against their two ope
ponents, Case and Carleton.

Second, starting lineups for
both teams have changed consid—
erably since the first game of
the season. Glinnell has had to
make the changes because of in-
juries whilc the Beahawks have
been searching for a scoring Come
bination. Another factor in the
Prerﬂight situation is the con-
stant turnover in the squad of
the Iowa City team as new men
enter the school and older cadets
leave.

And thirdly, the Iowa City
team’s captain in next Fri-
day's game at Newton play-
ed center on the Pioneer's
outlit last season,

Some game !

A new Grinllell backfield line—
up Will face the Bealiawks Fri-
day, when Coach Ben Douglas
will probably send in Harry Web
ers, blond first string end, to re-
place Jack McCrane at half
back.

MeGi-ane suffered a shoulder
separation and'a painful tongue
injury in last week's game with
Knox which will keep him out
of play for several weeks.

\At Water's place at end, Dougr
la: is planning to start six foot
three, 197 pound Bob Corrigaii.

Bruiiie Vanstrnm, reserve end,
who suffered a broken finger
some time ago, is back at the
job and may see some service in
the Newton game.

“We’re at the point now where
the boys want to win a ball
game," said Assistant coach Les
Duke today.

Duke also announced tliat'a
special section is being reserved
for Griunell students in the grand-
stand at Newton, and that any
student who can {aid transporta-
tion to Newton will be able to
see the game on their sem fee
tickets.

Nor’rh Read Goes
Down Once More

Rawson, fully equipped with
crowd, yells, waterboys and team,
defeated North Read, 2470, Mon-
day. The North Read boys, right-
ing hard, played well, and if Don
Johnson of diawson had been cov-
ered better, the game would have
been close.

Collins in the backfield and
shoddy iii the line played good
defensive games for North Read,
while smith, Johnson, and Kab-
erle were offensive threats for
Rawson and Mcacham was strong
in the line,
