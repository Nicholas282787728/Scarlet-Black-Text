For The Lesi- Time. '30 - -

We‘ve thought about it all year, and in the
last few weeks more often, wondering what
it would be like putting out the last issue
of the S. & B., realizing that never again
would we assign a headline for the college
paper, hound Prescott to locate a cut that
just isn’t there, or worry about assign-
ments that aren‘t in. And now so soon
it‘s here i , the last night on the S. & B.

An editorial should be an expression
of opinion on a subject of general interest,
concisely reported and acutely analyzed.
Well, this editorial is an expression of
opinion from the class of 1945, but sentie
mentality cannot easily be analyzed. So
for just this once we’re going to discard
all the rules of journalism and follow our
nostalgic inclinations. Sitting in the smoky,
noisy atmosphere of the office, crowded
with memories of four wonderful years, is
hardly conducive to logical thinking on a

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

night such as this.

In just two more days we’ll walk up
to the platform of Herrick chapel to re-

‘ ceive the degrees we‘ve earned. There are

many members of our class who won‘t be
with us on that day. We'll miss them?
how could we do otherwise Even though
they’ve been gone two, perhaps three, years,
they’ve helped to strengthen our class loy-
alty and our feeling of pride ill this war—
time class of 1945. They drew a dirty job,
but they’ve done it gallantly as we knew
they would. The war threw a monkey
wrench into their college career, just as it
did in ours. But even though college hasn‘t
heell all sweetness and light as we expected,
we’re fortunate ill many ways for being a
wartime class, We leave Grinnell more
mature for the varying experiences we’ve
undergone here. We’ve learned a lot in
these last four years, and it hasn’t all come
from books \lillingly we assumed the re~
sponsibility willed to us by those Grinnel-
lians who left their college plans so that
we could keep ours. We’ve tried to retain
the way of life they loved, so that when
they come back the Grinnell ill their hearts
will be the Grinnell they‘ll find, altered
only ill that it will be a little filleri

We echo the sentiments of those boys
scattered over the world in saying that we
can’t even attempt to thank you for all the
wonderful things you’ve done for us. But
we’ll never forget them—or you. The sere—
nades of the Dibble men, the Yule Log
ceremony at Christmastime, the libe steps
in the spring, Baumann’s voice echoing
from his classroom — memories that will
never die.

For the last time we write “30" on a
story. It isn’t easy to do. We are eager for
the life ahead; yet, it is with reluctance
that we leave you. But because of you
we go with our heads held high, our vision
clear, and our hearts strong. We are proud
of you—may we make you proud of us.

OPEN FOR UM

 

To the Class of 1945—
rhc class of 1945 will be known
to history as the “Victory Class"
of the college. The graduating
seniors have lived through a
global war and have experienced
all of the dislocations which only
war can bring to a, college camv
pus. Most vivid in the memories
of college will be the excitement
of Pearl Harbor, the movﬂment
of men into the armed forces, the
coming of the army to the cam»
pus, the infinite adjustments
which have had to be made to
meet the exigencies of War,
The seniors will long remem-
her General Holdridge‘s Chair
lenge to them that they should
remain in school, doing their full
,rluty as a first line of reserve,
(They will be able to take quiet
‘piirle in the fact that they have
done their full duty. Outstand-
ing in the memory of the ad-
ministration of the college will
be the courageous manner in
which the men and women on
the campus adjusted themselves
to the many inconveniences made
necessary by our national effort.
The good humor with which the
students, under the leadership of
the seniors, accepted the responr
sibility for war service courses,
contributcd magnificently to Red
Cross activities, saved paper,
bought stamps and bonds, and
scarificially contributed to the
relief of war sufferers. Those
of us who have had the oppor-
tunity to observe the manner in
which the student body has met
the strain of war, maintained the(
traditional life of the college
with only minor impairments in
its program, have been proud to
be associated with such a. splen-
did grcup of young people, Gﬁnr,
nell will emerge from the war a
stronger and finer institution. Its
Victory over disaster will be due
in large measure to the charac~
ter, courage, and devotion of the
student body, We liavc a par-
ticulnr debt to the members of
this senior class who have car-l
ried on in spite of distractionsl
and maintained a high level of!
Grinnell citizenship in spite of:
