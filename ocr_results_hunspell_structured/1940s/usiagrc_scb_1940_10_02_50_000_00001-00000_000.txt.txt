pearances she has failed to ap-
preciate the great opportunity
which fortune presented her.

Frolicking gaily in pursuit of
a fly, "Lulu” dashed into an oc-

floor Monday. Entirely oblivious
to the interruption she had
caused, and with all the naivete
of her sex, she proceeded to ex-
plore each corner of the room.

Finally satisfied that there
were no canine messages to be
found, she turned up her nose and
stalked from the room. In the

tion” by emitting a noise as bar
monious as. the caterwauling on
a back fence at midnight,
