I Come What May.

The time has passed when a senior might
fix his gaze on a distant star and declare
with firm resolve that he would storm the
heights to achieve his goal. He faces a fu-
ture of uncertainty and hardship.

But, if there is no individual incentive to
spur us on, there is a group incentive that
presents a challenge of incalcuahle signifi-

3 Retrospect.

Even for those of us who have been on this
campus for the past four years, the phys-
ical changes brought about through the
building program this year are a source of
wonder and deep pride. Needed additions
have been made, the facilities of the college
are monthly increasing, and yet all this has
been done without basically changing the
memorable settillg of the school which we
have come to cherish.

Today, there are on campus Grinnellians
of former years, men and women he have
perhaps not seen the campus for ive years,
ten years, or half a century. For them, the
pride and achievement we feel must be in
creased in great measure. They see before
them a college which has not ceased its ad-
vancement; a college that looks forward as
confidently to the next century as it does
honorably to the last. And for them there
is a particular sense of achievement which
we have not yet come to share. For it is
largely through the effort and continued
friendship of these former students toward
the college that has made possible the 3m,
provements and advancements from which
we now benefit. As students we thank them
for these in leasing expressions of their
interest in Grinnell. And as alumni of next

In this field is his latest book,
“We Hold These Truths." a col-

ments, with an introduction by
Brown.

Everton's logic course will use

the forms of reasoning from Aris-
totle to modern symbolic logic.

next year are listed as ethics and
history of education, respectively.

FOOTBALL: The outstanding dc-
fenslve gridman that comes to
our mind is Howard Grimes, who
captained the 1932 eleven. . . He
was the closest thing to a brick
wall we've scan on the football
field. The most promising back-
field man in our estimation was
Fred Webb. , The most exciting
game witnessed was the Grinnell-
