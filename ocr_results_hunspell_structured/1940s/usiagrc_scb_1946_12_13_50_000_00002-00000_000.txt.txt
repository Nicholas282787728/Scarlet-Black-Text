Why Go Home?

Having spent the past three or four days
browsing. through travel folders in preparation for
the great egress which is expected next Wednesday,
we have decided that vacations are highly over-
rated. In fact, we've decided to spend those few
extra days right here in Griiinell—on the Lihe
steps.

After all, what is a vacation, but a few days
off to go back and see what the other half is
domg? In short, me inmates are given a brief
reprieve to make a break and return to the scene
of their crimes. They are loose just long enough to
subject society to their wanton wiles, and to have
law-abiding citizens decide that they belong right
back in the place from which they escaped.

Or look at it this way:.where else can you
have such excellent food thrown at you by such a
charming group of accommodating waiters; where
else can you get two cups of coffee-bean juice (sce
53:13, Oct. 11), without paying another nickel;
where else can you get a solid, uninterupted sleep
of four hours a night; where else can you do three
or four weeks of delightful research work on a
subject, and then get 65 in the course; where else
can you enjoy the benefits of such a crowded social
schedule that one scarcely has time to get a date
from one night to the next; and, finally, where else
can you find a more congenial atmosphere for
study than in the local ale-houses?

We'll he thinking of you when you’re com-
pletely exhausted from days of sleeping and nights
of merry madness. We'll be thinking of you as
you drive that filthy old 1946 Buick and as you
dig into that Christmas dinner, and excitedly open
