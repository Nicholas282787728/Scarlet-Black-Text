Pfitsch Lands Team
For Fighting Spirit

“The Grinnell team that lost
to Iowa State last Monday was

the best Ploneer’ Cage team that;
I have seen,” Said Coach John‘

Ptitsch. Although Grinnell missed
the height and shooting of Dave
Dunlop, sldellned with an ankle
iniury, the Pioneers still put up
a game fight hetorc Ialling to
their larger opponents, 70759.
Bigelow and Pelsner hit for 16
and 18 points respectively, but
Anderson got 22
garnered 17 for the Cyclones.
Although Iowa State opened iast

and rolled to an 1172 lead early’

in the game, the Pioneers re-
fused to stop righting. At half-
time Grinnell had pulled with
in five points, 38733.
