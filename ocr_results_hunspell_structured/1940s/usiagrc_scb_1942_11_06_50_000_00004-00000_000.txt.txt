Candidates Tackle

All Stars

The men‘s Hll'Stﬂl‘ touch foot—
bftll team will be pitted
against an officer candidates
team at Ward Field Friday
night at 7:45 p. m. '

Although the officer candida-
tes team has practiced very little,
all but two of its squad have had
experience in college football. Two
outstanding men on the army
squad are Fritz Pollard and
Eames. '

Pollard, a back who played for
Univeisity of North Dakota, was
chosen for the Little All-Ameri-
can team and was a lnirdler on
the Olympic team of 1940. Eames
played for Moor-head state chha
ers and was signed up with the
New York Giants, a professional
team, when he went into the
army.

Athletic officer VVhan, in
charge of the army team, is not
too ch'eerful about his teams pros—
pects but says, "The purpose is
promote and furdier the very
fine spirit of good relationship
wliich‘exists between the officer
candidates school and Grinnell
conege."

The all»stars, chosen by the in-
tramural board, are the cream
of the intramural players and are
all set for the game. After hear-
ing of the array of army talent
“Tooth" Hammond, all-star tackle,
said, “We'll fight to win." An
all~star disadvantage, however, is
that the allsstars represent dlfr
terent teams and are not used to
working together.

The all-stars probable better
understanding of touch football
and the rustiness of the army
team after a laysoff from college
football give the allsstars their
only chances for victory. John
c. Truesdale wiu officiate the
game. '
