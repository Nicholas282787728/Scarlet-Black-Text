For >1nsiance

Strolling across the campus in
the usual attitude 0[ deep prce
occupation which covers the most
trivial of thoughts or is an out»

ward expression of an inner val

cuum we were accosted by that
most sinister of characters, an
editor in search of copy. In l'er
ply to a defensive question about
the nature of the copy desired
the editor replied, "anything will
do." Here is anything.

The news today is replete with
unanswered questions. The ques
tions are not just idle matters in-
teresting to only the experts and
news analysts. The questions are
concerned with vital matters that
affect you and you and you and
all the rest of us. Matters affect
ing not just the quantity of em
lives but affecting the quality at
our collective future,

Undoubtedly the first from the
point of importance and interest
is the timing of the second front
Will it come in the next two
weeks while Roosevelt is away
from Washington vacation? Will
it come while Germany is reeling
in the Ukraine and while Hitler
is still rushing strong reinforces
ments to‘ the invasion coast? Will
it wait until the present attrition
carried on by the bombers has
had more effect?

On the military front we havi-
another big question that is of
prime importance to some several
hundred thousand young men in
the Navy and is scarcely less im-
portant to the United States as a
whole. That question is when is
the Japanese Navy going to come
out and right? We have learned
by now that the Japanese seem
to pick a favorable time and a
propitious place when they prEr
pare for any large scale attack
they do not go into a big battle
with any idea of defeat. We
learned that at Pearl Harbor and
Singapore.

On the domestic front we have
a question that rivals some oi
these others in importance and
outranks them in interest. The
question of the consequences and
reasons for the recent demise oi
Wendell Willkie from the Repubr
lican presidential campaign. Tc
many, Willkie represented a com»
bination of vigor, ideas and lib-
erality that could have led a na-
tion in war with marked success
Is it a return of the old guard? 15
it the beginning of the great re
action?

other questions in the news but
of lesser importance are: what
happened to Draja Mikhailovicii
the guerrilla leader in Yugoslav-
ia7; what does the failure at case
sino mean to the future role oi
air power?: how far will the
Japanese get in their present of
fensive in India. how much of

the Fuftewaffla Is left to defellf!

the invasion coast; how long can
the Russians keep up the momenr
tum of their present drive?

Time will give the answers tr
most of the questions here. May
be you know the answers to some
of them now. Any informatior
will be greatly appreciated.

Typical WSSF Work Underway in l’raly

 

t'i‘lle following feature has been

released by the WSSF News serv»
ice.)
More than 30,000 refugees have
flooded into Italy during the past
few months, according to the
World Student Schice Fund,
student war relief agency which
is related to the National Wai
Fund. Most of the refugees are
antrFascist Italians, and there
are also thousands of Yugoslav:
and Greeks, as well as numbers or
escaped British prisoner of wai
formerly held in ltaly.

"'I\\lo thousand of this great
influx of refugees aie students,”
writes the World Student Service
Fund. “They are eager to takr
up their studies again while they
are in Switzerland, Thus they
Will be equipped to play their part
as leaders in the reconstruction
of their own countries after the
war.”

Work Camps

The Swiss authorities have plac~
ed the Italians in work camp:
where they do useful work which
pays in part for their board and
keep. At the same time the au-
thorities recognize the special
needs of the student group. They
have placed them in special “un~
iversity camps" where the World
Student Service Fund's adminise
tering committee in Geneva has
organized academic work, Classes
are carried on by professors from
the Swiss universities who volun-
tarily give their services. ”It
must be remembered," the World
Student Service Fund writes “that
many of the Italian students are

table to read and study whatever

they wish, in a free university
setrup, for the first time in theil
careers.” The help from the
World Student Service Fund pro-
vides books, study materials and
some laboratory equipment for the
university camps.

The Yugoslav students number
250, and the Greek: 40. For both
individual admission into the
Swiss universities has been ar-
ranged. The Swiss educational

Training Stious Results

The significance of the training
of such hey persons has already
been demonstrated through the
Polish interiies in Switzerland
whom the WSSF‘S committee has
heell helping for four years. Those
who have completed their univer-
sity education in hospitable Switze
erlaiid are now spending their
time in teaching their fellow coun»
trymen of less than university
grade who are interned in SwitzV
erlaiid, others prepare study
courses in Polish which are sent
to Polish prisoners of war in
Germany. and which will undoubt-
edly be used in the beginnings of
educational rehabilitation in posts
war Poland. The some significant
results can be expected from the
splendid improvised educational
plan now being carried out
among Italian and Yugoslav stu-
dents. This work is made possi-
ble to a large extent because of
the generous support which
