IRC Hears Smilll,
Edil’orial Wriler

Mrs. Harriet Smith, editorial
writer for the Des Moines’ Reg-
ister and Tribune, spoke to the

will,

THC last evening. She discussed .

the operations of the two pa-
pers, with emphasis on the stile
torial page. “It may come as a
shock to some, but the editorials
for both papers are written by
the same staff of five."

Mrs. Smith argued strongly
for the continued existence of
editorial pages, stating that on
the Des Moines papers, at least,
their function is to stimulate
thought and to present balan-
ced arguments.

IRC officers were elected for
1949—50. Chosen were David
Hammer, Gates sophomore, pres-
ident; Jack Wilson, town sopho-
more, viceepx‘esident; Lee Patton,
GH junior, treasurer; and Sel-

It was one of those clear,
sunny days that make Spring
Spring.

The whole thing started when
Earl Peisner rang the bell. All
morning, 1,000 students were
walking on their noses, tracke
ing down cigarette butts. it
looked like a Wall St. panic
.with a different twist.

By noon there were several
baseball games going, when
everyone knocked ofi and heads
ed for Merrill park for some
chicken, pickles, and ice cream.
After all had devoured their
victuals, Dave Jelinek, the.holle
day emcee, announced a pier
eating contest.

Dean Dearborn and President
Stevens represented the admin-

Noble represented the house-l
mothers; Barbara McConihe,l
Haiiies senior, and Carolyn Fitz,
l Read sophomore, represented the
lfemale students; and Stu Roe-
der, Clark junior, and Jerry
Gibson, town junior, truly rep—
resented thc male students. ‘

While the other contestants
were busy trying to discover
the secret of the sportii. .,
smearing the pie all over your
face, to obviate eating itiGibe
lson and Roeder steamed in to
a juicy victory.

man. His reward was having his
beard, nose, and ears shaved by
Topsy Dowcy, Haines junior.

Then it happened. The sopho-
more men lined up on one side,
and the frosh males on the other
side of the mud pond on hole
one of the golf course. The sig»
nal was given, and the rope lost
the first round. It lost the secs
ond round too. But the third
round saw the freshman team do
a swan dive, en masse, into the
foot of water and three feet of
swectesmelling muck.

The Haines girls, fools that
they were, thought the game
looked easy, so they challenged
Read cottage to a tug. In short,
the Haines femmes are still
plucking mud out of their ears.
