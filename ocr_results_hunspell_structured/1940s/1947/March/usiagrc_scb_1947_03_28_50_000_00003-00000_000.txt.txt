There may be buds budding,
[lowers ﬂowering, birds nesting,
and young couples nesting too,
as indications ot approaching
spring, but in the dark recesses:
lot Dibble basement last week}
lslaved a group of dark rigures,
[each of whom knew that Spring
[could not oi'rieially come to sin:-
ciiell until the Zepliyrs eome.

 

This week, news was thrown upi
from the depths oi the Zephyr
otflccinews that Zephyr is on
its wayithat Spring will be in
Gl‘iiincllicvcn betore Easter va—
cation. In an exclusive 5 Av 13
interview, Chan Pitts, guest editor
for this issue or the campus hu—
mor magazine, promised the stu-
dent hody everything from eco-
nomic analysis to abstract alt
in the forthcoming publication.

“The only reason",
“that we shall not give away a
Maypolc tree with each copy, is
that students could not take May-
polcs home over vacation, and the
grounds department has forbid-
den that the campus be littered
with used Maypoles."

Zephyr will contain cartoons
galore, as well as articles dieta-
ting campus fashions, describing
expenditure of student fees. ex»
