Things Are Looking Up

Integration has set in. We could detect
signs of it last year in a few scattered in-
stanoes, but this year we can definitely see
that the campus is becoming unified in the
sense that Griiinellians before us used the
word, when referring to “before the war”.

Maybe it’s the freshmen who did it.
Their enthusiasm and spunk, evident at the
mass meeting and again at the football
game, has certainly put new life into this
old college campus, Then again, our football
team, much improved and with prospectof
a good year ahead, has a part in this in—
tegration, Whatever the causes of the
change, its effects are good.

It can be seen in the efforts of the
League Board and C of HP to work togeth-
er on campus issues and in the improved re-
lationship between the two governing bod-
ies, The fact that the administration talked
over and explained their temporary dis-
placement with Loose hall girls and the
spirit in which the girls, in turn, accepted
the situation, was an indication both of im-
proved administrntionsstudent relations and
a better attitude on the part of the stu-
dents.

Separate hall dances for the upperclass
women were demanded last year, regard-
less of the expense, This year will find more
cooperation among the women and conse-
quently more money in their treasuries.

Finally, prepping will again take place.
Just in case we should forget—this is a
college, not just “an institution’K

Yes, it really looks like integration has
at last set in—if you don‘t stop it, that is!

. . . In Some Cases

There is nothing in the Boston School
of Cooking that condemns as undesirable
the serving of diced carrots and boiled po~
tatoes with roast beef. Our mothers do it;
the college kitchen does it, Nor is the coat
ing of veal, better known as grey gristle, un-
palatable

As has been said, we eat it at home,
and we certainly are eating it at Grinnell.
The flaw in such diets is that they are serv-
ed here in the dining rooms with unvarying
regularity. Upperclassmen encountered on
their return menus identical with last

order to accomodate. Waiters have been
turned down as bad insurance risks

The students, for the most part, are
aware of the unavoidable arrangements of
eating in shifts and of the shortage of foods.
But it is expected that the administration
will continue to experiment so as to find
the most satisfactory solution.

011 Sunday evenings this year the stu-
dent population is forced to eat out Even
with the opening of the union, eating places
in Grinnell will be asked to handle over-
whelming crowds. Sunday night suppers,
from the point of view of the kitchen, are
very difficult to handle. _

Help must be given time off, and in or-
der to prepare foods that will keep until
served, menus of last year would undoubted-
ly be repeated Either alternative is unhap—
py. Student help is one answer to the prob-
em.

Doctor Stevens, when interviewed this
week, took his stand on the situation, "I
now that, in comparison with eating and
living conditions in other schoools I’ve seen
in Iowa and the middlewest, our conditions
here are priviledged." The students in
Cowles who found flour weevils crawling
across the noodles last Wednesday are
doubtless of another opinion.

Mistakes that have been made and are
tolerated in the dining rooms now are not
mistakes that would be remedied by a raise
in tuition to meet the rising food costs.
They are errors that could be corrected by
wiser planning by the administration and
more constructive action by the students.’
