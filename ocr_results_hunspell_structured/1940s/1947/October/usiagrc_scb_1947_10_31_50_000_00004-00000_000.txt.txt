Cautious Pioneers

To Face

A careful but ready Pioneer
eleven will Journey to Cedar Rap-g
ids tomorrow in an attempt to,
soil Cee college's homecoming and;
at the same time annex their
third conference win of the sea—,
son. Though fresh from last'
week’s upset over the highly—fav-i
ox‘ed Hilltoppers from Mt Vet?
non, Coach cakes and his charges
are not putting the Coe game in
the victory column hefore the
kickoff. Coe, though still without
a. conference Win to its Credit,.
will undoubtedly be at its seuel
son’s peak tomorrow, especially}
before a large homecoming crowd.i

In losing 47—0 last week to a
powerful Lawrence team, Coe re-
eeived a serious setback in the}
injury of its two quarterbacks.
However, it is not deﬁnite that
the injuries will keep them out‘
of the lineup. Grinnell will be}
without me services of its de-l
pendable backfield star, Kermit,
Steinbeck, who suffered a broken‘
leg hone in last week‘s Cornell]
gamer Outside of these injuries,‘
both teams will put the usual
lineups on the field.
