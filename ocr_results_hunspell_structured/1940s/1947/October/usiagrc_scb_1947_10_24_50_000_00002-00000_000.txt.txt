GRINNELL SCAIILET AND BLACK

OCTOBER 24, “74

 

Welcome Alumni

Welcome back to old Grinnell, a Grin—
rell the same as u hen you left. True, there
. surface changes. Barracks line the
ootball field uhere children cheer when
Daddy's got the ball. A dormitory looms on
t e old hockey field.

That brown structure cutting central
campus is our new student union. There
a. 0 other things too, but these do not
ctang‘e “old Grinell",

A freshman girl's hairdo desperately
c'iapted to her hat, the g1 cups drifting past
to chapel toward town, decorations on all
be dorms: these bring you clearly the feel-
ii‘g‘ of Homecoming. It is a feeling which
you return. Your interest and enthusiasm
xrake both faculty and students happy to
g’cet you with “welcome back”.

' We wish to extend our greeting to the

rd of Trustees as well as the alumni.
101 we see them no more often. Though
t‘vey determine largely the way students
lixe and learn at Grinnell, the board is
p‘actically unknown. (Is it surprising that
W) student asked could name more than

ee Weinbers of the board? We think
not.)

People are remembered best when met

e to face, but that opportunity comes
..e|y for students and board members.
\ilien we consider the importance of the
ho id to us, it seems only natural that we
slould become better acquainted.

The spirit of Grinnell should extend

ond I’iomecoming, bringing you back,
no once each year, but on many occasions.
Don’t let the friendliness and familiarity of
this fall slip away until next October. Make
I-fomccorning the best of a number of visits
you have at Giinnell each year.

Not A Breeze - A Cyclone

Fulfilling its obligation to the student
body in directing publications about camp
'us, the Board of Publications, a student-

culty group, has agreed that unless 65
per cent of the student body (750 students)
subscribe for the 19475118 Cyclone by Sun-
day, hope of presenting a yearbook to Grin—
]Ie undergraduates and alumni must be
auandoned.

The strident body is then in imminent

' ger of losing authority to publish arec»

C- d of its personality and achievement. If
cond tion is to be averted, immediate
on is essential.

Tl is action will result in more efficient
budgeting of funds, culminating in better
arvportionment throughout the book. Then,
1(0, in rising to tthe presciibedgoal, the
student body proves not only its interest in
c,eating the yearbook, but also its interest
ir improving a reas iable Grinnell tradition.

Cogent reasoning directs that the Cyclone
staff itself remain in complete accord nith

Spirals of in Ition are particularly ac»
tive in the printing industry. Costs of paper,
of print, and of being assured of funds to
defray printing expenses.

Evident are the advantages of a wor-

thy publication:

1. The new Cyclone will serve as a per
mancnt record of the college as e ‘-
emplified through the activities of
students. -

.All phases of campus life will be
recorded.

. Training in managing, writing, and
editing a fullrsized publication is of-
fered. ,

. Student support in an unfeigned un-
dergraduate activity can be denied
strated.

Grinnell’s yearbook can not become a

reality without added support. BUY YOUR

Not A Cyclone - Jus+ Wind

Foul rumors have it (and they can
have it!) that we are once again to be
visited by that so-called journal of campus
miscellany the poor man's New Yorl‘cr.
known in underground circles as the Grin-
nell college Zephyr (whisper its name!)

If these rumors, by some unforeseen
fluke become substantiated, the effect may
well be staggering, for, steeled as it is
against the demoralizing influences of this
seamy periodical, it is highly doubtful that
a campus such as ours can return to a state
of normalcy in less time than a semester.

As a service to our readers, we feel it
a sacred duty to report some of the intrigue
surrounding the ex—blacklisted tabloid and
Its begetters. in the hope that readers of

distinction will not again be corrupted by
this bawdy banter. .

Did you know, innocent reader, the
co-editors Horn and Glaman were the only
two employees in the government’s Burea
of Surplus Base Telephone Directories an
itinerant Waste Paper who didn’t pass th
recent loyalty check:7 It seems they lie]:
strict loyalty to another form of trash, am
to this end had cleverly salted away 4,75
phone books (1942-43) and a litre of bubbl
gum wrappers for future use.

Need we remind you of the hast
flight, last year, of two former editors wh-
escaped to Scandinavia following the ap

\‘ rance of the first issue? They are stil
ited, we understand, by a certain Con
‘essman. It is only ir that we pass on t-
you the latest underground report that on
ii genes and business staff are alread
glancing through Somaliland travel folders
Beware!

All of which will serve to put you 0
your guard for tonight’s issue of what i
laughing-1y called “the magazine of colleg-
life". We suspect the editors and staff OI
a multiplicity of journalistic outrages, and
sight unseen, question all their sources
especially where this noble and decorou
newspaper is concerned.

Be Kind To The Waiters

Cartoons, radio comedians, and popular
opinion to the contrary, waiters AR
people. To more‘than a few students, r
waiter is no more than a hand and an
which comes, like the Greek, bearing gift
0.1L, so you paid your board bill and you‘
entitled to that plate. But so did that wait
er, and he’s not getting any more for Iii
$320 per annum than you are.

True, waiters are paid the coolie wage
the administration calls a wage standard
but those white-coated slaves consider iI
hardly worth the effort. When Waiter
makes between 7 and 12 trips to the kitche
at dinner only to be told, “Hey, get on th-
ball » I’m hungry”, he isn‘t too happy.

If Waiter B finds those beets sittin
in a puddle of milk guarded by a crushe-
creamed potato and a coffee soaked nap
kin, he is inclined to be just a wee bit bit
ter. Waiter K edges through a space
foot wide, and hears, “I-leyl Watch it. Don‘
knock over this coofeel” Put together
\I'aiters A, B, and i( spell sarcasm and dis
content to anybody who takes the troubl
to notice.

The foreign legion beckons when 3 or
4 late-comers demand their pieces of'pie
which, chances are, was all gone 20 minutes
ago. Conversely, the dietitian’s war clu-
descends on the waiter swiping- extras for
those whose friendship for him depends
upon his procuring the same.
