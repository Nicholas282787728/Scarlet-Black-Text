Sliif Viking Offense i
In Home Territory ‘

Lawrence college handed thcl

loss 0[ the season last Saturday
in Appleton, wis., as they romped
to a 27-0 victory.

The Vikings drew first bloodl
in the second quarter, as George;

l

from the 7-yerd line, after a 427
yard setrllp run by Reed Forbnshl
still on the offensive, Lawrence
lcolltinuetl to march after the
kickoft, with Forbusll gaining is
yards on a reverse and scoring
four plays later from the 5-yard
line. Roeder's.conversion made it,
it to 0. §

Grinnell held the hard-charg-‘
ing Vikings in the third quarter,
and in the last traine took to thep
air, gambling on a belated pass‘
attack. ‘Pioncel‘ hui-lers just
couldn't connect when it counted,
and Lawrence once again took
over, with Flom streaking acrossl
for the third tally. The final quar- ‘
tei- ended as Joe Moriarity, vik-.
ing end. snagged two passes from
Spence Potter, scoring the final
touchdown of the game.

As was expected, Lawrence
fielded a heavy. hard-running
team which outclassed the Pion-
eers in almost every department.
Grinnell fought back hard in ad
versity, but poor tackling, pass-
ing, and non-clicking ground
plays hampered the Pioneer ef-
forts.

The two teams lost a total of
135 yards in penalties, and Grins
nell lost 19 yards in rushing
