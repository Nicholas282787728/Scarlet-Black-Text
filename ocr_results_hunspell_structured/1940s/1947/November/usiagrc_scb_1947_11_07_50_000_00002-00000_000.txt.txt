— On Being Self-Governed

Each spring at Grinnell in tlle heat of
campus elections tlle phrase ”student gov-
ernment" reaches tlle consciousness of tile
student body. It becomes the rallying cry
and to that candidate who can most ef—
fectively incorporate this principle in his
platform comes success at the ballot box.
For a few feverish weeks this phrase be—
comes the epitome of student desire and
iiltent, Ill the mind’s eye a rosy illusion
bloouisiolie of an independent and respoll»
sible student body electing its own officers,
conducting its own affairs, and living ill a
self-regulated community of interests, free
from the surveillance and interference of
the administration,

But as illusions crash so does “student
government”, as soon as the fever has spent
itself. Once installed in office the student
representatives are faced with the leth-
argy of half-hearted interest, lack of cooper-
ation and ill some instances violation of the
principles tlle recent ”balloteers” pl‘oclnlmr
ed with “do or die” zeal. It ‘s only when
an “incident" occurs which requires the oer
tion of the administration that. student
consciousness is re-aroused But even then
failure “of student responsi i ity and neglect
of community interests are not recognized
as the reasons for the interference of the
monster, administration
, Such an incident has occuried, namely,
that of the ARI-I chairs vhich were dame
aged and broken in campus fever of Home-
coming- exuberallce. Here is a classic ex
ample of direct violation of community inc

To state the case fully: Though the
incident took place over two weeks ago,
there has been no action by the officers
elected from the coiliniiuiity. The Council
of House Presidents, which should Ye lake
en the major share of responsiblity for
finding the culprits and punishing them,
has refused to have anything to do with
it. The Student Council, outside of a mum»

about the total cost, has also taken no ac-

Dear Editor:

Believe it or not, for more thsni
20 years I have slwnys said I
was a Chinese until I read your
Oct. 17 issue in which Dr. Hort,
gentleman and scholar from the
University of California, saidthat
i“there is no such thing as a
Chinese”. He is an Orientslistw
he must know. I must be wrong.
in saying 1 am as Chinese! {

it seems clear to me that in}
this world you cannot afford to
lbs either good nst'ured or poor.
iPcopie have a tendency to make
‘thc goodrnatured person do all
, the work and take all the blame,
or course a poor man who has
troubles is no man at all. idem

undoubtedly be made by the administration
, This situation alone clearly demon-
strates why the students of this school are
treated as children, with the deans of men
and women forced into ,tr ing, as much as
possible, to know every action of every stu—‘
dent every minute. Only a crew of child-
minds swayed by mob action woilld Consider
it hilariously funny to do $320 worth of
damage in one evening. Only a group of
irresponsible adults would refuse to move
after an action which so flagrantly violates
community interest.

How can we expect to gain meaningful
student government when we refuse to take
the resopnsibility which accompanies it?

One solution for our present problem
of gutless government is that the C of HP
fiile each hall a certain amount of the total.
Our question is: Should 500 lnen have to
pay for the lawlessness and ill-chosen antics
of 50'?

Our suggestion is that the C of HP
find the indivdll'slls who participated in this
limiter, fine them, and then drop the whole
thing- We ask only that the individual be
made sponsible for his own actions. We
are quite sure that a. majority of the stu-
dents involved had no intent of doing real
damage, but, having done So, are adult
enough to bear their share of the cost. We
think that it has become the place of the
student government, in this case the C of
Hl’, to act effectively and with a sense of
responsibility for the interests of the cam—
pus community. '

It the desire to attain independence
from the administration is a fiery issue in
March campaigns, wliy cannot that same
(1 .e retain its potency as a working prin»

)le throughout the year?
