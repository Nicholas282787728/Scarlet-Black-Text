Pioneers To Face Lawrence Cagers,
Monmouth Five In Conference Race

Coach Ben Douglas will send

a well»tried five into tomorrow

evening's game with second
place Lawrence, in what may
prove to be a. crucial match in
the Midwest Conference race. The
Pioneer aggregate has suffered
defeats throughout the season,
often times by narrow margins,
and this game has possibilities of
giving the Pioneers the break
they have been looking for.

The probable starting lineup for
the Scarlet and Black cagei-s wrll
be Al Carlson, center, Brunie Van-
strum and Earl Peisner, forwards,
and Tex Kaufmanii and Edd
Bowers at the guard spots.

Next Tuesday evening, the
Pioneers will seek revenge for a
previous defeat, when they en—
gage the Monmouth team on the
Darby court. The Illinois club
has lost three out of four en-
counters in conference play'tliis
year, but advance notices give in-
dications of improvement in their
play, and the game should be
a close battle. The probable
starting lineup for this game will
be the same as for the Lawrence
contest, should the athletic Gods
see fit to keep injuries at a min-
imum.

Loses Thriller To
Augus’rana Cagers

Grinnoll lost a thrill- -pnckad‘
contest to the boslteteers of Aug-‘
ustana, 52- 50, Jan 25, in the Illa
inois fieldhouse

Trailing by a single point with
only one minute remaining, Grill-
neil knotted the count at 50-50 on
a free throw. Then, the Pioneers
witnessed a miracle basket by
Riley of the Norsenien, which
tumbled on the hoop, spun. and
slipped through for the deciding
markers. A Grinncll desperation
shot missed ﬁre as the last few
seconds wilted away.

Vanstrum was high point man
for Grinnell with ii points, fol-
lowed by Carlson, Kaufmaiin,
and Peisner With nine each Riley
was a thorn to the Iowa quintet
all night, racking on a total of
15 to his credit. Gildea and
Johnston were other standouts
for the Viking crew.

Coach Ben Douglas saw his ont-
fit run to an eight point advanr
Logo with seven minutes left in
the first period, but a rally by
Augustaria erascd this margin to
24723 Grinnell, at the half.

An all—out second half was foa-
ltured by a tempo of play which
was hard and fast. Douglas sub-
stituted freely in an attempt to

ticing on the indoor track in the
women's gym. Coach Les Duke
feels that the men now working
out show much promise, but he is
disappointed with the small tuin»
out he has had. It is hoped that
more men will appear on the chi-
der circuit, as the season advances

ings take the offtnsive edge, and
race to a narrow two point Vic»
toi-y, defeating Grinnell, 52750.
