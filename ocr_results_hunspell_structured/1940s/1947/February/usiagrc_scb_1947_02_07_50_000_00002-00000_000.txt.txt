Breakfas+ Blues

Grinnell students (most of them, at
least) are paying $160 each semester to eat
in tile college dining rooms. This breaks
down to something like ten 'dollars a week
or nearly a dollar and a half per day spent
for our vittles. An exact breakdown of food
costs is not available; you pay your money
and take your chances,

These chances during the past few
years have included increasing food costs
as well as t.he vagaries of institutional 'cook—
ing and (formerly) rationing.

Nevertheless, and with all due respect
to the difficulties the school is encountering
from rising food and labor costs, there are
certain misunderstandings concerning tlle
present actions of the food department.

For example, seldom do more than
half of the students eat the breakfast [or
which they have paid. This is a perennial
situation and reflects in no way upon the
college, for it's obviously the student’s fault
if he refuses to eat eggs, cereal, toast and
coffee every morning before his eight
o’clock, Presumably, the food department
has long been aware of this absenteeism and
makes its plans accordingly. And, presume
ably, the money saved by not preparing
breakfast for several hundred students is
used to improve the other two meals each
day.

But students ale wondering how much
the breakfast coffees and rolls at various,
local food shops are really costing them.
They figure that in addition to what they
pay the restaurant, they're also paying a
pro-rated share of board money for break-
fasts they don’t eat at the college.

These students have felt the pinch of
increasing living costs too, and are now wonr
dering about some way of cutting down on
these expensive breakfasts-They’d like a
rebate on the money they paid for break—
fast; or if that isn’t feasible, perhaps the
breakfasts could be served on a meal ticket
basis.

Food'prices are beginning to drop.
Butter is already back to its former level,
and is now even cheaper than margarine.
In all fairness to the student, this price drop
should be reﬂected by giving him the bene-
fit of these few extra dollars.

As a practical suggestion (which has
been used with success at Northwestern,
Wisconsin, Columbia, and numerous other
schools), we would like to propose a system
of meal tickets~if not for every meal, for
breakfast at least. In this way, the college
would still get the benefit of having the
student pay in advance, and the student
would get the benefit of approximating how

On The Air ‘

See that little box on page three? it
says "On The Air”. It is intended (believe
it or not) to point out to loyal Grinnellians
that Colle ium Grinnelli Ioivense is on the
air at certain times each week, I

Recently, we joined the Tall Corn net
work, which, together with other broadcast
time, gives us a total of nine or ten airings
a week. For those who ignore the little box;
for those who don’t know it exists; and for
those who read it and think it is an ad for
radio stations, we give this reminder that
you may hear Grinnell on the air at the
following dial settings: KFJB, Marshalltown,I
1230; WOI, Ames, 405; KBUR, Burlington,
1490; KSIB, Creston, 1520; KFVD, Fort
Dodge, 1400; KWPC, Muscatine, 86 , KBIZ,l
Ottumwa, 1240; KICD, Spencer, 1240, and it
is expected to be heard shortly over WGNB

weekly schedule. ‘ I
