Poli’rical Palaver

‘On February 24th, primary votes for the 19477
48 Student Council presidency will be cast. On
March 8th, the annual convention will be held, and
candidates will indicate. their "party platfor The
election of Student Council president will take
place on March 10th This presidential campaign
in miniature may seem of little importance to those
students who are already eligible to vote in llatlolh
al elections, but to others , . . those who are not
yet 21 . , . it will be a time when they may ”Lest
their Wings" as good citizens of a community.

During the iext seven days we must decide
the student poii cal policy at Grinnell. It will be
the work of the general and central committees
of the‘ present and future student councils to draw
up a new constitution. It must be a constitution
which will remedy the mistakes of the past, regu-
late the excesses and shortcomings of the past,
result in the proper] amount of cooperation and

fresponsibillty. in the student-administration relar
tionship. Your Student Council president must have
the ability and the desire to represent you With
vigor and honesty

The student Council is a representative body,
and it most accurately reflect the wishes of the
students. The Student Council is also a mediating
body. and it must publicize the viewpoint of the
administration. In fulfilling these often contradic-
tory positions, it must be especially careful to steer
an even course. Willful demands on the part of
students who have not troubled' to asce~tnin the
facts must be tempered skillfully before presenta»
tion to the administration, At the same time, the
Student Council must be eager to explain and de
fend student rights when they conflict with man-
datory regulations which blindly ignore student
opinion. .

The present Student Council has worked for
cooperation, acting as a coordinating body for the
Council of House Presidents and the League Board,
strengthening student-faculty understanding ap—
pointing an advisory board to the President. It
fostered the Midwestern student Government Con-
ference, which met at Grilmell in November. It

‘Results have been encouraging, buL blley are by no
means perfect. After a preliminary breakfast con-
ference with the President, the advisory board
was not called upon again. Surcly events of ms
terest to the student body cannot have been settled
as easily as that without an occasional confer-l
encc?

The 194743 Student Council must be alert,
ever-ready to defend the student viewpoi:t, and
yet must strive for more perfect understanding
between the administration and the students, The
Student Council president must be worthy of such
a position.
