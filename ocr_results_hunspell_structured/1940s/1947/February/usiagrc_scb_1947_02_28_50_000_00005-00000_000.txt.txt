GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Carl Team Takes
Grinnell Five 63-52

Last Saturday the Criiinell cage
team took to the road and playedi
the Carleton college five at
Nortlifield, Minn. The Carls' fast
offense proved to be a little tool
much for the Pioneers, and the
home team held the heavy end ofl
the 63 52 score

Earl Peisiier s 19 points toppedl
the Pioneers’ scoring errors, and
the Carls heavy counter was
Tliuriiblad, who flipped the balll
for 23 counters. The game wasl
the last meeting of the twoi
teams for the 1947 season.
