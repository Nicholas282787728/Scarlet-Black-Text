ordered to mask the ceiling.

The decision was the outgrowth
of a meeting with President
Stevens held last week by social
chairmen from north and south
campus and the manager of
Gadabouts. The canopy, to be
made of transparent blue mater—
ial, will be hung from the cen-
ter beam and raised and lowered
on pulleys and ropes. It will be
raised during gym classes, and
lowered to the balcony for
dances. ‘

sets of curtains will hide the

various colors so that they may;

be changed to suit the theme at
each function.

While thc college will assume
the cost of the project, campus
organizations and halls will res
pay one-half. A part of this
half will be raised by adding a

nominal amount to each student-ter

admission fee for the next few
years. The money collected will
he put into a fund which will be
used to replace worn decoration

materials.

to colleges having a between—
semester vacation.

However, veterans graduating
or otheiwise leaving school at
the end of this semester will
automatically receive this vaca-
tion unless they notin the vet—
