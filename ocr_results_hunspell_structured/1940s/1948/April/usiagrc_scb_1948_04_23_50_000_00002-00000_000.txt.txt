Politics Spoken Here

in the last month it has been no secret
tliiit ii detinite political climate has hover-
ed about Gi'iniicll campus. Thecrgzinizzk
Lion 01‘ 2i club to hack 3 particular cantil—
date for the presidential nomination; the
attendance at ward, county and state party
conventions; and the appearance of partisan
speakers all testil'y that this student body
ill not only politically conscious but is in a
p05ltioii to air its views and take action
upon them.

While these columns are inclined to
find fault and deliver diatribes, we feel, in
this case, that our energies are better spent
in piaise. For, when we read or the limi-
tatlons on political activities of other cam:
puscs, we realize that the adn'iinistration ol
Grinnell college 11 demonstrated a most
commendable and liberal attitude toward its
amateur politicos and wouldbe ward~hcel~
crs.

’l‘herc lit been no ban on avowed cun-
didates for public oft to as czinipu peak—
ei‘siwitne ' one Carroll Switzei', Demo-
cratic candidate fin U‘overnor of Iowa. No
person has been denied the i 'ht to tip-
peiu‘ because of his’ party klf liiition or
the tenets he espouses.

It is most heartening to read in the Des
Moinos Register the statement of our presi
dciit, ”We are ‘ee, open and interested in
all} point of view-”land to knoii that, if
enough students are interested enough to
spolisoi and zit-range a meeting, their speak-
er can be heard without an arbitru y silencs

~ing.

At thist ime, therefore, on behalf 01‘
the students of Grinnell college we should
like to e\tcn(l a sincere invitation to
Henry Wallace, Glenn Taylor, John L.
Le“ Earl Browdcr. and any of the Sii~
called “controversizil’ ﬁgures on the
American scene. Suicly he a students
could benefit by listening to such Stillm-
luting speakers.

, We can truthfully say that not only have
\ e been abetted but aided in our desire to
indei'stand and observe the grass roots of
government. Ask anyone who received
as used class cuts for his trip to the Mon—
tezuma and Des Moines conventions

Certainly one can see that it has been
s udcnt interest rather than administr tive
dictates that has determined our political
activity. So, for this time, we send ti few
roses to the Administration building for
fostering an environment in which its stu-
dents are tree to shape their own political
opinions an< gain the information 01' speak-
