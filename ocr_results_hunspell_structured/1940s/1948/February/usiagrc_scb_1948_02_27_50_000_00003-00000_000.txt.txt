RCA Mirror's rising star of the keyboard

"GONNA

GET A GIRL"

ITHIN the past few months, Larry Green has
climbed right up with the top bands of the land!

ence that Camels suit my ‘T—Zone’ to a ‘T‘!”

Try Camels! Discover for yourself why, with Smokers
who have tried and compared, Camels are the “choice

of experience”!
