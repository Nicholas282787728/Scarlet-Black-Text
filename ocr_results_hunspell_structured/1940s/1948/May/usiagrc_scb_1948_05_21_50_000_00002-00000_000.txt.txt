lil'CC is ready to go on the air.

The ultimate success 01 the entire vein
lies in cooperation from three direct-

student body itsell. A skeleton student

Pilkii1gten and Jack Sheriff, both of

among the l’ eshmeu g rls conducted by
Piolessm Purma and the senior sociology

students is helpful in Viewing the situation

 

a bit mole objectively. On some scoies \ve'

 

can b e ouiselves a pat on the back; oth-
ers ineiit 21 \101d of caution.

On the credit side, we’d like to consder
the following

Firstly, cliques on South Campus seem
to be quite broad in scope. Nearly everyone
is 21 member of one or another and the iso-
lates are relatively fewer than might be ex-
pected in most similar situations.

Secondly, there was no evidence 01' the
unhealthy situation evidenced by
pahsf’ that is, there are no cliques com-
posed of the 21nd only two.

Thirdly there is hardly a trace of any
kind of discrimination because of member-
ship in a minoritv group.

For the above, congratulations are in
order,
we’ve had all along, that there is somethingl
subtly unique about our way of living. There
are other observations which, while far
1 om dark and foreboding, show the neces—'
sity of caution.

For one thing, one semester seems to be
ample time to form a clique which is rela-
tively tight and gives evidence of
permanance. Four years is 21 long- time t
spend in the
of associates.

Cliques also tended to center not only
within the cottage, but on individual floors.
In other words, piopinqnity seems to be an
important factor in, the formation of friend-
ships. This is only natural during the f 'st
few months of college life, but the danger
L that the clique thus formed may, through
laziness or lack of interest, continue to dome
inate the social life of the individual, and
much that is 01' value may be missed.

All in all, however, the study leaves us
with little cause to apologize for our Way 01'
living: Year by year, those who would tend
to isolate themselves from the g oup‘
through shyne or disinterest are broiiglitl
into the swim: oi college lite and 1821111 t
