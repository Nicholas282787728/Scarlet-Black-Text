GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Quad Council Sole Survivor

Of Last Year’s War Group

For Acﬁvi’ries

The only organization for war
actiVity functioning on Grinhcll
campus at the present time is the
war service council in the quad
ranglc, a Scarlet and Black in-
vestigation has shown.

TheWar Chest committee, in—
augurated last year on the sug-
gestion of John Gannaway, pro-
fessor of pol' ical science, as a
single financial agency for emerge
ency activities, has not met this
year.

“I merely helped get the come
mittee organized," Gannaway said
yesterday. “It’s up to the stu—
dents now."

As yet, no one has been name
ed to replace Charlotte Joiner. ex
'43. who served as chairman last
year.

No action has been taken by
the men‘s defense committee, a!»
so initiated last year, with Wil-
liam Van Duzer as chairman.

However, at a meeting of the
student organiuxtians committee
it was recommended that “the
Women's self government asso-
ciation be empowered by the stu-
dent council to manage and dis—
perso its own war chest fund,
and to maintain its own separate
war service committee"

Since the Women‘s committee
raised a considerable part of the
$65 on deposit in the separate
War Chest, it was further recom-
mended that sso be given to the
women's war council which is

 

new active and needs the money
to further its program.
Control Control J‘lzlmlcll

Final recommendation of the
committee was for the establish-
ment of a controlling body for
all campus emergency work, come
posed of chairman of the we-
mell's committee, a representative
of student council, and one {mm
the men's organization of last
year. This council of three would
have the authority to represent
all students in common projects
for the war service.

It would also serve in place
of a separate men's war service
council since representatives at
iilic organizations meeting relt
college men are occupied with
special courses this yeitr in prep-
aration for the armed forces.

Even with only one student
group functioning for war work
this year, enthusiasm is not as
high as it was last year, when
war was only a possibility.

Red Cross Work Begun

ing offered, including first aid,
home making, and canteen work,
but enrollment is not as large as
