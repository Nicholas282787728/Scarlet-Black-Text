Order of Roll call. ,

A nomination roll call will be
taken of all halls and cottages
in alphabetical order. Any del-
egate may make a nomination,
but the nominee must be taken
from the candidates remaining
in the race at the time of the
opening of the convention. The
maximum time for presenting
a. candidate's name to the con—
clave has been set at ten min-
lites.

Following the nomination roll
call of the entire delegation, the
balloting on candidates will start.
The chsirmsn of the delegation
will instruct the delegates to vote
according to the proportion of the
total house vote received by each
of the candidates. These instruc-
tions will hc binding to the dele-
gates only on the first ballot. The
delegations will vote through their
chairman, it being his duty to col-
lent the individual ballots of his
delegation before each ballot, A
delegate may challenge the vote
of his own delegation if he thinks
that there has been 2, miscount.

The balloting shall proceed un»
m lwo cnndidnfes shaJl receive
35 per cent of the tow vote on
n simulinncous ballot. The con-
vention will immediately be ad»
journed when such a conclusion is
reached.

For Tuesday's general election
the voters will be registered as
they vote by judges appointed by
the student council. The rules
also state that “there shall beno
campaigning within 100 feet of
the polling place.”

Judges' Powers.

The Jud s are also to act as
an election board, which “shall.
announce the results of the elec»
tion, and hear any charges of
misconduct during the election.
They shall have full power to act
in all cases of corrupt practices.”

As the time for the opening of
the convention draws near, the
results of Thursday night's bal-
loting in the quadrangle still is-
main a secret. Dibble hail also
has refused to give out the re-
sults of their voting. Thus, the
trend of the majority of the dele-
gates' votes on the first ballot of
the convention erI not be known
to the public until the first roll
call of the balloting begins.
Delegates Are Instructed.

Delegates from the seven re~
maining halls and the town men
have been instructed to vote as
follows on the first ballot:

Smith hilllAGeorge Bishop,

Pearce, 4 for Hampton.

Votes are known for the opening
ballot, but there are still 96 to
be heard from. Much speculation
has been made about the outcome
of the first ballot. Some believe
that there will only be one bale
lot necessary to nominate the
two candidates, whilc others feel
that many rollrcalls will have to
be taken before a conclusion is
reached. At any rate, this after-
noon will make history on the
Grillnell campus. The three sen-
iors who are to act as the elder
non board and judges for the
gcnernl ballot are: Jane Goplerud,
Robert Young, and Jerry Fort.
