Students, Teachers
Aided by WSSF

Contributions to the World Student Service Fund campaign
here, which opens Monday, will directly benefit university stua
dents and teachers in war devastated nations all over the world,

said Paul Glaman, Smith junior, WSSF campaign committee chairsl

man.

“The World Student Service
Fund, the only organization
pledged to give aid to univers
sity people in all parts of the
world, regardless of race, color,
or creed, is working today in
Europe, China, and Southeast
Asia," Glarnan continued. “The
WSSF is the only American rep»
resentative of World Student
Relief, and all of the ‘relatively
ptosperous’ nations of the world
have similar national commit.
tees to raise funds for student
relief.

“England and. the Scandina-
vian countries, poor as they are,
relative to us, raise more money
per student for relief than the
United States," he said. “Even
China, which needs help in
every category so badly, raises
a given sum each year for aid
to European students, as a token
of student solidarity around the
world."

Students abroad have inaugu»
rated and are carrying on in-
genious and comprehensive self~
help programs, Glaman stated.
Mimeograph cooperatives in un-
iversities throughout Europe
and Asia are reproducing the
textbooks destroyed in the war;
student laundries, shoe repair
shops, restaurants, banks, have
been created by the students
themselves.

-“They look to us for the
things they cannot possibly pros
duce themselves," Glaman said.
“They need things like eray
machines, microscopes, and
mirneograph machines for the
cooperative publishing units—
the equipment they simply can-
not get anywhere but here. “For
