Critic Evalues ‘Moonlightf
.Nominates Sat. Night Cast

By Jean Kiefcr

Entirely different interpretations were given to the
characterizations of Sarah and her daughter Jane through
double-casting these roles for lthe two performances of Mrs.
Moonlight lds’t week-end. The Saturday night cast, as a
whole, using the Phyllis Finalise—Kathleen Mool'head com-

bination, seemed more Closely integrated,

smoother production.
Earl Swearingen sustained the
mood of the whole performance,

and gave two consistently excel-1

lent characterizations of Tom
Moonlight in spite of having to
adjust himself to a different lcad-
ing lady each night. This role cle~
serves even more credit because of
the nature of Mr. Moonlight him-
self. Aging 47 years in two
hours is a considerable feat in it-
self, and to be able to put across
a convincing performance that
pleased the audience without an
obvious humor angle is even more
difficult.
mesa'n As Minnie

Ann Jacobson, as Minnie, was
beloved for her acrid humor as
much by the audience as by
Sarah and the rest of the Moon-
light household. The ,manner in
which she interpreted the old, old
family protector in the third act
was on the some high per as the
characterization of Mr. Moonlight.

Edith Jones-1 brusque, old<
maidish, andamartyr in her mind,
was portrayed by Elizabeth John-
.son in a convincing but slightly
forced manner.

Interpretation or shrub

JoAnn Koehler interpreted Mrs.
Moonlight as a rather shallow,
highly emotional woman
tinged any event with drama and
over-emphasized her own im-
portance. This role seemed a little
out of step with the rest of the
cast, a little obvious.

Phyllis Pincus played Mrs. Moonr
light with much more restraint,
making her more a member of the
cast than the leading lady. in
spite of her obvious inability to
play the piano, Miss Flllcus sus-

aspects of poetry, Mr. Brown
asserted that a good poem will
stand up under rigorous technical
scrutiny, and that, if a poem is
to be considered worth while, the
experience portrayed must itself
be worth while “To be a firsta

Jane Moonlight

The two approaches to ‘Janc
Moonlight had different values.
Marjorie Kraft was much more
realistic as the lovesick Jane of
the second act, while Kathleen
Moorhead seemed 'more nearly

conservative Janc of the third
act would be,
