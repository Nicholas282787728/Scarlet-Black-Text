Aviaiion Club
ls Discon’rinued

Unfil Nexl' Fall

“Skyways,” Gl'inilell's aviation
club, has served its purpose and
has disbanded for the year, Rob-
ei-t Hall, president of the organi-
zation, announced recently,

Hall said that the primary pure
pose of the club was to interest
students and faculty in the gov-
ernment training program for
student pilots. Now that the
club has been promised that the
raculty will vote on the course
at the next regular faculty meet-
ing, it can do nothing more until
next fall when it can take an ac-
tive part in organizing the course
if the faculty and administration
approve it.

Therefore, Hall stated, it was
thought advisable to disband un-
til next fall.

Drama Awa rd---

Continued from page 1

Clark Comments.

"It 1 were asked, of the two
remaining plays, to name the
one that shows the most promise,
I would say “The Pardoner's
Tale," in spite of a good deal of
self~conscious Steinbeck and Sar-
oyan imitationa On the other
hand, if I were asked to designate
which was the best as pure thea-
tre, I would choose “It Is Twice
Blast”; this in spite of the con.
ventional idea on which it is
based. Surely this last play comes
nearest being pure theatre . . . .,

FIVe plays were submitted in
the contest, according to Mrs.
Sara Sherman Pryor, director of
drama. Commenting on the qualir
ty of the winning plays, Clark
states: “Incidentally, I may say
that all three of these plays are
far above the average of student
written work that has come to
my attention. I was recently

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

asked to judge six onerncters
written by supposedly advanced
students, and there is not one of
them that can come up to the
least of these."

Mrs. ri-yor's statement,

Mrs. Piyor said last night, “I
am glad that so distinguished and
competent a critic was gracious
enough to act as judge of our
play writing- contest.

“Since the play writing courses
at Grinuell college do not pretend
to make proiossional dramatists
out of undergraduate students,
but do attempt to teach the ele-
ments of dramatic technique as
related to the theatre, I believe
that the basis tor Mr. Clark's
decision was well chosen.”

Miss Whetstone said, “Needless
to say I’m very surprised, but I
am extremely happy about wine
ning the Henry York Steiner mes
morial prize."

The Steiner memorial prizes
this year are being given in the
fields of play writing, art, and
essay writing.
