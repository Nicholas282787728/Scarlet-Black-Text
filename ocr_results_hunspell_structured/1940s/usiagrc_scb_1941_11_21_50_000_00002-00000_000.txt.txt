Friday,

0 Hitler and You.

Say what you will about Hitler, you can’t ignore him any-
more than you can do without your weekly bath.

Mighty as his Nazi armies are, the real threat to you and
me is not to be found in the military armor of the German
Reich. Lurking in the shadows is a much greater {actgthdt
Hitler has succeeded in molding a united Germany with a
living, dynamic ideology.

We grant that this ideology is based on force and brutality.
We grant that the Nazi philosophy militates at the dignity
of the human personality. The fact still remains that the
Nazis have temporarily solved the problem of the individual’s
relation to the state and that most of them seem satisfied.

Shifting our glance to America, What do We see? With
labor strikes cropping up every day, with much inefficiency
bogging down our national defense program, with subversive
elements hard at work in our midst, the problem of the
individual’s responsibility to the state becomes more vital
by the week.

Hitler has his own peculiar answer to the problem. What
is going to be ours?

vConnoisseur ot the Coltture”
Presents Demonstration

.Feminine locks Look on a. sophisticated beauty Thursday, as Mr. Rob-
ert Detohemendy, junior student at Missouri 11., and hair stylist at
Stephens Wielded razor, scissors, and comb with deft fingers on the
Little Theater stage.
C O 0

”his good looking young man, student undcr Antoine in New York
City for five years, is quite different from what the coeds expected in
a. "connoisseur of the colffure”; no sleek black hair and mustache, no
French accent; but just is typical American college man wearing a
casual corduroy suit. (Incidentally, like or lot of you fellas, he's heading
for the army in February.)

IMr. Detchemendy arrived in Grinhcll Wednesday evening, expecting
to see is group of Town cornrfed girls with frowzy locks, but was pleas-
ently surprised to see coeds that could compete with any Stephens‘ or
M. U. girl. He says our hair, in style and texture, is above average;
but We girls had better watch out cosmetics; We’re being criticized beA
cause of our too-light face powder, too-orange Lipstick, and unkempt
eyebrows.

.Scores of questions came from onlookers as Mr. Detchemedy’s flying
fingers created new hair styles. Here arc a few tidbits of information
that I managed to gather while elbowing my way through the throng
which gradually seemed to be closing in on the man. Wash your hair
as often as you like, but get every bit of the shampoo out of it; get'
your curls with a good permanent if you aren’t messed with the real
McCoy, and don't try to pin up curls every night; use a good hoirhrush
daily; try an egg shampoo once in awhile (come see me if you wont
the formula); usc hon-pins instead of bobble pins; and, last but not
least, strictly formal hair styles are out, Stick to your regular onc whcn
you get smoothed up for me approaching houscpnrhcs.

.We're off on a tangent this Week. Kind of wandering away from the
realm of fashion, but remember well groomed hair is essential to o
fashionable personality.
