0 That’s All For Us.

It’s now 3 a. m. Saturda morning, and all-
other staff of the Scarlet and Black, the
seventy-second in the paper’s history, has
put the paper to bed, for the last time
Sleepless Tuesdays and dateless Fridays are
at an end for this administration of the
paper.

This has been a restless year at G nnell.
There have been changes in administration,
changes in student government, ambitious
'plans for a future Grinnell have been paint—
ed, and old, out-moded traditions have been
discarded. It has been an eventful year here,
With the constant change that has taken
place on the campus, it has been more in-
teresting than ever to be given the privilege
to repolt college events. A new curriculum,
building plans, winning football and basket-
ball teams, a revival of the Grinnell spirit,
bigger and better forms of student govern-
ment, the inauguration of a Pilot Training
Course; accounts of these and many more
events may be found in this year’s files of
the paper. All of which have been more
than enjoyable to report, edit and publish.

Next year promises to be fully as vital
as this year, for it will mark the success or
failure of many of these changes about the

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

campus. The new editor will see how tllc
draft is going to affect the colic ' He, too.
is being granted a privile e in being able to
record all that is to happen on campus HEVL'
year,

The next issue of the Scarlet and Black
will be in different hands. At this w 'ting‘,
it cannot be ascertained who the new cditoi
will be, or what policies he will pursue.
All that this administration can do is
wish him all the success ill tlle world, and
may he have as good a time putting out his
Scarlet and Black as we have had putting
out ours,

@Grinnell and Hitler.

One lieeps hearing over and over again how
the delllocracie should be taking a valuable
lesson from the present European crises;
indeed, it is heard so lnuch that everyone is
rightly a little tired of the same old lille.
But the implication is there nevertheless.

Today the German armies roll on relent»
lessly through the Balkans and the rest oi"
Europe. Today their legions are turning; the
tide ill Africa, and are poised to deal the
death blow to England, Tomorrow Hitler
may give the Sign to Turl. y and the oil
fields beyond. All the wllile we sit here,
uncertain as to“what to do. Should we step
ill and gain the victory we must have‘7 Or
just give aid and nothing- more? Or stay
out altogether? No one can answer those
questions However, there are problems
that we cansolve today.

If there is any one thing that has put
Germany ill her present dominant position
it is the ilnity with which her people strive
to attain their goal: they are willing to give
their all to this war, and behind supe ior,
if heastial, leadership, they are winning it.

Unity gained through rigid regulation and
constant supervision is the driving force be—
hind the armies sweeping Europe.

Immediately the question arises, “Are we
to submit to such barbaric practices t0
wrest control from the Nazis?" The answer
is no. But we ill America, we in Grinnell,
can attain the Same results by regulating
ourselves. Let us organize ourselves, direct
our own habits and lives so that no outside
dictatorial force will have to do it for us in
order to get the best results. This is just
as true for Grinnell college as it is for the
United States, This is a serious time we
are in, and as college students we will have
to face it. Let’s be sure there is self-deA
veloped unity with which to face the prob-
lems ahead, not “supervised” unityi

To the Ember
The cancellation of tonight’s Var-
Sity Club dance has brought rea-
lization of the dangerous finan-
cial condition of the organization.
And with the cancellation there
are numerous rumors flying
around the campus to the effect
that those active students who
purchased Varsity tickets are
going to lose their investment.

However, such is not: the case,
The Varsity club fully intends to
give its members lill to which
they are chimed,
mining dances are going to be
held. Some compensation will be
made'to members for tonight’s
lost ileum, This is made possible
through several schemes that we
have for raising money.

This year the Varsity club has
endeavored to build up a reputa-
tion for giving dances. How well
we have succeeded we do not
know, but we certainly are not
going to sacrifice a. year's work
by not meeting our obligations.

The problem is one that has
been growing for several years.
For some time the Varsity club
has experienced a “second semes<
tier slump." We realized this

The two re- ‘

when we began the year, and we
tried to get out of the rut. Every
thing was out from the dances in
order to spend all the money on
music. “'6 gambled on the chance
that a good reputation would
counteract the slump, and we did
not build up a, reserve' for the
second semester. “’e lost,
However, those active students

are not going to be penalized for
the inactivity of the remainder
of the student body. The Varsity
club will meet its obligations,
