GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

_REV|SE VARSITY LINEUP

FOR CLASH W

A drastically revised Grinnell
lineup will take the field against
the Kohawks from Coe here to-
morrow, carrying Pioneer hopes
for the first Scarlet and Black
conference victory of the season.
Coach Ben Dollglzts' starting team
will feature youth, speed, and,
lightness in contrast to the heavy-
weight group which has gotten
the nod heretofore this season.

Manning the wing positions will
be Brunie Vanstrum and fresh-
man Henry Hoopes, who both
looked good last week against
Comell. George Erb will start,
at one tackle, and big Ed Mitch-
ell will continue in his left tack-
le post, as he has all season.

Dick Hebson and Art Wood-
ward, pre-war lettermen, will be
in at the guard spots for the op-
’ ening kickoff, Stewart Rich-
mond, promising freshman, will
have the ball snapping post. Ker-
mit Steinbeck, all season standout
as an elusive ball carrier, will
call signals as usual.

At the halves will be E. G.
Booth, 170 pound sophomore. and
Jack Thellman, fast 155 pound
freshman. Booth saw considerable
action against Cornell for the first
time this year, while Thellman is
untried in varsity competition.

John Ush ma, also a freshman
lightweight, will hold down the
fullback slot, This aggregation ot‘
backs has an average weight of
only 150 pounds, while Grilmell's"
line averages a modest 183‘
pounds.

Grinnell's squad should he at,
more nearly full strength for this
game than at any time since the
beginning of the Season. Only Ev
Sory and Herb White, wingmen,
are still on the injury list, and,
they are henchcd for the season

improved Passing
Brings Lone Score
Againsi' Come“

The Cornell Hilltoppers, in
their homecoming game, walloped
the Pioneers to the tune of 20-6,
last Saturday. in spite of the fact
that Grinnell’s passing attack
really clicked for the first time
tins season.

it was evident that Ben Doug-
las' eleven was out-powered on the
ground, as Cornell marched down
the field in the first quarter, to
climax an 80-yard trip with
touchdown and extra point, With
the Pioneers on the low and, 7-0,
the second period was scoreless,
and it was not until after the half
that Grinnell took to the air.
Brnnie Vanstrum pulled in pass-
cs left and right to no avail, as
the Grinnell rally was spiked.

Then, as McGrane was hit hard
and fumbled the return of a Cor-
nell punt, the Purple recovered
and began a downfield roll which
ended with Jacot tallying Cor-
hell's, second score. The touch-
down pass caromed off two play-
ers and into his arms in the end
zone, The conversion failed, and
the score stood 13-0 in Cornell's
favor.

A poor Crinnell punt set up
the third touchdown for their op-
ponents, when the Hilltoppers took

ithe ball on the Pioneers‘ 44, and.

just five plays later, Raga skip

 

Poweriul Langan
Tops League

The running and passing of
Glenn Saunders sparked a hard-
hitting Langan team to a zs-si
i-ictory over Rawson Wednesday,
on MacEachron field, and helped
garner the intramural football
Championship for Langan.

The breaks piled up against
Tooth Hammond's boys in the sec-
ond quarter, when two of Max
Bacon’s passes were intercepted,
and another was called back.
Langan racked up two more
touchdowns in that period, one on
a pass to Bob Harness, the other
on one to sticky-fingered Paul
Gustafson. Gene Clement drop-
kicked the conversion for the
second score, lcaviiig Rawson on
the low end of a 19-0 score

Rawson madc a sudden thrust,
however, in the third quarter,
when, after Langan attempted to
ruiit the return of the kick-off,
Max Bacon completed four ’fast

ped across for the tally, and Kos-
lowski kicked his second extra
point, putting Grinnell behind
20-0.

With four minutes left in the
last quarter, the Pioneers began
to click. Fred Webb connected
with Mel White. then Webb took
another pass from Steinbeck, to
put the ball 28 yards from the
Cornell goal. A pass to Van-
strum was ruled complete, to put
the Pioneers on the 2-yard line,
and two plays later, Kermit Stein-
hock pushed over Grinlleil‘s lone
touchdown. The Pioneers failed
to convert, leaving the final score
at 20-6.

passes to Gene Boat, the last of
which was in the end zone. The
try for point was no good. The
score stayed at 19-6 until the
closing minutes of the game, when
a pass was completed from Saun-
ders to Ed Rissien. The final

yscoxo was 25-6.

Rawson-Cowles

Rawson had defeated Cowles,
17-7, on Monday, and if Rawsunl
had won over Langan, a play-off
of a three-way tie for first would
have been necessary, among Dib-
bie, Rawson, and Langan, Final
standings were as follows: Lan-
gan, Dibble, Rawson, Gates.
Smith, Clark, and Cowles.
