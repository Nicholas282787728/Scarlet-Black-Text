The Au’romobile Age - -

in the past week, a great deal of con»
fusion has arisen over the automobile, and
its implications in the life of the Grinnell
student. The college rule book states clearly
and specifically that no student is to ride
in one of the above mentioned four»wheeled
vehicles for social purposes unless he has
received permission from the Dean, or un-
less the automobile belongs to a member of
his immediate family. This rule applies to
both men and women.

Each student automatically agrees to
conform to this’rule when he enters G_rinnell.
It is a rule, which, if he does not care to
follow, he may waive by going elsewhere
Otherwise, he is to obey it.

The automobile rule is valuable in imple-
menting the democratic spirit which Grin-
nell wishes to maintain. Administrators at
Grinnell have seen too many examples, in

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

other institutions, of the student who is
lucky enough to have a car becoming ele-
vated beyond his true worth because of his
possession, and of other worthy students
who -were neglected simply because they
could not afford a car. It is a case of
legislation limiting a few for the benefit of:
many. Whether or not Grinnell has prod
gressed to a stage of democracy in which
ownership of an automobile would be no
criterion of popula‘ity, we do not venture to
say. In our opinion, it would be useless to
ask for a change in the rule

We do, however, think that enforcement
of the rule should be clarified, and penalties
for violation modifiedl Neither in the
League Board constitution or in that of the
C of HP is there any reference to the rule,
or to the penalties to be imposed. It is a
college rule, whatever that is, with college-
imposed penalties. Yet in a recent viola-
tion, student bodies named the penalties.

The penalties imposed by the students
were more lenient than that of suspension
which is attached to a violation in the
college rule book. This is as it should bell
We would suggest that League Board and
C of HP constitutions be ammended to in-
clude the car rule and to specify the penal-
ty. And let‘s not make it such a foolish
penalty as suspension. Suspension merely
piles upon the student a lot of work to make
up, hits him in his grade point, and accom-
plishes nothing constructive. While a fine
may be hard upon his pocket book, it does
not subtract from that which this college
is here to add—education.

Grapes of Wrath - -

The grape vine speaks again. We hear,
among its leaves, murmurings to the effect
that the Cellar is littered unto repulsive-
ness, and that if it does not soon unlitter
itself, it will become a cellar again instead
of The Cellar.

Maybe we’d miss the grill (Pardon us,
Moon . . . the Century Room) and the juke
box and even pool and bridge. If so, we’d
better wise up and put the cigarettes in
the ash trays and quit building fires in
dark corners and playing soccer (or is it
)‘l-lg‘by?) down the center aisle.

Dear Editor:
Why do we drive on the
meeting cars? One the left in

right side of the street in
passing? But naturally, you

say, we know the answer to that one!

To us as members of the
library shaft the question of open
stacks poses a. similar problem.
Our surprise is that anyone
shculd infer that student help is
needed only to give directions as
indicated in the article in the
March 16 s m B.

Present policies governing the
library are those carefully work-l
ed out by the librarian and the‘
general administration in the
best interests of the students:
They have in some instances even
been in response to student re-
quests thn such requests have
been deemed wise. they have
been adopted.

The library staff greatly ad—
mircs the present student body,
We feel that you have the quali-
ties for scholarship and leader-
ship. Believe us, we are foi- you
100%, Our one desire is to give
adequate service, so that you
may attain the goals you have
set for yourselves. Your prob-
lems are ours. All we ask is
that you trust us to work with
you to the advantage of the Stu-
dent body as a whole.

Our answer to last week‘s
question is to ask another, name-
ly, would it be advisable to turn
several hundred students loose in
the stacks containing more than
one hundred thousand books?
You say it would be less work7

misplaced books to say nothing

So 1 get curious. Where. 1 ask
myself, do those books come
from, the wrong ones the li-
brarian brings me? So I slink
around the big libe. and can find
no answer except maybe behind
a big iron-bound door. It must
be a secret room, or e. torture
chamber or something to do with
pancakes STACKS CLOSED, it
says on the big formidable door.
So 1 says to myself, am I a
mouse or is man? I’ve got a.
mission in do, and so 1 back up
and charge at the door. I pick
myself up just as I realize the
door wasn't bolted at all, but. you
just have to turn the knob and
walk in.

Gosh, look at the books! Row:
and rows of shelves, just crammed
with books. so I say to myself,
son, you've found the secret.
Pretty soon I find a sign saying
where I can find books on each
subject. I wander around, and
gosh, here's a whole section of
books on English lit, the course
I got the NC in, so I begin pull-
ing down books. I find all the
wrong ones, but after while I
find some right ones, and I say to
myself, you could have done all
right if you'd known about this

In the words of Doc Sam, "Ah,

spring in Iowa. There’s nothing
so heartwarming. Also we might
add, feet-wettmg, but unit's
neither here nor there. However,
there are definite signs of spring
—of!icially here yesterdayisuch
as crocuses on the south side of
Herrick Chapel. And also we
might mention the Clark and
Rawson boys trying to kill each
other with golf balls and base~
balls cleverly aimed so as to mis-
lead one into thinking they are
having a rousing afternoon of
sports. But on to pleasanter
things . . .
Bill Findley and Gen-y Wan-cu
. have finally given up playing
their game of “buddies" and are
really rather firmly attached to
each other~by way of Bill's
Honor G pin. Congmts, kids.

We are seriously thinking of
running a lottery on who‘s going
to be Victor in this battle of the
mighty mights, namely S. Norton
B. Eel-Log, and man-anthill,
Smitty.

Oui- weekly bouquet of orchids
(why orchids, anyway? Dande»
lions would do. Oh, well . . . )
goes to Bev Burd, another Wee
one from Haines, who has ram-lei
neatly accomplished the impossible
by getting Stubbee out of that
plaid shirt and into a suit and
shirt—and‘tie, no less!

Naturally we hate to be mon-
gering rumors but someone fold
us, and you can take lt'fcr what
it's worth, that there is going to
he a chaperone in the Rec Room,
shortly. Can’t see what difference
it’ll make, though. Al: least not
in our opinioniit’s almost Arbor
Lake time and there is one big
place to keep an eye on.

,We.weve a Lender adieu to the
Frey-Gradient combo which is def-
initely on 'it's last legs. However,
we wouldn't be a shade surprised
‘to see Toni Bricse move in an
that territory in short order.
Spring brings sucn drastic
Changes . . . '

And so we leave you wiui these
last fond words: The spring is
lovely, we adore blanket parties
and me birds twittering and all.
but does anyone know where we
can buy a box of Kleenex?

(Ad. Note: We and glad to have
me view of the Library staff on
this matter. We are sure that
they have the interest of the
students in mind. We wonder
however, if they win consider the
facts so lighty but accurately
presented in the following com-
munique inysberiously presented
Inst midnight by a. airﬁel- pigeon.)

rm no scholar, see? But
sometimes the professor scys get
this report, you'll find the re-
[erence material in the libe. So
I think well, they told us hcw to
do it when we were preps. It’s
easy, you just fill out a pink slip
and the librarian gets you the
book.

So I fill out some slips. How
do I know they are the right
books? I don’t, but muse mys-
tericus numbers look mighty im-
pressive, So I fill out some
slips, and the librarian gets the
books and I say Thanks. But
these ain’t me ones. So fill out
some more slips, and she says
you can never tell, you just have
to hope. I say rm sorry but
these aren't the ones either. and
she says she’s sorry, but there
is something she must do in the
back room. Sc 1 say to myself
where am I? I figure out the
