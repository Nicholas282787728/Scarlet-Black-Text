Keep [1' Clean - -

“Cleanliness is next to Godliness,’ says
an old proverb, and you all kllow how the
Dutch are admired for their cleanliness.
Now, we don't expect to see the co-eds
scrubbing the streets, but something must
he done with the pile of litter in front of
ARH. Cigarette butts, empty packs, empty
books of matches, old tests, and discarded
S & B’s are unsightly, unsanitary, and un-
necessary. Whether the college is having
visitors or not is beside the point; we live
here, and it is up to us to keep the campus
'looking decent. Wastebaskets are provided
in each class room for unpleasant tests, the
book store has a large bin for empty cig-
arette packs and books of matches

Let There Be Ligh+ -'-

Our eyes are our most priceless pos-
session. This fact has been drilled into our
heads since we were in the first grade. It
is a well knoun fact that in order to read

 

and study well we should have adequate,
light, In order to provide this Source of good
light we go down town and spend our own
money to buy a fluorescent light or some
similar reading lamp. Now we have a good
lamp to study by in our rooms. Tl at's fine;
we are commended for our initiative and
told \\e are taking a step in the right dirr
ection.

We finish breakfast and leave our well
lighted rooms and go to the ARH on a dark,
cloudy day like Wednesday or Thursday.
What happens then. We stumble throughl
the dal halls and literally fall into the;
dimly lighted class rooms. A few wisps ofl
light filter through the windows; the pro—3
fessor gets up from his chair and switches
on the lights. “There, that’s better,” he says,
as he gropes his way through the gloom,
back to his desk. “As I was saying, Grinnell
is celebrating its centennial this year.”

A voice from the rear of the room pipes
up, "Sir, it seems to me that all of us are
quite anal‘e that this is the college‘s 100th,
anniversary, but we would like to know why
they are still using the same lights which
we're used when the school was founded in
1846. I realize that these lights are not 100
years old, but for all practical purposes they‘
are. Certainly a Sclioolavliich has prided
itself on its progress, as Gllnnell has, should l
be able to find more efficient methods of
lighting, I suppose it is the same old etc
the budget only allows so much for this”
the budget only allows so much for that. It‘
is a mystery to me, and I suppose to other
students, that if the college, in its profound
wisdom, deems it necessary to spend $3,000
for a centennial play, it could surely find al
comparable sum for something more lasting; ‘
modern lights, for example.” ,

The student nervously fingered a pencil l
and then continued, “This is not a foolishl
complaint, but one which has a sound basis,‘
This would be an improvement ‘for all, sturl
dents and faculty alike.” With a flourish of‘
his hand, the student sat down, 1

The professor coughed and cleared hisl
throat; ”Please turn to page 346 and we willl
continue.” With this, the class resumed itsl
normal routine. ‘
