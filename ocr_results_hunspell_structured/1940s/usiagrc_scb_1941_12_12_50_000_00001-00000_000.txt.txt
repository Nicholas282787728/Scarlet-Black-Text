“I’m a Dog
Says
Editor Bates

Task of Taking
Picture Brings
Unchrislian Annoyance

I feel like a dog, I really do. I
am humble and broken because I
have allowed myself the Lin—Christ
tian sentiment of irritation.

It began Wednesday when I
planned to have a picture of five
girls at the quadrangle taken for
publication in a state paper.

- I did wrong.
,That is what
bites like iron in
my soul,

My tale be-
gins with a
ruling of tlle
college which
has been in-
voked recently
by Pres. Sam-

> uel N. Stevens.
It is a logical
and valllable

ruling, I like it.

It read No one shall he allow-
ed to take pictures in the dormi»
tories and the quadrangle with
out permission being granted by
the publicity office, or Pres.
Samuel N. sterens.

It is now being put into effect
following a series of pictures in
the Des Moines Tribune of which
the administration dissapproved.

It was in trying to carry out
this ruling that I went wrong.

I called Cal Deming, college
publicity mogul, at his ofhcc.

He was out.

I called D. Stevens at his of»
fice.

He was out.

I called Cal Deming at his
llolne. He was out. I called
Dr. Stevens at his home. He
wasn’t there I had planned
the picture for that after-
noon. I changed my plans,
reali.ng that administration
duties are rl id and requir-
ing.

I was optomistic, and I felt at
peace, for I was doing my duty.

After supper, I called Dr. Stev-
ens at his home, and learned that
he was at the men's dining room.

Hope ‘Welled up in my breast.
I called the dining room. No one
answered.

I called the dorm kitchen,
Someone said, “hello." I was elat-
ed. I was really getting some-
where now. Thc “hello" was
cheery and ‘full of human kind4
ness. This. I felt, is sheer ectasy.

I said "hello,” feeling in ac-
cord With the human race.

Then I remembered my picture
of fire coeds “hich I had planned

"War Speeches Slay The
Same,” David Phillips Tells Club

Basic ideas Behind
Arguments Don't Change,
Speech Instrucl‘or Says

“The speeches made 2,000

years ago contain the same

message that national leaders

are giving us today," David

C. Phillips, instructor in

speech, declared recently in a
talk before a local club.

The basic idea that made people

laugh or cry 200 years ago still

. - effects them in

. the same manner

today. The argu~

ments that were

used to arouse

people to action

2000 years ago

still are used to

touch them in

, , the present era.

“ ‘But if we

leave these men

too in the lurch.

and then Eng-

land is crushed by Hitler, tell me
what is to prevent him from
marching just were he pleases.
Everyone in this audience has
seen the gradual steps used by
Hitler in his march for power.
First he seized Austria, next
Czechoslovakia, then Norway, and
after that the Balkans. He is
tacked France, and lastly Russ .
He’s settled in countries just as
he pleased}

“We might guess," Phillips
said. “that the author of this
speech was Secretary Knox, Wil-
kie, or Stimson, or even Pre .
dent Roosevelt himself. In reality,
it is part of a speech given by a
Greek named Demosthenes in 349
B. (5. Modern names have been
substituted for the names of
Philip of Macedonia and the coun-
tries he conquered, but the mes
sage is just the some.
“Demosthenes rakes Philip over
the coals with, ‘our chier ground
