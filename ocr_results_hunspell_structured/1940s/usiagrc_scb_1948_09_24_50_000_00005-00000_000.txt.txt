Grinnell Seal Seeks
To Portray History,
Tradition Of College

In a week flooded with college,
catalogs, rules and regulations, and‘
pamphlets and infinitum, many a
student old as well as new began
to wonder what it all meant,

For the rambling pages of col-
lege history, the lofty phraseings
of the college's goals, and the

puzzling allusions to Iowa college
and Congregational founders, a
campus researcher has found a
concise summary, the college seal.

Adorning most official college
paper work, the seal itself is a five
point outline for understanding the
history and the meaning of the
college itself.

The seal has the Latin words
for both Iowa College and Grin—
nell, since Grinnell college was
originally named Iowa college and
our board of trustees is still named
the Trustees of Iowa college.

In the center of the seal appearI
the Roman numerals for 1846, the
year which the cllege was found-
ed: the Latin inscription which

means “With Christ as lcader:"i'

and the Greek inscription which'
literally translated means "The
truth will make you free,” The in-
scription is in Greek because it is
a quotation from the New testa-
ment which was written in Greek;
originally.

And, finally, the book in the
center of the seal is a symbol of
knowledge or learning.

of Arts, 15 oils by Marsden Hart-
ley, 20 paintings by west coast
artists, water ,colors by members
of the National Association of Wo—
men Artists, an annual exhibition
by Grinnell students, and an an-
nual art department open house.
Tentatively scheduled are a fat:-
ulty exhibition, a camera club ex-
hibition, and a group of 30 seri—
graphs or silk screen prints.
