Retreat

An annual institution in every
Catholic college is the Retreat, so
drilled because the student engages
in a period ol serious 'eontemplas
tion, keeping strict silence lor three
days. Dining that time he considers
his past moral misbehavior and ways
of amznding his life.

Under the guidance of a Retreat
Master, who gives the students four
instructions a day, the Collegian
thinks about why he is here on
earth, whcncc he is going alter
death, and his relationship to his
Creator.
