Dyer-Bennei's Reperioire

Oldest College Newpdper
Wesi of the Mississippi River

Richard Dyer—Bennet, 20th century minstrel, will bring a pro-
gram of ballads and folk songs to the high school auditorium
Thursday at 8 p.m. Admission will be by semiee, activity ticket,

or season ticket.

The Englishzbol'n tenor accompanies himself on the guitar. He
declares that the guitar “is a much more practical instrument"
than the harp of the old—time minstrel.

His program varies from a
16th century aria to a song of
the Australian bush country.
from the song of victory sung
by the conquering English sol-
diers after the battle of Agin-
court in 1415 to the “Waltzing
Matilda" of the Australian troops
in the second world war.

When Dyer~Bennet visited
Sven Scholander in Sweden, the
master of European folk music
gave him the words and music
to songs popular centuries ago
in Germany, Sweden, and
France. These songs were the
first Dyer-Bennet sang to Amer-
ican audiences, and some will be
included in his program ThurSv
day night.

Discusses Social Ac
By Kay Swartz

The new student co-ordinatillg committee which will try to in»i
crease the scope 0i social activities on campus met for the first K
time Tuesday afternoon to discuss the problems of providing more

recreation.

The group, organized under
the Students Council charter, is
headed by Frank Sanders and
includes Larry Young, men’s
social‘ chairman; Barbara Mce
Conihc, women’s social chair-
man; and Andy Schiil, Gade
abouts manager. A topic of dis
cussion was a plan to schedule
one hour functions about three
times a week which would not
require more than sixty people
to be successful.

Social Organizer

On being interviewed about
lack of recreation space since
the rec roomekitchen Change,
Schill noted the possibilities of
making more use of the Union,
This he thought could be ac-
complished through a student
social organizer who would be
paid to put over a roundedeout
social program in which events
would be scheduled all week,
The organizer, who would re~
ceive rank on the social com-
mittee, could make use of ARH,
the Union, the pool, or any other
of the campus buildings, Schill
said.

The lack of recreation oppor-
tunity was to be taken up in
the social committee meeting
this afternoon.

Must Move Slowly

When Dean Gardner was ques»
tioncd on the loss of the rec
room, she stressed the fact that
two additional areas were pro-
vided the year it was removed:
the Union and Loose hall lounge.
The reason, she said, that Loose
had not been opened for full-

manner of the nlinstr‘cls of old
Europe. Reviving ‘a tradition
over six centuries old, his
school of minstrelsy in Aspen,
Colo, trains students in the arts
of poetry, singing. and self ac-
companiment on the Spanish
guitar.

,time use is because it is better
to be sure the privilege will not
be abused before granting it, “We
must move slowly or we have
to disappoint too many people
when it is necessary to take
something away,” she mentions
ed. She did not think it advise
able to open the recreation
,rooms in the basements of var-
ious halls for nosed activities.

Student handling is the an»
swer to the problem, in the
opinion of Miss Pauline Hunter,
iHaines cottage hostess, and an
experienced worker in the recrer
ation ﬁeld. “I don’t think recs
reation imposed by authority
continues to be recreation any
more," she declared and went on
to say that a student committee
,ineeting with interested faculty
members could plan aplace wrth
.a little atmosphere to smoke,
idance to a juke box, play ping»
pong and have a coke machine
iavailable. Lack of these things,
she noted, are not conducive to
recreation. In addition, she said,
the Union is inadequate for the
number needing this type of
place.

Centralization Necessary

Miss Doris Brockman, James
cottage hostess, said, ”I think it's
an important thing for the Col—
lege to keep their students sat-
isfied on,campus," She suggest-
ed a combined study and recre-
ation lounge which would bc
more central and casual than
the James basement. She thought
