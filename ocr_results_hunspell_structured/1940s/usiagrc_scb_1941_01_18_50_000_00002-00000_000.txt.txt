So You Don’t Like Changes

There has been a growing interest on cams
pus toward the new cur culum changes
ever since its presentation in the extra edi—
52%] of the Scarlet and Black last December

There have been several objections to
these changes, all of which are causing no

through the last issue of the Scar-
let and Block that our
sentatives," having completed the

OPEN FORUM

little uneasiness and general confusion in
tile minds of the students.

Few of these objections are against the
changes in themselves.

That which is actually provoking the
greatest concern is the alleged impetuosity
of those who promote the new changes in
the cm lculum.

It is true that some changes have already
been made with astonishing rapidity, too
astonishing and too rapid to be easily un-
derstood and absorbed by our more “level-
headed” friends. These people favor a slow-
er movement, a gradual evolution. But it is
a sad fact that obstinaincy is frequently
practiced as caution. Suffice it to say that
if the necessary changes are to be made
consciously and not passively awaited, we
must both expect and accept a certain
amount of disorder.

Also, many students who register disap-
proval do so because they fear a violent dis-
ruption in their own college careers. Al—
though fear is eminently a sign of ignor-
ance, this objection is somewhat justified.
If the transition to the new curricular sys»
tem should cause a serious disarrangement
in the plans of some student, it is exceed-
ingly regrettable and something should be
done about it. But such cases should be the
exception rather than the rule, because the
greater part of the plan has been expressly
designed to make any extreme pers'onal re-
adjustments unnecessary.

Any student who will take the trouble to
review the proposed plans as they have been
repeatedly publicized will find that very
probably in his own case there is provision
for a fairly satisfactory adjustment.

In Some Schools

' Gambling Has Become Class Subject

(By Associated Colle late Press»

The player's chance of being dealt a straight flush In a poker
game is only one in 64,974 times (if the dock isn't stacked).

And the chance of getting 13 spades in one hand in bridge is
but one in 700 trillion times, however many that is.

so figures on Eastern New Mexico college Pit, D,, professor
in mathematics, followmg a Dartmouth professor's use in his class
of chances in a crapsshooting' session,

Intrigued by the utilization of homely happenings in higher
mathematics, the ENMC professor fascinated his students with
problems dealing with bridge, poker, and slot machines, with the
slot machines for once coming out at the losing end.

For students found that the slot machine offers a sure chance
to lose money.

slot machines usually afford one chance in eight of winning on
any given play, but because human beings like to gamble and or»
dinarily continue to play their winnings back, they apparently have
only about one chance in 100 of coming out ahead, said the pro-
fessor. .

There are 24,480,ooo,ooo,ooo possible combinations in a regular
52rcard deck, the goggle-eyed students learned

in poker there is but one chancc in 4,165 deals of getting four
of a kind, one in 694 of getting a rull housc, one in 509 of getting
a flush, one in 41 of getting three of a hind.

What started it all was the Dartmouth pl‘oﬁessor's problem in
crapsshootings: The caster rolls two dice and wins if (a) the sum
be 7 or 11; (b) if the sum be 4, 5, 6, 3, 9 or 10 and of this same
sum reappears before seven is ever seen To obviate the odds
against the caster, a dishonest caster employs two dice, one true
and the other loaded so that a certain number always appears at
the top. What should this number he in order to give him the
maximum advantage?

 

 

 

It would seem sensible to ad-
mit that most Grinnellians are in~
s llod with the American demo—
crntie heritage. This heritage chr-
ries with it it touch of anarchy,
and somewhat the belief thatany
kind of government is a neces—
sary en'l that does not ileimind
cooperation to the extent of “(at-
iling." Americans have olivnys
been a little suspicious of the law.
After all, most of our forefathers
left Europe because of some
brush with the local authorities

Perhaps it is incongruous, but
most Grinnellians do not crib and
never will, and it is against their
code to report cheaters.
