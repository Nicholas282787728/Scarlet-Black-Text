OPEN FORUM

To the Editor:

How do we have the right to ex-
ercise our traditions and group
activities during this war unless
we first assist those who are
fighting for the maintenance of a
true democratic spirit?

We talk glibely of German sur»
render from day to day, yet while
the battle of the Rhine needs all
our attention and support, we
think in terms of spending cot-
tage funds for trivial accessories
as would improve hall spirit.

The war is NOT won yet, and
even a small impediment to its
total effort might cause delay
in its fulfilment.

We MUST continue to whole-
heartedly support such activities
as he Red Cross, war Loan
Drives, and other community and
national war fund drives, Fifty
dollars goes a longer way when
diverted from a local interest to
an international cause in which
everyone of us is concerned. Let
us not expect victory served to
us with all the trimmings. We
must work for it.

Brown Speaks of
Party Platforms
ToSeminarGroup

Post war seminar, under the
sponsorship of Dr, Neal w. Klaus-
uer, held its first meeting of the
year Tuesday evening, according
to Virginia Johnston, president.

It was decided, since the coming
presidential election is the only
one the members will see during
their college careers, that the club
programs should be aimed at un-
derstanding, rather than trying to
solve major election issues.

At the next meeting, Tuesday,
October 3, Dr. Stuart Gerry
Brown, professor of English, will
present a brief condensation of
what he considers to be the out»
standing points of both platforms.

on October 10. the problems of
reconversion, mainly of war in»
dustries, Will be brought up. Such
topics as big business, little bus»
iness, and social security will be
discussed.

"Why did I ever come back? Whyi
didn’t I get married?” The un-
happy senior girl flung herself
onto her bed and her tears polka»
dotted the pink organdy bed-
spread.

“Why didn't I get married? He
could have married me anyhow,
even if he didn't like the way I
looked at breakfast."

And how did our dear dis-
traught damsel look at breakfast?
Just like the 323 other girls who,
wander around the quad. Let's
take a look at a nice bright and
shiny Grinnell breakfast. That
is, if you can stand it.

Did I say it was a nice bright
and shiny morning . . . Well, I
mean it literally. There they are,
324. bright shiny noses. A tidal
wave of blue jeans, beneath which
masculine plaid and striped pa-
jamas (they just didn't have’ time
to change) are discreetly conceal.
ed, roars down the hall white cap»
ped with pallid faces. Without
looking at the feet it is often dif-
ficult to tell whether a gn'ven
creature is walking from you or
towards you. There is hair dang-
ling on all four sides of her head
and a sloppy black and red plaid
flannel shirt camouflages any
betrayal of those “pm-up git”
features of modern American
girls.

This peek-a-boo hair style plays
havoc at the breakfast table it-
self. While one girl is tossing
her head to and fro to get her
hair out of the way of her mouth
so she can wedge a piece of toast
(let me look again, is that really
toast?) between her lips, a long
hair, be it blonde or brunette,
splatters into a nearby glass of
milk. Which reminds me, if we

could take the liberty of calling
lipstick intoxicating, that must
be the hangover of the night be-
fore lingering on the lips of the
girls the next morning. How
weird! But back to hair, Those
girls who are decent enough not
to cloak their unpainted faces in
the reams of their hair go to the
opposite extreme and just knot
it all up in a great big bandahna.
These bandahnas advertise the
fact “that I just didn't have time
to comb it out . . . my roommate
overslept, we were so-o-o-o. tir—
ed."

So there they are 1' ing in, in
blue jeans and sloppy shirts, with
either cascades of hair cloaking
their faces or knots of hair ex<
posing them. Oh, yes, the faces.
In the first place they’re a ghuta
ly white, "Mabel, I couldn't find
Max Factor tan number two this
morning. What am I going to
do? I'll bet I look like a. zom-
bie." Well, sister. you do, . . . .
but definitely. Then there are
those lips suffering from the
hangover I mentioned before. The
eyes are sort of set off by blur»
red lines of yesterday's eyebrow
pencil that was halfway washed
off in the morning shower.

So there they are with half a
face on and half a face of: . . . .
better would it be if all were
off.

And then they wonder why they
didn’t get married!
