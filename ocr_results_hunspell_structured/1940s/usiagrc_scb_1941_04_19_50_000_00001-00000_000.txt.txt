Pearce Goes
To Carleton

Will Investigate the
Carlelon Social Plan
in Relation +0 Grinnell

Kenet Pearce, Clark hall president,
is stopping at Carleton college,
Northfield, Minnesota, this week-
end. The purpose behind this stay
at the Midwest Conference school
is to study the Carleton Plan, ac-
cording to Pearce,

This move originated out of the
recent cancellation of varsities
due to lack of funds.

Pearce has already made a pre~
liminary study of the plan, under
which each student pays 34 a
year into a general entertainment
fund. From this fund the stu-
dents get dances, date dinners,
and movies, all at no extra cost
beyond the original $4.

The fund is divided so that on
one Saturday night, there is a
dance, on another, a movie, and
on a third. a date dinner. Pearce
intends to investigate more thor—
oughly the workings of the plan
to see how they could be applied
to Grinnell college, he said.

SDX to Fight Name Band Rage; Signs Tommy Douglas

Scribes to Lead
College Down Path
Of Social Obscurity

By William Buckley.

The Crinnell chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi, men's professional
journalistic fraternity, has made
up its mind, according to Thorn
Kuhl, president.

“There have been too many
name bands on the campus this
year," Kuhl claimed, "and Sigma
Delta Chi has mken upon itself
to rid the school of this curse of
the social committee."

“Lf Grinnell is to become so
cially obscure, let the scribes of
he the first to lead thc way," he
asserted.

With these preliminaries, Kuhl
announced the signing of Tommy

Douglas and his orchestra a ten
piece colored orchestra hailing
from some place south of die
Mason-Dixon line to play for the
thirteenth annual Brown Derby
Drag to be held Saturday May 3
in the gymnasium.

The dance this year will feature,
besides the Douglas band, the
annual presentation of awards;
the Grinnell Black and Blue, cam-
pus razz sheet; and a new show,
”My Nightmare and I,” patterned
after "Me and My Nightmare,"
which was presented last year at
the dance,

Awards to be presented this
year will include the Brown Derby
to go to the senior man who has
gotten through school with the
least work and the best grades;
the Brown Bonnet to the senior
Women who can boast the same

honor; the Leather Medal to me
man having the longest line; the
Kite to the women with the simis
lar attribute: the Doves to the
most Simon-pure couple on cam»
pus; the Rabbits to the most not.
quite-sosSimOn-pure couple on the
campus; and the Pillow and
Blanket.

He also asserted that it would
cost students more not to go to
the Brown Derby than to go to the
affair. "Look,” he said. "The
dance is informal. Therefore no
cleaning and pressing of a tuxedo.
Chalk up one buck to personal
sa rigs"

‘Then,’ he asserted, "there are
no corsages. That makes another
buck you save, or a total of two
bucks. With tickets costing only
