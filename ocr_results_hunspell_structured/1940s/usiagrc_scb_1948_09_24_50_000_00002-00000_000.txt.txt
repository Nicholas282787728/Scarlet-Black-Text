Pair Trouble

We'd like to ask about this year's "pair"

eliminate “twosies” from daterdinners, you
ask? We’d like to pop the question to those
dateless girls wllo have to stroll uiiescorted

dine in male company: Would you like to
participate in the interchange of table talk,
too? How about “blind-date” dinners‘,l
We’d like to see dinners on both sides of

so. It could be that the darkened rooms

Let’s brighten our campus this year for
a bigger “pair"crop. Let‘s give us all a

Guest Editorial

Anyone who has talked with lls about
Hampton knows of our great enthusiasm
for the exchange program and of the en-
ioyable time we spent there, However,
there were some aspects of our experiences
that we did not like,

We could not sit together on busses
with our Negro roommates with whom we
ate, with whom we lived, and with \vhom
we studied.

We were not too happy after planning
a picnic when it had to be cancelled because
of the Vir 'nia system of separate beaches
for people with different colored skins.

We will not forget the people on the
streets who stopped to stare nmazedly as
we walked with our friends down the
streets of Hampton

It did not seem right when we wor-
shipped in churches where Negros were not
allowed. "e \\ ill not forget the executive of
a fishing industry who called Betty a
“damyankee” and left the room—when he
learned she was living at Hamptonion the
grounds that she was “interfering with the
‘Southerner's Problem’l“

And finally, when we did violate the
segregation laws, we disliked the stuffy
theatre balconies and the Jim Crow waiting
rooms. We disliked being ordered out of
“white restaurants” for taking our colored
friends along

We shall never forget the good times
and ollr many new friends at Hampton. It
is good to be back, however, at Grinnell

wllere_racial intolerance and discrimination,_

to all outward appearances, do not exist.

Johnny Long's “JUST L'IKE THAT”—
from the Signature diskerie.

Johnny Long (Dulce University—Sigma Nu) comes up
with a danceable, bright bounce. It's a Long original!
If you should ask Johnny how he came to write it, he’ll light
up a Camel and say: “Experience! I know from
experience what music suits my band best—
just as I learned from experience that Camels
suit my ‘T-Zonc’ to :l ‘T’."
Try Camels on your “T-Zone”—“T” {or taste,
“T” for throat. See for yourself why, will]
Johnrly Long and millions of other smokers,
Camels are the “choice of experience.”
