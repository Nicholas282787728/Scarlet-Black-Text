‘ the Visitors’ Don Armstrong began

the march for individual scoring
honors for the cvening. He hit
:17 points to lead the Monmouth

ment served to nail the Scarlet

little out of their reach.

The entire Illinois club began to
hit flum near and far as they
turned the last ten minutes into
a rout. With four turns of the
clock remaining, Monmouth led
- 743, and, as-both coaches sub-
