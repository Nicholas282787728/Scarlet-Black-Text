Dibble .400 The 1941 Grinneli homecoming
Smith Amy does have its depressing side,
Town Men .000 Gerald Grant, leader of the letterv
men, admitted toady.

Some of the replies to the alum-
ni Honor G stag dinner invite
tions have been coming in from
former Grinnell athletes who are
now in Uncle Sam’s military ser-
vice.

WELCOME
Back To Old
Grinnell

Most of those reply cards bear
a weak check mark in the “I'm
sorry as Hell" column, Grant said

Many of the G-mell-turnedr
soldiers went as far as to tell
what defense stations they would
be holding down on homecoming
day

A great desire to attend on the
part of California and west coast
alumni was also evidenced in the
replies, Grant stated.

At the dinner, R. A, Hawk,
toastmaster, will introduce five
speakers, each of whom, in turn,
will give a toast in honor of
Grinnell football highlights of the
decade which he represents,

The speakers are J, B, Grinnell,
representing the decade 18907
1900; Dr. Claw, 190071910; Fred
Little, 1910-1920; Gordon Meeter,
19201930; and Oscar Christoph-
ei-son, who will represent the
1930—1940 period.

Eddie May Is out
Of Lineup; Blue
Devils' Hopes.Sag

with backfield ace Eddie May on
the sidelines Beloit’s victory
hopes are at low ebh despite last
weeks 12 to a Victory over Knox.
This was the first dip into the
conference-win column for the
Blue Devds this season.

Gl'innellittlls who saw the Home-
coming game two years ago, have-
n't forgotten how Beloit, sparked
by May, came from behind 19 to
0 in the last half to win 26 to 19.

Two sophomores scored the
winning points against Knox.
John Honnifan ran 21 yards for
a touchdown while Bill carver
went 71 yards to pay dirt.

In the line the Blue Devils are
sparked by Co-eoptains Reggie
French, guard, and Bill cnnti-
wick, center. Both were picked on
last year’s all-conference second
teaml

Tomorrow's meeting will be the
fifth between Grinnell and Beloit.
In 1915 Grinnell won 23 to o and
again the next year 23 to u. The
two teams didn't meet again until
1939 when the Blue Devils won
25 to 19. They repeated last year
with a s to 0 win.
