MANPOWER IN PHYSICS

The story of manpower in the
rield ot physics is not a happy
one. Todty there are too iew men
and women in this field to pro-
vide physics training for Army
and Navy personnel. war re
search and war production. Andi
every physicist called upon today
ior some new service must boi
pulled from e iob where he is al~
ready desperately needed.

These facts were reveadel this

week by Drr Herman Briscoc.i
Chiet ot’ the Pl'orcssional and
Technical Training Division ct

the War Manpower Commission.

To back up his statements, D
Briscoe cited a survey_matle dur-
ing March of last year by the U.
3. Employment Serwice This Sul-
vcy covercd’some 15,000 l'ncluslel
rues directly related In whole 0|
in part to the production or war
materials. The survey also 0177
tamed an estimate of the d
mands of these firms for techni-
cal personnel during the Six
months period from AIRTCII to
September oi last year.

For that period, Lhcsc indus-
tries reported their estimaied
needs to be 539 physicists This
Was In addition L0 the 1,80; phy-

 

 

    

 

sicist cl- edy on their pay olls.
To put it another way these
15,000 industries needed an ad~
ditional 29.9 per cent oi the

number of physicists already em-
ployed by them. Since most needs
in this tield to day are essential,
the survey's results were no
laughing matter. A new survey oi
needs is now being made,
chances are LhaL lL \Vlll not re-
veal a brighter picture.

As of Jilly, 1943, the
date for which intormation
available, there were only 995
seniors in our colleges and uni—
versities who were physics ma]-
ors. There were only 748 gradir
ate students. only 933 iuniors.
’lheir ranks are not iull cnoug'l
to meet today's \Val‘rCSSenhul
needs.

That’s the student side 01 the
picture. The iaciilty side also ic-
veals the impact or the .war, Ac-
cording to .Dr. Briseoe. of War
Manpower, there were ,553 full~
time faculty members 'in Depart-
ments or Physic; in our colleges
and universities n oi July, 19.13.

 

or this number, «so were none
physicists. although some or these
_ persons had come from related
fields, When the physics pait-
tiine teachers are counted ii,
there were 1,033 persons other
than physicists who were teach-
ing the subject in all our Depart-
ments ct Pi‘iysics.

How the physicists will meet
their manpower problem is any-i
body's guess, Students who are
beginning now to major in this‘
subject will help to fill later
needs, particularly in the post-‘
war period, But today’s physics‘
-story reads there Just aren't
enough people in the iield to go
around,
