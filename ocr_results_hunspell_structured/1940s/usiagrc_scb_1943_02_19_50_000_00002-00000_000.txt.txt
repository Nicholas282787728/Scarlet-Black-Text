Revolt and Reaction-
I

If a pendulum swinging from right to left
indicates a revolution from one extreme to
another, then a pendulum in the quadrangle
this week has vol-king overtime! Students
scream i'or student government, especiallv
in waitimc, and then either become letli;

gic in the' response to disagreeable leg‘isr
lation or react with exhibitions such as was
witnessed by many last Monday night.

The “ext 'a-legal”, as the League Board
termed it, display of student opinion on that
occasion was, perhaps, a bit out of line. But
the purpose was accomplished, Whether it
would have been possible under any other
conditions is debatable.

This particular incident is only one of a
number but it proves the point. The appeal
for the abandonment of this year’s dance
intramural began as a logical, peaceful move—
ment. If the plan had been carried through
from the beginning in that same vein, all
might have gone well. Instead, it was placed
in the hands of a few individuals who saw
fit to disregard it absolutely until strong
action convinced them that adverse opinion
existed. Then when opposing factions re»
sorted to mob technics and petitions, it was
too late to arouse anything but anger and
hurt feelings.

By this recent exhibition, it has been pro-
ed that student government can rise to the
occasion alid get what it wants by any ugly
methods it desires. But why must we neces-
sarily become hysterical to realize the fruits
of our efforts? Unless we make an awkward
issue of a situation, and conduct a minor
revolution, is it thought that student feel-
ing on the matter is only a mild opinion?

Perhaps the solution to the whole thing
lies in listening to that first murmur of stil-

dent opinion rather than to the personal
opinion of a few.
II

There is another view to be taken of our
explosion of this past week. More than being
violation and reviolation of soecalled dome
ocratic principles, it is evidence and reminder
that there are only twenty-four hours in a
day. With the general wartime speed-up of
all our activities, the long-range view of it
is that the dance intramural question came
very near to being the proverbial straw that
broke the camel’s bac . Our susceptibility
to disease and emotional confusion of the
moment are likewise proof that our total
nervous system can only . ithstand so much
added strain and that the planning and
coordination of our mass activities should
be more carefully supervised in these days
to prevent traffic jams not only in the calenr
dar of events but especially in our individual
lives.

What with an accelerated course program,
\\ r minors, conditioning, and the like to be
attended to, we have much need of shock
absorbers in our lives. Those who have we.
pared for a dance intramural in the past
know that neither that preparation nor any
discussion of same possess any elements of
the Shock absorber. 0n the contrary they
cause weeks and days of strain; we would
be wise in the future to plan to have a less
arduous and more spontaneous substitute
of the event without losing its particular
flavor.

We repeat, THERE ARE ONLY

TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IN A DAY.

They Mean Business---

The period 01' wonderment is over. No longer
do men in the reserves who received low
grades have to worry how long they will be
allowed to stay in school. This week the
E.R.C; reserves who did not maintain gran
duation standards were told to report for
active duty within a week. In an editorial
in the SCARLET and BLACK on Nov. '4
men were urgently requested to keep their
grades up to pariwarhystcria or no. Last
week’s action was predicted. How long the
Navy will allow its men in similar straits
to remain is a question, but the army calling
should sewe as a warning for the future.
You miist produce here or in you go. You
must realize that it is a privilege to stay in
college these days. You must keep your
grades and our conditioning requirements
up to standard at all times. The armed
forces are not going to toy with men who
cannot meet their responsibilities. Gentle-
men, the war and navy departments mean
business- The alternatives are clear. You

To the Editor:

The men of Dibble have commit»
ted an unfavorable crime. When
we moved out of Macy house We
left bchmd us “everything from
shoes and filthy sex to canceled
bus tickets."

’ “Every light bulb was re
moved, . .. v but if we had not
taken them we would have stu-
dlcd with candles or by the light
of the ﬁreplace, as did Abraham
Lincoln.

“The walls of the stairway.
ucwly painted last September are
Ilng-ermarkcd and dirty . . .
Piulnly the house officers were
grossly negligent of their obliga-
tions." We reuhzc there was no
reason [or this, because there
were only twentyfive rcllows go-
ing up and down those steps ex»
cry day. The house officers cclu
talnly should have stood at the
top and bottom washing each
man's hands before he even en-
tered the region of the stairway.

Mecy house as wc understand
it, is to be converted from a
men’s house to a private hcme, u
change which will be expensive.
Of that there is no doubt. Could
the college be taking this oppor-
tunity to make the leblc men
pay for it by asking for a deposit
of ten dollars room depcslt which
each of us made at the beginning
of last semester?

We ﬁnd $240.00 2. lac of money
and we wonder, if it is possible
that in raking us over the coals
the executive omces have huge:-
ten the many mornings that Dib-
ble men took clinkers from the
Inrnocki‘ebuilt ulc rn-e, cvcu had
to have grate fir-es in the club
room and the house mother’s
suite, all to get the mmperatme
allowed by the w. P. B, of 65
degrees. And have they forgot-
tell the times we slmvcled the
walks of snow and ice?

Let us propose then to submit

a bill to the treasurer for this
work. It may, who knows, offset
the cash settlement now due.
sincerely as one puzent put it,
the whole thing is a gross exag-
geratian.
