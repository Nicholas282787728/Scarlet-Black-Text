Pre- War Europe

In Initial Lecture
By Thorn Kohl, ‘

Giving a brief resume of the his-
tory of the 10th century, Dr. Hans
Kohn, professor at Smith college.
opened the fourth annual history
lectures here last night.

Dr. Kohn, speaking on “Nation
alism and Imperialism of the
19th Century," said that the first
half or the 19th century was the
age of idealism, nationalism, and
general optimism.

“The second half of the con
tury," he stated, "was the age of
materialism, imperialism. and
pessimism.” Dr. Kohn put the di-
viding line of the century at 1518.

The real beginning of the 19th
century, the smith college profes-
sor stated, was in 1815 at the
congress of Vienna. which ended
the Napoleonic wars. At this
time, the people of Europe were
happy, not about the future, but
about the “good old days."

Following 1843, the smith col-
lege professor said, all the coun—
tries of Europe embarked on huge
expansion projects.

“warlike actions outside of
Europe by the continental counv
tries kept me first World War
from beginning any sooner than
it did," Dr. Kohn brought out.

He listed as two reasons for
the World War, the expansion of
Germany and international an-
archy or the conflicting inter-e
csts of the European countries.

In the second of his eight
scheduled lectures, Dr. Kohn will
discuss “The First World War
and Its Outcome," at 7:30 p. m.
tonight in Herrick chapel.

pus publications in general.
