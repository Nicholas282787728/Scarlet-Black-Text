{IN HAMPTON

“Hampton gets finer and finer,"
writes Phyllis Hook from vir-
ginia’s Hampton institute, “and

the tellas and gals are really
Swell."

thll, a Hampton student of a
little over a month ,writes her
Haines basement pals, “Dances

go, and have a wonderful time."

party-pooper (believe it or not)
is a “schlerml'.

Everyone was excited, and snow-
ball fights held forth until
melted. She's “Simply Iascinateu
