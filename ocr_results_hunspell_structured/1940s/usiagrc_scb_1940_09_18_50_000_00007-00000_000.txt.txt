Hear Ye! Hear Ye.’ Professor Claims
Good Grades from Horizontal Study

NEW' YORK CITY7(,ACP)7
Study in bed and . get good
gradesl

That's the conclusion of coluine
bia‘ univel‘stty’s instructor in
Irish culture, Collins Healy, after
a long and detailed study of Irish
methods of study. which revealed
that the students of the Emerald
Isle did their studying while in
a horizontal posture.

“The vision of schools equipped
with reclining and sleeping ace
commodations may seem fantass
tie and far removed from what
we currently consider good edu-
cational practice. but psychologi-
cal investigations accredit the
horizontal posture during study
as sound,” Heaiy says.

According to Edmund campion,
who wrote his history of Ireland

in 1571. Healy continues, it was
a common sight to see students
“groveling upon couches of straw,
their books to their noses, them-
selves lying riatte prostrate, ans
so to chnunte out their lessons
by peccc-nieale, being the most
part lustie followes of twenty-
five yeares and upward."

Grinnell students will doubtless-
ly be glad to hear of this find-
ing in order to strengthen the
argument for sleepmg through
eight o’clock classes. Although
Heaiy said investigations indi—
cated a large number of writers,
men of science, ministers and
statesmen preferred horizontal
posture, they used it to do their
inteuectual woi-lt.

Dibble Wins Gardner Trophy
. VLOLLN TEACHER O

Rawson Takes First
In Scholarship To
Land Second Place

Rawson hall won the intramural
scholarship trophy, but the points
obtained were not quite enough
to over-come the huge lead Dibb'
had built up through its five
victories in intramural tollrna~
ments last year.

Scholarship was the only first
place the Kelly men received all
year, however, they kept in the
race by coming in second six
times.

Smith hall, diree times winner
of the intramural race and hold
ers of the Thompson trophy, were
third. Langan was fourth; Clark,
fifth; and Gates, sixth.

By virtue of winning the in-
tramural race, Dibble hall gains
one leg on the Gardner trophy,
which was donated this year by
Machin Gardner, admissions
counsellor.

A $150,000 gift has enabled Mer-
cer university, Macon, Ga, to
complete its five-year building
program.
