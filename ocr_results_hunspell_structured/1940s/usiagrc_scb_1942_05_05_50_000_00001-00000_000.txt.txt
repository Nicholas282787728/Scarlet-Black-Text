April 12, after an eventful trip
through mine.infestcd waters, Ho

chant ship.

He informed listciiers that con
voys of ships were hit by lap»
ancsc torpedoes the day before
and the day after his boat- left,
but his boat escaped injury.

Desc ibing living conditions on
the island of Sumatra, he said
that natives recciue an avcragc

They are satisfied with that
amount since their standard of
living is low. Figland pointed out.

Maylayan natives gave up fight—
ing so easily is that they knew
they were to be dominated by
some government and were un-
concerned as to which it should
be.

had lived on the islands lcd Jape
