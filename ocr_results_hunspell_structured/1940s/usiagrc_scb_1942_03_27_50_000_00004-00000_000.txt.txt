and athletic director of the unit,
has written Duke asking about
the possibility of scheduling a
football game and possible basket-
ball contests next yeer.

Duke Said that no action had
been taken yet by the college,
but that it was highly probable
that such games would be sched-

Facully Rides—

Bicycles {or Business

Fourteen faculty members are
succumbing to the forces of war
hnd to the balmy breezes of
spring. perhaps even substituting
for conditioning, by returning to
childhood and bicycles for them~
selves and their wives.

Among the more prominent of
the faculty families indulging in
this sport rs the Grant 0. Gale
family which has three bicycles.
One is for Gale to ride back and
forth to Work; one is for his wife;
and the other for his seven year
old child. On Sunday and other
free days the whole family goes
forth with Gale's daughter pel‘chr
ed on a rumble seat of his br-
cycle and the cat and dog in a
basket of another.

On: or the business men of the
campus who has also taken up
the sport is Louis v. Phelps, col-
lege treasurer, who has purchas-
ed a bright green' bicycle. It is
only two weeks old, and has
drawn many comments from fac-
ulty and students as Phelps is
seen pumping to and from work.

A 25 year old bicycle owned
by Dr, Henry s, Cunard is still
in storage but he said, “I gen-
erally /get it out in the spring."
He bought it second hand from a
student who left Grinnell to join
the armed forces of the first
World war.

,An English bicycle with three
gears, and double hand brakes
took its place on the campus
when John Scott Everton came to
Grinnell, and now another has
been added to his family. His wife
purchased a bicycle about a
month ago, and both of them ride
on Sundays Dr. Everton uses his
for any campus trips he has.
