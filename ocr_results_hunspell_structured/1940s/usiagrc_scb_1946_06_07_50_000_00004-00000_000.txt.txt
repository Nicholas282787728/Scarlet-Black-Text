TELLS S&B I

ABOUT NAZI OCCUPATIONl

By Alice Powers

”The youth of Norway has become more realistic, We

are interested only in what we do, not what we Say,

said I

Roll AI‘VidSOn, exchange student from a suburb of Oslo, who
came to Gl-innell several weeks ago to study pre—lnedicinc.

Arvidson, who spent the years-
of the German occupation in
Sweden and Norway, studied at
the Univer ty of Oslo and re~
ceived military training with a
group of Norwegian youth who
fled to Sweden. about fourteeiil,
thousand of them were, trained in'
various parts of Sweden to helpL
in the anticipated invasion by the
Allies of the peninsula. At the
same time, the Norwegian army
and fleet were in England, and
more were being trained in Torr
onto. When the Allied victory
was accomplished without invas-
ion in that area, they returned
to Norway to guard camps for
interned Nazis and to help in
rounding them up.

azi Occupation

During the German occupation.
the Germans arrested many Noi-
wegian citizens. Although actual-
ly only about two percent of the
population were Nazis. one of
the greatest difficulties of the
Norwegians who worked in any
way for the underground was not
being able to trust anyone.

“We learned what we really
can get done with cooperation"
Arvidson said. “We learned that
it is possible for people of d
fei-eiit classes to work together,
reducing the distinction between
the classes. It is my Oplnion that
the intellectual class did a great
deal in the resistance against the
Germans.”

"Many of us learned to look
at life in another way. We
had to laugh to iii-a through
the days. \Ve learned to dis-
tinguish between the impor-
tant things and the little
things. We learned that lux-
urious clothes and food are
not so important after all."

The German soldiers almost all
loved and admired Hitler, and
were generally narrow minded,
The Norwegians had a great deal
of fun during the occupation,
laughing at the stupidity of the
German soldiers, In one office
where Arvidson was working, two
men from a different department
of that office had been arrested.
They had told the Nazis that
eleven persons were employed in
the office. When the Gestapo
came to arrest all of the employ»
ees, there were thirteen there.
Since their orders said that there
would be only eleven, the soldiers
arrested eleven, leaving Arvidson
and another employee.

Streetcar Etiquette

On the street care in :Oslo, the
Norwegians usually remained
standing‘ rather than sit next to
a Nazi. This went on for some
time, even in very crowded cars,
making their contempt for the
Nazis very obvious. Soon an of-
ficial order appeared, stating that
there should be no va'cant seats
if people were standing.

The Nazi soldiers were sen-

. sitive to the color red, since
they felt that it signified
Russia, and often stopped :peo-
ple they thought were wear-
ing too much red clothing
and conﬁscated some of it.

In describing his education, Ar-
vidson explained the differences
between the Norwegian school
system and ours. Their grade

school has only seven grades, and
high school three, but students
who wish to go on to a univer-
sity must first receive a degree
from a different sort of school
known as the “gymnasium". They
choose one of three major fields;
Latin. English and history, or
mathematics and physics. There
is a set course of study for each
of these, and in all of them,
Norwegian and histoiy are re-
quired. The entire grade is based
on final oral and written exam—
inations which are taken at the
end of three years, and may be
taken even though the student
has not attended classes. Each
group meets in the same room
and has the same classes, at least
for the main subject, for the en-
tire three years.

The University of Oslo, which
has facilities for 1,000 students,
now has an enrollment of about
6,000. The medical course, which
usually takes seven years, and is
given in sections, now requires a
longer time for most students be-
cause they must wait for a place
in the overcrowded sections.
Courses in pbychology, philosophy,
and logic are required for all
students.

Arvidson expects to study med-
icine and psychiatry, and train
for psychoanalysis in this country.

S&B PASSES 5
ON COLLEGE

By Mary Ann Hursh

June 7. I946

l MARK
CENTENNIAL

“To represent the growing interests of the college along

many lines" was the task cut

out for the Scarlet and Black

in its first issue. September 12, 1894, marked the initial ap-

pearance of Grinnell’s present
d_zly it completes its fifty— 114st

weekly news publication, To-
year.

The S. & 13. entered the publication setup at Glzinnell

‘in competition with the Unit, fl newsrlitel‘ary weekly, by

presenting a newspaper of news and advertisements, two
times a Week, With policies directed by the Scarlet and Black
Association, the editorial board of the new publication was

headed by W. A, Willard, '95,
business manager.

In September of 1896, the s. m,
is. merged with the Unit under
a joint board The nameplate
across the top of page one now
read: “The Scarlet and-Black»
However in Octoberl
of that year the present 5. w B.
began, for it severed itself from
the Unit, which became a monthly
literary magazine.

The news and editorial policyl
of the s. it B. in its early years
could haadly he called “yellow”.
It took a strong stand for school_
spir‘ , printing extra supplements
of results of all major athletic
events, The first of these came
out October 6, 1594. with the
banner headline, “Grinnell Brain
Overcomcs Simpson Brawn”.

Cartoons

Cartoons found their way to the
front page for the first time on
Feb. 2, 1395, when one appeared
depicting the cutthroat Competi—
tion between the new S. dc B. and
the Unit for campus-news.

The first real headline in a
regular issue was a- big event,
Previously they had been mere
titles such as “The Purpose of the
Board of Athletic Control”. The
Sept. 25, 1901, issue carried the
unmistakable lleadllnei

“Val-sity Wins

Defeats Alumni

By a Score of 16 to 0"

This was the first step toward
modernizing the paper. Next came
the twoccolumn head in November
of 1901 proclaiming an invasion
by the Simpson grid team which
was coming “prepared to win".
