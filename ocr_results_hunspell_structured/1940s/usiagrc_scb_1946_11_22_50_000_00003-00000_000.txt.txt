Navy Announces
Educaﬁonal Plan

,Aimed to benefit those men ab
tending college without benefits
of the GI, bill, the Navy has made
public two new plans under which
men of draft age may fulfill their
military training requirements,
and at the same time receive free

a full college education at the
school of their choice. ‘

One program is the v-5 flight
training program, under which the
student chooses his own college
and attends in civ an clothes
with all expenses paid for from
one to four semesters. Then he
receives 15 months of flight train—
ing, nine months of Midshipman
flight duty with the Fleet, follow-
ed by a year of duty as a flight
Ensign. On completion of this
duty, he will get his choice of
remaining in the Navy or of re-
turning to civilian life and com-
pleting his college education, still
at no cost to him. ,

The other program reopens the
peacetime NRO'DC, which includes
a full four—year college course at
Navy expense, and concludes with
the commissioning of the candi-
date in the U. 5. Navy or Marine
Corps.

Candidates for either of the
two programs must submit their
applications by Dec. 17. Further
information is available at Dean
Karl Dearborn's office.

Cleveland Gives Dinner

Cleveland women entertained at
a date dinner last Sunday noun in
the quadrangle dining room.

Dancing and bridge in the rec
room served as entertainment a!»
ter dinner, and refreshments were
served.

 

“The story of Childe Roland
shows raw human courage un-
equalled in the annals of litera-
tur,e" stated James "Tex” Kauf-
mann, town senior, yesterday in
his chapel speech “Childe Roland
to the Dark Tower Came”.

Ks‘ufmann applied the story of
Roland to the problems of grow-
ing from childhood to manhood,
mainly of losing beliefs in things
that are not true, being ashamed
of things we care about, and be-
ing alarmed at what actually is.

“We have to realize and face
our problems. sWe are here in
this world and we are here
alone", “Tex.” said.

He went on to say "Ideals are
standards of beauty, excellence of
perfection. We must apply them,
not avoid them, We alone must
sustain them; we must stand for
them".

“Everyone is in the same plight,
each is looking for a way to
solve his problems. When we real-
ize this we can have sympathy for
others and self respect for our—
selve , .

Elaine Kayser, James senior,
and John Spencer, Clark senior,»
