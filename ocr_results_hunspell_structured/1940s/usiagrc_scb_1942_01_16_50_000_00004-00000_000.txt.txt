By Thorn Kuhl

Coach Bell Douglas and it
ninevmftn squad left Gi‘innell
this afternoon on the Rock
Island fo‘ Riiioil, Wis, where
they will battle the Ripon
Redmeli Saturday night.

Coach Douglas expects a tough
game, and in speaking of the
Ripoxi star, Ted Scalissi, who
scored 22 points Saturday, and 19
Monday night against Beioit, he
said, “Anyone who can score 19
points against the Beloit defense
is a good player." ,
Use FasteBreaking offensive.

The Ripon Redrnen use a fast
breaking offense whereby the
guards do most of the scoring,
which can account for most of
SCzlissi’s points. Douglas expects
to give the task of guarding the
Ripon star to either Patterson or
Youngstrom.

The Wisconsin five at the pres-
exit is in fourth place in the Cons
ference, biit is improving with

Heads Second

Semes’fer Gadabou’r Calendar

A ”President's Birthday Ball,"
held simultaneously with similar
celebrations throughout the coun-
try, will be the form of the
semester dztllcc. Jan. 30, James
Miles, Gadabout club director,
said last night, as he announced
the program of the organization
for the sccond semester.

Election of a “hasketballsweet-
heart," presentation of a winter
carnival, and a second roller
skating party are highlights of
the second semester- schedule,

The “basketball sweetheart."
will be named at a Valentine
dance following the Ripon game
here, Feb, 14. The winter Car i-
vnl, set for Saturday, Feb. 21,
will be one of the largest events
of the year, according to Miles.
Both campus and town facilities
are being used. Skating, skiing,
and hob-sledding are scheduled.
The country club has been re-
served, with dancing and refresh
meiits there.

Prompted by the success of the
first roller skating party here last
semester, Miles said the club dis
rectors had contacted for another,
Saturday, March it.

“The World of Tomorrow,"
which Miles says, “will probably
be one of depression,” will be the

theme of a women's invitation
dance Feb. 28. “We want every-
one to wear their oldest clothes
to this one,” he said. “A lot of
surprises have been pranned."

Another “surprise" affair is the
March 7 date. Listed on the Gada-
boiit program only as "7'7??",
the affair will be built around a
secret theme to be announced a
half hour before the cvcnt.

Dictators will come in for what
Gddabout directors call “their
just deserts" at the ”Dictators
Dig" on March 28. “Old clothes
might be a good idea for this
one, too,” Miles said, “because
eggs will be ﬂying."

A masquerade is scheduled for
the wDinen's invitation dance on
April 11, with the "Count 11"
orchestra. An amateur show, which
will be a full evening's program,
is set for Friday, April 24.

Another successful first semes-
ter cvent will be repeated May 1
with the May Day hay-ride. Last
informal event of the season will
be a picnic at Arbor lake, Satur—
day afternoon, May 23.

Climax of the schedule is the
senior prom, May 23. which will
be financed by the Gadabout or—
ganization, with decorations and
arrangements by the senior class.

there immediately, and will prob
ably be planned along the lines
that have proved successfiu in

AFTERMATH: In a news release
about the Beloit game, the writer
became very confused and stated
"G‘iniiell tipped Beloit in the
wildest‘ game of the season with
26 points being scored in the over-
time. . . It would certainly take
quite a deal of shooting to score
that many points in an overtime
period. . Twenty—one shots, includ-
ing free throws, were taken in
the extra session.
