Suspended Judgmen‘lL - —

The unfortunate accompaniment of war,
the atrocity story, is with us again. This
time it has broken out as part of the cam-
paign against the Japanese in the South
Pacifi. Before we pass judgment before
we take solemn vows to forever ex inguish
the Japanese race from the surface of
the earth, let' us stop and take stock of
the situation and see what sort of attitude
and what sort of action is called fort

It is only too true that the stories, as
reported to us, are supported by tlle sworn
testimony of officers in the United States
Army. It is also true that Congress and
the President and the Foreign Secretary
of the British Government have come out
with statements that tend to support the
truth of the stories. Against that mass
of evidence we have only the bitter ex
perience of the atrocity stories of the last
war- Those stories were documented care—
fully and backed up by photographs, After
the heat of the war had subsided, after the
various governments had published their
own accounts of the atrocities, we found
to our dismay that many of the stories
and many of the photographs existed only
as figments of the fertile imagination of
George Creel, our director of public in-
formation in the last war.

We also have the other uncomfortable
fact that the sale of War Bonds in the
city of New York jumped from four mil-
lion dollars on the day before the atrocity
stories were released toieight million dol-
lars on the day after the stories came out.
We all realize that the buying of war
bonds is our way of fighting this war.
But do they have to be bought at the cost
of hate? !

The controvei y over whether or not
the stories are true is entirely pointless
except in so far as it creates an attitude
of suspended judgment. How we take these
stories and the course of action our atti—
tude indicates is a horse of a very different
color:

It may be quite necessary that the men
on the fighting front hate the enemy in
order to fight well.

We of the student body realize that1
there is a war ill progress and are morci
than willing to make any number of sacs
rifices, when they are occasioned by, and,
further the war effort, However, after
lnucll serious thought and deliberation, we
have come to the conclusion that the
breakfasts (for so they are called, though‘
in our opinion it is a misnomer) we en-,
dure are accomplishing nothing, but a cres‘
ation of disgusting and repulsive thoughts ,

It’s our sincere belief that the admin!
istration doesn’t realize the true status of

‘ affairs and we honestly hope that serious:

efforts will be made to rectify the situa i
tion. To get on with our concrete com-
plaints, holl'evcr, we would like to have
the administration imagine themselves in
our positions of eating extremely hard and
cold toast, unbu’ttered; of eating raw eggs,
when there are eggs, and we assure our
readers that these times are few and far
between (eggs are cheaper now, too); of
eating grapefruit and orange halves, or at-
tempting to eatiit‘s more of a system of
gouging and praying—that haven‘t had the
segments separated; of the monotony of l
the whole thing, morning after morning;
and to top all this off, the whole process
necessitates arising forty-five minutes
early in the darkness, which in itself is very
discouraging. This works an especial hard-
ship on the boys who not only have to
walk quite a distance over, but have to
retrace the distance to get their books
What makes the whole situation doubly
discouraging is the fact that a much larger
and better prepared breakfast may be.pu1>_

We are quite willing to acknowledge that
