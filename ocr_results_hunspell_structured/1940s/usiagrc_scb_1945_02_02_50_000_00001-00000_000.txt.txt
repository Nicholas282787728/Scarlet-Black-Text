Grinnell Host To
Original Disney
Cartoons’ Show

Forty original paintings from
the Walt Disney studio in Holly-
wood will be on display in Main
hall for three weeks. The ex-
hibit is to begin the early part
of next week.

The paintings are done on eel-
luloid and have been used in the
production of the Disney movies.
They were not actually done by
Disney, but by members of his
staff animation artists and
color specialists, From the
thousands of paintings made for
his films, these forty have been
selected for exhibition.

‘Unlike all other types of paint-
ings and drawings, Disney's are
seen from the opposite side of
the painted surface. Outlines are
traced on the right side in van-
colored inks, but the actual fi -
ing in of color is done on the
under side. This type of work is
very difficult because each plate
must be exactly like the prevlr
ous one, except for a tiny bit of
movement. So that when they
are photographed in succession

and run off rapidly on a projec-l

tor, the effect

The animated cartoon whlch‘
Disney pioneered is considered‘
today to be America's greatest
contribution to art. it is com-
pletely modern and uprmrdate,
yet preserves the fineness of line
and color of the older art forms.
Music, on and drama are come
bined into one single medium of
expression, to form a piece of
art which amuses and educates
'simultaneously and appeals to
all types of people.

 

 

Personnel Boar

The sophomore qualifying exam»
inations, which were presented
during the week of semester ex-
aminations, are in process of be-
‘,ing graded by the faculty memr
‘bers and the personnel board.

lAppi-oximately one-third of the
sophomore class took each one
of the three tests. Both the Dean
of the faculty and the director
of personnci were very much
gratified by the response of the
students.

ther work in that field. at elev»
en students who took the French
test, eight were considered qualir
fied. 0f the sixteen students
taking the examination in Span»
ish, eleven received high enough
scores to show that they had
met the requirement in that lan-
guage.

It should be understood that
qualifying is not the sole factor
in deciding whether or not a stu-
dent hss met the requirements of
a certain area of study. It is
a major factor, but prcvious ex-
perience and class work are also
considered.

one purpose of qualifying ex»
aminations is to liberalize'the
curriculum so that a student who
has adequate knowledge in the
required fields can eliminate
those subjects and go ahead to
take optional courses, These ex»

It is not essential to qualify by
