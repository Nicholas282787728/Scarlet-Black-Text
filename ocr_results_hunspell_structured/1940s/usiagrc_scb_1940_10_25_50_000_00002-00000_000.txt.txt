GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1940‘

 

Martha F. Crowe, ‘Lady Principal,’
Brought Co-Education Here in 1861

To the 355 coeds at Grinncll this
year the name of Martha Footc
Crowe should be as familiar as
the latest Bing Crosby tune

For Martha Foote ci-owe, Lady
F!‘m€|pal' at Iowa college in
1337, was a champion of female
education and the protector of
female virtue at a time when
women were considered as un~
necessary to a college as a chap-
erone at a student picnic.

In an address at the inaugura-
tion of President Gates in 1887,
Martha ci-owe related the story
of coreducahon at Iowa college.
As she told it, nine girl graduates
ot Davenport high school asked
to be allowed to recite in the
freshman class of the college.
They were allowed to do this un-
der the condition that they should
have nothing else to do with the
college and should not attend
prayers.

“For in coming to and from
prayer l' Martha crowe said,
“the boys acted in an ungentle-
manly manner, whistling and oth-
erwise trying to attract atten—
tion."

“When Iowa college was moved
to Gl'innell,” she continued, "it
was proposed and passed that all
classes he open to women."

This same 'tLady Principal”
later pointed out the work that
the women graduates had done.
“From this course 108 young
women have graduated. Three of
them have gone into foreign mis<
sionary work, where two stiu
are, and where the third would
still have been, out that her no-

ble service in Oomzooinby (where
cver that might be) has worn
out her physical strength. Four
.,ai»e working among the freedr
mienv-negl'oes, five among the
Mormans and one is doing noble
work among the Indians."

Dr. Gates in the first part of
his inaugural address took up the
same subject and praised “the
Christian work of such noble
women." Moreover, he believed in
women's riglltsi" . . . tit least
to the extent of her having all
she can get.”

tor of Humane Letters.

ory Life."
Analytical Trend stressed,

Gidoeiise pointed out that edur
cation requires a redefinition of
its aims, “Education," he stateed,
“has splintered off into intense
specialization; and -this analytical,
objective tendency, which scrutinr
izes minutely only a special cor-
ner of a subject has resulted in
inability to r assemble the
whole."

He indicated that the values
which enable a student to judge
knowledge and apply it into a
unit have lain, in the past, within
the church and the home, and
emphasized the fact that the
church and the home as moral
influences have to a great ex-
tent lost their inﬂuence. He
stressed the necessity {Dr teach-
ing moral discipline, correlation
of knowledge and better living
as the task confronting liberal
colleges.
