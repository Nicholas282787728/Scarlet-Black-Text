With Timing,

Women Opposed
To Drinking Rules

WSGA Poll Shows
Girls Desire Change

In an effort to know the at-i
titiide, oi the Grinnell women inl
regard to the drinking rule and
its enforcement the League
Board poled south campus stir
dents Sunday, Nov. 23. “It was
not done in order to rcvoliition-
ize the drinking problem at Gl'il-l-
hell," explained League Board
President Mary MecMuri-ay, “It'
is an endeavor to uiiderstandnot
only the administration's ViewA
point, but also the student's."

South campus students are
evidently opposed, 259-119, to
the present restrictions against
drinking. The most decisive
vote on this question was east
by tho upperolass women under
21 years, who voted 144-74
against the rule.

The results of the poll were
tabulated, on the basis of age
groups; freshman, iippcrclassmen
under 21 ,and upperclassmen over
21.

A majority of voters were of
the opinion that the solution to
the drinking problem lies-iii perv
mitting the Woman to drink “as
long as she conducts herselt in a
socially acceptable manneri” Ov-
erwhelmingly weak was the vote
cast for permitting the student
to drink “as she pleases without
,restriction." Neitbcr freshmen nor
upperclassmen over 21, voted for
this solution, while upperclassmcn,
under 21 cost eight votes in itsl
favor. l

The role on which the women
were being polled is as tollows:
“The use or possession of liquor
either on or off campus is proA
hibited by the college. Students
in residence are forbidden to take
any intoxicating drink in (3'
hell. The administrative comm'
tee and the League Board share
responsibility for enforcement of
this rule. Penalties for breaking
the rule are as follows:
