it. In a blanket (caught your

said that Gi-inncll has succumbed
to a dog invasion.

Doggiest people on campus are
the Reverend and Mrs Bl'lclalld.

Largest concentration of Ca»
nine cuties is in the barracks
neighborhood. The “Hound Book"
lists blond cocker Crisco, head of
the Orr and Terry Bul'ns' house-
hold. as a newcomer Next door
to Crisco lives German shepherd
chipper Rnllije, the people's
friend and the squlrl‘eis‘ mortal
enemy.

iOne ot Chippcl“s buddies is an

and Irish setter Tucker, who
(when not‘ with Sinbad) adorns

Underneath the veneer of berhopl
and ballad, and behind the still
from of the dixicland and (lance-i
able, we have hidden under

by no means a bush leagucr. His
“Plano Goiiceito” and
Love" have hit the Hll. Parade:

a patriotic theme during the big
fracas, they dug up Beethoven's
“Fifth Symphony”. and the gent
on the pavement went around
whistling ”dotrdotrth-dash" for
victory.

And for those of us who go to
the flickers for Woody Woodel
pecker and quote “Bend over,
junior”. Walt Disney came forth‘
with M. hiouse in “The Sorcerer's
Apprentice" by Dukas.

RimskieKorsakov is as modern
and popular as George Gershwin,
and everybody goes for “Rhap—
sody in Blue.” Try something by
that Russian ex»sailor and see
what happens . . . you might be
surprised into liking it. By listen-
ing to hundreds of platters per
session, many disk jockeys main-,
tain that there is no such thing-
as a new song . the theme has,
been swiped from one of the old;
boys who isirt around to protect,

So when you're in picking up‘
Louis “Satchmo” Al-mstl‘ong’s‘
“Mahogany Hall Stomp" (one of
his best oi recent years and
reminiscent or his old Hot Five
combo), give a spin to a "square"
biscuit . . . it won’t bite or split
your personality. The classics
might be something worth lis—
tening to.
