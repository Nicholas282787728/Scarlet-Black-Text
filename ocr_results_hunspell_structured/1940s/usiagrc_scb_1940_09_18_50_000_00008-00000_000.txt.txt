You can get everything you need there. A swell
bargain in college seal stationery, 24 sheets—24
envelopes for 49 c'enls or 60 sheets—6‘0 envelopes
for 79 cents; greeting cards for every occasion;
blotter: of every shade; and waste baskets galore.
Toiletries? Every kind—Max Factor, Marcelle,
Boyer, Richard Hua'nut, and plenty of others. By
the way don’t fail lo try Cunningham hand cream
——39 cents a jar and a money back guarantee.

It’s swell for you to be at Grinnell this year
but what a task to get settled. At Cunningham’s
you can get everything to make your room
“homey” even to Cuddly toys.

By the way, we also deliver—call 204 and
we’ll deliver your candy, cigareltes, gum and just
anything else you happen to need—soaps, shav-
ing articles, and dental supplies.

Our camera department is our best selling
point—we have a compliete line of cameras—
You’ll want your developing done here as we give
a free 5x7 enlargement with every roll developed
at 25¢ per crack. We carry films, too, for all you
candid camera fiends.

During these first few days you’ll need a
fountain pen—our Sheaffer pen and ink display
is a honey—Drop in and look it over—It doesn’t
hurt to look around.

We’ll cash these "checks from home” that
everyone likes to get, even though (hey may be
Few and far between. Our package wrapping de-
parlment is wonderful—Do drop in and see us.
