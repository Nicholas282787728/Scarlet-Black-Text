Christmas, I944 - -

"And she brought forth her firstshorn son, and
wrapped him in swaddliilg clothes, and laid him
in n mongor; because there wns no room for
them in the inn."

In six days Gl'inncll campus will be
virtually deserted. The quad will be dark
and the loggia silent. Each of us will be
contemplating a Christmas different from
all the other Christmases we have known.
But still uppermost in our minds, as they
have been every year, will be thoughts of
the things we want to do, the people we
want to see, the places we want to go, the
presents we want to buy.

“And there were in the some country shep-
herds dhiaing in the iieid, keeping watch over their
ilock by night." ,

For Yanks in the streets of Aachen, and
Bleeck the last Monday in December will
be ostensibly just like every other Monday.
Their feet will he just as cold and their
clothes just as dirtyl Any Christmas spirit
will have to come from within, unaided by
conducive surroundings But certainly there
will be aigroup of American doughboys
singing “0 Little Town of Bethlehem” in
the village where, according to the papers,
”American troops found more Nazi dead
piled ill the streets than in any German
town yet entered.” Could we do as well?

“And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon
them, and the glory of the Lord shone rouul
about them and they were sore aimiil."

And some of our friends will be on
islands where Christmas has never been

complete or even in semi-complete harmony. ”3“

“For unto you is born this day in the city of
David a Suviuur, which is Christ the Lord."

We are convinced that war is eternal
and inevitable. We must spend this vacation
without Bob and Roger, and it seems quite
likely that they will not be home by next
Christmas. Such a situation bids fair to
produce a great new generation of cynics.
College people, on the whole, are prollc to‘

that many of us have not reached adult—
hood. The present era, however, gives us a
chance to show whether or not we are caps
able of adult behavior, Our parents and
teachers sec in us a nucleus of the world’s
future leaders. At the present they may
wonder whether this is encouraging or dis
couraging. ‘

“And this shall he a sign unto you; Ye shnll

Of course, we realize the futility of blind
optimism. No educated young person can
see the world through those well-known
rosercolorcd glasses. But what we are apt
to forget is that we may lean too far in
the opposite direction. Nothing will ever
he gained by stoic acceptance of life or by
confirmed pessimism. The world has enough
adherents to these faiths. It is up to the
young people of America to remain idcal-
ists. We miist maintain our belief in a
bright future. We milst try to convince
the world that an intelligent, realistic ideal-
isin is tile way to happiness. People may
laugh at idealism and call it “young" and
”impractical.” But in an age where idealism
is dead, there is little need for laughter.
This Christmas season, our third while at
war, offers us an excellent opportunity to
prove our poillt. If idealism is to be kept
alive, we are the ones to do it.

“And suddenly there was with the angel a
multitude oi the heavenly host praising God, and
saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
pence, good will toward men."
