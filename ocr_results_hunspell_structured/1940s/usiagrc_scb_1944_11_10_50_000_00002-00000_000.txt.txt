Clesi la Guerre - -

We of Grinnell have sunk to a new low
in prestige when our friends and teachers
begin to feel that we must be compelled
to contribute to the war effort. But when
they force us to pretend to contribute, their
motives are the ones to be questioned, not
ours Consequently, we should like to ques-
tion: Why are we railroaded'into taking
war activities, and what do tlley contribute
which can not be as well or better effected
elsewhere?

It is a popular misconception on campus
that credit for a war activity is required
for graduation. The faculty has not yet
added this to our regular curriculum. It
merely “expects” each student to partici-
pate. More accurately, it expects each fe-
male student to participate Apparently,
the benefits of such a system are to be
given and received only by girls. Grinnell’s
Pine Tree association is excluded. If this
work were really worthwhile, isn’t it rea
sonable to assume that not only both women
and men students, but all the faculty as
well would be improved?

“Now, today, Girls, we shall go down to
the meat market and see how the butcher
cuts up the meat!” Slightly exaggerated,
perhaps, but such is the general tone of tlle
euthenics classes. Post—war seminar is fine
from a discussion and thought—developing
standpoint, to be sure, But, please, can’t
we be givell extra war credit for our priv
vate arguments concerning the relative mer-
its of Mr. Bauman’s ideas about Far-East-
ern history, or what Mr. Norton meant
when he said that our situation today par-
allels in many ways that of eighteenth-
century England?

Most of the war activities may be worth—
while in themselves, but have they any real
connection with that which the name war
activity implies? Even the llurses aide
course is hardly more than a group of girls,
who would be doing this in peace time,
reviewing the fundamentals of Girl Scout
first—aid, community home~nursing, and
high school physiology courses. In fact, the
only war activity which has any right to

 

the title is surgical dressings, E pluribus
lll'llll“.

We do not ask that all eleven war
courses be eliminated from campus life. We
ask only that we be treated as college peo
ple and allowed to choose for ourselves how
we can best benefit the cause. If some of
us feel that we are honestly helping, we
shall continue to do so. Surely these Grill-
nell activities do not mean to foster flip-
pancy and insincerity. No one can feel more
deeply the moral, intellectual, and social
effects of the war than does the present
student generation. We, of all people, do
not need to be convinced that ”there’s a
war on," and that we must do all we can
to will it. We could never begrudge time,
well spent toward this end. We want to}
help. They are our fathers and brothers
and sweethearts and friends. But if we are
to be offered war activities, let them be
worth the time and relevant to the war.‘
Many of us feel that those two hours per‘
week are wasted repet' ionl We should be
using the time more patriotically for study
—or for writing letters.

Dining Room Dilemma - -

Time wasiand it hasn’t been so very long
ago—when the evening meal was the most
enjoyable hour of the day The juniors
remember it vaguely, the seniors remem—
ber it very well, But the change from ill-
dividual table service to buffet servicel
seems to have revolutionized our entire
dining room conduct. We push and shove
into lille, trampling llousemothers and in,
nocent bystanders, instead of taking our
places at the foot. At the table, food is
more frequently grabbed at with accom
plished boarding house reaches than passed
to the head. What newcomer would ever
suspect that there is supposedly a head at
every table whose duties of starting the
courses and dismissing the ’table only when
all are finished have been lost in the shuf—
fle of trying to “get there first with the
most"?

Every Sunday noon we begin our meal
reverently with a hymn. Tell minutes latcl,
discordant strains of “ . . . she went a sad
tear in her bucket of beer . . i ” shatter
the ceremonious atmosphere We are dresr
sed ill our Sunday best, yet blue jeans and
flannel shirts would be more in keeplllgl
with our dining room conductl

Dining room singing has been handled'
so that it puts a satisfying and pleasing
touch on the evening meal. But who likes to
have the meal and conversation interrupted
by endless choruses of ”Here‘s to so-and-so,",
the singing of which is enjoyed only by the
few tables participating? The singing of this
little ditty started in 1942 and 1943 when
Grinnell men began to leave for the ser—
vice. It was the way we had of telling
them goodrbye from all of lls. Now there
are but few good-byes to sing. Yet sing
we must, tirelessly and endlessly, to any—
one and everyone. We startle and embarass
our guests by shouting at them. We crane
our necks and strain our eyes trying to
catch a glimpse of the center of attention
who probably won’t stand up anyway, It’s
high time we gave the poor worn-out thing
its wellvearned rest.

 

This idea of giving photographs for Christmas.
One sitting, enough photographs to take care of
all your relatives and friends . . . . and there
you are — nothing left but the wrapping and
we'll even take care of that and mail for you,
properly packaged, those which must go out of

town.

AND IT’S FAR LESS EXPENSIVE!
MAY WE PROVE IT TO YOU - TODAY?
