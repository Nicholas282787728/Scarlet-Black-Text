Emergency Morals Head—

Davis Asks Blackou’r 'For Offense

The things that Hartwell Davis
gets by with!

Only two weeks ago the stu-
dent Council surveyed the glan-
eral moral situation of Grinnell
campus. They didn’t like it. There
was the Spanish Inquisition, there
were the burn out bulbs in the
botany garden lamp posts, there
was spring around the corner.
Something had to be done before
the Ides of March, with their so-
cial implications, arrived,

-So the student Council consid-
ered. Out of its number, they
picked a paragon of virtue. Hart-
well Davis Davis was named the
Emergency Moral Committee of
one. He was given two dollars to
buy a flashlight.

Last night the student Council
had other business. They were
considering a sample poster for a
proposed campaign to save elec-
tricity in campus buildings.
“Lights Out!” the poster said,
“Save Money!" But the council
didn't. like this. The electricity was
to be saved for defense work and

And Goes Down in Disgrace

the poster should ‘say so.

“But this is more than a de-
fensive war now," said new prexy
Kaloupek, “How can we get that
idea on the poster?"

The Emergency Morals Com-
mittee of one considered. ‘iLights
Outifor Offence." shouted Hart-
well Davis Davis,
