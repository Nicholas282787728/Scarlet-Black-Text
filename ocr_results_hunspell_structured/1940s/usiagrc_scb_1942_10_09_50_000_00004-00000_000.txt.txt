football triumph in intramural
history Tuesday by smothering
Gates, 12-0, organized only last
year to compete in intramurals,
Town failed to register a football
win last year or in its first game
this year.

During the first quarter it
looked as though this losing
streak would continue. Gates
held the ball throughout the per—
iod and punched to the two yard
line before losing the hall on
downs at the close of the period.

Revived by their goal line
stand, Town fought back and
scored at the end of the first
half on a pass from A1 Frisbie to
Doug Strong. Late in the third
quarter the same combination
scored again for Town.

Morgan and Frisbi-S in the
backfield, and Frohardt and
Strong in the line played out-
standing ball for Town. Ralph
Hart completed several passes to
Eaton for Gates, while Brcmiclo
er looked wood in the lin .

line.

Clark won its first game of the
season Wednesday, pushing by

son retaliated with a safety on a
blocked pnnt in the third period.
with seven minutes remaining,
Seidlitz passed to Sparks giving
Clark six points and the ball
game.

Krause, Brody, and Seidlitz
performed well for Clark while
Howard Smith in the backfield
and Meacham in the line stood
out for Rawson.

In a hotly contested game
Thursday Dibble remained unbeate

tempting to halt a Dibble threat
in the first quarter, Frim of
Smith intercepted a Dibble pass
behind his own goal line only to
be nabbed for a safety.

It was a close rough and
tumble game until the closing
minutes when Robison of Dibble
dove over for the game’s only
touchdown, Millikan caught Sev»
eral spectacular passes thrown
by Roblson, and Jim ”Tooth”
Hammond was rugged in the line
for Dibble. Fritz played well in
the baokfleld, and Patterson
played a sturdy game in the line
for Smith.

Second S’rring

S’rarl’ Game

Grinnell hopes to move into the

win column in its game with
Knox College Saturday received
a blow this week as three veteran
backs went out of the lineup due
to injuries occurring during prac-
tice.

Ed Nagcl, pnnting and passing
standby, has a bad knee and in-
jureA‘l shoulder.

Edd Bmvers, who has been call-
ing signals and doing a lot of
blocking has pulled a leg muscle.

And Jack McGrana, an able
runner, suffered a finger injury
which is expected to keep him
from seeing much action.

This leaves Augie Gruening the
only first string back in the
starting lineup. However, Augie
has had comparatively little ex
perience this season because of
injuries early in the season.

Jim Kaufmann, who showed up
well against Drake last week
will probably replace Nagel, while
Bob Barrett, who also saw a good
deal of service in the Drake
game. is slated to take over
Bowers' position in the quarten
beck slot.

it will be the second conference
game of the season for the Pio~
neers who are trying to hreak a
7-6 losing Streak, Although rela-
tively little is known of the Knox
squad. its defeat last week lends
snbstance to the report that it
will not put a powerful team in
the field Saturday.

For Runners

Two meets have been definitely
scheduled for the Griiincil cross
country team coach John s.
Ever-ton said today.

With three weeks of training
behind them, the college team is
slated to compete against Iowa
State next Friday afternoon. The

Kodakers -- For Only 25c

second meet will take place her
tween halves of the Homecoming
game with Cornell furnishing the
oppositio ,

In addition to these meets, the
Crinnell runners should see action
in the conference meet at RIpDn
providing they make an im-
pressive showing in the first two
meets, said Everton. An attempt
is also being made to schedule a
meet with Drake University.

Coach Everton stated that he
plans to run two freshmen in the
meet Friday in addition to the
varsity team. However, their
showing will not affect the out-
come of the meet since only up—
perclassmen are eligible for come
petition.

Although Iowa state is a much
larger school, it will be the first
time in ten years that cross
country has been included in their
athletic program.

An intraesquad meet was held
Thursday afternoon to determine
the five best men for compe-
tition next week.

Lack of Players

Cramps Frosh
Football Squad

A decided shortage of fresh foote
hall candidates may prevent Grin-
nell from turning out a freshmen
football team of a brand of which
the freshman class is capable, ace
cording to Athletic Director Les-
ter G. Duke.

The freshmen team, sparked by
the brilliant backfield work of
Walt Burns and Kermit Stein-
beck, is scheduled to play a pram)"
ticc game between Newton High
School this coming week.

{Under the coaching of Louis
Gonias, last year’s grid captain,

approximately fourteen boys aie
practicing every night. From
this miniature squad coach Cone
ias is expected to develop a team
approaching the standards set by
Grinnell freshmen offormer years,
he said. -

iCoach Gonias and Duke both
expressed the opinion that among
the seventyfive boys in the
freshman class should be found
enough football talent to build
a first class fresh team.,This ob-
vious lack of spirit on the part
of the freshmen inen seems quite
without justification, and any boys
capable of running or carrying a
ball are urged to report for pracs
tice immediately, Duke said.

Members of the intramural
board also decided to re»chalk
the football field in such a way
that there will be end-zones. This
step will mean having a field
smaller than regulation size, but
held space will not permit a {tulle
