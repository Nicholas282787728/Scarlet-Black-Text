and snow conditions lor the skiing events were poor, but the weekend was a huge success
just the same. Even though they had to sit through a driving rainstorm, 2000 people sat on a
snow-covered hillside for an hour to watch the cclprlul spectacle of Outdoor Evening.
J. Pluvius lound that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't daunt the Tun—loving students
