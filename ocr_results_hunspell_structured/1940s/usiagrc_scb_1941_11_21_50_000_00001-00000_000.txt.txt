Razing of Transit House Recalls
Historical ‘Grinnell Time’ Days

Do you know why your watch
runs down and why you wind it
up? And do you go around blith
ely quoting ”the zero hour is
here,” and not know what the
zero hour is?

You'd better go over to Good-
now hall and see Grant 0. Gate.
associate professor of physics.

with the help of two $2,000
clocks, he can explain all these
things to you. The scientific
clocks, built for the Centenial Ex-
position at Philadelphia in 1876,
were presented to the college by
Mrs. c. S. Hobart in 1858.

With them, Grinnell college
furnished standard time for the
middle west until cstahlishment
of naval observatory time by the
government, Rock Island trains ran
by the college standard and all
stations of the line were tele-
graphed the correct time.

Scientifically speaking,
clocks are ‘Sidcrial’ and mean
‘solar' mechanisms ”This only
means one rims on time calculate
ed. from the movement oi stars,
an one on color, or sun time,”
Gale explained.

Since the abolishing of the as
tronomy courses at Grinnell in
1924, the siderial clock has not
been used, since it could be set

been in constant use since 1888,
and no repair work has been need~

Requiring-

long metal weights. As the
springs unwind, the weights are
lowered in the body of the clock.
Tightening of the springs again
lifts the weights. “That’s the exe
planation for clocks runing down
and being wound up,” onto said.

As for the zero hour, murder
mysteiy fans have probably guess—
ed it is midnight, Gale said. Scionce
is the real explanation, however.
for scientific clocks use a 24»houl‘,
rather than a 12—hour face. This
is to avoid adding ‘a, m.‘ and ‘p.
m.‘ to hours.

Dr. Ruth Alexander, outstand-

-———-)

mouS beauty, will present the
initial lecture of the college con—
cert and lecture course in the
high school auditorium.

Daughter of a doctor of eco~
iioinics and a concert pianist, Dr.
Alexander has achieved success in
the fields of both her parents. She
made both her musical debut and
her initial economics lecture from
the same platform in Town Hall,
New York.

Despite repeated offers for a
career in music and the theatcr,
Dr. Alexander chose political ewe
nomics for her field. An expert
on Marxism, she did the work
for her doctor’s degree in that
subject.

Speaking on “Education for
Freedom," she will attempt to de—
fend democracy by defending the
capitalistic theories she believes
are its mainstay. 0f theories for
planned economy she is particular-
ly critical, believing that it is a
part of man's nature to repeat in
cycles the economic patterns he
has followed for 6,000 years, do-
spitc their proven weaknesses.

No ardent feminist, Dr, Al
ender nevertheless believes mar»
riage and a career can and do
mix happily. Wife of a prominent
Chicago business exec“ ivc, she is
the mother of two children. She
was married during her under-
graduate days, and did not take
her advnnced ivo k at college un-
til :Lttel' both children were born.

Suit will he brought

dent.

At a meeting this often
noon, negotiations failed.
and Spencer said he would
tum tho nuittcr over to
court authorities.

$25 SeHlemeni'
Fee Spurned
By Coni'rac’ror

An alternative of paying $55 dam—
ages or being the defendant in
a damage suit was offered to the
freshman class by E. E. Spencer,
Newton contractor, according to
James Chaffec, freshman class
president. The difficulty arose
over the taking of lumber by the

class on September 23 for a pep
rally at the college, Chaffee said.

Spencer demanded a payment
of 5100 for the lumber early in
October, and restated the demand
Wednesday. The police notified
Chaffee to meet Spencer immedi-
ately and arrange a settlement of
the matter.

At the meeting. which lasted
three hours, Spencer was offered
$25 in payment for the lumber.
The Newton contractor, however,
rejected the offer and stated that
he would accept $55 in cash for
his loss, Chaffee said.

Spencer claimed that approxi-
mately 2000 feet of lumber was
removed by the freshmen, and es-
timated that the value of the
lumber amounted to $50.

Denying the claim, the spokes—
men for the preps stated they
believed the figure was about
800 feet and that .325 should
settle the account satisfactorily,
in view of the fact that much of
the lumber was damaged by fire.

Spencer, however, denied that a
large portion of the lumber was
already damaged, and claimed
that the lumber taken would have
been worth 375 to $80 on the
open market

Police Chief Bell suggested that
an arbitrary board be appointed
to decide the matter, and Spencer
and the freshman officers agreed
to meet again today and act upon
this suggestion.
