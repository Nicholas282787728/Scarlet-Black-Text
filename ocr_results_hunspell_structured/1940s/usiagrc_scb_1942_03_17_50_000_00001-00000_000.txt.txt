Now Ezio Pinza

Famous Vocalis’r
Held On Enemy
Alien Charge

The war threatens to cause
another readjustment in the

Gl‘innell College Lecture and’

Recital Series.

First Alexander Woollcott was
unable to keep his date in Grin—
nell because of government activ-
ities in connection With the war,
and now comes the announcement
that Ezio Pinza, Metropolitan
grand opera hasso, scheduled to
appear in recital here on .Apl‘il.
29, has been seized in New York
and is being detained on Euis
Island as an enemy alien.

Pinza is an Italian and his re
peated assertions that he is a
friend of Mussolini are said to
have resulted in his detention.

Whether he will be able to fill
his booking in Grinnell is prob-
lematical.

Bulb Would Burn

|29 Years On Elecfrici’ry

By Allen Arney

it would have to be a perpetual
electric light bulb, but onwould
burn for 129 years on the idle-
watt hours of electricity used by
the college last month-when es,-
437 kilowatt hours were consum-
ed. I,

The month before the college
used enough steam energy to pro-
,pell a fully loaded, 100 car,
freight train with a normal Slxed
locomotive, for 200,000 miles.

In addition the college in the
last ten years has used enough
electricity to keep the same so
watt light bulb burning for
3,073 years, and also enough
steam to propell the some train

Used Lasl Mon+ll

101‘ 85,000,000 freight miles.

With the electricity used in
February all the cars in the
United states could be turned
over for two minutes on a sub-
zero, winter morning. For the
men who shave with electric
razors it might be interesting to
know that 150 of them can shave
for, four minutes on one kilowatt
hour of electricity, and that 9,—
815,550 of them could each shave
for four minutes on the electricity
that was used last month.

Whereas, in the preceding
month enough heat energy was
used to take everybody in the
world to the top of the 1200 foot
Empire state building in New
York City.

Cleveland Wins
Dance Contest;
James Second

Cleveland cottage won first place
at the annual Women's dance ine
tramurnl staged in the gym last
night. Second place went to
James. The respective themes of
the winers were “Keep It Clean,"
representing the Housekeeping de»
partment, and “Ex Libris," pre-
senting a library scene.

The themes of the other cot-
tages which did not place were
based on the war. Crinnell through
the years, the Crinnell College
Bulletin, and a prep at Criuncll.

The setting for Cleveland's
dance was a sudent's room which
was untidy because of the “coke”
bottles, filled waste baskets, and
various colored curtains in it.

College girls entered but disap—
peared when Mr. Jackson, Miss
Gardner and Mrs. Ferguson ap-
peared on the scene. Mr. Jackson
immediately began to improve the
situation, sending maids. janitors,
and scrub women to clean the
room. .

The final dance was the work-
ers winding Mr. Jackson up in
red tape in Maypolc fashion which
is unwound before the lights go
out.
