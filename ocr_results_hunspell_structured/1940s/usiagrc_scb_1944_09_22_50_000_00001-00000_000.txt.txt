Sirong, Bauman. Charl‘l'on
Siudy Ve‘l‘eransl Educa‘l‘ion

A committee on veterans’ education, with Dean Earl D.
Strong as chairman, has been appointed by Dr. Samuel

Stevens, college president.

Other members of the com—

mittee are Frederick Baumann and Joseph Charleton, vet—

erans of the first world war.

The committee’s work is to far
nuliarize itself WiLh government
regulations, direct advice to vet-
ei-ans interested in coming to

Grinnell, and help them with any-‘

thing possible after they have
registered at college. The facule
ty voted Monday, Dean strong
stated, to admit veterans once
each month if they wish to en-
roll. Thus, at any time during
the year we may be receiving
them. Under that plan, if a vet~
eran should arrive one month‘late,
he will take three courses in-
stead of four. Depending on how
late he arrives, he will take a
lesser number of courses, ranging
from four to one.

The government gives college
assistance to those who have re—
ceived honorable discharges from
the service, with the exception of
those in the merchant marine.

H. PrescoH To Produce

When Grinnell Again
Takes Down Airways

Returning to the air after a year
of inactivity, the college radio
station is planning its broadcasts
to give a representative picture
of the Grinnell campus. A sec-
ond purpose of these radio pro-
grams is to give the students of
Grinnell who are interested in
radio an opportunity to gain exe
perience in the fields of radio anv
nouncing, entertaining or engi-
neering.

Mr. Herbert Prescott, director
of publicity and producer of the
radio programs, said that he is
anxious to utilize the talent found
on our campus to benefit both the
college and the individual stu-
dents.

Arrangements have been made
with station WOI at Ames for a
Grinnell broadcast every Tuesday
afternoon, from 4:15 to 4:45. Al—
though the actual starting time
has not yet been decided, pro
grams will be under way by the
middle of October, Tentative ar-
rangements have been made with
WHO, Des Moines, for a program
to be given by Grinnell once a
month, beginning in December.
Plans are also being formulated
for programs on other radio Sta—
tions.

Mr. Prescott is new to the cam-
pus this year, having replaced
Thomas Duncan as instructor in
journalism and director of pub-
lieity.

Frye Appointed
Assistant Editor
Of 1945 Cyclone

Mary Enid Frye, Haines junior,
has been appointed assistant ed-
itor of the 1945 Cyclone, Barbara
Buckley, editor, announced to
day.

other members of the junior
class on the staff are: Geri-y
Warren, Haines, art editor; Dou-
ise Mayer, Haines, junior editor;
Constance Rounds, Bead, photog.
raphy editor; Barbara Takahashi,
Hadnes. and Virginia Johnston,
Read, organizations editors. Anne
Hellebusch, Read sophomore, is
copy editor, and Marjorie Nunn,
Haines senior, is senior editor.

“The staff is not yet complete
ed,” Miss Buckley emphasized.
“Any enterprising rreshmen and
sophomores will be welcomed to
the staff as copywriters."

College assistance for veterans
falls into two categories, as role
lows:

Disabled veterans may secure
from the government tuition, fees,
books, supplies, up to $500 per
year, plus :in amount, dependent
upon the person's degree of di
ability, [or maintenance. This
iomount is usually more than nd-
equate to pay expenses at Grin»
nell, Dean Strong stated.

Vctenuis without any disability
may receive up to $500 per year
for tuition and ices, plus $50 per
month for maintenance. If he
has a dependent, he can get $25
a month more. The length of
time that a veteran can attend
college at government expense
depends upon his length of serv-
ice. Thus, he would receive as
many months of education as his
period or service, plus one year.
