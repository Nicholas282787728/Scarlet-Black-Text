For Ge+—Toge+her

Abandoning the remote sulniru-
an meeting place, of the past tivo
years, the niinuiil Christmn, va-
cation get-together of Gr nell
students living in the Chicago
area has tentatively been set for
Tuesday. Dec. 28, at Tony’s on
Rush street.

Unable to settle on more our
trally located and larger meet-
ing place, Chicago area students
who discussed the party selected
Tony's as jumping off spot for
the evening's activities.

7 According to present plans, in»

. dividuai parties should make
their oivn reservations at Tony's
for that evening, although the
Tuesday evening date has been
selected with the idea that it
will be an “off night" and less
crowded.

Students with alternate sug-
gestions to a rendezvous point for
the getrtogether should contact
