C Drake Relays Queen.

. An item in Harlan Miller‘s column Monday
morning stated that a Texas girl had been
chosen again as queen of the Drake Relays.

And so another Texas beauty is awarded
the crown.

Somehow, this whole business of Drake‘s
heaping beauty awards on girls south of the
Mason-Dixon line should signify something.

Does it mean that Iowa girls just “ain’t
got it" when they come up against the
honey—draw} of the South?

ls sugar cane a better beautifier than
corn?

Or is someone at Drake passionately fond
of the deep South“.7 .

We don’t know either. But we think that

0 Federal Action.

The government is moving in to protect the
civil r'g‘hts of Negroes.

This action was taken because of the
failure of several southern states to give to
the Negro the status allowed him in the
federal constitution

ln Missouri, a Negro was tortured and
killed by a mob after the state grand jury
had failed to indict him on a charge of as—
sault against a white woman

Three operators of turpentine stills in
Georgia are charged by the government 01'
holding Negroes in their employ in a state
of slavery.

All aged Negro in Texas was lynched
after being denied equal protection under
the law.

Police in Georgia branded a Negro youth
with a hot iron in order to extort a con-
fessiml.

These cases, along with similar cases in
Kentucky, Florida, and Arkansas, have
caused the government to intervene in the
Negro question.

Such attitudes on the part of states and
individuals against minority group within
our country is thoroughly despicable. We
are fighting the Nazis and the Japanese
because our ideology is opposed to their
ideology of hatred and suppression. Yet
such hatreds and suppressions exist in the
United States.

The action of the government on this
score is commendable.

Don’t Rush Into Marriage In

That young people should not rush
into marriage in this nstionsi
emergency is the contention of
Dr. Harriet O’Sbea, associate pro-
fessor of psychology at Purdue
university, expressed in her dis-
cussiun 0n “Wartime Marriages"
Monday afternoon.

There are three main points
which enter into the Consideration
of msnricgc: ccch party must be
emotionally mscui-c, psychological-
ly wcsncd, and basically congenial.

For these reasons the couple
must have shared c long acquain-
tance and know each other and
various people in a. variety of
situations, in order to bc sa-
tisfied that each has the same in-
terest in recreation and value,
she stated.

Miss O'Shea's answers to
questions at the and of her talk
revealed that shc believes there
is no danger of personality chan-
ges, dcvclopcd if the man must
serve in the armed forces, inccc
fering with the marriage, if the
couple is well adjusted in the bc-
ginning. Rather, such changes
should enrich the relationship, shc

asserted.

“A family is a good thing if Lhe
wife is financially secure and ss-
tisfactory arrangements can be
made for a child. A man is bet-
ter off if he can come back to a
wellrcstcblishcd home. Our pres-
ent social premium, ‘men must
support the women,’ is bad. Wos
man should be willing to sup
port herself and her husband”,
she concluded.

"Young people should consider the
opposite sex as human beings,

stand how they feel,” Dr. Har-
rict O'Shea, associate professor of
psychology at Purdue University

cial budget tea in Main drawing
room at four o'clock,

Speaking on the social problems

said.

Students should have friendly

she said, rather than limiting
themselves to one person for their

Fear and Anger

To Breakdown

In sddi-cssing the freshmen hyr

Prep Halls - -

Continued from page 1

of one freshman who almost fa
ed, but, because the upperclass»
men in the hall took him in
hand, he "snapped out of it," and
now makes average grades,

Ksloupck brought up the point
that. most colleges have freshman
halls because of the fraternity
rushing system.

“Harvard found that freshman
houses did more to stabilize the
student body than anything else
in her 300 year history,” Stevens
claimed.

Stevens cited the Board of
Trustees as insisting that
something be done about the
men’s housing system, and
that house government had
fallen down on the job.

The factor of the war was also
brought into the discussion last
night. ‘

Planning for about 150 fresh-
man men, Stevens said that at the
bcgnming of the year there would
probably be about 100 upperclass-
men here, and that during the
course of the two semesters, most
of the seniors and juniors would
be drafted.

“This would leave sopho-
mores in charge of fresh-
man,” he pointed out,
showing that house leader—
ship would be “shot 60
pieces.”

William Van Duzer, Rawson
president, brought up point blank
the question of whether or not
all freshman would be put in
separate halls.

“rll be open minded in this
case of freshman houses vs. stat-
us quo," Stevens said.

Then he proposed a com-
promise plan.

“Let me take Cowles and
Langan, making them how I
want them. We‘ll take in or—
der of registration the first
45 freshman and put them
in Cowles. We‘ll take the
next 33 and put them in Lani»
gala. All the rest 01" the
freshman will be evenly dis
tributed around the rest of
the halls. Then we'll have a
little friendly competition.

“Demonstrate that you
give good guidance, and in
the future I’ll organize
Oowles in the regular fash-
ion.”

A temper tantrum is a symp-
tom of breakdown, Miss O’Shea
said, and it comes as a result of
not having the poise to handle
non-familiar situations.

Miss O‘Shes concluded by say-
ing that we spent 95% of our
time with other people and urged
that everyone hunt for pleasing
and agreablc traits and overlook
disagreeable ones in all acquain—
tcncss.

Ezio Pinza, Metropolitan grand

by the government from his in<
temment on Ellis Island, accord-
ing to a report received by Fres-

The government has found am-

him, stcvcns said.

Pinza, who was scheduled to
appear here April 29 on the Grin-
