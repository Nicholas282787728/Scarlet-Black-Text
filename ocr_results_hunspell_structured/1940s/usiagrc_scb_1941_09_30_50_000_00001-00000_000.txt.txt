Sale of Special-rate Drake
game tickets had hit the 150
mark Monday afternoon, ac-

cording to G Lester Duke,
athletic director,

sale of a 300 minimum must
be completed by Wednesday noon,
Duke said, if the plan is to go
through,

“We have been working all
summer to get these special rates
from Drake," he added. ”I com
sidcr it one of the most impor-
tant measures that has been 01‘s
fci-cd to ‘Grinnell students, and
its failure would signify a great
blow to our renewed Crinnell

spiiit."

Students considering attending
the Drake game in smaller groups
or by other transportational
means, were urged to participate
in the special arrangements,

"The presentation of a, united
student body will mean a lot
more to the boys than scattered
rooting sections,” Duke said.

The $2.35 tickets, a single fee
covering both game admittance
and r oad transportation to
and from Des Moines, are on
sale by special hall and cottage
representatives and in the trees
urer's office.
