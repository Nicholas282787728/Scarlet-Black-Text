GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Know Your Grinnell

By Morris Cook

Cheering the colors scarl'et and
hlack has been a Grinncll tradi-
tion loi years; howevei it hasn't
always been the good fortune of
Grinncll students, especially the
sc. to he proud of the
school color for PINK was the
Grinnell coloi in the 1890's. Fink
athletic suits were in, and there
were maiiy who wanted a change.

Tile students on the campus in.
sistcd on a new color. To the
athlete, pink wasn't a fit shade
for athletic suits and in many
other ways it was a failure as a
college color. There was ridicule
from the opposition on the play-
ing field, Because of the appar
ent need for a change, a come
mittee was rot-med to choose a
new color for Cri-nnell. They
wanted to get away from the
weak and neutral fading pink.

The class of 1395 called theme
selves the revolutionary reformers

‘lTlley weren't lebclllous, so they
out but according to a bio—
graphical history 0[ the class,
they started many ncw procedures
iii their timcisuch as smoking
on the campus, taking their
athletic teams out of state, and
holding parties and picnics with-
out chaperOHSr—but the question
of the pink was their special
charge.

The student population assert-
ed ltselt and in an old issue of
the former student magazine,
lhiit, we find the following quotes,
“It is With no ordinary pleasure
that the Unit announces that the
weak neutral color pink, selected
so liaphazai-dly only a fer. years
ago, gives place hereafter to such
strong virile colors as scarlet and
black . . let us one and all
strive to make the scarlet and
black mean in the west what the
crimson, blue, and the orange and
hlack, mean in the east."

qiintely.
Staging

As would be expected. the stag;
ing was identical for the two
nights of the play, and deserves
fnvorahle comment for its orginal-
ity. Stage and property crews
adeptly redecorated the Moons
light livmg room for each act.

The make-up went a long way
toward transforming college stuA
dents into mature men and was
men, and in cases of Tom and
Minnie, a doddering old man and
woman.

Costumes presented no apparent|

difficulties except for the differ-
ence in height hetween Marjorie
Kraft and Kathleen Moorhead,
which resulted in corresponding
differences in length of gowns,
