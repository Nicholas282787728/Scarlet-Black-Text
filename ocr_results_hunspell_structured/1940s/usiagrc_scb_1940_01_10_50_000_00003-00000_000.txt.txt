Grinnell’s New Year’s Resolutions
Follow Usual Lines with Variations

By Robeltd O’-Hal “I.

bHele we come, iii-lo, wearing our
Christmas presents and bearing
our New Yezu's resolutions. Your
inquiring reporter has been about
the campus investigating the
whys and wherefores of 1940 res-
olutions; mainly why they are
made and wherefore are they
.broken.

Kay Stone voices the resolu-
tions made by the n‘lz‘ijol‘lty of
girls at the quad, to study ﬁrst
and date afterward. This resolu-
tion will also be broken by a large
majority, according to previous
statistics. Perhaps a more sensi—
lole miss was Bette Lee Dobry.
who, steadfast in her belref that
her resolution will riot be broken,
has said that she will not study
as hard as she hasn't been.

Jean Castles worrt resolve this
year to be a better girl becartse
she's been domg it for
ten years and look what it got
her. She has sprouted a wing al-
ready and she says it's mighty

, awkward.

Caroline Bludoi'n has resolved
tadv.) not to censor copy toi the
next Zephyr so conscientiously

Ody says he is going to study
more and quit :tunllillg around so

, much. He would'nt tell his other
resolutions because he was afraid
of breaking them. Evidently he
expects to keep the first two,
Miss Kathyrn Smith of the
dean’s office read that a psychia—

, trist declares if a person can’t
make himself too the mark during
the year that it’s no use to make
New Year's resolutions. (M
Smith didn’t’ make any. Ab al

Max Shelton refused to resolve,
and the preps hope fewenﬂy that
he won't in the future, All Grin—
nellians resolve that when bigger
and better field houses are bruit,
Grinnell will build 'Bm, so with
Ahoya! and three Yeah Bosltz
here we come 1940.
