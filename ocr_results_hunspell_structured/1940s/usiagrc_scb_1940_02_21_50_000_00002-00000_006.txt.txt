When Gopher Students Wanted Thrills They Traveled

To Winter Spo ts via T atn

Eleven hundred college students on one train is not
a picnic for the railroaders running that train—but
it was more than just a picnic lot the University ol
Minnesota collegians who jammed themselves and
their winter sports equipment into the cars [or a recent
outing trip to small-town Glenwood City, Wiseonsin.
Between the coming and going trips that harrassed
the railroaders with collegiate pranks, the winter
sportsmen played hard and enjoyed the hospitality
of villagers who did everything lor them horn easing
their lrostbites to feeding their empty stomachs. Here
is a picture-story of the fun trip that was a climax to
the Gophers' second annual Snow Week.
