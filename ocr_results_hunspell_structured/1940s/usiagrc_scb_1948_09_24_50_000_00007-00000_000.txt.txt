But to Leonard Johnson, vct»i

Nor was Mr. Johnson then, nor‘
is he now, worried about puts,
ting together the thousands of
pieces in the m-ton instrument.
“Building an organ is just Like
building a house," he said in an
interview. “You just start at
the bottom and work up. We've
got blueprints, and some of the
parts are numbered. But I can
just look at ’mast any piece and
tell you what it is\and where
it goes."

Band. Orchestra. Chair
Search For New Talem‘

Tryouts for participation in the
college band, orchestra, and choir
were held Wednesday afternoon in
the music building.

Anyone interested in playing in
either the band or the orchestra
during the coming year, and ivhoi
did not try out on Wednesday, may'
contact Mr. Kenneth D. Simmonsi
or Mr. Otto T. Jelinek, associate’
professors of music.

Although the band is parLiCu-i
larly in need of oboe, trombone,
and saxophone players, there are
openings in every section of both
band and orchestra.

The college band, under the di-
rection of Mr. Simmons, made its
first appearance at the allrcollege
convocation yesterday morning.

The new organ, a gift or Pres-l
ident and His. Samuel N. Stew‘
ens, vice President and Mr
Louis G. Chrysler, and Mrs. Gag-‘
lalcne Sloltenbeig, is being iii-
tallcd in completely rellovaled‘
Herrick chapel. Formal re-dcdi-
cation of the chapel and (ladies;
tioii of the organ will be held
during the tall, and the whole
academic year will leaturc spec-
ial organ events, including res

the committee arranging 'tlle

The instrument will have three

manuals and 3,542 pipes. There
are four divisions, including the
positive, with 59 ranks and 61
voiccs. An electronic bass will
furnish the eoiivalent ot threei
azrtoot stops, with so notes. Thel
chimes have 25 tubes, the cdicstc
and-hard 49 bars.
Only half of the organ had
arrived in the first shipment ——
nevertheless it required a full
day’s work from 10 men to
carry the mountain of parts into
the chapel.

But the arrival of the remain-
der of the organ this month
wasn’t all that Johnson had oni
his mind. “In a ’few weeks,” he
sai ”we'll send for a tuner:
Hell work along with us, tuning
and regulating, and he’ll need at
least three weeks."
