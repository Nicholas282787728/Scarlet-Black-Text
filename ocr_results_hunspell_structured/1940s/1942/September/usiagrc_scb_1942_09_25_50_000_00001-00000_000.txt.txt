Students Come
From l5 States
And a Territory

Gasoline rationing may have
cut down the extent of vacation—

men students at the college came
from 15 states and Puerto Rico.

Army Not Listed
ln '42 Herd Book

No army personnel will be in-
eluded in the 1942 Grinnell stu-
dent directory, Miss Bethana Mc-
Candless, registrar, said yestere
day in describing the new herd
book.

The customary address infor-
mation will be given about both
faculty and Students in the dir
rectory, which will be released
about October 15,

Following the plan adopted last
year, the herd book will be mime
eogi-aplied in the college service
bureau.

 

Even The

Crocuses Are Victims

Everyone is making sacrifices to
the war effort these days. . .the
biology department of Grinnell
college not excepted. So says Dr.
Henry s. Conard, chairman of the
department and professor of hot—
any.

The rows of crocuscs that once
bordered the south and east walls
of the “Y" building disappeared
the other day. Circumstances
prove that they were dug up by
workmen during the process of
constructing new calssrooms in
the basement of the building.

“One day the flowers were here,
and the next they were gone."

10% War Effort

said Dr. Conard. ”We didn't
know a thing about it until it
was all over.”

Grinnell men have gone into
the armed forces, Grinnell women
have taken up first aid courses
and knitted for the Red Cross,
students and faculty members
have bought war stamps and
bonds, and the army has taken
over half the campus. Now the
biology department has donated
its crocuses,

"Out of sight, out of mind,"
Dr. Conard sighed. “We still have
the flowers along the south wall
of the chapel.“

The Grinnell Honors, $500 scholars
ships granted for the last two
years to incoming studentshave
been replaced by three classes
of awards of the same value
from the Younkei‘ family in Des
Moines, Pres. Samuel N. Stevens
said last night.

The new awards, loioivn as
the Marcus Yoiuiker, Edith
C. and Esther Younker, and
and Annie Berkson Younker
scholarships, follow the plan
of the Grinnell HonorsThey
are awarded on the basis of
a nation-wide competitive ex-
:tminftﬁon each spring, and
are rcueunhlo throughout the
student’s college career.

The Mamus Younker scholar
ship for men provides four 3500
awards this year, with the other
two scholarships each giving that
amount to two women students.
This Year's Recipients

Three freshman, four sopho-
mores, and a junior transfer
student who entered Grinnell on
the Honors scholarships are now
recipients of the Younker award.
They are John Spencer and James
Kaufman, sophomores; John Pere-
goy, freshman, and philip Hal-
lie, transfer from Herzel junior
college, who have received the
Marcus Younker prize; sophomor-
es virginia Foote and Patricia
Abbott, the Annie Berkson Younk-
er scholarships; and Jessie and
Virginia Johnston, the Edith c.
and Esther Younkcr scholarships.
Number to Increase

single change in the old Grim
nell Honors plan is me increase
in number of scholarships offered.
Eight grants will be made next

Triple Threat
Kaufmann Joins
Pioneer Squad

Playing on a field thoroughly
soaked by an all day drizzle, the
Grinnell Pioneers will open their
1942 grid season tonight against
Monmouth's Fighting Scots. Both
teams are members of the Mid-
west Conference.

AuoLher late development was
Coach Douglas' announcementlast
night that Jim “TEX" Kaufman,
triple threat back on last year's
freshman football team will be
able to play in Friday night‘s
opener with Monmouth. A knee
injury has kept Kaufman from
practice.

Thursday Douglas took Kauf~
man to the University Hospiml
in Iowa City for a special X-my
examination of the sophomores
right knee, injured doling last
year's basketball SEaSOH, and the
doctors pronounced his knee heal—
ed enough to allow hilm to play.

Kaufmann will give Douglas
both a kicker and a. passer in case
Nagel should be injured, in ad-
dition to Jack McGrane.

However, Douglas warned that
Kaufman will probably not be
used much in tonight's game,
since he has not been practicing
and must be careful of his knee.

Because of the small size of
this year's squad, Douglas has
been avoiding much contact work
