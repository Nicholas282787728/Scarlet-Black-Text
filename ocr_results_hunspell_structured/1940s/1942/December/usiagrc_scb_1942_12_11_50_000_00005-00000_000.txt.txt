Wings
v--HeIps 'em Fly

You Won't wear a pair of silver
wings; there isn’t much glory
connected with it; but there's a
big job for college students who
wish to prepare themselves for
the new army and navy pre-
ineteorology program

In line with the pr am, a
course in that subject is to be
instituted at Grinnell next sem-
estcr, Grant 0. Gale, associate
professor of physics, has ana
nounced. “It will be an elemen-
tary descriptive course, rather
than one of laboratories and pro-
blems," he said. “Emphasis will
be placed on the reading and iii-
terpreting of weather maps."

Although no prerequisites will
be required, students with one
semester of physics will be able
to use that training.“ he said.
The new course will probably be
placed in group five, classes
meeting at 3:45 a. in. on Tues-
days and Fridays and 10:45 a.
m. on Mondays and Thursdays.
