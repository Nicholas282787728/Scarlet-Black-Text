the weakest section ,and they lost
their first few games. Lately,
however, they have won more
consistently.

oh the other hand, the Gates
ten, having lost its pitcher and
heaviest hitter, Hart, has shown
several weak spots. As a result
the townnicn will probably re-
place Gates as one ot the favor—
