CURRICULUM

Sink Slaves Wipe 3000 Dishes Daily

By Al Arney

The slaves to a sink, who wipe
dishes in the quadrangle and dor—
mitory kitchens, dry more dishes
for onc meal than the average
housewife wipes in fivc months,
the they sponge off four times
as many in one dzty as the aver—
age wife does in a year.

With approximately 300 students
in each of thc dormitory systems,
and two skullcry slaves wiping- all
the dishes in each kitchen, ap—
proximately 1200 dishes are wipcd
alter supper and lunch. and a
slightly smaller number after

breakfast.

All in all the salivary glands of
600 students overflow and clean
the tasty morsels from about 15
million dishes each school year,
which in turn have to bc racked,
rinsed, and shoved through the
ancient washers to the automatic
motions of the dish wipers hands;
not to speak of the pots and pans
that are burned, bottorcd and
scoured day after day, or the
glasses which end up clean, but
spotted after cvci-y meal, These
would wear the average llollsc~
wife-s finger bones to thc marrow
for 525 mcals, without allowing

her to change the diapers on the
baby, or have excess breakage by
hefty tosses at her husband.

Each wiper has the personal
satisfaction of knowing that he
has probably wiped more dishes
in his short career of toil ovcr
the chins racks than his mother
has had in her complete culinary
pursuits. This will no doubt give
him courage to know that the
experience will be of great aid to
him when he has a little sink of
his own and will only have 25
dishes per meal to wipe for his
wifc instead of 1200 here at his
four year homestead.
