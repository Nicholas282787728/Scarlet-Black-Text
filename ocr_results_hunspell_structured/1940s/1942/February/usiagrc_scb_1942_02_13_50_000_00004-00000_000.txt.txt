Swimmers Leave for Chicago for
Meet With Strong Loyola Team

 

Led by co—eaptains Bob Jensen and
Bob Stewart, nine Pioneer swim-
mers will meet two opponents on a
road trip this week end.

This morning the squad left for
Napewille, 1ll.. where they meet
North Central college tonight. To-
mormw they meet the Loyola
swimmers in Chicago.

According to Coach Marty
O'Connor, the Loyola team is ex-
ceptionally strong, However, in
only one meet so far has the
strength of the Pioneer team been
tested. Loyola should be their
toughest opponent to date.

The spectacular perfomances of
John Giles, sophomore free styler,
have featured each of Grimell’s
victories and should be repeated
this week end. -

Despite the loss of Mark Alley
and Jim Runge to the squad, the
addition of Bill Findley, Sid
O’Neil, and Hugh Blair has made
the team better balanced, Ste-
wart, Jensen and Dud Conner have
consistently hettered their own
records in each meet and there is
no indication of their slowing
down.
