Spring Football
Draws 23 Gridders

, Squad Cu+ by
Track Turnout
Claims Douglas

Twenty-three football pros-
pects are now reporting daily
for Spring practice on the
soggy hill 01‘ Mchachron
field. Coach Ben Douglas said
that the squad is unusuadly small
because most of the letter men are
on the track team.

Six New Men.

Six men reported to Douglas for
the first tilne this week These
included Val Schoenthal and John
Shoemaker, ends; Doanc Hakes, a
tackle; Phil Southworth and Tex
Kaufmann, backs“, and John Miller,
guard. Miller was a reserve last
season and is a junior. The other
five were members of last fall's
freshman squad.

Douglas is being assisted this
spring by Louis Gonias, 1941 cap-
tain, who is handling the line
coaching duties.

No Scrimmage.

Most of the work'so far has
been on grid fundamentals with a
good deal of basic conditioning.
Generally there have not been
enough players for intra-Squzld
scrimmage; so practices have been
confined to signal and passing
drills. The line and back field com-
binations are usually shifted every
other play.

Grid letter men who are now on
the track team are Tod Kennefick,
Harry Waters, Lefty ,Sory. Ed
Nagel, Curly Bishop, Murray
Richards, Augie Gruening, and Joe
Dykstra.

sored by Grinnell college will give

3 p. m. in the high school audi-
torium under the direction of

Oskaioosa, Toledo and Grinnell,
coached by prominent musicians in
each city, rehearse weekly at home
and assemble during the week be-

all the communities of central
Iowa.

Too Many Workers
Cause Red Cross
Ma'lerial Shorl'age

Shortage of Red Cross sewing
material is due to the number of
volunteer workers, according to
Mrs. Morgan, head of Puweshiek
county’s distribution

Each county is allotted a certain
amount of material in each ship—
ment and when that is gone, no
more can be secured until the next
regular shipment.

Since war was declared, over
1000 Poweshiek county women
have signed up, and there is not
enough work to keep all of them
busy all of the time, Mrs, Morgan
said,

Actually there is no shortage of
material but an over abundance of
workers.
