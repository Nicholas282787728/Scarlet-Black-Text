Pioneers Will Oppose
Nine Mid-Wesl Teams:
Cancel Seahawk Games

Grinnell opens a lﬁrgame basket-
ball schedule December 7, against
Iowa state in the new gym. Two
games with the Iowa Seahawks
Which were to be played immed-
iately preceding and followlng
Christmas vacation have been
cancelled because of the Sea-
hawk's decision to drop varsity
basketball. However, these gaps
probably will be filled to bring
the total number of games up to
15, G. Lester Duke, athletic dire
ector said yesterday.

As it stands the schedule calls
for nine conference games and
four non-Conference games. Be-
sides the opening clash with Iowa
state, the crinnell cagers will
face the Drake Bulldogs twice in
non-conference competition.

The schedule is as follows:

Condilioning To Include
Wreslling And Baskel‘ball

The regular schedule of condi-
tioning classes, consisting of exer-
cises, climbing the ,wall, and
rough house basketball is going
to change next week, according
to John c. Truesdale, professor
of physical education. Hereafter,
there will be a five minute exer-
cise period followed by conven-
tional basketball and wrestling at
the north end of the gym, car-
ried on simultaneously. Now that
the dividing net has arrived, se—
parating the two basketball
courts, two basketball games can
be readily played at once.

Besides these activities. ads
vanced swimmers may swim
twice a week for conditioning cre—
dits in place of the beginning
swimmers whose swimming class<
es have just ended.

Dibble Keeps
Record Clean

Close lnlramural iRace
Wifh 25- 0 Win Viciory
Over Gales Gridders

Dibble kept its unmaten record
clear last Friday when they
pounded a listless Gates team all
over the field to wind up the in-
tramural football season with a
2570 wind.

Neither team scored in the first
quarter, but in the second period
Dibble broke loose for two count-
ers. Early in the stanza Hal Rob—
ison broke loose for 40 yards and
a touchdown, and on the last
play of the game, Chuck Gee re»
ceived a Gates punt on his goal
line and cutraced au Gates dea
fenders to score.

In the third quarter, Dibble
added another touchdown to their
string when Roblson passed to
Grover Milliken who went to the
one yard line. On the next play
another pass clicked to Dick Gad-
ient in the end zone.
