Cyclone Class
Collects Memoirs
For Library

The cyclone class of 1882, who
iield their 60th reunion here last
June, had and still has a college
and a class spirit hard to dupli-
cate, according to the memoirs of
that class, to be found in the
Gi-innell library.

Of that class there are 16 (11
men and five women) still living;
coch has contributed something
to the book. The memoirs are
bound in a notebook, containing
letters to the class from each
member, snapshots, news from
Grinnell, commencement programs
and souvenirs of the 60th reun-
ion.

Carefully prescrved is the coin-
mencement program for June 26,
1332. At that time separate com-
mencement exercises were held
for graduates of the “college
course," and graduates of the
"ladies course."

Chief features of the book are
two round robin letters circulated
by class members, both within
the last few years, by which they
have kept track of changes in
Grinnell.

Five Rubber Tires!

-—A Treasure In Wartime

By Lucia Carter

They aren’t giving away dishes
or playing bingo in Goodnow Hall
these days. That long line of stu-
dents panting with anticipation
at the door of the physics de-
partment are just waiting to see
aand even to touch—that ems
blem of the vanished America: an
unused automobile tire. Not one,
but five.

The hoarde is part of the equip—
ment on the Pontiac chassis dis-
played in the first floor hall.

“But the .tires are probably no
good for road use," Grant 0. Gale,
associate professor of physics,
muttered bitterly yesterday. “They
have never been used, but we
have had them since 1932, and
they are probably too old to be
serviceable."

“We considered turning the
whole car. including the tires, ov-
er to the government in the re—

cent scrap drive." Gale explained.
"but decided to keep it for its
instruction value.”

To justify themselves with the
war production board, however,
the physics staff raised an equiv-
alent 1,000 pounds of scrap for
the drive Oct. 13.

The auto chassis is mounted on
wooden blocks several inches from
the floor. and the tires have nev-
er touched the ground Gale said.
The car was a gift to Griruicll
from the Pontiac company in
1532.

With the patriotism of the
physics department having sues
cessfully repelled challenge, the
only suggestion on the part of
student war workers is that the
Goodnow hall lobby be made a
or uoissiurpe pu’E u'louq alum-ls 19M

actual enlistment ceremony, Best-
ty said,

Appointments To Be Made

Appointments for hour of en-
listment should be made in the
personnel office by Wednesday
night.

The process of being sworn in—
to the lERC~unassigned will take
an hour, Beatty said, and other
branches will vary, the Air Corps
reserves requiring four hours of
examinations and one hour for
the enlistment ceremony.

Documents Required

Beatty again stressed that men
planning. to enlist should have
all necessary papers with them on
Thursday. These include a ccrti<
ficste of physical examination,
birth certificate, and, if applicant
is under 21. the written consent
of his parents.

Men planning to enlist are ask-
ed to use the new south entrance
to the ‘Y' building.

Enlistment boards for the
Navy, including V1 V5 and v4
will be here for similar work on
Nov, 13.
