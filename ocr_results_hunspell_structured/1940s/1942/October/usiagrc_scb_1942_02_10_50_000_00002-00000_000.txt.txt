0 That Second Helping.

It’s been nearly two months since the war
started now. And it seems to us that the
effects can be seen in a good many ways.
But in reality We haven’t seen anything—
yet.

Schools the country over are being faced
with serious reductions in tuition income,
and are having to tighten their belts. We
feel that the students can do a lot to help

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the college tighten its belt.

We can do a lot of little things that
would mean so much, such as taking only
as much food as we really need. A tremen-
dous amount of butter, for instance, is left
on the butter plate just because somebody
didn’t think when they took it.

We run out of our rooms and leave the
lights burning or the water running. All
these, and many others, mount up terll
ally. We must economize.

Don’t take food you can’t eat.

Remember that in the trying days ahead,
your college as well as your country needs
your loyalty. Remember, it’s guns or but—
tor, and in this case there can be no ques-
tion.

0 It’s More Fun.

There are thousands of pleasant occupa-
tions, reading, stamprcollccting, picnics, etc.
Yet it is much more full to go ill for some-
thing had. Something really evil.

Studying is the one occupation to avoid
like “Hell fire." It gets you and then you‘re
done for good. You get too intellectual and
know the answers in class and all the kids
point at you and slleer.

In fact, why study at all? Spend more
time on an evil occupationirent a steady
booth at the E‘s, play poker all night-—
there are lots of them.

Passing? Sure you can pass easy on such
a schedule. Make a pony the (lay before the
test, copy from your neighbor, and ulti-
lnate of llltilndtes, get a hold of an exam
copy.

It’s THAT easy!

The coucgc radio studio was up

Iowa state College last Saturday

afternoon, according to Hcrschcl
M. Colbert, director of the studio.

March 1 is the dalc set for the

Announcers are nccdcd, and al-
so technical men to operate the
amplifiers in the studio. Anyone

The microphones and amplir
fiel's were matched to work toe

The cnginccrs said the initial
ccpupment was very good, and
thnt the college was very lucky
to obtain it. They stilessed the
point that it should be well cared
for, as it could not be rcplnccd

The smell of STUDENT COUN-
CIL elections that are approach-

date the acid in order to win the
vote of quaditcs.

JOE anGoEMAN claims to imvc
all the gels in the quad down on

Conducter Praise

In Band Concert

By Dave Meade

The Grinnell College Concert
Band. directed by Kenneth D. Sim-
mons, presented its initial concert
of the year last Sunday after-
noon in Herrick chapel.

The band played, in the opinion
of this commentator, better thnn
it had for several years and much
of Lhe credit for its success should
go to its conductor,

Two of thc nlunhers which were
performed especially well were the
first, Bach's “Prelude in 13 flat
minor" and the last, which had
the audience sitting on the cdge
of its seats, Gliere’s throbbing
“Russian sailor's Dance,"

Also deserving a great deal of
praise is Simmon's own composi-
Lion, “Theme and Variation "
This piece was not only well v
tcn, with finc instrumcntntlcn, but
was cxccllcnuy performed.

Although small in numhe the
