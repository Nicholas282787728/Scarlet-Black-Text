O Gusto.

The Baumann has always been in the habit
of roaring at his classes.

Sometimes we think he is experimenting
with the contagion of indigestion; some
times we think he is testing for sound. For
the most part, we are not sure, and that is
what he wants.

The Baumann, by creating confusion,
would force us to think.

The success of his methods is an often-

debated matter of opinion, but that success
is actually of only relative importance.
Whether or not it is a good thing, in this
case the man is more significantly memor<
able than what he has to say,

In fifty years no one will recall what wind
he blew into what weeds or wheat, but some
will remember the particular flavor of his
personality; some will remember, because he
said What he had to say with gusto.

In much the same manner, a school will
not be especially remembered for its admin-
istrative policies or for the courses that it
has offered. A college is made up of person-
alities; from personalities it derives its own
flavor. Even its buildings will be remember»
ed only in association with some of the
people who occupied them fora time.

Of those who make the effort to scratch
their initials on the surface of time, some,
possessing gusto, will always cut a little
more deeply than the rest and in inimitably
personal styles.

0 Good Luck, Marty.

It was a jolt to us to learn over the week-
end that Malty O‘Connor had departed from
Grinnell to take a new job as physical edu—
cation instructor with the army air corps.
We wish him all the good luck in the
world.

To write a tribute about a popular and
well~liked man is difficult The tribute
usually lacks sincerity or sounds like an
obituary.

Marty is a square shooter, a good sports—
man, and a man with fine principles. Grin-
nell‘s loss is the ‘Air Corps’ gain.

The main “defense course” which swept the country was of
the physical coudi om'ug type, Almost every school in the
country reports some kind of emphasis on physical condition-
iugr‘ Thatphysicul couditimg is an insufficient substitute for
baszc military training is clear. Further, several college cdil
tars report that studeut interest is pelcrihg out in these
courses, and close order drill and bayonet movements have
been introduced to uilolizc them.

College editors also report that their schools are teaching Japanese,
Portuguese, “mllltary German,” "military French,” Russian, Arabic,
Italian, and Turkish. Classes in crytography have already been intro-

duced in two schools and similar courses are slated to appear in six
Insure curricula. ‘

Psychology departments have inked on significance by offering “pre~
service" training in “military psychology,” “propaganda. psychology,"
“moral psychology” and the “psychological causes of war."

other courses reported to The Daily Maroon are “the sociology of
war,” “the economics of war,” “naval history," and “military his-
tory." Courses m navigation and meteorology are standard in almost
every curnculum. Highly specialized skill courses have heavy enroll-
ments 33o ege men are being trained in “quick computation methods,"
“ballistics ' “electronic chemistry,” "Pacific geography," “military car-
tography.” “aerial photography.” "practical telephony," “ship draft-
lng,” “first aid," “stress analysis," and "truck driving.”

In answer to the student and public demands for presin-
ductlon military training, the educational institutions have
offered these courses, but what they have not offered is
any assurance that the men taking these courses will ever
have the chance to use what they learn in the army.
