0 Faculty Follies.

Students in their senior year still recall
with fond delight the musical show present-
ed by the faculty in the spring of 1939. In
a pealllll’rsl‘lell, it was a howling success. It
should‘ be repeated.

We quote from a former Scarlet and
Black commenting on the ”Faculty Follies
of 1939‘"

“It was worth the price of admission, if
only to boo the faculty, to laugh at them,
and to be really entertained.”

“Freddy Baumilnn was exceptionally
effective as a prep who took snapshots
in class and ‘necked’ on A. R. H. steps.”

“It should be made an annual affair.”

We emphatically believe that there should
be a “Faculty Follies of 1942." The script
is still on hand, along with all of the prop-
erties. As an invaluable contribution to na—
tional and student morale, as an undertak—
ing promising a hilariously good time for all,
it should not fail to be given.

Faculty, this is a challenge. The show
must go on!

I Snowballs.

Ninty-nine snowballs out of every 100
thrown, fail to hit a window.

This startling discrepancy was shown this
week during a snowball barrage on ARH.

What if a basketball player missed 99
out of every 100 free throws‘.7

What if a bomber missed its mark 99
ollt of every 100 times?

We suggest that every Grinnell man who
feels the urge to break a few windows,
should practice at home first, so that his
lack of skill is not so glarillgly exposed
when he starts pitching at ARH.

The basketball team is in second place, and
coming up fast, The swimming team is
reputedly our best in many years. All of
which adds up to the fact that ill the heat
of war and exams some of us may have
forgotten that we have a pair of potential
champions on the campus,

On two successive weekends the bucket
boys have taken two rugged teams into
camp— pon and Beloit. At this point they
are tra' llg only Monmouth~and by one
game. of course, it is early to predict, but
we may have another trophy on the campus
come March.

Over at the pool records are falling right
and left such as we haven’t seen in recent
years. A team such as these boys and Marty
O’Connor have whipped together by long
and hard practice ought to get all the praise
and cheers in the World.

They deserve too the alleout suppolt of
the students at every meet.

ostentatious greatness of the per<
formance. Petri’s type of great-
ness is that exceedingly uncom-
mon greatness which is entirely
aware of itself, so aware that it
is no longer self~concicus and has
no need to resort to any tricks or
gestures to call attention to it-
self. And as always. there was no
possibility o is not being im-
mcdistely recognized and taken at
it tine Worth. In the intensity of
the musical experience one hardly
noticed the prodigious technique
that the pianist displayed and
unit, indeed, he himself seemed
not to notice. On Sunday the
musical experience was so over-
whelming actually that the and

ence even forgot its initial dissp-
pointment at not seeing the
eagerly awaited piano that the
college was to have acquired for
the occasion.

Perhaps most of us will agree,
after all, that the greatest music
and therefore the real high spot
of the weekend was on Sunday's
program: the Beethoven Sonata,
Opus no in A ﬂat major. And
surely no one was immune to the
lyric charm and brilliance of the
final group comprising Liszt
transcriptions of six Schubert
Hader. As encores Petri played
two other Liszt Works, the
twelfth Hungarian Rhapsody and
the transcription of the “Spinning
Song" from Wagner's "Flying
Dutchman." Musically less signifi—
cant than the earlier numbers on
the program, one Liszt composi-
tions would have amply demon-
strated why Pom deserves to be
known as s Liszt specialist had

celved by women at the mass
meeting Monday morning show
that Grinnell Women have s
marl-led interest in an auto

Eightyone students signed for
enrollment in the class if it should
be given, according to Statistics

The distinctly musical character
of the weekend gave n'se to much
pertinent musical thought among
Grinnellians, and at. least two of
the subjects of that thought merit
mention here. For one thing, we
would like to ask, as so many
listeners Sunday did, whether

Woollcoh‘, Still in England.
May Be Here April l7

Alexander Woollcott, famous lit-
erary personality scheduled to ap<
pear on the Grinnell concert and
lecture series April 17, is still in
England, according to last;
ports.

No definite information regard-
ing his planned Grimell appear-
ance can be obtained until his
return to this country, probably
at the end of this month, the

public relations department an-
nounced.

In.

there is any valid reason for the
tradition that insists on the
chronological arrangement of a
program and thereby decrees al-
most inevitably an arrangEment
than. is anticiimactic. Should one
listen to Liszt after Beethoven?
This question is not meant to ink
ply that all old music is better
ihcn all new music, but simply to
suggest the possibility that a pres
gram might well be arranged not
with meticulous attention to the
history of music but rather with
attention to criishc cited. and
with a pl‘oper regard for variety
and climax.

About the other subject of
thought there csn be little differ-
ence of opinion. Surely everyone
agrees that there is far greater
Value in having one first-rate on

there is in having a number of

of such a master as Egon Fetri

rangcmcllt by which that visit
could be extended over two days.

Music Show

Slows Down

'Slighily Nautical' May

Announces Funk '

Possible curtailment of some ex-
tra-curricular activities in order
to utilize time and money for
Grinnell's accelerated defense
scheduis is slowing work on
”Slightly Nautical," Derelict club
production, Catherine Funk, pro-
ducer, said yesicrdny.

Since the musical show is Grim
nell's newest cxtra-cun-ioular
event, it is most likely to be af—
fected by any activity cut, she
said.

Miss Funk emphasizes that no
restraining action has been taken
yet. "However, such curtailment
will probably be made voluntarily
by many organizations. The Dere~
list club cannot easily convert its
work into defense effort, but the
cast members are anxious to do
their part of the defense work
now being organized.

"Conferences wiui the regis<
tral‘ have shown the college pro-
gram will be unusually crowded
next semester with the new de-
fense activities, and such activi-
ties naturally take precedence
over our Show."
