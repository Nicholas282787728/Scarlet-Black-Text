GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Pioneers, Carls Play Saturday

Face Crucial
Tesl' In Midwest
Con‘Ference Race

By Jack Wile.

Grinnell's Pioneers, forced
into a second place tie by
their loss to Beloit last week
end, will attempt to maintain
their stand in the race for the
Midwest conference championship
when they face an undefeated
Carleton eleven Saturday after»
noon at Northtield, Minn.

Before last Friday night's game,
the Pioneers were ranked at the
top of the conference race with
an unmarred record. Carleton
was close behind with no losses
and one tie which ranked them a
half-game out of first place. Be-
ioit had not been considered Ame
of the toughest teams in the
league, but upsetting Grinnell
lifted them into second place with
the Pioneers. Thus. there are
three teams competing for top
honol’sicrinnell, Carleton, and
Beloit.

Raiter Stars.

The contest between Carleton
and Grinnell probably will be the
most important game in the con-
ference this weekend, because it
may decide the championship.
Beloit goes to Appleton, Wis., to
meet a low ranking Lawrence
eleven.

Carleton's narrow-inargined vic-
tory over Coe last week can be
credited to Captain Dick Raiter,
playing in the backfield for the
Carls. His contribution consist
ed of two 50 yard runs and a
place kick for a conversion point
which proved to be the margin of
victory. Raiter made the Little
All-American team last year and
will be the man for the Pier
neers to stop. Dennis Tufte,
sophomore reserve back for the
Carls, 15 another dangerous man.
He intercepted a Kohawks' pass
and out-distanced the defense to

score a touchdown. Carleton’s in-
terest in this game is more than
just for the sake of winning the
conference. In the two seasons
since coaches Wally Hess and Gus
Young took over their jobs at
Northfield, their teams have never
lost a game at home.

Crucial Game for Grinncli.

For the Pioneers, Saturday's
game will decide their fate as to
the conference crown. After los-
ing to Beloit, they now must
defeat both the Carls and Coe
in successive games in order to
stand alone at the top of the
league, Crinnell outweighs Carle-
ton, both in the line and in the
backfield and another sports writ-
er has rated the Pioneer back-
field more outstanding than any
other small school in the midwest.

Although the Crinnell eleven is
favored to come out on the top
side in this game, Coaches Ben
Douglas and Oliver Wagner are
not taking the Carls lightly. From
the opening whistle until the final
gun we‘ll see a contest between
two teams that are fighting for
a championship, with all of the
power that they can muster
thrown in to the fight.
