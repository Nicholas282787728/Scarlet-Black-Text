Capacity Crowd Fills Herrick Chapel To Hear Illinois
Symphony Orchestra Present Its Second Concert Here

By Henry Alden.

A capacity crowd filled the blar-
rick chapel last night to hear the
Illinois Symphony orchestra give
its second concert in Grinnell. If
one can judge by the amount of
applause, the members of the
audience were delighted by thc
performance; in fact, thcy u-erc
not satisfied until they had obs
tained a third cncorc at the close
of the program, Whether one pre-
ferred this year's or last year’s
concert depended primarily on
whether one preferred the com-
positions that were prcsented this
year or those that comprised last
year's offering. The orchestra
performed in much the same
fashion on both occasions; Ralph
Rose, this year’s conductor, even
in his gestures resembled his
predecessor, Izler Solomon, The

orchestra’s chief virtuc continues
to be the dash and enthusiasm
mm which it plays; its chief
Wenklicssiif anything so powers
ful can be called a “leakncssiis
its brass section.

The opening number was Md
zert's incomparable overture to
“The Marriage of Figaro,” played
with brilliance and verve, if per—
haps without the lightness that
is also ncccssary in the ideal ren-
dition. Not many programs can
live up to such a beginning. The
“big number” of the evening was
the Franck symphony. Except on
the rarest occasions, this inusicis
played in one of two fasliions- it
is marred either by Sacchal‘lllity
or by melodrama. Rose selected
the lesser of two evils by choos-
ing the latter course. As a re-
sult, this verbose symphony never

drugged, and there was apleasant
novelty in hearing the last move-
ment played with such dispatch.
Moi-e restraint in volume would
have improved the effect still fur»
thei. but as it was, even so (Iran
matic an interpretntioii did not
prevent at least one fair member
0[ the audience from continuing
hcr knitting without interruption
and without the drop of a stitch

Thc soloist of the evening- was
Jciiska Slcbos, ’celllsl, Miss Sler
hos played agreeably enough
Saiiit-Sacns' “Concerto No, 1, iii
A minor," music that even the
kindest critic must admit borders
on dullness. The rest or the pro-
gram, made up of a variety of
lively rhythmic numbers ranging

Stevens Hayes
Approve Plan

Peii’rion Requesls
2:30 to 4:30 p. m. and
. 0 to 9:30 p. m. Hours

A plan to open the college
library for four hours Sull-
day was recommended by the
Student Council, campus gov-
erning body, at its Weekly
meeting last night, it was
stated by Robert C, Young,
president

man Given.

The plan recommended by the
Council calls for opening the its
hrary from 2:30 to 4:30 p, m. and
from 7:30 to 9:30 p. m. on Sun-
days. The Councii felt there would
be no majority objection to clos—
ing the library on Friday nights,
if some question were raised Con-
cerning increased operating ex-
penses.

Pres. Samuel N. Stevens, pre-
sented with the plan this morn-
ing, said that the matter of fi-
nances would have to be arranged,
but it the library would be con-
scientiously used by the students,
some provision could he made,
Hayes Cements,

“I am in agreement with such
a plan provided that student use
merited its opening. I should like
to see such a plan given a trial,"
were the sentiments expressed by
Wendell Hayes, a member of the
library committee.

Young cited a specific case at
Northwestern university where
the library was opened Sunday
after recommendation had been
made by the student government
agencies on that campus.

Reason for Action.

It was the opinion of the Coun-
cil that such action would help
to solve the reserve book prob—
lem, where one student had a
reserve hook for the entire Week~
end and the rest of the class was
made to suffer.

Several of Lhe Council members
thought that there is a definite
attempt being made to raise
scholastic standards of the col-
lege, and that this action would
be a definite aid in reaching that
cud. -
