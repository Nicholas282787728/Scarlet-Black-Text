Grinnell Siuden’r Body to Back Team Today

To the Editor:

During the past football season an organization
has come into being in Grlnnell known as the
Grinnell Quarterbacks Club. Its object has been
to get behind and boost the college and higii school
football teams in any legitimate manner. An
average attendance of 60 business and profes-
sional men has been on hand at the Monday
meetings at which the games of the preceding
week have been talked over and analyzed.

The oriiincll Quarterbacks have taken a sincere
and active interest in Griiiiicli football, They won-
der sometimes if the interest which they feel is
being matched on tho campus,

They want the Crinnell college student body
to feel that good football teams don’t just grow;
they are made by hard work, co-operation. and
an interested and enthusiastic student body.

They would like the student body to feel with

them that although oriniicll is not a member oi
the Missouri valley conference any longer, the
Midwest coulei-euce, to which the college now he-
longs, plays tough i‘ootbnll. Every conlcieiice game
that Grilmell plays is it battlc. The competition
is right in drinnell's class. if there is any feel-
ing in the student body that G 'iiioll is perhaps
it step above its fellow membe s of the Midwest
conference, L'liat the winning of games should be,
taken as a mtfer of coursc and the losing of
games dismissed with a shrug, that feeling should
be eliminated. It docs not tend to make winning
iootball teams.

Today the Pioneers meet Colorado college in
the closing gamc of the season. The Quarterbacks
are pulling for them to give Bennie Douglas a
victory in this final clash. What is the student
