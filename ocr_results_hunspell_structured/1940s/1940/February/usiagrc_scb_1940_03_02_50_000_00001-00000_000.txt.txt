Presentation of Henrik lbsen’s ‘Gllosls’ Seen as Successful
For Memorable Acting of a Difﬁcult and Dated Production

Nash Leads

 

By Henry Alden.

Thursday night in the Alumni
Recitation hall auditorium the de.
partment ot drama, under the di-
rection of sara Sherman Pryor,
presented a fifty-year old dra-
matic classic, When it appeared
in 1881 “Ghosts” was not a pop-
ular play, but it made dramatic
history. The Grinnell production
is not likely either to prove a
popular ventureialthough for a
different reason; what the audi-
ence of Ibsen’s day found shock-
ng, we are likcly to find merely
dull. But the Grinnell perform»
ancc too is a memorable occa-
sion, for it demonstrates some of
the finest acting in the history
of the local stage.

“Ghosts" is in many ways an
old-fashioned play, and the set-
ting was remarkable in its reali-
zation of the Victorian era in
which the story is laid. Ibsen in
modern dress has always seemed
to me a lamentable incongruity,

W

,for if one is to app~ cicte the full
force of l'bsen's genius one must
remember the social background
of his generation, It is useless to
attempt to evade the tact that
Ibsen’s plays are dated, as all
problem plays are doomed to be.
Not even the switt tempo at
which the tirst act was played
can disguise the truth that it is
more debate than drama, and a
debate on an issue that is no
longer controversial is bound to
he tiresome.

But lbsen was a great draina-
tist as well as an earnest morale
ist, and “Ghosts” is a marvelof
compact drama and, compelling
showmanship. There is no last
act in all dramatic litcraturc
that has a greater emotional im-
pact thaii the last act of
“Ghosts." Hcre truly is a modern
example of thc Greeks’ catharsis;
it is of the Aeschylean order.

The play is more than a model
of technical skill and eloquent

,and Ruth Schulte played the nine-

'James Russell the wheedling hy‘p-

moralizing. Ibsen was a master of

characterization. Jacob Eng-
strand and Regina arc perhaps
types, but they are unforgettable;
teenth-century "gold-digger” and
ocrite for all the parts are worth.
Pastor Manders too is a type, al-
though morc fully drawn; and far
miliar as we are with Freud and
with the unhappy story of Miss
Sadie Thompson, we are apt to
find him rather obvious, and at
times, even ludicrous in a way
that the author never intended.
Yet Homer McDowell, as always,
spoke his lines beautifully and
made the Pastor a convincing hu-
man being, Oswald Alving is not
one of Ihsen‘s most successful
creations; he remains a somewhat
ridiculous youth, and Alfred Boye
len was visibly struggling against‘
this handicap during the firstl
