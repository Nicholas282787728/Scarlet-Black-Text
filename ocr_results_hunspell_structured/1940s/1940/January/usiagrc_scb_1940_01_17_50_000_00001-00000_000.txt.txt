Student Agrees with Recent ‘Arc You Gulliblc?’ Editorial

Denouncing Effects of Foreign onpagan

da on U. 5. Public

 

I would like to sayafew thousand
words in answer to your letter in
the Open Forum column of the
January 13 issue of the Scarlet
and Black. However, I shall limit
my vocal tirade to a few hune
dred.

I do not think that the author
of the editorial “Are You Gulli-
hie?" presents a particularly
biased attack against allied prop-
aganda, Rather, I should say, he
points out a few of the outstand-
ing examples of the present of-
forts of European nations to force
some fiction into the minds of a
gullible American people. Yes,
Barnum was righ, they're gullie
ble. The quotation which the nu-
thor uses from the Writer’s Digest
should satisfy your mind on that
question.

The effects of allied propa-
ganda during the War from 1914
to 1918 are well known. At least,

diey were before the rise of the
present European dictator-ships. I
think the American people were
very gullible then; and with the
proper effort on the part of Euro-
pean propagandists, they will be
so again.

I shall quote a few paragraphs
from the writings of Oswald
Spengler concerning the position
of newspapers during times of
war. They are bold statements.
Perhaps he is biased, possibly
wrong, but they do stimulate
some thought.

“Gunpowder and printingbelong
together . . . . Now the press-
cnmpaig-ii appears as the prolong-
atlonior the preparationeof war
by other means, and in the course
of the nineteenth century the
strategy of outpost fights, feints,
surprises, assaults, is developed
to such a degree that a war may
be lost ere the first shot is fired

Pioneers Will Face Drake

Five In Des Moines Friday

‘4 Team Weakened
EXPLAINS GUIDANCE CLINIC l

If Peisner S+ays
Ou’r of Line-Up

By Jack Wile.

Gl'illllell‘s basketball team,
leading‘ the Midwest confer-
ence With four wins and no
losses, will meet the Drake
Bulldogs in a non—conference
game at Des Moines this Fri-
day night.

Swan, O‘Conner star.

Drake's quintet, led by lanky
Ned Swan, promises to be one of
the toughest opponents facing
Grinnell this season. The Bull-
dogs, who tied with Oklahoma A,
& M. for first place in the Miss-
ouri Valley conference last year,
are now in third place. Another
major threat to the Pioneers in
Friday night's game will be
Walter O'Conner, who chalked up
149 points last year to take sec-
ond place in the scoring for
Drake,

Peisner Ill.

The Pioneers’ regular center,
Gene Piesner, who has been ill
‘dunng the past week, will pro-
bably see little action in the game.
As a result, the probably start-
ing lineup places Nash and Ken-
dall at forward, Hamann at cen-
ter, and Fort and Zahller in the
guard positions.

Grinnell dropped two games to
the Bulldogs last year, 27425 and
32»64. If the Pioneers turn in
a game of the same calibre as
their contest with Detroit Un'-
versity on January 3, this year's
story may be different.

Group Called for
7:30 p.m.Thursday
In Clark Clubroom

ser, Marshalltown airport opera-
tor, has consented to attend the

plain his plan of constructing an

bership to 'Skyways' is still open

in order to increase the chances
for getting the program here.”
