Fund Campaign
For Half Million
Goal ls Slar‘l'ed

A campaign to raise $500,000. iii-
cluding $200,000 for a new "re-
creational center" or field house
of some kind, and $300,000 for
endowment, was launched at the
meeting of the Grinnell college
board of trustees, December 15.
The decision to start a drive
for funds for the "recreational
center" was undoubtedly spurred
by the destruction of the women's
gymnasium by fire, Novemher 24.
A committee composed of
Stewart R. Kirkpatrick, Omaha:
and Gerard s. Nollcn and Fred A,
Little, Des Moines, was .named
to organize the drive work. The
group plans to meet later this
month to study ways and means
to further the campaign. ’

crinnell where he became dean
of the faculty and head. of the
department of romance languages

During his four years at Grin-
nell, Lookahaugh's grid teams
had a record of 10 victories, 22
defeats, and two ties. However,
nine of the defeats were suffered
at the hands of Missouri Valley
