GRl'NNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1940

 

Between
The Goal Posts

Due to faculty red tape, G, L
ter Duke, director of athletics is
unable to release the 1941 foot-
hali schedule. However, we note in
our exchanges that Grinneil is
scheduled to meet Drake Oct. 3
at Des Moines, and that Beloit
will travel here to meet the Pie-
nears NOV. 1. . . .

At the luidnest conference meet
ing, the Gruuiell delegation was
the only group supporting the re-
quest of Carleton to allow the
Nertnfield eleven to participate in
four instead of six conference
footbau games next year. . . .

Incidentally, Carleton has been on
the brink of dropping out of the
conference for some time, claim-
ing they are at a geographical
disadvantage The choices up
to Carleton are threefold, The
Car-ls can continue with full con-
ference standing; engage in part
time competition without being
considered for championships; or
they may withdraw from the con-
ferenee.

Speaking of Minnesota schools,
st. Olaf, another Northfield school,
had a member of their football
squad selected for the Associated
Press and United Press all-Min-
nesota football squad . . . it so
happened that the player had been
injured in pre-season practice,
‘and had not seen a minute action
all year. . . .

The new type backboard which
is to be installed over in the
gymnasium is a fad in the Mid~
west conference, being already in
use at Beloit, Carleton, and Ripon,
while Monmouth and Lawrence,
along with Grinnell will have
them this year. . . Washburn has
only been held scoreless once
since 1937. . . .

Gales Hall
Holds Lead

Dibble Loses Fi‘II'll
Siraigln‘ Volleyball
Game This Season

Gates hall maintained its un-
blemished record. and Langan
scored its first victory of the sea~
son in the men's intramural
volleyball games Wednesday night.

Lang-airs victory, their first in
five matches this year, came at
the expense of Dibble, 15-9, 15-11.
it was Dibble‘s fifth successive
loss this season.

Against Clark. Gates met its
stitfest opposition so far this sea~
son. Although Clark was the first
team to take a game from Oates,
they lost by scores of 15-9, 5-15,
15-11.

Baskel‘ball--

Continued from page 1

the remainder of the ‘scl'ap, the
Pioneer eagers stayed out in
front, boosting the gap to the
final 36-25 win.

Throughout the game, the Pit)-
neer passing was ragged, and they
were ineffective in close tries.
The rifle eye of Peisner, along
with McCartney, proved the win-
ning margin; their hits from the
middle of the floor accounted for
most of the Grinnell scoring.

The Pioneers will meet Knox
tonight at Galesburg, 111.. for their
second game of the season. The
lineup will include last night’s
starters, according to information
from Ben Douglas, the Pioneer
cage coach.

The tentative lineup will be:
Jerry Fort (f): Paul Patterson
if); Gene Peisner (c); Stanley
zahller (g); and Harold Kendall
(g). McCartney, Adkins, Dewitt,
Youngstrom, and Bowers will
probably see action in the game.
