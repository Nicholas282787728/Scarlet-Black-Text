0 WE PLEAD FOB SANITY

When the current European war burst upon
an expectant world last September, sentL
mellt in the United States was overwhelm—
ingly opposed to our entrance into the Old
World‘s conflagration.

And perhaps nowhere was that opinion
more pronounced than here upon Grinnell
campus. Little danger for the allied cause
was then forseen, for what could the aims
of an economically insecure and socially un—
stable Germany accomplish against the
might of the French and English empires?

But all that has changed. With dead-
ly precision, Hitler has added Poland, Den-
mark, Norway, Belgium, Holland, alld Lux-
embourg to his already impressive list of
conquests. And now his troops are ham,
mering the French army upon the road to
Paris. Similarly, sentiment ill the United
States has undergone all increasing change.
Whereas last fall we were unalterably op»
posed to ”saving the world for democracy”
we are now becoming more and more cone
vinced that it is our holy duty to “save the
world for civilization.”

But far more important than this grow-
ing conviction that the day of the Crusades
has dawned anew is the rapidly increasing

defeatism that threatens to ,capture the
public mind. Nor is Grinnell college an
exception to this mob reaction. Over and
over during these past few days we have
heard the sentiment, “Well, boys, it won‘t
be long now until we’ll be trading our fed-
oras for steel helmets." And again and
again, these words: ”Doesn't look like we’ll
be back here next year, does it, fellows?"

It is not that those who speak thus are
particularly eager to absorb a dose of Ger—
man leadl Rather, they merely figure that
someone must call a halt to the ollrush of
this “powel'cmad maniac" and that, inas-
much as the British and French seem un»
able to accomplish that end, it is our obli-
gation to “humanity” to strike where the
allies have failed. And for that altruistic
motive there are those who are gradually
becoming willing to follow their fathers‘
footsteps to France.

Now, we recognize that their, attitudes
upon that subject are their own business,
for, after all, it’s their neck.

But before that conviction grows any
stronger, before more than a few become
ready ,to gain immortal glory on the bat-
tlefields of Europe, let us say just a few
words upon the matter. We are thorouglr
ly aware that for those whose minds are
already hardened into a passionate hatred
for one side or the other, our remarks will
have no meaning, But to those who have
not yet reached that unfortunate state of
mind we make this threefold plea:

-G

First, in the name of truth, let us ex-
clude emotionalism and war-mongering from
our thinking upon this subject. The mat—
ter is far too vital to permit ourselves to
be horn—swoggled by pictures of “bombed
women alld children" and high-sounding
talk of “the peril of democracy.” At all
costs, for our personal welfare and for
the welfare of our country, we must keep
our minds detached, impersonal and im»
pervious to swelling emotions,

Second, let us remember that war has not
become any less similar to hell since Sheri»
dau made his famous statement.

And let us recall, also, that we weren‘t
too successful ill saving “democracy” twen-
ty years ago. How much more successful
would we be now in saving ”civilization?”

We write these words with hesitation,
knowing how inadequate they will be in
quelling the defeatist, emotion-inspired at-
titude that Europe needs#and will obtain
four aid. No doubt that opinion will
grow. We can not stop it, But, at least,
we need not support it. And we can Speak
a word for sanity.

That is what we have done

Around Chinese pagoda;
