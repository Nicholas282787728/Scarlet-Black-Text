THE SELF-CONSCIOUS AUDIENCE

It is not often that a play so completely
somber ill tone as ”Ghosts" is presented to
a Grinnell audience. This is partly because
of the greater demands made upon the act—
ors in such a play; but since the perfol—
malice of last weekend we wonder whether
it is not even more because the Grinnell
audience is not worthy of i

Just as it is necessary to learn to look
at a painting or to listen to a symphony, it
is necessary to learn to watch a play. Perv
haps it is continual moviegoing which has
led us to believe that there are no rules
connected with being a member of an dud-
ience. The pointed remarks and sly laugh—
ter so often indulged in by movie audiences
are in bad enough taste, but at a stage per-
formance they are Unforgivable. Here the
audience owes it to the players to give its
complete respectful attention to the play;
and it is quite unnecessaly to acknowledge-
the tension it produces by anything but sils
ence.

A cast as competent as the one we saw
last weekend is undoubtedly able to conquer
this added hindrance to its effectiveness. In
the end such rude behavior is only a reflec—
tion upon the audience. To snicker at the
mention of illegitimacy is to admit that we
are too immature and too self-conscious to
accept the “facts of life" Without blushing.
Are we indeed? Then the drama depart-
ment had better stick to comedy.

Opening Set

Fresco Painting
To Be Explained
By Sternfeld ‘Panel

“Painting in Fresco," an unusual
type of art exhibit, is scheduled
to open on Thursday evening,
March 7, at the quadrangle, Edith
sternfeld. assistant professor of
art, announced Tuesday.

The display will demonstrate
the various processes involved in
fresco painting, and is built
around an experimental panel,
“The Circus," painted last snm~
inch by Miss sterufeld under the
direction of the mural painter,
Jean Chariot, when he was guest
instructor at the state University
of Iowa.

in fresco painting no adhesive
substance of any kind is en]-
ployed, Miss sternfeld explained,
the colors being bound to the
wall by the chemical reaction
taking place between the pigs
ments, the air, and the lime in
the wet plaster. Samples of the
dry pigments are shown in the
exhibit and an additional demon.

OPEN FORUM

To The Editor: .

Another student recently tried
to point out the effect on school
spirit which would result from
setting a maximum of two Victor-y
Days per year or a minimum, I
was reminded of the days when
I used to dry dishes for my moth-
er at home. I would like to draw
a parallel between di- ng the dish.
es at home and cooperating with
and working for the athletic teams
at Grinncll.

First, suppose that my mother
said, “John, if you dry the disli-
cs for me I will give you a
nickel for the first two times,
a total of a dime, for the first
two times; but for all times

i

 

ingxl The first two times I
would dry the dishes willingly;
the third time, unless I loved
my mother very much, I would
rcfuse to dry the dishes, be-
cause there would be no reward.
1n the same way there would be
a drop}; g of athletic spirit if,
the two victory days were used
up early in the year, Would
the students back the basket-
ball tenrn with the same enthus-
iasm as they did the football
team if there was not to be the
same reward?

Again, if my mother said, “John,
there will be dirty dishes today.
Now I may not get around to
washing them; at any rate I do
not think that they will be Washed
more than twice, But rll give you
two nickels, a total of a dime,
whether you dry them or not,"
When my mother called me to diy
the dishes, if she washed them, I
would refuse, unless I loved her-
very much, for it would be much
easier to take thedime for doing
nothing than for drying the dish—
es even once. In the same man»
her, if the students are guarante-
ed two days a year free from
school, when they are called to
work for the team and cheer it
on, unless they are very fond
of their school spirit, which they
have not been lately, they will sit
back and take the two days rather
than work to earn them.

But now my mother says,
“John. 1 do not know how many
times there uill be dishes to
dry, nor how many at a time.
If you will dry the sinirll butch-

} es, then every time there is a.

big butch I will give you it
niekcl. If there are no big
batches, you uill get nothing;
if there are three or four you
will get a nickel for cycry one.
it is up to you." Then, when-
over there arc dishes- to dry,
small batch or- big, John will
come a-iniining uitlr the towel
in his hand, And so the stu-
dents will come nrrulmillg to
bar-k the teams in small games
or big if the big \" tones are
rewarded by victor. days, no
mntter how many of them there
are or how few.

if you are willing to take your
chances on there being more big
batchcs than two or fewer, then
tell your neighbor. 1 for one will
take my chances with Ben Doug—
las and the new deal in athletics
that Grinnell will have next year.

Romania’s King
‘Carol the Cad’
Is Real Leader

—By William 0. Harris.

Hottest spot on the European
diplomatic front is beggar-ridden
Romania. And jumpiest diplo~
matic jitter-bug is its luxury-lov-
ing King Carol.

Between Germany's forceful
requests for Romanian oil and
Britain‘s equally strong calm»
tor—demands for a Romanian
refusal, Carol lives in the per-
pctunl shadow of the interna-
tional eightdlall.

But so far, His Majesty has
been doing all right for himself
and country. Long famed as
Europe’s biggest bounder, carol
has increasingly given the lie to
that characterization since his ac-
cession to the Romanian throne
in 1930.

Formerly, headlined by the
London Daily Express as “King
Carol the Cad," he habitually
found England's royal family
“out to lunch” whenever he
called, Most famous story of
English disapproval of Carol
occurred at the funeral of
George v:

Noting a mysterious man in
white following Carol in the fu-
neral parade, the stiff-necked
British press promptly identified
the white-clad individual as the
”masseuf" of the Hotel Ritz, and
claimed that Carol, having been
out on a hinge the preceding eve,
took him along in case of emer»
gency. (Later, the mysterymarch-
er was identified as a Rumanian
war heroibut the story has its
points.)

Canned in 1925 by his austere
Prussian pupa for his too-close
acquaintance with flame-topped
Magda Lupescu, Carol spent the
next five years in royal hell-
raising all over the world, tak-
ing time out in 1928 to junk
his parent-inspired match with
Princess Helen, alter a wedded
liie of quarrels over- otheruonr
en.

Meantime, his morals»bmlnd
father died, and Queen Marie,
Carol's mother zmcl once-famous
royal beauty, took over the reins.

But by 1930, the Rumaniiuls
were crying for rclief from the
corruption and miscgovermnent
of Mario's ill-chosen ministels,
Convinced that any change
would be on improvement, the
lturnaninn parliament voted 310
to 1 to recall Carol, refusing to
recognize that lie haul ever for-
feited the succession,

Since that time, Carol has done
a habitrchanging ﬂiprflop and
has given Rumania a strong and
relatively graft—free government.
Taking as his motto, “Divide and
rule,” he has freed the country
from internal unrest and peace—
disturbing organizations.

At his accession. the Nazi-
inspired Iron Guard constituted
the greatest threat to domestic
cal-n. Filindlced and directed
from Germany, this group
called for it close hook-up with
Hitler and an illtcnsiiied Jew
extermination. But Carol met
this problem by permitting 45
days of iron Guard pogroms
until the liorriiicd citizenry
culled for n nah.

car-oi then promptly set him-
self up as royal dictator, liquir
dated the Iron Guard, and em-
barked on a mailrfisted one-man
rule. But today, he faces a far
greater problem: How to remain
in the social registers of both
Hitler and Chamberlain. So far,
by signing with everybody and
making ’em guess, he has been

 

successful in keeping the Nazis on
their side of the frontier and
Downing street in its London fog.

And anybody who has done
that is something more than an
unprincipled royal cad—as even
the British press will no doubt
admit by now
