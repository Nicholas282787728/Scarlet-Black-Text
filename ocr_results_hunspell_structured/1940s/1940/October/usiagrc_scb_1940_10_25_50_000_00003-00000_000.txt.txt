Insulting Faculty
Was Everyday
Thing in 1865

If instructors at Grinnell today
are inclined to think that fresh-
men are at times a bit rough at
the edges, they shouldhave taught
back in "the good old days" of
Iowa college.

In 1865, when George F. Ma-
goun was inaugurated as the first
president of Iowa college, the
Rev. Alden B. Robbins, president
of the trustees, touched upon a
moot point in his charge to the
president. .

In warning President Magoun
of the “difficult and delicate pee
sition" he was to hold, and of
the hardships attendant on the
office, Robbins said, .. . . , there
are students of even the sopho—
more class . , . . who in some
cases do not know enough until
they are seniors (witness) even
to avoid personal insults to their
teachers."

institutions: Iowa college, estab~
lished in 1846, and "Grinnell uni-
versity," founded in 1856 at Grins

first president of this institution.

This union of the two schools
occurred in 1858, and the insti-
tution so formed was called Iowa
collegc.

The first movement

was madc. by a “called
meeting of ministers and others”
held at Denmark, Iowa, March
12, 1844. This is according to a
“Histon'cal Sketch" publishcd in
1865, and written by President
Mago’un. Little was done at this

In 1854 and again in 1857 the
city of Davenport laid strccts
through the Iowa college property

ty was sold in 1859 to an Epis-
copal college and Iowa college
was again looking tor a place
to locate,

At this time the trustees of
“Grihnell university” offered the
property of this institution, in-
cluding a site of 20 acres, to

Magoun's inaugural Address.

President Magoun's discourse
that July morning 70 years ago,
dealt primarily with the school
system. He advocated a closc co-
operation betwcen upper and low»
er schools. “No adequate com-
mon school system without (:01-
leges, No colleges without ade—
quate common school Systems.”
That is the way to preserve de—
mocracy and equal opportunity,
Magoun thought.

When the Rev. George F. .Gates
was elected and inaugurated as
president of Iowa college in 1587,
co»education was the major issue
of the day. Though it had exist—
ed on the campus since the
beginning, co-cducation had never
been formally accepted by the
trustees

his address, took up the same
subject and praised the women for
their Christian work. He asserted
that he felt that the advantages
of co—education over-balanced the
defects which it might have.
Moreover, he believed in ’Women's
rights, . . at least to the axe
tent of her having all she could
get." He went on .to say that
women had won their rights in
opposition to the college, and he
thought they could be-liept in
the same way.

cerning corediication. Dr. Gates
took up the theme of his address
and discussed a "Liberal Educa-
tion." He named mental and
physical discipline as the primary
results of this type of educae
tioual institution.

Bradley Named.

In 1901, after Dr. Gates resig-
nation, Dan Frecman Bradley be—
came the head of Iowa college.
The outstanding qualities of Dan
Bradley, according to those who
knew him, was his democratic,
friendly manner in a day when
aloofncss and formality were more
common to educators. Bradley
had a special interest in trees
and was known to Lake a spade

, as Iowa college)

and plant them with his own
hands. Five majestic oak trees on
thc middle campus at Gi-innell
are memorials to Dan Bradley’s
love of trees. These are the

Bradley oaks.

Bradley was at Iowa college
three years, when he resigned to
resume his ministerial activities
at Pilgrim Congregational church
in Cleveland. He died a few years
ago.

Dan Bradley, the humanist,
was followed at Iowa college by
John Thumas Main, who was in-
augurated in 1906. This position
was held by Main until the day
of his death in 1931, At his in-
auguration, Dr. Main spoke of
"The Collegeilts Ideals and Its
Problem." The ideals of the
founders of Grinnell (still known
he gives as:
genuineness; fearlessness; regard
for human needs; and the com-
prehending ideal.

Dr. Main also dealt with the
problem of expanding courses. It
was at that time mat the prob»
lem of introducing science ipto
liberal colleges had arisen. The
president felt that a liberal Cole
lege shoud base its policy on a
study of the classics. Main, birth
self, was a Platonist, and his
conviction was that a liberal
course should include a heavy
that of Greek and Latin.

Nollen Fifth President.

Following Main’s death in 1931,
John Scholte Nollen was inducted
into office as the fifth Grinnell
College president. Al. his inaugural
ceremonies Feb. 11, 1932, Dr.
Nollen explained the "Function of
the College," as he interpreted it.
“We specialize in liberal edu-
cation,” he quoted at one time
to illustrate What he thought a
liberal college should do.

"Two types of knowledge are
necessary,” he conhnued, "to
meet modern business conditions,
and it is the function of the col-
lege to furnish one type or the
other.” The university can give
specialized knuwledge, the liberal
college gives a cultural
base.
