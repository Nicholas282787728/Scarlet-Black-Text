0 AN OPEN LETTER

To the Officers of the Men‘s Halls:

You know, gentlemen, the other day we
discovered that rumor has it that student
government on this campus is little but an
administl'ation—dominated illusion of course,
the rumor was extremely vague and uncon-
vincing, but even at that it startled us
into a little speculation.

At 1‘ ‘st, we were inclined to view this
accusation as merely a bit of grape-vine
gossip. But later we became rather un-
willingly convinced that there might be just
a slight amount of truth in this monstrous
accusation.

And then we began to wonder why
such a situation existed. After all, there
is a reason for everything, and certainly
there must be some cause for this exertion
of administrative influence in such 3. seem
ingly faultless set-up for student governs
lnent. Now inasmuch as we are not num-
bered among that greatly respected group
him
with complete certainty upon this matter.
But we do sometimes wonder if this ex-
ercise of authority-froln-above might not be

n as student leaders, we can’t speak,

the result of the failure to exercise auth-
Drity-fromsbelow.

We can’t help but feel that perhaps
the fact that as many as a dozen window
panes can be broken in an evening Without
any evident action from the men’s own gov—
cruing bodies might help explain why other
powers step in.

Or perhaps the fact that there has been
no sustained attempt by the men‘s officers
t reduce the mortality rate of corridor light
fixtures may have something to do with the
question. Or the fact that quiet hours have
become little more than an empty mockery.
Or the unpuni'shed abuse of the club room
furnishings in certain of the halls

Incidentally, it has been a long-estab-
lished principle ill the field of government
that whenever the existing adlninistr tion
fails to maintain reasonable order. a strong-
er power has the rig-ht to intervene to re-

orc that orde‘ Perhaps recalling that
principle would aid in explaining the rumor
that Grinnell student government is ad-
ministrationeinfluenced.

We trust you will excuse our mentioning
such a thing as good government to you,
gentlemen, but we thought that, just pos-
sibly, you might be interested in the sub—
ject—and in retaining what governing
pl'vileges the students now have.

Disuse often kills things, you know.

ﬁG
>0 VESPER QHOIR

It is seldom that newspapers permit ads
vertising to creep into their editorial col—
umns, but we feel that it is justifiable for
special occasions. Such all occasion is af—
forded by the pel'i'orl once of Haydn’s
“Creation” to be given tomorrow afternoon
by the Vesper choir. From its beginning,
the Vesper choir has enjoyed a well-merited
reputation for a high standard of excellence.
New evidences of this are constantly coming
to light. For example, the'incidentnl trib-
ute which Rabbi Mannheimer paid to it last
Sunday; and the fact that the Choir’s rce
col-dings of Handel’s “Messiah" and
Gollnod‘s “St. Cecilia Mass” have met with
a large sale both ill the Middle West and in
the East,

Of course such a reputation is not achi-
eved without long hours of patient rehears—
ing on the part of the members of the
Choir, aild without direction of the highest
caliber. In the face of the facts, it would
be unfortunate if a large part of the student
body leaves college without realizing what a
privilege they have missed by not attending
Vespers regularly

The entire Vesper hour tomorrow will be
given over to the Choir performance. We
urge you to attend.

confused reasoning, the result of
which has inspired seversl (pies

whether or not Mr. G.‘s confessed
“oak" or unit, rind coopenrtiou
has i: really 1 ed beyond the
uco n stage as mnnilcstcd by the
last meeting, but will proceed
uitli these questions.

1. Why does he construe my
criticism to have been on accusa-
tion of the “woi‘thlcsslless” ol
his organization.

the end of the election year?

3. How large is a “full sized”
chapter or the c. K. A.?

4. Speciﬁcally, what are
“certain fundamental Republican
doctrines" which he speaks of?
(It is imperative that this queer
tion be answered as Mr. G.stated
that, “We, as a group . . . agree"
with them.)

5. Why is the possibility of a
platform arising against the nu-
tional or international interest or
“little matter," and why does it
evolve into personal and polltical
prcludice 7

5. Why was not democratic
parliamentary procedure used at
the meeting in which Mr. G."
chapter of the c. R. A. cloctc
officers.

1 nm quite sure that lnitil these
questions are nnsucred accurate-
1}, ndcqunlely und sitisrucmrlly,
intelligent and open-lilinded col-
lege students should think first
bciorc signing membership cards
into the c. n. A. _

If those questions are not an»
slvei-cd as ahove described. or if
answers ai'e,\not at least attempt-
cd, it will appear that the c, R.
A. chapter is beyond the help of
constructive criticism and merits
little sympathetic attention on
the campus.
