Will Slacks Follow Gay ’90 Bustle
Into the Pit of Oblivion? Time’ll Tell

Slacks are going the way of the
bustle, if vague, indefinite rumors
floating up to the Scarlet and
Black office can be taken as true.

The gist of these rumors state
that slacks will he frowned upon
by the League Board, quadrangle
hostesses, and Dean Gardner if
worn on any day except Satur-
day. Slacks are strictly nihil in
the classroom, and will be
frowned upon in the quadrangle
dining-room, if our quadrangle
reporter is to be believed.

One coed, a James girl we be-
lieve, reports that James will not
accept the dictatorial decree and
that any pair at slacks adorning
feminine hips on weekdays will
undoubtedly belong to one of the
"rebels,”

Immediate reaction to the coup
for morality as regards the local
merchant has not been learned.
However, it may be that Grinnell
is the locale for a new move-
ment for women’s fashions. Time
will tell.

Republican Club
Holds Meeting
Tuesday Night

Fourteen members and prospec-
tive members of the Young Re-
publican organization met last
night in the Clark hall clubr-oom.

Ray Custafsou, one of the ex-
ecutive committee, presided over
the meeting. He discussed the
purpose and plans of the organi-
zation, saying, “It is organized to
interest students in politics and
to keep Republicans in the party."

A mock convention will be
held in the middle of May. The
discussion of the plans for this
convention, the adoption of the
constitution and the election of
officers will take place at the

next meeting on Wednesday,
April 24.

Derby Plans
Still Held

Incomplete

Faculty Social Group
Vetoes Plan to Hold
Dance on Friday

Plans for the annual Brown
Derby Drag, annual dance
Sponsored by Sigma Delta
Chi, men’s honorary journal'—
istic fraternity, are still in-
complete, it was announced
today by Ken Mathews, presi.
dent of the organization.

The group will meet in the lit
the dining room of the men’s dor-
mitories this evening to vote on
whether or not the dance will be
held this year. If it is held, it
will take place Saturday evening,
May 11, Mathews said.

Contrary to rumors floating
about the campus, Ben Pollack
and his orchestra will not play.
and the dance will not be held on
Friday evening, May 10, he
stated.

Sigma Delta Chi had planned to
sign Pollack, who is now playing
at the Panther Room of the Ho-
tel Sherman, for the Friday date.
However, the faculty social com-
mittee refused to grant pennie-
sion to hold the affair on Friday
evening.

Pollack could have been signed
for Saturday evening, but, ac-
cording to Mathews, SigmaDelta
Chi felt it wouldbe unfair to have
the student body pay tor an or-
chestra like Pollack for a three
hour dance.

The reasons for the social com-
mittee's actions are said to be
two-fold. The primary reason is
that a track meet has been
scheduled for Saturday, May 11,
and it is the belief of G. Lester
Duke, track coach, that the dance
would be a detriment to the
team's sleep on Friday night. The
other reason is that a band con-
cert is scheduled for Friday eve-
ning.
