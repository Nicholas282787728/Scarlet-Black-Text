“Grinnell is a wonderful word
to the thousands of people now
here and to those scattered
throughout the country who
were once Grinnell students.
But in China ‘PO—Wen’ is an<
other word which means just
as much — maybe more 7 for
‘PD-Wen‘ is the Chinese Word
for Grinnell-in-China."

With this introduction Miss
Alice Reed, speaking in Chapel
Thursday, began the story of
her 32 years in China as a
Congregational missionary teach—
er.

Miss Reed was among that
small band of teachers Who set
out from Grinnell in the fall of
1916. They spent a year in Be-
king studying Chinesef Then
with‘ funds donated by the cit-
izens of Grinnell they took over
an old school. building, made
improvements, built new build~
ings, and Grinnellcin»China was
born. At first there were two
of these secondary" schools, one
for boys and one for girls, Miss
Reed became principal of the
girls’ school. In 1929 these two
schools were merged.

Several graduates of Grinnell<
insChina have done college work
here at Grim-tell and at other
colleges and universities in the
United States. Some returned to
become teachers at Grinnell-in-
China, Others have become doc-
tors and ministers. “All our
graduates," says Miss Reed,
“have become leaders in their
communities."

Students at Grinnellrin-China
have been both Christian and
non—Christian. And courses in
religion have been optional.
“All the students, however, have
been touched by the religious in~
ﬂuence at Grimell-in-Chi‘na,"
Miss Reed stated.

Miss Reed returned to China ‘
in 1943 after having been
forced to leave by the Japan‘-
cse Conquest of 1941. She was
again forced to leave in 1946
when the Chinese Communists
took over the entire area and
GrinnclleineChina ceased to
exist as an institution.

After spending some time

With the recent Communist
conquest in China, the position
of the American Missionary has
become extremely clifﬁcult. Miss
Reed realizes that it is still
questionable as to whether she
will be able to return to China
in the fall to carry on the work
which has meant so much to so
many people.
