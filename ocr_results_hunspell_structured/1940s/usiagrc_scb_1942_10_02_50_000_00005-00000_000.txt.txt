McKeoil New
Council Hood

Sial‘es Policy
For War-Time
Adminisl'l‘ai'ion

William McKeon. Read, who
emerged victorious over Orin
Wallick, also of Read, by a man
gin of 22 votes in the final bal-
loting of the student council pres-
idential election of September 25,
today advised the Scarlet and
Black as to his executive policy.

“This year. I think the student
council can best serve by sacri-
ficing anything in the way of pos-
itive personal achievement in new
fields of endeavor," MoKeon said.

“The council should now devote
its entire efforts to the promotion
of complete cooperation among
the various governing groups on
campus.

“In this way, we can best for
cilitate the handlingofthe count-
less emergeny situations which
are bound to present themselves
continually to a college operating
on a war—time program such as
Grinnell is doing."

McKeon, although not a final-
ist in the student council election
of last March. was a strong can.
didate during the early stages of
the nominating convention ao-
companying that campaign.

John Miller, Dibble. who won
the third place on the prelimine
ary ballot, signified. before final
balloting began, that he did not
wish to be considered a candi-
date.

Sem-Fee Even+s
Available To Army

The semester fee, merely a white
card hearing R very unflattering
photo of its owner, is on import
ant instrument, indispensable to
the cultural and social life of a
Grinnell student.

The comparatively low price, ins
cluded in the year's tuition,
admits students to all inter-col
legiate sports activities, and to
plays, concerts, and lectures
sponsored by the college Concert
and Lecture series.

Army piesonnel of Grinnell will
be admitted to these same pro-
grams by arrangements not yet
definite. A charge will be made
proportionate to that of the stu

the length of time that officers
and soldiers may take advantage
