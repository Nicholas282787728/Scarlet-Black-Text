Alumni" Recitation hall audio
tol-lum. The curtain is sched-
uled to rise at 8:15 p. in,

The show is an English comedy
by‘Gerald Savory, one of the fore-
most of modern English play-
wrights. The story of the play is
concerned with an eccentric, but
thoroughly interesting Blitish
family, according to Becker.

this fall, received his masters de~
gree at Iowa University, where he
was acquainted with Clifton
Lamb, negro playwright who
graduated from Grinnnell several
years ago.

man Pryor, head of the drama as»
partment.

the daughter of the English
family, appeared in "Our Town,"
staged last yeilr.

Simons Sees No Chance of Improving
World Affairs by Return to League

Economics and collective security

were the subjects of Dr, Hans
Simons' fourth lecture In Herrick
chapel Thursday night. He dis-
cussed two phases: the difficulties
cxisung because of the mistakes
made in the past 20 years, and
the improvements likely.

“If we don't see why we fall,
we won't do better in the future,"
he said. "There is no hope to im-
prove international relations by
going back to the League of Na-
tionS The only hope is to go
aheu '

According to Dr. simohs, the
basic mistake of 1919 was the
misunderstanding of the relation
between politics and economics.
“Power is indivisible, and has to
bc economic and military at the

same time."

He stated, “Fear of war is the
basis for the outbreak of war,"
and explained his statement by
showing that countries became in-
volved in World War 1 as war
fear increased.

A lesson leamed from the last
war was that of rearnlament, Dr.
Simons added. “In fact, it has
been a solution to the problem of
unemployment. The balance of
power states is also the balance
of economic nationalism." He coir

~cluded, “Unity grows out of press -

sure from the outside.”

The fifth of the series of eight
lectures by Dr. Simons will be
given Tuesday at 7:30 p. m. in

Herrick chapel.
