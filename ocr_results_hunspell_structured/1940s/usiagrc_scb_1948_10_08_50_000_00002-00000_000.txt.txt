POLITICS, VOTING, AND ARTICULATION

There was a time way back when Grinnell college en—
joyed a political leadership in the state of Iowa. Somehow
gthrough sheer circumstance, or more probably sheer in-
dolence—we have lost that position.

Is it too much too expect from a college student that:
he should maintain a lively interest in current events?
Are we too immature, in the aggregate, to do some thin 7
ing about politics, particularly when the election of natio -
a1 leaders has an international aspect? Would not an _in-
telligent, articulate interest be a long step toward proving
that, far from being sheltered from a harsh outer world,
a college student is making a definite bid for citizenship
in a country that needs more deep—thinking, internation—
ally-minded leadership than ever before?

O,ur attention has been called to a resumption of the
political debates so aptly started on campus last spring.
To those responsible we shout good, let’s have more of .

And to those who are eligible to exercise their con:
stitutional prerogativeﬁin short, eligible to vote—we
point out that elsewhere in this issue there is news of a
non-partisan movement to assist registration and absen-
tee voting. This movement cuts all basis for any excuses
we can give for not voting. Take advantage of it, so that
the weight of your opinion can count, too.

OPEN COMMENT ON “OPEN CITY”

As is the case iii most movies, some parts are just
right and others either overdone or underdone, depending
lupon the variables: direction, the actor, circumstances of
ethe sequence, and many other points too numerous to men-

In addition to this, the new

your superior abilities, greater in—

WHERE THE MONEY GOES l
Starving and poorly clad people all over the world cool
looking to the United States for aid. Every one of us
should want to help alleviate their suffering. But the

The answer is extremely simple It does not involve
laboriously packing and mailing boxes overseas. Neither
does it involve sending money to any particular, distant
