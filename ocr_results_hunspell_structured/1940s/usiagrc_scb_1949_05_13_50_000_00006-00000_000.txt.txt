Joann Pitcher, Mears senior,

come from a responsible student
group. (Noisy ones are fine;
but they weaken too easily).

Such an attempt would have
at least some advantage. (Just
think, Women, how the hearts

of your parents would be grati» g

ﬂed at the thought of their
daughters rising to demand their
share of responsibility in the
college). If the attempt were
successful, the advantage would
be apparent Baffle board
members could quit being bate
ﬂed by prodiguous quantities of
sen sen or garlic laden breath.
Arid above all, Jelinek’s
“umpty-nine thousand trustees,
alumni, and ‘friends’ of the Cole
lege” would no longer have to
gargle with Airwick before vis-
iting the campus.

1: the college will not permit
the women to handle their drinks
ing problems, Without adminiss
trative dictation anywhere along
the line, I believe the generous
natures of Baffle and League
board women should compell
them to hand the college the
task of law entoroement. For—
tunately, we have a compar
tively young faculty; and I’m
sure nothing would appeal to
them half as much as the idea
of guard duty in Grinnell’s var»
ions taverns, or patrolling the
campus in the middle of the
night with a flashscamera and
notebook ready for instant ac-
tion,

At least, if a contest of this
nature must be perpetuated by
the school, l believe it should
be students against faculty and
administration rather than stu—
denl against student.

DEAR SIR: May 8, 1949

Last Saturday afternoon my
clothes in the gym were “re—
lieved” of a wallet containing
about $15, and a pair of sun
glasses.

This is not the first time I
have been robbed while attends

Who is to blame? In my opinv

by locking my door. But I findlaltitude that since robberies are

that not only does this college
not lui-nish locks tor its dermis
tory rooms, but that it strictly
prohibits students from safe-
guarding their property by in-
stalling locks at their own exs
pense. It is a college rule that
students’ rooms be left at the
mercy of any and every human
being capable of turning a door
knob.

The robbery I have sustained
rdid not happen in a dormitory,

but it well might have, and it
may next year when I move on

It seems to me that-the Col-

lege should either permit stu-
dents to lock up their property,
or, prohibiting this right. should
indemnify pupils for losses sus»
tained by theft.

What does the student coun—
cil think about this problem, if
anything? (But it probably
won’t think about it, if to do so
means bucking the administrav

tion)

I am not the only student at
Grinnell who would like the
right to be able to protect his
