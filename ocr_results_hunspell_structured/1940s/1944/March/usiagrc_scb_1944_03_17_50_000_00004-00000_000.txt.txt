seem to be following a policy of
cutting 111 behind the Japanese
losses, cutting the supply arteries
and leaving the ends of the tens
acles to die of slow starvation or-

ping up parties when the enemy
is thus weakened. This campaign
has indicated two factors that
should materially strengthen our
hand in the war with the Japan-
ese. The first. that the island

not be the slow agonizing and ex-
pensive process it was in the
Solomon group

The second, is the fact that

the Mar-shells, 111 the Mariannss,
at Marcus island, at Wake Island
and the smashing victory at Truk
(pronounced Track) we have sent
vulnerable aircraft carriers into
waters piotected by land based
aircraft.
