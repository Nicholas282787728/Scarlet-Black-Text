“We have heard much about

whose attitude is amendable to

groups will probably offer the
antlefascist leaders of the post

"For purposes of iinmcdiate exe
podicncy, the victorious Allies will
probably find themselves dealing
at first with the very army they
have been fighting. But in the
long view, thc now-passive anti-
Nazi groups can be used,"

Espy looks for the churches
and churchmen of Germany to
play an important part in the
post-war period, especially the
Protestant church, to which the
odium oi political party afllllarl
tion has not been attached, as in
has to the German catholic church
in thc Centrist party

“The record of Pastor Niemuller
and some 200 other ministers like
him, who have been interned in:
concentration camps, speaks (01";
the attitude of German church-
men. Despite many restrictions
thc German churches have conﬁne;
ued to exist in the presence of
Nazi disapproval, even when the
labor union, the liberal press and
the universities all bowed under
the yoke."

Pointing out that despite all
our conversations regarding post-
war Germany, it is the actual our
tho-spot victor who will have
most to say, and adding that in
the light of present military pro»
gress that victor is more likely to
bc Russia than either England or
the United states. Espy comment-
cd that one of the favorite
‘guesses‘ about German strategy
