Dr. Everton will leave for In»

tribution of food and medical sup
plics in the famine area, and the
supervision of rehabilitation ceri-
ters, where destitute people wili
be given occupational training and
an opportunity to develop new
means of self support. The pres

Famine Conditions

Famine conditions in India art
illustrated by a survey made irl
one small town in which 537 beg~l
gars were selected at random and{
intervieueti. Of these persons tWL,’
per cent were men, 53 per centi
women and 45 per cent children
Only four per cent of these were
professional beggars; the l'esti
were victims of the famine. Tlls‘
women and children normally wcrr
supported by husbands and fath-
ers. The present whereabouts oi
the men were unknown They
had been killed by the cyclone
had died of starvation or malaria
or had deserted their families.

The five basic reasons for thf
famine conditions now prevails
ing, Dr. Everton said, are: the
loss of Burma which cut off the
supply of rice. war conditions in
India causing inflation, the dis
location of transport and railway
systems due to military opera-
tions, making it difficult to bring
supplies from one part of the
country to another, the large
rains and the consequent loss at
rice, and the wide-spread hoard-
ing of rice — black markets.

ltiiasori

“n y dcc' ion to go to India was
based on a. sense of the very great
need that exists- therc, due to
famine conditions, and the desirc
to hem some dircct part in re-
lief se es," Dr. Ever-ton stated
“I believe that it is importanl
that we should share, where it is
possible, in the alleviation of ant
fering, and in meeting human
needs wherever they may he

Speech Office By May
l5; Open to Seniors

The annual Hill contest in speak
ing and singing will be held oi
Saturday, May 27, according to
Mrs. Velma Hiser, instructor in
spcech. This contest, open to
men and to senior uomen, offers

i prizes for the “most offal:-
t "speech" and “excellency in
Singing," following tlic wishes of
the brothers who established it

Dr, Gresham H. i-lili, Des
Moines, Iowa and Rev. James L
Hill, Salem, Mass, found these
pr es in 1391 to commemorate
the twentieth anniversary of their
gratduation from Grinnell cola
lege. The prizes were, as far as
is known, the filst of their kind
in the country. At first, only
men entered the contests. Later-
as women began to compete, the
number of contestants bccamc so
great and the judging so difficllli
that the Women's contest was
made separate, and the price mon»
ey was doubled by the Hills sci

l

visions.

This year, because of the small
enrollment, the contests again will
be combined. The prize money
formerly forty, twenty, and ten
dollars for first, second, and third
place, may also be somewhat re-

duccd.

The speaking in the contest is
extemporaneous. A. general top-
ic of which cach contestant has
a competent grasp, is selected.
Some special phase of this gen-
eral topic is handed the contest-
ant about five miniites before he
is called upon to speak. The
founders desired to establish “a
contest that would develop in col-
lege students the ab ‘ty to im‘luc
ence public opinion." This prin-
ciple is the guide for contestants
and judges. The audience judges
which speech is the most effec-
Live.

All entrants must apply at the
speech office by noon, May 15.
