Semester Fees Total $2,034

Ross Announces Groups' Allotments;
Music and Lecture Series Lead List .

Gerry Ross, student council president, announced this week
the apportionment of semester fees totaling $2,034 for the
first semester of the college year. The fee of $7.50, which
has been paid with nearly every student’s tuition, main-
tains thirteen entertainment and service organizations.

Leading the list with 5750 al-
lotted is the music and lecture
series, which will present concerts
by Ann Brown, soprano, Donald
Dickson, baritone, and others.
However, Miss Ross said that thc
percentage given to this com»
mittee is smaller than last year's
allowance and expressed the hope
that the amount would be in-
creased next semester.

The Scarlet to Block receives
$320; while the drama depart—
ment and the women's athletic
association tie for third place
with $225. The student council
receives $100, and another $100
goes to the chair, chorus, glee
club, and orchestra combined.

other allotments are as follows:
band, $96; student council's share
in the student auditor’s salary,
$51.67; student auditor‘s expense
account, 525.50; art exhibitions,
$42.50; and board of religion, 330.
A reserve fund of 567.48 will be
maintained either to provide ad-
ditional money for these college
organizations or to pay for all-
college social activities. The sums
available tor the war chest and
the recreation room have not been
announced.

Women Voters to
Discuss Conference

At Joint Meeting

Progress of the Dumbarton oaks
conference is the topic for dis-
cussion at the joint meeting of
the college League of Women
Voters with the town league Mon-
day evening in the quadrangle
drawing room.

Rosemary Fochek, Read senior,
will represent the college group
by explaining “The Dumbarton
oaks conference — what it is
not." The discussion will be led
by Mrs. Charles Payne.

This meeting will be the second
[or the college league concerning
the international security confer-
ence, which was described by vir-
ginia Foole, Read senior, at a
meeting Monday in Haines pars
lor. Miss Foote said that this
conierence of nations was designe
ed to exchange ideas regarding
the pledges of international orga-
nization made in the Connally
resolution and me Moscow decla-
ration.

Among the criticisms made of
the Dumbarton oaks plan as it
now stands, Miss Foote mentioned
that it has been called “peace by
dictatorship oi the big powers"
since it provides for the use of
national armies rather than an
international police force. She

called attention to China's pro-.

posal that a nation should not be
allowed to vote on a dispute in
which it was involved.

New Voucher Plan
Now In Operation

In order that school organizations
don't run up bills in excess of
their budgets, and that all bills
arc paid promptly, a new vouch—
er system is being set up this
year.

A pad of vouchers, the little
slips that authorize a person to
buy something and charge it to a
club, is now assigned to
treasurer. Each voucher contains
a number, the name or the buyer,
the purpose of the purchase, the
maximum amount to be spent,
the date, and the signature of the
treasurer. stubs with duplicate
information make it easier for the
treasurer to keep track of what
has been spent. The buyer must
return each voucher With a bill
from the dealer, for which the
treasurer writes a check. Treas

 

 

 

We Were Behooved - -

Dear reader, we have moved. True
to,the Scarlet and slack tradition
of onward and upward, we are
higher up, on the third floor of
ARH to be exact. We picked up
our ash trays, our typewriters,
our filing cabinet. and the big
horseshoe deck and walked.

We now have lots of room. In
tact, we look like the city room
of a big daily. From Lee in the
slot (technical term for the in~
side of the horseshoe) to the
lowly reporter on one oi the core
ner typewriters is a whoop and
a holler, loud ones. We have ve-
netian blinds and bright lights
and lovely neighbors . M.
Seckel is on one side, and Mr.
Prescott is on the other. It will
be so easy to run next door to
borrow a. headline or a map.
Wednesday a nice man from the
heating plant came over and in
stalled our telephone, so we are
nicely settled, thank you.

Sometimes, n moments of de-
mentia, we miss our cozy little
bungalow in the Ad building, with
its dark corners haunted by the
ghosm of cam and Brann. We
