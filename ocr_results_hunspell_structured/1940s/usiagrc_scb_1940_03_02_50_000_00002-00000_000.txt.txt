EQUALITY AND SPORTSMANSHIP

The Council of House Presidents, coope-
rating with the Intramural Board, recently
placed in circulation a new trophy to be
awarded to the hall showing the most
sportsmanship iii intramural competition.
Sportsmanship certainly deserves official
recognition and commendation This the
Miller Memorial Trophy has been instituted
to giv At best, howeve , the trophy serves
the purpose oi' rewarding sportsmanship
rather than directly developing it,

At present, intramural competition is
cal led on between six hallsior rather, be—
tween the residents and associates of six
halls. The two smallest halls have under
1’ ty residents and associates. The two
largest halls liaVe seventy residents and
associates. In other words these two small—
e' halls compete with the larger halls at :1
till ty-five percent disadvantage.

With the margin between defeat and Vicr
tory in intramui‘ni competition as small as it
is, a thirty—five percent advantage or dis-
advantage maltes a great difference. Last
year, for example, the two largest halls in
the dorms both finished in the higher half
in intramural competition, while the two
smallest halls finished in the lower half.
The material the halls get is about the same
—it’s the numbers that count!

Perhaps some plan can be worked out to
equalize the halls in respect to membership.

Review---

SATURDAY, MARCH 2, 1940

In this part Margaret Currier
gave a stellar performance—in a.
role that is difficult because it
contains no elements of glamour,
but must depend for its effect on
,intclligence and a pathos that is
entirely free from sentiment.
Perhaps the finest tribute to
the real greatness of the play and
the histrionic merit of the Grin.
liell performance is the fact that
an audience which was inclined
to take the play lightly was com.
pletely silenced and overwhelmed
when the curtain fell on that ma-
jestic and terrifying last scene.

S’rudenl' Cril'icizes 'iPioneer Day' Plan

 

OPEN FORUM l

To the Editor:

in regard to the recent resolu-
tion of the student Council, sub~
stituting for Victory Days the so»
called Pioneers Days:

The Victory Days of the past
few years have not been satis-
icctory; they have been with-
out an organized and orderly
plan of celebration, they have
been used for almost everything
else but: for celebration. This
evil situation reached the depths
after last season’s Cue game;
that was anarchy pure and
simple. What was to be done?
Organize the victory day, sail]
some. But it is evident that u
too highly organized Victory
Day would cease to be a Victory
Day because all the spontaneity
would go out of the celebration
and with it all the true spirit.
The ideal Victory Day lies some-
where hetwcen these two ex-
tremes: it must he planned so
that there is adequate celebra-
tion; it must not do away with
the spontaneity of the sitmiimn.

The resolution which the Stu-
dent Council passed seeks to or-
ganize the Victory Day; actually
it supplant: victory Day with
something entirely different, a
pep day before a game, or ascbcel
picnic in the spring. Are these
spontaneous celebrations of a
great Grinnell Victory? Can the
Student Council have pep and our
thusiasm made to order for a
certain day or a certain game?

The student Council explains,
“You can trike the days when
ever you like; but you can only
have two. However, we don’t
think that there will be enough
victories to use up the two next
yenr, and so you can have a any
in the spring for it picnic. And
so you will get two days oii next
year whether we win or not."
is that not a most optimism
statement? And just when we
have more justification to be
optimistic than at any time in
the past three or tour yen-s.
And what will that pessimism,
coming from the students' re-

 

presentatives, do to the spirit
which is being reborn and res
vived ht Griluiell? I‘ll tell you.

Says the student, “If I sit on
my seat and give the team no
backing, I will get two days off
in the year. If I get out and
work, and cooperate with the
team and give it some of my time,
no matter how hard 1 Work I will
still get only two Victory Days.
So why work?" is this the way
to encourage Grinncll spirit?

it is easy to tear down, you

say, but I have thought a little
about building. First, let there
be no maximum or minimum
set; to do so would be to kill
the essence of spirit, spontane—
ity, Let the students earn what
they get and get what they
earn. Next, let there be a com-
mittee or students set up to ace
cide whether the victory really
deserves a Victory nny. Let it
consist of the president of t-‘ic
Student council to represent the
men, the president of the Lea-
gue Board to represent the wo-
men, and the president of the
Honor “G" Club to represent
the athletes, who win the actual
victories. This group is small
enough so that it can be easily
brought together; it is inicl .
gent enough to withstand pres-
sure from irresponsible students.
Let it decide and then send its
request to the president of the
college, or to the choir-man of
the Faculty Athletic board, who
should know the athletic situa-
tion. 15 this not check enough
upon irresponsibility? There
would not have been 2L Victory
Day after the Con game lost
scnson had the president of the
student Council or the president
or the college been present lit
the game.

if the council wants to abolish
the principle of Victory Days, let,
it say so. if it wants merely‘ to
reform and purify them, let it for- ,
get the pop day and the picnic,
for they do not belong in the same
breath with Victory Day.

two acts. indeed, Oswald's speech
about the insurmountable costs of
marriage presents an obstacle that
no actor can successfully hurdle.
In the last scene Oswald’s trage-
dy is so literally stunning that
he gains a new nobility, and the
restrained acting of Alfred Boye
len rose nobly to the occasion.
The real star of the play is of
course Mrs. Alving, one of the
great women cf world literature.
