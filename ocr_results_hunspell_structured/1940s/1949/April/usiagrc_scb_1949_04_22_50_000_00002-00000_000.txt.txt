Freedom And Flexibility“

and the most

2

 

As the end of the school year approaches
elegant season of all begins to be noticeable, many’s the
young man’s fancy that will be lightly turning. But not all
will be turning toward romance. Comes also that time of
year when a batch of hoary platitudes always seems so much
in order, namely, graduation flay,

As tlie New Yorller Magazine's cliche expel-t might well
put it, “The time has come for these bright young hopefuls
to quit sese cloistered confines thesc ivy»covered halls,
which have for the past [our y (1'5 been the scene of tlieil
maturation from boys to men and strike out for themselves
in our brave new world, there to make their places in thei
sun . . . unafraid and strong in their determination to .

But with these thoughts» 1' the momentous day of thei
degree, of the new life so diflerent to come, of the shift
away from academic to ultra-realistic lifeiwe can’t help
Wondering about just what leally does lie ahead. ,Lacliing
the machines necessary for devining the future wev'can only
read the daily paper, listen to the clatter of the radio, and
Study antiquity. .

What we come up with almost invariably is a feeling of
frustration thrust upon us by a world apparently shot
through with belligerency and dire foredodings. We find
our vocabularies forcibly enlarged by such distasteful words
as revolution, Cominform, economic royalism, cold wars, and
defense pact. We are told that the bloom is off the boom
and that unemployment is back with us. Corps of experts
bombard us daily with diametrically opposed opinions ape
parently designed primarily to confuse.

This world which we will face must not be an insoluable
problem. In the murky glimmering: of our virtually opaque
crystal ball there seem to be only two symbols that mean
anything. They are in the words FREEDOM and FLEXL
BILlTY. \ '

Freedom means not only the basic freedoms that lie as
bedrock for our constitution, but also the freedom of mind
that comes through education and analytical meditation on
the cogent problems of the hour.

Flexibility is something that also must come through
education. We must develop a mental resiliency that will
give us the ability to grow and to shrink, stand under ex-
treme pressure of defeat and accept success with calm ap
preciation of personal achievement.

Regardless of the vocation into which we cast our lives
we must always be ready to adjust, be flexible enough to
change, These places in the sun in which we find ourselves
are in ever-present danger of dropping into shadow. Only
by being imbued with the idea of the ‘broad horizon‘ can we
be prepared to creep back into light again. ‘

The answer to the problems that we must ineVltably
face~of the world and the communityimay rest in our
ability to assimilate and practice freedom and flexibility of
mind. The keys to peace and security and progress must

be the object of our practice.
