llear Sir:

The other day, while stands
ng in the loggia, I heard the
following statement: ”The great

hite mother and her slant eyed
squaws just fined nie ten dollars
ius twenty days in the study
ohn for drinking. Can you im-
gine it?" That statement rep-
resents a deplorable situation
‘ hat has arisen at Grinnell, and
I think it is time something is
.one about it,

The girl who made that states
lment was actually protesting her
.unishrnent for drinking in vie
olation of the rules, although
she had known very wellt that
it was a violation. And I heard
her say later that she “would
certainly like to kno'w who
turned me in."

I have always been proud of
attending a nonrdrinking col—
lege, with its nondrinking fac—
ulty, and its nonrdrinking stu~
dent body. Recently, however,
it has been ,more and more ap-
parent that the licentious rot of
intemperance is gaining a foot—
hold upon our campus. Liquor
is a vicious enemy. I think it
time that we prepare to wage a
vicious war against it. if we
don't, not only the student 'body
ut even the faculty may be en-
gulfed in its mad, impassioned
decadence.

in the first place, the fines
should be increased. Six—hun-
dred dollars for the first “beer,"
the price doubled with every,
drink thereafter. is not too much-
I should say. In addition, any
girl caught drinking with men‘
should be prevented from fur-
ther dating for the duration of
the school year during which

‘Student Critic Finds Kroll Quartet
Performance Greatly Rewarding

By Ernest Lcihcr

During last night‘s perforr
mancc or the Kroll quartet,
someone turned to us and said;
“There’s more to Mozart in this
quartet than I have ever found
betorct" The truth of this state—
ment. is by now hackncyed. The
wealth of‘ ideas and
thoughts is to be found in such
musicibettel‘ known as sham»
her music. Herc we have four
individual instruments, each re—
sponsible for his own part;
there can be no covcring up, noI
fancy frills, and flourishes; it
is all music. For that reason it
demands more careful attention
from the listeners. Such words
as dry, barren, slow and dull,
could hardly be applied to last
night’s concert. rroin beginning
to end, It moved at an evcitmge
ly dramatic clip. When such mug
sic is known and studied. its
performance can be greatly roe
warding. Like all things of a
complex nature, it must have a
responsive audience,

Mozart Subtle

The Mozart quartet was rillecl
with surprises,- not loud ones or
ones that are “tricky;" but
subtleties, such as we find only
in this type oi music; the de—
vious ways in which Mozart
returns to his main theme; the
quaint way in which he ends
