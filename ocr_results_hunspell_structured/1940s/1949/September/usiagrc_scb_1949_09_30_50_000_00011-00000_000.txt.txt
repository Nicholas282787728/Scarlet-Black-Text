laughed hollowly and muttered,
“I seem to have lost my muste

I thought I'd become quite at

“What else did you do," asked
our reporter, breaking the si.

THE THREE ELMS

The effect of formal “educae
tion” courses on the teaching
profession is “catastrophic,"
Prof. Harold L. Clapp of the
Grinnell college modern for.
eign languages department as.
serts in an article, “The
stranglehold on Education" in
the recently published summer
Bulletin of the American Ase
sociation of University Profesv
sors.

“Education” courses “inter-
fere with real education," he
says, because “subject~mdtler
requirements for teachers are
pitifully inadequate. There is
much too little time to study
the subject one is to teach when
so much time is taken up by
courses in HOW to teach. Cons
sequently. the appalling fact is
that our most poorly educated
college graduates are our teache
ers."

“Educationists,” says Dr.
Clapp, have been concerned
“not with improving standards.
but with maintaining and
strengthening a set of meaning.
less, mechanical requirements
which are in no sense a meas
ure of teaching ability or gen—
eral fitness for the profession.”

State requirements, he adds,
"make no distinction between
the dullard and the Phi Beta
Kappa” but “have established
the same license for both."

Asserting that ”education"
courses and textbooks are “pade
ded" and “diluted," Prof. Clapp
urges that time devoted to tech
lnical teacher—training be cut to
“a quarter or a third of the time
no wdevoted to them" to give
the student time for academic
