Pioneers Win 2.
Hold Second Spot
In Midwest Loop

In their last games before Sate
urday’s meeting with conference
champi n Beloit. the Grinnell
Pioneers took two out of three
games from conference oppon-
ents over the weekend.

Up in Cedar Rapids Friday
night, Grinnell was shocked by a
rejuvenated Coe team playing
their lost loop game, the result
being a 51-43 defeat at the
hands of theKohawks. The Coe
victory was their second in sev~
eiiteen starts, but even with this
win they couldn't climb out of
the Cellar.

Paced by Newell Lash, the Cue
five was leading at the half 264
20, but Grinnell came back in
the second period to tie the
score twice. Coe took a 3261
lead, and then clinched the win
with a staight points. Bob Eige-
low‘s 13 points was Grinnell’s

~ highest mark, while Lash led the
Coe quintet with 23.

The following night Monmouth
invaded Darby, seeking a repeti-
tion of last week’s 6153 Win
over the Pioneers. Threatened
with loosing their shaky hold on
second place, the Scarlet and
Black triumphed 62-54. The game
was nip and tuck all the way,
until Mcllvain, the Scot center,
fouled out late in the second
half.

As usual, Don Armstrong led
the Monmouth attack, this time
with 18 points. Dave Dunlop led
the Grinnell attack with 20
markers.

Tuesday night the Grinnell
Rams met the Pioneers for the
third time this season. The two
teams had split in their previous
meetings, but the rubber game

SPORTS SIDELIGHTS

Ramblings

Win or lose tomorrow night
against Beloit. the Pioneers have
second place cinched in the con—
ference race, thus completing
thu most successful basketball
season since 1940. when the Fio-
ncers ended in a tie for third
place in the conference. A big
round of applause should be
given Coach Pfitsch. who, in his
first year here at Grinnell, has
done a tremendously good job
in giving us the best team we’ve
seen in a long. long time.

Not to be forgotten either are
the team members themselves.

So, no matter what happens

could ask for a better coach and
