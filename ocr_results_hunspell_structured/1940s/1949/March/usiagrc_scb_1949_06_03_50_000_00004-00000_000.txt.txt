lStudent Employment - - - '

i,-

Se al months have gone by since the last editorial
concerning student employment appeared here. Since that
time tlle Student Employment Committee, which has met
'wi'th President Stevens to consider problems of employee-
administl-ation relations and student wages, finding the atti-
tude of the administration to be more obstructive than con-
ciliatory, has subsided and practically ceased to exist.

We bring tllis distasteful problem to your attention at
this time because we feel it must be faced by both pr es.
The general deterioration of the service ill Cowles dining
room, (from bad to worse) and the year's great turnsoveuoi
help in the Union, are indications that all is not well with
the student employment situation.

When the present problems of personnel management,
super lsion and training, and efficient scheduling have been
solved we will still find that tlle basic element oi a good
working atmosphere is incentive Though there are many
students on campus who are willing to stand around and
swap jokes for 50 cents per hour, there are hardly a hand-
ful who will willingly work for less than 75 cents an hour.
This is a cold economic and psychological fact which villl

/ llbt change so long as costs, particularly at Grinnell college,

k hi h. p
are S sidgent Stevens is \\ ell known for his abilities in the

field of labor relations. We suggest that he give more care

flil consideration to the needs and opinions of the students
here who most urgently need this consideration

We further" suggest that those students who return
next fal give this problem serious thought, and prepare to

 

   

    

 

 

act. W' hful thinking never got anybody a raise.

Dear Editor:

Once upon a nine. in tho dis.

rabbits were urn-rod and [res of
many 01' the corcs or the world,
For exutemcnt, th)’ used to
shp down to the beach at night
and dance by the light 01 the
moon»man. Their moonrman was
glistening silver and had three
rings around him. When their
moonrm'dn shown bright they

skip, turn and twirl, glide and

rabbits were happy at this sport

chose the wrong partnersiper-
hops they were not yet skillful.
Some never appeared on the
beach. These were dismissed as
misfits.

One day an idea set the rabv
bits to talking rapidly. gesturing
and debating. The public toruin

became a crowd of thought

have a better moonsman,” they

said. "There are far-off moons

Cont. on page 16

On Thursday, Feb. 17. the State Fire Prevention asso-
‘cintion camc to the Grinncll college campus to report viola-
:tlons oi the fire code of Iowa to the admin ,[l' tion. The
next day the 5&1} carried a story taking the administration
‘to task for the carelessness they had permitted in these
matter. One of the most direct results of this and the other
iS&B stories was the removal of students’ pe tonal electli-
‘cal utilities. By this means the administration threw the
responsibility for fire ha irds right back at the students.

Next, a comprehensive report was sent by the associa-
tion to the administration recommending certain improve—
ments. This was sent back to the Association with the com-
lnent that it was vague, general, incomplete, and inaccurate,
and a demand was nlade for a revised report. However, it is
to the credit of the administration to note that they said
they would comply with certain of the recommendations
These compliances are mostly in regard to wiring viola-
tions We must add, though, that even these changes will
be made “when and if funds ar available" and “if they are
deemed necessary" by the admilf tration.

_Early in the summer a detailed report “ill be given the
administration correcting as much as is possible the errors
and omissions made by the association. This report will
come from the 3&1} and will include recommendations as
well as observations on the fire violations. We expect REAL
improvements, not just ,those for expediency or superficial
ldecoration.

We also expect funds to be MADE available for these
improvements and that the administration WILL DEEM
THEM NECESSARY.

If the administration takes pains to see that violations
are corrected, the students can feel that their lives are
respected.

Make SC Plans

JIn reviewing the record of
Frank Sanders. retiring Student
Council president, it is rememv
'rigrcd that on Spring Day of ’48
Senders iullilled one or his cam-
ptign promises by overseeing
the construction of a new walk
between ARH and the book
si 'e. with c of HP labor.

,x’During Frank’s term, the
councn installed coke machines
if; the quadrangle and men’s
}- 'lls, reVlSed the Council Consiiv
t on, and introduced a petition
em in the election procedure
16 Council president. Sanders
aiso worked with his committee
on an investigation of the col»
lege wage situation and the
point system.

lThe 1948 Council joined the
National Student Association,
and backed the local NSA group
in various projects, including
bringing of six DP students to
iiie Grinncll campus, setting up
a purchase card plan and face

Lately, Sanders and Earl Feis-

her, his successor, have been
working on an effective honor
system.
n regard to quallfyihg examr
inations, Peisncr, although he
does not believe a student should
lie required to Lake qualifying
exams over a course already
passed, does not think the qual
system should be completely
dropped.

{lPelsncr also plans to expand
college recreational activities,
