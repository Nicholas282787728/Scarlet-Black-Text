PRO and CON

Do you favor the rules change compromise introduced in the
Senate by Senator Alvin Barkley to limit Senate debate?

This issue arises because the
Senate prides itscli on freedom
of debate and because important
social legislation (civil rights
but also much else) is in the
making. Essentially it is a prob
lem of balance — between too
much ireedom oi debate and, too
little. Too much ireedom to talk
in effect leads to too little. 1
favor a compromise under which
a vote of tworthll‘ds oi those
actually present can close debate
on a bill or motion. The serum-
ed Republocratic bloc may get
a weaker rule through.

The present debate in
Senate over the reform or the
eloture rule appears to be a

quibble over terms But the
basic principle of democracy,
the right [or the maioi-ity to axe i
press its will, is at stake. Even‘
the improved, proposal allowing
[Warihll‘ds Of tl’lOSi‘ present to
limit debate does not go far
enough. President Truman’s Sen.
atershocklng proposal for a
simple maiority to close debate
was no such compromise with
democratic procedure If a simr
ple majority can pass legislation,
then a simple majority should
have the right to bring a pier
motion or measure up

Dear Sir;

The campaign ior tho pre'sidena
cy of the Student Council by
Stu Doeder will go down in
Grinnell history. What Stu said
by implication is true: when the
names and campaigns of the nth
er candidates and their cam.
paigns have become dim meme
ones, the name or Stu Roeder
and his campaign will remain
vivid. without Stu’s campaign
pranks. the election would have

'been dull indeed.

’It is our opinion and that oi
a great many others with whom
we have spoken that his talents
for putting lift: into campus aCA
tivities should be utilized. We
believe that Stu Roecler is the
ideal chairman for Gadabouts
{or the next college year. To

,‘this otiiec he could bring abili-

ty, a unique gift for publicity
and above all, FUN to the camr
pus.

Sincerely yours,
Edward w. Lawlor
