Vikings Wrest
17- 10 Victory
From Pioneers

Inexperienced Grinnell met Aug-
ustana college in wrestling Sat-
urday afternoon in Derby gym and
was defeated 17-10. The Vikings,
who lost only one match lastyear,
appeared to be in better condition
than the home team and won five
of the individual matches,

Perhaps the brightest spot for
the Grinnelliana was Dave Segur's
fine showing in the 121 pound di-
vision. Segur pinned his strong
Augie opponent wm: a double bar
arin in the first round, giving his
tum ﬁve points.

The Grinhell game makes the
third contest for the Carls this
week. Tuesday they lost to St.
Olaf 61-47, and this evening the
Maize and Blue is being entertain-
ed by Cornell college at Mount
Vernon.

1h conference play Carleton has
beaten Ripail and lost to Lawrence
and Beluit. The visitors sport on
over-all season’s record of 4 vic-
tories against 5 setbacks.

Against Ripon, the Pioneers
were concerned with the Redmen’s
6‘ 4" center, Bob Weiske, but set-
urday night they’ll have to watcn‘
Jack Thurnblad, a 5' 8" forward
who has been an all-conference‘
selection for the last two seasons.
He has led the Carleton ouiﬂt in
scoring during that time, and cur-
rently holds the Carleton seasoni
scoring record.

Thumblsd dumped in 285 points
to score further, and the contest
was declared a draw.

Encountering some stiff compe-
tition, Rick Wentland and hureni
“Pickles" Lindseth lost their bouts
on points in the 165 and 175 di-
visions. Heavyweight Bud Gregg
continued his winning streak by
out-pointing his foe 4-0, Although
Gregg had the advantage through-
out the match, he was unable to
pin his Viking opponent.
