SPORTS SIDELIGHTS

Ramblings

Hy Bernie Beggan

With the winter sport schedule completed, it seems apparent
that Grinnell's athletes might well be a bit proud ot their records.
Dave Dunlop's conference average of 14 points was the highlight
ing ioctor in the Pioneers drive into the second place Slot in the

loop scramble

Assisting nave were sophomores Bob Bigclcw, Bill

Toomey, Walt Poke], and Dave Ankli, all of whom did a commends
able job Mel Adams. Verne Hull, and Jim Heiny were right there
too, backing up steady “Gas” Saunders, sqiiinting George Kessel,

and fighting Eal'l Pcisner

Over in the swimming pool,
Stan Hall and his confederates
copped a third in Saturday’s
loop meet. Sophomores Tom
Rigler, Don Jessen, Bob Risse,
Bob Zeitler, lack Edgren. and
Skip Kingery all showed prom.
ise of being standouts on next
year's tank team.

On the mats, Grinnell gave a
superb showing. Led by unbeat»
en Bud Gregg, and the two
Davos, Segur and Theophilus,
the wrestling team seemed to
grow stronger as the season pros

heavyweight crown last week.

Last tall Gregg, an economics
major, won his letter while
playing tackle on the Pioneer

vfootball team.

The Smith junior is undecided
about his plans after graduation
in Feb, 1950

i

gressed. The entire squad was
impressive as they finished a
strong Second to defending
champion Cornell.

The indoor trackmen are in
for a bit of glory too, Saturday
in Naperville, Ill, the Scarlet
and Black thinclads garnered a
fourth out of a field of 18 com-
peting in the Midwest invites
tional meet. John Bonyata, Bill
Smiley, and the relay teams
were the pointsgetters who helps
ed in finishing off a brief yet
encouraging indoor track season.

Yes, it was a successful wrnter
season. But don't overlook those
who helped make it possible.
Coaches Pfitsch, Slaughter,
Brown, and Berry all worked
hard and long to bring about
the atmosphere of success which
accompanies the termination of
the winter sports campaign.
