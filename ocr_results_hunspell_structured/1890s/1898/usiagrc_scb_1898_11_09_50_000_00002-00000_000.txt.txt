Ox NE Saturday will occur
the only game importance
which will be seen on the home
grounds this year. The old gold
and scarlet and black are to meet
in their annual contest, and a bat-
tle royal is assured. The team of
the State Unlversity comes here
smarting under recent defeat, and
will undoubtedly put up the
strongest game they have played
this season against their old ene-
mies. The crippled condition of
our own team makes the prospect
of a victory even more uncertain
than previously. The 'Varsity is
walking hard to ﬁll the gaps
made in its ranks by the contest
with Penn College last week, and
ought, with hard and faithful
practice, to round into fairly
good lorrn by Saturday. But
the responsibility ot our winning
the game does not rest on the
players alone, but on the wllole
student body ot lotto College.
No team can play its best game
without support'from the side
lines. So far, this year, the col-
lege yell has been an unknown
quantity, but we have an oppor-
tunity of showing thrrt our col-
lege spirit is not (lead yet, and
this opportunity ought not to be
neglected. one very important
factor in seeming the victory over
Amcs last year was the enthusiast-

Dr. John Henry Barrows.

The ﬁrst number of the Y. M.
c. A. lecture course will be given
Friday evening, Nov. it, by Dr.
Barrows. His subject is “The
world Pilgrimage, with Experlr
enees Serious and Not so Serious.”
In a letter to the writer, Dr, Barr
rows says he regards this as the
lnost attractive of any ol his lec-
tures, chiclly for the reason that
it is adapted to all classes of
minds.

Dr. Barrows is a man of wide
experience and culture, whose
brilliancy as a speaker always
pleases his hearers. He is it Came
in] thinker and writer whose
books are substantial contribu~
tiorls to the literature of our pres-
ent day. His work in connection
with the World’s Parliament of
Religions was in itself a great
achievement, and hits made his
name world-wide.

As a recognition ot this work,
he was called by the Univelsily of
Chicago to deliver the Haskell
Lectures in Calcutta and other
East Indian cities. From this
world tour he has recently return

ed, and it is upon the experiences
ot it that he will speak Friday
night. He is of Special interest
at this time by reason of the fact
that Oberlin College has just call»
ed him to its presidency.

Wilson College for Women,
Chambersburg, Pa, is to have a

new dormitory to cost $75,000.
