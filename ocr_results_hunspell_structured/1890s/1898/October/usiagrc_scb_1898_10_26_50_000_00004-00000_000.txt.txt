Ebe athlete.

The football practice has been
fairly good during the past ten
days, considering the fact that
about half of the varsity men are
inure or less crippled and unable
to take opposition work, Sew
ornl have not been able to take
even signal practice. Still it is
not what it might have been or
what ought to have been ex
pected. The men seem to under
estimate the strength of the learn
they are next to meet or else the
value of hard consctcntious work
when preparing for a big game.

It is only by incessant hammer-
ing that the coach and captain are
able to get any speed in the for-
mation or spirit in either offensive
or defensive play. Even attcr all
the efforts of the management the
plays could bear to be run fast
er and no one has said that the
formation is perfect yet. Too
much attention cannot be given to
these two points, speed and exact-
ness of formation, as they are what
make the plays gain ground.
More care in this direction will
not be lost.

The men who are unable to take
work against the “scrub" should,
by all means, take a good run
every afternoon atterslgnal prac-
tice, so as to keep themselves in
the best possible condition. We
are sorry to say that in some
instances this has been sorely
ncglccted. Most or those who
pretend to take a run do it so
slowly and indifferently that'they
cannot get much good out of it.
\\'e uuuld like to see those. who
are somewhat dlsabled, take a
brace in this respect and show
that they do not think they are so
good as not to need any training,
It is indced a new state of affairs
in Grinnell if there is anyone on

 

the ﬁeld who does not need the
best kind of training, whether he
lS temporarily too much crippled
for opposition work or not. Gllll'
nell has always won on her super
tor nerve and training and not on
account ofany prodigiotlsslrcngth
or endurance in the individual
players. When one is unable to
receive the beneﬁt otthe practice
afforded by the scrub he should
deem it of more than ordinary lms
portancc that he keep himself in
the best of physical condition, so
that this would in some measure
counterbalance his less or pracs
tice. This IS of especial llnpors
tance when one of the hardest,
and probably the hardestgameol
the season, is at hand. No one
has bccn able to doubt that Nee
braska has a strong team, and the
fact that it dclealcd Missouri by
a score of 4675 is very weighty
evidence that it is the strongest
team we are to meet this en. It
is to be hoped that her strength
will be realized by the players bee
fore they begin the game. and
that they will not think they can
beat Nebraska simply because
they have not as high a reputation
as Minnesota.

Were one to judge the result of
next Saturday‘s game by that’ot
last Saturday. the judgment would
be tar tram ﬂattering to Grinncll,
However, our team is not in the
habit of putting up that sort of a
game, and we can expect some»
thing radically differentwheu they
come against a team that is very
apt to prove itself superior, and
when only the hardest effort can
avoid defeat.
