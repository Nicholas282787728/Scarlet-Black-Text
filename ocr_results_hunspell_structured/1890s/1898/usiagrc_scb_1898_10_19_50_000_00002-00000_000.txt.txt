ON ME. . liriday will occur
the examination at those who are
desirous of competing for the var
cant places the Glee Club
The openings this year are much
more numerous than last year, as
there are three vacancies in the
second bass, one iii the ﬁrst bass,
and two in the ﬁrst tenor, so that

on

a goodly number of candidates 2|

ought to be on hand. The Glee
Club, from a small beginning, has
become one of the most iinporlant
oi the college organizations, and
its inﬂuence and reputation have
grown .with each succeeding scar
son. Its home concert, given in
Grinnell early in the spring, is al-
ways eagerly looked iorward to,
and its yearly trips through varir
ous portions of the state
done much to advettise the col
lege, and have been un'ilormly
successful. The success of the
club cati be traced directly to Pio-
lessor Cole, who organized it in
the ﬁrst place. and has been untir-
ing in working for its best inter-
ests ever since. The training
which the membcl'sof the club ree
Ceive under his leadership is.
itself, a valuable incentive for len'
ing. The success of the club this
year. as is evident from the ntlm~
ber of vacancies, depends upon
the new material which is taken
into it. The advantages of mem-
hership are obvious. Etery stu-
dent who has ever sung or has
any hope oi singing in the future,
should take this opportunity, and
be present at the examination
next Friday at
o’clock.

It
is to be remembered that the
Athletic Union stutted out iiith a
large debt this fall, and so long as
this remains, just so long will nth-i
leties be hampered by it. While
a snittll portion of this debt was
cleared t\\\‘dy by the proceeds
from the Drake game, tlieie yet
remains a debt oi about tliiec
hundred dollais. Oti next Satur»‘
day occurs the {list game on the
home grounds, and it will serve to
showjiist how far the loyalty of
the students and their tiiletest in

There will be but three games on
the home grounds this year. and

In LHE tennis tournament held
at Iowa City last Saturday, be
tween Griniiell rind S. U. l, the
latter were Victorious, winning eve
ei‘y set, though the SCDICS were
close. An examination of them
would show that Grinnell played
very good tennis, and the iesult
was not nearly certain until the
games were all played. The ﬁrst
match was played between lind-
doclc, of S. U. 1., and Hitgelice, oi

U. l., and Wald, of Grinncll; the
third by \‘Villsll and Mitrsll, of S.

and I’Iolbrook, of S. U. I. and
Ward and Halsey, of Griiinell.

U. I. Went down before Drake last
Saturday by the score of 18 to 5.
It was a battle of Pennsylvania

in team woilr, which was almost
perfect.
