many things have been written

spirit of fairness and rationalism
that is well worth repeating in

education, a clear-headed and
practical administrator, a diplo~

display of his personal talents.
but as a sacred trust to be held by
him for the permanent welfare of
the institution over which he temr

Athletics at Iowa University.

Athletic affairs in our sister in
stitution have again reached a ci ,
real point. as is evidenced by a;
communication published over tlie‘
signatures oi l’itifessois suns, Ely
and Shambaugh,
men call attention to thc lact that
Athletic Union has been allowed
to pass practically out ol existr
encc; no attempt having been
made to comply with the tequileri
mcnt of its constitution that all
members of athletic learns shall
be members at the Union. and
nothing havtng been done ton ard
organization. The students
mee 'ng last year made
pledges sutrcient to cover the
then existing obligations. and on
the strength of these pledges the
friends at athletics borrowed mon-
cy and paid all athletic debts.
Since then about 5300 has bccn
added to the indebtedness but
there has been absolute y nothing
done toward the lulnlling ot thc a
pledges. The mhlelic oliiltinlt for
the base-ball and [tacit teams lS
very promising, but because ofthe
atrophied condition ot the athletic
organization the faculty may ﬁnd
it necessary to abolish all fotins of
athletics. To avoid this it is sug-
gested “that a self-appointed come
inittee ot students who have the
interest of athletics and the Unir
versity at heart shall assume
charge of this matter." The come
inunication closes With this seiir
tence: “We desire to add' that at
this time we do not believe in the
efﬁcacy or advisability of mass-
meetings."
