Calocagathia.

Yesterday's meeting of Caloca—
gathia promises a healthlul and
most interesting year's work.

Miss Ethel Hunt, the president,
began the program with an inau-
gural address.

Miss Marian Bruntlett gave a
talk on “Society Work." She
spoke ﬂuently and entirely with
out notes. emphasizing the need
of originality and recommending
that the programs be not of a na
ture that requires too much dig—
ging. She closed by urging the
girls to live up to the name Calor
cagathia, the beautiful and good,
“for the good requires honest efr
fort. and the beautiful exalts.”

Miss Bousquet sang in a very
pleasing manner and responded
to a hearty encore.

The advantages ofscciety work
were ably presenled by Miss Florr
ence Somers, '97, in a talk which
was all the more interesting since
spoken trom her own experience.
She said that as she looked back
upon her college work to decide
what was‘ wheat and what was
chaff, she unhesitatingly classiﬁed
her society work as the former.

The extemporaneous work by
Misses Hand, Richards, Pettit and
Morrison was very creditable.

The subject ot the next program
will be “Women in Athletics."

 

Ellis.

After a musical selection by Miss
Anger, the new president, Miss
Tate, in a quiet and digniﬁed man~
ner, assumed the chair, and in a
fewwell-chosenwordsemphasizcd
the value at society work as set
forth by President Gatcs' chapel
talk, and made clear the policy of
the year.

Miss McClanahan read a wellr
chosen selection from Stockton's
"Camping out at Rudder Grange,"
after which Miss Tyer gave ashort
talk on the culmination of the
Spanish American dii‘ﬁculties,
speaking especially of the new
impetus in social and political life
which has come to our country
with her new responsibilities.

The extemporaneous work of
the afternoon was of the highest
order and gave promise of a pros-
perous year’s work in that line.

Miss Orvis spoke of the most
proﬁtable way oi spending a vaca-
tion. Miss Tallman, ‘98, who
might have thought her day of
extemporizing upon the Ellis ﬂoor
was over. was called upon to show
the value ot the social phase of
college life.

Anna Moody discussed the na-
tional question, Shall we keep the
Philippines?

Y. M. C. A. Lecture Course.

The Y. M. C. A,, as is its usual
custom, has provided for the year
a lecture course, tickets to which
will be on sale during the coming
week. This year’s course is
probably the strongest one which
has ever been given by the Asso-
ciation, and will, without doubt,
prove very popular. The course
includes four lectures and one
concert. The ﬁrst lecture will be
given Nov. nth by John Henry
Barrows, who is best known by
the fact that he was President of
the World’s Parliament of RC
ligions which met in Chicago in
1893. Dr. Barrows returned
about a year ago from a journey
around the world, on which he
delivered more than one hundred
and forty addresses in India,
Japan and elsewhere, Since his
return he has met with unqualiﬁed
success on the lecture plattorm.
His lecture will probably relate
to his world pilgrimage.

The introduction of aconcert

 

company into the lecture Course
is an innovation which will meet
the approval of all college stur
dents, and will aid greatly in
making the course an interesting
one. This concert will be given
Dec. to, by a company consisting
of Max Bendix, violinist, Miss
jenny Osborne, soloist, and Miss
Jeanne Scott, pianist. Mr. Ben-
dix is well known as a musician.
violinist and concert~meister and
today is acknowledged by musi»
cians everywhere to stand at the
head of our American violinists.
For ten years he was concert-
meister in the Thomas Orchestra
and fora time was conductor of
the Exposition Orchestra at the
\Norld’s Fair. Miss Osborne is a
charming singer, gifted with a
soprano voice of wide range and
beautiful quality, while Miss Scott
is a pianist ofunquesticned merit.
This company comes to Grinnell
highly recommended by Prof.
Cole and will take the place of
the concerts which are usually
provided by the Conservatory of
Music.

The second lecture will be given
Ian. 20 by Will Carleton, the poet,
author of “Farm Ballads," "City
Ballads" hnd other well known
poems. Mr. Carleton will prob
ably give a reading irom one of
his own works.

The third lecturer will be Geo.
W. Cable, best known as the

writer who has pictured so vividly‘

the Creole life in the south.
Shortly atter the Civil War Mr.
Cablc settled in New Orleans
wnerc in addition to his other du-
ties he contributed articles to
scum/t [Wont/:47. The success
of these articles led him to devote
all his time to literary erforts.
During the past summer Mr.
cable has been on a successful
lecture tour in England.

The last number on the course
will be a lecture by Dr. Frank
Bristol, pastor oi the Mctlopolir
tan Methodist church in Wash
ington, D. c. oi which Pres. Mcr
Kinley isamcrnber. Thischurch

the Methodist churches of this
country, and to it Dr. Bristol was
called a short time ago from a
pastorate in Chicago.

usually expensive onc, costing in

all about seven hundred dollars,
but tickets will be sold forSI.25,
which is a smaller price than was
charged last year, as there will be
no extra charge tor reserved seats.
The Y. M. C. A. does not expect
to make money on the course but
they hope to be able to sell
enough tickets among students
and townspeple to pay all ex-
penses. The lecture course com-
mittee will have tickets for sale
