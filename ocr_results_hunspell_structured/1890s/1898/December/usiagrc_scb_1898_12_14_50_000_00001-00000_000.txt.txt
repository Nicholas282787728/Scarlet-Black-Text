Saturday’s Recital,

The recital given Saturday
afternoon by Miss Edna Proctor
assisted by Miss Atkinson, was
well attended and the interesting
program well rendered.

The ﬁrst number. a Sonatina by
Reinecke, was much enjoyed. par
ticularly the“Andante con moto,"
which Miss Ploctor played with
excellent legato touch.

The Back Menuet and March
and the Handel Sarabanda proved
her skill in staccato equal to that
in legato and they were given in
the stately style essential to these
classic compositions. Her rendere
ing of the Heller numbers gave
evidence of a good, clear tech»
nique, as did also the Chopin
Mazurkas and the Mozart Sonato.

Miss Aikinson sang in a most
pleasing manner two songs by
MacDowell and three charming
little songs by Prof. Cole.

Grinnell Institute.

The program of the Grinnell
Institute for December [0 was
opened by Mr. Gannaway. who
spoke on the “Life and Work of
the late Col. Waring." He gave
an excellent sketch of his life as a
reformer of New York City poli-
tics. and as a general in the late
wart The speaker proved him to
be an exemplary American citi-
zen whose life stands for the high-
est principles of justice. The
speech was well delivered and
highly appreciated.

Mr. Delavan's football story
was full of spirited descriptions
and had the vim and spirit ot the
game.

A Friday morning chapeltalk
by Mr, Parish on“Examinations"
was truly imitative of the presie
dent. showing superior knowledge
and judgment in knowing what is
good for the students, and display-
ing his ability to impose it upon
them in his truly democratic way.
The speaker's voice and delivery
revealed his close attention to
Friday morning chapel.

The cxtemporaneous work was
done by Waterman. Crandall and
snider. Each speaker proved his
good ability in this kind of work.
The Institute society takes just
pride in its large number of ex~
temporaneous speakers. In this
work the members of the Grinnell

Institute are second to none, but
we should not for that reason
make so much of our program
consist of this work. It gives a
sameness to the program which
could be easily remedied by more
music and a larger number of
wellrprepared productions.

The debate was on the question:
“Resolved. That Governor Tan-
ner's actions in the Virdcn affair
were justiﬁable." Lindsay and
Knapp ably upheld the afﬁrma-
tive; Dignan and Thompson the
negative. it was a good debate
for the reason that only a few
points were made but these were
argued in detail.

Chrestomathlan,

The program of the Chrestoma-
thian Society of last Saturday

for interest and enthusiasm has
been unexcelled this year.

Jones opened the program with
a review of one of Hamlin Gar-
land's latest books; giving a very
realistic outline of the story. sup
plemented byjudiciousquotations,
in a manner which commanded
the Closest attention. One Oi
Riley's dialect poems was ably roe
cited by McMartin. Although
his initial appearance before the
society Mr. McMartin acquitted
himself very acceptably.

The reading. by Calderwood,
was unusually good and was her
tened to with breathless interest.
Hamlin’s talk on Contemporary
New Zealand Politics was very in-
structive. and evinced considera»
ble preparation.

In extemporaneous work Meade
gave a very comprehensive talk
on "The President's Message.”
and Crabb a very ingenious expos
sition of the "Necessity of the Nic-
aragua Canal." When called up
on by the chair for the best book
they had read this year, Way de-
scribed his impressions of “Uncle
Tom's Cabin." and McCarty told
about the fortunes of the “Honor-
able Peter Sterling."

The question for debate was:

speakers showed thoughitul preps

commendable spirit. Nothing
adds more to the interest of a de-

are glad to notice a marked im-

judges rendered their decision in

Bendix-Osborn Concert.

Grinnell audiences have been
privileged to listen to solne partic-
ularly ﬁne concerts this fall, but
still another isin store for them in
the Bendix Osborancott concert.
which takes place Friday evening
in the Congregational chulch. be
ing the second of the Y. M. C. A.
Max Bendix ranks so
high among the great living vio-
Iinists that it seems hardly neces-
sary to speak of his attainments.
He combines a wonderfully large
and pure tone and elegance or
manner with a technique of great
brilliancy and certainty. He was
for ten years concert-master of the
Thomas orchestra and was chosen
by Ysaye to assist in a tour last
spring with Lachaume. Gerardy
and Marteau. Miss Jennie Ose
born is a singer of charming pres
ence. gifted with a dramatic so»
prano voice of wide range. clear.
richrtoned and full at force. Mr.
Matthews. editor of ziluxz'c, speaks
of her in the December number as
“one of the most brilliant young
sopranos among our concert singe
crs." She has sung with the
Thomas orchestra. the Chicago
Apollo Club, the Cincinnati Fes-
tivals. etc. Altogether it is one
of the ﬁnest concert companies
that has come to Grinnell for
many years, and will undoubtedly
be thoroughly enjoyed.

’98. We regret that a misstate-
ment in regard to Mr: F. o. Wyatt
was printed in last Saturday’s issue
of the SCARLET AND BLACK. It
was stated that a new church build
ing had been erected since he had
become pastor, and thatthere had
been large additions to the mem-
bership. Mr. Wyatt informs us
that the church was built previous
to his acceptance of the pastorate
at Chapin, and that there has been
no increase in membership. but a
decided growth in the size of the
congregation.
