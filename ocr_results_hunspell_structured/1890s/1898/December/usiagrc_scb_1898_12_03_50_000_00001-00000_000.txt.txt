I. G. SWAN, Sec’y.
Ellist

Miss Anger favored the society
with a piano selection after
which was given a program
on our new relations with Cuba,
Hawaii, and the Philrppine tsr
lands. The customs ot the peo-
ple, their characteristics and in-
tellectual development in the last
twenty years rvas clearly shown.
Their political and commercial
relations with the United States
and the assistance due them from
this countiy in establishing a ﬁrm
and reliable government was dis.
cussed at some length. Iiaraii
by Miss McIntosh, The Philip-
pincs by Miss Orvis and Cuba by
Miss Johnson. The last number
on the program was a pantomime
in charge of Miss Swancy.

Tile ballad of “Auld Robin
Grey” was selected. Miss Mehr
lin took the principal part or
jennie and Auld Robin Grey
was presented by Miss McClana
ban. The costuming rvas cspec~
ially good, representing Scotch
peasant live.

Calocagathia.

The program at Calocagathia
Friday atternoon was opened by
a song, Carpenter’s Norse Lullae
by, by Miss Nellie Clark, who
showed her accustomed case of
manner, and gracefully responded
to an encore.

Instead of the regular literary
program the society enjoyed a
talk by Miss Millcrd, who emphar
sized the value of art in our life
and education here. Miss Mile
lerti characterized the highest art
as universal, the art which has its
meaning to all mankind, the art
with the Vital touch. Art should
be suggestive rather than exhaus-
tive. Of the difﬁculties in the
way of true appreciation ot art,
the evil of sham admiration is
most wide-spread and injurious.
Individual interpretation of the

 

classics of art and literature should
be cultivated rather than avoided.
Miss Millerd brought home the
lesson that those who do not ap»
preciate the beauty of the nature
surroundlng them, the beauty of
sky and trees, will have no insight
intothatotthe greatmasterpieces.
We should not study about art,
we should study art. Miss Mit
Ierd's talk was both entertaining
and proﬁtable.

In the business meeting follow-
ing the lrterary program Miss
Kyle and Miss Carrie Lawrence
were voted in as members of the
society.

Next Friday atternoon the
society will give a minstrel show
under the management ot Miss
Marian Bruntlett.

1900 Bob-rider

The bob ride in which the class
of 1900 participated last evening
is unique in the class history on
account of the number present
and the general good time en-
joyed by all.

The expedition lett Chicago
Hallatabout6:30,thleelargebobs
doing duty as transports, and in
spite of bad roads, arrived in New-
burg in good time and spirits.

Here the party adjourned to the
K. or P. hall and partook of a
sumptuous oyster stew, a royal
banquet for their sharpened ape
petites. While waiting for re
trcshments to bc served they
passed the time by mazy whirls
ot a Virginia recl and various
timerhonored sports invented es-
peciallv tor such occassions.

The ride home was marked by
the same high spirits. but the
festivities of one hob load were
suddenly quenched by contact
with a snow bank, resulting from
an unexpected spill. No damages
were done however, and the
capsized untortunates picked
themselves up and went on their
way rejoicing.

It was somewhat al‘ter faculty
hours when the party arrived in
Grinnell. but no one of those
present will deny that this was
the most enjoyable gathering
that the class of rgoo has ever
held.

Miss Millard, Miss Rand and
Proi. johnson did duty as chap-

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL. IOWA, SATURDAY DECEMBER 3. 1898,

An Interesting Rellcr

There hasjrecently been placed
in the Alcovc»ot Iowa College
History in the library a level
which has an interesting history.
It bears the following inscription:

"Mr. M. W. Abbot in charge of
the construction of the ﬁrst coir
lege building in Grinnell, assisted
by C. D. Kelsey, completed the
third story in August 1858. After
the death of Mr. Abbot in Feb
ruary 1862, this plumb and level
came into my possession and re-
mained to the present time,june
20,1898. After nearly ntty years
ot service, its level and perpen-
dicular abilities are pertcct.
Though it ,has witnessed the den
struction of the ﬁrst college build-
ing by ﬁre and has seen trom its
ashes arise “Phoenix“-llke more
noble structures that were de
stroyed by an irresistible cyclone
in 1882, the motive and immortal
principles that were at the round
ation of these destroyed temples
for education were not destroy-
ed, and we are permitted now to
behold still greater and superb
structures that are plrrmb and level
with the advanced civilization
and intelligence ot this age.

The possessor ot this true and
tested implement of correct level
and perpendicular habits, having
no further use for its service, now
donates it to Iowa College tor
safe keeping. believing that the
college will in the future as in the
past, be a representation of those
principles that are plumb and
level, and keep pace with the
highest moral, scientiﬁc and eco-
nomic principles that may be ad
vanced by tuture generations.

C. D. KELSEY.

President Dwight, of Yale, has
tendered his resignation to the
trustees. He says that having be
come seventy years of age, he
feels too old to continue in ofﬁce.
