and novel manner by matching
quotations with their authors.
which taxed the literary knowl-
edge of faculty and seniors alike.
In the dining room the table was
beautifully decorated with smilax
and white roses, and presided over
by Misses McGrath and Viets.
Refreshments wele served by
Misses Brown and Cadwell, S. of

Destiny of England in China," by
Miss Carter.
