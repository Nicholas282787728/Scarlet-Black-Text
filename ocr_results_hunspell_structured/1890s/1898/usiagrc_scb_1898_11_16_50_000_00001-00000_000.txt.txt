spects. poor. in others. good. The
literary program could be carried
out only in par several members
being absent. Mr. Jones’ trill:
on “Contenipor-aneous [mm s,‘
though it showed evrdences oi ltr
ty preparation, was interesting and
wastvell received. Two extent-
poraneous talks were given, one
by Mr. Wylcy. on the "Recent
Election," the second by Mr.
Blodgctt. on the "Football Game.”
Miss Smith played two very prct-
ty solos, which wcrc niuch apprc.
eiated.

The feature of the evening was
the debate. The que rioii was the
"Free and uillttnitcd coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1,"
Every speaker was iicii prepared
and convinced everybody that he
believed just what he “as saying.
This is the real secret of success-
ful debating. A speahcr duuhb
ing or unccrtain or his own posi-
tion can never debate ertectivcly.
Messrs. Gricr and Meade t't‘prer
settled the afﬁrmative; M ssrs.
Hamlin and Owen the negative.
Mr. Meade made a sttong, logical
speech; Mr. Hamlin depended too
much upon documentary
deuce. Mr. Grier was the most
spirited of any. This is good and
necessary for strong debating. but
Mr. Grier showed a little Iaclt of
selfrconlrol. He can easily oven
eon-re this, and has the making at
a strong, forceful speaker. Mr.
Owen always presents histliotiglits
clearly and precisely. Tlieie' r
tendency on the part of all debat-
ers to depend rather too much
upon notes. It is important to be
able todiscard every thrup 0f the
kind as much as possible. Tiic
aFﬁrniative won the decision.
