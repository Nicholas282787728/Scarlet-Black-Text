THE SOCIETIES

Notwithstanding the great incon-
venience in having noelectric lights
the Chrestomathians held their
meeting Saturday evening as usual.
It was an off night for the literary
societies as is always the case after
a football game, and the Antes ris-

itors occupied nearly as many seats ,

in the audience as their own muw
hers. A short but well mull-ml
program was presented. \\'.
Bridge opened with a declamation
on “A Scene at Niagara Falls."
Evans followed with askvtch of

 

“Ruskin and his later works” which.

was valuable in containing much
original thought and showing a
cr cal study of Ruskin and hi
position among writers. Such pm»
ductions should be encouraged.
Threerminute speeches were giv-
en by Smith, McCornack and Kel-
logg on the subjects “Colitcrary
Societies,” “Athletic. versus So
ciety work" and “Topics of the
Week“ respectively. It is the ob-
ject of the Chrcstos to emphasize
especially this branch of their liter»
ary work as being one of the most
valuable and practical. The susr
sion closed with a debate on the
question, [tum/ml. that the conﬂict
between labor and capital, the past
year, has resulted in more harm
than good to the laboring man.
Stevens and Brown spoke on the

afﬁrmative, Kellogg and Peck sup-
porting the negative. The decision
was rendered to the afﬁrmative.

The Institute Society added one
more to the list of adjourned meet-
ings this term, not considering it
worth while to continue a session
without lights or members.

ORCHESTRA ORGANIZATION.

In organizing an orchestra it was
the aim of the originators to make
an organization to which both
Grinnell and Iowa College could
justly look with pride.

We see no reason why the town
and college should be kept dis-
tinct in matters which are of inter-
est to both. Accordinglythe best
available talent has been utilized
in the formation of an orchestra
which we hope will prove to be a
source of pleasureaud proﬁt to all
music lovers of both town and col»
lege. The following is the instru-
mentation, and membership as far
as completed:

:\flel's‘llp|\llr:lt the training table,
the ﬁrst and second teams EISSL'III-
bled in the parlors of the "Met”

is not only an excellent coach,
thoroughlyunderstandingthegame,
but what is of far greater import,
he possesses the faculty of i111part~
