Mr.- Edwin Markhamt

The opening lecture ot the Y.
M. c. A. course thisycar was giv.
on last night under most favorite
ble conditions. The church. wllile
not crowded, was well ﬁlled. very
few good seats being vacant. The
lecture was an admirable one with
which to begin the coursecoming
as it did from a man who has
posed so prominently before the
eyes of the nation the past year.
After a brief introduction b\‘
Prot. Main. Mr, Markham began
his lecture by saying that he had
received the attention of critics
since he ivrote his poem and was
minded to explain why he wrote
it and his interpretation of it. Mr.
Markham said in part: “I have
often been asked why I wrote
this poem. ‘The man with the
Hoe.’ In answer to this I
say that I was raised on a farm
and know every nook and cran—
nie of farm life. Life was hard
for me, “’tvay out on a Cali
fornia farm," but Ido not regret
it. There are great advantages
for a young man on a well :0“le
tioned farm. I was also a leader
of the bible and a believer of the
principles set forth therein. Fine
ally I the picture itself
and in it I saw a type; atype
of the industrial classes who ate
crushed and oppressed. I did not
have in mind the farmer but rath-
er the oppressed man; the stunted
man. Isawin him the accuser
of the world; atype ortlie man
who went from the hill of agony
to the hill of Cruciﬁxion-and for
this man the masters and the rule
ers are directly responsible. I
hold that we are not equally res
sponslblcin this world, The re-
sponsibillty of this man is noi ts
great as yours and mine because
responsibility varies with freedom.
The man with the [toe is not the
Garﬁeld on the tow-path nor the
Lincoln at the rail pile. Neither
is he the untntored savage. But

Saturday evening the society
dispensed with its icgtilai literary
program and spent the time iii
the trai \ clion of tnipoitant bus
iiiess, This meeting marks
the conclusion of one of
the most successful periods in
tllC history of Grinncll Institute
Never has the society been upon
it ﬁrmer b ' its ﬁnancial status
good; its membership limit has
been reached and more are seeks
ing admittance. and thc cntllllsir
asm maniii; ed in all the mCeb
ings bids tail to raise the stand-

 

ard of literary workto gratifying a
degree oi excellence.

The i-ciorin spirit, which is a
sign or a healthful awakening. and
which is doing so much for the
Institute, Saturday evening manie
tested itself in the adoption oi a
revised constitution. whereby
muclioftlie accumulated rust is
polished off, and articles stiiciecn
out or amended to meet the grow
ing demands of the society.

Following the adoption ofthe
revised constitution a new corps
ofofﬁcers was elected. Much of
the society's success during the
past term is due to the efﬁcient
and faithful some: of its oFﬁcers.
The president, together with his
as stantoriicers. has always had
the in'eiests of the society at
heart, and the present excellent
showing of the Institute is a proof
that they have not been idle.

The new ofﬁcers elected were:
President; Engellre; Vicc Presi-
dent; Elli Secretary. Morrison;
Mustcal Director. Davis;Chaplain,
Dignaii.

Following the custom of the
Institute, after the new ofﬁcers
were elected the society adjournr
ed to the “Met" for a social hour.
Mr. Lindsay acted as toastmaster.
and toasts were responded to by
Davis; Halsey, Frisbie, H. G.
Lyman and others. Campbell.
and Macaitncy added much to
the delight of the occasion by
their musical contiibutions,

Between munchcs of “ham

Grinnell Institute ended. with
satisfaction behind and a bright
outlook ahead.

In Eiiiope, it is s id. that one-
tliird of the university students
fall into premature graves un ac»

universities, onerthlrd die from

third govern the contineilttiEl.

The Intercollegiate debate be
tween Aineszii-id the State Nair
mill, which was held at Antes this
year. resulted in a Victory for
Amos. The question for debate
was: “Resolved that the present
method of electing United States
senators is plefel'able to a method
of election by popular vote."
Aines supported the afﬁrmative.
