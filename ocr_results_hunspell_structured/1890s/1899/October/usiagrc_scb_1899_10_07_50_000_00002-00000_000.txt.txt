IT is wrrn regret that SCARLET
& BLACK has again to speak about
the welfare of the Academy socier
ties. The worlz accomplished so
far this tall by the societies is not
what it should be and is not up to
the standard. For the last few
years a great deal of interest has
been taken in the work of the
Academy societies and a great
deal has been accomplished by
them. but this year the interest is
not taken that should be. Usuale
ly a great deal ot rivalry has exists
ed between the two Academy soe
cieties which added a great deal
to the interest shown by members
in their respective societies. This
fall one of the societies has drop-
ped out of existance and left all
the work to its rival. We have
now reference to the Philologians.
This is by no means the right
spirit tor the members ot this so
ciety to show. There is no need
now to tell the beneﬁts derived
from the society work as it is well
known to all students what is ac-
complished by this branch or col-
lege life, and it should not be fore
gotten that the beneﬁts derived
from the Academy societies has a
great deal to do with the welfare
or the college societies, For this
reason it is the duty of the mem-
bers of the society to see that
their work is or the highest grade,
The joint debates and oratorical
contests which have been held be»
tween the Lewis Literary society
and the Philologians have not
only created interest among the
members of the societies, but in
the college as a whole. There are
enough students in the Academy
to support two men's societies,
and it one at them is dropped it
will be injurious, not only to the
Academy, but to the college in
general. SCARLET & BLACK hopes
before long to see the Philologian
society again on its feet,

l900 Party,

Society halls were transformed
last night. It was not exactly
fairy land, but rather as though a
scene from the “Arabian Nights,"
or a page from "Aliccln Wonders
land" had been suddenly trans
ported into the realms of reality.

Clowns pirouetted in graceful
whirls which would have done
credit to Barnuni's circus; Cinder-
ella paraded with Old Black Joe,
and the secretary of “My Lord
the Duke of Piccadilly” with an
old negro inarnmy. Soldiers at
our late ivar mingled in pictur-
esque contusion with colored re—
tainers from an unknown land; a
ﬁercely sworded Scotchman held
peacettil conversation with Old
Mother Goose; ladies of a suspic-
iously masculine bearing danced
the cake walk with gaily attired
colored gentlemen, while natives
of the Celestial Kingdom associe
ated on friendly terms with the
aristocracy of the old Colonial
days. Numbers of black robed
monks and nuns added a touch of
sobriety to the picture, and like
the spirit of Christmas Present,
the college spirit cast its kindly
light over all.

Many exceeding ingentioiis and
handsome costumes
ti-ivcd tor the occasion, and many
surprises were in store when the
wearers of these costumes une
masked. atter the grand march.
in which all sorts of grotesque
couples participated.

were cone

Immediately after the masks
were removed, the social Commit
tee served delicious refreshments.

The rest of the evening was
spent in social conversation, ins
teispersed with music by the i900
quartet, composed of Messrs.
Waterman, Parish, Staat and
Crandall. A Virginia Reel or
imposing proportions concluded
the festivities oi the evening be
fore anyone realized that they
had really begun.

I900 has had many pleasant
gatherings. but none which can
excel the one held last evening.
