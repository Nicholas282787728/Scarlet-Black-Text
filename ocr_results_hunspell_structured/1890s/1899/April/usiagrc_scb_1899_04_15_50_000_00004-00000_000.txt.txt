If the student body responds
loyally at the nihisttel scat
,tlc Tuesday as llnvc the town
ll‘iellds of the College in LllC work
of preparation for the entertain-
merit, there is ltttle doubt that
the Athletic Union will i-cccivc a
big lift on its debt, 'l‘hc \vul'k
hasteally been in progress tor
ﬁve \vccks past; but this week
has been specially Crowded with
rehearsals; noi- wlll there be any
slackelllllg of the pace in the few
days remaining. Said one of the
end men today, who has been in
the last two mlnstrel shows: “We
are much latthcr along than at
this time last year. and will, be“
yond doubt, have a much better
show. The committee in charge
of the peirotnianco has received
most licaily Co-opcratiotl on every
side and has little (lollbt there wlll
be a gland rush when the sale
opens at McConiicll’s, Tuesday. at
one o'clock.
The base ball schedule fol this
year is given below and is one of
the best overpreparcd lo. a Grins

 

nell team. It has been arranged
on a paying basis and takes but
few school days. The number or
games spcalts well tor the success
of the team, for no practice can
doso mllcll good as a game with
ii strange team. There ought to
be nearly mice as many men out
as thcre is trying tor a place on
the team wtth this list of games
ln view. Grinnell audiences will
be iavoied with four good games
two of which are our best league
games and ought to draw large
crowds.
