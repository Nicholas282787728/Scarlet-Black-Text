Proi. Herron's Address.

Professor Herron gave the an
nual address before the Y. M. and
v. W. c. A., Sunday evening, in
the Congregational church. The
clrict thought ot the address was
man's relations with God and the
eternal world.

With the passing of the differ-
ent kinds of Christianity, Jesus is
gaining his ﬁrst real hold upon the
multitudes, and the gospels are
beginning to be read in the terms
or human experience. Although
Christ laid dolvn hislife, He came
into most complete possession of
it, a power of which no one can
rob Him. This power is to-day
mastering our everyday lite. and

_ remaking our thoughts and ideas,
The normal man, ifhe truly unders
stands himself, has this same powV
er ot taking up and laying dorvn
his lite. A man's universe is just
whathevesisliisinterestsin. The
world is just rvlratwe make it. The
greatest enemy of the world is
tear, upon which all the evils of
history rest. Our fears are all that
keep us from doing what is right.
Although the asserting of an ideal
may bring external disaster upon a
nlan, it cannot harm his real life.
The true idealist may go through
the world without fear. The true
Christian must have faith that God
is ever-present and sees every act,
Wearecontinuallybeforethejudg-
mellt seat. All inﬁdelity alld athe—
ism is founded on our unbeliei in
our ideals. We must establish our
faith on something that will make
our ideals higher. Love is the real
iorce and good of the universe,
Creation is merely the maniiest-
ation of love. It is the lack of
love that has brought sorrow upon
thc world. To acknowledge that
there have been conﬂicts between
men and interests. is to give up the
idea of God, to substitute the fates
of Homer for the faith of Jesus.
Everything works together tor
God. The time has come for
lormulate'd Christianity to pass
away, and for religion to be mani—
[ested in our lives. it rests upon
us to make life wllat it should be.
to live and shine forth tree and un—
bound until Christ shall come to

crown the age. .

Commencement Exerclses.

The Congregational church was
crowded Wednesday morning, the
occasion being the graduating eXr
crcises of the class of '99.

The program was opened by the
“MarchH from Carmen, rendered
by the Amphion Orchestra. to the
music of which the graduating

 

ﬁcarlet tmb Black

class made its cntrancc, following
which prayer wns oricrurl by
Rev. Hand. of Omaha. The ore
chestra thcn lcntlcred a second
selection, the “Glorlalln Over
titre," by Feiber, iii an excellent
manner. ’

President Gates introduced
Mayor 3. M. Joncs, of Toledo, 0.,
the speaker of the day. as one
who stood foremost in the solnr
tion of the labor questions of the
day; who was not a preacher, but
a doer.

Mayor Jones' address was a
manly and eloquent plea for the
recognition of the rights as human
beings oi those belonging to the
laboring classes, and a
much more extended notice than
can be given it. The main thought
which he brought forward was the
necessity of a forward movement,
in which every one should partiCis
patc. tor the elevation of mankind.
The present system of labor is a
terrible machine, which grinds
one man to atoms in order that
another may reap the proﬁts of
his toil. One man cannot gain
success without forcing some one
else to the wall. Therefore sucr
cess is not the thing to be sought.
We must beware of proﬁt. The
blind race after fortune should not
be the main goal of life. but rath-
er the endeavor to restore society
to such a condition that it will be
possible to follow the great r_ule
of Christ, “Do unto others as you
would have others 'do unto you ”

At present this rule is irnpossi.
ble. The relations of labor are
too complex. and interwoven to
permit such an adjustment, but
this need not be so in the future.
What the world needs now is men
who will make Christ's rule the
working law of their lives; who
will contl ibute their share to make

others happy. It is just here that
there is need of united error-t. Tire

world cannot be saved piecemeal
any more than a building can be
raised piecemeal. It must be
made a social universe for all and
by the help of all, and this it is
the mission at college bred men
and women to accomplish.

Mr. Jones reterred interestingly,
inillustrationotsomc ofhispoints,
to the political campaigns in To
ledo, by which he has become [as
nious. His whole manner was cars
nest and forceful. and left a lasting
impression upon all who heard
him.

ates, thirty in number, Two re-
ceived diplomas from the School

Commencement Concert.

All lovers oi good music could
not but enjoy the treat Mr. Cole
provided for the Commencement
concert. Miss Large isa thorough

 

musician. Her playing is both
intellectual and sympathetic but
never verging on sentimentality.
l-ler clear crit playing showed to
especial advantage in the Bach
prelude and fugue,

Perhaps the most enjoyable
number on the program was the
Sonata for Cello and Piano
which the ensemble was excellent.

Mr. Beebe draws a beautiiul
tone from his instrument, and in
the Ist and 2nd movements of the
Sonata his tone shading wasex-
ceptionally ﬁne. All his selections
were good.

Mr.Emcry was in good voicc
and his songs were artistically
rcndcred. The last song on the
program, “The Lass with the Del.
lcate Air” was charming, lravinga

Dedication of Men’s Gymnasium

One of the most enjoyable oc—
casions of the whole commence-
ment week was the laying of the
corner stone of the new Men's
Gymnasium, the exercises being
under the charge of the outgoing
senior class. While the proceed.
ings were simple they were most
appropriate and adequate.

The exercises were held in the
open air, on the newly completcd
gymnasium ﬂoor. The glee club
opened the program by singing
the “Scarlet and Black," following
which prayer rvas offered by Prof.
I.. F. Parker.

Mr. C. E. Fisher made the ad-
dress of presentation in behalf oi
the seniors, incidentally giving all
due honor to his class, and ex»
pressing the hope that the gymr
nasium might work toward the [tire
theranee of all good ends in the
college.

l’rcs. Gates responded brieﬂy.
laying special stress on the quality
of the athletics which the gymnas
sillm was expected to help along.
He also announced the name of
the new physical director, Mr. W,
S. Davis.

Congratulations from the worn.
en oi the college were gracefully

 

presented by Miss Richards, fol»
lowing which the audience joined
heartily in singing the class hymn,
written {or the occasion by Mr.
W. S, l’lcrce.

Mr. \V. S. Lyman, president of
the Athletic Union of the college,
was the next speaker, He SX'
pr ed the hope that the spirit
which had animated the athletes
in the old gymnasium, might be
extended to the new one.

The last spcakcr ot the day was
Dr. E. W. Clark, chairman of the
building committee of thetrustees,
\vho laid stress on the value of the
gymnasium as a medium through
which to obtain necessary CXCF
cise.

Mr. W. II. Dennison. president
of the class of '99, then satisﬁed
himself by artistic glances, that
the stone was well placed. and pro-
claimed the fact to an expectant
audience, which closed the Ceres
monics. The stone contained vac
rious articles of college interest,
strch as pictures of the various
athletic teams of the senior class
and ot the college, copies of the
ﬁrst and lost catalogues of the
college, and oi the presrdcnt'slast
report. programs of the scmircenr -
Icnllial celebration. and the last
issues of the college publications.

Promenade Concert.

Immediately iollowing the
Alumni address Tuesday evening,
the Glee Club gave a promenade
concert on the campus. This con-
cert lras become one of the reg.
ulal events on the commence-
ment program, and has proven a
very pleasant and popular one,

The club stood on Blair Hall
steps. while the audience was
seated on the campus or prome-
naded, as they saw ﬁt.

Tile ﬁrst number was “Dixie,”
and it recallcd to the want grad-
uates and students, the Home
Concerts of their college days.

Then followed many old favor-
ites, mingled with some of the
songs of this season's repertoire,
All were glad to hear “Rags" and
regretted that but one verse of
“Our College is Our Castle” was
sung.

During , the evening, Miss
Harriet Case, '97, sang ”Annie
Laurie," wrth Glee Club obligate.
and received an enthusiastic en-
core. It added a very pleasant
touch to the evening and was
greatly enjoyed.

The ”Faculty Song" was given
by special rcqucst, attci which
“Scarlet and Black" and “The
Lord is My Shepherd” closed the
pregnant.

it was the unanimous opinion
ot all who were present, that the
promenade concert was again a
success and rnrrst bc a permanent
feature of commencement week,
