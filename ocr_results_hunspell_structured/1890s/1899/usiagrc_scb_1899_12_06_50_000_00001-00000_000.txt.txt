Grlnnell, 12; Nebraska, 0.

Grinnell closed its football seas
on on last Thursday by shutting
out the University of Nebraska
team at Omaha. The grounds
were in a wretched condition, and
the depth and adhesiveness of the
Nebraska mud prevented airy very
scientiﬁc exhibition of football on
the palt of either team, but Grin-
nell clearly had all the best of the
playing and won without great
difﬁculty. Both teams depended
chieﬂy upon liliesbucking to ad»
vancc the ball, although Lindsay.
Douglass and Lyman made good
gains around the ends for Grins
nell. The wet and slippery bail
made kicking diFﬁcult, but in this
department also Giirrneil proved
to have the advantage and BLHCI
outspunted Benedict at almost
every exchange \thcelel did
not attempt any drop-kicks, but
Benedict made thlee trials f0i
goal trom place~kicks, but failed
cveiy time.

There were low spectacular
plays, Fiske's rrin oi 25 yards for
atouchsdown on a caught punt
probably being the feature of tile
game. The Grinnell has played
ﬁne ball. and otten stopped the
Nebraska lunners in their tlacks
At no time was Nebraska able to
gain when gains meant anything.
Wheeler’s work in the line was as
pecialiy noticeable. For Nebras-
ka, Benedict played the best
game, but was hampered by the
bad roads. Pearse made good
gains in the second trait.

Notwithstandingthe strongwind
and driving rain which kept away

about 700 witnessed the Contest.,

Those students who heard Rev
Jas H. Pettee on Sunday after»
noon had the opportunityof hear-
and interesting
comment on Japanese lite and
progress. Mr. Pettec is athnr-
oughly wrdcawake man, who has

ing instructive

a keen and appreciative insight
into tlle life and need.» of the
newly attakened people or the
orient.

He has strong, earnest convics
tions that the great need ofthe
new Japan is the vital, formative
influence of christian truth. The
great religions of the orient have
had their trial but have failed, and
today as the little natinn pulsates
with new and vigorouslirc—reach
