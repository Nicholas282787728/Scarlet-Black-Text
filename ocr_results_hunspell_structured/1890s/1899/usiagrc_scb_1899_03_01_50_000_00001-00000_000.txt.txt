Aside from thesmall attendance
at the society which was caused
by outside attractions. the Insti-
tute had a very enjoyable pro
gram Saturday night. The absent
members. especially those who
were to be on the program. cannot
be too strongly criticised for their
lack of interest iii their society's
work. The members on the pro
gram all being absent an extem»
peraneous program was drawn up
and presented. The ﬁrst number
was a song by Mr. Campbell who
kindly responded to an encore,
Halsey gave a talk on China and
her relations to Russia and the
trans»Siberian railway.

Pres. Davis gave ashoit talk on
society work and how to improve
it.

The greatest intercst and pleas-
ure of the evening centered in the
debate which lasted over an hour
and was easily the liveliest debate
