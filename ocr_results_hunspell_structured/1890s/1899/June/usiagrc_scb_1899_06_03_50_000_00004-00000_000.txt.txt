pressivcly ot the spirit of friend»
Iiness and happiness which should
exist among the society members.

Miss Cadwell sang a beatltllul
vocal 5010. after which the class
prophecy was given by Miss Ora
Graham. Considering the difﬁ
culty of writing an original class
prophecy, Miss Graham did very
well,

Miss Ethel Graham played a
guitar solo. “The Battle of Sebasr
topol“. which was heard with diﬂ‘r
culty on aecountot the violence
oi the storm outside. but appreci-
ated by the audience. The pro
gram was not delayed but its en.
joymcnt was somewhat lessened
by the terrible wind.

As is the usual custom. some
ﬁtting and uselul gilt was bestow
cd upon each senior as a token ot
the appreciation ot the society tor
the work they have done. The
presentation was made by Edna
Braley. and most of the gifts were
remarkably approprialeand greet-
ed by much applause.

The sergeantratrarms escorted
to the chair the new president.

rendered with real sympathy and
expression. Miss I'lal'l'imall intern
pl'eled C/lmtlilmdt": serenade es-
pecially well.

Miss Miller was in excellent
voice, and all of her selections
