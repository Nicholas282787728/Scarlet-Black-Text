THE MEN who are engaged in
solititing the money needed for
tlte furnishing and equipment of
the Men‘s Gymnasium are not
meeting ivitli the that
they should. The aititiiin't “CO
essary is 52500, and they have see
cured 51500 only. The students
and their friends should raise this
money for apparatus the
college will have to lurnish the
money necessary to complete the
building. Owing to the rise in
price of building material, the
amount raised for tlte building is
short nearly $4000. The con-
tracts. however. with exception oi
_ plumbing and steam pipes. have
all been let. Until the money is
secured for this equipment. the
building will be closed, as it has
been decided not to open it with
insumcient equipment. While
the men of the institution are to
be the direct gainers from the new
gymnasium, nevertheless, the
women should be interested in it
and especially so when it is re
membercd that their building was
a present to them. Willi the
money subscribed tor the ap
paretus, tltere will be brighter
prospects of the building being
completed by the tall term.

State Meet.
iContinuea 1mm post Page.)

S. U. I. has a sure thing in the
distance runs, but there is every
indication that the grand contest
of the day will be between Brown,
Fuller and Snyder in the quarter
mile event. The s. U. 1. man ape
parently has the better of the ar-
gument, but will certainly be forc-
ed close to 52seconds. The high
jump is regarded an easy thing tor
Louis, of S. U. I,, while Chase will
probably be the winner in the shotv
put. Drake counts upon the two
bicycle races, the running broad
and hop, step and jnmp,thc harn-
mer throw and the pole vault. She
is believed, however. to be weak
on second and third places. Sure
prise will or course be in order
from the smaller schools. but the
above summarizes the situation so
far as it is known,

There can, however, he no doubt
that the score will be very close,
Grinnell at best can only hope to
win by avcry narrow margin She
needs all the enthusiasm your
presence and lungs can lend. will
you be there?

The following are Gt innell's ens
tries for the meet:

Notwithstanding the inclemen-
cy oi the weather, a large number
of students and friends ol the Y.
