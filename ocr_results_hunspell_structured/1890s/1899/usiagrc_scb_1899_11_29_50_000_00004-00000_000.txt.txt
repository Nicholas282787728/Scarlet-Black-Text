At 8:45 this morning, the foot
ball team left for Omaha, u-lleie
they will play the Univetsity ot
Nebraska on Tllanksglvmg day.
The lollowing men were taken:
Capt. Burd. Lindsay, Knapp,
Fiske, Lyman, Fellows, Capron,
Wheeler, Tllicl, Tait, Douglass,
Foster, Boyle, Zieglerand Baggs.

It is almost impossible to make
piedictions as to the outcome oi
the game. Nebraska began the
season with a teani composed en-
tirely of new men, met Ames be-
fore they had fairly got together,
and were defeated by the over»
whelming score of 33 to 0. Since
that time they have been consid-
erably strengthened by the return
of several ot their old players and
while losing a majority at their
games have still played in consist»
ently improving form throughout
the season. They have been beatr
en by Kansas, Missouri, South
Dakota and Iowa, but won from
Drake by the close score of 12 to
o. It we can form anyjudgement
trom comparative scores, we will
win the game, but experience has
shown that no dependence can he
placed on such reckoning. The
result of the game depends in a
large measure on whether Nehras

 

kahas continued to improve dtii-
ing the balance of the season.

The Nebraskans will be able to
equal, if not to surpass Grinncll in
thekickingdcpartmcnt. Benedict,
their star, half-back, has acquired
an Envmble repllttlllull on account
of his ability to make placerklclt's.
1n the recent game with Kansas
he scored four goals to. his team;
the only points that were able to
score.

The Grinneil learn is in excelr
lent physical condition as is usual
this season, and in last Friday‘s
game against the strong Penn col-
lege team displayed the best {mm
which they have shown this year.
There was little tumbling, and the
interference on and runs formed
quickly, and frequently took the
runner around tor long gains,
Wheeler is showing good torm in
his drop-kicking.

We do not desire to state dog-
matically that we will win toanon
row, but feel that we are justiﬁed
in stating that we have at least a
ﬁghting chance to close the seas
on with a victory.

The second eleven has received
a Thanksgiving Day game with
the Boone town team. This team
is made up or such players as
“Dad” Walker, at State Universir
ty tame, and Art Crary, captain
of the Grinneil team in '95; but
we have no doubt that the “scrubs”
with their superior training. will
make a good showing against
their heavier opponents.
