THE JUMOR Annual Board has
decided to produce a play tor
their annual. The classes ot ’96
and ’97 both produced plays
which were decidedly successtul
and it these are fair representar
tions at class theatricals the stu-
dents ot I. C. can well be pleased
that they are to witness another

. this year. The juniors have ex
celleilt talent in their class so that
with the spirit and interest that is
being shown in the play we may
be conﬁdent of a ﬁrst class entelr
tainment. While abook like most
of the Grinnell annuals is better
in that books retain their interest,
and may be enjoyed by others
than those who can be in Grinllell
at the time they are issued, still
we think the production oi a play
one ot the very best iorms in
which an annual can be given.
The popularity of former plays
given as annuals strongly supports
this statement and we should
count ourselves tortunate that we
are to be here this year when a
play is to be given tor we can en.
joy an annualvin book form in
other years when we may not be
here, The choice of the play by
the junior class is very well made.
The Odyssey has only lately been
dramatized so that it is a novelty
on the stage while its historic and
literary worth cannot be tarnished
by its age. It. will be both enter-
taining and instructive and well
worth the work put upon it.

THE CLASS of loci) on Monday
evening decided a somewhat vex-
ed question by passing a motion
to wear caps and gowns as the
class uniforms. This question
occasioned considerable debate.
and was only decided after full
discussion pro and con. Itseenis
that on the whole, the class has
acted wisely. It is advisable that
some uniform should be adopted
and caps and gowns are without
doubt the most desirable uni-
to'rrn, it a certain prejudice against
their use can be removed. The
classes at ’93 and ’98 have been
the only ones to adopt this
costume but there seems to
be no reason why it should not be
made the permanent insignia
of the senior class. Alter the
novelty of caps and gowns has
worn off, there is no doubt that
they will be accepted as suitable
and becoming. Their use in the

east is accepted as a matter of
course, and there is no reason why
the same should not be true here.
It is hoped that‘ none ot the class
may hang back, now that the ac
tion is ﬁnally taken. The cost of
the Caps and gowns is only slight,
and no one need he listened from
buying them on that ground. To
be effective, this uniform should
be accepted by the class as a
whole; not by apait merely. The
class, so far in its history, has
been a united body, and it is very
desirable that it shall not divide
over so small a matter as this.

ONE'S ATTENTION is constantly
called to the fact that in nearly
every small institution some
phases of college life and work
are given greater prominence than
others. In one college oratory
and debating may be at a plemi-
um, and social life may talre up
more than ajust proportion of the
students' time, while in another
institution athletics may hold the
chief place in the interests of col~
lege circles, and the other sides
of student life be neglected. Ev-
elyone will admit that the whole
value of a collegiate course can
not be gotten from books or from
any one phase or college life, and
yet think that they can obtain
more good by spending most ol
then-time along one in two lilies
than by letting their interests be
taken up by every innovation ihai
comes along. Grinnell is oltell
criticised as givmg too
prominence to one or two sides ul
college life. and yet we think that
to this very tact is due a large
part of her strength.
