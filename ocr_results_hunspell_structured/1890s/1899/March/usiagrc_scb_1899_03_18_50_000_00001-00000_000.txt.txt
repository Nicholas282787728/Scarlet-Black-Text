Cornell Wins.

The third annual debate be
tween Cornell and Iowa College
was held last night at the opera

‘ house, under the most favorable
auspices, and again our Methodist
brethren proved their superiority,
to the satisfaction of two out of
three expert judges of economic
and political discussion. Cornell
took advantage of the close of her
winter term to send a delegation
of over a hundred by special train
to cheer her representatives.
Grinnell tor once woke up to the
importance of the occasion and
packed the hall with enthusiastic
supporters of the home team. It
was atypical college crowd, and
the atmosphere was electric with
intense interest,

President Gates, who presided
with his usual felicrty, announced
two introductory musical numbers.
a pleasing selection by the Cor-
nell Mandolin Club. and a vocal
solo by Miss Prevost, Schumann's
"Die beiden Grenadiere," render-
ed with excellent effect. The
time-keeper, Mr. Schivietert of
Cornell, read tlte rules governing
the debate and then the contest
was on. The question read:" Grantr
cd that a uniform monetary sys
tem for the entire world is desira-
ble: RISOZZIId, That this object is
best attained by gold riionoiriciii
lism." Cornell was represented on
theaﬂirmative by Messrs F. A
Heald, A. M. Jayne and Geo. H.
Belts; lowa College on the nega
live by D. R. Douglass, w. H.
Dennison and F. M. Roberts.
Thejudges were Proiessor I. A.
Loos and Dr. B. F. Sliambaugh
or our State University, and Dr.
H. R. Hatﬁeld of tlteUliiversity of
Chicago.

Mr. Heald opened tor the
afﬁrmative with the contention
that national monometallism has
thus far been brought about by a
natural evolution, the less elﬁcient
metal yielding to the more eff-is
cicnt. by economic laws, money
has steadily changed iroiii the
cheaper and more bulky to the
dearer and more transportable.
With the trade demand for a bet—
ter medium than silver, gold ac
quired a more stable value. Fi~
nally, credit instruments have
largely displaced gold. Gold
monometallism does not contemr

 

plate a circulating medium of
gold alone; credit instruments and
subsidiary coinage not excluded,
The gold standard to be adopted
by silver nations as soon as prac-
ticabIe—the gold standard nations
to keep up ircc coinage ot- gold.
An efﬁcient banking system cone
templated, with free use of credit
instruments. The supply oi gold
is ampleithe $2,ooo,ooo,ooo yct
needed to put the world on a gold
basis can be provided in seven
years. By the extension of the
banking system, a diminution or
the amount or gold required is in
prospect.

Mr. Douglass opened tor the
negative with a discussion of the
intent of the question. Indeﬁnite
time not contemplated, nor unis
formity in the abstract, but con-
crete application now. A world
gold standard must be proven
possible. desirable. and even most
desirable. The negative would
prove a universal gold standard
impossible, undesirable it possi~
blc. not most desirable in any
case. The gold standard not gold
monometallisni; for this, gold
must be sole legal tender, alone
irccly coined, and all other money
redeemable in it. Only England
noiv has gold inonometaliism;
others have the gold standard, but
a large indepenent silver circular
lion. India and China, with half
tlle population of the world, an
insurmountable obstacle to unie
vcrsal gold rliouometaliismitheir
conservatism arid ﬁxity. and apper
tite for silver. Impossible to re-
place existing Silver and brass
currency with gold except at
ruinous cost—China has failed to
circulate even silver, though kept
at bullion value.

Mr. Jayne tor the afﬁrmative
began with counter deﬁnition of
terms. then divided the burden oi
proof between the two sides—the
afﬁrmative to prove the gold sys-

tem politically possible, econo-
mically practicable. and superior
to any other system; the negative
to prove another system political-
ly possible, economically practi-
cable, and as good as gold monoe
metallism. The gold standard
easily attained, in accord with the
demands of the business wolrd, as

gold is most stable and supports

 

ten-i, and would require the least
change—«change in but six unim~
portant sections of the world,
some otwliich are already in trans-
ition. Any other system would
require international agreement.
The gold standard already com-
ing in through economic torccs.
through self-interest. Interna-
tional agreement has been proven
to be impossible. The adoption
of bimetallism would cause a ter
rible ﬁnancial crash.

Mr. Dennison for the negative
objected that the afﬁrmative as-
sumed the possibility of a world
gold standard, which Mr. Gosciicn
called "Utopian, and a ialse utoe
pia.” Relation of prices and
money. Falling pricescauscd by

Mr. Belts made the ﬁnal argu»

prices. No hardship to debte

the most satisfactory credit sys- i tion of gold, as of silver.

 

Mr. Roberts closed tor the neg-
tive. Tivo systems can be sup-
ported in opposition to gold mon-
omctalllsm: universal bimetallism
—which would insure a broader
basis, with more money in the
hands ot the people, and could
be lnore easily attained. as half
the world is now on a silver basis;
or silver rnonometallism. Silver
more regular in supply than gold.
which depends largely on now

ot silver is more responsive to de-
mand; silver has followed far
more nearly the average price line
of standard commodities. Only
its bulk an objectionibut actual
transportation of coin in trade is
inﬁnitesimal; the large use of
credit devices removes this objec-
tion. Silver monoinetallism so-
cially possible; the western world
could more easily adapt itsoli
than the eastern. England alone
stood in the way ot international .
bimetallisnt. France nearly sucl
ceeded in maintaining the purity
oi the metals alone. ‘

Mr. Roberts continued in ie-
bultal (or the negative, and Mr.
Betts ended the debate in rebutr
tal for the aﬁﬁrniative. The Glee
Club sang two selections while
the judges were making up their
decision, which Dr. Shambaugh
announced astivo to one in favor
of the afﬁrmative.
