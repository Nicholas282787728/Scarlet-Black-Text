THE \iAss me:llng held Mundai
afternoon seems to have accom
plished in part the desired result.
It is certain that a spirit of inter-
est has been awakened in the com»
ing debate which has been dore
mant before, but there is more re-
quired than rnlcre enthusiasm on
thepartotthestudents. Although
the seats (or the debate have been
on sale since Saturday. the ntrnr
her which have already been tar
served is triﬂing in comparison
with the number of students who
should attend Friday night. A
special train lrom Cornell will
bring over one hundred students
from that institution, and it will be
a lasting disglace to the college ii
there are not‘iour times that nllmr
ber of Grinnell students present.

AT THE last meeting of the fac-
ulty a new regulation in regard to
examinations was adopted, which
on the whale seems in be a very
judicious one, Her-carter there
will be no legltlar semester-exam
