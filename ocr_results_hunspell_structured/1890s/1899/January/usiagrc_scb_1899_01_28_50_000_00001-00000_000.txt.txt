Those in this country who are
working as 'best they nray to die
vorce municipal administration
from national partisan politics
may talie encouragement frorn
London's experience, as stated by
Mr. J. W. Martin of tltat city. Mr.
Martin is no“ ilt New Yorll, where
he is to give a course of three lecte
ures on this general subject. The
ﬁrst was delivered on Friday eves
ning, and in it he practically stuite
ed his description with the report
ot the commission ot 183$ to
examine into municipal attaii-s.
They were shown to be in a shock
ing condition. as Mr. Martin says.
“in as corrupt a state as it was pose
siblc for them to get." It was in
fact analagous to that of New
York under the Tweed regime.
Titus one of the illustrations of the
conditions iound to exist‘is that
town councilors were found to be
borrowing money and dividing it
among tliemselves,and another rs
that of a corporate school in which
there was only one pupil. but two
masters. each receiving a salary oi
53,500 a year. The cause of the
corruption was found in the pore
version of municipal privileges to
political objects.

From this pointdatedthechatige
which has made English munici-
pal administration bctterand more
economical. It is not porter ,bui
there is pretty general agreement

 

that there is comparatively little
opportunity for profe sional poli»
tictaris of the lower kind, Mem-
bers of the cotrricil are elected
without regard to wards, and. ac-
cording to Mr. Martin, with little
regard iosocial or political stand
ing, provided the ntan is honest,
faithful and competent. This
makes it comparatively easy to
continue good men in ofﬁce, and
we are told that as a rule they are
reelected. Members of the coune
cil serve gratuitously, and are not
suspected of making money out
ot their places. It is sale to as»
sume that the charge would be
made promptly enough if any
ground ior- it were discover-ed.

Of the crvrl servrce systcm in its
relation to these satisfactory cone
dltions. Mr. Martin said: "Our
prdgre.. depends in a great nteas»
tire on the civil servrce. All the
elupln know that they hold
their positions ior good beita’vior
and good service, and promorron
depends on efﬁciency. They enter
the service fully aware that it is to
be lheit life's work if they are
worthy. The employe's livelihood
does not depend upon political
turns.” Anti to show that this is
not mere generalization, he told
(if a case it! \tlilch a school teacher
wlto wanted a place as principal
offered the couilcilors a part of
his salary it he were elected. In
America. the otter might have
been rejected, bttt probably there
would have been to
punish the man publicly. But
what happened totltrs man in Eng-
land ivas that lie was promptly
dismissed from the service. The
substance of itall is that England
has made a more thorough appli—
cation of the tnerrt system than
we have, and obtains better results
local administration for that
reason alone.
