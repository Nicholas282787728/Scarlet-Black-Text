IT is often interesting to note
the impressions which the college
and students leave upon the visit-
ors who spend a ieiv days in our
midst. College life oftentimes
leaves the impression trpon otit-
siders that it is .i lite ot gaiely in-
termingled wrth a little hard \\’orl(,
but almost entirely lacking in seri-
We think that this optnr
ion, although it may be the com
mon one. is incorrect, and it
with pleasure that we quote front
a letter from Mrs Florence I<e1~
ley. who in ivi iiig trom Hull
House of lter visit to Grinncll.
says: “Everything connected
with my visit tvas a source of in
spiration, and I look back to it
with delight. I had no Ieallzing
sense that there remained, in our
rapidly corrupting college-world,
a college with the atmosphere of
seriousness that informs and sur~

rounds Iowa College."

Commencement week is the Hyde
Prize contest in oratory, for mem~
bers of the three lower classes of
the college. During the last two
or three years these contests have
aroused a great deal of interest,
and the orations presented have
usually beenrioi a high order.
This ought to be true in the future
as well. The preliminary contest
to decide the Final speakers will
be held toward the last of the
winter term, and SCARLET AND
BLACK desires to give ample no.
tice to those who intend to enter.
It is to be hoped that interest in
this line may not be permitted to
flag. So much has been said in
these columtis on the subject of
oratory, that we do not feel it
necessary to speak further. The
importance of oralorical wort.- is
recognized by everyone. ltonly
remains for us to put the same
spirit into this as into other de-

partmentsotouieollegelitc. Tire
rlydc Prize contest affords excel
lent opportunity for Freshmen, as
well as upper classmen, to acquire
experience in this line. and is vale
uable on this account. Any-one
will be proﬁted in taking part in
it, and we hope that this year‘s
contest may not be lacking either
in iitiiiiher of speakers or iii qtiril.

Will Carleton.

Iowa College students are to en-
joy another rEll'E literary treat this
next Friday evening by heniiiig
one of our most well»klio\vn Amer-
ican poets in selections from his
own Works. Few writers appeal
so directly to the minds and hearts
oi men to inspire them to trtier
living Many of his poems are or
such unusual merit that any one
of them would have been sufﬁcient
in themselves to make him fanrous.
It is always a great gain to hear a
writer interpret his own poems.
Will Carleton is pronounced an
entertainer in every sense at the
word and his poems are admirably
adapted to the platform], No one
can lienr him tor a single evening
without gaining new intercst and
seeing new truth and beauty .n his
works. The Y. M. C. A. is to be
congratulated on Securing such a
man,»and when his entertainment
is offered in a course of other numr
bers or equally high grade, it sure-
ly deserves the patronage or the
entire student body. The lecture
course is not intended to be a
source of revenue to any individ
ual or organization, but it is not
only desirable but necessary that
the course he selirstlpporling. li
we want to hear the best men we
must be willing to give our liberal
support to them when they come.
It is with great pleasure that we
learn that the high grade enterr
tainments of this season have been
so well patronized that they have
not been a ﬁnancial loss to any
organization. for it means a still
higher grade of entertainments
{or the future.
