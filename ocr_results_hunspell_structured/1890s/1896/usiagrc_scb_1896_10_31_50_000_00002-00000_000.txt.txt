than the last year‘sia very grati—
fying fact, since it was expected
that there would be a noticeable
decrease on account of the pres-
ent ﬁnancial stringency. The
sophomore class unusually
small, but the freshman class off-

being almost double last year's
.[résl‘lman registry. Many of last
year's graduating class show their
appreciation of their alma niater‘s
advantages, by enrolling for gladr
uate work. All irl all the friends
of the college may ﬁnd ground
for sincere pleasure in the outlook
for the year’s Well: as numerically
indicated. and the spirit in which
this work has been taken up adds

, amply to this promise.
