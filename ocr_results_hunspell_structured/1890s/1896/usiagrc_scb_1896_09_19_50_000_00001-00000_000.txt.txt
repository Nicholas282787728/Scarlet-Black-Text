the season or '95. Tire article on
the Alermcrica Team for r595.
by Caspar W. Whitney in Hat'-
[rz'r'x I/VM/r'ly, is included, and there
are a number of letters from phys»
reians, clergymen and retired vct-
erans or tllc gritllrnn bearing test
timony to the good to be derived
front active participation in the
sport.

There is but one set of rules
thisyear. The chiel ehangcseon
com the fair catch and scrimmage.
The old rule of hcclitlg a catch is
resumed with the retention ol the
titteerryard penalty. Ma s and
momentum plays are legislated
against in two ways. No player
may take more than a single step
betore the ball is put in play, save
one mart who may be in motion
toward his own goal, and ﬁve men
or more are folbiddetl to bunch
insidethetackles, Othercltanges
affect the putting of the ball into
play and the kicks are deﬁned
more closely.

The recognition given to wes
ern football and to Grinncll ill
particular is gratifying.

It has been the custom tn prc-
vions years to conﬁne all mention
in the football guides to eastern
schools or at best to include one
or two large western universities.
The past season as never before
western colleges forced the east
to recognize their prowess in route
ball and consequently in this
