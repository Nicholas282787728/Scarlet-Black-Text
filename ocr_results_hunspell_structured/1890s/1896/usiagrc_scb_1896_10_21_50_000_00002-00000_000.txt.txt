THE PERMANENT organization of
the publishing board has been efv
Eectecl, Hereafter the semi-week
ly publication will be known as
SCARLET AND BLACK and the
monthly as THE UNIT, The ﬁrst
number of the new series of THE
UNIT is in press and will appear
the latter part of the week,

We DESIRE to call the attention
of all men interested in the font
ball teani. either as players or oili-
erwise. to the article published in
another column concerning the
practice of the team during the
past few days. The situation
indeed serious, and calls f0i united
action on the part of all those in-
tercsted. No censure can be too
severe for men who, just becaiise
of the absence of one in authority.
fail to yield obedience to one ap-
pointed in his place.
