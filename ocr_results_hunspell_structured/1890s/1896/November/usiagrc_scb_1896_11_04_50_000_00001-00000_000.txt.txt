Grinnell Institute.

Brown gave as the ﬁrst number-
of the program. a reading of two
of Eugene Freld's poems. "Good
bye. God Bless You" and “Apple
Pie and Cheese.” They were give
en in a characteristically happy
way and were tavorably received.

Sargent presented a paper on
“Tenement Reform." which
evinced caretul study and was
highly instructive as ivell as inter
esting.

Marsh set forth the purpose. or—
ganization and merits of the soci-
ety. “Patriots of America."

Hart appeared with a caretully
prepared paper on "Washington
and the Constitution."

On account of the absence of
some ot the regular debaters who
had gone home for election, the
debate was postponed and the
extemporaneous work was given
additional time.

spaulding and McCreary spoke
entertainingly on “Hallowe'en”
and “Nikola Tesla." respectively.

An externporaneous discussion
by Armstrong and Bean followed.
the question being "Should the
name or Iowa College be changed
to Grinnell College?" The nler-
its of both sides of the case were
well set forth.

Lyman spoke on "The Signiﬁ-
cance ot Flag Day" and Richard—
son gave an extemporaneous
character sketch of EXrSenator
George w. Jones.

McLarenand Mcllose discussed
the question. “Is the use of money
in a political campaign to the ex-
tent it has been used in the pres
ent one beneﬁcial orjllstiﬁable?"

A number at Calocas added to
the pleasure ot the evening by
their presence and their (elicitous
expression otCalocagathia'sgreet.
ings to the Institute.

 

Chrestomathran.

The hall was the scene of a gen-
eral political rally last Saturday
evening, In accordance with the
wording ot the program. some
noted speakers appeared (at least
noted witltin the ranks of said so
crety).

GraVEs opened with a speech
grving his reasons iorbeing a gold
republican. Lrncolrr read a set
speech favoring the prohibitionist
platform. repi esentiria that money
was not it leading I he in this
campaign. Smith again present-
ed MCKinley's clalnis with a
slightly different set of arguments
from that of the ﬁrst speaker.
Crabbe was the only representa
tive for Bryan and the tree silver
cause.

Leonard made a short speech
presenting the civil service phase
of the campaign.

At the close of the program an
informal vote was taken to ascer-
tain the political complexron of
the audience.

The speeches in general. with
the exception of the last one mene
tioned. were only a summary, and
a very uninteresting one. of much
that has been already said in the
campaign. VeryIittlethoughtwas
represented in the major part of
the statements.

The nature of the program ole
(cred a ﬁeld for sortie original in-
vestigution and for real sympathy
in presentation of arguments. but
in both these respects the speakr
ers were at fault. Through the
efforts of the music committee.
some good mustc was presented.
the one redeeming feature of the
program.

Clark Spencer Entertains.

Saturday evening was spent by
a large number of students. in
company with other young people
of the town. at the spacious home
ol M- and Mrs. H. C. Spencer on
Main‘St Fortune-telling. roastr
ing chestnuts. and other games
more especially characteristic at
Halloween. were indulged in till a
late hour. when the party closed
with a gootl oltl fashioned Virginia
reel. Few people are by nature
such royal entertainers as Mr. and
Mr . Spencer. hence the delight
with which their invitations are
always hailed.

 

Course in Petrology.

l’resitlent Gates called together
the members of the senior class
Friday atternoon and outlined a
course in Prison Reform and Phil-
osophy ot Religion. which he in
tends to present to them during
the coming weeks. It is the in
tention ot the President to devote
about twenty weeks to the course
entire. halfofthe time being given
to the work in Prison Reform and
the other half to the cotirse in
Philosophy or Religion. This is
certainly a course to be encour-
aged. As a rule the students of
the college meet the President ale
together too untrequently in the
class room, and especially along
thisline. in which PresidentGates
is undoubted authority. tl‘leirmeetr
ing together cannot fail to be at
beneﬁt.

Rates to Des Moines.

Negotiations with the Rock Isl-
and early in the week tailed to se-
cure a reasonable rate to Des
Moines [or the Ames game. Sat-
urday. but later reports indicate
that a good rate will. after all. be
secured. It is the intention of the
Republicans ot Des Moines to
hold a monster ratiﬁcation meet
ing there Saturday night. and low
rates will be given on all railroads.
We are not in position to give the
exact amount. but it will he an
notinced later. This furnishes
an opportunity of attending the
game. which the students shorrld
not be slow to avail themselves of.

Tennis Doings.

The past week has not seen such
activity on the tennis courts as the
preceding weeks ot this term.
This is not due to any lack ol in-
terest in the game. btrt the cold
weather which has been with us
of late renders its enjoyment less
keen, The Tennis Association of
the college is now well equipped.
possessing 2t dozen well graded
courts. provided with seven—foot
back-nets. and is in as prosperous
ﬁnancial condition as any organs
izatioll in the college.

The students of Harvard Uni»
versity recently united in a Mc-
Kinley parade Frttcen hundred
of them were in the column. The
sentiment there was overwhelm-

ingly tor gold.
