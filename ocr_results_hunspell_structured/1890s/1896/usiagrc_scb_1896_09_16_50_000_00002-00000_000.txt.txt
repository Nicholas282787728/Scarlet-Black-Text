Dr. Frisbie’s Address.

Instead of opening the college
year with the usual chapel cxer»
cises as formerly. President Gates:
this year departed from the regu-
lar custom and invited Dr. Fris-
bie. pastor ot Plymouth Congre-
gational Church. Des Moincs. to
address the students. Dr. Frisbie
spoke for three-quarters of an
houi and was heaid with close at
tention by the students,

His address was full of thoughts
of great interest both to the old
and new students. Especially
was it interesting to the old ones.
many ot whom have had almost
the identical experience described
by Dr Frisbie. namely. thc chang-
ing ot old -nd supposedly deepr
rooted opinions attcr a year or
more of college lite.

The speakct drew his lesson
irom the falling leaves. so plentis
(ul at this season ot thc year. To
thus: he compared the ideas and
opinions with which a student
comes to college but which fall
fiom him as he gradually draws
new views and inspirations irom
college,

1).. Frisbie concludcd by urg-
iiig his hearers to look torwarti to
the spring, the time when these
new ideas in“ be developed and
wili blossom forth to bear fruit.

l President Gates plan of open-
iing the college year in this inan-
inoi is certainly a conimendablc
one, and it is to be hoped that he
will continue it

yeais.
