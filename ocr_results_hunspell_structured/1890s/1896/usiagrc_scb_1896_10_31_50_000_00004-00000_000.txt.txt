To Register Amateur Athletes.

The president of tile Amateur
Athletic Union proposes a scheme
[or the registration of amateur
athletes, which will doubtless be
brought forward for adoption at
the annual meeting. The plan is
tieVised to protect the athletes,
and to prevent the acceptance by
athletic clubs of entries lrom
“ringers,”

A registration bureau would be
organized in the A. A. U.. whrch

it would cllnlge a nominal sum tor

registration, and in rettlrlr issue
a card, drrly numbererl in a series
of rotation, afﬁrming the amateur
standing. Handicappers and as
Sociatlon would be
provided with lists, and would be
able to detect any entry of whreir
the name and number did not
correspond to the one on the list.
Tile new scheme has been favora-
bly I'ecci\'etl.antl stands a good
chance oi lreing adopted at the
meeting, November l6tlr.

The results of to-day'smeetings
on the glidilon will be watched

‘ with a great deal of interest as they

will afield some criterion for com-
parisenoi the teams which will
soon be the prrncipals in the big
matches,

Ill the cast Cornell and Prince
ton meet on the latter's grounds,
and this game lvlll furnish a
good chance to get a line on the
relative strength of the Harvard
and Princeton teams, Harvard
having dcreatcd Cornell at Ithaca
last Saturday by a score at 13 to 6.

Harvard will line up against the
Carlisle Indians who lairly played
Yale to a standstill la~t Saturday,
being robbed of a touchdown by
Referee Hickok, the ex-Yale
playel. With Captain Wright-
inglon laid up tor the rest or the
season and Cabot and Haughton
out oi the game Harvard rs in
danger of defeat by the red men.
