GrinnclL “'(Hlueﬁllny, June at nan:

THE PRESENT week of examina-
tions is popularly supposed to
mark the inauguration among the
students of the “honor system,”
yet there is no apparent change
in the course of things as yet,
There has been no departure troin
the old taculty supervrsion,to inc
timate that the students alone ate
held responsible tor the conduct
of the examinations. We do not
suspect nor mean to intimate that
the presence of the instructor dur»
ing the examination arises from
suspicion, still if the Princeton
system is to be tried, its trial
should be thorough, in order that
the question of its continuance or
rejection may speedily he settled
It we are to have an honor system,
the student supervision should be
unqualiﬁed, in order that the test
may be fair and convincing.

The Course Was Correct.

A report of the State Field Day
in one of the Chicago papers
stated that the course for the two
hundred and tweniy yard dash in
Des Moines was twenty yards
short and explained the fast time
given in this ivay. Last Friday's
Ragiirzrsays that the course has
been remeasul‘ed and found cor-
rectto the inch. It was laid out
by acornpeteiit civil engineer of
Des Moines and its correctness
having been attested there is no
course lctt but to accept Rush's
time as the state record, Grin-
nell now holds all the track rec-
ords oitliestatc with the single
exception of the tivmiille bicycle
and of the ﬁeld events has the
broad jump record.
