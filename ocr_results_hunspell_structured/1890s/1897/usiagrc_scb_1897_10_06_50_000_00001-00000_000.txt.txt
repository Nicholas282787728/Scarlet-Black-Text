Next Saturday atternoon at 3ztio
r. .ir occurs (.‘rrinnell's ﬁrst loote
ball game oi the season The
game will be with Ellsworth Cole
lcgc of Iowa Falls whose football
team is considered to be one of
the best of the minor college
teams oi the state. They have
been coachcd this casmi by Price,
'fortncrly of Carleton, a than who
is well up in football trio-dodge,
and its he has had excellent mar
tcrial to work with. his team be
ing an exceptionally heavy one
for a small college. there can be
no doubt but that they will give
the home team a close, hard game,

The average weight ot the Ellse
worth team is 164 pounds. while
Grinnell‘s net weight wrll average
a trrﬁe under t59 pounds, son is
easy to see that the advantage so
tar as weight is concerned lies
with our visitors.

l’iice, their coach, played tulle
back for Carleton tor a number of
years and was the life and soul of
the Carleton team, He will play
tvith the Ellsworth team Satur-
day. There can be no doubt that
the visitors have been tlndel’tslls
mated to a great extent, asdl‘ieir
team is composed almost entirely
of old and tried men.

The management have placed

grounds and amphitheatre at 25c.

We have chosen l‘lctbett C.
Ward ol the class at 1890 as the
one must ﬁt in every way to have
his name permanently linked with
the field given over to recreation
and physical development. There
is no better name and example to
be constantly held before the gen

of Iowa College than that of Her»

course he was one oi our leading

and gowns on appropriate occa-
sions is last becoming ﬁxed in the
higher educational institutions of
this country. It has passed the
stage oi student tad or ecclesias-
tical requirement; it has overcome
the quite national anglophobia,
because it has been tried in our
leading centers ot higher educa-
tion. and approved by both the
msthetic and the utilitarian sense.
The academic gown, as used in
America. is really a uniform. On
its historic and picturesque side it
serves to remind those who don lt
of the continuity and dignity ol
learning. and recalls the honored
roll oi Englrslrspealting Univer
sity men. On its democratic side
it subdues the differences in dress
arising irorn the diticrenccs
taste. fashion. manners, wealth
and clothes. all with the outward
grace of equal tellotvship which
has ever been claimed as an inlict
tact in the republic oi learning.
The gown unir'orms a body ot
scholars. overcoming the nonde
script dress ot any considerable
number of men and women. On
the score of economy it saves
many a young man or woman con-
