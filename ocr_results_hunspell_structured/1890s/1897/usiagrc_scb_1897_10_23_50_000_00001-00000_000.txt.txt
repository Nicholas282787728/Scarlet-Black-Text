IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL,

 

The college directory is now out of‘
the press and students can secure cop-

ies free by calling at Secretary Rob-

bin’s oilice.

Ellis.

The numbers on yesterday’s pror
gram were the best and most interest-r
ing that have been presented so tar.

Miss Field gave a Bird’s-eye View
ot London, pointing out on a large
map, the docks, the principal streets
and the places or historical interest,
adding bits or description which saved
the talk from being a mere catalogue
ol facts.

The second chapter ot the Iristorr
ical serial was read by Miss Smith.
Bits ot mythology, Saxon traditions,
and an old battle-song were skilltully
woven in.

After an instrumental solo by Miss
Harrimarr. the Tower was described
by Miss Fox in a car'etully written
paper.

Scenes in the Tower were presented
rrrrder the direction of Miss l'yer:~
Queen Mary, the Bloody, signing the
warrant wlrrclr imprisoned Princess
Elizabeth; I—‘rrncess Elizabeth as l
oner, then as Queen. and Sir Thomas
Moore with his darrghler iust before
his execution.

Chrestomathian.

'I'lre Clucsto program of last Sate
urday was opened with a paper by
Grier on Injunction and Government
by Injunction, with some reference to
the suit of Pres. Gates.

Marsh then gave a very interesting
talk on his experienccs at Oak Beach,
New Jersey. Miss Clark their favor-
ed tnc society with a prarro solo.

Mr, Way gave a corrret solo and
responded to a hearty encore.

In the extenrpor‘aneous work Wyatt
spoke on “Methods for Improving
Society Work;” 'l‘ettier on “Survey-
or’s Experiences,” and Gardner re-
viewed the situation in the mayoralty
iir Greater New Yor

The debate, was "Rcsolved that
there should be a constitutional
amendment making marriage regula-
transnational and unitornr." In the
absence of the regular allirmativc
speakers Gardner and Wyatt sup-
ported the question. Crabb and
Douglass defended the negative. It
was shown by the atlirnrative that
owing to the lacilities ot travel only
the poorest state laws on the question

 

are of any force. The negative
pleaded a lack of public opinion to
enforce better laws. The decrsion
was given to the attirrnative.

Mass Meeting.

All students, both men and women,
are requested to meet in the chapel at
4:15, Thursday, October 28, for the
purpose of organizing ‘yellirrg squads.’

This meeting is called by the man-

agement of the football team with this‘

end in view, that something like sys-
tematic cheering may come from the
grandstand at the Ames game next
Saturday.

That will be the hardest game of
the season on the home grounds, and
the team will have to play the best
quality of football or which they are
capable. To do this they need the
moral support of feeling that they
have the synryathy of the spectators
and that their efforts are appreciated
by their fellow students. Srrclr a

feeling is created only by errtlrrrsiastiC'

cheering, and it is that which puts the
“do-or-die” spirit into the play. It
could never have come from the treat
Irrent received at the Ellsworth game
two weeks ago. Such lack of Strpr
port as the home team received train
the side lines that day is a drsgaace to
the Grinnell College student body.

Every man in the institution catr
not play on the team nor can all help
make a strong ’var'sity by playing on
the “scrub” but there is no reason
why each and everyone should not
lend that support which :comes from
hearty cheering. Not only will it
make the team play better but it will
also give the visitors a mrrch better
opinion of the college and the athletic
spirrt oi the students.

That this be done to the best ad-
vantage it is necessary that squads be
formed, each one having a leader, and
that they be stationed on either srde
of the ﬁeld and almost constant cheer-
ing be kept up; as soon as one stops,
another beginning. A large crowd
should tru rr out for the meeting, One
of the football managers will preside.

Senior Academy Party.

The class of 1902 gave their li‘
party of the year at the Cottage
evcning. The Cottage was beauti-
fully decorated \vitlr vines and leaves
and the porches were adorned with
Jack-o’—Lanterus, which gave a very
pleasing eﬁect.
