Base Ball Prospects.

The tlnlavorable weather has,
so lar, been rather discouraging
to base ball practice. but the past
woe]; has seen a good many can-
ditliHCS out wading around after
the ball. With good weather,
regular piactice will be under way
in a iew days and some idea as to
the strength oftlic team as awholc
may be estimated. Of the in»
dividtlal players there are a mum
her who give promise of develop
ing into players of the highest
Griunellstilndard. CaptainRaley
will be found on ﬁrst again this
year. Ralcy is playing his touith
year on the team and should sus-
tain his high reputation this sea-
son. He was called one of the
best ﬁeltlcrs Glinncll evel had
when he was located ill the left
garden. Last year it was neces
sary to change him to ﬁrst base
and in that position
abundantly justiﬁed the change.
His leach is phenomenal, and'his
“heady" and coaching
should make him all ideal ﬁeld
captain. His \VOlk with the stick
should be strong this year.

Davis \rlll be left to do the bulk
of the walk in the box. With
the inipiovement which may
reasonably be expected to come
with increased experience he
ought to mect all‘cxpcctati‘ons
this year. He has always been
one cl the safest batters on the
team, and his ability with'the
stick is reinalltable for a plIChCl'.

his “oil:

\\‘ol 1:

Sargent Will be seen at his old
place at second and it he starts in
at the clip “ill! which he closed
last season, his work nill be all
that could be asltcd. His batting
at the end of last year was such as
to put him at the top of the list.

Coggesliail plays a good sale
ﬁeld and his battingihas always
been timely.

Unlcss Mollr goes behind the
but he will probably be seen in
the outﬁeld this ycai. His work
in the few games he played last

season was ﬁrst class and Iic

 

should be among the bcst batters
in the team.

Blatherwick, Morcs and Tait
are among the old men who may
be expected to make good show-
ings this season.

or the new men, Lindsay is eXr
pcctcd to ptOVC a valuable [actor
in the success of the (Cam. He
had the advantage in the Aurora
High School ol by
Somers, '94 and Darby, '95. and
may be expected to have agood
idea of Gl‘lilllell training andi
Grinnell pluck on the diamond.
He is a candidate for the inﬁeld.

Shepard has been doing some
practice preparatory to a trial in
the box, He has plenty oi speed
and good curves, and it he can ac.
quire conﬁdence in t’acinga butter,
will provea puzzle to opposing
teams. Pope has shown some
good wort- in practice, and will
make a stl'o-ig hid ior ﬁrst team
honors. Scott, Peterson, Bishop,
Beyer, Capl’on and a number of
other HL'W men the olit practicing,
and there are some dark horses in
this number who itill make some
of the old men work for their
places,

From last years team Heald.
Maser, Stl'tlble, and Norris are
missing, and their places must be
well ﬁlled betore \\C can hope tor
anlinnlng team. No man has a
sure claim on his position, and
there is eveiy inducement for all
who can play to come out and
work. There is no excuse for dis
couragement, in view of the rear
0rd made by last year's team unr
dcr far more adverse circum-
stances, and with the same spirit
which won the bat for them. we

can make a good showing,
