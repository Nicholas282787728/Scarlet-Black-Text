The‘cottage Ball.

The annual cottage ball has al»
ways been favored with such sucr
cess that it is an event looked for-
ward to with much interest by the
cottagers and those favored tew
outsiders who are so fortunate as
to be invited, The event last
Thursday evening which took the
form ofa colored cake walk and
ball was in every way up to the
standard. and those who attended
are profuse in their statements of
the charming entertainment “De
eolo’ed people of quality" tell-
dered their "honeys.” At eight
o’clock all formed in line for the
cake walk and were led by one of
the most clever and witty coons.
Mistah George Washington Dc
Coon and his charming “lulu,”
Mis Samathe Jonsing. All were
outclassed in the wall: by Mis
Clara Cordellia Clementlncjones,
the queen ot grace, who easily
ivon the cake.

At the ball which followed tllc
many elaborate and beauiiiul Cos»
tumes were shown off at a grcat
advantage. Mis Diana Yellowby
was most bewitching in a startling
gown, bodice of blue, ciit decolr
leté, exquisite chrysanthemums
and glass ornaments. The other
ladies looked very captivating in
gowns becoming the occasion,
while the “gentlemen” were very
amiable and graceful in their con
ventional dress suits (of many

At the meeting of the delegates
of the I, l. C. A .A, ill Marshall-

tion of oilc school, which was

pended for l'eltlsing‘ to turn over
to the association the bonus that
was raised from the Marshallton'n
merchants, This bonus amount-

exactly how much money they re
ccived and exactly how much they
claim and on what they base their
claims. Grinnell is anxious and
wrlling to have Ames back In the
association and upon her making
the matter right will do all in her
power to restore I. A. C. to her
lormcr position.

Freshman-Sophomore Field
Meet.

A track meet between the Frcsllr
men and Sophomores, of winch
there has been some talk of late,
will probably take place early in
the spring. Owing to the great
need at new material next spring
this will certainly be a good plan
as it is sure to bring out many
good men who otherwise would
not enter athletics.

If the contest ialres place it will
be very interesting as both classes
have excellent material and are
jealous enough to make it a strug-
gle'from start to ﬁnish. The
Freshmen outnumber the other
Sophomores and may be able to
develop more material btit the
sophomores already possess a lair
nurubcr of good men anti
count on several more developing
into winners.

The meet will bc held under the
supervision of the collcgc track
team management anti meets
their hearty approbation. and any
service they may render in the
way otcoaching or training will
be most willingly tendered.

Day of Prayer.

Iowa College was fortunate in
procuring such an able and earnest
man as Rev. Mr. McKenzie for
the clay of player. Mr. McKenr
zie comes to us irom Chicago,
where hci engaged as a professor
in the Chicago Theological som-
inary. He rs a man possessing
tare qualities and abilities, is an
cainest and impicssiirc speaker.
and has a strong and marked in-
(livitluality.

The ﬁrst meeting was at to A. it.
in tlle Chapel where Mr. McKen-
zie addressed the students. He
said rn part: There are three qucsr
tions that harbor in the minds of
thinking people, the answers of
which are in many cases sought in
vain, and found only after
longandu-carreosearchandstudy.
The ﬁrst is, Whence are we? the
second, Whither are we going?
and the third is, What are we to
do? Man knows not from whence
he comes, it is all speculation, we
have no (acts from which to draw
conclusions. ButJohn says: ~th
arc the children of God;” thisis
no speculation; this is not philos
opli ‘ it is notaloglcalconclur
sion; yea, it is more, it is an ex
pericncc. Philosophers and sci-
elitists of today ﬁrst get the facts
and then philosopliize. get the
experience. then draw conclusions,
Why not be as practical in our rc~
ligious duli .. First get the ex~
perience oi the inspired men then
it is cleal to us whence we are,
and whither we go. When once
WC have settled th two ques
tions, then we are ready to ask,
What are we to do? A nlan know
we his origin has a clear idea of
Ills destination. If we are of God
we are to do Hw \vlll. Many men
for the reason they cannot see the
mysteries of God will not give
themselves to Hit". Scores of
strong and noble llVCS are being
wasted because of that pet notion,
and of holding to some ideas
gained from philosophy. Into
the wrllrng, open heart comes the
blessed experience of God's pres-
ence. The address closed by a
strong and touching appeal to the
noitrChristians to stand with God’s

chosen.

Directly alter the address, the
classes held separate prayerrnlect-
ings.

’94. The birthday of Miss An-
na Adams was celebrated with a
splendid dinner at the Ludwick
Club today. After the students
had seated themselves around the
magniﬁcently browned turkeys
which graced each table. Miss
Lily Parker rose and in a few well»
chosen notds explained the cause
oftlle unusually ﬁne dinner. Miss
Adams during her college course
had once given‘a club dinner upon
her birthday and she wished to
have the occasion again celebrated
in the same manner although she
herself would be unable to be
present. After dinner the stu-
dents thrntiged into the parlor,
where Miss Case sang two charm-
ing songs and Miss Miller ren-
derctl two piano solos. The peo-
ple of the Ltidivick Club are loud
in their plaises of Miss Adams’
hospitality and ﬁrmly believe
that her birthday could not have
been more ﬁttingly observed.
