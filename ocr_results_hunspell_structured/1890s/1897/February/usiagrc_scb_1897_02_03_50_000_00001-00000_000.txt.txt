H. C. RICHARDSON, Pres.

Grinnell institute.

The program presented at the
meeting of the Grinnell Institute
last Saturday evening was invnlost
respects up to the high standard
which has been maintained at
every meeting this term. The dc-
bate was the only feature of the
program that was weak, and this
fell far below the level.

Stipp opened the program with
a talk on the “Value of Tradition,"
applying his subject to our college
life, both in the class room and in
athletics.

' Robbins read a very good re
view of Theodore Roosevelt's are
ticlc in a late number of the Rt»
aim of Review: on “How not to
Secure Social Reform."

l-lart gave a character sketch
of Conan Doyle's ”Sherlock
Holmes."

Spauldrng's readingchosen tron.
Riley's “After Whiles," retrieved
by a touclt of humor the other»
wise serious program.

The music at the evening con-
sisted of two numbers, a vocal solo
by Mrs.Vittum and an instrument-
al solo by Mrs. Noble. Both
ladies responded to encores, show-
ing the hearty appreciation otthc
society.

The externporaneous work was
good throughout, Crandall's ac-
count ot the woman's surtrage
convention at Des Moines being
especially so. Pope spoke on
”Sherman ill the Cabinct"
Robbins and Shadbolt discussed
the examination question. ,

The debate was on theadoption

t in the United States of the initia-
tive and referendum. Lyman
and Mcl’lose supported the afﬁre
mative and Campbell and Bean
the negative. While tllere was an

and-

 

evidcnce of preparation. the de
bate lett much to be desired, too
much attention being‘paid to out
side issues. The president's de
cision was in favor of the negative.

Track Team Meeting.

A goodly number ot candidates
assembled at the gymnasium M on.

the interest of the '97 track team,

To "report at the gymnasium"
seemed to signrty something and
when Captain Rush called for or-
der, those who gathered about him
appear-ed dressed for the occasion.
having anticipated the result of
the meeting. He urged upon
them the necessity of work; with
training each one can do some
thing; illustration he re
ferred to some of Grinnell's most
famous athletes who trained inceSr
santly for ttvo and three years,
tailing to win even a third place.
He said that it was essential for
all candidates to begin training
immediately, New men should
not hesitate to go into training
because they did not know at
present which events to enter.

ManagerTernpleman was called
on and said that Grlnnell must
tvin the cup this year; that mem-
bers oE two successive teams had
put forth every eiiort to bring the
cuptoGrinnellandarenowwatch»
ing our trials in the ﬁnal result.

No one man Will be able to win
the Cup,7to trin will command a
united ettort. A person winning
a third place, it he wollt's conscir
entiously. is just as deserving and
just as loyal as the ﬁrst place men.

Marsh, Spaulding, Armstrong
and Hart were called upon and
each', emphasized the points
brought out by the captain and
the manager.

A number were absent from
this meeting who should join the
track team. Do not wait to" be
personally persuaded to come out.
The old men alone cannot win,
wthe result rests with the new
candidates. Which will you inalt'c
it. victory or defeat?

Theliterary partotthe program
was given entirely by new mem-
bers and hence was looked for
ward to with more than usual in-
terest by the members.

 

M .Qllaile opened the program
by a speech on the arbitration
trcaty. in which he traced the his-
torical development of the idea of
arbitrating CllFﬁCulllCS from its in—
ception to its culmination in its
present form, namely thc muclr
talkedrof treaty of arbitration be-
tweenthetwogreatEnglishspeak-
ing nations, now pending in the
senate.

Mrs. Potter then entertained
the society by a well rendered
vocal solo, .

Mr. Holopeter gave a paper on
the present status of the Indian
Question, He took the ground
that much of the evil assigned to
the direct result of thetmethod of
his treatment by the whites. The
production showed that the author
had given the subject a good deal
of study and thought, and was in
deed a valuable contribution.

Mr. Lockwood then read a pa-
per In which he emphasized in a
forcible way the idea which we
have seen cropping out recently
in so many quartersithc idea
that a man may be led to be hone
est by being trusted and to dis
honesty by being rnistrusted.

Mr. Way gave a unique char»
acter sketch, in which he described
a peculiar character in the shape
ot a country editor,

The debate was better than usual,

by Glaves and Myers, the negar
tive by Leonard and Marsh, in
the discussion of the‘ question,
Resolved, that the present system
of caucus nomination ought to be
abandoned. The dectsio was in
favor of the afﬁrmative. The pro
grant was the best we have had
this term as was evinced by the
remarks which were current
among the members at its close.

Basket Ball Party.

The Cottage basket ball team
made a very merry ending at the
week tor the ”Scarlets"whom they
gallantly entertained on Saturday
evening. For an hour and a half
the two teams enjoyed a bob ride
and a goodly amount ot cheering,
and then resorted to the Cottage
where an oyster supper was served
in the spacious dining room.
Dancing occupied the remainder
of the altogether too short oven-
ing and the departing guests found
the “bob" at the door waiting to
take them to their homes.
