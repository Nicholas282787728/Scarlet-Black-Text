5. M. Sayford Comlng,

Although wernay notrealizctlre

have opportunities to hear men
prominent irt their particular line
of work such as seldom {all to the
lot of students in colleges with so
tew numbers. such an opportun-
ity is to be given us this year.

Mr. Sayford is a man who is de-
voting his life to christian work
among college students. He is a
graduate of Gettysburg College
and tor several years arter gradu-
ation wasin business in Philadel-
phia. His position is entirely
unique, as he has no ofﬁcial con-
nection with the Y. M. C. A.‘ and
comes upon invitation asa private
citizen to give us practical strggese
trons. He is visiting the leading
colleges and universities or the
country from Yale to Leland Stan-
ford. From his personal knowl-
edge oi college lite and wide ac»
quaintance rvith college men, Mr.
saytord has gained a hearty sym-
pathy with all college interests.

He will talk to the students in
the chapel Saturday evening, at

given up their mectings for tltat
evening—m courtesy to our visitor
which he wrll be sure to appreci-

every student in every department
will take pains to hear him.
There will be no admission
charged. Mr. sayior-d conres to

”On a western Campus,”

There seems to be a somewhat
general impression among the old
students that it they wait long
eno‘ugh before’purchasiug copies
ot the ’93 class annual they will
be able ﬁnally to obtain them at‘
a greatly reduced price. This
impression is decidedly a mis-
taken one. The Annual has had
a steady sale throughout the sunl—
nier and gives promise of still‘

larger sales in the near tuture.
“On a Western Campus" is not a
book of the motncnt. It is of in
terest not alone to those who were
studcn‘s here at the time oi its
publication. While far from porn
tect it remains the very best rep
l'esentative of our college life and
will remain so until another vol»
ume of Iowa College stories shall
be published which shall more
closely present the various phases
of coredtlcntioual life in awestcrn
college. The book has meta vcry
cordial reception among the
friends and alumni of the college
and has received favorable men-
tion from so high an authority as
Professor Brander Matthews of
Columbia College The letter
written by Professor Matthews to
Prof. S. L. Whitcomh with regard
to “On a Western Campus” tvill
be published in our next issue.

To the old student it is the best
nrenrento or his college days. To
the new strident it is desirable as
an epitome of the "Gr-innell
spirit" which has placed our in-
stitution in the forefront of every
progressive movement. It is in
no sense, except in preparation. a
strictly class annual. The class
oi '98 in preparing and publishrng
this book conferred a favor upon
the entire college and to those
connected with the college they
look for support to enable them
to close out the edition without
ﬁnancial loss. ‘

Copies or the Annual are to be
found on sale at allthe bookstores
in the city or may be ordered by
mail from H. L. Beyer, business
manager.
