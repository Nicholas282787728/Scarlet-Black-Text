Football In Grinnell.

(Continued Irotn Sctond Panel
and on November i6th Grinnell
for the ﬁrst time lined up against
Iowa: The game wasundoubtedr
ly unscientiﬁc, but it was “a day
otsmall things," and has proved
"the dawn of mighty ones.” The
score was Griitnell, 24; Iowa. 0.

In the tollowing season, under
the able captaincy ot T. U. Ly-
man, the team played two games:
one with Iowa. on their ground,
in which Grinnell was again vic
torious; the other with the Unis
versity ot Minnesota. at Minneae
polis, which rvas lost.

The season ot 1891 brought
Grinitell football to the highest
point it had reached so lar. G.
A. Lyon, ’92, was elected captain,
and T. U. Lyman. ’gt, retained as
coach. It was this year that the
historic tie~game with Minnesota
was played on our home ground,
and that we rvon trom lorva by
the narrow margin of oer. The
return game with Minnesota was
lost.

In 1892 w. C. McKee was see
cured as physical director of the
college and coached the team. 0.}

R. Savage, '93, was captain. Six
games were played, of which tour
were won and two lost. Both
Minnesota and Iowa defeated us,
and for the ﬁrst time Grinnell did
not win the state championship.

1893 marked the beginning of
the custom oi securing regular
coaches. H. 0. Stickney. the
famous Harvard halfeback, came
early in the season and succeeded
in convincing the members ct tlle
team that they did not know even
the rudiments of football. Only
three games were played. Anies
was defeated 4276, and Iowa 36—
14. Minnesota won 3676.

The coming of “Mike" Bergen
in 1894 really began the develop
ment of/Mtbnll in Grinnell. The
team played this yearin hard luck.
A poorly arranged schedule which
brought a number at hard games
close together is responsible tor
the poor showing on the western
trip. The unfortunate outcome
of the Iowa game which was tor-
feited to them because of a rank
decision when Grinnell had made
three touch-downs to their ttvo,
