won the prize, a handsome copy
ot Gray's Elegy.

time intervening before that event

gratiﬁcation and pleasure at this
time that our ﬁrst debate should
be with an institution where cola
lege literary work is held in high
esteem, and where the standard
oi such work is unusually high.
There is ground lor conﬁdence
tiiat the interest of both institu-

 

tions, in the issue of the contest
warrants the anticipation bcto'rCr
hand or an enjoyable and proﬁt-
able evening. A recent letter-
from Cornell closes with these
\\'0lds'#”lt IS a pleasure to zin»
ticipate the friendly contest be
fore us, and it is the unanimous
wish of Cornell students that it.
success may be biit the beginning
of an annual serics of debates b‘er
