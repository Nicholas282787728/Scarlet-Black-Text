ory iecord. The team was far
better titan its record, as is shown
by the next season ivlien with two
exceptions the make-up of the
team was the same. »

The team of I895 is known as
the one which carried the Grinnell
system to its highest point of de-
velopment. Bergen was with us
again and his magniﬁcent coach~
ing showed its results in the two
victories over Minnesota and Ne
braska. The loss of the Doane
game was due entirely to an ag-
gravated attack of swellrhead.

The disastrous record of 1896
is too well known to need com-
nieni. Eight games were played
ot which only three—those against
Minnesota, Iowa and Des Moines
fare even worthy of mention.

Below is a complete record of
the past with its victories and de
feats. It carries with it lessons
which no amount of Comment can
impress more forcibly,

Manager‘s Statement.

From the standpoint of the
business management, the foot-
ball season of I897 has been a very
satisfactory one. Tile enthusias»
tic support of students and towns»
people, both at the home games,
and at Iowa city and Des Moincs.
has accomplished a twofold rc-
stilt: the cheering has been bettcr
than ever before, and the indebt»
edness which has long hung over
the Athletic Union treasury for a
year and a half has been wiped
out. The management feels very
thankful to all who have co opeie
ated fol the best interests of foot-
ball at Grinncll. For Financial
air] we are again largely indebted
to the merchants of this city who
are always generous in respond
ing to student requests.

The business intelests of tile
’98 team are to be leit in good
hands and we bespeak tor the
new manager the same hearty en»
couragement which has been ex
tended to the former incumbent
of that'oﬂice,

From Our Coach.
in some respects the past scar
soil can be termed the most notee
worthy in Grinllcll football his
tory. While she established no
claim to state championship hone
ors, in the light of the tremendous
odds against it, no Iowa College
eleven ever had greater cause for
pride. We sustained btlt two dee
feats, and while all
should be given our vanquishers, ii
is hard to justify extravagant exe
ultation on their part. That Mine
nesota, heavier 23 poilnds to the
man, scored one touchedown,
should cause no loyal Grinllellite
chagrin. or s. U, I. we will Sime
ply say that she ivon fairly, and
then quote coach Wagenllilrst:
”S. U. I, won lhrough “rupm’or

staying power."

due credit-

 

To me the most encouraging
feature of the season was the mag-
niﬁcent spirit which marked the
leani’s work throughout. Grin-
nell may be oflen deleated in the
future. btit admiration can never
cease to be hers while she exhib-
its the reckless abandon of the
1897 eleven. Much has been said
in the past of Grinllell spirit, but
only those who saw the Ames or
S. U. 1. game. can realize what the
Giiiincll spirit is today.

While l have no words of praise
too strong for the scarlet and
black's gallant athletes. the Grine
iiell spirit can hardly be said to

have attained its ideal; and tliis'

very fact is the greatest hope for
future success. May we not ex-
pect oi it even greater things than
it accomplished this year.
feat does not necessarily imply
disgrace, but it is, neveltheless.
defeat. When defeat carries no
resignation, but only breeds sul»
len, dogged determination for tu-
ture conquest; when iegret is sup-
planted by frenzied ambition to
retrieve, and every advance of the
oval toward our goal becomes for
the tirrlc desecration of sacred
ground, then, and then only. will
this inﬂuence, which we hallow,
have reached its consummation.
