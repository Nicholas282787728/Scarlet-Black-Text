We ARE iii receipt of the '94
class letter, full of assurances of
interest in the welfare of each oth
er, as well as the plans and ex-
pectations of the writers them-
selves. Why is this plan or a
class letter conﬁned to '94? A
class once graduated never meets
again with itsfull number present,
and too often the members entirer
ly lose sight of each other when
they become engaged in the rush
and turmoil of the business world.
This is not caused by a lack of in-
terest in one another. but through
a lack of adequate means of get
ting information. The class let-
ter has been proposed as a means
of keeping the members in com»
munication with each other. arid
the earnestness which

shows how much they value it.
Other classes would do well to
follow this suggestion, the pres-
ent serilor class inclutlcd. '

The critic called this one of the
best of Ellis programs. The
speeches showed that the topics
had been carefully studied and the
debate was interesting and ins-truce
