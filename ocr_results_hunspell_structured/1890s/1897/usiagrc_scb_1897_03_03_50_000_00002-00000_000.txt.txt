Tnc ATHLETIC UNloNbencﬁt unr
dcr consideration for several
weeks has at last been decided
upon in the shape of a concert by
the musical clubs of the State Uni»
versity. Coming as the concert
does, a week before the appeals
ance of our home organizations.
it will afford a splendid opportw
nity to compare their merits.
The fact that it is for the beneﬁt
of the Athletic Union should in-
surea large attendance. In or»
der to continue the contests so
long held between the athletic
teams of the two institutions,
tunds must be provided and that
right soon. Shall we not make
the friendly rivalry between these
organizations productive of means
with which to continue the rivalry
along otherlines. The cooper-a-
tion oi every student is necessary.

THE DESIRE is frequently hcard
expressed that the college library
could be open to tlic students in
the evening. VVllctlicr this do
is stated in all sincerity cannot be
known, but certain it is that there
is room for improvement in the
use to which the library is put by
the students. it must be con-
fcsscd also that the fault lies larger
ly with themselves. I'IOW few of
the under classmcn arc intimately
acquainted with the stores of
knowledge which have been gath~
cred together [or them by friends
of the college past and present, is
a fact brought forcefully into
prominence by a visit to the li-
brary during its busiest hours,
That this is a mistake they will res
alire sooner or later, but when that
realization comes, with it will be
another: that regrets will prove
\Iain instruments with which to re-

efforts aic constantly being model
to bring the otlierclepititnicnts up

knowledge is open without thc use
of which no student can really
complete his course. But it lS not
properly used. This neglect of

mands reform, and the reform
ninst originatc with those (or
whom the library is provided it
the cause lies iii the inability or
the students to arrange their woil;
so as to avail themselves of the li-
brary as now conducted. let it be
open in the evening, but Obselvar
tion would lead to the conclusion
that the chief cause is not the one
stated above. Rather is it to be
found in the indifference of the
students themselves. This is the
fault to be remedied and the l'cm~
cly must be applied by those most
vitally interested. Students, taltc
the advice of an honored member
of the faculty and "disturb the
quiet of the library a little more."
