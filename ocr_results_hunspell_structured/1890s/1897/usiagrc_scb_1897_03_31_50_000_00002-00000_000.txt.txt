THE ANNUAL oratorical contest
of the Giinnell Institute will be
held Saturday evening, We are
glad to see that the spirit of the
orator still lingers with us even
though athletics and outdoor
amusementsarebeginningtooHei‘
their allurements. The societies
are doing a good work in keeping
up the oratorical work ot the Cole
lege in the absence of any instrucV
tor in that particular line. The
ability is here and all that is need
ed is a irttie rousing up and a
chance to display itself, and that
is what these oratorical contests
offer. The time has been so taken
‘up this term that it has been hard
to get a suitable night, but Satur-
day night was ﬁnally decided upon
as the one best suited for the pur-
pose. We wish to commend the
persistence of those having the
affair in charge since the arrange»
ments have been so greatly re-
tarded. The oratorical contest
‘and the joint debate, coming as
they do at the end of the winter
term, should-receive the closest
attention. as they practically close
this kind of work for the year. fm
next term the rule of athletics will

again begin.

THE HONOR systcm question is
being agitated in many of the col—
leges and universities of the coune
try, and it seems to be the general
opinion among them that the ques-
tion should be carefully consid—
ered before any
adopted. 0n the other hand, it
seems to be the clearly recognized
duty ot every student to makc up
his mind and place himself deﬁnit-
ly on one side or the otller. Here
we have voted to adopt a system
of some kind. but the question
does not end here. The thing
