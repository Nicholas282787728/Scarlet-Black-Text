vanin tandenr was a sad (limo
pointment during the ﬁrst half
and, according to Coach \Nagcn-
hurst of S U. 1, nos stopped
better by Grinnell than any team
he had ever seen. Not till ﬁfteen
minutes of the second half were
gone, and our light men. worn out
by hard offens‘lve l\'Ol'l\' and hat.
tercd by s, U. I.‘s heavy mass
plays, were unable to continue the
superb deicnac oi the ﬁrst half,
was the University able to make
steady gains.

Grinnell has only words or
praise [or the conduct of S U, L's
men during the game. Theirplay
was cle‘an and manly. while Messrs.
Brernner and Stlpp are beyond
question the tnost competent nf-
ﬁcials in Iowa today.

Oi two things, however, SCAR-
LET AND BLA'CK feels justiﬁed in
melting complaint The gamc
was billed for 2:30 o'clock. Not
an 5, ul player appeared until
2:40 and the ball was not kicked
off until one minute of three. As
a result, the last ﬁfteen or twenty
minutes of tire gnmc were played
in darkness, a thing disagreeable
to. spectator and player alike.
Again. tlrc control at the crowd
was execrable,7lar dil'terent from
what a visiting team has a right
to expect, and. as we believe,
what is accorded visiting teams at
Grinncll. Ltzt no one think Grinr
nell ascribes its defeat to the above
causes. 5. U. I won on its merits;

Committee held ccntly. it was‘
suggested that in place of the‘

touchdown. one tor a goal trom
touchdown. for goal from
ﬁeld and one for safety. No ac-
