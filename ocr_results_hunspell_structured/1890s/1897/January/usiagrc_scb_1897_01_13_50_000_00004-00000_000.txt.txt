Mr Mills’ iectule last evening
on the “Christianization o( Chris-
tianity” was the crowning one ot
the course, It deserves a full re-
port. but it is only possible here
to give a very general outline ol
it and some ol the most forcible
statements made.

Mr, Mills started out by pro-
posing three questions: Does the
church adequately represent
Christ? Doesitinadcqtlatelyrep»
represent him? And does it mis-
represent him? The whole lecture
was taken up in answering these
questions.

The church misrepresents
Christ. First in applying a theo-
logical arrd dogmatical rather than
a moral and spiritual tcst for
membership. “Just so far as the
church ceases to be an institution
founded in the spirit of Christ (or
the purpose of carrying out the
teachings of Christ it fails in its
mission." The second cause for
misrepresenting Christ is the divi-
sionsamongourselves. Theclaim
that there is a necessity for differ-
ent sects is a foolish one, the
churches needs to be united in ct-
tor-t. Tire churches misrepresent
Christ in the internal management
of then-affairs. (a) In their means
of support. One of these wrong
means is pew rents, the effect of
which is to make a distinction be-
tween the rich and poor in the
church. (b) The affairs of the
churches are quite largely direct-
ed by ungodly men.

The next question which he
took up was, Does the church in-
adequately represent Christ? The
churches do not do the work they
might in saving sinners. Tire
