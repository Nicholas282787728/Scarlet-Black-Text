Chreslomatl'lians Win.

Last evening the second joint
debate between the Grinncll Insti»
tute and the Chrestomathian Lit~
erary Society was held at the
College Chapel.

The attendance rvas poor and
showed conclusively that it more
interest is not manifested we can
have no hope oi winning irorn our-
doughty opponents of Cornell
College.

The debate was a good one
Each speaker showed that he had
done careful and conscientious
work in preparation. The tlclive
cry of most or the contestants ivas
fair, but lacked the ﬁery enthusi»
asni thatis inosterfectivc at times

The question for discussion was:
”(SHIT/[1L That the intcrcstsoi the
people ot the United States are
better served by the system of
government now in use by them
than they would be by the adope
tion oi the English Cabinet Syse
tem.

The limitations were:

(i) The existence oi the Enge
lish crown, thc‘hereditaty House
at Lolds, and other hereditary
privileges. shall be cxcluded as
afﬁrmative arguments.

(2) The question is to be dis
cussed on its merits, and the initial
difﬁculties and friction likely to
be experienced in inaugurating
such a system shall be excluded
as aFﬁr-inativc arguments.

ported the afﬁrmative wcre rcpree

T. A. Willian., '97, and Paul
Peck, 97; and the Gtinncll lusti»
late by H. A. Huii. '97, n. C.
Marsh, '98, and Il. H. hicliosc,
as.

This is the second joint tlcl)atc
evet held between the two college
societies. Attempts have been
made in recent years to bling the
societies together, and we hope
that joint debates liom tl s on

will be a permanent feature in,

college life,

Joint debates are coming to
take the place oi orator-ical coll~
tests all over the country, and
should create as much interest
and enthusiasm as athletic con-
tests.

Tire debale last evening would
do credit to any college in the
country.

The judges decided the debate
in favor of the afﬁrmative. and so»
lcctcd Messls. Marsh, Peck and
l’inci‘. with iIcl-losc as substitute,
to represent Grinneil in the intern
collegiate debating contest with
Cornell College.

The intercollegiate debate is to
be held here the ﬁrst of next
term, and judging hour the work
oi last night, Griiinell no
cause to tear but that its reprc-
sentatives will do credit to their
college.

The ﬂiolian Mandolin Club
favored the audience with music
