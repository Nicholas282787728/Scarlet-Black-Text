Intercollegiate Debating.
u at M. hail).

In this month's Fowl/n there npr
pears an article h-om the pen oi
Professor Ringtvalt of Columbia
on intercollegiate dcbntlng. Two
reasons are assigned for the res
neival of interest in speaking and
discussion during the past two
years—the repeated attacks on
athletics and a new kind of liter»
ary activity.

Ever since i893 the history or
debating shows that it has been
expanding. Dual and triangular
leagues have been formed until
nearly every nniversity is yearly
represented in one or more do-
hates.

The writer is of the opinion that
there are two dangers incident to
college debating. The ﬁrst is that
oi coaching by the raculty. He
believes that during the past two
years there has been a marked
tendency {or members at the lac-
tilty to take an active part in the
preparation of the debate. II this
continues. there \\ill be a dcclint‘,
1nd the debates will degenerate
ltllt) contests between the d:
'nt boards otinstructinn, in which
he speakers nill omciate only in
he capacuy at well trained mouth
The other danger is that
of over doing. Several of the
universities seemingly are not
content with 'vaisity debates and
have held freshman contests
While they have been creditable
attaiis, the success proves nothing
at all. but simply emphasizes the
ﬁrst danger spoken olithat the
debatcr is but a mouth piece and
that a freshman can make a hit if
provided with the proper material.

These evils, however, will not
lessen the hold that intercollegir
ate debating has taken upon the
people. for the interest is too deep
and widespread. The same err
thnsiasm that marks a victory in
athletics attaches nowadays to
one in debating and the same dis-
tinctions are given the winners
that are accorded to the athletes.

Columbia’s Gymnasium.

The new gymnasium oi Colnm

Seth Low, will be the Finest builds

new building, which will be known

5450.000. and work upon them has
already begun. As it approaches
completion the plans will bc made
to suit whatever condition the
needs oi the university require.

The entrance to the gymnasium
is on the ground level with the
street, and on the ground ﬂoor is
the swimming pool. This pool
will contain 240,000 gallons of ﬁle
teted water, and will be about
twice the size of the tank in the
Yale gymnasium. Around the
edges ot the building _ will be
placed showers, needle baths,
lockers and dressing rooms.

The gymnasium will be, like the
pool, in the shape of a halt—moon.
Over its widest part it will he r70

apparatus Ior physical develop-
ment will be made use of. Over

lcct wide and nine laps to the
In the southern portion of
the building will be the athletic
rooms and directors' apartments.

The alumni of Columbia are
trying to raise a sum large enough
to purchase an athletic ﬁeld near
the gymnasium ' change.

As matters now stand in the nor
gotiations between Yale and Har-
vard. relative to resuming athletic
relations. it seems,probable that
they will be brought together in
baseball, football and track evcnts,
but that no satisfactory arrange»
ment will be made for a boat race.
The sentiment among Yale underr
graduates is overwhelmingly in
favor of the movement, and the
Harvard undergraduates also
seem to decidedly tavor a reunion
between the two universities,
