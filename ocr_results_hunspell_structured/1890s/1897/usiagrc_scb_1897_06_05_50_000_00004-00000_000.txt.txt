sketclios are based is tiequently
struck by the accuracy with which
actual events have been GCi'o-
duced; and yet the book is noth-
ingiess than narrowly local, and
the skill and right instinct with
which the authors have caught
and ﬁxed the general import oi
the particular, deserves high
praise. Even in Cllzll'acter-anzllys
sis, the capacity for which is usu-
ally developed only through wide
and deep experience, tlicreis good
work done in those pages. The
univeisal human note is not want»
ing. though most oi the lite repre-
sented necessarily plays within
rather narrow limits; and an occa-
sional touch of out—door nature,
not overdone, gives pleasing color
to the whole.

It is not easy tor anyone, it is
doubly dirﬁcult tor a young auth-
or, to be truly pathetic; but there
is undoubtedly genuine pathos in
a few of these stories. The more
frequent attempts at humor seem
to me less successiiil; perhaps
Molicre was right when he main-
tained that it is a good deal harder
to weartlie socciisgraceiully than
to stalk impressively in tragic
buskins on the stage, Biit tastes
dirter, especially in this matter;
andsomercadersmaylaughabun
clantly where others ﬁnd it hard
to crack a smile.

I have already alluded to one ,

defect of this volume. considered
as a collection of ﬁction—the com-
parative lack oi action,'or, in gen
eral, ot dramatic quality inmost
of the stories. With time and
practice, doubtless, the authors
will learn to construct a ﬁrm and

 

well~i0untletl plot, and to rcpre
sciit complete and consistent chars
actcrs. Some of them have made
a notable beginning in that three
tion; they will all need to develop
caietully whatever constructive
imagination they may possess, if
they wish to proceed ironisketchcs
to stories, and [tom notes of obs
servntiou to the novel.

The thirteen stories of the col-
lection are grouped rather loosely
under [our heads, which are neith-
er particularly correlated, nor cx-
clusive ol each other, the last es-
pecially being a very general title,
under which other of the sketches
might be included. However,
the grouping iion't bite anybody,
and it is doubtless a practical con»
vcniencc The collection is tini-
ﬁed, in a way, by its constant rel-
creiice to student lire, though it
docs go tar beyond the limits of
the u-cstcrn campiisthat furnishes
the title, and though in two or
three cases the tilt: of the student
is somewhat in the background.
But under the circumstances gov»
criiingthcpioduction oi thestoi-ies
it is rather remarkable that they
do form so harmonious a volume
as is actually the case.

“On a Western Campus" does
not tellthe whole story of midland
college hic, nordoes it pretend to
do this. Perhaps some readers
will either get a somewhat incom~
pietc view of things as they aie.
or else wonder mildly at the com-
parative impoitaiice things seem
to have for the student mind But
so tar as the book goes and is in-
tended to go, it is .a thoroughly
creditable piece of \\’0ll(, and the
authors may feel that, in its publi-
cation, they have done honor to
their training, and to the class and
the institution they represent,
They have made a very bold ven-
turc, and succeeded in it.
