THE CHANGES in the icquirer
ments for admission. while they

may be viewed somewhat dubiousr
1y by some at ﬁrst, are beyond

question. a distinct step in the
right direction, and upon careiul
consideration must, ive think, he
honestly commended by all. This
action is wholly in harmony with
the adoption of the group system
two years ago, and the combined
result or the two will he a signal
gain in the standard of Gl‘lnneii
scholarship. and will mat-e for the
standing of the college in the
scholastic world. Every one who
has the true intcrcsts of the col-
legc at heart, desires to see Grin—
nell degrees acknowledged as sec-
ond to none among those granted
by the best institutions of the
land. To such friends that day
will be welcome which sees the
recognition alreadygiventhequal-
ity of the work done here, cxtcnd—
ed to its completeness in extent.
- The progress made during the
past two years assures the hope
that the beginning or the second
halfrcentury of the college will see
her meeting the highest standard
of requirements, and ﬁrmly estab
lished in the foremost rank of the
higher institutions of learning.

THE ADVANCE sale of seats for
the Glee Club and Orchestra con-

ceeds that of last year, Neverthe-
less we hope to see the sale great-
ly increased, It is an opportunity
which lovers of music should not
miss, tor they are undoubtedly

tions in the state, as the glowing

convene on ncxt\\7crlucstlay evenr

Tile rules as proposed are pith
