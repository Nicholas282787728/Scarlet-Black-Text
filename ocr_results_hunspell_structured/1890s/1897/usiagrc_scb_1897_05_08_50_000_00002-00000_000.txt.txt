WlliLe VICTORY did not rest
with our debaters last night, the
showing they made was an exr
tremely creditable one and the
college may well be proud of its
representatives. We hope that
nothing ivill occur to prevent the
torrnation or a permanent league
between the schools, a movement
which would undoubtedly stimu-
late interest in this work in both
colleges. it is to be hoped that
earlier action may be taken next
year so the debate may come be-
fore the distractions of the spling
term are upon us.

There is abundance of censure
due to somebody or to the whole
student body that tile attendance
last night was so meagre. The
fact that it was an unfortunate
time for a meeting here does not
excuse the discouragingiy small
audience which greeted the (lee
baters. A great brace must be
taken it we expect to deserve and
receive such able and creditable
representation as was given us in
this debate. It is time now to
p‘ian\cntlrusiastic support tor our
representatives in the next debate.

The Debate.
(Quorum/front First rites.)
lievcd the cure would be worse
than the disease. Owing to the
dependence on the legislature the
English executive VcLiS with ev»
ery popular caprice. Tire English
cabinet minister's whole idea isto
keep in ofﬁce. our government

is the more conservative.

Mr. I’cck's manner was veiy
convincing and easy and his was
one of the best elilotts of tlic cw
cning.

Mr. O. B. Waite, '97, of Coincll,
closed the debate and rebuttal (or
Cornell. Mr. White's speech was
largely rebuttal and he showed
himself to be a master of the Sill)-
ject, He no doubt effected the
decision ol the judges more large
ly than any or his coilegi-ans. it
would be useless to attempt even
a brier resume ot his points. but
perhaps his strongest one was that
the American system is merely a
negative one, not a constructive
system.

Mr. Finer closed in rebuttal [cl
Griiinell and showed that their
arguments ofthe defects at our
system was no reason wiry their
system would work successiully
here or that the excellencies of
the English system in England
does not prove that they would
cxcellencies here.

The judges or tlreevening were:
Chancellor Emliii McClain, State
University; Proicssor]. c. Loos,
State UniverSlty; Professor L. W.
Parish, State Normal School.

Chancellor McClain, iii K
the decision of the judges, stated
that the judges had the greatest

difﬁculty in arriving at a decision,
but that owing to the [act that the
burden of proof iested on the at-
ﬁrmative and there seemed to be
no preponderance ot proot they
gave the unanimous decision in
favor of the negative.

The Cornell debaters easily cx~
celled in rebuttal and extcmporc
work while Gi'iniiell showed up
well in logical arrangement and
presentation of their subject.
