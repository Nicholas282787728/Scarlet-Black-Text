Survey Shows
College Was
Worthwhile

New York, (ACP)—IS or is not
college worth while?

Refuting the “depressing" evi~
dence of John R. Tunis' book,
“Was college Worth While?” a
study of the graduates of the class
of ‘11 01' the school of commerce,
accounts and finance of New York
university, reveals the answer to
he an emphatic “Yes."

Based, like the Tunis hook, on
graduates of 25 years ago, the

' school of commerce survey showed
that out of 48 reporting, only one
is unemployed.

0f the others, 17 are accoun-
tants, ten are in banking and ten
are executives in manufacturing
and mercantile enterprises. Other
occupations include public service
corrurdssioner, bank examiner, in.
surance, real estate, publishing,
transportation, foreign trade,
salesman, lawyer and teacher.

The earnngs of the group have
been considerably greater than the
average for the population and
considerably greater than those of
any comparable groups of college
graduates of which the investiga-
tors had knowledge. The average
income in 1911 was $1,322 and in
1936, $11,400.

In tahulating other than eco-
nomic features, the report showed
that 43 out of the 48 are married,
This is said to be nine percent
above the average. No divorce is
reported, compared with seven
percent among Harvard men, four
percent at Yale and six percent
among Princeton graduates of the
same year.

Politically, the class showed
much the same alignment as their
contemporaries among Harvard,
Yale and Princeton graduates.
Twentyeeight listed themselves as
Republicans, ten as Democrats,
and eight as independents.

As has always been the cu5e
tom, the triple cut system will re~
main in force. Any student who
is absent from the last recita-
tion before a recess or the first
recitation after a recess, in any
course for which he is registered,
receives triple cuts for each class
exercise missed.

All former rules regarding ab—
sences, Miss McCandless said. re-
main in force for all students, ex-

number of cuts allowed to first
and second year students over
juniors and seniors.

Scoring Drive

A scoring drive by the Blue»
jays late in the second quarter
was cut short by the gun ending
the half, Creighton had the hall
on the Grinnell two—yard line at
the time.

Grinnell's only scoring. threat
came toward the end of the game,
but was stopped when Ziezel iii-
tercepted Evans' pass intended for
Hayward on the lCreighton 10—
yard line, returning the hall to the
Grinnell 27.

Punting Duel

The game began with Creighton
kicking off to Grimes and there-
after consisted of a puntingl duel
with Homann and Hayward best»
ing Pict. Both teams were play-
ing for the breaks as the rain
which began in the late,after»
noon continued without a letrup
throughout the game. Both back—
fields moved slowly and expe .
enced difficulty in holding the
hall.

For the Pioneers, Homann led
the play by his drives off-tackle
and around the ends. Gﬁnnell’s
passing attack was thoroughly
bottled up by the alert Creighton
hacks and the weather. Grimes,
Wittrock and Hayward were out
standing in the Pioneer front
wall, while Robinson and Evans
stood out in the backfield.

Fiet’s drives, passes and kicks
were largely responsible for the
Bluejay victory.
