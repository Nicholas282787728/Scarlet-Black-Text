Dibble Eagle
Goes Way
of All Flesh

“And the Dibhlc eagle reigns su-i
premem”

Not for awhile, at least, will this
cry ring out over the Grinnell cam-
pus.

For during spring vacation, the
bird with the cast-iron constitution
which had weathered many a storm
from the Dibble roof, took a trip, via
freight, to an unknown destination.
Dibhlites have their suspicions of
those who supervised the shipment.

Then this week, an attempt to ap-
propriate a small glass eagle from a
Newton filling station was frustrat-
ed liy police officers there. Newton
and Grinnell newspapers carried
stories of the apprehension of the two
Grinnell students in charge of oper-
ations,

i-angle, Frank Piersol’s piano rccital
at Herrick chapel. and the dance
drama presented by the department
of physical education.

Saturday morning the tennis
courts, swimming pool, and the vol-
leyball court will be open to any
girls who wish to participate in
these sports. The feature of the
morning will he the final game ol
the women's intramural baseball
tournament,

picnic on south campus, there will be
social dancing and a program in the

for Dual Meet

Grinnell Counts on Second,
Third Places to Win
Affair Saturday

A dual track meet between Grin-
ncll college and Drake university
will be held in conjunction with the
Interscholastic track and field meet
here Saturday afternoon,

Although Grinnell and Drake have
opposed each other on other occa-
sions this season, this will be the first
outdoor dual meet between the two:
Drake boasts of several strong men.
including four who placed in the
state indoor track meet, so that
Grinnell will be relying on the sec-
end and third places in order to win
the meet.

Good Race Expected

A good race is expected in the
loo-yard dash, with Frank Smith,
Drake indoor champion, and Harold
Alexander, co-captain of the Pio-
neers. Both have establishcd times
under ten seconds this season,

Schnceman, Drake broad jumper,
nosed out Clarence “Snap" James by
a few inches to win the state indoor
title, but since that time James has
improved considerably. and the con-
test will probably not be one of past
records. Another close race is ex-
pected between Wallace Grounds, oi
Grinnell. and Stilwell in the high
hurdles, with Grounds holding the
advantage so far this year in compe-
tition.

Pilhrow Undefeated

Gallagher, 440 man, and Blanck,
shot putter, are other men who will
be expected to take points for the
visitors. Co-captain Mike Pilbrow,
whojsrundefeated so far this season
in the two. ile run. will be expected
to repeat his victories. being con—
tested by Thompson, Drake distance
rnan.

Following are the records for the
meet:
