WILHELM PAUCK

Although comparatively young, Dr. Wilhelm
Pauck, who will complete the 1933 Gates lecture
series. in chapel, tomorrow morning. by no means.
fails to measure up to the high standards set by
such brilliant men as Rufus Jollcs, Harry F. Ward,
and Reinhold Niehllllr—spcakcrs of previous
years.

Dr. Pauclt has pcrllaps been adequately dr-
scribcd as a conservative lllodcrllist. Although
modern in llla ' ways. he is d tillctly opposed to
the humanist. ideas becoming widespread in
Christendom today.

He also believes, us we tlo, that contrary to
popular opinion, the fact that the avcrac’c vollcgr
student shows 1ch enthusiasm toward the church
does not mean that there have been disrupting
changes ill the ideals and convictions of the stu-
dellt, but that it is due to the concentrated state
of campus life.

“A boy or girl, coming from the normal
Christian family and the church environment on-
ters college with the dcsiro lo talic pal-l ill the
life on the campus and the activitil-S it offers.
which perhaps lahc considerable time rather than
the church life to which he may have been accus—
fouled.”

This indifference, however does uot usualll'

SCIENCE AND RELIGION

What is the religious belief of the Student ol'
today who has a sound background of Science,
philosophy and history? Ask such a Student this
question and his answer will he vagllc and confus-
ed. More than likely, he will not wish to discuss
the matter, for young Americans do not like to
have their veneer of c nicism and Sophistication
cracked. Perhaps he will say that. he is all agnos-
tic. His childhood beliefs in the tales of the seven-
tlay creation, Jonah and the whale, the conflict, of
Good and Evil, and the parting of the Red sea,
have been shattered.

HANDSBAKING BUGABOO

There are indications that the present year will see
traditions and precedents swept away in many phases
of life. The taboo on the practice of handshahing is one
campus tradition that may well be considered for the
discard pile. Any individual contact between strident
and professor which is initiated by the student seems
to be stigmatized by this dreaded term. Consequently,
if handshaking is to rise to its proper place as a useful
and possibly vital phase of campus life, there will have

to be a general acceptance in undergraduate circles of
the fact that a student may legitimately have an in.

terest in a course that extends beyond concern for his
grade. '

It goes without saying that an interested and in-
telligent student will run across problems that. cannot
be adequately covered in the lecture room, and such a
student is certainly entitled to any individual considera-
tion the instructor is willing to give him Aside from

the academic aspects of this personal contact, there re—

mains the too infrequently discovered tact that most
of the members of the facility are worth knowing as
people.

of course, there are students who deliberately seek
to improve their grades by handshaking, but it is hard to
imagine an instructor so naive as to be deceived by a
feigned interest and knowledge which is not borne out
by recitations and examination papers.

All, yrs! And yet—

MID—VICTORIAN SOCIAL nouns

The interfraternlty council at the University of cm.
eago at present is considering a proposal that would
allow fraternity men to bring coeds to their chapter
houses for dinners lasting until 8 o'clock on evenings
from Monday until Friday and to lengthen the time
women might be guests in fraternity houses on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday nights until midnight. The Daily
Northwestern recently conducted an editorial campaign
advocating that coeds at Northwestern, which now has
a one o'clock limit, be allowed to stay out until 2 or
2:30 a. m.

The Daily Northwestern stated editorially in part:

“Is it . . . agreed among the women on this campus
that they are not qualified or equal to conducting them-
selves properly after 1 a. m. on Friday and Saturday?
Look for a minute at the situation at the University of
Chicago. This school is avowetlly one of the foremost in
educational experiments and modem developments. Yet
their university regulations for women are very few.
Is it because the women at this school are any more
independent, or selfrreliant. or experienced than our own
coeds? Perhaps it might be that the institution, in
placing confidence in its women students by almost un-
limited freedom, considers its time better spent in foster-
ing high educational ideals than in exhausting its enel»
gies in seeing that the girls are all home at 1 o’clock.

These are only two of a large number of similar ex»
pressicns of collegiate attitude toward women’s social
hours, and they come from universities which already
have far more lenient regulations than Indiana.

Visitors from many of the other larger colleges
probably would consider this university inid.Vietorian in
its policy as to women’s social hours. It is true that our
10:30 rule applylng on Sunday and weekday nights
and 11:30 on weekends would not have been considered
too lenient do or 50 years ago.

That there should be some regulation, however, is
not to be denied. No one can fail to see that complete
freedom would interfere with scholarship. in view of
that fact the 10:30 rule is reasonable enough for Mon-
day, Tuesday and Thursday night's. Since Wednesday
and Sunday nights are accepted universally as “date"
nights, the hour might well be extended to 11 p. In.

As for weekend nightsiFriday and Saturday—In»
diana university coeds would not be unreasonable in
asking that the A. w. s. council extend the limit to 1
o'clock. It is difficult to understand why any woman
who conducts herself in a fitting manner up until 11 :30
would not continue to do so for an hour and a half
longer. The Daily student suggests that the A. w. s.
council investigate the plausibility of a change in the
social hours for women and act on its conclusions as
soon as possible.

Enrollment This Semester
Decreases Five Per Cent

A decrease of only four and one-
half per cent in enrollment is noted
this semester, according to figures in
the office of Louis V. Phelps, treas-
urer, There are 30 less students in
school than there were at the begin-
ning of the first semester, making
the present enrollment 643.

Four men students were graduated
at mid-term and 21 dropped out be-
canse of financial difficulties, grades
or personal matters. Three new men
enrolled this semester.

Two women were graduated at the
end of the semester and nine dropped
out, which three coeds entered for
the second semester. ‘

Mr. Phelps stated that this
was “heavier than ordinarily,
mainly to the banking situation
