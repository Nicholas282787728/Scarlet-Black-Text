THE SIXTH ANNUAL GRINNELL SESSION

We Reprint the Following Editorial from the Friday
September 13th, issue of the Des Molnes Registel

Perhaps never in the history of our present civillzzr
tion was there greater need for the universal doing of
what is being so well done ill Iowa at Grlnuell college,
where the sixth annual Gl‘illllell student conference on
international relations is to be held on Friday and Satur-
day of this week. .

Armistice day was featured this year by the Wide»
spread observation that its celebration, 18 years after the
return of peace to a waraweal'y \l'orld, fell lll the midst of
unprecedented preparations for the next warﬁprepal-a-
tions being rushed madly forward in all parts of the
world.

Whatever counter-agent to this movement is even»
tually to arise to check it must be looked for as the crear
till‘e of intelligent and hopeful conferences of the kllld
for which Grillllell sets a splendid example.

Elllinently qualified speakers will address the gath—
ering and preside as round table leaders. The program
for the sixth conference is comprehensive, ranging from
the Far East, through Europe and the United States to
Latin America; and embracing- the political, the economic,
and the social aspects of the problems discussed

It is significant that the desire for a pacific earth
and for the betterment of international relations which
alone can fulfill that desire, is developing expression and
leadership, not oil the edges or zit the center of the proba
blc fighting zones of coming war, but ill calm centers of
culture as surely remote from those zones as in Grillllell.

——G—‘
ARE WE RIGHT?

Unfortunately, there are many ill the United States
today who are still congratulating themselves on our
“hands-off" policy ill regard to the League of Nations
For, say they, with characteristic American complacency,
look at the mess the League has made of things; did it
stop Japan’s invasion of Manchul a? Did it prevent the
Ethiopian war? Have its champions done anything ex
cept make a lot of pretty speeches? How gratifying it
is that we have sense enough to stay out of such an ell-
tan glement l

Perhaps we are wise to remain outside the League,
but ill cognizance of its attempts to bring about world
peace, it might be well for us to stop patting ourselves on
our backs long enough to consider a few of the views
which Mr. George Glascow states in the October Fort»
nightly Review. In his opinion, the single fact that two
of the world’s greatest powers—Germany and Russia~
were refused membership destroyed the League before it
was born; furthermore, the United States refused to be
a palt, and that would have destroyed the League were
lt not already destroyed.

Therefore, he suggests that we are apparently not
yet ready for a League. At any rate, all we have had is
three or four powers who have “staged a pantolnine of a
League of Nations,” and it would seem that the Ameri-
can "arell’t-we-clever” attitude is hardly justified.

which may keep him from the st.
Louis game next week. The others
received only slight injuries.

Coe got its first touchdown ear-
ly in the second quarter, after
Hayward's kicking had kept the
Pioneers out of danger during the
first period. Taking the ball on
his own 24-yard line, Carson spun
through tlle Grinnell line and
drove to the Pioneer Saryard
stripe, In two more plays he
crossed the goal line standing up.
The/try for point was no good.

Later in the querrer, the same
Carson took Hayward's punt on
his own 45 and twisted to the
Pioneer goal line for the second
Kohawk marker. Bazos kicked the
extra pomt, making the score at
half time 134).

The third quarter remained
scoreless, but early in the fourth
period the Pioneers cornered Coe
deep in their own territory. The
kick out was short and rolled out
of bounds on the Cce 20. From
there Evans drove across for the
touchdown after havllng been par-
tlally tackled at least three times.
Schlotterbeck’s try for point
