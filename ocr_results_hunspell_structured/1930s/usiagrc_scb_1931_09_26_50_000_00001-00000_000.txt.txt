Leta Riniker, will be continued this
Year, it was decided at a. mass meet-
ing of Grinnell college sophomore,
junior and senior women in the little
theater Wednesday night.

Cottage parlors will be open to
Visitors only between 1:30 and 4:30

wards this policy was also made
Inﬁll year when cottage parlors were

snorted in 1928

The opening of dormitory club-
rooms is the result of a gradual
growth of social activities in the
men's‘halls since the inauguration of
the house mother system four years
ago. Open houses with dancing in the
clubrooms have been frequent and
the opening of the clubrooms on Sun-
day night will rank as another step
in that direction.

Quadrangle rules in general will
remain the same this year as last,
Georgia Murray, president, announc-
ed at the meeting Wednesday. There
will be a change in the minute Sys~
tem, however, each student being al-
lowed 15 minutes after hours each
week. In case her unexcused minutes
exceed 15 she will forfeit her late
privileges for the next week.

New Ventilator

Any cases of unexcuSed minutes in
large numbers will be taken up by
the league board. _

Luella J. Read, dean of women,
gave a short talk on smoking and
announced that the smoking room in
Cottage Four is being equipped with
a ventilator and an improved heat-
ing system is being installed.

Miss Read said that while Grinnell
college does not prohibit smoking by
its women, it does not encourage the
habit. She emphasized the superior

not smoke in applying for a position
after graduation.

Students Receive Less Than One-Ninth
of Total Instruction Offered at Grinnell

By GEORGE CUSHMAN

A Grinncll graduate may believe
that in his four years he has received
a good education, and has taken
about all the instruction that Grin-
nell offers. Such a student is mis—
taken, however, for in the fourryedr
period one receives loss than one-
ninth of the instruction offered at
Grinnell.

A checkrup of the college catalog
reveals that there are 1155 semester
hours available. At the rate of
15 hours a semester, it would take
as years to receive all this instruc-
tion, and at the end of this there
would be 15 hours left.

In this so years at Griunell a stu—
dent may receive courses in 34 do
partmcnts. This tigurc includes so-
ciology which is made up entirely of
courses from other departments. It
can hardly be called a department it-

self.

A studcnt could spend three years
studying nothing but English Cours-
es and still not have consumed all
the 91 hours offered in that depart~
ment, This does not include English
x since no credit is given for it.

A student would spend almost as
much time in the mathematics de-
partment. This section is second to
English with as hours. Next is the
economics department with '24 hours
and the business administration sec-
tion with 60. Courses described in
other sections are not counted in
thesc totals.

The smallest number of hours is
found in the mechanical drawing de—
partment. Only four semester hours
are offered, Astronomy is next with
six semester hours. The avcrage
number of hours for each depart—
ment is 35.

With a flashy veteran quarterback,
Hank Thomas, leading the parade,
Grinnell's green 1931 eleven showed
perfect blocking against Coe here
Friday night to open the season with
a 25 to o victory.

Coach Moray Eby's yellow-stock
inged aggregation didn’t have a
chance against the fast-charging
home outfit and threatened only
twice during the entire contest. Long
runs and some sensational passing by
Thomas kept fans on their feet dur-
ing a part of every quarter of the
contest.

Air Game Good

,Grinnell completed three of seven
passes and while the regulars were
in the game it was a two out of four,
margin and those two were both good
for touchdowns. The success of the
Pioneers air attack proved that the
graduation of Ruff may not prove as
disastrous as at first'feared.

Otto Golz, who has led Glinneli end
candidates this season was injured
early in the game but Edman, Dun»
can, and McKee handled the wings
without much difficulty.

Thomas Starts

The Pioneer quarterback opened
the scoring in the middle of the first
canto when he followed James‘ six—
yard slash with a 74-yard jaunt
around left end behind exceptional
interference.

A fumble by Byrnes paved the way
for Grinuell’s second touchdown early
in the second chukker, Graflund re-
covering. Thomas passed to Ullrich
on the first play for 35 years and a
touchdown. Ulli-ich‘s kick was good:

Cue Threatens

Coe, with Rouse and Forney pound-
ing the line, advanced to Grinnell's
36ryal'd stripe late in the period.
Smith picked up 16 yards at end and
then fumbled, Edman recovering on
