DISPROPORTION

Tho trzidition that credit Eor a college cou'se
should be based on the number of llollrs which
one spends in a lass room each week. rather than
on the number of hours required for preparation
and knowledge of tlic ooursc seems allnoﬂ as silly
at the present time as the tradition that to s
should be based on leal estate rathol than on iii-
come.

Thcrc arc two-hour courses on the Grinncll
schedule which require inoro work' tliali mnily
thrcerhour colll's Al. the S‘dlIIC time the (‘xmninzle
tions covering these courses for which students rc-
ccirc one hour lcss credit are no less difficult and
no shorter than the tests covering the tlll't‘Crllﬁlll'
courses.

If it is true some of our iiistructo tell us
-that g odes ndl edits are innnatciial, then
this disproportion between cffort and l‘Cll‘tU'd
should mean nothing. But so long- :is tho ‘ondcs
and credits count toward graduation, they are
important. '

Students are restl‘ithd to 16 hours of class
work because it is believed that the average Stllr
dent rminot L ri ‘ a larger load than lhi and
still do ji c to all of hi .oursos, Yet. if his
two-hour courses entail as much work - the
longer courses the purpose of this ruliim ‘ dc-
footed.

“'c are not advocatingi anything so drastic as u
change in the grand old sy. cm of college (-rcdih
hours. However. we do believe that a coulso
should require out, do prcparation in proportion
to the number of hours credit which the studcnt
may obtain. and that the examination over the
course which nets the ‘IlltIOIII. loss credit should
be the shorter and less difficult one.

UNGERTAINTY
During the last months there has been all

interesting change in the attitude ol liberals torn

ward I’re ideut Rooscrclt’s foreign polit a
change from one of four and oppo tion to one
of hopeful uncertainty. Recent action, both at
the Pan Allicricnn conference through Secretary
of State Hull and at “Washington through his own
Wilson memorial speech, throws much light on
tlhe underlying foreign philosophy of: the Presi-
tent.

At first glance we find what seems to be it
strange combination of liberalism and conscrrar
tion. “'0 See a bill for $238,000,000 in new naval

Roosc'elt not only declares against intervention
but lives up to that declaration, We see, the
definite resolution to raise tariff walls wherever
necessary for greater domestic prosperity, and at
the same time the United States delegation at
Moutividco ardcntly supports the principle of hi-
lateral agreements for tariff: reductions. The
President definitely stotcs that there i no intone
tion of our joining the League or Nations at the
same time he praises its activiti 'llltl tolls tho,
world that the League must not he allowed to

He strongly supports nous ion pads,
that they be signed \llltinllllml ly by all the lid-

confidence by thc recognition of R1 ' but hc
has weakened that confidence by limiting: his

CAN AMERICA CRITICIZE
(Minnesota Daily)

As Elmer Davis so admirably pointed out in a re-

cent issue of Harpers, the world is always ready to
acclaim a new martyr. This has been repeatedly dem-
onstrated in the presentrday news dispatches concerns
ing the treatment of the Jews in Hitler's reioh. in
spito'of the fact. that tho war tales of German vio-
lcnoes have been generally discredited, we find many
people today once more ready to visualize the Teutons
as “bloody Scoundrels."
[Hitler and his supporters do not consider the op—
pression of the Jews, which they admit, as anything
but “righteous." The disastrous German inflation of
1922 has hccn laid vaguely at the door of the Jews. it
is firmly believed that. the "Jews are dishonest,” And
so, the Nazis argue, any disoomfiture inﬂicted on them
is no more than their just due. Thai. is the German
View of it.

The American people are really shocked at these
tales of violence, it is true. The protests are very
genuine. Still it is debatable whether we are quite
tree from cri ism ourselves.
think of that recent Delaware lynching? For a truly
disgusting crime a Negro was killed by indignant cit-
izens in the most brutal manner possible. Could Ger-
many find a place in her code for such deeds?

After reading from Exodus and
Tennyson-s "Passmg of Al'tliur,"Dor-
othy Thompson, president of the War
incn's Self Government tongue, poll‘llr
cd out. that although "tho old order
elinngcth giving place to the new '-
nothing should ever change the Grin» '
uell ,spuit.

“When 1 iii-st came to Grinneil col.
lege four ycais ago, I felt. that an me
tangible spirit really did exist," she
said student Tickets
Mis.» Thompson feels, however,
that in tho last year or tvlo there
has been an intangible ebbing away

o'clock.

“A materialistic poilll. at View has

blinded us and we cannot admit th, -

presence of tiilything' so intangible as

the Grinncli spirit," she said.

Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, director
of drama, spoke on the proposed
theater code and the effect it would
have on the little theater.

“It. would put out of business tbo‘
little theater that is devoted to the
art and not the industry of the the.- »
tor," she declared ,

The proLost against forcing the
little theater into this code s headed
by Mrs. Edith rsaacs, editor of the
Theater Arts magazmc, said Mrs.
Pryor, l

“The little theater is growuig up ,
in answer to the country's need {or -
recreation and creative cxpl'essmn,"
she concluded.

been exploded by tests made at the‘ ‘

The median score for athletes was,
78 and for non-athletes, 82. Till“
slight variation is due to the fact
that athletes study less, according to‘
