something like

that to

mellow

good tobaccos

HERE THE RARE WINES come
from they know that the two
most important things in wine-mak-
ing are the selection of the grapes
and the long years of ageing in the

wine cellars.

IT’S VERY MUCH THE SAME in
the making of a cigarette. You have

to get the tight

tobaccos, then put

them away to age and mellow in

wooden casks.

You Can’t make a good cigarette

like Chesterﬁeld

in a day. It takes

over two years to age the tobaccos
for'your Chesterﬁelds—but it adds
something to the taste and makes'

them milder.

Everything that modern Science
really knows about is used to
make Chestelﬁeld the cigarette
that’s milder, the cigarette that

tastes better.
