Cage Five Has
.533 Average
During Season

Teachers, Oklahoma, Drake|
Win One-Point Victories

to Lower Record

A total of six more points added
advantageously to the season score
of the Grinnell college basketball
team would have changed a season
of middling success into one of the
best that the Pioneers have enjoyed
for years But, those six points were
missing and, as a result, one point
defeats at the hands of Oklahoma A.
and M,, Drake and State Teachers
robbed the eager-s of much of their
descrved glory.

Despite these heartbreaking losses
which substituted 3 .533 record and
third place in the Valley conference
for the .733 record and tie for second
which might have been, the Pioneers
season of eight wins and seven losses
was far from disappointing.

Butler Game

When the cagers are tempted to
frown, upon remembering the defeat
handed them hy the lowly Aggies.
there will always be the memory of
that second Butler game to spread a
grin on their faces. And the 31-14
wallopiiig administered to Drake
Friday should he a sure antidote a-
gainst depression over the memory
of the unfortunate one—point defeat
earlier in the season.

The State Teachers,‘ also, were
duly avenged when the Pioneers
handed them a 30722 trouncing to
cancel the Tutors’ win in the season's
opener, The 35730 victory over Wash—
ington, after the Grinnell quintet
had trailed until the final two mi-
nutes, was another high spot which
will he long recalled with pleasure.

Another Chrnioe

With all of the 1934 regulars rec
turning, except Captain Santi and
Manns, the pioneers will have ample
opportunity next year to further a-
venge the wrongs dealt them this
season by the inconsiderate Cowboys.
Bulldogs and Tutors, and should
command much respect in Missouri
Valley circles.

Leading the list of those who will
be eligible next year are Mason, ou-
phant, Frye, and Bauer. all of whom
saw a great deal of service during
’tne past season. Mason and Frye
were both letter winners previous to
this year, out Cliphant and Bauer
are only sophomores and still have
two years of competition before
them.

Candidates

Besides the regulars, six other
members of the 1934 squad will be
eligible next season. DuMont, Klep-
fer and Morgan all were used fre-
quently this year, while Bradley, Mc-
Cully, and McFarlin developed appre-
ciably during the season.

This number may he augmented
by sevérul men from the yearling
squad. Fowler, guard, and McMul-~
ray, forward, were outstanding mem»
bers of the prep cagers end are most
likely to make the varsity Squad
next year.

The method of preparing Granger

like any other met/Md now in use.

Just about the 72mm?

thing to a pouch that a
package could be—it keeps
the tobacco the way you
want it.

A sensible package—100.

So far as we know, it is

Granger owes its extra

The way Granger Tobac-

helps it to smoke cool and
last longer. Try it.
