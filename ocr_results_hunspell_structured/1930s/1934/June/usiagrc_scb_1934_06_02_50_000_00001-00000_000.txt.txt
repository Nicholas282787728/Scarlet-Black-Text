with such success and popular favor
that officials in charge of the ninth
annual Central Intercollegiate out—
door track and field championships in
the Marquette university

lish the colorful features of the 1935

the Central Intercollegiate will go

pic games, All finals will be held at
night beneath the Marquette stadi-
um floorllights, focussed so that spec-
tators may see the start, running and
finish of every race. Night track has
proved popular in Milwaukee, but
next Friday's program is expected
to set a new high for the sport in
this section.

Twentysevch schools have defi-
nitely entered the meet, and Jennings
is confident that last year's list of 16

kee next Friday, although Griririell

“Since it is after the close of the
school year and the team members
havc all been busy with final exami—

Dawson), and her three brothers, Ma-
no (Robert Polachek), Amillo (James
Coddiugton), and Pepe (Robert M.
Brown).

To quote from Elisa Curtis, assist-
ant professor of Spanish, “These three
brothers are Spanish prototypes of
three young Americans eager to see
‘Lhe world, While Rosario, declaring
her desire for a latch key and a new
freedomito come and go as her
brothers doisuffers from the Samar
strong desire: that Amelieall girls of
like age and temperament feel, Even
the gay grandmother, who boasts of
three husbands whom she has loved
‘and plagued to death, might easily be
‘found among modern American
grandmothers, who keep up with the
times and refuse to grow old."
