THE YALE ”COLLEGE PLAN"

The educational systcln at Yale university will
undergo a radical change next fall when tlle uni-
versity will place its “college plai into final ef-
fect. The plan calls for the establishment of ten
colleges, each with a dormitory system, as a part
of the university. The colleges will be practically
self-contained, for each will include. be ties the
dormitories alld classrooms, a library, \lfCllel],
dining hall, and facilities for exercise.

The Yale plan of colleges and dormitories is
an indication of the growing conviction among
educators that the advantages of the Small unified
college make it far superior to large universities
which telld to become mere factories for the mass
production of candidates fol: degrees. It is hoped
that the Yale plan will combine the advantages of
the small college with the greater facilities and
opportunities for advanced study that the univer-
sity can offer.

Grinnell college has long been an advocate of
the smaller college, while the dormitory system
here is held up as a model thonghout the countryi
hence Grinnell interest in the Yale plan, and best
wishes for its success.

HARD AND FAST RULES

Since Grinncll is s '11 ill the infant stngc of
the comprehensive examination system, perhaps it
would be wise to e. pcriment a bit before adopting
ally hard aiid fast rules to govern in the future.
The reading period seems to be an integrnl and
necessary part of such all examination plan, and
should therefore be given the same careful trial
before final adoption.

At the time of the first reading period students
were allowed to use the time, if necessary, to get
ill back work or final reports, but the faculty has
seen fit to put a stop to this. All work, announced
the faculty committee recently, was to be handed
ill before the study period.

The chief object of the reading period, as one
noullccd, is to be a time of review. Perhaps anti-h-
ing up on laboratory work or papers during this
tilllc is not considered by instr ctors a. review, but
it seems to us that time spent ill doing such work,

along with otlloi‘ special rcnding suggested by tllc
faculty, wollld be vcry beneficial. Many students
are so rushed and t'l‘O\l(lCtl dn no the ldst Tow

We believe that waiters, even though they
work but seven days out of every fortnight for
hdlfehoard, arc putting ill enough time to warrant
receiving their meals during this ii-day period.
They do not average more than 2 minutes to each
meal that they eat. and the time that they spend
ill the dining rooms, including special dinner par-
ties and banquets, will average three hours a day
or more over any long period.

A ”BOOKLESS LIBRARY”

The college administrative llody might do well
to emulate the procedure of certain large chain
store operators who have introduced the “Dl'llgless
Drug Store,” by erecting ll “Backless Lib ."

The chain stores mentioned carry evc ,'thing
ill stock from lau‘ll-lllowcri lo picnic plates just
like any drug store except they have no prescrip-
tioll counters; similarly the “Booklcss Libe” might
have tables, chairs, lights, but no books. There,
the students wllo have no place else to go might
laugh, rlln about. shout across the room, alld (lisr
port themselves in other \va without disturbing
anyone who is trying to do a little intensive study
ing before examinations.

The librarians do as well as can be exp 'ted,
but no two or three people can keep order in a
room where many of the persons present have come
for the sole purpose of spending a social evening.

EDUCATION IN SOVIET RUSSIA

If there is anything which warms the cooliles
of John Dewey’s heart, it is the educational System
of Soviet Russia.

It has ever been John Dewey’s belief that our
education is too much concerned with the abstract,
with the ultural,’ and with disciplinary tcaclle
illg. The school, he llelicv ‘, so cty’s labora—
tor and should occupy itsclf: with materials
Wllltl‘l are used ill everyday life, and which are
concerned with such things as unemployment, pr -
ductioll, distribution, and other subjects of so ial
significance.

And the schools ill Russia, uhile certainly not
ideal are very lunch to Dr. Dewey’s liking, simply
beta '9 they have to a great extent fulfilled his
(her bed ideals. The Soviet schools are not for
the purpose of training the students to earn ‘a
livelihood after graduation, or to give them culr
turn, but to prepare them to take an integral part
ill Soviet society. In other words, education for the
good of: society as a whole.

There is one advantage which we have. The
students ill Russia cl-iti .c the instructor lnorci-
lcssly, especially if he happells to teach ai ‘thing
contrary to the philosophy of the state— In sill
and Leninisln, And if the teacher pcrs'sts ill his
"counter-rcvolutionary” alld “hourgeolsc” ins
structioll, he may find llinlselF ollt of a job—if not
on the carpet before the Gay~pay»oo, the political
police.
