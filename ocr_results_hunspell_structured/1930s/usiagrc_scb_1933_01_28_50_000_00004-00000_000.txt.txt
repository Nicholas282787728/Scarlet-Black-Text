Payne Calls Culture Side of Education
Distinguishing Feature of Grinnell,)

Cites Famous Grinnellians

in Recent Comments

on School

“Perhaps one of the most disting-
uishing features of Grinnell is the
fact that it places a particular ems
phasis on th humanistic or cultural
side of education.‘ stated Charles E.
Payne, professor of European History,
in an interview with a staff reporter.

“Besides the broad cultural back
ground which it provides," continued
Mr. Payne, "Grinnell has become
noted throughout the country as be-
ing unusually democratic. For ex-
ample, there is no distinction made
between the students who work their
way through school and those who
do not. in fact those who do help in
some way to earn their education are
greatly respected and have a much
better chance to develop than stu-
dents in some of the larger educa-
tional institutions where the same
tendencies do not exist."

Close Relationship

Mr. Payne noted another distinct

point in favor of Grinnell, He re-

dents and faculty, is great deal of in~
terest is manifested by the faculty
in outside affairs.

When asked concerning the oppor-
tunities available for Crinnell stu-
dents in the business and academic
world, he cited a number of Crinnell
graduates who have achieved consid.
erable fame, "Most students have
heard of Norman Hall, the disting—
uished writer, Then there is Raymond
Hare ’25, one of several former Gri -
nellians who now hold prominent po-
sitions in the Diplomatic service, and
Neil Crone who has done scientific
work at Oxford university in Eng-
land and who is now located at Her

named Nascn Ladd who is connected
with the law school at fowa City and

ment at the same place as outstand-

academic world.

Mr. Payne has spent considerable
time in Europe having studied at
Geneva in the fall of 1925 and at 0x-

Tonight a game worth going miles
to see will he played at the Drake
fieldhouse, the Bulldog team meeting
its old rival, Grinnell, in their first

encounter of the year. The tilt will be
none the less spectacular, despite the
fact that it will be a battle between
the two last place teams.

In the only other game in the con-

state rivals, Oklahoma, in a contest

Creighton Prepares
For Bulldogs

OMAHA, NebiFear of the deadly
grip of the Butler university Bull~
dogs, which must be encountered
Monday, has sent the Creighton uni-
flutter-ing to the
rafters of the Creighton gym during
the past week, in spite of the best
lefforts of Coach A. A. Schabinger
i‘who has piloted his teams to Missouri
'vailey conference basketball suprem-
acy during three of the four years
Creighton has held membership in
the loop.

With the Bulldogs on the scene this
year for the first time, however,
Creighton’s reign seems destined for
an abrupt termination, And for the
first time in many seasons, Creigh-
ton will enter a conference basket-
ball game doped to lose.

Comparative records give Coach
Tony Hinklc‘s Indianapolis cagers a
decided edge, and should enable their.
to maintain indiana's vaunted repur
tation as the heart of the basketball
world.

applause, but several times a faint

yearlings in occasional flashes of
