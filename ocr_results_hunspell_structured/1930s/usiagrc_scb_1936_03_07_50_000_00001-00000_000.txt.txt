Final College Game
Last Night.

Five Grinnellians

By Max Hunn

A desperate last minute rally
narrowly failed, and a battling
Grinnell five went down in defeat
before an erratic Drake team in
the Pioneers final game of the
season here last night by a margin
of 37735.

The Drake victory throws the
Missouri valley col‘ifercncc bas-
ketball title into a three way tie
between the Bulldogs, the Creigh»
ton Bluejays and Oklahoma Ag»
gies, the latter two closing their
seasons earlier in the week.

Bradley Starts

Coach Truesdale reached into his
bag of tricks .to spring two sur»
prises, one in returning Bauer to
the lineup, and the other in start-
ing Bradley at one of the guard
berths, from where he accounted
for six points.

Grinnell led 13- -2 at one time dur-
ing the first 10 minutes, only to
lose it at 16 all and to trail 24- 20
at the half. The Pioneers led onccl
in the second half, 26 to 23.

Last Game ,

For the starting five in the

Grinneli lineup, oliphant, Bauer,

McMur-rsy, Klepfer and Bradley,

it was their last game under the
scarlet and black colors.

The game started slowly with
both teams playing cautious bail.
ci-inneii jumped into an early lead
with a quick scoring spurt, which
saw Klepfcr drop in two buckets,
one a left-handed hook, and the
other a short follow. Parisho
opened the Drake scoring a mo-
ment later by dropping in a char»
ity toss on Oliphant's foul.

If You Can Meet These Requirements, Girls,
You Shouldn’t Become Fair Spinsters

 

Intelligence, attractiveness and
good cooking were the prime
qualities desired in a wife by Grin-
ncll men according to the results
of a recent interview of 48 college
men on the subject of "What I
want my wife to be like."

Three sets of questions were
used in the interview. The first
group dealing with intelligence,
beauty, personality, and a good
sense of humor. The second

igroup dealt with seriousness and

light-heartedness, and the third
set asked the men whether they

Personality Important

Personality was listed as the
most important qualification from
the first set, with intelligence,
beauty, and a good sense of hu-
mor following in'order. 0f the
men interviewed, 32 per cent ad-
judged personality as the most es»
scntiai, 26 per cent voted for in-
telligence, 23 per cent for beauty,
and 19 per cent for a good sense
of humor.

In the second group of questions,
[every man demanded that his wife

be both serious and light-hearted
instead of having only one of these
attributes.

The third set of questions re-
vealed that either there arc no
gentlemen on the Grinnell campus,
or the old adage that "gentlemen
prefer blondes" is a misleading
aphorism, because only four of the
48 men interviewed wanted a
blonde wife while 20 desired a bru-
nette. Toe color of hair made no
difference to 24 husbands-to-he,
