NEEDED RECREATION FACILITIES

The opening of the recreation room ill the

quadrangle for the entertaining of men guests will

‘ comeias fr very welcome addition to Grillnell col-
lege life. The adding of a ping-pong table and card
tables will make it a place where men may be ell»
tertained in a more home-like atmosphere than is
found in the cottage parlor .

Reserving the use of the recreation room for
women on weekend nights will furnish various
forms of amusement for the girls wllo do not date.
Rather than spending the evenings of the week-
end camped in solitary state ill their own rooms,
the girls can enjoy themselves at home.

It cannot be urged too strongly that thc stu~
dent body make use of this recreation center pro-
vided by the faculty. Since any suggestion for
additions and improvements is welcome, there
should he at least one game that each student will
cn'o la in . l

J y P y g
DANCE TOURNAMENT

At; just the moment when all unified interest
in college activities seemed at its lowest ebb nearly
150 women combined their talents to successfully
put over the intramural dance tournament. It was
well attended and the repeated outbul'. ts of one
thusiastic applause give us reason to question the
prevalent talk despairing thc campu. ,pi

That there were many disappointed With the
judges’ decisions is not so great a reflection on
ethe ability of the judges to choose what secmod the
host pcl'fornlallc s as it was that every woman
was charged witll d fervid desire to will at lailll
for her cottage.

To be sure, Thursday night’s show was a fine
exhibition of forgotfullless of self interest to en-
hance the prestige of the cottage. For this the
women are to be commended.

Although it call llot positively be said that the
judges erred in their decisions, it is known that
there ls a wide difference ill opinion ill some in
stances. Rather than place tllis blame on the judges,
it would seem better to go to the true source for
the blame.

The capability of the judges is not to he doubts
ed but tlle system of judging these contests is to
be questioned.

Points are awarded to the cottages for tho
number of wolncll participating. On that basis the
cottage with the largest number of par pants is
entitled to first place. However, points are also
awarded for originality in production, adaptation
to music, composition and presentation. This all
concerns the aggregate but there is no method of
g'i ing recognition to individual performance. Two
individuals that won greatest applause from the
audience last night were almost completely ineffec-
tive ill placing their cottage among the winners.

All attempt should be made to remedy this
inconsistency ill judging that the tournament might
enjoy‘a like success next year. It was the greatest
show that has hit this campus since the 1930 Pior
ncer Prudities and deserves enthusiastic applaus

THE CAT'S FUR

The cat’s fur still flies over the llo-dcc' ion
debate issue. It seems ridiculous that any rcsls -
auc should be put up against the inauguration of
doc ion debates ill the Grillllcll varsity schcdulc
but some of the dic-hards are still fighting against
the proposal.

That decision debates will affect the spcaltcrs’
pleasing delivery, clcar thinking, cogent reasoning,
and convincing appeal does not hardly seem proh-
able to us. If anything, the increased attendance
at these dcbatos should enhance the spcakcrs’ dc-

'c to improve in these details.

The vcly admission of the opponents of ties
clsion dobatcs in saying that the aim of winning
decisions has its place ill intercollegiate debating
should have terminated the battle, but it didn’t
and we are still fighting for what we think the
student body Wants. G

The greatest aid to the progress of ally com-
munity is the funeral of the man who blocks it.

Already prominent bl illcss loaders and count»:

llowcl'cr, either rapid recovery or complete

If the l-ccovcl , route is taken, a. governing

tion of high pressure gasses. And here we find ours
selves helpless and without the slightest conception
of what kind of governing agent can best be adap~

Four long years now we have gropcd our way

he is entitled to a vacation until the machine is

ANSWER THAT PHONE!

Drapillg ollc’s sle over a Wall phone \v itillg
for an answer is no pleasant task and certainly
tries the patience of a man to the very lilllit. If
any girl senses a harsh llotc ill her male communr
cant’s v cc, such a condition may be blamed upon
the irlltatiug delay in responding to his ring.

Perhaps a woman’s intuition is so keen that
she can always know when the phone call is for
llel',,l)ut even tllell she is not very much excited
judging from the delayed response to the oper-

. ator’s ring.

This laxity ill responding to a telephone call

ill the quadrangle is becoming intolerable. We beg
of the women to either have a heart or prepare
for an organized boycott.

COLLEGIANA LOOKS AT THE LEADER
(The Creiglltoniun)

During the next four years, almost the entire per-
sonnel of coueglana will be graduated into the rank and
file of life, into the turmoil that is modern business.

It is important, therefore, that collegiana should
take a deep interest in any changes in the life which are
made in the meantime, especially any changes in the
leadership which will be at the head of this nation when
the university students of the land step into its business
to seek a living.

Last Saturday, Franklin Delano Roosevelt became
the 32nd president of the United States of America. The
economic turbulence intu w ich Mr. Roosevelt stepped
from the hole of private Ci am to the head of the great-
est nation in the world is best illustrated by the fact that
on the very morning he took the oath of office, banks in
44 of the 48 states of the Union were Closed for a three-
day holiday. The attitude of this new leader in the midst
of such conditions is one that should be of utmost. in-
Lezcst to collegians.

Stepping off on the right foot, Mr. Roosevelt ignor-
ed generalities to hit. at the Core of the nation’s distress
as he said in his inaugural address: " . . . there must
be an end to speculation with other people's money

Courageously and fearlessly stepping into the very
center of the greatest economic upheaval since the in-
dustrial revolution, the new president demanded that if
the Congress of the United States failed to enact the
particular measures which he would propose to them to
bring the country out of its economic chaos. he would
then demand broad executive power so that he himself
could take the necessary steps: t' . . as great as the
power that would be given to me if we were in fact
invaded by a foreign foe.” ‘ ‘

Talk is only too cheap. Words do not accomplish
anything, but from the promise of this new executive as
he takes over his post there is reason to believe that the
nation has a real leader, a man, and one who will fulfill
the office of president to the very best of his proven
capabilities: one who will, if there is a physical possibili'.
ty, lead the nation from its economic distress and set it
once again upon the road to permanent prosperity, if
there be such a thing at all,

Collegiana should welcome the new leader. The “new
idea" looms on the horizon after a long period of dis-
tress. There’ll be no shuffling in this deal. Let the cards
fall. More power to the dealer: ‘

AN HONEST ERROR
(The Daily Northwestern)

In 1927 and 1923 the middle class and ricn were
looking about for profitable investments to get rid of
their surplus incomes. There was, in other words. a
great demand for someone to borrow the money they
could not use. With the generosity of bankers the Na-
tional City company in New York underwrote $90,000,000
of Peruvian bonds.

These bonds offered at llll/2 to successful doctors,
lawyers, professors, writers, divorcees and widows. All
were happy until the credit balloon burst in October,
1929. The bonds, now defaulted. are quoted at seven
or eight.

The issue of these bonds, although the company had
been warned of the precarious condition of Peruvian
finance, was called an "honest error."

How honest the error was can be understood from
the revelation made to the senate committee that a
$400,000 gift was made to the son of Peru‘s president.

only because investment is not regulated and re-
stricted can such an "error" occur.

Charlton Calls
Technocracy
Fleeting Fad

"As a fleeting fad, technoeracy has
been given wide publicity, and is now
meeting a. quick death because of
its unsound claims,” declared Joseph
W. Charlton, associate professor of
economies, in his talk at the Work—
ers’ Cooperative college Wednesday
night.

“Technooracy,” be continued, “an
organization of economists lead by
Howard Scott, believes that America
should be ruled by engineers, and that
the price system, because it is un~

is measured by energy,” pointing out
the limitations of the scheme.
Professor Charlton concluded by
saying that “technochracy has done
some good, in so far as it has dra»
matized the failings of technological
unemployment, the Mmsis of modern
industry.
