Pioneers Play Drake Bulldogs

At Des Moines Friday Night

Grinnell Raied
Second Choice
By Dope Books

Drake stadium, Friday eve-
ning, will be the scene of the
renewal of a gridiron rivalry
between Drake and Grinnell that
dates back to 1896. in the 44
contests that the two teams have
played, the Bulldogs hold a decide
ed edge with 29 victories as
against 15 won by the Pioneers.
Two games ended in ties.
Grinnell has not tasted victory
since 1932 when the Pioneers won
7 to o. If one is to judge by
predictions and performances of
the two teams this season, Pio-
neer supporters will have little
to cheer at the conclusion of the
game.
Lookabnugh Dissatisﬁed.
Following the lacing taken from
Carleton last Friday, Coach Guy
Lookabaugh asserted that he was
very much dissatisfied with the
play of me team. On the other
hand. Coach Vee Green of Drake
could not help but be happy with
the performance of his Bulldogs

against Kansas.
At approximately the same time
that a fleet hall carrier named
Raiter was scampering through
the Grinneil line, the Drake Bull~
dogs were upsetting the dope buc-
ket with a well»earned 12 to E
victory over the Jayhawkcrs.

Bulldogs Overpower Kansas. .

Making six first downs to Ram
5215' three and gaining 224 yards
to the Jayhawkers' 52, the Bulk
dogs revealed a fast line and
shifty backfield that seems to
have all of the punch and power
of the strong Drake eleven of
last year.

In Harvey and Fisher, Drake
has two backs that may well tear
open the Grinnell defense in a
manner that will make Pioneer

“Stoop, prep!" and ten timid but
militant freshmen immediately
drop their books, grab their fore-
heads with one hand and their
skirts with the other and drop a
decidedly gauche curlseyior as:

How do you know they are

Reserve books will be returned
by 7:59; mail will be mailed and
laundry bags sent, and all under

benighted babes who entered coir

Monday Marks Fall of Two Crinnell
Voluntary Chapel, Dibble- Clark Feud

Traditions:

Discontinued

 

By Ken Mathews.

Like the advent of fascism in
italy one day in the early twen-
ties, Mmiday was an epochal day
in Grinnell history. Amazed stu-
dents saw the downfall of not
one. but two of Grinnell’s time-
honored traditions.

First, custom cast into the pit
of oblivion was Grinnell's volun-
tary chapel program, when the
Honor “a" club made attendance
at the daily services compulsory
for all freshmen.

The final shock for old stu-
dents came late that evening
when Dibble and Clark halls for-
mally and seriously buried the
hatchet to their long standing
inter-hall feud, With the earlier
drastic developments of the day,

 

the scene of Dibble hall singing
its song in Clark's clubroom with
the Clark men politely applaud<
ing was merely the climax to the
activities of Grinnell's “red"
Monday.

Despite the Clark hall redeco-
ration program, finished by un-
known campus derelicts today,
the consensus of opinion of both
the halls seems to be that it was
definitely an outside job, inde-
pcndent of the Dibble-Clark little
entente.

This last news of the day, we
are assured by both house coun-
cils involved, is more than an
armistice a la Hitler. It is true
that the pact was not brought
about by a mutual desire for

namely, the suspension of both
hall's social privileges until an
agreeable settlement had been
reached. won an easy victory.
Off hand we can still recall
three Grinnell traditions left
standing. but we wonder how
long it will be before Prof. K.
Keyser's radio program will make
the smoking of cigarettes the ac-
cepted thing in the library Prob-
ably we will have to wait for the
building of a new men’s gym be
fore the taboo on dates at the
basketball games will perish. Al-
ready, we have it on reliable an;
thority. that the senior class in
the quad, which outnumbers the
male seniors two to one. is work
ing on a plan to abolish fresh-

peace. but official compulsion,,man prep caps.
