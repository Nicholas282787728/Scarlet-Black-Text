Four-way ties seem to be getting
more and more popular in local intra-
mural competition. Now kittenhall
has ended up in a quadruple tie just
as water polo did, It's getting to be a
habit.

With Tulsa and Washbuhn joining
the Missouri Valley conference things
is anchored by LuValle, national in-
peciaiiy when the teams make a
southern trip. No more games on suc—
cessive nights, which should appeal
to the cagers to no little extent.

Plenty of speed is promised Satur-
day when fifteen sprinters, all of
whom have done between :09.4 and
:09.s in the hundred, clash at the
Drake relays. The field is led by Met-
calfe of Marquette who has paced the
hundred in :09.4.

'Safris' drive which went for a
home run in the Gates—Dibble game
Saturday had the distinction of being
one of the few home runs ever hit
through four fielding positions. it
was hit on the ground through the
box, past the short center fielder, and
past the regular center fielder, while
five men were frantically trying to
.get their hands on the ban.

The only extra inning game of the
kittenball season was played last Sat-
urday moming between Smith and
Clark, The game was finally won in
eight innings by Clark, despite a
homer by Dick Brown, Smith, in the
first extra session.

The batteries in the lrittenhall com-
petition seem to be unusually out-
standing this year with nearly every
team featuring good pitching and
fine receiving behind the plate. The
defensive play, however, was very
ragged at times and to a large extent
offset the stellar pitching.

The Missouri Valley track meet,
which will he held in Des Moines May
19, may see Tulsa making its debut
as a member of the conference.
while it is not assured that it will
appear in the track competition it is
certain that both new members will
enter active competition during the
193445 basketball season.

of their one-act play, along with two
others, in the iittle theatre Thursday

to see established a collegiate custom
which will bring back memories of
the famous “Speedy" tap-dance of
introduction which was instigated
some years ago by Harold Lloyd.
