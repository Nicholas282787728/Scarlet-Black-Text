WELCOME—FAREWELL

One commencement issue of The Scarlet and
Black sccins scarcely adequate to serve ‘for a weir
come to visiting alumni and ft farewell to graduat-
ing seniors. ,

That both students and faculty members r .
glad to see alumni is patent. One Grinllellian is
always glad to grect another, In returning this
ycar, risitors will possibly ﬁnd more changes than
at most colnlnenceillellt gatherings. A new presi-
dent has the reins of Griilncll, but he is well known
to alumni through his service to the college. There
have been liliuor alterations in Grinnell, also, A
change ill the grading system, more effective stu-
dent government, and the usual changing student
body greets visitors, Through it all, however. there
is the realization that it is Griilllell, where no
change can be great enough to alter alumni senti-
ment. _.
As for the seniors, they will be missed next
year, but meanwhile students must congratulate
their older schoolmates on going to bigger ﬁelds
following their days of collegiate lriurcls. The class
of 1931 has been remarkably outstanding in the
work of the students here. They have inaintiliuod
sensational scholastic standings while taking HOLT
ivc parts ill activities. The, group as a whole con-
tributed more than its share of men toward the
athletic glory of the college. Speech, drama, journ-
alism, music, and all other fields will find pl; cs
hard to ﬁll as the seniors leave. Success should
greet thorn in life. G .

A POSSIBLE SOLUTION

The freshmen, like the poor, are always pres
am. There has never been a fully satisfactory solu-
tion of their problem. Tllc cap-burning ceremony
and some of the events that accompanied it have
aroused the old question, “Whose business is prep-
ping?”

Since it has the prep cap concession, the Honor
Gr club has taken an rictive port ill prepping. Wheth-
er or not the right has been given to the group in
black and white is impertincnt, for zi ﬁrmly estnb»
lishcd tradition passes for law.

But is the Honor G at the present time the best
possiblc organization to direct freshman tradition.
Probably not. Sillcc freshman customs are” so close-
1y bound up with discipline, they ought to he in
tllc hands of bodies of a less private nature than
this athletic organization is. The prestige of the
Honor G is such that thc members might very
wisely be retained to administrate fr 'llmal] cere-
monies, such a. 'lpburlliiig, however. even if the
planning of tho (3 events wcl'c done by other bodies.

A customs committee has been successfully om-
ploycd at other institutions to dczll with prcppi
and it ought to be especially useful ill Grinnoll
collcgc. A body with two members from the oouiicl
of house chilii-mrcll rind two men from the stu‘ cut
council lilight hi: tllc thing. Tho ( . ipliilhry . lo
is the llll. ucu wllilo all came

pus traditions and relations with the administra-

tion belong to thc student council.

IS IT A DIRGrE‘7

“A Dir , For ('ollcgc Liberalism” is the title
of an article in ii rcccllt no of the New Rr‘public,
It as written by William Thu-loll Hale, o senior at
Yale university who contends (hut youthful enthuse
iosm is dead with only the chant, funeral proces-
sion and the burial remaining.

To the close observer this is probably true. The
college has born at birthplace of mmly grout rc-
fol'ins and ill fill a cs the students have been known
for their liberal in and insurgency. Yet Gl‘lllnt‘ll
college is today. just as llcnrly all others, zi placid
spii-itlcss body of students who attend classes,
study, dance. and watch football games.

fight, tuc rallies wore attempted lit Yale, both of
which turned out to be “disluill fiascoe. ” There is
no interest in searching- for leaders rather than
illochillcs,

“Debuting societies in large eastern colleges ‘

hav eprut‘tically ccnscd to exist,” writes the Yale
senior. If Grillilcll is an example of smaller illstitu~
tioils, that statement can easily bo augmented to
includr virtually every college in the count 5'.
\Vllctllcr or not this is a defect ill the twentieth
century mind, presumably grippcd by gl ss lllﬂ'
tm'inlislu, or a lJl‘mldt’i‘ sense of tolerance iii which
quillllliug is not tolel'utcd, is a point which is not
St‘ltlt‘d.

According to Mr. llulc, the cnllcgo clithusinsul
deprc on (wteuds into other channels. “Sonic-

convention i one of the chief chhrnctoristics of to
day’s collcgmu.

The faculties in most institutions are c mplcs
of the spiritual lethargy which exists thelc. Grill-
llcll’s faculty differs in that it is willing to g' c
iumiy liberal experiments a trial The student "ow
orumcut here and ill? recent nltciotiou in the g 1d-
iug system are examples of that. The group is
probably guilty of acting as it restraining force
upon the student mind its a whole, however, by
frowning upon suggested innovations,

College publications are fair indications of
this conservatism. The Scarlet and Block depicts
the extent to which Grinnell students acquiesce.
Alcrt editorial voices are calmly sidetracked by
the editor. College athletics are over emphasized
and controversial subjects are meticulously avoided.

Mr, Hole has gone over the surface carefully,
He has enumerated college reactions and has or
rived at a likely conclusion. The lack of college
insurgency might mean a step toward more toler-
ance, however. After all, t might be a step for-

A LESSON IN COLLEGE
(From the industrial Collegian)

It has often been remarked that if four years in col~
lege did nothing else than impart a sense of responsib
ity as a part of a Student's ethical code, it would have
accomplished a great deal.

Too often attention is centered on the "one who doesn't
care,m or the “happy-go-lucky~type." Such a person is
great fun, and is usually the life of the party, but even
his friends never call on him for aid in tirne of emerg-
ency. Not because he isn't clever or capable, simply be-
cause he isn't dependable. After his little jokes and irre~
sponsihilities have grown stale, the quality of stability is
lacking.

Then there is the type who rushes enthusiastically in
to everything—for the first. few days, then basks in the
credit given him while someone else does his work. Also
there is his twin brother who manages to get on every
committee and nev‘er goes to a meeting,

But for every one of the "Independables," there is be~
ing developed during a, college course two who plod
along, who can he depended upon for every emergency.
And it is to these, who work in obscurity while their
charmingly irresponsible companions hold the center of
the stage and receive all the publicity, that we should
salute and say "well done," when they complete their
four years here and step up to take a more responsible
place in the world.

‘G—
THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
(From the mayene)

The recent announcement that several of the fratern-
ities on the campus are planning to experiment with the
tutorial system next ‘year should be of interest to the
entire college. The plan under consideration by several
Iocal chapters is similar to that in vogue at British uni-

versities and at many American institutions. It pro-
vides thata college graduate of high scholarship and
proveu general ability will live in the fraternity house
and will encourage higher scholarship in the chapter. At
the same time be will be enabled to do graduate work
at the college in any department he selects. The college
administration is cooperating with fraternities in this
project by offering free tuition to the recipient of the
position. The fraternity will provide the other expenses.

It must be admitted that it is high time the fraterlm
has provided some constructive plan to produce 3, better
grade oi scholarship in their groups. Prominent educat—
ors are practically unanimous in predicting 3 quick death
for fraternities if this problem is not dealt with success
fully. This plan should tend to provide a close relation-
ship between college men and a man who has success-
fully completed his college eourse. The method of se-
lection will guarantee the selection of a mall well quali-
fied in the matter of scholarship. Similar plans have
been Successful wherever tried. There seems little rea-
son why this one shou1d not work at Lafayette.

The only valid argument against the system seems to
be the possibility of employing a man who would not
be able to gain the sympathy of the under-graduates.
The only guard against this is a careful compilation of
all data obtainable about the candidate, As long as the
houses take these precautions this problem can easily be
solved.

No matter how the system turns out, however, the
project must certainly be regarded as an indication of a
healthy attitude on the campus toward intellectual mac
tars. Finally. the confidence the administration has
shown in the plan should guarantee the students that
they can always be sure of its interest and cooperation
in any constructive plan concerning the development of
the college.

Dear Sir:

Moved with the same spirit of en— ﬂoor of Chicago ha“,

thusiesm that prompted the pajama

taken, that no malice was intended.
and that it was far from our thoughts
and desires to do bodily injury or to

Very truly yours.

A student told the registrar that he
was leaving school because he had

none of them would cut his hair right.
