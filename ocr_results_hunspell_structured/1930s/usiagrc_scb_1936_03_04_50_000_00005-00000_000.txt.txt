Holch Lost
to Tank Squad

Drops Swimming Because
of Skin Infection

Sam Holcn, carcaptain of the
varsity swimming team, win be
lost to the squad for the remain-
der of the season, it was an-
nounced yesterday,

Because of a. chronic skin in-
fection, which has become irrir
tated by the chlorine in the water,
Holch was advised by his doctor
to abandon swimming for the rest
of the year. He has been taking
treatments during the past tew
months, but has not been able to
cure the infection, which will re-
main inctu-eble as long as he
swims, according to his doctor.

“The loss of l-loich, the only
letterrnan back this year, will be
keenly felt, especially in the next
meet with Nebraska here Sature
day nigh " Coach Frank Luorne.
said yesterday, “The team will
be weakened in the dash events,
and the loss practically wrecks
any hopes of victory in the re-
maining meets."

Two home meets will be held
within the next week, according
to Luoma Saturday the team
will meet the University of Ne-
braska tanlcsters, which on Tue?
day afternoon, the Washington
Bears will appear here. This meet
was originally scheduled for Feb.
22, but was postponed because the
St. Louis swimmers could not get
here then.

the Bulldogs gain revenge latcr in
the season, when the Misouri Val-
ley title was at stake, by Winning
the encounter at Des Moines 4124
in a rough encounter.

Gl‘inncll's chances of a Victory
Seem bright, With advantages of
playing on the home floor and
the possibility of Bauer partici—
pating. Another angle giving
Pioneer fans hope is the fact that
Drake has not made the showing
that pro-season dope predicted.
The Bulldogs now occupy the third
place position in the valley standr
ing behind Creighton and
Oklahoma A. & M. places.

clared, Johnson will almost cer—

he has had enough competition
this year. However, he stated,
if Nelson does as well as he did
in the Drake duel, considering the
amount of real practice he has
had this year, it will probably be
a four or five way tie for first.
