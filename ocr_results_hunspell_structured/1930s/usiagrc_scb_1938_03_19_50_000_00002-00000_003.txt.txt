“What cigarette
do the tobacco
growers smoke

themselves?”

“Camels— by a large
majority? say planters
who lm_0W_ the kinds
of tobacco bought by
each popular cigarette

T, N. Williams,
well-known grow.
er, or Winchester,
Kentucky, says:
“A planter lcvlolvs
tobacco. My last
crop was the best
I ever had and the Camel people
bought my best lear tobacco. There
isn’t any question where the more
expensive tobaccos go. They're in
Grand cigar-cues"

“I'm a planter,"
says Vertner Hat.

grown tobacco for
25 years. “Camel
bought: the best
lear tobacco of my
last crop. Paid a high price for my
ﬁnest grades, I smoke Camels. I
know thcrc isn't any substitute for
more expensive tobaccos."

Top prices, that's
what J. E. Jackson,
successful planter,
cot irom the Camel
buyer last year. .7 .
“Camel buyers don’t IX /, -
buy just (my tobacco ll 2“
ithey pay more to get the best.
That means ﬁner tobaccos are
used for Camels. I say quality has
got to be grown in tobacco. That’s
why I smoke Camels."

“It's a fact Hint
Camel uses cost-
lier tobaccos,"

from the lzround up. “Last year I

that [goes into them."
