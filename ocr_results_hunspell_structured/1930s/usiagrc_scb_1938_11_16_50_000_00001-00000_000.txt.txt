Lookabaugh Drives
Team Hard; Right
End Remains Open

By Clarlt A. Smith.

Thirteen senior squadmcn will be
dressing for their final intercol-
legiate football game Saturday
after-noon when the Pioneers meet
Colorado college -

on Ward field. Of
these men. nine
were letterxnen
and have served

the scarlet and
black colors
through a hard
campaign marked _
with misfortune
and defeat.

Heading the list
of ‘eniors is Capt. Lookabaugh
Burke Powers who for three
years has played brilliant football
at end, despite his meager 155
pounds What Powers has lacked
in weight he has made up for in
fight and leadership.

Drives Charges Fast.

The other men are Lester Shep~
and, Fred Homann, Fred Luther,
Paul Baichly, Ray Crossmao, Wil-
liam Fort, Vern Robinson, Harold
High, Robert Moehl, George
Tompkins. Howard True and Ed-
ward Vaughn.

Atfer last week's disappoint—
ment at Coe, Coach Guy Looks.»
baugh is driving his charges at a
faster pace this week in hopes
of winding up the season with an
intersectional victory over the
Colorado Springs team.

Works on Passing Attack.

The passing attack will draw
particular attention in as much
as out of 19 tosses attempted
against the Kohawks, only three
were completed, two of which
were short shovel passes.

Lookabaugh feels that if more
completions had been made in the
aerial game, the Coe contest
might have been a different story.
Luther probably Out.

The punting department of the
Grinnell backield will also he re-
ceiving attention this week. as
it plainly showed bad effects from
the lay off enforced by the bad
weather preceding the Armistice
Day contest.

Fred Luther, the Pioneer open
field threat, probably played his
last college game as his injured
knee will keep him out of the
Colorado college contest. Paul
Baichly, recuperating from an in—
fected cut, will definitely not see
service Saturday, Ray Crossman
is suffering from bruises in the
Kohawk battle. and Lookabaugh
is afraid that he also will be un-
ahlc to play.

End Positions a Question.

The rest of the squad is in
good condition and anxious to
wind up the season with a victory,
Only at the end posi ion, shared
by Crossrnan and Baiehly, is the
Pioneer forward wall not Set,

Howard True, Marvin Jorgen-
scn, Donald Niffencgger, Carl
Blank and Robert Riedel are all
being considered as possibilities
for that post,

AS to who will start in the
backfield is also a problem for
the coaching staff.

Leaviil Finds Modern
Religious Beliefs Vital

“it is rather vital to look into the
trends of modern religious think-
ing," the Rev. Ashley Day Lea—
lvitt said Tuesday morning at the
first of a series of Gates lectures.

He added that. to begin with,
there is the assertion that we
are in a way of making progress
in religious matters and that
|there is a crisis all about us. ,

However. any crisis that is too
prolonged ceases to be one and
becomes a condition under which
men live and grow.

"All writers and readers use
the idea of a great crisis as the
preface of their material and so
interpret conditions all over the
world.

"We accept the crisis series,"

When asked what students or-

place of business, one proprietor
suggested ash trays, another; ‘
water, and a third said they or-
dci'ed coffee and glued their eyes
on the rolls as they drank it.

Aside from these frivolities, we
collected the following data—list-
ed in order of consumption: cof-
fee, coca cola, breakfast rolls,
hamburgers, cinnamon toast, milk,
hot chocolate, sandwiches, candy-

Petition Presented.

According to Robert Moehl.
president of the student govem-
ing body, dances at the White
House on Friday night will be
discontinued at the end of three
weeks if they prove unsuccessful.

At its regular weekly meeting
last night, the council was pre-
sented with a petition, carrying
430 names of students in favor
of continuing the Friday night
dances at the White House. The
petition was presented by Ed-
ward Vaughn, town men's council
representative.

Committee’s Viewpoint.

Nancy McMurray, chairman of
the White House committee, read
a letter. giving the committee's
point of view, and was followed
by Vaughn, who read arguments
on the petition.

Miss McMurray asked that a
vote be taken of either yes or no
as to whether the Student Coun-
cil would support the White
House committee.

Heated Argument.

Argument became heated until
Vaughn suggested a compromise
as to giving the town men's or-
ganization a month‘s trial in holds
ing Friday night dances and as—
sured the council that the name
of “Town Men's Open House"
would no longer be used. but
would be substituted by a name
which will act as a welcoming
sign for all students on the cam-
pns.

Miss McMuri-ay refused to ac-
ocpt this compromise, stating that
the council should either support
the committee or the town m'cn's
organization.
