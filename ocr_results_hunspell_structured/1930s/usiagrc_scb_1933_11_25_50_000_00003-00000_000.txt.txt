for Presentation of Sonata Recital

Aggies Clinch

Program Includes Numbers
by Brahms, Beethoven
Schubert, Bach

(By H. \v. Matlack)

Most important and most serious of
all modern forms of music are sona-
tas, for a solo instrument with piano,
or piano alone, and their big broth-
ers. the orchestral symphonies. Cone
Sequently the composition of success-
ful sonatas or symphonies is the test
of a composer; the successful per-
formance of a sonata is a test of the
performer. and the intelligent hear-
ing of a sonata is a test of the audi-
ence, To present a program consist-
ing entirely of sonatas is a Self-im—
posed test which few musicians care
to assume. It is also the highest
possible compliment which can be
paid to an audience.

on behalf of the audience, there-
fore. thanks are due Professors Mne-
Donald and Peck. pianist and violi -
ist of our own faculty, for their high
estimate of our ability as listeners
to four sonatas in a l'ow. The ap-
plause which greeted the artists
abundantly proved the sincerity of
our appreciation.

Program Skilfuuy Built

From beginning to end enthusiasm
kept mounting Enthusiasm amply
merited, in the first place. for the way
the programhad been skilfully built
up from the simple little formal so»
nata of Each to the exuberant revela-
tion of personality in Bl'ath' sonata
written a century and a half later.
In the second place, for the solid mu<
siicanship which faces the toughest
problems in performance and inlet»
pretation and solves them finally and
completely; and in the third place for
the dignity, charm. and power of the
artists, showing through every meESv
ure of their highly integrated per-
formance.

In spite of the fact that every in-
strumental program offered at Grin.
hell for many years has contained a
sonata. the mystery that seems to
surround that term still prevails.
Musicians do know. and non-musi-
cians should know, that the word "so—
nata" means an instrumental compo-
sition of several parts or movements.
normally four in number.

Movements Explained

The character of each movement
is generally established as follows:
"The first movement, called “allegro.”
is vigorous and robust. The second
movement, “andante” or "adagio," is
slow. songlike. romantic. and tender;
the third movement is brisk, excit-
ing. with delicate contrasts. and in
vivid rhythm. but Chopin and Bee-
thoven went to an opposite extreme,
and occasionally made the third
movement a dirge. The fourth move-
ment is a brilliant finale. often with
echoes of the previous movements.

Des Moincs, Inﬂiw'lth the Missouri
valley football title once again stored
away in Oklahoma Aggie vaults, the
Conference season will be wound up
today and on Thanksgiving- Day with
three colorful games involving tra-
ditional rivals.

Today Drake of the Missouri Val—
ley. second place winner this year.
entertains Iowa state in the Bulldog-
homecoming. The Cyclones and
Drake always provide a thrilling
game and this year's affair promises
to be close.

On Thanksgiving Washington and
St. Louis battle it out for the supre-
macy of the Missouri metropolis. A
Bear victory would give the Missouri
Valley eleven a good claim to the
state college title, since last week it
walioped the University of Missouri.
33 to 7.

All Oklahoma is agog over the
SoonereAggie battle involving anoth-
or Big Six-Missouii Valley clash. The
Cowboys. who clinched the Valley
crown by drubbing Creighton last
week, 33 to 13. will have a stern foe
in Oklahoma, one of the Big Six'S
strongest teams.
