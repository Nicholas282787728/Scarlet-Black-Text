Spring Drills
Please Coach

Cage Subs Show
Promise for
Next Year

with spring basketball drills
under way for two weeks, the
squad is now further along than
in any previous spring practice,
according to John C. Ti-uesdale,
head basketball coach.

Particularly encouraging this
spring is the fine attitude and
the willingness to work shown
by the men, according to Trues—
dale, which, in spite of a squad
which is weaker in spots than
many previous ones, should help
largely in promoting a winning
season next year.

Problem

The main problem for next
year’s team will be filling one
forward position. one guard spot,
and providing an alternate cone
ter. Gone with graduation is Co-
Captain Hal Dean, and his shoes
at guard must be filled. The best
solution for this problem is to
alternate Nash and Turner, both
of whom developed well last sea-
son. Most logical for the spot is
Turner, who won his letter this
year, but Nash has shown iich
improvement in spring drills so
far that he will be just as strong
a contender for the position.

Also under consideration for
the post will be Jerry Fort. a
freshman who showed great abilr
ity this season. In the event ,that
Nash and Turner solve the guard
problem, however, Fort will prob-
ably be used as a forward.

Vacancy

The second pressing problem is
the forward post vacated by Co-
Captain LaMasney and Conwill.
Luther, who alternated with these
two all season, will take care of
one forward, but it will be up to
noneletterwinners to take care of
the other. Chief in the considei-a»
tion will, of course, be Vern Rob-
inson, who is a two»year member
of the varsity squad. However,
Robinson will be hard pressed by
competition from sophomores,
particularly Peisner. Peisner is an
experienced ball player who
knows a lot about the game, but
who needs a little work on his
shot, which he is getting this
spring.

Another big question is that ofl

an alternate for Liiick at center.
The most logical answer is Temps
kins, and he will see plenty of
service. In addition Peisner and
Hamann will be used as alter-
nates when Luick is out of the
games.

In addition, there will be avail—
able a number of freshmen from
this year‘s squad who will be
competing for positions, chiefly
Norton, Adkins and Sayre. All
these men will come into the
consideration when the varsity
squad is picked next year.

This is the last alleged sports

the present management, so we
would like to take this occasion
to pay tribute to our one Constant
Reader, Mr. Abram cnittenden of
Langan hall and Burlington, who
once paid us the tribute of coni-
menting favorably on something

We would also like to aCI(l\0\\I-
edge the valuable assistance of
the athletic department during
the past two years. The help of
coaches John Ti-iiesdale. G. Les-

has been invaluable to us in inter-
preting current athletic problems
for our readers. We wish them
continued and increasing success
in their athletic endeavors.

or special interest this week is
the announcement by Duke, var-e

meet to be run here with Coe on
April 16. As far as we know,
this is the first time that an in-
tercollegiate meet has been run
off on this basis

There are two purposes in put-
ting the competition on a team
basis, according to Duke. The
first is to give more men achance
to run. To this end, all the track
events are relays, so that as
many men as possible can come

limit the scoring power of one exc

Grinnell Nosed Out
64-53 by Mermen
In Valley Meet”

Grinnell swimmers were nosed
out of first place by a close mar-
gin Saturday night as the Wash
ington university Bears captured
their fourteenth Missouri Valley
conference championship in 15
meets with 64 points to the Pie-
neers’ 53. Oklahoma Aggies to-
taled 30, and St. Louis university
trailed with 17.

One conference record was
broken. Clair‘ staley, Washing-
ton, high point man for the ever
ning, won the 100, 220 and 440-
yard freestyle events, lowering
the old 220 mark from 2:23.4 to
2:218. The old record was set
by Fred Varney, also of Washing»
ton, in 1935.

The Pioneers took the lead eai»
ly in the meet when Jack Lam»
berson, Earl Melgard and Harry
Livermore finished one, two, three
in the 50ryartl freestyle, and fol-
lowed up with Boyd Burchard
and Livermore taking first and
second in the fancy diving.

triumphs plus Washington’s greatr

Bears home in front.
