MORE ABOUT MneINTosa

Action of a District Court judge in refusing citizens
ship to Professor Douglas c. MacIntosh of Yale univer-
sity because the applicant would not promise to go to
war unless he thought the war morally justified was
criticized in these columns three weeks ago. It was
pointed out that if America is to become enlightened, it
must maintain freedom of conscience except where it
clearly violates the moral or religious sense of the com»
munity.

Now there comes to our attention/an exerpt from
a magazine published by one of our large American
corporations in which Professor MacIntosh is criticized
and the judge commended. We quot : “Instead of be
ing surprised that he was refused citizenship, Professor
MacIntosh should have been still more surprised had
his application been accepted. For he proposed to be-
come a citizen on his own terms. a - , It ought to be
quite clear by this time that the citizens of this country
set the temis upon which they will welcome an alien
as one of themselves."

Such an attitude is typical of a wide-spread der
fense of the conservative attitude adopted by the courts
in such cases. Nevertheless, it overlooks the real issue
raised by Professor Macintosh. He was not objecting
to the right of the people to set the terms upon which
foreigners should be admitted to citizenship, but voicing
his protest against the terms as they know stand, and
again we say that his courageous stand should be com—
mended for it is in line with the movement toward

T1117) GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

peace. as agarnst'the movement for war.

Decision of the courts in such cases as those of
Professor Macintosh can mean but one thing: that to
applicants for citizenship the right of freedom of con-
scicnce may be denied under the terms as they know
stand. Shall we crit e the psychology of the Amer-
ican people which insists that a citizen shall promise
to bear arms on all occasions, or that of Dr. MacIntosh,
who insists that a citizen may do more for his country
by hearing arms for peace than for war? If civxliza-
tron depends on peace for advance in the future, criti-
cism must be directed against conservative America
rather than liberal professors of theology.

We doubt if Dr. MacIntosh seriously expected to be
admitted to citizenship with the terms as they are at
present. Certainly he did not come “jauntily to our
gates, expecting to lay down his own terms for adeSA
siori," as the business magazine implies. Rathcr, his ap

plication was in the nature of a challenge to intelligent.

America to take a progressive stand on the admission of
citizens to this country, and as such should not be at—
tacked as that of a “jaunty foreigner," but commended
as that of a progressive American.

CONCERNING CARS.

The liberal attitude manifested by the administra-
tion in regard to student use of cars is to he commend-
ed. This attitude was revealed in a letter sent to the
parents of students, stating that while college authori-
ties looked with disfavor upon unrestricted student pos~
session of autos. they did not for-hid cars.

The main objection to automobiles on the campus
would he the injurious effects they might have on
grades. To have forbidden them on this ground would
not, we believe, have solved the grade problem. In
the ﬁnal analysis, the way in which a student took his
recreation, or the amount of time he devotes to such
recreation would be a personal problem. A rule
against cars would simply be eliminating one of an in—
ﬁnite number of possible distractions to the under—
graduate. A student who would spend time that should
be devoted to studies in dodging ditches on a muddy
Iowa road probably would, were cars forbidden, spend
the same amount of time engaging in highrpowered
discussions, water lights, or other favored dormitory ace
tivitics.

In throwing the burden of decision as to whether
he should or should not have a car, upon the student,
the administration it would seem, has placed the re-

sponsibility where it belongs.

Tonight at 7:30.

“With one sixth of the amount
spent upon the army and navy in
this country during a single year, a
working peace establishment could
be maintained," said a member of
the Grinnell women’s debate team in
a debate on armaments with the
University of Iowa in A. R. H. au-
ditorium Monday night. The ques-
tion was, “Resolved, that a policy’ of
disarmament should he adopted."
The Grinnell affirmative team was
composed of Mildred Utley, Helen
Cleland, and Dorothy Nelson. The
Iowa negative debaters were: Marie
Nelson, Elinor Cherny, and Virginia
Cone. Vera Shouts acted as chair»
man.

Disarmament Essential

The women's affinmative team
Monday night, maintained that dis-
armament is essential because the
present system of armaments is
economically, pschologically and
politically unsound. “Each year a
great amount of money is spent on
destructive purposes which should he
used for constructive ones, Competi-
tion in armaments gives a feeling of
unsecurity, suspicion, secret alli-
ances, and eventually war. The
while thing is inconsistent with the

Five Takes Gates

Clark scored its second victory of
the sceuson Saturday by defeating
Gates hall, 6-3. The game was close
throughout, with Five leading by a
run or two most of the way. Kuko-
lich, who pitched for Gates, starred
for the losers, hitting a home run be»
sides doing some good work in the
box. Arent, as usual, was hurling
with plenty of steam, and Hank
Thomas was the backbone of Clark's
offense and defense.

Dibble Beats Two
Dibble scored a rather unexpect-

afternoon by 10—3. Wilhelm was
"right," and Langan found it hard to

in the infield by Brown. While Six
only got four hits themselves, Lan-
gan made many errors, and Dibble
amassed five runs in the first in-
ning, and five more later in the
game, bunchlng their hits, employing
clever hose-running, and making use
of all gifts offered by Two in the
way of errors,

to be the formationofacentralform-

armament is the cost that we pay
for having a disorganized world.
Before we can disarm, the people
must be thoroughly educated to the

are trade disputes, colonization, sus-
picion between nations, and minori—
