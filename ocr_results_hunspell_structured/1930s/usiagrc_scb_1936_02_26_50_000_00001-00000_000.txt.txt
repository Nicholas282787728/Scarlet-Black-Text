Houston, Kirk
Replace Luck, -
Winholtz in Play

Florsbel Houstoir '35, and car»
tcr Kirk '35, will replace Betty
Winholtz '37, and val Luck '39, re-
spectively as Valeria Valencourt
and Jimmy Anthony, iii the play,
”No Women Wanted," now being
rehearsed for production some
time in March, it was announced
this morning by Mrs. Sara Sher-
man Fryor, director of drama.

"Bath Miss Winholtz and Mr.
Luck resigned from the cast be-
cause they felt that they could not
afford to give the extra time to
releaming their parts, which at»
ready have been rewritten several
times by the playwright, Mr, Wi1<
lizm F. Davidson,” Mrs. Pryor
laid this morning.

Mr, Davidson has been visiting
the campus each week-end for the
past month in order to rewrite and
polish his play, which is to have
its premiere presentation here,
and this constant rewriting
has placed a great bur-den up-
on the cast, Mrs, Pryor ere
plained. Both Miss Huston and Mr.
Kirk are experienced players and
do not find releaming the lines
and business as difficult as more
inexperienced players do.

Don’t Worry Folks!
Chapel Floor Sagged
a Bit This Morning

Although it sounded like the
chapel was falling this morning
during Dr, Kagztwct's address
when the floor suddenly shook
and groancd, it really remained
perfectly intact, and the only
harm done was the breaking of
a secondary pile support in the
basement

“Some students thought the
floor dropped three or four inchr
es, but it only settled one-fourth
of an inch, and this easily can
be repaired,” Mr, Paul P. Mays
ers, maintenance superinteir
dent, said this after-noon

“The chapel is perfectly
safe," he declared “The sup-
port, which broke this morning,
is only an auxiliary one, The
building has been constructed to
hold 200 pounds to the square
foot, and there were not more
than 50 pounds to the square
root this morning."

last night It is.expected that a fie
nal check withine a few days,
will show that the total sum is
well over the desired amount.

The big increase iii the total
over the sum reported in the last
issue of thc Scarlet and Black was
mainly due to the receipt of incom-
plete reports of faculty pledges,
which are expected to total ap-
proximately 3200.

other increases were
by several halls and cottages,
while in a few cases, the actual
amounts arc less than the first

iTracksters to Compete

. in Second Contest

.of Season

Twentyrone varsity trackmen
have been entered for the Pio-
lncers' second indoor meet of tlie
lseason, this time against Drake
university at Des Moirres Friday
night, G. Lester Duke, varsity
track coach, announced yesterday.

The same 19 men who were en~
tercd in the Iowa dual meet two
weeks ago have been entered in
this contest, Mr. Duke stated, and
in addition John Hayward, shot
putter and hurdler. and Jim Brad-
ley, weight man, have been added
to the squad.

Slight Chance of Winning

"Although the prospects for
scoring points against Drake are
better than they were against
Iowa," Duke sai , “the chances of
Grinnell's winning the meet are
slim, It is probable that the
Drake sprinters will capture two
places in the 60-yard dash, while
Fhilson and Tulin in the hurdle
races should score points," he ex-
plained,

Philson. Drake's phenomenal
high jumper, is certain to win his
favorite event, and should break
the field house record of 6 feet 11/I
inches, having already done 6 feet
5 inches this season.

Strong in Middle Distance

Grinnell's best chances of earn-
ing points will come in the middle
distance events. Barnes and Hess
in the alto-yard dash should come
through with two places, accord-
ing to Duke There'ls also a possi—
