Bishop Calls
. This Generation
‘Most Preplexed’

“You are the most
generation that the world has
ever known," declared Bishop
Robert Nelson Spencer,
the Episcopalian diocese of west-
ern Missouri, in his address at the
all»college convocation Tuesday
morning.

He elaborated on the statement,
explaining that this generation is
not as bad as the older one claims,
but “you are confused and hardly
know what to do about Lhmgs.”

He continued by declaring, A
generation that is doing things
can't blow its own whistle. The
next generation will do that." He
illustrated his statement by citing
the cases of George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln, who were
never considered really great un-
til after they were dead.

Bishop Spencer called today a
time of twilight, ”It is also a
time of fear and also of cynicism,
The mind now does not see the
whole truth," he declared.

He also decried the cynical talk
that education is worthless and
that it is merely a waste of time,
“Don't believe such talk," he
warned, “education is always
worthwhile."

“During these depression years,
American humanity has been so
beautiful that you can't find a
parallel in history," Bishop Spen-
cer asserted. “You have seen
American humanity so beautiful
that you can understand how God
could die for it," he declared.
nThis preaching mission is to try
and bring to you the consciousness
that the Gospel is for all humane
ity."

Freshman Officers
to Discuss Plans
for Homecoming

Homecoming plans in which the
underclassmen will have a more
active part will be discussed at a
dinner tonight in quadrangle din-
ing room for freshman class offir
cers, student leaders and faculty
members.

In addition to the freshmen ofv
ficers, those who will attend are:
Miss Evelyn Gardner, dean of
women; Shelton L. Beatty, dean
of men: .1. w. Gannaway, presr
dent of the alumni association;
and Allen Rossman, president of
the Student council”

“We are moving towards more
class fellowship,” said Dean Gard-
ner when explaining the purpose
of the dinner. “Many alumni feel
that they are not sufficiently ac-
quainted with their class—mates
for class reunions, and that their
friendships have been limited to
their particular hall or cottage.
The alumni desire better acouai .
tance with the present student
body, and consequently we pro-
pose to introduce the freshman
class president along with the
other class officers to the audi-
ence at Alumni chapel during
Homecoming.”
