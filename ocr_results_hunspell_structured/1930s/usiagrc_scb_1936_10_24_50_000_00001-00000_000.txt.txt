cried Irving Klein, 'cello player
in Kl'yl’s symphony orchestra, as
he tumbled off his bicycle, almost
into the arms of an unsuspecting
Scarlet and Black reporter as she
walked down Broad street. The
orchestra appeared in concert in
Her ck chapel last night.

When she helped him to his
feet, he looked around, she found
herself surrounded by a number
of longehaired, foreign-looking
men, all riding bicycles. Tagging
after them was a line of small
boys, shouting, “Give us back our
bicycles- You’ve had your nick-

of what it was all about, the
nearest man, making himself
