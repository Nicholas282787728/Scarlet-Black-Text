“THE SAME OLD LOYAL SPIRIT?”

' (What G 'nnell needs is to be startled out
of its legarthy! Too many of our students
are insufferably apathetic; we’re smllg,
blase and pseudo»sophisticztted.

Homecoming is next week, and what are
we doing about it“.7 Nothing. Or would
you call a few “decorated” halls and cot-
tages and spalsely attended pep demonstra-
tions something” This yeal 2t defentist ate
titude has again infested the student bodv
making our 50- called Grimlell spirit a pain-
site which thrives on the gIOly of oul gild‘
ilon victolies, and \litheis with its losses

The members of the pep committee need
our support. Their job is a thankless one,
but/it could be it genuinely satisfying one if
we would back them ill their efforts to our
kindle our student body with the spirit of
an older, yet younger and undaulltcd Grin-
nell—the Grillnell which inspired James
Norman Hall to \ rite,

“We will sing to thee ill each victory,
We will love thee in defeat

With the same old loyal spirit

Every fortune of thine we will meet.”

In less than a week grads will be coming
home to Grinnell. What will they find this
year? 712M}.

STUDENTS DO THINK

“Grinnell students would make perfect
cannon fodder," remarked a thoughtful stu-
dent as he described the lethargy and care-
lessness of his fellows.

Not all students are thoughtlessly and
blindly drifting along, not even all Grinnell
students. It is true that We are perplexed
as Bishop Spencer said, but we realize our
problems and are willing to face them.
There is nothing so stimulating to thought
as to be at one of the meetings of student
leaders seriously facing a problem, and
trying to find the right or best solution.
Excellent examples of such problem facing
may be seen on our own campus in certain
meetings of the Student government, the
Young Men’s Christian association cabinet,
and the editorial board of the Scarlet and
Black. Evidently the first convention of
the American Student union was just such a
meeting. Their conclusions or program
should therefore interest us.

The A. S. U dleW up five planks to its
program The filst is the right to educa-
tion and security. It states that society

THE GREENE-LL SCARLET AND BLACK

should provide a high school education for
every person, and prevent no one from at
tending collage because of his economic
status. It demands student relief, employr
inent and security. The second plank is iii
defense of academic freedom. It sets up
the A. S. U. against all restriction and re—
pression of this freedom, for democratic
representation on boards of trustees and
education, for revitalizing the curriculum
with content and so purpose, and for
progressive, socially-minded fiction outside
the curriculum. The third plank is the
student and peace. The A. S. U, opposes
militarism ill education and the war pre-
parations of olir government, and tries to
organize and educate students to resist war
and the steps that lead to war. The Union
sponsors the anti-war strike and refuses to
support any war conducted by the goverlr
ment. The fourth plank deals with school
and minority Races. The A. S. U, stands
against l-zicifil quotas and diffelcntials in
schools, intolerance, and segregation, and
for the guaranteeing of equal and adequate
educational opportunities, and the providing
of security of employment without discrim—
ination. The fifth plank deals with the
student and society. The A. S. U. unites all
progressive forces against those interests
which threaten to destroy us.

These students who drew up the pro‘
gram decided that anyone who agrees with
any one of the five planks would be it wel-
come member of the Union, and thus they
seek as large n membership as possible. At
u coming convention these members may
modify the program. These students did
not stop thinking, but their executive com-
mittee lcgularly sends practical suggestions
for action to the local chapters. Whether
or not we agree with the program of the
American Student union we are naturally
interested in the results of thinking on the
part of students facing the Sallie problems
we face. —R.G.

DON’T MAKE IT A SWAN SONG

A great many students are probably not
aware of the fact that there is a most unus-
uni phonograph and set of records located in
the music building of this campus.

This recording machine, one of a very
few sets given by the Carneige foundation
to representative colleges in the United
States, has become, for some obscure reason,
a sort of white elephant that few people
know about.

The set includes a most complete reper—
tory of the gloat masterpieces of music;—
operfi Selection, oratorios, symphonies, son-
ats and even the ”Rhapsody Ill Blue." The
records are not only catalogued, but the
Scores are there as well.

Probably one of the reasons for its near-
disuse, is due to its condition, which is not
perfect. It is expensive to repair such :i
machine, but if enough interest were shown
ill it, it would doubtlessly be fixed.

If the persons who presented this phono—
graph to the college knew how little it is
used, and of the apparent absence of pub-
licity it has received recently, it would
doubtlessly be taken away.

This, then, is a lament fol the lecolding
set. It depends on the students whether or
not it will develop into a swan song.

Other Opinions

You've heard it a hundred times if not more,
but here it is again in its new fall-model guise: “Boy
Bites Beast!"

It all happened near the state training school of
Red Wing, Minnesota—this dramatization of the
Methuselaic “man-bite-dog" gag.

Rey Billy gave rookie journalism instructors
the latest version when he tried to capture a liberty-
loving weasel. As all good weasels will do in similar
circumstances, this one wrapped its mouth around
Billy's right hand. When the "fur-fang" showed
mule tendencies, refusing to be pried loose, Billy hit
him hard with his strong teeth until the animal
passed out.

Comments
of the Readers

To the Editor:
It has been a great satisfaction
to note the recent agitation in
the scarlet and Black in favor of
a college chorus to supplement
the other musical organizations
already organized on the campus,
There are always a great many
students who have singing ability
and an interest in singing for
whom there is no room in the
restricted membership of the Glee
clubs and the Vesper choir.

It has long been my desire that
these students should be given
an opportunity for competent
leadership in group singing. I
am sure that if Mr. Huffman
were willing to undertake the
leadership of such a group, it
could be made an unqualified suc-
cess.

I therefore hope that, the initia-
tive taken by the Scarlet and
Black in this matter may be fol-
lowed up by the immediate organir
zeticn of a large student chorus,
giving an opportunity to all those
who desire to have a part in
group and community singing. I
feel that this opportunity should
be open. not only to students who
have good voices and musical
training, but also to all those
who have a desire to raise their
voices in unison with their fellow
students, whether they have spec-
ial vocal and musical skill or not.

However, it is clear that no one
should seek membership in such
a group who is not willing to
devote the necessary time and
energy to make it a success. It
is obviously impossible for a
group of this sort to do good
work unless its members feel
their obligation to attend all rc—
hearsais. 1 shall look forward
personally with much pleasure to
hearing the Grinneli chorus do
its bit as soon as Mr, Huffman
)5 ready to produce it in public.

Cordially yours,
JOHN s. NOLLEN,

Educator Thinks
Schools Cause
Intolerance

Bethlehem, Pa, (ACP)7AcCord-
ing to claims made by Dr. Edgar
s. Furniss, dean of the Graduate
School of Yale university, hostility
to higher education, as shown by
attempts to suppress intellectual
freedom, is indirectly the respo
sibility of the university itself.

Dean Furniss holds the univer-
sity responsible for the prevailing
opposition to higher education be-
cause of its failure to instill the
tolerant attitude and the ability
for real thought in its graduates,
many of whom are now leaders of
most of the movements for sup-
pression.

“Heresy-hunting associations are
supported by those who have
passed through our institutions of
higher learning. Demand for the
regulation of the intellectual life
of the university comes chiefly
from its own graduates."

The universities have been too

absorbed with their task of train ,

ing students to discharge ade-
quately the function of education
"of liberating their minds and i -
creasing the scope and pentratlon
of their thinking."

Dean F‘urniss believes that the
vocational function of the univerr
sity should not be taken away
from it. Institutions of higher
learning are obligated to serve
society. A future policy that
Should be adopted by schools is
the teaching of proper appre-
ciation of the spirit of learning.

“Delight in and tolerance for
thought cannot be imported by
exhortation," he maintains. “They
must be acquired in the class-
room as a hy—product of study.”

“It should be the task of every
university from this time forward
to make the study of every sub
ject in its curriculum, even the
most specialized and technical, an
educational c‘xpcrience which en-
lightens and liberates the mind.
Training and education can be
fused togethcr in any department
worthy of a place in an institu-
tion of higher learning."

Even English Instructors
Make Mistakes Sometimes

Toledo, 0., (ACP)—Even in-
structors can make mistakes in
judgment. Apparently this one
underrated the freshmen.

Setting: an English class at the
University of Toledo. Motivator:
Instructor James M. McGrlmmon.
who had just delivered a vigorous
speech on the “evils of plagiar-
ism.” Then he assigned the class
a theme topic.

Upon grading the papers, Mc-
Grimmon found some amazingly
similar work. At the next session
of his section he said-

“There are four or five themes
here which I am certain were
copied. If the students who turn-
ed them in will come to my office
after class to claim them, there
will be no penalty."

When the class hour was over,
McCrimmun returned to his office.
Within an hour, sixteen different
students called to claim their
themes.
