ENFORCE TWO-HOUR EXANHNATIONS

This is the time of the year when students
pour fol-ill countless suggestions for changes ill the
metllods of giving ﬁnal e animations. One of tllc
most commonly llcnrd criticisms is that, ill face of
a college rlllc to the effect that. an exalllindtioll
shall be designed to last two hours, most professors
purposely draw up their questions on tlle basis of
a three-hour examination.

The purpose of the present. extra-hour policy
of the college is to allow Slower students to colli-
plete their work, rather than to provide time to
b c crammed with more questions. When the latter
method is followed, not only those who do swiftcr
work, but the ones udlo proceed more Slowly b
come extremely fatigued at the end of three hour -
when they have two sucll examinations in our day,
the Strain becomes a question of hcalth.

A better grade of work will be done in the
exams and a better spirit maintained between
professor and student if examinations are given
With the intent to follow the spirit of the tworhour
college policy now in effect.

RINGING THE VICTORY BELL

Bolls have been llscd for scores and scores of
years to carry news of signiﬁcant events to Amer-
ican people. Whether it was the tolling of a bell
to announce the death of a prominent citizen, the
jingle of bells at yulctidc, or the wild changing Such
as mllst have been heard when the Declaration of
Independence was signed, bells have beaten their
message, either of sorrow or of: cheer, holue to the
hearts of hearers.

Grinllell people remember that the cllflpcl bcll
here has seen the time when it too carried news to
its llcarcrsifor it was once a custom, not so many
years ago, for enthusiastic Students, or perlt '
freshmen who carried out the desires of upper
classmcll, to ring the chapel bcll wllcn Grinncll
won a basketball game,

The bell not only cal led word of Victory to
the townspeople, but it impressed that victory on
the students much better than a casual perusal of
the account ill the morning paper. It was a signal
of frantic, hilarious joy over the Victory, 2 Signal
that the mime “Grinnoll” was ollcc again carried
upward in some ﬁeld of activ V4

Why not ring the bell? If fleshmcn cannot be
sent to pull the rope, why not the upper classmcn
themselves? The noise would certainly disturb the
rest of but few townspeople, and they ,tllrcady are
accustomed to such collegiate affairs. They would
likely get more pleasure ill congratulating lhc
college on victory than find irritation in the noise,

HONESTY AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM

Before a. Sclncsrcr examination an instructor
at the University of Iowa mode this statement,
“Lct no ollc be anxious lost his neighbor does not
do well.” That sentence was direct to tllc point, yet
diplomatic, and produced the desired effect. The
honor system or Student government has found a
warm rcfugc in the minds of the leaders of prac-
tically every college rind university. But what is
it all about? Why should there be student govern
ment? What is the advantage of the honor system?

To be plain, the usc of the honor System in the
classroom is to cope with “cribbing” during cxztln.
inations. Onc Seriously doubts the necessity or the
function of such a policy in a, college classroom.
Whether Sucll a System has been actually adopted
or not, ill essence it should cx t.

There is nothing to be gained except the im-
mcdidtc value of a higher grade. But grades are
only tangible things and represent the opinion of
the instructor or a valuation on his part of what he
believes you know. Further than that tllcy have
no use, If you are above the average and cribbcd,
then for all practical purposes you are of no more
practical value than the suboveragc student who
was honest with himself. The cheater “ got by,” but

OPEN THE LIBRARY

(From the southern California Dnily Trojan)

For the last several years, the university library
has been conducted under a system whereby students
obtain books without entering the actual sanctity of
the library itself. At ﬁrst glance, the system is a Sim-
ple one. By writing the name of the book, its author,
call number, and the student's name on a slip of paper
which is given to a library attendant, one receives the
book without going to the trouble of searching the
Shelves for it.

But aside from causing the student a minimum of
labor merits of the system are nil. What actually hap-
pens is that the student makes out his slip, waits 15
minutes before the librarian ﬁnds time to give ninn
some attention. and then waits an additional halfrhour
before the attendant discovers that the desired book
has been loaned to another person. 01‘ perhaps the
student receives the book, only to discover. after perus-
ing it, that it is not what he wishes after all.

Library administrators explain this closed library
system with the suggestion that it eliminates book
thievery. The fact that it wastes valuable time of those
students who have a desire to learn, that it forces many
of them to go to the Los Angeles Public library for
their needs, seems not to concern the administrators
much. The University of California and Columbia uni-
versity, having larger enrollments than s. c., conduct
their libraries in the generally prescribed manner,
allowing Students to take down the books they wish
from the shelves. It is probable that in proportion there
is no more book thievery there than at Southern Call-
fornia.

KNOWING WHEN TO STOP
(From the Albin Union-Republican)

The other day the writer walked into a. store to
see the manager, and While waiting for him our atten-
tion was attracted to a prospective customer and the
clerk who happened to be waiting upon this customer.
The clerk was pleasant, cordial, and knew his mer-
chandise thoroughly, After looking over a number of
articles, the customer made a selection and apparently
was perfectly satisﬁed.

Here, we thought, is a salesman who knows how to
sell merchandise. But, alas! Instead of Concluding the
sale the clerk rambled on, took other merchandise from
the shelves, and the outcome was that the customer
became befuddled and walked out of the store without
making a. purchase. The clerk did not know when to
stop.

The day following we listened to a speaker at a
dinner given in a nearby town. The speaker was able;
he knew his subject, and his manner of delivery was
all that could be desired. He reached the logical climax
of his discourse, but instead of stopping there and then,
he continued to talk on and on until his listeners became
bored. The good results, which undoubtedly would have
accrued, were entirely submerged by the foot that he

didn’t know when to stop.
A. few nights later We attended a. basketball game.

One of the players, a guard, used a cute little trick
which bothered his opposing forward. The guard would
jerk the forward: jersey just as the ball was snapped,
and the forward was so busily engaged in worrying
about the jerks on his jersey that he was practically
eliminated as one of the parts of the scoring machine,
Not content with jerking the jersey once in a while,
the guard kept at it until the ofﬁcial caught him, and
from then on it was just too bad. This guard had a
smart trick, but be spoiled it all because he didn't know
when to stop.

In times gone by, we knew a business man of
limited means whose integrity and honesty were un<
questioned. He was what men in business call a good
risk, He was granted credit freely, and used it to good
advantage, not only for himself but for those who backr
ed his ventures. He kept borrowing and borrowing and
expanding his interests until the time came when he
spread too thinly, so to speak. A slight business de-
pression came along which affected his line, and he was
ruined overnight. He didn’t know when to stop.

Each and every clay is ﬁlled with lessons in the art
of knowing when to stop. “Well begun is half done.”
but knowing when to stop is equally as important. Think
of the thousand and one business failures, matrimonial
disasters, and personal blunders which could be avoided
each day in the year—if we only knew when to stop.
