Author Tells
Students Here
How To Write

Laurie Erskine, Adventurer,
Addresses Journalists

ion Literary Art

“The art of writing is partly inhers
cut and partly absorbcd by rcading
and w 'ting tremendously,” explain
ed Laumf oi-k Erskine, educator,
author, journalist, and adventurer, in
an informal address Monday evening
in the Main cottage parlor.

Students of Journalism, members of
Sigma Delta Chi. Theta Sigma Phi,
and other interested were invited to
attend. Mr. Erskine spoke undcr the
auspices of the American Association
of Schools and Departments of Jour-
nalism.

Tells True incidents

General procedure in writing and
recognition of good literary style, ex—
plained by Mr. Erskine. were follow—
ed by incidents from his colorful can
can The author is famous for his
stories depicting the adventures of a
Northwest Mountcd policeman. At
different times he has been an avi-
aLor, actor, and bond salesman.

“Writing is inherent.” he said. "Dita
ferent authors may use the Same
theme but each sees it differently.
The sensitivity of each varies, and
each responds accordingly.

“The other phase of writing is ob—
tained by absorption. Experiences
provide stories. 'Write what you
know,’ is the best maxim.”

Two Repertorial Qualities

Newspaper work, he went on, is al-
so divided. “Two things make a good
reporter. One is the ability to write
and the other the reporting instinct
which includes keen observation and
the ability to make a man ‘open up'
and talk.”

In explaining this quality of ob—
servation, the speaker described in de-
tail a murder which he “covered"
while working for the Detroit News,
and an incident in which the members
of the News editorial staff differed in
their descriptions of a holdrup and
shooting which all witnessed person—
ally.

“The quality of observation may be
acquired, but the ability to write and
the ability to make a man talk are
born in a reporter,” he said.

Bold Open Forum

An open forum after Mr. Erskine‘s
address revealed the fact that the
characters in his stories are compos-
ite portraits of actual persons whom
he has known or heard about.

“I wrote a story once about a mos
ther’s reaction to her boy's participa-
tion in a football game, after an act
ual experience with such a mother. I
received a number of complimentary
letters after that, addressed to ‘Mrs.
Laurie York Erskine,’ and advising
that ‘we mothers muSt_ get to.

Mike Pilbrow,
Relay Quartet
to Head Squad

Brocksmith, Indiana, Feared
in Two-Mile Event;
Chamberlain Out

By MAX ROSS

Backed by the moral support of the
entire Grinncll college student body,
a contingent of Pioneer cinder star‘s,
hcadcd by Myron Pilbrow and the
mile-relay quartet, will leave Friday
morning for the twenty-second an-
nual Drake relay carnival in Des
Moines Friday and Saturday.

Coach Lcs Duke’s star performers
will he vying for honors with the na-
tian's best. and they should be well
up in the running.

Two-mile Outstanding

Grinnell‘s outstanding hope for vic-
tory lies with Mikc Pilbrow, one of
the best distance runners in the coun-
try, in his favorite event, the two-
milc. To win, Pilbrow will have to de-
feat the Indiana superman, Henry
Brocksmith, and a host of others,

To all indications, this two-mile
event should be one of the outstand-
ing races of the day with Brock-
smith a favorite to win, Clark Cham-
berlain, Michigan State runner, who
now holds the Drake relay record,
will not be seen in action, since he
closed his college career in February,
losing his last race to Pilbrow in the
Central Intercollegiate meet at Notre
Dame.

illecoru ui Danger

Among the twusmllers entered at
Drake are some of the most brilliant
ever developed. Wright of Wisconsin
holds a victory over Brocksmith in
the Big Ten most a year ago last
spring, and has run the distance in
9:219. faster‘thsn the Drake record.

Brocksmith, whether or not he wins,
should break the existing record of
9:231 held by Chamberlain. In the
recent Big Ten indoor meet, he ran
the mile in the remarkable time of
4:12. and came back less than an
hour later to do the twosmile in
52:13.4.

Relay Team Strong

There are other great distance run-
ners entered including Cunningham
of Kansas, who won the 1,500-meter
race at the Kansas relays last week;
Chapman of Iowa State; Watson of
Indiana, who is Brocksmith's running
mate and Howrey of Notre Dame.

The Grinnell mil relay team, iu~
cluding Thomas, Pojman, Murphy and
Alexander, steps into fast competi-
tion this Weekend, meeting teams
from Michigan, Missouri, Texas,
Iowa, Indiana and others. The lineal»
ifylng heats will be held Friday, the
first. three teams in each of the two
heats winning places in the finals
Saturday.

Thief Sentenced Saturday
Denies Robbery of Vault

Altho John King, 23, residence un-
known, who was scntcnccd in district
court Saturday afternoon to serve 25
years at Anamosa, coufessccl to hold-
ing up several business houses hero
and being a party to blowing up a
number of safes. he denied any knowls
edge of the burglary of the Grinnell
college vault Jan. 6, at which time
the sum of $400 was taken.

It was at first thought that King
and Fred Stover, 29, who was arrests
ed with him in Pekin, Ill, last week,
were either the men who robbed the
college safe or that they knew who
“pulled the job."
