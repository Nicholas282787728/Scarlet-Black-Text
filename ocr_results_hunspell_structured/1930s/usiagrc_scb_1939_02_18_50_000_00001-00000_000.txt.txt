This Evening

St. Louis U. Foe
Of Crinnell Monday
Prior to Horne-Stay

By Clark A. SmiLh.
Srinnell's cagers are in St, Louis
toiright where they will meet
Washington university in on ef-
fort to rise above thei .500 rat-
ing in the conference standing,
The contest has been billed as
the curtain raiser of a double-
header, the second contest of the
evening being between St. Louis
university and Drake university.
Oppose nilllheirs Monday.

The Pioneers will remain in
the Missouri city until Monday
night after they have played a
contest with the St. Louis uni-
versity Biliikens. In both oppon-
ents, Grinnell found little to of»
fer in the way of opposition when
they defeated them on the home
floor. However, the St. Louis
teams play best_ on their home
floors, so the outcome of the
games cannot he taken too much
for granted.

Against Washington tonight,
Coach John c. Truesdale was a
little worried as to what to ex-
pect from the Bears. "They're
awt'ully fast, and playing on a
big floor, we can‘t use a check-
ing defense or our tactics will
boomerang on us."

Two Additions to Squad.

To meet the speed of the Bears,
Truesdale made two additions to
his traveling squad, David Miller
and Alec Danakas. The latter
joined the squad at the end of
the first semester, a graduate
from Wright Junior college, Chl-
cago, 111. He stands an inch above
SIX feet and besides his height, his
polished floor play has proved to
be a valuable addition to the
squad.

Besides these two men, the
squad making the trip consisted
of the seven regulars and alter-
nates. Capt. Robert Berry, John
Turner, Eugene Peisner, James
Nash, Wilbur Luick. Fred Luth-
er and Jerry Fort.

Home-Stay Follows.

anesdale is not quite so were
mad about Monday'night as he
figures Grinneli will out-last the
poorly conditioned St. Louis team.

Following the present road trip,
the Pioneers will have a home
stand of three games before wind-
ing up their season in Des Moines,
March 3, against Drake.
