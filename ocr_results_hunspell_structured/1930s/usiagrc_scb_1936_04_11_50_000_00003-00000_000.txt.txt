Change Election Date.

The Publication board also ap
proved the recommendation of the
present administration that the
new editor and business manager
be elected at leas'c three weeks be-
fore spring vacation, and that the
newly elected administration take
office immediately after spring va—

cation, instead of in the middle of
April as has been the custom in
the past.

Hunn announced that he would
hold new tryouts shortly after
April 18 and that anyone who is
interested in trying out for the
news staff should get in touch with
him.

To Choose New Assistants

“There will be several vacancies
on the editorial staff, and anyone
who desires to work up to the po-
sition of managing editor next
year should begin immediately to
try out for the position of assistant
editor. No candidates will be con
sidered who do not have experience
as assistant editors." Anyone
wanting to tryout for the position
should see him at once.

“The positions of managing edia
tor and business manager are sal—
aried ones," Hunn explained “And
next yea!” there will be an excel-
lent opportunity for someone to
work up to a salary job."

Definite tryout dates will be an»
nounced later, he said.

The new business manager ine
tends to hold tryouts for positions
on the advertising staff as soon as
possiblc. “1 will need several ase
-sistants and they will have a
chance to work up to the business
iuanagership next year," Brink
said yesterday.
