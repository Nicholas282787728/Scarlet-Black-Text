Sophomores Watch as Freshmen
Decide to ‘Sack’ Lordly Opponents

The time for the freshman sopho-
more scrap is drawing near. The ex-
pectancy which the participants and
spectators are showing indicates that
there will be a good scrap and a good
crowd out on Ward ﬁeld to see the
event.

As this type of scrap is an inno-
vation on the campus, everyone is
curious to see it. All are wondering
whether or not it is rough, whether
or not it is thrilling, or whether it
is just another little game.

A Dramatic Scrap:

Those who are to pa-rti pate in the
ﬁght are looking forward eagerly to
a real ﬁght. The freshmen are lying
in wait to drub the sophomores, and
the sophomores are waiting to begin
their usual task of “taking care of
the freshmen." But in this instance
the fresh are not helpless and sub-
missive persons that they must be on
other occasions, and it is a good
thing, think the sophomores and
preps as well as the other men of
the college.

What a drama the scrap will be!

 

A large crowd intensely waiting the
appearance of the heroes of battle.
The lusty men of bravery are lined
up opposing each other, ready to fall
to and crash through the opposition.

First there is cheering, rather fee-
ble but ever increasing in volume,
Preps! Preps! Preps! The ﬁghters
are squaring their shoulders, leaning
forward. The stage is set. The great
arc lights over Ward ﬁeld snap on,
The whistle is blown. The preps and
sophs rush together, and the epic
ﬁght for glory and favor of ﬁne lad-
ies will have begun.

Bewildercrl Preps!

All but the sophomores are praying
for the tender preps. For who doesn't
sympathize with the young things.
always in an inferior position, be-
de\ ed by those ruffians, the soplwr
mores, and considered by the sophs
as less, for less, than nothing!

Let the scrap begin! Let there be
a huge crowd of cheering spectators!
Let the valiant lighters perromi nee
hle deeds of exceeding bravery! And
may the best man win, whether he
is exalted soph or inferior prep!

This year's Homecoming, which
will be held Oct. 31-Nov. 1, tradi~
tionary as it is, will be an experiment
in that several changes will be intro<
dulled.

The big event is the Creighton—
Grinnell football game Friday even-
ing, which will be the ﬁrst Home-
coming gsme, as well as the first con»
ference game, to be played under the
lights.

Prof. Eleanor Lowden has been
chosen by the alumni association as
chairman of the program committee,
which met last night to discuss
recommendations in regard to the
Saturday program.

Formerly a Saturday morning
chapel service was held, but the
schedule for this year will depend
upon the Friday night meeting. Stu-
dent participation in the event is ex-
pected, and as a result, part of the
day at least may be turned over to
student activities.
