freshman team last year, and dis-
played a great deal or ability against
the Waterloo, 1a., all-city team, both

“Education

Tuesday

“Men may make cities; cities do
not make men. However, small come
munities make great men who are
the result of unitied community life."

This was the thought offered by
H. w. Norris, research professor of
zoology Tuesday morning. He told of
his life in a small Quaker village
whence came Prof, Jesse Macy, “the
greatest scholar and teacher Grinnell
college ever produced."

"The Quakers were not people
whose lives were as drab as their
clothes; on the contrary they em-
phasize the finest side of life and
their children are irrepressihly bil-
ariousithough not in the class
room," declared professor Norris.

Norris declared that the Sunday
ohservances in the village were a
“blaze of merriment" and that the
village itself gave him a liberalizing
influence upon his religious being and
brought him joy in religion.

Jean Reir and Mary Hell, '33, of
Burlington will visit in Grinnell this
