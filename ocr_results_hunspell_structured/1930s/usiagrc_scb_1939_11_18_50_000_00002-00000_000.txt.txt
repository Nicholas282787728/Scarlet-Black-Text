HUMAN INTEREST

Every day in virtually every community ill
this nation the Red Cross is doing some-
thing toward relieving human suffering.

A group of people crowds about the still
body of a swimmer while a Red Cross life
saver applies artificial respiration; a gas
station attendant feverishly ties a tourniquet
to a crash victim’s hemorrhaging arm; a
Red Cross nurse is immunizing a score of
persons threatened by an epidemic.

These are specific cases, taken from real
life, of how the Red Cross operates. It is a
surprise to some of us who had the idea that
the official position of the Red Cross as a
disaster relief agency was its only activity.
Few of us had thought of it as functioning
in our own communities. We knew of its
work in the New England hurricane, the
Ohio Valley flood, the Charleston tornadoes,
and in the remaining 157 disasters of last
year, but not all of us were aware of its
other activities.

We knew the Red Cross was active ill
Spanish relief, but we didn‘t know that the
blind man at the corner news stand was
started ill business by the Red Cross, or
that the sick little girl down the street is
finally receiving adequate nourishment

through Red Cross channels

Thus we realize that on the highways,
on the battlefield, at the scene of disasters,
and in the home, the American Red Cross
takes a definite interest in each human be-
lllg .

And the Red Cross, financed by the

ANOTHER STEP FORWARD

What do I want to do when I am out
of school? For what vocation am I best
fitted? In what subject shall I major? The
effort to find the answer to these questions
is one of the most important factors in our
college education. If we were only sure of
what vocation we would like best and for
what vocation we were fitted we could get
a lot more value out of our college educae
tioll. We could then work with a clear
objective in mind.

Thus Grimlell’s latest pioneering educa-
tional venture, the appointment of Walde-
mar Hagen as head of a new testing and
counseling department, is of real value to
every student.

The.purpose of the department is three-
fold: to examine incoming students, to test
and have consultations with students having
trouble with school life, and to give voca»
tional guidance for any student who desires
help. Tests will be administered to all ill-
coming students in order that those who are
incapable of doing college work will be elim-
inated before they get here. This purpose
is to be accomplished through scholastic apti-
tude tests, attitude tests, personality tests,
vocational interest tests, and physical exam»
inations. These tests will aid the freshman
advisers ill advising the freshmen in their
choice of courses.

The counseling service for maladjusted
students will be useful to students having
difficulties either with schoolwork or in re—
lations with other students. Mr. Hagen,
ill accomplishing the third and most im-
portant service of the new department, that
of vocational guidance, plans to employ
many of the advanced methods used by such
big companies as Bell Telephone, General
Electric and others. The student will be
given a series of tests such as vocational
interest and aptitude tests for medicine,
science, and salesmanship The results will
be interpreted to the student by the coun-
selor. The Scarlet and Black congratulates
the administration on its latest forward
step.

Friday night, the women's Honor

party in Rand gymnasium that is
"an exclusive in the way of

of the organization, ,

“Not only will there be danc-

while there are others who are

Mr. Bench also spoke of the
college man's transition from the
comparatively well—s c h e d u l e d
school life to industry. “The ines~
capable fact remains," he said,
“that industry does not graduate
its top executives every four
years. This comes as a distinct
surprise to the average college
graduate. It is difficult for him
to understand that he is being
employed to develop into an ex
ecntive over a period of time;
that there are no fixed climax

tions, promotion from class to
