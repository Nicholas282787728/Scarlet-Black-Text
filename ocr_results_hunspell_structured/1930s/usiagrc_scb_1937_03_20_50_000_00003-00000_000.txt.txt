A League Stars

The all star Belcaguc intramur-
al basketball team upset the pre-
dictions of pregame dopesters by
nosing out the Arleague Squad Fri-
day afternoon, 13 to 10.

The game was featured by the
rugged play of both teams, the
ball handling of the A team, and
the ability of the )3 team to make
a hotter percentage of their trys
at the basket. Charley Sheppard

star of the after-noon with four
buckets arrd a charity Loss for a
total of nine points. Ed Harvey of
the A. squad led his team in scor-
ing with a total of five points.

Phil Taylor opened the scoring
by intercepting a B tcani pass
and dribbling half the length of
the floor for a onerhanded 'shot.
He was fouled in the attempt and
converted to give the A club the
lead. Sheppard oi the
changed the count hy dropping in
two quick counters from mid-
com-l, Doc White, of the B’s,
dropped one through the net as
the result of some excellent block-
ing- by his team-mates for a 7-3
advantage. The A club came to
life with Harvey sinking two shots
and Schutt swishing the net from
the corner of the floor. Sheppard
retaliated by sinking a fast one
from the middle of the floor to tie
the score are as the whistle ended
the first half.

The second half started slowly
and after six minutes of indefinite
play, white put the B team in the
lead With a heave from the free
throw circle, Sheppard took an
out-of-bounds pass from Hornann
for an under the basket hook shot
to increase the lead to the tune of
13—9.

Harvey ended the scor‘ g for
the A team with a charity toss.
to make the final count, 13-10.

Dates of the Rawson-Cleveland

changed from Monday to Wednes—
day nights by the Council of House
Presidents at their weekly meet-
ing Thursday night. The change
was made in order to avoid a con—
flict with the Honor G date-dinner
on Tuesday.

The house presidents also con-
sidered a proposal to establish a
