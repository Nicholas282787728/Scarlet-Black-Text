Board to Select
Letter Winners

Seventeen Men Considered
for Football Awards

At a meeting of the athletic hoard,
to be held late this afternoon, the
lettermen for the 1933 football season
will be selected according to the min-
utes that they have played. The meme
bers of the committee are EarL D.
Strong, David E. Peck, John W.
Gannaway, and .l. W. Charlton.

It is probable that 17 men will he
given the Honor G sweaters and the
letters, but the selection of two men.
Wesley Clark and Richard Phelps.
will depend on whether or not the
State Teachers game is counted as
half or full time.

The men who will be considered by
the athletic board are Harold Ander-
son, Julius Bauer, Jim Bradley, Wes-
lcy Clark, Victor Fini, Howard Gould,
Don Kingery, Robert McKee, Gordon
Meeter, Robert Morgan, Richard
Phelps, Albert Rose, Abe Rosenbloom,
Earl Safris, Robert Sutton. Bernard
Trumbull, and Luther Hemphill,
manager.

Nine of the above men have not re-
ceived their letters in football before
this year, and seven of them have
not received any Grinnsll letter. Four
of the lettcrmen will be lost to the
team by graduation, so that there
will probably be 12 lettermen back for
the varsity next year, if the faculty
board accepts each of those recom-
mended. Thoso who will'be graduat—
cd are Rose, McKee, Rosenbloom. and
Captain Gould.

Gould led all of the players in the
number of minutes for the season,
playing 529, while Morgan played 437
to rank second. Rose playcd 474 min-
utes.

Revue Expense

Sigma Delta Chi Guarantees

Pioneer Pmdities Cost

Women of the quadrangle will con-
sidel' this week the proposition of the
Grinnell chapter of Sigma Delta Chi
to guarantee the expense of $5 to
each cottage incurred in producing
the Pioneer l=rudlties next spring res
gardless of financial returns from
the production.

Earlier this week, a number of
cottages expressed their disfavor
with recommendations of the dra—
matic council, particularly in rcgcrd
to furnishing the $5 for each cot-
tage’s share in production expenses.

Recommendations for the all-col-
lege revue, which Sigma Delta Chi
has agreed to under-write financial»
ly, will be made in writing by chap—
ter members to the dramatic council
in thc near future.

“Sigma Delta Chi is backing the
Pioneer Prudities for the following
reasons,” declared King Park, presi-
dent, yesterday. “It is an all»collegc
affair which should be the hit of the
year, and a tonic for the studcnt
body. it provides intramural camper
tltion in which both men and women
have a part. Proceeds will help the
chapter to maintain its scholar-ship
for beginning journalism students at
Crinnell, and such an activity will
aid the national rating of the chap-
ter, which in turn will aid the coir
logo of Grinnell.”

First Game Slated Dec. 9;
Coe Authorities Cancel
Tilt Here Feb. 16

Coach John C, Truesdale began his
drive toward development of the
193334 Grinncll college basketball
team this week, issulng a call for 16
varsity men who will comprise the
entire squad.

Fourteen of the men had reported
for practice by Tuesday afternoon,
with prospects that Julius Bauer and
Jim Bradley, sophomores, would be
on hand this afternoon.

Schedule Changed

One change in the previously an-
nounced Pioneer basketball schedule
has developed, according to Coach
Truesdale, because of thc cancelling
of the game Feb. 16 with Coe col-
lege here by Kohawk athletic author—
ities. The Coe slate has been cut
down to 14 games, according to
Truesdale,

a second game with Cos at Cedar
Rapids had also been hoped for by
the Grinnell coach, but this will also
be dropped, and an attempt will be
made to schedule another team here
for the Feb. 16 date, as well as an—
other out-af—town game if home and
home arrangements are made with
some school,

The Pioneer slate at present. then,
consists of 15 games, with prospects
of its being increased to 16 or 17
contests,

Scarches for Cantor

Monday and Tuesday, the Pioneer
cagcrs worked on passing, basket
shooting, and a pivot play from the
center position. Coach Truesdale is
scorching for a center who is tall
enough to control the tiproff, and
who can also handle the ball well.

Prospects—on paperifor the Pio-
neer basketball season look bright,

McCIenon Talks

to Sunday Club
on Hitler Regime

“At the close of the twentieth cen-
tury, people will look back upon the
German revolution as a vital force
in the history of that century, but
whether for good or for- evil we can—
not tell," said Raymond B. McClenon,
professor of mathematics, in his talk
on “The German Revolution" at this
Week”: meeting of the Sunday Eve-
ning club.

Professor McClencn spent consid-
erable time in Germany recently, and
spoke from first hand knowledge; his
speech as a whole, was strongly pro~
German, although he criticized Hit-
ler‘s anti»Semetic policy.

l-litler's platform, according to the
speaker, consists of the restoration
of German prestige, the restoration
of German internal economy, and the
carrying out of his ideal of the su-
premacy of the Nordic stock. uHitler
isn’t the fool people once thought him,
but a real leader, Much of his pro-
gram has been fulfilled, 'although he
is weak in his domestic economic
policy."

Professor McClenon described l-lit-
ler as a brilliant orator, who relies
on the spoken, rather than the writ
ten word, and as a thorough rcnlist,
proud of his humble origin. The
Speaker opposed the view of Hitlcr
as a bloodthirsty monster, saying
that mztny ol the Nazi cxccsscs have
been carried out contrary to the die—
tator’s own wish. He added that any
biography of Hitler irl translation is
misleading, sincc only the original
German gives all the authentic ma-
tcrial,

Manuel Brown, ’34, will give the
first of his series of four talks on
Russia at next Sunday's meeting of
the club.
