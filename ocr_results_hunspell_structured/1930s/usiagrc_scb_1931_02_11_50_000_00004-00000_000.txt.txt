The Scarlet ond Black
Gr—innell, Iowa

Dear sir:

The letter which appeared Satur»
day in regard to church attendance
has occasioned discussion among both
faculty and students. Church going
has now become a stimulating topic
of campus interest. A discussion such
as this will be helpful, if all those
participating look at it with a fair
and open mind, and are in possession
of necessary facts,

Although all legal relationship be-
tween Gi-innell college and the Cans
gregntional denominotiou has been
severed, formal and informal relation-
ship still hold strong. Last year
Grinneli college received from the
foundation for education, supported
by the Congregational church, $30,000
for the endowment fund. =

The state conference of the Iowa
Congregational church has its offices
in Chicago hall. The department of
applied Christianity receives yearly
about $2.500 from the Congregational
churches of Iowa,

Four members of the Grinnell col-
lege faculty are at present deacons
in the Grinnell Congregational church,
and a majority of the faculty are
members of this church. The four
men are Professors H. W. Norris,
E. B. T, Spencer, J. s. Nollen, and
J. W. Charlton.

In the absence of a minister dur-
ing the last six months, President
J. H. T. Main, Dean 1. s. Nollen,
Professors H. s. Canard, H. W.
Norris, n. A. Steiner, N. w. Wehrhan.
and J. D. Stoops have ﬁlled the pol-
pit of the Grinnell church,

Has the “administration of Grim
nell college" taken a stand in the
matter of church attendance ofﬁcial-
ly, or simply by example? Is there
any reason why the majority of the
faculty of a college should he criti-
cized unfavorahly for giving whole
heartedly of themselves to the work
of the church to which they belong?

The Gates Memorial lectures are
held in cooperation with the annual
fellowship conference of the state of
Iowa Congregational conference. The
college provides a nationsfamous

operative spirit cannot be maintained
unless both colege and church know
what the other is doing.

This information could he supplied
in several ways. We suggest setting
a deﬁnite date for the church nfhlin-
tion Sunday in the fall, which shall
he published in the college calendar.
A college relations committee could
he appointed in each church which
could cooperate with college oom-
mittees. Announcements of services
could be posted weekly on a bulletin
board.

The interest stimulated by this
discussion should lead to a better
understanding and a more coopera-
tive spirit between Gl'innell college
and all churches of Grinnell.

speaker for this occasion. the major-
ity of whom have not been congre-
gationalists,

In the past there have been thc
Rover-ends Fosdick and Gilkey. Bap—
tists: Bishop McConnell. Methodist,
and Rufus Jones, a member of the
Society of Friends. Each year the
college invites the Iowa ministers be-
longing to the speaker's denomina-
tion to attend the lectures. 0f the
ministers who have spoken from the
chapel platform during the last year,
there have been more non—Congrega—
tionalists than Congregationalists.

The recent publicity in regard to
the Congregational church has been
brought about by the fact that the
new pastor is a young man and o
Gl'innell graduate. Is it not natural
that all Grinnell students should be
interested in the return of a prom-
inent alumnus? Then. too, the ma-
jority of the Grinnell students, who
have afﬁliated themselves with a
Grinnell church in search for a
“church home," have expressed their
preference for the Congregational
church.

The problem raised by this discus-
sion is not which church should re»
ceive preference among students, but
how the college and all the churches
of crinnell can cooperate more help-
fully to advance intelligent Christian
living.

It is not a question of denomina-
tional competition. but of cooperative
and general friendliness betweenl
church and college. A friendly co-I
