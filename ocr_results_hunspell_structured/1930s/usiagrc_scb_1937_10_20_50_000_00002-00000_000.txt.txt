Moore Returns

Howcvcn Dick Moore has nowl

fully recovered from his bad knee,,
and has had enough practicework
to make him available for Fri-
day's game. Hi addition to the
playing squad will add a good
deal to the Pioneers' reserve
strength,
i No other casualties have been
reported from the Central game,
although there is seine question
about VVaililcc's condition, He
did not attend practice the first
of the week.

In spite of rumors to the con-
trary, iLookabaugh this week will
not split the squad into two
teams as was donc in tlic Central
game. The squad was split then
so that Lookabaugh might see
more of the men in actual play,
and so that more men might get
game experience. However, he
plans this week to keep the
strongest possible team on the
field at all tiincs. It is still too‘
early to determine a starting
lineup for the game, he stated.

bends it to emphasize his idea of

Heartcned by their first win of
the season, over Central last Fri-
day, the Pioneer grid squad this
week turned their attention to
Washburu and the possibiiity of
a conference Wm at Topeka, Kan,
Friday night.

Blocking Drills

Drills this week were slated pri—
inarily to be practice in block-
ing and handling the ball, Coach
Guy Lookabaugh stated Tuesday
that at no time this season has
the running attack been satisfac-
tory, for a number of reasons.
The week‘s drill will be devoted
to polishing this end of the Pier
neers' play.

Washburn has so far suffered
two conference setbacks. They
were defeated by Drake 2570

they still have a fairly powerful -
outfit. It is very likely that the In Conference
eleven they will start this Friday
will have some weight advantage
over Grinnell in both the line and
backfield.

Ichabod Veterans

Rawsoii counted three points in
the third quarter on a goal by
’Richard Socor. The rest of the
quarter was a sec-saw affair with
neither team snowing much pow»
er. ,

Feature game of the week in
men's intramural speedballcompv
tition will come tomorrow after
noon when the two leaders, Lang-
an and Dibbic, meet to break the
tie in present standings
Clark win

In games played so far this
week, Laugsn hall defeated Raw-
son and Clark eked out awin over
Gates,

Ted Appelquist and James Cut-
forth formed a passing combina—
tion for rLangan hall yesterday
and led their team to a 14 to 12
victory over Rawsoll hall. The
victory kept Langan in a tie
with Dibble for first place in the
standings.

Game Ragged

The LaiiganaRawsou game was
ragged in spots with both teams
showing plenty of offensive
power but little in the line of de~
fense. Most of the scoring by both
teams was done in the first quar-

Fourih Quarter

The fourth quarter was played
in semlrtlarkness which held both
teams to a kicking game, After
Langan missed several attempted
goals, the game cneded with Raw
son on the short end of the 14
to 12 score.

Clark and Gates halls battled
through four shortened quarters
in a steady rain Monday, with
Clark winning 3 to 2. The slip»
pery field made it almost impose
sible for either team to work the
ball down the field.

Clark took the offensive in the
first period but was unable to
score. In the second quarter,
Robert Cranny booted a goal for
.Clai‘k’s three points. Gates count-
ed in the third period with a pass
from James Blayney to Thomas

In addition, 22 veterans are
'numbered in the Ichabod squad,
which gives them plenty of ex-
perience. Scouts say that their
kicikng is likely to be better than
Grinnell's, and that their passing
attack is effective. Their running
attack, however, has been stopped
to a considerable extent so far
this year.

The Pioneers will probably be
weakened by the loss of Jack 0s»
born, who is still on crutches as
a result of an ankle injury suf—
fered Friday. Even if he does get

Game Schedule with

“For a team which has had
only about three weeks of prac-
tice, the freshman football squad
is rounding into a fairshape," said
Coach Doyle Reynolds, “They
know their plays, run hard, and
show a lot of fight. By the time
of their first game, two weeks
from Saturday, they will have a
team that will be prepared for
anything their opponents can of.
for."

Two teams are listed on the
fresh schedule. The first will be
against Iowa State Teacher preps
on Nov. 6, at Cedar Falls. The
second game will be against Cor—
nell freshmen on Nov. 20, to be
played here on the morning of the
Homecoming game against st,
Louis university.

As yet, no individual stars have
developed, according to Reynolds,
but, in the line, Kenn'cth Duffy,

guard, show promise. ‘Homer

outstanding backs.

Drake made its position in
Missouri Valley conference staiida
ings even more secure this week
as the Bulldogs set Creighton,
the most disappointing team in
the conference this year, back on
their heels by a 9-0 score.

Drake now has a win total of
three Valley games, and looks
very solid there in first place.
Oklahoma A. dc M. surprised the
critics, who have been extremely
doubtful about the Ags’ power this
year, by whipping washburn 25-3,
thus serving noticc that other
conference teams would do well to
look to their laurels.

In non-conference games this
week, the Valley came out better
than has been the case so far.
Grinnell got its first win of the
year by taking Central 14-0; St.
Louis took South Dakota; Wash
ington upset the dope by beating
Bradley, and Tulsa eked out a tie
with Rice.

Most important battle of this
weekend will occur between the
Aggies and Tulsa, as Oklahoma
will try to prove its title to a
first place ranking.
