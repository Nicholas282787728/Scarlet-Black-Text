Play .at MarquetteThursday ;
Kohawks Slated Here
Friday Night

Prospects of a strenuous workout
this week, with Marquette scheduled
at Milwaukee Thursday night and
Coe here at7:30 pm, Friday, resulted
in comparatively light drills by varse
ity basketball men here early in the
week.

Coach John C, Truesdale sent his
men through their regular drills
against the freshmen, stressing tip-
off plays. He is still trying to pull
his quintet out of the eccentric brand
of play which has been shown in
nearly all games.

Broke Bluejny String

Marquette, with a team which not
only broke the
10-game winning
streak of Creighton

niversity, but
which also holds Vic—
tories over two Big
Ten quintets, is far
vored to take the
contest despite the
loss of Whitey Bud-
runas, center, and
Tuffy Ronzani,
guard, through in-
eligibilities.

While the loss of Budrunas has
sapped the offensive strength of
Coach Bill Chandler's Hilltoppcrs,
they still boast a crack defense and

basketmen to 18 points Monday night.
Paris, Good set Pace

The Pioneers will return from Mil—
waukee at 5:35 pm. Rriday and are

scheduled to take the floor with the
Kohawks that evening. Grinnell al—
ready holds a 23-27 victory over Coe,
winning the contest at Cedar Rapids
with two field goals in the final
minute of play,

Paris and Good have been setting
the pace for the Midwest conference
team this season, the latter leading
the scoring against Grinnell.

Duncan in Form

Coach Truesdalc's chances have
been bolstered by Frank Duncan's re-

turn to form, The lanky forward
started slow this year, but has been
hitting the hoop wth his hookeshots
in recent contests, scoring 32 points
ilfhis last three games.

Frye, sophomore forward, whose
scoring spree maintained Grinnell
honors in early season games, has
dropped from his former high
counts but is still hitting regularly.

Pleasure of London

By H. w. NATLACK

It's a great thing to have a musical
performance once in a while which
demonstrates that the finest in music
may not only be enjoyable, but can
be fun, downright fun. The pleasure
John Goss and his London singers
had in Herrick chapcl Monday ever
iiing was so spontaneous that
quickly became epidemic,

Musicians of unquestioned sound—
ness and education, and splendid
singers in the bargain, this group has
made a study of the part-song. a
special type of composition highly
developed in the sixteenth and seven-
teenth centuries. but almost lost ex-
cept for occasional attempts by glee-
clubs and choral societies. The part»

but by no means crude type of singa
ing.

Once Popular

AS one who has read Pepys may
gather, the ability to sing at sight,
or even to extemporise in compli-
cated vocal counterpoint was at one
time the mark of an educated gentle-

Superb Equipment

The technical equipment of this‘
group is superb, and every item on
the program was exquisitely polls-he]
ed in all its details. Accompaniments
of great intricacy were splendidly}
played by Gavin Gordon, who at the
same time sang with the utmost
nonchalance. In fact, throughout the
entire program, unaccompanied as
well as accompanied, there was a de—,
lightful absence of the selfrconsciousl
strain that often makes ensemble
music hard to enjoy.

The man of nature is not as good as
pictured, however, and selfishness,
prominent fault of all mankind, is
present in him as well, Dr. Niebuhr
said.

”Modern religion knows little of sin
or repentence,” he continued. “The‘
church is optimistic as to the worth
and goodness of man. Science, on
the other hand, is pessimistic toward
human nature, Economic principles
are based on man's selfishness."

Paradoxical Creed . l

Cid. icl-il religion maintained a!
paradoxical creed, exemplified by?
Jesus teaching that every man is a
sinner and a child of God. ”Jesus car.!
ried out his teachings by telling-
bad how good they were, and thel
good how bad they were," Dr. Nle~
buhr remarked.

The speaker believes that all laws
of the country are products of the‘
selHntereSts of the dominant group.
The selfish self is always hidden be-
hind a face of unselfishness, however.

“There is need," he concluded, "for
a combination of social restraint and
self restraint, With social restraint
alone, a conflict always results. Self,
restraint is essential and is still a
problem of society."

Philanthropy

Philanthropy does not solve social
justice, believes Dr. Reinhold Niehuhr,
who delivered the first Gates Memor»
ial lecture Tuesday morning.

"When philanthropy does not ap-
proximate a decent scheme of taxa-
tion in providing for the unemployed
of this country, its very purpose is
lost," asserted the speaker.

He went on to explain that the
United States with nearly 10 million
unemployed persons, had not raised

The Rawson team put up a good

score to 10 to 8. but failed to count

Duke Stages
Time Trials

Thomas, Pilb‘row Set Paces

on Indoor Track

Grinnell college track candidates
underwent their first time trials of
the current indoor season Saturday
afternoon in the men‘s gymnasium.
Coach G. Lester Duke said that the
showing of his mcn was good can-

lsiderlng‘ the early season and the
lpoor running facilities.

cocaptain Hank Thomas and My-
ron Pilbrow proved the stars of the
session, each doing the best time
shown on the local records at this
stage of the season in his event.

Two performances which gave evi»
dcncc of promise were those of Wy~
man Gerhardt and John Lund in the
haifemile. Gerhardt's time was close
to the track record of 2:11 held by
Dick Murphy, who established that
mark two years ago. Several men are
not in shape to go at top speed, al-
though the first meet of the season
will be held Feb. 20 with Iowa State
college at Ames. Joe Pojman, quarter
miler, and Joe Pfeifer, distance run-
ncr, did not take part in the trials
Saturday.

As a result of performances Satur-
day, Coach Duke believes that the
team will be fortified in all races
from the quarter up, After the Iowa
State dual. the Pioneer runners will
clash with Drake at Des Moines
March 4. Coach Duke will take some
of his stronger men to the Central
Intercollegiate meet at Notre Dame,
March 12, while on March 19 they
will compete in a meet at Iowa City,
