HEALTH AND EXAMINATIONS

A true examination is a mind functioning at
its highest efficiency.

Yet many students will make the mistake dur-
ing the coming week of coming to exams with
lllillds dripping with facts, but functioning at low-
est efficiency. They will forget that health, if not
the greatest thing ill the world, is at least more
valuable than grades.

In a winter so adapted to giving colds, it is
more than usually important that students . lonld
not by lowering their vitality make Il’loms Iv S

THE GRINN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

COPY
(From “Jurcllaliu; Unpublished ropcr of on
Unknown Author")

Writing an article or a story is a hazardous occur
potion; there is always involved the risk of getting
drunk.

The paper has not been defilcd with more than two
or three lines of typing before your ideas begin to flow
fast. Down the neryes of your arms into your fingers
the \vul‘dvilllpulses travel; into the leverage of the ma-
chine they leap, and spring into position upon the paper
ipregnant words, caressing or palpitamt, soothing or
stirring. Time after time your hand flies automatically
to the carriage return- time after time the paper leaps
a line or two; finally is covered with your thoughts. It
is perilous to fall victim to the intoxication of making
copy.

You jerk the sheets from the typewriter, make a
few hasty corrections in pencil, and send them back to
the linotypists. Your words pass into their brains in
some inexplicable way, down through their rapid fingers;
the matrices fall into the channel and give form to sing
after slug of hot white metal in the galley. First a line.
then a paragraph, then a column; then a full page of
print; all formed of the seethihgs of your brain. It is
perilous; you would stop for very fear were you not
drunk making copy.

Nor is that all. There are the presses waiting. The
boy carries your words, now immutable in metal, to thel
stone, where the make-up man surrounds them with an
iron frame and wooden blocks and locks them into place.
The staggering pressmen strain the form into its place
on the bed. The frame is locked into place; the press-
man makes a last inspection of his machine; ink, pspe
type, are already. He draws a lever over; the press
crashes into life. Now recover your words! Down the
moving band of paper emerging from the machine your
copy does a devil»dance; your errors, your blunders, your
misjudgments leer at you as they hurry by. Remorse
lessly that band of paper flows into the folder like a
river, ceaselessly the folder cuts and spews out com-
pleted newspapers, a hundred more every time you glance
at the clicking indicator.

Try to recover your words! The results of your
verbal drunk are flung at the waiting newsboys, bundled
into trucks, dumped into railway cars, packed into roar—
ing airplanes. A hundred thousand people in a dozen
cities will read them and eagerly believe themifor are
they not in print? Editors will feed paper to their bat-
tered typewriters and hasten to exalt you to heaven on
a pedestal of words or to bury you under an avalanche
of copy. Again the presses turn and multiply their words
ten thousand and ten thousand times and yet ten thous-
and more.

While you, in front of your typewriter for another
day’s stint, suddenly feel another urge to write. And
down the nerves of your arms into your fingers the
wordrimpulses travel; into the leverage of the machine
they leap, and spring into position upon the paper . . . r

FINANCIALLY STON‘I
(From the Dnily Northwestern)

Former high school students, diplomas in hand, come
to college obsessed with the lofty idea that they are
going ”to work their way through college.” They‘register
for their courses, and they confidentially talk over their
little plan with their advisers, who are always glad to
see the undergraduate stuffed with such ambition.

However, the plan usually peters out before the
four years have ended, and the student finds himself
appealing to the personnel office in search for the funds
to continue his college education. In "ordinary times"
such an appeal to the many-cornered pocket of the loan
department usually meets with approval. But at present,
the student who seeks such aid will probably find him-
self eollegiately stranded, The loan department of the
university is sadly taxed. As yet it has not gone so far
as to warn the financially» ling student that he should
not expect aid from the university.

The University of Illinois, however, has officially
issued an announcement to the effect that Horat
Alger—minded students should not expect monetary aid
from the university in treading the four year college
path. Housewives and business men will probably throw
up their hands in indignation at such an attempt to
make a college education an offshoot of aristocracy.
They will probaby set up the far cry that “Education
without democracy is tyranny.”

Possibly it is tyranny, but it is, for the present, a
fact. The student loan department of this university as
well as in others is exhausted, and students wishing to
go to college must depend on previously earned funds.
Part-time jobs aré a rarity. and university loans are
not to be had. '

Hitch-hiking oue’s way through college, for the
present, must be classed as impractical myth, a hardly
attainable ideal.

A PERIOD OF GROWTH
(From the Detroit Varsity News)

Do you attend college for the purpose of acquiring
knowledge or for the prestige and influence which is at-
Lacllcd to the possessor of a. degree? Do you think in
terms of units and credits while you count off weary
hours spent in class?

College life is not measured by the ticking of a clock

. it is measured by growth of knowledge, by the
gradual expansion of the student's mind. Its value is
not determined by the number of hours spent in cln. s,
the number of units checked off on a schedule . , . it
is determined by the improved qtlaliLy of one's capacity
to live a richer, more influential life.

College is not a series of hops. It is a period of
growth.

‘Don’t Worry’

Wasted Advice
as Exams Near

“Don‘t Wol‘l'yl" Sage advice llelpfulv
Iy administered by sage instructors to,
nervous freshmen who are making
frantic preparations for their first
final examinations. Willing and
grateful as the freshmen may be for

obey them. Worrying is the one
thing they will be best qualified to do
during these tense days before the
semester tests begin.

Despite the counsel of professors
and upperclass students who have
“been through the mill," first year
students invariably conjure a vivid
and terrifying picture of the fate that
awaits them in the examination room.
No amount of description or conso-
lation will drive this “bogey man"
complex from their minds; experience
alone must teach them that although
the examination road is rough and
hazardous, it is not impassable.

If daily classroom work has been
thoughtfully absorbed and duly re—
flected upon, the freshman has a
foundation for his final test. Plenty
of rest the night before the exam
will perform more wonders than any
amount of hurried cramming. Fur-
thermore, teachers are usually not
wolves in sheep's clothing or fiends in
disguise, and the tests are seldom if
ever unreasonable in their demands.
“Don't worry." Again the trite words
of advice are repeated for the benefit
of all freshmen concerned.
