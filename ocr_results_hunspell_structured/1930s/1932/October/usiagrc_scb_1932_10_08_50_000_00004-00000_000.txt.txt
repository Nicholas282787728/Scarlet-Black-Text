Intramural Sport Activities Open ‘
Monday With Speedball Competition

Intramural sports for the 1932
schedule will open officially with the
first speedball game which will We
played Monday afternoon. The seller
dule for these games vims arranged
Wednesday evening by the intramur-
al hoard, composed of a member
from each hall and G. Lester Duke.
director of the board.

Members of Brand

The members of the board include,
John Shepard, Smith; LeKoy Figs
land Langnn; Lyman Arnokl, Raw-
so William Canright, Gates;
Al Roth, Clerk; Claude Saum.
Dibble. The captains of the various
teams are, Ralph Wise, Smith; Frank
MeWethy, Langan; Laurence Kay-
ser, Rawson; Dick Mason, Gates;
Burton Holmes, clerk; William Par»
zybok, Dibble.

Each captain will be responsible
for having his team on the field at
the time for the start of the game
and any team not ready to play with-
in ten minutes after the scheduled
time will be forced to forfeit to the
other team.

Cross Country Competition

other activities for the intramural
sport schedule have not been defin-
itely arranged. The cross country
competition will be held sometime
this month, but the date will not be
set until later. After each activity is
completed the board will schedule the
dates for the ensuing sport, which
include swimming, basketball, _indoor
baseball, water polo, indoor track,
tennis, outdoor baseball, , outdoor
track.

Last year Dibble Hall won the
Pottle trophy which is presented to
the hell that has the highest average
for all competition during the school
year. Langan minke; second last-year,
Clark hall won the speedball compe-
tltion.

According to all preseason calcu-
lations, it looks as though Clark and
Dibble will once more fight it out for
the intramural speedbali champion-
ship this year. Both have a fine or.
my of veterans, and in the final on-
alysis the ability of the freshmen to
fi in will probably be the deciding
factor. ,

Clark hail, defending its champions
ship won last year when it defeated
Dibble 3»0 before a crowd of 1,000
homecomers, will build its team
around two crack forwards, Bennett
and Holmes, and a pair of sterling
backs, Roth and Rowatt.

Dibble has a slight advantage with
stroiey, Parrybok, Wilson. Hempllill,
Niclson ,Saum. zmrl Van Nostrand all
available for service this year. In ad—
dition, Dibble will have several
promising freshmen, hilt it will be
difficult to develop a forward the
e"uzt1 of Burt Holmes, who with clip»
[thin Frye, led Clerk to her champion—
ship last year.

I Tiicse two teams stand out obovc
the other four buildings, but seldom
‘does any one season in intramural
.sport run true to form, so upsets may
;be expected.

l The best of the remaining four
teams will be either Rawson or
Smith. With Allison, Kayser, Wurl,
‘fmd Maxfield forming a veteran for—
ward linc, the Kelly stables aggrega—
tion has its chief problem in shaping
a defensive combination, Last year
:Rawson’s best effort was an 876 vic-
‘Lory over the champions, Clerk hall,
_which was later replayed after a pro-
test.

,‘ Led by Gwynne-Vaughan, Wise, the
lGrounds brothers ,Risser, Shepherd,
1 and Danfortb, Smith ball, will also be
represented by an experienced club.
'Smith pulled an unexpected feat in
heating Dibble, 4—3 in the season's
opener only to have the contest
thrown out on a similar protest last
year. '

Gates hall, champions two years
ago, and incidentally the building to
end Dihble’s astounding record of 37
consecutive victories, will have Mason
and Canright to build around, with
Wiley, Polacbek, Knowlton, and
Hendrlxson other experienced men.
Langan is in rather a dubious posi-
tion with practically no veterans, al-
though they have a promising crop
of freshmen.

Following is the schedule for in—
tramural speedhall:

Oct. lo, Smith vs. Gates; Oct. 11,
