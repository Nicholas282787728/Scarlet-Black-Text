Yakhontoff
Predicts New
World War

Russian Genel‘al Says Japan
‘ Possesses ‘Moving
Amhitlon’

“A new world war or a revolution
is due in the Far East conflict,"
stated General Victor A, Yakhontoff,
internationally recognized Russian
authority on the Far East situation,
in the third of the Grinnell lecture
series given in Herrick chapel last
night. ”Of the kind of revolution no
one is certain," he added.

A major conflict involving the in.
terests of the whole world exists
while a purely Chinese soviet 'system
is governing 90,000,000 people in
western China and many discontent-
cd Japanese citizens, including intel-
lectuals and burdened farmers, are
turning to communism was cited by
the general as cause to believe that
world war or revolution is probable.

Japan nas Ambition

“Japan is possessed with a moving
ambition," said the speaker. “They
need raw materials and will continue
to extend their occupation of Mans
churia despite the edicts of the
League of Nations.

“Manchuria is considered a hot-
-spot for the clashing interests of
Japan, China, and even Russia," quo-
ted Yakhontoff. “But this is nothing
other than a diversion of our own
contention,” he concluded.

“There is no‘reascn for Russian
agression," he said. Russia is equal
in area to about onesixth of the
world, with only 163,000,000 people.
There are enormous deposits of die
verso natural resources that make the
state practically independent. InduSr
trial production can not meet_the
home demands and there is no desire
to obtain markets for exports now.

Chinese Soviet Independent

"The Chinese soviet system, al-
though similar to that in Russia, is
absolutely independent of the Russian
system," declared the speaker.

“The United States has no direct
and urgent interest in the Far East,"
said the General. “Selfish individuals
are demanding protection for their
Manchurian interests which explains
the presence of the United States
fleet in Chinese waters."

He cited the attempts of Harriman
and others to buy Manchurian rail-
roads and said: “At present the inter-

, ests of the individuals are subordinate
to those of the nation. Until these
interests coincide there is absolutely
no justification for the government
of the United States becoming
volved in he Far East conflict

Franco Supports Japan

“France is supporting Japan's
cause " said the speaker, “to obtain
Japan aid in enforcing agreements
in the Versailles treaty."

France has possession in Indoe
China. She is a financial rival of the
United States.

General Yakhontoff pointed out
that Japan's invasion of Manchuria
today is characteristic of her past
aggressive policy. "Japan strikes
While her more powerful competitors
are involved in other affairs."

Today the economic depmsion has
paralyzed other nations. In 1904
Japan attacked Russian Far East in-
terests. In 1515 Japan forced upon
China the famous 21 demands while
the other powerful nations were en-
gaged in the world war.

"Rut." he concluded, "imperialism
seems doomed and Japan is too late."

That he might catch a train at 9
p. m. General Yakhontoff was com<
pellcd to cut short his answers to
questions put to him by students and
faculty members, The discussion
ms closed just 10 minutes before the
arrival of his train.

“1 do not believe that God is omni»
potent but rather that this world is
so constructed that we may cooperate
with him for the alleviation of Suf—
fering," declared Stoddard Lane, min.
ister at the Plymouth Congrega-
tional church, Des Moincs. at the
conclusion of his talk before the
Young Womens Christian association
Thursday evening.

Mr, Lane’s address was entitled
“The problem of Suffering" and was
based on the present national and
international emergency.

Cites Four Courses

Four things were cited by Mr.
Lane as the cause of suffering, four
things which, according to the speak-
er, mnke the world habitable. These
are the regularity of law; the fact
that progress is possible: that the
world was not made perfectly; our
inherent frce will, and the interde-
pendence of man.

“Suffering is an old, old problem,
“he said," and when we see suffering
it raises the question of God’s good»
ness and omnipotence."

“Nicholas Murray Butler, president
of Columbia university, said recent
ly that adversity is a great teacher,
that it is good for us.” Thc speaker

ards, increasing the crime wave and
causing a disintegration of person7
ality because of the crush of present
day life.

“A Limited Gall"

”God r a limited God, there are
things which he cannot do, He is a
struggling God, working out his
plans in, the face of opposition," Mr,
Lane said, “and there is always the
problem of evil opposed to the prob—
lem of good. Our task is to help God."

Among the causes of suffering, the
first was the regularity of law,
"Without it there would be many
embarrassing situations. Suppose the
law of gravitation should stop func—
tioning while you were walking. Yet
at the same time it is this law which
causes things to fall very hard. For
instance, if a man fell out of a win-
dow, that can not be definitely God's
fault. He planned things but he can—
not regulate all actions all of the
time."

“Necessity for obedience"

"If I invented a machine for cut-
ting shoe soles and made it so it
would work every time; and if I
warned employees that it would al-
ways work and then someone put his
hand under it and the hand was cut
off, would that be my fault?" he
asked. “The same is true in our re-
lation to God. There is a necessity
for obedience in a lawabiding uni-
verse. It is only the regularity of
law which makes any building poss~
ible."

“Wth God made the carth, he did
not make it perfect, because if he
had there would be no progress. The
