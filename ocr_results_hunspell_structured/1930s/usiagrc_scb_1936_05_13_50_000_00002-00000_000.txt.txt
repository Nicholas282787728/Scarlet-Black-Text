JUDGING GERMANY

Those people wllo have the courage to look at
facts in an unprejudiced light can see that many of the
bitter denunciations of Nazi policies, domestic or for-
eign, are unjustified Under tlle present circumstances,
it is dangerous to judge Nazi Germany only by what
we read in the newspapers,

Those who most freely condemn the Hitler govern-
ment ignore completely the onerous conditions which
forced it into existence. The advent of such a form
of government was inevitable. Harsh realities bore
this government, and it will exist and prosper, despite
all self—ligllteous criticism, until it has accomplished
its purpose of putting Germany back on her economic
feet and of restoring her position on an equal basis
with other European powers.

No thinking person could expect that Germany
would bow indefinitely in abject submission to the
odious provisions of the Versailles treaty with its re—
sulting economic hardships and to the poisollously vili-
dictive policy of France and her satellites.

No amount of sentimental wallowing over so-called
Jewish persecution alters the fact that during the ill-
flation period of 1921—1922, hundreds of thousands of
Jews from foreign countries flocked into Germany alld
as unnaturalized aliens bought billions of dollars worth
of property from pauperized Germans, literally for a
sollg. Now they cry “persecution” because they have
to pay taxes proportionate to the value of tlleir prop-
erty before inflation. No naturalized German Jew
who had a clear title to property purchased before the
inflation is taxed any higher than any other citizen.
Is this an unfair policy?

The German working man is now guaranteed a
decent living wage, and unemployment has been reduc—
ed materially. Yet ollr vaunted American ingenuity
and our billion dollar relief appropriations have failed
to accomplish the same tasks in our own country.

As to Nazi foreign policy. The United States ill
its relatively isolated position refuses to join the impo»
tent League of Nations and places its trust in $1,300 —
000,000 armament appropriations. Yet we feel justl-
fied in condemning Germany, surrounded by hostile
nations of unparalleled strength, for leaving the Lea-
gue, and for relying on her own resources for security.
We certainly hold no brief for armament races, but
what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

Hitler, a daring, dynamic leader, is the focal point
for the massed energies of the German people who
wish to force themselves and their country from the
unjust and humiliating bondage imposed on them.
Personal criticism of him is foolish for he is the em-
bodimcnt of the principles for which the German peo—
ple are fighting. As a humalr individual he may be
very ordinary, but as the standardvbcarcr of justice
and equality for the German people we cannot afford
to slight him.

We must Judge Nazi Germany, but let us not judge
by the inflamed prejudice of inaccurate and incomplete
news stories. Judge ill the light of accurate knowledge
of the factors which created this government and
which motivate it today.

—F' to B. Schmidt.

Poll Shows Faculty

Members Oppose

Retaining Present Electoral System

Believe Repeal Failed;
Show Liberal Beliefs.
But Not Radical

By Jerome o. Newcomer.
(Editorial Chairman of the
Scarlet and Black)

“By all means: This device as
prevailing was’ invented for the
stage coach era.”

That was the manner in which
one Grinnell college professor an-
swered the question, “Should the
United States abandon the elec-
torsi college system in national
elections and elect the president
by popular vote?" The question
was a part of a recently conduct-
ed faculty poll on the Grinnell
campus.

While a largo majority of pairs
sons favored abandonment of the
present electoral system, meme
bers of the two old parties tend-
cd to be conservative on this
question, sixteen Republicans vot-
ed to abandon the electoral col-
legs but 13 designated that they
wished to retain it,

Endorse Change

Ten Democrats were favorable
to a popular vote in national el-
ections and seven were against
such a change. Non—partisan
voters cndorsed the popular elec-
tion of the president by more
than a 3 to 1 margin. Twenty
said yes and only six said no.
The total tabulations on this'
question, including the smell so~
cialist group favors the election
of the president by popular vote,
50 to 23.

Another earmark of the "stage
coach era.” is the American sys-
tem of political parties, faculty
members agree. The Progressive
and Conservative wings in each
of the two old parties make the
name “Republican" and “DemoA
crat" mean very little to the in-
telligent voter. At one time the
conservative group dominates one
party and the progressive group,
the other; at another time the
situation is exactly reversed. In
order to clarify muddled Ameri-
can politics, 54 faculty members
designated that they would favor
a coalition of Republicans and
Democrats.

12 Oppose Coalition.

Only 12 persons were against
such a proposal. One professor
who designated his disapproval
wrote on the ballot, ”It is my
belief that the Republican party
can well represent the conserva-
tive element: and the Democrats,
the liberal group."

Inconsistencies were not “n,
common on the questions of pro-
hibition and repeal. Several Grim
nellians who participated in the
poll declared that repeal had been
a. success; that we should return
to prohibition: and that We also
should seek another system of
liquor control.

Believe Raped! 2'. Failure.

Fiftysnine faculty and staff
members believe that repeal has
been a. failure. Only so persons
expressed the opinion that it has:
been a success. But on the ones
tion, "Should we return to prohis
bilion?” 67 participants in the
poll said no, and only 22 answer-
ed yes. A large group of voters
believe that we should seek an-
other system of liquor control.
Sixty-two persons declared that
tiiere must be another liquor cane

'l-ial

effective than either our present
system or prohibition.

Although Grinnell college has
gained a reputation throughout
the country as being “a. favorite
spot of radicals who attempt to
make socialists out of every stu-
dent enrolled here" the faculty
poll reveals that whilc Grinnell
is not conservative, neither is it
Wildly radical, The results of the
poll can be interpreted as being
defi itely liberal.

70 Oppose “Rugged Individualism"

Seventy persons are opposed to
capitalism as expressed by Her
bert Hoover's phrase, “rugged in—
(ilvlililalism." Only 21 persons
favored it.

Fifty—four faculty and staff
members believe in a slightly so
cinlized form of capitalism, while
as others oppose it.

Twentwtonr persons interview-
ed designated that they favor a
greatly socialized form of capi-
talism. sixty-nine persons said
no to this proposal.

Favors Both

one supposedly “intelligent"
staff member favored both oapi»
talism and socialism as well as
varying degrees of each.

only 11 Grinnellians
that we should adopt a strictly
socialistic economy. Eighty-two
persons are definitely against the
dominance of socialism in our
economic lite.

seventy—eight persons believe in

government control of public util-,

ities. Only nine are opposed to
governmental interference in
business.

Twenty-three Grinnollians fav-
or government ownership of pub
lic utilities, but 54 oppose such
a plan.
