ing for their separate class ideals,
Di sions,

“The horizontal division in
Europe," the speaker pointed out,
“have been a product of tardy
statesmanship, of the inability to
compromise." Dr, Sachar believes
that this fact is the cause of
Germany's condition today,

After the World War, he said.
the Allies refused to compromise
with Germany, and consequently
Germany was saddled with a 59
billion dollar burden. Explaining
this fact, Dr. Sachai- pointed out
that Germany’s economic struc-
ture was shattered following the
war, and thus she turned to a
“quack," Hitler, because he plon‘h
ised to give the German people
economic security. The same thing
has happened to Russia, he said.
Frniico in Danger.

France is in danger of going
Fascist, Dr. Sachar asserted, bee
cause there are now two parties
in Franceilhe popular front
and the Fascist element.

“If France goes Fascist, and it
looks very much as if she will,”
the speaker said, "a civil war Will
he the result with the struggle
between men who have class
idolatiies." ,

Dr. sachai- believes that scar
nomio cleavage in Europe is de-
stroying democracy, and because
of this, he warned America to
hold on to her precious policy
of freedom, to ignore the class
element which is already begins
mug in America,

”steer safcly hetween the
carybdis of Fascism and the scylla
of Communism," was his advice.

No Racial Problems

in Russia, Says Ernest

“Russia challenges the world in
the field of progress," stated Gif-
ford Ernest, journalist and eco-
nomic commentator, when speakv
ing on “Soviet Russia.—-A Chal-
lenge,” Friday afternoon in Here
rick chapel.

Ernesthwho has recently re-
turned from a tour of Russia
where he made an extensive study
of general conditions, went on to
point out that after 20 years of
skepticism on the part of the
world, Soviet Russia still stands.

He asserted that economic un~
rest is felt in the masses first.
and that Russia realizes that fact
and approaches the subject in
consideration of the common peo-
ple “from the ground up.”

Ernest concluded by pointing
out that there are no racial prob
lems in Soviet Russia, “and for
the first time in the history of

ences.”

”Mainiain DemocraCy” l

Abram Sachar Pleas

In a plea for the maintenance
of democracy, Dr. Abram Loon
Sachar, professor of history at
the University of Illinois, spoke
on “The Four Roads to Security"
Fiday night at the third session
of the International Relations con-
ference,

As the tour roads to secui' y,
the speaker described communism,
Fascism, Nazism and Democracy.

In Communism, he said, the
mass of people is the god, the
technique is force and the ulti-
mate goal is economic security
for all. In Facism and Nazism
the technique is force, the goal
is power, but the difference lies
in the fact that the god of the
former is the state and of th
latter, the blood community to
the exclusion of all foreigners.

But in Democracy, he said, the
god is the individual, the tech-
nique is law and the goal is
liberty.

“Individual uniqueness is nhat
we measure civilization by," Dr.
Sachar declaicd “The constitu.
tion and law respect that iiidi
iialism."

Those who say, he continued,
that we in the United States are
threatened by any of the “isms”
should remember that if we were
they would surely not be allowed
to say so. No totalitarian state
allows cr icisin, Dl', Sachar added

Germany Has Upper
Hand on Italy, Hodges

That Mussolini has passed the
zenith of his power and Germany
now has the upper hand in the
Italian—German relationship, was
the belief set forth by Dr.
Hodges of the University of Clnr
ciiinati as he spoke at the fourth
session of the crinneli student
Conference on International Rela—
tions this morning.

“If anything serious liap ens in

Europe, the RomevBerliu axis will
be blown to bits in a minute,”
said Dr. Hodges. “No one with
even an eighthrgrade education is
fooled by the surface friendship
which Mussolini and Hitler now

, express for each other.”

situation Not Simple

The situation is not so simple
as it appears to some commenta-
tors or as it was before the
World war, he said. It is now
complicated by the minor quar-
rels of the innumerahle “have
nots," he continued.

Among these are the Baltic
block composed of Esthonia, Lat-
via, Lithuania and Finland,
whom think only of ancient glory
and will probably ally ivitli Gen
many at any time in an attempt
to crush Poland, Dr. Hodgles
pointcd out He added that Ruse
sia would also be with Germany
in this sort of project, and that
German-Russian friendship would
likely be resumed whenever Hit~
ler is deposed because such an
agreement is economically neces-
sary.

pay Italy for previous encroach-

The Rome-Berlin axis is noth-
ing iicw, commented the speaker,
for Germany and italy have for
several years been coming to
agreement, then having to break
away.

"Though the machinery

sider to be just so much tallt, thel
psychological results of the South-
American conference of December

morning.

There has been a strengtheir
