MORE THAN IOSS

Rand gymnasium is no more. Gone is this
tradition in brick and stone, an historic sen—
tinel of the old Grinnell.

And in the blackened ruins thcrc lies
both a loss and a challenge. There is the
material lossithe structure itself, the phy-
sical education equipment, the decorations
and scenery, the musical instruments, and
the personal property. And to those who
have suffered these losses we extend our
sympathy, for to them this may understand‘
ably be the real significance of the fire.

Then there is the traditional loss—the
passing of a monument to another genera-
tion. To the men and women who have
known and used Rand gymnasium this loss
lnay well be the true importance of the de-
struction of this landmark.

But the smoldering wreckage presents
more than more loss. It presents a challenge,
a challenge to Grinncll college, its students,
its faculty its alumni, and its administra-
tion. It is true that the old Grinnell, like
the building which portrayed it, has disap-
peared. But it is our hope that the spirit
which built Rand gymnasium has not disap<
peared, for it is to that spi -'t that the fire
of Friday morning present 5 challenge.

The destruction of Rand gymnasium: a
loss, yes; but more than that a call to new
and greater achievclncntsiat challenge to
the true spirit of Grinncll.

QUIT SQUAWKING

Reprinted from the Texas Christian
“Skiff”

(sailor's Nhlu: The s nrlct to Black reprints this
editorial for the bone 1 of its own soul.)

Why don’t you be different? There’s a big
chancc for some student on the ’l‘. C. U.
campus to immortalize himself by not kick—
ing about anything. Especially would he be
a standout if he didn‘t kick about the things
about which he knew absolutely nothing.

Take the Student Council (Wise guy,
huh? Whattya mean? “Who wants it?")
Ever since Howard Grubbs hit this place,
it’s been the fashion to squawk about some—
thing. The difference between you and
Grubbs is, at least he kicks about something
he knows something about. But you! You
want to moan about something, so you pick
the Student Council, And, Bud, I’ll tell you,
you don‘t know enough about the Council to
vote for the members.

Dld you know you are more than wel-
come to attend any of the Council meetings
and sec what’s going on? Or would you
rather continue to display your ignorance

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

by asking, “What's the Council done? What’d
we elect Council members for, anyway?
What happens to all the money they get
their hands on? Why should we do what
the Council wants us to (lo—we elected them
didn’t we?”

Brother, you’re an object of pity. You
yell at the lap ‘of your tobaccoelurlcu luuys
for “xfudc t yobs hmeut", and yet you Llou’t
lowly the f t principle about it. Say you
did elect your Council members. What have
you done about it since thou? How you told
lhcm how you feel about cel‘tlu'u mullet-s
that come. up, so they could do what you
wanted them to do about them? 07' course
not. Then why should you latch, in your
loudnmouthcd I'yllm'aucc, (LL the way they run
[/ll'llys on their initiative?

The best way to straighten things out is
Io go to a meeting and see for yourself what
goes on. it isn’t impossible to imagine that
the Council will, in the near future, stage a
public meeting. They want you to know
what they do. After all, they’re running
your business. They‘re your Counc .

But what’s the use? You probably
wouldn’t go if they held a public meeting
in, say, the Auditorium. No, you’d rather
sit at home and bleed about the state of
things in YOUR COUNCIL.

A WORD TO THE UNWISE

Mid-semester examinations bring home
to us all the fact that two months of the
school year have hurried by. The first see
mestcr is now half over,

11; is too late to change your grade for
this first quarter of the school year in any
way except one. And here is that way:

The only grades that are part of your
permanent record at Grinnell are the grades
that you receive at the end of each semester.
The grades that you will receive in a week
or two, on the other hand, are not recorded
permanently. Therefore, if you are not sat-
isfied with your work so far, don’t cry over
spilled milk. You can still bring your so»
mester grade up a notch by improvmg your
work from now until the semester ends in
the last part of January.

Grades, of course, can be ovenemphasiz—
ed. They are your professor‘s estimate of
the work you have done. His estimate is
based upon several indicators, none of which
is infallible. It is possible that his estimate
is too low. It is also possible that you have
fooled him, and that his estimate of your
work is a good deal too high. Professors,
after all, are human too. So don’t go grade-
crazy. Recognize your marks for what they
are, and be guided accordingly.

If you had trouble with your mid-semes-
tcr exams, take warning. For compared to
the finals, mid-sems are always easy. And
the best way to review for an examination
is to have something to review; it is impos
sible to cram enough facts into your head
ill one night to pass a final. Wise students
don’t need advice. But, then, there are no
wise students.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
{By Associated Collegiate Press)

“Our first duty in this time of turmoil and
danger is to carry on our normal educational
program as effectively as possible and with
a minimum of confusion. Whatever course
future events may take, the world will need
young men versed in science and skilled in
the arts of its application to promote human
welfarel” Dr. Karl T. Compton, president
of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
1 cs education to follow such policies as
v ill contribute to the maintenance of ideals
which are basic to American life.

“thn you listen to a lecture or study your
textbook, think and apply the materials to
your own personal and environmental prob-
lems. Spend fifteen minutes a day in medi-
tation digesting the knowledge you have
tasted. Let that knowledge be your servant
rather than your master.” Villanova Col-
lege’s Dr. W. H McHugh believes that
purely factual information is useless unless
it is understood and used.

Commercialism
In Thanksgiving
Seen as Mistake

—By William C. Harris.

Thirty days hath September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one
until we hear from \Vashr
ingtou.
Such are the sentiments of an
Oklahoma official in regard to
the current Turkey Dilemma arid
our nomination for honors as the
most timely literary tid-bit of the
yearacxcluding all Tanager con-
trlbutions, of course. For the cat-
astrophic results of Franklin Del-
ands harmless little proclamar
Lion of the summer are even now
breaking about our ears. With
governors to the left of him, goVV
ernors to the right of him, and a
president m front of him, all pm
claiming different Thanksgiving
dates, a slightly befuddled John-
nic Q. knows not when to guzzlc
his cranberries.

Twenty-three state executives
clﬂmhered into the Roosevelt
turkey farm and set the 23rd
as Thanks day, while twenty-
two held out for the traditiolr
ELI last Thursday of November.
Mame, Colorado, and Texas
straddled the fence by pro-
claiming hock dates for the
least. But McGTegor, Texans,
tak s the cake by declaring the
on inl spread [or Friday, No-
\'cmbcr 24. when the local high
school griddcrs mcct n neigh-
boring eleven.

Thus is the confusion which has
been brought about because the
Squire of Hyde Park figured an
earlier Thanksgiving date would
be an aid to the Christmas
trade.

Although this sudden affection
for business may be a welcome
Wrinkle in the Roosevelt philoso-
phy, the thought occurs to us
that there might have been better
ways of demonstrating this 11er
born love.

In blunler language: why
umg more commercialism into
the observance of an already
over-commercialized holiday, in.
holiday which, in reality, was
conceived as a. timefol' ulnnks-
giving. Sentimental tradition?
Perhaps, but America. could
stand a, little more tradition.
Already we've reached that
golden state of civilization where
Christmas revolves around tinsel
and Santa Claus and the Fourth
of July around fire-crackers and
drinking parties. Must we now
hitch our day of national thanks-
giving to the cash register? A
little more thanks ands. little less
Christmas business might not be
a bad idcaiespccially for Amer-
ica.

rel-lvnps we represent the
Last of the Mohicnns on this
question, but it's n thought at
any rate. Pick your own date.
but let us pass on a word of
mm from n Kokomo mer—
uhunt. “Do your shopping today.
\Vho knows, tomorrow may be
Christmas."
