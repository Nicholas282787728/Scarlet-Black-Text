SENIOR FINALS

> In the face of a college rule which stands for senior
final examinations, six representative senior women‘, in
a campus opinion printed recently, showed that with-
out exception they were opposed to such exams, Just
a year ago at this time, also, the Scarlet and Black
advocated the discontinuance of senior finals. This
paper is still of the same opinion as was manifested at
that time, and as is manifest this year. Senior finals
are unnecessary, and undesirable, from the student‘s
viewpoint, which is the viewpoint to be be given in this

‘column today.

We recognize that the growing movement is toward,
rather than away from senior finals. It is argued- that
by the time a person gets to the end of his senior year,
a comprehensive final examination may be a real indica-
tion of how be has developed his powers of concentra-
tion, of selection and, organization, and of analysis dur-
ing his four years in college.

Yet are such examinations really necessary to indi»
catc the mental ability of a student who has already
established himself in four years' time in a more or less
“”.C “B”, or “A” category? Surely by the time a
senior approaches graduation, the mere taking of four
or five examinations is not going to raise or lower his
standing materially with a professor who knows in his
own mind from experience with a student whether that
student is an exceptional scholar, an average scholar, or
a "dub.” As one girl expressed it in the campus opi
ion of three Weeks ago: “For students who have sati
factorily completed the college work which has brought
them to the final stage of their senior year, final exams
are anomalous." That is what each of the other women
questioned replied in substance; that would be the re—
ply of 95% of the senior class. That is our reply to
the question of the necessity of senior finals.

Eurtbermorc. how can professors humanly expect
seniors in the rush of pre»cnmmencement activities to
devote full time and attention to examinations? Frank-
ly, we believe that the strain of final exams detracts
greatly from the enjoyment which the average senior
gets out of commencement activities. or course, if
those activities are not for his benefit, it makes no dif-
ference. but it is usually granted that they are, “But,"
reply many professors, “by the end of their senior
years, the graduating students should have learned so‘
to assimilate their work from day to day that final
exams would prove no Strain.” Granted, on one reser-
vation, which is that outside activities taking a large‘
amount of everyone’s time, be abolished. Then the sen-
ior would have time to absorb in a scholarly way his

daily work and conceivably might look toward final
exams with pleasure. But what power could abolish
outside activities, and who believes that a program of
“all worlr and no play" would attract students to Grin-
nell? The present situation finds the average senior
facing final exams as a strain to be looked forward to
with no pleasure. AS long as the situation cannot be
changed. we can see no justice whatsoever in final
examinations.

As opposed to the view that comprehensive senior
finals are desirable as an indication of‘the mental de-
velopment of the senior during his four ‘yeilrs, then, we
have presented the view that such exams are not only
unnecessary, save for students on the very edge of
flunlring, but, moreover, detract from the period of the
Senior's life when he should be absolutely free to enjoy
college. The regulation concerning senior ﬁnal
exams has already been madeﬁit is on the college books
as a rule—but 95% of the senior class believe that the
rule should be changed, and the Scarlet and Black joins
with'them in their stand.

Elmo ‘ION AND SUCCESS.

The editorial below is not writtcu by a regular
member of the editorial board of the Scarlet and
- Black, but submitted by u member of the news
staff, it seemed intcresting enough to publish in
these oohuiuis and is commended to our readers as

worth their attention,

To what degree does success after graduation de~
pend on success before graduation? Many are prone to
discuss this subject without definite grounds on which
to base their opinionsr It is Lhel‘efnre, interesting to

note that significant data has recently been compiled of

by the Bell Telephone System as a result of a queSv
tionairc submitted to 3,806 college men working in the
system.

The results indicate that those excelling scholastic-
ally in college have the greatest earning capacity after
colleg. Those graduating in the first tenth of their
class‘ on the basis of marks, ten years after graduation
have a median salary of 10 percent more than the
median salary of the\entite group. Twenty years after
graduation their salary is 30 percent more; thirty years
after, 55 percent more.

The data regarding success in extra-curricular ac-
tivities is not so conclusive. Whereas the first tenth
scholastically earned 40 percent more twenty five years
after graduation, those achieving success in campus ac-
tivities earned only 20 percent more. The data also
showed that extra-curricular activities dealing with
Iiterary,editorial and managerial positions were more
beneficial to the graduate than success in social, ath-
letic. musical and dramatic endeavors.

Perhaps we might point out a moral from these sta-
tistics—a moral all the more applicable since school is
just'beginning again. It is thisitbat those who apply
themselves most diligently to the educational oppor-
tunities. college offers are the most likely to succeed
after graduation. It is not best therefore. to strive for
success along these lines primarily and to add as con-
siderations of secondary importance the more showy
extracurricular activities?
