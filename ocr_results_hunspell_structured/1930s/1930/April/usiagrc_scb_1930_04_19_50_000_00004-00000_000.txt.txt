Track Hopes
for Freshmen
Get Brighter

After Two Weeks’ Practice
Point Winners Loom up
in 1933 Squad.

Pojman Outstanding

>Myron Pilbrow Helps in Mile Run ;
Graﬂund Heaves Javelin;
Bowby Good.

By THEODORE GLEYSTEEN.

The Freshman track squad has
developed from an unbalanced into
a well-rounded outﬁt during the- past
two weeks. Almost every division
has at least one man who is a sure
point winner. Freshman football
was only average, the basketball
season hardly a success, but_ the
“prep” track team points to a'suc-
cessful year. The Drake Eullpups
will provide the first opposition for
the little Pioneers when they clash
in Gl'innell, May 9,

The most brilliant performer of
the squad is the diminutive .loe Poj-
man, sprinter. He is also captain
of the outnt. Pojman won for him-
self second place in the hundred
yard dash at the National Inter-
Scholastic track meet in Chicago
four years ago. He and Harold
Alexander, former Grinnell high
schopl runner, will carry most of the
work of the' dashes. Alexander is
also a broad-jumper of considerable
repute, placing second in the home
meet.

Weak in QuartervMile.

Phillip Newsome, half-miler, is
another outstanding member of the
team. He is showing great early
season form and should develop into
a brilliant halfrmiler. While at-
tending St. John’s Military academy,
Newsome ran the BSD-yard run in the
unusual time of 2:01.41. Gene
Grounds, while rather new at the
game of hurdles, may develop into a
classy hurdler. He shows good form
particularly in his specialty—the
high hurdles. The only weak place
is the quarter-mile. At present
there are no men making a bid for
this race, but George Robinson. ale
though he has not as yet reported to
the squad, should be able to ﬁll in
this gap.

Risser in Two Mile

The class of 1933 is fortunate in
having Myron Pilbrow in the mile
run. Pilbrow gained recognition
during the cmssmountry season last
fall when he forced the star varsity
men to extend themselves to the
ﬁnish. He is also one of the few men
in Crinnell who can push Howard
Mcl'lrath in the mile, Philip Kisser
is the only man of ability out for the
two-mile jaunt and gives promise of
becoming a good distance man.

Turning to the field events we find
Fritz Craflund, who is capable of
heaving the javelin around 175 feet,
as the most colorful of the weight
performers. Virgil Bowlby. one of
the stellar men on Muscatine high's
track team last year, is another
strong neld man, featuring in both
the jsvelin and the discus. Charles
Barrows heaves the shot and dis-
cus in line style, and Jack DeWindt,
with practice, may turn into a good
discus thrower. "Snap" James, all.
around athlete, will take part in the
broadrjump and the mile relay.

Co-Eds Go to Dance
at State College, Pa.

a new dormitory completed in De-
cember. We compared it naturally
with the Crinnell quadrangle and
througbt ours better.

An informal reception was given
the ﬁrst evening. Thursday mornr
ing the delegates were welcomed by
the president of Penn State, the dean
of women and the president of the
men's student government. After
luncheon Dr. Carroll Champlain, a
professor in the educational depart-
ment, gave an address on “Campus
Relations." Following his talk Miss
Charlotte Rae, dean of women. en-
tertained at a tea in honor of the de-
legates. A “Campus Revue” was
staged in the evening at the Audie
torium.

Attend Formal Dance

An important address of the con-
vention was given Friday morning
by Miss Mary w. McConougby on
“Understanding Ourselves,” Dr.
McConoughy is director of personnel
at Mt. Holyoke college, and in her
address she presented a challenge to
college women. Discussion groups
pertaining to individual college prob-
lems were held in the afternoon.
Friday evening the Women's Athletic
association hoard entertained at din-
ner at the university club. After-
ward we attended a formal dance at
the S. A, E. fraternity house, We
were told that our “dates," who had
been selected previously, included
the representative men—and we
were convinced that they were!

To us the best entertainment of
all was a breakfast at the summit of
Mount Nittany, which we reached
after a drive of ten miles through
the mountains Saturday morning.
Next to the inn was an observation
tower from which we could see
across the mountain ranges and look
over a large part of Pennsylvania.

Next Meeting at Michigan

We returned to the college to at
tend the concluding sessions of the
convention. Miss Thyrsa W, Amos,
dean of women at the University of
Pittsburgh, gave an address on “Parr
SonhlltyiA Real Objective in COI—
Iege Education." Her vivid applica-
tions made the talk worthwhile, It
was announced that the next con»
vention would be held at the Univer-
sity of Michigan at Ann Arbor.

We feel that we have had an Ops
portunity to hear‘the various prob-
lems of college campuses, and it is a
satisfaction to know that Grinnell
college has the truest from of stu-
dent government. We realize that
our governing board is less restrict-
ed in its power than that of any cola

pieces from the melodic Saint-Sachs,
are both instrumental.

Only one American atmosphere
song in addition to “On the Sunset
Trail" is included in the program
this time. The “Chain Gang Song,"
by Howe, represents the rising Am-
erican folk song genre.

The alumni song. which has tradi-
tionally climaxerl the glee club pres
grams, will end part one Wednesday,
and will precede the composite por-
trait of the old West which con—
cludes the evening.

"On the sunset Trail,” by R, Y.
Kerr and Elias Blum, was the popu-
lar number in the concert at State
Center Wednesday; Mr. Kerr is al-
ready well known to Grinnell audi-
ences as the author of the homecom-
ing pageant and the words of one of
the college songs. A program of
Professor Blum's compositions made
up a vespers program last year.

Elias Blum, Gene Grounds. Harold
Holst, and Justin Leonard will be
the soloist interpreters of this Am-
erican epic. The glee club and a
seventeenrpiece orchestra will ac-
company them,

AN IDEA.

WHY not make your clothes

look like new? Spring is
here and with it the need of
freshness and newness in
everything. So you, too,
should keep up with the sca-
son as well as with the
styles, by having your old
clothes cleaned and your new
ones kept clean by the
GRINNELL CLEAN ER S,
who do your work as you like
to have it done.
