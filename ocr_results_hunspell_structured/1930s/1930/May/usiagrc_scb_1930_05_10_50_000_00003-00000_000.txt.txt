Yale Given Money .
for Study of Press

NEW HAVEN, CONN. a Pres,
James Angell has announced that
Paul Block, of New York City, own-
er of several American newspapers.
has given Yale university one bun»
dred thousand for a program of
studies in the field of journalism.

“The purpose of the studies will
be to promote an understanding of
the press as a powerful factor in
human affairs and as a major busir
ness enterprise," President Angeli
said. "An important part of the
plan is the establishment of a series
of lectures by men prominent in the
newspaper world who, in addition to
their public addresses, will be avail-
able for conference with students
and for collaboration in courses
bearing on the subject of the press.

“In the undergraduate schools, the
problems of the press will be em-
phasized by enlarging the scope of
certain courses in economics and

political science to take account of
this important field of study, In
the graduate school advanced study
and research will be prompted
among students specializing in the
social sciences.

“The plan does not contemplate
the development of courses of a
vocational nature, but it is expected
to bring the students, both gradu-
ate and undergraduate, to a clearer
under-standing of the role of the press
in the complex social and political
life of the modern World.”
