SCHOLARSHIP OF THE 1930 SENIORS
The present senior class has the highest average

scholarship of any class for the last ﬁve years. To peo-
ple who think that college is merely a place where
young people go to enjoy themselves, spending little
time on their work and paying much attention to out-
side activities, dates. and weekend excursions, this
might come as a jolt, because it indicates that besides
the class of 1930 having an unusual number of smart
people, more effqrt is heing put on class work and more

concentration by the class as a Whole on studies.

The signiﬁcant thing about this class is not that.
one person had record-setting grades, but that the
grades of all the seniors, taken as it whole, were higher
than they had been for ﬁve preceding years.

Another notable fact about this class is that 8.
higher percentage of the people who entered as fresh-
men together, are graduating in the same class this
spring, than any other group in the history of Grinncll.
Fewer people transferred or dropped out for various
reasons than at any. time previously, although the
causes for such a record are rather obscure.

The present junior class cannot boast of the high-
est scholastic average, or the highest pcrcsntage of
straight foureyear students, but one of its bids for fame
is that it Will be the ﬁrst class since 1924 to have more
men than women in Phi Beta Kappa. Although no one
from this grciup has been electcd soifar to that organs
ization, yet the averages of students grades at present
show that there are a good many more boys in the highs
est seventh of tne'class than girls, and consequently
more Will be taken in next year.

A STEP T0 UTOPIAi

institutional change is brought about slowly, es
pecially that of a distinctly new trend, because habit is
a potent factor in life and it is difficult for the major-
ity to see theoretical or future beneﬁts when present
conditions, though perhaps not perfect, are satisfactory.
Especially is this,true when tradition has a ﬁrm bold.

For those who see, or think they see, many henc-
fits to be derived by a change from present conditions,
it is hard and often discouraging work. On them ‘is
the burden of the proof; merely pointing out the prer
sent evils is frowned uopn us “crsbhing,” even though
all innovations must be proceeded by the recognition of
existing troubles, as such, and then looking about for a
better method of procedure.

The system of cramming all mid-semester examina-
tions into two days was allowed to run along because
it seemed to work well enough, and it prevented stuv
dents from neglecting those classes which might {all
on the same day as examinations in other courses, if
the days were extended, The faculty realized that
the best work could not be done under such conditions,
and last week the ruling was changed, so that the ex—
amination period now runs through four days.

This is an innovation in the best direction. The
faculty is recognizing what a hardship examinations
are for the average student. In the present system the
work is done and the subject studied so that the exami-
nation may be passed, whereas the examination should
be a means, not an end.

Some professors have fully grasped the evils of the
system and have substituted term papers, which are the
best sltemative orfered so far. The student must have
not only a memory of the course, but also a manipula-
tive knowledge of it to write a good paper. He is not
under the stress of cramming for h two-hour period,
during which he may be asked just those questions
about which he does not have a full understanding by
stead he can study and reﬂect, and then, in the quiet of
his room, write down those reﬂectionsiand a year from
then he still knows the subject.
