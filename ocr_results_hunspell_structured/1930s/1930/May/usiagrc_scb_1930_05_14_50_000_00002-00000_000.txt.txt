THE LIGHT CUT SYSTEM,
Last year a system of having lights turned out at
ten-thirty in cottages of the freshman girls was dis-

punishment have been tried and found effective.

carded because of a petition signed by the girls. This
year it was re—introrluccd, with slightly different provi-
sions for enforcing the rule. A year's trial has proved
it both ineffective and undesirable.

According to this rule, .the girls are themselves to
turn out the lights in their rooms. Each room is al-
lowed one light cut a week. and an inspector is to see
that. except when they are takingithese cuts, the girls
turn out their lights. The result has too often been
that a group of girls having studying to do after hours
collected in the room of someone who was taking her
weekly cut. The amount of studying done in the room
can be imagined.

As time has gone on the enforcement of the rule
has become lax because of its obvious failure to recog~
nize actual conditions. Freshmen, like upper classmen,
frequently have to study after ten-thirty, and a system
based on the contrary assumption is not workable.

The fact that freshmen, both last year and this,
found it impossible to complete their work before ten-
thirty indicates that the light out system is useless as
an attempt to get them to go to bed earlier. The girls
who live in Mears and Central next year should be his
lowed to have their lights in their own rooms, where
they can really study, as often as they need them.

SPOIL THE FROSH?

Not so long ago all parents firmly believed in the
old saying, “spare the rod, and spoil the chil or
late, psychology has pointed out the harms of the
“authority by intimidation" method. Other methods of

There are still some Grinnell men who believe that
the only way to instill respect in a freshman is to pads
die him. These few think that the way to make ,the
freshmen love Grinnell is to make them the personal
slaves of the upper classmen; slaves who have their
choice of minding or being paddled. It is an excellent
example of the type of man who believes that force
rules the world, and that might makes right. This is
the type of man who caused the World war, and who
would arm to the teeth in anticipation of the next
one. He is the greatest menace to humanity.

The day of peddling belongs to a past year. To-
day in all universities of standing, paddling the fresh-
men has gone the way of the “faculty paternalism."
Instead there has entered the idea of making the first
year the one most attractive. and thereby instilling at
the very outset a love of the school into every fresh-
man.

Crinnell is approaching that end. This year prep»
ping has been concentrated into a few days. And pads
dling is at a minimum. There are still a few, however,

who believe in the old order.
