Grinnell Wins
Valley Indoor

Honors Again

lWell-B alancedVarsity Track
Squad Barely Outpoints
Drake Bulldogs.

Was‘hingtonls Thircl

Monrath, Murphy, Pelletier Run
Greet Races; Mile Relay
Team Also Wins.

The first place winner: may get
in The headlines. but it takes seconds,
thirds and fourths to win a meet.

Such may have been the theory of
Coach G. L. Duke when he entered
the Missouri Valley indoor track
meet at the Drake fieldhouse last
Saturday, for his championship Grin—
nell team took only four first places,
but still managed to pick up 41 2-3
unclaimed points and pull them to-
gether to make another title.

The meet proved to be closer than
the more optimistic dopestars had pre»
dicted. Those who pointed to Drake
as a threat despite the overwhelm-
ing loss to Crinnell a week before,
proved to be sounding in the right
channel, for Duke was second with
'55 points and had a chance to take
the meet until the final event was
completed. If Grinneu had failed to
place in the broad jump and Drake
had taken first, it would have meant
that Drake would have taken first by
2-3 of a point. For that matter, if
the judges had accepted the decisions
of many onlookers in‘ the 50—yard
high hurdles, which was as close as
any race could be, Hensley would
have taken a fourth instead of a sec-
ond and again Drake might have
won. The distance men from Okla-
homa displayed their wares in an ef~
fectlve fashion, and most of'their is
1-3 points were at Grinnells' expense.
Washington managed to cut into
some of the Drake points, however,
to bring about the happy ending.

Win Mile Relay

McIlrath, Murphy, Pelletier and the
Grinnell mile relay team brought the
Pioneer first places. The first nam-
red athlete went the mile distance in
4:47 5-10 to come within a second of
the field house record, set by Ray
Conger of lowa State in 1927. Mar
phy continued his policy of cutting his
time in the half mile as he took an
easy victory and Pelletier ran a
sweet race to cut out the Drake
hopes in the quarter mile. The mile
relay was close but the Pioneers prov-
ed to have too much power in their
guns and could not be headed.

Hensley, who trimmed Snorf of
Drake in the high hurdles when run-
ning the DrakerGrinnell dual, dropped
first to the Bulldog hurdler in that
close event Saturday, but took a sec-
ond according to the officials. With
Douglas absent, the Crlnnell high
jumpers battled it out with Wash-
ington in that event, tying for sec-
on and fourth. Crinnell placed in ev-
ery event in taking the victory, and
proved to have without doubt the
most wellrbalanced squad on the field.
No records were broken in the meet
but every event was close and in
doubt until the end.

Three Peace Speakers Talk

lowship committee of the Grinnell

Tracksters Go
to Notre Dame

Duke toTalfe Nine to Ce‘ntral
Intercollegiate Meet

on Saturday.

Missouri valley laurels rest lightly
on the diverse heads of the members
of the Crinnell college track teams,
conference indoor champs, and just
to show that ambition still ' has a
place in this world, they will journey
to the Central Intercollegiate contest
at Notre Dame next Saturday to
make a bid toward annexing another
victory.

Coach G L Duke will take eight
or nine of his more outstanding per-
formers to the midwestern classic
and may romp home with a good
share of the points offered. In case
it is bargain day, the mentor will not
object to taking the meet itself al-
though that is one big order. What-
ever befall's, he is taking one of the
largest squads he has ever taken to
the Central contest.

The mentor will probably use
Thomas in the do yard dash; Pellet-
ier Mark and Thomas in the 440
event; Mcl'lrath in the mile jaunt;
Douglas in the high jump; Hensley in
the high and low hurdles; Murphy in
the 880 and Secor in the two mile
run. -

Pioneer Tennis Team Will Meet Nine ,
Schools on Vacation Trip to Southlandh

While the thoughts of most Crin-
nell men and women have been far
from the wind-swept tennis courts
during the past few months, Crin—
nell’s tennis captain for 1930, Don
Jones, has been passing the hours
with one hand on the racquct and the
other on the typewriter, and this
week revealed that he has arranged
an extensive southern trip for two
Pioneer racqueteers during spring va-
cation. Jones is certain to make the
trip, and will in all probability be ac-
companied by John Kent, a fellow
Swarthmor—ian, with whom Jones has
played doubles from the cradle up, to
say nothing of many gory battles in
the singles.

Provided the Crinnell faculty deem
it advisable to let the duo of net
stars depart for the southlsnd a day
before school dismisses on March 23,
the ‘team will open its ten day trip
with Kansas university at Lawrence,
Kansas, on March 23. The following
day will witness a battle with Okla—
homa university at Norman, Okla—
homa. Sunday will theoretically be a
day of rest for the Pioneer netsters,
although Jones admitted this week
that a certain amount of the game
was necessary each day to remain in
condition.

Will Play Texas.

A full week of playing will start
the following Monday. March 31, with
Oklahoma A. and M. as opponents.
On Tuesday the team will shift to
Fort Worth, where besides inspecting
the fortifications, they will engage in
combat with Texas Christian univer—
sity. On Wednesday, one of the

toughest teams of the trip will be
met at Austin, Texas, in Texas uni-
versity. Last year, with even the rec
doubtable Coggeshall playing for
Crinnell, the Pioneers were forced to
concede Texas a 6-0 win. On the fol-
lowing day, the Texas Aggies will be
met at College Station, Texas, where-
ever that may be, and on Friday the
Grinnellians come up against Rice
Institute at Houston:
To Meet Tulane.

This ends‘ a somewhat prolonged
stay in the Lone Star state, from
which the tennis duo journey to the
city of Mardi Cras, tropic sands and
French Creoles, New Orleans, to
meet Tulane university, which admin-
istered a defeat last year to the Pio-
neer quartet. The journey will be
concluded with a dual against Mis-
souri at Columbia the following Mon-
day and on Tuesday the racqueteers
return home for more serious put»
suits.

A. lack of winter playing has 31*
ways handicapped the Pioneers on
early spring trips, and it is hardly
likely that they will take many of
the matches on their spring trip for
this reason, as last year, even when
Coggey led the team south, they were
unable to win quite half their match-
es, while after returning here and
rounding into condition, the Pioneers
were practically unbeatable. The trip
should serve, however, to give Crin-
nell publicity in the southland, al-
though Jones would not admit this
week that that was after all the main
purpose of the tennis trip to Okla-
homa and affiliated points.

 

Soph Girls Win
Over Freshmen

Fastest Cage Game of Year
Brings Winners Margin
of 27-18 Tuesday“ .

The sophomore team took a 27-18
victory from the freshman sextest
Tuesday afternoon in the fastest
game of this season's Women‘s bas-
ketball tourney. The fresh bas-
keters put up a gallant fight but
were unable to resist the whirlwind
offense of the second year women.

The sophomores started with a.
dash and maintained a slight lead
throughout the first half, which end-
ed 13-10. In the third quarter the
sophomore forwards broke loose on a
scoring spree and piled up a big gain,
which was cut slightly in the last
quarter when the frosh made a. hard—
fought effort to come back.

Good guarding and lightning floor-
work featured the game. Heynen,
freshman captain, starred at center,
and Jensen and Reynolds gave the
sophomore forwards a hard race,
Vance took scoring honors with eight
field goals and one free shot, while
DeLong, frosb forward, was second
with six field tosses. Hansen, sopho-
more captain, showcd plenty of speed
at running center and shavely, also
of the sophomores, played a beautiful
game at guard.

Spanish Table at Quadrangle Finds Dons,

Senoritas Arguing

”Tenge. la bondad de pasarme el
pan," murmurs the scnorlta rolling
her eyes in the approved Spanish
manner.

The handsome don, whose vocabu-
lary is not as good, twirls imaginary
mustache tips. and without a word
throws a piece of bread to the lady
across the table.

This happy tableau is a. regular oc-
currence at the Spanish table, inau—
gurated last night in the quadrangle
dining room. The Spanish table is
to be a weekly accurrence, the second
and third year classes altemating in
the honor. Even the menus are to
be in the tongue of the troubadours.

The purpose is of course to make

in Foreign Language

Orinnell students, so clever in their
own tongue, equally scintillating in
another language. Athletics, poli-
tics, deans, and thc League board
must be discussed exclusively in
Spanish. .For those who revert to
their native language, a ﬁne will be
imposed of a peso or two for each in-
fraction of this rule. When the pro»
Ceeds- of this system mount high
enough, they will be invested in
genuine Spanish candies.

After the meal the banqueters will
hold a brief siesta in the drawing
room, and in accordance with the old
Spanish custom will sing “Cancion del
Piratu" and ask each other Spanish
riddles.

 

 

Watt Has Thirty Players
Out for Spring Football

The thud of the foot against the
pig-skin is again being heard on
the Grinnell campus for the first
time since the Pioneer gridders
packed their pads in'mothball and
adjourned for the winter last
Thanksgiving.

Coach L. L, “Fuzz” Watt started
his spring football practice with
approximately thirty candidates

nual three weeks of intensive
spring drill before spring vacation.

Heldridge, Dewey. Cox, Liedtke
and Rose are among the seniors of
the 1929 squad who are assisting
Coach Watt in directing the men.
Captain Ben Douglas is not in»
cluded in those working with the
oval for he is now performing with
the track candidates, The mentor
expects several more candidates to
report before the end of the week.

Grinnell Loses

Final to Tulsa

After Holding Early Lead,
Cagers Lose Overtime
Game, 30-27.

After setting the pace for the first
half, the Grinnell college quintet lost
its final game of the season. Satur-
day night, to Tulsa university at
Tulsa, by a count of so to 27 in on
overtime fracas, to bring the season‘s
total to 15 games, with six victories.
A pair of seniors, Captain Wilhelm
and Bobby DeLong played their last
basketball for the Pioneers in the
game.

With Ben Douglas setting the scar-
ing pace and playing a crack game
at guard. the Crinnellians took an
ea'riy lead and held it until halftime
with the count of 14 to 10. Coming
back in the second period with a
powerful defense, headed by Captain
Ed Dubie, who scored a’ total 01‘ ll
points in the contest, the Tulsa men
fought their way to a 27 to 27 tie as
the game clased and in the overtime
period scored three points for a vic-
tory.

The Grinnell cagers were unable to
round into their best play under the
close officiating and were guilty of
17 fouls during the game as compar-
ed with the nine mlsplays by the
winners. Consequently, although
Crinncll scored 12 field goals to the
11 by Tulsa, the home outfit scored
eight gift shots to Grinnell’s three,

Debaters to Meet
S. Dakota Thursday

Tomorrow evening the University
of South Dakota will debate here in
the last schcduled argument of the
season. The advertising question will
be discussed, Gtinnell's negative team
appearing on the local platform.
John shoddy, Jonathan Danfortb and
Edward Spencer make up the team.
The debate will take place in the A.
R. H. auditorium at 7:30.

Monday afternoon Richard Phillips,
Francis Hawk, and Robert Blasier
participated in a nonrdecision debate
against a trio of Ames students on
the subject: “Resolved that the ads
vcrtising of commodities as practiced
in the United States today by manus
facturers, wholesalers and dealers is
more harmful than beneﬁcial to So—
ciety.” The debate was given before
the Ames Women’s club in the base-
ment of the city library. The Grin-
nell trio upheld the negative side of
the argument, and the Ames debaters
the affirmative.

The principle arguments of the
Ames debaters were that advertising
is too expensive, that it is wrong
ethically in that much of it is un-

« truthful, and that it encourages peo-

ple to buy more than they can afford,
The Grinncll team maintained that
advertising is an intergal part of our
present economical system, that its
beneﬁts greatly outweigh its harmful
effect, and that a change for the bet-
Ler is taking place in advertising.
