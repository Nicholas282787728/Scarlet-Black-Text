“The Marriage Playground"
with Frederic March, Mary Brian.

A Paramount production. Appear-

ing at the Strand tonight, Thul‘Se

day and Friday,

Though an economics professor
may jest at the problem of increasing
population, Edith Wharton takes a
much more humanitarian attitude in
her novel, “The Children," from
which the “Marriage Playground" is
adaptedThe settings are rich; the
clothes are correct, and the cocktails
smell light: You win remember
Fredric March as the professor who
neglected his class for the doshhzg

Clam Bow in “The Wild Party."

“The lilbitnerv with Harry
Green, Mary Brian, Nell Hamli—
ton. A Paramount production
Appearing at the Colonial to-
night, Thursday, and Friday.

The proper definition of a “kibib
zer” is the guy that would light the
matches while his girl changed the
tire—he’s the fellow that suggests
that you might have finessed that
lost trick in short, he’s the reason
for dormitories at a. fraternity school.
But when a. kihitzer gets mixed with
the stock market and becomes tang-
led up in the tape, it’s funny, Mary
Brian, said to be the ideal oi many
college boys, handles her part nice-
ly.

“Say It With Songs” with Al
Jolson, Marion Nixon, Davey Lee.
A Warner Bros. production. Ap-
pearing at the Strand Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.
Mr. Jolson shows a constantly im—

provcd presence before the micro—
phone with each of his talkie pic-
tures. This time Al is found employ-
ed In a. IMHO station Working toward
the top for his wife and child. nut
marriage doesn't end at the ﬁlter as
some fiction would have us believe
and Hohnes Herbert enters, Best
shot: Al singing “Why Can't You?"
in prison. From this show came the
songs “Little Pal," “I’m in Heaven"
and “Why Can't You." This is the
first Jolson picture, we believe, to be
screened in Grinnell.

“Devil-May-Care" \‘Vith Rﬂnlon
Navarro and Dorothy Jordan. An
M G M production. Appearing at
the Colonial Saturday, Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday.

Following Bonapart’s exile to Eb
ha, one of his lieutenants, Armand
(Navarro), is captured and sen-
tenced to death, His escape brings
him to a room in a roadside inn. A
demure Royalist maid (Jordan) un-

 

intentionally hides him. She reveals
his presence to the searching party
because of her patriotic devotion. But
Armand never forgets her,

History and Waterloo are barely
respected. The purpose is comedy. A
reproduction of the gardens of Ver-
sailles is done in Technicolor. Na,»
varro’s singing is pleasing.

Navarro becomes infinitely more
atractive in this film which marks
his talkie debut.
