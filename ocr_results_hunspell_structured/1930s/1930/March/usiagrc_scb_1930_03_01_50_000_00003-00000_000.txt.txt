THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Iowa State 25$ "Parity E‘Ivgrazossr'stment Should

Pioneers Swim

By Eleanor Noon.

“Parity. Any parity except that
or zero is a crazy notion," said Nor—
man Thomas in speaking of the pre-
sent London Naval conference in an
interview Thursday. “At this mo»
ment, the conference is going rather
badly,” he said, “but I am still hope-
ful that some good will come from
it. There will be good in any check
of competitive armament. While
we are blaming France and Italy for
the failure of the conference, we
should remember that it was the
United States who blocked limita—
tion of the battleshipsithe one ob-
vious easy thing to do away with.

"There is justice in the French
statement that the United states
should state deﬁnitely how she stands
regarding the Kellogg Pact. It
would be a. reasonable thing for us
to say whether or not we would con-
tinue to carry on trade with any na-
tion breaking the pact.

“This whole parity business from
logical standpoint is silly. It
would be much more simple to place
parity at zero, If we had not pro-
posed such an elaborate scheme of
naval disarmament, France would
have been in a harder position to ins
sist upon her submarines. It is an
illustration of the folly of practical
wisdom. Complete naval disarma—
ment is much more sensible than any
parity. It is not one or two men

what the results of this dampening
may he is being determined this af-
ternoon.

Just as the Pioneer trackmen are
doped to take first in the Missouri
Valley indoor meet, so the Grinnell
swimmers have been doped to romp
home second against Iowa state in
swimming today. At an early writ-
,ing, it would seem that the Grim
nellians would have little choice, for
men from Ames boast a Big Six
title, a diving and a 100 yard cham—
pion.

The Ames outfit will be the big
show this afternoon with the Grin— a
nellians hanging around the outside
of the tent and picking up the scat-
tering points in most events today.
There are a. few, however, in which
the Pioneers will captivate the spot—
light. One of these will be the work
of that . chubby distance demon,
Drennan Miller, who is likely to take
a first, and his teammate, Art Cox,
who-has been struggling right along
over the 440 yard distance lately,

 

Be Placed at Zero,’ Affirms Thomas

who are to blame~hnt the nations.

“If we had more sense we would
realize that air disarmament is more
important than naval anyway. In
the next war there will be more
danger from the air. However it
would be hard to adopt rules of air
disarmament. Planes could quickly
and easily he fitted out with guns if
needeli. Disarmament in itself is
not a sufficient panacea against wars
fit cannot stop them."

In speaking of our failure to re»
cognize Russia, Mr. Thomas said, “I
believe that before the recent tight-
ening of the dictatorial power there,
we would have soon recognized her.
Now there will probably be consider-
able delay. There can be no sound
international basis or peace as long
as countries fail to recognize one of
the largest nations.”

While Mr, Thomas did not believe
that it would have been a wise plan
for the United states to have enter»
ed the League of Nations in 1919 be
cause other nations would have
sought'to use it for an instrument
to enforce the Treaty oi Versailles,
he does believe that we should join it
now, "on conditions making for
peace, but not being willing to en
force it by war. The democratic, not
the imperialistic attitude of the
League should be strengthened; em-
phasizing it as an organ of interna-
tionalism.”

A number of interesting observa-

the grades of Grinnell men, as re-

dents is 302, whose average number
of credit hours carried is 15.18. The

The average grade points per
credit hour for men holding college
jobs was a little below that of the
total men in college; the scholarship,
however of college employed men is
superior to that of the town men,
and that of dormitory men even
more superior.

There are four buildings above the
grade point per student and grade
point per credit hour averages of the
college men as a unit. The two
buildings at the bottom of both av»

the scores of the rest of the build-

evenly matched, especially when it
is considred that either Drake or
