Soph Girls Defeat
.Senior Cagers, 32-5'

The sophomore girls’ sextet upset
the seniors in a 32 L0 5 basketball
victory Thursday “afternoon. The
seniors put up a good defense but
were soon worn out by the whirl-
wind team work of the sophomores.
The underclassmen gained the leadv
early in the game and held it
throughout.

The deciding game of the girls
tourney will be played next Week
when the sophomores meet the jun-
iors in a night game. Both of these
teams are leading the league, having
beaten both the freshmen and The
.Seniors.

Deportment, Foreign Languages—

These Were Woes in Days of ’72

 

The, students who attended Iowa
college (the former name of Grins
nell) in the seventies did not giggle
when the wag of the class walked
in late, nor whisper and talk
throughout the recitation period.
The college catalogue of 1872
carries the warning- that ”graduation
of students will be determined by
examination marks, recitation
marks, and deportment marks take
en together . . . A record of departs
inent is kept, as well as of recita-
tions. and the accumulation of de-
merit marks is properly noticed.”

Our modern co-eds, who consider
themselves the peers if not the
equals of the men students. should
not forget that less than sixty years
ago women were admitted to college
“with due regard to constitutional
differences and suitable safeguards."
The "suitable safeguards” appear to
be the omitting of Greek from the
curriculum of the Ladies' course, and
the teaching of only “select authors"
in the French classes. While the
men studied zoology, chemistry, as»
tronomy. the young ladies studied
household science, mental science,
and listened to lectures on chemistry
and botany, which were properly at-
tuned to the feminine ear.

And how would the modern youth
who finds the present college curri-
culum far too limited. with too many
requirements and restrictions, have
liked going to college in the day
when the freshman year included
Greek, Latin, and mathematics in
the Classical course} or the alterna-
tive of studying science, physical
science. and mathematics in the Sci-
entific course? In his sophomore
year the student of that day added
“Belles Lettres” to his other three
courses. In the junior .and senior
years French and mental science
were substituted for “Belles Lettres."
The scientific students also had
the option of choosing between ap—
plied mathematics ancl applied sci~
enccs. A strident who did not wish
to pursue this limited course, prob
ably the counterpart of the modern

The changing of the minute rule
in the quadrangle recently is a far
cry from the original rule of the col-
lege. Under the heading of "de—
portment of students" we learn
that the young blade of 1870 could
call on his lady fair "only during the
vacation of study hours on Saturday
afternoon, except by special permis-
sion of the faculty."

Organizations

This 's the seventh of a series
of or cles which the SCARLET
AND BLACK is publishing on
various campus orgoni itious.

organizations on the campus, the
glec club has made an enviable reps
utation during the past two decades
under the leadership of Prof. David
F. Peck, though even before he
took over the directorship the glee
club had traveled to the Pacific
coast and made the name of Grinnell
known over a large part of the coun-
try.

Under Mr. Peck. the glee club has
continued to hold up its high stand-
ards. Its programs are known for
their high quality; its reputation!
reached perhaps its highest point
when it won the Western Intercol—
legiate Glee cluh contest at Chicago
in 1924, and took third in the na—

 

tional contest in New York City. Al-
ways the club has endeavored to live
up to its motto: “Best in the West."

The club is composed of twenty-
four members and four alternates
and to its membership any man in
school is eligible. Vacancies are fill-
ed at the beginning of the school
year, after a series of tryouts, by
ele'ction on the part of the old mem-
bers of the club. Two regular fea-
tures of the club‘s program each
year are its home concert and its
Commencement concert given on the
steps of Blair hall the night of grad-
uation day.

Women’s Glee Club: To this or-
ganization goes the reputation of
having one of the highest esprit a.
corps of any group on the campus;
its members work together faithfulr
ly and consistently each year to
maintain the high standards set by
glee clubs of years past; those who
belong to-it have pointed out the
unifying effect which it gives its

 

members. A large share of credit
for this fine spirit goes to Prof.
George 1.. Pierce, who as director of
the club for many years in the past
has permitted the girls to sing noth-
ing but the highest ype of music,
and who has used his musical know-
ledge to weld the club into an har—
monious whole each year.

Membership in the club is based
upon a girl’s musical ability, her
scholastic standard and her personr
ality. This year the club is taking
a five day trip during spring vaca-
tion through eastern Iowa and west-
ern Illinois; its annual home concert
is to be given next Friday night. At
Commencement time it also gives, a
concert which is looked forward to
by visitors and seniors as much as
is the men's concert.
