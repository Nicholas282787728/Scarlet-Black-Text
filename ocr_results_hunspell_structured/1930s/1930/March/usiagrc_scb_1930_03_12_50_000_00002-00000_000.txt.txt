ATHLETICS AND HIGH GRADES

A great many people believe that scholarship and
athletics are as different from one and another as wat-
er is from oil. They believe that a. runner or a. basket-
ball star spends four -fifths of his time in the gymnas—
ium and the other one—fifth in seeing that his grades
and eligibility regulations harmonize.

Whether or not this be true sometimes, it is not al-
ways true, and the Grinnell track team is the proof in
the' matter. From an article in todays issue of the
paper it is stated that: during the first. semester his
group of athletes received an average or 1.595 grade
points per credit hour, .095 more than any of the mens

dormitories or the town men.

Managing Editor

Hunter colleg%The decision that
short skirts are best has been resch-
ed by the journalism club of Hunter
college, the largest college for wo-
men in the word. Seventy per cent
declared that long skirts are a nui-
sancc and are to be tolerated only
at formal affairs.

Leave, Ol'LIGYS Early,

At ﬁrst thought one would believc that this track
team, judging from the grade point average, could not
also excel on the track, but this, too, is proven false
When it is remembered that this Eﬂ'oup Walked off with
first honors at the Missouri Valley Indoor Track meet
in Des Moines loss than two weeks ago. The week pre.
ceding, the Grinhell runners beat the Drake Bulldogs
in a. dual meet at the Des Moines fieldhouse. Last Week
the men turned in good times in the Central intercol.
legiotc track meet held at South Bend. Saturday the
men go to the Illinois relay where they are expected to
make a good showing.

This excellence on the track and in the class room
proves that it is not impossible for good grades and
othlctic supremacy to go hand in hand and is at least
a partial refutation of those Critics of college athletics
who claim that competitive collegiate sports today
necessarily mean neglect of ,the scholarly pursuits
which form the fundamental purpose of attendance at
college. In the words ot the popular song, let us say
to the track men, "We offer you congrutulations."

TmiEE JUDGES.

Again the Pioneer Prudities have_come and passed.
The many hours spent in rehearsing are over and those
who contributed in making the third annual program
a success are once more at ease and making up last
weeks lessons. The decisions have been made and
the prizes have been awarded,

According to an old saying, “You can't satisfy
everybody,” and so it was in the decision of the win«
ners in this college frolic. Many students as,Well as
faculty and others had their own opinions about the
acts. Whereas some agreed exactly with the judge's
decision, others could not see his point of view at all
and therefore thought he was prejudiced or entirely
wrong.

May it be clearly understood that this is not a.
criticism of the decision of the acts which took place
last Friday night, for none of us would dare to claim
that We are the dramatic critic that Mr. Jernagin is.
He judged the skits exactly as he felt they should be,
and his decision was just, for the acts were Wellvenough
presented to have been awarded ﬁrst place. However,
another judge might have handed in an entirely differ-
ent rating.

Speaking of sayings, there is another, "Two heads
are better than one.“ Accordingly the students feel
that the task of judging the Pioneer Prudities should
be given to three or more critics who, it is believed,
could render a decision which everyone would accept
as being more representative than that of just one judge.
Football games and other athletic contests have more
than one judge, especially those which are of any im-
portance.

The fact that nearly one hundred students spent the
last two weeks in preparing for the Prudities shows
ithat this affair is no small matter ICD the dorms and
cottages. Accordingly they want as fair ii. judging as
is possible to be given. No doubt the Pmdities
will be as well produced next year as they were
this year, and the students will want as iair an
evaluation as can be given. By placing the judging in
the hands of several, the students feel that any per.
sonal prejudices which one judge might have will be

overcome by the other two.
