Convention

By KENNETH CLAYTON
(Campus Editor, Scarlet and Black)

CONVENTION HALL, COLUM-
BUS, 0.——Journhlists from Oregon to
Florida, college newspaper men from
California to Cornell, stationed them-
selves at their respective places here
Monday and prepared for the three—
day session of the Sigma Delta Chi
convention.

No one could mistake the gather-
ing. The air of the room was cloudy
with smoke, half of the delegates
were wearing their hats, tilted back
on their heads, and all chewed their
pencils as they listened to reports and
speeches.

Like Endurance Contest

After Monday's sesions and the
dance Monday night, at which three
of the four Crinnell delegates were
keeping well occupied with Tri-Delts
and the fourth busied himself with a
girl living in the city. the crew ap<
peared decidedly less ambitious as
the delegates lolled about in commit—
tee meetings.

While the convention proper at
this stage seems to have reached the
stage of on endurance contest, the
Grinnell delegation, four strong, is
holding up with remarkable strength.
Pity those who have only one repre—
sentative present. He can't do it
justice,

Major Should be Offered

Blair Converse, head of the depart-
ment of technical journalism at
Iowa State college, Amos, who spoke
in Grinnell last Friday at the press
convention, reported on schools pc—
titioning for chapters Monday morn-
ing, and from requirements outlined
by him, Grinnell’s Chapter will be
hard put to hold its place with the
national group.

Amon‘g’ other requirements, he said.
that the schools should offer a major
in journalism with at least 50 upper
olassmen taking that major. He re-
ported unfavorably on Southern
Methodist university. primarily be-
cause that school has only about is in
the journalism department.

Visit Ohio Penitentiary

Southern Methodist has a, repre—
sentative on the ground here, bow<
ever, and he appeared before the con—
vention yesterday morning to present
his case. It is, of course, impossible :
to predict what action will be taken.
but general indications seem to fa—
vor admittance of the Texas school. i

Routine business occupied the
meeting Monday morning, and the .
delegates were entertained by the

Eight Scarlet and Black Football Men
’ Will Have Played Last Game Friday

Three years ago Grinnell football
dopesters looked over freshman grid
prospects and predicted that in three
years the Pioneers would have an-
other great football team like that
of 1926, which won the Missouri val-
lcy conference championship and
made its name feared in the middle-
west.

Friday night eight seniors will have
played their last game under the
scarlet and black colors, and al-
though their toani did not come up to
the expectations of some \experts,
still it is a great team.

l-Iiml Schedule This Year

A hard schedule, one of tho stiffest
in years, coupled with the jinx of in»
juries, has been responsible for the
loss of four games this year. But
still the team is great, because .it
has continued to build up the repu—
tation that Crinnell is especially to
be feared in the last quar-
ter, and that a Pioneer team never
quits,

When next fall rolls around, Coach
Lester Watt will have to build the
Pioneers anew, with Capt Ben Doug—

 

his leadership alone.

Converse Advises
Students to Write
‘Familiar Things’

That a high school, in a way, is a
separate country with its own govern-
ment, its own rules, and its own sys-
tems of conduct, was the point ems
phasized by Prof. Blair Converse, head
of the department of technical jour-
nalism at Iowa. State college, Amos,
in a talk before the Iowa High School
Press association delegates Friday
morning at 10 in the Alumni Recita-
tion hall auditorium.

Professor Converse enumerated two
functions of the high school news
paper- in his address on “Problems of
High School Papers." The first was
the advancement of school spirit and
morale of the studenm, and the sec-
ond, the practical experience in joulv
nalistie work.

“Write about familiar things,“ the
Amcs man advised the convention of
journalists, “a student should try
all departments of the school paper to
learn what sort of work he is best fit—
ted to do."

Victorious Season

After Slow Start on Basketball Court

kethall men playing football permits,

With the first encounter on the slit-
tcen game schedule, Coe at Cedar
Rapids, coming only a week after
Thanksgiving, the Grinnell mentor
plans on heavy workouts for his
squad during the first two weeks of
practice.

Ruff, Humphrey Out

Five lcttermen, Captain
Humphrey, Douglas, Minicr, and
McCrcary, are back this year. All
five of the veterans have been play-
ing football, and Humphrey and Ruff
will be on tho bench for at least the
early part of the season due to injur-
ics received during the football sce-
son. Humphrey broke his hand in
the Cornell game last week, while
Ruff was laid up with a twisted knee
in tlic Creighton encounter.

A quartet from last year's fresh»

Ruff,

 

 

man outfit, Duncan, Strslcy, Wolf—
inger, and Davis, have been working
out daily, and these men are expert-
ed to provide plenty of opposition for
varsity berths. Ullrich and James

son's frosh squad that will report
for practice at the end of the foot—
ball season.
Ccoch rredicts Success

Ullrich played on the Detroit Young

won the national basketball title in
1923. “Snap” James, hot shot in
Cedar Rapids during his high school
days, is due to see considerable ac-

Rowe, Blasier, and Lamb.

Coach Trucsdcle plans on having
the best cage teem since he has been

everything works out right." Last
year the Pioneers could do no better
than tie with Drake for third place in
the Missouri Valley conference, while
Creighton and Washington earned
titles of cochampions.
