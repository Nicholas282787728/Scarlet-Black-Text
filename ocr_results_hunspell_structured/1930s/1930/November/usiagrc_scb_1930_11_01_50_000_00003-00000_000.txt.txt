The freshman team may not look
so good against the Griiinell varsity,

ped by the foot that their regular
team is never on the field as a unit.
When they do manage to get to
gether, they look pretty good. Coach
John Truesdale was heard to remark
that this year‘s bunch was the best
frosh outﬁt that Grinnell has had for
three years.

The first year men have been pros
viding opposition for both the ver-
sity and the second team. The vet-
eiiins have experienced little difficulty
in making gains through the fresh-
inan team but that is to be expected
when the frosh are continually on dos
fense. They have little or no oppor-
tunity to use their offense,

The line shows some good men, too.
Crews and Weleh, both Grinnell city
men, are capable ends; Lake and Ent
are develop'mg into fair tackles, while
Rosenbloom and Gleysteen are hold-
ing down the guard berths. Faunee
and Campbell are after the center
pos ion.
