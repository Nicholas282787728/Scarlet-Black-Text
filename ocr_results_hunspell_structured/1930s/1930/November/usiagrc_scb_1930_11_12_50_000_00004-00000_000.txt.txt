only one of the 17 passes was completed by the Pioneers. About 4,500 per-

sons saw the starlight contest.

Dr. AI Sharpe’s proteges lost their’

best chance to score in the ﬁrst quar-
ter, when a fumble on Grinnell’s four
yard line gave the Pioneers the hall.
in the third quarter a fumble by Grin<
nell within scoring distance of the
east goal cost a touchdown, While a
second close attempt at scoring was
also missed on account of fumbling
at the west end of the gridiron as
the gun sounded to end the game.

Saussele Crashes Over

In the matter of ﬁrst downs. Grin-
nell led with eight to seven gained
by Washington. The Bears, however,
completed three of their four passes
while Grinnell completed only one of
17 tried.

The winning touchdown came in
the third quarter when Washington
showed its only real ﬂash or attack.
Saussele ran 13 yards and then

' passed to Hornsby for 14 more.

sele, on a run, brought it to the one—
