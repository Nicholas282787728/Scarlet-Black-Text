It seems that Grinncll students
have for years been committing a
grave error by wearing the usual

rough and ready wearing apparel for
picnics. Lucy Roberts and John Heuer
recently demonstrated the smart at-
tire for such occasions. Black kid
gloves, fur coats, and the latest thing
in felt hats and afternoon footwear
are absolutely essential.

We think that an injustice has
been rendered Leta itiniker in that
she has not been irii ated into the

one girl in a thousand can call up
the business men in our city and
successfully carry on negotiations
for electric typewriters, pigeon’s
milk, ostrich plume fans, and
sleeping beds for sick children.

All But Butz in Shape

Ollie Dc Victor, trainer of the
Washington football squad, stated
Monday that. with the exception of
the slight injury to Butz, every mem
ber of the squad came through the
Drake game in very good shape.
Unless some regular is injured d
ing the week in the scrimmage ses-
sions, the Bears should take the
field Saturday night with every
regular in the game ready to fight
on minutes against Grinnell without,
displaying any signs of Llrillg, and
calling for time out but seldom.

Bilto‘Returns
to First ‘Team

The Grinnell college football team,

fresh from victories over Carleton
and Creighton, will attempt to
add another school to its “have-co ;
quered" list, when it meets Washing-
ton university at st. Louis Saturday
night.
‘ Pioneer prospects are not as bright
as they might be with Ruff, stellar
passer and kicker, nursing serious ins
Juries received in the Creighton game
here Friday night. He may, if his
knee improves rapidly, see some ac
tion against the Washington Bears,
but it is doubtful whether the coaclr
ing staff will use him unless his pass-
ing is needed,

 

The presence of Bilto in uniform
yesterday afternoon bolstered some-
what the hopes ot the squad,
He has been out of practlnel
since he sprained his ankle in the
Drake game. The rest of the squad
is in good condition.

The regulars looked good Monday
afternoon when it took them just
three plays to score on the freshman
team. Coach “Fuzz” Watt seemcrll
satisfied with their brief perform-
ance. and sent them to the showers
immediately after the touchdown.

Light Scrimnmgcs Planned 1

Yesterday afternoon saw the first
string mcn scrimniaging against a
combination of scrubs and freshmen.
End runs and long passes, featuring
Thomas, were in evidence. Realizing
that too much practice at this stage
in the season might prove fatal, the
Grinnell mentor will take no chances
on over working his men, and only
light scrimmages are the program
for the rest of the week.

It is expected that Coach Watt will
use the same team that he has start—
ed so far this season, with the em
ception of Hensley who will be at
right end, and ullrien and MeCreary
in the backfield. The rest of the team
will be Christoffcrsen at center. Norr
ton and Bradford, guards; uinier at
left end; Humphrey and Walker,
tackles; Thomas at quarter, and Caps
toin Douglas at fullback.
