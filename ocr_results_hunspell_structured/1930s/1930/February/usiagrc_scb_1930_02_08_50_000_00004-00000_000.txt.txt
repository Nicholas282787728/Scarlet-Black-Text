This is the fourth of a series of
articles which the SChRLE‘I‘;
AND BLACK is publishing on the
various campus organizations. The
hr cs are intended to giye n bet-
ter undershinding oi the purposes,
duties, fruictinns imll nature of the
memberships of the various rnnr
pus groups health with. in n re-
cent issue the Honor “a" and the
Women's Athletic associntion

article tells of Men's Forensic

Men‘s Forensic: As the organiza-
tion in charge of all student speech
activities on the campus . en's For-
ensic both sponsors such activities
and maintains an active program for
rtnclf its a distinct group. Composed
of twenty members, it fills vacancies
in the group by competitive tryouts
in the late fall, it meets twice
monthly for dinner. and later holds
meetings in which topics of interest
to college men are discussed. Under
a plan introduced this year, some of
thr- meetings are informal discuss»
ions, some are of the formal type.
where parliamentary rules hold
sway It held last year an all—Cole
lcge stag dinner, and will likely hold
a similar function again this year.

Some idea of the range of topics
discussed at the meetings of For-
ensic may be gotten from a glance
at the program of the first meeting
after the new semester starts. Talks
are scheduled on "The Required
Courses of a College Education,”
”Direct Selling" and "An Analysis of
Grinnell Graduate while at the
following meeting will be discussed
"The Organization of School Activi-
lies," “The Coal industry," “Person-
nel Work in Manufacturing Cen—
ters," “Dlplomacy.” Forensic thus
invades in its discussions the fields
or politics, business, foreign Telhe
trons, school activities and many
other fields.

The organization sponsors the Mer-
rill debates in the fall, the varsity
debates in the winter and in the past
two years has sent undergraduate
speakers to many schools in the mid—
dle west, whose reports on conditions
on other campuses has been full of
interest to Crinnell students. To
become a member of Men's Forensic,
however, it is not necessary to be
a lllzbater or go out for debate.
Membership is based on interest in
speech activities and spirited discus~
sions of the type used la the meet-

PORTER’

ings.

Four facility members are always
members of the organization. At
present they include Professors

,Charlton, Mack, Spencer and Lovell.

Mr. Rupert Hawk, debate coach, is
also a member of the group.
VVolnen'5 ForensiCreOl-ganlzed in
the fall of 1927, Women’s Farenslc
holds a place in sponsorlng speech
activities for Women similar to that
of Men's Morensic for Grinnell men.
Composed of about twelve members
chosen on the basis of tryouts, Wom-
en's Forensic last year began the
intercottage debates. corresponding
with the Merrill debates, sponsored
the women-s varsity debates with
Carleton and Rockford, and honored

lthem with a reception in the drawing

room afterwards.

During the winter, the society en-
tertained Men's Forensic at a dinner
in the quadrangle, and in the spring
sponsored the Women’s Spaulding
contest for interpretive reading and
the Hill contest for extemporaneous
speaklng. -

Its meetings, held semiemonthly,
are of the same general nature as
are the men's meetings. Topics of
interest to girls are the vogue in
such meetings, and opportunity is
given for the same spirited discuss-
ions which characterize the meetings
of Men’s Forensic.

Payne Talks About

“Ndﬁonallljs,” a distorted type of
nationalism which involves the hat-

favor of peace, but declared that the
causes of war are not in arms, but
in other factors. They denied that
disarmament is the solution to the
problem, What that solution ls, has
not yet been foreseen, but that dis-
armament is a present practical, the
Crinnell debaters declared to be un-
true.
