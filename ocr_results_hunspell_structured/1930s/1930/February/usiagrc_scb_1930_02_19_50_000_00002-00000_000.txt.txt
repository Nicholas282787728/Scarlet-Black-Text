THE CHAPEL SITUATION,

Last fall the Scarlet and Black announced as one
of its policies: “We shall strive to uphold the chapel
service and to discover means of remedying the low at-
tendance at this service." Today this paper begins c
campaign to discover just what student sentiment is
upon the whole question. The purpose of this editorial
is to outline just what the problem is, and to ask the
cooperation of every student in Grinnell in making this
investigation a success."

No one will deny ‘that one of the astounding de-
velopments of the past few years has been the decreas-
ing interest on the part of college students in' religious
services of any kind. Grinnell has faced it in diminish»
Is it

’many."

THE GIiiLNNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

true that Grinnell students no longer fool the need of
a short period of quiet and mcditation each day, a period
that will aid them to start the day, or ﬁnish it, with
just a little added depth in their lives? We hope not,
but if the situation exists, the truth should be faced
and some attempt made to analyze the situntion. Votc
truthfully on the ﬁrst question!

Perhaps, many say, the student body would attend
chapel better but for the present hour. That is the
opinion of many in the Campus Opinion today. Now
while the administration does not consider a return to
the ten O‘clock hour feasible, yet it is willing to con-
sider or change to twelve o'clock.

Granting the service desired, the hour satisfactory,
thc program has much to do with attendance at chapel.
At the comparatively few chapel services we have at
tended this year the speakers or musical programs have
been unusually good; nevertheless, the ballot printed tar
day offers the chalice for any comment or suggestion
for improvement in chapel programs.

We believe that the majority of Grinnell students
are sincerely interested in keeping up the standards of
this college. While believing ourselves that the
chapel service is a tra lvuon which should be maintain-
ed and supported, we agree that to some the mainten-
ance of the chapel service might not seem vitally im-
portant. All that we ask in presenting this ballot is
that the student body cooperate, vote sincerely, and keep
in mind whatever interest th'ey may have in forwarding
Grinnell's standards. To take this investigation Serr
iously will be merely another manifestation of that Grin-
nell spirit that fought Washington to a standstill last
Saturday evening and which is going to beat Drake this
Friday. E. D. A.

A BALL FOR WOMEN!

The Colonial Ball, sponsored by the W. A. A., will be
held Saturday evening. One of the loveliest of social
events for women, a group of traditions hove grown up
around it. No one is permitted on the floor unless in
costume; a deﬁnite program is followed and spectators
and girls alike remember the beauty of the final ﬁrefly

waltz. ,
Men, and those women who do not attend in cos-

tume, may observe the ball as spectators. In order
that the ball may retain the distinctive event that it isi
the one costume dance of the year for women only—they
should remember that the dancing at the colonial
ball is for women in costume only.

HEAR STL‘Z TONIGHT.

For the past two weeks, Grinnell students and
faculty have been hearing the delightful lectures by
Dr. Walter Silz on German romanticism. These lectures
have for most of us either opened a new ﬁeld of litera-

ture or greatly enlarged a rather vague conception of.

what the movement really was. . Primarily, however,
they have made us more appreciative of a great literary
period in another country.

This evening Dr, Silz will give an illustrated lecture
at the chapel on “Romantic Towns of Southern Ger-

hing, written by a member of the
School of Music faculty.

Among those of foreign birth who
have built themselves into the was
tic life of America, Georges Barrera.
of Paris, brought to our shores by
Walter Damrosch twenty-five years
ago, has given the greatest impetus
to the cultivation of chamber music
combinations other than strings.

Four times he has brought to Grin—
nell the results of his genius; in the
Trio de Lutece, (Harp, 'Cello, Flute),
The Woodwind Ensemble, each once,
and the Barrerre Little Symphony
twice.

Each time Gn'hnell’s appreciation,
not only of Barrere, the world’s
greatest flutist, but of his friendly
and enthusiastic personality, has in—
creased until we now greet him as
one who speaks to us through his
intimate art as few others have done.

His contribution last Monday eve-
ning was a program not to be tots
gotten, because of the- power of
Barrera to interpret life to us as re-
corded in the works of the masters,
which were the medium of express-
Ion.

I Campus Opinion

l
l

Quesh‘on:—Stutc your opinion of
returning to the program of ten o’-
clock chapel, keeping in mind the
eight o'clock chapels of the year, null
tho ten o’clock clmpels ol the past
week.

Curleton Humphreyil believe Len
o’clock chapel would be much more
popular. I used to go occasionally,
and I think there are lots of others
who Went at ten but will not go ztt
eight.

Edward Brown 7 Ten o'clock
Chapel, of course. The spiritual in—
spiration derived,from those twenty
minutes makes the following two
hours more proﬁtable.

Cirikt Slngieil like ten o'clock
Chapel better, I Went Lhen and real-
ly enjoyed it, NOW that it’s at eight
o'clock, I stay home and sleep.

Temple Bentlein don't like the
idea. if anyone wants to go to
chapel he can get up. Eight O’clock
gives the unreligious people more
time to sleep,

Esther Collette—To walk across
the campus early in the morning
gives one that fresh and invigorating
feelingilet’s keep chapel at eight.

John Canning—I suggest that the
morning chapel service be returned
to the ten o’clock period after spring
vacation. I fear that the test given
to eight o’clock chapel has cut down
on the attendance of both the facultyi
and the student body.

Ruth Horine—I don’t like ten o'-
clock chapel. The break in morning
classes, whether it be for pleasure
(as over half the schrml make it.) or
for more serious things, interrupts
the train of thought.

Kenneth ClaytoniTo me eight o'-
clock chapel seems quite adequate.

Frances R2271 prefer ten o'clock
because those who have no eight
twenty classes are not likely to go
to chapel at eight.

French Drama

‘Les Deux Sourds’ Is Name
Clever One-Act Play
Last Night.

By Elcnnor Noon.

Four “Gl‘inhell made” French char-
acters jabbered away convincingly in
the one act ploy ”Les Deux Sourds”,
(the Two Deaf Men), by Molhaux,
which was given in A.R.H. auditorium
at 7115 last evening.

Walter Secor, playing the part of
the deaf father. Domoisesu, paced
up and down the stage vigorously ex»
pressing his determination that his
only daughter, Eglantine, Who‘ was
represented by Helen Lovejoy, should
merry only a deaf man. He looked
like a true anchman with his green
waistcoat and long flowing black
satin tie. His acting ﬁtted the part
perfectly.

Helen LOvejOy succeeded well in
Showing the Stubborn outburst of
temper cf the only daughter who had
to Wait for a deaf man to make his
appearance before she could marry.

Plot is Humorous.

Ben Hensley, as Boniface, the but
ler, was at his best when he called
the deaf father most uncomplimenr
tary names behind his back, in a
most realistic manner.

Theodore Gleysteen, as Placide,
who pretends that he is deaf in order
tO Win Eglantine, entered most dra-
matically. The gun which he shoots
while rabbit hunting nearly scared
the good sized audience from the
room., Boniface and /the father pro»
ceed out of the window after him
armed with a gun and dust mop.

Domoiseau regains his hearing,
hears Boniface calling him names,
and demands that Eglantine marry
