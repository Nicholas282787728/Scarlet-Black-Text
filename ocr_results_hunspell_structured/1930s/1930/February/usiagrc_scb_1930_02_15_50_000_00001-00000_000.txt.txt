Nation Needs
New Church,
Says Brooks

Names Three Contributions
of America to Religion '
in Final Talk.

Religion Popularized

By Denominationahsm, Education,
and Democracy, Have Given

Religion to People.

“It is my dream," said Dr. Brooks
‘in the dual Gates' Lecture given by
him in the chapelr yesterday morn—
ing," that America may free herself
from denominationalism and that
out of the present confusion, a new
church may rise which will combine
all the best features of the present
denominations.” The topic of the
lecture was, “America's Contribution
to Religion."

“America has succeeded in doing
three things,“ asserted Dr. Brooks.
“She has succeeded in breaking the
bond of state control, has' broken
away from ecclesiastical formalism,
and has freed herself from the power
of the old intellectual tradition.

“America has thus formed new
channels to take religion from the

church to the street, and iS the only ‘

land in which these channels are fully
open. Such channels have been
opened because of Hum things,
namely, dcnominotionalism, the spirit
of democracy, and the American sys-
tem of education." »
Denominations Add to Life

Dr. Brooks dwelt on the contribu-
tions of denominationalism to Tell-
gion in this country by pointing out
certain things that each denorriina<
than had added to our reli 'cus life,
adding that the sun was now setting
on the need for separate denomina-
tions, and that the church he hoped
would arise in this country, would
take over the best from each denomi»
nation, desearding its weaknesses.

“Two great problems yet remain-
ing to us," he continued, “are to ab—
sorb the intellectual conquests of
modern religion into the religion
of the common people through the
channels already mentioned and to
accomplish a moral conquest in the
many ﬁelds where people are as yet
untouched by the teachings of Jesus."

Religion Left to People

The speaker spent much of the
hour in tracing the history of the
background of our religion, especial-
ly in the Reformation period and
since. stressing in all cases that the
transformations in religion accom-
plished by the Reformation were not
mainly' of the intellectual variety.
He pointed out how the different in-
ﬂuences were brought to America,
where, after the American Revolu-
tioh, religion was entrusted to the
people for the ﬁrst time; hence our
peculiar contributions to religion as
outlined above.

Dr. Brooks emphasized the fact
that the religion of the Reformation
was not touched by scientific
thought; the scientist had to work in
the face of opposition from the
church. Even Martin Luther said,”
in regard to Copernicus theory, “a.
man is a fool who thinks that way."
And Calvin Said, “The Bible Says that
the foundations of the earth are ﬁx-
ed; that's enough for me.”

In regard to the Reformation's in-

Silz to Give Illustrated
Talk Here Wednesday

Dr. Walter Silz, Harvard Exchange
professor at Crinnell college, will
lecture on ”Romantic Towns of South
Germany" at Herrick chapel, Wed—

VARSITY TOMGHT.

There will be a Varsity dance this
evening in the women's gymnasium
immediately following the Washing—
tan-Grinnell basketball game. Polk
Burke and his Capitol Steamer band
from Davenport will furnish the
music.

After the Drak -Grlnnell basket-
ball game next Friday night, Verne
Winterowd and his Bluemelodians of

Reviewer Says
Plays Effective

Likes Especially Setting and
Lighting of ‘The

Crow's Nest’.

By Florence Lewis.

When the curtain rose for “The
Crow's Nest", the last of the three
one-act plays given by the Expert-
mental theater on Wednesday even-
ing, Feb. 12, the large audience
showed with applause its apprecia»
tion of the elaborate stage setting
and. ﬁne lighting effects. The set-
ting was cleveriy constructed to re—
present the Crow’s nest ,of an old
tramp steamer. Long rope ladders,
a narrow teetering platform, and
heavy wooden beams gave the effect
of the masts and rigging of the “Jes-
samine." To the skillful arrange-
ment of stage properties is due much
of the play's success, but to the .ac-
tors themselves goes the real cred ,

The action of this play by William
Manley centers around the ﬁgure of
the Creenhorn Kid played by Henry
Bray. The Kid’s frantic terror, as-
sumed bravado, and boyish zest for
adventure were well evident in Henry
Bray's excellent characterization.
Richard Phillips was a natural and
convincing JDJO, the able seaman
who in the Kid’s dream betrays the
ship to an enemy cruiser. Mr. Phil-
lips’ ability to speak brogue again
in this part of a
Scotch sailor. Russell Peterson em—
bodied fear and terror realistically
in his Mr, Peterson, the mate of the
"Jessamine."

Edenburn is Director

”The Crow's Nest" was directed
by Mrs. Sara Shemsn Pryor. The
setting for the play was under the
supervision of William Pryor.

The second comedy, “The Maker
of Dreams” by Cliphsnt Downs, was
directed by Evelyn Edenburn. Cora

Swimmers to Face
Creighton Tonight

Grinnell’s swimming team, twelve
strong, will invade the Creighton
stronghold tonight in an attempt to
gain a victory over the powerful
Creighton squad. The Pioneer team
will be composed of Dewey, who capv
tains the team, 00x, Miller, Thomas,
C. DeLcng, Laustrup, Brown, Con-
ard, Shamborg, Pitcher, Skoug, and
de Persia.

Despite the set—back the team re-
ceived at the hands of the Nebraska
aggregation last week coach Carroll
Swearengen expects his outfit to
make a good showing tonight. The
entire squad has been working out
daily during the past, week and in
several casesmen have been able to
cut down their time. If the Crin-
nell mermen succeed in taking the
Creighton team they Will have 8. good
start on the way to a place in the
Valley conference rankings.

Neither Creighton nor Grinneil has
shown any power in the pool this
season but the Pioneers seem to have
a slight edge in advance ratings
Dcwey can still rank as one of the
best dash men in the conference and
the fans will have to travel far to
find a diver much better than C. De-
Long. The Pioneers should take at
least one of the relay events, the
breast stroke, the back stroke and
the 440 yard free style.

 

shrubs under the cherry trees of
grade-school memory. A fountain,
with the water trickling over ferns
and rocks, will complete the trans
formation.

Guests at the ball will enter
through a lattice archway facing the
orchestra platform with its white
colonial pillars.
will show them where to place their
wraps and will direct the chaperones
to an alcove on the north side of the
garden. And then, with music and
dance ,the ball will begin.

Meanwhile, with the event but a
week in the future, all Grinnell co-
eds are digging down into their
trunks and bringing out oldrfcshiom
ed costumes for readjustments and
pressing. Thoe who have no full
skirts or velvet breeehes here at
school are writing frantic letters
home for mother “to please send
something to wear at the Colonial
Ball."

When next Saturday night rolls
around, the co-eds will have a party
all their own, only those who are
in costume will be allowed to dance,
and men may be onlookers only. They
will have to sit in the balcony and
watch'the gorgeous display of old-
fashioned pageantry below them, the
minuet danced by the W. A. A.
board, and the firefly dance, which
concludes the ball. Helen McLeran
is in charge of the ball committee,
Dorothy sells has charge of the light-
ing, Miriam McNally is in charge of
the program, and the remaining w.
A. A. board members are in charge
of the decorations. Preceding the
ball, all the Georges and Martbas will
dine in costume in the quadrangle
dining room

Marchh Tanager
Worthy -Critic

Finds Article by Baumann
High Point; Col-amends

: Card as Editor. .

By Helen Kingery.

The March issue of the Tanager,
the last number to be edited by Pro—
fessor Wayne Card of the journal-
ism department, is characteristically
instructive, edifying, and entertain-
ing. By its intrinsic nature, as a
college magazine seeking to give op-
portunity for student expression and
at the same time to obtain contribua
tions from established writers. it lays
itself open to a charge of un—evea.
ness. However justiﬁable,'and that
one must judge for himself,~it is
disconcerting to ﬁnd in the same
magazine pages reaching a literary
height amazing for so localized a
magazine, and others dropping so far
below that height, that one is apt to
doubt the existence of any critical
criteria,

This issue is ‘ no exception, al-
though one may safely say that
neither extreme has been realized.
The usual timely article, "Realities
in Europe” by Professor Frederick L.
Baumahn of the history department,
is representative of the Tanager on
its higher average. The article is a
clearlyrwl'ltten discussion of the con-
ditions underlying Briand's proposal
for a United States of Europeinot
only expositional, but constructively

That Crinnell college, and Pomona
college, at Claremont, California, are
much similar, was the impression
given by Dr. Raymond C. Brooks in
an interview Wednesday. _ Dr.
Brooks, who has been delivering the
Gates lectures at Grinnell this year,
_is professor of religion at Pomona.
"There are three colleges at Clare-
mont,” he said, "Pomona, the main
college, which has been established
for so years, is about the same size
as Grinnell. it is restricted to an
enrollment of 300 studentsqon
girls, and 400 boys. The second col-
lege, Scripps, which is in its third
year, has 150 girls. Next September
there will be 200, and from then on.
the size Will be restricted to that
number. Miss Ellen Scripps, who
is now 94, has contributed much to
this newer school. Claremont col-
lege is the graduate school. As at
Crinnell, it has not been thought
wise to have much graduate work at
Pomona, but maintain the highest
possible level of undergraduate work.
Perhaps the next college will be a
boys college, similar to Scripps."
The town of Claremont is smaller
than Crinnell, the population being

 

 

and Building Four and Cottage Five
and Smith hall

Brooks Finds Grinnell Like Pomona;
Has 140 in One Religious Class There

3600. Pomona has a 500 acre
campus, “with mountains right he
hind iii-1 great contrast to the
prairie land around Crinnell."

Religious courses, in which Dr.
Brooks instructs, are not required.
However, a great number of Stu»
dents enroll for them. Of the zoo
Freshmen at Pomona now, 140 are in
one of his classes.

As at Crinnell, chapel is voluntary.
”But, I am sorry to say. the chapel
attendance is not nearly as great as
the attendance at Crinnell. We have
an average of only 150," he remark-
ed before he learned that he was Sud<
ly disillusioned in supposing that the
attendance at the Gates lectures was
the "average Glinnell chapel atten-
dance." It was only four years ago
that chapel was made voluntary at
Pomona, and until seven years ago
Sunday morning, church attendance
was compulsory. Chapel there is
held three days a week.

“This year there is a million and
a half dollar building program going
on at Pomona", said Dr. Brooks. “A
$25,000 auditorium is being con—
structed, and new dormitories are to
be erected.”

The Washington—Bears, still form—
idable in defeat, will invade Grinnell

in an effort to regain conference
laurels dropped in the past week. De-
feats by Drake and Creighton have
pulled the St. Louis outfit out of the
top berth in the Missouri Valley con-
ference. The hiuejays practically
clinched the title last night when.
led by Big Brad Jensen, and Van
Ackeran, they romped over the
down-river hopefuls with a count of
so to 23.

The game with Washington to.
night is one of three conference
games left for Grinnell and will give
them a chance to win better than
half of their Valley contests. Grin»
nail is now in fourth place with a
record of two victories and three
losses. A victory tonight will mean
an even average for Crlnnell and if
they' can continue the season with
victories over Drake and the Okla-
homa Aggies it will mean a possible
tie for second place at the close of
the Schedule.

Meyer rs Dangerous

Almough Drake and Creighton
have trounced Washington, giving
rise -to the popular belief that Grin-
nell should follow via the same path,
the coaches recall that Washington,
_with Moose Meyer at center, is al-
ways likely to hit the hoop. Grinnell’s
disastrous experience at St. Louis
earlier in the year is indicative of
the latent possibilities in the Wash-
ington aggregation.
The Pioneers have spent the last
Week at light workouts, polishing
their plays but not driving hard to
get in shape. Most of the men have
benefited by this, the injuries of
Douglas and Humphrey showing im-
provement, These men Will Still be
handicapped by game legs, however.
DeLong has been hitting the basket
with regularity little short of Sensa-
tional while McCreary has fallen off
in his usual brand of play. The lit-
tle guard may not start tonight, but
he will undoubtedly Seet action in
part of the game.

The Washington- lineup boasts a

Meyer, Duncan and Wientge While
only three Crinnell lettennen are
scheduled to take the floor when the
game opens. The Pioneers stand a
good chance to get the tip since
Humphrey is about the same height
as Meyer, Bear pivot man. The
Washington center led the conference
in scoring last year, however, and
must be watched,
