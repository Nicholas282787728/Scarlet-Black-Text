On Other Hills

The new Brewer field house at
Missouri university was dedicated
last night followed by the Missouri-
Kansas basketball game. The Tige
er won 29-13. The new field house
has been built at a cost of $275,000
and is the largest in the state, being
similar to those of Iowa and Indiana.
The new gymnasiurrr is large
enough to aocomodate baseball and
football practice. Scrimmage is
easily facilitated due to the earthen
floor. Were it not for the high raft—
ters interfering with high prrnts, in-
door football could he played.

Walking a distance of six miles
each' morning and evening for four
years withorrt once accepting a ride,
a Creighton university law student
has never been late to an 8 o’clock
class.

. Buddy Fisher and his Orchestra
have been engaged to play for the
annual Junior prom at Marquette
university which will be held Febrile
cry 25. Admission will be $5.00 per
couple. The wearing of corsages
has been made taboo by a student
ruling.

A recent chapel service held at
Cornell college honored the football
team for its splendid work during the
year. Speeches were made by the
coaches and members of the team.

The Eederal Radio commission
has recently permitted WEBW, Bel-
oit college radio station, to broadcast
programs every day. Heretofore the
station had been on the air only dur-
ing college vespers and special
events. Dinner programs are now
being broadcast each evening,

A Colonial bail, very similar to
the one being held tonight at Crin-
nell, was held last Monday night at
Coe college. Following a dinner at
e p. m. in the Women's quadrangle,
the participants went to the gym-
nasium which was decorated in red,
white and blue for the remainder of
the‘ evening. ‘

Social Program

Stevenson Announces House
Party Dales for Both

Men and Women.

Dates for house parties were an~
nounced today by Robert Stevenson,
head of the Rec committee, along
the social program for the remaindr
er of the year. They will begin on
April 19, when three of the women’s
cottages will have their par-ties. On
May 3, the other three women's COL—
tages will have their spring parties.
It has not yet been deﬁnitely decided
as to what cottages will he assigned
to each of these dates. On May 17,
Langan, Four and Clark will have
their parties, while May 24 is the
date assigned to Dibble, Smith and
Three.

Five Special Dances.

Five big special dances are on the
program: Honor “G" ball on March
15, the Spring formal on March 28,
the Junior prom on April 12, the
Brown Derby Drag on May 10, and
the Senior prom on June 7. While
the Brown Derby Drag was
nounced originally for May 3, the
date has been changed because it
was felt that a track meet on that
date would likely decrease the at»
tendance at the dance. This event is
sponsored by Grinnell chapter of
Sigma Delta Chi, and during the
evening several ”razz" awards of
long standing 'are made, headed by
the award of the Brown Derby to
the senior who has gotten by with
the biggest in school with the least
amount of work. Arrangements are
being made .to secure a famous re-
cording band for the Drag.

“The students herc have an ap»
preciativc, refresbrng spirit," said
Dr. Walter Silz, Harvard Exchange
lecturer in German romanticism,
when asked his impressions of Grins
nell.

“There is a friendly atmosphere,
and no aloofness or apparent segre-
gation of groups. I like the natural
spirit of the students and the facul-
ty.. I wish that I could stay a whole
semester instead of having to movc
on so quickly. It is difficult to be-
come well acquainted with the stur
dents in giving such a condensed
003158.”

Mrs. Silz’ impression of Crinnell is
that "Grluuell is the most friendly
place we ever struck. Our- first inr-
pression was of the beautifully laid
out town, with its elm trees. There
are more elm trees in Crinnell than
in Cambridge. Your principal recitr
ation hall is better and much newer
than ours."

Both Dr. and Mrs, Silz commented
on the natural relation existing
among members of the faculty, and
the spirit of unity existing between
the faculty and townspeople of Grin-
oell. "There is no intellectual snob-
bel'y,” they said. The small, intim-
ate groups possiblc in a college the
Size of Crinnell are not possible in a
large university, Dr. Silz pointed out.

has a large teaching staff, one does

rnot meet socially all the members
even of one's own department.

With regard to the new dormitory
,system which is being cstablrshed at
rHal'vzu'd college. Dr. Silz explained
lthdt President Lowell's purpose is to
break the large college into smaller
'unita. “It is an attempt to regain
the virtues and advantages of the
small college, a uniquely American
,institution. Harvard is trying to re-
‘cover for itself things which Grin-
neli hits and probably takes for
granted~the intimate, informal life
of a small college community. There
is not the same spirit of unity in a
large university.

“For the present the change is in
the living system only, not a change
in instruction. It is a social change.
There will be from two hundred and
ﬁfty to .three hundred men in each
house. Two of the houses will be in
operation next fall. Four more are
under way."

Emphasis is being placed on in—
tramural athletics at Harvard with
the development of the new donni-
tory hotrsing. Each dormitory will
have its own squash and tennis
corrrts, and a new gymnasium is be-
ing built near by. By making in-
tramural sports popular President
Lowell hopes to make intercollegiate
athletics unnecessary. His ideal is

Frosh are Beaten ,
by Seniors, 31-8

In a one»sided, but hard—fought
basketball game, the senior girls
downed the freshmen girls by a
score of 31 to 8 in Rand gymnasirrm
Thursday afternoon. The game was
the first of the annual inter-class
series.

Outstanding features of the game
were the smooth-working offense of
the seniors, their air-tight defense.
and the ﬁghting spirit shown by the
ﬁrst year women, whose guards did
good work. Carlson was high scor-
. er for the seniors; Heynen and Jen-
sen were outstanding for the fresh.
men. g

Composing the senior team were
Fern Teget, Captain Marjorie Wild—
er, Helen Carlson, Mary Bates,
Loretta Mutersbaugh, and Mary
Doris Carpenter, with Aileen Cohen
as substitute. On the freshmen
squad were Captain Jane Heynen,
Barbara Bates, Margaret Sherman,
