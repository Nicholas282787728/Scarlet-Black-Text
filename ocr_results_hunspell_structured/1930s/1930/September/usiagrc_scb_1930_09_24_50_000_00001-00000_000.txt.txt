While it was generally conceded
that Dibble hell had won the Pottle
trophy for the second consecu-
tive year. it was not until this after-
noon that offrcial figures were given
out by the department -of athletics.

The report shows that Dibble earn-
ed a total of 1165.1 points against the
1035.3 of Langan. who took second
place. Clark, Gates. Smith, and Three
followed in order. The trophy is given
for allraround dormitory superiority.

Nine sports and scholarship were
ﬁgured in the ﬁnal standings. The
athletic program included speedball,]
cross-country. basketball, indoor
baseball, water polo, swimming,
track, tennis, and baseball.

Duke Voices Approval

Water polo, played for the first
time last year, was won by Smith
hall. Dibble took first places in speed-
-ball, outdoor baseball, tennis, and
cross country. L'angan's wins came
in basketball, track, and a tie with
Building Three for the indoor base-
ball championship.

Coach G. Lester Duke, the repre<
sentative of the college athletic dee
partment in charge of intramural
sports, voiced his approval of the re-
sult of the 1929-1930 season. ”It was
a’success.” he said, "because the fin-
al standings were»close, and that is
what we want."

Intramural Board Planned

Coach Duke announced that a new
plan, which should prove a help to
the intramural system, will be inaug-
urated. Each building will appoint
one man to act as the intermediary
between his building and the athletic
department. The six men and the
junior manager will form a group to
he known as the intramural athletic
board.

This body, while having no actual
power, will approve schedules, post-
ponements, and such matters of sim-
ilar nature. It is hoped that this
change will bring about a better
spirit of cooperation between the var-
ious dormitories on the campus.

ing at 7:15. All former members are

Quality, not quantity, seems to be
the makeup of the freshman football
squad. Twentyeseven men reported
for the first practice yesterday of-
ternoon, when Coach John Truesdale
ran them through a light workout.
The program consisted of limbering
up exercises and a little work in
handling the ball.

Freshman teams, as a rule, don't
look so good on the gridiron for the
ﬁrst few weeks, but the little Pion-
eers showed some real class yester-
day. Short practices will continue
throughout the week.

lGrinnell Lacks

Scoring Power
Against Dutch

Leg Injury Keeps Douglas
Out as Team Drills
for Wesleyan

Lack of scoring seemed to be the
chief weakness of the Grinnell cola
lege gridruen in their ﬁrst practice
under the new War-d field lights last
night, Matching strides with the Cen-
tral college eleven of Pella, the Pion-
eers managed to run wild in midfield,
but found trouble putting the oval
across the line.

The Pioneers started the scrima
mnge on the defensive with Bilto and
Minier st ends; Humphrey and Wal-
ker at tackles; Murray and Brad—
ford at guards; Christoffersen at
center; Thomas at quarter; Hensley
and Ruff at halves, and U'ﬂrich at
fullback. The Dutchmen could not
gain and kicked, Grinnell taking the
offensive with 70 yards in nine plays.
A quartet of tries at the locyard rib—
bon failed to push over a counter,
however,

Douglas Stays on Bench

Len Winter's men again failed to
gain and once on the offensive, the
Pioneers romped to the 20—yard line,
only to be stopped on nearly a score
of successive attempts. The gridmen
from Della also found going rough in
their attempt to gain, making about
30 yards in twenty tries.

Coach Lester Watt was careful not
to allow any of his regulars to suf—
fer from injuries, keeping Capt. Ben
Douglas on the bench altogether and
yanking Christoffersen when he
twisted a leg. “Shep” Taylor, reserve
tackle is a regular incumbent of the
bench now with a game ankle.

Passes Fail

The failure of the line driving last
night was equalled by the lack of
completed passes. Even Ruff’s tosses
seldom found a receiver. and he was
constantly rpshed by opposing line-
men. These were offset, however, by
the brilliant work of Inlrich and
Thomas on off tackle plays, and the
success of lateral passes which were
seen occasionally.

pioneer line prospects brightened
considerably in the last week with
Murray showing a great game at
guard and Freddie Norton, diminu-
tive veteran of several games in the
1928 season. reporting. Ruff, Doug—
las, and Thomas came back from
their four—day vacation from scrim-
mages, however, without the form
they had been showing previously.

Only Four Men Lost

The Grinnell eleven will not be
tackling any setup Whén it meets
Iowa Wesleyan under the lights here
Saturday. The Tigers lost only four
men by graduation. They were Scan—
ton. center; Tackleson, tackle; Hil—
ton. half, and Zilmer, end. Turner,
another veteran end, is not playing
this season because of a knee injury
which has failed to heal.

Uffelman is back at half, however,
and is expected to be a big star. He
was captain last year and this will
be his fourth season as teammate
to Benson, a burly guard who is
leading the aggregation this year.
other letter men expected to star are
Bradshaw and Parks, halfbacks:
Sandbcrg, Barton, and Clark, tack-
les; Dresser and Phelps, ends; Ram—
bo, center, and Hingst. and Davidson,
guards.

The Saturday contest is scheduled
to start at 3 pm.

Al Sharpe, Washington
Coach, Approves Night
Football for Ward Field

Washington university's football
coach. Al Sharpe, stated his approv-
al of the installation of lights for
night football at Grinnell in 8. com-
munication received by The Scarlet
and Black today. Sharpe completes
the roster of Missouri Valley con—
ference Coaches who have Sent. con-
gratulations to Grinnell upon its a-
doption of night football.

Coach Sharpe Writes: ”Night foot—
ball. I believe, has come to stay in
this section of the country during
the ﬁrst half of the football season
for two reasons. First, it is easier
on the players. Second, more people
can attend.

”Now that Grinnell has added the
night games to its schedule, it is to
be congratulated and will, I am sure.
reap the same benefits that the other
members of tho Missouri Valley con-
fercnco have received.”

Dr. E. A. Steiner left yesterday for
Pittsburgh, Pa, where he will Speak
at at Sunday school convention.
