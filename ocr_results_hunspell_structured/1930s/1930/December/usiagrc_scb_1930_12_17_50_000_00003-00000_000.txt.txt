turned back Iowa, 26 to 14. satur-
day night they played their best
game, although they lost to thc Kan-

before it dropped iinto the basket in
the last 15 sewnds of play, togeuier

the Billikens because the crowd boo-
ed the referee’s decision, resulted in
their downfall.

Nigro of the Aggies sank the free
throw on the technical foul after
missing the foul shot. in a tipoff
under the basket, Cronkite, 6 foot 5
inch center of the Aggies, tipped the
ball into the basket to put his team-
mates in the lead. The close guards

to score a field goal in the first half
of the game, the Billikens leading, s
