A SUCCESSFUL Y,M,C,A,

Ally organization is as strong and effective as
tllc men who plan and carry on its programs. The
Young Men’s Christian association Thursday night
at its first meeting of the your gavc promise of an
intelligent, vigorous, and progressive year on the,
campus

During the meeting the program for the year
to collie was outlined by the vice president The
plan included fin alternation of meetings of the
discussion group type with dinner-type meetings,
to which all college men are to be invited and at
which various well known speakers will give their
views on questions of current interest. Men suge
gestcd for these speaking addresses include Kirby
Page, world traveler and author; Paul Blanchard,
former editor of the New Republic, and Harry A.
Bone. lecturer (Ill men’s and women’s relations.

If the local Y.l\I.C.A, organization can get
these men on Grinnell’s campus to talk to the
student body or any port of it, they will have in
that: ollc achievement zllonc done a large service
to the college.

At the meeting Thursday slips of paper were
passed to the 87 men attending asking, among
other things, for the men to write two or three
topics on any subject whatever that they would
like to hear discussed. This action on the port of
the “Y,” ill having the men themselves choose the
topics for discussion in the rest of the meetings of
the year, seems to indicate a realization of the fact
that only organizations which ﬁll it deﬁnite need
in the lives of those among whom they work at-
tract large followings.

The YMCA. this year seems blessed with vig-
orous leadership and an unusual undcrtanding of
the campus situation With these factors in its
favor, it seems almost certain to have a tremene
dously successful year. G ,

WOMAN’S EDUCATION TODAY
(Fl-om ﬂia Daily Iowan)

Woman’s education today should include a
knowledge of laws that govern the physical and
mental sides of children, in the belief of Ruth
Bryan Owen.

Four walls no longer house the family of the
American woman. The influence of the family is
present now whcrcvcl- its interests are involved.
The political woman of today i. spreading the wing
of motherhood over thousands of childrcll instead
of losing motherhood

\Voman gradually is entering the prof onol
ﬁeld, where It college degree is necessary. Generally
she gets a degree and teaches, or returns home
and waits for morrige, or both, Mrs. Owen is right
in that children of a mother who has a college degree
will receive better care physically and mentally
than those of a woman who has not earned a
diploma.

Answers received by on inquiring reporter of
a middlcwcst metropolitan daily newspaper to the
question of educating either the marl or the woman
are 80 per cent in favor of the former.

The replies to the question unanimously agree
that it is more important -to educate the man be-
cdusc he makes tllc living. Pcrhdps professional
and business women are appearing, but in the mind
of the layman the duty of the woman is still in the
home. The inquiring rcportcr further discovered
that the answers of working women favored the
man receiving tllc education, because after mar-
riagc the woman could stay within the four walls
and rest from the effects of her daily labor ill
business.

A family in which tllc mother, not only the
father, has a college dcgrcc is becoming more im-
portant in modern society. Under the guidance of
it mother, who is a college graduate, the home
should furnish o higher environment for children
to grow into good citizens and he imbued with the
ideals of government.

DOES COLLEGE GUARANTEE A JOB?
(From the Bel it Round Table)

In a recent article in e Grinnell Good News, Pres.
.1. H. T. Main of Grinnell college sets forth the following
admonishrnent to the college student:

“No, the college doesn't guarantee a job. It does
inﬁnitely more, It does things that cannot be measured
in terms of money. It opens the way to many jobs never
imagined by the one out of college.

“The college does guarantee to help you get ready
for a job. It guarantees to help you make the right
choice among many possible jobs. A wrong choice is ofr
tan a tragic mistake. College guarantees to give an
initial advantage that will carry you far, if only you

determine to go far.
"Opportunity will not push you into success. Rather

you must take a slim chance and make of it a great
success. That is where you show, with the help of your
college, your native power.”

NIGHT FOOTBALL FOR WESLEYAN
(From the Iowa \‘Vesleylu'l News)

since the use of floodlights has almost completely
changed the age old practice ,of holding football games
in the afternoon, it seems expedient that those most
vitally concerned, namely, the players, should have an
opportunity to accustom themselves to the practice of
playing in the light of miniature suns.

To perfect so efﬁcient blocking, tackling, touch»
down scoring machine, it is necessary to practice long
and tediously. Since no agent yet invented has been
effective in keeping the sun shining on Iowa Wesleyan‘s
practice ﬁelds until 7 during October and November. it
would seem necessary to surplant the sun with a substi—
tute. ‘

Only the small, more backward schools are still in
the dark and since Wesleyan is not backward, just small,
the l-loodlights should be installed as soon as possible.

ONE POEM ABOUT WOMEN
(From the Columbia Missourian)

It doesn‘t pay to belittle women. Sir William Wat-
son, an Englishman, was forced from fame to compara-
tive obscurity, hecanse of his poem, entitled, “The
Woman with the Serpeut’s Tongue.” Watson was at
one time one of the greatest of England's poets. Now,
at his seventy-second birthday, he is poor and little
known, His chief income is a pension of $1,009 a year
that the government has granted to him,

Sir William was born in 1858, the son of a well-to-
do Yorkshire business man. He published his ﬁrst poems
in Liverpool papers, and his book of verse, “Wordsworth
Grave," received commendation. His fame increasedrap»
idly, and in 1892 when Lord Tennyson died, the Illus-
trated London News asked him to write a commemora-
tive poem. Watson locked himself up for 50 hours with»
out food, drink, or tobacco and wrote “Lacrimae Mu-
sarurn." The poem was hailed by critics as ﬁner than
the one Tennyson had written on the death of Duke of
Wellington.

Gladstone seriously considered making Sir William
poet laureate, and his fame continued until he published
"The Woman Wittl the Serpents Tongue." The poem
began as follows:

“She is not old, she is not young,

“The woman with the serpents tongue,

“The haggard cheek, the hungering eye,

“The poison words that wildly ﬂy,

“The famished face, the fevered hand,

“Who slights the worthiest in the land,

"Sheers at the just, condemns the brave,

“And blackens goodness in its grave."

The poem followed this vein throughout. Society in
London agreed that it definitely pictured an English
woman high in social and political life. Watson tried
to explain that the poem was not about anyone in par—
ticular, but London was otherwise convinced and Sir
William was completely ostracized.

Though Sir William was knighted in 1917, the stir
his poem had created prevented his being named poet
laureate. It is hard to undrstand why society should
snatch from its niches of honor a distinguished poet
because of one poem, but fame and fancy change swiftr
1y. Faults and errors, slight intrinslcully, otten have
lasting effects.
