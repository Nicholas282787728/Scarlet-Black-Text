By TED CARPENTER
(Special ‘to The Scarlet and Black)

MILWAUKEEaif there is one
game on the 1930 Marquette univer-
sity football schedule that the Golden
Avalanche is supremely anxious to
win, it is Friday night's engagement
with the Grinnell college Pioneers
here, and Coach Frank J. Murray is
drilling his lads overtime as he pre-
pares for the ﬁrst "starlight" en-
gagement of the season.

Grinnell has been a jinx for the
best of Marquette teams. Two years
ago, playing at Grinnell,the Avalan-
che went into the fourth quarter
with a 13 to 0 lead, only to have
Coach “Fuzz" Watt's battlers come
back with a barriagc of successful
forward passes which carried them
to a 20 to 13 victory. 1n Milwaukee
last season, the Pioneers won in the
last two minutes of play on a sen-
sational 40 yard placekick,

Beat Lawrence Saturday

Coach Murray has developed a
handsome looking team at Marquette
this fall, but local fans refuse to ap-
praise it until they see how it fares
against the Grinnell jinx.

Using straight football almost all
the way, the Hilltoppers smothered
Lawrence, 27 to 0, Saturday in a

game that brought to light the versaei

tility and strength of a halfvdozen
backs, and the great defensive power
of the line.

Following the Lawrence game,
Marquette fans were talking of the
ﬁne performance of Eugene "Tuffy"
Ronzanl, sophomore fullback, whose
185 pounds of beef and brawn car-
ried him 79 yards in 15 attempts.
Don Elliot, a 195 pound sophomore
halfback, also showed great possibili-
ties.

Fessler Finds High School Freshmen
Active as Chinese Political Leaders

“China has a very distinct appeal
for me, and I hope some day to re-
turn," said Donald Fessler, who re—
turned this fall from chhow, Shan—
tung, China, where he taught Eng—
lish in the Porter—Wyckoff Middle
school, “Grinnell—in-China:v Fessler
left Grinnell at the and of his junior
year in 1928. He will graduate with
the 1931 class next dune.

“For a foreigner, life in China of—
fers much: international contacts, a
deeper and more wholesome atmos-
phere than in America, a most Cora
dial and hospitable community life,
and unique opportunities for travel."

Youth in Politics

When asked what impressed him
the most in that country, he answer-
ed, “1 have been greatly impressed
by the remarkably active part the
students, who are often only high
school freshmen, take in Chinese poll-
tics. Boys and girls of 16 to 20 often
become leaders of the party groups,
and the havoc which their undevelop-
ed minds create is immense.

“Many of these are communists,
who have been expelled from the
Christian or- other schools. Of
course, they have a thirst for vcngc-
ance, and it is almost entirely due to
them that China is progressing so

 

slowly along educational lines."
China War Spasmodic

“The civil war in China is a spas-
modic affair which usually gets a
start in the spring of each year,
comes to a climax in the summer, and
in the fall dies out until the cam-
paign begins again the next spring.

"During my stay in China, Techow
was occupied in turn by both the
nationalist troops and. the northern
rebel forces under Generals Yen Hsi
Shan and Feng Yu Shang. Though
troops of both sides were often little
more than bandits, we were only mo-
lested once and then in a harmless
manner.”

Much Poverty

“The poverty of the Chinese, the
hardships, and the unsanitary condi—
tions, which were everywhere preval-
ent, were far worse than I could ever
have been led to believe without sees
ing them with my own eyes,” said
Fessler. "Though drought and grass—
hopper plagues and the civil war
caused famine and suffering all
around us, I did not at any time wit
ness the dreadful sights due to Starr
vation which could be seen in the
more inland provinces."

On his way home Fessler traveled
through Russia, Siberia, Poland, Ger-
many, Switzerland, Italy, and France.

Hockey Leads
7 in Fall Sport

iColtage Athletics Replace
Interclass Schedule

for Women

1 Cottage competi ion rather than
interclass competition is featuring
‘this year's program of the Women's
Athletic association.

Previously each woman went into
sports to get enough points for num-
erals or a letter. This year everyone
is being encouraged to choose her
favorite sport and try for the cot-
tage team. Hockey. primarily a fall
sport, is being stressed at present,
and a silver cup is to be awarded to
the cottage winning the tournament,

Before the tournaments can he
started, however, each woman must
have ﬁve one hour practices, super-
vised by her cottage captain, or
‘sport leader.

Much Educational Value

The whole idea of the new plan. as
explained by Miss Clara J. Andersen,
director of physical education for
women, is for the educational value.
Physical education is coming more
and more to the front as a major in-
terest, One should not only receive
enjoyment from the playing of an
exciting set of tennis, but should be
able to analyze the whys and where—
fares,

Crosby Pinns Hockey

The theoretical side of each game
will be stressed. especially in the
carry-over sports, those which do not
need a team but may require only
lone opponent, or may be practiced
alone, as archery.

Miss Leone Crosby. instructor in the
physical education department, is
making plans for hockey this fall.
There are several veteran players and
the freshman women are turning out
”en masse." There are several cx-
perienced players among those.
