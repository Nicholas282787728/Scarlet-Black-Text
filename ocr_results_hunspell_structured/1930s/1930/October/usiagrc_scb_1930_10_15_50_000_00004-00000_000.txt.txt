§olem Orders Drill
for Pass Checking

(Continued From Page 1)

Drake a victory. Calisthentics, sigc
rial drill, and passing practice occuc
pied most of the time. The varsity
also tried its hand at diagnosing
GrinnelHormations as executed by
the freshmen.

One ray of light is seen as a result
of the last game. it is the discovery
of a new backfield star in the form
of Lloyd Lansrud, rated one of the
nation's leading pole vaulters.

Lansrud. a former Des Moines prep
school luminary, reported for foot-
hall for the first time at Drake in
this, his junior year. Against Man--
quette he gained 91 yards, more than
any other memher of Drake's highly-
touted backfield. Lansrud will prob—
ably see action against Grinnell.

C ouch Watt’s Plan
of Attack Secret

The Missouri Valley conference
championship 7 that is practically
what Drake and Grinnell will be batt-
ling for Friday evening when the two
teams clash in the Drake stadium 'z-ls
the headliner in Drake's Homecoming
program.

Not only that, but the intense l‘ir
valry that has always prevailed he-

I
tween these two teams will tend to

make the contest all the more of a
battle. The two schools have met 36
times on the gridiron, and Drdke has
snared 20 of these with two games
as ties.

Drake Has Weight

Drake has the advantage of a
heavier and perhaps mightier team,
but the Pioneers are counting on their
fleet hacks to tote the pigskin while
a game and fighting line, one of the
lightest on record, provides the interc
fei-ence.

Grinnell has played three games so
far this season and, with the excep-
tion of the Iowa Wesleyan game, has
had little opportunity to exhibit its
offense. However, it is hoped that
playing against Drake this Friday
the Pioneer attack will once again
swing into scoring momentum.
Two Tie Games

In the 36 games the tie contests
were in 1920 and 1929, when the
scores were 7—7 and 6A6, respectively.
The Pioneers have suffered shutout
defeats at the hands of the Bulldogs
13 times, and have in turn held Drake
scoreless 11 times. In the entire
string of contests Drake has amassed
a total of 487 points, while Grinnell
boasts only 395.

The Missouri Valley football title
was more a mythical than an actual
crown last year. On paper Drake and
Grinnell tied for honors, but the Bull-
dog record was more impressive.

 

Grinnell Prepared

Monday afternoon Coach ”Fuzz"
Watt sent his squad through a light
workout in the rain. A chalk talk
followed. Yesterday the Pioneer inch-
tor clamped down on his gridmen and
a long signal drill greeted the varsity.

The regulars were kept out of
scrimmage yesterday, but the second
string men were kept busy with the
fast improving freshman outfit. The
work this week has showed that
Grinncll is ready.

For the first time this season Coach
Watt seems undecided on his starting
lineup. Granund, who has been work-
ing as an understudy for Capt. Ben
Douglas. saw considerable action in
the Detroit game and seems to be
making rapid improvement. In the
practice Tuesday afternoon Gi-aniind
was included in the varsity lineup.

Douglas Predicts Victory

Again the Grinnell mentor is keep
ing secret the plan of attack with
which he will meet Drake. Unless
some change is made in the next few
days, the Drake Bulldogs will ﬁnd
themselves confronted with a fast
running- attack, which may be varied
with an occasional series of passes.

Coach Watt is confident that Grin-
nell will stop Drake’s highly touted
little four horsemen," while Captain
Douglas voiced the opinion: “The
team so far just hasn't showed what
they've got in them, hut We'll beat
Drake this Friday, 6 to 0, maybe!"
