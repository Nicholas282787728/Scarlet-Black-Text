contest.

Jerry Davis, who alternates at
quarterback with Eddie Jelen, de-
veloped an arm infection. and his
chances are slim to play against the
Pioneers. Minor injuries are ham-
pering the work of Jack Furay, stal-
wart center, and Co—Captein Rudy
Tesar, star tackle.

Harri Scrimmage Tuesday

Last night the only hard scrim-
mage scheduled for the week saw the
freshman squad pitted against the
varsity in aversatile display of aerial
attack and counter-attack. The year-
angs. employing crinnell plays, met
with considerable success against the
varsity defense, and Coach Stark’s
regulars likewise counted with their
own plays.

Stark’s starting lineup is still a
mystery to Jay followers, especially
in the backfield. It is almost cer—
tain that Wee Willie Worthing will
get the call at left halfback, where
his triplerlhreht ability constitutes
the most potent factor in the Jay
offense. At fullback Red McConr
ville and Ollie Scott a're dividing hon-
ors.

Halfback Post Undecided

Most undecided of all is the right
halfback post. where Allison. Clancy.
and Crawford have been staging a
battle royal. Clancy is conceded to
be the best pass receiver. but Allison
and Crawford are capable blockers
and ballrcaniers. Crawford is also
a punter of considerable ability.

Jelen will in all probability run
the team from the quarterback posi»
tion, especially since his 60-yard re-
turn of a punt against Haskell for a
touchdown last Saturday. which
marked him as a dangerous man in
the open field. He is a deadly tack-
ler and a heady signal-cauer.

Indications on the Omaha campus
point to a slzeable delegation of
Creighton students who will attend
the Grinnell game.

Dauglas, Ullrich
Nurse Injuries

Odds which favored Grinnell have
slowly shifted. and now reports indi-
cate that the Creighton football
team will go into the game with on
even rating when the two teams clash
on Ward field Friday night. The
gri iron contest will he the feature of
Griuuell's Homecoming program.

One of our good helpers
was greatly embarrassed
the other day when a lady,
approached him saying
“Mister may I see your
underwear?”

The clerk was so embar-
rassed that he fell off the

ed to buy some Arrow

Speaking of underwear
what else do you need from
Preston‘s for homecoming?
Chances are there will be a
pant or two during lheweek
end activities, which brings
to mind our two pant suits
that are more or less our
pride and joy.

ing no chances of being left with a
crippled squad for the game. and he
has ordered only light workouts for
the remainder of the week. As it is
the Pioneer outfit will not be at its
best physically.

James. fleet halfback, is out with
a bad ankle; Golz, end. is on the
bench with a crippled arm, while
Capt. Ben Douglas, Bowlby, and
Ullrich are suffering with slight in-
juries.

Creighton Equal ln Strength

The game Friday night will in all
probability be one of surprises. Both
teams have had an unusual season
and if a break comes this week, the
outcome of the game will be in doubt
until the final whistle.

The Pioneers have met some tough
teams during their four consecutive
“away" games, and have experienced
some battering at the hands of the
heavier ,teams. Friday. however,
when they meet a team of their own
strength, on.their own territory. be-
fore a Homecoming crowd, they may
display a better brand of football
than they have so far this year.

Hensley at End

The Grinch mentor is shaping his
team so that it will be ready to meet
Creighton with either a passing at-
tack or a running offense. If the
Wattmen use the latter. it will mean
that “Hank" Thomas will be called on
for his ends runs which have, in the
past, been so sensational. In yester-
day’s scrimmage against the year-
lings and the scrubs. Thomas slipped
off the ends for long gains. showing
that the stuff is still there

Ben Hensley,.who has been work-
ing in the backfield all season. will
see action at right end, according
to Watt who seemed satisfied with
Hensley’s performance at thatllposi-
tion in the Carleton game, With Ull-
rich starting in the backfield at half»
back, there will be no other changes
in the lineup.

One “"ln Out of Five

Grinnell has met Creighton five
times. Out of these five games the
Pioneers have won only once. that
being last year when the scarlet and
black representatives took an easy
12-0 win on Thanksgiving day in
Omaha.

In 1898 Creighton won s7 and in
