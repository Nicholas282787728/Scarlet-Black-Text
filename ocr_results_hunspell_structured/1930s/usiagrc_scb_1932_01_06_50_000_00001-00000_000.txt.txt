ship in the conference to six colleges.

Following the withdrawal from the
conference of lowa State college and
other Big Six schools a number of
years ago, Drake university and Grins
nell college were the nucleus for a
new league. Since then Creighton

university, Washington university, St.

Louis university, and Oklahoma A.
and M, have been added, taking in
more territory than was included In
the orign'nal Missouri Valley confers
ence.
Compete in ‘38:;

Although most of the football

schedules for 1932 are complete it

may be that Butler will meet one or

two of the Valley schools on the grid»
iron this fall. Butler will not meet
Grinnell in football until 1933 as the
Pioneer schedule for the fall is pracs
tically complete. Basketball compee
tition with Valley schools will also
be postponed until next year.

while no arrangements have been
made, it is possible that the Butler
track team will meet some of the col-
leges in the conference this spring.
Butler, which like Drake, has the
nickname of Bulldogs, is strong in
the three major sports, football, barre
ketball, and track, being awarded the
national cage championship by the
Veteran’s Athletic association of
America in 1929.

Tests in Laboratory Prove Grinnell
Water Supply Uncontaminated Now

Probe of

Statement Correct;

System Shows

Rumors Persist

Following a story in The Scarlet
and Black Dec. 16 which quoted Hen-
ry S. Canard, professor of botany
here, and chairman of the faculty
committee on public health, as saying
that rumors that the city water sup—
ply was contaminated were false, SeV-l
eral Grinnell residents claimed ,to
have proof that there was present
contamination in the city water sup-
ply. During Christmas vacation, col<
lcgc officials had a Sample of Grills
hell water sent to the laboratories at
the State University of Iowa, and it
was reported free from all harmful

vbacteria.

Part of the claims that the Grinnell
drinking water supply was contam-
inated were based on the fact that

 

the state department of health had
not completely approved the local
system, The reason given by the state
department was that main pipes come
ing from Arbor lake feeding the her —
ers about town and the mains carry-
ing drinking water were connected at
several places in order that boilers
might have uninterrupted service in
case the soft water supply gave out.

The other reason for not approving
the Grinneil water supply was be-
cause of the open reservoir. All Con~
nections between the soft water and
the drinking supply has now been re-
moved, and the state department has
recommended the covering of tho lo-
cal reservoir, which derives the water
from a deep well.

The sample of water which was
taken from the quadrangle kitchen
was declared by the lawn City labs
oratories to be free from any bacter-
ium coli, and satisfactory in all other
respects. This was one of several
tests which are taken from various

sources on campus each year.

Faculty to Vote
,on Audit Plan

Decision in Matter

The central auditing plan for cams
pus organizations, approved by the
student council and a faculty com—
mittee appointed to investigate the
proposal, will be presented to the
lfaculty for a vote Monday afternoon.

If the faculty approves the plan it
will go to the trustees for a final de»
cision regarding its merits.

If the plan is approved. a director
of student accounts will be appointed,
,prcbably some one connected with
the treasurer‘s office who will have
charge of the entire system and who
will audit each organization's hooks
once each semester, probably near the
close.

Each organization will be required
to use standard account books which
will be furnished through the college
book store and keep the books in the
some form. Also each group must
hank all its money and pay all bills
by check. A simple accounting meth~
ad will he used, so the proposed sys-
tem will not materially effect organ»
izallons which at present are using
adequate systems, but will serve to
put all organization bookkceping on
a uniform basis.

Joseph W. Charlton, professor of
econmics, is chairman of the general
committee which has been organi .
mg the proposed cemlal auditing sys-
tem, and Lee Alexander is head of
the' student committee.

Bosshnm Counts

Grinnell held Tulsa scoreless for
the first five minutes of the game
whilc Duncan and Rowe led the way
to the lead, but late in the period. lo-
cal sharpshooters found the netting
to pile up nine points before the rest
session.

The home aggregation took a defin-
ite lead at the start of the second
half but Duncan's oue~hand shots
sent the tilt into a tie as the game
neared the final gun. Bassham, Tul-
sa forward, caught the back court
napping in the final minutes for two
goals that decided the game and
made him high scorer with 14 points.

Duncan led the Pioneer outfit with
12 points. Ullrich scored six, Rowe
three, and Waite two.

Pioneers Down
Aggies, 25-22

(Soafal la The Scarlcl and Blast)

STILLWATERiA desperate si -
point rally by the Oklahoma Aggies
in the final minutes of play against
the Grinnell college basketball team
here Monday night was of no avail
when the Pioneers came back in the
overtime period to annex the 25—22 de-
cision.

It was the first conference game
of the season for both Missouri Val-
ley teams and the second triumph of
the year for the Pioneers who had
previously defeated Drake in a non-
conference game.

With three minutes left in the
game. the Pioneers held a 21-15 ad-
vantage but Bruner, Highfill, and
Shirk brought the fans to their feet
with a sensational attack that scored
a trio of field goals.

Ullrich, Rowe Tally

Ullrich and Rowe tallied for Grin~
hell with long shots during the over
time period while the best the Cow-
boys could show was a gift toss by
Shirk. At halftime, after the lead
had gone from one team to the other,
Grinnell led, 12 to 11.

Highfill of the Aggies was top
scorer for the evening with 12 points
