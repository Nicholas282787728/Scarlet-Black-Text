Pioneers Seek Revenge

flu? 28-23 Defeat
at Tulsa

By Jim Bradley

The Pioneers clash with the
Tulsa Hurricane five her-e tonight
at 7:30 o'clock in a Missouri Val-
ley conference classic, with the
Pioneers seeking to regain winningl
ways.

The strife will have no serious
bearing on the league standings
Tulsa occupying fourth place and
the Pioneers sharing the bottom
post with Washington university.

Aggies Trounce Tulsa

Last Tuesday night the emo-
homa Aggies scored an overr
whelrning victory of 33-14 over the
Hurricane aggregation, holding
the Tulsans to three field goals.
but the disastrous defeat gives no
proof of Tulsa‘s weakness, nor does
it throw any light on the outcome
of tonight's battle.

in the three game relationship
between the two rivals. Grinnell
has emerged the victor but once.
Tulsa‘s command of its uncanny
mtating type of offense has ale
ways bafﬂed the Grinnell defense,
the Hurricane players consistently
breaking away from their oppo-
nents to score on short shots.

Jones Hurricane Star

Jones, star center and Hurri—
cane sophomore, will not be of any
help toward the Crinneii cause.
According to sport critics, he is
probably the cleverest bail handler
and floor man in the Valley con—
ference competition. and will be a
constant menace ‘ to the Grinnell
machine tonight. it is doubtful if
Julie Bauer, Pioneer regular cen-
ter, will be able to compete, ac-
cording to Coach J. C. Truesdale,
Grinneli mentor,

A Tulsa victory will move the
Hurricane team up into a tie with
Drake for third place, and a set-
back will knock it down in a tie
with Woshburn for the fifth berth.

Gentlemen, Have You These Qualifications?
If Not Grinnell Co—ecls Won’t Marry You

girls are out looking for their ideal
husbands. But from the qualificar
tions that some of them listed. it
will be a colder winter than this
before they find any one so ideal.

Virginia Clark '39, has quite
definite ideas as to her ideal; he
must be a good-looking brunette,
at least three years older than she
is. He must be intelligent, a good
dancer, a neat dresser, and very
tall. She’d like a professional
man, doctor preferredsnd wouldn't
object to glasses, because they give
a man “that distinguished air.”
Oh, yes! He must think she's the
one and only.

Wants Husband Older

A good disposition is one of the

assets that Marjorie Mains ‘39, in-

sists on. She wants her husband
three or four inches taller than;
she is. He should have a sense of
humor and need not be handsome,
but rather nice—looking. A lawyer
or a doctor is her preference, and
he must like the Sunny South,
horses, dogs, and children.

Jerry Allyn, '37, wants a hus—
band with high ideals, some semr
biance of brains, and appreciation
of the arts. He mustn't be too
slowia bit of the Grinnell spring
technique would not be amiss, and
he must keep her guessing. “There
are two things I insist on,” she
said. “He must brush his teeth'
without a lot of noise, and he has
to like my cooking."

Must Hear Alarm Clock

A husband who always hear-s

She never hears it herself. Among
lother things she wants are a sense
,of humor, good dancing, intelli-
gence, and a liking for dogs. She
wants him to make enough money
l that they can travel, and she hopes
that non remember their wedding
anniversary now and then.

Equal appreciation of the north
woods, Browning, and the music of
Grieg, are what Eve James '37,
wants in a husband. He need not
be handsome, but must be "inter
esting looking." He must appreci—
Iatc clothesihas in particular, and
must like to "bum around the
woods" as she calls it. "And if he
ever gives me a vacuum cleaner-
