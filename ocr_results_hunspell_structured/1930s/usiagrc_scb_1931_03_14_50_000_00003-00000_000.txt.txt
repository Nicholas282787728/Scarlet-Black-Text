Faculty, Students, Meet to
Discuss New Grade System;
Creative Tests Considered

Twelve faculty members and stu»
dents representing each of the build~
ings met Wednesday night for dinner,
followed by a conference in Gates
.clubroom about the present grading
system in Grimell.

The relative merits of the present
system of grading and that of having
only two marks, pass and fail, were
discussed. A vote was taken to dis-
cover the attitudes of the several
persons present, and it revealed that
the majority was in favor of the
passfall method of grading.

The discussion was turned to other
questions brought up at the last colr
lege forum, and a few remarks coll-
ceining the merits and practicality of
the creative examination were iven.

The conference was another at—
tempt to secure relations between
faculty and students, according to
Robert Bradford. The faculty meme
hers attending the conference were:
Mr. Beatty. Miss Lowden, Mr. Charl-
ton, Mr. Bauman, Miss McCanoiess.

We have recently received a letter
from Mrs. Hattie Hammond giving
the opinion of one, Thomas Nunez,
l'e_gerding the pronunciation of
“Iowa.” He has three pronunciations
but seems to prefer Ioway. Here we
pronounce it Iowan, People from
New England who came here pro-
nounced it Inch-way accenting the.
second syllable. That is the way it
was pronounced by the senior of the
Herald before he came to this state
and learned the western pronuncia»
tion. If you want to pronounce it
right in this state say lowah. If you
go to New England and wish to pro-
nounce it as they do accent the sec-
ond syllable. If you follow the trend
of Thomas Nunan it don’t make any

 

difference how you pronounce it. We

Some of our readers remember
that one night last week ex-mayor
T. A. Potter of Mason City was burn-
ed in his own home when the house
caught fire in the night and he was
unable to get out of it until it had
spread so much as to cut off his ass
cape. a small number here knew
Mr. Potter personally. others would
be interested to know that Mr. Pot-
ter was one of the incorporators of

the Eggleston Bus company. Mr.
Potter was a strong man in northern
Iowa and well known in almost every
circle.

LACK and white fol:
spring. That is the sat-
est rule to follow. It is smart
and looks well on nearly
every girl. And of course for
that black print dress or that
new black coat and black
Watteau hat with the perky
white flower, you will need
shadow black hose. Nothing
ads so much to a costume as
hose, and black ones are
smart. BRINTNALL'S will
help you out on that score.

ARE you starving for
sweets? Bo these spring-
liko nights fill you with an
unutterabla longing? Rush
down to LARGE'S. seat your-
self in front of the counter.
Then order a butter brickle
