World Economic
Philosophy Wrong
Declares Strong

Earl D, Strong, professor of ccc.
nomics delivered the series of chapel
addresses from Monday through
Thursday last week. The period on
Monday was devoted to a memorial
service in keeping with Armistice day.
The topic of the following lectures
was, "Christianity and Economics,"

In his second talk, Professor Strung
compared the theory of Adam Smith
upon which the study of economics
has been based, and the theory of i'c-
ligion~which is based on the love of
God. He brought up the question of
whether man's Selfish interest Canever
bring about a I'econcilliation between
the two,

Wednesday, the speaker pointed out
that the economic system is built
on an individual basis, on the false
corollary that human nature cannot
be changed. Under the present sys-
tem undue emphasis is placed on pr .
{its and insufficient Consideration is
given to the public welfare. The
assumption that human nature is un—
changeable is unscientific, outmoded,
and even un-Christian, asserted the
speaker.

On Thursday, Mr. Strong stated that
the correct economic system would
idealistically be based on the teachr
ings of Jesus “If we build
into the economic system at Christ»
like attitude we will have a method
of approach to the solution of the
situation today," he declared. Them
cannot be a Conflict between Chris.
tianity and economics if a solution
to our present deficiencies is to be
found, concluded the speaker.

Wallace Gives
Ideas on How

to End Crisis

Secretary Advocates Means
for Immediate Action

on Key Problems

“Some mechanism which will make
it possible for intelligent individuals
to express themselves on key condi-
tions, while completely free from par.
ty politics and class consciousness, is
vitally necessary in the United States'
program for economic recovery." so
declared Secretary of Agriculture
Henry Wallace yesterday morning in
the opening address of the fourth an-
nual Grinnell Conference on Internal.
tioal Relations.

Speaking on the topic, “We are All
Members, One of Another," Secrctary
Wallace sought to offer a constructive
plan for economic recovery involving
a system of “double entry bookkeep.
ing” between nations and between
classes.

Holding to Past

“Individual psychology holds to
the attitude of the past, of the fron-
tier days, the speaker Said, Claiming
that this belief in the economic order
of that time is acting as a barrier
against the attainment of world peace
and order.

Quoting from a report by the Brook.
iugs institute of Washington D, C.,
Mr. Wallace pointed out that at pres.
cut, 60 per cen of the families in this
country are 1i mg on incomes of
$2,000 or less and receive less than
23V: per cent of the total national in—
come; while a group which includes
less than 1.2 per cent of the total pop.
ulation receives 33 per cent of the
total income.

- Furnished Leadeiship

Since the World War the latter
has furnished the country’s leadership;
leader-ship which, the speaker stated,
“has not possessed the wisdom nor co.
herence to do either the good or evil
things with which it has been accred»
itted,”

Since the war, continued the speak.
er, the economic positions of the
United States and Germany are just
the reverse of what they wem pre-
ceding the conflict, Becoming a cred.
itor nation as a result of the war, the
United States adopted the same world
trade policy as that of England. The
latter loaned money to other countries,
expecting and desiring goods in tum.
While this could be done profitably
by England, a small island nation,
the United States soon became ems
barrassed by the necessity for a huge

Intercepted Pass Furnished

Scoring Opportunity

By WELLS BARNETT
Handicapped by lack of time to
work on fundamentals and to polish
their own offensive, a hard.driving
Grinnell freshman football team was
beaten here Friday afternoon by
Drake’s powerful prep outfit, 7.0. The
Grinncll fresh plainly showed the
need for more work on blocking, as
their offense was consistently bottled
up by the alert Drake forwards.

The Drake score came as a result
of Hall’s interception of a Grinnell
pass on his own 20—yard line. He
raced to the Little Pioneer's 35-yard
stripe, where he was pulled down from
behind by Bill Sampson. O’Brien,
Sutcr, and Setrakiau then combined
to move the ball to the three.yard
marker, and O’Brien smashed over
for the touchdown, A pass from Sutc-r
to Williams was good for the extra
point,

Some good potential material for
next year's Pioneer varsity was un.
covered iu the game. Dayl Evans,
husky guard, and James Ramsey, at
end, were outstanding in defensive
play, while Sampson, Clow, Copper,
Schlotterbeck, and Kelly, hacks, look.
ed the best on offense . For Drake,
O'Brien and Setrakran wcrc outstand.
