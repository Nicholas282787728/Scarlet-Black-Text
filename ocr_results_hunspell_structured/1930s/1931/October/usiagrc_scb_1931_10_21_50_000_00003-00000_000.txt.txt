Displaying their best form this
season, Clark hall men continued on
their march to the 1931 speedbell title
by defeating Gates hall, 1930 champ—
ions, Tuesday afternoon, 12 to a. The
defending champions still have an
outside chance to win, however. Dib~
hle, having two games to replay, is
second with one victory and no de-
feats.

A dark horse has come to the
front in the stson hell team, and
may seriously threaten the chances
of Dihhle and Clark, the two remain-
ing teams on its schedule. This outfit
defeated Smith and Langan. losing
to Gates earlier in the year. Gates is
in fourth place, while neither Smith
nor Langan has broken into the win
column.
