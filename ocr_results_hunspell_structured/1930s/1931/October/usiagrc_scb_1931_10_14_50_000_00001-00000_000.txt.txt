Creighton Coach Suggests
Changes After Drake Loss

(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

OMAHA—That radical changes
might appear in the Creighton vars-
ity lineup this week was indicated by
Coach Arthur stark today.

Failings appeared at right guard
and right end, and “Red" Moran. 1804
pound sophomore, showed surprising
ability when inserted into the lineup
at halfback. _

Herluf Jllul, ZDDrpound sophomore
reserve tackle, may be shifted to
right guard to bolster that position,
stark hinted, and LaVerne Wolf,
sophomore end, may replace the vet-
eran Dorwart in the first string line-
up.

F rosh Eleven
to Meet Coe

Yealrlings in First Test

Here Friday Night

The Grinnell college freshman foot-
ball eleven will get its ﬁrst test of
college competition Friday night
when the yearlings encounter the
Con college freshmen on Ward ﬁeld.
This is the only date approved by
the faculty committee, but the Pio-
neers will play another game, either
with Drake or State Teachers.

Coach John C. Truesdaie’s starting
lineup is in doubt since many of the
fresh have not seen much work
yet. The “little Pioneers” will have
a heavy team, outweighing the vars-
ity.

Truesdale has four available cen—
ters, McMillan, Morgan, Edsall. and
Murray. 1f McMillan-s knee is in
shape, it is probable that he will get
the call and each of the others will
be found at a different position.

Paired with Murray at end, will be
either Henningsen, Brown, Phelps, or
Anderson. At tackles, Morgan, Art
Mellrath, brother of Howard. who

College Story
Student Topic
at Convocation

Grinnell History Reveals

Continual Progress,
Steady Growth

The history of Grinnell college is
a story of steady progress and
growth according to the speakers at
the second all-college convocation of
the year Monday morning in Herrick
chapel.

Robert Blasier, speaking on “Bee
ginnlngs” traced the story of Grin»
nell from its founding in 1844 by the
lewa Band who came west from And-
over seminary, through its changes
and moves until it was rebuilt in
1332 after the tornado.

Traces (lo-Education

Faith Somcrs traced the growth of
coeducation from 1860 when the first
girl entered Grinnell in the person of
Joanna Harris Haines until the pres-
ent time. The women‘ self governs
ment league was organized 20 years
ago this month with Mabel Welch as
president.

The period between 1514 and 1917
was one of great building expansion
1according to George Van Nostrand
who summarized recent Crinnell his-
tory. The women's quadrangle, Alum-
ni Recitation hall and the men’s
dormitories were built during those
three years.

Changcs After War

Changes came after the war when
dancing and tobacco made their ap-
pearance. The men’s council of house
chairmen, which was organized in
1928, was preceded by a men's court
and senate which met every two
weeks.

The convocation was presided over
by President John s. Nollen. Music
was furnished by the vesper choir.
The assemblies are under the super
vision of the student council and are
held once a month.

Pilbrow Places First
in Cross-Country Meet

Myron Pilbrow, ace of thc Grinnell
college Crossecountry team, showed
his heels to a lengthy ﬁeld of cone
testants from the University of Iowa
and Cornell college in the triangular
meet held at Mt, Vernon Saturday
held between the Cornell-crinnell
homecoming game. The race was run
in a downpour which made sure footr
ing imposible. Pilbrow led by a come
fortable margin over McIntyre of
Cornell.

Taking second, third, and fourth,
Cornell annexed thc meet, surprising
the University of Iowa team. The
ﬁnal score was Cornell 25; Iowa 45;
Crinnell 52. Cornell won the Midwest
conference championship last year.

Buttoning Likenecl to Apple-Bucking
by Frosh on Eve of Cap Ceremony

uPreparatory hats are an integral
part of our estimable interclass sys—
tem, so the upperclassmcn Say,” said
Paul Trigg, Jr., the man from Mon-
tana, and an innocent member of the
class of 1934. in a recent inteiview.

"Not so the freshmen, however."
continued Mr. Trigg. "As a freshman
I conﬁdentially predict that, after
the preparatory hats are distributed
at the Coe freshman football contest,
I shall button for the next six weeks.
Butihe who buttons last buttons
best:

“Buttonlng is a survival of a bar-
baric age remniscent of that endear-
ing old Halloween sport known as
apple ducking, However, the result-
ing rewards for the two sports are
quite in contrast. This, though, is a
subject about which most of the
freshmen will probably feel touchy.

“There is one way of stopping
buttoning. If a freshman will only
stand in a corner and button Indeﬁn-
itcly, every one will soon be so tired
of seeing him button that he will
not have to button any more. That is,
he Wlll be buttuuless.”

Mr. Trigg is expressing the sent!»
ments of the body or new men in
Gl‘innell as they look toward time for
n18 freshman game. As this resident
or halogen hall indicates, they wnl
oe very touchy about the matter.
ihis includes lvlr. Trigg himself.

Both the upper-classiiien and the
preps are looking forward, with mix»
cd emotions, to this event of mid-Oc-
tobereand, what time could be more
appropriate for the revrval of this
whimsical old custom called apple-
ducking?

 

Faculty Votes
Longer Holiday
at Thanksgiving

Grinnell students will not be re-
quired to attend classes on Friday,
Nov. 27, the day following Thanks-
giving, this year, it was decided in a
meeting of the college faculty Mon-
day afternoon.

This action followed a petition for
a vacation on that day by the student
council. a discussion with faculty
members in Lantern meeting, and ex-
pression of editorial opinion in The
Scarlet and Black.

students obtained such a change
last year by agreeing to attend
classes on a Saturday later in the
year. This plan was carried out and
the 1931-32 calendar was arranged
with Friday classes again scheduled
following the holiday. The longer
1031-32 academic year makes it pos—
Sible to allow the holiday this year
without scheduling claSses on another
day.

Thomas Star in 6-0 Win
on Muddy Gridiron
‘atCornell

With the first three games of the
season in the past, Coach L. L.
(Fuzz) Watt has two weeks to round
his men into shape for the St. Louis
university game at St. Louis, Oct.
24. The Pioneers have chalked up
three victories this season against no
defeats, and have amassed 44 points,
while holding opponents scoreless.

Monday, Coach Watt sent his re-
serves through a scrimmage game
with the freshmen squad, who battle
the One yearling-s on Ward field Fri—
day night. He will forsake intensive
drill for the rest of the week in order
to allow some of the men on the in»
jured list to recover.

Grafliuid Back

Power plays into the line were in
order yesterday, with a short scrim»
mage against the reserves following.
Graflund, James, and Duncan of the
injured list were in uniform but did
not take active part in the work.

Battling in rain and mud through-
out the entire second half, the»Pio~
neers held a heavier Cornell college
eleven on even terms and maintained
the six-point margin which they had
obtained in the first half in the fea—
ture attraction of the Cornell home-
coming festivities Saturday.

Play Waiting Game

The Pioneers played a waiting
game, kicking on first and second
down, and until late in the second
quarter neither team held an ad-
vantage. At that point, Lake recov-
ered a fumble in midfield, and a pass
to Ullricli put the ball in position to
score. Again Thomas passed to Dun—
can, who made a neat catch of the
high toss, and crossed the goal line
for his fourth touchdown of the sea-
son.

Earlier in the game, the Pioneers
threatened when Thomas carried the
ball to the one.yaro llnn nut on the
next play. Cornell recovered a scar-
let and black fumble behind the goal
line for a touchback.

Thomas Star

Throughout the second half. a val.
iant Cornell team made a desperate
effort to score. In the closing minute
