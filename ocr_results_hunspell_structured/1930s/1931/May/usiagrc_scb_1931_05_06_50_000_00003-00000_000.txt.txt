Someone ought to show Helen
Larsen around Marshalltown. It
must have been a triile coninsing
for her to look out the window and
see across the street the hotel she
thought she was in. Marshalltown
hotels are as a rule very wells
behaved, and not inclined to do
much running around. We can only
conclude that Miss Larsen made a
mistake.

Did you know that Leonard Sells'
father was owner of the Sells-Floto
Circus? It's a fact. That‘s why Leon—
ard didn't go to school last year‘he
was busy helping dad shoot lions in
the wilds of Africa.

In case his vivid account o1 lilo in
the jungle doesn’t convince you, Leon-
ard has an African coin that proves
everything

“he undestand that some members

at the Iaeulty have hecome very adept
at c|imbin~ in and out oi windows,

Grinnell's delegation to the college
press convention at Coe returned with
the belief that maybe this is leap-
year after all! Professor Colbert
played Sir Launcelot for Cornell‘s
feminine representative at the dance.
and then added 30 miles to the speed-
ometer of the new Ford tudor. It is
15 miles from Cedar Rapids to Mt.
Vernon, isn‘t it?
