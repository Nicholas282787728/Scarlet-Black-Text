However, it is necessary for it college to llzlvc
some record of studcllts’ work other than these
three classiﬁcations. Some people, ‘iwho have given
a great deal of thought to the subject, rccolulnclld
that the instructor itc a discriminating rrport
of each student’s work for permanent record. The
student, himself would not be given this report, but
the college wollld have the instructor s estimate of
the student’s ability, work, and suoc ss ill lieu Of
grades.

Such a system would continue to Stimulate the
scholar to do his best, as the present grading plan
is supposed to do. Ill addition. it would really be
fairer to the student in the long run, because he

BODY 0R MIND FIRST? ,

Failure of participants ill intramural llthlctics
at Griuncll college to train makes the activity
harmful. Supervisors for both tllc quadrangle and
dormitories are needed to take charge of deﬁnite
workouts before contests in order that students
will not suffer physically

The intramural c Os -country meet is the one
strenuous event for which training regulations as
sure preparedness of cont touts. Practices of
smoking and little sleep, will l are not tolerated
in training for varsity athletics, lcavc dormitory
participants ill spccdball, basketball, water polo,
and baseball in bad condition for much physical
exertion.

Grillllcll v21 sity athletics guarantee supcl all
training before llll athlete is permitted to engage in
intercollegiate competition. Rules are enforced that
insure the physical ﬁtness of contestants through-
out the season of the sport.

THIS PUNCTUAL SPOT
(From the Daily qu-aii)

By KENNETH BRAUN, Davenport high school

The Iowa high school journalism conference is being
held at Iowa city today and tomorrow. I am scheduled
to enter an editorial contest at 1:30 pm. today. I arrive
at the building at 1:35 p.m. Prof. Fred J. Lazell is ex
plalning the rules governing this contest. I hear only
half of them. Now I must write this editorial without
the airl of about half the rules, Perhaps it will be well

if I preach a little sermon to myself.

Here you are. You are ﬁve minutes late. can you
m've an account of yourself? No? Then why not? Don't
you know that punctuality is one of the necessary
cardinal habits of a journalist?

For the sake of an example, let us pretend that you
are Harry T. Brundidge, St. Louis Star reporter. Harry,
you were assigned to cover the Lingle murder in Chie
csgo. You are now in St. Louis, The St. Louis to Chi-
cago passenger airplane leaves the ﬁeld at 1:30 pm.
You must "catch” that plane in order to get into Chir
cago. But, you arrived there at 1:35 pm. What would
the Star think of you as a reporter? What do you say?
Harry Wouldn't do that? He's always punctual? Oh,
yes, opt you must remember, he is a journalist. He
can't be late.

Anyway, Harry is in Chicago now. Being in Chicago
is a nightmare for Harry. He's shadowed, he’s spied on,
he's bothered and worried in hundreds of ways. He gets
his stories in, however, punctuauy every da . For that
reason, combined with his journalistic abi ty, Harry
is known and praised for his work wherever he goes.

Would you like to succeed as well as he?

Surely? Then you had better ﬁnish this lit-tie sermon
to yourself and trot down to Iowa union, because the
next session starts there in ﬁve minutes.

COLLEGE BOYS MUST BEHAVE
(From the Oklahoma A. and M. Daily UCollegilm)

Another example of the precarious position occu-
pied hy college hay editnrs came to the front recently
with the suspension of an editor of a Paciﬁc coast
college paper.

The editor of the Ubyssey, undergraduate paper
of British Columbia, maintained the policy of printing
statements of people opposed in thought to those of
the college authorities. The president gave the editor
a warning and, when it was disregarded, addressed the
hellicose journalist in such terms: “I forbade you to
publish any criticism, editorially or otherwise, of the
university, the faculty, or the governmentil therefore
suspend you—." And the editor took a vacation from his
editorial duties.

The publication board failed to support the presi-
dent in his policy, and immediately suspended public ~
tion of the U'byssey until the deposed head was rel .
stated. The situation is as yet unsettled.

Position of most college editors is a peculiar one.
SO long as they speak on questions which are of little
concern to vital campus matters they are allowed to
grow extreme in their writings, but once they step, even
very lightly, on the administration's toes it is a different
tale.

A, and M. and the Daily O'Ccllegian are fortunate
in having an administration which is not overrsensitive
in the way it is treated by Lhe college paper. We have
never so much as had a reprimand from President Ben-
nett. In appreciation of the policy of hands off which
he has maintained, the Daily O'Collegian has, and will
in the future, do all in its humble power to aid the
administration.

We do not intend to sidestep issues, or to avoid
speaking where we think corrections are necessary, but
this newspaper can ever be depended upon as a staunch
supporter of the men at Whitehurst.

‘ Employment Tips

“Do you have any men in your
senior class who have gone out
and hustled during the summers
selling Real Silk, Wear-Ever
aluminum, magazmes, ole." is a
question frequently asked by busi-
ness men looking for promising
sales recruits.

The college graduate of the
sales type not only ﬁnds it easy
to secure a position, but is better
paid than most of his classmates.
A summer spent in pushing door»
bells, even though it results in
little money, is a prpﬁtable experi-
ence.
