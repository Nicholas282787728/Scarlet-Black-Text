Students Compete

in $50,000 Contestl

(Continued from page 1)
With more than a million letters
received since the deadline at mid
night March 4, returns indicate that
a small army of college students
burned the midnight oil in hopes of
supplementing their regular incomes
with the $25,000 ﬁrst prize.

The percentage of college contest-
ants is believed to lie consideinlily
higher than is apparent, since only
those who added their class and Col»
lege to the entries could be identiﬁed

by the examiners as college students.‘

At least an equal number entered the
contest, lint were modestly silent con-
cerning their collegiate afﬁliations.
