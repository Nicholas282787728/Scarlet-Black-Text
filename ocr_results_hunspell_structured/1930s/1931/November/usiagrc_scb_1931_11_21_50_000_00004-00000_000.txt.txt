social standardization. He spoke of
speed, stress, train, dust. dirt, and
noise as another liability.

New illiteracy, the loss of the art
of play, technological unemployment,
and overspecialization he also placed
in this group.

“We have too much wheat and'too
little bread, too much cotton and too
few clothes, too many shoe factories
and too few shoes," declared Mr.
chase, “and if we go on inventing
for the next 25 years, we’ll have 45
men doing the work now done by 70,
and requiring 100 men a few years
ago." -

Members of the present Big Si
conference once members of the Ml
souri Valley conference formed their
own conference a few years ago.
Drake, a Missouri valley team, upset
the dope last week by defeating the
leading team in the Big Six, 7 to 6.

While the score of that contest at
Ames was close, the Bulldogs out-
played the Cyclones the first half
and a greater part of the second
half to show the Big Six that while
Missouri Valley teams usually pay
homage to them, they are not in-
vulnerable.

YES, FOLKS

There is a good place to
stop in after the trip to Des
Moines, or in fact most any
time that the desire strikes
you. The SHADY GROVE
INN is right on the way
home from Des Moines, and
is just far enough out to
make it an interesting drove
from Crinnell. When you
stop to think of it, 21/2 miles
is really n nice little hike, ,if
you are so inclined. Why not
try it some time Soon?

brittle and fresh pecans
from EDWARDS Grocery.
All sorts of goodies that
tempt the taste you can pur»
