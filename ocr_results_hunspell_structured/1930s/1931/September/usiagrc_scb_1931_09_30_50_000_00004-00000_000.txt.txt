THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Women Build
Future World
Steiner ‘Says

Grinnell Professor Speaks
at University of Iowa

Vespers Sunday

(Speoinl to The Scarlet and Black)

IOWA CITY~Wolnan, according
to Dr. Edward A. Steiner, professor
of applied Christianity at Grluuell
college, will be responsible for the
new world if such is to come. He
expressed this view in an address at
the vesper service at the University
ioi Iowa Sunday,

Since Eve lcnrncd licr lesson in the
Garden of Eden, woman has been
man's comforter and guide according
to Dr. Steiner. Instinctively she has
known the difference between right
and wrong No matter how bad she
ihas become at times she did not her
icomc as bad as man.

Master Builders
if there is a new world the ”new
Woman” will have to be responsible
”Women must become master builde
ers of our future Civilization," the
speaker said,
“These new women have their
minds renewed. Therefore they dis-
cern the eternal from the superficial,
the profound from the superficial.
What they know is worth knowing
and what they do is worth doing.

Broken Bars

“Woman is much freer today. She
has broken through all the seraglios;
all the bars set up by man to hold
her down.

"That is the new woman which is
not yet numerous.

"I know that she may be as ruth-
less as man." the Grinnell professor
continued, “as devoid of conscience
or shame. But she cannot be as bad
as man and she can only become
|worse when she tries."

Booth were in Des Moines Sunday.

number of colleges. It has 41. New

The musty smell of relics of an
age long since dead fills the ease
rooms of the Blair hall museum. This
museum was donated to Iowa college
by chry Webster Park-er, who was
an instructor of chemistry and natuv
al science in Grinnell,

The first museum in old East col»
lege burned in 1870; the second was
destroyed in 1882 by the tornado and
fire. The third and successful at
tempt to found a museum resulted
in the present one. ‘

Tusk Found Here

There is little doubt that few peo—
ple think of this collection of antiques
as anything ﬁne or precious and few
study it. Yet Blair hall, with its
arches, its spiral stairway, and its
cinssrooms, stands benignly, housing
its treasures with a genuinc dignity.

The steps of the old stairway
creak under the feet of the observer.
and as one reaches the top of the
first flight the tusk of a giant mam-

moth is directly before him, This
tusk was found in Grinnell at the
corner of Main and Fourth streets
in 1884. Scientists say that these
creatures grew to the height of nine
feet, were its feet long and had tusks
nine feet long.

Lanterns Found

Near this relic are baskets of heads
of the mound builders. These were
found in Pittsburg, 1a., and were so
aged they were not dated. They do
not appear to be as old or decayed
as did most of the relics, and seem
strangely apart from the atmosphere
of things that are old.

Incidentally there are a dozen or
more lanterns in a case on the hal—
cony o Blair, which might have
proven cful to coeds during the
storm the other evening when the
lights were out. They date back to
a time when glass was so expensive
that it was rarely used in lanterns.
