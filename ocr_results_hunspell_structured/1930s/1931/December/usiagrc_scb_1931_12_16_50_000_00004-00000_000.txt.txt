Drake university's basketball team
is unique in that it is comprised of
nearly all sophomores. It is probable
that an all-second~year quintet will
Open the season against the pioneers
Friday, since Schultz is the only vct-
eran regular on the squad.
4. e s
Probably there will be three former
Roosevelt high school guards in the
starting lineup Friday. Dick ullrich,
Crinncll. and Dave Abl‘am‘and Wayne
Xanders, Drake, are the trill. ‘A;
icurth. Harold Jenks, Drake, will
probably see action.

Roosevelt, which for the last four
years has reached the district finals
and twice came within an ace of an-
nexing the state title, has amazed
court followers this season with a.
54-3 win over Bondurant, and a 7376
victory over Osceola, Harris CoggesV
hall, one of Grinnell's famous court
and net stars, is a Roosevelt product.
s s s
The Oklahoma Aggies dropped the
first three games of their ncrthern
tourto StateTeachers. Carleton, and
Minnesota. Against Carleton, the
Cowboys' 21 points were fewer than
the total of 23 counted by Dick
Arney, Carleton forward, and former
Marshelltown athlete.

Before the largest crowd to wit
hess a Bluejsy basketball game in six
years, the Creighton five made an
auspicious beginning by upsetting
the University of Southern California
Trojans, 25 to 17, to demonstrate the
merit of Missouri valley conference
basketball.

Maurice van Ackeren, Creighton
captain, will attempt to hold his
Missouri Valley scoring crown, which
he won last year, besting Frank Dun-
left—handed scoring
ace.

an irrisistablc force met an immov-
able object? Basketball fans may sec
the solution to this problem Saturday
when the irresistablc offense of the
Brigham Young university cagers
meets the immovable defense of the

in Omaha,

Creighton's fivc, having engaged
in the “battle of champions" with the
University of Southern California
last week, has one victory to its cred-
it already while the Mormons have
vanquished five quintets to date.

The play of the two teams in their
games so far has been marked by
widely varying features. in winning
over the Trojans by a 25 to 17 score,
Creighton presented a
which held the coast quintet to five
field goals. The Mormons, on the
other hand, have demonstrated a
devastating offense in their five
games, totalling 275 points.

i Campus Opinion

Do you Im'ol' triple-cut penalty for
absences before and after vacation
periods? '

Roberta stanlrery: I think the
triple-cut system is much more demo-
cratic and fair to the students who
cannot afford dcilnr cuts.

Chris ithynshurger: The triple-cut
system is about as far advanced as
our present day way of grading. On
second thought, it is superior. It gives
you more money for Christmas pres-
ents.

Helen Williams: rd rather pay a
dollar, but I don't think it's fair to
all the students.

Myron Pilbraw: I don’t mind «the
cuts because 1 can afford. them, but
a choice would he fairer for all stu-
dents.

Maurine Hudson: 1 can't afford to
lcse the cuts this year, but before 1
preferred the triple-cut system.

warren Huggins: Given a chcice I
would take the cuts. They are cheap
er and fairer to everyone.

Christmas as related to the college
campus provides the theme for the

January Malteaser, issued today and
dedicated to its absent editor. Stan
