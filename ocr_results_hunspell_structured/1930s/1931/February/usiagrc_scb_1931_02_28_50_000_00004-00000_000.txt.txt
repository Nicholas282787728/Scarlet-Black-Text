Dibble Cagers
Trounce Smith
for Title, 17-10

Six’s Combined A, B Team
in Lead Throughout
Game Friday

Dibble hall‘s combined A and B
teem trounced Smith hall representa-
tives, 17 to 10, in the championship
game, of the intramural basketball
tournament yesterday afternoon, The
regular series ended in a tie between
Six and One, and the battle yester-
day was the playoff of the deadlock.

The courthouse quintet led the en-
tire tilt by displaying a tastrbreaklug‘
offense that completely bathed Smith.
Hemphill and Lichty starred for the
winners, each collecting four points.

Dibble Leads, 9 to 7. at Half

Dibble jumped into an early lead
when Hemphili sank a short goal on
a pass from Lichty. One tied the
count as Southwick dropped a long
basket. Lichty of Dibble countered
with a lucky shot over his head, and
from this point on Six showed a de-
cided advantage and, although Smith
bombarded the victors goal from time
to time, the losers were unable to
find the basket for counters.

The score at halftime was 9 to 7
in favor of Dibble.

Editor

The Scarlet and Black
Grinnell, Towa.

Dear Sir:

Perhaps the most popular topic of
conversation on the campus during
the last week has been Grinnell's first
allscollege open forum. Now that we
have had a week to think over the
matter, we wonder just what the
forum accomplished.

1. Did the open forum accomplish
its purpose? The purpose of the for~
um, as conceived/ by the instigators
of the movement, was to provide a
meeting place for students and facul»
ty members in order to allow frank
and candid opinions to be openly ex-
pressed about current campus prob-
lems vital in the lives of each ele-
ment.

That the forum accomplished this
end is indisputable. Students and
faculty alike were surprised at the
number of responses brought out by
the topic of discussion. Whether
these responses offered anything
constructive towards the combating
of the problem, is of relatively small
importance.

The fact remains that Grinnell stu-
dents and Grinnell faculty members
arose in a common meeting place
and gave vent to their honest opin-
ions about a delicate question. Such
is the purpose of open forums in gen-
eral, and from this viewpoint we can
term our first forum a great success.

2. How can our next open forum
be improved? In talking with var-
ious members of the student body
and the faculty I gathered» some
criticisms of the first forum. one
general complaint was that there
should have been some conclusion
drawn from the whole affair. Another
was that there should be one person
who would open the question for dis-
cussion by defining the terms and by

ﬁrst. Child Art Rooms.

outlining the real issues 0! the ques-
tion as quickly and as comprehens-
ively as possible. Another suggestion
was made that the speakers limit
themselves to one minute each.

Looking fairly at these criticisms,
which were given with true sincerity.
we see several helpful suggestions for
conducting our next meeting. Per-
haps there should have been some
conclusion drawn from the meeting.
However, in my opinion, the sugges—
tion of having some speaker open the
meeting with a clear definition of
terms and with a decisive delineation
of issues bears more weight.

It is extremely doubtful whether any
one person could have drawn a fitting
conclusion to the meeting. mainly be«
cause the opinions brought out in
the meeting were of such a diversi-
fied nature. To attempt to boil
down the statements presented into
a set conclusion would have spoiled
the effect of the open forum,

It seemed to me that there was a
definite need for some speaker's open<
ing the meeting. We wasted perhaps
15 minutes of our limited time get-
ting at the heart of the matter. The
suggestion that the speakers be lim-
ited to one minute ‘is worthy of (mar
sideration at least. A one-minute
speech requires cnnciseness, and con-
ciseness in an open forum is hard to
get. But, we can all work for concise-
ness if we study the question that is
to be discussed, Then we will have
something in mind before we take
our turn in the forum,

These suggestions, adapted from
the criticisms, may prove exceeding
ly helpful in putting over our next
forum.

I wish to repeat that from all
sources 1 have heard favorable com-
ments on the first open forum, We
must realize that this first meeting
was an experiment and should be
recognized as such. but it is the Wish
of the Grinnell student body that this
idea may grow into a full-fledged
tradition, deserving the respect of
all.

Sincerely yours.
Lee Alexander.

Grinnell Debaters
Favor Fund Plan

(Continued from Page One)

to the plan presented, on the basis
that the burden rests on the cm-
ployer and that the period covered
by the insurance is .too short. This
plan, Mr. Johnson said, would in the
end only aggravate the situation and
perpetuate depression.

That the plan presented is practical
was the stand taken by Edward Dan-
forth of the afﬁrmative. He asserted
that unemployment insurance had of-
fered relief in other countries. and
gave as an example the British sysA
tem. The cost of one year of unemr
ployment is, according to Mr. Dah-

forth, more than Lhree million ii llars,
and the Cost of insurance admi istra-
tion would not be that high.
Step Toward Socialism

Emmet Blaes, concluding the de-
bate for the negative, said that be—
sides giving the laborer a, disinclinar
tion to work and an incliuntion to
depend upon the government, the
British plan is also a step toward
socialism.

in regard to the plan presented by
the afﬁrmative, he said that it would
deprive the employer of his freedom
in hiring and discharging employes.

James Dadant, who has been ab—
sent from classes since Monday on
account of the flu. is spending the
wekend at his home in Hamilton,
Ill.
