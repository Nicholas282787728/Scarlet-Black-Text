Grinnell Cagers Drop Game
to St. Louis by 27-11 Score

(Special to The Seal-let and Black)

ST. LOUIS—Tired after their hard
game with Washington university the
night before, Grinnell college basket-
ball players dropped an easy tilt ,to

.St. Louis university by a 2111 score

lhere Saturday night.

The Billikens opened with a strong
attack with which the Pioneers could
not cope, and the half ended, 21 to
11, in favor of the locals. In the sec-
ond period, second string men were
sent in by Coach Mike Nyikos, but
later the regulars reentered the
game.

Duncan ct Grinnell was not up to
his usual form and failed to get a
single ‘markel’. Scott, Douglas. Chris
toffersen, McCreary, and Ullrich each
accounted for one basket, while Mc-
Creary added to the score with a
free throw.
