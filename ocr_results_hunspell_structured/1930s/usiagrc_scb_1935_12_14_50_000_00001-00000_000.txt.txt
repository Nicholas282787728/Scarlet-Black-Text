21 Selections

The program of 21 selections

the orchestra, and win be followed
by “Comfort Ye My People ii “Ev-
ery Valley Shall Be Exalted." “And
the Glory of the Lord,” “Thus
Saith the Lord,” "But Who May
Abide," “Behold a Virgin Shall
Conceive "

“0 Thou That Tallest," “For Bar
hold Darkness," “For Unto Us a
Child Is Burn." The orchestra will

and the chorus wdl continue with
“There Were Shepherds and Lot
the Angel of the Lord," “And the
Angel Said unto Them," "And
Suddenly."

“Glory to God in the Highest"
“Glory to God in the Highest,
“Rejoice Greatly," “Then Shall the
Eyes of the Blind," "He Shall Feed
His Flock,” “Come unto Him,” and

the “Hallelujah" chorus.

The "Messiah" is frequently giv—
en by large choral societies but its
performance by a choir the size of
the Grinnell college Vesper choir is
more in keeping with the original
plan of performance of Handel's
works The choice of a small OI"
chestra to intensify rather than
overpower the work of the chorus
is likewise in the best of tradition.

departmcnt of miisio, said yester-

Different Superstitions
Broken at Dinner
on Friday 13

If you've never seen a real hone
‘est-to-goodness cream pic thrown
into the face of a real honesteto-
goodness blackface, you should
have been in on the annual Razz
Banquet sponsored by Sigma Delta
Chi. men’s professional journalism
fraternity. The Bronx cheer session
was held in the quadrangle dining
room last night, which. by the way.
was Friday, the thirteenth. and
'we’d venture to say that 90 per
cent of the guests crossed their
fingers when they walked under
the ladder into the room.

We'd guess again that still
other 50 per cent re-crossed them
when the two blackfaced comedi-
ans, James Cutforth and Bob
Moehl. chased a lanky black cat
around the dining room to start
the festivities.

The high spots of the evening,
ijudging by audience reaction, were
Dick Shirk's portrayal of Mr
Stoops, Archie Johnson in sweater
suit. toque and earrings as Mrs.
Leonard, Howard Whitney all done
up in curlers and {unlined slippers
as Margaret Wesson and the Tripe

please I can’t understand.” when

his lines.

“There are

two main reasons

lbattle played at Ames between the

two rivals.

After the first 10 minutes, Grin-

Grinnell Comes Back

At the beginning of the second
period. Grinnell slammed in three
quick buckets to come within three
points of tying the score, the count

Six forward, which the Grinnelli-
ans could not stem.

The Cyclone scorers were paced
by Flemming, Captain Holmes and
Thompson. Flemming collected 12
points, and the other two men
eight points each. These three men
could not only shoot, but were a
constant menace to the Pioneer
plays all night long, breaking in
for interceptions in addition to

Captain t‘liiphant was the only
