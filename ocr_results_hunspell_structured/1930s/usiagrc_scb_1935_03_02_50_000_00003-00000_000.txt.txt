Dibble Gets Most

(Continued From Page 1)

because he was the backbone oi the
strongest deiense in the league, Bley
oi Smith and Biklen oi Rawson are
the other two guards. Bley, a hold.
over ircln last year's team, led a com.
paritivcly weak Smith team to a sur.
prising record of three wins and two
losses.

Biklen, a very consistent player,
showed real ability though playing with
a woeluliy weak Kelly team which
went through a season without a win.
As Rawson's only defensive threat,
Biklcn tound himselt guarded by iive
men as a rule, but in spite oi this
handicap showed up well,

Kingery oi Dibble, Rex oi Langan,
and Ariano ot Gates are placed at tor.
wards on the B squad. They were the
league’s high scoring tor-wards and
there seems to he little doubt that
they were entitled to their positions,

Rossman oi Dibble and Henningsen

and good team players,

THE COLLEGIATE REVIEW

University sports in Germany are
still in their infancy, having been in.
troduccd only about 14 years ago by
ex.soldieis. Up to new they have con.
sidered dueling to be the only sport
worthy of them.

The legislature of Texas has killed
a resolution which would have given
former Gov, Alfalfa Bill Murray 3 pro.
tessoiship at the University of Texas.
They did admit, however, that he is a
“profound thinker."

Maybe you wonder why I appeal more than

others. Listen. Do you know that the top

leavzs of a tobacco plant are unripe and

biting? Do you know that the' bottom

leaves, trailing the ground, are grimy and

course? I know all that and for that reason

I am made from the fragrant, expensive

center leaves . t

. the leaves that give you

the mildest, best—tbstillg smoke. There—

fore, I sign myself “Your best friend.”
