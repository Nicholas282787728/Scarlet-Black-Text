Herr Adolph German Savior,
Kauffmann Declares

in Interview

Whatever the rest of the world may
think of the Hitler regime in Ger-
many, the average native of that COLIIL
try is all for him if the opinion of
Artur Kauffmann reflects that of his
countrymen. Kauffmanll, a German.
born Duhuquc contractor who is re.
pairing the marble work in the men’s
dormitories, was living in his home.
land a little oyer a year ago, and yes.

a dictatorial rule by thoso in power,

own ends at the expense of the little

wealthy class, Kauffman insisted he

gust for the rich is founded on their
failure to produce supplies toward the
end of the World War, thereby Coll.

feat.

When asked if the moral of the
