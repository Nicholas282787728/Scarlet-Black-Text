Pioneers Lose 3 Point
Lead in First Period,
Hold Ames to 28-26

Poor basket shooting cost the
Pioneers a game Monday night
as they fell before Iowa State
college at Aines by a 23.25 score.

The contest was a rough af-
fair almost all the way, with the
Pioneers leading only once, 9-6,
early in the contest. Iowa state
never held more than a fourepoint
lead at any stage of the game,
however.

Good Passing.

The game started well for the
Pioneers, who were in remark—
able passing form. After Iowa
State had dropped a couple of
free throws to open the scoring,
the Pioneers went ahead 9-6,
mostly through the efforts of
Bill Conwill. However Blahuik,
senior Cyclone guard, began to
take charge. and the iowa State
boys tied the game up at 9»all.
immediately after they surged
ahead and were never behind
again, At the half, the score
was 16414.
