Governing Bodies

Too Tolerant of

Nazi Agitators
——By R.i-:.M.——

The Hitler regime and its out
gxowths have created two situa-
tions in the last week which are
deserving of comment. They are
of interest because of the con-
trasting attitudes illustrated by
the reactions of the two occurr-
ences V

The first affair to command
notice was the meeting of 2/0,—
000 nienihers of the Germane
American lumd in Madison
Square Garden on the night of
Monday, Fell. 20. Ever since
there has been any Nazi agi-
tation in the United States, all
thinking people hai-e empha-
sized the importance of guar-
anteeing to everyone ireedoin of
speech, and rightly so.

One of the fundamental rights‘

in this country is the freedom to
express one’s views on any sub-
Jest, and the freedom to assemble
peaceably. However, when an or-
ganization holds a mass meeting,
and with its own private “army"
severely beats and iniures one
who disagrees with what is be»
ing said, this organization is not
only violating the right to peace-
able assembly, but also the. rights
of others to freedom of speech.
And yet, that is just what hape
pened at the Nazi mass meeting.
As the Des Moines Register
said in a recent editorial, what
a reaction there would be if a
c o m m u n i s t i c organization
should attempt such ii meeting,
with a company of uniformed
marchers going through mili-
tary drills in response to crisp
orders in Russian: Free speech
and freedom of peaceful as.
sembly are certainly to be pro—
tested, but uniformed private
armies are quite another thing.
The British government has
successfully suppressed such ac-
ti es m'thout endangering the
liberty of its peaceful and un-

menacing imitormed groups, It
is not too early for us to start
thinking about similar action,

The other incident was the re
cent cancellation of a South
American cruise on a German
owned liner by two prominent
American women. This was ubvi»
oiisly a protest against the Nazi
regime. However, it is one thing
to protest the action of a govern-
ment, and another thing to con»
tlemn the private citizens of that
country for the conduct of their
government. it was similar treat-
ment of the Germans after the
World War which eventually led
to the triumph at National So-
ciaiism.

Admittedly it is difiiculr. to

treat the German people im-
partially uhen such outrages
are perioi-med 1‘ their official
representatives. Yet we cannot
rightly blame the peoplei We
cannot hold the in'emgc Gare

or oi a steamship company. re.
sponsible for Hitler's policies.
We forced them into epting
him, and itow certaini should
not make them answer toi-
shortcomings, or ioi- our
tense feeling against him.

These two incidents serve to
illostratc on the one hand the
pcrhaps too tolerant attitude tak-
en toward the Nazi agitators by
the governing forces in this coun-
try, and on the other hand the
tendency to blame the German
people for tile actions of the Nazi
regime. In days like those, it
will certainly pay us to think
twice, or even three times, before
condoning or condemning the pol-
icy of any individual or group or
government.

volunteered to donate, personally,
a share of the cost of sending a

The Council decided against a

Mrs. George A. Clark, associate
in public relations, however,
pointed out that students should

chapel, but that there should be
a stioiiger drawing point from
within the chapel programs them-
selves.

According to Phelps, the fault
may lie with the type of programs
outlined by the chapel committee,
