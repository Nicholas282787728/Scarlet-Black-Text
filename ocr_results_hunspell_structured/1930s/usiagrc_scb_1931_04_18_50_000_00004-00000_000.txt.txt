WE NOMINATE
FOR the “hall of fame"
these lovely dresses at
SPURGEON'S. You may
have enough dressy clothes,
but I wager your school
clothes could stand an audio
tioh or two. They have the
darlingest blue prints, and
delicate shades of pink make
up into beautiful hand made
frocks. And I saw too, this
new eyelet cloth made into a
smart dress for only $8.75.
Honest, we're giving you a
real tip.
