Fourteen men and a girl: This
situation, practically unheard of
on the Grinnell campus (of alleg-
ed social-problem fame), will oc-
cur next Saturday night when the
local chapter of the Young Men's
christian association presents the

coiningrout party.

Glamour Girl.

Who is Grinnell's Glamour
girl? Who is Gl‘mnell's gift to
cafe society? That's what the ‘r'
wants to know. In fact the
it gentlemen i-search-of-a-lady
are now combing the campus for
a femme worthy of a debut as
spectacular as that with which
New York’s M—uncles-and-tt—bzti‘ge~
captain’sedaughter startled sas-
siety last Christmas.

Practically all of crinnelrs mas-
culine population is being enlists
ed in the search, letters request-
ing the nomination of a deb have
mg been sent to six of the most
influential men's organizations on
the campus. From the six candi-
dates advanced, the ‘Y’ uncles will
choose one to he presented at a
debut.

Blom‘le or Brunette.

Will she be blonde or brunette,
prep or senior, short or tall? The
world awaits the answer of Grin-
nell men.

tween the library and the ARH—
