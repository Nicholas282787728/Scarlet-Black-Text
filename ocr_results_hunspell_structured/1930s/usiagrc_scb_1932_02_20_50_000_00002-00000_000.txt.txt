Actuall} only a small part of the student body
will actively participate ill this conference, but.
if properly conducted. the meeting ,will have the
moral backing of nearly 100 per cent of the college
men and women. It is not all injustice, however, to
expert those planning the program to arrange a
conference which will consider the peace problem
for its various aspects.

It has not yet been proven that. disarmament
can be reached throughout the world or that it is
the best means of Securing perpetual peace ziny
men who do not favor complete disarmament are
trying to secure world peace. Some of these are
thoughtful persons he have logical arguments to
back up their assertions and opinions.

The peace conference here would do well to
include at least one such mall on 1he program. The
diet of speeches need not he so ovcrhzllzlnced that it

ELIMINATE USELESS CLASS OFFICES

(From the Dnily Trojan)

By appointing a committee to investigate class
offices, the legislative council has initiated a movement
which may result in a reduction in the number of chair-
warmers at the university.

For months the Daily Trojan has maintained, edi-
torially, that there should be a change in the policy of
having so many class officers that student government
becomes a form of bureaucracy. This degenerate con»
dition of surplus offices characterizes particularly the
Colleges of Commerce and Letters, Arts, and Sciences.

In national governments, a superabundance of of-
fices bespeaks an unhealthy and inefficient governing
body. Too many meaningless offices in student govern-
ment likewise signifies too much duplication and diluted
responsiblilty. officials stumble over one another in
their efforts to avoid work.

The password for most student officeholders is
“Pass the buck.”

That a large number of the class offices is unessen-
tial for good government is indicated by the lack of i -
terest shown at elections of the commerce and L. A. 3.
groups. Usually only one candidate is chosen for each
position, and the amazingly small vote shows the lack
of interest of the students themselves.

it president of each class in each college or school
would be fully able to take care of the small duties that
exist. In fact, the necessity of even a president can be
questioned. Too large a number of offices are merely
political plums that fall to students of uncertain capaci-
ties who are chosen usually because of their affiliations
and who want either the activity points or the small
honor achieved by winning over the other candidate.

Only those offices actually needed should sul-viv ;
those maintained just to satisfy the vanity of certain
students should be abolished,

We hope the investigating committee will make a.
true sifting, and submit an illuminating report to the
council.

TRANSFORMATIONS
(From the [own Wesleyan News)

It’s the sad, sad truth that hurts and grades are
no exception to,that rule. Grades are once more issued
and the campus has settled to a. forlorn daze, some of
the students cursing the unfairness of a system that
gave them failing grades, others bewildered over un-
deservedly high grades. Friends of yesterday are no
more, after the intense rivalry of last semester has
ended. Biting remarks are flowing unrestrainedly from
the lips of supposedly innocent and gentle society buds.
Former honorable gentlemen are now transformed into
raving maniacs, waiting on dark comers for a professor
to pass by.

One disgusting and disheartening thing about the
curve system is that it really shows us what the pro-
fessor thinks of ollr work. Instead of the sugar coated
A’s and 13': of yesterday we are faced with a. stern
array of D's and F's. Give us lthe good old days, when
professors were not faced with the difficult task of
removing a student violently from his class or in classes
where everyone was of equal ability the professor did
not have to choose certain members to draw fltlnlls
while others received A's and B's to maintain Lhe aver-
age. .

Perhaps next semester the student body will know
more of what is expected of them and will attempt
to live up to these expectations. Perhaps next semester
an abundance of cribbing will feature the classes and
examinations. Placed in competition with one another in
a school as small as Wesleyan the students might feel
that if they don't possess certain note to help them
remember examination facts, their competitors might
take this method and secure higher grades. This lowers
their respect for their opponents as the other students
might be appropriately named, but at the same time
adds to their own desire to obtain grades, by fair means
or foul. The curve system is new at Wesleyan and may
improve with age. if it is here to stay students as well
as professors may soon adjust themselves to it.

Nalice

Much care llns been taken to
prevent the spread of the “colds"
which have put several students on
the sick list. This ailment is con-
tagious, and patients shoulrl be
rig-idly isolated from the first ori-
set of the infection. With eoeope
eratlon of the well and the sick,
the thing can be kept down to a
minimum.

Patients in the quadrangle, dor-
mitories, or hospital must not be
visited Without permission of the
medical officer in charge. Protect
yourself and the community. The
sick will get bettcr care if there
are fewer of them.

Editor,

' The Scarlet and Black.

Grinnell, Iowa
Dear Sir:

When I was a member of The
Scarlet and Black staff years ago ac-
curacy was one of the requirements.
Yesieven in the editorials. Referring
to the editorial in the issue of Feb.
17 "censured" may I, zts a member
of the executive committee of Focht»
Tennant post, American Legion,
make this statement.

We protested the address of Mr.
Libby as part of the thhlngton bi—
centennial celebration for several
reasons, principally because both the
speaker and his subject were far re-
moved from the name of George
Washington and in addition because
Mr. Libby ms put on the program
for the presentation of propaganda
and the promotion of a selfish cause.
The protest was merely against his
appearing on the program and not a
“censorship" of any appearance of his
in Grinnell. Since these are the facts
and were not so presented may I hope

As to the reference to the Legion
being “narrow in its tolerance”, I
merely State that there are plenty of]
men on the Grinnell college faculty
who, like Prof. J. W. Galinnwny, are
really well qualified to speak on
George Washington and will really
add something worth while to the
program.

Frederick L. Baumann, associate
professor of history, wrll discuss the
life and ideals of George Washington
at chapel Monday morning as a part

brated by the community of Grinnell
