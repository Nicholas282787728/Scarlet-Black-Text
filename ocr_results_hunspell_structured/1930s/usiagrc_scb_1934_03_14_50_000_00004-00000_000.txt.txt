Poloists Enter

Three-Way Tie

Clark Wins Second Match
to Rank With Leaders.

Clark moved into a tie for first
place in the intramural water polo
standings last night by downing Dibv
hle in a goaliess battle 4 to 3. Super-
ior ability from the free throw line
enabled the winners to obtain their
one»point margin of victory.

“Cub" Baer had a perfect record of
four points on four gratis tosses to
score all of Clark's total. A toss by
Baer in the deep‘ end of the pool near
the close of the game provided the de‘
ciding point,

nibble Misses Three

Although the Dibble team exhibited
the stronger offense of the two, it
was unable to conclude any of its
goal drives with a score. The north—
enders, though awarded three free at-
tempts during the first half, went
scoreless until well into the final par
riod,

Nyganrd scored for Dibble on a free
throw near the middle of the last
stanza, but Beer soon retaliated to
bring the score to 4-1. With little
more then a minute to play Meyers
added two more points to the Dibble
total, but the northend outfit was uns
able to pick up the tying point dur-
ing the few seconds that remained.

Conard Explains
New Examinations

(Continued from page ll

Harvard Alumni bulletin:

“Some Americans interested in ed-

ucation have, in the past, looked upon
an examination rather as a means of
detecting and punishing neglect of
work: or at best of testing knowledge
of facts alone, or as a measure of
undigested content.

“In their minds it has been like an
indictment, not to be applied to per-
sons who had given no cause for trial.
They did not appreciate the educa-
tional function of examination, both
in setting a standard and as an exer-
cise in recalling and coordinating
knowledge.

"A good paper in a general examir
nation should he one for which review
of facts alone is of little value. It
should call for a comprehension. a
grasp, of the subject which cannot he
acquired quickly, and which when
obtained needs little refreshment."
