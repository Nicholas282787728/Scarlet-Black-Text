Trade Expansion
Seen Possible in
South America

By William c. Harris.—

Lcst in last week’s war news
was a blurb concerning a proh-
1em which is more important to
Uncle Sam than all the rusty
American freighters in or out of
Nazi hands.

And that little item 11.n-
nounced the opening of public
hearings upon the proposed Ar-
gentina trade pact with the
United States. Having complet—
od agreements with sevomi
South and Central American
countries, including Brazil, oo—
lumbia, Nimagua, and Econ-
(10:, the state department is
now launching negotiations
with our other neighbors to the
south.

Already, Yankee capitalists are
greedily eyeing the South Amer—
ican markets recently vacated by
the warring European powers.
And with good reason: normally
exporting only $250,000,000 worth
of stuff to these countries, the
United States Will now get a
crack at the German, British. 1nd
French slices of the pie which
lasf. year totalled Close to $500.-
000,000.

. During the last World Wary

United states exports rose

lrom $500,000,000 in 1013 to

over 11/, billion dollars In
goods in 1920. And imports
from the South American nar-
tIons climbed to nearly zhiuion

dollars worth by 1920 from a
preelvar level oi less than$840r

000,000.

And now this country's entre-
preneurs scent a trade boom to
the tune of one billion smackers.

All of which isn't going to do
White-halted Mr. Hull‘s plan
for intro-American trade any
harlnl Ever slime he stuck his
knets under the state depart—
ment desk, the former Tennes-
see judge has followed a trade
policy looking toward the day
when our commerce with our
sister republics 1Vill reach an
annual figure or one billion dol—

Ian‘s.

Developing the first phase of
this idea was not hard. Trade
agreements were concluded with
those South American countries
whose economies were
mentary to ours with relative
ease. But the rub is coming
now in attempting to arrive at
workable arrangements with such
nations as Venezuela, Uruguay,
and Argentina.

Unlike Brazil, which can fur-
nish us with coilee in return
1or automobiles and radios,
these countries main exports
are those goods which are pro—

comple-'

Unitul
ArgEns

llucell here in the
States. For example,

t|n:l, whose products are the lbIg-“llg New Deniers

most like those of the United
States, has only one out of 25
main exports acceptable to this
country—an extract used

of life than all of the mouthy,
amateur statesmanship of other
Combined.
Mn Hull's will not he an easy
row to hoe, and he may even fall
short of complete success. But

in [one accomplishment will be can

dyes. And Uruguayan wool and 'tain: he has pointed in the right

canned meats and Venezuelan
oil and hides are no better oil.

Ditto ior Cuban sugar.

But the effort is being made,
thanks to the vision of Cor-dcll
Hull. Just about the only states-
man in the prescnt administra»
tion, Mr. Hull is doing more for
democracy and the American way

direction.

TOWN MEN TO MEET.

The town men will meet Sunday
evening in the white House, ac-

cording to Kenneth Sage, nresi-1
dent of the group. Refreshments‘

and entertainment are planned.
