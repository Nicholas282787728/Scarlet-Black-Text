Council Allol‘s
Semesier Fee

Revises Old Division
To Include Money
For Band Uniforms

The allocation of the semester fee
for 193940 as drawn up by the
Student Council was passed by
the faculty as a whole in June.

The division of the fee was re-
vised from last year’s allocation
to give the band an added income
to use for purchasing new uni-
forms, Wi iam Pedersen, presi-
dent of the council, declared.

The allotment is as follows:
athletics, 53 percent; tennis, .75
percent; golf, .75 percent; swim-
ming, a percent; band (running
expenses), 2.50 percent; band
(new uniforms), 4 percent; music.
17.75 percent; lectures, 8 percent;
International Relations, 250 per-
cent; drama, 2 percent; student
Council. 2.50 percent debate
(men's). .50 percent; debate
(women's), 50 percent; and Warm
en's Athletic association, 1.75 per-
cent.

“We have tried," Pedersen star
ted, "to take into consideration
the interests of the students, both
men and women."

The Student Council's share of
the money was raised one percent
this year to take care of operat-
ing the White House, student res
creational center.

According to Pedersen, the al-
lotments to the drama depart
ment and men's and women’s de-
bate may be subject to certain
changes next {alli

Lightning Bugs
Glow West in
Pioneer Spirit

Some students wait until they are
out of college to begin their 507
cial service work, but not Mary
Ellen Applehy, sophomore student
from Chevy Chase. Md., according
to a United Press radio bulletin
heard here Thursday morning.

It seems that the residents of
Seattle, Wash, and the surround-
ing territory had never seen light-
ning bugs due to the fact that the
insects are not found west of the
Rocky mountains, but thanks to
Miss Appleby they saw the bugs
for the first time.

Miss ,Appleby felt sorry for the
residents and asked her father if
something couldn't be done about
it. something was done about it
and a shipment of 500 lightning
bugs was sent to Seattle to be
viewed in wonder and amazement
by a crowd gathered in the city
park. Bands played and people
cheered as the lights were turned
off and the insects glowed forth
under a glass cage,

And again, as always before,
the Pioneer spirit of a Grinnelli—
an is first. First to see that light-
ning bugs are distributed to difr
ferent parts of the country.

EACH TO THE OTHER

By Clindoplm La Fdi'gc
Poetry is a fine thingibllt it
should not he encouraged, The
blessed thing about it is that it
wul say what it wants to say:
will take care of itself; cannot die
so long as there are those who
know life, per se, is not enough
and who have thc energy and
vision and genius to create that
which they. of all other men, have
been able to knowiwnl, llke
death, “come when it will come,”
There is, then, no reason why we
should fall upon ecstatic knees
before a mass of poetry simply
because it happens to be some-
thingthing comparatively rare and
ambitious and nicely doneisomee
thing comparatively rare and
novel in verse. Let us, then, dis-
pense with the awe and wonder
and respect - tactile — saturation -
pnint niat accompany our reading
of Christopher La Fal‘ge’s “Each
to the other,“ and decide what

agriculture, publication,
and women's or-

cation,
law, medicine,
ganizations. , ,
The Congress, which will be
organized into several groups.
will discuss the relation of the
public to the educational insti-
tutions of the country.
Delegates from three foreign
countries, France. Great Britain,
and Sweden, will attend the con-
clave, which will be addressed by
such speakers as Earl Baldwin.
former Prime Minister of Creat‘
Britain, Gunner Myrdai of the,
University of Stockholm, and‘
Eduard Herriot, president of the‘
French Chamber of Deputies.

it is, really, that we have here.

“Each to the other," the jacket
of the book informs us, is a
novel in verse.” Its main con»
corn is to demonstrate the factors
that may contribute to a deeply
successful marriage. The form is
an episodic autobiography of
Thomas Cottrcll. The incidents of
his life until marriage have been
calculated to dispose him strong-
ly against mairiagc; but, Ialling
completely in love with Judith
Carpenmr, he marries her. The
subsequent episodes deal with
their married career over fifteen
years, from many angles; and the
poem concludes after Tom and
Judith have achieved strength of
unity inherent in a marriage slice
‘cessflll because they have made
ll: so. The incidents, illustrated
by some thirty characters in Sev»
eiity-‘five episodes, range from
childhood through day by day
experiences, and include madness,
the war and murder. The scene
is laid in Rhode Island, New
York, and Europe.”

My principal objection to this
book is that the characters do
not merge; they are neither con-
vincing nor believable; they do not
possibly have meaning or reality
outside the mind of the author
himself. This is, after all, a
novel, and as such it should
have living, breathing people in
it. And yet in spite of the whise
kies tossed off, the mistresses
enjoyed, and the babies born, the
characters remain strange, fan-
tastic, aloof, moving about in a
sort of stillerl poetic frenzy, but
always in the best of taste.

What people who really want
to serve poetry as it should be
servediwith strong respect, tear,
energy, craftmanship, and lovei

{ should ever hear in mind is what

Conrad said about the artist, who
must ”Speak . . . . to the subtle
but invincible conviction of solids
arity that knits together the lone-
liness of innumerable hearts, to
the solidarity in dreams, in joy,
in sorrow, in aspirations, in illu-
sions, in hope, in fear, which binds
men to each other, which binds
together all humanitygthe dead
to the living and the living to the
unbum."

The failure of “Each to the
Other" lies, I think. in its refusal
to speak except to itself.
