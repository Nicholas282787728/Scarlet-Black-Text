. . . . Oll HOLD OUR PEACE

Before and since the Brooklyn Conference
there has been student opinion voiced coll-
cerning the value of that conference.

Criticism has ranged from the belief
that student “leaders” are having a “week-
end party” to the idea that “maybe some-

ithing was accomplished but no one ever
hears about it”

There are several facts which should be
taken into consideration before such criti-
cism is made. The student government is
absolutely sincere in its attempts to better
conditions which fall within its scope. The
members of the Brooklyn Conference sacrie
ficed time and expended energy to further
that attempt. Their ideas were drawn up
into recommendations to be presented to the
proper authorities for action. Those recom-
mendations are being publicized as adee
quately as possible

At present, the publicizing of these re—
commendations is being made at chapel but
attendance is small. Here is the situation:
a government, interested in creating a ”bet-
ter Grinnell for the Grinnell student", is
presenting its ideas for improvement and is
asking for student criticism and additions

But there is 120 student response!

We as students must either go to these
“Brooklyn" chapel periods and get in the
harness with the student government, or
else when the student government proceeds
as best it can without our co-operation,
which it earnestly requests, we must hold
our peace!

PASS THE BUCK

Editor's note: It is not without some misgivings
that. we venture to hold n post mortem over the
Grlnncll football-school spirit situation. But in an
elfort to (To our hit to prevent a repeat perform-
ance of the 1939 grid season, we feel that some
comments are justified.

Last year Grillllell played its last season in
the Missouri Valley conference. We were
told to look forward to a bright year in the
Midwest loop among schools of equal size,
This year We barely stayed out of the con-
ference cellar, tying for second to last place.
Can it be that we are goillg to play a few
seasons in the Midwest and then drop dowll
into the Iowa conference, or perhaps we
should look forward to the advent of six-
man football at Gi‘innell.

We have read in the local newspaper that
the blame for Grinncll's poor season must
be laid to the poor training procedure ob—
served by the squad members; we’ve been
informed by the coach that the poor spirit
of the student body has had much to do with

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the poor showing; members of the team
have blamed the coaching; other team mem-
bers have blamed the rest of the team; and
we have had a 101 different reasons for this
season’s failures from the students, faculty.
and alumni.

We won’t presume to say which reasons
are right, but we do maintain that some
actions should be taken to clear the decks
for a better season next year:

(1) School Spirit—It occurs to lls that
the Student Council might perform a valu-
able service on this campus by examining the
situation, for it seems that here is some
thing which might prove the ability of that
body to investigate a really vital issue

(2) Cooclti‘itg'—We suggest that the '
clllty or perhaps the Student Council might
determine whether the coaching is to blame.

(3) Encotti'ugcmmltiltealizing that ath-
letics at Grinnell college are conducted upon
as strictly amateur basis as almost any col-
lege in the country, we nevertheless suggest
that our morality would suffer little and en-
thusiasm for varsity athletics would be in-
creased materially by a policy of “encourage
ing” high school athletes to enroll In Grill-
llell without actual subsidizing It seems
to us that in view of the present deficit ill
conducting athletics at Grinllell, enough
could be obtained as income, by having a
team that would attract paying customers,
to at least pay for sweeping out the stad—
iuln when the game is over.

That something should be done is obs
vious, but we feel that nothing will be done.
It has become a tradition ill the last few
years for Grinnellians to gripe and wistfully
hope that someone else will do a job that
should be doneu

VOCATIONAL TRAINING

Early to recognize the increasing importe
ance and position of vocational training ill
the school of today, Grinnell College has
attracted the notice of schools throughout
the country ill its vocational training pro—
gram. Commencing in the freshman year,
a ullit of the freshman orientation course is
devoted to the study and discussion of voca-
tional problems in general and is supple-
mented by a comprehensive library of voca-
tional literature.

The second step ill the program is froln
the general survey of vocational trends and
problems to the specific treatment of in-
dividual occupations, professions and indus-
tries.
01’ an annual series of weekly Vocational fol
unis held for the special benefit of seniors
and interested juniors and sophomores. Lead-
ing business and professional men and wo—
men are invited to the forums to conduct
panel discussions alld to confer with in—
dividual students. Fields covered by voca
tiollal forums ill 1938 were: teaching, 1)
sonnel Work, civil service, public adminis—
tration, chemistry and related sciences, joul
nalism, and social work. ,

Climaxing the program, job surveys are
held during spring vacation in Chicago, Des
Moillcs, and Minneapolis. Ill 1938, fiftyr
seven uppel'classmen took part in the sur
way, which was organized under the direc»
tion of the vocations committee, composed of
botll faculty and student members, and car
ried out with the cooperation of interested
Hlllllllill Utilizing their Contacts to open
doors to these students, the alumni have
made it possible for them to gaill invaluable
first-hand experience ill the techniques of
talking with prospective employers about
employment possibilities. Every year a
number of students receive tenders of em-
ployment, Those who are not fortunate
enough to receive such offers report that
they have received a great benefit from the
opportunity of testing in a practical way the,
ideas gained from their more theoretical,
study of employment ill different fields, and
the techniques of job discovery.

According to John W. Pooley, facility
chairman of the vocations committee, on all-
college convocation will be held soon to exe
plain ill detail to the student body recent
developments and future possibilities of the

Social Problems
Obvious to Quad
Waiters Monday

What was the most obvious thlng
on Monday? Not just Victory
Dayiwnat happened in the moi-n-
ing—and the night before?

The waiters and waitresses at
the quad will tell you if you don't
know. They were more than a. lit
tlc disgusted With the whole of-
fair. They haul visions of quit-
ting early anrl going back to
bed.

so—at 7:15 a. m.7\vhen 25
droopy damsels lagged into break-
fast, they were not greeted core
dially by tho waiters. In fact.
they were almost rude about it,
They tried blocking the door whcn
the James delegation got to the
{lining room first.

And when Cleveland strolled
in next, more groans went up
from the working crew. The final
stragglcrsia few from Haines
and Readididn't quite fill the
third tablc.

Quadrangle general opinion is
that 25 coerls didn't have it Sunr
day night and so want to berl.
Unconfirmed reports from the
dormitories support the belief
that 25 men also failed to solve
the social problem stinday night.
