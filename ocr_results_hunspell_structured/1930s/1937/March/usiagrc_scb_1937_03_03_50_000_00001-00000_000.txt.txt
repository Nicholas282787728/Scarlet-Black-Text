part in the Missouri ,Valley indoor
conference meet. at the Drake uni-
versity fieldhouse.

door half—mile run at the meet
last year, and Roger Nelson tied
for first in the pole vault. Schlot-
terbeck will probably not defend
his laurels this year, as he has
been shifted to the quarter-mile.

away with the meet, Coach Duke
said, “and the Oklahoma Aggies,
Washington university, and Grin-
ncll will battle it out for second.

Last year the Pioneers were
pushed out of second place by the
Aggies, missing that position by
one point.

Drake last week defeated Notre
Dame 54-45. Capt. Roger Nelson
of the Pioneers, co-holder of the
Valley indoor pole vault title, may
encounter unusually stiff competi-
tion from Addington of Drake,

lCo-eds to Aband n
Dance Program
for Lack of Date

Because no date was available
on the college calendar, the annual
women's intramural dancing con-
test will not be held this year, it
was decided by the Women's Ath-
letic association board at a special
meeting Sunday evening at the
apartment of Miss Clara Julia kn-
dersen, director of physical educa-
tion for women.

The contest, a traditional part of
the women’s athletic program, has
usually been held in die form of
competition between the various
cottages, with the winner getting
intramural points. Each cottage
presented a program carrying out
some particular theme.

Last year for the first time all
the cottages were not ranked, as
the judges decided only on the first
and second place winners. The con-
test last year was won by Read
cottage with a dance skit entitled
"A Raw Deal." Haines cottage
finished second with “Four Night
Club.”
