THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ucation for peace, Dr.
Tildsley, assistant superintendent
of New York City schools, ex
plained that certain predisposi-
tions must be overcome and post
tive attitudes created in their
place.

“I am not for peace at any
price as between nations or as be-
tween society and the humans who
are hostile to it. I believe there
have been times and that there
will be times again when the axe
istence or a nation can be main-
taiiied only by armed resistance,
but I also believe that such times
must become ever rarer if the race
is to survive.

”I would not make a pacifist, in
the extreme sense, of the youth in
the school. 1 would not have him
subscribe to the Oxford oath or
even have him believe with some
of my Quaker friends, whom I so
greatly respect, that there can be
no possible circumstances which
will justify armed resistance," said
Dr. Tildsley.

Preliminary plans for the Brown

With no kingdom to offer for a

Psychiatrist Believes
Ambition Causes Ills

Patronizc S. 8; B. advertisers.

Berkeley, Cali (ACP)—Am-
bition causes much of the physical
illness in this country. declared
Dr. Amy Stannard, University of
California psychiatrist in agree—
ment with a statement recently
issued by D)’. Porter Vinson of the
Medical college of Virginia

The desire to better one's lot,
the Virginia doctor had originally
stated, causes a worker to strive
in an atmosphere of speed and
harassment until he is nervously
exhausted and ruined for happie
ncss he might ﬁnd in his own
sphere.

”This does not prove, however,
that ambition is unhealthy in it-
self,” Dr. starinard asserted. “I
am certain that Dr. Vinson does
not imply that one should not have
any ambition. What he Elna mean
is that an individual’s ambition
should be aimed at a reasonably
attainable goal rather than at a
goal adopted from someone else's
ideas of what he should be."
