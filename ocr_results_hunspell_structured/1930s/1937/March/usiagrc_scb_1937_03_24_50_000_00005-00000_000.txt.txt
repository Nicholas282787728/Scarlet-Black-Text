four, fourth in five, and fifth in
five events. The Pioneers. in ad-
dition to their five first places

Three Records Broken

Three meet records were shat-

of them were set in Friday night's
preliminaries. Bill Kiessling lows
ered the former 150-yard back-
stroke record held by Malbrough

Rudy Brand of Washington clip-
ped a full second off the time of
the zoo-yard hreastroke, lowering
it from 2:43 to 2. 2.3. The
third record set was in the 3007

According to John Truesdale,
athletic director at Grinnell, the
Washington coach has sent him a
letter in which he states that the
Grinnell swimmers had handed
his boys the first real scare they
had received at the valley meet
in a number of years

Y.W.C.A. Director
Discusses Methods
of Interviewing

The fundamentals of conducting
oneself during an interview were
discussed by Miss Esther stamatz
Monday evening before the stue
dents who are to make the Chica-
go Job hunt. Miss stamatz is
with the service bureau of the
Chicago Young Womens' Christian
association.

She suggested three important
points to remember when you are
being interviewed: know what you
are going to say before going to
the interview: be specific, know
exactly what you want to do;
know the advantages and disad-
vantages of the job you are ap-

plying for and know all you can
about the firm,

Miss .Stematz believes that at
titudes and appearance of an ID'
dividual are even more important
than a knowledge of the Job.

Tuition, Costs

to Remain Same
for 1937-38

College tuition and costs for the
year 1937733 will remain the some
as this year, according to the list
of expenses in the new catalogue,
iwhich will be ready for distribu-
tion about April 1.

“A general charge of 5680, pay-
able in two semester installments
of $340 each, covers the expense
of a year at Grinnell," the state-
ment reads. Contrary to rumors
which have been spreading on the
campus. this is no increase. The
announcement is followed by the
usual fact that the college reserves
the right to increase or decrease
board rates, with due notice, de-
pending upon economic conditions.

An added feature of this year's
catalogue is a history of the col-
lege, accompanied by a chronologi-
cal table of events. The cover
design, photographs of the stone
carving which decorates Alumni
Recitation hall, is the same as last
year‘s, and in other respects the
issue is substantially the same.
