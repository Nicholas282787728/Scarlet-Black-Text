' Leslie Howard

says Luckies are "tops” with
his throat

"Years ago, as an ambitious young
actor, I was impressed how well my
throat liked Luckies and how well
they suited my idea of a perfect
cigarette. That impression still
stands.Inmyrecenttourof‘Hnmlet’,

with its many

performances each

week and the attendant tax on my
throat, I have been convinced anew
that this light smoke is both delight-

ful to my taste

and the ‘tap’ cigar

rette for an actor’s throat.”

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

Mr. Howard veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro—
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain

harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
“It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
