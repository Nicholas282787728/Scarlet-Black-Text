Cagers Lose

Pioneers Play Carleton

Tonight in Final
Non-Loop Tilt

Hampered by the beating ad-
ministered to them by the high-
flying Bluejays Wednesday, and
weakened by the loss of Jim La-
Masney, co-captnin and forward,
nine Grinnell cagers left last night
for Northfield, Minn, to engage
the powerful Carleton five tonight
in the final non—conference game
of the year for the Pioneers.

Coach John C. Truesdale indi-
cated last night that the sudden
loss of LaMasney would altar his
starting lineup, and said that he
would start the following five
against the Carla: forwards, Hay-
ward and Robinson; center, Luick;
guards, Dean and Berry.

Others on Trip

Those making the trip in addi-
tion to the starting five are: Har-
old High, forwar , Vernon Cor-
nish, center; Bill Conwill and Bill
Fowler, guards.v

Although Carleton has won only
three out of six games so far this
season, the Pioneer mentor antici-
pates a hard battle, mainly be-
cause of the strong "\vin—on-the-
home-ﬂoor" tradition which the
Carls have developed Grinnell will
be further handicapped by the
physical beating suffered at the
hands of Creighton Wednesday.

Meet Drake Tuesday

Faced vvith the task of meeting
the powerful, although oft defeate
ed Drake Bulldogs next Tuesday
night, Coach Truesdale revealed
yesterday that he considered the
Carleton tilt a welcome chance to
polish the Grinnell offensive and
defensive tactics.

The Pioneers may enter the
Drake game in the ancient men's
gymnasium Tuesday night slight

Pioneer hopes for victory
over Drake Tuesday night, tem-
porarily reduced Friday when
Jim LaMasney, cmcaptain and
forward, was ordered not to
play against Carleton tonight,
were revived today when it was
learned that his ankle injury
was not as serious as first be-
lieved.

LaMasney injured his right
ankle in the Creighton game
Wednesday night. and the pre-
liminary diagnosis indicated a
serious injury, but an x-i'ay
taken Friday at the hospital
showed the ankle to he hruised
instead of chipped or fractured.

The attending physician an
nounced today that the Pioneer
cmcaptain would be ready to
play against the Drake Bill!—
dogs here Tuesday night.

Duke Believes
Cinder Squad Has
Two Weaknesses

Track Coach G, Lester Duke
iiamcd the quarter mile and high
jump as the two events is which
the 1937 Pioneer track team would
be weakest, as he sent his men
through linihcring up exercises
this week in preparation for the
opening of the indoor season on
Feb. 26 with the dual contest with
the Uni‘ sity of Iowa.

“We will be much weaker in the
quarter mile this year and as yet
I haven‘t found anyone who looks
like a high jumper," he declared
yesterday ”I believe that we will
be stronger than last year in the
middle distance and distance
events, but I am not sure about
the dash men and the hurdlers,
although there are plenty of men
reporting for these events," he
continued.

Cnlisthenics and several laps of
running featured the first week
of conditioning. The trackmcn
will begn'n training on their special
events the first of next week, ac-
cording to Coach Duke.
