Professors Develop Different Means
of Preventing ‘Cribbing’ in Exams

Majority Find Cheating
No Serious Problem;
Many Tricks Used

“cribbing” in examinations at
Grinnell is negligible, according to
professors, although everyone is
willing to admit that he may not
know the whole story But in a
series of interviews with repre-
sentative professors, not one was
found who had serious trouble
with students cheating.

Joseph W. Charlton, associate
professor of economics, stated the
general faculty opinion when he
said, “I prefer to believe that
students are honest. I hate to
stand over them with a club."

Ridiculcs idea

“I try to make cribbing seem
ridiculous by telling my students
that they‘ll get cross-eyed if they
look at each other’s papers,” said
George 0. Seiver, assistant pro-

- fessor of French. After two warn-
ings, a student suspected of cheat-
ing is sent out of his examination
room without further ado. Mr.
Seiver believes that the best
method of preventing dishonesty is
to make out examinations of the
type which must be answered from
a student's total knowledge rather
than from crib notes.

Mrs. Blanche 5, Leonard, in-
structor in education, declared that
she has no difficulty with crib-
hing, because her classes are com-
paratively small. “cribbing” seems
unprofessional in my type of work,
anyway," she said.

Prefer Honor System

The honor system, in which the
professor asks each student to sign
a statement at the end of the
exam. that he has neither given
nor received aid, is preferred by
several professors. One of these
is Leigh 0. Douglass, assistant
professor of psychology, who nev-
er remains in the room when ade
vanced students are taking exami»
nations.

“If they cheat now, they'll do
it all through life, and 1 see no
reason why I should place them
under conditions different from
those they will meet later," he
said. “After all, college students
are supposed to be men and wom-
en,.not children.”

Taught How to study

Frederick L. Baumanh, associate
professor of hisbory, told a story
of a boy he knew in another
school, who passed an exam with
a high grade, almough he had
been doing poor work. Mr. Bau-
mann congratulated him on it
some time later, and the boy fi-
nally came to him and confessed
that he had cheated in the test.

“But do you know,” he said, “I
boiled down that course to the
bare essentials, and wrote signifi-
cant phrases on my cuff, and in
doing that, I,rea.'lly learned how to
study!"

Many Schemes

Writing answers on bare legs,
on tape strapped to the ankle, on
adding-machine paper rolled
around pencil stubs, and all the
other time-honored methods of
cribbing are characterized as
“dumb" by Henry s. Conard, pro~
fessor of botany.

“It’s a form of stealing from
your fellow students," he declared.
“What irritates me is that Stu»
dents become angry when profes-
sors take measures to prevent it.

Have Had No Trouble

Carl Niemeyer, instructor in
English, and Carl c. Johnson, in-
structor in drama, have had no
trouble with students cheating in
exams. Mr. Niemcyer says that
he would report the matter to the
student‘s dean, and fail him in
the course, Mr. Johnson would
wait until the exam was over, and
discuss the matter privately with
the culprit,

“I have too much respect for

students’ feeling to make a scene

l

in class," he stated ,
Many Anecdotes

Anecdotes or all kinds came out
in the interviews. Mr. Niemeyer,
told of a student who took an‘
English mechanics exam in place‘
of another. The substitution was
finally detected through the dif-
ference in handwriting,

Mrs, Leonard described the great
amount of dishonesty which went
on in classes in Paris and Gren-
oble, France. An Italian woman..
she said, hecamc indignant when
another student would not let hei-
see her paper. “In my country,"
she declared, “one friend will do
anything for another.

One of Mr. Niemeyer's best
stories had to do with a business
administration major who was sus-
pected of cheating in a compre:
hensive examination. It finally
turned out that the student had
memorized her material, word for
word, and was prepared to quote
it to prove that she had not been
dishonest.
