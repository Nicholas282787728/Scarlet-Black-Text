'37 Grads Wan’r
Travel, Hear
Swing Bands

(ACP)The 1937 college gradu.
ate‘s life ambitions are: (a) world
travel. (b) listening to swing
hand. according to a survey made
by Bruce Bliven Jr, son of the
author.

From interviewing tellow grad-
uates from coast to coast he gath-l
ered the impression that they be.
have in working as little as pose:
sible, getting paid as much as pos
sihlc, retiring as early as possible
and spending the rest of theirl
lives listening to Benny Goodman’s
records and traveling around thei
world.

For the beneiit of the blood
pressure of those who fear the
“Red Menace" on college campus»
es, Bllven found his interviewees
wele (1) not radicals, liberals or
progressives, (2) not Communists
or Fascists, (3) were. instead,
conservative. critical and hard-
headed.

to Open Swing Club

The Hal Hardin nine-piece 01's
chestra, including eight college
students, will open the fall ses-
sion ot the Swing Club Friday
evening when they have sched-
uled a dance beginning at 3:15
