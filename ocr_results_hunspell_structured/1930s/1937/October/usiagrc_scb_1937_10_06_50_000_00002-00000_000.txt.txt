by his play against the Teachers.

It is a little difficult to specu»
late about the strength of the
Bluejays. Before their defeat by
Oklahoma Ags, praise rang loud
and clear about the powerful
Creighton outfit, but opinions
have changed a bit since Okla-
homa upset them, But this much
should he said: it is probable that
Oklahoma pulled their upset with
an inferior team spurred on by
some other force than pure tech-
nical ability.

The Creighton team will he b01~
stered by a squad of 22 lettermen,
and some fine sophomore inater-
ial, which gives them plenty of
reserve strength. They are
blessed by weight and favored by
speed. Thus far they have based
their attack on running plays,
but they have a fairly good pass
ing attack which they can rely
on. The balance of the game
rests on whether their superior
reserve strength and powerful
running attack can be met by
Pioneer spirit and an effective
passing attack.
