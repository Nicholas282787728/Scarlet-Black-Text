Oklahoma A&M shot to the top
in the conference race this week
and in doing so plummeted
Creighton to share the cellar with
Washington university as the Ags
turned in a sur-pri ng 16—13 win
over the Jays. Friday, completely
baffling the experts, who had, to
be sure, picked the Ags as a dark
horse, but had envisioned a bright
future this year for Creighton.
The Ags now share first place
with Drah ,_winner week before
last over Washington.

Another major conference sur-
prise this week was Grinnell-s as—
tounding reversal of form against
Iowa State Teachers college, a
powerful outfit slated to win. The
Pioneers flashed a snappy passing
attack which earned them a 20-20
tie with the Tutors, and which
might just as easily haveearned
them a victory,

Conference casualities this week
were Drake, who bowed to 55 so.
perior Notre Dame players, 21-0,
and Washburn, defeated by Ken-
sas university, 25-2. In other
games, St. Louis U. coasted over
Missouri Mines by a 32-6 score;
Tulsa defeated Central Teachers
42 to 6; and Washington, recover.
ed from their heating by Drake,
vented their splecn on William
Jewell, 45 to 0. ‘

Only two conference games are
booked for this week end, as Grin—
nell travels to Creighton and
Washburn goes to Oxford to meet
Mississippi, Tulsa takes on chas
Christian at Fort Worth. and

A. Time would have it, kudos
this week to;

Coach Guy Lookztlmugll: For
givrng Pioneer fans last Friday a
team which looked well coached
and more thoroughly versed in
fundamentals and preci on of
play than Grinnell teams for many
a moon.

Fred HDnlannZ For being the
spearhead and driving force in
that Crinnell attack. For a mighty
fine exhibition of passing and
kicking.

The Men Who Blocked for the
Passer: For blocking so effective.
ly that the passer in most instance
es had plenty of time to get his
throws off, which accounted in
large part for the completion of
so many passes.

Trio Grlinncll Team: For revi-
ving suddenly after the Cornell
game and giving an excellent ex-
hibition of football. For going out
and really blocking and tackling.

oildrnents: Conference teams
are really exerting themselves
these days to get games out of
their class. Witness Washington's
games last year against Notre
Dame and Illinois, Drake's Notre
Dame game this year. On top of
that Tulsa will meet Texas Chris-
tian university next week and
Washington will take on Southern
Methodist. They should have a
busy week. Wonder what the Iowa
state Teachers scout who sat in

' the prcss box at the Cornell game

here thinks now? He didn't seem
impressed at the time.

And there should be some need-
aches at Creighton this week.
There was so much talk before
and after the Jays beat st. Bene-
diet that Creighton was far on top
this year. But some are inclined
to look on the St. Benedict win as
a fluke, It must be admitted that
Drake performed creditably Sat.
urday. .'

Itimior is flying around that
Ralph West, who played substitute
guard for the Pioneers last year,
will return to Grinnell in a few
days, He is now enrolled in Okla-
homa university, but wants to
change. His addition to the foot-
ball squad, if he does come back,
will mean a possibility that one
guard might be shifted to tackle
in order to furnish more reserve
strength at that post. All conjeCA
ture, however.

Says Mr. Grinnelllan:

this:
