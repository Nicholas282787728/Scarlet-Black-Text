Two Schools
Clash in 44’rh
Game Friday

|Bulldogs, with Only One
I Defeat, Favored in
Conference Contest

By Wells H. Barnett

“Beat Drake 1" is the watchword
in the Pioneer camp this week,

The two schools will meet in
Des Moines Friday night in the
forty-fourth renewal or that his-
toric rivalry, and it is a Hercule-
an task the Pioneers have taken
unto themselves to perform.

Drake Defeated Once

The Bulldogs have been beaten
only once tius year, and it took
Notre Dame to do it, They envel-
oped Washington in touchdowns,
they smothered Washburn, and
breezed through Creighton. They
have a mighty running: attack led
by the redoubtable Manders
brothers, and a powerful passing
attack to fall back on.

But you never can tell about a
Drake-Grinnell game. and the hi
tory of the series proves it. This
year, for the first time in some
years, Grinnell will come up with
a potent team which is improv- '
iiig every weeltendia team which
knows how to block and tackle
and is not afraid to use its knowl-
edge—a team which will play ball
until the last gun. it will be a
game worth watchingl

Pioneers in Practice

The Pioneers will devote most
or their attention this week to
blocking and tackling. Coach Guy
Lookabaugh wants the boys to be
able to handle the Manders broth-
ers, not to mention the fleet Su—
ter and Underwood, Plays will
come in tor due consideration,
however, and some scrimmage
will form part of the week's pro-
gram.

There is some bad news ema—
nating from Word field. It is the
