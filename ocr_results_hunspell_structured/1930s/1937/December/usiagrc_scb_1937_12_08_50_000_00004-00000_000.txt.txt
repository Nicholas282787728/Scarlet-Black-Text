LET'S GET TOGETHER!

The new grading system inaugurated
by the faculty was designed to correct faults
inherent in the former system. Unfortu-
nately, however, the new system is seriously
handicapped in securing a fair trial by the
widespread misunderstanding and lack of
knowledge of the exact intent of the new
system.

Perhaps the criticism voiced so vehe-
mently on the campus and in the columns
of this paper would cease to be heard if a
better knowledge of the system existedr
Certainly the students would appreciate
having some of the doubts dispersed. Some
of the faculty members no doubt would
also welcome an authoritative re-statement
of the aims of the grading system so that
faculty members would agree on the value
of the grades.

In the past when revolutionary changes
have been introduced on the campus a stu-
dent—faculty chapel has been held to clarify
the situation. Would not this be a good
technique to dispel misunderstanding of the
new grading system.

We, therefore, strongly urge a student
assembly devoted to a thorough explana-
tion of the new system which has caused
so much comment.

IT'S TIME TO THINK OF JOBS

As the school year gets into full swing,
seniors are beginning to turn selious
thought to the imminent commencement
and its logical concomitant—employment.
To the end that seniors may more easily

find jobs, and jobs in which they will be
more happily situated, this college has
established a triumvirate of institutions. The
first is the appointment bureau, with which
most seniors have already had some contact.
The other two, which by this time have
attracted a good deal of outside attention,
are the vocations forum and the “job hun "
which ends it every year.

The vocations forums have at least two
outstanding advantages which in themselves
will repay constant attendance First, they
give seniors valuable hints on interviewing,
training, personality and other factors
which must be given consideration in search-
ing for employment. Secondly, they enable
seniors to crystallize their thinking on the
kind of employment they seek. Moreover,
they are enabled to meet, both personally
and in groups, men who are actually em-
players and who kllow what employers
want.

The vocations forum can, in effect, be
construed as a course of training, leading
up to the “job hunt.” The effectiveness of
the second will be greatly diminished if the
first is not taken seriously. This fact in
itself constitutes a powerful argument for

'THE GRlNNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

regular attendance at the vocational forums.
But this argument alone is not all. The
student who slights the forums, who feels
that he can gain nothing from the men with
whom he could come in contact there, who
feels that he is already prepared sufficiently
to look for employment, is voluntarily de—
priving himself of a great opportunity for
selﬁadvancement, an opportunity which few
students in other schools get, and an oppor-
tunity which increases ten-fold his chances
of finding satisfying, profitable employ-
lnellt.

Grinnell college feels that its respon-
sibility to its students does not end with
the granting of a diploma. It feels that it
can aid them in their search for positions,
and experience has shown that this aid is
very valuable. It is up to the individual
student to show that he wants this assis-,
tance, and to illdicate his desire by getting
the most he can from the weekly vocational

forums.

GOLDEN CALVES STILL BROKEN

Reprinted from the Syracuse Daily Orange

The Ten Commandments, which are one
of the world’s oldest laws, are still ”consti-
tutional" in this modern age, according t
a poll conducted at New York university,‘
where 1,485 answered queries on these an—
cient laws.

The first three Commandments received
the greatest number of adverse Votes, tho‘
these were very meager, Approximately SOOI
students voted against acceptance of the:
dictates, “I am the Lord, thy God, and thou:
shalt have no other Gods before Me" ; “Thou
shalt keep holy the Sabbath day.“ Toward
the latter Commandment most churches of
all denominations are taking a liberal atti-l
tude and opposing “blue laws” in state
statutes. Today movies, baseball, and foot-
ball are all booming with Sunday crowds.

It is good to note that the Command-
ment to which N.Y.U. students showed least‘
opposition was the fourth, “Thou shaltl
honor thy father and thy mother." If pure-
ly in the material sense college students in
particular should be most grateful to their,
parents who have many times made sacri-
fices so that they might obtain advantages
of “higher learning.”

If one reads tliru all of the Tell Coni—
mandments and gives them a “modern ill-
terpretation” he will find that they are}
applicable today. Alliances, Kellogg pacts,i
and other methods for insuring peace would
not be needed if countries would merely oh-I
serve the Commandments.

The Commandments will stand, for theyl
have been tested in courts of nearly every
quarter on the globe and found to be in ac»
cord with the modern code of ethics.

A FAST TIME G

Reprinted from the Daily O'Oolicginli

In 1927 when ah adventurous ail-
traveler boarded an air liner at New York
City it was 33 hours before he landed at‘
San Francisco. The plane made 14 stops.
Now the two cities are but 15 hours apartl
by air. The plane roars two hundred miles:
an. hour and does not land until it reaches
its destination. If a passenger, in 1927, be-I
came sleepy he might adjust his seat to a
reclining position and cat—nap above the
roar of the plane. It was a matter of phy-
sical exhaustion. If he became hungry, he}
could open the cardboard box which he
balanced on his knees. All this a decade‘
ago.

Today the new mainliners make a
transcontinental trip in 15 hours. One may
engage a compartment with bed and all the
rest of the facilities of his sleeping roomI
He may order breakfast ill bed, or later
page a full course meal served to him piping
’10 .

This is indeed a. fast time. Civiliz tion
is traveling at high speed; like a freely fali-’
ing body every motion makes way for a
faster one. Logic and reason never change,
but the applications do. People who apply
these to things as they did 10 years ago
are going to remain in the parade. Those
who can work ever faster and faster are
going to lead. The cavalcade marches on.
