BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MEN‘.7

Several weeks ago, a number of Grillnell college women
were honored when they were elected to the Mortar Board,
a national honorary organization which stresses scholarship,
leadership, character, ability, and achievements. One of the
important features which goes with this honor is that it is
conferred upon the individual for other, and perhaps more
important things than more scholarship alone. It is the
ability to lead others and the character which often draws
others to the leader that many times means a great deal
more in later life than merely a brilliant mind. Grinnell
women are to be congratulatL-Ed upon Supporting an organi-
zation with so excellent a purpose.

But what about the men? They have no such group
which confers honors upon deserving men. At Iowa State
college there is an organization, the Cardinal Key, whose
membership is based upon character, leadership, scholarship,
and service to the college. It meets with the members of
the Mortar Board of that school each spring and fall and
the two groups attempt to solve campus problems through
an intelligent discussion. An organization of that type
would be worthwhile on the Grinnell campus for the men
students because there is no organization here which gives
recognition to men who have contributed greatly to Grinnell
life in a constructive way.

Besides the Cardinal Key, there is the Greek letter fra»
ternity, Omicron Delta Kappa. There is the Blue Key, an
organization of Similar type. Griunell men might well peti»
tion one of these national honorary groups for a charter
because there seems to be a definite need for such a frater-
nity on our campus.

Grinnell women who have been of service to their school
and who have contributed to our college life are honored by
the Mortar Board. Grinnell men who have been of service
to their school and who have contributed to our college life
go unrewarded. It would be a forward step if such an or-
ganization as Omicron Delta Kappa, the Blue Key, or the

Cardinal Key were established here for Grinnell men.

SILLY, ISN’T IT?

The following editorial appeared in Monday's Des
Moines “Register," and we feel it merits careful student at-
tention:

“A British official, whose job it is to co-ordinate the
evacuation of refugees from certain death if Bilbao falls to
the rebels, made a statement which ought to be of supreme
interest to every American who is concerned with the de-

fense of this country. ‘
“ ‘Insurmountable difficulties’ would prevent removal of

150,000 refugees, he said, and chief among the difficulties
is lack of sufficient vessels.

“If the French and British navies cannot furnish suffi»
cient vessels to evacuate 150,000 refugees from the Basque
country, less than 100 miles from the French coas and less
than 1,000 miles from England itself, then Ame calls can
naturally ask this question:

‘ “How can any power under the sun expect to transport
troops enough to this country, a million or so at a time, to
make an effective attack, remembering there is an ocean
3,000 miles wide on the east, and 6,000 miles wide on the
west? What would our own coastal defenses be doing in
the meantime?

“Once again the absurdity of the invasion bogey is dem—
onstrated.

“Each time the question of army and navy appropria-
tions comes around, this country becomes wide open to in-
vasion by any nation that floats a ship. No hysteria is too
fantastic to provide new reasons for another hundred million
dollars or so for defense.’

“Actually the United States is aiming itself on a for»
eign war basis.

“Where? And ill the name of reason, why ‘2"

This seems to express succinctly our own views on

United States armaments.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Songs Given by Men’s Glee Club
Appealing to Non-Musicians

Work, Miller ImpressiveY
in $010 Selections,
Critic Finds

By RICHARD KUNCL

A formal and diversified pro-
gram was presented last evening
in Herrick chapel by the Men’s
Glcc club in its fortyrthird annual
home concert. The contrasting
selections gave the songs added
distinctiveness, and their appeal
seemed to lie in the fact that they
were not above the heads of nuns
musicians.

Nevin's “Venetian Love Song"
ranked best in interpretation in
the first part of the program, alr
though Lovatt's "The Hundred P17
pers" with its decided rhythm and
swing was more entertaining.
For novelty stock's “Route
Marchin’ 'l set the pace. It is par-
ticularly suited for men's Voices.

The two solists of the evening,
Robert Work and William Miller,
contributed decidedly to the pro»
gram. “Ishtar" by Spross and
sung by Work was impressive in
its mood, while Miller‘s singing of
Sans Souci's “Love Is a Rose" and
Malla-Zucca’s ”I Love Life" repre-
sented mellowness to the audience
in the first case, and a hearty ro-
bustness in the second, Both men’s
voices have improved in quality
and resonance since last year.

Another major tragedy was
headlined Friday when the Ger—
man airship Hindenburg was
destroyed by an exploSlon which
cost the lives of more than 30
passengers and crew. The ship
was concluding her first 1937 trip,
and had just dropped her ground
lines when a spark apparently set
the highly inflammable hydrogen
gas atlamo. The Hindenburg
was one of the few airships still
using hydrogen rather than heli-
um for lifting power. Germany
has no supply of helium but had
been extended the privilege of
buying some of the gas from the
United States, which has a mono-
poly on it.

The proposed new Irish (ionsll‘
tution, announced last week by
Pres. Eamon de Valera, has not
yet met with a great deal of sup-
port. The proposed constitution
would not make enough change in
the relations between the irish
Free state and England to satisfy
the Irish leaders.

The budget message sent to
Congress by the President is still
a prime cause of worry to most
congressmen. It seems likely,
however, that the final result will
be a cut of from 10 to 15 per cent
in current appropriations.
