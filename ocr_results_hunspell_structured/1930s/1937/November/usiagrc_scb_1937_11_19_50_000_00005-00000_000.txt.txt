Famed Painﬁngs

Exhibi’red Here

Nine reproductions in full color-
of modem French and Amel‘icanl
paintings are now on exhibit in
the main corridor of Main cottage
The exhibit will continue until
Thanksgiving vacation, according
to Miss Edith A. stemfeld, assis-
tant professor of design and paints
ing.

The prints form the first unit of
a circulating collection begun last
year with the purchase of a Van
Gogh portrait, which has been
hung in Carney house and in Pine
Tree place, Miss sternfeld said.

All but one of the present group
are from the collection of 17 pier
tures presented to the department
last spring by the Carnegie corv
poration of New York to form the
nucleus of “a leading library of
art.” from which students might
rent pictures for use in private
rooms or cottage or hell clubs
rooms, she stated.

Consider Murphy
for Federal
Labor Posi-

President Roosevelt, it was
learned Tuesday, is considering
Ray Murphy, Iowa insurance
commissioner, who spoke at a
special ,Armistice Day chapel
here, for the position of assist-
ant secretary of labor.

Murphy, a former national
commander of the American Le-
gion, is one of several being serir
ously considered.

A written recommendation from
Senator Guy M. Gillette of Iowa
has been requested for formal
submission to the president.

Murphy's name was put for-
ward independently by American
Legion groups in Washington who
sought Senator Gillette’s approv-
al.

A brain institute which will
make Washington the world capi-
tol for the study of the brains of
animals and humans is being es-
tablished at Georgetown universi.

Somehow as we go along in life,
things grow smaller. We had a
few gods-on-earth to worship
when we were freshmen. Paul
Trigg's DORIC will always re-
main in our memory as rivaling
Pope for keen satire and Noel
Coward for suave sophistication.
His ode to Denton Cobble, on the
occasion of a certain eventful
evening in the dorms deserves
immortality.

There is no longer glamour on

And Grinncll did have a meaty
past. We recall legends told of
the class that graduated Just be
fore we arrived. There was the
story of how, the day after Com-
mencement, the college truck
called at Westfield to collect 13
mattresses and return them to
the dorms.

In the same class was is young
man who had not only a car, but
a tent under the back seat for
inclement weather.

Even in our mm day, we have
seen Twitchell's famed snow-hut
and McLead‘s emporium.

“'0 are a little insulted that no
one has yet accused us of writing
this column of pure beauty. But
on the whole complete anonymity
is most satisfactory. We are
able to take those worth writing
about off guard, and avoid the

are just dying for publicity.
