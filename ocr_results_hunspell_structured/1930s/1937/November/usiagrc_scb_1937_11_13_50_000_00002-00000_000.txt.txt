REGRESSIVE OR PROGRESSIVE?

With the inauguration of the new grading system, the
requirements for junior and senior exemption from absence
limitations have been raised. Whereas under the former
system it was necessary to get no grade below that of 'J‘B‘,
it is now required that no grade shall be below “Si
grade equal to a low “A” or a high “B" under the_ old sys—
tem. It has also been announced that exemption from
limitation will not apply even to these students before and
after vacation periods, when triple cuts are given.

The old cry of the facility is that they do not Want
to place irksome rules and regulations on the student body,
that student conduct forces such treatment, that student
irresponsibility requires the placing of severe penalties on
students who cross over the line. Yet, the faculty now
moves to limit the exemption it formerly accorded to those
whom it believed to be trustworthy and capable of exer-
cising their own judgment. The old standard necessary for
unlimited cuts was sufficiently high that only a handful of
therbest students could pass it. Those who did secure un-
limited cuts were conspicuously trustworthy in the exercise
of the privilege accorded them.

The ability to regulate one’s self without authority im-
posed from above is one of the most valuable characteristics
that could be acquired under the heading of education. Yet,
when students have shown themselves capable of showing
this quality, the faculty moves to restrict the privilege to
even fewer students. How much more valuable to the stu-
dent body, and to the college as a whole it would be to ex—
tend this privilege until it included a larger section of the
student bodyiextended until all that are capable of re»
gulating themselves are accorded the right to do so.

This would offer a double advantage as contrasted with
the present system. First, it would place responsibility in
the hands of all those capable of handling it, so’ building a
more serious attitude toward the classroom as a place of
knowledge and achievement, rather than a. guardhouse to
which one is periodically condemned by the faculty‘s rules.

Secondly, the privilege of exercising the perogative
to the best advantage of the student would place a definite
premium on good scholarship. For all but the few
who aspire to Phi Beta Kappa there is now no incentive
offered other than a natural desire to do well. Would it not
be worth while to offer a more tangible reward for effort
and bring the rewards of improved scholarship within the
reach of a larger section of the campus.

We favor then, in place of the faculty’s step to restrict
unlimited cut privilege, the extension of this privilege to a
larger section of the student body, thereby encouraging the
exercise of responsibility, and offering further incentive to

scholarship.

Haines Lounge as Part

Freshman women, reported on
the “black list” for violating
propping rules, painted furniture
and sewed pillows today to
decorate the Haincs cottage
lounge as a part of their punish-
ment, according to Betty carnes,
president of are League board.

Upperclasswomen will continue
to turn in names of those freshr
man women violating rules until
'Christmas vacation, Miss (James
said.

She would not release
names of the delinquents.

The “black list" has been in
force since Friday when “improvee
ment days" tor freshman women
were held. '

The list is composed of names
of women who have not met the
requirements of the League board
in the prepping program, Miss
Carnes pointed out. Names of de—
lniquents are turned in to the
house chairman of each cottage
every day by upperclasswomen

Comments of
the Readers

Dear Editor:

I was much pleased to read in
the last issue of the Scarlet and
Black the Board's editorial on the
revision of the “cut system” as
opposed to the best interests of
the freshman and sophomore
classes. The criticism was time-
ly, if not overdue. It was well
stated.

I should like to go a step fur-
ther, however. It is time that
some of the apron string tactics
of Grinnell college he done away
with entirely. Cut systems are
out of date in prop‘essively-
minded institutions of higher edue
cation. Is the Pioneer spirit of
Grinnell dead?

.College students are not forced
to attend school. They come be-
cause they want to learn. They
pay a goodly sum for that privr
lege, and, supposedly, they are
above average in intelligence.
They know for what they are
paying their money and spending
four valuable years of their life.
When they finish their college
careers, they are expected to be
more or less matured individuals.
Do adolescents become more ms-
tured under a system wherein
they are bound to their Alina
Mater's apron strings and kept in
the classroom under her motherly
eye, or in one where they are putI
on their own responsibilityitol
win or lose? The answer is in
portant.

I believe that the Grinncll pro-
fessors are capable of keeping
their pupils interested. If. how
ever. the “high standard” of Grin—
nell cannot be kept without corn-
pulsory class attendance, it is to
the faculty rather than to the
student body that discipline should
be awarded. Under the present
system, the former are baskinglin
a doubtful gloryilecturing to
large classes required to attend.

Why not give the faculty as
well as the students a chance to
prove themselves?

Higher education indeed:

. Boyd Burchard.

Following coniirimttion of the
signing by Italy of the anti-com-
intcrn treaty between Japan and
Germany, the Russian government
issued a formal protest to the
Italian government.

9 e s

The action is startling for two
reasons, firstly in that the Rus-
sian government should feel
strongly enough to protest, and
secondly that the action puts the
government officially behind the
comlutern, the international or»
ganization cf the communist par-
ty.
