ABILITY! AN ELECTION TEST _

With this issue of the Scarlet and Black, two important
announcements are made, one that the men’s governmental
set-lip has been extensively revised by the Council of House
Presidents, and the other, that the electioll of new house
presidents will be held next Monday night.

Both of these are of great importance to the men of the
campus. The revision of the governmental set-up has been
made in an effort to secure the most qualified inch [or the
respective positions in hall government. To secure this,
specific duties have been assigned to each of the hall offi-
cers, in order that the men when electing their officers may
have a better means of judging whether or not a man has
the qualifications for the position.

The plan as evolved by. the present Council of House
Presidents provides a detailed means for handling of the
various problems It is a plan which should provide a
means for a closer coordination of men’s government within
the respective halls, a coordination which far surpasses any—
thing that has been achieved to date in hall government.
Responsibility for discipline, for social conduct, for intra-
murals, and for finances is concentrated in a group of six
men, who will function in much the same way as the now
out—moded house council.

But the new set-up will only function if the best man in
each hall are selected to fill the v: ‘10115 offices Popularity,
too often the sole means of judging a man’s ability in the
past, will have but slight place in the new system if the
plan is to work properly. The primary requisite in the
coming elections should be the question. Does this man
have the qualifications to properly fulfill the office for
which he is being nominated?

The duties of the various offices have been defined by
the present Council of House Presidents, but whether or
not this information will be used in the coming election,
depends solely upon the men in each building.

If you, and you, and you—the men who will be the
voters in the coming electionianswer the question, Is the
man qualified, then the new plan should provide a vast im-
provement in the governmental setup. But if the elections
are merely on a basis of favoritism and popularity, then
neither the new system, nor the old system, nor any system
ever devised will be able to function satisfactorily,

Ability, rather than popularity, should be the basis of
the coming elections, and upon that issue will the success or
failure of the recently developed reformed men’s govern
ment set-up, stand or fall. Ability only can make the new
plan or any plan, of government succeed
