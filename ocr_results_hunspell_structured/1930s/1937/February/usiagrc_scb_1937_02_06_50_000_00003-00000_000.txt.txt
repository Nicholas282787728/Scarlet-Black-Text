Claudette Colbert says:

“My throat is safest with
a light smoke”

"An actress’ throat is naturally
very important to her. After experi—
menting, I’m convinced my throatis
safest with a light smoke and that’s
why you’ll ﬁnd Luckies always on
hand both in my home and in my

dressing room.

I like the ﬂavor of

other cigarettes also, but frankly,
Luckies appeal must to my taste."

STAR OF PARAMOUNTS FORTHCOMING
“MAID OF SALEM"
DIRECTED BY FRANK LLOYD

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, 87% stated they personally
prefer a light smoke.

Miss Colbert veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref—
erence, and so do other leading artists of the radio,
stage, screen, and opera. Their voices are their
fortunes. That’s why so many of them smoke
Luckies.You, too, can have the throat protection
of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain harsh

irritants removed by the exclusive process “It’s
Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat!
