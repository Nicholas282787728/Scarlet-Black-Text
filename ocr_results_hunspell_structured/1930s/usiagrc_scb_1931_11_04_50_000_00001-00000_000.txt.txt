Grinnell-Ame: May Play
Football Game for Charity

Since the proposed University of
Iowa-lows State college football
game for charity has been prevented
by Big Ten conference ruling, efforts
are being made to schedule an Iowa
state collegerGrinnell game at the
close of the regular season.

if such a game is arranged it will
be probably played at Des Moines,
proceeds going to charity. Grinnell
did not play the Iowa State outfit
last year but lost two years ago and
counted a 3-0 victory over the Cyn
clones here at homecoming the prev-
ious season.

Liberal Class

First Lecturer Here Says
Bruening Personifies

New Statesman

All German lcadcrs, except Hin—
tlenhiirg, according to Dr. Ernst
Jacckh. who spoke in Herrick chapel
here Monday night, come from the
liberal bourgeois class, and could
never have gnincd their prescnt polit-
ical influence under the old regime.

Mr. Jacckh, founder- and first presi-
dent of the Hochscliule fur Politik in
Berlin, a former member of the fed-
eral economic council, and member-
of the German delegations to Ver-
sailles, Genoa, income, and Geneva
gave the first number.
of the Grinnell lecture course. His
subject was “German Leadership."

New Conception

While much of his material was
not new, it was presented in a fresh.
direct manner. He pointed out that
the majority of leaders come from
the southwestern part of' German,
the seat of an old political culture
and civilization before Prussia was
even christianized.

Dr. Jeeckh stressed the import-
ance of the new conception of states-
manship, personified by Bruening,
which places emphasis on the inter-
dependence of all nations. The Hitler
movement, he believes is an expres-
sion of the disappointment and re»
sennnent of the German people over
the Versailles treaty.

Better Outside of League

Only cooperation with other na-,
tions during the next three years can
prevent the nationalists from Will—
ning the next election, Dr. Jaeckh
said. Germany, because of its geo-
graphical position, is vitally concern-
ed with the welfare of all Europe,

The United States, in his opinion,
has more influence outside of the
League of Nations than it would have
if it joined the group.

Money’s Worth,“ and “The Neinesis'
of American Business,” will appear

ST. LomssliDown Grinnell” is
the slogan at Washington university
this weak as the Bears prepare for
their last chance to win a Missouri
Valley conference game this season.

With prospects of closing the
schedule in the loop cellar, Coach Al
Sharpe is trying to lrecp his men on
their toes this week to have them in
shape to stop Grinnell's aerial at—
tack and the running of the fleet
Pioneer quarter, Thomas.

Beefy Lino

Local fans, who saw Grinnell in ace
tion against St. Louis university here,
give Washington an even chance to
win, despite a 4070 loss to Creighton
and a 26—0 loss to Drake. The beefy
Bear line should count for more
against the scarlet and black aggre-
gation than against any other con—
ference teams.
The Washington line will be even
stronger against Grinnell than in the
Drake game last week, with Wheeler

pounds will make it tough going for

Coach Sharpe has indicated that
he may start his second string so
that his regulars may See the Grin-
nell offense in action before they take

Mentor Stresses
Overhead Defense

Defense has been on the program
for Coach L. L. (Fuzz) Watt‘s Pion-
eers this week. Confident that his
passing and running attack, headed
by Hank Thomas, who has‘managed
to star in every game this season,
will score against the Washington
eleven in the homecoming game here
Saturday, the mentor has been show-
ing his men how to stop their first
conference opponent.

Varsity gridmen got a chance
against the Shots of their own tosser
Monday when Thomas went over to
the yearling squad to do the passing.
Yesterday the reserves tried a hand
at the overhead game against the
regulars, Mcci-esry and Waite doing
the passing work.

Gould nt Tackle

Freshmen took the offensive in
scrimmage Tuesday with little suc-
cess. Gould, at Lake’s tackle, showed
a good defensive game and Duncan
broke through regularly to smother
pass attempts.

Proper pass defense was stressed
throughout with special attention to
roughing the receiver, Two Carleton
passes were completed last week as
Grinnell backs reached for the man
taking the hall instead of taking the
oval,
