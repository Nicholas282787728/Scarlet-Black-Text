The crafty pitching of Russell Ruff,
captain of the Building Three nine,
virtually eliminated Gates hall from
the running for the outdoor baseball
championship Tuesday. Although he
received faulty support, Ruff came
through in the crucial moments to
win, 11-3.

leble hall remained in a tie with
Three for first place, defeating Lang-
an 12 to 3 Monday. The two league
leaders will hattle it out in the final
game on the schedule next week. pro-
viding each wins its game the latter
part of this week, Smith, Langan
and Clark have yet to win a game,
each team having lost two, forming
a three-way tie for the cellar posi-
tion.

Tatom may get his first taste of
