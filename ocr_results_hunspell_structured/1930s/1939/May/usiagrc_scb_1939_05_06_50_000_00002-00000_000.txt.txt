Sensationalism rarely prevents action; rath-

it can’t be evactly a thrilling triumph to
give a senior recital to at ”capacity" crowd
of twenty-five or thirty people! In fact, it
must be very discouraging to reach the most

career and find others apparently so disill-

Few students, outside the comparatively
small group of music majors, really appre-

CORNELL'S OBJECT LESSON

According to this week’s issue of “Time,”
the object lesson which occurred at Cornell
college last April 21 was “perhaps the most
successful bit of peace propaganda attempt-
ed" on the nationwide “Peace Day." Cer-
tainly those enterprising students who rous-
ed late sleepers and disrupted classes with
fake news of a declaration of war, scared
the assembled student body into a furor by
announcing a draft, and pacified it with
swing music, are to be commended for their
ingenuity and their spirit, But, despite
”Time's" comment, we Wonder how much
they actually accomplished besides making
the headlines.

Even those hundred throats which de—
cried as ‘yellow‘ the lone objector who dated
assert himself. a few minutes later were
singing pacifist songs. Apparently a jam
session was all that was needed to restore
the crowd’s equilibrium. We must conclude
that peace is not to be attained by propa-

Chapel Program

The chapel program for next

ally received as much practice, and havel
been as smoothly presented as some of the
programs given by professionals whom the
college has paid to entertain Grinnell stu-
dents.

Admission to professional programs is
made by semester fee booklets, but recitals
are free. Since students feel they must get
everything they can out of their books or
believe they are missing something worth-
while, perhaps senior recitals should be in-
cluded in semester fees.

Any intelligent person, however, realizes
that the value of a performance can‘t be
measured by its price or absence of price.
Students, therefore, probably fail to attend
recitals because they aren’t well enough in-
formed about them The music department,
regardless of any schism concerning the
value of a recital to a public school teach-
er, might do well to publicize these per-
formances.

After four years of hard work, music
majors deserve a better reception than they
have been receiving. Right at this season
there are many recitals being presented We
can find out when and where on the weekly
calendar, but its mere statement of fact
scarcely stirs up a desire for us to attend
We leave it up to you: do we need semester
fee coupons to make us appreciate the talent
which is around us, or is the solution more
advantageous advertising?

To the Editor of the

SCARLET AND BLACK:
Responding to your "FiicIt" edi-
torial on issuing statements of
men's absence records, I am glad
to give additional information. For
the past several years the dean
of men's office regularly follows
ed the practice ’of sending out
statements to all men in the col-
liege informing thcm of their
standing from time to time as to
.absences, always with the note
‘adde ~ ”This statement can not
be guaranteed to be up to date.
You may have taken other eb-
sences which have not yet been
reported to this office. Therefore
you must be responsible now for
your own record. Please verif
this report if you think there is
an error in it.”

The purpose of that service was
obviously to hclp prevent men’s
forfeiting credit for nbscnces.
However, in practice it resulted
in men’s saying to faculty com-
lmittces when they had forfcited
credit because of excessive abs
sences, "Well, I received a notice
just before I took more cuts say»
ing 1 had c certain low number.
and then the very day after I
took more cuts I found that the
total was much larger men had
