hurdles; Ted Appelquist, 4th in
the loonyd. dash; and Harold
Seeger. 4th in the BRO-yd. run.

Saturday's meet ended the sea-
son for Grinneu. Despite the
handicap of not having a track
to practice on, the Pioneers have‘
bad a successful season. The
outstanding feature of the year
was undoubtedly the performance
at the Beloit relays. The Pie-
neers. without the aid of Burke
Powers, finished second in a field
of twenty-seven colleges. If
Powers had been able to broad
jump, Grinnell would have won
the meet.

will have a chance to learn and
practice various track and field
events. Duke will concentrate all
his efforts on track next fall and
will not assist in football.

season are Ted Appelquist, Paul
Baiohly. Neuman Fell. Robert
Jones, Fred Luther, William Pee

years a. succession of active, spir-
ited senior classes was an aid to
the growth of Crinnell by class
donations, this spirit in recent
years has declined.

The committee, upon President
Nollen's recommendation, decided
to push through an election of‘ a
new president of the present sen-
ior class, possibly this week, to ﬁll
the vacancy caused some time ago
by Lester Shepard‘s leaving school.

Committee members expressed
the hope that, should this year's
senior class become better organ—
ized, a committee would he forni-
ed out of the class to start a
fund which would be added to by
succeeding senior organizations.
Senior Class Election.

The committee was asked by
the president to confer with the
temporary president of the class,
Betty Jane Sheetz, as soon as
possible so that class organiza-
tion may take effect in time to
|inaugurate a class fund.
