Luick Breaks Three
Year, Single Game
Scoring Records

By Clark A. Smith.

When Grinnell meets Tulsa
Thursday night. it will be battling
to keep in the fight for second
place in the Missouri Valley, The
Pioneers' 38 to 35 victory over
Washington Saturday and their

considerably.

Drake Faces Tulsa Tonight,

Bill William’s boys meet Tulsa
tonight before the Golden Hul'rir
cane invades the Pioneers' home
court, so the opportunity for a
tie for second is not remote if
Tulsa beats Drake and Grinnell
can down the Oklahoma team
Thursday.

This means that besides defeat-
ing Tulsa, the Pioneers must
take Washburn Saturday and
Creighton Monday to enter the
Drake game March 3, with a
chance to tic for second or take
undisputed possession of that
spot.

Of course, this is based on the
assumption that Drake Will he un-
defeated until march 13.

Wilbur Luick scored 20 points
against St. Louis to break the
Pioneer singlc gainc scoring re-
cord of 17 points and shatter the

ing record. Lulck's present total
stands at 368 point. one hctter
than Frank Duncans record com-
pleted in 1933.

with four games yet to go, the
big red-headed center shouldn't
have much trouble in putting his
new mark up in the four hun-
dreds.

In the last six contcsts, Luick
has scored 68 points It has been
his play that has spear-headed
the Pioneers drive down the
stretch for second place honors
