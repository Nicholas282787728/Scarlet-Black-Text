Stoddard Lane

Says Kindness
Is Fundamental

"The essence, heart and substance
of religion is kindness," declared
the Reverend Stoddard Lane of
the Plymouth Congregational
church of Des Moines, speaking
before a special college convoca-
tion service Thursday morning.

Lane emphasized that orthodoxy
in religion is not e ough. He
pointed to the Inqlli tion as a
time when unquestionable sincer-
ity was not mixed with kindness
in religion, and the result was in-
humanity.

"A religious act must be a kind
act, and where there is intoler-
ance in religion, it can not be at
its best," said Lane. "One may
go wrong on goodness itself, but
not on kindness,"

"Possibly the most outstanding
characteristic of Jesus was his
kindness,” Lane continued, “and
perhaps if we applied the princi-
ple of kindness today in the lives
of men, conditions would be dif-
ferent."

“The light of kindness is but
the light of God shining through
humanity," Lane declared in con-
clusion.

tions to be held here in June.

Howarth Outlines Four Phases
Of Modern Personnel System

By Gordon McCarty, '
There are four phases to the mod-
ern personnel system as it exists
in industry today, Max H. Ho
warth, chief of personnel relations
for the Teletype corporation of
Chicago, told the vocations forum,
yesterday. The four phases are se-
lection, training, morale building
and maintenance, and public re—
lstions.

Selection is the work that the
department performs in selecting
and interviewing new applicants
and in providing for changes and
advances of the older employees.

The personnel department also
has charge of training of (ink
ployees and educating them in the
work of the corporation. 'This
training is done thh with new
employees and older ones who
wish to learn another phase of
the work.

Morale building and maintc-y
rial-ice is the part of the WDX‘K Of‘
the, personnel department in
which provision is made for bct-‘
ter relationships between em-
ployer and employee. Plans for

 

employee benefits and sickness
compensation are made by the
personnel department through this
phase of the work.

The last phase of personnel
work is public relationship in
which good relations with the
public are maintained,

Touching upon the history of
personnel work, Howarth said
that personnel work is relatively
a new thing in industry. It be—
gan about 1905 with scientific
manage em: in which industries
were di ided into various units
such as accounting, engineering
and what relates to our present
day personnel department, the
welfare department. The welfare
departments did not last because
they were too far removed from
the actual workings of the com-
panics.

Modern personnel work as it is
known today had its beginning in
1926. It has developed and ex-
panded untii today it is one of the
vital and integral parts of our
modern industrial corporations,
Howarth declared in conclusion.

Aid Proposed

Sherman Outlines
Plan to Help Get
Summer Employment

By Ken Mathews.

Adding his Voice to the rise of
interest occasioned over thc “3‘
cent editorial in the Scarlet and
Black, entitled “Is Grinnell Slips
ping," Leo P. Sherman, professor
of chemistry, pointed out yestera
day the three-point proposal of the
faculty committee on vacations to
create a more permanent em-
ployment service at Grinnell,

The committee, of which Sher-
man is a member, believes that
a definite department for job-
finding should be set-up, and that
a paid executive should he hired
to devote his full time to cons
tacting employers and surveying
the various fields to discovor
where the greatest opportunity
lies. An important part of this
plan is the proposition of lining
up summer jobs for the under-
gi dduates.

Sherman feels that the time
has: come for organized collegiate
employment service in colleges.

The faculty committee helieves
that this plan is deﬁnite proof
that Gi-lnnell is still producing
prcgrcssivc ideas. The proposal
would have to have the full sup.
port of the students and faculty
to become anything but a plan,
but Sherman firmly believes that
such n step would definitely keep
Gi-inncll on the map as a pl'O‘
gi-essivc institution.

Pioneers Strive to

Bluejays

Cagers Leave
For Creigh’ron
La+e Tomorrow

By Clark A. Smith.

Ten Pioneer cagers leave
Grinnell Sunday afternoon to
invade Creighton’s Bluejay
nest Monday evening in a

. conference skirmish.

Coach John C. Truesdale's
traveling squad consists of Capt.
Robert Berry, John Turner, Fred
Luther, Wilbur Luick, Jerry Fort,
James Nash, Eugene Peisner,
Vem Robinson, George Tompkins
and Don Ruliﬁson.

The Pioneers will be seeking
their second victory in the twen-

, ty—second renewal of their rivalry

with the Bluejays. Grlnnell has
never won a game on the Omaha
school's home floor, but this year
indications are that Creighton's
string will be broken.

Leading Scorer,
On paper, Ed Hickey’s outfit
appeared to be the strongest team

' in the conference. In Carl Ron and

Dick Shaw, Creighton had two
leading scorers in the circuit, the
latter holding the record of 147
points set last year,

At present, Creighton has been
the disappointment of the league
with many poor performances
miring them well in the second
division, St, Louis beat them 22-
20 on their own floor and it ap-
pears that Grinnell has itsbest
chance to heat Creighton since
the two schools began their riv-
alry in 1926.

Comeback Feared.

The only thing that Truesdale
fears is that his cagers might
catch Hickey's lads on the re~
bound. In such a case, the dope
bucket is due for another tip-
ping. it is up to the Pioneers to
be fully prepared for a Bluejay
team storming for a comeback
victory,

Fred Luther has been bothered
with his knee again, but he will
be ready Monday.

Ganz Recital ‘Deftly Arranged,’

Debussy Interpret

By Robert Hagan.

Rudolph Ganz's piano recital of

Thursday was one deftly arranged

to appeal both to the popular and

the more discriminating tastes.
In his wellvvaried initial group

(which ranged from Each to
Brahms) Cauz recaptured the
cameo-like simplicity of the little
Mozart “Romnnza in A” with a
delicacy at which he is a past
master. He put forth the same
effect in the ingratiating Schu-
bert “G Major Impromptu."

Most Satisfying,

Easily the most satisfying piece
of the group, however, was the
Brahms "E flat Rhapsody,” which
was played with n rhythmical 50s
noi-ity, and some really skillful
pedal effects.

Csnz has never been (at least
in the times this critic has heard
him) what one might call a "pas-
Sionatc” pianist, and he is least

 

ations Praised

at home in those compositions re-
quiring a certain measure of the
“grand" manner.

rliiint Moods.

When Canz plays in the intimate
and more pliant moods, he is dif-
ficult to surpass. His pianissimos
and phrasing are expertly fin-
ished, and one could not hope for
more in the way of Debussy in-
terpretations than his playing of
the “Reflets dans l’Eau," or
“L’Ile Joyeuse."

In fact this critic would like
nothing so much as to hear Ganz
play in n recital in which Ravel,
Debussy, and the other moderns
were prepondera‘tely represented;
for when interpreting their per-
fectly balanced subtleties, one
feels that he is at his best. This
circumstance was amply demon-
strated by Ganz's resilient treat-
ment of the Ravel “thanera,”
which was the first encore.
