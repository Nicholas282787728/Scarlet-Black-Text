MINES FOR EUROPE

A short time ago there was a casual news—
paper item that an army airplane had
crashed in California. The pilot was killed,
the passenger somewhat injured. Well, so
what!

The next day the passenger’s real identity
was learned He was a representative of
the French army sent here to survey the
possibilities of obtaining several hundred
American planes. Immediately the questions
arose, “Is the American government involv-
ed in selling planes?" "Has the army di—
vulged any secrets of airplane construc-
tion ’l“ Congress has debated; the military
affairs committee has been called into se-
cret session with the President; European
dictators howl with rage; Britain and
France are elated.

We know that the American government
is not itself selling planes, and that the army
has not let out any secrets. Then isn’t this
proposed sale to France exactly like the sale
during the past year to England: merely
the sale of warplanes by American manu-
facturers to a foreign government? The
answer is ”yes" There is no difference

The gist of the whole event is this~the
government is not itself engaged in supply-
ing war planes to anyone, but is doing ev—
erything possible informally to aid France
and England Yes, warplanes for Europe.
We hope it doesn't mean soldiers for Europe
in the not distant future.

ANOTHER NEW LEAF

Men are always striving to make their lives
fuller, better and richer. Most of us indulge
ill a good deal of wishful thinking about
what we could accomplish if we had time,
or if college work weren’t so hard, or if, in
general, conditions were different. This kind
of thinking is valuclcss unless it is followed
by some sort of action on our part, designed
to make changes which will improve our
way of life. Many of us have good inten—
tions, but when it comes to making a tangi»
ble change in our habits, inertia conquers
initiative. At certain times in the year, how-
ever, nature seems to have provided us
with special opportunities for reviewing the
past, and making new plans for the future.
Many of us use our birthdays to consider
our accomplishments of the last year, and
to resolve to profit by our mistakes and
failures in the next one. Others make New
Years resolutions ill at attempt to change
their lives for the better—“To start the
New Year right."

Right now, one of these natural opportun-
ities for “turning over a new leaf” is at the

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

disposal of every Grinnell student, The first
semester is over, for better or for worse. If
it is foolish to let lost opportunities worry
us too much it is equally foolish not to profit
from our own experience, and to resolve to
make the second semester all that the first
should have been. In this world, experience
is bought so dearly that it is a shame not}
to make the best possible use of it.

The cynic, and perhaps the hard-headed
realist too, may argue that the chains of
habit and custom are too strong to be brok-
en, and that “we learn from experience that
we learn nothing from experience." This at-
titude has an unpleasant amount of truth
in it; more, perhaps than most of us realize.
A different idea is represented by this badly
rimcd couplet:

“Of all the words the world has seen
The saddest are these, ‘It might
\ have been.’ ”

CARlETON’S WELCOME

(Reprinted from the Midwest Merry-go-rounu by
Jack William in The Carletonian.)

Grinnell was formally accepted as a mem—
ber of the Midwest conference at its annual
winter meeting held ill Chicago, December
3, The action taken by Grinnell follows a
standing invitation issued several years ago
before its withdrawal from the Missouri
Valley conference .
This takes a lot of heat off the athletic
department and the student body. Grinnell,
in past years, has been attempting to com-
pete on equal terms with larger institutions
whose methods of recruiting athletes have
not been, shall be say, “Simon Pure." By
entering into the competition with schools
of the same size and principles, Grinnell
expects and should meet with better success.
Grinnell alld Carleton are old rivals and
have always been good friends. We there-
fore welcome Grinnell into the Midwest
conference with the hope that their wish for
”happier days” athletically, comes true.

PEDIGREED SLANG

(Reprinted from Syracuse Daily orange)

Attackers of American ”slanguage” as a
modern manifestation of mental laziness
must have been shocked at the recent dis-
closure by University of Buffalo librarians
that hundreds of popular linguistic distor-
tions are of ancient literary vintage.

Shakespeare was the greatsct contributor,
and the complaint that things were “not 5.0
hot,” voiced ill “Winter‘s Tale," was his
greatest gift to slang. It was the bard him-
self who volunteered “I’ll tell the world!"
Sir Walter Scott offered to “tell it to the
marines,” but choicest of them all goes back
to John Byron, who penned “Nuts to you”
165 years ago.

Not all the tidbits of current American
speech are traceable to such blue-blooded
literally ancestry. The recently swung nur—
sery tulle, ”A Tisket a Tnsket,” defies de-
finition by even the latest collections of
Webster. Nor is “a flat-foot floogie” part
of the Websterian nomenclature. ,

Quite noticeably, the trend toward the
revolutionary in American conversation has
its chief emphasis in the world of swing
music, where startling expressions mush—
room over-night, take the country by storm,
and die as rapidly. And so it is that today a
“jam session” needs no bread, an “alliga»
tor” belongs to the genus “jitterbug,” and
“to jive” is no worse than to ”beat it out."

Hundred percenters take immediate alarm
at the country’s preference for non—regal
English. They term slang the jabberings of
an indolent race, too lazy to use polite, spe»
cific language.

But where ill history, ill any language,
have overtones and intonation: been com»
billed to produce a symbol that equals the
sheer expressiveness of impatient disinterest
that is conveyed in the American’s “So
What!”?

G

“There are numerous forms of sloppiness
which have been incident to the buoyant, easy-
gomg spirit or America,.,democracy cannot at-
rord to be sloppy.” So insists Pres, Dixon Ryan
Fox of Union college hitting at the collegiate cult
of slappiness which, he says, settles habits which
