Smith Drive On Road Trip

Truesdale Works
With Reserves to
Strengthen Squad

By Clark A. Smith.

With six games on the docket for
the next two weeks, Coach John
c, Truesdale is giving ins start-
ing lineup a rest this week.
Meanwhile, die reserves are be
ing worked hard to determine
their status for road trips
Omaha and St. Louis.

The Pioneer mentor is still
trying to solve his problem of
reserve strength. He believes that i
the strenuous schedule will de-
mand more man power.

Followers Disappointed.
When the Grinnell eagers Won

only three out of five games in
their last home stand,‘they di i
appointed their followers to some
extent. The results of the Mi

souri Valley race remain far from i
settled, and no team in this ter-i
ritory has asserted its supremacy

for N, C, A. A, recognition. i
A rousing comeback in the vic-

tory column might put an en—
tirely new lease on life for Coach
Trliesdale’s men.

As their mentor says. “We
still have a chance. but we’ll have
to play real hall every night to,
come out on top. The pl‘essux‘e’s
on us, and we can't afford to
let it take us from here on."
At Peak ol Form.

If the indications of the last
half of the Washington game
and the entire st, Louis contest
mean anything, Grinnell’s cagers
are at the peak of their form.

With Wilbur lLuick playing the!
finest basketball of his career
and forming the speal‘»head of
the attack, the Pioneers appear
to be headed for a valiant stretch
drive in the valley race.

Lnick has been hitting the has-
ket consistently, and his covering
the backboard on offense and de»
fense has been a revelation.
Luther, Berry Doing Well.

The other men have been doing
just as well, too. Fred Luther
has got his old scoring eye back
and his passing and floor play is
uncanny.

Capt. Robert Berry’s detensive
work has been everything that
could he desired John Turner
has started pouring them in from
well out on the floor, and Jerry
Fort, despite a sore ankle, has
maintained a comfortable lead.

James Nash and Gene Peisner
have seen little service but have
also showed improvement.

RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

By Clark Smith
Grinnoll students deserve a pat
on the back for the excellent fol-
lowing thoy gave their swimming
team. According to Capt. Bill
Soldier, the Pioneer splashcrs
have a hetter following in that
sport than any of the other col-
leges they have encountered,
“When we swim away from Grim
nell," Seidler says. “we swim he-
fore a row of empty seats. it
means a lot to the fellows on the
team to know that the school is
backing them,"
And speaking of attendance at
sport events, the crowd lhati
stoycd for the wrestling meet
after the st. Louis game was
awarded for its patience. They
saw several fast and clevcrmatclh
es against the Simpson Lenin,
Wrestling is a comparatively new
sport at Grinnell, but it deserves
every hit as much of student holy
followmg as does swimming, ioo‘
hall and basketball. No one can
afford to miss the Feb. 18 meet
with Carleton.

s s a;
‘It was a hectic weekend between
semesters with so many spelt
events going on. Things got of(
to a had start when the Wash-
ington basketball team got “lost"
in driving from Des Moines and
delayed the starting time of the
game for almost half an hour.
Then at the last minute, it was
discovered that the prep haskt-
hall team was without opposition
as Iowa state Teachers had not
understood the “agreement" for
the contest “scheduled" Saturdav
afternoon.
Then the swimming meet has
lost on a tough break to Marie
mouth. The fact that a relay
swimmer “jumped the gun" should
not be a reflection on anyone he-
cause it is liable to happen in
any meet where the competition
is keen. St. Louis university's
baskethall team in the semi-Winds
up of the weekend put lots of
color into it by having no less
ithan 13 personal fouls called on
