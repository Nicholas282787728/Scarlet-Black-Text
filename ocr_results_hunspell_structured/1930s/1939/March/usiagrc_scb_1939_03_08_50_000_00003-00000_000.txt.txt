By Cordell McCarty.

The effect of the Japanese-Chinese
war in America In case or a
Japanese victory was the keynote
of Owen D. Lattimore's sixth of
a series of eight lectures on Far
Eastern affairs in Herrick chapel
last night.

"The traditional point or View,"
Lattinior-e said, “)5 that it Japan
conquered china Alncl‘lca would
have very little to lose, she could
go on trading aridinvostingin the
Orient just the same. Imports,
which have increased With Man-
churia since the Japanese occupar
tion, would continue only more so
in greater China, if taken by
Japan."

China Production Limited.

Lattimoie then pointed out the
fallacy of this pouit of view.

“China produces 0111‘ a limited
number of raw materials," he
said. ”Therefore, Japan, even in
the event that she did capture the
whole of China, would have to
buy raw materials from other
countries, Their to pay for these
she would have to sell manufac-
tured goods.”

These manufactured goods would
he produced in China by cheap
and exploited labor which would
be put on the world lilal'kcl. at
cut~throat prices. Thus, China

would he put on an economy simr
ilar to the one that Japan has
now.

Extension oi Fascism.

“If Japan wins." Lattimore
stated, “it means an extension of
Fiascism in Asia."

Lattinioi-e then explained that
Fascism is a kind of capitalism,
but a savage and ravenous one.

Bad capitalism will tend to
drive out good capitalism in the
same way that had money is
said to drive good out ot circula»
tion, he asserted.

I\\ls Would Bo Wealtcned.

Japan’s victory would rcvcrt
Europe to tooth and nail tactics
and as a result the wndard of
living of the democratic nations
would be lowered,

Lattimore concluded by telling
how, If Japan loses, the Rome-
Bellili—Tokio axis will he consider»
ably weakened.
