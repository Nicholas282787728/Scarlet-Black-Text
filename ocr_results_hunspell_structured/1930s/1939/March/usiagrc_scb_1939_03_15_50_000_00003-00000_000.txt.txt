When Should
Democracy Call
Hitler’s Bluﬂ.J

By REM.

’hvo weeks ago I wrote of Nazi
activities which were tolerated,
perhaps mistakenly, in this counr
try. Now it has come time again
to write of Nazi activities on the
international front. Sunday's Des
Moines Register printed a map
of “Europe Today": this title has
proved to be almost literally
true. Even as I write, it may

be that Czecho»Slovakia is being,

further split up in accession to
added demands on the part of
Chancellor Adolph Hitler.

This latest ultimatum, de—
manding the autonomy of Slo~
vukia and Carpatho-ukrainc,
which will undoubtedly become
immediate puppet Nazi states.
again brings up the question of
just how far Hitler is to be
allowed to go, in the fall,
when the ﬁrst demands were
made on the Czechs, many
prominent individuals thought
that then was the time to call
Hitler’s bluff. However, Cham—
berlain, in his efforts to pre<
serve peace at any price, avoid-
ed a showdown, and granted
Hitler‘s every wish. Now, faced
by Hitler‘s further aggressions.
latest radio reports tell us that
France and Britain have re-
fused to take any action, thus
again leaving the Caechs to
shirt for themselves.

Peace certainly is to be pres
served if humanly possible. How-
ever, it has become the convic»
tion of most people that the post—
ponement of present action is
only making more inevitable a
more disastrous war in the fu-
ture. 0n the other hand, if e
firm stand were taken now, it
seems entirely possible that war
might be averted, and a perma-
nent settlement finally reached.

A firm stand would eermin»
ly cause Hitler to think twice
before rushing into a general
war. If the democracies showed
a little backbone in the present
situation, it is possible that
they could command enough re—
spect to bring about an honor-
able settlement that would sat—
isfy everyone concerned Con-
tinued retreat, on the other
hand, will soon destroy any
prestige the democracies have
left.

Until we get an
authority which everybody re-
spects, some kind of nationally
organized resistance would appear
necessary to check the unlawful
aggressions of the dictators. In
the morning paper appeared a
plan formulated by former Sec-
retary of State Stimson, pleading

for cooperation between the great
democracies to check the fascist
states.

By a strong sun-d, says Stim»
son, we may possibly encour-
age the smaller peaceful nations
to resist the aggression which
threatens them, and which may
eventually threaten us. Our
present policy of watching,
waiting, and conceding is a
“peril to civilization" Retreat
is only destroying the faith of
our citizens in all the principles
we hold sacred: justice to all,
reason rathcr than force, and
equal value to all human per-
sonalities, among atheis.

Mr. Stimson’s arguments sound
rather convincing, and our gov-
ernment seems to be swinging
around to such a position. Fur-
ther developments in Czechor
Slovakia remain to be seen, but,
like Munich, what has happened
will doubtless have a great influ»
ence on what we can expect in the
future.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Botany Department Has Mounted
00 Moss Forms

Collection of 110

By John Marion :
Seven years ago, there appeared
on the market an English trans-
lation of Dr. J. BraunsBlanqueL’s
book, “Pﬂanzensozioiogie.” The
author of this translation was the
professor 0f botany at Grinnell

'College, Dr. Henry S. Gonard. As»

sisting Dr. Conard in this work
was John Eisen. who was at that
time a student here.

The original book was 330
pages in length. the translation
consisted of 439 pages. One re-
viewer remarked that the book
ran so smoothly one would hardr
ly knoiv it came from another
language. The sale of the book
has been just as great in foreign
countries as in the United States.
Dr. Conard is still receiving roy-
alties from the sale. “I have
nearly got back what I paid John
for helping me,” said Gonard.
Conard Invited.

Because of this book. Dr. Con~
ard was invited to read a paper
on American plant sociology at
the international Botanical Con—
gress at Amsterdam in 1935. On
this trip Dr. Cohard, Louisa Sar-
gent, assistant professor of bot-
any, and Inez Henely, reterence
librarian, botanized in Austria and
Ireland before going to Amster-
dam.

In Ireland they spent a week
as the guests of the British Brys
ological (Moss) Society at Killar-
ney. Rare mosses were collected
and brought back for the Grinnell
collection.

Research Work.

other publications of Dr. Con-
ard are: “Plant Associations of
Long Island," a paper of so pages
which appeared in the American
Midland Naturalist, and also in
the same publication “Plant As-
sociations on Land."

Three of Miss Sargent's inimit-
able chapel talks have been pub-
lished in the magazine “Charac-
ter." In the last ten years Miss
Sargent has done research work
and continuous studying of teach
ing and testing in college biology.
She has developed the short ans
swer test in an unusually effec-
tive way.

Study Masses.

Another field of research has
been the study of the mosses of
Iowa. Mosses have been secured
from every county in the state
and part of this work was cons
tained in a masters degree by
Mrs. Willard Craig. This was 217
