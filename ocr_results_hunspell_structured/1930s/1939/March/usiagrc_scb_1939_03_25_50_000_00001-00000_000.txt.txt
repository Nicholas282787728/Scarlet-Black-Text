Water Defies
Analysis; Full
Of Surprises

Spring has returned to Grin-
nell. At least the spring water
is back with us!

Every year when nice weath-
er comes and everyone is be—
ginning to feel happy, the foul
smelling, dirty, yellow water
returns to plague us. The color
is repulsive enough to make us
threaten to give up baths for—
ever, but that is not enough7
the stuff smells worse than the
meat loaf we are served in the
dormitories.

There are rumors that the
stuff is taken directly from A
bar lake, but that is quite im»
probable for the water in Ai—
bor looks quite clean in com-
parison with ours.

Also, Arbor lake never smell—
ed as bad as this does.

There is another school of
thought pl'evalentithat the
water is colored by the pipes.
The only trouble with this
theory is that the pipes are
certainly very selfish to dis-
color the water only in the
spring.

No remedies are ever sug—
gested, the reason being that
it isiuseless to suggest reme—
dies for something that will
soon celebrate its ccutenial.

The water is now so integral
a part of the college that
nothing will ever be done about
it. In fact, there is a rumor
that this "colored” water will
soon be advertised in the catae
log to entice prospective stu-
dents: .

Tuesday and Wednesday evenings
of next week the maddest, mer-
i' st, musical to hit little ole
Grinneli will, be presented by
members of the faculty.

l After sitting through a rehear-
sal Wednesday, we were convmc-
ed that this will be the “high" in
Grinnell entertainment.

l An “uprtoetlate grand opera,"
in which F. Walter Hoffman, in—
structor in singing, sings the fam-
inine lead and Herschel M, Cole
hci-t, assistant professor of jour—
nalism, sings (7) the masculine
load is one of the funnier parts
of a “laugh-full” program.

A chorus made up of such on-
tcrtainei-s as Sargent, Niemeyer,
Spencer, Wittlcr, Pooley, McClen~
on, Working, and many others,
support the two leading singers.

What the chorus doesn't have

 

 

in tone they overly make up in
volume, Most of the acting done
in this opera is on the “hammy”
side, but the cast shows a little
promise of coming around by the
time the “Thing" is presented.

The staging of the production
will not he spectacular, nor the
Costumes (each person is respone
sible for his own) particularly
beautiful, but talent that even
the possessor himself never sus-
pcctcd of having is being brought
to light in this stupendous, colos-
sal, gigantic. ”keen” presentation.

This is only the beginning, for
there will be a tumbling cxhi
tion that will put to shame any
other tumbling exhibition ever
presented! A Russian ballet by
members of the women's physi-
cal education department promises
“much,"

There will be a sketch ShOWA
ing the faculty conception of stu—

Facully Follies to Play Two Night -- Tuesday, Wednesday;

Features-—Opera, Russian Ballet, Tumbling, Braintruslers

dent life at Grinncll, and a series
of living pictures posed by faculty
members. '

Firing questions at Colbert,
Pooley, and Seiver will be Stephen
Cogswell in an “Information
Please" act. If any set of ques-
tions fool these three master
lmlnds, the person who asked the
questions will receive a cash prize,

Summing the whole “Thing” up,
,it appears that the theater-goers
of Grinnell are in for some eu-
joya‘blc entertainment, the like of
which has not been seen around
lhcrc since the faculty club last
needed money: (on yes, we for-
got to tell you, the proceeds will
go to the facility club.)

Tlckcls Will be on sale Monday
in the corridor between the lie
bi-ai-y and the Alumni Recintion
hall from 9 am to 12:15 pm
and at Large's pharmacy Tues-
day from 10 a.m. to 4 pm.

 

Changes in the Student Council

student referendum, revision of the auditing system, and
ion on faculty committees.

on of the constitution will permit more coordination be

tween the Student Council and the various campus organizations and
i-tassures a better representation of

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK ‘

NUMBER 42

Revised Constitution Up for
Ratification at Housemee’rings;

eks Coordination

constitution will be pre-
onday night for ratification.
exccu 've committee, provision for
student rep-

the student body, according to
Robert Moehl, president of the
council.

Instead of two representatives
on the chapel committee and two
members of thc pep committee,
there wnl be two women repre-
senting the student body at large.
President of the Council of House
Presidents and president of the
Women's League Board will serve
on the executive committee.

Both chapel and pep commit-
tees will be appointed sub-coin-
mittees of the executive com-
mittec.

President of the Women's Ath-
letic Association is added to the
council as an exaofficio member.

Election of two women repre
senting the student body at large
will be held by popular vote at
the time of the election of the
president of the council.

Provl on has been made to
give the Student Council the
right to petition the Board of
Trustees with the sanction of the
faculty.

The revised constitution pro-
vides for student representation
on faculty committees concerning
the welfare of the student body.

Amendment to the constitution
of the student council is to be
made by a two-thirds vote of the
council with the approval of the
faculty. Arrangements were made
to pro dc for a student refer-
endum.

The white House committee
would now he a subcommittee
to the executive committee. At the
time of the drafting of the pre-
sent cnristitution, the White House
did not exist.

Mcmbership of the recreation
committee is enlarged to include
the White House committee chair-
man and the quadrangle social
chairman. The powers of the
committee , expanded to in-
clude acti cs other than danc-
ing.

Formation of the new publica-
tions hoard makes necessary a
provision for representation of
the student Council on this board.

The student auditing system is
revised according to the suggest-
ions of past student auditors.
While the powers and ,duties of
the auditor are not limited or
changed by the revision, the sy»
stem has been unified and rcgu.
latioi-s drawn up calling for a
tightening of auditing methods of
organizations under the jurisdic—
tion of the council, Moehi said.
