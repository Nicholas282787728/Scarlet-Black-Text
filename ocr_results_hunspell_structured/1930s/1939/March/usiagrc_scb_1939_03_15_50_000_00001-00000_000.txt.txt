boycott in silk alone would bc
very effective, for 90 per cent of
Japan's silk goes to the United
States. Also American workers
would not be put out of work,
for various silk substitutes are
already being put on the market.
If America, Great Britain, Hol-
land, ond Franco would cooperate
on an embargo on Japan, it would
force Japan to stop the war in
three months, Lattimore said.
”Our foreign policy will be gov-
ernccl by conditions in the United
states," Lattuncre stated, “just
as Japan's policy in China is a
result of conditions in Japan."
Lattimore then told of our
heavy business interests in Japan
and how they would resist an em»
bargo ol' boycott. This should not
deter us from our program, for

no matter what policy we take it
will mean increased control of
piivate business by the public for
the public good.

A similar policy, according to
Lattimore, of embargo and boy—
cott should be placed on Italy and
Germany. Such a policy of is-
sisting the aggressor nations will
diminish the danger of war.

The dictator nations are in a
grcat state of unbalance and are
'lulpl'epa‘ed for a long war, Latti-

A resistance policy
would also help decrease the
popularity of Hitler and Mussor
lini, and any policy that discredits
the dictators will aid the Gere
mans and Italians to get rid of
them. Thus we will_be assisting
ltaly and Germany to get back
to democratic standards.

Figures Show 86'7"
of Students and
Faculty Not Going

An iliclease of 45.4 pol cent

of the student body and fac-
ulty attending daily chapel, since

the beginning of the Scarlet and
Black's editorial campaign on Feb.
22, was reported today by the
editorial board of the newspaper.

Before starting the drive. the
average daily chapel attendance
of students and faculty figured at
79.8,
sreiuly Increasei

Attendance has been steadily
increasing, according to those
making the survey. Including yes-
terday’s attendance, the average
for students and faculty now
amounts to 116.1,

Before the drive started. about
9.3 per cent of the entire student
body and faculty attended daily
chapel. This has now been built
up to a daily average of 13.6 per
cent of the entire student body
and faculty.

Room for improvement

According to Blaine Hays, edi-
torial director of the Scarlet and
Black, there is yet plenty of room
for improvement.

“The most encouraging feature
of the Situation," Hays said to-
day, “is the 45.4 per cent increase
of the number of people in chapel
every day. This figure, however,
is in great contrast to the low
figure of 4.3 per cent. which rep—
resents the small increase in the
total number of students and fac-
ulty attending the chapel services
Sci-oral Changes Planned.

”While the number of students
attending chapel remains very
much below any desirable figure,"
he explained, “we are deeply ap-
preciative and grateful for the in.
terest shown by the students thus
far, The committee is now work-
ing on several changes in chapel
programs which we hope will
make for an all—around improve-
ment in the daily services."

He stated that it is very en-
couraging to the committee to
feel that students are actually
behind chapel as much as they
are.

Attendance Calculation.

“We sincerely hope,“ Hays said,
“that the attendance figures \nll
continue to go up,"

The following calculations shows
the steady chapel increase:
