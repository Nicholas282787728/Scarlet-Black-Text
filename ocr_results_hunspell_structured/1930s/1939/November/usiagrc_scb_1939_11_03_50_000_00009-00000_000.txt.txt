Grinnell first became football
conscious in 1333 when Professor
Joseph Torrey, Jr,, attempted to
introduce the game at Grinnell.
However, none of the undergrad-
uates had ever witnessed a
game and the professor had cone
fined his participation to "spec-

.tating,” and therefore the at-
tempt fell flatter than a football
cheer in the fourth quarter.

In 1339, two New Jersey lads
enrolled at Grinnell, bringing the
game with them, and after as-
sembling eleven or more men at
the chapel, no small feat in it-
self these days, succeeded in
arousing sufficient interest to or-
ganizc a team.

The manager of the group,
mysteriously referred to as
Wright in college records, then
set about arranging a game with
s. U. I. and appointed a Commit
