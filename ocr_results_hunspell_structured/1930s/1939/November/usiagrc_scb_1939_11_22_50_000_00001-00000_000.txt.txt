Light Is Thrown
On Iowa Room’ s
Chinese Lamp

ls Grinnell-s light buried under a
stack of books?

Now that is a question that
has more than once been raised
by the intellectuals and the stu-
dents of Grinnell. But even in
spite of numerous articles being
published last year as to Grin—
nell's place in the solar system,
the enigma remains, Even the
social committee is wondering,

What raises the question this
time, though, is a sight that
greets the eyes of the library
wanderer who makes his way in-
to the Iowa room, far down in
the piles of print and paper
among the dust to dust of the
Scarlet and Blacks. For there in
between the files is a little glass
Case. And in the little glass case
is a. little Old lamp. And beside
me lamp is a little White card
that says, “The Chinese burn
bean oil in this lamp as their
chief means of illumination."

Many things could be said
about beans and their 0y-
products as a means of illumina-
tion. But what we Want to know
is “Is this little lamp from China
the solution to all the fast flick-
ering lights in Grinnell?”

Lack of Airport at Grinnell Seen as Primary Obstacle

To Securing a Civilian Aviation Training Program Here

 

By Clyde Bates.

"The primary obstacle in the way
of establishing the Civilian Pilot
Training program at Grinnell is
our lack of an airport," Grant 0.
Gale, associate professor of physr
ics, told a group or fifty-five men
(and one coed) last night in the
Clark hall clubroom.

Gale pointed out that the nears
est field to Grinnell is located in
Montezuma, 24 miles away. thus
presenting a transportation prob-
lem. “However, some solution
might be worked out if enough
students are interested," Gale
said.

“If we can get a field, the set-
up will be the same here as that
of other schools." Gale stated. He
went on to outline the training
program as sponsored by the civil

 

Aeronautical Authority, a govern—
ment prolect.

Two courses are being present—
ed, one in ground instruction, and
another in flight instruction. The
first course includes instruction
in navigation, meteorology. which
is a study of atmospheric condi-
tions, theory of flight, parachutes,
radio, and civil regulations.

The flight course covers com—
plete flight instruction from the
takeoff to stunting, according to
Gale. This requires a minimum
of 35 or amaximum of 50 hours
of actual flight, dual and solo.

The student who completes this
course may then apply for his
private pilot’s license.

The cost of the course was par—
ticularly stressed by Ray Gustafr
son and Robert Hall, students

with some flying experience, who
informed the group that regular
flying instruction costs from $5.00
to $7.50 per hour, whereas under
the desired program each student
will be charged only $40, this sum
to include insurance and equip-
ment.

Though the flight instructor is
to be appointed by the govern»
ment with the approval of the
institution, Gale pointed out that
this training program is not a
part of the military program. It

by the same funds as the N. Y.
A.

“However, because the ground
course must start the first se~
mester of the year, we are too
late to get the training course

Monday afternoon, The oc-

Speaking of the small turnout

The biggest cheer that arose
from the stands during the entire

game, they both declared, was when

spectators learned by means of
portable radios that Iowa univer-
sity had scored a touchdown
against Minnesota.

Lookabaugh claimed that the
Gee-Grinnell game was fully as
important in the Mid-West con-
ference. as was the Iowa»Minne-
sota encounter in the Big Ten.
“The Grinnell victory was fully as
amazing as Iowa's if the records
were to be compared,” he said.
