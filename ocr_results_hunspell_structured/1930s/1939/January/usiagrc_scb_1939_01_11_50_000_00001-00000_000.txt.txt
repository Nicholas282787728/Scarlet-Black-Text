Cagers Clash

Peisner, Turner
Praised for Good
Floor Work, Shots

By Clark A. Smith.
A tired and travel-weary Pioneer
basketball squad arrived in Grin-
nell yesterday afternoon and im-
mediately began to prepare for its
contest with the Iowa State
Teachers college Panthers, Friday
night in the men’s gymnasium.
The Pioneers whipped the
Panthers 52 to as at Cedar Falls
earlier in the season. it took a
“not" night to roll up such a
score against a Tutor team that
is to be highly respected. 1ndica-
tions are that the game Friday
night will develop into a much
closer contest as the Panthers
are in an avenging mood.
Ti-uesdale Pleased.

Coach John C. Truesdale was
both pleased and disappointed
with the showing of his cagers on
the recent road trip in which they
defeated Wasburn and Tulsa, but
lost to Oklahoma A. a M. “We
could have beaten the Aggies,"
the Pioneer mentor explained,
“but we were just too tired and
off in our shooting. The schedule
of two games in as many nights
with a hard road trip between,
was just too much for us."
New Weakness.

A new weakness has developed
in the team play that must be
watched, according to Truesdaie.
it is that the team is beginning
to rely too much on its ability to
hit the basket on long shots.

“The boys are forgetting to cut
for the basket and work the ball
in." he explained.

Praise for ’l\u-nel- snn Peisner.

Otherwise, the play of the team
on the trip was everything that
could be expected under the cir—
cumstances, Coach Truesdaie had
special praise for the play of
John Turner and Gene Peisner.

The floor play of his letter is
such that the Pioneer mentor is
comparing him with Julius Bauer
‘35 one of the most polished floor

men ever to play on n Grinnell
basketball team. Turner’s shoot-
ing has at times been sensational
and the little guard is proving to
be one of the main spark plugs
of the squad.

Pioneers Capable.

A rosy future is in store for
the team in the Missouri valley
conference race. The conviction
that the Pioneers are capable of
beating every team in the league
can be held without too much
doubt.

A hard fight for championship
honors lies ahead, but they can
get to the top if the pioneers con.
sistently play the brand of ball it
is known they are capable of

playing.
