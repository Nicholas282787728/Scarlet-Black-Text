FRANKFURTER AND MURPHY

To those who know the reality of President
Roosevelt’s liberalism, the appointment of
Professor Felix Frankfurter to the Supreme
bench and the appointment of fornler Gov-
ernor Frank Murphy of Michigan to the
attorney—generalship will come as no sur—
priser

It is pleasant to read ill most of the news
dispatches that both appointments will

probably be confirmed by the senate, al-
though there will no doubt be some grumb-

ling about Murphy and the sitdown strikes
and about Frankfurter and ”radicalism," a
term often used but never satisfactorily de—
fined by Representative Diesr

There is, of course, every reason why the
two men should be confirmed. No one has
ever questioned the honesty or the high
principles of either one. Both are well qual-
ified for their positions, and their qualifica-
tions should be of particular interest to col—
lege students. Both have impressive acad-
emic records: Mr. Frankfurter is a graduate
of the Harvard Law school; Mix Murphy's
L.L.B. is from the University of Michigan.
Both have been teachers, Mr, Frankfurter
as a professor at his alma mater; Mr. Mur—
phy as an instructor in law at the Univer-

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

sity of Detroit.

Both have the breadth of interest that
comes from all international background,
Mr Frankfurtel by bilth (he was born‘in
Vienna, Austlia, now Germany); Mr. Muls
phy by training and experience~he lead
law at Londons famed Lincoln’s Inn and
at Triiiity‘college, Dublin, and before be
coming governor of Michigan he was high
commissioner to the Phillipines.

Finally, both have a reputation for lib-
eralism, M . Frankfurter for his views on
the well-known Sacco-Vallzetti case, Mix
Murphy for his handling of the automobile
strike of last year. There is ever reason
to think that, if confirmed, Ml. Murphy
will be a distinguished and conscientious
attorney—general and Mr. Frankfurter a
worthy successor of hs predecessors, Mr.
Justice Holmes and Mix Justice Cardozo.

TOM MOONEY'S PARDON

Last Saturday the new governor of Cali-
fornia, Culbert Olson, fulfilled a campaign
promise by scttilig the state‘s most famous
prisoner free. He gave an unconditional
pardon to Tom Mooney, who has served 22
years behind bars for a crime which many

'claim he did not commit. Certain, it is that

someone planted a bomb that killed ten
people and injured 40 ill San Francisco on
July 22, 1916.

Today, in the minds of almost all the
people who were connected with the famous
trial that followed the bombing, it is equal-
ly certain that Mooney is absolutely inno-
cent. A man of some importance in the San
Francisco labor movement, he was, in the
words of the governor, “convicted solely
because he was hated by officialdom for his
radical activities.”

Now there is talk of the state of Califor-
nia appropriating $1,000,000 to pay Moons
ey, in some measure, fol the 22 years that
it has taken out of his life. Although this
amount is perhapstoo high, no one can feel
that justice has been satisfied by merely re-
leasing a man who has wrongly spent the
best years of his life in a cell. One thinks
of the Pr 1mm of Chillml, who spent only
six years in captivity. The comparison is
striking, if not perfect.

Be that as it may, Toln Mooney is free
at last. Labor claims his paldoii is its ti
unlph In this, labor is too exclusive. it is
the tliumph of something a very great deal
bigger than labol—iustice has been done
at last And the average American citizen
will leJOice because Califoulia has done a
gleat deal to heal all old wound

The act comes as a buist of light to a
world increasingly darkened by injustice
and by bitter strife.

OPEN FORUM

 

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr, Rowley.

The editorial in your last issuc
packed a real wollop, even if it
was in a velvet glove. Thc ques-
tion in most of our minds for a
number of years, however, has
not been “15 Ci-inncii Slipping,”
but rather, how long is she to
continue to do so,

It is rather disheartening for
most of us to sec OTHER schools
expanding, erecting new buildings,
introducing new educational ideas,
and generally looking into the fur
turs, while thc most that Grill—
hell can do is to summon up an
ever more sti-aiiiod remembrance
of things past, while slowly Wears
ing out the foundation of an edi-
{ice so painstakingly erected by
man of Vision and ideas:

—Robert Hagan.

Editor's Note: We are glad to
print the following statement
of correction regarding the ac-
tion taken Dec. 14 by the board
of trustees However, it is still
thc opinion of the Scarlet and
Black that we are no nearer a
solution of the problem facing ,
usr Until some alternate plan

is proposed, we see no means
whereby every student can so.
cure on annual each year under
the same system that assures
him other student privileges
under thc “all inclusive fee."

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

According to the official re-
port of the board of trustees sent
to the committee on publications
of the Student Council, the action
of that boalﬂ in regard to the
proposed publications plan was as
follows:

"After a full report on the

student activities in connects

ion with this publication
which contemplates an addir
ticn of $5 to the all inclusive
fee to provide each and every
student With a junior annual
and the Scarlet and Black, it
was moved and carried that
it be the sense of this board
that it is unwise to add $5
to our all inclusive fee for
this publication at this time.

The report disclosed that the

students had voted heavily in

favor of the procedure . . I

This is in contrast to your newsl
story in Saturday's issue of the
Scarlet and Black, which stated
that the board had voted dawn
“the proposed expansion of the
student board of publications and
the accompanying financial plan."

As the above report indicates,
the financial plan was acted upon
negatively, but the board did not
take any official action eithEr afr
firmatively or nsgativeiy in re»
gard to the “expansion of the
board.“

The result of the action by the
board of trustcss was to make
no suggestion, officially, except in
regard to the $5 fee,

—nobert Schutt,
Chairman, Student Council
Committee on Publications.

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

it is heartening to see the in—
terest which was stirred on our
campus by last week's editorial,
“Is Grinnell Slipping?” The ques
tion is a legitimate one, and one
raised not without provocation.

The problem cannot be ap-
proached either solely from the
student's standpoint nor solely
from the standpoint of the admins
istrntion. It is our common prob-
lem, and each of us must undci»
stand the other and cooperate in
order to solve it,

Is Crinnell slipping? in sonic
ways, yes, In othsr and more

 

ways it certainly is not.

i, A Grinnell education in terms
of its after-college value has in-
creased “'1 worth by whatever
standard you wish to measurc

2. Our athletic teams do show
increased strength and spirit and
our intramural program expanded
still further this year,

3. Though an adequate student
union was kept out of reach by
prcscnt economic conditions, the
administration gave us, last year,
a temporary student center, the
White House.

4. Those who are familiar with
the Harvard exchange say that
the month-long visit on our
campus of an unquestioned auth-
ority on vital international at.
fairs is a superior substitute for
the former visits of Harvard pro—
fesscrs.

5. Our glee Club is not as fa-
mous as it used to be. That is
regrettable. Let us hope that its
present leader will fill its mem-
bers with the kind of spirit that
has won ncw acclaim for our
band. It is significant that this

,pnst year has found more of OH]
’students

in organized singing
groups than at any time in Grin-
nell history.

6. Grinnell has certainly dis-
tinguished itself through its pio-
neering effort to develop a system
of vocational guidance and grad-
uate placement. This program is
young and incomplete, but each
year finds its effectiveness in-
creased.

Wc need not be ashamed of our
College!

At the same time, the progress-
ive spirit on our campus is not
as hearty as it could and should
be. Many of us were greatly dis-
appointed by the trustees‘ rejec-
tion of the financial part of the
plan for reorganization of student

! publications.

However, to close the subject '
by su gesting that the trustees
on this issue are unsympathetic
to our problem, and for that rea-
on not progressive, is to admit
that we are not sufficiently con-
Vinced of the worthwhilencss of
our plan to continue to fight for
its adoption.

The plan is not lost uiitil Llle
student body gives it up, That it
must not do.

is Grinnell drifting? How? And
why? It is extremely unfortunate
that our president has been drawn
away from more intimate partici-
pation in our day-by-day campus
life by the odious task of solicits
ing funds which our college
needs, not only to keep it from
drifting, but to build foundations
under the administration's pro-
gram for raising still higher the
standard of our education.

President Noilen's plans for
Grinnell, such as that for the
establishing of a school of public
affairs, have not been shared with

lus. Or perhaps we have missed

thcm by not attending chapel
when he has Spoken, And per
haps we have not given him the
chance to jam us informally at
dinner and in our rooms, We only
invite him at Christmas

True, part of the responsibility
is ours, but not all of it. The stu
dent body, with the help of the
scarlet iiml Black, has exprosscd
vigorously the step: it believes
will contribute to the making of
a better Ci-inns . And while there
are things, such as needed im-
movements in certain depart-
ments, with which the president
alone can deal, there are plans
and ideals for Gi‘innell which he
has not made known to us,

We have faith in Grinnell. We
are interested in the plans our
president has for Grinnell's fu-
me, And we want to lend our
support for their realizatioii-—to
show that Grinnell is not sii .
ping.
