I oun WELCOME

Unfriendly though it may seem, the Scarlet
and Black this year wishes to greet new
students and old with a definition of the
place where they are to spend the next eight
or nine months “in a society possessing cer-
tain powers and rights and engaged in some
common pursuit." To most of us, perhaps,
college is like a walkathon, we try to last as
long aspossible with as little effort as pos
sible, thus working toward a sheepskin test-
ifying toward our durability rather than
our accomplishments,

In Grinnell, as in every college and uni-
versity in America, there are always those
who have no desire to pursue a course of
serious study, but rather puncture all of
their four years of opportunity with fre«
quent appearances on the carpet as the re-
sult of lambasting the last inch of privilege
out of an often too tolerant system of stu-
dent government.

To new students, then, we have this ad«
vice to offe In college, as in no other
place, you will have a golden opportunity
to make yourself useless. If there are not
enough “rounders” among you, there are
always plenty of upperclassl‘nen to offer
you experienced and able assistance

For every privilege that you are offered
at Grinnell, and there are many of them,
you have an obligation to the college as a
living spirit, to the student government,
and, if you choose, to yourself.

HOME STRETCH

For about one hundred and fifty of us stu-
dents, September 21 marks the beginning
of the home stretch. Most of us have made
errors; a few of us have, after long con-
ferences by the curriculum committee, been
“walked"; some of us have stolen bases.
Anyway, here we are, ready for the last
dash that will leave us just where we were

four years ago, with a graduation behind
us and a new experience before us.

Have we changed any? Probably we look
about the same; at least our mothers still
recognize us, ill spite of radical improve-
ments in our appearance like a different
hair style or a pretty scarlet sweater with a
black ”G” on it. But college, we have al—
ways heard, is supposed to broaden us. Alld
we aren‘t referring to the extra pounds the
freshmen take home with them at Christ,-
mastime. We are referring to a few words
used glibly and often meaniliglcssly when—
ever the opportunities of college are dis-
cussed, words like “intellectually,” ”social-
ly,” and "sympathetically.” Of course we
have practically all had to read the Aeneid
and perhaps part of Acreapugltico for a re-
quired English course; but that doesn’t
guarantee that we are now cultured. Have
our intellects been stimulated so that we will
enjoy doing a little studying on our own
and will read more than “Esquire,” the
“Saturday Evening Post,” and the most-
read novel of the year, after we have been
graduated?

And socially, are we any more broad?
Besides learning to sling the hull with the
fellows or girls on our own floor, are we
any more at ease in a large social group
than we were at the General Reception on
the first Saturday night of our freshman

year? Have we learned respect for greaterl

wisdom and experience than our own?
Sympathetically, are we broad enough to
accept every person for himself, and not to
be subject to the racial prejudices of our to
talitarian neighbor states? Can we be
whole-healtedly interested ill persons and
things not directly conceming ourselves?
May there be many hits and few foul
balls among the class of ’40.

CHAPEL’S CHALLENGE

Oh College, fairest of our dreams,
As now on us subdued, there beams
The golden-tinted past,
We wonder on thin campus ways
Where poet men in lily-gone days
Dreamed golden dreams, ’nealh win-
try greys,
And built them sure and first.
The doors of Herrick Chapel stand open to
welcome new students, old students, faculty
fall who wish to accept what it has to
offer.
voluntary. Consequently, each member of
the student body and faculty will soon de-
cide whether or not he wishes to attend
daily Chapel. What will it have to offer?

Chapel offers an opportunity for students
and faculty to come together and commune
together on a different plane than in the
everyday classroom relationship. It fur—
uishes opportunity for meditation, “As now
on us subdued, there beams the golden-
tinted past." Chapel offers inspiration and
stimulation of ideas and ideals, “Where poet
men in by-gone days Dreamed golden
dreams . . . And built them sure and fast,”
and where we may drezun and plan for a
golden—tinted future of our own.

Chapel is the center of the religious life
of Grinnell College, and an important part
of the liberal arts program, since it offers
the opportunity to learn about relationships
to ourselves of those about us, of the uni-
verse as a whole, and of God.

Chapel has as much to offer as We wish
to accept. its doors are open, and through
them we may find the “College fairest of
our dreams."
