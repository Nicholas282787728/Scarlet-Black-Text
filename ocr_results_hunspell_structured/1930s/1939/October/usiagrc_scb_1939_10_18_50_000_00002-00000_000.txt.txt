HELL WEEK

What does Hell Week mean at Grinnell? Is
it just a chance for the upperclassmen to
“take it out" on the preps, or does it have
some other meaning“.7 These questions must
be in the mind of every freshman as this
week-end approaches. They are also being
considered by many upperclassmen, who, 31‘
though they‘have all been through Hell
Week' before, often have very indefinite
ideas of what it’s all about. The two follow-

ing editorials seek to explain this Grinnell'

tradition - from different angles.

TO THE UPPEBCLASSMEN

Any attempt to assign a “higher purpose”
Or a “deep significance” to Hell Week is apt
to be met with laughter by most upperclass»
men. This is, after all, a healthy attitude.
No one can honestly deny that one of the
main purposes‘ of any form of hazing is to
have a little fun at the expense of the fresh-
men. There is no harm in having this mo—
tive, only it must not be run into the ground
When the freshmen begin to suffer physi-
cally, then someone‘s idea of a joke is being
carried too far. It is often rather difficult
to know where to draw the line between
harmless pranks and actual torture. In a
few cases in the past, such a line was not
drawn. Everyone concerned has suffered
whenever this has happened. The results
are always the same. The freshmen become
justly angry with the upperclassmen, and
any kind of hall spirit that might have
been promoted during Hell Week vanishes.
The upperclassmen, if they stick together,
throw their moral support to the fellow who
was foolish enough to cause the trouble in
the first place. The administration either
protests, or makes new rules taking more
privileges away from the student body as a
whole, or both. Nobody wins when hazing
is carried too far.

Most of us come to college for a variety
of reasons, one of the most important of
which is to learn how to get along with the
other fellow. We all usually get along fair-
ly well with those who have authority over
us. We have to. The real test comes when
we have authority over someone else. This
situation brings out the worst in a few
people. They get drunk with power and
develop a kind of Hitler complex. These
“little Caesars" make life miserable for
those under their authority in order to bol-
ster up their ego, The fellows who com-
mand respect for what they are on the cam-
pus are not to he found in this class. It is

only the fellows who don’t amount to any-
thing in the first place who let the tem-
porary advantage that their
upperclassmen gives them go to their heads.
Once in a while this element gets control of
Hell Week activity in some hall. When this
happens, Hell Week is misnztlned. It should
then be called Heel Week. As uppercluss-
men, let’s use our influence to keep the heels
out of Hell Week activities.

The Hell Week program is one of the few
on the campus in which the halls participate
as halls. Everybody is in on it, freshmen,
upperclassmen, transfers, and associates.
Therefore it follows that Hell Week offers
an unparalleled opportunity to develop hall
unity, to get more intimately acquainted
with all the new men, both freshmen and
transfers, and to have a lot of fun in a group
activity. This is the constructive side of
Hell Week. Let’s keep it in mind.

To sum it all up, hazing is not a paltir
cularly noble activity, but it’s human and
it’s fun. When it is kept within reasonable
limits, it needs no other apology. It is now,
and it always has been, an opportunity and
a challenge to the upperclassmen of Grin»
llell.

TO THE PREPS 7

Once upon a time there was a group of
mules who lived together on a farm rlln by
former Brolvn. These mules had not lived
on this farm all their life, but all had come
there a month before this story takes place.
They were not quite full grown mules and
had never done much on their own, but
they had to work. For the first month
farmer Brown fed them and required very
little from them, but one day we decided to
try out the mules on a long trip to town.
He harnessed them up and started out with
his load. When put to this test the mules
did not all act in the same way.

Now there were a few mules who had
grown up on farms where they hadbeen
very well treated so that they never had
pulled a wagon before. Furthermore, they
saw no reason why they should start now
just because farmer Brown told them to.
They.decided that they just wouldn’t go.
Farmé'r Brown just shook his head, got out
his whip, and gave them a good crack.
These stubborn mules begrudgingly started
out but stopped every once in a while.
Every time they stopped they were whipped
so that when they finally staggered into
town they were sore all over.

One mule acted in a very different mam
ner. He thought that he would be smart
and fool the farmer. He pretended that he
was doing his pait and pulling the wagon,
but every time he got a chance he would
just walk along and let the other mules do

Gﬁ

the work. He got out of doing the work .

all right but he didn’t fool the other mules.

The majority of the mules, howaver,
realized that their position, at least tem-
porarily, was that of a work animal and
that there was nothing they could do about
it. They didn’t want to pull the wagon any
more than the other mules, but they knew
they had to and therefore made the best of
it. When they got to town they were very
tired but they weren’t sore all over and
they were not disliked by the other mules
because of cheating or laying down on the
job. Furthermore they discovered, when
they looked back over the' trip, that they
hzldn't had such a bad time after all. They
had seen a lot of new territory, learned
what they themselves could do when put to
a test, learned to know each other much
better, and most important of all, they had
earned the respect of farmer Brown.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
{By Associated Collegiate Press)

“A knowing kind of citizenry does not fall
for the same old shibboleths. If the major»
ity of the people are ruled by hate or in
tolerance or blind impulse, democracy will
destroy itself. Obviously, the collective \vis
dom can rise no higher than the education
and character of the individuals who make
up the state." Dean John T. Madden of
New York University believes that the ills
dividuals of the nation should possess
greater knowledge and the capacity to act
on that knowledge.
