Max Shelton
Explains Acl

Honor ‘G’ President
Cites Group's Vt’oi'lt
In Aiding Attendance

By Ken Mathews.

In an announcement posted on all
dormitory bulletin boards Sunday
evening, Max Shelton, president
of the Honor “(3" club, Stated
the organization's ruling requiring
the attendance of all freshmen at
chapel this week and all the fair
lowing weeks this year

In a statement to the Scarlet
and Black, Shelton explained the
club’s action as follows: "At the
request of the President and the
Dean of Men, the Honor “G” club
was urged to do something to
stimulate freshman attendance at
chapel.

Shelton Statement

“These offi ials seemed to fear
that the tradition of ‘buttoning'
was causing the freshmen to re-
fuse 90 run the gauntlet of Honor
‘0 men and other iipperclassmen
between the ARH and chapel, and
they suggested we do something
about it, So we did!"

This is in line with the club's
effort to support chapel by in
creased attendance of members
and furnishing of ushers at the
service, Shelton concluded.
opinions Given

Opinions of administration, fa»
culty, and student leaders on the
ruling include the following:
Pres. .yohii si Nollen: “I consider
that chapel and vespers are im-
portant parts of college, and am
in favor of anything that can be
done to encourage both upper-
elassmen and freshmen to attend
the services, However, 1 do not
like the idea of compulsion."

When asked to give a statement
regarding the gamut of “button”
shouting upperciassmeo stationed
in front of the library before
chapel eyery morning, Pres, Nol-
lcn called the custom foolish, in
that it discourages freshman at-
tendance at chapel.

Shelton L. neutty, dean of men:
“Praise to the men‘s and Women's
government and to the Student
Council, to the Y's, Honor ‘G,’
and all other student leaders who
have been making a most effec-
tive contribution to some of the
finest college spirit 1 have seen
in Grinnell these ten years. The
best enforcement that the ‘Honor
G‘ and all other upperclassmen
can give to the constructive pol—
icy of Honor ‘G‘ in asking fresh-
men to attend chapel is to come
with the freshmen in person. 1
hope that the freshmen will co-
operate with Honor ‘0’ in per
feet spirit, without any feeling of
compulsion, and with the knowh
edge in their hearts that they are
contributing personally to the
making of a stronger and finer
Grinncll unity here and now.”
Edward A. Steiner, Rand profes»
sor of applied christianit: “I
have often thought such an action
would be worth a trial, to de
termine what cftect it would have
on the spirit of chapel."

William Pcdersen,
the student Council: “Chapel is
an institution on this campus
which everyone should want to
attend, but the inclination should

'lthout."

Ii y Kie'd, prcsident of the Coun-
cil of House Prcsidrnts. “Compuh
sion of any soit defouts the whole
purpose of chapel,"

nelrn renter-son, ch non of the
Student Council chapel connnlt-
lee: “We liked to think that our
programs are worthy of attend-
incc without compulsion, but we

is backing us."

A COLUMN OF PURE

There comes a time in the life of

while we give rent to a few legie

Grinnell the Pure takes another
step forward with the announce
ment that the band boys and
gals will ride to thc Drakc affair
in SEPARATE conveyances. Pose
sibly the higher-ups are afraid of
auto-intoxication It's the only
reason we can see for such a 1'67
lapse into seminary daze.

Va ety may he the spice of life
but it'd be nice, too, if the quad
timing room service got itself or-
ganizcd before Colmlienccment.

Is it possible that a twinge of
conscience lies behind the Honor
“G" chapel roundup? Sancti-
moniously sending the preps to
chapel is one way of atoning for
engaging in the ready-to-wcar
business (again) before the meme
