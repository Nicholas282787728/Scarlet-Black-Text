kicking of Harry Barker and

In Senior Ballot'

Lost were the thirty and nine,
submerged in the mists of the
seminary.

Monday night the senior class
gave a dinner, and at some tables
there were two men, but mostly
there weren't. The grace went
without a thrilling bass. The men
were afraid to sing. Feminine
chatter ebbed beneath the arched
rafters. The men were afraid to
talk. The men were afraid to eat.
One man asked for a second glass
of water.

Then came the revolution as in
all good tragedies there must.
Men and women gathered in the
little theater for the class meet—
ing, and all the best seats were
taken by the men. The mists dis—
Solved. The seminary disbanded.
The male element forgot to quiv~
er. All thirty and nine raised up
their voices and voweled, “Hol—
quist for president.” The motion
was made and seconded twenty
times while Kies made a feeble
attempt to recall Robert’s Rules
of Order. Women were nominate
ed midst many bronx cheers. But
alas! the votei39 for Holquist.

Campus Survey Shows Only 19% of Men Willing to Fight
In Europe; ‘Save Democracy’ Held Insufficientfor War

 

By Ken Mathews.
Only 19% of the men in Crinnell
college would be willing to fight
in the war now raging inEurope,
according to a poll taken on the
campus this week.

Wondering how the student
body of Gl'innell felt in regard to
the U. S. policy on some of the
phases of the European war, the
Scarlet and Black conducted an
informal survey of some 200 men
on the campus. The survey cons
sisted of seven questions, which
were answered yes or no by men,
most of whom are vitally inter-
ested (many being first draft
material), in whether the U. S.
will be drawn into the conflict.

Results obtained showed that
the average male Crinnellian
needs a much better cause than
“preserving democracy" in Eur—
ope before he will be Willing to
engage in modern warfare.

Beginning with an even 50%
disagreement on whether the
present arms embargo should be
repealed or not; 23% felt that
they would Volunteer if the Unit-
ed States declared war, The mac
jor reason advanced by this
group for its stand was the prob-
ability of being able to get into‘
any line of service they desired.

Asked whether they would re—
fuse to serve in a war abroad,
[even if it meant imprisonment,

34% answered with a definite
yes. The closest agreement was
reached when 945% said they
would not consider the sinkingof
unarmed American ships with
American passengers aboard Suf-
ficient cause for the declaration
of war. Most of the men felt
that such passengers had no
right to demand U. S‘. protection
on the high seas in time of war.

Oneceighth of the men quizzed
declared they would not want to
fight in the event that U. S. ter-
ritories were attacked. On the
continuing of the Monroe doc—
trine, a decided 58% were not
ready to defend other countries
in the Western Hemisphere,
