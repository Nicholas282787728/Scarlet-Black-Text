LET FIRST THINGS COME FIRST

On a few occasio'ns during the year Grill-
nell students publicly proclaim and applaud
the ”love of wisdom as the guide of life.”
Two of the most important occasions for
such applauding are those in which the few
students who have shown outstanding in-
tellectual and moral accomplishment are
given their celtificates of membership in
Phi Beta Kappa. There isn't ally college
worthy of the name that does not desire to
inculcate in its students all the intellectual
and moral qualities they are capable of ac-
quiring. Grillllell has a superb reputation
to maintain, and its students for the most
part are imbued with the “Grinnell Spirit,"
a spirit founded ill the moral and intellectual
virtues of its builders and its succeeding
generations of students.

Thursday morning in chapel, Roy H.
Perl'ing, professor of German, introduced
the newly elected members of Phi Beta Kap-
pa; and a large gathering of students en—
thusiastically greeted them, signifying their
approval of Phi Beta Kappa‘s ideals and the
'sdlccless of a few students in meeting those
1 ea S.

Thursday evening at dinner in the men’s
dining room a freshman whose scholastic
work to date has been abominably low was
willing to bet that he’d be at Grinnell for
three more years of “fooling around," and
that he came to college not to secure an
education, but to have a good time.

There we have a contrast, a group of
students aspiring to the highest ideals of
moral and intellectual life, and another
group represented by the freshman whose
only desire is to waste his time by “fooling
around.” The fomrler have learned that
first things should come first. The latter
has still time to grow up.

FACULTY KUDOS

The other day Professor Raymond Benedict
McClenon of Grinnell college was elected
president of the lowa Academy of Sciencc,
The event was important enough to merit
being mentioned during a news broadcast;
however it is likely that the outside world
knew of it before Mr. McClenon’s students
themselves did. Here is but another indica-
tion of the too often apathetic isolation of
college students.

Last fall we were gradually awakened to
the fact that our own Professor Payne had
published a biography—and not a stuffy
abstruse affair, of interest only to histor-
ians, either, but an entertaining and well-
writtcll account of a significant personal—
ity. Some of us may even have got around
to reading it.

We hear now and then, vaguely, of books
by Paul Spencer Wood, or of mosses newly
classified by Henry S. Collard, or of Miss
Sternfeld’s having been recognized for her
water colors, But we scarcely take time to
be surprised at the accomplishments of
members of the faculty, or at the esteem
in which they are held outside the campus.
of course, we respect our instructors. But
too often we take their worth for granted.
We come to class—or we don’tAand pas—
sively lap up the edification afforded us, or,
what is almost worse, we merely find more
to complain about.

There is not much point in instituting an
orgy of bouque slingillginobody wants
that. But Grinnell students might well be
more alert to the opportunities they so
zlpathetically accept.

——G——
A GRINNELL COMMONWEALTH

To lls on the campus the idea of a Grimlell
Commonwealth composed of students, alume
lli, faculty and friends of the college, all
working for its advancement, may seem to
be a beautiful but unattainable ideal. Know—
illg that high hopes and high ideals some»
times vanish like mirages as we attempt to
approach them ill a practical way, we may
easily become cynical about the practical
values of such a commonwealth.

But the annual alumni banquet held in
the quadrangle dining room on April 20
should cause us to take heart. Four hun—
dred Gl'ilinellians, alumni from the year
1886 down to the present, members of the
current student body, faculty members old
and young, and townspeople whose only
connection with the college is a bond of
sympathetic interest and lively enthusiasm,
met on that occasion to eat and visit to—
gether, and by those actions to build
stronger the spirit of Grinnell.

To the administration which has committ-
ed itself to the ideal of a Grinnell Com-
monwealth, to Robert Y. Kerr, executive
secretary, whose task is the spreading of
the commonwealth idea, to Frank F. Clin~
dinin, exrpl‘esidellt of the local alumni asso-
ciation who promoted the banquet, to Frank
Lynch who planned the program, to all
who attended the meeting belong credit for
the success of this valuable experience of
“organized friendship."

To those who have accepted the idea of a
“slipping Grinllell" the “commonwealth” of—
fers a challenge. All of us, if willing to co—
operate, can find a promise that through
the commonwealth ideal Grinnell can and
will achieve new levels of excellence

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor of the

SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Adams:

The Lecture Course wishes to
commend the Scarlct snd BlaCk
for interest in the College Lecture
Course shown in its editorial of
the April 22 issue entitled “Light
on the subject." We hopc that it
will start much discussion and on-
ly regret that something like it
could not have come csrlier. in
the season.

Can not some sounding of stu-
dent sentiment be taken? Arc we
to believe that the two-thirds of
the student body that came to see
Tsrbell is the some majority of
our student body that generally
does not come, whenever the
course is represented by some na-
tional or world figure in art, le -
ters or science? Adding to the
problem 15 the fact that very lit:
tle advertising was given Tarbell's
pal-formal'mc, while we make every
effort to get the students out for
other events. Mr. Tarbell
mented on the cnthusissm of this
audience and ‘said he believed it
greater than on the occasion of
his visit here seven or eight years
ago. Does thst mean Grinncll stu
dents are less conscious now of
cultural objectives?

If the lighting fixtures at Tcr-
bell's performance belong to Tai-
bcll, he must have left thcm here
on his prcvious visit. rm afraid
it will be necessary to give some
credit to campus resources for
the lighting arrangements ct his
showlng.

—F. L. Baunmnn,
Chairman of the Lecture
Course Committee.

To the Editor of thc
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Adsms:
During the past year, the Scarlet
and Black sponsored a campaign
for increasing the attendance at
our daily chapel programs. Thc
Scarlet & Black staff is to be con—
gratulated for the way it has
made the students of this campus
“Chapelvniinded.”

However, there has been some-

uung lacking in the majority of,

the programs that we have had

help, and a feeling that what is
hcppcning in other countries is of
importance here. However,
it is impossible to shske off the
feeling that the Changes in the
author's views are clue in part at
least to changes in the attitude
of America toward her. It has
accepted her as s writer, landed

and befriended her, therefore shel

ccccpts America.

Perhaps this is a partly unfair
criticism; surely it should not he
the only one. In spite of the too
insistent striking of the personal
note in a work which tries to pic-
ture a nation and the often too
obvious attempt to form flnc»
sounding phrases, a large share
of the hook is fascinating and
amusing, even stirring, Miss Brits
tam in real life is not only a
novelist; she is c worker in Eng-
land's Woman's Party and an
ardent pac' ‘st, admirable and un-
swcrving in her persecution of
war. The glimpses we see of that
side of her career and its relation
to the American people make us
wish she had stressed it more
and the inconveniences of lecture
tours less.

Thc occasional unfmlnded gen-
el‘allzations, inconsistencies, and
overdiasty conclusions are object-
ionahlc; but an excellent facility
of observation and an apparently
sincere feeling of purpose make
“Thrice a Stranger” informative,
progressive, and earnest, and,
what is perhaps most important.
consistently readable and enter»
taining.

4cm. Powell,

com-

this year. I believe, as I am sure
many other students on this cam-
pus do, that we should make our
chapel is sacred place and not an
audltorium. We come to college to
be instructed in the fine arts.
The majority of the subjects
trestcd m the chapel during the
last year hsvc been of an ex-
positol'y nature. Very few of the
programs have served the purpose
for which they were intended—-
giving the student c break in his
daily mental activities.

Now that the students have be~
come “Chapel—minded," wouldn't
it be a. good ides to direct that
spirit in the right direction? A
good chaplain in this school would
hsve just us much drawing power,
even more than most of the
speakers that we have bad. In-
struction is fine in its place, but
its place is in the classroom and
not in the chapel. I am sure that
you would find the students ready
to cooperate with you in n cal-n-
pslgn to make our chapel a
chcpcl and not an auditorium.
