FOOTBALL WAKES UP

W'ard ﬁeld, so Long dormant under the Scp-
telnbcr moon, stepped into the public eye last night
in gala array. Tolligllt the gridiron will again be
in use, tllis time in its ﬁrst nigllt college football
contest, G'lnncll against Iowa Wesleyan. Thc
throng which viewed the high school contest last
night was indicative of the success which the night
game is to meet here.

The color of the afternoon game in tho autuunl
is to be lost. In its place is a new color, the
same game but with a dark background and bril-
liant lights, things which always appeal to a plce .
sure loving crowd. The sight of a brown oval spir»
ailing through the air is to be replaced by the
glimmer of a white football. The cheers of college
students will be augmented by tllc enthusiasm of
business men, who scarcely ,cvcr found time to
attend an afternoon conte. .

Night football has already proven s cccssful
in other cities. Representatives of Missou Valley
institutions have enthusiastically complimented
G llell on the installation of lights. The prolme
bility of success here was shown this week when
the stands ﬁlled for practice sessions. and wllcll tllc
high school entertained ‘an unprecedented throng
last night. May Grinnell college enjoy a similar
experience tonight,

NEW QUADRANGLE RULES.

That a woman by the time she reaches college
is a responsible human being, to bc tlustcd and
relied upon to behave ill a respectable manner, is
more and more becoming the policy of the woman’s
league board.

The recent change in rules is another step ill
the. dirt‘ tion laid out last spring when seniors were
allowed :l few extra minutes in the evening. The
woman of thc,quddrangle are no longer treatcll
as criminals who must be within locked doors at
the stroke of the gollg, but as human beings who
are subject to everyday accidents and common
mistakes.

The quadrangle will seem more like home to the
women this year for the reason that they won‘t
have,thc eternal fear of being a minute or two late.
Although a mother might say her daughter should
be in at tell, no drastic action would be taken if
she were a few minutes late, and with the house
mothers in each cottage and the new rules, the
quadrangle will have a happicr, more contented air.

of course such changes in rulcs as this will be in
force only as long as they are not abused, but to the
seniors and juniors who have known lnucll stricter
rules, this one seems very lenient. The women are
expected not to be late except ill rare instances,
but if they should get in aftcr the doors had closed
too many times, they will be Warned before they
are campuscd. Ill this way the students are given
every possible advantage, and the new women as
well as the old should appreciate just What sensible
rulcs Grinnell has.

The whole policy of the league board this year
seems to be one of understanding and sympathy.
The women of the quadrangle are put upon their
holler, and are cxpcctcd to live up to the rules all
the closer now that the board has done its part in
making them more lenient.

RUSSIA SELLS SHORT

Russia sold short 7,500,000 bushels a few days
ago. Wheat prices tlro pcd. Thcy dropped some
more on rumor of Rnsslall grain exportatiolls to
France. Secretary Hydc will investigate. The New
York Times quoted some Americans who feared in
the soviet move a plot to disorganizc capitalistic
countlics.

All of which shows clearly that the Union of
Socialist Soviet Republics can disturb the world
when it wants to. The union comprises the world ’s
largest single extent of territory under a single
government. It is the world’s most brilliant poli-
tical alld economic experiment since 1780, and is
now scvcnth among America’s customers in value
of goods purchased.

Yet the state department refuses to recognize
this nation. The United States has no ofﬁcial rela-
tions with it, has no ofﬁcial information about it,

and has dcclillcd to discuss differences. Prcs
llcut lloovcr gives no indication that he will alter
this llnolulllous situation.

Meanwhile, the American people will not be
w sting tinlc ill watching the actions of the Soviets
during coming months and coming years.

FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE

In a recent chapel speech Prof. H. \V. Norl '
madc ll statclllcnt to the effect that college, cse
pccizllly thc first year, is an adventure ill frccdonl.

Most students on coming to college uctlou that
precept whcthcr they are accurately collsclons lot
it or not, and by their reaction to the situatloll
div lo thclnsolvcs into tum classes. One class To
mllticlllly bclicvcs itsclf absolutely frcc, only to
later rcillizc that there is no such thing as absolute
frccdoln or cvcn an approach to it.

The other class doesn’t realize the extent oi
its freedom and so neglects to procure for itself
a chart for thc ncu' waters. Actually each student
probably belongs to both these classes: ill and class
in sonic of his thinking and attitudes, and in tllc
other class in other habits of mind.

The real point is that. fcw grasp the situation
accurately. Chapel, vcspcrs, orientation courses,
and discussion groups on vocations are all intend-
cd to help the student understand the degree and
quality of his now freedom. and to assist him in

llg a goal and a sot of idcnls to {\lfl him in
adju ing to it most elfcctivcly.

None of’thcsc things, of course
to the student unless he l- li S Inc need for them,
but any student who dos to make the most. of
his college course, with the greatest economy of
effort, will try to really understand the situation
of which he has bccolne a part on clltcrillg college.
110 will draw on every available source of inspira-
tion and knowledge in an attempt to make the
most workable and most pleasant adjustment to
that situation.

PRESIDENT MAIN
(From the Des Moines Trlbnneoapitai)

With the reopening of college, that tall Obioan,
John Hanson Thomas Main, has started on the last lap
of a quarter century as president» of Griunell. Dr. Main
came to Grinnell as professor of Greek 38 years ago,
and next January he will complete his twentyllifth
year as administrative head of the institution.

During his presidency, the college has more than
doubled its building equipment, has grown in the num-
ber of its students and its faculty members, has in-
creased lts endowment, and has become known over a
wider area. Although like nearly all Iowa colleges,
Griunell has lost students in the last few years as
a result of economic depression and the rise of junior
colleges, the loss has been slight.

While the presidencies of some colleges and univer-
sities are going to men in their twenties. President
Main has retained a remarkable youthfnlness and vigor.
Although he will be 72 next April, he is still young
enough to sit through a football game in the rain and
to hob-nob with Gary Cooper.

president Main retains a physical and mental
sprightliness that makes him popular with both stud—
ents and faculty. In guiding Grinnell to the high posh
tion it holds today, he has set a record which his suc-
cessor will find it hard to duplicate.

AN EDITORIAL BOARD
(From the (lac college Cosmos)

The chief help, if such it were, an editorial board
has been to Cosmos editors the last few years is that
the names of its members filled 3. hit of Space at the
head of the editorial Column which otherwise would have
been filled by editorials. With due respect to the mem-
bers of these former boards this does not fulfill the
functions of the editorial board.

An editorial hoard should answer two cardinal
functions. First, its members should meet with the
editor of the paper periodically to study and shape with
him the paper’s stand on current student problems.
Secondly, each member of the board should contrlbute
editorially to the column from time to time to insure B.
greater variety of style and range a: viewpoint permis.
slble within the bounds of the editorial policy of the
publication.

In the near future an editorial board will be appoint-
ed by the editor of the Cosmos with these points in
view. The board will be composed of six members.
Each member Will be requested to contribute an editor-
ial once every six weeks so that one editorial each week
will be written by the member of the board.

That an arrangment of this kind is in accord with
a trend in present day collegiate journalism may be
recognized by examining other college newspapers. To
cite an example. The Grinuell Scarlet and Black has
an editorial board of from four to five members. The
editor is an ex—officio member. Nearly all the editorials
are written regularly by the members of the board,

Cyclone Editorial Tryouts
Called Tuesday Evening

Tryouts for the editorial board of
the 1932 Cyclone will be held in the
Alumni Recitation hall Tuesday eve-
uing at 7:15 o'clock. These Will be
open only to sophomores, juniors,
and seniors, freshmen becoming eli-
gible for Cyclone work in the second
Semester.

Previous journalistic experience is
desirable for work on the Cyclone
but not necessary, according to Ken-
neth Clayton, editor, since there will
be some positions which deal chieﬂy
with organization rather than with
writing. Freshmen named to the
board last spring are expected to at—
tend the meeting, also. .
