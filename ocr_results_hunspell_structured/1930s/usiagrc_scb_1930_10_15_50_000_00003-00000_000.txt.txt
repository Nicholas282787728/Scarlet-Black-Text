was the high scorer of the game tor

throwing a pass over the line for a

it did, Langan's good defensive work
kept it from high scores.

The student Council declined to
take the responsibility of arranging
one Chapel program each week. This
was decided Sunday afternoon, Oct. 5,
a1. a meeting of the organization.

The plan suggested by the faculty
provided that once each week the
student council should select someone
from the student body to fornish the
chapel program. The council group
agreed that the plan would place too
much 'esponsibility on the student
council.
