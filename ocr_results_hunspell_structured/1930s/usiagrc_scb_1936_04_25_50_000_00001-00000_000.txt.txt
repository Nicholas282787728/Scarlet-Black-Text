to Fight for Peace

Declares

A defense of preparedness, as a
means of maintaining collective
security, and of war, as a means of
preserving civilization was offered
by Sir Herbert Ames, former Lea-
gue of Nations treasurer, as ex-
planation for the recent British
policy of increased armaments, He
spoke on “British Policy at Gene-
Va" Thursday evening in Herrick
chapel.

Quoting from Prime Minister

berlain, whom the speaker identi-
fied as probable next prime minis—
ter, Mr. Ames brought out the
fact that leaders in Britain today
believe no collective security is
possible unless all nations are pre—
pared to revert to the ultimate rs—
course, the fact of force.

May Have to Fight for Peace,

“Great Britain has come to the
conclusion that it may be neces-
sary to fight for peace, and she is
willing to do so," he said. Figures
from a recent poll, he explained,
show that 97 4/5 per cent of the
British public is in favor of Britain
remaining in the League of Na-
tions. that as per cent are ready
to sacrifice in order to employ
sanctions, and that 66 per cent are
ready for armed force in case of
necessity.
