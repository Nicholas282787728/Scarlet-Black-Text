Grid Outlook

Bradley Out of Coe Contest
With Injury Suffered

in Tutor Game

By FRANK BEATLE

The scene changes. No longer is
the Pioneer grid team striving desper—
ately to obtain its first victory in two
seasons. Rather will it be attempting
to finish up its football season with
three straight victories to counter.
balance the six earlier defeats of the
year.

Ooe college, which has always been
a disturbing [actor on the Grinnell
schedule, is next. Tied for cham-
pionship honors in the Mid-West con.
ference and playing on their own
field, the Kohawks are bound to be
tough. But with the taste of victory
remaining from the setto with Iowa
State Teachers last week, the Pioneers
are equally bound to remain in the
win column and a great battle should
be forthcoming.

felt keenly this week. Jim Bradley.

there is a ray of hope in the return
to the lineup of Vic Fini, who. al-
though playing but a short time last
week, showed his old drive and. shami-

Fini, in two attempts. crashed
through to the 10.yard marker so
that Clark might punt without danger

Backs Perform Well

The entire Grinnell backﬁeld per»
formed brilliantly at times last Sate
urday. Bradley’s hard, shifty running
returned a kickoff for 40 yards through
the entire Teachers team in addition
to accounting for one touchdown by
smashing. Bauer’s shifty open field
running and vicious tackling featured
the second half. Clark‘s passing. kick.
ing, and high.kneed racing through
the line were responsible for a num»
ber of gains, and Kingerys field gen.

vantage of every break,

Armistice Day Celebration

Shelton L_ Beatty, dean of men.
was speaker of the day at the Arm—
istice celebration held Friday at Lynn—
ville.

He spoke on the characteristics
which make up the international, as
well as the national, citizen.

In illustrating the point that prom—
inent national figures may often spring
from very unpretentious surroundings
he cited the fame gained by the late
Jesse lVIacy, eminent Grinnel] political
scientist and historian who spent his
early years in LynnviLlc.

Mordy Delivers
Vesper Address
on »World Peace

“World peace is not impossible", do.
Clared the Rev. James T. Mordy of
Des Moines at Vespers Sunday. “it
all of us are determined to see the
matter through, The great obstacle
in the way of peace may be seen in
the attitude the people adopt on the
subject"

He divided the citizens of the world
into ﬁve classes. As the first group he
mentioned those who Say there is
nothing they can do about peace, but
“pass them by," said Mr. Mordy, “for
they can never do anything,"

Ask Proparcdncss

Then there are those who long fnr
peace but think that we should pre-
vent war by preparing armaments
These are the people who are always
crying ”preparedness", the speaker
continued.

In the third group are those who
talk about the glory of the war. “War
to them is a lyric glory, an ennobling
experience.” But he pointed out, little
do they realize the awlul horrors of
war.

“Dangerous Men"

“The most malignant. powerful and
dangerous men are those who profit
on war munitions; those who make
killing their business; for in the world
war it took $25,000 worth of rnurii.
tions to kill one human being.” These
manufacturers encourage war, the Rev.
Mr. Mordy attested.

Another class which is thwarting
the attempts of the peace makers is
that. one which is responsible for the
enormous amount of propaganda pre~
Valent in the world Dodgy—making it
impossible to know what to believe,
said the speaker. He went on to ac.
cuse the press of distorting news and
thereby poisoning the minds of the
people.

Preview of ‘Prosperity’
Planned Next Monday

“Prosperity,” written and directed
by Maurice Birdsall, will he presented
at 3:15 o'clock Monday evening in the
auditorium of the Alumni Recitation
hall; The presentation will serve
the purpose of a preview for its ioint
appearance on Nov, 23 with “Cox and
Box" at Webster City.

Mr. Birdsall‘s play is a pseudo-mor—
ality farce in one act. The setting is
decidedly impressionisuc, depicting in
a highly colorful manner both the in.
side and outside of the house of “You"
and “”Me, and also the road to the
poorhouse.

The cast of characters is as fol—
lows: “Prologue,” Helen Louise Bes.
sey; “Music Maker," Sabeth Mix;

fidence," Eugene Jongewaard; “De.
pression,” John McMurray; "Wolf,"

Pan-American Relationships
Topic of Address

"Do not confine yourselves to one
countryi one state, one nation, or even
one continent, but broaden yourselves
in the realization that a great oppor.
tunity lies in other nations of other
parts of the world." demanded Char-
les D, Hui-rey, sccretary of thc inter.
national committee of the Young
Men's Christian association [or foreign
relations, in his lecture given Mon—
day night in Herrick chapel.

The speaker, discussing “A New
Deal for PanaAmcl‘ican Relations,"
presented a challenge to the youth
of the United States to interest them-
selves in Central and South America.

Ineffective Diplomats

"The weak spot in the relations with
South America has been the appoin
ment of ‘deserving political workers'
to diplomatic posts." This the speaker
declared has resulted in a great mis-
understanding slncc the United StatesY
representatives were not qualified, and
did not try, to understand the South
Americans.

There is a great difference in the
social manners and customs between
North and South America which has
also contributed to the lack of under.
standing between the peoples of the
two continents.

Religion a Barricr

Another barrier lo [ricudly inter—
coulse between the two Continents is
the prevailing religion Tho religion
which dominates in South America is
the Roman Cathollc faith and, until
recently, the speaker asserted. their
was no religious tolei-ation. “Many
South Americans now welcome the
advent of Protestantism because it is
expected to stimulate the Roman Cath-
olic church which had grown less alld
