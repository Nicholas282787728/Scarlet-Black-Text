Richard Rossman, ’35, Has
Accident During Vacation

Richard Rossmcn. Grinnell sopho~
more, is at his home in Wilmette,
lll., recovering from a serious skat—
ing accident which occurred during
Christmas Vacation. IL was first
thought that Mr. Rossrnan had con—
cussion of the 171' . but when an
x-ray was taken no concussion was
evident. His condition is improving
and he will probably be able to re-
sume his studies before long.

“A three day period for reading
and study preceding comprehensive
examinations this semester is one of
the most interesting experiments
Grinncll college has ever undertaken
during my 26 years as a member of
this faculty." stated Henry s. Conar
professor of botany. in his talk in
Chapel Thursday morning explaining
the three-day reading period to begin
Monday, January 16.

At the decision of the faculty
there will be no classes Jan. 16, 17
and 18 except for freshmen at the op-
tion of their professors. There will be
no social activities scheduled and no
committee meetings planned it is
hoped. students are requested to re-
main at school and conferences with
instructors may be arranged at any
time during the period.

“It may prove to be a failure." he
continued, “or it may be a huge suc<
cess~all depending upon the attitude
taken by students. Since the college
is designed primarily that young peo-
ple may receive an education through
cooperative effort. it is hoped that

at this time Grinnell students will

Richard Sneed
Tells of Talk
With Coolidge

The only interview on religion
granted by Calvin Coolidge after he
left the White House was obtained
by a former Grinnell college student,
according to a statement made in
Boston yesterday by J. Richard Snood
'32, now a student at Boston universi-
ty Theological school.

Mr, Snead was guest of the former
president. Aug. 22, 1932, and quoted
Mr. Coolidge as saying “Church meni-
borsnip is a matter of one's own
judgment. Some of course are profes-
sional joincrs but 1 should think peo-
ple would want to ally themselves
with activities designed to better hu—
man relationships.n

Asked whether the minister should
seek to inﬂuence legislation. Mr. Cool-
idge said. “1 don't know. I remember
a sentence by a Roman poet to the
effect that Jesus never spent any
time in the lobby of the Caesars. He
had another way to get things done.”

Nearly 5 o’clock Fresh—
Betler Take Your Bath!

All freshmen will now be required
to take their Friday and Saturday
night showers before 5 o'clock on
these evenings.

This resolution was passed by the
Council of House Presidents in their
meeting Thursday evening. The rea-
son for this action is, that by this
plan a better distribution of the hot
water' will be obtained and it will not
be all used up at once. '

unite in an effort to broaden them-
selves and to get something out of
their education."

Mr. Conard told of how the com»
prehensive exams and the method of
self-directed and individual study
which will be tried during the readr
lag period. are employed to a gmater
or less extent by such schools as
Oxford, Swarthmore, Dartmouth and
the University of Chicago.
Swarthmcre students spend their
last two years in individual study
while at oxford university in Eng-
land thc whole course is planned for
independent study." remarked Mr.
Canard,

Mr. Conard also made several sug-
gestions as to how to make use of
the three days. He recommended reg-
ular meals, eight hours of sleep, two
hours of exercise. and ten hours of
study. The student is advised not to
"cram" for the examinations but to
do outside reading in order to broad-
en his outlook on the field. The time
may be used entirely on the major
course or may be divided among sev-
eral according to the individual stu-
dent.

‘Shakespeare,
Rebel’,—Kuhl

Research Professor Speaks
in A. R. H. Auditorium

"Soul of his age.” was the high
tribute paid William Shakespeare by
Ben Johnson. a contemporary writer.
according to Prof. E_ B. Kllhl. re-
scarch professor from the University
of lowa. who lectured on “Shaker
spcare, the New Interpretation." in
Lne Alumni Recitation hall auditor—
ium last night

“Analogous to the interim between
1913 and 1933 was the age in which
Shakespeare lived and Wrote," said
Professor Kuhl, The speaker pointed
out economic chaos. political dissen-
sion, and an era of Satiristlc. his»
toric. and tragic writing that existed
around 1600 as it does today. Shake—
speare led a revolution against the
Elizabethian age with his political
satircs in drama that are not equalled
by modern writers of political satire,
Kllhl believes.

“Julius ceasar, King Leer, and
nearly all other plays that Shake—
speore wrote, delved into history to
more emphatically warn the writer's
contemporaries of rising political dis
scnsion in England then I believe."
said the speakcr. Many of Shake-
speare's plays wcre taken from that
period in history in which the houses
of Lancaster and York were divided
and at war, is Kuhl’s belief. The
source of the sixteenth century play»
Wright’s works is a disputed issue
among shnkospesrlan scholars.

England was siczcd with a spirit of
nationalism, intense fear of outside
aggression, and a deep seated con~
vicilon that she had a destiny when
Shokcspcsrc arrived in London. He
then concerned himself with writing
plays with a moral which invariably
warned thc people of the dangers of
their iempcr-omcnt.
