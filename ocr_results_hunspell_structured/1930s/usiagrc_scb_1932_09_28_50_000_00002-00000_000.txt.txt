There is no doubt that the league is furthering
a worthy rouse. It is not an idle hope that interest
of members will ltccp us high as it is now, and that
the league won’t prove, like some previous organi-
letiolls,10 bc a “ﬂash in the pan,”

THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE

Lost your the Chicago Tribune was removed
from the library filcs, because. according to the
library committce. of lack of funds to continue
thc subscription. Con funds be found this year to
return that paper to the library?

’l‘hcl-c. are ill school a number of students from
Chicago and the. Surrounding towns. Although this,
in itself. is not the main reason for putting the
Tribune ill the files, it should surely be taken into
consideration by the library committee.

in the. New York Times and the Baltimore Sun
we have cxmuples of large eastern city journalism.
Why not on cxomple from the luidwcst’s largest
city‘? ls it because of thc Tribune’s editorial policy
concerning prohibition and militarism? Let us hope
college students are old enough to judge the worth
of questions for themselves and not children who
may be allowed to see only one side of the situation
Anyhow is the odifol'ial policy of a paper the most
important item?

‘SHIBOLETH’

In his zlddres \Iolldoy. at the first collroc tioll
of the year, Pres lent Nollcn pointed out the drill-
gcr of allowing oneself to be swayed by family
prejudice. or campaign cntchwords, iu dccidiug

lion, and compared it to ancient days when the
mispronlmciatioll of the word “Shibolelh” resulted
in a great tribal sloughtcl.

\Vc. heartily agree with the president. Citi’cns,
especially College students who will someday be
leaders in their own colulnulli res at lczlsl. should
certainly lnlrc all active and intelligent intcrcst ill
the political affairs of the country and should study
cnrefully the policics and issues or the various
national parties before casting their roles.

To Sci the right party is going to he a task

cllcc in lhcir planks. One party came out squarely
for repeal of lhc’cightcclltll omcndmcnt. while all»
other stayed on the fence, trying to pleuso both the
wcts and the (ll'. —2\ ticklish business. Later, the
candidate for pre idellt on that some party’s ticket,
admitted the failure of the present Volstcnd act,
while the candidate for vice president is still fill
out and ollt dry.

\Vc may be wrong. but it is our belief that thc
highcst officer ill our country should not be selected
because of the party which is backing lliln, or be-
cause of campaign promises, but because of his own
record,vnot necessarily as an engineer. or a fish-
erman—vbut as on executive,

QUICK, HENRY—
(Daily l'llilli)

Have you ever asked the question. “What kind of
a. summer did you have, Gus?” and then settled your-
self to a half hour of relaxation while listening to a
boring series of anecdotes on what happened the night
in Walla VVzlla or how sereamingly funny it. was when
John fell off the hundred feet cliff and nearly broke
the bull's neck when he landed?

There ought to be a. law. Yes. there might even be
two laws. on the subject. We should exterminate‘this
recounter cf vacation tales with the same avidity that
we work on house flies and yearbook salesmen. Instead
of the old line about "Quick, Henry, . . i We should
have another motto concerning the immediate and
speedy choking of the pest who persists in telling about
his summer when everyone knows that he stayed right
at home in Bohdville and didn't see anything more
thrilling than the daily traction tearing through at
thirteen miles per lluur.

Sitting around a fraternity house we hear wild
tales of how the wolf was killed just as he was about
to murder in cold blood the pet dog of the fumily, and
then we sink in clouds of utter boredom when they
found out that it was merely a police dog that came
to pay a visit to the newcomer in his prowling territory.
Nothing is more dismal than the damp and scummy
feeling that permeates the amosphere when the annual
ghost story contest is on following the summer excur-
sions into the north woods or to worse places. Everyone
had a night of horrors when they thought surely hat
a bear had them by the back of the neck to find that it
was merely no innocent squirrel putting away the grub-
Stake for the winter to avoid the breadline and Hoover
prosperity.

Perhaps we haven't made ourselves clear, but we
can find nothing more boring on this campus than the
stories put out by these one-satchel travelers who take
a three dollar excursion to the state line for the first
time, and then just can’t help talking about the event
for the next three years any mom than Mrs. McGuffy
can help bringing up her operation at the bridge club

every Monday afternoon at four. Down with the tribe.
we hate 'em.
