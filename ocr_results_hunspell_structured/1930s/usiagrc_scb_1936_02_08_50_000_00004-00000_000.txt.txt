The place of Christianity in a
modern world has been the gener-
elal topic of the last few Cotes
memorial lectures, rather than its
distinctly religions aspects, an in
vestigation into the Scarlet
Black file: shows. The tradition
will be continued next week by Dr,
George Buttl'ick, this year's
speaker, who will have as his gen
eral topic, “Christ and the Chung
ing Worlr "

Many famous mcn have lectured
under the Gates memorial fund,
which was established in 1913 by
a group of alumni in memory of

_ Mr. George A. Gates, president of
Grinnell trom 1887 to 1900.
Among the speakers have been Dr
Harry Emerson Fusdick, then or
the Union Theological seminary in
New York City, in 1925; Harry F.
Ward of the same school, who lec-
tured on “The Demands of Con-
temporary Civilization Upon Re-
ligion" in 1931: and Henry Churn
chill King, president at Oberlin
college, speaking on “Christ and
the New World” in 1921,

Wilhelm Pauck, professor of
church history at the Chicago
Theological seminary, spoke in
1933 on “The Christian in the Mode
ern Crisis.” Dr. Ernest‘F. Tittle,
pastor of the First Methodist
Episcopal church of Evanston,

and,

,Ill., chose as his topic in 1934.
“Tellsxons in Religion." Last year
Dr. John Haynes Ho‘lmcs, pastor
oi the Community church of New
York city, spoke on “Protestant
m. Capitalism, and the Future".
hc Gates lectures have always
been held in conjunction with thel
annual Fellowship Coiiierciice of
Iowa Congregational churchesl
Tllell‘ stated purpose is "to carry
on President Gates plan of hiring-
llng to Grinncll the best of mod-
ern lhought." They were at first
in cooperation with the snnual‘
Day of Prayer, but later sup-
planted it The Day of Prayer had
been dcvoted entirely to sermons
and class meetings, and was a has
tional institution.
