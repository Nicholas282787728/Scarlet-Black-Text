in the new ﬂvmlnon PACK

W5 have been in the tobacco business it long
time down here at Winston-Salem and we take
a lot of pride in the quality of the cigarcttcs we
make.

While we have spent a good many million
dollars advertising Camels, we’re always hold
to the old fashioned idea that tho thing that
really counts is what we put into our cigarette
and not what we say about ii.

If we know anything about tobacco, and we
think we do, Camels contain the choice Turk-
ish and the rucllowest, ripest dorncstl lcuves
that money can buy.

In fact we have every reason to be proud of
the quality of Camels as they collie from the
factory, but the remark of an old friend of ours
from Dcnvcr some time ago em phosizcd u point
that has been thc problem of the cigarette
industry for years.

As he inhaled the smoke from n Cumcl we
gave him in our ofﬁces one morning, he sighed
with vcry evident enjoyment and thou asked
jokingly, “What is this, a special hlcnd rc.
scrvcd for Cnlnel executives?"

“Certainly not,” we told him. “This package
of Camels was bought at the corner store this
luorning.”

“Well,” he said, “i’m been a dyed in the wool
Cu 1 smoker for a good many years, hut upon
my soul I novcr ‘got :1 ciglm-ttc us- good as this in
Denver. If you would give the rest of the world
the kind of Cnmcls you sell here in Winston-
Salcm, you ought to have all the cigurcttc busi-
ness there is.”

EMT statement simply em-
phasized again the cigarette
industry’s most important
problem. The more we
thought about it, the surcr
we wcrc that he was dead
right, and that somehow,
something must be donc.

You may be sure we gave this report a lot of

and then we went ahead. We tried this device
and that. At last we met success. The air-tight
