Graflund at Guard Post

in Practice Sessions
Thursday, Flriday

Clarence (Snap) James, reserve
halfback with the Gl'inllell eleven
last year, and one of the outstand-
ing backfield candidates, was the
first casualty of the 1931 season
when he reeci ed a slight coneusr
sion in the first scrimmage of the
season Friday.

The wiry Cedar Rapids gride
man rested well last night: and
seemed better today. He will be
out of practice for several days,
lion-ever.

Mercury Soors

Under a blazing sun which sent
the mercury soaring over the an den
gres mark, more than 30 Grionell
gridiron candidates started practice
for the 1931 season Thursday morn-
ing.

Coach L. L. (Fuzz) Watt and
Coach Les Duke did not spend the
time usually devoted to early season
calisthenics, but plungcd into foot»
hall fundamentals at once. This move
was necessitated by the short time
remaining for practice before the op-
ening game with Cue college here
Sept. 25.

New Men Good

The Pioneer mentor followed ple—
dictlons when he worked both Rose
and Grdflund in the line, later taking
Rose back with the ball carriers but
leaving Graflund at a. guard position.

The work with new material in the
line automatically slows practice
sessions, but Conch Watt will have
ample material to fill the vacant
guard and tackle positions Trumbull,
Canavan, and Lake are among the
sophomores working at the tackles.

Bilto at Tackle

Coach Watt gave Bilto, his only
veteran end, a chance at tackle yes-
terday. Bilto weighs in the neighbor-
hood of 180 pounds and his exper-
ience as 2. back in high school and
as a. hand here has given him ample
football knowledge.

If Bilto is shifted to tackle it will
mean two new wlngmen for the 1931
team. Golz and Edman, a pair of re»
serves from the 1930 squad seem to

Students May
Retain Licenses
of Home States

Students from states other than
Iowa who operate cars will be per-
mitted the use of their home state
licenses during th academic year as
a result of a decision by the motor
vehicle department of the State,
reached in a conference last March.

Grinnell college has received a sup-
ply of applications of student permits
from William A. Stevens, superin-
tendent of the department. By fill~
ing but one of these applications the
students may secure stickers to be
placed on the Windshields of their
cars, signifying permission has been
granted.

Alex Manson, Grinnsll chief of
police, will permit college men here
to use out of state plates until Dee.
1 under the Buddy permission law,
but at that time those who do not
have the special permission to use
plates from other states much pur-
chase Iowa licenses.

men who composed an unofficial or-
gznizatiun known as the Owl's club.
The club had no director and did not
give concerts, but confined its activ-
ities to impromptu programs on the
campus.

Rouge, Powder Often Undesirable
For Coed Appearing Before Camera

Now that Grinncll coeds have subr
scribed for The Scarlet and Black
and will receive free 8 by 10 hand
colored portraits at the Portrait Art
studios. they must be warned against
the possibilities of ruining that bar-
gain offer through their own carlsss-
mess. The failure of a portrait to live
up to expectations is not always the
fault of thc photographer.

It will probably be wise not to
have the picture taken until a wsck
or two after the opcning classwork.
If the subject is nervous, tired, and
indisposed, the camera will reﬂect a
worn face. Drooping shoulders and a
downcast expression should never be
presented before the camera.

It is not necessary, according to
an article by Elsie Pierce in the D25
Moincs Register last summer, to
make a trip to the hair dre'sssl' before
the portrait appointment. Hair too
