ed out to he the Dibble-Smith
fray. Dibble won from Smith last
Saturday, 85, but Smith protest.
ed that the winning goal was
scored after the whistle had been
blown to signin a dead ball.

At a meeting of the intramural
board Wednesday night, the Smith
protest was upheld, In the play—
off, Robert Neiman's smooth foot-
work aided the victors immeasur-
ably. The tilt was a seesaw af-
fair, first one team scoring and
then the other countering until
the fourth period when Smith
forged ahead.

Langan player injured

The Dibble-Langan game was a
rough and tumble affair in which
Wilbur Maris, Laganite, suffered
a severe leg injury. Hal Dean
was the most impressive Dibble
player with the rest of the team
playing like a welletrained aggre-
gation. James Cutfortli scored
the Langan points on a pass in
the last gunrter.

Smith outplayed Gates to win
their game. The playing was
ragged on both sides, but Gates
lost a lead they spent three
periods building. Neiman and
Turner looked best for the win.
ners while the losers featured
Carns and Smith.

The standings were changed hy
Smith’s surprise victory putting
them in first place over Dibble,
Langan taking thir Clark re-
maining in fourth, Rawson taking
over fifth, due to Cate's defeat
which set them down in last
place Monday, Clark meets Raw-
son to defend their position.

igan State college claims that
“Life is one danifool thing after
another and love is two damfool
things after each other."

em Hemisphere rather than leav-
ing it to the United States alone,
she said.

Miss Schain pointed out that
up until the time of President
Hoover, the Monroe Doctrine was
being interpreted as giving the
United States a particular right

to interfere and to collect debts
in Latin and South America,

It was Hoover who started the
new regime, she continued, and
made it plain that the United
States would no longer interfere
but rather would cooperate.

"The present administration is
continuing this policy," Miss
Schain said. “and President Roos—
evelt is doing good work,"

Miss Schain, who is chairman
of the committee on the Cause
and Cure of War, attended the
South American conference and
reviewed its agreements for the
meeting Saturday.
