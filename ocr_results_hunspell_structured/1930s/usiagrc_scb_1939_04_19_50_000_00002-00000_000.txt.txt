STUDENTS AGAINST WAR

Tomorrow, April 20, is Hitler‘s birthday.
Tomorrow is student peace dayi Students on
campuses throughout the United States are
gathering to express their concern for world
security and their sympathy for a positive
peace program At 11:00 a.m., on all these
campuses, demonstrations will begin; on
this campus a.convocation will be held. We
are fortunate in having the Reverend
Charles Snyder of Davenport as our speak-
er.
The United Student Peace Committee is-
sued a call for student expression of desire
for peace in 1934. April, month of the an-
niversary of our entrance into the World
war, was chosen Every year, since that
first Peace Day, alert students, interested in
a realistic activity for peace, have sponsored
open forums, debates and mass meetings to
arouse the college community with a view
to furthering progressive measures in spe—
cific fields What have we done in this
movement?

This year plans have been made to awaken
Grinnellians to take an active interest in
affairs which now so ‘ominously’ affect us.
What do you think of Roosevelt‘s conduct
in the international field . . . of his domes
tic policy‘l Are you an isolationist? Are you
a collective securityist? What in America
must be done to keep democracy working?
What can Grinnellians do to express our
views on these questions?

At the convocation Thursday morning a
box will be placed in the chapel entry; you
are urged to deposit, therein, personal sug»
gestions for such action. Come to the meet-
ing. You attendance will show that you
‘don’t want war.’ Grinnell must not isolate
itself from this united demonstration. Smash
the reputation Grinnellians earn for indif-
ference and apathy toward affairs import-
ant to all peoples Let us not stand apart,
but become a pa ' of a united peace move-
ment.

YOU'RE TELLING US?

(Reprinted from the Gas College Cosmos)
Gl‘innell's Coming affiliation with the Mid-
west conference, welcome as it may be from
the standpoint of competition and prestige,
certainly doesn’t figure to improve the gen-
eral quality of basketball facilities over the
circuit.

Less pretentious gymnasia than Grinncll’s
can be found only at Beloit and Cornell.
The court at Beloit, like the one at Grin-
nell, is a ”cracker box” (or “telephone
booth”). Cornell’s arena, to swipe a Dick
Pollack expression, is a ”bowling alley."

For that matter, the courts at Knox,
Carleton and Ripon are nothing to write

peans about The basketball situation at
Galesburg is so bad, frankly, that they stage
the games in a ramshackle armory building,
which is generally about knceedcep in do
bris.

If a positive relationship existed between
good facilities and good teams, there would»
n’t be any doubt as to who would win the}
Midwest conference basketball champion-i,

WASHINGTON'S ADVICE

Elsewhere in this issue of the Scarlet and
Black another writer reminds us of the fa
mous advice uttered by George Washington
in his “Farewell Address" The advice,
which in brief form was to avoid entangling
foreign commitments, must have been heard
with satisfaction by a people who had only
a few years before won their freedom from
a foreign government It was wise advice
for a young nation whose development lay
before it; but wise though it was, it was,
not followed. In the generation after Wasli-‘
ington spoke the words that have since been
the golden text of every isolationist, the
United States had been involved in two
foreign wars—one with France and one
with England. ,

We were a little countly then in every
sense. In the states huddled along the At-
lantic coast no one was paying income tax
on a half million dollars a yea x Battleships
did not cost seventy-three million dollars to
build There were no gangsters; there was
not even a Chicago There was no radio.
There was no big business There was no
Fourteenth Amendment Even the indus-
trial revolution was still to come. To be
sure, there were dictators; one of them was
to become the first Emperor of the French
There were also wars, and the United States
also fought in then , but no soldier in them,
lost his life by breathing mustard gas or by
being struck by a bomb dropped from an
airplane. Europe was not two thousand
miles away It was Six weeks away. We
must never forget that distance is of no
signi ’cancc except ill terms of timer There
is no place now on earth as far from Grin~
nell, Iowa, as New York then was from
London.

We are a different country now We are
very big and very rich; Europe is very
near; it is so near that we can in literal truth
hear it. It is easier to hear Europe than to
hear the man in the next town, for it is
easier to dial a short wave station than to
make a long distance call. Isolation is im-
possible u'ithout the consequences of isola—
tion, and they are the loss of money, the
loss of size, the loss of prestige, and the loss
of pride. Perhaps these are small things;
but try to convince the average isolationist
that wealth and power are unimportant
Only when yoll have made him realize that
we must pay for what we get and that noth»
illg is more expensive than privacy, only
then will he understand what isolation
means in a. world whose circumference is
not twenty-six thousand miles but not less
than ten minutes and not more than two
weeks.

“More marriages are wrecked by college-
trained girls not working and having too
much time on their hands, than by their
working." Dr. James McConaugliy, pre
dent of Wesleyan university, thinks that it
is unfair to force a young wife who could
earn some money for herself, to beg her
husband for spending money.

“Democracy grew up here and it is best
for you but in Germany, we never did have
any real democracy . . . That is wily we gave
it up." Max F. Heinze, 17-year-old German
exchange student at Moses Brown school,
thinlis it would be impossible for the U, S.

[3 F.D.R. Sticking
Thumb Too Far

In Foreign Pic.J
—B‘y W.C.H.-——

From the large, black headlines
of the weekend, it is easy to de-
duce that our boy Franklin has
again been playing little Jack
Horner, sticking his thumb into
the international pie.

Presenting himself in his favor-
ite role of arbiter of internation-
al morale, Franklin D. whipped
a lengthy document over to Hi
ler and Mussolini in which he in~
nocently asked them to promise
not to attack any of the nations
of Europe and the near East for
the next ten years. Also lnclud»
ed in this message was the naive
idea that, if this promise of non-
aggrcssion were given England
and France could then be per—
suaded (by Roosevelt. of course)
to sit down with Italy and Ger-
many, make a decent deal, and
scrap their battleships.

Just what the squire of Hyde
Park had in mind when he dashed
off this hit of correspondence is
hard to determine. 0n the sure
face, it is plainly an outgrowth
of the administration's decided
swing into the stopetheedictators
camp, but the important item is
the reason for this swing express-
ing itself in this particular way.
Since the President surely could
have had no real hope of ringing
the hell with so ingenuous a pro-
posal. he must have had another
reason up his sleeve.

It is not altogether Impossible
that the real purpose of his mes
sage was but to furnish himselr
with another excuse to pan the
dictators upon their foregone neg
ative answer. In other words, if
and when Hitler and Mussolini
tell Franklin D. nothing doing7
as all reliable sources now expect
them to doiﬁooseveu can turn
with wide-eyed innocence to the
American people and say, “My
friendsl We have done our best
to offer Italy and Germany a
peaceful means of settling their
differences with the rest of the
world, but they wouldn't cooper—
ate Hence, only one course ree
mains open to us: we must join
our sister democracies in a last
stand against Fascism." And of
course, if our “sister democra—
cies” should start mixing it up
with the Fascists, our “last
stand” could be conveniently
stretched to include 15 billion
dollars and an army and navy.

Unfortunately, if this possibili-
ty should mature, Johnnie Q.
Public would probably be suffi-
ciently simple to swallow such
stuff, completely forgetting the
primary impracticability of the
proposal and the scant chance the
dictators would have of a square
deal at the hands of Britain and
France if they did accept.

Because of just such a possible
outgrowth of Roosevelt's action.
men like Borah of Idaho, Johnson
of California, and McCerran of
Nevada wish that Franklin D.
would mind his own business.
Verbal meddling in European af»
fairs, although seemingly inno-
cent at the time, can too easily
lead to meddling of a dirrei-ent
sortimeddling in which the blood
of the nation's young men is at
stake.

Whatever recognition as an up
holder of the world's morals Roos-
evelt may gain by his amateur
diplomacy is not worth the cost
in blood and treasure which his
meddling may all too easily pro-
duce. It might be agood idea
for Franklin Roosevelt to read

 

to have a dictator. The people would laugh
him out of power.

Washington’s Farewell Address
and abide by its advice.
