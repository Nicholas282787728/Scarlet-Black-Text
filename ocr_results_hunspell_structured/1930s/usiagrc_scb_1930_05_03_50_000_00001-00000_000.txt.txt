LocalTrack Athletes Tryito Repeat
Performance of Last Season
at Northfieltl Today.

Fifteen members of the Grinnell
college track squad left last night
for Northﬁeld, Minn., wherel they
will open their schedule of outdoor
dual meets with Carleton. The Pio-
neers triumphed over the Carls here
last season by a 791/, to 51% mar-
gin.

The local team swept through its
series of duals in 1929 without a loss
and is out to repeat again this sea-
son. After tackling the Carleton
aggregation this week-end the Drake
varsity and freshman outﬁts will be
seen in action on the local cinder
path next Friday, and the Grinnellr
ians will joumey to St. Louis for a
dual with Washington university on
May 17.

Gl'niiell Makes Milo Bid.

Today's meet ﬁnds a. pair of teams
both reasonably strong in distance
men, but lacking in stellar field men,
clashing, Coach Duke has practic-
ally conceded a good share of halfr
mile points to the Carleton outﬁt,
which had a crack two milerrelay
team at the Drake relays. He plans
to use only Murphy in this cvcnt. He
will make a. strong bid in the milc
with McIlrath and McKenzic run-
ning, however, and in the two-mile
with Secor and Pye striking out for
points.

The Grinnell ﬁeld men came
through in great shape last season,
as the Carls fell down miserably in
those events, and were really re
sponsible for the Grinnell victory.
The Grinnellians will battle on even
terms in the distance this season,
however, but will probably have to
concede short dash places. The quar-
tervmile and mile-relay look like
Pioneer victories.

the Drake relays to take the top
