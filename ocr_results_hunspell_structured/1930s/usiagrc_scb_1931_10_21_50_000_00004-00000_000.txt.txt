DO you think that the men should
or should not lye allowed, to play
cards in their clubrooins during the
quiet hours?

\Vﬂlter St‘rltley: I believe thaL
there should be no rule in regard to
it. Since quiet hours could not pos-
sibly be affected by a noiseless game
of bridge, why not make this optional
as long as such a policy would not
infringe upon study hours?

Joe Pojma Yes, I believe they
Should because it will be better than
having to keep it in the dark.

Edson Attleson: If men have the
power of will to cease playing and
start studying when they should, yes.
It is a form of diversion which al-
‘lows a much desired fellowship.

Theodore McGee: Upperclassmen
should be allowed to play cards in
the clubrooms at their own discres
tion, although same restrictions
Should be placed upon the freshmen.

Robert Church: Of course card
playing should be allowed. The club-
room is a place of recreation anc
rest to be used by the Students at
their own discretion, II. is better to
play in the clubroom than to play
in other rooms where games of poor-
cr reputation might be played.

Joiui Wiley Yes, cards should be
played in the clubrooms. Cards sel-

‘dam become exciting as to result in
any boistemusness.

Leroy IFiglnrid: No, because when
students are granted the privilege
they abuse it. Three hours is not too
long to be quiet.

Matt Shrinkland; AS long as they
don‘t play Spat.

to Discontinue
‘Frosh Days’

Clark l'llas Upperclassmen
Acting as Advisers

for Freshmen

Smith liall voted Sunday night to
abolish "prep days" in the building
hereafter. The action climaxed two
meetings Saturday ‘and Sunday which
came out of the fall freshman days
which were held by all the buildings
of the dormitories Friday and Satur-
day.

It was also decided at Sunday
night’s meeting to formulate plans
for a committee to take care of
freshman training throughout the
entire year. The committee is to
deal with each individual freshman,
and will have power to prohibit the
freshman who is failing in his work
through over participation in extra~
curricular activities or social activ-
ities from entering more than a cer—
tain number of added fields and lim-
it the nights during the week he will
he able to have dates.

Clark hall, while abolishing fresh-
man days, has assigned one upper-
classman to be the advisor for each
freshman, and to see that he has
completed his day's study. No fresh-
man will be allowed to leave his
room during the study hours without
his advisor's permission. and then
only to go to the library, or after
completing his work,

Men may have dates during the
week if they show that their work is
up. Otherwise freshmen will be per-
mitted dates only on Fridays and
Saturdays. Any freshman who
breaks the rules will be forced to
stay in the hall even on weekend
nights fen one week or more depend~
ing on the seriousness of the ul-
fense. This will be decided by the
upperclassmen.

These are the only two halls who
have taken any action on the situ-
ation. Clark's method was proposed
in the editorial columns of The Scar-
let and Black last year.

stands at the very top in the com-
mercial world of Grinnell. They
are one of the land marks of the
section and the reputation they
have made in the time they have
served the public is indeed an ens
viable one. They have built their
business on the idea that honesty
pays. Stores that carry standard
lines of merchandise are the ones
that make a city a trading centcr.
At McMurray'S only the best nar
tionally-advertised brands are to
be bad, They feature the well-
known Munsingwear, Waynekmt
hosiery and pajamas, strutwear
hosiery, They carry a complete
and up-tosdete line of wash and

that are style right. Here One
finds too a complete stock _of

MANATT .t COiVB’ANY
it is from the romantic days of
1860 that the new fall and winter
season draws its inspiration. This
year's styles are delightfully dif-
ferent from those of last year.
There's a new angle on hats. They
tilt forward over the right eye in
a gay, provocative way. Dresses
have higher waistlines and sleeves
are important again. Their skirts
are straightened with pleats and
hidden flares, intricately fashione
ed to give low fullness. Coats have
that new wide-shouldered look and
are molded to a slim waist-line.
Accessories have gained a new rm-
portance. They must be carefully
selected to correspond with your
costume. At Manatts one finds
the most complete selection of
clothes to be found in this section
and here one may select one's
wardrobe with the knowledge that
everything about it will be entire-
ly correct. Frocks, hats, coats for
every age, for every type are to
be found at this shop. The owner
of this store keeps in close touch
with the markets and so one finds
here a wide selection, each item
absolutely fashionrright. Manatt’s
have always been interested in
Grinnell College and its students,
and have had a welcome at all
times for any of those connected
with the college. What is the
range in price of ladies' costs?

The cafe of Grinnell that draws
those who really like good food is

the country. The pure silk full~
fashioned hosiery 7 chiffon and

ed here? Who is the manager?

of business?

GRINNELL DAIRY COMI’ANY

Wholesome milk, the kind that
carries the vitamines intact and
makes digestion easy is that
which comes from the Cn'nnell
Dair Company. Physicians and
dieti ans alike recommend it. But
aside from the fact that this dairy
is a health giver the fact that it
is also an aid to the entire com-
munity must not be overlooked. In
any section where there are dair-
ies we‘can lock for prosperity be-
cause it is from these institutions
that the basic wealth of n ccun~
try or section is developed. The
Grmhell Dairy Company produces
milk that carries the right amount
of butterfat; it is from accredited
herds which are fed properly and
kept in pefect condition. They
specialize in milk which is espec-
ially adapted to babies. They take
the greatest care in keeping not
only their herd in good condition
but in keeping the utensils that
are used in their place and all
other things around thei dairy in
perfectly sanitary condition. Who
is the manager? When was this
dairy opened? What average
amount will they spend annualry
m the county for produce?

BADER AND BELL (Florists)

Since its inception the business
of the Bader and Bell Florists
company has been steadily in-
creasing, until now they are one
of the really big business con—
cerns in the county. Cut flowers
are a specialty here, and the var—
iety of fresh flowers to choose
from is a large one. The flowers
are always new and fresh. The
manager of this company knows
his business thoroughly. This com-
pany has a large investment here
and the customer is counted as a
personal friend. Here is a place
where only experts in this line of
business are employeed. This firm
is one of the most prosperous con-
cerns in 'Lllis county and they are
glad to be able to assist in any
move for the development of the
county or any of its institutions.
They have always been friendly
with the Grinnell student body and
the students have recipiocated by
giving them their business. Flow-
ers for any and every occasion
are available here and if you will
leave the selection to the Bader
and Bell company simply telling
them the price you wish to pay
and the occasion they are to be
used for, you will be certain that
your offering will be in excellent
taste. They have weekend specials
at very reasonable prices. Who is
the manager of this company?
What is their investment here?
iWhat flowers do they specialize

MET CAFE

The Metropolitan Cafe in Grin-
nell is the one that offers to the
public a meal that really appeals.
The first thing that the stranger
notices here is the service. They
seem really glad that you have
come in and a smile always
greets you when you enter the
door. The entire place is always in
spotless order; the food is prop-
erly prepared, and when it reaches
you it looks appetizing and it
tastes even better than it looks.
The Metropolitan Cafe, under the
new management, extends a cord-
ial welcome to Grinnell students,
The owner of this cafe under-
stands his business. He knows how
to treat the public. His personal
popularity is the cause of this
business being is leader here. At
this place one may secure a really
good meal at a most reasonable
price. They are open from 5:30
can. to 1 at night. Who is the
owner? How many will this cafe
seat? What is the price of noon
lunch?

COLONIAL THEATRE

The theatres of the nation are
today not only places of amuse—
ment but are of educational ad-
vantage to the general public as
well. We have an example of this
in the Colonial Theatre at Grin-
nell. Here the very best pictures
that the cinema world can boast
are used, with the greatest of the
screen actors. Here also are trav-
clogues and news reels run which
mean that those who patronize
this theatre not only see the lead-
ing pictures but can keep track of
the outside world as well. The
manager here does his part in
making life pleasant for the Stu~
dents of Grinnell and this reflects
itself in the way that they patron—
ize his place. His pictures are
good, are clean and you do not see
anything that carries the sugges—
tion of smut with it. If all thea-
ters were like the Colonial then
usefulness would be doubled. What
pictures will be shown next Satur-
day and Sunday? Who is the most
popular screen actress? Who is
considered the coming actor?
