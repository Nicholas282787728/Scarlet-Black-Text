Steadies Deem
Cyclone Hunt
Huge Success

The night was warm and sultry
Coeds and dormitorians, tired
from two false Cyclone alarms on
two successive nights, were pre-
paring for bed. Suddenly the far
miliar “Bong, Bong" of the col-
lege hell permeates the campus
air.

This time the ringing continr
ues. Collegiateers begin to think
that perhaps it is the real Mc-
Coy. Someone suggests calling
college central. and central is
delugcd.

The dorms empty and hundreds
of males pour out of open doors
and stampede to the quadrangle
The quad just stampedes. Steadies
look for steadies, near steadies
look for near steadics, and the
alleged hunt is on.

After the pairings
all those remaining begin the not
too extensive search for the mlSSA
ing Cyclone.

A half hour passes. Still no
Cyclone. A few Smith hall preps
of the non—dating variety happen
to walk past the flag pole. one
of them, Lewis (alias Doc) Ries
sees something up on the top. An
investigation is made. The “some-
thing" turns out to be the miss-
ing annual, The search is over,
and Doc becomes one of the more
(unpopular men with various cou—
ples around the campus.

Both Quad and Dorms reluc-
tantly fill up; the Cyclones are
distributed; and one of the better
campus traditions is put to bed.

By Anne White.
The W. A. AIS had it—bugs,
barbed wire, dust, weeds, and, in-
cidentally, a steak fryiat dusk
Wednesday in Jones Grove, which
is essentially a COerasture with
a pretty name. The party hon-
ored the 21 gals who had finally
“done or died” at least three
times for their respective cote
tages and at last were eligible
to join the exclusive organization
to which their hostesses belonged.
After receiving numerous spline
tors in delicate regions. and tear
ing their clothes and skin on the
barbed wire fence. the honored
initiates were very politely come
mandcd to don mammoth hair

‘bows of (censored) paper and to

tote tennis rackets for the eve-
ning. To keep peace, Jean Hein-
scn divided them up into three
groups of scven and slipped them
the rumor that they were to take
part in a floor show immediate
ly after the feed. (Said feed
consisted mainly of bugs and
dirt With delicious hors d’oeuvres
of steak and pic. i In the show
“Slatphdppy” Banta and chorus

After the curtain came down
on the entertainment, the digni

solemn pledge of allegiance in
which the initiated vowed to live

With such a mushily sentimen-

Clasper announced that Mears

treaty was to receive a banquet
