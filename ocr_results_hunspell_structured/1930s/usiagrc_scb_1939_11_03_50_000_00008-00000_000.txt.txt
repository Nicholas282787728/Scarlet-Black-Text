A PECULIAR TREASURE

1312/ Edna Il‘crbcr

The present flood of biographical
and autobiographical writing has
an almost ominous significance
for people who like to interpret
current trends ominously, it
would seem that the imaginary
world of fiction is vanishing be!
cause it cannot stand the camper
tition of the daily headlines. The
fantastic world we live in makes
the old proverb, “truth is stranger
than fiction," seem axiomatic.

So bewildered writers have
crawled back into the past, crawl—
ed hack into an era when they
were children, when things were
safe and secure, when Victoria,
and not Hitler set the moral make-
up of Europe, when rules of cm-
ouet were discussed with the in-
tensity given to the rules of war
today. Psychologists explain the
psychosis of the autobiographical
writer as an “attempt to crawl
back into the shelter and security
of the womb, where life held no
problems."

Miss Edna Ferber With her r
cent book, “A Peculiar Treasure '
joins the ranks or the autobios
graphical writers. Although Miss
Ferbel‘ admits that mally’ times
in the past She has flatly stated,‘
“Never, never, if 1 live to he one
hundred and ten years old and
can look back on myself as having
been a pleasing blend of the
Duchess of Windsor, Cleopatra
and Eleanor Roosevelt, w\ll I write
my autobiography tor the delecta-
tion of a gaping wolld," she has
had to retract these words hecauso
she too felt that she had to “Stop'
Look! Listenli" She hoped that
If she could go back to the spot
from which She started, and r
tracc her steps ever so carefully,
she might learn where she along
with the rest of the world during

S. Nollen, and Robert IIolquist,

Ithe last decade, lost her bearings
:and missed the way. The result
of this retracing of steps is her
autobiography, “A Peculiar Tress
ure."

But her autobiography is no res
trcat into the world of the past.
no attempt to find an escapist‘s
oasis of order in a desert of dem-
agoguery, For Miss Ferber writes
not only of her own lite and her
struggle to succeed, although this
in itself would make an interest-
ing enough biography, she writes
also of the struggle of her people,
the Jews, in the world persecution
today.

She is proud that she is Jewish;
she has always been proud, she
claims, even when she, as a child,
was tormented hy small town big-
otry in ottumiva, Iowa. When a
reporter once asked her to what
she attributed her success, she
blurted out, “Well, 1 think if I've
had any success, it's because i
was born a Jew” She was not
surprised when the reporter re-
fused to print that

Thus, Miss Fel‘ber meets the
issue of her racial inheritance
squarely without evasion Her
most eloquent plea, however, is
not for her people aloneibut ror
the preservation oi democratic
ideals and tolerance in America.
Throughout the book thcrc is an
almost Fourth or July patriotism
for the Anicrica that she loves so
well.

“A Peculiar Treasure" is far
more exciting and significant than
any of her novels. The book is
just what the title implies, “a pe-
culiar trcasnre" for Americans.
who welcome one more defending:
voice for tolerance against the;
threatening force of bigotry.
