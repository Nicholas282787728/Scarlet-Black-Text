ment and re-statcnient of the themes.
there is a coda, the material of which
is taken from the “Symphony ofi
Triumph", with which the tragedy of
Egmont is brought to its conclusion.

Second on the program is the
“Largo” from the the “New World,
Symphony" by Dvorak, which was
written in New York in 1893 while
the Bohemian composer was direc-
tor of the National Conservatory of
Music Dvorak was greatly interest-
ed in the development of an Ameri-
can type of music based on Indian
and negro music. He is said to have
been inspired to write this famous
movement by reading Longfellow's
“Hiawatha".

After solemn chords are intoncd
by the brasses and woodwinds as an
introduction, a plaintive melody,
known to many by its arrangement
as a song to the words, "Going
Home' is given out by the English
horn over sustained harmonies by the
strings.
Flute. Oboe Prominent

In the second part of the “Largo",
a new melody by the flute and oboe is
introduced, with tremolo accompani»
ment by violas and second violins.

Market for Sugar
Constitutes Great

Problem of Cuba

The Cuban revolution is basically
economic, and the keynote of tiic
whole situation is sugar, the chief
industry, according to Myron Koc-
nig who spoke on the Cuban uprisir
ings before the Sunday Evening club
Sunday. “Cuba's greatest problem.”
he stated, “will be to find a market
for this sugar, Worldwide efforts are
being made to regulate production."

Mr. Koenig traced brieﬂy the his-
tory of Cuba from the time of Columr
bus, pointing out the central racial,
economic, and social factors, and es-
pecially the class struggle between
the aristocratic Spanish creoles and
the masses of Negro laborers He ai-
so remarked that the Platt amends
ment in which the Cubans first ao-
quiesced has been regarded by them
as an imposition on the part of the
United States.

"This has been the first successful
Cuban revolution. with the govern-
ment recognized by thc United
States, and with a spirit of Selfrrler
tcrmination, the Cubans are now on-
tcring upon a new era,” declared Mr.
Kocnig.

POETRY GROUP MEETS

Original poems were read and dies
cussed by the members of the new
poetry group at their birmonthly
meeting Sunday evening. This group
has been organized by Miss Grace
Hunter, instructor of English, to
create interest in this type of litcra-
ture on the campus. The next mcet»
ing of the group will be Feb. 25 at
the College club.

at 9:40 a. m., the last lecture, ”Faith
in God and Man,” will be delivered.
criticizing modern humanism, the
speaker claimed in his talk this morn.
ing that its proponents do not speak
in the name of the true God. To them,
he said, Cod is man at his best,- and
religion treats of man's striving for
greater perfection. The humanist, he
continued, considers civilization suf—
ficient unto itself and true relation-
ship with God as unnecessary.
Retain Idealism

Idealism should not be abandoned,
but must be of necessity, the speaker
asserted, unless faith in man is aug-
mented by faith in God.

If religion were divorced from
civilization it would mean the ulti—
mate dccay of culture, Mr. Tittle
averred, and civilization divorced
from religion would mean the decay
of faith.

Faith Needed

“Modern religion has lost its vital-
ity because reli ious faith is condi-
tioned to contemporary society and
to individual personality.” the speak-
er stated, adding that as life has be
come depersonalized, God has oe-
come correspondingly impersonalln
concluding, the Rev. Mr. Tittle de-
clared that the need for personal re-
ligion is extremely desperate today
and made a plea for the restoration
of individual religious faith,

Revolt Against
Prestige

The modern revolt against autlioiu
ity is a revolt against the external
authority of prestige and power as
seen in the teachings of parents, pro-
fessors and the dictatorial state, the
Rev. Mr, Tittle said in his second
lecture Tuesday evening, on “Free-
(lDl‘n and Authority.”

More than ever before there is a
desire [or authority and truth to
bring certainty to modern life, the
speaker asserted, citing as evidence
the appearance of the dictatorial
state, the present leanings of the
people toward the Roman Catholic
church, and the eagerness with which
