Ryan, BIum Recital Termed
‘Distinctly Supericr’ by Critic

Finds 'Usual Excellence
Present 'in Program
Monday Night

 

By liiehnrd liiinrl
With the characteristic excel-
lence of previous programs which
they have presented to Grinnell
audiences. Mrs Elsie Haggard
Ryan and Mr. Elias Blllm gave a
distinctly superior piano»organ l'es

cital on Monday evening. The
opening “Concerto in D minor"
oi" Bach indicated Mrs. Ryml'

 

and Mr. Bllllll's very real musi-
cianship.

The composition began in unison,
but quickly went into the weaving
and intricate passages for which
Each is famous. The precise exe-
cution of these sinuous passages
eVidenced musical skill as well as
diligent work for proper exposi-
tion of the nun-then The adagio
of this concerto was especially
impressive in its sombre and grave
yet decided movement. It pre-
pared the listener for what was
to burst out in the movement
which followed, the allegro mode-
rato, in which motion was accen-
tuated by a bright and glowing
eheerfulness that graduated into
ii double forte ending.

Expressive interpretation

Mrs. Ryan's expressive and
agreeable interpretation of Mens
delsohn's “Variations Serieuses“
lifted her to an even higher de-
gree of artistic recognition. She
displayed welcome fiery playing,
and lightness and accuracy in
these parts which demanded that
consideration. The audience felt
she surpassed the good playing
she has done for us heretofore.

The lilting theme of the Franck
allegretto was enchanting in its
loveliness and delectable qualities
One might detect a mournful but
evasive strangeness in its melody;
yet'it was pleasantly appealing.
The experience of playing it must
have been good fun for the per-
formers: they did it well.

Created Mystic Illusion

Suint»Saen3 "Fantasia in D flatn
played as an organ solo by Mr.
Blum. created a mystic llhlsion‘
with its quiet calmness and tram
quillity; then it melted into light.
brilliant chord sequences. The
charm of the selection lay in the
interpretation of the fancy and
whimsey which Saint-Sachs wrote
into this music. The ai-peggio and
flute»like ending of the compo-

sition was like musical notes
hurrying through gossamer in
some imaginative Wood, IVII‘.

Blum again reminded us of his
great facility‘in the manipulation
of a pipe organ. He added another
laurel to the many he already has.

The two Guilmant compositions

 

served as a light finish to an
otherwise heavy program. The
gayety and varying moods of the
“Scherzo Capriccioso” approached

the clown-like in aspect. It was
fresh and invigorating, and a
illnppy selection with which to end

a pleasant evening. The “Pasto-
.rale" was sui- 'ounded by a mellow
[loveliness which transferred itself
lvery quickly to a receptive
I audience.

STANDARDIZED

UNIFORMITY

The simple mechanical details of cigarelte
manufacture are of surprising imporiance.
Upon them depend the physical properties_
of the cigarette, such as weight, size, firm-
ness,moisture-holding properiies,uniformily
of fill—uniformity of product—all of which
have a far-reaching effect on ihe character of
its combustion and ihe consiituents ofits smoker
In the inanufclciure of Lucky Strike Ciga-
rettes all of these properties have been
standardized with care for the perfection»

of A LIGHT SMOKE.
