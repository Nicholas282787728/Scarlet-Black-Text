Weak at Center
Coach Truesdaie is pleased with
the general showing of his team, al-
though he has not been satisfied with
the showing of the center candidates.
Paul Edman, returning veteran in
that position, is not playing his best,
but if he is taken from the lineup,
the mentor is forced to sacrifice
height and reach. Duncan and Rowe
are both capable of handling the
pivot assignment and Waite and
I“ ve work into the lineup well, but
h short guards, rangy forwards
are almost a necessity.
McCreai-y and Ullrich have been
‘doing regular work at the guards with
Christoffeisen seeing action intermit-
tently. Duncan is handling the left
forward job while rtowe is at right
forward, going to center occasionally.
The latter is setting the scoring pace
for the Grinnell team.

It seems a pity that the college stir

:and celebrate homecoming by annoy-
‘ing- the students and by drinking pro—
fusely,

What wore the names of the alumni
who were drinking that night? Do
ltlioy have any more right to drink on
itlie campus than the students? They
'bring the drinks in. have their fun,
,and then slop merrily olltileaving'
\the entire mess to be cleaned up by
ithc students, and the blame to be
Ibolnc on their shoulders,

! hiercly because the men of the col-
;lcge saw that the students were duly
3p ‘llshed, rather than letting the mat.

matter, the whole school, has been
igivoh a black eye. Had we let the
