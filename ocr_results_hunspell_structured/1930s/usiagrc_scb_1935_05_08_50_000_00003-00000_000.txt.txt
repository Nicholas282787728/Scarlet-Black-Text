Science Invent: Instrument
to Measure Span of Life

Washington, D. Cr—(ACP)~Science
has come through again, this Lime
with a device to accurately measure
a person’s life span.

At the meeting of the National Acad.
amy of Sciences, the discovery of a
“life-speedometer" was announced by
Dr. Felix Bernstein, formerly of
the University of Goettingen,
in Germany, and now v' 'turg pro.
fessor at Columbia university, New
York City, The method and appar—
atus may be likened to an instrument
which combines the functions of a
speedometer and a gasoline guage,
Before announcing his discovery, Dr.
Bernstein determined with an accur—
acy that was startling and almost un-
canny the life expectancy of about
2,500 individuals in Germany, whose
deaths occurred at the calculated time.
In his search for a means of measure
ing the ageing processes of the body,
Dr. Bernstein found the key to be hid.
den away in the human eye. In the
eye of every individual, he discovered,
lies the answer to the riddle nearly
every man and woman past middle age
ask, "How long am i going to live?"
