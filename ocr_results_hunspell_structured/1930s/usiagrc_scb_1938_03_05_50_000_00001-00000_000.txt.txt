Flags to Merge
Before Baton
Here Friday

The Little Philharmonic orches-
tra which will appear in Herrick
chapel Friday under the direction
of George H. Shapiro, includes
artists from Russia, Denmark,
Norway, Holland, Austria, Czecho-
s1ovakia, Mexico and the United
states.

However, racial and religious
differences seldom occur under
the baton, according to Shapiro.

The orchestra knows no prob4
lenis of Nazism, Fascism, Semi-
tism, Communism or Socialism.

“If there are any personal dif-
ferences, they never come to the
fore during rehearsals," said Mr.
Shapiro who has been conducting
orchestras 25 years.

"My only problem is that of
temperament, 1f music soothes
the beast, it surely acts as a
peace maker for men."

It took Mr. Shapiro more than
a year's negotiation to form the
Little Philharmonic orchestra,
which has just completed two
years at the Play house, .Chicago.

Lion Calm, Play’s Cast Crowded
In ‘Androcles’ Performance

t.

‘Thumbs Up’ Verdict
of Reviewer on
Duncan, Hagan

By Carl Niemeyer

It is a curious fact that the
most spectacular play produced
by the Grinnell college department
of drama should also be the most
thoughtful one; but so it proved
when on Thursday night after a
long period of gestation “And-
rocles and the Lion” was finally
brought forth before an admiring
audience.

The spectacle, complete with
Roman soldiers, gladiators, early
‘Christians, and a decadent emper-
or, was important; but more im-
portant, as Sara Sherman Pryor
had directed the play, was Shaw's
conviction that Christian humility,
:though noble and beautiful, is
1 still not a solution for the world's
‘problems.

The most important member of
lthc cast, aside, of course, from
lRobert Hogan’s engaging lion,
lwho looked like W. E. Gladstone
land behaved like a lovable child,
iwas Androcles, played by Harry
Duncan. In the drama Andi-ocles

Drake Team Rallies

Cagers, 33-30

The Drake cagers put on a

of a series of miscues by the Pio-

game of the season for both
teams by a 33-30 score.

The two teams put on a slow,
low-scoring first half, which
found the Pioneers trailing by a
14-10 score. After halftime Wil—
bur Luick got hot for a few min-
utes and dropped in three field
goals. At the same time Conwill
dropped in a few, and Dean and
Berry scored to give the Pio-
neers a 23723 lead with five min-
utes left to play.

With the game virtually salted
away, the Pioneers suffered amine
mcntary lapse and threw the ball
away three times. Each time it
recovered by Drake, and
each one was turned into a has—

fought furiously and magnifi—

Both teams played good ball
