Rev. LeaviH'

Sees Man in
Greai Crisis

Failure of Speaker
To Explain Terms
Brings Criticism

By Duane McAncney

“It is vital to look into the
modern trends of religious thinkr
ing," said Rev, Ashley Day Lea-
vitt in the first of the Gates lec—
tures.

i-le asserted that we are mak~
ing religious progress. There is
crisis on about us; however, any
crisis which lasts over a long
period of time ceases to be a
crisis and becomes a condition un-
der which men live and survive
All writers and readers use the
crisis to preface the material
they write and thus interpret the
conditions all over the world.
Born in a Crisis

Rev. Leavitt stated that we in
the present generation were born
in a crisis and we will live and
die in one.

“The correlation of revelation
is not knowledge but faith, and
faith is the-acceptance of the in—
comprehensible. Correlation to
faith is obedience,” stated Rev.
Leavitt in closing.

Beul- Reviews.

Friday morning, Charles Bear
gave a chapel review of the lec-
turers. He stated that in refer-
ence to Dr. Leavitt‘s ideas of
obedience, we as students could-
n’t follow his lin'e of thought. Dr.
Leavitt seemed to be progressive
in some of his ideas, but he con»
tradicted himself in that he
thought that “one should be child-
like in obedience, unquestioning in
attitude, and get off his feet and
let himself go," “This statement,"
Bear said, “cannot be comprise
bonded by the ordinary student."

“Nothing should separate us
from the love of God,” said Rev.
Leavitt in his second Gates lec<
lure.

Kellglon a Business.

The prime objective of the
world today is to make a better
world tomorrow. Religion is a
business, and the business of re-
ligion is to make the bad people
good, banish evil and establish
justice.

He went on to say that the
soul is not a hit of luggage. We

ics upon his debut last season, is
again being sponsored by s.

Unlike most prodigies, young

appearance until he was 13, when
Italy’s concert managers besieged
him with offers, only a portion of
which his teacher and mentor,
Theodore Pashkus, permitted him
to accept.

Since that initial tour of Italy
in 1933, however, he has given a
recital in the Konzerthaus of his
native city, and concertised
through the Baltic state, accom-
panied at the piano by Walter
Taussig, now assistant music di-
rector of the Salzburg Opera
Guild. '

His concert in Milan in Jan-
uary 1936 was sponsored by Vic-
(or Bahata, revered successor to
Toscanini in Italy; and in August
that same year he. played the
Paganini .Conerto in Ostend with
Albert Wolff conducting theor—
chestra.

As a tribute to the youthful
artist’s technical brilliance, Emil
Herrmann, founder of the stradi-
varius Memorial association, lent
Renardy a $45,000 Stradivarius
violin with which he Completed
his last season's schedule.

Blacklisted ‘Freshwomen’ Take
Punishment for Prepping Sins

By Nancy McMurray,

RRRRRRR'lp. They‘re sitting
down! Bangecl‘ash. They're try-
mg to get through the swinging
half of the front door of the
ARHI (So is everybody else.)
allows!!! They are at home!

Hold your hats, folks, and dun‘t
crowd. It's only the blackballed
“freshwomen” undergoing gall
and wormwood for failing to live
up to the League Board’s stan-
dards of how the well-behaved
“freshwoman” acts.

The League Board says that all
“freshwomsn” girls who “slip the
noose” during prepping suffer for
their sins. They shall wear their
clothes backwards on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays. They
shall leave make-up off, and they
shall carry their books in Sull-
cases.

Thus the rips, the bangs, and
the exclamation mar-ks. Clothes,
not being made for reverse styles,
don’t stand the strain so well, es-
pecially wben the poor girls, worn

 

out from lugging their suitcases
to the third floor of the ARH,
plop down too whole-heartedly on
the unsympathetic classroom
chairs,

The bangs and crashes andgcne
eral wear and tear are the result
of the ‘freshwomel-l" trying to get
through the door with their suit-
cases three seconds before the [are
rly bell rings. imagine a “freslh
woman" trying to lam a suitcase
two inches wider than the work-
ing half of the ARI-I door through
so she can get through herself.
Imagine anybody getting through

,As for the exclamation marks,
we are sorry the original can’tbe
printed. They were heard through
the half-open doors in the Corn-
rlors of Main, Mcars and Firm
Tree cottages, The “fl‘esllwomen”
were very much at home.

What with the rips, bangs and
exclamations, the upper class—
women are enjoying themselves.
What's funny is that the “fresh-
Women” are having a good time,
too.

Lester Shepard, shove, played
his last game of collegiate foot-
ball this afternoon. Shepard, a
170 pound tackle, has played
inspired method in his line po—
sition all season.

Passes'for 2

Touchdowns

13 Seniors Play
Fast, Clever Final
»Game for Pioneers

By Edward L. Wilson.

Grinnell 21, Colorado college 7
tells the story of the pioneers last
game as members of the Missouri
Valley conference this afternoon
on Word field.

Playing his last game of inter<
collegiate football, Fred Homann
paced his team mates by scoring
one touchdown, throwing two pas-
ses which resulted in touchdowns,
and rolling up yardage.

However, after Colorado college
slipped over a touchdown in the
early minutes of the second half,
Grinnell took charge of the play
for the remainder of the game.

Early in the second quarter, Ho-
mann carried the ball into scoring
position and then tossed a touch-
down pass to Ed Walters. High
kicked for the point.

About a minute before the half
ended, Homann repeated his ear-
lier performance, Max Shelton's
kick going wide.

Two minutes after the kickoff
in the second half, the Tigers, led
by Norman Trainor and Louis Wit-
tecar, scored their only lone touch-
down.

Trainor plowed through the
Grinnell resistance to score and
Joe Aldendifer kicked the extra
point.

Midway in the third quarter,
Grinnell scored again after recov-
ering a fumble on the Colorado
29 yard line. Homsnn dashed
around left end to score from the
6 yard line. High missed the
kick.

After having a scoring threat
nipped on the Synod line, Grinnell
broke through the Colorado line
to spill Tremor for a safety.
