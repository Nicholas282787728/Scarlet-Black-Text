Problems
Recommending in t c r n a tional

control of colonial areas to “guar-
antee economic equality for all and

to ease the psychological effect of i

prestige" which colonial posseSe
sions bring, Dr. Grover Clark spoke
Friday morning on “Balance Sheets
of Imperialism" at the first in the
series of International Relations
Conference lectures.

Europe continues her colonial
expansion despite economic and
political disadvantages, explained
Dr, Clark, because of the reason of
prestige, the “psychology and emo-
tional appeal of ownership of large
territories being a very real thing,”
because such expansion has been
profitable for certain business in-
terests and because modern indus-
try within a certain country lee
quires control of raw materials by
that country.

“Moral justification of some-
thing economically profitable has
always been characteristic of l'mr
periallsm," he said in reviewing
the history of the pioblem.

one of the justifications for im-
perialism has been that additional
colonies would provide an outlet
for increasing population. “One
might go on indefinitely showing
the absurdity of figures which are
given to prove that Europe must
have additional territory for mi-
gration," Dr. Clark said. As an
example, he quoted figures Show-
ing that the net migration from
Europe to Africa in the last 50

Harold Row '39, was elected stu.
dent director of the men's social

Fresh Women
Distinguished
by Red Ribbons

Upperclsss women are gloating
7the freshman girls are finally
being prepped! It's a mild form
of prepping, no ‘buttoning,t' no
"hell-week," no red and black
caps. Instead, each freshman girl
is wearing an eight-inch strip of
red ribbon, usually as a bow in
her hair, so she will know her
own classmates and not go around
opening doors or answering tele-
phones for freshmen by mistake.

Every noon a freshman is sta-
tioned on each floor of James,
Haines, and Read cottage, to an-
swer the telephone for half an
hour. During this period, upper—
classmen may ask them to per—
form smail duties, such as stack-
ing rooms, making beds, and
emptying waste-baskets.

Preps don't seem to mind the
new regime; some of them even
declare it tun, and all agree that
it's accomplishing the League
Board's purpose of getting the
different classes better acquaint-
ed. Upperclass women are heart—
ily in favor of the plan. some of
them even wanting to extend it
to darning stockings and washing

 

clothes.
