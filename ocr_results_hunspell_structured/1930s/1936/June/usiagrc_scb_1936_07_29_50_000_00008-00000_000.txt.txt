At, present, plans regarding the
use of Pioneer hall enol Manning
house are not definite.
Beetty's office may be moved
from its present location to Pioe
neer. white Manning house may
quarter college employees.

Tltis is an open letter to
those of you who are new and
maybe a little bewildct'ad
about nrhat sort of clalltcs to
bring to college. We've heat!
that may out'sclvcs and want
to help.

Dear lane,

1 was so glad to get your letter
and to learn tltat you are coming
to Crinncll. You'll love it! Herc
is an answer lo the questions you
aslr about what to wear.

The August numbers of the
woman's magazines have numerous
articles on the correct wardrobe for
college, and you will get an excel-
lent idea of the fall fashions from
consulting them —- for instance
skirts are definitely shorter—four-
teen inches from the floor for all
day clothes, cven formal afternoon
dresses if you want to be very new.
The new silllaucllc is brand in the
shoulders. exlremely fitted lltrouglt
the bodice and distinctly flared in
the skirt. (Shorter slrirls are al-
ways fuller.)

We hear that dress coats are
smartest in black and that the fit-
ted, Princess style is going to be
tops. Sports coats still follow the
swagger lines so good last spring.
Fur coats deport further from curt-
servative lines than for some timci
Personally I don‘t care a lot for
all the trial: gadgets of metal and
wood used to fasten them, prefer»
ring the less mechanical contrivan-
cos lilrc military frogs ar coveted
buttons. but to be this year's fur
coat your caracul or lapin or lco-

pard shin must be held together by '

something that loo/gs as though it
came off a pirate chest. If you
trove been saving up for a new
coat, one of the smooth furs in a
modified cut will serve every Pu".
pose. But don't thinlr you have to
have a fur coat to come to college.

out the glamour in you.

There are plenty of formal din-
ners and dances at Crinnell and I
want you to go to all of them. If
you're to have only one formalr a
black or white with a faclfcl in a
contrasting color will Ina/{e every-
one thinlg you have two. For the
less formal open house occasions,
wear the iaclfclr for the formal
danccs leave it offl Howcvcrr if
you're going to have more than
one. get one in a high color, quite
formal in cat, and another a little
less hard to live up to and more
like your own simple self (but not
too frou-froa, you're a college girl
now). Tolrc the advice of your
aunt Katie and don't buy a formal
with a train. They look nice in
the pictures but are a menace to all
concerned and will malre crcry turtt
around tho dance floor a harrowing
experience. An evening wrap is
not necessary, but if you have some
graduation money left, a vctvet or
velvolccn one, with or without a fur
collar. will moire you feel all docs-
sed up.

Lounging pajamas, a flannel
tube or a negligac are the thing for
your evenings at home with your
studying not are quite correct for
spreads anti midnight feasts too.

One last word. Don't feel that
you have to bring a lot of clothes
to college. There are places here
which specialize in campus clollles.
Virginia Swishcr’s shop on Fourth
avenue always has smart, youthful
dresses and suits, featuring the dc—
