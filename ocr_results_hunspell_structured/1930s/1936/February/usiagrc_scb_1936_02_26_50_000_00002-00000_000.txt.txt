bility that the record in the half-
mile may be lowered by Schlotter-
beck. He set a new course record
on Grinnell's 19 lap track this
week by running the distance in
2:07 minutes and has a good
chance of lowering the existing
record of 1:59.33 on Drake‘s 12 lap
track Friday night.

The mile relay is Grinnell‘s oth-
er prospect for a first place, Duke
declared. , The same four men who
ran on the team which defeated
Iowa two weeks ago will, probably
run against Drake, he Said, They
are: Barnes, Hess, Schlotterbeck

cities in hopes of gaining success,
But only a few succeeded and the
remainder joined the proletarian
poor. “You in America should prc»
serve your rural areas to aid in
solving your unemployment prob-
Iems,” Mr, Kagawa said ‘n pleadv
ing for a “back to the soi move-
ment as a means of alleviating the
suffering of those who are unem-
ployed.

In Japan the same trend was
apparent, but with the coming of
the depression, three- million Japa-
nese’ moved back to the farms, and
thus avoided some of the hard-
ships of the economic dislocation.

Dislikes Economic Violence

Mr. Kagawa does not believe in
economic violence as a means of
securing the rearrangemcnt of so-
ciety. “Young men are Impatient,"
hc sai “They want action, but
they do not realize ethat such is
not the way of achieving their
ends. The present bloodshed in
Japan is an example of the haste
of youth " he explained. He pointed
out that more people died of star-
vation during the Red revolution,
than were killed in the actual ware
fare,

“There must be a cooperation
and coordination between labor
and capital,” he said. He pointed
out that never has the dictator-
ship of the laboring classes been
successful. In 1871 during the dome
inanee of the Paris commune,
there was great suffering in Par-
is. “Labor can manufacture the
materials, but if they cannot be
sold, then the products are use-
less." The Reds in Russta in 19177
19 found that such was true and
now have abandoned their commu-
nistic ideas for the idea of cooper-
atlves.

According to Mr. Kagawa, the
object of any cooperative move-
ment should be to give the profits
of the organization to the poorest
members. He sees in the present

cooperative movement the only
solution of the present economic
chaos, and cheerfully believes that
if the 65 nations of the world can
get together and cooperate, all of
the difficulties will be smoothed
out.
