A GROWING INTEREST

Evidence of a growing interest in and
appreciation of the annual presentation of an
all-Bach program l ' the ‘e’sper chair and
orchestra was seen Sunday afteruon when.
(l ‘pite the extremely frigid weather, a snrpl
ingly large/number of music-lovers gathered in
the chapel to listen to our of the most outstand-

LET FREEDOM RING!

(Dni - Northwestern)

Of late the air has been rent with loud hcllow-
ing of the American Liberty league. This group,
claimant to the defense of American liberty, actual-
ly is a champion of the "status gun.” The League
asserts that the American people wish to return to
the sc-called “good old days,” (of twc cars in the
finance company's hands and two chickens in every
garage).

Let’s look at the “Liberty" league. Last year
it received $433,175 and spent $389,973, It paid,
among other things, a salary and expense of over
351.000 to its head, ouc Jouette Shousc.

Now where did all this money come from? Yes,
of course it came from the pockets of American peo-
ple who believed that their liberty needed defending.
Well, that's two points for our side, now let's play
again. .

As the League’s publicity man, Al Smith. would
say, ”let’s look at the record!’ Let’s find out just
who these stout yeomen, who rise in defense of their
so-called rights, really are. Surely they must be
honest farmers or factory wcrkers who chafe under
the yoke of New Deal policies. Who are these peo-
ple? _
The record shows that so per cent of the checks
contributed and amounting to $138,000 come from
no less a group than the dii Pout family. other con-
tributing yeomen were Alfred P. Sloan of General
Motors fame, our dear friend. John J. Raskob, the
Bankers Trust company at New York, the Phillips
Petroleum company and other financial groups who
gave a total of $133,500.

Here wc have a delightful little group of pec-
ple who attempt to give the impression they genuine-
ly represent the voice of the nation. It is they who
pay the expenses of the American Liberty league.
People who pay salaries usually give the orders.
Just. to make it more fun we‘ll let you guess whose
“liberty" is embodied in the American Liberty

‘league.
