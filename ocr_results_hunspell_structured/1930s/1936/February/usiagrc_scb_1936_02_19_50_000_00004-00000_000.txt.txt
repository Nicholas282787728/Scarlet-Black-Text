Missionaries

Aid Orient

What is tiie good or sending out
missionaries to tar countries, was
the question raised hy Dr. Bhashcr
l=. Hivnle, protessor of philosophy
at wilsoii college at Bomha . Ill»
dia, in his chapel talk Monday
morning.

in answoiing his o\\ll (illz‘stio'l
he pointed out that “athoIIgh
the Oriental countries have a fine
civilization of their own. neverthe-
less there is a definite good do
rived {mm the sending of missions
aries, critics of the system not-
withstanding."

“This is achieved," he stated, “as ,

a result of the introduction of the
idea of developing the individual
soul, a doctrine which had not been

heard of in the orient before. This‘

introduction, through the medium
of Christianity, has resulted in the
raising of the common people in
thc.social organization in
East.”

Another benefit is that the hue-
sionaries tend to counteract the
poor opinions Easterners often
gain of western civilization
through reading some of the lite -
sry dregs of the West. “American
womanhood is being laughed at as
a result," the speaker explained,
“but this opinion is heingoffset by
the missionary work."

ruined the Iowan's title aspirations

' Mar 'iioonl slips

Hopes for a victory have ins
creased considerably with the sud-
den scoring decline of Roy Martin-
toni, last year's Valley leader, who
this year has been unable to score
consistently of late.

Against the st. Louis university
team, the Pioneers should have no
difficulty, having already annexed
one victory over the blue and white
in a tilt played here earlier in the
month. The Billikans are handi-
capped hy the lack of veteran mar
ten'al. having only two lettermen
available, Capt. Herb Fash and
Dave Mattie, both of whom an-
nexed six points in the first tilt.

The balance of the tank team,‘

other than the two captains, will
be composed of members of last
year's frosh aggregation, This
needed strength has been reduced,
however, by the loss of three men
during the early part of the traine
ing season, Jim Davis, distance
man, was forced to quit because of
sinus trouble, while Fred Fergu-
son, likewise a distance man, drops
ped swimming altogether. The
third loss was the failure of
George Holcomb to become eligible
for the second semester.

take his events, the 100 and 220
