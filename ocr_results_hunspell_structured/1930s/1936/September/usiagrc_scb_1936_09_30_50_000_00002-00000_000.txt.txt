Spencer Announces Rules
for Cecil Rhodes

Competition

Applications for Rhodes scholar-
ships must be turned in before
November 7, Prof. E. B. T. Spen-
cer, Grinnell representative, an-
nounced yesterday. The Scholar
ships provide for two years at
Oxford university in England on
a stipend of four hundred pounds
a year.

To be eligible, a candidate must
he a male citizen of the United
States, and unmarried; be between
the ages of 19 and 25 on Oct. 1,
1937; and have completed at least
his sophomore year by the time
of application.

The scholarships were founded
by Cecil John Rhodes, South Af»
rlcan diamond millionaire, in his
will. Thirty~two of them are
awarded in the United States each
year, divided equally among eight
districts of six states each.

Four groups of qualities were
listed by Mr. Rhodes’ will as neces-
sary for candidates. They are
(a) literary and scholastic ability
and attainments, (b) qualities of
manhood. truth, courage, devotion
to duty, sympathy, kindllness,
unselfishness, and fellowship;
(c) exhibition of moral force of
character and of instincts to lead
and to take an interest in his
schoolmates; (d) physical vigour,
as shown by interest in outdoor
sports or in other ways.

“Any man interested in apply-
ing for one of the scholarships
should see me as soon as possible,"
Mr. Spencer said.

The drama department allotment
of 2 per cent was left the same
as last year, while the Student
council appropriation was in—
creased from 1 to 1.75 per cent in
order to take care of the increased
expense incurred with the estab—
lishment of the new, universal col—
lege auditing plan.

Men’s debate allotment was re-
duced from 2 per cent to 1.75,
while the mods appropriated for
the Women’s debate was left the
same, 1 per cent.

The Women's Athletic assoc'
tion was again given an appropii —

shows the Cyclone safety men
were able to return 23 Tutor punts
only 87 yards, or less than four
yards a try. Also, the figures
show that the 23 punts went for
an average of 36 yards, which is
good kicking with a heavy, wet
ball. The most important fact,
however, is that the Tutors trav—
elled down under their punts so
fast as to prevent the Ames safe—
ty men to an average of little
over three yards on each luck.

 

Ricky Boiler, who in the two
Pioneer games played this season
has shown himself to be an out-
standing defensivc player, was not
in uniform last night, remaining
on the sidelines in an effort to r
cover from a badly bruised hi
incurred Friday. His return to
the starting lineup for the game
with the Teachers Saturday after-
noon is almost a certainty.

Joe Woodward, Tangy sophomore
‘end who received a back injury
last week, reported Tuesday and
may see service Saturday. Preston
Evans, former East High, Des
Moines star, is also expected to be
ready for service this week, hav-
ing recovered from a torn muscle
received during the first few days
of practice.

Line-up Unrcrmin

The Pioneer coach was uncer-
tain yesterday as to who would
get the first call Saturday after-
noon. s. probable starting line-
up, bowever, may include Boiler
and Klein at ends, Graves and
Moore at tackles, West, High,
Spence, or Woodward at guards,
capt. Bill Fowler at center, and
McLeod, Homan, Snow, and
Schlotterbeck in the backfield.

Lookabaugh emphasized, how's
ever, that no deﬁnite starters
were picked as yet, and that he
probably would repeat last week’s
tactics of using many substitir
tions.

Saturday's game will
eighth consecutive game in as
many years with the State
Teachers eleven. The last seven
resulted in four victories, one
loss, and two tied games for the
Pioneers. Last year’s encounter,
played on Ward field, ended in a
seven to seven tie.

Four games were played with
the Tutors previous to the begin-
ning of the present series. and of
these Griunell won two and lost
two, bringing the all time total to
Six Pioneer wins, three losses, and
two ties.

Loop Teams
Open Season

Five Conference Schools
Win Saturday

By Wells Barnett

with Drake leading the way
with a 52-5 victory over Simpson,
five of the seven Missouri valley
conference football teams won
games against non-conterence op-
ponents this week-end in what
was the season opener for most
of the schools. The only defeat
of the week was suffered by Okla»
home A. 8c M., which bowed to
Oklahoma city university by a
9-6 score.

0n the basis of this week’s
showing Drake loomed far above
the other loop teams as a strong
contender for the conference grid
title, although some difference of
opinion has been expressed as to
whether Drake was phenomenally
strong against Simpson, or Simp-
son phenomenally weak against
Drake.

chs Are strong

Washington university of St.
Louis will also be a strong con—
tender on the basis of Saturday‘s
game, when the Bears defeated
Bradley Tech by a 32-0 score.
And Creighton can hardly be dis
counted after defeating South
Dakota by a 254) score.

Grinneu's Pioneers, after barely
nosing out central college at Pella
two weeks ago, showed remarks
able improvement Friday in de-
feating Cornell 12‘s in what was
termed by some writers a “mild
upset." The scarlet and black
team came back in the third
quarter to score two touchdowns
in quick succession after trailing
6—0 at halftime, then played smart
football to protect their narrow
lead for the rest of the game.

Drake will have a better chance
to demonstrate its superiority this
Friday when they will meet a
fairly strong squad from coe,
which will probably be better able
to fumish opposition than was
Simpson.

Grinnell will have its hands
full in tackling Iowa State Teach-
