A DESPICABLE RACKET

Each successive spring for the last sev-
eral years has seen a large number of pro—
spective Grinnellians entertained on the cam-
pus by the Department of Public Relations.

Each successive spring has also seen a
large number of persons supposedly interest-
ed in Grinnell entertained on the campus by
thell friends at the expense of the college.

Since Grinnell has changed her policy
and has begun an attempt to interest high
school graduates in Grinnel], this new racket
has sprung up.

It occurs all too many times that when a
student intends to entertain friends on the
campus for a house party or dance, the bill is
paid by the college because someone has rep-
resented his friends as prospective students.

This is not only unfair to the college and
to the Department of Public Relations, but
it is dishonest as well. There is no reason why
Grillnell college should entertain large mim-
bers of persons each year who have no idea of
attending college here, And it certainly
seems like a despicable racket. J N

MAKING WAR VOTING UNNECESSARY
(University 01 Texas)

One of the most interesting proposals for ovoid-
ing wsr brought forward in many years was that
presented by Colonel Arthur Little, is World\war
veteran, who enlisted as is private and came out as
a major with eight decorations for conspicuous valor
and service. His plan reads:

“Before this country engages in any War, ex—
cept to repel invasion, let the question of our cn-
tering‘ upon such an engagement be the subject of a
nation-wide referendum. Let the vote be by s gned
ballot (no secret ballot). Have each affirmative vote
so worded as to constitute s pledge of enlistment, or,
if by examination the sff'rmctivc voter should prove
to be unavailable for military, then to constitute a
pledge of, half his or her fortune (in kind) for the
uses of the war for which he or she voles."

Colonel Little’s pla would obviously lessen but
not abolish the possi ty of our going to war. It
might stem, but not stop. Taking for grsnted that
the nation-wide referendum would be held as soon
as pro-war or anti-war spirit was running high in:
stead of when there were mere rumors about wars,
or after public sentiment had already been moulded
by the propagandists, then the outcome of the vote
might serve its purpose.

It is a good idea. It is also a kernel for thought.
An individual would count to 10 several times before
he signed himself into an enlistment. or voted away
half his fortune. The big job. though, is to avoid
any need for such a vote.

The big job is to cleanse the public mind before
the deathly seeds of war have been planted. After
this is done, there will be little possi ty of the
vote going awry.

Irrespective of the fundamental idec upon which
Colonel Little’s proposal rests, one of its best points
is the plan for n vote by open, signed ballot. of
course, this might have certain deficiencies—the em.
ployees of c munitions manufacturer would be hesi—
tant in so crossing their employer#but generally
speaking, there would he no other effective way.

Such a proposal by a man who has bccn exposed
to the horrors of war is doubly potent, Perhaps
when civilization keeps pace with evolution such a
plun will be in effect: or better yet, there will be no
need for any kind of plan to purge humanity of thnt

G
NATIONAL STUDENTS RELIEF
(Reprinted from Tri-City Star)

A new brain child has been bom st Gl-iuncn col-
lege, known as the “National students Relief,"
which claims the support of the lending professors.
following the banishment of the “Veterans of Fur
turc Wars," by President J. s. Nollcn,

Jerome Newcomer of Eldorc, a junior, is being
given credit for this new brain storm, which in—
ciudes proposals for the federal government to g
cvcry boy and girl is college education, and to sub-
lldize athletics,

It is interesting to note thc reaction of profes-
sors to this new idea. Frederick L. Bsumann of the
history department. is quoted as saying: “It is not a
joke, but u sound plan, The American people need
organizations like this one." Prof. Poul Spencer
Wood of the English department, says: “The person
who founded this organization is s genius.” Prof.
Earl D. Strong of the economics department ile-
clares, “1 am all for it,” prof. Laetitia. Moon Con—
srd of the sociology department maintains, “It is
right that every boy and girl in America should
have s college education paid for by the govern-
ment."

It would seem that among the faculty members,
according to Newcomer, only Blsnchc Leonard, in—
structor in education, opposes the plan!

A few years ago such a. brain child would never
have been given serious consideration. Today, how-
rvsr, wc find those who belicvc it should be put into
practice. A college education, in most instances, is
so cssct. Just why the federal government should
be culled upon to give every boy and girl in this
country a college education seems a little far fetched
to say the least, It does show, however, the grow-
ing tendency on the port of many people to believe
that Uncle Sam owes them is living. This is a very
dangerous fallacy.

A college education for every boy and girl
sounds very nice but even if the government did buy
the bill there would be many who would consider it
s four years’ loafiwhiie others would not even be
interested. You cannot force education upon a per-
son.

Putting the government in business is bad
enough, Having it subsidize education and athlet-
ics would be worse. We congratulate the professor
of education at Grimlell. who opposed such a brain
child.

“LET THEM EAT CAI "
(Daily Trojan)

The Grand Old Party has learned nothing what-
ever in its four years of oblivion, if the infest news
reports from Trenton, New Jersey, are to be her
licvcd.

That the idea of emergency relief for
ployed still meets with their disopprovol may be
rend in the news story declaring that “ignoring the
threats and the presence of the Workers Alliance
army of occupction,” Republican leaders of both
houses of the New Jersey legislature this afternoon
drew up a bill to junk the $3,000,000-s-month state
emergency relief setrllp and throw the relief burden
back on the municipalities.

“Ironically, the leaders were forced to meet for
their deliberations in the Carteret club because their
chambers in the stctc house were bcing monopolizcd
by the ‘mock legislature of the Workers' Alliance,“

Republicanism may have its poor qualities but,
up till now, political stupidity has not been one of
them. By refusing thc dcmcnds of a group of work-
ers who thronged the legislative chambcrs and
voiced their sentiments. the G. 0.1». has last several
hundred thousand Votes in the state of New Jersey
slonc.

The new bill is not even c compromise, but pros
vides thst municipalities take over the entire relief
losd, except in instances where they can prove defi-
nitely that they are not capsble cf hcndling it all.
This, the leaders believe, will cffcct c great saving.

A scving to whom? When will they realize
that no matter what ogcncy pays for relief, it is the
citizen whose pocketbook becomes thinner?

“Fears cgcin were being felt today that the
Statehouse may see disturbances tomorrow,” dec
ciares the story, ”inasmuch as the new bill completer
ly ignores the demand of the raggcd army which
has occupied the assembly chombcr dcy and night
for more than a. week."

That, in itself, is c masterly touch of under-
statement. How political leaders can be so near-
sighted, especially with o crucial election due in the
near future, is hard to explain,

"The Eleventh Annual field

this afternoon under the most
favorable of condition: 'm'le shot
put, always uninter sting, was
specially so today. Gray ’9']. put
the shot 34 feet and one inch,
winning first place. This event is
elected for oblivion."

"The hslf mile ibzcyclc race
brought out six contestants with
Storm to set the pace. At lhe
shot, Spring jumps for Storm’s
hind wheel and Heald tack: on
to him. They ride down the back
stretch well hunched.”

“1n the 220-yard dosh the cou-
Lestants lined up‘ at the scratch.
in a few seconds Lh: gun went
off and likewise the men. Rush
took the lead and came tearing
over the line in 22 scoonds, low-
ering the state record one sec-
ond. Everyone was surprised and
the course was re-mecsurcd when
it was found almost correct."
