Backs, LiHemen Exhibit
Ability Thursday

By James Bradley.

Exhibiting flashes of high calibre
football Thursday afternoon, the
spring football squad drove through
the first scrimmage of the season
as Coach Glly Lookabaugh con-
cluded the second week of intone
sive drilling,

The squad composed of fleet
footed backs and heavy linemen
appeared to be nlatle-tosctl'tlel' for
the new double wing brick system
introduced here liy Coach Looka»
baugli. The bulky linemen and the
speedy backs lashed at each other
with the deceptive reverses and
double reverses off the new coach's
formation, the offensive team makr
ing quick thrusts throrigh the line
then circling the ends for runs
which would be touchdown jaunts
in legal contests. Not only the
offense appeared powerful. but the
defensive team seemed like a Gil-
braltsr at times as the offensive
hacks bounced back after hitting
the forward wall.

Show Up Well.

The ball toters who appeared
brightest were Lutlicr, Hoinann,
McLeod and close, not one of these
men weighing over 165 pounds but
all possessing unusual speed, They
were all members of the same
backfield. Luther, Honiann aud
McLeod did all the ball carrying
while Close took over the blocking
duties in great fashion. Homann
also did spectacular blocking.
hurtling would—be tscklers to the
turf like a veteran. McLeod is the
only upperclassmsn of the four
men.

The linemen who opened gaping
/ holes in the defensive line for this
array of backs were Capt. Fowler,
center; ”Ed" Woodward, guard;
John Spence, guard; Berger Grav-
es and Tom Sawyer, tackles, and
Roy Crossman and Walter Klein,
ends. The last three men nanied
are freshmen while the first four
are veterans. Only Spence and
Crossman weigh less than 170,
Spence weighing 160 and Cross»
man 133. Fowler tips the scales
at 176, Woodward 206, Graves 175,
Sawyer 19s and Klein 175.

Opposition strong.

The above 11 players were kept
on the same lineup during most of
the scrimmage. Several of the re-
ci-uits who made up the opposition
matched strength and ability evellr
1y with these men. piling up plays
and proving loo stubborn at times
for three or four offensive block-
ers. Among these line recruits are
whittrock, rugged 193 pound tac-
kle, Moore, also a tackle who
weighs 180, High, 175 pound fresh.
man guard. Evans, 180 pound tac-
kle. and Jack Osborn, 178 pound
muscleman from Omaha who miss-
ed getting a letter last fall because
of an injured shoulder.

Livermore, Elliot, Robinson, Rob-
ertson and Fort were other backs
whose performance deserves recog-
nition. Fort is the only heavy
man in this group, as other four-
ranging between 150 and 170
pounds,

.loe Woodward Injured.

Joe Woodward, ti ft., 5 in, 195
pound end incurred a serious leg
injury last week during practice,
He broke a blood vessel in the
side of his right leg between the
knee and hip, the injury causing
an internal hemmor-age which

 

turned the leg black and blue. He
is a transfer from Colgate univer-
sity.

No practice was held Friday or
today due to the fact that Coach
Lookahsugli was in Des Moines,
“Next week we will begin some
hard workouts." the coach was
overheard saying Thursday after-
noon during the practice hour,
