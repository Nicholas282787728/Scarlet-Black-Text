WEAR YOUR PREP CAPS

Thc.Collllcil of House Presidents agreed to
cooperate fully with the Honor G club last
Thursday evening ill the matter of enforcing
freshmanlduties. Plans have been drawn up
and will be placed in effect fit house meetings
Monday night. , _
' However, that does not dispose of the mat»
ter, and the real question now is what atti—

tilde will the present members of the fresh—,

lnfln class take“.7 The wearing of prep caps
has long been a traditional affair here at
Grinllcll. In its early days the tradition was
enforced by liberal use of the paddle, but this
was abandoned for a, more logical appeal to
the freshmen.

You freshmen are treateo‘ as being the
equals of all upperclassmen, and with the GX‘

ception of a few minor duties, enjoy all the,

privileges that the uppel‘classmen do, Now
is your opportunity to Show whether or not
you appreciate your position. The wearing
of prep caps is being made obligatory upon
the basis of no forceful compulsion, but upon
an appeal to you as men. Now‘s your chance
to show that you are willing to play the game.
Wear your prep cops!

MORE COOPERATION NEEDED!

Just a few short weeks ago, Gl‘llll‘lell had a
new football conch, and only a little more
than two wcelis ago he began the installation
of a new system during spring practice.
Hopes fol a successful football season ap-
peared bright when the large squad of more
than 115 men reported regularly for the first
few days of practice.

Now, however, the number of men report-
ing for practice has begun to dwilldlc until
the practice sessions are beginning to be
handicapped by the lack of men present who
know the positions required for different
plays.

Lookabaugh is faced with enough prob»
lems ill installing an entll' ly new system of
ploy, in not knowing the individual players
nor the teams that his men will have to meet
without being further bothered by men foil—
ing to report regularly or delaying practice
when they do so. Football cannot be learned
ill the easy chair by the radio. As one foot—
ball man said, “You have to get out there
every dfly to really enjoy it."

But the number of men who have been (10—
ing this has been steadily dwindling. Now
is the lime to show your real Spir' , your
willingness to cooperate. It is plain that
everyone should do his best to be at practice

THE GRIN’NELL SCARLET AND BLAG

as regularly as possible, but this can’t be
done by spending the afternoon loafing in the
dorms or elsewhere.

Cooperation is needed. Grillnell has 12
days more of practice before the opening
game of the football season next fall. Five
days of spring drills, and seven workouts be-
fore the first game on Sept. 18, So how
about cooperating a little more?

Other Opinions

POLITICIANS WEST POINT
(Daily Illini)

U. S. Representative Wesley E. Disney has the
right idea about government personnel—men care-
fully trained in the administration of public affairs.

"A politicians West Point.” is the way Mr. Disney
describes the National Academy of Public Affairs
which he hopes to legislate into existence through
House Bill 11,225. Through this means, he hopes to
produce men and women of broad Vision and fine
technical training “for the purposes of aiding in the
great forward movements that have overtaken the
World."

"It is only just. it is economic good sense, to have
our government administered by a group whose effi-
ciency can match the skill of our army and navy
officers,” he says.

The bill, in brief, provides:

1. , Establishment of the academy in the District
‘of Columbia.

2. Granting to its graduates preference right to
appointments in civil affairs, with all retiring rights.

3, Creation of a board of supervisors to consist
of the secretaries of state, treasury, interior, com-
merce,‘ agriculture, and labor departments.

4. Authority for the board to “provide a site,
appoint officers, a faculty, teachers, and members,
fix the duties and compensation thereof, and do all
the other things necessary to establish and maintain
the institution.”

5. Free maintenance, livingand tuition for the
students; age limits of 17 to 25 years.

a. Apportionment of appointments among repre-
sentatives (one a year from each congressional dis—
trict), senators (two a year from each for his state),
and the president, (so a year at large from the Dis-
trict of Columbia and Pucrto Rico).

7. Authorization of an appropriation of $10,000,-
000 to launch the academy.

Whatever the merits of this particular proposal,
the growing realization that definite training should
be necessary for public affairs administration is sig
nificant. It is a fact which has been stressed by the
University of Illinois.

POWER OF THE FAIRER SEX INCREASES

(Los Angcles Junior Collegian)

America is headed for matriarchyl During the
past 10 years, women have been quietly waiting for
the time when they can put their fingers in the
“Presidential Pie."

Women today already control three-fourths of the
nation's wealth and one-fourth of its jobs. Also
there are as many mllllonairesses as millionaires,
for Women are beneficiaries of 80 per Cent of life
insurance policies and 65 per cent of all savings ac-
counts are in women‘s names, 50 per cent of all
stocks are owned by women.

Women do not necessarily pass their wealth on to
men, as as per cent of them leave their estates to
the some sex. i

American college graduates average 3,554 women
to 1,943 men each year.

Some sszooooouooo of 592,ooo,ooo,ooo earned she
‘nually in this country are spent by women, and, in
California, the net income earned by women is
$660,592,103.

Gone are thé days when the fairer sex stayed at
home and kept house and were feminine. Today,
women are competing in every form of man's busi-
ness and at times even excel the men.

was only natural that they should like to know for
what reason."
