for Scientific

Study in Child Development

By Gordon McCarty.

“There is a need for a scientific
method of reconstruction in our
complex world,” said Dr. 0. C,
Irwm, professor of psychology at
the State Umvci-sity of Iowa, in
his second lecture last night in
the .Alumiii Recitation hall (1“le
torium.

This should logically start with
scientific investigation in thc
child development field Data
must be collected, Irwin said, to
make curves which will form a
“frame of reference which gives
moaning to cliilrl development."
Family Curves.

Also, the data must be put in
“family" or group curves to at-
ford a check at one child against
another so that curves for normal
development can no prepared,

The “family" of curves must be

 

made out carefully, accurately,
and very thoroughly to ward
against overlooking the deviations
of different children from (llflei'~
ent reactions.

Pictures.

In his first lecture in tlie arter-
noon, Di. Ir ' illustrated his
talk with motion pictures taken
by hnnsclt. The motion pictures
depictcd tlic dcvclopinent in in-
fairts tiom the crude beginning at
one day into full development at
nine to 12 months,

The pictures wcrc shown in

Bulldog Team

Peisner Shifted to
Guard and Center;
Nash at Forward

By Clark A. Smllli.

Friday night finds “the" home
game of the season on tap for
Gn'l'lneu cake: fans as the Pioneers
face an aggressive Drake five,

Coach Bill Williams‘ Bulldogs
will have blood in their eyes, as
they have yet to annex their ﬁrst
conference victory of the season.

For Gl‘inneu, it marks the be-
ginning of a series of crucial tests
on the home floor. To date, thz
Pioneers have shown that they‘
law. potentially a championship
can club.

After the Bulldogs, come the
Aggies and the two invaders from
St. Louis, Washington linivel‘stty
and St. Louis university.

Scrappy Outfit.

”ht: Drake game Will be the
tip-off on the championship
Cl’lSHLGS of Coach Tl‘uesdale’s men.
With the Bulldogs presenting a
scrappy. colorful outfit, the Pin—
nnem Will have to be in thEii' best
form to Win.

Baskttball Contests betWESii the
tw-J lilStlt'tLtlonS are notorious for
tlieii poor brand of ball. The Fl»
valry IS SO intense and bitter that
the contests often lose all semb-
lance of high class court play.
Fouling is frequent and floor play
is Wild and disorganized.

Change in Positions.

Naturally, ll. Will be the main
ubjective of Capt. Bob Berry and
his teammates to keep the game

‘undcr control at all times. It's a

matter of keeping their poise and
making the Bulldogs do anything
but what Coach Bill Williams
wants them to do.

Truesdale will make some
changes in positions. Jim Nash
Will confine his work for the rest
of the season to a forward posi-
tion and will not be used as a
guard. This means that Gene
Peisner will alternate at guard
and center and not at forward.
