captain of the Reds, and Dick which
of the Blacks.

the two ground gainers for the Red
team. Rose's battering rain tactics
gained yardage both thrii the line and
around the ends, while James eluded
tackleis in a mystifying manner.

Like all teams at the beginning of
a season. both aggregations worked

THESE spring breezs make

one fairly long to go on
picnics. But such jaunts call
for food. Or perhaps while
trying the new sport of hi-
cycling you get hungry. The
thing to satisfy for both oc-
casions is fruit. Delicious red

grape fruit or oranges are
the thing to buy. As always
you can get your wants at
