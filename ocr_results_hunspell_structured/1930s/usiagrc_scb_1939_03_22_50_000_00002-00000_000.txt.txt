GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Grinnell which is peculiar to it alone?

Here is an opportunity for modern Grill-
nell men alid women to express their ideas
iii concrete form. That is exactly what the
Fellowship is after.

They want our
”Greater Grinnell.”

It is up to us, whether we interpret it as
a democratic attitude or a richness of reli-
gious heritage, whether we explain it as a
social consciousness, a faith in future possi—
bilities, or a year ing for progress. They
don’t wallt us to limit the Spiri they want
us to put the fuel of it into wolds or into a

it takes us into the field of imagination, and
that is apparently what the

A COLUMN OF PURE
BEAUTY

By John Mal-ion —‘

Fi\e man in Smith bosonicnt who
know nothing about beauty, pul—
chritudncss, etc, last week in a
noisy session picked the five most
desirable. delectable, and delight-
ful girls in Grinnell. The five in
order are Gee, Hyde, Johnson,
Osgood, and Borg. We do not her
little or commend these selections,
we've merely come to the point
Where we'll print anything. The
five least desirable were also pick»
ed, but we're withholding their
names for obvious reasons.

To Chuck Edwards, who ain't been
told yet, we dorf our new spring
fedora. Because he happens to live
in Clark, he is assuming full

crcdit, along with those to whom,_

credit is due, for the late lam<
merited B. a B. But every hall
has one or two of 'em, and we
know Chuck is so THRILLED at
Seeing his name in Doric hc won’t
hate us. All year he’s
BEGGING us to mention him and
now our dllty's did,
as living proof that Barnum was
right!

The alleged dinner last night was
the all-time low in the memory
of this kid. Bad corned beef,
Smelly cabbage, and burned cake
smacks strongly of the collcgiate
alliance with the downtown eating
establishments. (This also goes
for yesterday's breaktast sausage!)
