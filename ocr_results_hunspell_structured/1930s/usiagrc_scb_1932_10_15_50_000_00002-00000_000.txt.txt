eated regard political leadership and interest as be-
neath their dignity.

We do not intend that current affairs on the campus
should be neglected, for die affairs on the campus are
of primary importance to us and we shall continue to
be interested in them. But our point is that to exhibit
any breadth at all we should consider what is going
on in the world at large and not consider the college
campus as the Center of everything in which our ill-
tercst should be manifest.

SIGMA DELTA CHI

Grinncll college chapter of Sigma Delta Chi.
men’s honorary journalistic fraternity, is to be
Commended for Its i'ci'll Gliunell Spirit in approp-
riating $100 of its clldptcl-‘s funds to establish a
Scholarship for a deserving student of Journalism.
As this scholarship is only for freshmen or trans.
fel's it will help to bring to Grillllell a worthwhile
student.

According to the motion passed at the meet-
ing Wednesday night the scholarship is only ill
force for one year, beginning next fall. This was
done in order not to put all undue financial burden
on future members of Sigma Delta Chi if it should
happen that the chapter's treasury was unable to
bear the expense.

However if was incorporated into the by laws
that this new scholarship was to be continued each
year, possible. Let us sincerely hope that future
members of Sigma Delta Chi will filld it possible
to carry out this scholarship for‘which 1hc present
chapter is to be thanked and praised.

A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE

Educators are l-e'marhillg the change of atti'
tude among students this full. During the past few
years, while study and serious thought underlay
the surface of college life, the primary idea was
one of pleﬂsure and enjoyment.

Now more and more students fire here, with the
serious intent of fitting themselves for thclr chosen
positions in life. Some are here who might better
have afforded to come last year, or the year before,
but who have come to l'czllizc, through this period
of economic distress, the importance of a college
education «

This serious intent can, of course, go too far.
Students should have a good time while they a 'c
in school. Their college years will, in all probabil-
ity, he the happiest ones of their lives. A college
with no outside activities would indeed he a sorry
institution, The ideal Student body, every ,memhcl‘
a conscientious student and every one taking time
from his studies to enjoy himself, will probablv
never be nitniucd. but the changed attitude illl.
full is a definite Step in that direction.

CONSIDER THE WORLD
(Beloh. Roundhabie)

We hear many times that college students are
narrow and warped, interested only in the petty things
going on on their own campus, and perhaps the critics
are right, students are so warped in the smug com-
placency of their own lives that affairs of the outside
world seldom seep through the barrier into college
conversation.

Editorials in college papers follow the same trend,
but we are tired of griping about vespers, faculty rulr
ings, and such. We do not pretend to be an authority
on affairs of the world but it sometimes seems that
this attention of students might better be directed to-
ward more important things than panning their school.

It is our contention that college should prepare
students for life, and should not be a four year period,
definitely Segregated from the life that follows. If We
learn nothing more than to conjugate French verbs,
derive and apply mathematical formulas, and recite
long lists of the hibernating habits of various animals,
WE do not believe that college will have fulfilled its
purpose. Higher education is important only as it makes
its graduates better to solve the problems of civilization.

To be sure definite learning is a very necessary
part of a college curriculum and we are not objecting
to it as such, but we think that an effort to tie it up
with practical living would make it infinitely mom
valuable.

We hear so often that the leaders of tomorrow
come from the college generation of today that we are
inclined to pass it up as "old stuff." Yet if we stop to
think seriously We cannot but realize that it is true.
For, if the leaders do not come from the higher institu-

enjoyed the one must be drunk scalding hot and the
other swallowed whole, two factors that aid tremendous
ly in sending spirits to the below zero level.

The morning paper cannot be read in comfort. Pop-
eye and his cohorts must be passed by, and unimportant
things like thc latest war or presidential election must
be road, because they are printed on the front page,
And how can a harassed student, with wild eyes on
the clock, take the time to read beyond that?

The old Ford must be hustled out of the garage in
a manner totally unbecoming such a dignified old amal-
gamation of tin. The gas guage will, of course, register
nearly empty, and the student very frequently punctu-
ates liis desperate ride to campus by a long, brisk walk
in the bracing morning air, in search of that Valhalla
of the motoristia-gasoline station.

But the worst part of allithe bane of every stu-
dent's existence, barring sueh trivialities as punctures,
empty gas tanks, worn down batteries and the likci
greater than all these are the traffic signals and boule-
vard stops, Every one of the former are certain to
tum red at the exact moment the student begins to
smile confidentially to himself in anticipation of catch
ing the light, and the latter are so arranged that it is
impossible to ride along in one smooth stretch for more
than three blocks at a time. '

Is it any wonder that students arrive radiating bliss
and good cheer at their eight o’clocks, and are projected
to the fartherest heights of happiness when the pro-
fessor announces an unexpected little quiz that lie is
sure will start off the day in just the most delightful
manner possible?

CAMPUS AND POLITICS
(Daily Northwestern)

Socialists are the only politically conscious students
on campus. They seem to be the only ones of a vast
student population who are interested enough in their
own and their country’s welfare to do something about
it. Colleges are becoming known as hotbeds for Social~
ism and Communism. There are plenty of loyal conserv-
atives left on campus but they sit idly by and leave
politics to their parents and the political bosses. The
college radicals are the only ones who are not afraid
to blow their own horns and let the world know what
issues they support.

With the presidential election only a month» and a
half away, every student on campus should know the
issues at stake and the platforms of both parties or
at least that of his own preference; and yet out of three
students quetsioned only one could name more than
two planks of either platform.

students, being the cream of the nation’s intellec-
tual crop, should be tearing their hair over political
issues, Instead, their most important topic of discuss-
ion is their last date or the next one.

Every student who feels that his future well-being
is of any importance should understand the current
political issues and should be supporting those that
are worthwhile. Those who get into politics know the
great attraction it has for its participants. Phrased
pendantically, there is no more thrilling adventure in
present day life than to enter into the political jumble.

Students can lobby at conventions, talk to friends,
write their congressmen, and influence their parents to
vote in favor of worthy projects. Make the Union Grill
a meeting place to discuss political questions of the day
after the manner of the English campus coffee shops. The
least that can he done is for all students to take an
interest in campus politics; they at least serve as a
kindergarten to the politics of the nation.

THE STUDENTS RESPONSIBILITY
(Providence Journal)

President Angeli, in welcoming the new freshman
class into the household of Yale, reminded them that
the university, by receiving them, had in some degree
confided her good nam‘e to their keeping. Youthful hu-
man nature being what it is, such a caution is never
untimely, and friends of Yale and of college education
everywhere will wish that Dr. Angelrs words may bear
abundant fruit.

The public, exasperated by some college prank,
rnnde conspicuous by the fact it is associated with a
college, sometimes jumps to the conclusion that the
college has no restraining effect upon its students, or
even that it has a bad influence. As against this attitude
must be set the other so often taken when a student
is expelled for misbehavior, that the college was too
severe, and should have given “the boy" another chance.
In general it is safe to say that the college leans dc-
Cidedly to mercy's side, and in cases of discipline is apt
to think more of the boy’s future than of its own repu-
tation.

That reputation, so injured, may involve more than
hard words. It may cost the college support, and this
when the college is straining every nerve to win friends
and aid for the benefit of the very students who show
so little sense of their own responsibility. College educa-
tion is a partnership, in entering into which the student
is admitted to a great privilege. If a member of the
faculty commits some misdemeanor, the reproach falls
upon himself alone, He is adjudged by society to have
proved himself unworthy of his position. But, if a stu-
dent indulges in some escape/3e, it is the college that
suffers most.

President Angeli did well to bring this fact forcibly
to the minds of the Yale class of 1936, He was not
talking about badness so much as thoughtlessness. Those
boys are destined to become thoughtful in time, Lim
will see to that. But so for, at least, as their acts may
affect the good name of Yale, let us hope that they will
be thoughtful from the start.

Editor, The Scarlet and Black,
Grinuell, Ia.
Dear Sir:

It seems that the time has arrived
for an outspoken opinion of the Arm
crican student body against such out-
rageous acts as the recent rulings of
the Secretary of Labor, Mr. Dock,
against foreign students. These ruh
ings prevent foreign students from
working their way through any Ame
erican college or university on pain
of deportation (work for room and
board is expected under certain con-
ditions). The illegality of these rul-
ings is being tried by the American
Civil Liberties Union. Unqualified
protest of such educators as Presi-
dent Nicholas Miirray Butler of Col-
uinbia university has been evoked.
That these. rulings are certainly rc—
aetionary and unfair is evident to
every American devotee of good
sportsmanship and courtesy.

It is pretended that these measures
are a means toward unemployment
relief. If such is the most comprer
hensivc plan for curing uncmyloyr
meat that the Labor department has
to offer, surely there are more com-
petent hands for leadership of that
department May I quote a few
words from an open letter of the In-
tercollegiate student Council of the
League For Industrial Democracy to
the Secretary of Labor: ”We regard
these rulings as a dangerous tenden-
cy toward intolerant nationalism. We
consider a policy of discrimination
on the grounds of nationality vicious
and inappropriate to a civilized
democracy, We suggest that the
American student concur in these
judgments."

Petitions will be circulated for
your protest. A similar protest from
those of the faculty who resent these
rulings would be welcomed.

Respectfully yours,

. CHARLES E. BURES

Thursday

Dean Luella Read spoke about Oli»
ver Wendell Holmes, ex-associdte jus»
tice of the Supreme court in her
chapel talk Thursday. She emphasized
his liberal qualities, his love of the
truth, his setting new precedents. in
the field of justice, and his key to
happiness, He considered law, not as
a body of fixed formulas, but he
called it always relative, always ap-
proaching but never reaching consis
tency. He believed in liberal interr
pretatlon of the constitution and so
doing he “faced the loneliness of
original work."

Friday
In his chapel talk Friday, Profs?
