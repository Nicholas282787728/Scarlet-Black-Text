New material, ,injected into an all-

: veteran cage team of last year, pro-

duced new life and demonstrated that
no positions are cinched on Coach
John C. Truesda‘le’s Grinnell basket
ball outfit which is drilling this week
on a more polished offensive passing
attack for the Iowa State college
game at Ames Saturday evening.

Harve Oliphant, Julius Bauer and
Harry DuMont were the new men
who showed up well against the Tu»
tors last Saturday, Ollphant was
substituted several times for Mason
or Frye at the forward posts and
gave a good account of himself. Ac—
cording to Truesdalc, there is a pos-
' ’lity that the Indiana sophomore
may get the call at the center posi-
tion this Saturday in order to place
a reliable scoring man in the pivot
post.

Outjunlps Opponent

Bauer demonstrated that he could
outjump the Tutor center on several
occasions and played a starring game
under the bankboal'ds, retrieving the
ball and dribbling away from oppo-
sition, wbilc DuMont, at guard,
showed steadiness in passing and ac-
curacy in both long and short shots.

Bob Morgan, 6 feet 41/. inch center
candidate, will be ineligible this
week, but no other men should be
out’ of the llncup,

“pepper" practice against the fresh—
men yesterday, working strenuously
on their passingwith special empha-
sis on teamwork and timing. Prac-
tiCally the entire session was con-
centl'ated upon this offensive pass»
ing, with no attempt at basket shoot-
ing or defensive work.

Full Squad

It is probable that Coach Trues<
dale will attempt to take his full
squad to Ames Saturday. Besides
DuMont. Bauer, and Oliphant, and
the five lettermen. Santi, Manns,
Phelps, Mason, and Frye, it is pos-
sible that Eugene Klepfcr, forward;
Paul McCully, center, and Jim Brad-
ley, guard, will see action.

Mason and Frye, veteran forwards,
showed ﬂashes of their old—time
hoop-hitting abilities Saturday, and
with general team improvement
