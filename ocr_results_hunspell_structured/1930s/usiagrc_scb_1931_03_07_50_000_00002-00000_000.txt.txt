BAD QUADRANGLE MANNERS

Fami‘ ' is once urorc breeding. not con—
tempt. but caielcssnc. . One of tho lovclicst build-
ings on the Grillllcll college campus, the quadrangle
dining room, is fast becoming the scene of bad
manners.

Evciy any omc of the women killer in after
the ﬁlial bcll, hurry through the meal, and either
ask to be excused early or by all impatient nttir
tilde make others zlt their table uncomfortable.
And all too often the conversation turns to peren-
llilll criticism of the food.

As is oftcn true ill such cases, a little carc ill
small things would make a big difference. If every-
one were on time at me and willing, at least at
dinner time, to spend time enough to cat at it
reasonable speed, the dining room would be more
nearly the gracious place that the facility rind dine
ing room staff are doing their best to make it.

Aside, from the fact that the food is really not
so had, conversation as all art can best be practiced
on other topics than food. The present system of
table assignments offers an excellent, opportunity
for women ill diffcrent groups to compare opin-
ions, and table talk at the quad can he. made inter
esting and stimulating.

This is not a novel idea, but merely zl reminder
that if all the woman were awake to the possibil-
ities of their dining room, as some of them are,
it could be made into one of the vital and inspira-
tional places of Grinncll.

ON THE WAY TO PEACE

The rccent diplomatic victory, achieved when
France and Italy reached agreement on their naval
dispute and signed the London treaty, has dis-
proven to some extent the mconirtglc.
of agitators who have been forever seeing war
clouds on the horizon. True, the basis of the accord
involvcs modiﬁcations of the treaty, but thesc are
slight, and it is safe lo assume that it will only be
a short time until further strides toward perpetuat-
ing international peace will be made.

The signing of the treaty also served to picture
Mussolini in a new light, and it s evident proof that
he certainly has no ambitious war plans for the
next. ﬁve years Numerous observers have contend
ed that the Italian dictator’s policy of extolling
the beneﬁts of war ships and cannon ill one speech
and everlasting peace ill another. was an attempt
to make his plans for war. It is on additional honor
for the English diplomats to have shown that his
speeches were not merely a guise of pscndorpeocc.

After all, there really was 2 bone of contention
in thc Francoltalian naval racc. Each nation wont-
ed to protect its Mcditcrrancoll coast liuc, mid
that brought ill England, a nation which must
llavc sufﬁcient naval arms to keep its trade routes
open. This reverted back to France again, that
nation dcs‘ -illg protection of its Atlantic and Eng

was merely an unfortunate ituation which rcsultcd

ABOLISH STUDENT REFEREES

The next all-college , cmbly will have intra-
mural and var ty athletic as the topic of discus
sioll. Talks will revolve around the place of each
on the campus, and the relations between the two.

Upon the campus of a college the size of Grill-
hell. the greatest interest is boulld to center upon
the intramural sports more than upon the varsity,
because luck of material rarely gives vol ity teams
that are consistent winners, and a lo ng tottm
docs not sustain interest. Athletics today are looked
upon by the spectator as an entertainment more
than as something in which he hiIS o vital int rc t.

BUSINESS DEPRESSION
(From the Womena, Kai-n, Times)

Business depressions originate in the head.

They exist only when and where hope is dead.

If we were optimistic enough to keep hope alive,

Time would change and business would thrive.

If We’re inclined to he pessimistic and drnll,

We'll never see the doughnut, but only the hole.

This great nation should never be depressed.
We must never be pessimistic like the rest.

We are the greatest people in all the earth,

A. hundred twenty millions with wealth and Worth.
All about us many golden opportunities lie,
Opportunities for success to all who will try.

We have half the gold of the world. and more,
No nation has ever had such wealth hefore.
Then why do we make such an awful fuss,
When to use our gold, for relief, is up to us?
When men allow fear to rule their will,

The wheels of progress stopiihey stand still.

If every one, small or great, will do his part,

The wheels of progress will quickly start;

Unemployment will he a thing of the past,

And prosperity will cinne again quick and fast.

Whether it remains for years or only a day,

Will depend on how we act, or what we say.

STAMPING OUT ATHEISM
(From the Oberlin Review)

An interesting melodrama took place last week at
the University of Toronto.

It was a hit ironic that the varsity, daily news-
paper of the university, should he suppressed for voic»
ing a frank editorial opinion, after having fought val-
iantly for some months past, and with the approval of
a large majority of the students and faculty, a splendid
right for free speech in the city of Toronto.

As Professor Geiser has aptly pointed out, there
are times at which oppression results in the advance-
ment of the oppressed cause. He cited as an example
the refusal of Wooster college to anow Norman Thomas
to present the cause of socialism in any college assembly
hall. The case in Toronto is apparently similar.

The nest treatment for any belief is to allow it
free puhl' ity. If it is sound, it will stand; if unsound,
it will readily he attacked. It is better to allow the
arguments for the tariff and against chain stores public-
ity than to suppress them. The first economist who
comes along can easily demonstrate that they are un—
sound.

Precisely this happened at Toronto. Immediately
following the editorial on atheism, the theists attacked
from all sides. The Varsity met the issue squarely, and
printed the objections on its front page.

Right or wrong in editorial opinion,
deserves complete vindication.
