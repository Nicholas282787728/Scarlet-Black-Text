State Meet
Ends Regular
Track Slate

Thomas, Murphy, Gerhardt
Golz Run Last Times

for Grinnell

Four members of the Pioneer track
team will be seen in action for the
last time in regularly scheduled come
petition at the thirty-sixth annual
state meet to be held at Iowa City,
Saturday. They are Co—captains Dick
Murphy and Hank Thomas, Otto Golz,
and Wyman Gerhardt.

Coach Lester Duke will take prac-
tically the same squad that made the
trip to the conference meet in Omaha
last week. This will be the last meet
of the year for most of the team, ale
though a few men may be taken to
the National Interscholastic meet at
Chicago early in June.

Pioneer hopes for a first place in
the state meet are slim, considering
the allsround balance of the Univer»
sity of Iowa team and the recent per»
formance of the Drake outfit at the
Valley meet. The Hawkeyes have ‘won
the meet now eight times in success
sion, and will be bidding for their
ninth triumph.

Capt. George Shling of Iowa is a
topheavy favorite to take both hurdle
races while the rest of the Hawkeye
squad is balanced enough to take the
necessary seconds and thirds to come
through to victory. Earl Labsrtew
and Lyle Chapman arc the best bets
from Iowa state, while Drake will
have a number of men in the running,

Crinncll's chances lie in the hands
of the Myron Pilbrow, twosmiler; Cos
captains Thomas and Murphy in the
440; Alexander in the sprints; W.
Grounds in the hurdle races, James
in the broad jump; Grailund in the
javelin throw; Pfcifcr in the mile, and
Rose in the shotput.
