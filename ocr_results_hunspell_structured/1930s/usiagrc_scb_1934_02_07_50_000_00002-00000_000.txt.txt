VICTORY DAY ‘

Just because Grinuell defeated Butler ill a bus—
ketball game here last night is no reason to e. lcl'l
the traditional “new era” ill athletics with which
so many sports writers greet an upset, It. does.
however, show the steady development of a team
which has great possibilities, and it marks tllc first
major victory on the Grinnell campus since last
spring.

*Such an event is worth the declaration oi? a
“vietol day,” for the increase in student morale
ng. Tile victory does not leave much '
for crowing, however, for Friday the Pioneers will
lueet Drake, a traditional foe, ill a game whose out-
come year after year has eluded the attempts of the
forecasters, because of the intense spirit of rivalry
among the players.

INCREASED FACILITIES.

It has been suggested by a member of college
athletic board that one or two handball courts
might be constructed in the north end of the old
heating plant. In face of the growing popularity
of handball among the men on the campus and the
limited gvmnasium facilities, the proposal seems fl
sound one_

The handball court now ill use ill the men’s
gymnasium is admittedly a makeshift affair, and
even it is available only during limited periods
when the bleachers are not up and the va sity
basketball squad is not practicing. Two regulation
size courts could be constructed in the heating
plant at a very nominal cost. As strenuous as the
game is, players could use the courts on all but
bitterly cold days without it being necessary to
heat the room. Three or four times the number of
men now playing the game could enjoy the illicl'r
esting sport with the increased facilities

With the increased participation which would
undoubtedly result if these new courts should be
built, handball could very reasonably be added to
the field of intramural athletics. Individual come
petition would thus he made available to a. large
group of men, many of whom likely would not be
engaging in any intramural activities otherwise.

Handball would be an especially practical
addition to the men’s sports program in that
participation in this pastime may be conveniently
and beneficially continued after graduation. The
feasibility of the proposal should certainly bear
investigation.

Of course a year has p d since these figures
were first given by the Navy Department, hilt the
wide difference between American and Japanese
strength at that time makes utterly absurd the
statement that Japan could even consider all at»
tack upon the United States for many decades.
Surely we are not afraid of English aggro ion?
The only possible danger of that would arise from
a fear alld haired wllich does not exist and will not
exist unless we frighten each other by a uni ‘dl race.
Our preparation must not be against uoighllol in
nations, hilt against war itself. The real danger 0
war directly involving America is not the danger
of foreign attack; it is the danger of naval rivalry
which recent legislation, if enacted. will help to
bring about.

“THE WHOLE TRUTH"
(The Reveille, Le. State College)

Most of us swear that we speak the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, and 'we contend that
we want this very thing in everything wc do and every»
thing we read. Yet our life is one long epic of indus~
triously fostering illusions.

if we desired “Truth in Behavior." we should rule
out “I'm pleased to meet you" at once. Sincerity is the
keynote. Exclaim, “I loathe the sight of you and I
hope you choke."

if we really wanted the truth behind the news, the
bare unsdarned facts. dull characters would not be
dramatized or sordid details glamol-ized. A Midnight
Moll would become the drab prostitute, and the Thrill
BanditA—a. young girl or boy who packed a. gun. A
Torch Fiend~a tried old man, befuddled with dope, who
murdered his bigamous second wife and burned her
body to hide the evidence. Beautiful Mrs. Slats would
really be e pinched, shapeless. toothless, ‘homely woman
of 45. The Scarlet Woman would fade into a drab little
taxi-dancer of moron mentality.

“Truth in Advertising" has never been realized
fully. A correspondence course might advertise:
“You'll Never Amount to Much!
one men in a thousand. Millions Study and slave, but
they never get anywhere."

No, truth all the time would never do. Who wants
it thus anyway? It would pe a menace. We must
have our gioin'ous illusions for they are an integral part
