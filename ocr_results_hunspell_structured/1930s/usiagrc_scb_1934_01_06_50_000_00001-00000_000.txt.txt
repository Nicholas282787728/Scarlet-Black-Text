know how the mistake had oc-
curred. nor whether the game had
originally been scheduled for Fri-
day or Saturday. The. Grinncll

carried the date Saturday, Jan. 6.
for the game.

urday date, but, according to re-
ports from St. Louis. the St. Lou-
is newspapers and Washington
university officials had announced
the date as Friday.

checks for the game tonight.

lymphatic infection as the result of
a skinned knee received in the Cent

tral game, and has not yet been able
to return to Grinnell. Bob ‘Morgan
