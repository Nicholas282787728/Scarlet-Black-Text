Grinnell Takes Secon

 

Few Positions
for Graduates

Says Wehrhan

Firms Discontinue Policy

of Sending Agents;
Close Schools

”Old man depression” is going to
'hit the class of 1932 hard if present
indications hold true. Nelson w.
Wehrhan, director of personnel here.
said in an interview today. Chief
among these indications are the facts
that business concerns are not sends
log out field agents to intewiew stu-
dents and that many concerns are
cutting out their training schools.

l-leretofore, agents for the larger
business concer‘ns as General Electric
and Westinghouse made the circuit
of colleges and universities spending
a day or so at each talking to senior
students, and agents for summer
camps and selling houses have also
visited the campuses According to
their general offices, such business
will be done entirely by mail this
year. The only agent known to be
coming to Grinnell this spring will
be representing the Stanley Hotels
Co.

Indicates Lack of Positions

The Young Women‘s Christian 215-
sociation which has never.failcd to
send a representative on a circuit of
the colleges has abandoned the plan
this year. The closing of training
schools for college graduates as
previously maintained by large con-
cems i directly indicatory of lack
of pos ions to be filledr by college
graduates, There are too many train-
ed men already out of work ‘to wall»
rant training men who could not pos»
sibly be placed at the present time,
Wehrhan believes.

‘ “While February is early, even in
the best of times for college seniors
to be lining up positions for June,”
Mr. Wehrhon said, “there are no
Grinnell seniors who have definite
hopes of a position at this time
through the efforts of this bureau.

Early For Teachers

As Mr. Wehrhan pointed out. it is
too early for teaching positions to
be open, the usual time for school
elections being about the middle of
March, after which vacancies will be
known. The Grinnell personnel bureau
has already sent out 400 application
blanks to be filled in by school sup-
erintendents and principals as to their
needs and requirements. The end of
March will see teaching posts begin-
ning to be filled.

Mr. Wehrhan has already made one
trip to Chicago to talk with personnel
heads and placement managers about
indications for the present year, and
will make another trip just before
spring vacation.

Meet Managers

This future trip will be made to
line up appointments for seniors to
meet these managers during their
spring vacation. This system was in-
augurated several years ago and both

Sunday Sermons

With Journalism

Minister of the gospel, and aspiring
journalist is Paul Hammar, Colfax,
pastor of the Baptist church in that
community, and enrolled this comes-
ter as a sophomore in Grinnell cola
lege.

During the week, Mr. Hammar
makcs his home in Grinnell, but
spends his weekends with his wife
and family in Colfax. He formerly
attended Drake university at Des
Moines and Macalaster college in St,
Paul.

Prospects of being a weekday
journalist and a Sunday minister
await Mr. Hammar after he comr
pletcs his journalistic course here, At
present he has a small job press with
him in Grinnell. with which he is
supplementing his ministerial earn-
ings.

“Wilt thou come and tread a meas
ure?" George asks, bowing low before
Martha and she, putting on her best
coy manner, blushes behind her fan
and accepts. But she may give her-
sclf away when she giggles as she
stumbles over her unaccustomed long
full-hooped skirt.

Tonight is the one evening of the
year when Grinnell women drop their
roles as coeds, assume the quaint
manners and costumes of 150 years
ago, and participate in the dances of
their ancestors, the minuet, the Vir-
ginia reel, and the Rye waltz at the
annual Colonial hall. Basque waists,

the afternoon came to a close, coeds
were adding a last puff-full of bath

' TOur Abroad

Women Abandon Proposed
Trip to Europe

Despite tentative plans for a Eur-
opean tour. made several months ago
by the Grinnell college Women's Glee
club, annoucement that the project
has been definitely abandoned was
made today by George L. Pierce, di-
rector of the college glee clubs, and
Marjorie Hocum. president of the
Women's organization.

Because of the-fact that this year
marks the twentyrfifth anniversary
of the founding of the Women's Glee
club, and because of especially low
rates which could have been obtained
for the tour thru England, Norway,
Sweden, Germany and France, it was
thought that the trip might be ar-
ranged this summer.

Lack of finances for the trip be.
tween Grinnell and New York was
given as the major reason for aban»
cloning the tour.

Altho the tour had at no time been
definitely scheduled,
members of the glee club had ob
tained permission of their parents to
make the trip and had planned to
hear part of their own expenses.

Financial aid for the tour was
solicited from alumni and persons in-
terested in Grinnell college “Sub
scription of approximately 31,000
more would have financed the tour,”
said Pierce today.

Several midwesterh college newspa-
pers have expressed themselves in
favor of attempts by The Scarlet andl
Black to secure full interpretation of
‘news in the library. This centers
about editorials favoring rte-admission
of the Chicago Tribune to the library
on the grounds that despite some
news bias it offered students a ser-
vice in presenting views on disarma-
ment and prohibition differing from
lthose included in the papers now

First Half Even
The entire first half of the fray
was fast and well~played with neither

in Frank Smith‘s Shot, Duncan fol-
lowed with a free throw, Ullrich with
a short shot, and Rowe, a gift toss, to
put Grinnell in the lead, 5 to 2.
Both fives were playing excellent
defensive ball but couldn't hit the
hoop consistently. The Bulldogs rule
lied at this point and took the lead,
6 to 5, with Abram and Schultz sink-
ing free throws, and Stringfellow
