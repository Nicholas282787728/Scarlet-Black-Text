Creighton Clear: Title Path

by 41 to 28 Victory
Here Saturday

Although they had the honor of be-
ing the first cagers lto outplay the
Grcighton fivc this season, the Crin-
ncll Pioneers could not cope with the
advantageous height of VVIllazd
Schmidt, Slx—(oot-clglltrinch Elllejay
center, and lost, 41 to 23, Saturday
night.

All of Schmidt’s shots were made
from directly under the basket, a
teammate making an arched pass so
that the lanky ccntcr could hold the
ball out of reach of an opponent.
meanwhile setting himself for the
shot. He tallied seven baskets and a
free throw, which proved to be more
than the margin of victory.

Defense Determined

If it had not been for this style
of play, something new to local fans,
the Pioneers would probably have
won the game. A grim, determined

defense ,kept the Bluejay attack away

from the basket, and it was this same
determination that kept Gl‘lnnell in
the running throughout the game,
The Pioneers usually trailed by a
margin of five points or so, but at
no time did the Creighton team have

s chalice to make it a walkway.

Having completely smothered the
lightning-fast Bluejay attack, Coach
J. C. Truesdale's men staged a scor-
ing orgy of their own. For the first
time this season, the Pioneers were
able to make their long shots good.
Marion Frye, sophomore forward find,
camc through with four long oncs and
a tip-shot under the basket, in addlr
tion to a pair of free throws for
scoring honors on the Grinnell team.
Frank Duncan registered with four
field goals, but othcr members of the
team had little chance to score.

Tire of. Close

With only three minutes to go, the
Pioneers pulled up to within six
points of the Bluejays, «trailing by a
32726 count. At this point, however,
the scarlet and black cagers tired
and Creighton lengthened the gap,

incidentally, has won two games and
lost two for its combined total.

The Rnwson A ouiutct won a gruell-
ing overtime struggle from the Smith
team, 10 to 9, when Fred Bulmahn,
forward, tossed in a free threw for
the margin of victory, after Smith
had madc a desperate second half
spurt to tie the count. Bulmalln's
defensive play was also a factor in
the Rawson triumph.

Smith’s 13 team gained revenge,
howcver, coming from behind after
Rawson apparently had the game on

points, which gives him a total of 23
for individual honors among all build-

Coeds Disregard
Calorie Menace;
Eat Breakfasts

Counting of calories may be a uni-
versal feminine practice, but if the
breakfast attendance figures given
out by Eleanor McFall and George
Van Nostrand, head waiters at quad-
Tangle and dormitory dining rooms,
are any indication, Grinnell coeds do
not subscribe to the rule,

Before the new cafeteria system
was inaugurated, on averhge of 120
women crawled out of bed to pal-take
of their morning orange j ice and
toast, but an average of only 105 to
110 men struggled down to their
Seven o'clock coffecs.

When the breakfasts were served
a la cafeteria style Monday, 60 quad»
itcs who had previously preferred
their 40 winks succumbed to the bait,
and 180 women, against 171 men,
answered the call of the breakfast
bell,

Tuesday tbc men apporcntly lost
interest, for only 161 portook of carly
refreshments, whercos 207 womcn de»
cidcd to enjoy a 1)re~cllapel appetizer.
Possibly the increased attendance at
the quadrangle dining room is due
to the fact that the women who eat
breakfast are no longer allowed to
bring food out of the hall to than
less energetic roommates.

game \Vlllt'll will be pl'lyed lllc

BUOllCl' Bulldogs
have already met the Pionccrs once

this season, dropping the year's open»

er by a 24721 count although the game

did not count on conference standings.

Drake has played only one game for

conference records, that being the

Creighton tilt here last Friday.
Veterans Idle

The Drake mentor is making little
effort to use all of his veterans,
building his five with an cye toward
late season games. His rangy five,
which is the team which will prob-
ably oppose the Pionccrs Saturday, in-
cluded only two lcttermen, those he-
'ug Everett (Germany) Schultz at
center and Don (Goose) King at for-
ward.

King was but a midget compared
with the rest of this outfit, but his
shooting eye gave him a berth.
Leo Goldcn played the other forward
while George Ross and Stanley Se~
bastian worked at guards,

Smith, Meyers Included

Boelter’s “speed" five includes two
men who will be eligible for competi-
tion next semester, Frank Smith at
center, and o. F. (Moose) Myers at
forward. The latter is a brother of
Barney Myers, former crack Drake
bssketman.

Olson is working at the other for
ward berth while the Dave Abram~
Wayne Xander guard combination
completes the “Terrier" aggregation.

Push Pioneers

Three veterans, Bowers, Kokjohn,
and Goodwin are not seeing cage ac-
tion this season. Goodwin is nursing
a bad ankle, injured in football.

Drake has been turning up on the
short and of the score in its games
this season, although it managed to
push Grinncll hard in the first game.
and gave Iowa State college a scare.

Have soaring Power

The Bulldogs havc scoring power
in his forward combination of King
and Goldcn, although it does not tuner
tion consistently. Its possibilities were
shown in the Creighton tilt, however.
when Drake held the lead during the
first part of the game.

King is a brother of Lynn King, co»
captain of the cage team last year,
and captain of the football team.
Golden is a former all-state high
school player with the 1928 state
championship Davenport team. He
was recently married and works at
the Des Moines Health Farm.
