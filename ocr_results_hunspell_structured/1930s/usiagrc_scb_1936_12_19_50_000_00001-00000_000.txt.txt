Lack of Material V

Will Hamper Plans‘

for Mat Team 5

Lack of material of intel'rcollo
giate caliber will hamper G
nell’s attempt to build up a varsir
ty wrestling team this year, ac
cording to Guy Lookabaugh, wres-
tling coach,

As a result of the incomplete
wrestling tournament, Coach Look,
abangh is dubious as to the possi—,
bilities of Grinnell having strong
enough material. He indicated to—
day that he was well satisfied
with the candidates for the 125.
136, and 145-lb. classes, but that
lack of experience would be a se—
l‘iolls handicap in the other divie
sions.

"In one or two years, after we
have had extensive training and
experience, and providing we can
interest more men, particularly
heavyweights, to come out for the
sport, 1 am sure that we will gain
much ground, and the sport will
become much more popular here
at Gi‘iniiell," Coach Lookaballghi
said this morning.

iPioneers Lose
to Coe Again
by Two Points

Grinnellians Drop Game
at Cedar Rapids
36-34

Playing without the regular
services of Carcaptain Jimmy L27
Masncy, Grinnell's Pioneers lost a
lwo~p0lnt decision to the fast pass
ing Coe quintet in a game played
at Cedar Rapids last night. The
final score was 36-34 instead of
3634 as crroncously reported in
the headline of the morning paper.

LaMasney, who was withheld
from the starting lineup by Coach
John c. Truesdale, because of a
weakened condition caused by ill
ness the past week, was not up to
his usual scoring form when i-n
sorted in the lineup. This was a
decisive factor as the Grinnellians
lost their second twoepoint decision
.to the Kohawks within a week.

unfasneyv Out

with Bill Conwill in at LaMase
ney’s foiward position, the Pier
necrs pulled away to an early 7»o
lead, but the Coe team solved the
Grinnell offense and led at half-
time 17-15. Coe jumped into a
31-25 lead midway in the last pe-
riod, but their luck held and the

,last minute scoring efforts of the

Pioneers fell two points short of
a tic This is the fifth straight
win or Coach Forest Rittger‘s
Crimson five.

McKinley were again the scoring
thorns in the side of the Grinneil
defensive machine, Kammer lead-
ing the scoring with 15 points,
while McKinley rang in seven
counters.

Read, James Collages
Win in Semi-Finals
of Volleyball Tourney

James and Read cottages en-
tered the final round of the wom-
en's intramural volleyball tourna-
ment this afternoon by defeating
teams from Haines and Mears
cottages respectively.

James won the right to enter
the finals by chalking up a 44 to
40 victory over the Haines repre-
sentatives, while Read was an easy
victor over the freshman team
from Mears, winning by a large
margin of 5G to 14. ‘

The contest between James and
Haines was a fastrmoving affair
with the final outcome in doubt
until the final minutes. Superior
teamwork on the part of the
James players was one of the ma-
jor factors in the cottage three
victory, Mildred Williams, Haines
player, incurred a twisted ankle in
a collision with a team-mate, but
she was able to resume ,play after
a short rest.

Read and Mears played a slower
game, Mears was handicapped by
the lack of players, having only
six women competing. Read, too,
was short players, being represent—
ed by only eight women.
