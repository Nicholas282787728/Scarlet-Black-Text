INSTITUTIONS
lustitutioll-lnindedness is :l curse when it gets
ill the way of individual happiness. When I'm lllr
stance a Dictator Pilsuds sets the illisollltism oi.
the state above the liberties of individuals of op
pressed races, he is carrying institutionalisnl too
fol:

On the other hand, civilization cannot progress
if we do not thinl: in terms of institutions. Ancient
Greece w in anarchy because Greeks aould think
only ill to .lls of individual interest. Romans on
the other hand thought always of the national ill-
stitutions. They set the power of the state above
individual welfare.

Students need to become Inoro rather than
less institutionally minded. When tenln lllemhcrs
elect captains they lnust think of illevieillll on
il utitution rather than of personal friendships. And
if students are to elect successful student govern-
ment leaders in the coming elections, it is absolute
ly essential that they hury personal feelings. It is
important for the voter to ask himself wllo cull
make the dormitory or the, student body into the
most effective and militant 01 llizaiion.

OUT OF POLITICS
(From the Des Monies Register

After seven years of discussion, the students and
faculty of Grinnell college now appear to be won over
to the idea of instituting a board of student publications.

It is, of course, a tribute to the four student publi—
Cations at Grinnell that they have been able to get along
as well as they have without the more businesslike
methods which a publications board usually represents,
The Grinnell publications have been outstanding in their
various groups and have been singularly free from offi-
cial censorship.

There are many advantages, however, in adopting
a board of student publications such as those which
tlmction at Northwestern university and the Universis
ties of Iowa and Nebraska. A board of this type, with
a student majority but with faculty representation, is
the logical body to elect editors and business managers
of student publications.

Such a board tends to remove such elections from
campus politics. and its responsibility for auditing the
books of the publications may in some cases be a needed
protection to the publications and their subscribers.
There is an added advantage when, as in most cases,
the board imposes an arrangement by which profits are
divided among staff members according to a fixed scalc
instead of ail going into the pockets of the publication
heads.

Grinnell should profit considerably by the adoption
of a publications board. At the Same time, care should
be taken to avoid the slipping in of censorship and to
preserve the freedom of expression which has come to
be one of Grinnell’s most valued traditions.

Filipino Student

Bollilztcio Agilinaltlo, Filipino and

which passed the house of represent»

to give complete independence to the
Philippine Islands within 10 years is
only just.

“I believe we are really for
freedom," he said today.
