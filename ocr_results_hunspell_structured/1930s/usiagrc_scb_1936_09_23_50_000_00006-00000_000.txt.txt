GRINNELL’S LOSS

Grinncll college suffered the loss ol’ one

timclv passing of Charles A. Hanson. form-
cl' United States Senator fr .11 Iowa and a
staunch friend of the college.

There is little that can he said about
this man that has not already been

whom the men’s dormitory, l'ol'mel'l known
as building tlllee, was named,

n familiar sight on the campus. He always
was interested ill the college students, and
more than one Gl'inllellinn has known his
generosity.

A man of high ability, generous to the
utmost, a superb sportsman ol' the best
type, an influence for good ill many ullohr
tl'usive ways, a man who has been loved and
who will be remembered with affection, that
was Charles Ran-son,

He u s the best that Grinnell developed,
and it is with a lieen sense of loss, that
evely Glinnelliau is forced to acknowledge
his passing.

TO GRINNELL STUDENTS

Our oldest and greatest university has
ln' been celebrating- its Tercentena ' Ha
r rd university is 300 years young T'
year Grinnell college, representing the
same pioneering in higher education, is 90
years young. A college cannot grow old.
Its eternal youth is guaranteed by the an-
nual influx of a flood of new and vigorous
Inc. This miracle of rejuvenation is going
on at Grinncll during these days with the
coming of the class of 1940. i am told
that this class promises to ho conspicuous
for quality even more than for size. In any
case, the continuing worth of a college de—
pend upon the quality of the constantly in-
flowing stream of new lile. We are most
happy to welcome the newcomers to our
community, and we wish them happy and
prosperous years here at Gl-innell, We
pledge them all the help that we older l'olli
can give to make their years here 1)]‘OS])C1‘~
oils and happy.

Meanwhile, we also rejoice in the return
01 the largest body of older students the
college has ever welcomed back to its cam-
pus. Yoll, who have already geared yourr
selves into the smooth running of our colr
lege machinery, know what your l‘esponsl-

i es and your privileges are, and we have
full confidence that yoll will live up to these
fully and joyously.

Mrs. Nollén and I are exceedingly sorry
that circumstances make it impossible for
us this year to welcome the new students
find to welcome back the old in the custoll’k
my way. We one, nevertheless, interested
in every phase of the college activities from
football to Vespers, and we shall be follow-
ing the progress of events in the new year
with the keenest interest and sympathy.
We shall be looking forward eagerly to the
day when it will again be ollr privilege to
take our full share in the life of the college
and to greet you all face to facel

We_ have ths year the largest enrollment
in the history of the college It ought to
be the best year in our history. I am sure
that you will all do what in you lies to

make it so. _ \

FRIENDSHIP
(Daily O'Collegion)

Not all success in college can be measured by
a tangible yardstick. The intangible quality of
friendship and the ability to form and keep alive
loyal and lasting friendships are rewards of a col-
lege life that no student can permit to escape him.

College offers an opportunity‘foi the backward
student to make new friends. to understand and
hear other students ideas in regard to certain sub-
Jects, and to learn and have imbued in him the spi t
of “give and take.” Countless proverbs have been
penned with “Nothing worthwhile is acquired easily
and without work” as suhject matter. That - still
holds true in regard to friendship in college or elser
where for that matter. True friends are cultivated—-»
not acquired No one can go forth and choose a
person with loyal trails by saying: “Here. 1 must
have you as my friend." We are not; taught to make
lusting friendships on contracts like that. Real
friendship is a slow process. And to have friendship
a person must first be a friend,

No limlt can be designated as to the amount
of discretion that. should be used in selecting friends.
False friends are loyal and trustworthy as long as
they run he so Without cxpcndlng‘ too much of their
own efforts, and as long as they tlo not have to sac-
rifice something for a f and. Times of adversity
have proven the most oxacting‘ testing ground (or
friendship: All of us cannot be perfect, and it
uoulrl be foolish to expect perfection from any of
our friends. Trivial traits and whims of a friend
that (to not please should be overlooked.
