back to take first in the 440 yard
free style. Another closely contested
event was the 150 ynrd back stroke,
in which Weld of Iowa state man—

Exclusive Designers

Brintnall buyers have just returned from an extra trip to Eastern
style centers, made necessary by the unusually large volume of dress
business the store has been doing the past few weeks.

The result is an almost entirely new showing of late modeled
\ garments that is more comprehensive than any display ever made by
this store.
You can tell at a glance that they are not the usual run of
dresses—and yet they are priced no higher than you are expected to
pay for the usual run.

—College girls are especially invited to come in and try them on.
