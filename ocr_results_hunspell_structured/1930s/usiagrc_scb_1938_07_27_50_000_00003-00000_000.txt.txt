track on Word
field which was partly resur-
faced hot spring, is being cut
down from the original oneethird
of a mile distance to a quarter-
milc oval, After cold weather
and rain halted the resurfacing
operations last year it was de-
cided to wait until this summer
and make complete alterations,

The zzoeyard straightway which
runs past the west stand was My
surfaced during the spring, how-
cven In reducing the distance
around the track, the crew has
cut down both curves at the
north and south ends of the field.
Whereas they originally extended
far beyond the football tield, they
new cut directly behind the goal
posts on both ends.

The east side of the track has
also been moved in so that it now
runs right behind the bleachers.
In planning the size or the track,
Louis V. Phelps, treasurer of the
college, said that when the track
was built there was no standard
size for colleges and the school
built it according to its own spec-
ifications. Now, with all other
colleg having the regillal',q\lal'-

track of a standard size, be said.
