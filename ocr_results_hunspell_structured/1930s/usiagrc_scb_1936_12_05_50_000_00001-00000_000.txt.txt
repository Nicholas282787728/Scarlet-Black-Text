Police Seek

Stolen Lamp
in Dorms

Railroad Switch Light
Disappears Night
of Hell-Week

Police and railroad authorities
today were continuing their inves-
tigation of the disappearance of a
Minneapolis and St, Louis 1 1—
road switching signal lamp, which
was taken by unknown persons on
Nov, 21,

The lamp, which disappeared
the night of Hell week, is believed
to have been taken by some cola
lege student as a prank, accord-
ing to Police Chief Alex Manson,
who, with Joseph Frohnauer, spe-
cial agent for the Minneapolis and
St. Louis railroad, is investigating
the loss. Mr, Frohnauer came to
Crinnell Thursday from Minnea—
polis to take up the matter but
left after making preliminary ine
vestigations,

College Involved

Chief Manson said this morning
in commenting upon the theft.
"Circumstantial evidence points to
the theft having been committed
by college students. The word
Clark and several other indistin—
guishable marks were painted on
the railroad ties, which leads us
to believe that it was a college
prank." ‘1‘]

The Pohce Chief pointed out
that tampering with railroad piop.
erty is a serious offense, being
punishable under both federal and
state laws. “If the lamp is re-
turned, the culprit will not be se-
verely punished this time," Chief
Manson said, ”but we cannot per—
mit such pranks to continue. The
offense is punishable by imprison
ment in the penitentiary, under
the law.

Buckley Cements

John Buckley, president of the
Council of House Pieeidents, de—
clared yesterday afternoon that
everything possible would be done
by the men's governing body to
assist the authorities in securing
the return of the lamp. Investigaa
tions will he made in each dorm -
tory by the respective house pres«
idents.

“This tampering with railroad
property is a serious matter, and
we cannot tolerate it. While it is
not absolutely cetrain that the
prank was committed by college
men, still, circumstantial evidence
points unmistakably in that direc—
tion, and we shall take action to
remove any suspicion that we were
involved, Mr. Buckley said.

Petition
Voted Down

Faculty Refuses Request
for Vacation Change

petitions to adjourn college on
Dec. 15 instead of Dec. 22 were
refused by the faculty at a special
meeting held Thursday afternoon
to consider the request.

“Because the petition requested
a change in the calendar, which
was the product of much consid-
eration, and which had been an-
nounced last March, the faculty
did not think that it should grant
the request,” Henry s. Conard,
dean of the faculty, said yester-
day in announcing the decision.

“The petition was given the
fullest consideration, and the fac-
ulty consider it one of the best
efforts at organization made by
the student government in a long
time," he explained, "but because
of the many changes involved, the
faculty did not feel that it should
be granted."

in discussing the present ar-
rangement, Dr. Conard pointed
out that the current calendar had
been worked on for more than a
month last year, and that a rep-
resentative of the student govern—
ment had sat on one of the faculty
committees which approved the
calendar.

Suggestion of Osculatl'on Strike
Meets Extremely Cold Reception at Grinnell

 

at the University of Utah as a
protection against winter colds
would have a hard time even
getting on the Grinnell campus,
if scattered public opinion is any
indication, Grinnell students want
their kisses, even at the risk of
pneumonia.

“Happiness is more important
than health," as one Read junior
put it, A brunette from the Cy-
clone cellnr declared, “If that no-
sliaving business had kept up, I'd
think it was a pretty good idea.
otherwise, it's rather foolish."

Honor G Is Iminunc

And then there was the Honor
G man who said, "I'm immune to
colds. ‘Tnke codeliver oil and

 

The “osculation strike" started kiss' is my motto."

His girl, a
senior with a flair for the epi-
gram, followed through with
“There's a contradiction between
colds and kissesia kiss isn't
supposed to be cold! Anyway, I
think colds come from Fate, not
kissing."

IL was practically impossible to‘

find anyone who would take up
the strike if it were inaugurated
here, One junior girl did say,
timidly. “It would save a lot of
trouble My idea of fun at a
dance is not a wrestling session
on a park bench.“

Pure Jouriinlist

Of course, there was also the
journalistic junior who declared
with a twinkle in one eye, “Be-

cause of my Welleknuwn purity, 1
don't think I'm authority enough
to make a statement on the sub
ject.”

One couple cautiously admitted
having tried the noble experiment,
but had_to own up that the only
solution they'd found was not
dating for the duration of the
cold.

Getting right down to details in
the inhibitions vs. influenza battle,
we have the suggestion of the
blase junior who asked, “Why
should you catch cold from kiss-
ing if you don't slob'ber?"
Summing up the whole situa-
tion was the answer of the petite
brunette, who said, “The idea is
nuts. Let Nature take its coursel"

 

Luiek, Berry, Snow, High
Receive Conditions
at Mid-Semester

Ineligibility of four basketball
players seriously damaged hopes
for a Pioneer Victory in the first
cage game of the season Monday
night against the Iowa state
Teachers quintet at Cedar Falls.

Four cagers, Wilbur Luiok, Rob-
ert Berry, Harold High, and Eur-
dette Snow, received conditions
this week following the issuance
of mid-semester grades, and are
automatically ineligible for Monv
day night's game, according to
Miss Bethsna McCandless, regis-
trar,

Luick received a. condition in
French, Berry in English, High in
philosophy, and Snow in econom-
ics, Berry has already removed
his condition, but according to col«
lege rules can not play Monday
night because all questions of eli-
gibility must be decided a week
before the game. He will be eli-
gible for the Iowa State game on
Friday night.

The other three cagers, too.
may become eligible for the Ame
es tilt if they make up their
work this week—end, Miss Mc-
Candless said yesterday.

Weak at Center

The loss of Luick and Berry,
who both are more than six feet
in height, seriously injures the
Pioneer strength at the center
position. Luick was the proba-
ble starter, while Berry, although
not a starter, would have seen
considerable service at both the
guard and center post.

Coach John C. Truesdale, when
notified of the latest developer
ments by telegram, at Kansas
City, where he is attending the
yearly meeting of the Mjssouri
Valley conference coaches and
faculty representatives, indicated
that he would probably start Co-
captain James LaMasney at one
forward post, with Fred Luther,
sophomore, at the other, John
Haywar , 'unior, will probably get
the call at center, while the
backcourt positions will he handle
ed by two lettermen, Co-capiain
Hal Dean and Bill Fowler.

The Pioneer mentor also indi-
cated that Robinson, Sampson.
Barker, Woodward, Wallace, Blay-
ney, and Conwill will get a
chance to see action in the Tutor
tilt
