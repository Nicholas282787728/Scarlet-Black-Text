French cinema starring Danielle

Dal'l‘ieux. is coming to Grinnell
Tuesday, direct from New York.

Elbert M. Smitn, faculty advisor
of the French club, sponsors of

from New York asking him to re-
linquish the contract for the Grin-
neil showing of the picture in
order that it might be held over
another week in New York
where it has already had a run
of three months.

Because arrangements had al—
ready been made for the show-
ing here, Smith did not grantthe
request.

Danielle Darrieux, the French
star of “Mademoiselle Mozart,“ is
the newest Hollywood sensation.

“Mademoiselle Mozart" is a nil.
arious comedy of Paris, with
catchy French songs, a capable
and clever supporting cast. and a
freshly amusing plot.

The scoring was distributed even-

Jerry Fort, Gene Peisner, Wilbur
Luick, Capt. Robert Berry, John
Turner, James Nash and Luther.
The letters 11 points was high
for both teams.

With a 24 to 10 lead at the
half, Coach Truesdale's men could
afford to substitute freely and
save themselves for tonight’s bat<
