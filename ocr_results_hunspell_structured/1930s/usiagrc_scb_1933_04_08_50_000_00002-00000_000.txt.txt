AGREEMENT

Last year at the first convention of the state
college conference on International Relations, two
men, Robert W. Coleﬂesh, statc American Legion
commander, and Frederick J. Libby of the National.
Council for the Prevention of War, were scheduled
to debate hotly the question of preparedness
against War. Strangely enough, however, they
agreed on the point that if disarmament is possible
internationally, it is the logical means toward
permanent peace. In their addresses, Libby showed
the defects of the theory of military sccuity, \i'hilc
Coleﬂcsh pointed to the necessity for military sc~
curity until dishrmament is placed on an inter-
national planc, .

This year, so far as we know, none of the
speakers have taken the standpoint that military
security must be maintained at present. We would
like to have heard that standpoint expressed again
fit this session. Robbi Albert I Gordon of Mimic-
apolis, Minn, whose address is reported in another
part of this paper. seems to have one of the clam»
est plans for impressing the hor 01's and atrocities
of war on the minds of youth. Yet, what is to bc
donc about tllcilnmedintc present? Is the United
States to disarm as the leader of a uloi'cilient,
counting upon the other major nlitiolls to follow?
Or is she to wait until all international agreement
is reached if over? Those are the questions ii'hose
answers seem to elude Speakers,

In the meantime, nilti Ull' education as Rabbi
Gordon proposc‘ should be a port oi‘ the li llllllg’
of youth. Even in it small scope, the Slate colic:
conference hero is performing- it great work.

WHAT WILL THEY SAY?

\Vc’l‘c fiist wondering what comlllcnccmcnt
ol-ators will say to the thousands of college seniors,
who sit bcforc them at the tillal exercises, this your.

Herctofore, the college mtin or ii'onlnn has bccll
looked upon lis the “hope” that will go oilt illto
the world and put into practice the things he, or
she, learned in college.

But, gentle readers, what can that “hope” do
if he can’t even get a job?

There is not much use kidding ourselves into
believing that we’re all going to get jobs immctl-
iately after graduation—not even half of usisilicc
tllc bulk oi the class of 1982 is still on the lookout
for some of the same.

. This is a queer time to suggest that the col-
lege graduate use his enforced leisure toward get-
ting more education. Yet, if it is at all possible, that
is just about the best thing he can do.

College graduates are ill large numbers among
the unemployed now, but it is well to realize that
the time is coming when a college education will
bi: an absolute requisite for the smallest worth-
while job.

We’re still wondering what the colllnlcncc-
mclzt speakers will , )2

AN OUTSTANDING EVENT

One of the high spots of the local musical
season will be held this evening in Herrick chapel,
when the Grinncll college Men’s Glcc club will
present its thirty-ninth concert.

This concert, always outstanding, will be c
traordjnarily good this year because of the Vt icd
program to be offered and the excellence of thc
numbers.

Several years ago the local club won the mid-
western championship ill a contest at Chicago, and
rated high in the national meet at New York. At
the New York contest Grinllcll won the distinction
of being the best clilb West of the Hudson River.

Although financial conditions have made it
impossible to enter any contest in recent years,
the talent ill the club is just as superior as over,
and the llunibcrs this year should make it ollc of

the most outstanding OVCI‘ give ,

ARGHAIC CUSTOMS
(Dauy Trojan)

We may brag about our modern civilization and
pity our ancestors of the "dark yesterday", yet strange-
ly we are contented with archaic methods. Our method
of dealing with people, who can not or will not adjust

themselves to the complex ies of our society has not
changed fundamentally since the time white settlers
paid boiiuties for Indian scalups.

Our methods have only become more humane. We
are a queer people. If a man steals $10, more or less,
we send him to jail. By doing that, we tax ourselves
to support the said person, often in idleness, by keeping
and maintaining the Jail. In fact we work hard so that
we shall be able to pay our way through, and then
pay taxes, part of which goes to support idle persons,
who have injured us by riking- at us through dis-
regarding- our social fabric.

We usually pay no attention to the victims, except.
to send them to the morgue, or to the hospitals where
they will have to pay for their hospital expenses, or
to require them to net as witnesses. ,

Our criminal code arose from three ideals; to mac

’teet society, to reform the offender, and as a means of

revenge. It should be based on two fundamental ideas;

to protect society by educating the offender, to protect-

the victim by restoration of stolen property.

It is about time that we recast our criminal laws
to harmonize with the tunes. The dominating idea
should be redress for the injured. For example, the
men who stole s10 should be forced to repay it. No mat.
ter how poor he may he, he can pay it in installments
plus interest, If our crooks were forced to restore the
full value to their victims, they would be more careful
about walking the chalk line. It is easier to go to jail
for a few months than to earn and save $100 to repay
the victim. ,

Jails will be always needed, but they should he used
only as temporary means of confinement so that pris-
oners can be routed to the various institutions and hes-
pitals for proper treatment

WHAT IS SUCCESS?
(McGili Daily)

The other day a professor at an American univer-
sity, in speaking on the inconsistency of our systems
of education, made a. statement which is well Worth
consideration. “The success doctrine," he is quoted as
saying “means nothing more than to win at your neigh—
bor’s expense." He made reference, to prove his point,
to “the history of the vicious inﬂuences of the stock
exchange, the purchase for resale at pyramid prices"
of commodities, both useful and useless.

If this is true, if our education Serves merely to
instill in us the idea. that to be successful we must beat
the other man, then the system is truly inconsistent.
Success may be received from an absolute, as well as
a relative standard. We may consider that man Suc-
cessful, who achieves a. position superior to his fellow»
man; or, our conception of the successful man may he
of one who has improved his own position, without
considering his position relative to that of others.

If success can be achieved only by the exploitation
of others, then happiness is nothing more than a vain
ideal. How can we be happy when we must at all times
be suspicious of the efforts of our neighbors, when we
must crush them, or be crushed?

But why not look at success from another point of
View? If we measure our success, not by our position
relative to others, but according to the advance we have
made over ourselves as We were, then there will be room
for ambition on the part of everyone, and if success is
attained, it will be at the expense of none, and to the
advantage of all.

BARGAINS IN BRAINS
(Kentucky Kcl-nal)

A pamphlet titled, “Bargains in Brains”, is the
most recent step that seniors or the Commerce college
have taken to obtain employment after graduation, The
booklet contains information about each prospective
applicant and will he uselul to business concerns in pro-
curing employees.

During the present economic depression it becomes
more difficult for college graduates to find employment
no matter how thoroughly trained they are. It is-
necessary fnr students to use every available method
which may lead to positions warranting the speeializs~
tion resulting from higher academic pursuits.

That prospective graduates of the Commerce college
have realized the necessity for aggressiveness is manic
fasted in "Bargains in Brains." By indicating Kerk
tueky‘s contribution to 1933 business, and by supplying
employers with information about applicants, they have
enhanced their prospects of obtaining that type of work
for which they have been trained, ,

EDUCATIONAL THEORY
(Duily Northwestern)

In order to measure the. effectiveness of the pres-
ent theory of education, we mu'st have a definite stand-
ard which denotes the desired ends. Any sound educa-
tional program should have two ends: first, to give
definite knowledge: secondly, to create those mental
bits which will enable people to acquire knowledge and
form sound judgments for themselves. The first of
these we may call training, the second intelligence. Any
program which fails to perform both of these functions
is unsatisfactory and an obvious failure.

It seems that our present theory satisfactorily pare
forms the first function. It does give definite knowledge;
in fact, ii: may be called a training school.

But to claim our present educational System ade-
quately performs the second function is to admit a faiiv
ure to observe accurately, and a complete unwillingness
to face the facts. After being forced into numerous
courses in which he is not interested, he acquires a dis-
taste for knowledge that clings indefinitel his atti-
tude becomes apathetic. A premium is placed on
memory and acceptance of the words of the professor.
The mental habit formed is complete willingness to
accept the judgments of others. There is no motiva-
tion to induce the student to think independently and
form his own judgments. He is to be a mere parrot, re-
peating the words of others. If we are to accept this
second function as a desirable end, oiir present theory
is definitely unsatisfactory.

MEDDLERS
(Southern Caluornia Daily Trojan)

What business have our citizens in foreign coun-
tries to stir up trouble? We are thinking of those natur-
alized American citizens who ruffled the German polit-
ical mud puddle by not minding their own business. The
newspapers blared with the “incident," but had the good
sonse to drop it, ,

When we were small and dated on the nickel mov-
ies, we used to cheer when a great warship leaped
madly acmss the screen over mountainous Waves to
the rescue of the manly hero who was the only barrier
between the defiant yet ridiculous brunette heroine
(Blondes Weren’t in the Style then), and a thousand or
more assorted howling yellow or 1)le devils in Serial
No. 23.

Editor, The Scarlet and Black
Dear Sir:

During the recent epidemic, there
were about 29 men at the dormitor-
ies who were confined to Lheir rooms.
It was necessary for someone to
supervise their special diets, get it
to them in trays, and arrange for
the collection of the trays and dishes.
This had to be done three times a
day, over a period of about a week.
Mrs. Miller jumped in, with her usual
willingness, and organized a system
of food distribution for the sick men.

Mrs. Miller is the housemother of
Langan hall, and director of the
dormitory kitchen and dining—rooms.
She performed her regular duties, in
addition to supervising the food for
the sick. The latter job required much
extra time and labor. Mother Miller
did it cheerfully and diligently. All
the sick man got well. Perhaps they
owe a vote of thanks and apprecia-
tion to Mrs. Miller.

Tuesday

pres. John 5,
Nollen spoke on
the present bank—
ing situation.

“We must not
be surprised”, he
said, “at the rail.
. lire of the best
minds to solve difficult problems
dealing with human beings in enor-
mous numbers, in all conditions, all
over the world.”

“Hoarding by banks is compelled
by the banking situation, but it is
not much more wholesome to have
great sums of money tied up in bank
vaults than in private hands, Banks
that have opened are impeded in their
business because it is necessary to
maintain a high degree of liquidity.”

“The result has been that where—
as the purpose of this action has been
to restore confidence, up to date, the
reverse has been the case. one duty
of people of education is not to talk
unless they have facts on which to
base what they have to say, and to
avoid all undue discussion until
action has been taken toward the
settlement of this difficult situation."

Wednesday

Joseph Conard, chairman of the
executive committee for the Inter—
national Relations conference, spoke
