AN ADVANTAGE UNCOVERED.

Dr. Walter Silz, Harvard exchange lecturer this
year. called to our attention in an interview recently
printed in the Scarlet and Black some of the advantages
of the small college which, as be said, "Grinnell has and
probably takes for granted." In other words, they are
factors in our everyday life which we do not stop to ap-
preciate.

Principally, Dr. Silz Spoke of the friendly atmo-
sphere and the informal and intimate life which he ﬁnds
on Grinnell's campus and stated that the larger univer-
sities are trying to build this spirit. It is hard. how—
ever, to imagine the same spirit of unity prevailing
among several thousand students as is possible with the
seven-hundred who are grouped together here in close
and iriendly relations.

Perhaps it is a unity of purpose which causes a
better spirit of unity in the smell college. There being
only one school. all students come to take the work of
that group of studies, those of liberal arts. They are
all working for nearly the same goal, either to enter the
business world or to take postvgra'dudte work.

On the other hand, students or the large universities
have many diverse goals. They are looking forward
to all types of professions and specialties in business.
Each individual has become centered on his own goal
which may differ considerably from that of his neigh-
bor. There are not so many common points pf contact
between students as there are in the smell college.

Whatever the cause, such a spirit of unity should
he considered as an outstanding social advantage of .the
smell college. Such unity leads to democracy within
the walls of the college Democracy leads to good will

,to ones neighbors, in other words to a spirit of social
unity which is so necessary to the contacts which stu-
dents will have to make with the world after leaving
college. Some say that the small college builds up
an attitude of provinciality. This is probably true, but
at the same time, it builds up this feeling of goodwill
in social contact. Frovinclality wears off quickly when
one leaves the place in which it was built up, but four
years training in democracy can scarcely fall off our
shoulders as easily.

Although Grinnell may take for granted this unity
and intimate life, it must realize that such a spirit is a
cultural advantage of this and of other small colleges.

TH]? GRI‘NNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

EACH To HIS TASTES.

Early in the month, there was printed in this
column an exhortation to remember the date of Febru-
ary 27 as mat of Norman Thomas appearance on the
speaking platform at Grinnell. Later in the month.
there appeared an appeal that we save part of our
time to attend the Varsity debates which are being held
at intervals in the AER. auditorium.

A misfortune it is that both the lecture and a de»
bate will take place on the some evening, Norman
Thomas speaking at 7:15 tomorrow evening and the
debate taking place afterwards. It is hardly the place
of this organ to urge attendance at both of these inn
teresting features of the Week’s program as that would
be in view of coming exams, highly inadvisable. How-
ever, we can advise that each take to his own tastes in
choosing between the two events and make the best of
a good opportunity by going to hear one of the two
speaking activities. 3, n, T.

THE FUTURE OF CHAPEL.

Now that the Scarlet and Black has completed its
chapel poll, the lasting impression made by the in—
vestigation is that, no matter what the hour, or what
the nature of the programs, the chapel service at Crin-
nell has lost its attraction to most of the student body.
They are just indifferent to the service, that is all,and
it is doubtful if any changes would fill the chapel as in
days gone by. This is a regretable condition. but it is
merely in line with the present tendencies among college
students to give religious services of any kind a sec-
ondary place in their life, and if the Crinnell student body
is no better than student bodies elsewhere in this re-
spect, certainly it is no worse.

All this does not mean that the chapel service
should be discontinued. 0n the contrary, the student
poll on the question showed that those who voted were
anxious to continue it, and that to them the period of
twenty minutes at the beginning of the day was an in-
tegral part of their life at Crinnell.

what, then, will be the future of chapel at Grin—
hell? it will likely continue to attract the same small
number as it does at present, to whom it remains of
real value. The Scarlet and Black believes, however,
that whether it is practicable or not to the administra-
tion, a return to the 10 o'clock chapel hour would mate
terislly increase attendance at chapel. this judgment
being based on the votes cast in the poll and by student
discussions which were overheard.

If some of the suggestions for chapel programs were
also put into effect, namely, to have more music,
to have speakers talk from notes rather than
read their speeches, to have informational talks
predominate over the devotional type of speech,
and to have previously announced programs—these im-
provements in the present plan of conducting chapel
ought to increase attendance.

As a. paper seeking to reﬂect student opinion. the
Scarlet and Black recommends that these changes be
made in so far as possible, along with a return .to the
10 o‘clock hour.

Whether or not, however, this can be done, the
chapel service should be maintained, and to every stu-
dent on the campus, we commend the support of this
Crinneii tradition whose value is being underestimated
in the student world of classes. dances, athletics and
dollars and cents.
