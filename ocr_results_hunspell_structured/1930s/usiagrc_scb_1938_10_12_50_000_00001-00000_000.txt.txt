Kerr Renews
Campaign for
Alumni Funds

Plans of Drive to Be
Presented to Clubs
In 7 Large Cities

Continuance of a campaign be-
gun last year for national alumni
funds was made known today by
R. Y. Kerr, executive secretary.

The drive. according to Kerr,
will be based upon alumni inter—
est in the college and its work,
and not upon any sense of moral
obligation,

Started Last Year.

The campaign was started last
year at Crinncll and will be con-
tinued in several of the larger
cities this year. Alumni clubs in
New York City, Washington, D.
C, Boston, Chicago, Des Moines,
Minneapolis and St. Paul will
have the plan or the campaign
presented to them soon.

Kerr described the campaign in
Crinoell last year as ”Very suc—
Cessful.” adding that 130 contri-
butions were received.

Outline of Campaign.

Following is a brief outline of
the alumni campaign as organs
ized by Kerr last year:/

1. The Alumni council, elected
by graduates and former students,
is the working iorce of the cam-
paign.

2. Solicitation or gifts is made
by alumni and not by the college.

a. The college office and the
council are responsible to see that
Grinnell alumni receive adequate
information as to what the col-
lege is doing from time to time.

4. Solicitation is made each
year when alumni are asked to
contribute what they can afford.

5. The whole project; is under
the continuous control of alumni.
and the uses to which the money
is put is determined by alumni
representatives on the council.

6. Money raised is currently
spent and not added to the en-
dowment.

professor of journalism and new-
ly elected president of the board,

was tabled until the next meet-
ing.

Control Controlling Board.

Under an arrangement of this
sort, as was suggested by the fac-
ulty committee last spring, the
board of directors of: the Grinnell
student Publishing company
would become a central controll-
ing board for all publications on
the campus, rather than only for
the Scarlet and Black, as the or-
ganization now stands.

As such a body, the board
would determine the staffs of the
different publications, would over-

Of Discovery of America Today

pedition is a grave error. lsabella
had long before given her jewels
to the Moors to keep them out of
Spain.

The man who really financed
the voyage was Luis cle Sent ,Anr
gel, treasurer of Aragon. He gave
four million mal'ztvedis. Exploding
the myth that Columbus was a
poor, needy Sailor is the fact that
he advanced 500.000 maravedis
himself. The total of the whole
thing was about $100,000 in our
money.

September 6, 1492, Columbus
with three ships set sail from Co-’
mere in the Canaries. After over
a month of staining straight west,
land was sighted on the night of
October 11. The next day, 446
Vears ago today, Columbus set
foot upon land somewhere in
either Cuba or the Bahamas. The
exact site is unknown.

He was met by half naked,
nainted savages whom he called
llldians, He sailed to what. is now
Sin Domingo, and then returned
‘n Will‘o‘ne unmindful of the great-
aass of his voyage.

Approved

Faculty Committee
Favors Additional
Grant to Musicians

Additional financial aid to the col-
lege band was approved yesterday
by the faculty committee on stu-
dent organizations and publica-
tions when it formally favored the
student Council's plan for read-
justment of the semester fee.

The committee also approved
the financial plan submitted by
the Camera club, including the
dark room now in the process of
being constructed.

Discussion of the sponsorship of
the Zephyr, campus humor maga~
zine, rose to a heat when it was
'suggested that an off the campus
firm temporarily sponsor the pub-
lication

The Zephyr still has no respon-
sible campus organization back»
ing, which is asked by the faculty
committee.

Action, however. was deferred
until Sigma Delta Chi, men’s n5»
tional honorary and professional
journalistic fraternity, meets to-
night to discuss the desirability
of backing the publication.

Sigma Delta Chi was formerly
sponsor of the Malteaser, humor
magazine which ceased publica-
tion three years ago.
