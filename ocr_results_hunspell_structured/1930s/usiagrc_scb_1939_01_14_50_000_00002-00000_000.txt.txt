THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE

Once a year the chief executive is called
upon to deliver a message to the Congress
on “the state of the union.” This year it
was again done in the superb style which
we hope will become customary with suc-
ceeding presidents.

The style and finish of the speech were
typically ado-Roosevelt. But the thing that
was most interesting was the thought con-
tent of his message. Here was a different
Roosevelt, one undoubtedly chastened by
recent reverses, and one more thoughtful
and persuasive, one less argumentative, one
keenly aware that he stands as the figure
if not the leader of the democratic idea
throughout the world, »

Walter Lippman, who for four years has
been quite critical of the president’s actions
and attitudes, has written that this recent
message of Roosevelt’s stands as a landmark
in the history of western thought. Why‘.7
Because in that speech the leader of a great
nation recognizes that for years and years
democracy has been cursed and weakened
by the excessive skepticism and secularism
of its ideals, by the too ready willingness
of many of its adherents to overlook if not
to sacrifice national aims for remote inter—
national goals.

Here the president paid more than lip
service to the necessary fact that religion
is the fountain head of democracy. The se»
cularism and skepticism of the last 100
years, which' has infested the democratic
idea has almost wrecked the foundations of
democracy.

Because the president has seen these
things, because peoples everywhere are
seeming to become aware of these things,
and because these facts have been pro-
claimed and accepted by a great nation, it
is said that this message is a landmark in
the history of western thought and likely to

signalize the arena in which democracy Willi
take its stand.

WHAT In YOUﬁNF

As was hoped, last Saturday’s editorial,
“Is Grinnell Slipping?” has caused quite
some comment 'on the campus and off the
campus. We are particularly pleased by the
comment it aroused from the student body
itself. We are particularly satisfied by the
favorable comment which we have received
from alumni and friends of the college.
Whether there was any merit in the editor-
ial can only he found through intelligent
discussion of the question by the readers
themselves.

We are very appreciative of the two let—
ters to the editor which appeared in
Wednesday's Scarlet mid Black. Students as
a whole are naturally reluctant to make
themselves conspicous as individuals by
committing themselves on paper in letters
to the editor,‘ but in a question of this kind
we want both sides discussed openly and
fully.

Such a letter need not he a literary mas-
terpiece, but merely express the student’s
opinion on the subject. Any such expression
of opinion should, because of our limited
Space, not exceed 250 words. In any letters
to the editor, if the writer so desires, only
his initials need appear in print so long as
the editor has on file the name of the writ-
er.

If any student feels that he has all opin-
ion he would like to express, pro or coil, on
the subject of last Saturday's editorial we
hope that he will not hesitate to do so in a
letter to the editor. All letters to the editor
will appear in the ”Open Forum” and as
such they may or may not conform to the
paper’s editorial poli

HATS OFF TO lllE GLEE CLUB

It is with a great deal of pleasure that we
learn of the appointment of F. Walter Huff~
man as director of the Men‘s Glee club. The
working agreement by which Mr. Huffman
has agreed to direct the glee club in return
for the glee club members helping Mr. Huff-
man with the Pioneer chorus should benefit
both the glee club and the Pioneer chorus
materially. It was essential, of course, that
the glee club find a director as soon as pos-
sible.

The year 1939 is here and it is time to
be thinking of a spring totlr. No one fails
to realize the importance of these annual
tours both as an advertisement for the col-
lege and as a means of rebuilding a walling
glee club prestige.

Although getting a late start, it will be
a real accomplishment if the glee club un»
der the able directorship of Mr. Huffman
can prepare itself for Zt successful spring
tour. Of course, these tours need support,
and it is to be hoped that the organization
will receive adequate funds with which to
conclude a successful trip.

Mr. Huffman is one of the best men that
could have been found for the job. He is a
graduate of Oberlin college and a graduate
student from lows university. Before com<
illg to Grinllcll, he was a lecturer ill music
at the university from 1932 to 1936.

We ' all well aware of his popularity
as a v ice instructor here at Grinncll, and
we are deeply appreciative of his work as
director of the Pioneer chorus. We wish him'
the best of success.

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLAJCK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

I read with grcat interest your
editorial, “IS Grinncll Slipping?"
in last Saturday’s issue of the
Scarlet and Black. I cannot help
but agree very much with the
policy expressed in that editor»
ial.

As a sophomore at Gl'lnnell I
have harl the opportunity of be-
coming acquainted, not only with
Grinncll but with other colleges
of its me throughout the middle
west. One cannot help but notice
the difference brought about by
aggressive administrations in othe
er institutions. One cannot escape
the convicton that other schools
are passing Grinnell.

Before I came to Grinnell, I
had heard much and had a great
deal of experience with Grinnell’s
wonderful reputation as the out-
standing educaticnal institution of
the middle west. In the compaxar
tively short time that I have been
here, I have seen where Grinnell
is not wholly living up to its
past reputation.

As one who likes Grinnell and
wants to see it get ahead, I can-

not help but agree with the san-
timent expressed by last Setup
day’s editorial.

—P. T, it.

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

Since I am sincerely interested
in Grinnell’s future, the editorial
in last Saturday's paper interest-
ed me very much.

1: “Grinnell is slipping," it is
high time that all those interest-
ed in her welfare should take
note. I, therefore, congratulate
the Scarlet and Black for its re-
cent tachul, straight»forwara edis
tonal of which 1 have heard no
adverse criticism.

THE EDUCATION
OF A ,DIPLOMAT

By Hugh Wilson.
In 1910, Hugh Wilson, having
completed a college education,
three years in business, and 25
years of life, decided to forsake
the business world of his family
and enter the diplomatic service
of his country.

On the advice of Huntington
Wilson, first assistant secretary
of State, he enrolled for a year

of study in the Ecole Libre dcs
Sciences Pulitiques in Paris. In
1911, he entered diplomatic serv-
ice when he accepted the position
as secretary to Edwin Morgan,
Minister at Lisbon.

After thus serving his appren-
ticeship, Wilson passed his exam-
inations, and in January 1912 was
appointed charge d‘affaires in
Guatemala.

He held this position for two
years, after which he became
successively Secretary of Lega-
ticn in Bucnos Air-es, Second
Secretary at Berlin, and, when
the United States declared wilr.
a member of the legatinn
Switzerland.

in

Although Wilson has held many
positions since then and is now
the assistant secretary of state,
it is of this first period of service
that he writes. Wilson has set
down in his book tales of his
private and diplomatic lifc. (les—
oriptious of the people with whom
he worked nnd the countries in
which he lived, and scattered
through the p\ages arc bits of his
1own philosophy.

‘ The book is short, takes a very
little time to read, and is der
lightful in the simple, tactful
presentation of the life of a dip
lomst, it is in the college library
