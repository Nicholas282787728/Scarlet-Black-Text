Opposition Weak
in Titan Contests

(Continued From Page 1)

"and now we must face the harder
games on the schedule without the
knowledge of what they will be able
to do under pressure.

“Our offense has functioned well, of
course, but the opposition was of the
type, that almost any tgam could
have looked good against Now we
must look to the games with Grin-
nell and West Virginia, our next two
objectives, without having a true line
on the worth of our material and
what it will do when the going gets
‘tough'.”

Powerful Olfcnse anlo'ng
Critics pointed out that the ends
and the tackles have not been called
upon to meet a powerful offense, and
tor that reason judgment of them
must be held in abeyance until they
encounter a good passing and hard
running attack.

Others seemed to hold the same
opinion. They considered the Titans
a powerful array, in spite of the
coaches’ opinions that the team still
is an unknown quantity.

Part of the answer, at least, to
the debate now prevalent regarding
the actual strength of the Titans
should be obtained Friday night
when G'rinnell, one of the strongest
teams in the Missouri Valley, furnish-
es the opposition.

of favor against ,lowa Wesleyan and
being given a chance against Mar-
quette, is the standing of the Grin-

hell football team on the eve of the

University of Detroit contest.

But the dopesters have frowned
upon Grinnell before only to see their
decisions reversed, and Coach L. L.
Watts huskies still demand a chance
against the Tigers at the Detroit
stadium Friday night.

Scrimmages on Schedule

Taking little notice of the bruises
and hurts of his team, Coach Watt
put his men through long and stiff
practices the early part of the week.
Monday afternoon saw the varsity
men scrimmaging the freshmen, with
emphasis on the play of the line.
The backs worked on the timing of
their plays.

mentor again pitted his regulars a~
gainst the yearling squad, drilling
on line drives. lateral passes, and the
usual air attack. The scrimmage
lasted for two hours, and the length
of the workout, combined with the
recently sustained injuries gave the
team somewhat of a feeling of un-
certainty.

Varsity I-crsormel Same
There has been no change in the
first string. Ullrich has been taking
Capt, Ben Douglas place at fullback,
while the Pioneer captain stays on
the sideline with rib injuries. Douglas
will be in trim for Friday's encoun-
ter. McCreary has been carrying the
hall in fine style in scrimmages, and
is giving Hensley a run for u halfback

job. Most of the team took some hard ‘
pounding from the heavy Marquette
team, but no serious injuries resulted
and the Pioneers will probably start
the same lineup as they have used in
the last two games.

Leave Tomorrow Noon

The eleven includes Minier and Bil-
to, ends; Walker and Humphrey,
tackles; Norton and Bradford,
guards; Christoifcrsen, center; Thom-
as, quarterback; Ruff and Hensley,
halfbacks, and Douglas fullback.
While Ullrich and McCreal-y may not
start, it is likely that these two men
will see plenty of action during the
game.

The team will leave for Detroit
Thursday noon. Twenty-four men will ,,
make the trip,
