A WORTHY TRADITION,
Last Wednesday, the Scarlet and Black alt-

uouliced that the Honor G. club had planned

to pllt a stop to smoking on the central cam-
pus. '

It has always bceli a tradition that there
shall be no smoking on this section of the
Grinnell campus from sun-up to sun—downl
For the past several weeks Griiiliell students

‘ have almost forgotten this tradition and it is
no longer uncommon to see men students
smoking on the lawn in frolit of the Alumni
(litecitation hall and the library during the

ay.

Some traditions are apt to be far-fetched
and foolish, but this non-smoking tradition
is commendable It makes for a more at-
tractive campus and a better appearance,

There is no reason why Grinnell students
should be lax about this matter because it is
not a written law. Try to co-operate with
the Honor G club in maintaining this tradi»
tion and in making the campus more attrac-
tive. It is a‘ worthy tradition,

A SUGGESTION ON FUTURE VOTING.

The election held Thursday night once
again demonstrated the weakness of tho stil-
dent primary election system.

As ill past years, Grililiell students were at
a lo. , Thursday night, to know for whom to
vote The election had received little publi»
city and the students were not prepared to
cast their ballots. As a result, the election
was taken by many persons asa joke. Many
votes were cast for unqualified persons in an
effort of some students to be funny.

Several things could.have been done by the
Student council which would have made the
primary elections more effective.

The Council could have issued prepared
lists of those persons eligible for the presi—
dency of the student body. In this way, the
students would have had the names of all
qualified students before them and a better
choice could possibly have been made. No
eligible person wollld have been overlooked
if such a system were used.

A second solution to this question might
be as follows: The Student council through
a nominating- committee might have present—

‘ed the names of a number of persons whom
they felt to be well tted for each office.
This with the provision that other persons
not nominated could be voted upon if the

\

students should believe that those\persons
designated were not well-qualified. In a
like manner to the first suggestion this
would have given the student body fewer
persons to consider.

Under the present student primary rules,
countless ballots are wastedesometimes bc-
cause students are trying to be funny; other
times because the vote is scattered among
such a large field of candidates. Under the
present system any junior man is eligible for
the presidency of the council, alid any person
except a senior is eligible for the chapel alld
pep committees.

If the student primary s to be worthwhile
some new system must be devised to aid the
students in selecting; capable nominees. N

A PROGRESSIVE STEP.

The action of the state board of education
in eliminating algebra and piano gcmn try as
entrance requirements to the University of
Iowa and Iowa State Teachers’ college is to
be commended

These subjects will, of course, still be l' -
quired of students who intend to specialize
in technical work, but those who choose a
liberal arts cou sc will no longer be burdened
in high school with these subjects which have
little practical value

Algebra and geometry, while they are abe
solutely necessary to an understanding of
physic , engineering, and other highly spec-
ialized fields, are rarely applicable to every-
day life aiid are easily forgotten by most
students.

The abolition of this mathematics require-
ment leaves more time for work in elective
subjects in which the student is more inter-
ested. Progressive colleges are realizing
more and more that the old order of hard
and fast rules for what their students mllsl
or must not know should give way to satisfy»
ing individual needs, and these needs are too
diversified to expect everyone to conform to
the same pattern. I

Audience Enjoys Program
at Annual Concert
Thursday

uy itiln M. rhelps

In their nnnual home concert
Thursday night, the members at
the Grinch college Men's Glee
club maintained the high standard
of musicianship they have so well
established in the past 42 years.
The order with which the men
entered into the opening number,
“The Clipper Days" by Jordan, in-
sui‘ctl the succe - of the concert.
and although the men appeared
to rely on Prof. D. E. Peck for
entrances in this selection, the tie
pen'dence on a leader was not ob-
vious throughout the remainder of
the program,

Mr Peck should he justly cone
plimented on a superb job of di-
recting. Few people realize how
many times he found it necessary
to change the personnel of the club
which nevertheless showed a splen-
did balancc of tone in all its
work, and sang with such artistic
expression the “Vesper Hymn" by
Beethoven. The quartet did its
group, Haydn-s “Maiden Fair”
and Gibson's “The Elf Man" with
effective interpretation and the
audience applauded enthusiasti-
Cally, but in vain. for another
humorous number.

Bast Work in Closing Niunhris

The men did their best work in
the closing numbers of the pro
grain. The Spanish ballad “Cas-
tillo" by Protheroe is admirably
suited to male voices, and the
sonorous crescendo: and contrast-
ing diminuendos were nicely exe-
cuted.

IS THE STUDENT ALWAYS AT FAULT?
(Daily O'Collegii‘m)

it is understood by student and instructor alike
that cheating is not a proper method to be employed
by the student in classroom procedure,

But why is it that this form of improper proce-
dui- so strikingly prevalent on A. and M,'s cam-
pus? why is it that such a large proportion of the
Aggie student body has ’no scrupies concerning this
matter?

Naturally the problem is an essentially personal
matter. the student himseli being the one at fault,
But as the result of over two years of college the
writer is becoming more and more convinced that
the ultimate cause of cheating often rests not on the
shoulders of the student body, but on those of the
facility.

In many cases on this campus the instructor is
literally a Hitler. making no attempt to cooperate
with the students, but making his course as diuicult
as possible to pass and giving exams that he admits
he expects only it few of the class to pass. And it
is hard to realize why many students try any means,
fair or foul. to pass such it course. Though cheating
in this case is still not right on the student's port,
much of the responsibility for it can be traced to
the student's actions.

Then here is the opposite and more numerous inc
stance in which the instructor is apparently so lazy
that he uses the same multiple choice exam year
after year, making no changes in it at all. This
makes it a cinch for the poorest student in the class
to obtain a key, use it during the exam, and come
on with an A grade, while a better student with
scruples concerning cheating uses his own head and
more than likely receives a lower grade. Again
the cause or temptation for cheating is louuded by
the teacher. -

This article is not written to excuse the student
in his practice of this misdemeanor, put to point out
that the teacher‘s attitude and methods of teaching
can easily be as great a cause tor cheating -as the
student's own attitude.
