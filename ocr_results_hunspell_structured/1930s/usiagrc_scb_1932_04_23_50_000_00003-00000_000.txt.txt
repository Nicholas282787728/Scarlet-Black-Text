ton into Faust. The words he puts into

the mouth of Faust are at times

quite impossible coming from the

character; they are only possible

coming from Goethe himsclf.
Iicproduees Folklife

“Goethe reproduces the colorful
folklife of the Rhine. He used classic-
al forms but he was still grounded in
the German soil. He aided in leading
the thoughts of the eighteenth cen-
tury into the nineteenth century, and
was a unifying force between the
two.

“But as for Goethe and the modern
worlditl'lel'e is only one connection,
that is the low of self—determination.
This law, which was given over to
America by the French revolution,
has enabled her to create here a
great independent nation.

“Now the modern machine has
dominated all. Has there been any
self-determination left to unify the
forces of the present with the eter-
n31? Goethe is the answer. His poetry
is eternally symbolic of the use of
self-determination in the search for
truth."
