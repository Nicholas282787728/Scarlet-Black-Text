Norris Recalls Memories
of 50 Years Spent at Grinnell

Experiences of 50 Years
Related in Interview

With Reporter

By Franc . Hansen.

In the scientific clutter of his
office in Blair hall, Dr. Harry
Waldo Norris, research professor
of zoology. leaned back in an old
kitchen chair yesterday and re-
viewed the high spots of his ca-
rcer at Grinnell. Fifty years ag
this June, Drl Norris was gradlr
ated in the crass of 1886. At
commencement time he will be
honored as the beloved "Chief”
of the zoology department, the
man who knows more about the
traditions of the college and bears
more love for it than anyone else
alive today.

Dr. Norris began his reminis-
ccnces back when the college con-
sisted of three buildings in the
middle of a prairie, when the
man's dormitories were over the

 

 

lecture rooms, and “Women
weren’t supposed to be strong-
lnindcd enough to study the same
subjects as men," He told of the
famous Crinncll cyclone, which
he watched from a hill 10 miles
out of town. Most of all, he
talked of his life work and hobby
izaological research.

Growing up in a prairie Coulis

in 1579, he took the regular cnc

with almost no laboratory work.
“I got tired of waiting for the
class;" Dr. Norris said, “so I
started on my own hookJ’ It has
been on his own hook, studying
and experimenting alone, that the
“Chief” has done his most valua-

State Meet May 30

“Grinllell will not enter the state
track meet,“ G, Lester Duke, var»
sity track‘coach, stated yesterday,
“because of too many conflicts
with examinations.” The final day
cision was made by the faculty
athletic committee yesterday aft-l
ernoon.

Thc Ploneers' hopes of finishing
well up in the standings at the
meet at Amos on May 29 and so,
had been strengthened by their
achievements at the Missouri val-
lcy conference meet, held at Tulsa
last week, where the Pioneers fin-
lshed in third place.

Score Heavily in 440

In the Adonyard dash, Grinnell's
runners won a first, second, and
fourth place to score nine points in
that one event, Capt. Don Barnes
led the field, closely followed by
John Hess, who placed second.
Don Bentley was the other Plan
ncer who placed, finishing fourth

Aggies.

Roger Nelson was the only other
Grinnellian to take it first, winning
the pole vault with a leap of 12
