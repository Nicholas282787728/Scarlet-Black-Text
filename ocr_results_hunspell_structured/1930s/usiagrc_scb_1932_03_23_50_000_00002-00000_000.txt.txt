UNFAIR
(From the Daily Northwestern)

Once again a propaganda organization is circulating
its qllestionaires among college students and using the
results to support the contentions of the propaganda,
This time it is the Crusaders Against the Eighteenth
Amendment who arc spreading their doctrine via the
survey method.

Ouerlumdrcd-seven De Paul university students
were recently asked a series of seven questions on pro-
hibition by n committee under Colonel Ira L. Reeves.
The results of that survey were announced as proof of
tint particular campus' attitude toward the Eighteenth
Amendment.

In the first place, 107 out of a strident body as
large as De Paul’s cannot presume to speak officially
for the entire university. If Colonel Reeves and his
committee were sincerely interested in determining the
"attitude of mid-western universities toward national
prohibition” and not in promoting their own Views, they
would have reached a far larger number of students.

In the second place, the questions used in the survey
were not phrased in such a way as to insure a fair
answer, As example, take the two following questions:

1. Do you believe the present generation should do
Cept at face value the eighteenth amendment and the
national prohibition laws?

2. Do you believe that the present generation should
take an active part in modifying. amending. or repealing!
the amendments and the laws passed thereunder so as
to meet the present day conditions?

Those are the two fairest and most subtly phrased
of the seven proposition placed before the De Paul stu-
dents. Tile others even mole hnloily suggested answers
favorable to the Crusaders‘ cause

There is no need and no justification for any organir
zationIs employing dishonest questionaires for disscm»
mating theirIpropaganda, There is little doubt that. the
majority of intelligent collegiate opinion is aware of
the faults and inconsistenci s of our present prohibi~
tion laws. But it is an insult to seek expression of that
opinion by the means that Colonel Reeves and his Cru-
saders have employed.

If they are to conduct at survey, let them approach
at least 50 percent of the group whose opinion they wish
to determine, and let them phrase their questions in
such a way as to get sincere and uninflueuced answers.

ACTIVITIES AND SCHOLARSHIP
(From the Minnesota Daily)

students who do not participate in extracurricular
activiti s in college because they fear their meiks will
suffer no longer can use this excuse according to an
investigation conducted here by Dr 0. Myking Mellus
of the social science department of the Missouri state
Teachers college. His survey shows that the students
who take part in the most campus activities tend to
receive the highest grades while those who participate
in no activity get the poorer grades,

It is an established feet that success in college is
usually followed by success in after life. If a student
is a good scholar it is very likely that be will be able
to use his intelligence along other lines as well,

individuals who say that they IInevenIt timeII for
anything but their studies virtually admit that their
mental capacity is not great enough to take in a range
CI occupation, Those people who are active in dramatics
or publications almost invariably stand well in their
classes since the faculties they employ in these activities
serve them in the classroom,

CAPTURES IMAGINATION
(From the Daily Tropui)

The Poetry Playhouse, tried as an experiment this
week at Southern California, is receiving national some
mondation after several performances and the sponso .
of this unique entertainment have satisfied themselves,
as well as the fortunate few who have witnessed the
show, that the plan can be as successful here as it has
been in England.

Southern California can claim the distinction of be-
ing the first place in America where a definite play~
house and organization has been maintained for the
physical and vocal expression of poetic rhythm. Other
groups thruout the country have tried the verse choir
experiment in the past, but none of them has been
permanent.

The actors, playing to the cadences of poetry spok-
en by a choir of 20 voices in the small and intimate
theater, have captured the fancy and stirred the imag-
ination of their select audiences. Further showings are
anticipated with interest. It is quite likely that other
groups will follow the example of s. c. and develop
this phase of art.

Colﬂesh Qualified
to Speak on War

(Continued from page 1)

In February, 1913, he enlisted in
the army, expressed preference for
aviation find was sent to Fort. Logan,
Colo. Shortly afterward he was among
300 men ordered oveisees unattached
en the U. s. s, Huron. Eight hundred
miles out the vessel was rammed by
the Aeolns in the convoy and forced
to put back to New York, The men
then boarded the Krooniand bound
for Tours. From Tours they were sent
to Paris, then back to be informed
that their records had been lost.

Untrained in Trenches

Colflesh landed in company M,
Seventh infantry, near Cierey. He
was handed a rifle and sent into the
front line. Not a particle of military‘
training had he ever hurl. He knew
nothing about his weapon, but he,
learned rapidly.‘ He was on sentry
duty the first night, and was made a
corporal a few days later. i

His wounds were received later in
the fiercest fighting. He was struck
enemy steel at
Belleau Woods, At Fossoy, near Cha-
teau Tliierry, he was struck in the,
left shoulder, right leg, left knee and;
left foot. His Distinguished Service
Cress citation was received at that
time for “extraordinary heroism inl
action.” After his men had beeni
caught in an intense artillery shell-i
ing, corporal Colflesh, altho wounded,
refused to seek shelter until all his
men had taken cover.

Charter Member

After eonvalescing in a number of
hospitals, he was discharged Feb. 27,
1919 from the base hospital at Fort
Des Moincs, and in the fall matric-
ulated at George Washington univei
sity, wher‘e be attained an A. B. de-
grce in 1922 and an Li. B, in 1925.
While in college he was clerk of the.
house election committee and house
roads committee.

Celflesh is a charter member of
Argonne post, rind is a member of
the law firm of Parrish, Cohen.
Guthrie and Watters.

According to those who knew him,‘
wounds, hard work, and a drivingl
ambition have not hardened the ante
look ol Robert Colflesh. His sincere
beliefs on the most: efficient manner
in which nations may obtain security,
will be presented here Friday, April
8.
