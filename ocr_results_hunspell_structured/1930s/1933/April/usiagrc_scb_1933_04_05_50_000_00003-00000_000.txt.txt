A “strong mall" once gave public performances in
which he slapped a 9 lo. cannon hall shot from a
fully chalgul urinal-l. The audience gsspcd when
the gun ﬂushed and the human Gibraltar stepped
forward out of the smoke uninjured. with the 9 lb.
shut in his hands. '

EXPLANATION:

The lrick lay in die way an assistant prepared the
cannon for die performance. He used the rcgulatian
amount of powder and wadding, but placed the
glaze! pan of the charge of powder ahead of the
shot. The cannon hall was propelled only by the
small charge behind it which was just sufficient to
lob the 9 in. ball over to the strong man.

It’s fun to be fooled—

}...it’s more fun to KNOW

A performance sometimes staged
in cigarette advertising is the illu-
sion that cigarettes are made easy
on the throat by some special
process of manufacture.

EXPLANATION: All cigarettes are
made in almost exactly the same
way. Manufacturing methods are

standard and used by all. A ciga-
rette is only as good as the tobacco:
it contains.

M II is afau, well known by
leaf tobacco expertsﬁhut

Camels are made from ﬁner,
MORE EXPENSIVE lobaccos
than any other popular brand.

In costly tobaccos you will ﬁnd
mildness, good taste, throat-ease.

Smoke Camels critically, and
give your taste a chance to appre-
ciate the greater pleasure and sat-
isfaction offered by the more ex-
pensive tobaccos. Other cigarettes,
we believe, will taste ﬂflt and in-
sipid to you forever after.
