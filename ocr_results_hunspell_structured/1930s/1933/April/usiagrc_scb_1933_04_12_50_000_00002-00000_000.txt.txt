WORTHWHILE ENTERTAINMENT

The Vesper choir’s performance of Brnllms’
“Requiem”, to be given Fri ay morning, at 11
o’clock, in Herrlc chapcl, is particularly suited
to the occasion, since the first performance of the
work, in Germany, was also on Good Friday.

Further interest in tllc work at this time
comes from the fact that‘ tllis is the one hundredth
anniversary of the birth of Brahms, May 7, 1833

composed of selected members from tlle men s
and women's glee clllbs, the Vesper choir, ill addi~
tion to its regular tervicc, is carrying on a selios
of large choral works, wortlly of commendation.
Although the significance of these offerings is of-
ten overlooked by students, as more matte ‘ of
routine, a great deal of attention has been focl.ed
on the choir. by musicians from all over the Collll~
try. since the group performed the “Requiem”
earlier this year.

Becausc of the enhancement the college orches—
tra give to the choir’s programs, this select group
of nm clans has also been widely commented on
this , ea The orchestra, composed of advanced stu-
dents of lilllsic and members of the facility, has
been a feature of many of the program

The Vesper choir, ill addition to providing its
audiences with worthwhile entertainment, also

es its members all intense education ill group

LIMITING RADIO ADVERTISING

Like the farther who killed the goose that laid
the golden eggs, companies who sponsor radio ad
vertisillg appear liltcl, to defeat their own purposc
bv failing to lilliit their daily, nightly, or weekly
‘ gab-fests.”

Granted that such a company must advertise
if it is to contilluc on the air; granted that we as
radio listeners appreciate the splendid speakers,
music, and plays brought to lls by that company;
granted that the advertising itself may ill the long
rllll be beneficial to u. still we object to a pr
polldcrancc of such advertising, to the partial c.
clusion of the entertainment.

The Federal Radio collluli ioll allows a com-
pany to devote tcll minutes of its program to pure
advertising. However, by actual timing we have
found certain companies exceeding that limit by
two to eight minutes, and a number of small radio
stations frequentlv spend two~thirds of tllcir time
on the air with st- ight advertising.

We do not object to having the advertising
indirectly and subtly intermingled with the enter-
tainmcnt, as that given us by Bell Bernie on a
nlalt program, Ed \Vylln and Grahzml MacNanlec
on the Fircchicf broadcast, and Cap’n Henry on
the Showboat hour.

We are not especially averse to hearing about

It is the specialized individual sports such as track,
swimming and tennis in which Griiluell of late has
gained a sports reputation out of proportion to
the size of the school.

Distance runners here this year are among
the best in the count y. They deserve student and
school support. Gl‘illlicll‘s attraction for students
is not caused entirely b, its scholastic standing.

T0 DANCE LOVERS

All lovers of the dance should anticipate the
Dance Drama to be given May 5, by the women’s
physical education department.

An unusual and extremely interesting program
is to be carried out, including group dances, drama-
tizations, and characterizations done to music and
poetry. This should hold appeal for those interested
in par cipation as well as for those ill the audience.

Tllc dancing classes have been doillg homc crce
alive, u ork in interpretation and planning of dances
and all who have helped originate them believe
this is half the fun of dancing. .

Let it be understood. howcvcr, that participa-
tion ill this event is not restricted to members of
the dancing classes. Anyone who has the desire to
express herself ill dance is urged to try out.

Practices are being held each day at 4.30 p.nl.

Other Opinions

TESTING SINCERI'I’Y
(The Daily Nebrashanl

Two large student‘ organizations at Oxford and
Manchester universities in England, the famous Oxford
uion and the Manchester union, voted in a recent
discussion by a large majority, that the members would
“in no circumstances fight for its king and country."
In other words, the students have come to the conclu-
sion that the only effective method of preventing war
is to refuse to fight.

Conservative Englishmen, sons of aristocrats, in
one of the oldest and most conservative of English
universities! Imagine them declaring outright that they
will not fight in any war, no matter what thre circum-
stances. Ne longer do they believe in a "war to end
war," and a war “to make the World safe for democ-
racy.” They are convinced that war cannot accomplish
this or any other good purpose.

We doubt is there a university in this country
where as many students, (750 at Oxford, 371 at Man—
chester) could he induced to make this supposedly
radical declaration. Imagine the consternation of a few
01' the R. o .T. C, officers if such a vote should result
in some of their classes.

Most people are likely to be repelled by this absolute
pacifist stand. But. in view of the fact that war, rumors
or war, and vigorous preparations for war are continu-
ally going on, it begins to look like the only really
effective means of doing anything about preventing
Wilt.

This attitude is to be sincerely admired. Certainly
it is a consistent attitude for those who are opposed to
war. It might he vigorously recommended to the states~
men of the world that some such consistency should be
observed. This idea of signing peace pacts and their
building armaments indefinitely with the very definite
purpose of using them for war purposes, is becoming

tiresome.

The vast majority thought that this
country should be Willing to precede
other notions in the reduction of
armaments, on condition that the
other nations agree to similar reducA
lions. .

Somewhat more than half of those
voting favored complete independence
for the Philippines, while twoethirds
or them thought that the United
states should recognize Russia.
Nearly all felt that the private manti-
facture of arms should be prohibited,
and that the stimson doctrine should
be made a permanent policy of this
eountry.

Against Militiu‘y Education

As might be expected, the de
gates voted strongly against iii
tarisin in education. All but one vot-
ed to abolish all military training in
high schools, while only five were
not in favor of the abolition of enm-
pulsory military training in colleges.
Exactly two thirds advocated aboli-
tion of the citizens military training
camps.
