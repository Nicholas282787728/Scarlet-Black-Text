FINIS

\Vith today’s issue of The S let and Black.
the Hongh~Ralnsey management j llls the ranks of
the Allen—Rutherford, Canning-Stevenson, and
Clayton-Mor son combinations ill the background.

Saturday’s publication will be the first under
the control of the 193 1934 editor and business
manager, and will mark tllc beginning of the stu-
dent publication board’s second year.

We, the retiring management, don ’t know
whether to breath n sigh of relief, or of regret. at
relinquishing the responsibility which we have
felt tllu'ing the past year. Probably it will be both.

There are those, among our readers. wllo will
say we have not accomplished anything during ollr
regime. We hope there will be a few who think
otherwise.

True, our editorials have not resulted ill any
great and radical changes ill Grinncll, although
chapel is announced ill advance, now and than;
there appears to be a trend toward decision de-
batcs, and the campus drives were recently llllr
proved. After all, these are not life and death inat-
tcl's.

However, it does give us a little satisfaction to
know that we have done our best to maintain
and improve the standards set by previous mim-
agcments. ‘ '

We have not hesitated to say what we think.
concerning anything pertaining to the campus.
Perhaps we said too much—perhaps not enough.
Once or twice. \ve trod on the toes of the campus
Gods. If we were unjustiwe will be sorr 'to know
it. \Vc still believe firmly, that there are entirely
too many inactive organizations on this campus.
the functions of which appear to be the election of
officers, and the proud wen ing of pins.

So, we pass the paper oniwith the hope that
the new editor and business manager \v'll uphold
the standards long- ago I, that lhcy ill be fear-
le . in fighting for their ideals, always rcmclllbcr-
ing that they represent the students, and with

confidence ill thcil success.

STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES

Three major organizations represent Grilmell
students on the campus. The Council of House
Presidents represents men of the college, the \Vom-
0 Self Government league is the corresponding
orgnnizatioll for coeds, and the Student Council,
about which Grinncll students seem to know very
little represents the major activities of the school.

be more lilulilitir uith those governing bodies which

A MEN’S INFIRMARY

‘ln u ucll ordcl-cd collllllullity u person cone
(routing .t contagious discusc is either removed to
All isolzllioll hospital or kept ill his homo under
quv ltiuc ill order to prevent the spread of the
dlscrlsc. Ill the majority of (uses the patient prcr
TOI'S‘IG remain in his owll llousc l‘ﬂlllcl' than go to
2! hospital. The average patient does not like the
routine tllld the formal, unfamiliar surroundings
of ti hos iitnl.

In tile men’s dormitories, which is at very COIII‘
pact and intimate collmlunity, the sonic antipathy
to hospitals is to be found. \Vlly not all illl'irlllilry
for the lllcn'? It would serve the purpose of keep-
iug' thc men in the familial- surroundings of the
dormitories and yet prevent general contact with
the other students. It is difficult, almost impo '
as shown by the recent epidemic, to qua
tudents ill their own roolns ill the halls. An in-
fil-lnury would some this purpose.

A suggested place for such an illfirmory is
the tower floor ill Gates hall. The single room open-
ing off the hallway might be used for the nurse,
while the large corner room and the two smaller
roollls connected in suite fashion could easily be
turllcd into a hospital. That floor also has :1 kitchr
enette and toilet facilities. Ill fact during the war,
when the dormitories were new, that ﬂoor was
used for just that purpose. A resident llnrsc could
do a great deal to prevent the spread of cpidculics
such as we had here last week. While the house
llloihcrs do a great dcill ill preventing find checking
illnesses. they have neither the training- or the
equipment that a l dclét nurse would have.

SOPHISTICATED?

According to the llmgazincs devoted to colleg-
iate llnlnor, the college student of today is either
sophisticated, cynical, or hardrlloiled, or it combina-
tion of all three. The writers of humor magazines
Zil‘c not (he only ones who say college students
refuse to Show emotion; cditors, cduc'ttors, and
others have often lnzldc silnilur remar Perhaps
college men and women like to be thought of as
sophisticated and try to give that impression, but
really are they any loss sentimental ol- vcll to
emotions than the average person?

Previous to the production of Louisa )I. r\l-
cott‘s play, “Little Women," llcrc recently those
connected with it expressed some doubt if it would
find favor with a collegiate audience because of
its sentimentality and other strong clnotioll. ’l‘hcy
were surprised at the number uho attended the
performances and were more surprised at the atti-
tudc tnltrn towzird it. For believe it or not, tllcsc
sophisticated and hard-boiled college students (ile-
rordlng to the humor magazines) actually wcpt

and laughed with the actors.

Other Opinions

CLARENCE APPEARS DISCOURAGED
(Alabama, Cﬁmsolldﬂlim)

“If I were a young man with life ahead of lne, I
think I’d chuck it all, the way things are now. The odds
are too great against you . . . Things have never been
So dross.” That is the message of seventy-six year old
Clarence Darrow to American youth, At first we would
be inclined to contempt for such a cowardly utterance.
But then we consider its author. Mr. Darrow has been
a fighter all his lite. Many are the legal victories he
has won against hopeless odds. Many lives he has
saved when the saving seemed impossible. How can a
man with a career as brilliant as his say those despair—
ing words? Clarence Darrow is an iconoclast. For years
he has scoffed at the idea of a God. And those few
sentences above are an admission of defeat. The scoffer
finds life empty and hopeless without his God.
