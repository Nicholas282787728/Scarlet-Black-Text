VACATION

The Christmas vacation comes at a Try oppore
tulle time in the college calendar. T11 is thc time
of year when those students who inc burdened
with heavy class schedules and extr \‘tl‘l' ulnl'
activities are wondering whether they will he nlllc
to make llotll ends meet and arc beginning to (lo-
velop :1 helligcrcnt- attitude toward their associates
and surroundings.

With classes adjourning from Wednesday
noon ulltil two wccks from that day, the period
for relaxation and change of surroundings and at»
tiVities should be of long enough e ‘tcllt to rcfrc ll
students for their second semester d c. and stilli-
ulote 1111111 llicutallv for the first semester aniil-
illotiolls which follow slloltlv aftel the vacation
The charge, often made against sinll holidays that
they bleak the continuit of the school year is not
altogether tiue, we believe Those who hold p0 i-
tions in the business world realize tho ncces 11‘
for vacations and holidays, and there is this sonic
necessity ill collcgc regardless of comparisons
drawn between “the impractical, tlleol't‘tit‘nl (10],
lcgc life and the cold, cruel world.” Students who
have had experience ill both pha. es of life rcul c
that the modern coll ’ student wllo is making a
real attempt to obtain an education, and, at the
some time, i faced with the rcspol ibility ol‘ 0
ing part of his expenses has .1 more difficult joll
than the average \vhitcecollar workman, into whosc
shoes he will doubtles, step after graduation The
student‘s work is not ended at the close of a six
or eight-110111 da, ' nor is it limit of such nature
that he can forget it until the liioirow.

TAKING THE CRADLE

Harold L. Ickcs, secretary of the interior. rc-
cciltly announced the innovation of the Holllcstcad
Subsistence plan. Already completed are the ar-
rangements for the purchase of :1 1.100 acre farm
in Preston county, West Virginia, on which will be
established a demonstration project ill decentral-
ized industry for 200 families. The project calls for
the construction of modest homes with from two
10 four acres of land for each family suitable for
gardening, fruit trees, poultr raising and the pro
dilation of other foodstuffs for homo consumption,

The homes will cost about $2,000 each and will
become the property of the settlers under a 20-
year- purchase contract providing for small mouth—
ly payments, low interest charges and small down
payment.

The Settlement will be self-governing with an
administration to he patterned after the New Eng—
land town meeting plail. A school will be cstab-
lishcd alid will also serve as a community center.

Settlers will combine subsistence farming with
industrial employment. It is hoped that the plan
will insure the security of both worker and in
dustry. The administration aims to demonstrate
the fell. hility of decentralization by private cone
cer lld will includc a factory where the exact
operation of the project will be available for study.

The Sub. stcncc Homestead plan will be fi-
nanced out of a fund of 000,000 at f Me by
Congrcs Other projects are being \r01kcd out in

PARSLEY TOPS
(The Stanford Daily)

The world has advanced. Without being tied down
to specifies, that statement is probably correct. war
in the abstract is now looked upon as something hor—
rible. Only the more flamboyant of the Nazis talk
about purification by battle, the glory of the sword, and
other absurdities.

The idea’ that war is a horid thought is generally
accepted: and so collegians, too. are acquainted with
that tenet and accept it—not because the idea is wrong
or right but because we accept what is accepted, Cole
lege editors echo the acceptance and pour forth 11 pe-
rennia] wave of palaver on the horror, brutality, insan.
ity of war. No one disagrees with them; everyone
agrees that they are noble people, noble indeed.

But then these editors, noble men all. look about
and see the ROTC. That sets them off. war is ltorv
rible; that is agreed. ROTC has something to do with
war. The cranial contact is made. The editors are off
to their typewriters. From the streets of Troy to the
plains of Minnesota, pour forth the virulent inveetives
against those war-breeding horrors, the ROTC units,

The campaign jumps from an accurate major pre»
mise (war is wrong), through a ridiculous minor pre-
mist (ROTC breeds wart, to a preposterous Conclusioll~
ROTC be damned,

It is true that students in an ROTC unit learn a
few fundamentals of military activity. But it is very
difficult to say that because a student knows into how
many small hits a shell will blow him, he is just strain-
mg to get out and start a war so that he can prove
what he has learned.

Actually. it has the reverse effect. it is the em
citod volunteer that jump: up and down with glee on
the departing dock. A military student who has
combed and brushed a brace of sweating army plugs
realizes in a small way at least that war is not so many
gorgeous Y. W. c. A. attendants w1t11 lips very red and
very puckered Of course, it sounds a bit humorous to
mention veteran and ROTC student in the same breath;
but the point that the reported glory of war is some

-what deflated by a little military training is true never-

theless,

Of course, to compel military training is a justifi—
able complaint. To force people to drill is to make
bellowing complainers out of them, It ruins the spirit
of an ROTC unit and makes hopeless drudgery out of
the war. The more intelligent military men realize that.

That these editors want to stop war is praisewor-
thy. But to stop war, we must blast out: the causes,
not the manifestations. You can cut parsley tops for-
ever but the roots are still there. Jingoism, misinfor—
mation, ridiculous treaties—let these be spiked. But:
for editors, with pens couched, to fire full blast at
parsley tops like the ROTC goes Don Quixote one bet-
ter.

THE END OF THE JAZZ AGE
(L05 Angeies Collegian)

The era of “flaming youth" is definitely gone. A
radical and welcoming change has taken place, during.
the last three or four years, in the men and women of
college age in America. Whereas recently the collegian
who knew where he was going and what he wanted
was the exception, today nearly all have a driving pur
pose and a recognized air. Only yesterday the man who
could make the most brilliant “wise cracks,” who spent
money most readily and lavishly, who was, in short, the
typical “Joe College," was the ideal of college men. To-
day achievoment is the ideal. and he who excels in
scholarship and in leadership is the character for emu-
lotion.

It is not unreasonable to lay this to what has re-
ceived so much adverse publicity and asserted blame—
the depression. The depression has been crammed down
the throat of everyone able to read a newspaper or un-
derstand a present-day conversation. Everyone, irre-
spective of age, has had it borne in upon him that life
isn’t altogether one grand bowl of cherries. All of which
is a good thing, an excellent thing, perhaps not for the
peacc of mind of the individual, but for the welfare of
the nation as a whole, This depression, through its gru-
eling process. has collected and concentrated the scat
tered brains o[ yesterdays youth, and, though incapable
of peopling the world with Utopian young men and wo—
men, it has created a generation which can think as
straight as any other and can see as clearly.

Other Opinions

Editor, The Scarlet and Black:
Dear Sir:

Three days ago the Des Moines As-
sociation of Alumni met at on in-
formal dinner, followed by an infor-
mal discussion which brought forth
a true feeling of former Grinnellinns
in regard to the present status of the
school throughout the state.

Thoroughly inconsistent with the
disgusting practice of blaming the
football coach for a disastrous so.-
son that now prevails in American
colleges and universities, the Des
Moiiics group expressed its whole-
liearteo approval of Coach Watt, and
wish to extend to him a vote of confi~
deuce.

Instead of criticism of the Watt
system, former Crinnell athletes who
had served under him praised it
highly, But there was disapproval of
the administration's policy of ignorr
ing the real importance of athletics
in general,

Athletics at Crinncll are under
estimated, not ovoremphasizcd. Suc-
cessful teams are the financial back
bone of the school, and if Crinnell is
to continue in operation in the face
of its mounting deficit, there must
be more concentrated effort on the
part of the public relations depart-

ment to bring in good high school
athletes. .

Alumni here in Des Moines do not
advocate the outright purchase of
tramp athletes, but they do favor ere
tre grants of aid to those high school
men who give promise of develop-
ment. Young men of good character
are not too scarce. This type of men
should be contacted, for scholarship
alone cannot build character, nor can
football. ’

A large number of scholarships are
granted each year anyhow, so it is
suggested by the association that
part of the aid go to outstanding atti-
letes of sound character. who will go
far to regain Grinncll‘s fading reputa-
tion.

The D . Moines Alumni associa-
tion is not an organization. It be nol
oificers. It. is merely an associoi-oii,
and its hope is to escape the term
“meddling alumni.” The group, the
largest of its kind, is for Grinnell,
first, last, and all the time. It wants
to cooperate with the college admin
istration. It. does not seek to arouse
antagonism. Its thinking is rairly
