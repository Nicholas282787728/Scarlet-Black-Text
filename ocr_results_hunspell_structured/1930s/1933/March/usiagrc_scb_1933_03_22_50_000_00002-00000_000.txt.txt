NEXT YEAR’S PIONEER PRU'DITIES

Agitation for the Pioneer Pruditics, allrcollege
revue, was begun too late this year for the pro-
duction to find a place on the college calendar.
For several weeks there has been no mention of
the project. Previous to that time, a vote taken
in the women’s quadrangle turned down the pro-
duction for this year alld a committee was selected
to interview the dramatic'couucil, although as yet
zi meeting has not been arranged.

Therefore, it is safe to say that the Prudities
have been definitely dropped so far as this spring
is concerned. BUTgthel‘e is no reason to think
that the project has been dropped in regard to
next year.

Now is the time to make plans for next year’s
production of the Pioneer Prudities. A place on
next year’s calendar, and rules and regulations for
the various acts can more easily be planned at this
time than next fall or next winter. "“70 believe that
the dramatic council is in favor of rev' illg the
I’rnditics next year, providing tllat enough student
Interest is displayed to make the project \l'Ol‘I’lir
while. We also believe that this student interest
is present.

In the years that the Pioneer Pruditics were

presented at Grillncll. the rcvlle constituted the
most popular dramatic production of the season.
Not only the elements of the contest between the
various halls and cottages for pri but the gen
eral appeal of a production iil u \lCIl nearl ' the

to display talell . hot so of roqull'muellts for
practical stage work which drama students must

to light, both on the stage and in writing the manu-
scripts.

The attempt to revive the Pruditics last year
failed and that attempt has been used as all arglr

lnent against any further revival. \Vc admit that

TOO MUCH

Last week the students of Grillnell college were
given a two day rest period with a twofold pur-
pose. The first was to get under control the flu
epidemic that had attacked the campus. The Second
was to give the tired student a chance to rest and
thus strengthen his resistance to the disease.

While the rest period served its purpose at the
time, it seems to us that some of the professors are
defeating their own ends ill all attempt to cover all
the work that should be covered before spring var
cation. The professor who assigns review work, ads
vunce work, and library work will not receive the
coop ation that :i professor will who takes into
consideration the student’s other courses and the
amount of time that he has to spend on each course.

The professor who gives the cllérmolls assignr
limits will do one of two things Either he will (Ice
feat the good accomplished by the rest period by
making his pupils overwork in an attempt to get
the assignment; or he will defeat his own and by
d‘ couraging the student before he starts. and the
assignment will not even be attempted.

The students understand that it is necessary
to have mid-semester examinations ill order to
evaluatcﬂle work that has been done and the pro-
gress made. They also understand that the work
lost on Tuesday and \Vcdilcsdaii must be covered.

Howevar, the advance work would be covered
more carefully and thoroughly if put off until af-
ter spring- vacation when study for mid-semester
examinations will not be ill progl

Harvard Professor Claims

Business Will Recover
Gradually

“The lnisinoss world of the next.
generation is going to demand more
thoroughly trained men than ever
before." declared c. o. Rilg‘gles, pr
{0:501 in the graduate school of bu
ness administration sit Harvard um-
versity, here Tuesday morning.

Holding a. series of conferences in
12 of the major universities through-
out the country with men who have
applied for entrance to the Harvard
graduate school of business adminis-
tration, Professor Ruggles spent the
first of this week discussing educa-
tional opportunities with Grlnuell
students.

“Business Needs Perspective"

"Although many of the so-ealled
selfrmade men have achieved success
in business,” he continued, “It is
quite evident that college-bred men
and women have a greater relative
advantage. People are now beginning
to realize that business must be
handled by men with perspeetive."

Mr. Buggies also stated that the
optimistic reeling which is now being
manifested throughout the country.
and the apparent support whieh
President Roosevelt is receiving may
lead to a. gradual business recovery,
but not, however, until the inter-

“When husiness does pick up. a
great many corporations and busi—
ness concerns, which have been
forced to discontinue the plan of
sending representati es to interview
oollege‘seniors- on their qualiﬁcations
for employment, may revive thi‘s

Buggies.

Postgraduate work has definite ad-
vantages, according to Professor
Ruggles. Although a strident may
specialize along a eert in line he
must also be a specialist in inter
relationships That is, he must have
a lsroad training and a "telescopic
View." Commenting on -Harvarrrs
system for admitting graduate stu-
dents. lie stated that the only require-
ment is a college degree which must
necessarily include a full knowledge
of economies and English.
