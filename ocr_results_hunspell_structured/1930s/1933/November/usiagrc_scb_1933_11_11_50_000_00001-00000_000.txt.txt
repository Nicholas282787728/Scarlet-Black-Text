by Mme. Vallin

By H. w. Matlock

French musicians stand on an ems

to penetration into the deeper beau-
ties of their art Madame Ninon
Vrlllil-l, who, with the artistic collab-
oration of M. J. B. Bcaudct, of Quo-
bec, at the piano, gave the opening
number of this year's recital course
last night, is a perfect representative
of the French school

Her program, of French and Spanr
ish songs except for the famous Ital:
ian aria “Casta Diva" and two old
English ballads with exotic modem
accompaniments, was proof of the
dcpth and authority of her musicians
ship These songs which are so lucid
when she sings them. even in their
foreign tongues, would be for the
most part incomprehensible ‘to most
or the concert singers whose names
are well-known. Only prolonged study
and the French genius for introspec-
tion could make them sparkle Even
that would hardly be cnough without
the French genius for taste and style
which is one of Mme. vallin's talents.

Her voice is lovely and rich, and
her interpretations ncvcr for an m-
stant deviate from the classic sense
of proportion and balance, even when
most impassioned, that have been a
part of French virtuosity since its
inception Unlike the Italians, the

ranch singers never shriek or shout,
and unlikc the Germans, they never
growl.

They are always singing, with me-

sas, wherc his non-victorious Pioneers
wrll attempt to win the first game of
the season from the Haskell Indian
team this after-noon

The starting lineup is still a n’lyS'
tery The varsity seems to be in ex:
celleiit condition, with the exception
of Abe Rosenbloom, who has an inn
jllred nerve in his shoulder This
means that the guards will probably
be Sutton and Safri-s, with the addi-
tional pos ' ty that Captain Gould
will be shifted to a guard post, and
Sutton piit at the lattcr's old place
in the tackle position. Bernard Trulnr
bull has been giving a good exhibi-
tion at the pivot position all week,
and on the basis of this and his work
in recent games, there is a possibility
he may take Meeter’s place at cen-
ter.

Clark Shows Up Well

There is also a great deal of compe-
tition in the backfield, especially for
the halfback places, with Bradley,

thought fair to the men to sign for
games with such limited practices.

Several promising players have
been revealed by the sparse season.
Among the linemen who have done
exceptionally good work are Graves.
Boardman, Fowler, Neely, and Ross-
man. Wcst, Reeser, Arcus and Lewis
have played a good brand of foota
ball in the backfield, “The season has
been too short and irregular to really
Judge all the men," stated Truesdale.
