GRIN‘NELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1933.

NUMBER 20

 

Student Government Defined

Prudities Vote
Divided 3 to 3

in Quadrangle

Maall‘s, Twio, Five, Favor

Revival of Production;
Others Opposed

Women of the quadrangle exA
pressed themselves this week as
equally divided in approval of revlv—
ing the Pioneer Prudities, all-college
revue, next spring.

Residents of Mears, cottage Two,
and cottage Five were in favor of
the project, while women living in
Main, Cottage Three and Cottage
Four voted against the revue.

Meeting Postponed

The Women's Self Government
league was to consider the polls in
the various cottages at its regular
meeting Monday evening, but due to
the illness of Dorothy Thompson,
president, the meeting was post»
polled.

It was reported, however, that
Miss Thompson had unofficially cast
her vote on the negative side in or-
der to break the tie of 3 to 3, mak—
ing the league board's vote 4 to 3
against reviving the Pioneer Prudi-
ties. '

The project was first brought to
the attention of the'School, by polls
in which an overwhelming majority
endorsed the revival of the Prudities.
The dramatic council, however, in
considering the matter. asked that
each hall and cottage agree to fur-
nish $5 apiece for production ex<
penses, "not to be repaid in case the
revue was a financial failure.”

Students were not enthusiastic in
endorsing this provision, and the
Grinnell chapter of sigma Delta Chi
agreed to under-write the expenses
for the production. A majority of the
women, however, many of them vat»
ing for the third time on the project,
expressed their unfavorable reactions
this week. ‘

Results of Polls

Main's negative vote was 24 to 13:
Cottage Four’s was practically unan-
imous, according to the house chair-
man, Marian Schissel, and Cottage
Three voted no by a count of 21 to 13.

Affirmative votes in Cottage Two
and Cottage Five were almost unali'

mous, while Mears endorsed the proj-
ect earlier in the year.

\

Men residing in the dormitories
had agreed some time ago to back
the project.

Fourteen FreshmenCagers
Begin Drills Under Watt

Fourteen freshmen cagers are
working out every night in the men's
gymnasium under Lcstcr Watt, foot-
ball coach and prep basketball men-
tor. Undoubtedly some games will be
played by the first year squad, but
as yet none have been scheduled, an-

The list of squad members that
have turned out to date includes:
William Boardman, James Clynch,
Roger Culbertson, William Fowler,
John Haskell, Lauren Lewis, Orland
McKinley, William Miller, Howard
Moore, Roger Nelson, Charles Raw-

The freshman squad will probably
practice at the same time as tho vars-
ity, so that the two groups can furn-
ish opposition in Scrimmages some

TeaantoiElect
Grid Captains
for Each Tilt

Gould, McKee, Rosenbloom,
Rose to Receive Third
Football Awards.

instead of electing a captain to
lead the football team during the
1934 season, a player win he select-
ed before each game to fill this poe
sltion, it was decided last night by
the football letter men. The decision
was made at a dinner given for the
grid squad by President and Mrs. J,
S. Nollen.

Football letters won during the
past season will be awarded to 16
players and the student“ manager,
Luther Hemphill, Dec. 14, in Herrick
chapel, the athletic department an-
nounced today.

Howard ”Pekg” Gould. captain,
Bob McKee, Abe Rosenbloom, and
Al Rose will be getting their third
grid letters. Those who have earned
the “G" twice in football are Wesley
Clark, Bob Morgan, and Bob Sutton.

Harold Anderson,, Julius Bauer,
Jim Bradley, Vic Finl, Don Kingery,
Gordon Meeter, Dick Phelps, Earl
szris and Bernard Trumbull will
receive their first grid awards,

The work of Gould, McKee, Rosene
bloom and Rose will be sorely missed
by the 1934 gridiron squad, but the
Pioneers will have more than a full
team of lettermen to begin the sea-
son if all the men come back. Sev-
eral freshmen have also shown
promise in the few prep practices
this fall.

Truesdale Predicts Missouri Valley
Cagers of High Caliber This Season

Pioneers Have Best Team
in Years, But Center

Position of Concern.

“At this Stage of the Season it
looks as though we will have the best
basketball team in years," declared
Coach John C. Truesdale yesterday,
“but most of our competition will al-
so bc better, so we may not win any
more games."

Things, for oncc. do sccm to look
bright in the Grinncll sport horizon
again, for thc Squad boasts more
capable playcr than in some time,
Thc general caliber of the group is
higher, and one desirable feature is
that there are no "Star" players, ac-
cording to Truesdalc.

Builcr For _Ahc:ul

Howevcr, in looking ovcl‘ the Mis»
Souri Valley conlcrcncc Situation, it
can be sccn that all teams, with the
possible exception of Creighton, will
show improvement this year, while
Butler was So fol: above the rest or
the league last Season that its team
could be poorer and still have first
chance on the title.

If Creighton has the servlces of

 

Collin, which is unlikely, the Bluejay
school will present a very good team.
The Drake squad is improved and
Washington has a very good aggre-
gation. The Oklahoma Aggics are
said to have had two freshman
teams last year that consistently
took the varsity into camp.

So. says Trucsdalc, while Grinncll's
Valley conference prospects are bet-
ter at present, the Pioneers may still
finish in the same place.

“Sure—Fire” Center

The special problcm that faces the
Pionccr coach is to find a sure-fire
Center. Bob Morgan has thc best
jump of any man on thc squad; Dick
IPllclps, letterman, has had the most
experience at the pivot position; Jul»
ius Bftucr seems to be one of thc
best hallrllftnlllcrs, and Paul McCully
is the best shot among the tip-off
mcn, McCully is ambidextrous when
it comes to handling a basketball
and can hit the hoop with shots from
either hand,

A composite of these ccutcrs would
provide a whirlwind tip-off man who
would probably bc of all~conf9mllcc
caliber, Trllesdale bclicvcs, and the
Pioneer coach is hoping that each of
the center candidates may be sblc to
polish up his other qualities soon, so
that all will develop into dependable
men.

 

Class Swimmers
Select Captains

Class captains for the intcrclass
swimming teams have been chosen

Competition should be keen, and
spectators are sure to see a lively
meet. according to information from
the intramural board and the swim-
ming department. Shepherd and Mal-
brough are varsity lettermcn in swim-
ming, and the latter holds pool rec—
ords m thc.40 and 220-yard free style
and in the ISO-yard backstroke.

Putnam, sophomore leader in class
basketball also, won both the 40 and
loo-yard free style events in the 1932
intramural swimming meet and
placed third in the loo—yard free
style in last year’s interclass meet.

Jack Harris is reported good in
the free style events and backstroke.
Others who will be entered in the

special events.

Declaring that the American col—

the theory of democracy, but is con-
trolled by an oligai-chy of trustees,
President John Scholte Nollen, speak-
ing on "Student Government" in Her-
rick chapel yesterday morning, list-
ed the six functions of student gov-
erning bodies at Gricnell, and de’o
clared it "not impossible" that in the
future these powers might be in-

President Nollen spoke Tuesdayin

extend the Thanksgiving vacation to
four days, after students had peti—

student lender Specks

A gridiron banquet sponsored at
homecoming time by the Grinnell
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi and a
brief chapel talk Monday by Dwight
Campbell, president of the Student
Council, were also constructed about
this theme of student government.

“Government rests on responsibil-
ity and responsibility alone carries
authority," declared Campbell Mon-
day. He explained that there was
a general misconception of the pur-
pose, responsibility and authority of
the student guvemment, and that
there was no altemative but to ac-
cept the fact that it was definitely
limited,

Defines Toms

President Nollen, yesterday, began
his address with an anecdote which
urged definition of terms in any ar—
gume‘nt, and proceeded to his state-
ment that democracy was never a
theory of the American college or
university.

“The college charter rccognizes
neither the faculty nor the student
body," he declared, explaining that
powers of immediate government
are delegated to the faculty by the
trustees, and in turn, several powers
are turned over to student governing
bodies by the faculty.

Extension Depends on Work

The dormitory system at Grinnell
created the need for a certain type
of control, Nollen explained, and this
control was turned over to students
by the faculty,

“Extension of this democratic con—
trol is not impossible," the speaker
said, “but it may be incxpedient at
the present time." This extension of
