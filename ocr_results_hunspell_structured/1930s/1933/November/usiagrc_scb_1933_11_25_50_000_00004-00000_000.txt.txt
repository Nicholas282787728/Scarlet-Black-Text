We announced in the last issue
that an allerssolll'l valley football
team would be named in the next is-
sue, but after having interriewed all
of the lcttcrincn, the coaches, and
wracked our own brain, we find that
it isn‘t such an easy job after all. It
is principally because the Pioneers
did not mect three members of the
conference, Washington, Butler, and
the Oklahoma Aggles. Therefore, it
was necessary to take it for granted
that some of the publicity that was
sent out about the other schools was
authentic, and we also feel that it
would probably be quite appropriate.
if we named every member of the
Oklahoma team. Nevertheless, here
is the team:
Endsio'Leary (Creighton);
ney (Oklahoma).
Tackles—Quinn (Creighton); Mar-
ehetti (Creighton).
Guards—Brechler
(Grinuell).
Center—Holland (Creighton).
Quarterback—Weber (Oklahoma).
Halfbacksiwleland (Drake); Cor-
dan (Creighton).
Fullbackiﬂnll (Oklahoma).
Utility Back—Rose (Grinnell).

Politics even creep into athletics.
The freshmen in :17 certain building
on the campus got together, decided
on the men who should receive prep
football numerals, presented the re-
sults to Truesdale, and then were
surprised when their verdict was
turned down.

The Oklahoma Aggies' smashing of
Drake's championship hopes by
smearing Creighton last week, gives
the Cowboys an undisputed claim to
the Missouri Valley title. Tile Cow—
boys have now won the champions
ship for two consecutive years, and
boosted their winning list to five
games for the season. Now there are
rumors floating around hinting that
the Oklahoma team does not con
'sider it has enough competition in
the Valley league.
e s
We must admit that ‘the Aggies
have certainly outclassed all Competic
tion for the past two years in foot-
hall, but they will lose Hall, the
powerful fullback, who has been tear—
ing all competition apart for the
past three seasons, and without him
perhaps their team won't. do quite so
well. We hope that they can shake
off any feeling of superiority for at
least two more yearsiwlth basket-
ball and track also to consider.

Attitude on Questions
of Public Welfare

“In order to preserve the principles
of govcrnincnt we mllsL have the co-
operation of an intelligent partisan-
ship rather than tlic selfish partisan-
ship which lins grown up in present
day politics," declared William F.
Riley, Des Moines attorney, during
his lecture on the government of
Iowa which he presented in Herrick
chapel Wednesday evening.

Mr. Riley, who recently resigned
his position as executive secretary of
the interim committee appointed by
the legislature last winter to investi-
gate changes in state government,
spoke here under the auspices of the

“since Iowa relics almost wholly

few changes in its constitution during
the last 75 years to keep pace with
the rapid economic development,"
continued Mr. Riley, “and as a rce

evils men were brought here from
Washington to make a survey of our

other proposals of the Brookingsl‘
