students are all glad that the disas—

good points, and that is something
to be thankful for.

It’s easy to see why so

many women prefer

Lucky Suike. Luckies are fully packed with
long strands of choice tohabcos, round and

ﬁrm to the very tips. That means Luckies

always draw easily, always burn smoothly.

It also means no annoying loose ends to-

Cling to lips or mess

up the nice things

in a woman’s purse. And every day

more and more women are showing their
appreciation by saying uLuckies please”.
