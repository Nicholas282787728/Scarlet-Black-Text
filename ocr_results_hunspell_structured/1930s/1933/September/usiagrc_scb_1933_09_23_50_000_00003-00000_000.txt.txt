Watt Plans Drills _
for Michigan Tilt
(Continued from page 1)

more than 190 pounds, heing centered
around Buss, 205 pound right taclde.
while the line is heavy, most of the
backfield material is light and inex-
perienced. Last year when the Pio-
neers were set back 21 to 7 by the
Michigan team, several capable
scrubs were used in the game, and
despite the rumors, the opponents
for Crinncll next week are expected
to be exceptionally strong.

Wesley Clark, veteran fullback, and
Jim Bradley, luminary on the frosh
team last season, are expected to
join the squad today and in case
they can be whipped into shape in a
few days time, the backfield will be
greatly strengthened by their pres-
ence.

Possibilities Still Bright

Despite last night’s upsetsthe pos-
sibilities for a good team still seem
bright, for the Pioneers have seven
lettermen, Captain l-loward Gould,
Pete McKee, Bob Sutton, Al Rose,
Bob Morgan, Ahe Rosenbloom, and
Wesley Clark. in addition to these,
there are many members of the
f uh team from last year who have
. a great deal of improvement,
and also several sophomores who
will probably be given a chance to
play.

The most promising of these seem
to be Julius Bauer, who at the pres
ent time has an injured leg, Ed Hen-
ningsen, Don Kingery, Butch Meeter,
Dick Phelp‘s, Harold Anderson, Sam
Singer, Jim Bradley, Bernard Trum-
hull, Earl Safris, and Don Arnold.

Homecoming this year will be Nov,
ls, with Drake opposing the Pio-
neers. This year the two teams will
play a home and home affair, with

the first game being played Oct. 20,
at Des Moines.

Kolmwks Score

on Pioneers

As a result of a blocked punt late
in the fourth quarter, an aggressive
grid team from Goa college upset
Coach Lester watt’s Grinnell eleven
7 to o in the opening game of the
1933 grid season at Ward field last
night.

An unknown assailant harged in
on Henningscn, who stood on his
own 20-yard line, smearing a
quick kick, which was scooped up by
Sacarro who skipped 20 yards tor the
only touchdown of the game. Walk-
er, crack place-kicker, booted a per-
fect extra point.

Pioneers Launch Attack
Immediately after the kickoff,

Grinnell players launched a desper-
ate attack, using passes, plunges
and off-tackle sweeps, in a futile ate
tempt to put the game on even
terms. They succeeded in reaching
the 30-yard line before losing the
ball on downs. The game ended with
the procedure being repeated.

with the exception of several min—
utes late in the second quarter, the
rest of the game was played in the
middle of the field, with neither team
taking an advantage by exchange of
punts. In the second period Fiul
hobbled an attempt to catch a punt,
and the hall was recovered by Coe,
which used a lateral pass to reach
the Pioneer 3-yard line. The Red line
then held and the opponents lost the
ball on downs. Henningsen punted
to the 22—yard line and Coe started

another march which ended on the,

2-yard line.
half ended.
Several Points Promising

Despite losing the first game of
the season, several points regarding
the Grim-tell team seemed promising.
The line seemed especially strong,
resisting the wild plunges of the op-
ponents on crucial moments. Fumb-
ling was the greatest defect in the
backfield. Players interviewed after
the game felt that they had not
rounded into condition, and that,
combined with the heat, made them
listless. ~

Several men who have never seen
a great deal of action with the Pie-
neers were among the most out-
standing performers of the game.
Meeter played a hang-up game at
center on defensive, as did Rose in
the backfield, while Anderson seemed
adept at breaking up the opposing
interference. In the backfield King-

OMAHA, Nebr,—crcighton sm—
dents regard it as a good omen, but
to the caretakers of the university
campus it was just another dcad bird.

While lawtstudents were register-
ing in the Law huilding this wcek,
a bird of unknown variety attempted
to fly in a WIndDW, breaking its
neck on the pane. Creighton stir
dents, looking forward anxiously to
their team's opening football game
against the University of Kansas
Jeyhowkers on September 30, insist
the bird was a Jayhawk, although or.
nitholigists list no such creature in
their picture books.

James Bradley, 135, member of tho
yearling football team last fall and
sophomore candidate for a backfield
position on this year’s varsity once
fit, returned to Griunell from his
home at Harbor Springs, Mich, this
morning.

The yo-yo craze has hit the coast

from Washington State College
(Pullman, Wash.) and anyone who
cannot make the yoeyo climb the
string at least 573 timcs without
stopping, and do a couple of fancy
stunts besides, is considered a great
big sissy.
