Pioneer Prudities Considered

 

Michigan State
Favored Over
Pioneer Team

Grinnell Gridders Granted
Chance of Upsetting

Spartans

East Lansing, Mich, (Special)
—Scorc ot the half: Michigan
state 14, Grinnell 0.

The score at the end of the
first quarter Saturday was Grin-
rich 0, Michigan State a. With
the weather cloudy, and with a
crowd of 12,000 fans present, the
Pioneers fought the entire period
to get the ban into state terri-
tory but were unablc to get be-
yond midﬁeld. Anderson dropped
a long forward pass on State’s
25~yard line
After spending the week ironing

out some of the flaws exposed in the
Coe game last Friday, Coach Lester
Watt and Line—Coach Les Duke, left
yesterday morning by train for East
Lansing, Michigan, where the Grins
nell football team is scheduled to
play Michigan State this afternoon.

The Michigan men are considered
to have a great advantage over the
.Pioneels, both in weight and experi-
ence. However, Coach Charles H.
Bachman, Spartan mentor, lost
.several good men by graduation
last year, and has had a difficult
time in filling their places, especially
in the backfield.

Heavier Line

The opponents claim to have a line
that averages nearly 190 pounds.
while the Grinnell wall averages only
178. If the Coe game was'any indi-
cator, Grinnell is weakest on offense,
lacking the ability to gain yardage,
but with the addition of Wesley
Clark and Jim Bradley to the squad.
it seems possible that the Pioneers
will give a better exhibition,

Watt spent most of his time this
week drilling on a pass attack. while
Bachman sent his men through run»
ning plays, and drilled them on a
pass defense, winding up with a light
workout yesterday. As Grlhuell's
pass attack is not working as
smoothly as Watt desires that it
should, it is probable that both Brad-
ley and Clark will be given plenty of
opportunity to carry the ball.

Takes 21 Men

From the 21 men who were taken
on the trip, the probable starting
lineup includes Mcch and Anderson
or Phelps, ends; Gould and Morgan,
tackles; Sutton and Rosenbloom,
guards; Mectcr or Trumbull, centc .
Fini, quarterback; Clark and Brad~
ley, halfoacks; Rose, fullback. oth-
ers who were taken on the trip are:
Kingery, Hatfield, Safris, Klepfer,
Baucr, Henni , cn, McFarlln and
Glidden.

With the exception of Al Rose, all
the men on the squad were in good
condition for the game, Rose has an
injured leg, but it is improbable that
it will keep him out of the tilt.

Honor G Society Discards Policy
Demanding Sacrifice of Prep Caps

McKee llo Announce Edict
_ in Regard to Insignia

for Freshmen Soon

“Button, prep," the order which
spells anathema to the members of
the class of 1937, will be heard soon
on the Grinncll college campus, ac
cording to Robert “Pete" McKee,
president of the Men's Honor G club.

This edict, new to the class of 1937,
will usher in a new policy of the ath-
letic club, in that the prep caps will
not be burned at the end of the year
since the caps will have the numerals
’37 above the visor. They will
constitute a keepsake for those
preps who wish to preservc them as
mementocs of their first year at
Grinnell.

According to McKee, a
tive of the Honor G club
pointed in each of the six men's
buildings to supervise the wearing of
prep caps, and to report violators of
the "Button" edict. Since there will
be no burning ceremony at the end
of the year, the president of the club
plans to sponsor a program of a more
serious nature to usher the preps
into the sophomore class at the end
of the year.

The Honor G club will crusade for
a. more strict enforccmcnt of the
"No Smoking" rule on the campus,
embracing that portion of the cam-
pus from Sixth to Eighth avenue.
The area is extended to include the
west curb of Park street in front of
Recitation hall. The “no
smoking" rule applies to everyone in
college.
