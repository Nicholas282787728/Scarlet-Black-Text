during the school year, the attention
of the student body has been contin-
ually drawn towards the Congrega-
tional church.

Announcements of the substitute
pastors have been officially made
several times, actions of the pulpit
committee have been reported in the
paper, and a week ago an announce-
ment was made in the quadrangle
dining room to the effect that on the
next Sunday the Rev. Robert W,
Inglis would preach his first sermon,
and all students were urged to at»
tend. To our inexperienced palate,
this has a strong flavor of prosclyt-
ing. .
Several other churches of Grinnell
have had new pastors within the last
two years. but students were ncver
urged to attend their ﬁrst sermons:
in fact, as for as we know, not oven
a small notice of their arrival ap-
peared in The Scarlet and Black,
which has printed so many columns
about the Congregational church

It iS true that Grinnell was origi -
ally patronized and endowed by the
Congregational denomination. But
all formal relationship between the
two has been severed now. The stu-
dents of Grihneil are of all sects and

denominations. Does all this sector—
ian emphasis seem right?

Grinnell provides its students with
a ﬁne religious life, by means of the
weekly vesper hour, daily chapel per-
iods, and the activities of the Young
Women's Christian association and
the Young Men's Christian associ -
tion. All these are excellent non-
sectarian institutions, and adequate
ly provide for the spiritual life of the
students

really need the attendance of the
students, and which offer many op-
portunities for service,

Is it fair to these churches to kecp
the Congregational church so contin-
ually in the minds of the college stu-
dents, that they naturally go there
instead of to the denomination to
which they belong?

Sincerely your
Charlotte LaRuc.

It seems to us, as a consequence,
that all publicity for the churches of
Grinnell should be Carried on by the
churches themselves, and not through
the college.

From then on Grinnell never lost
the lead. At the end of the half Cor-

five minutes left to play in the last
period, the Cornell aggregation stag-
ed a rally that gained six points.

Grinnell’s defense was for the
most part effective, Cornell's
baskets coming from far out on the
floor. Cornell's greatest weakness .
was at the free throw line. Out of 14 . . jl ,

could make only three count. Grin-

Dibble basketball Teams
Split Double-Header With
Smith Monday Afternoon

With Smith and Dibble halls Split
ting a doubleheader, the intramural
basketball season reopened Monday
afternoon after a layoff over the ex-
amination period. Dibble won the A
game, 26 to 17. While Smith was vice
tor in the B game, 13 to 10 .

At the end of the ﬁrst canto in
the A game the two teams were tied
at mean, With the help of Earrara,
who was high scorer with 13 points,
Six ran up 16 counts. The best One
could do in the half was to sink three
ﬁeld goals and one free throw.

Smith took the lead in the ﬁrst
period of the B game, and held it un-
til the ﬁnal gun. Inability to hit the
basket from the free throw line
proved the downfall of the Dibblites.
They were only able to whisk two
of 11 gift tosses.
