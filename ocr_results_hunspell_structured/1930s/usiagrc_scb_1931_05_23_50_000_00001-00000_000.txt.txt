Competition Keou

Competition for the prizes. accord-

The winning play is the story of a
police reporter who works a "hunch”
to solve a murder. After obtaining
the confession, he discovers that the
murdered man has been associating
with his wife and he releases the
murderer. Winning direction was evir

“The chief aim," remarked the dean

Not a single case has gone to the

hands of the faculty administrative
committee.

One Grinnell student was removed
from his job with the college as a
result of the investigation. and an-
other lost his scholarship. Permission
of two men to have cars on the cam—
pus was revoked and two house coun-
cil members resigned from their po-
sitions under pressure of the probe.

None at Parties

The investigation was carried on,
according to Dean Beatty, not as a
result of evidence of excessive stu-
dent drinking, but more as a prevelir
tative measure. “There was no evi-
dence of the use of any liquor at any
of the three house parties last week-
end," he said,

The number of students likely to
be placed on probation as a result of
the probe has not been made public.
Action on this matter will be deferred
until ﬁnal faculty ruling concerning
the eligibility of students being dis-
ciplined, A recently passed rule pre~
venting these men from taking cam-

 

pus ofﬁces is now being revised.
