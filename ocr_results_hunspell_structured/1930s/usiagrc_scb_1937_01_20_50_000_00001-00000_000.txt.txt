Drake Cagers
Bea-t Pioneers

by 31-18 Score

Grinnell Fails to Halt
Powerful First Half
Scoring Drive

BY SCO’l’l‘Y McLEOD

A mediocre Drake basketball
team outscored a lackadasical
Grinnell five on the home floor
last night, 32-13. Lacking the
fire that has characterized their-
previous appearances befol‘evthe
home crowd, the Pioneers seemed
utterly bewildered during the first
half and allowed the Bulldogs to
pile up a commanding 21’s halts
time lead.

Retui-niiug to the floor for the
second half the Scarlet and
Black seemed to snap out or
their daze and managed to out-
score their ancient rivals 12-11
in the final period. Fred Luther,
sophomore flash who has been
out since the first game with a
shoulder injury was injected into
the lineup late in the second halt
and added much needed spark to
the Pioneer attack while he was
able to play. Although Luther's
shoulder injury prevented him
from scoring his floor play out-
shone that ot any man in the
game.

Fast Pas rig Attack

After exhibiting a snappy pass
sing attack which left Griffith,
Suter and oi-ehaugh open for
numerous shots the first half the
Bulldogs appear-ed content to
coast the second iralf. Without
red headed "Chuck" oi-ehaugh,
the blue and white Drake outfit
wouldn't have much of a ball
club, but with the classy guard
in action Drake will be a con-
stant threat to the Valley’s lead-
ing teams.
