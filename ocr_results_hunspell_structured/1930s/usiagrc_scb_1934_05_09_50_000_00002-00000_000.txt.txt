ROOM ALLOTIVFENT

Already dissatisfaction .has been expressed
over tlle method of rooln allotment recently devised
for tho dormitories by the Council of House Pres-
idents. S lit-c tlle whole system is based on dis
crinlillatioll, between collncil members alld non-
coullcil members and between the different class»
es, it seemed destined from the first ‘to arouse dis-
content.

Ill the first place, the council members were
asking for trollble when they decreed that their
nllmber sllollld have first choice of rooms. Seer
ondly, ill providing for the room drawings to be
made according- to the number of years of resi»
dcnce, all the least desirable rooms being left for
the incoming freshmen, the system smacks of frae
tcrllity lnetllodsimcthods which have alwa,
been evaded as much as possible on the Grinllcll
campus.

Ill addition to arou iug dissatisfaction alld
threatening the delllocntlc principles whivh past
indifferent-c to class distinc 'oll ha. abllshcd ill
regard to the housing of students at Griiincll= the
new allotment Scheme might hr colldclllncd _on
Still another score. Having been impressed hi the
benefits derived from the absence of a fratcrni
System at (lrinnell7 the incoming freshlllrll l ill
hardly lie impressed favor-ab] when they are
forced to live in the least dos lblc quarter ill the
halls because the uppc cl men have been shown
preference ill choice of rooms.

If tllc house pi dents are to bc shown pro
fcrcllcc, aild they are justified in requesting a dc-
grec of vollsidcration, the most scllsiblo move would
be to set aside a certain room in each hall as a
permanent l sldeuce for the succeeding council
members from that building. Thi is the tcm
which is now employed, and apparently with suc-
cess, ill the quadrangle. On the other hand, there
is no apparent reason for granting preference to
the three minor Councilors ill 08"]! hllll over other
residents of the building:

Ill the incoming freshmen, liowc\ or, the halls
are faced with a problem wllicll does not ex t ill
the cottages. Since the Ir shmou women are soc-
rcgated, they have the same opportunity to secure
a dc '-ablc room as the upper-cl stomell. Sonic
prov n should be made ill order that the new
lllcll students may have a chant-c equal to that of
the other men to secure the plcasolltcr quarters.

So long. as the policy of scattering the new
lllcll throughout the balls is continued, it seems
that the only way to be fair with them ill regard
to living quarters would he to Set aside it cor lill
number of rooms on each floor for their use cxe
clusively.

Tho lncn’s council undoubtedly meant to be
fair when it dr w 'np the new room allotment plan,
but it failed to take all the problems illto consid-
eration. While choice of roolns according to years’
residence in the hall appears fair enough for allot-
ment of rooms to members of the three, upper
classe , 't seems that the three minor coulloilors ill
each hall are given undue consideration and the
incoming freshmen are not treated with sufficient
respect,

HANDSHAKING

Haudshaking is one of the most detestable
methods a student may employ in all effort to
raise his grade. As a result, there has developed
a sort of unw tteu law which taboos intimate,
friendly relations between student and instructor.
T] s decree when originally matte may have dis-
couraged would-be "grade pullers,” but of late
the harmful effects of. such all attitude have far
offset the benefits,

The fundamental benefits to be gaillcd from
Student-faculty relationship are that in this
manner the student may profit from the advice of
an older pe . n, while at the some time the in
structors may profit by Contact with younger pere
sons. This should be one of the great advantages
of being a student at a small college, but this hell-
efit is becoming negligible due to the e rcuic
zeal used in applying the term “handshaker.”
The use of the term is being carried to such 0
ironies that ill the majority of the cas ' it is be»
ing misapplicd, and perfectly innocent intentions
are being misconstrued,

This tendency toward hasty misapplication
is, of course, ridiculous, It is not: only ridiculous
because it in' 'interprets perfectly innocent intell-
tions, but also because it does not credit the fac-
ulty with enough intelligence to detect attempts
to “handshake” them,

The professors are quite capable of detect-

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ing attempts to deceive them. and or ill a posir
tion to lllotc out fitting punishment for such at-
tempts. ‘

The whole attitude toward sowallcd “hand-
shaking” is, lhen, one which is resulting ill more
harm than good, and is one which calls for it roe
ndjustlllcnt which will allow the establishment of
closer relationship between professor and Shir
dent,

WHO CAN ENFORCE THE LAWS‘.7

Half a century has elapsed illcc Jesse James
rode through tllc counties of Missouri, untroublcd
by the constituted of cars of thc law. He was
surrvsst‘ul ill his defiance of authority bo'ausc ho
hild better 1' DEII'III . he had bettc hors s, and he
could tllilllt iaStrl- than the officials who tried to
capture him. And so tod v, John Dillinger, bold
and I‘D‘ml' lnl, armed W! h llcttcr gulls thou the
police, 1 lillb ill better cars. thinking i'llstcr, has
cludcd pursuers.

The civil’ lition that Jesse James llcngcd 50
yoals ago and the ' lti0ll which Dillinger la]-
10 s tnda are e lily similar in their desire to
retain all cut lilotllo( of law clll’orcclncnt. The
sllcriil. - ot'llcc, i‘l'czltod centuries ago. is unable to
cope n tll modern condition \laily states are illi-
ilblc to cstabli'h state polil-c fol-(rs because of tho
opposition of or al .Z€(llill301'\t\l\(ltlle farmers, who
hold that the purpose of a state police force is the
prott- tioil ot cat wealth. They. in less fortunate
t'ilLlII‘lISttillCi‘., do not propose to pay to protect
others. As a l'eSult of thi unfortunate lat“ of
local lauucnforccmmlt machinery it is illlp lllc
to adequately enforce criminal law.

In order to cope with the comparative oasc
and rapidity with whit-ll presellteday criminals

equally well-organized law-enforcement system.
The government must not be rcndercd powcrle

At the present time, less than one-half of one per

power of law enforcement are federal ot ers, Tile
Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Jus-

THE “EAGER” STUDENT
. (The Agnostic)

Education perfected and specialized IS scholarship.
And how long, pray, has scholarship needed a defender?
Yet the really intensive and often sineerc student, re-
ferred to as the "eager“ student, needs some defense, we
feel, and deserves some justification and tribute.

There has grown up on the campus, for no apparent
reason, an attitude of derision toward the person who
devotes nearly alt of his time, energy, and interests to
intellectual pursuits. It is almost incredible that any one
could squander golden hours poring over books and s?
rious magazines instead of going to picture shows, SI ,
ting in a drug store reading movie magazines or gossip-
ing. or taking an active part in athletics, clubs, and
other extratrcurricular activities; that one could think of
applying his efforts to work not required for, and per-
haps not closely related to hi regular assignments: even
that he should waste time in preparing well and care-
fully those assignments!

Perhaps much of our ridicule results from a more
or less carefully concealed sour-grapes attitude. Not eve
ery person possesses the ability to concentrate continu»
ously and apply himself intensively to the intangibles
and imponderablos of scholarship. We develop our per-
sonalities in other lines, less demanding and less restric-
tive, and scoff at the student of superior intellect .....

Many of us knock because it has become the thing to
do. Without pausing to realize that we are completely
unjustified in our attacks we follow mechanically a cam»
pus trend, thereby betraying our own wakness and lack
of individual thought and judgment... .

Always it is difficult to write of intangible elements
and vague subjects; usually it is pointless because it is
apt to be valuelcss. Yet scholarship. however illusive
and undefinable, is recognized as one of the finest con-
tributions of the past, one of the richest fields of ena
deavor of the present, one of the noblest adventures of
the future. Who of us is so sublimely superior that he
may scorn the student who dares to follow, whatever his
reasons, the really worthwhile calling of academic at»
tainment and intellectual advancement?

THE NUISANCE
(The Franklin)

In many of the classes that we attend, it is notice-
able that there is usually some one or two persons who
do a lot more talking than anyone else. It would not be
so bad if they had something to say but the usual con-
tribution is merely a wisercrack or pun.

We are told that all of us must pass through what is
called a "smart age,” or an age when we wish attention
and want people to laugh at what we say. It is gener-
ally conceded, however, that we pass through that ago
before we are old enough to enter college.

These individuals do for a fact get people to laugh
at some of the things they say and do. They do not real-
ize, however. that'they are laughed at because the
things they say and do are so simple that the smiles der
Velop mostly in ridicule.

it is granted that some of our classes are not so in»
tel‘esling; however, we must stop to consider that in
all probability there is someone in the class who is try-
ing to get something out of what the professor is saying.
We are not required to take the average course and if
we enter for loafing purposes only it would be much
more profitable to pick the Nook or some other hangout
where we can smoke. Remember it costs you about
seven dollars a semester for every hour you are carryr
ing and if you throw away all that you might gather
from a three hour course you toss away over twenty
dollars. It is your money but why waste the time of
others by your wiseoracks.

“Participation in and knowledge of
world and municipal affairs are ne-
cessities for a well organized socie-
ty,” claimed Shelton L. Beatty, dean
of men, in an informal address.

“When this is realized," he continur
cd, ”men will cease to spend their
lives earning money and Will seek to
be well grounded in intellectual
pursuits.”

Mr Bentty concluded with a state-
mcnt of the vices into which our pre-
sent society has fallen, due to the
ignorance, or at least the disinterest-
edness, of the people who make up
the society.
