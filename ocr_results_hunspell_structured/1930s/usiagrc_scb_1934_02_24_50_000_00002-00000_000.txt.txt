WASHINGTON AND THE LEAGUE OF
NATIONS

Hero debunkers serve :1 real purpose in
bringing down to earth those historic giants whom
mythology has placed too high above us to be felt
and understood as human beings. But we must
remember that our heroes, with all their faults,
have won the name which posterity revereutly
lays before them because of great qualities, vir-
tues too powerful and magnificent to be buried by
tho petty vices and mistakes which the debunkcr
calls to our attention. ‘One of the lnost significant
of these virtues in the make-up of gloat men is
courageous faith.

When intelligent people might have laughed
at the thought of an independent America, George
\Vaslllngton gave his life to build that dream in-
to reality. \Vhen the Union which \V sllillgtoll
and his fellows had created was torn in i hatred
and. bitterness, Abraham Lincoln still had faith ill
it, and he lived that faith courageously, placing
behind it every ounce of his spiritual and mental
strength.

Great men give their lives in the faith that
the cause they lire for lnay some (lay win. and
the greatest of them are those whose cause looks
darkest to the pessilnists around them. Today (hr
world seems to have given up hope in the League
of Nations, Disaster after disaster has crippled
it. Four of the largest Powers in the world are
not mambo ; two of them never welo. “Theltt
fore," cy as say, ”giie it up. ” But great men
are not built of such tender stuff. The) see that
the need is greatest when the difficulty is most
severe. They do not blow out the last ligllt when
it grows dilll, but they protect it and strengthen
it.

Those who shrug their shoulders at the
League should remember that people how. also
shrugged their shoulders at the idca of a {Tuitod

S1atrs. It was the very impossibility of \Vash-
ingtoll's task which made his sucross ‘igvlific:iiit.,
and part of Lincoln‘s greatness lay in “re [not
that he bad faith in the Union when olhrrs had
lost hope.

It a country like the Unitrd Status will sun-
gesl n l'rasiblo . .ion of the licugur, and will . \-
Iloulwc its willingness to l'-'oin under that coir
(llllOlL lht‘n a world law and :i world ortlcr may
yet be maintained. If some nation does not so
not lmpo uill indoad lrmain dim as it is admitted-
l) diln todi ' The Leaguo ol Nat

Rooslwclt to stale (hr terms on whirh the United

Washington and Lincoln. Thry will forget how
dim tho Iloliv now seems, and work with roux-ago»
ous faith in order that what llopc rot rmnaiils

deed call themselves patrio . in the highest sense
of the word If they fail, they will at least know
that they gave their best.

G_—
AROUND THE CORNER

The other morning we wore somewhat sur-
prised. upon looking- through tho newspapers, to
read the nonchalant statement that our heartr
hcdfellow of the last few years, Mr. Depression,
had left us. According to the news story. Ch- los
Gates Dawes, ex~vico president of the United
States, cx»ambassador to England and present
day big banker of Chicago, broke a two-year sil-
ence about business conditions to declare that thc
lcjountiy rounded the corner of prosperity in Octoe

er

Stating that he based his optimistic prediction
on months of study, Dawes explained that econom-
ic history shows the average length of 35 depres-
sions to have been five years and three and oile-
half months long, From this bit of statistics and the
now confidence of the American people,,\rhich he
says began when Roosevelt declared the bank hol-
iday last year, and apparently little else by way
of proof, Mr. Dawes seemingly dispels present 0007
nomio conditions with a wave of his hand, and
makes his statement of good cheer.

In the first place, this has not been on aver-
age depression—but is arkllowlctlged the most in»
clusirc the world has ever experienoodiso why
should we expect it to last only for an average
length of time as set by other economic repercus-
sions? And in view of the fact that prominent
economists, writers, cl 'men. radio speakers.
and business men are do aring that we r by no
means out of the clutch of the dam on. and
many of lhom voicing tho opinion that it will not
be ended llnlil probably 10% or 1937, one would
be inclined to call Mr. D statolnrnt a little
pvcnlntnro, if not even l‘iLl Should hr. after
all. have brolEZ‘n his two-year silence?
