The preliminaries to the Merrill de-
hates were held last weekend, but
no decision was rendered. Represent-
ing Kelly was Freddie Van Druff,
while Bennett and Frye ably upheld
Clark’s laurels. Indeed the argument
becaiue rnther heated on occasions,
particularly those references to rid-
ing boots. When all is said and done,
cheerleaders and varsity tickets are
rather trivial issues to argue about
when you consider such things as

piano playing.

tween the top step and King's arms.
The locale of this tender little
scene was the rehearsal of the
homecoming play. A car belonging
to one of the younger professors
was immediately connnundeercd

tricked into her u-ee trundle bed,
tired but triumphant.

One or the main disadvantages
of a man school is the rapidity
with which a good story gets
around. There's the pathetic case
of Al Rose .who was left last week
with that story about the girl call-
ed Virginia on his hands. Perhaps
he ran into some simple soul in
West Liberty or St. Louis.

Horton has a hard time getting his
hat on these days when he thinks of
his faded summer love calling him
up all the way from St. Louis to
find out why he wasn't writing.
Whether the ESL. believes Horton
or not, She'll know he gave her a
good ten dollar explanation when she

gets her telephone hill.

Jack got nothing but very cold

that’s something to philosophize

Cottage Associates Decide
Against Independent Sports

At a special meeting for town wo-
men Wednesday evening, discussion
was held as to the advisability of
holding intramural sports independ-
ent of cottages. After much dis-
cussion, the women voted to abandon
the idea, because they felt that it
would make for too marked a divis-
ion between quadrangle and town
residents.

According to Mary Wood, president
of the League of Town Women, on-
nouncement will be made next week
of the cottage affiliations of the town
associates.

Work has begun at the University
of California, at Berkeley, on a new
cross-country course which is being
designed to afford a complete view
of the race by both judges and spec-
tators.

The University of New Hamp-
shire's winter sports team buys its
own equipment and pays its own
transportation, and is still a leader
among eastern institutions.

Billikens Victor's _
in Close Contest

blocked Arenz' attempted kick. Aii-
other touchdown march placed Hur-
ley in position to charge over his
right tackle from the 22-yard line for
the winning marker. Phelps blocked
Arenz' attempted kick this time.
Rose Smears 'Em
, Grinnell's feature of the game was
the fine tackling by Rose. During the
first quarter Grinncll showed amaz-
ing strength both on defense and of-
fense so that the St. Louis backfield
men were kept on the go all the
time. The first touchdown came in
the second period after a sustained
60-yard drive featured by Clark and
Full. The menacing zoo-pound hacks
of St. Louis, Bapp and Arcnz, were
coldly shut off from gain.

St. Louis came back and crashed
the iron-wall defense of Grinuell, con.
tinuing for 60 yards until its firsti
touchdown had matcrializcd.

The second half started with some-
what tight play, Henningsen made a
nice gain of 15 yards on a play
around left end. A forward pass by
Fini to Kingery which was good for
45 yards, put the ball on the St.
Louis 11-yard line. and another pass
from Kingery to Anderson was good
for the touchdown.

Pioneers Try Third Time

From the 13-yard line, the Billi-
kens made a strong march against
the game Grinnell linemen who tried
hard but without much avail. Hur-
ley put through a pass to Arenz for
a 20-yard gain as the third quarter
ended.

After the two touchdown drives by,
st. Louis in the fourth canto, Orin-
nell broke loose with what looked
like a third scoring march. Fini
threw a long pass for 30 yards to
Rose after which Bauer crashed
through the right side of the St. Lou-
is line twrce for a gain of 27 yards.

Although Kane intercepted Clark's
pass, the Pioneers were not through.
for the Billikens soon kicked and
iGrinhell’S dying effort was a 45-yard
pass from Bauer which missed Mc-
Kee‘s outstretched hands by a few
inches. The game ended as Arenz
and Hurley were making good gains.

Attendance at the game was esti-
mated as 5,500 fans. Grinnell aver-
aged 42 yards on its punts and St.
Louis 39 yards. The Pioneers made
384 yards to the Billiken‘s’ 410 yards.
Four Pioneer passes were completed

Bulldogs Rated Among

East in Valley
The Crinneil college football team
will still be fighting for the first vic-
tory of the season when it meets
the Drake university eleven on the
Bulldog stadium next Fil'day night.
Since their upset victory over the
fast moving Creighton team last
night, the Bulldogs have proved
themselves to be one of the most for-
midable teams in the Missouri Val-
ley conference. The game Friday will
not only be the first conference game
of the season for Grinnell, but it will
also be the first of a home and home
arrangementhetween the two schools.
Reports of the Creighton-Drake
game give the Bluejays a decided
edge despite the defeat, and yet the
Bulldogs took advantage of a per-
fect pass situation to make the only
touchdown of the game, Earlier in
the season the Drake eleven made a
good showing against the University
of Illinois team, and since then has
won two games. Creighton played a
deadlock with Haskell Indians.
Drake boasts of 14 letterrnen, and
several capable men from its fresh-
