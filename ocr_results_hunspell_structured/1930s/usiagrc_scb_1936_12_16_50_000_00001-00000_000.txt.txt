that it was generally understood
that one did not leave a girl
standing in the middle of the
floor after a dance."

Mon Not Surprised

He continued by saying that
the men were not surprised that
they surpassed the womeir in the
test. “One: has only to eat in
both dinnigrl'ooms to find out
how much noisier the quadrangle
is."

The twelve sections in the test
were: Living with others, Meet-
ing People, Pen in Hand, Accepts
ing with Pleasure, When Meals
time Comes, Dating, Dancing, Ins
vitcd Out, In the Public Eye, Gor
ing Places, Staying Awhile, and

Anxious to avenge their defeat
at the hands of Coe college cagers
here last Saturday, the Pioneers
will invade Cedar Rapids for a re-
turn engagement on the Kohawk
court Friday night.

Due to the fact that both sides
were short on reserves last Satur-
day a regulation game was played
instead of the experimental con-
test of three lsrminute periods
that was originally scheduled. In
all probability a regulation game
will be played at cedar Rapids.

Grinnell’s big problem Saturday
night will be to set an organized
defense to stop Kammel' and Mc-
Kinley, Kohawk scoring threats,
according to Head Coach Trues-
dale. Lack of organization last
week allowed the Coe team to pile
up a big lead in the first half that
the Pioneers were unable to over-
come.

Pioneer hopes were given a big
boost this iveck when it became
known that Wilbur Luick will
probably be available to the team
after the Christmas holidays.
Luick, giant center. who dr pped
basketball because of ineligi llity,
will report again as soon as he
makes up a deficiency in French.
