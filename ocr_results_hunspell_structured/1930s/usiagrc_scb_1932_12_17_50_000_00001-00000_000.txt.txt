Golf Dues Discussed

Mr. Burton discussed with the
council, the matter of getting cheap-
er rates for students at the Grinnell
Country club next spring and sug-
gested that a. committee from the
council interview the Country club

One of the matters discussed by the
council was that of ordering fresh—
men to take showers on afternoons
of date nights instead of waiting un-
til after dinner. If this were done, it
was pointed out, all of the hot water
would not be used at once and it
would make for better shower condir
tions early in the evening.

arrange for the speaker and enter—
tainment, at the Christmas program

focusing their attention on coming
vacation events but many have paus—

Christmas to them.

To Professor 0. 1r. Lovell Christ—

key and duck and plum pudding when
there were 15 of us at the table, pre-
ceded by a Christmas tree and by u
Christmas service at church, and
followed by a toboggan party or a
sleigh drive or a snow shoe tramp.
Them was the days."

“There are two traditions in our
Christmas celebrations,” said Profes~
sor .l. D. Stoops. "One is the old pag-
an tradition, celebrating the rebirth
of the year.'The other tradition came

from the birth of Jesus and centers
in the idea of good-will and brothel”
liness. Each of these elements is as
real to me as the other."

Kathryn Heywood, president of the
League Board, givcs her interpreta-
tion of the meaning of the event by
saying, “Christmas is a festival day
in memory at the birth of Christ. AH
this time we pay our greatest tributeI
to him by giving joy and happiness
to others."

“This year more than ever before
I think,” states Grant 0. Gale, assl
sistant professor of physics, "Christ
mas should take on its original mean-
ing, that of service, good-will, and
peace toward all, rather than the
usual material expression."

”All Christmas means to me is an
other bag of sticks because I am al
ways a had little boy,” says Richard
Ullrich,

The petition was presented by
Mary Kout, Cottage Five house
chairman, at a meeting of the Grin-
nell college board of trustees Thu
day.

The Right Rev. Hal v St Longlev

trustees for the first time Thursday.

Bishop Longley was elected to the
board last June, in connection with
the formal action of thc Episcopal
convention of Iowa creating a rela-
tion of Episcopal churches to Grinnell
college. This is similar to the con-
nection the church has with Caries

in Nebraska.

DuncanNets
Ten Points

in Last Half

Both Teams Miss Often

in Coll-innell’s First

Home Game

By MAX ROSS
(sports Editor)

Finally coming to life late in the
second half of its game with Simp-
soil college, Coach John C. Thrue‘s»
dole-s 1932-33 Pioneer cage team
made a successful debut on the home
floor Friday afternoon, winning 24—
16.

It was not until Phelps and Mason,
the sophomore regulars, were rein-
serted about the middle of the second
half that the Grinnell team at last
began functioning.

Game Sluggish

The game was sluggish from the
start, with Phelps and Santi dropping
in neat baskets for the opening 4-0
lead that the Pioneers secured, only
to have it wiped out by a Simpson
drive that netted seven points and
gave them a 7-5 advantage at half
time.

With Parzyhok and Santi at for.
wards, Duncan at center. and Menus
and Dumb at guards, the scarlet and
black outfit looked better at the
start of the last half than it did at
the beginning of the game with Ma-
son and Phelps in the places of
Manns and Parzyhok. This combinar
tion did not get resulm, however, and
on the first play after Phelps went
in, the Pioneers worked a perfectly
executed tipoff formation.

Duncan Outstanding

The outstanding man on the floor
was Captain Duncan of Grinnell, who
played a whirlwind game in the sec-
ond half, dropping in four southpaw
hook shots from unseemly angles and
counting twice from the charity lone.

It remained for Gaston Santi,
Coach Truesdalc's "find" of the sea—
son, to turn in the best performance
as for as floor work was concerned.
The alert Coloradau played an ex-
pert defensivc game, covering his
men well, and at the same time was
an integral part of the Grinnell of-
fcnse, whether he was at a guard or
forward position.

Mason Gets Three Fouls

Mason had three personal fouls
called on him in the first ten min-
utes, and Coach Trucsdale wisely re»
moved him until later in the next
half. For Simpson, Liddlcont, Thomp»
son and Wells played best, Liddlcoat
leading the Methodist scoring with
three field goals.

Duncan scored 10 points for the
winners, while Ullrich counted five
and Phelps four points. Mason was
the only man to have more than one
personal foul called upon him.

Explain New Rules

Before the game Truesdale explain-
ed the new rules to the crowd, using
two complete teams composed of
Pioneer reserves.
