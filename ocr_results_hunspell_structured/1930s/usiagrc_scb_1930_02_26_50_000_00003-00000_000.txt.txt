The column a] pure Bunny.

Having read both Ripley's "Be-
lieve It Or Not" and ‘Judge's', “Don’t
You Believe It", that well known re-
search worker, Prof. Meyers, has de-
ﬁnitely announced that Rip’s book is
a shade the better.

His yarn, however, about the dim-
inutive cow that gave condensed

_ milk, was a. little too much—Believe

it or not:

Miss Eleano'r Johnson begs to state
that although the cooper school fire
escape is still a wee bit dampish (see
Doric ﬁles), the stadium is practical—
1y dry.

Which reminds us that that ex—
tremely modest and shy youngster,
Charles “"MIE Woody, has just
heralded in the spring by the pur
chase of a Ford, which he says will
make his “plenlcs” bigger and better
than ever. Adv.

Of course it’s been a long time, but
we were just wondering, if our husky
friend, Sue Rockefellow, can recall
the time _she went on a picnic and
forgot the food?

Chapel may he changed but, we're
wining to wager a couple at rubles,
that the “voice of the student" is
still crying for 10 o’clock chapel:

It you don't believe it, ask Mrs.

McAllisler!

We understand that the sylpb.
like Klemme has gone on a diet. For

eighteen days, he intends to refuse ..

the fourth helplng!

Which may not he as hard as it
seems! .

l STOCK TIP:

Watch for STEWART-FEE Alr-
por-t Stock on the New York stock
Exchange. Mr. Fee, noted stock
dabbler, says that he and his associ-
ate, Mr. Joel' Stewart, famous dare-
devil aviator, will soon incorporate
with an initial capital of 525,000,
and will let a few shares of stock go
at either $25 or $50. (To be decid-
ed at the next meeting of the Board
of Directors, at White Spot. Don't
crowd, the line forms on the right).
A free lesson in the handling of air-
planes, of which the company will
have a goodly supply, will be given
’ with each share of stock sold.

Whether or not “Bunny” will fur-
ther his impersonation of our own
Gary, by taking Peggee sky riding,
as she warbles the theme song, is
still a matter of conjecture.

A certain young lady, one of the
B.B.D. (beautiful but dumb) variety
in Mears overheard that a student
chapel poll was being taken. "Why,”
she exclaimed, “I didn’t know there
_was a pole on the chapel; and what
do the boys want of it anyway?" Our
advice to you, 3.131)., is to read the
Scarlet and Black.

It Seems that Blanchs Hulsebus
engaged in a girlish game of hide
and seek with one of her professors
the other evening, first she and then
the worthy pedagogue chanting that
popular ditty: "I'm Following You."
The same authority also states that
Miss Hulsehus concluded the one-act
play by sobbing: ‘Molulln’ Low."
Callers will be received at Cottage
Three tonight to receive the aston-
ishing details.

Water Polo Lead 1
is Taken by Smith‘

The Smith hall intellectuals, of1
tar playing the goat in intramural
basketball, turned the tables in wat-
el' polo Tuesday afternoon when
they swept into the lead of the league
by downing Dibble in a bitter con-
test by a 3-0 count. “'

The winners fought desperately
and took advantage of the breaks to
get their victory, scoring one free
throw in the first half and two in the
second. They missed many oppor-
tunities to raise their score by gift
shots, however. Adams, Grounds
and Taylor were among the Smith
stars and Norton played a strong
part in the victory. Risser, Dan-
forth and Lambie also saw action in
Lhe contest. Miller, Graflund, Ed-
Weld, DeWindL, Tatum, Soeshe, Rina-
fort and Heldrldge worked for DH?—
ble.

The Kelly Stables sextet lost arr
other contest yesterday, dropping the
game with Building Four by a 13 to
5 score. The winners took a big
lead in the first half with a pair of
touch goals. Klemme, conn‘or, Fee,
McCoy, Allison, Arnold, Barnum and
Grates sow action for the stables,
and Bradford, Shroer, Sweeney,
Snead, Brcdine, Wiley, Cofeie and
Henson worked for the winners.

In the opening game last Satur—
day, Smith showed possibilities of
championship caliber hy downing
Clark 11-4. The same men played

ed to Langan in their scheduled
game Saturday, and Dibble' defeated

Debaters Win
in Drake Dual

Audience Decision at Ad
Club Gives Margin

to Grinnell.

Grinnell added another victory to
her list of wins over Drake during
the past week when the Pioneer de-
bate squad won an audience decision
over the Drake debaters yesterday
noon at the Des Moines advertising
club meeting held in Younker's tea
room. The votes cast by members
of the club gave Grinnell the decision
40-23.

Two speakers from each squad
gave eight minute constructive and
three minute rebuttal speeches. John
5110de and Edward Spencer upheld
the affirmative of the advertising
question for Grinnell, and Edgar Wil—
son and Richard Moody, two of
Drake's leading debaters, maintain-
ed the negative. The question was:

"Resolved that advertising as prac-

ticed in the United States today is
harmful rather than beneﬁcial to so-
ciety.”

The affirmative based its argu-
ment on the fact- that present day
advertising methods are being abusA
ed, and that advertising is much ex-
aggerated. Both Spencer and Snod-
dy presented strong arguments in
powerful style to receive applause
from their audience.

The negative based its arguments
on the points that advertising
makes possible large scale produc-
tion, that it is educational, and that
it has stabiliized business.

Pioneer Freshmen

Play Drake Friday

A new freshman lineup may greet
the eyes of Grinnell fans when the
youthful Pioneers play the Drake
Bullplips here next Friday night in
their only home cage contest of the
season. since the loss of Duncan,
Coach L. L. Watt has been using
Straley at center, but he will prob
ably shift him to guard next Friday
and pull Dick Ullrich to the pivot
past. He plans to start his usual
men, however, with James and Wolf-
inger at forwards, Ullrich at center
and Straley and Robinson at the
guards.

The yearlings ran wild against the
Cornell preps last Saturday and rate
ed a 26 to 16 victory. The first half
of the contest was fairly close with
both outfits showing some tight der
fensive play, but the Pioneer youngst-
ers pulled to a 13 to 9 lead near the
end of the period. The second half
saw mlrich playing circles around
the Purple hopefuls and he counted
up a total of 13 points individually.
