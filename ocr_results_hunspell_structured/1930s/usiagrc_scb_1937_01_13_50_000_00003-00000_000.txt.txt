Stoddard Lane Predicts
Hopeful Life for Man

in Orientation Lecture

Lite is full of hope tor man it'
he knows he is not alone in a
hostile universe, but that God is
lworking with him, Dr, Stoddard
Lane, pastor of the Plymouth
Congregational Church of Des
Moines told the joint meeting of
the orientation classes Tuesday
morning.

“The universe is not to be lg”
nored in estimating man's digs
nity," Dr. Lane declared, “and
therein the huinanists make their
mistake when they contend that
man is supreme and aloof."

Pointing out that there are cars
tain laws of the universe over
which man has no control, and
which he must obey or suffer,
Dr. Lane attempted to show God
as a power greater than man,
that is making for ultimate
righteousness. In the physical

ergy or lite, he only discovers
and uses them. "In the moral
universe, the fundamental law,"
declared Dr, Lane, “is the wages
of sin is death." ‘

Library Finds
Students Prefer
Lonely Book

Are Griiinell students lonely,
and are the women planning bus»
iness rather than home Careers?
These are questions being asked
by the library stair upon discov-
ering that “Live Alone and Like
it" seems the most popular book
on the rental shelf at present. This
book, written by Marjorie Hillis,
was checked out seven times dur»
ing December.

a further survey of books bor-
rowed from the rental library
shows that Crinnellians are partial
to mystery stories, with two books
by Wodehouse, “Laughing Gas"
and “Young Man in Spats" circus
latiiig frequently. Another popu-
lar book of this type is Walhng's
“The Corpse with the Dirty Face."

Among the novels, Hobart's
“Yang and Yin” and Thomas‘ ”The
Home Place" are being read con-
stantly, each book having been
checked out tivc times during De-
cember. Two other books in con—
tinual demand are Huxley’s "Eye—
less in Gaza" and Mitchell's “Gone
with the Wind.” The last-mane
