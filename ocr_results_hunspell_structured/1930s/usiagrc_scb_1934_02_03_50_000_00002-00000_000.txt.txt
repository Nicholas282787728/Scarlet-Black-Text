It is the existence of such \

mention the addition of chess,
checkers, and perhaps bridge. if

“Salad Courses" Missing

From Entertainment

(By H. \v, MATLACK)

Few programs have ever been giv—
cn in Gl‘lnnell which were so solid in
their substance as that offered by
the Paris quintet last Wednesday
evening. This quintet, a. unique enr
semble of flute, string, and inn-p, is
made up of artists of high attain—
ment, who have been playing togeth-
or for eleven years, and who have he—
come zealots m the cause of their uur
usual combination of instruments.

Their performance of the older
masters, Couperin and Mozart, was
charming, and when they jumped in-
to the twentieth century they offer—
ed Works of considerable magnitude
by Pieme, Debussy, Jongen, and
Gretchaninoff in a tremendously ex»
citing manner, slimuinting even to
the point of exhaustion, for there
were no salad courses between the
big numbers.

Interpret Com-ﬂy Music

The old dances by Couperin which
opened the concerts are perfect mus»
ie for the violin, Violoncello, and harp.
Their three exponents, MM. Rene
Bits, Roger Boulme, and Pierre Ja-
met, gave a perfect demonstration of
the courtly music of 200 years ago,
but with s set of instruments and a
degree of style which would have daz—
zled Couperin and his contemporar»
ies. in the quartet by Mozart the
flutist M. Rene Le Roy, and M,
Pierre Grout, who played the viola,
joined the violin and cello in a, fluent
and at times exceedingly rapid poi»
trayal of Mozart. in his gnyer moi
ments.

The plunge into the twentieth cenr
tllry was sudden and overwhelming
First came a. magnificent set. of var-
iations closing with a finale, by the
gifted Frenchman Gabriel Pie
then some characteristic pieces call-
ed a sonata, by Debussy. This was
followed by a quintet written for and
dedicated to those players by M.
Jongen, bend of the conservatory at
Bmssells, and as an encore the quin-
tet returned and played a long and
top-heavy selection by Gretchnniuoff.

Pioneer Swimmers Lose
to Gustavus Adolphus

Dave Malbrough, Pioneer bae -
stroke and free style artist, was 1'
,spannble for both Gl'illnell fu-
pldccs Wednesday as the swimming
team lost to Gustavus Adolphus 53
to 22 in its first meet of the present
season.

Grinnell was unable to rate better
than a third place in any event up to
the time of the 100»yard backstroke,
which Mnlbmugh won by a decisive
margin in 1 minute 85 seconds.
Later, Malbl-ough came through with
an even more decisive win in the
220-yard free style event, being timed
at 2:453. The highly touted Gabriel-
sen brothels contributed the greater
part of the northerners’ total, will-
ning three first and three second
places among them.

The Pioneer natulors will engage
in their second meet of the season
next Friday when they compete
against Iowa State at Amos. Meets
with Carleton, Feb. 23 and Nebraska,
March 3, will complete the 1934
schedule.
