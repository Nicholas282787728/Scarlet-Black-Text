“EAT and be merry” is a

fine idea, but to do it
right you should know your
meat. And the place to get
meat is at BARCLAY MAR-
KET. How about a hot,
iuicy, dripping, steak put be-
tween buttered fresh bread?
Doesn’t that make your
nouth water? On your next
picnic have steaks, and have
the best picnic ever.
