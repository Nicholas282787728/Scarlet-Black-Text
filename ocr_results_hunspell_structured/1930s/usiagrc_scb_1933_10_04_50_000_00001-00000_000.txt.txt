No Danger From Case
of Sleeping Sickness

Absolutely no danger of contagion
from the illness of Miss Vera Bamcs,
member of the college library staff,
who is confined in a local hospital
with sleeping sickness, has been ex-
pressed by Dr. Walter L. Bierr—ing,
Des Moines, state health commission-
er and president of the American
Medical association,

“You can assure the hospital authe
critics,” declares a letter from Dr.
Bierring to the local physician in
Charge," that there is no danger of
further spread from this one case.
Experience has shown that contact
spread is very unlikely and as long
as the ordinary precautions of isola-
tion have been carried out, the com.
munity need have no fear as regards
the danger of transmission.”

Dr. Bierring was in Grihnell Mons
day, Miss Barnes having been re—
moved to the hospital Sunday.

Nine cases of Epidemic Encephali-
tis have thus far been reported in
Iowa in 1933, according to a recent
bulletin issued by the United states
iPublic Health service. The chances
that any one individual will suffer
from the disease in an outbreak are
as one in more than 3,000.

Miss Barnes has been isolated since
contracting the disease.

Vacation Limited
to November 30

for Thanksgiving

Thanksgiving vacation will this
year be limited to the single day of
Thursday, Nov, 30, Miss Bethena Mc-
Candless, registrar, has announced.

According to Miss McCandless, the
faculty committee is endeavorlng to
ishorten the college year as much as
possible to keep down expenses. Thus.
classes began no sooner than usual
this year, while commencement will
be somewhat earlier than it was last
June. The committee intends to keep
the Christmas vacation at its cus-
tomary length. but, if it does this, it
cannot allow the students any vaca-
tion other than Thanksgiving day
proper at the end of November.

Two years ago, when the Commit
tee made a similar decision, students
were able to secure an extra day's
vacation by petition; last year, how-
ever, their effort to change the ruling
was unsuccessful.

Favor Reformed Capitalism;
First Loyalty to Family,
Second to Self

If the results of the qllestlonaire
sent by the Young Men's Christian
association to soil Grinnell students
this summer may be taken as any
criterion, the school’s attitude toward
the nation's economic system as it
exists is decidedly onc of dissatis-
[faction

The on some who have thus for re-
turned the questions wcrc unanimous
in their disapproval of the prescnt
capitalistic system, but the majority
felt that a capitalistic program of
a reformed nature should be retained.
Fifteen, however, believed that a
socialistic program should be substi-
tutcd.

Family Tics

When asked to rank their loyalties,
the response of those questioned
showed that highest regard is felt
toward the family, closely followed
by loyalty toward self. Humanity
was next in rank, with the state,
the church and business success rated
in the order given.

Maximum service to their generhn
tion was proclaimed one of the chief

dents, Thii-ty- it set the achievement
of a comfortable and enjoyable ex-
istence as one of their prime goals.
A third of the group admitted a de-
sire to attain a supreme achicvc~
merit in some special field.

General optimism in the future was
made very apparent by the fact that
58 expressed confidence in the infill-
cncc of personal idealism toward Cre—
ating a, better world. Only three sig-
nified doubt in the Capacity Bf pet‘s

dltlons.

Teachings Applicable

Forty-51x of the students expressed
belief that Jesus’ teachings can be
practically applied in modern life,
while six others granted that they
are still applicable under certain cone
dlltions. However, the majority looked
askance at any attcmpt‘ to influence
others to accept one’s personal rc-
llgious beliefs. Only eight believed
any conflict to exist between science
and religion.

disarmament showed a pacifistic
tcndency. More than two-thirds of
the group believed that the United
states should disarm in proportion as
other nations do. However, the ex-
treme militansts outnumbered the

Venerable ‘Gyl-n Caretaker

Reveals Exciting Life

on Bounding Main

“One night during that heavy
crossing from Chesapeake to Bor-
deaux, a hig‘sea hit us just after 1
had left the wheel at the end of my
watch. Believe me, if it hadn’t been
that a rail was right there handy,
I‘d have been swept over sure. I had
more than one close shave during my
years at see, but that was the clos—
est,"

And it was just that close that
Grinnell came to losing one of the
,most familiar figures on the college
’campus. The old salt under consid—
station is none other than "Dad"
Richardson, venerable care-taker of
,the men’s gymnasium.

30-Day Battle
That “heavy Crossing" referred to
.was later revealed as a trip across
lthe Atlantic which required a 30-day
1battle with the elements before
“Dad’s" boat arrived safely at its
destination,

“We began to take in sail as soon
‘55 we left port," he recalled, “and
we kept on taking in sail all the way
across. That was some storm!

‘Dad’ Shipped Out as Cabin Boy;
Refused Second Mate’s Ranking

 

doc/N MsL‘gFFRrE-Fveesm

"No, I wasn’t an ‘able bodied see»
man‘ yet, just a cabin boy," the ex-
tar replied when asked what rating
he held at the time he assisted in
steering the ship through the storm.
In reply to the query of whether it
wasnit a bit out of the order of
things for a cabin boy to be at the
wheel, “Dad" sniffed in disgust.

, _“Notlling To It’ﬂ

"There’s nothing to steering a ship.
If you can read a compass you can
guide a ship. Besides,” he explained,
"there were only eight of us in the
crew, so we all had to take a turn,

“I held every rating from that of
plain every day ballast to second
mate while I was at sea," hc con-
tinued, “That is,” be amended, "I
could have been second mateithe
captain offered me the job.” The of-
fer, lie said, had come from the chief
officer of the craft he was then on.
it was the same ship which had
taken the leisurely but exciting so-l
day cruise across the Atlantic,

When asked why he had refused
the post he explained that the boat
wasn't safe. "It was so rotten," he
volunteered, “you could jab a knife
blade plumb through the bulk head,
and 1 was afraid the hull might be
in the same shape."

sinoll Packages

“Dad" continued his reminiscing,
telling of many interesting exper-
iences. He recalled the time be had
talked a captain into hiring him byl
reminding the officer that "many
worth while things are wrapped in
small packages”.

Hc told of peeling "spuds", ofl
record cargoes carried, and of fishing]
on the grand banks of Newfound-
land. He never did explai , though,
why he had sailed on a ShlA as cabin
boy, blithc and carefree, but had quit
the some barqne for its unseaworthi-
ness when offered the second mate’s
post. Perhaps such matters are
simply boyond the ken of land lube
hers.

Grid Contest

Both Camps Point for First
Football Victory

of Season

The Iowa state Teachers college
eleven is expected to give the Grin-
nell college football team plenty of
competition when the two teams
meet on Ward field, here Friday
night.

Both teams will be fighting for
their first victories of the season,
with Crmnell having lost to Coe and
Michigan state, while the Teachers
lost a game to Cornell last weekend.
Several who witnessed the latter
garne state that the state Teachers
have one of the strongest teams in
the state, lacking only in experience.

Baker Couch

Johnny Baker, all-American guard
from Southern California, is head
coach at the Cedar Falls school, and
with the installation of the coast
system, his club is beginning to show
signs of development. Baker has six
letterrnen on his squad, boasting of
several heavy linemen, and a fast
shifty backfield. According to the
opinions expressed by those who have
seen the Teachers in action, they are
expected to develop into one of the
best t s in the history of the
school,’ and second only to the Uni-
versity of Iowa this season.

The main strength of the team is
on offense, where they use line
plunges to a great extent in gaining
ground. In the game against Cornell
they gained 168 yards from scrim-
mage to 54 for their opponents, the
