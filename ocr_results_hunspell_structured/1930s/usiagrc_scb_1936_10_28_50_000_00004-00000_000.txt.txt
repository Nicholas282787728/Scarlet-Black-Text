OUR POLICY

The editorial board of the Scarlet and
Black realizes that there must be many peo—
ple on the campus who are wondering,
“what nch 7" Therefore it would seem ex-
pedient to plesent at this time the policies
of the board. They can be briefly summar-
ized as being an attempt to fulfill the first
requisite of a college paper, that of express-
ing the prevailing tone of the campus as a
whole. It is our aim to do this in a sincere»
ly straightforward and cooperative manner:
It is not our intention to dictate a policy to
the student body. You have suggested our
policy to us, and we shall continue our at»
tempts to mold it into constructive, thought-
ful opinion, After all, the students are the
lie-all and end—all of every educational insti-
tution.

The editorial board chairman organized
his board on a class basis so that with the
passing of the present seniors, and the man—
aging editor of the paper, them will not be
a complete change iii the personnel of the
board; and the hopes and ideals of an annu-
ally different strident body will be carried on
from year to year through the medium of
the editorial board which will temper its
comment to reflect, insofar as it is possible
and wise, both the conservative and liberal
undercurrcnts present in our campus life,
At all costs we must be progressive.

At no time do we presume to be infallible
in our judgment. At all times, however, we
do strive to be open-minded and earnest in
our efforts to serve Grinnell for its best in—
terests, Like the Daily Northwestem of
Northwestern university, we have hitched
our wagon to a star. We ask every Grin»
ncllian to ride along with us. “if we fall,
we’ll fall with a bang, But if we ride, we‘ll
ride high.” —R.M.P,

DON’T ABDICATE!

It was President Coolidge who said that
if a man did not vote he abdicated his sov»
creignity; that " a man relinquishes his
vote through carelessness, others will seize
it and make use of it to wrest away that
man’s right of governing himself.

It is estimated that this year 20,000,000
eligible voters will not cast their votes be»
cause of lack of Illtel‘EStia lack of interest
inconceivable when one remembers that
wars have been fought and this nation built
on the pr nciple of participation by all in
governmental affairs.

As further example of this blasc attitude

 

toward politics, ill 1028, 15,000,000 people
had not even registered to vote and 3,000,000
had not informed themselves on the ballot-
ing procedure so that their ballots were
thrown out. Thus, 18,000,000 people in
that one year throw away their right to ex-
press their opinions about the way in which
they were being governed. And still we
hear criticism of the manner in which oil
ficials manage public affairs.

There is not the excuse of ignorance for
college students who do not vote, for all have
had courses ill government, at lens in high
school. We urge those of you eligible to
rot, to do your bit to prevent government
by the few, There is still time to obtain all
abs/lntee ballot and if you have questions,
write your home county attolliey for infor-
mation. 7J1).

REPRESENTATION REFORM NEEDED

As the 1036 national election is drawing
to a close. we might well stop and consider
a problem which has been facing our nation
since the years immediately following the
Civil War.

Every two years, the various states of
the union send to the House of Representa—
tives a number of persons to represent them
ill that body. The number of these rep '6»
solitatives is based upon the number of m—
‘Ziabitants ili each state, This method of ap-
pol‘tionmcnt was provided for in the Con-
stitution of the United States, and it was
meant to insure equal representation for the
American people ill every part of our coun—
try '

After the Civil W2 , the negro in the
South was granted the right to vote and the
l'clilcselitatioii of the southern states ill the
national house was increased. ,But, follow-
ing the misrule of the South by the negroes
who were led by the cmpet baggcrs, the
whites again seized control of southern af-
fairs and proceeded to refuse the Voting
franchise to the colored race.

In a comparison of a northern state and
a state in the South, we find that Iowa has
a population of 2,470,939 persons of 111.211
only 17,380 are negroes. In Georgia, we
find a total population of 2,008,506 persons
and 1,071,125 of these are negroes. Iowa
elects nine congressmen; Georgia, ten. Is
it fair that 2,470,930 Iowans should be rep—

in Congress by only nine Congress-
men \lnile 1,836,974 citizens of Georgia
should be represented by ten‘r7 For it is an
actual fact that those 1,071,125 negroes in
Georgia and the negroes in any other
southern state do not exercise the actual
right tovvote.

Shall we then continue this farce and
allow the southern white citizens to be un-
duly represented in Congress? Shall we
continue to pretend that the negroes have
the right to vote but deny that right to
them at the time of the elections? Or shall
we simply say that the negroes in the South
are not qualif’ d to vote and cut the south-
ern representation in Congress?

As the situation now prevails, the repre-
sentation in Congrsss is both unfair to the
negro and to the citizen in the eastern,
northern, and western sections of the United
States. ‘

It Surely seems that something- Should be
done about this problem, *J.D,N.

Other Opinions

More Reﬂections:

A gigolo is a man who earns his living by heart
labor.

Many a girl mahes herself a spectacle with two
glasses.

For Men Only:

Some girls many for money; some for love:
some because they're not taking a chance of want-
ing too long; some hecause they don’t know any bet»
tor, and then quite a few because they have no sense
of humor.

What about the girls that marry and then rlc»
velop a sense of Yuma?

., a e
Sympathy:

Pity the boys at Blackburn college:

There is only 51 per cent or a girl for every
boy, according to the latest enrollment figures,
which reveal that there are 150 boys to 122 girls.

After all, it’s better than nothing,
