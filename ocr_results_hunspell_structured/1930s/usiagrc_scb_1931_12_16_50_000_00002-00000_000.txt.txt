THE FAIR SOLUTION

Is the triplcrcut system fair? Campus opinion,
reflected ill tll . 1c of The: Scarlet and Black.
lean to the lllfil'lnfltivo Silll' of tho qu 'l’lnll. Of
the students whose opinions wt, c asked. one
asserted that a choice would he fairer. Surely this
would settle the, current. disputes on the ., tom,
and would do away with any hard feelings the
students may have on tho matter.

The dollar out system, prevalent find enforced
until this semester, unquestionably worked a hard.
ship on many students who could ill afford the
penalty. Doll; ts roll into real money, especially
if thc student in sed all his classes on the day her
fore and the day after a recess. College is n cxr
pensive proposition as it i , without the, odd ion of
a $10 or $12 penalty for cutting classes. U' the
student could afford tho penalty and deliberately
returned Lite from vocations, dollar cuts were ad-
mittedly deserved, But it was unfair to tllc student
who was unavoidably delayed ill his return, and
whose nleoge' pocketbook was in no position to
stand the stl' ill of a monetary ponziltv.

On first reflection, the triple»cut system may
seem a marked illlpl'ovcuicnt on tllc dollar one.
Actually, it is just us cxtol‘tionotc {IS the old sys-
tem. The majority of students, particularly scnio ',
can scarcely afford triple cuts. With an allowance
.of 18 cuts each semester, and the carryeovcrs from
the previous one deducted, tho oclitiounl 30 or 36
hours penalty cuts would mean 21 105 of two hou
or 11 minimum monetary loss of 0. Obviously,
this imposes a greater financial burden than under
the dollar cut system,

If students were allowed it choice of the two
systems, no one would on r too severe a penalty.
Those who lnlal‘ dollly incurred cuts on the days
pl'cc ding and following vacations would have no
Justi litloli for complaint; they could pay either
in lnoncy or in cllts, according to tllcir respective
pocketbooks and schedules, A choice of penalty
is unquestionably the only fair solution.

AID FOR THE NEEDY

In zl Speech . on before the women ill: the
Yule Log service Sunday evening, C. E. Payne,
professor of histo urged all to help the needy
this Christmas Sea. on. His request cannot be modal
too strongly ill view of the numbers of: unclllploi'cd
in the notion llntl of the fact that thousands of
people literally have not enough to out.

If those who have extra on off clothing would
give it to the social “'01 \CI lll their coinnlnnitios,
much Suffering could be alleviated. The social
service workers in one Iowa town or 5,000 find
that shoes are needed more than any other article
of clothing. The league cannot keep one pair of
men shoes ahead of the delnlind. In the same city
some children in grade schools have no footwear.

ln Viow of the need of ll persons, those who
have food, shelter, and clothing should share what
they have.

CLASSROOM DISHONESTY
(From (the Daily Northwestern)

Dean Addison Hibbard yesterday publicly deplored
the dishonesty of Northwestern students in the class
room. Cheating and academic dishonesty, he said, were
apparently increasing, and he gave as support for his
statement the fact that nine cases of dishonesty have
been reported to his office this fall, more than were
handled during the entire last year. One must agree
with Dean Hihbard that Northwestern students are dis
honest. that they, the great majority of them, believe in
“Crib if you can get away with it." Whether there has
been an increase or net, Dean Hibhnrd is in a better
position to say than we are, but we will accept his
statisties and also his conclusion.

Dean thbard offered as a solution of the cheating
problem a student group or board whieh would he ems
powered to act, at least in an advisory eapaeity, on all
eases of classroom dishonesty. No doubt his purpose is
to build up a student attitude which would condemn
cribbing and its allied sins, make it a social sin in the
student world.

HiS solution is excellent, as far as it goes. There
is a definite need for a central student governing body
to not with the administration on student discipline.
Sueh a body would simply discipline problems for the
university and it would give students some measure of
the self-government to which they are entitled. So far,
so good.

A hundred stutlent governing bodies, however, could
not solve the problem of elassroom dishonesty. They
could minimize it, perhaps. but never could they eradir
eate it. As long as colleges continue to place their pres-
ent emphasis on grades, dishonesty will be profitable.
As long as it is profitable, mere will he material-minded,
practicalrsouled students who will consider themselves
justified in using crib notes, or in sneaking a glanee at
the “A" student's exam paper.

It is significant that classroom dishonesty has in-
creased so radieally this year, for if one remembers
back to the winter of last year, one will remember that
the College of Liberal Arts adopted at that time a new
grade system. Instead of simplifying the already over-
complicated grade scale, the faculty doubled its com—
plexity, and doubled the number of grades possible by
including minus grades.

Under the new grade system elass dishonesty be-
comes more profitable than ever before. The importance
of an extra few points on an examination is emphasized
even more than before. and the temptation to dishonesty
becomes even more powerful under the new grading
system.

Establish a student governing board, Dean I-Iibbard,

but also consider your grading system if you are sine -

cerely concerned about student morality.

’ GUTS
(From the Iowa 5mm Student)

“It took 'guts' to do that," somebody says. Do you
ever wonder what he means? Did you ever hear somer
body say at football practice, “That man has ‘guts'Y"
The same thing might be expressed in other words.
You might say "courage" or you might say “nerve'
You might say one of a dozen things, but it is doubtful
if any word would convey the meaning as well as that
four-letter. homely little word.

You cannot pay any person a higher compliment
than to ehai-acterize him as having guts. You might
eulogize on his virtues for hoursicall him heroic or
greatibut you would never praise him as much as you
would if you said he had guts.

Your man who has guts doesn't think of himself.

He is thinking of the thing he's working for. Your man .

who runs a mile and a half with a broken leg isn’t think-

And to prove his case he asserts
that out of 29,704 Americans who
have ntteiued distinction in various
lines ot endeavor, 934 of them were
born in Iowa. or these the greatest
number have llchleved greatness in

There are more lawyers, eoneort

and farmers from Iowa. listed in

There are world teachers and

lsts as Well as n few coal operators,
meal packers and accountants. Ono
president of the United States and
one president's wife are from Iowa.

Only 368 of the Who's Who in
America group reside in this state—
whrch means that Iowa has given the
world 564 leaders, One out of every
2,269 native horn Iowans has shown
leadership and ability which rank
him among the Who's Who for 1330-
31. In the country at large one out
of every 4,040 of the population had
a place in the distinguished group.
Thus Iowa's ratio exceeds that of the
country at large by 51 per cent.
