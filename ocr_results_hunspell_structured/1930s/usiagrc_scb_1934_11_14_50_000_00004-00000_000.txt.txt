Hurrey Speaks
Monday Evening

(Continued. Rom Page 1)

less active", Mr. Hurrey explained.

The speaker pointed to several mis.
apprehensions which are prevalent in
legal-d to South America. The first
is that the continent of South Ameri—
ca is not directly south of the United
States but also east; second, that the
countries are not populated by one
homogeneous group; and third, Lhat
race discrimination in Brazil and Con.
tral America has, until recently, been
much less prevalent than in the Unit—
ed States.

Lures Many Typos

"South America has n lure for all
sorts or people,” declared Mr. Hurrey.
The mountains and jungles lure the
explorer; the ancient ruins, the arch»
eologist; and the farm land and power
possibilities lure the agriculturalist
and the engineer,

“The American conceives Mexico as
a land of bandits and bull fights.
while Mexicans and South Americans
think the people of the United States
dollar—minded, endeavoring to domi-
nate the Central and South American
countries," the speaker said in corn
trasting the two attitudes,

Exchange of Students

The Pan—American New Deal should
be characterized by a greater exchange
of students between North and South
America, with more students going
from the United States to the South
American universities to study; by a
modification of the Monroe doctrine;
and by a shift to a policy of sending
better qualiﬁed people to South
America to conduct the handling of
the diplomatic relations. in closing,
the speaker quoted William Jennings
Bryan's famous statement, ”The Lord
has made us neighbors; let justice
make us friends."

Mr_ Hurray was a war-thne“buddy"
of President John S. Nollen, They
worked together in Italy during the
World War as members of the Young
Men's Chrisian association’s staff in
that country. At present the speaker
is in charge of foreign students who
come to this country to study.
