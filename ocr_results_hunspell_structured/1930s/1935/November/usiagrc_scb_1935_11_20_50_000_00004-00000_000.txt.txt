Several Men Ineligible
for Game Saturday

A squad of about 25 players
will travel to Mt. Vernon Satlli'»
day to engage in the second fresh
man football tilt of the season.
meeting the Cornell irosb as part
of the annual Homecoming cele.
bration there. The game is schedr
uled to start at 9:30 a. in

Conch John Truesdale expressed
but meager hopes for victory
when interviewed yesterday. “Be
cause of ineligibilities we will be
seriously handicapped," he said,

The fresh starting lineup will
probably be composed of those men
who started in the Tutor game last
weekend The attack of the preps
will depend mainly upon passes.
due to the Cornellians’ weight ad-
vantage, which will make line
plays nearly useless. Coach Trues-
dale has given his men several new
pass plays designed to give them a
better scoring punch via the air—-
lanes.

Practice this week has been de-
voted to some scrimmage with the
varsity, but Truesdale plans to to-
per off in preparation for the game
Saturday in order to make sure
that no last moment injuries hand-
icap the team.

"Europe will be reduced to a char
otic state with a great spread of
communism in central and eastern
Europe after the next war,” he 254
serted. America will not be able to
find a market under such condi-
tions, and it will be merely a mat-
ter of good business for the United
states to refrain from dealing
with the warring nations for a few
years, the speaker said.

, Sanctions Partly Effec e

In discussing the probable effec-
tiveness of the present sanctions
of the League of Nations. Mr,
Stowe declared that they would be
only partly effective, but probably
in a long time would reduce Italy
to a point of submission.

He also expressed the opinion
that Mussolini is willing to com»
promise now, on a basis of Italy
gaining enough territory to con-
nect Italian Somaliland with Erit—
rea and economic concessions in

Ethiopia similar to those now en-
joyed by the English in Egypt.
Such a compromise will not occur
unless Great Britain is willing to
give in, and “the decision for war
or peace will be made in London,”
Mr. Stowe said.

The cause for the Italian mad-
ness in Ethiopia is due to foul' real»
sons, the speaker asserted. They
are: overpopulation, desperate need i
for raw materials, resentment
against the division of German col-
onies in the treaty of Versailles.
and the desire Lo secure freedom
from British dominance.
