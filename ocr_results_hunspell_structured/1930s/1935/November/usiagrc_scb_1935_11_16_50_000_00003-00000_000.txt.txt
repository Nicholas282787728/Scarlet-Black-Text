1mm, late to Game

The following season Grinncll
triumphed over Ellsworth, Carle-
ton. Simpson and Drake by large
scores. but lost LovIowa and Min-
nesota. In commenting on the
Iowa game the Scarlet and Black
criticized Iowa for being late in ap-
pearing. causing the last 15 min~
utes to he played in the dark. "a
condition disagreeable to both
players and spectators."

The 1898 team. one of th most
successful in Pioneer histol/fi, beat
Minnesota, 16-6. for the second
time in history, heat Nebraska and
tied Iowa. The only defeat was at
the hands of Drake in the’ final
game of the season, 18-16. How-
ever. the locals had triumphed over
Drake earlier in the schedule, 12-
10. This was the first time Drake
had won a contest with the Pio-
neers. and was the first year that
the Bulldogs had even scored on
the Scarlet and Black aggregation.

Successful in 1899

The 1899 season was equally suc-
cessnil. as the team won eight
games. lost one. tied one, Iowa
won 13-0. while the tie game was
with Minnesota. Among the teams
defeated were Amos and Nebras-
ka.

The following season Minnesota
triumphed 26-0. This was de-
scrihed as the first decislve score
in the series. Wisconsin rolled up
a 45-0 count, Nebraska a 33-0
count. while Iowa took the meas-
ure of the Grinnellians 32-2.

Lose One Game

Iowa gave the locals the only
trimming in 1901. in a game in
which the state championship was
at stake. The Minnesota game was
called off because of theoeath of
the‘ governor of Minnesota.

Pioneer grid fortunes were at a

low ebb in 1902 as they won but
two games, and lost to Minnesota
iby a 102-0 score. The following
season was more successful,

The real low was reached in
1904 when the only game iwhlch
‘ Grinncll won was a 5-0 victory
over East High School of Des
Moines in the opening game of the
season.

Minnesota administered the Flu-
incers the worst beating in Crin-
nell history by tronncing them
! 146-0. Incidentally. this game
marked a severance in football re-
iations between the two schools.
although no mention of the reason
i’ was found.

Plays Creighton

Grinnell came hack the follow-
ing year by winning seven games,
losing one and tying one In 1907
the pioneers triumphed in three

iit of five contests, and the next
year won five and lost four. one
of the defects was’at the hands of
‘Creighton by an 8-7 score. This
game has previously been omitted
from the records of the game be-
tween the two schools. as it has
been believed that grid relations
between the two institutions did
not start until 1923.

The 1910 team was expected to
he a contender for the state chain-
pionship. but lost to Drake. 13-9
and to Cornell in the season finale,
25-0. ‘

Poor Record in 1914

Season records for 1912 and 1913
reveal fair success. but the 1914
rword is bad. After winning two
of the first three games. including
a 20-0 win over Drake. the Pio-
neers lost to Carleton 68-0. to Coe
.85-0, and to Monmouth. 75-0.

A headline on the account of the
Monmouth game read thus, “Play
Defensive Game." The sting of
these trouncings was somewhat re-
moved when the Scarlet and Black
team triumphed 14-0 over their
arch-rivals, Cornell. in the first
game. i '

By Henry Hirsch

Two intramural protests have
come up since the start or the
intramural season. One iu'ose
over the claim that itnwson hall
used two incligihle men in their
opening speedbnll game. but the
protest was overruled, The sec-
ond arose over a dispute over the
scoring of points in the opening
volleyball game between Smith
and Clark. This brings up the
point of just what should he
the purpose of intramurnls. com-
petitive spirit between the halls
or the opportunity of giving ev—
eryone a chance. in some form of
athletics. This scribe will not
try to ienture an opinion. but
will leave it up to the reader to
decide,

it”

Three members of the football
squad, Jack Osborn. Boh Reescr
and Jay Ramsey. turned in their
suits this week. None of the boys
have played 'rcgilarly but all have
appeared in the Pioneer lineup dur-
ing the course of the season.

No end of speculation is now
floating about the dorms as to
the exact reason that Jerry
Rigan went out for foothnll this
week. The general consensus of
opinion of those in the know is
that the notion is either the re.
sult of a bet or is a build-up for
a bet.

' sous

That old paradox of comparative
scores comes up again. We can fig.
ure no less than five outcomes for
the Coe-Pioneer tilt.

1. Carleton whipped Coe 12-0.
while the Pioneers heat Carleton
7—6. This makes Crinnell 13 points
better than Coe.

2. Cornell won a 9-3 decision
over Carleton. which puts the Cor-
nellians 2 points ahead of Gri -
nell. Inasmuch as Coe and Cor-
nell battled to a scoreless tie Coe
should be 2 points ahead of the
local griddcrs,

3. Wiui Cornell two points better
than Grinnell according to the pre-
vious comparison. and Cornell and
the state Teachers even as a result
of a 0-0 tie. the Teachers are two
points better than Crinnell. Coe

the Pioneers 7-7. Coe by 15 points.

5. The Teachers tied Crinnell,
Cornell tied the Teachers and Cor-
nell tied Coe. Verdict: a tie.

We could go on and on like this
forever and ever but what does it
prove? By the time this is off the
press the Coe and Cornell game
will he a thing of the .past'. This
is merely one more proof that
scores mean less than nothing.

Through the use of compara-
three, a campaign was started a
few yea 5 been. booming the
Kirksville State Teachers for the
national championship. perhaps
with the aid of n corps of statis-
tioians. the Scarlet and Black
can produce figures to show that
the Pioneers are the nation's
host.
