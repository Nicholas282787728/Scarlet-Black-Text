Iowa Doctor lo Lecture
on Sex Dec. 3, 5

Dr. E, D. Plass, head of the tier
partment of obstetrics and gynec-
ology at the University of Iowa,
has been selected to deliver lec-
tures on sex and sex matters to the
freshmen orientation classes on
Dec 3 and Dec. 5.

The lecture on Dec. 3 will be
made before the combined classes
of men and women and will be held
in the Alumni Recitation hall au-
ditorium at 11:20 a. in.

To Give Separate Talks

On Dec. 5, he will speak to the
men's and women's classes sepa—
rately, hut definite plans have not
as yet been completed. as to when
and where the talks will be made.

Members of the faculty, pre-
medical students, and any others
who desire to do so and do not have
conflicting classes are invited to
attend the lectures.

“The pumose of the lectures,"
according to Shelton L. Beatty,
dean of men, "is to present a scien-
tific and straightforward analysis
‘of the place of sex in life, and to
remove the misinformation which
exists concerning this.”

lectured Last Year

Dr. Plass delivered two lectures
here last year on the subject of sex
anatomy and sex hygiene, He
spent 11 years as instructor and
associateprofessor at Johns Hope
kins university and five years as
chief obstetrician at the Henry
Ford hospital at Detroit before
coming to Iowa.

The lectures are being arranged
by Dean Beatty and Dean Evelyn
Gardner as part of the program of
the orientation classes.

THE GRJNNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

DORIC

in Column at Pure urn-rm

Last week we promised to lay
off the Maltoaser for a while, but
we just can't resist mentioning
them this one time. We have
learned through the editor of the
Scarlet and Black that at a Sigma
Delta Chi meeting a while back,

. Lyle carver, business manager of

Molly, blithely announced that the
next edition of that famous and
widelmeown scandal rag would
reveal the identity of the editor of
the Doric, which is pretty funny,
because even if they did know for
sure, they couldn't prove anything,
Better men than they have failed.
. a a
At that, we suppose their guess
is as good as anyone's.
. v e
And here's probably the Wt
story to date. Seems that Bill
Buffe, erstwhile iashion-plate
about the campus, had a date
with his friend Dow last Satur-
day etc. However, he decided to
go to the show, so one of the
boys obllgingly caued the girl
friend and got him out of it on a
plea. of extreme illness. After the
show Buffs strolled into Candy-
land, hale and hearty, to meet
none other than the aforemenr
tioned Miss Dow and Warren
Peorcckll: Which all goes to
show, Bill, that crime docs not
pay, and youju never get to
heaven that way.

No stendies to announce this
week, but a few of the local
loveJlirds have definitely cooled
off, including Huston and the
blonde actress, and Misbnch and

AS yet Huston has found no oth»

affiliation, but most of May—
Floyd’s waking hours out of class
have been monopolized by Wells
Barnett, one of the assistant edi-
tors of the s. tr B, She is also a

So the whole think smacks a
trifle of mixing business with
plcasure.

Glallcing Back

40 Years Ago r

The town Humane society atr
tended the Gﬁmlell~Ames game to
investigate roughness. President
Hale Bump said, “I am not neces-
sarily opposed to the game of foot—
ball when properly played, but I
am opposed to the unnecessary and
brutal methods which characterize
some of the games . . . If we see
any dirty work or any intentional
injuries inflicted we will take a
hand and see what the society can
do about it."

The college was preparing for
the semi-annual week of prayer.
Quoting the Scarlet and Black,
“Let us all prepare ourselves so
that the spirit of prayer may per-
vade the atmosphere of Iowa col-
lege during the next week.”
