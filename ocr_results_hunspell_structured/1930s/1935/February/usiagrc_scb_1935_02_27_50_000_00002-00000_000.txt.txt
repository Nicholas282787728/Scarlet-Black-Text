FENCE VAULTING, NOW

Editor Frank Miles of the Iowa Legionaire
takes vociferous exception in the current issue
oil that publication, to the editorial which recently
appeared in 'The Scarlet and Black under the title
“Fence Straddling.” This editorial, in short, dis-
agreed with the Legionaire in approving the stand
taken by Editor Don Pryor of the Daily Iowan
in refusing to support on the Iowa university
campus the recent college peace poll and dis—
agreed with Pryor’s attitude of refusing to allow
his paper “to be used as an organ of propaganda
or publicity for anyone, whether I agree with him
or not."

The point we wished to make was, that a col-
lege paper should support worthwhile movements
and their backers just as much as independent
newspapers. Editor Miles adds in a vigorous but
rather confused manner, his disapproval of our
attitude in this matter to that of Editor Pryor,

Says the Legionaire editor, “The Daily Iowan,
The Scarlet and Black and all other like college
publications are for virtually as general circula-
tion as a privately owned paper or magazine. The
private publisher, if he is>honest, gives fair play
to all thought in his news columns, and permits
no one to use them for personal promotion; he has
a perfect right to try to mould opinion in his edi-
tqrials.”

So far we agree perfectly with our cr
However, he adds that The Scarlet and Black edi-
tor apparently believes, “Because I am the college
editor, I speak for the college. My opinions must
be accepted by it as its own, regardless of whether
all the students, the alumni, the donors and the
trustees approve them.” He continues, in bold
type, ‘I-Iis opinion of what is beneficial for Grin—
nell should be given no more prominence than the
opinion of any student who disagrees with him.
He, nor any other public college editor, should be
allowed to write editorials,”

That, we should say, in consideration of the
first quoted paragraph, is not “fence straddling”
but “fence vaulting."

We don’t feel inclined to put up a detailed
defense of our editorial policy. We might mention
that any reader who wishes to disagree in print
to anything that appears in this column has only
to write and express his views and his letter will
be given all the prominence Mr, Miles could de-
sire. Furthermore, no privately owned news~
paper, which we are “virtually like,” has ever yet
been in agreement with all his readers, so why
should we consider it necessary to reflect only the
common opinions of student body, administration,
donors, et all This is not a class publication which
must adhere to dictates from above, be they right
or wrong. And lastly, heaven forbid that anyone
get the idea that we expect the readers of this
paper to docily accept the opinions of the editorial
writers as their own, or that these opinions be con
sidered as an expression of the opinion of the col—
lege. No, Mr. Miles, The Scarlet and Black does
not seek, to be “the voice of Grinnell college," any
more than the New York Times claims to he the
voice of New York City.

Ordinarily» we would consider editorial quib~
bling of this sort to have no place in the columns
of the paperithat it should be conﬁned to per—
sonal correspondence; but if Editor Miles feels
that the controversy deserves an entire column in
his publication, we can hardly feel it “belittling”
to respond in a like manner.

“TORTURE" AT IOWA

The “torture probe” ordered by President
Eugene A. Gilmore of the State University of
Iowa, calls to mind the recent abolition of prep—
ping on the Grinnell campus.

Without a doubt the issue was given more light
in the public eye than even the president antici-
pated, for the question developed into a battle of
words between Prof. Edward B. Router, head of
the sociology department and Assistant Dean of
Men Lonzo P. Jones, to whom the investigation
was referred by President Gilmore.

Professor Reuter, in a letter to the Daily Iowan,
student newspaper, charged that the assistant
dean had understated the situation. Charging
that several students were in the hospital or under
the care of doctors as a direct result of “hell
week” on the Iowa campus, the profesmr offered
to stop the letter before publication -
would retract his too mild statemc
refused and the battle continues.

The whole incident might have been “makincr
a mountain of a mole hill,” though in TCVC
cases there probably was an oversteppilld of c
lege rules; but efforts to merely curtail p‘
and hazing have never proved successful.
hearted attempts which have been made to checltr
mate the time—worn initiation practices of fratern
ities have been of little value.

Today announcement was made that hazing at
Iowa, as at Grinnell, has been definitely outlawed,
and that a fraternity council is to be formed to
investigate any violations of the new ruling. In
taking this step the state university joins Grinnell.
the University of Illinois, Southern California, and
a number of other schools who have finally decid-
ed that the only way to evade the embarrassing
situations that annually accompany “hell week"
is to completely abolish the system at the bottor‘
of the evil.

BRINKLEY MANOR, by P. G.
Wodehouse. it may seem queer that
we should follow a plea for wider
reading of contemporary fiction among
college men by reviewing Wodehouse’s
latest addition to the Jeeves saga.
Surely no one who has made Bertie
Wooster's acquaintance need be urged
to renew their association with that
troubleefinding blighter. In this work
he takes a hand in the love affairs of
two of his friends because things are
not going as they should. In that fine
Woosterian manner, Bertie succeeds in
producing a condition miserably close
to chaos. As always Jeeves, the in.
comparable, s'teps in and with a few
vmlLtimed gutures straightcns matters
out. '

The Wodehouse formula never
changes, yet each book is such dc.
lightful nonsense that the reader is
convinced that Jeeves and Bertie

Wooster have shown up at their balm.
iest and best, The time spent in read-
log a Wodehouse epic never seems
wasted because it furnishes the most
exquisitely futile pleasure we can
think of, That testimony alone should
be sufficient to persuade the average
college man to dip into the book.

PLO‘VING ON SUNDAY, by Star].
ing North, There are ever so many
people who prefer to read about life
(ls they would like it to be rather
than as it really is so that this picture
of life on a Wisconsin farm, painted
in colors more rosy than realistic, will
have no lack of readers. Even those
of us who thought we preferred real.
ism have become weary of the endless
procession of novels portraying farm
life in the Middle 'West in its blackest
colors. Unfortunately, most writers
do not realize that it is not necessary
to continually play on the disgusting
and revolting to make their people
ring true to life.

The local of this is a [arm in south.
ern Wisconsin, twenty years ago. The
chief character is Stud Brailsfol’d, a
giant of great strength, who good.
naturedly bullies his gentle wife, pam.
pei‘s his cattle, wistfully wishes he had
more than one son, makes uncasy love
to the pretty hired girl, and is happy
and Content in the hope of grand.
children at the end of the story.

The story is written in a simple,
lucid prose that adds dignity to the
rather simple theme. The reader is
relieved on closing the book to know
that during these years at least the
farmer was looking optimistically to
the future and not bewailing his sorry
fate to all who would lend a sym.
pathetic car. '

Law School Curriculums
Require Constant Changing

ANN ARBOR Mich.—(ACP)—Thosc
who have to do with the construction of
law school curriculums these days
are having their troubles~that is, if we
are to listen to Henry M, Bates, dean
of the University of Michigan's famed
law school.

“More and more the legal profession
is called on, not to get its clients our
of trouble, but to prevent them from
getting into trouble,” he said. “We arc
confident that a better arrangement
than the orthodox treatments of those
subjects in the public law is possible.”

school curriculum: to meet changes in
business and industry, the dean sai .
“These changes (in business and in.
dustry) undeniably have produced
shifts and changes of emphasis in the
kinds litigation and of legal services
of all kinds. Thus, the law in relation
to many matters in the field of com.
merce and property has become seL
tied . so that litigation in those fields
has relatively declined."

“On the other hand,” he added, ”new
problems relating in parts of fields just
referred to, and especially in such

. other fields as taxation, public utilities

and the vast area covered by the NRA
codes have come to the fore."
