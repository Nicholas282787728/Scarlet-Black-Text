College Students
Show Opposition
to League Entry

A slight sentiment against Amgl‘ican
entry into the League oi Nations and
a very delinite disapproval oi inilitar.
istic principles were revealed in the
announcement today oi the iinal re.
sults oi the peace poll recently con.
ducted by the Association oi Collegc
Editors in collaboration with The Lit_
eiai y Digest.

Ballots were returned by 112,507
students in 118 leading American Cal.
leges and universities.

By a margin oi 54,510 to 55,680
votes the collegiaiis expressed disiaver
oi United States cntry into the Leagu
On this question the University oi
Iowa ballot approved U. S, entry into
the League, 503 to 527, while Washing.
ton univeisity, the only Missouri
Valley school participating in the poll,
reflected a similar attitude by a Vote
of 555 to 410.

U. 5. Can Evade War

Quericd as to whether the United
States could stay out of another great
war the vote stood more than 2 to 1
in the afﬁrmative; asked it the but:
ders oi the United States were invaded
would you bear arms in defense of
your country?” 33.54 per cent oi the
students declared they would, while
16.46 gave a negative answer.

When questioned whether they
would bear arms ior U. S. should‘the
country invade the borders oi anoths
er country, however, only 17,82 per
cent responded aiiirmatively, while
32,18 asserted that they would iciuse.

On the question oi universal con.
scription oi all resources of capital
to conool proiits in time oi war the
collegians ballotcd nearly 5 to 1 in
iavor, while they showed an over.
wholming 9 to 1 advocacy oi govern.
lnent control of armament and munia
tion industries.

Against “Armed Peace"

The general disapproval oi building
ior an ”armed peace” was expressed

 

in the response to the question, “is
maintaining a navy and ail‘sfm'ce sec.
end to none a sound method oi in.
suring us against being drawn into
another great war?” The results on
this query were 69,715 opposed and
41,407 for.

In analyzing the vote on the League
of Nations entry, The Digest stated
that in 55 schools membership gained
a iavorable majority and in 53
an unfavorable “It is iair to” conclude,"
stated The Digest, “from study oi the
results, that in general those colleges
which have well established reputas
tioins ior liberal educational policies
are these colleges which voted in
iavor oi entry into the League oi Na.
tions.”

Audience Applauds

New Composition
(Continued From Page 1)

ant contrast to the virile, energetic
numbers preceding and following them.
The Liadow “Music Box”wasplayed
with delightful dash and smartness,
ending within almost amusing cadence
to complete the composition. Lecuona’s
“Malaguena” was the direct opposite
of the "Music Box." it was plainly a
weighty selection, and demanded a
strength oi interpretation which Mrs.
Ryan was assuredly capable oi giving
it.

Mr. Blum and Mrs. Ryan gave Grin.
nell people a program oi such distinct
superiority that it shall remain a most
agreeable thing in their minds for
some time to come.
