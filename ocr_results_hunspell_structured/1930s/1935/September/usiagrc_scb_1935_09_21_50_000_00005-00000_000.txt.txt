Strange as it may seem the
Grinnell football men are praying
and not from fright at the pros-
pects of facing Michigan state
next Saturday. but rather in
hopes that they may invoke Divine
assistance and have an early frost
which will relieve the numerous
hay-fever victims on the squad.
Jim Bradley is credited with
smoking the vilest concoctions in
an effort to find relief, but has

only enjoyed a partial success.

Dolph Ewart, rotund sophomore'

center, gave the crowd at Fella a
laugh last night. In the third
quarter Dolph was sent into the

Tlle‘

igame when the team was in a po-
,sition on the field about as far from
lthe bench as possible, When about
10 yards out onto the field he

zest to activities on the Central
field last night, Every time action
would get a little dull one of the

Drakes opponents next year will
have plenty to worry ahoiit.

ioffensive. uncorkiiig a number of
nice gains, in spite of the fact
that the Pioneer blocking left
much to he desired. Several times
the ball carriers were apparently
in the clear and, given a little
blocking, would have produced
several touchdown runs. Bradley
and Sampson did good defensive
work in the Grinnell backfield.
The Pioneer ends worked well.
