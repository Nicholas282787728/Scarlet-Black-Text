Critic Finds ‘Lack of Subtlety’
in Skinner’s Drama Recital

Humor Quite Apparent;i
Audience Enjoys

Man-y Laughs '

By Carl Niemeyer i

If the large audience which ap—
peared last Saturday night at the
Grinnell High school to hear Miss
Cornelia Otis Skinner open the
college lecture course, came to be
amused, they could not have gone
away disappointed; for in the lit
tle world of characters to whom
she introduced us. there was much
at which to laugh.

The English
ingly lecturing
ican audience about some vague
ly localized head-hunters; a
Philadelphia mother helping her
12-year-old son with his “oruthmeA
tie"; a Montana lady just before
she is presented at court; and a
distracted mother unsuccessfully
taking care of her small baby, all
provided amusement for the audi-
ence.

Wisely perhaps, Miss Skinner
chose to let tragedy alone; and

Iih the Times Square sketch and in

that about the Barbadian octar

lroon, it was well-mannered, digni-

fied tragedy that did not require
its sufferers to rant and tear a
passion to tatters. There was nev-
:er any need for the audience to
'squirm in their seats with embar-
assment.

All this suggests both the mer-
its and the limitations of Miss
Skinner's performance. The person
who could not laugh at her chare
acterizations must have been very
dull indeed, but many may well
have wondered between laughs
whether there should not be some»

'thing more,

Of the medium in which she
works Miss Skinner is a mistress;
she has been often imitated, and
there are not more than one or
two who surpass her. Profession-
ally minded members of the audi-
ence must have noticed the skill
with which she used her hands. the
fine simplieity of her gestures, the
beautifully modulated volceaa
technique so perfectly mastered
that it has become unobtrusive.
But they might also have regret-
ted that so much skill was lavished
on material merely bright and su-
perficial. Even the poetry she
chose to read. Emile. Vel‘haeren‘h
brilliant description of the Novem-
ber wind, was chiefly notable for
its onomatopoeic effects. ,

Performance at Fantastic Hour

One felt throughout the program
a lack of subtlety, and that Miss
Skinner. if she was not exactly
stooping to conquer. was certainly
not leaning over backwards.

It is only decent to ”remork"
(as the Philadelphia lady would
say) that we should be grateful to
the lecture committee for bringing
Miss Skinner to Grinncll. It is a
pity, however, that the perform~
ance should have been scheduled
to begin at the fantastic hour of
7:30 o'clock, especially since it
was impossible to reserve seats;
and it is even more of 2. pity that
it actually began at 7:25 o'clock
and that the intermission was so
brief as to compel some members
of the audience to miss the first
part of the sketch about the Bos-
ton woman at the summer hotel.

‘Students Need
to Develop
Culture’-Nollen

“students should cease to pre-
pare for any particular field, but
should concentrate upon acqlllrlng
a cultural background which will
enable them to fit into any sort of
position." declared Mr. Gerard S,
Nollen. in his address before the
Commerce club Sunday afternoon.

the topic, “Life Insurance AS a
Business,” is president of the
Bankers Life Insurance company
of Des Moines and newly-elected
president of the National Life In-
surance association.

He told of the organization or
the modern insurance corporation,
which offers opportunities to men
trained in fields of medicine. law.
finance and Mtllrial work, as well
as those trained in salesmanship.

“It is impossible to succeed in
the insurance business without
feeling that insurance is a life
work," he declared, “It should be
regarded as being worthy of great
concentration and not as a stop-
‘gap to fill in the holes between
jobs"

Jensen Captures Race

Roy Jensen '38, won the one mile
steeplechase race held on the Ward
fieldrtrack Saturday afternoon be
tween the halves of the Grimello

Nabb '39, was third; and Theodore
Smith '39, took fourth. The win-

Jensen led the race from the
start, except for a few seconds at
the end of the first lap, when he
stumbled over one of the obstacles
and fell, momentarily losing the
lead to Blaikie. Jensen, however,
quickly recovered and again took
the lead.
