Made in Co-eds’
Sport Program

A radical revision has been made
in the plans for conducting the rest of

_Mordy, quadrangle sports captain, yes.

terday. Instead of awarding points
[or each individual event on the
spring program, the rankings of the
cottages in each event will be taken
and added together, and the actual
points awarded on the basis of the
average ranking of the cotmges.

“This year the entire sports pro.
gram for the spring will be regarded,
in the awarding of intramural points,
as one activityﬁthe [our individual
sports being considered similar to the
separate events in a field meet." Miss
Mordy, explained.

The individual spring sports pro.
gram will include four parts—badmin.
(on, tennis, archery and golfAbui will
drop volley ball and baseball, two
sports formerly included.

A revision has also been made in
the practice requirements, she reveal.
cd. Instead of requiring five practices
as has been the rule hei‘etofor, only
two practices will be required. This
will enable women to compete who
did not have the time to put. in the
five practices as formerly required.

The preliminary evenfs is each of
the individual sports will be run off
at various times during the spring, and
the finals in all the events will be run
off at the same time in the form of
a field day. The exact date for this
part of the program has not as yet
been set, Miss Mordy said, but. it will
probably occur sometime in the Early
part of May.

Plan Deviszd to Check
Hitch-Hiking by Co-ezlt

Plans designed to assist women in
getting to Des Moinec, drawn up in an
effort to check the recent tendency of
the co.eds to hitch.hike, were reveal.
ed at cotuge meeting Monday night.

In an effort to provide an adequate
substitute for hitch.hiking, the league
board collectively has written a letter
to the faculty members requesting
them to notify Evelyn Gardner, dean of
women, or Betty Tehbens, president
of the league board, whenever they
contemplate driving to Des Moines and
have room for an extra passenger.

A similar notification has been sent
to all college women living in town.
Through these notifications to profes.
sors and town women, it is hoped that
I'Ides will be provided for those women
who wish to spend a day in Des
Moines.

Women wishing to make the trip
are asked to notify their cottage chair.
man, with whom the dean of women
and the league board president will
cooperate in an effort to secure trans.
portation for the co.eds.

Pioneers Have Gained More Fame
in Track Than in Any Other Sport

Grinnell Records Compare
Very Favorably With
State Marks

With the approachofspring and the
inauguration of another track season,
Grinnell once again is entering its
favorite sport element. Though Grin
nell was one of the lust schools to
introduce football west of the Missis.
sippi and was a pioneer in basketball
competition, its greatest athletic suc.
cess has been in track. More great
athletes have bccn produced in this
sport at Grinnell than in any other,
and the school has gained more lame
on the cinder u-ack than 'on both the
gridiron and the basketball court.

A review of track records establish.

Contest Picked

March 20 Date Designated
for Prize Competition

in Men’s Section

Six men qualified for die ﬁnals Of
the men's Spaulding speech conest
in the preliminary trials held Saturday
afternoon, These six will compete in
the finals of the contest on Wednes.
day evening, March 20, at 1:30 o’clock
in Herrick chapel.

The men who qualified are: Roger
Moon, Raymond Goodenow, William
Phillips, William Maxeiner, Dwight
Porter, and William tourisbury. Each
of them will deliver an oration—either
written by the speaker or someone
else—not to exceed eight minutes in
length.

Goudcnow Qualifies Again

Of the men who qualified, only one
—Raymond Goodenowhas had pre.
vicus experience in the Spaulding con.
tcsts. He placed second in the contest
in 1933 and took third place last year.
Three of the contestants are fresh
men; Phillips, Porter and Lounsbury
being the first year men.

The judges for the preliminary trials
were Joseph w. Charlton, associate
professor of economics; E. E. T. Spenc.
er, professor of Greek; and John
Eridgham, profemor of Latin.

Voss I934 Winner

The Spaulding contest last year was
won by William Voss, then a sopho.
more, while second place was awarded
to David Phillips, who is now student
assistant in the speech department,

The prizes for the Spaulding con.
tests are awarded with the intention of
'su'mulating interest among both ‘Lhe
men and women of the college in the
art of speaking in public. The emphasis
is placed upon the delivery of the
speaker rather than upon the content
of the speech.

A sum of $100 was formerly divided
between the winners of the first three
places, but due to a decrease in the
income from the funds eslablished to
finance the contest, it has not been
possible in recent years to award the
full amounts.

here only last year.
