Lanux Suggests

That U. 5. Adopt
Anti- War Code

That America might be able to do
much for world peace by declaring
that any act ol war would be con.
sidered as being ruitriendly to the
United States, was the suggestion ofe
tercd by Pierre de Lanux as a means
of America cooperating more hilly in
the ettorts tor peace without bind.
ing herselt to join the League of Na.
trons. Mr. Lanux, director of the
Paris oiticc of the League ot Nations,
lectured Monday night in He iek
chapel on the "League ol Nation '

In advocaﬁng the American pro,
nouncement, Mr, Lanux pointed om
how eitectiue the Monroe doctrine,
likewise a American pronouncement,
had been and expressed the heliet that
the very indetiniteiiess of a similar
declaration would tend to add to the
ctleetiveness of the statement.

the history ot the
foundation ot the League, he pointed
out that the organization was an out.

At the time of the incorporation of
the League covenant into the Treaty
ot Versailles, there were two con.
llieting views as to‘ how the organiza.
tion of the League should be accome
plished, The French were in iavor
of creating,» super-sstatc with real
power to enter-cc its commitments,
while the Anglo—SaxonsiGrsaL Bri.
tain and the United Stateksupportcd
the idea oi only moral obligations.
This idea irnally pr-erarled and was
the basis of the League's organization,
Mr. Lanux continued.

Gradual Support at Lcaguc

Tracing the ups and downs at the
world peace movement, the speaker-
pointed ‘out that for a few years there
was no support ot the League and
then gradually people began to think
t at the idea of universal cooperae
1 ii might be worth trying.

From 1923 until 1931 the League
made gradual progres towards be
ing a real instruinent tor inaintai ng
peace, the speaker pointed out, but
since 1931 a series of events occur-red
which caused a detinite regression in
the intluenee of the League. The first
or these events was the death oi the
German statesnran, Stresemann, the
man who had been responsible [or
Garmay entering Ihst League, Thus
Germany lost the able guidance of a
sincere believer in world peace.
