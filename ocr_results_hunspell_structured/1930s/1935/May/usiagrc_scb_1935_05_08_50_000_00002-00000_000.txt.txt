SANENESS NEEDED

During the past seven years the American
people have shown that they can easily be stam-
peded in almost any direction a clever politician
and speaker wishes them to go.

First came the Republican landslide of 1928
when Hoover was swept into office by the largest
electoral college majority in history, on a “full-
dinner pail" platform. Then, after four years, the
temper of the country swung in just exactly the
opposite direction when Roosevelt overwhelmed
Hoover in the presidentiaL vote, and then broke
Hoover’s record, by rolling an even larger major-
ity in the electoral college. Both these landslides,
however, were toward conservative ideas and
principles, and should cause no particular con-
cem.

Since that time, however, the American pub—
lic has been swung from one far-fetched and un—
sound scheme to another. Upton Sinclair was
the first when he won the gubernatorial nomina~
tion in California through the appeal of his “End
Poverty in California” plan, Hardly had this
died down when the entire country went wild
over Dr. Townsend‘s old age pension plan. No
sooner had the popularity of this Utopian scheme
begun to wane, than the postal authorities were
swamped with “End the depression” dime chain
letters.

Are we to interpret the wide-spread popular-.
ity which these high sounding plans have achiev-
ed as meaning that the people have reached such
depths of despair that they are ready to accept
the doctrines of anyone who promises to bring
them prosperity and security, no matter how uno
sound and illogical the idea may be? It is upon
this attitude of despair that the Fascist state in
Italy and the Nazi regime in Germany have been
founded,

With one of the most daring demagogues
of all time. Huey Long, now eying the presidential
campaign of 1936 on the platform of “Share the
Weal ," it is time that the American people took
themselves in hand and settled down to the sup-
port of sound policies. If a more sane attitude is
not adopted it is quite within the realm of possi-
bility for a Fascist, Communist or some other sort

Red Cross Swim Examiner
to Hold Tests Tomorrow

Walter Hausknecht, American Red
Cross examiner, will be in Grinnell
Thursday, Friday and Saturday, to
give the tests necessary for senior
life saver and examiner’s licenses,
according to Dave Malbrough, student
swimming manager.

Candidates will be examined at the
college pccl beginning at can o’clock
Thursday afternoon.

Hausknecht, a member of the sLaff

held several swimming championships
in Missouri during the past five years.
He was swimming director cf the

A SHABBY SITUATION

Each fall the college students begin their an-
nual shopping tours which extend through out the
entire school year. Most of these purchases—at
least a god share of themmare made via the credit
routeA‘bn the cuff”——in collegiate parlance.

However, the day of reckoning always ar-
rives and all debts must be settled, and it is at
this point that the difficulty arises. While the
students are quite willing to take advantage of
the credit facilities offered them, they are not as
quick to liquidate their obligations when the
time comes. The result is that the merchants are
beginning to feel that the college students do not
want to. cooperate in the matter of straightening
out financial matters. This year, more than ever,
the merchants are complaining of such angindif-
ferent attitude on the part of the students.

This state of affairs is one which will not tend
to promote generous cooperation between the stu-
dent body and the merchants. The merchants ex-
tended the credit to the collegians in good faith,
and a slow and infidderent regard for such obliga-
tions is but scant justice and a cheap way to re-
turn such a favor.

Unless the students wish to create the belief
among the merchants that collegians are a shabby
lot, a more rapid liquidation is necessary. And
now is the time to show the merchants of Grinnell
that their extension of Credit on liberal terms was
not a mistake, but that instead the students realize
the favor that has been extended to them and will
return it in kind by settling all obligations as soon
as possible. Only by such action on the part of
the student body, will the formation of a dis-
creditable reputation be averted.

Other Opinions

ABOUT POLITICS
(Daily O’Collcgian)
Father Coughlin and Huey Long seem determined to
get some sort cf a third party movement started for the
1936 presidential and congressional elections.

The Detroit priest has already tumed the National
Union for Social Justice into a political group and is
seeking the support of the masses by promulgating it pro.
gram by which he promises to drive "pluiccrats" out of
public office. We expect that it will he a long time
before a second William Jennings Bryan turns up and
that seems to be what Coughlin and Long are striving
for. We do not think people will fleck to the standards
of a radical of tcday, despite our present economic lieu.

moner.

Since the Republican party was formed and put up
its first presidential candidate in 1856 and its first suc.
cessful candidate in 1860 there have been no really suc.
cessful new party movements—raltllough Theodore Reese.
velt's Progre§sive party did carry a lot of votes in 1912
and served to cause the election of Woodrow Wilson. The
Socialists have been strong in Wisconsin under the
leadership of the Iah‘olletes.

Political conditions today are particularly interesting
and college students have a very good chance to get
in on the ground ﬂoor uf a new national political setup.
Whether a third party—most likely it Progressive party——
will arise or whether the change will come within the
bounds of one of the two major parties of today re.
mains to be seen.‘ Come what may, politics during
the coming years will grow in importance, especially
since more people are in government employ now than
ever before. Puliti- will fumish careers for many col.
lege students and the importance of politics cannot be
stressed too much, we think, in our higher institutions
of learning. .

We believe that the majority of students are in col.
lege either to prepare themselves to get a good job and
demand a sizeable salary or because it’s “the thing to
do." We do know that, on the whole, the American
student is not a serious minded, hard working student.

CHAPEL
NOTES

Monday

“One of the effects of biology," stat.
ed Dr. Henry S. Conal'd, professor of
botany, in chapel Monday, “is that it
makes people appreciate.the common
things; common things such as the
earthworm, wecds, the apple-blossom
and the primrose." -

He went on to say that the biologist
appreciates them because he under—
stands the complex structure, yet
simple beauty of these things.

“The main difference between a
machine and a living thing,” continued
Dr. Conard, “lies in the fact that the
machine is mammade and the living
thing builds itself. Therefore,” he
concluded, “one cannot get all of the
glory cl a flower unless he under.
stands the making of it.”

Tuesday

“The social structure one is born
into determines the mind," .7. o.
Stoops, professor cf philosophy, said
in chapel Tuesday. Looking back, he
recalled the time when soul was con.
sidered an individual part of self, cap.
able at being controlled by personal
manipulation.

Today the outlook, dominated by the
social sciences, is wholly changed.
How one is born is what counts. The
New Deal might be explained from
this standpoint as the national evolul
tion of a changed concept of person.

Co-eds to Make
Outdoor Setting
for Annual Fete

“Hansel and Gretel"_ will be the
theme of en outdoor May Fete to he
held on the campus between the we.
men’s and men's gymnasiums on May
22. in case of unfavorable weather it
will he held on the following evening.

The music for the pageant is taken
from the opera of the same name,
while the story has been altered and
enlarged to make it suitable for danc.
ing and pantomine. Music will be
furnished by an orchestra directed by
Chester Williams.

It is planned to transform the cam—
pus between the two gymnasiums into
an outdoor theater by using bushes
and shrubs to form the stage while
bleachers will be used to provide seats
for the audience.

The Pageantry and Festivals class
will be in charge of the production,
working under the direction of Clara
Julia Andersen, women’s director of
physical education. Members of the
class are making the costumes, plana
ning the lighting and will handle the
stage work on the night of the per.
formance. _

The Fete was formerly an annual
event among campus activities, but
was dropped three years ago. Last
year its place nn the college program
was filled by the swimming pageant.
