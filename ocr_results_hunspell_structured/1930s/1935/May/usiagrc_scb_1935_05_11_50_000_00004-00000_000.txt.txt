Professor Declares Dating
Importqnt in Student’s Life

Cedar Falls, la. (ACE—“Datingi
a social experience and one ot the
most important opportunities of Cullege
life," That‘s the definition given to
the popular collegiate activity by Dr,
Harold Boslcy, director of religious
activities at low State Teachers col.
legc.

Outlining the reasons tor dating, Dr.
Bosley declared students date because
it is a social habit, and because of a
desire ior companionship.

“Dating bureaus are psychologically
sound, although we may laugh at
them," Dr. Bosley said. “Dating bur.
eaus give students an opportunity for
social experiences which they might
not get otherwise."

Ann Arbor, Mich—(Acpl—lhere’s
a new sorority at the University of
Michigan, Sigma Sigma Phi, founded
by four Chinese students, Pearl Chen,
Lily Wang, Helen Vang, and Lilian
Wang.

The charter members are studying
education, medicine, public health and
sociology and eventually expect to re.
turn to china to aid in its rebuilding.
Most of them come irom families
which already exert considerable pol.—
itical and economic influence in their
local communities.

The sorority has been established as
a kind at social and inbellectual bond
for Chinese women in foreign schools,
and for the furtherance of the common
aim. Additional chapters are contem—
plated lor London and Shanghai.

John McMurrays parents from
Webster City are visiting him at
