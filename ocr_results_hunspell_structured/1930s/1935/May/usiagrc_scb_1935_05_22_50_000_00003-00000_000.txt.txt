ing staff and adequate facilities Ior re~
search and publicity.

In order to provide more adequate
facilities for the teaching of music,
drama and art, plans call for the es—
tablishment of the Grinnell Institute
of Fine Arts. It will provide adequate
equipment and an enlarged teaching
staff for these departments.

Extended Curriculum

The last phase of the expansion plan
includes the establishment of a curri—
culum for orientation and concentra—
tion. “In order that a student be pre-
pared for the responsibilities of life,
he must have two types of training:
orientation, a general understanding of
the civililation of our day; and con-
eentration a specific preparation for
actual life. Thc first of these requires
a new curriculum," President Nollen
states.

Courses contemplated for this curr—
iculum include: the Physical Universe.
The Making of MDdEI‘Il Civilization,
Problems of Citizenship, Studies of
Great Books, World Relations,Art Ap—
preciation, and Problems of Philoso-
phy and Religion.

By TED KLEIN

The end of the school year is almost
upon us, accompanied, as usual, by
the annual frantic effort to get work
in before the deadline, followed by a
period of intensive cramming for the
final exams. We certainly would be
the last to infer that a good deal of
that sort of thing is inevitable, if not
desirable. 0n the other hand, asteady
diet of any one activity to the cxclus.
ion'of all else is more fatiguing than
beneficial. We suggest that you relax

.a few hours each day by doing some
reading that will be refreshing and
recreative. The rental shclf at the
college library is full of books that
fall into that category.

THE MAN YHO HAD EVERYTHING
by Louis Broniiicld. This latest book
by the winner of the Pulitzer prize is
a character study. The central char-
acter, Tom Ashford, is a highly suc.
ccsslul playwright with plenty of
money, a fashionable wife two sons
whom he atomic.
ance with all the latest bright people.
He has arrived at this station in life
as the result of a consuming am—
bition, which had driven him from the
farm, where he grew up, to conquer
the big city. But his roots are still
9n the fan-n, and all he gets out of life
is a nervous breakdown. It is the
conﬂict between natural and artificial
life that provides Mr. Bromf-icld with
his subject matter.

This book decidedly does not meas.
ure up to the character of' Mr. Brom-
field’s best work. The author centers
the conflict in the character of Tom,
and then doesn’t provide any character
but a mere system of conventions and
labels. Nevertheless, the book- is in-
terestingly written in Mr. Dromfield's
graceful and often distinguished prose
style.

GnANDSON by Louis Atlantic.

Louis Adamic has written books in the

past that have particularly impressed

the reviewer with the fervor and
completeness of conviction which he
feels for or against his subject. Here
he has written a book about the prob.
lem of each American, namely, to
make a sensible living in a nonsensical
world. This is the story of two bro.
thers, Peter and Andy Gale, and their
cousin, lack, three young Americans
of today. Their grandfather, Anton
Gale, came to to the United States
sixty years before, an immigrant from
Comiola, and was killed in a Chicago
riot in 1886. Their grandmother was
part lndian, part Yankee. The father
of Peter and Andy was a small busi-
ness man, and lacks father was a
steel worker.

Peter Gale is the central character in
the narrative. He went to college,
fought in the war, was wounded, bev
came a newspaper man, was, by na-
ture, a poet and dreamer. When the
story opens he is at cross.purposcs
with himself and the world. He can't
seem to find his place in the world, nor
Andy’s or Jack’s. He sets out to write
a book about these three grandsons,
and the remainder of the book is de-
voted to his struggle to complete the
work.

As usual, Mr. Adamic writes a
story that is intensely real and inter-
esting The philosophy in it, while
pessimistic in the main, is certainly
stimulating. This is the kind of book
that you will want to read two or
three times before you have mentally
and spiritually digested it.

dent from Conrad, visited Bernard

the school are former Grinnellians.

Following his graduation in 1552,
Dr. White attended the Hartford and
Chicago theological scminarics and
Oxford university. Shortly after this
he left to join the staff of the Gree-
cian college.

The outbreak of the World War
disrupted the college work, and short—
ly after Mr. White saw the institution
destroyed as the contesting armies
fought for possessions of the straits
leading to the Black Sea.

ued to direct relief work, this time
from the sccnc of the devastation
near Marsovan, Turkey. He continu-
ed to do this until in 1924 when he
was invited by Premier Venezclos of
Greece to reestablish the college at
Salonica.

The reconstruction of the collogc
was difficult. old war barracks and
hospitals were used as buildings dur—
ing the work of reconstruction. Graci—
ually more and newer buildings were
added to the school, and as the equip—
ment increased so did the number of
students enrolled.

Today, the college consists of two
schools. The boys institution having
an enrollment of about 200 students
while the girl's school has about 100.
The classes are not very big, Dr.
whitc explained, ranging between so
and 75 students. In the graduating

class last year, there were 52 students.

Almost Flunlzs,
Then Mns Honors
in Graduate Work

From almost ilunking in a liberal
arts college to nation-wide scholastic
honor in graduate school is the
achievement of Bur-well Spurlock '30,
who just recently received the first
prize offered by the American institute
of Chemical engineers to the most out.
standing senior chemistry student in
the United States.

Spurlock during his senior year at
Grim-tell almost failed to pass the final
examination in his major field of
chemistry, after having displayed great
interest in the work during the pre.
vious three years, Deciding that chem-
istry was not his field, hc enrolled
in the Harvard law school, only to

withdraw at the end of the first year.

Being thus unable to definitely de-
eide upon his future, he returned to
his first love and enrolled at the Uni-
versity of Colorado at Boulder, Colo.,

 

 

where he took up graduatc work in
chemistry engineering. Now at the end
of his senior year there, he has been
given one of the highest chemical
awards in thc country, and in com.
petition with 400 other chemistry sen-

iors In addition to not only winning
this prize, be ranked first in his class
during the entire time there.

THE SUMJVEER VACATION
(AS We’d Like It To Be).

Long, long days of languidly drift—
ing down slow rivcrs, under drooping
frees, gazing into the eyes of a Hollya
woodishly Tarzancd Adonis. Strangc
sights, and stranger happenings. Tepid-
ly tropic days, and torridly amorous
nights. A t'n‘iplc moon coycring its
shocked head by a palm trcc.

(As Wc Tell The Room-mate About It)

A swanky summer resort, zipping
motor boats, parked cars, how-de-ow~
dow jazz orchestras. Battling-suited
