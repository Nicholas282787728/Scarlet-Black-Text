FINIS

It is with both relief and regret that we, the
retiring management of The Scarlet and Black,
write finis to our administration with today’s
issue. Just a year ago our hopes were high and
our plans for the future were very ambitious—
perhaps too ambitious. Looking back over the
past year we can see comparatively few ways in
which we succeeded in living up to our aspira~
tions and many ways in which we have failed.
We’ve made a few enemies, we know, but we
have, it is our hope, made many more friends.

We devised no ambitious platform at the be-
ginning of our regime, thus saving ourselves any
possible embarrassment from failure to attain
predetermined aims. It was our intent to co—
operate in all campus projects which seemed to
us worthy and to oppose those which did not
to the Very limited extent did we proclaim any
program.

There is an episode or two which occurred
during our first stumbling weeks in office that we
recall with regret, and we have been guilty of
occasional slips during the current year which we
would like to disclaim if we could. We hope that
these unintentional errors have been forgiven, as
the products of inexperience, and forgotten

But it is the privilege of the outgoing editor
to dwell upon his accomplishments, so we shall
simply pause to offer a lump apology to all whom
we have offended during the year and hurry
on to more pleasant considerations.

In the matter of news content and features,
the present management of the paper offered the
following innovations: complete, or near-complete
coverage of all Grinnell football games on the
same day as they were played; the Collegiate
Digest and other features provided by the As-
sociated Collegiate Press association; 3 backre-
view column.

Wherein the editorial policy of the paper‘was»
concerned we supported and helped in bringing
success to the following projects—some of which
were comparatively unimportant, while we hope
that others will prove a real contribution to the
school: abandonment of unnecessary campus
organizations and class officers; general use of
proper names of the women’s cottages; abolition
of freshman hazing; provision‘of funds for award-
ing of this year’s Henry York Steiner Memorial
Prizes in essay writing and graphic arts.

’Just recently a prominent Iowa editor classified

the artificial restraints upon free investigation of

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

This is not an imposing list, we grant, but we
had no desire to win a name as a crusader. While
conducting an occasional editorial campaign, it
was our primary interest to discuss local prob-
lems and to explain and interpret incidents of
national and international import to the best abil-
ity of our editorial board.

In turning over the reigns to the incoming
editor we wish to make a plea in his behalf. Re-
member that The Scarlet and Black is but a
training ground for Grinnell‘s budding journalism.
The readers are justified in demanding conscien-
tious work, but,should not expect the polished
work of a professional newspaper. Most of the
staff members are inexperienced, and am ition
alone cannot turn out a perfect piece of writing-

We are sure that the new heads of the paper
will prove themselves able, sincere and anxious to
please, and we wish them the best of luck in their
venture.

WHAT IS THE GAIN?

Another “red scare” has developed recently,
this time in a series of charges against the Uni-
versity of Chicago alleging that radical doctrines
are being taught there. So rapidly have these
allegations and investigations of radicalism de.
veloped that it is getting to be a fad to hurl them.

Columbia and Iowa university as being among
the schook which permitted the
great freedom to engage in radical tendencies.
In addition the state legislature of New York and
Iowa have had under consideration proposals to
force students and professors respectively to take
oaths to support the Constitution Now comes
the present series of charges hurled against Chi;
cago, one of the outstanding graduate schools of
the country.

One is a trifle bewildered as to the cause for
the hue and cry. Granted that there may be a
danger to the government, still the mere dis-
Cussion and investigation of other doctrines, per-
haps not exactly the same as those now in prac.
tice, does not seem to warrant the hurling of
charges, the demands for investigations, and the
efforts to gain absolute conformance to the pre-
sent conditions

It does not seem feasible to believe that col-
lege students are so gullible as to be readily in-
noculated with radical doctrines. They are
young men and women, capable of thinking for
themselves, and merely because they are given
the opportunity by college authorities to hear the
various doctrines and to make their own decisions,
is no adequate reason for hurling forth blasts of
denunciation.

Neither does this seem to be sufficient rea-
son for attempting to prevent the investigation by
students and the teaching of doctrines which may
differ from those mnst commonly accepted. This
sort of educational control has been attempted be-
fore, but in all cases where there was a real
need for any changes in the social organization,

doctrines and thought in educational institutions
failed utterly to check the trend of the times. In
the middle~years of the last century, there was
just such an attempt with the resulting epidemic
of revolutions which protested against this and
other restrictions.

Obviously such a repression can hope to ac-
complish little, and if the college students of this
generation are not capable of properly evaluating
the respective meriu of various doctrines no mat-
ter how radical, certainly there is something
wrong with the educational system. Instead of
bewailing the so-called teaching of radical doc-
trines in various institutions of higher learning,
why not try and discover how damaging such in-
vestigation on the part of the students is, and if
proper evaluation is lacking, then remedy the ed-
ucational system so that men and women will
be properly trained to judge various doctrines for
themselves. It is foolish to believe that the stu-
dent can continue through life with a group of
self-appointed censors telling what to believe and
what not to. Rather, individual thought and
evaluation must be developed, and it will not
come as the result of hurling unjustified charges
of Communism and radicalism, at the educational
institutions of the country. —M. H.
