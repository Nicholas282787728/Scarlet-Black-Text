Spider Tea Newest Drink
on Diet of Ohio Professor

TOLEDO, ohio (Acpt—Spider tea
made its way into a professor's diet
here recently, when Dr. Howard H.
M. Bowman, professor of biology at
the University of Toledo. drank a cup
of tea in which a dead spider had been
placed.

It wasn't the rare flavor which at.
tracted Professor Bowman’s attention,
but rather he sought to prove on the
witness stand in a law suit that the
mere presence of a spider in a cup of
tea had no injurious effects. Professor
Bowman suffered no ill effecb, the
point was proved and the law suit won,

By more scientific means, Professor
Bowman has helped solve several
other legal disputes. In one case, by
using the precipitated test, a sub.
stantiation of the theory of evolution,
he proved ’that blood stains were of
human origin and not of goat’s blood,
as the defentants asserted. The re.
sult was the conviction of a murderer.

Difﬁculties of Chemistry
Revealed by Investigation

AMES, lat. (ACE—Beginning chem.
istry, the bane of college students the
country over, has been subjected to
a thorough investigation by Prof. F. E.
Brown, of Iowa State college, and he
has discovered there are four major
sources from which difficulties arise.

The subject, the student, the advice
the student receives, and the teaching
itself are all responsible, Prof. Brow-n
claims. In discussing the nature of
the subject, he declares, “It is exactv
blulling, guessing and opinions are
useless. The inclusion of so much
material in beginning courses is at.
so a detriment."

General educational theories, ad.
vice of older students, and the teach.
ing difficulties involved must share
the blame, Professor Brown feels, In
addition, the attitude of the student
can and should be changed toward the
subiect, he asserts,
