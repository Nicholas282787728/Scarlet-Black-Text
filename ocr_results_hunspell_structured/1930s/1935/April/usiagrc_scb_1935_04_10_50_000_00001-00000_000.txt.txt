Here’s How to Acquire Gallantry,
Ye Would-Be Gentlemen of Grinnell

Characteristics Most Admired
by Co-eds Exposed
by Miss Osborne

Having spent her time in Grinnell
thus far in revealing to the co.eds the
finer points of charm, Elizabeth Mac.
Donald Osborne, consultant on per.
sonal appearance, was apprehended
last night by the writer and urged to
spare a few words for the poor be.
nighted gentlemen on the campus.

We say "consultant on personal ap.
penrance” because she announced that
from past experience she had learned
that She had to provide all reporters
with some such title or they would
create one themselves—which more
often than not was highly unsatisfac.

a style expert," She declared some.

stricken, having employed that term in
referring to her beretofor.

Men nave Advantage

“The men are fortunate." she said.
“that their style of dress is so much on
the order oi a uniform, as that elim—
inates the possibility oi most oi the
tfaul's in dressing which it is so easy
for the girls to fall into." Not being
obligated to "make upll‘thcy are freed
from this problem which forever faces
a girl, and their simplicity of dress
leaves only the matter of tying their
ties and general neatness to consider.

Questioned as to what general char.

with gallantry equivalent to the charm
which a girl is expected to exhibit.
the purveyor of pleasing personalities
said, “Thercarc four or five things

the girls during my conferences with

Duke to Hold
Track Trials

Will Select Relay Carnival
Entries Saturday

in 3 var.

Trials to select the runners to com.
pate at the Kansas and the lowa State
Teachers relays, to be held April 20,
will be held Friday and Saturday of
this week, according to Lester Duke.
track coach.

These trials will be run all if the
weather permits and will replace the
annual home track meet which was
originally scheduled for Saturday. This
annual meet has been postponed in.
definitely, Duke said yesterday, and
may or may not be run later in the
season. This action was taken be.
cause of the inability of many of the
men who are reporting for spring loot.
ball to get info condition for the meet,
and becauso'it was felt that more
could be accomplished by individual
trials preceding the later meek.

It is not certain whether or not
Grim-tell will enter any men in the
Kansas relays, Duke stated yesterday.
Hawever, if Grinnell enters, it is cer—
tain that only the mile relay team
will Compete. “I feel that this relay
team would have a good chance of
placing, but due to the bad weather,
which has prevented the men irom
getting into condition, our chances
would probably be reduced." Duke
asserted.

if there are no entries made in
the Kansas meet, the entire squad may
be entered in the Iowa State Teachers
invitational meet at Cedar Falls.
With Grinnell sending a full Squad the
Pioneer runners would have a good
chance of winning Several relays, ac.
cording to Duke.

Courtesy Expected Vnrit-s

The type and degree of courtesy ex.
pected by girls in various parts of
the country varies widely, Miss 0s.
home has found. In the south, she
remarked. the girls demand more at.
tention than those in any other part
of the country, while on the west
coast the young women usually insist
on their relations being more on a
fiftyaiihy basis and demand more
social independence.

She assured the writer that it was
by no means the first time She had
been asked to' offer pointers for men.
“I sometimes feel,” she said, “that I
should develop a series of lectures ex.
pressly for men. She stated that men
frequently attend her lectures, when
she is brough‘. to a campus in the in.
terest of the whole SLhOOl, and quite
frequently seek conferences.
