JUNIOR COLLEGES.

No type of institution has had such a mushroom
growth in Iowa the past few years as has the junior
college. Offering to high school seniors the chance to
take their first two years of college work at home,
the junior college has made it possible for many to
have some college work who otherwise could never
have afforded to continue their studies. Nevertheless,
many students attend junior colleges today who could
afford to lake four years at a liberal arts school,
such as Grinnell, but who are forced to stay home be-
cause it is necessary to support “a home town Insti—
tution" or because their parents fear to let them
escape from underneath the protecting shelter
of home, This is the regrettable feature of the junior
college—that it should prevent young men and women
with great possibilities from spending their entire col—
legiate career at a fine liberal arts school, whose
broadening influences the junior college can not hope
to- match.

From the time they enroll as freshmen Crinnell
offers its students intellectual surroundings and high
quality instruction which tend to widen the knowledge
of the student and stimulate him to subject every—
thing he does to processes of reason. It can do this
because it has professors with years of experience and
training, with the supplementary influences o! a large
library. It will be able to do so increasingly in the
future. with the addition of a million and a half dol-

college has not been able to parallel in any way the
high-quality intellectual surroundings of Grinuell.

dred volumes are all right as far as they go, but c

 

they really go as far toward putting the student 1
line with widening lines of thinking as can Gr‘innell?
Intellectual development is not the only advantage
that Grinnell holds over the junior colleges of the
state The individual who enrolls here as a freshman
rather than staying at home to attend school is thrown
on his own initiativeea process which cannot fail
to make him a bigger man. Study he must, or fail;
there is no one to compel him to work. If the group
of men he lives with represents, many different types,
he experiences the highly-important process of lean»-
mg to adjust himself to social contacts with different
types, He learns how to conduct himself as a gentle-
man with the opposite sexiGrinnell’s Social life by-
long been one of her most attractive features '
Through over twenty student organizations he may
find opportunity for the expression of his interests, as
they gradually widcn, All these require the use of
personal initiative; all are situations met in more
challenging fashion at Grinnell than in the Junior college
They are situations that develop one for the problems
of life: therefore, it is highly valuable that a student
who is able to should come to such a liberal arts
school as Grinnell in his freshman, not his junior year.

The success of Grinnell in the recent endowment ,

campaign has'been made the occaSIon for a great deal
of comment. It opens to Grinnell the chance to offer
even highcr standards of instruction in a wider range
or subjects in the future. Hence, it cannot fail to
bring home to the serious high school graduate intend-
ing furLller study the essential fact of this whole edir
tolihl—that Grinnell offcrs opportunities and has
facilities for the widening and deepening of the SUP
dent's life that no junior college can offer. That is
why the future of the liberal arts college, and the
future of Grinnell is assured.

THAT TEACHING POSITION.

n census of what college graduates intend to do
immediately after commencement would doubtless show
a majority planning to teach. But we are constantly
being reminded of the scar-city of positions, of the
necessity for the applicant to be a jack~ofrall—trades,l
capable of teaching anything from public speaking to'
manual training, and seldom do these doleful pro-g
phecies offer a suggestion regarding the solution of,
this problem. l

During the past vacation several Crinnell seniors
planning to teach interviewed various school super-
intendents. In all cases they found little demand for
their majors and always the requirement that they
teach several other subjects of which they had no
knowledge.

This condition which, we are informed, is not at
all uncommon, somewhat parallels the problem of}
placement bureaus. They are constantly faced with
inadequately prepared college seniors trying to find
positions. These would-be teachers present a hopeless
conglomeration of subjects which they have studied
during their college courses. None of these subjects
can be grouped to form a working basis for a teaching
position. They seem to indicate either that the student
has had no objective toward which to point his college
work and for that reason has carried fillers and snap
courses or that the student has had insufficient direc-
tion in his registration.

The semi-annual college registration is upon uS.
we believe and recommend that before registering the
student should carefully consider why he is choosing
his particular courses and whether or not they suggest
any possible eta-ordination,

Payne. The speaker pointed out
that with no forces, no ﬁnances and
no administrative body of its own,
the League is not a superrstate, that
it cannot interfere in internal af-
fairs of a nation and that it cannot
order any nation to call out military
forces to aid the League.
Maintains Peace

“What the League is”, affirmed
Professor Payne, ” is an association
of fifty-four nations to maintain
peace, promote cooperation and und-
erstanding among the nations, a
body which attempts to prevent war
by conciliation, arbitration and the
use of the World court. General
