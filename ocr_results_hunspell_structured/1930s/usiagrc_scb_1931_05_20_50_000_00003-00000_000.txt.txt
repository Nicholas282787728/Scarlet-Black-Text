Tatom Loses Intercollegiate
Tennis Finals in Chicago
Meet by Default Saturday

After winning his way into the fin—
als of the Central Intercollegiate
tennis meet in Chicago Saturday,
John Tatom, ace of the Pioneer tennis
team, was the victim of unfortunate
circumstances, and was forced to de—
fault his match.

Scheduled to play Tietjen, Washing-
ton university number two man in
the ﬁnals, Tatom understood that the
match would be played at 2 pm.
Upon arriving at the courts, he was
notiﬁed that the match was plannedi
at 11 am. and he was forced to de»
fault. ~Brody and Jensen of Drake,
who had battled their way to the
doubles ﬁnals, were also forced to
forteit their matches for the same un-
derstanding.

Tatom will compete in the Missouri

end at Omaha where he may get an-
other chance to meet Tietjen. Frank
Davis will probably be the other Grin-
nell representative, The dual meet
with Drake yesterday was postponed.
