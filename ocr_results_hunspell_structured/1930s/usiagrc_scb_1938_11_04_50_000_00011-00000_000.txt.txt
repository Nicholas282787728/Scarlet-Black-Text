House Presidents
Ask Pre-Law Club
To Gather Details

That all men of Gi-innell may be
fingerrprinted was a possibility
today when the Council of House
presidents, men's governing body,
sent ‘such a request to the Fre
Law club to investigate the de-
tails in undertaking the work.

The prints would be taken {01‘
identification only and would he
kept in a civil file.

Whether this measure is to be
compulsory or voluntary has not
yet been decided. '

Viewing the enthusiasm by the
student body last year when a G-
man of the Omaha, Neh. branch
oi' the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, spoke here last year, the
Pre Law club has arranged for a
representative of the F.B.I, tot
speak here Nov. 21.

tion, Cooper asked to see Miss
Gee at the Blackstone hotel where
they sat in the lobby and talked
about Grinnell for about 20 min-
lites.

Cooper Unrecognized.

No one in the lobby recognized
Cooper. He asked Miss Gee about
several members of ,the faculty
and inquired about Langan hall,
the building he lived in while at»
tending Grinncll in the early
1520's.

“Is Gi-innell as beautiful this
tall as it usually is at this time
of the year?” was one of the
questions he asked Miss Gee.
Mrs. Hensley Attends.

Accompanying Miss Gee on the
visit with Cooper was Mrs. Eliza-
beth Hensley, housemother in
James cottage, Mr. and Mrs. Ma-
,chin Gardner, Grinnell representa-
tives in lllinois, and William
Crouch, publicity agent and form-
er Grinnell student.

Cooper said that while at Grins
men he had Greek at 3 am, Span-
ish at 9 am. and English at in
a.rn., all of which caused him to
get them mixed up because they
all came at once.

Ignores Reporters.

Crouch introduced Miss Gee to
Cooper and the actor ignored re-
poiters who wanted interviews so
that he could talk with Miss Gee.

United Artists studio presented
Miss Gee with an orchid and Mrs.
Hensley with a gardenia corsage.

While in Chicago, the two Grina
nell representatives dined at the
Palmer House and spent the art-
ernoon riding and resting.

They returned to the campus at
11:45 pm. Wednesday.

pert dramatists, but the players
last night struggled valiantly
with a slow first act and some
stupid dialogue, making the most
of minor characterizations and
working up to an amusing and
dramatic close.
Thinnhnail Characterizations.

Flora Jayne stroebele, Robert
Hagan and Browne Barr handled
well long and in many ways 1m-
grateful roles; the high points of
the evening were the thumbnail
characterizations of Marge 3002,
Beth Pennock and Mary Whet-
stone.

Ruth Schulte played the part of
Mrs. Shaw sympathetically and in
a more convincing fashion than is

as old people. Might 1 add the
prophecy that Betty Ley will bear
watching; she achieved moments
of tragic intensity in a role that
the authors made melodramatic
rather than dramatic, She did
that, too, under the handicap of
comparison with Andrea Leeds'
remarkable screen performance.
Applause a Tribute.

The applause oi last night's
audience was a just tribute to the
enthusiasm and spirit with which
the large and for the most part
inexperienced cast, under the di-
rection of Sara Sherman Pryor,
worked together to w rig the last
laugh and the last tear from a
play that contained everything,
as the saying goes, but the kitch-
en stove.

We may be permitted a regret
that the authors did not write a
better play; but we must praise
the group of actors who, faced
with the manifold faults of “Stage
Door,“ still succeeded in holding
for three hours the rapt attention
of their audience.
