is something in human nature that justifies tllis
optimism whith goes deepcl than Pollyanna s

pacific substitute for war he thought to find it ill

and pelilous occupations of our ci ation. What
ever “9 lnav think of the old theory of foilnal
discipline thlough difficult or distasteful study,
there is no doubt that haldship has a pedagogical

value and a natural appeal to healtlly minds and
bodies. The football field is a good symbol of this
solid human fact

The distiesses and disappointments through
which all the “011d has been passing for almost
three y-eais are not such as lie sllould lime chosen;
thele ale too many millions of innocent and help-

youth of tlle land and so to contribute to the

and earthquake and fire of destmictive War Wild
speculation and crazy spending are illelcit‘ully

LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE

What will the student, who says he cannot
affoid to come to college because of the culrcllt
economic situation, do if he does not come? Unless
he has steady employment will not his living ex-
penses be a tremendous burden to the family? if
he waits until the depression lifts befmc coming to

Many Freshmen
to Have Brothers
and Sisters Here

Exactly 19 members of the incom-
ing class will have been preceded al-
ready by approximately 10 brothers
and sisters here at Grinnell, while
exactly 19 more new students will
come who will have the more or less
dubious advantage of having a brotllr
er or sister in school at the present
time.

No attempt has been made to iri-
clude the pairs of brothers or sisters
who will start to school together, but
records have been obtained showing
that there will be an unusually large
number of “relatives” on hand Sepr
ternber 20.

Another Head-Waiter?

Another Trumbull and another Van
Nostrand will make their appear-
ances, while there is a possibility
that there will alo be another Straw
icy. “Killer" Brown, the flaming-
baired terror of last year’s freshman
class, will have a brother, Richard,
to keep him company. instead of one
Trigg, Griunell will now have two
favorite sons of Great Falls, Mun»
tana.

Nate strewn, brother of John, is
getting a head start on the rest by
taking work in summer school, but
of Course that does not elevate him
out of the freshman class. Lloyd Ad-
kins, brother of Wilma; Don Arnold,
brother of wiley; Vera Ashbaugh,
Voila-s sister (not. a typographical
error); Ethel Bybee, Lyman’s sister;
Doris Crabb, sister of Ruth; lane
Hackett, sister of Mary; Jack Hat~
field, who claims Don as a relation;
Thelma Huber, sister of Bernard, in-
cidentally a niece of Mr. Wehrhan's;
Kathryn Paul, Doris’s sister; Esther
Peek, sister or Frances and Kathleen

Peck, sister of Ruth (we hope we.

got it straight); Sheldon Walker,
brother of Elizabeth; and Bob Whyte,
who is a brother of-Betty Pojman,
nee Whyte, are all coming to Grin—
nell.
New students “Carry On"

David Bair, Ruth Goodenow, Mar-
guerite McFarlin.
Millan, Esther Collette, and Roberta
Vance were all graduated in June.

Just A
Sincere Wish

That you are having

the most enjoyable
summer. We look
forward to your re-
turn.

New students — it
will take hilt a short
time to discover that
JOE’S is 'lhe place
where s t 11 (l e n t s
gather. Just good old
college friendship.

lbut next fall students may be sure

prised to find a more youthful mem-
ber of these same families in school.
Camilla Burrows, ’31, will have two
brothers entering in the fall, Parke,
and John, who is transferring from
Amherst college. Then among the
new students who have had brothers
or sisters at Gl'innell in years gone
by are: Dorothy Brownbridge, Ran-
dolph Carlson, Robert Gillespie, Ade-
lih Ridgaway, Gretchen saam. Jean
Smith, William Taggert, Bertha
West, Ruth Mabel Wollenweber, and
William Shields.

Since the summer ls only half gone,
this list will no doubt be swelled by
the time school starts.
