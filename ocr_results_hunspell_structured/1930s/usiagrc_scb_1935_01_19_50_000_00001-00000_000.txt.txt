Playing of ’Cello
Recitalist Given
Praise by Critic

By H. w. MATLACK

The essential nobility and aristo.
cratic lineage oi the violincello were
admirably demonstrated in the recital
be Emanuel Feuermanu and Fritz
Kitzinger given at Herrick chapel
Thursday evening. The artists pre.
sented a program whose oustanding
character was its dignity, never once
ialling into a ‘moment oi trivial ex.
pression, and gave it all with a minute
appreciation of detail woven into a
unity of musical meaning which in
every measure that was played re.
vealed the signature of great music.
ianship.

in my recollection there has been
but one ’cellist whose instrument al.
ways sang with the clear purc tones
that Feuermann evoked, and that was
Pablo Casals. Generally there seems
to be a hive oi bumble.bccs in every
violincello. Rare indeed is the 'ccllist
who can keep from stirring them up
and getting a lot oi buzzing mixed up
with his tunes. Feuermann’s ’cello had
no bumblebee: in it; every tone was
a luminous and sharply.deiined vi.
brant stream of sound, and whether
he played loud or solt is perfect
musical quality was always its most
vivid feature.

masterpieces, every one; they
were the accompaniments not merely
of a pianist but oi a musician. Mr.
Kitzinger is an orchestral conductor,
among his other achievements, and his
piano playing shows it

Grinnell Loses Loop Lead
as Late Rally Fails
to Catch Visitors

By RALPH GLIDDEN

Unable to overcome the jinx oi 1:;
previous defeats at the hands oi
Creighton, Grinnell dropped a hard.
iought basketball game to Creighton,
29 to 32, here last night.

After changing hands several times
at the start of the game, the lead iin.
ally went to Creighton midway in the
first period. and the Jays successfully
defended it [or the rest of the game.
Battling desperately, the Pioneers con.
stantly threatened to regain the ad.
vantage, but the tall Bluejays wen:
able to scam consistently when press.

Jays Snatch Lead

Engelbretson, Jay lorward, gavc
Creighton a one point lead at the
start with a tree throw) but Erye and
Mason quickly duplicated his feat to
put the Pioneers in l-ront. Engsl.
bretson and Trish then sank short
field goals, and Mason retaliated by
dribbling in for a Set—up, following;
which Bauer tipped the hall in attcr
a pass from Du Mont under the basket.
The lead see—sawed until Creighton
gained an s to 9 advantage, which
they increased to 14 to 17 at the half.

Scoring seven points before Grin.
nell counted. Creighton increased their
advantagc of 10 points in the second
period. Pioneer otter-ope at a rally
reduced this to three points but stall.
ing tactics by Creighton. with McIvCl-
contributing a long iield goal and
two charity losses near the end put
the game in the bag ior the Blilcjays,

Short Shots Frequent

Both teams worked the ball under
the basket. for frequent short shoLS.

the aggressive manic-man defenses.
Except. for occasional stalling by
Creighton near the end, play‘ranged
iierccly over the floor throughout the
game. Fast breaking as the ball

both sides to shake men loose for set—
