Why is it that when any all-dorm-
itory sports team is selected the
judges pay more attention to allot-
ing the positions fairly evenly among
the halls, rather than picking the
best men for the places. though the
whole team might come from one
hall? That is a problem which has
made itself present in years past, and
the same thing certainly was evident
today in the meeting of six intra-
mural baseball authorities, who nam-
ed the 1530 all-dormitory team.

It is customary to disregard posiv
tions, when picking all-teams, in the
hopes of obtaining stronger aggrega-
tions. One all-Big Ten basketball
team of the past season was an ex»
ample of the disregarding of posi-
tions. Four of the -five all-team
players were centers on their re-
spective quints.

Six Judges.

All-dormitory indoor baseball
teams in the past have had two pit-
chers and two catchers on both the
first and second groups, and the two
teams named by The Grinnell Scar-
let and Black today, through the
aid of Coaches Watt, Duke and
Truesdale. and Lowell Fuller, intra-
mural manager. Art Cox and Tom
Carley. consequently mention two
men for each of these berths on both
teams.

The positions on the first and sec-
ond teams that carried little argu-
ment were those of pitcher and catch-
er. Russ Ruff of Building Three and
Andy Arent of Clark hall were
awarded the berths on the first
string. Ruff undoubtedly controlled
the ball better than any other pitch-
er of the dorm league, while Arent
qualified for the rival position by be-
ing able to supply plenty of steam
when putting the ovl echoes the
plate.

Graeber Good

Julius Grneber of Clark hall and
Chuck Woody of Building Three are
placed at the two catcher posts on
the first all-dorm team of The Scare
let and Black. Graeber, in his three
years at Grinnell, has distinguished
himself as a baseball player at the
position behind the plate. whether
the style of game happens to be in
door or outdoor.

Grinnell's tennis captain, Jibby
Jones, is named pt first base. Jones
was a sure catcher at first, and in
the play-off that will come with
Building Three, he will be an import-
ant part of Langan's hopes for the
cup. Dibble hall copped two posi-
tions on the first string in the pen

son of Bobby DeLong at second and
Johnny (Tilrlen) Tatom at right
short—stop. The left shortstop post
is awarded to Myron Pilbrow of Lan-
gan.

Burt Murray of the Clark hall
outfit deserves the third base posi»
tion. In the field are placed an are
ray of stars. Paul Edman is given
left field, George Robinson of Smith
gained the only first team mention
for his hall at center tield, and
Steve Kukolich, the Gates man who
scored the first two runs for Build-
ing Four in its exciting is encountr
er with Building Three, is rightfully
placed at right field.

Gates, Dibble Place Three Each

Gates and Dibble both place three
men on the second all-dormitory sc-
lections. Sewcll Sweeney at first
base. Don Bl'odiue at right short-
stop, and Louis Wolfe at left field
are Gates representatives. while
Dibble places Dewitt (Scotch) Mc-
Creary at third base, Eddie Brown
at one of the two catching posts, and
Harold (Kike) Wilhelm at one of the
pitching berths. Ernie McIntire of
Building Three is named at second
base. Clarence (Snap) James of Lan—
gan at left shortstop, Dick Murphy
of Building Three at center field,
Lowell Walker of Clark hall at right
field, Sheppard Taylor of Smith at
catcher, and Charles Briggs of Lan-
gsn at pitcher. These six conclude
the personnel of the second all-Gore
mitory mythical team.

In the games that are yet to come,
the scheduled game between Smith
and Gates, and the play-off for the
cup between Langan and Building
Three, one will have a chance to see
the best of the dorm players in ac-
tion, as well as the majority of the
all-dorm men named by The Scarlet
and Black today.

‘Mussolini Means

Much ,to Italy,’
Declares Spencer

"The country of Italy has an area
twice that of Iowa and a population
which is one-third of the total popu-
lation of the United States." remark-
ed Prof. E. B. T. Spencer, head or
the Gﬁnne‘ll Greek department, in
addressing the Cosmopolitan club in
the associations building last night
on the subject of “Italy."

Mr. Spencer stressed that the
country of Italy is not today as most
people consider it, that is like it
was in the days of Caesar and Cicero,
but it has its pine trees, its hills, just
like the states of Iowa and Missouri.
The American tourist in Italy finds
it difficult to be understood, when
speaking in Italian, because the peo-
ple there are very exact about pro-
nouncing tnelanguage. and seldom
are able to get the meaning or the
implication of the words that the
average American endeavors to
pronounce.

Italy has no educational back-
ground, and was unstable in govern-
ment until Benito Mussolini gained
control of it. At one time Italy bad
thirteen political parties and no edue
cation in politics, It was after the
World war that Mussolini rescued
Italy from the turmoil of unrest and
unhappiness, which resulted from the
return of the troops. Mussolini has
provided industry and security,
while perhaps not much liberty. and
has made the unemployed disregard
the importance of wages and get to
work.

An open forum discussion followed
Professor Spencer's talk.

Itice Players Goad

Rice Institute bowed to Grinnell
last spring. but reports this season
that in Jake Hess and Norman
Schwarz it has two men whose hard
driving games will likely carry Rice
to second place in their conference,
ﬁrst place being conceded to Texas.
Tulane, the last of the SChoolS to
announce its lineup for the coming
net season .and winner over Grin—
nell last year. has two outstanding
men in Clifford Sutter and Maurice
Rayon. The former is Southern
Conference singles champion. and
the latter was runner-up in the
tourney last spring. Paired in the
doubles, they annexed the conference
title and during the summer won
the FAStem Inter-Collegiate dou—
bles cup.

Two Places Open

As the \‘egular season gets under
way shortly after the net duo re-
turn from the south, and a four men
team will be used in all regular
