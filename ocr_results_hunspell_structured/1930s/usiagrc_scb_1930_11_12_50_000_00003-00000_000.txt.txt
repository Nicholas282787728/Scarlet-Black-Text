f Campus Opinion 3
We;

Do you approx-e the addition of Flir
day to the Thanksgiving holiday?

Esther Collette: Yes. Thanksgiv-
ing makes a logical division in the
school year when many students
would like to go home.

Elizabeth Hatch: Yes. If Friday is
added, students living quite a dis—
lance from Gl'irmeil will have an 013*
portunity to go home.

Jane Lewis: Freshmen need a
break in the pre-hoiiday grind even
more than upper classmeu,

Roberta anlce: Yes, it is film for
those who live close enough to go
home, and it gives the others a
chance to enjoy themselves

Marion Johnson: Yes. everyone
and especially the freshmen need a
vacation before going on with the rest
of the semester's work.

James Clark: Friday recess after
Thanksgiving Should be definitely es-
tablished on the college calender.

Donald Rove: Friday as a port of
the Thanksgiving holiday gives many
students the chance to get home at
least once before UJB Christmas va-

cation. .
