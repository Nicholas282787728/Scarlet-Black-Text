Freshmen Issue Challenge
to Sophomores

The freshmamsophomore tug of
war, last hold in 1932, will be re-
Vived for the first time Friday
afternoon at 4:30 o'clock when
the men of the two classes clash
at the Country club.

Members of the freshman class
have issued a challenge to the
members of the sophomore class,
which has been accepted, accord-
ing to Robert Barry, president DI
the class.

“We want all the sophomores
to be out there and take part," he
clared last night, “for we are 30*
ing to do our best to will.”

Members of the freshman class
are equally determined to pull
their upperclass o p p o n e n t s
through the mud of the pond, and
the odds favor the new men, due
to a superiority of numbers. There
are 152 freshmen enrolled in
school, in comparison with 122
men in the sophomore class, give
ing the new men a numerical su-
periority of so.
