Grinnell Ranks High

Among Institutions
With Intramurals

By Edward L. Wilson.

“An activity for every man, and
every man in an activity." That
is the expression used by John C.
Truesdale, director of athletics at
Grinnell, to describe his interest in
physical education in general and
in Gi-innell in particular,

“Tritc or unoriginal as it may
be." he explained, "it is none the
less the most applicable to our
ideal."

95 Pel- Ceiit Participate.

From his office in the men's
gymnasium. Truesdale heads a de-
partment which has a record of
almost 95 per cent of all the men
in college actively participating in
athletics. Those not absorbed in
varsity competition are included in
the intramural program, according
to Truesdale.

Truesdale, professor of physical
education, came to Grime]! in
1927 from Union High school in
Grand Rapids, Mich. I—lis intense
interest in having athletics reach
everybody comes, he says, from
his work in the Grand Rapids park
system as assistant superintendent
of recreation

Compares Favorably.

"Grinnell compares favorably
with other institutions of higher
learning in its intramural pro-
gram," Truesdale stated.

"For my master’s degree, I am
writing a thesis entitled, ’Some
Trends in Organization and Ad-
ministration of Intramural Athlet—
ics in 32 American Colleges and
Universities,’ and in comparison
with the reports I have gathered
irom various places, Grinnell is
very successful in its program."
\Vorks on Degree.

Truesdale is working for his
higher degree at the University of
Iowa during summer vacations.
Commenting on the high figures
of the record of students who are
active in intramural athletics, he
said the percentage probably would
be still higher it a closer check
were made. He said that there
are some men who never partici-
pate in intramurals because they
spend the whole of their college
time playing on the freshman and
varsity squads.

"There are some few who are
physically unable to compete," he
continued. “This would bring the
total of possible actives up a tewl
points higher and we imagine it
would be about as close to our
goal as we could hope fur.”

where our space is very limited for
most activities.

”More time is needed, [00,” he
continued, "in order that a mem-
ber of the atbletic department be
able to help administer the en-
larged program efficiently."

Asked whether there was a
Crinnell intramural handbook,
part of the basis for judging the
program, 'I‘ruesdﬁle said that there
was. “We haven't revised it re-
cently to keep pace with our pro-
gram," he said, "but we are plan-
ning a new edition for next
spring.”

Coach Truesdale, although satis»
fied in many ways with the pres-
ent intramural program at Grim
ncll, expressed a desire to improve
and expand its present effective-
ness by reaching every man in
school.
