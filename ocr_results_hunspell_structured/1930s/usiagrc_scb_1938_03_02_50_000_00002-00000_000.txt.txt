heck, Ted Appelquist and Burke

the hurdles and shot. the dash,
and possihly the mile.

Schlotterbeck. middle distance
star. will compete in the special
sou-yd. race, and possibly in the
special moo-yd. run. In the

scoring.

the aoo-yd. event, Schlntterbeek
will run the Loco-yd race. In ad-
dition. Ted Appelquist will com-
pete in the sprints and Burke
Powers in the broad jump and
the low hurdles. Both men ac-

two indoor meets.

pen,

It is known now that co-captain
Hal Dean will he able to play.
For how long he will play depends
on the success of various devices
for protecting his nose which he
and Coach John c. Tioesdale have
developed, The protectors will be
tried in practice this week, and
Dean's fate in the Drake game
hangs on their efficacy.

 

GRINNELL

General Electric Official
Will Speak to Senior Men

M, L. Frederick, a representa—
tive of the General Electric com-
pany, will be here Monday to
talk with senior men interested
in opportunities with that com»
pany, Eva Brodeis Hansen, seas
retai-y of the appointment bureau,
announced today.

Frederick will hold two group
meetings 7 one at 9 a. in. and
the cther at 1:30 p. m. Each
of the meetings will be folloucd
by personal interviews.

In an effort to concentrate his
scoring strength from the start,
Trucsdale will start Freddy Luth-
cr at a forward post, with Bill
Conwill at the other. Luther is
at present leading team scoring
with 159 points for the season.

Co-captain Jimmy LaMasney,
however, is very likely to start
in Dean's place at guard, depend-

The GrinncIIsDrulie basket

director of athletics, said to-
day.

ing on Deans condition. LaMas~
ney played excellent ball in that
position in both the Creighton and
Coe games last week.

In the center post will be
Wilbur Luick, whose play and
scoring power have improved in
the past month. At the other
guard will he Bob Berry, one of
the team‘s mainstays for two
years.

The chief difficulty the Pioneers
will have with Drake will not he
the Bulldogs technical exceIIEnce
at the game. In the accepted
sense, Drake is not a good basket-
ball team. They are, however,
the possessors of indomitable
fighting hearts and a rough-and
tumble sp’ it which have driven
them through to a win in many
a ball game. Technically, the
Pioneers are the better club. But
fight is going to have a big
hand in deciding the winner.

As is usual in most Drake—
Crinnell games, both teams will
be playing under the weight of
a gieat tension. And, as is also
usual, the team that can with—
stand and case that tension for it»
self and make the other team
break under it will win. We won't
bother to predict which one it
will he.

Grinnell Rivalry

when Drake and Grinnell tan~
gle on the I=ioiicer floor Friday
night it will he the fifty-seventh
game in a rivalry which has lastc
ed between the two schools for
31 years.

Competition started between the
schools in 1907. and almost ended
right then, because the Pioneeis
went on to win the first 21
games in a row, before Drake
could edge out a win. The situ—
ation reversed then, however, for
Drake won the next 15 in a row.

During his first year here as
basketball coach, John .C. Trues—
dale's hoys snapped the 15 game
string amid great 10y from stu
dents and townspeople alik
since that time, Drake has won
II of the games and the Pioneer
nine, for an all-time total of 30
games for Grinnell and 26 for the
Bulldogs

An interesting sidelight on the
unpredictability of the two teams
is furnished by the 1934435 sear
son, The Pioneers won the first
game 42-28, and were slapped
down by the Bulldogs 47-24 only
a month later.

Largest score in the series is a
52-5 win by the Pioneers in the
190910 season,
