Pass AHack
Sough’r by
Lookabaugh

Tosser Needed to
Bolster Pioneer
Aerial Weapon

By Clark A. Smith

After a day of rest Monday in
which coach Guy Lookabaugli
sent his Pioneer gridmen through
an easy signal drill, the squad
settled down to a hard scrim-
mage yesterday.

The squad, as a whole, survived
the gruelling Teachers battle in
good condition but needs more
work to put its machinery into
better running condition.

Lookabaugh was not at all dis»
appointed with the showing of the
team Saturday when it lost at
Cedar Falls.

Tough Game.

“It was a tough game to lose,"
he said, “but it was lost to a good
outfit. l feel that if our passing
attack had been clicking, as it
was against Cornell, it might
have been a different story."

Harold High, guard, received
the only severe injury of the
game. Several bruised ribs are
likely to keep the stocky line—
man out of contact work for a
week or so. It is a certainty,
however. that he will be in shape
for the Central game Oct. 14.

One of the most encouraging
features of the Panther game was
the fine showing made by three
sophomores, Ed Walters, Bob
Hamann and John Kennefick.
Squad Strengthened

The first two mentioned are
backs while Kennefick is a tackle,
Because of the showing these men
made. Lookabaugh feels that the
sound has been strengthened con-
siderdbly with their development.

Tuesday night, a black jersied
team. with Jorgensen and Blank
at ends, Berg and Kennefick at
tackles, Reed and Young at
guards, Vaughn at Center, Moehl
and Niffenegger at halves, Rob-
inson at quarter and Walters at
tailback, Scrimmag’ed against the
W’hltes.

White Team.

On the white team were crosse
man and True. ends; Reynolds and
VVncle, tackles; Tscll my and Parr
inger, guards: Gardner, center
White and Little, halves; Fort,
quarterback; and Nash, tailback

Men that Saw most action
against ‘the Tutors rested, but
had promise of resuming their
Contact wol Friday night when
the Varsity will tangle with the
freshmen.

With an open date Saturday
and a warm»up against Ccntral
Friday night. Oct. 14, Lookabdllgh
expects to have his charges in top
shape for the other five contests
on the schedule.
