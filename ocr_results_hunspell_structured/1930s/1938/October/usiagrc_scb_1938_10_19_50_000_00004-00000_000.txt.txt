Billikens Are

Experienced

Sixteen Leltermen
011 St. Louis Squad
Led by Cochran

Back in 1922, when the Pioneers
played their first football game
with St. Louis university, Grinnell
won its first and only game in
the series to date with the Billi—
kens by a score of 25-0. The two
schools have played four times
since then, and each time the
southern university managed to
come out on top,

In their sixth meeting, next
Friday night at St. Louis, the
Pioneers ‘will be up against a fee
that will pack both weight and
experience. Captain Denny Coch-
ran, Versatile Billike'n halfback.
will lead an opposlng array of 16
lettermen who will be available
for action against the Pioneers.

st. Louis' squad of 40 players
averages 184 pounds in weight, so
the Billikens have an advantage
over Grinnell in heft, quantity and
number of veterans.

Coach Cecil E. Muellerleilc will
put a team on the field that will
be strong at the ends but weak
at the guard and tackle positions.
The backfield will be very strong
with the all-conference Denny
Cochran leading the way with his
brilliant kicking, running and
passing,

Weaknesses apparent to date
are in the Billikens' pass defense
and their line play which makes
the St. Louis team considerably
weaker than their last year's
team, which spoiled the Pioneers’
homecoming, 27—7,
