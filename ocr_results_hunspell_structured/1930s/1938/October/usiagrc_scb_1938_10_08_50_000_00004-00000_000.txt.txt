Weight, Experience

Prove Undoing of

Yearling’s Debut
By Clark A. Smith

too much weight and experience

Friday afternoon in their scrim--

mage against the freshmen, and
found little difficulty in rolling
up 20 points to the preps' goose-
egg.

his ent' ~e squad an opportunity to
show its wares.
renolties Halt Drive.

The preps started the contest
by kicking off to the varsity and
the Pioneers last no time in mak
ing a first down. Two penalties
halted their drive, and Homann
was forced to punt, The fresh-
men lost seven yards on their
first. two plays as linemen shot
into the backfield to spill the hall
carriers,

When the regulars received the
punt on their doeyard line, they
lost no time in marching 55
yards for their first marker.
George Little, reserve beck, put
the ball on the twoeyard line with
a 15-yard jaunt and Fred Hu—
manh had little trouble in scoring
from there on a plunge over cen-
ter. The try for the extra point
was spoiled by a fumble.

Races to Varsity 30.

Ray Mathews, for the first year
inen, received the next kickoff
and raced 55 yards to the varsity
30-yard line. This constituted the
only threat the preps made all
afternoon, but they were unable
to carry on from there as the
regulars stopped all their plays
with superior line play.

After a short punt, the varsity
took the ball on its own 20eyarcl
line and marched up the field for
another touchdown. In this series
of plays. Robert Hamann cariied
the brunt of the attack with his
passing and running. His pass to
James Nash over the goal line
climaxed the drive. Nash scored
another point when he skirted
right end for the thirteenth coun-
ter.

The final touchdown was scored
when Tom carmody, prep full
back attempted to punt from deep
in his own territory, and the yar-
sity line surged through to block
the punt on the nineeyard line,

down pass to Ed Walters, who
scored the extra point to end the
scoring for the afternoon,

Homann, Little, Howard Grimes,
Hamann and Walters stood out
for the varsity while Louis Gone
