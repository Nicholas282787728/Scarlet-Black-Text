Nine Candidates
Scramble for Bertha .
In Starting Lineup

By Clark A. Smith
Coach Guy Lookahitgh isn't the
least bit optimistic as he prepares
his charges for the game against
the powerful Drake Bulldogs in
Des Moines Saturday night,

This revival will be the 45th of
a series of games that to date

finds Drake victor in 29 games to,

Grinnell's 13 conquests. Only two
games have ended in a tie, and
the Pioneers haven’t defeated
their most cherished rival since
1932 when they won 770.
Grihncll at Full Strength

The only encouraging note the
'Ploneel‘ mentml sounds is the fact
that Grinnell will be at full
strength for the contest as Fred
Luther and Harold High have

fully recovered from their injuriesl

and are ready to go for

minutes if necessary.

Nine oh Equal Basis.

In the backtirld there is still a
mad scramble for starting poslr
tions with nine men all rated on
just about an equal basis, As to
who will start, Lookabaugh re-
tuses to commit himselt, saying
that “it‘s just a toss-up.”

RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

By Clark Smith

Less than two weeks ago, we
thought there had been a 00111‘
plete revival of student spirit on
the Grinnell ,campus. However,
last Thursday night we went down
to the depot to see the football
team off for St. Louis and found

'only a mere handful of WellrWlshr_

ers present, It was discouraging
to his team to have so little ins
terest shown in its departure.

A little elmourug'elllmlt, praise and
enthusiasm would have helped
the team a great deal. it is too
bad that a send off was not
planned and that Lhe students
were not informed of the squads
departure. or course. it's too late
now to do anything about it, be-
cause the st. Louis trip was the
last one of its kind tor‘ the team
But what we would like to see is
the installation of some PER-
MANENT pep and enthusiasm on
this campus that will not be a
mere passing fancy at each home
game

For the Der0 gainc, the moneers
will be facing a squad somewhat
similar to the Billikeiis. in that
they will be meeting a continual

disadvantage that is impossible to
overcome, but the game Saturday
