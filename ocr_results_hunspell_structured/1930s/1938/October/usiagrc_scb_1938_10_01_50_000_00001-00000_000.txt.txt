yesterday as evils of "too much
going steady, too much dancing
and too much necking."

According to Paul Baichly, cam-
pus social chairman, student opin-
ion is at present divided as to
whether there is a problem here
and as to whether there is actually
any need of a so-called “cam-

Secreiarial

Personnel Office
To Select Best in
shorthand, Typing

Tests for letter placement, typing,
and shorthand will be given to
tentative office employees in the
near future, according to v. D.
Patterson, director of personnel.

Students who pass these tests
with the best results will be given
student employment in various
offices of the school. ‘

The tests will be open to men
as well as women.

There seems to be a tendency
among men to think of secretarial
work as feminine employment.
but, according to Patterson, this
should not be so.

a movement is at present un-
der way toward male office help,
Patterson said, explaining that
some large concerns are employ-
ing only men: He also pointed out
that chances are good for ad-
vancement.

Thc tests will be made out by
Seldon H, Norris, instructor in
business administration.

ment.

Central Agency Designed to
Serve Students and Merchants

Local Businesses
Protected Against
Unfair Competition

Long a curiosity on the campus,
it is due time facts about the
control agency are put into print,

A buying and distributing agen-
cy, whose purpose it is to render
service to both the students of
the college and the merchants in
town, it is one of the most active
business organizations on the
campus.

In both the quadrangle and the
dormitory, there are two student
“runners" who go through the
halls picking up clothes for laun-
dry, cleaning and pressing. Shoes
that need repairing are also col-
lected.

 

Every evening, immediately aft-

ler dinner, parcel post packages
are distributed at the offices of
the central agency:

These offices are located on the
south wall of the Little Theatre
in the quadrangle, and in the
north end of Clark hnll basement
in the men’s dormitory.

When a student does not have
cash on hand. small charge ac-
coluits may be kept with the
agency, However, the agency is a
business organization and must
meet its obligations.

There have been, in the past,
instances of solicitors operating
throughout the halls without the
expressed sanction of authoritics.

This action was immediately
regarded as unfair to merchants
complying with agreements be-
tween the Grinnell Chamber of
‘Commerce and his college. ‘
