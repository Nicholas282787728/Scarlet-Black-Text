Hell Week Hop
Tonight Makes
Girl Get Boy

Probably the most pleasing part
of Hell Week for the freshmen
will be the women's varsity to-
night. which is to be held in their
honor. The dance, which has ap-
propriately been renamed the “Hell
Week Hop," will be held in Rand
gymnasium.

In addition to selecting their
partners, as is customary at all
women's varsities, the women will
also be required to call for their
dates at the dorms and escort
them to the dance. The reason
for doing this, according to Paul
Baiclily, social chairman of the
campus, is not that the preps are
especially bashful but that they
Wlll have had sufficient exercise
to merit this extra convenience
from the girls.

Music will be furnished by
Woody sargo and his band, in a
return engagement,

Chaperones will be Mrs. H. F.
Thompson, hostess in Dibble hall;
Mrs. W. T. Moyle, hostess in Gates
hall; Mrs. Hazel Bishop, hostess
in the White House; Grant 0.
Gale, associate professor of phys—
ics, and Mrs. Gale; L. Wendell
Hayes, instructor in economics,
and Mrs. Hayes; and Shelton L.
Beatty, dean of men, and guest.

MacDonald Recital Pleases
Appreciative Grinnell Audience

By Carl Niemeyer

Grim-tell audiences have learned
that, oddly enough, when pianists
come to us from the outside we
are likely to near conventional
programs with plenty of Chopin
and Liszt; if we wish to hear the
great amount of unhackneyed
music for the piano, we must not
expect it from the great star on
a. concert tour but rather from
persons on our own faculty, who
are aware that we listen with
pleasure to other things than inil
tary polonaises and Hungarian
rhapsodies.

The program chosen by Miss
Sarah Illness MacDonald for her
recital last night at Herrick chapel
Included much that is pleasant to
near but yet has not been heard
too frequently. Even the classical
numbers, which opened the pro—
gram, were pleasantly unfamiliar;
especially agreeable was Haydn's
“Fantasia in C," which like all
true classics says a great deal in
a way that seems definitive and
inevitable.

The largest piece was Cesar
Franck’s “Prelude. Chorale, and
Fugue,” played by Miss MacDon-
ald with the reverence due to one
of the greatest works in all the
literature for the piano. yet played

 

without the sirupy richness which
some performers read into
Franck's scores,

In spite of the fineness of her
interpretation of the Franck, whose
sober serenity must be to music
what the finest of Wordsworth is
to literature, Miss MacDonald was
happiest in her playing of the sev-
en modeln pieces with which the
recital closed. Everyone has heard
that modern music is dissonant.
but ‘not everyone knows that it
can also be beautiful, and not ev-
eryone recognises that it is often
witty. The beauty was perfectly
apparent in Miss MacDonald's
playing of the Tcheropine “Ncca
turnc": the wit in her playing of
Bartok's “Scherzo," Poulenc’s
“Trois Mouvcmcnts Perpetuels,"
and Ravel’s ‘Flecc en formc de
Habdnera.”

By now, of course, Debussy has
become almost a classic; but
“L'lsle Joyeuse” and “Reflets daus
l'Eau," which Miss MacDonald
gave for an encore, though pos-
sibly the most familiar numbers
of the evening, were wcll suited
to a program which revealed how
much pianists owe the French
composers, as well as how much
audiences owe to performers who
risk the unfamiliar.

Grinnell Scores on
65 Yard Pass from
Hamann to Powers

By Clark A. Smith ,

(St. Louis, Mo, Oct. 21);History
repeated itself tonight when a
powemil squad of St. Louis Billi-
kens battered a courageous Pit»
neer team into submission, 27—7,
the identical score of last year's
contest between the two elevens.

Just, as last year, the Billikens
rolled up two touchdowns to go
into a. 134) lead before the Grim
nEll team seLlled down to playing
ball in the first half.

First St. Louis Scores

The first St, Louis marker was
made possible by poor punting on
the part of the Pioneers who
permitted the Bllllkens to Start
a drive from the Scarlet and
Black's 33 yard line. Denny Coch<
ran, allrconfel'ence player for the
southern team, rambled 23 yards
to the Seven yard line; and from
there, McGonnlgle drove over left
tackle into pay dirt.

Grinnell Fumbles.

On the kickoff following the
touchdown, Gl'innell fumbled, and
the Billikens recovered at mid»
field. After an exchange of punts,
St. Louis tried a long pass from
the Pioneer 29 yards line, MeGon-
nigle to Cochran; and it was com-
pleted for their second touch
down. A succesrul conversion gave
them their 13 points,

With the first quarter not yet
over and Crinnell playing the ball
for the fourth time after the sec-
ond kickoff, another touchdown
was made. but this time by the
Pioneers. Bob Hemann, who had
just entered the game, tossed a
pass to Burke Powers from his
own 36 yard line. Powers caught
the ball on the Bllliken 40 yard
line and raced down the sidelines
for a touchdown. The play netted
64 yarns, and a moment later
Shelton placekicked the extra point
to give the Pioneers their only 7
points of the game.

The second and third quarters
were scoreless as both teams
