Moehl slated to start at blocking
back in place of George Little.

If Grimes is unable to see full
service at center, Ed Vaughn, a
light but scrappy reserve of two
years experience. will get the
call. Lookahaugh is still undecided
as to who will start at the left
guard position, saying it will be
either Harold High or Norman
'rscliirley.

We're Happy To See

Grinnellians Don’t take a back seat in style.

They’re paging you up front.

We feel like this . . . that the man with $15.50
to spend for his dead! is as much of a. stylist as
the man with $50.

And the chap who can only afford $22.50 for his
Thanksgiving suit is going to wear that suit into
the same places the $40 suit buyer goes.
Regardless of cost . . . our customers get style in
the cut and quality in the fabric . . and if we
seem to favor thel man with a limited income,
please remember thnt for every man who can af—
ford to “throw it away" there are thousands who
have to use the soft pedal,
