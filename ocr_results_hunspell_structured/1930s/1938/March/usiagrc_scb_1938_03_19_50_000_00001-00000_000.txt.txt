Seniors Will

,, Have Third
Job Survey

Personal Interviews
Of Different Type I
Will Be Tried

One innovation will be insti-
tuted when Grinnell seniors in—
vade Chicago March 29 for the
third annual Gi-inneil job survey.
On Thursday, March 31, the aft-
ernoon will be set aside free of
interviews and conferences so
that seniors may make one ap-
plication for a job on their own.
without previous contacts.

The project this year will not
be a “job hunt” as it has been
called by some in former years.
Instead, the project will he
carried on in the form of a job
survey, in which the students
will not make direct applications
for jobs in their interviews, but
will seek through contacts with
employers to discover the voca-
tion which best suits their apti-
tudes and training. In addition,
they will make inquiries concern-
ing employee training, employer-
employee relationships, and simi-
lar matters. ,

“Students will get experience
through direct contact with ems
pioyers, not through hearsay," v.
D. Patterson, director of the
project, said.
