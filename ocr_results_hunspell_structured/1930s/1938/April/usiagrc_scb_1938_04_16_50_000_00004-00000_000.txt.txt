High Gear

Lookabgugh Seeks
New Backfield

Combination

By Edward Wilson

As spring football drills swing
into high gear, Coach Guy Looka-
baugn is searching tor a back
field. Fred Homann. fullback, and
Verne Robinson, quarterback, are
the only returning men who
played in last year's backﬁeld
combinations. Jimmie Nash is the
only other back with any experi-
ence at all and Nash didn't play
regularly last year.

To cope with the situation,
Lookabaugh is grooming George
Tompkins and Robert Moehl,
juniors for backfield posts Tomp-
kins, who has had no previous
football experience promises toi
develop, but must learn iast to
do any good {or next year Moehl.
who has had some high school
experience. also has to develop
fast, as he ,too, will be playing
his final season.

The kicking and passing duties
will probably {all to Fred Homann
who did quite a bit of both last
year. Bob Jones. center will
probably get his share of the
kicking assignments No fresh-
men have been given a chance
to show as yet, but no Walters
and Bob Harnann showed well as
punters last fall playing with the
prep squad.

Intensive blocking and tackling
drills were stressed in practice
this week According to Locka-
baugh, they will continue to be
stressed throughout the rest of
this spring. At he end oi the
second scheduled week of prac-
tice, the team is responding well
to the drills and conditioning.

Misunderstanding,
Trouble—History
Repeating Itself

By Clark Smith
The trouble and misunderstand-
ing over the tennis court problem
is just history repeating itself.
The women demand that the men
keep off their courts and the men
demand that their courts be put
into shape so they won't have to
play on the \Nomen‘s courts.

Recendy, the Student Council
and League Board investigated
the matter and inquired of John
c, Truesdale, athletic director,
just why there was all this diffi-
culty. Truesdale immediately ex-
plained that the athletic depart-
ment was doing everything in its
power to remedy the situation.

“The main difficulty is lack of
student support,” the director ex-
plained. “Our department has a
list oi students who are behind
in their work credit and have the
time to work on the courts. We
contacted these men and failed to
receive any cooperation on the
matter."

As a result, Truesdale explain»
ed. it has been necessary to get
outside, non-student help. “Until
the students show a little interest
in a good money making proper
sition, the condition of the tennis
courts will continue to be a prob-
lem," he' concluded. “We must
have their cooperation."
