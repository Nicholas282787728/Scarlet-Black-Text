(sarrhl in The Starlet and Black)

l OMAHA, Nam—Several record
‘breaking performances appear cer-
tain to take place when track and
field stars of the Missouri Valley
conference assemble at Creighton
university here for their annual
track and field championships on May
,20 to 21.

On the Drake university squad,
present champions of the circuit, are
Fred “Tiny" Blanck and Captain
Ralph Collins. Blanck, who placed
fourth in the shot put in the Drake
relays with a toss of 47 feet 5 inches.
has only to repeat his performance
,to beat the record of 47 feet 2 22/25
'inches set by Richersou of Missouri
in 1927, and Collins will have to add
but a few inches to his marks of the
early spring to break Frank Virslg’s
pole vault record of 15 feet 4 27/64
inches,

Records Face Pilbrow

Myron Pilbrow, a veteran distance
ace, gives Grinnell college a record
breaking possibility. Pilbrow, like
Blanck, must only repeat early sea-
son performances to outdo the two-
mile mark of 9:383 set by Frazier
'of Kansas in 1927,

Another star who should write his
name on the record books is Bert
lNelsou of Butler university, who
'copped the high jump in the Drake
relays with a lcap of 6 feet 3 1/:
inches. The present mark is six feet
3 i/3 inches, set by Poor of Kansas
in 1925.

 

Glass Threatens

A report from Oklahoma A. and
M college states that Peyton Glass,
11, is expected to inaugurate his cams
paign for a place on the United States
Olympic team with a double victory
in the 100 and ZEDcyard dashes in the
Valley meet, .

Creighton university is without a
serious threat to any of the present
records, as is Washington university
in St. Louis, although both schools
have several potential point winners
in camp.

Moon Man
Seeks Mate
in May Fete

Annual Outdoor Festival,

Presented by Women,

Pleases Crowd

By MARGUEKITE KONECNY

The story of the search of the Man
in the Moon for thc loveliest of maid-
ens to be his wife was the theme of
the annual May festival presented by
the women‘s physical education de-
partment last night in the lovely set-
ting of the center campus which was
transformed into an outdoor theatcr.
More than one hundred .women par-
ticipated in the event which was di-
rected by Miss Clara Julia Andersen,
assisted by the members of the pag-
eantry class and an orchestra directed
by Chester Williams.

Faith Somers as the Silveryrgarbed
Man in the Moon was slowly let down
from the lighted moon anchored in a
tree top and started on the search
for the moon goddess among the mor-
tals. Thc traveler first visited old
Japan in time to see a colorful dance
of thc lanterns, :t {on dance by vi
vacious little Japanese maidens, and
a charming cherry blossom dance all
given in honor of the betrothal of the
princess, Sidney Himes, to the prince
Marjorie Will,

Dutch Gllrdell Jolly

Finding nothing here to please his
fancy, however, be next peered into
a Dutch scene which included a group
of 'clever character numbers. Two
jolly gardeners, Eleanor Pfaff and
Marjorie Schuchert, had ceased their
labors to rlance with a flaxen-haii-ed
maid, Polly Parker, to the times of
a fiddler, Daphne lvinc. Here, too,
he saw Gretel, Truly Trousdalc, tired

Potential Barrymores Wax Romantic
asi,‘Merchant of Venice’ Progresses

By LILLIE HAGEN

Blue Shadow: flicker gently o'er
the stage. The dim light rcvcals three
male figures 'n the background, who
maintain a discreet silence. Poised
impressively on the foreground steps,
guitar in arm, a tall, slender youth
gazes balconyeward, wlicre the faint
outlines of a girl (or is it a boy?)
can be discerned, Softly, tenderly, he
begins to sing in dulcct tones: “Jess-
ica, sweet my love!” As the last ten-
or notc dies away, the girl breathes
excitedly, “Who are you? I’ll swear
that I do know your tongue!"

As, of course you’ve guessed it
ROWrChrlS Rhynsberger is rehears-
ing‘ his Big Moment with Roberto
Vance, in the cause of “The Merchant
of Venice,” which will be given by
the department of drama May 19,
20, 21 and at commencement, For
weeks Lorenzo and Jessica have been
practicing their love scenes together,
and now they have attaincd a. high
degree of perfection,

Casket Tumblcs

But listen in again. “Here, catch
this casket!" cries Jessica, but either
her aim is poor or Lorenzo is still ro—
mancing, for the “casket“ hits the
floor with a thud, mingled with the
metallic clink of nails, screws, and
other hardware contents. The spell
is broken; the background figures
(Salarino, Salanio, and Gratiano)
come to life, Lorenzo hobbies down
the steps (he’s had a bad foot lately),
and fair Jessica makes her own way
down from the balcony.

"Act Two, first scene,” calls Mis.
Sara Sliormari Pryor, who is direct-
ing the play. And like the proverbial
Jack Robinson, the scene shifts. 0ut
rushes a short, prancing figure, who
gesticulatcs wildly. laughs and crys
all at once, and gambols madly about
on the stage. cher has the Alumni
Recitation hall auditorium been so
shaken. Is it an acrobat, a madman,

 

or both? Now we have itito be sure.
it’s Launcelot Gobbo, the clown. Who
ever dreamed that Maurice Rirdsall
could disport himself so vigorously,
and in such a jaunty mariner,

Mcyrr Plays Golilio

Here comes a weak, faltering old
man on the stage. He is making right
for Launcclot Gobbo, but the clown
is, for some playful reason, avoiding
the poor blind soul. “Which way to
master Jew's, young gentleman?"
quavers old Cobbo in a trcmulous
falsetto. (Mason Mcyer, himself, as
we live!) Launcelot teases him, but
the old man grabs hold of a lock
of young Gohbo's hair, and they in-
dulge in an oldfashioned hair—pulling
contest.

This» is interrupted by the entrance
of Bassanio (Howard Warrington).
Aristocratic and selfeconlztined, he
presents a marked contrast to the
clown and old Gobbo.

Sliylock Mustcrlul

Again the scone changes, and now
we see Shylock himself. The old Jew
is vindictively hissing epithets
against the "pork-eaters," and he is
almost too convincing. He creates in
us feelings of resentment and admire-
tio , his characterization is magnifier
cm, It is only when he descends the
platform and assumes his natural
posture that we realize the man as
George Seivcr, professor of French.

Antonio now has the stagc, and we
listen admiringly to his low musical
tones, His tall, commanding figure
contrasts greatly with the small.
boisterous Gratiano and the gay
“playbnys” of Venice, Salarino and
Salanio.

“That's all for tonight, people!”
announces Mrs. Pryor, and Guilford
Collison, Robcrt M. Brown, Irwin axe
ley and Donald Ross descend, sighing
audibly, from the platform. Another
night of rehearsal has ended, with
“The Merchant of Venice” that much
nearer perfection.
