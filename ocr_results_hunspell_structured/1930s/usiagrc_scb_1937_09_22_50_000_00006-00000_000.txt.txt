TO GRIN NELL

There are few transitions ill the life of
the modern young American as hard as that
from high school to college. For many it
means being on their “own" for the first
time in life. In many cases ilew faces, new
discoveries, new experiences and new con-
tacts make totally different personalities,
but it is the hope and aim of Grinncll tllat
whatever change is brought about may be
for the making of a richer life after gradua-
tion; a life in which yoll freshmen may have
many occasions to be able to say twenty
yelalrs from now, ”I am glad I went to Grill-
ne .”

Very few words of admonition can be
applied with equal meaning alld effect upon
the freshmen as a whole, but among those
few there is one phrase that is in keeping
with the Grinnell atmosphere and although
it may be more useful to the freshman, no
student can fail to profit by it. Change your
ideas often, your ideals less frequently.

Grinnell, as you have been often told, is
a democratic school. As a college its pur-
ose is to inspire thinking and the formation
‘of self»made ideas; as Grinnell its purpose is
to give free rein to the expression of those
ideas in a spirit of tolerance with mutual re-
spect for the ideas of ones fellow students
Do not be afraid to change your ideas. The
narrow-minded student is a misfit at Grill-
nell and is losing nluch of the value of his
college education while ill residence hcre.
Ideas need not be changed on the spur of the
moment by mere suggestion, for one might
almost say that half an education is the
knowledge gained by investigation in the
support of one’s ideas and the free exchange
of opinion.

But with ideals we come to an altogeth»
er different term. Although seemingly so ' t
times, idealism is not a lost art; indeed it is
doubtful if it will ever be. A man is a man
and a Grimlcllian because of his adherence
to his convictions, Every Grillllelliall wheth-
er a member of the class of 1941 or any
other member of the student body has cer-
tain ideals. They are not subjects to be bar-
tered and sold in the camaraderie of the
bull-Session or the quadrangle Spread. Do
not give them up llntil it is conscientiously
impossible for you to entertain them any
longer. Grinnell has its ideals nlld Grill-
nell’s students must have their ideals to get
the utmost benefit and pleasure out of col—
lege now and after graduation.

STRIKE. UP THE BAND

In this issue of the Scarlet and Black
Mr, Chester Williams, band director, asks
that students interested iii joining that or—
ganization see him for tryouts. We wish to
add our bit to this invitation b suggesting
a few reasons why you Should j in the band.

In the first place may we suggest to
new students who are musically inclined
that this is an opportunity to keep in prac-
tice on your instrument, and at the same

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

time get acquainted with others with similar
interests. l

Then too, tllose ill the band will be in a
favorable position when the various occa-
sions at which the band plays roll around.
Every student should have an activity and
band will fill the bill for many of your

Old students will find that lnally of the
above reasons apply to them, but perhaps
more important they realize that ill support-
illg the band they are supporting all organi-
zation which can do much for school spirit.

There’s nothing quite like a good band to
pop things up, so get behind our band, joille
iug if possible, but at least giving moral
Support.

LET ’EM EAT CAKE

In France, with wheat selling on the
opcll market for $2.85 a bushel, it is possible
to buy a two pound loaf of bread for eight
cellts.

In this country, with wheat selling for less
than $1.20 a bushel, it is almost impossible
to find a full pound loaf of bread selling for
less than ten cents.

Obviously there is something wrong
when a situation such as this can exist. We
are inclined to believe that the fault is ours.

We ill the United States have for many
years boasted to the world at large that we
had the lnost efficient methods existent in
our factories and businesses. We have been
very proud of the high standard of living
these methods have allegedly made possible.

Now it seems that all our modern meth
ods of manufacture have not enabled us to
make that first necessity for any kind of live
ing, bread, as efficiently as France.

Perhaps in our frequent criticisms of
capitalism on the grounds of unequal distri-
bution of wealth we have overlooked the
possibility that it may be our American ap-
plication of capitalism and not capitalism
itself which is to blame.

And perhaps we should stop boasting
about our superiority and start proving it.

DELIGHTFUL DISEASE

(Reprinted from The Daily O’Collegiitn)

College in many ways is a delightful
disease. Once one is stricken, he never re-
covers. lie is never satisfied with no better
than what his associates have He lnust wear
the best clothes, frequent the smartest enter-
tainment places, own the best car, and so on.
His language and behavior must reflect his
collegiate training. He invariably enjoys
displaying his intelligence, showing that he
reads the best selling novels, and that he
keeps tip with the stage and screen.

The person who has truly been bitten by
the collegiate bllg keeps up with his frater-
nity and alumni association. He returns for
football games. He hopes to keep ahead of
his creditors, but if he does not, his pride
remains intact. If he is successful in busie
ness, he talks of the future; if he is not, he
speaks of the past.

It’s great full, this going to college, and
like death, one is never the some after the

“Coordination, speed, teamwork, physical stam—
inn and the ability to desire to work hnl'dithat's
the stuff that makes winning football teams in
any league. The popular myth that some schools
are simply graced with a great deal or fight and
Spirit and can go out there every Saturday with
a lot of fight talk and bowl over their opponents
is purely bunk." Words with impact from “Hunk”

“I do not regard college as an intellectual filling
station Where you can go to take on a certain num-
ber of gallons of education," De Pauw univer 'ty’s
president, Clyde E, Wildman, explains that a trained
mind, respect for others, social imagination and abil-
ity to discriminate between the values of life com»
prise a college education.

“It is surprising that the vast majority of stur
dents harely squeeze by on their science require
ments, fearful that taking more science would man
too great an exertion on their part. Many students
similarly avoid English composition courses, having
completed their freshmen requirements.” Registrar
Robert 0. Conant of Dartmouth college advises the
“science sidesteppers” and “Englishrevadcrs” to ex-
pand educationally,
