Grinnell to Play
Bears Saturday

 

 

Washington May Lose Loop
Leadership if Drops

Battle Here.

Battling for the Bluejsys. It's
scarcely what might be expected af-
ter that little affair of last week,
but that's just what Grinnell will be
doing Saturday night when the Pier!
necr basketmon tackle Washington‘
on the local floor. If Grinnell can»
take the Bears into camp, with the
defeat which Drake has already giv-
en them, it means the top of the
Missouri Valley heap for Creighton
without much doubt. But it may al~
so mean a second place berth for
Grinnell.

Washington has already trimmed
the Pioneers once, but that does not
mean that it will be possible again.
The Crinnellians have 'shown worlds
of improvement since that evening in
St. Louis when the Bears romped
over them rough-shod, as was shown i
by the Creighton battle, The dope
bucket tilts the other way when one
finds that Grinnell defeated Drake
and that the Bulldogs in turn down»
ed the touted St. Louis lads.

Meyer Good Shot

Washington's biggest bet on any
market is Ed (Moose) Meyer, cap.
taiu and center. who stands at six
feet one inch and has a dead eye for
the rim. Recently the lanky Meyer,l
who led the Valley scoring last sea-l
son. has been shifted to forward,
Coach Don White shifting in a cerrr
tain Springer to handle center.

Meet to Col—nhuskers
by 55-20 Score.

After a disastrous start, the Grin-
nell college swimming team will go
to Omaha Saturday night where it
will tackle the Creighton mermen in
the second dual meet of the season.
Although the Pioneers dropped the
contest with the University of Ne-
braska swimmers here last Saturday
by a count of 55 to 20. without tak-
ing a first they are doped to show
the Biuejuys some speed. Most of
the events here went in faster time
than the Creighton men have shown
this season,

Debong and Dewey are
first places, DeLong in the breast

should secure a place in one of the
dash events. Miller is likely to cop
the 440 yard swim and Thomas may
take points in the back stroke.
Coach Carroll Swearengen has not
yet announced the complete list of
men who will make the trip.

, Team Does Well

The Pioneer natators, although they
failed to take a first place, did not
make a bad showing against the
Cornhuskers, pushing them hard in
races which went in fast time. The
visitors always had a little more
steam at the last than did the Pine
neers, however. The only record
broken was the Big Six mark in

Grinnell Songs
Are Sung Over
WH 0 Sunday

The Singing Sophomores, a quar-
tet composed of Drake university
students, dedicated a program to
Grinnell college last Sunday evening
over radio station WHo. The
quartet, which is composed of Clark
Geiehouse, first tenor; Cuthbert
Hurd, first bass; Joc Houston, sec~
ond bass, and Hoyt Irwin second
tenor, opened their program with the
Gn'nnell song, “Here Come the Pio—
neers." The announcer gave a brief
review of the history of the college
and the origin of the name “Pio-
nears" which is applied to the athe
letic teams.

After two popular selections the
announcer told about James Nor-
man Hall, author of “Sons of Old
Grinnell" which was the next song
by the quartet. After another popur
lar number the men sang the "Grin—
nell Alumni Song” followed shortly
by “On Grinnell."

This is the third of a series of pro-
grams presented by the Drake Sings
ers, the first two having been dedi-
cated to Drake and Iowa State. oth-
er college broadcasts will probably
be held in th future.

Christianity Must Break, Old
Molds and Modernize Self,

States Brooks in Lectures

‘Great Task of Religion Gets
Start Where Field of

Science Ends.’

“Religion has no place for Pol-
lyaunas. The love which is a part
of true religion is not general ami—
ahility but strong good will." Ex-
pressing this ss one of the import-
ant points in the makeup of religion,
Dr. Raymond C. Brooks yesterday
morning opened the 1930 Gates lec-
tures in long chapel on the subject
“The Place of Religion in the Build-
ing of Civilization."

Dr. Brooks named four other
points which constitute the essence
of religipn. Righteousness, reverr
ence to both God and man, holiness,
which he also expressed as wholiness
to designate the completeness of re-
ligion, and faith of spirit, go with
love in making up religion.

As introduction to his general
topic, "The Old Religion in the New
World", Dr. Brooks spoke of some of
the problems which face the church,
principally that of the comparatively
recent introduction of science.
“There is no doubt." he said, "that
science has come to the modern
world to stay. It has introduced a
new method of study into religion; it
has changed the concepts of God and
Jesus. of heaven and hell.

Religion Brings Wisdom

“Knowledge is to wisdom what
food is to muscle. and while know-
ledge comes through science, wisdom
comes only through spiritual experi-
ence.
gins where science ends; to discipline
desire, to test the truths of science.

“The problem of religion is how
human life may acquire the highest
value.
the inquiry of fact but to it belongs
the inquiry of value."

The reestablishment of e concep-
tion of personality is another prob»

lem which the church has to face.‘

“Religion is the champion of person
al values. The meaning of life is to
he found in these personalities," he
said.

Further. Dr. Brooks told what re-
ligion is. “Religion is the outcome
of human experience, Man is the
inhabitant of two worlds, that of na-
ture and that of spirit. His religion
is the result of the interplay of the
human spirit with the mystic spirit
of the universe.”

Religion Helps Life

Speaking of two of the church
schools of thought Dr. Brooks said.
“Fundamentalism and modernism
are both ineffectual in the face of

the problems of religion, fundament-i

alism because of its moral blindness
and modernism because it is in bond-
age to an optimism which disregards
certain facts of nature and history
and because it is too involved with

The real task of religion be-'

It must surrender to science‘

‘Christianity Must Adapt
itself to Cultural

lnfluences.’

“The big problem of the twen-
tieth century is to break both
the catholic and Protestant molds. to
transcend them and create a new
mold that Lhe religion of Jesus may
function afresh," was the thesis of
the second Gates lecture given in
long chapel this morning by Dr. Ray—
mond C. Brooks. The general theme
of Dr. Brmks’ rive lectures is ”Hie
01d Religion in the New World."

Dr. Brooks asserted that Hebrew-
ism. Hellenism, Romanlsm and Mod-
ernism are the four cultural influ-
ences through which Christianity has
passed. Since religion is always a.
part of the cultural stream of which
it is a part, today the question is,
"Can the old religion survive in this
new world?" Romanism and 15m»
testantism, the last two stages
through which Christianity is pass-
ing, must be broken down and a new
mold created in their places.

Four Men Influence

“Christianity has passed through
a transition from being a Jewish re-
ligion to one for humanity, from a
visible teacher to an invisible spirit
and from a narrow interpretation to
one which is universe Dr. Brooks
said

"Christianity has been influenced
Iby four lives, Peter s, Stephens,
Paul's and John's. 1! Christianity
.had depended on Peter alone. it
would never have become a separate
thing. The faith of Stephen, a
Greek, so impressed Paul that its in-
ﬂuence changed ultimately. In Paul,
three streams of time meetiRclman,
Jewish, Greek. He was a man of
cosmopolitan mind and was an in-
,tense Jew. All the values of religion
depend upon the qualities of the
spirit; Paul completely triumphed by
the end of the ﬁrst Century.”

l “By the end of mat century,
Christianity began to flow through
the Greek world and ceased to be
simply a Jewish religion. By the
middle of the second century one of
the church fathers apologized for
the fundamentalists who were JeW<
iah Christians: Jewish Christianity
had thus quickly passed away. It
had given us the Sabbath, an institu-
tion‘called the church, the gospels
ltespecially the New Testament and
lthe synoptics), it had given us a un-
ion of the old and new testaments
linking intimately the religion of
Jesus with that which had gone be-
fore. ,
Paul Makes Additions
i "Paul made five great additions to
the religion: he thought in univer-
sal terms, teaching that' religion is
rooted in human nature; he taught
‘Church unity although he was the
,author of the movement of denomin-
jationalisrn; he taught that Christ
was ‘tlle bone of our bone' and that
the Christ in you is the hope of
glory. he lifted the spirit of God to
higher levels, and he lifted Christ-
like living and and Christian think-
ing so that they can 'never be dis-
solved."
l, "The Greek influence which was
brought to bear upon Christianity in
the first Century,” stated Dr. Brooks,
was spoiled by the influence of the
Roman mind It became a religion
‘of the rich and powerful The vis-
ible, organized church began to as<
sume a place of authority and the
development of the church became
the aim of those in it. This power
is quite apart from the religion of
Jesus. In the emphasis upon the
priesthood. simple morality was neg-
lected for ecclesiastical morality.
Christianity was suffering inward
