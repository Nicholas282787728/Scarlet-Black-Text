STUDENT THINKING—A REALITY

The proposed system to abolish exams and substitute
unannounced quizzes which was submitted to the faculty
committee on educational policies and ' lations is of interest
not only for its content but for its 0 gin and development.

The very fact that it was drawn up and submitted by
students is of paramount interest. For many years there
has been criticism that students were not really interested
in campus problems. Some of the faculty and even a few
students have felt that student representation and govern—
ment was a joke because of the disinterested attitude of the
Students.

Now comes evidence that there is a very real interest
on the part of some students at least. The present year has
already been productive of acts showing that student
governing bodies are vitally interested in dolng things and
now these three students go even further and suggest a
totally new educational policy.

Without further study of the plan we would not go on
record either in favor of or against it We do say that the
spirit in which it was conceived is worthy of encouragement
and that on the face of it, the idea seems to have been
carefully thought out.

Whatever its merits, it is entitled, as a product of stu-
dent initiative, to careful consideration, not only by the
faculty committee which has already expressed interest ill
it, but by each and every student and faculty member who
considers himself intelligent and alive.

 

THE EDITORS.

A GOOD JOB wail—nor?

Recent timely exhibits on the tables flanking the
main door of the library have brought lis the realization
that there is on the library staff an artist taking pride in
good work. Perhaps not many students have been conscious
of the fine displays, and if so, we suggest a look the next
time you are there.

In recent weeks there have been displays of the works
of Grinnellians, a display concerning- Will Durant, one of
books on international relations and other equally worth-
while subjects.

When so many of us find our time for reading- limited
by the press of school assignments these displays, bringing
important things to our minds, vividly as they do, selve
a very definite and useful purpose. For as they bring to
our attention items we otherwise might miss so do they
stimulate our intellectual growth.

To the unknown originator of the displays ollr con-
gratulations and thanks for a job well done

QUOTABLE QUOTES

”Cl‘ainmlﬂg students with facts isn't enough , . The aim of eflu»
cation )5 to produce men and women who will have character‘ as well
as information and be a genuine asset to the society in which they
live." Dr. Wayne Gardner, vice president of Northwest Nazarene col-
lege, believes a higher education should develop a student’s character
as well as his mind.

lETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

K
Dear Sir:

The proposed plan for a new
,system of examinations for Grin-
nell has undoubtedly drawnmany
critics pro and con. Many of the
criticisms have been made known
to us and it seems that the few
objections to such a plan have
come because of a misunderstand-
ing of the general purpose and
what such a plan would actually
mean to the students.

The fundamental purposes of
Jthis plan aim to accomplish the
,fcllowing points: First, this plan
hopes to solve the temptation
for cribbing and also to eliminate
,thc necessity of cramming. The
‘present condition tends to place
emphasis on the knack of pro
senting facts for examinations
which are not representative of
the fundamentals of the course.
It is believed that this situation
produces a distortion of grades
with respect to the general
knowledge that the student actur
ally has of the course. One does
not like to think that grades are
important, but they are the
standard by which onc's scholas-
tic achievements are judged, and
must be considered, The pros
posed plan will place a. premium
on the ability to grasp and re~
tam the essentials of a subject as
they are presented.

Second. the quizzes will keep
L||c student informed as to what
the instructor considers vital in

 

 

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1937

the organization of the colirsc.I
The instructor Will also be able L0
keep a closer check on what the
students are obtaining from the,
course. By doing a moderate‘
amount of daily work, the Shir
dent Will be able to keep at his
control the essentials of the Sub>l

:ect, ‘

The original plan as proposed
was not meant to be taken as a
rigid outline to be followed but
merely as a suggestion of points
of which the plan should consist.
Sincerely,
Roy Jensen.
Harold Squire.
Charles Wirt.
