SPORTS

By PAT GALLAGHER

Now colnes the difficult task of ex.
plaining that terrific 51.33 wallcping
that the Pioneers suffered at the hands
of Tulsa last night. Why, oh why did
it happen? Of ccursc.accoi-ding to
rumor at least—the Gl'innell squad was

_ considerably weakened by sickness and
injury; and perhaps the team was just
a bit over—confident (remember, Wash.
ington had trimmed Tulsa 21-13). But
most likely it was just that old three.
game trip hoodoo.

o r r c
Those long cagc lrips arc lhc
bane of a team’s cxistcnce. Even
the most powcriul ol quinlcis has
just so much cnergy to put into
the game. Though the Washhnrn
game \on Sﬂflll'tlil)” shouldn’t have

taxed the men much, the 24.29

battle with the Oklahoma Aggics

on Monday night lorccd them to
extend tllclusclvcs tn the limit.
. c .

This is not the first tune that Grin.
ncll has droppcd an unexpected gains
during the annual prolonged southern
trip. One need look no further than
the 193334 season for further evidence
of the trials and tribulations of three.
game trips. Witness the Grinnell trek
oi last year. The Pioneers were big
favorites to sweep the three game
series with Washington and the Aggies
(two with the latter); but after trim.
lning Washington they icll victim to
a Cowboy uprising and lost 29.23.

Iowa stock in the Missouri Valley
Conference hit a decided slump last
night as the Tulsa Golden Hurricane
roared lhrough a ragged—playing Grin.
nell quintet 51 to 33 and the Washington
Bears came out of hibernation to nip
Drake 33.32. As a result of these
two upsets the Valley race has been
turned into a mad scramble, and all
the teams except the Oklahoma Aggica
and Washburn arc in a position lo at
least tie for the loop title.

The Tulsans, who had
the conference cellar from
beginning oi the scason, now find
themselves in fifth place. On the
other hand, the Drake Bulldogs have
skidded from a position at the head
of the Valley standings down to fourth
place. Grinnell remains at the top of
the heap but is now forced to share
the position with Creighton.

Jays to Play Twicc

Creighton will lace two Valley
opponents this weekend, while all the
other league teams have one loop
game scheduled, The Jays will reopen
their conference campaign on Friday
against Washingwn at St. Louis. All
the other games will he played Satur—

at Topeka, Kans., and the latter at
Des Moines.

All Games Important

A loss for either Grinnell or Creigh.
ton, while the other chalks up a win.
will give the Victor 3 big advantage in
the title fight. Drake faces an al—
most equally important assignment, as
a defeat would definitely eliminate the
Bulldogs as a championship contender.
