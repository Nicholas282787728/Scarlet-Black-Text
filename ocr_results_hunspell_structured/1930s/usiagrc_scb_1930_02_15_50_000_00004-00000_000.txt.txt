Brooks outlined the beneficial i-o tire
of the counter reformation, centering
around the Council of Trent~ which
instituted careful education for the
clergy. careful instruction ior its
children. and forwarded a great mid.
sionsry enterprise But it closed its
doors to the incoming of intellectual
light.

After the Reformation, “0n the
continent and in England, old intel-
lectual conditionsistill completed.
But Protestant soil gave chance for
intellectual freedom. Protestantism
succeeded in unsettling the mind, rer
,Viving a realspirit of inquiry. (lull
in reviving interest in this present
world. '

"America began with the trims-
plantation of European types,” said
Dr. Brooks, in making the transition
from his the background of our re-
ligion which he was drawing in the
main theme of the morning. “But
the American Revolution freed Ain-

Scientific Spirit ‘
That of Christ

"Our conception of loans has
changed, and our idea of Christians
ity has changed. but as a man thinks
so is he," said Dr. Raymond c.
Brooks when he spoke in Herrick
chapel on Thursday evening.

Dr. Brooks named the four words
of Jesus’ fold. “Come 'come'untn
me’; fall- ‘fdll with me. ahid . 'stay
with me’: and go. Jesus had the wise
com to never say go to those who
had not come."

“The scientific spirit has come. to
stay," explained Dr. Brooks, “it has
brought some different thlngs' mic
‘our knowledge. It has made us per-
fectly sure of our knowledge. It has
brought us the way in Which we
must see the universe. it has loo “5
into certain principles of living that
we are unconscious of, and we are n
more abiding. universe without imulv-
ingit."

"There is no truer spirit of the fee
1 ion of Jesus than the spirit of the
s entist. ~ What is the true spirit of
science. asked Dr. Brooks. “It is
the open mind, ready to take the
consequences, ready to recognize the
blunders."

Personality Is
Highest

“In personality we have the high
cat form of existence we have yet
discovered; it bridges the gulf he-
twcen the natural and spiritual and
'interwesves them inextricably. Jesus
ﬁrst exempliﬁed this, and the gm t-
‘est contribution of Christianity to the
hresent-day world is its cxaltation
of personality." This was one strikr
ing statement made by Dr. Brooks,
in the third Gates lecture Thumdaly

“Jesus has also given us truth",

said the speaker. ”namely. that our
knowledge of the universe cannot be
certain of it
must come from within. In our re—
lations with our fellowmen, we can
only learn to know them by looking
into their souls, not by ceiling on 2.

dimensions.
God Is Love

“Jesus has given us a key to life

if we dare to use it. He taught us

that ‘God is Love', a truth which we
may verify by realizing that love is

the only creative force in the world.
Standing atthe parting of the roads,
he says. ‘I am the way'.

Dr. Brduks' lecture
fundamental contributions of Jesus
to the civilization of today, elaborat-
ing upon Jesus’ exaltation of person»
silty, of truth. and of God as the key
to life.

He recognized at the beginning

that religion is living in a period to-
day when it is challenged by scient—
ists and a new social mind, and that
religion cannot be independent of the
cultural streams of which
part. Profound thinkers today are
seeking for a religion which will fit
in with our civilization as Christian-
ity did years ago. The theme of the
speaker's address was to point out

ways in which Christianity still held'

for the present-day world, while re-
cognizing that it must undergo many
changes to become a part of twen-
tieth century culture. "
Much Is Accompushed

“We grant that Christianity has
carried a vast amount of excess bag-
gage and has taken on things not in
the mind of Jesus,” he said. "It has
sanctioned every practice which men
have subscribed to, such as war.
Theoretically devoted to truth, the
church has fought every scientiﬁc
advance. But it is 'nct to be forgot-
ten that in every living religion there
tins been a schism and a war. A re-
ligion often makes a contribution in
calling attention to the very mistakes
in it. Christianity has done that."

Stating that in Jesus himself and
in faith in his experience we can find
the clue which can hold together the
end and beginning of life, Dr. Brooks
then proceeded to an analysis of the
contributions of Christianity already
mentioned.

'Truth Is a Discovery’

“Truth," be stated, “is not an ex-

ertion or a sumise, but a discovery.

Man can discover truth because his =

mind is of a type not found in any
other living thing.‘ It reaches be-
yond the chemical, it can discover
beauty, order. power and wisdom in
nature. We have not found the

meaning of man’s existence until we .

The kingdom of Sylvannia some-

Queen (Jeannette MacDonald) is

And when the Queen’s Ambassador

are realized.
‘ But all stories do not end with a
close-up of the altar as most fairy

also a man with a man's dislike of
domination. The complications be-

[Bears Have Nine

Veteran Tankmen

St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 14, (Special)
Nine lettermen reporting and a
wealth of new material give evidence
that Washington university may
have a far better swimming team
than last year. The Bears after
winning the Missouri Valley confer-
ence tank title for six consecutive
years were nosed out by Drake last
year, but present indications are that
Washington will not only be a con-
tender for the title but will stack up
well against several Western con-
ference teams carded for duel meets.

The squad is being coached again
by Karl Bauer who is commencing
his second year as the Washington
mentor. Bauer. a member of the
swimming and Watervpolo teams that
represented Germany in the Olympic
games of 1912, coached the Bears in
1925 and last year.

Although the team this season
may not vary much from last year's
