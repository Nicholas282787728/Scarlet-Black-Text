gnash their teeth when they see
the new college campus diction-
ary compiled by Dean Edward H.
Lauer, of the University of Wash—

hastener to a swing»sesson in a
wheeled-tub," or just taking his
girl to a dance in his car.

History students at Mount Hol-
yoke college have written a pro-
pheey about whither we are drifte

years.
