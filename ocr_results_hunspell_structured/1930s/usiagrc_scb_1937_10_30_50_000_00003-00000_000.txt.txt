By Arthur Goshom

A new means of scoring a goal
in speedball was discovered acci-
dcntally this week, when Langan
and Smith halls met Tuesday. A
Smith player reached high in the
air and batted a kicked ball
through the Langan goal,

'Lunglhn Protests

The Langan team protested the
three points but the officials could
find nothing in the rules against
throwing the ball through the op
ponents' goal. Dibble hall took ad—
vantage of the ruling and scored
against Clark hall on two occa-
sions in this manner Thursday.

Standings were changed very
little after Wednesday's and
Thursday’s games. Dibble strength-
ened its hold on second place by
rolling over Clark with a score of
20 to 1. Thursday. Gates won its
first game of the year and went
into a threeeway tie with Rawson
and Clark halls by defeating
Bawson Wednesday, 12 to 5.

Rawson-Gates

In the Rawson-Gates game,
Rawson took the lead in the first
quarter by scoring five points on
a goal by George Dwelle and a
pass from Edward Harvcy to Wil-
liam Conwill. At the start of the
second period, Gates took over
the offensive and displayed a
passing attack which completely
baffled the Rawson defense. The
victors scored first on a pass
from Charles Carns to Walter
Dawson.

In the third quarter, Carns re-
mained on the throwingl end and
scored twice more on passes to
Thomas Keehn and Merrill Smith,
making the scorc Gates 6, Raw-
son 5, at the end of the period.
Cains opened the fourth quarter
by tossing to Kechn for two
points Keehn followed soon after
by passing to Smith for another
score and then earns ended the

scoring with another pass to
Keehn.

A free kick by James LaMas-
ney in the second period of the
Dibble-Clark game, saved Clark
hall from a shutout Wednesday,
the score being 20 to 1, Dibble
scored seven points in the first
quarter on a goal by Gerald Fort,
a pass from Hal Dean to Dave
Miller, and another pass from
Dean to Fort.

Dibble added two more points
in the second quarter With a pass
from Fred Weatherson to Robert
Young.

Deon Scores

In the third quarter, Dean
passed through the goal for three
points, scored on a free kick, and
caught a pass from Miller to
boost the victors lead. Young
passed to Milo Bodemeyer in the
fourth quarter for two more points
and Dean scored the final three
points with another pass through
the goal.

The final round of games wdl
be played next week with Smith
meeting Rawson, .Clark opposing
Langan, and Gates taking on the
Dibble team. Should smith lose
:tnd Dibble win, the two teams
would end the season in a dead—
lock for first place, necessitating
a playoff which would be tlﬁ
third time the two teams have
met this year. Smith won a pro-
tested game from Dibble after
losing the original battle.

Conflicts Cause
Langan To Cancel
Fall House Party

Because of conflicting events,
Langan hall will not hold its re-
gular fall house party, scheduled
Friday night, according to Julian
Ball, social chairman.

a sleigh ride, however, has
set with an informal party in the
Lang—an club room, replacing the
formal dance, Ball explained.

Ban mentioncd the Iowa home-
coming game, and the fact that
the hall has had too short a
notice for billing a good band.
