NEARLY MISS TRAIN

Thanks to the Rock Island.
the Grinnell cagei-s were able
to get started on time for
Omaha last night. but not uns
til Coach J, C. Truesdale had
caused one false start by ace
cidentally acting as trainmaii.

When the Pioneer mentor
arrived at the station to take
his squad to Omaha last night
he found that not a player was
in sight. A few minutes later,
the train was ready to leave,
while J. C. paced the platform
in anxiety.

Looking up Park street he
could see the 10 cagers slowly
meandering down to the Star
tion, and telling the conductor
to hold the train, he grabbed
the brakeman's lantern and
began to frantically wave at
the playeis up the street,
They didn't see him, but the
engineer did, and taking the
flashing lantern for the “high-
ball" started the train.

Hurriedly the brakeman
swung on board and pulled the
emergency stop signal, while
Ti-uesdale yelled at the plays
ers, Finally he marshalled
them all on board, but not un-
til the conductor has become
more than slightly put out
with the entire affair. The
train left elghtvminutes late.

Creighton’s 17 Game
Winning Streak

Fresh from victoiies over Wash-
burn and Iowa State Teachers'
college last week, the Grinnell
basketball team will attempt to
capture their second conference
win of the season tonight when
they meet the Creighton Bluejays
at omaha in the 17th contest be-
tween the two schools since 1926.
during which time Grinnell has
failed to chalk up any wins.

Ten men will make the trip,
They are: .Iim LaMasney, John
Hayward. Bill Conwill and Vern
Robinson, forwar;ds Wilhul Luick
and Vernon Cornish, centers; and
Hal Dean, Boo Berry, Bill Fow-
ler and Harold High, guards

Probable Lineup

The same lineup, which has piled
up 91 points in the last two
games, will stait against Creigh-
ton, Coach John Trucsdale said
Tuesday. Co-Captain Jim La»
Masney will team with John Hay-
ward at forward, Wilbur Luick
will hold down the center position,
while co Captain Hal Dean and
Bob Berry will function at guar.ds
The team will average six feet,
two and one half inches in height.

Although Gnmiell will have a
sizable height advantage in to»
nights tilt they will be hard put
to it to match the Blue s speed.
Speaiheads of me Creighton at-
tack are Busch and Shaw, foi—
wards, and Rob, center, who have
led the Bluejay’s attack in every
game so far. Luick, with a three-
inch height advantage over Rah,
should be able to keep the tipsoft
well in hand, but it will be a ques-
tion whether or not the Grinnell
defense will be able to match the
