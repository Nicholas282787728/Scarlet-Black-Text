line three times before he finally
drove it across, Vcith scored the
point. The second touchdown

Students Told

to Investigate

Class

Vocations
to Study Jobs

Urged

A study of the occupations in
the world and consideration of the
growing semi-professional fields
were recommended to members of
the vocations class Friday after
noon by Miss Esther stamats of
Chicago and Dr. Gilbert Wrenn of
Minneapolis.

Dr. Wrcnn, for eight years in
the guidance and personnel de—
partment of Leland Stanford uni-
versity and now at the University
of Minnesota, urged the students
to look for possibilities in the new
fields rather than in the tradi-
He also stated
that there are more business op-
portunities in the distribution de-
partments than in production.

Miss Stamats, director of the
service department of the Chicago
Young Women's Christian associa-
tion, advised the seniors to ana-
lyze various occupations in refer—
ence to their own abilities, apti»
tudcs, and limitations.

An outline of requirements for
success as listed by employers was
given by Miss Stamats. This list
included self-confidence, alertness,
morale to carry one through try-
ing situations, ability to get along
with people, and an objective atti-
tude toward one's work. Miss
Stamats added that of 4,000 work—
ers discharged in Chicago, 10 per
cent were fired for lack of skill,
and 90 per cent because of person-
ality traits.

Both speakers recommended the
use of tests to show vocational
aptitudes and interests and dis-
cussion of these tests with a coun-
selor when selecting a vocation.

afternoon for the initial practice
of the season. The cage season
is scheduled to open tWo weeks

good team."

nucleus for the 1936—37 aggrega—
tion. They are Cocaptains James
LaMasncy and Hal Dean, juniors,
who are expected to hold down a
forward and guard berth respec-
