VOTING SUGGESTIONS

(Editorial Board Chairman’s note: This is the
fifth in a series of editorials dealing with student
government. It is the policy of the Scarlet a
Black for all editorials dealing with student gov—
ernmental problems to be drawn up, approved, and
signed by the editorial board.)

. x v s

In past years the election of Student
council president and the heads of various
committees has been relatively ineffective
because students have been at a loss to
know for whom to vote. As a result, many
ballots have been wasted, since the vote has
been scattered among such a large field of
candidates.

There seem to be at least two means by
which the Student council could make the
voting for the president of the council and
for the committee heads more effective.
One way would be for the council to issue a
list of those persons who are eligible for
these positions; thus the student body would
know the names of all qurlified students,
and their votes would not be wasted on
those who, for some reason or another, are
ineligible.

Another way of meeting this problem
would be for the Student council to appoint
a nominating committee; this committee in
turn would select names of students who
seem to them particularly well qualified to
serve in the various positions. There could
be the provision inserted that if students
did not believe thoe persons nominated were
Evell qualified, other students could be voted
01‘.

Both of these suggestions would put
fewer names before the student body for
consideration, and in this way more careful
thought could be given to the ,voting.

SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY?

Twenty years ago (April 6, 1917), the
United States entered a war to end all wars,
a war to make the world safe for Democra-
cy. This year papers of Tuesday morning
caried headlines, “War Crisis: British Cab»
inet Orders Battleship to Fire on Spanish
Rebels ‘If Necessary} ” .

This, then, is the outcome of a war in
which weithe ones who were fighting to
stop all wars and to save Democracy—were
the victors; another war, this time in Spain
with England now definitely involved and
other powers trying covertly to gain some
sort of foothold in the conflict, and a war
'which is certainly a. threat to Democracy.

The crisis arose when the British cabinet
was faced with the problem of whether to
recognize the Spanish rebel fleet as a belli-
gerent by sending naval escort to protect
six British food ships as they carried supv
plies to the starvation blockaded port of
Bilboa. It was reported that Britain had
refused this recognition of belligerency and
that the cabinet might move to have a
protective zone established around Bilbao
as has been done at Barcelona and other
places.

Diplomatic circles revealed that France
would oppose this movement; that he had
said, “We are prepared to risk an inter-
national incident.”

If further reports that “Nationalist Spain
is losing little by little her respect and con-
sideration for the British flag" are true,

then the threatening note of War sounds

THE GRIN'NELL SCARLET AND BLACK

even more clearly. If European nations
continue to gather their fleets about the
powder-keg ports of Spain, sooner or later
there seems to be bound to be a skirmish.
And no matter how trivial the starting
conflict might be, it now seems apparent
that the situation needs only very slight
impetus to become a grave world war. P

“LET’S SIT-DOWN”

The epidemic of Sit-down strikes, which
is creating such a serious situation, has not
been without humorous incidents. The sit-
tlown has become a craze, sweeping the
country in a wave of mass hysteria, com-
parable to the Gold Rush, and the Ku Klux
Klan. Certainly some of the recent uses of
sit-down tactics must have surprised Mr.
Lewis and the officials of the C. I. 0.

When a small group of Stl'ltlllg negro
nurses in Chicago were asked about John L.
Lewis and the C. I. 0,, they furnished the
funniest incident of recent weeks by reply-
ing that they had never heard of him. One
of them asked if the reporters meant Joe
Louis. Equally deflating to Ml Lewis‘s
ago must have been the sitvdown of 600
girls employed by a cigar factory in New
Jersey. They struck for increased wages,
but refused to have anything to do with any
kind of union oganization. In at least one
plant, a model airplane factory, striking
employees were treated to a party by their
fiddle playing president. Among the strange
est strikes was that of the Michigan Nat~
ional Guard troopers, who after the General
Motors strike sat down on the Armory steps
and refused to move until each man received
five dollars for their athletic fund. With
these and similar incidents the seriousness
of the strike situation continues to be treat-
ed lightly by people all over the country.

Other Opinions

OUTSIDE worm
(Daily Trojan)

There are still too many misguided Americans
who believe that the greatest asset a college man
can have is lack of sufficient funds to attend col-
lege in a sane and senslble manner. For successw
and they mean financial success—is attained only
through experiencing sundry hard knocks,

William Allen White, onetime Kansas editor
and famed exponent of the back-breaking, intellect-
stifling, idiotic “work your way through college"
philosophy, recently endorsed this belief as the
“American way."

But must a man who has sufficient intellect to
attend college struggle for long hours to overcome
financial hardships when he should be studying?
Must every successful man “whack a mule on a
towpath during youth's golden hour” when he
should .be studying? And must every successful
man become so physically tired doing outside work
while attending college that he falls asleep while
trying to study?

It is a demonstrated fact that human beings
are capable only of a certain amount of continuous
activity. Work outside of univerSlty assignments
must claim a portion of this energy, and what re
mains goes into class preparation. It is beside the
point that many students who do not have employ-
ment waste time. They would waste time anyway.

The point is that working one’s way through
school has only two results: it provides money for
expenses, it takes time and energy. Character
building and the teaching of thrift and industry
have nothing to do with it.

The student who earns his way through a
university must be given the fullest credit, But
it is to be regretted that he cannot have all of his
valuable time for his course needs.

“Their minds are soft and dormant. They do
not know how to work; they do not know how to
study; they do not know how to reason; they do
not know how to discriminate between the central
core of things and the surrounding trimmings."

There seems to be an increasing awareness
that a person should not only possess information,
but that he should be able to use the information
for discussion and exchange of ideas. The day of
the poor speaker is coming to a close. America
has tolerated more than its share of bad speaking.

fessor of speech reeducation. spells ‘finis' for

Preparations for Dance Pageant
Involve Great Deal of Work

Co-eds Spend Time Sew-
ing, Glueing, Practicing,
and Painting

If you miss your compact or
your best string of glass beads.
you will probably be right in
guessing that your room-mate has
taken them to the women's gymc
uasium to be used in making cos-
tumcs for the (lance pageant. But
it won't do you any good to look
for them for by now they have
been broken to bits and glued on
the skirts of goddesses.

Yes, that queer odor in the
gym is a combination of glue.
paint, and turpentine. And if you
follow your nose into the locker
room, you'll see a table covered
with can after can of paint, bot-
tlcs of turpentine, brushes soak-
ing in kerosene, and newly paint-
ed screens, urns, and altars. Those
wooly things on the bench in the
corner are wigs made of black
yarn.

There is great opportunity for
experimentation in dress design-
ing, too, Just go upstairs and
with the best of models at your
service you can pin and cut and
stitch on a real sewing machine
to your heart's content. You may
even take your choice of sky blue
cheesecloth or rust colored cam~
bric. If neither of those colors
suit you, someone downstairs will
be delighted to dye it pink or yel-
low.

It seems that the first rule after
punctuality is absolutely no idle-
ness after entering either the
chapel or the gym A. reporter
