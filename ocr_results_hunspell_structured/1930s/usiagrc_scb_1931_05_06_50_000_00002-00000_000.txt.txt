DISTINCTION FOR SENIORS
Senior chapels. once on the verge of abandon-
lncnt, are being given a ﬁnal test this year. If they
prove successful, both from the standpoint of at-
tendance and from inspiration to men and women
soon to become alunllli of Grinnell, they will he cons
tinned. Othcri se it is only right that they be

ics can be allowed a place on the ofﬁcial

Seniors have little enough distinction at Grill-
nell. All cndcavor was ollcc made to establish n
senior custom—carrying canes it was at that time

heap. Commencement exercises have alreadv been

Perhaps emphasis on senior distinction is not
a good thing. The almlislilnent of ”prepping". ole
though ccmainly a wise move, ltclpcd eliminate lhc
distinction between class groups. The few tradi~

A MALADY: A REMEDY

Powers Hapgood, whose address at Dos hlnines
was reported at length in the Monday De, )loilics
Register, is unique among the critics of capitalism.
Like many socialists, he sees a malady: too much
is owned by too few. Unlike many ra cals, lm h-
a practical constructive program for remedying
the situation.

Mr. Hapgood tells about the factory in Colum-
bus with which he has been associated, owned and
operated by employees. They are paid annual snlr

WHO SETS STANDARDS?
(From the Hardin county Citizen)

This paper in no way begrudges Knute Rockne his
many tributes, but somehow the death of President Main
of Grinnell with scarcely a parting notice leaves with
one a feeling of sadness. Has our country come to this—
:hat education is of so little importance and athletics of
so great importance? Who sets these standards? Do
the fathers and mothers of boys and girls set them?

SUPPOSING TRADITIONS DIE
(From the Daily Trojan)

The Daily Californian last week commented sadly
on dying university traditions with particular reference
to its own. Enthusiasm, the Californian maintains, “can
not be instilled by organized methods. Furthermore,
traditions having been sponsored by such enthusiasm
do not call for rules to enforce them . . . Obviously
halt-hearted rooting and enforced ‘traditions’ by means
of vigilance committees defeat their own purpose since
it is human nature to try to succeed in breaking as many
rules as possible. If left to our own resources to support
our university and maintain our traditions we could
make a better showing.“

The»Caiirornian attributes a lack of spirit on its
own campus to “Would‘oe sophistication” growing out
of the university's proximity to a large metropolitan
district. "Obviously," it says, "such sophistication is
merely'adolescent . . . That traditions are still carried
on by a few students is not because they are forced
to do so but. because they have an advanced understand
ing of the meaning of real collegiate sophistication."

There seems to be some freedom in the Californian's
use of the Word sophistication, but we doubt that the
so-called sophisticated attitude has less to commend it
than the co-cailed collegiate attitude. The former can
be somewhat of a sham and the latter can be farcial, de»
pending on the outlook, There is ample reason for either,
but in universities surrounded by metropolitan districts
there is much virtue in interests apart from those. de-
noted by shouting rah, rah.
