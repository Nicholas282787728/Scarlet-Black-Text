defeating Dibble hsll, 471, in a
hard fought game played Tuesday.

Heaﬁ—Waiterﬁ
Inaugurates
New System

Men Required to Dress
for Evening Meal
by New Plan

Numerous changes have been
made in the system of wa ing
tables in the dormitory dining
room by Lewis Van Nostrand,
newly appointed head waiter,

Each of these changes has been
made in order to secure more efﬁ-

confusion
in the

to help prevent the
which has been prevalent
dining hall.

Change System

The major change is that of hav-
ing two waiters take care of four
tables rather than one waiter for
each two tables. Under this plan,
which is identical with the one
used at the quadrangle dining
room, one waiter carries the trays
while the other is in the dining
room loading the trays and look-
ing after the service.

A second major change is the
decision to serve luncheon 10 min-
uates later, beginning the service
at 12:25 o'clock instead of at
12:15. This change was made in
order to give the waiters a chance
to get the food on the tables before
the dining room fills. In conjunc-
tion with the change in time, it
was also decided to have the men
eat at their regilar evening table
assignments instead of at any
table they choose, as has been the
custom in the past. Both of these
changes have been made in order
to eliminate some of the confusion
connected with serving the noon
meal.

Suggests Other Changes
A number of other changes have
been suggested by Van Nostrand
for consideration by the various
house presidents in an attempt to
loreate better manners and con-
duct in the dining room.

He suggests that everyone he
required to wear a coat and tie
to dinner, and that regular table
heads be appointed by the house

Pioneers Open
Home Season
Next Friday

lchabods Will Make Bow
in Valley Grid

Competition

By Jim Bradley

The washburn college gridders
of Topeka, Kan, will make their
debut in the Missouri Valley eon-
ferencc Friday night at 7 :45 o’clock
on Ward field when they encoun-
ter the Pioneers in Grinnell's open-
ing loop game.

washburn college was made a
member of the Missouri Valley
conference more than a year ago,
after the 1934 grid schedules were
completed.

Boast Two victories

The Ichabods, already boasting
victories over Baker university and
Emporia State Teachers, will come
here intent upon only one thing,
that of making their initial loop
appearance an impressive one.
Their line will outweigh the Grin-
nell wall by 13 pounds, their line
average being 139 and Grlnneli's
171, however, the Pioneer banks
will outhalance the Ichabod ball
carriers, the local backs averaging
111, and Washburn 168.

Washburn’s weight and Michi-
gan State's overwhelming victory
over the Pioneers last week will
mean ‘very little, for the Gi-innell
players are victory hungry and
will trot onto the field to whip,
not merely to hold, Washburn.
Evidence of a new attitude was
shown Tuesday when the Pioneers
fought and clawed each other
through an hour‘s scrimmage.
Coach Watt watched eagerly and
