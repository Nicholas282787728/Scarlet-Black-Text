Campus Opinion

Question: Do you favor exeusing
seniors from their last semester fiunl
examinations?

Fri-n Tcgct: Yes, though I feel
that it should be left to the discre»
tion of the professor whether or not
the students grades permit him to
be excused.

Marjorie Marker: Yes, indeed.
seniors should be excused from final
exams. By their senior year the
majority of students are sufficiently
interested in their work to have an
adequate uncle standing of their
courses without being forced to
write examinations.

Joyful Jones Yes, I am thorough-
ly in favor of it. Seniors are respon-
sible enough to study without being
required to pass an examination
over the work.

Dorothy lson: Surely for slur
dents who have satisfactorily col-m
plated the college work which has
brought them to the final stagc of
their senior, final examinations are
anomalous. Thcy merely prove an
unecessary addition to the strain
and tension of commencement thus
mitigating whatever value they
might have had detracting from
what should be a happy time for the
graduating class.

Blanche llulselius: Final examina-
tions are unnecessary except for
those seniors who have not done
satisfactory work in their courses.
Exemption from examinations would
he left to the judgment of the pro»
fessor.

Miss Koglin: Senior exams are all
right for those whom there is any
doubt. Students who have been
getting satisfactory grades for four
years aren't likely to flunk the last
minute and should be allowed to
forego the pleasure of final exumiuur
tions.

Miriam MacNally: I have always
thought that our system of giving
final examinations to seniors is an
unjust imposition on the autgoingh
glass. If it is deemed necessary to
give seniors final exams it seems
only just that special tests be given
them at an earlier date, and not
crowded in with the rush of pre-
commenoement activities. Personal»
ly I believe that seniors of high
grade standing could be exempt
without detriment to the morale of
the school or to their own scholastic
standards.

Mr. Kennedy said that the new

pilots to have licenses to operate

license was sufficient to ﬂy any type

that the government intends to keep
