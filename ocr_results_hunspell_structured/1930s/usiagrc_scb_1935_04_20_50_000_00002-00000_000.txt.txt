A NEW REGIME

Today’s issue of The Scarlet and Black marks
the beginning of a new administration. How»
ever, the new regime does not intend to follow the
usual political custom of turning things upside
down upon entering office, but rather we hope to
continue along lines laid down by our predecess—
orsi

We intend to indulge in no crusading efforts,
but rather to endeavor to give the student body
a paper which they can truly consider: as being
their own and a representative one as well We
will welcome any suggestions as to how the paper
may better serve the interests of the students on
the campus. Especially do we suggest that
more of our readers take advantage of the “Let-
ters to the Editor" column which is ever ready
to run whenever someone has a legitimate com-
plaint or opinion which he or she desires to ex-
press publiclyt This is one feature of the pa~
per which we feel has been neglected in the past,
not by the editors, but by the readers who have
not taken advantage of this standing offer.

In the field of campus politics we intend to
follow the policy of opposing the continuation of
needless and defunct organizations and class of-
fices which have no real use, A start along this
line has been made with the abandonment of 'of—
floor: by the sophomore class and the abolition of
the Lantern, but there is still room for much pro-
gress, However, we do not intend to devote our
sole attention to this phase of campus life, but
will endeavor to present a well-balanced program
which will be guided by the needs of the cam-
pus.

To the outgoing administration may we say
just a word, You have had to encounter great
difficulties;. yet in spite of them you have given
the readers a very efficient administration and
if we can duplicate your achievements we shall
not feel that the coming year will have been spent
in vain.

IS GRINNELL STIFF'!

How stiff is Grinnell is a question much dis-
cussed, not only among students who go here but
among those who go elsewhere as well. Quite
naturally one maintains that his or her school
is the stiffest when it comes to grading, not only

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

because of school loyalty, but also because it does
no harm to one’s reputation as a scholar to main-

‘tain such a claim,

By comparison with the average grade per»
centages revealed in a recent survey of the grades
in 43 colleges and universities, Grimell rates
high. In fact, so far do the grade percentages of
of Grinnell professors fall below the averages of
the report, the term of ‘stiff grading” might be
quite appropriately applied.

In the 43 schools reporting in the survey, the
average percentage of As awarded was 13.5 per
Cent, while Grinncll's was 15.5. However, when
the Grinnell average was analyzed, it was found
that 31 members out of the 53 listed on the grade
report for the first semester were below the sur~
vey in percentage average of As awarded. In oth-
er words 58.4 per cent of the Grinnell professors
awarded less than the 13.5 per Cent of As given by
instructors whose grades were used in the per-
centages compiled for the survey. In addition four
members of the faculty saw fit to award no As at.
all thus making the percentage of instructors who
graded more severely than those in the report
64.1.

Not only did Grinnell instructors grade more
stiffly in the matter of As, but they did likewise
in the awarding of B5. The survey showed that the
percentage of Bs awarded was 33.4; yet 33 mem-
bers of the faculty had less than that percentage
of 85 on the grade reports, Thus figured in
percentage, 62.2 per cent of the Grinnell profes-
sors saw fit to award a lower percentage of Bs than
averaged from 43 schools included in the report.

Altogether, figuring both As and Bs, over 60
per cent of the Grinnell professors averaged a
lower percentage of high grades than the average
reported in 43 schools. Yes, Grinnell is stiff.

A NEW INVESTIGATION

The Illinois legislature is the latest recruit
in the ranks of the “red-baiters.” Last Wed~
nesday night the state senate voted an investi-
gation of alleged radical activities in Illinois Col-
leges and universities, to be made by a committee
of five state senators.

Just what. will constitute “radical activities"
and “propaganda” has not been determined as yet.
Very likely during the course of the investigation,
the worthy senators who, it is to be hoped,‘are
all college graduates, will find that although it is
easy to make vague charges, it is extremely dife
ficult to put one’s finger down upon any student
activity and call it ”radical.” ls taking part in
a strike against war, radicalism? Hardlyi
Rather, it is merely and exercise of the right to
assemble peacably, as guaranteed by the Consti-
tution. Can a college be accused of radicalism
when it invites a man of socialistic or communis—
tic beliefs to speak on the campus? This would
seem to be an exercise of the right of free speech.
If a campus newspaper upholds the principle of
teaching, does it mean that the paper is danger-
ously radical, and should not be allowed to make
such statements? No. It would appear that
this is an exercise of the ancient right of freedom
of the press.

Examined in the light of reason, most of
these so>called radical activities to which the Ill»
inois legislature objects, turn out to be perfectly
legal and legitimate means for an intelligent
search for the truth. It is very doubtful whether
any startling revelations will. be made in the in-
vestigation, although the affair will be played up
by sensational newspapers, and the true- situa-
tion will no doubt be distorted by prejudice by
the time it reaches the general public.

, All in all, however, we believe that the in—
quiry will have a good effect. It will enable the
schools to present their side of the question, which
hitherto they have had little opportunity to ex-
press publicly. It will be an opportunity for
them to show the utter lack of foundation upon
which most of the charges of radicalism are bas-
cd. Perhaps, it will help to end this foolishness

'which today is sweeping the country, and troubl-

ing our solemn legislators, causing deep concern

among them over the future of our country. ' If

it can accomplish these ends it will be a good
~R.W.

Hanna Outlines
Possible Duties
of Newspapers

A plea for newspapers to present all
the facts in a story was voiced by
Phil 5. Hanna, editor of the Chicago
Journal of Commerce at the Fourth
Annual All.lowa Founders Day meet.
ing of state Sigma Delta Chi chapters
Thursday evening in Des Moines. In
discussing “Journalism’s Duty in Re.
Covery.” he pointed out that if journal.
ism had done its duty in the past, per.
haps, we wouldn‘t be wondering what
it should do in the future,

The danger of not including all the
facts is all txio common in journalism.
Just recently a prominent business
Iorecasting house issued a “bullish
statement," he said; yet 25 out of
29 business men, when interviewed,
issued statements which contradicted
the forecast. Thus, if we had printed
the forecast, we should have been pre—
senting an unfair picture of business
conditions, Hanna explained \

Sectional Nationalism

In commenting upon the spread of
”Buy at. Home" movement in various
sections of the country, Mr. Hanna
pointed out that this is nothing but
another form of economic nationalism,
and it will have the same disastrotn
results within the country that it does
between nations. It is the duty of the
newspapers to get the people to think
about just such an issue as this and
in so doing present both sides of the
question, he continued.

The government. has entered busi.
ness, and in reality is the biggest
business in the country; yet it renders
no adequate reports of the conduct of
its affairs to its stockholders who are
the tax—payers, Hanna declared. Busi—
ness is now required to render deta
ed reports as no the conduct of affairs
whenever a new stock or bond issue
is floated, why then should not the
government do the same? be queried.

Labor nnnnces

Continuing his remarks, he question.
ed why labor organizations should
not be compelled to reveal the hand.
ling of their finances. 1f the labor
organizations have nothing to hide,
they can show their books, but if
they can not do so the sooner they
are exposed the better, he declared.

Twelve members of the Grinnell
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi attended
“the meeting. The men attending were:
James Gallagher, Max Hunn. Carl
Niemeyer, Ralph Lane, Malcorn
Thompson, Ted Klein, Howard Whit.
ney, Allen Cooper, Ted rate, Ralph
Glidden, William Browning, Robert
Kenyon.

Howard Whitney, Grinnell pledge,
was initiated along with several other
pledges from Iowa chapters at the
annual initiation held before the din.
ner meeting.
