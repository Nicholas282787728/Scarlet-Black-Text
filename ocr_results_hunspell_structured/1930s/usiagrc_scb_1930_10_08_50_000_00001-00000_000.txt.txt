Five of 50 Cars

Here Registered
With Treasurer

Despite the announcement made
from the treasurers ofhce in last
Saturday's Scarlet and Black that
although cars are not prohibited on
the campus this year they must be
registered, a checkup Monday showed
that only ﬁve students had registered
their cars.

It has been estimated that there
are in the neighborhood of 50 cars
on the campus. No definite time has
been set when cars must be regis-
tered, but all are requested to ﬁle
their names and car numbers with the
college treasurer as soon as possible.
Reports at the college ofﬁce showed
that last spring a total of 30 cars
were on record. Owners of cars that
were not registered last spring must
pay a fee of 31.

An attempt to learn what the reg
istration fees will be used for dis-
closed no deﬁnite arrangement, but
Shelton L, Beatty, dean of
men and under whose admin-
istration the plan of permitting
registered student cars on the cam-
pus has gone into effect, says he
hopes the approaches to the north
and South road east of the dormi-
tories can be ccncreted this year with
the car registration fees.

Night Football, 768 Women Trying to Lose Weight,
Electric Exercisers Jarring 1,152 Pounds--- What?

 

Current Used for Game Here
Sufficient for More

Than That

You don’t think night football has
anything to do with 768 fat ladies?
Or perhaps it would he better to be
more delicate and say: “With women
who are reducing?"

It has been discovered by an in-
quisitive investigator in Gdansk that
there is a possibility Lhat 768 women
could lose 1,152 pounds of weight
during a game on Ward ﬁeld, and it
is all because of the new lighting
system.

Electric Exercisers Needed”

The electric Current which it takes
to operate the battery of 16 flood-
lights during a regulation football
game would, he declares, operate 768

 

electric exercisers for a sufﬁcient
length of time to jar one and one-half
pounds of excess ﬁesh from each of
768 women.

in tbe terms of an electrical man,
Ward ﬁeld's night lighting system
used 96 kilowatts of electricity dur-
ing a game, A kilowatt equals 1,000
Watts. A watt is the rate of work
represented by a current of one amr
pere under a pressure of one volt.
All of which means nothing to the
average, normal human being, so to
deﬁne as kilowatts in more interest-
ing fashion, let us say:

$4.80 Cost Per Game

The 54.80 worth of elcctricity used
for the Iowa. Wesleyan game. which
represents the cost of the so kilo-
watts, would keep one 50 watt bulb
burning in each room of 354 ﬁve
room houses for 60 minutes. In case
it was house cleaning time, 1,230
vacuum cleaners could be run over
rugs for one hour, and the current

 

 

used would be the same as the total
amount coming onto Ward field for
two hours.

Save the 9G kilowatts needed for
a night football game here, and you
could run your electric toaster con-
tinually for 20 days.

Scorcll'mg From 1in Irons

Suppose your appetite called for
waffles! For 160 hours you could bake
them, if the college wrapped up the
electricity coming through the wires
at Ward ﬁeld for a night game and
gave it to you to run the waffle iron.
Think of thc scorching that 160 irons
could do in an hour: They would use
current equal to 96 kilowatts.

Would you rather lose weight,
light your home, clean your rugs, run
the toaster, cook wafﬂes, or iron
clothes? The kilowatts of light used
on Word ﬁeld over a two hour period
would furnish more then enough
electricity for any one or several of
those things for days or weeks.

Parent-Teacher Speaker

Prof. J. I’. Ryan will be the prin-
cipal speaker at the central district
parent»tellcher's roundtable, to be
held tomorrow in the Grlnnell high
school auditorium, His subject will
be “The 12. T. .A. and the Educor
tional Machinery."

Class Scrap is
Next Monday

Under Classmen Will Battle
Beneath New Floodlights

on Gridiron

Crinnell coeds will at last have an
opportunity to view the freshman-
sophomore class scrap this year, al-
though it will not be in the same form
as in the past. The council of house
chairmen decided at a meeting last
night to hold the scrap at 9 p.m,
Monday on Ward ﬁeld, The ﬂood-
lights will be turned on during the
battle. ,

Fifteen sacks of sand, varying from
50 to 70 pounds in weight, will be
lined up in midﬁeld, and the object
of the scrap will be to carry the sacks
to the opposite goal line. The class
having the most sacks at the ope
posite goal when the battle is over
will be adjudged the winner.

The tussle will continue for 30 min
utes, 10 minute halves being allowed
with n 10 minute intermission be—
tween. The six house chairmen will
serve as referees. Freshman and
sophomore football men will not be
eligible.

Under this new system the class
scrap will not only he an all-college
affair, but there will be less chance
of injury since slugging will be pro
hibited. Formerly the scrap consisted
of a chase from a pm. to 2 am and
a half hour battle at 6 am. between
the members of the classes who had
not been bound the night before. The
trad' ional battle was not held last
year.

Women’s Athletic Group
to Have Sports Play Day
‘Next Saturday Morning

Play day for all Crinnell women
will be observed next Saturday. It is
sponsored by the Women’s Athletic
association and consists of a. non-
competitive sports program.

This is a universal idea which is
being tried at 'd number of schools
over the country. The University of
Iowa had a Women's play day Satur»
day.

Every woman may have her choice
of sports: tennis, hrchery, volleyball.
newcomb, punchball, and dodgeball,
or she may play several different
ones. All participants will be assigned
to a team as they go on the field. but
do not necessarily need to know how
to play. '

The program starts at 10 and lasts
until lunch time, after which tenta~
tive plans have been made for a pic-
nic lunch.

Women will be dressed in gym
Clothes. In case of rain, the play day
will be held in Rand gymnasium.

More than 100 Children attended
the funeral for a horse in Hickman,
Ky.

 

Detroit Mentor Bewails Lack
of Stiff Opposition for Titans
in Two Early Season Games

Point - a - Minute Conquests
Fail in Impressing

aiilmclx Il'iirldl/ is outlined in the

By w. w. EDGAR
(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

DETROIT—~In two games the Uni—
vcrsity of Detroit football squad has
piled up 110 points without much ef-
fort while holding the opposition,
Adrian and Albion. to two first
downs.
Despite this showing the Titan
coaches always are hard to please,
but to the layman it would appear
that a team able to average a point
a minute, would be satisfactory to
the most exacting builder of football
machines. '

‘Ullknow‘n Quantity

This is not the case with Coach
Dorais and his staff. They are disap<
pointed, not because the team has not
shown ability, but because it is still an
unknown quantity under ﬁre of hard
competition. When the games with
Adrian and Albion were scheduled
they were looked upon as the usual
warmup contests that would enable
the coaches to judge the worth of
their material.

1nstead of furnishing a true test
neither Adrian or Albion offered the
sort of resistance expected and for
that reason the coaches are disap-
pointed when' Adrian was conquered
59 to o, in the opening game
a week ago, the coaches felt that Al-
bion would supply the sort of com-
petition required. But the Method-
ists failed, being made the victims
of a 51 to 0 defeat last Friday night,

Look to Grinnell Game

After the Albion encounter Coach
Dorais sat in his office in the field
house and bemoaned the tum events
had taken. "I had hoped to see my
boys put to a real test," he said,
