Ah. . . Progress!

One of the more interesting aspects of working on
a college publication is the opportunity offered of reading
the mail. Generally, these blurbs from this or that group
are of little value and even less interest. But the other day
several items of more than passing interest were dropped
in the mail box, and we thought we’d pass them along.

The first was a book publisher’s blurb, heralding the
publication of another “how-to" book, this one by an ex-
college student, telling how he slept his way to a B.A. He
invented his own contraption for learning While asleep, it
seems, and is just bursting with a desire to tell the World
how he did it. (We assume he isn’t at all interested in
royalties.)

The second was quite similar. A Dr. A. E. Johns, of
the Modem Coue Institute, has invented a method of ”in-
creasing learning capacity . . . even in sleep." He has also
invented a machine, to be used in applying his method,
called the JohnsOphone, which costs only $27.50 plus tax.

Tossing those two gems aside, we came upon the
clincher. IF magazine (science fiction, of course) is offers
ing vast amounts of cash to college students who Win their
contest. All they want to know is what the world will be
like in another hundred years, in ten to twelve thousand
words.

That’s an sizable number of words, and our small Web-
ster doesn‘t fill the bill, but in a few paragraphs we can
give a fair prediction of Grinnell college, vintage 2054.

Samuel J. Wassom, III, will be manager of the book-
store, and will have a monopoly on the sale of JohnsOphone
in Grinnell. The machine will cost $27.50, plus tax, plus a
markup of uncertain size, which everyone knows about, but
no one can do anything about.

Students will be fighting a pitched battle with the ad-
ministration, attempting to allow honor students unlimited
activity time. The rule that each student must spend 18
hours in bed each day will probably chafe quite a few
athletes.

Professors will rankle at the familiar plaint: “I put the
wrong record on," or “The fuse blew agai ” Communica-
tion, of course, will be by closed circuit televlslon.

It sounds wonderful. Wonderful enough to make the
cynic hope for an atomic war to end all life. Just one thorny
problem remains. What do you do if the power fails?

'Por’rrail' in Black' Is Success

Play Called 'Suspense-Filled'

by Roger Perry

“Portrait in Black,” being presenmd this Week in the Arena
theatre, proved to be an interesting melodrama with a surprise
ending, similar to the O’Henry touch. Unlike many melodi‘amas,
the antagonist in this play is the “mystery-man" who is finally
unveiled in the last scene. Until this point the audience plays a
guessing game With the characters, trying to solve the mystery
of ”who/did it.” And believe me if you do guess the villain, you’ve
either read the play, been told the ending, or else you're just
plain lucky.

Dear Younker Scholars: 1

Many of you and your pan,
ems have been kind enough to‘
write me friendly letters of ap—
preciation during the year. I
would like very much to an-
swer each one individually but
lack of time and the energy to;
do so. However, 1 want all of.
you to know that 1 am grateJ
ful for your thoughtfulness and
appreciate your friendly letters.

1 hope you will continue to
write me and let me know how
you are taking advantage of the‘
opportunities at Grinnell.

My brothers and i. chose‘
Grinnell as the best institution
in the middle west. We believe
that investing in young men and
women was the most profitable
way in which we could extend
more influence in the years
past. I am glad that many of‘
you are profiting from our good
intentions.

Grinnell college offers an ex-

to have proven that you can’t
legislate intolerance, either.
Here's the case in point:

The c of HP has been hand
ing out dining room fines as if
they were campaign platforms.
The rules have been legislated;
the rules state that dress should‘
conform to definite standards.‘
But what has happened? Has the
c of HP succeeded in establish-
ing the social viewpoint that the
rules are based upon?

No. Many men, even if they
do not flagrantly violate din-
ing room dress regulations,
dress as shabbily as possible
and still stay within the pale
of legal restrictions.

Theoretcally, dress standards
are good because they are so-
cially expected. People learn to
be intolerant of violators. But

an obvious answer is available.
College masculinity codes, high
cleaning bills, high clothing
costs, the time that it takes to
”dress up" 7 these and other
factors influence the prevailing
dining room indifference to
“good" dress.

Whatever the causes are,

c of HP fines can be succe§-
ful only when the sloppy
dressin- begins to feel uneasy.
‘While extremely casual dress
is treated with indifference
and sometimes with amuse-
ment — as it is now — then

c of ur fines can serve only
to provide funds for worthy

c of up projects, such as
beci- busts.

But before we lose sleep about
what the causes are and if
there is an intelligent, econom-
ical Way to change them, let us
consider if it’s worth it.

I don‘t think so. There's not
a man in the dining room who
doesn‘t understand what the ac-
cepted dress is e meaning dress
according to the undiscriminat~
ing but explicit dining room
regulations. These rules tell us
not to wear checkered sport

how to use styles, colors, etc. in
a fashionable way. Laws Can't
do that successfully, anyway,
especially since not all of us are
millionaires.
So, if the men already know
everything the rules can teach
them, I say the rules are use-
less. Trying to stick to an
artificial rule can lead to
snobbishness and the reaction-
ary, deliberate sloppiness that
is now the rule.
....If and ..whcn men ..wa.nt to
dress up, the c of HP will have
little or nothing to worry about;
in the meantime it seems that
worry is a waste of time and
dollar fines.

if another way can be found
to encourage dresscconsciousness
_ presumably to prepare all us
farm boys for the ways of the
city _ then effort might be
worth the trouble, artificiality

 

 

notwithstanding.
