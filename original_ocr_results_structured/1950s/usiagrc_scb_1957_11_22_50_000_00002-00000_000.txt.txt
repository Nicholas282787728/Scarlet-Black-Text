Need student Opinion

Bowen propascd an organiza-

which he iclt its potentialities

proposal upon the. inherent ad.
vantages and disadvantages of
student government, and upon

he said. Student opinion is

topics as admi ions polic~ and

in the numbers of stlldenls seek-

The president pointed out
that faculty discussions are
usually compromises between
diiiering opinions, and th -
are more conservative than
any spc c opinions. Thcrc-
rorc, the result oi student
study an particular problems

ions, Speaking on po ihle
deterioration in thc qua i y or
education, he said that as
more students seek higher eds
ucatioii in coming years, those
who are discontent with cone
ditions on their uwn campuses
will ﬁnd it harder to trans—
ier to other campuses. At the
same time, increased enroll.
mci s will strain educational
tiici tics, and lend to iletcriors
ntiou tendencies.

In the present system in most
colleges and universities it is
the seniors who are most active
in the higher levels ot student
government. However. it is also
the smilois who are most con-
cerned with.studies and post
graduate plans, Bovren pointed
out He urged the use or soplms

minor issues.

Another criticism was of
student government’s desire to

committees He pointed out
that the raculty group cun—
trols the definite majority on
such committees and that stu-

are undervalued. He express-

The president criticized a
lack of "home \lork" on the
