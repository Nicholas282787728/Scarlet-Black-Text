Coach Brown said he was
unable at this time to tell who
would be the starting four but
he did say that this year's team
,was banking on the sophomore
class, He lost all four of his
starters from last year so the
team lacks experience.

The squad will have a meet
every week after the Drake con-

will be against Cornell.

Coach Brown wants to see
“any guy who is going to par—
ticipate in varsity football next
year who is not already out
for a spring sport.” The spring
drills will stress fundamentals
and many scrimmages,
