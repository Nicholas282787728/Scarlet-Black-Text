it will be whisking about in sheets Monday and Tuesday'

. ls. But spirits and cross spirits that administration
a 1 student leaders have been trying to impregnate us with
ce we arrived on tllis campus as green, and unspirited,
fleshmen:
The multitude of spirits we refer to are the hall and cot-
'e spirits, the game spi the cooperative sp , the
l lit of fair play, the spill of gratitude, and spil ts ad
' initum uhich at olle time or another are presented to
, . as bn essential of living together in our college coin-
.Luily. _ ,
One spi t seemed useless to us, but it too was thrown
and at us with all the rest. This is class spirit.
On investigation of the whys and wherefores of class
cels, projected class spirit; and class parties we found
good logical reason for it all. >
The sellior clas officers who were elected last spring
l serve as the ol 'cers of the class [or the rest of their
‘ es. The one thing that may change this is the possibility
another electioll of permanent class officers which'is
he :1 in the spring at the discretion of the class. If a separ
ﬁe election is held for permanent class officers, these peo—
remain as the officers of their class as long as they live.
Many people, alld we’re not blameless ourselves, have
bought class spirit an unnecessary addendum to an al-
' y complex organizational set—up. A school as small as
- already seemed well organized along dormitory lines,
A close examination of the situation reveals that there is
a celiliite place for each of the various class functions.
Senior class officers take on the responsibilities of pre-
llig for commencement week.
Ill the past, here as other places, the junior class has
' en responsible for the yearbook. The yearbook is in the
aids of the board of publication now as a result 0" ineffi-
Cle it handling in years past under class auspices

The class ties that freshmen make when starting here ‘

as a body in freshman week are obvious. The administra-
fK-i hopes these ties will.have strength and develop from
if lulnan days to fulfill the duties of the upperclasses men~
timed

In addition to the classes functioning individually in
their own ways there are general responsibilities they fill.
Ole of the most important is ill supplying members of the
Student Council’s central committee. As working members
(i the council and an executive board which spends the semi
fer— money allotted to student activities, they are expected
ti rlo a serious job. For this reason, the class president and
\. -president double as central committee members for
thell' classes. The bigness of the job assures getting capable
p ile.

At certain times, class spirit is essential. This weekend
is one of those times. The national average of withdrawal
(-' students from college between their l'resllman and sen»
ic. years is 5 . At Gl-inliell it is 45%. When these
433% return for commencement alld homecoming, many will

acr‘llﬂlllted in the hall that they would feel at home ill it

r being gone two, especially twcllty, years. These pee-s

have a class tie that is much stronger than bonds estabe
ed in their halls, .

With the school drawing them back occasionally, it

Calling All i-Men

We nrlv never have an all—girl football team at Grill-
hell, but if the present state of things is -any indication the
women will soon have taken over nearly every other area
of campus affairs. 3 ,

What we are getting at is the well-supported iact that
the gi 5 here Seem to have about thlee hundred per cent
more spirit for all the more solid aspects of college livingl
than do the menu Look at last year’s grade list: The women
were ahead all down the line. Regard the now llotoriousl
UH shot incident, where more than half the men had to be,
called in for an extra session while the women had appear-
ed in almost I‘llll iorce the first time the shots hadbeen,
announced. ‘ .

The same thing is true in the support offered to extra-
vurricular activities. We are likely not to have a yearbook
and a magazine, largely becallse the men hare not support-
ed Cyclone and Arena by buying subscriptions, while the,
girls in some halls have bought over sixty per cent. The‘;
Community Chest .drive on,north campus, well supported to‘
the south, was a resounding flop. Women predominate in
organizations, in publications, ill play—acting. In short, wom—
en are taking over, in the spirit, if not in the flesh. ‘

Whether this lamentable situation among the men is:
due to some subtle enliu brought about by a threatenedi
call to arms, or whether it is due to sheer laziness, we cane
not hope to say, But if the present state of affairs‘ con-
tilllles, this paper predicts that we will have, and deserve
to have, a woman president in 1960, be she Democrat, Re-
publlcnn, or Feminist.
