the play, it would be the script.

play with Dickens’ better known
“Christmas Carol," and it Sui»

considerably in the third, giving
promise of a smoother.f1owing
performance throughout for to.

Out of a cast of fifteen, ten of

Dick Lowe was quite good in
his dual role; and his sister,

ened the conference with the

tion counselors and will attend

cial memberships are now being
sold for $10. These memberships,

on the semester memberships
and those people who purchase
them will be non voting meme

the regular system which is also
still in effect. Under the regu—
lar systems of purchasing meme

divtdual buys a share for $50.
This share can be resold to the
club at any time and a refund
Will be made. However, the
cash value of the share de»
creases $10 at the end of the
first year and is for each addi-
tional year.

is conlined only to men. It has
been shown in the past that
many of the women make
excellent pilots, The club is es.
pecially interested in obtaining
the interest of those who reside
on south'campus.
