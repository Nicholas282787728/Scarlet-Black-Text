L/aolies Discuss
Drinking Rule,
Evolve Plans

Revision of the women's
drinking rule was discussed at
a meeting for girls over 2l

years of age in Main drawrng
l‘odm Wednesday evening.

Suzanne Warner, chairman of
the committee investigating pos—
sibilities for a change, presented
ideas which have taken shape
thus far. She explained that the
aim was to allow girls who are
of age to drink as allowed by
state law. She brought up the
idea. of a double standard ap-
plying to similar groups of men
and women on campus and de-
elated “that while this discus—
sion hinges on drinking, if it
were voting or any other ques-
tion covered by law, I shouldn’t
believe our privileges would be
automatically removed on en—
rollment."

Approximately forty girls at.
tended the meeting. Before con-
tinuing to carry plans to the
League Board, administration,
or parents, a show of hands was
called to see if the girls pres-
ent were in accord with such a
plan. No one signified opposition.

Tentative plans include a let
ter to parents asking for a vote.
It would require a simple ma~
jority of parents of 21 years old
girls to change the rule. From
there the question would go to
the administration and trustees.

June 3 To Soy
Repea+ Show
Oi IUp ATree'

Campus funny man. Stu Roe-
der, and his cast of 70 singers,
dancers, 4 “psycho" cases, and
a tree or two, are going to do
a repeat performance of the
home grown musical comedy
”Up a Tree" during commence-
ment week.

The production is planned for
5:30 pm, June 3, in the high
school auditorium.

The comedy is a satire on Col—
lege life at Grinnell with a side
plot involving J. B. Grinnell
and his wife. Held together by
some songs, some dancing on the
part of Janie Slichter and Chet
Lacy, and a laugh or two at the
expense of campus romance, the
play weaves through a day at
Grinnell. It starts with a scene
in the dorms in the morning
and moves through scenes in
the classrooms, the union, the
locker room, the “Three E’s,"
and ends happily on the steps
of Main hall at night,

Along with this “command
performance" of ”Up a Tree,"
Gadabouts plan a Spring Day
carnival and the annual spring
prom to wind up its season.

Originally scheduled for Sat.
urday, May 13, the carnival has
been shifted to the afternoon
and evening of Spring Day.
Tentative plans include halls
sponsored booths in ARH class
roms, for which cash prizes will
be awarded, a ferris wheel, and
street dancing.

The spring formal will be
held May 27 in Darby. A gate
den party theme will be develr
oped for the decorations.

The honor system was de-
Clsively defeated in the voting
Tuesday. April 4.

Figuring on a student bddy of
mo, it would have been neces
sary for 878 students to vole
for the honor system to achieve
the required threeefourths ma—
jority. In a turnout disappoint—
ing to the committee, only 701
persdns Voted, That is a 68 per
Cent vote.

or the ballots cast, 383

voted against the honor sys»
tem, 318 for it. The ballots
provided room to list reas—
ons for voting against the
system so that satisfactory
changes might be made in
case of a fe-vote. One hun-
dred and forty people gave
reasons ranging from “It
Stinks" to moral and ethical
views on turning in cheaters.
One person said, “I’m a
cheater." Another asked, "Hllw
can you have an honor system
when in social affairs you’re
treated like potential sex
maniacs?”

Dissatisfaction with the pres—
ent proctdring system was listed
by several voters with sugges—
tion that teachers administering
tests proctor more carefully.

Many of the reasons listed
against the system were felt by
the committee to be invalid, re—
flecting little acquainance with
the System as Set up.

Dave Modberry, committee
chairman, estimated that, at
most, 50 per cent of the campus
became familiar with system
through KGRW, open discus—
sions, house meetings, and mim—
eographed copies.
