The need for teachers in ele-t
mentary schools will continue‘
to increase o‘ver the next several:
years. According to a recent
study by the Department of La-
bdr’s Bureau of Labor Statistics,‘
enrollments in grades 1 to s-
will probably rise sharply tor
the next 7 years in most states
and then level off. The total
number of elementary teaching
positions will therefore increase
considerably, perhaps by moreK
than 260,000 in the next seven,
years. The number of new:
teachers required annually with
be greatest about 1953, the year‘
when the sharpest increase in}
enrollments is expectd. i

Many more new teachers
are required each years as
replacements than for new
positions, even in the current
period ot rapid growth oi cle-
mentary school population. 0n
the basis of a conservative
rate of 7 per cent, it is esti ‘
mated that over halt a milei

years to replace those who
die, retire, or leave the class-
rooms for other reasons. hi
addition, a sizcablc number
will be needed to replace
some of 'lhe persons new

The number of young people
