day House to be Wrecked.

Macy house was vacated for
the last time. The home, built
by Professor Macy in the 1890’s
will be wrecked within the
month to make way for Youn-
ker hall, the final addition to
the men’s housing facilities.

Professor Macy’s house was
the scene of important confer-’
ences in its day. The professor,
who established the first cola
lege political science depart»
ment and was an important fig.
ure in international affairs, en-
terfained Lord Bryce there
while he wrote a portion of his
American Commonwealth.

After this semester’s new Stu-I
dents moved out they expressed]
little regret. Bill Omdnthnel
of Macy’s sixteen freshmen,
said, “If we hadn’t moved out
it would have fallen in around

us." Lewis Jacobsen, who had
to change hall affiliations be-
cause of the move, thought it
was for the best. He said that
although everyone enjoyed liv-
ing there, Conditions were con—
siderably better in the halls,
Dave Vinje, ”housemother," bes
lieves that assmilaiion into the
men’s hall systems will acquaint
the former Macy house boys
with campus activity better.
Younker hall foundations will
be dug where Macy now stands
and will complete campus hous-
ing plans. Dr. Stevens said that
optimum housing conditions will
be provided for the 1100 on-
campus Students. All students
with the exception of those who
are married or those who must

’live off campus for economic

reasons, will be expected to live
in the dormitory system.

Job Oppor+uni+ies Scarce,

Duke Tells '50 Gradua+es

”Placement opportunlties for
college graduates will be fewer
this year,” asserts Mi. G..Les-
ter Duke, director of placement.
He explains that fewer repre-
sentativcs of firms will be vis—
iting college and university
campuses this spring.

“This means that more indi-
vidual initiative will be neces—
sary,” he says. His advice to
seniors is to “start early and ex
plcrc all opportunities if you
want a job in June."

Some representatives will be
on the campus in the near fu-
ture. Mr. E. H. Fleer of the
Providence Washington Insurs
ance Company, Providence, R.
1., will be here February 15
and 16. He will conduct a group
interview Wednesday evening,
February 15, at 7:30 p.m. and
individual interviews the next
day.

.290 Letters To Concerns

During December the place-
ment office sent out more than
200 letters to Various business
and industrial concerns. The
office has received many re-
plies to these letters. Some have
been tabulated and are avail-
to seniors. The senior
placement brochures are now
available.

SCARLET AND BLACK

LetTers +0 The
Editor

To the Editor of the Scarlet and
Black:

During the recent convoca-
tion Dr. Stevens spoke of per»
Sonal discipline in regard to)
displays of affection by men and
women on the Gl‘innell cam-i
pus. As Dr. Stevens seems
against such displays in public,
(for example, the women’s log—
gla), and as he, as a psycholo-
gist, knows that one cannot sup-
press such natural tendencies, it
would be fitting for the college
to provide a place, convenient-
1y located, where affection
might be shown without fear
of having the outside world
know that Grinnell students are
normal.

Sincerely,

Art Exhibfion .
By John Sloa

An art exhibition by John
Sloan is being shown in Main
Corridor during the month of

'ident in 1930. He was a news-

zinc and hook illustrations. His
studio is located in New York
City where he points and etches
city life.

He spends four months of the

ous prizes and medals.

Howard, low
iii?

Wallaceite,
U. S. Jim Crow

The Jim Crow policy of this
nation is serving the purposes
of the financial interests, declar-
ed Charles P. Howard in a talk
to a Joint meeting of the Ister—
naliosal Relations Club and the
Students for Democratic Action
last evening. Mr. Howard, a
Negro, was keynoter for the
Progresslve party convention in
shlbe Park, Philadelphia, in
1943. He is one of the leading
lawyers in Iowa.

Foremost in his discussion
was the point that the United
States has made lime or no pic-
gress for the Negro in the last
fifty years. He also stated that
this nation has used its econom-
ic power to maintain the col-
onial subjugation of colored
peoples over the world, in the
hopes of maintaining u finan-
cial supremacy,

in opening his second scmes-
ler membership drive, Dave
Hammer, Presldcnt of IRC,
stated that it would be the con-
tlnuing policy of IRC to bring
noted speakers to the Grinnell
campus. If funds can be found,
he stated, the Hon. Bourke B.
Hickenlooper, S e n a t o r from
Iowa, will be on campus.
