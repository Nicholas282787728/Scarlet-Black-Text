At Hampton all of the stu-

Lillian Robinson said one of
the projects connected with her
sorority was contribution to the
work of the Mississippi Delta

for farmers of that area. There
was a program at Thanksgiving

at which food in the dining

The Student. Committee on
Educational Policies was set up
this week by the Central Com-
mittee of the Student Council.
The new committee grew out of
an idea of Dr. Stevens that the
students should have some say

, in picking the new dean and in
lhe educational policies of the
school. The idea was further
discussed at the Newton leader-
‘ship confcrence. The students
chosen are sophomores Pete Mc-
Aleonan and Barb Betz. juniors
Jane Connell and Les Allen. and
seniors Lce Patton and Myra
Stewart. Myra is chairman of
the Committee.

This committee will work with
the Faculty Committee on Edu-
cational Policies headed by Dean
Strong Myra has met with Dean
Strong to discuss the functions
of the student committee and
now the two committees will
meet separately for the same
purpose. There will be a joint
meeting on February 23.

So far it is definitely known
that the present exam system
‘will he one thing worked on. A
student poll will be taken on
this. The committee has already
met with Dr. Stanley Niles. the
first of prospective deans to visit

students were present at a meet '
ing of prospective pilots Tues-
day to hear President Stevens
speak on the possibility of a
flying program at Grinnell. .

“I am interested in flying.” .
said Dr. Stevens. “I believe that
all young people ought to be.
it is inevitable that eventually“
there will be more flying.”

The basic stumbling block for

pressed the hope that if there
would be an organized demand,
the college might offer a credit.

Dr. Stevens offered the stu—
dents the following plan:

A flying club would be or-
ganized. composed of people

willing to pool their resources
and buy planes with the help of
the college. Othci' students
could then rent planes from the
club while they leain to fly.

Wednesday afternoon. 11 per—
sons who had previously done
some flying. met with President
Stevens. They elected a tempor—
ary steering committee to con—

sider the problems of organiza—
tion, cost of planes, transporta-
tion to and from the flying
ficld, and maintenance of the
planes. The committee consists
of Roger Cameron, Smith fresh-
man. chairman; James Sim-
