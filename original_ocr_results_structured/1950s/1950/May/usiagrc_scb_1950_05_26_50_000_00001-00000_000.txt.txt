Several of them were asked,
by the 5&3 this week what they
would advise next year’s stu-j
dents, seniors in particular, to
do 'n the absence of the Class
of 00.

Beth Weiss says that Hal,‘
though it does seem as if all
those plans drawn up for next

classes for years past have ex-
perienccd this feeling also. Prob-
ably just about this time last
year we were’the object of
doubt of the class of 1949."

Drinking Board
Receives Replies
From Parents

A letter written by the Com—
mittee of girls over 21 to re-
vise the drinking rule was
mailed May 18, to the parents of
all junior and senior girls. A
postca‘l'd was enclosed
serves as a ballot for voting on
the question.

The change recommended is
to allow women of twenty—one
to use their dwn discretion in
drinking off campus.

Suzanne Warner, chairman of
the committee, said it is too
early to predict what the out
come of the vote will be. Nearly
all ballotsreturned so far, pro
and con, have included remarks
from the parents Most of the
remarks showed firmness in cone
viction such as on this Yes vote:
“I would second any proposal
that would develop or enhance
maturity in adultsl Where there
is a healthy character structure,
there should never be a double
standard in any fine liberal col-
lege. One cannot legislate moral-
ity . ,

One of the No votes stated.
“I do not believe the present
policy should be liberalized; if
any change is made the rules
governing the men should be
more stringent to conform to
the women’s. If anyone wishes
looser controls there are many
colleges and universities which
are less strict and the few dry
colleges which remain should be
preserved for the element who
desire such an atmosphere for
learning . .

Several parents mentioned
they weren’t “drinkers” but fav-
ored the rule because of its
principle. Some others disfavor-
ed it, stating that the present
rules on drinking are the reas—
ons for sending their daughters

“To gain benefits in all fields
of College life by the exchange
of information with other col—

principles" three Grinnell repre-
sentatives, Joan Baker, Jim
Morgan, and Duane Blcugh, at.
tended the student government
conference or the Midwest Con-
ference colleges at Cornell last
weekend._

The conference is not an or.
ganization to join, but rather a,
meeting of interested represent-‘
ativcs from the colleges who
will exchange ideas from which,
it is hoped, ”some resolutions
will result in specific areas that
will present the concensus of‘
opinion of all the Midwest cola
lcgcs and therefore be a valu—

able talking point.” The schools
represented are Belcit, Coe,
Cornell, Knox, Lawrence, Mon—
mouth. Ripon, and Grinnell.

The topics taken up at the
Cornell meeting were organize-l
tlon, honor systems, standard;
admission charge for athletic
events, each school charging am!
13- 50 cents for students from,
the dpponent’s school, chapel,
ways in which to encourage ate
tendance; Conference Literary
review, which was not too fave
orably received; conference
baseball; band contracts, the pos.
sibility of securing name bands
through an agent in Cedar Raps
ids; and purposes of a Liberal
Arts college, The latter’s attempt
to set up ”a list of principles
and aims common to all of the
liberal arts colleges present
failed because of lack of knowl-
ledge as to just what students
in these institutions felt their
purpose and aims are." Each
school was requested to get stu-
dents' ideas and present them
at the next meeting at Lawrence
in the early part of December.

Bev Bond believes that next
year’s leaders should aid in the
development of the qualities of
leadership in all students. “To
