vanceil degrees) tor basic and

has been due chieiiy to in-
creased demand brought about
by the backlog or research
projects postponed during the
war, and the increased enroll-
ments in colleges and universi—
ties and the shifting of much‘
basic research to this country
from Europe.

In industrial laboratories,
where chemists represent nearv
ly 40 per cent of the total numr
her or scientists and research
engineers employed. opportunir
ties have been good for those
with advanced degrees or speci-
alized experience.

Chemists with graduate train-
ing, particularly those with doc~
torates, should cdntlnue to have
good prospects in the next few
years. However, the number of

'advanced degrees granted has
been increasing rapidly. In 1948-
49, the number of doctorates
granted in chemistry reached an
alltime high of about 750, well
above the previous high of 672
in 1940-41 and more than in
any other field of study. Rec-
ord numbers of master’s ties
grees have also ‘been awarded.
Graduate enrollments will be
large in the early 1950’s, and the
number of doctorates awarded
should continue high for sev~
era! years.

Employment prospects ior
new entrants holding only the
bachelor‘s degree are less
promising, at least tor the
early 1950’s, owing to the
end oi World War II.
