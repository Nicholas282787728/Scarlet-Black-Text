Classes Are Fun, But There' is a LimitiPr‘omoleCrlme Preveni'lon,
V-“ lSupporf Research. Says Prof

The subiect of classes held

, i
over the hour ts a problem eon—

tinually discussed by the stu-
dents but seldom brought to
the attention of the offending
professors.

Before labelling the offenders
We Keel that it is necessary to

commend those profs wlio arel

attentiverof the time and dis-
miss their classes promptly But
for those consistently unaware
of the time allotted them we
have distinct categcries . . . the
well—meaning enthusiast, the
proverbial absent-minded pm-
.iessor and the talkative egotist.

Least offensive of the three;
lin the eyes of the students is:
l the well-meaning enthusiast who
Iconsciously retains his students
l‘with a sincere intention of giv—
ing them their due. There are
many timcs when a minute or
two more would suffice to wind
up a lecture or to clear up
points of discussion. if it is an
occasional event. the students
do not objec; when they woes
fully await it daily it becomcs
‘another matter. Regardless of
lhow wellsmeaning a prof may
be, he asks for and receives
time not due him.

Kansas Scribe Muses on Editos’s Letters

People are: crazy! lt t’dkCS all
kinds to make a world! How
true, how true, and one of the
best ways we know of finding
out just what kinds of people
it really takes is to read letters
addressed to the edior. We say

this without any fear
tradiction.

There'ate all kinds of letters.
each one representing some un»
known personality hovering in

the background. These shadowy
as

beings cmerge on paper

of cons‘

lbeyond any recognizable form.
ogrcs, angels, beasts and what-
nots. Sclmc twist the language
‘Some clutch at our heartstrings.
Some are iust plain nasty. 0th-
lcr letters are couched in care
lful terms of praise, but, alas,
lthese are too few.

The letter writers seem to
tend to flowery language. In»
,dced, we received several poems
‘cammnting on mercy killing.
lMC‘st of them we could under
stand and chuckle over apprecia—
tively, but one was past any

l
l

comprehension. With a premonr
tion of proxrinity to greatness,
we hurriedly dispatched the

“thing” 'to the English departs
inent. No word has been re-
ceived.

But of all the letters we have
received, the one we cherished
most is one that after discussing
at length and with some erudi—
tion a ticklish subject, ended‘
lwith an abrupt “Go to helll"

l We’re going. (ACP) — Daily
Kansan, University of Kansas.

ceived a grad ate assistantship
at the Universtty of Kentucky
and will work in chemistry tee
ward his Ph.D. '

University of California at
Berkeley.

Marilyn Wales will take a
research assistantship in phar—
macology, Department of phal'el
macology, Washington Unlverri
sity, St. Louis, Mo. Miss Wales‘
replaces Katharine Young, class
of ’48 in this job.

Douglas Takes/l
Iowa UCoaclling;

I Job for ‘50-51

Ben Douglas, '31, whose nine
letters in football, basketball,
and track rank him as one of
Grinnell’s alletime a t h l c t i c
greats, has been named an ass
sistant varsity grid coach at the
State University of Iowa, where
he will handle the punters and
centers.

Douglas, who coached at Gri —
ncll from 1940 to 1942 and re.
turned from the navy in 1946
for a season as head football
coach and two seasons as head
cage coach, has since been head
football coach at Colorado col»!
lege for two seasons and an aSsl
lsistant coach at the Missouril
iSchool of Mines, besides taking

‘a business position for a time. ,

Fankie Laine‘s newest success,
I“Swamp Girl” is the work of a
young man we feel will go far.
The composer is Michael Brown
who has scored a hit in night
club appearances in New York
and, more recently at the swank
Buttery in Chicago.

Brown has written at least
three songs dealing with life
under the sea. “Swamp Girl”
is his “commercial" one. A
psychiatrist once asked him
why he deals so much with
drownings. Mike replied that
sea life fascinated him. “Ev—
erything takes on a‘ new tips
pcarunce under water," he re-
marked. “Things start waving,
and present a very beautiful
appearance."

Micheal Brown has written a
love ballad ”Spring Never
Heard,” which should be making
its appearance soon. This l‘cs
porter thinks it’s good..“Yeah,l:
said Brown, ”It‘s got to make
some money for me."

We aren't. quite sure wheth-
er a baker’s union Has been
paying the song writers or not,
but the country has developed
a sweet tooth this _ spring.
“Sunshine Cake" is a little'
corny, but we like‘it better
by Bing than by Peggy Lee,
but either will do if you like
cake.

Jo Stafford's “Ask Me No
Questions," on a Cap label is a
Cute little number too, but l‘lgl‘lt
about now we feel the need forI
somehing in the way of a more
subtle serious ballad. It‘s been
quite a while since there have
been any real dcvlopmnts in
thcgway of new love songs.

RENT A TANDEM BICYCLE _ “Built for two”
From RITTER’S HARDWARE

A beliver in prevention of
rim and delinquency, Dr. Har—
rison A. Dobbs, professor of
social welfare at Louisiana State
university makes suggestions for
solving thc delinquency probe
lein:

“We should promote and sup
port more meaningful research
and toster education for greater
emotional maturity. Successful
family living for more children
should be encouraged and symp
toms of unacceptabel bchavior
should be dealt ivith early. Lasts
ly our social pattern shduld
place increased i-csponsibility on
ithe citizen for delinquent be-
llaVlol‘.”

He illustrates his belief
prevention with an allegory.

“The citizens in a town located
on a high bluff took action to
keep people from falling over
the precipice. First, they at.
tempted to establish adequate
ambulance service at the bot
tom. Next they built a fence at
the top. Both attemps were un-
successful. A town meeting was
called and a decision made to
educate the young and old to
stay away Irom‘the dangerous
edge. It was also decided to
.present the townsfolk with,
means of using up their excess
energy. This was a successful
,and lasting solution,"
