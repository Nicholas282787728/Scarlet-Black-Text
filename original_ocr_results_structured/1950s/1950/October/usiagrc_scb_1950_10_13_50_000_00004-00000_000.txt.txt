Poking a Journalistic digit intol

commenced wrth a growl. Not;

question with a wink of an eye
or a flip ot an car. We deducei
the tollowing from these winks
and flips.

Prefers Chippendale

Chocolate thinks the furniture

matter,, tine, Opining ireely, he
said, “I‘m an old Chippendale
man myselt. I know terriers go
for Sheraton, but that’s what
makes horse races, or,is it clog
races?"

Being of German ancestry, he
teels that lowa beer laws as in—
terpreted by Grinnell are not
what they were in Hiedclberg.
However, food here seems prets
ty good this year and makes up‘
for the loss of some of his close
Irlends.

Freudian Views

Atter a toothy yawn, Cllocos
late continued that the open
house situation didn‘t bother
him since he holds quite pro-
gressive view on Freud. Our
than thought it best to move on
to other topics.

Whenoueried on the inter-
national situation, Chocolate
winked, “l have been keeping
both eyes peeled for any suba
versive elements that might slip;
under the teat or our congress-l
men. 1 have been caretul to
avoid any fellow travelers in the
political woods." _

Lowdnwn Superiority

"I like it here at Grinnell and
mix with all kinds,” the kindly
Dachshund 'said. I teel that I!
have a certain superiority over

The trusty 5&8 tool halted}
these capers by tweaking the:
doggish tail around one of Mn}
Jackson’s lamps. with a cry of
pain and resignation, Chocolate:
signitied that the conference wasl
over and slid under the neigh-‘
boring rug.

one 01 his riery speeches, “We
have overcome rcsistanoc to
communism in Russia and
shall go on winning through-
out the world. If we need to ,
lie, murder, and double cross
to gain this end we shall not
hesitate."
“This is the. basic philosophyl
the communist leaders in:
Russia,” said Dunnington. “This
has ruined the personalities of
these people. I love the Russian
people but have nothing good
to say about their leaders. Pcra
sonality is the supreme value
in the universe," ho exclaimed,
Dunnington said that the
Kremlin believes its own lies
now. The reason tor so many
purges in Russia is that therei
is so little trust among the
leaders A system so inherent-
Iy evil cannot help tailing, he;
stated. l
Dunnington explained that
Russia is willing to strive to
ward obtaining her objective
the easy way. This easy way is,
for her to form many satellite
betore the UN. does
anything about it. l
“\Ne must, and we will have i
a low years to see that com»
munism Won‘t work," said
Dunnington. He said that the
UN. is planni g to have com-
missions in cvo’ry trouble spot
throughout the warld. Also,
the UN. is planning to have
iorccs ready to be flown to
any place where there is ag—
gression, ,
“There will be trouble ahead,”
Dunnington concluded. “It will
be up to the youth of today to
come through the cold war and‘
the war of nerves on top.” He
said emphatically, “I’m more
hopetul now, however, that we
can avoid World War Three
