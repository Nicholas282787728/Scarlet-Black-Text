> It would probably be best for all if the Christmas spirit
m chal ty could be a guiding motivation at all seasons of
the ye; but beil * merely mortal, ours has already worll a.
little thin. The tact of the matter is we’re as mad as all
get out,

The whole thing stalted a few nights ago when, after.
ra severe drubbing at Canasta, ue tuned in tlle late even-
ing sports news as reported by WMT’s Tait Cummins in an
attempt to catch up on things and soothe our ruffled temp—
We caught up on things okay, bilt tllat was alll

After giving out the distre . iig' news that the Univer—
of Iona had received a thorough knocking about iii its
conference opener, a run down on local scores and a iiumbcri
of other items of lesser importance, Mix Cummins got to the

bject of the s \' \ ike Forest football players that Wel'el
'u sciplined for ch' ting on an exam. Three were given the
boot; three were pill on probation, thereby being automat—
i llly disqualified from any further participation in athlet—
ics according to college regulations.

sit'

This untidy bit of news evidently aroused Mr. Cum-i
l s considerably for quite suddenly his voice, which ordie,I

y sounds like its owner says lying down, leaped into}
high gear with a spirited if somewhat incoherent editoriall
on discipline, ethics and education.

l

Bill: what really got us ilp in the air were his unusual
ideas about discipline. Discipline, he said, was the most
important thing for young people to learn because we must
“-"ollow the rules" in life as on the playing field. HOVl'e\’€l',l
continued this rustic journalist, its just too bad that the‘
disciplinary action taken at Wake Forest was the work of
their student council!

In a further expansion of this theme that was so shot
through with contradictions as to defy accurate recording
here, this homespun milscleenews hawker Cummins, said
that he thought student governments were just dandy so
long as they stick to student governing. But to cast the
fates of six young athletes into their liandsl Heaven forbid
and perish the thought!

For Mr. Cummins such a serious problem is no job for
a student council. According to hiln, such a group is too
small, to unrepresentative, and obviously too immature to
1 ndle such matters. How more representative, Tait? A
general election by the student body? Or how more mature?
By the collective might, intelligence and intuition of the
president of the college “.7

Mr. Cummins obviously has never had any association
» initli a student council or he would surely know that to strip
a student governing body of its disciplinary powers is to re-
d ch it to the status of sort oi’highrbrow debate club.
Discipline, says the Cedar Rapids education expert, is
great thing, most necessary for adjustment to society,
but by, George, young men and women in college are just
too young and lack the sag’acity to pass judgment on their
fellow students.

3

To wind up this soliloquy in drivel, Mr. Cummins
launched into the old saw about tempering justice with
1 cy but gave it a most unusual emphasis, After all, says
Tait, you pay for an education, pay for the priv ege of play-
ing football, and you should get something for your money.
Now this traditional capitalist flim-flam is okay, but can
>2‘irlybody in his right mind apply it all the way when it
comes to a college education?

What Mr. Cummins was obviously implying was that
a college hasn’t any right to give the heave-ho to a student
‘vt‘llOSe account is all straight in the treasurer‘s office!

MruCummins, for shame. Stick in there with that
5,)oi‘tS stuff, old man, that's your racket. But don’t you
think that we should all follow that ancient proverb which
~ says if you don't know what you're talking about, Shut Up?

With Deep A precial‘ion . . .

Enlightenment is a w derful thing. A liberal, unrfet—
lured and openrlniuded insight is even better. President
, ens has demonstrated to us a sampling of the latter
x lich is not only “good copy” but is also a forward step of
,lajor significance.

_ In June of this ,year Mr. Earl D. Strong will retire as

Dean of the College after it lifetime of service to Grinnell.
:As might well be suspected, retirement for Dean Strong will
knot consist of a ville covered retreat in Pasadena. Dean
,Slrolig is scheduled to [rave] to Europe, there to continue
his long career as a student of international economics.

But his position must be filled on the Grinllell admin-

ltive stal'i'. Dr. Stevens has recently released the news
that the students of Grinnell will have a say in choosing
the new dean, That is, a student committee will be form-
oTl of representative members which will be party to all
:lrlministl tive deliberation on candidates for the job of
Dean of the College.

Of course the final decision will rest in the hands of
Dr. Stevens, but we believe that the consideration of slur
Liciit opinion in this matter is a forward looking move and
that the students chosen for the cominitlee should feel ex-

iin Miss Erockman’s opinion,

 

-treinely proud of the very difficult task to which they will
ire asked to devote their energies Selection of such a com-
mittee would seem to be an indication of an unusually high
iegard for the maturity of the student body at large. We
appreciate that recognition.
