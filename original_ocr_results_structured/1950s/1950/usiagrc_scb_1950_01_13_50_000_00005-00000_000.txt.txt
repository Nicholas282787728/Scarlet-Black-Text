Tiny pieces of metal so‘
ﬂushing back and forth, Clings:
'ing now to this breast, now
to that. People whisper, others:
cry. The glittering metal con-l
tinues, sometimes challengch
sometimes unchallenged in its‘
course.

What’s it all
symbol of love, hope, despair,
the hall pin. Cherished byi
many. yearned for by others,
the hall pins of Grinnell have,
been sadly neglected in onc‘
respect, and that is that few
know the stories behind the
pins themselves.

One of the most familiar pins
is the Rawson llorsc surrounded
by his horseshoe of seed pearls
which perpetuates the tradition
of the Kelly Stables, it seems
that back in the late twenties,
speakeasy days, some or the=
,Chicago members oi what was:
then merely “building 3” did a;
little getting together during‘
Christmas vacation at a place inl
Chicago known as the Kellyi’
Staples. 'Upon their return
“building 3" jokingly became
known as the Kelly Stables.
That spring they conceived the
idea or producing a variety
show, "The Kelly Review,” {or
which the administration retuscd
the use of any of the college
buildings. The undauntcd men
produced the show on a stagei
which they erected on the loggia‘
and into the hall lounge. The
reaction of theedministration
in this instance was to request
a formal apology in chapel
which turned into a farce.

In the words ot the Rawson
house president, charlie Harpole,
the results to all this was that
upon “being persecuted by the
administration and ot being con.
gratulated by the student body,
the Kelly men. became more
thanever determined that their
newly-acquired notoriety and the
name that inspired the cause for
it should not soon be forgotten."
To perpetuate the name, they
designated a plaque which con.
-tained ll'lr \ orcl and form the
- theme' onf « Kelly 'Stables.” It
was from this plaque (the where-
abouts of which is not at present
known to the hall) that‘the pin
was derived. ' ‘ '

.The Gates men are not very
illuminating upon the subject of
their pin. They know that theirs
is one whose symbol probably
originated in the latter part.ot
the 30’s. But that’s about all,

over two torches of learning.

livesslded plate of gold.

in the Clark pin along with three
