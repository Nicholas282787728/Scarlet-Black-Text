5 ltear Trial

About the system Ann Still—
man said, “This isn’t a pure
honor system; it has an honor
court for violators We hope that
eventually there will be no need
for the court. It is included in
the honor system plan to help
establish the system. That's why
the plan states that the whole
honor sysem should be accepted
on a 5-year trial basis; it’s im-
possible to build up an honor
system in a year’s time.”
