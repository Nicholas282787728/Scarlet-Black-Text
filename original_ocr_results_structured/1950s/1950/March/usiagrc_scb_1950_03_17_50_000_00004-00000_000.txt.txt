Gridders Develop Plans lor 5O

 

By Dick Clark

Spring football practice got
underway Wednesday as 37 men
drew uniforms and started the
early season workout. {We are
chiefly interested in seeing who
can do what, and giving the
buys a taste of our ,system of
play,” said coach Hank Brown,
starting his second year as head
grid man.

Last season Brown’s charges
had the most successful cam—
paign since the war, winning
five and losing three. “We plan
to Stick to the Trfarmation we
used last year," Brown coma
merited, “But we are going to
experiment with a different
type of platoon System."

The Pioneer coach used sep»
erate squads on offense and de—
fense last year, but Brown
would like to try two squads,
playing each team on both off—
ense and defense. This new sys—
tem might be better than the
one used last year, because in
1949 a new team entered the
game every time the hall
changed hands. often a player
would not he warmed up hefore
he was back on the bench. By
using a team on both offense
and defense, the unit in action
could play long enough to
settle down,

Brown, however, stresses that
the spring innovations are mere.
1y experiments, and the style
of play will have to be molded
to the material available.

, Out for football this year are:
Fred Peterson, Charles Stryker,
Paul Sanderson, Eugene Parker,
David Van Horssen, Charles
Mathis. Jim Morgan, Bill 0m-
danl, Clarence Barlow, Keprord
