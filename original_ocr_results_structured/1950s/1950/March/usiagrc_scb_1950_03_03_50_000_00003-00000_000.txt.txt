Beer For Success: From

New, Autho ri

tative Report

 

By Essenby

The 5&3 Alcoholic Bevel‘agei
committee. like the committees
of Lite and other publications,,
has, through an exhaustive;
(urp) investigation, come up:
with a rep rt concerning the
tuture of the drinkers of various
alcoholic beverages. The report:

The desire to drink the juices
or wild herbs and other rare
roots concludes that you willl
sell vacuum cleaners, or pets
and pans for a fast dying cor-
poration. ‘

A craving for champagne in-i
dicates that you will wmd up‘
as a publicity agent for a smalll
players’ stock company,

Whiskey drinkers fall
two categories. If you like it
straight (or dropped into a
glass oi beer) you are irrevo-
cably headed i'or the higher
stratum of the military service,
finishing your career with at
least three stars hanging from
your uniform. On the other
hand, if you mix it With water,
ginger, or soda you are doomed
either to the life of a lifeguard
at a notetooepopular beach, or
the life of a clerk in a notstoos
successful corporation.

If you like wine. you are
most likely to become a college
proicssor, have many children,
and die with a pile of blue
books on your chest (and a
bottle of wine in your hand).,

But, it beer is your speed,‘
statistics prove that you Willi
undoubtedly become an inter—i
nationally prominent iigure,
perhaps inventing the P bomb.
or something of similar im.
portance, "
