C of HP Agrees to Damage Charge and Fine Policy

Repair charges agnd fines for
willful student damage on north
campus will be assessed separ-
ately in the future according to
a new plan adopted by the
Council of House Presidents,
Dean of Men Henly Brown,
and buildings and grounds Su-
perintendent Norman Marble
this week

Meeting yesterday noon, the
group decided details of the
new procedure, which will re.
place the plan instituted about
ten years ago. The old plan pro-
vided that college ofﬁcials
assess a combined charge for late
bor, materials, and a fine when
willful damage occurred, ac-
cording to Dean Brown, who
said he has conferred with
Treasurer Rupert Hawk and
President Samuel N. Stevens.
The fine was originally set at
50 percent of the repair costs,
Brown stated.

The new plan will openate as
follows. The building and
grounds department will send a
detailed itemization of labor and
material costs for each dermis

tory repair job that the depart

necessitated by malicious acts.

This will consist of an item—.
ized repair hill and a copy of
the specific work order, whicht
will be sent to Dean Brown and
then to the c of HP. The c of
HP will decide if the damage
was done willfully and who is
responsible for the damage If1
it decides that the damage was
willful it will bill the person or
persons involved for the amount
of the repair costs and in acidic
hion will assess a fine that they
set. Fines will be paid to the‘
c of HP treasury.

If the council finds that thet
damage was not willful, the bill
will be sent back to the Dean
of Men and then to the build-
ings and grounds department:
which will pay for the damages
out of maintenance funds.

Dean Brown stressed the fact
that, while he is happy with the
new plan, it will be revoked if
it breaks down in any way.

Superintendent Marble said
that in the past room damage
charges may have been invade

previously paid for. He stressed
that this was not. intentional
and that every-thing will be
done to avoid such difficulties
in the future.

The group also went on rec.
ord as favoring a change in as-
sessing room damages at the
end or the school year. They
recommend that :31] Such
charges that exceed two dollars
will be itemized whEn the treas-
ul'el"s office assesses them. It
was also agreed that better un-
derstanding of room damage
