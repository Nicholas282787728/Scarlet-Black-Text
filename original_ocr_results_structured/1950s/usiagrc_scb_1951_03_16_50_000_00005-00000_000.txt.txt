Grin nell ‘Heiress"

Last night saw
~pcrloi~mance of
college theater’s
“The Heiress," The play, sug-
gested by the Henry James
novel, "Washlngton Square," was
produced and dirccicd by Mr
Kent Andrews.

The entire action or the show
takes place in the lavish New
vYol‘k home of Dr. Sloper. A
=suerb setting was d‘esigned by
George Goughnour and Julian
Halverson, both students in Mr.
Andrews’ scene design class.
Among the central ﬁgures is
Catherine Sloper, the heiress
herself, beautiiully portrayed by
Ann Good. Roger Perry does
admirably as Morris Townsend,
ttlie young mercenary who seeks
to marry the heiress for her
money.
‘ A newcomer to the Grinnell
stage, Suzi MacClusky, is ,most
smooth and convincing as La
vima Penniman. Miss MacClusky
proves herself a true asset and
one of the brightest spots in the
show. Paul Nay, another new—
comer, slightly
,part or Dr. Sloper but at times
.shows promise or real acting
ability. Miss Dorothy Hume
turned in her usual splendid
pertormance as the doctor’s sis-
ter.

The minor parts are sparked
by Paula King and James Leav-
enworth, both veterans of the

All In all “The Heiress" ranks
ninong the best of the shows

any weakness is to be found, it
lies in the two hour and forty
