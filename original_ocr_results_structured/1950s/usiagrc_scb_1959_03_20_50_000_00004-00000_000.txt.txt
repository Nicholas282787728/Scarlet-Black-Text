and greatly varying backgrounds
of experience and lamily
standards. The college's mini-
mum standards ioi- behavior
must apply equally to all. the
just and the unjust alike: there
is no other practical, enforceable
way.

The college is not operating a
Greenwich Village.

The basic question. it seems
to me, is to what
Oberlin college should be ex-
pected to exert parental anth-
ority over the students while
they are here. 0 'ously, the
primary responsi ty ol the
icollege is to provide the best
possible academic lacilities,
top quality teachers, students.
libraries, laboratories, etc. But
there is no question but what
the parents of most students
and the public, including gen-
CI‘DIIS donors who “pay the
piper" to keep the college g0-

il’lg, expect of it some degree .

of paternalistic responsibility
tor the non-academic lite of
students away Trout home.

Students naturally rebel at
paternal restraints here, just as
they do at home. it is of the
very nature of any healthy,
modern American from age 13
to "1, that he or she is rebcle
lious, iconoclastic, proud of new
“maturity" and defensive con.
cerning it, restless, cccksure—
and yet so unsure inqui
probing, experimenting, anxious,
contentious.

Couples do of course need
and deserve an opportunity to
Commune with each other in
reasonable privacy, During bad
weather the Oberlin campus
‘certainly lacks Sufficient such
opportunities for pi‘lVaCy. ll. can

not be ignored that when tlley‘

are home most students have
the use of family cars, family
parlors and porches for dating
purposes; whereas here, cars are
lot-hidden to them and there

are too low parlors and porc'hes.‘

The “privacy" problem tor
students is thus very real,
even though it does seem that

,the current generation on
campus may be overly lrautic
about it. Perhaps getting nois—
ily lrontic is the only way to
get results,

The college deﬁnitely should
move to pravide better social
opportunities and privacy. But,
just as at home when the fame
ily wants to buy another car,

, build a porch or extra room, it
may require money which is
'lacking or for which there are

more important needs. And it,

too.

Meanwhile, obcrlin students
of today, like their predecessors,
will just have to use their in—
genuity. 1 'Suspect most ‘bf the
really hcuvy datcrs are not
among those most loudly coin-

takcs time,

plainlng, lull that some of that
noisicst com'plciners do so for‘

the vicarious sex experience

they thus attain.

one ol,0berliu‘s aims, to de-
: volop the studellts’ “social l'er

l having to “make (1-0” with
‘ very limited means and op~
portunitics. Is that the secret
or college policy on this mat»
; to)?

l

The college is for less pater-
nal today than in earlier days.
There has been a steady evolu—
tion in the degree or freedom
allowed to each student genera-
tion. It does not seem to me
jthat this evolution '
,‘has logged .much behind the der
volopmg mores of society in

general.

Of course, in theory, the. col-
lege could renounce all respon-
sibility for the social and pri
,vate behavior of its students.
‘but that is not likely to happen
in the near future, If it did
happen, the college would be
obligated to give lair notice of
thé change in policy, and well
in advance, to the parents of
students and to the public. As
its, most pcoplc to whom the
college is responsible expect it,
to be reasonably patcrnuhstre.
(Some students argue that it is.
they as a special group to!
whom the college is primarily
responsible, But that is a fella—l
cious argument. it is to the coir
tinuing community and society
as a whole, of which each batch
of students is only a part, that
the college is responsible.)

It seems to me the college
should insist that its students
observe standards of social be»
havior which are not too for
i astray from the standards
generally considered accept-
able and proper by the society
, into which the students will
i soon he graduated. in tact,
, that is perhaps a valu—

able part oi the educational
process, A student may ques-
tion the college's rules, argue
t and disagree, but there should

come a point when neverthe-
less he should be required to .
l abide by them. It is a priv-

l ilege to be an‘Dberlin student,
not n right; the student is
here by selection and sorter-
once.

 

Every responsible parent owes
it to his child, even a child of!
17 or 20, to lay down a [ewi
basic, well understood and \vclli
founded principles and rules of
conduct for that child. and to
enforce those rules reasonably,
fairly. and with true allection.

true of a college in dealing with'

regulations are well considercdl
and well deﬁned, they shouldl
then be administcrcd with fai

ness and undcistanding, but nev—

Thcrc is not the slightest reason,
for college authorities to be
timid, tearful, procrastinating oi
equivocal in dealing with stu—‘
dents. A substantial dcgrce of
reasoned discipline, of ﬁrm-
reined regulation, is sound edu-
cational policy.

Each group of students willE
always review and revolutionize
its own “self»govei'nlncl‘il" ma-t
chincry, of course. That is a‘
never ending process. And each
new group will dcscrve the op-
partunitgd to rerdiscuss and al‘gnel
gue with the faculty concerning
the rules. College oilicials and,
faculty owe it to each ndwi
group or students to listen to‘
their advice, to consider and ac-
cept it where it is sound, and
to in turn clearly roux-plain the‘
college's established policies . .
to listen and explain patiently,‘
over and over again. But in the
loud, the college is boss and its
idecisions should be clearly stats

ed and ﬁnal, and ﬁrmly admins
