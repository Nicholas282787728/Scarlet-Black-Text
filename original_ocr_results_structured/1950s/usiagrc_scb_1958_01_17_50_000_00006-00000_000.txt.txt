Dave DeLong hit a 25-ft. set
shot with four seconds to play
to give Grinnell 3 5957 victory

night.

The Pioneers tied the game
with less than two minutes
left to play after coming from
at halftime deﬁcit of 37-27. ne-
Long then forced a St. our
player to kick the bail out of
bounds and the Pioneers eon-
trolled the ball until DeLong
connected with his winning
shot.

Warren Peterson put on a one—
man show for the opposition,
collecting 24 points on 12 field
goals. John Copeland and George
Mchmsey were high for the
Pioneers with 15 and 14 points
respectively.

Both teams hit well over 40
per cent of their shots from the
field.
