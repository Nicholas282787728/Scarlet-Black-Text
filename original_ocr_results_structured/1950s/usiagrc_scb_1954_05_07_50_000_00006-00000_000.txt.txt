To the editor:

This week we, the initiates oi
Honor G, would like to make a
few comments on the purpose
and tactics displayed by Ed
Laing in his column, “Promin
ent Among the Mourners,” Week
after week from his mourners
bench he has attacked and dis-
mantled many practices and peo-
ple of this college. Prepping, the
Y Buddies system, .and the
building and grounds depart-
ment have been subject. , .and
it was to be expected that
eventually Honor G
would fall victim.

.Being initiates ourselves,
we feel that we have a right in
saying that the manner in which
the initation was carried on was
not degrading, shameful,or as he
said—pretentious. He seems to
think that a person has no self-
respect when he agrees to go
through the initiation and that it
takes more guts to refine to
join than it does to join.

. . .A column such as “Prom
inent Among the Mourners" is
not undesirable, but become un-
desirable when the point of view
of the writer is narrow and iso~
lated. Let us assure you that
there have, ot yet, been no per-

‘To the editor:

, The Social Co-ordinating comv
imittee of Grime“ College is
ilooking for solutions to solve the
dating problem at Grinnell Col-
lege. :nhcy stated that there
isn’t enough dating done on this
campus. We
they are correct
this.

Because they are ‘busy thlnk-
ing of new and different ways
of alleviating the dating prob-
lems at Grinnell, as it stands
.now, they should not forget the
prolems at hand.

Saturday evening, those who
did date, other than Ihouse
parties, were, so to Speak, leit
out in ﬁne cold after attending
the movies or what have you.

The least they can do is to
have some place for the couples
to dance or play cards. This is
a situation that should not have
been allowed to happen and
Should be alleviated before
happens again.

Thank you

Last week’s editorial enplain»
irig Arena’s financial plight
prompts this letteri‘ Arena’s
problems might be solved by
placing it on the sem tee, but

GOOD

AND

 

sincerely believe i
in assuming i

it

unfortunately this problem will»

not be aired, At present there is
no definite set of principles de-
fining a policy concerning the
isem fee.

In the case of Uhe Cyclone,
this past year a significant pol“
tion of the cost was paid by
students through the sem fee,
iStudents were not bothered with
Ja $5.00 charge that would have
icome up at a time when tuition
and book costs had to be, met.
Since almost the entire student
body buys an annual, it wastes
‘itime to go out and sell the book.
Many unnecessary hours are
spent on the part of the busi—
ness staff, most of the time
learning from the hall salesmen.

Unfortunately, next year we
will have to return to the $5.00
fee at the beginning of the year.
This means the staff won’t be
liable to make plans until late in
who fall because it will not know
ithe amount of funds available.

' When the sern fee was snarled
the chairman of the Student 01'»
ganizatiolu committee asked the
Central committee of the Stud-

vestigation. The Central commit-
tee polled' organizations by
questionnaires. To this date no
,re-evaluation has occurred.‘ We
ifeel that a definite stand must
lbe taken on this problem, After
all, if the sem fee should be
utilizedl only by those groups
that need financial assistance,

it would seem that athletics
could sell tickets and the S&B
sell subscriptions. However, if
the sen. fee is set up to handle
activities from which all students
might benefit, so that the stud-
lent body gets the greatest rec
‘turn for their investment, we
can understand why the 5&5
and‘ athletics feel they should
be included in the sem fee since
there are far from obscure
