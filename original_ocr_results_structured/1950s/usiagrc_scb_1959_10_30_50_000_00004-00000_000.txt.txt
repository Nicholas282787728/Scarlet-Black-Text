Fisher Sees Bandaranike Death

As Tragic, Shorkinggtl

hy Allan 11. Fisher

COLOMBO, CEYLON _ The
immediate reactions to the death
ot Ccyion Prime Minister S. w.
Pt. D. Bandaranaikc are just as
interesting as the current l'eacs
tions.

“’5‘ “"1 °‘ ”‘9 ““cmp‘cd italkcd reel that it the assassinl

nssassination arrived in the
headline or o. special edition
or the Ceylon Observer, which
read: ”Prime Minister and
Minister Shot." ,

.At that time according to the‘
paper, the wounds to Bandaranarv
ike were only two and not too,
serious, The reeling among the
students was that he would sur-‘
vive this. as he had so many
other so-called political deaths.
No sign of shock among stur
dents was present, They com-
mented that this was the iii-st,
time in Ceylon's history that
such an incident had taken place,
and considered it strange that
the assassin had been a B dd-
hist monk, They w surp d
that the Prune Minister had
not been shot before this, espec-
ially during the communal dis-
turbances in 1953.

When the Governor-General
of Ceylon made a speech to
the nation at 12:30 ii.m.. he
declared a state or emergency
on the advice or the wound-
ed Prime Minister, with whom
he had spoken herorc Banda-
i-unaike was wheeled into the
the oper ting theatre. The
Prime Mi ister had appealed
ror calm and patience among
the people or Ceylon and had
asked them not to show ven-

As an issue. this has other
iacets than those presented
last week, and rd like to
elaborate on them somewhat
before we all decide either
that Crinneii is right or that
it it isn't, it doesn’t matter
particularly.

policy. Ono rll save for next
week.
The ﬁrst I heard irom
Grinncll student: granted that
this is a matter or principle,
shouldn't the college let each
individual student decide for
himseli whcther taking a pro
loyalty oath or signing an anti
suhi-crsivc adidavit errands his
own principles? Are not the
faculty and trustees dictating
ideas that we must live bym
ideas that are (or should be) by
nature, in the province of per-
sonal conscience? ,
For the libcrai (or the First
Amendment variety),
not the same protest urisc
against college policy (though
it agrees with his own choice,
wcro he allowed to choose) as
against government policy?

This seems to me to lie the
liberal‘s argument: I am tic.

cision upon myselt. ,l inn not
allowed in confront the issue
directly, with my own CHIP
science involved in it. I want
my own ideology and my own
integrity to be challenged. I
do not want an enlightened
paternalism to interpose it-
scli hctween mc anti the is.
sue, and that is what Grin-
ncii has done.

i have my own alternative to
but i do not

lreIusC to dismiss a pcrtcctly

thought that he had not sur—l

the public would not be told or

needed time to organize “emer—

disorders

But this deception was not
needed, The Prime Minister
survived the night, and hope
was high tor his recovery

suddenly died. There was no
postmortem pertormed to de-
termine cause or death, a inct
which may have political im—

cause or death may have been
his weak heart or a blood
clot; in this case the assassin
could be charged only with
