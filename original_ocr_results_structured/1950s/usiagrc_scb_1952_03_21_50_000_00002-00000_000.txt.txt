Tu in That Fancy

In commemoration of March 21, the official arrival of
Spring, that day on which a young man’s fancy turns, the
3&3 announces the F‘ st Annual Men’s Week.

This new and original plan is the result of long hours
of discussion and deliberation by the editorial board of
the 5&8. We base our program on the premise that young
men should call up young ladies for dates. It is ollr sincere
hope that all students on north campus will enter into the
true spirit of this Worthy activity. Only by cooperation can
the program have its full measure of success.

In a very real sense, this program can bring new life

to theimen and women of Grinnell. It can instill in them
new hopes, new desires, new aspirations. It can bring relief
to the winter-wearied student.
_. The apathy, the diffidence, the general low state of
morale of the Grinllell student proves that there is great
need for the revitalization that this new social program
can provide. So, it is with deep sincerity that the editorial
board of the S&B launches this program of refinement,
refreshment, and relaxation,

by Nancy McGl‘egor

All the fun of a circus, from
the trained seals to a Canscan
Show, was to be had at Three

nual swim show which was pre-
sented Wednesday and Thursday
nights, and will be presented for
the final time tonight at 8 pm.
in the pool.

The theme wasp combination
circus-carnival with Jim Floss
acting as barker. He led the au-
dlence nrounn lhc midway and
into the big top for lhc 12 nums
bers. each representing n phase
of circus llfc.

The opening number was a
parade, made more impressive
through the use of lights taped
on the girls. An inn-loam trz»
pezc act was done by members
of the club who were black and
red soils and demonstrated in
the, water what circus aerialists
do under the big top.

”Imported" Egyptian dancers
doing a routine direct lrom the
lzmd of sullans and harems cre-
ated an aura of myslcry in their
“native rlrcss." Down the mid-
way from the Egyptian dancers
a snake charmer charmed three
snakes in the water to the music
of "Song of India.” A voodoo
number inspired by music from
the jungles of‘Borneo was done

by Sally Rodgers, Main senior,
and Nadine Andrews, James
sophomore

No circus is coinploie without
its can-can line, and this was no
exception. Eight members of
the club formed a swimming
chorus line doing the can-can. 1

An interlude in the Excitement
of tho show was created by Don-
na Johnson and Beth Lund,
Mcars freshmcnnwho dressed inl
light and dark suits lo symbolizel
night and day. They swam to
Colo Porter’s “Night and Days"

For kids of all ages there was
a merryrgo-round 1n the water,
complric with horses of all cols
ors, and o ferris wheel. Even;
the animals were at the Threel
Ring Swing, with Pat Bartell,
Cleveland senior, and Barb Pct
ran, Read scnior, performing
smoothly as the seals they repel
resented.

The show was excellent and
showed the extensive practice
the girls put into it. In charge
of decorations for the show was
Jan Peterson. Loose hall junior.

Officers of the club are Barb:
Petran, president; Evelynne Hanrl
son, Loose hall sophomore, vice
president; and Gretchen DeGroot,
James sophomore, secretaryr
treasurer. Faculty sponsor is
Phyllis Cunningham (physical
