lhinclads Face Carls Tomorrow
After Midweek Defeat lo ISTC

For the Grinnell college cross—
country squad, this will be a
decisive weekend. Facing the
Carleton college squad, unoffir
cially the strongest in the Mid-
west conference, the Pioneers,
with a record of three confer.
ence wins in three meets, will
attempt to dethrone the Carle—
ton Carls, as a preliminary to
the Midwest conference meet in
Chicago on Nov. l7.

The Carleton squad will rely
chiefly on Wilbur Olson, win—
ner of the conference meet last
year, and Earl Neil who took
third place on the same occar
sion. Led by these veterans, the
Carls defeated a strong St. Olaf
team on its home course, less
than two weeks after the Pier
neers achieved this distinction.
In addition to its veterans, the
Carleton squad contains rive
more members of considerable
ability, among whom is Marty
Baker, winner of the 1956 Mid.
west conference mileel'un. Con.
fident of its ability, the Carls
squad realizes that the outcome
of this meet will quite prob-
ably be an indication of the re-
sult of the Midwest conference
meet in Chicago.

The Grinnell team, now re-
covering from various injuries
which depleted the squad over
the last two weeks, received a
setback as recently as Wednes-
day, when it suffered its first

defeat to the tune of 2648 by
lowa State Teachers college, a
nonrMidwest conference oppon—
ent. in three previous dual
meets, the pioneers defeated St.
Olaf, Lawrence, and last week-
end, Ripon, and seemed set to
repeat last year’s undefeated
record as Midwest conference
champions until this recent de-
feat by ISTC.

The squad comprised of Cap-
tain Larry Schaleger, John Wel-
den, Noel Bacchus, Chuck Yoak,
Bob Downs, Fred Boughey, Bill
Elliot and G. Richter, interviewa
ed at practice on Thursday aft—
ernoon seemed however to re-
guard its defeat by ISTC more
as an incentive to improve per-
formances rather than a perma—
nent setback,

Commenting on the implicar
tions of the meet, Coach lrv Si-
mone remarked that this will
probably be a very important
meet in determining Grinnell’s
chances for a conference victory.

“If my boys defeat Carleton
or even give them a close run,"
he said, ”it will mean that their
confidence will be greatly en—
hanced and that between now
and the conference meet, all our
energy will be devoted to
achieving that fine peak of con—
ditlon necessary for obtaining a
conference Championship."

Harriers Defeated
In Cross Country

Grinnell‘s Pioneer cross-coun-
try squad ran its winning streak
to four before losing its first
meet to Iowa Teachers last
Wednesday.

The Teachers meet, held over
the ZArmile CedarRapids course,
was lost by only two points,
zen—23%. Last Saturday at
Ripon the Redmen proved easy
prey, falling 23.33.

Teachers ace Darrell Conway
won easily in 12' 11”. Grin-
nell captain Larry Schaleger
was second followed by Craw-
ford of Teachers.

Grinnellian Chuck Yoak was
fourth and only a step behind
was teammate John Walden and
a Teachers runner. A tie for
fifth was given to the Teachers
runner although in the opinion
of most observers, Welden beat
him by a safe margin.

Other Grinnell finishers were
Noel Bacchus and Bob Downs,
eighth and ninth respectively.
Fred Boughey, Grinnell's sixth
man, sprained an ankle in a fall

Closing Minutes

The winning marker came
with less than three minutes
left to play as Grinnell lost a
fumble on its own 29. Smith
and quarterback Russ Roebex
doggedly pushed out ground
yardage to the 1 yard line. The
Crinnell line dug in at this
point, held strongly, and it took
three plays before Roeber fin.
ally crashed over the goal line
by inches. Ruecker added his
third placement, making the
score 21-14.

The Pioneers were not yet
beaten, though; not with 2:50
left to play. Shaffer returned
the kick—off 23 yards, evading
three tacklers, before being
brought down. Scotty Walker
picked up 19 yards on a broken.
field run and Shaffer tore away
for another 23 yards, moving
the ball toRipon‘s 33, before the
gun sounded as Grinnell gath-

rolling.

It will be Parean’ day; a
crowd of 1,500 is expected to be
on hand; and our varsity will
be out to snap a three-game
losing streak.

And if last week’s game at
Ripon is any indication of Pio-
neer improvement, the Knights
might well-find themselves re—
turning to Northfield as losers.

Fighting to get out of the
basement, Peterson and Come
pany appear ready to take on
the Minnesotans. Quarterbacks
Steve Bauserman and Jim Bur—
kett are expected to take to the
air in an attempt to avenge
1955’s loss to the Car . And the
advantage of a familiar field
and a home crowd will be an
important one.

Coach Peterson is planning to
start with the same backfield
that out—gained Ripon last week
by 152 yards. Jack Shaffer and
Scotty Walker, who both aver
aged well over five yards per
carry a week ago, will do a
great part of the ball carrying.
Both boys are light, depend on
speed and shiftiness.

Gary Pattschull gained 77

yards in 16 carries at the Wis—,
I

during the race and finished
out of the running.

Thus the barriers lost their
first meet, although had the
team gotten just one break, its
record would still be unmarred.
This not to take anything away
from Teachers, for they were
the best-balanced team Grinneil
has met, this Year.

At Ripon sophomore Redman
Larry Larsen ﬂashed home first
over the 2.8~mile course in 15'
2". Shaleger and Weldon fol»
lowed.

Ripon took fourth place, but
the next five spots went to
Grinnellians Bacchus, Downs,
Boughey, Richter and Elliott.
