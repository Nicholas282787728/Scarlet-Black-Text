SPORTS
SCRAPS

liy Garland DeNelsky

In the only Olhcr Column
vhieh I have written thus tar,
I praised the sportsmanship of
he Crinnrll crowds in contrast
c that or other schools, Speclfr

lc‘dlly Cornell‘s.

I Stalcd that Grinnell follow
ers did not generally go over-
board or appear to he as lll-
mannered as Cornell‘s crowd
did. in essence i made a gens
crnhzation that Grinnetl's crowd
ls always hotter mannered than
Cornell's This same column
was reprinted in the Cornellian,
Cornell‘s student newspaper.

1 see now that i made a mis~
take In Monday night's game
with Cornell, a large portion ot
the Gl'lmlell spectators acted on
a level which can at best he
described as inianiilc. When we
visited Cornell two weeks ear.
liei, a group ot Gi-iuncll stu—

"borrowed” a Cornell
sign. oi the same type which is
located at the Highway ti side
oi our own campus

This select group then do-
cided that it would he altos
gothcr iitting to present the
sign to Cornell during the
game here. So the Cornell sign
was prominently displayed
ahove'a side basket on the
Griniiell side oi the gym.

The “borrowers” of the sign
'new exactly what would hap—
pcn. T y knew that some loyal
supporter (or group oi supporo
ers) would patriotically march
across the gym and demand the
sign back, the sign which. afler
all, w righttully theirs.
they also knew their own
curse of action. they would res
sist this attempt. They would
~oturn the sign when they were
early to.

The end result oi this can»
l’lict was pretty disgraeei'ul.
Several times ﬁst. ﬁghts broke
out, which immediately be-
cnmc so involved that a size-
ahle portion oi the crowd
rushed to the scene. Several
times the game had to be sus—
pended so that the iloor could
be cleared. Coach Piitsch was
iiually iorced to trek across
the gym {0 lry to Subdub the
crowd ,

All in oil the scene was not
fitting ot a supposedly—mature
college group. In tact, it looked
more like a cross-town rivalry
bcilrec-n two secondrrate high
schools who concenttatc more

producing inter—school tric-
tion than they do on watching
or winning a game.

it is truly a shame that so
iew can spoil things for so
many. But that is what hap-
pened Monday. The Grinnell
crowd, much more intensely
enthusiastic this year than in
many, all took a share or the l
lilame with them when they l
let't Dal-by.

Many iacnliy momhors, towns~
people and visitor undoubtedly
lelt with the iecung that stu—
dents at Grinliell leave a good
(lull to he desired in the way
ot mutur‘

i

Our athletic teams represent
our school. Our spectators at
athletic contests also do, per-
Imps oven to a greater degree
since there on: more oi them.
Both must not reasonably
well-mannered if students at
(i‘rrllulell are to be considered
any iit better than rowdy
junior high s iool pupils.

A l'ew decayed apples spoiled
the iruit oi good sport-nanship.

Dear tT om,
Good luck.
