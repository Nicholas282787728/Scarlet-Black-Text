' Aside from reporting; the campus activities and
events,,the S & B has tried this year to survey the news
with a critical eye, in the belief that criticism is a healthy
thing, necessary to avoid stagnation and ensure that quality
called ”gro ‘th." Grinnell is a good school, but like all in
stitutions, it has its faults. Not all of them received atten~
tion this year, and those must be left for another time.
Some of the olles which were exposed may not have been
defects; but the criticism was designed to stimulate a con-

That was the goal, and now with the year over- I'd
like to thank all those persons whose efforts and aid were
invaluable in the week to week publication of the S & B.

The masthead staff worked the hardest, and probably
contributed most to the paper: Ed, with his ideas filling a
rather large void, and his column producing interest, if not
always results, deserves great thanks. To Carol (Pub), my
thanks for taking over Carole Helgeson’s place at semesi

tion as “hardest working" and full gratitude for her work

The Mortar Board‘ regrets the
recent decision of the Board 01'
Publications concerning the per-
son trained for editor or the

portant lactor in the decision
was not the candidate's ability

as a journalist, but the alleged‘

damage done by his criticism

- of the collego.

is it possible that some mem-
bers of the Board oi Publicas
tions failed to understand the
nature and value or criticism
from within any institution?
When an institution fails to al-
low critic m, it no longer grows
and iuliills the needs ot its ln~
dividuals, but instead iorces
them into conicrmity.

To say that an institution is
a grc e ideal community does
not line t 50. The constructive
critic is not attempting to de-
story the institution, but to (167
fine its problems so that it may
strengthen its weak points.

We tool that it is also un~

fortunate that the Board ignored
the feelings expressed through
petitions by at least half the
student body.
We may not always agree
with the particular critic in
question, but feel we most up—
hold his right to criticize.
