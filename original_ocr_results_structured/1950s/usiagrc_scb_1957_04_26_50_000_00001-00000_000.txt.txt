Finds Grinnell Sixth In Nation

In a survey in the April

21 Chicago Sunday Tribune,

Grinnell was rated Sixth in the nation among ctr-education-

al liberal

' 5 colleges, The survey also included the top 10

in universltles, men’s colleges and Women’s colleges. .
The top 10 co»ed colleges Were rated in the followmg

Oberlin, Ohio;
more, Pennsylvania; Carleton,
Minnesota; Reed, Oregon; Po—
mona, California; Grinnell; Law—
rence, Wisconsin; College of
Wooster, Ohio; Kalamazoo, Mich-
igan; Hope, Michigan.

“We here at Crinnell already
knew that Grinnell is a fine
college," said President How-
ard it. Bowen, "but it is good
to have our confidence in our-
selves confirmed and reinforc-
ed. We are grateful to the
Tribune for initiating the
study.”

The author of the Survey,
Chesly Manly, interviewed more
than 50 university and College
presidents, faculty deans, schol-
ars, scientists and administra-
live officers.

The factors these consultants
considered in judging the schools
included the faculty, the quality
of research, as measured. by
publication, the student body,
physical. facilities, and Whether
or not the institution had the
character of a community oi
scholars.

Pcsident Bowen said, “The
listing of Grinnell among the
top 10 is all the more gratify—

ing because the whole Tribune
project came to us as a complete

surprise. No one here had been
consulted in any way, and the
listing thus indicates the
strength of Grinnell’s reputation
throughout the country."

‘Besides expert opinions. the

reporter collected more objec-
tive data of achievements and
distinctions of universitics and
colleges. For example, per<
iormance records of students
in large universities who had
come for graduate study or
transferred as undergraduates
were studied to rate the qual—
ity of instruction they had re—
ceived in other institutions.

“No doubt the Tribune listing
will arouse much controversy, as
would any other such rating,”
said Bowen. “Nevertheless the
study' appears to have been
thoroughly objective in its ap»
proach and based on sound edu»
cational standards, while the
authorities consulted are clear-
1y of high academic caliber.”

Future rticies in this series
on the hi nly rated schools will
undertake to show why these
institutions are great, what some
of their shortcomings are, and
what less distinguished colleges

and universities could (lo to im—
prove their standards.
