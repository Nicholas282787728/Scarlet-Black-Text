It is a shiftyreyed word

of the fence at once. For instance, many people take it tol

gests that one opinion is just as good (true or important) ‘
as another; that all ways of acting have the same (neither.

good nor had) result; that

If “tolerance” means this, I don’t want it. There is a

Mr Hopkins was concerned
largely with the negative re-

in the Middle East,'leading him
to believe that “We will not be

Middle East through Point

The blunt n-ankness of such
a declaration was gratifying
to hour, but the statement it-
self is highly disappointing
and rather. at variance with

After being on the campus

start out by saylllg that the
food management is certainly
not us good as it coulol be; we
seem lo be completely en—
tangled in “Thg Web."

We can get the tasteless pud-
dings down; we’ve gotten used
to the perpetual lettuce salad,
onc halfriilled glass of warm
milk, and microscopic desserts
and butter plaics;we don’finlnd
sending the bread plate back
six or seven times at dinner
(even lhough it must be hard
on waiter's feet).

All those nre trifles (yes, the
creamed unmentionable on
toast, too), but the other day
the soup incident was the last
straw. A new student in front
of us at lunch took a bowl of
our delightfully lhln bullion

Another “1 u c h complained
about feature of campus life is
curfew hours for women stu-
dents. We feel that if the wo-
men are named to hit the sack
at ll pun. every week night,
would make lousy wives
and sleepy partners on a late
date.

The cut system (instigation of
all three-day illnesses), pro-
hlbiting of Cal‘s on the campus
(“we‘re realistic at Grinnell"),
and study hall (“we mature inn
dependently at Grinnell") are
some of the, majordssues on
which there have been consider
able discussion.

The addition of the lumber

two private homes on north

tracks, cutting north campus off
from south, are some other fea—

aren’t too proud
