“The Titan,” Miss sternfeld
said is a documentary film which
recreates the work, life and
times of Michelangelo without
showing a glimpse of a human
actor. Shadows of actors and
statues that look almost alive
take care of the action. The
movie, which received an Acade;
my Award for the best feature
documentary, is narrated by
Frederic March ,with music by
Alois Melichar.

“Color Lithography, an Art:
Medium" depicts the steps that
bring to completion a three
>color lithograph and includes
examples of finished work
trom the third International
Biennial of color lithography.
This color iilm received
awards at the Ohio film tcsti-
val in Columbus and the
Golden Reel festival in Chie
cago.

The third movie portrays
masks and statues created by a
‘primltive people to help them
express emotions felt by all of
us in modern times. “Buma,”
the title of the film, Comes
from an African word meaning
fear. The film is in sound and
color. .

East Indian Dance

“The Fable of the Peacock”
shows authentic music and
dance of East India, featuring
dancer Lakshimi Wana Singh.
The color film unfolds a story,
told by stylized hand gestures
and body movements, accom-
panied by musicians using na-
tive instruments. There is a
narrative by the dancer Laks-
himi spoken in English.
