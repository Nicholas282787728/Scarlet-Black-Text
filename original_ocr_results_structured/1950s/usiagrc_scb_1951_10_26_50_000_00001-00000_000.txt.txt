To Broadcas’r'
Away Games

Nancy Postma. KGRW mane
ager, reported Wednesday
that students have responded
well to the radio stations apr
peal for funds to finance broad-
casting thc Season’s out—of-town
basketball games.

Grinnell will be the first col.
lege in the Midwest conference
to provide radio coverage of
games for students. The best
games will be broadcast since
there is not enough money raised
to finance broadcasts of all eight.

Announcers will be students
who work on their own time
and pay their own expenses.
The money collected will be
used only for the mechanical
aspects of production such as
wire which is leased from the
telephone company and paid for
per mile per quarter hour.

KGRW is working to extend
the transmission system so good
reception will be possible in
Loose hall by the time the game
broadcasts begin.
