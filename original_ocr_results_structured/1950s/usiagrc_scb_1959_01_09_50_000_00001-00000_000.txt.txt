Faculty Reviews Proposed Curriculum Changes

 

Bowen Reveals Dorm Plan

Construction of the new $405,-
000 men's residence is expected
to start next summer, with a
goal of completion for occupancy
set for the fall of 1960. Plans

were announced last week by
president Howard R. Bowen.
The residence, like the present
Younker building, will be divid—
ed into two halls, each with its
own lounge and recreational
area. The two halls together will

provide housing for so students
and a resident counselor. There
will be 40 double rooms and
18 singles.

The masonrysand-glass struc—
ture, three ﬂoors high, will be
located either on the hold north
of Cowles parking lot, or on the
field north of Tenth ave,
facing south. The building will
be 40 by 157 feet with a total
square footage of slightly over
20.000 feet. There will be a part

# System Includes Integration,
3 Individual Pursuit 01‘ Learning

A report consisting of recommendations for revision of
the present curriculum has been submitted to the faculty
by a committee headed by James H. Stallss (economics and

business),

The interim report, Stallss emphasizes, deals with pure-
ly tentative suggestions which will be “subject to faculty
discussion and debate and revision; after this consideration
there will be further study by the committee toward a
final report.” He also stressed that the program does “not
contemplate changes that would alter the educational plans

of students now in school."

The faculty met on Dec. 12 to
hear the explanation and interp-
retation of the report. At this
week’s meeting, it was decided
that the divisions and depart-
ments would review and debate

. the report in preparation for a

basement for storage and service
facilities.

Financing of the project is by
a loan from the Housing and
Home Finance agency of the
federal government. Skidmore,
Owings and Merrill of Chicago
are the architects. The contracts
will be let within the next few
months.

The new residence will in-
crease Grinnell’s housing for
men to nearly 500 in 11 halls.

 

Grinnell. Other Midwest Schools
To Share Ford Foundation Grant

Ten midwesl Colleges, including Grinnell, will Share in a grant
of $525,000 from the Ford Foundation. The grant was given to the
Associated Colleges of the Midwest to cover its basic costs for

five years.

The associated Colleges. founded last October, includes ten
midwest schools: Knox and Monmouth of Illinois; Cue, Cornell and

Grinnell of Iowa; Carleton and
St. Olaf of Minnesota; and Be-
loit, Lawrence and Ripon of
Wisconsin.

The grant of $525,000 plus an
initial grant by the Ford Foun-
dation last August of $25,000
will be combined with funds
raised by the Associated Cole
leges to conduct study and ex-
periments in such fields as scho-
larships and loans, effects of
various class size, effects of in-
dependent study by students
and trends in academic curri—
cula. According to the spokes-
man for the Ford Foundation,
many other fields, such as the
exchange of lectures and cone
certs, a summer school to be
held at a different school each
year, and a joint press could
be explored, and that each col-
lege would be independent in
its own affairs.

Dean Blair Stewart of Ober—
lin college has been named the
iirst president of the organi—
zation. His appointment was
announced bv Russell D, Colc.
president of Cornell college, and
rhairmnn of the executive come

Oberlin for ten years as dean
of the college of arts and

sciences and professor of eco-
nomics, will begin his new job
July 1, 1959.

Cole, in a press release Wed-
nesday, said of the Associated
Colleges of the Midwest, “The
members . . . .’have had a long

association and they will now
be able to do, as a group, what
they are not zlble to do indie
vidually . . . . It<Associated Col-
leges) will show what can be
accomplished in improving the
educational effectiveness and op-
eration efficiency of individual
colleges when they approach
problems together."

Shows Gains

In December

Almost $2,000,000 has been
paid or pledged by mid—Decem-
ber toward the $2,460,000 goal
in Grinnell’s current develop-
ment campaign. The funds will
be used to finance the new li-
braty, remodeling the 'old li-
brary into classrooms and of-
fices and finance the new fine
arts center.

The new library, now under
construction, is expected to be
ready for use next fall.
President nownrd R. Bowen
said of the new fine arts cen-
ter, "We should be able to
point to progress on this
building by next fall, at the
same time completion of the
new library becomes a real-
lty.”

Much of the recently pledged
contributions came from the
area drives now being complet-
ed in Chicago and on'the East
coast.

meeting in the third week of

GRADUATION
REQUIREMENTS

According to the report, the
rationale of a general curricular
pattern “is basically a matter of

conception of student progress
toward graduation.”

The following requirements
have been suggested “to govern
the distribution of courses among
broad curricular areas of the
liberal arts: freshman studies—
eight credits, sophomore studies
~0ul‘ credits, junior compre-
hensive examination—four cred-
its. natural sciences and mathe-
matics—ll credits, modern Eur-
opean history—four credits, for«
eignlanguage_14 credits, fine
arts—f o u r credits, religioni
three credits and physical edu-
cation—two credits.

While the freshman and sophr
omore studies and the junior ex.
aminations will be irreducible,
the other requirements might be
exempted on the basis of exam.
inations and other departmental
exemption procedures. The re-
ligion requirement would be a
course in comparative religions.

122 CREDITS REQUIRED

The total number of credit
hours required for graduation
would be 122, including a min-
imum of 30 credits in the field
of concentration and 40 credits
(exclusive of the junior com-
prehensive examination) in C
and D level courses.

“In view of the graduation re-
quirements outlined above, a
minimum of 63 credits would be
available for courses in the
field of concentration and for
elective courses. The actual num~
ber of credits available to a
student would usually be great-
cr, depending on (1) number of
credits in meeting general re—
quirements which also go into
meeting the requirements of 30
credits for the field of concen-
tration and (2) number of
credits deducted from the gen-
ernl requirements upon exemp-
tion." . . The graduation re-
quirement of a total of 122
credits would permit students to
carrv a course-load averaging 15
credits per semester.

CURRICULAE PATTERN

The committee’s recommenda-
tions for fulfillment of the
graduation requirements are
found in the suggested general
curricular pattern In the fresh
man year, a four-ecourse plan
would dominnte; the typical stu—
dent would carry a laboratory
science, a forcign language, the
aonl'opl'izlle “freshman studies"
course (to be explained latcrl
and another course. The present
plan of study for “distinction”
would be continued and im

proved for unusually capable
students.
sornomoxns EXPLORE

in the sophomore year, the
student would devote his ef-
forts to “exploring interests
(and) making substantial pro-
gress toward completion of the
general requirements for gradu-
ation.” This would be imple—
mented by a wide range of
three credit ”elementary" cour-
ses. Although the four—course
plan would be favored,.sopho»
mores carrying only one four
hour course might take five
courses in a semester.

Sophomore studies would be
required for all. Sophomore in»
dependent projects would be
made available to unusually
capable students, qualified by
work in one of the ”elementary"
courses. and would be on the
C level, carrying two credit
hours.

JUNIOR COMP ‘smmncm‘

The report refers to the jun-
ior comprehensive examination
as "the most significant event
of the junior year," Embracing
achievement in the liberal arts
and progress in the field of con-
centration, the examination
would also guide the student
and his advisers in planning his
senior program.

To prepare for the examina-
tion, the junior would carry a
three-course academic load dur-
ing the second semester, devot-
ing the added time to "junior
readings." A three credit-hour
junior independent project
would be offered to qualified
students in either or in both
semesters.

Culmiliating his college ca-
reer, the senior would pursue a
four-course plan, “tailor-made"
to his capabilities and interests,
“though within the framework of
requirements for the field of
concentration and in View of the
direction given by the junior
comprehensive examination. All
students would engage. but in
varying amounts, in some form
of independent study. Each stu-
dent would be expected to un—
dertake substantial responsibility
for his own education."

C AND D LEVEL COURSES

Courses offered to the senior
would include a range of C and
D level courses in the major
field. D courses would include
a senior independent project
“which would be available to
the student for one semester or,
according to his qualifications,
for each of both semesters; and
further, would include any
course or courses considered “ad-
vanccd.”

With the exception of the jun-
ior independent, all C and D
courses will carry four credits.

The C courses might also in-
clude. at the department's dis-
cretion. one or more seminars
oriented in reading and writing
and other "project" work,
coupled with group discussion
of student work.
