saw on posters several times‘
during our trip. We were also
greeted once by pioneers cn—.
thusiastically singing the tollow— ;
ing “hymn” to Lenin.

LENIN IS ALWAYS WITH YOU

Day by day the years pass—l

The dawn or new generations,
But no one will ever i
Forget the name: LENIN .‘

Refrain:
Lenin is always alive, l
Lenin is always with you
In misfortune, in hope and in

gladness. ,
Lenin is in your happy days,
Lenin is in you and in me.

In a moment long ago,

On the dawn of Soviet power

He said, that we shall create,
happiness

For the people
world.

We are following the party

Glorifying our motherland‘
with our deeds.

And on this long way

Lenin is with us in each deed,

Does this sound like I'ational‘
Soviet atheism? The ceremony,
of pilgrimage" to the tomb of'
Lenin and Stalin, and the “re—i
ligious experience" some encoun-
ter as they pass the bodies of
their leaders are further ex-
amples of this feeling.

The willingness to sacrifice
. . l to turn the other cheek
. . . to go the second mile; the
hope that their lives will he
well spent in the furthering of
communism and Socialism — i
such ideas represent the “rec
ligious fervor” of the tow
truly dedicated Communists
we met this summer.

in most discussions with stu—
dents on the religious question,
both in public and in private,
we found them falling back to
dialectical determinism and plac—
ing their faith in science. Their
attitude toward us, as repres
sentativ s of a Christian group.
was varied, but usually fell
into one at two categories i

Some ridiculed‘our position, i

with such comments as, “How ,
can an intelligent person be-
lieve in Gilli?" or, “In a few .
years you will be wiser, and l

no longer believe," The other 1
attitude, quite common, was l
that of tolerance. “If it works

for you. lino, hut for me it

just doesn't work.” i

How does one attempt to
evaluate such'a diversity of exr
perlenCC" It would be easy, if
one had an hypothesis he were
trying to prove. He would sim—
ply take the facts which support
his stand and discard the rest
as unreliable. In this way one
could “prove" that religion is
dying out, or that the church is
holding its own, or that Chris-
tianity is lacing replaced by
Communism, or a variety of
other statements. l
