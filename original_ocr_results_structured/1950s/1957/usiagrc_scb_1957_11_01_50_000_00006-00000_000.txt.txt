LIGHT UP A

NO SORRIER WARRIOR exists than the one without
Luckies. What’s he missing? A smoke that’s as light as
they come! End to end, a Lucky is made of superbly light
tobacco—golden rich, wonderfully goodstasting tobacco
that’s toasted to taste even better. That’s a lot to miss out
onino wonder our chief has grief! Up North, you’d call
him a Blue Sioux; back East, a Bleak Creek. But out in
the land of the pueblo, he’s just a mighty Mopey Hopi.
(Smoke signal to you: Light up a Lucky. You’ll agree a
light smoke’s the right smoke for you!)

Bob Grindy was the man rt:-
sponsiblc tor our 676 tie with
Cornell. Ii ho had made a good
pass from center in the conver—
sion atcmot tho Pionccrs might
have edgod their opponents 776.

I mention this to point out
that there were a lot oi Grills
dy’s in tho Unitod states last
Saturday, and the Saturday he-
‘l'url: that. and therc‘ll always
be a lot of Gl'intlys~bemusc
to err s a most common 007
curreucc in sports . . i . .
Homecoming game is a nerve-
nrorking dfl'ilir: 1.500 sci-cam.
ing tans increase the tensencss.
Grindy was entitled to that
costly mistake bccanse be,
more than any one of 22 men
on Word licld at that time,
was burdened with an unbe-
lierahle amount or pressure.

The 180 pound center is a
really good ball player. the kind
who‘s respected hy his team—
inatcs as ”all guts" Grindy has

played a lot of tootball-yct he'd
trade even eat minute he can
call his own for a chance to re-
renter that ball.

The mental anguish snitered
by "G" and the other 29 Pic»
ncers at that moment was
overwhelming. A consensus of
the crowd would have been an
invidions "never let the guy
play again". But, his coach
and teaininates' reaction—the

' one that Cuulited»was “miss
takes are a part of the game,
let’s make it up in another
way." Here is exempliﬁed one
of the most rewarding facets
oi sports: the understanding
and torcciul oneness tostercd
by those who are a part at the
football (in, this case) organe
ization.

Thc Convocation was a suc—
cess in every Way. 1 saw pro»

portionatety as much brawn as
'bl'ain participating in the week—
end’s intellectual activities. The
:athlete assumes a role of lead-
;ership in a college atmosphere.
He is therefore judged, in all his
,actions, with a critical eye,

The Grinncll sportsman left

.l little to be desired in his realiza-

ltion ot the Values offered dur-
ing the three-day Course of
.events. He stood out as a man of
many interests.
