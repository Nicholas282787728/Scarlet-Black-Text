January 25. I957

By .1 Arthur

Tom Doyle pulled off his jer—
sey for the last time as a Grin-
nell eager after Tuesday's game
with Wartburg. His eligibility
ends with the current semester
since he played one semester at
Villanova before coming to Grin-
nell. During three years on the
Grinnell varsity Doyle sent 370
points through the haap.

Tom hails from Jersey City,
NJ. and finds life on the East
coast more to his liking than
the Mid-Western atmosphere
he has experienced while at-
tending Grinnell. He spends
his summer time at a race
track as a jockey, though not
in the usual sense. Tom is a
car jockey, parking cars for
racing fans.

Basketball ranks first in
Doyle’s list of interests but: he
also enjoys swimming and card
playing in his spare time. One
0: his other diversions is “rock
’n roll” music to which he occa.
sionally makes his own contri-
bution in the shower on Lang
an third.

Tom’s greatest moment in
sports while in athletics at Grin.
nell was the Pioneers’ defeat of
Coe 75.65 in a game early last
season.

Doyle hesitates to select a shot
as his “best” but admits that
his favorite shot is a jump shot
This shot produced two vital
buckets in the Wartburg game
Tuesday night.

After graduating :.-om Grim
nell Tom plans to serve a bitch
in the army and then find a
job in business or industry.
Although he is majoring. in
history Tom confesses that he

has a suppressed desire to he
a coach.

Tom is an easy going guy with
an ever ready “Ipana” smile
who says that his most arduous
task is getting out of bed in the
morning His roommate testi-
fies that “Getting ‘Buckets’ up,

in the morning is a three- -man
job."

In games to come the Pio-
neers will miss the presence of

Tom Doyle, a gDod competitor
for Lhree years.

floor by a scoré of 96777. Wart-
burg piled up a zoepoint lead
with fourteen minutes gone of
the first pcriod and were never
in danger after that. The score
at halltlme was 49-31, ‘

Grinneil was without the
services of Larry Koch who
was ill and Bob Mchmsey
was out with a bad shoulder.
One bright spot, however, was
the return to the line-up of
George Susens, who has been
on since the early part of the
season with a back injury.

Art Margheim of Wartburg
hit thirteen field goals for 26
points to take individual scar-
ing honors for the night. He

was followed by Grinncll's John
Copeland with 22 and also by
Dick Crawl who had 18 Dolnts.

started the game, came through
with 12 points.

This game marked the end of

the cage career of Tom Doyle

who is lost to the team through

ineligibility.
