By John Smith

Grinnell college Will field
a baseball team this spring
for the first time since World
War 1. About 20 candidates
are drilling- dailv under the
guidance of Coach John
Pfltsch. The squad has been
working out since Mann 4.

Much oi the team’s success
will depend on the early spring
weather. The pleasant weather
we have enjoyed this week has
made it possible tor the team
to get in some ocneiicinl out
door sessions. Grinnell will be
competing in the southern di-
vision oi the Midwest coniei»
once which includes Ccc, Cor-
nell, Knox. and Monmouth.

The outdoor practices are be-
ing stag-ed on n diamond one
mile south oi the campus on
East nvc. These are the best
iuoiiitics available at this
time, but it is hoped that our
own campus diamond, near
the stables, will be seeded and
resdy ior use in time tor the
1958 season.

Plitsch says that bleachers
l are being provided on the south
diamond and he hopes that the
inconvenience of the distance
from the rumpus will not pre-
vent interested students from
irattending the games. New unis
.Iol'ms and equipment including
la batting cage, are in use as
lbaseball gets under way again
l at Grinnell.

The majority of baseball hope~
ltuls participate in other varsity
{sports It is too early to form

detinite conclusions as to the
lpoterttial of the team but the
fbaseball team is expected to be
on a par uith other intercolleg-
liate athletics Most oi the men
lhaven‘t been competing in sum—
mer baseball recently and this
‘is one of the problems Pfitsch
will face in molding a winning
lcombination as baseball is re-
‘ ViVeCl here. Some time will have
‘to he spent in expernrtentation
to {incl the best combinations,
betting order, etc.

l A major part at the game
l of baseball is, or course, pitch-
‘ ing, and Piitsch is fortunate
i in having three experienced
I twirlcrs in Dick- Crawl, Bud
l Rocgge, and Dwight Nissan
.‘ This trip has had the naval-its
. age of playing during the
summer, and they should form
l a wood nucleus on which to
build.

In their early drills the Squad
has shown a keen spirit» and
this, coupled with the student

‘interest, which has been ex
‘pressed regarding baseball,
should. provide a worthwhile
;addition to the Grinnell athletic
I program.
