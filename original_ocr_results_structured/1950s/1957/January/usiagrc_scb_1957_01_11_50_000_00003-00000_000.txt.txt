Seeks To Siren

Harold L Clapp (romance languages) is in Washing-
ton, D. C. this year serving as executive secretary of the
newly—formed Council for Basic Education.

Clapp, granted a leave of absence for the academic year
1956-57, is quoted ill Time magazine, Dec. 24, 1956, as say—
ing “through theii stranglehold on education, U. S. educa-

tional theorists have so diluted
the academic content of the
public school that it now lags
far behind those in Europe"

The Council for Basic Edu-
cation is the outgrowth of
meetings begun in November,
1954, in New York City. by a
“group of individuals who had
been active in urging, through
writings and speeches, an in-
creased emphasis upon the
fundamental intellectual dis-
ciplines in the public schools."

The council expects to ”,be-
come a focus for the various
scattered efforts now being
made to strengthen the basic
disciplines of the public—school
curriculum," thereby “present—
ing a united front of all groups
interested in the fundamental
subjects,”

Howard A. Meyerhoff, who is
executive director of the Scien-
tific Manpower~commission in
Washington, is serving as chair—
man ’for organizational matters.
Paxton Blair, former New York
supreme court justice, is the
temporary board’s legal coun-
sel, and the corresponding sec—
retaries are Clapp, for associated
organizations, and Arthur Bestor,
University of Illinois history
professor, for individuals.

“Though public-school men
have already begun to de—
nounce it as overly doctrinaire
and often un'just in its criti-
cisms, the council hopes to be—
:come a major clearing house
of information for parents and
teachers who are worried
about present standards," con-
cluded Time.

Clapp, a member of Phi Beta
Kappa and various professional

,organlzations, has been a state

and national officer of the Am-
erican Association of University
Professors and has Written num-

erous articles not only in his
own field illut on education in
