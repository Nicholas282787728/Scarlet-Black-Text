1957 Convention
Workings Explained

By Steve MacDonald
and Neil Horton ‘

A great deal of confusion
seems to hone arisen about
convention rules and regula-
tions

The convention will run some-
thing like‘this: student Coun-
cil President Art Travers will
open the éonventi n by reading
the rules in detail). Then a roll
of all hall delegations will
he called alphabetically to de-
termine that the correct num-
ber of certified delegates are
present

Each hall will<be allowed one
convention )delegate for every
four persons living in the hall.
The delegates for the halls are
as follows:

North campus. Clark ll-
Cowles la; Dibble, 12, Gates,
11; Langan, 14- North Younker,
l3; Rawson ll; Smith, 13; South
Younker, 17.

. South campus: Cleveland, ll;
Haines. 16; James, 13; Loose,
22; Main, 14; Read, ls.

A total ot 73 convention votes
is necessary to nominate a can—
didatei Both or the candidates
must be nominated on the same
ballot.

Next comes the second 1011
call, Once again the halls will
be called in alphabetical order,
and each hall will have an op-
partunity ’to nominate candle
dates, Each hall may nominate
as many people as it desires.

Only candidates who have
submitted petitions to the
Election board by Feb. 14 will
he nominated. This year there

will be no nominations from
the floor.

All nominations must be Com-
pleted on the second rDll call,
alter which the balloting begins,
After the first ballot, which is
instructed, the delegates are
free to vote for any candidate
they please.

Two particular—rules of the
convention, the “pass” and
"yield” trules, msty cause some
contusion in the minds or dale
gates, ,

The “llass” rule simply
states that any hall not wish-
‘ing to vote in ’ alphahetioal
order may pass to the em].
This may be done only once
on each-ballot.

The "yield" rule is more com-
plicated and can best be ex-
plaincd by example, Let us as-

sume that Hall A-is ﬁrst. Hall
A may agree to “yield" to Hall

7. on the nominating ballot, in
which case Hall z would name
inatc iirst. then Hall A, then
B, and so Iorth Hall 2 would
then be skipped when its regu-
lar turn came.

A hall may pass, yield or
nominate on the nominating
roll call. Halls nominating a
candidate may not then yield.

The problem of "recognition”
has also caused confusion. when
a hall is named on the home
mating roll roll. the delegate
chairman may recognize only
one person tor the purpose of
nominating a candidate and any
number of people for the pur-
pose of soconding that nomina~
tion. or course, no hall will be
allowed m run over the alloted
15 minute time limit.
