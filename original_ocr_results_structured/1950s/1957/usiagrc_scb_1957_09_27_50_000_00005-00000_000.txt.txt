l-larriers Challenge

St. Olaf,

By Noel Bacchus

Throughout the month of
September, while most col-
legiate minds are preoccupied
with football practices, regis-
tration procednies and the
outcome of major league
baseball, small groups of
athletes throughout the country
are steadily building condition
by calisthenics, weight-training
and interval running for the
start of the 1957 cross-country
season.

Tomorrow afternoon, the Pio-
neer squad will make its 1957
cross-country debut in a tri-
angular meet against Iowa state
Teachers college and St. Olaf
over a 21/2 mile home course.

Spearheaded by Captain John
Welden, veteran of two success-
ful cross-country seasons, and
Chuck Yoak, one of last year’s
top runners, the team has
enough depth, from a trio of

ers for the Midwest conference
title. l

in the last two years, Grim
nell teams have won the 1955
conference title and taken
second place in the 1956 cam
ference met. This year the
loss of Larry Schaleger, who
won the loss outstanding ath—
letc award, and also of voter-
ans Bob Downs and Noel Bac-
chus, is being partially offset
by newcomers Walt Necvel,
Art Risser, Louis Sachs and
Chris King.

usual this year, the squad, ex'
cept for a few colds and Neevel’s
wrenched knee, has kept level
with the times for correspond-
ing trials of last year's squad.
Yoak, who has been handicap-
ped by a cold for over a week
will probably be somewhat
weakened, while Neevel, who

in this meet,

of the opposing teams, lowa
state Teachers will probably be
the strongest.

ISTC was one of the only two
teams that defeated the Pio-
neers last year, and having lost
only one member of that team,
should offer the Grinnell squad
some stiff opposition. ,

The st, Olaf team also re-
tains some of last year‘s top
conference men, and although
defeated by Grinnell on their.
home course last year in the
first meet of the season, the
Oles should constitute a
threat this year because of in.
creased strength and exper—
ience.

coacn H‘V Simone has again
used the method of interval run—
ning as the core of his training
program, with time trials inter-
spersed regularly, This type of
training becomes intensified as
the conference meet draws closer
with the intention of bringing
the athletes to the peak of con-
dition during the week prior to

the conference meet,

A colorful and partisan car
pacity crowd of 3000 jammed
Ward field in sunny fall weath-
er, to witness Grinnell's spirited
bid to upset the favored Ko-
hawks fall short. The Pioneers
were gunning for their first
opening triumph in seven years,
and their first win over Coe
since 1949.

After,three weeks of pre-
season preparation both squads
were "up" for the Contest.
But, it was Coc’s greater depth
and pinpoint passing attack
that impressively. withstood
’Grinnell rallies in the first
and fourth quarters. A success-
ful air attack awarded the
Pioneers n lit—13 halftime lead.
Coo then unleashed a four-
touchdown bombardment in
the second half taking the
lead. All but four Pioneers
were pressed into action.

Working out of the single-
wing, Grinnel] introduced a
formidable offensive that earned
it a 15—7 lead after the first
quarter. Coe drew first blood
early in the contest when quar—
terback Jerry Stonebarger, who
spearheaded the Kohawks by
running and throwing for 190
vards, passed on yards to Jim
Troy for a touchdown. Grinnell
returned the kickoff to the Cote
9 in a steady downfield march
which was suddenly thwarted
by a pass interception by coe

‘ on their own 2. Two plays later, ,

Chuck Adams and
Minzrd Hulse scored a safety
for Grinnell by tackling Troy
in his own end zone.

At this point 5' 6" 145-110qu .
John Copeland, in his first
football ‘game for Grinncll,
stole the limeight from Stone-
The dlmunitive tail-
back passed to end Jerry
KIII'Lh, a, standout tackle for
the past two seasons, and to
hack Dave Allen for two quick
Pioneer touchdowns. Copeland
eventually pa§ed for all four‘
Grinnell scores, completing s
of 18 losses for 113 yards. He
gained an additional 43 on the
ground.

Stonebarger again teamed
with Troy early in the second
period, Cutting Grinnell's half-
time margin to 16-13, but not
until the third quarter did the
Pioneers show signs of fatigue.
Two end runs and a gamble
passsplay clicked for three quick
Cue touchdowns. The Kohawks
added another, soon after the
opening minutes of the fourth
quarter.

Behind by a 41-16 count, Grin<
nell gained some ground as full-
back Larry Dukes and haliback
Jack Shaffer beat out consistent
first downs. Copeland then pass—
ed to Kurth in the end zone,
for a points, and later tossed a
23ryard aerial, with three min—
utes remaining in the, game, to
end Lee Moses for Grinnell’s
last tally.
