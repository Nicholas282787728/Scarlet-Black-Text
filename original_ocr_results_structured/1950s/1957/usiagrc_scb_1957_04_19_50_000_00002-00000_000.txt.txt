Books’rore Prices

The Student Council in its
regular Wednesday meeting
discussed transcript lssu—
ance. fees, and other func-
tions of the registrar’s office
with Givens L. Thornton,
registrar. other business includ~
ed a report on the operation of
the college bookstore, a recom-
mendation on student paychecks
and a decismn to submit a re
quest to President Howard 3.
Bowen, that the library remain
open, during the Wednesday
chapel hour.

In a discussion of student
complaints on delay in pre-
paring transcripts, Thornton
said that deadlines for appli-
cations for fellowships and
scholarships had been care.
fully observed and that no
student had lost an opportun-
ity by the delay. A two week
delay in preparing trans-
cripls for two students was
caused by the absence of the
employee who normally pre»

pares them. ,

In regard to transfer students
Thornton said that the regis-
trar’s office does not record or
transfer grades from another in:
stitution. Credits only are trans-l
ferred. Grades received in an-
other institution,are not added
info a student's cummulative
grade average.

Beginning this spring stue
dents will be required to regis—
ter for ,a whole year instead of
one semester. Changes will be
permitted in January with the
consent of students" advisers.

Thornton also exhibited new

tion and gritde' recording. They

forms which will greatly sim-
plify arid shorten the time
necessary for registration and

Pete Dooley reported on in-
quiries which he was directed to
make regarding the operation of
the college bookstore. He re-
ported that the reasons why the

Rosewell Garst, has thrice been

bookstore does not have a larger
selection of good paper backs is
that there aren’t enough dis-
play shelves available and that
students do not buy enough of
these books to make it profit-
able to stock them.

Dooley also found that text
books are sold at the book-
store with a 20 percent mark
up. Ordinarily retail book
stores operate on about an 18
per cent mark up, he said.
More inquiry and considera—
tion are to be given to the
operation of the bookstore
with-a view to improving its
services.

On the basis of a student vote
the Student Council decided to
ask Dr. Bowen to .consider
opening the library during the
Wednesday chapel hour. The
vote indicated a substantial ma-
jority ,of the students are in fa.
vor of having the library open
at that time.

Of An 'Ogre'

Dispelled ln Talk Wiih Norton

By Judy Morgan
On this campus there is a group about which very
little is linowll. The Committee on Academic Standing
appears to many students an ogTe which swoops out of its
hidden lair at regular intervals to pounce on unsuspecting
students and force their retreat from the campus.

“Actually this committee does
not go around seeking students
to kick out of school," states R.
Homer Norton, dean of the cola
lege and chairman of the com»
mittee. “Each case is consid—
ered individually. The real rea
son for dropping a student is
that he‘ seems to be losing his
chance for graduation, and for
him to remain here in academic
jeopardy would be unfair to
him and his parents." ,

Although the function of
recommending the dismissal of
students who have fallen be-
low the academic standards is
the one for which the com.
mittee is known, it does have

many other duties within its

jurisdiction.

The committee sets up the
criteria for academic probation,
ineligibility, dismissal, classifcar
tion and class attendance. It
prepares for faculty approval of
the college calendar, the list of
candidates for degrees and the
rules governing makeup exam-
inations and final examinations
(including the final examina—
tion schedule), -

The committee acts on petir
tions concerning special exam-
inations, speciah course/ loads,
absences, incomplete grades and

readmission of a student drop.
ped for academic deficiency. A
subcommittee on academic dis-

honesty handles all cases of
misconduct in the classroom
and dishonesty in written Work.

Most of the academic regu—
lations within the jurisdiction
of the committee are in the
Student Handbook The pres
ent rules were set up in 1955.
Each year the committee goes
over th rules, making charges
or ad ons where it deems
it necessary. “The oohunittee
has shown no disposition to
change radically any of the
rules which are now in effect,"
adds Norton.

The committee consists of
Norton, Dean of Men, Harry A.
Grace, Dean of Women, Evelyn
Gardner, the Registrar, Givens
L. Thorton and o. H. Haupt- '
mann, chairman of the faculty.
Four faculty members elected
by the faculty to serve two-
year terms on the committee
are currently Kenneth A. Chris—
tiansen (biology), Grace E. Hun-
ter (English), Kenyon A. Knopf
(economics), John R. Klein-
schmidt (modern foreign lang<
uages). '
