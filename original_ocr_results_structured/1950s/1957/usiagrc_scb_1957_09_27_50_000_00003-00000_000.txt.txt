Preps To Undergo
Modified Program

By Bill Mcciung

When the C of HP prepar—
ed this year‘s prepping pro-
gram it had in mind the de-
velopment and adjustment of
the freshmen, and left the
sopllomoric uppercla s s m e n
wielding paddles and direct-
ing line-up interrogations in
the not so dim past.

Consequently, when prepping
begins Oct. 7, the freshmen will
receive fewer “swam," will have
fewer time-consuming tasks,
and will have more constructive
requirements to meet than in
the past. The two—week period
before the program starts has
been set aside to enable the
freshmen m begin their studies
Without any restrictions which
could lbe detrimental to their
class Work.

Prepping requirements in-
clude a grade point average of
no less than 1.75, a record of no
more than three disciplinary
fines, and an amassed total at
least duo merit points obtained
through college and hall activity
participation.

Failure to meet these and
other requirements will result in
non-admittance into the halls’
membership. .

The program will last for the
entire first semester. Hazing,
that part of prepping which irr-
eludes “swats,” shoe—shining and
various other prep tasks and reg-
ulations, will take place between
Oct, 7 and Nov. 4 in a limited

fashion, and the whole hazing
program will he in effect during
“Hell Week" between Nov. 4
and Nov, 9 as outlined in the
Men‘s Handbook.

Freshmen who satisfactorily
complete the program will he
formally initiated into the hall
early in the second semester.

Afler Summer Safari In Southwestern Arizona,
Biology Siudenls Return Wilh Wildlife Specimens

By Anita Parkhurst

To the tune of “I‘ll sing you one ho" and “I’ve got Sixpence,” nine biology students
and their instructor, Kenneth A. Cllristiansen (biology) traveled to southeastern Ari-
zona this summer for firsthand study‘of the wildlife of that area. The group left Grin-
nell in the college station wagons August 18 and returned five blowouts, one broken axle,

13 rattlesnakes, one coati mun-
di, two porcupines, and assort-
ed lizards, loads, tarantulas and
scorpions later, on Sept. 16,‘

The purpose of the trip was
to visit the Southwest research
station in the Coronado national
forest, which is a non-profit or-
ganization run as an adjunct of
the American Museum of Nat»
ural History in New York.
Founded by a grant from the
American Science foundation,
the station is now self—sustaining
and offers to individual scien<
tists or college'groups, such as
the one from G ‘nnell, extensive
laboratory fac es and a land
area for study which includes
extremes from mountainous for-
ested regions to arid yucca des-
ert. The Grinnellians were the
first undergraduate ’group to
take advantage of these facili-
ties and the first group to stay
as long as three weeks.

0n the way to the station
the group camped for two days
at Wolfcreek pass in the south.
ern Colorado Rockies 'to ob-t
serve the unusual mountain
formations in that'area.
Taking part in the expedition
were Nancy Egbert, Paula Kirt

Pat Adams, Andy Johnson, Betsy
Patterson, Doug Robinson, and
Steve Rogers.

 

Out On Excursions

The biologists slept in cabins
at the station and ate most of
their meals cafeteria style, except
when on collecting excursions. A
typical day included collecting
during the day and lab work
in the evening. Many days,
however, were atypical.

The first week, one day was
spent exploring each of the life
zones, ranging from the desert to
the top of the Chiracahua moun—
tains. Each member of the group
had a project for the three-week
stay. One proposed project, the
study of animals living in an uric
explored cave in the area was
thwarted because no one could
wriggle through its inner pas-
sages. They did find a few rabid
bats.

Five of the six varieties of
rattlers found in the area were
also collected along with a
large bull snake. This was a
good your for the trip, Christ-
iansen said, because there was
an ahaveaverage amount of
rain and the desert was bril-
liantly colored with hiooming
cacti.

An all-night ”blanket party,”
a little hit out of the Grinnell
tradition, took placelin the des-
ert one night. The purpose:

light—trapping of insects. Every-
one sat up until eleven playing
bridge. Then they set up a white

Cooking, Coali Chases

Three of the boys climbed the
mountain to a cabin at the top
charge of meals which always
included ltalian spaghetti and
twice, pikplum without short-
ening and raspberry jello with
apricots. The spaghetti got in»
creasingly better; it was a thick
paste by the last night.

Catching the coatl (a ra-
coon—likc animal) was equiv-
alent to a three—ring circus.
After cornering it in a tree,
“Don C," stationed biologists
with nets under it and scur-
ried up to direct operations.
The coati jumpedjntt) the not,
right back out again, and un-

biologists after it. Finally it
ran hack up into the tree to
find itself face to face with

a clothesline below, tight-rope
ran for a while and died of
either .1 heart attack or ex-
haustion.

Blowouts on the way down
seemed serious at first 'because
in station wagons the spare is
kept under the floor in the back
—under everything else. (In
fact, the romantics in the group
decided to bring back some
mistletoe, but had to stow it
under the front seat for want of
space.) They became quite effi-
