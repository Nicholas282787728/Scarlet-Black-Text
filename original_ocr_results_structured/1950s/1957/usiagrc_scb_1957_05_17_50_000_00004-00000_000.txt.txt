MICKEV MANTLE'S ADVICE:

Him & Willis-men room um,

By Peter Bradford

Today and tomorrow the
varsity tennis team will be
competing for the conference
ichampionship at Monmouth
tend Knox. With an 8-1 dual
Imeet season to their credit
the Pioneers are given a
strong chance to dethrone
Lawrence’s defending
champs.

The meat is set up so that
each school enters its four best
‘players (who are ranked 1, 2,
‘3, 4) for singles and then pairs
them for two doubles teams.
Singles championships are de-
cided in four classes with all
number one men in the same
class, and so on.

‘ Dick Katz is representing

Grinncll in the number one
singles spot. He Should re-

 

ceive a ton seeding, based on
his record this season, which
assures him of meeting one
of the other three top seeded
players only in the semi-fins
als, if any place. In this way
the {our top—seeded players
or each class are given con~
siderution for their ahility
and the meet is strengthened
because oi it. Katz has de—
fented Larry Leider ot Carlee
ton who recently upset the
defending champion, Ron
Kleber or St. Olaf. nick
Rina of Lawrence, the 1955
champ. will also be on hand
tor what should he a real
battle for the numher one
championship.

Playing number two for the
Pioneers is Jim Hautzinger who
played very fine tennis in last
year’s second place finish by
the Grinnellians. He also should
receive a Lopeseeding because
of his record. Larry Koch, who

will team with Hautz for the
second doubles team. is playing
number four and is given a
very good chance to win that
division. Larry is always dan-
gerous and what he lacks in
form he more than makes up
for in desire and tenacity.

The steady hand of sopho-
more Bill Hahn is holding the
number three Pioneer racket.
Bill is one or the top eouteud-
ers for victory in that class,
and he and Kata will combine
tor what should be a very
potent first doubles team

As I have said, the meet will
nail down to a battle between
Grinnell and Lawrence with
this writer giving the nod to
the Pioneers on the basis of an
excellent season to date and a
great desire to knock off a
Lawrence team which might
well be taking another cham-
pionship for granted.

‘ CHAMPSC“! Ace tennis squad of Hahn, Kalz, Hautzinger and Koch take a break to contem-
plate what‘s in store at the MWC championships this weekend.

 

and walked seven. The extra
inning game was broken up in
the top halt of the eighth. when
Armin Scharfe smashed a hard
‘htt single to centerfield, driving
in the winning run.

The afternoon game against
,Knox told another story as the
tGrinnellians dropped it 4—1. it
was a tight pitching duel until
lthe last inning. Dwight Nissen
pitched against Phil Blair of
‘Knox. The Siwashers scored in
the bottom oi the second only
to be tied by the Pioneers in
the top of the fourth. in the
bottom of the sixth Nissen al-
lowed the first hatter a single.

The next batter sacrificed
the runner to second killing
any chance of a double-play.
Nissen walked the next nian
making it one out with run-
ners on iirst and second. The
Knox centeriielder, Ahels,
then tripled to right—center
driving in two runs. Barth
then added to his own cause
by driving in Abels with a
single.

Grinnell backed Nissen with
a double—play in the fourth, but
managed to get only two hits,
both by Dick Crowl. Grinnell
now has a 5-4 record and is
placed third in their conference

division,

,Pioneers Split Galesburg Games

The Pioneers split a double—header last weekend in
Galesburg against Monmouth and Knox.

The first game was played Saturday morning against
Monmouth and Grinnell won it 5-4. Tile Pioneers backed up
a fine pitching performance by Dick Growl who allowed six
]hits and gave up only 3 earned runs. Crow] struck out 10

THE M
TABULATOR

The rains came, so this week's
games have been canceled or
postponed. Only one game ‘was
played and a shower delayed
that for 15 minutes.

Cowles beat Gates, 3.2. By
virtue or their defeat, Gates
dropped into third place and
Cowles remained in ﬁrst Ex-
cept ior Gates, the standings
are the same as last week.

The golf meet was finally held

Wednesday, and although the
greens were very slow, the
scores were very good. Smith
copped the title with an 85,
stroke average.

Then came Dibble, Cowles,
Clark, Gates and North, all
ﬁnishing in that order. Raw<
sou, South and Langan failed
to have enough to gain en<
trance points.

Bud Hulse from Smith led the
ﬁeld with a 79. He was pushed
by‘ teammates Nietzel and De-
Long, who had an an and ill
respectively. Locked in fourth
were Rufer of Dibble and Paul-
ey of Smith. They both ﬁnished
with 83’s.

The Kent trophy race has
narrowed to two halls, North
and Cowles. Cowles is leading
with a total ‘Scnre of 2000.
North is 120 points back with
1880i CDWIES can do no worse
than lie, and in order to be
tied must lose their remain—
ing three softball games and
‘ North must Win all of theirsa
t The game next week between
t North and Cowlns should be
‘ a real thriller.

In the next issue I’ll have
[the ﬁnal standings in soitbail
'and the trophyiunless it rains
again.
