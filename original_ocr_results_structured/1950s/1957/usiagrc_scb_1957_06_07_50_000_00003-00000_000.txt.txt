Thorn‘l'on Evahia’res Oul’come

Of Graduaie Record Tes’ring

Givens L. Thornton, reg15-
tl‘al‘, expressed the opinion
of the faculty and adminis-
tration when he said that,
“We were extremely well
pleased with the performance

of the'seniors on the insti-
tutional testing program of
Graduate Record exams".

All the scores from these
exams were computed and
their 'percentile equivalent
on'a national norm was deter-
mined. An overall picture show.
ed that the average Grinnell
student ranked in the 73th per-
centi

and over hall of the depanmenls
were above the 85th percentile.

Tho results oi the testing
program were discussed and
cvaiunted at a faculty meet—
ing. Departmental representa-
ﬁves pointed out the inade-
quacles oi the tests in their
areas and many expressed the
desire to cstahlish particular
norms lor Grinnell in order
to compare inturc graduating
classes.

Thornton explained the results
or the tests when he stated that,
“It must he clearly understood
that our attempt to evaluate de-
partments-on a hasis of perfore

. in addition to this, everyr
,depa‘rtment was,ahove the 60th
'percelitile' on national‘ norms,

marlce of thelr major students

is not meaningful. There are two
reasons for this caution.

"First, test areas are nut
equivalent as to level of diffi»
culty.

“Second, and more important,
the exams do not cover the sub-
ject matter of the various de-
partments to the same extent.”

Fifteen areas took mduate
record exams, tests not being_
avallnhle for other depart-
ments. Their approximate av-
erage percentiles were as fol-'
lows:

Biology. 71; chemistry, 87,
economics, as; education, 89;
French-Spanish, 63; government,
66; history, 88; literature, 60;
mathematics.’ 72; music, 3’];
philosophy. 73; psychology, 92;
physics, 7; sociology,. 94; and
speech, 64. ' »
_According to Thornton, “Fur-
ther evidence of the high cali-
ber of our seniors can be noted
in as much as in la departments,
one or more students scored
above the 95th percentile. with
the majority of them rating
above the 99th percentile."

The Graduate Record exams
were last given in 1952, and
discontinued at that tilde he-
oauso of financial reasons.
Since 'that time they have
been changed considerably.
The profile (est. covering dil-
ferent areas of study have
been discontinued nndthe tests
are now set up in three dil-
ferent partsi There is the
school aptitude test, the area
test (naturar and social
sciences and humanities)~ and
the advanced or Graduate
Record exams, which Grinneli
participates in.

TlO- .admin .iration is looking
ahead now to the addition of the
areas test in order to assess the
broad Outcome of the liberal arts
education. If this is done, it will
probably increase the testing
program to two days.

WE WISH
TH‘E SENIORS
SUCCESS
AND
HAPPINESS
IN THEIR
CAREERS.
