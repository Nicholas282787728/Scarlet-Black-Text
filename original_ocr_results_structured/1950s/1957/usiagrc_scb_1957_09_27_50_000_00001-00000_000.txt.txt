Library Plans Set;
Site Made Known

With the approval of the
essential plan for the new
library by the executive com-
mittee of the Board of Trus-
tees on September 19, def<
inite building plans are now
moving forward.

Curtis E. Bradford, chairman
of the library planning commit.
tee, reviewed the progress made
during the summer and stated
that President Howard B. Bow—
en hopes to break ground for
the building next spring.

Site Named by Trustees

The site of the Ibuilding, which
was decided by the trustees in
June, is in the general area of
the present music building. The
north side of the lSS-foot square
building will he on a line with
Blair hall steps,

Principal designer of the li-
brary Walter A. Notch, who
also designed the controver-
sial United states Air Force
Academy chapel, was present
at the preliminary design con.
ference July 12.13, Consultant
Keyes n. Metcalf, librarian
emeritus of Harvard univer-
sity, and assistant designer
Thomas Klausmcyer were also
present.

The approved scheme for the
library includes glass walls on
the north and south and light
gray brick walls on the east
and west. “In the original
scheme, all four walls were
glass,” stated Bradford, “but the
second scheme was accepted
mainly because it was $200,000
cheaper

Three Level Building

The library will be on three
levels, a terrace or English base-
ment level, the main level, which
will be three feet above the
campus grade, and a mezzanine.
The entrance will be on the
north.

A new feature of the plans is
an administration center on the
terrace level. This would pro-
vide space for the offices now
housed in the Administration
building, plus the offices of ad-
missions and possibly those of
alumni and development.

“The ultimate plan includes
space for 309,000 hooks and
550 readers," Bradford said.

Guggenheim Show
By Seven Art ‘l“l’lS s
Displayed In Main

Paintings from the S010-
mon R. Guggenheim museum,
New York, are now on dis-
play in Main hall foyer.
These paintings, including
Gleizes,
Hartley, Kandinsky, Klee,
Marc and Xcel‘on, will re-
main here until February 28.

This is one of sixteen groups
of paintings which the museum
is lending for an extended pe-
riod to educational institutions
throughout the United States.
It is the hope of the Guggen—
heim foundation that by extend.
ing the length of the loan pe-
riod, schools will be given an
opportunity to build their own
exhibits, using pictures from the
Guggenheim collection as a nu-
cleus. The foundation also feels
that a longer loan period will
have more educational value to
the borrowing institutions by
giving viewers a greater oppor-
tunity to familiarize themselves
with the works shown.

Care has been taken to dis—
tribute the paintings geograph-
ically to points where this type
of work is not commonly avail-
able.

This display will be featured
during ‘the special Convocation
and the art department hopes
at that time also to present
work in progress by this year's
art students.

Lack Of Ideals;

Cites Study Of Students? Values

“Idealism is the very essence of Grinnell college. The
ideal at Grinnell has never been merely to educate young
people so that they could get ahead in the world as it is.
The ideal has been to give these young people the equip—
ment, and the will, to help make this a better world."

Fall "Act I"
Features Hey

The orchestra of Don Hoy
will play for the 1957 version
of the annual fall formal t.
evening of Oct. 5 in Darby gym.
Paul Has: and his Gadabouts
are in nargc of the dance, the
first major college social event
of the year.

The dance, titled ”Act I," will

use antique theatrical posters,
a dance floor centerpiece, and
a lighted backdrop as decorae
Iions to contribute to the dra-
matic air of the occasion. The
decor will be accented by the
gym ceiling- which resembles
the “ﬁles” of a theatre.

The semielormal affair, a non-
ilower dance, will last until 12
midnight.

This was the theme of “Stu-
dents and Their Ideals,” a talk
by President Howard R. Bowen
in the first chapel service of

the academic year last Wednes-
day. It introduced the fall

chapel series, which will be ens
titled “Ideals in Action."
“Cultural Rubber Stamps"

“'1! anything the “typical”
college graduate is a cultural
rubber stamp for the social heri—
tage as it stands rather than
the instigator of new patterns
of thought and new standards

. DI Conduct'," Bowen said in quo-

ting Philip E. Jacobs’ “Changing
Values in College.” ”The grad—
uate’s essential goal is a con-‘
tented family life in a splits
level suburban house, with a
station wagon, three kids, long
weekends and early retirement.”

The talk summarized several
recent studies of the values and
aspirations of American college
students. “The studies depict
students as solfecentered, con.
formist, and concerned almost
exclusively' about the personal
comfort of themselves and their
immediate families. They have
apparently adopted what I
should call ‘the creed of per-
sonal comfort; This seems a far
cry from what we usually think
of as idealism," President Bowen
said.

The values of American col<
Iegc students are remarkably
