To the Editor,

What's happened to the pic-
ture»laking schedule for the Cyr
clone? Many pictures remain to
be taken, yet hardly any pic-
tures have been taken in,the
past two months, As a senior I
am especially anxious to have
a complete yearbook this year,
and it appears to me that at this
rate many important pictures
will not be taken.

Is there a schedule set up
for the taking of these pio-
tures in the remaining three
weeks oi school? Even with
a schedule it could be a tight
business to get them all in,
and if nothing is planned the
result could be a sadly incom-
plete annual. ,

Am I being overly pessimiSr
tic? In my own case, pictures of
four groups which I am in have

not yet been taken, including
the hall picture. And many other
people I have talked to‘ about
this problem report much the
same situation.

Mr. Wellhouse is quite wor-
ried about this situation him-
self. no said last week that
he had been trying to find out
for some time what had hapr
pened to the picture schedule,
but nobody seemed to know.
He even considered scheduling
pictures himself,'but didn’t feel
it was his place to do that.
without question the Cyclone
is going to be quite late this
year, but that isn’t my main con-
cern. I Just want to be sure we
have one that we can be proud
of and look back on in later
years without wondering what
happened to the other half of it.

Commiiiee Offers Lake Acre
For Off-Campus Social Life

By Cathy Foster .

“Spring is sprung, the grass is l‘iz . . r

and now is

the time to enjoy the endless possibilities of fun that Lake
Acre has to offer: hiking, camping, canoeing, picnicking—
all for a quick call to Tom Bailey, chairman of the Off—Cam—

pus social committee.

Lake Acre was founded by
Irv Simone (men's physical edr
ucotion) four years ago with
the purchase of one acre of land
on Rock Creek lake. A cabin

«owned. by Women’s Honor G
« was moved to this location and

Simone had two bunk houses
built as an improvement.

Recently a second acre was
bought and this, with the
state-owned land to‘ the east
and South, provides all the
land even the most experieuc~
ed Camper could Want. But

, THE mirth

Lake Acre is still to he im-
proved. This summer a well
with :1 pressurized Water sys-

tem will be put in and four
picnic areas are being plan<
nod for the extreme corners of
the property.

The purpose of Tom's commit-
tee is to encourage you to use
Lake Acre and to help you
make the necessary arrange~
incnts. The cabin, which will
sleep sixteen, may be reserved
by any student or faculty mem-
ber at any time that doesn't
conflict with an all—college
event.

If you can't obtain private
transportation, call Ralph Ram-
bow (director of student em-
ployment) who will reserve
one of the college station wag-
ons for your The cost is very
little (50¢ per person for over
night) for the great time you’ll
have.

So while planning your trip,
first call Tom, at least a week
in advance, at his Union office
between 4:30 and 5:30 Monday
through Friday. Be sure you
have authorized transportation
and a qualified chaperone, If
spending the night, check out
sheeting from the office and
take plenty of food~ther€s a
refrigerator and gauge. Don't:
take books, forget all the work
waiting for you, and have 3 won-
derful time!
