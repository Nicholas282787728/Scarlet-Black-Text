Sticks
and
Stones

By Paul ﬂoss
More than a week ago, just
after i returned to school, 1 was
,privileged to witness an act so
gross that it still bears recount
ing. The scene or the crime,
quite naturally, was Cowles din—
ing room: an upperclassman,
having eaten as much of his
dessert as he could with a fork
(and he seemed none too skilled
in using it), took his plate up
in both hands and proceeded to
lick it clean.

It was wolilsh and harhoric,
and it turned my stomach;
yet it did not seem quite
worthy oi an entire column
until last Sunday night, when
the administration slapped an
embargo on shipments oi food
to the halls, sending 500-odd
nien howling into the dining
room, there to wallow around
the food tahles in monstrous
parody of an insane asylum
picnic.

The practice of serving food
in the hall lnunges had its
faults, for a fact; the sight of
ashtrays clogged with apple
cores and ﬁreplaces ‘banked with
half-eaten sandwiches was not
a pretty one, and the inherent
o'aﬁshness of Grinnell manhaod
was never more evident than
when he shaved and snarled his
way into the peanut butter bowl.
A ﬁlm of the vulgarity would
have complemented “The Silver
Dollar Story" rather nicely.

But there were advantages:
when barbarism ran too ram-
pant, you could always retire
with your iood, or, at the

. . a group oi Congregationalists rounded Grinnell college.
it was, of course, iounded as a Christian college with the appro-
priate courses to teach the students the precepts oi the christian
tradition. .

Today, listed under thc requirements for graduation in the
college bulletin, is the word “Religion." This requirement (which
is a Christianity and not a religious requirement) can he met by
taking one oi iour courses. Two of the courses deal with the Bible,
one with Christian thought and the other with problems in col-ls
temporary religion.

“Religion” requirement and give it that name, the “powers that
lie” should re-evaluate the eourses they ofier. This is one place
where the ivy is not merely ascending up the hoary walls, but is
stifling any progress The whole philosophy oi the courses seems
that oi “what was good enough ior grandpaw is good enough ior
me...

With technological advancements oi this century the world is in-
creasingly becoming a large neighborhood with conilicting cul-
tures, philosophies and religions. The “Religion" requirements at
Grinneil, with readjustments, can oiier an invaluable opportunity
to become acquainted with the religions oi the world, point out
similarities and diiierences, and iinally, make an attempt to icrrn
a basis of understanding between different peoples and their re»
ligions. The present courses, centered on the Christian tradition, do
not iulfill what we think to be the function of a liheral “Religion"
requirement.

A word of advice to prospective writers oi letters to the edi-
tor—the Scarlet and Black cannot assume the responsibility of
printing such letters unless we hold a signed copy. Names may he
withheld—at the editor’s discretion—but no letter submitted an-
nonymously will ever be printed.

Last Sunday there was no es-

years teaching and writing about local government, decided

more

about what politics is than in all the literature I've

read," he said ill a recent interview.

ln those three months Gilmour

has been campaigning as the
Democratic candidate ior state
senator from Poweshiek and

Gilmour is waging his cam-

n1i i am going to represent
the people, I ought to know
what the people think.” And
by now, he should.

He has traveled over 5,000
miles, mostly on country roads.
He has talked with businessmen,

Gilmour has written letters to
