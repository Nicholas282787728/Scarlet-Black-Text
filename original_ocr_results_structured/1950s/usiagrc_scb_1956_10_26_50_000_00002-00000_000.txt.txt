Class Elections

Class elections this year demonstrated more spirit than

we have seen in elections in the past three years. There
were so many posters that it was impossible to see a vacant
tree, empty wall space in ARH halls, or the entrance to the
Union, There seemed to be a record number of candidates
running.

We hope that it wasn’t the prestige of holding a campus
office which prompted so many people to run, but rather a
sincere interest in student government and campus affair ‘.
If this is the case, we hope that the defeated candidates '1“
continue to show enthusiasm and a willingness to work in
campus government.

This can be done by attending student council meetings
as an interested student, and volunteering service to campus
organizations. Contributing suggestions to the newly elect-
ed class officers for strengthening the functions of the
classes is another important area of sel'Vlcc. There is a
definite problem of what the class officers can do besides
holding a party and being a representative at Student Coun—

cil meetings

‘ Capilu/ Commenfary

By Tom Skornia and
Lynn Parsons

'This Week we release results
of the nation-wide Skornia-Parr
sons Public Opinion Poll in Re»
gard to Congress. We have been
93.5% right in the past. (8% of
the time.) Thousands of devol-
ed workers have cabled these
findings to us in regard to the
Senate campaigns:

SAFE REPUBLICAN: Kan-
535, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Connecticut“ colorado, Idaho,
Indiana, Norfh and South Da-
kota, Iowa, Utah and Wiscon-
sin. SAFE DEMOCRATIC:
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
North Carolina, South Caro-
lina (2), Oklahoma, Missouri,
Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
West Virginia and Washington
This gives the cor 12 out of
use 35 seats contested, and the
Democrats 16. 0f the seven
remaining, here are our com-
menis:

Kentucky: Two contests, with
a probable split. Democratic inc
cumbent Clements will be rc-
turned, but the late Alben Bark-
ley’s seat will be filled by GOP
ex—Senator John 5. Cooper.
Cooper’s opponent, ex-Governor
Lawrence Wetherby, has earned
the hatred of “Happy" Chan-
dler, and due to the iatter's
lack of interest in the outcome
of the whole election will lose
the seat to the GOP. .

Maryland: Right next door
is the hottest fight of all. Re-
publican John M. Butler is
fighting a desperate battle for

his political life against George
P. Mahoney, Baltimore con-
traction Butler is haunted by
the questionable campaign he
conducted with the aid of Joe
McCarthy for the office in '50,
and admits parts of it were in
“bad taste.“ He'll loser

New York: This is closest of
all. However, due to lack of in
terest by the Tammany machine
in Democratic Mayor Wagner’s
candidacy, and Harriman’s 4000
vote gubernatorial margin in ’54,
this will likely go to the popu—
lar state attorney general, Jacob
Javils, who defeated FDR. Jr.
for the post.

California, pretty much writ-
ten off by the Democrats earli-
er, but now showing promising
signs clue to extensive organiza-
tion work, givcs promise of
electing Richards over Kuchel,

interim holder of the Vacancyr

lef_t when Nixon became Veep.

Oregon, which the soy has
gone all out to get in settling

its grudge fight with Wayne i

Morse, looks safely in the
Democratic column Nov. 6
despite frantic White House
efforts, including the sacrifice
of a Secretary of the Interior
and extra campaign trips into
the state

Pennsylvania: Clark will up—
set the incumbent Duff. Renovac
tion of the Democratic party
machinery, completed by James
Finnegan before his accession to
running the Stevenson campaign,
gives great hopes in this ever

Sackclolh
And

Ashes

By Gene Thompson

One of the things I’ve always
missed at Grinncll is the satis-
fying pastime of rniding the ice-
box for a sandwich and a glass
of milk. I’ve often dreamed
<whilc eating dry roast beef
and uncooked stringbeans) of
the handy refrigerator at home,
fillcd with all the goodics for
making a sandwich.

And now the Foods depart-
ment has come as closc as
possible, it seems, to the meal ,
of my dreams, The menu! for
the new Sunday night snacks
that are brought to the hall
is the best one 1 have seen
yet _ sandwiches and milk,
made all the hatter by the
practice (almost unheardcof
until now) of providing fresh
bread with a meal.

Many thanks are due for this

“There be some sports are

Delight in them sets off."

And Edmund Sponsor, English
poet of the loin century, with
his impressions of Blair hall:

“It was a goodly heap for
to behold,

And spake the praises of
the workman’s wit;

But full great pity, that so
fair a mold

Did on so weak foundation
ever sit . . . .

And all the binder parts,
that few could spy,

Were ruinous and old, but
painted cunningly.”

Counci/ Corner

By Art Travers
Thursday night we held per—
haps the longest council meet-
ing in years. For my money, if
was also one of the most prof-
itahle.

in the first place we had an
astounding turnout of interested
students, even if we disregard
the North preps who were
rather a captive audience.

Secondly, Mr. Norris Neveln
presented the answers to many

could actually be a band from
Waterloo, led by a guy named
Joe Donkes . . . But that’s fan—

tastic , . f

student questions It is this sort
of thing which may really clear
up some 0 the fog ensconcing
certain depa tments.

‘The Student Council seems to
be moving now, and moving in
the right direction. It would
serve no purpose to list the
other areas in which we intend
to work between now and
March. I don’t want anyone to
take my bare word for it any-
way.

My suggestion is to watch the
council in the coming weeks. If
things continue in this vein we
ought to deliver the results.
