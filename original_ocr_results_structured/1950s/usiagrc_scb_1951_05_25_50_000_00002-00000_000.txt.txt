Cyclone Hits Campus

This week hundreds of Grinnellians suddenly scurried
for the protective shelter of the student Union, Amidst the
anxious cries of young men and women, the Cyclone had
arrived. At‘exactly 2:30 p. m. on Wednesday, long lines of
students began to form; women from all over the campus
gathered their friends and valuables and huddled in their
scant clothing over warm coffee, greatly on edge over the
unexpected arrival of the Cyclone.

Meanwhile, the Cyclone spread and raged all over the
Campus, ruining all posslhii'ies 01’ study and disrupting
much of the week’s activities. Clear thinking along with
quick action on the part of certain students must be coin-
mended in preventing the initial shock of the Cyclone's are
rival from getting out of hand.

We have been told from reliable forecasters that in the
future all Cyclones will arrive on campus well before gl'a‘d:
nation time, Another new twist will also be added: each
Cyclone \lill represent an accumulation of events from
March of one year to March of the next. ’

To the Editor “

I would like to write a roplyl
to the letter written last week
by Will Horn and Dave Theo—
philus. I feel that some of their
criticisms need more qualificar
tion.

In response to their first point
I would agree with them that
it would be nice to have judg-
es from other colleges than
Grinnell. This, however, would
be a Very expensive proposition.
1 would also like to know how
that they feel the Judging wasl
binsgn. Did they feel that the
judges were prejudiced in their
decisions or is it just a case
or “sour grapes." Four of the
judges have had a very firm
background in music and I
think that when you have five
judges that it is quite difﬁcult,
to have the element of preju-l
dlce affect the total decision.

The purpose of the public ad-
dress system is to make the
announcements only. If there
was any difficulty in hearlng
these announcements and you
believe that the public address‘
system is faulty this condition
should be brought to the atten»
tion of Building and Grounds.

This year we had more chairs
than usual and I agree that
there were still people without
chairs. Next year’s chairman
will probably rectify this error.

There were two overhead

lStudent Council

 

spotlights shining on the steps
and the people in the audience
had no trouble seeing the con-
test. In what way do you
think that the lighting could be
improved?

In section 3b of the rules for
the 195l Fetzer Sing there is.
this statement ”Soloists, quar-
tets, or other similar small‘
groups may he used In only
one number with a choir back
ground.” This point was

also l

on their ballot sheet. This rulel
was In’ the hands of all of the
hall music Chairmen and if thisl

question arose they should have;

consulted their rules. i

I hope that this letter Wllll
clear up any misunderstanding;
that arose from the contest and‘
I hope that next year’s con~
test will he more successful
than this year’s. 1

In a report to
Council yesterday on

Cole remalked “The conleicnco
was poolly iun and seemed.
thrown together in a hurry.” Thel
Student Council will decide next‘
fall whether or not Grinnclll
should stay in NSA (

Shilley Klnney in connecticnl
with the discussion added, “Next
year we should be careful not
to send too many people to Cons
tersnccs, Enrollment ivill bcl
down and the money might well‘
be spent somewhere else." l,

Antonia Carst has been try.
ing to find out it it would bel
possible for Grinncll to get a
Negro exchange professor, Dr,
Samuel Stevens tools the trus—
tees would be more likely to
favor giving a year’s scholarship
to a Negro graduate to teach at
Grinnell.

The student investigating comu

at the leaders: conference this
summer. Revisions ot the Slur
dent Council constitution which
they have suggested will he
