'White Elephant' Becomes Valuable:

Lake Acre Altered

by Ernie Gershon

By Improvements

Things have happened lately at Lake Acre!

Early this fall 2t group of students decided to have a
look at the place which had aroused so much interest on
campus during the past year 7 Lake Acre. Bob Holmes
volunteered his car, and with him went Dick Lehrer oi'
KGRW, 5&3 reporter Dick Peterson, photographer Hod

Greeley, and myself,

We began to wonder about
the feasibility of ever making
use of Lake Acre when we got
our first sight or the cabin near
the gale leading in irom the
road. We became cvcn more
convinced when we saw the
surrounding area The question
of what wc could possibly do
With this "white elEph’dnt" was
in all our minds when we left.

Innovations

We didn’t print what we
thought or it at the time, how»
ever, and were extremely glad
or it shortly after, when we
began to see some changes be-
ing made on the site. in the

_ short pcriod or time since Gary
Hayes was appointed chairman
ot thc now Off-Campus Re-
creational committee, composed
at Jan Wciithc, Jean Tiedeman,
Bill Moorcs, Jim Katcher, and
Judy Graves, much has been
accomplished.

Both the land and the mov—
ing of the cabin (donated by
the Women‘s Honor G) have
been paid tor. Just this month
a ﬁreplace was built tor the
cabin. A new root has been
added along with a ioothridge.
.parking area, better lighting
rixtures and outlets and two
tlood lights to illuminate the
outdoor cooking areas. Paint
was bought tor the cabin but
«york was brought to a halt by
the recent snow.

i Studcnt Help

Talking to Gary i found out
that students can hclp with
Lake Acre during the second
semester in two ways. "Fl t.”
he said, “it would help a gieat
deal it studcnts would ircely
give their time when asked to
do so, and add their skills and
labor to the protect.

"Even more important, they

can roster growth oi Lake
Acre by taking the i ative

in planning their own social
activities out at the cabin,
Anyone who gnes to enough
trouble to plan a party out
there will be given all the
help he needs by our com-
mitten"

Concerning transportation, he
said that arrangements can be
made to transport all groups
wishing to use Lake Acre,
either by taxi or a church bus.
The cost of the bus, is more
than
per person. The taxi is $4 a
round trip. That is, it will take
you there and then pick you up
the same day or the tollowing
clay

All trips to Lake Acre should
be cleared with the‘Ofi-Campus
Recreation committee before
hand.

Tobogganing

Gary also stated that winter
would not stop activities ztt

snow. the buildings and grounds

boggan slidc on Sugar Creek
Hill, about three miles trom

also excellent toboganing
around Lake Acrc itscli. In ad»
dition, skating will soon be pelts
mitted on Rock Creek Lakc, and
the cabin can bc opened as a
home base for skatcrs.

Until it was turned over to
students this year, practically
