four proposals for campus liter-
ght to light. The first was
ngs and Bob

During;r the past week
ary magazines have been brou
“The Maverick” suggested by Charlie Hasti
Dickinson. The Seco
llllal. Similar to thi
annual. The fourth idea is a quarterly literary supp
to the S&B, also suggested by Haynes.

It is a healthy Sign that three separate groups are
concerned about an outlet for creative writing, and each
suggestion has much that is good in it

”The Maverick” would offer a large variety of material
at a very low cost to the student. The SDX annual and the
annual proposed by Haynes wou
year‘s work, be pleasing to the eye, and would last. The
S&B literary supplement would require no cash expendi-
tures from students, would reach all the students and so
would pave the way for the regular publication of a slick
magazine in the next yeztr.

But each of these ideas, too, has its disadvantage. “The
Maverick” and the S&B supplement would most likely be
thrown away, lost, or be in bad shape by the end of a
school yearl The annual would have to be bought blind,
anld in View of Arena’s failure we’re all likely to be skepti—
ca.

Why not merge the two fundamental ideas? An S&B
literary supplement published quarterly and climaxed by
the publication of an annual containing its material plus

_ new material would combine the advantages of both pr

‘ posals, This way the student body would be provided with
a literary publication four times during the school year,
and it would also have a permanent and attractive record of
this material plus the added dividend of new material at
the end of the year. We would know before hand if we were
getting our money‘s worth and would probably get a divi-
dend in the form of new, unpublished material.

The publication of the annual could await campus re-
action to the material printed in the supplement. If campus
opinion was favorable, the annual would be printed; If not,
nothing would be lost. Grinnell would have maintained its
literary publication.

There are other embryos
around which might look more
attractive than a frantic
monthly mimeograph. Sigma
Delta Chi (you may have
heard of it; the authorities
try to keep the fact under
cover, but it’s a fraternity) is
thinking of risking a mag-

Perhaps if it gestatcs into
reality, public demand might
give it a hard time. I still
maintain, however, that a lot
of interesting humor can be
found in eighbpagers, and that
a good publication could be pro-
duced here in fairly good taste
and still satisfy people. And of
top quality.

The idea snx has, among
,others, is a sort of omnibus of
lgood work over the year; things
that a budding scribblcr wouldn‘t
mind seeing in print, and that
others wouldn’t mind spending a
little cash for.

‘ It’s worth mentioning as an
alternative to stray oattlc. if

the theorizing stage, it might
be a step beyond, instead of
a substitute for, thc dcccascd

One astute observer said af-
terward that Welch was pro -
ably the only poison living
who could stand before us, say i
the things he did, and not be
lrughod out of town. It's
probably true. We’ve been
conditioned to growing tired

the same speech.
