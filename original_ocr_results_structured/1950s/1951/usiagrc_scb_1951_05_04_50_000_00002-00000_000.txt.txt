Just a Minute, Now...

Sometimes we go along with things with which we dis-
agree only to keep the peacegno rhyme nor reason. And
then we come to the point that. something has to be said.

We‘re at that point now. For the past eight weeks since
what Mr. Stevens called “The Monday Night Incident” we
have been in the period which we can call ,“The Great In»
trospection." Groups of students are giving up consider»
able time and effort recommending areas for revamping in
all phases of student life ’ ' .

Area of Work

This revamping includes clarification of our trouble-
some rules such as the girls’ drinking rule, the rule' on elig-
ibility fo' major campus officespand others Here we feel
that pos ive good is being accomplished and may be accoms
plished. It is the area in which our student government
was designed to work and can work effectively.

The Student Council is carrying on some introspection
of its own at the same time. Its investigation is not in the
area of rules and regulations, but in the 'general operation
of the college. Spurred by a possible'r 'se‘in fees, the Colin-
cil has been looking into ways of saying college and stil-
dent money. Recommendations -have included the use of
bachelor teachers as “hous’emothers” on North campus, the
increased use of students as maintenance personnel, and the
making of bookstore and Union manager ’ 5 student jobs.

If we aren’t dependable enough to showlup for our jobs

when we‘re hired to work in the Union, ,to type in an Office,
or to work in the library, how can we expect to, operate
them? ‘ , ",
If we can’t work more than an. hour at,a time, those
squeezed in between classes, how.‘ can we» carry a bucket
and paint brush across campus,‘ ready the equipment, work,
put it away, and carry it back—and consider it an hour
well»spent from the college point of view‘.7 And if in the
meantime a teacher needs a brief, conference after class, or
a quick coffee seems to be in order before Wdl‘kitllzlt hour
is perhaps one-fourth gone. - ’

It’s true that we have the ability to do much of \the
work that needs doing, but do we have the inclination?

Proof of the Pudding .

The publicity office has recently published a booklet
”The Proof of the Pudding.” It‘ shows what some recent
Grinnell graduates were able ,to do with their education
here. If the proof of that pudding‘ has been in the eating,
so will be the proof of this. ,- ._ .
' While we’re deep in probing into the private affairs of
this institution, we must probe as deeply into our own. If
we are not willing to take on all the responsibility we are
constantly clamoring for, we must hush.

Now we’re in a sort of proving period. While the Stu-
dent Council ahd the investigatin‘ commission continue
their efforts, we will make them worthless if we don’t prove
we can handle whatever we ask for, whether it is increased
student government or increased employment.

At the “mass-meetings" called ,by the commission, some
80 persons at most have appeared. Three hundred were 111}

resolved in work. Some people will point an accusing finger
at the editors and say this editorial has been “administra-

Student Commandments

Submitted by \‘Vinston L. King, dean of the chapel, after publica-
tion of “Commandments for Profs.”

These things, so help me, I have seen with my own
eyes:

If Thou shalt not come to class with a head empty of
ideas, a mind devoid of interest, and a manner lacking in
courtesy. ' ,

2. Thou shalt remind thyself, at least once a month,
that one of the minor purposes of thy presence in Grinnell
is to study.

3 Thou shalt not be so rude as to carry on a conver-
sation with thy.neighbor during the class hour, nor so

corner of thy mouth.

4. Thou shalt not seek to fob off thy instructor with
whiskery old excuses for sloppy work, nor with other stu-
dents’ last year’s papers in place of thine own.

5. Thou shalt not groan in mortal agony when thy
professor asks thee to rise above the level of a well-trained
parrot and do a spot of genuine thinking. ‘

6. Thou shalt provide thyself with toothpicks to keep
thine eyelids apart in class the morning after the night be-
fore, and not gurgle so loudly in thy slumbers as to disturb
others in theirs.

’7. Thou shalt not close thy notebook, and button up
thy mind like a deepfreezc, more than 10 minutes before
the close of the class.

8. Thou shalt not spring for the door at the end of
class in attempt to set a new 100-meter record. '

9. .Thou shalt not hold thy beloved’s hand in the cor-
ridor nor chin with thy gang until the bell has rung, thus
using the first five minutes of class time to get seated.‘«

10. Thou shalt use the campus sidewalksat least once
a day during the mud season and not clean thy boots on
class room chairs and office rugs. '

Going dociasses every day ism the only way to get a college

Pctersonpsenior speech correction majors, Their academic pros
grams incluclc' cburscs in speech correction, psycholcgy, sdciology,
and biological science; individual case work. work in Grinnell pub
lic schools; ai'ld remedial speech work.

This major field is one of the
most specialized curriculums at
Grinnell, but‘ as Jack and John
pointed cui.‘ iany students do‘
not specialize in this work our
til graduate school. “The pur-
pose of .ispeech ,cori‘ecuon at
orinhcll:r explained John, “is to
give u general background in
the field~which should be ex.
tended further with graduate
school work”, ._

'Clinic Work

Jack includes students cf both

and Jphn meet with these stu-
dents three ’clmcs a week for
fifteen i’niuutes to walk with the
specific speech difficulty.

“High schdol students are not
included 'in this work”, pointed
oui Jack, .“because the program
is designed to catch stmlents in
the Grinnell school system with
speech defects before they reach
high school age. Cases at col-
lege here‘are those, who have

Fuller Announces
Two-Hour Course

In ROTC Science

Mr. Max E. Fuller, dean of the
college, has announced ihe
course of instruction in Air
ROTC beginning next Septem-
ber. There will be a first and

second year program, Mr. Fuller
said.

All- Science I, is the name of

the freshman course, It will be
a two semester hour course and
will meet twice a week. The
course will be continuous
through both semesters.

“Frimary function of the
course will be to provide gcncre
3] knowledge of geopolitics.” the
dean said. Certain features of air
transportation, population and
lpolitical‘behavior will be dealt
with during the first year,

Air Science ll, lhe sophomore
course, will deal with ”Air Paws
er Concepts," which will be giv-
cn in six subdivisions, They will
deal with maps and aerial photo-
graphy, aerial navigation, mete-
orology, aerial dynamics and
propulsion, applied air power,
and a final section called “The
Study of the Basic Organization.
31 structure for the Defense of
the United States." This last
section will comprise a siudy of
the defense department organi-
zation down to the smallest
unit, according to Mr. Fuller.
,ln addition to the twoshour
course ‘ of Class instruction,
freshmen and sophomores will
spend about one hour per week
doing field work. This will in-
clude drill,'exei-cise in command,
and the study of weapons.

Only selected students will be
admitted to the junim‘ and sen-
iDI‘ program upon successful
completion of Air Science ll.
These upperclassmen will be able
lo choose one from among a
number of courses of lnsirllc-
tion.

“We don‘t know yet which of
these courses will be offered,“
Mr. Fuller said, “but three of
the possibilities are administra—
tlon and logistics, comptroller--
ship. and communications.”

“I know that the men will
have a number of questions
about this program which are
still unanswered,” the dean said.
He added that a representative
of ihc Air Force will be coming
to Grinnell within the next few
weeks to answer questions.

‘The Daily Kansan carried a
story about an entomology pro-
fessor who walked into class
with a large brown sack under
his arm. Before revealing its
contents he told puzzled stu-
dents, “When a dog bites a man,
it’s a little unusual, but when a
teacher brings apples to his
students—that’s news.”
