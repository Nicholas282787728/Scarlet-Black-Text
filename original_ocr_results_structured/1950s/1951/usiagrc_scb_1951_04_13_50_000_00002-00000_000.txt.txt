New Dining Policy
‘On Dress, Conduct

The Council at House Presi-
dents published and distributed
its new dining room policy this
week At supper, Wednesday
evening, each man received a
copy of this policy which goes
. into effect as of that date

Rules for the dining room
have been divided int two cat.
egories: those conc ing dress,
and those dealing with conduct.
,A graduated scale of fines and
lpenaltics has been lormulatedl
lwhich increases with the he,
quency and seriousness of often—,
ses by the individual. For ex—
,ample, a fine not exceeding a,
ldollar will be levied against the
student for his first violation of
rules concerning dress; his seer,

 

 

 

Faculty Dismissal

Professors haven’t been “given the boot
left" as we‘ve heard noised over the coffee cups in the
Union. Neither will the i ‘ulty be identical ill size and per-
sonnel to this year’s. Here is the plan outlined by Presi»
dent Stevens for the student’s clarification.

The smallest high school class in years will graduate
this year. These students were depressionvborn babies. They
will graduate into uncertain conditions of national defense
~thus far unstahilized draft policy, competition of blg-
money defense industries, and the idea of going into ser-
vice to get it over. Coupled with these facts and theories,
is the additional fact that applications to Grinnell, as at
other colleges, are running at only about 507; of the usual
number, these nearly twoethirds girls.

The maintenance of the college buildings will cost as
much lvith a decreased number of students as with the
present number. Inflation has and will increase food and
other costs. Meantime, for every 100 students not enrolled
$127,000 is knocked out of the budget. This is made up in
gifts and in saving expenses.

Not wanting to cut faculty salaries at a time of rising
prices, the administration must take the other alternative
icut the number of teachers on the payroll. lnorder to
continue to offer as wide a variety of courses as the pres
ent curriculum does, teachers have been asked to carry one
additional fourvhour course each year. Then a sifting pro»
cess was begun to determine which faculty members would
be dismissed.

A list was compiled of the faculty members working
on annual contracts and those whose contracts would ex
pire at the end of this academic vear. Another list was made
of teachers possessing skills which would enable them to
find work the most easily in fields other than teaching. A
further list was made of the courses most popular the last
time the college student population was more than half
women. ‘

Although many believ
such as ”last to come in, first to go out,"

    

 

 

d that pat formulas were used,

Mr. Stevens report»- to the S & B that little dissatisfaction
from the faculty has been brought to his attention.

In order to keep the present ratio of appro imately 10
students to each faculty member, the faculty will have to
be dismissed in proportion to enrollment. By May 1 this
year, the facility members not now on permanentvtenurc
basis will be notified definitely.

Ah, Printemps.’

The apples haven’t rotted fast enough this year. Or
the lists haven’t grown with their usual spring—time spurt.
Nothing‘s happening. Even the flowers are afraid to bloom
to say nothing of the blankets.

We have combed our co

phere has been severely and‘permanently disturbed by atolnic
explosions. Others say it‘s sunspots. Others think that a new
cycle of seasons is naturally gravitating toward later months
in our calendar year.

But at Grinnell we knowispring cannot officially be-
gin until we have had our convocation speech. We‘d never
thought we’d see the day, but now we’re asking, “Please,
Mr. Stevens, please!”

To the Editors:

Last July 28, the United Na,

tions passed a bill making it
possible for civic groups, seeu.
lar and religious institutions,
and schools to display the Unit
ed Nations flag thus expressing
and bringing more into the
open their loyalty and respect
for the work of the UN. Last
fall there was quite a rush fori
these flags. Grinnell is a school
Where there is considerable ems
phasis on international politics
as evidenced by the conference
being held this weekend. i feel,
therefore, that we should dis-
play a UN flag. '
l Because of the building proe
l gram soon to take place on cen-
ltral campus and the expense of
a new flag pole, it is impossible
to put the flag out doors. (A
UN flag must be flown on an
equal basis with the US ﬂag.
neither above or below). The
Board of Religion objects to
placing one in the chapel. and
Darby and ARH are not the
best places for such a flag.

The purpose of this letter is
to find out if the students de-
sire such flag on our campus
and if so where they would
suggest putting it. Direct any
criticisms or suggestions to
mlem‘bers of the Student Coun-
Cl .

Yours truly,
