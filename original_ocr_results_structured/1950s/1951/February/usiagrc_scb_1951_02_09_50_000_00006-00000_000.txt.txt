Winkelman Tells
TrLI'l‘i‘lS, Simplici’ry
Of Caiholic Mass

The Catholic Mass has a
simple yet powerful signific-
ance. .

The Reverend w. S. Winkels
mann, Student Counselor and
teacher of religion- courses in

the commerce department at De

Paul University made this clear
when we interpreted the “Sac-
rifice of the Mass" for those who
attended chapel yesterday morn~
mg.

Sacrifice may be divided into‘

two conceptions, he explained
His analogy to the life of a
soldier who simultaneously ofv
fcrs himself to his country and
destroys his will, facilitated the
understanding of this, The Rev-
erend Winlrelmann continued by
tracing the history of sacrifice
from the Old Testament through
the life of Jesus.

”lt was Christ who instituted
the blessed sacrifice. Prior to
that time, flesh eating was con—
sidered a‘penance. But the dis-

ciples were prepared and none‘

objected when , Christ offered
His flesh 'and blood at the Last
Supper. This was the first Mass,
consummated on the mound of
Calvary. The Sacrifice of the
Mass' is the reproduction of the
Last Supper."

’ The Reverend Winkelmann

donned the vestmems worn by-

pricsts while performing the
Mass. He explained the signifi.
canoe of each article.

Ruth Atwater and Andy Bill~
ingsley were the worship as-
sistants, and the-Reverend Win-
kclmann was available for con-
sultation during the earlier part

-of ’the afternoon.

It’s a tradition that women are afraid ‘hf snakes. But contrary:
to that tradition, Frances Nakamura, Loose hall senior, spends

snake embryology.r
there’s nothing to read on the
subject, Frances must compare
snake embryos with those of

chicks. She has discovered they;

are much alike in development
but that the order of organ de-

‘ For her

‘ Study, Frances has

used eggs from a garter snake,
one at many collected by John
Merrill, Dibble senior, at Lake
‘Okoboji last summer.

Mary Borders, Read senior, is
studying the Neotoca species of
viviparous ﬁsh (those which are

, born alive) for her honors pra-

ject. Her problem is to unravel
the pro-fertilization changes and
all changes which occur at fer-
tilization. Mary has used about
loo slides in her study. The ma-
jority were made by Dr. Men-
,doza when he was at Northwest-
ern. While there, he had the-
Inch-long fish preserved in alco-
hol and sent from Mexico. in her
study, Mary sorts through the

. slides, trying to find eggs in var-

,ious stages. Hel- finishcd paper
will describe the eggs in their
process of of development. She
also expects to have photographs
or drawmgs to illustrate her
work.
