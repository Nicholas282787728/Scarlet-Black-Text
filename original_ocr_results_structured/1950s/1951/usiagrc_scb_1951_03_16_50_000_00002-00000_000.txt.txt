Honorary Review

As the time approaches when honors are heaped upon
the heads of expectant and surprised individuals it is time
to take a look at those organizations conferring the lions
01'5.

Just what is an honorary and what should it be? It
seems to us that it should first, of course, be made up of
persons selected for their work of an outstanding quality
in whatever the field. Then it would seem reasonable to cite
pect that their work continue after their acceptance into
the organization.

It also seems reasonable to expect that the organiza-
tion as a group, not as a collection of individuals, contributes
in a vital way to campus living. ‘

Some of the honorary groups are Mortar Board, Friars,
Players, Theta Sigma Phi, Sigma Delta Chi, Men’s and Wom- }
en's Honor G. Some of them contribute significantly to,
campus life, usually in the way of service. Some of them;
at least benefit the members themselves with a spirit of
fellowship and similar interests. Others Seem to exist sole-
ly for the purpose of getting enough money from the stu-
dent body at large to send their delegates to the national
convention each year.

In this year, with its spirit of a rather thorouglngoing‘
spring housecleaning, it might be a wise move for the stu-
dent committee on organizations to do a little reviewing
before granting any new leases on life,

Snow Sluggers Slam Thru

Take a last look at the melting snow. It just cost us‘
$500900. That’s Mr. Ralph Anderson’s estimate of the
all out effort to keep the college feet dry. With the size of
the operation the maintenance crew faced since Sunday, we
think a thank—you for their work is in order.

A crew of fifteen, the total maintenance crew with the
exception of. one man kept out as a rover, put in full time
from Sunday through Wednesday Probably there will be
men working through tomorrow clearing the Snow.

The Snow plow got hard use~running day and night
since Sunday. It has suffered four breakdowns.

The annual joke, which is wearing thin by now, of fill-
ing the bookstore entrance with snow cost, the students
$10 in labor. Next time, if there is one, it will cost them
their mail. The snow will not be removed and it will take
the students or Old Sol to make the doorway usable again.
