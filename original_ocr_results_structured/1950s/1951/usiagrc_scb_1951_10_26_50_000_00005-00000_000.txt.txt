ful of spectators on their home
field, Grinneu's Pioneers bogged
down in a Virtual quagmire and
driving thunderstorm to lose
their fourth straight Midwest
conference football game at the
hands of Monmouth by the lop-
sided score of Ill—Gr

Grinnell‘s only score came
late in the second quarter when
Don Hager gathered in Joe
Cdoper’s kickoff on the Grin—
nell 30 and returned the ball 70
yards behind excellent block-
ing for a touchdown. Ed Adud-
dell’s conversion attempt failed.

Hager’s run was the only time
during the game that the Pie-
neers penetrated within the
visitors’ 30 yard line. Only
twice, both in the first period,
did the Grinnallians advance to
the Scdts‘ 35.

Game statistics. in addition to
the score, indicate Monmouth’s
superiority on the field. While
the Scots collected 208 yards
rushing and 42 yards on three
passes, Grinnell had a net rush-
ing yardage of 16 and complete
ed ndne of nine passes.

Monmouth drew first
halfway through the first quar»
ter on a 51»yard drive with
Brown scoring from the one.

On the first second quarter
play Whiteman also plunged
Giver from the one yard line
after Grinnell fumbled on fourth
down on its own 17. A 54»
yard drive late in the same pe-
riod was climaxed by Brooks’
four yard spurt for the TD, The
score stood 18-0 for Monmouth
as Cdoper failed in three extra
point kicks.

Hager’s run on the next
kickoff completed the first half

The Pioneers will use their
single wing offense once again.
Grinnell hasn’t scored from this
formation in its first two trials
, in the Ripon and Monmouth con-
tests, although Don Hager did
run back a kickoff for a 72 yard
touchdown in the latter game.

Grinnell will have a fairly~

Musings
By Mead

As the football season reaches
its halfway point, it becomes
more and more evident that the
coaches of our fair conference
were a little off in their pres
season predictions, ,

These predictions were made!
at a conference meeting short-
ly before the start of the SQH'l
son, and the only thing thei
coaches seemed to agree on was
that Coe, last year’s champs,
were due to repeat. The only
dissenter to this was—guess
wheethe head coach of the
aforementidned Kohawks, who
picked his men fifth.

it seems he was pretty close to
correct, too. Though they have
played only three games, the
mighty Kohawks have managed
to lose two of them, and cur
rently find themselves in a fifth
place tie with Knox, who, by
the way, were picked a good
third. Ripon, chosen second in
the inaccurate ore-season poll,
‘find themselves riding high on
a four and nothing record.
Nothing very stunning about
that, true, but just look who’s
tied with them.

Lawrence, a futile fourth ace
icording to the mentors, have
an identical ftYur and nothing
record, and look like anything
jhut a fourth place hall club.
‘ Surprising? But the best is yet
to come. Little Monmouth,
picked for the lowly seventh
spot, is flexing its muscles
