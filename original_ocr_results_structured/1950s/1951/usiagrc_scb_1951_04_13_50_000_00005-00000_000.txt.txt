Without the aid of \vaterrwm

tl‘ackmen have been fighting them Way through the final stages of

preparation {oi the season openc

With the weather contributing everything from a need for

:nud guards on the runners to a

Sniffles, the Pioneers have been trying to improve their form from
that developed in the course of the outd of season.

The Goo Relays will be‘
tackled by a squad which seems
to be loaded in the field eventst
and rather wobbly in the tracki
area. The relays, being primer—l
ily just what they are titled,‘
will give the cindermen, starch—i
ed with sophomores, a real hike‘
for their money. The height-ande
distance entries for the Scarlet
and Black will be headed byt
sophomore Terry Ellis. the topl
single performer at Grinnell in
the indoor season. Ellis will re-
ceive plenty of help from field
specialists Alan Goldfarb in the.
shotput, Gardiner Button and
Skip Kingery in the pole vault,t
and Dave Stumbaugh.

Returning lettermen in the;
track group are distance men'
Tom Gage and Brett Taylor,‘
with Dick Fiedol‘owicz the sole
letterellolder in the sprint class,

The only general summing up
that can be done at this time
about the prospects of the track
team is that there will be at
chance for new men to work
their way up to find a place on
the lineup which will be used
by Coach E. G. Booth in latel'i
meets. The Goo Relays will pro-
vide a further proving ground

illrlldl‘t‘ To Meet Pm Team

l-Ionor G has taken to thc wilds of the business world and is in
the midst of a campaign to sell tickets to a basketball game be
tween the Grinncll College AlleStars and the Waterloo Hawks.
The8 encounter is slated to take place Tuesday night in Darby gym
at pin,

The Hawks feature the famous former Iowa U star. Murray
wier, along with a fine aggregation of timber topping players. The
AlleStars will be staffed by Grinnellians Dave Dunlop, Bob Eige-
low, Chet Lacy, Walt Fokoj, Bill Toomey, and former Pioneer star,
Earl Peisner.

The Hawks, who present a fast moving, skilled scoring game,
work off a single post with the other four men used in a weave.
Considering that most of the players on the professional squad
manage to measure around 6—ft Sun, the rebounding lends itself

well to this type of offense.
