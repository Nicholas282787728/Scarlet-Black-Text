Student Groups
Meet Stevens;
Set Investigation

Mr. Samuel Stevens, president
of the college called a meeting
Friday afternoon of about 40
student leaders. The student
Council, League Board, Council
of House Presidents and others
met to try to work out a plan
for suggesting improvements in
the student government.

‘Things Not Well‘

This grew out of the demon-
stration staged by the men the
Monday before, protesting the
League Board in general. Said
Mr, Stevens, “This has sharply
brought into focus ‘Things are
not well.”

In introducing the purpose of
the meeting, Mr. Stevens sa
three questionslpresented the
selves to him.

1. Why was the president
of the Council of House i
,Presidents not involved?

2. What particular problem
was being protested?

3. How could the action be
discipined?

Turning the meeting over to
Student Council presidentDuanei
Blough, the group discussed the‘
two areas which the men evi—
dently were attacking a the
rules themselves and the govern—
ing bodies, student and admin.
istrative, enforcing them.

Commission Proposals

The meeting, sober in tone,
took a turning point when Mr.
Stevens suggested a commission
of three men, three women, and
three students at large. After the
groups considered briefly the
faults and merits of such a plan,
he threw several suggestions out
to the group in rapid—fire order
reflecting his labor arbitration
background. The commission
which carried the vote includes
fourteen members a four from
the Student Council which in-
clude Duane Blough, Jim More
gan, Doe Jordan, and Wally.
Douma. Representatives of the
League Board are Ann Stillman.
Lolly Parker, and two members
of the new board to be elected.
Council of House President rep»
resentatives are Chet Lacy and
Ben Whitehill. The new C of
HP has not yet chosen any. The,
memberseatelarge from the stu—I
dent body will be announced. |

‘Closing the meeting with the}
admonishment, “What diminishesi
one of us, diminishes all of us,“
Mr. Stevens expressed hope that
careful work would result in
jusable findings.
