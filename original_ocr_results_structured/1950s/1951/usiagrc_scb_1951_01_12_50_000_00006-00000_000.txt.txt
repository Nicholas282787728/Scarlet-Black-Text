College Installs
Newest System
To Heat Campus

"This is not just another boila
er room. It Will be the show
place of the nation. it is the
biggest installation of its kind
in the United States.” This is
the way Mr. Ralph W. Ander—
son describes the new six unit
heating system recently installed
at Grinnell and scheduled to go
into operation sometime soon.

These new steam generators
were originally built for use in
diesel trains. This is the first
time they have been used for a
college or similar purposes.

“The system will produce 6;
000 pounds of steam per hour,"
says Mr. Anderson. “Just touch
this button and in 3 minutes
and 10 seconds you'll have 275
pounds of steam,” he pointed
out.

Each of the six units is a com—
plete bollermdm within itself.
They are oil burners and opea
ralte on a very cheap grade of
oi.

The Board of Religion is sponsoring a series of four Thurs—

Concerning differin patterns of

worship. These discussions will deal With both liturgical and non-
llturgical forms of worship and representatives of different faiths

will deliver the lectures.

The speakers will confine
themselves to the forms of war-

churches and will explain whatl
formal worship means to theml
and what place it occupies in
their respective faiths. This nar-
rowing of religious scope will
facilitate comparisons of the
varied worship patterns.

The program will include the
Reverend William J. Winkleman

Dean Wendell G,-Parr from
William Penn College at 0s-

kaioosa, iowa, explained the

Quaker concept of worship
during the chapel hour yester-
day morning.

"Obedience to the inner voice”
is the fundamental principle of
Quaker worship. said Dr. Farr.
He declared that this ”inner
voice" is available to anyone
who will open his heart to God.

The primary aim of the
Friends’ worship pattern is for
each member to reach the point
of having fellowship and com-
munion with God. “A group of
people" said Dr. Farr, ”with one
simple intent can bring a qual-
ity of intense energy that soli-
tary worship cannot offer." He
added that every person con.
tributes tc the atmosphere of
worship and that the strong in-
still their strength into the weak.

Dr. Farr stressed that silence

 

is to great importance in achieve
ing the Quaker goal. During the
“unprogramed” worship periods,
each person is free to contribute
to the meetings. There is no pre~
pared music, scripture reading,
or sermon. “Though silence may
be empty, it may also attain the

level of communion.”

"The Best Hope We Have"
was the topic that Mr. Row-

Mr. Chase related life at Grins

that “today we are not con.

Give Main Worry
In Dean's Office

G. Lester Duke, Dean of Men
at Grinnell, has asked any
Grinnell man who is interested
in changing housing for the sec-
ond semester, offacampus stu-
dents in particular, to see him
in his office at the student’s
earliest convenience. The stu-
dent’s first and second choices
will be recorded but, as Dean
Duke explained, “we can’tprom-
ise that first choices will be
granted in every case.” Whether
Younkel‘ Hall will be ready for
occupancy is still the number
one question.

Upon inquiry as to the ques-
tion of men leaving school in
the middle of a semester to en.
list, Dean Duke has asked that
anyone contemplating such a
move should without fail see
him in his office before leaving
school. Whether or not credit
would be given for an unﬁn~
ished semester would be discuss—
ed. There is a possibility that
credit may be granted, but as
yet there is nothing official and,
to quote Dean Duke, ”This does
not mean that men are advised
to leave school in the middle of
a semester; quite the contrary."

He said that the present coiri

States is a result of the underal

out of a bad situation. Mr. Chase;
emphasized that “we must put
spiritual values into this
struggle."

Grinneli Gives Movie World Premiere

Grinnell students saw them—

as more will see them, at the
"world premiere” showing of

The testimonials at the film’s

duction supervisor Herbert Pres-

long," he said. “Further, though
they left Grinnell in synchronh

that got thrown off." One man

The film should appeal pare
tieularly to parents of high
school students who are inters

college as well as education.
Enough Christmas snow was
