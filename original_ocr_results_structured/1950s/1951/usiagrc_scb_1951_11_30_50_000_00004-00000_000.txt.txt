Lost ,

for the title has narrowed down
to Cowles, Dibble, and Smith.
Cowles put themselves into

the top spot Thursday night by
beating Dibble 4-2, securing a
lecord of 19 wins and 5 losses.
Dibble is in second with 3 rec-
ord of 17 wins and 7 losses, with
9 of these wins and 3 of the
setebacks coming in the last
week.

Smith ran into a tough south
Younker team during the week,
and came out on the short end
of a 4-2 count, This dropped
Smith’s record to 11 wins out
of 18 games.

Trailing along behind the
forerunners are Langan, Gates,
Rawson, Clark, south Younker,
and north Younker in that or-
der. North Younker has been
unable to break into the scoring
column so fall this year, while
neighbors to the south have
picked up 7 wins in 18 games.

During the time from now un-
til Christmas vacation, the
schedule is packed with action
on every tree night, with the
final standings to be generally
determined during this time.

bribes and the Johnny Briglltl
incident, this must be counted
as (in asset, though losing teams
aren't exactly morale builders.

However, a good thing can be
carried too far, and it looks like
that is exactly what our college
might do.

I am reierring to the recent
suggestion of the faculty and
President Stevens that admis-
sion charges to athletic events
be abolished. Their reasons all
boil down to the tact that they
are afraid Grinnell will be ac»
cused of professionalism in 3th
letics.

Obviously, such an action
would remove any suspicion of
professionalism. Without gate
receipts, there can be no profit,
and without profit there can cer
tainly be no professionalism

However, there is one gaping
hole in such a philosophy Who-
ever so much as hinted that
Grinnell was going protession.
