Grinnell College. Grinnell. lowa. Friday. April 6, I95!

To High Men S+uclen+s

The brightest news on the
draft situation in a long while,
as far as Grinnell men are con.
cerned, was the announcement
from the White House that top
students will be deferred.

The deferments will apply
both to undergraduate and grade
uate study.

There are two conditions un-l

dei‘ which men may be deter-
red. Students will either have
good grades now, or score above
75 in a national aptitude test
which will be given on May 26,
June 16, and June 30.

in order to qualify on grades,
freshmen will have to be In the
upper half of their class, sopho—

mores in the upper twosthll

and juniors in the upper three-l

fourths.

College seniors will be per—
mitted to go on to graduate
school either by ranking in the
upper half of their class or by
scoring 75 or better on the na-
tional aptitude test.

Students are not required to

take the aptitude test if they al-l

ready rank in the necessaiy up—
per part of their class. Presi.
dent Stevens, however. has urge
ed that even men with top
grades take the test in order to
make a score of 70 or above, so
that deferment for next year
will be assured.

show the evolution of Negro
,duncmg from the early slave
,period to modern he—bop.

' Katherinc Flowcrs,trcupc dire
ector, says that the dancers not
only point out the contribution
the Negro has made to American
dancing, but also show that in
dancing as well as in music, the
‘Negro has come a long way
from his original primitive
sourcc.

Since none of the early slave
dances are being performed in
thc Unitcd States today, it was
necessary for the group to re
construct them from descriptions
