Grinnell Siuden‘is Say . . .

What do you think of the
possibility of reeinstituting
three hour finals in place of
the present terminal exam syse
Item?

John Peterson, Rawson sen-
ior: “It would be a good idea.
Better preparation for comps."

Ann Good, Mears junior:
“Terminals are better because
they keep the student up on his
work and avoid fruitless cram-
ming." .

Jim Chillas, Dibble junior:
“Strongly in favor of such a
change because one would then
have to know more and inte—
grate more to be able to pass
the exam."
