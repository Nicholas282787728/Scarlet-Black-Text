It's about time We made up our minds whether house
meetings are going to be false fronts for the solicitation of
funds or whatever else it is that they’re supposed to be. By
the time we get around to swatting our preps, our arms
are all worn out from digging into our pockets. . _ ‘

We have no gripe against supporting campus acthitles
which affect lls personally, but when we are told that cer—

tain worldwide charities are

worthy we wonder if there

aren’t hundreds of equally worthy charities. No one will
deny that the WSSF is a sincere cause descrvuig of our
Contributions, bllt who is going to draw the llne distinguish-

ing it from other sincere causes?

Who is to say that a

certain charity demands a contribution of two dollars, or

ten, or two hundred?

Most of us are living on the arbitrary allowances our
parents dole out to us plus whatever else we can earn at

the equally arbitrary student

rates. This combination rare-

ly makes for opulence. Most of our parents don't expect us

to support the same charities that they are constantly be—‘

ing bled by,

If we must be good fellows let's get it over with in one
contribution at the beginning of the semester, Let this con-
tribution be of a sum which the donor determines without

pressure or embarrassment,

Then the campus philan-i

throplsts can scramble for it as most of us had to do in the

first place.

Grinnell S’ruden’rs Say . . .

What sort of social functions
would you recommend for
Younker lounge?

Gem'ge Scott, south Younker
junior: “Should be used for all-
college events only, or as the
union lounge is used now.”

Carol Pitls, Haines sophomore:
“Should be open to all students
at any time . . . like the union.
Should be able to dance there.”

Ty Curtis, north Younker
freshman: “Think it should be
open all the time to anyone that
happens to be around."

Del Robison, north Younker
freshman: “Only for special of-
fairs and for hall parites.”

Gert Cowon, Read senior:
“Would be a good place for co-
ed studying and relaxing and
things."

The above question was sub-
mitted by Beth Budd, Loose
hall senior, and was judged best
by Charmcyne Wilke and Diane
Powell, Loose hall seniors, and
Peter Carlton, Chesterfield rep.

l Did Karen Andre commit
murder? The decision will be
made by a jury in ARH audi-
torium next Thursday, Friday
and Saturday nights.

At 3:30 p. in. on Nov. 1, z
and 3, the curtain will rise for
“The Night of January 16th,”
the homecoming play.
ploy, students, faculty, townsA
people and alumni, selected by
lot from the audience will form
the jury, They may not always
give the same verdict, however,
for the ploy has two possible
endings, depending on the ma-
jority decision of the audience
jury: “guilty" or “not guilty,”

As if choosing the most
dec ve participants in the
play directly from the un-
rehcorscd audience on the
evening of the perform—
ance weren’t enough, the
action includes seating many
of the key witnesses next
to unsuspecting spectators
and having them jump up
at a crucial moment to halt
the action of the play with

a shocking remark or piece

of evidence.

The plot centers around the
,elleged suicide of Bjorn Faulk-
ner, who is supposed to repre»

match king, financier, and phil—
anthropist of the late 1930’s. it
was rumored then that he had

Improve library
Conditions Says
Student Council

Better lighting and improving
general conditions in the library
made was one of the possible
projects brought up at the Stu~
dent Council meeting last night,

it was reported that the pro-
iect has been considered and
backed by the faculty, but no
action has been taken.

Susan Westcrfeld, Loose hall
senior, was appointed to inves
tigdte possibilities of having the
stacks at the library open more
than two hours a day.

Another possible project Con-
sidered by the council is to
place a light outside the student
union.

in a report on the advanced
communication course to be
offered to juniors next year its
two purposes were given. As a
practical course it will offer a
refresher in reading, writing
and speaking. The second part
will include a discussion of mu—
jor philosophical concepts. The
course will be required of all
students who have not had one
semester of speech and one sen-l»
ester of writing beyond basic
communications.

Narrator for the Student
Council program every two
weeks on KGRW is Mary Wood,

dent, Jim Morgnn, Gates senior,
emphasized the fact the council
iis bucking the Cyclone and
Arena in their circulation drives.

At the meeting it was pointed
out that students are welcome
to attend any meetings of the

lare cncournged to do so.
Due to a busy schedule next

Stimulating to the actors
as Well as the audience, the
play has been extremely
popular with community,
college and high School
groups, commented Kent
Andrews (drama), director.
It had a long run on Email-
way and toured the United
States 15 years ago.

Among the well»known peo
ple who have served on the
jury are Jack Dempsey, James
Footievelt, Babe Ruth and Helen
Keller. Record has it that a
jury aequits the defendant more
,often than it pronounces her
guilty, although the plot is
equally weighted in favor of
each possible verdict.

The cast of “The Night of
January 16th" is especially en-
, thusicstic, said Andrews, because
this is the first performance for
16 of the 20 cast members.

Reservations for the play can

statement he made toithe C of

Duke said that President
Samuel N, Stevens requested he
tell the council the curfew was
off, if both the students and
the athletic department were
jsatisfied with things as they
‘were. President Stevens asserts
,col through Duke that his decis-
ion prohibiting the building of
homecoming decorntions on the
loggis still stood.

Drinking and disorderly cons
duct infractions were also dis.
cussed by Duke. He sold come
ploints have come to him about
intoxicated men who visit the
quad and cause unnecessary em-
,barrsssment to the women and
l’the housemothers, The council
felt the drinking situation is
very much better then it has
been in previous years. They de-
cided, however, that anyone re
ported for causing trouble at the
quad would be subject to the
maximum penalty, suspensions
or expulsion from the college.

A report from Smith hall con-
cerned the trial of two men who
were found guilty of breaking
four windows while drunk. They
were fined s5 apiece plus dams

You spend years and years
building something and along
comes Simple Simon and you’re
back where you started, if not
worse. That’s the woman situzt»
tion at Collegium lowcnse.
Here's what i mean.

Girls graduate from high
school and come to college ex-
pecting to be treated like royal—
ty. They’ve seen lots of movies
and read the magazine, Sevcn—
teen. That kind of conditioning
is tough to lick but i think that
the men of ‘Grinnell had things
pretty well under control. No
one in his right mind would
have called for a date more than
three days ahead of time last
semester. The waitresses sit the
lThree Elms learned long ago to
bring couplcs separate checks.
Women knew their place. That
was before they opened the new
halls and the feminist movement
got under way.

in a few short months the
Younker porvcnus have msneg..
ed to ruin the south campus for
the rest of us with their nau-
seating chivalry, They send pret-
ty thank—you notes for exchange
dinners. They applaud and coo
at the rasping discord of seres
nades. Most of them already
have dates for the Christmas
formal. They’re so nice.

The men of Gates still expel
buckets of water from the tow-
er with bombsight accuracy; the
men of Rawson still know how
to eat dinner at the quad with»
out pretending to enjoy it; the
men of Cowles still toss .cherry
bombs and tin cans in a manner
reminiscent of the Market street
riots

Even the president of the Stu»
dent Council, our only success—
ful politician, had the moral
courage to kick a maggotty mon—
grel out of the quad dining
room above the squealing pros
tests of a few hundred dollies.
He really kicked it, too. (Has
anyone seen Chocolate lately.)

It’s not too late to restore the
single standard but the men on
this csmpus have their work
cut out for them, It can be done
with little things like cracking
knuckles in class and organizing
stag supper clubs for Sunday
nights.

If the pseudo lvy-Leaguers
at the Younker halls are allow-
ed to upset the balance of pow—
er between the two Campuses
it will be a sorry day for all of
us. Just consider the prospect
of tuxes and flowers every
weekend and decide for your»
selves.
