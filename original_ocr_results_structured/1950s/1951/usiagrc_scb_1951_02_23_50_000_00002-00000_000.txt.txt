To the editors;

All this emphasis on picking
the best leader to head the stu-
dent council may bc misplaced.
Perhaps it would be more feasi-
ble to concentrate our energies,
for onc your at least, on working
out a student government that
allows a good leader to spend
his time constructively.

Grinnell’s Student Government
is adequate. The c of HP,
League Board, and Social Hicr.
archy each fill and fulfill an im—
portant place in the system of
things. The Student Council does
a good job, too; BUT the trouble
seems to be that no one knows
what the Student Council does
_ they can’t see how the sc
affects them in their daily lives.
Obviously, this isn't a healthy
situation for an organization
.whose success depends on’large
participation.

Apparently the trouble lies in
the fact that the sc does not
deal with crmpus government
as a Whole, but rather is con.
fined to a narrow financial and
diplomatic ficld. The sc docs,
not have the time (because it’s!
bogged down by details # aski
nlough) or the power (or pre-
ccdcnt) to deal with the specific
problems that dircctly affect the
student.

What’s needed is a method of

government which makes it pos—1
sible for every student to kndwl

To The Editor:

This is an open letter to the
Student Body of Grinncil.

Last Monday morning in con—
vocation I was surprised and
disappointed in the 'Grinnell‘
student,body. We did have a
GUEST speaker.

At times during the lecture
the mumbling, whispering, and
giggling of students greatly sur-
passed the noise made by sev~
eral hundred kindergartcners.,
Granted your mind may wander‘
during convocation, was that any
reason for vocalization? There
is no excuse for rudeness to an
honored guest nor to the person
sitting in the adiacent seat who
wants to hear. We’re not a group
of gibbering idiots. but adults
with above average mentality,
who are here first to learn and
ilistcn.

i Wouldn’t d little cooperation
on the part of each student he
more courteous than the present
mumblings and rumblings? Who

To The Editor:

We are all aware of thc defic—
iencies of the present studcnt
government structure, There is
no need to elaborate on this
point. What we should be think-
ing about is how we can prop up
this sagging structure and in-

ews. We feel that Jim Morgan
is the student leader who can
accomplish this. The plan that
he presents is the needed change
student government has been
waiting for.

We therefore ask the student
body to consider carefully the
plan and to examine fully -all
of its reorganizing features. It

is not a'plan to be given only
momentary notice, but one to
he thought through with Jim.

if you really understand what
it can do, we are sure you will
see its value, Student governc
merit should be vital, dynamic,
and integral, Why should we
criticize when we can con.
struct?

Sincerely,
Joe Jordan

To The Editor:

We are among those support-
ing Beth Budd for student coun-
cil president.

This also means that we are
among those who believe in a
platform designed primarily BY
the students, instead of a "take-
itADt-leave—it“ ‘ list of ideas
thought out by only one peiu
son.

it means, too, that we believe
in building better government,
using the good parts of the
present system as a guide and
a foundation for improvement.

In short, we are among those
who believe in and are plai‘h
ning for a student council BY
the students, as well as FOR
them. And finally, this means
that we are among 1those who
want to see and are planning for
good government WITH 3 good

time. \

To the Editorsf

During this election the stu~
dents once again have an oppor»
tunity to vote for progress, The
program presented by Alan
Goldfsrb embodies that much
needed change. Al's program is
sound. He is a good administra-
for.

We feel that students who read
his platform carefully, who fol-
low the campaign closely; and
who want an effective voice in
student government will agree
with us. We can't go wrong.

Down with the Student Colm-
cill Up with student govern-
merit!

The freshmcn' halls are al-
ways considered prize virgin

,causc freshmen women don’t
‘know all the candidates as well
as uppcrciassmcn. they wait un-
til all the speakers and plat-
forms have been closely scrut-
inizcd before making thsir
choice. There is always concert-
ed action by the candidates to
woo their votes.

A hunch is thst there are
more women who turn up at the
polls to elect the president from
among'the two convention fin-

All this goes to show that w

women’s suffrage and should be
highly commended. It should
also be a warning to present
candidates to be mindful of the

He won first place in compe—

which couldn't hove left any
