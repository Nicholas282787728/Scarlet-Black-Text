'Shaggy Pioneers Defeat SUI
In First Western Grid Game

by Arnie Alpert

Sixty-six years ago this fall,
on Nov. 16, 1889, the original
Pioneer football team engaged in
the first inter-collegiate football
game west of the Mississippi. The
State University of Iowa fur-
nished the opposition on an im-
promptu field that ran north and
south between what are now
Blair hall and the women’s gym-
naslum.

After an initial revision of the
athletic program had been
slowed down by the cyclone of
1332, the student body and inter
ested members of the faculty ag-
itated for the adoption of some
sort of football at Grinnell. An
intramural game, hearing a strik-
ing resemblance to rugby, had
already enjoyed pepularity on
the campus. The hall was not
handled but moved back and
forth by kicking and “bumping
with the head.”

in 1889, s. U. I. offered a mil-
itary training program in which
a group of officers had intro-
duced the version of football
that was popular in most eastern
colleges. The innovation was
well-receiveﬂ and the Hawkeyes
eventually challenged any team
in the state to a game.

Frank Everest and Lou Van
Geison, both of Grinnell, had at
tended eastern prep schools and
were familiar with the new style
football. They led a campus ef-
fort to accept the challenge and
soon a team was rounded up.
The game was scheduled to be
played on the Grinnell campus,
Nov. 16.

The University of lowa team,
which purportedly journeyed
down to “bag a few of our corn-
field Canaries,” was greeted by a
ccnglomeration of spurof-the-
moment Grinnell uniforms,
“The Pioneer team presented
anything but an appearance that
more heterogeneous collection of
was beautiful," the student’s
“Newsletter” said, “In fact a
old clothes never disgraced an
intercollegiate contest.

Two only had regulation footv
ball pants. The others wore
sweaters, gyin jerseys, last sum-
mer‘s outing shorts, bicycle
pants, and one pair of genuine
blue jean overalls. The visiting
eleven was more fortunate, in
point of apparel at least. They
were fairly radiant in unspotted
suits of white canvas.”

There was no admission charge
to the game, but both before and
after the contest the manager
passed the hat and collected up-
wards of $10. This money was
used to purchase jackets for
Grinnell’s unkempt athletes be-
fore their next game. (The PJO<

Grinnell Tackles Coe Tomorrow

a starrstudded Coe eleven tomorrow night at Ward field.

“I don’t think that there was
any substituting either. If you
had a man you wanted to sub—
stitute, the man already in there
had to get hurt . . I think
we played 20 or 25 minute
halves, no quarters, and no
time out unless some one was
injured.

“At halftime . . . we just
walked over and sat down in
the shade of some trees since
there were no locker rooms,
“We didn’t use any huddle

worth four points and the kick
was worth two."
