Results of S813 Student Survey.

by Lori DeLlly and Marv Olsen
Bringing in namebands for formal dances is the first

choice of Grinnell students for the use of the addi

'onal

$2300 resulting from the increase in the social fee this
semester, an S&B survey showed this week. Appro imately
four hundred of the 500 questionnaires handed out were

returned.

Since students were asked to
indicate both their first and
second choices for the use of
the money, a weighing system
was used in totaling the anSA
Each first choice was
g1ven two points, while second
choices were given one. All the
points for each choice were
then added together, and their
percentage of the tothl de
termined.

Twentyeseven per cent of the
votes cast were in favor of
bringing in name bands for
dances, while the second choice,
having name bands 1n for just
concerts (which 1s much cheaper
than having them for dances),
received 21 per cent of the
votes. Stall Kenton alld Dave
were the two hands
most frequently mentioned with
those choices.

111 :1. close third spot with
18% of the votes was the pro.
posal to add the money to the
present Concert Series budget
to improve its programs.
Next 111 llne, and virtually

tied with 11% and 10% of tlle
votes respectively, were the
suggestions to odd the money
to the hall tunds, and to use
it for additions and improve-
nlellts to Lake Acre. Four per~
cent of the votes were in iavol'
of sponsorlng more lectures.

In addition to those choices
which were listed on the ques-
tionnaire, a number of people
made suggestions of their own.
Seven people said in one way
or another that they thought
the money should go back to
the students; three said to do
away with the increase in the
tuition, two mentioned adding
it to the scholarship fund, and
two suggested providing more
student jobs, Along these lines
too was the idea to use the
money for research to determine
just how tuition money is being
spent and to see if students are
leally getting what
paying for.

Various forms of informal

recreation also recewed sev»
el'lll votes, including sponsor»
ing more soc hops and record
dances, building a skating
rink, providing a record
library and listening room for
students, and carylng out the
“Pine Tree project."

Among the several suggestions
for physical alterations on
campus were the following:
build :1 new Union, enlarge the
Union, buy a clothes dryer, put
more washrooms on James
third, install water coolers in
the rest of the men‘s halls, put
in milk machines, get a cold
burr machine, and “buy a bomb
to blow up the school."

KGRW Starts Broadcasting Activities,
"Heartbeat" Pitter-

never changing partners at
college dances has only custom
and overdone conformity as its
basis. ln an effort to alter this
tradition, we have arranged
with the bandleader to have
special exchange dances." The
dances, about 10 of them, will
be numbered and will be an~
nounced at different intervals
during the evening.

“Couples will find the bids
and pencils at the dance," rat
added, “but, we suggest that
they make arrangements
among themselves before that
evening. Since there will be
so many new students pros—
ont, we hope this will give
'them, as well as the old stu—
dents, a chance to meet new
people and enjoy themselves
more.”

A large mobile over the band
is the main feature of the deer
orations, but the modern and
abstract theme is carried out in
flats arranged around the wall.
The Social Calendar committee ,
will act as chapel‘ones for the

dance.
