Pioneer Hill ‘n' Dalers Encounter
Carleton's Defending Champions

The undefeated Pioneer cross-
country team will seek its fifth
successive victory tomorrow
against Carleton college at
Northfield, Minn. The Carls,
who have won the Midwest cone
ference championship for the
last four years in a row, should
provide Grinnell's stitfest com-
petition to date.

Grinnell finished second in the
league last year and lost its only
decision on a six—meet schedule
to the Knights by a 2740 score.

Carleton boasts a 3-0 record
this year with victories over
Coe, Macalcster, and St. Olaf.
The oarls snared the first five
places against Coe for a 15-43
win.

Big man for the Knights is
Wilbur oison who has turned
in remarkable times in winning
two meets and who was third in
last year’s conference meet. Be-
hind wilbur come captain Earl
Neil, Marty Baker, Paul
Schultz, and Steve Kling.

On the basis of 1955 perform-

ances, the pioneer harriers stand
as good a chancc as anyone to
stop the Carls. Coach E, G,
Booth’s squad is anxious to
avenge the loss last season.
which marred an otherwise un-
blemished record.

Gl'innell has taken four of the
first five places in all but one
meet this season. George Drake
has nabbed first place three
times. Two other letterwinners,
Captain Bulb Downs and Larry
Schaieger give Drake excellent
support.

Dan Ver Floeg, John Wolden,
Fritz Goreham, and Ed Jantz
have added sound depth to the
squad with impressive Imishes
this year.

Runners from South Dakota
State will also be in the meet.
State has been perennially
strong cross—country and this
year is no exception. Last year
State swept the first five places
against Carleton in a dual meet.

 

Football Co-Captain Jones

Heads Pioneers End Corps

by Dennis Watson

In the shadow of Darby gym
lives the football co—captain for
the Pioneers. Paul Jones. Paul
is a senior phys. ed. major who
lives in the college barracks
with his wife, Helen. and two
tow—headed daughters, Paula and
Carla.

Paul is a four year navy veta
eran who first attended Grin-
nell during the academic years
of '47449 and '49»5o. During this
time he played football for the
?ioneers and picked up his first
varsity lettci- playing end dur-
ing his sophomore year, Last
year he returned to aid the Flor
neers in their ’54 gridiron season
and this year is back as oo-
captain of the varsity squad
along .with Dick Walker.

The Adel, lowa, senior is in
his third year of men’s honor
G but finds little time for other
extracurricular activities which
is understandable of any young
man who is attending college,
playing football and last but far
from least, supporting a family,

As to the '55 Pioneer squad
Paul remarks that. ”basically
we have a very good outfit with
lots of spirit and the urge to
play ball”. Paul commented on
the fact that there are no really
big stars on the team and every
man does his job. He also men-
tioned that there is a terrific
nucleus of freshmen this year.

An interesting aspect of

Pélul’s gridiron career is the

fact that in the four years he

has played at Grinneu he has
been under four different

coaches: Bernie Oakcs in '48;

Henry A. (Bank) Brown in

’49; John l>litsch in ’54; Ro-

bert A. (pate) Peterson in

'55

When he finishes at Grinnell,

A parent‘s day crowd of

Long runs kept the home

the contest as the local boys
exploded in what proved to be
their most impressive triumph
thus far.

Defense Tough

Though Bob Peterson's crew
fell behind their opponents in
first downs, 13-13, the Scarlet
and Black rushed for so more
yards than did Ripon, It proved
to be the difference as Grinnell
held the Redmen scoreless after
the first period.

Dick Walker comprised the

by Special Dispatch

. The 'Mld/West conference grid
race was narrowed to. two
teams this past Saturday when
Coe and St. Olaf kept their
slates clean by downing the two
closest contenders, Carleton and
Cornell.

Although three teams. Carlee
ton, Cornell, and Grinnell are
still mathematically in the race,
with two losses apiece, the out-
look is for Coe and St. Olaf to
meet for the championship on
Nov, 12. the last day of the sea-
son, at Cedar Rapids.

Coe vs. Cornell

Coe has a big hurdle this
week in the form of an up—andr
coming Cornell team which gave
St. Olaf a surprisingly hard
time last Saturday. The score
was 20-7 for St. Olaf.

Cornell would like nothing
better than to knock off its
closest rival before a Cornell
Homecoming crowd, The Ko-
ha’wks are favored. however, on
the basis of their resounding
4644. win over Carleton this past
Saturday.
