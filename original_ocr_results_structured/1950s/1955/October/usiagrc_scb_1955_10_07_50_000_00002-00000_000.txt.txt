“Why Prepping 0n lhis Campus?"
Several Solutions Posed By Prep

by Sheen Clark

, This question has phrased and rephrased itself in the

minds (yes, wehave them),
weeks:

of preps during these last two

”Why, exactly, is there prepping on THIS campus, or

ANY campus?”
It’s very simple,
men’s ego with the

we’re here to inflate the upperclass—
“0, most exalted upperclassman" halt,

and to keep them in good humor during their aging years.

And Way are these upperclass-
men on THIS campus, or ANY
campus, because life Wouldn't
be complete without them. Any‘
way, why shouldn‘t we want to
sleep all night? or why don’t
we Want to know all the verses
of all the songs? And besides
this, ’how else would a certain
prepmaster get the names and
addresses of twenty freshman
girls for his personal list hetero
the herd book comes out?

It also must be tiken into
consideration that the prepping
given the freshmen is nothing
compared to the initiations
some Bafﬂe Board members are
getting. wierd tales have been
heard as to a case of disappear-
ing sheets. and a treasure hunt
at midnight to get them back,
“palimtl‘ee” awards for duty
above and 'beyond the call, and
signs from the phantom saying
“i will strike again."

The tales from the Quad are
nothing compared. to what the
elusive-hall of the {rm
elm sullen on North Camp-
us. Nothing is more astonish-
ing when one is talking to a
member of the elustveshalf
than to hear the shout, “But-
ton, prep!", and to see him

KGRW

Beginning Monday at
10:30 KGRW listeners will
be treated to the music of
“The Uptown Four," Grin-
nell’s new jazz dance combo.

The quartet features Charley
Hastings on piano. Larry Laur
on alto sax, John Roberts on
trumpet, and John Nielsen on
drums.

“The Uptown Four" will
play for 15 minutes each
Monday. Hastings said, “Our
style is pretty hard to deﬁne
briefly. It could be called
mildly progressive, improvised
3312 for dancing, I guess.

“We play all kinds of music
“everything from the old Dixiea
land tunes to the other ex~
treme, stuff like Sentimental
Journey.‘ Our theme is 3 Ken-
ton—like rilf called ‘Jump for
Jay."

C of HP Vales To Seal

Hewitt as Radio Reporter

The C of HP, at the Tues<
day night meeting, voted to
seat Dick Hewitt as KGRW
reporter, Hewitt is in addi-
tion to the S&B reporter
who was approved last
spring. Hewitt is subject to
the same regulations as the
38:13 reporter.

Grinnell's weather can also be
blammed on a prepmastsr. It
seems that there was a whole
hall out doing dances to the
God of Rain. Not to be outdone
by this, others had fire drills.
The methcld used during this
drill should not need explaning;
just listen for the groans of
anguish when someone hends
over to pick up a book.

No one seems to be immune to
gigs, or blacklisting, as the case
may be. Of course. some get
them faster than others. There
was a time when two fresh
were waiting for the noon train
to pass, when down came fiif~
teen upperclassmen crowding
the poor frosh art the sidewalk.
Needless to say, each got 15
black marks.

We're getting our revenge,
however! The upperclassmen
couldn't seem to “hold” against
the frosh charging line, and a
”no prepping day" was given to
the winners. All‘in all, we‘re
glad we’re preps, since how else
would we get cute little red
and black beanies all for‘our

Jitters

To the Editor:

It is a standing joke among
the memlbers of the cross-
country team Concerning the
crowds which turn out to see
us run. Last Saturday, however,
the new Grinnell spirit was ex-
pressed when we abtually had
spectators come to the rout of

- St. Olaf.

Speaking for the team, I
wanted to write this letter to
let those who came know that
their encouragement is fully ap-
preciated at the end of three
miles of hard running. Thanks
a lot, and the '55 cross country
team intends to (bring the
Championship to Grinnell this
Year.

“Try-Em”

The Sound
and
The Fury

by Art Travers

The winner 0: the dining i
room's new game, “Button Buta
ton Who’s Got The Button?” is
John Wallace. He found it in
his chili last wcck. He wins an
autographed picture of Alphon-
zo Zark (Isn’t it amazing how
much he looks like PFGY), an
eataeal‘ly card. and a hook en-
titled, “You Can Live with
Your Indigestion". t

OH ',We Go Into the \Vild
Blue Yonder Dept: It might

be a good thing if the AFRO-
TC would spend more time ion
their exam. I know of ,one
case already this .year.

Two fellows studied hard the
night before the exam and re-
ceived the lowest grades in the
class, while another gentleman
forgot about the test completely
until one hour before the test
and received one of the highest
grades. If this is indicative or
ROTC tests, something drastic
should ’be done. Freshmen and
sophomores are required to take
the basic course.

They ,ottcnd class two days
a week, and during warm
weather attend drill twice
weekly. On days when there
is drill they wear their imi-
form from 3:00 A M. 'to 12:00
A. in. One hour is hunted this
course when grade point aver
ages are ﬁgured out but there
is no credit given towards
graduation requirements. The
lnshmen and sophomores de-
serve examinations which will
accurately gauge ability. lrhey
don't scan to 'be getting them.

I’d like to play mwmmc'lm
wows again. This is a game
which is easy to play. You just
sit back and think.

I’d like to see part or Pine
Tree open for couples who want
to toe either alone or with a
few friends for the purpose o4
talking or listening to music.

l‘d.l.lke to see new ping
pong paddles in the union
more alien;

rd still like to see cigarette
maohiucs in rvarlnius places to

vend cigarettes (Mostly when
the 5300mm is closed.)

I'd like to see freshmen work.-
ing at Lake acre as part of
prepping.

I’d like to see College Co-op
movies here at Grinnell.
