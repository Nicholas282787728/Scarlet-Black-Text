The most important campus position at Grinnell is the
C of HP presidency. Almost all G 'nnell students read some
section of a daily newspaper regularly. Grinnell women
still want to get married, but they also want to have careers.
Freshmen and sophomores at Grinnell go to church more

than juniors and seniors.

These and many more inter-
esting and enlightening pieces
of intormation were recently
revealed ln (our sul‘vms 0011*

aires averaged almost 500 out
