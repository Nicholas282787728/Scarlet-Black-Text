2t gaily decorated Christmas tree in a corner of the room

caught the attention and deli
Candlelight reflected the shin-
ing eyes and faces of the boys
and girls seated around the
tables as a .prayer of apprecia-
tion and thankfulness was
heard Almost before the men
rwlas given, however, those lit-
tle unmponiant motions of ex-
cited children became audible,
and once again laughter and ex-
cited voices filled the room.

'nhus began what was for
tmtztny of these children prabr
'albly the highlight of their
Christmas celebrations, Taking
a child or two to dinner and
enter-wards to the show in mud
may have seemed a very small
thing to you, hut words cans
not empress the happiness which
was reflected by the children
who attended the party,

on hehalt ni Uncle Sam's

club I want to sincerely thank
all 17‘ you students who help-
ed to give many or Grinnell’s
children an evening that will
remain a ,hxight spot in their
memories throughout the
cnr'etrnas season. I am cer~
tainly proud to he part or a
college at which the students
recognize the needs or others
and [appreciate the value or
giving without expecting any—
thing in return.

Many people contributed to
the success or this event, Per
haps a mention of some would
convey a general note of ap-
preciation to all. To Dave
Stevenson and Dary Smith to
whom most of the burden of
the operation went, to th
Dickinson who gave so much oi
his time and energy, to Mr.
Gooselaw for the food prepar-
ation and use of the dining
ro‘om, to the waiters whose sets
vice was so necessary in making
the pointy a success, and to the
people who provided transpor—
tation, as well as to the entire
cairnrpus, goes a hearty Thanks.
