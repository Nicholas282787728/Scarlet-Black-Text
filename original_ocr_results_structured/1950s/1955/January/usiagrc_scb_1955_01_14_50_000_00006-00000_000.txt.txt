representation of reality. We
see a series of roughly perpen—
dicular lines, heavy, rough
edged, made by wide black
brush strokes, strokes diiierent
in client lrom, for example,
hard pen’ lines which might
convey directness, simplicity,
precision.

There are also counter strokes,
generally opposite to the per-
pendicularsi We get a sense of
power in the heaviness, direct-
ness of the downward and cross
strokes against various whites
and greys of the background.
The edges of the blacks run
into the white making greys
and rough whites. Sumbreness
is conveygd, and this emotion
derived from these rough
blacks and whites in motion.

What is attractive to us is

the'yicture’s relation to a
unity we know though we
are rarely conscious of reality
in this Wily.
’ For power, and movement
and sombreness do wme to us
in heavy lines — such things
as lists of figures in columns
and what they usually repre-
sent, heavy bars, traditional
blackness as related. to deathV
parallel lines suggesting conti-
nuity, continuity suggesting
movement _ things continually
present in the world around us,
and always making their mean-
ing felt, whether we are cons‘
Scions of it or not.

This picture attempts to
convey an emotion by order-
ing in a special way such
highly charged symbols as
rough heavy Lines and their
sin-rounding “planes.”

Zl‘he difficult success that aba
stract- art struggles to obtain
is the wedding of subjective
emotion tonne and color in
such a way that a subjective
emotional condition is rendered,
representative. These two seem.-
ingiy unrelated things are
brought together and we do rer
spend to_,them. The better the
artist, the more he controls
our response,

Cervme wants to
what he feels through his pic-
ture which works a series of
possible emotions into one
particular motion, on which
organizes the picture. He tries
to order things in a way that
allows Is to move into his.
mind through a series of synt-
holsi

He reveals his mind in such
a way that comparison becomes

possible, which is important be.‘

cause we can know our own
minds only to that degree that
we know other minds.

This is one kind of learning
and the pleasure we get is in
discovery. The enjoyment is in
recognizing distinctions; and mi
this art it is controlled color
which helps us to see these dis-
tinctions. '

The large questions we ask
aster we begin to recognize 1
relationships (this recognition
makes the hard work for the
unfamiliar): does the picture
move IE? does it order the
emotion to mean something in
a proiound way? The value
judgement then would be re»
lated to the achievement oi .

Cervene's pictures tell us that
it is difficult to evaluate ab~
stract art chieﬂy because it
demands work, an end to lazi-
ness about the question, an es.
fort to familiarize ourselves
with the medium.

To say that the medium
doesn't make sense Tums, in
most cases, that we do not
understand it. And of course
the only way to understand
is to study.

with painting it means CDn—
tinual “looking”, continual will—

in abeyance. it means attempt-
ing to analyze exactly what is
in the picture that repels or
