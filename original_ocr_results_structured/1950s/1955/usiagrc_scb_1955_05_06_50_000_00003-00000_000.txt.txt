About Academic

Miss Nancy Oates, Advisor
Scarlet and Black
Grinnell College

Dear Nancy:

0f Impressions
life In Ireland

9 Butterfield Park, Rathfzrnham
Dublin, Ireland
March 28, 1955

I was glad to have your request for a letter for the Scarlet and

Black; it will enable me to gre
afraid I have not been a very

et all my Grinnell Iriends. I am
good letter wrlter this year, for

there has been a great deal to do and lo see. But we think of
Grinnell Very_ often, and the mail always seems more exclting
when it Contains letters from home.

First, just a word about
what I am doing. Alter that,
I will, go on to some general
impr sions ot Ireland, es-
pecially academic life in her
land.

We landed in Dublin on Sep~
tcmber 9 (after spending a
very pleasant summer in Ger
many and the Netherlands visit—
ing Mrs. Bradford’s brothers),
Shortly after our arrival we
found a house—my choice was
no doubt swayed by the fact
that W, B, Yeats spent the last
seven years of his life here and
the house which be occupied
is only a few blocks from us. I
have been working all winter
long with the Yeats mantle
scripts in MIs. Yeats collection.
Mrs. Yeats has been very kind
to us, and we have enjoyed our
association with her. Her stories
of Yeats and others bring the
whole literary movement very
close,

But I must get on to aca-
demic Irelandl As you know, I
am Visiting Lecturer in Ameri—
can Literature at Trinity Col-
lege. Dublin. Trinity was found-
ed in 1597 by Queen Elizabeth
—she is still duly thanked in
the Latin grace that follows
each dinner in the Commons.
Most oi its present buildings
date from the 18th century. and
they are magnificant examples
of Georgian architecture. The
Trinity grounds, which are ex-
tensive, are now in the very
center of Dublin. The whole is
surrounded by an immense wall
and railing, so when you enter
the College through one of the
gates you seem to have turned
back the calendar two centuries.

Trinity makes certain oom-
promises with the twentieth
century, but tries hard to re-
tain the merits of an older
way of life, students and face
ulty alike wear gowns to
classes and to all official
functions, including dinner at
nightsThe shabbier the gown,
the more respectable, it is not
fully respectable until so torn
it barely holds together. One
oi the great tragedies is the
disintegration of one’s gown
to the point where it,really
has to be replaced The fac-
ulty club—it is called the
Common Room—has one of
Ireland‘s finest wine cellars.
At one iestival dinner 1 was
served a port that had been
put up in 1911 when I was
six years old,

Academic life is very differ-
ently organized from the pat-
tern it has taken in the United
states. There are no course exe
aminations, and courses are
much less important than they
are with us.
lecture terms, each seven weeks
long. Most lectures meet only

once a week e even language-

classes meet only twice. Almost
nobody reads the books that the
lecturer is talking about—they
do their reading during the long
vacations at Christmas, at Eas-
ter, and in the summer. I have
found it very hard to adapt mye

self to this. it means that there
is no discussion. very few ques
tions even, The students sit
there, busily taking it all down,
so that they can refer to their
notes six months later when
they are doing their reading.
Also, with so few lectures
each term, a teacher of litera-
ture rarely gets time for the‘
detailed discussion of poem,
play. or noveliwhich in any,
event would be largely a wastei
of time since the students havcl
not yet read the text being dis
cussed. In America, the teacher
does too much of the work and,
the student too little; here it is
the other way around, You
spend far too much of your
time in classrooms and too little
in libraries and laboratarles;‘
here too little time is spent my
the classroom. There must bel
some happy medium between
these two extremes it we could
but find it.
...... The students themselves are
very much like young people
everywhere; they have sim- ,
ilar interests, similar ambi-
tions. They are politcr than
you are—almost too polite I
sometimes think, though this i
is in keeping with the great. |
er iormality that prevails
everywhere in Irish life. At
student aliairs where faculty
members are gucsts, they are
very gracious hosts. They
seem less mature than you,
and indeed young men and
women coming to the univer-
sity will have led what would
seem to you a very cloistcred
liie in their preparatory
schools. They loave these

schools for college much bet-
ter prepared than most of
you in English composition,
languagos, mathematics, and
basic science, but I have never
felt inclined to hold you rc-
sponsihlc for the failures of
American secondary education.
However, these deficiencies
become almost glaring when
one is away from the Ameri-
can sccne. Certainly the trans-
ition from school to college is
much less difiicult for them
than it is for most of you;
the miseries ol the freshman
year in America, when many
of you learn to study for the
iirst time in your lives, simp-
ly do not exist.

There is very little that
is “collegiate" in the Amer
ican sense about Trinity.
John Pfitsch would think
the sport program not so
much organized as disorgan—
ized, though Trinity does
manage to field teams in the

various sports after a ﬁsh
ion. There are no prnfes-
sionnl coaches, Dramatic
productions are entirely run
by students, and are decide
edly more amateurish than
you manage with the help
of Kim Chase. Mimic at

Trinity is very good.

I think a rather mixed pics
ture emerges from these ran
dom impressions; there are
things that we could learn from
them, things that they could
learn from us. All of this has
left me wishing that the ex
change student program could
go much further than it has.
Most of you would benefit by
a year abroad, most of them by
a year in the United states. I
am. however, certain of one
thing: American society gives
its young people a much better
time than they are given any—
where else I have beenithe
whole atmosphere is freer, and

WINSTON tastes good— ,

like a cigarette should!

I No wonder Winston‘s winning so many
friends so fast! College smokers found
ﬂavor in a ﬁlter cigarette when they found
Winston. It's got real tobacco ﬂavor!

Along with ﬁner ﬂavor, Winston also
brings you a ﬁner ﬁlter. The exclusive
Winston ﬁlter works so effectively, yet
doesn't "thin" the taste or ﬂatten the ﬂavor.
