. We are in college to better

prepare ourselves to accept it.

But we can’t do it alone. We, American college students,
are not sufficient unto ourselves, any more than the Ameri-

can nation can abstract itself

from the international situa»
better place we must work

together with people of our age in other nations. We don’t
want assistants in this task; we want associates. The only
way we can have them, is to help them educate themselves

for this role, as we are doing

now.

The World University Service attempts to do the job,
but they can do nothing without our moral and financial
support. The ability of these students to assume our mutual
responsibility to the world depends upon our sense of res

Cadets ‘Fire Up’
To Pray for Rain

Postponing Drill

’ About 60 R. O. T. C.

cadets
gathered irevently around a
[hon-fire to pray for rain last
night. On the eve of the first
drill cf the year, the cadets made
a futile attempt to gain deliver-
ance .from dhc invasion of their
9 o'clock union period.

Amid shouu of “fire up". the
group circled round lhe fire hops
ing for the miracle. Some tried
to speed up the natural phenomv
enon by c bucket brigade of
water. But, after deciding that
MacEzchron Field could weather
the mannmade shower, they ice
treated in defeat, Lighl showers
gave the cadets partial consola-

This is by way of clarification.
The faculty and administra-
tion often show Considerable in-
terest in Student Council opin»
ion on numerous questions
touching the entire College.

However, 5. C. opinion may
not always be validly equated
with student opinion. 5. C. pui-
sues a divided policy in refer-
ring or not referring questions
back to the halls, and a hall has
no assurance that its represen-
tative will always favor refer.
ring questions ’back to it.

Further, it has no assurance
that its representative will rep-
resent the hall when its opinion
has been expressed. \

in practice, 5. C. usually has
referred important questions
to the halls. Sometimes, how~
ever, the Council neglects dc—
ing so in regard to questions-
that it fails to realize will bc
considered signiﬁcant ind/oi-

on which student opinion is
unknown. This is Where mis»
understanding and undemo-
cratic functioning occurs This
is a point of legitimate criti-
cism made by those who be-
lieve representatives should.
represent and not become an
elected nligarchy.

Students, faculty and admi - -

istraiion alike should realize
this when they slide into the
fallacy that any given 5. c. op»
inion or action is representative
of the student body.

Halls should deliberately, con-
sciously choose either represen-
tatives or autocrats to represent
them on the Council and, con—
sequently, before the faculty,
administration and trustees.

s. 0. tries to he democratic
most of the time. Its few failv
uics, however, are alien dra-
matic. Thcsc fcw doazics make
students lose faith in Student
Council.

Sincerely,

The Sound Kassebaum Gives SC Reasons

and

The Fury

by Art Travers

Once upon d lime there was
21 tiny village. There was, at.
this village, a monastery which
had become fairly prominent in
leaching alchemy, rhetoric, and
theological history. As its reps
utatlon spread, more and more
petty nobles sent their pages
and issue to this village to be
instructed in these areas. One
of the monks, an insiiuclci in
feudal politics, had Come to the
mcncsieiy from a distant land
afici- being exiled by an auto~
cram duke. in addition to his
teaching, he found time in write
several books which increased
his already widespread fame.
Strangely enough, the one place
where he Was lcasl appreciated
was this monastery. Perhaps,
this was due to the fact that
modesty was not one of his cub
standing viiiues At any rate
there were some feelings against
him,

Finally there was a festival in
a neighboring town in his hon-
or. A slalosmnn from a neigh
boring duchy was there. So were
several of the pages and stun
dcnfs. There was, however, a
paucity cf his monastic breth-
ren, So that's the story What
does it prove? Perhaps, that
even monks can be narrow at
times.

Thcic seems to be some que5v
lion as to the source of the line
of these jottings, It comes from
the name of the Faulkner (type-
setter please note the ”U")
novel. The name of the Faulkner
novel no doubt Comes from
that Shakespearean quotation
which was nicely approximated
in a certain letter, There is no
special significance to the title
(Since 1 bring the number of
columnists for this year's S&B
lb five, perhaps the Fifth
Column would be more appro-
priate.) At any rate the title
is only a means of identifica—
(ion.

For Ruling Oui'

by Ken Knsschdum

Late last spring the idea was
brought forth to have milk mar
chines on the north and south
campuses. The Student Council
took up the proposal and di~
rected an inquiry into the mac
ter, most of which was conduct-
ed in the fall of this school
year. The results of the investir
gations were discussed by the
Council and the conclusions
drawn were announced to the

student body. However, due to
recenl reagitation among the
students concerning milk ma-
chines, the Council wishes to
make known again the probe
lems involved and the conclu-
sions it reached.

The cuprvendol‘ type of ma-
chine was suggested and TB-
jectecl. These machines require
special plumbing which would
raise difficulties in installation,
The milk is kept in a large vat,
making guaranteed freshness im-
possible if the milk was not
used and replaced rapidly
cnoughjli was felt that cups
would cause a disposal problem
and the possibilizy of a clulfcn
ed campus would hinder the
chances of administration ap-
proval. The fact that it would
be less convenient to carry milk
in cups to the students‘ rooms
was mentioned. Also, the fact
was established through good
authority that this type of mac
chine would cause considerable

1 am fold. by those who should
know, any number of advant-
ages in the Constructing and
printing of the book. But don't
let this fool you. It goes against
tradition. Is nothing sacred any-
more?

DINING ROOM MUSINGS

DEPARTMENT: This past Wade
nesday's lunch, with its maca—
i-oni and corn casserole, was
probably the type of thing that
inspired Koestler’s “Darkness At
Noon" Anyone for Joe Bull’s?

Milk Machines

maihfninanc‘e 'diffi’culiy. A 7“

A machine containing milk‘ in
1/: pint cartons was suggested.
As this machine would require
no special plumbing and would
present less of a disposal prob-
lem for the Containers, this was
investigated. However, the Coun-
cil felt that a decisive fall in
the sale of Cakes would result.
The best deal that could be ar-
ranged with a local dairy gave
a profit of only 11/; cents or 15%
per 1/2 pint. Comparing this with
a profit of almost 50% which
we receive from the Coke 531a,
the small milk profit could not
balance the loss in Coke profit.
There is the necessity for a pro-
fit to be derived from these con-
cessions, as the money consti-
tutes a special fund 10 support
a foreign student each year to
attend Grinnell. This fund would
be further depleted by the cost .
for increased maintainance to
include the milk machines. if
this fund were to be reduced,
we would no longer be able to
bring a foreign student here to
school, The Council expressed
the desire to continue this pol»
icy.

Pertinent problems included
the fact that milk machines
would have to be placed indoors
to keep from freezing in the
winter. This led to the ques-
tion of location. Also, as local
dairies satisfy the local demand
for milk. it was considered un-
desirable to procure milk from
out of town.

These are the facts, As the
Student Council icpicseng the
student body, the students have
the right to voice their opinions
to the Ccuncll about the kind

-of Concessions to have and the

policy concerning the receipts

fioni those concessions. We will
welcome any suggestiom forth-

coming from them.
