Students to Vote
On Late Cyclone
Publication Date

At Monday housemeetings
Grinnell students will. vote on
the possibility of having the ey-
clone published in the fall in-
staad of the spring, as in pre-
vious years.

Ed Ho, business manager of
the yearbook, stated that if the
results are favorable to fall pu‘b-
lication, they will be presented
to the new committee on Student
Publications. If they aprpl‘ove it,
the 1956 yearbook will come out
in the fall.

Ho stated the following as
advantages of fall publioation:

The editor has more time to
plan the book. The plans can be
worked out in the summer and
then discussed with the staff. In
this my, tlhe students have more
to say about their yearbook,

Spring activities will be in-
cluded in the Cyclone. Under the
present system, all spring activ-
ities, such as musical and the
picnic, go into ﬂhe next year’s
book.

The Cyclone stadf can save
$450 in publication costs by puba
lishing the book in the fall,

Deadlines for spring publica—
tion are frequently missed, which
results in fall publication any.‘
way. 1

The book, which will still be 4 V
sold on the present basis, will ~
be mailed to all graduating sen-
iors and other students not re-
turning to the campus in the
tall.

The advantage to the present[
spring delivery is that the hookl
will be in the student's hands
when he leaves. The staff feels
that this is far outweighed byl
the numerous advantages of fall
delivery. Many of the large c011
logos and universities are new

Correction

in the feature story on the
Student Musical in last week’s
SdtB, the conception and produc
tion oithc first student musical
was mistakenly attributed to
Jim Leavenworth. Stu Roeder
was not only the mind behind

the first musical, but he directed
and designed the production.

Roeder was awarded the first
‘Order of the Scarlet and Black'
upon his graduation in 1950, “for
outstanding personal contribu—
tion to the hie or the college
community."
