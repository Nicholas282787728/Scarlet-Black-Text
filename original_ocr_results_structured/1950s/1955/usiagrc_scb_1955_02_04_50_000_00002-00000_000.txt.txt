Evidence Of Apathy

It is a poor reflection upon the students of the college
that there are only two people willing to take on the Stu-
dent Council presidency, two willing to edit the student
newspaper, and one to edit the college year book.

Apathy is a passive quality and action seldom results
from it, but .its effects can be disasterous. When it seizes
an individual or institution, a withering process setsl'n. Not
only is no positive action taken, but the status quo withers
away. Concrete evidence of student apathy was exemplified
in the decision not to hold the Student Council nominating
convention. The decision is the result and acknowledgement
of the fact that there is little student interest in a posi-
tion of leadership and little desire to serve the college com-
munity. Why is this so?

Each of these offices SC president, S&B editor and
Cyclone editor 7 makes great demands on the student hold-
ing it. There is a tremendous expenditure of time involved
m the result of which may be a drop in grades and the
amount of personal freedom of the individual. A high de-
gree of personal responsibility is expected which in many
cases requires a lot of growing up fast. The persons holding
these offices are inevitably subject to the criticism, and
frequently the censure, of every member of the college
community. Each of these individuals has to cope with the
problem of student apathy, administrative balkiness, and
faculty inertia. This demands both patience and tenacity.
In short, these positions involve a high degree of the sub«
ordination of the personal life of the individual to the com»
munal role which he has assumed.

But the rewards are inestimably greater than the
drawbacks, for the individual grows through the experience
and helps the college to grow.

He has an opportunity to see his ideas tested, and if
good, become realities. He has the opportunity to take the
college one step closer to the ideal. He has an opportunity
to know the college as few others know it. And he has an
opportunity to develop his personality and character in a

_ way open to few‘

We~ yak continuously about giving students increased
responsrbilities, and the faculty and administration are
skeptical of our capacity to handle them. Until we show
our Willingness to accept the limited responsibilities offered
to us now, we can’t expect and don’t deserve more.

‘ The Sound
and
The Fury

by .Ai‘l. Travers

There was an item in last
week‘s 5&3 to the effect that
Mr. Norton would take over
Mr. Hawk’s duties while the
latter is on vacation. This means
that Mr. Norton is the actlng
dean acting as acting president
for the acting president. Wlm
all this acting, someone should
get an Oscar.

I heard a nasty rumor the
other day that “Strangers in
Our Midst” would soon be (US?
continued. This is a great pity
since it only mok up the bet-
ter part of a page and everyone
I know waited breathle - r for
each succeeding ihstallmen’: and
hung on every word uhll: the)
figured it out. It will probably
be replaced by something like
a faculty corner. Fare tliee well.

4 l :

Post moi-tern. ‘dept. The thanks-
giving vacation has gone the
way of all extra vacations, and
for the usual reason. It seems
'llat in order for Grinnell to
be recognized as an accredited
college there must he a given
number of class meetings. (All
right, so you knew ml already,
but remember we’ve gar. 12 new
Studenvs.) If we are given this
vacation we must start school
earlier or get out later or give
up part of some existing vaca-
tion. This means that college
employees must be kept on two
more days than now, This in-
volves money. (You know what
money is. You waited in line
for twenty minutes to give ‘a
wad of it to the college.) But
if I may make a suggestion,
this can be worked out.

It means forsaking victory
day. Victory day does not oc-
cur until Hamming (and
sometimes not until we win)
This would be close enough
to Thanksgiving for the more
hardy souls to hold out till
then. (The weaker ones who
run smack in the intervening
period are not up to the lofty
Grinnell Standard anyway.)
But even with this there is
one more day to consider,

We find this day in the New
Student Days area. I arrived
here one week before the up-
perclassmen when l was a
freshman. Grinnell living had
not yet been keyed to its usual
dynamic peak. It doesn’t really
give a true picture of Grinnell
living. (For one thing they put
that crucial last ingredient in
the Syrup which makes it taste
like real maple instead of var-
nish.) I believe this period
could be shortened one day. Of
Course it may decrease the
number of mixed dinners by
one. 01' mean that the Student
Council picnic would have to be

postponed, but these things may
be forgotten in the signficance
of the consequences.
Furthermore the foods de-
partment might actually save
money since this vacation
would be somewhat p: a se-
mester break in nature. And
you paid for all those meals
you didn‘t eat over semesters.

(Besides if they get enough

money, it may forestall'prune

whip for another year. 1954-55
is an off-year for prune whip

anyway.)

The remaining New Student
Days should serve the purpose
of brainwashing the women
and dolhg all those various and
sundry things which build men
from children. Think about this
for a while. It might work.
