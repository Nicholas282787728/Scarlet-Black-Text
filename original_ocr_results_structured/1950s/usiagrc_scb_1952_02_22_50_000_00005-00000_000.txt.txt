Grinnell athletes came through all the way aroundl
last weekend when they defeated the Knox wrestling,
swimming, and basketball teams at Galesburg, Ill.

The triple lacing was highlighted by a thrilling 49—47

victory on the basketball court Saturday night. Avenging‘

an earlier beating the Pionee

rs stalled for six and one-half

minutes to edge the second place Siwashers.

The first three quarters looked
like the same old Grinnell story,
Trailing -by three points at the
half, the Pioneers put on a
drive and found themselves in
possession of a 39.37 lead gov
ing into the fourth period.

When the final gun went on.
the Pioneers walked off the floor
still in possession of a 49.47
lead, a lead which had been held
through six and one half min-
utes of a hard pressing Knox
defense, The Siwashcrs got the
ball twice during that period.
but failed to score both times.

Netting 14 first half points,
big Bob Winter led the Grins
nell attack with 21 markers
on eight buckets and five free
throws/Not far behind was

Dave stumhaugh, who hit
five well—spaced field goals
and added three tree throws
for 13 points. All-conference
Berk Johnson led the Knox
attack with 17 markers.

However, it wasn’t the big
scoring guns that paved the way
for the victory. That long, drawn
out stall was the key to the vice
tory. Bob Dibble, who contribut-
cd some outstanding rebounding,
Hartley Bond, with one marker,
and Tom Railsback, with four,
were the boys who did the lions
share of hanging on to the ball

That defeat was only the secs

0nd league loss of the Siwash¥

ers, who hold down second place
in the conference with a six and
two record.

Earlier in the day Grinncll

over the Knox swimmers 50.43,
The win boosts the Pioneer con.
ference record to 2.1 for the
year.

Barry Lawrence, sophomore
free styler, broke another rec—
ord in his specialty, the 450
free style. His mark was a
cool 5:37.51 for the ten lengths
distance of the new Knox 25
yard pool.

Although Lawrence fell ten
seconds short of his all time
record for the event, his time
was good enough to break the
Knox pool mark of six minutes.
He also swam the free style

stint of four laps in the follow— .

ing 400 yard relay, "and set
another record in the 225 free
style. '
