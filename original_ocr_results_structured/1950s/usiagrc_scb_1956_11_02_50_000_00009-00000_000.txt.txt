Cornell Blasts
Varsity 28-13

Grinnell’s Pioneers, as yet
winlcss, succumbcd to a strong
Cornell team, 23.13, last Satur»
day beforc a capacity Homer
coining crowd at Ash Park.

The Pioneers looked powerful
at limes, but defensive lapses
aided the Rams at Various points

in the game. The loss was the
fifth straight for Grinnell, and
places the hapless Pioneers at
the bottom of the conference
race“

The ﬁrst half quickly de»
veloped into a de:ensivc bat—
tle with neither team pcne~
trating the otlier's defense,
until late in the second quar—
ter when Cornells ablc quar—
terback, Bob Keck, completed
a pair of long passes. With
only seconds remaining before
the first half was history,
Grinnell quarterback Steve
Bauserman and Jack Schaiicr
combined on a 74.yard pass
play to knot the count at 7.7.

The final half was dominated
by the Rams. chk's pinrpoinl
passing moved the count to 14.7
by the end of the third period,
and early in the final canto
another long aerial shoved Coi»
ncll in front by a 21—7 margin.
0n the following kickoff, an
alert Cornell playcr hopped on
a free ball deep in Pioncci- tcr—
riloiy quickly leading to Cal»
nclls last scoimg\etfort ot the
afternoon

However, the Pioneers, still
hustling, cut the margin to
23713 in the closing seconds

on a beautifully executed pass .‘

play from Jim Burkctt to
George Suscns, which netted
till yards and six points.

“We‘ll

be up for the game,"
said iunior guard John Ol'se
born '“Though Knox is expect
ed to be (warlouchdown favor-
ites, I think that it we play real
good football we can beat
ihcin."

Mainstay and co-captam John
Larcw has virtually hcld togeth—

er the seveneman line on are
fcnsc, and is one of the rough—
ast defensive men in the wafer-
ei c. He is counted on as the
important link in a chain bent
to stop Knox’s powerful running
attack before it gets a chance
to break loose.

Captaining the team this
season with Larcw is 5'7" Dick
Thomas. “Hawk" has been
playing at the end position on
both offense and defense. Sur»
prisingiy small for an end,
yet as tough as they come on
defense, Thomas has been a
standout athlete since he join»
ed the varsity and is counting
on a win tomorrow.

In liopcs of upsetting the Si-
washers, coaches Peterson and
Arch Unruh did away with m0-
vies last Monday to devote more
tim: to actual practice. The
Pioni‘cl’s will have to halt Knox

fullbi .\ Lopez to win the ball

game.

To lend a hand in stopping
this . .ashing back will bc ver—
satile Darrell Fisher who has
playctl center on offense, liner
backcr on dclcnsc and guard
and tackle on both. The husky
blond transieircd to Grinnell
last year, lettered and is now
depended upon heavily.

Gordie Loucks was hurt on
Parcnts’ day and probably
won't be ready for Knox. rho
“fiery” littlo defensive back
bruised his shoulder early in
the Carleton game.

Haifbacks Sam Petroff and
Scotty Walker have played var-
sity ball for three years. They
tied for team leadership in
ground gaining last season with
a mark over 500. Potroff has
done a great deal ol the team's
kicking in the past three years.

And in one of the end slots
Saturday will be Bob Clem,
This lanky senior is in his seer
ond year here, has been rotate
mg between the first two teams
all season. He's fast and an
agile ball player.

Dependable reserve Brad Sa-
gen rounds out the list of son-
iois who will be on the field to
n rrow. Sagcn is also in his
third term as a varsity football
player.
