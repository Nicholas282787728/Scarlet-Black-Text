The active opposition of the
iorincr group was, activated
on May 17, 1954, with the Sun
preme Court's decision that
the concept oi “separate but
equal” has no placc in educa-
tion. Chici Justicc Earl Wars
ren, speaking tor a unanimous
court, declared th t ”separate
educational iacii s are his
liercntly unequal." This state
ment marked a clear reversal
ur attitude towards the 58-
yearsold Plessy ruling under
which 17 states and the Dis—
trict 0( Columbia had main-
tained separate schools ior

A year later on May 31, 1955.
the Supreme Court charged the

cation is beside the point. The
tact is that nobody cares wheth—
cr we have a KGRW or not.

The Student Council‘s posi-
tion is obvious enough: they
have. poured so much money
into the KG ratholc that they
can't stop now. They must put
the station on the air or make
public tools at themselves

And yet, would this be so

also says that “it states have

the court's decision midi

October 24, l953

Random thoughts . ..

. come into our hcaci every so ottcn, none long enough to
merit a lull editorial, but cach dcscrving some comment Among
these

1. Sing hol tor the Public events committee and its proposed
iaculty lectures on ,thc various holds of specialization. May we
suggest that the emphasis in thcsc lectures be directed tow- d
the basic correlations and unifying principles ot the various tlls<
Clpllnes’ This comprehensive grasp oi knowledge-is, we lccl, lack-

ing on this campus—perhaps 2| general humanities course is the
answer?

2 The Student Council luster! wisely, we think, in granting
salaries to KGRW heads Whether the station itself is worth any-
thing is not for us to decide here. The capital investment, how~
\cvei', has been made. KG will obviously never be the “voice of
Grlnnell College” if it is not led by a capable staff. To insure
our investment in the station, we must also insure the capability
of the men to whom the station is entrusted,

3, And while we are on the Student Council, We do approve oi
the constitutional change allowing more tlexibtlity in the date at
convention, Might it not also be wise, however. to insure consti»

tutionally that the SC elecion proceeds C of HP and AWS Board
nominations?

4, Another wisc change in campus elections—although in a
dittcrent areaahas been the Honor 6': reviston oi the method of'
nominating and electing the Homecoming Queen. in the past, when
girls were nominated by the individual halls, the selection seem<
cd to narrow down to ta.) a popularity contest among the girls

dating in the hall and tb.) a contest between the male “spon~
sors" ot thc girls.

_ _5. As a parting shot, may we urge that we be given a Thanks»
giving vacation that allows us to go home tor the holidays? Some—
where, in the upper stratosphere or campus control, someone
seems to feel that leaving the campus is, of itself, a mistake. After
all, there are those who enioy themselves more elsewhere, shock-
ing as it mxy Seeml
