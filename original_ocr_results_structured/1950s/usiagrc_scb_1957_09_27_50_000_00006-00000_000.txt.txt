Gridmen Prepare For Lawrence;
Take To Road Following Lay Off

No game this week Lawrence
is the next contest, and it’s at
Appleton, Wis Practice this
week has been one of heavy
work in preparation tor the
vikings.

Lawrence is one of the biggest
games of the season to the
Grinnell team for several rea
sons.

First, the Vikings have
a smaller team than .we,
and they lack the experienced
depth of the Pioneers. Second,
they also use the single-wing
oﬂense and have in the past
produced powerhouses. In the
third place the Lawrence
game will have a great psy-
chological eﬂect on the rest
of the season.

The Grinnell team has not
let up because of the loss to
Coe, but has worked very hard
so far this week. Practice has
been heavy, thorough and bene-
ﬁcial. The team members look—
ed at the ﬁlms of the last
game on Monday and saw what
mistakes they, as individuals
and as a squad, made, Since
that time they have worked
seriously at improving them.

The football season is two
Weeks away from Grinnell as
far as actual Competition is Conr
Cerned. The varsity has this
Saturday off (one team in the
eonterence lr idle each week
due to the odd number of
schools) and will play its next
game at Lawrence.

So Pioneer sports fans will
have to settle for a track
meet tomorrow. To many,
such is an unexciting adair,
to others it’s even a “waste
or time."

However, in spite of the ap-
parent disinterest among col-
lege students toward cross-
country events, this sport,
among the most gruelling of all
sports, continues to ﬁnd its
place on a great majority oi
interscholastic schedules. Why?

Does this suggest that there
might be something more to an
athlete’s desire for competition
than what’s accorded him in the
way of esteem, prestige or popu-
larity (often noted as the only
reason one participates at all)?
I think so.

A cross-country runner cov-
ers two or three miles (de-
pending on the course) at
something close to “all-out"
speeds. He does so before no
crowd, 0:321: in near privacy.
He does 50 knowing that his
teat will go practically, it not

‘ wholly, unnoticed. Why, then,

Will he run?

Cross-country serves to illus-
trate the fact that there is more

“INTESTINAL FORTITUDE"
—a preponderant drive to
achieve perleetion. More im-
portant thzm the crowd’s reac-
tion, to a real athlete, is the
desire to set for himsell a
challenging goal-and to meet it.

The observer who looks at
sports only from a spectator's
angle can see little validity in
this reasoning, and is there-.
fore reluctant to appreciate the
athlete‘s point of view, throw-
ing it of: as an “excuse" to
gain recognition. This attitude
is entertained by a large num-
ber of collegians here, as well
as in the Big Ten, Big Seven
or ivy League, and periodically
needs refute.

The cross-country season
provides an opportunity for
such refutation because here-
in lies proof or the'idca that
“glory" is secondary, it not
ceded lower, in the eyes of a
true athlete.

Walden, Yoak, Necvel, msser,
