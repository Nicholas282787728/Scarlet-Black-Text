Free Advice

To Future Members of the Administration:

When on first or vo zit Grinnell, don’t beat around
the bush ou talk to students, let them know what your
policy' is gel to be and let them walk away rssulell, linou's
ing where the stand.

Don’t cl ti 26 student government \litholit ridding
constructive criticism. Never speak about such thing's with
out realizing that not ollly does this reflect on your judge—
ment, but on the rest of the administration as well. If you
feel that there is something wrong with one of our branches
of student government, don’t speak to small groups of
“friends.” Go to the governmental group and present what
is wrong and what you feel can be done about it.

Remember also that this is a student g' up, rlln by
and for the students. There are places where, ' you speak,
action must be taken. But, it is not that way in our student
governing groups. If you grant these groups control
over certain rules and regulations, then do not take it away
unless you can show just cause.

You are ohxllibition for the students so that they
may model themselves, at least partially, after your charac-
ter. Don’t make a fool of yourself in student meeting
places where words can so easily be carried. And never
slam a student who is just doing his job.

In conclusion, don't try “psychology" on students.
Because they too have brains, they think you will not be so

ToﬂIeSkB:

After seriously considering a
problem of vital interest to the
student body, the men of Smith
hall wish to make their posi-
tion known to ihcir fellow siud.
ents.

We feel that it is not fitting
for an educational institution
such as Grinneil to send out
into society persons who are
morally unfit. This is not keep-
ing our trust to society, to the
college, or to the vast majority
of honest, hardworking slud-
ems. However, college policy in
the past has allowed just this
situation to exist. Persons who
habitually cheat have not been
disciplined In any way and have
received their diplomas along
with other Grinnell graduates.
This has served only to checpen
the Grinnell diploma

We in Smith hall generally
agree that Grinnell should some
clay have an honor system. now-
ever, we feel that to institute
an honor sysicm without first
eliminating as much wholesale
cheating as possible would be
highly impractical. '

We feel that habitual cheat-
ing can best be eliminated by
esidblishi-ng and enforcing the
following practices:

1. iAny student who cheats
on an examination should re-
ceive .a failure in the course.

2. No teacher should give
the same examination more
than once. i

a. Mimcographcd tests make
cheating pasy and should be
avoided unless adequate steps
arc taken to make sure they
are not stolen beforehand or
.passed ion to other sections of
the course.

4. Tests should he kept
somewhere other than in the
.fac'ulty offices.

5. Examinations which do
not ,cdoqoaicly test a student‘s
knowledge oncourngc many
otherwise honest students lo
cheat. ncporimcnis which
give such examinations should
chuugc itheir testing methods

3. Term papers should be
checked to make sure they
arc the student's own work.

This docs not mean that the
faculty alone should be respon-
sible for stepping cheating-
Students should be willing to
do their share by changing their
whole attitude toward cheatin‘g

ferd

and showing strong disapproval
of both cheating in general and
cheaters as individuals. Until
the student body is willing to
do its share, there will be no
substantial change in the pre-
sent situation.

We, therefore. feel that, until
some firm action is taken by
both students and administrm
tion to put an end to cheating,
Grinnell will not be satisfactor-
ily fulfilling is function of pro-
ducing high quality leaders for
tomorrow’s world.

The Men of Smith Hall

To the editor:

1 have always been under the
impression that discretion and
self-restraint ' were primary
qualities of persons in high sd-
ministrative oifices, especially at
Grinnell College. But appar
ently even the most revered
lose their heads occasionally,
However, it does not seem to
me that the student union is
an appropriate .place for such
disGrsccful displays as it was
last week.

Public condemnation of any
person or hall, which is not en-
tirely warranted. must not be
condoned. Nor should profanity
be directed at any person or
ball, particularly from one who
should be commanding the re-
speci of all the students.

Such public censure demands
a public apology, both to the
men of North Younkcr (a hall
which I do not ardently admire)
and to the house president of
that hall {a person with whom
I am not acquainted.)

1 trust that the Alien and
Sedition Acis have not been re-
enacted.

Respectfully,

There appears in this issue a
loticr from the mcn olSmlth re-
garding the chcapmg problem at
Grinnell it is, perhaps. sulper-
rluous to say that the chcuicr
noL only hu s himself but he
betrays the prisons paying his
\ y to school, his fellow studs
oils, and the college. It is ““7
portsnl. hoivcvcr. that this fact
is not mislnyod in the pile of
rcnflicling opinions,

Thr men of Smith have made
several excellent suggestions to
the faculty lf clicnling is to be
cradlculed nl Grinucii the loc-
ulty \thl hm-c to share their
pal-i ol the burden

This, lhey have not clone as
well as lhcy could. These sug
gestions should Show them sew
oral ways that they can improve
lhelr attludcs and practices.

The students have their part
to play in this too, and shovr
ing it all on the shoulders of
the faculty is an easy way to
avoid the responsibility, and
ibrmgs us to the question of an
Honor System

There used to be an Honor
System here at Grihnell and it
was dismrded because returning
veterans did not want it, It did
not fail to do its job.

The basic argument against an
Honor System is, ”I don't want
to rat on my buddy. It’s his
business.” It’s not his business.
You, the student are adversely
affected by unethical practices
on the part of the cheater. In
the firsi place the class curve
is raised making it more harsh
on the student who played the
game fairly. In many cases it
will lower the grade of the hone
est student. In the long run it
will cheapen the Grinnell di-
ploma which the honest student
has lallbored four years to
achieve.

It boils down to a question of
values, Valuing the friendship
of a cheater over the calibre of
your diploma is irrational to say
the least.

We are not as far from an
Honor System as some people
think, Cheating has been open-
ly denounced by aroused stud-
ents and the prdblem squarely
confronts them. It is too Late to
turn away. Next issue I’ll con-
tinue this and present the basic
set-up of a good Honor System.

To iﬂle editor

I was very much disappoinc-
ed to hear during this last week
fellow siudcnls responding to
my question, “What do you
think of the Gates lectures?",
with the answer, “I only heard
the first one” or “I couldn't go,
i had a test on Tuesday," etc.
, Seemingly this indicates a
certain dichotomy of opinion on
the part of some members of
the faculty as to just what is
included in a liberal arts edu-

ly following these series they
are defeating the very purpose
for which they were established,
1 recognize the possibility that
religion as subject matter may
not have interest and appeal
universally to either students or
faculty, but even that is not
reason enough for denying to
those who wish to attend that
privrledge,

Dr. Sittler is not only a
preacher talking about Chris-
tian ethics, he is a very scholar-
ly man whose ability to coins
munlcate is not readily rivaled
even on Grinnell's campus,
Here is a man who is so ire-
sponsrble cor his expression and
thought that he composes his
sentences with the precision of
a Swiss jowelcr. HAS every word
is deliberately chosen to out

clean. clear concise psiierns of

meaningful thought. It so sel-
dom that the average student is
confronted with this degree of
responsibility that he should be
given every opportunity to
avail himself of this kind of
experience,

iSccondly, 1 wish to point out
that this manner in which Dr.
simer challenges one of critical
thought, which I believe is the
essence of intellectual integrity,
is something which his his
audience so forcefully as to re-
awaken many passive minds.
Even without consideration of
his subject matter, 1 believe
these two qualities alone qualify
the attendance of such an event,
for these two characteristics are
the hallmarks of a trained
mind, an educated person.
