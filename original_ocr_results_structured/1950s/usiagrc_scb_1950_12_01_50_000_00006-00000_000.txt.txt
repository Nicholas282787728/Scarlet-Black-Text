Markevii‘ch Plays Versaiile Prclgram

but also by the words of God,"i
said Dr. Pauck. He called to at.
tention the temptation of Jesus
in which He stilled His hunger
and proved Himself a life bring-i
er.

Faust sold his soul to (her
dCVll to gain power, continued
Fauck, but Faust eventually
collapsed, This part of his‘
speech was especially pertinent

lworld today, “Man should reach.
,oiit toward the world but not to
dominate,” concluded Dr, Paucka
Man must live with a spirit otu
submission to God for “he that
looseth his life for My sake
,shall find it".
