Opera Players Present Encore
Of‘Menotti's Work, ‘The Medium'

by Judie neget '

A repeat performance ot the
Opera Workshops production or
Gian Carlo Menott' "The Med~

’ will be given tomorrow
:night at 8:30 pm. in the High
School Auditorium. The cast,
directed» by Duane Crossley
(music) and student Charles
' Haynes, includes Madame Flora
(Baha), Karen Kalin; Monica,
Marcia Madden; Toby, the mute,
Scotty Walker; Mrs. Nolan.
Nancy Coe; Mrs. Gohineau, Nan-
cy Hunter. Mr. Gobineau, Al
Kcllar; and, the hidden voice,
Janice Peterson. Shirley Spcel-
man is the accompanist. ,

“The Medium», is the tragr
eliy rot a woman caught he-
‘tween two worlds; a world oi
reality which she cannot
wholly comprehend, and a
supernatural world in which
shc cannot believe. Karen Ka-
lin. as Dalia, the Medium.
gir'res what is considered hy
‘nll viewers as her hcst per»
iormance on the Grinnell
stage. Those who saw Karen

in “The Old Maid and the

Thief". and “Yeoman or the
Guard" will he pleased to see
that her talent‘has reached

axle of its high paints in this'

production. Her total immer-
sion in the role sometimes lets
her‘,emotions over—run hcr vii-
cal control, hut perhaps it is
hotter in this (ype'of work
to pay special-attention to the
acting. Most notahle is her
solilociuy in theisecond act;

Highlights of the Com—
mencement weekend include
the Baccalaureate tonight at
8 p.m. in Herrick chapel with

‘ the Rev. Judson E. Fiebigel',

superintendent of the Cone
gregntional Christian Cons

' l'eljelice .of Iowa, as speaker.

Commencement

events began Thursday with
the annual Hill contests in
speaking and singing in Her—

' rick chapel. A» l'ecol‘dbl‘eaking

she ‘hrings a matureness’ andw
depth to the part that is
rarely seen in student perfor-
mances.

Another pcrlormer in "The
Medium" who was seen in .two
previous graduation week shows
is Marcia Madden. ln her por—
trayel. at Monica she almost
completely breaks away from
the “grand manner" stylc oi act-
in; she has tended to fall back
on before. l-lei- movement. :11»
ways skilliul; has been cut
down to the necessary minimum,
and adds much to her acting
as the young daughter or the
Medium. Her voice seems to he
more under control and her en-
unciation is such that none or
Menottl's poetry is lost to the
listener. Like Karen,
tends to become a hit oo sub-
jective about the character, but
she has made a great step to-
ward becoming a really good
actrcss through the approach
she has taken to this role.

Scotty Walker, seen as the
First Yeoman in ”Ycoinan~ot
“the Guard” last year, is excels
lent as Toby. His face manages
,to convey more than any words
Menotti might havc considered
putting in the character's mo’utli.
He makes he s‘cencs with Muri-
ica lyrical and v_el'y memorable,
Considering that‘ this is only
Scotty's t d piece or work on
the stage, he shows a natural
capacity for fine work in the
theatre that has not been seen
around here tor a long time.
