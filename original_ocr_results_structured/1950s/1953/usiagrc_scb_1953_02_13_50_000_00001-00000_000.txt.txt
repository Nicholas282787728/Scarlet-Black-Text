It’s do or die for Coach
John Pfitsch‘s record-busting
cagers when Grinnell meets
league—leading Carleton l'n
Darby gym tonight at 8 pm.

This is the big one fOl‘ the
Scarlet and Black, A defeat
by the Curls will put the
Pioneers out of the champ—
ionship fight for good, A will
will knot the race into a three-
way scramble for first between
Grinnell, Carleton and Cornell,

Both Grinnell and Cornell
have lost two games, while the
Carleton cagers have dropped
only one to Monmouth on the
Scots court, and now have a
slim hold on first place with a
five and one record, The Pit)—
neers have dropped two games
while winning five.

The Pfitschmen have one big
advantage in this second meet-
ing of the two cluhS—-l.liey will
be playing before a home
crowd. that has not seen them
lose once on the Darby floor
in six games this season.

But Coach Mel Taube's team
has a feather in its hat, too.‘ The
Knights beat the Pioneers at
Carleton on the first weekend
of conference play, 69»53, That
contest was knotted u"p at 43-
all midway in the third quarter
when the Pioneers suddenly col-
lapsed.

Since then the Grinnell five
has improved with every game,
gaining confidence and an im-
pressive record, climaxed by its
spectacular 101432 triumph over
Monmouth last Saturday which
broke the all-time Grinnell col»
lege scoring record.

Big Bob winter is firmly en-
trenched in the runnerup spot
in individual conference scoring.
with 24,1 points per game, and
sophomore Dick von Maui- has
zoomed to 15th spot and a 13
point average from 25th in the.
league.

But it will take more than
these two boys to knock the
Carls out of the coveted top
spot. Only a perfectly coordine
atcd Pioneer squad can hope
to edge the well balanced,
smooth running Knight crew,
which is led by two sophomore
all-conference guards, Howie
ltosenblum and Laurie Slocum.

These two boys together have
a 233 game average, and this
added to the sensational per-
formance of another sophomore,
forward Bob Buis, spells nothing
but trouble for Grinnell hopes,
Buis currently holds down sixth
place in Midwest scoring with
a 16.8 point average.

At the center will be Elton
Brooks, 6 ft. 6 in, who hails
from Winter’s home town of
Cedar Rapids and last game
held Big Bob to ten points—the
only time that winter has scored
less than 20 markers in a con-
ferencg game this season .

Bob Richardson or Dick Lar-
son wrll man the remaining for-
ward slot for the Knights.

l

For Grinnell, senior Dave
Stumbaugh will start opposite
von Maur at forward, and Bud
Crawl, sophomore, will team
with senior Doc Dibble at the
guard positions.

The Pioneers have their job
out out for them. If they play
the kind of basketball they are
capable of playing they can win,
if they don’t—it’s going to be
a rough evening.
