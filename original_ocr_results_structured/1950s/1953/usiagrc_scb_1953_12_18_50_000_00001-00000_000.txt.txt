Grinnell Police
En’rer Search

For Union TV

The apparent theft of the une
ion television set was reported
to the Grlnnell police depart
ment Wednesday afternoon.
Chief Waldo Johnson said yester»
day. .

Chief Johnson had nothingl
definite to report on the search
except that he should have traced
the serial number of the set by
today, Until he has determined
the number of the set the only
identification possible is by make
and model, supplied by a repair-i
man who worked on it.

The set was apparently stolen
last Friday night, and was nor.
ticed to be missing on Saturday‘
morning. Dean of Men Henry A.
Brown said that it was not until
Monday morning that he learned
that the set was not being re-
paired, Norman Marble, super-l
intendent of buildings and
grounds, reported the fact nftel"
checking all the repair shops in;
Grinneli.

Chief Johnson said he was’
considering the possibility that‘
the thief had simply carried the
set from the TV room in the
union on Friday evening dis-
guised as a repairman.

He stated that the town re-
pairman who had worked on the
set said that it wouldhave been
dirficult for one man to have
carried it off alone.

The set was worth about $400
when new, and its estimated
present value is about $200.

ded Cost, $1.25

Students who have purchased
a 1954 Cyclone will have to pay
an additional $1.25 for the year
book, business manager Ed Ling
announced Tuesday.

This payment is in addition
to the\ two dollars paid at the
time the order was made by
each student, and must be paid
before January 22, Ling said.
Ater January 22 the additional
cost will be $1.50, which must
be paid betore January 30 or
the order will be cancelled and
the deposit forfeited.

Ling said that the payments
were necessary because under
the printing contract $3,600
must be on hand before Feb-
ruary 1 to make a payment
on the printing cost,
The Cyclone office
open from 4 to 5 pm. Monday
through Fridays during January
to take the additional payments.
“I am terribly. sorry that
these steps are necessary," Ling
said. “We, and you, have been
‘let down’ by responsible perr
sonsin the college.

“But we will work on as
planned, to bring out the best
book possible.”

Ling apparently referred to
the semester fee allocation of
$1,200 in his reference to be-
ing "let down." The Cyclone
had asked for 82,060 from
the fee, and had based its
budget on receiving that
amount.

The direct cost of the book
will be $3.25 per student this
year, $1.75 less than in previous
years when no semester fee
allocation was made to the
annual.

 

l2% of Sem Fee Uncollecled:
Distribution Cui AccoEiingl’y V

The treasurer's office an—
nounced this week that it
would not be able to distribute
the full semester fee for this
semester at the present time be-
cause it had collected only a
little over 88% of the fee.

Treasurer Rupert Hawk and
controller Norrie Neveln said
that they were planning to dis-
tribute what money bad been
collected in the proportions de—
signated by the semester fee al-
lotment which was approved
Last Week by the faculty.

Normally, they said, organi-
zations would receive the full
amount allocated immediately

because the 20 percent reserve
could be used in immediate
disbursals of money. This year,
however, there is no reserve and
they cannot distribute money
which they do not have.

The money which has .not
been collected is from students
who are working their way
through school or are attending
on student loans.

Therefore, .they said, they
would distribute what they
could now, and then make sup-
plementary distributions at the
beginning of the second sem-
ester, at Spring vacation, and at
the end of the year,

Payments from students who
are paying in installments are
applied first to tuition charges,
then to room and board charges,
and lastly “to Student fees such
as the semester fee and the so-
cial fee, they said.

They estimated that it would

“Spring Comes to bughouse

Square” by Al Harrison, Clark
junior, was chosen from two

lscnpls entered for the student

musical production at a meet-
ing held by the script,reading
committee on Tuesday night.

The members of'the commit-
tee which selected the script are:
John Springer, director of the
music; Tat Dowlircg, Cowles
junior; Patty Marshall, Loose
hall senior; Carl Runge,‘ Cowles

an senior; Kitten Arveson, James
junior; Polly Hallett, Loose lhall

lor. ' '

The winning script tells the
story of "Bughouse Fred” and
his traveling players who pre—
sent 4 skits. The first is a parody
on Shakespearean tragedy. The
second ‘is based on the standard
western melodrama. "A pure and
simple” love story is the t'heme
of the third, and- the last re:
presents the dream of a son of
fame.

Al Harrison, the writer, says
”It's a place where almost any
Grinnell student might wind up,
though we prefer to think we’ll
.all do better than that; maybe
even, we‘ll wind lip as members
of Rughouse Fred’s wanderin’
players. The Bug House does not
refer to Chicago or any other
particular lownvit’s Eughouse
square in any city.”

Marcia Madden, James Junior,
is_ writing the music and Jim
Floss the lyrics. The finished
script, music, and lyrics will be
done by the end of the semester.

Haynes, north Younker sopho-
more, was the other script con-
sidered‘, It is a mythical history

sent time, through the “Gay
