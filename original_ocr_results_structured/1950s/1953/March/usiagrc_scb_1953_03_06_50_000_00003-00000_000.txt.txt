lUnion Grill To Be Open Nightly

Until Fire Damage ls Repaired

The student union grill will
be open seven nights a week

until the damages done by last
Sunday's fire are repaired. This

was
Nollie
foods.
Previously, the grill had
been closed on Saturday nights.

Miss Gleason said that the
union jukebox and some iur-
niture had been moved into
the special dining room ad-
joining the grill, because the
union lounge proper is being
temporarily used jar oiiioc
space by the AFROTC.

She explained that if the ad
ditional grill dining room is

annonced Wednesday by
Gleason, director of

Vopened, as it will be new, the

"rill must be, also. So, in order

to have this room Available for

a lounge, the temporary change
was made.

She said that grill director
Mrs. Stevens and her new em-
ployees (this does not include
student labor) had volunteered
to work the extra day per week
without extra pay until the

iunion is repaired, which prob-

ably will be by the end of

change is planned,
Miss Gleason declared.
1n explaining why the change
is only temporary, Miss Glea-
son said that Mrs, Stevens and
her Staff are entitled to have
one day a week off work. In
the past. Saturday n‘ghts have
usually been the day ior
dancs and other all~college ac.
tivities, thus substantially T21
ducing the number of cuszo»
mare and therefore being the
best night to close. s

The day staﬁf takes Sunday
off, because a late breakfast is
served in the dormitory diningi,
rooms, Miss Gleason continued.

The amount required to
hit-o an additional stall for
these “days off” Wnuld not be
covered by the additional
revenue earned by the sale
of food during these times,
she declared. All grill em-
ployees' salaries and wages
are paid by this revenue.

A preference vote has been
planned for housemeetings to
determine if popular opinion
would favor pennanently

however,

,lntegrity."
