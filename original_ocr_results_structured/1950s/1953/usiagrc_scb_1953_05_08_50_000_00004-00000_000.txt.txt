Nearly everyone has heard of
Hogan and Snead in connection
with golf. Anotllor “mechanical
man” to the golf world, at least
the Grinnell College g’olf world,
is a Langan senior by the name
of William Lazier.

Bill got his start in golf tourn-

aments playing for Sioux City

Central High

School. He play

ed in a couple

of local tourn-

aments along

., with his school

matches. His

first year at

Grinnell, Bill

played with the

Langan team

which placed

first that year

in intra-murals.

Since his

freshman year

Bill has played varsity golf for

‘Grinnell. This year he has

earned his third Honor G

letter award in that sport. His

varsity record for these three

years of golf has earned him

the praise of exscoach Hank

Brown and present coach Bob

Peterson. Each seem to echo

pretty much the same kind of

summary of ”big" Bill. To

quote, for example. coach

Peterson: “Bill stays up there

all the time~the most consist.

ent squad member this year as
well as last."

To prove his point, last Tuess

day against Cornell, Bill shot

a 77 in the rain to be medalist

for the day.
This is the last year of golf

SCARLET AND BLACK

for Bill. After his June grad-
uation, Bill has a date with the
Air Force at Denver, and a
couple of years later when he
returns he'll head for graduate
school. But goli is a hobby he
wants to stick with.

if anybody can turn the trick
at this year's conference meet
in favor of Grinnell, Mr. “Con-
sistent" Lazier is the man to
watch. And as for Bill. maybe
actions speak louder than words.
ior all he will say is “Well I'll
be trying"
