since 1902, has done the greater:
part of his work in Caliiornia.'

He was the tirst photographer

the famoiis Mexican painter,
Siqueiros, became acquainted
with his photographs. !

Siqueiros wrote of Weston's
work, “In Weston's photographs
the texture, the physical qual-
ity of things is rendered with
the utmost exactness . . . The
things have a definite propor-

in clearly defined distance one
from another."
