CHESTERFIELD

IS THE LARGEST SELLING CIGARETTE
IN AMERICA'S COLLEGES . . .

 

by 3.1953 survey audit of actual sales in more
than 800_ college co—ops and campus stores
from coast to coast. Yes, for the‘ ﬁfth straight
year Chesterﬁeld is the college favorite.

 

 

CHESTERFIELD IS THE ONLY
CIGARETTE EVER TO GIVE YOU PROOF
OF lﬂv NICOTINE, HIGHEST QUALITY

 

 

 

 

The country"s six leading brands were ana-
ly’zed—chemically—and Chesterfield was found
low in nicotine—highest in quality.

This scene reproduced from Chesterfield's
famous‘ center spread” line up pages in
college football programs from coast to coast.
