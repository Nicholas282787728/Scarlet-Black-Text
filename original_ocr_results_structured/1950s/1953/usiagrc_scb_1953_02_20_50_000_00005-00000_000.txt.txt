Cagers Smash Coir-[tawny Attire fit

by Ron stanger

When the gun sounded ending
the CzrlEtoll-Gl‘innell tilt last
Friday, there couldn‘t have been
the slightest doubt in the mind

of anyone passing by who had‘

won the contest.

The din was something that
hadn't been heard in Darhy gym
for a long, long time.

The victorious Grinncll players
immediately carried coach John
Pfltsch off the tloor, through the
pressing fans, on their shoulders
into the dressing rooms.

At the other end of the gym
Carleton cagers u-earily picked
up their warm-up suits and

' headed town‘rd the' showers
They were the losers by the
score of 9045. The Pioneers
had tumbled the league lenders
into third places.

In the locker room the Grin-
nellians had every right to he
juhilant. Not only did they
knock the Knights from top
perch and keep themselves in
the conference race, but also des

. feated the Minnesota eagers for
the first time in more than three

, years. Their last victory came on; ,

Jan. 21, 1950, by 67»54.
Leading the team was Bud
orowl who. olayed the best
all—around game of his short
college career as he tossed in
11 field goals for a 61.2 per-
centage mark and sucesslully ,
shot his lone free throw at-

tempt for a game total of 23

points. ,

Then came Boh winter. Dick
von Moor, and Dave Stumhaugh
with 19, 13, and 13 points re-
spectiveiy.

As a team, Grinnelt hit on 45
percent of its field goal tries andl
74 percent of the charity throws.

The contest began with a
i bang as the Grinnellinhs pour»
i ed in eight points with goals
i by winter, stumbaugh, Crawl,

,and nibble to move ahead 5-5.
. Seemingly unable to miss, the
Pfitsehnien confidently drove 24
points home by the quarter mark
and out rebounded the carls by
wide margin.

The fans cheered louder and
he Pioneers worked harder.

ith every basket the bench-

varmers jumped up yelling
iidly, almost dashing on the
-loor en masse in their enthu-
iasm. At the half Grinnell had
xttended its edge to 4947.

Going into the last ten min»

utes the home squad still had

a 66-55 advantage. The Pio»

neers swelled the lead to 86—

62 shortly before the end and

then slowed down slightly as

reserves were substituted into

the‘ game. ,

After the game Ffitsch ans

the big question

ad to do 7 and did it.” A mo.
ent ‘later he said simply, “We-
6 forgotten Carleton; now
e’re worrying about Coe."
