It’s Your Choice Now

Enrolling at Grinnell as a student, every individual
automatically accepts a two-fold responsibilityl

He is responsible to the college as a student; he has
an obligation‘to live under the rules of the school, and
specifically agrees to do so through a pledge signed by all
students at this fall’s registration,

As long as he receives the benefits of a nine»month
citizen of the town of Grinnell, he is also committed to
the town’s ordinances as well as those of the college.

Town—gown relations have been severely strained dur‘
ing the past years. In order to avoid serious trouble for
both the college administration and town authorities, a
student should remember that his actions and attitudes are
the criteria by which the college is judged by town people.

Violations of both of these standards resulted in the
recent series of suspensions. While these offenders were
punished very severely, they have served as examples to
others considering violations of existing rules.

Until the rules are changed, the excuse of “not know—
ing" can‘t be used again. The administration has made it
clear that future violaters will be punished accordingly,
since they have been shown their responsibility to these
laws and have made their decision.

Those Midsem Grades

There has been a lot of bush beating, with little in
the line of concrete knowledge coming out, on the Per-
sonnel board decision not to publish mid-semester grades
for old students, except for those grades below “C,"

By not publishing the grades, the college is'saving
quite a sizeable chunk of money and is freeing the regis-
trar's office from a task which used to keep it occupied
all through the yearl Assembling grades for over 800 stu-
dents four times a year is no easy task, and the registrar
can now spend more time on the important task of com-
municating with graduate schools

But aside from the material reasons for junking mid-
sem grades, a better argument can be made for the action,
The mid sem grades came too early to be accurate judge-
ments of student work

In this semester, for example, the “middle of the se»
mester," gradewise, is only six weeks after the start, ten
before the end. One third of the tests are given, and very,
little more of the class work has been assigned. There is
no real basis for a grade, which by the time it is published
will be obsolete.

The faculty approved it unofficially, and the student
body should follow suit.

Who Gets Socks Now?

The piles of dirty socks aren’t growing any smaller,
and before the stench from north campus drives men to
drink (thus, out of school) the interesting story of the non-
existent washing machine should be told.

The C of HP inherited a.year-old problem when it
decided to tackle the washing machine problem. The Stu-
dent Council had never been able to accomplish anything.
But the situation apparently changed when Bob Winter was
selected for the attack, and an agreement was made with
Wayne Cooley, who had just opened up a Maytag dealer-
shipl A special rate of payment was agreed on, and the
machine was to be at Grinnell when school convened this
fall. Of course, it wasn’t.

When things got hot, the C of HP looked to Cooley
to get help; but it seems even he can’t get Grinnell a wash-
ing machine. He says he has to get a special dealer’s license
from the home office of Maytag to sell a machine to a
college, This he says he has applied for, and has not re—
ceived.

Fred Maytag, 11, president of the company, will be in
Grinnell next week, and it‘s interesting to conjecture as to
'where he will toss the now—red-hot potato. Ike seems to
have all he can handle at the present time.

Meow

This week is National Cat Week, and it seems to us
that even if Grinnell has more canines than felines (as
scientifically defined) we should put in a plug for the little

beasts.

There have been a few dark

teeth and cutlery since the C of
HP ‘has extended evening dinner
l hdurs so as to afford a bit more
leisurely period of social inter-
course. Fines for violating the
dining room have increased to
startling proportions. Our en-nead
certainly has more intestinal
fortitude than I; after all, the
only thing Grinnellians all do
together any more is eat, and
l'm afraid I would become quite
nervous if I were to face that
mob with only a cuff and a
pencil. ,
