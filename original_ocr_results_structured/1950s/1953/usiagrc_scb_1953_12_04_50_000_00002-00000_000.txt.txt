When telephones ring in the dorms, the weather gets
nippier, and ARH’s rooms are inconvenient and uncomfort-
able, quiet studying space is hard to find. During a week
of exams and term papers conversations are best completed
on the library steps, with silence settling inside the closed
doors.

This consideration (made essential by the admittedly
overcrowded facilities of the college library) has not been
observed during the past few weeks. Let’s shit up!

The situation in which the Student Council Central
committee, the Student Organizations committee and the
faculty have found themselves in regard to the semester
fee distribution means more than that every student who
bought and paid for a Cyclone two months ago will have
to pay another dollar and a quarter.

It means, in addition, that it’s about time for each
student to look at the maze of governmental operations
on campus. Grinnell’s student government, now entangled
in triple-checked complications, has been involved in another
embarrassing (and expensive) fall): pas that has pointed
up the need for a change.

The twenty-four thousand dollars in the sem fee is‘
a large amount of money, However, one committee which
was immediately responsible to the students could efficient-
ly distribute that amount of money, and still be directly
checked by student opinion, ,

Change has never come about without informed and
vocal student interest, and n ve '11. Is there any‘7

Letters

To the Editor:

The League Board and the
Council of House Presidents
would like to clarify their posi-
tion in regard to the recently
proposed plan for unification of
the three extant constitutions
into one constitution,

Our representativés to the
constitution committee did not
formulate the plan. Their pur—
pose was to report to the Lear
guc Board and the c of HP the
plan as proposed by Roger
Perry nnd Norman Noc. in this
function they were able to
carry suggestions from these
two bodies to the constitution
committee. However, at the sec-
ond meeting of the committee,
it was decided that much time
could be saved by presenting
the plan as a whole to a joint
meeting of the League Board
and the c of HP. This was
done, and at this meeting the
plan was rejected by the Leer
gue Board and the c of HP for
the following reason.

The single legislative body
proposed by this plan seemed
impractical because it did not
adequately account for the dif—
ferent problems found on North
and South campuses. In other
words, under the proposed gov.
ernment, legislative power given
up by the c of HP and the LE
to the single legislative body
would have to be delegated out
again to they bodies in or-
der that their special problems
be taken care of most efficient.
ly. The result, therefore, was a,
mere changing of names with
out actual change in practice.

In conclusion, we should like
to make it very clear that we
are not apposed in principle

,to any change. But we cannot

give blanket acceptance or re—
jection to ”change" without
seeing a specific plan.

Sincerely.

League Board

Council of House Presidents

To the Editor;

After reading your editorial in
the last edition of the Scarlet
and Black. I decided to write a
brief letter, not only to state an
opinion but also to ask a quest
ion. 1 noticed, both from reading,
the Scarlet and Black and trom
hearing people talk, that a'plan
to change the organization of
student government is now be
ing seriously considered. I
thought this was a good plan
last spring, and I still think so,
but one stumbling block seems
to be in the way. if we do
unify the constitutions and set
up executive and judicial board's,
what Laws are thcse boards gar
ing to cntorcc zmd cdjudicatc7

, At the snx (professional
journalism) convention in SL
Louis recently. a committee
was tnlking about u ccso
whcrc n collcgc ncwspapcr
editor was tired.

it happened at Kansas UlnL
versity last year, and the editor
did violntc the lottcr of the
contract he had signed, by writ
ing an editorial in support of a
candidate (Adlai Stevenson) lor
the U. s. presidency.

It’s quite likely thnt if he
had comc out for Kansas’ own
Eisenhower nothing would ,
have happended, but that is '
not the point And the subject
is not exhausted when wo
admit thnt he had violatod an
ngrccmcnt.

A larger question is raised:
“Are state funds for universities
so sacred that the university has
to sacrifice its intellectual hon-
esty by limiting itself only to
‘nan . oontroversiel’, innocuous
discussion?"

The underlying argument must
actually have been this: “'I‘his
newspaper is state-supported;
therefore you can't otfcnd a
state taxpayer by printing some-
thing hc might not like." Cor-'
ricd to its logical extreme, the
ridiculousness of this reasoning
is obvious, And it’s flattering to
believe that college newspapersl
are so influential in an election‘
they mustn't be allowed to take
a stand for a candidate, but I'm
ofrcid we just ain‘t that infiur
ontiall ' ‘

No one nor any‘newspapm' .
exists in a vacuum. ‘

Even when am editor ignores
an election, he is tacitly sup.
porting the status qllo whether ,
he knows it or likes it or not. ‘
