John Pfltsch is a pessimist—at least he talks like one. Yester-
day he gave the eight reasons why his Grinncll hoopstcrs should
lose to Coe and Knox tonight and tomorrow. Here they are: 1. Bob
Winter has a Charley horse. 2. Bud Crowl has a bruised knee.
3, Dick Van Maur is suffering from a case at shin Splints. 4. DOC

Dibble is just getting over the ﬂu

Predictions have a strange way of making a laughingrstock:

cocky and boldly predict:

telling where the Pioneers may
stand in the conference mect.
Cornell is expected to retain its
title without any trouble. second
place is open to all the remain~
ing teams. The other squads are
almost equal in strength and
there will be a big scramble for
the second spot.

Scarlet and Black dropped a
close one to Carleton, 15.14.
The Pioneer matmcn won four

Unbeaten Knox;

Carls Hand Grinnell Firsl Defeat

g Grinnell's once beaten tankers will be out to regain the victory
trail against an undefeated Knox swimming team tomorrow after»
noon, 4 pm, in the Grinneli pool.

. Knox should be a real test for the Pioneers. as it has won all
six of its meets, beating Bradley, Missouri School of Mines, Ange

Anderson and Ted Fleming. Anv

dcrson is the defending conference champion in the 200 yd. back
and the ndividual medley, setting conference records in

. both events.

Anderson will be seriously
,challenged, as Grinnell is
strongest in the back stroke and
individual medley. Both Wally
Bragdon and Pete Vassilakos
have equalled Anderson's times.

Diver Ted Fleming looks to
be the class of the divers in
the conference, although his
undefeated record will be con-

tested by Grinnell's Bill Hejna
who has Won five and lost one.

Coach Lrv Simone locks for
a very close meet, with both
teams looking ”about the same
on paper." He feels that the
meet holds added interest be~
cause both Knox and Grinnell
are strongest in the same
cvents. Simone calls the meet
“a sounding board to see who
will take 2nd in the conference,

Simone is reserving the first
place spot for Carleton. the
team that the Pioneers lost to
last Saturday by a score of
55—38.

Carleton, led by Pete Eggers,
‘took seven out of the ten first
places. Grinnell’s firsts were ac-
counted for by Wally Bragdon,
in the 200 yd. back stroke and
individual medley, and Bill
Hejna in diving. Grinnell also
placed second in the diving in
the person of Sam Petroff.

Another standout for Grin-
nell was Howard Runyen, who
took second to Eggers in the
60 yd. free style and 100 yd.
free style.

Other planets for

were Pete Vassilakos,
Lawrence and Bob Ross.
