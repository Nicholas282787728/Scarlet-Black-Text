Mayfield Seeks individual Tille‘
As He Wreslles Final Season

by Rod Amie

One of the grapplers Whom
coach Bob Peterson is depend-
ing on for a successful year
this winter is his Veteran 167
poundcr, Gene Mayfield.

Maytield, 3 Gates senior
[mm Chicago, has placed sec-
and in the Midwest conference
meet for the last two years
and has a good chance of
climbing to the top this yearl

Gene wrestled three years in
high school and has won two
varsity letters at Grinnell. His
most decisive victory here at
Grinnell was during last year
when he pinned Wessell Bengs-
ton of Augustans in 30 seconds.
There is a possibility that May»
field and Bengston will clash
again when Grinnell opens its

season tomorrow against Augus-
tana at Rock Island, 111.

Conch Petexson declines,
”Gene loves to Wrestle and
wants to Win in order to
make the most of his 'last
yearn"

It is Mayfield’s opinion that
Grinnell and Coe will fight it
out for second place in the
conference with Cornell, the
overwhelming favorite, finishing
first.

Gene also added, “I like
wrestling because it probably
can build up une's confidence
more than any other sport."

Besides wresiiing he is an
APO member, works at KGRW,
and is on the coveted Dean’s
List. Gene is a psychology mar

Fuller's Views on Sludgllﬁovernmenl

“If students are willing to
take responsibility, 1 see no
reason why they should not be
allowed to have complete Charge
at their own affairs,” Dean of
the College Max Fulien said in
an interview last Monday.

“On the basis of my talks with
student leaders at Mills college,
Stanford university. and the
Amiated‘ Colleges of Clare-
mont, I .am of the opinion that
responsible student leaders who
have the backing of a unified
and responsible student body are
thoroughly capable of receiving
delegated power and authority
from the college to operate and
control all phases of non-aca-
demic student life."

Fuller went on to say that
this kind of government cannot
be forced on the students, and
that, on the campuses he visited,
this form was the product df
years of growth.

”There were certain factors
present on these campuses which
possibly may not be present at
Grinnell at the moment,

“For example, there was a
very strong feeling of respon-
slbility among all the students

Lyn Landes Chosen

As Pomona Queen

Marilyn Lnndes, who attended
Grinnell college from 1950 to
1953, was elected Homecoming
queen by the PomonavClaremont
football team this year.

A senio‘r this year, Lyn was
nominated by her class, and
reigned over the Pomonabcch
dental football game November
21.

for all aspects of student life.
This attitude made it relative»
ly easy for the student officers
to enforce social ,rules and re-
gulations.”

He explained that most of the
officers and student committees
were appointed by the cxecu»
tive council of the momated
students and were responsible
directly to them nether than
to residents of a particular hall
or dormitory.

Each of these campuses had
an active Sponsors organization
which was responsible for the
thorough orientation and indoc-
trixlation of all new students
during their first year on the
campus, Fuller added.

"These three factors, and
perhaps some others, made it
possible for the ssuoent leaders
to assume effectively much
more authority them 1 have ob.
served in the student governing
groups since 1 have been at
Grinnell.

“I L10 not wish to imply
that Grinnell college students
are unable to assume greater
responsibility. I simply mean
that, at present, our student
council is not comparable to
the organizaiovn of associated
students which i observed on
the other campuses.

“I do not believe that the pre»
sent organization of student
government at Grinnell could
function in the same manner as
those which 1 observed because
the climate of opinion on our
campus seems to be slightly
different at the moment. When a
majority of the students really
want a change, thcnwe canhave
-it,” he concluded.
