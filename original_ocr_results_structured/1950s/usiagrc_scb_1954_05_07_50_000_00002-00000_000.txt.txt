SCARLET AND BLACK

May 7. I954

 

Reconsider, Please

President Stevens told the 8&3 Wednesday that
“secular program such as is offered by the Men’s Glee
club is more appropriately held elsewhere than in the
chape."

He apparently concurred with the protest lodged after
the home concert of the glee club by Dean of the Chapel
Winston L. King. In a letter to President Stevens, copies
of which were sent to the music department and Duane
Crossley, Dean King protested the singing of such songs as
“There Is Nothing Like a Dame” in the chapel. He indi-
cated that sung elsewhere the songs would not have been
objectionable.

Two facts apparently were not considered very serious
ly. First, the curtains which were placed in the chapel
several years ago were there for the specific purpose of
convening a place of worship into a secular auditorium.
The curtains were drawn when the Glee club sang April
11. If the curtains are now meaningless they should be
taken down, for the organs tone is absorbed by the cur»
tains. Second, there is no comparable auditorium available
at the present time for the club to present its concert.

The only auditorium with acoustics approaching those of‘

the chapel is the high school auditorium, which is larger
than is needed for the club, and costs money to rent, an
important consideration in a departmental budget.

But what is more alarming is the statement that the»

songs were not objectionable, except that they were sling

in the chapel. This comes close to what we imagine Dean ..
King would call ”Sunday Christianity." If the songs were

objectionable in the chapel, the songs would be objection-
able if sung at the Three Elms.

The chapel ought properly to be reserved for religious
observanees: But until the college has enough money to

build a new fine arts building, including a fine auditorium, '

the college must adapt to what resources ar available,

It will mean inconvenience, and toes are going to be,

stepped on, but the chapel is still the best place for the
Glee clubs to present their home concert, and' it should
continue to be available.

Ehl'erlaining Opera Showings
Forecast for Tbmorrow NighiL

by Dan Nicolsou

 

It is Opera ngm in ARH Saturday, May 8, at 8:30. “The Maid.

as Mistress" and “The Telephone" will be presented. Though
Grinnell doesn’t have an Opera Workshop in word, it certainly
has one in deed. We can be proud of these productions.

A word to the wise. Don't sit too nesr the accompanists.
The acoustics are such that you’ll miss almost cverythin

The music of “The Telephone"l
is a bit dissonant but morc re-
freshingly than distractingly so.
The music oi “The Meid as Mis-

dlviduals in open: that not
only has a good voice, but has
a real grand manner of acting

tress" is Mozartian and most
pleasant.

"The Telephone” is a short[
curtain-raiser for the old. old
opera, “The Maid as Mistress."
It dates back to the early 1700's
and might be considered a
'musical comedy of that time.

What about the productions? .
Both are well done and each l
with a competent east. Judith
Roget and Charles Haynes,

student directors of "The Maid
A Is Misha" and “The Tale-

phone,” respectively, have
done good jobs of kmg
the actors and organizmg stage
movements.
, There are only two in the,
"cast of “The Telephone,” Marcia
Madden as Lucy and Roger
Perry as Ben. Bath parts were
made for them! They both havel
:good dramatic ability and exp;
cellent enunciation. Ben is;
driven to distraction by con—‘
stant telephoning, of the inanest
sort, interrupting his proposing
0 Lucy. '

There are three in the cast of
.“The Maid as Mistress," Barbara
Hansen as Zerlina. Woody Hurst
as Dr. Pandolpho, and Roger
Perry as Scapin. There is no
question but that Mr. -Hurst
steals the show.

He is one of the rare in-

 

. something

that perfectly fits his role.

Barbara Hansen, a sophomore,
has an outstanding voice with
real promise. it has quality and
freshness. Roger gets a nod for
his portrayal of Scapin, a mute
servant and a Bulgarian fire
enter.

The string ensemble in nTheI

 

Maid as Mistress," alone, is
worth seeing and hearing. It is
a fine group and they could welli
do a concert on their own.l
Shirley Speelman, the accompan»
ist for “The Telephone." is well
worth your notice, too.

All in all, Opel-a Night is
that shouldn't be

missed.

l
‘by Ed Lung

in regard to a letter appear-
ing elsewhere in the s at B,

that or cized the secret Men’s
Honor-G initiations:

1». If anyone
bout my purposes and tactics,
please re-read my column of
February 5, I have nothing to
add.

2. I will, stand on the facts
asserted as such in my col-
umns, whether they are about
the buildings and grounds
dept, or Honor->0: or Whatever.
Until now no one has pub-
licly challenged those facts—-
basicallyi I’ think, because
they are unchallengzblc be-
cause they are true.

the letter have been so certain
that the Honor-G initiation
would be criticized’LIs it per-
haps because they were certain
that it deserved criticism?

of the letter take a course in
remedial English and then re—
read last week’s column. They
will discover that my serious
criticisms of initiation activities
were directed at HononGls re-
cent secret initiations.

1 stated then and re-affil‘m
now that the public initiation‘
was “quite harmless and amus-
ing.” Also, an average twelve»
yeanold can understand that I
did not call the initiation preten-
tiouswheaven forbid. i wish to
make the obvious syntax per.
fectly clear.

5. I do believe that initia-
tions present their organizer-
Hons — not always in a favor-
able light, I hate to say —
and can serve as a mans of
weeding out the {unit-beamed
as well as instilling the be-
liefs oi the club in new mem-
bers. Fine.

5. My point was that when
an initiation is not merely de-
manding but is degrading and
indecent, it may take someone
with guts and self-respect to re-

fuse to be a party to i_t. An‘

earlier letter received by the
s & B—signed by one of the,
same men — admitted that the
initiation was “a bit indecent."
Thanks for an understatement.

7. 1 am quite willing to appear
before the president of the col-
lege_ with witnesses to verify

iTo the editor:

With respect to your editor-
,ial “All About Arena,” 1 would
‘tirst like to thank you for the
compliment concerning our ad-
vertising. However, there are a
few facts concerning the buiness
end of the magazine which were
in errorgl would like to clear
them up ior the benefit of our
subscribers.

letter will appear also. The
signers carefully avoided ex-
plainlng why the initiation was
not indecent. In all probability
they wil not accept this chair
lenge. This is my answento
charges of “hearsay" and being
“'narrow and isolated."

3. Many of the club’s mem-
bers agree with the basic
charges in my column last
week. They have told me so.
It would not be fair or ac-
curate to accuse them; only
a few members Were directly
responsible.

9. One of the signers of the
letter told me he joined Hone
or-G reluctantly because of the
secret initiation and that .he
finally chose to go through With
it, believing that his influence
from within the group could do
a better job of changing the
objectionable features. ,

10. Are “social complexes"
the only dangers? No. To say
that they didn’t realize the in-
decency and humiliation is a
frightening admittal and per-
halls a terrible indictment of
our generation and our times

The Ecli’ror

To the editor:

Four long and suffering years
lsgo, when l was a silly sopho-
more, there was graduated from
this institution a popular bellow
whose chief contributions to old
G c included the first student
musical and the notoriety of
spending a night in Loose Hall
(for those of you aspiring to
follow in his illustrious foot-
steps, note that he was sus-
pended for two or so weeks).
i Needless to say, he was rpopuc
’lar with the students and, to a
'certain extent, with the hallow-
ed administration. Came Honors
Convocation and this fellow was
presented with The Order ofthe
:Scarlet and Black, received from
the sacred hand of Dr. Stevens
himself, Tor, and my memory
may be a little hazy, but 1
think the citation read some-
lthing like this, for “service
lrendered above and beyond the
call of duty."
1 Since that fateful day of the
inception of the said Order, it
,has not been given. Which
‘)brings us to the purpose of vlhis
missive. Wha’ hoppen- is it
being gicen again? Was it meant
,tc be a single affair or a semi-
lreguiar thing? And‘, just what
are the requirements for the
polar?

Humbly submitted ,w the
Scarlet and Black this fif/th dry

‘of May, 1954.
