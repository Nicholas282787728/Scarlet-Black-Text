Extra Points .

by Larry Schaleger

The Midwest confelel-lce hoop race seems to have resolved it-
self into a two team battle between Cornell, victors over Grinnell
Wednesday, and Carleton, last year's co—champs, Cornell, although
now on top of the contab with six straight wms compared with the
Carls’ record of five and two, will be hard pressed by the Maize
and Blue as the season moves into its second hall.

The earls, a full one and oneelialt games behind the ltaiiis,
have a schedule break in that they play Cornell in their small
Northiield gym, where they are practically unbeatable, in tho
iinal game at the season, Cornell, dcspite the fact that they play
tour at six remaining tilts at home, will he weakened by the loss
of Watson nartbeck, al conicrencc second team choice last year
and eighth in loop scoring this season and may go into that
iinalc with Carleton with the trophy resting on the outcome,

The Pionecrs' goal tor the rest ot the season will be to finish
in the tirst division. Currently sharing the cellar ivith the Ripon
Redmen with one victory in six, the outlook for the remainder or
the season is brighter since the squad has tour of their last six
games at home.

i hope these guesses will be better than the ones I’ll be
making next week hot this is what the clear sphere says: Knox
wiii tall by 12 points; the Auguslana Augies will be easy prey.
