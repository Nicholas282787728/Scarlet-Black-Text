An Impelling Faith

No matter wllat students may have thought of the
Gates lectures, they must admit that Dr, Bridges was an
example of a rare thing: a man with a dynamic Christian
faith.

Those who expected challenging addresses were dis-
appointed, for what he said was neither new nor difficult.
Each talk seemed to be a collection of humorous illustra—
tions to put across a single point, an aimless circling rather
than a logical structure, '

While we enjoyed the entertainment, We missed the
intellectual stimulation we have come to expect from Gates
lecturers. But these things we did find in the speaker:
sincerity, honest humor, and refreshing realism which
admits not only the worst in man, but also the best—
something often overlooked by “l‘ealists” of college age.

To the Colors

Patriotism is defined as "love of olle’s country.”
Usually, it is not noticed unless it is found lacking. But
Grinnell students have Very quietly shown the respect and
love they hold for their country.

There have been no noon announcements calling at—
tention to the ceremony. There have been no appeals for
‘oooperation, but each afternoon at 4:30 p.m:, when the
AFRO’I‘C lowers the flag, students near the central campus
ﬂagpole forget their jokes and conversations to stand re—
spectfully still as the bugle)“ calls retreat.

It isn’t much, but that Iitttle action speaks well for

the future of America.

To the editor:

Ah, fame! Now the “Great-
est Newspaper in the World”
has deigned to recognize Grlne
nell college as a member of
what might be referred to as
the “horsey set." And as such,
we are classed by the Chicago
journalists (in a thoroughly hyr
pothetical manner?) with such
other institutions of equine at-
tainment as Kentucky and Hal"
vard.

But seriously, I wonder if the
staff of the S&B, when deciding
to reprint the nauseating none
sense from the “Trib,” concerne
col itself at all with the possible
differences between deserved
recognition of our college in
great newspapers, and mention
of our college solely for the
purpose of indulging in some
loul‘nallstic gymnastics on not
too high a plane.

I am really disappointed that
the 5&B saw fit to lower itself
into reprinting something as un-
savory as that which it dredged
from the “Trlb.” ’

Sincerely,
Merle Fischlowitz

To the editor:

“Every year lecturers and
concert artists of national and
international reputation are
brought to Grinnell for public
programs enjoyed by the col-
lege and by Visitors from sure
rounding communities." Tlus is
a quote from the Grinnell col-
lege Bulletin. catalog number
1945.50. The 1951 version re-
pests the statements, but Just
how true is it?

Considering only the first
part, what sort of national or
international reputation is en»
joyed by the artists on theiBSZr
53 concert series? We have had
two concerts, which should be
classified rather as recitals, by
persons or groups relatively uns
heard of by most of the college
communitv. The last two years
have seen the Same situation.
Cnc concert. which was given
by an artist having some not-
ionzll reputation, was enjoyed
by most Students but panned
by the music faculty. '

The second part of the state
ment related to the enjoyment
of the series looks fine» in
print. but have you noticed the
obvious attendance by the mus
sic faculty and their families
and the lack of interest on the
part of the students? The most
notable example of this was
”our" first concert this year
which served the noble purpose
of ”musical homecoming” for
the faculty.

To what does this lead? The
statement was made by a per-
son who helps in determining
the series that this is, what the
students want, and the faculty,
is merely trying to comply with
their wishes. For some reason,
this is not the impression l have
received from these same stu—
dents. ' ,

We all pay $1,400 per year
and expect to profit culturally
as well as scholastically as a
part of our social experience,
We are some 300 strong. lt’sl
about time some sort of reliable‘
opinion was secured from the
students. it’s a fine thing to
provide a proving ground for
rising young artists. but why
carry ii to extremes7

Colleges such as Ripon and
Cornell have artists who live
up to the qualifications set
forth in the Grinnell catalog.
Maybe it means a cut in the
number of concerts. Is this cat:
astrophic'! Student opinion
might be obtained through the

Rub
- Don't
— Blot

by Bruce Cole

I remember when I first
Came to Grinnell in the fall
there were thousands of birds
all Over the place. They used
to roost in the trees outside of
Bray house and Pine Tree. if
a young man from Bray house
had a date with a young maid
from Pine Tree he generally
had to wear a raincoat and
galoshes if he expected to look
presentable beyond the first
five minutes, i wonder what
happened to all of those birds.

Some folks say that there
isn’t enough for them to drink
around Grinnell because the
place 15 so dry. There’s prob
ably somethin to that; the pa-
pers_say if hasn't rained for
nearly 75 days. You have to be
awfully careful saying some-
thing like this in this joui-nae
lism business As 1 S|t at my
typewriter it's Thursday night.
But when you read this it will
be Friday night and it might
b‘e pouring buckets. In fact,
that would be lust my luck.’

Once I wrote a column all
about hell week. The main day
of hazing was on a Friday and
I had to write the Column the
night before. I lust figured it
would be crummy SC I Said 50.

Only i Said that it was crummy
just as if H! seen lt and l
said some other things, 100.
Friday. 1 walked past the lie
brary steps just for fun and
thc hazing was going on and
everyone was getting a big bang
out of it. l almost enjoyed it a
little myself. 1 had to tear
down to the Herald-Register
where this thing is printed and
rewrite the whole column. The
linotype operator was upset, to
s the least, and l got my
hands all full of printers' ink
because they made me reset it
myself,

I heard about some meteor-
ologists once who went down to
someplace in Peru or Chile
where it hadn't rained in 27
years. Those guys wanted to
measure the humidity and all
that stuff. although I can’t see
that tllere’d be particularly
much to measure in a spot
where it hadn’t rained in 27
years. But they were college
men and had to see for them-
selves.

The plncc was out in the
middle of a desert and it was
really dry, It was so dry they
had to spit with their mouths
shut and that’s not easy. Even
then they never got to see it
land, Well, these guys got all
their meteorological (i think
that’s the longest word ever to
appear in the 5&8) equipment
set up and sat around with pen-
cils poised. What do you think
happened?

it mined. It rained so hard
that it washed away all the
equipment and a few of the
meteorologists, it washed away
their trucks and ieeps and
those who survived had to
walk all the way home just
like the little piggy who went
to market. i’ll bet those guys
were sorry they waited so long.

rm going to a sigma Delta
Chi convention in Denver next -
week and I’ve heard that that‘s
not a very dry town at all. If

one's fault but my own. Jim
