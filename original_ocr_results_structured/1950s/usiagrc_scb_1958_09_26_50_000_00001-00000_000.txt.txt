shortly atter World War ll,
while students at an Indianapo—
lis conservatory.

After leaving the school and
beginning to make their way in
professional circles, the three
were joined by Ken Errair. in
these lean years, the Freshmen
resisted urgings that they change
the unusual style which has now
become their trademark.

Among the leading exponents
of “modern sound", the Fresh»
men combine four-part harmony
in fresh and distinctive arrange-
ments, always interestingAIare-
1y predictable.

In addition to their singing
chores, the four often provide
their own accompaniment, with
Don and Ross Barbour on gui-
tar and drums and Flenigan
and Errair sharing bass work

The facultysstudent Homecom-
ing and Commencement commit—

suggested that students extend
personal invitations to their par
ents at once.

for arranging for both housing
and meals for his own family,"
Prescott said. “This should be
done -as soon as possible, since

er than usual this year and the
time grows short."

Arrangements for meal tickets
are to be made directly with
the food service.

”Since local public housing is
severely limited, and most of it
is already full,” said Prescott,
“arrangements have been made
to assist students in ﬁnding
housing in local private homes
for their guests.

“Next week, Monday through
Friday, housing otiice hours will

Set For Weekend

The 1957-58 Cyclone year»
book, smaller in surface area
but considerably thicker than
the previous book, will be dis.
tributed Sunday if the books
have arrived by then.

According to business man—
agerl Joe Nassif, the books were
shipped from Taylor Publishr
ing Co. in Dallas, Tex., on
Tuesday. They are expected to
arrive either today or tomor-
row. Distribution will be from
the Cyclone oﬁice.

Nassit stated that a delay in
mailing four index pages to the
publishers is the reason the
book is coming out later than
originally announced. .

“This Cyclone," stated editor
Mary Lou Brooks, ”has a central
theme rather than seasonal di-
visions." Each hall was given
four pages for parties and ac-
tivity pictures. An editor was
selected for each section. They
were Rob Madgett, sports; Judy
Morgan, halls; Betsy_ Hertz, or-
ganizations and activities: Ellen
Blaser, junior-senior section;
Mickey Miller, art and general
layouts, and Joe Nassit, adver-
tising section.

The new issue ieaturcs both
endshects in full color. tutor-
mal pictures oi the taculty

queen and her two attend.
ants. “In the future," Mary
Lou said, “we hope that the
selection oi the Cyclone queen
will he made by school—wide
vote, with n dance and presen»
tntion oi the queen becoming
a regular feature of the social
calendar.”

There will he several extra
copies of the yearbook available
to upperclassmen at a date to
be announced. The price will be

$6 a copy.
