irecommends that the individual
halls be allowed to ‘build their
homecoming decorations at their
own discretion.”

The c of HP held a special
meeting Tuesday with football
coach Hank Brown in attend~
ance. Brown said the athletic
department had not asked for
any curfew and he personally
thought such an edict would
only produce more noise.

He had thought of taking the
team euteofetown to a hotel on
the night before homecoming to
impress the younger players
with the importance of winning
the game. His budget, however,
wouldn’t cover such an expendi-
ture.

Younker halls, the c of HP de-
cided to drop the case. In the
future, halls will be fined when

cept by hall. It will be the house
council’s responsibility to dis.
cover those who figure in the
incident.

WSSF Ciimaxes Drive with Auction

Books donated by students in the U. S. through WSSF arrive
at the Japan student relief committee’s ofﬁce.

Action gets underway Monday
in the start of the World Stu-
dent Service Fund drive on the
Grinnell campus.

Top feature listed for the
campaign this year is the tradi-
ttional auction dance to be held
on the closing day, Nov. 10,
when students are able to bid
ifcr the services of various merry
bars of the faculty and admin-
istration.

In an introductory meeting
last night for those working on
WSSF this year, Miss Nyla
lStuntz from the national organ-
ization explained the services
which are received from the
money that goes into the fund.
‘Using her own experiences in
her contacts with students of
other countries, Miss Stuntz ex-
nressed the inadequate condie
,tions of studying in these areas.
l Money is needed for medical
suonlies, libraries, backs, upr
keep on buildings, and for all
”m, incidental expenses that
iarise. In most countries, a
loreat nerccntaee of the students
are without any means of sup-
nnrt other than the labs that
“WV can combine with their
col‘eee Work

Miss Stuntz stated that college
students in Gcrmanv. in spite of
their own needs. have suggest»
ed that the monev this year be
used to Combat the more unfor-
itunate educational conditions in

 

other parts of the world. if the
students in this country can
show even a part of this atti-
tude, she said, they can do much
to further the ”cementing of in—
ternational relations."

An amazing amount can be
accomplished by the money
given to WSSF by American
Istudents. Two dollars is enough
to provide the food required for
one week by a refugee student
in Italy. Seven dollars will pro-
vide hot breakfasts through the
three coldest winter months for
one Austrian student suffering
from malnutrition.

But the number of things to,
be done, the providing of some
sort of housing, clothing, and
feeding, require real giving up,
rather than giving, by Ameri—
cans.

On 'H'te Air

Elbert Morse Smith will
play a varied program of
organ music on the Grinnell
college radio program Mon-
day at 4:45 p. m. on w01
(640 on the dial).

A mystery play, “Once
More I’ll Die," will be fea~
tured on wsUl (920 on the
dial) Friday, Oct 26, at
4 pm.
