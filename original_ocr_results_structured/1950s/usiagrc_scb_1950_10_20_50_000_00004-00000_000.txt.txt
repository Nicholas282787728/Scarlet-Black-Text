Co-Eds Give a Lift to_ Patients

Thirty-two upperclass women poured out. 01 a Grinnell bus on,

to Lhe grounds (if the Veterans’ Administration mental hospital at

Knoxville Tuesday night.
The girls visited the hospital

to attend a dance given for a,

selected group of the patients.
These world war 1 and 11 vote
erans have dances each Tues
day night as a part of their
complete social program which
also includes movies, music, .and
smokers.
Stag Line Rivalry

An unusual aspect of the
dance was the mental comparr
son college students continually
made to Grinnell dances. As
rules restrict patients from danc-
ing; twice successively with one
girlL stag line competition is

keen. The men line up before,

each dance, spot their next part-
ners, and. zit the opening bars of
the first piece in a set, make a
beeeline for the partner of their
choice, Some patients get a
jump on their friends by get—
ting promises for dances ahead
of time.

The Grinnell hostesses. as well
as others attending a hospital
dance for the first time, assem-
bled with the recreation direc-
tor before the dance and learn-

. ed the details about the way the
dances are conducted at the hos-
pital. Rules prohibit dancing
with one person more than
three times, writing to patients,
or mailing their letters. "We are
not trying to operate a‘mati'i-
i'nonial hureau,‘Y he said.

; "We want girls to wear
high heels or dressy shoes and
dress up for these parties,"

the director explained. “You

have no idea how much the
morale of the boys is raised
by. making it a dressy affair,

They like to my on their suits

too."

A-hand. made up of patients,
attendants, and professional mun
sici'ans, plays for the dances
each week. The professional
band members prefer their two-
hour weekly engagements at the
hospital to the longer, more
lucrative jobs they could take.
They say that the appreciation
shown by the crowd as well as
its good behavior makes them
want to play there each week.
The dances are held in the rec-
reation building. The large
room, floored with rubber tile,
is used for stage plays and also
has ia projection booth for mos
vies,

Service illness

Some veterans at the hospital
have mental illness as a result
of service in the armed forces
and others have illnesses which
have become apparent in civv
ilian life. Some of the patients
understand their own difficul»
ties to some extent as well as
those of other patients.

others who are not now Consid—

. students,

There '

i
lered curable, but they are kept.
at the hospital for the excellent
care they receive therc.

Despite good facilities and
sympathetic treatment, there
are patients who believe they
are being tortured or who are
firmly convinced there is no
need for them to be kept in
the hospital.

However. the recreation leade
er said, “We can’t afford to keep.
anyone here who doesn‘t belong’
,here. if you saw most of the
men you’ll be dancing with to!
night walking down the strcetﬂ‘
you wouldn‘t notice any abno ‘
.mality in their behavior. Thcre
Lare some who would seem nor-.

ml in their behavior. There are
some who would seem normal
during a short conversation, but
if you talk to thc men at lengthl
you’ll notice abnormalities.”
College Alumni 1
Mrs. Lyman Case, the Red
Cross representative from Grin-
ncll who is responsible for tak
ing the college group to Knoxe
ville, said the men appreciate
college hostesses particularly.
Many of the men have attended
college and are looking forward
to returning after they leave
the hospital. Others were intere'
ested in Grinnell because they
follow the sport news, as well
as world news, closely.

Miss Lesta Lemmons (dean‘s
office) accompanied the stu—
dents with Mrs. Case.

Prexy Welcomes New SC Members

"A good leader Can Create it spirit of solidarity within the hall
and induce compliance with the rules,” said Dr. Samuel N. Stevens,

*He stated that the Council:
must be big enough to super-
vise all campus grganizationsi
and still be sufficiently elastic
to serve every need,'adapting to
changing Conditions while fol-
lowing established traditions. i

"The Council.” he said. “should

not allow ’itselt to become
sterile of original ideas through
its administrative activities inl
student government. Even radi-
cal changes, if for the benefiti

of the students, would be ac-,
Ccptable.” ‘
