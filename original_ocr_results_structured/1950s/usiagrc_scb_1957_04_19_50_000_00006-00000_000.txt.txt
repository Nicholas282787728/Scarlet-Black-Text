Organic poetry, currently

circles, is primarily character

say: "Dibble plumbing is bad,
The Dean of Men and the c of
HP should serve as_g sounding-

can get no help from the tactile

Problems. We are the lost gen-
eration, the careful young men,
and we have a rendezvous with
destiny." Thus his free spirit
transcends 'the mundane and
materialistic. You ﬁgure it out.
