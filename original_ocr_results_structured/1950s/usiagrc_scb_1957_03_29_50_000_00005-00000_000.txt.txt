the team with a ﬁrst in the 50 a

yard low hurdles by edging out

i

a time or :06.
The mile relay team of Tom
Castles, Det Abel, vihert Mah-
anger and John Wolden took
a fifth place behind Drakes
winning time of 3:305.

Conley consistently placed

  

first and second in the high and ’ ,

low hurdles last year and took

second in the low hurdles in the

Midwest conference meet held

here last spring.

The future of Sam Petr-off
is still uncertain. Petra",

year the cindermen took five
firsts in the affair, winning the
sprint medley, the low hurdle
shuttle relay, the two ile re~
lay, the javelin throw and the

Spring is here—officially, any“.
wayﬁand {or the golf team that
means Memphis, Tennessee.

Irv Simone, the gent who
was given a “vote oi no con-
ﬁdence" tor his desire to malic‘
our recreatlonal program suc-
cessiul, will be devoting his
second vacation this year to
traveling with one oi our ath—
letic teams.

He and eight members of the
swim team went to Fort Lau—
dcrdale, Fla, during the Christ-
mas recess for two N eks of
conditioning, training, and re-
laxation. It was a tremendous
success‘even it for nothing else
than the experience of coach
and team going as a unit to
represent Grinnell in a now
world-famous swimming forum.

Due to the conditioning at-
tained on the trip the tankmen
ﬁlnished their Midwest confer-

ence dualsmﬂet season without,
a defeat,

Tomorrow Mr. simonc will
pack his geer, and once again
head southethis time with
Jim Gabrielson, Jim Ander-
Son, Phil Nelson, Denny Col.
lis, and Dave Goss—the '57
goii team.

The group has a meet with
Memphis State college early in
the week and one with Drury

lM Softball Title;
Games Start Soon

Intramural Softball season
will officially get under way
on Thursday, April 11, The
games this year will again
be played on both Tenth Ave. .
and MacEaclll’on fields. All
games begin at 4:15 p.m.i
and n0 inning may begin
after 6:00 pmi due to the
dining room dress rule. The
season officially ends on May

‘ 13

There has been one change
in the rules, according to Jay
Botvinick, assistant Intra-
mIII'al chairman. The Official
Softball Rulelmo states that
on a wild throw, touching any
port ,or a flelder’s person, the
runner may advance as many
hases as possible. Because the»
diamonds lack fences the [li-
tramural committee decided
to make the following change.
"On a wild thrnw to any bise-
man who touches the ball, the
base runner may only advance
two bases." All other rules are
in accordance to the softball
rulebook.

Last year's league winner,
Gates, opens its season against
Langan on April 13. Out of their
starting ten of last year, seven
have reported for varsity base-
ball, The Intramural chairmen
report that similar occurrences
are taking place in all the halls.
However, even though the rec
establishment of baseball may
weaken the 1M play, it hasn’t
hurt enough to take away from
a good season.
