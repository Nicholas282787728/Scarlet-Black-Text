STUDENTS ARE ECSTATIC about Luckies. That’s the word,
straight from the latest, largest college survey ever. Again,
the No. 1 reason Luckies lead in colleges over all other
brands, coast to coast—border to border:
better. They taste better, ﬁrst of all, because Lucky Strike
means ﬁne tobacco. Then, that tobacco is wasted to taste
'better. This famous Lucky Strike process tones up Luckies’
light, good-tasting tobacco to make it taste even better.
So be smart, like the student in the Droodle above, titled:

self. Enjoy the better-tasting cigarette . i .
