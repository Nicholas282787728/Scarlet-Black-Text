the defending champions, also
cannot be counted out of the
running.

Records Endangered

On the basis of performances
this spring, loul- records appear
to be in peril. Three oi these
four records are held by tor-
mer Grinnell stars and also
three oi the tour are being
‘threatened by Grinnell men.
since the only official confer-
ence records are those made in
the conference meet, tour men
who ha’ve unotticially broken
marks will be out to dupulicate
their performances.

The discuss record of 144‘ 9"
set by Kapp’ ct Lawrence in
1938. will he in greatest danger
from Dick Walker ct Grinne1l
who has a Loss or 148’ 9“ to
his credit this spring.

Javelin Scramble

Three men will be. shooting
tor the javelin record of 192’
10" set by Barker of Grinnell
in 1940. Sam Petrott has a
200* 2" effort on the books this
spring. Ulysses Doss of moon
has made a 191’ 7” toss and Bob
Phelps of Grinnell has posted
a 187’ toss. '

George Drake will be shooting
at the halt-mile record of 1:—
56.7 set by Hugh Acton of Grin-
nell in 1950, Bill Baird of Cox'-
nell, winner of the shot put
tor‘ the past two years, has top-
pad the conference record or 47'
Wt", set by Terry Ellis oi Grin-
hell in 1953, with a 47' ll” ef-
tort.

Injuries Hurt Cornell

A run-down oi the Grinnell
squad shows that in addition to
the possible record-breakers list.
ed above, Coach Booth has
another standout contender tcr
an individual crown in Chuck
Westrup, whose :2i.2 time tor
the 220-yard low hurdles is the
best posted this spring.

Early in the spring, Cornell
appeared to be the team to heat,
but a series of‘injuries appear
to have reduced the Rams’
strength. A week ago Wednes—
day, in a triangular meet, Grin-
nell tallied 85% points to 701/:
for Cornell. Cae had 6 points.
