In case you or your readers
do not 'rs-cognize them: The

crawls out after dark to put in
an appearance at some at our
public aila ~s, say the women's
dance intramurals.

His mental age seems to be
somewhere between 8 and 12,
not more. Too bashlul to tell»;
to the girls directly, he still
wants to get their attention so
he brings along his best bean
