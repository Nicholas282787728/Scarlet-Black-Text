King Talks Sunday;
Expands God Topic

“Godrthe Companion" is
the theme for the sermon to
be given Sunday at 11:30
a.m. in Herrick chapel by
Winston L. King, dean of the
chapel. This iS the last in a
series of three sermons given by
King. His idea for the series
came from Alfred N, White-
head’s book “Religion in the
Making."

It states, “Religion is what
the individual does with his own
solitariness. It runs through
three stages, if it evolves to its
final satisfaction. It is the tran-
sition from God the void to
God the enemy, and from God
the enemy to God the compan—

ion."
