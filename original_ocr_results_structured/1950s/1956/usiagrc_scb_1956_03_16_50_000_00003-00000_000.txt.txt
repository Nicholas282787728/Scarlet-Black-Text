ing senior wasn't an outstanding
star or a record breaker, but
was a consistent po‘mtugetter on

pionship squads.

Although a ﬁne distance
swimmer in his own right,
Doug was never able to gain
the “No. 1” spot, because of
the pronﬁnmlcc of his team—
mates. These included such
stars as Barry Lawrence (19-
54), Chuck Hnwlrey (1955-56)
and Bill Simmons (1956).
Doug starved his Grinnell

swimming career as a member
of the 1953 freshman conference
champions. He was a member of
the winning 400-yard free style
relay team and took tomb in
the 220-yard‘ free style event,

relay team also competed credit-
ahly on the following night at

Fine performances by Scotty
Walker, Jack Shaffer, John Wel-
den and George Drake enabled
Grinnell to win the sprint med-
ley relay, Drake returning his
best-ever time for the halt-mile

Noel Bacchus, John Weldon and
George Drake gave the favored
Cornell team some shit competi-

qualifying for the Milwaukee
meet.

At Milwaukee the following
evening, the team turned in an
even better performance, and
though taking second place to
Cornell again, gave that team
some cause for apprehension as
to the outcome of future meets
this season.
