Political Awareness

The Scarlet and Black enters a different field of news
coverage with th' issue. On page 2, we have printed an-
alyses of two political speeches. We urge you to give these
your attention.

In all election year, it is impossible for aware college
students to ignore political campaigns. We do not intend
Io compete with daily newspapers in presenting campaign
coverage. However, we feel tllat there is definite value in
presenting views of college students in our newspaper.

Articles, written by'both students and faculty mem—
bers, will appear in succeeding issues. There will also be
information on absentee Voting for those students who
qualify. Our Washington correspondents, Lynn Parsons and
Tom Skornia. will send periodic columns from the nation‘s

capital.

I This will not interfere with our regular campus cover—

age. It is an added service w
and we hope that every qlltll

vote.

h we hope you will enjoy,
d student at Grinnell will.

Being an election year, activ—
ity in the-nation's capital this
iall will be oi special interest.
At this opportune moment,
Grinncll has iour students at—
tending American uiiivorsitys
Washington scmcstr-r plan, a
single semester, intensified study
at American national govern»
nicnt at its source. The plan.
oi which the Grinncll adviser
is Dr. Joseph Wall, consists oi

. sonic 78 small colleges around
the nation Two oi thc Grmnel-
lians, whose names appear
'above, thought that they would
like to share with the 5&2
some oi their‘ obsorvations of
Washington, both political and
geographical. This is their initial
column oi “Capital Comnlen»
tary.” *

Wc honestly hope that our
cronies at Grlnnell won‘t hold
it against us for llavmg the gall
to be Staring at them on occa-
sion irom thc hallowed pages
of the 3&3, We're only going
to be born tor a semester, any
way, so after that Alllcy can
wear to our iaccs.

As one (or even two) might
expect, yours truly hnve been
spending the majority oi their
time sightseeing and making
merry. 1n the iirst category
several things are to he lilo
beled “must" in addition to
the usual spoctaculars oi mon—
uments, nntinnill iircliives, and
other trivia.

This wcck's suggestion is Get-
tysburg, with its historic battle
iicld, illustrated in cxccllcnt
historiographical manner on an
ciccti-ic map, monument to the
Lincoln address at the locals,
and a rustic iarm to which tho
incumbent president will be rc-
tired in November. 0n the way
back one may ride by tho Sher-
atoanark hotel cvcry othcr
wcckcnd to iind a battle-scarred
campaigner with a hole in the
bottom or his shoe laboring
with pen and parchment.

politically, lowans have had
a better luck at tho presiden—
tial candidatcs than we have,
oi course, The area is coma
plelely devoid of Congress
men, and the resulting lack
oi hot air has reduced the
average temperature by three
degrees. There is some talk
about 73 iorthcoming special
session to coniirm Eisenhow—
as replacement oi the retir-
ing Justice Minton. it so, we
can expect n worm and humid
autumn.

By next week yours truly
Should have had the Opportunity
oi interviewing some oi the per-
sonncl at the two national com—
mittees, among various other
great pcoplc, and be able lol
convoy more in the way o{:
worthwhile ncws. During ol‘ienr
tallon weeks It's pretty hard [0‘
come to a conclusion about any~
thing, as this column indicatcs

The iollowing is a small. but!
i think vcry signiiicant news
item: With the use o1 a port-
able electric grill bchind thc
caictcria line, breakiast eggs in
Cowlcs dining room are being
iri d sunny ertlp and placed
directly on the plate.

Besides taking a great step on
the quest ior the edible cgg,
Mr. Gooselaw and the Cowlcs
staii have per-hops hit upon the
solution to bcttcr over-all food
service.

It has long been my convicA
tiongtllat a great many oi the i
“Grinnell specials” oi dubious 1
quality (even roast bcci and
ircnch-iricd cauliilowcr) could
be greatly improved ii they
came to us “llot oii the stove,"
instead oi being cooked in
great quantities and lct't to
dry out on the steam tables.

 

i

it is obviously lniposslblc to
cook food like corn, beans and
potatoes ’at the serving lineﬁ
they must be, to some extent.
kept warm because they are
cockcd in such bulk quantities.
But there is a great deal oi
room ior the reductlon oi the
period of time irom stove to
plate.

The Cowles staff is perhaps
most guilty oi preparing meals
in a rush, and having the kite
chen cleaned up by the time the
dining hall opens ior a meal.
Last year on two occasions that
1 know about ior sure, they be-
gan irying chicken at e on Sun-
day morning ior dlmler.al: 1:30.

(A piece oi chicken that is
reheated and served seven and
onc-lmli hours nitor it. is
cooked requires the consumpr
tion or at least one glass oi
water along with it, or at least
i iound this to bc the case).

I believe that the Cowles sit.
uation cannot be justified, be»
cause it seems that the Quad
cooks manage to do much bet-
ter, They are oitcn cooking iood
up to the last minute (some-
timos it is tinicd so well that
waiters got iood directly oii the
storc) and the result is a hettci»
tasting meal. I think popular
opinion \l'lll bear me out here.

In the last year, we have
seen the passing oi the watery
"sofirboiled" egg. and the
“(lamp cardboard" iricd egg.
Maybe the same principle that
remedied this unappetizing
situation can be applied to the
whule menu.

(Mr. Gooselaw suggests that
ii men who do not have an Bi
o’clock will cot breakfast a little
later, it will avoid a 7 o'clock
iush and will enable the new,
egg-serving system to function
with no congestion in the lined}

Right now the council is in a

Now I am told that the girls

any particular play. 1 hope
thisds not true, because the
iaot is that the post or Stu-

more important. 1t is more
important than running tire
