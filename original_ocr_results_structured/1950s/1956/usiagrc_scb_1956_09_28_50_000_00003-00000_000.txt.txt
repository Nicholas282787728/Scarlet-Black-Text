Reva Sadow said, “As in all
the arts dance is not an esoteric
pursuit. The experience is not
enjoyed by the dancer alone,
but must be shared by a crea-
tive audience; in other words,
therc must be an interdependent
relationship between the crea—
tive audience and the dancer to
make the cxpcricncc complete."

Fbs’rer On Leave
To Prepare Book

Charlcs H. Foster (English),
-who will be on leave during°
the first scmcstcr, will devote
most of his time'to research on
a new book he is planning Inl
collaboration with anothcr writ-l
CI‘. '

Eaily research on the book,
which will be an anthology call-
ed “The Abolitionists,” will bc
largely done in thc college lisl
brary, which has a considcrablcX
variety of books and documents]
on the subject l

“Not the least of these is
the wealth of matcrial availr

ablc on J. B..Grinnell," Fos- ,

ter said. “There can be no
question of the importance

our own ‘fountling father’ had

in the abolitionist movement,

both during his prod-owe ;
years back East and later
here as host to John Brown
and operator of a local station
oi the ‘underground railwayi’ " ’

His 1954 book, “The Runglessl
Ladder: Harriet Bccchcr Stowe
and New England Purilunism,”
was partly conccrncd with some
of the personalities who will be
included in thc plojccted hook

Foster has just Icturned from
three weeks stay in the East‘
whcrc he carried on some re
search on another- project at the

(Editor’s note:

Chuck Steglncil‘,

’t'iG, conducted a sur-

vey last April concerning the impact of the S&B on the
student body. He circulated questionnaires containing five

general questions:

portant and/0r powerful place on the Gl'innell campus"
“How frequently do you read the 5&3?” 3.
strongest adverse criticisms of the S&B?” (Suggested
“Do you think the S&B genera

criticisms were listed.) 4.
ally expresses proposals and
views that you agree with in its
editorials?" 5. A list oi‘rnaterials
usually available in tho 5&8
was given. Students were ask-
ed to check which items they
usually read, those itéms for
which the 5&3 represents. their
primary source. and which they
felt should be lelt out of the
paper

Sixty-three percent of the stu-
dent body answci-cd the queSr
tionnaircs. Following is Strg-
mcir's conclusion on his findings,
it is printed in answer to sew
oral student requests)

it . . i There is stiff ient
evidencc to say that . the
Scarlet and Black has a def-
inite, strong impact within the
Grinnell student body. The
three chief reasons for this
conclusion are the results or
questions one, two and four.
These showed that 32% of the
students who replied feel the
8&3 has an important and/or
powerful place on the Grin-
nell campus, that 65% of these
students always read the 5&8
and 29% read it most of the
time, and that 86% of these
students gencrally agree with
the proposals and views that
the 5&3 expresses in its edi—
torials.

“As far as question threc is
concerned, the relatively small
percentages of replying stude s
who chcckcd four specific cri —
cisms, ‘It doesn’t represcnt the
studentsill‘k, ‘It doesnt do a
good 1017 of covcring news —12%,
‘It neyer crusades—15%, and
‘It won't defend student views

“What are

lion cirtrci n'ilﬁ%, would in-
dicate the S&B has an impact
in these vrtal arcas. Also the
fact that,lo%_ of the students
who replied had no adverse

criticism at all means a good
deal.

“However, on the other hand,
not too much can be drawn from
this question (thrce) since it is
not statcd in a way to accurate—
ly measure the amount of im-
pact that the 3&3 has in the
areas involved . . .

“Question five also justilies
the author's conclusion in that
it illustrates the role or the
5&3 as a primary source for
student information and shows
that much of he paper is read
by inost of the students who
responded.

“Columns are read by 72%.
editorials by 70%, explanations
of changes and modifications in
college rules, policies, facilities,
etc. by 76%, letters to the cells
tor by 72%, news about other
students by 70%, news of grants,
gifts. awards, recognition rc-
ccivcd by the college by oa%,l
news of faculty members by
60%, and news of scheduled
campus events by 73%. The soils
was the primary source of 9X7
planatlons of changes, with 42%
of the students who replied; for
grants, gifts, with 57%; and for
news of faculty members with
50%.

“or chief interest as far as
the criticisms in question three
are concerned is that 37% of
those who responded checked
that ‘There is little or no va-

Arts, Crafts Fill

Richard Ccrvcirc (art), spent

pating in the choreography of
the camp's summer musical
comedy.

New in the type of stories

printed;

“All in all, after checking
all 509 questionnaires, the
author gained the impression
that the Grinnell student body
is not nearly its dissatisﬁed
with the Scarlet K5 Black as
would Seem to he the case
from surface impressions. Fur»
thermorc, he is convinced that
the paper is a most importantV
powerful and influential force
on the camvus.

“The author also tools the
questionnaires indicated that the
Sim could be much more im-
pcrtant, poucrful and influential
if it would speak out more often,
morc strongly and more authori
tatively. "
