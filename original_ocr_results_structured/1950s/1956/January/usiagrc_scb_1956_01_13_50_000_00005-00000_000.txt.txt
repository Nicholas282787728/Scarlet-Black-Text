Swimming Great
Joel Stubbs

Finishes Career
by Wills Davidson ‘

Joel Stubbs, senior from
Peoria, Ill, has just launched
another swimming season at

Grinnell—and from all indiCa-
tions, he may be changing the
record books once again.

Jo’el, who is president of
Langan Hall, has been a men-i»
her of Honor “G” for three
years, and has won two varsity
letters in swimming.

. Record-Smasher

Stubbs‘s record-smashing be-
gan in his sophomore year when
he helped set pool and varsity
records in the 300-yd. medley
relay race (with Tom Hejna,
and 1955 graduate Wally Brag-
don), and the «mayo. freestyle
relay (assisted by lBragdon,
Chuck Hawtrey, and another
graduate of last year, Howie
Runyon.) To top this off, he
won both the 50<yd. and lDDvyd.
free style races in the Confer-
ence meet.

Joel continued to smash rec-
ords in his junior year, setting
new pool and varsity standards
in both the 60-yd. and 100<yd.
free style events. His time for
[the so also tied the conference

, mark. Once again Stubbs won
the conference 50-yd. and 100-
yd, free style races: These Vic»
turies climaxed an unbeaten
season for Joel.

Predicts Good Season

This year‘stubbs is acting as
co»captain along with John
Marsh, and feels that “we aren’t
’as good as last year, but 1
think it’s going to be a good
season, and we’ll finish up near
the top.”

Joel is a psychology major.
and is planning on three years
of graduate school and a career
as an industrial psychologist,
after he finishes at Grinnell.

Pioneer Comeback
Drive Falls Shor'l'
In Loss To Cornell

The Pioneer cagers lost to
Cornell’s powerful defending
champs 75453 last Tuesday
night in Darby, after a spirited
second half comeback failed to
overcome the Ram’s
46<28 halftime margin.

Despite Grinnell’s second half
effort, the Rams were in com-
plete control throughout the
game, largely due to the efforts
of Merle Gaber who tallied 21
points in the first half and
wound up as the game's leading
scorer with 28. Dick Crowl led
the Pioneers’ with 23.

rioneers Sink To Fifth

Preseason pollsters had tab-
bed the Grinnell-Cornell contest
as a key game in the confer-
ence title fight, but the game
lost much of its luster after
Cornell lost to lowly Knox and
Griunell dropped two games
last weekend.

By Virtue of the win, Cornell
moved into second place in the
loop with a 4-1 record, behind
surprising Knox who edged the
Rams 82—80 in its only confer
ence game to date. Grinnell fell
into a fifth place tie with Coe
with an even split in six
games.

Rams Control Boards

The Pioneers weren’t able to
find the hoop, and with Cor»
nell’s Don Carlson and company
controlling both backboards,
were completely helpless until
seven minutes had elapsed in
the second half.

At this point, the lineup
which coach John Pfitsch had
inserted near ﬁle middle of the
first half of John Musser, Dick

2 Loop Foes

In its first competition since
the vacation layoff, the pioneer
wrestlers traveled to Northfield,
Minn, today, to Lake on St.
Olaf tonight and Carleton t0-
morrow.

Coach Bob Peterson says that
the Pioneers will have a good
chance in both meets, but warns
that St. Olaf is very strong this
year, and that Carleton also has
a good team.

Both the Oles and Carls fell
victims to Grinnell by comfort—
able margins in dual meets last
year, although in the conference
meet, st. Olaf emerged in third
place as compared to Grinnell’s
tie for fourth. The Pioneers
topped st. Olaf 19.9 and downs
ed the Carls 26-8.

The Pioneer team, in addition
to captain Tim Walker, a senior
at 167-lbs., and Midwest confer-
ence heavyweight champion Don
Cassiday, will probably include:
John Bohannon at 123-1bs., Ned
Budlong loo-lbs, Dick Thomas
at 137-1bs., Marty Hall 147-1135.,
Lee Savage 157»lbs., and Chuck
Adams at l77~lbs. .

If the Isl—lb. class is includ-
ed, either .lohn Larew or Dick
Walker will go for Crinnell.

Crow], George and Bob Mm
Jimsey, and Tom Doyle, began
to Click.

Carlson Held In Check

In the space of three minutes,
Crow] and Musser whittled a
21 point lead to 12 at 51:63.
With about five minutes left in
the game, Larry Koch potted a
two»pointer to reduce the Ram
margin to 57-67, but that was
the Closest Grinnell ventured.
Several close shots were miss-
ed by the Pioneers that might
have changed the picture of the
game.

Tom Doyle was outstanding
in the final minutes with his
shooting and heads-up play.

Don Carlson, the conference's
leading scorer. and John Musser
held each other pretty well in
check, Carlson hitting for only
eleven, and Musser getting only
thirteen.

Grinnell's cage title hopes
suffered a severe jolt when the
Pioneers suffered humiliating
defeats at the hands of both st.
Olaf and Carleton at Northfield
last Friday and Saturday.

The Pioneers were as cold as
the Minnesota weather on both
nights and as a result their
pattern style of play couldn't
offset the torrid shooting of St.
Olaf and Carleton. The [lies
just plain outhustled the pio.
neers and handed them a 73-58
lesson in basketball. In a pa.
thetic exhibition of basketball.
Carleton added injust to in-
jury in a 66-55 win.

With the exception -of John
Musser and George Susens, the
team was off its game. Musser
lived up to his all-conference
rating, but his effort wasn’t

good enough to get Grinnell
home with the wins.

Glinriell has turned the tide in
games at Danby. They have
looked goodin doing so and plan
on a comparable performance
when they take the hardcouzt
tomorrow night.

With the disastrom mad hip
and the Cornell game behind
them, the cagers plan to start
all over, beginning a new win-
ning streak with the Warhburg
some. Stmn_' 'ts are high and the
team- is ready for the new
drive. The conference title isn‘t
out of the picture yet, but the
squad knows that only an all-
out effort in every Single re<
malnlng game will be sufficient.
