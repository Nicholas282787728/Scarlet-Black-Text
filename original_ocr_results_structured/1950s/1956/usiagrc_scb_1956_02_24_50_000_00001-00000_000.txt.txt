Men 0. K. “Spirit” of New CofHP Constitution

, Special Meeting
\ For Unified Stud

Begins Drive
ent Government

By Chuck Stegmeir ‘

“It looks like we’re on
the last four

the way. The developments of
days have produced a start toward unified

student government," Ken Kitsseballm, student council pres~

ident stated yesterday.

“There is a vigorous spirit. among the three governing
bodies and the whole campus seems to be caught up in it.
The Student Organizations committee has offered us further

encouragement, and we are now ,

going ahead to put other ideas
in concrete form.”

A select committee, composed
of Kassebaum; Pat Larrabbe,
League Board president; Tom
Boe, c of HP president; Mary
Mills, and Dick Lehrer, will
meet tomorrow to begin work
on the rough draft of a cone

stitution for unified student
government at Grinnell based
on the ideas brought forth by
a chain of events starting Tues-
day afternoon.

The chain began with a
meeting in Main Lounge at 5
pm. on‘ Tuesday called to
acquaint students and candi—
dates with the workings of
student government.

Most of the 17 students who
attended the meeting were ale
ready active in student govern-
ment. Besides Kassebaum, Pat
Lsrrabee, and Tom Boe, two
candidates for Student Council
president, Pete Kizer and Art
Travers; a member or the c of
HP, Dick Lehrer; the freshman
class president, Jim Jacobson;
three Vmemhers of the Election
Board, Barb Eckstein, Jan
Wenthe,» and John Egan; seven
other students, and Harry Grace,
Dean of Men were present.

Talk about improving student
government led to a discussion
of the new 0 of HP constitu-
tion, which had been submitted
to the men the previous eve-
ning. This discussion, revolving
especially around whether the

. new plan was a blow to hopes
for unifying student government,
was brought to an end by a bit
ter verbal battle.

It was cut off by a sugges-
tion that instead of arguing
about unitying student govern-
ment, the students present at
the meeting should do some-
thing about it immediately.
After a short discussion. this
suggestion was unanimously,
agreed upon and it was de-
aided that all those present
would resolve themselves into
a special committee for the
purpose. A meeting to start
work on a plan for unified,
student government was cau-
ed tor 8:30 pm that evening.

Nineteen students and Dean
Grace were present at the meet-
ing. The new c of HP constitu—
tion was examined to determine
what men’s government might
be like, Kasscbaum pointed out
how it might be adapted to uni-
fied student government. Discus-
sion then centered on what type
of unified student government
would be best, The tentative
system which was considered
best by virtually all of the stu—
dents present is cssentially the
one proposed two years ago. Be-
side a student body president
who would serve as executive
head of the government, a new
central student legislature, com.
posed of members of the Lea-
gue Board and c of HP and
several members at large, would

Present Play
About Bigotry

“Dark of the Moon” is a
timely consideration of bigo-
try and narrow-mindedness,”
said Jim Conover, director.
The show will be given to-
night and tomorrow night at
a in the women‘s gym. Tickets
are available at the door and
in the All}?! box~office.

"Dark of the Moon” includes
elements of comedy. melodrama
and pathos," said Conover. ”It is
folk—drama, containing elements
of song and dance that have
been separted from modern
theatre. it goes back to tradi—
tional theatre, when the actor
had to be able to sing and dance
as well as act. Unlike the cust-
omary ‘well-made’ play with
three acts, ‘Dark or the Moon’ is
divided into nine scenes and
several locales, and is thus well
suited to arena production."

The play was written by
Howard Richardson and Wil—
liam Barney, two graduate
students at the University of
Iowa tor production at lows,
It was produced on hroadway
in 1915 and has been present»
ed frequently by colleges and
little theater groups.

“Dark of the Moon” is the
story of a witch boy who be
Comes human [or ”the love of
Barbara Allen.” Griff Pritchard
and Anne Moore, both freshmen,
play the leading roles. Mrs. Jane
Harnack (women’s physical eds"
ucation) is‘ director of dance.

80% Vote Yes; -
Faculty to See

Resolutions Next

_ By Art Travers

North campus Wednesday
approved the “general spirit”
of the new Council of House
Presidents constitution. The
vote was 277 (roughly 80
per cent) in favor of the pro-
posal and 56 (roughly 20 per
cent) against it. Four hundred
twenty-nine men were eligible
to vote. A simple majority of the
total number of men was re-
quired for passage.

The Student Organizations
committee will vote on the in-
tent of the Constitution next
week. if the committee approv-
es, and the faculty okeys the ,
proposal, it will be returned to
the C of H? for further work.

The overall plan of the new
constitution is two—fold.

Government. Divided

Firstly. the government is di-
VldEd into three areas, legis-
lative, executive and judicial.
Under the present. System the
same ten men perform all three
of these ‘functions. They make
the rules; they enforce them;
and they judge cases or infrac-
tions. This puts the house presi-
dent between the devil and the
proverbial deep blue sea.

He is expected to discharge
his duty to the administration
as a C of HP member. At
the same time he is the pres-
ident of a men’s hall and is
expected to represent any
member or members of his
hall. 11: is clearly impossible
for the house president to
execute both of these fluc-
lions‘ properly.

Accordingly, the legislative
body (Men's Senate) has been
expanded to include lanothel‘
representative from each men’s
hall. This broadens the base of
legislative responsibility. These
meetings will be open to the
public. This was in answer to
attacks made against the pres-
ent closed meeting policy of the
C of HP,

Base tIs Broadened

As the first part 02‘ the C of
HP‘s purpose is explored, the
second becomes clear. The bur-
den of responsibility has been
placed on more shoulders and
the base of government has
been broadened.

In line with this, the new
constitution provides the indi-
Vidual hall councils with power
it enforce regulations and to
report any infraction. In case
of infractions, the offender will
be reported to 'the C of HP
president, who Will notify the
defendant’s house president.

All of these cases Will be
tried before the judicial board.
The judicial is composed of
five justices (one of whom is
the Chief Justice) and two 31-
ternate justices chosen by the
outgoing c of HP. The c of
HP president will act as prose-
cutor and the defendant‘s'hnll
president will act as defense
counsel. If the defendant
wishes he may choose someone
else to act as his counsel.

In most cases the court Will
be closed and Visitors will not
be permitted. “This is to pro-
tect the rights of the accused,”
rxplaincd Dick Lehrer who,
with Tom Eoe, drew up the doc-
ument in its present form. To
make this clearer let us follow
a hypothetical case through
these various departments.
