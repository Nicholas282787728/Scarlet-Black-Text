Goreham ’3 Athletic

by {Pete Kizer

One of Grinnell’s most ver—
satile athletes, Fred “Fritz"
Goreham, has proved that it is
possible to spend time on the
athletic field and still be a
student. While maintaining a
3.1 grade average, he has been
a member of an athletic squad
every semester of his college
career. His four years at Grin-
nell have been characterized by
hard work, determination, and
an inexhausu'ble supply of en-
engy, on and off the field.

The five-foot, eight inch 145-
pound senior from Des Moines
earned numerals his freshman
year in foodball, basketball, and
golf. As a sophomore he um a
member of the varsity football,
basketball, and golf squads,
earning his first Grinnell letter
in golf.

switches to Cross-Country

An accident in his junior year
slowed his athletic career, but
did not stop it. During the first
week of fall football practice
the recurring effects oi 21 child-
hood haad injury forced Fritz
‘to give up the game. He im-
mediately transferred his efr
forts to cross-country, and was
a vital cog in raising the bar-
Tiers‘from ninth place the pre-
vious year to second place in
the IVLidwest conference.

son, Fritz joined the varsily

first semester. Then he was
chosen to represent Grinnell

The title race this year is the
