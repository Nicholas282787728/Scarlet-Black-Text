New Grinnell Social

Highway Brings Unexpected ireubies

By Arlene Cleveland

According to recent tiguros,
summer improvements made in
the town ot Gminoll deal most.

the spring tvcry early in the
morning, too, as say the Main

to sleep through the blast of

mers) was completed Aug. 7.

A recent talk with Grinnell’s
city manager revealed that our

ment to hit the community in
some time. .

-'rhosc who iii-ed through
the detours and barricades
are kind oi being educated
into a new deal. In order to
cross the highway, two sets oi
semiautomatic stop and go
lights have been installed at
Broad and Sixth and at West
and Sixth. These traiiio siE'
nalswill rlash green for us. 3,
and will continue to do so
until pedestrians push a but»

lights to permit saie crossing.

Thanks to the city council,
similarly operated sign ls have
been put in at both Pa r and

acquaintance with most or the
work done during the summer,
and i think I lime iouiid that
the jobs that are overdone (like
the furniture and porch at the
Union) and the jobs that are
underdone (like the Dibble
plumbing) are not the mistakes
of the carpenter, plumber, .or
painter. People in all depart-
ments, from tinanco to toods,
have a hand on tho hammer or
the paint brush, and very Often
their halt-knowledge of what
should be done, or their rciusal
to see anything except the
cracked wall or loalry faucet in
front of them is the factor that
wastes time, wastes money, and
brings questionable results.

Some good technical source or
knowlcdge (which the 'collegc,
in a large part, already has)
should be used in the planning
of campus improvements. A
good buildings and grounds il‘nr
provement program should be
built on something other than
the uninformed and fluctuating
wishes of the
the faculty, and
Coun

other ot the same nature in-
stalled at Park st, There are no
now stop signs, but Of course,
there was the constant rerlot‘atr
ing ot all the old ones, includ-
ing the moving oi railroad
warning signals,

The big schmaltz for those
lucky seniors with cars is the
tact that Grinnell now has a
radar speed check system. Mod»
em electronic speed detectors
act as the seeingrcyCrFrBl. tor
all drivers, and although this
Check has only‘ been in working
condition tor a tow days, suc»
cess ot “Operation ‘Slow-Down”
has been phenomenal.

As tar as 5&3 reporters
can deduce, there is no set
standard fine tor the motor
criminals, as the offenders'
dues. are strictly up to Mayor
Hotchhin. The arrest involves
a bit oi an interview with
His Honor. which a member
or our staff will vouch tor,
as he has already contributed
his debt (SSS) to society.
American Automobile associari
tion lists the town of Grinncll
on its maps in red, designating
the fact that recommended ac-
commodations arc to be tound
here. However, with all the im-
provomcnts to be had now, the
host printing of the maps will
no doubt put Grinncll up in.
