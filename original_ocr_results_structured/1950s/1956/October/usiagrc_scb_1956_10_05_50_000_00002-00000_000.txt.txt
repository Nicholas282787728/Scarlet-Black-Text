Displaced Persons

When calling Read basement last Wednesday, we were
surprised to hear a freshman woman answer the phone in
a ”notoriously beautiful” manner, We wondered what a
freshman woman was doing in an upperclass women’s hall.
After investigation, we found that there were two women
in Read basement, and five women in l-laines basement. Both
Read and Haines are for upperclass women.

During the first week, the women were living in upper-
class halls, but were affiliated with a freshmen hall. How—
ever, now the women have full privileges of their respective
upperclass halls.

There could be several reasons for this mix-up. The
most obvious is that there was no more space in the fresh-
men halls to accomodate seven additional girls. Added to
this could be the fact that the women registered late, and
the college couldn't refuse to turn down seven outstanding
women. However, whatever the reason, the condition illus-
trates an inconsistent policy which should be remedied

If there is going to be empty space in halls for upper-
class women, and if freshmen halls are filled to capacity,
and if freshmen women will be placed wherever there is a
vacancy, why have freshmen halls? Many 'women wish they
could remain in the same hall under a system which the men
practice. Indeed, many Women become attached to their
hall and remain there for their last three years.

It now seems apparent that the three freshmen halls
are inadequate. Last year, freshmen were living on Haines
third; two years ago, in Read basement. It is time to be
consistent, instead of practicing only half a policy.

We hope the freshmen aren‘t too unhappy because they
are missing the chance to live with their classmates Living
in their present halls, they will probably enjoy a fuller

, life, and will become better integrated into the college com»
munity, in a quicker time.

Golfers’ Dilemma

Recent vandalism on the golf course has jeopardized
the privileges of students. Over 700 dollars of damage was
done last week. Holes were put into the greens, and ﬂags
were stolen from the course.

Vandalism has been occuring ever since college has

been in session. Therefore, the damage is attributed to col-
lege students.

The golf course management has threatened to talge
away student privileges—even from the golf team. This
would mean that the team would have to travel to Newton,
in order to practice and participate in ”home" meets. _

The vandals are performing a disservice to both the
students, and the college’s standing in the community. Per-
haps in the immediate future, upperclassmen will learn to
be responsible for themselves, as well as trying to be re—
sponsible for freshmen. ,

Capifu/ Commenfary

By Tom Skomia
and Lynn Parsons

Washington this week has
been highlighted in the main
by the activities of the House
Subcommittee on the District of
Columbia, The four Democratic
members, all from below the
Mason-Dixon line, are staying
here in Washington by virtue of
the fact that they are assured
of rte—election and need not
campaign. The other Northern
members are at home, mending
their fences.

The Southerners have seized
upon this opportunity, and are
using the subcommittee as a
sounding board for their pro-
segregationist views on cducn.
tion. These representatives of
some of the last vestiges of
feudalism in the Western
world are parading witness
after witness before them in
an attempt, not at free in-
quiry, but to elicit a series of
predetermined cone 1 u s i o n s
which they themselves arrived
at decades ogo and of which

they will never let go as long
as they live.

The leading question, the in—
nuendo, the slanted statement,
all of the methods of the profes-
sional investigator; they are all
here, Your writers witnessed
two such hearings, and they
provided a sharp reminder that
such tactics are prevalent wher-
ever small minds congregate, no
matter what their party affiliar
lion. ,

Mr. Eisenhower. apparentlyi
viewing Democratic campaign

will be barred.

Sackclolh
And

Ashes

By Gene Thompson

It seems that a few of my
readers have been losing sleep
because they find it difficult to
attach any significance to the
title of this column.

“sackcloth and ashes" is a
phrase popularly associated with
the religious fanatic: appalled
by the wickedness of his fellow
men, he clothed himself in sack-
cloth (or, in extreme cases, a
hair shirt) and heaped ashes on
his head, accompanying this lit-
zle demonstration with much
weeping and wailing. The idea
was that he could suffer per-
sonally for the sins of society,

To associate "sackcloth and
ashes" with'this column may
require a tremendous stretch
oi the imagination, but if you
substitute [or the reIIgimIs fa.
natic a student with n pencil,
and substitute for the weep-
ing and wailing the scratching
of that pcncii on a piece of
paper, 1 think the phrase
should acquire some small Sig»
niflcanco. if you still don’t
get the idea, don‘t let it drive
you to drink.

(I am more or less convinced
that I could call the column
“Cornflakes and Cream,” ”Rum
and Coca-Cola" or “Arsenic and
Old Lace” and it would have
little effect one Way or the
other.)

To the Editor:

I can see It coming out of the
corner of my eye, coming just
as inevitably as the winter
snows. Some very bright prep-
master is soon going to be
struck by a veritable brain-
storm. a 100% original idea,
never heard of before—except
by prep-masters for each of the
seven years I have been at Grin-
hell.

The idea? To illustrate Dar-
win‘s theory of the origin of
the human species by draping

through a maximum bruterforce
effort on the part of the indi~
vidual player. The smooth, trainc
ed effort of teamwork that is
employed on the varsity field
is absent in the bone-breaking
mixups seen in intramurals.

Am I being too much of an
alarmist if I express the opinion
that lM football should be
abolished, and the sooner the
better?
