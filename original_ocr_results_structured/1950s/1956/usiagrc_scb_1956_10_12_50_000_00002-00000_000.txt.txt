“Yeah .' Rah ! Team I”?

Spectator spirit at last week's football game was
shamefully low. Cheers were uninspired, dull and trite.

“Yah! Rah! Team!” has little originality,

enthusiasm.

We felt that tlle cheerleaders were making half-heart-
ed attempts to promote enthusiasm. The leaders also lack-

ed practice, for they had to
turning to the crowd.

practice in a huddle before

There should be some revision of the cheer repertory.
Organized cheers are so long that they continue when play
has resumed. As a result, they end weakly. There is no
variety; the same few cheers are repeated many times.

There are no cheers for the

team at the end of a game,

and there is no organized cheer for the end of a Grinnell

victory.

The team should have been backed more enthusiastical-
ly in their initial home performance. We hope that both
the cheerleaders and the spectators will improve in future
games. A pep club with definite membership will help.

Short and snappy

cheers will help. But most important, an

enthused crowd cooperating with good cheerleaders is a
necessity.

Capifa/ Commentary

By Tom Skornia
and Lynn Palsons

It being about time that we
made at least passing mention
about the progress of the pro-
gram here, we felt that a few
lines this week would do the
trick. The last weekend was
highlighted by an institution
known to Washington Semester
students as “Buffet and Story-
Telling at Dean Vander slices.”
The buffet is more than edible
and the stories more than hu~
morous, with the special butt
of a sizeable number of jokes
this particular evening bcing
Mr. R. E. Goosetree, our unit
adviser.

Activities during the week
included seminars with indi—
vidnal and committee staff
members, all or whom were
cooperative under questioning,
with the exception oi one,
namely, the professional Staﬂ
assistant to the Senate Com-
mittee on Government Opel-a-
tions, Whose erstwhile ranking
Repul‘llican and ell-chairman
is Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy
of many—hearing fame.

Upon being questioned about
the activities of the Permanent

Investigations Subcommittee, the
staff assistant was quick to re-
spond with wholly irrelevant
answers, so the line of question.
ing was dropped.

in the way of Committee in-
vestigations, we will have much
more to say next week, upon
the Conclusion of two new gas

log on in the city, namely, the
inquiry on campaign expendi.
turcs being conducted by the
Subcommittee on Elections and
Privileges of the Senate Rules
and Administration committee,
under chairman Albert Gore
(1)., Tenn), and the probe by
the Senate Select committee on
lobbying, under the chairman-
ship of Senator McClellan (0.,
Ark). Both these should be re.
vcaling oi the great amounts of
grcen involved in politics, on
the part both of parties and of
pressure groups.

Someone once said that the
main business oi Washington
is politics, and alter a brici
glance at the dresses, lapels,
auto bumpers and buildings oi
the no. area, one can see
that this is true. From what
we can see, the average Ike
or Adlai enthusiast this year
is being potentially equipped
with the most outlandish bar-
rage oi political gadgets imag-
inable.

Are you an Adlai fan? It so;
you‘re not fully outfitted these
days unless you have either a
pair of Adlai-Estes earrings
(they’re atrocious) or an Adlai

combination tie clasp and money
clip. For GOP wearing apparel,
there are lke dresses like that
of Mary Mills, parasols and
lighhup bow ties,

Perhaps the most popular
and unique single item being

Commentary
Cont. p. 5, col. 1

By Gene Thompson
According to the catalog,
Grinnell College is Situated in
“Grinnell, a city of nearly 7000
persons. about 300 miles
west of Chicago, and 50 miles
east of Des Moina.” This puts
us right in the middle of her
where, and it has occurred to
me that a new student from a
big city might be confused by
this phenomena of the small
American town.

For this reason, I thought we
might take a Short (our of the
town, while I point out some
of the more interesting fea-
tures.

Joe's While Split is the first
place to meet the eye on the
“will route downtown. The
only Word to describe Joe‘s is
“Iunctlonal.” The compact
kitchen and dining room make
Ilse or every available inch
01 space, and Joe has develop—
ed restaurant methods that
may revolutionize the busi-
ness. Here you can grab a
quick hamburger when you
can’t beat the thought of
gristly stew or watery maca-
ronl in the dining room.

If you turn left after Joe's,
you find that Broad Street un-
folds before you, as far as the
eye can see — to the railroad
tracks. One block down Broad
street, we find the "square," a
solid block of buildings with
cars Circling around it.

After seven p.m. on any night
of the week, these cars are

driven by teen-age “soods” _ a

“seed" who is trying to he a
“hood.” They are distinguishable
by the cars they drive: mostly
Fords and Chevvies with dual
acrials, fender skirts and Smit.
ty mufflers _ and there are a
few second-hand Cadillacs. (They
never drive in anything but
second gear, so as to be able to
slow down and stop for any
dollic that might happen to
come out or Davis’ ice Cream
parlor.)

As you walk around the
square, don’t miss the follow-
ing attractions. The news
stand is the center of Grinncll
intellectual activity. At inst
check, they were oiiering n
wide variety of detective
magazines with stories titled
“Sin, Scandal, Sex and Death"
and “Fourteen Slashes in Her
snortic Nitegown."

The Poweshiek bank, on the
next corncr, was designed by a
iamous architect named Sulli-
van, a pioneer in steelsnd-con.
erete construction, who fancied

that this bank should look like'

a brick vault. And it does, I

guess, except for the little gold
lions crawling all over the
front.

'l‘ul'ning right around the
square: Wayne's Steak House,
where steaks are fine and‘ the
amber fluid ﬂows freely, and
Cunningham drug, where every-
thing is packaged neatly and
displayed under glaring lights.

Around the corner again,
the biggest attraction here is
thc theaters — the strand,
which runs thc popular ex-
travaxlganns in vista-vision,
and the Iowa, which oitcn cu-
ters to collcgintc tastes with a

mer only the strand is open,
and it plays iilrns like “Fury
at Gunsight Pass” and “Black-
jack Ketchum — Desperado,"

with a C-grade Tarzan movie '
now and then.

Well, the sun is sinking slow-
ly behind the water tower, and
I am running out of space. Let’s
get back to the campus.

that 1M football should go, and.
