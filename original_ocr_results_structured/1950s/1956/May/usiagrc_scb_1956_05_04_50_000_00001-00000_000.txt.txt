Student Council voted unanimously last night to accept proposals by President . , .
Howard R. Bowen to have the college accept full responsibility for the development of “how auditorium at 8 tonight.
The show is a combination of individual and group
The proposals call in part for immediate purchase of an acre of land adjoining dances and has a variety of humorous, dramatic and satiri-
the present college property on the east (lake) side. Cost of the land is estimated at

Lake Acre.

$700.

The plans were included in a
letter from Bowen to Student
Council President Art Travers.
Other proposals are as follows:

The installations of a well and
pump for drinking water and
cooking purposes. The cost of
this improvement is estimated
at $800.

The addition of bunkhouse
wings to the present building
for overnight accommodations”
construction of a second foot-
bridge on the east approach to
the property, provision of pic—
nic tables and other fireplaces
and fence improvements.

Bowen said he salt the “nets
ture and size oi the require—
ments for adequate develop—
ment of Lake Acre go beyond
what might be reasonably ex-
pected or students of Grinnell
college.” He said that while
the college will assume the
financial responsibiilty for the
project, utilization of the iacil-
ities will remain with the stu—
dents.

Bowen pointed out that. an
important advantage in the col-
lege’s financial requirements of
Lake Acre was that it will pro-
vide continuity of the program
which it has lacked in the past.
It gives “assurance of . . . sta»
bility in the long-range develo .
ment program which otherwise
is dependent on yearrhy-year ac.
tion of successive generations of
students and Student Councils,"
he said.

The full development of
Lake Acre is not likely to be
carried out immediately,
