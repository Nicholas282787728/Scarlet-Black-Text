Coach Bernie Hesclton 0
Lawrence brings his Vikes to
Pioneer land tomorrow for what
Grinnell’s stalwarts are sure is
going to be the Vikings' third
dunking of the year. The Apple-
ton, Wis, squad will be inprime
condition to jump back to the
win side of the column after
having had the misfortune to
fall to the co-favorites for the
Midwest conference, St. Olaf
and Coe, in its first two games.
However, Grinnell coach “Pete”
Peterson will field a determined
team with two weeks of rigor-
ous practice between them and
their 26-0 defeat at the hands
of Coe. Both teams will be at
each other's throats when they
hit the gridiron tomorrow aft-
ernoon and Pioneer fans should
see a bang-up game of football.

After the dust settled over
the I.M. football fields last
Tuesday, Jim Gabriclson of
Cowles was in the infirmary
with a brain concussion, Brook
Peterson of Clark was in the
hospital with injuries to the
muscles of one leg, and John
Phillips of Gowles was nurs-
ing a} broken collar-bone. This
unfortunate and unusual day
in intramural Iootball has giv-
en its opponents an excuse to
say, “I told you so," and
scream long and loudly about
the hazards of this game play-
edby men not in condition, not
protected by pads, etc.

John Truesdale, chairman of
intramural athletics, and his stun
dent assistant, John Wallace, de-

fend l,M. football, pointing out
that last year there were only
three minor injuries and that
the injuries occurring Tuesday
were a result of nothing but co-
incidence. 1 am definitely in the
Truesdale-Wallnce camp.

For the interest of those who
don’t know, I.M. football as
played at Grinnell is the touch
brand in which the ball carrier
is not tackled but must be tag-
ged with both hands between
his shoulders and his knees.
Blockers are not allowed ‘ to
leave their feet in down-field
blocking, Protection includes a
helmet andhowever many shirts
and pairs of pants the player
cares to wear.

Concerning the injuries re-
ceived Tuesday none were the
result of rough play and, in
my rather amateur opinion,
they could not have been
avoided by better condition«
ing in the men or more pro-
tectivc equipment. Shoulder
pads might have prevented
Phillips' broken bone but it
incurred in a fall on the field
the likes of which could hap-
pen to any of us while stum-
bling down the dark halls of
ARI! firm“ of bed in the
morning,

If football were dropped as
the I.M. sport in the fall, What
could be substituted? Some of
the opponents to the program
have suggested that soccer be
Substituted. This might be fine
except for the fact that football

replaced soccer several years
ago as the intramural sport due
, to a rash of broken legs. Sc
soccer is out.

I think that the whole thing
is a tempest in a teapot and as
the season progresses the lack
of injuries will show that I.M.s
aren’t as vicious as they are
claimed to be by some individ-
uals.

Defeal St. Olaf In Opener 26-39

The Grinnell varsity cross—
country squad led by captain
Larry Schaleger defeated St.
Olaf college in their first dual
meet of the season to the tune
of 26-39 at Northﬁeld, Minn,
last Saturday.

Competing over a course
gruelling enough to try the old.
est veterans, the squad, despite
the fact that it has not as yet
achieved the peak of condition,
revealed enough staying power
to nose out St. Olaf on their
home course. Captain Schaleger
turned in a fitting performance
to lead the field with a time of
14:28 over the 2.6 mile course.
st. Olaf took second and third
while Noel Bacchus of Grinnell
was fourth; St. Olaf took fifth
and Chuck Yoak, John Weldon,
and Bob Downs came in sixth,
seventh, and eighth, respectivc~
ly.

Interviewed after the race, the
captain of the defeated st. Olaf
team said that his team was
not in as good condition as he
could have wished and hoped
that the next meeting at the
Midwest conference would have
a different result.

CowIes, Smith Tie
For 2nd In IM's

As the first week of I-M
football draws to a close specu»
lations increase, along with the
casualty list.

On Monday, North Younker
met Dibble for the only second
half upset of the week. Early
in the first quarter Bob Sher-
man of Dibble intercepted a
pass intended for Mchmsey and
scored. Dibble led 6-0 at the
half. then North began to roll,
scoring in the third quarter on
a 10 yard toss from Larry Koch
to George Mchmsey, and again
in the fourth as Koch hit Mc-
iimsey again for 25 yards. The
point after was scored through
another Koch pass, this time to
D. Crowl. Koch‘s throwing was
the best yet reported. He con-
nected with 15 of 20. The final
score, Dibble six and North 13.

Also on Monday, the other
Younker team tackled the
highly rated Smith. A fourth
quarter running pass from
Smith’s cxclbstctcr John
Copeland was the deciding
factor. The play was repeated
for the extra point, leaving
the ﬁnal score 1-0 in favor of
Smith. Bud Rogge caught the
TD pass and Dave DeLong
gathered in the extra point.
The game was a toss-up until
South‘s defense slipped.

On Tuesday Langan and Clark
clashed. The result was a 12»D
win for Laugan with scores
coming in the second and third
quarters. Tally number one
ended a long march when
Rockne slipped through guard.
Kennedy sprinted to pay dirt
soon after that, on an intercepa
lion. .

Here is the line~up which
Langon named: starting guards
were Golden and Murrey; at
center was McCormac; holding
down the ends were Palesch and
Crotty; the backs were Rockne,
Kennedy and Tanouye. Clark’s
Brook Peterson was taken to
the hospital with torn leg
muscles.

Grinnell's defending Midwest
conference cross-country champs
go for victory number two in
tomorrow’s meet with Lawrence
at 1 pm. starting on the foot—
ball field.

Victorious at St. Olaf last
week in the season’s opener,
the Pioneers rule slight favo-
rites in their first home meet.
Lawrence is led by captain
Chuck Merry. Like Grinnell,
the Wiscolsin squad lost its
number one man of last year,
Doug l-lngen, who twice was
runner-up in the conference
meet.

Grinneli’s well-balanced con-

tingent includes Noel Bacchus,
John Welden, Chuck Yoak, Bob
Downs, Bill Elliott, Gottfried
Richter and captain Lari-y
Schaleger. Bacchus, Welden, Ei-
liott, Downs and Schaleger have
each earned a letter in track or
cross-country or both.

Rival coaches A. C. Denny
of Lawrence and Irv Simone
of Grinnell have agreed to
run the golf course layout in-
stead of the flat cross-cam-
pus course since the golf
course measures somewhat
shorter than the regulation
three miles.

The starting line is at the
Southeast corner of Ward field
and the race ends in front of
the grandstand. The course recA
0rd of 15 min. 47 sec. is held
by George Drake and was set
in 1954.

Cowles, though. John Phillips
received a broken calla-bone
and Jim Gabrielson suffered a
concussion. Cowlcs starting
line-up was: Harper, Hurst,
Hodsou, Covalt, Jacobson,
Gray, Gabrielson and Wilson.

South made up for its Monday
defeat by trampling Rawson
12.0 on Thursday. The 'I'D’s
came as Bob Mchmsey made a
remarkable an yard punt re-
turn in the first quarter, and
then Kantzler, the league’s lead-
ing receiver grabbed a Mchm-
sey throw in the end zone with
30 seconds left in the half.

starting for Rawson were:
Jaffe and Hocky at ends, Jantz
and orcnwall at guards, Van.

dernord at center, and Alamedal

backfield.

Meanwhile, another onersided
victory took piece. North
smeared Langan 25.0. In the
first quarter Mchmsey scored
on a Koch pass and John Olsen
also caught a Koch toss for six
points. Again in the third quar-
ter, Koch connected this time to
Crow]. John Olsen racked up
his second TD

quarter on an interception.

Lawrence college will invade
Ward Field tomorrow afternoon
at 1:30 intent to avenge a 45 to
13 set~back dealt them by the
Pioneers last season. The
weatherman has promised to co-
operate.

Playing its home opener after
a week layvoff the Grinnell var-
sity will the out to break into
the Win column for the first
time. The Pioneers were shut:
out at One two weeks ago 26-0.

Lawrence hasn’t been able
to win a game this year either,
being beaten first by St. Old
31 to 13, and then by One 19
to 0 last Saturday. However,
Dial and Cue are rated among
the top three in the confer-
ence. ”That Lawrence team
looks tough. They’re no push-
over," Pioneer coach Bob rev
erson said in a re-evalllatlon
oi the Vikings after watching
movies of their two games.

Our varsity has been hearing
down in defense preparation
this week because the movies
showed that Lawrence moved
the ball well against Coe’s
tough, veteran line. Daily SCX‘llTh

son is out due to a bruised
leg. Also a sophomore, Gary

Nolder is expected to move to
the tackle position allowing
Bob Grindy to take over cen-
ter duties. Steve Bauserman
and Lee Moses have been
hampered by leg injuries too,
and aren’t likely to see much‘
action.

Lettermcn and co-captains
Dick Thomas and John Larew
will start at their regular posi-
tions. Both were mainstays in
the Grinnell lineup last season,

and are in good shape now.
Thomas, smallest man on the
team, plays end. Larew is
“toughman” in the middle of

the line, playing guard.

Jerry Kurth will ‘be at a
tackle and Darrell Fisher, also
a letter winner last season, is
expected to be stationed at the
other guard. In the backfield
Jim Burkett, a transfer, is
counted on as quarterback, with
