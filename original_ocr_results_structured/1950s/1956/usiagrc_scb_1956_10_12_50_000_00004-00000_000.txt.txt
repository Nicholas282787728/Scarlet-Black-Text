Evans OOEoses Hickenlooper DinnerrWelcomes Players Announce '5

For Conl'rol O'F

By Bob Barr

On Nov. 6 the people of lowa
will elect a member oi the
United States Senate. This elec—
tion is of great national im—
portance because the political
makeup of the U. 5. Senate
may well hang upon its out.
come.

Iowans are indeed fortunate
to have as their candidate on
the Republican ticket a man
who has served lows and the
nation faithfully and well for
the past 22 years—the Honor-
able Bourke B. Hickenlooper.

I believe that Senator Hicken-
looper deserves the votes of ev—
ery Iowan because of his past
experience and performance, and
because of the things he be-
lieves in. Bourke Hickcnlooper
began his public service in 1934
when he was elected a state
representative from Linn coun-
ty. He served two terms there
and in 1938 was elected to the
office of lieutenant governor.

In 1942, Hick was elected
governor. His administration
was marked by a rise in the
state's surplus to $54,000,000,
a reduction in taxes, the start
oi a school code, the estab-
lishment of modern court pro.
cedure in Iowa and the adopa
tion or state aid to dependent
children.

In 1944 Hickcnlooper was
elected to the senate, where he
has served ever since. During
this time he has served as
chairman of the Joint Commit.
tee on Atomic Energy, and as
an intluential member of the
Senate Committees on Agricul-
ture and Foreign Affairs. These
and other key assignments give

Iowa a strong voice in the afv

fairs of our nation.

Although representing a pre—
dominantly agricultural state,
Hick has put principle above
political expediency and has
vigoro'usly supported President
Eisenhower's economically sound
farm program.

Unlike his Democratic op-
ponent, Hickenlooper realizes
that a successful iarni pro-
gram must consider the inter-
ests of the economy as a
whole and not merely the
Short-range interests of the
farmers He believes that the
current function of govern»
ment is to do for the people

Senale Seal

By Dave Fleck
lowa seams to be returning to
the two-party system with the
emergence upon the political
battleground of some highly
touted Democratic nominees.
The most widely known and re-
spected of these is none other
than the venerable R. M. ”Spike"
Evans who is attempting to una
seat the present incumbent in
the Senate.

The tone of “Spike’s” campaign
illustrates his high character
and affability. Now in the proc—
ess of conducting a whirlwind
campaign which gives him all
the earmarks of a man to be
reckoned with in the November
election, Mr, Evans stands for
several proposals which definite

ly have appeal in this predomg

inantly agricultural state.

Experience on the regional
AAA board in the 1930's and
in formulating the New Deal
farm program has enabled
“Spike" to put together a sat-
isfactory and easily under-
standable farm plank.

The combination of the Demr
ocratic highrrigidaprice-supports
theme with the Democratic
”Soil conservation bank" into his
farm policy represents a solu-
tion which hits at the heart of
the farm problem of rising costs
and falling prices. Although the
Republicans have claimed that
this program has led to huge
surpluses, they have been una
able to solve this problem as
is illustrated by even higher
farm surpluses under the flexi-
ble-price-support theory.

Being content with only one
basic policy is not Mr. Evans’
claim to fame. He has con»
sistently charged the present
administration, Senator Hick-
enlooper in particular, with
allowing the international
prestige of the United States
to go dribbling down the drain.

only those things which they ‘

cannot better d0 for them-

selves.

His philosophy Of human liba
eralism and economic conserva»
tism stands in refreshing opposi-
tion to the Democrats policy of
spend and spend, tax and tax,
control and control.
