Administrative Action

The policy and rule changes announced by President
Howard R. Bowen this afternoon clearly show the adminis—

tration’s cooperative, yet thoughtfully deliberative spirit in
matters concerning student problems.

Cars are usually always mentioned in any discussion
concerning Grinnell’s social problems. We agree with Mr.
Bowen that perhaps the disadvantages of having cars have
not received as careful consideration by students as the
advantages, Nevertheless, seniors’ cars on an experimental
basis for the entire next year seems to us a just and realis-
tic answer for this perennial problem Consideration of par‘
ental, faculty, alumni, trustee, and finally student opinion
Was involved in his decision, but we feel that President
Bowen‘s action should be acceptable to all.

We are more enthused about final passage of voluntary
class attendance, placing more responsibility on the indi-
vidual student. As we have stated previously, the ideals
expressed in the new system are not merely hollow state«
ments from a college catalog, but are now meaningful ob—
servations. We thank both tlle faculty and President
Bowen for their decision

It was fitting that Mr. Bowen announced these changes
in an all student meeting in ARH auditorium. This after-
noon‘s meeting was the second of this type this semester.
The semi-formal atmosphere, offering opportunity for ques-
tions, is one of the greatest factors contributing to.under-
standing between the student body and administration, an
opportunity not achieved through a more formal convoca-

tion-type approach.

Campus Beauty

Spring moving is affecting central campus on a full
scale. Office relocation ill the Student Union, ‘Y' building
and Blair hall have become objects of the Buildings and
Grounds department’s mass moving attack.

The department is on a full-speed schedule, but we
wonder if it’s necessary for the movers to drive across cen-
tral campus as though it were highway sih. Truck tires
have dug into the mud so deeply, that it'_ probably take
the remainder of spring for campus restoration. We thought
there was a move to beautify the campus. Why give it set-
backs before it even starts? ’ _ .

Campus sidewalks seem to be sufficiently Wide for
the trucks. It would be better for this spring’s grass if
there were footprints on the lawn, and tire treads on the

walks.

To The Editor:

We, the women of Cleveland,
are disturbed by the easy pass-
age by several halls of League
Board’s proposal for Student
council representation on south
campus. We would like to‘ rec-
ommend further consideration of
the problem.

The proposed system would
provide for electing uppcr-
class representatives at large
to he placed in freshman balls
as baffle board. We feel that
an upperclassman thus elected
would represent upperclass-
men, not the hall, virtually
all ircshmcn. We bciicvc that
the representative should be
elected irom the hall and by
the hall. '

Therefore, we would like to
make the following suggestions:
1. That freshmen women Stur
den! Council members be elect-
all under the present system. 2.
That a baffle board member
should accompany her to the
first fcw meetings, the hall re<
taining only one vote. 3. That a
training-program in student gov-
ernment specifically designed to
orient new representatives but
open to all interested persons

$500 Gift Grani-

Grinnell is one of 50 colleges
and universities to receive a
financial grant from the Johns-
Manville Sales Corp. this year,

President Howard R. Bowen an»
nounced Tuesday.

Grinnell‘s grant of $500 is to
be used according to the needs
of the college. It is part of a
two-year program adopted by
the corporation to give financial
aid to lol) institutions. The
other 50 institutions selected will
receive grants in 1957.

be conducted at the beginning
of each school year.

It has been suggested that
such a “breaking in" period
would he disrupting to the
workings of Student Council.
We point out the present sys-
tem on north campus or hav-
ing new representatives begin
in the spring.

We feel the freshmen, with
the training program, are as
capable as upperclassmcn in
helping to conduct the affairs
of the school. New ideas and
enthusiastic spirit are invaluable
to Grinnell.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Counci/
Corner

By Art Travers

(llhe Student Council-League
Board sponsored change in the
election of south campus rope
resentaLives to the Council has
hit some snags. Much of the feel»
ing against the measure, I feel,
stems from; confusion. I should
like to take this space to explain
the change and present some
reasons for my supporting it.

Under the new method sev-
en women (two for Loose)
would be elected from a slate
of nominees in the manner of
the present League Board elec»
IiDM. Inastnuch as the women
who wore assigned to fresh-
man dorms would have to be
baffle board, they would
have to appear on two siolcs,
onc for freshmen halls, one
for upperclass halls. oiiiy
sophomores and juniors would
be on the fomer, but [resh-
rncn could be elected on the
latter. This would mean that
those girls assigned on fresh—
men dorms would be juniors
and seniors, in accordance with
e 'sting baffle board regula-
tions. That basically is the
change. Why is it good?

It is one more step towards
unified government, since mem—
honest-large will be elected to
the central legislature.

It eliminates a major differ-
ence bet/ween north and south
campus inasmuch as there are
no freshmen serving on the
Council as representatives from
men’s halls.

It enalblas the students to be,
came heltel’ acquainted with the
capabilities of their represents»
lives.

it would mean that representa-
tives from inen’s halls and was
men’s hall's would be elected at
the same time providing for a
more stable council.

The major/objection to the
move has been the removal of
freshmen Women as ball rep-
rcsentalivcs. This argument is
not as strong as it appears at
iii-sl ginncc for the following
reasons:

l—Freshmen are still l‘epre»
sented by the president and vice-
presidant of their class.
Z—Fl‘eshmen are free to come
to Sludent Council and present
any proposal if they feel their
hall represent tWe will not do
an adequliatc job. ‘
shinadcquatc representatives
may be impeached by ‘tlhe hall.

4—Fl‘eshn'len will be emoul‘r
aged to serve on any temporary
committees set up by Lhe Counr
cll.

1 don't believe the importance
of this move can be over-empha~
sized. lI ask only that the Stu-
dents consider very carefully be-
fore they reject this amendment.
If they consider carefubly
enough, I aim confident that the
amendment will be approved.

Young Republicans
Attend Convention

Fifteen members of the Young
Republicans club will travel to
Des Maine: after spring vacation
lo attend the Des Moines district
caucus and state Republican
presidential convention on April
E.

The 15 delegates, who will be
elected at the April 4 meeting
of the club, will be seated as a
regular county delegation with-
out vote. They will meet speak-
ers of the convention and prob
ably other state politicians.

Ed Morrison, president pro
tom of the club said, “We be-
have all college- students
should have a working knowl-
edge of our political system.
We intend to cducaic the in.
terested Republicans hero on
this campus. A knowledge of
politics is a necessity for any
who wish to become leaders.”
A current project of the or-
ganization is to get absentee bal—
lots of 21-year olds on campus

wishing to vote in primary elecA
tions. Anyone interested in i0'
ing the club may Contact Morri-

Busy Placement Bureau Provides
Seniors With Job Opportunities

By Marv Olsen

One of the busiest offices on campus at this time of
year is the Testing and Placement bureau, directed by
Givens L. Thornton ~(psychology) and located in the dean
of men’s office. Beginning in January and continuing
through April, representatives from 35 different business
and industrial organizations have been or will be on campus
to intel'View graduating seniors for future employment, And
this figure does not include the many representatives of
school districts who meet ———-—
with education majors, or
