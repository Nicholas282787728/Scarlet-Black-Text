Election Feature

Cont, from p. 3

the LB president at the time
could lie maid of honor at a
wedding in Cedar Rapids. Last
year found the new League
Board, alter an initiation
treasure hunt, spending a
, quiet evening in the city jail.
Drinking was present. You

could walk into the loggia or
into any women's hall and see
our fair ladies toting paper cups
full of wine with them where—
cvcr they went, 0n the men’s
side, you were fortunate if you
could see the hall in order to
search for a paper cup, let
alone fill it with wine.
y The men then had a colorful
bunch ot maids who cleaned
daily and made their beds.
Spring riots were wilder, sui—
‘dent Council conventions were
more legitimate, and prepping
was much longer,

Dibble and Clark were
lending and water-ﬁghting.
One winter morning found the
entrance way to lasLyeai-‘s
bookstore completely ﬁlled
with snow. The year that
Grinnell tied ior rim place
in the Midwest basketball
conference saw all proiessoi-‘a
oifice doors so badly gummed
up that the administnﬂun was
iorced to call a sirlp day.

A Spring Day in 1943 saw the
c of HP laying a sidewalk be-
tween ARH, the bookstore and
the library. 1950 saw old Lea»
guc Board members wearing the
same iormal to the same League
Board dinner two years in a
row. Joint parties between the
LE and the c of HP were
much happier, and the Dibble
Eagle was still considered the
top trophy in all Grinnell, once
upon a time . . _

Cont, irom p. 2
eleven lines long, in the middle
of an articles listing the play‘s
time, place and cast.

In the same edition, we find
iorty—seven lines worth oi
study—hall and baby—sitting ‘
rules under an article sup»
posedly about League Board
elections. Also eighteen lines
telling us to note that Mchm-
say is noting that nothing is
going on in student CounciL
if this truly reflects interest
on Grinnell campus, flne—pl‘lnt‘
it. But i say it doesn't. I say
lthat more people read “Sack-
icloth and Ashes" and the “let-
wars to the Editor" than read the
ilists or the sports. I'm also will.
;ing to bet that they would read
ireviews, commentaries or even
lay opinions on functions as
high-falutingly intellectual as
chapel talks, coffee hour discus»
sions, and concerts. Who knows?
They might even get interested
enough to go to the next one

Yours sincerely,
