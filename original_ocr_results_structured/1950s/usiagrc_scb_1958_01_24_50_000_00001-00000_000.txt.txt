College Employment Policy

Regarding employment for
next fau, Anderson commented
that “any changes made by
Saga in this respect must be ap-
proved by the college." He stat-
ed, however, that “the people
who really need employment
shall have it. Saga in a way is
an employee of the college_and
must abide by college policy,"

Merrill Foundation
Sponsors Lecturer
For March Series

J. Kenneth Galbraith, pro»
fessor of economics at Har-
vard university, is to give
five lectures here on "The
Nature of Social Myth” dur-
ing the week of March 17.

Galbraith is to be in residence
here for the Week and will be
available to students and. facul-
ty for discussions and confer-

ence.

The Merrill foundation for
the Advancement of Financial
Knowledge, Inc., is giving the
college the money for the lec-
turer and will pay for the pub-
lication or his lectures if Grin-
nell decides to publish them.

The foundation was begun
in 1945‘by Charles E. Merrill,
who was joined by his part-
ners in the brokerage and in-
vestment banking firm, Mer—
rill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
and Boone. .

Galbraith is director of the
agriculture and marketing re-
search department at Harvard.
He has been an administrator in
the office of Price Administra—
tion, director of the Office of
Economic Security policy in the
State department, chief econo—
mist of the American Farm
Bureau federation and a mem-
ber of the board of editors of
Fortune magazine. Two of his
hooks are “American Capital-
ism" and “A Theory of Price
Control.”

Of the purposes of the foun-
dation, Merrill said in 1945, “The
United States is now at one of
the major crossroads of its his-
tory. Political and economic
systems and beliefs which dif—
fer profoundly from ours are
growing up in other countries
throughout the world. Coupled
with their challenge to our de-
mocracy is the need within our
own country for a better under-

a larger measure of success.”

Both men emphasized that
Saga would not try to insti—
tute any “radical" changes,
but rather an “evolutionary”
program to tailor its service
to the needs and likes of the
student body.

At the meeting, Saga officials
stressed a “co-operation" baa
tween Saga and the student

Ohio. Directors in individual
colleges then alter the menus to
fit the needs and policies of
the colleges.

The secondaserving policy
for "all meals cxccpt the char-
coal—broiled steak on Saturday
night” is made possible by
their principle of a “minimum
or waste."

Anderson suggested, as an ex-
ample of this policy, orange
juice in the morning. One glass
is permitted on the first trip
through the line. Anyone want—
ing more, may go back to the
line and take another. And an-
other. etc., one by one, provide
ed he wastes none. The same
principle applies at all meals.

Never Lost A Customer
Saga food service had its the-

body for improvement of food ,
service. "We went to serve stu- '

dents what they want to eat,
and seconds on all food items"
Anderson said. He continued,
“Our main purpose in being
here is to satisfy students on
campus."

Determine Student Likes

Fisher described student-food
management relationships as “a
sort or human thing." The food
service director and manager
circulate in the dining halls
frequently, ”even to serving
behind the cafeteria line," in
attempts to know the students
and determine their likes and
dislikes. Also, polls are taken
and ”dining hall committees"
are set. up.

Saga menus are made up in
their main office at Oberlin,

standing of the basic principles
underlying the American sys-
tem and an examination of
those principles in the light of
the current and future prob
lems which we face.

”I personally believe that
the American system is suffi—
ciently dynamic to adapt it-
self to the successful solu-
tion of all those problems and
to meet the challenge of both
international competition and
cooperation . . . I believe our
iirm has an obligation toward
helping the American people
make the right decisions in
this critical time."

The bulk of the foundation’s
expenditures have been for “re—
search on economic and finan-
cial questions which have a
bearin on important issues of
public policy," according to
firm president Winthrop H.
Smith. in addition, the founda-
tion has sponsored lectures at
the University of Minnesota,
Reed college, and Princeton,
Duke, Northwestern, and West—
ern Reserve universities. The
lectures at Grinnell are to be
the last sponsored by the foun-
dation.

ginning at Hobart college, Gen-
eva, N.Y. The college foods do-
partment had failed because of
bankruptcy. T h r e e seniors,
“Hunk” Anderson among them,
thought they could operate the
dining rooms efficiently, pleas-
ing the students, and even make
a profit. They proved thenr
selves correct, and upon grad.
uation added William Smith
college across the street, to their
fold.

That was in 1948. Since then
Saga has grown until now 24
schools across the country are
Saga members. In that time,
Saga has never lost a school
member. .

The new Griunell director and
manager both come from man-
agement positions at other Saga
units.

Fisher, 31, appointed direc»
tor of foods, comes from 01)-
erlin college, Oberlin, ohio,
where he has been Saga man-
ager of the food service in
four dining halls serving 700
students since last August. He
previously held administrative
positions at the American
Greeting corp. in Cleveland
and the Oberlin Finishing co,
He also belonged to several
civic groups in Oberlin. He is
married and has three chil-
dren.

Eisele, 2'], who holds a 1956
BS, from Oklahoma A. and M.
