By Andy Bi ingsley

One of the questions which is
always uppermost in the minds
“and oltcn the critical Iauguagei
oi students is what does the}
student council do? This ques-
”lion is often embarrassing to
council members and sympathi

however, need not crawl into
its shell when asked to account

"Both expressed a willingness
to do everything possible to
work out some kind ol,5un-
day evening meal," and I still ,
have hopes, though slight, i
that some solution to the prob- ,

Student Council president puts it
this way, "On looking back over,
the past year, I was at fil‘st‘
discouraged with the fact that.
the student council under my!
leadership did not accomplish .

had deemed so important a

progressed, it was made clear to, .

proposed and which were more I; .
at inable and in some instances
more far reaching. These have
become part oi
