Think/ish translation: The appropriate
word for this gent is Crassanovtz/ Main
reasons: 1. He’s the only guy live know
who sends mimeographed love letters. 2.

He’s the only guy who doesn’t-maké
advances when he runs out of gas (the

gal’s too busy pushing his car). Too-
thoughtless to buy his own cigarettes,

this bird only dates girls who appreciate

the honest taste of ﬁne tobacco. “We

always have something in common," he I
says. “Her Luckies!”
