dramatic and vocally brilliant
interpretation by lrene Jordan.
Miss Jordan. who triumphed,
has a voice or exceptional range.
She took the highest tones and
the lowest with equal firmness
and confidence."

was lrene Jordan. She has a
voice of extraordinary beauty
and richness. She is certainly
one of our finest singers and
she bears close watching."
