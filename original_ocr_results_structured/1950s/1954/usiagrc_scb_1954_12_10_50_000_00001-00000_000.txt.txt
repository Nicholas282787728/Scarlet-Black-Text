Annual Dinner
In Cowles Hall

Trumpet fanfal‘es will open
the annual Boar's Head din-
ner, Sunday at 6:30 pm. in
Cowles dining room. The tra-
ditional old-style English
feast is one of the highlights
of the college Christmas sea-
son.

The men enter the dining
room first. A second fanfare
will announce the entrance of
the faculty guests. The honored
guests, Acting president Rupert
A. Hawk; Acting Dean of the
College, Homer Norton; Dean
of Men Henry A. Brown; rred
Maytag ll, trustee; and Neal W.
Klausner (philosophy), will en-
ter on the third blare of the
trumpets.

After the Oxfordshire St.
George and the Dragon play is

sented or St George by Presi-

The final trumpet fanfare
will herald the entry of the

head. In their procession around
the dining room, they will be
accompanied by the Men’s Glee
club singing the “Boar's Head
Carol”. '

Members of the C of HP will

the unity of Grinnell.

After the Latin grace, spon
taneous toasting. and dinner,
the glee club will conclude the
program with "God Rest Ye
Merry Gentlemen",

The Boar's Head tradition
dates back to the twelfth cen-
tury at Queen’s college in Ox—
ford, England Two legends at
tempt to explain the beginnings
of the custom. One is the an»
cient Norse rite of sacrificing
a boar to their god of peace
and plenty. F‘reyer, who rode
his boar on religious missions.

The other tells of an Engr
lish student who killed a boar
while walking through a forest.
The boar attacked him and he
thrust his Aristotle notes down
its throat, thinking Aristotle
enough to choke any boar. The
celebration that followed be-
came an annual event, in the
form of a Boar's Head dinner.

This is an event that is still
going strong at Queens college
and one that has much tradi-
tion at Grinnell. Bub Holmes,
north campus social chairman,
will be in charge of this year‘s
celebration. Miss Evelyn Boyd
(English), in charge of the St,
George play from year to year,
will be the only female guest.

C of HP Comhleles
Car Rule Revision,
Enables Judgement

In their meeting last Week,
the c of HP completed their
revision of the car rule. The
rule formerly stated.

1) All initial Violations of the
car rule will result in a two
week suspension;

2) Any succeeding violation
will result in a longer suspen-
sion.

In the revision the word
”will” becomes ”may". This En-
ables the C of HP to rely more
upon their judgment in cases
where all conditions and Circum-
stances must be taken into con-
sideration. They are no longer
rigidly bound to recommend
suspensions in all cases.

in other changes, owners of
registered Cars are no longer
obligated to park their vehicles
on the north side of MacEaCh-
ron road but must park it at a
place designated by the C of
HP, Furthermore any requests
for special pcrmlssion must
now be made in writing to the
c of HP. Herctoforc requests
could be made orally to the C
of HP.

The C of HP further ane

Student Council president announced

The League Board president
may he elected two weeks ear-
lier than last year, but plans
are still indefinite, Dottie Ful-
ton, League Board president,
stated Wednesday.

Saturday, Feb. 12 will be
the date of the Student Coun-
cil nominating convention in
Darby gym, and the runoff
election will be Mammy, Feb.
14. Last year the convention
was on March 13 and the elec-
tion on the 15th.

Election of the C of HP presi-
dent will take place on Wed-
nesday, Feb. 23. He was elected
on March 17 last year. Men’s
hall presidents and officers will
be elected after spring vacation}
as they have been in the past,

The training period that will
result from the earlier Student
Council and C of HP elections
was originally suggested by
Dave Ferguson, C of HP presi-
dent.

ue declared, “The primary
motive is to provide some
sense of continuity. We want
to work it out so that the
new man won‘t go in cold. He
should know how We handle
cases and policy—things we
haven‘t got written down. Last
spring all of us started from
scratch."

Kitten also indicated the need
for the orientation system. She
stated, “In the past Student
Council presidents have been
pretty busy in their last se-
mester and since there was no
training program, their re-
placements often didn't ‘get a
chance to find out much about
the lab.”

“If you haven't hurl a chance
to sit in on the various com-
mittees or get acquainted with

certain persons," Kitten de-
clared, "the job can really
throw you for a loop."

League Board, which already
has a training program, works
under a different system than
C of HP and Student Council.
Dottie disclosed. “The new Lea~
gue Board president and mem-
bers really don’t take over un-
til the following year,” she
stated. “Furthermore they aren't
usually living in the halls to
which they are assigned.

"1 like the idea of having the
League Board elections a mu—
ple of weeks earlier," Dottie
commented, "but the 01d and
new League Boards meet num-
erous times to acquaint the new
memb'ers with their jobs, so an
earlier election is not really
necessary."
