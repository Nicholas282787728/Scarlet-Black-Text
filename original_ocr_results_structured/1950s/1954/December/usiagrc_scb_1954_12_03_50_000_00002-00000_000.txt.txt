A Solution To The Slump

The mid-semester slump

is not a cliche but a psycho

1 «Veal and physiological fact. It is marked by apathy, ill
lit lth, and an “I don’t give a damn for the whole state of
Iowa and Grinnell in particular attitude." Some of us are
over the crucial stage now, thanks to a quick trip home;
but a.lot more of us will keep on slumping until Christmas.
’Ihe obvious remedy, and one acknowledged by almost every
member of the college community, is a long weekend.

Though Thanks

‘ving is past, now is the time we can

do. something about a vacation l'or next year. The faculty
will decide the academic calendar for the coming year be-

fore the end of the semester.

Dean Norton has stated that

each year the question of a Thanksgiving vacation is dealt

With, and that “there are a

We would suggest the following variety: A Wednes-
day noon to Sunday night vacation sometime in November,
preferably over Thanksgiving, and triple cuts for the first
class meetings preceding and following the vacation to pre-

vent the long weekend from

Tourniquel

by Peter Moore and

Tile rrir s-
Friday indicated that main-
students understand little or not
at all the importance of science
in a liberal arts cducatioii Why
does this situation exist?
Perhaps the student sees [it
do integration or the de la
iiicnt on our campus, He la - to
see how the science and philos-
ophy divisions are lelated, or
doesn't grasp the element com.
mon to both the science and
hlSlorv departments. it seems to
us that a liberal arts institution
should demonstrate a close rcla
tionship among the moss or
study which make up its cui»
riculum,

Wc bclicre Grinnell has
failed to do this. There is l -
tic e1loi-t made to achicve hare
muny between the various di—
visions. Too ireqiicaitly stude
eiits see iaciilty discussﬁins
hreak down into petty dis
putcs which appear to lie mos
tivated by departmental jeal-
ousies.

There is no valuc lor the
student in listening to this bick—
crlng What is needed is con.
structive argument which re-
sults in better understanding of
the discussion question by both
student and prolcssor.

It then appears that the “Mir
ure oi the Grinncll studcnt to

discord between departmental
members For instance, how can
the student majoring in English

Thus the difficulty in . arise

the problem could also lie in
