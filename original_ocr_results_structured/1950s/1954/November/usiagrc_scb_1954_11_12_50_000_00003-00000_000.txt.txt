not only with the color and
farm and texture of the thing he
is trying to Say, but with the
conquest of this most exaspere
ating but rewarding medium,

Cases in point are Maurice
Logan‘s brooding ltalny Day and
Richard Yip’s finely controlled
Bridge Forms, both executed on
wet paper, in this week’s group
at the Quad; and Phil Dike’s
Lute Afternoon Fog and Noel
Quinn’s gorgeous Freeway Mos<
Ila from last week’s,

All of them look so easy, so
inevitable, so disarming -— this
case and seeming spontaneity,
this economy of means and ef-
fort, are like the singing of Mare
inn Anderson or the perform~
ance at a supremely skilltul
surgeon in the operating room.

Color, the chief plastic instru-
ment of the painter, is played

artists from the west coast.
Sometimes it is deliberately and
expresrively blatant, as in Keith
Crown’s gaudy amusement pier
and Dan Lutz’ gay Sailboats and
the Big Pavilion; sometimes

Brown‘s The Aqueduct, Moxi‘c?

tricia Morris’ sensitive Desert
Mounds and Paul Lingren’s del-
icates Salt Air).

it runs from the deep, rich,
almost stained glass tones oi
Barse Miller's Mill Pond (that
one that was up last week, with
the distracting frayed burlap
mat), through the crisp, clean
greens and blues in George
Post’s White House, Los Gatos
and Jane Gale’s sparkling little
Home Town, to the muted and
carefully poised hues in Wile
‘liam Mahaney’s rather enig-
matic Six' Houso‘s tin—d th-e-b—‘eau-r
tiful weld—like abstraction by
Frances Hughes, entitled Ter-
restrial Forms, which was in
the lighted case last week and
will be on display again.

Slill Needs $210
After ‘Don Juan'

The Lake Acre project is still
3210 short of its $1000 goal, Irv
Simone (physical education) said
Wednesday. 5110 was cleared at

the building is readyiall we
need is the necessary money to
complete the outright purchase
of the land."
