Really Worked

By Don Murphy

“This is the first year that
the Student Council, the League
Board, and the Council of
House Presidents have worked
together to any degree,” Charles
Harpole, C. of H. P. president,
stated in a recent interview on
the activities of the Council of
House Presidents .during the
last semester.

“We have tried to integrate
the students, buildings and
grounds, and the foods depart»
ment in the past semester,”
Harpole continued “As a re-
sult of our efforts, Miss Glea-
son (Foods) visited the men's
halls where the men could ask
questions and talk things over.”

Integration Difficult

The difficulty in the integra
tion of the student governing
bodies of Grinnell was brought
out in the interview. They must
cooperate, but still respect their
individual jurisdiction a nd
powers.

“The Student Council should
have no governing power in
regards to personal discipline
because the Student Council
cannot jeopardize itself by disci»
plinary action," Harpole stated,
“The Council is responsible for
promotion of overall campus
welfare and needs the good will
of students to act most effective
elyf’

of being thought of as a police
man, but admits that the main
job of the Council of House
Presidents and the League
Board is to keep things rune
ning smoothly in the halls une
der their jurisdictions.

The relation of the two came
pus governing bodies to the
Student Council is as the one
forcement to the legislative part
of the government. The Stu
dent Council also handles prob-
lems which cannot be handled
by the League Board or Coun-
cil of House Presidents because
these problems affect the whole
campus. .

“The three groups should get
together and relegate problems
to the correct organization no
matter where they are brought
up,” Harpole said.

This dance is one of a series
of activities sponsored by the
Student Council
taken place, and will take place
in the near future, at the Union.
The idea is to center campus
social life more around the
Union than it has been in the
past.

Some of the other activities
which are tentatively planned
are group singing and hall and
cottage get—togethers. Phil
Brown, chairman of the Union
committee and Student Council
social chairman, hopes that the
students will take advantage of
these opportunities.

“This first semester of 19497

so had the smoothest beginning

and has continued to be the most pleasant semester that I have
experienced since coming to Grinneil,” affirmed President Sain—

uel N. Stevens.

One of the reasons for his opinion, Dr. Stevens stated, is that
student government has been more mature, more articulate, and
more effective than at any time in the past ten years.

Management
Other reasons for the success

Has Maturetl
of the first semester are that the

basic management structure of the College has matured and that
the faculty has become fairly stabilized. Both personnel and pro-
cedures are adequate to meet the requirements of and operation

lof this size, he said. Replacements and additions which were made

to the faculty have been of a very high order. and the men who
have been brought to the campus are proving to be effective as

accept the fact that their leaders

must meet face to face the various problems that are always arise

ing.

. High Hopes For Conference
Dr. Stevens believes that the student government conference
in September gave student leaders an opportunity to see their own
particular problems in relation to the total problems of the insti-

tution.

or the first time it seemed to me that both students and

admi istration had crossed the bridge and were on the same side,”
he continued. “We were thinking together about the well being of
Grinnell college and were not restrained in our discussion by a
feeling of competition or hostility or a lack of confidence in one

another."

The results of the conference speak for themselves. There
have been very few breakdowns in the well planned and well ad-
ministered program of student activity. A growth in student sate
isfaction and morale has been the result of the closer coordination
between administration, faculty, and student government.

Agreement 0n Educational Aims

Student government and the administration are fundamental-
ly agreed as to the type of educational outcome which should be
expected, Dr. Stevens pointed out.

“Our basic ideals are the same. Students, faculty, and admin~
istrative officers are working with a common enterprise in at-

‘tempting to find solutions to common problems."

it is Dr. Stevens' belief that the second student government
conference to be held in Newton this weekend will enable stu-
dents, faculty, and administration to make a critical evaluation
of both the successes and failures of the first semester.

“The conference should enable us to project into the semester
ahead a program and procedure for its realization that should be

even better ‘and more successful
he said.

than that of the first semester,"

This week, with the Closing of the first semestenof the 49750
year, the S 8L 3 dispatched a horde of reporters to interview Cam-
pus bigwigs, both administration and student. The results of these

interviews are to be found on this page and elsewhere.

our pur-

pose has been to gather a well represented round up of opinion on
the general subject of the semester passed.

Grinnell Si'udeni's
'Should Parlicipal‘e
More'. Says Wolfe

By Nancy Nichols

“Participate in outside activi—
ties, mix, meet‘as many differs
ent people as you can," is
League Board president Nancy
Wolf’s advice to underclassmen.
“It’s not till you’re a senior
that you realize how many
things you haven‘t had time to
do, how many people you still
would like to meet.“

Looking back on the past
year, Nancy says, “Cosopera-
tion between student groups
this year has been fine. The
semester has been a very stimu—
lating one. I won’t be happy to
leave Grinnell this spring."

However, she does have a few
criticisms about some phases of
Crinnell life, “On a campus this
size people should know each
other better than they do," she
says. “There is not enough in»
formal mixing of fellows and
girls. Students don't take advan—
tage of opportunities to meet
the faculty as they should. A1-
so there is a deplorable lack of
social courtesy, especially to
guests and dance chaperones.”

“We are going to have more
foreign students here this Sé~
mester,” Nancy adds. “We
should all make a continuous
effort to include them, make
them a part of Grinnell."

In conclusion Nancy says,

“Everyone here should take ad»
vantage of the many opportuni»
ties offered. it is worthwhile
to work hard. You get as much
out of an activity as you put
into it. I wish freshmen could
feel the ‘senior urgency’ to get
the most out of school."

During the first semester,
Mortar Board, with the help of
last year’s Tassels, inventoried
and organized the Lewis and

ordered new magazines and
books for the libraries.
[The tutoring system,
by Mortar Bo'ard and Friars, is
an inovation which should prove
helpful to students who get bee

Thc honor system and service
projects for the school have been

Council Prexy
Calls Semesl‘er
l‘luge Success

By Don Gregg

COOPERATION. spelled in big
letters, is how Earl Peisner terms
the success the student council
has had the past semester,

“1 can‘t recall any other time
that the council, the Council of
House Presidents, and the Lea-
gue Board have worked so well
together.“ he stated.

This cooperation, Peisner said,
has enabled the council to meet
many problems and to overcome
various difficulties.

The past semester has seen
the council set the stage for
free campus movies. utilize the
Union to greater advantage, and
promote more student social 30s
tivities.

Sunday Evening Diinner

“Right now we’re working on
this Sunday evening meal pro—
ject.” Peisner said. “We feel that
the students are entitled to a
meal because of the expense and
difficulty of eating out on Suns
day night.”

While the administration does
not fully approve the project,
they have cooperated with the
council in seeing what can be
worked out. The success of the
project depends a lot on the
forthcoming financial statement.

“Along these lines we‘ve en—
countered the problem of how
far the council’s function ex-
tends."

Should the Council, when it
sees something that needs doing,
act itself or suggest to some
other appropriate agency the
action needed?

Diversity of Opinion

“There is a diversity of opin—
ion among the council members
about this,” Peisner went on.
”Some feel that the Council
should stick to suggestions while
others believe they should take
definite action.”

He cites as an example a re.
cent basketball night. No after»
game activity had been sched»
tiled.

“We didn’t know whether it
was our place to plan an activie
ty or to suggest the idea to
someone else."

Peisner hopes to approach a
solution to this problem when
he meets with the student lead—
ers conference next week.

“At the present we’re work
ing with other schools in the
conference on a project that
should promote better relations
in the conference and serve as
an agency for exchanging ideas."
Council to Chicago

Council rcprescnttatives will
attend a meeting in Chicago in
February with all other schools
of the Midwest conference.

“We’ll discuss our mutual
problems and see what steps
can be taken to solve them,” he
said.

“We feel there is a lot more
the student council can do in
actively serving the school and
we hope.the cooperation we’ve
achieved between the student
governing groups and the ad—
ministration is the initial step
in that direction,” Peisner con—
cluded.

Psych Prof. Writes Article

Mr. Charles Haner (psychol—
ogy) and Mr. Wilse B. Webb of
Washington University have
published an article "Education-
al and Psychological Measures
ment" (vol. nine, no. 4).

The article, “Quantification of
the WechslereBellvue Vocabu-
lary Sub-Test”, is a progress re.
port on the research Mr. Haner
