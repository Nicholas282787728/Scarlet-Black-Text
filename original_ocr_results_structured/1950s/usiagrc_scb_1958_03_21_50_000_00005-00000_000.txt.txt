Dateline . . . New York city
(the heart of), Columbia Univ,

Because I’ll more than likely
return to Grinnell next fall I’d
not want to recede into utter
oblivion — therefore this note,
with all of New York in it (be-
cause I do feel the”! I’ve become
somewhat assimilated) except
for the accent, or course, which
I’ll leave to Botvinick and Katz
and the rest of you who have
sacrificed all the East‘s excite-
ment for the quietude of Grin-
nell (if, in reality there be such
a place. Now that I’m here I
sometimes have to concentrate
deeply to remember anywhere
else. Everything is so different,
so new and tremendously excit-
ing).

Well, needless to say, I'm
presently situated in the midst
of the Ivy Leaguehor, not
really Lhe “midst"; Columbia
finished last in baskeilball, as
she has in pretty much every-
thing else this season (this is
an 4‘. . . academic rather than
an athletic surrounding"). May
be, then, sportly speaking, i
should say “situated on the end
of the Ivy League.” But, it is
the Ivy League, I know for
sure because I‘m reminded of
the fact many times a day. To
be sure, they're proud of them-
selves out here.

i let my studies sit one eve-
ning, so that i might watch
a YaleaColumbia basketball
game, one of the few college
sports events I’ve seen since
1 left the Pioneers struggling
for a first division berth in
MWC play. And, oi course, I
had to sit in the bleachers as
cvoryono else. It was quiet,
however, so I was able to
concentrate easily.a lot more
quiet than is Darby on a Sat»
urday night, or even a Tues-
day ior that matter. I was
surprised, certainly, and much
pleased, to witness a gather-
ing so apathetic as to make
a Grinnell sports event appcnr
——l~a.i.hcr than void in spirit
as I've often suggested—as a
truly gratifying experience.
To say that Yale won )5 un-
necessary, and the score has
even slipped my mind. 1 might
prophesy, however, that were
the Bulldogs (Yale) and Grin»
nell to contest the former, un-
der normal conditions complete-
ly disregarding the “anything
can happen" philosophy, would
win by, say, 10 points. Obvious-
ly, though, there’s much to roe
considered, namely size and
scholarships and the emphasis

placed on sports, which makesE

a comparison virtually mean-
ingless. Yet, I was interested
and thought you might be.
Now, Yale is considered the
Ivy’s best. i feel certain that
Pfitsch could throw together
any five starters and walk
away from Columbia, Cornell,
and Brown (the teams I‘ve
seen play), 1 don't know how
things concluded in the Mid-
west, but when i left, Kantz-
ler, Mchmsey (Bob), and Cope—
land were hitting pretty well.

Revenge The Motive As Nelmen
Get Ready For Coming Semi

With the approach of spring
in the air, the interest in len—
nis among this year's varsity
candidates is rapidly building
up. With five of last year’s var-
sity lettermen returning this
season, the team is out to av;
enge the losing ﬁght the team
had for the Conference title
with Lawrence last year.

After parading through the
regular season without a com
lerence loss, last year's team
met the boys iron. Lawrence
for the first time in the con-
ierencc meet, and ended up
three points behind them in
the final tabulation,

Returning this year are Dick
Katz, Jim Hautzinger, Bill
Hahn, Dave Leavenworth and
Larry Laucr. Katz, Hautzingcr
and Hahn fought it out for the
top three positions on the team
last year, but generally played
one, two and three man respecs
tively. Leavenworth and Lauer
fought it out for the fifth spot
on the team throughout the sca-
son. and played alternately in
that position.

The only man lost from last
year's strong team is Larry Coc,
who played at the number four
position. Added on to this year‘s
team arc two sophomores, Bill
McClung and Dave Kelsen, who
played in the number two and
three positions on last year's
frosh team.

since it is very difficult to
determine how strong the oths
or teams will be so early in thc

season, it is hard to say how
Grinnell will come out in the
conference race. With the ﬁve
returning lettermel-l and the ad-
dition of McClung and Kelscn,
the squad has considerable
depth. Very likely the center-
ence title race will be a strug-
gle between the Pioneers and
Lawrence, with Knox and Carla.
ton pushing them with only an
outside chance at the title,

Lawrence. conference win-
ners irom last year are weak—
ened this year by the gradua-
tion of several of their best
tennis players, The title race
will probably be determined
to a great extent by the abil-
ity of Lawrence to ﬁll thesc
slots vacated after graduation
with players from the fresh—
man squad. in a game such as
tennis, which is played by in-
dividuals alone and not so
much as a team, a school can
oltcn bolster its team with
the mere addition of one or
two outstanding new players
to ﬁll in the weak slots liow
successful Lawrence will be
at this cannot be determined
as yet,

All in all, it looks like a
bright season ahead for the
Pioneer netman under Coach
lrv Simone. The team moves in»
to conference competition a
week after spring vacation with
a dual meet against Knox on
April 12 here on our home

courts.

This Saturday the Pioneers
travel to Northdeld to lace
Carleton in a dual meet. All
prospects point to a close
meet. This will conclude the
indoor track scoson for the
Pioneers.

Although the squad is inex-
perienced, it has been responda
ing very well throughout the
season, according to Coach E. G.
Booth. Booth also commented
that Carleton is likewise handle
capped by lack of experience,
which should keep things close.
