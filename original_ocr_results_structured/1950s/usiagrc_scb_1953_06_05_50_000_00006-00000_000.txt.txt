Grinncll's play season ofﬁcially opened this year with the

Homecoming play,

The spring play, “Rope.” die
rooted by Nancy Weinield and
John Springer, under the su-,
pcrvisioh of Kent Andrews, was
presenmd in, the Arena theatre
this April.

The opera workshop, under'
Kim Chase and Duane Crossley,
presented Menottis two act
opera, “The Old Maid wand the
Thief," February 5 and 6, and
Sigmund Roinbcrgs musical
comedy, “The Desert Song,”
April 10. _

On October 23 and 25, Wii»
iiain ingram, under the spon—
sorship of the Manuscript club,
presented his honors project, an
Arena production of “Agamem-
non," the first play of_a trilogy
iby Aeschylus.

Norman Cohen directed the
Friars play _”Aridromadu‘e,"

On April 29 the Grinnell
Players presented '“Pursuiteof
Happiness," directed by Roger
Perry, Tom Read, and Nancy'
thCemcr, under the supervision
of Kent Andrews.

I nominate “Andromque,”
“W and “Pulsuit or Hap-
piness" as the outstanding
plays oi this year.

play. hacines story of the tragic
-love or the Greek hero Phyrrus
star the Trojan captive A’ndro-
‘maque was well cast, ~well di—
rected, and well presented.

James Stewart's portrayal of
Orcstes was outstanding. His
characterization had a depth
and honesty; sparing neither
faults nor virtues, which made
Crestes a living person Nancy
weinields interpretation oi
.Hermione was excellent Elea-
nor Park did a good job with
the difficult rble of Andro
maque. ,

The weak point oi the play
was Phyn'us. James Leaven~
worth's : characterization seemed
an attempt to violate the~classic
conception of tiagedy, the rail
of a man of high estate through
some tault of his o,wn which
was contradicted by the dialogue
and the action in surl‘l a way
that- Phyiius lacked reality.

One of the outstanding tea-i
'tures of “Rope" was its set

The inn grillwork'_ which out-
lined a room where the ac.
tion took place gave the play
a sense of completeness which
'is not often found on the’
Arena stage.

This melodrama about a
"thrill” murder iound such ia-
vorablc audience reaction that
it had to run an extra night. .

Roger Perry's Chuck. Weak—
ncrved accomplice in the more
der, was convincing and consis-
tent. Rupert, the graduate 'stue
dent who discovered the crime,
was wellepla'ycd by John
Springer. James Leavenworth:
portrayal of Brandon, master-
mind of the murder, was ade-
quate, but somewhat e atic. '

Evi Grottcwit deserves honbre
able mention tor her excellent
job oi characterizing Mrs. John-
_stoue, the murdered boy‘s aunt,

accent was consistently well
done and easily understood .

Although the play was. on the
whole. well done, some oi the
players did, at times, step out
of character; but Doug was his

“Both Your Houses," Maxwell
Anderson's poiitical iarce. holds
an undisputed position as the
poorest of the year's produc—
tions’, The set was good, and the
actors worked hard, but it
seemed a shame to waste so

being a complete flop. Nancy
Weinfeld's overplaying, or the

ridiculous heights, but her an.
tics did 'give a few bursts at

The onceact plays were well-
'(lirected and adequately acted,
but nothing more.

“Agalnelnnon” was an interest.

ing was poor and distracted

when the pantomime did not
tend toward overeexuberance.

For the lirst,time, Grinnell
has included an opera and a
musical comedy among ‘its drae
matic presentations. The results
of the collaboration or the
music and drama departments
were two' productions, "enter-
taining in spite oi a lack.or true
