Pioneers Rout Redmen, Scotsx

’ Knox

The vacation over, the Pie
neers got down to serious husi
ness, dusting off on successive
outings, Ripon 58 42 and Mon-
mouth 75 53. The victoiies mark
ed Grinnell’s second and thiid
conference tiiuinphs.

Before Ripon faded, however,e
they gave the Pioneers quite a
scare, entirely outplaying Grin—
nell in the first half. The Red-
men left the floor at half time
with a six point 28722 advantage.
Grinneli‘s rebounding and Shoots
ing improved tremendously in
the second half, and this coupled
with Ripons sharp tailspin in
shooting from 35.1% to 172%
accounted for the Pioneers large
margin of victory.

Again it was Dunlop's 24
points and Bigelows 13 that
paced the Scarlet and Black

Grinnell will face in the confer-

completely louted their shorter
opponents, so much so that
Pfitsch was able to strip the
bench in the second half, giving
everyone a chance to play. The
final score Grinnell 75, Mon-
mouth 58.

Grinnell’s fr'ee throw percentv

‘ago, the Maize has an excellent
chance of taking the conference.
l This year the scarlet and
Black tankers will have to play
the "dark horse" role. For, with
so many new and inexperienced
men on the squad, no one, not
even the Pioneers themselves,
know what they can do. With a
little more seasoning and a few
breaks Knopﬁ’s boys Could well
be a title threat.

Representing Grinnell at Car-l
leton today will be freestylers
Gerry Allen, Jack Edgren, Har-
vey Nixon, Bob Risse,Jlm Stock-
er, and Bob Zeitler; backstroke
ers Dick Friedman, Wiley Mc—
Connell, and Bali Risse; breast»
strokers Earl Fisher and Jack
