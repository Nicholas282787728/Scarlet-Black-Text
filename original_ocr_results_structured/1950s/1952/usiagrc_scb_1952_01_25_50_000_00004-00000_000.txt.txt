Grapplers Wrestle
Wi’rh Cornell Rams;
Defeai Carls 24-l0

Facing one of their toughest
tests of the season, Coach Hank
Brown's matinen took on 212*
fending contsrencc champion,
Cornell, in a dual meet this
afternoon 'at Mt. Vernon,

So far this year, the Rams
have won two dual meets,
swamping helpless Augustana
3vo and trouncing a strong
Kansas state squad. Their only
black mark is an 1340 loss to
power-tut Purdue, potential
Big Ten champ.

Right now the man to watch
among the Cornell grunt and
groaners is 167-pounder Warren
Sonneman. who with two clear
cut victories appears to he the
most_polished wrestler on the
team.

However, an up and coming
young grappler is Mark Murray

, who set an unofficial record of
31.5 seconds for the quickest tall
in a Cornell dual meet, wiping
out former Olympic wrestler
Dale Brand's old mark of 32
seconds.

Cornell's starting lineup is
Ted Bredehaft or Mark Mur-
ray, 123 pounds; Bali Roman-
owski, 130 pounds; Bob Nelson
or Warren De Prenger, 137
pounds; Jim Miller, 147 pounds;
Ray Johnson, 157 pounds;
Warren Sonneman, 167 pounds;
Bob Funston or Don Linden,
117 pounds, and Dick Wade,
heavyweight.

,In 'last Saturday's romp,
Brown’s boys chalked up their
first win of the season as they
slaughtered .an impotent Carleton
crew, 24-10. Led by Captain
Bernie Cakes, the Pioneers rack-
ed up two pins, three decisions,
and a forfeit to swamp Carleton.
Also outstanding for the Scar-
let and Black was George Tole
bert, 137~pound freshman who
decisioned Jerry Trent, 2.1, to
win his second straight bout.
Results of the meet were:

Carleton Hands

Grinnell Cagers
75-52 Trouncing

Grinnell’s Pioneers dropped
their fourth conference game in
five starts to leading Carleton
at Northficld, Minn, Saturday,
75752

Carleton romped off to a 21
10 lead early in the Contest and
the Scarlets were never in con-
tention. Grinnell was facing one
of the best teams they will
meet all year and just couldn't
match the Classy Cal‘ls.

Grinnell fell behind 2278 in
the first quarter but matched
the Knights in_ the second
stanza to keep the margin
38—25 at hamime. '

After the intermission Grin-
nell still held its own and was
behind 6145 going into the
final canto. At this point Carl?
ton caught fire again and rolled
on to the final score.

Grinnell’s defense was good
but couldn’t stop the fastbreak-
ing single post oftense employed
by the Knights. Dave Stum»

haugh turned in an especially
fine job of holding Addington,
thc Carl’s high scoring forward,
to in points. This is the same

eager that earlier in the week
had racked up an amazing 42
pomts against St. Olaf, the new
Midwest conference member.
Coach John Pfitsch also liked
the play of guards Don Hager
and Hartley Bond.

Pfitscll rates the Knights as
the hest team in the Midwest
conference since the Belait
powerhouse oi two years ago.
He said the earls had too
much speed and heigh} for the
young Pioneers,

So far Carleton has lost only
two games this season, both to
Hamline who has conquered
Drake university by 20 points
in both their meetings.
