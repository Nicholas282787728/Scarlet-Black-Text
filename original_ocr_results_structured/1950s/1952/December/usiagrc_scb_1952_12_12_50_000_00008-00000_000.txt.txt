Brown Plans
Campus Work

lnves‘l'igallon

Dcan cl Men Henry' A. Brown
said Wednesday that he Is Ie-
lVIewmg the student employment
lsituation on campus in an eitoIt
ltd see that those students need-
ling work most badly have jobs.

He added that there are sev.»
l erztl things which need to he
corrected as long as there are
more people needing ani‘lwzuitn
I in; work than there are jobs.

in all prohahility, a student
will-not be able to lIve off cam—
pus and work on campus next
semester. Dean Brown said that
the reason tor this is that the
men living In the dorms are
paying more than those living
off campus, and In many cases
{cannot get a job on campus. .

Also, students will be rc—
quired to maintain a 72 aver
age III order to keep a job.

Dean Brown wants to remind
all men students who haven’t
had their chest ways that the
lmobile unit will be downtown
the evening of Dec. 17, and that
the college health committee has
asked everyone In the college to
take part In the pIogram.

A responsible consulting organization reports a study by a
competent medical specialist and staff on the effects of smoking
ClIesterfleldsI For six months a group of men and woman

smoked only Chesterfield—10 to 40 a day—their normal amount.
45 percent of the group have smoked Chesterfields from one to
thirty years for an average of ten years each.

At the beginning and end of the six-months, eacli smoker was
given a thorough examination including X- rays) and covering
the sinuses, nose. eats and throat. Aftel these examinations,
the medical specialist stated . . .

“It is my opinion that the ears, nose, throat and attes-
sory organs of all participating subjects examined by me
were not adversely uffecied' In the six-months period by
smokIng the cigarettes provided. “
