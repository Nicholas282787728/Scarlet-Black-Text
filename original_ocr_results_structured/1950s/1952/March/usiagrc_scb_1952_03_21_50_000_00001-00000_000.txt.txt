In the Student Council meet:
ing last night: discussion con-
sisted largely of reports by the
election and pep committees. I

The election committee recomr
mended several procedures for
improving the Student Council
election next year. The com-,
mittee asked for suggcstionsl
from- council members regarding
the action of the board members
this year in calling up each floor
of the halls to tell students to
vote if they had not yet done so.

The council recommended that
next year’s board members re-
frain from calling. The imparti-
ality of the board members was
discussed. The student council
recommended that members of
the election board should not
campaign actively for a candle

date, although they should be
allowed to vote for hall dele-
gates. l

Sylvia Redding, James senior,‘
reported that the pep committee
had discussed plans for a pep
club. Action on its recommenda-
tions was left for the next
meeting.

The cut system was again dlSV
cussed, and the council approved,
a letter which would be sent tot
the personnel board, suggesting
a rewarding of the regulations
in the college bulletin. .

The rewording would clarify
the regulations regarding the our
system, and would add the fact‘
