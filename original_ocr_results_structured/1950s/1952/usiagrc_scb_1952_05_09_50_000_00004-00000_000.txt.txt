Netmen Travel To Omaha
After Two Close Defeats

the Pioneers were edged at
Carleton 473 Saturday. Despite
the absence or Bob Dibble, the
Plitschmen battled gamely be
fore succumbing to loss numr

Taking nothing away irom
a good Carleton team, the
presence of Dibble would
have meant another Crinnell

triumph, Bob Skrainka ad-
mirably filled the number one
spot by winning both his
singles match, and doubles
along with Bill Hamilton.

On spring day a large crowd
braved a temporary rain and
waited 45 minutes to watch
two of the three best tennis
teams in the state of Iowa
battle for honors. A tine lowa
State team won three of the
four doubles matches to gain a
close 7-5 victory.

Dibble was i'iorced to go all
out as he kept his unbeaten
streak in tact uy downing Dan
McEachran 6-3, 7-5. It was the
best tennis played on the Pio-
neer courts in '52.

Bill Hamilton put on a spirita
ed comeback to thrill the crowd
as he beat Tom Klinefelter 3-6,
6-4, 6-3. Other Scarlet and
Black winners were John
Young and Paul Friend in
singles matches, and Dibble and
Jim Mafﬁt in doubles.

In today’s Omaha match, the
home team was highly favored.
They hold wins over many fine
