One 01 the athletes new to
the Gl‘innell campus thio )cdi'
is tennis star Bill Hamilton,
CDWlCo freshman, ‘

1 Bill, sometimes known as,
i‘Ham" to his f‘ends. hnils

om Hinsdalc, Ill. where he let—
tered in baslrctbull niid tennis.

Bill was captain pl his high
ischool tennis team and led the
,squad to a third in thc stutc
‘ tournament An Outstanding
guard on the basketball team.
Bill helped his mates to the
state tournament bEiOi‘e they

‘were eliminated,

He has already gained a list
of accomplishments at Grin~
nell. He is] a member of the
Hernlils, wrth a 94 grade avel'a
age, a technical sergeant in the
ROTC program, and a numeral
winner in freshman basketball.

‘ Most afternoons Bill can be
found either on the tennis
court or in his room hitting the
books. Keepnig a 94 average
while mmoring in science and
math and participating regularly
iin sports is a full time Job.

An optimistic outlook is taken
by Bill in regard to this year’s
ltennis team. Although he has
not had an opportunity to see
‘any of thc other conferencc
teams in action he thinks Gl‘mr‘l
lnell has some great players. '

At the present time Bill is
playing in the number two
spot behind the already estab-
lished star, Bob Dibble. On
speaking of Dibble, Bill stated,
”He's the best guy l've cvcr
played against."

When asked why he had
chosen to attend Gi’innell he
said, "I want to do something,
not be another number in a big
school,” Tennis coach John
Ffitsch is glad Bill felt that way.

Liiting the ircshman rule has
given Bill a chance to get an
early start on the Grinnell
varsity teams. He has already
:shown he is a star, and Grin—
nell fans will be seeing a lot
vef Bill Hamilton for the next
few years.
