Grinneli, Drake‘-
Vie Tomorrow

On Home Links

Grinnell golfers will come up
against Drake university tomor-
row/ at 2 pm. on the local
course; Monday they go to Iowa
State for another meet.

The Pioneer golfers have im-
proved with five qualifying
scores under 79 for the Drake
contest. Qualifiers are John
Hammer, pete Smith. Frank
Smith, Bill Lazier, and Tom
hailsback.

In a meet Friday, April 25,
Grinnen finished in a dismal
ﬁfth place hehind Iowa State.
Loras, Drake. and Iowa Teach—
ers. The meeting was sponsored
by Iowa State and played on
their home course at Ames.

. . I
The course is considered one

of the trickiest in the state with
streams, rivers and woods sure
rounding the area. This is borne
out by the scores most of which
were in the mid 80’s and 505.
Low golfers were Don Flatt and
Dan Molyneax of Iowa State
who carded 73’s for the Iii-hole
match. Smith and Lazier finish-
ed with an 83 and 86 which is
a good score for outsiders.

Compared to ore-season prev
(ﬁctions, the showing of the
golfers lately has been SurpriSr
ingly good.

ters into the home stretch this
