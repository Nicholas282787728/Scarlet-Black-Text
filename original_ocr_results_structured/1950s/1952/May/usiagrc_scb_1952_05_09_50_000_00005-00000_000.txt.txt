hably “lovedble” Lin Stacey, Battle Monday i

high school in Chicago in Febru~ :field will be the key game of the

ary, 1949. He did not participatecampaign, A victory by Gates

in athletics until his senior year
when he lettered in football and
track. Until then he thought he,
was not good enough to make;
a team. He did not try his luck]
until he received encourage»!
ment from his football coach.

After hurting his leg in track .

at neKalb, Lin lost his selfr
confidence and thought he couldl,
never regain any of the form he i
had acquired in high school orl
at the start of his college career.’
Lin owes a lot to Spade Cooley,
who worked with him, built up
his self~confidence, and put a
new desire to win\into him. Until
then his track time had never
improved. ’

ln freshman track at Grinnell,
Lin’s greatest thrill was a dual‘
meet with Simpson in which he‘
beat Jim Klein, a decathlon
man, in the 440»yard run. l

since he has found himselfl
again, he has become a stalwartl
on the track squad. Tomorrow
he faces a severe test when he
runs up against Gordan Busse
of Coe in the 440 dash. Busse
will be about the toughest con-
ference competition Lin has en:‘
countered yet.

Everyone is expecting a lot
of Lin Stacey during the rest
of the season and in the con-
ference meet May 23724.
