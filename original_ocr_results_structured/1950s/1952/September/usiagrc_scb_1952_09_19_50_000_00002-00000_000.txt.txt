.duce the cost of each paddle to
,10 cents.

in addition, the council. meet-
t ing with members of Honor G,
. persuaded that organization to
, greatly lower prices on prep

nicn now will distributc the
beanics at the lowest price in
. recent years, doing it as n

prolit—makmg proposition.

Another major change made

"by thc c of HP is the climi-
ination of studv hall for fresh
'mcn men, held last ycar in Lair
igan basement. Lack at room
caused by the large numbcr of
incoming students forced the
,council to abandon the study
ihall. This year each north cam-
ipus hall will conduct its own
;study.
