Smith Wins Debate, Women T'

 

Here’s the Battle of the Budget

(Ed. note: Because there are
students who feel they have
not had the details necasary to
understand me financial condi-
tion of Grinnell college and the
recent efforts to cut operating
expenses, the 55:3 is publish-
ing the following information
obtained in an interview with
President Samuel N. Stevens.
Figures are given in round
numbers for clarity.)

Because of the increase in
operating costs and a decrease
in enrollment, Grinnell college
ended the 1951—52 school year
with a deficit of $200,000.

in May, the budget for the
105253 school year was chart-
ed, based on an enrollment of
950 students. The proposed
budget amounted to $1,600,000.

When school opened in Sept,

there were 858 students. The
estimated income excluding
gifts, was then $1,,300 000. The-
deficit here, $380,000 plus the

 

Carry over deficit from last
year amounted to $580,000.

President Stevens can nor—
mally expect to raise a maxir
mum of $140,000 in gifts to
cover operating expenses in a
year. The Board of Trustees

wanted to reduce this year’s
budget by $240,000. These two
would have balanced the bud-
get for this year.

A budget cut of this size
could not have been made with
'om reducing some of the edur

cational opportunity and qualr
ity from the present
program.

Rather than cut in this area.
President Stevens has cut this
year’s budget $110,000, without
affecting the educational life of
the college.

Cuts were made in the ad-
ministrative section, including
public relations, admissions, the
presidents office, the summer

(i.e., mimeographmg and cleri-
cal help), infirmary, library,
service bureau, operational ser-
vices inciuding the proposed
housekeeping cut, and auxiliary
services (i.e., bookstore, furni-
ture repairs).

To summarize: This $110,000
reduction, coupled with the ex-
pected gifts of $140,000, still
leaves $130,000 of this year‘s
budget not.covered. This 3130,-
000 plus the $200,000 deficit of
last year total $330,000.

To meet this, $300,000 that
was temporarily used for en—
dowment purposes was put into
the current operations fund.
This paid last year’s deficit and
$100,000 of this year’s deficit.

There is still $30,000 unac.
counted for. To meet this,
President Stevens must raise
$30,000 in gifts, in addition to
the $140,000 already budgeted
las gifts.
