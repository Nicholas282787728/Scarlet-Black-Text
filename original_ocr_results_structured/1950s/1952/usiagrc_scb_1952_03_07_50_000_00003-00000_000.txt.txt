Before the presentations were‘
made, Christian P. Gruiber
(English) spoke brieﬂy on “The
Context of the Key." He intro-
duced his talk with the state-
inent that the meaning of a
word varies with its context.
Therefore, knowing, the context
is necessary to understanding
words and reacting to them.

The context (if the key. which
is the symbol of the' Phi Beta
Kappa organization, he went on
to say, depends upon‘ the wear-
er’s previous experience, ‘Using
his own experience as a basis,
Gruber gave whatihe believes
to he the true meaning of“ the
key. -

The key signifies a link in the
‘chain of high aspiration, a high
record or scholarship attained
by the full use at one‘s natural
talent, and achievement of dis»
criminating and catholic tastes.
