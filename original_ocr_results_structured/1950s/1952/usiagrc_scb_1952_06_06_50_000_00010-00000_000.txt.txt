suppers at various faculty spon-
sors’ homes were numerous.‘

treated the Friars to a wattle
party with Doug Freyder su-
pem rig the’ baking oi the
wnii'les. Friars initiated their ,
new members at a picnic last -
month at 'about the same time l
the senior Mortar .Board went
to Mnrshalltown for ii iinal
dinner together.

Eleanor wilcox, Cleveland, and’
Harvey Nixon. Rawson. will be‘
the new presidents of the or—
ganizations replacing Rosemary
Martin. Read, and Jim Klssane,
Smith, who held the positionsl
this year. . 1
