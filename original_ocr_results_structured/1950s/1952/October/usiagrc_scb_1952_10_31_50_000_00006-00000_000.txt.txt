league and is a heavy favorite
to cop the title at the Confeb

Probably the most iiieinoi-ahic
game betneen the two schools
occuried two years ago. in the
last minute a determined Caric-
tori cicvcn pushed over two
touchdowns for a 21-19 victory.
Thc Knights never gave up, but
playcd ball tor 50 mil minutes.
Some or our alumni remember
that nightmare only too well

Tomorrow aitcrnoon our win-
lcss clcvcn will get a chance to
kill two birds with one stones
it they want to. First, they may
step out at the collar spot.
Second, they can go a long way
towards making up tor their
poor showing so tar. No one
knows better than the tCam
members how they never seem
to play ball for 60 minutes a
game.

Carleton figures.lo be the
favorite. They've won games; the
Pioneers have not. Still, the
Town and Cornell contests last
week showed one thing it a
team wants to win badly enough,
it will. Giim determination and
guts go tait

Anyone who is close lo this
years team knows that it has
the material and that the
coaches have worked hard with
it. The new offense has been
more ' than satistactory, yet
Gi-inncll remains in the cellar
thus tar. Tomorrow's question,as
always with this squad. is the
will to win.
