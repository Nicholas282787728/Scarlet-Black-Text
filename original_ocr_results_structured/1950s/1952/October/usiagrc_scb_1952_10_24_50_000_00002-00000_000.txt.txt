A Step Forward I

There has been some talk this year about the possi»
bility of flooding an area near the campus to use for ice
skating There has even been some action taken in this
direction. Students and administration alike seem to be
in favor of such a move, though as yet nothing definite
has been decided upon. .

We think we can safely say that winter is coming,
and if all ice skating area is going to be made availablel
to the students this year, now is the time to make definite
plans. ‘ , .

Such an addi on to the social setup here may pave thel
way for an entire revamping of our social program. The
program may, and we feel-should, be expanded to include
the nonedancers alld non-card players who pay their social.
fee along with everyone else.

The advent of informal parties in the union and Youn-
ker lounge, along with the enlarged free movie program,
has made a start in what could become a more varied
and more successful program, including activities for every
student on campus. _

, ‘ Shouldn’t We Care?

In his convocation address yesterday, Makota Fujita
spoke on the far-reaching effects of World Student Service
Fund contributions, The money has not only aided ma-
terially by providing books and food and hospital care, but
it has been far more important as an indication of the
spirit of American students who realize the necessity of
intelligent leadership throughout the world.

If we believe that education makes a difference in the
quality of a nation’s leadershipwand Grinnell College does
iwe must be willing to help students in less fortunate
countries. Such aid is not charity, but rather an investment
in our future. We agree with Fujita that the World Stil-
dent Service Fund is indeed “a great thing,"
