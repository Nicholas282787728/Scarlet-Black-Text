Why were the require'merits
liar entering Grinnell changed
this last surnme 7' Just what was
wrong with the old ouai sy5e
ltem7 How does the new system
atiect trs directly? Many Slur
dents in the past ten days have
been asking these questions. The
"changes in some cases are
.sweeping, and represent a now
.departure from original policy.
Accordrng to Mr. George Lov-
tell, director or student motel—
ing, the aim of the new system
is to see that the student ob—
tams a liberal education more
effectively than betore. It is felt
that the program hangs togeth—
er more than the old qual sys-
tem, and that it will end con-
‘Iusiun over what subyects one
could pass by tak rg the quali-
tying exam, or what subiects
‘eould be passed by taking iust
the course. The new program,
through the distribution Tee
qirir-ements system. is designed
also to end the uneven and un-
balanced schedules that some
students had adopted under the
old plan.

The program directs freshman
rn several new ways. Firstly,
there are no more “qualifying"
examinations. A ireshman can
exempt himself from a subject
by high scoring iii the place—
ment exams during new student
days, For all the rest. courses
