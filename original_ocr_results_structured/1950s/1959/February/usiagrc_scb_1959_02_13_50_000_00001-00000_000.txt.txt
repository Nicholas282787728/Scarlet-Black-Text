Corelli Musicians
To ‘Play In Chapel

Tuesday at 8:30 pm. the So»
cieia Corelli, consisting of is
highly distinguished stringed in-
strumentalists, will present an
evening of chamber music in
Herrick chapel.

The musicians who are
making their fourth tour at
this country, will present mu-
sic by the masters at the ba-
roquo cra including Corolla,
Vivaldi, Eocchcrini, and others.
The members of this group
have been chosen by tho Rah
ian government to serve as
ambassadors of good will and
to represent thc Corelli Ter-
centenary with ﬁne music and
musicianship.

The group has taken its nams
as well as its style from the
18th century court violinist, Ar-
rangelo Corelll. The two most
notable contributions or t=-‘s
composer were the prestige he
brought to the violin through his
highly .traiued and skilled per-
fonnances, and the change he
brought about in the musical
style of his time, Until the lath
century, orchestration had been
written for simple voice pal .
Corclli brought out the illdivid»
ual distinctions of each instru-
ment in his concerti and suites.
This contribution has been de-
scribed as giving to Italian mu-
sic a "warm, ﬂowing (style) por~

sessed of a broad, undisturbed
sense of humanity."

in their concert Tuesday the
Societa Corelli will present
’cello soloist Silvano Zuccarini,
who is a veteran oi success-
ful tours in Europe, the United
States, Canada, and Cuba; stu-
dent at world renown Gaspor
Cascade, and ono oi the

osi.

cert world," alter three succes
ful trans—Atlantic tours as well
as performances in Boston, New
York, Minneapolis, and Phila~
delphia, is coming to Grinncll

temporary world,"

editorial mastheads of the Cy-
clonc for the 1959 Cyclone
Queen. The candidates are Pat

didates will be sent to Bob
Cummings, TV actor, and Mere»
dith Willson, Composer of “The
Music Man,” who will choose ‘
the queen. Joe Nassif, editor of
the Cyclone, said, “We thought
it would give more prestige to
the Cyclone to have the queen
selected by Celebrities. it will
also give publicity to the cal»
legal"

This year, as in past years,
the winner will be announced
at the Spring formal, which ac-
cording to Nassif, “is usually
dedicated to the crowning of the
Cyclone Queen."

45 Sl'uclenl's
On Probation

Two sophomore men were dis—
missed from school at semesters
for low scholarship and 45 stu-
dents were placed on academic
probation, according to figures
released by the Dean of the
College’s oince today, Thirty—six
of the students placed on proba-
tion were men and nine were
women. Last year three men
were dismissed from mhooi and
45 students were placed on pm-
bation.

“However, there is one signifr
cant difference in the ﬁgures of
last year as compared with this
year," said Givens 1., Thornton,
registrar. "Since last February,
the minimum grade—point that
a student can receive without
being placed on probation has
been raised for freshmen, sopho-
mores, and juniors." Last year
the minimum grade-point for
freshmen was 1.50; for sopho—
mores, 1.75; and tor juniors,
1.95. This year they are 1.60,
1.80, and zoo, respectively.

Using a 1.60 minimum grade-
point for a standard, Thornton
compared the freshmen of the
last three years. This year there
are 22 ireshmen who received
grade-points of 1.60 or lower.
“Since the over-all number of
students placed on probation has
remained the same, in spite of
the increased standards," Thoma
ton said, “this indicates a gen-
eral improvement in the caliber
oi the student body.”

Last year there were 31 in the
same classiﬁcation, and in 1957,
there were do.
