The Social Skirmish—Part I

Women select

llnquestioning Submission To Rules? Ha” Ofﬁcers

Change Must Come From Students

by Bill MCClIIng (Feature Editor)

It is in the Character of many Gl'innell social regula—
tions that. they operate unquestioned, The result is something

that approaches a cult of the status quo

 

an ullques’tioning

submission to the authority of rules merely because, they
are rules and no one thinks they can be altered,

Isn’t it time that We shake off
this interiority complex and
honestly analyze our way of
lite as students and how utis
life is atfccted, positively or

negatively, by the social regu—

lations in eftect7 To this writer
it appears that some of the
rules to which we must submit
are not based upon an intelli—
gent analysis of the present sit-
uation. Rather, they are likely
little more than sorry. souven~
irs of the past which we hang
onto because it is sometimes
hard to change, .
Consider the problem of
private conversations. Several
years ago the college admin—
istration provided “conversa-
tion" rooms in the Union for
student use, imitating the

Spartans, they made the rooms
uncomfortably sterile in de-
corum; emulating nature, they
made the rooms non-private

(open doors and thin walls)
and opened conversation to
all who were interested, The
result: good intentions on the
part of the administration, but
the problem of finding a placc
for privacy, unsolved, For who
would want to discuss their
domestic problems with the
open hallway or the next room
at the Union? ,

Meanwhile, the other “places”
for homely companionship, the
women’s lounges. are eternally
overﬂowing with people and
the conversation that is strictly
personal goes unsaid. Or, you
take a walk in the subezel'o lowa
night to vent your problem, This
is surely unsatisfactory too.

Solution? If the administra—
tion can assume that the
Grinch student is in general
capable enough to handle a
certain amount of responsi—
bility alone, we think that the
obvious solution to this prob-
lem is the opening of the
dormitories to both sexes at
certain hours. Certainly there
_ would be problems to iron out
before such a radical depart—
ure from precedent could be
instituted But the ultimate
question to answer is whether
or not the students are able
to, and w'lling to, assume,the
responsibility that such free—
dom demands. The opening of
the dormitories (with certain
restrictions) would provide
"private" places where stu~
dents could spend an after-
‘ noon listening to music or an

, evening with close friends in

a situation not vunlike that
which one might ﬁnd at home,
- but delightfully unlike the
>“nublil‘,” dates we are accus»
ton-led to. a

Realistically, there are dis»

 

advantages to the proposal. It
would mean that during those
hours when the halls would be
open, the usual slovcnly speech
and manners would have to be
held in check

Also, there is the undeniable
possibility that certain carnal
instincts might get out or hand.
Here we must say. that, although
this is pel‘hapslthe soundest rear
son to reject the proposal, it
might be considered further.
First, all the students at Grins
nell are old enough to live in
society, and upon leaving Grin»
nell, that is exactly where they
are thrust—in a position where
they must make their own dee
Cisions in regard to morality,
Moreover, many of the illicit
activtties which one might im-
agine would go on in the open
dormitories, would certainly go
on anyway, Man is man and
man will be man whether you
try to keep him from being man
or not

It is finally 2 matter of re»
sponsi lity . whether to
grant it or no, Our suggestion
is to grant it, but at first in
prudently small and trial
doses. For examnle, how about
opening the balls on Saturday
afternoon and evening each
week to couples or groups. Al-
low the students this respon-
sibility and gauge the quality
of the response,

A movement in a direction to-
ward at more liberal system of
social regulations in the area of
open dorms and in other areas
seem desirable to us, but before
such a change can be instituted,
the essential, interest must come
fromrthe students.

Editor's note: The 5&3 will
run a poll during the next
week to determine students'
reaction to’suggesieﬂ changes

 

in the social program at Grin— ,

neu. Results of this poll ‘will
appcar in next Friday's issue.
