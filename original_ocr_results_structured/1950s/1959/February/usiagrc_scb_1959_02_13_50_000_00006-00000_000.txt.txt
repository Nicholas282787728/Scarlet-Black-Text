The iM basketball league is
running true to form with three
halls deadlocked for the tot.
spot with approximately one
third of the season completed.

one loss, and Smith and Cowles
with identical 6-2 records me
the leaders with Rawson and
clerk running close behind with
tour wins and two losses. Gates,
South, and North have tailed
to win a game and are bringing
up the rear. The league Elandv

as follows:

All six of the top leafns are
still very much in contention
tor the title. At this point, it
looks like a hall can lose as
many as three games and still
come out on top. The general
consensus is that this year’s
1M basketball league is the best
in recent years, and consequent-
ly, the hall that emerges the
winner will have made quite an
accomplishment and can righte
fully feel very proud.

lending scorer at this point in
the campaign averaging 27.0
points per game alter two eon-
tests. Jack Woods, playing for
North Younker’s A team, is in
the runner-up slot in scoring
with a 23.3 average for three
games. There is a total of six
men averaging 20 points or bet.
ter which is also quite an ime
provernent over recent years.
However, this increase in scorv
ing can be partially explained
.‘by the increased length of the

to ten-minute quarters received
a second vote of conﬁdence in
a recent 1M board meeting and
will remain in effect through-
out the rest of the schedule.
