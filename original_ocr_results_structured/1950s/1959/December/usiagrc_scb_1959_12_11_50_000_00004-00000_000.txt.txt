Ancl Tomorrow'

by Dale Furnish
Instead of going “home
for the holidays”, Grinnell
swimmers will travel to
Galeshiirg, Ill, for the Knox
relays tomolrow.

The entire varsity squad,
along with seven members of
the freshman team, will make

nual meet that teatures diving
as its only individual event.
Listed on tomorrow‘s schedule
card are seven three and four-
man Varsity relays and four
such races for first year com-
petitur‘s.

ierence schools they didn’t sec
last weekend in. Minnesota.
Lawrence, Knox, Cornell and
Monmouth will all be in at-
tendance tomorrow, along
with tour other top—night
small college teams irom the
area.

Last weekend at the Min—

nesota Time trials, the Gri -

ncll swimmers turned in l
many fine perfomnances, and .
though no official team scores

were compiled, they were

second only to Minnesota of

the Big Ten in number of

places wnn.’They finished far I
ahead of Gustavus Adolphus

and Carleton, the next two

small college teams.

, Turning in particularly good
races at Minneapolis were Stanl
Norman. whorchumed to a'
first in the 50-yd. free-style
and a third in the 100; Art
'Johnson, who teak'second in
lthe loo-yd. backstroke; Bill
Herman, who copped second in
the 100~yd. buttertly; and fresh—
man .rim Cross, who finished
tourth in the event Norman
won. .

Johnson and Herman were
beaten only by the Minneso-
t2 university swimmers, and
I Norman’s victory was termed

the outstanding race of the
‘ day by Simone. Although he’

got a bad start, Norman easily
overtook the rest of his heart
and skimmed in with a time ~
l of 23.2 seconds.

Following tomorrow’s meet.l
some of the Grinnell swimmers
will take off on a sixeday jaunt
through the Southwest. Thev
trip, ﬁnanced by the team'
