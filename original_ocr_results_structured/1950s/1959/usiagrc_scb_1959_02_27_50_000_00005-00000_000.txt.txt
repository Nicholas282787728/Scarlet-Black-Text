Grinnell’s basketball sea~
‘on ended on a sour note
here last Tuesday night
'hen Coe upset the Pica
eers 62‘54. Listless and
loppy after having its
itle hopes dashed at St.
Olaf last weekend, Grin—

ell stayed even with the
{ollztwks for the first fif-
teen minutes, at which
uoint the score was tied\

In the next five minutes
Coe pulled away to a 33.27
halftime lead and Grinnell
was never able to make up
the lost ground. A closing
rally got within six points,
but it was too little, too late,
as the game had already been
decided.

Paul Kantzler played one
oi his best games for the
ioneers as he kniied through
the Cue deiense fmr several
driving lay—ups and ended
with 16 points to lead Grin-
ncll scoring. Seniors John
Copeland, Lee Moses, Denny
Collis, and Kantzlcr played
their final game for the Pia-

week-end the team
Joumeyed to Northiield,
Minn, to take on Carleton

trip for the Pioneers as two
ictories were needed if they

were to remain in the can»

In this situation

rinnell would have had to

lass unscathed through its ii-

of in remaining trio of con.
tests for the Pioneers to tie
them.

Grinnell cleared the iii-st
hurdle when it came ironi
behind to down Carleton so-
15. In this game Bill McClin-
tock poured in 35 points, a
total which stands as the
fourth highest ever made by a
Crinnell basketbnll player.

The next night, however.
St. Olaf engaged the Pioneer
cagers in a nip-and—tuck bat-
tle which went right to the
Wire. Luck was not with the
Grinnellians. for as the lead
changed back and forth in
closing minutes, St. Olaf was

seconds remaining. A iinal
shot fell short and the score
remained 71-69. with Grinnell
on the short end.

proud. Coach John Ptilsch

12.4 loop mark. this marks
the best basketball on the
Grinch ciunpns in tour years.

The fine record was first and
foremost a team effort. Pfitsch
has throughout the season
used his reserves in any and
all situations. with highly rec

warding results.

The rebounding and scoring

of Jim Simmons should be
noted as a big factor in Grim
nell success, as should the
scoring of McCllntock, next
year's caylain, and the fine,
steady play of the ca-capiains,
Kanlzler and Copeland, but it
has been the flrc and deter-
mination of the entire squad
that has gotten the Sol: done.

Prospects for next year are
bright because all except the
aforementioned seniors will be
back and a strong freshman
team promises to add bench
strength and possibly even a
starter or two.

1‘? nm

For lrackmen

Tomorrow at 1 pm. Grin-

nell varsity and freshmen
trackmen meet Iowa State
Teachers college at Cedar
Falls. ISTC has already
crushed Cornell, last year's
Midwest Conference champc
ion, 79.25, Last year Grin—
nell fell victim 92—12.

According to Coach Richard
E. Young, Teachers is espec-
ially strong in the pole vault
and broad jump, with weak—
nesses only in the sprints and
hurdles. Although Grinnell
faces a well-balanced team
with top competitors in almost
every event, Young expects
much improvement over last
week’s performances at Drake.

Despite Drake's seven-week
head start in practice and its
crop oi outstanding freshmen.
Young thought Grinnell run-
ners performed ereditably in
the first practice meet of the
season Thursday, Feb. 19. In»
dirntive of the quality of
competition Grinnell i a c e d
was a 9:435 twormile run by
Drake freshman Tom Rivers,
which was six seconds over
the school trosh record.

Three of Grinnell’s better
performances in Coach Young’s
opinion were Gary Slaybaugh
in the hurdles. Lewis sachs

in the two-mile, and freshman
Garland Hershey in the 440.

The coach is pleased with
the progress of the team and
thinks it is in better condi-
tion than at this time last
year. He emphasized the value
of the tough competition of
Drake and IS’I‘C for Grinnell’s
performance in the WC in-
door track meet ‘in Chicago
next Friday.
