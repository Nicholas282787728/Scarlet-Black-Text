plan and extended payment
plan."

To qualify for a government
loan, the student should make
application at Kaufman’s office.
The National Defense Education
act specifies that preference be

_givell ”to (3) students with a
superior academic background
who express a desire to teach
in elementary or secondary
schools, and (b) students whose
academic background indicates a
superior capacity or prepara-
tion in science, mathematics,
engineering, or a modern fares
ign language"

The borrower signs a promis—
sory noteand repayment is
made to the college according
to terms set up in the note.

The act includes certain spe-
cial requirements not imposed
by the college in the student
loan fund it ordinarily handles.
According to the act, “ . . be-
fore any money from a National
Defense student‘loan fund may
be made available by the col»
legs to the student borrower,
the student must sign an affi-
davit stating that he does not
believe in, and is not a meme
ber of an organization that be.
lieves in or teaches the over-
throw of the United States gov-
ernment by iorce or violence;
and subscribe to an oath or
affirmation of his allegiance to
the United States of America.
and of his readiness to defend
its Constitution and laws against
all enemies."

Regarding the loyalty oath ‘

and disclaimer ailidavit, Pres-
idcnt Howard E. Bowen stat-
ed, “The propriety of these
conditions has been seriously
questioned by a number of
educators who feel, as o mat~
ter- of principle, that issues of
individual and academic tree-
doiu are at stake, for example,
the Commission of the Asso-
ciation of American colleges
last Week issued a stmng
statement on the subject.

“Acceptance of the conditions,
i believe, is a matter for de-
cision by the individual bore
rower. The college should not
Dre-judge the issue for the indi—
vidual student by denying him
the opportunity to secure a gov.
emment loan if he is willing to
accept the conditions required
by law.

“However, sudents who in
conscience cannot accept the
conditions may be assured that
the college will make every
effort to provide loans from
other sources."
