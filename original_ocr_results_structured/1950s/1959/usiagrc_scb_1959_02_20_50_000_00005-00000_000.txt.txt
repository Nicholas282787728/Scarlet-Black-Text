then, we ask, are the c of HP

tional revenue tor the operation
at washing machines on North
and South campus?" Speaking
only tor the c oi HF, this state-
ment is erroneous. Although the
origin ot the iunds tor the or.

has not yet been ascertained,
the money now being used {or

obtained from the operation of

attended by rresident and Mrs,
Bowen, Dean Gardner, Dean
and Mrsi'Peisner, and the
AWSB, a total or 23 persons.
The washing—machine account

with either our semester allot—
ment or the money which we
receive troin fines has at this

the washing i biiics under the

because the c oi HP iii-st saw
the need ioi such a service and
tuck action.

Our second aceountto which
I reicred is comprised or our
semester 'iillotiiient from the
social the anti money collect-
cd iroin tines. Most expendi-
tures irom this account are for
operating expenses or dam-
ages caused by college men;
in addition, we have been
able to aid other organizations
during the past year.

The balance cairied forward
in our general account April
1953 was $691.39. Added to this
in September was $250 troin the
social ice and additional money
irom tines. Major expenditures
since April, 1953 have been as
iollows flashlights, $1464; dame
ages incurred in spring riot. $50;
movie projector ior the men’s
athletic department, $150; porch

As or last Monday the bal-
ance oi our general'account is
$534.50. However, we will‘ pres—
ently be receiving $250 irom
the semester social tee and will
have an expenditure ct slot) for

balance will then be at approx-
imately $555.

cause this pol' 'v has lollowed
in last you spring riot, our
treasury much larger than
usual.

As is stated, we have _inade
donations to various organiza-
tions when we ielt the cause
important, but we are reluo
tant to doglhls oltcn because we
must maintain a siccablc bal-
ante/in our treasury to cover
any property damage which
might occur. The latter is the
reason ior such a small group
having so much money. it
might be remembered also that
the C of HP is a representative
body, and as such carries on
the business of the men oi
Gi-iiincll college.

According to the editorial
(paragraph tour), the .AwSB
has a more desirable method

-a mass meeting oi all women
students. Why then has it
suddenly been proposed that
the women entrust their repr
resentative bodies with this

in attempting to answer
questions posed by the editorial,
others have undoubtedly been
raised and will be answered it
possible. Yes, student govern
inent does have detects and
without student interest some
might never be rcctiticd. but
criticism from hear-say is prac-
tically worthless. It is hoped
that this letter has eleaicd up
some of the misconceptions
which are entcitaincd by cer—
tain people.

to allot $375 iroin the wash—

Since the. AWS Board is L'iv-
