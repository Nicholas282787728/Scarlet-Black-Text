Recommends New Course, Grade Plans

CONT. FROM P. 1

In the second week of April,
a full report of the seniors work
for the year would be submit-
ted to his department. This
would include his reading, in
dependent projects and courses
All of the year's papers and re-
ports would be appended. From
April until the term’s end, he
would prepare for a final oral
examination which might be
followed by a supplementary
written examination if the de-
partment were in doubt as to
the student's qualifications for
graduation.

PRINCIPLES EXECUTED

In the opinion of the commit-
Lec, ”the general Curricular pat-
tern outlined above would carry
out certain principles which
may be summarized as follows:

“(1) that work in the liber-
a1 arts and in the field of con-
centration continues throughout
the four years but with increas-
ing emphasis from one year to
the next on the field of concen-
tration;

"(2) that there are educative
values in a curriculum which
at several points in the stu—
dents' progress toward gradua-
tion provides for courses bring-
ing the students in a class to-
gether in a common academic
experience relevant to this pro-
gress;

"(3) that opportunity for in-
dependence and student respom
sibiljfy for his own education
increases from year to year, to
some extent for all studenm,
very substantially for “unusuaL
ly capable" students;

“(4) that there are educative
values, affecting the whole cur-
ricular philosophy, in examina-
tion on achievement in the lib-
eral arts and on progress in
the field of concentration if the
examination occurs at a time
when the student's achievement
is comprehensive and when his
progress is sufficient to serve
as the basis of further educa-
tional planning;

“(5) that the students‘ pro—
gress toward graduation is in-
til-nately related to increasing
emphasis on individual advising
and practice of the tutorial con-
cept and to decreasing emphasis
on requirements and rules.”

FRESEMAN AND SOPHO-
MORE STUDIES '

The studies sequence which
has been suggested as an addi-
tion to the curriculum is de—
signed to bring students together
in a “common academic exper-
ience" which will suggest “the
interrelationships of the liberal
arts and the aims of liberal ed-
ucation; and to provide a con~
tlnuing point of reference in ihe
student's activities in and out
of class as he progresses to-
ward graduation."

The committee hopes that this
will circumvent student distrust
in “any suggestion of interrela-
tionships of the liberal arts . . .
His (the student's) academic
unit is the individual class, and
his social unit is the hall; and
in a community small enough to
be comprehended. he seldom

gets together with the college
as a community.”

ADDITIONAL GOALS

Othei‘ objectives of the pros
gram arc to orient students to
the liberal arts college’s empha—
sis on “relating facts to the
first principles,” to provide
students with the tools neces-
sary to the pursuit of their own
educations; to bring students
“into association with a selec-
tion of important ideas and
issues" regarding values, goals
and social relationships; and to
equip students With the funda-
mentals for the future study of
their interests.

The studies courses would in
clude reading, writing and dis
cussions based upon selected
texts (the committee specifies
that these are not textbooks)
which. coupled with the ideas
presented by various lecturers,
would give the student “a com-
mon core of matter highlighted
. . . by the normal, healdiy di~
versity of the various fields of
knowledge."

DRA‘V 0N DIVISIONS

Centered in certain of the
broad curricular divisions (lite
erature, social sciences, philoso-
phy, fine arts, etc.), the courses
would draw materials and staff
from each of the various areas.
“However, the courses would
not be a ‘bird’s eye view’; they
would not be of the survey type,
and “integration” of the differ-
ent fields would not be the
theme."

The first semester of fresh-
man studies would “seek to ex»
hibit man in his characteristics
as a purposive, moral creature;
and thus to stimulate the stu-
dent’s responsible examination
of himself and to increase his
awareness of the centrality of
value judgments to his free
meaningful living and, espec—
ially in the coming four years,
to his own educational enter-
prise.”

To serve as examples of the
correlative possibilities of the
program, a set of interrelated
texts has been suggested by the
committee, including “Victory”
by Joseph Conrad, “Uses of
Knowledge" by Newman and
“Apology of Socrates" by Plato,
the “Book of Job" and Archi-
bald MacLeish’s ”J. 13.”, the
“Thoughts" of Pascal, the
“Chocphoroe” of Aeschylus and
“The Flies" by Sartre.

RELATE MAN T0 SOCIETY

Freshman studies n would
“seal( to relate moral man,
valueholding and goal—seeking,
to certain of the social insti-
tutions he has developed; and
thus to stimulate the student’s
responsible examination of the
society in which he lives and
of his relationships—actual, pos-
sible, desirableito it.

"What kind of society do we
live in. with respect to social
institutions and prevailing, cone

lpreparation regarding each text,

flitting values and goals and
with respect to relations of in<
dividuai to society?”

Among the texts suggested to
elucidate the theme are “Elm-
town’s Youth” by sociologist A.
B. Hollingshead, "Politics—Who
Gets What, When, How” and
“Economic Basis of Politics" by
political scientists Harold D.
Lasswell and C. A. Beard, re-
spectively, and “The Acquisitive
Society" by economist R. H.
Tawney or “The Afﬂuent So~
ciety” by J. K. Galbraith. To
define the issues faced, the so-
cio-economic approach of Rob-
ert L. Heilbroner in “The
Worldly Philosophers" is sug-
gcsted.

QUESTS STUDIED

Sophomore studies “without
prctending to give an account
of the welter or individual
quests or those of groups and
movements, of sects and
schools," would attempt to fee
cue “the student’s thoughtful at—
tention on certain of man’s
broad questing activities."

Among these quests would be
the quest for certainty. ap—
proached through philosophy
(eg. Bertrand Russell's “New
Hopes for a Changing World”),
through religion (John Dewey’s
“A Common Felt ") and
through science (J. B. Conant’s
“On Understanding Science”).
Similar treatment would be
given the quest for creativity
through the verbal and non-
verbal arts via Curt Ducasse’s
“Philosophy of Art."

COURSE PLAN

ln freshman studies I and
freshman studies 11 the follow-
ing course plan would ‘be put
lnlo effect:

(1) reading and analysis of
four or live texts, preferably
texts available in “paperback"
edition; “short" writing exer—i
cises. no “term" projects.

(2) discussion sections of 25
to so students.

(3) instructors drawn froml
the relevant curricular area:
mainly from the language and
literature division for freshman
studies I and from the social
studies division for freshman
studies ll.

(4) lecture at the beginning
and at the end of each unit, by
faculty members who are ”spec-
ialists" in the area of the unit.

(5) “study conferences" of in-
structors held regularly for

under the direction of faculty
members who are “specialists"
in the area of the unit.

in sophomore studies a simi-
lar course plan would be put
into effect. However, considera~
tlon would be given to the
question of which of the follow-
ing alternatives is better: (I)
each discussion section contin~
uously under the same instruc-
tor; (2) each discussion section
under a different instructor for

each unit. In the second alter-
native, there would be a rota-
tion of instructors. so that each
unit would be dealt with by
faculty members who are "spec-
ialists" in the area of the unit;
and further. the order of the
units would differ from section
to section.
