Last July, I watched the Sen-
ate debate on the Kennedy-
Clark bill to repeal the loyalty
oath provision ot the National
Defense Education Act. Last
week, I advanced an argument
opposing Grinnell‘s refusal toll
accept funds under the act. ‘

I do not accept that argu-
ment because I saw that it
meant something [or Senator
Clark to list the many col-
leges opposed to the oath and
for Senator Young to mention
the few so opposed that they.
refused innds, and ior sena—
tors‘ to say' to‘ their colleagues!
. "The ,colleges are. opposed.‘
Some very fine colleges even _
go so tar as to refuse grants
under the act."

It meant even more, 13011;:sz
"for Senator Javits to say, “if
, have received thousands of let-'

ters from students protesting’
the loyalty oath provision."

I’don’t know how many Grin-
nell students wrote letters of
protest, but I do knqw that the
faculty‘ is fighting our battle
for us by putting Grinnell ’in

‘ the extreme opposition to the
, léyalty oath provision. This col»
lege adds prestige to'the list,
even if its studemsvdh not add
~,letters tq Lhe thousands. .

I do not ,deny that it iSruns
foﬂunnte that we students
either did not have, _or did l
not have the opportunity to'
display; the sensitivity to in» i.

it is this that brings me to a
second argument which 1 heard.
in Washington, in opposition to
Grinnell’s position and its basic
principles. Everym'le should be
glad to sign a loyalty oath.
Anyone who objects is to be
regarded with suspicion, for
