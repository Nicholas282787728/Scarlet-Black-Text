Mount Olympus
To the Editor:

At a recent. convocation of (ht:
gods, Mr. Stocking's last. column
was discussed. The gods have
long been displeased with

Sisters. The decision was Touche:

ed that it all began with the
Revolution and their
identitieation (as, Mr. Stocking
pointed out) with Madame
Farge, knitting rrom patterns
that would not lit the yarn,

Since the good old days or
antiquity, when things were
much simpler, uncomplicated
by those who eame along and
made claims to being gods oi
heroes, the gods have suiicr.
ed some corruption. Untort—
unately, Zeus has been anay
supervising constant world
wars, and has left the state in

the hands or Hera, who has
spent much oi her time play-
ing with her Golden Applc of

Discord.

She has been negligent in hei
administration ot the Weird Sis-

tens, whose fangs and C12“: have,

grown sharp on the tangle ot
vi ims they have woven into
(hell w.eb

Further trouble has been
their oontrollcrship of the
Dclphic Oracle, and contrary
to law, their publication of
Oracle news in the Grapevine
Press.

As you

three who arbitrarily controlled

were Clotlio (ii-om Greek hlotlio
— to draw thread trom
distatr), Lachcsis (from Greek
lagchano # to assign by lot),
and Atropos (from Greek
atropos 7 inflexible) However,
when Medcth became a Broad»

themselves much in vogue and
expanded their membership to
the present eight,

With a vindictive sense of
humor, they- established the
chaste Artemis. goddess of the
moon and huntrcss of men, as
the idol of young women. and
decided that all such young
women must be knitted and
knotted in that shape They
chortled all through the Salem
witch hunts, upheld the Puri-

straighlway bring report back
to them.

Most or the gods acre appallr

ful at the lassitudc that permits
ted such practices to go on un~

Oracle must hereafter proclaim
these words for men (and Grin—
nellians) to read.
