Al Grinnell College? Impossible!

A couple of days ago a fantastically unbelievable story
reached our crusading cars It Went something like this:
One night last week it Read hall freshman woman, comply-
ing with the AWSB rules, was in bed in her room with the
lights off by 11 pm. She then realized that the window
in her room was open too Wide and remembering that \she
had not had her flu shot, she left her bed and put aforesaid
window down.

At this point the tale becomes an obvious fabrication.
According to the story, this freshman’s “baffleboard” came
into the room, saw her out of bed and this led to campus—
ment.

To the AWSB we strongly suggest that they trace
down the origin of this perversion of the truth; this men—
dacity; this mealy-mouthed Machiavellism and explain to
this teller of tales that such provincialism; such narrow—
mindedness; such misdirected Puritanism could not and
does not exist on south campus Explain to this misguided
young adult that you and the “baffleboards” are, in fact,
dedicated to her progress, that this ridiculous campusment,
has no logical nor any moral basis and is below everything
you hold most sacred.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Acid
and
Base

by John Stocking

The administration's unfamie
liarity with Grinnell student life
is demonstrated when, in trying
to improve student life, the mem-
bers of the administration apply
lprcssure for the removal of a
trivial distracting element such
as prepping and leave unmolested
a big distracting clement. Consie
der the one distraction of which
i am going to speak, for it wastes
more study hours in a year than
prepping has in Grinncll college
history.

Several trusty graduates have
told me that, before 1952, the
men’s hall clubrooms were can
ters ior conversation and dis
cussicn. places to study in good
company and perhaps meet for
a friendly excursion to the Rex
or the Union. But daikncss has
spread over our clubrooms since
1952.

In 1953 the people in the club.
rooms can not hear to make
conversation, let alone carry
on discussion; in fact, they can
not even see who is in the
room. study is impossiblcl
Reading the sports section is
i impossible! They sit like dolts
in the dark; and like so many
procrastinating housewives, pro-
l erastinate away their learning
i hours, Yes, in 1952 the televi-
l sion set replaced the trophy
case as the dominant feature
of the clubroom.
When the house president tries
llo bring the houscmecting to or-
der, he is hissed for turning
down the Tv. When Joe Blow
tries to play Mozart on the
piano, he is cast out for disrupt-
ing “77 Sunset Strip." The guys
won‘t make the 1M game because
“Peter Gunn" is en. Believe me,
nothing is allowed to disrupt
the sacred message that.flows
across the airways from Madison
ave. to Grinnell college.

You say they could turn it
oil if they wanted to? Non-
sense! Tv is an opiate, a l
method of escape. The alco-

To the Editor: I

Prepping is over. But beforel
it is filed away in remote parts
of a thousand or so memories
I lccl impelled to submit a
strong point of view. in the hope
that both these elements which
already stand in opposition to
the system and those which
might hereafter be inclined to
\do so will unite and take posi-
tive action,

There are two characteristics
of the prepping program
which, despite recent reforms,
remain particularly disconcert-
tantaanount to a violation of
the most tundarnental of hu-
man rights. These characteris-
tics, stripped of their pret-
enses, each represent a type of
ing. The two combined are
assault, the one on body and
the other on mind and spirit.

1 refer, on the one hand, to
“swatting” and other physical
acts committed under the guise
of orientation, and on the other,
to a multiplicity of indignities
ranging from the most extreme
lkind of vulgarity to the child-
ish but none the less degrading
customs of "buttoning" and pie»
hell night costumes, which
freshmen are compelled to suf—
fer both in llousemectings and
on campus, The argument
against this kind of a program
is generally stated in terms of
Griiinelrs professed educational
objectives and runs approximate-
ly thus:

It is admitted by nearly
everyone that the present prep-
ping program hears practically
no relation to the problems of
adjustment and integration fac—
being so, why retain it’? Why
not create a system which

lioiic can‘t turn down the beer
thrust daily under his nose.
Can the dope fiend put,aivay
the needle without help? Can
the smoker stop smoking just
because it‘s a waste of cash
and may kill him? No! No!
Dope must be controlled by
law; and the narcotic hogwash
flowing lrom the infernal tube
must be controlled in a similar
way. Our clubrooms were de
signed for student use, not for
industrialist propaganda centers

ferd
ed by the incoming student. This
could truly assist in freshman
orientation?

These responding to this
criticism contend that while it
is true that prepping and 01‘-
ientnlion are entirely unre-
lated, prepping is thought by
one and all (0r almost all)
9.0 be “fun," and “full" is more
important and certainly more

. run than orientation anyway,

At this point interest dwin-
dies.

Opponents of prepping are
forced to concede that support
of the prepping system by a
majority of students is decisive,
and the administration, with
touching paternal understanding,
extends its fatherly indulgence
and condones a certain amount
of “fun," as long as it is rea-
sonable; reasonable meaning
that it be confined to quarters
where it can neither embarrass
college personnel nor create ad-
ministrative irrcgularities But
it is at this very point that re-
gard for individual human rights
vanishes altogether.

1 ask, quite simply, what
right does any Grinnell student
have to strike another person7
What right does any student
have to scream Obscenities at his
fellow students? Since when
are Grinnell students exempt
from all legal and moral laws
regarding assault, slander and
calumny? How is it that human
dignity has been subordinated
tohall membership and the
mane procedures through which
it is attained?

i am aware that this is an
extreme and melodramatic
statement. However, I am fully
convinced that is truthful and
highly relevant, I ask not that
time he spent in contriving
clever retutations of this pos-
ition. That is easy. I ask the
more diificult task: that each
person turn his full rational
powers, his judgment and his
conscience inward, and after
rigorous and honest examina-
tion of the values found there-
in, decide whether support or
the prepping program is con-
