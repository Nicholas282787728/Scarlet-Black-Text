hops they were anticipating too,
much. AL any rate the students,
showed little oi the custoxnal'y‘
enthusiasm that is expected
after such a concert; the ohjcc—
tions were quite emphatic and;
appeared in the school newspa-
per from students who had orig—
inally been the strongest sup—
porters of the Kingstons.

The objections centered
around two points which I coir
sider most valid. First, the cou-
cert was only one hour long,
even though the contract stipu-
lated two hours. Secondly, ale
most their entire program, in-
cluding jokes, could be bought
for about $8 at any rccord store
carrying the Trio's albums.

We paid the tint guarantee
with no percentage. When I
realized that the concert was
mlly going to be an hour, I
regretted having even given
thorn the guarantee; however.
1 was sure that they would
not extend their program and
it t withheld the check for a
,time it would only cause u
due inconvenience for all no
cerned..l-iowevcr, I did ques»
tion the tact that the concert
was only one hour and was 35‘
sured by their road manager
that this was the usual pro—
gram.

I think the Trio was unhappy“
with the position of ttie stage.
I agree that it should have been
placed differeiltly, However.
other groups have perfo‘l'med
here with great succcss on such
inadequate facilities, and 1 don‘t
think that the stage affected'
the Trio's program a nicklc‘s
worth, Their progﬁni was very
wcll received at first, but when
they Conti‘ cd to sing their
well'lcno 'n songs the atmos—
phere quickly cooled

I hope that my comments will
he of value to you t can as—
sure you that it is. an honest
appraisal of the cone and the‘
mildcst form of and sin that
has been expressed at Grinnell.

I realize that the Trio has
been attracting huge crowds
and much larger ices than
Grinnell gave them, but I also

Lilly Grants $10,000 For “Fat-tilly‘Slirllulalion"

A $10,000 giant "for the
broad purpose of faculty im—
proveincnt and stimulation" h
Just been made to Grinnell col-
lege by Lilly Eidowmcnt. lnc..
Fi'csldent How d R. Bowen
has announced

This is one ol 22 grants
made by Lilly Endowment to
undergraduate colleges “in
recognition or the loot that
the maintenance or satisl‘dCr
tory standards or faculty pcr-
iorninnec will he a colililm»
ing problem in American
higher education, even in the
better Institutions.”

The fund, lo be tended over,

know that the quality at pr -
gram they presented at Gri .
nell was worth little more
than the 38 it would cost to
buy the same program on rec—
ords,

Certainly the Trio made it
quite dillieult tor those of us
whom the students hold respon—
sible tor the concerts to yustiry
the $1750 expenditure. We are
well accustomed to criticism, I
can assure you. but usually we
have something which we can
delend. '

Sincerely yours,
