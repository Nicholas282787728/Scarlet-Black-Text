thereby reducing the expense
or operation. Next your. the

“At uriliiicll we value the
educational contributions or
the AFROTC program," Bowen
said, “and the personal qual-
: itics or the oiiiccrs and air-
nicn assigned to our detach»
incnt have been outstanding.
For the enrollment oi our iiie
stitution, the production or
commissioned oiiiccrs has been
good, although we recognize
the cost or their trnining to
. the Air Force has been higher
‘ than at institutions having
larger enrollment

"We are glad to cooperate
with the Air Force in agreeing
to a change in administration
which will prove both economi—
,eal and educationally sounc,"
