highly rated by Pioneer coach
Bab Peterson on the basis of
past performances, Grim-tell
seems to be the underdog in
both meeis. Grinnell’s chances
of winning are also somewhat
Weakc'ned because of a knee

Bruce Wilkerson.

The Saturday meet against
Knox, winner of the Knox 1n-
vitational wrestling meet ealu

neer matmen. Grinnell’s show.
ing against Knox will serve
as an indication of the grap»
plers’ chances of placing in
the conference meet the iol-
lowing weekend

Knox is particularly strong
in the middle weights, having
a potential conference champ»
ion at 147 lb. in undefeated
Harry Rowe, At 167 lb. may
have Bob Reiners who was
conference champion at 157
lb. last year. Lombardi, at 157

Omaha unlverslty, who de-
feated the Pioneers earlier in
the season, 21-11.

Last Saturday the wrestling
team won its second dual
meet of the seasgn, beating
Coe 13.10, Patton, at 130 lb.

won by iorfeit. Gray, who
moved up to the 147 lb. weight
class, lost a decision 7—3.
Simpson and Van Amooy both
won decisions, 5.2 and d3, re-
spectively.

The surprise match of the
afternoon was in the heavy.
weight class. Weitzman, sub»
stituting for injured Wilker—
son, tied Bob Houdek of Gas
0.0. Houdek is considered by
conference coaches to be one
of the three best heavyweights
in the conierence. Coach Pet»
erson feels that Weitzman's
rapid improvement this season
gives the team added strength
at heavyweight and makes it
possible for Weitzman to spell
Wilkerson, enabling Bruce to
recuperate from his injury.

Tomorrow the Grinnell
swimming team will meet the
University of Nebraska swims
mers at Lincoln. The contest
is expected to be very close,
with Nebraska slightly favor—
ed due to the fact that Grin-
nell, accustomed to a 20-yd.
pool, will be swimming in a
25-yd. pool.

However, the meet will
provide a good opportunity
for Grinnell to practice for
the imminent Midwest Com
ference meet.

Last Saturday the arm-
nell swimmers triumphed in
a quadrangle meet here. The
final scores were Grinnell,
77; Gustavus Adolphus, 611/2;
Illinois Normal, 26 and Mon.

To the Editor:
1t seems that the issue of
school spirit during the bay
ketball season is discussed cv-
cry year—usually to no avail.
It means a great deal to any
team to have the support be.
hind thcm and this ycar this
is what we've had. Thc team
would like to extend its sin-
cere thanks to the entire stuv
dent body for its support.
We, as representatives tor
the team, would like to say
that our student body has
had more spirit and enthusir
asm than any of the schools
at which we played. It meant
a great deal to the team to
have the followers at the Cue.
and Cornell away games. This
helped neutralize the “hams
court advantage" and was a
factor in our victories.
ln the last home scries
against Monmouth. Knox and
Cornell the. showing was the
best it possibly could have
been. It was even so good
against Knox that it helped
us “clutch" ourselves out of
the victory. Then, after the
bad night, thc full gym on
Monday was a large factor in
getting us back on the road.
We did our best and want
to thank you for yours.
