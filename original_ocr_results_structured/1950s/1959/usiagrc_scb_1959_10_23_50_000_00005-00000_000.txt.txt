at halftime with a comfort—

Hartuug‘s last excursion was
good for twelve yards and the
touchdown. This time Smith
attempted the placement, but
Beluit again broke through to
block the ball.

'After an exchange of punts,
Grinhell went on the march

The picture changed almost
as soon as the second half
began, Belolt kicked off and
recovered a Grinnell fumble

Piolteors’ 36-yard line they
gnmmd their way to the thir-
teen, where the Buccaneers
quarterback, Jinn Kuulic, car-
ried six straight times before
getting the touchdown iron-l

rich kicked for the extra point.

After a good kick-off return
by Hartung, Grinnell got no-
where and was forced to kick.
Beloit brought the punt back to
the Pioneers’ 47 and drove from
there to the ten~yard line be—

pass and an alert Dick Harris
intercepted.

The Pioneers were unable to
get out of the hole, however,
for a fumble gave the ball back
to Beloit just three plays later.
Beloit fought from the eleven

a drive that carried to the

pass lost five yards, the drive

was over and so was the final
threat to Beloit's lead.

Even in defeat the Pioneers
had their standouts. Hartung
was tremendous throughout the
game and finished with a total
of 144 yards in 21 carries, plus

one jaunt of eleven yards which
was nullified by a penalty
Much of the credit for Hartung's
superlative running should go
to eta-captain Dick Yaki, who

was deadly with his blocking,
cutting the feet out from under
anyone who got in his way.

The Pioneers meet St. Olaf
without the services of junior
fullback Jim Lowry. Lowry
sustained a back injury in the
Beloit game and it is doubt—
ful whether he will See any
action during Grinnell’s re-
maining three games. Except
for this illju-YY,‘the Pioneers
should be at full strength in

to'fnomow’s contest.

 

Head football coach Bob
Peterson was pleased with his
squad’s morale during practice
sessions in preparation for the
St. Olaf encounter. He express-
ed Confidence that Grinnell has
a good chance to come back vic-
torious, since there was little
indication of a generalteam“let-

down”. following the Pioneer's
onerpomt Homecoming defeat
last Saturday

coach Peterson indicated
that he will start with the
same lineup that began
against Beloit. However Haig
Koshkariau 'll assume a
halihrck position due to Low-
ry’s absence. John Hartung
will move to fullback and Ron
echsncr will take the other
halfback position. Bob Woito
will quarterback the Grinnell
oficuse.

_ Grinnell’s starting offensive
line includes Terry Moore at
center, Bud Hulse and Frank

Scott at the guard positions, Ron
Gustavson and Dick Yaki at the
tackles, and Jim Simmons and
Bob Rikkers at the ends
