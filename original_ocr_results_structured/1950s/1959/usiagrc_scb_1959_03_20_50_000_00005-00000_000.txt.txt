“Men and businesses are alike in one respect," says
Gerald Au Parsons, 30-year»old marketing and per-
sonnel development specialist, “Their success dc-
pends to a great extent on how well they respond to
Challenger And I’ve found that the biggest challenge
a man has to face on his job is not the competition of
others — but the far more important one of develop-
ing himself to his fullest capabilities.

“During my four years with General Electric,
I’ve had plenty of opportunity for self»devclopmelit,

helping to achieve them. I've found that working
toward future potential ' vital in the development

‘The biggest challenge

ace is himself?

Young me‘il such as Gerry Parson's are important
to the future of companies like General Electric and
to the growth of America’s dynamic, competitiv
enterprise economy Our nation‘s progress will de-
pend more and more upon those forwardnloolt'ing
individuals. who continue to develop to their fullest
capabilities during their lifetime.

That is why General Electric provides a climate
