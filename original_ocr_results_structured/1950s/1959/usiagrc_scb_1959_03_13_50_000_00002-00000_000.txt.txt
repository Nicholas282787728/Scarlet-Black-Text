The Meaning Of “Open Lounges"

Last week the Social Calendar committee voted to allow the
Grinnell student body the use oi north campus “open lounges” on
Friday and Saturday evenings

A commendable move. 1r,

1, The committee realizes that this is NOT a valid test of
the worth oi the "open dorm" system. The students who take ad»
vantage of the “open lounge” are not necessarily the some students
who desire the privacy and study atmosphere that the “open dorm”
system would offer.

2. The council and its president realize that what the com-
mittee has done is definitely not in agreement with the ultimate
wishes of the majority of the students and of the council and that
further efforts on the part of the council should be directed to the
committee to accomplish the ends which the students desire.

3. The students realize that the success of the “open dorm"
proposal depends upon a high level of "morality" on the part ot the
students in the ”open lounges."

4. The students further realize that the Grinnell student body
is probably the most heterogeneous group of “Vonng adults" and
“children of advanced chronological age" that has been brought
together on the face of the earth and that this “polar" group
creates a complex problem for the deans in regard to their respon-
sibility to the majority and minority.

s i i

We would like to put forth a forceful second to Mr. Stocking’s
remarks concerning a radical, dynamic student body which Grln~
nell’s is not. Too often things that might be beneficial to Grinnell
students are not achieved because of the student’s great propensity
for reclining on his posterior and allowing the administration, fac-
ulty, or a handful of students decide what is best for him.

. s o

The deposition of the Dooley case is an example of the way
these “incidents" should he handled. The Grinnell police, often the
target of derogatory attacks on the part of college students, are to
be commended for their efficient manner of apprehending the
assailans. Pitched battle on the village green between college and
town-is not necessary.

To the Editor:
Where Do We Go From Here?
Are Grinnell college studean

-ready and able '10 accept social

responsibility: i.e., do they pos~
sess individual awareness of the
needs and rights of others? Per-
haps they need only a remins
der, but the obvious answer so
far in our limited experiments
with extended women’s hours
and open lounges in both the
men's and women’s dormitories,
is "no,”

We all believe in freedom as
a matter of principle, for with-
out it, neither men nor women
can learn to set their patterns
of behavior, to make choices, or
to evaluate their actions.
basic question is the point at
which individual freedom ends
and the need for regulation be.
gins. In my opinion, freedom
ends when it encroaches upon
the health. happiness, or wel-
fare of other individuals.

In the first trial experiment,
the liberal extension of WI)-
men’s hours with the library
and the Student Union open,
the rule slates that doors at
the Quadrangle will be locked
at 12 on school nights and
12:30 on Saturday nights with
no late permissions except in
cases of (lire emergency So
far in the short experimental
period there have‘bcen three
dozen women late for such
dire emergencies as ”Watch
slow," “watch stopped," or “no
watchi" (There have heel: two
true emergency cam). For
these 0355 many other per~
sons have waited. Grinnell
college is responsible for its
Students, and if one is hurt in
an accident, for insmnce, we
must know, In reality, there is
no complete rest for a number
of people and doors cannot be
locked for the night until
everyone is in.

Furthermore, some students
need sleep and go to bed early,
and what happensl They are
awakened by Lila latecomers
talking merrily in loud tones as
they trip down the loggia, or by
the many couples bidding their
long, fond farewells.

Acid and Base

by John

Do
about as dangerous as the old
women who clean our rooms
each day, and maybe even less
dangerous; for they, .at least,
can vote? Most of us are not
old enough for that, We are not
dangerous as a class, and we
are nearly harmless as individ-
uals.

Do you know that in most
countries the student class,
the class we are supposed to
belong to, is considered to be
one of the most dangerous
classes, it not the most dan-
gerous class? You know, of
course, what students did in
Hungary? In most parts of the
world students are continual.
ly demonstrating/ for causes,
rioting in public squares, and
fighting over political issues.
Their intluence is feared and
respected. They are nearly
always radlcal. They are al»

ways dynamic. They are our

opposite.

No secret service agent will

of some youth group singing
hymns and praying; or if he
were lucky, the sllbicettmlght
be sex. (dither sex or relig—
ion would be preterable when
matched with the south carn-
pus counterparts . . , cloth-
ing and gossip.)

lt would require an army of
Gestapo agents to find one or-
iginal and deeprfelt socially
dangerous idea in the mind of
one Grinnell student, who wasn’t
a crack-pot. Indeed, any Grim
nell student with a sincere rad-
ical idea in his mind is consid
ered a crackpot, if he is a big
enough fool to open his month
about it. in more than one way,
to put it crudely, we are not
worth investigating.

But here is where our worth
does lie. Yearly we consume
billions of dollars of clothes,
and make the clothing mer—
chants prosperous and rat. The
student of the past has been a
tattered and ragged man of the

mind (remember the student in
the Canterbury Tales.) The
merchants did not approve of
his type, because he never
bought anything. Believe me,
the merchanl‘s love us. The big
businessmen love us too. We are
going to run their businesses for
them while they put on weight
beside their swimming pools. We
will be as dependable and
harmless as the machines we
work beside.

That is our heritage, and
you wonder why big indus-
trial giants donate millions to
higher education. The produce
the student class consumes is,
in itself, suliicient reason to
keep higher education on its
feet But, the need for edu-
cated human machines is the
big reason. Yes, our worth
lies in the number of records
we buy, the number of cigar—
ettes we smoke, the gallons of
beer we drink and the num-
ber of textbooks we have to
buy. Our value is in the pa-
tient and obliging years at
work we will do for some
company. We are needed in
the tuture, are being prepared
for the future and will be
used in the future , . . like ad-
ding machines or typewriters.

There is nothing exciting
about being an American stu-
idem. It will be a miracle it
our class is ever respected for
anything outside our ranch
houses and ridiculous automo—
bilest We will never be feared
as a class, tor we will not do
or say anything o: lasting im—
portance . . . unless the boss
tells us to,

When you read of the stu-
dents who march in Paris or
Berlin or Timbuctoo you will
laugh at their pained strivings;
and you will laugh when you
see in news photos the passion-
ate intensity of their facial ex-
pressions. sitting on the Amer»
ican foam rubber cushion you
_,will view their actions as a
strained and comic old time
movie on the ever present TV
screen, But it is the sad truth
that they live a life far more

moving than any we will ever
know.
