Frée Expression-A Bad Thing?

World Needs

Fewer 'Gul‘s'

by Jerry Vooi-his

Nikita Khrushthcv is un—
doubtcdly the most important
person to visit our country over
the past 20 years. or possibly. in
the 20th century. His position
as chairman oi the Council at
Ministers and Communist Paity
scerelai‘v DI the Soviet Union
places him in control oi at least
oneethli‘d or the human race. al-
though the extent or his control
ovci Red China is doubled in
many circles. He is probably
the most powcriul individual on
earth.

in spite oi these roots, there
are many Americans and
Western Europeans who an»
pai-cntly do not know this or
who are too stubborn to ad-
mit it. A person’s attitude is
his own business, but in this
present world in uhich many
thousands at innocent people
have to sutier lor the pugua.
cious and irrational behavior [
oi the hothcarlcd icw, and i
where each state anti all the
members in it act as a unit. it
is important that people who
might behave ioolishly should
be oiiset or controlled in
some way.

Unfortunately.
more sanetuari or cloister
where people can tlee when
sanguine individuals take it up-
on themselves to crack heads,
as there were in the Middle
Ages. Neither is war the com-
paratively saie pastelime it was
then

As much as I admire the
democratic iorm of sovcrnment,
modern world conditions com-
pel individuals to express a
certain amount oi restraint
even toward their cncmies if it
will advance the cause of peace
Dl' survival which at the pres~
ent moment are synonymous

it doesn't help us or not in
at all when a storyeor
trouble—hunting newsman asks

Khrushchev questions like
“\thre were you during the
stalin blood purges and what
were you doing about them?"
Neither is it constructive for
supposedly responsible politi-
cal oi als like the mayor oi
Los Angeles to bring up the
“We will burv "on." state-
ment immediately atter
Khrushchev clariiierl it at a
Washington news conierence.

The displaying ot a siim sa —
ing. "The only good Communist

there are no

is a dead one" is the height of‘

lunacy. Although it may seem
cute to some readers, thcv
would be the. Iii-st to explode
at banners displai‘ed in MOSe
cool or Peiping declaring that
“The only good Christian is a
dead one" or “The only good
capitalist is a dead one" or
”The only good American is a
dead one."

People have the right to free
speech and press as long as they
are not libelous or obscene A
person can speak as lone as it
isn‘t at 2:00 in the morning at
the top or his lungs, in a
crowded residential distr' t.

By the same token, a person
can be as belligerent in his
language as he wishes provid-
ed it doesn't .imtnL'onize cer-
tain important and powerful
oiiicui oi ioreicn countries

to the extent of forcing them 1

to leave this country and
making their people more sus
picious oi us than they al-
rcady are.

If a child plays with tirc, it
is called toolisli but when ce
tain erouos play with atoni-
waiiarc. it is called ”gills” it
our has to be that ioolish and
hothcadrd. to have “guts". then
i wish there were less guts in
this world and more grey mat
ter.

Khrushchev had already caused
