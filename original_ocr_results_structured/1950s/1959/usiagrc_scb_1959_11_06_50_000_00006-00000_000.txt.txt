the year through inJuries,

Bob Woito, from Cedar 1L1-
pids Franklin high school
came to Grim-tell with six let-
ters in football and hasketbnll
and has followed up both
sports at Grinnell. Used main-
ly as a defensive halfback his
first two season, Woito was
inserted in the quarterback
slot this year by Coach Bob
Peterson and has responded
beautifully. With one game
left to go, he has surpassed the
Grinncll season marks for
passing yardage and comple-
tion—despite the fact that he
never threw a pass before this I
war

Dick Yaki, who played his
high school football for Bowen
in Chicago, has also been one of
the Pioneers gridiron stalwarts
for the last three years. A stand
out on both defense and offense,
he is acknowledged to be one
of the deadliest blockers in the
Midwest conference. Yaki earns
ed honorable mention on the
all-conference list both his first
two years.

Bud Hulse, who came to
Grinnell with two football let—
ters from Waukegan, 111., earn-
ed letters his first two years
as a varsity performer. Start-
ing as a defensive specialist
his sophomore year, Hulse
moved into a starting guard
position his inniobyear and
has gone both ways since.
Haig Koshkarian, a high-

school teammate of Hulse's. won
letters in football and wrestling.
Concentrating on the gridiron
sport since his sophomore year,
Koshkarian has seen action on
both defense and offense for

Coach Peterson. .A defensive per—
former in 1958, the little Armen-
ian has been used this season
as a utility back, stepping in
whenever injuries necessitated
shifts in the Pioneer backfield.

Walt Neevel, out this fall
for the first time although he
had three years football ex-
perience in high school, has
been a reserve fullback for
the Pioneers. Neevel is better
known for his prowess in
track, where he has earned
two letters as a top 440 and
220 man.

John Phillips is another Sen-
ior out for the first time. A
transplanted Yankee from Con-
necticut, Phillips never played
football before, but after many
years as a high school and col-
lege basketball player. decided

season as a tackle after two
years as a reserve. He hails
from Calumet high in Chicago.

Roy Simpson, a native of Days
