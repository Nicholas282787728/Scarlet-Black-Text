Stick To The Purpose!

Most of the problems which have arisen in connection
with tomorrow’s convention are the result of last-minute
plans which can be explained in the light of the earlier
convention date, but are nevertheless avoidable, .

As an outcome of the Thursday afternoon deadline
for petitions, 80% of the candidates were undeclared until
that time, and have not campaigned. Most of them are
admitted "jags", but a few have hopes of becoming’dark-
horse nominees. If this should happen, students wollld not
find out the complete qualifications and platform of one
of their nominees until he was one of the two they had
to choose for Student Council president. This situation im-
plies a potential danger as to the quality of the person
elected. -

The last-minute candidates have, on the whole, entered
theiconveiitioii race with the purpose of melting it as long
as possible. It is unfortunate that time limitations do not
allow much of the activity customarily done before the
serious business of the convention, At this point, however,
the convention must be conducted in terms of the existing
situation. ,

'The delegates would be likely to become bored if the
voting were carried over until Sunday. All seem to agree on
this. However, When the convention was'strictly limited,
students responded with‘ plans to defy the limitations. The
task of the convention is to nominate the two best-qualified
candidates. If defying authority becomes more important
than this, the student body will have little chance to elect
a qualified leader. ‘ -

To the Editor:

Regarding Gene Thompson’s
column of February 3, contain
ing an attack on the innocuous
“Grinnell College News" and
the movie schedules: it's true.
We are ALL “Weary oi wading

SCARLET AND BLACK

Sackclolh
And

Ashes

By Gene Thompson

Every so otten 1 am' confront-
ed by n member oi my reading
audience and asked questions
about this column. Why is it
called “Sackclcth and Ashes?”
Because i Want it to be, Why do
i hate athletics? You haven’t
read carefully,‘Why do i hate
south campus, girls, housemos
thcrs, Christmas, Christmas preSA
ants and all forms of govern
ment? Th'ese persons have com-
mitted the fallacy of black and
White. Why do i write about
inconsequentials like bad coiiec,
bull sessions and the weather?
Because sometimes i do not
feel like saying anything imc
portal-it for free, and so i
don‘t.

Somc mcmhcis of the audi«
'cncc come to one moycd,
some are disappointed, some
are contemplating homicide.
Sometimes their criticism is
limited to one word—a ner-
vous rcnction irom too littlc
‘slccp or the streets or n had
lunch,

\And some‘ (a gratifyingly sub—
stantial group, both in number
and intelligence) take the time
to tell me what they think. i
ran into one of those people the
other day and the wnversation
we hall has resulted in this
column. ,

I m not prepared to re-
jnstlfy my stand on all that
l have written since the be-
ginning of the yen. But I
also realize (in spite of my
tone in the first paragraph)
that some of the disappointed
ones my have a point.

Some oi what I said was writ—
ten hnstily, with emotion, and
for the purpose of clearing the
air in my room _ the type
writer as an instrument of ther-
spy.

And some of it (like the
series oi articles on south
campus) was written with
thought and consideration,

with the epithets and direct

c of HP Fines Men;
Establishes Policy

In a busy week of lire-con-
vention activities, the C of
HP found the time to estab-
lish a new policy on break—
ing into college buildings and
fined two men for violating
the drinking rule.

The drinking rule violations
resulted in two fines of $7.50
for a South Younkei‘ freshman
and a South Younker sophoe
more.

Under the new policy, any
unauthorired attempt to gain

entrance into a. locked huild-
’ing or room will result in a
$25 fine. The council; more-
over, is working with the
faculty so that some rooms
will he leit unlocked for stu-
dent use.

John Egan, president of the
C of HP. urged all students, and
especially those students using
the laboratories, to consult with
their department chairman con-
cerning full use of the avail-
able facilities.

The council this week also
discussed improving next year’s
prepping program and changed
the dates for balloting for C
of HP president.

The council will reconsider
the propping problem alter
the presidents have conducted
iurthel- discussions in the
house councils. Among the
suggestions were combining
the johsvaf prcpmaster and
personnel chairman and alter-
ing the program to meet the
needs of the ireshmen more
constructively.

The council also changed the
date for preliminary balloting
forvpresident of the C of HP to
Tuesday, Feb. 26, at special
housemectings. The ﬁnal election

i am certainly aware that
north campus has instances of

to match those of south campus

added that “the college has
never, to my knowledge, made
exceptions to the 2.00 cumula-
tive average required for grad-
nation.”

The dismissal from college was
not a punishment. Norton point-
ed out that ”this action was done
as much in the interest or the
student as of the college. The
decision was not made sudden-
ly; the committee took much
time and consideration in weigh-
ing the cases of the students in—
volved."

Norton said that the Com-
mittcc on Academic standing
does not drop inshmcn mm
the collcgc unlcm spccmi' cir-
cumstances exist; the freshmen ‘
arc customarily given another
chance, if their troubles are
academically based, and it they
:esire the renewed opportun-

y.

Any dismissed student may
appeal to the committee for re»
consideration of his case.
