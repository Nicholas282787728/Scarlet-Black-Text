by Jo Tam

Two exchange students from
Hampton Institute, Hampton,
Va.. arrived at Grinnel] last
Friday to begin
ter’s work in a new and differ!
ent environment.

health education._ Grace is ma-i
jcring in sociology. ;

The other exchange stu-
dent, Bessie Williams, Loose_
hall sophomore, is interested
in home economics and has
filled her schedule with such
requirements as logic, von<
sumer economics, visual arts,
and marriage and the family.

Grace became interested in
attending Grinnell after talking
to students from Hampton who
had been here on the exchange;
program. ,

Bessie said "I couldn’t think‘
of anything in my college ca-’l
reer that could afford me great
or intellectual growth than liv-
ing, studying, and associating
with students having a cultural
background different from my!
own."

The girls agreed they are

To the editors of the 8&3:

‘ In his convocation speech, Dr.
iStevens set out to raise the

questions which will be of greatl
importance during the comlllg
political campaigns He spoke
from his own personal convicc
tions, giving no pretense of im»
partlallty. i

As the talk was not only de.l
signed to give us his own views,
but also to arouse the politically
dormant students on campus, I
feel he is to be commended for
undertaking such a task ivith
such vigor and conviction. i

However, I deeply regret that
he found it necessary to stoop
to the lower levels of Repubr
lican propaganda by saying that
socialism inevitably leads to,;
tyranny. 1 think this showed at
lack of respect for some present
day historical facts. We must
realize that ii large .segment ofi
western Europe is socialist we:
day, and we still refer to thisi
larea as free Europe. 1

So long as these socialist',
countries retain the democtatici
processes, whlch give the peo-
ple the chance to throw out the‘
socialists by the ballot, these
countries are not in“ danger of
tyranny from a system which
seeks a more equitable distribu—
tion of wealth.

Let us hope that in the fu-
ture, when Dr. Stevens does
give us as interesting and vital
a discussion ds\ was the most
recent one, he will exercise a
restraint to keep from uslngl
propaganda phrases, and give.
us instead more of his excellent!
insights.

To the editors ni the S 8: B:

As a paid-up member of the
Grinncll community, I am ex-
pressing my opinion about
Thursday‘s convocation address.
I believe that Dr. Stevens’
speech represented a typical and
lamentable impasse between thel
administration and the students.
I do not intend to attack on
waste time disagreeing witn thel
petty trivia in- Dr. Stevens't
speech; to do so would be he;
neath the dignity and intellectuail
capacities of a Grinnell studc.it.l
I believe that most at the
convocation audience would not
take issue on such minute points
as paying tuition. being dishonest,
etc. 1 think most of us are “big
, to accept such topics
under the guise of “just another,
convo speech,” though we mighti
have preferred such topics dlsA
cusscd at another time and place,
Nor do I believe that most cfi
us would deny or argue the.irn-l
parlance of Dr. Steveus‘

‘enough”

i

 

twol
major topics: 1) ”that our voting
power should be used carefully
and intelligently, and 2) that

tributes must begin and take!
hold among the members of]
small communities like Grinnell
before they can become attri-‘
butes of government policy
makers in our large national
community.

To use a dining room analogy,
I believe that we students dl'ei
strong and intelligent enough to"
digest and profit by the “meat”;
even though we don’t care for‘
the "gravy" that is served along
with it. However, when that
“gravy" is the same old, moldy,
tasteless, and uninspired stuff
we have been served many times‘
it 1) makes themeathlghlyunri
palatable and 2) turns
people completely away from
even discovering that

Oskamp was graduated with
honors from Grinnell last year
where he earned an A. B. (1.2,
in psychology. He was n

 

underneath when the gravy is

scraped off.

To be more clear: this “gravy"i
which we students get alungl
with the meat of Dr Stevens'
speech is, as I see it, merely
another verbal attempt to brow-

.Leii‘ers “i0.—

an attempt to inspire us to en-,
ergize ourselves and our efforts
to change all this "wrong," ‘

The goal of inspiring us
students is commendable; we need
it: However, repeatedly yelling
at, blaming. and verbally chastis—
ing a person is no way to bring
about aggressive, inspired, lnr
dependent. and constructive ac—
tion on the part of that person
(or groups of persons).

Dr. Stevens seems to me to'
have ignored the following in
his speech. ,

1. The method of treating
student apathy, disinterest, non-
cooperation, immorality, etc. by

many times in editorials andi

other speeches; it hasn't worked.

2. People, even students, are
inclined to react as they are rec
acted to. If the administration
constantly and consistently re»
acts to students on an adult-to-
adult basis, 1 believe the stud-
ents would react more consist-
ently as adults. It is lamentable
that in cases where a student is
treated as an adult he or she
takes advantage of that [rental
merit and reacts as a child. I

Howeveri, I believe the studentsi
and the administration must;
share the blame. There is notE
that honest intellectual outlookl
and stimulating atmosphere at
Grinnell that consistently, notl'
just sometimes, demands adult‘
behavior of everyone, freshmen}
through seniors.

I am‘ chagrined that I musti
cl‘ltlclze yet not be able to offer
constructive solutions. Small

Council) have been concernedi
about student aparthy, etc. for‘
some tune and have looked hard
for causes and solutions. I can give ,
neither. 1 can however, point toi
two conclusions which I have
reached concerning apathy, the
non—thinking student, and “ime
morality."

ll Verbal or written ﬂagel-
lation will not work, As the
gravy served up without intel-
lectual meat, it is quite likely,
after repeated servings, to spoil
our taste for meat of any kind.
This method of blaming, etc., is,
too often used by the administra-
tion and is merely treating the
symptoms of apathy, etc., rather
than. the causes-At best, this
passse between administration
and students.

2, I firmly believe that this
campus needs “inspiring”
that this inspiration must begin
at the top. with all the admins-
tration, and permeate downward.
At times, praising what is good
and ignoring what is bad can
inspire and encourage even
students to care more about
Grinnell and to try harder to
make it a better community.

s Dancing in thc

ark,

Friday, February 8. I952

by Bruce Cole

I always said this place was
a haven for draltrdodgers and
bad chock artists, A smart
cookie can stay here for the
duration of two wars (between
convictions. of course) and
never attain a junior standing.

Doc Sam‘s references to im—
morality On our pretty campus
just brushed atthe surface, and
very lightly, at that. I'm not
implying that he doesn’t know
What’s going on around here;
they don’t make ivory towers
that thick. isn't it strange how
few of us give a darn, though?

The guy who destroys the
most property is almost invar~
iably the most popular fellow

iin the dorm. Stealing is taboo,

if it's from your hall brothers.
If it’s from someone else‘s hall
brother ‘lt’s not stealing. if it’s
from the college. it’s revenge.

As for cheating, that word
has become synonymous with
success and ingenuity. College
exams train us for the kind of
polished skulduggel‘y that would
make Fagin blush with inader
quacy. I’m not blaming the
exam system, either.

I'm blaming the crooked,
scamy, degenerate kind of at-
titude I’ve been-able to develop,
along with my friends. If there
was ever a generation without
a conscience, we’re it. Other-
wise, how could we have filed
out of Darby gym yesterday, all
giggles, after just hearing the
straight dope about ourselves?

This is the college where
everyone screams about being
treated like a baby. This is also

ltlie college that can’t have 3

humor magazine because it
doesn't laugh at anything that
isn't dirty. I never bothered to
read Arena because someone
told me it was clean.

President Stevens ought to
know better than to try and
treat us as adults. I can think
of about ten mature students on
this campus and they’re all
pretty dull. Our values don’t
permit us to respect maturity in
anyone but Civil war veterans.

I heard all kinds of reactions
to yesterday’s convecation and
they were all cute. We’ve got
some real sharp wits around'
here: someone should install a
Palmolive Laffrmeter in every
dorm so that we could keep
score.

\‘Ve’re not going to make good
voters or anything else and
anyone who tries to alter that
situation is suffering from some
kind of delusions We are going
to have fun, though, even if it
kills us,

Last night's serenade was
a lifesaver. It takes
something like that to bring us
back to normal after a whole
day of thinking about our-
selves, I heard a few girls say
they nearly cried. That sounds
too prehistoric to believe.

I shall close with apologies to
our President, poor discouraged
soul that he must be. Don't give
up, old Warrior!

‘Eldridge Visits

Frances Eldridge, chairman of
the English department of Rock—
ford (Ill) college, will visit the
Grinnell faculty Tuesday and
Wednesday, to gain information
on student writing quality, and
the problems of teaching writ—
ing to students of Grinncll.

Dr. Eldridge is making a tour
of approximately loo schools in
the United States. She will YE-
port to- the Ford foundation,
which is flnanclng her tour, and
the findings will probably be
publlshed by the foundation.

Arriving at Grinnell from the
University of Iowa, Dr. Eldr

City, Mo.

John Kleinschmidt‘, who was
on leave from Grinnell, was
also being sponsored by that
Ford foundation to discover
problems faced in other schools
in teaching foreign languages.
