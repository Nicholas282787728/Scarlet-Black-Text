Review

by Ben Jones

”The Old Maid and the Thief,”
first production of Grinnell's
newly conceived Opera works
shop, is, if not a landmark in
_the history of opera, at least an
levent of real significance on .the
lCi-innell campus.

The combined effort of Messrs,

marks a new direction for both
the drama and music depart-
ments The production last night
in ARH auditorium suggests that
their partnership may lead to a
revival of culture at Grinnell.

The Menotti opera was a good
choice. Appealing in its comedy
and in its directness of expres-
sion, the opera is both exciting
and entertaining One gets the
feeling that Menotti has some.
thing to say about American
culture 7 about the boredom
of smalletown life, the everlaste
ing search for a thrill,

But the excitement ol the pro
duction rests in the way Menotti
integrates a moving musical line
with a Sharp libretto (that’s the
words), Sometimes mock—serious,
sometimes slapstick, the per.
formance more often has in the
area of good comic wit.

The small cast reveals that
Grinnell students are capable of
good acting, good musicianship,

maid, has good feeling for the
part of a young girl seeking
