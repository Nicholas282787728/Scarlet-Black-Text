Sticks
and
Stones

By Paul Bass

The women of Grinnell have
elected their new house presi—
dents, and it now remains for
the men to elect theirs. I sup-
pose everyone has had just
about enough of elections by
this time, but I should still like
to say a few words in that re
gard.

That the women's presiden—
tial elections are attended by
a lot of silliness would be
difficult to deny; all that
stampeding up and down the
loggia, and all that flim-ﬂam
in the dining room, is hard-
ly elevating . . . and barely
amusing.

Even so, there is at least one
feature of the women’s election
which it might pay north cam,- .
pus to look at. Namely, the
election of Women not to the
presidency of a specific hall, but
only to the position itSeLf,
placement of the seven winners
occurring afterwards.

Now this does not assure
every women’s hall of getting
a house president that it wants.
But it does assure every hall of
receiving as its president, a
relative stranger, and, more-
over, a stranger whose abili-
ties the entire Quadrangle has
passed upon.

As a rule, 1 think the elec-
tion of anonymous oiticers by
vote of the mill) is a bad
thing. But, in the case of hall
presidents, I think it a good
system, a. system which north
campus might well adopt.
And for several reasons . . .

To ”begin With. an unfortun»
ate fact, some men’s halls are
perfectly devoid of alble, top-
notch junior men, while others
are blessed with a good number
of them. The former halls,

come election time, must Tues
fully vote for the lesser of‘ two

Screen Porch
To Be BuiH‘
On Lake Cabin

A screened-in porch costing
$700 is being built around the
cabin at Lake Acl'c. Thc stue
dent Council and CofHP pra-
vidcd $550 of the cost, and the
rest was donated by the college
in the form of labor.

The porch, which is 32' long
and 10‘ deep, is expected '10
be completed after spring
vacation. A new dock has also
bcen built. according to Tom
Bailey, on Campus social
chairman, and will be installr

ed as soon as the ice clears.
Bailey urged that groups

wanting parties this spring at
the cabin arrange with him now
fol' a date as weekend dates
are tilling rapidly.

In addition to the now porch
and dock, two picnic tables have
been added, and the picnic area
and fireplaces have been rc-

paired,

obvious evils. And the latter.
though they elect a good men
to office, are forced to relegate
equally good men to the posir
tions of secretary or intrar
mural chairman.

And, since the men’s hall
president is less leader than
policeman, I think it likely
that the less familiar he is
with the hall personnel, the
better the job he can do as
policeman.

The institution of such a we
tem (that is, the election of
nine presidents from the whole
of the junior class) would do
away with a lot of the pre—
election nastiness that takes
place in the halls, and would,
in the long run, improve the
quaity of the north campus cone
stebulary.

It would. in any event, give
some hope of redemption to
those halls which lack intellim
gent leaders. It isn't necessary,
to know every member of. al
hall intimately to police it cf-‘
