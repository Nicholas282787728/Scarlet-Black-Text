(3) “There is no arbitrary cut-
ting oi squads for lack of abllr
ity alone. Coaches advise ath~l
let'es individually to drop out ift
they teel the boys are wasting
their time. However, squads arc‘
ctit for disciplinary reasons.

(4) ‘Gl‘innell maintains a‘
freshman team in each Sport,‘
and the program of training fol»
lows the varsity pattern. Fresh;
men are coached by a regular
stait member, and have the\
same practice procedures, tl‘ain-[
ing rules. etc. Their schedule,‘
however. is reduced by c‘onfer-,
ence rule. t

(5) “Coaches at Grinnell do
not participate directly in ad-
missions or recruitment of stu-
dents. Their role in admissions
will be discussed later'in Sec-
tion V. , .

(6) ‘Grinnell generally fol~
lows the policy of playing “like
institutions" in all contests. This
means a predominantly confer
ence schedule with a few iion-
contercncc opponen Available
s, trbvel distance, and
pl‘OVlmlly oi interested fans are
factors governing schcdulcs.
Games are pl yed on weekends
and other datcs with a minimum
of cla- slime loss by athletes." l
Admissions Procedure: l

(1) “The coaches report names
and addresses of prospective
student athletes to the admis-
sions department. Those pros»
pectivc students are then hands
led through the regular adi‘nlsV
oioiis procedure. _

(2) “After admissions coun—
selors have interviewed prospeu
tivc student athletes, this fact is
reported to the coaching staff.
The appropriate staff member

i

then writes a personal Iollnw»tlp
letter in the sludent. His name is
also put on tho Coachcs' SmeSA
letter hat, winch means he will
receive tlic copiesof the letter
throughout the remainder of the
school year.

(3) "The coaches are always
on call on campus to consult
w th prospective students These
visits, however, are arranged by
the admissions department,”

Public helations: Events spon-
sored by the department include:
n state high school basketball
coaches clinic in November, and
the Griiiiiell Interscholastic track
and tennis meets, as well as tho
state high school tennis meet,

The coaching staff also writes
a iii—weekly review of current
athletic activities. This is known
as the Gl'lnnell “Sportsletter”
and is availabte to alumni, par-
cnts, friends and prospective
athletes Slatt members are also
avail-ole Lo spcak at highschool,
alumni and sports banquets.

Iicsiilts "The following are
some 'evidcnces of the success of
the Giiiiiiell program:

(1) "Scholarship of athletes;

Grinnell athletes achieve grade
averages higher than their non-
atlilete counterparts.~In a pre-
vious study, Gi-iniiell athletes

t2) “Attrition rate among
athletes is less than that of non-
atiilctcs, In fact, there is hardly
any attrition among varsity ath-
lctcs, though there is some at
the Irerhman level.

/ ,
(3) “In 1957.2, 32.8 percent of
all eligible nicn participated in
varsity sports and 60.6 percent
of all eligible men participated
in Ireshman sports These
are exlI'clIlcly nigh percentages
even when compared with those
of like lnstituLtonS. They are
tantasttcaily high when compai
ed with those of large univeisi—
ties where only a tiny minority
of men can he a part of inter-
collegiate athletics, .

(4) “VVineLoss Record: . . . We
stand high in the overall rating,
We are Weak in football; and
this has been true through the,
years: A discussion of the prob—
lem involved is found in the last
section of this paper.
