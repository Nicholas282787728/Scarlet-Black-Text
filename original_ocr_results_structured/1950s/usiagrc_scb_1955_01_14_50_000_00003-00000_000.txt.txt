SCARLET AND BLACK

C of HP Seeks Boe Arranges Bldg. and Grounds

Sponsor Plan

In their meeting this week
the c of HP intensified their ef—

forts to inaugurate a policy of
faculty sponsors for each men’s
dormitory. This program would
supplant the chaperone system
now in existence,

Under the faculty sponsor
system, two faculty members
would be designated as official
chaperones for a particular hall.
They would be present at hall
functions including the proposed
bi-weekly open house,

Explain Plan

I: of HP president Dave Fer-
guson explained that under the
present system some faculty
members are called upon to be
chaperoi-ies every week, Further,
he said, there is no incentive
for the members of the hall to
cultivate any acquaintance with
these sponsors since they are
there for one night only.

Ferguson said that both these
drawbacks would 'be done away
with by the sponsor system.

As it is set up at present,
each hall would have two
spousal-s each serving two
years. The two year terms
would expire on alternate
years. This would mean that
mere would always be at
lust one sponsor with a full
year's experience.

In accordance with this plan,
,the c of HP has contacted sev-
eral faculty members, and a
committee headed ,by Dave
Norris will personally contact
the rest.
