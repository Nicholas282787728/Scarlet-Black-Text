Student Action

The faculty’s decision to experiment with four hour
courses next year is another step contributing'to greater
student responsibility. Next year it Will be posmble to con—
centrate on fewer courses and yet fulfill the regular
amount of semester hour requirements. Opportunity for de-
veloping a more mature outlook on college work has in-
creased this-year with such things-as unlimited cuts and
proposal for an honol~ system.

But we wonder what has actually happened 'to plans
for a student honor system. Last semester’s actiVltles and
discussions for such a system seem to have been forgotten.
.The administration and faculty have made all the progres—
sive changes this semester, but\,_thus far, every student

planned change has either been bogged down with disagree-

ment, or forgotten

I’m not sure how many of you
were aware 01 that fact, but it
is obvious that students are
painfully uninformed regarding
student government. They have
some vague ideas on the matter,
but they just don’t know what
student government does for
them personally.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Far From

Customary
Skies

By Gene Thompson
One night this week, craving
a Ritz cracker, I entered the
room of one or the more disting-
ulshed members ct our hall, a
friend of mine named Peter
Meats.

He was reading some works
of Ar' totle when I came in, and
he didn’t even look up, but just
asked: ”\Vhat you want?”

“Wanna Ritz cracker," I said,
not wanting to bother him too
much. Peter is a history ma-
jor in his junior year, and has
a lot of work to do.

“Sure is quiet out tonight," I
said, not expecting him to an.
swer. Peter has an 1. Q. of two
hundred and seven. and at that
moment it ws all‘iocused on
Aristotle,

But he laid down his book and
said: “ch, it is quiet. Things
are sure different than they
were when i was a freshman.
Wanna hear about it?"

of course I did. i lmcw he was
about to tell rnc again of his
favorite part of Grinnell's his-
tory—the Dean Brown regime. I
sat quietly listening ' while I
heard all the old, but still [as—
cinating stories that are a part
of the legend oi Hank Brown.

I thrilled to mics or crepe-
soled shoes, over-stuficd turni-
Lure burning on Mac iicld,
mining barricades on rariJ
Street—the whole story. They

were tales of bygone days, it ~

gloriously violent en in Grim
uell history, Peter breathed a
nostalgic sigh as each story
was told, and I got tears in my
eyes when I heard of one par-
ﬁculzrly heart-warning cpl-
sode—the' time that Hank
risked his life to ride ahead
and warn South Campus 01 the
gathering mob.

Peter then began, as 'he al-
ways does, to contrast those days
withﬂhe present: “It used to be
that it you were even caught.
mumblng ”Hey Nectar' absent-
mindedly tc' ycurselt you were
filled ior it It was the name of
a past houselnother of Dibble
hall, believe it or not, and it was
a call to battle when they heard
it. Now Dibble hall just gets in
trouble with Colonel Summers
for playing music during drill
periods, and ‘Hey, Nectar' just
doesn't mean what it used to.
In those clays, a riot was a
many-splendoured thing — now,
they are just childish, hali-heart~
ed attempts that _never quite
come 0H. and everyone forgets
about them the next day." _

Peter was getting emotional:

“he never seen anything like

and policy! A fifteelhminute
