Lawrence Downs

Last Saturday Grinnell's Pioa
neers dropped their second
straight Mldwest conference
game to Lawrence 34-13 before
a. capacity Parents Day crowd.
The Scarlet and Black griddel‘s
held a 1346 halftime edge but
fell apart before the heavier
Vikings in the last stanza.

At the present the Pioneers
are in the loop cellar with a
two loss, one tie record and
are the only team without a
victory to their credit. The vic—
tory gave Lawrence a 3-1 mark
to move them into second place
behind undefeated Carleton.

Grinnell drew first blood
when Pandler Sandler skirted
end for three yards and the
TD, climaxing‘ an 84 yard drive
after thc opening kickoff.

Midway in the second period
Roger Stiles drove through the
middle of the Pioneer Line for
nine yards to tie the game at
6-6, With only 12 seconds left
in the half Paul Jones plunged
from the one foot line for Grins
nell’sv last score. Dick von
Maur’s kick gave the Scarlets
their halftime margin.

After the intermission the
two teams battled until near
the end of the period when
stiles again scored, this time
from the one. The conversion
was good and the contest was

The roof fell in on the Pin-
neers during this period as
Lawrence salted the game with
three more six pointers. Highs
light of the onslaught was a
72—yard punt return by John
Gundlach. it was obvious that
the superior weight of the Vl'k-
ing forwards was wearing down
their smaller opponents. The
Pioneers gave away almost 15
potmds per man and just
couldn‘t keep up the terrific
pace.

Eroshﬁfoolball‘ Team Ready forWCoe' 7

Coach E G. Booth‘s tresnin-ni
football contingent will get its
first taste of competition tomor-
row as the squad battles COS:
college on Ward field.

The Kohawk ii-osh should be
better than the team that lost
to Grinnell last year 1970, The
junlor Pioneers are untested, and
little can be told about them at
this date.

Coach Booth has named his
starters for tomorrow. The
tentative lineup is as follows:
left end, Ernie Rickett; left

tackle Jerry Kurth; left guard,

SCARLET .AND BLACK

Pioneers

G‘rinneii was also hindered lay

the loss of regular center Tom
Boc at the start of the second
half, Boe suffered a recurrence
of an old back injury but it
was not serious.

The Pioneer eleven was also
handicapped by the inability to
capitalize on their scoring op
portunities. Three times during
the first half the Pioneers had
the ball within the Viking ten
and couldn’t push it over, In
fact it took four plays to score
from the two on the second
touchdown.

Chuck Adams; center, Mike
Goodrich; right guard, stan Jens
son; ght tackle, Bob Carothers;
and right end, Bill Moores.

The starting backfield includes
Harry Harper at quarterback,
right half Skip Keenan, left
half, Jack Schaifer, and full—
back Gary Paschal.

Extra Points

It seems that everyone’s trying to get into the act on the
Midwest conference grid scene. Last week, even lowly Ripon
dazzled, with a 14-12 upset over Coe. Coc had previously tip.
ped Grinnell 52.0 and lost to Lawrence 21-20.

“‘5 Grinnell’s turn to tackle the Kipon Redmen tomor—
row, and this time, it’s Grinnell’s turn for a victory. Ripon
can hardly be expected to maintain the fighting edge they
held last week. in the words of Coach Pfitsch, “We're going

up there to win our first ball game." Look for Grlnueu by

a 20-13 score.

—L8H‘y Sehalezer

Injuries have hurt the team for the Ripon game. Al
pfaender has been bothered by headaches, the after—effects of
an early season concussion, and may not be ready for Carleton
at Homecoming. Tom Boe has back trouble but may see limited

action tomorrow.

“IT’S

to taste better!

Doubtless, you’ve guessed that the Droodle
at the right is: Careless two-gull cowboy

enjoying better-tasting

Lucky while yvait-

ing in ambush. Lots of other two-gun cows
boys—and many millions of no-gun folks—
agree that Luckies taste better. Students,
for example, prefer Luckies to all other
brands, according to the latest, biggest
coast-inacoasl, college survey. Once again,
the No. 1 reason is that Luckies taste
better. They taste better because Lucky
Strike is the cigarette of ﬁne tobacco . . .

and “It’s Toasted” to
