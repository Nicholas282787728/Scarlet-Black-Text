most the entire team, Grinnell
won its first game of the seas
son, 10-4, over Cornell.

Cornell j mood to a 2-0 lead
in the first inning, but from
then on, Grinnell dominated
the game, collecting six hits
and stealing a total of ten
hases. Burl itoegge was the
leading Pioneer batter, gath—
cring three hits in six times at
bat. Jim rfannenstiel, nick
Crowi and Gordy Loucks ace
counted for Grinnell‘s other
three hits.
0n rriday the Knox Siwash,
on the strength of greater hit-
ting power took a lead from the
Pioneers at the end of seven in—
nings, and from then on were
never headed. Cold weather and
three hours and 45 minutes of
baseball, told on both teams, es-
peeially the pitchers.

Crush, R am 8—Schalager Wins Open Mile Al Cornell;

Pioneers Grab 2nd |n_Pe|la Triangular

A brilliant victory by
Larry Schaleger in the open
mile run crowned an unim-
pressive performance by/ the
val'Slty track squad at the
Cornell relays last Saturday.

Sellaleger quickly followed up
this performance by winning
both the one-mile and two-mile

events at a triangular meet with
Central and Simpson colleges at
Fella on Tuesday.

Grinnell’s relay teams took a
variety of thirds, fourths, and
fifths in various events at Cor-
nell. Sam Petroff was second in
the iavelin, Bob Mchrnsey third
in the high jump, and George
Mchmsey fourth in the long
Jump. The tw0rmlle relay team
of which most of the squad’s
hopes were based was disap-
pointingly fifth in this event.

It was Scliaieger, however,
who added lustre to the team’s
performance with his mile vic-
tory, starting in a field coni-
posod or some, of the best
small college milers in the
midwest, among which were
Earl Neil of Carleton, last
year’s Midwest conierence
champion, Conway oi Iowa
state Teachers, and Harvey of

Duhuquc university, “Schnl”
was placed dccp in the bunch
for the first two laps and ap-
peared to he pacing himseli
comfortably.

As the field, now slightly
strung out, passed the halfway
mark, schaleger running easily,
moved with short, quick bursts
into fourth position as the pace
quickened along the backstretchi

With 400 yards to go, ,the
Grinnell miler passed Harvey in
a sudden powerful spurt and
moving with a long, quick stride,
drew level and passed a dying
Neil along the backstreteh, It
still seemed as if Conway was
too far ahead to catch with an
easy in yards lead, but Schale-
ger gaining speed with every
stride closed the gap rapidly,
taking a dying .Conway in the
last stretch and bursting the
tape for his best time, a min.

In the triangular meet at Pella
against Central and Simpson on
Tuesday, Central scored 80
points to defeat Grinnell with 57
and Simpson with 23. Winners
for Grinnell were Schaleger in
the mile and twormile, Mchm—
sey in the broad jump and Pet—
roff in the discus and javelin. [In
the half—mile, Heimstra of Cen-
,tral hit the tape a stride ahead
' of Bacchus of Grinnell, lboth run<
ners bettering the old record of
2203.3, while a closely contested
milerrelay was won by Central.

Dwight Nissen and Lee Moses
shared the pitching chores for
the Pioneers, and also collected
five of Grinnelrs fifteen hits.
Crowl and Roegge accounted for
two apiece, and Nissen one,

Armin Scharfe, with four
hits and five runs batted in, and

aul Kantzler, with three hits,
were Grinnelrs leading batsmen.

1n the Monmouth affair on
Saturday both Crowl of the
Pioneers and soot hurler Dol-
linger turned in outstanding
pitching performances, giving
up six and five hits apiece,
respectively, but Monmouth,
capitalizing on three runs in
the fifth inning, and one in
the seventh, shutsout the Pin-
neers, 44!.

Coach John Pfitsch feels that
“the team is doing a fine job,
but they lack experience. They
still make mistakes, but there
will be less of these as the sea-
son goes on." Pfitsch also stated
that he is very pleased with the
student response, and hopes that
it will continue.
