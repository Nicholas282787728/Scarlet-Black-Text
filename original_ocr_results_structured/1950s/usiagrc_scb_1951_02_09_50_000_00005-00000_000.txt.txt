Coe has made the road visits
of the Grinnell five difficult in
past seasons Two years ago,
Coe won in an upset, and last
year, they went down in defeat
only after playing a close game
all the way, with ~the final

game tonight becomes a vital en.
counter in the schedule of the

An indignant student slam—
med down a hook on the coun- ‘
ter in the book store.

“What's the idea of giving
me this book for my English
course," he wanted to know.
”Why, it’s not even written in
English!”

The clerk picked up the hook
and read the title—“Chaucer’s
Canterbury Tales."
