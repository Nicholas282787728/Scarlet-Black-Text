in a milieu of active campus
discussions concerning the over.
whelming work load and the
search for more independent
student work and thought, the
Grinnell English department has
presented the details on the new
English major. it is the product
of several months’ planning?
the collective result of a deep
background in literature. As it
tentatively functions, it will ef-
fect both an increase in the
work load for the English ma.
jors and a long—awaited increase
in, student responsibility in the
major field.

As before, an English major
may study specifically in Eng.
lish literature, English-Ameri-
can literature, or English-jour-
nalism. Regardleslof ﬁeld, he
must take three comprehen—
sive examinations at the end
oi his senior year.

To prepare for his camp, the
English major is presented with
an extensive reading list which
outlines the works related to
speciﬁc areas of English meme
tune from which he must select
three for his examination topics.
One of the three exams must
treat literature written in Eng.
lish after 1900.

After he has made his selec-
tion, the student begins, through
courses and independent work,
to cover the required material,

The reading lists that the de-
partment has compiled are ex-
cellent. Lists have been made
for eight periods of English lit-
erature, American literature be
fore 1000 and literature written
in English after lguo. Each list
covers a single examination area
and is divided into required
texts, optional texts and second-
ary works.

in his ﬁelds of choice, the
student will be responsible
for the required texts whether
they are covered in classes or

not. He will then plan to
study additional items to de-
velop specific interests or to
increase his comprehension of
the entire area.

A single example will suggest
the nature of the lists. All slur
dents are required to take a test
in English and American litera«

cture since 1900. The required
reading in preparation for the
test includes 79 poems from the
following poets: Yeats. Frost,
Stevens, William Carlos Wil-
liams, Pound, Moore, cummings,
Auden and Dylan Thomas; 25
works of fiction including 12
novels from James, Conrad,
Dreiser, stein, Cather, Joyce,
Woolf, Lawrence, Lewis, Dos
passos, Fitzgerald, Faulkner and
Hemingway; three contemporary
novels selected from a choice oil
10; nine plays from Shaw, Yeats,
O’Casey, Eliot, O’Neill, Tennes-
see Williams and Miller; an au-‘
tohiography from Adams and
Yeats and seven works in liter—
. ary criticism from James, Eliot,i
Richards, Wilson, Burke and‘
Blackmur. The list includes sup<l
plementary texts in all these,
areas. l

An opportunity to hear

it vivid, personal account of

Grinnell college life in the “old days" was recently afforded
a Scarlet and Black reporter. Mrs. Frank Herriott, class of
1390, while visiting in Grimell was able to give a lively
picture of Just what our campus was like when she attended

college here.

The Tracks

To begin with, an item in ret-
rospect. The Women’s dance
intramural was a smashing suc-
cess despite a cat on the stage
and the minor errors which al—
ways occur. The judges, I be—
lieve, had a difficult job in
choosing a winner . . . but Loose
came out on top. The winning
theme was “Fourth for Bridge."
Read was in second place, Main
was third, and Mears fourth.

A movie will be featured to-
night at 8 p.m. and Sunday at
1:30. It is “Dirty Hands"
written by lean-ram Sartre, a
French flick with English sub-
titles.

Also tonight, the senior class
will journey to the Amanas for
a dinner party. Tomorrow
night the last of the men’s
housepartics will be held. For
those not attending the parties,
there will be free dancing in
the Union.

On December 2, the Scarlet
and Black masthead will have
dinner at Marchellixlo’s.

It seems strange to be talk-
ing of Christmas at this date
but next Week the lestivities
begin. On December 4, ﬁle_
Y. W. C. A. tea fat faculty
women will be held in Loose
launge between the hours-of 4
and 5:30. December 5, folluw-
ing the basketball game, there
will be a “Faidﬂl Flint" ill
the Union All holidays will
be celebrated and there will
be refreshments and {tea danc-
Ins.

Men’s open houses will fol-
low the Dec. 5 game.

On December lo in Darby
gymnasium, a special concert of
Christmas carols will be pre-
sented. Community and college
are invited to attend. Four col-
lege groups, the choir, the men’s
glee club, the Women’s glee club,
and a brass choir will be fea-
tured. Elbert Smith will give
a half-hour carol recital on the
carillonic bells before the con-

Mi-s. Herriott, a small, slight
woman with snowewhile hair,
chuckled softly, “Things cer-
tainly have changed!” She went
on to explain that when she
went to college there were only

classrooms, no dorms. The cam-
pus in 1888 consisted of ape
proximately 300 students; her
senior graduating class had 26
members.

When questioned about rc-
quirements for entering Grin-
nell in those days, she replied
that Grinncll had an academy
Willa equivalent of a modern
prep school. In this academy
students were taught Latin
and Greek and the require-
ments for entrance was three
or four years of Latin and two
years of Greek.

Everyone lived in town. "In
fact,” she stated, “that’s why
there are so many huge homes
in Grinnell. Many of them were
built Will‘l the intention of rent-
ing out rooms to the college
students." In 1888 it cost a Stu»
dent approximately $4 per week
for room and board. Some stu-
dents boarded in private homes
and ate their meals in a house
on 5th and High street which
served students three meals a
day. seven days a week for
about $1.75 a week.

Naturally, because there
were no dorms and all the
students lived off campus,
there was no social life organ-
ized by the school as there is
today. “But,“ Mrs. Herriott
said, with a twinkle in her
eye, “we still managed to
have a good time!"

When she attended Grinnell
the tuition was $31 for three
sessionsifall, winter and spring.
As nearly as she could remem-
ber, professors received $1,200 a
year and the president of the
college about $2,000.

And what did she study? r
Among other things, Greek,
Latin, mathematics and Eng-
lish. According to Mrs, Her-
riott, the study plan of her
time was much different from -
ours. Though there was a li
brary on campus, few people
ever found occasion to use it.
Courses consisted of reading
material and learning it
thoroughly. It was felt by the
professors that a student was

in no position to criticize the
material read—obviously the
authors knew what they were
talking about! She recalled
that in her philosophy course
she studied “Paradise Lost"
and memorized the whole
thing. She can recall parts of
it today.

Educational policies w e r e
changing‘even in her day. One
of the amusing incidents she re-
called was in connection with
the above-mentioned philosophy
course. For three years the
classes had been studying such
materials as Butler’s “Analogy”,
Haven's ”Moral Philosophy” and
Mark Hopkins’ “Evidences of
Christianity.” Then in her last
year at Grinnell, with the in»
auguration of President Gates, a
new book was required in the
philosophy course, "Evolution
and Its Relation to Religious
Thought." In 1890 this was pro-
gressive education!

' THROUGH OUR

In her class of 26 members,
about is were men. Majors
were primarily in law and
theology. Mrs. Herriott's hus-
band, also a member of the
class of 1890, did graduate
study at John‘s Hopkins uni-
versity. “Even then," she
stated, “a Grinnell education
made you eligible for graduate
work in the established East-
ern universities."lvks. Herriott
did a year’s graduate work at
Bryn Mawr after leaving
Grinnell. Then she returned
and taught Greek and Latin in
the academy.

Although many changes in
college education have been
wrought since 1390, the educa-
tional ideals of Mrs. Herriott’s
family coincide with contem-
porary ones: all six children in
her family attended college. It
was her parents idea that
“every one of their children
should have a college education."
