The Gl‘i nell football team
will entertain Knox here to
niorrow at 2 pm. before it
Homecoming crond expected
to fill Ward stadium. Both
teams have identical 1-3 rec-
ords and the contest is pre—
dicted to be a toss-up, with
il'el'ther team having a notice-
alile edge.

its season opener, then tell he—

in that order, in a similar pats
tern, Grinnell defeated Lawr
rtzlico and then was downed by
Ripon. Carleton and Cornell.
Therefore it appears that both
squads will be eager to get on
the winning trail again.

Knox’s large and rugged
line is probably its biggest
asset. The Siwash also ieature
excellent defensive halitiacks,
who could keep the Pioneers’
air attack dcmoliilized. In addis
tion, Knox fields a team which
is large at all positions,

One»hundrcdrand~nlnely-pound
halfbacks Mike Morin and Jun-
ior Brown and fullback Bob
Lombardi furnish Knox’s run-
ning power, while quarterback
Mike Kolling provides the pass-
ing. Kolling's, favorite
is end Lanny Kiest, who leads
Knox in pass catching Co-cap-
tains Jack Slallard and Dick
Olson are Knox’s top linemen.

Co-captain John Copeland, 145'
pound senior from Keokuk, is
the “big man" in Grinnelrs of-
fensive attack. Last season
Copeland compiled 1042 yards

Team Consistency
Overlakes Cornell

The Pioneer hart-let's
squeezed out a 26731 victory
over 21 powerful Cornell
squad last Saturday at Mt.
Vernon.

Only :1 week before the
Cornell coach stated in the
school paper that he thought
the Rams would take the
first two places but‘ ”Grin—
nell's down the line strength
could hurt us.“ Saturday proved
him exiictly right as Homer
Latimel‘ and Ron Campbell
notched the ﬁrst two places for
Cornell. it was, though, the
the line strength that
beat Cornellachuck Yoak took
third renewed by Louis Sachs.
Art Kisser, Grant Fairbanks,
and Fred Boughcy who took
lourth, fifth, sixth and eighth
respectively. The other five
Grinncllialls finished in front of
Cornell's filth man which push-
cd him down tar enough in the
scoring to give Gi-innell the
victory.

Tomorrow the harriers will be
seeking their sixth straight
dual meet victory when they
meet Knox. Knox is fortified
by two returning lettermen hut
they aren't expected to give the
Pioneers a scare equal to the
one they received last Saturday
