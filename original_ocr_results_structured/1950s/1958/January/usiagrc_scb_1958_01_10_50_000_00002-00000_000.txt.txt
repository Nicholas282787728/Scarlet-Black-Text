No Mustard- Cutter, This

The Student Council, Thursday evening, in its tradi-
tional fashion, mounted its trusty steed and rode off in all
directions, and to compound the disaster, forgot even to

saddle up first.

Had the council been firmly seated in a background of
adequate information, something might have gotten done;
without this, the outcome was foredoomed to failure, In-
quiries concerning the venerable KGRW arose in the 433rd
consecutive meeting, it was stated that college radio had
been subsidized to the tune of almost $10,000 over the last
ten years, members donned sackcloth and ashes and lamented
how they had been sheared of all their wool except the por-
tion over their eyes, and went home hoping for the best.

No one knows yet if and when KGRW will begin con~
tinuous and worthwhile broadcasting. We think and hope
it will, and further hope that the inaction of student govern-
ment will not jeapordize an otherwise legitimate enterprise.

It seems that the only solution to present uncertainties
is a thorough investigation by a properly constituted and
empowered body, probably the Committee on Students Pub-
lications. Another appropriation will be called for in a few
weeks’ time, It cannot, and probably will not be forthcoming

unless the Student Council again begins to use its vote and
voice in that committee.

Next week will usher in a new era in student govern-
ment. Finding plebiscites and public opinion polls unsatis-
factory, council will now attempt to get the word from the
horse’s mouth by summoning the entire student body to
attend its next meeting to get “ideas” and perhaps, action
on social activities in the coming semester. If student gov-
ernment is going to abdicate its power and ability, if any, to
act, has little justification left.

President Bowen, in a recent address to an NSA con-
vention, suggested that student government will soon be
faced with problems which, due to increased work loads on
its members, it will be unable to solve. If so, the answer is
not to take out a license for criticism as this editorial does.
but instead to re-define the role of student government.

As one solution, President Bowen suggested the intro-
duction, into government, at the top level, of freshmen and
sophomores, who are not as academically burdened. This
may be part of the answer. But as things now stand, stu-
dent government just doesn’t seem to be able to cut the
mustard. We hope that the forthcoming student council
campaign, convention, and hall elections can and will pro-
duce the mustardtutters.

On Thursday night Cowles
Hall invited two English-fac-
Illty members and their wives
to dinner in the dining lull
and to a bull-SMon in the
clubkonm. We talked of edu-
cation, including such inter-
esting questions as what the
Grinnell student can do about
his dislikes of courses, cu
riclllIIln, and individual in-
structors.

The faculty members were
thoughtful, helpful, and ready
to listen, as most faculty mem-
bers usually are, if given a
chance. Their wives’ contribu-
tions were valuable, capable,
and very much welcome. Some
Cowles freshmen opened their
mouths in an assembly for the
first time this year, and reveaL
ed a promising degree of cap‘
ability. .

A volleyball game and a ‘very
interesting Student Council
meeting were forgotten during
our two hours of talk We dis-
covered thélt it was worthwhile,
and will be worthwhile doing
again.
