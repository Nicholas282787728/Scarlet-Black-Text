Berne Finds Siuclem‘ Musical

Nine “Guys and Dolls" crap-shooters come up out of the New
York sewer system for this picture. Kneeling are, from left, Joe
Nassif, Boll Weitzman and Tom Alter. Standing, from left, Peter
Parshall, Al Fisher, Bob Twitehell, George Novy, Jim Palmer and
Ron Henry.

(By Susan Berne)

The current college theater production is as brisk as
the track at Pimlico, as fresh as Mindy‘s cheesecake, and as
bright as Broadway itself, The first honest attempt in
recent years to pool talent from the departments of drama,
music, and dance makes “Guys and Dolls" an important mile-

stone in the Grinnell theater.

The show opens with a skill»
fully staged musical number in
which representatives from every
quarter of Runyon's world par~
ade before a very colorful back-
drop. Next, the first appear
ance of Nathan Detroit is pre—
pared for in conversation and
song, and then the fun really be—
gins. Joe Nassif as Nathan is the
man of the hour. ror every
moment that Joe is on the stage
there is an excitement genera-
ted which no other single per-
former quite matches. Using no
devices 'but his talent and a sen-
sible interpretation of his role,
Nassif‘s performance is a tri-
umph of personality more than
of dramatic or Vocal ability.

Carolyn Tilly, as Nassit's op-
FOSite number, is an extremely

appealing Adelaide. Most de-

lightful in the two night-club
scenes.with the chorus line
behind her, Till is another who
will capture the audience with
the power of her personality.

Her performance is somewhat
inconsistent, however, and I
think it is because she has sac-
rificed the best musical-com-
edy voice on campus in an ei-
fort to elucidate the character
of Adelaide.

Till has a wonderful full-bod-
ied voice which can operate in
a wide range but, by concentrat—
ing too much on an accent which
is‘ not essential, she restricts
herself. This does not mean,
however. that her performance
is not pleasing. she turns in a
very fine job, and anyway, she‘s
a lot prettier than Nassif!

In the romantic subplot, Joan
Herman and John Price make
an attractive couple on the
stage, but the peaks of ﬂleir
Performances do not coincide.
The contract between the slick
gambler and the innocent mis—
sionary is occasionally obscured
through an unbecoming gentil-
ity in John’s approach to his
role which, however, he begins

Jean is at her best in the pre-

sweetness of her voice, and
gives her a chance to demon—
