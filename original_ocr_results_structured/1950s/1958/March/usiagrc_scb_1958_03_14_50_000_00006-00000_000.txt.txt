With a temporary break in
the basketball schedule, the EM
spotlight falls on this Saturday’s
howling tournament. The bowl-
ing will begin at 1:15 and will
run continuously Lhroughout the
afternoon.

In addition to an eligibil-
ity change. there is another
change in team scoring. Each
hall will be represean by
ﬁve bowlers who will bowl
lhree games anlecel This total

of 15 games will constitute the
team score. In the past, the
team score was made up of
the best four out of five.

L a s t year’s tournament was
Won by Cowles with 2381 total
pins and an average of 153 per
game. Returning this year from
that championship team are
Bob Hurst and Tom Hodgson.

Smith was second with 2323
total pins and a 154 average.
Smith’s returnees are Bud
Hulse and Jerry McCullough.
Hulse was inst year’s individ.
uai champion with 523 total
pins and s 176 average, and
nurse was second with 527
tom pins and a 175 average.

rrhis year's bowlers will be
aiming at the all—time individual
reoords of 568 total pins for a
three-game series and a high
game of 230.

It is impossible to make a
calculated prediction in M
bowling at Grinnell, because
.very few of the bowlers have
addinite average. For this
reason and that of the rela-
tive inexperience of the bowl-
ers, the beam with the mast
“lucky breaks" will probably
emerge as the winner.

I am not attempting to de-
grade Gi-innell’s bowlers, but in
the past this has usually been
the _case. However, the 1M
bowling tourney offers, for the
spectator, a very enjoyable and
relaxing afternoon of intense
competition among the host
bowlers of Grinnell.

Here’s how 1M basketball
looks with one week of games

remaining.
