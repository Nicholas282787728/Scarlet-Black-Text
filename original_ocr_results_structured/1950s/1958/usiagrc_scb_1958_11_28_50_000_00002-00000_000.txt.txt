conference is the “Afro-Asian Block.”

Stewart. in charge of plan<
ning the convention on campus,
said that “the conference is one
oi the first steps in meeting the
challenge set forth by Dr.
Bowen in September at a spe-
cial convocation in Herrick
chapel”. President Howard E,
Bowen said at that time that
each college has the responsi-
bility of “interesting the Stu»
dents in international affairs
and in the people of other lands
and helping them to understand
these people and their relation-
ships.”

Bowen expressed hope that
the students at Grinnell would
“achieve a greater understand-
ing oi the problems of our
troubled World. and would be
able to catch a R“! vision of
their responsibility toward an
ultimate aim of world-wide
justice and peace."

Stewart said, “I hope that

the conference can reach the
magnitude of the Convocation
last year.” He was referring to
the three~day academic convo—
cation in October, 1957 at which
several outstanding lecturers
and artists were guests.

The conference is under the
national sponsorship of the
Collegiate Council of the
United Nations (C.C.U.N.).
This organization will obtain
one or more prominent speak-
ers for the conference. Stewart
stressed that these speakers
will not only lecture to the
students but will also take
part in Coffee hours and infor-
mal discussions with them.
“The greatest goal of the con-
vention," said Stewart, “is to
get great student participation in
the conference. The more stu-
dents, the bigger success it Will
be,”

“To do this", he added, “we

To the Editor:

After transferring from the
University of Illinois, I expected
to find, in addition to greater
ability to absorb, retain and as-
sociate facts, a greater aware-
ness of ultimate goals and 'Obll-

it seems, however, that at
Grinnell, colicgo is considered
a men means to a higher
income bracket and to secure a
social niche. I tlnd it non-ex-
istent that a student will re-
alize that possessing superior
mentality and attending one

To the Editor!

Recently the noon announce—
ments reported that college
church will resume its previous
time of 11:30 am, while Sun-
day dinner will continue to be
served at 1:00 pm. On the basis
of a trial period. this decision
was reached for the convenience
of students who wanted a longer
Sunday afternoon.

A conflict with these new
hours aitccts about 75 stu-
dents who work as waiters
and waitresses in both Cowles
and the Quad. They are re-
quired to oat an early mcal
45 minutes before the regular
meal, at 12:15 on Sunday. Col-
lege church at tho present
time is usually over at 12:30,.
making it impossible tor em-
ployees to attcnd.

Town churches, most of whose
scrviccs begin at 11:00, prove in-
convenient for two reasons. It is
dltiicult to be back in time for
early dinner without rushing or
leaving before the service is
over. Secondly, waitresses are
required to wear certain clothes
to work which are not appro—
priate for church,

it has been suggested that
the employees mcai he served
alter the regular meal This
was not favorable at the time
because Sunday night supper
is served at 5:00 pm Employ-
ccs working hoth meals would
then have to eat dinner at
2:15 or 2:30 and suppcr at 4:30.

i wonder if the hour for cola
lege church could be reconsid-
ered in the light of this conflict
and perhaps moved up to 11:00
again.
