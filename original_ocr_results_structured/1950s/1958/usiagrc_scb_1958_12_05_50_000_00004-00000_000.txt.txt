’ Slicksond Shines

By Paul Haas

g ‘ At last Monday’s housemectiiig I was handed a questionnaire
pertaining 'to “the use made oi the Union, and to the attiude 0[
students toward the picsciit Sclup‘." i spent better than an hour
filling the thing out; spine of the questions’werc quite intelligent,‘
and tor a short time i thought that some good might actually come
of the survey But the total eiiect of the quoslionnairciand of
the Union committee's naive outlook—was siitiply pathetic, The
Union committee, like children believing in Santa Claus, believes
that something will be done to makerthe Union more habitable.

The administration, kiddies
doesn’t care. Thc administration
likes the Union Just the way it
is . . . sordid, ugly, and free oi
places where naughty boys and
'girls can be alone together. The
Union, in theory a refuge for
the bored, the dcprcssed and the
'horny, is in reality a sombre
bastion of chastity: great pains
have been taken to insure this
and the administration has SPalr
ed no expense in making the
building thoro’ughly unappealing,
thoroughly sterile, Allow inc to

The hl'ﬁ room, the only cu-
bicle readily available to every
student. and the only one with

the lot. The decor is antiseptic:

maiden is going to lose her head
in public._The Union, dear Union
committee, is the ﬁnal product
of the administration's moral
legislation.

The building would bc much
improved, of course, by a little
judicious spending; it doesn't
have to be depressing to be
chaste, and a {CW' prints on the
walls would hardly contribute
to a decline in morals. Nor
_would sling chairs and goose,

, neck lamps necessarily lung to

thewinds the virginity oi Grins
ncll womanhood. My inclination-
is to sympathize with the Union
committee and lament the fact
that there is no money available
with which to make any chang-
cs. But the committee itself. in
its present course of action, is
doing nothing at all to alleviate
the situation (that is, to make
the Union look less like the
reptile house at a 'third-rale
zoo). '

Rather, the Union committee
is considering the installation
of a bumper pool table and
some more ping pong tables
and maybe even “a private card
room," Isn’t that nice? Nothing
like a little game or bumper
pool to ease those libidinous
tension'sl Pool, ping pong, and
bridge . . . I think it’s awfully
nice. And as wholesome as hots
dogs or watermelon.

But the Union committee (bent
on bringing us more and more
regimented ‘boredoml' and the
administration (dedicated to the
preservation of chastity) have
failed to understand that while
immorality‘ can be legislated
against, it cannot be suppressed.

a dll‘fcrent result: we have the
nightly spawning on Main steps,

My sympathy is entirely andy
wholeheartedly ,with the folk
who sare iorced to show then

is a bit ovcrpo cring at times,
but there is simply nothing to
be done about it. Nothing, that‘
is, until the college stops as.:

Union comniittce and adminis-
tration «alike are contributing
only to a general animallzing
of perfectly normal human acts
and emotions.

The solution, I assure you,‘ is
not bumper pool.

To the Faculty:

I feel it is my duty to point
out that all this extra work
you've been giving its students
is putting us in air impossible
position. To go evenfui-lheigniiy
work you give Llsspuls us in an
impossible position, for we can
never finish it.:Thc argument
iollou given a certain amount
of woi , beiorc the student can
tinish it, he must first do half
01 it. Then he must do half or
what remains. Then halt oi what
still remains and so on ad infini-
tum. Thus the student \Vlll never
be able to finish. his, work. Yet
you, the Iaculty, expect him
to! No wonder so many of us
are dropping out, No wonder
so many of us wanted extend
ed Thanksgiving vacation. I
hereby issue a solemn warning
to the fliculty' 11 you persist in
giving us work, Griilllell Col-
lege Will soon be forced to close
down for lack of students.

. A Glance At lite Neit‘Freedtlm

Two weeks zlgtl the faculty seemed to lie hulking 21 pro-
g'l'esslvc move ill the libel ,limeil‘t 01' the required tut) hmll'
e. ‘ ili each course per semester. Probably mtlny of the
professors still think they have taken a great step l'orlt'zll'd.
lrlezllly the‘ have, but certain professors have taken the.
liberty of interpreting: the measure to mean that they can
give unannouliced 50 minute “quiz 5.”

We believe that these “drllp liotlrlys” are not. ill the
:pirét of the faculty legislation and are, ill fact, antithetical
c l . .

As we understand it, the move was taken to circumvent
the rigidity of the course, to get away from day-in” tlny~
out assignments, to give the student the opportunity to
wpl'k independently.

"Drop hourlys” don't.quite fill the bill. "
_ Being‘on the subject of “quizzes," liotli-lys and the
like, we would like to breach the idea of Ol'ﬂl‘ yamin‘ationsi

lf we are correct in assuming the prime reason for
lhe abolishing of the requirement was to escape the rigid-
ity of the cour§e, the private ”oral” would satisfy this end
and yet provide the student with a comprehensive test 01'
his knowledge and lliidel tanding of the material. '

The number of “orzlls” could be determined by the pro:

lessor-s and the student could take them when he felt he

was fully prepared:
This system, of course, would necessitate a dedicated

. faculty and an even more dedicated student body. Perhaps ‘

the facult

y does not think that these exist. We don’t
