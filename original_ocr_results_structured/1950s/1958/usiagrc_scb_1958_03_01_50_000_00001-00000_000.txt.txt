Jag Traclll'lon
Adds Humor
.
To Campaigns
By
Ever since conventions
came into being, “jags”
entered into the picture to
disrupt the serious parliaa
nientary procedures and to

add humor and color to our
political campaigns.

1943 found "Billk" Barnes,
entering into the race as a
serious candldale, but on the
morning of ﬁle election it was
discovered by the registrar’s
office that he lacked one hour
of credit to be on the eligibility
list. This was probably th
original, "Jag" candidate in that
no doubt “Bink” and his budr
dies Just kept laughing all
through the election.

The war years roiuid Ger-
man bands, circus bands,
twentyrfoot portraits or candir
dates, campaign slogans such
as “Blossom Out With Betty
Budd," and lots of women all
over’ campus.

A luscious Soiithcrn bcllc
dubbed “Scarlett O'Toolc,’. csr
corted by the Younkcr men in
the gray civil War uniiorms,
gave me dripping with honey
and magnolias nominating
speech lor the most illustrious
nominee of 1952 Jcrtcrson
Davis.

One of the best “jogs" was
Ed “Whiz'zér” Wéitz, the i953
candidate from Con-lcs. “Whiz-
zer" had a tcrritic campaign in
that every day of the week had
a‘special publicity stunt. One
day ,thcicwas a pipcr cub

a true candidate, something
which a, “jag" had never clone
before. He had a platform of
co-cd dorms, no week-day
classes, and to burn the Union.
he lost to Roger Perry.

Perhaps the most famous
"lag“ 01 all umcs occured in
1954 in the form of Dick ”Ti-

this was the first time 3 cans

convention), “Tiger,” using the
alias oi “Colonel Zinnzinndonf,"
and dressed as Gcncral MacAr-

crowd, namcly “I think i

Aticru-ards, he was cscoricd

Convention Confusion Clear;

Ailer Procedure Explanal‘ion

By Bob Curvey

,Each year as Student
Council convention time ap-
pl'onches, there appears on
tile scene a great deal of con—
fusion concerning the conven-
tion rules and regulations.

The 1955 convention will run
somethi g like thi -‘ at 2 this
afternoon StudentrCouncil Pros
idcnt Bob Mchinscy will call
me convention to order. He
.will first read the rulcs lor the

.convontion and make all neces-
sary announcements.

/ Roll Call

This will-lie followed by .the
iirst roll call of the halls’ dele-
gation. The halls will be called
in the order they are. seated

(alphabetically). The purpose of
this roll call is to establish that
each hall has the correct num»
ber ofhdelegales on the convene
lion floor; : ' . -

Halls will lie allowed one
delegate for every iour per-
sons ii ing in or affiliated
with the halt-These delegates
and the dclegatc chairman
must have been selected by
noon today.

The number oi delegates lor
cach hall is as lollows: Clark,
13; Cleveland, 14, Cou-lcs, 13;
Dibhlc, 13; Gates, is; Haincs,
17; James, 13; London, 14;
loosc, z-l; Main, 14; Mears, 3;
North Younkor, ll; Rawson, 12;
Read, 18; Smith, 14 and South
Younkcr, 17.

Next comes the second or
nomlnalion roll call. The halls

are called in alphabetical order
and the delegate chairmen may

recognize any person he desires
for [he nominating and Second-
ing speeches.

Only candidates who had

their petitions in and approv-
.ed by the Election Board lly

the designated date are el'»
giiilc tor nomination. Each
liall may nominate as many
candidates as it pleases, but
only 15 minutes lor speeches
and 15 minutes lor demonstra—
tion will be allowed tor each
candidate.

All nominations must be inadc
during this roll call and no nom-
inations ol uiipcutioncd candi—

dates “'1” be accepted from the
floor.

Balloting

Allcr the occond roll call, the
balloiing begins. The first balls
lot is the instructed one and
each dclcgatcmust vote as his
hall«i struclcd him. After this
'irallot, candidates are free to
vote for . any-t candidate . they
please. ' '

After-”the . instructed ballot.
balloting continues until each oi
two candidates receives a mini—
mum oi as pel‘jcollt of the votes
cast on tlic'sainc_ oallcl. These

two ,candidiles’ '11 come out
of the convention. The final 56‘
Motion of the Student Council
president will be made by the
student body in ARl-l Monday
Hom 8145' 'd.m.i unlll 4:15 p.ln.

Puss, :Yield, nocognition

Two miles that.havc caused
coniusion i the' past are the
‘~ " and id" rules. The
“pass", ul states that ii any
hall in o cast no votes last,
i stood ol in alphabetical ordcr,
it may pass. This simply means
that this hall will bc called ai-
tcr the regular roll call has
been complctcd. However, it
moi-c than one hall passes, thcsc
halls will be called in alphabets
iC'dl order following the rcgular
roll call. No one hall may pass
more than \)>\CL‘ during a single
ballot.

'rlic “yielding" rule can he
stated as follows: during the,
nomination roll call. any luill
wishing to yield to another
linll may do so alter being
recognized. The hall yielded
to will then make its nomln»
iilion.

After this hall has completed
its nominating and seconding,
the yicldinc hall will ihcn take
ils turn and the roll call will
continuc m lphabctical order.
Any hall ‘. ‘it, asbcen yielded.
to will be skipped when its turn
comes in thc alphabetical calling.
riclding will take place only
during thc nominating ballot.

"Recognition" is also a prob
lcm that often causes conlusion.
Wlicii a ball is called during
the nomination roll call, it may
recognize any one person for
the purpose at making nomin-
ating speech. The hall may then
rccognizc any number ol peer
plc [or the purpose of making
secoiidiug spcochcs.

pi-cscntly looks like a thi-cc way

lhc apparent leaders at the

with her vigorous campaign—
ing and council experience,
Wagner's poor showing has
surprised most observers, with
the result that her stock can
move in no other direction
than up. she is deﬁnitely not
to be counted out in a long
convention.

Wcitzman's apparent precon-
vcnlion strength has doubtless
bccn diminished by his coming
out as serious at such an early
hour. The dcvlopmcnt has sin»
pi-isrd his trisnds and driven
his other crstwhlle supporters
into Cooper or indcpcndcut
camps. Had his initial strengih
been great lbrough a “jag"
campaign, his chances for cmcl'g-

be bcttcr.

loyal support. it he is able to
get the reouircd 35% during the
first few ballots, he will liklly
go all the way. The only pos-
sible dciraction, I will look at
later.

Reed may well have started
too early. with the result thixl.
his campaign appcars to be
running out or gas, although
we are again laced with a
fairly hard core. Aside from
Langan, however, it is possibly
icss loyal in a showdown than
Thompson’s. His occasional
ultra-sharp criticism of the
present Council may hare
hurt more than it helped:
Jones, starting late. but rolling
fast ‘snd speaking well, seems
to have captured much of the
previously uncommitted suppo .
His central core of power, wh e
now railing 'a bit short of Lic

loyalty in a showdown. 1r .ic

shows up with him and hump-
son emerging.

One oi' the “Clark four",
namely, Gordie Hunt, could
be an extremely formidable
candidate, drawing heavily on
the large Cooper and uncom-
mitted blocks, as well as i'roiii
Thompson, need, and Jones.
With the present pool or
apathy, thci-c is much room in

Probably the sharpcst con—
