was a triﬂe too stiﬁ and stylized,

wasn't too sure if he was think.

The best suggestion I can make
to Al consists of one word: “Re-
lax”! ,

lane nicks as Nat's l
Essie, also seemed to have,a l
slight prohlem with character. 1
She was in and out of her role
at times. The outs were intre-
quent and seemed to occur
mostly when she began to
raise her voice A shrillness
crept through that made Essie
tend towards shrewishriess,
which I don't believe O'Neill
intended.

Bill Christman's Arthur was
quite correctly supercilious and
solemn. The only thing that
bothered me was the gruff voicel
which Bill gave to Arthuri It’s}
rather hard to the supercilious’
and solemn with a gruff voice.
Bill could have done a much
better job with his natural
voice.

Sylvia Spencer and Tom Al-
ter were very well matched as I
the unrequited lovers. Sylvia’s
Lily was believahly sweet and
proper, and needless to say l
Tom's Sid was perfect. as the t
play‘s comedian, although some
of his runniest lines were
drowned out in the laughter
from his previous ones. ltide l
your laughs, Tom! l

Guy Scandlen was ideal as
the prim and proper McComber=
although he had a tendency tof
swallow some of his words matr-
ing it difficult to hear and un-i
derstand him 3

Diane Stevenson made the,
perfect Belle, so perfect in factl
that if I didn’t know better i:
would think she was type cast.

My big criticism of Mike ,
Cassady‘s Bartender is that he l
Wasn’t on stage enough. no is ;
a natural comic, and he arid 1
Tom Alter should be cast to~ ,
gether in a comedy soon.

Susan Hass as Muriel was
perfect She was the right mix-
ture of adolescent naivete and
shrewdness. She only appears in
one scene, the beach scenk
but it is the scene which must
share the honors with the bar,
room scene as the best in the
show.

Tommy and Mildred, as
played by Scott Donahoe and i
Judith Mahle respectively, 1
were quite convincing as the 1
young Miller‘s. Untortunatcly
the play was written toi- their
adolescent brother and con-
sequcntly lert them very little
to get their teeth into,

Frances Confer as Norah pick-l
ed up where she left oﬁ in
“Night Must Fall" and once
again played a perfect Irish
waiting girl. John Morris was
comically sinister as the schem-
ing college playiboy, and Jerry
Voorhis added his talent to the
bar room scene with his fine in—
terpretation of the cxtrovert,
traveling salesman.

ln conclusion, anyone who
doesn’t get a big bang out of

this show should he cal‘m’nittedn
