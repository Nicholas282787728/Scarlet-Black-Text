AWS Constitution
Receives Scrutiny
Al Open Meeling

An open meeting of the Grin-
nell Association of Women Stu-
dents was held Wednesday eve-
ning at which Mary Emily Han.
nah, president of the associa-
tion, discussed revisions in the
articles on election procedure
and sub-committees contained
in the AWS constitution. She
stated that the purpose of this
meeting and the ones to fol-
low was to acquaint the League
Board with the ideas that the

women students have on these
revisions.

In giving the board‘s stand
on election procedure, M. E.
said that they felt the present
system is dangerous in that a
girl could be elected League
Board president on the sec-
ond ballot with only 34% of
the total votes. She suggest-
ed a revision that would put
the twu candidates receiv—
ing the highest number of
votes on the ﬁrst ballot up
lor the ﬁnal election, thus as-
suring that a. Stu-Called dark-
horse candidate couldn’t win
the election because or a
deadlock.

it was suggested from the
ﬂoor that if a candidate re-
ceived a large margin of votes
on the first ballot that there
should then be no second vote.

A short discussion tollowed
on revidou oi the Social
Budget committee. M. n. cm-
phasized that in the past the
Budget committee has been a
very eﬂeoﬁve body, but in
light at its present iunctlon
it needs to be overhauled.
She asked those attending the
meeting how they felt about
tho changes proposed in two
previous editorials in the
Scarlet and Black.

Among the suggestion from
the ﬂoor were: that the funds
should be united under the
treasurer ot the League board;
that the hall social chairmen
should comprise the committee
rather than the sewing machine
chairman, etc; that the League
Board president Should not be
the chairman and that the com-
mittee be abolished entirely.

Concert Program.
Family Slyle Food

The Student Council, presided
over by M. E. Hannah, filling
in for ailing President Bob Mc-
Jimsey, Thursday evening con-
sidered next semester’s social
events, the new foods program,
and problems of student eme
ployment.

The most significant innova-
tion in the social program to be
considered was in regard to a
possible presentation at a stu-
dent jazz concert by Herbie Han-
cock’s nineteen piece aggrega-
tion, The concert. to take place
in the spring. would cost the
council about $200, to be allo-
cated to expenses such as mu.
sic, programming, set, etc, with-
out ccmpensation for the musi-
cians. '

Alter hearing a tentative
outline for (he one and one~
hat: hour, sixteen selection
concert, the council voted to
support the effort. It was the
consensus of the council in its
debates that such events should
be encouraged both iron: the
standpoint o1 entertainment
and of stimulation of student
ﬂcﬁvltles generally

Other proposals tor social
events brought in from central
committee and heard from the
floor were arrangements cl a
night club act, appearance of a
folk singer, or presentation of
a vocal or instrumental quartet.

All three of these ideas receiv-
ed considerable support, and
the job of outlining specifics
was referred to central com-
mittee.

Student polls revealed over-
whelming support tor a trial
run of iamlly style evening
meals in both dining haus, but
a companion measure provid-
ing Sunday evening meals in
the dining halls without alter-
ation oi loud now served was
rejected almost unanimously.

With regard to the imminent
foods changeover, complaints
were voiced that the new ar-
rangement could easily cause
widapread student unemploy-
ment in both dining halls. While

Fund Total Reaches $928,000; I
Million Mark is Next Objective

By Jane Russell

“We hope to be over the

million mark by the time the

Des Moines and Mason City campaigns are completed," said
George M, Susens, director of development, regarding the
fund-raising campaign now in progress. The most recently
released figure of the national fund total is $928,000.
“The Silver Dollar Story", a 20-minute, color movie
to be used in connection with the development drive, arrived
this week. “The film points up— n

the inadequacies of the present

library and fine arts' facilities,

said Susens. “It also attempts to
show the excellence of Grin—
nell'S academic standing and

various departmental activities."
May Be Shown

For the most part the film
was produced on campus this
tall. Susens stated that if there
is sufficient interest, a showing
tor students can probably be
arranged. The title of the movie
reflects the growth of the Col-
lege Since 1846 when James J.
Hill presented a silver dollar
as the original endowment of
the college.
