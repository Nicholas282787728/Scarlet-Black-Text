Menotti 'Medium'
To Be Presented

“Medium," a tragic melo~
drama by Gian-Carlo Menotti
will be presented June 7 in the
Grinnell high school auditorium
Ccrclyn Toi't, Sandy Rose, Susie
Morris, Guy Scandlen, and
Marilyn Mayer will have roles.

Music will be directed by
Don Jones (music). Richard
Meyer (speech) will be in
charge of Sets and Ned Donahoe
(speech) will direct acting.

sily and appealingly zl fighter
in his lovemaking). Unfortun—
ately his escape into the Term
lncognita was almost unnotice-
able as he and Quixote slid out
the gate.

Ellen Petersilie as Esmer-
alda gave by flu" the best
performance of the evening.
She was tantalizingly brazen
and then soft, aL‘WayS in per-
fect control of her lines, her
character and the pace of licr
scenes. Her brush Gypsy
mother (Anne Moore) did an
excellent comic job, convlnc-
ing in detail from the voice
and tin cymbal to the furry
slippers,

Cy Silver had a little of CES‘
anova-the faded elegance that
refuses to bend to recognize its
situation, the self-conscious
tragedy, the stiff Courtliness—
but he lacked passion. He was
a little too stiltecl; even the
Worn-out lover wanted more
dash and violence.

Caryl Wagner as lCamille
lacked the shadowy delicacy
and pathos of the dying woman
with nothing left but her pre-
tense. She looked and acted en»
tirely too healthy, despite the
black circles under her eyes,
but once, in the scene where
she missed the plane. she was
perfectly convincing.

Joe Nassif, who until Es—
meralda was the only actor
who seemed to be thinking
about what he said and mean-
ing it, didn't do as well with
Byron as he did with Quixoter
Byron’s phony limp was
overdone, and there Wasn’t
enough that was impressively
romantic about him. His
Quixote, however, had a wry
grandeur that went nicely at
the end with Kilroy’s minor
heroism.

Gutman was disappointing. As
the sinister deity, he should
have radiated evil and harsh
control of at least the mechan-
ics of desperation, lbut Dennis
Furibush seemed determined to
make him earnest and maybe
even a little bit nice, and he

relished Gutmzn’s words too
much, thereby sacrificing their
‘brutality. He did make himself
felt as the dramatic eu-ordinator
of the play.

There was a tendency to
swallow words on the parts
of most actors, and several
Si niiicant scenes were allow-
ed to go by default Particuv
llarly noticeable was the scene
of the survivor which should
have been horrible and funny,
and was only tiredly funny.

Council Hears

KG Report.
0. K.'s Letter

Student Council Tuesday
night heard reports on
KGRW, the proposed SC let-
tel' to incoming students,
breakfast holll‘S, and calling
hours at the health center.

KGRW chief engineer Dick
Scott informed the council that
the Federal Communications
commission recently inspected
the KGRW facilities and report-
ed that the station is now with-
in the law in its operation.

Scott also said that at pres~
cut all halls have transmitr
ters in operation with the ex-
ception ct Cowles, North and
South Younker. The construc-
tion of these buildings has
caused the difficulty. now-
ever, Scott said that they
should be receiving xcew in
the near future.

He Went on to say that the
reason there have been several
complaints concerning “whistle”
is that the station staff has not
yet Completed a Crystal oscillator
to stabilize the frequency. This
also should be corrected in a
short time.

Scott urged students to report
to him or his staff if recep-
tion of KGRW is not good. He
said that this was the only way
that he could find but about
existing trouble,

In accordance with action
of the council at its April 30
meeting, the first draft of a
letter to be sent to incoming
students informing them of
SC actlvities has been drawn
up. .

The letter was read, and
council members offered sugges-
tions in regard to its contents.
The council then voted approv-
at of spending the necessary
money to have the letter print-

duction was startling and
mostly exciting, The pace was
slow at first, but gained in
momentum after the first
three or four ‘hlocks.’ The less
major parts were all well
done, and the streetcleaners
and street people were ex»
lremely effective

Weird as this play is. l’m
not sure but what Williams has
a point to make about the
chaotic grotesqueness of hu»
manity (or lack of it). it was
in evidence yesterday when on
central campus, which was lum»
inous with new foliage, an army
rcserve unit paraded like so
many grim and determined
beetles in front of a battalion
of ROTC men who looked like
regimented bus drivers, ”Cani—
ino Real” mirrors this kind of
disproportion, burlesques it, and
when it's all over there’s some-
thing to think about.

Sauers Announces
Lowest Attrition
ln College History

Approximately 17 per cent of
the 1957-53 student body will
not return to Grinncll for the
195359 academic year. Robert
c. Sauers, director of admis»
sions, announced that this is the
lowest attrition rate in the his-
tory of the college.

The attrition rate is based
on the number of students
who have reserved rooms for
the cnming year. Currently
915 students are in residence.
This includes 168 seniors who
are not included in the attrie,
tion figure, A total of 304
reservations have been made
by next year’s sophomores,
juniors and seniors.

Students who have not def~
initely planned to return num-
ber 127. Of these 41 are on
probation, 35 have planned to
transfer and 51 are uncertain of
their plans. Some of these will
probably be returning, Sauers
stated, so the actual amount of

attrition cannot be definitely
determined.

Saga Food service informed
the council that the reason
breakfast hours had been mov-
ed up from 7 to 7:15 am, was
one of economy. However, Saga
offered to add another perscn
behind the breakfast line cn

up operations, The council so
recommended,

Bob Norris reported, follow.
ing a meeting with Mrs.
Pershing Gnoselaw (head
nurse), that at present there
are no visiting hours at the
health center. Norris explain.
ed that the reason for this
was that with only one nurse
on duty, it was impossible
for her to watch both patients
nnd visitors.

The council voted to write a
letter to the chairman of the
Health commission recommend-
nig that p ovisions be made for
regular visiting and ofiice hours
next year,

in other action Student Couns
cil voted to send letters of
appreciation to Saga Food ser

Jena”

To the Editor:

A fella probably never gets
all the things said he wants to
say and it’s taken me an extra

eek to get around to saying
anything this time

I’d like to come to the de-
fense of the “Malteaser”. I

wasn't so much opposed to the
comments that were made as to
the setting in which they were
made. Surely, the magazine was
bad, but it wasn't all bad. And
many of us must have approved
the idea of it; we bought 425
copies. You and I, we take guys
like Joe and we say, ”Great,
Joe, it’s a fine idea . . . just
what the campus needs.” We
grant our support to people in
new endeavors, encouraging
them to do things we’d like but
don‘t have the time, inclination,
initiative, intelligence, or ambi-
tion to do ourselves. Then,
when it’s done we slap ’em in
the face, kick ’em when they're
down, and rub salt into their
wounds that we‘ve inflicted.
Why? Come on now, don’t tell
me it was that bad. There was
some real humor there and
some that was pointed particu-
larly to Grinnell.

Paul's name and handiwork
appeared inside the cover so
l'm sure he must have thought
it possible to reinstate the
magazine on campus Let‘s not
criticize to he fashionable
This was an issue from which
to ‘take lessons. The people
who made it found out what
they were up against and
now have a basis from which
to work, It was an announce»
ment of efforts made and of
a potentiality that exists

Surely we are not justified
in giving up on the «basis of the
first issue. A magazine of this
nature depends for its livellr
hood on the contributions, ins
terest, and support of the en-
tire student body. This is our
magazine and we can be proud
of it, Malty can become a per-
manent and popular campus per»
sonalily.
