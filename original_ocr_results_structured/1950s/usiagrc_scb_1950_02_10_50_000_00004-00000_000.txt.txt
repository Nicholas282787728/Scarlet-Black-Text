Cagers Trike Monmouth and Third;

Ta
l/

A stubborn Monmouth team
became the Pioneers’ ‘fourth
straight conference victim as
Grinnell gained revenge on the
Fighting Scots 6363 in a rough.
contest last Saturday night in
Darb m.

This Sin, coupled with Knox’s
upset of Carleton, gave _coach
Pfltsch’s charges a clear title to
third place in the league stand—
ings.

The Pioneers jumped to an
early 9-2 lead, but the Scots
caught up and went ahead 13712
with the game 11 minutes old.

Grihnell In Front

A basket by Earl Peisner put
Grinnell out in front once more
and there the Pioneers stayed
until almost the end of the first
half. Torl‘ence sunk a shot from
outside the free throw circle to
give Monmouth a 30-28 edge
at half time.

In the second period, the Pioe
ncers wiped out this deficit and
rolled to a 36-31 advantage on
the marksmanship of Pelsner
and Jim Heinyi

Don Brooks and Terrence be-
gan hitting for the visitors and
once again the Scots led 3746
with six minutes gone in the
final half.

Dave Dunlop then dumped in
three quick buckets and Bob
Bigelow made a free throw to
restore Grinnell to a 4337 mar-
gin.

Despite another Monmouth
flurry, the Pioneers retained
control of the boards and
Heiny, Peisner, and Dunlop
again found the range to keep
the Scarlet and Black out of
serious danger.

Pfitsch’s outfit built up a 57-
51 lead with only three minutes
remaining in the game and were
in charge of things till the fin-
ish.

Dunlap took scoring honors

with 19 points, mostly on tip-l

ins. Brooks, Monmoulh's Negro
star, and Jackson led the lllinois
aggregation with 18 and 12
points respectively.

Peisner chalked up 14 points
and Bigelow got ll as did
Heiny. All of Jim’s markers
came in the second half.

lleveland Takes Second
Over Meal-s, Haines in VB

Cleveland sewed up second
place in the volleyball tournae
ment by crushing Haines 46-14
and Mears 59.11 Monday and
Tuesday. Loose hall won the
volleyball title last week.

Marie Blattner ‘scored 15
points and Barbara Britten
racked up ll points for Cleve-
land in the Mears battle. Lovice
Sturtevant and Margaret Mc-
Dowell led the second placers’
offensive against the Hellers
with 11 points each.

Basketball play will get under
way next as will the ping pong
tournament.

Unbeaten Gregg

f6 Meet Partin,
Ace From Cornell

By Phil Benuet

'Wrestllng at Grinnell is rap.
idly gaining in popularity, a
condition primarily mode pos
sible by the exceptionally line
grappling of Pioneer heavy
weight, Harold “Bud" Gregg.

Bud, a 5-ft., lleini, 197-pound
senior has run his intercolleg-
iate mat streak to 18 consecu»
two wins. Only Cornell's not-
ionally—ranked Al Partln stands
in the way of Bud’s going unde-
feated in three seasons of var—
slty competition.

Coach Hank Brown is ser-
lously thinking of entering Bud
in the top mat tourney in the
land, the NCAA meet, which
Wlll be held at Cedar Rapids
this March, Bud, if he enters,
will scale down to 175 pounds
and wrestle in that weight
class.

Bud got in two seasons of
wrestling competition while at
Austin High School of Chicago.
During 1946 he captained the
mat squad and won the Chip
high school 175
title, no mean trick for a tender
lad of 16.

Gregg, who skipped a grade
in primary school, enjoys moe
torcyoling, weight lifting, and
football, a sport in which he
has earned two letters while at
Grinnell.

Bud rarely travels alone. In
fact he can be frequently seen
with a aft, 5»l'n. blonde, a
Grinnellian who monopolizes,
most of his time when off the
mat and gridiron.

Bud, a Smith senior, is an
economics major and is undecid»,
ed about his plans after gradu-l
ation.

Although idlc this weekend,
the Pioneers will journey east

cd by the varsity’s poor showing

sessions in the women's gym
to accustom his squad to the
“unique” conditions prevailing
