Currently sporting a five

unhappy Coe squad would
like nothing better than to
avenge their early season loss to
the Pioneers, and get back into

Grinncll victories tonight and
tomorrow would not only pull
the Pioneers out of the Confer—

the home fans something to
cheer about for a change. lt‘s

Pioneer Hopes

Facing the usual Grinnell
problem of no prospects,~. the
Grinnell track team is hard at
work preparing for a
that looks a little on the hope-
less side.

With only six lettcrmen rc-
turning from a team that didn‘t
cven qualify for the conference
meet last year, even the usual-
ly optimistic coach, EG Booth,
sounded a bit skeptical as he
discussed the coming season.

is the team hopelessl “No,"
said Booth, “but the boys are
green, We’re working with ma-
terial this year that never even
competed in high school track.“
Well then, were they about in
the same class as the football
team was last fall? “Yes, about
the same." Obviously Mr. Booth’s
definition of hopeless differed
greatly from our own,

The team will be built around
the handful of lettermen. Terry
