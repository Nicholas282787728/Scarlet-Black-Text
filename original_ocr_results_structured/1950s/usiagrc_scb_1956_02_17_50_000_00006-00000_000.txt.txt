Writing for national educational
and religious journals. After
first serving as director of
NCCJ'S southern division in St.
Louis, Bishop went to his pres-
ent post at Chicago in 1943.

Bishop is also one of the
founders of World Brothers
hood, an international human
relations organization During
the summer of 1950 he travel-
ed throughout countries of
western Europe, meeting with
government and religious lead-
ers to enlist support for the
movement, Then in 1953 he
spent the summer visiting most
of the countries of the Near
East, studying the agricultural,
political, and economic prob-
lems 01 this area and con-
,ferring with government and
religious leaders.

Bishop's ability as a speaker

has been widely noted. After a‘

talk before the University club
of Des Moines, one member
wrote: “Bishop is not only an
impelling speaker, but also a
man with a real message . . .
He is obviously one who be-
lieves in the work he is doing,
and who is able to sell others
on the efficacy and value and
rightness of that work. I can
honestly say that he is one of
the most‘ powerful speakers 1
have had the good fortune to
hear . . . "
