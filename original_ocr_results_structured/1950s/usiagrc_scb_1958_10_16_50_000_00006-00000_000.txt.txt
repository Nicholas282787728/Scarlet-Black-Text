SCARLET AND BLACK

October lb, I958

 

Jami-a

To the Editor:

This summer, while discussing
Grinnell as it was and is with
a graduate of 1926, I was amusV
ed to hear or a quaint and
curious crusade which was led
by the banner of good reason
back in those dark and forgotten
times.

it seems that as a prep this
. graduate in Mr. Joe Lee who
wrote sometimes tor the Wall
Street Jamal) had spear-
headed a ireshman revolt
against the old sentiment»en-
crusted riturll or prepping. He
even went so tar is to write
letters to the editor ot the
school paper; and, surprised
that the embattled landmark
was still icebly standing in
1958, remarked that leading
retornn movements against
prepping must have become as
much a part oi the lreshman
tradition at Grinnell as prep—
ping itself.

Judging trom the shoot: it
brings with it, propping must
have been the ﬁrst serious ob—
stacle met by its victims which
would not yield to the good
sense of their reason. “Even
Mommy and Daddy listened to
my side," a prep was heard 10
say. And tor year utter envlgorr
ating year Grinncll props, and
a few other worshippers of the
great golden idol, common
sense. throw all their reasonable.
calculating iorce against it. How
strange it is that a crumbling
and worm-eaten old custom
could have survived such a
cleansing. sterilizing, pcrtcc'ng
and destroying deluge of cr
ism so long.

The learned worshippers or
reason say that Rousseau’s
logic isn’t logical, that he was
crazy too, zmti that his, ideas
have caused a great deal of
trouble—as well they may, tor
they seem to have captured a
great many minds across the
world. I do not know it there
is 1 small vuire in the heart
or every man which leads him
“back to nature.” it seems
that a much noisier one is
present in Grinnell upperelass—
men's inner parts screaming
obnoxiously. ”Back to prep
~pingl" But we shall not go to
embarrassment, loudness, spin
its, passions of all kinds, nor
(and it is unthinkable in to»
day”: anesthetic society) to
the nasty old thing called pain.

As you all know, there are
two streams of thought in our
history which scholars trace on
intellectual maps, and little
creatures such as l ﬂounder in
They are always asking quesV
tions as to which one to navi—
gate: ls it Voltaire or Rousseau
who is correct? Can a little
pain be good for a person" Does
something have to bc utilitarian
to have worth? is tradition an
excuse for anything? Do some
things which reason can destroy
have value it cannot detect?l
And you know all the rest, l

I hope you don't think ‘I am i
going to try to answer THOSE n
questions and possibly work
up to that intellectual puzzler i
at the day—is prepping good ‘

or bad? No, indeed: I am
starting a' campaign myseli, ,
with the strong support oiy

To the editor:

Although i do not believe a
loud obstrcpcrous ircshman_
we have low ot these at Grin-
llellishould not be made aware
of his ottcnsivc behavior, I do
not believe that an uppcrclass
man has thc right to use coer-
cion to torce a trcshman student
into the niche he thinks he
ought to tit into,

Coercion is used, however,
ostensibly to mold the incom-
ing lreshinan into the refined,
cultured, aware individual he
apparently is not. when the
means to attain this noble end
assumes the character or
”food-call” taking 114. hours
per week in the evening, mak—
ing the bed oi the paternal,
hut indolent, upperclnssman,
‘marching around at 11:30 at
night in unison and other
types ot degradation, it would
seem that the end is not the
edilled prep, but rather the
pleased upperclassman. it is
those uiieonstruetive aspects
of prepping which deter rather
than aid a new student's ad-
justment to a college environ»
ment.

If it is impossible to modify
the prepping program so that
the aforementioned imconstruc-
tive aspects are eliminated, the
only equitable thing would seem
to be abolition.

Gale Cites Meriis
0f Physics Series

Grant 0, Gale (physics), durr
ing his leave oi abscncc last
year, worked with the American
Institute at Physics in New
York City setting up and evale
uating material uscd in televisv
ion classroom program.

Previously, ielevision class-
room series had been given
through a closed circuit within
the high school or college
where the programs were
shown. This year, however, the
“TV Continental Classroom,"
is pioneering with a physics
series by presenting it on :tn‘
inpel’l ndt nal circuit.

This series consists o[ a year's
course in physics on 162 tilms
written by Harvey White, pro~
fossor ot physics at the Uiiivcis—
ity ol Calitornia These courses
may be taken tor credit in 200
colleges throughout the United
States (including lowa State
Teachers college) and arc being
used by teachers and students
alike.

in evaluating the use of class»

m programs on national tele-
vi on networks, Gale said, "I
think this cltort to reach more
physics teachers and upgrade
high school courses is an excel»
lent plan.”

class load, lectures, reading and other outside
work, intellectual pursuits have to bc neglected”
(Bill Cllrlstmzln). “Pl'olcssors don’t encourage
enough intellectual curiosity; there are not
enough dlo useion periods in classes” (Jacobson).
“With the time you devote to class work and
social obligations to the school and \‘al‘lous'or-
ganizations, your time is too limited" (Flora).

"NO IVORY TOWER"

“A person who uses his mind accurately, ct—
tectively and who is interested in things that
involve thought and abstract concepts." tits
Dean of the College R. Homcr N9rton’s concept
ot the intellcetual. “There is no ivory tower at
Grinnoll [or the intellectual; it you have the
‘ivory towel" concept ot intellectualism, you
don’t belong at Grilmcll,” he continued. Norton
also stated that there is amplc time and op»
portunity on the Grmnell campus for intellec—
tual pursuits it a person is so inclined,

"The term ‘intellectualism' may not coin-
cide with the word ‘scholarly.’ An intellectual
is a person oi cultivated intelligence." These
were the words used by Dean .ot Women
Evelyn Gardner in her statement concerning
the intellectual character.

Earl F. Pelsncr (dean Di men) defines his
concept of the intellectual in the following man-
ner: "The intellectual has a strong interest in
and has developed skills in critical reading and
thinking." Peisner feels that there definitely are
intellectual personalities an this campus. “How-
ever," he added, “there are some students who
feel they do lmt Til. on our campus because they
contend that there is a lack of intellectual stim—
ulatlun llsl'c."
