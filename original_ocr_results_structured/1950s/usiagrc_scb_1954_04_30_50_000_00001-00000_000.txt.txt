Authorities Are

Still Not Able
To Find Vandal

Police and college authorities
have not yet been able to de-
termine the identity of the per.
son who entered ARK last Sat-
urday night, causing minor
damage. They also have not de.
termined the cause of a small
fire found in the drama prop
room on first floor.

The vandal entered Aim
through a classroom window
on the east side oi the build-
ing, next to the men‘s rest
room, Name plates were re-
moved irom faculty office
doors and bulletin boards
were stripped. “Grinnell
Stinks" was written on the
blackhoards in most rooms.

The soil; office was entered
and old papers and cuts were
torn up and scattered on the
floor. Nothing of value in the
building was harmed.

The damage was discovered
early Sunday morning by a
night watchman who noticed
smoke coming from the build-
ing. He iound a small fire in
a wastebasket in the prop
room, and removed it before
it could spread.

The wastebasket contained
oily mops, and an analysis of
the oil by the chemistry depart.
ment indicated that it had a
low ﬂash point and that span
taneous combustion was not the
probable cause. Police and col—
lege authorities doubt that the

,fire was an arson attempt.

Photographs of the signs on
the classroom blackboards and
of a footprint ‘beneath the win»
dow used in entering and lesv~
ing the building are being used
in the investigation.

Ferguson said that he was
struck and knocked down by
one of the two men who were
arguing with some of the loo
or so students gathered on
the north side of Cowles hall
Friday night, April 16.
Students and other onlookers
had gathered as a result of the
false fire alarm which had
brought firemen to battle a non-
existent blaze in Cowles hall.

According to Justice Cole,
Criswcll pleaded guilty to
Ferguson's assault and battery
charge at 10:30 am, Saturday,
April 24, and the trial, set for
2 pm. the same day, was not
held. Ferguson said he had

day, Justice Cole said that his
“Chief purpose, of course" in
suspending the fine to $25, ”is
to prevent a repetition of the
same offense. He (Criswell)
would think twice before doing
the same thing with a suspended
fine hanging over his head."

The Constitution which is be-

only articles one. two, three“
four, six, and seven which em
body the executive and judici -
sections. Grants of power which
will provide authority for other
areas will be drawn up by
president Samuel N, Stevens.

There are two principle points
in controversy. The first is that
the c of HP and League Board
shall adopt and enforce regula-
tions pertaining to dormitory
living in their respective areas
— as suggested by the Student
Organizations committee instead
of these bodies having veto
power over any disapproval by
the Executive council of rules
[they make as provided in the
Constitution. The other objec-
tion which has not been settled
is that closed sessions for ju-
dicial committees may be voted
only by a unanimous decision
of the committee involved ac»
cording to the Constitution.
‘which should be changed to per»
mit a majority of the committee
to vote such a session, accord—
ing to the Student Organizations
group. ’
