fully last year. I am chairman
of this committee. and I know
that I can speak for all mem-
bers when I say that we will
be very happy to devote com»
mittee time to a discussion of
this problem with any delega-
tion of interested students.
whom you might select. 0b-
viously it will be extremely
difficult to hold a useful com.
mittee meeting with two or
three hundred students

The responsibility for ad-
ministering the critical points
in any grading system, as they
may effect either honor stu—
dents, or students who must be
placed on probation or dismls.
sed from college for academic
failure is vested in the Person.
nel Board. Therefore, I shall
take it upon myself to see that
this petition is brought to the
immediate attention of this
committee.

Finally, as Dean of the Col~
lege, I am charged with the re-
sponsibility for adnu'nistering
the academic program. The
grading system is a part of
that program. I shall be very
pleased to spend any amount of
time necessary in discussing
the various aspects of this pe.
tition with any and all groups
of interested students.

1 sincerely hope that you will
give the statements, which rep.
resent my position, the widest
possible clrculation among the
members of the student body.

Cordially,

Max Fuller
Dean of the College
