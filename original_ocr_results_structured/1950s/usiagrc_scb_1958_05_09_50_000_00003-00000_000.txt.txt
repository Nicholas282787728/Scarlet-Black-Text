AN OPEN LETTER TO PRES- To the Editor:

IDENT BOWEN

Elimination of speech cor-
rection from the Grinnell col-
lege curriculum, now under
consideration by the faculty, is
undergoing severe criticism in
Quadrangle conversations. why
is it that a nationally welfarec-
ognized department, a Giannell
first (speech correction is a
liberal arts curriculum). with
majors demanded by high sal-
aries, is undergoing faculty
criticism?

Because it isn‘t a “pure" lib-
oral. an? Because it’s ”practi-
cal”? Because senior majors av-
erage only live? Because it's a
'slough" major?

True, it might not be con-
sidcred a “pure" liberal arts
subject. But, what’s “)ml'e"
about air science, interior dec-
oration. principles of account-
ing, introduction to statistics,
psychological measurement,
statistical methods, orchestra-
tion, newswriting. gathering
and editing, instrumental tech-
niques and materials. methods
in team sports, mechanical
drawing: graphics, public atl-
ministration, marriagc and
the family, and acting?

Five majors is not less than
many other departments have
now at Grinncll. According to
our recent catalog, majors in
the class of 1957 numbered as
follows: French~l; g e n e r a1
science—4; arr-Ha: philosophy
and religion~8; comparative
literatureiﬁ; Spanishgi; phy
icsq; ano political sciencei
In addition. 43 per cent of the
correctionists in the last ten
years have gone on to graduate
school, and many of them to
get their Ph.D.’s.

It definitely isn’t a “slough"
major. Each correctionist puts
in approximately 400 clock
hours in the speech clinic in
the junior and senior years.
Also, teacher and/or parent con-
ferences are held.

This program is a service to
the Grinnell community. Speech
correction clinics are held in
each of the four Grinnell ele-
mentary schools. the high school,
the college clinic, and the out‘
patient clinic which also ser-
vices Newton. All of the work
is done by the college majors
under the direction of M
Velma B. Hiscr, This has grca
1y helped town—gown relations.

Grinnellians have lagrced
that women have a rightful
place in a liberal arts college.

loundation for rearing and
teaching children. Speech
correction is one ol the draw—
ing cards for women to come
to Grinnell. Common conver-
sation has it that not only the
speech correction program,
but also the elementary edu—
cation. art, and physical edu-
cation programs are on their
way out. too, if approved by
the locally and trustees.

Is Grinncll aiming tor a men's
college?

Grinnell should be proud
that it—unlike a tlnivcrsity or
teacllers’ college—can provide
women as well as men with a
liberal arts education as well
as a means to applv it, What's
wrong with getting a liberal
arts educatloll~ and something
else. too?
