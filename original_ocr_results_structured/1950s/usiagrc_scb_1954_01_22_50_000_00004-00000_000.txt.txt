SCARLET AND BLACK

Slants on Spo ris

After this weekend's conrerence action, a four»way tie f r

tirst is not only possible, but likely. Carleton (which doesn't play)‘

already has a 4‘2 mark, which Grinnell can equal by downing

Lawrence (which would drop to filth place), Coe by beating both,

Monmouth and Knox, and Cornell by falling to Monmouth and
defeating Knox. s 0 s

Once Carleton gets back into inst place, nobody will shove.
the Carls out again. With its three toughest road games out ot_the,
way (Grinnell, Cornell, and Coe), Carleton Should have little,
trouble in racing to its Seconld straight conference crown, The
Carls, who dumped Drake and Gustavus Adolphus (ranked as the
best college team in Minnesota), will really hit the pig timeIan,

In our discussion of Statistics D 27 last week, we proved that‘
Grinnell is 78 points better than Indiana. However, Grinnell 1051‘
to St. Olaf 34-59, which lost to Cornell 8343, which lost to Coe‘
72-70, which lost to Carleton 78453, which lost to_ South Dakota,
State 78-68, which was beaten by Drake 73‘59, which was routed
by‘ Bradley 93—53, which was edged by Alabama 63-61, which was.
beaten by Texas 72-52, which lost to Oklahoma A at M 54-37»
which was barely downed by Minnesota 5156, which tell hetore
Indiana 71-63. Adding the marginsih each game, we see that in-
diana is 159 points superior to Grinnell. Now add last weeks 73
points to the 159, and it is obvious that 1ndiana is 237 points bet~
ter than Indiana. This is somewhat confusing to me. Could anyonei
straighten this matter unﬁsAnyosugggstlans will be appreciated. 1

To clarify the doubts in some persons‘ minds about why 1’
called swimming and wrestling minor sports: Neither of these at‘
tracts nearly the number of fans which attend, basketball 9r font—i
ball games. Thus fewer newspaper readers 'Wlll read wrestling and
swimming stories than basketball stories; consequently irom a
journalist's point of view, sthey anustsbe ranked minor.

After n'iissin three of tour predictions last week, one percent—‘
age has droppedio 17 oi 22 (77.3%), and I’m almost scared to open
my big mouth again. But here goes. The cagers will beat Law»
rence, lose to Coe, beat Iowa Teachers; the swimmers Will swamp
both Cornell and R0112; and the wrestlers will beat St. Olaf by

one point.

 

Coe Malmen Edge
Pioneer Grapplers
In Close Contest

The Gl'lnnell grapplers lost
a hotly contested and very im-

portant meet to Coe last Satur-i

day by the narrow margin of
15—14.

The meat was decided in the
last match when Tom Marshall,

moved up from 177 to heavy-‘

weight, was pinned by his much
heavier opponent. This gave the

Kohawks the five points they,
total to

needed to boost their
16.

In the 123 pound class, Lo-
gothetis (G) was pinned by
Robertson, While Johnson (G)
won by a decision over Hcland-
dar in the 130 divisin. Ceuve
(G) and Budlang (G) lost to
Roberts and Suttle on the 137
and 147 pound classes, respec-
tively. Savage (G), wrestling at
157, took a decision over Lenz
as did Walker (G) over Rosen-
berg in the 167 division.

Grinnell went ahead Hell
when Coe forfeited the 177 lb.
class. Marshall, usually wrest—
ling in that spot, was moved up
to heavyweight. Unable to with
stand the great weight disad»
vantage oi the heavier Ko-
hawk man, Nemer (C) finally
pinned Marshall, thus winning
ithe meet tor the Kohawks.

Two more hurdles are in line
for the Grinnell swimming team
within the next week as they
travel to Mt Vernon tomor-
row for a meet with the Cor—
nell Rams and then play host
to Rolla School ot Mines troin
Missouri in the Grinnell pool
next Wednesday.

This year is apparently a
lean one tor the Rams, while
Rolla's max-men are rated as
“above average."

Cornell is led by its captain,
Bob Cutler, an excellent sprint-
er and distance man.

The Pioneers, who handily
whipped North Central last
Saturday, the same team that
drubbed Cornell the day be-
fore, are confidently holllng
for a pair of victories in these
next two dual meets.

Irv Simone, Grimell swim~
ming coach, says, “I am Very
well pleased with the high
Spirit, hard Work and good at»
titude that the boys have dem-
onstrated all year."

The Pioneers will probably
depend on the same man that
have previously carried the
load this Year: Bill and Tom
Eejna, Ban-y Lawrenoe,
Howie Bunyan, Walter Brag-
don, Pete Vassllakos and Joel
Stubhs.
