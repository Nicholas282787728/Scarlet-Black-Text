I A1 Pfaender, tackle on the
'Grinnell football team, has
,played outstanding ball in his
:first two games this year, and,
shows promise of even better
things to come.

”He's a whale of a good foothalli
,playcr," agreed Coach John'
Pfitsch, “and he’s had to do it
by sheer hard work and determ—
ination, because he had no high
school experience at all. He has‘
,made himself into one ot the
istrongcst and most dependable
lineman on the team.” That
word “determination" is the,
secret of Al’s success, for the
big 195-pounder puts everything
the has into every play.

A1 is quite optimistic about
the team's chances for the rest
of the season. “Lawrence will
be our toughest game," he says.
“I think we'll really be up for

will over the Redmen. _
Gl‘lnnell has Its turn to be Idle
