Pioneer Cagers Finish Schedule
At Lawrence, Ripo

The Pioneer cagcrs face their
final foes of the 1952-53 season,
_Ripon and Lawrence, in two
road games this weekend. The
Pioneers wiil be at Lawrence {07
night and at Ripon tomorrow.

These games loomed large
for Grinnell until Coe blasted
‘ the Pioneer’s title hopes last
week. The pressure is off now
and Grime]! can lose two and
still take third. Only Carleton
still has a chance to tie league
leading Cornell for first.

The Pioneers are expected to
take these final two games on
the basis of the season records
of the squods. Lawrence has
won five and lost four in con-
ference competition. Ripon hasn’t
fared as well, winning three as
against six losses. The Pioneers
at present are in the third spot
behind Cornell (10-2) and Carle—
ton (8.2) with a seven and three
record.

The cagén‘s’ biggest obstacle
will be beating their biggest
jinx—road games. The Pioneers
didn’t lose once in eight home
games. but they have dropped
six out of eight on the road.

Along with this problem, they
will be faced by a scrappy Law:

To Coe's Yearlings‘

Gtinnell's freshmen cogers
suffered their second defeat of
the season last Friday, losing to
Coe, 61-56, at Cedar Rapids.

Starting at a slow pace, Grin—
nell found itself on the short
end of a 21-11 first quarter
score. By halftime, Coach E. G.
Booths hoopsters had narrowed
the deficit to 33-30.

Exceptional shooting by for»
ward Dick Kirkpatrick enabled
the yearlings to

Captaining‘ this season's swim-
ming squad is Bob Ross. But
that is only one of Bob's fortes.

In addition to his activities in
the pool he has used his tal-
ants and energy in managing
the business end of the Cyclone
staff, plus keeping the Board of
Religion solvent as its treasur-
er, and being a member of the
Langan house council, Bob has
done these things in spite of the
fact that he was born without a
right leg.

Bob came out for swimming
two years ago. Previously, he
had never swum competitively.
As a recreation he began pad-
dling around at an early age
near his home in Mount Ayr,
Iowa.

As captain of this season’s
tank team Bob won his first
collegiate meet. That was
against Augustana in Decem-
ber when he captured the 440-
yard free style event.

Last season in the conference
meet at Knox he pushed him—
self to a fifth place position in
the 440 free style race. The Pie-
neers took runner~up spot in
that week-end competition.

Since joining the varsity team

Bob Ross Cap’rains Swimmers
To Leading Conlender Role

‘ .a.
Bob has cut his time clown by
a wide margin, To date one

,minute, 12 seconds have been
lsliced from his original 440
‘yard effort, while he reduced
his time in covering the 220
yard stretch by 45 seconds.

, Simone’s comment about Bob:
"‘He‘s a very determined young
man. He works hard, and is
constantly improving his times.
Boh sets a wonderful example
for the rest of the squad, for
not only is he this year’s caps
tain, but he handles other rev
‘sponSlble jobs on Campus"

_ With an intent of going into
.his dad’s banking business
when he receives his diploma,
iBob is maioring in economics.

i “I've always liked swimming,”
Bob remarks. “It's a lot of fun
and keeps one in shape. Besides,
traveling to different schools is
‘an interesting experience."

When conference time comes'
tat Carleton next week-end cap—
tain Bob Ross will again be ”on
his mark" and ready to travel
ithrough a most familiar medium
drying to bring the conference
title to Grinnei! for the first
time in its history.

Swim hard, Bab.
