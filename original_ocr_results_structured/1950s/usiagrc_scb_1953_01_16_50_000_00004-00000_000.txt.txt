Grinneil's Go’r Anoiher Crowi;

This One's A Baske’rball Slar

by Ron stringer

If Grinnell had an aged regis»
trar it is certain that the name
of “Crawl” would strike a 1:-
miliar note. You see — with the
CrDWl family of Council Bluffs
this school is almost a tradition.

The father, Harry Crowl, at-
tended classes here earlier in
the century. Next came his
daughter, Doris Jeanne, who
lived on campus at the end. of
the last war. NOW the third
Crowl, Bud, is in attendance and
is a north Younker sophomore.

Bud, as he prelers to be called,
came to Grinnell trom Abraham
Lincoln high a year and a half
ago. He was an above average
student with a world of interest
in basketball and a high school
record to prove his proticiency.

in prep school he made the
varsity squad in his sophomore
year. His senior year saw him
playing center on the squad
which won the Omaha-Council
Bluﬁfs Inter-City basketball con»
ference crown. Bud received all-
state recognition for his playing
both his junior and senior year,

Bud’s sister, Doris Jeanne, set
a fast pace for him. She was

‘ crowned Centennial Homecoming
Queen in ‘1946, Then chosen
League Board president that
spring.

John Piitsch, cager mentor tor
the Pioneers, can assure you,
however, that Bud will main-
tain the pace set for him, especA
ially on the Darby floor.

“Bud is a fine man to have
on the squad," Pfitsch comment-

. ed. “He‘s developed a somewhat
unusual style of play. He's the
kind that proves his worth as
a ballplayer under game condir
tions. You talk to anyone on the
teams we've faced and they’ll

 

tell you he’s tough.

“in high school his team used
the tastebreak otlense, not stop
ping to setup patterns. Bud was
at his best on individual break-
aways.

“He had to make a transition
to Grinneil methods,
learning iast. You‘ll notice Buds
a very fine natural l'ebounder.
He reels right at home under the
boards e that's what he did u
lot or in high school. He also
does consistent shootingiii close.”

His ability is best illustrated
perhaps in the fact that he was
one of three ireshinen who made
the varsity squad and the only
one to receive regular starting
assignments and a varsity letter
last season,

This summer he and his broth»
er, Dick, plan to build a house.

”We’re serious about it,” Bud
said as he explained how they
were going to manage this un-
usual task. “Dad’s helping us
find the land, but we're going
to draw up the plans and 5“.
pcrvise the constructionithen
we’ll sell it."

Brother Dick is now ﬁrst-
string center at Bud’s alma innv
ter and hopes to enroll at Grin—
nell next fall,

When the aged registrar learns
that Dick has arrived she‘ll mut-
ter, “Not another one." 'But. if
she has ever read the sports

pages she should continue, ”Wet

Maimen Lose Two
Last Week, Faced
Cornhuskers Today

After winning their opening
meet against Augustana beiorc
Christmas, Grlnnell’s grapplers
returned from vacation and wore

promptly trounced by two iar

superior squads.

Veteran packed Cornell and
Iowa ‘State handed the matinen
decisive deieats 3L3 and ado
respectively, in Darby gym last
Saturday and Tuesday.

The Pioneers made a good
showing in both defeats, but it
wasn’t much more than a good
workout loi always tough Corr
nail, and even stronger lowii
State.

Carl Couve was the standout
tor Grinnell as he grabbed the
only points against Cornell.
Notching a quick three points in
the iirst period, he outlasted Jim
Claypool oi Cornell to post the
only win of the day on a de
cision.

But the rest of the Scarlet and
Black grunt and groaners had
tough sledding as Ed H0, 123;
Ken Wright, 147; John Uzodima.
157; Tom Marshall, 177; and
Phil Hartsxk, heavyeweight, all
were pinned-in their matches.

In the lowa State match the
Pioneers found even tougher
going as they failed to cop a
single match in any weight di—
vision, and only Carl Couve
could stay the time limit as

can always use him if he plays'the remainder of the Grinnell

basketball like Bu ”
