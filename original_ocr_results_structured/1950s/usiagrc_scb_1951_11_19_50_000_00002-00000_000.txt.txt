If the—Shoe Fits...

There have been Complaints, and valid ones, about the
language used by (lrinnull lnell as tlley lille up for meals ill
('tiu‘les lounge. The recent popularity ol‘ such book as “The
Naked and the Dead” and “Fl-om Here to Eternity” mayl

account for this.

Whatever the excuses, llousenlothel's and other femi-

nine gilests, including- the mothers and sisters of student

are being enlbarl‘zssed daily. Adopting: the Vernacular ol'
lnngshm'emell is hardly becoming

\lork ill their entire lives.

To the editors of the SBLB‘

1 was walking through the li'
brary y this week, musing
to inyscil, when I hcard small
voices raised in a plain‘iiii tone,

“Here we arc, with covers
warped. pages soggy and stuck
together, our printing Sinudged
and our piCtul'Cs stained. And all
because somebody was neglects
ful oi us too long. and someone
else was stupid enough to lorgct
that we need a root over our
heads, just as others do,

“We know thcrc will be a
nicc ncw sc cnca library tor some
oi our 1 ends, and that some
day our co ms, the music manu-
scripts and records “’ill have
a new house But our only con»
solatlon is that Students and
icachcrs still like to Come to takc
us out, or just to browse among
our stacks.

“But pcoplc don't like us when
we’re likc wc arc now. Many
of us arc ruincd. and othcrs will
never look nice again. So, please
may we havc at least a cool

Lat , more lmprc ed than
surp iscd by this boo sh com.

campus, wondering whcrc our
new library will be built.

signal nuns, nonm-

litscli, but only those aspects oi
it which have tcndcd to placc
it in a position or power OVEI'
our academic his.

we icci that Grinncll is expe-
rieneing on a small scale. a
problem which is serious on an
international scale, a college
problem which has worldwide
implications. These are the in-
cidtmts, the objections, our sug~
gestlons.

1. The military program. and
its leaders have come to eon-
sider Grinnch college as only
a subsidiary to the ROTC pr -
gram, All other phases of col-
lcgg lite arc rclcgatcd to a
minor position.

For example. we cite the
change in the date tor the ROTCt
review, Finally, the date “as?
set ior Saturday a date which
had been reserved for months
ioi trcshincn hell day, a collcge
tradition. But the College pians‘
wcrc disregarded tor the n‘illlr',
tary.

Another mplc was

and cthcis accomplished noths
ing because oi tew attending,
oiicc more the academic his
was disregarded lor the milir
tat-y.

We beiici-c that thcrc should
bc time for every department
to eal‘l') out its functions, and
no dcpartnient should usc an 1
other’s time; and we strcss their
the ROTC should be trcatcd
lust likc, and not any better
than any other dcpartnicnt.

2. Thc quality oi teaching in
the air science courses leaves
much to be deSlred. Lectures
are uninspiring, and in most
cascs incrcly a reading or texts
boo, matcriai. Those teachers
have the status of instructors
at Gi-innell, and should live up
to the standards set for Grins
ncll instructors,

The mcn taking these courses
are collcgc men who wcrc high

I don't kilo“ where to beg'
this week. The freshmen have
lust pl'uvttlcd us \\'ltl'\ a hilarious
day 0t watching them turn blue
with the Cold,

Why don‘t we wait a while
and let it really freeze up I'll
bet we could actually kill a few
oi lhenl oft and maybc even
make Lite magazine again.

1 enjoyed watching the young—
cr upperclassmen standin g
around in groups in trontolllre
bookstore with phoney gr s,
jabbing each other with bony
elbows and saying. "Isn’t this
a riot?" It sure was.

I've always wondered where
Shriners, Rotari‘dns, Legionai
Elks. Eagles Lions, and the like,
got their training tor those coir
ventions they have every year.
Mcn can't make such _pcricct
fools of themselves without

me that all three are available

I’ve been knocking Grinncll
girls all semester and it seems
that the administration is ii--
naily paying heed to my words
oi wisdom. I've mainta got
right along that our ladiesweiet
at times, inclined towardfl‘owzi»
ness Steps are being taken to
correct this, ‘.

Our girls are not allowed iii
wear ankle socks into the dim
ing room for the evening meal
it is reasoned that if they are
torccd to remove their socks
they will be forced to wash
their hands As long as they’ve
got the water running they mav
even wash their faces and nor s.

But, as is so oiicn the ease.
the plan has backfired, The
ladies don't remove their socks
until they got to Main hall.
Thcn they hang them neatly on
hooks in the cloak room, lcall
that ingenuity.

I caught a couple oi basket-
ball players doing a strange
thing the other night. There
were about five of them. plus
a tell‘ swimmers and wrestlers,
all seated in a circle laughing
at tops of their gusty lungs.
Thcy sounded like a pack oi
Hudson seals barking at the
zockccpcr for more herring.
But. that wasn’t it at all

They cxpiained they were res
they were rehearsing their aths
letes’ laugh; now that the grid
scasou is over thcy have taken
it upon thcntsclrcs to provide
the cuteriainmcnt at. the uni ii
All 1 can so. is that theyvc
got a darn long way to go be
fore they even approach the
real thing.

A troupe oi our tinest marks-
men took a walk in thc col-in
holds the other day, They in-
cluded a certain colonel, sevr
el'al other air iorcc men include
ing the coach oi the rifle team,
our dean of men, and a low
ircshmcn. Total bag for the ens
tire group: 1 rabbit (shot by
one or thc ircshmcn, oi courscl.

telling this, because it is the‘

can any one or those men have,

shows obv‘iolisly so little prep»

little knowledge or interest
that he presents the German‘
