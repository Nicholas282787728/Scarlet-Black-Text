A strange thing happened at
Cornell college. It could be ex—
plained in terms of cultural
admiration, ic, admiration of
Crinnell culture: but it was
probably caused by something
more like a shortage of copy or
advertising The Cornell college
newspaper (no one seems to
know the real name) has print—
ed and-misprinted two of the
5853‘s. two~weeksold columns
With seine mixing in or loose
type (the linotype man must
have been sleepy) and some
critical footnoting. ‘

The two ouoted journalists
‘ Irons the 5&1; are grateful for
the extended coverage and
hope thzt it will continue.
They believe it to he the tirst
step toward national syndica<
tion. it subscription to an 5&3
column is desired, wire Gar-
land DeNelsky, manager 01
58:3 syndications. There is a
slight charge.

The fine old custom of lands
mark piltering has been reviv—
ed. The enthusiasts of Langan
hall ivho did such.a fine job
at Cornell over semester break
deserve credit. Who knows,
.next time it may be a plaque, a
cannon or even a prof This
time it was a sign.

, The Cornell kids who tod-
dled down to watch’their
rather individualistic basket—
bdll team (known as the Five

Mad Gunners) were.surprised
,to see it. They sent some or
their hired musclemen ovor
recover it, but that failed, Fi -
ally, when the game was over
and a solemn ceremony tor
-roturning the sign was in nio-
~tion the five Mad Gunners
attempted to recover by force
what was being given back to
them. Even that failed.

The Grinnell' sign is still in
its place, thanks to the block
of concrete it is set in. God
knows wheie the Cornell sign
is. A note of caution: When
future souvenirs are removed
'from the Cornell campus; be—

. ware of wrestlers.

Riding the 3-11 to Chicago for
,the first time i was not par-
ticularly horrified to see the
countless, acres of slum houses,
with the ragged children, the
blue—faced mothers and the pie:
faced fathers. I was not even
sickened when the train bisected
a sleeping drunk, or when a
young hoodlum biasted my
window with his zip gun,

It was when thousands of
young men (they were all
clothedirom the same store
and equipped with those
smiles Norman Rockwell dee
signsl bounded onto the train
that I began to tremble. They .
were all of the same hdtch,

They were smiling like idiots.

One oi them sat down beside
me. He was, typical. His face
was expiessive Whenever peo—'
ple were looking it was wreaths
ed with smiles The rest of the
time it resembled a relieved
flower sack. He talked to me.

The man told me that Jack
Lesconlie is the true “pmfit”
of God and went on to prove
with six insipid slogans that i

To the Editor:

In the 5&3 iast week it was
stated that the Student Council
unanimously approved the allo—
cation of $605 to KGRW. There
was‘ one dissenting vote: mine.
There should have been more.
Indeed, there would have been

more,'had $605 not been con-
sidered a trifle, relative to the
thousands 1(th has received
in the past.

I cannot understand why a
rock‘n‘ rollin' radio station, a
wholly foreign element on a lib-
eral ai‘tS/ campus, should be
permitted to exist._Nor can I
understand why the Student
Councﬂ is incapable of doing
anything constructive with its
play—money. Perhaps all finan-
cial matters should be taken out
or its hands.

oiir suggestion is to open
the dormitories to both sexes
at least one afternoon and
evening each weekend on a
triai basis. Allow the students
this privilege to display their
ability to handle maturely un-
supervised rcsponsihility. And,
if the esteemed Grinnell stu
dent proves too young, too
immature, too irresponsible to
handle such responsibility
without an excess of prob.
lems, then it will be logical
to deny him this liberty.

It, on the other hand, it is
found that we are capable oi
approaching this freedom with
integrity, it
the program might be expandr
ed in accordance with student
opinion until finally we live in
a mature, adult community
where we are held responsible
for our own action and where
we develop to a level of social
maturity commensurate with our
level of academic excellence.
