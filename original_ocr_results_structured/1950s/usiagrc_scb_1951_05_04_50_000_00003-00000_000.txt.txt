Do you think that bachelor
professors could be satisfactor-
ily substituted for women houses

or another until I have had the
opportunity to consider all the
possible ramifications or such
a plan,”

Sally Morris, Mears freshman:
“By all means, yesl"

Dick Landjs, Dibble junior:
“Yes, if they were ‘trained' to
some extent before they began "

Janaan Wilts, Mears senior:
“Yes, I think they could. That’s
, all I can say. I don’t want to

commit myselt.n

Ken Wright, Clay sophomore:
“I certainly do! There would
be more competence, more
authority, and more respect."

The above question was sub—
mitted by Jim Wallrich, Smith
senior, and was judged best by
Charmayne Wilke and Diane
Powell, Loose hall juniors, and
Peter Carlton, Chesterfield rep—
resentative on campus: For

his ancient benny — but he has modem ideas on testing cigarette

mildness! He‘s tried every “quickie” cigarette test in

the book — and they’re not fooling him one bit! He knows for dang-sure that

cigarette milclness can’t be determined by a cursory Sniff or a single, quickly-

dispatched puﬂ. He doesn’t have to go back to school to know that~

there is one real test — a test that dispels doubt, ﬁxes fact.

It’s the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,

which asks you to try Camels as,your steady smoke—on a pack-

aiter-pack, day-afterrday basis. No snap judgments needed.

After you’ve enjoyed Camels~ and only CamelSm for
30 days in your “T-Zone” (T {or Throat, T for Taste), we
believe ySu’ll know why . . .

More People Smoke' Camels
‘ than any other cigarette!
