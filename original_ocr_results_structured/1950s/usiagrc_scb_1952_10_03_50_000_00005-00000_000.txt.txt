Tomorrow most Grinnell stur
dents will get their first look at
the 1952 Pioneer football team.

The mostrimpressive statistic
on the Scarlet and Black so far
- has been bail handling. In the

first two contests against what
are probably the best teams in
the conference, Grinnell has not
fumbled on a bandoff from
quarterback Marv Clein to a ball
carrier.

emphatically declared.

“Pete” claims he loves his
work as ‘lt makes you stay

chair with a big smile and
closed the interview by saying,
”I’ve never worked with a nicer
group of boys than the ’52

a tough break offensively as he
was Grinnell’s leading ground
gainer in the Coe game before
being injured. The good line
play from reliable Terry Ellis
will also be missed.

According to Piitch, the Pio-
neers are in fair shape and
team spirit is high. In speaking
or the game Pfitch said, “if
we play as well as the spirit
is among team members, we
should win."

Having lost the first two
games of the season, the Pio-
neers are definitely underdogs
in tomorrow’s contest. Both
their games were played away
from home and against the two
top teams in the . conference,
Coe and Lawrence. Nevertheless,
the ‘Pioneers are driving to start ‘
on a successful season with a
victory over Knox.
