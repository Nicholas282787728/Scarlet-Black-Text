Football Season
Ends Tomorrow
For Grinnellians

Grinnell's gridiron Pioneers
will close their season tomor-
row against Macalester college
lat St. Paul, Minn.

, Both squads will wind up an
unsuccessful campaign, having
Won but one game apieceu
a result the game must be con..
sidered a tossup.

Pioneer coach John rfitsch,
however, thinks that Grinnell
is “going to win another ball
game and extend its winning
‘streak‘ to two games.” A Grin.
nell victory would avengclnst
Year’s 7-0 setback at the hands
of the Scots
Little
alester except that its only win
was over Simpson, 7-6. Among
the Scots losses were defeats
b‘y Carroll, which beat Cornell,
and Hemline.

Macalester uses an imbalanced,

single wing attack featuring a
power offense.

To ofisct this, Hank Brown
has been trying to sharpen
Grinnell’s offense in drills
this week. The Pioneer de—
fense has shown considerable
improvement in the last two
games against One and Cor-
nell.
inght Grinnellians will be
seeing their last college action
in tomorrovas contest. They in.
