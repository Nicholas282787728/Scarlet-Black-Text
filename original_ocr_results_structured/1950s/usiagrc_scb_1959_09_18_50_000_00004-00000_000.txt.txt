Freshmen's Old Glory Ends Here

For the first time ili several years there was little men-
’tion of grades, test scores, and “the smartest class yet to
enter Grlnliell" at the mass meeting at freshmen.

 

However, there was a reading of the record and as
usual the statistics were superficially impressive.

Almost one»fifth of the freshmen held class offices in
high school. Half of theln participated ill dramatics, debate
and ol'atorv. Half 01' them uere either editor or business
manager of one of their high school publications. Severity
of the men received athletic letter awards in high school.
The freshmen. according to President Bowen’s statistics
were ”an \ctive. intelligent, alert group of students with
much init tivc.”

Unfortunately, very little‘at Grinnell is dolie by mass
statistics. Progress, achievement, and contribution is made
by students and faculty working: together and independent-
ly to bring,r about a thousand or more desired ends and goals,

Perhaps we Cali’, along uith President Bowen, respect
the statistics for what they are and congratulate the fresh-

men on their past record. The freshmen can certainly be
proud of their record. But as theV will soon learn if they

have not already done so, the college soon grows tired of;
statistics and asks for proof of the alertness and initiative‘

of the new students.

President Bowen expressed the situation. “Grinneil is
no country club. There will be hard work. There will be
times of frustration and discouragement when the students
are fed up with the work. But advice and help on an adult-
to-adult level is plentiful and there is no college which al-
lows greater freedom in which the student can solve his
problems, and express himself and his ambition."

As a result of experience we must agree. Now it is all
up to the freshmen.

Open-Open-Open House

This week the administration made its policy public on
the further experimentation with the “opeihopen house”
policy that was started last semester, Most of the articles
\i'ltlllll the policy seem to be borne out of liberal thinking
with one notable exception.

It reads: “Members of the faculty and administrative
staff should be free to visit student rooms during these
hours, and such visits should not be considered intrusions”

To our way of thinking- this is escaping the issue
through ambiguity. The whole question of the “open-open
house" arose because students realized that the college had
not provided adequate facilities for them to be alone with
one of the opposite sex; not to be provided with a den of
iniquity, just a place to be alone.

Now just exactly what is meant when the policy states:
“should be free to visit l . ‘7” Is a college professor e

pected to devote a Sunday afternoon imposing himself onJ

couples who wish to be alone?

Whether or not a student should consider these visits
an intrusion seems to us to be entirely up to that student,
Some may appreciate a Visit but why should a student nec-
essarily welcome someone whom he does not care for or
may even violently dislik into his room? Anyone should be
granted the right to decide whether or not someone is ill-
truding’ upon him.

The administration made itself Very clear by stating

that the doors should be completely open and this is in their

r. But a statement of policy, especially on an issue that
' created such controversy as this should be very ex-
plicit, should not need further explanation and above all,
should not be ambigious.

President Howard H. Dos
well, speaking. at the con -
:cation held last night in
H e r r i c h chapel, discussed "
“The College as a Commun-
itv.”

The pic ’dcnt said that‘great
colleges arc distinguished by
the kind oi community they cre-
ate and thc spontaneity and al-
,most indeflnable nspccts oi this

lcommunity.

He stressed that “tllc i-e-
speiisibility to achieve a orear
tive college community is par-

tial college like Griiiiieii."
Too bl'tcn, the president said,

advocated on "negatlv " grounds

At this point Bowen posed
two qilcstio
characteristics of an ideal c01-
lcgc community?" and “What
could lie (lone practically this
year 1.0 realize the ideal at
Grinllell‘l’”

“The fundamental allegiance
of the college community ls to
lrutlL” the president said. "The
student of the ideal
community learns to rare about
ideas, is inspired
bcst energies to the search for
truth, including the search for
a philosophy that will give dis
rcciion and energy to his life."

The president xpressed his
beiiel timt oriiinell students
respect learning and that the
faculty is not faced with an
anti—intellectual attitude. He
said, however, that he believes
that "we fall short as creating
an atmosphere that is charged
with intellectual excitement .in
which people care deeply
about ideas."

i

was not creating this atmoss,
pliere by giving a speech buti
that it could be achieved “onlyi
if there is abundant informal,
discussion of ideas among stuﬁ
dents." i

"Discussion stimulates'
thought; it sharpens intellec-
tunl resourcelulness through
examination oi varying points
of View, it contributes toward i
finding the truth, and it is
interesting." ,

“Discussion gi-ows natui-aiiy‘

“thinking of goals, attachment
