Gary Hayes. DIE-campus social

the bus 00 C09 and the number
of people who have asked about
Ia similar one to Cornell make
me quite optimistic about an
even bigger trip in the future.
The cost at the trip will really
be quite reasonable. Tickets on
the chartered Greyhounds will
be $2.90 each, which is almost
a dollar less than a regular
round trip ticket to Cedar nap-
ids" ' . |
