Freshman Views Prepping

_ Because of the amount of timely letters in this week’s
issue, he shall not Lake an editorial stand this week. We
are printing below a letter received this Week from a fresh-
man. We shhll have more to Say concerning prepping and
the freshman’s letter, ill future issues.

_ This discussion of prepping is significant lor one reason—it was
written by a prep. who can bcst reveal how the prepping ”shoe”
did or did not pinch,

This prep agrees completely- with the charge oi last week's
prepping editorial, that prepping is a very childish institution;
but it is much easier to criticize than to improve or replace ades

. quately.

Speaking as a prep, i tool that a good bit of the criticism
in last week’s editorial is based on iacts which do not consistent-
ly prove true, and that the alternate program presented would
be less workable and much less effective than the onc in current
use, provided that the result desired is an appreciation or Grin—
nell tradition and hail spirit

What we win with ease we often value too lightly. “For the
first six weeks he (the prep) is denied these rights and duties.”
For six weeks he Longs to take part, and when the ordeal is over
he tends to eagerly and proudly assume his duties and exercise
his rights which he would otherwise have taken tor grantcd.

“Preppingis only successful with those who don’t need it,"
last week's editorial claims, going on to say that the quiet prep is
made even more remote from his hallsbrothcrs by the rigors oi
prepping.

Why then is it that the most timid preps in the hall, by tak-
ing the triivail oi prepping iii a manly way (I have not heard

of an incident where this was not the case), have gained the
respect or the upper-classmcn, who otherwise would have hardly
known their names? it is also interesting to note that several of
these same preps have or their own tree will decided to make
paddles for the upperclassinen who have most continually
plagued and pounded them.

Converse , the overconﬁdcnt, boastful trcshman tends to be
restrained, even mellowed by indignitcs improscd through prep»
ping, Of course, iacts stated in the last two paragraphs may not
be without exception, but they do at least show that the contrary
:plnlons expressed last week could not be 100% or even generally
rue, »

The alternativc plan which last week’s editoriahst afiel'ed is
completely impractical. Having rightly complained about the waste
of study time imposed by prepping, he makcs the mistake of
suggesting an educational program, requiring the learning oi ma»
terial, probably written.

Though most preps feel cramped tor study time it seems
that a breather is necessary, or at least one will be taken. A
prepping activity can serve as such an “escape from the hooks."
Would it not he illogical to pile on oven more “book" work, such
as the study of hall and college history, which woud be or little
value if the spirit were lacking?

Such a program is not distinctive and much less memorable.
If the choice is between this and our present prepping dogma, I
am sure that most preps will gladly assume the position in favor
or the paddle.

During this last week, at the
suggestion of a couple of south
campus malcontents, I tried to
find out all I could about the
way in which the student activ-
ities fund is distributed by the
various organs oi women’s gov-
ernmenl:

it was hinted that I might
discover something oi a scanda—
lous nature to satisiy those peo—
ple who read this column hoping
that they will learn of deep,
dark, frightening nightrtlme sec—
rets of the Grinnell “under-
world." ‘

Well, it isn't as exciting as
all that. As a matter 0f tact
the whole involved mess of
women’s government should
probably win a Nobel prize
for monotony,

But i did uncover one appro—
priation that is rather startling
irom the sldndpolnt of the idea
‘lehlnd itia part of the socia-l
tund oi south campus goes to
buy Christmas presents for
housemothei-s.

This guarantees. of course,
presents of equal value for all—
quitc democratic. trom their-
Viewpoint, but it strikes me as
a rather cold, calculating mis-
carriage of the idea of gift-giv-
ing, South campus plans for the
prcscnt ahead of timc just like
a businessman would make an
appropriation for company Sta»
tioncry or for towels in the em—
ployeo's washroom

Perhaps those of you who
think that the plan under
mines the spirit of Christmas
or tciids to tlestruy faith in
Santa Claus could drop down
a chimney or something.

The Student Council exp- scs its gratitude and appreciation
tor your cooperation in appear g beiorc us to answer our ques-
tions ivith regard to thc linaneial structure of the college. Your
answers were helpiul in aiding our understanding of the prob~
lems you must face. _

Although the Council does understand your position and the
problems that-do exist, we teel that since these problems have
existed tor several yars, your explanation does not entirely Justify
the procedures of your department. we delinitely tool that there
is something more than just a labor crisis and tau by machines
behind these recurring malfunctions. _ _ ‘ p _

The duties of your department, as we see it, include delinite
obligations to the student body of theeollege. The prompt dist-
tribution or funds to the student auditoi and to student employees
is a primary concern to us and up to this _mc,_there has been a
definite lack of coordination and cooperation _in these‘matters,
Prompt action in recent weeks does not explain chronic delays
in the past, ‘ . _ ,

As the financial organ of a business corporation, your office is
obligated to periorm its duties with prompt citicien This has
obviously not been accomplished due to an apparen ack of in—
tercst and concern on your part for the needs antl wishes of the
students. A more interested and concerned attitude combined with
incrcascd cooperation would be a great help in eliminating the
present incfiiciencics. _ _ _ ~

We sincerely hope that an increased si -it of cooperation pill
develop in the [titurei Again, we thank you for appearing before
our group. _

Recently the eyes of the
world have been focused on the
Suez and Hungary. The Hun-
garian uprisings particularly
have demonstrated that the will
to he tree lives in the hearts of
peoples the world over. it is
particularly significant that the
rebellions were led by Hungar-
ian students.

letter Irnm the Universil)’ of

“Vedncbﬂay Nehru interceﬂed.
I\’[y only question is this: IS
this all we want to do?

I think not, First of all the
Council approved a letter to
Nikolai Bulganin advising him
that we were not interested in
