To You From Us

In Spite of all the powel‘S-thatrbe
Have done to make life hard, . .
(Like instituting triple cuts

And Dean Brown‘s I. D. card,

And Cutting down on evelytlling
But lights at open house)

God rest you merry, everyone.
Let’s call a two-Week truce.

With ice-cream sodas lifted high
We’ll toast the season‘s cheer;
A Many Christmas to you all,

And Happy New Year!

by Brute Cole

Every year, Al Capp and 1
use our newspaper space to
wish our personal friends a
Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year. This year, however,
i managed to latch onto some
Christmas cards and I don't
,know so many people that i re—
iquire two media for expressing
lyuietide slogans.

i Thereis another side to it,
lthough. If I don’t wish certain
persons a Merry Christmas in
this space they may never have
another chance to get their
names into print. I don’t mean

It just happens to be the policy
of this newspaper to mention
as few Students’ names as pos—
‘slble.

, (rhcre is a kind of jealousy

'iconnected with this. The reports

ers on the 5&3 are just Stu-
dents like thc rest of us, and
often very inconspicuous stu—
dents, at that. Their feelings
seem to run along these lines:
“Why should we publicize every—
one else when we never get
any publicity for ourselves?"
The obvious answer is that this
is a newspaper and not the so-
cial register. But, that’s a
problem for the editors.

I‘m not jealous of anyone

S&B every week at the top of

to offend these pErsons, Mitten,

 

because i get my name in the,

this column, It's a sneaky way
to gel the job done but my
ego doesn‘t. Seem to know the

‘diHel'ence. So, here go my best

wishes for delightful
Christmas holiday to. first,
Gardiner button and Janet
Chaplin, whose persistence has
been unflagging and beyond my
powers of resistance,

I also want to include Clyde
Greene and the men of Cowles
hall who, individually and as
a group, are the funniest guys
I've ever had the curious pleas—
urc to live with. I must also
single out Bill Hamilton and
Art Heusner, my partners in
fine music.

Next on my list is the grand
lady of Cowles hall, Mrs. Whali-
nel, our maid. She is a darling
and she makes our beds every
morning except Sunday and we
all love her for it. She makes
the best divinity and fudge on
campus, except for Mr. Herbert
Prescott, but he’s been at it
longer. '

Merry Christmas to Harvey
Nixon who has been my guide
on the “scenic route" home from

a very

‘the quad. As for those priggisn

girls who insist upon drawing
their curtains every night, I
have no wishes of any kind.

Merry Christmas to Mr.
Kuntz, Miss Hunter, Mr. Gru-
her, Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Simone,
stern disciplinarians and hard
graders, but fine persons, all of
them.

Finally, Merry Christmas to
the Haines Hall I-lellers, who
are the loveliest girls on cam-
pus and have been for the past
two years. especially the girls

on third, on the west side.
Happy New Year, too.
