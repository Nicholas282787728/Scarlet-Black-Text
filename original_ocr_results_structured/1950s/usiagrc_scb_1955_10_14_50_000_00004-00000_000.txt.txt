Confidential

The past week has seen the old collegium buzzing

with rumors about the Black
erroneous.

In the first place, the Black Friars is not a new oi"
ganization. This year is the fourth year of its existence.
It grew out of a senior colloquim in 1952. It was Composed
of senior men with one underclassman,

brought the tradition back
with him as a senior and the
group has been going ever
since.

This year it boasts 'Tom
Hejna, who is the president;
Wilber Baker, secretary, Charlie
Haynes, social chairman; Dunc
Fleming, treasurer; Jim Stewart,
chaplain; and Ron Prater. Vince
Monroe, Joel Stubbs, Hod Gree-
ley, and Bob Holmes, members.
at-large.

Heina was quick to point out
that the name Black Friars does
not indicate any association
with the Friars. The name has
been used in other colleges and
was taken from that.

The group‘s purposes arq
fellowship, to solidify friend-
Ships which will never dis-
solve, aml to meet and discuss
campus and national issues in
a pleasing and friendly atmos~
pherei In the future they hope
to he joined by members or
the faculty who can add to
the discussions and to the
spirit in which they are con-
ducted. It the group is dis-
satisﬁed by an action taken
on campus, they reserve the i
prerogative to issue ii “Vote
of NorConiiidence".

Following the tradition of
eastern schools, the Black Friars
retained the English names for
the officers. Accordingly, Heina
is the Lord High Exalted Im-
perial Potentate, Baker is the
Lord High Exalted Scribe, and
so on down the list.

'At the end of the year an
underclassman will be chosen to'
perpetuate the tradition.
