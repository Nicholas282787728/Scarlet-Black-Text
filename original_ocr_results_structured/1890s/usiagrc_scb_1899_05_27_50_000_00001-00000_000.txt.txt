the winner of the state ﬁeld meet
chances to be some institution
other than the State University or
Grinnell and for the ﬁrst time also
the wearers of the maltose cross
have been compelled to take third
place as the reward of their hard
labor.

It was a good day for the meet
and the crowd which thronged the
grand stand and bleachers early
in the aiternocn, proved beyond
doubt that more interest was taken
in this. the tenth annual meet at
the I. I.C.A. A.. than in any pre
vious state meet. All of the Cole
ieges were well represented. and
the Des Moines people seemed to
be nearly as much enthused as
the students themselves.

The meet was run off with ex
ccllcrit speed.
mittce had everything arranged
for so that Referee Stone was not
compelled to delay any event.

Yesterday morning when it he-
came known that Holland would
compete, the enthusi lrom

their chances oi winning were
small, but nevertheless both learns
went into the meet with the den
termination to do their best.

Six new records were the result
of yesterday's meet. Three were
made on the track while the re-
maining three were in ﬁeld events.
