REV. J. B. KOEHNE.

The Nazarene Lecturest

Theannouncementof thiscourse
came quite unexpectedly to stue
dents and townspeople alike, but
the interest throughout has been
manifest and sustained. Mr.
Koehne is an orator of striking
personality and great dramatic
power. so that the most we can
hope to accomplish in the iollow-
ing necessarily brief abstracts of
his lectures. is to give our readers
some slight conception of his line
oi thought.

MrJKoehne was brieﬂy intro
duced by Mr. Vittiim, and he
opened with an elaboration of the
familiar but impressive compari-
son of the ocean with human life.
Man comes forth on the earth
struggling with want. Woman is
with him and the family is instir
tuted. Familiesuniteandexpand,
iorming tribes. Man ﬁnds an ens
emy in his iellows, and nations
are born. He adorns his rude hut
with a leaty bough, and art is born.
Intellect encounters the query [or
a ﬁnal cause, and religion is born.
Science seeks the existence of
such a cause; philosophy seeks
the nature of it. and the relation
of this cause to man ts the ﬁeld of
religion. The African conceives
oi God as a great negro whose vi-
ta‘l activities are‘ in the processes
of nature. Nature religion is a
fallacy, and Africa is a proof.
From Africa to Asia is from dark
mess to dawn. China sees the
shadows of things: God is pure
nothing. Man must do no wrong,
but no positive commands are
iound. Religious soiiship was of
the emperor, the one man. China
had no poets, hence no martyrs.
Here virtue is mere external res
spectability. China is all earth,
but India is all air, or reality and
dream respectively. God in India
is all, but not yet a personality.
This is pantheism, and according
to it heaven is annihilation. End
oi existence is reached by trans
migration oi souls, and there is no
thought oi redemption nor divine

alone; India, religious speculative-
