Professor Barnes’ Chapel Talkr

Professor 5. G. Baincs lecl chap-
el yesterday, giving one oi the
best talks of the yeal. His topic
was “Practical Saintliood,” and in
a very clear and convincing mans
tler he showed that it was wrong
to su :ose that “the amount of
gr ace necessary to savejohnwould
not sufﬁce for Peter." He men-
tioned the saintly hit of the lat:
Mrs. Magoun as a case in point.
stating that she had many faults
to contend with in early life. \Ve
can all do better- with a faulty ilas
true as a stat ting point. The poor
boy and not the rich boy is tortil-
nate Even it the age ot miracles
is seemingly past, God is doing a
[at greater work than healing the
botly. The astonishing success
of the Rescue Missions is an illus-
tration. Many of the most hope-
lcss dl'unhaitls and criminals have
been changed, through Christ, into
good men and women. so it can
reasonably be bclicvccl that we
can, by exerting our will in con»
neetion with God’s power. save'
ourselves and others, and lead
successful lives,

The protessor's thoughts were
worked out ru a tie . logical way
which brought conviction to the
minds at those present.
