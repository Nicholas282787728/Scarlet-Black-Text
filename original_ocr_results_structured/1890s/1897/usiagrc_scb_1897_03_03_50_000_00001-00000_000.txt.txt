the response hour the hearers was
spontaneous and hearty.

The orchestra received encores
on the fourth number of Part I
and the second number or Part 11.,
and doubtless would have had a
recall on the last number. which
it s perhaps their most pleasing
one, had not the disturbance oi
sonic going out prevented,

The glee club seemed much
more popular in lhﬂ songs or light-
cr vein, and while "The Young
Lover” was probably their best
lillnlhcr, many others wcr o tlccol'tle

most popular piece on the pro-
