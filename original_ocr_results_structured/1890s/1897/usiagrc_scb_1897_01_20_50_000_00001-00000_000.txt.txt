Grinnell Institute.

Griunclt Institute opened the
work of the winter term, last Sat»
urday evening. with a program
that showed a greater amount of
tinre spent iii the preparation of
the different numbers than has
any program given previously
this year.

The program, aside from the dc-
bate, consisted of the news of the
preceding weeh, prepared by
Skiff; a review of Marion Craw-
ford's novel, Mr, Isaacs, and a talk
on the Struggle ot a Century tor
the Franchise. by Sargent, The
debate, on the question Re-
solved, tlrat the “Recognition of
Cuban Belligerency Rests with
the Executive Rather than Con-
gress,’ was remarkable tor one
thing.Ait showed preparation
on the part oi the speakers oi
both sides. This alone is sufﬁ-
cient to encourage the society to
believe that the members are start-

ing out this term with a determi~>

nation to do society work worthy
of the name, Messrs. Armstrong
and Noel for the al’ﬁrmative and
Hart and Richardson {or the neg
ative acquitted themselves with
credit.

The cxtemporaneous work was
another feature full of promise.

Dcnnison's talk on the B. Fay
Mills lectures, the talk by Mc-
Hose on the Monetary Confer
cnce at Indianapolis, and browns
exposition of the Athletic Confer
ence at Des Moines were all good,
but the feature of the evening
was easily the extemporancous
discussion, by Campbell and Tem-
ple, on the question of recognizing
Cuban belligerency, the former
upholding the afﬁrmative and the
latter the negative. It was the
ﬁnest extempomneous work by
undergraduates given this year.

Ples. Huff’s inaugural was full
or good points.
