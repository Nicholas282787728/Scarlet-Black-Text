FOR THE newer _ udents it is
impossible to realize what a friend
and helper Iowa College has lost
in the death of Mr. Chamberlain,
To the older students however
there are no recollections of early
college clays more pleasant than
the memories of their relations
with him who (or long had
charge of the college library,
They remember with what tear-
and trembling they ﬁrst approach-
ed his desk and with what awe
they heard his request "Let there
be less noise in the library.” But
with a closer- acquaintance all this
reserve dissapeared and they be
gan to realize that in him the stw
dents had their best tiiends, He
had awarrn personal interest in
every one ot them and knew them
better than they were aware. For
thirty years the college wasthe ob
ject oi his thought and care. In a
chapel talk given a few years ago
he said “the librarian is here to
help you; you don't
enough.” Hrs greatest regret
seemed to be that he could not do
more for the college. His inter-
est extended to the other depart»
merits of the college also, He
was often seen in the lower parts
of the campus trimming up the
trees and shruboery. working to
make the campus a place olbeanr
ty. In the spring and tall he ens
joyed walking up to the athletic
park to watch the teanrs practice;
he rejoiced in our athletic Vic»
tories and in all that related to the
progress and development ot the
College. Whatever interested the
institution became by that very
fact a part of his life. A man
who gave his lite and nearly all
that he had to further the inter
ests otthe college. Such ire was
and more to those who
him best.
