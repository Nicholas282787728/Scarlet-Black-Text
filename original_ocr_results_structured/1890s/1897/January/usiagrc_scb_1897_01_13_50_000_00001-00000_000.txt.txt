The Mills Lectures.

B. Fay Mills opened his lecr
tures last Saturday evening tvitli
the declaration that he was an
optimist. He declared that to his
mind a pessimist and an inﬁdel
were in the last analysis synony~
mous terms. The substance of
the remainder of the lecture was
as follows:

Society is not SlCliiit is grow-
ing. For eighteen hundred years
the world summed up all that it
had leulned item the Nazarene in
an emphasis upon the individual,
whence came the doctrine of hu-
man rights. But in the present
day the conception of “a greater
ruari than airy man" is beginning
to dawn upon us and we are also
passing to the larger sphere of
”human duties."

What are some of the indica-
tions of social peril? In the ﬁrst
place, the growing laxity of the
marriage tie and increasing num.
her of divorces. In some states
the proportion is 1:20 between the
number of marriages and the
number of divorces. Other indi-
cations of social peril are, the im»
proper housing of the poor, low
wages and the sweating system.
The root of the evil in Ltll these is
the [act that society is seeking
for material things.

False conceptions of real edu»
cation are even inherent in our
educational system. and in many
of otlr leading institutions wrong
ideals of life and man’s relations
in society prevail. [The speaker
cited a number of instances where
able educators had been Compelle
led to give up their positions be
cause they held and expressed
ideas repugnant to the moneyed
controlling powers]

The distribution of wealth is
largely based on the principle
“every man for himself and the
devil take the liindmbst.H Two
hundred thousand individuals own
three fourths of the wealth of the
United States. The wealth is
“captured” in many cases. Come
mon laborers are becoming mere
parts of an imlnense machineiso
much so that they also become
soulless. The standing army of
six hundred thousand men in the
the nation forin wages down to
the starvation point.

4. There is an advance being
made toward a better order of af-
fairs.

5. The church is feeling: a thrill
of practical rather than theoreti-
cal christianity.

o. A new spirit in the scienccs

In Mr. Mills' second lecttlrc,
given Monday cvening to a large
audience. he sought to answer the
question what must society do to
be saved. Scicncc, and religion
as well. said Mr. Mills. has been
content with teaching that Selfrlnt
tci'cst istheﬁrstlawofltlc. but this
is not true. sell-interest is really
the ﬁrst law of hell. To selﬁsh-
ness alone was ascribed all the
perils now threatening society.
These perils may he escaped by
applying the real law of life, which
is the law of unselﬁshness. No
one has rightly learned to live lln~
til he has eradicated selﬁshness
from his nature, and substituted
therefor tinsclﬁshncss and love.
The scientiﬁc life is the unselﬁsh
lifeia lilc having a super-abun-
dance of love to pour into those
who have but little, In order to
reform the most essential
thing is to believe in them. What
good could we not do if we would
only trust men, Mi. Mills then
applied this law of unselﬁshness
to the various social aggregates.
In the home it would bind hus-
band and wife together in holy
love with an overﬂow of love for
humanity. Children would be
taught that life is a mission. anti
the home would be used for the
beneﬁt of those less fortunate.
