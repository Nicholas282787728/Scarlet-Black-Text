growing in a steady and healthy
way for some yeais, and have
reached a stage where the ques-
tion otconti'ol by an alumni advi-
sory board is bound to come up
for consideration. This is the
plan in vogue in the great athletic
schools of the east, and its good
results there need no mention.
his bound to commend itself in
time, but the need of some such
action has become more urgent
within the present ycal'. Instead
of an alumni advisory committee
with powers co-ordinate with the
taculty and student managers.
there is a single alumni represent.
ative who has but one vote in a
committee ofsix or seven. There
is crying need otabody ot in-
ﬂuential alumni, whose views on
this question have in them an ele-
ment derived from practical ex-
perience in athletics and who will
be able to turnish a digniﬁed
check upon the chimerical fans
tasies into which the principles of
pure athletics seem prone to be~
come distorted in their applica-
tion. We hope the alumni who
are interested in the good show
ing of our teams will considel
this, and we would be pleased to
see prompt action of some kind
taken.

John V. Crum Dead.

Everyone in the west, who is at
all interested in athletics, will
learn with sincere regret oi the
death ot John v. Crum which oce
curred in Mercy Hospital at Des
Moines, Monday morning. An
operation had been periormed

tor appendicitis but the patient
failed to rally from the shock.
Mr. Crum was the ideal oi the
college athlete, sellecontrolled.
chivalmus and modest in hlsgreat~
est successes. For a great part
the friendly feeling between Grins
nell and S. U. l is the result of
his work, and we mourn his loss
equally with the Unitersity.

citizens of Gi'inncll will have the
priVilege ot listening to a most
excellently prepared debate on a
live subiect next Friday evening

loint debates have recently
come to be considered as almost
as distinctively a college altarr as
football is a college game.

All over the United States doe
hating leagues have been torrned
The practice of intercollegiate de~
bating is a most excellent one
and should be continued.

The gentlemen’s societies here
have succeeded in bringing about
a debate with our distinguished ri-
vals from the northern part or
the state, and the interest taken
in this debate Friday evening will
determine to a large extent our
future attitude with regard to his
tercollegiatc debating.

There will be considerable ex-
pense attached to this debate,
which is another strong reason
why there should be agood crowd.

Grinnell’s representatives have
been preparing tor this debate
since last December, as have the
Cornell debaters. They are all
men who stand well ill their col-
lege work and are looked up to
by the faculty and their college
mates.

Let it not be said tllat Grinnell
will support athletic contests
while they will not support des
hating contests.

The Grinnell Glee Club will
tnrnish the music oi the evening.
The judges have been selected.
They are Protcssor Loos ot the
State University, Professor l’ate
rick oi the State Normal School.

his presence.
