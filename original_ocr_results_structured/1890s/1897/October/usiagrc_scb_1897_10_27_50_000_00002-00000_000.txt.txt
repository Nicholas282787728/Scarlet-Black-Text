Qﬁhitoriul

WE WELCOME nrost he y the
return of President Gates from his
European trip to his worried position
at the tread of our institution, We
trust and believe that he comes fully
rested and prepared to take rrp the
arduous duties which are his lot. This
year of all others will add to his burr
dens, as much of the extra work in
connection with the Jubilee wrll neces-
sarily come under his direct supervis-
ion. We can as students aid him
materially in making this the best
year in the history of the college by
sincere and earnest cooperation in
every way.

WE WISH to urge rrporr the students
the importance of attending the Mass
Meeting Thursday afternoon in the
College Chapel. Enough has been
said of the object of the meeting to
make it plain to every one. Our
team must have enthusiastic support
Saturday whether winning or losing,
as many times a game is won or lost
in a very short. time, But with all
our enthusiasm let us be Courteous to
our visitors and give them the recepe
tion due to ourselves and them as
gentlemen.

Grinnell Institute.
(Cartlxmred from ﬁrs! page.)
”Grinnell Institute” may cease to be
synonymous with absenteeism. There
was a quorum present, however, and a

program of a sort, was given.

‘The ﬁrst number was a talk on
Charles A. Dana by Mr. Rew. The
subject was well chosen and well
treated by the speakeriwho dwelt
nrore at lengthﬁrn Mr, Dana’s activi-
ties as an editor and as assistant sec-
retary of war' rrnder Lincoln.

Mr. Smith in an editorial gave‘

“Eight reasons tor the adoption of
the Initiative and Referendum." This
was a very successful piece of work;
the eight reasons were logically and
lrrcidly discussed.

Two other members on the regular
program were absent. Their places

The next number on the program
was the debate. The question was,
“Resolved that the United State

nrirrirrrurn wage in certain OCClelte
tions.” The rrllirnrativc was srrstair

done good, conscientious work in
preparation, but had not properly ar-
ranged their points and gave tlrerrt a
weak presentation. The aﬂirnrative

tion of how to introduce a subject
eloquently and then proceeded to
talk all around it. delicately approach

touching it. The negative spent

guments of their opponents. The
debate was decided but upon such
slight preponderance of argument
that the public do not need to know
just how.

This report may seem a severe
criticism. But it ought to impress
upon the minds of the members just
who is being criticised. Not the
thirteen who were present, for they
certainly did what they could, but the
large majority of members who were
absent, and who will doubtless at the

next meeting have good and suﬂicierrt
