She closet] with an analysis of
Plato's real motives, gluing con-
clttsive prooi tr-oni other passages
from Plato himself and later writ-
era that he was in full sympathy
with trite poetry and believed in
its ertlalgiltg and upliiting inllue
enee. Plato himself was a poet
in sentiment and style if not in

many points which would heal
