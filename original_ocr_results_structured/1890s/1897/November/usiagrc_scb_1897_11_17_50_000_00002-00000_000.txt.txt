PRES. GATES’ opinion offootr
ball as expressed in his letter to
the [Ming/7 C/mmicll is very con-
servative as compared with those
of many other college and univer»
sity presidents. His position is
in lact rather more conservative
than any one here would have
supposed, However his view is
the honest expression ot the reel-
ing of men, who understand the
game from the spcctator's point
of View and who do not allow their
prejudices to blind their sense of
reason. Intercollegiate football
carefully supervised so as to rc-
move all possibility ot profession»
alism is in our own opinion
thoroughly commendable, but the
participation or high school and
athletic association teams,
peeially where mere boys
torced to play against iully de<
veloped men should be discourag-
ed. Of the four fatal accidents
that have occured on the football
ﬁeld this tall and which have been
so loudly heralded by the opponr
ents of the game, only one has oc-
cured to amember ofa team from
an institution ot higher learning.
Football is a college game and
should remain so. Within these,
its proper limits no valid objection
can be urged against it; but out-
side of these no one can be con-
sidered responsible except the
players themselves and their par
rents it, where untrained and irnr
mature boys are playing against
heavy odds, severe and sometimes
fatal accidents occur. Football
will endure, but the sooner the
present\vide-spread“craze”abalcs
the better it will be for all con-
cerned.

was thoroughly enjoyed.

The next number on the pro-
gram was a paper on Henry
George by Brown. This was
without doubt the best work that
has been prcscnted to the society
this year. For although the pa-

is far more important llinii mere
use of words, a hearty, generous
sympathy on the part of the
speaker with his subject. This
sort of sympathy is the germ of
all true eloquence, though there
is a great deal or oratory (it)
which lacks this important teatr
ure, Ilmembers would only see

1n extemporaneous work Marsh
spoke on Hawaiian Annexation.
He spoke with his usual readiness.
showing a considerable fund of
knowledge on the subject; but
with little emphasis. He argued
in-fnvoi of annexation, but from
the laelr or proper emphasis
it does not seem possible that
many were persuaded to take his
view of the case. There seemsto
bc a lamentable lack of the power
or persuasive speaking among our
members; it can only be because
it is not cultivated.

The question tor debate was,
Resolved, that party afﬁliation is
better than independent action in
politics, It was supported on
the aFﬁrrrlzttive by Authier and
Dennison, on the negative by Far-
ish and Layborn. All were well
prepared except Dennison, who
spoke extemporaneo-.sly, having
been appointedby the president
There was a
fair degree of spirit shown by the
speakers though not nearly
enough. The debate was ade-
quately summarized by President
McHose, He decided in favor of
the afﬁrmative.

The last event on the regular
literary program was Engelke's
report as critic. Such a report as
he gave deserves notio’ it for no
other reason than that it wasa der
parture from convention. The
critic has usually considered him-
self the oFﬁcial purveyor of white-
wash. Mr. Engelke, however, had
kept his eyes open during the
meeting and as a result had a
number of trenchant and well (lee
served criticisms.
