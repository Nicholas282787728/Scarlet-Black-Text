THE CHAMPIONSHIP of Iowa in
football (or the current season
must remain uIIawarded asno team
has won the right to the title. The
S. U. l. Quill says. “We claim the
championship.” But on what
grounds? True we were fairly
beaten by them, having previously
defeated Ames, but no amount of
argument can get around the fact
that the AmCSrIowa game resulted
in a victory for the iormer by a
score of 6 to 0. Grinnell does
nbt claim the championship al-
though comparative scores give
her the best right to do so. in
the games this season between
the ”Big Three,”
Grinnell scored .,

We do not wish to deprive Iowa
of her hardrearned laurels of vic-
tory but simply to protest against
her hurried assumption oi more
than is her due The good feel-
ing npw existing between Iowa
and Grinnell was fully exempliﬁed
by Saturday’s game, and not a
single feature of the conduct or
the gameitseltisopcntocri cpm.
Here is to a permanent continua-
tion‘of this sportsmanlike spirit in
all our contests with each other!

cn's Club of Marshalltown on
“The Place of Music in Woman’s
Education” which evidently made
a deep impression. The Time:-
chM/imn devotes a column to
the thoughts contained in the pa-
pea, and among other things says:
“The paper was aliterary gem and
clearly demonstrated that the
writer had given her subject close
study.” The Statermm-Prerrgrves
a column to it and says. “The pa
per was enthusiastically received
and compliments were showed
upon the eloquent speaker who
gave such high ideals oi woman's
work.”

combined to make the autlrencc
small indeed, but a worthy pro-
gram was carried out in Chi-est .
mathia Saturday night. Miss
Thompson and MI'. Tcllier lul'
nished the music of the evening,
the tormer a piano solo, and the
latter a vocal solo.

Douglass gave a briei talk as
an opening number. He discuss
ed very skillfully the lecture oi
the evening before as an illtrstra»
tion of the most fascinating point
in a historical View

Two humorous readings “As—
sisting a Poctess" and "She want-
ed to learn Elocution" were given
by Gardner, The Ilurnbcrseemctl
to meet a ivantrn the program and
was so‘i-cceived'by the audience.

A. Risser presented a clever
parody on "The Charge or the
Light Brigade." Thcsubject was
naturally enough the victory in
football over the farmcrs.

Mr. Tellier read an instructive
and thoughtful paper on ”New
Books," He called attention to
the dimciilty experienced in
choosing out the valuable trorn
the worthless and also to the cons
dition which gives value to a bookv
viz., that it meet a certain need
better than any other book has
done. V

Extemporaneous work was done
by Leonard and Owen in three
minute speeches. Mr. Leonard
discussed the Seal Fishery Cons
terencc, showing the dirhcrilty and
desirability of preservrng the in
to future generations.
Owen discussed the chances for
an intercollegiate debate.

The propriety or using general
taxes to provide Collegecducation
in state universities was up for
discussion in the debate. it was
afﬁrmed by Way and Wyatt, the
latter volunteering in place of an
absent member. They urged the
present dependence oi lealning
and progress on aid from taxation
and the indebtedness of the state
itself to education and educators.
The opposition was irirnislred by
Mollcr andlaclrson ontlie grounds
of injustice in taxing all for educa-
tion of a few and the inevitable
neglect of moral and religious
training in state institutions. The
president was inclined toward the
afﬁrmative.
