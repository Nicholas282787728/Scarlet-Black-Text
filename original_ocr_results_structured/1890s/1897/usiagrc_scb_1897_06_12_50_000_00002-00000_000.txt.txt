IN a two-column article headed
“Government by Injunction
Again," The Oiitlpo/r in its latest
issue comments on a matter ol
the greatest interest and gravest
importance to all friends of edu-
cation in America and to us par
ticularly as connected with Iowa
College. The succession of events
following in the wake of the pre
sentation of Pres. Gates’ paper
betore the College Section of the
Southeastern Iowa Teachers Ase
sociation and its subsequent pubs
lication in pamphlet term by the
Kingdom Company under the
title “A Foe to American Schools”
has been noticed in our previous
issues. The latest development
in the case appeared Thursday
night when the United State Mar-
shall served papers on President
Gates enjoining him to appear in
court to answer to the charge of
libel preferred by the American
Book Company. The amount of
damages assessed is $100,000.
In the course of the article refer-
red to The Outlook says: “The con-
tcst precipitated by this suit in-
volves a large number or men
and women who are connected
directly or indirectly with the
educational work of the country.
” * President Gates is a man
widely known in educational and
religious circles. * *’ On the
other hand the American Book
Company numbers among its
ofﬁcers and managers men of the
highest business standing, who
have been connected with educa-
tionalwork tor many years and
no doubt welcome, as they alight,
the opportuuity to place their
side of the case before the public.
* * While the outcome of the
case will be serious in its chct

upon either the accusers or the N-

accused, we advise our readers to

put themselves in the attitude of
mind of intelligent and honorable
jurymcir and wait until they have
hc'ard all the evidence beiore they
frame their verdict." This attir
tutle taken by so prominent a pa-
per is refreshing in these days
when the most the majority of
papers dare to do in a contest ber
tween a private c en ancl a great
corporation. is to refrain from
openly supporting the interests
or the corporation. This contest
is fraught with more than cduca»
tional interest. It is one ot many
such that must he waged before
the question ol the moral respon-
sibility of the individual members
of a corporation for the acts of
the corporation as a whole shall
be settled lt touches on ques
tions of vital interest in the de-
velopment of our American clemr
ocracy. All honor too the man
who has the courage oi his con-
victions, who dares “to see what he
sees, not what others tell him he
sees." We need more srich men.
who can take as their motto,
"Fear not."

Athletic Union Meeting.

The Athletic Union was called
to order at his p. m. Thursday
by Pres. Templeman, The ofﬁr
cers of the Union for next year
were elected as follows: President,
Beyer; Viceprcsident, Fisher;
secretary anti Treasurer, Lyman;
Track Manager, I-Iart. Brown
handed in his resignation as assist
ant football manager. It was ac-
cepted and Spaulding was elected
to the vacancy. An amendment
to the constitution making the
secretary and treasurer a member
42: aﬂri'a or the Executive Corns
mittée was discussed and laid on
the table for action at the ﬁrst
meeting next tall.

After the Athletic Union meet-
ing Captain Armstrong called the
members of the ’96 football team
together and presented to them
his resignation. The tact that he
ﬁnds it impossible to be in college
next year is his reason tor resign
ing. Under the circumstances

his resignation was accepted. alr
though it was with feelings of
deepest regret on the part or all
members of the team. H. II.
Coggeshall, ‘00, was elected to
the position.
