THE CONCERT at Oskaloosn last
Wednesday evening was the last
of the entertainments to be given
by the Glee Club and Ampiiiorr
orchestra this year. Tire season
iras been a srreeesstrrl one and
good houses have greeted the ore
ganizationswherevCi they have ap-
peared. As an aid in bringing
iowa College into closer relations
ship with the people of the state,
tireir work has been invaluable,
and wherever they have gonetlley
have made impiessions rvhich will
accrue to the beneﬁt or the insti-

tutiou.‘ The prospects are better 5'

than ever for next year and we
anticipate a still greater success
both tor the orchestra and glee
Cllib through their increased abilr
ity and experience.

Tiiiz Join debate between the
literary societics oi the academy
will occur next Friday evening,
and it is to be hoped that a large
audience will be in attendance.
The academy societics deserve
especial praise tor the work which
they are doing this term at the
time when such work is often al—
lowed to lag. These societies
have many live, active members
who will do a great deal toward
helping to strengthen tlle college
societies next year, :is iras been
evinced by the quality oi their
work duiing the present one.

The Spiering Quartetle.

The Spiering String Quartette
oi Chicago gave the last and in
many respects tile most pleasing
of the concerts of the subscrips
tion Couisc.

Individually the members come
posing it are artists and taken
collectively their playing showed
some of the ﬁnest work in phray
ing which has ever been shown to
a Grinnell audience.

After the ﬁrst number they
were compelled to respond to a
hearty encore.

Tile second number, Brim/t, Kol
Nldrei by Mr. Dicstel, was one of
the best for showing the remark-
able ability of the performer.

The third number, Sr/ntbrrt.Var-
iations from D minorgrrartet, was
the best received of the evening,

Mr. Spiering showed himseii as
a master in his rendering of Prime
Song and Hungarian Dance.

The Quartct in ‘D Minor, C/mu
ziliim’. was a ﬁtting close to a pro-
gram so excellent throughout.
