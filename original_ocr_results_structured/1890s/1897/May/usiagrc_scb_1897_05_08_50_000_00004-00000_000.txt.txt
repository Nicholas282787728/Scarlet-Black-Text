the

Ames Dcfe d.

The baseball team won their-
ﬁrst victory ot the ycnl‘ this moms
ing. by deieating the husky lads
from Amcs in a game which was
n trottle ot pitchers, wcll splinklcd
with errors.

Neither side scored in the ﬁrst.
though Griiinell got three men on
the bases, In the second Coggcs
shall got around on a hit, a stolen
base, a sacxiﬁce and a passed ballr
Lindsay’s twmbagger and a com-
edy of errors counted up three [or
Griniicll in the third, and two hits
and some more errors gave us two
in tltelottrtli. Nellliei-sidescored
then until the sixth, when Ames
broke the series ot goose eggs
and scored four unearned runs,
while the Gi'innell boys \verc’in
the nether-t Alter that only two
scores were counted and they carno
our way in the ninth on Davis‘ lnt,
Bnrnip's error, n base on balls to
Shepard and a timely hit over the
inﬁeld by Mohi'.

Davis’ work was particularly
ﬁne at critical times, and he de-
serves all credit for winning the
genre, His ﬁelding was inagiliﬁs

cent. Anderson pitched ﬁiic ball
throughout but was poorly sup»
ported and the errors behind him
were costly, while, except in the
one inning, Grinnell's errors did
not affect the score.

 

The liinpii-ing was sati aetory
to all and there was no wrangling

to spoil the ploasnr-e of the garlic.-
