The Institute program was open-
ed by Brown with a reading troin
Bryant. Peterson reviewed tlte
principal events of the week.
Whitehtll read an instructive pa-
per on M ‘co and the
she is making as a nation. espec-
ially mentioning the improve-
ments in the public school system,
methods of agriculture, and the
large increase orruilroad blisitie
Laybourn spoke oi the possibil-
ities of irrigation, and the intense
struggle of tlte west to redeem its
obligations as some of the prob-
lems of arid America.

Tire extemporztneous work con-
sisted of three numbers: Base-
ball in Iowa [or ’97, by Noel;
McKinley's cabinet to Date, by
Rich'cr; A Chapel Talk by Mtll-
laii.

Miss Case favored the society
with ttvo most acceptable vocal
selections. The question for der
bate, "Resolved, that the pardonr
ing power ofthe state government
should be restricted," was sup-
ported in the afﬁrmative by Spalde
ing and Authier. and the negative
by Sargent and Temple. The de-
cision tvas in favor of the negative

progress

Chrestomathian.

A good literary program was
carried out, but the debate on the
question of the justness of the ine
junctions issued against the Chicar
go strikers by the federal judges
was not good. Two or the lead
ing speakers were absent and the
others failed to enthttse the rest
oi the members with a great in-
terest in the importance or either
side. This may have been partly

 

due to the absence oi several or
the older members lrom the meet-
ing.

Quaiie showed material tor a

aneous work, He spoke three
minutes on the subject or e
nations, and gave his opinion as

things about the orchestra that

ami-

outsiders do rret generally know,
and told it in an interesting way.

Marsh gave a few rterrrs and
personal thoughts with regard to
woman‘s ability and right to vote.

Grier began the exercises by
reading an excellent paper. “A
Glance at the Nineteenth Cetra

tury,” which, rt it had been com.
mitted, would have well ﬁlled its
position as an olation for which
the program called.

I’icrpont made an in :ovation on

the rcgt . routine programs by
delivering a well prepared lecture
with the subject. "Bescliwerliclr
keiteri.” He gave as nuisances
principally those things that are
trying to a person's nerves. For
the bald-headed man are the pes-
tering fiy and. not least, the in
quisitivc small boy, Lectures are
nuisances sometimes, and the
iunny mart.
‘ Witnter gave a select reading.
“\Iotlse Huntlrlg,” but his voice
rather inarrcd his delivery oi such
a spirited piece.

Miss Case krrrdly sang tit-o oi
her best selections arid pleased
everyone as always, The society
has also to thank Miss Parsons
again tor a piano solo and encore.
