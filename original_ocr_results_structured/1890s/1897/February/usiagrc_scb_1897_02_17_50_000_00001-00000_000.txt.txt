be disappointed. Coming to the
substance of the lecture, he said:
Society is a constant development.
The old order changes, giving
place to the new. It is the duty
of each one to do what he can to
direct this change. Civ ation

the most carctul husbandry. The

tour has been superseded by the
factory system. The foundation
or this system is invcntion. with
‘which is coupled division of labor.
‘The lesult ot this is seen in the
vastiy‘increascd production, one
man now does the wot-it or ﬁity
under the old regime. Four mil-
lions ot tactory wotkcls produce
goods to the value of six or seven
billion dollars every year. While
all are eniiclied to some extent
through this great increase in pror
duction. it is an undeniable fact
that the common laborer does not
share in it in a fair proportion to
his services.

As was noted above, the plincir
ple of society enters largely into
the tactory system. society, how
ever. is suitable only to social nae
tures. and it is this difference of
natures that is rcsponsible tor the
varying results or good or evil.
The personal inﬂuence of the
manager has much to do in decid~
ing whether the influence shall be
tor good or cvrl.

Then followed a careiul states
m'ent of the two classes which
have in connection with
this system, and the distinctions.
soclal and otherwise, nhlch are
constantly growing. Examples
were cited ol men who had over-
come this tendency and were con-
ducting their business in accord
ance with the social bond of 3f,
lectionate sympathy. The emr
ploycr must consider hrs
ployces as the ﬂock over which
he is the shepherd. The two
classes are not to plunder each
other. but on the contrary are to
help each other.

The employment ot women in
factories and child labor in lac»
tories were taken up as problems
ot such importance in connection
with the factory system as to de»
mand immediate solution.

Man is the bread winner and
woman the home builder. Any-
thing subverting this end is to be
discountenanced. Yet the ten
dency of modern industry when
lett purely to economic tor-cos, is
to supplant men by women, Mae
terial development and moral chr

veloplttent must. however, be com-
bined. The ethical force as \VCll
