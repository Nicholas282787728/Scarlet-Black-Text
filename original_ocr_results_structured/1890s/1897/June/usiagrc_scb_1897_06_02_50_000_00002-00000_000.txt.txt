THE CLASS of ninety-eight are
to be congratulated on their suc-
ccss in a new ﬁeld tor college an-
nual boards. We hope that they
may reap in tnll measure the liar—
vest of praise andyproﬁt which
they have so fully earned.
next issue we will give an extend-
ed review by one of the best crit-
ics in Grinnell.

In our

FOR THE third successive time
the tracl: team has swept away
all competition in the state games
and the long fought—for cup is
Grinnell's forever. For the man
who is responsible in a large dcr
gree forr the splendid showing
which brought about the rcaliza»
tion ot our tondest hopes tor the
team, Grinnell students have
nothing but thehlghestprzlise and
regard. Mr. Watson's work has
shown him beyond comparison
the best trainer in the west and
the peer oi any in the country.
The Grinnell team has gone into
two hard fought games under his
supervrsion and not a man has
shown signs ot undertraining or-
overtraining, nor has any one
reached the limit of strength.
This record is certainly remark-
able. Add to this the improve
ment shown in events where Grin-
nell has always been weak and we
doubt whether any other trainer
can show such results in his work.
Grinnell bids Mr. Watson good-
bye with sincere regret. wishing
him all success in his competitions
and hoping that another season

will see him in charge of the col- r

lege team.

Notes on S. U. l. Game.
O’Connor was unable to run so
the ﬂeet looted captain of the
University team cztntered bases
for him.

The thorough discipline and
conﬁdence acquired on the Des

- cor-ah trip was an irrestirnablc tac-

tor m the victory.

The crowd grew enthusiastic in
the ninth, when the ﬁrst two up
scored an earned run, but their
joy was short-lived.

The team work and “heady”
playing otthe Grinnellteam. es-
pecially in batting and baseruw
ning was remarked on all sides.

The S. U. 1. base runners evi—
dently remembered their experir
ence trying to steal on Mohr in
the other game. But one attempt
was made Saturday and that only
with a man on third.

5. U. I. drove over to Mt. Ver-
non last Friday and defeated Cor-
nell 114. They were supremely
conﬁdent of Saturday's game and
the boys' playing was a complete
surprise. “What have you been
doing with those follows for six
weeks?" was the query every-
where after the game.

Commencement Concert!

The Commencement Concert
has always been regarded as the
musical event ot the latter part of
the college year, and the one near
at hand will be no exception. Mr.
Joseph sclrreurs, the principal
soloist. is a Belgian by birth and
showed marvellous ability in early
youth, having won the ﬁtst prize
at the Conservatory of Brussels
at the age at 12. He has played
in all the cities of Holland and
Belgium and concertized two sear
sons in France. He was brought

to this country by Thomas in ‘85.
since which time he has retained
hrs place in the Thomas orchestra
as ﬁrst clarincttist and soloist.

Miss Raw, Mr. Emery and the
full Amphion orcltcstrawill assist.

Notice.

Please report allsales of tickets
to Saturday’s game in the Read-
ing Room from two to four to
morrow afternoon. ‘
