The Western lntercolleglate.

\ Rush Unable to Run.

Saturday's meeting of the W, I.
C. A. A. in Chicago, although
somewhat of a disappointment to
Grinncll people was by long odds
the best meeting of the Associa-
tion that has yet been held. It
was productrvc or tour new west»
ern records and one new worlds
record. In addition to this two
western records were equalled.

First place had been conceded
to Wisconsin, tor shc possesses
the strongest track team ever sent
out by a western institution. In
addition to the starsiMaybury,
Richards and Kraeuzleinishe has
strong second and third place men
in numerous events. Wisconsin
had points to spare. winning a total
of 47, while the nearest compete
itor, Michigan. was obliged to be
contented with to.

It was not an ideal day fora
track meet, the weather being cold
and disagreeable. The effect was
perhaps most noticed in the ﬁeld
events, but the strong wind which
blew clown the stretch materially
aided the sprinters. The low rec-
ords made in some of the events
are doubtless traceable to this.

Maybury of Wisconsin won the
too-yard dash handily in 9 475 sec»
onds. His greatest competitor,

 

otir own Rush, was still sicl: and
in no condition to run, although
he made his appearance in one
heat of the preliminaries, running
second to Maybury. His coiidis
tion was so inanitcstly unequal to
the task, however, that Trainer
Watson positively refused to al-
low him to go on the track again.
This somewhat spoiled the meet
for us, and detiactcd from the ins
terest of our rootcrs in the rest of
the events.

Richards of Wisconsin won the
IZDsyai'tl hurdles in 15 4-5 seconds.
The record is due to the compcti
tion afforded by Mclvcan of Miclr
igan who ran a dangerously close
second. Armstrong won third
place.

Spaulding was uniortunate in
being obliged to run his trial heat
against Richards. and Calhoun of
Chicago.

In the 220-yarcl dash, Maybury
sct mail; for the world's
record,doingthe distanceinzl 275.
The course is to be surveyed to
ascertaiir whether it was correctly
measured.

Fellows won third place in both
the mile and half-milcruns. Both
races went in good time.

The score of the points won by
the several institutions is as fol-
lows: Wisconsin, 47; Michigan.
19; Minnesota, 14; Chicago, is;

A FAST GAME.

5. U. L, 5; Grinnell, 3.

The baseball team from the
State University came tip last Sate
urday with its personnel slightly
changed, and won by a score oi
ﬁve to three on: of the best games
ever played in Grinnell. only
one hour and ﬁttcen minutes of
playing was necessary to decide
the game which was replete with
features which appeal to the spec-
tators.

Davis was ﬁrst to bat and sent
out a long ily to center which
Reynolds misjudged, letting Dar
vis reach second. Ralcy followed
with twosbagger and Davis
scored. Lindsay and Sargent went
out from Brown to Schooley and
Mohr fanned.

a

 

tum hit for three base Thomas
reached ﬁrst on Davis' cl or.
Mack was out on a hit to Lindsay
and Schooley ﬂew to Coggesliull.

Both went out in order in the
second, a ieaturc being a brilliant
double play by Sargent, Lindsay
and Raley.

Grinnell was out one, two, three
in the third, but after two men
were out and a man on second,
Mores by slow ﬁelding of two
singles allowed three runs to
Count.

The fourth saw the men go out
in order; in the ﬁfth a single by
Moi-cs and twosbagger by Davis
scored one. Mayttrnt got a two
hagger but died at second. '

In the sixth Mohr was leit on
second where his twosbagger
perched him. Lowry reached
ﬁrst on an error, went to third
on a hit and scored on a wild
pitch.

Tliesevcnth was played In short
order, as was the eighth, the mos
notony being relieved by a douhle
play, Mack to Seltoolcy.

Hits by Sargent 'and Shepard
