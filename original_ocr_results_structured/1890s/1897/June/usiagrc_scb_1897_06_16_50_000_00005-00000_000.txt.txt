Gleason, of Minneapolis.

The theme at the address was
the ucce. ity for all Christian to

scud I you." If the occasion (lee
ruarrds, the Christian must be pre
pared to follow Christ “even to
prison and to death," trusting in
the pionii e of the Father that
“All things wor together for
good to them that love Him."
