Improvements at Athletic Park.

Manager Noel has been making
arrangements the past week to
have the base ball diamond put
into condition for the season. He
expects to have enough dirt
haulcdin to ﬁllittrpaiter about the
same plan as the assocration ten-
nis courts No improvements
have been made on the diamond
in the last few years. consequently
it has become worn away so that
every rainstorm transforms it into
a miniature lalr'c. With those
who saw it on such occasions last
spring there will be no question
as to the advisability of the out»
lay.

Trouble at Monmouth.

Nine students of the sophomore
class or Monmouth Collcgc were
