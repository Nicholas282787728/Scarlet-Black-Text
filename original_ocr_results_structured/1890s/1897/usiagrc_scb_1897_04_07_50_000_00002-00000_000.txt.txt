The Track Team.

It is still quite early in the sea-
son for us to make any correct es~
timate of our chances of success
or failure in track worliz. All he
can say is that there IS a very cont
mendable activity in some lines
and a great lack of it ill other
lines. Reports from all over the
state go to show that it we win
this spring it will require the g. elite
est effort ever put forth bya Glln'
nell team. 5. U. I. is very stlong,
Ames and Corllell both are cone
ﬁdent of making us work for our
victory if we gain it; Dralee is
stro'ngel than ever before, and the
athletes at the State Normal

. School and Upper lowa Univer-
sity are all training taithrully.

Cap‘tain Rush is putting forth
every effort to train up a winning
team, but his efforts will come to
naught without the eoUperation of
all. The men have been training
outdoors thelastweek; the sprint»
ers and distance men on,the cili-
der path in tlle campus and the
candidates for the other events
back of the tennis courts.

The distance men are showing
up fairly well under tlle direction
of Fellows, ’00. Of the men who
trained for the longrnns last year,
Fellows. Douglass, Finer and

‘Shadbolt are out this spring; be-
sides these, Lyman, Norris, Lar-
son, Robinson and Patterson are
interesting men.

There is a deplorable laclc of
interest in the lrammentlirow.
More men must begin work on
this event or we will make but a
poor showltlg next Spring. The
material is in school and we must
develop it.

The walkers, undel the dliectioti
of Marsh, 98, who are uoi ltlng
now are Flisbie, Robelts. O. Ris-

,ser and Peterson. These men are
all training faithfully and we hope
to hear from them in the spring.

The candidates for the high
jump are numerous than
usual. Some of the men are clear
ing the bar at about ﬁve feet and
with diligent practice should in-
crease this distance constdct'ably.
Among those training are Craver,
A. Rissel', Campbell, Blackburn,
Waterman. Engelkc and Snyder.
These are worthy new men, whose
powers are yet to he developed,

Most ot the “bilte” men are also
inexperienced. They should
train conscientionsiy and remelllr

more

her that it they don't. succeed in,
developing remarkable speed this‘

spring they may next. Spauldin

tlemali and \Vcllccr have all been
out repeatedly and appear to be
doing good Wolli.

Captain Rush has tlle splinters
allrlnlitltlle distance men under
his iinmetlillti: care. Rush, Allie
son, Sprltllt‘ling, Shepard andSltitr
are the oltl nlen training; torthese
cvents. while l’al'lsll. Snytlel and
Rlssei'al'c (lolng very creditable
work.

\Vllitellill had the misfoltune to
sprain his wrist while vaulting ill
the gymnasium a couple of weeks
ago and will be laid up for some
time yet, but will doubtless re-
cover in time to give a good ac
count at hin ~elt crc spring, Mo
clnren, Engellre, leech, Fellows
and Sllcpaltl have also been train~
mg fol this event. These are all
new men and are for the most
part showing up well,

or the hurdlcr- Armstrong,
Spauldillg and Fi ler are perhaps
leading the others at present but
this is crying to the training they
have done in former year's, Snyr
der and Boyle are showing up
rather strong and “ill run their
more experienced competitors a
merry race by the time the home
ﬁeld day comes off.

Tenlplelnan, ’97, has been work-
ing faithfully with the shot put-
ters and quite a number have zlpr
per-lied repeatedly for plactice,
Some of them are Gray, Rush,
Shepard, Spnllltlillg, Skiff, Hart,
Arnoltl, Cl'abb and Core. We
hope they will prnctiee taithtully
and remember that second and
third places win held meets often»
times, ,

The weather has been some
what nnpropitious for the broad
iumpers, but nevertheless Mettle
man, Brown, Coiley, Spaulding.
and others have appeared regular-
ly for practice.

The new men will have to win
our ﬁeld meet for us this year,
and they must remember that
athletes “do rlot spring up like
inusllroons in a mg ht but are de
velopcd by a course oi hand and
systematic training. This means
regular hours and a systematic
diet. They should also remem-
ber that second and third places
will ﬁeld meets. Ollr new men
al'cshowing up well on the aver-
age but they must never give up
their training until the last race is
run.
