THE AEOLIAN MANDOLIN CLUB

soiering Concert.

The musical event of the year
occurred last evening when the
Spiering String Quartet gave a
program to a small but apprecia-
tive audience. To all who heard
the quartet last year it was but a
repetition ot the pleasures enjoy»
ed at that time. Those hearing
them tor the ﬁrst time hope to
hear them again, It is useless to
try to express the teeling ot the
audience in words.

The ﬁrst number from Dvorah
was one otthe best ot the evening.
The peculiar harmony and strong
rythm attractcd in a way that no
other music can. There is a faci-
nation in such music that only
those knowing mnsic well can ex»
plain. Mr. Herman Diestcl’s
'cello solo was heartily encored to
which he very pleasantly respond-
ed. The next number from Tsch»
ailtowsky was the best of the
evening. The sweet mellow har-
mony carried all away from them-
selves and the performers to hear
only the tones as they came so
smoothly and softly. in direct
contrast in style was the Scherzo

 

from Cherubini. The violin solo
by Mr. spiering only made the
audience demand another, which
equalled his ﬁrst. When the quar-
tet appeared for the last number
there was an added applause tor
our own Mr. William Dicstel. It
is impossible to describe the beans
ty of tone which always comes
lrorn appreciative playing ot Mos
zart. This closed the evening and
left the audience with a leeling
that the time had gone all too
quickly. Grinnell should feel
proud otthe musical opportunities
she has and should do her utmost
to obtain more such.
