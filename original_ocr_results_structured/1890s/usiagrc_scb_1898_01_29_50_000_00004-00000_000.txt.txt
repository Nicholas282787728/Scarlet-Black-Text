Owing to the number ol copies
t'emdiniiig yet on hand of 0/11;

visahle to reduce the price on the
book for a short trnie. The, sule
has treen good and many iavora.
ble reviews of the volume have
been received from the press at
large. There is good reason to
believe that lhlS reduction in price
will result in a large sale in the
next lortniglit. Many students
have put all getting the Annual,
expecting to secure a copy some
time. Now is just the Kipporitttil~

The price has been placed tempo»

if sent by mail. it is very likely
that this cut rate ﬁgtiic will only

,is too late. The books will be put
