The Debate.

As the day of the third annual
debate di-atts near, there is a grati-
fying growth ol interest in the
event. It is becoming generally
recognized, throughout lhc'stus
body, that intercollegiate
debate is Jusl as important a ﬁeld
of student enterprise. as is athlet-
Anrl it is with great gratifh-
cation that ““6 note the keen in»
terest in the outcome of this de-
bate, ulllcll has made itself evi-
dentin lhe last few days.

The debate will, in all likeli-
hootl, not be unworthy of this in~

It will, without doubt, he

thc thoroughly prepared
and the hardest fought contest of
any held thus tar, The Grlnnell
spl'itltitrs, though handicapped by
the late sclcction, will, neverthee
be thoroughly prepared.
They have been and are putting
forth almost Superhuman effort
and Friday night will ﬁnd them
plcpm'crl tor any turn tvhich our
opponents may take. On the
othcl hand ihc Cornell speakers
are not handicapped by late Sclecr
tion or lack of support. They
were chosen early and have
worked hard. Two otthcmspcnt
a week in Chicago studying the
question. Every society man in
the college is studying the ques»
tion, and the speakers get the
beneﬁt of it all. Were there such
a spirit as that here, Grinnell
would be the leader not only of
Iowa athletics, but ol Iowa intern
collegiate debating.

However, Gl'lhllcll has won
many contests under great disad-
vantages, and this debntc rs not
lost yet. The great interest

less,

 

aroused cannot fail to put new life
into the work of our Speakers and
they may have “Something up
their sleeves" when the debate
comes off.

The subject of the debate is:

Granted. that a uniform mon-
etary standard for the entire world
is desirable;

Resolved, that it is best attained
by gold nioliometalism.

Cornell'sthree debaters, Messrs.
Jayne. Heald and Belts will up
hold the afﬁrmative, while Grins
nell's representatives, W. H. Dene
nison, R. D. Douglass and F. M.
Roberts. will support the negative.

The men who will act asjudges
are Dr. Henry R. Hatﬁeld of
Chicago University, and Profes-
sors Loos and Shombaugh. both
of S. U. I.

The music for the evening will
be worth the price of admission.
Everyone likes to hear Miss Prea
vost sing and she has consented'
to sing “Die Beden Grenadiere.”
by Schumann. as the opening
number tor the evening The
Glee Club has agreed to ﬁll up
the gap between the last speech
anti thejudges decision. The pro-
gram as a whole will be well worth
hearing. even though one is not
interested in the debate. The
young ladies of the college have
taken in hand the decorations and
enthusiasm and everyone may
rest assured that tltere will not be
any dry or dull moments. The
mass meeting Monday afternoon
stirred rip great enthusiasm and
the students will attend almost in
a body. Everything now promises
the most successful and interest
ing debate yet held.

word was rcccivcd yesterday
from Cornell that a special train
would be run from that institution
Friday and that there would he
one hundred and ten students ac-
company the debaters.

Calocaclnstirute Joint Meeting.

Saturday cvening.instead of the
regular Institute program, occur-
red a joint meeting ot the in '
tute and Calocagalhian socictrcs.
the ﬁrst one held this year. In
spite of the bad weather, there
was a fair leprescntation of both
Societies present. Mr. Davis,
president of the Institute, called
the mectingto order. The Missesl

 

Oral and Ethel Graham furnished
the muSiC or the evening, consist
ing of two very pleasing mando
Iin and guitar duets and an encore.

The main feature of the pros
gram was a farce, “Cox and box.“
Mr. Delavan took the part of Mr,
Box. Mr. Snider of Mr, Cox, and
Miss Calla Hand very ably rcprCA
resented the typical boarding
house lady oi the thrifty order.
The play is very amusing and
brings in some highly ludicrous
situations, which were very well
carried out by those taking part.
Both Mr. Snider and Mr. Delavan
did very good acting,espccial|y
in consideration of the fact that
the men's society does so little
dramatic work. Mr. Delavan put
an amount of energy into the act-
ing that made it much above the
average.

After the literary program. the
societies adjourned.and the meets
ing was turned into a social gall»
ering which lasted for an hour or
more. nght reireshmenls were
served and a general good time
cnjoycd by all present.

Mr. Owen gave a very comple-
hensive and interesting lecture on
passenger and freight elevators.
He spoke of the three kinds which
are most commonly used.—thc
steam, the hydraulic and those
run by electricity,7calling espe-
cial attention to the advantages of
the pressure tank system.

This was iollottcd by a wells
written paper by Hays. In which
be traced [he developement ot
music up till goo A. 0,. the begin-
ning of modern harmony. Its ore
igln is unknown and is probably
an outgrowth ofnature itself. The
Chinese discovered the twelve
tones but had no knowledge of vie
brations. The Hindoos believe
that it was‘created by some god.
It is probable that the Egyptians
were the ﬁrst to work out the
mathematical relations. The ora-
tion by Blodgett, entitled “The
New Era,"was delivered in a quiet
though pleasing way, and showed
agreat deal of thoughtful study.

The debate was on the question,
“Resolved: That a congressman
should vote as his constituents
would have hint, rather than ac»

ionntinucd on Second Fagc.)
