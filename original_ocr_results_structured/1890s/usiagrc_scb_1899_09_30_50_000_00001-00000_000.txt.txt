Grinnell Institute.

The meeting of Grinnell Insti-
tute Wednesday evening was in-
deed gratitying to the older meni-
bers, for instead of there being
two rows of empty chairs in the
front of the room, every seat in
the room was occupied, and, in
addition, some borrowed ones.
The program was opened with a
banjo and guitar duet by Thomp-
son and Eldredge which had to
be' responded to with an encore.
Smith then gave a conerse outline
of the leadlng events of the past
week. Parish followed with a ﬁve
minute talk on the Argentine Re-
public. Ile spoke of the great
natural resources of this country,
the mrldness of its climate and
how queer it is that so few ‘Amer-
icans emigrate there as it is quite
thinly populated—less than trait
as thickly as the United States.
Otis then gave a very interesting
reading trom Doyle’s “Memoirs
of Sherlock Holmes.” Waterman
then favored the society with two
very well rendered vocal solos,
which were responded to with an
encore.

Crandall followed with “Sums
mer ltems,”summarizing the prin-
cipal events that took place dur-
ing the summer months. He
spoke especially ot the progress
of the war in the Philippines and
the Peace Conference at the
Hague.

The extemporancous work of
the evening consisted of a talk on
the South African troubles by
Swan. in which he gave the chief
causes of the troubles and recent
incidents connected with them.
Chase followedwithatalk on Foot~

 

boll Pr ospects. comparing ourteam
with some of the opposing teams
and urging greater interest of the
student body in football matters.
Rnhison concluded the extempo»
raucous work with a talk on the
“Dreyfus affair " He showed
great familiarity with his subject
and readiness ol spccch. irom
which many old members might
take note, The last two numbers
indicate that there are at least two
new members capable ot doing
good socrety uork The literary
program \tascorlcltlded by Thompr
son and Eldredge rendering “Blur
menlred” on banjo and guitar.

At the business meeting ten
were received into associate mem-
bership of the society to become

Oratorical.

It may be well to call the atten-
tion of His students to the fact
that the State Oratorical Contest
is to be hclcl in Grinnell this year.
Our home contest, from which
Grittnell‘s representative is to be
chosen. will take place about the
middle of Deccniber. just before
the holiday vacation. All who
are thinking of entering the can
test should begin work at once,
and continue to work earnestly
until the selection of a represen»
tative has been made. The event
is worthy the best efforts that any
one can prrt forth, Thorrgh the
complaint is made that the State
Contest has a large element of
chance conncclctl with it. yet the
beneﬁts to the individual alrd the
school are such as to call for our
most earnest efforts.

In the sruallcr colleges of the
state the contest is made the event
of the year, But here where our
energies are divided along so
many different lines, it has prob-
ably not received even the attenr
tion it deserves,

We have faith that Grinnell can
with honor compete with the oth-
er schools of the state. if she only
will do so; and rhis ycar, cspcc-
ially, it behooves us to take more
interest in such work, and to make
the state contest a success. To
do this we must be represented by
our best material. For this reason
all who can should enter the
home contest. There ought to be

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, I899,

enough candidates to make a pre»
liminary contest necessary in each
of the four college societies. We
do not wiin to be unrepresented
in this year's state contest, as was
the case the last time it was held
here. Let us infuse some of our
“Grinnell spirit” into this line of
work, and let us accomplish some
thing for the honor of ourcollege.

The ofﬁcers of the Oratorical
Association will be glad to give
any information wanted; and the
English professors will always be
found willing to help anyone
desiring it

Freshman Party.

The Freshman class held its
ﬁrst party of the year in the form
of a reception at the society halls
last Friday evening. Nearly all
of the members of the class, which
has an enrollment of about one
hundred, were present. Besides
the members of the class the fac-
ulty were represented by Miss
Rand, Miss Millard, Prof. Nollcn
and Prof. Emery. All those inc
vited were requested, in the invir
tation. to represent some book.
Each guest, on arrival. was pro.
vided with a card and pencil, with
which to write down the name of
the books guessed. As an aid to
the game each one was given a
number, the guessing being done
by the number which each wore.

Many of the books were repre-
sented in a most novel and unique
manner, and were a credit to those
who represented them. “The
Rose in Bloom,” “Innocents
Abroad,” and “Pickwick Papers”
seemed to be the favorites, sever-
al of each being represented.

After most of the books had
been guessed, light refreshments
were served. Mr. Hamlin and Mr.
Staat then took a flashlight of the
class, and while the camera was
being procured Miss Parsons en-
tertained the class by a very in»
teresting recitation which was well
received.

There will a Ladies' Glee Club
organized at s. U. I. this year.

A course in Colloquial and Com-
mercial Spanish is offered at Cor-
nell this year. One of the reasons
given for this move is that of the
commerciaiimportance otspanish
for the people of this country.
