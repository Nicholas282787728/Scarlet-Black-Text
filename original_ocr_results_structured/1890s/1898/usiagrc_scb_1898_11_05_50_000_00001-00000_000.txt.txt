Ames-IS. U. 1. Controversy.

The controversy between Amcs
and S. U. 1.. resulting in the
cancelling oi the game to be
played betwc‘en them today. is
an unfortunate affair. since it
leaves the state championship in
some doubt. Grinttell felt ltct'sclf
forced to discontinue athletic rer
lations with Ames for a year, and
now tltat the latter is not to meet
8. U. 1., the only comparison to
be madc oi the two teams in the
state is their showing ‘against
Drake. We are unable to judge
the merits of the controversy, as
the statements of the two iuSlItLlr
tions are sonieivliat contradictory,
Antes wanted the game to be
played there, since the last three

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA. SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 5,

games between the colleges had
been played at Iowa City, but
claim to have ﬁnally agreed to
play at iowa City ior 5225. This
agreement they say was broken by
S. U. I.

On the other hand the State
Utlivcrsity claims that thcy had
not agreed to give them the stated
amount, and that Iowa State Col-
lege refused to play at Iowa City.
S. U. i. then made arrangements
to play Minnesota and received
word front Amcs that they would
play at Iowa City The Mitrner
sota game was cancelled and ole
ﬁcials secured for the Antes—S U.
I game. and that Antes cancelled
this by telegram Thursday night.
and then nﬂered to play at Antes;
but S U. I. thought it too late (or

such an a angement.

Grinnell vs. Penn.
Tire game with Penn college
ito-day was by no means all that
might be expected. It reminded
us of the game with Simpson last
year when the ﬁrst hali ended in
a score oi 4-0 in Simpson‘s iavor.
We had great conﬁdence in the
deierrsive work oi our team which
has been better this week than
ever before. but in the ﬁrst half
Penn was able to puncture our

‘ lincforgain whenever they tried.

The half ended 00
The boys were altogether too

conﬁdent, and the ﬁrst half clear-
ly showed they were not so strong
as they thought. or else that Penn
was much stronger. If this state
oi conﬁdence in their own pl'ow»
ess continues, we will have good
cause to fear S. U. I, not to men-
tion an almost certain delcat by
Dritlcc.

In the second hall Grinnell
showed a little better spirit and
succeeded in scoring ttvo much-
downs and goals making the ﬁnal
score rz-o It was a hard game
and needed good work to tvitl.
The ball was in Gritiiiell’s lcrrtr
tor-y most of the ﬁrst halt and in
Penn's most of the last halt.

It was on Penn‘s 20 yard line
when time was called. Bttrd,
Westbrook and ereeler played
star games in the last half, but no
one did so in the ﬁrst. l’enn was
unable to puncture our line in the
last half as they did be‘fot‘e. Lind-
say and Capron wcrc ohlrgcd to
quit the game.

the School oi Music and was very
popular all college circles.
During the time she was connect»
ed with the college she sang iii
the choir oi the Congregational
clrrrrch and will long be remem-
bered for her beautiful soprano
voice. . Aitcr leaving Grinnell
Miss Aikman pursued her study
of must: elsewhere and during the
past year has taught music in ad
dition to singing in one of the
church choirs in Des Moines.

to have been the soprano in the
quartettc of the Plymouth Congre-
gational church. on last Sunday

that church and a ﬁtting tiibute

singer. ,
