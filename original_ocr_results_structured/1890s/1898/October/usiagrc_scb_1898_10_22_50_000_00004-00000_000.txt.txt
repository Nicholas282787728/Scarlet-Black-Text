rnent [tom others than playcrs is
when a gl'cat help too mum, and
this will he lacking to onr learn
tlnles some thnnell students rlL'
tend the gains. As the prospect
now is, it is yes hle that the Els-
sistance given the side lines may
be needed to win the gamc. In
former years Uppei Iowa has not
been very strong in football. It
has made a very ctedltable show~
Eng so far this year, antl will plobr
ahly glVC tisa good game, As yet
this year the Stat: University has
failed to show ally great strength,
but many times her team has
started the season with defeat
and ended it ivitli a rush that was
remarkable. At this time last
year her team had little prospect
ofgalningth: state championship.
but improved so rapidly as to tie
for it. Since being: heatcir by
Dralte, their only Chalice loi the
championship is to heat ns, anti
they are putting forth every effort
to that end. Drake is one of the
Strongest lestl- s in Iowa, and l>
holding gnarl chances of gaining
the state championship. which it
has never yet won. The general
opinion is that the championship
lies between Drake and Giinnell,
sotliatthis game will he one of
the most interesting ones or the
season. ‘

Drake 34, Monmouth o.

In yesterday's game at Des
Moines Monmouth was unable to
score on Drake while the latter
were able to make six touch
downs and four goals in two [wens
ty ﬁve minute llalvus. Although
Monmouth played a plucky tip
hill game thcir opponents team
played With a snap and Vigor that
could not be overcome. The
Drake team has improved greatly
dtlringthe past two weeks antl
their management is anxious to
secure a game with either North-
western or Chicago the ﬁrst of
next month, Their team goes to
Lincoln Nov. [Zlh to play the
University or Nebraska.
