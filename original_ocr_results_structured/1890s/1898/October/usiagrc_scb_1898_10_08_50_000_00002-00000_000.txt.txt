FOR THE beneﬁt of the students
who ride bicycles we print below
the ordinance which was recently
passed by the City Council. Com»
plaint has 'often been made that
the students are the ones who
most trequently disregard the
bicycle regulations ’and the sub
dents in turn i-epeatedlyassert that
they are not aware of any rules,
hence itoiten comes about that
they are called upon to interview
the mayor. While we regret ex-
ceedingly the fact that it has been
totrnd necessary to enact such a
strict ordinance yet so long as
there were any who were careless
in the carrying out ot the tormer
regulations we cannot help thinks
ing that the city council was to
some extentjustiﬁed in their ac-
tion. During the last two weeks
two or three persons have been in»
jured through the gross careless-
ness ot bicyclists.

WHILE GRiNNELL has achieved
well earned fame on gridiron,
track and diamond. it had never
fallen to her lot to be declared
victor in the W. I. A. A. A. meet
until during the last few days.
This came to pass, owing to a rath»
er peculiar combination ot Clrr
crimstances. in 1896, Gl'innell
sent probably the strongest team
which has ever represented her
to the Chicago meet. This team
rvon second place and was only
kept out oi ﬁrst by the fact that
“Speedy” Rush was deieatcd in
two races by the redoutable
Maybury. Mayhury‘s recent dis-
qualiﬁcation has given to Grins
nell the ﬁrst place points in the
races which he won, and with this
additional credit we can hold the
undisputed title or the champions
ot'the West in track athletes for
1896.

their way homeward rejoicing in

Miss Rand and Miss Raymond

ly aid and interest ill making this

event one to be long remembered
by all.
