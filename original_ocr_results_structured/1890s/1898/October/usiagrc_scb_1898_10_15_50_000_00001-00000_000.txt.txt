program a little Friday alter-noon
' by presenting a iarcr. Per Tele-

interesting throughout is in three‘

acts. The story runs as iollows:

pleased by the new 'tclcphonc

most of the day in calling up her
iriends and grocers per telephone.
In the aiternoon Guy Harling.

comes to call. and incidentally to
propose to Nan. This he is pier
vented irom doing by the telei
phone bell ringing every time the
critical point is reached. He
leaves in despair. intending: to
carry out his purpose that evetk
ing by telephone.
Mary Halcorns comes to see her
and answers the telephone in
Nan's absence. Mr. Malling,
thinking it to be Nan Cltzzln in
stead oi Nan's cousin, proposes
and is accepted by Mary. The
mistake is immediately discover-
ed. of course. Just at this critical

The day opened cool and clear
on the big football game played
at Minneapolis between the U. at
M, and Iowa College of Grinnell.
Had there not been too much
wind the day would have been an
idealonc tor the game and this
was shown by the size of the very
enthusiastic audiencei

In starting the ﬁrst half Capt.
Cole of Minnesota won the toss
and chose the east side, while
Grinncllkiclred off. Minnesota
caught the ball and tried to print
buthrcelet- stopped it. Minne»
sota, however, retained possession
oi the ball and vainly tries to
overrun their little opponents. but
the Grintlell players show their
spirit at the outei and force the
university to punt ivithotit having
trained their ﬁrst ﬁve yards. Lind-
say caught and returned the ball
in yards. Fisher then took it for
a beautiful run round the right
end for 25 yards. Rule followed
with to yards round the other
end. Mrnncsota ends are still
weak and Fisher gets 15 yards
more. Peirce then went through
the has of his big opponents in
his usual style. gaining '5 yards
and the ﬁrst touchdown after only
nine minutes play, Score, Grin

Minnesota-kicked on 35 yards
to Taft, who returned to. Grin-
ncll shows-the lack of practice. and
fumbles. allowing Minnesota to
get the ball, who inalv‘c; a royard
run and" begins hcr line plays.
\thn Minnesota is almost conﬁ-
dent of a touch-down, she is held
by Grlnne'll on thc lattcr's Sryarrl
line and loses possession oi the
hall. Pierce punts 30 yards, Min.
nesota fails to gain any ground on
the return. ﬁrinnell again shows
that she knows how to stop the
iamous Pennsylvania system. and
holds Minnesota ior dorvn‘s.

Rule then takes the ball for 30
yards round the end, but is called
lor Grnincll's holding.
Minnesota takes the ball, is again
