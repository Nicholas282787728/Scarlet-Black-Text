Public Speaking at Amherst

a sorry enough object, but if there

the will to do would always insure
the correct doing. ours would inc

the experience otthc youth who
faces his ﬁrst public audience will
speedily convince him that there
has entered into his little universe
an untoreseen. disturbing element,
the exact force of which no
amount or previous clear thinking
would have enabled him accurc
ately to estimate. In other words,
public speaking is an art to be
learned like other arts.

It is doubtless with some such
sentiments as these that the aur
thorities or many or our colleges
established Departments ct Pub~
lic Speaking. A hasty glance at
Amherst College. as a type of
such institutions, may prove in
teresting to the students of Grlnr
nell at a time when efforts are
being made to awaken new interr
est in the literary societies. Ame
herstCollegc not only possesses
an endowed chairot Public Speak-
ing, but it has even placed some
Courses in Rhetoric and Declanrac
tion among the prescribed studies
at ireshman year. During sophoc
more and junior years elective
courses are offered which demand
constant practice in discussions
and in debates upon subjects rec
terring largely to political history
and to social questions otthe day,
while in the senior year emphasis
is laid upon practice in externpo-
raneous speaking and in the do
livery ot orations.

What makes the Amherst sys
tem unique is the relation that the
Greek-Letter Fraternities sustain
to the college in the matter of
public speaking. The adimu some
times attached to secret fraterni-
ties llas never rightfully existed
at Amherst; on the contrary,
while their m'itmr zi't’llm is social.

Not satisﬁed with the individual

into service, and the poor ireslr

Equally helptul is the criticism
that the upper classmen receive

When it is remembered that
neaily nincrtenths of the students

its loans had been made. From
all that has yet been learned. it
does not appear that there is any
dishonor connected witll the i. ii-

Mr. Eslibaugh was a man or

business cares did not rest lightly.
Proud and sensitive. itsccmsprob-

this business failure unbalanced

Miss Genevieve Otis. ll Esh-

luncral services will be held in
Des Moilles Thursday afternoon.
The body is being brought to Des
Moines by Hardy Eshbaugh, the
oldest son.

Mr. Eshbaugh was married in

becn associated in inﬂuential and
responsible positions with the
most important interests of Montr

there. There was, perhaps, no
more prominent business man in
Montclair.

He has been such a man in all

known him longest and best, Cane
not believe that in his own right
mind he could have taken his life.

The program ot the meeting
last Saturday evening in no way
fell short of the one given at the
ﬁrst meeting. The literary part
consisted of but two numbers, but
each evinced long and carelul
preparation.

0. Risser opened the program
with asclection from VVlll Carle~
tun's “Farm Ballads,” entitled
“Gone with a Handsomer Man.”
This number was decidedly one of
the best of the kind that has been
ottered to the society within the
recollection of the writer, Such
a number requires more than bra
dinary preparation, and the speak-
cr is to be congratulated very
highly on his presentation.

In a wellcwrittcn and interesting
story, Way gave some at his ex—
periences during a cold, winter’s
night. Way has such a unique
manner at prcsenting his numbers
that the society hardly know what
to expect from him, but he always
gives something that is very much
appreciated.

The musical number of the
evening was a piano solo by Miss
Chase, which was quite acceptable
to the society.

The cxtcnlporarlcous speaking
was done by Grier and Owen.
