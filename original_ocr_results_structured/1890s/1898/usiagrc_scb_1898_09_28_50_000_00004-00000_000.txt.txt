l‘ootbull this \tcel: has been

very sloh. fins rsper hapspartly
title to the hot sultry \veitlllel‘, but
the [act remains that it is slower
than it ought to he under any cir-
cumstances. Tlle only exception
to this is in getting on the ﬁeld
In this we must say- that most of
the men. this year, are bettcrthan
usual. But when on the ﬁeld
they apparently think halt their
work done and do not take the
proper inter-est in the other half
The pl'clitnlnal'y work oitaclrling,
etc.. has not been mastered sufﬁci-
ently well as yet and must be per
formed with greater zcal if the
then wish to master it, and be al-
lowedto pass it by and take up
tlrc nrorc intcr ting work.

More interest should be shown
lnklcklng and catching the ball
instead of lolling around on the
ground whcncvcr tllc coach and
captain arc not looking. To be
able to catch the hall expertly is
or high importanco ln a game.
In signal practice we fail to ﬁnd,
in anyvery gloat tlcgrac, that €5~
sential of Glillnell football, speed.
Our teams have always been light
and have won against heavier-
teams chieﬂy by thcrr speed, so
tilts must be cultivated to lts full
est extent. All members of the
teams are too slow in starting and
run too slow and are too ready to
stop when started. The
backs are slower than the |illc~
men in starting. which of course
is needless. They should brace
up in this particular more than
any other. The lirrcmcrrarc slowcr
in running and must put there
energy to thrs. We see too no
necessity in therr stopprng before
the inter-lcrencc line lairly
formed. In fact they should l'lln
each play much farther than they

once

rs

. ence and

 

do.

The guards have the strong

. est tendency to stop before the

formation is complete and/ rn so
dorrrg bleak it up betorc the
others have fallen into their
places.

When lrnctl up tor oppositron a
little more life is apparent, though
it is not what might be expected.
The lntelference here isvery slow
and often so slow that the runner
rs caught from behind. It is ab-
solutely needless over to let. any-
one come in behind the interfer-
tackle. The plays
should be executed so fast. that it
would be rrnpossrblc tor anyone
to catch up from behind. The
blame for this hes chieﬂy with the
lrncrncn, tor the backs must keep
behind their interference if it is to
be of any good to them. The in
tcl'lelence must have more speed,
and until this lack is ﬁlled we can
not have a strong team; so what-
ever else the players attend to we
hope they will keep in mind the
tact that their speed must be in-
creased,

So far this (all there has been
very little baseball playing.
This, like track athletics. is likely
to be lorgotten at this time of the
year, but those intending to play
in the spring should get out and
obtain what practice they can this
(all for it will make a material
difference in their work later.
Capt. Higgs expects to have a
good representation out every
evening now until cold weather
and hopes especially to see the
new men out. Those who have
no suits can obtain them by ap-
plying to the captain. Let us see
all baseball players who are not
working on the track or gridiron
get out in their suits for practice.

Every man who expects to enter
the tall ﬁeld-meet should take ad
vantage of the mild weather and
be out tor training each evening
at 4:15.
