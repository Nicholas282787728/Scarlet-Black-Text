The football practrcc yesterday
afternoon was the last open prac-
tice of the season. For variotts
reasons the inanrlgcnicnt has con
sidcrcd it best to have psi-t oi the
practice for the past two weeks
sccrct and also the tow remaining
practicc games, We wish. horn
ever to say that the spectators
yesterday conducted themselves
in a very satisfactory manner and
it is to ho hoped that next year
when the students altcnd the
practice games they will follow
the example set yesterd.-y. It
wasthe ﬁrst time during the sear
son, when the practice was open
to all, that the crowd did not
hang around so close to the team
that the play was very much ob-
strtrcted and the attention ofthe
players distracted by the con-
tinual talking of the crowd and
appeals to them from the conchcs
to give a littlc more room. A
team cannot keep their attention
on the play and the instructions
of their coaches it their attention
is incessantly drawn to something
else and no practice can be sue
cessitil unless the attention of the
team is concentrated on their
work. The crowd yesterday,
however, kept entirely off the
ﬁeld as though an intercollegiate
game tvcrc in progress and the ef-
fect art the team was very grati-
iying. This may he the result or
having been shut otit of the
grounds tor a time and if so the
secret practice is a success even
though it accomplishes nothing
else.

Another very comrncndshlc
tcaturc or the practice this week
is the fact that thc players have
kept quiet during thc games.
The coach has talked thisinto the
team all the season but this iteek

he has very strenuously insisted
that the players must not talk
This is a dCCIdCd
help and the men should be very
careful to observe it With the
men quiet the signals can be heard
by all without being repeated and
any instructrons of the coach can
be given in unchalt the time, thus
adding very much to the rapidity
of the play.

A few of the men seem de-
termined to talk back to the
coaches and take exceptions to
their Cl‘lHCiSInSr This has been
evident alltlie season and cerlnim
ly seems inexcusable. The play—
crs cannot see what a coach sees
and even if they could it is very
reasonable to suppose a coach
would know best what ought to be
done. It the couch knows less
than the indivtdual player we see
no nccossuy or having onc. Howr
cvcr we think it otherwise and our
opinion is strengthened by the
fact that the veteran players pay
strict attention to all instructions
while it is the comparatively
green men who must be eternally
arguing ovcr some point or other.
It is, moreover, entirely incom-
patible with the absolute silence
that is des' ed in the line.

The criticism that has been so
often repeated in these columns
rs still applicable. namely, the
lack of speed. This ractor has
increased since the game with S.
U, I. but still there is room for
irnprovcnrcnt. we have heard
many rcmarks on the slowness oi
otrr team's play last Saturday and
we think they were iully war-
ranted for the play then was wear
fully lacking in speed. Had it
not been so the result of the game
might have been different. The
backs are slow in taking out their
end men and must pay strict at
tention to this as well as to folr
lowing their interference better.
The line men must increase their
spccd in intcrtcrcncc if we are to
gain groilnd against Drake who
claim to be the champions or ﬁve
states.
