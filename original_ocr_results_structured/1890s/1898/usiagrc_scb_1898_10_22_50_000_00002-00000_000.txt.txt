WITII T1115 issue SCARLET AND
BLACK welcomes a number of new
helpers to its edttorial staff. and is
conﬁdent that its strength uill be
greatly rncreased by this addtttou.
There have been an unusually
large number of vacancies to ﬁll
this fall. and those who are to ﬁll
these positions have shown their
emciency by work during the past
month. While we regret that
there were not places for all who
tried, we feel justiﬁed ill our selecr
tion by the interest and tatthful-
ness that has characterized the
work of those whose names ap
pear for the ﬁrst time at the head
of these Columns.

A VERY pleasant custom has re
cently been introduced among the
young ladles or the college, nnmc
ly, the givtng of receptions by the
larger houses to the rest of the
women at the institution, During
the last two weeks two of these
receptions have been held. one by
the Longshore house, the other by
the cottage. Both were extreme
ly enjoyable. and the number who
attended them showed that they
were appreciated. These recepr
tions are valuable in that they tur-
nish an opportunity for a better
social acquaintance among the
college women, and SCARLET AND
BLACK hopes that they may be
continued.

Tm: A’I'I‘I: '1'10N of the students
needs to be called to the fact that
the annual home oratorical con-
test wtll take place sometime In
December and all who intend to
enter should be at work on their
orattons. The winner of this con-
test will represent Grinnoll in the
state oratorical contest and it is

A' [E request of the football
management we desire to state
that a subscription to the coach
fund was started somettnte ago.
Those who had charge of it tried
to make it generally known that
subscriptions were wanted. They
may not have made everyone ac.
quaintctl with the fact, so we state
It llCl'C. It any are not asked to
subscribe they may close by See
ing Assistant Manager Snider.
This subscription dld not meet
wrth the sttcccss that we would
wish. Comporalrvely lew gave
bestdc those connected tvtth the
team or management, whcreas
the Intljnrity ought to have been
on the other side. This is (its-
trnctively student movement
and ought to teceive the support
ct all. The great pleasure mani-
fested ovel'our defeat of Minne»
sota was shared in by the whole
studentbody and such victories
cannot be won unless theteam
has efﬁcientcoaching. This must
be paid for and all know that the
Athletic Union is ﬁnancially em»
harassed and should be helped
out of this rltfﬁculty. 'l‘hc stu

dents who are not players could
show their appreciation of the
team's work in a very acceptable
manner by subscribing liberally
to this fund, Inasmuch as they
cannot help Wln the games by
actually pluylng they should be
willing to help in 50 direct a way
