The many interesting things

seen a scarlet and black streamer
and an occasional Grinnell yell
would be heard. The wearers of
the blue and white were conﬁdent
of the success of their eleven and
in the training of Coach Potter
and throughout the ﬁrst half it
looked as though their conﬁdence
was well iourided. Drake played
a hard game and it is very evi-
dent that in the future they will
have to be taken into account in
determining the state champiom
ship in iootbali.

Drake made her ﬁrst touchdown
clcvcn minutes aiter the play he-
gan and in another six minutes
the ball was again forced over the
goal line but in neither case were
they able to kick goals although
they were not difﬁcult. The goal
kicking by Peirce was the thing
which saved the score from being
a tie. Both times the goal was

,rather difﬁcult but both times the,

bail shot straight between the
goal posts. The details. of the
contest are as follows:

Grinnell takes the south side of
the ﬁeld and Taft secures the ball
on the kick off. Peirce takes the
ball through the line for 3 yards
and Burd follows with a 15 yard
run around right end. Foster
fails to gain, Peirce takes 4 yards
through the line but in the ncxt
play Drake secures the ball on a
fumble and proceeds to make 7%
yards in two end plays and 5% in
two line smashes and follows with
a run of to yards around the end.
Here Burtl steals the ball and F057
ter and Peirce make 3 yards but
after two unsuccessful attempts
the ball was passed back to Peirce
for a punt. He failed to get it
however in time to make the kick
and the ball went to Drake on
down. By a series of lincsmashes'
they make about in yards and,
then Grinnell holds them on
downs The ball is fumbled how»
ever and Drake secures it. After
making a few yards through the
line and getting within a yard at
the goal McFerin was given the
ball and goes over for atouch
down. Drake, 5; Grinnell, 0. ,

Peirce kicks off and Drake re-
turns it witha punt which Lindsay
fumbles, allowing a Drake man
to fall on the ball; From this
