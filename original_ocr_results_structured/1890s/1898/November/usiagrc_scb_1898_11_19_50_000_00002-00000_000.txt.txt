HARDLY EVER before in the
history of Grinnell football has
‘worse luck befallen a team than
has this year. While we have
not yet suffered defeat the team
has been badly crippled eversincc
it ﬁrst lined up tor opposition and
for the past two weeks man alter
man has been forced to leave the
game until the ’varsity and scrub
can scarcely be distinguished.
Although such misfortunes have
tollowed the team yet the support
of the students cannot be
criticised. From ﬁrst to last
such loyalty has been shown
as could scarcely be tound
in any other institution in the
country, Absolute sacriﬁce has
been made on the part ot some
for the beneﬁt of the team and as
men have been injured and forced
to quit the game, others have
donned football suits and endeavr
died to ﬁll the vacant places.
There is no doubt that the team
has been disheartened and it is
largely due to this tact that last
Saturday’s game resulted as it did,
The spirit, however, which has
been shown by all during the past
week is indeed encouraging and
its effect will doubtless be seen in
the work of the tetim. While the
students will not have further
chance to help by attending pracs
tice games there is one last way
in which they can encourage the
team,‘and that is by sending a
large crowd to Des Moines on
Thanksgiving. Drake will have
a big advantage from the tact
that the game will be on their
own grounds and there is only
one way in which this can be
counterbalanced and that is by
sending a loyal and enthusiastic

The beautiful home of Mrs. and

The spacious parlors were all

with invited guests, who listened
eagerly and attentively to the pro

which her brilliant technique and
