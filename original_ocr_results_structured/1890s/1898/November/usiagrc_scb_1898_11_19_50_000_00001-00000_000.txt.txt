Carlotta-Ellis Debates

The joint meeting of the Elise
Calocagathiaii societies Friday
afternoon was called to order by
the Ellis piesident, Miss Tate.
The program was opened by a v0»
cal solo by Miss Atkinson, which
was very much enjoyed by all,
The main feature of the program
was the debate upon the question:
“Resolved, that it would be more
advantageousfortheUnited States
to maintain a standing army ot
one hundred thousand,”7with the
stipulation that the negative is not
to argue ior, more than ﬁfty thou
sand. The Ellis had the afﬁrmar
tive, Miss Tyex' being the ﬁrst
speaker. She spoke particularly
upon the points of the proximity
of nations stronger in military
poiver, and of the need otstanding
armies tor our newly acquired
territory

The ﬁrst speaker on the nega
tive, Eleanor Morrison, took the
utilitarian standpoint, and showed
that the United States could not
use more than ﬁtty thousand men
in defence of her new possessions
and home interests. She emphar
sized the natural defenses of
America and the need of a navy
rather than an army,

Miss Messinger,in herargument
for the afﬁmative, maintained that
the death-roll would have been
smaller and that the pensionrroll
would not be so great if the army
were composed ot regulars. Miss
Messinger did not show quite so
much case on the ﬂoor as did the
ﬁrst speaker.

Miss Nellie Clarke showed the
harm of a large standing army
from three standpoints: First, in-
dustrially; second, ﬁnancially;
third, morally. Miss Clarke

 

showed great ab ty in debating
and handled her arguments very
skiltully.

Miss smith said that by being
ready for war we could avert it: a
large standing army would give
the United States a stronger place
among the nations; that the mills
tia are not sufﬁcient for handling
the mob element in otir citics,

Miss Helen Starr, the last speaks
er on the negative, spoke for the
most pait in rebuttal of her ops
ponents‘ arguments. closing ivith
a plea tor arbitration and tor the
United States to continue its form-
er policy.

The debate was closed by a
twdminute rebuttal by Miss Tyer,
\Nliile waiting for the decision of
the judges, Miss Edna Proctor
gave a very pleasing piano solo,
responding also to an encore.

The decision of the judges was
unanimously for the aﬁﬁrmative.
It is to be hoped that this will not
be the last debate between these
two societies this year, as this sort
of work is certainly very bene~
ﬁcial to all.

Musical Literary Society

The subjectof Monday's meeting
was "Italian Schools of Singing of
the Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Centuries.” Miss Miller read an
interesting paper, although it was
rather short, on “The Inﬂuence of
these Centuries on Composers."
Through some mistake there was
no music. Miss Sloss gave one of
the best papers of theyear, on the
“Great Singers of this School.”
The current events were given by

Miss Newton.
