W
Bendix-Scott: Recital.

All lovers of music enjoyed a
treat at the Bendix-Scott Recital,
and congratulate the Y. M. c, A,
on the success of the one concert
in the Lecture Course.

The program was carried out
without change, but the audience
were very enthusiastic and all the
artistswere recalled and obligingly
responded with encores.

Max Bendix showed himselfa
thorough master of the violin.
His tones were very pure, and es
pecially in the Mendelssohn Cons
certo and the encore which folr
lowed, he threw himself into the
composition with an abandon
which delighted his audience.

Miss Scott proved herselt to be
a ﬁne accompanist, and in the
Etude by Rubinstein, she showed
her delicacy of touch. Her inter
pretation of the Liszt Rhapsody
was unlike that of most artists.

Miss Osborne has a rich and
poweriul soprano voice, She was
very gracious in manner and her
numbers were well received. Her
last encore. however, was rather
beneath the dignity of an artist.

We hope to have the pleasure
of hearing Mr, Bendix again in
Grinnell, and wish we might have

 

the opportunityof listening to 0th
er artists of the same high order.
We believe they would be greeted
by as large and appreciative an
audience as the one last evening.

Caloca'Ellls.

In place ot the regularprograni
Friday afternoon. Mrs. Stetson
spoketo the two societies together
in Caloca Hall. It was a talk to
women and of women and no one
who heard it could fail to take a
deep interest in the subject which
she presented. She began by say
ing that there is more power and
responsibility in the young women
of today than in the young men,
tor the women have the moulding
of the next generation in their
hands.

The woman is the maker of the
home, and since the right bring-
ing up'of‘ihildren is the must imr
portant part of family life, the
woman should be allowed to
choose the place tor a home
and not have to choose the
locality according to the conven-
ience of her husband's business.
Mrs. Stetson then proceeded to
set forth, by a clever story, her
ideal community in which the
cooking and various details of
house work should be done by
people trained especially in their
line of work, The woman should
have a business or trade and folr
low it after marriage as well as
before. Woman's ﬁrst duty is at
home but it does not end there,
she has a duty to the race also.
Nowa woman should do these ﬁrst
her household duties in the best
way, and to do them all with her
own hands is neither the best nor
most economical way. in early
and uncivilized times everything
was done at home by the hands
of the women. Now weaving,
shoermaking and such things have
gone into the shops where they
belong, but the cooking is still
left in the home and in this respect
we are still in a primitive state.
A man works all day in ashop
and comes to a home at night.
Woman works all day in her shop
and stays in it all night. It is the
business of women to feed the
world, but the best way to do it is
not by private housekeeping. The
feeding of the world is a social
service.

 

The careofchildrcn is a science
and should be learned by every
wom n. Professional labor is
needed here. too, not. cheap, un-
trained nurses. It is the highest
wave of civilization which is car-
rying the woman of to-day into
the arts and trades and all forms
of social service for that is where
she belongs.

Mrs. Stetson then answered a
number of questions asked by the
audience. The talk was very much
enjoyed by all present.

A business meeting of the Calor
cagathian society followed, at
which the following ofﬁcers were
elected for next term: President,
Eleanor Morrison;Vicc»President,
Carrie Denise; Secretary, Alice
Tone; Treasurer, Emma Stuart
Sergeantatarms, Ethel Hunt,
critic, Margaret Kyle; Musical

~Director, Helen Millcrd.

Mrs. Stetson.

The students were especially
tavored this week in being able to
listen to Mrs. Stetson, who talked
on three different occasions at
the college. Mrs. Stetson has
recently come into public notice
on account ot a volume ot poems
which she has published. For
the past two years Mrs. Stetson
has been talking on social probe
lemsthrouglioutthe United States
and in the near future expects to
make a trip around the world
lecturing in various countries.

Her tallcinthe chapel Thursday
evening was on the subject at
“Living" and she gave a number
of helpful and practical suggests
ions on that subject, “Suppose
one should be born,” she said,
”with all the taculties and powers
which one natutally has at twenty
years of age, within a shop where
machinery was going at full blast
and men were running to and tro.
What would one think of it all?
When he came to himself would
not the ﬁrst question which he
put to himself be ‘What am I here
for?’ There would be three things
which he might do, help, be idle,
or hinder. This question is what
every person has to ask himself
when he comes to know himself,
when he begins to learn that he
can do, and that h: is an individ
ual being not guided by parents
