General Reception.

On last Saturday evening oc-
curred the general reception tor-
the new students of the college
and academy, given by the Young
Men’s and Young \Vomcn’sChrise
tian Associations. Thisreception
has come to be an annual event
at the opening of each fall term
and is always one of the most
pleasant of the year's social oc—
casions. The one given on last
Saturday evening was no excep-
tion to this rule. The one novel-
ty of it was the fact that thc men
of the institution who were old
students accompanied the new
girls and helped them to become
acquainted, while the young men
who are new to the college were
the special charge of the young
ladies who have made Grinncll
their home before. This method
helped greatly in becoming ace
quaintcd with the new students.

At the door oithe chapel which
was decorated with golden rod
and other yellow ﬂowers. the stile
dents were received by the prcsi.
dents of the Y. M. and Y. W, C.
A., Mr. Whitney and Miss Fulton.
and also by Miss Rand and two
members of the reception com-
mittee. Miss Callie Denise and
Mr. Frisbie, Before half-past
eight the chapel was nearly full
but despite the iutilrty of trying
to make any progress through
the throng, an hour and a half
was spent very successfully in
making new and renewing old ace
quaintances. Pres. Gates then
spoke a few words in regard to
the pleasantncss of the annual res
ccption and the chance it gave to
the new students of making
friends early in their college
course, and introduced Mrr Chas.
A. Towne of Duluth, who made a
few bright remarks about the op»
portunities of college life.

Fritz Orchestra furnished the
music of the evening and at the
close of Mr. Towne's remarks
they rendered “/Eolian Harp" in
an excellent manner. Frappe
was served throughout the entire
evening by Misses Hartwell. Haw
and \Nillard,_ giving opportunity

for a few minutes rest from the
acquaintance making of the evcne
ing.

The committee in charge are to
be congratulated on their success
in making the reception one of
the most enjoyable ever held,

 

 

The Proposed Men’s Gymnar
Slum.

Tire need of better gymnasium
facilities for the nicn of Iowa Col-
lege has long been felt, and the
feeling has. of course, been em-
phasized by the building oi the
Rand gymnasium for women.
Last spring a movement began
among the students, which, al
though comparatively few joined
in it, resulted in a subscription of
about seven hundred dollars.
Professor Cole and the others who
took part in the Commencement
Concert, united in giving in the
gymnasium the proceeds of that
entertainment, amounting to three
hundred and fortyeﬁve dollars.
This was the situation at the time
of Commencement. Soon after
wards it became known that a
generous friend in Grinnell pro
posed to give two thousand dole
Iars tor a new college building,
and that he was willing to apprtr
priate half of the gift to the men‘s
gymnasium if the project could
be pushed to completion this fall.
In thinking ovcr ways and means,
it occurred to some of thoze in-
terested in the matter. that some-
thing might be obtained for this
purpose from the old subscrip-
tion for a Young Men’s Christian
Association building. The origin
nal plan of that proposed building
included gymnasiums for the
young men and young women.
and it was therefore thought prob-
able that a considerable sum
might be appropriated from that
source to the present enterprise.
To this end, the subscribers who
remain in Grinnell were inter-
viewed, and circular letters were
sent to those in other places. with
the result that the sum of about
six thousand dollars was secured.
Meantime, our friends among the
business men of Grinnell organ-
ized a committee on the subject
and an active canvas is now going
on among the merchants and
other friends here, The result of
this canvassisnot yet fully known,
but it has already added at least
ﬁfteen hundred dollars to the
fund. Including funds on hand
whrch the trustees can properly
rise for this propose, we have now

in sight about eleven thousand
dollars, Plans have been drawn
for a building to cost twelve thou-
sand dollars, and it is estimated

 

that the proper furnishings and
apparatus will costthrec thousand.

It will appear from this state»
ment that we are very near suc»
cess. A visit to Des’Moines dur»
ing the summer led to the pro-
mise by a generous iricnd there,
to, double any sums subscribed in
that city, up to one thousand dol-
lars, that is, if not less than Five
hundred should be subscribed.
At a meeting of alumni and
friends of the college there, a
committee was appointed to try
to meet this offer, but the result
of their efforts has not yet been
Icported. By no means all those
addressed by circular letter have
yet responded and it is reasonable
to expect some additions from
that source, The business men
of Grinnell will doubtless add
something to their already gene
erorrs giits, The project seems.
therefore, so near completion, that
a'vrgorous effort of those most
interested, the students theme
selves, would probably assure it.
It is not yet too late to have
ground broken and foundations
laid, and possibly the structure
enclosed before winter. The
trustees are ready to go ahead, the
moment they are assured of the
necessary funds.

It ought to be borne in mind,
that about half the amount al-
ready pledged comes from

former students, who give to an
object in which they can have no

personal interest. Without any
undue pressure upon any one, it
is fair to expect that those who
will themselves enjoy the advant-
ages of the building should be. ac-
cording to their means, equally

liberal.
