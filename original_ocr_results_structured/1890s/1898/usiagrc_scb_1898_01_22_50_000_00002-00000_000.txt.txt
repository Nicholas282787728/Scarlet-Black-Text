SCARLET AND BLACK has been
quite severely cri cised by some
ofourexcliaiigesand also by sortie
Grinnell graduates, for publishing
only matters of local interest to
the exclusion of more general af-
fairs While we realize that this
criticism is not entirely unwarrant-
ed, we have, nevertheless, a few
words to say in justiﬁcation of our
policy. To us it has seemed (hail
the proper sphere of college jour-
nalism is the college- First alnia
mater and then other colleges.
We have not tried to compete
with the metropolitan dailies; we
have not printed telegraphic news
nor written editorials on New York
politics, nordlscussedtlie llawziian
question. Someofout'excltztnges
do these things in agreater or less
degree. We have considered that
if anyone wanted such news, the
daily newspaper was the place
to get it and not in a college [)tlb-
iication. Our opinion oi Charles
A Darin was not expressed in our
editorial columns because we
thought it entirely out ol place
there, although many college par
pers published long obituaries.
our sole aim has been to I'cprer
sent college life and interest, not
to exert an influence in politics.
We believe we have presented in
a fair way all sides of life here, lit»
erary. social and athletic without
undue emphasis on any one phase.
If general college news has been
too much neglected we regret II
and thank our critics (or the sup-
gestion, and will try to Corlect the
fault in the future. but we still
hold that politics and general
information not connected with
educational institutions is out of

 

place in a college paper.
