l-r IS with great pleasure that
the students see the ﬁne portrait
of Revs ], M, Chamberlain. which
has been recently placed in the
library. Mr. Chamberlain was a
benefactor to the college in more
ways than one, and it is highly
ﬁtting that such a memorial should
be set up in the same place in
which so much of his time was
spent

__——.—

Now THAT the mole skins and
shin-pads are stored away f0i
another season, there is danger
that the athletic spirit will told its
wings and lake a vacation. This,
however. it must not he suffered
to do. We must not forget that
the results oi the athletic contests
in the spring are no less doubtful
than‘were those of the football
season just over. Victory on track
and diamond can only be attained
by persistent and careful gymr
nastic work during the winter
months. The mere fact that we
are going to have a new gynasinrn
in the near future, ought not to
deter us from using the old one
while it is necessary. since the
Y, M. C. A. has declined to as
sume the management otthe gymr
nasium any longer it devolves up
on the Athletic Union to make
the necessary repairs and to put
things in good working order.
The gymnasium ought to be run
with only slight ﬁnancial loss, if
any, and the work is too import
ant to be neglected on any but
the most urgent reasons,
should be organized at once and
the work should be pressed, since
its results will be beneﬁcial to our
spring athletics.
