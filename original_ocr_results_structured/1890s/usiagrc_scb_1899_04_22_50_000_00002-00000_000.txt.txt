Q‘Bhitoriul—

THE RETURN of Odysseus. to be
produced next week at the Rand
Gymnasium, which has been ﬁtted
with a large stage, promises to be
agreatsuccess. Judgingfromthe
time and labor spent on its prepa-
ration it will he the event of the
year and nolle can well afford to
miss it, as it will be as instructive
as entertaining. We think the
Juniors have done well in choosing
a play tontlieir annual instead of
a book, for if the annuals always
took the torm oi a book they
would become tiresome, though
one every two orthree years does
make the most satitactory annual.
To the students in school a play
is always acceptable, as an annual
or otherwise, but on account of
the alumni and former students,
who retain their interest in college
life and cannot be in Grinnell
when a play is given, it ought not
to be the custom for all of our an-
nuals to he plays. The class has
done well in choosing tor their
play something outotthe ordinary
run of college theatricals, even
thongh in does require a much
greater amount of work in prepar»
ing for it.

THE MINSTREL show last even—
ing again gave proof’ of the good
feeling and hearty cooperation ex-
isting between town and college
people. The show wasstarted by
the students and put in the hands
or gentlemen of thc town, who
had charge oi it till it was pro»
duccd last night. both students
and town people making up the
circle. The entertainment was evir
dence of the efﬁciency of those in

Without a dissenting vote the
constitution of the Honor System
was adopted last Saturday nior-
ning. The students as a body
have condemned dishonesty in
recitations and examinations.
They have not only condemned
it but have provided an efﬁcient

and summary method of dealing
with it. It is sincerely to be
hoped that no occasion for the ens
iorcement of that method will
ever arise. If it does, the remedy

will be found amply adequate.7
