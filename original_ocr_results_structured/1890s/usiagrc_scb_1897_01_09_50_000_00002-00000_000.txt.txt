THAT THE promoters of the se-
ries ot subscription concerts have
met with such encouragement as
to ensure success, is a matter of
sincere congratulation to the en-
tire body of students and towns
men, as well as to the members of
the School of Music. The advan-
tages of such a series were well
set forth in ietter
which was issued last term, and
are familiar to most of our read
ers. Yet it may not be out at
place to call attention to them
again. It has been Gl'innell's
misfortune that, while she is so
strikingly favored in her guests
and entertainers along other lines,
there has been a lack or oppor-
tunities to hear musical artists who
stand in the front rank of the cone
cert world, This it is proposed
to obviate by the present assured
concerts, and if their success fulr
ﬁlls expectations, they will un-
doubtedly become regular annual
events. That such may be the
case, we sincerely hope and be»
lieve.

As THE college nears tlle half
century mark, tune is rapldly
thinning otit the ranks of her
friends in tlle early days of strug-

and respected ﬁrst president and
his wife. Dr. Harvey Adams and
Dr. Robbins. two members of the
famous “Iowa Band," have been
called awny.‘ The students of the
present day. and of the past few
years, have had little personal ex-

ever making for the best in life,
which are called up in tribute by
the students of old days, give
some idea of the men and women
whose lives ale part of the college
history. At the semi-centennial
CClel'alIon, toward which they
were looking forward and tor
which they were working, they
will be sorely missed. It
matter of regret that they should
be deprived of the pleasure they
must have taken, could they have
been permitted to be present on
that occasion to witness the restilt
of their sacriﬁces.

The State Meet.

The Des Moines Cnpilalol Dec,
3Ist. says of the prospects for the
state ﬁeld meet: “Much interest
is being manifested this early in
the college year. relative to the
intercollegiate athletic contest to
be waged in May. Grinnell has
been conceded the palm in athr
letics lorn number or years, but

‘ the Iowa College athletes are like»

ly to be outclassea‘in nearly all
events this year, with perhaps the
ekceplion of the bicycle races.
The Agricultural College and the
State University athletes have
made rapid trides in all other di»
rections during the past year and
promi, s to take all the events,"

come richer by a number of most
interesting documents and auto
graphs, presented to the Ul‘llveh

Halvard defeated Princeton in
the debate which was held at
Princeton December. The
question was. “Resolved. that as-
sunlitlg the adoption of adequate
constitutional amendments, the
United States should adopt a sys
tein or responsible cabinet govern
ment." This is the fourth time
that Princeton has been defeated
by Harvard in debate.
