spoke on ”Masquerades” whrle
Mr. Arnold had [or his subject,
“Sophomore Picnics."

Following the extemporaneous

ctety with a vocal solo, which was
well received, and the piayer res
sponded to an encore. The next
number on the program was a
"Conversation" by R, Parker and

something new and very enter
taming. Mr.Risserthenfollowed

question iordeoatc rvas,~Resoived
that Trusts are a Menace to Soci-
ety." Those who were to have
taken part in the debate were
Hamlin and McKeag, but as
neither oi the debaters were pres
ent the society decrtled to have
no debate. The critic’s report

was then given by Mr. Meadc,
who spoke very strongly against
the absence of the members
of the society irom the meet-
ing. The president called for
general crirrcisrn and a mini»
berof those present responded,
indorsing what the critic had said
and at the same time expres~
sing their personal opinions. The
criticism given the members who
were absent does not seem to be
unjustiﬁed, iorsociety work means
society work, especially when one
is on the program At the bnsrr
ness meeting Mr. Hunting was
taken into the society as an act-
ive member.
