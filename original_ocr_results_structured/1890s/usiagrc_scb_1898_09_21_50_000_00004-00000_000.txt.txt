ball candidates are beginning to
practice, it may be or interest to
COHSidCI briefly some of the work
cut out for them this season. The
schedule, although admirably zirr
ranged, contains several vetykllot-
ty propositions, and it can be as-
sured that with our customary
lack of weight, we shall have all
we can handle. The aweinspir»
ing “guards back" play will doubt»
less be encountered in every one
otour big games, and this {act
alone. consideringthc tearrul hav-
oc it wroughtin the last half of
the S. U. 1. game last year, shows
that most thorough preparation is
necessary.

ground at Drake, and will doubt
less use the guards extensively,

also said to make liberal Lise of
the formation. It is, perhaps.
Grinncll‘s misfortune that on at:-

always been contrary to Grinncll's
policyto play moi-ethsn one game
each year with teams thought to
be in our class. The exception in
favor of Drake, it should be stated,
is made largely for ﬁnancial rea»
sons. Coming during carnival

ing the material and the quality of

est reason why Drake should not
be the favorite in the second con-
test of the year, even it it should
chance to meet defeat in the ﬁrst,
which is not altogether probable.

The ﬁrst opposition work will be
given the team this afternoon, the
men being put through lightly [or
about ﬁve minutes. The work
naturally will besonlcwhat ragged,
but several or the new men are cxr
hibiting a zeal which might well
be noted by the veterans. At a
later date, SCARLET AND BLACK
will be glad to comment brieﬂy
on the work of the candidates,
particularly those who appear for
the ﬁrst time this year.

With the opening of opposition

in the nature of a practice game,

than our team, but the Quakers

Whatever the score, their work
