”A man may not always do his
best” Neither may a literary society
which is made up of men, urlless it is
never given the negative inspil atron at
empty chairs.

The Chl‘esto spirit was low; yet
Mollcr gave a good paper on recent
tiction, arousing interest ill the late
works of Stevenson, Crawford, Howe
ells, Kipling, Ba 'e, alld Garland.

Messrs. Williams and Owen dis-
cussed the advisability of annexing
Cuba to rescue her fronl European
bond-holders. A historical essay by
Meade, mingled Mexican development
with the biography of Benito Juarez.
The Misses Wetmore favored the so-
ciety with apiano duct, and kindly
responded to all encore. The extcm-
poraneous work by Core and Velin
was commendable. Miss Florence
Anger’s additiolr to the musical part
of the program was heartily cncored.

Proposed Amendments to the
Constitution of the w. l. A. A.

Through our representative, Mr. C.
S. Williston, ’93, we have been in-
tormedol the further action of the
executive committee ill regard to the
clause ill tlle proposed amendments ill

‘ regard to the exclusion of preparatory

students frolu colllpetition in the Chi-
cago meet.

From his letters we condense the

following: The clause or igillated with
the University of lllinols, where they
have a preparatory department birt
All the mem-
bers of the committee present at the.
last mecung cxcept our representative
were in favor of the clause, bllt be-
cause of the good feeling between
Grinnell and Wisconsin Mr. Waldo of
the University of Wisconsin seconded
Mr. Williston’s motion to defer action
until 1899. This motion will be acted

,llpon at a latter meeting. All of the

larger universities are in favor of tlle
clause and a motion to strike out the
clause entirely would certainly fail.
This action brings tlle matter before all
tlle celleges for actioll, and if we wish
to defeat the clause we must enter ilr
to all active campaign among the difr
fererit colleges composing tlle associar
tiorl. The membersof the association
for the coming year are Wisconr
sill, Michigan, Minnesota, Chicago,
Illinois, Lake Forest, Northwestern,
Del’auw, Grimlell, lowa, California,
Drake, Stanford arid Yankton. As it

takes a two-thirds vote in the execu-

tive committee to pass an amendment
tive votes in the negative will deter
action for another year. The clause
is bound to carry eventually.

Iowa’s Athletic Finances,

Following the communicatron, rc-
feraed to in a recent issue, from the
iowa fachlty committee, comes one
from the student oﬁicers of the Ath-
letic Union. They express themselves
as ill most hearty sympathy with the
purposes of the facility, bllt consider
them to be somewhat unacquainted
with the facts ill the case. According
to their statement committees were
appointed early in tlle year to solicit
pledges of membership and deliver the
pledges secured to the treasurer for
collection. Thus it was hoped every
student ill the University would be
reached. During the celebration fol-
lowing the lowa-Grililleli garrle an
addrtiorlal personal canvass was made
