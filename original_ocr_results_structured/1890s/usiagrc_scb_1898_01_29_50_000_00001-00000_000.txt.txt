tnost impressrvely oti the subject
of power. Power is the problem
of all ages and also the problem
of each individual life. The ilcaier
one gets to himself, the deeper one
goes into himself, by so much he
comes nearer to his God. One
must strip off coating after coat-
iiig at the mere conditions. cir-
cumstances, exteriialities of his
being really to lrnow God. Man
can not even know himself unless
he comes to Christ. Christ is the
completnent of tnari, man tlte
supplement of Christ.

Each one wants power. to be,
to bear. to do. Men cannot

Christianity is in the nature of

of losing the best that is in yoti.
The things He said are true not
