Never before in the history of
Iowa College has such personal ii:-
ducelnents been oflererl the Track

als for this meet, it a sufﬁcient ntun~
her compete, Next spring there
will be four field meets in which
the track team will participate; they
are, Home Field~day, Dual League
meet, State Field-day, and the
Western Intercollegiate at Chicago.
The entire track team willbe taken
to Iowa City and probably to Chi-
cago free oiexpenso to its members.
Gold, silver and bronze medals will
be given [or ﬁrst, second and third
places respectively at the ﬁrst three
meets probably.

Farther, iithe athletes expect IO\V'\

especially in Chicago, they must get
to work at once, The training and
experience that comes from the fall
ﬁeldrday will count (or a great deal
next spring. Every new student
should try some eventi The great
variety of events in track athletics
otters something for everybody.
Every one whom Captain Clyde
thinks may have ability should be
willing to work. Fallﬁeld-day will
be held this year at the fair grounds

beginning at nine o'clock sharp.

But ten days remain in which to
train {or this meet, and no one
should miss a day There is need
of new men in all the races, espev
cially in the walk and the hurdles.
That there are old athletes still in
college, should deter no one irom

College to win at these meets and,

that the new men often eclipse the
old.

The team next spring will pro-
bably be trained by one of the best
coaches in the country, and every
one who expects to compete then
should begin his training 1mm. Let
