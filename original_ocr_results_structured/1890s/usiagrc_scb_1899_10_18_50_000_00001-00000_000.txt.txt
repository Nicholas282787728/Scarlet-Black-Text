There will be an important meeting
of the Oratorical Association on

Thursday at 4:15 in Instrtute Hall. ,
All members are urged to be present. ‘

ARTHUR Rtssen, Pres,

Chrestomathian.

Mr. Mckeag‘ gave his ideas on
”Oratory in Iowa College,” while
Mr. Quaiie spoke on the “Evolution
of the Lightning-Bug.” The ques-
tion for debate was, Resolved: “That
the attitude of England toward the
Boers is justiﬁable.” The aﬁirma-
tive was supported by Dickinson and
the negative by Blodg‘ett. Both
speakers laid special emphasis on the
history of England’s dealings with the

Boers, the treaty rights, and the rea--

son for England’s action. The dc-

bate was marked by a large number
of volunteers, who, like the American
people, took up the cause of the

Boers, Mr. Velin, who acted asjudge,
gave the debate to the negative. The
society their listened to the critic’s re-
port by Meade.

Despite the absence of a number of
the members from the society, last
Saturday’s meeting was one of the
best that has been held this year.
The large mtmber of volunteers in the
debate gave unmistakable proof of the
interest taken in society work.

Mr. Jones opened the program by
giving a review of the “Current Poli-
tics.” He began by giving the politi~
cal condition in Poweshiek county,
following with that of the state, then
the United States and the world.
The next number on the program was
“Pyrotechnics." Mr. MacCarty came
ﬁrst with “Antiexpansion Rockets.”
He said it was his ' 'Iege to attend
some of the antirexpansion meetings,
which were held in Chicago during
the summer, and that he would try to
reproduce some of the arguments
there presented. He spoke in a very
bombastical way, interrupted by the
frequent laughter and applause of the
society. “Bombs in theTrtrsI Camp”
was discussed by Crosby. He began
by giving a history of the formation
of the trust, saying it was the product
of economic conditions, and that our
duty was not to destroy it but to
regulate it for the best interests of the
people.

The society was their favored with
an instrumental solo by Miss Millard.
The selection was well reccivcd and
the player responded to an encore.

lOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL,

Mr. Grrcr spoke on ”Old Glory.”
He, like Mr. MacCarty, spoke in a
bombastic way and “pawed the air.”
“The flag stands for ten things,” said
the speaker. Duringr his discussion
of the ”ten points” the speaker was
often interrupted by the laughter and
applause of his audrence. Extcmpo
raneous work was next taken up. J.
E. l’arker spoke on “Journalism in
Iowa College.” Mr. Crabb spoke on
the “Impressions of a New Member,”
saying he considered ;socrety work
equal to a three hour course in the
college. Mr. Cr ahb gave an intcr‘estr
ing talk, especially when the fact rs
taken into consideration that it was
his ﬁrst appearance on the floor and
in extemporaneous work.

Goodnow Scientiﬁc Association.

It has been occasionally remarked
that students whose major studies are
in the scientiﬁc departments, take
lrttlc interest in the regular work of
the literary societies oi the college.
Whether it be a proﬁtable course of
action or not the fact remains, that
the discussion of questions belonging
to the political or literary ﬁeld has for
such students little charm. Hence, in
many cases they lose the beneﬁt of
,the rsprt'l tie (or/Is and the “assem-
bling together” that are such potent
elements of college life.

The Goodnow Scientiﬁc Associ-
ation, while it has not lrad a continu-
orrs lrfc in the past, has, nevcrtheless,
enjoyed seasons of decided prosperity.
Its work is primarily the discussion of
scientiﬁc questions. Active member-
ship is limited to those who have
completed a minor in science, and
anyone interested in science may be
rpermitted to associate membership.
Meetings are held once in two weeks
.and places on the program are, as a
rule, given with an idea of assigning
a part to the member who has a pecur
liar ﬁtness for it. Students who have
been members in the past speak most
favorably of its advantages. It is the
one student organization in which
members of the faculty are enthusi-
astic and active workers. Students
of one science are not left wholly in
darkness as to what is being done in
others; and the investigation beyond
the classroom work is a valuable
exercise in individual research.

Anyone desiring to join the associ-
atrorr should communicate at once
with some one of the member“ ip
,committee, 0. Risser, Turner and
‘ Dickinson.

 

 

IOWA, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 18,1899.

Gov. Merrill.

I: is ﬁtting that the students’ paper
of Iowa College shotrld contain a word
concerning Mr. Samuel Merrill, who
died itr California last month. Mr.
Merrill was a member of the Board of
Trustees of Iowa College at the time
of his death, though because of his
residence in California for the last ten
years, he has not been able to attend
Trustees’ meetings.

He was a New Englander by birth,
front New Hampshire. He and his
brother, J. H. Merrill, who is now a
member of the Board, were for sever-
al years in business in McGr-egor,
Iowa, brrt for many years have been
in the Citizens’ National bank of Des
Moines.

Mr. Merrill was twice elected gov-
ernor of Iowa. In this ofﬁce he won
universal respect. He was a man of
simple ways and rugged virtues, such
a man as the people of a true demo-
cracy love to honor and may safely
trust, The measure of our regard for
his good works and upright life, and
our respect for his sterling Virtues is
not lacking.

Mr, J. S. Wilson.

During the absence of Dr. Herron
this week, Mr. J. S. Wilson has been
addressing his classes and also the stu-
dents in general at chapel. Last Sun-
day night a large and appreciative gath—
ering of the students heard him in an
earnest appeal for individual consecra-
tion to the great work of social re-
demption, irrespective of personal pref~
erences, whether political, economic, or
religious. In this, as in all his talks,
Mr. Wilson centers the discussion
around the theme of life, its vast sig-
niﬁcance and tragedy and hope. His
morning chapel talks are some of the
best instances we have had of condens-
ing into ﬁve or six minntes’ time some
vital, uniﬁed, signiﬁcant phase of the
general theme of life. His conduct of
Professor Herron’s classes is partly
academic and partly experimental or
illustrative, as for example Tuesday
morning, when he gave a satnple of a
typical socialist workingman’s address
to a supposed audience of workingmen.
In his lectures and addresses Mr. Wil-
son allows abundant opportunity for
questions, which is generally well util-
ized. He Itas arranged for one or two
special conferences with groups of stu-
dents particularly interested in his philr
osophy and work.
