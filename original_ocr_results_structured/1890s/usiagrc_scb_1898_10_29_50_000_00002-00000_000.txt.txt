11' Is with no inconsnlcl'able rer
gret that we see the abandonment
of the NebraslarGliiintrll football
game, but at the same time
cannot but think that the manage-
ment is] stiﬂed in its action. For
more than a week the managers
ot the two teams have been trying
to come to an agreement in regard
to ofﬁcials, and it was with some
hesitation, even when no such
agreement could be effected, that
our manager cancelled the game.
That the securing not only oi
competent but just ofﬁcials is one
of the most important things to
be attended to in arranging tor a
football game, has been sufﬁcient»

costly experience in the past, so
that the policy has been adopted
that unless satistactory arrange
ments can be ‘made in regard to
oPﬁcials, no game will be played.

simply impossible to get the team
to Lincoln in anywhere near prop»
er condition to do battle this af-
ternoon on the Lincoln gridiron.
