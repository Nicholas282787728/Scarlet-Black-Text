Tm: om: element lacking last
night to make the ilitet~society
debate an unqualiﬁed success,
was the presence at a larger and
more representative audience.
Either the students, as a whole,
have failed to grasp the lmPOItr
ance of this event. do not ncalize
the important place which debate
is assuming in college chairs, or
they havesllowntllemsclvcsguilty
of culpable indifference to the
efforts of their fellows, who have
devoted themselves to the promoV
tion of this important interest in
the college, and to the attainment
of laurels {or the college in the
arena of contest. The stride-tits
rnnst individually and collectively
wake up treni their lethargy be»
fore May seventh, or, no matter
how good a showing our leprer
sentatives make, the college trill
be disgraced by the \vaveringsups
port given them in the presence
of strangers. ‘

THE FACT that the spring vaca-
tion comes so lz'tte this year is
liable to have a detrimental effect
upon the work of the track team.
unless the candidates take great
care to keep up their training tluls
ing the vacation. It would be
much better it as_rnany as possibly
can should stay here during the
vacation. The trainer will arrive
the last of this tctm and Will be
here during all the vacation. He
is a good all-around athlete and
the candidates could gain a gleat
deal from him in these ten days,
With Home Fieldsday coming so

early in the term. no time should N

be lost. The meets are to be nu-
merous, for besides the ones al-
ready arranged ter, it is possible
that a dual meet will be arranged
with the University of Minnesota,

H \ientlnv

so that there s no lack of incent-
ive for hard, conscientious lvorlt
and persistent training, A few
men cannot wrri these meets, but
if every student who has ability in
any line would get out and train,
our chances for success would be
second to none.
