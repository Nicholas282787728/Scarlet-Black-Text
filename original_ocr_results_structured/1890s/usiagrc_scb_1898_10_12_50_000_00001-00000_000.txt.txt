Grinnell institute.

The large number of visitors
present at thi: last meeting of the
Griiinell Institute was a source of
great satisfaction to the members.

'A literary society can bc expect-

ed to do the best work when it
knows that its efforts are being
appreciated by outsiders. Tire
highly interesting program which
ivas given on Saturday evening
plainly proved this. It also prov~
ed that football is not destined to
take away all interest in society
work this year.

Mr. Davis in a very instructive
speech set forth his ideas in res
gard to the present ﬁnancial sySr
tern of the United States. He
very ably enforced his opinions by
the usc of statistics, In acalc—
fully prepared paper Eldredge
compared the lives of Europe’s
foimei' rulers Gladstone and Blsr
marck. His subject had been
well chosen, and this paper proved
ot great interest to the society.

One of the greatest treats which
the Grinnell Institute has for some
time had the privilege of enjoy-
ing was a whistling solo by Miss
Brown. Theenthusiasticmanncr
in which it was rcccrved gave
some idea ot how much it was ape
preciated, Miss Brown very
kindly appeared a second time.

swan read a paper on "inter
collegiate Debating" in which he
told how debates were carried on
between the various larger colr

|session which

 

Icgcs of the United States. Curr
rcrlt events were summed up in a
very comprehensive manner by
Parish. A few ofthe items how
ever were given too much in de-
tail.

The announcing of the question
tor debate, Resolved, that Eng-
|.-nd and the United States should
form a political and commercial
alliance. brought about a very
spirited discussion. Higgs and
Engclke supported the afﬁrtnar
tive, while Stevens and Halsey
disputed their statements Much
credit is due the lattcr for so ably
taking the place of Macartney
who was rrnable to be present.
Several of the volunteer speeches
are also worthy of special men-
tion. Pres. Roberts ﬁnally decid-
ed that the negative had been suCr
cessiul in meeting their opponr
ent's arguments. At the business
followed the new
members were initiated A num-
ber otnanics were also proposed
for active membership,

Chrestomathian,

Promptly at 7:45 last Saturday
evening the president's gavel call-
ed the society to order. The ex
treme promptness of the new pres»
ident surprised some of the meme
bers. and they found themselves
just outside the room when their
names were called.

The standard of the work of the
society for the evening was far
above the average. The program
was especially interesting because
it was largely given by new niein
bers. The ﬁrst number was the
news of the week, by Mr. Wylie.
Mr. Wylie is to be especially come
mended because he followed each
item of news with some explana-
tion and careful discussion,

Following the news of the week,
MLJones favored the society with
arcading. This was also Mr. Jones'
first appearance on the Hour of
Chrestomathia, and he gave the
society every reason to believe
that he will become one of its
strongest members. Mrr Owen
came next with a very carefully
prepared talk on the Dreyfus case.
He carefully reviewed the case
from the time that it began, about
fouryears ago; then followed with
a discussion of its signiﬁcance to
French politics. In extcmpora-

 

neous work Crabb reviewed the
present political outlook, and Mr.
Mcadc gave some of his expEIi-
ence as an agent. Following this,
Mr. Quaiic, misunderstanding the
chair, spoltc voluntarily on the
samesubject,grcatlyt0thcanliiser
merit of the society. Mr. Quaife’s
talk was well taken, however, as it
was an answer to the somewhat
more pessimistic view of the sub-
jcct as given by Mr. Meade.

The society was then favored
by a piano solo by Miss Porter,
The music was highly appreciated
by all. Miss Porter kindly rc-
sponded to an encore.

The question for debate was:
“Resolved, that the U. S, should
support Great Britain in her polir
cy of thc ‘open door’ in Asia.”
The amrmative was supported by
A. Risser and Parker, the negative
by Way and Grier. It was aspire
ited debate, especially towardsthe
close. The argument of Mr. Parr
lcer deserves special mention, as
being very logical and forcible.
Mr. Parker is also one of the new
members of the society.

The interesting part of thc blisir
ness session was the vice presi~
dent’s report for next Saturday
night, The committees had ar-
ranged for ajoint meetingwithtlle
Ellis society. The two societies
are to Cclcbrate the fourth next
Saturday evening . The president
of the Chrestomathians is to have
charge of the exercises, anrl ilre
president of the Ellis is to pulse as
the Goddess of Liberty; Mr, Oil'-
erl is to be tlle orator of the day,
aiid Mr. Grier is to read the De
laration. A peanut and candy
stand, ﬁreworks, etc., will be in
order—,in t'act. everything that
goes to make a glorious Fourth.

Towards the close of the bilsi»
ness meeting a committee was ap
pointed to confer with a like com»
nirilee of the Grinnell Institute, to
aitange for a number of joint (lee
brilesrun ’ gthroughoutlhcyear.
This we believe to bc a move in
the right direction, and we hope
to see a great deal of interest in
society work aroused as a result
of this scries of joint debates.
