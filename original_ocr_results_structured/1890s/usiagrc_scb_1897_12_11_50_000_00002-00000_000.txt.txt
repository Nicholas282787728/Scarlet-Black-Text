Review of the Football Season.
(Continued [ruin First Page.)

calamity to the team throughout
all the rest of the year.

Captain coggeshall has played
a very aggressive game at end.
He is very fast indeed on getting
down the ﬁeld on kicks and uses
splendid judgment in evading Iﬂ'
tei-fereucc while bringing down
his man. He has a lolig. cool
head and his shrewduess in direct-
ing the plays of his team has ac»
counted for many long yards
gained during the season and for
at least one victory.

Lindsay at quarterback left m,
tle to be desired. His passing
was accurate, he is a beautiful and
a sure tackler and is always in the
play. At rushing through a bros
ken ﬁeld his equal is probably not
in the Middle West. In the games
in which he handled the‘team his
judgment was cool. he held the
men well together, and showed a
thorough knowledge of football.

Norris at halfback has given a
splendid example of plucky play.
He is specially good in following
interference and shows splendid
judgment and effectiveness in
backing up the line.

Gray has been a great tower of
strength to the team. In offense
his gains have been long and many
and~on defense he has stood like a
stone wall. He is a most difﬁcult
man to down and his use of the
“stiff arm” is phenomenal, Too
much cannot be said in commen-
dation of his work.

Frisbie at tackle was a very cons
scientious and hard player. He
developed rapidly toward the end
of the season and promises to
make a powerful tackle.

The real sensation of the year
has been Gardner-’5 work at guard.
It is certainly remarkable. For a
man weighing only one hundred
and forty-ﬁve pounds his defense
has been wonderful. He is very
quick in breaking through and is
a sure tacltler. He needs coach-
ing in offensive work.

Burd's work has been of the
most commendable order. At
full-back he has been a strong
punter and in quarter-back posie
tion on defense he hasbacked up
the line with splendid judgment
and energy. At end he was spe
cially strong on offense being a
very sure ground-gainer. Aside
from his good playing his example
of faithfulness and self»sacriﬁce
throughout the season was a most
beneﬁcial example to the rest of
the team.

THE scnuu.

Foster playswith good dash and
spirit. He follows his interfer
ence very well indeed and has
made a good showing in his ﬁrst
season. He was unfortunate in
getting out of condition during a
part of the time but showed good
pluck and move at all times.

 

Rule,tt Gtinncll High School
graduate, has proven iiiniseltn sue
perb tackler during the season.
He has played full-back on rice
fensive on the scrub aild seldom,
if evel, misses his man. He has
played substitute half and full
back on the varsity and was for-
tunatc enough to play a few
minutes in both the Ames and
S. U. I. games. His offensive
work was hardly up to his delen:
sive but with added coaching he
will no doubt make a strong bid
for a position back of the line
next year. He should keep hint
sclfin hand better for it is vital
that a player should keep his tents
per under control.

Perry has played on the scrub
for two years. He has been coii~
scientious in practice and proﬁted
greatly thereby. l'llS work this
season has been a vast improve-
ment over that of last year. lfer-
ry plays a good offensive half-
back game and his carrying the
ball during the latter part of the
season was one of tlle features of
the practice.

Knapp, with a more thorough
study ot the game, should ﬁll a
guard position for Grinnell next
fall. He needs to cultivate “gins
gei'.” He carries-the ball well
and ran interference much better
this season than formerly.

Both Blodgett andArnold play-
ed creditable games at tackle for
their ﬁrst season. This position,
as all lt'llOW. IS perhaps the most
difﬁcult to learn of any on the
team. They both helped
nicnsely in the development of
their opponents on the Varsity.
Arnold should make a strong bid
for end next year, should he de»
cidc to play that position.

Selway H without question the
most powerful man who has done
ned the canvas here this year.
He is speedy after he is started,
but the one fault he has to over
come is his slowness in starting.
With another year's training this
fault will probably be overcome,
. Brown, at end, ”the man who
never gets hurt,” played a {care
less, reckless, dashy game. He
was always in the play and was a
hard man to handle. He learned
the rudiments of the game uith
surprising quickness, and forged
his way to the front. Brown plays
ed the Simpson game with
credit to himself and his college

Calderwood has the making of
a tootball player. Faithfulnes
practice, conscientiousness in per-
formancc ot duty and a willingness
to learn. these are the requisites,

and Calderwood possesses them
to a greater or less degree. He

fails however to sttidy his positionl

enough. He played guard this
fall on the scrub and pushed some
of the Varsity men 1131.11 at times.

Baggs also played a good game
at guard, but was handicapped by

l| . ,
ii, weight.

He should play back
of tlle line next season, for he
runs hard and plays a heady game.

Petty, after playing end part of
the season, was moved into tackle,
which seemed to suit his style of
play better. Petty is very ag»
giessive on detensive and his play
improved steadily throughout the
season.

Arnold and Brown, although
both rather light, kept the Varsity
forwards busy and bioke up many
a play behind their opponent’s
Both were erratic at put-
ting the ball back however.

Hulsizer played an excellent
grime at quarter on the defensive.
He is a sure tacltler and an age
giesstvc player, but somewhat
unsteady on oftensive play.

Whiteliill played only the lat
ter part of the season, but dis
played much of his old time dash
anddctermination. Had hepraCr
ticed longer he certainly would
have made a substitute on the
varsity.

Crary was unfortunate the ﬁrst
part of the season and was conic
pelled to leave off the canvas suit
for the remainder of the year.
Too high praise cannot be accordr
ed him for he is a safe, heady

conscientious player, whom it is a
pleasure to watch.

smith, at halfback, played a
dashy game but was handicapped
materially by his lack of beef.

line.

 

shepard improved in his play
steadily throughout and at the
end of the season was playinga
strong game.

Robinson was always on hand
and played with commendable
spirit the whole season.

Haines was playing an excel-
lent game at quarter on the scrub.
when hewas compelled. through
stress ot college work to discon—

tinue football. He was aggress
sivc and steadied the team greatly.

Football in Grinnell.

Previous to i889, the only game
of football known and played in .
Grinnell was an undeveloped form
of the association game. In the
fall of that yeara challenge was
issued by the State University to
any team in the state, fora game
of Rugby hall. For some time
no answer to the challenge was
received; but the Grinnell spirit,
then in its infancy, could not al-
low such a thing to pass unnoticed.
The challenge was accepted. A
ball and a rule book were secured.
and with these and the assistance
of several men who had played
the Rugby game elsewhere, the
attempt to form a team began.

To Louis VanGieson and T. U.
Lyman, ’91, more than to any oth-
ers is due the introduction and
rapid development of the game.

VailGieson was elected captain,
