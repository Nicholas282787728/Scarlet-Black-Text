IT is. as we thinlt. with pardonr
able pride that we speak of the
faithful practice and earnest work
of our team during the past week.
It is one at the traits of human
natureto Strivelot‘greaterachievet
merits when one has been success-
fulin the past. but to continue
striving in the face ot failule and
discouragement one at the
severest tests to which one can
be put. Alter our defeat last
Saturday, following as it tlitl on
the Madison game. it was piedictr
ed by many that out teitm would
go to pieces. That these same
prophets did not fully estimate
Grilinell's nerve in the face of de
feat has been shown in the last
week's practice. In spite of the
inclement weather the boys havei
worked faithfully anti have noticcr
ahly improved their play espece
ially the intelference which was
the best last night it has been yet.
When we add to all
drawbacks the absence of thel
captain from practice it must be
conceded that the team has been
doing up-hill work and is deserv-
ing of all the more plﬂlse. With
another week or tell rlays of such
practice and noticeable improve.
ment there should be no doubt
over the outcome of the Thanks .
giving came with the Des Monies
Y. \1. c. A. team. even though‘
they did come near bezttlng‘ the
Ames giants. The students
should retain as much al-doi- as the
team itself. and should aid it by
sending a largc delegation to Des
Molnes to cheer the Gl'lllllcll team
to victory. That will be the last
game at the year and everyone
who can possibly go shotllrl malre
it a point to be there.
