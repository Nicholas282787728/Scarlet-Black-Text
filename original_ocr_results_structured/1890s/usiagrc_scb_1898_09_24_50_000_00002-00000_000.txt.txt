SCARLET AND BLACK wishes to
callthe attention of the student
body to tlle merchallts whose ad-
vertisements appear in the paper
and to say that other things being
equal it is the duty of all students
to patronize those who are most
friendly to the interests of the
college and who show their friend-
shipinsubsiantial ways, It will
be readily seen item a glance at
the names of the merchants who
advertise in SCARLET AND BLACK
that they are also the ones who
are most willing to aid in athletics
and along other lines. Since this
is the case there is tlle more rea
son why they should receive the
patronageotevery student. These
merchants are thoroughly reliable
and we do not hesitate in the
least in recommending them to
all.

ept. 21. was

THE STUDENTS and citizens of
Grinnell arc to have the oppor
tunity this winter of seeing and
hearing tour ot the most talented
men on the lecture platform in
this country, and three musiclans
who have scarcely their equals in
the United States. This course
of lectures is something which
no student can afford to miss and
the small price at which the tick-
ets are to be sold shoul‘d hinder
no one trom attending. These
lectures should be considered a
part oi college education and
their value should not be meas
ured by the pleasure to be ob-
tained in listening to them.

IT is otten the case with sluA
dents that they think they have
no spare time for anything out-
side of their studies or perhaps
outside of athletics and study, and
on this account neglect some part
of their education, One of the
things which they too readily
make themselves believe they
have no time to take up, is Bible

study. In leaving this out of
their college course they are malt
ing a great mistaltt: to. it hascome
to he a tact acknowledged by all
that one cannot be a thorough
scholar without knowledge of the
Bible. It is astonishing and often
embarrassing even to the students
themselves when tlley are sud-
denly brought Iace to face with
their scant knowledge of Bible

history and truths. Realizingtlle
importance of this line of work,
the Christian Associations in near
ly every college in the world have
organized Bible classes in order
that the students may have a
chance to systematically study
the Bible. In our own college
the two associations have not
been behind in this regard but
have provided good leaders tor
each of the college classes and
have adopted deﬁnite methods of
study. These classes will be held
on Sunday at an hour when Cve
ervone will be able to attend and
when no onc will feel as though
he were taking time from other
work, Let every student realize
that he cannot afford to neglect
this part ot his college education.

Pres. Charles A. Schaeffer.

The laculty and students of
Grinnell College were greatly
shocked yesterday to hear of the
death of I’Ics. Scllaeffer of Iowa
City after ten days of suffering
with gashitis Pres. Schaefter
was widely known as a prominent
factor in our public educational
system, both in thepublic schools
and colleges, but his chief chars
acteristlc was his niatchlcss abilr
ity to manage a great university,
For the last eleven years, as Press
ident ot the State University oi
Iowa, he has had a very great ins
ﬂuence in promoting the standing
ot the university asan educational
center and in securing better
equipment for it. In this latter
respect the State University owes
much to its late president. His
death. coming as it does at the be-
ginning at tile school year when
the duties 0[ an executive are
most important, will be ielt most
keenly in Iowa City. In behalt
of the students of Grinnell Col—
lege SCARLET AND BLACK extends
sympathy to the taculty and stu-
dents ot the State University in
the time of their great loss.
