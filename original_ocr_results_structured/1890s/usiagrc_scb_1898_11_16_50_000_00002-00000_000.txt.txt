Gﬁhitoriul

THE STUDENTS of Iowa College
have never entered largely into
the ﬁeld of dramatic art, but what
ventures they have made upon
the stage have been almost uiii-
formly successiul. The perioi-m
ance ot the “Antigone" drcw
favorable comment from far
and near, while the “Mere
chant. of Venice.” “Lady of
Lyons" and several other standard
plays have been succcssiully pier
sented, to say nothing of the
original production or the class or
'97, Thus it can be easily seen
that histrionlc ability is not want
ing among us, The only question
is how to develop it. Last year
there was some talk of forming a
Dramatic Association. but noth-
ing was done about it and now
the project appears to have drop-
ped into oblivion. It would seem
that such an organization could
well be formed to the proﬁt of all
concerned, A competent instruce
tor could easily be secured, and
plays could be produced atslated
intervals. to the ediﬁcalimlboth of
spectators and actors. If there
are enough woultlrbe Thespians
in the college, this association
might well be made a success.
SCARLETAND BLACK merely makes
the suggestion assoinething which
it would like to see taken up.

Senlor Art Class.
The formation of a class for the
study of art among the seniors is
a step in the right direction. The

college of late has given no chance ,

for study in this line, and the sens
iors are greatly indebted to Pro
fessor Simmons, who has been me
strumental in the formation of the
class, and under whose supervis-
ion it will be carried on, A knowlr

the class is designed for the pure
pose of affording an opportunity
such knowledge. The
means with which the class will
have to work will be limited, the
only art photographs obtainable
being the small collection which
has recently been purchased by
the Ladies’ Faculty club. The
time to spend on such work is also
limited, but the class has decided
to meet every Tuesday afternoon
for an hour or more The ﬁrst
meeting was held yesterday after
noon, and was under the charge oi

on the subject of "Greek Archir
