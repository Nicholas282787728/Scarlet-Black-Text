Dr. Gladden's Lectures,
LABO‘R UNIONS.

An audience even larger titan
that or the ﬁrst evening assembled
on Wednesday evening to hear
Dr. Gladden on Labor Unions. t

The speaker began with a iew
general remarks on the unions and
followed this with a brief histori—
cal account of their organization
and growth.‘ He said tlte unions
had been combated but they con-
tinued to exist, At the outset he
admitted that the methods of la
bor unions had often been vicious
and lawless. But these
abuses of the system.

in speaking oi the historical
development, he noted the form-
ation ot guilds by crat‘tsmen durs
ingthe middle ages, The Masons
stand on the noblest of these
guilds, They were composed of
employer and employed. They
recognized no division oi interest.
Gradually, however, the master
ceased to work with the men, and
the industrial revolution became
a social one.

The history of tlte unions in
England as shown was particu-
larly interesting. In that country
it was at ﬁrst held to be a crime
for the laborers to combine in
unions, Combinationsoicmploy-
ers were not molested by the law.
However, the investigations oi
1867 resulted in a reaction in [avor
oi the trades unions, and in [37]
a law was passed making them lcs
gal. The American unions are
copied from those of England,

The objects of the labor unions
To act as beneﬁt societies;
to endeavor to secure improved
conditions for health, comfort and
safety; to try to secure for the la-
borer a greater share of the wealth
produced. ‘

in speaking of strikes and lock»
outs, Dr. Gladden says that as a
rule the side which ought to win.
He expressed himsclt as
being entirely in sympathy with
the unions in conﬂicts over their
right to combine.

As the two chief criticisms of
the unions, the speaker mentioned
their opposition to prison labor.
and their efforts for the limitation
of apprentices.

In summing rrp his conclusions
Mr, Gladden said: “Violence is

their point without it when in
the right. The people of the
trades unions need to learn the
solidarity of human interests
They need to beware ot narrow-
ncss and clannishncss. and that
they are becoming broader in
their views is shown by their wil-
lingness to arbitrate.

A true trades union is a union
of the employers and the em-
ployed.”

THE CORPORATION.

to them.

Corporations are called “soul~
|ess;” they havc no moral respons
sihrlity. Not only do they oftens
times act in flagrant violation of
what is right, but in his relations
to them the individual is prone to
transgress with little or no com-
ptrnction. The introduction into
society of immoral entities with
which individuals come into moral
relations, brings about abnormal
and morally injurious effects.

The artiﬁcial inequality between
individual and corporation iar sure
passes the natural inequality be
tween man and mail. The cor-
poration is not subject to such
vicissitudes as the individual, It
is not threatcnetl with imminent
disability, its powers do not decay
with years, its plans can be pure
sued through successive genera-
tions of mortal men. It natural
inequalities are so injurious when
not checked in their operation by
the forces of moral conscience,
the artiﬁcial inequality must work
lat greater injury unless its oper
ation is restrained, Corporations
are retarding, not material, but
moral progress. They‘ are killing

the best of the course thus iur.
The speaker laid down as his ﬁnal
conclusion iron. a careful strrdy oi
the question, that the root of the
difﬁculty lies in the attempt to
control a natural monopoly by
the laws of competition.

Since the state has brought
these corporations into existence.
trpori it rests the duty.to regulate
them and the duty to protect the
stockholders. That this has not
been done is proven by the iact
that the practice of wrecking rail-

roads to enrich the directors has
been carried on; and also by the
whole system of private corpora-
tions; and again by the iact that
