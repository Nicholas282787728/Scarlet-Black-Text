The Home Oratorical Contest.

Those who attended the orator-
ical contest on the Tuesday even»
ing before vacation felt more tllan
repaid tor using the precious
hours before the holidays in this
way. It was a noticeable fact
that the college students were not
so numerous as the academy stue
dents, but the latter manifested
their appreciation ot the program
by hearty and impartial applause
tor all the speakers.

The musical numbers of the
program were very enjoyable.
Both Mrs. Vittum and Miss pm,
vost sang most acceptably. giving
variety to exercises that would
otherwise have been somewhat
tiresome.

It would be extravagent praise
to say that orators of the evening
“left nothing to be desired;” all
showed careful preparation. but
not perfection either of style or
delivery. A purist in language
would have had much to criticise
in the diction of the orations, and
a critical master of elocution
would have regretted more than
once that the speakers had not
consulted authorities for the
proper pronunciation of this or
that word. It must be said. too.
that there was a want of natural-
ness in nearly all the speakers.
In the effort to be forceful they
often became artiﬁcial and tire
some; in trying to be oratorical,
they were inclined to rant, or to
maintilin a strained pitch ofvoice.
At times the audience suffered a
sense or fatiguctllat speaker did
not descend to a matter of fact
level. and speak to them and not
at them. But tlleseare faults born
merely of inexperience; practice
and thought will succeed in cor-
recting them.

For the encouragement of the
speakers. it should be said that
all the oratinns showed much
careful thinking. The hearers
felt that they were listening, not
to stale sentiments culled here
and there from the great orators,
but to ideas which the writers had
really made lheirown and in which
they had intense interest. Nollie
ing is more refreshing than to ﬁnd
a public speaker who really has
something to say. We are ine
clined to pardon crudity for the
sake of originality. Those who

 

heard the orators will gladly ti:5e
tity to their enthusiasm and spi ’t.
We may feel proud thatthisspil'it
can manifest itself in intellectual
as well as in athletic contests;
with such earnestness as the
speakers exhibited, we are willing
to prophesy a large measure of
success forthem in the futuie.

The decision of the judges was
awaited with no little eagerness.
and the Final award of prizes
seemed to give general satistac
tion. It is no discredit to the un-
successful competitors that they
were not prize winners, for to the
audience it seenled very difﬁcult
to choose those entitled to the
honors. The honor of represent
ing Iowa College in the state Cone
test fell to Mr. Arthur Risser;
the second prize of$lo was award-
ed to Mr. S. H. Crosby; the chair
manship of the delegation to the
state contest was given to Miss

A Letter From Cuba.

A letter from J. L. Fellows. ’00,
who enlistcd with the 49th Iowa,
was received recently by one of
his classmates, and we take pleas-
ure in publishing a portion at it.
in which he tells ot the trip from
Savannah to Havana.

“We started from Savannah
Monday. the igth, about seven
o’clock in the morning, for the
dock. After about forty ﬁve min
utes’ wait we went on board the
transport Minnewasko. Of course
we were in heavy marching order
and it was a warm day and dusty.
We were glad to get on board and

deck. Our quarters were a go
deal like a cellar but we slept v
comfortably in our hammoc.
We had a large deck and spelt
most of our time there. Our \j'
tions were poorly cooked but as
good as could be expected, The
transports left at noon and went
slowly down the rivei. A big tug
took us out over the bar and well
out into the ocean. Then itpulletl

rounded by water with no land

on our right, and at sunset we
were right even with two large lion

was visible. About four o clock
we sighted land ahead ot us, and
at six o‘clock we could see the
lights of what afterwards proved
to be Morro. Everyone was on
deck cheering and straining their
eyes. About eight o'clock we
came so near to Morro that we sig-
nalled and got a reply. We then
ran up into the harbor. and in the

. bright moonlight could see old

Morro at our left tower up a llune
drcd or so feet. It looked pretty
strong, too, and when we turned

very narrow and it seems as if we
