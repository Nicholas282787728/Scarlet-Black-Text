The lootball {cam is just begin-
ning to recover from a heavy dose
at overctiiifidence adlniiiislei'cd in
tho Minnesota game. The work
the past ten clays has been ex-
trernciy ragged, particularly on
the defensive side, The scrubs,
during the‘ past three days, have
been able to make good gains
through the varsity line, although
their efforts to circle the ends
have met with little success. It
is true that the varsity has been
badly crippled by the retirement
of four or ﬁve men on account of
injuries. But it must be borne in
minrl that when these vacancies
are ﬁlled by men [rain the second
team that the latter is handicap—
ped even more than the varsity.

There is now apparent in nearly
every play a sincere effort to get
the proper formation but the ct-
loit lacks. thus far. the essential
of snap. Griiinel] isliglit. It
can make up for its lack of weight
only in speed. There has been
speed neither in the line smashes,
the end runs nor the lemgo/rzg-
nrtzs. The signals have been calr
led by Captain Peirce, Lindsay
and Burd, Neither one crowds
the play enough. We can have
no success without fast work.

The scrubs have been very inithr
tul in attendance at practice and
are making every day an honest
effort to give the varsity effective
opposition. in our present crip-
pled condition several otthc scrub
torwards have excellent prospects
ofplayingin the S. U. 1. game.
Capion is on the sick list with
tonsilitis, while Thiel has water
on the knee. Gracser is greatly
handicapped by “Charley horse”
but it has been absolutely neces-
sary to play him on account or
the bad condition of the men,

 

Captain Pcirce. also, is much in
need of rcst for his injured leg
but has stuck faithfully to practice.
Thus it dévolves upon the substi-
tutcs to make an extra eiiiii-t the
coining week to perfect their play,

The result of tilt: Dinke Anies
game was a genuine surpi ise. All
expected Ames to win but it was
hardly thought Drake would be
able to score. Captain Peirce \vitr
nessed the contest and was stngr
gel-ed by Drake‘s desperate stand
against the superior training or
Antes. The Des Moincs men
were slow to wakc up but iii tlic
last halt played with irresistabic
dash. Their mass work is des-
cribed as almost faultless, Grin-
ncll can rest assured that it has a
large sized contract on its hands
for Thanksgiving day.

Grinnell will play Penn tomorr
row atOskaloosn. The Quakers
have in Pdilcer and Hester a res
niatknbly last set oi backs. Howr
everI Gi‘innell should not scale
less than 30 points and should
Penn cross our goal it will be con-
clusive evidence that Grinncll’s
defense is weak,

The State University is playing
its usual ragged balk—stite kind of

ball it plays everywhere ex-
cept in ttic Giiniiell game; the
kind or ball it played against
Kansas and the kind it did not
play Nov. 20th. it will be the
Same old story. The university
has received its piellniinary lick»
lugs and will now proceed to
round into torrn and give Grins
nell the battle of its life.

A memorial gate costing 53.000

is to be erected at Columbia Ulllr
