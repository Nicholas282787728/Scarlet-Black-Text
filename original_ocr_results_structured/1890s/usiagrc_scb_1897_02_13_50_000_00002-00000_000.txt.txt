THE rue-r that so little time for
work, independent or the cla
room, can be taken by the protes-
sors in our college, adds to the
pleasure ivc take in noticing the
universal praise won by Professor
Macy's rreiv book, which we merr
tioned last fall when it went to
press, The work has won irriqtial.
iﬁed praise lrom scholars ot inter-
national reputation, the reviews
have been unitormly complimen-
tary, and the college has shared
in the honor of the author. The
work goes a long way toward wine
ning trom the outside world one
recognition ot the scholarship of
the faculty. The students will
watch with keen interest the re
ccption of the book, which from
present indications \Vlll be lemarkr
ably tavorable.

As THE work or the spring sea
son approaches, it becomes deeid»
edly imperative that the ﬁnances
of the Athletic Union be bettered
in some way. One of the most
strrlrirrg facts, revealed by air c-
amination of the union records, is
the comparatively small member--
ship. The cost of membership in
the union is not so great as to be
onerous to any one, and there is
no reason why the membership
should not be double or treble
what it IS. There is no sttrdent
who does not take pride in the
athletic slandlng of the college,

. l
and who does not Wish to see our

prestige maintained. But the Stu»
dent body is not surrrciently rep
resented in point or number in
the Athletic Union, which controls
our athletics, and this state of at-
fairs should be remedied at once,
by a decided increase in the mint.
her of members.

The subject ot’ the lecttrre
Thursday was ChristianSocialisnr.
The speaker laid especial emphar
, , upon the need of social rightr
eonsness. He said that the indie
rich should not Be
llouted; that to day, as far as in‘r
dividtral action is concerned, the‘
man at ii-ealtlr is trellnigh as help
less as the poor man. The neceSr
sity of combination had been
forced upon all lines of industry;
and the solution of the socral
problem is to be round in ceroperr

He said that cooperation had
provcn more practicable in Eng-
land than in America, since Engr
lrslr people are more amalgamated
than American, who have hither
to had boundless opportunity tor
individual action. He also be»
lieves that municipal functions in
this country should be expanded
as they have been in Eur-ope.

Rev. Mr. Bliss sharply distin»
guishes socialism from anarchism,
paternalism and utopianism. He
tlctends the position of the theorist
who is not blinded by the smoke
of conﬂict, and is therefore able
to View present problems thorn
ougllly and impartially.

The lecturer given the
closest attention by his audience,
and his presentation of his views

new rules. The baseball team
will lose some of its old and most
reliable men.
