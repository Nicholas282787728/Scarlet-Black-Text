The program. ”Wise and Other
wise," given at Calocagathia Fri
day afternoon. was very dinet-ent
from what it usually is. It was
raliler ot a high school order. but
was interesting because it varied
our customary idea of the society.

Miss Hartwellrccited‘“Mongst
the Hills of Somerset.” The
selection was short but was very
well given. and showed that Calm
cagathia has strength along that
line although it is seldom used.
Miss Scanlmon's paper, “Grnve-

unique iii the way at a society par

The Home Meet.

The annual home ﬁeld meet
met with the same fate which
seems to await spring athletic

postponed on account of rain.
The track was East. the number
of entries large. and evcrytliing
pointed to 0th of the most inter-
esting meets which has yet been
held. out belol'c the events had
got fairly under way. a heavy
showcr dampened tlic artlor ot
contestants and audience alike.
and put all thought of a success
inl meet out of the question. But
two events were ﬁnished. In the

three places. The shot put was
under way but when the contest
ants were unable to distinguish
the shot from the had stones
that covered the ground it was
decided to postpone that also.
The meet will in all probability

be ﬁnished between dual and state
