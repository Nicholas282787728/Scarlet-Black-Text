The Trustees at their last meet-
ing,after considering the needs
ofthe College, decided that at
least 8350.000 was necessary to
meet the immediate necessities
for enlargement,7one hundred

this may be drvrded as follows:—

This may seem lit-c a large sum
of money. and so it is, but “a
strong pull, a long prrll, and a
pull all together" on the part of
every graduate and trierrd, can
surely add the above sum to the
resources of the college.

How can it be done? Some

the track management is the lack
ot spirit shown by the old men.
But few have shown up for regllr
lar worlr and if we are to send out
a winning team next year, there
must be a change trorn the pre-
sent lack of interest shown. The
fall training is of great beneft to
the men and should not be omit—
ted.

Our last season's coach, J. P.
Watson, writes from the east say-
ing, “no sure and have the boys
work out on the track this fall."

Now let Every man. both
and old. be out to make Grinnell's
next year's team what it has been
in the past.

The annual fall handicap meet
will probably be held on Oct. 23.
Liberal handicaps will be given
so that every man will have a
show of winning. Medals will be
awarded by the Athletic Union to
winners at ﬁrst place.

Since it is from these (all mccts
that malte the estimate of
what the next spring team will be
let every man do his best to make
that estimate this year as good a
