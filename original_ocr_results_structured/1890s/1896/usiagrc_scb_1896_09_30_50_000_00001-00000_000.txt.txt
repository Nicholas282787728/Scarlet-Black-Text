Presrdent Gates’ Address.

t The President addressed the
students of tht: institution Sunday
afternoon upon the general theme.
--Wliy study the Bible?" During
tlle hour he proceeded to answer
this vital question to every stir»
(lent. along three lines ot thought:
First. we study the Bible to be
come acquainted with its Irtera»
titre; second. to be a fairly weir
educated person; third. in order-
to ground ourselves on the reali-
lies of hte. He saitl in part:

“The Christian who has not con—
ﬁdeuce enough in lIIS Bible to be-
lievi: that it can stand any com»
parison, has not really any taith
in the Bible at all. I, for one. say
franlrly that I want the best book
in the world tor my guide. con»
stquently if a better book can be
found tllan the Bible. I Will disc
card the Bible for it at any ino-
rnent. I may have conﬁdence
enough in the Bible to believe that
no better book can be found or is
ever likely to be written, britl
must still hold that it it were pos-
sible that a better book could be.
I must give my allegiance to the
highest and to the best.

“We see then at once that the
real ground of the authority or
this book is something more than
man's 7px: draw. and rests on some»
thing inﬁnitely stronger than the
vote of its aritlioritativeness by
any body of men that ever lived.

* r Its authority is declared
to bc not in the opinion or man.
btit of God. and iii the trtith itself
which the Bible contains. The
ultimate appeal in respect to any»
thing whatever, Christian truth
and all other truth, must be to the
lurman spirit itself. » * God
gave man his common sense; it
(the Bible) does not exist as a
substitute for it. There can hardr
iy be a more a irrational View, than
those which have sometimes been
set forth, that we are to follow
our reason until it leads us to the
Bible and then give irp our reason
and use the Bible instead. It is
very strange that sensible people
could ever reason like that. The
Bible taltesjust the opposite view.
It says. ‘Come let us reason to»
gcther;' and again. ‘Test all
things and hold fast that which is
good.’ Now there is no ultimate
test but the use of all the highest

Grinnell Institute.

After the installation of ofﬁcers
for the fall term and the presi»
dent’s inaugural. Hart opened the
program with News oi the Week.

Brown followed with a wellr
prepared and extremely lttlerestr
ing paper on the question of Cape
ital and Labor. Tire speaker was
thoroughly in sympathy with the
cause he espoused and his pre-
sentation of the case was strong
and convincing.

After two charming vocal rrum
bers by Miss bray. Temple pl'Cr
sented an excellent review of Dttr
Maurier's new book.

Marsh toilowed with a speech
on the crisis ill Cuba and Armenia.
which in view of the short notice
given him tor preparation. was or
surprising merit. and was one of
the most commendable numbers
of the evening.

The externporaneous work was
of a kind worthy the palmiest
days of the Institute. Sargent
spoke on "The Signiﬁcance of the
Yale Demonstration at Bryan's
Speeelt;" McHose. on "The Place
for the Student in the Present
Caliipalgn;" and Bean on “The
Institute in ’9273.”

The entire program deserves
the highest praise. and formed a
most auspicious opening tor the
year’s work. The members have

taken hold of the work with (lee
termined and enthusiastic zeal
and the indications are that the
Institute will this year reach the
old standard.

In the business meeting Allison.

creary. Rickerand spanldingwere

“This their is the ground of au-
thority on which the Bible malres
its appeal to man. It is the truth
inherent in itsell that needs no
codtllrng. that needs no tleiense.
It only asks to be proclaimed; it
will make its own way it it can
only get a heating,

“The end of the Bible is to
bring its not to itself. but to jesus.
It is the heart of Jesus Christ with
which we here come in Contact."

Throughout the iiliole address
the speaker insisted upon a sys-
tematic. scientiﬁc study of the
Bible. To study the book in a
scholarly way. we must come to
it. laying aside our prejudices corr-
cerning it. and approaching it with
the desire prirrlaiily to ﬁnd the
truth in its pages But our stutly

will of cotllsc be reverent. I'cmem»,

gone before and the comfort and

The Cltrestolltitthiitns opened
up their year's work with a good
program last Saturday evening.
which was I ~tenerl to by several
visitors bcsrdc the members. iri-
ciuding Professor and Mrs, Noble

Aft. JACKSON, Nogi - NARD,

COLLINS. CKAHB.

The ﬁrst number was an excel-
lent criticism of a new work the
titled “Romance of 3 Coal Mine.”
The theme of the oration was the
idea of ”Right Seeking of the
Best Things." The paper by Mr.
Hill was a criticism of an article
in the September Furl/m by Dr.
White on the general theme of
Providence and Mechanism. This
number evrdently represented the
most thought and painstaking
preparation of any of those on the
program. The soliloqiiy was well-
written butimperfectlycommitted.

The extemporaneous work was

 

lll charge of Smith and Gray. the
tormer speaking on the “Chinese
Viceroy. Li Hung Chang.” and
the latter upon ”Political Bolts in
the National Conventions of this
year."

All tour speakers on the debate
appeared with arguments to prove
their side of the question, the de-
bate iesulting in a victory for the
negative.

Mrs. Prot. Noble very kindly
varied the program with an instru-
mental solo. which was well appre-
ciated.
