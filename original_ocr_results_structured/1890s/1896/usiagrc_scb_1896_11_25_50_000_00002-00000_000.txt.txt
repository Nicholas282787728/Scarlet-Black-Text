1'rl5 a matter of speculation to
many students as to the exact
standing of the College Press As~
sociation at the present time. The
Association was organized some
three years ago and for a time

was quite successful in its work,‘

but last year the interest displayed
by its members was at the inter
mlttent variety and consequently
what \iorls was accomplished was
of little value. So far this yeah
nothing whatever has been done
either toward perpetuating the
organization or- carrying on its
work. Twice have notices been
posted calling a meeting butno
meeting has been forthcoming.
The largest number ot members
yet assembled together in one
place at the hour announced has
been four. What is the reason tor
this indifference? If the mem-
bers do not desire to continue the
organization longer it certainly is
not unreasonable to demand tirat
they so express themselves 'as to
leave no further room for doubt.
/It on the other hand they do wish
to continue tlle association it
ought not to be necessary to Come
ment upon their absence from the
meeting. The present state ot in-
activity is inexcu- ble. Whether
it shall live or die is a question to
be decided by the members. and
a meeting will shortly be called
to act upon this question. Will
the result be hali a dozen nlemr
bers present or nril it be a full
representation?

To-iluRnow A th‘oox at Des
Moincs occurs our last football
game ot the season and by it is to
be judgcd largely wlietllcl' this
season is a total failure or not.
During the preliminary practice
this fall, it was rearllly lecoanized

. team “as

. injury and consequent retirement

.lthe playe‘ls have seemingly lost‘

that our prospects for the season
were not the brigl itest. But three

last years regular team ape
pearcd and most of the new mar
terial “as far from proriiinngi
lTlle task oi evolvmg‘ a ﬁrst-class
tremendous but the
management went bravely to work
and for a time their efforts ap-
peared to be crowned nith sue.

iflom the game a most deplorable
:slump was noticed in the work ot
ltlte team and in the spirit shown
.byt he players This culminated
in the disgraceful defeat at the|
hands of Anies in Des Moines two!
weeks ago, This seemed to arouscl
the men from their lethargy and
in the S. U. l. game they demon-i
strated that they could play ioot~
ball. Since that time
there has been again a tendency
on the part or players to slighti
their work The last week especr‘
rally practice lies not been up toi
‘_the standard, Two or three oil

however

all interest in the team's welfare!
and have repeatedly failed to ap-lJ
pear on the ﬁeld dressed for play]
What excuse they have is far lln~
obtainable. Without excus it is
certainly conduct unbecoming a.
Hum. The undergraduates ol' thel
lcollege and the alumni in this and
other states are looking to this
last game of the season for the
team to regain its lost laurels
‘But it seems that the team itself
1is utterly lacking in any such de-
‘re. Whether this be true or not
is an open question but opinionsi
inltlst necessarily be termed ironr
rthe shoiiing made to niorrow
lerether these opinions will be

 

itselt to decide. 1

Faculty Football Action

The tacul ty resolution on foot-
ball which was reported in |ller‘%
Des Moines and Marshalltown
papers is not so tor reaching in
its effects as has been thought.
The resolution was to the effect
that hereafter no minor attending
college shall play in the intercol
legiate football gameswrthout thel
written consent of his parent or
guardian.

The action was taken at the
close of the season to avoid mis-
understandings with the footb'alll‘I
department ofthe Athletic Union,
and to cause them no inconvenir
ence. lt’is not to be construed
as discountcnancing football
the school. but is simply meant:
to secure deﬁnite understandingl
between the facility and parents.
it is not anticipated that it will}
have perceptible effect upon the
game itseli in the school ‘
l The wirn'calls the University ofl
Chicago football team --an aggro
gation of professionals, semirpro-l
fessionals, and one or two strrctlyl1
iamatem iootball pla'yers." i
