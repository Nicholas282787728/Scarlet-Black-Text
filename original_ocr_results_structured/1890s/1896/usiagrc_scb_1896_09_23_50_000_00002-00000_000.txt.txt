Qﬁhitoriul

THE ANNUAL reception of new
students was more largely atteude
_ed this year than usual, showing
that the pains talten by the Y. M.
C. A. and V w. c. A. were ap.
preciated. These receptions are
tast becoming a prominent feature
of college lite, coming as they do
at the opening of the school year
and thus giving the ﬁrst impetus
to the social life of the college:
They able means for
'lurnishing stoncwsluclcnts
to become acquainted with each
other as well as with the older
ones, and for the old students to
renew their torn1er acquaintances,
dropped temporarily during the
summer vacation, The feature
chieﬂy commendable is the lack
of constraint. so common to gath-
erings of the kind. The music at
the reception last Friday evening
added much to the general enjoy-
ment and proved that a musical
program would be very acceptable
as a part of the regular entertatne
ment.
