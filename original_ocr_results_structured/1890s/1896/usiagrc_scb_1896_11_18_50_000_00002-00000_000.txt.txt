\Nv. CALL attention to the one
nouncernent ot the ﬁrst lecture
tliisyear. whicll is under the math
agement of the Y. M. C. A.. and
which will be given under the Y.
M. C, A. plan of admission, The
success of this plan in recent
years has been due tothe caroperr
ation of students and town friends.
The continuance of the plan this
year will depend on the loyal
support of every student in the in
stitution. The course selected is
certainly up to the usual standard
and will therefore merit a just
share of our attention, These
courses horn year to year can be
made to form no inconsiderable
part of the education received
here.

THE RESULT of the football
game last Saturday was indeed
gratifying to the supporter s of the
scarlet and black. Although credr
ited to us as a defeat. in some ier
spects it must be regarded as it
victory. Prior to Saturday a
strong suspicion to the el‘fect that
the boasted Grinnell spirit in loot
ball had become extinct. was wide-
spread. but the blavc stand made

by the team in the 5. U. I game'

will go a long way toward refut-
ing that opinion among alumni.
Although vastly out-classed
point of weight and age. the Grin-
nell boysplayed as plucky a game
as was ever put up on the Grinnell
ﬁeld. and by their deeds showed
that they posses d the s
it which on many occasions has
brought Victory when tlctcat
seemed inevitable.
