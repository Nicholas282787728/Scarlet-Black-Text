STUDENTS certainly should need
no urging to take advantage of
hearingthe address to be given
by Rev. Is. Wilson of Chicago
inthe chapel tomorrow evening.
Rev. Wilson is a graduate of
Northwestern University and also
of Garret Institute. Soon .after
completing his education be be
came pastor of one of the leading
Methodist churches oi Chicago
and was meeting with greatest
success when he gave up this
‘work to become head of the
Northwestern Social Settlement,
which position he held for a num-
ber oi years. Recently he. has
allied himself with the Social Cru-
sade, with which he is doing much
good. Those who heard Rev.
Wilson's sermon at the Congrega-
tional church last Sunday will un-.
doubtedly take advantage of this
opportunity and others will do
well to follow their example. He
will have charge oi Prot. Herron's
classes next week at which a lim-
ited number of visitors will cer-
tainly be welcome.

1901 Picnic.

Westﬁeld was. last evening, the
scene of one of the most pleasant
social gatherings the class of [901
has ever held. Two large wagons
conveyed the crowd to their LleS'
tination, wherea lunch of sand
wiches, coffee, wienerwursts and
pickles was served. Arter supper
all gathered around the campﬁre
and an impromptu program was
given, consisting ol two very
pleasing readings by Miss Herr
derson, solos by Macar-tncy and
singing by the cl-owd. A more
beautiful evening could not have
been chosen for such an event
and when home was reached all
felt that. this would be one of the
events to be long remembered in
the history oi 'or.

Song Recltal.

A rather small but thoroughly
appreciative audience greeted Mr.
Francis Fisher Powers at the Con-
gregational church on Wednesday
evening, The smallness oi the
audience is very much to be re-
gretted, for seldom do we have a
singer of Mr. Powers' attainments
andreputation come to us. The
program which he selected was
admirable in every way, giving
ample opportunity to display
great variety in styles and inlet»
pretative powers. Mr. Powers
voice itselris one capable otthe
widest range oi expression and
power, from soitesr pianissrn—ro to
dramatic fol'tissimo. This varies
ty was possibly best shown in
Liszt's dramatic setting oi the
popular German poem, “Die
Lorelei." The soil. tones of the
upper part ot his voice are sur-
passingly sweet and srn‘ooth.
while his lower tones have all the
power and resonance ofa heavy
bass. It must be a voice ot very
unusual compass. Any notice oi
the program would be incomplete
without. mentioning Handel’s see
rcne ara, "Where'er you walk,"
Jensen's “Murmuring Breezes,"
with its healthful melody and no
phng accompaniment. and Gerrit
Smith's exquisite setting of "The
Night has a Thousand Eyes," all
of which were sung with the deep
feeling and taste that bespeak the
genuine artist. Mr. Powers made
many friends in Grinnell by his
splendid singing and charming
stage presence and we shall be
glad to hear him again. No small
pleasure was added to the even
ing's program by Mrs. Cole’s ar-
tistic accompanying.

One of the most important
eventsin the history of S. U. I.
was the inauguration of preste
dent Geo. E, MacLean, which
took place on Sept. 29. The cere-
mony was held on the varsity
campus, seats having been are
ranged for about 3,500 persons.
Among those who took part in
the exercises were Gov. Leslie M.
Shaw, Pres. Harper or Chicago
Universit , President Northrop oi
the University of Minnesota. and
Pres. King of Cornell College.
