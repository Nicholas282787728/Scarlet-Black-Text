The Rand Lecture Course this
yearconsistsofaserlesofaddress~
es on “Municipal Management in
Great Britain," by Mr. J. W. Mare
tin, of London. The lecture Suns
day evening was qtiite largely his
torical. treating of the growth of
the London county council.

The power oi London ivas ior
many years dreaded by the Eng-
lish kings. with the result that it
was not until ten years ago that
the city was given a central gov-
ernment and became a province,
as it were. This was the oppor
tunity for reform of existing
abuses. A retorming element
gained control in the council, and
as a ﬁrst step had the council ap-
point men ot special ability as at-
dermen. They were specially tor-
tunate in the selection of the ﬁrst
board of aldeimcn. After three
years a broad social program was
laid out. Then came the election
with the reform policy as an issue.
It resulted ill a sweeping victory
tor the progressive party. Tlrisis
the more remarkable when it is
remembered that on national
questions London is very conserv~
ative. National lines were broken
down and the issue was to protect
and aid the poorer classes.

The principal iv nlrs ml the corrii
cil utrt»: Fll‘\l. the tslitblisliiirtnl
of public parks iri convenient and
needed places tor the working
classes. Incidental to this came
up the reform of the refreshment
booths and their control by the
city, and also the giving oi tree
band concerts in the evenings.

Second: The existing weights
and measures used by dealers be
came subject to a strict public in-
spection, with results greatly ben-
eFlclal to the poorer classes.

Third: In the matter of 5a
loops the council adopted the pole
icy of putting an end to all saloons
on property which they owned.

Fourth: The subject of work
men's trains was agitated with such
success that now at morning and
evening special laborers' trains are
run at very low rates. which make
possible tor the working classes a
cheap suburban life.

Filth: Perhaps the most ad»
Vance has been made in thc edu-
cational system.

 

board of education has a, large
sum annually for technical etluczl»
tiou. By a Cnmpetitive system
scholarships ol two years
5100 in cash are open to those who
really need help. For the VCI'y
poor an additional stim is given,
representing the which
would have been In the
mean time.

Sixth: The street railways are
now passing into the hands of the
public. The twentyeone—y edr lra‘ne
chise having expired, the north»
side lines were leased apnin; oii

the south side, however, the corri-
munity through its aldertiieti both
own and operate the lines. The
tares have been reduced, the lines
extended, and a surplus fol school
purposes accumulated

In connection with these vari
ous undertakings has grown up
the department of public works,
by which letting the work to con
tractors is avoided, a savlng oi

is made, arid a better grade of
workiillvariably obtained. This
experiment has been called revo-
lutionary and socialistlc, but has
succeeded only in preserving tor
the citizens the public advantages.
It has been proved that a com
munity can use a central and etc
ﬁcient power.

the Municipal Corporation ttct.

in l832. The conditions then were
much the same as extsl in the
United Statestoeday, v , the pei-e
version oi municipal p ivileges
ior political purposes and the Sllbr
ordination of good city govern-
ment to national politics.

The executive power of a city
government lies largely with the
three bodies, council, school board
and aldermen; the ﬁrst two elect-
ed triennially and the last chosen
by the eotlthll.

Tllc most slriklng teaturc com»
mon to these three is the question
of election. Ntimillatlons mt’H be
made by any -

conventions. Of immense advan»
tage also ior good government is
the [oz/Were separation of city and
national politics. The lines of is-

city's business. This spirit oi der

dispensable.
TUESDAY.

Besides the soecnllcd clemen-
Ull‘y of city govern
ment, the British have many titll
ers which by Amerlr‘rms are CUII'
sidered as outside the split-re oi a
city. As a rule the cities have
shown more enterprise than prie
vate corporations. Among these
the water question has received
ﬁrst attention. Glasgow, Birming-
ham, Liverpool and Manchester
have assumed contl 01 of tlte water
supply, with a reductiontof iully
ﬁfty per cent, in rates,

In respect to lighting even the
small ctties make large proﬁts on
their investment, and that, too,
while at the same time reducing
the rates and establishing a sink-
ing iund. In 1883 there were I33
municipal gas companies in Great
Britain; iioiv there are 203. For

than the private companies.

In I395 parliament gave cities
the power to own and operate rail-
ways, and the power to buy out
the etcisting companies at the ac-
tual value of stock, Since then
the movement, notably in Glas-
gow, has been a' gradual supplant
lug of private companies by inu-
nicipal ownership and operation.
This has proved thiis tar a very
proﬁtable enterprise for the city.
The fares have been reduced to
one cent for short distances, and
even less proportionally tor lonp
distances. Even then Glasgow
