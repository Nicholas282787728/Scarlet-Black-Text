The program Saturday evening
was opened by a talk on The Pro-
gress oi the Month ot March, by
Jones. Mr. Jones spoke ot the
questions of international interest.
mentioning the outlook tor Eng.
land's “open door" policy in China;
the condition ofaffairsin the Phil-
ippines; England's African pro-
grain.'etc.

The music ot the evening, a
piano solo. by Miss Stickle. was
renderediiiavery acceptable mane
ner. A hearty encore was kindly
responded to. '

Mr. Leonard, in a very well pre
pared paper presented a study of
Praxitlles and his work. The
characteristics of the Praxitilean
age was ideal physical beauty.
Photographs of the prlllclpal stat-
ues by Praxltlles greatly aided in
giving an appreciative idea of tlie
sculptor and his work. Venus or
the Capitol. Hermes and the in-
tautDionysus,ApolloSauroctonos
and The Marble Faun ivere among
these.

Topics for extemporaneous
work were assigned as follows:
Peace Commissioners. A. Risser;
Condition in the Philippines.
Quaile; Journalism as a Vocation,
Crosby. The question tor debate
wangesolved: That a formal al-
liance between the U. S, and Great
Britain for the advancement of
common interest is advisable. Afr
ﬁrmative. Blodgett; Negative,
Heald. The afﬁrmative declared
that since this is an age of trusts
and combination. an alliance be-
tween nations of common ances-
try and tendencies, could be easily
realized.

The reeling ot kinship between
the two nations was testiﬁed to by
the fact that in l897 there was
no dissenting voice in England
against such an alliance, Alliance
tends to impose peace. which is
needed by both nations.

The negative held that to be ad

visable the alliance must be bent:-
Flcial. not only for tlletwo nations.
but tor the world. Washington's
advice against European alliances
was forcibly called to mind. The
negative maintained that the dif-
ierent tendencies oi the two nae
tions would not warrant such an
alliance, The chair decided in
favor of the afﬁrmative,

The Greek Play.

The work on the lunioi play
which is to be given next week.
has been rapidly progressing and
now that permission has been ob
tained to use the Rand Gynlnar
sium there seems to be nothing to
hinder “The Return ot Odysseus“
rrom being by tar the most siice
cesstiil cieek play that has ever
been given by students of our in
stitntion.

The play will consist of six acts.
the ﬁrst of which shows the home
or Odysseus where are gathered
the haughty princesisuitors for
Penelope. and where Atheiie ap»
pears to encouiage Telemaciius.

In the second act Odysseus 3p
in one of the adventures
he meets with in his ten

peat-s
which
years' wandering. in hei palace
sits Circe the eneliantress, and be-
fore her stands Odysseus. who re.
fuses to be tempted by the many
pleasures which she otters.

The third act brings upon the
scene the princess Naiisicaa. who
is playing ball with her maidens.
while the ncxt act shous Odysseus
again. who makes siipplication lor
protection and hospitality from
King Alciiioiis.

The excitement at the play is
centered in the ﬁlth act. where the
nobles of Alctnoi‘ls' court meet in
trials of sticngth. They box. tries-
tle. hurl tlle dlsctls. Icap and dance,
amid the cheers and applause or a
goodly nuinbei of spectators.
.The last act is the most drar
ntatic and at the same time the
truest and most human all all. It
pictures the return of Odysseus to
his own home. the joy or his wire
Penelope and the discoinhture of
the suitors.

The Delpliic hymn to Apollo
which is given as a prelude. and
the other Greek stiatns which are
heard at different times through-
out the play add a charm to the
play which is indesciihablc.
