THE FIRST presentation of “The
Return or Odysseus." which ucr
curred last evening. showed that
the Junior clsss had not misdir
rected their energies in the pro
duction of an annual, but proved
that something out of tlte llne’oi
the customary annuals and Cole
lege plays could be tavorably res
ceivcd by the students and town
triends. This play has becn a
laborious undertaking tor the
Juniors, and if all of the class
had not entered into it with a
feeling that they were in part re-
sponsible tor the success or the
play. it would have been n piti-
able failure, As it was, “The Rec
turn or Odysseus“ was, without
doubt. the superior in point of
beauty and picturesqueness of
any play which the students at
’Grinnell have ever given.

Each member responded toioll-
call by naming an artist ofthe 15th
centttly. alIer wlttcll Miss Eva
hitch, in it well prepared paper,
gave a brief account of the ltie oi
Titian. who was born at Cadol'c,
in 1:477. in a land or picturesque
scenery whose inﬂuence may be
traced in many or his works. His
unequalled power as a colorist
made ltim the best portrait painlet
of his time, and he stood at the
head of the school of Venice, as
a typical representative at its
strength and its weakness. “The
Christ of the Tribute Money,"
which has been pronounced his
most polished work, is now one at
the choice masterpieces of the
Dresden gallery.

Atrer a pleasing reading by
Miss Ella Meltlin. the society was
very highly entertained by a solo
by Mr. Risser.

Miss Gertrude sivnney gave a
very entertaining and instructive
talk on Correggio, presenting picks
ures ot many of his works of nit.
Correggio cannot be put with any
Italian school, but is the result of
all the strong talent of his time
He is the greatest master of light
and dark, and developed this
method as El means to representa-
tion or sudden expression rind,
rupid movements ol riiee ilnd ges-‘
tul'e, In all his subjects there is

life and motion. He loved In der
