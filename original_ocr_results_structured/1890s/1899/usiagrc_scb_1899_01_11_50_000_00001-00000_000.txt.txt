Mrs. Kelly’s Lectures.

Tile two lectures which were dew
livcrcd in Grlnncll by Mrs Flora
tincc Kelly, of Hull house, Chica
go, on the sulricct of "Child Lt ‘
bor," were highly instructive and
inter ling to all who lleaitl them.
hll's. Kelly, by virtue of her ex
pcriciicc as factory inspector
Illinois, and llCr more recent life
in Hull house, is well qualiﬁed to
speak on the themes ultich she

Two objtctrtiris are raised to
this couisc- ,‘ihat some fumlllcsl
would be lt‘ll utterly destitute if

the children untlcr

 

sixteen were

discharged, and that the majority
oi the children thus employed are
proﬁted by rhc experience, while
only a low rail and are [mind to

‘bc dishonest.

Both tltcsc objections have been
successfully met by one cailton iii
Suit' rland. Here all children
hour the ages or tlliec to sixteen
are obliged to atlend school dur-
ing the whole school year, The
authorities of the canton pay a
scholarship [or all those children
in school whose families arc ill

This idea s crus an Utopian ouc.

his. Kelly's subject Monday
evening was “Labor chlslatlon.”
She said in part; "Chicago is in
a turmoil continually. Crimes ale
more numerous in 111' ois than in
to the
many tiitteront classes or people
and tho pecuhar development of
legislation Iilcn now it is int-
possiblu to obtain legislation to
protect litlioiers.

in 1893 the legislature passed
a law prohibiting the employ
merit of WOVnCll and children [or
longer than eight hours a day, but
this was annulled by the supreme
court, Later, the legislature
brought forward a bill that cone
tracts corrld not be interfered nith,
and this the supreme court ap—
proved.

An attempt lvas made to pass
abill fruhtdtling minors to work
longer than eight hornsa day, but
the newspapers, glass ttoiirs and
factories combined and caused its
defeat. At the present time it is
impossible to legislate in regard
to the labor liotirs of anyone over
eighteen yours or agc,

In Utah popular vote and the
legislature passed a law to restrict

the time of miners and smelters to
eight hours, and this was upheld
by the supreme court. This is
the only place in the country
where the hours [or labor are re-
stricted by law.

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY ll,

Laborers in Illinois have tried
to organize, |:tit sever at times their
gatherings have been broken tip
by militia. The employees of the
elevated roads oi Chicago are io.
quired to sign a contract not to
organize.

This state or arraii-s can only bc
changed when the decision of the
supreme court is brought into liar-
nrony with the SuprL‘mc corirt iii

Saturday cvciiing marked the
beginning ota new era in Clues-
