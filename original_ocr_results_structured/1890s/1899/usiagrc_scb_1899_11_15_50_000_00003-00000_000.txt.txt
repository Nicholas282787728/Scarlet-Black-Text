The society is in excellent working con.
dition, having a membership of thirty
two active members, all of whom are
there for literary work. For the last two
or three years the society has been some-
what small, but we now have enough to
make Work lively and proﬁtable. The
ﬁrst number on the program was “News
items" by Carney. Mr, Carney gave the
society some iresh and spicy irems. Fol-
lowing this Miichel read a humorous sc-
lcciion, which was the cause of some
laughter among the boys. The next
number was a poem by Knapp, which
was very good; and Mcllrath then [ole
lowed with an address on the subject
“How to improve our Debale," which
was decidedly good. The president then
called Eorexrempomneous work from Mo
Hard. Bernard and Gonzales, who re.
sponded with interesting lalks. The der
hate was then taken up and handled with
considerable skill and energy, The quesr
iion was. “Resolved: Thar women ol the
United States should be allowed to vole."
The arrirmauve was supported by Osiling

and Peirce; the negative by Gonzales
and Quaitc. The decision was in invor
of tire negative.
