Grinnell, Sntlll'lllly why 20. 15 ;

Qﬁhitoriul

THE FATES presiding over the
weather seem to think Grinnell a
most favorable spot on which to
vent their spite, Nearly cvcry
Saturday this spring ruin has pre-
vented some athletic event set (or
that date, and to-day it proved es-
pecially detrimental to baseball
and tennis interests. Teams from
Cornell. Penn and the State Uni-
versity have been in Grinnell since
Friday morning. walling tor a
chance totry their skill on the ten-
riis courts, but they have ﬁnally
been compelled to postpone the
tournament until Monday.

WITH THE state meet less than
a week off, it seems that it is high
time that the students were tak
ing active means toward securing
a large delegation to represent
Grinnell on that day, and to en-
courage hcrathletcs It is every-
where admitted that this will be
the closest and most hotly cotlr
tested meet in the history ul lowa
Athletics and it is probable that
three schools will be within ten
points of each other at tho close
of the meet. Drake of course,
will be present with her whole
student body and her many Des
Moines Sympalhllersl The State
Normal will send a brass band of
forty pieces and it is reported
that nearly a thousand students
are planning to go. S. U. l. and
Ames will both be represented by
large bodies of students. It will
be easily seen that it Grinnell is
to make licrsclt vcry plainly cvir
dent in the grand stand, no small
number of students will be able
to do it, The Rock Island road
as usual, will offer reduced rates,
tickets good to rcturn probably

as late as Saturday night. It is
to be hoped that shat some syste-
matic means will be taken at once
toward securing a crowd and at
tending to the yelling on the
grounds. Grinnell has never
shown her lack of enthusiasm on
such occasions, even when her
team was on the losing side, and
this must be no exception, for, it
ever, at this meet her athletes
will need support from the grand
stand.

S. U lerebraska Meet.

The dual meet between the stale
univerSlties or lowaand Nebraslta,
which took place yesterday at
Iowa City, resulted in a tie be
tween the two teams; each side
winning six ﬁrsts Wilson ran an
excellent mile in the time 0(4145,
which is a triﬂe better than the
state record. Louis broke the
state iccord iii the high jump,
clearing the bar at git 9% inches.
