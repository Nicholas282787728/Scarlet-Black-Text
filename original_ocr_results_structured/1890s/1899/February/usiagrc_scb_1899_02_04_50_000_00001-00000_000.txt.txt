Grrrrnell people have looked
forward with interest and pleasure
to the ﬁrst appearance of Miss
Rew before a Grinnell audience
since her return ltom Euiope.
and they rvere not disappointed,
Miss Rew was at her best in the
Allegro energlco or ﬁrm/rt Violin
Concerto.

Professor Emery was in excel-
lent voice and gratiﬁed his outli-
ence both iii tlle matter and man-
ner of his selections. His rendi-
tions of Illarlz'ui’r Plaisil‘ d'amour
and Rzu’ Arise! [or the world rec
joices, were particularly pleasing.

Miss l-lill played [or the ﬁrst
time before a Grinnell audience,
making a ﬁne impression. She
periornied the pranissrmo pass
sages with especial deircacy and
taste. As an encore she gave
Sc/tubtirl's Menuetto in 8 minor.

The performers labor-ed under
difﬁculties because of the cold,

The program Friday atternoon
was an exceptionally enjoyable
one. especially the musical por-
tion. A song. “Marguerita,” by
Mrs. Heidel, was the ﬁrst number,
no praise of which is needed for
all those who have heard Mrs.
Heidel sing.

Miss Katherine Henderson read
a paper, “A Colonial Dame.”
which was in the form of a selec-
tion from a colonial girl's diary,
telling of her life and ambitions.
Miss Henderson was dressed to
portray the girl whom she reprer
sented. and her charming costume
added much to a very enjoyable
reading.

"A Daughter or the Revolur
tion," by Helen Leach, told of the
patriotism of the women of the
revolution and the sacriﬁce they
practiced tor the success ot’ the
A sketch was given or the
modern society "Daughters ot the
Revolution," telling of their work
in preserving historic places and
relics of the colonial titnes.

As a contrast to the girl of the
eighteenth century, Miss Kyle
spoke of “The Girl of Today."
Liberty-lovrng America was the
ﬁrst to advance the position or
women and in this is lar ahead of
other countries. "The grace that
comes lrom strength is far more
than the grace that
comes from ignorance.” Miss
Kyle's paper was exceptionally
ﬁne, perhaps the best of the after-
noon.

The extemporaneous work was
given by Misses Emma Stuart,
Lott Richards and May Parker.

As a whole the talks were up to
the average, but not so good as
we hope to hear in the society.

Miss Williams played a piano
solo which was very mrrch ens
joyed. The society hopes to hear
Miss Williams again soon.

The last thing on the program
was aseries of three tableaux, por-

Miss Slocum of the School of
Music favored the society with a
piano solo, atter which Miss

spoke at the tendency of the in-
dividual and the race to veei, now
towards one and now towards all-
other of many phases oi thought
and production. The tendency
of the writers of thelast ten years
has been to rcvtve the romantic
phase. especially in the drama,
As With everything else there is a
rhythm in the occurence at are
ttsttc schools, but the recurrence
is never in the some torm.

Romanticism at today is not
like romanticism of other periods
It is purer. more wholesome. The
movement is not the imitation by
the many ol the eccenrrrertres oi

dependent development in Wt'|[~
