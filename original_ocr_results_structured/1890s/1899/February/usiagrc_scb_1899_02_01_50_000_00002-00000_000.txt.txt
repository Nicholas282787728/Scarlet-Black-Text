A LATE issue of The Come/[inn
in an editorial urges the students
to fresh exertions in track athlet-
ics, in order that they may not
lose “their enViabIe place in the
association," but may win the nine
points at the coming State Field
Meet which are necessary it they
are to remain in the association.
No one can accuse our Methodist

, brethren of UVS|~COnﬁd€ﬂCC. We
would suggest that they go to
work to win the meet, and secure
the nine points incidentally.

IN leilzR columns of this issue.
will be found a statement from the
Chrestomathian SoCicty and the
Grinnell Institute of the relucts
ance with which they gave up their
meetings on next Saturday evene
ing in order that the Junior class
might entertain the Freshmen in
the society halls. Under ordinaiy
circumstances we do not approve
of such a policy on the part of the
societies, but in this case their ac-
tion seems allowable. We would
suggest, however, in order to
avoid such complications in the
future,that the time of the Faculty
concert be announced more deﬁe
nitely than it has been heretofore.
The Junioi-class had issued invita-
tions and made preparations tor
Friday evening, believing it to be
an open date, and it was only when
they applied for permission hour
the faculty that they found that
the concert was to occur the same
night, The same thing has so
curred in other years. It would
not be at all difﬁcult to announce
the date of the conceit a few weeks
beforehand, and thus avoid like
misunderstandings and difﬁculties
in the future,
