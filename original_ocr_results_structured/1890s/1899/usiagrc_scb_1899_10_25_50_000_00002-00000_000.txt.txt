SCARLET AND BLACK takes pleas~
ure in welcoming to the staff the new
editors whose names appear for the
ﬁrst time in this issue. It has been
the pin pose of the present board of
editors to make the most careful
choice possible from the material at
hand, and they feel certain that the
aim has been accomplished. All of
those whose names now appear have
already done work on the paper and
proved their capability to hold the
places which they occupy, and we
feel certain that all departments of
SCARLET AND BLACK are in good
hands.

LAsT YEAR there was considerable
complaint from the students that the
exchange table was not taken care of;
and that no late papers were ever
there. Rememberingthese complaints,
the management has arranged that
one member of the board should keep
this table iii order and place exchanges
there as soon as they came. In re-
turn tor this courtesy, there are stu-
dents who persist iii taking these ex-
changes away from thereading room.
This not only prevents other students
from using these, but also prevents the
exchange editor from looking up any
items of interest. The natural result
of this attempt to make a “circulating
library” out of the exchange table,
will be the discontinuance of the tar
ble, unless the exchanges are left on
it. ‘There should be no more of this
”stealing.” The papers are placed
in the reading room through the cour~
tesy oi SCARLET AND BLACK and at
some trouble and inconvenience.
this is so little appreciated that every-
one must help himself toa paper, the
table had better be abolished.

made by the members of the Des
Moines Association for the entertain-
ment of delegates, except for the noon-
day lunch. ,Delegates must provide
for this themselves. The names of
those who desire entertainment must
be sent to Mrs. George Royal, care of
the Y. W. C. A., Des Moines, Iowa,

tical subjects as these will be discussed:
“Bible Circles," “Association Clubs,"
“Suburban Branches,” “inﬂuence of
the Y. W. C. A. in College Life," “The
College Woman’s Relation to the State
and City Work,” “Domestic Science,"
“Financial Problem,” “The Study of
Missions,” “Individual Responsibility
of Members.” We are to have lead
ers and speakers from among those
who are actively engaged in the work,
and who can speak from the stand
point of a worker. Our own state
workers, general secretaries, physical
directors, state committee and board
members, besides leaders of Bible
bands are to be with us. From out of
the state are Miss Harriet Taylor, gen-
eral secretary, and Miss Bertha Conde,
