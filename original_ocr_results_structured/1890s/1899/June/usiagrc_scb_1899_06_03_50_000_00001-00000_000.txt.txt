class will give a representation of
Shakespeare's “As You Like It.”
This play is given as the iegular
class day exercise of the graduate
ing class. It was thought that the
old fashioned program or set
speeches by people who as a rule
would have nothing to say, were
not this artiﬁcal occasmn (illcletl

the class turned to the drama,
this being before it harl been made
public that the junior class intends
ed to give tiren Greel: play. it it;
perhaps a trifle unfortunate that
two dramatic effmts should come
so close together, but when it is
borne in mind that the Greek
play was more a series oi tableaux
representing Greek life than an
effort-directed specially at the
drama, though there was much
excellent characterization in the
representation, the intelicity drsr
appears, Forthepresentattempt
of the Senior class is. oi course,
distinctively an effort at dramatic
interpretation "As You Like It”
is one ot the simplest ot plays
from the point of View oi stage
setting. The whole action of the
play takes place out oi doors, in
the gardens of Olivel's house or
in the forests of Alden. Men
and women drawn with all the
charm and power ot the world's
greatest dramatist must itirnisli
the interest. The class has made
stupendous efforts to make this
representation of “As You Like
It” a worthy one. It is believed
that its production will be a great
contribution to the college life,
Miss Smith has trained the actors.
She has worked conscientiously
and raithiully. She hasexcellcnt
insight into the subtilties of situs
atiou and character, and has thus
tar wrought almost undreamed re»
stilts upon her material. The cast
of characters is as follows:

Tire play has, of course, been
cut some. It is much too long for
the patience ofa modern audience.
Miss Smith has been especially
successful in this; otily ﬁve ot the
shorter and less important scenes
were cut out entire; for the rest,
individual speeches and parts oi
speeches were Omittetl, This is
an exiremely important detail, for
it is frequently complained that
the actors so mutilate the plays
that they are hardly recognizable
as Slraieespear 's. Not a word or
the text remaining has been ale
teretl, Costumes have been ore

Of course it rs too early to speal:
of the acting, The writer has been
privileged to sec almost the whole
play in rehearsal, and it seems
safe to say that the acting of
the cast is entirely on a par with
the very best amateur acting. The
whole action depends so closely in
every nrrnutc detarl upon the trvo
main roles of Rosalind and Orr
lando, that it is extremely gratify
mg to be able to say that these two
parts are ably interpreted. Espcs
cially can this be said of Miss
Knox's presentation of Rosalind.

The melancholy
lacqucs with his pompous Caprice
isnis and touching moralitics will
reach that decpei vein of humor
which isrcally pathos that lies in
all of us. Brit undoubtedly the
ﬁnest acting developed thus far
is in the part of Corin, the old
shepherd; he is irresistable.
Among tlrc other characters per-
liap:r the most successfully inter-
preted are those of Adam, the
iaithiul old servant, and Duke
Fmrlericlcthe usiirper. Of course
the Senior players do not expect
to give a representation of “As
You Lilre It" that will stand the
stein criticism oi the professional
ciitic. But that it will be a
worthy perrormance of the play,
the present writer does not host
tale in the least to say with all
possible emphasis. No one can
bchrild these men and
live-tint llteil‘ lives of rich, deep
passion, portrayed as they are
with all the inimitable humor and
pathos ot Shakespeare's rnastcr-
hand,and not be deeply moved
toward better and nobler thing.
The Senior class is to be highly
praised tor their eHoi't to bring
to the college life and the broad-
cr Circle of (rlends and townsinen
so rich a contribution as a faitlir
inland conscientious per-rorrnance
of Slialicspeare’s “As You Like
It” rnrrst necessarily be. it is
hoped that students and friends
will spread this notice of the play
in every convenient way, The
play will be given in Rand Gym-
nasium. No charge for admit-
tance will be made, or at most a
very small charge sufﬁcient only
to pay off the heaviest expenses.
It is not the Custom to charge for
class day exercises, and the pres-
ent Senior class does not wish to
break so excellent a precedent,
But class day hitherto has not
ordinarily involved much expense
nor so much labor on the part of
so many members of the class.
The rnantei oration by Miss Hunt
will be given as a prologue to the
play so that no time honored cuss
tom of the institution will be vice
latcd.
