Tllls HAS been essentially a dra»
matic year in iowa college. The
reign of fal'ceecomcdy began early
in tlle (all and continued through-
out the year, and the classics were
ably represented by the “Return
of Odysseus” in the spring. The
step which the class of ’99 has
taken in presenting “AsYou Like
It.” instead ot the usual class day
program of orations, may well be
regarded as a ﬁtting termination
of the year, The range of dra»
matic interpretation has been
large, and it is only right that the
immortal Shakespeare should
have recognition. “As You Like
It" is abeautiiul play and the sen
iors have made wise choice in deV
ciding to produce it. It will also
be a welcome change trom the
sameness which class day exercis»
es so often have, although it can
hardly be said that this action of
’99 should serve as a precedent
for all the classesthat are tocome.
From all indications the play will
be successful, at least it any judg~
ment can be formed from the
amount of work put upon it, and
its production on next Friday
evening will be awaited with great
interest by the students.

Ellis.

on Friday atternoon occurred
the graduating exercises of the
Ellis Society, at which time two
of the members received their di»
plomas. Miss Fanny Buchanan
opened the meeting with a piano
solo, which was very well rendered
but she tailed to respond with an
encore, This was followed with
the roll call. The members of
the society were very much
pleased to have with them at the
meeting, Mrs. Gates, who talked
to them tor a tew minrrtes and pre»
sented the diplomas. The main
theme of Mrs. Gates‘ talk was tlle
need oi leadership. to meet the
dimcultand most perplexing prob
lems of the world. One reason
given tor the great lack of efﬁcient
leaders at the present day. is on
'account or the rcsponsibilrty at—
tached to all important undertak-
ings. To be a good leader the
sympathies must be broad and
deep. and the capacity tor seeing
misery anti injustice in the world
must be cultivated. All the best
men and women ill the world have
done this. They have gone trom
homes never touched by the world
and yet they have done so much

Lady Buchler, of England, Fran—
ces E. Willard. whose power will
always be ielt tor the work she has
done. and again Lady Aberdeen.

So we must recognize the necessir
ty of touching the lives oi men
and women if we would lead them
and no one should be more capa-
ble of doing this than the college-
bred woman. Mrs, Gates then
presented the diplomas to Miss
Gertrude Swaney and Miss Mary
Tate. and Miss Lulu Williams
closed the program with a piano
solo.

Atter the program a social hour
was indulged in, during which
trappe was served by the two sent
iors. Theclosing meeting oi Ellis
tor the year, was in every way
most pleasant. as indeed has been
the work tor the entire year.

all technical difﬁculties, and a re7
