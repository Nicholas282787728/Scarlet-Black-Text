THE MYSTERIOUS disappearance
ot Wayne Bagley is still unex-
plalned. and seems likely to tea
main so. During his short stay
in Grinnell, Mr. Bagley had prove
ed himselfa faithful and diligent
studentand a young man of ﬁne
character, and we cannot butbe-
‘lieve that some harm has befallen
him. SCARLET AND BLACK wishes
to express thesympathy of all the
students of the college toward
Mr. Bagley's parents and friends,

VVDRK ON Ward Field fence ls
not making very rapid strides to
ward completion, and the mem-
bers of the different classes do not
show any marked enthusiasm
when their turn comes to take a
hand. The trustees have been
very generous in giving us the
land to enlarge the ﬁeld, as have
the altinini in the donation of the
materials (oi the fence. It would
seem that the least we could do is
to perform our part as students
and ﬁnish the building. Already
considerable progress has been
made, and it needs only a little
more persistence to see the work
accomplished. The fence is ours.
and it is to our own interest to see
it ﬁnished, and with as little delay
as possible. It the classes do their
part, only a few more afternoons
willbe necessary, and it is to be
hoped that the students will take
enough interest to bring the work
to completion.

BY LAST Saturday’s game, the
iootball team demonstrated to all
unbelievers tllat they could play
football and play it well, and the

enthusiasts of the far North, who
were hinting at a score of 30 to o
in their favor and making prepar-
ations for a war dance after the
victory, were compelled to defer
their celebration until a later date.
It is no small feat to hold to a tie
a team representing an institution
some three tlmes larger than we,
and we can justly congratulate
ourselves over this result, and
honor the team which accomplish-
ed it. However, it ,must be re-
membered that the most impor-
tant games of the season, and
those which we are most anxious
to win, are yet before us. If we
do succeed in running over Ames
and S. U I. it will not be until
alter we have relized that there was
some obstacle in the way, and
there is need of a long pull and a
strong pullon the part of every-
body it the desired result is to be
relized. SCARLETAND BLACK would
like to sees more united college
spirit than has been evident this
fall. Class 513' 't is all right. and
we do not wish to say any-thing
against it, but college spirit comes
ﬁrst, and we have not much to
to spare. One cannot help think-
ing that it the muscular activity
which has been evidentamong the
classes during the last few days,
had been manifested on the
gridiron, we would have a better
team this tall. Let everyone
turn in and do his best to support
the team and to bring the cham-
plonship to Grinnell another year.
