Grlnnell Institute.

The adverse criticism which
has been bestowed on the last two
meetings at Grinnell institute
seemed to bear fruit on Wednes-
day evening, for a higher degree
of preparation and a greater in»
terest in the subject presented
than has been usual so far this
year was shown by every member
on the ﬂoor. The attendance was
increased by a number of visitors.
who are always welcome to the
meetings of the society.

The program was opened by a
reading by Gleysteen, ivliich
proved to be an interesting ac-
count of the preparation ot a
play tor the stage. The reader
made a good impression in his
ﬁrst appearance on an Institute

program.

Ziegler delivered a speech on
“Our Policy in the Paciﬁc." He
was at ease on the ﬂoor and set
forth his ideas clearly.

Harris read one of the most in-
structive papers of the year, on
the subject of “Wireless Tele-
graphy.” Careful preparation was
evident throughout, and the sub
ject was one which interested not
only the speaker, but also his
audience

A talk on “The French Judie
cial System" ivas then given by
Blatherwick. Mr. Blatherwick
showed a knowledge of his sub-
ject worthy of imitation by the
rest of the society, as he spoke
entirely without notes. at the

same time manifesting a thorn
ough study of details,

Two exteniporaneous numbers
were given. Dickinson speaking
on the “Pan-American Exposir
tion" and H. G. Lyman on the
"Alaskan Boundary."

Mrs. Whitcomb followed
a pleasing vocal solo and
sponded to a hearty encore.

The question for debate was
"Resolved: That Roberts of
Utah,Should be Refused aSeat
in Congress.” and was supported
on the afﬁrmative by Nollen and
on the negative by Spaulding.
Both speakers were well pre
pared. but the great interest in
the debate centered in the part
taken by the volunteers The
spiritot debate seemed aroused
for the ﬁrst time, and several
members took advantage otthe

with
re-

 

opportunity given to speak on
different sides til the question.
After the critic’s report. by
Engeike, the debate was decided
in favor of the negative.

Chresto-Ellis Meeting.

The joint meeting ot the Chi-es
to and Ellis societies, which was
held In Clllesto Hall last evening.

onesin point of attendance and
