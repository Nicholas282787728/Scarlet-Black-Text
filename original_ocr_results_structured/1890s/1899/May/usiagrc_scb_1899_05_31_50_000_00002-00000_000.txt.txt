THERE SEEMS to be considerable
uncertainty even yet as to wheth-
er a team will represent Griuncll
at the meet of the W. I C. A. A
A., at Chicago. next Saturday. It
seems, however, that there should
be no hesitation on this matter,
Grinnell has men who would rep
resent her with ciedit at this meet.
Moreover, it we me not represent
ed this year, we will hc dropped
from the association, an occur—
rence which no alumnus or friend
of Grinnell would countenance,
It is,without doubt, the sentiment
ofall the students that Iowa Cole
[age have a team at the meet next
Saturday.

Mr. Woods’ Chapel Talk.

on sunday attcrnoon, Mr. Ros
bert A. Woods of Andover House,
Boston, villa gave the Rand lec»
tures in applied christianity thiee
years ago, addressed the students
on the theme of association as the
solvent of present day social prob-
lems. The speaker led up to his
theme by showing that the only
way to get a true understanding
of any social problem is to view it
through the eyes of all those per-
sons or classes who are involved
in it. In other words the student
must be sympathetic as well as
scientiﬁc. Moreover, the social
reformer must have a taith which
insists on the highest that he can
conceive for any individual, for
men will endeavor to be what
other men believe them to be.
This same hopehrl view must he
held also with respect to the corn.
munity anti society as a whole.
Love in its social aspect manifests
itselfin association. And it is not
only because men realize that
there is gieater gain to themselves
in association, but because of a
deep, not wholly analyzable hu-
man impulse, and a consciousness
that so each man is helping evcty
other to come tip higher. The
age is one of association rather
than of invention as it is so often
called because there would be no
pos bility or purpose ot inven-
tion without association.
