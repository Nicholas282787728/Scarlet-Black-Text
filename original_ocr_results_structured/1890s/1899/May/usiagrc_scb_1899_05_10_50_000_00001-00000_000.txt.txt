event‘s were over and Grinnell was
twenty points in the lead, not a
sound canlc {tool the wearers of
the old gold, but when the half
mile run, hamllicr throw and walk
scored eight points apiece for

I'Iutt’lteycs. -

The ,50ryard dash as usual

The haltrmile run was the most
hotlylcontestcd event of the after

Ames vs. Grinnell.

The opening game oi the lowa
Intercollegiate League was all that
could be hoped for, looking at it
iron. the standpoint ol Grinnell.
Fear had been expressed that by
reason of the easy games played
this season, Grinnell would put up
a loose game against the agricul.
tuiists, btit this fear was soon disr
polled by thegicat individual work
of the [can]. But tor an error by
Wheeler in the ﬁrst inning, and
a wild throw by Tait in the eighth,
Grinnell would have played an er»
rorless game. Onc lone hit was
all the visitor-s were able to make
off Captain Higgs, but starting
with the ﬁrst inning Grinnell kept
up a terriﬁc bombardment, ﬁnding
Smith for sixteen singles and two
two-base hits. Eachtman on the
Grinncll team deserves a share of
the credit for the whining of the
game. There was not milcli star
work, but the men wearing the
scarlet and black put up good,
steady ball at every stage of the
game.

The score by innings is as fol-
laws:

In the ﬁrst Shea. torArnes, gets
to ﬁrst on Wheeler’s error. Hooks
er lets Higgs tllrow three times, all
of which the umpire calls strikes.
Malcom is thrown out at ﬁrst, and
Smith fans. For Grinnell each
man was given a bat, witll a result
of three hits and four scores.
