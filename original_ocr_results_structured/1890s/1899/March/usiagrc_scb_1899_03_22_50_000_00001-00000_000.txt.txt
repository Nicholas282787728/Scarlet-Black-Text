The Institute Banquet.

The members of the Grinnell
Institute celebrated the near ap-
proach of the spring Vacation last
Saturday evening by entertaining
themselves and friends at a ban
quet, given in honor of the Grins
ncll debaters at the Mack hotel.

At about nine o‘clock the guests
began to assemble in numbers
which it would be well if the In»
strtute could imitate at some of its
regular meetings. and aftera short
social time spent in the hotel par-
lors. adjourned tothcdining riium,
where an appetizrng repast was
served.

Immediately following this, the
program of the evening was taken
up. One thought seemed to ani
mate all the speakers, namely,
that the time for the reawakening
of the debating interests in Iowa
College had come and that the old
attitude of indirtcrciicc and'caro
lessness had passed away.

The program was opened by a
wellsrendei'ed banjo and guitar
duet by Messrs. Thompson and
Eldridge, following which, Presi-
dent Davis, astoastsmaster made
a few remarks calling attention to
the changed order of things, and
then called on Mr, Dennison, who
spoke of the reforms which were
being contemplated in the system
of choosing debaters and arrangr
ing for preliminary debates.

Mr, Lindsay, in answering to
the toast on Debaters expressed
the appreciation which the stu-
dents felt tor the strong showing
which the debaters had made. Mr.
Roberts, in responding. spoke of

the need of enthusiasm in debat-
ing and also expressed the thanks
of the debaters to Professor Macy
for the aid he had rendered them.

Professor Macy was then called
on, and spoke brieﬂy. calling at-
tention to the intcrcst which the
debate with Corncll had aroused
throughout the college, following
which Messrs. Thompson and El»
dridgo rendered a second duct,

The toast on Debaters was re-
sponded to by Mr- Campbell, who
gave a brief sketch of the history
of debating in Iowa College and
predicted good things for the (tie
ture. Mr. R. D, Douglass res
sponded in behalf of the debaters,
in a few well-chosen words.

Mr. Macartney gave the last
toast of the evening. on Banquets,
expressing the hope that these
banquets might be made an annur
al occurrence. Mr, Parish ien~
dated a vocal solo in a picasing
manner, and the meeting was ad
journed by the singing of the
"Scarlet and Black "

The banquet was a success in
every way. and it is to he hoped
that it may be made a permanent
custorii. It certainly did not tail
in its purpose of rousing interest,
as any one listening to the speech-
es could not doubt that the Re
naissance of literary work in Iowa
College was at hand.

ccssful production of the Greek

ing their parts, and rchcarsals will

be portrayed the old Greek dances
and the customs of cvcryrday life,
into winch Homer gives so clear
an insight.

While all the dialogue will be
in Greek the action is i'cniarkably
simple, two scenes being actcd
without the speaking of a word,
and whatever drmcrilty in under
standing might arise will be obv'
atod by synopses in English, giv»
on before each act.

Anothcr feature of the play will
be the music, which has been de-
signed expressly for it, One com-
