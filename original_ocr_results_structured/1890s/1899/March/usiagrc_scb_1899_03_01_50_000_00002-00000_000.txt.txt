Chrestomathian,

The program Saturday evening
was well up tn Chiestornathizin
standard. Most of the members
were in their places and the result
was a very lively and interesting
meeting.

Vetiii opened the program with
a wellewritlcn paper on the Scan-
dinavian system ot handling the
Liquor Question. It showed care-
tul preparation and a thorough
understanding or the subject.

The society was then favored
with a piano solo by Miss Proctor,
who was warmly encored, but did
not respond. Miss l’i'oclrir is al»
ways a favorite ivith the society.
Mallet followed will] a short story
by Ellis l’ailcer Butler, entitled
“The Reformation ol Uncle Bill.”
It ii its a humorous story. and just
the liiiitl the society needs occa-
sionally. Mr. Moller rendered it
in a vory pleasing manner and
kept his bearing reltlrtrltdbly neli

his paper was appreciated very
much.

The extemporaneous work was
up to the usual standard. Hamlin
spoke three minutes on his recent

impressions of the city. Leonard
spoke at Dr. Herron and his work.
giving a veryinipartial thoughjust
view of both sides of the question.

Meade closed the extempora-
neous work with a talk on his im»
pressions of Mr, Martin who gave
the Rand Lecture Course. Evi-
dently Mr. Meade received a
great deal ot good from the lee—
tures.

The debate was, “Resolved. That
Canada Should be Annexed to the
United States," Thiel supported
the aﬁiirnlative while Cruikshank
denied. Bothsupportedtheir'side
of the question well, but Thiel in
his rebuttal rather got the better
of his opponent and the decision
was given in tavor oi the aﬂirrna-
live.

In the business meeting a great
deal of fun was indulged in, and
on the whole the session was one
of the most pleasant of the year.
