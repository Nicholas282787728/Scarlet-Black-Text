Mr. .l. s. Wilson. .

tConlimrcd [mm First Pogo) ‘
Mr. Wilson is a man wllo, although
sometimes carried by the zeal oi hrs
cans: a little beyond the limits of they
strictest impartiality, llevelthclassl
comes to us With the plain, vital, sari-l
ous message of one who has livcd tlio'
things \vhereot he speaks, whose con-
tact lvith hrlmanity has divested him
of all the cheapncss of conscious cler-
ical mannerism, and who feels so pro-
toundly the vast meaning of life, that
his interpretation of it cannot but stir
the minds of those who hear him to a1
more scrious thoughtfulness along the
lines on which he speaks.

Tennis Tournament.

' Saturday afternoon a tennis tournr
ament was held with S. U. 1. upon
the home courts. The weathcr was
somewhat inclement, but all the
matches were pulled oﬁ successfully.
Engclke and Halsey played for Grins
nell, while Shaw and Bailey icpl‘er
sentcd Iowa City.

in the doubles the State University
men played well together and won in
straight sets, 6-2, 775, although it re-
quired good tennis to win the last.

Engelkc won his match of sing‘lcs
with Shaw, 876, 6-4, after a pretty
exhibition on both sides, but Halsey
lost to Bailey, 36, 6-4, 26, taking
the second set by excellent net work,
but weakening on the last.

MusiCrLtterary.

The ﬁrst meeting of the Music-Lit-
erary Society was held in the conserw
atory Monday evening. The attends
ance tor the ﬁrst meeting was good,
and the society anticipates a very 5H5,
ccssful year.

A paperon the“Benetits of the Study
of Music” was given by Martha Parr
ker, in which she clearly and forcibly
showed the value of lnusic study as a
means for developing and broadening
the mind.

Mr. Cole then gave a short talk on
the value of society work and urged

 

the students to makc use of the recent
gift of hooks to the library which
makes lt one of the best in the wcst.

The only rnrrsrcal number on the
progr am was rendered by Md)’ Ward

lll her usual charming manucl.

Scrubs VS, High School.

On Saturday attcrnooll the second
team lined up against the high school
for a practice game. The college
men out-ucighcd the l'cprcscntativcs
ot' the high school, and scored almost
at will, being held for downs brrt orlcc
during the game. The high school,
on the other halld, were weakened by
the absence of several rcgulal playcrs,
and wore unable to make any mar
tcrial gains. The work of the scrubs
was good, both on otlcns e and dc-
l'cnsivc. For three succc ve touch
downs they took tllc brill down thc

ﬁeld wrthout losing it once. The
ﬁlial score was 28 to O,
The scrubs lined up as follows:
