W1: NOTICED a statement in the
VidetlcRrpomr, taken from the
Nebraska Hispcn'alz. which calls
attention to the fact that a great-
er harmony than ever before is
now existing among the colleges
of Iowa. We are exceedingly
glad that such a state of affairs
exists. and exists to such an ex—
tent that the colleges of a neigh»
boring state can notice the fact,
It is certainly true that in the ma-
jority of cases the colleges ot the
state are on a better footing than
ever before, as has been shown by
numerous instances in connection
with the football games this (all.
It is also noticeable that the col-
lege athletics of the state as a
whole are cleaner than in past
years, and that a decided tide has
set in against anything which sa»
vors of professionalism. This is
a stateof affairs which we are glad
to welcome. No comparison be-
tween the college squabbles of
three or (our years ago and the
good feeling which exists at the
present time. is necessary to con-
Vince us as to which of the two is
more desirable. Experience has
shown that co-operation and hon-
est compctition are best tor‘ the
college world. We believe that
both of these conditions now ex-
ist, and sincerely hope for their

continuance.

THE GAME at Iowa City, for
which we have been husbanding

has become a matter othistory.
and we have discovered that our
aspirations in the direction of the

state championship partook large-
ly of the nature of castles in the
air. We have nothing but words
of the highest praise for Iowa's
eleven, There are no apologies
to offer for the defeat, and it
would be toolish to attempt to
manutactureany. Theuniversity
team won by one of the prettiest
exhibitions of teamwork which
has ever o'een displayed on an
Iowa gridiron. Neither do we
wish to detract from the good
worlt of our own team. No one
who saw the plucky and deter-

mined stand which the Grinllell'

men made againstthe heavy rush~
es of the Iowa players will deny
them the commendation which
they deserve. Even though vic—
tory has not perched on oul bans
ners, we are proud ot the team
which represented Grinnell. We
know that every \man played the
best game or which he was capa-
ble, and, although we were defeats
ed, still we are glad we can call it
an honorable detcat. Every fea
ture of the game was pleasant.
The play was begun on time. the
omcials were competentand there

was no wrangling, and the treat
ment which our delegation re
ceived from thecrowd was all that
could be desired We wish to
congratulate the champions of
Iowa for 1899, and to say that
since we were not able to win the
championship, we are glad that it
has gone where it has.
