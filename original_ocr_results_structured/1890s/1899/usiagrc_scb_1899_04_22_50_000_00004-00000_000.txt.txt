GrinnelHKnox Ball Game.

The ﬁrst game of the season on
the home grounds was played‘
this afternoon against Knox Colrl
legs of Galeshurg. Ill. Oil acr‘
count at disagteeablc weather
there was but a {air attelldatlcli.
but nevertheless an enthusiastic
one. The band played during tho
game which added greatly to ens
courage the players. Thegt'ollllds
were not in the best of condition
on account of the recent rains,
and which made the base running
somewhat slow. The game wus
hotly contested on both sides.

The features ot the gums were
the hits made by Higgs and tho
ﬁeld work oi Coggcshall. Taft
caught an sxcollont game. The
home work as a whole was very
good.

Grittnell began early in the
game to score. In the ﬁrst inning
two runs were secured; in the
third. one; while till: next two in
nings netted ﬁve more runs tor
the home team. Knox waited up
in the fourth inning. secured a hit
or two which brought in three
runs.

on the sixth inning on atlvo
base hit by Stevenson and errors
by Fislte and Clarke Knox scored

'two runs. The locsIs in their half

 

were only able score one.

Knox in the seventh by a number
of llit5. aided by gifts of base on
balls by Higgs, scorttl two more.
In this inning Doc distinguished
himself by pulling down a long
fly after it hard run. Grinnell
tailed score in thelrhalfand Knox
tied the scor'e in the ﬁrst half of
the eighth on two hits and three
case on balls. A comedy ot err
lots by Knox and four hits ena-
bled the locals to score ﬁve in
their half.

No fltt'tltet'scotes were made and
the game cluscd with the score i4
to 9 in tsvor ot the locals. The
work of Tait behind the bat and
the work of Herr in the out-ﬁeld
were the strongest features of the
home team's play. R. switzor, ot
the visitors, did excellent work at
third. accepting many dimctilt
chances.
