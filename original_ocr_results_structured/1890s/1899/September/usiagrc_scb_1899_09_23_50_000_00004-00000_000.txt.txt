'ing tnccting in Ellis hall yesterday

 

Ecarlet alto Black

Ellis.
The Ellis Society held its openr

nitcrnoon. The year opens with
every prospect to. good and eerie
cient work. and the prornlse of
meetings- full of hie and interest
The meetings are intended to be
not only a means of further train-
ing and development, but also a
recreation and a relaxation from
the strenuous labors ot the class-
room. The outline used by the
society indicates History as tlte

Literature for the winterterm, and
Art for the spring. The special
branch or History chosen tor study
this [all rs that of the French Revs
olution. The programme of the
opening meeting was as follows:

Vocal solo. Mrs. HCIE‘CI.

Short address by the incoming
President.

Extemporaneolts Work (vacnr
tion echoes):7The Noble Sisters
hood. Susie Orvis; Farm Lite.
Dorothy Nath; Sight-seeing in
Chicago, Blanche Messenger; The
Ellis Reunion, Grace Grenage.

Music. Lulu Williams.

Calocagathia.

The ﬁrst meeting or Calocaga-
thia was called together by Miss
Nellie Clarke. After the usual
preliminaries the society was
favored with a piano solo by Miss
Helen Millard, following which
the president in a most plcasant
manner addressed the society.
She emphasized the thought that
we were banded together for the
purpose of attaining high intelr
lectual culture. and that in strive
ing lor this our very best work
should be given. so that we may
attain the greatest beneﬁt from
our society work.

The remainder of the program
consisted of extemporaneous
work, and we would say that it

 

the future work of tllis kind is of
as high a standard as that given
yesterday, the soarety has great
reason to feel encouraged,

Miss Martha Fulton spoke at
The Dreyfus Case. Among oth
er things. Miss Fulton said it was
lll<Cl)’ that the precedent had been
established that hcrealtcr \hc
French soldier would probably
make his way by promotion ratlr
er than by bribing; that the tree-
donl of the press had also been
obtained.

The vocal solo by Miss Nellie
Brownell was very ably rentler»
ed and greatly appreciated by the
society. Miss Brownell kindly
responded to an encore.

Miss Martha Miller then spoke
on "Thc Boers in Afrlca.” Miss
Miller reviewed the condition of
the government in Arricu, saying
that England thought her claims
upon thc country jusllﬁﬁd her in-
terference. however it was still
doubtful whether it would be war
or peace.

Miss Stuart spoke on The C105-
ing or the Peace Conterence,
clearly stating the results brought
about under great diﬁﬁculttcs; but
the beneﬁt which may be derived
from this conference cannot be
measured by results. The fact
that nations are thinking of peace
will eventually bring it about
though not at the ﬁrst or even at
the second conference.
