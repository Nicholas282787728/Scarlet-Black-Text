IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER H. ‘899.

 

Grinnell Institute.

The program presented at Grins
nell Institute Wednesday evening
showed the effects of careful prep—
aration, and. all things being cons
sidered. was the best the society
has been favored with this year.
The fact that the entire program,
with the exception of the debate,
was given by new men, is still
more encouraging and predicts a
brilliant future for the society.

The ﬁrst number was “News of
the Week." by Burnside, given in
a concise and systematic manner.
but consisting too much of details
with which all are supposed to be
familiar. lather than comments on
the different events. This was
followed by one of the best papers
given in the society in recent
yearsV“Burial customs in Cuba.”
by Peterson. The paper dealt
with the ceremonies performed
over the dead and described the
Havana cemetery. The number
was more interesting because of
the author's experiences in Cuba.

“Direct Legislation” was the
subject of a well-prepared discus-
sion by McIntosh and Shephard.
The afﬁrmative held that the
scheme would be educative.thc
negative that the present system
would be all r ght if the right kind
of men were sent to the legisla-
tures. The former speaker made
an cspecially good impression. it
being his ﬁrst appearance before
the society.speaking entirely with»
out notes.

After a wellrrendered vocal solo
by Parish, Knapp gave two read-
ings from Edwin Markham.
“Dreyfus." and “The Muse of
Brotherhood.” criticising to some
extent the tendencies of the au.
thor.

The extemporaneous work of
the evening consisted of the fol-
lowing talks: “Cecil Rhodes." by
Chase;“The Election.”by'r’—\rnold;
and “President Hadley.” by Frisr
bie, With the exception of the
ﬁrst number this part of the pro
gram was hardly up to the lnsti~
tute standard.

The society was then favored
with a vocal solo by Miss Nellie
Boddy. Miss Lena Boddy added
much to the number by her pleas.
ing accompaniment. An encore
was kindly given.

“Resolved. That

the United

 

States has a literature of her own.
apart from England’s,” was the
subject of the debate for the even
ing. Thompson supporting the af»

ﬁrrnative and Otis the negative. '

Both
and

sides were ivellrprepared
conﬁned their arguments
strictly to the question. The de-
cision of the judges was in favor
of the afﬁrmative.

In the business session a portion
of the new constitution was dis-

cussed and adopted.
__...¥

Calocagathla.

The present South African sit»
uation was the subject which re.
ceivcd attention at the Caloca-
gathia meeting Friday afternoon;
and in order to get an impartial
view of the case, a discussion was
held of the relative rights of both
parties interested.

The case for the English was
given by Bessie Ricker, She gave
an interesting history of the orig-
inal settlement at Cape Colony,
the emigration of the colonists to
Natal and Orange Free State and
ﬁnally into the Transvaal. and
their struggles with the English
since that time. The grievances
of the Uitlanders are. the heavy
taxation without representation. a
lack of a stable‘constitution, relig-
ious disability imposed upon them
andunfairjudicialconditions. The
Boers are too conservative a peo-
ple to govern so energetic and en-
terprising a people as the Uit-
landers.

Miss Boddy. accompanied by
Miss Lena Boddy, sang a vocal
solo. which was very much enjoy
ed. and responded to an encore
with a charming little lullaby.

The case forthe Boers was then
presented by Nettie Sawyer, who
also treated the subject in a his

torical manner but from a differ
ent standpoint, She gave a sketch
of the character of President Kru-
ger and the Boers in general and
a statement of the present condir
tion of affairs.

Both Miss Rickel‘ and Miss
Sawyer gave exceptionally ﬁne
talks, and the program was both
interesting and instructive. Miss
Ricker deserves especial mention
as this is her ﬁrst appearance in
society work.

New presidents have recently
been elected at Yale, Brown, Am»
herst College, and tthniversity

Before one ofthe largest crowds
that ever assembled on the lowa
City football grounds. Grinnell
went down in defeat before the
strong lowa eleven this afternoon.

cost her dearly.
