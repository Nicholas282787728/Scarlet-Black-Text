Glee Club Trip.

The Glee Club trip this year,
though hardly as long as those of
feimer years. was one of the most
successtul trorn every point ot
view, which the club has triken.
wnh possibly two exceptions, the
houses were well ﬁlled and very
enthusiastic. The ﬁrst concert
was givenlat Cedar Falls, Friday
evening. and having been worked
up by students of the State Norr
mal, a large and appreciative audi-
ence attended. Each member of
the club were Normal colors, this
seeming to bring the audience in-
to close sympathy with the club.
The second date was at Waverly,
where the members of the club
were entertained over Sunday at
homes. The concert was very
well received by a large audience.
After the concert a reception was
given in honor of the club at the
home of A, w. Merrill. '90, super.
intendent of the public schools at
that place. Sunday evening a
sacred concert was given in the
Congregational church. At Osage
the ﬁlled and
the club gave one at their best
concerts. but were not so well
received as at other places. The
conceit Tuesday evening was
given at New Hampton. in the
mammoth Firenicn's Auditorium,
and being given ullder the aus-
pices ot the high school was well
worked up. and a large house was
the result. Although the club did
not appeai in its best form. sev-
eral amusing incidents happened
which counterbalanced the effect.
and the concert was very well re»
ceived.

At Mason City, owing to some
misunderstanding of the manage—
ment.tlic conceitwas notproperly
advertised and only a small audi-
ence attended, At Ackley, al-
though the audience was notvery
large, it was veiy enthusiastic.

house was well

 

It was probably at the last date,
Hampton, that the most satisfaCr
tory concert was given. The con
cert had been well advertiser] and
every seat was sold before the
club arrived in town. Here the
club showed its appreciation of
another large audience and gave
the best concert of the trip. On»
ing to the shortness of the trip the
members of the club did not her
come so worn out as formerly and
were all in very good spirits when
the trip ended

Much of the success of the trip
is due to the partstaken by Misses
Rew and Smith, and Messrs. Har-
ris and Dclavan, who were all well
received,

Minstrel Show.

So little having been said of the
Minstrel Show April 2t it may
have occurred to some that little
has been done in the way ot real
preparation. Nothing could be
more incorrect. For four weeks
the work has been going ahead in
a very quiet but nevertheless satr
isiacrory manner. It is now pose
sible to give a briet suggestion of
the program,

The performance promises to
be unusually strong in the line of
specialties. Among the features
will be sortie back and wing danc-
ing and a cake walk which is sure
to catch the crowd. The six end
men are notidle and promise to
spring some Very editying featr
ures. The orchestra of ﬁfteen
pieces and chorus of twenty
voices have yet lwo weeks to per-
fect their part of the performance
and‘will use the time to excellent
advantage.

The committee are very anxious
to secure lam! “gags” and jokes
and as an incentive announces as
prizes three reserved seat tickets
for the three oestjol'tes presented
Thejokes should be handed to
Mr, Ed Bray not later than next
Friday. Names of contributors
\Vlll be kept conﬁdential,

The stage will be profusely dec-
orated in the college colors. pre-
senting a pretty sight with the
chorus in tull evening dress.
Everything is running smoothly
and indications are the Union will
receive a snug bit of money.

Mass Meeting.

Next Tuesday evening at 8:00
o'clock. a mass meeting of the
students will be held in the chap
el to consider the amendments to
the constitution of the Student
Council, published in the issue of
March nth of SCARLET AND
BLACK. These amendments, il'
carried, will make the tollowing
changes in the present operation
of the system:

i. It will be restricted
lege courses

2 The faculty will be relieved
of all

to col-

poivcr to report cases of
cheating in examination, except
by producingevidencc in the torm
of wnltcn work, as already pro-
vided for in Article II, Section 1.

3. Only one witnessflnstead
of two as heretofore. will be re
quired to bring a person to trial.

It is of Vital importanceto Iowa
college and all who are connected
with it that every student give
this matter the most serious and
carefulconsideration. Unlesstlle
apathy‘ heretofore prevalent
among the majority of the stu-
dents is suddenly replaced by an
active and intelligent interest in
the Honor System and what it is
calculated to accomplish, we shall
all have to bear the humiliating
disgrace of publishing to the
world at large the fact that the
students of institution
still too feehlc to assume
slightest responsibility in the way
of self govcrnment, that we have
not the intcllccttial capacity and
moral courage to conduct out--
anything
It is

but a kindergaiten regime,

. therefore the imperative duty of

every student to come to this

meeting and to tliinlt beforehand

hand just what he is coming inr.
Baseball.

The weather so tar this spring
has been exceedingly nnlavurable
for baseball. but the time has
come when every man must don
his suit rain or shine. it we expect
to be in shape tor the opening
games, Next Satuiday the ﬁrst
game Wlll occur at Toledo and it
is important that every ball man
should be out next week in order
that there may be enough to com-
pose two teams and thus secure
practice.
