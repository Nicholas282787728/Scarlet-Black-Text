the most part only the men learn-
ed Ill tlcad languages and tllcil
forms. The end of education and
scholarship must be broadened,
for what we need IS an education
which will help us to realize our
highest ideals The highest ideal
of human action known to philos-
ophy is that of service, and that
involves at once a knowledge of
the relations of man to man. and
of man to the earth. it is through
a study of the science of Political
Economy that we come into this
knowledge, The study of Politi—
cal Economy, which is a duty to
all men, is an imperative duty to
the business man, tor it is merely
the analysis of what the business
man is dealing with all the time:
yet he is perhaps more behindr
hand in his duty in this lcspecl
than any one else. The people
are getting into sad straits in these

_ days ot the trust and monopoly,

especially land monopoly, with all
its attcndallt evils. They were
even turning to state socialism
Some one has got to study Politi-
cal Economy. Henry George did

 

this; he simpliﬁed l’nlili'cal Econ-
ltiny so that now tllcle is no ex~
