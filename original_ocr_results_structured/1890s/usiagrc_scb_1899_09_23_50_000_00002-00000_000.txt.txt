ONE FEATURE of college life has
not. in the past, rcceivcd the at-
tention we ovle it. That feature is
the work in the literary societies.
The tall and spring work has us-
ually beeil broken up by athletics
and too often have the evenings
appointed (or society work been
encroached upon by the various
social tunctrons of the college.
The criticism of those acquainted
with the situation, that society
work has taken a second place to
athletics, has been too true, But
an awakening seems to have oc,
curred and the college starts out
this year with an interest in socier
ty work, which is unprecedented
in years. one of the men’s socie-
ties begins work with its member
ship up tothe limit, and the other,
which has not held a meeting yet,
bids fair to be in tile same condi»
tion. This is as it should be.
Every man connected with the
college should be actively irlenti
ﬁed with one of the litelary sos
cieties, Whether you are a new
or an old man you can make no
better movc than to make applica
tion for membership immediately,
as both societies are nearly up to
their limit in membership. Let
us take hold of this part of our
college work with the same zeal
and earnestness that we use in our
athletics. Relcgate neither society
work nor athletics to a secondary
position, but let its Iteep them
both up to the hiin standard that
our athletics have always held,

been already several tirnesrepcat-
ed and has proved one of the most
valuable the Assocratio‘n has ever
offered. From a linguistic stand-
point Pror,Main is especially qual
iﬁed for a careful interpretation
of the text and those of the soph-
omores who have been wlth him
in the class room will need no sec»
ond invitation to this Bible class.
Room 27.

The course by Prof. Nollen for
the freshmen on the life of Christ
is one to which the committee wish
to call special attention as peculs
ial‘ly adapted to the ﬁrst needs of
a student entering upon the four
years' course outlined above II
is mainly chronological in its sys-
tem. concerning itself with the
events of Christ's ministry more
with its philosophy. although
the latter receives considerable at
tention also. It is hoped that the
new students will all avail them-
selves oi a privilege which this
class has already offered with
peculiar value tor several years
past, Room 22.

Principal Powell will continue
Pl'oi. Smith's Bible class for Acad-
emy students at the Congrega-
tional church.

All the classes will meet for the
ﬁrst time tomorrow, the college
classes at 9:15 and the Academy
class at Izzlg. I

The committee has initiated the
work as described above. and it
rests with the students to
carry it out by a generous attend-
ance. And, unless there is an ape
pieciative response to the wmk
which the protessors are putting
into their courses, it will probably
become necessary to discontinue
classes not suiiiciently interested
to respond, after the ﬁrst term or
semester.
