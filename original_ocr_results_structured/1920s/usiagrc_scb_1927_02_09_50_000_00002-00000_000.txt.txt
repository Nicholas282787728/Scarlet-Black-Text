Were it possible for John Ruskin, nineteenth centuryi
art critic, to board 1-1, G. \Vclls' “Time Machine," manipu-
late the lerers, and in a twinkling. ~iiiive on the Gi-innell
campus. what would be his reaction to the prospect he:
tore him? i
Douhtloss the author of “Stones of \‘cntce" would
find much to praise in the stately lines oi Herrick chapel.r
Perhaps .\ir Ruskin would discover much of the,
spirit of "The Seven Lamps oi Architecture" in Lllcl'zlllltr‘
ed arches oi the Quad ’lllgle Dillingrl'oonl .
Nor would the Gothic atmosphere or the Men‘s halls

be neglected were Ruskin to write a liook,“l\iornings in
Grinnell," as a result of his \isit to the campus. A \ c
author. Ruskin would he \illilfl'illd to point. out errors in

The attention of Grinnellians is called to the address
tomorrow atternoon in Herrick chapel by Sir George
Paish, of London. Without question, Sir George is can

of circumstances. The opportunity of hearing such a

Dear Si

This is an attack upon “iii-e drills"
in the Dorms it is to be hoped that
these facts will be seriously consider
cd by the upper classes who have cone
trol at present, and that some -

sponse other than nlorc “fire dl'ills’“
t will be forthcoming.

Fire drills and paddle parties are
bad icature oi the college life be
cause:

They create had mental
because:

1, They are based on a bully spirit.

2 They create and stimulate moi-c
llllllying sp it in uppcrclassmen. ,

3. They create in freshmen a feeling
of ayeision and resentment toward
nppcrclassmcn, rather than respect
and good fellowship.

They are nnfaii. because:

1. The “right." to participatc with a
paddle is an assumed right, obtained
only by iorce, and greater numbers.

2 Freshmen have no opportunity of
knowing or choosins their associates
in their building.

3, Upperciassmcn, lry force of “link
her are safe from rcpi-isal.

4, Fire drills give equal punishment
to those “Ill'ells” who do necd attellr
tion and to those who do not. ,

“One serious diiticulty that has to
be faced at the beginning in the re-
ligious interpretatlun of art is that art
and irrcligion, art and moral degrades
tion, art and the negation of all good-
ness may and often do exist side by
side," said Professor Cecil F. Lavell,
head of the department of History of
Thought, in an address beiore the

Prof‘. Lovell continued to say that

no one doubted that art contributed to
the joy of life. The question is whethr

Do Err it

Laval! declared. 1n enlarging on this
statement. the speaker said that just.
as Goethe, Carlyle, and Fichtc called
the visible universe the garment of
God, so in a sense art is the garment,
the visible expression, of the artistic
soul. And if that which is expressed
by the artist be something genuinc,
prophetic, and tundamental, and ii
the expression be adequate, then one
has a. great picture. Not only so, but
one can have a great picture in no othr
c‘r’way, and that is another way of
saying that the religion in a picture is
the final test of greatness.

is s ' lievcrcnce ot‘ Faith

According to Prof. Lavell, all great
periods or art begin in an earnest
reverence of faith just as the artists
who learned how to express themsel-
ves, reach their peak when the plane
of conviction coincides with perfect

 

sensesithe skill of generations wast-
ed in glitter, religion gone and not
ing left but a gorgeous Skull.

"1 do not. mean that you can judge
art by thin creed, my creed, or the
Apostles creed. I mean only that
some real creed. a genuine belief
about. permanent values, it genuine
effort to see in the outward aspects
of tile \vnrld a fundamental relation,
is the essential criterion of grellt
painting just as it is of great liter»
ntllre."
