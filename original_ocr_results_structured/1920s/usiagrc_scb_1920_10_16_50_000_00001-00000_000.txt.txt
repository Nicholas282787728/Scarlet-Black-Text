MYRNA SHARLOW N.
PLEASING PROGRAM

leperatic Arias Well Suited
‘ Voic%sings Number By
‘ Composer.

The opening entertainment of the
School of Music recital course, given
Friday night by Miss Myrna Sharlow,‘
prima donna soprano, was unusually
pleasing. Her program was well cho-
‘sen, the operatic arias, “Madame But-
terfly's Song to Her Child” by Puccini,
and “Saber Vorreste" from Vcr l’s
“lllasked Ball” being particularly suit-
ed to her voice A number, new and
dciighthfui to the Grinnell audience,
was "GztllivSoutllel'n Serenade" by an‘
Iowa composer, lllokreis. Miss sha ‘
luw's youth and charming personality
added to the intcrcst of the recital.

special mention should be made or
ythe excellent work at the piano by Mr.
Granville English, who was both a
sympathetic accompanist and a soloist
of remarkable ability.

,cht Il‘l'iildy‘evcliing Augusta cott—
low, one of the foremost women pian-
ists oi the world, and pupil oi Busoni,
will give the second concert of the
Course.
