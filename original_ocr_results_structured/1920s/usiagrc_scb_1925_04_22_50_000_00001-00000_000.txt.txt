The world's records broken were
in the quarter mile university medley-
h, Kansas. the half mile relay by [1-
Linois and the medley relay by Te -as.
Locke of Nebraska ran the hundred in
:09 5-10 but this tying of the old rec.
aid will probably not be officially rec
ognized because of the strong breeze
blowing at his back.

Grinnell and Ames were the only
Iowa schools to place first in the re-
latvs, Ames taking the two mile relay
and Grinnell the mile relay. Phelps
of Iowa took the 300 meter special
race easily and Bi-ookins won the
special 220 low sticks. Weir of No—
braska won thetlZO high hurdles with
Taylor running second and Kinsey of
Illinois was third. Taylor was lead-
ing but slipped when going over a
hurdle and dropped back to last place
from where he gained back to second,

In the mile relay the Grinnell team

Taylor) set a new record. The Maltese
Cross was in second place when the

fleet Pioneer passed his opponent and
led by five yards at the finish, setting
the new mark of 3:20 4.10.

Rinefort was the only other Grin-
nellian to place. taking a fourth in the
discus. His best heave was 130 feet,
1% inches. lacking about nine feet of
his home meet record.

Grinnell was entered in only one
other relay. the half mile. Three
teams running in succession broke the
old record and the new is now held
by Illinois in the time of 1:27 flat.

The climax of the discussinn of Stu-
dent government for the men or Grin-
zlell came yesterday when a ballot.
was sponsored by the Men's senate.
The final count showed that ninety-
five men were in favor of all forms of
student government in Grinnell, while
eight men were opposed to man.
A. tatal OI eighty-one men went on rec-
ord as favoring the present system of
self-government, although twenty men
voted as being opposed to the present
system.

A Scarlet and Black reporter ques~
tioned several representative Grilmeil
men as to their opinion of student
government. The following are re-
plies which he received:

Veldon Mayer: “There is no doubt
but that student government is the
most strict type of college govern-
ment. The executives elected by the
students are in a position to detect
more misdemeanors than are found
under faculty control. Nevertheless, I
believe that the principles of our pres
ent government are well founded. and
by perfecting the execution of them,
the solution to our problems can be
found.

Jack Bender: “I and opposed to SEUr
lieut government primarily- because
problems of a too weighty character
are handled by men of absolutely no
experience. The faculty ought to be
competent to handle this Jab; that's
one of the things it is paid to do. If
Gl-innell must still retain the essence
of student government, why not have

HARVARD PAPER

....“Lilemry Digest” Meets with Dis-

(From Des Moines News)

Cambridge. Mass, April 18.— (A.
F.)~The editors of the Harvard
latmpoon, college humorous publica-
tion, whose current issue known as
the ”Literary Digest" number was
suppressed yesterday by order of the
Boston and Cambridge police, plan to
take legal action.

In a statement today the editorial
board said its attorneys had advised
that the Lampoon did not violate the
law.

The Harvard crimson. under—
graduate papei. aid editorially today
that thc affair was “an unwarranted
abuse of the police power based upon
a fine technicality of the law."

The chief grounds on which the is-
sue was suppressed were the cover
design. n burlesque of the well known
picture of Washington crossing ilhe‘
Delaware. and in a picturc of a nude
woman, based on one of planets

George Simpson of Drake and Beebe
also of Drake. Taylor has with-
drawn, not desiring to compete at that
distance.

The Maltese cross will be repre—
sented in every relay save the medley.
Usually the Pioneers are entered in
th shorter events but this year for the
first time they have a four mile team
entered. it is composed of Meyer,
last years cross country captain,
Gould, Winner of the Grinnell-MiimeA
sota cross country race last fall.
Breitenbach, a veteran or the squad
and either mm or Whitley.

The mile relay team, composed of
Scharnweber. Kitchen. M. Jones and
Taylor, the same that set a record in
the Kansas relays last Saturday,
should take the mile event this week
end. Their time averaged fifty flat
each, and the time of 3:20 is fast
enough to take most meets. Cutting
a second oft of each man's race would
mean setting a new world's record.

The half mile relay is composed of
Taylor, Scbarnweber, L. Jones and
Kitchen, The quarter mile relay will
probabily be the same outfit.

Rinefort, Meeter and Bogs are en-
tered in the weight events. Should
Rinefort get going on the discus he
should place. Meeter is also entered
in the javelin.
