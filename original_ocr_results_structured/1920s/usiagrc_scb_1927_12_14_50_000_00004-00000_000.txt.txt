Graduate Tells Of
Berea In Letter to
Personnel Director

462 nerea college
Ber-ca, Kentucky
'Dear Friends:

Tire iongerl tay here, the more
eager i am to w itc or my satisiaciion
and enthlis sm in Berca. I really do
not see how I escaped hearing about
Bel-ea tor as many ,ears as I did. or
course, the wcaving is the thing a
great many people kiiow and know
only about it. and Ingree that the
weaving industry is both interesting
and nonderlul, but there are other
things just as remarkable. I really
shall never be able to tiiank you
enough, Mr, Welirhan, tor recommend»
ing rue hero, or I should say now, or
recommending Bel-ea to me,

, In the tirst place, Eel-ea is in a
particularly beautiful spot or Keir
Lllck3~many sontlievners say tllis is
one of the choice spots or scenery in
the south. It is right on the D -c
Highway, lovely, hospitableelouklug
place run by the college, and cousee
qucutly many wealthy people stop at
the Tavern. It is very oiten the bee
ginning of their interest in Bel-ea sille
dents. There is a gift shop in the
Tavern which sells the woven goods
made at the College Fireside, wood
carving products, made in that indi

try (by the way, the wood work in»

trigerators to sell) and many aprons
and things made in thc sew g classes

To return to the sooner} we have
the beautiful and prosperous Ellie
Grass country on one side and the
foothills or thc climber-lands on the
other sides. These mountains are
Wooded and have many rocky rorma—
tions. There are delightful paths to
climb, Hiking is the chief amusement
and already I have become an enthus—
iast for mountain clinlbing. The aut-
\Imn colors here have been most
gorgeous. Of couse, there are many
kinds of trees that I had never seen
helore; gum. persimmon, holly, beech,
(i have seen them) chestnut, dog»
Wand, tnlip, etc. The college owns a
log cabin out in the mountains (shout
eight miles, where iacnlty groups may
spend week-ends, and I have had one
such lovely weekend. The students
go with chaperones to a bungalow, as
it is called, on top of the pinnaci s, and
every fall each school has its day to go
in a group to the mountains tor a nice
pic. This Mountain Day is

The campus is very large and the
most beautifully kept oi any I've ever-
seen. I venture to say it ranks with
beautitul Campuses. Each oi the
schools and the hospital have their
corners or sections. The Fullndzl-
tiuniJIinior High is the largest, ale
