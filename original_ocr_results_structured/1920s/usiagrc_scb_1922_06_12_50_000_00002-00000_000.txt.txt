Till. I LlUllL IS BRIGHT.

An announcement Was made in

chapel Friday morning by President,

Main to the effect that the members
of Delta Phi Rho, former men‘s secret
fraternity in Grinnell, and the mem»
bers oi the secret sororities at the
quadrangle have repudiated forever the!
idea and the Spirit of fratcmities and

sororities in Gl‘innell College. The

amp upon which it rests. As the old
alumni pass on the new ones must Lake
their place, and there is no .doubt but
that the class of 1922 will prove thcnr
selves worthy of the college that is
theirs.

They realize now, and will rcalize it
cevn more so in the future, that-the
college performs a service to hu-
manity, and that our educational in-
stitutions are of incstimabie value.

They should be willing to insure to'

coming ‘ generations the privilege
which they have had themselves. The
college must keep bace with the do.
velcpinent of the country and of the
world, and the alumni of each institu-
lion are the custodians of the luturC
welfare and continued growth of the
colleges and universities from which
they come. The following editorial
[mm the Des lloincs Register is a far
more able argument for the college
and for its support by alumni and
friends than we can put forth. We
therefore give it in full, in the hope
that those who may some time hesi—
tate to lend their time and energy to
the furtherance of education will ﬁnd
something in it which will remind thorn
of the need and the value of such ef—
fort. ' *

university training in the humanities,

tain amount of physics and chemistry,

dred boys specially trained with the
idea that they are going to follow some
particular career."

We may agree or not with Mr. James
and Mr. santnyanv. that babies will
walk when the time comes whether
we coax them .into many tumbles or
not, that boys will become men and
girls women, that “manhood and sa-
gacity will ripen of themselves,” that
a college education is a liarloying
with time to give the boy and girl a
better poise. That speculnhon is one
thing, But the testimony oi the le'
ing hanker'ot Canada of his own ob-
servation of college boys tud exper-
ience'with them is quite ano’ner. If
those of speculative turn will go with
Mr. James and Mr. Santnyana, and
those of practical turn with sir Ed-
mund Walker, we all shall arrive at
the same point as to one thing, that
the years of youth ought to be spent
in the contemplation of the great
things of life, in the conﬁdence of a
larger usefulnesn than will ever come
from learning merely to do things.

Wu had a practical demonstration
in our preparation for the war that
ought not to be lost on us. Not only
were the training schools for army
otficers put in the colleges, but com-
missions werc reserved almost exclus-
ively for college men. So far did this
go that 150 men from Yale who had
no military training at all were given
lieutenant commissions because there
was a rush order for officers, and be-
cause they were Yale men and had
had a Yale athletic training. The call
of the army was for men who could
most spccdily adapt themselves to the
physical exposure and the mental
mastery of war, and in both instances
these men were found to he the college
men, the exceptions so rare as to be
negligible.

The knockdown argument for col-
lege training, the argument of tho
lial‘drheadcd, is the readily ascertain-
able fact that the collcgc man in nine
cases out of ten will surpass the non-
coilegc man in the practical details
of whatever both undertake to do, no
matter how exclusively the noncollcgc
man may have devoted himself to de-

been made to give the men somethi‘ng
tangible to work for, and incidentally
it is hoped that ”P. T," track. events
may be a. means of uncovering Vain»,
able material [or Pioneer track toams.‘

ﬂy Raymond W. Rogers.

The rating and Judging of exercises
in physical education is a problem
which has been and still is a hard one
to solve. The greatest battle of the
physical educator in America was for
a recognition of the neecssity of physir
cal training in the public schools and
colleges. ,This was due to t c uncer-
tainty of educational autho es as to
the value of physical education. The
statistics of the war draft reg rding
the physically unht removed the last
roubt among the most skeptical as to
the necessity of physical training.

There arises now another task, just
as difficult as the ﬁrst, and j 't‘ as him
portant; this is the application of the
Program. ,

Physical training has been crowded
into the curriculum, the administration
wants to know the cost. The psy«
chologist wants experiments and evl-.
denc‘e expressed in ﬁgures; all are
waiting for results. Physical train-
lug stands for more than things physi-
cal; it will and is ﬁlling a gap in
education that education heretofore
has necvr been able to bridge, because
it has separated the mental rrom the
physical, it has been artiﬁcial.

Many mistakes have been made in
the past, some of these have been be-
cause we have had no practical method
of rating men, they were graded upon
one thing .only, attendance at class. If
physical training deserves a regular
place in the curriculum, it should he
accorder the same treatment, as all
other subjects, There is no alterna—
live. The work should bc graded and
itbc student be given a rating, with
promotion depending upon a satisfac-
tory accomplishment. Yet in a iew
school is this being done, either be—
causc a method of procedure is un-
known or because conditions make it
impossible to attempt such a method.
! Many believe that the best way to
rate the physical ability and perform-
ance of the individual is to measure
the result with a tape stopwatch, or
any other accurate instrument. Meas-
urements leave no room for doubt, and

the performer himself can vertify the 14 1

results. I believe that the following

results will help to convince some that 1
