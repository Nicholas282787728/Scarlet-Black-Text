WHY NOT ‘l

Don't you thing we ought to have a>

pen meeting? Let's lion’t let the spirit
lag. We heat Missouri—now we
have some real excuse for genuine eu—
thusiasm. But we can't take further
victories for granted.

Tl‘liy can't we have just as much
interest and spirit when we're Winning
basketball games as when we're losing

THE NEW YEAR

The New Year-1924. What Should it,

mean to us?

It is a milestone on the short trail
our footsteps follow
knowing into the Unknown.

It means that we have spent anoth-
er year in learning or forgetting, in
progressing or receding, in generating
happiness or unhappiness.

It means a 366 clay consignment of
Nature's most precious raw material,
Time. Nature may Sprinkle the earth
with precious metals, may lay up in-

l
exhaustihle stores of coal, and oil, and

gas, and may add to thesefaster than
pigmy man can scratch the surface ol.
the Earth’s resources. But even Na—
ture horscll cannot create Time, con-
not recall it wasted moment, cannot

pack more than twenty-four hours in-

from the Un- ‘

uutplzly and outsoorc llssoul'l did you
l'enlize that the squad had spent all
but about three days of the Christmas
vacation here getting in shape [or the
season. While you were enjoying all
the monilold pleasures of d holiday
recess and devastating the bountiful
output of mother’s kitchen, they were
training here in Gl'innell.

That is sacriﬁce that merits recogni—
tiDlJ.

This is the season of the year, when
incl-chants are completing their in—

It is the season of reckoning.

Perhaps it might not he vain imi-

trom the world o2 business—t0 pouse
now and then in the onward. whirl oi
activity to discover Whether or not our
lives are gaining or losing. Inti'ospec—‘

struggle upward by the slow process
of evolution, but'evolution is far too
slow for the individual. ‘

about the nature of lightning. With elec-

evolvedthe theory that the puny sparks of

Franklin substituted fact for theory— by
