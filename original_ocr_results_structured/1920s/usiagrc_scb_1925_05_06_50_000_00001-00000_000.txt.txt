Drake is looming up Stronger than
expected, however, for in her viclory
over Ames last Saturday she uncov—
ererl one of the most formidable teams
01 Cinder artists that she has had in
recent years. Headed by its versu-
iile captain. Orebaugll, the Drake
squad appears to be especially strong
in the track events and should scare
heavily there. Ol'ebaugll was hlgh
point man in lbc Drake-Amos dual
with firsts in the hurdles and broad
jump 4nd .1 tie for first in the high
jump. Taylor, Pioneer capmin. is es-
pecially Strong in Orchuugb's events
and will undoubtedly place first in
both hurdle races. Both Di his (camp
malcs, Green and Niblo. snould‘furi
nisli a thrilling race with Ol‘ebaugh
for second honors. oicbaugb will
probably place ﬁrst in the high lump
as he is capablc of clearing almosl six
feet. but Taylor should force him ill
the llmzlil jump.

Rineforl, who tossed the discus iii
feel at Lincoln last week should win
that event handily as well as the shot
pul, since Drake is very weak n the
weight crouls. Lingculcllcr should
