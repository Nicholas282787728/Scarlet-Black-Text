For on this particular day all Grin-

we're going to sit in Section 23, on

not accordant with the former rec

STUDENT BROKERS SEEK WEALTH
AND INVEST WITH PIERCE ARROW

 

At last the way to fortune has been
discovered.

Reduced to its simplest terms, it is
this. You sell what you haven‘t got,
buy what you didn't sell at a price
lower than you didn't pay for it but
should have, pay the broiler out of the
proﬁt. which you don't deserve any of,
but want some anyway, and, lo and
behold! your money is doubled.

Proving that there is one born exery
minute, about twentyrﬁve young men
HE the Gl'lllnell Campus have each ill-
Vesteli amounts wiring from ﬁve to ten
dollars in ct proposition which may,
01' “lily not, make them immensely
wealthy. With the resulting one huna
dred and ﬁfty dollars they sold about
three hundred dollars worth of Pierce-
Arrow stock on the New York market
a few days ago.

[\venlyrﬁve decide that it has dropped
far enough, they will buy the stock
which they sold and divide the differ—
ence. And, on the other hand, if
Pierce—Arrow continues to go up, their
delicate margin will fade away, and
some day a kind broker of the cast
will write them to the effect that they

or course, it’s an honor to be a stock—

toward being president of it. And the

EHIDHEHS MEEl AMES

Aggies Have Margin of Victories Over
Smrlel ullll Black in Twenty
Seven Years of Rivalry.

TO PLAY WIVEGONEENG

Strong Conference Elev-ens in Me
In Front of Ames Homecomors in
Yearly Grill Game.

Saturday, Grillllell meets Ames on
the Hitler’s home field in the twenty—
seventh game between the two rivals.
Ames now holds a substantial lead
on the number of victories, but the
Pioneers are determined to close that
gap.

Aside from being stabs enemies.
both have their position in the His-
souri Valley to think of. Iowa State
goes into this game with a. percenh
age of .667, while Grinnell is close
behind with '.500 and a, victory for
either will materially advance its rat-
ing in me conference. Ames has add—
ed inspiration from the fact that a
large homecoming crowd will he on
hand to cheer them on.

Ames Going strong

Ames opened this year’s campaign
with a victory over Simpson by a
comfortable margin, but the follow—
ing week received a set back at the
hands of the Wisconsin Badgers. In ,
this game Ames put up a good fight
for the first half, but weakened in
the second stanza and consequently
lost by a 30 to 0 score. Next came
two conference triumphs, Kansas go—
ing down to a 20 to a defeat and
Washington being subdued by 2843.

These two victories put Ames in a
tie with Missouri for the Valley lead— '
crship, and last week they met at
Columbia. After ollelllying and out ,
gaining the Tigers the Cyclones
crumpled and were forced to accept
a. 23 to 6 defeat. This loss put a
damper on ncach \Vllldlnzm's cham—
plonslnp aspirations and has put a
now sp it of fight into his charges.

Ilrcnll Lost 1' or

The Cyclones are smarting under
thc memory of last year’s defeat at
the hands of Grinncll. By a supreme
lost minutc el'J'mt the Pioneers nosed
out a one point victory over their op-
ponents and at the same time knocked
tho, clean record of Ames clear out of
the lot. The AmBSrGl'lnllell game for
the past three years has been one of
the closest of the season and this
week's game should prove no cxcep.
tion.

Ames has shown herself to possess
much offensive power. and her backs
are fast and shifty, This fact is prov—
en by thrco of them being among the
first seven scorers in the conference,
and tho total scores of the team being
much greater than any other Valley
team.

Bolull’s Dangerous

Captain Johnny Behm is playing his
last year for the Cyclones, and has
come to be a marked men- among his
opponents. Being one of the fastest
men in uniform, and having a thor.
ongh sense of the game, puts him
down as a dangerous ball toter. Behm
has starved for the past two years and
has performed in great style so far
this season. Brother Norton is an
able assistant and is speedy and
heavy. He is one of the Cyclone’s
scoring aces. Cory is handling the
line smashing from fullback and is
proving very effective as a score pro—
ducer, l-Ie hits hard and keeps going
until the whistle blows. The other
half, Hall, also does his share of line
pllmging in addition to being a good
defensive man.

The Ames line is composed largely
of veterans, eoe, Kingery. Thornburg,
Meyer and Bond having been seen on
Ward field last year, Coe and Bond
are respected for their ability at the
receiving end of passes and on the
defensive they present two obstacles
to opposing backs. Klugel‘y is a clev—
er man who has been moved in to
tackle from end. Mayer and Thorn-
bnrg are the two heaviest men on the
squad and handle themselves well.
Both are consistent players and help
produce openings for the lighter back—
liold men.

The Ames squad has been priming
for the Pioneers and nothing would
please them better than to dcfcut the
Scarlet and black crew and avenge
last year’s mishap. Holl'ClCl' the
Glillllcll offense has hccn tuncd up
