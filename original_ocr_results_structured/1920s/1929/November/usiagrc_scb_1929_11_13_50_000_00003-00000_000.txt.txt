“Penny" Thomas will probably
make the girls' track team this year.
She ran the Colonial-Quadrangle
course in record time Sunday ever
ning. She wasn’t even tired when
she finished, just a little chilly, Butr

, tons are so unreliable.

Judging from the number of ar—
rests made at the Grinnell Highe
Marshalltown game Monday, the oc—
casion wasreven more joyous than
the college homecoming. Or perhaps
it's because these Morshalltown men
aren’t as clever as Grinnell college
alumni.

Mollie Merrick says in her Hollyﬁ
wood column, concerning “our own
movie star," (ugh): The movies diSr
covered Gary Cooper. They took him
o'ut of the western country, but they
couldn’t take the country out of him.
He's a knockout when he sticks to
type, but put him in a dress suit,
and you somehow wish you hadn’t.

We reckon it won't he long now un-
til the irredoutable Billie Crouch
‘sends over the country pictures of
the hero, all decked out in formal at-
tire, with this caption beneath:
"Graceful Gary, Looks Suitable In
Any Suit."

Ernest McIntire, who was Schedul—
ed to appear as toastmaster at the
stag dinner Saturday evening, was
called out of town, and was unable to
be present.

Ernest McIntire was among those

day evening.

Twenty Years From Now

Mr. Hugh Edwards Esq, and Hon.
’John Gleysteen have both sent their
personal checks for three dollars to
the State University of Iowa's Ath-
letic Department. It seems that
when both men were college students
at Grinnell they crashed the gate at
an Iowa-Minnesota. football game by
posing as high school athletes who
were separated from their Coach who
had the tickets. This conscience
money will be donated to the Car-
ue'gie fund which is used to buy big-
ger and braw-nier athletes for the
State University. .

The ltd—eds pet peeve this week is
the starvation diet of last Saturday
night occasioned by the Stag Dinner.
Such campus opinions as these have
been heard:

"What a beautiful rainy night tor
a picnic supper: Such thoughtful
realism!”

"We may only be deers,
have appetites like stage."

“Hunger strikes aren't even neces—
sary around here." ,

Etc, etc., etc. . . .

Famous last words from the “sac
cial life of Sir Francis Fee: ”I have
never been to a public dance, and I
never expect to attend one.” The
only comment we’ve heard is “Lucky
public!" And “May Sir Francis en:
joy a life of pink teas!"

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Archery Proves
Popular Part of
Women’s Sports

If Robin Hood and his merry band
from Sherwood forest could miracu-
lously appear on the Grinnell college
campus today, they would find some
stiff competition in archery from the
Grinncll cereds, Introduced here
this fall, archery has proved one of
the most popular girls’ sports, and
will be hereafter a regular part of
Lhe curriculum in physical education,
Forty girls have become efficient
marksmen and are preparing enthu-
siastically for a tournament to be
held soon.

Archery is held by Miss Harriet
Koglin, instructor in physical educa-
tion for women, to be one of the
most beneﬁcial girls' sports, since it
not only keeps the girls out of doors
but also corrects their posture. It
stimulates competition among the
girls and makes each girl compete
with herself by trying to hit the
bull‘s eye more accurately.
