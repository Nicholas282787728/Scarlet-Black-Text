garnered by Thomas, Clark hull was
able to nosc out their ancient rivals,
Dibble, by a scant tu‘osthlrds or a
hoint.

Dibble tricd ill vain to come out
on top or the score list by tuning
first in the 220 low sticks and ties
ior iirst in both the 110 yard high
hurdles and tho mile run. But by
adding seconds in the 100 and again
ties ior second in the 220 and the
2330, their score totaled only 21 and
1-3 points which was not enough to
reach up to the iii-st place sum goth»
ered by Clark, whose first in the 100,
220, half mile relay and a tie for
first in the mile run, coupled with
a second in the ill) enabled it to
scrape together 22 points and a hair-
breadth ﬁrst place for the first half
of the meet. Both teams were in thc
money in about every other event.

Murphy, of quadrangle tame. put
his best efforts forward and downed
a select field of quarter-milers in
one of the best races of the afternoon.

Campus Opinion j

Do you think an organization, cor»
responding to the imntcrn, should bc
organized among the women of Grin-
nell college?

nlanchc Hillsebusi‘l believe that
thc Cup and Gown should carry on tor
the women and the campus tunctions
whnt lantern neriorrus for the men.
Cup and Gouu might keen its pres—
ent organization and method oi elec—
tron. but make itscli more vital in
Grinncll liic by doing something col-ls
structive,

Elizabeth Cook—Yes, 1 think there
is a place ior such an organization
on llle Cfln‘lnlls, The Lantern has rec»
ouuucudcd several henciicinl changes
and without doubt there arc changes
in quadrangle lire tllzti. a girl's Dr—
sauimtion could criecl,

Eva Adams—No, l do not. The pur—.
pose oi such an organization is a
worthy one, but the women have
more organizations now than they
can do justice.

Vera SterneriNo.
numy organization already. and be—
sides there is no need ior it. The
business it would do, is taken care
ol by other bodies already.

Kate Ceggeshallil would say yes,
if all of the woniens organizations
could be equally as well organized as
the men's. As it is, captains oi ath—
letic teams are selected within a few.
da ot the iinal game, and it would
be dilticult to install a member on
such very short notice.

Helen WhitcbillJrhcre are too
many organizations now, and if every.
one who bclunged to the others would
do all they re supposed to, that would.
suiiice.
