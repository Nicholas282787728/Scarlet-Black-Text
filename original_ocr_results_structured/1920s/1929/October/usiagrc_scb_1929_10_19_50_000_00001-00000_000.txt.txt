Doped to win the ﬁrst conference
tilt of the current football season by
a 13 to 12 margin, Captain Harold
Rose will lead the Grinnell football
team against Washington university
this atternoon before the largest
homecoming thong ever to witness
the annual gridiron event here.

Despite the fact that the Pioneers
are outweighed by some ten pounds
to the man, critics helieve that the
fast moving Crinneli offensive will be
able to match the driving Bears
touchdown for touchdown and they
are banking on Raff's mlllion'dolkir
toe, which accounted for the 1 to 6
victory for the Pioneers in 1925, to
again turn in a spectacular perform-
etude. ’ > ' ' -

The eyes of the Missouri Valley
conference are on today‘s game here.
There is' no blinking the fact that
Drake is unquestionably the Missouri
Valley champion for the season on
paper—hut if Grinncll can trim the
st. Louis visitors is will make the
grasp which the Bulldogs have on the
title just a hit ‘more precarious. _

While the fans"of the circuit are
gazing at the results, the eyes of the
homecomers will be turned to two
points, the veteran players, to ap-
plaud their work as it deserves. and
toward the sophomore members of
the squad who will he expected to
bear the hurden of play next year.
Outstanding among this latter group
is the speed merchant from Rock 1s-
land, dougbty Hank Thomas, who,
Coach Fuzz Watt assures us, wilr
see action in a. part of today's game.
Thomas, who waltzes away from
tacklers by series after series or
sharp turns, will be expected to take
over the quarterback post, ably
handled by Ernie McIntire for three

BY ARTHUR DE PERSIA

"The popular conception of the
movie actor as simply a puppet, on
automaton who follows the instruc-
tions of a director and adds nothing
of his own to the role he plays, is
misguided," said Gary Cooper, noted
film star and eeri‘lnnellian in an in—
terview Friday evening at Langan
hall.

"if that were the case the pro-
ducers could enlist from the"thouse
ends of extras who besiege the Ho!-
lywcod studios, enough pretty faces
and impressive physiques to keep
their companies going for years, with-
out paying thc enormous salaries to
individual stars which they now ex-
pend.

Specialty Must be Developed

"The actor must have some. other
ability than that of imitation," the
f a m o u s film-cowboy continued.
“There must be some speciality, which
he has developed, and can ‘sell' to the
producers, such as throwing a lariat.
riding a horse, or even throwing a

 

 

College rind1 City Combine—

Plane Burns During Races;
Airport Dedicated
Friday Morn.

Gary Cooper, Grimlell Student
from 1922 to 1924, and now famous
as an actor with Paramount pictures,
returned to Grinnell by air yesterday
morning for the Diamond Jubilee and
College Homecoming. His arrival
aroused greet excitement at the Air-
port, where he took part in the de-
dication exercises and Started on its
way the first full day of the cele-
bration, which began last evening
with the historical pageant, "The
Pioneers of Progress," in the high
school auditorium.

It had been announced some Lime
ago that Gary couldn't come. His
latest picture, “The Virginian," was
ﬁnished too late for him to come by
train and hls managers didn‘t want
him to ﬂy, but Gary had long plan-
ned to make the trip. on Thurs-
day he stepped aboard a plane at Los
Angeles and started out. He was
met at Kansas City by Harry Ogg,
Newton manufacturer, in his mono-
plane "Smilin’ Thru". and by Mayor
w. C. any of Crinnell, and landed at
the local airport at 11:10 yesterday
morning, where, after stepping out
of the plane. he was photographed
with “Prexy” and Governor Hammill.

Renews Acquaintances.

For the remainder of the day he
was engaged in renewing old acqu-
aintances, attending the air races
and getting settled at Langan hall,
where he occupied part of a suite
while here and where he will stay
during his sojourn in Crlnnell Last
evening he took dinner with Presi»
dent and Mrs. Main. Today he plan-
nod to spend the entire, day celebrat-
ing Homecoming, and announced
that the dance Saturday night was
included in his schedule. _

The opening day of the Diamond
Jubilee yesterday was marred by'one
event; one of the ﬁfteen planes en-

pinch the afternoon burned in the

24-mile speed race for planes a cubic

inch displacement of 510 or less,

gasoline catching ﬁre when the pilot,

Roy Liggett, of Watertown, s. 13.,

Cue Mishap. ‘

The afternoons program, outside
the mishap mentioned, was run
through successfully. The climax to
the day's events was a triple para~
chute jump by Prod Welch of Cedar
Rapids. Individual‘nl'scing honors for

custard pie."

When asked whether talented in-
terpretation in itself was not a sufr
ficient justification for the high sal<
sries paid to actors, Cooper replied,
“Yes, an inborn interpretative sense.
It differs from the qualities found in
painters, writers, and other artists
only in that it is a receptive rather
than a creative faculty. No director
can inject it into the actor any more
than an English professor can inject
literary genius into his pupils. In
the last analysis it is the actor who
determines his role and not the direc-
tor.”

Stars Like Talkies.

in reply to the question as to the
reception given the talkies by the ac.-
tors, Cooper said, “On the whole,
film stars are in favor of the vita-
phone and movletone. It gives each
scene a realism which was lacking
in the silent drama. Then, too, since
it cuts out the director's chatter in
the final shots, it removes a disturb-
ing element and throws the actor on
his own."

WHAT GARY SAm.

“I just want to be one of the
folks at Grinnell for a few days
and then go back to work," Gary
Cooper announced to are thrilled
crowd at the dedication of the air-
port Friday morning, noon afber
he landed.

President Mala in his speech in-
troducing Cary described him as I,
“one who has contributed to the
fame of Grinnell in many ways.
He is ﬁne and loyal and contri-
butes to the joy oi living."

Cooper was n little bashful
about starting his speech. “Well,"
he began, and there was a long
pause, “I had better get the load
off of my mind quickly. I am not
a speech maker, never have been.
and am not so constituted But
1 would llke to say how I feel
about coming to Grinneil. I have

on the side." ,

After a. week of perfect October
weather, Homecomers and students
this morning were greeted by a driz-
zling rain. No one’s enthusiasm was
lessened, however, for as Cary Cooper,

Following the Airport dedication

no college classes were held, a big
