1929 Pioneer

Gridmerl as Versatile Group

Captain Hill-old Rose—The black-
haired Pioneer leader is playing his
ﬁnal year of football for Grinnell col-
lege and doing an able job. He has
been a regular at the fullback post
since his freshman year and is one
of the original "tough guys” of the
eleven. His 175 pounds stopped al-
most half of the plays at Ames as
he backed up the line with almost
unbelieveable speed. He is the per-
soniﬁcation of the Grinnell spirit in
the game and he was one of Coach
Watts wild, wild deuces, until the
new uniforms came for he sported
the number two early in the season.
He has changed to one on the new
uniforms however. The captain hails
from Winterset.

Ernest McIntire—Mac is probably
known to many of the returning grid
fans, either through his vocal powers
or his great defensive play. For
three years he has been quarter-
back tor the Pioneers, playing unas-
sisted by substitutes until this year.
When dealing out sweaters to McIn-
tire the mentor forgot his poker
hands and shot him a lucky rl. Ernie
won honorable mention when a
sophomore for his great tackling
against Nebraska. Last year he set
the stands in an uproar when he spill-
ed two interferers and stopped Swede
Gchert of Marquette after a 55-yard
sprint. He weighs 161 pounds and
is on Audubon product.

Henry Thomlf it comes to the
mass times the velocity, as they fig-
ure in physics, compute the approx-
imate difficulty of lo-second Thomas
as he shoves his 152 pounds over the
turf ziz»zaging at run speed. Thomas
is filling in for Molntire this season
but should develop into one of the
greatest Pioneer regulars in recept
years. He can run, pass and kick.
Since Rosey has forsaken his number
two‘, Thomas has taken it over and is
doing well in his captain's former in:
signia. Rock Island is. Thomas‘.
home. . '

Itusaeu'ltuu— Just as his name
implies, Ruff is rough on the opposi-
tion. it isn't often that he cavorts
throughout the entire game, but
when he’s in the contest the Grinnell
touchdowns are usually scored. His
passing was the big feature of the
1928 season and homeccmers will

remember him as the sophomore who ,

last year booted Grinneli to a three
point victory over Ames, while his
educated toe also brought victory _to
the Pioneers last Saturday in the
Marquette game with a piacekick
from the thirty-five yard line in the
last quarter. Passing and kicking

are the strong points of this ottum~
wa youth, who has another year of
competition after this, *

Ed Liedtke—dust because he's
built like a brick and has a name the
sports writers cannot spell. is no
reason that Liedtke Shouldn't_ show
up well today. He is a two year vet-
eran on the Grinnell gridiron and is
a hard hitting back of the old type.
He is short but he snags passes when
they come within reach. in the Grin—
nell offense last Saturday against
Marquette he was a big cog.

Ben Douglas—When Bel: left Ce<
dar Rapids to come to Grinnell he
was hard to stop. He still is. Last
year he won letters in football. has»
ketball and track apd he’s going
strong as a junior now. He scored
one of the touchdowns against Mar—
quette last year with a 12—yard dash
through center. Although he gets
some work as a second shift man
for Captain Rose, he will probably
work at halfback a part of the time
today. His number is 21.

Claude Richeyi’Tbe shifty Villisca
lad made the first play of the season
this year when he nabbed a Penn
kicckotf ‘and went down the sideline
for 60 yards. He is fast and hard
to hang on to. it is likely that he
would have won his letter in 1925
but for some broken ribs. His strong
point is spinner plays.

Meredith Heldrldge—l-leldridge will
pit his three years of football exper-
ience_and.159 pounds against Gus
Butz, 215 pound Washington center
todayi Heldridge comes from Fort
Dodge; has red hair. and was one of
theestars of the line last year. He
played guard last season but is doing
a good job at center this season.

‘ Robert Bradlord—Crown Pornt,
1nd,. tilrne out one o: the heaviest
me; of the Pioneer eleven in Brad-
ford, 182-poulld guard. Bradford

«didn't pick up a regular position last

season but is seeing plenty of action

'this year.

Charles Parish—n home town boy
who loves to speak his little piece,
Parish has upheld the guard posts for
Grinpell for three years. He is now
playing his final year for the Pio-
neers and has the honor of being the
heavieSt'man of the regular eleven.
tipping the scales to 185 pounds.

pear Chrlstoffersen—Chris is like-
ly to see action today. He is a 165
pound sophomore and a fighter of the
old schoo ‘ He plays without a beside
gear at t mes and if he wants to tear
through the line he is likely to do it.
He is another Cedar Rapids boy. He
made his first bid for fame in 1928

 

Tebbens Becomes Campus
Editor Next Wednesday

Beginning with next Wednesday's
issue of the SCARLET AND BLACK,
Bernard Tebbens will serve as
campus editor. John Canning, who

has acted in that capacity since last.

spring vacation. will serve again as
a news reporter.

ing out for the editorship of the pa-
per, are eligible to serve a term as
campus editor.

in the frosh—varsity contest when he
picked up a fumble and ran so yards
for the only yearling score.

Paid Klincfeltcr—This long-armed
tackle is another of the three-year
men on this year's eleven. He hails
from Conrad and weighs 182 pounds.
and when those long arms start
swinging back and forth out there,
it's always too had for the opposing
line and backs.

....Corieton Humphrey — A lanky
youth from Silvis, Illinois. Humphrey
won comment last season when but a
sophomore he sprinted down un-
der punts to spill the opposition, of—
ten beating the ends.

Lowell Walker—Walko won his
letter as a reserve tackle in 1923 but
is the one man always certain of a
berth this year. He weighs 175
pounds, sports a number 19 on his
back and usually smears a play on
his end of the line. He has heen‘gui .
ing ground this season on tackl -
around plays, also. . . ‘_

James Tlpton — Tip transferred
here from Kansas last year and is
now a junior. He started out as a
guard but he is fast and his 170
pounds is just what Coach Watt
needed to fill out his roster of four
tackles. Tip is a certain comer.

Charles Briggs~Upholding a tam»

ous name, Briggs draws pictures on
the gridiron with the opposing inter-
ference before he makes his tackle
slight of build and a secretary by
trade, he uses his nimble fingerssto
snag passes when least expected.
Itoyoe Minier—“rted” stands over
the lsbbfoot mark where the atmo»
sphere is rather humid and designs
only occasionally to look down at the
rest of the world. He is another_ of
Coach Watt's pass catching wingmen
and when he goes after the oval it's

i usually plucked out of the air with

some considerable degree of deftness.

Charles Bilto a Weighing 175
pounds, Bilto came from Boone last
season to pound the line from a pos-
ition as fullback on the frosh squad.
Being fast and handling himself well,
he soon shifted to an end berth and
is starting all of the games this year.

Four Dramas

Will be Given

National Players to Sponsor
O’Neill Production
This Year,

The program planned by the
Dramatic department for the coming
year, under the direction of Sara
Sherman Pryor, promises to be an
interesting and a varied one. Foul‘
and possibily nve big productions will
be worked out in addition to the
many one act plays that will be giv-
en in connection with the class work
of the elementary and advanced pro-
duction students.

The first large project was the
lighting and scenery for the Grinnell
historical pageant which was one
of the features of the Grinnell Dia-
mond Jubilee celebration in com-
memoration of the seventy-fifth ans
niversary of the founding of the city.
The scenic design was submitted by
Margaret Napier and was being car-
ried out by the production classes.
Marjorie Wilder had charge of the
work shop. William Pryor was at
the head of the lighting crew.

Chapter Sponsors Play

The Grlnnell chapter, Pi Epsilon
Delta, of the National Collegiate
,Players will sponsor a Eugene O'Neill
production, which will be either one
of his early .long plays, possibly
“.The Emperor Jones," or his cycle of
four sea plays.

The Experimental Theatre will as
usual encourage creative work of the
students. There is an unusually
large play-writing class this year
whose members will submit material
for thesteiner play contest. Two
bills of private tryouts will’ be given
before the contest in order to deter—
mine the plays to be submitted to
the judges. in addition to the Stein-
er prize for the best written play
and the prize for direction which was I
given last year, there will be prizes
ror scenic design; lighting, and.cos-
tomes.

The advanced production class will
put on two bills of one act sometime
during the first semester. Members
of the elementary class who are plan—
ning to put into practice what they
have learned, either in coaching or
producing. will be given an oppor-
tunity to direct a one act play before
they complete Lhe course. There are
over thirty students in his class and
about eight in the advanced class.

has been made yet.
