_ By John Canning, Jr.

Don Sarita, of the Sanitary Barn-
er Shoppe, has made an astonishing
revelation concerning the vice condi-
tions in Grinnell college. He stated,
in an exclusive interview with Doric,
that Bob DeLong, during the Harold

baccos . . . and all cigarette makers have used it
for years. But “heatrltreating” cannot take the
place of good tobacco in making a honey-

secret of OLD GOLD’S goodness

OLD GOLD tobaccos are naturally good. Care-
fully selected from Nature's best for smooth-
ness, ﬂavor and freedom from throat-scratch.

You have only to try a package to get the thrill of
this smoother and better cigarette. That will
tell you why DLD GOLD’S sales are ALREADY
