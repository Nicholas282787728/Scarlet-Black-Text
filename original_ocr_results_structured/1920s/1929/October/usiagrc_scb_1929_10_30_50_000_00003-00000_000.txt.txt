DORIC

The Column of Pure Brainy. ;

The Doric received a letter this
week from one of our sweet alumnae.
“Dear Doric.” the letter read. “Your
line sounds so much like that of the
boy who drove me to Merrill Bark
one night after dark.‘snd attempted
to kiss me. I wonder. perchance.
could you be the one?"

We disclaim all responsibility for
this event. when real men take
women to Merrill Park, the conquest
is made, not attempted.

The scene is laid at Madame La-
Cuta‘s. after the Grinneli (6), Drake
(6). game:

Nesbitt: (Slightly inebriated.
speaking to Ossie Snyder and Chet
Williams.) rm a terror. I am.

Snyder: Be ye?

Nesbitt: Takes three men to han-
dle me. » - ~ (Rising painfully from
the floor) 011, well.‘ I suppose two
can do it in a pinch.

Some of these Grl’hhell Sophisti~

cates are going to be liable to gov-
ernmental control. if they're not
more careful. Using the males to Lies
fraud, yoll know, is still against the
statutes of our fair land.

A campus repr entative of the
largest press association recently res
ceived this letter from the feature
editor at Chicago.

“There ought to be a snappy fear
tnre story and pictures on the meth-
‘ods used to safeguard co-ed morals
{both at Crinnell. where they have
'thc fence. and lewa City, where
PeepingsTom gongs have been in
stalled for late deters. The measures
smack. don‘t. they. of those taken by
ye olde knights when they left their
ladies fair to go to the wars. A fence
lpicture. including a ladder. a lad with
a fresh cap, and some pretty girls
with some handsome limbs would be
very acceptable."

All people desiring to volunteer for
places in the picture please send in
their names. and we’ll wire Chicago
for an armoredlphotogrophcr’s car.
