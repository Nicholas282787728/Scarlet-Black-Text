PBUDITIES IN RETRDSI’ECT

The curtain has iallen on the pirate maids, the pel'A
ioct'date, and all those variegated and fascinating acts
that made up the Pioneer Prudities or 1929, Now that
the second annual production or the Prudiues is past
history, we are more than ever convinced of their value.

Cooperation between cottages and buildings in this
year's production gave proof that Grinncll men and
women can get-together notwithstanding the dating
dilemma. In fact, the practices for the various acts
provided ample opportunity tor many people to strike
up new friendships and strengthen’ old ones, and the
dating situation hids {air to improve,

sum“, mean 9, 1929

 

The rivalry stirred up by the competition tor the
financial reward and social prestige accompanying the
Prudlties' victory was a triendly, healthy rivalry rather
than n bitter one, Having seen the products turned out
by the various cottage-building combinations, colioglans
are quite iair in admitting tho superiority of some, the
weaknesses oi others.

Talent. hitherto undiscovered, was brought to light
in the Pruditles, and abilities rarely displayed were
utilized tor mutual beneﬁt That elusive quality known
«as originally cropped out in many spots. Lines, music,
and movement were interesting # not unilormly new,
out sparkling here and there. Certain clever campus
hrainn had surely been working overtime:

And then, there's the matter of the judge. Now
that Harlan Miller is acquainted with the school, there's
no foretelllng what publicity Grinnell will get in “Over
the Cottee,"

NOTES 0!’ SPRING

Spring approaches. The season ui recitals liy jun-
ior and senior muslc students will be opened this week
with the concerts on Wednesday arid Friday evenings
in Herrick chapel.

It the tradition in regard to these recitals remains
unbroken, they will be attended only by a small group
of the periormers' intimate friends together with a few
members 0! the School of Music. The other residents
01 the campus will wend their respective ways, more or
less weariiy, in accustomed paths, oblivious to the really
this music being pruduced a few steps away,

It this tradition passes out, together with other time-
worn Grinneli customs now singing a swan chorus, many
students Will discover ’an added pleasure of spring-time.
l-‘or,asldcfromhenciits accruing to the performers and
to the School of Music lrom increased attendance at. the
student recitals, there Will come untold enjoyment to the
people who make up the audience. They will he surpris-
ed many times at the degree of proficiency which the
music students have no show (or their yours or practice
and study, here and elsewhere, They will find that the
remainder of their evening's work or recreation will run
more smoothly if it is preceded by the few minutes of
music and relaxation which a. brief concert affords. un-
less they are hardened disapprovers of everything musi-
cal, they will delight in the spring season of recimis.

MORE POLITICS

Grinnellians. who declared on March 4 that the in»
augural signelized the end of puliLical dissenslon, woke
up the next morning to find politics transferred to the
campus.

Many students have deplored the active campaigning
being instigated Lhis year for League Board elections.
But we believe that Lhe open and above-board politics
now being carried on is better than [he more subtle sort
of campaign that sometimes grips the campus voters.
Furthermore. this averred political aglmtlon signifies a.
healtjlly and widespread interset In the outcome of the

elections. Better campaign before than gripe after—
