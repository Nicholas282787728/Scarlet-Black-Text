T GEN R. l'l0\' on tutlh’xlim,
STI linxT,

Our appreciation or the Vesper Sel'\ice at Grinncli
has grown with our years of ahscucc

we wish to urge the present college generation to
take full advantage of the unique opportunity or expo?
iug themsclrcs to its intlucnce IL is our hope that the
hill consider this scrvicc a sacred trust. to be passed
to ruture college geiieraiions,‘ more hcautirul than when
it was passed on to them.

Grimlell .tlmimi of New Yolk, January 25, 1929.

TO THE PRES

The above appeal to the sllident llud)‘ at cimnrll
college should not go uuhccdcd. it is tho opinion or
those who have graduated from Grinncll in classes rang-
ing' ivom is to 1923. It is the statement or h group
composed of young and old, successful and mediocre. ii
is u wish, a hope, men a command. but most or oil, i
trust. It' is n sacred trust that we, the pr scut gene or
(ion or students. help It) pcrpetustc the institution at \ e.
poi-s, a service whose \'1\Iue_gi'm\'s with each passing
Year.

An appcal bllsetl on iiinturitr, experience, and kindli-
uess should not rail to hit its mark. Perhaps out of this
statement those who can stently attend Vespers may
reel encouraged and those who do not attend may rccl
stimulated.
