COAST CLOTHING 00.

COASTS’ OF IOWA CITY are one of the
outstanding college stores of the United States.

They have become so because they have,

studied what university men want. They are
in close alliance with Hart Schaffner & Marx,
whose style scouts are constantly studying the
trends at the great schools of the country.

Now we are bringing to Grinnell the results of
our own experience and that of the world’s
greatest clothing makers.

We are bringing adequate stocks—all the
new colors and patterns.

And we are bringing hats and furnishing goods
worthy to go with Hart Schaffner & Marx
clothes.

OPEN TODAY AT BROAD STREET AND
Fourth Avenue in the store formerly
occupied by McMurray Brothers.
