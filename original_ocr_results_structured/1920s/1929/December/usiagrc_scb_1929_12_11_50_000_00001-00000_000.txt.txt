For Small Cities Like Grinnell to Have

Concerts ‘15 Not So

By Sylvia Joseph,

 

“There is one thing I should say
about America: I do not understand,
but I like it, that the little cities like
this one have concerts. In Europe
it is not so”, remarked Nathan
Milstein, Russian violinist, speaking
of American music before the con-
cert last night. In a mixture of
French and English. the young musl-
cian gave his opinions on everything
from the Iowa climate to the modern
theater in Russia.

Indicating with an expressive gesV
ture the fog that overhung Grinnell.
he declared that the climate was ter-
rible, but that up to the present he
had enjoyed his American tour. “I
have been in Havana. in Florida, in
Canada, and in South America, and
if has been very interesting". he add-
ed.

Audiences Slime

“In America it is as in Europe:
there is a good public and a poor one
fit is like that in Paris or Berlin",
was Mr. Milstein’s comment on the
often repeated declaration that Am-
ericans do not appreciate good music.
”American orchestras are the best in
the world. I have played with most
of the big symphony orchestras.
those of Philadelphia, Los Angeles.
New York. and San Francisco, and I
like them. It is better to play with
orchestra, because there are some
pieces I can't play with only a piano."

Mr. Milstein was reluctant to dis-
cuss communist policies. When ask—
ed about the new Russian marriage
laws, he smiled and said, “I don’t like
to speak about it. lit is not,"~he
paused and searched for the.rlght
word, then ﬁnished, “not my busi-
ness." The government. he declared.

in Europe’—Milstein

does not make it difficult for non-

communlsts to ,:et along, but life is

very hard economically for everyone.
Revolution Terriblo

“During the revolution, I was in
Petrograd. Some of the things that
happened were terrible. Every re—
volution is disastrous at ﬁrst, but
the Russian government is like any
other. partly good and partly bad. It
has its own speciﬁc program, like
that of the Fascists in Italy. I have
been told in New York that there is
much factory construction on the
American model, much commerce,
but I myself have not been in Rus-
sia for four years."

Mr, Milstein knows both Vladimir
Horowitz and Gregor Piatigorsky
whom he considers as fine musicians.
He will be with Platlgorsky in Genoa
in February. He 'was surprised.
however. to hear that Horowitz had
played in Grinnell in November,

As to Russian music, Mr. Milstein
stated that many of the conductors
of orchestras are foreigners, largely
from France and Germany.

Theatre Is Experlmenhu

“The Russian theater is very ex-
perimemal now. I have seen both
French and German productions,
but I think the Russian are very
good. The revolution formed a new
type, classicism, but with the subs
jects drawn from the revolution.
There is more action. more move-
ment, with fewer words. Meier-
cbold is one of the greatest users of
the new form."

The young Russian spoke with en-
thusiasm of his violin, a Guaranerius
del Jesu. He was interested in the
accoustics and seating capacity of
the Grinnell chapel which he called
the “salle de concert."

Sara Sherman Pryor. director of
both plays. says “This is the largest
and most difficult production ever
attempted by the Grinnell experi-
mental theatre."

“Suppressed Desires" will be pre-
sented first as a curtain raiser. This
is considered the funniest one act
comedy written by an American
author and has for its theme, psy-
