TEN O‘CLOCK CHAPEL,

The temporary return to the
old’ chapel system for the senior
services Friday added a practical
to those theoretical
propositions advanced
the eight o’clock chapel. The rcr
turn to the old time was made at
the request of the senior class
which felt that mid-morning
would prove more convenient for

argunellt
against

 

organization preparatory to
marching in. Ill granting the re
quest the administration admit-
ted the validity of the claim.

Admitting, than, the greater
convenience of the old chapel for
senior sci-vices and other occa-
sions of like, nature, it would seem
that the plan of shifting chapels
from eight o'clock to tell o’clock
would have to he followed
throughout next year should the
early morning services continue.
This would cause much confusion
and prevent tllc morning sched-
ule from settling down to a
smoothly working. machine-like
l-outillc.

Another consideration which
might be regarded as theoretical
only because it has not had to be
faced yet is the convenience of
visiting speakers. It is probable
that some speakers might. not ar-
rive in Grinnell by all earlier
train than the nine o’clock ones.
Even in case of those who had arr
rived the evening before, it would
seem more courteous to allow
them a decent night’s sleep and
a leisurely breakfast rather than
expect them to rise with the
farmers, factory hands, faculty
and those few Grinncll students
with purposes in life. To com-
pel them to hake a speech would
be bad enough. But to compel
them in make a speech at eight
o'clock ill the morning—shades
of a Big Ben alarm clock.

In all fairness it should be said
that the attendance in eight
o’clock chapel has, contrary to
our prediction ill a previous edi-
torial. remained surprisingly
close to average. Should this cone
llition continue it would spoil a
very strong argument of the anti»

TO DO A JOB WELL.

At this time of the year, it is
particularly satisfying to stop and
count the jobs that you have dollc
well. It is arbitrarily set aside as
a turning point in our college life.
In the closing of our accounts,
ﬁnal examinations arc taken as a
closing inventory,

It is necessary to include in this
job the balancing of all ﬁnancial
obligations, It is also ﬁtting that
we lay plans for the future. Work
this summer and save your money
to have it when you come back
next fall. You will get more for
your dollar.

Theodore Rooscvelt said: “In
unending strife for civic heter-
nlcnt small small is the use of
those pcople who mean well, but
who mean well fecbly.”

So, do your job well.

Campus Opinion

Question: “Do you favor the change
in chapel hour made three weeks
ago?"

Merton Knapp: Personally I enjoy
(in early spring morning chapel ser-
Vice. However, I would like to see the
tl’ad' 'on as regards chapel seating
maintained.

Hillel Denny: Yes, I do. I think the
ten o'colck chapel breaks into the day
too much. Those interested in chapel
go at eight just as at ten. Going to

 

chapel is a good way for students to
start out the day.

.lonhthnu Bunionll: There is a
freshness, spontaneity, and enthus-
iasm generated in the eight o'clock
chapel which innoculates the parli»
cipatnrs with a vigorous attitude to
commence the day's labor. Everyone's
wit is at the pinnacle at attention at
that time and not languid as it would
be in the middle of the morning.
Chapel is the expression of Grinnell's
religious attitude. Therefore, this
warrants chapel being placed where
the greatest value and attention is se-
cured from it,

Alice Totem-h: Yes, 1 do. Eight
o'clock chapel gives one longer time
to sleep.

ltollprt Syl-llt: No. Four classes in a
line with no intermission is too much.
Besides, though the services have
greatly improved, the attendance
doesn't show any improvement.

)lhry hleaunr H031: Eight o'clock
chapel makes the day go faster. It is
hard, however, to sit through four
classes in the morning. 1 dop't think
attendance at the eight o'clock chapel

Civil \Var song medley. This was fol»

Don lloull . I think eight o'clock
chapel is a good thing. Next year

chapel.

ltarrirl Stephens: I haven't def-
initelv decided whether 1 do or not,

V l iluu Pryor: I can't see that the
change to eight o'clock chapel has
made any difference.

Xellie ill-mm: I prefer the eight
o‘clock chapel hour. I think those
that go at this time go because they
enjoy chapel. It gives chapel a (lit?
fcrent atmosphere.
