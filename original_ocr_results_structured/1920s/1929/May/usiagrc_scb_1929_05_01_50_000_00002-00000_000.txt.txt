Thro l7huut the colleges and
univcrs s of the count “ there
has been great agitation concern-
ing student government. Plan af-
ter plan has been introduced to
insure some sort of representative
government by students. and plan
after plan has failed. In some col;
leges, student government has
been done away with completely;
in others. a weak governing body
has held office in name: but not
in fact. In a very few the fact that
students are not able to govern
themselves unassisted has been
recognized and co-operat

Cuts and the Student
‘ A previous article attempted
to show how the cut system hine
Clered the instructor, This cdi»
torial will deal with the student’s
side of the matter. We believe
that the out system handicaps the
undergraduate by obscuring for
him the main issue of the college
bargain which is whether he cares
to Claim the services for which
he pays 250 dollars per year in
tuition. This question uncamou-
flaged should bring but one an-
swer. After all. there are not
many people like the two farmers
in an old song which, as nearly
as we can recall, ran like this7
“-Si and I Went to the circus

People like to get value receiv-

enforcement of cut-recording has
not prevented cases like this. And
when methods are found to come
bat these practices, it is probable
that undergraduate ingenuity will
apply itself to inventing other (lee
vices for “In ways that are dark
and tricks that are vain,” the av
erage Grinnellian like Bret
Harte 's Hheathen chinec,” “is
peculiar.” At least, as far as evad.
ing cuts is concerned.

ELECTRICITY;

 

 

 

 

the modem prospector

STOUT heart; a burn) laden with pick, shovel,
and the bare necessities of life; and the pros-
pector was ready for the gold rush—Sutter's Mill,
the Pike‘s Peak country, Cripple Creek, Klondyke.
A scattered trail of half-worked claims marked
his sacriﬁces. .

To-day mining is a business, with electricity
replacing wasteful brawn in mine and mill.

The deep mine, with electric lights, hoists, and
locomotives; the surface mine with huge electric
shovels scooping up tons of are in a single bite;
the concentrating mill with its batteries of elec-
trically driven machines; thc steel mill with its con-
stant electric heat‘here are but: a few ,of elec-
tricity‘s contributions to the mineral industries.

So in every industry, electricity increases produc-
tion and cuts costs. It is the modem prospector,
leading the way into wider ﬁelds and tapping
undeveloped resources—that: we may enjoy a ﬁner
civilization and a richer, fuller life.

You will ﬁnd this mono.’
gram on powerful motors
that drive heavy mil-ling
machinery and on tiny
motors that drive sewing
machines. Both in industry
and in the home it is the
mark of an organization
that is dedicated to elec-
trical progrcss.
