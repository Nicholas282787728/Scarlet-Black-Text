Squad Points

for Creighton
Tilt Thursday

Pioneers Doped to Win Last
Game of Season by
Easy Margin.

Workouts Are Light

Cold Weather Is Responsible For
Motley Costumes Which
Appear on Field.

Light workouts have been the
rule with the varsity football squad
this week in preparation for its coir
test with Creighton at Omaha next
Thursday.The Turkey day game will
close the Pioneer season, which from
all appearances will be one of the
most outstanding successes of the
record books. Not only are the
Scarlet and Black warriors doped to
go through the season with a clean
Missouri valley slate, but to date
they have lost only one game — the
Ames contest early in the year.‘

The extreme cold has’ been re-
sponsible for a rather motley 3p»
pearing gridiron outfit out for prac-
tice, Russell Buff taking the prize
for warming devices with a scarlet
stocking cap. Stocking cap or not,
however, Ruff goes through with his
daily schedule of passing, straight to
the arms of his eligible men. Coach
Watt is taking no chance of injuring
any of his squad before the final
game of the year and his scrimmages
have only been short and snappy af-
fairs.

Bluejays Won Four Games '

The. team will be battling at
Creighton, not only to hold to its re-
cord of this season, but partially to
vindicate the Pioneer teams for de-
feats in the past. In the four games
with the Bluejays, the Pioneers have
lost only four. To make it clearer,
they have not won any.

A bitter feeling toward the Blue-
jays might be just a bit justiﬁed, to.
two of those defeats meted out to
Grinnellians were by one point mar-
gins. In 1398 Creighton won 8 to 7
and in 1923 they shut the Pioneers
out with a 14 to 0 score. 1n 1924 the
gridmen from Omaha chalked up a
13 to o victory.

Last: Year's Game Close

The game last year was as thrill-
ing as any in the midwest, but it end-
ed the wrong way from the Grinnell
point of view. Creighton won, 20 to
19. ,The outfit from Nebraska took
an early lead when the Pioneers
fumbled on the second play of the
game, and scored two touchdowns
before the close of the half. In the
third quarter, however, Ruff's trusty
passing arm canie into play and the
score changed from 13 to o to 19 to
13 for Crinnell, With victory in its
grasp, the Pioneers eleven could not
withstand the fourth quarter charges
of the Bluejays and another touch-
down brought the visitors a 20 to 19
margin.

Creighton has showed power in
only one contest this year, that be

Merrill Debate
Finals Will Be
After Vacation

The final round of the 19th annual
Merrill Debate in Practical Politics,
under the auspices of the Grinnell
forensic, will be held soon after
Thanksgiving, and in all probability
will take place in Herrick chapel.
John Snoddy and Rudolph Schlank,
debating for Kelly Stables, will have
as their opponents Art de Persia and
Al Johnson representing Clark hall.
The Clark hall team defeated Build
ing Four in the semi—finals. and Kel-
ley stables drew a bye, ,

receive a $20 cash prize, and the
winning building represented has
the choice of an engraved plaque or
a cup, Last year Clark hall won the
final round from Building Three.

Since 1925 the Merrill debate has
been run as an intramural affair,

ed. Clark hall has won the honor
once, and Building Four twice.

Judges and the chairman of the
contest have not as yet been chosen.
The question for debate ‘remains the
same: “Resolved: That the Italian
Dictatorship is Justiﬂable.”

Freshmen Face

LS. T. C. Today

While Not Content With
Team, Truesdale Looks
For Good Game.

After a week of strenuous work-
outs, Coach J. C. Truesdale dismiss-
ed his freshmen gridmen last night
after a short signal drill in shape to
meet the State Teachers college rea
serves here this afternoon. Although
not satisfied with the showing made
by the yearlings, Coach Truesdale
promised that they would show the
visitors a real scrap.

The team will be in better shap-
than it was for the Drake contest
Nov. 8, but will be missing the work

a game leg.

From Cedar Falls comes the re-
port that several of the best players
of the reserve team will be unable to
play today because of injuries. Cole,
a guard, with an ankle injury, Good-
en, Schlammel, heavy full back,‘and
Lynch. halfback. will probably not be
able to play in the 'game.

GRINNELL, IOWA,

Grinnell College will be host to the
coaches and athletic heads of the
schools of the Missouri valley con-
ference when that body meets here
December 6th. Probably the most
important thing to be discussed will
be the freshmen athletic rules.
These rules have caused some trouble
for quite a while, and are up for
ﬁnal settlement this year. At this
time also the coaches will be filling
out football schedules for the com-
ing year. At present, Grinnell has
one game scheduled, that with Drake

there is another important meeting
in Chicago that many of the coaches
wish to attend.

1f the coaches, athletic heads and
faculty advisers pursue the same
course as at the meeting last year
at Des Doimes, they will also award
the indoor track meet to one of the
conference schools, as Well as the
outdoor meet, besides setting the
dates for both of these events. Other
athletic events whose location for
this year will probably be determin-
ed include the swimming meet and
a baseball tournament,

 

Taft Concludes

Lecture Series

‘Michel Angelo’ ls Subject of
Final Talk in Chapel
Wednesday.

“Michel Angelo is a hewer of
stone with something to say," said
Lorado Taft in his lecture in Herrick
chapel Wednesday evening. This
lecture concludes the series of ﬁve
lectures which he presented on an-
«cient art. ”Michel Angelo" was the
subject of this talk.

Mr. Taft began his lecture by read-
ing some facts of the life and char-
acter of “the crowning ﬁgure of the
Renaissance," Michel Angelo.

“Michel Angelo is the greatest arte
istic person of whom we have de-
finite knowledge,” said Mr. Taft.
When Michel Angelo was a boy, he
may have shaped his career by ob-
serving the forms in the stoneyard,
Mr. Taft believes. His first work
was done in a Gothic church in Flor-
ence, where he helped to mix colors
to decorate the choir. He next
worked in the public gardens of
Lorenzo De Medici, The De Medici
always had a great inﬂuence on the
artist.

“Michel Angelo was twenty-one
when he first went to Rome,” re-
marked Mr. Taft, Rome lured ev-
eryone at that time. although it is
not as artistic as the Florence which
he left, In 1501, when he retained
to Florence, he was greeted as a
famous man.

"Pope Julius II wanted a great
,tomh built for himself. Michel
Angelo was appointed to do this
work. The tomb was designed, stone
and materials were brought. a great
start was made on it, when the Pope
suddenly decided that he didn't wish
the tomb, This unfinished tomb'was
the tragedy of Michel Angelo's life.

“But. the Pope was wiser than he
knew in compelling Michel Angelo to
create a masterpiece in another ﬁeld.
He had Michel Angelo cover the ceil-
ing of the Sistine chapel with fresco.”

“Michel Angelo had an advantage
over art of today, ”Mr. Taft remark»
ed. “The controlling elements of so
ciety were more interested in art
than they have been at any time
since. He was able to stand on the
shoulders of those who had gone be-
fore hirn, acquiring certain technique
and accumulation of knowledge from
the past.”

NO PAPER ‘VEDNESDAY.
The Scarlet and Black Will not be
published Wednesday because of mid
semester exams.

Osgood to Talk

on Abyssinia

Noted Explorer Will Tell on
December 3 of His

Experiences.

The mysterious and little-known
country of Abyssinia will be describe
ed here on the evening of December
3 by Dr. Wilfred H. Osgood, noted
scientiﬁc explorer. it was announced
today by Prof. Edward B. '1‘. Spencer.
chairman of the Grinnell college lec~
turn course committee. Dr. Osgood’s
lecture. which will be held in the col-
lege chapel, will be illustrated with
motion pictures and colored slides.

Dr. Osgood was the directing head
of the recent Field Museum-Chicago
Daily News expedition which never
scd the heart of wildest Abyssinia in
a 2,000-mile caravan jaunt. In his
lecture here on “Mysterious Abys-
sinia and the Source of the Blue
Nile,” he will tell of villages built in
the Sixteentlrcentury feudal style,
of women and girls who are little
more than domestic slaves. of fan-
atic priests, and of warlike tribes in
which a man's ability is judged by
his skill in killing human beings.

Has Pictorial Record

In the expedition to Abyssinia, Dr.
Osgood's experiences ranged from
encounters with wild tribes and
bandits who had never before seen
.white men, to magniﬁcent rcceptions
by provincial potentates. An ex-
cellent pictorial record of the entire
expedition was made, visualizing not
only the rare and little—known ani»
male and birds of the country, but
the quaint customs of this primitive
people as well.

The expedition of 1925727 collected
many interesting animals for the
Field museum, of which Mr. Osgood
has been curator of zoology for many
years, These specimens included the
beautiful mountain nyala or “Queen
of Sheba-s antelope," the Abyssinian
ibex, the gelada baboon, and other
animals conﬁned to the highlands of
Abyssinia, which constitutes the
largest mountainous area in all
Africa.

Macy Expeditions

Mr. Osgood has also been a mem-
ber of expeditions to Alaska, Canada,
and various parts of’ the United
States and South America. He has
spent two years in studying in Eu-
ropean museums. In 1914, he was a
member of the commission to investi-
gate tlie fur seal industry.

Dr. Osgood holds his bachelor's de-
gree from Leland Stanford univer-
_sity and his doctors in zoology from
Chicago.

Pianist Opens
Recital Series
Tuesday Night

Horowitz, Youthful Russian
Pianist, Is Recognized
as Great Artist.

Has Varied Program

Will Have Opportunity to Exhibit
Recognized Versatiliity Here;
Interprets Chopin.

Vladimir Horowitz, whose recital
here Tuesday evening at eight o‘«
clock in Herrick chapel will open the
concert series of the School of Music,
has played as soloist with symphony
orchestras all over the United Stat
es and has also given many individu-
al concerts of the kind he will give
in Grinnell. In Chicago last year he
first played with the Chicago Syn-i-
series of recitals.

In commenting on his first Chicago
recital, the music critic of The Chi—
cago Tribune said: “Many a pianist
has been a hit as an orchestral solo-
ist and something of a disappoint-
ment in a later recital, but Mr. Horo—
witz has now proved that he is the
great, the only great, musical sensa-
tion of the last ten years in either
capacity. When he got into ‘his
Chopin, the pair of mazurkas and
the trio of etudes, he laid aside for
the tlme being the grand manner of
concerto and sonata and showed that
dance and song are as close to his
soul as the most stupendous sonori-
ties, the most complex thoughts ever
wrought on the keyboard."

Horowitz-s program here will in-
clude two mazurkas and the Etude
in F major of Chopin, His inter-
pretation of Chopin has won praise
from critics all over the country.

The personality of the young Bus-
slan has drawn attention wherever
he has played. His youth, his ab-
sorption in his music, the individu-
ality of his interpretation of composi-
tions that have been played again
and again, all have helped to create
enthusiastic audiences in Europe and
in this country. The personality ot
Horowitz has had ’much to do with
the fact that concert halls are almost
invariably sold» out for his recitals.

The program for Tuesday evening
is:

Orga’n Prelude and Fugue in D
