FOR READING, ‘VE SUGGEST —

In his Armistice Day chapel speech, Professor
Gsnnaway stated a truth which the majority of thinks
ing people today agree with, namely that the “supreme
problem before mankind is the problem 7 ~ - of the
organize/tion of the World for peace.” How Soon this
problem will be solved is largely dependent on the
attitude of the press. If the American people, to take
an important part of the world, and college students, as
an important part of the American people find in the
majority of their newspapers little news regarding
foreign affairs, and that which is published, biased
against foreign countries, if they read in the editorial
columns of their papers a continuous discrediting of
other nations and exaltihg of America as an example
of unselfishness and purity, they cannot be expected
to.favor a League of Nations, a World Court, or the

reduction of armaments. If, on the other hand, the
papers they read are warmly in favor of America's
entrance into foreign affairs, then in a short time the

dominant phychology will no longer he that of isola-‘

tion.
At present, the trouble is that those papers in the
last mentioned class are neither in the majority nor rlo
they have the circulation nor employ flaming heads
lines to attract attention. But they exist. At Grim

‘ncll, where the average student heads in a bee-line

for the Chicago Tribune comic strips, and then scans
the remainder of a paper whose reactionary policies
are well-known, there is also available the Christian
Science Monitor, and if the Monitor doesn't have comic
strips, it has an international viewpoint both in its
news and editorial columns that makes it well worth
the attention of thc Grinnell student who cares about
the prohlem Mr. Gannaway stressed last Monday.

For example, the Monitor of last Wednesday con—
tained on the front page . distinct and important
stories from foreign countries, a perusal of which
gave one a tlefinite feeling of friendliness to foreign
nations. Contrast with this the policy of the Tribune.
An example may be cited. Two years ago during
the Geneva Arms conference, Lord Bridgeman, head of
the British delegation, stated that he ”had not disput-
ed and did not intend to dispute the claim of the
United States to equality in naval strength." The
Tribune distorted his statement, lto their American
piihlic, to: “Bridgman says he will never agree to
naval parity.”

Again, contrast the treatment givenhy the two
papers to Hoover's Armistlc Day speech. Everyone
who has read it knows that the President favors reduc—
tion of naval armament in proportion as low as the
other powers are willing to go and that he discussed
means toward bringing such reduction ahout. His note
was fundamentally that of peace Said the Monitor
editorially, ”Confronted with a world-wide evil, he
spends little time in deploring it, but sets himself to
discover some method for its correction.” Said the
Tribune editorially, “The President reiterated his pos-
ition in favor of adequate national defense, remind-
ing his countrymen that not a single quarter of a cenr
tury during all the ages of human experience war-
rants thc assumption that war will not occur again."
The Tribune missed the point entirely, It would!

If studentsiaud facultyimust read the Tribune's
comic strips and sports pages, well, let them continue.
We do the same thing. But after the comics and
sports have been consumed and they desire a little
constructive reading of the day’s events, may we sug
gest such a newspaper as the Monitor? Only by culti-
vating such newspapers, will the American people, of
which Grinnell college students are a part, ever get
the right perspective on international affairs. Only thing
will this country become educated to do its part in the

organization of the world for peace.

Hoover, Senate May
Clash, Says Ingham

(Continued From Page 1)

from breaking into flames of wa ‘I
shouldn’t be surprised to see it come
in France, to see a reaction to mon-
archy in Germany, or to see the
trouble start in Russia. You can’t
tell what will happen in Russi , but
if they are let alone they are going
to leak out for their own interest
and so are all the other nations. It
is hard to predict what will happen,
but it is going to blow somewhere.

“If the United States and Great
Britain would agree that their navies
would not he used for Wal‘ and that
they would protect the interests of
France that nation might give up
submarines."

Mr. Ingham agreed that at: pres—
ent the entire international situation
appeared to hinge on the activities
of the United States and Great Brit»
sin. Thus it would seem that they
can make or mar world peace by
their decision as to Whether or not
they Will co~operate with each other.

“Mr. Hoover is sincerely doing all
he can to forward the cause of World
peace, but the party has been divided
on the tariff issue and any move that .
he makes in the direction of a World
Court or League agreement will prob» ,
ably be violently contested by the
senate faction led by Johnson, and
it is just: a. question of how much a
President can do,” Mr, Ingham Corl-
eluded,

Editor, Scarlet and Black:-

Mr. Mount's interesting essay up
on the theory of cmployership and
the general trend of the cotton mill
industry aroused in us a desire to
know its application to the present
situation,

GMAJs editorial gave facts con—
eel-hing conditions and incidents at
the Loray mill in Gastonia, and at
the R. W. Baldwin mill in Marion, in
1928 and 1929. We would like to
have Mr. Mom-it’s statements related
to these mills, For instance, are the
R. W. Baldwin and Lorary mills
among the seventeen companies
which showed net losses in 1923? If
not, what are the conditions of the
employees in these seventeen, com-
pared to the Baldwin and Loray
mills?

Respectfully,
Rebecca Conard.

‘Eclitorial Problems
Differ’—Gannaway

“The editorial page is not the place
for the display of mere smartncss
and cleverness," Professor John W.
Gannaway, head of the political
science department at Grinnell and
former editorial writer for the Mile
waulree Journal, told the editorial
writers of high school papers in an
address to them in the A. R. H. audi»
torium this morning at 9:30.

“The problems of the editorial
page in the high school, in the Cole
logo, and in the general newspapers
are not quite the same, and yet some
things can he said about the editor-
ial page which will be just as true
of one as of the other,” Mr. Gann-
way began and then plunged direct-
ly into the heart of his speech.

“To me the editorial page is the
most important part of the newspa»
per both from the standpoint of the
editor and from the standpoint of
the public. It seems to me that no
one can loolr at the editorial page
without realizing what a tremendous
force the editor exerts in the forma-
tion of public opining. Democrary is
impossible without good public opin—
ion.”
