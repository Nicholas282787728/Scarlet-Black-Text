SATURDAY. )LAY 18, 1929.

New YorkiTinted motion picture
films, with red ior tire scenes, blue
for night scenes, green for forest
scenes or yellow where artiiicial light
is represented, will now return to the
theaters, from which they were forced
for technical reasons with the advent
of the talkies.

This is made possible with a new
series or ﬁlms announced this morn-
ing at the meeting ot the Society oi
Motion Picture Engineers at the Bell
Telephone Laboratories here. Dr. L.
A. Jones, head or the physics depart.»
ment of the Eastman Kodak Labor--
atories, under whose direction the
tinted mm was developed, described
their advantages.

Beiore the days of the talkies. the
tamiliar tinted stock was turnished by
the various firm manutactures. This
was like the ordinary positive film
on which the pictures were printed,
except that in its manufacture a dye
had been incorporated into the cel-
luloid base.

llost oi the sound or talking movies
today are produced with the sound
record on a strip alongside the intlivA
idual picture irames which carry the
visual record. This strip varies in
transparency. A beam nf light passes
through it as it runs through the
projector, and thence to a phot elec-
tric cell, which converts the variations
or light into vibrations in electric
current. This current is amplified,
and operates loud speakers, where it
it converted to sound.

Just as photographic plates are
very sensitive to blue or violet light,
and very insensitive to red light, for
which reason a red light is used in
their development, the photo-electric
cell is also most sensitive to blue-vioe
let light, Thus, when red tinted film
was used, the color of the iilm pre-
vented the light getting through to
the cell. Yellow stock though it did
not absorb as much or the active light
rays, also absorbed some [if them, and
even the blue iilm was not exactly
the right color tor the moxirnum sen-
sitivity. .

Sixteen separate tints have now
been developed, running the entire
range or the spectrum. A sevens
tenth is without color, but imparts
a. silvery hue to the,picture, The pe-
culiar thing about these new colors,
however, is that while they appear
blue, green, yellow, etc, to the eye,
each or them contains some blneevia-
it as well, and so transmits the color
required for the photoelectric cell.
Doctor Jones demonstrated this by
the sliver-imposing of the film of the
difterent tints on each other in piles
of six or eight, No matter what com-
binations were used, bluervioletlighl.
penetrated in every case, showing
that they were all transparent to this
colors.

According to Doctor Jones, the use
or these tints will aid the movies in
arousing the desired emotional moods
oi the audience, With the use or
tints the actual lighting at outdoor or
indoor scenes can he stimulated, and
there is added realism, even though
the color is a solid one over all parts
ot the picture, and not true color
photography, where each object has
its proper color. The person seeing
such a tint tends to associate it with
one of the main parts or the picture.
Thus green, tor a iorest scene sues
gests young toliage, grass. gardens.
etc, but it may also be used in quite
dittereut scenes to suggest the tresh-
ness of youth, stated the speaker.

Orators Entertain

The Men's Forensic society held
its annual tormal dinner dance last

Richard Phillips ”To Thoughts or."

The music was turnished by a trio
consisting of Charles Demug, Frank
Furbrush, and Rex Lyons. Ernest
McIntyre gave a few vocal selections.

Fail’s 1-“ g it Felltuire

In Thursday contest Grinnell's
ﬁrst baseman, Fail, was chiefly re
sponsible for the six Grinhell runs
with tour hits in {our times at loot,
three of (he swats going for doubles.
Gl’innell had the score tied and the
game might have gone into extra in»
ning but for some rather bad breaks
in the final session. With two men
dawn in the final canto, a. pair of er
rors resulted in the winning run for
the Bulldogs.

Other than Fall's hitting the big
feature at the contest for the Pin-
neel's was the Work of Brown at Sec

credited with five sparkling assists
and was also responsible for driving
home two runs.
