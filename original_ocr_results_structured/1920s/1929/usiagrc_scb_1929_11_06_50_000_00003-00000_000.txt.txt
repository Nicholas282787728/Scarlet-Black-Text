GAME OFFICIALS
TAKE KLINEFELTER
FOR ‘NO FISHING'

Klinefelter, who with Parish and
Davis invaded the unhappy Hunting
ground last week, ran into bad luck
and came home minus ten dollars,
which now reposes in the pocket of
an infamous game ,warden. Kline-
felter did not bag more than his
share of pheasants, nay nay. He was
fined for illegal fishing. He and Far-
ish were arguing concerning the
merits of their respective guns,
when Klinefelter fell into a creek.
When he climbed out he was met by
a game warden, who said in a stern
voice, "You're under arrest."

“For what?” shouted Paul.

“For illegal fishing. Don't you see
that sign on the bank?

"I haven-t been fishing. rm hunt—
nag."

“What’s that hanging to the tail
of your shirt then?” asked the law.
And sure enough,'there was a big
catfish hanging to Klinefelter's shirt.
and he had to pay his fine, or stay
in northern Iowa for ten days.

goodness, and are largely responsible

Downtown cafes have been doing is
rushing business these past few
weeks. It seems that even girls have
to eat something to keep alive.

The following testimonial comes
from Hattie Dlnswoody, Poughkeep-
sie, N. Y. “I reached for the Doric
and selected it from four of the worst
humor columns of the country. I
wasn't blindfolded, and hope you
choke."

All freshmen who feel that they
ought to he shot will see the younger
member or the Gleysteen tribe who
can probably find a Cottage III
transfer to arrange the details of the
procedure.

resulted from a. pair of line drives
and two successful passes.
Injured Men In Uniform

The varsity men didn’t go so well
Tuesday night, when they Scrim-
maged the second string eleven. Linc
drives gained consistently, but pass-
es were not often completed and
there were few long runs. Possibly
the fact that Ruff, Rose and Liedtke
were with the defensive eleven play-
ed a part in this performance. The
passing game went a bit better after
Ruff was shifted to the offensive
squad.

Humphrey reported for practice
Monday and Thomas was in uniform
again Tuesday afternoon. Both of
these men have been laid up with
injuries received against Drake.
Neither has taken part in scrimmage
as yet. however, and Heldridge is
also resting on the bench until he
rounds into shape.

Rose May Not store

Capt. Rose has not completely re-
covered from his injuries received
early in the season, and may not
start the game Friday. He is in
shape to play if needed, however. Mc-
lntire is ready to meet the toughest
of the lot and Richey is taking ac-
tive part in play again.

The football men are more com
ﬁdent of victory Friday than ls the
mentor. He recalls last year’s o to
0 tie and will be satisﬁed with no-
thing less that a decisive victory this
season. The Teachers have also had
two weeks of rest and are priming
for the contest Friday as one of
their big games. If they can trim
Grinnell, undefeated in the Missouri
Valley Conference. it will mean a big
step toward recognition.

Conch Watt has not yet announced
his starting lineup for Friday's con-
test.

was ushered in on Monday, and
many a junior and senior glanced en-
viously toward unsophisticated
sophomore tables were practical
measures still prevailed. It is some-
what a pity that the change was so
clearly defined and came at this time
of year. Table personnel had just
reached a stage of rigidity, and each
table had learned the divers abilities
and propensities of its members.
With the wholesale revision of table
seating, each table must learn once
more who drinks all the cream and
who swipes half the butter, and des
vise methods of boycott or restraint.
We pause here for a moment to con-
sider with awe the complications
that might arise should seven youths
of the capacity of the tall, handsome
led called "Lilacs" chance to be
seated at one table.

Despite its handicaps, the

sophomores are glad to be free from
the horesome prigs, and die frosh are
alone to perpetrate their crudities
without rebuke. Gone forever from
the dining hall are the peals of
hearty. raucous laughter, the pic-
turesque table nomenclature, the
hefty pounding upon the tables, and
the soft swish of carefully directed
butter finding its mark. Delicecy

and restraint reign supreme. The
waiters, especially, exercise the lat
ter. Everyone,seems satisfied that
the dormitory dining room has at _
last been civilized, and it is rumored

that the head waiters will appear one
of these days in dress suits. Chorus
singing is becoming fashionable,
and the formerly omnivorous youths
now leave untouched their desserts
in order to burst into song. It is
hopeo that the refining sentiment

ultimately spreads to the waiters and
that some day they will stop spilling
the gravy down unprotected necks.
