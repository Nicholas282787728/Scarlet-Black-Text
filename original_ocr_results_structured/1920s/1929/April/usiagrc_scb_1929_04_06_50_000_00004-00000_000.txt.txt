TO BE CHIC

ONE must have a pair or

patent leather or red kid
mules from ALMY'S. They're
just in, D'Orsay Slippers at
$3.50 a pair. Cheap enough
for good mules, say We all.
What could be swankier than
black pajamas and patent
leather shoes to match, or
perhaps gold anuxed P. .135
with red mules? I’m telling
you they‘re just plenty cute.
Look and see.

three panel heel. They're

darn cute, I’m telling you.
