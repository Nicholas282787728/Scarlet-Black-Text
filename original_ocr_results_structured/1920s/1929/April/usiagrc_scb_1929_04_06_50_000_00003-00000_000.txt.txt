Taylor Classiﬁed. As SOpliomore;
Seniors Boast Men Capable
of Placing High.

The sophomore track men or Grin-
nell college, already boasting or one
or the strongest class teams in the
race tor honors in the home meet,
April 13, have been virtually assured
at top honors with the announcement
by Coach Lester Duke that Warner
Taylor, crack hurdlcr, relay man
and broad juniper is oriicially classie
tied as a sophomore and uill run with
that class. lvith Een Hensley, Laur-
ence lliner, Ben Douglas, all regulars
of this year's track squad in the
competition it appears that the sec-
ond year men will have things their
own way. Joe McKee, Art Rlssel',
and George llccully, will bolster the
senior hopes, however, and may push
the sophomores.

Kansas nclays Next,

Tlle Orinnell track has been put in
shape tor the season and a new vault-
ing pit has been constructed so that
yaulters will not be compelled to go
against the wind at any time.

Following the home meet the tirst
Pioneer competition will be at the
Kansas relays, April 20 where Grinnell
will be represented by its undeteated
mile relay team composed or laur-
ence Miner, Bob Mark, Warner Tay-
lor and Joe hchee, Mark, Taylor and
lIcKee are veterans or the 1325 onit
who stepped the distance in 3:25 and
the addition or Miller speeds the squad
up. There is a possibility that Dyro
Pelletier. may yet nab a berth with
the quartet, also.

Although Coach Duke is not tak-.
ing many men to Kansas he will take
a large squad to the Drake meet.
