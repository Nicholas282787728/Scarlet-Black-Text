Personnel Bureau Professor Will Give
Full Time to Placing Local Students

In an endeavor to assist students
to adjust themselves while in college
and to aid them in choosing an occu-
pation and launching forth into it. a
new Student Personnel bureau has
recently opened its doors on the
Grinnell college campus. This bureau
under the direction of Prof. Mitchell
Dreese. a new faculty member who
will devote full time to personnel. is
located on the second floor of chi-
cago hall.

“The main purpose of this office
will be placed upon vocational guid-
ance and placement." Mr. Dreese
said. “I suggest." he continued.
“that students drop in quite early in
the year and become acquainted with
the director thus making it possible
for him to be of greater service to
them. I particularly would like to
have the seniors make an early conv
tact with this office."
Grinnell Among Leaders

ML Dreese brings with him to
Grinnell one of the newest move-
ments in modern education—person—
nel. During the last forty years and
more especially since 1910 new ways
of measuring human ability have
been devised and their correlations
studied. but it is just within the last
few years that an attempt has been
made to measure the individual abﬂa
ities and capacities of the college
student. Grinnell is among the first
colleges in the country to have a
trained personnel director giving full
time to this work. ‘Few of the
leading universities and col-
leges in the country have such
a department; outstanding among
them are University of Chicago.
Dartmouth College. ARIES, Univer-
sity of Michigan. Northwestern.
Oberlin, Princeton. Vassar, Welles-
ley. Yale. and University of Wiscon-
sin.

"A centralized record system for
all students in the college is being
installed,” Mr. Dresse stated. “Inc
formation of all kinds will come to
this office and will he organized here
in such a way that it_ will he of value
in giving counsel and vocational
guidance to students."

Orientation For Preps

"This first semester." Mr. Dreese
chntinued." I will direct a two point
orientation course which will be re-
quired of all freshmen. This course
will serve to acquaint the new Stu»
dents with all activities on the cam»
pus and to give them some contact
with the major departments in the
college." In the second semester I
expect to teach a two-hour elective
course which will be called "How to
Choose an Occupation.”

In connection with the work of-the
bureau there will be a section of
books concerning guidance and cow»
pations placed in the Library so that
students may investigate a line of

Ford Purchases
Rocket Replica
for His Museum

(Science Service)

DetroiL.—One of the newest pro-
ducts of British locomotive makers
has now arrived in this country.
where it will he placed on permanent
exhibit at the Ford museum. It is
not distinguished for its beautiful
appearance, for its power or speed.
since this locomotive is an exact rep-
lica of the Rocket. built in 1329 by
George Stephenson. It won a prize
of 500 pounds that year in a contest
conducted by the Liverpool and Man~
cheater railroad for the best locomo»
tive. 0f the five competitors. the
Rocket was the only one to fulfill the
required conditions.

Original at London

The original Rocket is now in the
Science museum at South Kensing—
ton. London, but Henry Ford wished
to have one for his museum at Dear-
horn. He commissioned the original
builders. Robert Stephenson and co.
Ltd. who are still in the same buslr
ness. to make an exact replica.
I Many difficulties were encounter-
ed. The original engine was greatly
modified and improved by George
Stephenson after 1829. As a result.
it is now quite different from what
it was a century ago in the contest.
No complete contemporary drawings
of it could be found. and of course
everybody who had seen it had long
since died.

Terms Confusing
However. by careful study of the
original. observing. for instance. the
posi ons of the rivet holes with
which the fire-box had first been
fastened, an accurate idea was gain-

interest.

Professor Dreese holds from Col-
umbia university a B. s. an A. M. in
psychology and a PhD. in vocational
guidance and college personnel. He
has taught for five years in New
Jersey carrying administrative and
vocational guidance duties. While
attending Columbia he was director
of a boys settlement house on the
lower west side. Mr. Dresse has re
cently completed a Personnel study
of Messenger Boys in New York City
which is now in the hands of the pub-
lishers.

 

work in which he thinks he has an

 

ed of the way it had been made.
some of the terms used in old reoe
ords to describe it were unintelli-
gible. For instance. in an old letter
to his father. Robert Stephenson said
that the tubes of the boiler were
”Chink" in. Nobody has been able to
find out what is meant by "clocking"
or clinking." but the tubes were put
into the replica in the way that was
most probably used.

One curious feature of the ori inal
is that the cylinders were steeply in-
clined. though Stephenson later made
them horizontal. as in modern prac-
tice. The inclined cylinders were
very lightly attched to the boiler, so
that there was always danger of
them wrenching themselves loose
The aorizonal cylinders proved suf-
ficiently rigid. Another peculiar fea-
ture was that no brakes were pro»
vided even though the locomotive
proved itself capable of a speed of 30
miles per hour.
