Question: "Do you incur the pres-
ent idea of having ‘Hell Week’ or
would you rather see prepping return
to the course lollowed last year?"

Paul Durrie: I prefer the old plan,
as the new one tends more toward
hazing than prepping.

Hal-nit] Forrester: 1 cm in favor or
“Hell Week" if it is not carried to
extremes. Paddling should be abol~
isbed in favor of library stunts. quad
Serenades and so forth.

John lice I prefer "Hell Week
My reason for [his is that, although III
is now strenuous for a period, this
period is short compared to an entire
semester,

Charles Woody: I would rather see
prepping return to last year’s plan,
because I would rather do menial
services then stay out all night.

Lloyd Nixon: It seams to me that
last year's prepping system is the
more efficient. First, because it may
eliminate set traditional rules which
might be established for 8. special
week throughuut the year. Second,
because it may eliminate extreme
treatment or these activities during
this special week on the Dirt of the
upperclass men. With better cooper-
eion between both the freshmen cud
upperclass men. I feel that last year's

 

system of prepping is the better.

“'flllace Henderson: Personally, I
favor the present plan of "Hell
Week." It seems to lug that It gives a
better spirit to the building than the
old plan. Win the present plan ti
freshman (eels more as a. member of
a group, but still he receives the
p’repping which is traditional in col-
leges. "Hell Week." run in the
right \my, will prove very successful.

Clifford . ielsen: Prepping us it
wits last year.

Drenllml Miller: I [aver neither.
Why not have prepping as we knew
ii. last year, but in force only from
the first of the year to Thanksgiving?
The benetits oi the old system could
tllen he kept without making the env
tire year unpleasant for the prep.

llamlnll Klemllle: [would like to
see “Hell “leek" cuntinued next year.
I lhi k it satisfies all concerned and
it carries with it me spirit of the
fraternity initiation. The week is short
enough so that it doesn't detract
from the student's other duties.

Henry Bacon: 1 favor “Hell Week,"
as it coniines initiation to one week,
enabling underclcss men to concen-
trate on it good initiation, and assure
ing preps of peace for the rest of
the year.

elson started instead of Meek on
the mound for Smith. He was
touched only during his one weal:
moment in the fifth, hrtving good sup
port from all his teammates, each do-
ing his share toward the victory.
True to early season dope this club
has put on c polish which points
toward a successrul iinish of the
present season.

In the other games, Clark and Dibr
ble taught c close tilt which was fin-
ally won by Dibble. The Clark squad
never let its opponents have a com-
icrfnble load and up to the last hat
the mulls were still close enough to
store any rapid Dibble fan.

Wilhelm Ill Light Game

Wilhelm, on the mound for Dibble.
was up to his usual form, and put
away Clark batters in line order. He
did not receive all the possible sup-
port and was never in a position to
feel easy.

ilinier, Brown and Wilhelm hit like
Veterans for their hull and could be
held accountable fur mosL or the runs.
Greener, Kautz and E. Clayton wor
ed the bat well and coupled with the
tight fielding of their mates were re-
sponsible for nll the worry the Dib-
blites experienced during the game.
