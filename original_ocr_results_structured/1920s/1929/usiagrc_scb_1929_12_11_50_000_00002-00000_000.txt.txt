E
USE OF THE LIBRARY ON SUNDAYl

Last year the suggestion was made through these
columns that the library be open to the students a
few hours every Sunday morning. We would suggest
that a plan providing for even more use of the library
than urged in last year's editorial he given a trial. If
the library could be kept open not only Sunday morn-
ing. but Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon, it
would be a distinct contribution to all those who have
library assignments for Monday morning recitations.

There should not he any religious objection in a
town which permits Sunday movies and allows Sunday
social gatherings to the use of the library on this par-
ticular day, especially scholastic since students study
ing on Sunday would he showing a most scholastic
holiness.

An open library on Sunday would certainly be an
aid to study at a time when there would he the most
ternphation to do so since no outside activities such as
a football game. track or swimming meet, would be
a drawing card away from the lihe.

Another objection to' keeping the library open on

 

Sunday might he the consideration of the library staff
who certainly have a right to a one day vacation.
But if the lending of hooks were suspended during Sat-
urdny evening and Sunday and the library were used
as a simply a place in which to browse there would
he no need for any elaborate supervision. As a mat
ter of fact some student who intended to put in his
whole day at the library might be left in charge thus
eliminating any work whatever on the part of the

A MID»SEl\lESTER CHANGE

And now that we have again token mid-semesters
have had our blue hooks returned. and have sighed or
rejoiced over the results let us consider midesemestcrs
as an institution.

These exams, coming after nine wéeks of work.
are supposed to cover completely the material present:
ed in the course up to that time, From the very fact
that it is an hour exam it must be selective but the slur
dent reviewing for the exam can make no selection.

Many collegc students have four exams in one
morning during mid-semesters. The day and night
before theyattempt to go over the material tor all
these courses and in consequence go to their exams
with minds filled with a heterogeneous mass of un»
coordinated information.

It is not our intention to justify cramming but
we do wish to point out that because classes and as-
signmems continue until the days of exams this prac-
tice often becomes necessary The student who has
reviewed math, French, history and chemistry for one
morning‘s exams and has written rapidly for three
hours cannot be expected to remember much for his
fourth hour exam.

Reviewing for exms scheduled in this fashion
would give the student time to organize each subject
in his mind; moreover, there would be less chance that
only two exams on any one day, a student would be
less likely to gct the chemical formula of soap mixed
up in his mental processes with the assassination of
the Archduke Francis Ferdinand than at present;
his chance or drawing the nervous system would be
much improved if he didn't have to keep fresh in his
mind four or live theories of the origin of speech. In
a word, the results of exams given in the suggested
manner would be much more satisfactory and the
feeling of tension that pervades mid-semester exam
week would be greatly relieved.

We should like to suggest that a new plan be :
adopted for midrsemester examinations which would '
Eight.» :

extend them over four rather than two days.
twenty and ninertwenty o‘clock exams could be sched-
uled for Monday and Tuesday while ten~twenty and
eleveneLwenties could be given on Wednesday and
Thursday. With such a plan no student would have

more than two exams each day,
