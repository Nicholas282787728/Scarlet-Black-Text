WHY NOT BE TOLERANT'.’

Contributions to the “What Do You Think?" colr
unin of the SCARLET AND BLACK have been pour-
ing in at a considerable rate recently. for which we
praise the Fates. or whoever causes disagreement of
opinion, for a healthy disagreement is a sure sign of
a widerawake student body. Nevertheless. this paper
is often criticized for allowing certain opinions to ap—
pear at all. or in the form in’ which they do. We
suspect that today's contributions will bring forth
such criticism. Therefore——

It should he urged on all readers of our "What Do
You Think?" column that they adopt a tolerant atti-
tude toward whatever appears in that part of this
paper. Today's article on Victory Day. for example,
is not signed for that very reason. The writer of it
feels that his opinion constitutes that of a considerable
minority in the school. but that his name should be
omitted because the school will read his article coolly.
but would rather attack him whether he is right
or not. accusing him of disloyalty to the football team.
which anyone who reads the article will readily see
is not the case. ‘

The SCARLET AND BLACK. against its customr
ary policy of printing an unsigned article of this na-
ture is including the article in today's issue. never-
theless. because it contains an element of truth. at
least. which most students will admit, after reading it.

In the future, it is our hope that anyone who
writes contributions to the "What Do You Think"
colugnn and everyone who reads them will adopt this

 

spiri . Each person has a right to express his own
opinion. in n gentienninly way. without being attnckcd
tor it, He may be right; he may be wrong; but we
will always giro him the credit tor lutcueetunl sincer-
ity and not allow our personal ioelings against him to
be changed merely because of an honest opinion ex»
pressed that way.

When that attitude is adopted. an article of the
nature of the one on Victory Day can be signed by

whoever writes it. May that time come Soon!

ICE HOCKEY.

The purpose of Grinnell intramural athletics is to
attract as many men as possible to some sport in which
they may have ability. The success of the intramural
system may be measured by the number of men engag-
ing in some form of sport. The system as it exists in
Grinnell today is quite extensive including speedhall;
interclass, and inter-dorm basketball; cross-country;
track and field sports; swimming; and baseball.

Tm is one sport. that might be added to the inr
tramural system. which should attract a group of men
who may not be drawn into any other form of intere
dorm activity. This sport is ice hockey.

IL ought not be very difficult to provide a rink for
all those interested in ice hockey. The track just in
front of the stadium and part of the grass plot. which
forms a section of the ﬁeld. might be boarded in. so as
to form a square of regulation length. then this square
could be ﬂooded and frozen over.

This should not be detrimental to the track as wat-
er is good for a cinder stretch when it is not in use. The
section of the field proper which was affected would not
be very large and since only the ground along the side-
lines might be utilized. the playing ﬁeld itself would
not suffer from an extended period of sobmergence.

Ice hockey is one or the fastest games known and
because of this fact should prove to be an interesting
spactacle to those who do not play. The addition of
hockey to the’ intramural sport schedule might seem de-
sirable in that it would be the only purely winter sport
in which Grinnell engages. Success in intramural
hockey might eventually lead to the formation of a col—
lege hockey team and Grinnell would be keeping up to
date in the sport world by adding another sport which
has already attained popularity in the East and is gain-
ing popularity in the Middlewest. ‘

Editor. The Scarlet and Black:
Dear Sir: ,

There appeared recently in the col—
umns of the Scarlet and Black the
opinion of one of the members of
the faculty discouraging the proposal
of mixed dinners in the dormitory
and quadrangle dining halls.

As one of those included in the
blanket cri cism I wish to protest
against what I consider an uncalled-
for criti sin.

The writer would be the last to in.
sist that manners in the men’s dln~
ing room are everything that could

 

to correct what seems to him to be a
deluded conception of present con»
ditions.

The critic would do. well to ,in-
quire from any of the faculty epon-
sors who‘ have attended», the numelh
ous mixed dinners of organizations
and classes of the college to find out
whether his criticism is justified.
This writer firmly believes that our

were he to attend one of the
mixed dinners. would discover to his
surprise that manners for men are
not entirely obsolete in Grinnell.

Moreover. the writer has had oc-
casion to dine at several men's halls
in colleges rated on a par with Grin-
nell. Conditions in these other instiv
tutions certainly show that we are
more than holding our own.

If the men's manners in Grinnell
have degenerated as far as one
would lie lead to conclude from the
criticismethen the next move should
be to close the college door—for men.

Respectfully yours.

undertaking—that they must indulge
in rigorous rationalization to justify

There are_ three Lhings for which
students want a victory day: the
omission of classes; the free shows;
and the dance. Make the students
attend classes and there would he
no victory day; give up the free
shows and the dance and there would
