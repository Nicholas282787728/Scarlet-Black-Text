the hnlluill Colonial Brill held last

eighteenth century,

Huston, Elizabcill Bl-eid. Ly
Thiedemdn and Winifred Neilsen ac-
conipzuiied at the piano by Arline

reel, the rye waltz and the firefly-
wnltz.

courtesy of the Women's Honor G so-
ciety. The girls were entertained

.lztrrl‘s OPINION.

Do you approve of Gl'innell's grad
ing system"

Jam; hour It seems to me to he
as good as any grading system. l do
not think the two grade system
whereby students either pass or rail
would be very popular at Grinnell.

Gretchen Sllilifer: I do not think
the block system which is used in the
larger classes here is fair. Further-
more, grades in the present system no
not have a set standard with all the
faculty. A "e" to one professor is a
much higher grade than it is to an»
other.

EtI Brownltriilge: I don't approve ol
the system hecnuse it puts too much
stress on the grade and tends to moiic
the student overlook the true ENVer
ciation oi the course.

(“had Lotion: I approve of the
present method oi grading, In order
to have high standards, we musthave
a system under which it is difticult to
receive high grades.

"If the cougher in the 4th row

will come to the stage door . . . there’s a
carton of Old Golds waiting for him!”

"Of course, I’ve never said Ihe above! But how I’ve been

tempted to, when a heavy bass whoop or a shrill soprano

bark has drowned out my best wise-crack.

"But it isn’t good cricket to publicly emlmrrsss a cougher.

He isn’t barking on purpose. He needs quiet, friendly

counsel. He should, in conﬁdence, he told to smoke
