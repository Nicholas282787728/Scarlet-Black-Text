freshmen are given four places on
the two teams, while the sophs, jul'lr
iors nnd seniors get two each.
James :it Forward

James merited his berth on the
first team because of his ability to
shoot from all angles and his agility
in playing under the basket. Farrara,
tricky little sophomore, is given the
other forward position, not because
of especial natural basketball obi 'ty,
but because he displays an aggressive
spirit and manages to score rather
consistently. When it comes to see
lecting the center man, Duncan, fore
mer Rock Island high school star,
appears the logical choice due to his
all around versatility on the basket-
ball court. His shooting. passing and
generalship from the pivot pos' 'on
have been features of every game.

Moving on back to the defense.
Warner, lanky Chicagoan, loomed up
as the ideal guard Warner, while.
standing above six feet. is unusuallyl
fast on his feet and his consistent
work under fire of opposing forr
wards makes him a logical choice.

Murray, although a discus thrower
by trade, proved his worth on the
court by his ability to stop the
coming plays and his uncanniness in
dropping the ball through the base
ket from the center of the floor.
3000!“! Team

On the second team Kent and Mc-
‘llrath both rated their positions by
virtue of their shooting and ability
to handle passes, while Nielsen,
holding down the center post. proved
that he is a consistent player wheth-
er oii offensive or defensive. U117
rich, former member of the Y. M, c.
A, National Championship team, left
most of the scoring to his team-
mates, but handled his job of guard
in n very praiseworthy manner.
Liedtke, while handicapped by his
size, more than made up for it in
the way he handled the ball whether
he was on the receiving or sending
end of the pass.

‘Recent Stock crash Has Little Effect
on This Section of Country’ Says Mount

(By Miriam Spnulding)

“This country will be less affected
than other parts by the reccnt crash
of the stock market and in this re-
spect is relatively better off than it
was a year ago. Industry and mere
".iintlle interest will feel the shock
more directly than those interests de—
pendent upon the income derived from
agricultural production," said Prof.
L. E. Mount of the business adminis-
tration department of Grinnell college
when interviewed recently.

"Tile income from agricultural IDV
terests for 1929 will approximate that
oi 1023. Farmers are more hopeful,
and although little can be definitely
prophesied, agricultural conditions
point to a brighter future. The ef~
i forts of the farm board are contribut-
ing to this condition.

“However, what has happened may
not he as important as what may
icome. The present rallies in the mar
iket are not in accordance with some
‘basic business conditions and a sec-
:ondary reaction may come before late
lspring; although it may not be a
break in any sense. Thus, there may
'be an opportunity, a little later on, to

have resulted in a period of wide-
spread and more prolonged depres

Because 0[ the crash, Mr. Mount
feels that production in many fields
has tended toward reduction. At the
present time, the steel manufactur-
ing mills are being operated at only
60 oi 70 percent normal production,
instead of so or as percent of can
pacity Lessened activity in this
and other lines of business is a slack~
ening of employment and the per-
cent of unemployed men may be
greater during the first six months
of 1930 than was the case in any six
months in 1920. i,

”The most immediate result of thel
