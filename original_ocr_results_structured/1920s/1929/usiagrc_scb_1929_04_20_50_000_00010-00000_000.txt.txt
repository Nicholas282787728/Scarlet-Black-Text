Saturday, .iprll 27, 1929.
Vol. x xvr. No. 51.

C at: and the I nstruqlor.

The past u-cck has seen more
rigid enforcement of the cut sys-
tem. in response, it is believed, to
action taken at a faculty meeting.
As long as the present regulation
concerning class absences remains
on the books it undoubtedly
should be enforced, for laxity in
executing one law is apt to breed
disrespect of all laws.

However, it is our opinion, that

‘both professors and students
would be beneﬁted more than hurt
if the cut system were (liscontinv
ucd. This editorial will deal only
with the professor’s side of the
question.

The present cut system, we be-
lieve, handicaps the instructor by
giving him a piece of book-keep
ing which though slight in itself
when added to that connected

"with grade recording presents a
formidable task. The primary
function of the teacher, naturally,
is to teach and it would seem logi-
cal to eliminate as far as possible
any duties which interfere with
this function.

The present cut system, involv—
ing as it does the necessity of call»
ing the roll at the beginning of
each class takes the opening min-
utes of the period which might be
better used for the subject itself.
The time wasted in larger classes
of thirty or over is not inconsider-
able.

Lastly the cut system removes
the stimulus afforded a lecturer
under a voluntary attendance sys~
tent to interest his audience and
prevents him from measuring the
success of his attempts by noting
increased or decreased attendance
in following lectures. To address
a group of people compelled to an
tend class by the waving of a. “big
stick" must, we imagine, give some
instructors the same empty feeling
that a musician experiences when
he plays for an audience whom he
knows has been paid to applaud
him. Arthur de Persia.

Senior Exams.

The objection of seniors to ﬁnal
examinations is due to universal
student dislike for tests rather
than. dread or reason. Examinav
tions will present no new obstacles
to those who have passed three
and one-half years of college work.
If examinations were proved ohx
solcte and a report better, the sub-
stitutes should be extended for the
advantage of all classes. But in
eastern and English universities
whose educational systems are ad-
mitted lenient and experimental
by students, seniors are required
to pass comprehensive examina-
tions exhibiting a Working know-
ledgc of their major and minor be-
sides tests in other subjects.

A report extensive enough to
displace an examination would be
burdensome both to student and
professor.

The hardest argument to sur-
mount is that the senior wishes to
foster the acquaintancship of his
four years at college during the
examination period. Yet other
classes studying for exams will

have little time for enjoying co
radeship. The seniors will min»
gle during commencement. Any
longer period of genuine regret at
parting with Grinllrll would be~
conic maudlin.

The alumnus will bcncﬁt by the
strengthening of the hitherto high
scholastic standard of Griuuell
with the institution of senior ex-

ominations.

CAhﬂ'US OPINION

Questio Do you approve of senior
examinations?

Arthur Kisser: I believe a substi»
tute {ul- exams like a ﬁnal report
should be given to‘the seniors. The
nrgnniaztiou of material uecesarv for
a report. does more good than an ex-
umiumuu.

Grace McElroy: No, I certainly do
not. After students have attended col-
lege for four years and have done
their work satisfactorily they should
he allowed to graduate without the
bother of writing fiuul examinations.
Seniors‘ however, who are in danger.
of fluukiug a course will probably be
grateful for a chance to write a. final
examination. Let then: write the ex-
ams, but don't burden the others who
will be busy enough then anyway.

Miss Boyd: 1n the main ,I favor
senior examinations, inasmuch as they
may prove to be profitable reviews
rather tbau irksome duties.

Mary Stevenson: 1 see absolutely no

reason why a candidate for a B A.
degree, with (our years of college
work behind him, should try to avoid
exams the last semester of his course.
it seems to me n lack of mental en-
ergy and a general lackadaisical qual-
ity unbecoming to people who intend
to become part of the more intellir
gent. portions of society.

Kr. Muck: Good students don’t ob-
ject to them, and poor students need
them.

Mr. Knight: Before a candidate {or
M. A. or Ph. D. can receive his degree,
he must take the stiflest examinations
of his career. I see no reason why a
college senior should seek to escape
this particular means uf piuviug his
right to his degree.

Margaret Weishnar: By the time a
student reaches his senior year he
ought to be personally responsible
enough for his own work without hav-
ing the menace of exams hanging over
him.

in. Wittlcr: The whole theory of
the use and value of examinations is
involved. Like quinine or an operation
on the tonsils examinations are breach
ed by students and instructors alike,
Yet the immense range of ditterences
among seniors, the common practice
among colleges of first rank and otb.
er latcol‘s enter in. compromises have
Proved Door makeshifts, and unwork-
able. The question might be re-stat-
ed: Will senior examinations add to
or detract from the high academic
standards.

Charles Full: 1 don’t approve ol
seniors exams. As seniors have learn-
ed their work thoroughly enough to
pass exams for three and one half
years they will probably be prepared
this semester. or course exams should
be given it the instructor is unsure
of a student's mile. Exams home
at a time when seniors Want to cor-
respond for jobs. They come when
the seniors want to renew and
strengthen the associations and

substitute would be a report

“Does it pay to advertise?” It pays those

: It pays the man whose product deserves the

organize for success and judge enough of
the human mind to know how to tell their

So when you judge advertising, judge it by
how it is used and by whom—not of itself

Thomas Carley: Why should they

will graduate? Let them have the few
remaining days to enjoy the life they

Margaret Napier: Another way of
detracting from the joy bf commence-
ment. Senior exams are an unneces—
sary waste at time for both student
body and faculty—and therefore
should not be given.
