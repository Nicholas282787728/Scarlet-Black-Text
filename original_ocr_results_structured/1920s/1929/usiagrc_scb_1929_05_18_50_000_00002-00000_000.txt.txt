sntimluy, llny Is, 1929.

Two editorials picked at ran
(him from the University Daily
Kansan indicate the present
trend in college editorials. The
policy of printing comments not
only on campus activities, but upon
world problems has become widely
followed in the ﬁeld of collegiate
publications. Harvard university
devotes little of its space to any
but national topics; most of the
Big Tell universities give more
than half of then editorial inches
to outside discussion.

Snell u plan seems logical for
the SCARLET AND BLACK.

COOLIDGE IS SETTLED.
The public, at last, breathes a,

Coolidge has a job. He has been!
elected to a position on tile board
of directors of the New York Life
Insurance company. The particllr
laJ‘ committee on which he will
work is the Agency committee.
He is taking the pace, on tlle
board, made vacant by the death
of Myron T. Herrick, late ambds-l
sddor to France.

Mr. Coolidge’s lack of deﬁnite
plans since March 4, concerning his
work has caused no little comment,
and speculation on What he
would do. There have been tales
that he would associate himself
with this company and that one,‘
that he would write for magazines
and papers, and that he would»
practice law. It has not worried
Mr. Coolidge so much; he has not
been in a hurry to tie himself
down again. But in time he will}
have another place in the world;
equal to that which he has held
the past few years.

CHINESE DEMOCRACY.

The Chinese republic has just
ﬁnished the erection of a monu-
ment costing two million dollars
and a road leading to it which cost
three million dollars, to mark the
grave of Sun Yet Sell, the ﬁrst
democratic ruler of the republic.
The road, built ruthlessly through
property so that it entailed the
l-azing of many Chinese homes, is
held responsible for one hundred
eight suicides of persons whose
homes were destroyed.

It has been remarked that only
a people so carelss of the living
and reverent of the dead as the
Chinese could have deliberately
made so llllneces y a sacriﬁce.
It is a queer point of irony that
the sacriﬁce should have been
made to honor the man, who, as a
democratic leader, most probably
fought for the class of men whose
homes were destroyed. Perhaps
some day Chinese construction will
have reached a scope where it can
plan projects without forgetting
the considerations involved. At
present it would seem to be one
of China’s greatest needs.

Campus Opinion

Question: “II a financial gill were
presented to the college for a build—
ing, what do you think should be
built?"

Dodu Nollcu: In my mind there are
three outstanding needs. First, a sci-
ence building; second, a music and
arts building; and third, a ﬁeld
house'. But I hope none will donate
n building without an endowment to
support ll, Every unendowed build
ing is a white elephant on our hands,

)Iiss llluqllonnld: It wouldn’t be
hnrd to guess what I third: is needed.
Anyone who has visited the School of
Music can easily see that n new build-
ihg is needed there.

Arthur 11' sex: rd say a new line
fine' arts building, with provision for
painting, music, and an experimental
theatre.

Murillo Lnunom: on, a, neu- music
hall, I guess; but I do kind at like
the old one. And a new women’s gym-
nssium; the old one IS quite insul-
tieieut. You might iix up most every»
thing, and have two swimming pools.
A new dance hall would be nice, but
other things are needed more.

Robert Mark: They need a. new
field houseand Ihey need a, new chem»
istry building, I wouldn't care to cum~
mit ruyseli us to which should come
first.

Edith Jay: A new science building.

lIt's so crowded in Blair. We in my

the chemistry department, and the

relative value (it Ihe various organ»
izatlohs and activities; in short, the
aim was to make the SCARLET AND
BLACK more Grinnellian while atthe
some time widening its scope inm
the collegiate field as a whole.
First Change Since 1926
There has been no editorial or news
policy Since 1926 when the SCAR-
LET AND BLACK was reorganized.
The following quotation is a part of
the news story in the issue 0! Feb
rllary 3, 1326 setting forth the prin-
clple oi the organization:
“A managing editor and a board of

editorial Writers Will replace the edi»
[Orvinrchief of the Scarlet and Black
as a result of a reorganization voted
Monday night, The new plan will
go into effect after spring vacation
when a, new management is elected.

“At present the editor has had to
write the editorials and bear the re-
sponsiulllIy of editing the paper each
Wednesday and Saturday, but under
the new plan the duties will be divid-
ed, The managing editor will have
charge of the writing and editing the
news, which a board of three per-
sons, one oi whom shall be a woman,
will write editorials,

Decision Rests With Editor
“The central authority will rest
with the managing editor, as he will
be responsible for the content of the
paper, news and editorial He will
he chairman of the editorial board

and although he cannot require his
editorial writers to write against their
own convictions he will have ﬁnal
decision as to what shall be printed.
Whenever the board does not Care to
handle a. topic, the managing editor
may write the editorial. The jour-
nalism instructor will also serve as
a member of the editorial board but
in an advisory capacity only. He will
have not vote."

A: the policy reads, it plnces in
writing the aims and practices which
have been unwritten herewiore.
This move on the part or the scan—
LET AND BLACK is quite in keeping
with the general movement through—
out the uewpdper world toward a
more definite and vigorous editorial
policy.
