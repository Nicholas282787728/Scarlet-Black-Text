BASS SOLOIST IS POPULAR

Entire Program. Ath‘ilcls Attention by
Shun) Contrasts null Humor of
Infectious Nature.

By G.‘ Herbert Knight

Much interest centered in the apv
pearance of the Russian Symphonic
Choir in the Herrick chapel last
night, for it is seldom that an oppor.
tunity is afforded of hearing a pro
gram of Russian tour and art songs
sung with native eloquence and en-
thusiasm, and it is infrequently indeed
that an organization of the calibre of
the Russian choir sings to any other
than large-town audiences.

Ari-ayed in Old World costumes. the
Russian Symphonic Choir thrilled'the
fairly large‘audlellce attending their
first concert in Grinnell; and it may
be safely prophesied that, should the
choir ever return to this city, the Herr
rick chapel will be found all
too small to accommodate the many
clamoring for admittance.

The Russian choir presented last
night a melange of Church Canticles
and folk, art, street and dance songs;
a program challenging attention be—
cause of its sharp contrasts, its dar—
ing and its infectious humor. ' The
names of the composers represented
on the program included those of
Gretehaninoff, Tschaikowslrv, Lvov»
shy and Rimsky-Korsakoff,

The items giving most pleasure to
the sophisticated were, perhaps,
Stroliille‘s "Prayer of St. Simeon,”
Bortuihnsky's “Psalm" and Rimsky-
Korsakoff's "Church Scene”; but oth-
er compositions gaining unanimous
and vociferous recognition (by virtue
or virtuose and spectaculer treatment)
were Rimsky-Korsakolf's “Saul-i0,"
and the "Volga. Boatmeu's Song," and
“Soldier's Marching Song." sung by
the choir-men only,

The principal soloist heard last eve-
ning was Ivan Steschenko, whose vir-
ile and vibrant voice was heard to ad—
vantage in the Strakine ”Prayer," He
gave a responsive audience good rear
son for an outbreak of marked en-
thusiasm.

,It is quite possible that the Russian
choristers would not claim that the
choir possesses all those admirable
qualities that contribute to the making
of the flerfect choral organization; but
admittedly they have a highlyrspeclal-
ized technique and a pronounced and
effective erpertness in the matters of
coloring. shading and gradation of
tone. The quality of the soprano
and contralto voices is not always re~
markable for its purity‘and its rich-
ness. nor does thc choir produce that
unifrno quality of tone necessary for
a complete blending of the voices. To
the listener unacquainted with the
Chair’s working methods it would
seem that the singers seldom make
any deliberate effort to achieve an
exquisit blend, although a close ap—
proach to that desirable condition is
observable when the softest strains
were sung.

The Chair's best blended effort was
made in Rimsky»Korsakof£'s "Church
Scene,” and in this beautiful piece,
with the choristers singing quietly
throughout, the choir made the deans
est impression of the evening. In jub-
ilant and humorous music the singers
have an exhilarant effectiveness; but
an ebullient enthusiasm occasionally
affects their quality of tone. In all
its attacks and in nearly all of its re»
leases the choir is highly proficient,
and its response to Mr. Basile Kihal-
chich's subtle and delicate indications
of pitch, phrasing and nuancing is
ready and 'exact.

There can he few, if any, of those
who heard the Russian symphonic
Choir last night who would not on-
courage it in its splendid mission of
familiarizing the people of the United
States and other countries with the
emotional power and dlversty 01
Russian Song.

SPENCER ’I‘ALKS 0N
GRECIAN ORATORS

Graft < “1‘11: Among the First Yeoplc
to Cast Off War Clothes, He Sit

When the Grinnell Forensic met in
regular meeting last Wednesday
night, the beginnings of oratory were
traced back to ancient Greece. both
in the main speech of the evening and
in the short cuttings which each mem-
ber of the organization gave as a roll
call response.

Frof. E. B. T. Spencer characterized
the ancients of Greece as among the
first of primitive peoples to cast aside
war garments and take to the ways of
commerce, industry and literature of
peace, It was only in keeping with
this development, at first, of merely
primitive forms of the arts and the
industries, that the first oratory was
of a distinctively unpolished sort, too.

Once a beginning had been made
when such men as the literary hero,
Achilles, or the old counsellor Nestor.
had stood apart from the other war-
iors to urge them on in battle, the
popularity of orators rapidly grew.

Oratory soon became a profession
for some men, for the best orator:
were always in demand upon certain
occasions. Men who could speak well
finally came to occupy a place in the
hearts of the people like that which
great wariors had occupied in previous
years. Demosthenes was a great
speaker, Mr. Spencer said, but even
Demothenes admitted that there was
a still more wonderful orator living
in his days whose words enthralled
the masses, but hose speeches were
never recorded. Knowing Demos-
thenes as we do, Mr. Spencer said he
wondered how it must have been to
have heard this still more charming
speaker. '

in continuing. Prof. Spencer spoke
of the great literary works which the
ancient Greeks had written on the art
of persuasion, and he listed the ten
Greeks who are acclaimed the best
craters of that nation.

The standings of the Buildings in
the race for the intramural champion—
ship which nere published in last
Wednesday's Scarlet and Black
aroused the question 01' how each
Building garnered their points and an
explanation of the point system being
used in the trophy race was obtained
from the athletic department.

Dibble hall won the speedball tour»
nament with ﬁve victories and no (lee
feats. They received 100 points for
this victory and therefore each game
won was worth 20 points. in the
cross country meet Building One
placed first and gained 100 points.
Since only three teams were entered
in the harrier race, second place I'ea
ecu-ed ltwo»tlllrds of 100 points which
is 67, and third place received one-
third of a 100 (”'33 points. In the has-
ketball series Dibble ag ‘n copped first
with eight wins and two losses. Hg-
uring eight games as a standard or
100 points. each game won was worth
twelve and eneehalt points.

Clark hall leads the ﬁeld thus far
in the race with 257 points. In the
speedhall tournament the Clarksters
netted 65 points, 25 of which were
gained by having a full team for cacti
contest, By ﬁnishing second in the
cross country meet they received 67
points plus 25 for entrance, Tying
for third in the Basketball tournament
with six victories and four defeats
they obtained 75 points plus the ﬁddle
tional entrance points.

Langan hall which is second in the
standing with 2551!; points secured 35
points in sneedbnll. In the cross
country meet the Langanites chalked
up 53 points. ﬁnishing second in the
basketball tournament guvc them
1121.5 points.

Dibble with 250 poiu’ts is in third
place. Gaining 125 points in
speedball and 125 in the has-
ketball accounts for the Dibble
points. Building Three garnered 105
points in the Speedball series and 100
points in the basketball tourney.

Smith hall obtained 25 points in the
speedball tournament, 125 in cross
country, and 371/; in ha -ethall, Build-
ing Foul- received 20 points in speed-
bztll and is in basketball.

The points awarded to the Building
for having the highest scholastic
standing will not be added till the end
of the year.

with the names of the judges will he
announced later. Students are asked
to await such announcement before
submitting manuscripts.

“There awards are not intended to
compete in any way with the Henry
York Steiner prize,” said Wayne Gard
today. “One reason for their being
restricted to freshmen and
mores is that members of these classes
are usually nosed out of the Stciner
prize by upperclassmeu."

"It is hoped also that those prize
awards will promote more student in»
tercst in the Tanager. The Tanager
is supported entirely by freshmen and
sophomores. This year not a single
subscription has been received from
the two upper classes.”

John Pierson, '28, has been added to

Using two complete teams, Coach
Black hoped to check the losing
