The plan is patterned otter that in vogue in many
large universities, that or having at publication board as
the deciding voice in the issuing of all college pencil»
icals. The hoard would bc composed oi three student
members and two [tom the faculty, so that the students
would have the deciding voice in all questinlls. its
functions would be to keep a. check on the editors and
business managers, audit their books and perhaps publish
financial statements, select the succeeding heads and
settle all disputes, political and otherwise,

Its proponents declare that the board would provide
a means or making certain that editors and business
managers were chosen on merit alone, that it would settle
disagreements between students and iaeulty, and that
the student supporters are, and would he, entitled to luiow

The student council, the [acuity and the administration
deserve our congratulation and thanks tor the way in
which they co-operated to make the day possible, and
there is no doubt but that it was a decided success. I

it was quite a concession on the part or the latulty
to give up a day’s work at such a time. and ior the nd-‘
ministration to concede it when every cut meant
money. We \lollld venture to wager that in tow schools‘
could be round such an admirable spirit oi teroperation.
dull we wonder it the average student appreciates it.

' In the majority or courses a certain amount or work
is required to he covered beioi-e the end oi the semester
and many- prots have this so well divided up that the lo
ot one day makes consider-able dirrerence to their sched

the next tew days to make the “ark just a little harder-
and the assignments just a little longer in order to make
up tor the time missed.

What are you going to do about it? Are you going.
to grumble about the increase in work, or are you going.
to remember the concession of the facility when you
wanted a iaror, and play [air by attacking the work with,
