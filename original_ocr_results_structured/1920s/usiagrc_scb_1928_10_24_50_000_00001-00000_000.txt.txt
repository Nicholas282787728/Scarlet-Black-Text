Drake Triumphs Over Grinnell In
Homecoming Battle Saturday
By Score of 19 to 7.

l
PASS ATTACK SENSATIONAL

Periods But Stages Come-
back In Second Half.

That tenacious Drake bull dog still
has his oaken bucket but only those
who saw the Grinnell football game
last Saturday night can appreciate
just how close be came to losing his
favorite biscuit conveyor. The score
of 19 to 7 in favor ot Drake certain-

—- ly doesn’t indicate the margin of via-
tory. Still looking in tile punch at
the goal line, as was the case with
Kansas and against Ames, the Pio-
neers threatened the Drake goal
three times, pushing the oval across
only once.

Not only did Grinnell
threaten at the goal, but the aerial
attack of the scarleteclad, gridmcn
was bewildering at all times, even to
the open-mouthed spectators who
gasped in awe as the Pioneers travel~
ed 80 yards in less than four minutes
in the fourth quarter.

Grillilell stages Comeback

Crinnell was clearly outplayed
during the first half, the line evident_
1y being outcharged by the Drake
'huskies, and the entire Outﬁt exper-
iencing difficulty banging on to the
elusive Drake bucks. The first
touchdown u-ns hardly in accordance
with good football when King got
away for 43 yards and a touchdown.
in the second period Van Koten
scored and in the fourth quarter
Nesbitt shoved the ball over,

The Grinnéll aerial attack
not be called into play during the
first quarters, chiefly because the
game was almost entirely in Crin-
nell territory and a short intercepted
pass would have spelled disaster.

Just following the last sustained
Drake offensive which culminated in
a touchdown early in the fourth
quarter, Ernie Mclntlre, calling sig-
nals for Grinnell, threw caution to
the winds and opened a passing ate
trek, the like ot which has seldom
been seen in the ‘rnidwest. .rasses
fnirly mined at every side of the
field, coming from nowhere and al-
ways landing in the arms of a Grin-
neli player.

Several spectacular catches and
sensational passing were in order
with Ruff, Fail, ilclntire and several
others in the limelight, as the line-
men battled on even terms with the
Bulldogs and protected the passers.
Just after Rufmeblled a pass on
Drake 16 yard line, a 15 yard pen-
alty for roughness, put the ball on
the one yard ribbon and Rose took
it over on a line plunge. Ruff booted
the oval between the crosshnrs end
with but a few minutes remaining to
play, Drake elected to receive.

Puss Attack Sensational

\Vitli a, touchdown tucked in their
lielts, the Pioneers held the home
eleven and the ultimate winners were
forced to kick Starting again from
their own territory, the Grinnellians
ODGned another uttiick which had
the onlookers fairly breathless with
the speed and smoothness with
which it functioned. Down to the
nine yard line went the battling
Scarlet and Black team only to be
held there by the well nigh frantic
Solem proteges. Drake kicked out of
this dangerous position and Grinnell
opened the passing attack again as
the gun sounded.

It was at thrilling game, With a
breathtaking finish and a closeness
that . not shown by. the score, bei'hg
marred only by the iliil'aclons of the
rules by the Drake playe‘ . who Sufr
