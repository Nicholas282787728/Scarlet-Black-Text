If you do, surely you
will read this one

One ﬁne day a Sophomore from a ludlng Univer—
sity came to see us, suggesting that we advertise in
their undergraduate paper, and best of all convinced
us, and this is how he did it:

First—He believed in Life Insurance because his

uncle (in good buiincss man) had advised him re
buy some.

Senor-dim: Father died in the prime of life nnd
good health and left all-nos: n insurance when
he could have carried $50,000.

‘l'llivd—He also knew that he could buy Insurance

NOW at half the annual cost his uncle and

Father had plaid for theirs.
All this convinced him that even though a student,
he should take out as much Life Insurance as his
allowance would permit.

What About You?

Eve college student looks forward to a career,
whic will make possible the fulﬁllment of the most
cherished desires—surely Insurance is a necessary
part: of this program.

Insure, in part at least: (lie value of your educated
self, NOW, making up your mind to increase it as
business or professional success follows.

The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Com'
pany issues all forms of Life Insurance, endowments
for home and estate protection, mortgage replace—
