Is Keenly Felt; Number of
Reserves On Hand.

By EDWARD ALLEN
Concluding a week‘s intensive prac»
tice witll a scrimmage against Central
college oi Pella this morning, the 1923
Pioneer iootbail squad, including ten
letter men. tine sophomore material
and good reserve power, is rapidly
shaping up as a strong, rwellrbdlanced
group oi players. Led by Captain
Charles "Chuck" Fall. the team will
take the field: ior the iirst time a
week from toda then they will op—
pcse Penn college oi oskaloosa, on
Ward iield.

Two hard ses-
sions a day have
been dished out

ihave heeil stressed and old plays re-

hearsed, while the aitcrnoons have

been given over to learning and [term

iccting new plays, including sonle

which the Pioneers expect to use

against Penn next Saturday. in the

last iew aiternons scrimmages, in

which various plays were tried out,
have been the bill.

Outlook llilcoumgiug \

Perhaps the keynote to the encourr
‘aging outlook in the Pioneer camp
this tail is the iact that for each nosie
tion on the team here will be strong,
experienced reserves. coach Watt has
been using a number or men at each
position. each oi whom have peen
lighting hard tor a place on the team
that will iace Penn.

While the Grinnell “its will greatly
miss "Sonny" Davis, last year's cap.
taln and all-state tackle, yet it will
average nearly lxll pounds irom end
to end, and will be coiilposed largely
oi veterans. ‘At the pivot position,
Evenor Bradley and Meredith: Heid-
ridg'e, both letter-men, and John
Spencer, a member of the 192s squad,
have been getting the call, with Brad
ley having a slight edge due to ,his
experience

Plenty oi Guards

Flanking the center have been
Charles Parish, veteran guard, and
Bi-adiord, a sophomore lvlio tips the
scales at over lilo. and whose job it
is to on the shoes oi Raymond Cie-
lend, poudcrous guard at last year
Artllur Cox, a junior, Norton, Brown-
bridge and Letton are others who are
lighting for the guard pos tions.

At the tackles will likely he Paul
Klineielter, amenibcr oi last year's
team. and Carleton Humphrey, giant
sophomore, who iaccs a hard task in
stepping into "Sonny" Davis' place
Humphrey made a tine rccord on the
ii-eshrnan team last tall. Lowell Walks
er, another sophomore, is lllso being
used at tackle, as is Carroll Dewey.

Several Ellils Available

The nlimbcr oi candidates ior end is
plentiiul, with Captain Fail, Charles
Briggs, hcth lettei-mcn, and .\iinlci~,
