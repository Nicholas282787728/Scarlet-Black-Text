tul program in Herrick chapel Friday

the Mendelssohn and Arensky trios

fine precision. Haunting rhythm and
sweetness of tone characterized their
filial encore, “Au bord run Ruisseau"
by de Boisdeffre.

,Milton Dieterich, 'cellist, who was
graduated from the Grinnell school of
music in 1923. performed in a most
creditable manner. His solos. “Ser-.
enade" and “Vito” by Popper, and an
encore "Swedish Foil: Song" gave him
an opportuni , to display remarkable
control of his instrument. He achiev-
ed both rapidity and smoothness or
tone in the per-tormauce oi technicals
1y complex selections.

Josef Noll, pianist, was so pleased
with the Grinncll ”auditorium“ that
he announced a change in his selec-
tions and played the' first and sec~
ond Debussy Preludes instead of the

effective interpretation oi the diffi-
cult Debris - riuiribers evidenced his
understanding of modern mus His
encore. “Spanish Dance" by De ralla,
also exhibited his abundant enthus-
iasm antl fine technique.

The violin solos of Paul Carpenter
abounded in rapid bowing, double
stops. and delicate harmonics, which
he executed with fascinating ease.
His numbers were “Player-a" and Zane
aleatlo," two Spanish dances by Pablo
de Sarasate, and "Doll Dance" by
Poldini.

ketball has a new foe to combat in
the sports columns. Hockey ,a sport
or kings and Canadians, has taken
thrill-hungry Americans by storm
and for the past month the opening of
the leagues in the larger c’ 'es bids
lair to eclipse the late grid games.
The reason for the popularity of
hockey, an unknown game to most
Crinnell students, is not hard to find.

Hockey has the really attractive
elements of all games. There is the
low score. the continual crisis of
baseball; the speed of basketball in-
creased three fold and the body con-
tact or football. There is a zip. atlre
and a dash to the game that keeps
the audience interested during every
minute. its basic thrill is its danger,

trainer these days," he continues. “It
needs a milllner or a sewing machine,
or something like that."

Such a game. were it possible to
play it in most colleges, would unr
doubtedly catch the eye or the Amer-
ican youth. Already Minnesota lini-
vurslty, Wisconsin university and
Marquette have formed their own con-
iereuce and battle among themselves
for the,championslrip. They are for
ced to meet selnispl'ofessionnl teams
from the athletic clubs of larger cities
for most Of the games however.

Hockey probably puts a greater
strain on a player than any other
sort of contest because there are no
time outs. If somebody is injured
he is merely hauled off the ice while
the battle rages without him. In-
fractions of the rules are taken care
of by keeping it player out of the
game for a number for minutes, the
usual length of time being two min-
utes. Thus occasionally two or three
men are battling the entire opposing
sextet.
