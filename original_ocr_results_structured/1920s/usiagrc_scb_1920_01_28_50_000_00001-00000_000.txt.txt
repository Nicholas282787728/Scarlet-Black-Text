Coe Has Veteran Team
—Washington In-

vades Iowa.
' \

Two games are on the basketball
schedule for this week, the Pioneers
meeting Coe here Wednesday night,
while the Washington University quills
tet ivill invade the local camp Friday
night. The ﬁrst game will have no
bearing’on the conference race, but
the second contest ivrll go far towards
boosting one team or the other up
the ladder. ‘

Coe has a team composed of vets
eraus of several years aperience, and
should be one of the best teams which
will appear on the local floor this
season. They Won from Carleton in
an easy game by a score or 16 to s,
and while they later lost to Knox col.
lege by a 29 to 22 count the defeat was
due largely to injuries.

Washington Here Priday.

Washington university of st. Louis
will invade Iowa with an experienced
quintet Wednesday night, when they
open at Ames for a two-day stand.
Friday they ivill battle the Pioneers,
and will go on to Des Morncs tor a
game with Drake Saturday night. The
local contest was originally scheduled
for Saturday,_but owing to a mix up
in dates was transferred to Friday.

The Pikers have lost the two con—
ference games they have played this
‘year, but have dete'ated one or two
schools outside of the cunfel‘er'lcn.
Marquardl, all Missouri-Valley football
center, is playing a like position on the
basketball squad. Last year he was
conceded to be one of the best basket»
ball men in the valley, and experts or
the indoor game are watching the ‘big
illissourian closely this year.

. Athletic relations were ﬁrst estab-

_lished with the St. Louis s’chool last
fall, when the Pioneers journeyed to
S}. Louis for a football contest. The
game Frida‘y, however, will he the
ﬁrst chance Pioneer fans have had to
sea the Pikers in action, and it is an—
ticipated that a big crowd will be on
hand to see the Washington team
make its debut

HECITAL BY ‘BUNNE-l
, ls mulch iiiii

Famous Organist Shows Genius in
Technique and Expression in
Recital Monday.

The organ recital by Joseph Bone
net Monday night proved a musical
treat to the large audiancc which
heard him. He is hailed everywhere
as a master and a genius, and Grin—
ncll can testify to the iustness of
these titles.

In his program, Bonnet showed
his ability both in technique and ex—
pression. He brought out the wide
possibilities of the organ, its capacity
for expression. from the tender-est
lullaby to the most brilliant fugue,
from the dainty popular gavotte to
the heavy Funeral March. His use
of the var-ions stops of the organ was
telling; there was variety and cheat-
iveness without detracting the atten-
tion from the music itself. It is by
this abiliy to bring real music to his
'audienccs that Bonnet wins'their ap-
proval. The music, not the technique
or the unusual etlects, is emphasized.

However, in ordcr to gain this mus»
foal effectiveness, technique is news
sary, and Bonnet has all and more
than is needed. His playing is ryth»
uric, clear hour on manuals and pad-
als, and not hindered in the least by
the most involved and difficult pass
sages, as was shown in the rendition
of the Bach Toccata and Fugue,

El interpretation he has sympathy
an a sense of ﬁtness in the use of the
various registers to bring out the ﬁn
est shades of feeling.

This was Bonnet's second appear.
ance in Gi'innell, and the enthusiastic
audience who heard him is proof that
Grinncll is eagcr for such organ play-
ing as be displayed. .

REVIEW l3 HOUSTEH
IH STUDEHT BHAPEL

lEgloff, Esden, Wadsworth, Minty,
Sibley and Ladd Give
Talks.

Great enthusiasm for the Grinnell
Review was shown by the student
speakers in chapel Monday morning,
Max Eglol'f, ’20, who presided, empha-
sized the necessity of Student backing
for the enterprise, especially as the
Review has not the ﬁnancial backing
usual in starting 8. new publication.

Estelle Esden, ‘20. pointed out that
the trophy cup, which is being offered
to the literary societies securing the
greatest number of subscriptions in
the present campaign, is only inci—
dental, and that the real object ofrthe
contest is to further the interest of
Crinnell. , ‘

Harriet» Wadworth, '22, expressed
her personal approval at the magazine
itselt, as containing articles written
to express the unbiased views of the
authors. ‘

‘ Charles Minty, '20, endorsed the pub—
lication because of the literary need it
ﬁlls, and the opportunity it will give
to radiate the Grinnell atmosphere, es—
pecially among prospective students,

Adelaide Sibley, '21. asked for stu—
dent support of the Review as a thor—
oughly Griuncll enterprise, urging a
personal subscription, as well. as en—
thusiastic advertising.

Mason Ladd, be, summed up the
campaign as an opportunity to do
something for Grlnnell that is worth
the doing in itself. He characterized
the Review as a progressive enterprise
which will have a widening scope and
influence if given the advantage of
hearty support by the students, fac-
uity, and alumni in its beginnings.

MITGHEll WRITES IF
SOUTH AMEHIGAN LIFE

Is Big Opportunity For Young
Men There HelWrites From
Santiago, Chile.

0. Hugh Mitchell, '19, who is repre-
senting Crinnell Gloves, interwoven
Hose and several other lines or goods,
is located with Will L. Smith, Exa
porter, at Santiago, Chile. He has
written a letter to the Scarlet and
Black, a part of which is published be
low.

Dear Friends: I promised to write a
letter about my trip down here as soon
as l arrived, but have been so very
busy trying to hold onto the reverse
side of the world thatsl have not had
the time until now.

I left New York on Sept. 11th on a
boat bound ‘for Havana, Port’ Limon,
and Panama. it was ﬁlled with Span-
ish speaking people, andl soon learned
how nccessary it was to speak this
language. Otherwise there were a
number of rather nice looking girls
aboard whom it would be impossible
to talk to. A calamity indeed,

Cur lirst stop was in Havana, and
there I learned to eat mnngoe. One
ovcning in the Hotel Lafayette alter
we had ﬁnished dining one of my
newly-made acquaintances from Pan-
ama suggested 1 try some mangoes.
They all seemed so anxious to see how
I would like them that I said sure I
would eat one. The waiter brought
some, and the fun started. All inns»
rcenlly I bit into one and the juice
squirted not only all over inc but them
as well.’ That sort or squelched the
glaugh but, they still kid me about eat-
ig mangoes in a restaurant. The
worst, or best part of it, is that they
are very good eating. Only now I have
llearnetl to eat them in a shower bath.

iii the foreground, and on the other,
the chimney/Io the canal.

After about rive days in Panama I
started down the coast. Our iii-st stop
was in Payta, the home of the Panama
hat. There for a pound I bought a
hat that would cost twenty-ﬁve dul—
lars at hoi’i’ie. Even Swisher Bros.
don't have hats like it. At this same
port I saw a very interesting sight,
loading cattle by means of their horns.
They are brought out to the ship on
lighters, ropes fastened around their
horns and the donkey engine litts
them over the side of the ship arid
lowers them into the hold. It looks
cruel, but there is no Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in
these parts.

Our next stop of interest was Lima.
We landed at Callao and from there
it is only about an hour’s ride to the
capital. As a. city it falls far below
what I had expected. The streets are
dirty, there are few large stores, and
the only beautiful part or town is out
in one small residential section. The
cafes are lively and one, The Exposi—
tion, is quite wo dcrful. Her-e tash-
ionable Lima dines, drinks and makes
merry. 1 only stayed in Lima a short
time and was glad to leave for Arica,
the ﬁrst Chilean town we could reach.

Trikes 500 Foot Leap.

You can tell the difference the min—
ute you land. The streets are clean,
the people don’t look quite so poor,
and there is some attempt at order.

,GHUWD UHAPELTWIGE
TO HEAR THE MESSIAH

Currie, Coleman, Blum and Faguy-
Cote Soloist: — Orchestra
Assists.

With four soloists and a chorus
of one hundred and ﬁfty voices accom—
panied by the College Orchestra, the ‘
annual presentation of selections from
Handel’s “Messiah" took place Sull—
]day, January 25. Audiences, which
,ﬁlled the chapel, greeted the perform-
‘ers both at the Vesper hour and in
the evening, and the music justified
the large attendance.

The results of much practice under-
the leadership of Professor George L,
Pierce were evident in tlie choruses
Sunday. For an amateur organiza—
tion, the society displayed splendid
intonation, expression and' precision.

Miss Jean Currie, soprano, Miss
Mary Coleman, Alto, Prof. Elias Blum,
Tenor and Prof. Arthur Faguy-Cote,
Bass, were the soloists. The latter
sang the i-ccitative bass “For Behold,
Darkness Shall Cover the Earth," and
the air, “The People that Walked in
Darkness." This was the ﬁrst time
that Grinnell has heard him in the
"Messiah” and his singing greatly
pleased the audience.

\Thc overture and accompaniments
were played by the orchestra assisted
by Prot. H. W. Matlack at the organ
They also played the "Pastoral Sym-
phony." interlude.

This was the twentieth perfornr
ancc of the “Messiah" in which Dr.
E. E. Harris, who plays bass viol in
the orchestra, has taken part, either
as a member of the chorus or makes
tra.
