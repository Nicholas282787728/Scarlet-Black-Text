neSSvtO make some nook of God’s
creation more fruitful, better, more

little wiser. maulier, happier and inorc‘

On our campus we have an institu-
tion of real worth which we have
been avoiding. It is our Vesber sei‘s
vice which has been avoided simply
because it was a, drudgery rattler than
an inspiration. Many times we Mr
tend, only to be disappointed with the
SVel'y day huin»druni that is conducive
to sleep. But it is our pleasure to
have witnessed ill the lost two or
more services a rapid stride to a
more beautiful and digtii ed Vespers.
To those who have contributed and
revived our worth while institution
we thank heartily, hoping they have
set a standard unencroachable as u
meditation service,

. "To make some, nook of God’s
creation more fruitful, better, more
worthy of God, to make some heart a
little wiser, maulier, happier and more
blessed, less accursed." This is OUR
VESI’ERS.
