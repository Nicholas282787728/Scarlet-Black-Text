Is any ground for complaint it might
be made on the basis that sports are
given more emphasis than the cours-
es of study on the curriculum. Wheth—
er that is true or not is largely a mat-
ter of opinion.

It does seem that college athletics
have become it matter of competitive
armament. Just as a. new battle ship

a, high priced coach in one college

keep up with rivals, cause the coach

Dr. Wetistone exaggerated hi5l
charges it he mount them to apply to

less they are Worth considerable at-
tention and will be valuable if they
cause the various colleges to keep the
situation under constant observation.
An athletic disarmament conference
might become necessary.

Deplorahle it is that Grinuell should
