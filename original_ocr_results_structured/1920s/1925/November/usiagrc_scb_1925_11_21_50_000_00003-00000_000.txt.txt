MACMILLEN, AMERICAN YIRTUDSD,
IN RECITAL HERE DECEMBER 2ND

CTT‘LICS 01' the world have arrived
at the conclusion that Francis Mac-

Milieu, the American violinist, who

plays at Herrick Chapel on chnesdoy,
is a violin virtuoso of wonderful all:

taiiinicnts. They have preferred to
say that his tcclinic is brilliant, his
tone beautiful, his interpretation the
work of a genius—the chief charm of
which is his unaflecter] sinipli ty,
It is this iiigeniousness, they sdy,
which has ever been the compelling
power of the real artist, There is no

millen is one of the greatest masters
of his time. His unusual gifts come
inand, they say, the unstinted admira—
tion of the best critics wherever he
has played.

His intonation is absolutely pure;
his taste in phrasing and recognition
of effects is truly remarkable. His
feeling of the inner content of a coin
position as well as his illuminating in»
terpretetion is much more than
merely convincing, it is captivating.

President Coolidge
Sees “Pony Express”

Sdnluel snortiidge, United states
Senator from California, has our
nonuced his plan to have a copy of
James ci-ua s epic Western, “Tile
Pony Express,” depositcd in the in

to ‘wl department of the Congre

clonal Library in Washington, D, C, l
During the mining of this fruntiel'l
spectacle, Senator Sbor idge was it
vi for on the big east at Sacramental
Caliioi-uia; which was an exact replica?
of tho city oi Sacramento as ‘it existedI
in 1860, and was so impressed with the
lllnnnel 'n which Cruze was ztttemllt~
his to record an acurate picture or
that period, that he asked to have a
special print made from the ﬁnished
negative. ,

The California senator said he in
tended to take the ﬁlm to the White
House for a special showing hcfoi-c
Pi-e. dent Coolidge, prior to having it
deposited in the Congressional Library-

"The Pony Express" is a vital,
thrilling, colorful story, laid against
the great panorama of the uncivilized
west of sixtydive years ago. Henry
James Formnn and Walter Woods
wrote it, and Betty Compscii. Ricardo
Cortez, Ernest Terrence and Wallace
Beery are the featured members in a
cast numbering several thousand plush
ers.
