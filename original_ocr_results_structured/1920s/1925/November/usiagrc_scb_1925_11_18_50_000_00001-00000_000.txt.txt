HUMANITIES GET DECISION

Audience 174pr (‘11 Ilseli 113 to 118
in Favor of Side Upheld by
Cambridge Debutcrs.

In a debate marked by its
and humor, the Cambridge university
team successfully upheld the arts and
humanities against the sciences, which
were defended by the Gi'innell men,
in Herrick chapel last Saturday night,

The decision, as rendered by the
audience, was Supposed to be an ex
pression of opinion on the question
rather than on the merits of the der
haters, although that was not gem
orally understood. it was close as
the standing vote indicates, 119 voting
for the Englishmen and us for the
Grlnuell debaters, while 76 remained
neutral on the question; Resolved,
That the future of the human race
depends more on the sciences than
on the arts and humanities. '

Michael Ramsey, Geoffrey Lloyd,
and Patrick Devlin defended the
negative for Cambridge, and James
Work, Robert Burlingamc, and Rus-
sell Smith upheld the question for
Grinnell.

Science and Art Are licedcd

In this Second international con-
t'est which has taken place on the
Grinnell campus, both Sides admitted
that the future of the human race was
dependent on both the sciences and
the arts and humanities. The question
then resolved itself into a discussion
of which of the two forces would
bring greater material happiness,
prosperity, Well-being, and progress
to the race.

The Englishmen, all of whom have
had political experience and have al-
ready debated in some twenty con—
tcsts in this country, on questions of
this type, presented a superior front
than did the local team. A classifica—
tion might be that of the visiting
team, Ramsey was the best informed,
Devlin was the best debater, and
Lloyd. was the best thinker.

Teams are Conic-est

In comparing the two teams, there
was the contrast between the English
and American type of debate. How—
ever, the Grinncll men used the Eng-
lish method to a slight extent in order
to combat their adversaries. Bur-
lingame, as the ﬁrst speaker, was in
his own field, constructive speaking;
Smith has displayed better debating
in the past; and although Work pre—
sented an excellent case, its effect
was impaired by his subdued manner
of delivery. Ramsey, captain of the
English squad. said after the debate
that the Grinneli debaters would rank
among the first three or four teams
of those they have previously met in
debating the ranking colleges and
universities in the Middle—West.

The first speaker for the affirm—
ative, Robert Burlingarne, wei-
comed the visiting Englishmen to the
Grinnell campus and then proceeded
with his constructive case. Recalling
that Cambridge has developed such
scientists as Francis Bacon, Darwin,
Newton, and that the colleges of dis
vlnity, law, physics, and mathematics
are important there, be marvelled
that there should be a repudiation of
science. He admitted the necessity
of science and the arts and human—
itles, saying that it was merely a
question on which the emphasis should
be placed. He briefly sketched the
development of science through the
ages, and then pointed out that the
purpose of science is to meet the
practical side 0! life, and in that re-
spect has become the foundation of
civilization. Science, truth, know-
ledge, and material comfort go hand
in hand; art is merely dependent on
them.

Cambridge i’rodnoos Humilitists

The supposition that Cambridge Was
Wholly scientific, began Michael Ram-
sey in refuting the affirmative point,
is a rather false assumption, because
it has produced such humanists as
Milton, Tennyson, Gray, and Macaul-
ay. He agreed that science and the
arts and humanltlesarc both import—
ant but he believed that the major
emphasis should be placed on the lat-
ter. Art is tolerant and kind to

Last year the Guild uns divided in-

but the new plan calls for socidl oc-

board made or cottage representatives
and the officers.

A Pirate party, in charge of the
new members, will be held Friday air
terubuu in the women's gymnasium.
It is the plan of the Guild to hold
parties for all college girls about once
a month. The freshmen girls, al-
though not allowed to belong to the
Tanager Guild will be invited to at-
tend all social alfail‘s.

Those in charge of the Pirate party
are Mable Moore, Katherine Kimmell,
Lois Wilson, Florence Henderson and
Vera Sterner.

In reorganizing the Guild it was
felt that since the league board dealt
with social life of both men and. wom—

take charge of social activities for
women alone.

Findlay Sponsors
Dorm Program

Vppcrclnssmcn Will be Charged with
Responsibility for Welfare and
Conduct of nulls.

Aiming at better welfare among the
men's halls, a prom‘am sponsored by
Dean James Findlay with the our
operation of the upperciassmeh of
the respective buildings, is being put
into effect.

The object of the plan, which was
adopted by the men at recent house
meetings, is to place definite respon~
sibillty for the wolfare and conduct
of the buildings. Juniors and seniors
are to he held responsibile for their
respective halls, and in turn they itre
to have authority to see that any
measures which they may take for
their own protection are enforced.
For iusmnce, breakage of building
furniture is to be charged to their
account, but if they can place the
breakage at the hands of any individ-
ual or individuals within the build-
ing, these individuals will be expected
to make it good.

This arrangement has certain def-
inite advantages over the old ar-
rangement. l-lcretoiore all breakage
of building furniture has been. taken
out on the room deposits of all men
in that building, regardless of who
was responsible. inasmuch as no
one felt any particular resonsibiiity.
breakage often became very frequent
and generally as the result of carer
lessncss.

In the cases in which building prop-
erty is damaged by persons living in
some other building, the juniors and
seniors of the damaged building may
refer the matter to tho juniors and
seniors or the other building, who are
to see that proper action is taken with
regard to these individuals. The plan
is very flexible, has no organization
except that of placing the responsibil-
ity upon the juniors and seniors, and
cooperates with, rather than dis-
places, thc house chairmen of the
respective buildings,

the most uuus -1 mill novel thins or
its kind that lJll‘s cior bccu staged for
lllc bettciuicut of love educational
institutions.

The convention was called lirilllal'r
Ily to discuss educational aims among
students, and a group of lectures by
some of America's most prominent
student lecturers furnished. the load
for thought. There were students
and facﬁlty members from practically
every institution in the state of Iowa
and also thc University of Missouri.
The total number of delegates was
estimated at about 700.

The conforencc was opened Thurs-
day with a leader's training meeting.
These sessions were lead by Dr. A.l
Bruce Curry, author of “Facing Stu-
dent Problems" and also famous as
a leader of Bible study groups.

Kelly Provokes Thought

The feature of the Friday morning
program was a lecture by Dr. Robert
L, Kelly, who aroused thought by Dell»
ing about a peculiar denominational
institution which was so autocratic
that the student body had absolutely
no voice in campus government. In

DIBBLE HALL BLIHGHES
DUHM SPEEUBALL TITLE

Building Six Snows Under Sinitli Hall
‘23 to 3 mill Ends Season with
No Defeats on Record.

By running wild over Smith hall last
evening D‘ihblc clinched her second
consecutive speedball championship.
The score of 23 to 3 clearly showed
the superiority of the North Enders.

The offense of the Dibbleites has
been a feature of their campaign this
fall and only on two occasions were
they really forced to exert themselves.
Nicolet, Coggeshall, Burt and Moore
have been bright lights for Dib'ble
throughout the schedule and the guard-
ing of Lambly and his back line has
kept the opponents’ score down. The
secret of their success might lie in
the fact that they manage to keep the
bail in opponents‘ territory.

Last Friday Smith took another wal-
ioping at the hands of Langau, 11-2.
The. score might have been larger but
the ”Deuces" were content in playing
a safe game after the game was on ice,

Monday night Capt. “Beck" Wyatt's
aEErEgatlon handed Clark hall another
flunk with a score of 7 to 3. Three's
offense was sluggish and neither team
showed much ambition in the ﬁrst
half. The second period was morn
lively and some good team Work was
shown.

Only one more game remains on the
schedule, that ‘helng between Three
and Four.

The closeness of the games and the
good sportsmanship shown throughout
the season have marked the popularity
of spceu‘ball as an inter-dorm sport.
Much credit is being given Manager
Bauerbacii who has been on the job
faithfully and has handled the tourna-
ment in an efficient manner.

Henry Crane, Mr. Crane was a very
Dopulztr lecturer and seemed to take
the conference by storm. The Sun-
day afternoon session consisted of
testimonies as to the benefit of the
convention and a general summary
of its accomplishments._

One of the roost valuable features
of the conference were the discus-
sion groups held about twice each
day to digest that which was said in
the lectures. These groups consists
ed of about twenty people each.

Grinnell Delegates Pleased

The Grinnell delegation, composed
of about twenty men and fifteen wom-
en all report the convenucn well
worth while, Ralph Smiley says,
“The State Student Conference shoWA
ed that students are beginning to
realize the distinctive problems which
they are facing in the higher educa-
tional institutions of America. They
are beginning to apply to these prob-
lems remedies which are based on
Christian principles and careful think—
ing."

Deon Findlay says, “It was a most
unusual conference, the discussions
being from the students instead of
directed to them. both the technique
and the practicalncss of the conven—
tion may be contributed to the stu-
dents themselves"

Robert Berry says, "When a group
of college students gathered together
from all ports of the state for dis-
cussion of mmpus and world prob—
lems, meet with serious intent, the
results must be beneficial. Under
the able guidance of such men as
Stitt Wilson, Dr. Kelly, and Dr. Curry
such results were obtained from the
conference in Des Monies."

Harvey Reid a delegate at the con»
vention said, “The success of the con-
ference seemed to me to lie in the
excellent men who appeared at the
regular meetings, notably Dr. Kelly.
The conference would be much more
effective if more members of the fac-
ulty and administration would alt»
tend. For the most part the people
who attend the conference are not
the ones who ‘run things at home.
As a result I do not believe that the
most vital work of the conference will
reflect itself in our college and uni-
versity life as completely as it would
if these leaders of student opinion
and the powers that he would attend
the conference as well as the rank
and file of the student body."

A neat twentyAfive yard place kick
by Meeter late in the third quarter,
gave the Pioneers three points and
victory over the Kansas Jayhawkers
on the local field Saturday. Both
elevens resorted to straight foot-_
hall and except for Meeter's success-
ful place kick, neither eleven threat-
ened seriously to score at any time.
Anderson of Kansas attempted a, drop
kick in the first quarter but Marlin
rushed in, blocking the kick and re-
covering for Grinnell.

Heater Best Ground Gainer

Meeter, who replaced Moi-an at
halfback in the second quarter, prov-
ed, the most consistent ground gainer
of the contest, getting away several
times for substantial gains. At the
close of the game he enthused the
crowd with a pretty eighteen yard,
sprint around right end.

Martin and Davis again proved the

assertion that they can hold their own

with any opposition which faces them

this year. Martin always plays down

on punts and the kickoffs, usually

nailing the runner in his tracks.
Wing Stars at Fullback

Wing played a great game'at full-
back, never failing to gain and aver-
aging nearly three yards to each line
buck. on the defense, he showed up
in wonderful style, breaking through
the smlwart Kansas line several times
to throw the hacks for material loss»
es. Mayer handled the pivot position
in nice shape especially in the second
half.

For the Jayhawkers, Hart and Zn-
ber bore the brunt of the attack. Hart
went through the Pioneer forward
wall for big gains the first half but
failed to sustain his consistency in
the second period. Zuber, who has
been on the sidelines most of the sea-
son with a broken collar bone, dis-
played some of the mettle which prob-
ably would havc won an all-vaney
ranking for him had he played in the
previous contests,

Present Powerful Line

The whole Jayhawk line, famous

for its stone wall defense near its
own 19 yard line, lived up to pre-
dictions for the Pioneers were unable
to advance the pigskin with any reg-
ularity when néar the Crimson and
Blue goal line. Vcights, Baker and
Davidson stood out noticeably in the
play of the invading forwards.
,The first half resolved itself into a
punting duel hctween Moran and
Master of Grinnell and Anderson of
Kansas. Kansas gained more con—
sistcntiy through the line but Grin-
nell’s punts were better, consequent-
ly keeping the play in mid»fielrl most
of the time. Kansas advanced the
hall close enough to attempt the drop
kick in the first huartcr but the cf-
fort was weak and the try blocked.

Pioneers Stranger in Second unit

Grinnell seemed a rejuvenated
eleven the third quarter for the rio—
necrs mnctloncd with a precision and
drive in attack which the aggregation
from the Sunflower state could not
fathom. Meeter’s punts were usually
good for about fifty yards and the
Jayhawkers turned to a defensive
game until the score was against
them. Then they unlashcd an aerial
assault which temporarily baffled the
Pioneer secondary defense. Several
intercepted passes proved fatal how—
cvcr, and the Scarlet and Black grid-
stcrs had the invaders on the deien4
sive as the game ended.
