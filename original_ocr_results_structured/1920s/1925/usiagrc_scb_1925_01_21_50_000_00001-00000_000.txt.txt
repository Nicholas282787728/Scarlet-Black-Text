popular nature. In Spite of lhéﬂ.
fact there was (I marked improvement
in many whys. The orchestra which
tonslsts of fifty-four pieces is the
largest it has ever been and will.) the
exception of a second flute forms a.
complete symphony orchestra. Ull—
douhledly the striog’seclion was the
most responsive and did the mum at»

“Death Bf Ase." The (hailing in this
number and the breadth of (one in the
climax were remarkable (Ind (borough-

to be regretted tllat those numbers,

It has not been the purpose of thol
writer to give fulsomc praise or to
stress the loss imprcs e parts of the
program. No organization composed
largely of students could he porfcct,l
but the fact that this organization has
continued to grow in numbers and in
ability to produce effectively some of;
the host orchestral compositions is!
most commendable.

The complete program included:

Wedding hlarch from ”Midsummer

Artlsts’ Life Waltzes (Stl'ass).

by two speakers at the meeting of tho

Jones gave a background for the fol-
lowing speaker by telling of the devel»
opmcnt of Egypt from the time of its
colonization until 1922. Junior Wood
took up the discussion at this point,
covering in his talk the assassination
of Sir Stack, the sirdar, and the re—

WITHIN LAST THREE MONTHS.

Bank’s All-l 1's NOW ill Cllux‘g’e ol' Smite
honking Dcpiulllmellt—Attemllt
'l‘o Room-inure Soon.

Fur the second time in three months
a local bank has become insolvent and
has been forced to close its doors. The
Grinnell Savings Bank, organized in
um and the oldest bank in the city.
was forced to close Tuesday morning,
just hetero noon. The Moi-chants Na-
tional, the first bank to fail, closed on
November 1, 192-1 on aconnt of a con-
sircrahlc quantity of its paper being
adjudged by a federal examiner as
insuliicicnt collateral. The city of
Gl'innell is apparently large enough
to support two banks comfortably, and
while as yet the officials of the Grin—
noll Savings Bank have refused to
post any authm'ative statement as to
:tllc actual condition of the book, there
is a current feeling to the effect that
the bank is not badly under.

Officials of the insolvent institution
state that on account of constant with—
drawals since the closi g of the Mcl‘»
lchmit's National Bank, the Grinncll
Savings bank has been unable to mains
taill the necessary cash l'esewe, and
‘for this reason has been forced to
close. , Tho bankis now in the hands
of M. B. Schaffer of the State Bdnk~
ing Department in has hloinos, and
officials state that every effort will be
made to complete a reorganization at
like earliest possible dale.

While the studcnt body as a whole
has not been affected materially by the
insolvency of the bank, many infllvid»
uals hale lost slightly, while a few
lbm’e lost hcavy balances which they
expected to ﬁnance them through the
second semester of the school year.

The College Book Store, which used
the Savings Bank as its chief devour
ltory since the failure of the Mer-
chants' National, will be considerably
inconvenienced in regard to paying
dividends this semester. Several
campus organizations, and various
members of the faculty have lost lieuv—
ily, and it is said that the collcgc it
self had a considerable portion of its
working funds on deposit thorc,

Rumors of [he unsoundncss of the
one active bank in tho city, the Citi—
lzens‘ National. were being circulated
lTucsday morning, and that bank eXr
porienced a considerable run the same
afternoon. But Clarence A, Diehl.
representing tho nos lloincs National
Bank, the col cspoudcnt for the Citi-
zsns‘ National. drove down from Des
Moines Wednesday with some addition»
lal currency and stated that his bank
understood tho situation and was
,rcady to support the local institution
with funds and see it through.

Mn Dichl also stated that the local
hauls could be assured of aid from the
Federal Reserve Bank if it was liens
Inssary. “We know that the Citizens
( ational Eftnk is solvent and can
‘withstand any run," said Diohl, He
lfound tho situation at the bank very
‘satislactory, as doposits are coming in
to halancc and more than balonco the
,u-itlldraunls, Every indication seems
lto poillt to tho end of whatever danger
‘may have a sled ill tho condition of
tho Citizens National uank.
