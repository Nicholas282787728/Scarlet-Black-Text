"It's a great liteI
if you don’t wcalren," and now that'
the mid-semester exams are well past
and the moments of anxiety or the
vveeh preceding are fading into a
vague, unpleasant memory, there is a
tendency to allcvv
up and take their own course. Horn

ever, it might be well to throw off the

things to slack-en

spring fever long enough to ask your-
self if it is wise to weaken too soon.

Three-fourths or the college year
has elapsed, yet it has been but a.
short while, a levy days for some oi-
us, since we elbowed in the registra
tion line. Is there anything to indi—
cate that the last quarter will move
less swiftly? Now i- the psychological
moment to scan over your accomplish-
ments and endeavors of the past sev-
en months and make an estimate of
yourself, Has anything been accom-
D'llshed?

For some or us the answer is yes,
indeed, and we look over our achieve—
ments well pleased; for others or us
a review or the vvorlr thvis far reveals
a more or less regretiul laclr of hppli~
cation. Be as it may, there is no forth»
coming justification for slackening the
pace just now. The runner that
stopped to rest at the beginning or his
last lap must have been re
ed.

In these balmy days or spring when
the campus is donning its new rev.
dnre we grant there is little induce»

conceit-

 

rneirt to study. it is irard ro beep
grinding on when there seems no par»
ticiilar irccd for it. And yet we all
realize that there is worlr to be done

Let's not allow spring fever to (ler
hide us into too many cuts now, and
cheat us out or those pleasant hours
oi leisure in May and June when na-
ture iorces attention.

THE JIA'lll‘I-IJL 0F SCHOLARSHIPS

possible the advanced education that

‘othcrwlsc would be out of reach. It is

also no mean recognition 01 a college's

consider-able number- of its students

awarded these choice prizes.

In spite of the import or those good-

say‘ ”Thdnx," we notice some nervy
person has had the audacity to go up
and print on some of them ‘ 'on'ro
