(By Herold Hicks)

By downing the Pioneers 34 to 31,
Monday night, the Drake Bulldogs cx-
tended their unbroken string of cage
victories over the Scarlet and Black to
twelve games and at the same time
went in to thie with Coach Black's
drihblers for seventh place in the final
Missouri Valley standing.

The contest, which closed the sea—
son for both schools was more fiercely
contested than any played here this
year although for a while in the first
half ossie Salem's men threatened to
make it a runaway, Led by the elus—

-ive "Chuck" Everett. the Bulldogs
piled up a fourteen point lead in the
first ten minutes and the Pioneers
were never able to overcome it in
spite of a rally in the second stanza
during which the Blue and white was
outscored is to 11.

Everett and Mantz soar

Everett and lliantz, the two Bulldog
forwards were together responsible
for thirty of their team's total and
they were easily the stars of the game.
Everett was high scorer with seven-
teen points. Moran was the main cog
of the Crinnell attack with six points
counted in each period. Lamh and
Chase played strong games, garnering
two field goals each. Bage performed
in. good fashion, sinking three from

and Gelvln covered. the floor well
throughout the game, This was ‘the
final game these last three men will
ever play ‘for the Scarlet and Black.

The diminutive Drake forward. Ev-
erett, opened the scoring after a min-
ute of play and then Lawless and
llantz hit the loop while Moran and
Chase were totaling two via the tree
lane. This ended the Pioneer scoring
for ten minutes while the Bulldogs
went wild and swept the Scarlet and
Black off its feet, sinking long shots
and breaking through for easy set-ups
to run the count up to sixteen. At this

. point the Grinnell quintet came to life
and when the half ended the score

“Romeo and Juliet" is the first
Shakespearean play to he presented
by the Dramatic Club over a period of
six years. For many years profess-
ionhls have emphasized the element of
youth in the plaYT‘and for that reason
the Dramatic Club selected “Romeo
and Juliet” for its next production

Jane Cowl, in her production of
“Romeo and Juliet" which made the
longest run over attained by any
Shakespearean play (one whole seats:
on in New York find two seasons on
tour) brought out the youthful duali-
ties of thapldy. the vital. human, 1
ing things, in a manner "modernizing"
it. ,

To use Suggestive SrttIugs

A notable feature oi'the production
will be the rapid change of scenery.
Although there are sixteen scenes, the
from, curtain is lowered but it Ce
during the entire performance, and
there are no waits of lengthy duration.
The settings are perhaps more silgr
gestive than realistic but they are ef-
fective in conveying to the audience
the mood ol the play, “Simplicity" is
the keynote throughout.

The story “Romeo and Juliet” is a
story of young lovers. It is not a dry
old Shakespearean play.
