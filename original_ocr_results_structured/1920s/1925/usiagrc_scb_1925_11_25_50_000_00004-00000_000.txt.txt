ol tiic nreril (‘oltillel Paddock. one ol
the oldest journalists in the slate,
acted as toasturastcr and he i» rinly
proved to be one of the most capable
nicn tor the job the W tcr- has croi-
seen. Donald Clark, managing editor
or the MiﬂrCuntlllelIL Banker, and
George ricrrot managing editor of the
American Boy, were called upon to
. speak. Clinton '1‘) cr Brainard, head
or the litcCliri-e—liheller Syndicate
and Thompson Bul'gisr fanroiis short
story writer were the high spots or
the evening. Mr. Brainnrd told many
interesting airecdotes of his early
days as a reporter. He worked on a
paper at Cripple Creek, Colorado, in
those‘days of mining and gun-fight
ing, and it seems that a man was
lynched in one nriuiug camp tor some
misdemeanor. The paper MLEl'ain-
ard worked on celebrated the occasr
sion by a flare headline ”Jerked to
Jesus." Sulch was the journalism or
the '90s. Mr. Burgis, when asked how
he got his iourteeu false teeth, said
'. it was from ascending a thousand
feet in an aeroplane and falling
eleven hundred.

Yellow cabs were placed at the dis,
posal of the delegates during their
stay in Boulder and could he called at
any time at the wish of the conveir
tion All the delegates were enter—
tained at the various fraternities on
the campus.

Tuesday noon the \l’umen‘s Press
club entermined at a luncheon at one
of the college inns. A short program
followed this luirchcon which evel‘ye
one enjoyed immensely. One ol the
most amusing incidents or the trip
occurred at this entertainment One
of the members of the Press cluh gave
an exaggeration ot the Charleston, and
it was no slouehy interpretation for
the young lady received an ovation
that would make Al Jason swear ironr
jealousy. A hundred calls or encore
brought her hack and her second ap-
pearance surpassed the first. She
just naturally shook her-self loose
from her backbone and oosed synco—
nation from every joint The ape
plause nearly raised the roof.’ The
crowd was brought to attention he-
rore the applause had died away by
President Pierrot rapping on his
glass. Now Mr. Perrot is an impres-
sive looking roan and his arising
brought inimedate quiet. When you
could have'heard a pin drop, ML PiCr-
rot innuired in his most authertative
voice “Is it the will of this convention
that the last set of motions stand 51137
proved."

Tuesday night a '49er ball was give
err by the Colorado Chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi. The local boys had even
gone so tar as to get dates tor all the
delegates with the best looking girls
on the campus. Judging from the
number of delegates who are going to
attend summer school at the U‘nlverr
sity of Colorado next summer, the
party may be judged a success. Eith-
er the Colorado co-eds are a hunch ot
good looking girls or the committees
used very rare judgement, tor the
“knockouts" averaged 99 99/100%

Five important clashes will occur
among Valley teams Thanksgiving
day. Crinnell meets Washington, at
st, Louis, Kansas Aggies play Ames.
Oklahoma eiicoiurters their ancient
rivals, the Oklahoma Aggies, Drake
travels to Dallas Texas to meet the-
soutliern Methodists iii an important
inter-sectional clash, and Nebraska
combats conch Rockne’s Irish, ,

A Pioneer victory on Turkey day
will give them undisputed claim to
second place in the Conference stands
ing provided the Kansas Aggies
triumph over the Cyclones. Accord»
ing to dope Coach Hvlund's nren
ought to crnslr the Piker while the
Kansas Aggios have an even chance
to down the Cyclones.

A revived Kansas eleven, stung by
defeats at the hands or five Valley o -
ponents, rose to the height ot its
power last Saturday, iiy snatchiug a
10 to 7 i-letoiy from the Missouri Tig-
ers. A lield goal by Wall in the
last twenty seconds or play proved to
be the margin of the Jayhawker’s
win. The Bengal loss did not roh
thein of the Conference champion-
ship as they won on the nerecentage
oasis.

Ames again proved to be the stumb-
ling block for the Drake Bulldogs and
spoiled the Blue and White’s chances
lor the Valley title. The Cyclones
won 7 to 6, Drake scoring their six
