His present organization consists of.
both string and woodwind parts, there
heing one instrument to each part and
a total of twelve. The artists are
men of the highest ealihre, most of
them being memhcrs’of the New York
Symphony orchestra. George Engle,
who acts as Barrel-e's manager, isI
likewise manager of the New
Symphony.

Tile pro ams presented by the com-
pany are of a dual nature, and include
both the chamber symphonies of
Haydn and other masters, and var—
ious arrangements. The tonal quah ,
is iinished and delicate. and no mas
ive effects are attempted. The pop—
ularitvlof Earrere’s orchestra is at-
tested by the fact that it gives six or
eight concerts yearly in New York and
is never able to accommodate all who
seek admission.

FRIDAY

Professor Charles N. Smiley presid-
ed at chapel Friday, at which til-ire
Dr, Evan S. Evans spoke on “Educa-
tion."

Dr. Evans deﬁned education
of things," but rather a Process of
learning how to learn. He believed
that it didn't make so much difference
Whether one whctted his brain against
Greek, mathematics, chemistry or one

York-’nomics, so long as he got the inclina—i
ition to learn. It followed from this}
[that education is not an achievernentl

but a technique.

The chief aims of education are.
first, getting an acquaintance with
natural laws and forces, including all
things which have to do with human
activity; second, the power of adapt-
ing one's self to his environment;
third, the acquisition of seit~coutroL

Dr. Evans chastised those whom he
termed "willful thinkers." He includ-
ed in that category "blatant savsuis,
dllletante philosophers, politicians
and demagogues," who believe they
can attain a distant peak by disre-
garding every intervening obstacle. I
