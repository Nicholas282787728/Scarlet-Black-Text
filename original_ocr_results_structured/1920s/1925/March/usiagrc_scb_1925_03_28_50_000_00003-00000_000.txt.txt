He has xlublished only nine books as‘

has the man who appears second,
Harold Bel-l Wright From the rating
given Wright’s books on the current
book lists, it appears that his popular
ity is on the wane.

Booth Tarkington, who appears
third in the popularity list presents
an. interesting case. The publication
of "The Gentleman from Indiana" and
"Monsieur heaucaire" in 1900 placed
him fourth in the list from whence he
