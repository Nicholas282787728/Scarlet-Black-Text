ed the greatest number of men on the
albstar basketball teams chosen from
the best performers in the recent in—
ter-dormitory cage series. The chains
pionsliip Dibble squad was awarded
seven places on the mythical fives
while Clark and Three received three
berths each.

Sweet and McClain were credited as
being the two best forwards of the
A teams. W.'Jones of L‘angan was
second high scorer but his floor work
was not on a par with Sweet’s so he
was placed on the second ouintet.
Nihlo was generally considered the
best center of the A sounds although
Bradstreet is about as good. Martin
(Langan) was the only outstanding A
'ELJM'd with Rose, Wolfe and Stotts be-
ing the next best. Rose was never
brilliant but he playedasteady game
and held opposing forwards to low
scores so he deserves a first team
berth. Wolfe played forwsi ,center,
and guard, and on account of his floor
playing and scoring ability could not
b kept off the all—star aggregation.

‘Building Six and Five monopolized
the positions on the first 3 team. June
and Patton. who ranked third and
fourth in the scoring ‘column were
placed at forwards in preference to
Struble of Four and P. Gould of Smith.
Riucfort was unquestionably the pick
of the la centers. The guard position
was more difficult as Locke and Duke
are very little better than Catbcart
and Macy. Had ltfncy played in more
«games he might have made the first
team. ' ill

with two baskets by Niess and one

With Seago and Cox, the diminutive

four free throws. Coach Black tried
several men in different positions but
was unable to iind a combination

clc is Professor Lavell's editorial “d

sesscs the intrinsic value of certain

story is trivial but the setting and
characters are aptly pomayed. “Sweet

of unlikely coincidences, as meaning-
less as the name itself. 'Graeme's

are mature and well formed individ-
ualistic expressions. The other poetry
serves to fill up space.

The Dramatic club has definitely (lei
cidcd to give thc play in the high
school auditorium on March 23, This
has been necessitated by the character
of the play which delllzulds open
street fighting and a wide stage, as
well as better lighting equipment.

One of the distinct features of the
play will be impressionistic scenery.
Sixteen scenes with nine complete
changes of setting will relieve any
possible monotony of atmosphere.
This will be a greater feature than
the Dramatic club has ever attempted
in past years.

The Pioneer cugcrs meet one of the
strongest tennis in the Valley when
they play hosts to the Nebraska quill-
tct here Tuesday night. The Corn-
huskcrs are now in third place in
Valley ratings, being headed by Kan-
so: and Washington.

Ncbrnska recently played Ames, de~
fcating them 37 to 15. Tonight they
meet the strong Creighton five and
this game will give a more direct line
on their strcngth as the Hilltoppcrs
have a particularly strong team this
year.

in Tipton, forward, Goodson, center.
and Volz at guard, the Ccrnhuskers
stand out in an offensive attack and
o defensive strength which is hardly
betLel'ed in the Valley. The fact that
they have held Kansas to two close
scores and have two wins to their
credit over Oklahoma, indicates some-
thing of the strength of the team
which the Pioneers will tackle Tues-

'day night.

Coach Black has been trying several
combinations in an effort to get, an
effective Scaring machlne. The com-
bination of Winter and Moran, for—
wards, Eoge. center, and Galvin and
“7ng guards, Will probably start al-
though it is possible that either Lamb,
Chase, or Dcffing will be at either of
the forward positions. Winter is es
sentlally a guard and possibly will re—
turn to his old position in this game.

Minus the services of its captain
and star hurdler, Morgan Taylor, a
Grinncll track team of four men coup
peted today in the illinois indoor relay
carnival at Urbana.

Floyd Green in the hurdles, Kitchen
in the 300 yard dash, and Mecter and
Rinefort in the shotput -\vel‘e the Mul-
tcase cross wearers that Coach Huff
entered in the big meet this afternoon.
The Pioneer chances of winning points
were considerably dimmed when it
was announced that scholastic diffi-
culties would keep Taylor at home.
but Green was expected to make a
good showing in the sticks in spite of
the fact that he would be competing
against Dan Kinsey, joint holder of
the world's record in the 75 yard
highs, Guthrie of ohio, Coulier of
iowa, and other men of such caliber.

roster Rinefort, the big weight hea—
ver. has been on the sick list for the
last week and was barely able to make
the trip, so he could not be counted on
to get the distance on his shot puts
that he usually does, Cordon Kite
chen is capable of fast time in the 300
yard event but with the opposition en~
tered in the race his chances of place
illg are not VSTY great.

The lllmois relays drew over. 700
athletes from sixty-three institu-
tions scattered over the United States.
Over a hundred relays were run off
in the college and university sections
and no doubt many of the long stand-
ing records in those events were shot-
tered judging from the previous per-
formances of some of the quartets sn-
tered. The mile relay which is
always one of the central attractions
of the meet probably brought to light
a new champion this year. The lowa
team which has won the event for
three years was not considered strong
this spring. as Coultcr is the only vets
cran quarter milev left in school, and
the fastest new material is either sick
or ineligible at the present time.

lllleieiiing linen Forum
Held Alter Knilx Debate

A spililed open forum followed an
interesting debate bctwcen Knox and
Crinncll last evening on the proposr
tion, "unsolved—that Congress should
be empowered to over~l‘ide by a two
thirds vote, decisions of the Supreme
Court which declare acts of Congress
unconstiultiounl.” In the debate
proper, Knox upheld the affirmative,
and was represented by Robert Kyle,
Lucien Field. and Clyde Varner.
Grinnell upheld the negative and was
represented by Robert Burlingame.
Russell Smith, and Loren Reid.

Mr. Field, opening the debate for
the affirmative, stressed the need for
an easier way of_ amending the con-
stitution, and offered the affirmative
proposal as a means of doing this.
For the negative. Mr. Burlingnme de-
nied that the proposal of the affirm-
ative was as simple as it appeared,
and contended that the proposition
would destroy the fundamental basis
of our government. His speaking
was very effective.

Mr. Smith, speaking second for
Griuucll made 33» excellent impression
in showing the disosterous results of
the affirmative proposal, and denying
the need for such a change. The last
Grinnell speaker, Mr. Reid, balanced
the two cases well. and pointed out
the inadequacy of the affirmative

 

proof.
