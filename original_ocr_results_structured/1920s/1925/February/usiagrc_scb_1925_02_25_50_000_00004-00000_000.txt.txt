“My (llld students. And the provision
for representation of town students is
number valuable asset, However, it
seems to me that the policy or con-
lining student representation to Sen-
iors is zl Very unfortunate one, The
increment for student government is
based, 1 heliera on the idea that stil-
(lents from the ve .' nature of the case,
have a hotter understanding of what
their problems are, than faculty mem»
hers can llzll'e, Furthermore it lllilinr
thins that responsibility cultivates
drought and inspires n desire to roster
the best interests oi the college. And
iinallr, it is hosed on the old theory
oi representation for the governed.
Have we not defeated our aims when
we admit into our college student
government, Seniors only? Willie
doubtless Senior judgment is more de-
pendable than Freshman, certainly
Fnculty judgment should
than Senior. Yet no one would :Ldvo-
cate a return to the old system oi fac»
ulty dictatorship. And would not the
lower classmen have more respect tor
the rulings oi a council on which they
were representedi A caste system cs.
tahlishing a hierarchy of students is
more dangerous than a hierarchy or
faculty could ever be. To paraphrase
the old quotation,

”Four years do not a. wise man
make

Nor can and gown, a. sage!"

Editor Scarlet dc Black:

Last Monday I was in the Book

Store and overheard the conversation
'of two men concerning a certain
lzaak Walton placard that in posted in
a. prominent place in the store. One
or them laughingly reierredtolt as an-
other “Humane Society," and the oth-
er said that “it would create a lot
or merriment around school." Na-
tnrally 1 was interested because I was
the one who put it up.

The iirst ieliow hit the nail on the
head when he said it was at "Humane
Society." It is, but that name does't
need to call iorth shadows or teas
and sewing polities. The izaak wal-
ton Leazue is an organization or

at its head as Zane Grey, Dr. Henry
Van Dyke, James Oliver Curwood,
Donald Hough, Will H. Dilg and oth-
ers.
a few years high to right the slaughter
of American wild lite. Their letter-

healls rend “Defender of Woods, Watt» g

are and Wild Life," and to this end
they have made noteworthy advances.
The membership numbers something
over 100,000 and is gaining steadily
The League attempted three gresi
drives in 1924. One was a. fight
ngzti draining the marshes or the
upper Mississippi, which is the biggest
breeding ground for wild fowl inthis
country, They carried this fight iue
to Congre s and won a victory. The
second project was against the pol-
lution of the waters of the Illinois
River whichwhs killing vast numbers
or game tish. This light was carried
into the Illinois courts and the re-
sult was entirely successtul. The
third and greatest light began late
last year and it is, in my opinion, the
most important or the three. It is a
fight to shve the last great stand of
Elk in America from being wiped out.

If any of you know Wyoming. you
know that the Jackson Hole is the big-

’hy Donald Hougll, which you shoulrl
read.

To come back to the placard in the
Book Store and the “Humane Society”.
There are just two things that will
save the American Elk. One is hay
and one is protection from the thrill
hunter and the tooth hunter. The
Izaak W'alton League has tackled both
of these problems. There is a fight
on in Congress, or will be shortly, to
buy the Jackson Hole Country and
turn it into a huge Game Reserve.
That's the first thing. The second
thing is to buy all the hay land 01 the
Valley and thus assure the herds feed
forever. You can't help on the first
problem but you can on the second.
The League is uttemptlng to raise
$100.00 for the purchase of the hay
lands in the Snake River Valley. The
placard 1n the Book Store has a llttle
box attached with a. slot in the top.
Go to it!
