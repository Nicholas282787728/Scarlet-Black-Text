About a week ago siv large packs
ages and one small one, all bearing
Austrian postrna , arrived at the
botany laborator and upon being
opened were found to contain'a nrar—
\eloils colectiou of the flora or that
countrr And ther-chy hangs on in-l
terestins tale.

It was in the day just tollowing
ihc nor-id war that ProlesSOl Collard
chanced tu read or the peculiar af-
lliciions of a certain noted Austrian
botanist, Dr. Anton Hciuierl of vienna.
Dr. Heimerl. who had for years eue
joyed the distinction or being one of
the ioremost botanists or Europe, the
author-of an important school or ilora

of Austria. joint author or a botany oils leads the list which includes Moi— tee of the Advismy Bomd consisting

text and a much solicited contributor
to scientific journals, was reduced to
absolute penury during the aftermath
or the war. Deprived of his only means
or earning a decent livelihood, and.
his pension of three million kronen,
suspended by the government, he and
his family barely found existence in
the crowded quarters of poverty
stricken Vienna. This was the cond
tion in which a letter from Mr. Cunr
srd found one of the best known Sci~
entists of Europe. it subsequently
developed that only through aid froml
the Near East Relief and the Friends
Service wel'e‘they able to keep alive.
in his letter to the Austrian botans.
ist Professor Cunard enclosed ten d'ol-
lars with the request that he engage a
student to gather some Austrim flora
for the Grinuell laboratory. As was
hoped, Mr. Heimerl undertook the
work himseli and after some time a
wonderiul assortment or plants was
received from him, That was over a
year ago. .

In correspondence with Mr. Con-
.ord, the Austrian professor told oi the
awful state of aiiairs in his own
country. Neither he. nor his wiie and
tiny daughter, had been outside of the
city ior o'ver a year and the destitu-
tion was rapidly telling on the little
girl, in particular. The advantages
which that ten dollars attorded are
hardly to be conceived by a well fed
American. Dr. Helmerl, with his wife
and daughter were immediately en-
abled to move to the country where
the child became healthy again and
the protessor could find time to nor-
sue his studies in botanical research.
During the summer he collected such
a variety of plants as Mr. Canard had
never dreamed oi, and, having sent
them over here, still ieit he had not
expressed his gratitude. This collec—
tion arrived in the fall oi 1923 and
contained over 500 different species,
some exceedingly rare and almost un—
replaceable.

The large collection of plants which
arrived recently is a further expres<
sion of the man’s gratitude and was
unsolicited as well as unexpected. In
it are numerous specimens gathered
from the Alpine mountain regions. Mr.
Heimerl also writes that, thanks to the
gift which provided uecessiti s for
sereral months ior his family they
are now again living in comfort and
best or health.

Needless to say, the correspondence
has been an interesting experience
for Professor Cunard and he ieels that
this ten dollars was the best invest-
ment and gift he ever made: He plans
in the neftr future to sort over his
enormous herbariuru and out of the
duplicates send Mr. Heime‘rl between
a thousand and eleven hundred oi the
plants most common to this part or
the United States, Shipment or plants
