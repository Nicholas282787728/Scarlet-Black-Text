Tuesday

At chapel, Tuesday morning, Profes-
sor .l. D. Stoops iloyed the common
conception that unhappiness is always
connocled with work. Work, he af—
ﬁrmed, is a curse only when we can
not put into it our soul, our ieelings,
heart, and emotions. The idea that
money is the only, or even the min
motive of work, belongs to social de-
velopment in the ﬁeld or economics,
and the feeling that the central, dom-
inating motive in liie must be money
proﬁt is far iron the truth. Surely
Michaelangelo with his creative zeal
and his ﬁery imagination dld not Work
with the inspiration of a pecuniary re-
ward. In conclusion, he avowed that
our aim should be to lind out through
sou-discovery and experimentation,
into what kind or a his we can put the
richest, deepest and happiest qualities
of our souls—our real life, arid to 311*

‘ ply ourselves accordingly.
