White and Lewis Earn
Money by New Method

A rather unique method or earning
college expense money has been ad-
opted hy Gaylord \Vlllte '23, and Val»
don Lcwis, ’28, both residents of
Building Four, who are promoting ct
program of unto rdces at. the Jasper
county ruir ground, in Newton/ on
Memorial Day. Lewis and White are
otiering purses which aggregate over
$500 ior two races. one oi titty mile
length and the other or twenty miles.
They promise inst action, because the
truck has been worked all winter nod
entries are expected from some of
the most experienced and best known
drivers in this port or the country.
Whiteihes had considerable exper~
ieuce in promotion work or this kind
and. granted good weather, the event
should draw heavily on Decoration
Day.
