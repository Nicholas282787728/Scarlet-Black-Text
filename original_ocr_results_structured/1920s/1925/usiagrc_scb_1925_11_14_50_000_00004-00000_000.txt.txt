Dope Fm’ors Pioneers

Another important Valley tilt will
be the GrinnelHKausilS battle at
Grinnell, with the dupe favoring the
Pioneers to come out with the long
end of the score. Last Week both
teams played tie games with their re-
spective opponents, Kansas holding
the Sooner: scoreless, While Grlnnell
and Andes finished with a. count of
nine all.

in the Jayhawkvsouner fray, Okla~
home carried the hall to Kansas’ one-
yard line three times during the first
half only to lose the boil on downs.
This perfaramhee shows that the
szbawk line is one of the most pow-
erful forward wells‘in the Confer-
enoe.

Grlnnell outfought the heavy Cy-
clone grldsters last Saturday and af-
ter Allies had rolled up nine points in
the first half came right back in the(
third quarter and tied the score. The
impressive showing of the Pioneers
in this game marks them as one of
the strongest teams in the Valley.

The setting of the new Victor

"A Son of His Father," adapted for
the screen by Anthony Coldewey
from Harold Bell Wright's best sell-
ing novel by that name, is the fas-
cinating one of the changing west
as it noticeably shifts in the brief
lapse of time between father and son.

Bessie Love, Warner Baxter and
Raymond ﬂatten are featured in the
cost of the production, a stirring tale
of the Arizona border with the plot
woven around a band of cattle smug—
glers that is over-running the state.
