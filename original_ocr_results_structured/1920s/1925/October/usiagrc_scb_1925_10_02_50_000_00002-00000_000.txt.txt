It one body can be organized, whose
sole purpose is to foster forensics and
furnish actual practice, it ought to
be \igorous and valuable. Just what
the nature of that body will be, is up
to the men now in school to at. least
partially determine, It might be an
open forum of the Oxford Union type,
it might exist merely as an ordinary
club, or there is a possibility or ob-
taming :t charter or one oi the ne-
