pected to be closer this fall. ’

letics has been organized under the
direction of 1-1, I. Huff and Lester
Duke who have recognized the need
for further expansion in the field to
keep pace with other colleges and
universities in thcir efforts to give
every man a chance to take part in
sports. In its new venture the de-
partment asks for tho cooperation of
the student body to off set the lim-
ited iacilities and equipment.

The following program has been
drawn up and passed by the Men's
Senate and is now presented to the
student body. Intramural athletics
will be divided into three periods;
fall, winter, and spring.

Disillusioned ‘Vetverans Ridicule
“World Made Safe For Democracy”

An Interview With Louis Wolhein'l

liy Emil liillmrz
[Editor's l'oLc—

An event unprcccndented in
theatrical history was thc bring—
ing oi the sensational \\1l|‘ play,
“What Price Glory" direct from
New York to Omaha for Legion
Convention Week. It was the
purposa of the producers of the
play to present this disillusionin:
picture of the World war to the
men who fought it, and to regis—
ter thcir reaction before taking
the play on tour. Thc Dramatic
editor of the Scarlet and Black
was the guest of the management
of “What Price Glory" last Sat-
urday. and this interview was
obtained at that time “What Price
Glory" will be presented in Obie
cago at the Studebaker theatre
for the remainder of this season]
"They ridiculed the idea of
world salc for dcmocmcy'.”

Thus Louis Wolneihl, star of "What
‘Price Glory,” eptitoniized the reaction
of the twenty thousand World War
veterans who were estimated to have
witnessed the Stalllngs»Alidcrsoll play
in Omaha last week.

llcist, speaking Saturday night at
IIellick chapel.

“lVlly in this country have I not
heard It note DI protest from six year

to the French war against the Ritfs
of Morocco in which he said at peace-
ful llomelilie people were being bombv
ed and torn from llmb to limb be-
cause they Wanted to live ill their
own country.

The Rifﬂnn \vfu‘ wits only one ex»
ample to prove IJIS main [mint that
the West is greedy for power. He
said, “The main quest at Eastern Civ-
ilization has been for things material
to the utter ignoring of the finer val-
ues of life."

War Is Result

"autthroat competition," he termed
the motto of European nations, as he
strove to indict Western nations for
their actions in the 500 years during
which they have had a. civilization of
their own, “The spiritual culmina-
Lion of this policy," he pointed out,
“is shown in the last year in which
10,000,000 young men lost their lives."
In contrast to this, he said [lie na-
tions ol the East have never, in their
history of 5000 years, hftd Such a
catnstl‘OlﬂJe.

Belol'e coming to the main thesis
of his address, in which he spoke of
the need of spiritual values and cut-
'iure as more essential to real life
than Western materialization, Has—
sain explained the place the East had
had in the world and attempted to
clear up some DI the false notions
about it. He brought out that the
East is a. unit stretching from Japan
on the Pacific to Morocco on the At-
lantic. He mentioned Columbus’
search for India and said, “Consider-
ing that you were discovered because
of India, the least you call (ll) now is
to set out to discover India for your—
self."

written in three nights in the Public
Library of New York City and only
a month later Anderson and Stallings
found tlicmselves famous while “What
Price Glory” was universally acclaim-
ed as the most effective and thorough-
ly devastating picture of the World
War that had yet been presented.
Mr. Wolheim, who originated the
role of “Yank" in Eugene O'Neil's
"The Hairy Ape," has played the role

. of the hard-boiled Captain Flagg in

“What Price Glory" over four hun<
dred times, and intends to continue in
the role until the play is taken to
Million in 1927.

He found the legiouaires the most
appreciative and vociferously enthus-
iitstic audience to which he has ever
played,

“The men who fought the war real»

stated.

“1 could leel, in playing before

urday, only to let the Gophers score

and get the long end of a 344% count.
The scoring orgy of the northerners
was due mainly to the strength of
their reserves and the absence of Mhs
ran and Sweet from the Grinnell line-
up on account of injuries.

Expecting to win by a top heavy
score the Minnesotans were given the
suri ise of their life when they en-
countered the stubborn opposition at
the hands of Hyland's men. Not only
did the Grinncll team fight like a dc-
inon but it displayed a fast charging
line and a backfield that displayed a
versatility of attack. being able to
gain consistently through the Gopher
forward wall or skirt the ends for
needed yardage. The score does not
indicato the closeness of the battle,
nor need the Pioneers feel disgraced
at their defeat. Minnesota sent a
team on the field that would do hon—

iIoruu Thrills

iIoran thrilled the 15,000 spectators
who througed the mammoth stadium
when hc scooped up Cooper’s opening
kickoff and raced past the entire
Minnesota team for a touchdown. It
was a wonderful exhibition of oilen/
field running for after shaking off

or Minnesota’s secondary defense,
Moran then, with the aid of splendid
interference, eluded the Minnesota
safety man and crossed the goal line.
He failed to kick goal after the
touchdown.

A poor punt paved the way for
Minnesota's first touchdown in the
'opening quarter. The Gophers worked
’tlle ball down the field to the Pio-
neer's four yard line by line plunges
and end runs. Then with a touch
down within their grasp, locating,
Minnesota's human battering ram,
fumbled on Grihhell's three yard line
and Seeland recovered.

0n the next play Moran booted the
ball out of bounds on Grinnell’s thirty
yard line and it was from this point
that the Gophers started their march
which ended in a touchdown. They
quickly rushed the hall down to Grin-
hell's two yard line, where Joesting
crashed over for a touchdown. Pep-
law kicked goal giving them a one
point lead.

Minnesota scored her second touch-
down eariy in the second quarter.
Sparkling end runs by Graham and
short dashes through the line by
Joesting again placed the ball five
'yards from the Grinnell goal line.
From here only two plunges were
needed to put the ball over. Nydojil
kicked goal.

Grinuoll Thrcotcns Again ,

Grinhell threatened to score again
soon after Minnesota's second touch
down. Minnesota punted to the Pio-
neer’s twentrseven yard line from
which point Meeter, Moran and Wing»
by dint of some hard thrusts at the
line placed the ball on Minnesota's
thirty-five yard line. A pass to Stotta
gained ten yards, Gl'lhnell than fum-
bled on the twenty yard line and Mina
ncsota recovered, The northerner-
were offside and the ball was given
back to Grinnell and Minnesota pen-
alized livc yards. Moran then made
first down on Minnesota's thlrteen
yard line. locating then played the
mic of hero by intercepting a for-
ward pass and dashing as far as his

was forced out of bounds. The half
