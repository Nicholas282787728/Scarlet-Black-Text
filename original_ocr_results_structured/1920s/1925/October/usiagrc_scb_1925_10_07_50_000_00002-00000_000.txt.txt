The foundation of the text lies in
an ancient lllmbelllldll nirtli which

was a hero in one section of the war
and as a natural sequence iimm' and;

come into his own by llccolllillg a he-

As I have sltid, Paul Bunyan was a
hero, but unlike most heroes he \vasl
very versatile. He was a philosopher,
mildly, still a philosopher. He was a
llulilallital'idll oi considerable depth.

to turn off the supply and wasted

The book is not entirely comic lir,
