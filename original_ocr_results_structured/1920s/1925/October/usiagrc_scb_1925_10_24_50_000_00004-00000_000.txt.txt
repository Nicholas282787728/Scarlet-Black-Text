Appearing before a homecoming
audience which filled llerrick chapel
to capacity. Louis Gravcure, the well—
known French baritone, opened Grin-
Hell’s 192571 28 recital season last
evening. The presence of so many
visitors doubtless accounted iu sonicI
degree [or the enthusiasm with which
he was received, although in any on I
his dramatic personal‘ , and coin,

him instant favor.

The program consisted of

power was revealed to the fullest, and i
it expressed itself most powerfully in
a song which breathed the atmos

"Flow thou regal, purple stream!"
The artist's wide range of touch and,
keen appreciation of musical i-alnesl

Mr. Gl'aveure desei-ies praise for
the discrimination which he showed
in arranging a well—balanced program
that was neither so classical as to be ‘

“modern" as to compete with the ra-
dio. This fact, and his delightful per—
sonality, made the recital a fitting‘
part at the homecoming program.
