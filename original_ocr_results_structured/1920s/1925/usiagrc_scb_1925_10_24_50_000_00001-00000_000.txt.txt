The clash on Ward Field this after—
noon between Drake and Grinnell
will mark the opening of the valley
schedule for the Pioneers and will be
the third conference game for the
Bulldogs. It will also he the contilr
ning of a thirty—two year old feud in
which the two institutions have

fought on practically even terms,
Both squads have bcen pointing for
today’s contest and are entering their
strongest possible lineups, Drake has
met with some reverses within the
last two weeks and has
Gl-innell with a hope of reinstating
herself. Grinnell has the memory of
numerous defects at the hands of the
Solemites and has made full prepaiu
ations to conﬁne)" the greedy Bulldog.

rirst Conference Game

Today's game marks the initial
conference game of the 'season for
eriuuell, while Drake has played
three Valley games, this being her
fourth. Drake opened the season with
a 6 to 0 Victory over the Washington
Fillers, in a game played on a muddy
field, then the strong Kansas Aggie
team was defeated at Des Moines, by
a 19 in 0 score. Last Week the U. of
Oklahoma surprised the Bulldogs by
outplnying them for a 7 to 0 victory.
\Vith this defeat fresh in their minds
the Blue and White team has sworn
revenge at the, hands of (lunch,

Grinnell started off the year with
a victory over Penn College 27 to 13.
The next week the Pioneers were
'held to 8. 3 to 3 Lie by the veteran
Cornell aggregation. 0n the follow-
ing Saturday the Scarlet and Black
bowed to Minnesota to the tune of as

on the injured list are back in uni-

neither is expected to last the whole
game.

Rivalry Keen

The intense rivalry between schools
has caused both squads to point for
this homecoming game and all ma-
terial available has bccn trained with
a view of having'plenty of reserve
strength in readiness With teams
and sidelines keyed up to the highest
point this afternoon's battle is des~
tined to be one of the hardest fought
games ever staged on Ward field.

As this marks the entrance of
Grinnell into the race for conference
honors the locals are Still more con-
earned on winning today's game. A
victory for Drake will put them hack
near the front of the Valley schools
with a percentage of .750, While a
Grinnell Win Will force Drake flown
into the .500 class, and will put the
Plan at the top with a perfect

Irene Whil' y, president of Women‘s
League Boar . “Persuasive forewords
have convinced the Grinnell Home—
comers that this is' to be the biggest
and best Homecoming Grinncll has
ever had, SD when you come back,
we hope our booster spirit will sweep
out of sight every reminder or the old
’dzlys, and make you feel a real part of
the new."

Walter Ingram, presidcnt of the
Men’s senate: “Homecoming is not
only Homecoming for the alumni but
it is a joyful event {or the students.
The men or Grinnell desire to join
with the alumni in reverence for; the
past, and they hope that thlzy will
join with us tor the Gl'illuell of the

“In the quietness or good will, in
cordiality of feeling and in tho cone
sciousness of an inspiring Icllowship
we of Grinnell welcome you all—
rriend and “Eriendly foe” allkc.

"To our oum4rinnellisns there is
the added zest of the sensc‘ of kinship
and unity which return to the old
home brings with it. It is an unseen
overflow of spirit, It can't be de~
scribed. It is too good for words. it
is over and above the game and the
play, beyond any of the -
cidente of the homecoming.
volved in it is the return in spirit to
the old days. Involved in it is the
present joy in rencwing and restoring
friendships. Involved in it is a joy-
ous look to the future in confident
assurance of a yet stronger and bet

“Gl'innelli‘Oltl Grinnell’—\vhere we

were wrought in our spirits! Where

golden moment in our lives when we
come together lrorn our various ways,
live together again in campus joys.

James Fitz of Des Moines, who

Drake students were coming to Gill-h

which booed ill ror Grinnell. Fitz
said that he did not rear thc outcome
of tomorrow's struggle as long as
Grinnell showed the spirit they were
showing.

More yells were then given in

Drake and Grinnell Rivalry Brings Crowd of
Visitors to Pioneer Campus for Grid

Afternoon.

o'clock opened the lirolsrm Wm“
will continue until 11:30 tonight. The
students carried out a. rather original
idea in thc chapel and the parade
which was held afterwa The
classes sat in sections, seniors ﬁrst,
juniors next, etc. and all or them
were arrayed in freak apparel, Sen-
ior girls wore White sweaters and
middies, and the men donned white
sweaters and waiter coats; junior
sirls carried open umbrellas and the
men of that class lolled their trous-
ers up to their knees and Wm ga-
lashes or rubbers; all the sophomores
Were slicked out in yeuow suckers;
and the fresh girls decked themselves
in red, while their male classmates
were red caps and coats turned
wrong side out. Alter mer E. W.
Norris had spoken in chapel, the stu~
dents with this unusual garb marched
downtown behind the wilege band
singing, yelling, and shouting. Con-
eluding their parade, they marched

back to the campus to witness the
freshman football contest.

Preps l’lay rwtbau

Donald :Pascne, captain of all the
freshman Squad, and Harold Van
Fossen, headed the two opposing
first year lelevens in the annual grid»
hon struggle which takes place be-
tween the preps on Homecoming day.
The squad, a collection of former
high school stars, played the game
like veterans and gave the grads an
opportunity to see the brand of foot~

hall which they can expect from Grin-
llell in future years.

Plans for the afternoon are even
more extensive than were those this
morning. The big event of the day
is the game with Drake which begins
at 2 o’clock, the gates to Ward field
being opened at 1:00. Music by the
band and the cheering will start at
1:30. o.
Faculty Chill Opens House

After the game, there' will be open
house at the dormitories and tea at
the Faculty club for all visitors. The
quadrangle cottages are all decorated
and prepared to receive visitors also.
The varsity dinner, a stag affair.
which will include both the Drake
and Grinnell football teams, is to be
at 6 o'clock in the Men’s dining room.
Morgan Taylor, chairman, has invit-
ed all men to a “Men's Reunion” in
the 'cluhroom of Building In after
dinner.

“Mr, Pilu Fasses By,” the Home-
coming play, by A. A. Milne, will be
presented by the Dramatic club lm— ‘
der the direction of “’illinm Angus in
the high school auditorium at 7:00,
instead of 8:30 as previously an-
nounced. The reason for the change
is the [act that a Homecoming dance
has been scheduled from 9:30 to 11:—
30.

All indication of the crowd is that
there are very few seals left either
[or the football game or for the
Homecoming play. It has been many
years since Griuheil has had such an
attendance for the annual Homecom—
ing. Drake appears to be well rep-
resented also and will probably fill
the east bleachers alloted to them.

, The Buildings are holding recep-
tions for their returning alumni.
Clark and Dibble Halls Will hold
smokers at 12:00 o'clock Saturday
night.

Morellouse Present

President and Mrs. D. W. Morehouse
of Drake were expected as guests of
Dean and Mrs. John S, Ngllen. Many
members of the Drake faculty as well
as students were expected to attend.
the game this afternoon. President
Morehuuse, the Drake squad and its
officials have been invited to attend
the varsity dinner at the dormitory
(lining room tonight at 6 o‘clock. Af-
ter the dinner a smoker will be held

Iiu the clubrocm or Building Three.

The special \train bringing the
Drake ruotcrs left Des Moines at 9:30

,dnd arrived in Grillnell about 11:15‘

The train will return soon after the
