Hyland and Black to
Coach Gridders Again

‘.HOPES FOR NEXT YEAR ARE
BRIGHT WITH MANY
STARS LEFT.

With the 192 5 season out of the
way, athletic talk is turning- to ilie
prospects tor next 3 or and more Dim
ticularly next fall, when the gi‘iildL‘
will attempt to duplicate or bette
their past pcrlorniances.

When "Alike" H and gave his as.
surance that hc would be back again
to direct the football squad the out-
.look grew brighter. In his one year
here, Hylaiid has succeeded in in-
stalling a neiv system of play with
marked results, as the \iclorles over
Coe, Washington and Allies testiil,
Next fall with most of the stars baclr,
and with a good schedule awaiting,
Hyland and Charley Black seem to
have everything in their favor and
Crinnell fans await the opening game
with high hopes.

Sweet Will Load

Captain Meredith Sweet, who for
:two years has been a marked man in
the Valley, will be back at his old
.pos' 'on at half back. His end runs,
voff»tdckle smashes and bullet passes
should he one of the biggest ground
gaining factors on the Pioneer eleven.
Sweet will not shine alone for "Hap"
Moi-an will be out to bear up his reps
nation which lie gained last fall by
his long runs and consistent heady
playing. Gordon Meeter, West Stone
and Harry Wins. all letter men will
be in football togs and with Car
Lamb, Hugh mum and some strong
material from this year‘s prep squad,
ought to make up one of the £astest,
hardest hitting backiields that has
been in the Conference for some time.

F The line will furnish the difliculti
if there is any but if the hole made
.by the graduation of Lester Duke, .1117
Missouri valley tackle, can be filled.
the forward wall will be able to take
‘care of anything it is liable to meet,
.although the schedule includes five
conference scraps and a Bige'l‘en
clash with Minnesota.

Peterson and Meyer are capable
centers with experience. and Cathcart
and Martin are a splendid pair of
guards, so the center of the line will
be strong. There will be no letter-
men available lor tackle positions but
Rinefort showed great promise at the
close of the season last fall and with
his size and speed will no doubt make
a great tackle. Howarth from the
varsity squad and Davis from the
yearlings are huskies of promise so
the tackle berthes may not furnish
a. very great problem. For the flanks,
McClain and Scharnwebcr will be
,available, and they will be capable of
holding down their positions in line
style.

Cagers Look Strong

Although the football season is of
more immediate concern, basketball
gossip is going the rounds. Harry
Wing will captain the team and will
be the mainstay of the defense as the
only old guard left, as a result of the
graduation of Gelvin and Winter.
Moran, nll»vzt.lley and all—state than
last year and third ranking man in
the scoring column will no doubt be
.the same star he was last winter. He
is a. wonderful floor worker, knows
Lhcgame and can hit the loop, so the
Pioneer quintet should have some
punch in its offensive. Chase is the
only other letter man but Gar Lamb
can be depended upon, and with Doi-
ting, Secland, Peterson, Smiley and
Davis, a good five can be found.

The basketball schedule has not
been announced but it is known def-

-initely that a round robin schedule
will not he played. The valley
coaches voted to do away with the old
system because the addition of Okla-
homa A. it M. to valley circles, would
necessitate playing too many games
it the round robin plan was continu-
ed.

stars on Track Squad

Although the track team will be
minus the world famed Morgan Tayr
lor it will contain some point win-
ners. Scharnweber is fast in the
sprints and the quarter and if he has
a good season out to come through

The selection of Shaw's “Arms and

iiillllc Club so. son was indeed a loi'lur
nute one We doubt if there is a
dramatist li 'ng who uses the cudgel
so cltectiiely .llr. Shaw mocks our
stupid and conventional hninbugs and
in doing SCI has it great deal of fun
mocking himself. He is much like the
excellent raconteur who amuses his
follows with a spicy talc, and then
lllughs at them for enjoying it.

Coming at the end of a year of inno—
vations in things dramatic “Arms and
the Man" displayed the resources and
abilities of the Dramatic Club men}
bars to good advantage. The elements
that make a good evening in the [her
one were there, anti in certain instan-
cs were served with a touch oi per-
sonal seasoning that is begotten only
of unusual talent. Miss Rust’s set—
tings, for example, were finely intere
brotive. The costumes were appro-
piiate and alwi s an integral part of
the stage picture. The acting was we
balanced as a whole. Lighting effects
indicated the great strides that have
been made in this direction lluring the
past year.

The acting was uniformly vi a. high
order. Fortunately members of the
cast evidenced no desire to “Star" and
as a consequence the director's sense
of proportion was never violated. In
this respect “Arms and the Man” was
superior to any production of the past
year, We Lhaughi. Miss Somel‘s liar»
ticularly good in the use of her hands.
Her role was the most diflicult from
the actor's standpoint. There is little
in nae part of Rain to arouse sip
taneous enthusiasm on the part of the
audience. Yet Miss Somers sensed
the emotional and mental charactc .
istics of her heioinc and gave a pe »
formance that was always intelligible.

Mr. Wood brought to Bluntschlicon—
siderablc dash and verve. His Captain
was real, and he was often genuinely
comic. Mr. Craven made a laughable
caricature of Sergius, which we
thought often dangerous to the am,
niatic values of the play. In spite of
a tendency to act in one key he con—
tributed several moments of dcft and
subtle playing. Mr. Work, likewise,
had some moments that were better
than others but he made of Pelkoff the
gentle buffon that Shaw intended. Mr.
Gaines, new to Grimm“ audiences,
showed in all of his playing a Sense
of restraint and an understanding of
character that placed him above the
"amateur level." Miss Gilmore stress»
ed the coarser nature of Madame Pet—
koff. We liked her best in the scenes
with the Major.

Graduating Exercises
To End Tomorrow Night

Largest Class In History of School
Will Get Their B. A.
Degrees.

“Come 'e back to old Gl'iuhell," is
a phrase which has particular Signiﬁe
caiice at present, when so many "old

ads" and lormcr students have re»
turned to the campus for‘the 1325
commencement ceremonies. Events
have followed one another in rapid
succession, beginning with the dance
Friday evening, and continuing with
the senior class play, "Arms and the
Man" the following night, and with the
baccalaureate sermon, special vesper
service and musical presentation on
Sunday. Toda is set aside for the
alumni and various class reunions
have been planned to supplement the
alumni picnic. Following the Com—
mencement address tomorrow a com-
mcncement luncheon will he held in
the quadrangle dining hall.

Topping all other activities in im-
portance and interest' will be the coin—
mencement address delivered by Dr,
Samuel Strauss, of New York City,
at the Congregational church, Tuesday
morning. Dr. Strauss is unquestion—
ably one of the leading authorities on
social and literary questions in Amer-
ica today, Before going east to be-
come editor of the New York Globe he
was connected with the Des Moines
Register and is, therefore, conversant
with the viewpoint and problems of
the middle west. He severed his as-
sociation with The Globe to accept a
position on the editorial staff of the
\‘ew York Times, froiii which he re-
tired some years ago to organize The
Villager, a weekly literary publication
in which he discusses current problems
and which has attracted a wide circle
of discriminating readers throughout
the country. Grinncll College ha-
stowed the degree of Doctor 01 Laws
upon Mr. Strauss in 1915.

Tomorrow morning at 9:30 o'clock
the academic procession of trustees,
guests, facility, and seniors with Dean
Nollcn as marshal and Dr. Marcus E.
Jones of the class of 1375 as honorary ‘
marshal, will leave the chapel for the
church where the graduating exercises
will begin at 10:00 o‘clock. Following
the address by Samuel Strauss the
candidates for degrees will he presents
cd by Dean Nollen and the degrees
will be conferred by President Main,

The class to receive degrees is the
largest in the history of the School and
is the largest liberal arts class ever
graduated west of the Ohio. In addi»
[ion to being the largest in Gl‘innell
history, the 1325 seniors have been
prominent in the contributions to Grin»
neli. It includes several students
who have Won Scholarships to Various
universities for graduate Work, headed
by Neil Crane, the 1925 Rhodes Scholar
from Iowa. Most outstanding of its
Contributions to Grinnell, perhaps, is
the Maltese Cross Loan Fund, to
which the lnelnbElS of the Class con—
tributed $10,900 to add to st sum of
$10,000, given by D. W'. Norris of Mzr~
shalltown, '36.

Tomorrow afternoon at 4:0010’clock.
President and Mrs Main will be at
home to all Visitors and friends and
at night the commencement exercises
will be brought to a close by the men's
glee club with its evening concert on
Blair Steps.
