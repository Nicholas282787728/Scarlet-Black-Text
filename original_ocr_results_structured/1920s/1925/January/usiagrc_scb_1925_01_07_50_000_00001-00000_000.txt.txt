The Pioneer eager-s tackle the fast
Kansas quintet, Missouri Valley challlr
pions for the past three years, in tlic
'flrst conference game of the season
for both teams, tomorrow.

Under Coach Black, the crinnell
suuad has been undergoing hear-y
workouts ever sillce the football se.-
son closed. and are now in as good
condition as can be expected for the
start of a season. The preseason
game against Wisconsin, two weeks
ago, showed that the tearu needed a
lot ol work, and heavy practices have
been the daily schedule all during the
holidays.

The Jayhawkers, although they have
lost several valuable men from last
year's team again have a strong uutlrt
this season, and will be dangerous
contenders for the conference chain.

yards team of former Missouri Valley
slars in a preseason game recently,
Kansas showed that they will have to
be counted among the strong pennant
contenders. '

.Pioneers are to win.

The dope on paper seems to be all
in favor of the southern team, but the
Pioneers are as yet an unknown quanv
tity, and the Wisconsin game is hard-
ly a fair estimate of the real strength
of Coach Black’s proteges. The dea
tense of the tea inappears better than
in former years, and on occasions the
Pioneers have shown real offensive
power, although the lack or forward
material has been a serious handicap
in that branch of the game. Too, the
team is not yet used to working to.

the early season games, and a lot de-

Should the Pioneers get off to a good
start, they will have a better chance
of heating the much touted Kansas
team than they have had in years.

Probable Lineup

it is very probable that the same
team that started the Wisconsin game
will also start the .layhawker battle.
Moran is almost certain to hold dorvn
one forward berth, with either Doffing
or Chase us his running mate. Buge
will likely he at center with Captain
Galvin at one guard, and either winter
or Wing at the other. Hays is our
other sophomore who is making a
good showing at either guul'd or for»

In order to encourage this adjust
