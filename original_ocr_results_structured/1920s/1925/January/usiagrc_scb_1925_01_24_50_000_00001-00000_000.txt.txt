“I have come to l'ellol’t progress,"
said Miss Sarah Wamhaugh, noted
authority on international relations.
speaking in Herrick chapel last night,
on the subject, “The League of Nations
at Work.”

A delightful and pleasing personal—
ity. coupled with a thorough know-
ledge of her subject. Enabled Miss
Wflmbilrigli to present a graphic pic-
ture of the progress the League is
actually milking toward World peace.
"Progress." was undoubtedly the key-
note word Df ller lecture, and the feel»

listeners. was one of decided optimism.

,"The great nDWel's of the world.

plaining the Folly of the League onrthe
armament problem.

Miss Wainbangh told how the draft
treaty for disarinent that the Lemme
drew up. was killed by Ramsey Mc-
Donald. who because of certain plain»
as. had to offer something else The
League hreathicssly awaited his new
proposal and rec vcd what the) had
hoped for. an offer of universal com-
pulsory arbitration. Arbitration with-
out sanctions would not be acceptable

a significant step forward that the

center at Ames tonight, when Gl'lmlell
plays the Cyclones there. The Drake-
Gl'innell game featured last week be.
cause of the keen rivalry between the
schools, and the game tonight will be
eagerly watched for the same reason.

Dope gives Grinnell a slight edge on
nines because of the fact that the
Pioneers nosed out Missouri by 25 to
23 count while Ames lost to the Tigers
28 to 15. However, Ames reversed hcr
form and threw a scare into the strong
Oklahoma team by holding them to a
27—24 score. This latter dope seems
no indicate that the Farmers are
stronger than they have generally been
accredited, and that the game should
:be very evenly played.

flu Captain Ruff, forward. and Jacob-
son, center, Amos has two dangerous
scorers, and any team which scores
24 points against Oklahoma, which held
Nebraska, the Valley leaders, to 23
points, must be seriously reckoned
wlth.

Coach Black is working his team
'hard to drill an adequate offensive
system into them, which was
sorely lacking in the Drake-
Grinnoll tilt. The men have been

Treasurer Phelps I sues Smtelnent—
Cd'tizoiis National Bank in Good
Condition.

The closing of the Gl'inllell savings
Bank last Tuesday moi-mug did not
seriously endanger Grinnell College
funds. Louis V. 'Pbelps, the college
treasurer, has issued the followung
statement. “It is definitely known that
the working funds of the college were
not materially affected by the closing
of the Savings Bank. However, the
Grinnell Foundation bad a small bu!»
once in two different accounts."

Mr. Phelps has a great deal of con:
fidence in the Citizen's National Bauk,|
which, since the closing of both the
Merchant's National and the Grinnell
Savings, is now the only active bank
in the city. With deposits of nearly
a. million dollars and a great portion
of its funds 0 placed that it may be
readily liqui ed the Citizen's National
is well prepared to handle the pres—
ent situation In spite. of the large

[run on the bank soon after the e

sodc of last Tuesday, the regular der
posits were being continually made so
that the officials of the bank did ncfi
need to accept tnc aid which was im—i
mcdiately offcrcd by Dos bloiucsi
banks which realized the souufl coin
union of the institution.

Thcre seems to be little doubt but
that at least two banks can be sup
ported in Grillueli. Yet for the pres-
ellt, the Cltlzen's National must try
to handle all the financial needs of
the community, Carl E. Child, the
Cashier of this bank, has asked for the
cooneratioh of the public during the
period of stress. He says, "There
were formerly tln-ee banks to handlc
the same business that one must take
cam of now. We ask the public
please to be patient, and with our
cramped facilities we will try to do
our best to give service. While We
are doing the additional work of two
commodlous banks it may seem from
the number of people about that
we are having a run. As amattcr of
fact, our deposits are steadily mount-
ing," ‘ ,

Although nothing definite has been
announced hy the committee which is
working towards a reorganization of
the Merchant's National, it ls under-
stood that men from out of town were
here early this week looking ovr the
situation. This visit followed the au-
nouncement that stock in the proposed
bank would be offered to people out—
side Grinnell.

EXPERIENCES IN NTERNATIONAL

ARAH WAMBAUGH

 

Miss Sardh Wilmhaugh, who spoke
at Herrick chapel Friday night on. the
League oi Nations, is as charming and
gracious in private conversation its
she is on the lecture platform. She
gave at delightful interview tu an s.
and B. reporter this morning at the
Hotel Monroe Where she stayed While
in Grinnell.

In reply to the Interviewers ques-
tlou as to when she first became in-
terested in international law and the
league, she replied,

“Oh, my father cftme from Ohio. MY
theory is that it is in Ohio tllztt pol—
itics are born, Then my father was
fl lawyer. “’e used to discuss to-
gether questions of politics all] law.
I majored at Rdtcliffe college ill the
department of gul'erllmellt, which cor-
responds to your department of poly
ilicftl science. Following my grallur
fttioll I was assistant to the professor
0| govolnllleui at Radcliffe for four
.Veflrs.

"I belonged In those (lflys in that
grain) of young people who believed
that war was a thing of the past and
that with our high degree of civiliza-
tion \V'le‘ was impossible. I assure
you, it was a shock, a horli‘ule
shncll, when the war broke out in
1914, such it thing was beyond the
bounds of my imagination."

At the outbreak of the Great War,
Miss W'dmbaugh associated herself
with an organization which advocated
some sort of a league of nations. She
served by a year and a half as secre-
tary of this organization, resigning to
return to Radcliffe for her master‘s
degree in political science and inter
nfttinnal law.

“I became thoroughly convinced as a
result of my studies," she declared,
"that the world needed a league of im—
tions. So I wrntc my thesis on the
philosophy of the state and the need
for it league of nations.

"It was the war that first aroused

and I continued my interest while the
peace conditions Were under discus-
slon.

“While I was summary of the organ-
ization for the advancement of the
league of nations idea, i received

that there were in the Harvard Univer-
sity library two or three very short
articles in French. I suggested to
the Carnegie Endowment that they al-
low we to translate and publish the
articles, They said no. If I was
going to go into the matter at all, they
wanted something more complete—a
monograph on plebiscitcs for the state
department, Now a monograph nced
not be long, but mine was for I found
a wealth of material on the subject af-
ter investlgatlug a while,

“After I finished my monograph, but
while it was still unpublished, I went
to England in 1919 to do graduate
work at the Univers-ty of London and
at Oxford. In London, a friend of
mine, who knew that I was interested
in the League and in international af-
fairs, asked me to take his place on
the secretariat, The secretariat was
located at London then, but was re
moved soon to Geneva whore accumu-
datious were found for it,

“I knew when I accepted the posi~
tion that it would only be temporary.
There were five Americans on the
secretariat then, appointed at the time
when it was taken for granted that
America would join the League."

When asked how the officials of the
league look upon the appearance of
women in their midst, Miss Wambaugh
said.

”Well. you know the covenant of
the league says that women shall have
m the
business of the organization. But I
believe that that time has not yet
come. For one thing, there are few
women trained for league positions.
The head of the League library is an
American woman and the head of the
social department is an Engllsb we-
luau.

These two women and myself are
the only women who have the position
of experts. There are a few women
secretaries, however. I have never
found any personal dlscriminatlon

No formal st‘rif‘s er toasts \ rP. ar-

impromptu talks were given by- var-

Tious alumni and members of the team.

The kcynotc of the evening was the
comeback Grinnell mode in athletics
last fall. C, L, I-lulsizer of Des Moln-
es spoke first. and after paying a tri-
hute i0 Coach Hyland, mentioned the
vztlue in after life or being able to take
orders, an invaluable lesson learned
on the football field.

Clyde McFarland of Montezuma, a
member of the athletic advisory com»
mittee, pointed out‘ how the good
sportsmanship of the Pioneers my
ways won the crowd. and how the
at both Cedar Ram . and 0m-
aba were hcilind Gl'lllllcll throughout
the two different games.

George Clements oi Ccdnl' thpllls
spoke on the trad oils Gl'lllllell prized,
and said “tradition and sentiment

“The broke the Allies i v last fall.

I: H, Shalllfling praised the spirit

snort talks praising Grinneii and es-

Meredith Sweet, '26, of Minneapolis.
Minn, was elected Captain of the 1925
football squad at the football banquet
held Thursday night.

Although the new Pioneer leader
now lives in Minneapolis, he gained
his football experience at Mitchell is.
D.) high school where he played half-
back for three years. and was captain
and on Alpstate halfback his senlor
year. In his last year of high school
football, he was coached by Don Par-
ker, '21, a former Pioneer star ham '
back who interested Sweet in Grinnell.

His first year here, Sweet was the,
sensation of the freshman squad bs-
cause of his consistent ability to run
through the varsity for long gains in
scrimmage. He was elected captain
of the preps that year, and. stepped
right into a varsity position the next
fall.

In his first year of Missouri valley
football, he was used at fullback, so
he could circle either end from the
box formation. He was the best ground
gainer Grinnell had that year, and be-
sldes starring in running the ends, he
hit the line and did most of the pass-
ing.

Last fall, under a new coach, he was
shifted back to halfback, where he
starred so consistently that he mads
the unusual record of not missing a
minute of playing time in the entire
schedule. '

Sweet has made a reputation for
himself which ls well known in Valley
circles. His short jabs into the line,
his off-tackle plunges, and his wide
cud runs have been lustrumemal in
winning many games, McBride, sport-
ing editor of the Kansas City Star,
placed him on his second/All-Vallcy
