the result that the list of the year's
happenings and accomplishments is

Taylor World’s Greatest.

Running his last races for Grinnell
this spring, Morgan Taylor convinced
everyone that he is one of the greatest
track athletes of all time. In the
home meet he gave proof of this by
winning both hurdles, the high jump
and broad jump and the 220 yard dash
all in record time. his 220 time even
hesting that made by the laments
"Chuck" Hoyt. In the state meet he
captured both hurdles and the broad
jump, and then to cap the climax
turned in a performance at the Mis-
souri valley meet that has never been
equalled. He ran the high hurdles
in :14.7, the lows in :23.3 and then
broad jumped 25 feet 2 inches, to enter
the slim ranks ot those who have
jumped 25 feet, only three other men
in the United States having done it,
Hubbard of Michigan, I.eGendr-e of
Princeton and Goiirdin of Harvard,
Taylor also ran on the lialfdulle and
mile 'relay teams and in the mile relay
has been clocked in the quarter at :43.

Mei-t Oyt‘m‘il nil Plaffurin.

In debating and dramaties the year
was quite uniisiral in that never before
have Grinnell debuturs faced a team
from Oytcrd University, England, and
never before has a Grinnell dramatic
club had the courage to give a Slrakese
pearean nlay. Under the direction or
Mrs. Hallie Flanagan the work in the
dramatic department has been unllsllr
ally ﬁne and from the work of the
Experimental Theatre ‘to the All-
college revue quite praiseivorthy from
the standpoint of the large audiences
who attended.

The School of Music numbered
among its recital numbers Rene
Cheme, Anna Case and the Barrere Lite
tie Symphony and to those were added
the line work of both glee clubs. The

men's glee club as usual proved its'

motto of “Best in the West' by plac-
ing third in the intercollegiate contest
at Chicago. ' "

In scholarship the greatest honor
was received by Neil Crone, '25. who
was granted the Rhodes scholarship
from Iowa. thus entitling him to ‘four
years at Oxford. Crone was also one
or the eighteen honored with Phi Beta
Kappa ke

year was the series of lectures by D .
