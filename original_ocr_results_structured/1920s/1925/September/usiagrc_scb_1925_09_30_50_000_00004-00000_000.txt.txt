 

At Chapel
This Week i

Mdlltlily.

Professor eccil r. Lavell's chapel
tallt, Monday morning, continued the
thought which had been expressed by
President luaiu and Dean Nollcn in
the pro ding week Just as the r st
pl'erl‘equi te or bring is life itself,
and just as life must be co-ordinateu
by rhythm, so lilto isc is truth 11cc-
cssnry for life,

Professor Lal‘ell stated that we
cannot begin too soon “to walrt the
truth." however difficult it may be to
give up preconeeued prejudices and
ideals. "Most peoplo do not want the
truth. Every (lat reputedly
honest mau tolls dozens-or [n.lschoods
which fall within the category of so-
cial lies. just because it is necessa ,
to protect ourselves by tacit agree-
ment against the conflict which abs
solute candor would prodllce,‘

We have idea s above the
which destroys them, because "they
are part 01' my world and i hate to
see them shaken." Yet this subor-
dination of truth to mental comfort
brings us to a strange end. There is
no worse standard of social value
than peace. “Pain is unconnortnble
but is at least a sign we are not
dead yet."

In conclusion, Professor Lavellssid
that truth is more a matter of the
indispensihle form or living than the
opposite or a lie. Truth is not mere
accuracy but that which keeps us
alive. “Absolute loyalty to the truth
is one of the few fundamentals of
life."

Tuesday.

Although the pajama parade may
not he scientific proof or the hypoth-
esis conceived about '20ilo B. C. by a
Babylonian that man is derived from
a branch of the sheep family. it is ac—
cording to Professor 0. N. Smiley,
positive proof that man in a crowd
does not use his head but blindly fol-
lows a leader. Because an ripper
classman once suggested to a fresh»
men that it would be fun to parade in
night gowns. succeeding generations
of Gl'inncll freshmen liar-e followed
blindly in his foot steps, even to the
extent of paying a two dollar and
fifty cent damage charge as necessary
for the fun.

Mobs do not thinlt, usually neither
do nroh leaders. "Gr-cgariousness is
not association." Bacon says that
conference mah s a ready man and
“college men." said Professor Smiley
in closing, “do not meet often enough
in conference." Simple gregariousness
does not take the place of conference
for the free exchange of thought that
helps to make the ready man.

book editor, expanding the reriew
section into a more comprehensive
department. More hooks will be re-
\‘ieu ed than in the past and a ”best
readers or the month" column will be
run. The art department, under
ranlinc Croolr, is developing into a
more important unit than ever. Sev»
eral professional cartooni. s have
been secured as contributors and the
local artists are more numerous and
or better calibre than ever before.

Although the ranks of the Teasers
was greatly depleted by graduation
last spring, the present oncoming
contributors promise a good quality
of work. Short stories will he run in
this year's issue for the first time and
the poetry and verse section will be
greatly enlarged.

Harry Lainbly says, ”I wish the
student body would feel more than
ever that the Malteaser is their roas-
azlne, I want them to submit copy at
all times. It is impossible for me to
get in personal contact with everyone
in school who writes. I wish those of
the incoming freshman class who
have journalistic tendencies or be-
have they have, would look me up.
I would like to talk things over with
them. 1 would like the iialteaser to
become the campus publication whore
all literary creations would lind a
place of expression whether humor-
ous. poetical, or novel in nature.
