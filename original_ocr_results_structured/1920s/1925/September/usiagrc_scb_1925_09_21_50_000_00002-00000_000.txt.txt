The Scarlet and Bloch tor us own,
salso and on behall- oi the studentl
irody, wishes to uelcorne the class or
15129 to Gl'lnnell College.

We hope that you will like Grill-
nell and that college llie here Will he
all and more than you expected it to
be. We are inclined to feel that'
there is no hetter liheral arts school
than Grinnell and that we are all lor—
tunate in setting to come here. We
‘tl‘eely admit that the Spirit oi 01d,
Grinnell has captivated us and wcl
hope that you are even more suscep—
tible to its charms.

Student government regulates the
life on this campus and now that you
are Grinnellions we hope that you
will immediately reel yourselves cit»
izens ot a, campus community. 'Xou
have both rights and ohlisrations and
the sooner you learn rrrhat they me
and how best to exercise them, the'
more enjoyable and proﬁtable your‘
time at Grinnell will be.

Best wishes tor a good year.

“TLL IT BE YOUl
,At‘ter nine months oi school have
passed the ireshrncn class will not
he as large as it is at present, There
will he several who will leave and the
causes ior- departure will probably he
many. Some will he chance or ace
cidental reasons, others purely Schol-
astic, ior averages tell us that there
.u-ill he a few who will tail in their‘
studies Will it he you?
There are hundreds of people"
through out the country who do not‘
have the brains to'pass a collegeE
course, hot it is doubtlul if any oi,
them ev'el :zet heyond the high school‘
harrier. It is almost sale to sav‘
that every person in the class oi 19291
is capable of carrying the work as—
signed. Some. will do it more easill'l
than \othel's, but all have the mental
faculties it' they care to apply them—
selves strictly to the job of passing
the required course
Most of the students who fail‘
should give as an excuse not lack or
brains, although that may have its at»
feet, but failure to use what they
have. Outside iorces may occasional-
ly exercise a power and than shift the
blame off the failing strident, hut as
a rule it is his own fault and it ought
to he a. good to him to know that he
is doing poorly because he is not try-
ing as hard as he could
A golier who was not playrng much
gait hut could not quit, was heard to
remark that he was not discouraged
~hut terribly unhappy. That will he
