Staging Drive to Keep Sum-

Grinneil people will soon be called
upon to decide deﬁnitely whether Arc
bor Luke is to \relnain a community
playground, or revert to its old slate
at disuse and public neglect, so far
asjts possibilities as a pleasure re—
sort are concerned.

Much yet remains to be done. The
Commercial Club, working in thedn~
terests of Grinnell people, has made
arrangcments to renew the lease but
the lease cannot be signed until there
is deﬁnite assurance on the part of
Criimell people that the funds will
be available.

The committee has worked out a
careful and conservative budget.
which totals $1500, This amount in—
cludes the yearly rental, salary to
caretaker and maintenance and im-
provements necessary to insure pub—
lic saletv and satisfaction.

So far, the response has been gen-
erous tl-om those solicited and the en-
thusiasm in all parts of the city is
gratifying and encouraging.

Not dismayed by the iollying ot
