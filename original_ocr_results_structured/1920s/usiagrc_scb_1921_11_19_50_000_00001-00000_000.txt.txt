“Duck Drake” Slogan of
Campus—Team Ready _
for Big Clash. '

"Duck Drake" is the slogan of the
Pioneer followers while the team has
been going through daily scrimmages
during the past week. Every night
for me last four nights Coach Stumr
ders has given the varsity a hard work
out against the ireshman squad. The
freshmen, using Drake tor-motions
and plays, have proved themselves
capable of iuruishing some real oppo-
sitiou and, although using plays i
which were new to them, they have
given the varsity plenty to worry
about. Today's scrimmage may be the
last before the big game. At lesat it will
be the last intensive one. because as
the day of the big battle with the
Bulldogs approaches, it becomes more
and more necessary to guard against
possible injuries to valuable men.

Practice Passes

Special attention has been given to
developing a defense against the style
of aerial attack which Drake has used
this season. The yearling squad has
been imitating Drake passes and the
varsity have been breaking up the
attempts in a very consistent manner.l

Taken as a whole, the squad has-
come through the season with few as .,
ions injuries and they will he prepared
to go against" their old rivals with ev-
ery man on the squad ready to do his,
share or the Work. The team has been,
showing considerable improvement in;
its last two games, and...., with the in:

Drake strong

Drake has a strong team this year-,i
one of the best in her history. Comr‘
paratrve scores are all in their favo .‘
Nevertheless, the team which Grin.
hell is sending to Des Moines pert
Thursday is going with both a detel~-‘
mination to win and a conviction that
they will win. This game. besides hc-‘
ing the classic of the GriDDell season,‘
is the last chance the Pioneers will
have this season to vindicate their
record.

Dope has always proven more or
less unreliable in regard to the Drake
Grimlell game, because a Grinuell
team is never the same when it is
playing Drake as it is in my other
game. Last year's game was a proof
of the ﬁght a Scarlet and Black team
can put up against Drake after a
poor season. By a wonderful evbi
tlon of football strategy and sheer
pluck the Pioneers tied their much
vaunted rivals in the last quarterl
and thus gained what was conceded,
even by Drake followers, to be a "molu
a1 victory" even though the actual
score indicated a tie.

Big Game for Alumni

or added importance this year is
the fact that the game will be play-
ed on Thanksgiving day, and will be
the real homecoming game tor the
alumni especially those in Des Moinm
and vicinity. A special train will
carry the students of Grinnell to Des
Moines tor the game, and a special
section has been reserved, the seats
for which may be obtained at the
men’s gymnasium.

Missouri Valley Teams to

Local Floor. ‘

i

H. l. ”Doc” Huff returned last week
from Kansas Ctiy where he attended
a meeting or the Missouri officials who
met to formulate rules and organize a
schehdule for Missouri Valley teams
during the coming season. A new
system has been originated this year
under which every Missouri valley
team will meet every other team once,
on its home [lour and once on its op—‘
pouent’s tloor. This will mve local
football enthusiasts a chance to see
Grinuell in action against every other
team in the conference. Such a plan
will undoubtedly serve to greatly
heighten interest in basketball this
year as it will give local fans a chance'
to term their opinions as to the rela—
tive strength of all the Valley teams.
The schedule is as iollowe:

Jan. 5—K. s A. C. at Manhattan.

Jan. c—Itansas at Law once.

Jan. T—Dklzlllomh at Norman.
