The Pioneer net team for the year
will be chosen by air elimination sys-
tem which i dificrent troin any plan
ever used here.

The men ti-_ rig out have drawn an
initial ranking by lot and hour this
aborc rating to challenge area
above thein until the best four have
demonstrated their abil ' to hold
down the lit t loiir positions. The plan
is fairly spee _ and it is thought that
three or tour matches ior each player
will be sufficient to pick the team.

Alihollgh the plan is new at Grille
nell it is the one iii common proctrcci
in other Missouri valley schools as
well as in the Big Ten universities. it
has been iouud to be the fairest and
quickest way of choosing the best and
most consistent perlormei-s with the
racquet.

The rules of the system are as iol-
low ~

1. Each man may challenge any one
ot the iirst three men above him on
the list. in case he loses the match
all ratings remain unchanged, ii the
challen‘ger wins he presumes the los-
er's previous position, Tire loser, and
all names between the position of the
challenged and the challenger, drop
down one space, thiis keeping all
places in the list filled.

2. it the challenger is defeated, he
cannot again challenge the victorious

‘ opponent until a period 0! three days
has elapsed.

The initiali rating, as determined by
lots drawn vesterday, are: (1) Moore,
(2) Halse (a) Nicolet, (4) Berry,
is) Dewey, to) Brody, (71 Pink, (a)
hurt, to) w. Stotts. (10) F. Jones,

Bﬂllll BUSINESS AS All
SSSUPMISN Fllll MEN

E. E. Quantreu Encourages Men to
"like lip bond business as
Lire irorh.

Among' the many lines or commer-
cial endeavor in which a large num-
ber oi the 1925 graduates of colleges
will engage, there is one iieid that to-
day is attracting an increasingly larg-
er number of men who possess certain
qllaliﬁcatlonsinnmely, the iieid of
investment banking, more commonly
reterred to as "the bond business."

The bond business appeals particur
larly to college men; in fact, a large
percentage oi the men now in the buss
iness are college men, It is also our
observation that if‘they once start in
the business most college men stay in
it all their lives, provided they have a
moderate degree oi success the first
year or two. This is important when
you consider the various occupations
in which the average graduate engages
the iirst Io years he is out or school
heiore finding the work he likes and
for which he is fitted. It is a young
man's business, requiring brains, chars i
octer and tireless energy. Like a pro-
tession, the worh requires a liberal
education, To the man who is a good I
student, a hustler and a good mixer
it otfei-s unlimited opportunities.

No business has broader interesto‘
than the bond business, Tn illustrate,
