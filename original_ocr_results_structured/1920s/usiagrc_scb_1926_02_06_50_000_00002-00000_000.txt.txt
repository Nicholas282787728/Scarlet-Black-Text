“Another 01 the greatest GVllS or

the fraternity System. It has created

campuses that would Shame the court

by these self-alleged aristocratic or—

And then as a remedy Drake is sug-

In a large majority of colleges this

The above is an inmi-esting opinion
to say the least but the writer took
himself too seriously. College Stilr

Drake student who says so can expect
to be the object of much laughter.

The fraternity question does not
bother Grinnell but in the main it is
probable that the same general social
problems exist here as elsewhere. So
tar as Grinncll is concerned. the only
dinerence between the student who

Bigger Generators—
Cheaper Electricity

A 70,000 horsepower llydro»clectric unit recently installed at:
Niagara Falls utilizes the same amount of water as seven
former 5,000-horsepower units, yet: does the work of fourteen
such units. And it saves 700,000 tons of coal yearly for the

nation.

As more and still more uses are found for electricity, larger
and more economical generators are installed. At the power
plant, as well as at the consume s end. important changes and
startling developments have steadily reduced the cost of

electricity for light, power, and heat.
