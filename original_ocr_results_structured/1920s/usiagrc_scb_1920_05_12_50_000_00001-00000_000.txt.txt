MEET_S_ATUHIIAY

Scholtz Doped to Count
Heavily for Mis-
sourians.

For the ﬁrst time since 1905 the
Pioneer track squad takes on a Uni-
versity of Missouri team. in a dual
track and ﬁeld meet on Ward ﬁeld
next Saturday afternoon. The only
other such meet ever held with the
Southerners was annexed by the Scar-
let and Black by the narrow margin
of two points.

In Scholz the Tigers have a danger-
ous dash man. behaving Won the cen-
lllry at the Drake relays this spring
at the low mark of :09-4. He must
also be ﬁgured on heavily in the 220-
yard clash and the short relay. Strong
competition will be furnished the Pic-
neers in the quarter-mile and the llur~
dles, but little information is to be had
on the smltherners' strength in the

pal’tment they are good this year.

Hus: To Run.

The meet promises to be close due to‘

the fact that the Maltese Cross is also
strung ln practically the same events
as are the Missourians. The Pioneers
should point heavily in the jumps. pole

vault and long runs, with a possible;

few counters in the weights. This is
borne out by the fact that the Cyclones
were forced to the limit in most of the
events in the dual bere last Saturday.

Karl Hass, although forced out of
the lOiLyard dash last week because
of e strained tendon. has been work-
ing hard to overcome this difficulty.
so that by next Saturday he should

again be able to run in his old-timeI

form.

lighted with her playing.

tone. splendid technique and intona<
tion. She played with an ease lbat
showed her mastery of her instrument
and she entered into tbe spirit of the
Compositions wbicb she was interpret—
lug.

Tbe Grieg sonata. for violin and
piano afforded opportunity for variety
of expression and style. The “Con-
certo in D minor" snowed Miss Seary's
ability in technique. the difficult pas-
sages. being executed witb clearness
and ﬁnish. while ber concluding group
of pieces. especially the string “Polo-
liaise Brillante” was greatly appreci-
ated by the audience.

fairly strong Wind, the time for all
events was extra good.

stouc and Sechrist bolb broke the
state record of 4.304 in‘ the mile when
the Ames runner barely nosed out Se-
cbrlst for ﬁrst place. in 4:28—1. The
'lnal‘k will not stand as a new record,
as new state marks must be made at
lthe state meet. Lodwick's time of
1—3 for the 220 was made with a.
1 strong wind at his back. ‘

Ames got away to a good start by
taking ﬁrst and second in the high
hurdles, and ﬁrst and third in the mile
and the cculury (lash. The Cyclones
‘contiriued to roll up points in every
event. LodWick annexed the 100 afe

because of a tendon wbicb suddenly
ligbtcned in his leg. Paulu was a. close
second, the time being ten flat.

Frevert work for second place. Paulu
led Lodwl‘ck in the 220 for most of tile
distance, but was nosed out in the last
ten yards. Bccbmlcr forced Tracy to
clear eleven feet in the vault for a
tie for ﬁrst place, and Vinsel made
Paige leap 22 feet 4 inches to annex
the broad jump. The Cyclones got
drsts in botb the wcigbt events. Her-
.rlott wds second in the discus and
iHicks got third in the shot.
