RENT PROFITEER

Effective Plan Used at University
of Illinois.

l

Various methods have been used to
combat high rents during the last two
months, but none more ctfective than
the plan resorted to by more than 111-11
thousand students at 1he U111vers1ty of
Illinois.

Landlords 111 Iii-hana this year coin-
bincd to raise the weekly rent, and
succeeded in boosting the prices to
such a Iigtu-e that many students
were unable to meet the demon
Accordingly, a campaign was waged
in the student publications against
the protuccring, 111d the names of a
long list at landlords, together with‘
the prices they were chargmg, was
printed 111 the publications.

The result was a general lowering
of rent within two hours after the 111.1
per came out.
