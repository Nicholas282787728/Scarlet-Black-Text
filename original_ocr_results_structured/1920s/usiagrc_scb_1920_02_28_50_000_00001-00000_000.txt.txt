JUNIORS STAOE
MYSTIO PAN- PAN

FOR ALL TONIGHT

Panic and Pandemon- '

ium Reign at All-C01-
lege Show.

The mystic Word “PAN" is the keys
note of the Junior all-college Show to
be held tonight in the Alumni Hall
Auditorium, with everything on the

program from PAeremonium to PANicI

The most\rema1'kable thing about

the performance, aside from the fact.

that it is absolutely. free to all who
wish to come, is the dark secrecy
with which it is covered. The seventh
number on the program is entitled
"Mrs. Rameses ll, tuce Miss Annis
Thetic).” it was passed upon by the
faculty committee on Aesthetic Art,
according to a statement on the pro.
gram.

The committee was very careful
about giving anything out for publi.
cation. when asked about number
eight on the program, called ,"Hel'e’s
'the Pail, Who's got the Dime?" they
would not say whether the pail was
to contain real “suds" or something
else.

Vamp to be Tllcrcl

Number four is called "The vamp."
It is rumored that the original baby
doll will be displayed at this time.

The hardest thing to fathonr on the

program is the second number called,

“PANcgyrics.” This might mean any

thing from some fancy tumbling Stunt

by the gym athletes, to a speech.
Another number is entitled ”Meow."

Whether this is the intermission or ai

mis print could not be determined.

"The Ruthl'ule duo” probably leaves
the most room for imagination.
is ccrtain that one of the eharaoteI s
must be a girl. but the other one i.
unannounced. There s room for much
ingenuity- and initiative here "PAN

This might be a number by some one
who failed to make the glec clubs
