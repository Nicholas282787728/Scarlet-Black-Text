characteristics of this age a most interesting hold for
discussion and contemplation. Gl'innell can probably
consider her highli- organized Social system as it affords
opportunities for, or seriously prevents the development
at individual qualities.

The speaker in chapel made it clear that as society
at large becomes more of an organism, and less a col-
lectiou of detached personalities, it tends to tlwarf and
minimize the individual until he feels definite restric-
tions upon self-expression. In other words, society tends
to become standardized, to produce a certain "[3119" or
conformists. To act with the group becomes the only
comfortable thing to do, when it is realized that to do
otherwise brands one as “queer," or “undesirable."
one does not consciously choose to become classiﬁed
thus, he sacriﬁces his wishes to those of the group, and
“play the game.” Further, this is made the more pleas-
ant thing to do, so the whole process becomes clcrerlr

man is c pcctcd to participate in building athletics, in
order that the intra mural standing of the hall may be
strengthened, he must date. in order that tlic hall may
“rat socially on the campus; lie iriust spend the usual
amount of time in session, “bull" or other kind, in order
that he may be a good fellow among the others, In short.
lic is expected Lo subject his own feelings and interests
to Guest: of the building. Perhaps in many instances the
two are allied, but in many other cases the wishes of
the individual lire cast aside.

Tile question is, whether this is a desirable situa—
tion. But, whether desirable or not, it is inevitable prob»
only as long as we maintain the theory here that serv—
ice to society is the first law of modern lite, and that
Griimell is a laboratory in the type of citizenship that
society requires It is to be observed that the farther
east one goes, the less stress is laitl upon group lite
and coniormity in colleges At Harvard the student he—
comes so individualistic that he even remains a stranger
to the man living next to him in the dormitory. Hence,
it schools such as Harvard believe with Gl'innell that the
student must be educated and equipped to render a
service to society, they must also believe-that college
preparation tor sucli service should consist of a differ
cat and more individualistic training. Perhaps it would
be fair to say that they believe that college should he a
study oi life through the curriculum rather than a train»
log in life through organizations.

it is for us to adhere to the one theory of the other,
We are convinced that the Grioncll plan, which drau-
the student almost involuntarily into a veritable vorte
oi activities suppre es intliiuhial development to a cor
lain extent insofar as that development might color the
group stream. As previous v stated, however, such a
condition may he inevitable; it may be simply an attribute

less, (lull suggest it as a gootl problem or practical sh,»

growth of junior colleges throughout this ctioli or the
country, which cqic ioi tlic -tuilouts only one oi two

prospective Gi melllfills to remain at liolnc iii college
for a time, w iuus problems are tirisinght Gviunell, anti
at all other colleges which face the Smile situation. It
is one of assimilation,

u l

Grinnell expects that students who entered as fresh-
ment shall be fully qualified “cit mm or Grinnell," and
adapted to their environments by the end of their iirst
year here. In general this expectation is realized, To
reach this status.the freshman must quickly abandon old
forms and old customs. as they relate to his school life
and general conduct, and take on the new modes of liv-
ing which makes Grinnell essential. It is this process of
adoption which is the cause of so much freshman dii»
ficélty, but it is the first important step in his education.

Likewise, upper class transfers must forget the old.
take on the new, and become in all ways Grinnellinns.
This is doubtless the wish of every transfer student,
otheiwise, he would not have come here. He must feel,
certainly, that Grihhell's methods and purposes are do:
sirable in his litc.
his few years at Grihnell count. He will aid mateiially
in this if he will cooperate to the fullest extent with the
college and other students in harmonizing himself rape
idly with his environment.
