The ultimate purpose of taking a foreign language in
college is to gain a reading knowledge of that language.
With this in mind, we believe the foreign language r .
otiii-enieiit at Grliinell sltould he changed to a "reading
knowledge” rather than a specific number of credit ldoul'<
ot a particular type. ,

One reason for this fact is that at the present time
there is an outstanding ahsui-di ~ in the [0] . ge
requirements. Tire college takes no cognizance of high
school wo in those subjects as tar as filling roouire-
ments are concerned, but it does recognize high school
credit as a prerequis' e to advanced language courses.

‘ To be moi-e specific, Grlnnell requires that a student
. have twelve hours of foreign language credit, six of
which must be advanced. in order to be gra uated. That
in itself is not objectionable~aside from the liiteiital train-
ing, a cultured person should have a reading knowledge
or some other language than his own. Since the begin—
ning language course is merely the euuivalcnt or a tw -
year high scltool course, a student entering collcge uitb
two years of French, for example, to his credit, is placed
in an advanced course here. He is in the same cla
w h sophomore students and docs the same work all year.
limvever, at the end of two semesters the sophomores iii
t e class have fulfilled their language requirement. while
the other student still has to obtain s. more hours of
that language credit. For ‘plll'poSeS of illustration, both

students hare an equal acquaintance with thc language,
both have what is termed a "reading knowledge" or

French; yet the student \t ho lias‘spciit two pciicctly good ,

ycais in high school attempting to clear may some at
his college rcquireiitcuts s l‘m-ccd, in most cases against
his will, to continue the stud)- of the language.

it i in the sense explained that we believe the for-
cign language rcquiremciit should be changed to a ”1041th
mg hiiowledg rathcr than a set and rigid rule of 1
specific number of credit hours.

indicate that.

The final game of the women's iiie
terclass basketball tournament will'
be played Monday afternoon at Rand
gymnasium when the freshmen will
battle the senior sextet for the cham-
pionship. Both leftms have gone
through the season undefeated and
will put tip a real light for the title.

The seniors, winner of the cup and
champions for three successive yea; ,
are not disposed to allow the preps to
walk off with their last game, and the
am spect of a record of four yea
withotit a defeat will doubtless lead
them to make the fight of their ca-
reers in the game Monday. The play
