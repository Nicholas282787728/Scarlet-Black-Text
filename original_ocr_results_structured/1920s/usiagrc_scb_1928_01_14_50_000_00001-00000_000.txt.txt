Play Itself Is Sentimental One
Of Great Power Deserving
Its Big city Rims.

ACTING FAIRLY WELL DONE

Reviewer Considers Leading Lady
Incapeble of Expressing the
Emotion Called For.

By Bluvlle McClIrry.

The Community club has added one
more great stage success to tiledril-
ma it has brought to Grinnell in pl -
seating Allen Lungdou Martin's “Sn -
lin’ Through" here Thursday after-
noon and evening, The ploy itself s
a sentimental one of great Dower; its
lung runs in New York and Chicago
are easy to understand after having

‘secn it.

The story of the play is this. Kath-
leen is in love with Kenneth Wayne,
sou of her uncle's confirmed enemy.
Uncle John Carteret forbids 2 mar—
riage of the two, because of the pre-
judice, the cause of which is revealed
in the next scene, which depicts ii.
period of his youth. Both lie and Je-
remiah Wayne loved Moouyeen Clare,
bllt She preferred Caftel'et. On their
wedding night, Wayne appeared as an
uninvited guest, madly drunk, and in
>zlttel'nDting to shoot Carteret, accidenr
tally killed Moonyeerl when she flung
herself in front of'hcv lover. She died
in her lovers arms on her Wedding
night.

Curtoret Secs Spirit.

From that time on Carteret ima.
Lgines that Moonyeen appears to him
every moonlit night. Then she does
not come. Kenneth goes to war and
comes back four years later. The
message is finally transmitted to Car-
terct, through the medium of Moon—
yeen's spirit, that he should relent;
which he does, laud apparently every

one lives happily ever afterward.

The acting in the evening perfor-
mance was, as a whole, fairly- well
done, much better than in the after-
noon showing, it is understood.
There were, however, quite a few
things which could have been better
ed—the lighting, the scenery and the
role of the leading lady. The moon-
light was somewhat perfunctory, to
say the least; the scenery was unus»
ual and rather sparse in places.

Bliss Jerome Too Binom.

Mildred Jerome, who played Kath-
leen, was the one outstanding blight
on the whole production. Her voice
was most unpleasant and incapable
of expressing the emotional qualities
called for in her part. She was ex-
ceedingly vivacious, to be sure, at
times too much so. But the grating
tone of her voice reduced the tense
moments of the play from the beauti-
fully tragic to the ridiculously comic.
In her dying scene in the second act,
it dccply emotional part, the i-asping
strain proved too much and a ripple
of laughter wcnt over the audience.
If she had the voice of Golda Miller,
who played Mary, Moonyecn's sister,
and if this capable actress had taken
the part of Mouuycen and her spirit,
this particular production would have
been much improved. Besides, Miss
Jerome is too buxom for a Kathleen,

Rest of Dust Good.

The rest of the cast playcd Well.
Sheridan Davidson, who took the purl
of the uncle, and Bruce Miller, the
Doctor and Carteret’s friend, proved
two excellent old gentlemen. Willie,
the country boy so hopelessly in love
with Katblccn, was played by Hugh
Studebaker, who provided many at the
intentional laughs of the audience.
Phil A. Boland took the parts of Je—
remiah and Kenneth Wayne and car-
ried them both with a professional re-
serve thoroughly consistent with the
characters. Lorena Tolscu acted as
the maid, Ellen.

The actors had to overcome the
handicap of an audience which came-
late, slammed doors, brought crying
babies and coughed persistently.
which is no small thing.

The compsny will be back in Grins
nell some time next fall. We shall be
glad to see them,~lf they allow their
leading lady to bundle the scenery.

Omaha High School ’Troupers Like to
Play to College Audiences, They Say

"Dovwe'." I’ll say we do!" Martha.
Randall of Martha. Randall's Revue
said when a reporter asked her if she
liked to play to college audiences.
The troupe was interviewed at the
Hotel Monroe after its show at the
Colonial last night.

When the scribes saw the nine
members in street attire, they realized
that another popular hallucination of
the footllghts was blasted. Miss
Randall’s dancers rouge in age from
fourteen to eighteen years and are all
enrolled in Omaha high schools. The
youngest is an accomplished acrobatic
dancer and the others do solos and
dance eusembles. Her black-face ec—

centric dancer is eighteen.

Miss Randall maintains a. studio inl

Omaha and picks

lier troupe from
among her most promising students.
They tour only on week—ends and dur-
ing vacations when the girls are free
from their lessons. Miss Randall
herself is only twenty-one and has
been in theatrical work for ten years.
The girls are unaffected and proved
pleasing couvcrsatiopalists as they
enthusiastically told of their work.
This unusual troupe travels in autos
mobiles. They appear here again to—
night, and tomorrow play the new
Capitol theatre in Newton. From
there they hurry back to Omaha.
Next summer Miss Randall and her
protcgcs are to work under the direc-
tion of the Publix Theatres, one of
the largest theatrical producing and
exhibiting units in the country.

PIUNEEH H‘lE lAﬂES
WASHIW lﬂNIEHl

Bears Rated As Weakest of Teams
Locals Have Met Thus Far
This Season.

To follow a hard trip to Columbia
and a fast gsme against the Missouri
Tigers in which the Pioneers led un—
til the final moments, Grinnell has a
hard battle with the Washington
Bears tonight. The game will be an
attempted come-back after defects in
five straight games.

The Washington five is perhaps the
weakest the locals have yet met.
Their rating is in the lower half cf
the Valley, while the three teams
which have been met so far are the
three Conference leaders. Outside of
being tired from last night's game
and a long trip on the train, the Plus
users should be in excellent shrine to
meet the Bears. There are no in-
juries which might slow up the play—
ers and the offense should lie de—
veloped to the highest degree of the
season. The, workouts this Week were
entirely devoted to perfecting a dam”
ed offense, an entirely new system as
far as Grinucll basketball is con-
cerned.

Although the season from the
standpoint of victories has been me-
diocre, the local hoopsters have run
up a strong record from the stand-
point of close games. The average
number of points made is practically
30 in spite of a nearly scoreless con-
test with Oklahoma university in
which only 16 points were counted.

Freshman Girls Vote
96 Per Cent Against
Smoking For Women

According to a secret ballot taken
in Deon Luella .T. Road's education
class of freshman women, 36 per
cent of them are opposed to co-eds
being allowed to smoke in Grluuell
college.

The question put before the girls
was stated: "Should Grinnell change
its rule prohibiting smoking for woe
men," and all but 4 per cent answered
in the negative. This rule was made
two years agu. according to Miss
Read, by a Vote of all the glrls. The
result of this vo'te should allay the
fears of those who have become
alarmed Eli the apparent attitude of
Grinnell on this question.

The whale discussinn of smoking
for women was raised when several
of Maude Royden's engagements were
cancelled because she indulged iu the
Practice. Considerable publicity has
been given her, both in Grinnell and
outside, and numerious letters have
been coming to President Main con-
coming the attitude 0f Grinneli in
the matte Grinueli's attitude has
been u broadrminded one, the results
of which are thurnllghly vindicated in
the vote of the freshman women,

Perplexity Is Great as Co-eds Date
To Decide Mate

At last the great ouadrsuniul cvcnf
is at hand, and up evening of mutual
revenge is in sight. And from all rcr
ports many difficulties are arising.
E\el‘ since the announcement of tile
Leap Year dance, scol- of vegucsts
have come to this olficc for the estab—
lisllmeut of a column giving advlcc
upon the many problems which cons
flout the datermuking co-cd. Because
of our Sincere sympathy for those not
versed in tllis an, we have madc a
collection of questions, and have
sought answers from the best author-
itics on the campus.

"What," inquires a prep, shalllscy
when I invite him to the dance?" Ac-
cording to Ross Skinny Dvahn, the
only correct thing to ask is, "Are you
busy?” Never is it permissible to in-
uuirc whether one has a date, or
would care to have one. For pure
and unadulterated truth, “Are you bu~
sy " is the best question.

"Shall we cull for them, and it so.
need we take a taxi in case of rain?"
—tliis from Cottage Three. After a
great deal of discussion, the only so-
lution to this is as follows: Have col-

 

for Leap Year Skate

lcgc central call the dorl‘ns and me
form tlle youug man that he has a
caller in Central Then wait in Cell-
tral until he arrives. However, some
olljcction has been offered to this
plan, Elliott Woodruff, for one. does
not believe that this would produce
true reciprocation, for no matter how
late he arrived, he would be kept
waiting. Perhaps, after all. each girl
should provide herself with a mega-
phone and call for her date at his
building. The question of the taxi s
purcly a pcrsoual one. It might be a
strong and valuable hint.

“Must l boost him up the five-cs
cupc for a realistic finale?" and
“Must furnish the cigarcls that
night?” illquiresioll never mind. To
the first we answer that. it is entirely
a question of welsht‘ and pleasure. To
the second we ask only that you re«
member from experience the tempta-
tion that you are putting in his path.

And just a final hint, to prevent
any financial embarrassment. We
understand that no dinner will he
served at the dorms the ‘night of the
dance. .

Missouri Ties Score With Seven

In their game last night against the

have Missouri tie the score with sev-
en minutes to may, and then display
an offensive which was not to be
denied. The Tigers Were victorious
by the score of 38 to 28, but this
game was the best exhibition of has-

Grinnell team this season.

Grinnell This Land.

Yunger, stal- Tlgc' .oiwsm, scored
a goal immediately after the opening
tipcoll but Grinnell soon tool-{the lead
and held it until the last seven min—
utes of play. At this time, Missouri
tied the score at 25 all, and then, led
by Roach and Yuuger, stepped ahead
and stayed there.

For Grinnell, Captain Davis did the
best work, constantly 0ut~§umpin§
Baker, the Tiger center. This belli-
ed the Pioneer to hold the ball most
of the game. For the Tigers, Yunger,
Craig, and Roach played stellar
games, Roach being high scorer of the
game with eleven points. Missouri
did not show the pnwef which most.
critics have credited her with this
season.
