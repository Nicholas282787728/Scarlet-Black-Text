an educational way.

The educational system in China
provides for lower primary schools
tgradcs one through iourt, higher prld
mury schools (grades live and six) and
junior and senior high schools. The
“model" lower primary school in
Techow is houscu in an old temple
and two teachers narc charge ot the
tour grades and lorry or more pupils.
Educational authorities in the city say
there are twenty lower primary
schools in Tecbow but investigation
proves several to he only mediocre
training schools tor temple novitiates.

Notable among the lower primary
schools are two for girls, both or them
sponsored by the Wyckoit school in
order to give more local girls an op-
portunity to prepare to enter the
Wyckolt school.

Two higher primary schools in
Techow, supported by the govern-
ment, have an enrollment of more than
two hundred boys. There are three
other higher primary schools tor boys
in this country.

The higher primary schools charge
an annual fee of two dollars for ”inci—
dentals", the largest single item being
the cost of tea supplied to the stu-
dents. The lower primary schools
charge one penny a day for the same
purpose.
