Quolncions from a book by Dr. lieg—
inold Campbell oi England were used
as a vehicle to present the traditional
view of the nature and the life or
Christ. Dr. Campbell ion the church
of England as an ardent advocate of
the new theology, only to return to
the fold more orthodox than before.
In his book he explains everything
easily, admits éhere ure many serious
and passes
"them by without discussion. Accord-
ing to this writer a ”miracle is not a
violation of s nniural low, “but can

Commenting upon this stalement, Dr.
Patton added that “if it made the sub—

would be the greatest miracle of all.

in passing on to the critical view
of Christ, the speaker made two point-
ed statements: one to the erlect that
the theory of the Fetrine succession
was inserted into the new tesiameht
long after apostolic times; and the
other to the effect ihat "the standing

In presenting the crilicsi point or
view, Dr. Patton showed that some
theologians 'believe that Christ was‘
limited in his actions just as ordinary
men are. Further, besides demanding
a disciocion between God and Christ.
they demand a. distinction between
super~
personal being, and Jesus, the man of
history. According to the, statement of
the venerable Willicul Morn Ward, D.

Brilisll to Millie Expcllition

The narrow path of the eclipse will
begin near Abyssinia,,extend easterly
over the Maldive islands, over Christ-
mas Island (South of Java.) enter the
northwest Coast or Australia on lhe
“Ninety. Mile Beach.” cross Auscrells
and end near New Zealaud. British
astronomical societies are sending an
expedition, starting early in Febursry,
with chiel purpose to test the cele-
brsled Einstein theory.

The northwest coast or Australia
is, sstrohomically, the best piece irom
which lo observe the eclipse. The du—
ration of totality is there the longest,
and weather conditions are excepuonl—
ly favorable. The British party deci —

vastly less promising weather condi-
tluns,'because they regarded the Nine-

‘Ausrruliau Authorities to Cc-opcrllio

Because or the importance or the
Einstein tesm. and or the promising
conditions at the "Ninety Mile Beach"
Dr. Campbell had hoped. to send a
small expedition in that paint, since
no‘ other American expedition ,was in
prospect. He received the immediate
compel-alien of Australian astronomers
and the Australian government and
navy, who have agreed to provide a
ship to assist in the necessary navi—
gscion about Australia, including ia-
cilitics for landing and I'e—Embiu‘king.
Accordingly, university authorities dc-
Clded to enlarge their plans, and or—
gauize a more expensive expell’ on,
worthy of the assistance supplied by
the Australian government.

According to Dr. Campbell, it is nec-
essary to conduct a series or prelimi-
nary night investigations, (or iwo or
three months beiore the eclipse diite.
Consequently, Dr. R. J. Trumpler will
depart from San Francisco on March
31, for Tahiti, and remain there lor
