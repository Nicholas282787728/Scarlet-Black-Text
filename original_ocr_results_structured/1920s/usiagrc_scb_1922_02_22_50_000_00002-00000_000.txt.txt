Criunell is said to he a "friendly"
school—to be a place where all types
of students meet on equal grounds
and are offered eqiiitl opportunity to
make what 'they will of their college
education. More than this. the stu-
dents themselves feel that this repu-
tuiion is well founded and theta“
praise for the "friendly" atmosphere
may he accepted rightfully and with
due modesty. There is not one who
would not be insulted it he were told
that his field of acquaintance was a-
narrow one and that he did not know
his fellow students—did not know
bven all of those who were in the
same class. Everyone connected with
the college would rise in righteous
indignation and slay the speaker-
if conditions permitted, Nevertheless ,
the accusation is true; we do not
know our fellow students.

At the close or the ﬁrst semester, a
number of individuals were selected
at random from the student body and
asked to list the number of their

“THE BUYING OF BOOKS”

In the current issue of "The Atlan-
tic" there is an article entitled "The
Buying of Books" by the Rev. carl s.
Patton of San Francisco, This is of
particular interest on Grinnnell stu-
dcnts in view of the fact that Dr. Phtv
ton was so recently here as Gates
ucmorial Lecturer in connection with
the annual Brothcrhood Conference.

This "Tile buying of
books" comes up for discussion fre~
quently among college students and
it is of interest to note the re-actions
