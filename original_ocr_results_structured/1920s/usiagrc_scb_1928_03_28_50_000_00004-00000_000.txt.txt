dynamics, other outstanding features
were their (reedom and fire, intensely
exhilarating in effect." The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch remarked, “The Minne-
apolis orchestra proved itself a virtu-
oso band, disciplined to the last de-
greera flexible instrument upon
which its director plays with master-
'lul ease and authoritv.”

Vci-hrnggen Brilliant Conductor.

The director, Henri Vei-brugglien. is
a Belgian who has a record of bri _
linnt success as a conductor in Paris,
London, Berlin, Munich, and Petro-
grad. He has been with the Minne-
apolis synihpopy since 1923. In des- :
crihing, the Toledo Times said, "Here
is a veritable little giant ot a conduc-
tor, who plays upon a baton as on
some super instrument. The very air ‘
is electric about Vel‘hrugghen's head.
His musicians feel it ,and the audience
at once senses it,"

The Milwaukee Journal said. "lir.
Verbrugghen revealed himself as a
conductor of breadth and vision and
of magnetic and persuasive personali-
ty. Temperament, insighi, ardor and
impulse belong to him snperlativeiy,
counterbalanced hy poise. taste and
judgment." Every member or the or-
chestra is an artist recruited from
one at the music centers at Europe
or America.

During the quarter of a century that
the Minneapolis symphony has been in
es stence,‘ the citizens or Minneapolis
have contrihnted nearly three million .
dollars for its maintenance in addition .
to the ticket income and other earn-

' lngs. An annual maintenance fund of
