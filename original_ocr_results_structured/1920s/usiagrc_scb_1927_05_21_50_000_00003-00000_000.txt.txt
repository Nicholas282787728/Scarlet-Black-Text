Prince Albert. It belongs. It speaks the lan-
guage. You get what we mean the minute you
lamp 3 load of this wonderful tobacco into the
bowl of your jimmy-pipe and make ﬁre with

a match'.

Cool as*‘a northeast bedroom.

Sweet as a

note from the Girl of Girls. Fragrant as a wood-
land trail. Prince Albert never bites your tongue
or parchcs your throat, no matter how fast 'you

feed it.

You’ll smoke pipe-load on pipe-load
with never a regret.

Buy a tidy red tin of P. A. today. Throw
back the hinged lid and breathe deeply 'of th'ai

teal tobacco aroma.

Then . . . tuck a neat

wall into the business-end of your jimmy-pipe

and light up.

Now you have it . . . thai

taste! That’s Prince 'Albert, Bellows!
