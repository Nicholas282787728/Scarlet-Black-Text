The annual inlerdormitory basket-

ball race will be officially launched
Saturday, when the Lahgan hall A
team and the Smith hall A team clash
in the opening game or the series.
From all reports, every hnilding will
have two strong teams in the field,
and the games should be inst and
close. According to the pressenson
dope Dibble hall and Building Three
should have the strongest teams e‘nr
tered, with the ton-oer appearing to
he the stronger of the two on paper.
Hnwever the real strength of any or

the buildings cannot well he Iigured'

before the teams get into action, and
anyone of the other halls may show
unexpected strength.

The fact that indoor track is just
starting, and that coach Hufl is not
desirous oi having the candidates play
intramural basketball may have n tch.
ing eliect on the prospects oi some of
the teams. Track men are not barred,
hut several do not care to risk nrolp
able injuries by competing in those
games. Building Three and Dibble
hall will he the hardest hit. as neither
Taylor or Scharnweber are expected to
play, and both men were stars on
their respectiro tennis last. year

been drawn up, and is so arranged that
both teams representing each huilding
will get into action each week. only
