“Ghost Butte,” by Catherine Aye, is

A short character sketch, “,Jim Lan—

Jim Lander is depicted as a pioneer
homestender and violinist of versatile
talent. The knack of writing a tanni-
iar tyle, as explained in “How‘to A6»
quire a Familiar Style," seems to come
"hy- making your wl' in; like your
conversation. clear and straightfor-
ward." A sketch, “In the Street-Car,"
has a touch of objectivity suggestive
oi Sinclair Lewis, but lacks the sordid
element which characterizes most of
the work of the author at “Main
Street,"
