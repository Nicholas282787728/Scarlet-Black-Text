The Tuesday and Wednesday beiorc vacation were
orgies oi quizzes inr uniortunnte students. Some students
had as many as tour examinations on one day. while
others had none.

Many protessors have realized the uniairness oi
examinations at the regular interral. ironi the students'
standpoint. and have accomplished ‘their desired ends
through required reports and outside work.

The proposition oi having from two to four quizzes
the day before Christmas vacation is unfair; students are
unable to do justice to any at them. The spirit oi the
season. the tension and rush oi the last day interlere
with study. mailing the grind almost as hard as the usual

The latter rorm ot sei'clittlle has several distinct dis-

caused instructors, is the disregard ior common sense.
