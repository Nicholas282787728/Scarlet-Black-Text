Originality Keynote
0f Cowles and Sherr
Talks Before Confab

"Develop originality on your high
school publicauons." That was the
keynote of two of the headline
speeches holol‘e the High School Press
convention today. Gardner Cowles,
Jr., editor of the Des Moine‘s REGISA
TER~TRIEUNE spoke on ”Over the
Editor's Desk.” while Jack Sh‘err oi
the Bureau of Engraving talked on
"Building the High School Annual "

"A glance over high school papers
indicates a distressing sameness,"
Stated Mr. Cowles. "I Wish some high
school editor had the courage to print
his paper in red ink. Better still, each
issue of the paper Should be managed
by a. different Student, featuring his
own ideas. It would he better if the
REGISTER cup, now awarded for the
best from page makeup, should he give
en to the school having the best origs
inul front page makeup.”

The use of some general idea carried
out through the entire high school an-
nual was stressed by Mr. Sherr. He
cited the development of ”Honor thy
father and mother" by the “Red and
White," Iowa City high school annual
which won the prize for the best year

While psychology has been recognized

”The Dear Departed, ” “The Very
Naked Boy” and Comedy
Given by Theater,

The Experimental theatre presented
its ﬁrst one-act hill of the year this
afternoon at 3:30 in A. R. H. auditor-
ium, in honor of the High School Press
convention. The hill consisted of n
onesact comedy by Stanley Houghton.
"The Dear Departed," an original skit
by Howard Peck and Ross Evnhn, and
one of Stuart Walker's Portmautsau
plays, "The Very Naked Buy,” an ins
terlude before the cu‘rtain.
Infelt Stirs Again.

“The Dear Departed" is a comedy
of middle class English people. Helen
Gertrude Jones as Amelia Slater, and
Ruth Atwater as Elizabeth Jordan
played the parts of two grasping sis—
ters who swished through the scene in
mourning of the vintage of 1900. Lysle
Hartley as Ben Jordan and Holllsler
Snlith as Henry the henpecked, furn-
ished suitable shadows for their
wives. James Infclt as Abel Merry—
weather, the "dear departed," proved
a lively corpse who brought chagrin to
his money-grabbing family, and Eunice
Cutler was convincing as the naughty,

.exasperating Slater child. The play

was directed by ottillie Turnbull Sey-
bolt assisted by Lola carpenter. F‘ran-
cis Prom) acted as property manager.

Interlude Is Farce.

"The Very Naked Roy,” nlaved as an
interlude before the curtain proved to
be a rollicking farce with a dash of
romance and a comic situation rising
out of misunderstanding. Eleanor
Dunton played the role of a sweet, shy
girl, Russell Peterson was her lover.
and Harold Harris was the very naked
boy whose plight was not as serious
as the lovers fesrcd. The play was
directed by Grace Adams assisted by
Josephine Meyer and Mary Stevenson,

The Evalmsl’eck combination, which
made its debut last year in a scene in
"The Fool,” scored another hit ln ta-
day's matinee performance. Their url~
glnal skit consisted of a dialogue be
tween a door mat salesman and
newspaper reporter.

The Experimental Theater orchestra
furnished the music.

“ Get the News" Is Cry of Editors,
Says Mulroy to High School
Press Delegates.

By Dorothy llnbcnstcin,
The Little Ilmlgcr, l-‘ol't llcllgr, Iowa.
(Editor's Note: The following story
was awarded the SCARLET AND
BLACK cup for the best news slory
written by a high school student at
the convention yesterday. There are
no changes From the original and

little editing has been done.)

“Absolute loyalty to your paper,
courage, modesty, a sense of alertness,
a sense of humor, and sympathy are
the fuudanimital qual ies ot a success
ful newspaper man," Jilmes R. Mulroy,
reporter of the Chicugo DAILY NEWS.
told two hundred delegates to the
eighth animal convention of the iowa
High School Press association in the
headline speech of the convention in
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium yess
lei-day afternoon at three o'clock.

M. Mull‘oy, who won the Pulitzer
prize for detective reporting in 1924
because of his work in the Fl'anks'
case, introduced himself as “A coins
mon, garden variety or newspaper
man, everything in the city room, ex»
cept rewrite man."

The famous reporter of DAILYl
NEWS, is a mediumsized, \vell-builtl

eyes, behind his large glasses. Yet,
those same eyes shine brightly wllen~
ever he talks of his work. The prep
school journalists listened eagerly for
over an hour, as he told of his ad—
ventures in news—writing.

Spends Thne Collecting News.

"'Get the n ws.' is every city edi—
tor's wur-cr Mr. Mulroy told the
young scribes. “But the good report-
er spends more time in collecting
news than in writing his story."

While Mr. Mulroy believes a sense
or humor absolutely essential to the
reporter. he told of numerous incidents
when youthful reporters made terri-
ble mistakes when they carried their
cleverness too far.

But courage is even more essential
than humor.‘ "It takes courage to
walk into B. gangster's headquurters,
into a gambling house late at night, or
to descend sixty feet into 2, crumbling
shaft to get a snapshot, as one young
Louisville reporter did, to get a final
and only picture of Floyd Collins'
grave.

"Even more essential than physical
courage is menml courage. If you
lack mental courage, do not expect to
work on a city paper. The tempta-
tions are too great, and after all no
paper is stronger than its reporters. If
you are ever a publisher or up editor,

Basketball Squad
Rounds Into Shape

Return of Veterans Gives Promise
Pioneers Finishing High.

Basketball prospects this seilson in
Gl'lnnell look brighter than they have
in many years previous. The last few
years Grinnell‘s basketball teams have
considered it quite a feat to win more
than two or three games, but this con-
dillou seems destined to cease. \Vitli
fivc lcttel-men and a new coach whose
reputation has been one to be proud
of, the Pioneers should finish high in
the .\ -souri Valley conference this
season. '

The live lettel'niel’l who will be elig-

or guard, and Fall and Mark, guards.
All of these vetertans seem to have
improved over their live! ycar's pcl»
forniances, and should help to make
the Ploneel's a quintet to be feared by
the best teams in the Valley There
are many reserves and freshmen from
last year to make these lettcrmen

this season, and will both probably
sce a good deal at service this year.

deadly an eye for the basket as any
man on the squad. u'liilc Lovcjoy is a
guard who is very adept at handling
the hall.

Wilhelm Promising.
Probably the most promis-
ing candidate from last year's fresh-

man souad is Wilhelm, who lliftys'elths

el' forward or center with equal abil-
ity. Wilhelm is over Six feet, and al—
so has deadly aim for the hoop. An
other member of last Year's freshman
team who will be given consideration
on the varsity ls Corrougll, a guard or
forward. whose flour work is extreme-
ly good. Struhle, a tennis player of
note, is out for the squad this year,
and his speed should help him quite a
hit. Other members of last year’s
prep team who can be counted on to
do their stuff are Schmnedecke, who
has been showing extreme brillianCY
in practice, DeLong, Rose, Sharnborg,
and Briggs.

Censorship of. High School Paper
Is Essential DeWitt Sprague Says

“The high school newspaper is the
most vital expression both of the
school and in the school,” said DeWitt
C. Sprague in a speech given this more
pin; in the Little Theater to the dele-
gates of the iowa High School Press
association.

The purpose of Mr. Spraguc's talk
was two-fold: to sllow the responsibil-
ity and reasonableness of the high
school principal’s censorship or the
school paper; and to explain the im-
portance of the newspaper and its staff
in the school. Three avenues of
thought were used to develop these
aims.

“Censorship is not an enemy to high
school journalism, but rather its best
frlen , . ated Mr. Sprague, It is diffi-
cult to appreciate the task of the high
school principal who is called upon to
systematically censor the school's
publication. For it is not his pur-
pose to suppress student thought, but
to encourage it, He is to be regarded
as the chief executive of the high

 

school, which the speaker compared to
a governmental state.

Speaking of the freedom of the press.
Mr. Sprsgue traced the laws upon this
subject, and explained the relation of
freedom of the press to the high school
paper. "Altlicugh the field of material
in a high school paper is limited, with-
in that field freer comment is nossls
hie."

His third point concerned tlle con-
tent of the school paper and the prob
lem of giving the students what they
want. It is practically impossible
even in the city newspapers to know,
other than by subscriptions, whether
the public is receiving what it wants,
while in high schools with their fluc-
tuating opinions, this is even a more
dillicult ducstion.

Mrs. Sprague also stated that he
wished to cxplodc the idea that a high
school paper is merely an overflow for
the English department. According to
the speaker, it is a vital part of every
school.
