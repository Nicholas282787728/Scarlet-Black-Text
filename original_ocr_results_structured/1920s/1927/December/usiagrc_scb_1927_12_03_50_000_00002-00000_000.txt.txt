disadvantages. Besides the apparent (acts that news»
paper worlr is fostered throughout the state and that the
various schools represented receive journalistic incentive
thereby. there is a decided beneﬁt accruing to Grinnell
itseli. i,

Like the high school track meet, promoted in the
spring by the Honor (1. club, the recent press convention.
which is sponsored by Sigma Delta Chi, is a very import-
ant means or acquainting prospective college students
with Grinnell. Many oi the students enrolled here now
were ﬁrst introduced to the college through either the
track meet or the press convention and perhaps many or
those who have just met here will return to th' r homes
with a growing admiration tor this school.

There is an opportunity also [or Grinncll students
themselves to indirectly ncnedt, lor by exercising their-
hospitality towards these delegates their environment is
encoded just a bit tarthcr. The inllux of high school
students exerts a broadening iniluencc over the entire
campus.

THESE CONVENTIONS.

Conventions as :1 rule are not oi lasting eitective—
ness. Usually they materially beneﬁt only those that
attend them, not the organizations which they represent,
and even then the impressions gained are rarely kept
over a week or two. Quick gathering, quick dispersing
and crowded, concentrated programs, are not inducive to
the retention or ideas, and in tact tend to cancel what»
ever beneﬁt the convention produces.

There are cermin worthwhile features or the Iowa
Hilgh School Press convention, iust concluding its eighth
annual meeting here today, that oitset these obvious

ment.

The head football coach ill. Allies is reported as say»
ing that he is strongly against the non-scouting rule
which the Missouri Valley conference has been playing
under during the season just past. ’ In effect. the rule
in question, which was made at a meeting oi the Missouri
Valley directors last year, forbids members of the confers
encc from Sending men to View their future opponents
in action for the purpose of perfecting a. defense against
their style of play. The main objection raised by the
Ames coach is that spectators are entitled to see the
best possible game that can be produced and that by
eliminating scouting the possibility for intelligent defense‘
is eliminated also, thus producing a haphazard contest’
and ragged playing. 1

The Amcs coach has acted on two presumption‘s:
ﬁl‘Sl, that football is a. gladiatorial contest played solely
[or the amusement of the onlnukel‘s: and second, that
the primary purpose of a. football team is to win games.’
it these two premises aretroe, which we do not admit,“
Llien wily not follow Heywood Broun's advice and hire
zl squad of professional mercenaries? They could tour
the country fur and wide, spreading the culture of their
institutions and giving the spectators reully intelligent
exhibitions. A school's ubillly to Win games would be
dependent only on the amount 01 money it could spend
l0l' Dlnl'cl's' salaries.

The non- collllng rule was drafted by a. group of men
who put quick, clear thinking ahead of pie-arranged
plans of defense. They believed ﬁrst of all in The game
as a mental and physical developer of its devotees, not

OPEN a tidy red tin of Prince
Albert and give your olfactory
nerve a treat. Never have you
met an aroma that had so much
come-and-éet-ir. Some fragrance,
Fellows. And that’s just a starter.
Load up and light up. . . .

Cool as ﬁnal exams.
Mild as cafe rm laitH
mild, but with that rich, full-
bodied ﬂavor that bangs your
smoke-gong right on the nose on
every ﬁre-up. You’ll like this long-
buming Prince Albert in the bowl
of a pipe. And how!

With... All.

——the national joy smoke!

One of the ﬁrst things you
notice about P. A. is that it never
bites your tongue or patches your
throat, no matter how wide you
open the smoke-throttle. It is
one tobacco that never wears out
its welcome. You can stoke and
smoke to your heart’s content,
with P. A. for packing. Get some
Prince Albert now and get going!
