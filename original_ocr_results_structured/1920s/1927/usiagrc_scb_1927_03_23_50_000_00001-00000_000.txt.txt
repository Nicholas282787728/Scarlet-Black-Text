Au unusually wide range for the
choice of an all-ouad basket ball team
is presented this year because of the
wealth of tlle real basketball talent
that has made its appearnce at hand
gymnasium. Probably in no recent
season has such active and continued
i terest been evidenced by all classes,
with the result that this year more
games were scheduled and more play«
ers participated in the serie An ef-
fort has been made to choose the team
fairly upon a basis of consistent abil-
ity as displayed in the tournament
games, disregarding prejudice and
class affiliations,

Fresh Show Promise

The freshmen, winners of the in-
terclass championship by their defeat
of the seniors Monday, have displayed
real basketball throughout the season
and are fully deserving of their two
places on the mythical team. In ad
dition to a ﬁrst team which rompezl
throughout the season undefeated, the
fresh boast a squad of two other fast
teams guaranteed to give real compe—
tition to all comers. it is safe to say
that few classes have started with as
much basketball ability among their
members as the class of 193i.

Fern Teget, captain of the fresh-
man squad, is without doubt the
quad's best bet for jump center. Her
unfailing ability to get the tipoff, hcr
speed on the floor and her accurate
passes from center all combine to
make her ideal for the pivot position,
She has played good, consistent has-
ketball throughout the season.

Honor Women To
Sponsor Exhibit

Cap and Gown nr gs oil Paintings of
Oscar Brousse Jacobson.

An exhibition of original oil paints
ings by oscar El'ousse Jacobson, well
known western artist, will he held
in the "rec” room at the quadrangle,
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday after-
needs, from threelo six o'clock, Cap
and Gown society is sponsoring the
exhibit The collection is valued at
$6,000 and consists of twenty-three
north African paintings, interesting
from the standpoint of color and de-
sign.

Mr. Jacobson is at present director
of the School of rainung and Design
at the University of Oklahoma. Al-
though hc is widely known as a less
turcr, educator, and writer on art
topics, his work in oil painting is his
greatest achievement. The pioneer
spirit is foremost in all he does; in
his painting he disregards the tradi-
tions of the schools; his lectures are
continual pleas for liberality in art
and culture.

Born in Sweden in 1862, Mr. Jacob-
son spent his youth as a cowboy on
the Kansas prairies, He began his
study of art under Birgcr Sandzen at
Bethany college, Lindsborg, and later
was graduated from Yale university.
As a student and traveler he has come
to know the art ot every lnnd, His
latest adventure led him into the Afrir
can desert ‘Irom whence he has just
returned after a year’s stay, bringing
with him a collection of the Saharan
arts and crafts in textiles, rugs, Cops

for a book on the natives. He also

Building in

With the filial game to be played
this week-end between Clark and Dili-
ble halls for the intramural indoor
baseball championship, the race has
assumed exactly the some proportions
that it had last winter when the same
buildings battled it out in the final
basketball game. Clark has yet to
play Langan hall, which game will
be played Thursday afternoon.

Dibble won their fourth game of
the series from the Kelly stable team
Saturday by a 7 to 4 score. The Court
house team started the game at a fast
clip, rolling in three counters the
first inning, holding the lead practise
ally the whole game.
Game Hard Fought

The last inning iound Dibble lead-
ing 7 to 2, but the Kelly team loaded
the bases and scored two men on a
misplay by the judges. Arnold was
retired as he attempted to steal third
on the last play of the game.

The game was hard fought through
out, superior fielding by the intra-
mural champs being the deciding -fea»
ture of the contest. if Clark turns
back the Langan team, the Dibble»
Clark battle will definitely decide the
intramural champion in the indoor
division of the national pastime. but
if the present ball champs lose to
Langan, a Clark hall win will only
give them a tie for first honors.

Cast Begins Work
On‘ Contest Plays

Parts Not Deﬁnitely Assigned For

Casts Which Will Go
To Chicago.

Work has already begun on the
next group of plays to be given by tho
Experimental Theatre. A bill oi one
act plays for A. R. H. on April 8 and
an outdoor production of Midsummer
Night's Dream for some time in May
are being arranged. The casung of
“The Valiant.” the contest play; "The
Love of r te,” a farce: and “A Mid-
summer N ht's Dream" is nearly
complete.

Two strong casts for “The Valiant"
have been chosen, but according to
Mr. w, Angus, the individuals are not
definitely assigned and shifts in the
lineup may be made. This play in
particular must be properly cast be-
cause it is the contest play.

Is Pr ou Play

“The Valiant" contains a cast of
four men and a girl. The scene is
laid in the warden's office of a state
prison. The time is late one rainy
night. At the beginning or the play
the warden and a Catholic priest, the
prison chaplain, are talking about a
self-confessed murderer who is to be
hung shortly after midnight. They
are both convinced that he is going
under an assumed name in order to
shield someone and try as they will
they can not succeed in prying
any information loose from the man,
Both like him, however, and the war-
den treats him with unusual kindness.
The convict‘s execution is postponed lyy
the intercession of the governor so
that a young girl may be allowed to
interview the prisoner with a view to
identifying him as her brother. Ber
fore her scene with the condemned
man the warden coaches her on how
it is best to proceed. Then follows
the scene between her and the prison-
er, a scene too powerful and moving
to he disclosed'cxcept in a prcscnm
tion of the play.

The denonement is such as to leave
the audience hushed and breathless.
The four principal roles in the play
are extremely difficult and it is hard
to say which is the mast exacting.
The central figure is the convict who
is the Valiant.

Plot Is Humorlvus

“The Love of Pete" is set at a rum-
mage sale, The saleslady is a bonus
tiful young society girl loved by one
Peter who has proposed numerous
times. He vows he would do anything
or give anything for, but just then the
customers begin to pour in and Peter
is concealed behind a screen. His re-
cent vow is put to test in that first a
coat and then a shirt and so on are
taken from him until there is nothing
left him except the screen, and then
another society girl comes in to take
that away.

Besides the intensity o[ the first
play the novelty of the same play by
two different casts should be an add
etl attraction to its presentation. The
committee of judges will decide upon
individuals, not upon the casts as a
whole, and the audience will have
some vote in the matter of the final
casting.

Spring, ill" season of proposals and

it is neither bird nor beast, but still it
has all the qualities of both and is

Weltkind readers, I attended a col-
lege function the other night at which
I was much amused and ediiled. The
function was a dance, a brawl in other
words, such cxcitements, dunt ask.
The music was clever, but it seemed
much exasperating that all of the fed»
turcs were played with the members'
of the orchestra's hands.

Such dancing ~ it was Worse than
the May {etc last year. I mean there
were more ups and downs than Perse-
plicne's ts to her mother and then
back again to Pluto. I spent the whole
evening trying to find out
what some of the women were
trying to see that they made their
partners boost them up so often, and
right in the middle of a dance too.

the women was terrible to behold 011%
