The elephant is man’s most intelligent helper.

An elephant is much larger than the electric

“yarder” has the power of twenty elephants; it

handles clusters of logs;

it works dependably,

Twenty elephants would eat daily 10,000 pounds
of green food, which a corps of attendants must
gather. A motor “eats” nothing but electricity,
