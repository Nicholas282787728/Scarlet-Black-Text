The appearance or the Minneapolis symphony arches
tra at Herrick chapel Saturday atternoon was an event
ot great interest and signiﬁcance to the local chapel,
Grinnell has long been disposed to reel pride when music
is mentioned, and rightly so. The wealth of opportuni-
ties tor the hearing of good music which Crinnell pron
vides, the excellence oi raculty and student talent which
is constantly displayed, and the general appreciative at
mosphere which accompanies concerts here are all indi

cativc or the high place which music occupies in our col-
lege lite. In view or this evident love and appreciation

for the best in music, the response ol the audience to the
symphony concert last Saturday is worthy or note.

In all justice to the audience it must he said that
they were at all times attentive to and appreciative oi the
artistry and musicianship which Mr. Verorugghen and
his orchestra displayed, Their response to the matchiess
interpretation '0: the Tschaikowsky symphony-was in
every way worthy or the orchestra's, brilliant and {i4
nished rendition or that great composition. What is sur-

prising, however, is that the a’lternoon's greatest outbursts
of applause followed, mm the Tschaikowsky Symphony.

but Mr. Ferguson‘s encore "0n the Road to Mandalay.”
Nothing could he farther from our intention than to dis-
parage this number or Mr. Ferguson’s interpretation or
it; both were beyond doubt luliy deserving oi the m‘ﬂtlul‘d
which they received. What interests us it the unexpected

‘it is smudged, blurred, dirtied.

and spontaneous response of an audience professcdly ed-
ucated to an appreciation oi the best in music. and per-
liaps unconsciously a little inclined, as most audiences
arc. to a Sellrcolllmendntol’y attitude toward that appre-
elation,

It is no disgrace to be more highly appreciative oi
“0n the Road to Mandalay" than or the Tscilailtowslry
Symphony No. 4 in F mine in (act, it is exactly the
natural appreciation of one whose musical education is
as yet not highly advanced. Neither does an appreciation
til the symphony preclude the thorough enjoyment of a
more popular composition. But the tact remains that the
concert ol’ last Saturday gave unmistakable evidence of
the type of compositions which Grm’nell in general most
thoroughly alld heart r enjoys.

The response of the Grinneil audience is something
to be rceogn ed, not criticized. It should be taken for
what it is worth, and not palliated with alihis concerning
variety, or the relief from a program heavy with classie
cal compositions. It should he a reminder that the gener-
al body or Gl'inllell students are yet in the elemental sta—

ges of musical appreciation. and that their only means ior
advancement lies in a recognition oi this tact and a con-

scious etiort to alter it. An audience. which still enjoys
its Speaks more than its Tsehaikowsky cannot afford to
he too complacent in matters or musical taste.
MIRIAM McNALLY.
Tilli MUDDY WHEEL.

In this age oi the “gloomy" Dean and a pessimistic
outlook on the world and its processes, we are getting
an exaggerated idea oi oiir own importance for a change,
Dollbtless we are insigniﬁcant items in the scheme oi
the universe; doubtless we are degenerate types 01 mil»
nial lire, sub-normal creatures, unable to exist in a sane
world, dependent on coddling and cozening tor life.

We are in a dilemma. We dare not go back, for that
way lies degeneration. We are not permitted to stand
still. There are too lnzuly gadJlies loose about the
world. And according to these selfrallpointerl guideposts.
we cannot go torward. it is utterly impossible tor the
human race to advance; as a matter or tact, whether we
like it or not, we are told that we are rapidly retrogresss
ing. There is no hope for us, We are doomed to swiit
extinction. and our petty structure oi civilization will col-
lapse with our downiall.

Let us compare this disreputable world to a wheel.
We are a spot on the rim or this wiieel. As it revolves,
the spot is now on top in clean air, now on the bottom
in oozy mud. So goes our civilization. We are now on
top with a great were oi moral uplilt, of scientitic pro»
gress, oi intellectual wholeness in an atmosphere of to-
lerance, sympathy, energy, sanity. But the wheel rolls

on and we are suddenly shoved down illto the mud or
reaction All that had seemed to be good and practical

hctore is now visioned through a film at gray—brown;

The mud clings to
the wheel. holding it back. Soon, however, the wheel

works out, and we are carried to the top again, This is
movement of some kind. for this unattached wheel must
roll somewhere after all its elforts. As it goes. our on!-
look Chunges, New surroundings are about us. This
clump of grass, once so large, recedes into the distance;
that becomes larger as we approach it. Let us hope that
the wheel is moving forward, that We will soon be out
of this muddled air. We have no reason tn suppose that
we are moving backward; we will then assume that we
are moving forward. It is pleasdnter to think so.
