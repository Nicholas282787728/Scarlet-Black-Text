"The whole moral tone or Christian
civilization is melting, You are living
in an age anillagaus to those of tlle'
Sophists and Confucius; you are inc»
ing the same problem today, [but or
moral chaos and disintegration," said
Dr, wnl Durant, lecturing on “The
Greatest Thinkers in Philosophy and
Solellce" in He k chapel Friday
evening. Dr. Durant, author oi “The
Story of Philosophy" was introduced
hy‘Prof. .l. D. Stoops, head of the den
partment of philosophy at Grinnell
college,

"The period of Confucius was Sims
ilar to the period of Greek history in
which the ancient faith of the educdtr
ed classes had disintegrated and mor—
ality was in danger of failing with the
celestial substructure. Our only solu-
tion for our age is that of Contains
and Socrates; we cannot go back and
recapture the old faith in all its liter—
alness and beauty. This whole gen»
erauon shall he one of gre'ut sadness,
but we shall have to go forward, Only
through the spread of intelligence can
‘We catch-up with the disintegration of
our character. If we cannot do this
by habit, or by fear, we must do it
by wisdom.”

Greatness Is Influence

Dr. Durant prefaced his selection of
the ten greatest thinkers by a qual—
.ifying of terms. “The criterion for
greatness," he said, "must be inde-
pendent of all prejudices, objective as
well as subjective. An objective crir
tel—ton of greatness is influence. How
profound, permanent, and widely
spread was his influence upon mans
kind; this is a test of a great man.

“And what is a thinker? it is ini-
possible to define thought, save to say
that it is the contradiction of elements
in deliberation, and their union in a
total response to the total situation.
The word thinker will he used to in-
dicate a man who is primarily a
thinker, not the founder of a religious
faith in particular."

Dr, Durant named Confucius as the
first great thinker. “If he founded a
religion, he probably did not realize
-lt. His thought was not a relation be—
tween a human being and a super—
na‘tural being. it'was a moral philos~
ophy. He said that the difference lie-
tween man and animal is very littl.,
and that most people throw that away
iintelligonce. The Confucian phil—
osophy, that calm, imperturbable spir—
it infused into his people which stilll
remains, this is a measure of his in-
'ilnence. '

.. oiuits Sociutes

“India, Egypt, Judea produced res
llgious civilizations, but they lacked
the secular element. They left re-
ligion, art, and politics, but not phil-
osophy or science. In Greece, I omit
Socrates, because we do not know‘
whether the Socrates we know ever er-
isted. I name Plato, who when he
lived taught a hundred students; and
now that he is dead he teaches a bun-
dred thousand. And Aristotle, 1 think
of him not as a man but as an ene
cyclopedia, has an influence greater
that that of any other thinker. Too
great, in fact, for it dominated the
Middle Ages and English thought.

“The Middle Ages reproduced the
Hindu, Hebrew, and Egyptian uieo
an age in which the church unified
Europe by the power or its word, and
left cathedrals instead of philosophy.

“Copernicus, the first modern man
who enunciated the little proposition
that the earth is not the center ofthe
world, wrought the greatest change in
the history of human intellect. He
made God remote; made men think of
him not as human, but as a whole
spirit and force of the universe. Frans
cis Bacon was the voice of that age,
and he became the most powerful man
of modern times, a statesman and a
philosopher. Isaac Newton represent-

here last evening to the tune of so to‘

est that has been played this season
on the local floor, It was the first
one that the Crimson and Blue ma.—
clnhe has won this season at home.

The Jayhawker crew jumped into
the lead at the start and never were
headed. At the end of the first per-
iod the Jayhawk machine was leading
20 to 8. About the middle of the sees
and period Coach F. c. Allen began to
feed his reserves into the Kansas line-
up, the second string players continua
ing to pile up the score. The Grin-
nell players seemed unable to pene-
trate the Jayhawker fivemah defense.

At the start of the game the Iowans
attempted to draw the home clt'ib out
from underneath the basket but the
method failed. Doffing played a. good
game for the visitors but his team
mates were not able to cooperate with
him. Al Peterson, Jayhawker center,
was high point man of the game with
four field goals and two free throws
for ten counters, The ansas team
has now won six and lost two games
in the Valley race.

lit-tore F on Group r

Opening the current debate season,
before a fan ized crowd in A, R. H.
auditorium Thursday evening, fresh-
man teams from Drake and Grinnell
clashed vigorollsll’ on farm relief.‘
llarold Bentley, Joseph Lee, and Ernest
Stowe presented many arguments to,
show that the McNary-Haugen act is
unsound, w ilc colburn, Musgrave, and
Hill, the ﬁl-strl'ear speakers from Des
Monies, upheld the hill in convincing
fashion.

The burden of the affirmative case
was that the farmer needs relief, owing
to the inherent difficulties of liis our
cupation. The McNary Haugen bill
is the proper measure to he adopted,‘,
because it does not for prices, it isl
workable, and it will continue the sur-
plus of products which keeps the world ,
from starvation. This bill, according:
to the Drake speakers, will merelyoo‘
for agriculture, what the protectivel
tariff has done for industry.

Gl‘ilulell Attacks Bill
The Gl‘lnnell team attacked the bill,
on the grounds that it would increase‘
a surplus which is already the cause
of the far-mere' troubles, and hence
would not give them relief but make
their position worse. While subsidies
have been granted to other industries,
they were for the purpose‘ of stimulatr
ing production, not of cutting it down,
which is the need of agriculture.
Following the formal argumcnisi the
audience joined in on open fortnn dis-
cussion, directed by Prof. Edward
B. T. Spencer, the presiding officer of
the evening. Throughout the debate
both teams employed a conversational,
direct style of speaking, which was in
marked contrast with the traditional
oratorical manner. The debaters in-
jecLed‘ considerable humor into their
remarks.

Debate At Allelnlllt

0n the same evening a varsity team
consisting of Emerson Schill, John
Spencer and Frank Dewey defended
the McNai—y-Haugen’proposal before a
farm bureau audience at lineman.
against a varsity team from Drake.
An audience decision was given, in
which the house di’vided evenly, 26 far
vol-lug the bill and 26 opposing it.

Little Philosophy Is a Dangerous

Thing, Asset-ts

Noted Philosopher

 

liy Margaret u‘rishanr

“A little philosophy is a dangerous
thing." Will Durant told a Scarlet and
Black reporter yesterday after-noon.
“Of course I believe that every stile
dent who likes philosophy should dab-
hlc in it, but if he prefers base ball,
why waste time on philosophy?"

When asked, “Are morc laymen
really becoming interested in philos-
ophy?" b r. Durant hesitated and then
said, “Well, I don’t know. Perhaps
the sale of my book is merely due to
our general natura‘l development. The
same is true in,all fields-literature
and art especially. When people be—
gin to throw off the opinions they
were born with, when they begin to
be conscious of themselves, they nu-
turally turn to philosophy.

"Bill. after all, it is human life that
people are interested in. They are
interested in philosopher , not their
ideas. Perhaps I seduce them when I
use biographies as a method of ap-
munch.”

From 1914 until his resignation a
few months ago, Mr. Durant was pros-
ident ot the Labor Temple school of
philosophy at Second street, New
York. The school is situated in a
poor district of the city and caters to
students of modest means. Thirty
cents is the average cost of one lec-
ture. In speaking of the school, his
present relation with which he calls a
“platonic affection," Mr. Durant said,
"You soc, down there if you don't say
what you mean they get up and walk
out on you. There are no grades and
no credits."

At the beginning of the interview
Mr, Durant had declared he was ready
to talk on any subject from Mary
Pickford to college suicides. When
held to his proposition in the case of
the latter subject he laughed andsaid,
“Well, one of the newspapers said that
a victim had just been reading my
hook before he killed himself. Per-

haps he hadn't read (:tr enough,"

Sherman Allison, the second Grin-

absence from practice for several days
because of sickness will no doubt
handicap him in no little respect.

PHEEINENl NNNN NNNNNNUES NEW

ENH BNLEEEE MEN

Assist Students

Finances.

A new ﬁnancing plan for college men
at Grinnell, which gives promise of
becoming an epoch-making innovation,
has just been announced by President
Main. Under this plan men students
or ability, initiative, and good charaov
ter may ﬁnance their college course at
Gl‘iltllell to the extent of $1,000, through
a combination “scholarshiploan” plan
which has been worked out by Presi-
dent. Main in collaboration with the
J. c. Penney foundation.

in his freshman year each man se-
lected will receive his full tuition, $250,
as an outright gift. it he makes good
as a freshman, in his sophomore year
and each year following he will receive
half his tuition, $125, as a gift, and the
balance will be loaned him on easy
terms, not to be repaid until he has
begun to earn.

Colors Entire Trillion

The whole four years' tuition there
fore, will be provided for, so that the
students efforts during the school year
and in the summer vacation will not
have to be bu 'dened with it. of his
four years' tuition $625 will be given
him as a scholarship, leaving the $375
as a loan to be paid back. Average
tuition for the four years‘will be only
S94 a year for these men, which is
lower than the tuition in most state
universities.

During the present year this plan
has, been quietly tried out on a small
scale. Five men from the freshman
class. and five men fromeach of the
three upper classes, are enjoying the
beneﬁt of these scholarships, The
plan has proved both feasible and sab-
isfactory both to the college mill to the
beneficiaries, so that its extension to
a greater number of men depended
only on means to ﬁnance it.

Sixty men will have the beneﬁt of
this method for the neXL college year.
Fifteen men in the freshman class on-
tering next September will receive full
scholarships of $250 with the promise
that if they meet expectations not
only soholastically but as all-round
men they will be awarded scholarships
and loans which will take care of their
tuition for the rest of their course. and
the total sum which they will have to
pay back, when they am able, will be
only $375.

To Commence Next Full

Fifteen men from the present fresh-
n'isn class, and an equal number from
the present sophomore and junior
classes, will be awarded scholarships of
$125 for next year, and will be granted
a loan of the same amount, payable
after they hive graduated.

As time goes on and more funds be—
come available it is expected to enlarge
this scholarship-loan plan so as to.
meet the needs of every deserving
man who wants to come to G 'nnell.
It is a fundamental part of President
Mftln's plan of developing Grinneu as
a college for men, and it recognizes the
fact, according to President Main's
statement, that an education at Grin-
holl is a business asset, ,and that stu~
dents should, Lo a reasonable extent,
bounce it on a business basis, in this
case financing tln-ee-eighths of their
tuition uhilc the college does the rest

It also recognizes the fact that. men
are dependent on their own efforts to
get a College education much more gen-
erally [Linn Women, and that. in many
cases a man faces a graduate profes
sional course after college that will
postpone his earning two or three
Years.

The loan idea is being developed in
other ways also, especially through
the Harmon foundation which loans
money to students, and which has been
available to Gunnell men since its
establishment.

Considerable funds which have come
to the college within the last few
months make the extension of the
scholarshiploan plan possible at ones
