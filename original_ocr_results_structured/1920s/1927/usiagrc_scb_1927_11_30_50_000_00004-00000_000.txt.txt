On Twelve o’Clock

Hours for Parties

The Student Councll. meeting last
Monday night, decided ill favor of
twelve o'clock hours for nights of
house parties and a committee com-
posed of Howard Peck, chairman, Carl
Kunath and Pauline Aitaffer was ap-
pointed to present the matter to the
faculty. The contention is that so
large an expenditure as is necessary
for house parties, the tilne spent on
them, and the fact that formal: have
twelve o'clock hours, warrants half an
hour more on these special occasions.

The Lantern society. including its
faculty members, passed a unanimous
resolution [or later hours and present-
ed it to the Student Council,

The matter is now up to the facility,

Court Orders Coed
Be Reinstated Who
Is “Not the Type”

Syracuse, N. Y. (By New Student
Service)7She Was not the ”Syracuse
type," Rnd "there had been minors," so
lliss Beatrice Anthony, almost it year
ago, was asked politely to Withdraw
from the univcl‘s If. She did, but not.
Content with the meager explanation
ortercd her by Syracuse deans and as—
sisthnt'deuns, she took the matter to
court and thereby stated started an
interesting bit of litigation that is far
tron. ended,

The universi , ordered by a
suprema court justice's decision to res
instilte the banished student who was-
n’t the “type," has made ready for
tended combat, With no more explan»
Titian than it offered when it look its

first step in the ouster epic, it has
entered an appeal trom the decision
in Miss Anthony's favor, Hostilities.
now adjourned, will rccommence prob-
ably ill January,

When Miss Anthony could get no
lnore explanation than the curt “not
the type" for her summary- dismissal
sllc appealed to the court. The unis
versity, however was not inclined to
expand on its original statementseelc
ing reiugc and authority in the pledge,
acknowledging attendance to he a
privilege and not a right," which all
Syracuse students must sign

The court thought otileri e,
Justice Edward N. Smith declared the
pledge void and without legality, and
the university, as a semipuhlic insti‘
tiltion, without authority ill dismissing
without stating the cause With one
judicial strobe great relolcing was
brought to many students and great
sorrow to many deans.

But the university is tenacious
From Chancellor Charles w. Fling
down to the merest olticial ilunhey.
the university’s right to unqualified
dismissals is still a matter or tlrln
ialth, despite Judge Smith to the con-
trary. So the fight goes on, and in
the meantime Miss Anthony, rudely
separated from her educational career
at the beginning of her senior year.
awaits the ﬁnal word irom on high,
