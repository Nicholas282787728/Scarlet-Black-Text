YOU ARE GRL NELL’S GUESTS.

You who are visiting in Grinnell at the Homecoming
celebration over this week-end are guests of Grinncll.
Drake students who are attending the game are not our
enemies, though the feeling between the two schools is
sometimes intense, You are our friendly rivals and we
Want you to have a good time while you are here. Any
stranger in Grinnell need not hesitate to ask a favor or
any person Llere who seems in any way to resemble a stir-
dent. Homecoming is your day and we want you to make

the best of it this year and return again in the future.

Why should students be compelled to wear uniforms

should they be iorccd to accept the attitude of an older
generation which is unsympathetic with their ideals? The
one way to prevent war is to prevent thought or war.
