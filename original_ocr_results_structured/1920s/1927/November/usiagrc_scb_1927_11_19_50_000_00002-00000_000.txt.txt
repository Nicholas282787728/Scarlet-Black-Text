Section 4 oi the land grantact under which Iowa State

chemistry. Furthermore “The national deieusc act docs

act," wrote the late secretary OI War \Veeks m 1924.

The Iowa legislature has left the courses at Iowa
State up to the trustees or the college and has shown a
tendency to'lcave curricular matters in the state schools
up to the board of education. Consequently it appears
that either the schools themselves or the state hoard can
decide the matter.

Although we do not have military training at Grin-
neii, student opinion here is just as opposed to its compul-
sory practice as are the students at the state college and
university. We trope that the deciding bodies in this
controversy will take into consideration the attitude oi
those whom their action will directly aifect rather than
the crying or the speech-makers.
