movement oi the population By 1550
Iowa was starting to produce corn, Il-
linois had been growing corn tor a tow
years, and with Wisconsin, was liar
ginning the production or wheat Lat-
er the production or wheat became the
prominent activity of the Red River
Valley in the Northwest.

In this great region or the Middle
West, declared rrolessor lierk, the
rest or the country had round its food
producing area. This area was being
depended upon tor the nations corn.
wheat, and meat.

A striking point brought out by the
lecturer, and hearing out his statement
that the nature of a region's soil will
have great intluence upon its people,
was that beginning about 1550, the
area committeetl to staunch Repub—
licanism was almost exactly the region
over which the glaciers had spread in
bygone ages. Just belore the Civil
War the glacial area was still Re-
publican. but the Middle West states
immediately to the south, and out oi
the glacial area were voting the com—
promise ticket. This last region's
market lay to the South, as n ell as to
the East. Professor Mei-k showed
charts oi Presidential elections down
as late as 1896. and still the area or
Republicanism conformed to the area
passed over by the glacier.

"so it ls," the Harvard lecturer said
in concluding. “that a soil structure
will very largely determine a region's
social and political structure,"

Professor Mark's next lecture will
be tonight at 7:15 in A, R, H. auditor-
ium. He will speak on "The Occupa-
tion of the Gulf States.”
