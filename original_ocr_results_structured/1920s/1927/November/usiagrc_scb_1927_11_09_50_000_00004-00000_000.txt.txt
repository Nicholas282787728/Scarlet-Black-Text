the Unrted States,’ By 1825, Spain
and Russia had withdrawn, and Eng-
laud and the United States tried to
ciiect a compromise. Since the United
states desired the harbors at Puget
Sound, and Great Britain sought con-
trol oi the riioutlr or the Columbia
nirer, they ﬁnally agreed upon joint
occupation oi the Oregon territory.

At this time the fur trade in this
region was practically monopolized by
Boston and New York merchants. The
Yanlree trader would sail around Cape
Horn into the Faeilie Ocean ami up to
Puget sound, where he would give the
indrans merchandise, rum, and tar
bacco tor the \illuzlblc itii- ot the sea
otter. From Alaslta lic worrld proceed
to the Hawaiian islands, where he
would get sandal-Wood and other ti‘op'
icai products. Sailing to Canton, he
exchanged the this and wood ior silk:
and tea, with which he would return
to Boston.

Trading Campruiirs t'tnripota.

Following the war oi 1312, two Br
ish trading companies. the r rtli-u'cst
company and the Hudson Bay corn-
pariy, attempted to liiealt down the
Alum an trade by clltrtlil'onl coiiipctir
tiorr l-‘iunlly, by 1830.1hc Hudson Bay
company llil in control, and all Amer-
ican competition was drireri out.
“Therefore.” the lecturer said, “tile ob;
taiuing oi the drsprrtcd area by the
United States, was the process oi
breaking the strangle—hold ot the Hurt
son'lsay company on the economic liie
ot the Oregon to err."

in 1831, tour lndia appeared at St.
Louis asking ior- niis onarrcs to in
struet them in the Christian religion.
Answering this call were Daniel and
Jason Lee at New York. who located
in the Willamette valley. At the same
time as the Panic or 1337 was pushing
people westward, the iavorable reports ,
.oi the Lees were pulling people into
that territory. By 1843, a colony oi
approximately 3,000 American pioneers
had settled in Willamette valley, south
oi the Columbia river. The rich soil,
an excellent climate, an abundance oi
rarniail, and a sutiiciency or timber,
which, however, did iiot encumber the

' soil, all tended to moire it a desirable
region to inhabit. l

Two years later. the Hudson Bay
company abandoned For-t Vancouver
and shiited its base to Fort Victoria.
This was signiﬁcant in that it showed
that the ..Englishmen ..oi intelligence
realized the nselessness oi the Colum~
hia river as a highway to the sea; it
otter-ed also an opportunity to surl'enr
der the river and territory to the
United states, The chiei reason tor
the change or station or the company
was the great tear that Sir George
:snnpson, the leader oi the Hudson Bay
company, had for the American pio-
neers. According to a treaty drawn up
in 1845 by Lord Aberdeen, Great Erit-
ain ceded the disputed territory to the
United States, and the two countries
agreed that both or them should have
