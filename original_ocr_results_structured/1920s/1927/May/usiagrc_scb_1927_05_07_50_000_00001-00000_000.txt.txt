Gard Expl‘uins Interiiewiug

"The most interesting interviews
are often with people who say very
little, or nothing at all,” Wayne Gard
told the members ot the press cou-
venuon Friday afternoon, while
speaking on "The interview."

"There are two classes of inter
views," Mr. \Gard continued, "those
with important persons who may or
may not have something to say, and
those with persons who have some.
thing important to say. interviews
with important persons are usually
group interviews. There is also an.
other type of interview, the canned
interview. The reporters are given
mimeographed statements of remarks
certain persons have said and have no
opportunity to ask the person any
ouestions. This type is being used
largely by publicity men.

"it is essential to know the voca-
tions and avoczltions of the person be»
ing interviewed, also to be persistent
and unwilling to he battled, and to
ask pertinent questions.”

Cnsvrell stresses Revenue.

Mr. G. 1.. Caswcll in speaking on
"The Business of Newspaper Publish-
ing" emphasized the idea that a mag-
azine or periodical of any hind that
one mgiht look for might have excels
lent editors and stories but it cannot
run with these alone. There must be
revenue to pay for the production.

“The business end of a newspaper
ls bringing in enough and a little more
revenue to pay for the cost of opera-
tion," he said. "The three sources of
newspaper revcnue, namely: subscrlp~
tions. job work, and advertising should
be enough to more than cover costs."
Mr. Caswcll concluded with a reminder
that the business and journalistic
sides of the periodical must cooperate.

the Baptist college class next Sunday
morning. All students are invited to

But this evolution of the newspaper

several modern changes which are

Professor Smith regarded the mod—

well groomed for the field events.

Brown or Univei ity high, Iowa City.
was the outstanding athlete of. the
morning. Winning his beats in both
hurdle and, dash events, he was never
pushed. His time was the best in
the 120 yard high hurdles and in the
century dish. His time on the ﬁrst
was 13.3 and on the second 10.4.

Werish of Colfax was the class ot
the hold in Die shot put. He heaved
the twelve pound ball better than to

Gardner Tillies Hurdles.

Gardner of West Chester made, the
best time in the 220 yard low hurdles,
setting an easy pace and out—striding
his nearest competitor by several
yards. His time of 27.6 was four—

nearest opponent, Brown of Univer—
