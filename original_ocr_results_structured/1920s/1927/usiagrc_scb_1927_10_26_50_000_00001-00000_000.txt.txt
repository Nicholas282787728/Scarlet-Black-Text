iMust Interpret American History
By Western Migration, Says
Merk Last Night.

SAYS WEST FEEDS NATION

East Is Conservative, Orthodox;
West Progressive, States
Harvard Lecturer.

"We cannot interpret American his
tory unless we interpret it in terms of
western migration.” said Prof. Fred~
erick Mel'k, in the first of a series of
lantern slide lectures on the "History
of the West" which he delivered to an
audience of 350 in the A. R. H. al'lllr
itol‘iiim lnst night.

"The frontier has been, in a large
measure, responsible for the era vth
of the spirit of independence, iudi
uulism and democracy in America; it
has influenced politics, religion, and
finance; and it has developed a desire
for innovation and experimentation,”
Professor Merk continued in explana-
tion of the importance of the West to
the nation.

Excrts fuilucncc Early.

The Harvard exchange lecturer dc-
clared that even as early as the begin.
ning of the nineteenth century the
West was exerting great influence on
the nation’s policies. it was the West.
he said, which instigated the war of
1812 because frontiersnien feared that
the British were inc ng the Canadian
lndians to make raids and commit um-
rages upon the Americans. That the
impressment of American seamen, and
the injury done to American sea, trade
by the British, the ostensible reasons
advanced for the War, had little or no
weight-may he proved by the fact that
New England, which would suffer
most under these conditions, threaten-
ed secession should America embark
upon a war with England, according
to Professor Merk.

The Harvard professor stated that
the West not only exercised enrly poi-
iticsi influence but was of great econ—
omic importance as well, for “From
1360 onwards the northwest has fed
the nation."

Contributes Brynn.

Other important ways in which the
West affected the nation the lecturer
said, were in its contributions to mans
hood suffrage, the party system, the
"wildcat system" of banking and
speculation, and in its producing Wll~
lldm Jennings Bryan.

Turning from the contributions of
the West to the character of the early
frontiersman, Professor Mark said.
that on the credit side, the early west—
ern emigrant had individualism, initi‘
ativc, and independence. This sense
of independence in regard to the cell»
trul government was expressed by
Jefferson in his epigram, "That gov.
ernmeut is best ‘Whlch governs least."

Some of the frontiersman's less
praisewcrtby characteristics, accord-
ing to the Harvard professor, were his
uncouthness, crudeness and reckless»
ness in wasting and exploiting natural
resources This last trait, he said.
still persists in the American character
as a relic of the frontier clays.

Migration “Greatest Movement."

The professor, however, emphasler‘.
the benefits of the western migration
which he termed “The greatest move-

Irish Hold Grudge
Against Local Men

Marquette Eleven Plans Revenge
On Pioneers Next Saturday
At Milwaukee.

lrish memories may or may not be
short. But there are at least eleven
of them up at Marquette which 'rcmem-
her a game with the Pioneers a year
ago that ended 17 to 2, and it wasn't
an frish triumph. Saturday Marquette
has decided to take full blood atone-
ment for the six quarterbacks and two
dozen linemen who failed to stem the
tide last year. Crinnell warriors are
equally deter-mincd to spoil a Milwau-
kce Homecoming with a Pioneer vic-
tory.

Dopesters haven't as yet decided the
issue, but they are willing to admit that
the battle will he a thriller. The lrish
linemen are big, the Irish backs are
fast, and the Irish hearts are aching
for victory. Whether size, speed and
desire can win will be decided over
the weekend.

Marquette Beats Army.

Early in the season Marquette won
the praise of critics when she held the
Army to a 12 to a score. Later de»
velopments showed that the Army
wasn't all it was cracked up to he, so
the glory of the feat was dimmed.
Saturday, the team took a 14 to 0 dc.
feat from Creighton university at Oin-
aha.

The history of last week’s game is
unusual. The Golden Avalanche start-
ed out to win early. During the half
it gathered seven first downs while
its opponents were making two. But
the downs were made at the wrong
time so the score remained o to 0.
Then came the second half. Creighton's
fourteen first downs brought in four-
teen points and Marquett‘s two failed
to alter its score,

The Pioneers are working hard this
Week. The power developed against
Drake during the last three minutes
of the Drake game, has been amplified
in practice. The varsity ripped off
the longest and most consistent runs
of the season against the freshmen
yesterday.

Pioncers Have No Injuries.

Barring eleventh hour injuries, Grin—
nell entrains tomorrow without a hos»
pital list Captain Davis injured his
knee in the Homecoming game, but it
is healing fast. Fall’s had ankle has
improved much the last three or four
days and Klinefelter's ankle should
be healed by then.

Two additions to the sound should
help the local chances. Kiescl has
mastered his scholastic difficulties
and may do some work at guard Satur—
day. Jack Locke just climbed over
some scholastic barriers and may be
seen in action in his favorite position,
fullback.

Douglass Praises
Ohio Conference

Psychologist Says
of Meeting On Feelings Add
Emotions Last Week.

Great Thing,

"It was the greatest thing of its kind
that has occurred in Ameritu for
years,” stated Prof. L. C. Douglas who
has just returned from a. Conference on
feelings and emotions which was held
at \Vittemberg college in Springfield,
Ohio last Week.

When asked what particular func~
Lion if. had, he replied, "The confer-
ence provided an opportunity for the
various schools of thought on emotion.
to compare and clarify their concep-
tions of the subject. It gave them a
chance to straighten things out.”

Professor Eueler, of Hamburg, Ger—
many, child psychologist; Carl
Schneider of the University of Berlin:
Pierre Janet, French psychoApathologr
ist; and Edouard Clapsre'de, Swiss
child psychologist Were the most em-
inent foreign representatives at the
conference. The best American papers
were read by Prof. William MacDougal
of Duke university. formerly professor
of psychology at Harvard; Professor
Wise of the University of Ohio, who
read a. paper on behaviorlstic psychol-
ogy; and Prof. Walter E. Cannon of
the Harvard Medical school, who is u
pbysioligist, Douglass said.

“The conference will help to clear
up the differences between the Intro-
spectionists and the Behaviorlsts. It
provided a. common meeting place and
Will certainly influence future devel»
opments in psychology. -ln fact it is a
landmark in American psychology
leading to much new experimentation
in the study of emotions. Emotions
was chosen as the subject of the Col:-
ference because the best work has
been done in that particular field and
it is a field which offers the greatest
promise and the must fruitful dls-
coveries," concluded Mr. Douglass.

New World Symphony, From Which
Knight Will Play Largo In Chapel,
Was Composed In Little Iowa Town

In the little Iowa town of Solllville,
Dvorak‘s New World Symphony, from
which Dr. Knight will play Largo in
Chapel this week, is believed to have
been completed and revlsedl

The New World Symphony was
prompted by Dvorak’s appreciation of
the Amel'lcau negro folk-songs. Three
of the principle themes of the sym—
Dhauy are founded on folk tunes, and
the first part of the Largo is written
in the pentatonic or live-note scale,
which the negroes used.

Antonin Dvorak was at soiliviiio. in
northeastern Iowa, during the summer
months of 1m, There, it is claimed.
he composed Humoresuuo and his F
Major string Quartet, as well as com-
plctlng the New World Symphony and
revising the Largo which Dr. Knight
will play this week.

 

Dvorak loved the little town, and

spent many hours by the Turkey river,
listening to the bird songs and the
sound of the water. fcwa beauty so
inspired him that within four days of
his arrival, the story goes, he had
completely sketched the P Major
String Quartet.

In the afternoons, Dvorak liked to
listen to the old settlers of the Turkey
river country, as they told stories a!
the adventures and hardships of the
frontier days. He himself was always
a plain man at heart. The son of u
very poor Bohemian butcher, he was
really happy only when among the
peasants of his homeland.

Splilvﬂle people used to tell a story
of how Dvorak's daughter fell in love
with one of the neighborhood boys and
planned to slope. The two were
caught, and the next day. the story
goes, the Dvorak family returned to

 

New York, leaving Iowa forever.

Main Addresses
Women’s Confab

Assert: Women Will Continue to
Exercise Chief Inﬂuence
In the Home.

Journcying to Clnrcmnut, California,
ten days ago to attend a conference on
the education of Women. Prcs. l. H. T.
Main took part in the installation of
Ernest James Jacqua, '07, former dean
of men and assistant to the President
here at Grinnell. as President of the
new Scripps college for women just
opened.

Scripps college for women, along
with the forty year old co-educational
college, Pomona, composes the Clare~
munt colleges of which President
Blaisdell, former president of Pomona,
is the head. Mr. Main intimated that
it was the probable purpose of the
Claremont colleges, in the near fut-
ure, to establish a college for men, the
nature of which is unknown. It was
also stated that President hlaisdell's
status in the Clarcmnnt colleges was
analogous to that of the chancellor in
the state universities.

' ‘Iiist Look To Colleges.

In addressing the conference, which
was composed of the leading deans and
professors of the western and south-
ern universities, in his paper “Re-
marks on the Education for Women,"
President Main stated, "We are to
look to our colleges rather than to
universities with their overgrown pop-
ulation, tending to mass production,
and especially we are to look to col.
leges where women students are given
the opportunity and the incentive‘to
stress life, rather than the things of
life."

Mr. Main pointed out in his speech
that to women rather than to men is
the World to look for emphasis on
wisdom, truth, and beauty as life
qualities. Likewise he affirmed his
conviction that co-educatiun was of
the first rate impormncc'in the educaA
tion of/ women. .

When specifically discussing the
sphere of Women in the future, he con-
tinued, "In spite of the franchise re»
cently given to them, in spite of the
new avenues of service open to
them out in the world, women will
continue to exercise their chief in
fluence in the home, and from the
home as a creative center.

“It is my conviction that at new
spiritual renaissance is beginning to
gather momentum."

Scrlpps Women Fay $1000.

When speaking of the new Scrlpps
college, President Main told the re-
porter that fifty students Were care-
fully selected for their personal and
scholastic record and that fifty stu—
dents will continue to be taken in un-
til eventually the college will have
four classes of fifty women each. A
dormitory, it was stated, will be built
each year for four years to bake care
of the new Students.‘ The fifty women
women entering us freshmen, Mr.
Main stated, are charged $1901) a. year,
this amount covering tuition, board
and room. Great gntlinslsm for the
Claremoht experiment was expressed
by Mr. Main.

GRINNELL GAINS 0N PASSES

Pioneers’ Lone Score Comes Late
In Fourth Quarter 0n Pass,
Evalln to Macy.

Drake was victorious over Grinnell
in Saturday's grudge battle and there-
by got revenge for the defeat handcll
the huuldogs last year. The score
was 25 to is but the game was more of
a struggle than the score indicates.

The game was played under condi-
tions more fit for baseball than foot.
hall, and the heat began to tell before
the game had progressed very far.

Most of Grinnell's gains came in the
second half on passes, while Drake's
yardage was piled up mainly by the
cutbacks of Cucllayne and the return
of punts by Meyers. Both teams were
offside many times during the game
and most of the penalties inflicted on
both teams resulted from this source,
Both teams, though showing a marked
lack of experience, showed a great im-
provement over their former games.

Drillie Scores'Eiu‘ly.

Drake's first touchdown came early
in the first quarter on Cook's 17 yard
dash off tackle and Drake's only for-
ward pass of the game, Barnes to 2m:
cek, which was good for about 14
yards, Jack Barnes also contributed
a few short gains in Drake's initial
march to the goal line and it was he
who scored the first touchdown.

After this offensive Grinnell's de-
fense stiffened until the closing lno-
ments of the first half when Cockayne
went from Drake’s 43 yard line across
Gl‘lnnell's goal line in three plays.

Drake’s third touchdown came in the
second quarter after Meyers' punt had
been downed on Crinncil-s 1 yard line. -
Eva'hn puntetl to midfield but Meyers
returned 28 yards. A few line bucks
brought the ball to Grlnnell's 5 yard
line Where Grinnell held for two
downs, but on the third, Barnes
plunged over the goal line. 1

Meyers Runs 59 raids.
Drake's fourth and last touchdown
came an Meyers’ beautiful 59 yard run
around the Grinnell left end behind
perfect interference.

Grinnell’s touchdown came on a spi.
rited aerial attack late in the fourth
quarter. This offensive started on
Grinnell's own 35 yard line where
they received a punt. On the fourth
down, Evahn passed to McIntire for a.
gain of.25 yards. Macy then passed
to Kingury for another gain of 3 yards.
putting the hall on Drake's 5! yard line.
On the next play, Drake was penalized
5 yards for Offside, putting the ball on
their 4 yard line. Drake stiffened and
three line plunges netted only 2 yards.
but on the last down, Macy received
a pass from Evaliu across the goal line.
