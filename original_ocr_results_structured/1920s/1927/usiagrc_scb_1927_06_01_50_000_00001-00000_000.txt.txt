Perhaps Grinliell‘s greatest hope for
a successful season is in “Fuzz" Watt,
the incoming football coach, His ini‘

indicates real ability, He served as
head coach at Argentine l-ngll, Kansas
City, for seven years producing teams
which were usually of State champion-
ship calibl-e. Many of his athletes
have become college stars alter they
led his tutelage. The last year he
has been at Roosevelt high, Des
Moines. where he produced an unde-
feated football team, a basketball team
which lost only one game, and a track
team which made all creellent show-
mg against roug competition.

Watt faces much the same task
which he faced as a sophomore in
Grinnell in 1016. That year there

At the Colonial.

The Expel'iilielltdl theatre is
plcselltiug an extremely varied hill
to the commencement audience at
tlic Colonial theatre, Saturday, under
the direction of 11-, \l‘illiani Angus.

The first play, “Danger," by Richr
aid Hughes, is based on an incident
ill a Welsh lllillc. Till-cc persons are
trapped by a ccli'evirl and face the
double danger of suifocatlon and
drowning from water rising from
some underground source, Help is
coming, but it is doubtful whether it
will al-l-ile in lime. Tile three thus
face a startling situation, and the play
moves swiftly to a dramatic conclus-
ioll. One feature or the play is.that
it will be presented entirely in the
dark. a "listcuiug" play, it was
\ll‘lttcn o 'glually‘fol- the radio.

.llelhllrlllua ll Tlll‘llll‘r

“Heads and Hearts of Oak" ol-
“Love Will Find a Way," by Louise
Ayres Garden, is a melodramatic
thriller. It presents to the breathless
audience a heroine who goes five miles
in a blinding snowstorm ill half an
hour to warn the hero, a youth pos-
sessing every manly virtue. Three
men are madly ill love with her; one,
the Gui-ate. already has a wife and six
childrenithere‘lore he resolves the
Sim will never know! The devotion
and selfsaci-ifice of the mother save
the hero from the liiurdeous plot of
the villain.

The last play, “The Valiant." by
Hoiwurthy Hall and Robert Middle-
mas, was prepared for the national
contest at Northwestern. and is being
presented again for the commence
ment audience to see the duality of
work that would have represented
Grinnell nationally.
