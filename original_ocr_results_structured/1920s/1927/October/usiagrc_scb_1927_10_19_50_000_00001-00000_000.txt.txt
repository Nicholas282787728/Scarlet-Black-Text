‘Grrinnell Sqlmd Unable to With-

Combuskers.

PIONEERS ARE OUTW‘EIGHED

Threaten to Score Only Once In
First Quarter When Pass
Nets 35 Yards.

When a steamrroller meets a mole-
hill, the result is obvious. A similar
reaction occurred at the Linculn Me-
morial stadium last Saturday, when
the Pioneers suffered a 58-0 drubbing
at the hands of Nebraska.

If ever a. team fought (tn uphill hat-
tie, it was the diminutive Grihnell
squad. wtth men averaging 20
pounds heavier than they. the Fio-
neers were compelled to withstand
.an attack or eleven of the biggest men
the Cornhusker state ever produced.
The continual arrival of fresh men
made it impossible for the Grinnell
line to accustom themselves to the
Nebraska attack.

McIutire stir, Runs.

There was one man in the Pioneer
, lineup, however, for whom none of the
-Cornhuskers seemed too bi That
man Was McIntire, the diminutive
Pioneer signal- aller, whose defensive
playing at the surety position was
nothing short of spectacular. Time
after time, Presnell and Howell broke
through the entire Grinnell defense,
only to be floored by the Pioneer
quarterback, when it seemed as

though nothing could stop them.

Only once did Grinnell threaten, and
that was early in the first quarter
when a shoestring pass, Evan to
Mclntire, netted about 35 yards. An
end run and another pass advanced
the ball well into the Cornhusker ter—
ritory, only to have Ruse tumble on
an attempted run around left end.

Although the Pioneer team fought
with every ounce of smmina that they
possessed, they were up against too
much best and too much experlenoe
and consequently the nine touchdowns
which Nebraska collected were made
with but little euort. When the
whistle ended both the hall and the
game, the Combuskers were but a.
few yards from additional touche
downs.

Presuell, Howell Sensations.

Judging by the performances of
Freeman and Howell, it would seem
as though one would not have to look
far to find half-backs for an All-Mis-
souri Valley team. The Open field
running of Presnell was sensational.
His sideste'pping and body twisting
were dazzling, and he sifted through
the Grinnell defense with case. Pres»
nell scored four of the Nebraska
counters. Howell was responsible
for three of the remaining five.

The Grinnell squad was more or
less battered as the game drew near
the end, but fought desperately until
the final whistle.

Mayor To Prevent Flivver Suicides
When Drake Students Race Saturday

"we can't prevent Drake students
lrom committing sui do but we're gas
in: to try to keep thcin from murder-
iilg our guests," said W, C. Ray, may-
or of Grinuell, when he was apprised
of the proposed flivvcr nice from
Drake university to Grinnell next
Saturday for the homecoming game
between-Drake and Grinncll.

”Speed limits in the city of Grlu~
nell will be strictly enforced, just the
some as they are going to be in Des
Homes, and these young darerdevils
will have to do their racing in the
country. Most of the cars will prob-
ably have neither brakes nor reliable
steering gear," it was nffii-med, and
what they would do on the streets 01
Grinncll, crowded with homecoming
visitors, causes every sobci'rminded
citizen to grow pale with apprebeih
sion,"

The racing flivvcrs will be met at
the west city limits of Grinnell by
Chief of Police Alexander B. Manson
and a squadron of motorcycle cops,

Tanager Reviewer
Lauds Prof. Payne

Compliments Article On Lloyd
George And Also Reviews
In Current Issue.

By Gil-lice Adams.

The October issue of the Tanager
contains several commendable num—
bers. Especially so are the book re—
views and Professor Payne’s article.
The latter had really beenlmore pro-
perly advertised on the cover than
any other in the magazine. The
thoughts of the author are clearly,
concretely expressed. The two sides
of the question involved, can Lloyd
George come back? are defintely sta-
Led, without bias; the reader is at li-
berty to draw his own conclusions.

A close second iniexcellence is the
group of book reviews, it is a well-
chosen mixture—biography, poetry,
novel, anthology. The differing styles
of the individual critics give a many—
sided appearance to the group. It is
not confined to the narrow outlook of
one persons upon one subject. The
most obvious rault—evident in all the
reviewsvis a marked love of long,
sonorous words. But that is a. half-
privilege of the reviewer: it empha-
sizes the dignity of his craft.

Story Taste Depioruble.

The Tanager’s taste in short stories
is becoming deplorable. Mr. Sig-
mund's efiort is one of the elements
contributing to the accusation “high-
brow" which is directed against the
Tanager, surely a light-hearted, even
outrightly humorous story is as wor<
thy of enjoyable reading. However,
it is unkind to deplore the Tanager's
taste, but the American peasant is
slightly over-worked as it is.

Blayne McCurry’s “Those Naughty
Tabloids" is worthy of several second
glances. There is much rich meat
for mental banquets. Even though
the concluding statistics are dismay-
ing to the unstutistical mind.
are cdroitly introduced; they give the
interested reader a batter understand~
ing of the facts.

“Bachelor lillttuucr" lly Student.

Among the remaining contents of
this issue, "The Roman Complex,” by
Lawrence Martin ought to be carefully
read and considered by every one. The
comparison formed in the article is a
little too apt for the comfort of a ser-
ious, well-minded citizen, it has some
very good grounds [or being true;
whethm' it will continue to be true is
a question tor the luturc. Helen
Thmuas’ "Bachclor Buttoner" is
plainly a student contribution. The
sketch ends too abruptly; it seems in-
complete, But the character dose
criucd . odd enough to carry a core
tniu amount of interest into the des-
criptiop.

The editorial is of greater value to
the journalist than to the ordinary
reader. It will he read only when
there is nothing else to read, more as
a matter of duty. However, the duti-
iul reader is then likely to find it ab-
sorhing to the last word. Whereupon
duty will become pleasure.

Poetry slime As Usual.

As to the poetl‘yiit is neither bet-
ter nor worse than usual. some of
the student poetry at past issues has
been better. The first stanza of Miss
Cunningham: poem ls of finer con-

tbey '

hue at the Grinucli campus or to the
hoosegow, as circumstances seem to
dictate. The race is scheduled to
leave the Drake stadium about nine
o‘clock, after a briei chapel service
led by Rev. R, L. Finch of the Drekc
faculty, and it is expected that the
leaders in the race will reach Grin-
llell about the time that the Home
coming chapel, which begins at ten
o'clock, is dismissed; while some of
tho stragglers may have had such
bad luck as never to reach Grinnell
until after the game has begun, at
2:30.

iiayor Fred Hunter of Des llloines
will be the otticial starter, and it is
hoped that hluyor \v, G. Ray ivill as-

'1'0 Tillie Up Collection at Game: Name
Gelstoll New Drum-Major.

Mustering its toll strength of thirty-
seven pieces the Grinnell college hand,
directed by Orville Beeler, will play

school band is one of the best ln the

major at several contests.

In order to obtain funds for needed
music and other expenses the college
band has asked the department or
physical education for permission to
take up a collection in the stands be—
tween halves Saturday. This permise
slon was readly granted, according to
Mr. Beeler, and students and others
are expected to contribute liberally to
this organization which has to do

enterprises.

The band will also play at the pope

The Harvard Exchange lecturers
this year will be offered by Prof.

Frederick Merk, historian, on "The
