Now that the house partics are all memories ior was
and 1927, we would like to make u post-mortem plea that
the hours at the women’s quadrangle be extended in the
future on nights or their occurrence to at least twelve
o’clock. .

Grinnell’s house party schedule tor
men's halls and women's cottages includes but eight
nights during the year, four nights each semester, and
three parties come on the same evenings. Ii such a drastic
innovation were made upon the Grinnell campus it would
mean a total oi eight extra hours altogether Inr thirty-
six weeks oi the college year added to the time at the
students' most supreme social enjoyment. The average
man and woman who works and plans and thinks about
his or her house party loses more sleep than that over
it,—why shouldn't they recoup on 'lhe "added enjoy
mentl

Other schools allow much later hours on such nights.
Grinnell could still maintain her conservative standing
and moral virtue it she allowed twelve instead of eleven
o‘clock nights for house parties.

"EVEN You LAZY Thom-“4

The good old days lmrc gone ior-ever But the good
new (13's are here to stay. Nu more will seekers aitcr
knowledge be compelled to dig deep into dusty rolnmcs,
consurnc the one a. m. electricity, or sit up with pots ot
cortce and wet toucl sueating blood over exercises in
language and science.

ror today, owing Io an entirely new and brilliantly
illuminating proe ss, oven the la7v people can become
educated. In hict, t's what Barney dongle would term a
Spark Plug cinch. It you don't believe it just r-ccall
tbesc monotonously lamiliar pictures luridly displayed in
any magazine;

We can have that piano, now, Nell! There was tivc
more dollars in the pay envelope tonight, and I owe it
all to c. s, I." This from n seriousmlinded tor-ger-ahead
in business as he rushes up the steps to greet his wife.
0r, "He‘ the most interesting man I know" (image oi
one lady to another), “he acquired a cultural background
ol'ernighLE”; “How I learned French without a teacher7
in only 24 lessons"; “Learn the secret or 15 minutes a
dcyil‘ascilmte your friends": "Pnbllcrspeaking at sight";
"Learn to paint in six weeks."

Why spend iour years in college when by sitting at
home the mailman will bring you a liberal or specialized
education, exactly what you want, costing you very little
time and no ettnrt at all. "Clip the coupon below, till it
out, send it to us, and the world lies at your feet."

Synthetic education is but one instance at the modern
trend toward a. maximum oi realization with a minimum
oi expenditure. Everywhere a beckoning hand summons
us to the delights oi conquest without conquests accomr
panying hardships. ”Exemise this new easy wa 7
out etiort"; “Buy on installments, the cosy wa
our delicious breakthst load and enjoy periect health."
The number of people that iollow the beckoning hand is
not told, but the prosperity ot the concerns that beckon
is exceedingly great it the amount oi continued advertis—
ing is any indication. ,

In spite oi all this seeming evidence to the caull'ary,
we still persist in the oldridshioned notion that the most
tootbsome kernels come in the hardest shells. There is
a sneaking conviction that won't quite tade away that
perhaps the old iolks were right when they sztid, “We
only get out oi lite what we put into it."

The magazine racks of the college librru arc filled
with periodicals land pamphlets of Henry eve ' kind, many
of which are never npened. However, there is it scarcity
of business and professional magazines and juuruills
which could lake the place of these other more or less
unused publications.

The men t7[ the college who are going into business,
engineering, medicine, journalism and law would be in»
terested in reading magazines dealing with their'particu—
lar protessions and giving a broader and more practi-

cal outlook than can be gained in the college classroom.‘

The special rack for business and procession-d maga—
zines could be enlarged and made more setistactory than
it is at present by ii transference, if not an enlargement,
