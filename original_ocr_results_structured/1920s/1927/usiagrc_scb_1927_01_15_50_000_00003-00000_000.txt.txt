think when a man gets his money his .;
every want is satisﬁed." Mr. Williams
declared. "I learned this was not true
when i received my ﬁrst. promotion in
the steel plant. it was one which
brought a wage increase of only two
cents an hour. but the unconcealed ad-
miration and envy oi my oldgang‘h
brought home to me the real value or
the promotionva higher social stand-
ing which came with it."

it is impossible, Mr. Williams stated,
to separate the man irorn the job. “Evan
Pugh was the least important man in
town because he was the least import-
ant man in the mine,” he said, speaking
or one oi his experiences in Wales.
“But even old Evan, when a cavein
occurred, would diagnose the trouble
with all the mannerisms of a great phy-
sician, and when the job was com-
pleted, would complacently assure us-
thst he was indispenslhle if the mine
was to he kept running.

“There is no laboring man," Mr.
Williams continued, "who has not ex-
'plained to himself the importance oi;

himself only as he helieves in his job." e 9
The speaker told or a gang or foreign} 3

them to dig a hole, in two different
places, and then repeated the same
unintelligible order. Work was re-
sumed only when the ioremau had
taken time to explain the purpose be~‘
hind his orders. In a like spirit, the
secretary of the Hohos union called
Mr, Williams to task for coniusing ,
