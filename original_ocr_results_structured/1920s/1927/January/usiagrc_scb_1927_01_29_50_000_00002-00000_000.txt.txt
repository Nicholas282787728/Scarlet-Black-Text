Articles by tivo educators in recent magazines furnish
some advice which is north the attention or college stir
dents. ”.

In McNaught's Monthly, Hcii v Louis Smith, president
oi Washington and Lee university, presents four ques—
tions, primarily ior boys about to enter college but quite
applicable to university students. Atter stating that the
main diiference between prep school and college is in the
amount of freedom, President Smith tasks these tour ques~
’tiuns: d "

"Question 1. Are you man enough to get up promptly
every morning, get to your meals and to school on time
every day, and go to bed at a ﬁxed hour every night, all
on your own initiative without a word of reminder from
anybody? “

"Question 2. Are you man enough to go oif‘ by your»
self every day and study all your lessons till you know
them, without having any one tell you to get to wot-1:7

“Question 3. Are you man enough to carry loose
change in your packet without spending it?

"Question 4. Are you man enough when another fel-
law's answer is in easy reach, to tail on an examination
rather than obtain unlawful aid?

‘ “Until you can saiely be trusted with entire liberty
in matters involving your truthtulness and’bonor, stay
away. You are not yet prepared."

If those four questions were answered literally and
truthfully, very few of us would ever reach college.
Nevertheless, there is a real ideal there worthy of con
sideration, ‘

In The Dcarhoi‘n Independent it Writer. apparently
a faculty memberiof one of oilr educational institutions,

o
presents an article entitled “Tho Things I Should Do ii 1
“were in College Aglllll l' The author laments the various
opportunities of his college life which be neglected. The
snbstancc of his material is this

it he were to have the opportunity of again exporr
encins l's tnidcrgradnato life he would learn to concen—
trate, giving le time to studies with more concentrated
ittlciition; he would to -n to eaprcss his ideas on any
occasion. become proficient in some one line of endeavor,
participate in athletics, break the habit of procrastinat-
ing studios, get acquainted with instructors and spend
less time on the practical studies

He believes that training the mind is more iniportrl lieteers in two games over last wee]:

out than storing the memory with facts, that wisdom is
not measured by the number of boolis a person reads.

While the advice manifests a pedagogical tinting, it
presents all interesting view of an educator who under-r
stands and reali' s the opportunities which he neglected
in his college life.

Fortunately, the Tanager Guild had one worthy feature
fits name. It was certainly a bird of an organization
and it flew ttwrvy.

I'II’E DOWN.

in spite of occasional avowals of super-human and
divine powers possessed by individuals, most people are
prone to regard their fellow men as humans 7 even
reierees.

There are few poorer displays of sportsmanship than
when after both teams are playing claim and hard. the
referee declares a foul on it member of the home team, to
be hissed by the crowd. Missouri Valley referees are hired
by the conference athletic heads and are selected on their
ability. If the 'ei‘viccs of a referee are unsatisfactory, the
otticial loses his job.

So [N' this seasuii, no fouls have been called all the
G innell crowd but such occasions llztvc occurred in Dust
1V rtl's. Thus. the purpose of this comment is more 01‘ an
"ounce dl' prevention" suggestion. Unspol‘tsmltnsllip has
no place in Gi'innell athletics.

The bzlti feature is that the thallglltlcssncss of a few
individuals can bring invitliousuess upon the Whole Gr
ncll crowd The best practice is to convert the energy
\laslnrl in hissing into some extra yelling at the primer
time. / A. c.

)[UL‘KRAKISG Tim COLLEGE.

Apparently going on the supposition that The Plastic
Age represented college as it really is, Liberty is conduct-
ing a. campaign to investigate the variety of charges it
allegcs are being made against young men and women in
colleges, Fullnwlng are examples of questions contained
in a letter sent to various papers:

Have social affairs at tile college during the past two
years been wet 01' dry!

Is liqiwi' easy to me! an or near the campus?

Have you noticed It change in, £ch attitude 0/ the
students toward the social conventions?

What proportion of the girls of your acquaintance will

copage in petting parties?

Again the question of the morals of college students
will he rehashed in the public print . . , Such publicity
will contain no fundamental criticism of our colleges and
universities. Nothing will be said or standardization.
Neither will it get at the real problems of higher educa~
tion, such as those of admittance and over emphasis or
athletics, problems that undergraduates themselves are
trying to help solve. Likewise neither will it indicate
the inclination or many college students to treat with dis-
respect common "rali ra " tendencies, and instead, by
means or honor courses. etc, to place greater emphasis
on the fact that colleges primarily are institutions of
higher learning. — From The Bowdoin Orient (nowdoin
