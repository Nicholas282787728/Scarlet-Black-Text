EXPERIENCED pipe-smokers from Cape Lis-
burne to Cape Sable (get out your map of North
America!) recommend P. A. to you as the
ﬁnest tobacco that ever lined the bowl of a pipe.
You’ll check-in with their recommendation.

Why, the instant you swing back the hinged
lid on the tidy red tin, your olfactory nerve reg-
isters a fragrance like that of a pine-grove on a
damp morning. And when you tuck a load of
this wonderful tobacco into your pipe—say,
Mister! ‘

Cool as Cape Lisburne, mentioned above.
Sweet as the plauditsmf a ﬁrst-night audience.
Mild as morning in Cape Sable. (That’s work—
ing-in the old geography!) Mild, yet with a
full tobacco body that completely satisﬁes your
smoke-taste. Buy some Prince Albert today and
marEe the test!
