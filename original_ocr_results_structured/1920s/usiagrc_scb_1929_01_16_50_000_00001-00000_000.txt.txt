Clark Beats Dibble Quintets In
Both 'llheir Games.

The :lnnual' intramural basketball
season was inaugurated Saturday at-
ternoon in the men’s gymnasium
when two teams from each building
swung into action. The scores were
lair . close indicating that the teams
are evenly' matched. All the games
were marred somewhat by ragged
playing and lack of team work,

in the first game ot the atternoon.
Building Three's a team deieated
Smith Hall's A team by the score of
20 to 13. The game was very close
throughout and until the last few
minutes. the stable boys never had rt
lead or over two points. Mclntire,
who scored eight points. pl. ved best
tor Three while Butterlield was
Smith's best man with five counters,

The second game or the atternoon
resulted in victory tor Smith’s B
team over Three's 13 team by the
score or 10 to s. The game wa, char-
acterized by roughness, Cox. Tipton,
and Allison being sent from the floor
on account of personal fouls, Dunn
and Wiseman played good games tor
Smith while Kiesel was the star {or-
Three.

Buildings Four and Two split their
games, Four winning the A game and
losing the E game, The Forensic boys
put a good team on the iield in both
games, but their A team was their
strongest point. The A team won by
the score or 14 to 11 after trailing
most of the game. Woltc and Fergu~
son played the best game for Four
while Kent scintillated at all times
tor Langan, The E gamc was close
during the st half with Two miss-
ing many shots but in the second half
the Langsnites got the range and
won 15 to 10. ottcson and Clll‘islofr
tersoit starred for Two while Brod-
fortl and Sweeny were Follr's best
players.

The last two games resulted in the
making of history. Dibble hall which
has for years been the champion in
ha ctboll dropped both games to
Clark ball by the score of 11 to is in
the A game. and 13 to 8
in the B game. They tossed wild
heaves at the basket trom all dis~
taoces and angles ln air attempt to
score but at the end or the game all
they had collected was a goose egg.
Thomas of Five was the star of the
game and Bradley also played well,
The B game looked like Six was
about to annex a victory for about
thi-cc-nnarters or the game but Beck
of Clark started hitting the basket
to put Clerk in the lead 13 to a. Kautz
nnd'Beck were best for Clark while
Mark was the leader for Six.

In spite of recent disasters in the
way or basketball games, optimism
still prevails in the Pioneer camp as
the Gi-innell eager-s prepare to meet
Carleton here Thursday night, jirst
two days after mixing with Creighton,
Carleton, athletic leader in the Mid-
West conference, is going against the
Council quintet for the ﬁrst time in
10 years with honors to regain. in
the last iracas betweeu the two col-
lcgcs. ci-inncll came away with a 17
to is margin

Carleton this real' has lost games
to two Big Ten qurntets but has thus
far been undefeated in its own class,
Led by ,Simso and Setter-quiet, n pair
oi crack guards, who will becoirie in-
eligible at the end or the present
semester, and Leach, a center who
measures 73 inches, standing, lying
or playing basketball, the baskctcers
rrom Nortlrtield showed Wisconsin
univci ’ty a battle most or the way
only to lose, 32 to 24, while against
the University of Minnesota they
trailed 28 to 21 when the gun sotlmlr
ed, The two crack guards will be
pl ing their last game for Carleton
when they play here and will prob-
ably battle their best

Carleton is almost u sister school to
Griiiiiell in the matter of athletics,
being a small school with a big nth;
letic reputation. it would not he at
all ami - at this time to recall that
Coach 'liesdzlle played basketball
(or Carleton in his day and at that
time the college riglittully boasted a
national championshiu, as Such titles
go in basketball.

The game also takes an intercon-
ierencc aspect since, the schools oi
the Big Six having withdrawn, the
Missouri Valley conference is now
laced with showing supremacy to the
herd driving teams ot the Mid-West
group. Gi-innell has already shown
its’heels to one of the schools of this
conterence by downing Coo, 30 to 20,
but may he laced with a harder prob
leiri against Carleton, since the North-
iield school leads the loop with a trio
ot victories and no dcteats.
