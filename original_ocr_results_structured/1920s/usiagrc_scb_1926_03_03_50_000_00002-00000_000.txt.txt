dormitory reception is cold and harsh
as compared to the lraternity wel-
come. The accusations are true enough
to warrant attention.

Recent gl‘hduates who lived .in the
dormitories are not hesitant about go-
ing there to slay when in Grihhcll,

hut alumni who were there before the
time 0‘! the halls hdve no old homes

to which to return. When they do go
to the dormitories no one knows them,
they are ignored, and they think almit
mater is not what she used to be

The remedy is simple enough. Dor-
mitory men are not intentionally rude
and each house chairman might call
to the attention of his building that
the air of hospitality needs cultiva-
tion.‘ A committee on hosxiitztlity
might well be appointed in each build-
ing in order to make certain persons
responsible for every visitor's come
fort and entertainment.

It college authorities could direct
old grads and other guests to the
men’s balls with the assurance that
the ﬁrst man they met would be re
sponsihle tor taking care of Their
wants, it Would be evidence of an im-
proved spirit.

“Moving day is every day icr ‘the

Dr, Carly deplored the tendency oi

opinion, there is no greater call to

rural life, and the Americanization cl

the fact that “the bells of Cambridge
