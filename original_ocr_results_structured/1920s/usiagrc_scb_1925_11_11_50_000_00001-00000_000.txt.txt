Cyclones Score In Second Period But
Grinnell Soon Knots Cunnt in
the Third Quarter.

In a game that was played on a
snow covered. and Wind swept field,
the Ames Cyclones and the Grinnell
Pioneers battled la a tie score last
Saturday. The final outcome stood 9
to 9 after the two teams had fought
for an hour in a raging blizzard.

The large Ames homecomingcrowd
was materially decreased by the
weather conditions, but those who
did bundle up and shiver were re-
warded by a well played game, all
things being considered. Fumbles
were remarkably few and both teams
fought desperately but in vain, as the
high Wind kept the piety confined to
the south half of the field, and the
gumbo field pmhibited any spectacue
lal' open field running. Passing was
practically useless as the hands of
the receiver were numbed 13y the
cold.

Pass For Touchdown.

Ames did her scoring in the second
period, After tl'yilig to pierce the
Scarlet and Black line and finding no
encouragement there, C. Hill shot a
pass to J. Benin who crossed the line
for a touchdown. In this same quar-
ter Behm lifted the heavy ball over
the south goal putting- the score 970
for the Aggies. Thrughout the re-
mainder of the first half neither team
was able to make a serious attempt at
scoring. Grinnell defended the north
goal for the first period and was aid-
ed by the wind in keeping the ball in
Ames territory. Both lines were work-
ing nicely and no large gains were
registered by line plunging. Mecter
got off some beautiful runs around the
ends but the slippery ficld hindered
him from passing the Cyclone secon-
dary defense.

The second quarter found the wind
aiding the Aggies, with the Pioneers
on the defense thegrcater partcf tho
stanza. The wind played hhvnoswit-Ti}
Meeter‘s hunts and after a few Cxe
changes the Cyclones were in position
to score. Gl'innell's line proved ime
pregnable, so Amos resorted to their
old method of attack and Behm pulle
ed in a pass while traveling at full
speed and rambled twenty yards for a
score. Latter he scored a field goal
after a penalty had put the ball witne
in 6 yards of the Grinnell goal line.
The remainder of the half resolved it
self into the usual punting duel. with
the odds on Ames.

Dlu'is Crossed Goal

The second half opened with Crine
nell again defending the north goal.
Anne’s first punt was blocked by Mar-
tin and Davis recovered over the line
for a Scarlet and Black marker. This
was a pretty piece of work and took
the Cyclones off their feet. Meeter
made it 9 to 7 by a perfect goal kick.
The Pioneers carried the tight right
back at the Farmers’ again and were
soon pounding away within the 20 yd.
line. The Ames line held and Meet—
er‘s attempt at a field goal failed,
Ames was unable to advance theball
from their own 20 yd. line and three
plays found them back on the i yd.
marker. An optional safety threw the
score into a tie at s to s. Crinnell
kept the hall in Ames territory for
the rest of the third quarter, 'but was
unable to add to the score. Meeter atv
tempted a field goal trom the 25 yard
line, but was wide and failed.

Dropkicks Tail

The fourth quarter opened with the
ball in possession of the Pioneers on
Ames 19 yard line and the wind
against them, after futile attempts at
scoring via pass or run Mecter again
tried to register a field goal, but
was knocked down and the ball was
put in play by Allies, From then on
the Grinneil backs, led by Mccter,
launched an assult which kept the
ball on Ames gloullll, and had the
Cyclones not been aided by a strong
wind another would most
likely have been hung up by Gl'innell.
In this last drive for a score, lilcctcr
stood out as the most consistent man
on the field; time aftcr time he lug-

Next Saturday ’11 be known as
Dads Day in Grillllell. No formal

the aitemoon and the Cambridge dee

If the weatherman issues a few
dry days it is hoped that a good many
of the alumni and friends who were

with Drake will be here Saturday to
see the game with the Jayhawks.

In addition to the homecoming for
the parents, the Honor G Club will
hold a reunion. All of the old Honor
G men of the past have been invited to
return for a banquet and a 'business
meeting. The object of the reunion
is to obtain suggestions for improve-
ments of the club and to further its
purpose among the alumni.

The first meeting of the reunion will
be held immediately after the game
which will serve as a get together af-

The men working at the dormitory

number. There are seventeen in the
dining room; silver and glass, three;
china four; ass tant che washing
paus, one; mopping out kitchen, one;
paper chutes, one; hncn, one; mail,
one; and one pantry assistant.

Many students are employed by
Griunell business firms and it is es-
timated that there are fartyveightfill-

fci- many odd jobs to students in need
of work.

The variety of jobs continue on the
campus, however, and it is found that
four men are regularly employed at

the bell for all classes, one is secl-

The news that “rec hours” will no

The Serenaders have lost none, of.

To Be Given Friday.

Walter W. Bennett, who will spcak
on "Island Bird Life", Friday night,
will appear at the Congregational
Church instead of Herrick chapel, as
was previously announced.

As the Congregational Church is
well equipped to show the slides and
moving pictures with which Mr. Ben—'
nett will illustrate his lecture, it was
decided to have the lecture there. The
slides are made from actual phum~
graphs taken by Mr. Bennett, and the
colors of the ‘birds are exactly reproc
duced by difficult processes.

Mr. Bennett’s lecture will appeal to
everyone, as he presents an intensely
interesting subject in an equally intern
csting manner, Game birds and their
life will be discussed, and a plea for
the conservation of our rapidly diminr
ishing bird life will be made,

As one of thc foremost authorities
on bird life in the middle west, Mr.
Bennett has attained an enviable rep
utatiou among men of science. Prof,
A. 0, Thomas, treasurer of the Iowa
Academy of Science, wrote to Mr. Ben-

The debate will be notahlc froip an—

Grinnell students a chancc to come

with the American. As a rule, Am-
erican debates are inclined to be more
formal. the chief consideration being
the presentation of a dove-tailed, air-

make three interesting speeches up
on various aspects of the subject, and
they are more interested in having
an enjoyable evening than in merely
presenting argument, The tour of

SQUAD READY FOR KANSAS

» s i ll Come to hard Field
Saturday With Tenln N61. up to
standard set in Past

Apparently well satisfied with the
defensive work of the line in the
Ames game, coaches Hylanﬂ and
Black are devoting most of their
time this week strengthening the
scoring machine. The Pioneers made
nearly three times- the yardage of
the Iowa State eleven and twice the
number of ﬁrst downs but the score’
board failed to act accordingly.

-Tlle Pioneer squad is in good shape
for the Kansas encounter. Minor in-
juries incurred Saturday should be
healed by this week end and with the
exceptions of McLain and Rose, the
squad should take the field in good
turn.
Imusns Has Good Record;

This game marks the first gridiron
clash between the two schools. Kane
sas has made an enviable football
record in past years. Seventyesix
times the laybaivkers have vanquish-
ed Missouri Valley elevens as Compare
ed to fortyeight losses. In thirty—five
iears of football Kansas has won 156
and lost 75 games. Few schools can
boast such a record.

While the layhawkers have shown
flashes of strength in their games to
d. e. the team has not been function—
ing with the smoothness. and dash
nccess. _ for a winning combination.
Much new material is being develope
ed this year and only time will remedy
‘the lack of experience. Injuries have
also played an important part in the
poor shﬁuing of Kansas so far this
season. ,

Scrappy on Defense

The team is icportcd voiy weak
offensively but in the shadows of
their own goalposis the linemen are
real richtcrs. Twelve times the Kan-
sas line held the Nebraska Cornbnsk—
ers inside the‘Kansas 10—yard line;
three times they held the oklahoina
Sooucrs on the 1—yard line.

Although oklahoma and Kansas
played a scoreless tic last Saturday
tlciinsns outplayed the Sohners decis-
ivcly in the second half gaining for-
tyetwo yards to Oklahmnfi’s thirteen.
The occasion was the Oklahom
homecoming- and a cold wind com—
bined with a slippery field made the
play uncertain.

Center ul Ends strong

Davidson, center, and Powers and
H. Baker, ends, are reported as the
outstanding men of the squad. Dav»
idson has already received mention as
a possible alleconlerenéia selection
for the pivot position, Mullins, tackle
and captain, is another man who is
reputed to be a consistent performer.

One of the outstanding backs of
last year, Zuber, received an injury at
the start of,the season and he has
been out ever since, thus weakening
the lay-hawk attack.

Davis Stars

The Gl'innell line which has been
improving steadily is being counted
on heavily in the approaching con-
test. The work of the tackles, Davis
and Martin has been especially praise-
worthy iu the last few games. The
former although asophomore has
stepped into a varsity berth and is
performing offensive and defensive
pieces of line work that only veter~
aus are expected to do.
