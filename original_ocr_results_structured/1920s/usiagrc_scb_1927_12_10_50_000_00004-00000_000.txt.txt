Drake President Outlines Four
Methods of Approaching
Concept of God.

“The chief contribution or modern
science is an omnibotent and an iiifie
nite God," said President D. w. More»
house or Drake University in his talk
on “The Scientific Approach to Re-
ligion" given beiore the Y. W. c. A.
and Y. ll. C. A. in A. R. H. auditorium
Thursday evening.

“Build your concept or God on hu-
man experiences, through the inductive
method of science," he told the group
of college students. “We have gone irom
the vertical to the horizontal plane in
religious thinking. In iorincr times
religion was approached through the—
ology and history. Now we are look-
ing at it from the scienufie aspect. In
the older religion it didn't muttef how
few people worshipped; their whole
thinking and religious ceremony was
Godwnrd—vertical. Now. the social
aspect of religion is being emphasized
by the church and other organizations
such as the Y. M. c. A. and Y. W. C.
A. The first thing the preacher no-
tices when he enters the pulpit is the
number of people in attendance at the
service, for the human element is de-
cidedly important to religion ap—
proached from the scientific plane."

In explaining his own view Mr.
Morehouse said, “I’m for the horizons
ta! plane, and I would extend it fur-
ther,"

. MINES With Whitehead.

Mr. Morehuuse agrees With the state-
ment in Whitehead’s hook on "Religion
in the Making” that declares: "Today
there is but one religious dogma in de—
bate. What do you mean by God?"
Considering the present day attitude
of thinking he believes that “If we
can get into the minds of people a
conviction ol the existence 0! God We
have gone a long way in the solution
of this Emblem.

“Religion is an individual matter,"
he said. "How you see religion 527
pends on the wave length of light with
which you look. Carrying out the com—
parison between light and truth which
men have used for years, one finds
that if you study truth from one as-
pect you arrive at a different conclu»
sion from the man who analyzes it
drom another standpoint, just as the
astronomer tinds diiferent results
when he photographs a beam of light
through the red ray, or through the
helium or violet rays. No matter how
much you want to serve God and hu-
manity, your concept is unique and

 

hrohably
else‘s.”

tion or the four ways ol approaching a
concept oi the omnipotenV, according
to the outline or Nelson in “Neglected
Arguments for the Omnipotent.” iic
said, "The lirst method, by which pro-
bably is to do per ccut or the people
fix their beliel,istcnacity. rhcysirnp-
ly pick up some one belief and cling
to it, dragging it around with them as
the earth drags the other in rotation

“The second method if: authority Be-
cause youth is rciusing to accept a
concept worked out by people in any
the ’ty we hear 0[ The rmolt OE
yollth.‘ The trouble with this method
is that we don't distinguish properly
between people in authority and poor
Die of authority.

"The third method of approaching a
concept of God is by reason. But it
takes a lot of human experience to be
able to rely on reason. The granules
of truth in life‘s test tube, alone, \voll't
hring results. We must have faith (is
the catalytic agent. Throughout scir
ence and lite there are occasions when
one is forced to admit that, that which
cdnllot be, just is.”

Recommends Induction.

"The fourth method, the one which
I would recommend to you young peo.
pie, is the method of induction, the
scientific method. Some people say the
World has gone mild over the eientiiic
method. Day before yesterday i heard
the professor of Old Testament history
at Chicago university ay to a group of
men interested ill l'eli lous education:
‘The scientilic method doesn't have any
place in the religious field,’ This may
be true, but it religion is the all incillr
sive truth, no scientific law should
clash with it. We must accept the
findings of science as Well as of his»
tory and humanity.

”College students are tired ol having
knowledge intErpreted in the class
room. They tolerate the pedantic With
the same coldness he radiates. The
v. w. c. A. and Y. M. c. e. are or»
gitnizzltions through Which young peo-
ple can experiment and interpret re—
ligion inrterlns of life. We have heen
using the lecture method With reli-
gion: 'the method in which the profes~
SOY'S notes are transferred to the note-
buok of the student Without going
through the mind or either.’ But the
“Y" organizations are trying to make
religion it reality so that tho intel'veh»
ing medium is affected thereby. The
student wants to he and is a creative
force.”

Quotes Scientists.
Professor Morchouse quoted Henry,
Huxley, Voltaire, and Dnru'in to show
mat the men of science believe in the
existence of a supreme power. He adds
ed his opinion that “simply identifying

 

God with nature is inatcr-ialsiu, an air
surd policy practically recognized by
every one as such." ,

in concluding he id, "liuild your
concepts by your oh. ations, wcuvc
them into your experiences, and the
question or the brotherhood or man
and the fatherhood or God will hare
rcal moaning ror you. Science includes
the licids or inlinity and eternity and
gircs a concrete meaning to religion.
The chief contribution of modern scir
once is an ornnipctcut and an intinitc
Goa.”
