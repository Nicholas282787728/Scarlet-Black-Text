contest. We are sor to disappoint
our many feminine friends, out \VL

Sweet and VallGol'deu ore bsscol on
long cxpcricncc.

for in its place, something absolutely
new and unprecedented in college
circles. Acting on Frank Dewey’s
suggestion, we ‘are opening a contest
lor mcn of beauty and brains. The
Doric stuff is automatically excluded.
thus giving the rest of the boys .1
chance.

The Prizes? on, boys, you just
court imagine! We’ll drop a hint just
to satisfy your curiosity. In case any
of the Dibble Hall "mollycoddlds"
wins, there is o hand-[minted enl~
