To some minds the words “efficiency" and “liberal
arts college" may seem a hit anomalous or inconsistent.
We often think of Grinnell as a college. a sort of a
monastery lacking somewhat in piety, and dedicated to
the purpose of providlng for its members a comfortable
four years of leisure and study, apart from the bum.
drum of’a highsﬂying civilization. Four years of leis-
ure—but how reconcile that thought with our numer-
ous pronouncements on etiiciencyl To be efficient must
we not be acting or working according to a plan, and
without loss of time or energy?

This may he a bit confusing‘in fact, it may be
more confusing after our efforts in behalf of trlith and
clarity. And yet, it is possible to conceive of such a
thing as the efficient use of purposeful leisure.

For instance, useful conversation can scarcely be
classified as waste. if a tallr with your room mate, how-
ever rambling, discloses something of your personals
ity. or hi or unwittingly develops a hidden interest
in a subject. or trains you in the art of the most infor-
mal and utilitarian form of speaking, that mlk or cons

Letthe spirit of the present grow. it isn’t unrea-

Pioneers. They may be “eleven gentlemen from Grins

Grinnell needs and must have the success urge that

Thirty Years Ago.

A novelty was introduced in connec-
tion with the annual General recep-
tion given on last Saturday evening,
when the men who were old students
accompanied the new girls and helped
them to become acquainted. while the
men who are new were the special
charge of the girls who are sopho-
mores, juniors and seniors.

A strong movement is under way to
obtain funds to build a new men's
gymnasium.

Last Saturdﬁy 2L contract was closed
with Drake for a football game. This
was an unexpected step, since it has
always been contrary to Grinnell's
policy to play more than one game
each year with teams thought to be
in our class.
