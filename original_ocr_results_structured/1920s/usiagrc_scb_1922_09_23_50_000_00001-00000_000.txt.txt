The organization of the girls of the

socities, and the opportunity of erel)
girl in school, regardless of class
standing oi‘ socroty membership, to
attend the society parties on Friday
afternoons, are among several sweep—
ing changes made in the girls societyi
rules last Week. The new plan
is the wor oi an inter-society
committee which has been work-l
ing for some time on the br-ob—i
lem and was finally approved‘
by the tour societies, Calocasetbia.
Aegis, Philadelobica and Ellis, last.
Thursday.

The ruling comes as H. result of the
general campus feeling that therei‘
should be more albcollege tuner.
tions tor the girls in which cacb'
girl can tahe part. The 0 er girls
then will also be sponsors and help
each new girl in developing as much
as she can. The general feeling for
some time has been that the old SYSA

socities feel that the new ruling will
go iar toward solving several serious
problems.

ing planned liy the committe and
every organization will be given an
opportunity to put one on. In this
way every girl in school will be do~
ing something toward mailing the
girls’ college life more unified as Well

aptitudes. Plans are under wily for the

“Since All That Life Holds Is
Ours We Have No Right to
Be Pygmies.”'

“To me," said Dr. Steiner in his
address at the v. M. c. A. Thursday
night, “the ever recurring wonder is
that I am in life and a part of it—that
all that is in tbe‘universe I'm a part
at." We are not responsible for, nor
can we help our being here in life,
but since we arehere, and all the dis—
coveries, longings, hopes, and inspire-
tions of the ages are ours, none or: us
has a right to he a pygmy.

“We are not only ﬂesh, mind, and
passion," said Dr. Steiner, “but We are
also spirit. We are not only related
to father, mother, and the whole hu—
man race, but also to God." We need
the Will power to overcome our nat-
ural limitations of body, mind. and
spirit, and to become the giants Got]
wants and the world needs today. We
must control rivers, else they became
conflagratlons; so We must Control
ourselves, through or consciences, and
overcome our temptations and Limita-

COMPETITION FOR PLACES
IN BACKFIELD PREDICTED

Come-Back of the “01d Confr-
dence” Is Apparent, Both
Players and Students.

The Pioneers got their ﬁrst real
taste or bottle Wednesday alter-noon
when they were put through then-
ﬁrst scrimmage of the season. The
result or this sham battle was highly
satisiector-y to the coaches,
because oi the spirit with which
,evcr-y man cuter-ed into it and also
{because several men showed up
[favorably in the course of the scrim-
‘niztge who had not been especially
[considered holorc. Among these lat—
lter were Il'inlcr, home and Ker-stern,
all of whom showed up as strong
prospective varsity material.

. The general concensns or opinion
among both players and coaches
‘seems to he that the team is round—
,ing into condition much more rapidly
than had been anticipated. Both
players and coaches are becoming
accustomed to each other with a
prornptness whicb' bodcs well tor the
season's future prospects.

Charging and blocking will be
the main points stressed during the
coming week. A set of plays tor the
Parsons game will also be part of the
schedule during the next tew days.
‘Praictise on place kicks will be es
pecially stressed, because oi the new
ruling on the try lor point after a
touchdown has been made. The in-
dications are that few teams will try
to put the hall across the line on an
actual play because of the pilevup
which would be sure to tollow. Such
a procedure would lordinarily entail
too rnnch of a danger oi ininry to
valuable players to be used except in
‘the greatest extremity.

It is still too soon to begin per—
