 

Monday Traditionally Day of Stern
Justice at Grinnell For All Coeds

lll' )l-trgurt‘t Wei. .

Blue Monday has always been a day
of stern justice as well as calamity in
Grinllell, Just as today the el ug cur
ed finds herself called before a tribun-
al of justice on Monday night, so in
1860 the "inmate student" was brought
to account on the second day of the
week. But those pro—league
board days before that now passe me-
elianism, the conscience, had gone out
of use. No deadlv .it-tatting buzzer
called the pioneer coed helore seven
administrators of the law. Ullsilul-
inoned she went to the “Lady Princi—
pal" on Monday morning and reported
any misdemeanor that she had com-
iuittcd during the week. At least, this
was the theory of the thing.

Took “Littlit‘s’ Collrsr."

Unlike today's coed, the 1860 stur
dent enrolled in the Ladies' Course
ncver climbed into her bed at 12:40
a, in. after a date and two hours of
cramming. Under the sup sicn of
the “Female Principal" she euterr
tained her gentleman acquaintance lice
tween the decorous hours of four and
five on Friday afternoons, religiously
reserving her evenings for the pursuit
of a Certificate of Proficiency or a die
plonia from the Ladies’ Course. "ileu—
tal discipline and a preparation to
teach in the best Female Seininaries
in the country" were the aims or the
course the catalog informs us, but we
suspect that the little crosses marked
after the names of those who were de—
iinquent in Latin had something to do
with her ambition

Requirements Difficult.

The "prep” who sought admission 215
a freshmen to Iowa college in those
pioneer days had to have a knowledge
that today would be considered llhelmr
menal enough to warrant packing him
of: to a museum After he had proved
himself to be ot good moral character

wrrc

he must "sustain a satisfactory examr =

ination in English grammar, geogra-
phy, arithmetic, algebra, Latin gramr
niar, Caesar's Commentaries, Sallust,
Virgil, Greek grammar, the four ges-
p‘els in Greek, and Xenophone's Anar
basis." If he survived this he continued
to sharpen his wits with such formida-
hlc weapons as Day's Algebra Fidshed.
Xeunpllone’s Cyropaedia, and Aher—
ccmbe's Ditfcrenttal and integral Cal-
eulus. Threc silver Medals (\itnllciisd
in the catalog) which were presented
for distinguished scholarships at the
end-of each term served as an incent-
ive. Original essays and declarations
that had to he delivered regularly ev—
ery three weeks kept would-he time
wasters at work.

No men’s court or senate corralled
the 1860 collegiate, but a list of rules
were handed to him at his matricula;
tion with an additional list of gentle
reminders as the followin 4 ‘Neatnoss
in rooms is urged; students should
not leave wood, ashes. or rubbish in
the halls nor should they throw any-

thin}! down the register or out of the
window,” and “no student will move a
store lroni one room to another "

sterner rules are found in articles
In and v which read: "Prolanity,
obscen ~, lewtlness. pl 'ig at cards
or billiards, and the use or intoxicating
drinks as a beverage shall not be tolr
cratcd." and “Every student shall be
required to attend regularly on the
Sabbath some place or \\'m' hip desigr
hated ,- his family, or, in case of the
family railing to do so, by the l'ilcuir
ti'."

“’orliiuhv “'in lliil'tl.

Before the reniunerative possibilities
of hash slinging were discovered on
th Gunnell campus, wo ing one's way
through college was a grave problem,
Tuition in lssu was twenls'rfollr doi-
lnl, a term and board with “a good
family in town” amounted to a dollar
and a half a week, But these were
pl'edvflr prices, By 1363 the H. C. L
was being felt keenly and college
rooms raised to two dollars with an
additional charge of fifty cents for
store, table, chair and bedstead. “But

, strict economy.” the college eata-
log apologetlcallr adds, "students who
enjoy good health may go through coir
legs without assistance and without
incurring a tleht,”

What was known as the "Long Win-
ter Vacation" is featured in bold type
in all the early bulletins. “The great
majority of western students must lie
pend on their own efforts for an edu—
cation,” the publications observe,” and
as nothing is more appropriate for
them than teaching, a long winter var
cation has been determined to enable
them to teach without interfering with
their regular studies." This was the
pioneer substitute for hash slinging.

W-

lllissouri beat Nebraska last week in
a great battle 'I to 6. The \Vriterup in
the Omaha WORLD HERALD acelaims
the victory as one of big brains and
less brawn over less brains and bie'
brawn. We hope that the same holds
true next Saturday.

Midwestern football seems to be
more than holding its own against
teams from the East and West. Pur-
due beat Harvard 1p to 0 while Nortllr
western defeated Utah 13 to 6.

The game between Missouri and
Washington at st, Louis today
should be a good one. Aside from the
interest because of the effect on the
Valley standing the contest brings a
member of “the little four of the val-
ley" into conflict with one of “the his
six." May Washington win.

dinieult seems to have scrrcd its put»
Dose so far this season. The scores

mer years. were made.

Speaking or banners, it is probably
news to most of the readers or this
article, but the Missouri valley con-
fereneo does not recognize a football
champion, As far as we know the
only reason for this lies in the fact
that the conference is too large to per-
mit an equalization of schedules.
Sports writers and utlle‘r irresponsible
persons are to blame for all picking
at \alley football champions, and in
the case which came up last year,
crabhine from more than a tow seemed
fairly just.

Ed Cacln-nuc, sports editor of the
Kansas C y JOURNAL-POST will rel-
rrce three of the Grilluell games in the
\‘(tliiel‘nuce Illi car. The Grillllell-
Vebrasko, Grinue -Drakc. and the
Grinuell-Washington games will all he
llulltllctl by the popular Kansas City
man.

New conference or not, Grinnell will
have practically the same conference
games next year that she will’ have
this year with the possible exception
oi Nebraska, which has but a one-
game contract with the Pioneer offic-
ials. Who knows? We may be Val-
ley champions ”outside of the center-
ence", but still in the Valley.
