ings apparent in the administration
or aiialrs on the campus. The right
to criticise. indeed, is held by the mo-
jorlty of students to be as inalienable
and inviolate as any privilege ever
1iought ior by our Revolutionary fore
fathers. ort times criticism is merit—
cd but it also frequently happens that
there is 9.11 undercurrent of pessim<
ism; a. lack o! willingness to cooper-
ate with the authorities in an effort to
iremedy some or the evils so quickly
recognized and acclaimed; a reluc-
tance to exert sufficient effort to
jchange the course or events to their
‘most desirable course. In such an in—
‘stance, the

Knocking is o national pastime. It
‘15 as great a sport as any athletic con-
, tcst and is usually far more universal
,in its appeal. As in other things,
there are various types but these may

be generally classiﬁed under the two
heads oi destructive and constructive.

criticism degenerates

!

The former type, which often wins
the misnomer or the latter, usually
has little of open-mindedness in it
‘and a great deal of the purely selﬁsh.
It may ﬁnd its origin or “inspiration"
in some iaulty condition hot as a rule
the knocker is talking from the per—
sonal viewpoint alone, not from the
standpolnt or the group, and is a li—
cbiiity to the school.

an the other hand. constructive
criticism is highly desirable and is en-
couraged in all possible ways. It is
based oil 2!. real problem and usuallly
otters a tentative solution, At least
it is not unroir but strives to present
matters in a. manner that does not
antagonize thru exaggeration and mis—
statements hut thitt does open up the
question for thoughtful consideration.
It is this type or criticism that really
accomplishes

In Grlhnell, as in other colleges and
universities, there is a. full measure of
both types of criticism which touches
practically every phase oi our campus
life. It sometimes seems, indeed, that
the measure of knocking overﬂows and
that the majority of students are will-

What Do You Think

Editor oi Scarlet and Block:

We are just wondering if it would
n'i. be only fair to those students who
are not intcrcstcd in dancing, to pro-
vide some other form at entertainment
(or them during the ”rec" hours. We
should think that some kind or a DIOr
gram could he carried out at some dif-
ferent location during the same hour.
Were the writer the only one in the
class above mentioned, nothing would
he said, but there are a great many
students in the same boat who icel
that they need recreation and are enr
titled to it as much as the rest. The
writer has licavd more than one slur
dont say, "Oh. I don’t go to the 'ree‘
hours. All they do there is dance."
Why can't these people have a chance
at some other form or entertainment?
We would like to get some ideas on
this from other students.

A Junior.

Editor or the Scarlet and Bloch:

Articles have appeared irom time to
time in this column, relative to the
present system oi P. T. The students
realize that the department has a case
on their side or the question. Also
the students realize that the eiiccts or
P. T. are beneﬁcial and are not dis»
pal-aging in any way, those effec$.At
the same time, however. the student
maintains that he has a case which is
equally good. The point where the
student breaks with the department is
that l>. T. has all the requirements of
any other course without any ol' the
benefits. In other words the student
must comply with the same rules and
regulations in p. T. as ho docs in his
history or eronomic courses, without
receivmg credit towards graduation,

What are these rules and regula-
tions? In the ﬁrst place cuts count
toward the iatal eighteen. In the see
and place two outs give the student a
condition. To the writer’s knowledge
this rule is not used in any other deg
partment. In the third place the con-
dition o: P. ’I‘. has the some ciiccts as
a history or cconomic condition. In
the iourth place there comes the an-
nounceinont that ﬁnal examinations
will be held. These in the main, are
the rules oi the department.

Now the student maintains that
there is no essential diiierencc be
tween these requirements than those
in any other department. The case
or the student arises at this point, In

’III
I

 

 

any other course the student would
get credit towards graduation. It
scems unfair that a person 'should be
iorced to comply with two sets of
rules almost indentical, and in the
one case receive two hours credit and
in the second only the exercise, It is
as if, a person should work hard on
day and not get any wages. It is ior
this primary reason that the student
objects to the present system or P. T.
In conclusion, the students do not
belittle the beneﬁcient results or F.
‘1‘. Moreover the students realizc that
the department has a cascnn the
side. But the students maintain that
since the requirements they must ful-
ﬁll in F. T, are the some as they must

iuiﬁil in any other course credit to- l

wards graduation should be given
These who are taking the course
would appreciate same statement on
tile matter,f0r they feel it would
clear up the present iii feeling that
exists toward the department.
