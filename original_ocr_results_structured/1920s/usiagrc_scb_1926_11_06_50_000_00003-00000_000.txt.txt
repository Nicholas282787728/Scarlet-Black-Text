, The stag at eve

THIS fellow missed out on a heavy date tonight
by the close margin of one phone-cell. But
don’t waste pity on him. He has his jimmy-
pipe and a tidyqed tin of Prince Albert . . .
grand little pals in time of stress.

When that cool, comforting smoke comes
curling up the pipe~stem, troubles evanesce with
every puff. For P. A. is The [National Joy
Smoke in fact as well as phrase. Cool as a
money-lender. Sweet as a check from home.
Fragrant as a pine-grove on a damp morning.

You’ll like Prince Albert better than any
other tohacco you ever packed into a pipe.
You’ll like the friendly way it treats your tongue
and throat. You’ll like the way it helps you over
the rough spots. Buyer tidy red tin today and see!

tobacco is like it!
