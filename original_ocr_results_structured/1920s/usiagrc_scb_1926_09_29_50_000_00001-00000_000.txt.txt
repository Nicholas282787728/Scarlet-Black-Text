(By Myron hurt)

The Pioneers 'upencd their season
last Saturday with a 204) victory over
the scrappy Penn eleven. The day
was ideal for/football and although no
special train was chartered Crinucll
rootars made themselves knrwn in the
Penn stadium, At all timrs through
out the game, players as well as spcc-
tators seemed to be confhent that
‘Grilmell would have thc loig end of
the score, This attitude slov‘cd up the
same at stages and made tin Crinncll
defense seem rather weak, zspeciltlly
the offensive. Mcctcr camc‘up to ex~
pectotions as a man who ‘gan drive

Many Subs.

substitutions were made freely at
the beginning of the second half. Play
was rugged in the third quarter with
Penn having a slight advantage. At
times Penn made substantial gains
through the line and by the aerial
route, and again their backs were
stopped before reaching the line of
scrimmage. Penn threatened to score
for the first time and once, due ‘lo
a blocked punt, the ball was on Grin—
ncli's 1 yard line in Grinllell's pos-
sesston By a but and a penalty it
was talrcn to the center of the field
and Penn never threatened again. At
the beginning of the fourth qnltrter
the line-up that started the game was
used and with Grinnell playing a safe,
defensive game practically all the
time, the game ended as Nihlo re-
ceived Stotts‘ 20 yard pass on the

Library to College

A private library of more than 500
volumes is the gift of Miss Carolina
Sheldon professor emeritus of m—
mancc languages. :17 the college li-
brary. The collection consists large-
ly of French, Spiulisll and Italian
texts, many of which Miss Sheldon
purchased abroad, and which are val-
uable for their marginal comments.

In addition to those texts there are
a number of books on art and urchi
tecture, particularly that of the mcdi
acvai cathedral. A marked New Tas—
tamcnt with personally collected and
inserted plates, and a scrap book of
ori 'nal sketches and watcr colors are
two very interesting vpiumcs of the
collection.

Miss Sheldon graduated in the class
of 1393 and after studying in the Uni-
vcrsitles of. Chicago and California,
and in France, Imly. and Spain, she
returned to Grinnelluvherc she was a
member or the faculty tor eighteen
years, and professor of romance lang-
uages since 1913. The degrees of doc—
tor of lcttcrs and professor emeritus
were conferred by Grinncll college in
June, 1926, preceding Miss Sheldon’s
retirement to potsdam, New York.

At Waahbum College, ii number of

these rules will be deprived of the
use of their cars on the campus.

Tnc presentation of weekly o _ n
recitals will begin the iniddlo cl Octo—

throughout the year. The rccitnls
will be given lly Dr. Knight, Mr. Mat-
lnck; and Loren Adair, Mnrgorct
Smith, and others of the advanced
pupils.

Itlis intended that this year each
program will consist of three items.
two of which shall have definite
academic values: the third to be a
piece of the,audience’s own selection.
Anyone wishing to have a certain

‘piece played may communicate his

request to Dr. Knight. The only
proviso is that jazz will not and can—
not hc played at any time, land such
popular overtures as “Poet and peas-
ant” and "William Tell” will not be
included because they are already
well known to the public. One of the
aims in giving these recitals is to get
the strident acquainted with the lesscr
known compositions.

The practice of giving these rccitals
was inaugurated last year when they
were played every Wednesday after-
noon from 1-3 o‘clock. The interest
shown by the students at that time
has adednhtely warranted their con-
tinuance. '

Ali-SL‘H‘O Men ,

The freshman team this year prom—
'ses to compare favorably with my
first year organization at Grlunell in
sonic time. Among the candidates are
scvcrai men bearing the "allesta "
tag from various states. Considerable
weight seems to be in attendance, and
not a little speed. with the combin—
ation of experience, weight and speed, _
three requisites ' at the yearlings
seem to possess in more or less quark
tity, a team worthy of furnishing the
varsity with some liluchsneeded com—
petition, and also a team to represent
Grinnell well in the game at st. Louis.

Prominent among the new man are
a nice group of backfield men. Liedtke
of Rock Island, Ili., promises to the
velop into a good collcgc ilnc plung-
er; Ruse, Orient, shows considerable
experience in hail—tnting, and tackling.
and weighs in the neighborhood. of
lilo pounds. .Mcoter, Hawardon. and
a brother of the Pioneer llssh, is bears
ing out the claims that he is a better
Prep player than his brother. Mc~
Intyre, Audubon, shows speed and line '
crashing ability that looks‘good; May.
tum, Paullina, is playing a nice gains
at halfback, and Carr, Popoioy is hit-
ting the line with enough force to
mark him as varsity material.
