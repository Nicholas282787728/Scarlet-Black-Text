The students of the tour classses
lion in school are focusing their attcne
tion more and more on the work of the
alumni of Grinucll luv adrit-c and guide
ance. The alumni are todal more and
lnoic interested in lvhat is happening
on the campus-of their alum mater,
and the reeling of responsibili - lor
the future and the standards of the
college is ever) day being more im-
pressed on them by tileir closer relas
tlonsliip witll th college lite. Probably
in few other colleges does the spirit
of student life and inlerest in student
affairs reach so far out among tiiose
who have spent tour seals on a college
campus as does the enthusiastic and
cooperative spirit of tilis college.

It takes an undertaking like the ens
dowincnt drive to bring all of the ele-
ments of the college into closer re-
lationship stud excite a. feeling of real
tamily devotion among members of the
family. A common ground, a come
mon understanding, a common pur-
pose, are essentials of true relation-
ship such as exists between Grinnell
students and alumni, The college as a
material and an ideal body stands as
the monument around which the hopes
of all are built. Common pride in the
keeping of the traditions and customs
of the place so familiar to all keeps
the spark of old time “pep" and en»
Lhusiasm alive in all concerned, and
brings alumni back year otter year,
not only because they want to see
their old friends again, but because
they want to spend a few days in old
surroundings about which they knolv
so much and to which they each have
n peculiar individual attachment. It
means something to them which they
cannot explain. Just to walk across
the campus IS like Singing an old song
to which an individual olten attaches
some singular event.

Most of the students on the campus
will have this feeling some day. If

they do not they will not be true Grins

“every man is the peer or every

again to the question, “Who is respon-

ure, it is of course up to the college
administiation to dismiss the students ‘
from further attendance here, but why
should this year have been wasted as
tai as education is concerned, for so
many? who is lesponsible for keeps
ing it stranger in college in the riglil
track?

A freshman comes to college wiill‘
ideas or his own as to college lite. it‘
does not take long for him to form his -
own customs and associations, and he
does so along the lines he thinks best.
but how can hc, with little oi no zlot-
ual experience, do the best for him
self? ilust there be some guidance?‘

Does he know as much about it, with

no experience, as the man with one or ‘
more years at experience? Can he be:
taught nothing along to lines of the'
former customs of college life and the
demands the new situation is to make
upon him?

Upon whom does this task fall? In
whom does he place most or his con-
liddnce? Not on the dean of men, hilt
on those who have been there before,

l

and are still there. A man. has much i
more i rct for the comments or his
older brother than those of his father,
The only difference is thlt he tries
to Show respect for one, and in the case l
of the mother he hates to let him think
he ran teach him anything, but at theK

same time tries to please him. Such is
the position of the college freshman.
He wants to be like his older hrothe
the upperclassman, but hates to let
him think so, and at the same time
doesn't give a "hung” about what the
dean or men says, but tries to make
him think he does.

The upperclassman of next year
should be looking forward to the du-

We have come upon an editorial in

college, entitled "Listen Seniors",
which we print below. We cannot

writer, who most have had his dreams
of college life badly upset when he
reached \Vashburn. The article lol-

indication of their recognition of the
true state of affairs.

It is a sad thing to observe a, feeling
and a show of contempt for the leader—
ship and station of an upper classman
of things. Showing that the lower
classman, It is a positive indication
of a wrong adjustment of the scheme
of things. showin gthat the lower

solution of the problem presented to
them as college men of ﬁnding their

ing that there is a lack of trust in the
leadership of uppcrelassmen,

Tclllvld worse than that then, is the

Dr. Steiner's central thought was
that we must ourselves become what
we wish the world to be, After first
sketching the chaotic condition of the
world today he said that notwithstand-

so discouraging, Christ still lives and
