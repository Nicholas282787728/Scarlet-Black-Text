star-buck oi Iowzt City,

who is vls 'ng Grillnell under the due»
plces oi the university Extension De—
partment, spoke lost Monday evening
on the subject, “Researches in Person.
allty."

According to Professor starburk, rc.
searches in personality are now bee
coming as exact as any scientitic re~
Search. During the course or his lec-
ture, the Iowa City protessor enumer—
ated several oi the methods which are
being used in the new science oi Cllar~
acter explanation,

The_ iirst method which he described
was that of observation and intuition.
“In using this method," star-buck ex-
plained, "one proceeds exactly in the
same way the chemist or the biologist
proceeds. It is possible to cheer e
only to a certain degre ; atter that, all
depends upon intuition." The second
method or which he spoke was in its
fundamental principles, he said, the
same test that the psychologists very
oiten use. 'Mr:Starhuck has evolved
a system or charts which allows dou—

_ ble analysis; a man’s analysis oi him—
seli, and the unpreiudiced analysis oi
an outsider. By correlating the‘ results
oi these two tests, a iair and scientiﬁc
research in pcrsonality can be made.

Tests For Strident:

Another test or which he spoke will
soon he tried in courses oriered by
Grinnell proiessors, In using this
method, the instructor makes it very
easy ior the students to cheat, but so
arranges the material, that by com-
parison oi papers it can he very easily
determined which students have been
cheating. By a similar plan, tests can
he made which will determine whether
a person will deliberately tell a ialse-
hood. such tests as these, which in—
clude rapid are questions and answers,
are used extensively today in criminal

-procedure, and have met with much
‘success.

The last test starbuck described is
known as the statistical test. This test

involves the correlation of all the oth-'

or tests and deduction to iinal values.
The future value of these tests. the
visiting proiessor thinks, may prove
to be such that no person will be al-
lowed to go abroad without having
some psycho-anal 'st look down inside
oi him iirst to determine the processes
that are going on there.

”Trails or character." he said in
conclusion, “are no longer considered
as things that are carried around with
an individual, nor is it thought that
virtues can be developed by continu—
ally harping on them; it is thought,
rather, that personality is developed
by educational processes oi associa-
tion.”

Local Cinder Artists Should Make a.
Strong Bitl For High Honors in
Annual 21L V. Meet.

The nialtease cross track artists are
working out daily in preparation for
the Missouri Valley indoor track meet
to be held at Kansas City, March 21.

Coach Huff has not yet selected the
team that will make the trip out it is‘
expected that he will send a large
squad in an eiiort to capture the meet.
The chances oi winning the indoor
classic ore better than they have been
ior several years judging irom the tal-
ent oi the cindcr path periormers who
are taking their daily laps in the gym.

Captain Taylor is being counted on
as a heavy point winner in the hon;
dies, and one oi the main cogs in the
relay teams. Floyd Green has been
doing nice work in topping the sticks
this year and he will probably push
Taylor. Prospects in the dashes are
rather uncertain but at the present the
outlook is rosy. L. Jones, the dimin<
utive veteran is looking good in early
tryouts and Scharnweber 's showing
great promise. The latter has a
world oi power and a great stride and
he ought to make seine iast time this
year it he develops as expected.

M. Jones, stotts and Kitchen are
among the pick oi the ouarter miiers
who will run in the 440 dash and
help compose the mile relay quartet.
Kitchen is going great this season and ‘
the idct that he will not compete at,
Kansas City will weaken Pioneeri
chances.

‘ilruur Distance, )rcu

Tom Gould looks like a point wine,
her in the mile and hali mile and,
Breitenbnch, Howard, King and Julie
are also to be considered in the dis-
tancc eventst; Meyer, Whitley ahd‘
ll'oodruii are running the two mile
race. ‘

The Pioneer track team will be,
,weakcst in the iield events ior out—,
side oi the shot put there is little,
hopes oi scoring. However in the
weight heaving Rinciort and Mceter
are capable of distances that mayi
place. The tormer may not be up to
iorm in the valley meet ior he is re»
covering irom an illness and has not,
yet regained his strength. Bogs, who
is also a fair shot putter has just tin—
.‘islietl basketball and he has not yet
reported ior track.’

Injuries or ineligibilitics may weak~
en the team or the rapid development
or “dark horses" may strengthen it
betore the big meet, but it almost
certain that the Maltcase cro , will
make a stronger bid for points than
ever beiore.
