FAIRNESS TOWARD RUSSIA.

What would happen if n large percentage of col-
lege students today were required to give their opin—
ion of the Bolshevik government in Russia? In all
probability, with a lack of knowledge aided by curs
rent American propaganda .against Russian they
would condemn that government because of its Corns
munistic form, and in the same breath would indict
it as a potential menace to_ world peace. If they had
read a few articles by typical American writers, on
Russia, they would likely laugh at the efforts of the
Bolshevik government to rehabilitate that country.

Would such statements be accurate? Hardly. The
answer of a much smaller percentage of college Stu»
dents would be far different. They would recognize
that in Russia today is being carried on a really great
experiment, that the Soviet government Is no greater
menace to world peace than the other nations of the
World make it and that the wide-spread alarm over
Communist propaganda is almost entirely without
base.

This is not a defense of Communism, but a. plea
that we adopt a fairer attitude toward Communism
in Russia and restricted to Russia. One of the finest
contributions to such an attitude is now being present-
ed by Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of the “Nation,"
in the columns of that magazine. After spending a
part of last summer travelling in Russia, he is now
publishing a series of six articles, three of which have
already appeared. While not hesitating to condemn
certain Bolshevik policies, he presents a vigorous de-
fense' or the Soviet government the: it is well for one
to read, whether he agrees with it or not.

So far, Mr. Villard has sounded three dominant
notes. First, he details the multitude of problems
which the Bolshevik government has had to face in
the last seven years since civil war was quelled. and
gives some account of the Herculean efforts it is mak—
ing to bring Russia. out of its centuries of backward-

are desirious of world peace and finally, that America
can greatly help Russia, to get on its feet by immediate
recognition of the Soviet government.

Russia to a. standard of happiness, efficiency and prose
perity ccmparuble to that of Germany, France or

mated those standards.” Continuing in the same
strain, the famous editor tells just what the Russian
government has had to do, Faced with s country

a new government, start wide-spread education among
a people only 20 percent literate, enact a code of new
laws, modernize the entire antiquated industrial ma‘
chine. Beyond this, the Soviet government is fever-
ishly at work creating new industries, power plants,
factories of every kind to “raise Russia literally over-
night to the industrial level of the United States."

Contrary to popular American belief, the Soviets
really desire to be a peaceful government. True, they
are developing s huge army, but on the ground that
all the capitalist nations of the world are allied
against them Their armaments are for defense, not
for offense, they claim, through Mr. Villerd points out
that such a policy makes for war rather than for
peace. The strongest wish the government has is to
be left alone to work out its plans for Russia; fear
that it will not be is the basis of the present army.

The United States, we believe, should recognize
Russia. The availability of American capital would
become easier to the great power now rising in the
East. The Bolshevik government would thus be given
an opportunity to hasten its vast program. a program
which aims at education and a chance for culture for
the masses, development of Russian industries so that
famine may be wiped out and a higher level of living
introduced, and puts the welfare of the worker in in-
dustry first. These are humanitarian aims, in large
part, rather than Communistic; if we can help them
along, American recognition of Russia would be e cons
structive step.

May we repeat that this is not a defense of Com-
munism for America? It is a plea for a fair attitude
toward Communism restricted to Russia, that. on the
basis of its achievements in the past seven years, the
Bolshevik government be given, in the words of Hugh
L. Cooper, great American engineer now in Russia,
“every opportunity t try out communism," that they
be kept in power “ui 1 they work out the changes now
necessary in Russian life.” To aid them, we should
recognize their government, as soon as possible.

Americans interested in justice and fairness to an
over-maligned government await eagerly Mr. Villard's
last three articles, hoping that the whole series will
contribute to a new American attitude toward Russia.
