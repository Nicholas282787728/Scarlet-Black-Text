scores oi Drake's tirst two games seem
to indicate that the Bulldog team is
weaker than they should he on the
derensive. Utah scored 14 points
against them, and Kn - scored 10,
but their strong otrensire was able to
minimize those counters. probably
the weakest part of the Drake team
is the center of the line, and that
weakness will undoubtedly be Dlaytrl
upon today. in addition, Coaches
Hyland and Black have quite a tow
tricks up their sleeves that the Drake
scouts did not get in on by watching
the Pioneers play their ﬁrst two
games, while the score or the Drake»
Knox game last Saturday seems it
indicate that the Bulldogs had to our

of the “'itshmglon game. Rineiort at
tackie, and Peterson at center. proved 1

satisfactory last week, so they will
probably be seen at the same hos .

Cathcart and Martin at guards, and
J‘Vinter and ltcClain at ends, The

been displaying a strong game both ltt

down the other lllllfrllncln'. position,
with Moran at filllbhck, and Stotls
again at quarter, a new reliabie
backtield man was unearthed last'
week in “Buster” Kinget‘y, a letter
man from last year who was consid

ed too light for this year's team, and
he my got in the game at Sweet's’
place in case the latter needs a rest.
