WAITING FOR WHAT---WAITING UNTIL-n

YOU SECURE LESS FOR THE SAME MONEY? The young man, in arranging for a Life Insurance
estate, enjoys one great advantage; every dollar that he deposits secures a larger sum this year than
it will next year,~~so every year of delay means that the dollars buy less and less. If this condition
were true of any other of the purchases you make, how long would you delay? ‘

YOU ARE UNINSURABLE? This is not an imaginary danger but a very 1eal one. Thousands of men
are denied the advantages of Insurance Protection each year, just because they waited Uninsurable
men live half— 1ives because they a1e forced to do single handed what they might do many, many

imes easier unde1 the co— ope1ative Life Insurance plan.

ARE YOU MARRIED? The young man who waits until he 1s married 15 simply forcing his wife to help

beai the extra cost of the plan an extra cost because he' 1s older and his 1ate 1s higher

YOL DIE? About the ﬁrst principle of independence and honorableness Is to leave enough so that the

Doctor’s bills and the funeral expenses will be paid by you. If you should die, tonight, and you

might, who is going to have to pay your funeral bills? '

YOL HAVE TOO MANY EXPENSES? After you have established that home which is certain to come

someday, the time will come to you as it comes to other men when you won’t be able to see your way
clear to add“ even another nickle.” Why not have the plan started under way, a part of the budget
and partially paid for before that time comes? ‘
YOL SEE YOUR BIG OPPORTUNITY G0 BY? Someday, it comes to every man, you will see your big
chance to go into business for yourself. The credit— collateral strength of a Life Insurance Contract,
well under way helps in the job of ﬁnancing—but perhaps without it you are helpless—and another
man 3 name goes over the door
YOL HAVE FAILED AT OTHER SAVING PLANS? The Life Insurance system of regular deposits,
1egula1 in amount and at regular intervals is the easiest and most efficient method ever devised
, or saving Thousands of men who cannot save a cent by any other method are building up hand-
some sums through the Life Insurance Plan
YOI. HAVE LOST IN “GOOD” INVESTMENTS? Money comes too hard and 1s worth too much for the
useless and painful business of investingeandlosing. Why wait until you, too have learned the
lesson that investing' is not child’s play. Why not save your self the agony—and the money by
investing your money in guaranteed Life Insurance contracts, to meet your p1 esent and future

 

 

 

“Pooled Experience
Speaks With Absolute
Authority On Economic
Problems.”

PRESIDENT COOLIDGE

“Insurance is the modern method by
which men make the uncertain certain,
and the unequal equal. It is the means
by which success is almost guaranteed.
Every Insurance policy is a declaration
of independence, a charter of economic
freedom.”

JOHN WANAMAKER

“As the result of my own thinking,
I deliberately worked out this conclu-
non:

“That Life Insurance was one of the
best form: of investment, because it
gave, after one deposit, on instant guar-
antee that might repay principal and
interest and more.’

'WHAT SUCCESSFUL MEN SAY ABOUT LIFE INSURANCE

"The Bigger the Man the
Heartier His Indorsement

Of Life Insurance”

HERBERT HOOVER

“I often wonder why it is that
insurance must be secured by solici-
tation. It is due only to one thing
and that is to the lack of apprecia-
tion of the fundamental character of
the investment, on invesment-in-sav—
ings in a form that brings not only a
direct return from the savings but
also an enormous return'in social
benefits.”

ROGER W. BABSON

“Life Insurance is a far more im-
portant savings institution than is
commonly realized. Life Insurance
policies have a savings feature of
tremendous volume.”

.I. HOWARD ARDREY

“No man engaged in business,
whether in partnership or by individ-
ual effort, who assumes financial ob-
ligations, can afford to be without
insurance. I believe the time will
come when creditors generally will
require the firms to which credit I:
granted to have as adequate protec-
tions on the lives of their pnncipals
as they now require an the merchan-
dise and property they hol ."
