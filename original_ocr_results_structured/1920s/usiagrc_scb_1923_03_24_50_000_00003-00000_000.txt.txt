PIONEER lHlﬂK TEAM
‘ GDES ll] KANSAS Bill

Huff Takes Squad of Eight Men.
to Missouri Valley Indoor
Track Classic.

‘Doc‘ Huti and his Pioneer track

men leit Grinnoll Thursday night for
Kansas City, where they will partich
pate today in the annual Missouri
Valley conrercnce indoor track meet
,‘which will he held in Convention
‘Hall,
3 Making the trip with Hurt are
Green, Taylor, Hass, Meyer, McIli'ath.
Entrants
in the meet were limited to those who
showed the hest signs of being point
winning possihilihes,

From the results ot the Grinnell~
Allies—Drake indoor meet it is pos~
sih‘ie to’ pick Grinnell's bets in the
meet today—Green, Taylor, Mcllrath.
Meyer. and the relay event.

Green is 'gaining strength in the
dash, especially at the start. llis
hurdle form is good.‘ and should win
points tor the Scarlet and Black.
Taylor is running him a close second
in the high hurdles. although he is
not expected to place in the high
jump.

Melllath and licyer should come‘
through today. Mac won his race at
Amos hdudily, and can he counted on
as mighty keen competition ior any-
one. llieyer came in a strong sccond
at Amos, and had he known more the
‘llow' of. things would have been vic-
torious.

The mile relay team, composed or
llcllrdth, Gillette. Porter, and Taylor,
will prohahlr place. Ames is doped
to win the event.

The Des Mollie: Register. in doping
the outcome oi the meet, gives Kansas
University first place with thirty
points, Nebraska second with twenty-
iive, Missouri third with twenty-two.
'and Ame: and the Kansas Aggies a tie
tor fourth with nineteen each. Grin—
nell follows with three points, ohla—
homa two, Washington one, and Drake
none. . A

Gl'innell's three points 'accox'dlng t9
the dope sheet, are made in the hur-

other possibility, although the story
gives Gn'zmell more credit.

“Coach Hult’," the story reads, "has
long been tan-ions fur turning

dies. No provision is made zor any‘

and dashes. In addition to Green Grin- l
;nell has Haas, who was tonnerly
Volley dash champ and is now in
Eschool alter a long absence." 1
in thc hall mile Ames is given sec- I
:ond with Hammer-icy, and Gi'inuell is
"not placed. Mcllrath dctcatcd Ham-l
merley easily in the triangular. .
The two mile is dope‘d‘soniewhat
the same. “Allies is sure or a placo
‘hecause she always turns out good
‘distance men.” grinnell is not placed,
‘nut lilsycr should iigure strongly in
this event. i
The Pioneers pushed Ames to the
‘utmost heiore dropping the mile re-
‘lay two weeks ago, but are given no
credit tor it. At Kansas City they
larc paired with Oklahoma in the re-
;lay, which will he run against time.
