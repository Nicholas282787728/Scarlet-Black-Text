Paul Blanchard, New York
Economists Here Thursday

5

Mr. Paul Blanchard at New York
City will address a joint meeting of
_the y. M. c. A. and the r. w. c. A. to
he held in the A. R. H. auditorium next
Thursday evening on the subject, “La,-
hor's Attitude Toward Christianity."

According tD Prof. NI. J. Bradshaw,
who has heard Mr. Blanchard lecture,
his speeches are just as interesting
ident Conference lecturer who has
.been received so well here.
'according to Junior Wood, '25, the
lectures' of these two men will not
overlap although the speakers have
many ideas in common.

The New York man is primarily an
economist, . but his interests are large-
ly centered in the social aspects or
modern industrial problems. In ad-

dition to having charge of the short
lChnpel services on both Thursday and
‘F‘ridny mornings, he will probably
=conduct open forum discussions in
several of the Economics and Sociol—
ogy classes. Because or his wide ex~
perience in addressing college and uh-
iversity students, air. Blanchard is
eminently fitted to give these lectures.

All Iootball men and their coaches

teams, the five student presidents
and a few or the most enthusiastic
boosters from the schools of the asso—
ciation will hold a banquet at the
'Shirley Savory hotel in Denver some
time this fall.

Dear Doric:

1 see by your last issue that you
are deeply interested in the when, 1
how, what, where, and why or a certain
character referred to as DENVER
RED ,now you may think from this
letter that 1 have seen or heard or
such an individual. This is correct.

His description is very, very simple.
I would say that he is or tallish me—
dium height, not short noi tall. His
features are cicohed, his haii darhish
light. and his legs symetrical.

Getting down again'to simple facts.
I know the whereabouts of just this
Denver Red, but, as one high class
business man said to another h. c. 11.

or these tributes, is a subject which
deals not with absolutions, but with
the existing relativity of things, since
it alone leads to a trozen mind, but
puiticipates freely of all the rivers of

History, the second phase or the
river of truth, is no longer an ab—
stract study of the past, but is now
telescoped into our immediateness and
includes all arlairs of the day. Philos-
ophy as advanced by modern philoso-

of those theories studied by the an-
cients. But history and philosophy
both tend m abstraction.
