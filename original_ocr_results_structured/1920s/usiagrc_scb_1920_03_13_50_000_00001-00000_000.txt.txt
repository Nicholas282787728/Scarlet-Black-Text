"The social unit as A speciﬁc plan
for working out the organization of the
community more completely and more
efficiently” was discussed by Mrs.
Mary Clarke Burnett, executive of the
Social Workers Council of Cincinnati,
at the Y. W. meeting Thursday evening,
As worked out in one district of Cin-
cinnati, this plan provides for the div
vision of the city into blocks of about
one hundred families each. Each
block has a council of seven members
elected by the people and this council
chooses a representative to Slt on the
general council for the city or dis
trict, lifrs. Eurnett showed how this
system could be applied to the small
town and what need there is for co-
operation in the modern complex life.

She told of the results obtained in
developing a spirit at neighhcrliness
and brotherhood and in givingpcople
an opportunity to express their abili-
ties. The block Workers organize and
introduce into the homes the skilled
workers, such as doctors and nurses.
for general health campaigns and anti-
tuberculosis work.

The social unit organization may be
used in campaigns for Americanlzing
foreigners and for better housing and
better recreation, by developing symr
patby between the foreigners and the
native born citizens. It Will help
solve economic and social problems
and is especially applicable to rural
districﬁ.

Both Contests Close —
Decided by Two to
One Vote. '

(Special to the Scarlet and Black)

Mt. Vernon, 10., March 12. — The
Cornell affirmative team won a two to
one decision over the Grinncll nega-
tive in a. debate held here tonight. The
debate was close both as to argument
and delivery throughout. Cornell hav—
ing the edge in delivery. Linn Smith
dill thc most brilliant work for the
visitors. He delivered a powerful re—
butttal speech. Marvel Stockwell do»
serves high honors for the Cornell
team. Glenn Fishbaugll, Hobart
Dawson and Marvel Stocklvell made
up the Cornell team. Harry Barnes,
Ronald Bochnllcr and Linn Smith rep-
resented Grinuell. Tile judges were
J. J. Hall, Dean of Law at Chicago Uni-
versity, Professor M. M. Fogg of the
English Department of Nebraska
Uniyel ty. and George Vantungeln,
Professor of Economics at Allies.

The Grinnell affirmative team won
over the Carleton negative team by a
two to one vote, hcrc, last night. The
question is‘:
“Rcsfllvefl: That Con’ress Should
Enact Legislation Providing for Coni-
pulsnry Arbitration in All Labor Dis-
putes of Public Service Corporations."
The debate was a thriller from start
to ﬁnish, and was featured by clear
thinking and excellent delivery. Both
teams proved themselves exception-
ally stl‘ong in rebuttal, the Work of the
affirmative being especially good. A
small but enthusiastic audience at—
tended the debate which was one of
the best ever heard on the local plat»
form.
The judges for the local debate were
Dean McGoV'ney of the State University
Law School, Professor Case, Eco-
nomics Department, State University.
and Professor Meyerholtz of the Po-
litical Science Department of thestate
Teachers' College at Cedar Falls. Pro<
lessor Cochran, Carleton coach, has
been incapacitated for the past two
weeks, and was unable to acocmpany
his team, sending Mr. Duns, a former
Carleton debater, in his stead. Profes—
sor J. P. Ryan, head of the Gl‘iunell
Speech Department, and coach of the
Grinnell debaters, was the chairman
of the evening.

Kelly Opens Case.

Joseph Kelly opened the case for the
affirmative with a brief history of the
question. With a clear and concise
statement of the situation, together
with it deﬁnition and restatement of
the question. Kelly started the coin
structive work of the debate but was
called on time. John Bartlett contin-
ued the work for the affirmative,
building an excellent case that was
both clear and constructive. Mason
Tedd Concluded the case for the at-
firmative with a forceful speech that
cleared many hitherto obscure points.
Ladd rested tlle case for tlleaffirma—
tive with a b ‘ef summary of the af—
ﬁrmative contention, and a reiterance
of the issues of the question.

Roland Moore was the ﬁrst speaker
for the negative. He took up the cud-
gels for his team by denying part of
the affirmative deﬁnition of the ques-
lien, and by asking a number of dues-
tiolis. Moore proved himself to bc a
forceful speaker, and a keen thinker.
H. Philip Constans w. the second
speaker for the negative. He briefly
reviewed the arguments of his fellow
(lclizttel', find continued the effort to
destroy the atfirnlfttive case. Wen<
(lflll Rogers concluded the main
Speeches of the debate with an excel-
lent review of the situation and a
forceful pica against compulsory arbi~
ti-ation.

Rebuttals Fast.

The rebuttal work of both teams Was
fast and furious, and kept the studi-
ence keyed up throughout the entire
period. All of the Carleton men were
effective in this branch, as well as in
their main speeches. Both Kelly and
Ladd drew an occasional laugh from
the crowd in their rchuttals, While
Bartlett limited himself to driving a.
number of vital Statistics home.

The debate schedule with Cornell.
and Carleton was not strictly zt trl-
Singular as has been the Case in (or--
ll'ier years. By special consent, Cor-
nell and Carleton substituted debates
with Lawrence College of Appleton,
Wisconsin, for their customary con-
flict, However, the contest is still
Considered as a triangular. Carleton
was the victor in their contest with
Lawrence, winning by a two to one de-
cisioh.
