All editorial appearing iii the SCARLET AND BLACK

on December 1 1928 stated, "Tile tact that the council
of house chairmen saw tit to regard President linin's
letter as an order couched in a friendly and courteous
manner, ye an order nevertheless, would indicate that
the _ntention ot the president was to issue an order. If
this is the case, it is unfortunate that the letter was sent
to the house chaii'man.‘ ' '

Tile editorial goes on to say “Assuming that the letter

The conclusion nl‘ the editorial mentioned net‘orc was
that an order from the president was inconsistent with
