upon the completion of the work of

TION 0F MARINE SUBSIDY

"Millions for ship owners but not
one cent for soldiers" is the prophecy
being made by Washington correspom
dents with regard to the new legisla-
tion urged by President Harding with
regard to a government subsidy for
the merchant marine, Despite the
fact that Senator Copper, head of the
farm bloc, had denounced such meats
ures, the president sent his message
to the senate on the grounds that
America has a huge merchant marine
which must be maintained and that a
subsidy is cheaper than selling the
vessels.
