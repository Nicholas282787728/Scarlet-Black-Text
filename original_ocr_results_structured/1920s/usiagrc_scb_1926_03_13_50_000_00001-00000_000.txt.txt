Miss Sydney Thompson‘s second
program in Grinnell was quite as
much of a success as her first. The
harmonious colurings 01 Miss Thompr
son’s costumes and their graceful
lines are a delight to the beauty lov—
ing eye; her geycty and verve are
full of charm,

Both of the original one act plays
gave opportunity for the presentation
Di :3. part Miss Thompson interprets
admirably, that of the cynically wise
woman or the world. While mono—
logues in form. these plays emphasize
.dctlon more and character less than
‘does the dramatic monologue. Miss
Thompson's gestures and stage dir-
ections gave something of the illus-
ion of stage presentation. both plays
would have gained, however. by rcp—

. resentation of the protagonist’s rea'c—

tion to the dramatic situation. One can
imagine the spectator's delight as he
become increasingly aware that the
lover in "The Missing Years" was not
the unsophi cated clergyman that
his childhood sweetheart, the opera
singer is condescending to, but quite

As it is, the sudden denounccrncnt has
an anccdotnl flavor.
Weakness Apparent

This weakness was even more an.

left unconvinced that the woman
secret agent’s charm is sufficient to
make her not very plausible "yarn"

rich trusted with his country‘s most
valuable state papers. Perhaps, how.
ever, Miss Thompson's very individual
and charming voice would not‘lend

parts.

it is most admirably suited to the
setting forth of the quaint charm of
mediaeval ballads. Hcr reading is a
happy admixture of seriousness and
fun. Readers of the ballad often err
in too solemn an attempt to reproduce
what they conceive to be the module—
vel audience’s attitude. Miss Thomp~
son was a pioneer in the semi—did
mettle presentation of ballads in cos
tume. Her medieeval gown in gorge-
ous yellows and blue is an artistic
triumph. She turned to good no—
couut even the slight mishap to it by
her quick wit and gay informality.

While Miss Thompson preserved the
iine dignity of Malory’s tale of that

lot and Cumlverc, her vision was not
so much an "adaptation" as a re

working of his stoly. It is not until.

the proposed s_ ‘tcm of llllificationi

clash of authority throughout the,’
evening, the affirmative quoting from;
one report and the negative froln an-l

very freely and adhered closely to
the argumentative tactics which, un-
til reccntl, were universal in Amerr
ion. ,The Grinncll speakers talked
more informally and relied less on
figures than on a digest of facts pre-
sented with considerable attention to
popular appeal.

Randolph Hewitt pointed out the
ways in which the present scheme of
defense and particularly the existing
air program are adequate for the‘
needs of the notion. John Pierson’s’
fir-st appedl'auce as an intercollegiate
dcbotcr proved him to be orlc of the
strongest rncrnbcrs of the Grinncll!
squad. Cleverly and forcefully he re-
futed the affirmative points, and then
proceeded to offer one of thc mosti
