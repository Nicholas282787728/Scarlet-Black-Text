Brailsford Says Outlnwry of War
Should Begin In DockrYdrds
Besides Papers.

OUTLINES CRUISER PROBLEM

Speaker Points Out Misllake Made
By England in Getting Aid
Of France In Dispute.

“If we wont to outlaw It is
not enough to do it in our hearts and
on paper; we ilillst begin ill the docks
.vru-dst" stated H. N. Bl-ailstord, out-
standing English public t, ill a lee»
ture on “Cruisers aiid (To-operation"
Thursday evening in i-ierrick chapel.
“We imlst stop building against one
another."

.\li'. Eraiisford traced the cruiser
problem through the Great war, the
Washington conference, and the Gen-
eva conference up to tile present day.
with llnusual lucidit He concluded
with the constructive suggestion that
America should give her support to
the decisions or tile League or Na»
tions, and so avoid the necessity of
iiaving a competitive navy,

“We were ready to build against
any conlbination of naval powers on
the eve of the Great War,” Mr. Bl'itils-
ford said, “Then came the naval cons
ference at Washington, in 1922. You
remember that the British empire
agreed to an equality oi naval pow.
er with the United States. But sus-
picion grew up. The lesser powers
objected to having a fixed limit for
the smaller ships, and uniortunately
the conference broke up. it was not
your fault, and it was not ours.

New Typo Evolved.

“Then, unfortunately, a new kind
of cruiser became the fashion: the
10,000 ton cruiser with eightrinch
guns, Your experts delayed, then be
came alarmed, They thought it tilne
to call another conterencc; so we met
at Geneva,

"Both governments committed an
act of sheer imbecility in going into
that conterence with admirels to rep»
resent them," Mr. Brailsford felt, “The
conference tailed because we both
made that naive mistake. The plain
iact was, the admirals were calculat-
lng tor an AnglorAmerican war. oin-
ioreign minister recently stated tllat
war between the two countries was
unthinkable. Eut plenty of people con-
trive to think the unthinkable. clay
and night."

Compromise Falls.

The English admirals wanted small
6.000 ton cruisers with ti-incb guns
to police their sca roads, while the
Americans wanted 10,000 ton cruisers
with eightrinch guns. "that could
knock any number ot $000 ton cruis-
ers into the middle of next week."
The British offered a compromise on
7-inch guns, but were refused; and
the conference broke up.

"There is no meaning in ltialllematir
lal equality, and it makes no ditier-
encc, if we are not going to light
each other!” Mr. nrailsrord pointed
out.

After the conlcrcncc, the lecturer
said, ”England made the mistake or
getting France to back her in the
cruiser dispute. As a result or our
blunder," he continued, “came the Am—
erican cruiser bill. 1mmedialely came
the British reply, The race has be.
gun, and I think it distllrbs us worse
than it does you. We have lived
through the war with Germany. it
too hogan with admirals' arithmetic

“George Wa, lgioll was as much

loved equally to honor anti respeci

“The more we try to get away iroln
this common heritage. ihe less we

greatest reverence to Washington's
memo , we must think in wider.
more sweeping unitles as he hilllseli
wished for his country, in terms at
creative international relations," ,
Er ‘lsiord declared,

eorgc Washington," he said,
“could never have conceived the
world in which we are living, There
was no spirit oi prophecy, bllt only
practical considerations, for the young
nation in his words when he told his
people to avoid entangling alliances."
The traditional American, incapable
at seeing the ical scope of his higr
ness. has seized upon this little
phrase, and held it dognlalically, let.»
ting it stand in the way of organiza-

Drake 15 Given Slight Edge Over
Grinnell In Annual Track
Meet In Des Moines.

Seventeen irac lien lei‘t iol- Des
Moinc tl s morning and competed in
the Dl'dlie indoor meet this .literuoou.
('cach Lester Duke has spent this
week ironing out the kin which
showed up in thc DrtlkerAnles tri»
angular it week ago.

Probably the biggest upset of the
meet tor Grinnell was the nubbing
oi second place in the pole vault by
Hensley, a sophomore, while his team-
mate, Greene. a Senior, who holds the
collage record, tied for fourth. The
knowledge that he has had some still
competition for his berth should spur
Greene on to the high spots.

One of the cheering notes of the
opening meet or the season tor Coach
Duke was the showing of Hugh Ed»
wards, who placed fourth in the hall
mile and was barely nosed out or
third Distance events had practical-
ly been counted out hi the Grinllell
point events this year but Edwards
may show the Bulldogs something
odd,

Wank Iu Fii'ltl ENIIN

The Pioneers were woefully weak
in the ﬁeld events at Allies and there
is no prospect of bettering that status
until Mommy and Ingram become
eligible with the ending- of the has-
kctball season. With the exception of
the pole vault Gm’nnell showed noth-
ing worth while on the tield and
Drake will probably take all the
points in the high jump and shot pill.
The Bulldogs will have things much
their own way in the sprints, too,
led by Parks, who had a bad night
at Allies.

McKec, crack Grinncll ullitrtel'rmilr
er. is out for revenge against Hon,
who nosed llinl out at Alnes, and Toy-
lor, whose showing ill the hurdles at
Ames was creditable considering that
he had been in training only two
weeks, should improve greatly in
the next few weeks, For the meet
today, however. matters appear to
be just about a toss-up, with Drake
holding a sligllt edge, Duke is doing
his best to spur his lilen to greater
things, however, and an upset in a
single event may turn the tables.
