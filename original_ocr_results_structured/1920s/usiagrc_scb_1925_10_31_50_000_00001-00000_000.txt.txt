The Pioneers will help to provide
the entertainment for the annual
homecoming crowd at stillwater in a
Valley tilt this afternoon, Both
teams are anxious for a victory as it
will boost their standing in the Valley
race and the Aggies especially will
want to chalk up a rictory beiorc the
old grade.

The Aggies will be represented by
a husky line and a fast backfield, a
combination that will be hard to stop.
Their forte is the forward pass and
they have used the overhead gsmc

The lows State student conference
to he held at Des Moines, Navember
13, 14 and 15, is an intercollegiate as-
sembly of college and university men
and women to discuss all phases of
college life, and is ’held under the
direction of the Y. M. C. 1L and Y. W.
C. A, of Iowa. Miss Margaret Sayers

of the state University is chair-man of»

the conference.

D . Robert L, Kelly who is a main»
ber of the Administrative Committee
of Federal Council of churches, Edi—
tor of Christian Education and A550»
ciatcd American College Bulletins,
and author of many books on educa-
tion, will speak on the present educth
tional system as it rclafes to life
purposes.

Dr. Bruce A. Curry, author or “Fae
ins Studcnt Problems," and director
of Bible study groups in colleges and
umvcrsitics in tilil'tl-five states in the
last two years, was chosen by the
delegates of the last conference to The
turn this year.

Hon. J. Stitt Wilsmi who is well
known to students of Grinnell through
his lectures here last year will speak
on ”Creative and Humanistic Educa-
tion.” Mr. Wilson was one of the
most popular speakers at Geneva for
years and has lectured in all the im—
portant colleges and universities in
the United states.

Dr. Irma E. Voigt, Dean of Women
at Ohio onlversrtv, member of the
institute of politics of Williams Col
logo, and chairman of the commission
preparing a report on "Social and
Moral influences and Agencies in In-
stitutions or Higher Learning" has
also been chosen as a speaker ,

About sixty delegates are expect—
ed to attend the convention from
Grinnell, but due to the football game
that week and thcrc will be no chins
paign to interest the students in at-
tending.

Several Grinncll people, who at-
tended the conference last year, are

several Grinncll people. who attended

“The student Conference starts
you thinking and we do too little
thinking," says Professor 1.. P. Sher-
man, “everyone who can arrange his
work so that he can attend the con-
ference this year will never regret
doing so,

"These conferences are good be—
cause they take away narrow mind-
cdness and gives you a wider view
point. Last year’s conference was the
most stimulating thing i have been
to since I came to Grinnell; it stimu—
lates students to independent and con-
structive thinking. Everyone who
gets a chance should attend. Cars
were furnished last year and will
probably be Illmishetl again thisycar.

“I don’t want to give advice," said

ly to give you a few recent medita-
tious of some things that 1 would do
if I were to attend college again."

He stated that the til-st thing would
be to take a quiet look around—to see
just what the college offers. We are
apt to over-look many things such as
the library, Y. M. C, A., church rela-
tions and outside activities.

The second not should be a search-
ing look inward, not for morbid in—

is my purpose here?"

Next should come a long look ahead
—tn put something aside each day for
the marrow, thus avoiding thc hand

called living a plusvllle.

And finally, one should take a

Last week's Valley games saw no
startling upsets, and the conference
leaders came through with victories.
Missouri and Am’es continued theirf
advances toward the championship by
downing the Kansas Aggics and
Washington. respectively, Drake
took another conference win by dc-
feating Grinnell, and Nebraska had
little trouble in quelling Kansas.

Missouri nosed out the Aggies by
the margin of a field goal by Capt.
Whitman. It was a hard fought at-
fair and the 3 to a score indicates its
closeness. The Missouri line failed
to function as in the past and the
Kansans were able to keep the battle
even until the very end.

Alues 11ml Scare

Arnes had a tough time with the
Pikers and only through a last quar-
ter rally were they able to come on
top with a 2x to 13 score. The st.
Louis outfit put up a great fight and
Allies was forced to open up a passing
offense in order to score,

in a real gridiiun battle Drake nose
ed out the Grinncll Pioneers for a 7
to (i victory. Grinnell forced the
Bulldogs into three safeties and were
‘weli on their way for u touchdown
when Drake got the benefit of a call-
plc of breaks and passed their way to
a touchdown. The extra point proved
to be the margin of victory in the
closest game ever played between
these two rivals.

Huskers Dangerous

Nebrask pulled the expected in win-
ning over Kansas, 14 to o, and show-
ed that they were still capable of
handling a main sized job, The Huska
er backlicld functioned for the first
time this tall and from now on the
Nebraska offense should steadily im-
provc. Injuries have played a dis
aster-oils role in the Kansas camp,
and they are far from being in shape,

In non-Conference games, the 0k»
lahoma sooner-s heat the southern
Methodist university, 9 to d, This
game was no real test of the winner's
ability, and it is certain that Owen’s
outfit can produce better results. The
Oklahoma Aggies showed a reversal
of form in downing the Texas Chris-
tian university by n 22 to 7 score. For
the first time this season the Aggie
team got going and from now on will
be a tough one to stop.

Important Grimes Today

Today is bargain day in ghc valley
loop, with the Missoui'irAmes clash
conning the headlines, Each has two
victories under its belt and a loss to
day practically eliminates the loser
from title aspirations. Both Amos
and the Tigers wcnt into a slump last
week and failed to show why they are
leading the circuit. Possibly both
were held in check for today's game,
and if this is true the outcome is a
toss-up. Last year’s game went to
Missouri by a 7 to 0 margin.

All games this week are between
Valley contenders, so followers may
check up on scores and strength.
Drake is down at Lawrence to decide
a feud hanging over from last year's
6 to 6 tie. Both teams are in bird
shape due to injuries, but one is as
hard hit as the other, so the outcome
of the game will be little affected by
substitutions. it should proveatight
struggle.

Oklahama is at Nebraska, to de-
fend a 14-7 victory of 1924. The Husk~
crs are favored to win this year. but
not without a strong fight from Ben-
ny Owen's outfit, Nebraska \yztrd

Will Judge Beauty
C ntest for Annual

The announcement last week that
Richard Barthelmess, famous movie
actor, will judge the 1927 Cyclone
beauty contest has aroused consider»
able interest in the contest on the
local campus.

The whole plan of the contest, as
evolved by the Cyclone board, re-
solves itself into two parts: first, to
ascertain are ten girls adjudged by
campus comment to the most beau~
tiful in the student body; second, to
receive from Bartheimess the selec-
tion of the five prettiest.

The method of ascertaining campus
opinion will be handled through votes
snveh with each subscription to an
annual. The portraits of the tenw-in-
lllng girls will then be taken by Child
and forwarded to Barthelmess. Each
of the five final winners'wili receive
a lull page in the beauty section of
the Cyclone. Through this plan, the
the stutlcnls actually make the hour»
inations and A noted judge or beauty
makes the critical selections.

The entire contest lJZLS been placed
under tlle Supervision of David MOr
Coriiglck and will be handled under
his direction. The names of the ten
girls selected by the student body will
not be divulged by Mr. McCormick
and the [mill Winners will be kept it
secret until the appearance of the
hook on June 1.

HHSHANABEH FLIGHT"

New English 1’Iibl ‘ttiou With Gard
as Editor Hits Two of Faculty mill
Four Students on Smifp ‘

The Tanager lifts scheduled her
first flight for November 26. And.
despite the rapacity of the campus
killen, she expects to make three
later ahpcnrauces during the college
year. The Tanager is the new publi—
cation of the English department,
succeeding last year's Junta.

The [iagstafi of the literary quart-
erly will carry as editor the name of
Wayne Gard, instructor in jouruah
ism, and as associate editors the
names of two) other inculty members,
Harry Mack and Eleanor Lowdcn, and
four students, Roma Kaufman.
Frank Dewey, Loren Reid, and Mar»
Surat Lemley.

November 2 has been set as the
deadline for the initial issue. All ma-
terial submitted for the first number
must be in the hands oi the editors at
this time. The columns are open to
all students, teachers, and alumni. The
editors have set no restriction on the
nature of the material which they
will use, but are asking for all kinds
of verse, prose sketches, short store
les, oneract plays and informative and
critical articles. “They will consider
everything irom a sonnet on a dead
cat to an attack on Phi Beta kappa,"
says Gard.

Although the Tanager is now a lab-
oratory publication of the English
dcpnrtmcnt, supported by fees, stu»
dents have been placcd in the major-
ity on thc present staff, with a view
to turning the paper over entirely to
students at the close of the college
The Tanager would thus be-
comc a college, rather than a depart-
mental, vcnturc, would be edited cri—
tircly by students, and would be sup
ported without the aid of fees.

Desired Goul 'i'lmrlen.

The pilﬁiccr Cbcst campaign is still
a thing of the present. Although on.
ly $3153 had been raised last evening
toward the goal or 54300, the commit—
tce expects that later contributions
will raise the total to considerably
more than its present figure.

Building Three was the only unit
among either men or women to axe
ceed its quota, i210 being raised,
while the building's quote. was 3204.
None of the cottages in the mud-
rangle succeeded in going over the
top, although Cottage Four made a
creditable showing. including town
and dormitory studenm and faculty
men, the men of Grinnell raised 11452,
contrasted with an allotment of mud.
The quadrangle, town and faculty
women pledged $1711 of their moo
quota, ,

Cash to the amount of $1163 was
banked by the committee in charge,
Friday afternoon. It was found at
that time that a balance of 345.43 re—
mained from the Pioneer Chest ac—
count of last yeftr. -

After the expenses of the drive have
been deducted, all pledges ranch were
specifically designated for a certain
organization participating in the
drive, will he turned over to that
body, and the remainder wil be pro
rated in the proportion that the Y. M.
C. A., the y, W. C. A., the college
band and Grinnell- .China are stip-
poscd to share in the proceeds.

Expect to liaise More

Further subscriptions over the week
end from strident and instructors who
have not been solicited, and from
alumni and friends of the college, are
expected to swell the total material—
1y, There are about 75 student and
a dozen faculty members who have
not been approached, and they are
particularly requested to lend a help-
ing hand by turning in their subscrip-
tions at once.

Dean Eindlay wishes to express his
gratitude for the faithiul work which
was done by all the solicitors, and
for the co-operation of the editor and
business manager of the Cyclone, who
postponed their own subscription
campaign in order to make way for
the Pioneer Chest.

Have Football Chapel

The series of chapel programs for
the Pioneer Chest came to a close
yesterday whorl a gridgraph was used
to announce the amount of money
raised. The gridgraph was set up on
the chapel platform and a game
closely related to football was played
by the strident and faculty mcn again—
st the student and faculty women.
The game was a scoreless tic through-
out but a touchdown was almost
scored by the faculty men. The women
threatened to score throughout Ike
entire game. ‘ .

The game started off with Smith
hall kicking to Central who received
on the $133.50 line and returned to
$263. A pass was attempted but
Larrgan intercepted and ran for $113.
The ball was punted to Cottage Two
and carried to the $220 line. Consis—
tent holding of opponents forced them
to punt to Building Three who carried
the ball to the $210 mark before he
eing downed. Cottage Three blocked
an attempted kick for $140. Building
Four plunged through the line for
$129 and fumbled. Tbs fumble was
recovered by Cottage Four and al-
most resulted in a touchdown alter
racing $256.

The second quarter started with
Building rive kicking off for $125 to
Cottage Five who returned tor $245.
A forward pass was tried but build-
ing Six intercepted and ran lorSlSD.
Meal-s attempted an end run and net»
ted $205. The ball was given the
faculty men who ran almost the length
or the field for, 5437. The faculty
women gained 3237 and the town men
took the hall and returned for a gain
of six. The half ended with the ball
in possession of the town women on
the 15145 lino.
