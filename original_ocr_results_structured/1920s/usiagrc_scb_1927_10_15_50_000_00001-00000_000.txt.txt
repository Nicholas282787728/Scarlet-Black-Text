ing in the contests.’

cluded a resolution urging the ap-
pointment of the instructor of journal.

Title Contenders
In Action Today

Undefeated Missouri Valley Teams
Will Meet In Attempts to
Keep Standings.

This Saturday's football games in
the Mlssoilri Valley conference will do
much to show the relative strength of
the title contenders. Of the teams
who have played Valley conference
games, Missouri, Washington and Kan.

sas remain undefeated.

Probably the most important
counter on this week's program is the
Missouri-Washington tilt. Missouri, by
virtue of its 7 to s defeat oi Nebraska
rates as the strongest team in the con»
fercnce; While Washington, resenforc-
ed by several brilliant additions from
last year’s freshman class, is not to
be looked on as the underdog that it
formerly was. Last Saturday Wash-
ington defeated the Oklahoma Aggics,
last year’s conference champions.

Kansas Meets Antics

The Kansas University Jayhcwkers
will meet their Aggie rivals in their
usual grudge battle this week-end. The
Aggies lost their first conference en-
countcr to tbc Missouri Tigcrs by the
score of 13 to 6, while Kansas Univer-
sity won from Grinnell in to c. How—
ever, the game promises to bc a strug.
glc from start to finish. as it has
bcen a long time since tile .layhawkcrs
tasted Aggie blood, and the Aggies do
not wish to relinquish tlleil' supreme
acy.

Nebraska entertains Grinuell at
Lincoln, and, though dopc favors the
Cornhuskcrs by n widc margin, up—
scts often occur, especially in the case
of the Huskers. Grinncll has been
spending much time trying to perfect
a passing attack and a surprise might
bc in store for the public who think
it is an impossibility for Grinnell to
defeat Nebraska.

Drake, Oklahoma, Oklahoma A. and
l\l,, and Amos play non-confcrcncc
games this week-end. Drake is host
to the University DE Pittsburg at Des
llioiucs, Plttsburg, with an abundance
of seasoned material,‘should will with-
out much trouble as Drake's team
seemed quite inexperienced against
the Navy. “Gibby" Welch, Duisburg-o
captain and fullback. was one of tho
leading scorers in the country Inst

Watt Believes Grinnell Team Will
Meet Cornhusker Eleven
0n Even Terms.

LEEDTKE IS ONLY CASUALTY

Nebraslm Will Place Aggregation
of National Repute Against
Pioneer Squad.

A large crowd of lusty-voiced in-
dividuals gathered at the rock Island
station Thursday evening to give a
senllaotf to the Pioneer football team.
The scarlet and black machine, which
will meet Nebraska today at Lincoln
departed twenty-two strong with the
full coaching and training squad in at-
tendance. '

Although not harboring many ideas
of handing the Cornbuskers a heavy
dcicat, Coach Watt expressed the he»
lief that his team would fight the heave
ier Nebraska team on foil-1y even
terms. and have an excellent chance
of breaking into the scoring because
of the carolully guarded aerial attack
which the Pioneers are using today,

Squall In Good. Sllnno.

With the exception of Ed Liedtke,
one of the stellar backfield performers
of the Watt aggregation, the complete
squad is in good shape. Licdtkc in-
jured a shoulder in the Kansas game
two weeks ago, and until several days
ago was not conccded a chance to
break into the lineup against the Corn.
huskers. However, the injury proved
to be less than had been expected, and.
the husky Rock island boy is billed to
take his regular berth at right half.

Thornell Barnes, one of the promis-
ing guilrd candidates on the squad, re-
ported for practice Thursday evening
for the first time in two weeks. Barnes
received a severe injury to his knee in
one of the early season scrimmages,
and has been unable to use it to any
appreciable extent since. He will be
in shape for the Drake and Marquette
games according to trainer Chad Let»
ton.

Neill-animus Veterans.

Nebraska will place a veteran team
agsinst Grinnell, and although having
lost to Missouri last week by a 7—8
verdict, the Cornhuskcrs are still rated
as one of the bestieams in tbe middle
west if not in the country. Captain
“Jug” Brown of the Huskers is a very
capable field general, cavortlng at
quarterback on the Berg team. l-lls
forward passing and punting have
been two of the high lights of his
game, and he bas been credited with
being one of the deadliest open-field
tacklers in the conference.

are rated close to maximum in the line
smashing class. Both men rammed
through the Amos and Missouri lines
for big gains on oldrtime plunges, and
only stalwart defenses at the goal
lines by these two teams kept the
liushcr stcam-rollcrs from scoring
much more frequently.

After Chapel.

With the traditional brittle between
Drake and Grinncll as the climax of
the program the big Homecoming,
scheduled to take place Saturday, Oct.
22, will have a variety or other events
lioth before and after the game
planned to interest and rejuvenate the
alumnus from the moment bc bits
town until he reluctantly bids the old
campus not “good»by’.’ but “an rc—
voir." ,

The celebration starts Friday eve«
ning with an all~00llege and all-
community pep-meeting in the and-
itorium of A. R. H. The college band
will play, there will be college songs
and years, There will be some short
speeches by members of the football
squad and others.

' iClIupel In Morning.

After the pep-meeting the Home-
coming play ”Captain Applojack" will
be given at the Colonial.

Saturday morning there will be the
annual Homecoming chapel, with a
speaker from the faculty. When these
Homecoming chapels were started sev-
eral years ago the plan met with scorn
on the part of a few who declared
that no one would go to chapel on
Homecoming day. As things have
turned out the homecoming chapel has
always drnwn the biggest crowd of the
full term. All citizens are welcome at
the homecoming chapel, held at ten
o’clock.

Afterwards there will be a short
pep—meeting in front of the chapel,
and then the crowd ‘ will adjourn to
Ward Field to see two freshman ~foot-
ball teams struggle for the suprem—
acy of 1931. No admission is charged
for the freshman game.

The big game with Drske at half-
past two calls for no comment except
that good Seats are available at the
college office. The office is open from,
9 to 12 and from 1 to 4, except on
Saturday, when it is open from 9 to 12
only. \

Open House After Game.

affairs and openrhouses. in the evel
hing there will bc a Tsurobolium
for the fans and their friends. A col—'
lege dance, Pliilbrick's famous tea.»
room orcbcstra from Des Moines pla ,_
ing will wind up the day.

Several ’details of the program are
unsettled and will be announced later.
A special rate of one " fare for- the
trip will be made by the Rock Island,
good from all points on its lines in
Iowa and a special rate is announced
by the M. a st. L.
