Thinks Intolerance
Marks Present Age

The present age is intolerant rather
than reactionary or revolutionary in
the opinion of Professor Claire. E. Mile
lerd-Smcrtenlm, who talked in chapel
Wednesday morning. she believes that

’ we have a tendency to farm opinions

which are mere preludlccs because we
neglect to study the question from both
sides.

The opposile ol this altitude, a tul-
erauce or indifference is equally prev-
illent and detrimental. The actw‘e
eonlllct of ODInlOnS is the source of
real progress which the more silencing
of those who disagree with us can
n -el accomplish

sum.
