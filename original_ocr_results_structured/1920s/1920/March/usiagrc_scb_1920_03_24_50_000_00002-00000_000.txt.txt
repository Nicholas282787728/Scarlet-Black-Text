In all editorial in Scarlet and Black
for last Saturday “0 quoted one ol
the successors or Webster as deﬁning
culture as “(he enlightenment and dis-
cipline acquired by mental and moral
training" with the addition oi "reﬁne
ment in nianners and‘taste." Beiore
going farther it might he well to point
out that f'memal and moral training"
seems to go back to the distinction
made by Aristotle. He regarded vir-
tue as "a habit oi implying the choice
of excellence in conduct, the excel—
lence being realized in a man between
excess and defect," and divided virtues
into “the moral, having to do with
practical lite and the intellectual, the
virtues of Wisdom and faresight."

Assuming, then, that trneﬁulture is
the aim of students in a liberal arts
coliege and accepting the dictionary
deﬁnition of culture as given above
how can the terms thereol he anniied
to college life?

In [lie ﬁrst place it seems that a.
certain amount of enlightenment or
actual knowledge oi plain iacts is
necessary in the true cultural compo
sition. This eliminates the bluftel‘
and the patrons or protessionai stu-
dents.

The professional student deserves it

ally other odd johs which the student
with more mODEY than brains wishes
to have clone. He is the one who
strikes the most telling biow at this
first fundamental requirement at cul-
ture.

But there is even a more insidious
foe to knowledge. It is the attitude at

The deﬁnition of culture as given
above takes a rap at the old iashioncd

deﬁnition to mean that the cultured

Perhaps a justiﬁcation tor outside
activities in college use can be found
in this point. A college represents
the community in which the student
lives during his college course. The
recognition and acceptance or his du-
ties as a member or that community
are of importance as Well us the gain-
