DISCUSS WORK OF
COLLEGE Y. M. C. A.

Boehmler, Baker, Larsen and Mc-
Donald Are Speakers.

Ronald Boehmler, Herbert Baker,
Ernest Larsen. and Angus McDonald
spoke at the Y. M. c. A. meeting
Thursday evening on the general sub-
Jeet of "The Place or the Y in Grinnell
Life.”

"1‘,th gives a good st'r'ong’push—
the right kind or a push. and you can
depend upon it," was the way Boehm—
ler described the part which the Y
has tsisen in upholding the Grinnell
Spirit, “The Y backed the spirit of
the school all through the io'otball sea—
son, and it is backing the school
spirit all the time," he continued. “The
Y is the type of organization which
is needed to carry out the lien pros
gram—a good clean, strong organiza—
don."

Herbert Baker, in speaking of "The
Place of the Y in Social Lite,"‘said
that very few people realize what
the Y is doing tor the social side or
school lite. Not many people realize
that it is the Y which mess the new
students at the train and introduces
them to the college; and that it is
the Y which is responsible for the
general and other mixes at the begin»
ln'ng or the year.

“The religious duty is 'the primary
duty or the Y here," said Emest har—
sen in speaking or “The Place or the
Y in the Religious Life.” "The Y is

the only thing which helps the lnen‘

develop reel religions feeling and
deeper convictions.
the Y is to call the men aside from
the duties of college life and to im—
press on them the need of a personal
relationship touesus Christ.”

Angus McDonald was the last
speaker, and said that it had been the
purpose oi the Y during the past year
to promotethe religious life of the

Y. W. Votes in Favor
of Los Angeles Plan

By an almost unanimous vote the
Gl'innell College Y. w. c. A. author.
ized its delegate to the national con-
vention which will be held in eleve-
land April 13—20. to vote in iavor of
the Los Angeles Amendment to the
national constitution. This amendment
proposes that each student associa—
tion shall have the right to decide its
own basis ot membership.

The new plan or membership is
based on the desire to be a true fal-
lower of Christ and to be in sympathy
with the purposes oi the organization
as opposed to the old requirement
which demands membership in an
evangelical church. Miss Road pre-

sented the arguments in favor of the

amendment and Rev. E. W. Cross ar-
gued against its adoption, not that he
Was opposed to it but that both sides
might be presented.

Both the Old and New
Have Place Says Noble

“Be Sure that You tolerate the can-
servative and that questions are work—
ed out in fair-minded discussions; be
careful that you do not suddenly
break away from the accumulated
treasure of past days," was the advice
given by Professor Charles Noble at
chapel Wednesday morning in a. dis~
cussion of the conflict between old
and new ideas. Both old and new
have their place, he believes, and we
can be conservatives Without being
mhssbacks. progressives without be—
ing anarchists.
