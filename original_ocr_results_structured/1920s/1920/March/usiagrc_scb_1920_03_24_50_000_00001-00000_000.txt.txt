Grinnell administered a double de-
feat to Coe College in their annual
dllsl debate that was held Saturday
night. The- question discussed was.
"Resolve That Congress Should Eo-
act Legislation Providing For the
Compulsory Arbitration of All Labor
Disputes In rublic Service Corporae
tions." The Gl'inhell negative team
gained a two to one decision over their
opponents in a wellsfought debate.
while their affirmative teammates de-
cisively defeated the Coe affirmative
by a unanimous decision.

The judges for the local debate were
Professor Herbert Goodrich, College
of Law, state University of Iowa; Pro-
fessor J. Van der Zce, Department of
Political Science, smte University of
Iowa; and Mr, J. W. Gemmill, Secree
tary of the state Board of Education,
Des Moines. Professor ,l. P. Ryan pre-
sided as chairman at the local debate.

Cot Puts Up Good right.

The affirmative case was opened by
Richard 0. Roberts and was built up
and defended by Harold E. Skinner
and Owen r. Rail. The Coe men but
up a good ﬁght and were well received
by the audience.

Harry Barnes opened the contest
for the negative and was followed by
Linn Smith and Ronald Boehmler. In
the rebuttais, Barnes spoke ﬁrst, with
Boehmler second, and Smith last. The
most exciting moments of the debate
were at this time when Smith and Rail
mixed in their concluding speeches.

The affirmative team that represents
ed Crinnell at Cedar Rapids was Jo»
scph Kelly, John Bartlett, 'snd Mason
Ladd. All did good work, as shown
by the outcome of the debate.

to her past and conﬁdent of her future,

Professor L. P. Sherman iu chapel
Monday morning in urging a greater
loyarty and sense of solidarity among
the student bcdvi particularly among
the men.

Professor Sherman believes that a

tablished here, but that the men's
,collegc lacks the proper development.
He is conﬁdent that the Men’s Union
and a new Men’s Gymnasium which
are planned will do much to aid the
situation, but suggested in addition
that we need more songs, more cheers,
more loyal participation and support
of student activities and a better
chapel attendance in developing a real
college spirit among the men. He
referred to “Sons of-Old Grihnell" as
the “Star Spangled Banner" of the col-
lege, excellent of its kind but not
suited for all occasions, and told of
the influence which class»singing had
in his undergraduate days at Dart-
,mouth. Professor Sher-man believes
that chapel is the real unifying force
of the college and that a full attend-
ance would make it genuinely effec-
tive. In reference to the support of
activities, he paid tribute to the de-
bate te‘ams and urged that they be ac-
corded the same hacking as that given
our athletic teams.

LEBERT PUBLISHES
FRENCH TEXT BOOK

the year, have published, as a French
conversation and composition book, a
group of short stories and anecdotes
of American college life. He has col—
lectcd these from his personal experi-
ences in American colleges.

The book will furnish a pleasant
method of acquiring a vocabulary for
most of the circumstances in American
student life. Prof, Lebcrt thinks the
student himself. is the most interest-
ing factor in the American college and
so he is the center of the stories.

One of Professor Lehert‘s French
composition classes is using these
stories for class work. A. chance was
also given the class members to con~
tribute anecdotes from their own ex»
perience, to be used in this book.

Discusses Problem _
0f Individualism

HOW to make possible .1 common life
in‘harmony with our idea of the su-
premacy of the individual soul is the
great social problem of today, accords
lng to Professor J. D. Stoops who
talked upon the subject at Vespers
Sunday afternoon. He believes that
it is clear that individualism carried
out internationally will mean the des-
truction of civilization, and that we
are just beginning to realize that the
same is true of our life within the na—
tion.

Our failure to solve this problem

ion, as the failure to fit in fndivdual
life with a society founded on group
and tribal tradition caused the scat—
tering of the Hebrew race, Our tr»
dltlons for over a. Lhousztnr] years have
taught the supremacy of the indi-
vidual, while the Hebrews had the
iden of individual subordination to the
group. The harmony of the two is
the necessary key to lasting progress.

NEED MORE INTEREST
IN GAMWEAUTIFUL

Weirick Suggests Flag Staff Anfl
Memorial Gate as Needed
Improvements.

"What the students of Crinnell Col»
leeg need more than anything else is
a keeper realization that whatever
they do to beautify their campus or
their quadrangle and dormitories is
for themselves as much as for their
School," declared Ray F. Weirick of
,Des Moincs, consulting landscape
architect for the college, in an inter-
view Thursday.

Mr. Weirick has six ,other schools
like Gi‘innell to Care for as regardsv
their campus plan—the laying out of
walks, the placing of the various col—
liege units, the planting of trees and
'the like.

“Gl‘innell is midway between the‘
small school and the university, so
there is a spirit of selfsccntel'edness.
of indifference toward such things,
‘ that must be overcome." AL Penn COL
liege the students and faculty are more
1of a big family and here they take a
’genuine interest in. beautifying the
lgl‘ounds. Memorials of various kinds
have been erected or are being plan-
‘ned and the students have given inval—
\uable aid in suggesting persons among
gthe'ir acquaintances who would give,
‘ﬁnancial aid to the college in realizing,
these plans.

"Most people think they are wasting
,their money by spending it for land—
lscape gardening," said Mr. Weirlck,
l"hut the results are there. The col<
i’lege is handicapped for lack of funds

the men's dormitories should also be

Staging is Feature —
Acting of High Qual-
ity Throughout.

The venture into the realm of the

tempted by the Chl‘csierllis societies

which was large enough to allow the

business manager to enjoy the plays
with an easy mind.

Taken as a whole the evening’s en-
tertainment was an entire success and
if the few crudities Which are the in-
evitable accompaniment of amateur
productions can be shoved far enough
into the background it stands forth as
a dramatic triumph of more than usual
merit.

Some of the outstanding stars of
[hr evening never appeared upon the
stage While the curtain was up. They
were the stage managers and their
capable as istahts who were the origi—
nators of the sets used in all three
plays. The aim of the societies as
before expressed of effecting 8. Com-
promise between realism and symbol-
ism in stage settings was most suc-

‘cesslullv realized. This was especially

noticeable in the ﬁrst two plays [iro-
sentcd, namely "The Neighbors" and
“Suppressed Desires." However, the
cue for applause for the stage mana-
ger came with the tWo scenes of "King
Argimenes and the Unknown War-
riol'." In this play responsibility for
dramatic interest rested about equally
on acting and stage effects and the
actors should share the laurel wreath
of success with those who labored to
produce the settings.

Although the staging was excellent
the actors were more than worthy of
the scenery. ”The Neighbors,” a

Detective Discovers
Dope on Delivery
of Malteasern

(By the staff detective).
Yesterday morning I found the fol-
lowing assignment from the editor
when I reported at the office:—Pe0—
ple impatient over dalay of Malteaser.
Find out when it will be out.

So I got busy. I interviewed the
editor who as usual said that it would
not be long‘and I could get nothing
more satisfactory from other Sigma
Delta Chi members. I concluded that
my only hope was to go to the print.
ing office and sec for myself.

Late at light I letmysclf through one
of the back windows and flashlight in
hand began my midnight prowlings.
But what I found rewarded the for my
trouble. In the basement I found
the covers all printed, ready to be
stapled to the magazine itself. Up~
stairs I found page proofs of nearly
the entire magazine and spent most
of the night perusing the contents
thereof. It is not part of my lob to
say this but I spent a most enjoyable
night If I know anything about
printing I would say that Friday night
should see "The Malteaser" in the
hands of its subscribers. How‘s that,

 

Mr, Editor?
