tor appendicitis at the Community
Hospital Saturday spent a very good
night last night considering his seri»

Err-Pres. Bradley
Offers Rare Trees‘

Ex~Presidcnt Bradley, lormcrly or
Griilncll College, has written to Pror,‘
H. SuConard expressing his continued
interest in the College and offering
to present to the College some rare
young trees.

Dr. Bradley was the immediate pres
decessor of President Main, and was
responsible tor the planting of the
young trees now nourishing on the
campus. At present, he is head of a
large institutional church in Cleve‘
land.

Their program included selections
trom the classical composers, as well
as introducing a work by Braudts—
Buy-s. a new writer. The Mozart
“D minor Quartet” showed the genuiuc
ability or the ensemble, particularly in
[the slow movement, which was mark.
red'hy precision oi bowing. tone color,
and sympathetic expression. Another
popular numbor was the "Nocturne"
from the "o ai-tet No. 2" by Borodinc.
‘In this the melodic thomc introduced
as a 'c‘olio solo was taken up by the
lam violin and carried through the
entire quartct.

Tho “Romantic Serenade" by
was expressive and i —
teresting in its treatment. The mod.
crn intorcst in Indian music was
shown in the “Sunrise Song" by skil—
tou, which was based on an Indian
theme. The far-away, flute—like bar.
lnonics which opened the number gave
,thc atliiosphere ot the entire piece.
lTbe “Serenade" by I-layrln has already
been made popular here by the Grin—
ilell string Quartet.

string quartet music makes the
most complcto and portcot form of
chamber mu 'c; the parts are separ—
ate and distinct, yet blend into one
another. The Zoellners are masters
of this form of musical expression.

Grinnell Purposes
Discussed by Ryan

Dwelling on the early history or the
college, Professor 3‘. P. Ryan empha—
sized the distinctive nature of the in-
stitution in Chapel Tuesday morning.
He Quoted Grinnell’s motto, "Christa
Duce," as being indicative or the aim
of the founder,
lish a Christian institution imbued
with the so it of service, in the effort
to appropriate and spread the spirit
0: Ch! t. The founders also planned
that ormnurll sliouldbc aliheral insti-
tution, setting the individual free to
work in whatever ﬁeltl he may choose.
Prnlessor Ryan urged a better under—
standing of these purposes, adding
that "the individual vision not in
harmony with an institution and its
traditions usually fails."

Is Urged by Norris

That the Student best serves who

influence his after life. In support-
ing the Doc tv of individual action.
Professor Norris stated that, in his
opinion. combined action or student
self-government did not work out in
practice.
