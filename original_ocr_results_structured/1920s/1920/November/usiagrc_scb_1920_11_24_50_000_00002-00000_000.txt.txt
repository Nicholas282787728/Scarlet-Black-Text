MARTHA WASHINGTON
DOWN

Cornell, in a conterencc at Mount
‘Vei'non last Saturday. It was agreed
'to let Carleton decide the question
.and also the teams that will make
the trips away from their schools.

As Carleton is using the question
,"Resolved: That the Cummins-Esch’
:blll should be repealed" in one of
their debates outside the triangular,
. t is entirely probable that this will‘
lbe the question submitted by them.
ins soon as a reply is received from
'Carleton new contracts will be drawn
up containing‘the new wording of the
question and the provisions as to
which teams shall travel, and these
will be signed by thevthree schools. 1

Argue March 11

March 11 is the date decided upon
for the triangular debate and the de-l
bate with Cos will he one week ear-l
licr, March 4. The wording of the
question for debate with one, which‘
will he on some phase of the lmmi»
gratihn question, has not yet been de»
cided upon by Coe.

The probable rewording of the
question on the Cummins-Esch bill
will be used in the intel'soclety ﬂe—
bates which will be held Dec. 8-9.
