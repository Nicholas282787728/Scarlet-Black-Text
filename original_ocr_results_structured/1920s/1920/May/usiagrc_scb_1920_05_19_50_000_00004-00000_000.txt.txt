lowed the Latin text or the liturgi
closely, the English text being a free
translation nutintaining the spirit or
the original. The anciem Requiem
has us its distinctive feature the an—
cient Latin hymn, ascribcd to Thomas
F, Celann, the iricnd and biographer
of st. Francis ot Asslssi, known as r:
the Dies Irae—Duy of vengeance, day
or mourning, see fulﬁlled the prophc s
wurning, heaven and earth to Miles '

most terrible hymns tlmt medieval
thcology has bequeathed to the mod- _
crn world. Aiter portraying the lust 1,

pious soul, and its reliance on divine
grace rot par-don end salvation from .
the everlasting tires. 1'
Frofessor Scheve‘s genius as sin or
chestral and choral writer have been '
riven by many works of magnitude.
At previous festivals the great orator-lo
of the Death and Resurrection, a sym .
phony, and a. piano concerto, all his,
original Works. have been presented,
with complete success, and as time gies
on an increasing recognition is being
awarded his music. The Song oi Peni-
tence is n heautliul work in every re—‘
spect. its writing, both tor the solo
voices and the chorus, is completely
cucctive, and the orchestration is
vivid and appropriate, such as only a
skilled master of this dmicult crtl
could produce. ' |
1 At the drst performance of the son
of Penitence, in 1915, Walter Dam
risch, the eminent conductor of thei
New Yul-k symphony Orchestra, was a
very much interested listener. After
the performance Mr. mmrosch prais—
ed the Work in the following terms:
“1 11m both astonished and delighted
at meeting in Grinnell a composer and
conductor of the charscter a. n d
strength oi Professor Scbcvc. His
"song of. Penitence" is written in the
best ecclesiastical stylc, wiﬂ1 passages
of great tenderness and reii 'ous feelr
ing. The orchestration is rich—sand
written by one who understands thorr
oughly the nature oi the orchestra.
As a conductor. Frofessor Scheme >
shows the skill and exnm'ienco or mic ;
who is thoroughly ct home in hand.

tered complcicly into the spirit of tho 1
work, so much in contrast to the old
dry as— —dust or'ttollos that we frcl
nucutly have to ncriorm. and we wet
all delighted to have a part in th.
initial production."
