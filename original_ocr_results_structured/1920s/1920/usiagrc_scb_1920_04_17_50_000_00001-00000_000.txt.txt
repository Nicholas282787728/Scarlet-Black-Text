loped Dormitory Four 12 to 2. Wed-
nesday Dormitory Six nosed out Dor-
mitory Five by a seventh inning hat-
ting rally, and won that contest A to 3.
A couple of rniseues by the One dorm-l
.itcs permitted Dormitory Two to winl
by a 4 to 3 Count Friday afternoon.
Tile league schedule calls 'for three
seven-inning games a week, preferably
Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays,
leaving the balance of the week for
practice and the playing of postponed
games. The present schedule contin-
ues up to and through the week of
May 10, each building playing the
other buildings once, By arranging
more than three games a week for the
balance of the semester, 3. second

Several ineligiblllties which devel~

oped in the eleventh hour, coupled,

with the absence of Karl llass, have

upset the dope so completely that little I

can lie foretold as to the result of the
annual homo lncct being held on Ward
ﬁeld this afternoon. No class has an
edge on its competitors, and the large
number of dark horses entered in the
various races makes the Icsult of the
meet extremely uncertain.

Karl Iiass, track captain for tiris’mng'

year, who was married last week, is

' ting at his hours and consequently
w 1 not compete today. His future
mans are uncertain, but it is possible
that he vill return to Grinnell in time
to par pate in the Drake relays next
Saturday. . .

should the weather clear up, it is
probable that scvcral new records
will be set, despite the poor condition
of the track. These records will prob
ably come in the distances or the ﬁeld
events.

Points are to be awarded for four
places which will give the classes
lacking in particular stars a chance
to cop enollgh- seconds, thirds and
tour-tbs to win the contest. Guy Nich-
ols of Grinnell high school will act
as starter.

STRING QUART ET IN

a unity of purpose and conception
which made a harmonious and Well-
halanced ensemble.

The Beethoven Quartct was marked
by beauty and variety of tone shade
ing, the scherzo being especially well
worked out.

Two of the numbers were composi.
tions of Prof. Elias Hlnm, of the
School 0!: Music. His “Romanza” was
played with ﬁne expression, and the
unusual “Andantinu” by Debussy,
played with muted strings, was very
effective. The two movements from
the Bocc’herini Quartet. with their at»
tractlve themes, were greatly enjoyed
by the audience. Two encorcs were
insisted upon.
insisted upon, "Molly 0n the Shore,"
en ararngement of an old Irish reel,

Tne Grinnell String Quartet has
made a place for itself in the musical
circles of the Middle West, and stands
out as an organization upholdlng the
highest type of music. The members
ship has been unchanged for five
years, giving opportunity for the player

ing andvsympatny with each other in
their work. Grinnell's quartet is one
of the distinctive features in her mn—
sical life.
