PRAISE [lF CHIiIbS

Symbolic Play Scores Success in
Presentation Under Amateur
Direction.

lly ohm-latte u‘liitt-liill, ”21‘

The “Pageant. oi Pilgrims" given at
the Congregational church Sunday and
Monday evenings was an unusually
tine presentation. it was regarded as
a complete artistic success, comparing
very iavoi-ahly with its presentation
at Municipal Pier, Chicago, last sum-
mer. The occasion of giving the page
ant was the tcrcenteuary celebration
oi the landing of the Pilgrims.

The thread oi the story follous the
decision at the Pilgrims to leave Eng-
land, their iouiney to America, the
rounding oi the colony at Flymoutli,
and the coming oi the good ship For-
tune, on Thanksgiving day.

Symbolic Ports Good

The symbolic parts were especially
good. They included the storm on the
ocean, lollowcd by the rain, then the
sun and the rainbow; the coming of
cold and iamino to the toiling pil-
girins, and the coming of Faith; and
last the spirit oi Adventure beckon-
ing the people oi all nations west—
ward to iind liberty The iinal scene
shows the Diaries): and the people oi
other nations gathered about the spii-L
it oi the church and the Goddess of
Liberty.

The lighting and the costuniing
played a large part in the eiieciive
ncss oi the pageant. One very good
scene was the council scene when the
Red Men and the Pilgrims gathered
about the council the to sinolic the
pipe oi peace. Another was the storm
scene.

The questioner and the interpreter
established the continuity oi the en
sodcs, interpreting each one in its
bearing upon the more

The parts were all exceptionally
well east and well taken, much [31'0an
ising liistrionic talent being shown.
