A college is the laboratory oi life.
We are supposed to learn how to live;
and to learn how to live, means to
learn how‘ to tackle life's problcms and
how to master thcin. A college man
who tells to accomplish this purpose
while in college, tails in the years
after he leaves college. To such a
man the criticising puhlic points a, ﬁn-
ger of scorn and derision, and adds
another reason why young men should
not “waste their time” in college.

There spoke in Gl'lnrlell one day
last week, a man who is a candidate
tor the governorship nomination at the
next election. Announcement was
made to the men at the dormitories
and it was expected that many or
them, and especially those or voting
age, would avail themselves of the op-
portunlty of hearing ‘the candidate.
HOW many did’! There were exactly
ﬁve college men there, Only ﬁve of
the one hundred voters in this school.
Only ﬁve‘who were interested enough,
in the great political game or this
state, to listen to the words or a lead-
ing citizen aspiring tor the highest
political honors we can give him in
Iowa. ,

There are approximately four hun-
dred men in college. It is safe to say
that at least one-fourth of these men
