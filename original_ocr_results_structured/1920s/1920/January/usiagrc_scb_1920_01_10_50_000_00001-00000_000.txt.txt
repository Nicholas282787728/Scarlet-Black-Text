. WITH DES MllINESl
Y FIVE TONIGHT

F o r m e r Grinnellians
Among Invaders—Gee
Game Scheduled.

Playing a quintet composed largely
of former Grinnell basket stars, the
Pioneers will battle the Des Moines
Y. M. c. A. ﬁve in the second game
of the season in the Mens Gymnas~
ium tonight. The contest is scheduled
to begin at eight o'clock, despite other
events which may he on the college
calendar.

The Y. M. C. A, team has been play-
ing basketball for more than a month
and hence are in 'midrsedson shape,
The contest this evening will he the
ﬁrst battle between the two lives in
a number of years. ~Until a year or
so before the war, the “Y” team ap-
peared on the Grinnell schedule reg-
ularly, and every game between the
rival quintets has been bitterly cone
tested. .

Add Game With Coo.

According to the way the squad has
been lining up in scrimmage this week
the probable lineup for the game Will
be Evans and Shossmith, forwardsn
Vinsel, center; Winter and Wassanar.
guards. Miller. who started the Penn
game at forward, has been greatly
hampered by an injury to his ankle
received in the CornenLcrinnell ioot-'
ball contest last fall.

Negotiations were closed today with
Coc for a basket game on thc Ficneer
court the night or January 23. This
brings the total number of games on
the season's schedule up to ﬁfteen,
and one in two more may be added
before the end of the winter.

Is First Itcal Test.

The game tonight will be the ﬁrst
real test of the strength of the Pioneer
aggregation, as the teamwork of the
Penn quintet was too weal! to en-
able the Scarlet and Black fans to
judge the offensive power of the Grin—
nell team, Winter and Wassenar, with
a year of previous varsity work, have
proven to be as good a pair of guards
as will be seen in the state this year.
and it the team is able to develop suf-
ﬁcient offensive power, Grinnell
should have one of the most success—
ful seasons in years.

Several Opera Numbers Featured
In Pleasing Concert by Fac-
ulty Members,

The recital of vocal duets by Miss
Jean Currie and Professor Elias Elum
given in Herrick Chapel last night
was such as to make orinnell
proud to claim them as members of
her School of Music faculty. Their
hearers were delighted by the artistry
of the performance.

The outstanding number on their
program was "Ii se falt tard" from
“Faust." It showed ﬁneness of inter—
pretation and ﬁnish in its execution
Another number which the audience
enjoyed was the "Gondoliera." by Hen—
schel, which was marked by the char—
acteristic hoatsong rhythm. "Home to
Our Mountains” from “11 Trovatiore,”
which was sung as an encore, was
beautiful in its tone shading and ex-
pression.

The voices of Miss Currie and Mr.
Blum are particularly well suited for
duct work. as they blend and harmon-
ize. Smoothness and flexibility ‘char-
acterize both.

The accompaniments by Alma miner
Fierce were an addition to the success
of the recital.

Urge Wider Use of
Books and Journals

A wider use of the growing ﬂood
01' books and journals and a wider
spread of good books and journals—
thesc arc the tasks that the members
of the American Library Association.
have put before themselves—according
to data given out by Miss Isabel Clark
acting Librarian of Grinneli College.
who attended the recent convention of
organized librarians held in Chicago.

The Association also plans to pub-
lish and encourage the publication of
books printed in the new Graille type
for blind sailors, soldiers and mar-
ines. They aim to (Jo-operate with
the government departments in pro-
moting library aflalrs and the use of
library books.

MARGEHY WARNER in
INDIA ungiucml

Will Be Instructor in Music in
Kodaikanal School For Mis-
sionaries’ Children.

Miss Margery Warner has just re-
ceived deﬁnite word of her appoint.
ment as instructor or music in the
Kodaikanal School for Missionaries
Children at Kodaikanal, South India.
She has been in correspondcnce with
the American Board since the posi—
tion was ottcred her last August and
has decided to accept the offer under
a three year contract.

The Kodailranal School was founded
nineteen years ago tor the purpose
of educating the children of Missionv
arics at a point within easy reach of
their parents, thus doing away with
the painful necessity or an early sep-
aration. The children enter the school
at about seven years of age and re-
main until the ﬁfteenth year. Vaca
tion periods are spent with their pare
cnts. The school is standardized ac—
cording to the curriculum of the min-
ois public schools and pupils from it
are accepted by colleges in the United
states and England.

Last week Mrs. A. s. Wilson, wife
of the principal of this school, spent
a day here with Miss Warner on her
way to the Student Volunteer Con-
vention in Des Moines. She has been
in India for 23 years and gave much
interesting information about the
school and its location. ,

The position calls ior as prompt a
response as is possible and Miss War-
ner will plan to leave some time in
the spring. The exact date of sailing
cannot be detemined at this time.

Miss Warner is unusually gifted as
a musician. During college days she
was one of the favorite college soloists
and a prominent member of the Girls'
Glee Club and since graduation she
has remained in Griunell as librarian
of the School ofMusic. She has been
a prominent member also of the Con—
gregational church choir and a favor—
ite soloist there. She is admirably
qualiﬁed for the duties which she will
undertake and a great many friends
are confident that she will do splendid
work in this new capacity.

Start Boys Right
Says Doctor Kinzer

"It is better to start the boy out
right at the beginning, than to reform

him at the other end.” says Dr. W. R.
Kinzer, city Scout Master, in his talk
at Y, M. C. A. Thursday night. He
considers that the time to get hold of
a boy is When he is at the age of
from thirteen to ﬁfteen years, and
that the Boy Scout club is the best
means of starting him out right.

The main purpose of his talk to the
Y. M. C. A. was to get the college men
interested enough in the Boy Scout
movement to help take charge of Scout
patrols which the youths of Grinnell
are eager to organize, but are pre-
vented for lack of patrol masters. It
is on account of this scarcity of men
to look after the Scouts. that the
Work is not yet very well organized
in Grime“,

He believes that there is a big fu~
ture for college trained men interested
in the Work of organizing and taking
charge of Scout patrols. He predicts
that by the middle of February there
will be twelve to ﬁfteen towns in the
state wanting competent Scout execu-
tives and will pay as high as $3,000

 

.a year for their services.
