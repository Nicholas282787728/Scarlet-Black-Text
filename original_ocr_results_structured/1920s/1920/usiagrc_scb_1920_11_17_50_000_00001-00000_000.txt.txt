Professor H. W. Matlacl: was
awarded the Henry York Steiner
memorial prize at chapel Monday, folr
lowing the Singing of his new song,
"Here Come the Pioneers", the words
to which are given on Page 4,

Both the words and the music to
the song were written by Prof. Mat-
lack. Though of no exquisite style
there is a swing to the verse that
makes it pleasing especially when
connected with the fine march tune.
The song is just what has been needed
in the college as a pep song of a less
dignified nature than the rest of the
recognized songs.

The Henry York Steiner memorial
prize was established in 1912 by Prof.
E, A. Steiner as a memorial to his

is awarded annually for the promo-
tion of creative art, the prize for 1920
being awarded for a campus song and
music.

LUTHER BUHBANK MAN
lS PUPWEBTURE

Henry A. Adrian Urges Need for
Research In First Number
Of Lecture Course,

Henry A, Adrian, “The Luther B‘ll‘
bank man." lectured Saturday night,
in He ~rck chapel, on Burbauk's grca
work in the fields of botany and 50k
iellce. Mr. Adrian's lecture was the
opening number on the college lecture
course. and is the first of a series or
addresses on subjects of general in—
terest to the students and townspeo-
ple of Grinnell.

Mr. Ad an presented a plea [or
more investigations in the botaunical
field. “Plants are what they are he-
Icause of [our things," he said. "These
[are biology of habit, environment, ac~
cident, or man’s influence. Nothing
can stand still, It must go up or down,
We must breed more into plants and
iniust breed the undesirable out of
them, We have got to mix our brains
with the soil."

Speaking of the tremendous seri-
ousness of the food problem that is
now and will continue confronting us,
he said: “We cannot afford to let any-
thing go to waste or get below its
highest productivity. The time is
coming when he who does not work
shall not eat. We have got to do
something in America to lead our
boys and gi ~ s back to the farm."

W. C. McLarcn of the class or ’98,
was recently elected president or the
Washington state bar association. His
home is how in Seattle, but ire was
formerly an Iowan.

FAMOUS READER WILL

Drinkwater‘s Great Epic,
“Abraham Lincoln.’ ’

Miss Hortense hiclseii, commonly
known as America's foremost imperr
sonator. will appear at the Congrega-
tional Church, Friday night, in John
Drinkwater great success, “Abra-
ham Lincoln. The play is a brilliant
aiid dignified one and seems destined
to take a permanent place in Ameri-
can literature, because never before
have such vividly American times
been depicted in such a. drama.

Critics, in discussing the work of
Miss Nielsen have pronounced her to
be axle of the greatest dramatic read

Nielsen has been touring the country
in this role, and has been universally
hopular at the schools where she has
appeared. A short time ago, she was
at Coc and Cornell and comes here
from a tour of Drake and other
schools,

“Abraham Lincoln”, as depicted by
John Drinkrrater, is a drama com—
pletely worthy of its title and of its
theme, says Charles Collins in the
Chicago Post, Drinkwater turns hack
ranging his material with an artistry
unexcelled, resulting in the renewal
in miiiric action, of the tragedy of oirr
Civil War—illuminated by the inspir-

 

Vrigiiiia Merz, Hazel stockdale. Mabell
Brawn nears, Madge Meredith, Altha
Hawkins, Geraldine Kern; Cottage V,‘
Doris Smith, Winifred Fritz, Charlotte
Anderson; Coiitral, Eleanor Gurver,

‘Clnl'a Easter. Agnes Glcisteill.

Nothing that the
stage has to offer, even in its supreme
classics, possr ses dcopor significance
and higher sp rial appeal to Ameri-
can audiences than this dramatization
of the presidential career- of the
Emancipntor.”

A number of impromptu tours for
and against an amendment were made
lby various girls. Those not in favor
of the amendment said that in having
‘Suiiday dates We would be doing away
with the one thing that makes Grin-
diell distinctive, and furthermore that
Sunday is the only day that the girls
have to be by themselves.

It we are to maintain a woman’s
college and a man's college in a co-
educational institution Sunday is the
,only day when complete freedom in
our separate lives can be developed.
on the other hand those in favor of
the amendment said that since we all
agreed that there was no harm in
Sunday dates why not let those who
want them have them.

In accordance with a [acuity recom-
inendatioii made last year only those
girls who have been here at least one
year will have their votes counted in
full. All other votes will eoimt one

Teachers Committee
Gives Annual Report

The committee on recommendations
for Grinnell graduates and undergrad—
notes for teaching positions has re-
Cently presented a report for the year
ending Nov. 15, 192D. This report
,shows that 32% of the elections se-
cured by the 124 people filling out
registration blanks were secured by
the recommendations of this commit-
tee. It is estimated that the work
.done by this committee saves pros-
pective Grinncll teachers sdouo auuue
ally in agency fees. To Professor L.
D. Hartson is due the credit for the
excellent service offered Grinirellians
in securing teaching positions,
