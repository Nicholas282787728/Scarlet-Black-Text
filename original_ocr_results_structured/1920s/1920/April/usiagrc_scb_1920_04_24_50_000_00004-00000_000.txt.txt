Are College Men and Women interested in deepe ning: .

. RESPECT FOR THE HOME?
Jesus of Nazareth found Women slaves He made them companions. Down through the ages His
Church has been the champion of women s righ ts and aspi1 ations; the bulwark of the Christian home.

RESPECT FOR THE MAN WHO WORKS? ° ‘ .
It was the Carpenter of Nazareth who gave lab or its great charter. “You are sons of God," He sald.
In that sentence Democracy was born.

RESPECT FOR PROPERTY?
Modern business is credit; and credit is character.
up 1n respect for law that religion breeds.

RESPECT FOR EDUCATION?

Who gave America her colleges? They were f ounded by Christian Ministers, almost all of them.
ON THESE GR EAT FUNDAMENTALS must we build abetter Amelica and a better world. And every one
of them rests on the foundations of the Christian Church.

WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO? WHY NOT MAKE A CONTRIBU-
TION TO YOUR HOME CHURCH OR TO ONE OF THE GRIN-
NELL CHURCHES?
