NIOHOLSON IS ORAOOEO
BEFORE BOARO

At a special meeting of the League
Board Monday night deﬁnite action
was taken on the circulated rumor that

iliss Nicholson had been guilty at haw
mg more than one lockout at dinner.
Miss Nicholson was called up bcfore
the board to be cross-examined. After
a futile effort on the part of President
Besser to gain a confession from the
defendant, Miss Lowden, the Board's
cbiet witness, was called in. Miss
Nicholson was noticed tc wince at the
sight of the witness.

Miss Lou-den stated that twice to
her knowledge Miss Nicholson had
been late to dinner.

The Board was paralyzed to hear
this indictment but its truth was con-
ﬁrmed when Miss Nicholson sank in a
crumpled heap on the carpet, exclaim-
ing in her anguish "‘It's true, all too
true."

Because of the hunibleness of the
culprit the Board decided only to suSA
pend all campus privileges, which will
include all dances. during the spring
term.

BASKETBALL DEBATE ENBS
IN GENERAL RIOT.

An attempt was made to decide the

girls' basketball championship in a
triangular debate between the Juniors,
Sophomores and Freshmen in the an-
ditorium of A. lit. H. last night. Each
team upheld the question: “Resolved,
That We Won the Basketball Series."
Lois White, Ruth Condoo. and Irma.
Scofield debated for the Juniors. Mire
lam Carpenter, Helen Foster, and
Clarissa Evenson for the Sophomores,
and Ruth Serline. Agnes Todd. and
Clarisse Savage for the Freshmen.

The judges for the debate were Prof.
Joseph Walleser, Prof. L. p. Sherman
and Mr. Carl Compton. Mason Ladd
acted as chairman. Other individuals
were: Referee, Miss Zimmerman:
Head linesman, Mr. Matlack; and
Time-keeper, Prof. Johnson.
- The Juniors ﬁrst presented their ar-
guments, which were, briefly, that on
account of their dignity as the most
advanced class of the three that be-
cause they were in more activities, and
that because of the urgent social en-
gagements which prevented Agnes st.
John's playing in the evening, the de-
cision should be given to them. The
first argument was the most telling.
although the last carried considerable
weight.

The Freshmen contended that they
had shown the most interest in having
more girls out for basket hall and that

they had the best looking team.e To..

this the Sophomores took exception,
claiming that the Freshmen had lifted
one of their arguments. Their fur-
ther argument was that they had won
the championship last year, and therer
fo e should have it again.

It the rebuttal time was gained by
all three teams talking at once.

The meeting ended in a riot, making
any decision impossible.
