The League is composed of thirty
European national societies under the
leadership or Henry F. Davison, lol-

ditions and developing Red Cross nu.»

sent to Omaha-Slovakia and made d1-
rector of the Department of Organize
tion, which position he held for five
months. His work was to organize
the national society along the lines at
the merican Red Cross, and to out-
line al peace program for a permanent
and extensive work.

A number of new features are to be
embodied in this year's issue. accor-
ding to James Findlay. editor,
there will be at least three distinctly
new features. In addition, there will
be a new type of color scheme that
is being worked out by Robert Bud-
long, and Belle Scott, art editors. The
art-work will be an innovation in type
and quantity and should, alone, prove
a great attracnon to the students.
There is also a possibility that the
size of the annual may be changed in
order to make it completely distinc-
tive in size as well as in content.
