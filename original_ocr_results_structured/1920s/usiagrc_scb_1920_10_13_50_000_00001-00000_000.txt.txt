slight shakeups in the Pioneer line
up have been made necessan’ this
week in preparation for the Washing-
ton battle. Saturday. Members or the
team have not. recovered 1mm. injuries
incurred in the Andes battle.

A prospective view or the game last
Saturday shows that Ames had clear-
ly the better team oi the two and de-
served to win, but that the tinal score
was no indication of the merits ot
the two elevens. The iirst touchdown
was a matter or pure luck. Fearing
mulied a kick near his own goal, the
ball rolling over the line, where an
Ames back tell on it. The second
counter Amos really earned, for the
Aggies carrieihihe ball in scrimmage
from the center or the hold.

Tlllrll Score Fluke

The third score was another ﬂuke.
A bad pass got by Markiey, who ran
after it, picked it up behind his own
goal line, and made a heroic ettort to
kick. He actually got the ball away
and live yards out in the lield oi plity
where it rolled into the arms or an
Andes iorward who was standing
alone twenty yards away irom the
play. Ames again earned the fourth
touchdown on three successive 20-yard
forward passes. Amos won and ties
served to win, but the score which
she piled up was the result oi llcz- re
ceiving the breaks or the game.

Dwight Macy, a substitute hali, has
been drilled considerably at quarter--
back this week, as hearing has been
sutlcring from on injured root. Capt.
Don Parker has also not been able to
appear in the lineup as a result oi
innnries received Saturday, but it is
expected that he will be able to start
against the st. Louis aggregation.
Several others are nursing had bruises
and charlcy horses,

Little inlcrmation is available here
concerning this year's Washington
eleven save that Conzclman, star back,
was declared ineligible early this
week. A_good numhcr oi letter men
are back at the St, Louis school, how-
ever, and a strong team is expected
to represent them on Word lield sat—
urday.

Science Club Plans
Program For Season

Work for the yeztr was outlined by
the Science club at a inccting held
Monday evening. it was dccidcd to
make the meetings oi a more intercst-
ing, and less technical nature, and to
invite non members interested in the
work or the club to attend.

It is hoped that out of town speak—
ers may be obtained ior various occa-
sions during ‘the year, and that a
large attendance oi local scientifically
inclined people can be encouraged, ac-
cording to club members. social, pro.
,gram, and publicity committees wcvc

‘GX'IDTIETI. Alumnus Describes Piti—

Of War Times.

lllajor A. C. Lyons, knou—n in Grill-
nell as “Tad" Lyons, who returned to
Crirmell tho middlc oi July attcr iii-
teen months at service in Siberia with
the American Red Cross, hits interest‘
ing comment to make on the critical
situation in Russia and Siberia. Mas
jor Lyons graduated from Grinnell
Collcgc in 1394, and is a Harvard Law
graduate. He has been a. trustee or
Grinnell tor the past eight or ten
years. He was connected with the
American Red Cross for about two
years, serving at lirst with the Gulf
Division and the last iiiteen months
in military rcliel work in Siberia,

“Siberia is a country or wonderiul
natural resources a: agriculture, for-
csts, grazing land, and mining," ac,
cording to Major Lyons. “Many
American army people are remain-
ing there to take adv-antage oi the op—
portunities which will present them—
selves as soon as a settled state or
government is arrived at. But at pres-
ent this great country is in chaos
without any government."

reared Kolcluui rower

At one time, according to Major
Lyons, it looked very much as though
Kolchak government would eventuelr
ly come into power. "But in Febru-
ary, General Kolchak, an aristocrat.
was killed, which brought to an end
possibilities tor settlement in that di-
rection, There were at one time four
hundred Americans engaged in Red
Cross work in Siberia. Major Lyons
was in the Military Reliei ser ice as-
sisting the troops which remained in
Siberia, and helping the prisoners of
war to get into communication with
their tamilies, oi these four hundred
workers there are now only six leit
to carry on the work.

Americans Were Gnlmls

The American troops in Siberia
were not allowed to light the Bolshe-
vists, but were supposed only to
guard the trains and roads. Major
Lyons tells ol one instance when
twenty- three American soldiers were
killed by the Reds while guarding a
road about iiity miles from Vladi»
vostuk.

"The transportation in Siberia is
very poor, the only railroad being the
Trans-Siberian which is not sutlicient
to cover that inuncusc country. Great
diiiiculty was experienced in tialls—
porting the retugccs to their homes in
in Russia. In one case a thousand
children were iound by the Rod Cross

ELLIOTT TURNS GUNS
ON FREE SPEEOH

Urges Courage of Convictions—
Dislikes “Spaghetti-Spined"
Christians.

"Dad" Elliott brought the students
oi Gl'innell squarely face to lace with
college questions at chapel Tuesday
evening. He gavc‘ out the command
to "he merciless in the judgment oi
ourselves, and very mercilul in the
Judgment of others."

The “spaghetti-sinned christian”
who hasn't cnough backbone and
nerve to do the things which he
knows to be ght is to blame tor
prevailing situations, according to
Elliott.

“One oi the iirst marks or an odor
cated man or woman is that ot scll'
control." When one loses his self
control and swears he falls into one
oi iour classes: The poor, lowly ig-
noramus, the liar, the weak one with
spaghetti for a spine; the man who
means every word of it.

’ "Have the courage of your conviCr
lions”, was “Dad’s" challenge to
Grinnell men and women.

“Anybody can go with the current,
show me the man who is standing
against the current and I'll show you
a liie that has power.” -

Wednesday Morning

“The supreme test or religion is

life," declared “Dad” Elliott in chapel
this morning. Continuing, Elliott
pointcd out that the supreme test ot
lite is growth, and that ’the supreme
test oi growth is nourishinan The
lite that is strong physically demands
nourishment, and tho liie that is
strong sp itually demands nourishr
meat.
"God is a father, and the desire ct
cvery father is for the greatest dcvelc
opmeuts oi every child. it this is the
desire oi we human rather-s, so much
more is it the desire of God, the iather
oi all. Going further, in the well rege
ulated family, the rather does not
give his child some things until the
child asks ior them, God does not
give us some things until we ask Him
for them. We all may in in. crisis, but
that is not the kind of prayer 1 meim.
There is something more in prayer
than that."

"Anything that is growing wants
exercise. The growing boy, the ath-
lctc, unless he is overtl‘aincd, demands
cxcrci ii the spiritual lilc is grow-
ing, it liuds exercise in service. As
in the biological world, the lite that is
growing spiritually has power oi re
production. When it ccoses to havc

‘ this power, it is either sick or dying.

The question is what kind or life are
we gomg to reproduce. Arc we going
tut reproduce the bad or the good?"

ASSIGN SECTION
FOR WOMEN ONLY

Wisconsin Would Revive 01d Pep
By Dividing Crowd.

In an attempt to revive the old
Wisconsin spirit, a special section in
thc bleachers at lootball games has
been designed for women attending
the game alonc, according to the
Daily Cardinal, student ncwspopcr.
The experiment is being tricd to help
the cheering, and provides a reserved
suction, both ior uniocd cheering on
the part of the women, and also gildlu
anlccs them good seats, so they will
be encouraged to come to the games.

The plan was considered in Grill-
hell, but was not adopted because it
was decided that a lliivod crowd was
casicr to haudlc than one divided into
groups as above. The results oi the
experiment will be watched with in.
tcrcst over the country.

ELLIOTT BITTER
m BENUNGIATION
0F [THERE LIFE

Social Life Lamentable

Is Opinion of
Speaker.

in o iicry and pcricctly frank and
open spcccb, “Dad" Elliott, college
speaker and 500m] Worker, opened his
series ol six lectures at the chapel
period Tuesday morning. Using a
“Billy Sunday" style oi oratory, he.
showed his pvoiouud loyalty to his
ruthel' radical views on the weakness-
es oi college liic, and uphraided many
pct theories ou college tradition and
government, defying his audience to
Idisllrove his statements.

His opening speech was in the na—
turc cl an introductiou to many or the
destructive sidcs of colleges in gen-
eral. l-le particularly attacked the
present day system or intercollegiate
athletic training, saying that it is in-
compatible with thc academic work,
the morals, and the physical condition
or the participant. Easing his argu<
ments on his own experience as on
athlete-tor Northwestern University.’
he denounced the present system as
crooked and as having a spirit oi
“win honestly, ii you cans but win".

College Dance Immorlll
cht to athletics, the social question
cl the college received the brunt of
his attack. The most surprising
statement oi his whole speech was
perhaps the one with relation to danc—
ing.
“Dancin§"u he said, “not only has
la bad inﬂuence on college life, but its
existence in college draws high school
students into bud social and moral
situations. It has been proven by ac—
tusl investigation that the lowest icrm
oi social liic in this country is not
found in the slums, but in the colleges.
The form of dancing in college, such
as shimmying, cheek to cheek dancing,
etc, is worse in college than in any
other social sector.”

rratcrulty An Evil

The fraternity question, the college
political situation, and the Honor sys-
tem in vogue in some colleges also
came in [or their part oi the storm.
KHe branded the ri-aternity system as
the most un-Americcn and 'undenio-
cratic institution in American colleges
today. He said that it made the stud-
cnts triVlal, superﬁcial, and inditier—
cut.
The political situation in colleges
he, denounced as situations "that
,would make Tammany blush with
‘shamon' For rotten and crooked poli-
ltics, he said the college has no equal
or no Deer.

As for -thc Honor system, there
seemed to be little honor lcit among
studcnts sccor mg to his iindings in
the institutions be had visited, and
thc cases he had iuves gated.

Tile iorcigu students were the oh~
jcct ol his plea. His charges against
the treatment accorded loveigu stud—
culs in colleges he had such were ol
the most bitiel sort. Tbcre was little
chance [or a squarc deal, in most
.schools, according to his statements.
Collogc honors were not obtainable by
torcigncrs, and social recognition was
not lorthcoming.

Elliott dwell lor some time on the
met that the way to judge a college
is by its output, rather than its past
history. Hc sct (birth as the greatest
problem in the world today, the trains
