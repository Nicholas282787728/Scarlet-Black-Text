TDNTI NEIN ITNIES NTIE
ENIIDTED DI SENIITE

Smoking lIlraliition is Modiﬁed by
Senate; Visiting Hours Also
Are Changed.

A special meeting or the new Men's
senate was held last night {or the
purpose of reiutcrating some of the
rules for men which were passed by
the old Senate, to put into concrete
form two rules which have been un—
written in the past, and to pass [our
new lztws.

The old rules which were reaffirm-
ed were those dealing with quiet
hours in the Dormitories and con-
duct in the dining room. The two
which have been unwritten in the
past are those relating to drinking and
gambling.

Four laws were made which are
new and the ﬁrst of these has to do
\l'tih smoking on the campus. 1n-
stead of prohibiting smoking on the
campus at any time it was decided
that a ban should he placed on it only
(luring certain hours. This decision
was reached since it ’seemed inad-
visable, if not impossible, to attempt
the enforcement of a rule against
smoking on the college grounds at
