Aalrutl Tillisch, noted Norwegian
singer, who will present her unusual}
program oi iolk music in Herl

Chapel, rhiduy night, Fell 2, as the
toultli numhei oi the lecture course.

Madame Tillisch's program is not‘

a “concert” in the accepted sense of
the word. She has more than tones
and sounds to utter. l-Ier interpreta-
tion oi her native songs is dramatic-
ally presented, indicating thoro trains
ing in literature, art and sculpture,
all oi which iniluence her graceful
postures and vivid pictures.

Her programs appeal alike to mu-
sicians, historians, artists and stu-
dents of literature” Many of her
songs are echoes oi the ancient bards,
suggesting those cclol‘ful' days when
strolling minstrcls sang their lays
to eager listeners,

l’resenm Entirely Folk Music

Madame Tiliisch ,is the only artist
in the United States who presents
a program entirely oi folk music
To imbue herseli with the spirit oi

the peasant songs she interprets, this}

artist iourneyed recently ,to her na—
tive Norway and spent months among
the mountain people, absorbing their

, ideas and their personalities. with
her husbnnd and little daughter, she
lived the life or these simple people.
She scrubbed their ﬂoors, churned
butter, cooked, hunted in the iorests.
listened to thein tales and songs and
danced their exhilarating dances.

“It was gloriousl" she testiiies,
"I ielt like a sturdy pioneer, laugh-
ing at the struggle tor existence and
singing in the face of cold and hard-
ship."

“No one could get the spirit oi the
Norse songs, living in case and lux-
ury. I looked into the hearts oi the
sturdy peasant iolk and iound there
the real understanding in their prim—
itive music." '

Knows litany Unwritten .Songs

Incidentally, Madame Tilisch
learned irom her peasant friends’
many songs unknown to the music
world. Trusting and admiring her.
the mountain people taught her doz-
ens oi songs which never have been
transcribed but have passed from
singer to singer through countless
generations.

This interesting artist varies her
musical programs with‘ discripuve in—
terpolations, She is steeped in iolk-
lore to her fingertips. Her admirers
call her "The Spirit oi Scandinavia."

Among her close iricnds in Norway
are Jens Wang, the famous scenic ar—
tist of the National Theatre, Ch
tlauz, and Johnna Halvorsep, the no-
ted composer. Jens Wang is best
lmown as the creator oi settings tor
Ibsen's plays and as the artist who
designed much scenery for Sarah
Bernhardt’s productions. As a sne»
cial compliment he painted a remark—
able set of scenery tor Madame Til.
liscli, which she uses in some or her
concerts.

All her concerts are given in cus-
tume, made for her by Norwegian
peasants, She has chosen the dress
worn by women in picturesque Sat~
ersdalen, Tho gown is black home-
spun, bound in red, purple and green.
Over this is worn a black apron, elab-
orated with fllowers and bound in
gold and magnets. Her ivlngcd silk

headdress is hand embroidered. Over
a whim blouse she wears ﬁred bodice,
and about her waist ls wound a. woven
belt, many yards in length. Her jew-
els are quaint silver ornaments and
colorful beads. Her accompanist,
Miss Helen Birmingham, alsu appears

1111 NEBRASKA AGAIN
, NEXT illill NIGHT

Pioneers Hope to 'Avenge 20.131
Defeat. Here Last Satur-
day Evening.

By Fred stoutcn.

Grinnel'l goes to Nebraska Friday in
an attempt to avenge the 20 to 13
defeat administered by the Cornhusk-
ers last Saturday night on the local
floor. In this game, as in the Ames
encounter, the dope was badly spilled.

Snatchlng vlctor'y from defeat is
oiten read about in the “best sellers",
but is enacted out quite oiten with
Grlnnel playing the part oi the defeat-
ed rival. In Saturday night's game,
for example, the Pioneers led at half
time 9 to s, but allowed the Nebraska
team to come up from behind and
tuck away a 7-point lead, as well as
two victories out oi three starts tor
their low. invasion.

It is hoped by loyal Grinnellisns
that the repetltlun at this type oi
some will soon cease, and it is be-
lieved that the Nebraska team is the
logical one on which to break over.
Although the Nebraska team has the
advantage, both in winning one game
and in playing on their home floor.
a Grinnel victory is s. possibility.
