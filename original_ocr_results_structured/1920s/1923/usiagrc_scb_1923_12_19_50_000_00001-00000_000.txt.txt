FEW SERIES

AMATEUR lHESPlANS
STAGE HNE [lﬂAAElll

“Enter Madame” Gust; Is Praised
For Excellent Rendition of
Difficult Play.

"Enter Madame," the temper-mental
comedy which was presented at the
Colonial Saturday evening, evoked a
great deal of praise from the large
audience. it was a happy evening
for all concerned. To begin with,
this was a sprightly, gay comedy; add
to that excellent acting, attractive set»
ting and effective lighting and you
have a combination that is almost per-
feet.

"Enter Madame" presented difficult—
ies that are usually formidable to
amateur actors. it is a comedy in
which atmosphere and mood play a.
large part. That this atmosphere
was achieved, and retained through-
out is an accomplishment deserving of
much praise. In the hands of Miss
Thompson and her associates, “Enter
Madame,” ran the gamut of gay, Sophr
isticated comedy. It was at times
brilliant. and for the most part each
performance was sustained.

Good Support Given wihiin Thompson

Bernard Craven was splendid as the
ubiquitous Archimede; his perform—
ance left little to be desired. Wilma
Nichols, Eloise boomis, Howard
Backus, and Wendell Metealf, as the
quarrelling domestics added to the
fun, and completely mastered the
linguistic difficulty of their parts.

Louise iioyle as Flora Preston, did
‘bits of excellent acting. Her res-
traint, her poise, and her charm made
the role convincing. Harry- Lambly
as Madame-s phleginatic husband,
played his part in an even manner,
with little variation. He had much
to do and he dit it well. Randolph
Hewitt and Lucile Hindol'f were real
as the young lovers, Miss Hindorff be—
ing especially effective pictorially.

The evening belonged to Wilma
Thompson, for this is a play about
Madame Lisa Della ftobia. Miss
Thompson was striking in appearance,
unusually natural and convincing
throughout the play. She played her
emotional scenes with admirable re-
straint.

The stage artists, Work, Budlong,
Hall and Bilharz, provided a setting
which was entirely adequate

The play owes part of its success to
Mr. Trumbauer whose direction is
responsible for many excellent fear
tures.

MESSIAH Pliitlltn
fut llBBE AUDIENBE

Excellent Work Done by Chorus
and Soloists in AnmIaI
Presentation.

The Messiah, with its inspirational
dignity, which was given Sunday eve-
ning to a crowded chapel, fittingly ins
troduced the festivities of Christmas
week.

The majestically rich and powerful
strains of Handel swept into the ell—
max, the solemn exaltdtiun ofthe Hal—
lelul'ah chorus.

Elias Blum opened the program with
"Every Valley shall be excited,"
Elizabeth Stevens’ solos possessed a
sweet appeal. Helen Schmeltz, by the
warm animation of her tones, excited
admiration in her two numbers, “Be-
hold a. virgin shall conceive" and
"Then shall the eyes of the blind."
Arthur FaguyvCotc interpreted “For
behold the darkness" and "The pea-v
pic that Walked in darkness" with a
rich expressiveness which his poise
enhanced. Philip Kalar's solos were
full of dulcet resonance and power.

The choruses showed the results of
careful training. In "For unto us a
Child is born" the choristers trans-
mitted to the audience the joy of the
selection

The orchestra, playing enthusiasti-
daily, was inclined, especially toward
the middle of the program, to domin.
ate over the soloists. Laurel E. Ans
derson at the organ admirably supple—
mented the work of the choruses and

soloists with his mellow (ones.

ANNUAL stuut u
YULE £1“. Al uuu

Pagan and Christian Custom Is
Observed While President’
Main Speaks.

The annual Yule Log service was
held in the Quadrangle drawing—room
Sunday afternoon at five o‘clock.

Mrs. Smiley pl Veil a. prelude While
the white—clad g assembled in the
Candle-lit drawing-room.

The Yule Log service followed. Dor-
othy Bickel, president of the Y. M. C.
A., told of the age-old pagan and
Ch 'Stlun custom of lighting on
Christmas Eve a huge log which
should burn “Bill the Twelfth Night
feast, unless misfortune was to visit
the house. Marian Read, president of
the Women’s Self-Government League
presented the Wrcnlh which, accordr
lug CD the Quadrangle custum, is laid
upon the log. it is the wreath of joy
and sorrow which is woven by each,
of us through the year. “We dedi-
Cﬂle, not sacrillce this wreftt ,” she
said. “Lei, us, its we dedicate this
wreath with hearts full of gratitude

finer wreath for the cumin gyear."
The wreath was then laid upon thE
log, which was lighted with the
charred remnants of last years log.

“Silent Night", followed by an in.
terlnde, was softly played by Mrs,
Smiley as the first flames crackled
up around the log.

Then president Main, with unusual
warmth and inspiration, brought out
the place which fire has always token
in human civilization since Promethus
snatched it irom heaven and brought
it to men, afterwards given into the
keeping of the Vestal Virgins. “Fire,"
said President Main. "symbolizes
warmth, fellowship, and beauty. bet
us, as we kindle this fire, carry away
its beauty in our hearts, to last
through the coming years.“

A qnsrtette, compose dof Dorothy
Eickel, Ruth Norton, Ruth Hurlbut,
and Ethel Van Fossefl, song “0 Little
Town of Bethlehem". The Christmas
story was read by Miss Read, and the
service was closed with a prayer and
an Amen.

This is the ninth successive Yule
Log which has been lighted since the
dedlcatiou of the Quadrangle in 1915.
The service is one which really be.
longs to Crinncll, and which all girls
who have lived in the Quadrangle res

First Five Showing in Scrimmage
Promises Well For Gopher
Games N ext Week.

In their first scrimmage of the year
yesterday afternoon against the fresh—
men, the varsity basketball squad
ran up a total or 3!) points in twenty-
ciglit minutes of play as compared to
the yearling score of 1G eonnteis. The
varsity squad was newly outfitted in
the suits which they are to wear a
saints the Copltei- five next week.

The first five which the coaches
sent into action were Captain Benz,
Winter, Gelviu, Wing, and Critchett.
This combination suceeded in baf-
fling the first year defensive, getting
a number of clean baskets. Every
man on the squad received his chance
to get into the fray for at least one
quarter of the contest. Benz showed
up in excellent form for the varsity,
scoring 22 of the as points.

The squad has been working hard
under the direction of coaches‘ Mac-
Encbi-on and Elward, and ought to be
in fair condition for the games with
Minnesota ll. at Minneapolis the 28th
and 29th of December. The men will
only be allowed a few‘days at home
for Xmas after which they will meet
in Minneapolis the 27th.

Schedule Am'ltllgell

After the tilts with the Gophers, the
Crinnell cagci-s will return home to
prepare for the first Missouri Valley
contest with Washington at Grinnell
on January 4. The second valley cou—
tcst is with Missouri at Grinnell on
the 7th, the night before school
opens, and it is expected that a great
number of students will return in
time to see the Missouri game.

The basketball schedule this season
is on the same plan as last year. Each
valley school may play eighteen
games, all but two of them coming in
the valley round robin plan which has
been used the last two seasons. Ac-
cording to this plan, each team plays
each other team twice during the
season, once on the local floor and
once on the floor of the opponent.
This gives the Grinnell rooters an op-
portunity to see every cage team in
the valley in action, with the excel!
tion of the Washington team, which
will play here during the Christmas
vacation.
