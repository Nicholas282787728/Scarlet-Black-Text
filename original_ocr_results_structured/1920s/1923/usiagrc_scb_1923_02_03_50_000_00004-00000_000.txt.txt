Propose Bill to Deni] ‘
Students Use of Cars

-A bill to prohibit the use or motor
cars by students at any of the smte
schools, for pleasure or recreation,
was introduced in the Kansas senate
yesterday by Senétur Vandemark, of
Cloud county.

The bill is interpreted to apply
only to those students who use motor
Cars for “juyrides” and not against
lhose who might be so situated that
they would need ears to reach their
classes.

It is intended that the prohibition
c: motor Gill's will make "deinccm
ey” a. bigger factor in the state in-
stitutions Cars are held to detract
from school Work and the hill is ins
tended to remedy the situation.

Kansas University has already ex-
pressed a sentiment against the use
0: motor cars by students for pleas—

Chnncenos Lindley sent out letters
to all parents or University students
‘i-egueshng that cars should he lelt
at home. Other state institutions
hcvc already taken measures to regin
late the use of cars by students.
