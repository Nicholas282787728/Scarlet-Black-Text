LEAGUE 0F )A’I'IONS MOVES TO

According to information reaching
]the secretariat of the League of Na-
.tious at Geneva ,hunian slaves are be-
ing sold on the block in Abyssillia. at
prices ranging from $2.1 down to $5 a
head. Rich liussulmcus living in the
interior of Asia iiiuor have been the
purchasers. Abyssinia is not a mom»
her of the league and therefore under

pass him. Walters specded up and‘
came in with an advantage of two or
three yards, for a new Amos track
record of 3:41.

The squad which made the trip was
largely composed of sophomores in
their iii-ts year of college competition,
and included Capt. Daugherty, Mo-
ilrath, Meyer, Porter, Jansscn, L.
Jones, Hass. Gillette, Stock. Patton.
Green, Kersten, Jack Boga, stotts.
Howard, Taylor, and Kltcbcn.

The showing of the Gzinnell team
was excellent, and bids fair to increase
as the outdoor season approaches, and
the new members gain experience.

Holmes and Baker at
., Prayers Last Sunday

LaNor Holmes spoke at Prayers
Sunday morning at the Quadrangle on
the subject, “Making Good Contag-
ious." She told the fairy story of the
angel who flew over a village and

dropped the seed of "doing good" into

the heart of an old man: how this tiny
seed grew and the habit of doing good
was spread by one ml: to all the in-
habitants of the town. She then 5.))—
[llied the story to our life In college,
saying that even (me person might
start the Contagion of "doing good" in

a beautiful colored picture of Leonard
iT. Paulu in the act of leaving his
mark for one of his Whirlwind dashes.
This picture was presented by the
Child Art Rooms and it hangs upon
the Wall of “Don" Huff's office in a.
gneat frame.

radio will be remembered as last
year's track capmin and one of the
greatest Gl‘innell sprinters, of all
time. Appearing in a track suit in
his sophomore year to “get exercise,”
he won the two short dashes in the
state meet as a preparation for his
fame as a sprinter. Paulo won the
hundred dash for three successive
years in the state meet, is feat which
no one else has accomplished.

Versatile Recon]

As the men look at this wonderful
action [llcture in the Men's gyms!-
um, they see the man who broke the
tape in the two short dashes of the
Intercollegiate Meet last June, thus
establishing a remarkable individual
record for himself and a bigger re—
cord foc Grinnell Maltese Cross on
Cinders. As the professors viewi this
picture of the speed demon, they think
of him rial a. man who ranked high as
a scholar in the classroom. It will
recall not only a dash man of nation-
ial pepnte, but a student who com—
bined a Plli beta Kappa key with his
sm‘inter‘s spikes.
