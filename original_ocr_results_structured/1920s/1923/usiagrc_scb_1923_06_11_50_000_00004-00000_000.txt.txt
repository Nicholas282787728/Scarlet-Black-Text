He was sure that the soul would

It certainly was the mind of a su-

are beyond G is beyond, just as

I venture to hope that we all agree
with Mr. Walpole who says in one or
his works that we are in this world
tor just one purpose: namely, to lis-
ten "The pi-imaiy duty of a great
artist,“ he shys, “is to listen tor the

conﬁne it to the artist It is the pri-
mary duty of any man, any state,

It has succeeded. It will succeed
when we are ready to give it the sup-‘
port of a sympathetic understanding.
It is beyond the political microscope.
but it has an abiding place in the‘
realm of creative justice. We aili
know that returning evil tor cvl.

projects disaster, coniustion and wart

lily lriend still insisted that the
words ct Jesus could not be l'ezillzed..
He failed to grasp the signiﬁcance of‘
the progressive rceliza ion or the ideail
that reaches on to the limits of beingl

Following this conversation, I r
called a statement made in my hear.
ing by a thonghtlul student fl om In.
that in one of our American institu-i
tions. It was to this etlcct “I re—
ject Christianity because it i impose
sibla, Its commands reach beyond u .
They cannot be realized. Christianity
is not Divine. The commands oi has
us were spoken by a dreamer oi im-
possible things."

We should reply to t criticism
that the principles of Jesus . -e not
impossible They are inﬁnite in their
reach and are our directions in the
proce s or growth. ,lcsus looked into
the roaches oi etcrni y and saw with
his soul‘s eye the imp ushahle values
at this life oi ours which we call hue
man lite ,and say the unending pro-
ces on or lite—not merely our lilc
here. but the inﬁnite liie which makes
this universe i living thing, and an
eteinaily growi g thing, instead or a
dead thing,

The progress or the world is a
series of realized ideals. The most in-
clusivc and most elemental oi all
ideals are the pronouncements or
Jesus. Men may say, as many do,
that they are imposs'hle oi realiz —
tion. Thank God this is true. but this
very fact is the supreme evldlmce of
their endless value.

Wc cannot realize the unive
at it. We cannot reallizc lruth~nll
ot it. We realize a little at it at a,
time Truth i, inﬁnite as the uni-
verse. Truth is the spiritual exvprcs.
sion oi the universe—the spiritual
universe is commensurate with the
pin ical universe We go on and on
toward perfection. This is a cause
for supreme JOY.

As I said in the beginning, you had
an ideal to come to college. Ynii have
realized it. In doing so I trust you
have planted other ideals in your
minds which Will last as you progres—
sivciy realize them, not only through
lilc btit through eternity. ..

And so they will, it you have even
a little ot the divine ﬁre in you which
is in the words of Jesus the Christ.
I pray you adopt an ideal that will go
on torever, one that you can realize
as you do your work today and to-
morrow and so on through the years.

A current magazine article, reports
this or whistler, the artist I quote it
in suhstancc. “Wlllzn an artist in any
line reaches the point where he Cons
sidcrs his work perlect. that artist
has reached his zenith. The thing is.
yoir see, to push your zenith so near
the stars that you will continue to
grow in power in vision, as long as
life lasts, This is the test of the true
artist—ta have his zenith with the
stars". ,

As I intimated awhile ago, the reach
of our ideal is the test of our man-
hood and womanhood. We have often
wondered, I suppose, what it was in
Peter that gave him such distinction

in the estimation of Jesus. It is this:
Peter realized what to the others was
impossible anti inconceivable. He
went beyond the observed facts of life
into the unseen.

Jesus asked his disciples this (was
lion, “Whom do men say that I, the
Son at man, am?" There were var»
ious answers, ‘

Then he turned to his disciples and
asked this further iQuestlon, “But
whom say ya that I :tm'!"

Peter answered, “Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the Living God ”

Peter had watched the qualities of
Jesus as they expressed themselves
in power and in love, and Wes unable
to Find any match for ihcin in the en-

la! order, in creed, or ill gm‘el‘ -
iuent, in the wul‘lzl as he knew it
there was no explanation for them.

To 2 plain them he as obliged to

the qualities round, in their reality,

Petcr must have lelt at this mo—
iueut ol inspiration something like
this: The truth ol Jesus is the Truth
‘the Truth oi God. The love at
Jesus is the love or God.
Jesus is the lite or God here among
men. lie is, He is the Son of the
living. God. .

This is the initial announcement or
a wholly new order in the life of men
and the institutions oi men. It pro-
claimed iii the little group of disciples
the fellowship and love of God in the
iv rld It signalizcd the union of thc
spi tiial unive c with the world of
material things It projected God into

as they were then and- as they still
are.

It placed the prinlcpleE llustrsted
by Jesus ioremost in. the great husl-
ness of achieving the meaning of lite.
Peta saw what to the world was im»

, ihle. He saw what is still im-
po, ihlc ful'uzichievement to a ﬁnality
because oi its iniinitc reach into the
universe or God. Impossible oi
achievement because endless, but pass
'sible everyday in bringing new sweet-
ness and light into life.

Possible through the coming years
as man grows to know better the
meaning ol this universe of suns and
stars and at the same time the mean-
ing ol the greater universe beyond the
suns and stars which, thought not
seen, is eternal.

Hence, the glory and demonstration
at the words of Jesus are that they
are impossible_ impos ble to rcalize

to a ﬁnality, but forever possible anti'

illexbustlble. through all ages, as the
Source of all things that make our
common life. our national life, and
our World life, the ﬁlm] expression
for us of the goodness and majesty of
God.
BELOVED:

I ask you to remember What Peter
said to Jesus “Thou art the Christ.
the Son of the Living God."

1 also ask you to call to mind the

ﬁnal words to Peter when Jesus metl

his disciples for the last time. "Simon
Peter, son 0! Jonas. LOVeSl'. than me
more that these?" .;

He seeyth unto him. “lite, Lord,
thou knowest that I love thee."

He said unto him, “Feed my lambs".

He felt them to be!

The two incidents we may be sure
belong together. Peter has a gl'
of the inﬁnite reach of the spi
Christ into thc heart oi Godiinto
the unseen, into the unrealized ideal
glnto the ideal that was never to be
realized. But Jesus shows Feter, and,
through Peter, all the world how the
ideal is to realize itsell progressively
here in the world.

It you listen you will hear the voice
or God telling you where to establish
your ideal of life and how to work

“Quality and Not
Size, Determines a
Good College”gMain

President J, H. T. Main was the
[chapel speaker Monday. He began by
{sayillg that quality and not size its
tel-mines a guod College. The College
cultivates ilemacl'ady tum sell—gov—
einnient, and the alumnus should al—
\va 5 remember the debt he owes his
college some people think that the
'college shmlld not frequently ask the

laiumni for money, but no student can

'iever lully repay a college for the ser-
vice hc has received from it. Yearly
contributions are made to church,
charities, etc, and why not to the
college, as a tangible means ot show-
ing gratitude, and repaying the col-

legc [or what it has given?
