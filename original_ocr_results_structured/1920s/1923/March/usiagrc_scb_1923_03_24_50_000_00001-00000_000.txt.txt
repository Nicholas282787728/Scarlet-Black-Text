COACH ELWARD EXHIBITS ABILITY
IN FIELD OF FLOWING ELOQUENCE

Ever since the night of the Honor
G stag party we have heard the pra—
ises of Coach Elwurd sung us a mill)
who could only turn out good athletic
teams but was also not at all back-
ward in the field of the spoken word.
Naturally our curiosity wits aroused
and a stall reporter was sent around
to interview Coach Elwul'd and get
that speech at [Lil costs which evoked
so much unqualiﬁed praise. A few
(lays inter this reporter came breezlng
into the office and handed us the fol-
lowing manuscript Read it and judge

where does it come from, how is it re
taincd, and why is it lust?

"The dictionary says that spirit
means ardor, dash or iii-c we put into

"Whenever a body of people get to-
gether for some specitlc purpose they
first must have the right spirit to
carry out that purpose and the spirit

this—that in order to get the right
kll‘ld of enthusiasm in a college we
must have the same kind of spirit in
everything. not only in athletics Make
the debater feel that be is doing just
as much for the college as the hero in
athletics.

"College spiritis lost when too much
attention is given to any one thing by
the student. College spirit is lost
when the student body is split up in-
to different groups. one group work-
ing for one thing and one for another;
we must all pull together and root to—
gather in everything.

“Every college has its ups and
downs in athletics. 1’. think that the
biggest reason for it is that when our
teams arc going good and winning
consistently we begin to dual: in the
present and do not prepare for the

good men gone and no one to take
their places. Instead of trying to
make athletes out of man who never
had lunch athletic training we have
left it all to those who did ,bavc. We
reason that all men should come out
and try for the teams and be given
the required amount of consideration
by the coaches.

Winning teams mean good spirit in
athletics and good college spirit, and
that brings us to unotller question,—
