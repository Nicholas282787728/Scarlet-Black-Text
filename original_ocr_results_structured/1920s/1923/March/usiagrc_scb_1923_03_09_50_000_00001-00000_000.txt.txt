Speaker Says Labrador Is Well
Worth Developing Both Eco-
nomically and. Socially.

A MORAL AND SPIRITUAIZ
REGENERATION POSSIBLE

Praises League of Nations But
Deprecales Fact That U. S.
Has Not Joined It.

Illustrating his talk With slides and
moving pictures depicting life In Lab-
. rador, Dr. Greniell held a large audi-
ence with his lecture Friday night.
In speaking or a country about which
50,Ve ' little isvllnown, Dr. Grenlell
ielt iorced to choose only certain lent—
ures tor the great diversity oi liie
there. Labrador is undeveloped, ﬁsh—
ing and the iur industry being the
only trades exploited; but in com.
parison with the condition among the
poor whites of the Kentucky moun-
tzllus who settled on this continent at
5. later date, the children of the north
have attained a ingher stage oi devcl——
opulent. .Neithel' group, oi course,
can read or write; but Dr. Greniell
{eels that illiteracy is not as uncom-
mon as we are prone to think and that
education cannot be summed up in an
accumulation oi knowledge oi facts.
Labrador people are more educated
than we in that we could not live in
their country with their equipment
And They have much to give us spirit-
ually in the way oi highly developed
unseliisnness, hospitality, and simplic—
ity. Dr, Grenlell mentioned as an
illustration, a man who carried him
‘across an open hay in a. small boat
to aid destituhe neighbors suffering
with disease whom he hag taken into
his home and cared ior without any
remuneration although he himself was
too poor to buy milk ior his children.
The northern cold which many peo-
ple iear is to Dr. Greniell largely a
hallucination. By means oi suitable
clothing and the utilization at “double
sunlight" the inhabimnts feel no harm-
iul eiiects irom the six months period
or snow. Through the inﬂuence oi
climate northerner: 0! every age have
been a progressive, restlss, dominating
mee. ”Everyone loves the Winter, he
said, “and no one notices the cold
there, but I do notice it when I re-
- to En lisb houses."
Ni: ansrifr to the nuery "W'hy live in
Labrador Dr. Greniell said, ’Why
not:~it is a country well worth de—
veloping irom an economic as well as
a social polnt of view.” Reindeer alone
are an immense source of wealth and
gold has recently been discovered.
But the most important reason is that
by living there one can enable the peo-
ple to get greater value out or their
lives. The apparent brutality oi the
Idsldmc in his treatment oi the weak
and aged is due only to his diiiercnt
standards which can be considerably
broadened. A moral and spiritual re—
generation is as possible as a physical
one. The simplicity oi the ﬁshermen,
their rigid code oi ethics with its de-
mand for strict Sunday observance;
and the capacity oi the boys and girls
ior innnite work and loyalty all appeal
to Dr. Grenieli as being distinctly
worth aiding. V _
"The joy or life," he said, "is not in
having things but in doing them! To
illustrate his point he spoke oi Dr.
Andrews, iorlnerly a consulting ocullst
in New York. and now working in the
north, giving sight to hundreds without
any lee whatever. «Dr. Greniell be-
lieves that there are many others in
this country who have been given
great ability, power, ideals, and em
thusiaam and who only need great
scope ior their activities. He pointed
to the League oi Nations as another
great form ior civilization, but stated
that its power would have been greatly
increased it America had become a
member. The true purpose oi llie be
ieels should be to make a better world
—he thereioro considers himseli no
martyr in Labrador. but enjoys his
work as the others do.
By means or slides Dr. Greniell gave
a more deﬁnite impression as to the
physical characteristics oi the north
with its rocks coasts, high cliiis, deep
canyons, iiords and icebergs. He also
showed the results or his work there—-
the hospitals, schools, orphanages.
. clubs, shops, manufacturies and scien-
tiﬁc agriculture which he has estab-
lished. The units oi college men who

Germany May Soon Be Subdued;
Brookhart Thinks More
31005 Are Needed.

The French are continuing their ad—
\‘ilnce into the Ruhr 'valley, and are
strengthening their customs cordon as
they advance. They have occupied
three more German towns, east oi the
British zone. As a result oi the
French advance, two iactorles at Ober-
hnusen have given 8,000 employes an
eiglitrday vocation. ,

Germany is at present strengously
opposing the advance‘oi the French,
and ii the French should continue
their advance ior any time, Germany
will soon be brought to a prostrate
condition. In the Ruhr, there are no

'povts whatever, and production is be«
log out daily. Germany is trying‘to
make up for this drain on her resour-
ces, but she lacks the raw materials,
such as the coal and iron oi the, Ruhr,
a'nd her currency is so depreciated
that she ﬁnds it diiiicult to obtain

behind the cooperative movement. But
they are not strong enough and large
enough to have control oi the policy

groups should tom and join the agrl-A

cents out of the dollar which labor
pays ior his products, and labor gets
only 35 cents out or the dollar which
the (timer pays for his products. The
remainder goes tor the expenses oi dis-

the loci that these students seemed to
have iully realized the value “oi the
contribution they could make to the bio
of their country and were discussing
only how best thc contribution could
be made.

hollering that American students
uould enjoy meeting some oi Lhése
men and would get many interesting
ideas l'rom talking with them, The N. -

rite six oi them to visit our American
colleges,

Last summer, John Rothschild, E

ccutive Secretary of the Forum, and‘

George D. Fl'fltt, Junior Foreign Sees
l'etdl‘y, visited ten European countries
in order to select those students. The
young men ranging in age from 21-28
were ﬁnally chosen irom .Germany,
Holland, Denmark, CzeGhD-Slovakla
and England in which countries young
people are taking the most active part
in reconstructing the national life.
The students were chosen ln every
case because they know all the groups

or young people in their country andl

could interpret the spirit. at each. They
are not propagandists for any Diu'tl'clb
Only two ol
Them are members of political parties.
Jorgen Holhk who is a Danish Socials
ist, and VVil‘liam Robson Who is a. mem-
ber oi the English Labour Party. They
come to give us what they have iound

of most value in their countries, ask».

These students are touring the col-
loges in two groups oi three each.
One group Will be at Grinnell from

March 2S,to March 28, and they will

speak in Chapel March 26 and 27 at
8:40 o'clock. Afterwards they will
live with the students (or a day or

For many longweeks we have labor—

It's a great liie il ya durrt \l'eakeni

we‘re going to slide and glide and

ture Work Now. ‘

Outside practice ior spring football
will ‘not begin until alter the spring
vacation, according to A. 'H. Elward,
coach, but the men are meeting in the
gymnasium twice a week now im-
skull practice.

The ioundntiou work is being stres-
sed by Coach Elward, who believes
that no iootball team can be a winner
unless they hive the rudiments oi the
game thoroughly in their minds. In
working toward this end he is build-
mg the team irom the ground up, and
is giving the skull practice to hi! the
interested members oi the squad in
preparation ior the later outside work.

The inside work includes lectures
giving the thcroy oi charging; block-
ing, and the positions oi each. Elward
Yis giving turtbcr instruction on the
rudiments oi the iorward pass, how
to throw and how to catch the pigskin

, He asks all men who are out now in
ispenil as much time as possible in the
Symposium on boxing and wrestling,
and in playing handball. Especial sm-
phasis is placed on hand ball, as El-
ward says that it dcrelopes both and
accuracy, two main ‘requisites or a
successiul in'ntboll player. ‘

A squad oi iiity men are expected
ollt alter spring vacation, as soon as
the men begin their outdoor work,
This work will mu tor a month or

days a week ior some, willie others
Will be asked to report every evening

ltheir studies cannot participate in
the spn'ugi practice, as this would de-
crease their chances of passing their

expressed himseli as being not too
kindly disposed to those men who do
not work their brain in the class
roorn will not do it on the football
iield.
