Fol-.ihe ﬁrst time in many years,
the state college track meet is being
held away iroln Des Moines, when
nine colleges compete at [Du-it City

for the state supremacy in track.
A large crowd or track euthusrasts

from all over the state have assembl-
ed at Iowa City to witness what
promises to he one or the best meets
or the past iew year )Vith a good,
warm day.severnl records are expect-
ed to fall. particularly the hurdles.
Brookins oi Iowa has been running
the hurdles in record time this spring,
and on two successive week ands,
competing in duals, he has run the
lows in time less than the world rec-
ord. The 220 yard dash, the pole
vault, and jarelin throw marks are
expected to iall.’ Lingenielter has
been hurling the iavelin about 180
feet during the past weeks. and it is
predicted that he will set a new state
mark in this event.

Iowa, with its large squad, and with
several exceptional men, will win the
meet easily, but that will not pre.
vent a hot battle for points in every
event.

or ten; Grinoell oualihed ﬁve; Ames

les in 24 2/10, 2/10 or a second raster
than the time made by Hoyt oi Grin—
nell in 1917, and be is expected to do
still better in the ﬁnal race.

-Taylor or Grinnell qualiﬁed in both
hurdle events, running second in the
heat that went in 15 mo. Shape 0!
Iowa won this heat. .Jones and Hass
both qualiﬁed in the hundred yard
dash, Jones taking a second in his
heat and Kass a third in his.

Orehaugb was the only man to
quality for Drake, getting a second in
the second heat or the high hurdles.

Grinnell has Point Winners
Taylor, Iiass, and Jones may be
counted on to win points for Grinneli
'in their events, and the presence of
Taylor will streughten the Pioneer
relay teams greatly. Ii Kitchen is in

second in both relays. With these two
men competing. our two relay teams

the exception or Iowa’s strong anar—
tet.

Bugs and Jensen are expected by
Grinnellians to win more than the
two points awarded as in the shot
put by the Capital "dopester", while
noge should give Denton oi brake a
real work .out in the discus throw.
Meyer has been doped to win the two

From the ar val oi' the Cyclone

‘A rush was made by hundreds oi stu-
