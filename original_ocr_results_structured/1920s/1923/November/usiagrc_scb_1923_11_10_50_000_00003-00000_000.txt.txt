Ehrenspel‘ger Addresses L D c a 1
Drama. League on Work of
Community centers.

At the meeting of the Grinell Drama ‘

League center held Wednesday eve—
ning in the Y. building, Mr. Harold
A. Ehransperger, executive secretary
of the Drama. League of America, de-
clared that the iundamentol aim of
drama league work is to make each
community so sincere, so ripe, and
so heautitul, that it will be more
powerful than glamour which might
draw its citizens sway. \

"Young 1130er usually believe," he'

said, “that by getting on the stage
they are beginning a ‘career', while
at the very moment they are over-
looking really big opportunities' in
their own communities—communities
which they feel they have out—grown."
Mr. Ehrensperger'went on to say that
the real trouble is that the portion»

r "home-town" does not make its

life big enough or ﬁne enough to keep
its people there.
‘ The work of the Drama League
center is to provide a recreation which
is enduring, to présent an intellect-
nal stimulus, to develop its members
through reading circles, and to plan
(or children’s work. The center,
should turnish an avocation'to sup—.
plement a vocation>lt should turn—
ish the sphere or activity from which
the future leaders or the community
,will appear.

Mrs Ebronsperger, who is Em

thoroughly as any man iii the country.

ceiving his M. A. trorn that univer-

Atter the arrival ol.‘ the tables some
arrangement will be made for their
Ilse and care but it 15 thought likely

in good shape but it~ls the general
opinion that they will be repaired

ONE PREP EQUALS

To Support Fifty-Six

Fifty-six Chinese students can he
sent to one oi the Grinnell in-China
high schools on the amount that the
average iieshman girl spends for a
year at college, Miss Reads Educa.
tlon A class estimated Tuesday fol»
lowing the Grinnell-‘lirChlna chapel

l service.

Carrying out the suggestion made
by Brewer Eddy or the American
Board or Foreign Missions, Miss Read
asked her class or freshman girls to

‘estimate their college expenses ex<

elusive of clothing and railroad fare.
They Lhen divided that amount by
515, the amount required to Send a.

[Chinese student to school one year. to

find the number of Chines who might
be benefitted by that amount.

The average estimate tor a year's
expenses was $2349, The individual es-

‘tlmates ranged all the way irom sale

to 51,200.
3320, $400, $500 and §535i

Other low estimates were
Most of

.these figures were submitted by girls

who had received scholarships or who
are working for their beau-d and did
not include these amounts in their
appraisement. There were titteen
evaluations of $1,000 or above.

“I think that the average estimate.
$849, is about what a girl ought to
spend to enjoy her college life," re—
marked Miss Read. “But I am sure
that most or the girls actually spend
much more than they judged last
Tuesday. Many or them have no rea1~
ization of the amount of money they
spend. in just goes; they don't know
where." ,

For those who are already interested in inter-
national aifairs MISS WAMBAUGH should prove
decidedly interesting because of the actual work
which she has accomplished in the ﬁeld on which
she lectures, especially as a member of the Secretai'y
of the League. For those not so interested in such
matters, MISS WAMZBAIlGH should be equally ydln— ‘
able because of the personal element with gvhich n.‘
colors ller lectures and‘because of her unusuiil ability
for putting life into supposedly dry and technical
subjects. I

Attendance of these lectures should be an oppor.
