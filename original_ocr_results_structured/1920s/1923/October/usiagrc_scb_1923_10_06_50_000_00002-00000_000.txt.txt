When Henry
rang the bell

If any bell was ever heard around the
world, Joseph Henry rang it in his
famous experiment at the Albany
Academy. The amazing development‘
of the electrical industry traces back
to this schoolmastef’s coil of insulated
wire and his electro-magnet that lifted
a ton of iron.

Four years later when Morse used
Henry’s electro—magnet to invent the
telegraph, Henry congratulated him
warmly and unselﬁshly.

The principle of Henry’s coil of wire is
utilized by the General Electric Com-
pany in motors and generators that
light cities, drive railroad trains, do
away with household drudgery and
perform the work of millions Of men.
