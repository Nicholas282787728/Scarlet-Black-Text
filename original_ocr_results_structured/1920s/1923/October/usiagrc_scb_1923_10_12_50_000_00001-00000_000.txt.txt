FIﬂNEEllS WﬂHK [llll
\ﬂN PIKEH EHIlllHﬂN
Hlll llllllll’S GAME

Coach Elwaxd and Twenty—two
Men Leave Thursday Night
for Washington U,

REGULAR LINE-UP WILL
START AGAINST PIKERS

Pikers Have Slight Advantage in
Weight in Predicted Close
Score Grouse.

Coach Elward took twenty-two men
to St. Louis Thursday night and gave
them 1 light workout on the Washing
ton [ield yesterday in preparation for
the Piuneei‘s’ first Valley start of the
season.

‘The, entire squad is in good condi-
tion with the possible exception oi
Wood and Dare who were injured in
the Parsons tilt Saturday. and have
been kept out ot scrimmage this week,
but they, will undoubtedly be able to
start this afternoon. 1t is expected
that the experience by the new men in
the opcding game will show up to
good advantage, '

The Pikers are also well prepared,
but they too, have had two star liner
men on the sidelines during the week,
saving them for to-day’s encounter.

Pikcl's Hliwc New Plays

The game will by no means he as
onersided ‘as the Washington—Grinncll
game last yea when the Pioneers
took the Pikcis into camp toathc tune
or 16‘ to o. The varsity had little
trouble in solving the Piker otiense
used by the preps in Wednesday's
scrimmage, but Wimberly and Davis,
the Washington mentors, were not
oblidged to open all ot their bag ot
tricks in the game against the noun
School of Mines last week, so, a closc
fought bottle to thc last whistle is
predicted. The Pikcrs have a new
coaching staff this season, and in
addition have a, slight advantage in
weight which will count materially in
wide)": mix,

Smile Lineup to Shut

Coach Elwsrd intends to start prime
tically the Same lineup as was used
Saturday. Taylor and Winter at ends,
Captain Nichols and Duke at tackles.
Wood and Dare at the guards, Grimes,
center, C. Kingery quarterback. Wing
and Critchett, haltbacks, and Sweet
at rollback. Scharnweher at end,

- Cathcart, who has been shined to a
guard position, and Smish at hair-
back will also undoubtedly get into
the game.

If a heavy tield marks the Pioneers’
bottle with the Pikers this afternoon,
ss seems probable, straight tootbcll
will be necessary and the beetier
Washington team will have a slight
advantage.

Course on a High Plane of
Musical Artistry.

FINALE, FROM “F‘AUST”
IS GLDVIAX 0F CONCERT

Artists Win the Audience With
Charm of Manner and Gan-
erous Encores.

Thc Cluchgo Operatic Trio appeared
Friday evening as the iirst number oi
the Grinuell School or llusic Recital
Course. A large and enthusiastic
audience iillcd Herrick Chapel and
recalled the artists iorpnany encores.

The members of the trio, lrcne Pav-
loska, Forrest Lamont and Virgilio
Lazzari, arc principals ot the Chicago
Ci ic opera Company and their pro-
gram contained sclections from the ~
standard operas as well as some
operstic novelitics seldom heard in
America. ' .

Vbriicd Progrmu Giieu

In the trio from Verdi’s "Atilla,"
rarely heard since its tirst perform-
ances at the Metropolitan Opera house,
the artists were at their best; Sel—
dom have "we heard a performance '
so exquisitely shaded and with such
a pcrtcct blending ot voices.

lur. Lazzari, tbc basso, pleased his
audience with the sprightly “Lu.
Calunnia," from "The Barber of Se-
\ille." His voice was very fine in
the upper register, with the lower,
tones rich and full. ‘

Mr. Lamont, the tenor, sang an aria
trom Puccini’s ”Tosca” with musician—
ly skill and a rare understaudiag ot
thc dramat iossilulitios at tho work.
His encore, a Venetian love~song was
received with great enthusiasm.‘

)indmuc Purloskn Wins Audience

Madame Pavloska cndcarcd herself
to the audience by her charming man-
ner and geuero‘us encorcs. The ia-
miliar “Habanern” from ”Carmen'“
served as an excellent vehicle (or her'
rich, warm, soprano. There was in
her Carmen a living, vibrant creation.
After being recalled many times Mae
dame Pslvcska sang Nevin's "Mighty
Talk A Rose,” accompanying herself,
She gave to the‘ simple melody depth
of feeling and haunting tenderness.

Miss Cir-lisle, an intelligent ad cap-
ablc accump'ttuist,nlayed as her tour .
dc iorce a brilliant paraphrase ot the
opera “Eugene Onegi Her encore.
a modern piece, “The Donkey Cart"
won much applause. '

The climax ot the concert was
reached in a splendid rendition . oi
the finale frum Gounud's “Faust",
Contrary to opera etiquette, the trio .
responded with a “repeat," touching
