The Gates Memorial lecturer for this
year, Professor Snailer Mathews, Dean
of the Theological Seminary of Chi-
cago. gave his second address on Wed-
nesday. His topic was “Social Aspect
of. the Doctrine of Christ."

Arc Ignorant of Theology Today.

Professor Mathews stated that
“Many things are regarded as now
while they are but a new interpreta-
tion of the old. Religion may be
placed in that class. The present gen-
eration knows little about theology
slnce scientiﬁc approach to answering
every question is now used The old
idea of God is still believed, that He
is like an old.

World. and that He is Sovereign "

source of interrogation. He is legardr

mic God, and has brought the theory

rights are the last thing that he should,

stand up for. and that smother man’s
rights should be ﬁrst"

Professor Mathews concluded hy‘
saying that "Through Jesus there is
revealed God as saviour", and in (1ro
ing the words of Christ he stated that
“Ye who hath seen Me, hath seen God."

Second Inter—Oceanic Waterway

Through Nicaragua Is Talked Of

President Harding’s administration

operation of the Panama. canal to the
construction of a new inter—oceanic
waterway, it was said yesterday by a
\Vhite House spokesman. The records
show a 50 per cent greater movement
of traffic through the canal than 3. year
ago. There is a steadily increasing

Mme Tillisch Gives Most Intel-
estiiig Entertainment
Last Night.

Dressed in the strikingly pic—
turesque costume of the women of
iSatersdatleu. Mme. Bergljot Tillisch.
Norwegian interpreter of folk music,
presented an unusually attractive
program Friday evening as the fourth
‘number of the lecture course.

Mme. Tillisch. who has spout
months among the peasants to get
the true Norwegian folk atmosphere,
explained to the audience that her
program would consist of old ballads
and folk songs current among the
mountain people, some of which have
never been transcribed but have
passed from singer to singer through
countless generations. Her ﬁrst group
of songs consisted of sagas gathered
together and written in the Norse
Icelandic language about the twelfth
Icentul‘yrrthe music of wandering
bands or skalds. who earned their
livelihood by singing in the great
halls of the cbioltains. Her ﬁrst
lmimber. "Iceland." was an old folk
song left in its original state which
represents the Norsemen sanding on
the shore of iceland singing of their
ilonging to go back to the old country.
lthe wondrous sagurland. The other
numbers in this group were tran»
scribed by sinding and Grieg. Two
give the primitive conception of the
value of the bard. or poetemusiciane
I"Happy is the one" and "I have
‘tried”—— the third is that of a wonder-
ing minstrel or minden singer. “I
gieet you my ladies."

In the second group Mme. Tillisch
ilnclllded folk songs of a later period.
Few countries. she explained are so
fond of their folk lore as the Nor-

egians who also place great empha—

s on exulcssion. In her interpreter
menu of these Norse songs llinc. Tillr
.i (‘11 save such dramatic presenta-
tions as in make the meaning of the
foreign words perfectly clear to the
audience. Before. singing her first
number in this group. “The Buy and
the Hillrlrc." she carcfully ricsnrilli’fl
ibis mythical being and illusti-atcd
ilic huldre dance. “The buldrc." she
said, "is a mystical. beautiful girl.

ifuily and gracefully but she does
lile the boys whom she entices out
into the mountains. A huldre differs
‘fl'om human beings in just one par-
ticular. she has a cow tail which she
tries to hide under her pctticoat. and
‘iis her petticoat is more than eighteen
yards wide she often succeeds."
Mme. Tillisch does not think it sur—
prising that the peasants believe in
these creatures in a country where
nature is so wild and fearful.

The second folk song. “The Tulla."
is the story of an old woman's loss
of her pet lamb. Friends have sug-
gested that this song may be sym-
bolical of the loss of a little daugh-
ter. but Mine. Tillisch who knows
intimately the primitive life of the
people and their intense love for their
animals believes otherwise. "The
Blueberry'l Patch." by Grieg, hel- poxt‘
number. was taken from sergeant
who is best known for his sad and
melancholy music, but who also
wrote some gems of lyric art. among
which is this song. in "Carl and

will increase, due to the upward trend
of business and the fact that the trans—
continental railroads have about all
the traffic they can handle.

Although the Panama canal has been
carrying only about 40 per cent of the
traffic it could carry, it is thought
that the time will come when greater
facilities will he needed. The adminis-

tration favors the construction of and

other inter-oceanic waterway to be
constructed somewhere in Nicaragua.
The canal rights already granted by
tbai country to the United states are
still valid.

the break-up of this pariey all hopes
of immediate peace in the Near East
have been given up and the Balkan
states are looking forward to a re-
newal of hostilities. This is evidenced
by the fact that Venizeios, former pre-
mier of Greece, has appealed to Jugo-
Slavia, and the other nations of the
littei enteute. for aid in the event that

.the Turks declde deﬁnitely that there

is no longer any chance of successful
mediation.
THE hm OCCUPATION.

France continues to push further and
further into Germany in an effort to
break the passive resistance of the
German people. In her effort to do
this France has deemed it necessary to
occupy territory lying outside the Ruhr
area. During the last twentyrfour
hours the Poilus have seized territory
in Baden to the right of Lorraine; the
city of Coddelau, an important nil-
road city in Hesse; and the city of
Mannheim. France has already spent
millions of fracs in ﬁnancing the occu-
pation of the Ruhr and has realized
$25,000.00 thus far on her investment
This sum was collected in the form of
taxes at Duisberg and Duesseldorf.

The game with Drake University
Monday night demonstrated to the
Pioneer fans that Grllmell is repres-
ented with a ﬁghting basketball team
which deserves the support of every
person on the campus.

Turning back a team which had de-
feated them on their home floor the
week before, by a very comfortable
majority, is no mean foat. This the
local boys were able to do against
Nebraska.

The game with Drake Monday
night was lost by the shot of a pis-
iol. When Benz made his basket in
coincidence with the end of the first
half. Grlnhell lost the two points
necessary for victory, as the final
score was 22 to 21.

Monday's game demonstrated an
apparent change of heart on the part
of the team. They went in determin-
ed to win. and stuck to that deter-
mination throughout the game. The
loss of the game is small in compari—
son to that.

point. The rural score was 22 to 21
aud at half time the count was 13
to 11, both in favor of the Blue and
White aggregation.

The game was expected to be a
rough and tumble affair. in v-iow of
the Des Muines contest, but the two
officials called closely and kept the
fouling well in hand. Two Drake
players. however. Van Aiken and
Gharrett. center and guard respecii-’
vely. were put out or the game early
in the second half on personal fouls.

Drake started the scoring with a.
pair of free throws but Benz then
made two free throws and a ﬁeld goal
for the ﬁrst Grinnell margin. The
same from then on see—sawed from
side to side. and the outcome was in
doubt until the final whistle was
blown.

Rip and Tuck Affair.

At no time during the game was
either team ahead more than four
points. The Bulldogs went ahcacd in
the second half by four points on goals
by Boclicr and Wilhelm. but this mar-
gin was. cut down by a pair of bus-
kets by Benz and Crltcbett

The game early developed into a
struggle between Benz and Wilhelm.
The outer players for either team
fed the ball into their hands, allowing
tbem to score for them. in this
struggle Wilhelm had the best of the
affair, scoring sixteen points. to
thirteen by Benz.
