France has been deserted by the flu-he

RECI’IALS

It is seldom that Grinlieli has a.
chance to hear a musician who is the

undisputed master of his instrument
We have such a chance next Friday
night when Pablo .casnls, ’cellist, sp-
pcars'in Herrick Chapel on the School

generally conceded to he the great

student should take advantage of
this opportunity of hen ng a real ar-

hear him.

The student body has turned out

ought to he packed, and that has not

yet been done. By no means has a

Music has played its part in the
world's history from the time or
David and Saul, and ages bclorc that,
down to the present The great inas—
tcrs ol the ages will live on the pages
or history forever. The music which
they have composed makes them ini-

music is recognized even by the hard

hear-iiig.and seeing the artist himself

music in the way that only he himselt

such recitals as we have here in G n—
ncll. '

The soul that is dead to music is
dead to almost everything else. The
world's thinkers and doers are great
lovers or ﬁne music. Strange as it
may seem, scientists are among those
who ai'e the most ardent enthusiasts.
