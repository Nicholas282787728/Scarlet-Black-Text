WORLD COURT IS TOPIC
DISCUSSED IN DEBATES

Debates In General ‘Are Close And
Some Excellent Work Done
In Contests.

Forum society, by winning both of
its contests in the interrsocicty dehat~
iug series, held last Wednesday and
Thursday, has taken a substantial step
toward winning again the Worth
Trophy, which is given to the society
which does the highest grade of work
throughout the year.

Iowan and chresio tied for second
place in the forensic titls; each will-
ning and losing a debate; while In.
stitute, with no varsity men on either
team, lost each of its contests.

The question debated was that used
in the varsity contests, “Resolved:
That the United States should enter
the Permanent Court of International
Justice under the conditions proposed
by President Harding.

In the first debate between Chres-
to’s affirmative, consisting of Rupert
Hawk, Jack Bender and Darrell Mai-—
ker, and humans negative, John Mc-
Gee, John Stehn, and Thomas Gould,
Ionian easily won their 3 to 0 decision
by their superior knowledge of the
question.

In the contest between Forun’s
affirmative, Paul Porter, Harold
Hicks, and Loren Reid, and lustitule
negative, Emil Bilharz, Bernard Crate
van, and Harold King, the negative
evidenced itsvinexporience by failing
efleetively to attack the case of the
affirmative, who Won 3 to '0.

This Thursday contests Were mark-
edly improved over those of the day
before. In Ithe tilt between Insti-
tute‘s affirmative, James Work, Don
Wilson, and David lyiccormack and
Chresto-s negative, l-iarry Reynolds,
Frank Dewey, and Lawrence Peder—
son, both cases were strong and opin—
ions ciashed Well. The affirmative
lost the vote 011 the single iudge be.
cause of their failure effectively to
organize their case.

In the final contest of the series.
between Ionian’s affirmative, John
McGee, Arthur.Bryant, and Howard
Whitney and Forum's negative, Otha
Weariu, John Talbott, and Eugene
hreitenback, the issues were perhaps
more clearly defined, and the clash
of opinion inove marked than in any
any of the other debates. The 2 to 1
decision of the judges testified to the
strength and effectiveness of the
arguments of both teams.

Annual Holiday Hop Holds
Xmas Festive Spirit With
Santa and Gripping Drama

The Grinneil merchants wondered!
Thc rush of traffic lncicoscd, Col-
lege students were doing their eleven
th hour Christmas shopping! One
bewildered citizen remarked, “But
Ch istnias (losen’t come until the
tweiltyvfifth," and the college youths
anil maidens wondered!

The storm upon the down town dise
tric‘t may he blamed upon the Senior
class of 1924. How could one help
think that “it was the night before
Christmas," if he had attended the
party in the Men's gym last night?
Breathing of the holiday spirit, the
well-worn gymnasium appeared to be
a gathering place for jollity and festi-
val occasions. A mass of red and
green streamers, bright lights dotted
here and there, and the inevitable
evergreen bearing striped canes, tin-
sel, and multitudes of dainty lights,
formed a perfect setting for the mellyv
making.

Commanders Scbnell and Smith
welcomed the oncoming enthusiasts.
l-lelen Schmeltz openud the program
by two wellechosen vocal selections.
But for the next number of the eye-
ning, even a reporter's pen could not
describe and do it justice. “A grip-
ping mellerdrammerl" Grinneil heads
should he held high today for they
have witnessed a production, differ-
ent, unique, in fact one which they
have pl'obably never seen, probably
will never see again.

“Wild Nell, the Pet of die Panlpus"
or “Her Final Sacrifice” adaptcd
from the book by Horatio Alger, “Recli-
less Nellie, or Did She do Wrong," is

a movie drama in two parts. The pro-

ducer, director, and manager, Mr.
Paul Clovis, when interviewed, stated
that “Last night‘s showing has been
the best since their three days run."

The drama featured, as Nell her»
self, Gilda Grhy van Garden: Lady
Vere dc Vere played by Naximova
Armstrong, Handsome Harry by Harry
Carey Henry. Sitting Bull, the Indian
Chief. by Harold Lloyd Nichols, stand—
ing Bull by Bull Montana Gillette,
and Hula Hula, the Indian Medicine
woman, by none other than stragg-
gling i-lare, supported the lead with»
out a flaw. Every character showed
professional ability, even to the heroic
deeds of Handsome Harry, the hero,
and to the terrible vilininy of Sit-
ting and Standing Bull. Nell herself
needs no mention here, hcr fame
has preceded her,

This touching melodrama of south-
West Arizona, was well received by
the appreciative audience. Loud guf-
faws were uttered, and the makers—
on swayed with unrestrained emotion.

Also the inevitable character, Santa
Clause, was there, after having been
delayed some moments, due to a brok-
en shoe on one of his l'eindeel's, Gifts
were bestowed upon dating Grinnellr
ians, some well received, others not
so well.

All in all, the evening was an enjoy-
zhle one, from the very beginning to
the last strains of “Home Sweet
Home.” And now that you have
paused long enough to discover the
cause for the onrush of searching
customers, you may return to your
Christmas shopping, freer of mind,
and lighter of spirit,

The Seniors beat the Freshman, 31‘

the Junior into camp to the tune of
22 to 13. This is the second consecu-'
utive year that the championship has
been held jointly by three classes.

“Hap” Moran was the outstanding
star of the series, and Captain Benz
showed his old form for the
short time he played. Harry Wing,
’25, proved to be the find of the series,
showing up exceptionally well at
guard, and putting himself in line for‘
varsity honors this season.

The Seniors had no difficulty in!

Chaso was their outstanding her-

WORLD PEACE IS

DUN LAP’S TOPIC

Urges Entrance Into League As
Means For World Peace.

"We should prepare for peace just
as enthusiastically and as diligently
as we ztre now preparing for war,”
declared Miss. Flora Dunlap of Des
iloincs in addressing the League of
Woman Voters at the Y. W. C. A.
rooms Wednesday evening. Miss.
Dunlap, who is head resident of the
Roadside Settlement of Des Moines,
has spoken at Grinneil before on
many phases of the woman's move
ment.

World peace cannot be attained,
Miss Dunlap believes, except through
some definite organization. The
World Court and the League of Na
tions, imperfect though they may be.
are two organisations already in
operation and still open to reser-
vations and amendments. Miss. Dun-
lap is impatient with the idea that the
American people in the election of
1920 declared theiusclves opposed to
the League.

'As a matter of fact, the mandate
of the whole couutiy showed that
the people believed cothher in the
League or a league, because both
parties in their platforms stood for
some sort of and association of no,
tron

Miss. Dunlap quoted Mrs. Carries
Chapman Catt and others who ro-
ceutly returned from a study of
conditions abord to show that the
other nations suspiciously regﬂl‘fl our
non—entrance into the League as an
indication that we are preparing for
conquest.

The next meeting of the League of
Woman Voters to be held on Jan-
uary 9, will discuss tho various peace
plans which have been presented for
public approval.

LEAGUE AND COURT NOT
CLOSELY ASSOCIATED

Personal Details and Anecdotes
Increase the Interest of Mar.
hing Address.

“The oueweason why we are not in
the League at Nations is partisan—
ship."

That statement, made by Ever-
committee of the League of Nations
Non—Partisan association and a mem—
ber of the Republican national com-
mittee in 1916-20, before a Herrick
chapel audience at eleven o’clock this
morning. carried with it an air of
authenticity. Introduced by Dr E,
W. Cross as a “practical pol lean,"
uhe speaker asserted that he saw the
opposition to the league organized un<
der his own eyes.

Anti-Wilson feeling, according to
Mr. Colby is playing a large part
in the opposition to America’s partic—
ipation in world affairs. He then
gave his own estimate or the ex-presi-
dent’s contribution to international
affairs as that "of making a, wouderiul
fight for an ideal,” and of making a
fight to realize that ideal though
concrete machinery.

Stepping out on the forward exA
tension to the Chapel platform that
had been erected for the “Messiah"
orator-lo, Mr. Colby spoke in a cons
yersotional manner that went far to
win the confidence of his audience.
Aided by a pervading sense of humor
and his personal reminiscenses of
international statesmen, he was able
to present an out and out advocacy of
the league and the court with out re<
sorting either to academic discussion
or emotional appeal.

After tracing the support which the
United states has given to the world
court idea in the past, and especially
the support which the idea has receiv.
ed from the Republican party, he pic<
tried the anamalous position of our
country through the mouth of the
chief justice of theworld court, who
once said to him: "After we do what
you told us to do. you won't come in."
"Politics," according to the speaker,
"is the only reason why we “won’t
come in.”

“This is the first time that we have
allowed partisanship to enter into our
international affairs," he continued.
And then turning to the more specious
objections to American participation in
the League and court, he asked' "How
long are you going to accept without
challenge some of the stuff that ap-
pears in your papers?" He stopped
here to pay a passing compliment to
several Iowa newspapers, “both morn-
ing and evening."

Alter outlining the work of the
court, he took up several of the more
prominent objections to American ad-
hercnce, squashing each one in turn
to the apparent satisfaction of the
greater part of the audience,

To the c ‘ cism that the court has
no power to enforce its decisions, he
replied that the United States Su-
preme court had no power, except
public opinion, to enforce a decree a—
gainst a state. He dismissed the ob-
jection that the court is part and par-
cel of the league by tracing the origin
of the court. "Elihu Root," according
to Colby, found the solution of the
problem that liaii baffled other at-
temps at a world court, that of se~
looting the justices, in the machinery
of the league of nations." A separate
treaty established the court and gives
it its aillliollty, however, he pointed
out. ‘

The election of judges through the
league is the latter’s only connection
with tho court which is cstnblishcd
and authorized by a separate treaty.
The direct implication which hir. Col~
by got across was that to object to
this irrangcmcnt would be to short»
fico thc one arrangement which has
made possible the selection ol judges
and would "drive the world hack
rcventy4ivo years into the past."

Turning to the league, he said,
“Whatever you may think of it, any
organization that can bring people,
