North and South America have been
closely intertwined for years, through
the natural friendly feeling which ex

by which the safety of the South
American republics has been assured.
The Conference,

in central America, and the United
States, has taken steps to weld the

EVOLUTIONIS'I'S DEFEAT BRYAN

The general assembly of the Pres-
byterian church, mccting in Indian—
apolis, went on record against the ex—
treme anti—evolutionary views of Wil-
,liam Jennings Bryan. The assembly
detected the commoners resolution to
bar schools permitting the teaching of
the evolutionary hypothesis from use
of church funds.

The meeting was no mild theological
convention—tho ﬁght over the evolu—
;tionary theory was one of the hitter-est
lthat has marked or marred the annals
oi the Presbyterian assemblies. Tho‘
brunt of the conﬂict was borne by Mnl
Bryan, who ridiculed the man to mon-
key theory and Mr. haer, a California
banker, who opposed the Coinrnoner's‘
stand. I

The assembly ﬁnally adopted a sub!
stitule resolution oifered by the Cali-
fornian which in mild terms advised
the church to withhold its otficial aDr
proval from educational institutions
where any teaching or instruction is
given whlch seeks to establish a ma—
teria‘llstio crolutionary philosophy of
life or which disregards or attempts
to disregard the Chn‘stian faith.

The ottcenth biennial convention of
the Iowa Federation or Woman’s
Clubs, meeting at Waterloo, has gone
on record tor peace by any possible
plan, “We want peace, whether,
through a league of nations, an arms
conlcrcnce, or a world court," says‘
the chairman or their new committee
on education for peace. ‘
