It takes something of a genius to
arrange orchestra programs that will!
be anticipated with equal eagerness'
by both the average man or the hot-
ener of some experience. Rudolph
Gnnz has an almost uucnnuy gift in
this direction, as is proved by the two
programs he has arranged ior the st.
Louis Symp-ln'ly Orchestra. and the
soloists, to give in Gl'ilmell Friday.

Radio and phonograph have made‘
orchestra composition much more
popular th'ln they lurnrerly were.
Thousands of people now “listen in"
on orchestra music lhro , 1 one of
these mediums or the other The 01L
Dortuhity to hear a great symphony
orchestra “itseli” is one that rairo
fans particularly will apprecra s {or
it will vas 1v increase their tutu
pleasure—this applies also to those
whose acquaintance with orchestra
music is as yet mostly through the}
records.

Three great overtures are included
in the two programs, the William Tell
overture with its uuaiut Alpine shen—
herd tunes, the storm. and the sti
ring march, at the aitcruoon concur .
two of Wagner's greatest overtures.
