WAIPIILE EXPHEBSES IIGermany Decides To Resist
French Occupation Of Ruhr

International Tangle Solved by
Anglo - German - American
Understanding Only. ,

FAMOUS N OVELIST STATES
AVERAGE ENGLISH OPINION

Discusses Problems of Day With
Utmost Frankness and no
Personal Prejudice.

That the solution of the European

political tangle lies in an AnglOrGel‘y

man—American undel‘smuding and
that things are moving toward this
end, was the opinion expressed by
Hugh \Vitlpole, noted English author.
in a personal interview, Saturday.

When asked to discuss the subject
of international politics, lilr. Walpole
declined to pose as an authority on
the matter but said that he only rep
resented the opinion of the average
Englishman. He discussed inter-
national problems of the day with the
utmost frankness and seemingly with-
out reservation or prejudice.

The English are very exasperated
with the French over their recent oc-
cupation of the Ruhr valley, accord»
ing to Mr. Walpole, and this feeling
has been constantly growing since the
war. Since the armistice, he said.
the French have not been wide in
their views, they have been national-
istic and unable to see the larger
points involved. with exception of
a few resctionaries represented by
certain newspapers Mr> Walpole
feels that the English are unitedly
opposed to the French action. As he
put it "The general concensus of
opinion is that the French are making
matters worse." _

In regard to the attitude of the
English toward the United States pol-
icy of isolation he said that of course
there was some bad feeling on the

part of the English but that it was‘

due in the main to their failure to
understand American politics. “Most
Englishmen do not know the differ—
ence between a Republican and a
Democrat; they are all the same to
them," he said. Mr. Walpole believes
that a reaction due to America's rev
pudiation of the idealism of Woodrow
Wilson, which took Great Britain by
storm, is a contributing tacmr to the
resentment which England feels to-
ward America.

When questioned on the English at
titude toward the new nonar Law
ministry he replied that it was meet-
ing the favor of the English people

The Berlin government ilzw decided
to expel all French civilians from
Germany and establish practically a
state of war against France, aside
from ﬁghting, according to a Berlin
dispatch yesterday to the Daily Ex-
press of London.

Talk on “Books and Friendships"
Proves Most Entertaining to
Large Audience.

Hugh Walpole, sun 01 the Bishop
of Edinburgh and author Of ﬁfteen
successful English novels well known
,in America. gave a thoroughly fle—
lightful talk on “Books and Friend—
ships” Saturday night at Herrick
Chapel as one of the interesting num-
bers of the college lecture course this
year. Perhaps a maiority of the sudl-
ence felt that Mr. Walpole’s talk ex<
‘ceeded in interest any other lecture
heard in Grinnell in as. time.

Mr. Walpole was introduced by
president Main as an Englllsbmsn
with American ideas and an Ameri-
‘can with English ideas, and not the
least of his notable dualities was his
American manner, thoroughly pleas-
‘ing in an Englishman. He L’tlked as
‘onc who loved to tell of his subject
and his personality was charming.
The lecturer had 8. Seemingly inex—
haustible supply of anecdotes which
pleased and amused his audience.

The lecture itself was in the nature
of an autobiography or ill. least. it was
marked by the autobiographical fear
tul‘e. Mr. Walpole ﬁl‘st told of his
childhood feelings toward books—of
bow he bought his ﬁrst volume and
enjoyed it even after he discovercd
upon completing the reading of it
that the book was none other than the

The controversial questions center—

Wyoming to the Sinclair interest got
investigating
committee late yesterday through pre»,
sentation by Harry F. Sinclair, ot the‘
offer made by him to the Mammoth
Oil company for the leasing contract‘
executed by Secretary Fall.

Mr. Sinclair, chairman oi the board
of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil cor-
poration, testified that net earnings
of his company from its organization
in 1919 to last June 30, amounted to
$22,384,000.

The offer made by Mr..Sinclair to
the Mammoth Oil company provided
that he should be given virtually the
entire stock of the Mamnioth on com—
pany in return for the lease he had
obtained from the federal government
through Secretary Fall. Questions by
the committee relative to the proposi-
tion were left until today’s session.

‘Pil-lky' Green, veteran forward ,and

The men Who will undoubtedly Start
the game will be Critchett and Gel—
Vin at forward, Fearing at center, and
Capt. Smith and Whitehiii at the
guards.

Cl‘ltchett is coming into form, and
should play his best game of the sea-

Mr. Walpole offered a mild exonerae
tion for the great horde who are not
interested in the arts, by declaring
that in the present day one has little
'timo to think while in the da e of

questioned the outcome of the i crease

According to Mr. Walpole, the true
personality and individuality of the
,author and his book can be best found
,in ﬁrst editions, but in any case
‘through books we can get the sense
or friendships that will never tail us.

Mr. Walpole’s lecture was thorough-
ly understandable to the general restl-
er, over whose head fcw of the spcalc
