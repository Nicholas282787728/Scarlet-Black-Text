THE JURISDICTION OF THE

COURT.

Attention is called. elsewhere in this
edition oi the Scarlet and Black to the]
ruling of the Court which provides‘
that its jurisdiction begins on Septem‘
her first and continues throughout the '
year, up (0 and including commence-
ment. That is, all men returning to‘
Gl-lnnell are responsible to the Court'
tor any violation oi the Senate regu-
lations which they may commit on or
aner Scptemhcr first.

The authority of the court is con-
the year. This
specifically includes vacations coming
between September first and com-
meucemcut. The Court interql'ets this
to mean that it has the power to not '
against all men who break any or the
Senate regulations during any vaca-t
tron.
and'columellcemcnt, which they may

tinuous throughout

coming between September first

spend, Wholly or in part, in Glinuell.

Furthermore, the Court has ruled
that its jurisdiction is not limited .to
misdemeanors committed on college
property, but covers all misdemeanors.
committed within the specilicd time '
limits hy all college men while in '
Grinnell, whether on or off the camp— ,
us. Moreover, the authority of the
court extends to cases which may
arise outside of Grinncll through vio~
lation or the Senate rules at on out
or town lotholl game or on other 0o»,

\ Gambling Equipment

A whole truck load of gambling par-
aphernalia was captured by city and
county Officers in a. raid on an im-
pruviseil gambling establishment west
or Grluneil on the county hue about
one o'clock Sunday morning. The
ti uck and all the equipment were
conlisicated and are now in the bonds
of the local police

The best part of the raid lies in the
tact that it was staged, partially at
least, at the invitation ol'the gamblers

Boyd was in Gmnell Saturday uld
while going ahout his business, was

was here to look in on the game to-
night.”

Mr. Boyd immediately got busy, or-

Chief of Police Manson, Shel-rill Greg’
‘son, Deputy Boll Gregson and several
miners, and visited the place where
the gamblers had been reported to
