COLLEGE SONGS

Eastern college and universities
ore in search oi new tunes tor their
college songs, as well as a hetter
class ol music for their glee cluhs.
They bewail the tact that tne‘stu-
dents, ho‘wever capable or writing
their own musical comedies and jazz
tunes, cannot get surdcient inspil‘av
tion to write their own college songs.

The students con all dance to jazz,
hut they don't care tor rallying songs
in toxtrot time.

The Yale song, “Bright College
