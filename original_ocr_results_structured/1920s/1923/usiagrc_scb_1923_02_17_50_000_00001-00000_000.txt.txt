open Forum Successful.

The open forum brought forth many'

interesting questions, aimed chieﬂy at
the stand which the teams took in the
debate. The dehuters answered the
difficult questions very satisfactorily.

The debate at Des Moines was very
hard fought,
according to reports, was very deﬁnite.

Both debates showed Careful prepm-A

there was clever work shown by the
four teams.

Benz has made a ﬁne showingI since

end of the ﬁrst semester. Although
‘Alle started late, and was at the bot-
ltom of the conference score sheet, he
has worked himself up to eighth
place, and promises to go even higher
before the close of the season.

The most dangerous man on the

Washington tcani, by far, is Minner,
their speedy left forward. in the
game with Ames last night Minner
scored every point made by his team,
shooting three ﬁeld goals and throw-
in‘g eleven free throws for a total of
seventeen Doiuts.
A Washington is new in a tie with
Drake University for third place, by
lll‘tue of Drake's loss of their last
night‘s game to Kansas by the over—
.whellning score of 41 to 11. In this
contest, Sparks, {l Drake substitute,
was the only man who could count
,for Drake, He scored three baskets

ed for Wilhelm, the‘ Drake captain.

Both tuilrenders of the conference
lllave now taken a fall out or Nebraska
University. Grimell was that ﬁrst to
defeat them, and the Kansas Aggie:
the last winning last night by a 17
hp 14 score. This gives the Kansas
Aggie team, a break into the Win cola
‘umn, and places them in a tie with'
Grinnell for the cellar honors.

forecast the rasult of the affair tos
night. Grinnell’s playing has been,
