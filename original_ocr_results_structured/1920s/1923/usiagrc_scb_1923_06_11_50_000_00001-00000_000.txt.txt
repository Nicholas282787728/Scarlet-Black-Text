bir Cross likened the power-
Christian lives to a icaven w
sprcads and gl'ous rapidly, declaring
the man whose life corresponds to the
nature oi things to be irresistible.
While the ieuven is sometimes hidden.
it cannot be lost according to the
speaker Whether in the mission held,
or in the small town or in marriage,
the indilidllai ﬁle does not lose its
penetrating power but a new ﬁeld is
opened up for its growth

it the Christian lives real to the
core and with the spurt of love in his
heart hc may penetrate the vastness
of evil and bring discordant humanity
under the sway of our thought, he
said in closing. i
