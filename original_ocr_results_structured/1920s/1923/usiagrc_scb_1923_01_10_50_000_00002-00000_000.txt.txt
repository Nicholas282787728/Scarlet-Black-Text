There are those who say that this

possible to dud a workable substitute

something out of nothing.

The college administration, the fac-
ulty, and the alumni and friends of
the college, have long desired to do
away with an organization like the
Oracle. The administration could at.
coy time‘ [lull the Oracle out or com-
mission ll it cared to do so. Its mile,
ore to do this hos been interpreted byl
some to menu that it is in favor of the
Oracle. We know this interpretation
to be unfair. We are inclined to loolr‘
upon the tnciturnity of the ddmi
trntion as being an evidence at its
unbounded faith in the ability at the
students to manage their own ottoirs.
