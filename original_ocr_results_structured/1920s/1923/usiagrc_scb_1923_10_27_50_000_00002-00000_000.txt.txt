GIFT GOODS

, Sixty-ﬁve Dollars a
Week for Powder Is
Quad Bill.

Froinwhat source springsths charm
n! the iair co—ed? Is it “that school
girl complection" or “Love’s Old
Sweet Song?”

Students have long searched for the
elusive answer. At least otter years
at imitloss questioning, a light has
been light/ed, A local druggist and
a beauty speclalist have revealed the
secrets or their cash registers,

For “the chsrm o: a skin you love
to touch," ousditos spend sixty-five
dollars a week on powders, rim
dollars or father’s hard earned sal-
ary goes out for marcelles and wav—
es. ‘

But the inﬂexible law at compensa-
tion cannot be forgotten. While the
quadlte struggles with band and hat
to keep the rain irotn destroying her
beauty, dormites spend twenty dol—
land a week zor hair oil.

It the tax on beauty soars any
higher, will the modern man dare to
mum, Will the fair cased be able
to support a husband?

 

 

Ward Field Named For Pioneer Athlete

Prior to 1892, when Ward field was
planned, most of Grinnell's athletics
were stage in the rectangular space
now known as the central campus—-
between Rand Gynasium, the Men’s
Gymnasium, Herrick Chapel, and
A. R. H. Here, in the spring and tall
respectively, baseball and football
were played. A tow benches and
precarious camp stools were the 01k
1:! available seats, and the majority
of spectators stood, with Spartan en»
uurance, from the beginning of the
galne to the end.

Track meets were usually held at
the Fair grounds, and were often run
in connection with old time oratnl-ical
contests.

The orgiuzil Ward field, which
Was planned in 1892, was located
slightly West of the present field. The
class of 1893 surrounded it with a
stout Wooden fence to discourage no-
paying patrons, and for their con-
tribution were granted the privilege
ct naming the field.

Their choice was Ward field, in
honor of Herbert Cl Ward, of the class
of 1890. Ward was known not only

as a good athlete—one oi the best
Grinnell had then produced—but a
good sportsman as well; and it
seemed to the class or '93 that his
name was more worthy than any oth-
er of being ncmsnently linked with
Grinnell athletics.

In 1395 a wooden grand stand was
erected, und d tew years later Charles.
Rawson donated a cinder track to re-
place the orginal dirt track, The
boundaries had hen changed during
the summer or that year, and the
field enlarged by ﬁve acres, an im-
provement which allowed the track to
be a. third or a mile long. it is in-
terestlng to mote that it was banked
at the curves for bicycle races. Prac-
tically all the work was done by
the college men themselves.

The old wooden fence wss tom
down about this time, and trout then
on there were continual minor im-
provements, until 1910, when the
iield was located on its present site,
and the concrete grandstand erected.
The classes of 1909 and 1910 pledged
$2,500 each, and the remainder oi
the money was contributed by the
