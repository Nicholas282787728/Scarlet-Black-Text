the action of the six Missouri Valley institutions witlr
drawing from the conference of such long standins is
that a reorganization of this conference has been impend»
iilg for some time, The schools have been of unequal
size, athletic calihre and equipment The action is “0th
ing more or less than an impolite \ of telling Drake,
Grinnell, Oklahoma Aggies and Washington that they
are not wanted,

What the schools should have done was to wait until
the Missouri Valley conference, which was to meet
December, and then thresli out the matter.

Grinnell is not so blind as not to recognize that on
the whole the competition in Valley circles is somewhat
too keen for a college in conipn on with a uniier. (3‘,

c in the beginning the library \\'t. not intended as a
social center, uhich may be startling news to many stu—
dents, or rather those who term themselves as such. An
examination of historical documents will prorc this trite,
but lest we get the rcputatinn or- it dispenser of radical
ideas, We will go on to explain.

The library is primarily a place to study, not a
reader 'olls or a qllietglook in which'to conduct a friendly
telerllrtete, it is rather disturbing to sit down at a table

with only a limited time to tlo some reading and to be‘

surrounded by a group of men and coeds sayin These
