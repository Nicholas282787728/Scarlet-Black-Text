"Rhythm, mole than anything, else,
is the [actor rcspcnslhlc [or such sucr
cess as I have had us it luothcll
conch." be \l‘l‘l‘leS in the October is-
sue of Popular Science Monthly. re»
vealiug how he has applied science to
football to ohtzlin his spectacular rc-
suits “Timed unison in thinking {illtl
acting gives cluvcu eager men on a
football tcaln an almost irresistible
advantage over another eleven that
has not learned to carol‘diuate the ac-
‘tions of individuals into team rhythm.
It is one of the most essential qua ‘
ties of a. successful football team. l
have proved this, time and again, dur-
ing my years of coaching at lawn and
at Dartmout ."

It is an engineering iact, he points
out, that eleven men, timing their mo-
tions with an exactness that enables
the eleven to hit the opposing line as
one man, can smash through much
heavier opponents with an ease that
would be utterly impossible if the
shock of attack were untimcd. unsyl'b
cllrollized. without rhythm.

“Possibly the best cxllnlpie oi the
value of rhythm in football 1 cm cm:
is a play made by Dartmouth in the
Chicago game last year. Dartmouth
kicked off to Chicago. Our ends, of
course, went down with the ball. A
Chicago player tried for it, but
missed. The hall struck his neadr
gear and bounded toward Sage, of
Dartmouth.

"Now rcmcluher, every Dal-(mouth
player was acting in ‘timerl unison.

Sage saw that break, klleu‘ that if lie
broke rhythm and tried for it be
probably would recover the bztll (or
Dartmouth, but he also knew that [lie
Dartmouth line was ‘thl‘ee or [our
strides behind him and that Captain
Parker was in unison and movement
with him. He would throw Parker's
playing all if he broke unison. By
count, Sago continued his play, which
was to get his man But of the way for
Parker, so the latter could get the
bztll and got away wlth it.

"Sage did just that. Rather than
break the perfect team rhythm, Sage
passed up the opportunity to grand-
stand. He uudoubtedly'could have
recovered the hall, and just possibly

might not have been downeli in his ‘

tracks. But he knew, without once
turning his head to see. that Parker
was in rhythm and that Parker would
he on the ball at the exact instant
Sage was blocking the Chicago play

ting into action.

“The result wits that Parker ran
thirty yards car a touchdown."

in the systematic planning of team
structure and development, says Haw,

hcrent qualities, listed in me order at

Courage, physical skill, and mental
capacity. The last item includes
ability to understand theory of plan
