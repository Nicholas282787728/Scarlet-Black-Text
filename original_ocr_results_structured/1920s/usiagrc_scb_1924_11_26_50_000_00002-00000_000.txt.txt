AN EPEOGUE

Since this middle of September we've
concentrated all our enhrgies and
hopes and ambitions on the Pioneer
gridiron Now that the

ended and the games We looked for-

season is

ward to have goine down in Gl'innell
history, let’s pause and count up our
football blessings before we go on to
haskotball,

Quoting from the Kansas city star.
in regard to the Andes game, “Evident~
ly Mark Hyland and Charlie Black
have amighty good team at Grihnell,
for they triumphed over an eleven
that beat the Kansas Aggies by four
touchdowns, Surely the season is a
glorious success at Grinnell.”

The host at it is that We can look
forward to next year with justiilahly
high hopes. Success no longer lins-
ors elusively ”beyond the horizo’h.“
The Pioneer brand or lootball can be
expected to improve as much next
year as it has this; and the time is at
hand when Grinnell my take her
place with the best teams in the Vulo
leyl ‘
To those who are responsible for
that state oi aflairs, we take it upon
ourselves to extend what we believe to
he the honest, hcartlclt thanks or the
entire student bodyﬁollr gratitude not
only to the coaches and the regulars
hut to every man on the squad. To
the men who have played their last
game or collegiate iootball. in par—
ticular, wooltcr our host wishes, and
our appreciation of their months or
training, a! the hours of hard grilling

labor they've spent on Ward Field. We
should like to‘ share with them
our sincere conviction that they have
not sacriticcd in vain—that the years
they've spent at GriunBll as Pioneer
ioothall players will prove to have
been a strengthening, uphutlding lu-
ilucncc not only upon Grinncil, but up

on themselves.

Leap Year Dance
Seems to Spell .
“My Opportunlty”

The days or anxiety are over, [or the
Leap Year Dance is a thing of the

anL No longer do the men hover‘

around the telephone or the women
pander at the other end at the line.

The men now know what it means
to endure that endless waiting, al-
though, sometimes, when the phone
did ring it was Duly Irene Castle or

Theda Bare. (Clark hall, in particular,

was IL favorite of Irene's.)

The dance itself went over big, The
girls even did the applauding, athougll
a few men occasionally chimed in IL la
bal‘u dance, with "More! More!" The
women delighted iu showing tho men
just how they Wanted it done, and the
men were equally willing to assume
the attitude Df “book me Over—I'm
her choice," V, l

However, the dance resulted
many humorous, perilous and pleasing
situations. For the majority of the
Quadrangle it. apparently Spelled “N"Y
OPPORTUNITY."

THIS is the otiiciul girl-day column.

Lion (higher 'u' higher till we can't see
earth) we are devoting our regular.
lull-sized column—20 inches, or 121)
ems—to the bettermcnt and protection
of Pure Womanhood (see Klan Krced:
sec. 7).

Girls, muchachas, filles, maidens,
ladies and others tailing into this cat
egory, the day is your'n. We haven't
seen the mahogany top of our desk for
two weeks owing to the inundation 0C-
casioned by n ruin oi some two hunr
dretl letters.

Sonic oi these stirring documents
were written on highly scented import-
cd llnsn, but the most or them were
scribbled with a trick hand on the
brown paper that contained the pork
chops ior dinner. However, tucy were
all of the salon ilk (a Scotch word pro-
nounced ilk. otten erroneously cm-
ployed, as in this case),

Here is the gist of what they con-
tained, or you can have it in a nut-
shell, if you prefer:
RECOGNITION AND OTHER JUST
DUES Now THAT WE HAVE BEEN
FRANCHISED.

THE FIRST LETTER We opened
wits from Blue Eyes who said sll‘e
thought the column was just too ducky
for soup and that she always read it
when she was moaning lor e ams.
Blue Eyes, our :tliswer to you i It

As WE HAVE a predilection iorthc

read the little message from Desperate
Liz, written on a millnyvszlcl: with a
rusty uail dipped in creosote. Liz.
whom we picture as a modest littlc
woman, said she liked the Doric so
MUCH that she didn’t know whether
to send us arsenic or music acid.

We received sixteen letters from
girls living in Cottage Three wanting
to know where they could huy Carn-
éls, or it they could secure any men
to act as purchasing agents. To this
sweet sixteen we must reply that it is
our ﬁrm belief that cigarette smoking
among women is nothing short oi sin,
chsapens a girl's character and brands
her as inferior specimcn or woman—
kind.
