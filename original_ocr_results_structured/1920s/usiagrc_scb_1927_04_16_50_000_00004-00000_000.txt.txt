To Cop Brown Derby

With but one week remaining rintil
the cover is laid for the annual grids
iron banquet, gl’cenrcycd politicians
nrc as thick on the campus as mud
puddles were a week ago, Their slip-
pery tongues ooze out propaganda res
splendent with ilowcrly atlpeetives,
while the candidates themselves sit
with feet upon their hac -, and he
tween drags on stogies, make artful
plans tor capturing the famous hrown
dcrhy.

This rurohtrusirc piece of felt is the
slllneet ol covctous glances from the
eligibles, those who rate the highest
grades, the clllssiest women, and the
most notoriety with the least, the
\‘e least possililc appearance of e.
ertion, Hap lloran, List year‘s win-
her of tlle hrown chapeau, has been
iiuriidatcd with letters from the can»
didatcs, all asking ioi- intormation
concerning Han's uncanny ahllity
along this line. Hap reports that
Skinny laruhn and P G. Nol ' are
the most worried of the hunch; Sloth
ny can’t figure out how to act like he
isn‘t exerting himself and Boz isi
afraid lIIS grades are too high,

Gordon Mcctor's clcctioncers have
already written his speech or accept
anee for him and Bill Crouch has just
obtained a haircut, to he sure that the
lid won’t he too smalL

Tlle hrown dcrhy is soon to he put
on display where the greedy ones '1!

tween the size of the hats hand and
the diameter of their own craniuriis.

All the boys are planning shaves,
shoeshines and pressed trousers for
the big affair, since there will be
many famous and prominent lowa
men seated allnut the hanouet hoard.
It is even hcing suggested that proper
etiquette will be observed while eat-
Ins.

The local chapter of the shavers of
the pen has induced Don Clark, a
Grinnell alumnus and iformer nation-
a1 president of Sigma Delta Chi, to
come and speak to the candidates for
the spring list and gloves .

Sigma Delta Chi‘s famous lie—goat
has been put on a. diet or spikcs and
old football slioes,.to insure that the
initiation of the new active and hen-
orer)’ memhers will contain quite a
kick.

After much deliberating and non-

said shovers, has deoidcd that water

The race is on! April 23 is the day
