on New Year‘s eye the mother in the

loaf of bread. Then she puts
the loaf of bread on the Wheat, and on
top of the loaf slic places a tall cane

the big vats where we keep our "rain
and provisions, and beside the plate of
bread and wheat she places a glass of
wine. In the night Saint Basil, who

to come to cat and drink and bless the
Drovisions.

No Gifts Christmas

"Another thing we do on New
Year’s eve is to cut an olive branch
and put an olive leaf on the charcoal
in the stove, and then makc a wish.
(The stove, Mr. styllanou explained. is
a pot in which charcoal is burned). if
the leaf turns over. our wish is grant—

“We give gifts on New Year's in-
stead of Christmas, and have quite a
strange custom in regard to them.
Youngsters go out on the street and
kiss people's hands, and everyone
whose hand is kissed must git-c the
child a gift of motley. Older people
kiss the bands of their elders. too."

laughing reply. ,

Church In Morning

Speaking of the Celebration on New
Year's day, Mr styliriiiou said. ”We
have church from 7:30 to 11, and em
tcr church the people gather in the
churchyard, cnibracing each other
and wishing ‘haDpS’ new year.’ New
Years is or course a holiday. and at
Christmas and Epiphany we have
three days' holiday."

The celebration of Epiphany,

rc-

is

a

six

' days after New Year’s day", is accom-

panied by a peculiar and interesting
custom. According to Mr. Stylianou,
“On this day the people fry it kind of
doughnuts, and throw a handful of
of them on their roof. In the night
it is supposed that the evil spirits,
knowing it is Epiphany, will then eat
these doughnuts and go away. We eat
them too, dipped in honey, but not un-
til we liavc given some to the oxen,
that they may eat the fruits of their
labors in the field.“

Christmas in America. is apparently
not easily substituted for Christmas in
Cyprus, for in concluding his des—
cription of the holiday in his native

a great deal."

The supposition that the interview

Professors who still w id ten-pound

of their lives in such snappy stator
luents that the novices clutched their
pencils and held their breath.

Far be it from any of .thcsc innocent
journalistic apprentices to suppose
that the faculty is about to pass from
this “vale of tears.” Far bc it from
these timid questioner-s to willfully
pry into the private life or their in-
structors. It was assigned. and true
to the trust of their profession, they
went out after the “dope." It is sin-
cerely hoped by the interrogators that
the faculty members who were asked
what year they irst saw daylight will
forget and forgive as the holders of
this information will do. it is earn»
estly promised that such valuable in-
rorniatioii as the size collar they wear
and their statement uf preferences in

lhali as has been customary, and the
time limit will be three hours instead
of two hours.

Chapel will be held at 9:00 a .m.
during examination days and e. minor
.tions will start at 0:20 a. m. il‘nine»
dintely following chapel. The sched-
tile for examinations is as follows.
