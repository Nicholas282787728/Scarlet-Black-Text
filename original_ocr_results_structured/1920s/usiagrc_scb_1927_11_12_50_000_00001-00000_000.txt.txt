MUEIE l DELIGHT,

Is In Itself Sufficient Reason
For Attending Recital In
Chapel Wednesday.

HARPSICHORD IS POPULAR

Says Brittleness, Pungency of
Tone Take On Sharpness of
Steel-Point Etching.

Ily G. Hrrbcrt Knight.

(Editor Note. Dr. G. Herbert
Knight, professor of organ and come
posltion ill the School of Music, was
formerly music critic for the Balti-
lnol-‘e SUN.)

When olle was listening to Mme,
Wanda Lillidowsllzl’s playing of the
harpsichord in tile Herrlck chapel on
Wednesday evening, _thel-e was but lit-
tle disposition to consider what kind of
all instrument she was playing, what
kind or a performer she was, to
analyze this or that, what sort of an
interpretation slle was givillg or what
tlle nature of the artistic personality
was tllat was accomplishing the per—
formance. What one did feel was a
constant inclination to delight in the
old~world mllsic itself, to listen to it,
to ﬁnd it an ftllrsufflcient reason ior
attending a concert departing far from
the routined plan of the average con-
cert artist.

Such Concerts Few.

Certain it is that few such concelts
can be heard in this music- loving land
of ours, and it can also be conceded
that there are but few musicians cap—
able of realizing artistic ideals as
Mme. Landowska realizes them.

Mme. Landowska's skillfully de-
signed program included a Handel
Passaeaglia, J. s, Bach's Italian Con-
certo, D. Scarlatti's “Sonata" and
Couperin’s “Les Fastes de la grande et
Ancienne Menestrandise,” When pub-
lic performers play the olavier pieces
of Bach, Handel. Courerin and Scar-
lstti as the composers wrote them and
as it was intended they should sound,
then they are found to be a source of
sheer delight, of intense musical
charm, as they were indeed on Wed-
nesday evening. There was nothing
thunderous about them and but little
to tempt the prowess of the great vir-
tuoso, but they did demand the most
subtle technical power and the most
complete identiﬁcation of the artist's
moods with those of the composer.

Audience Partial to Kmsichord.

The large aduience attending the
concert soon convinced Mme. Land-
owska that it was partial to the
harpsichord—not merely because of its
novelty in these days, but because of
its peculiar effectiveness. Its brittle
and pungent yet always appealing tone
fascinated all alike, end its clarity and
variety of utterance was such that all
the scintillating Scalerpassages, are
peggi and ornamental groupings em-
anating fronl it took on the clear and
“sharp outlines of all etcher's steel—
point engraving.

The enthusiasm of the audience for
Mme. Landowsku's playing was so
warmly expressed on many occasions
that the artist graciously added seVr
oral encore pieces to the printed list,
and these, together with tile items in
cluded in the formal program, blended
well enough together to satisfy all
tastes and to provide a concert long
to be remembered by music student
and layman alike.

Harvey Ingham To
Talk Here Sunday

Editor Des Moines Register Will
Discuss European Relations
At High School.

Harvey Ingham, editor of the Des
Molnes REGISTER, will Speak on
“European Relations,” in the Grin-
nell high school auditorium at7:30 this
Sunday evening. Mr. Ingllam appears
at the invitation of various Grinnell
organizations which are holding a
meeting to celebrate Armistice day.

The editor's speech will be based on
his recent experiences, abroad where
he went as one of a group of American
editors chosen by the Carnegie founda-
tion to study European problems.

Mr. Ingham is recognized as one of
the Middle West's leading spokesmen.
Last year he was active in attempting
to secure farm relief and visited Wash-
ington to urge the passage of the Mc~
Nai~y»!<lallgen hill. He has also been
one of the leading advocatbs of inter—
national peace. Exil-acts from his edie
torial page dealing with both fol-in re-
lloi and international conciliation are
quoted frequently in large Eastern pa-
DEI‘S.

Mr. Ingham was educated at the
University of Iowa where he gained
prominence as an intercollegiate de-
bafcr. After graduating he became
editor of the UPPER IOWA REPUB-
LICAN, which became one of the lead
ing Weeklies of the state, In 1902, \‘l

Mason Will Explain Civilization
Of Old Yucatan In Second
Lecture Number.

Following closely on the foot-steps
of Captain John B. Noel, who describr
ed Mount Everest, lecture course pn-
troris will be transported to another
region of the world when Gregory Mae
son. appears in the Congregational
Church on November 18 to tell of “The
Lost Cities of Yucatan." Ml‘. Mason re-
cently returned from this Central Am-
el‘lcan territor where be investigated
the lost civilization of the Mayas.

Leading a party of live scientific ex-
perts, Mason spent two months ex-
ploring a region which had not been
vlstied by white men since the original
Spanish invasion in 1527, and through
his research he unearthed the start-
ling information that a civilization
much like ‘our modern machine-run
life once existed there. Elaborate
waterways and land routes, large hare
bars. and Strong fortifications all
contributed to the prosperity of this
strange people. Their elaborate lang-
uage contained many words found in
Greek, Sanskrit, and Chinese, Suggest-
ing the explanation that some bond
connected them with the fabled island
of Atlantis, which sank beneath the
sea 11,000 years ago,

Art . tie Temples Found.

At any rate, the temples, mllral
paintings, and pottery of the Mayaus
compare very favorably with anything
produced in Egypt,

It is even probable that this ancient
culture flourl. lied in the "New" World
before the age of the Pharaohs dawn-
ed. Civil war, invasion, or disease unr
dermined the Maya state, and when the
Spaniards arrived it had fallen into
decadence. Ruins of 172 cities have
since been found, indicating that at
one time the density of population was
greater than what now prevails in
China.

The miracle is that with these im-
pressive relics at the very threshold of
the United Statics, so little is known
of them. Gregory Mason, in his ad-
dress, will use colored stereobticon
pictures, bringing the infinite detail of
craftsmanship vividly before his 5}.“le
lence.

vited to attend lodge while in Grin-

MEHK STHTSSES BASIN
IN TALK [TN MUHMUNS

Says Region Adapted to Working
Out Eperiment; Traces
Work of Smith.

"The Great basin is particularly
adapted to a people wllo are working
out it 'new experiment and \viult isola—
tion,“ said Pl-oi. Frederick Merk in a
lctuce on “The Great Basin and the
Mormons" in the A, R. H, auditorium
Thursday evening,

"The Salt Lakc region is a basin
with no outlet," he said, “The moist-
ure that falls in it never reaches the
son, It is a region or absolute or
semi-nl-idlty. While the lack of rain-
fall is the great llfllldlcnp of this
province, it is also its great salva
Lion. With a change in climate, it
would be drowned,"

Tile soil poor and alkaline. scat-
tered over with sagebrush and a little
bunch-grass, hierk stated. The one
habitable place in tllc basill is the strip
of land lying at the rootorthe Wasatch
mountains and watered by mountain
streams. The population of this dis—
trict is made up largely of Mormon
emigrants from New England.
Smith has Vision.

“Joseph Smith, the founder of the
licrlnon faith, was born in Vermont in
1805," Professor Merit said. “He
came from a neurotic family. His pal-—
cllts moved to Palmyra, N. Y., while he
was very young. He had his first vis-
ion at the age of fifteen. He was
praying in the woods when two angels
appeared on‘ a pillar of light and told
him that the Nelv York sects were not
true to tile gospel. In a later vision
the angels revealed to him that under
a hill near Palmyra were some golden
plates, containing the one religious
truth. He received them from the
angels and wrapped them in blankets,
for he had been warned that if another
human being saw them, he would be
struck dead. Joseph Smith translat-
ed the heiroglyphics with the aid oi
the crystal spectacles that came with
them, while ilartin Harris wrote the
words from his dictation,

“It was then revealed to Joseph
Smith that Martin Harris should mort—
gage his farm for money with which
to publish the book." In 1329 the Book
of Mormon was printed, It tells of
how two of the lost tribes of Israeli

came to America, and when one groupl

was almost cxterminated by the other.
the survivors, Mormon and his son
wrote the great truth upon golden lab-
lets and buried Them under the hill.

"The Book oi Mormon, the Bible.
and the Doctrine and Covenants of
Joseph Smith and Brigham Young
make up the sacred books of the More
moi-is.

Issues Paper Money.

“Joseph Smith was baptized by John
the Baptist, and founded the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints."
the Harvard lecturer continued. ‘Vith
his many followers, he moved to Kirk-
land, Ohio. Here he issued paper
lnonev to cover the debt on the teln-
ple which he built, and in the panic of
1337 was forced to leave with his
flock.

“The people OE Missouri, where the
sect lived next, disliked the Mormons,"
asserted Professor Merit. “They took
no stock ln revelations that were not
Baptist or Methodist revelations. In
the dead 0E Winter in 1839, they drove

College Observes
Armistice Friday

Devotes Chapel to Playing War
Songs, Speeches, Prayer
By War Veterans.

“War fails to solve the complex is—
sues of modern life; it destroys the
idealism of man; it is ullllnlllan. We
must therefore undertake to build a
new world in which mankind shall not
place such faith in the efficacy of
iorcc." In these words Dr. Frederick
llcrk, Harvard exchange lecturer, au-
dresscd a large audience of Grillnell
facility and students, resident or the
city and members of the American Le-
glon and G A. h at a special Armistice
day long chapel yesterday morning

AS a prelude to the program, H. W
lintlack played on the organ a medley
of war times. Following tl , Dean J.
r. Findlay contrasted briefly the gath-
ering yesterday and that on a similar
occasion llinc years ago mecting to
celebrate the close of tllc World War.
Mr. T. J. Noll represented the G. A. R.
by reading a passage from the scrip-
tul-cs. ,

War Full: Ill Purpose.

"Though war may have settled some
of the simpler issues of life, such as
dlsputcs over tel ltory,” stated Dr.
ilcl-k, after a eulogy to the soldiers of
the Civil and World wars, “it. has (oil-
ed to solve such greater questions lls
slavery, for which the Civil war was
fought, or to do away with militarism.
the problem which the World war
songllt to abolish."

The superﬁcial aspect of slavery, the
speaker pointed out, may have been
remedied by the Civil war, but the
race problem remains. The southern
white could not conceive of the negro
as his economic, social or political
equal—the physical differences were
too great. Freeing through war a
class whom the white considered in-
[erior only increased race feeling,

On the other hand, if slavery had
been left ior a generation or two in
the south, decline in soil fertility and
other economic factors would have
brought (than! its death. Peace Could
have done much thiti. war did not.

"As for the results ,of the 'World
War," asserted the speaker, “one look
at the armies and the navies of the
world today will show how little the
most terrible Conflict ever Wltnessﬂl
did'to rid society of such mllltarism as
was embodied in German, French and
Russian political policies before the
war.

War Brings Exhaustion.

“Wa‘r too, brings spiritual exhaus-
tion. As business, politics and social
life were at a low moral ebh after the
Civil war. so are they all over the
world today. The tide of human emo»
tion is burnt ollt in the fiery furnaces
of war.

"If this institution of war is to go,"
concluded Dr. Merk, "a new world
must be built, which will necessarily
involve the remaking of human nature.
the surrender of narrow nationalism,
and the creation of an international
mind. In this building. Americans,
realizing that whether they wish so or
not this country is bound to the rest
of the world by unbreakable economic
and political ties, must lead. Standing
in the presence of the ten million dead
of the World war, let us resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain!"

The Rev. R. J. Montgomery of the
American Legion concluded the service
with a prayer.

TTIBBLE WINS HAHTTTEH
TITLE LAST THURSDAY

Phillips Comes In First to Help
Place Courthouse Building 4
In Dorm Lead.

Dibble annexed the intramural cross—
country race on Thursday afternoon
when runners from that house finished
in first, second, and two tying for
fourth. Captain Johnny Phillips, the
winner, repeated his performance of
lost week‘ in winning the individual
honors, finishing a hundred yards
ahead of the other runners.

The barriers started their race from
the north end of the dormitories, con—
tinuing own the road to the country
club, around the third green and back
tor one lap around the Ward field
oval, finishing in front of the grand
stand. A large group of students \vltr
nessed the finish of the race.

Phillips led from the start, never

being headed after the first few yards. \

Bauman, Dibble, who) took second
place, after Secor, Langan, was dis-
qualified, ran a fine race. his first at
the distance. A wide space separated
Bauman from Curtis, who was third
place winner, but the contest for
third and fourth resolved itself into a
fight as soon as the three men, Cog-
gesball and Mark from the judicial
building, and Curtis pulled unto the
track. Curtis distanced his rivals, who
sprinted to the tape a few yards in the
rear in a dead heat.

Winning both the speedball
cross-country events places Dibble
hall in a commanding position in the
intramural standings, giving them a
lead of over a hundred points.
