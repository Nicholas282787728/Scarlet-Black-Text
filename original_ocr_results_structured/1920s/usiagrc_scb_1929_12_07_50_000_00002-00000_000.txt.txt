WHAT FRATERNITIES OFFER

Grinnell has often claimed that because of the
absence of fraternities from the campus this school has
sister
schools with their Greek letter social organizations Yet

had a more democratic spirit than have her
there are many features of fraternity life that Grinnell
might incorporate that would add to and refine that
spirit of democracy which we are proud of.

Grinnell could. through its dormitory units, he more
courteous to visitors. It is some‘whetdisconcerting to
be nominally a guest in a strange college community,

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

out Grinnell students who have had occasion to visit at
fraternity houses in other schools are a witness that
fraternities are past masters in the art of making a
visitor feel at home. and have often wished that the
same spirit could he evidenced hy the rcsdents of a
dormitory when visitors come here.

Most fraternities enforce strict quiet. hours, recog-
nizing that their ohservance is a sign neither of cle-
generscy nor of lack of sophistication, but that, as
sophistication is the ability to do the right thing at the
right time. observance of quiet hours is rather a Sign
of that characteristic in a person.

Then, too, what Grinnell student is there who has eatr
en at. a fraternity house who has not enjoyed the cul-
tured, courteous atmosphere prevailing there, the leisure
l taken by the men, giving them an opportunity to discuss
their common problems and achievements of the day?
And who has not compared such an atmosphere with
the mad scramble of dormitory dining ways?

Grinnell's democratic spirit is commendable, hut
adoption of these three things would certainly add to it
and refine it, as we suggested at the beginning of these
remarks: more friendly spirit to visitors. stricter observ-
ance of quiet hours, a more deliberate and cultured at-
(itude in the dining room. They are the contrihutions
which the fraternity system holds out to Grinnell stua
dents who are anxious to improve the reputation of

their college both in the college and world of affairs.
