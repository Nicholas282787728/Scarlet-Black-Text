Nancy and Her Third Husbands
Furnish An Evening of Pleas-
ing Comedy.

.Thei'e‘ll be a

Never have we seen an amateur
cast suited to their parts than those
in' "Husbands 0n Approval," the
freshman farce presented last eve~
hing. Kathryn MCAlister in the role
of Nancy Glover made a beautiful and
charming heroine and carried her
part in a very admirable manner.
Robert Berry, as Bob Devlin, her leftd-
ing suitor, did his part well, display-
ing the restraint necessary to ban
mice the varied temperaments of his
tin-co rivals. ‘ '

We crown D vid Z\.c"nriill("4:r
Fitzgerald) with a wreath of simm-
rocks, as the laughter king of the
evening. ,His blarncying hrogue and
his immense concern over his favorite
dish of corned beef and cabbage pros
vided the audience much mirth. Mar-
garet Nichols, as Rita Glover, shared
honors with Mr. McCurnnck, Her
moods of "l'enfant terrible” variety
furnished some of the best comedy in
the play. We realize that this sort
of role always makes a hit with the
audience, it! properly done, but in this
instance we believe every possibility
was Canahly brought outby the Nich—
ols McCornaek duo.

As for the rest of the cast, Eleanor
Selby (Mrs. Glover and Willlbni 111' -
ler (Col, Rowe) handled rather dif-
ficuit roles inn pleasing way ‘and
Frank Miller (Hamilton Seaver) did
a commendable bit after coming in
"all mussed up” in the third act, Mary
Mittlaek as Katherine; Robert Rich—
ni'tlson, as Snm’ Glover: and Donald
Brown, as the Boy played in a very
acceptable manner And We must not
forget iryron Burt (Kl'zitz) who was
the cause of several sidesplittibg
laughs.

Much of the success of the play we
‘are led to believe, is due to Frolessor
”Whiter H. Truinbancr, who is par-
ticular successful in the directing ot
coined,

We realize the‘ handicaps which are
{ill ever-present evil in presenting a.

Railway, acting commissioner of‘Fof-
cign Affais, commissioner to the In-
ternational Plague conference at Muir»
den, minister of post and communica-
tions in tile first Republican Cabinet
of China and officer of ceremonies.

in 1914. during the trying war per:
ind, r. Sze was sent to Great Brie

{ice until 1321. He was also the dele-
gate of China to the Peace Conference

ary and Minister Plenipotentiary to

ese government he also served as the
chiel Chinese delegate to the welsh-
ington confeirmce on the Limitation
ot Armaments and the. Pacific Far—
Eastern questions, .

On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Sze will
conduct a round table for students
and other interested persons at which
