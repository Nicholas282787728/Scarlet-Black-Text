.Fans were treated to a thrilllng
football game between Grinnell and
Creighton at the Western League park
in omnha Saturday, the Catholics
winning 13 to a.

Long runs seemed the order oi the
day, the most exceptional being by
Mahoney, when he shook off the en~
tire Grinnell team in his spectacular
dash for seventy-five yards and a
a touchdown. Sweet, however, tied
with him for honors as be several
times broke loose for long runs and
tore off yardage every time he took
the pigskin. 0n the first play of
Grinnell’s offense, the tlashy halfback
stepped off thirty yards through the
line, and repeated on the next dovm
with fifteen. Wing and Moran alter-
nating at fullback shared honor-s for
Grinnell, with Lower and Keane divid-
ing them for Creighton

First Quintet Even

The rivals battled on fairly even
terms the first quarter, neither team
threatening seriously to score altbo
they each made four first dorms this
period. The second quarter started
with Sweet taking the hall for six
consecutive times, and making twenty
f '9 yards through the line, Late in
this period, with a minute to go be-
.fore the end of the half, Keane grab»
bed a twenty yard pass from iiaboney
and raced lhe remaining distance for-
a touchdown. iiahoney booted a (ll-one
kick for the other point and the half
ended Creighton 7, Grinnell 0.

Printing Dual

The third quarter settled into a
punting duel with the honors fairly
divided, but Mahoney caught one of
Moran’s kicks on his twenty-five yard
line and side-stepped through a wok»
en field for a touchdown, putting
an end to the even tenor of things,
However, the game from then on was
a thrilling battle with the Pioneers
striving desperately to score. The
last quarter saw the ball change hands
fourteen times and it was driven,
passed and run from one end of the
field to the other. Grinnell tried
pass after pass but the Catholics
proved too adept it the aerial defense
-and only two were completed. Both
'teams were within scoring distance,
the Scarlet and Black seriously threat
ened to count when they had the hall
on the five yard line, but a pass was
grounded behind the goal line and a.

Basketball practice officially starts
next Monday, and with the major por-
tion ot last year’s varsity squad back,
land a wealth of new material report
ing, Grinnell faces one of the most
promising basketball seasons in years.

Captain Gelvin, Winter, Wing, and!
huge. all of whom held down varsity
berths last season, and J. stotts who
got into several games last year, are,
the veterans reporting. A galaxy all
stars from last year's prep outfit have,
also beeir working out under the Intel
clagc of Coach Black. Among these;
are Moran. Buffing, captain of

last
year-ls preps, Chase, Larson, W. Stotts,
Larson, Gates, Bradstreet, Hays, and
Nihlo. Lamb, a promising forward.
who entercd school the second semese
ter last year, will become eligible for
Valley competition at the close of the
first semester.

‘ First (inure With K. U.

An attempt is being made to scl'iulr
ulo two games before the official Vale
l‘oy schedule opens, but as yet noth-
ing definite has been arranged, as
to whom and when the Pioneers will
play. Tire official iiissourr Valley
schedule opens for Grinnell with a
home game with Kansas U. on Janue
ary eighth. Kansas, the Valley champs
last year, has lost practically the
entire personnel of last season's
first string, and Dr. Allen will uhe
doubtedly place on the court a grerr
er and more inexperienced five than
has represented Kansas U. in recent
years, so a win in the first game for
Grinnell would furnish the morale for
the balance of a most promising sea-
son.

Business Club Hears
Industrlal Secretary

Mr. Russell McCarthy, industrial
secretary of the Des Moines Y. M. C.
A., spoke before the Business Club
Sunday afternoon in the Dibble hail
Clllb-l'oom‘on “Personal Relations in
Industry."

]\[l'. McCarthy, who recently attelifb
ed the Eastern industrial Conference
at Silver Bay, New York, stressed the
two main ideas that were discussed at
that conference; namely, (1) import—
ance of bumftn relationship in indus~
try, (2) unemployment. The import-
nce of human relationship in industry
is exempliﬁed by the international
Harvester Company plan, wherein a
standard personnel department is
maintaine dthr-oughout their 12 facto-
ries. The functions of this depart
rncnt embody employment, safety,
health and recreation. Then there is
the union i)lfiil.n'l.1icll features the rec—
ognition of unions, protective coli—
structive union powers, cooperation
for improved public service and dis—
tribution of profits.

Unemployment for the last ﬁve years
has become an acute problem in busi»
ness conditions. In fact, it is estimate
on that there is unemployment 30 days
a year for the average employee. Big
industries hire and fire an amazing
number of men each year.

Mr, McCarthy cnrphasizcd two out—
standing qualiﬁcations of a young man
entering the ﬁeld of personnel mini»
ugement today. In the ﬁrst place, a-
good back 'Clulll such as a college ed-
ucation is universally in demand; and
