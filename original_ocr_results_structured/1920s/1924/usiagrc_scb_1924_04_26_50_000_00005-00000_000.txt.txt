Quintet of Local celebrities Is
Granted the Privilege of
Speaking Tonight.

1924.

Although we have always felt that
oratory is as much out of place ill an
assembly or journalists as il/ written
examination in a speech course, so
many or our prominent citizens lime
requested that they be permitted to
undress us this evening that We can
do nothing but how to their desire.

For the protection of all concerned,
each speaker has been all‘llsmi to con<
fine his remarks to twentyrrive or
thirty minuts. ll anyone of them
(ztkes longer than that, the manage—
ment will pay for the broken dishes.

Mr: is E Hinsllaw Billlnrz. We un-
derstand that he is catalogued at the
Quadrangle as “that good-looking and
romantic Mr. Bilharz," Further than
that he enjoys an enviable reputation
within our college walls, as they say
“Bill" is billed
to lsspoud to the toast “Features."

If the applause subsides so We can
continue, Jessie Baldwin is booked to

'ﬂlScuSS a eminently timiely topic. “The
:Dﬂle Lin-o." We do not need to stress
iNﬁss Baldwin's qualiﬁcations to dent

with this suhj8ctvshe will speak for

lhel-selr. We might mention what perv

bans is not generally known, that Miss
Baldwin has recently been elected a:
life member of the College Press club,
the Women'sAPrESs club's only rival.

The next victim is R. Burdett‘e
Plotts. or Burdle, as he is sometimes
called. Mr. Plolts gained his ability
to sell advertising to Grinnell mer-
chants from his experience in taking
orders for correspondence courses in
home economics throughout the Can-
nibal Isles. We understand that he is
specializing in Jurisprudence and An-
tedeluvilln Astronomy with the idea of
opening a string of self-serve jewelry
stores in Omaha, Sioux City and other
