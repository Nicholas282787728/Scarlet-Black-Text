Lectures by Russell and
Slosson Ate Off.

"Turning back the clock. six million
years" will be the task attempted by
Arthur Sten’y Coggeshall, director of
education of Carnegie museum, when
he speaks in Herrick chapel next
Saturday night. January 28, on pl‘e-
bistoric life as he has found it by
personal discoveries all over North
American and especially in the VVest-
eru section.

Pictures Used

Mr. Coggsball has made it his aim to
put his discoveries in a form which
can be comprehended by unscientific
audiences and with this end in View
has made huge models of the prehisa
toric life which he has discovered, has
arranged them by a series of pic—
cures 50’ that they appear to move,
and by other devices has endeavored
to reproduce the history of periods
millions of years ago so that it will
be vividly portrayed to the twentieth
century homo sapiens.

The lectures which were scheduled
for Bertrand Russell and Edwin slos-
son have been cancelled. Mr. Rus<
sell is confined in England with an
attack of pneumonia and Mr. Slosson
has had conflicting engagements and
has canceled all his speaking dates.

Punishes An Evening of Good
Music, Though Laolnng in
Professional Finish.

Fllth THE GHITIGS GHAIR

With commendable courage the
Grinnell College orchestra chose a
program that was vaﬁed and difficult,
Last night in Herrick Chapel. they
finished their concert with a smile.

There was adequate cause for re-
juicing; with a minimum of experience
and a program which was a bit too
ambitious the orchestra achieved ef-
fects that were surprising,

unfortunately, as is the case of
lnost similar organizations, the young
players had no reserve. They played
evenly, at times with monotonous pre-
cision, but they were unable to reach
the heights. We waited for tonal ef<
footer, for climax. but there was none.

Prof. G. h. Pierce conducted in his
even, efficient manner—he is not giv.
en to mannerisms, for which we are
thankful. He found his musicians
responsive; their attack and release
excellent. The mass effects were
good. although marred by occasional
dissonances.

The violins were especially fine and
were heard to good advantage in Dell—
bes' hallet music. It was in the last
composition in this suite that the
players found themselves; here they
played with vigor and charm.

Mr. Arthur Faguerote contributed
8. “Prologue" which was distinctly dif-
ferent, and entirely satisfying. His
enu‘nciauon is worthy of mention; for
it is a rare gift he has of making an
audience understand his songs.

in their attempt to furnish an eve<
hing ut cnioyahlc music the orchestra
was eminently successful. That the
players are versatile and accomplished
we have no doubt. We hope they
will offer us another program in the
spring when they will bavc profited
by their past performance. We have
just cause for being proud of them, of
their director, and of their honest ei-
fort to give us the best of music.

Befcrc many years the great annual
English derby isn't going to have any-
thmg on good old America. The first
national derby was celebrated in a
suitable fashion last Tuesday when
about thirty Gl'iunelllans from Bmld-
ing three took advantage of weather
conditions, crop reports, and the
price of hats, to organize a corner on
the local derby market. So effective—
ly was the corner consumated, that
for the first time in the nihty-slx
lyears of local trading, a Grinnell store
was relieved of its entire derby sup-
‘ply, and the first time since the panic
in 1875 that more than five people
walked into a store at one time.

It was a glorious day. Big derbics
on small heads, small del'bies on big
bends, sizes ranging from 61/9 to 9%
‘on hends ranging from 5% to lot/p
fits and misfits; all this featured the
annual celebration. ’ Those who had
[its were glad because they did fit,
others whose derbies did not fit were
happy because their lids only cost
one dollar.

Only one accident marred the dig-
nity and sancity of the day. A young
“sheik” from Building III was forced
to stand by and watch his derby
Spring EL leak and sink when struck
by a torpedo on the third floor of A.
R. H. By a series of telegrams and
long dismnce calls it is hoped to have
a fresh one here for him in time for
the spring opening.

The Freshman commission had en
tire charge of the unusually effective
Y. W, C. A. meeting which was held
in the Quadrangle drawing room last
Thursday Evening.

The service opened with a proces—
sional of all freshman girls, singing
"Comrades of Old Grinnell," followed
by the fine, but seldom sung, ”Hymn
to the Quadrangle." Winifred Read.
president of the commission, read
“Ring out, Wild Bells," from TennY-
5011’s "In Memoriam," and several
freshman girls gave short talks.

Margaret Butler traced the obser-
vances of New Year’ from savagely m
the modern customs of celebration.
lilaragaret Mighell, in a, talk on “lites-
olutions,” declared that although now
resolutions appeal to all types of
mind, because of their novelty, it taka
es genuine courage to carry them out.
Mary Tune, in discussing the new year
attitude, said that the Y. W. C. A.
triangle represents View points in
looking at the New Year: menml, phy-
sical, and spiritual.

Arlene strand, accompanied by Mar—
garet Smith, sang Ashfurd's “My
Task," and the service was closed with
the reading of one of Stevenson's
prayers and a violin postlude by Cleo
Kayser.

_______

Polling the unusually lal'ge‘votel of
over five hundred ballots in one
day, Grinnell college voiced its senti-
ment decisively in favor of the Bob
peace plan during the whirlwind one
day campaign on Thursday.
Out of a total of five hundred and
fourteen vote cast, four hundred and
fifty-eight were favorable to the plan
as against fiftyreight opposed to the .
proposal. The vote was much larger
than expected by campaign managers
and would seem to indicate that the
Bok plan has served as an unusual
stimulus in creating general interest
in international questions.
More Men Vote

Judged from a proportional stand
point, the men cast a larger vote than
the women, an apparent indication
that the vote was taken more serious-
ly in the dormitories than in the quad—
rangle. One of the most unusual
features of the vote was the comparat-
ively small vote of the faculty and
administration, only thirty-three votes
being cast. or approximately 25 per'
cent of the total of this group. This
compares rather strikingly with the
70 per cent vote of the students.
Considered from another angle the
figures gained from the balloting are
significant. The highest degree of
opposition to the plan came from
men who vote five to one in favor o:
the plan, as opposed to fourteen to
one by the women and thirty-two to
one by the faculty. The total vote
of the school indicated an eight to
one ratio in favor of the plan. This
is considerably lower than the figures
indicated by the Des Moines Register
vote which indicated a thirty to one
approving verdict.

Mangers Pleased
Due to the large vote cast, those
in charge of the campaign feel that
the results are rather definitely in-
dicative of the real sentiment of the
plan and point out that such a large
vote could not possibly be the opinion
of a. partisan portion but must neces-
sarily’ represent a cross section of
public opilion in Grinuell on the mile
under discussion.
Simulmneously with the college
campaign, a similar drive is being
held for the tow-n through the medium
of the town papers. So far results
from this soul-Ce are rather meager.
but general signs point toward an
increasing interest in the vote during
the coming week.

Religious Education
Lags, Says Speaker

“Religious and moral education in
college does not measure up to the
mental education,” said Rev. W. A.
Shullenbcrger, pastor of the Central
Christian Church cf Christ at Des
Moincs, in his address at Y. M. c. A.
last Thursday night. .

He went on to explain that college
after all is really a test of all life and
that one undergoes in college the
same things ﬂint he does in later life.
