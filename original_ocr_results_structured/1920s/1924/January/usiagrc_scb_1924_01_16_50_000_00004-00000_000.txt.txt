Indoor Track Men Are

Beginning Their Work‘

About eighteen varsity men and a
number of freshmen are now working
out for indoor track.

So far the work has been very light,
consisting o: jogging around the track
and calistbenics with gym classes.
strenuous training will not begin for
two or three weeks until all oi the
muscles are loosened up.

With one'or two exceptions, all of
the ysrsity men have reported and
with s fairly good representation from
the freshmen class, the squad is of a
workable size.

The United states, le» other a:
,tious, needs ior its own sa‘lvation, as
Well as for the common good, to get
lid of fixed ideas that fire at variance
with, and to cultivate EL national mind
iin harmony with, the facts of the mar]—
‘cru world. The first outstanding fact
lof model-n civilization is a system of
industry, transportation, exchange,
commerce, art, research, sanitation.
that operates without regard to politj
lcal barrier _ The second outstanding
fact is the increasing sway of the
democratic spirit throughout the
world. All the nations must, in timE,
learn the lesson of the world’s essen-
tial unity in this spirit and these pro—
cesses, and must find a way to express
lthis unity in active co-operation on the
basis of mutual understanding, res-
pect, and confidence. This is the fun-
damental condition of the order that
means peace.

Two things are therefore clearly in-
dicated as means of preserving the
peace of the world. The iirst is a
great effort of education and publicity
to bring home to the national mind
the facts oi'modern civilization. The
second is actual co-opsrstion in a par-
liament of the-world and in a world
court seeking peaceful solutiops of
the tensions that make for war. Such
participation, again, must inevitably
react as ‘a great educative lol'ce
among all the peoples who are con—
sciously cngdgcd in it.

The United states, traditionally
committed to a policy of isolation, has
peculiar need of nation-‘wide publicity
and education to develop a conscious-
ness of our relation to world problems.
The United states has for the same
reason peculiar need of active co—nper.
Minn with otheenations in the discus
sion and solution of world problems.
At the same time, there exists today
a world crisis which imporativcly de-
‘inands the energetic cooperation of
the United States, in order that the
civilization of Europe, to which me
one our own, my be saved from ir-
icparablc disaster.

Under these conditions, it is essen—
ﬁal that the United.Stdtes begin at
the earliest possible moment that at:—

l
l

 

ltivc cooperation with other nations

by, which alone Europe can be rehab-
ilitated. Of all methods 01' ceroperation
that have existed or that have been

: proposed, none save a permanent asso.

oiation of nations gives promise of
permanent results. Time being of the
essence oi the problem, the adhesion
of the United States to the covenant
of his League of Nations is clearly in—
dicated, unlcss there be a very high
probability that a better solution can
be found without delay. Such a better
solution has not yet been proposed.
Indeed, the summoning of a confer—
ence for the formulation of articles es—
tablishing a new association of un-
tions would involve perilous delay,

without any assurance. or even proba-

billty, oi. a more satisfactor issue.
Ill fact, representatives 01' other nil»
timls already in the League barb ax-
pl-csscd clearly their unwillingness to
abandon the League in ordcr to turn:
an alternative association. licanwbilc,

Covenant of the League would be per
culiarly lice irnm iislr for us, inas-
much as the oovouant sccurcs to us
the right of veto on all proposed action
and tho pii logo or entering the
League with reservations. Such resA
crvations arc desirable, perhaps near
cssury. in order that them may he no
ambiguity or iliisundcrstzlndlng about
our relation to the Loaguo and its ac-
tilities.

The adhc i of the United states
to the Cmenmlt oi the League of Na-
tions should therelore be made sub»
ject to the iollowrng brief statemmit
of policy and matters or fact:

1. The United States regards war
as an obsolete method of settling in-
ternational disputes in the world 01'
today and dcclarcs the neceSSIty or
providing eflcctil'e legal means for the
decision of all such disputes, of what-
ever nature.

2. The United states favors the im-
mcdiats creation by the League oi on
Economic Conference to deal authorr

war.
3. The United States fevers the Cree
atioii by the League of adequate agen~
effective publicity
throughout the member nations, and

cies to procure

adhesion oi' the United Stiltcs to the'

tntively with all the outstanding eco-'
nomic problems growing out or thcl

among educational loaders to givc the
youth of the schools rclmhlc iniornra—
tion about international rclations and
to inculcate through the schools ins
tcruational rcspcct, confidence, and
goodwill.

l. The United states, in adhering to
the covenant of tho Lnamo, expressly
disavows all rcsponsib ty for any
other portion or provision of thc‘
Treaty of Versaillcs, in which the, text
of tho Coronant is incorporated.

5. The United states declares that
adhesion to the Covenant oi the
Lcasuc'oi Nations in no wise impairs
the constitutional rights and privileg-
es of the Congress of tho Unitcd
states.

6. Thc Unitcd states explicitly dc-
clarcs that adhesion to the Covouant
oi the League oi Nations shall not inr'
volvc the use by the United States
either of military measures, or of the
boycott. on the recommendation of the
League, without the previous affirms»
lirc action of Congress. \

with such declarations and reserva—
tions, the relation of the United states
to the League of Nations would he‘
sufficiently clarified and guarded, and
the way would then be open for the
United States to that active and im—
mediate co—opcration with the other
luations of the world by which alone

lthe peace and safety of the nations‘
can be fully and permanently assured. ‘
