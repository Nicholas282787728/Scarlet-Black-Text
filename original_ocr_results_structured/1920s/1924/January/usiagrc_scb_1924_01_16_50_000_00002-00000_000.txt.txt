LNGONS CRITICISM.
No one can follow the utterances of
the Senate irreconcilable: and other

No.30.

Bok plan gives us the iii-st attempt
to poll public sentiment systematically
T on a concrete proposition arising lrom
lthe present world situation.

If the attempt tu clarify public Opiu-
ion on the league and court is worth
$100,000 to Mr. Bok, it shuluii be
worth your attention and considel’ac
tion.

Advocates of the parliamentary sys—
tem of government have always do»
clared that the direct vote oi the peo-
ple on important matters cl national
policy,'which it necessitates, is one or
its chief advantages over'oul' presr
dentinl system.

And there is certainly some truth
in that, viewpoint, for we possess no

regular method of plumbing the pub-
lic mind on great public issues.

The Bell referendum is unique in
our national history in that it gives
us a means to crystallize public opin-
ion about u definite proposal aimed ill.‘

the solution of a problem of paramount
importanckasll others pale before it

as all other considerations Will pale
before the prosecution or the war if
we are swept into another struggle.

elation, without becoming impressed!
with the stupendous inconsistency oi‘
their attack.

The World Court and the League oi
Nations are both criticized because
they “do not have any teeth.”
ihrce, public opinion, and economic,
rpressure, are ridiculed as
safeguards of peace. The court should‘
have teeth to enforce its decisions.

Moral

The league of nations is worthless her
cause it does not have sufficient force
behind it _

That argument works very well un-
til it become more convenient for
them to take an opposite Luck. Then
We hear this cry, "The court will im-

psir our sovereignt ,
will he a super-state."

Can not the sincerity cl their on-
position he impeached when they crit-
icize the toothlessuess of the court and
the powerlessness or the league in one
hreath,’ and with the next picture

America reduced to servility by these

twin monsters that would devour ODI'EWSS thoroughly convinced and sincere _

sovereignty and send our “boys to
right in the shambles or Europe?”

Does this inconsistency arise from
ignorance or insincerity?

'It seems to he a characteristic oi

question all sides of ziu issue before
taking a stand. That is portly the
reason tor this article.

We have heard of the League of
Nations and the “’orld court at every
tum. The daily papers are full of
such discussions, and it has been
talked of in near B\' ‘y conversa-
tion and argument, Grinnell college
has been indeed fortunate in that sev-
eral persons, of authority have been
secured to speak concerning both the
league and the court. However. they
have all been in favor of these organi-
rations.

Sarah Wanihaugh was the , zirst
speaker who told us at these great or—
ganizations irom the chapel platloim.
lShe was imbued with the spirit oi
these organizations, having herscil
served in the League oi Nations. She‘,

Next came John Cowles and Sidney
Istrong who had been in Europe study
.ing conditions, and were decidedly in
favor of these two great organizations
across the waters.

And lastly came Everett Colby, an
influential man in American politics
and head of the League of Nations‘
Nomrartisan association. He pres!
