With the DmkevAmes game today,
as the climax, the Missouri Valley
iootbcll season is rapidly drawing to
a close,

its the season now slahds there are
three teams that are still possible title
winners. Drake with no games lost
and only and tie looms up as a. strong
contender. while Missouri with four
viotories and one defeat and one game
yet to play,'snd Nebraska. with two
won and one lost, with one remaining
game today, also have strong possibil—
ities.

, Drake vs. Antes

The Whole championship race hinges
on the outcome of the Drake-Ame:
game, tor the Bulldogs have a chance
to either win, lose or tie for the hon-
ors. Should Drake defeat Allies, they
will save a clear claim to the title, but
if they lose, both Missouri and Nebras—
ks. have a chance, although the best
the Combuskcrs can do is to no for
the pennant,

.In order tor Missouri to win, Ame:
must beat Drake. and the Show—Mes
[must trounce Kansas Thanksgiving

game will be the deciding factor.
It Drlﬂw Loses

However if Drake loses, she will
have a percentage ot .750, and if Mls-
souri loses her percentage will be
.667, and here is where Nebraska's
chance comes in for if both these
schools lose and Nebraska beats the
Kansas Aggie: today, she will be tied
with Drake, each having a percentage
of .750r

Grinnell’s conference season has on-
ished, and with a percentage of .667,
the worst she can do is to tie for third
place, but if the race results in 5t tie
between Nebraska and Drake, the Pin-
neers will be tied with Missouri {or
