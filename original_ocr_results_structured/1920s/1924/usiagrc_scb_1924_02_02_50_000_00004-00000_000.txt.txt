Washington Cagers Trim Scarlet
and Black in Rough Game
on Piker Floor.

The Gripnell college eager-s lost to‘

Washington, 35 to 30, in a rough and
hard lought contest played at St.
Louis last Saturday night, Ian. 25.
The Scarlet and Black trailed through
out the genre but in the last iew min
rites of play they nncorked an oifen.
sive that threw a scare in the soutll~
el'us' camp.

Washington led at halt time, 20 to
12, but in a rally shortly before the,
final gun, the Pioneers displayed a
new brand of basltetball and drew
froln a trailing position oi 30 to 17 in
the score of 35 to so. In the second
half the Grinnell five scored 15 points
to the Filters 15.

Benz, Pioneer forward, was the high
point men, accounting for twelve othis
teams total, six of which he scored in
the last four minutes. Wogener, Pik—
er lorward, was next with ten tallies}
and was closely followed by his team
mates Minner and Seago with nine
each.

Gelvin and Winter worked well on
defense and in the first ball the St.
Louis team was tor-ced to resort to
many long shots. For Washington
the entire team played in the form
that is keeping her at the head of the
valley. I

The game was reported to be one
of the roughest contesLs ever seen in
the Washington gym and lolty fouls
were called by Referee Lamlte.

In order that posterity may be saved
on irreparable loss, all themes in Eng

tiled in a deliuiic manner. These vale
liable mos will be in Chicago Hall.

When the student graduates or

him on request. Tile teim theme.
~bich he so painstakingly tied with
ink baby ribbon will be handed to
him 153' tender fingers, and the themes
over which he wept will be'takeu trom
the archives in which they have been
preserved.

If he laclrs respect for antiquity
and does not care to‘ possess the re-
snlts oi his endeavor, the themes will
be turned over to Mr. Ennis as lood
tor the file, or published in the Ambit
ican magazine to increase the endow—
ment fund.

So it behooves ell seniors to watch
