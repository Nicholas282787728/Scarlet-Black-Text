Grinnell, fighting to the last man,
staged a thrilling comeback in the
lost half of the game Saturday, and
defeated Washington University 14-0.

The first quarter was played evenly,
neither team showing superiority, al—
though Grinnell advanced the hall to
the opponents thirty eight yard line,
only to lose it on downs. Indlscﬂm<
inate penalizing cost the Pioneers at
least one touchdown. The second
quarter was almost altogether a punt-
lng duel between ifeeter of Grinnell
and levy of Washington, With Levy
having a slight advantage in distance
over the Pioneer kicker. The Grinnell
line, strengthened by the addition of
Peterson and Rinefort, played stellar
ball and repeatedly threw the visitors
for losses as they tried to penetrate
the Pioneer forward wall. The kick-
ing of Levy gave the Pikers their only
chance to score as they advanced to
Griunell’s ten yard line but were held
for downs and Meeter punted out of
danger as the hall ended.

Grinnell came back strong in the
third quarter threatening to score in
the first few minutes when Levy’s
punt was blocked and the ball ad-
vanced to the threwyard line. Here
the Washington defense tightened and
the ball was lost on downs.

Captain Critchelt’s spectacular punt-

ing paved the way for the first touch.

down. In exchanging kicks with
Stockoff he twice punted out of
bounds on \Vashington‘s threeeyard
line. The second time Stalls returned
the bull to his twenty-eight yard line
and from hertz a series of end runs by
Moran, culminating in a. smash by
Sweet, put the ball over the gun! line.

Crltchett added the extra point by al

drop kick.

The second touchdown came in the'

ﬁnal minutes of play as a result of
W’ing’s brilliant fifty yard run, placing
the ball Within scoring distance.
