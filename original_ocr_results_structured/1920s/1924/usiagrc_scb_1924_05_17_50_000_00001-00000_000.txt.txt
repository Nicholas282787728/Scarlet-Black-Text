Wilson Describes Problems of
Neutral Legalion During
Hectic 1914 Summer.

“The Dutch government during the|
War AVAS hot lire-German as has been
sold, nor pronliies, but pro—Dutch
and pro-Dutch only," declared Pi'ol.
George Graitou \Vilsmi, Harvard E.‘
Chill ”9 lecturer talking at chapel
Thursday mar ass, on “A Neutral Lce
gallon in War Time.”

Mr. sou exhibited a. prolound
respect lor the courtesy and elflcieucy
oi th'c Dutch government in assisting
the American legation, of \Vhich_)l .

son was counselor during the he
tic days at the beginning of the il'orld
War. ‘

Mr. Wilson was sent as an dill to
Van Dyke, the famous poet, (‘5 st
and iccturcr, who had counted on a
leisurely sojourn in Holland during
his ministry. But at the beginning of
the War, Holland became the Mecca
for foreigners who had been in alien
countries and a place of utter distrac-
tion for the American legation.

In the [ire-war period, the minis-
ter's only assistant was at cumbersome
doorman. Shortly after the war was
Started the force increased to two
doorman. four blrrcjnolrcts from
Tennessee and twelve boy scouts to
keep the lines or applicants in their
proper order according to number, and
seventeen new members to the per~
manent farce inside the legatioii, with
as many volunteer workers as could
be obtained.

One of the principal early war [du-
ties of (h? legatilm was the location
of lost relslivcs who had not reached
their destinations on account of dis»
rupted transportation service Each
day the bulletin of the Amen an ic—
gation contained several "W‘ho's
Where" columns in an effort to discov-
cr where American travellers were.
A large room full of envelopes facili-
tated the search after one tiling sys—
em after another had been outgrown.

Routing travellers to lodging places
was another or the legatlon’s hcrcul—
eu‘n tasks. “imagine an area one
fourth the size of the state of lowa,
with three times as many people as
there are in Iowa on it, and you have
the situation of Holland in the early
days of the war."

The problem of getting home school
teachers who had purchased round
trip ticﬁts on the Hamburg—American
or North German Lloyd lines, who had
no money and no means of identify-
ing't'hemselves as American citizens,
was alsai perplexing. People with
inssnorts could borrow money through
a relief committee but few people
could prove their American citizen-
snip.

Mr. Wilson’s diary, parts of which
he read, revealed how quickly the war
was precipitated after the first run—
into between Austria and Serbia. no
pointed out that the fact that the va-
cations of the German and Austrian
ambassadors to this country were
cancclicd on July 22. 1914, proves that
those countries were contemplating
war at that early stage. '

NﬂlE [IN SUNDAY NNlES
BNNHIEI] BY NANNNNY

Quadrangle Declares Itself in Fa,-
vor of Legal Sunday Dates
In Spring.

The women of the Quadrangle held
a mass meeting Wednesday evening in
the Little Theatre at which time the
Sunday’date question and the new
Student Council constitution were
considered.

According to the newly drawn up
Constitution of the Student Council
which was passed on last week by the
student body, provision for the ap-
pointment of the chairman of com-
mittees-smong the women were lack-
ing in clarity. The constitution pro-
vided in Article 111 that “Four wom-
an elected by the Women’s league as
chairmen of corresponding Wlomeu's
league committees" be eligible to mains

Vote Power ’1'» Board

The procedure for election by the
Womens’ League was not stated. A
motion for amendment to the consti-
tution was carried unanimously, state
lug that the “minerals League board,
instead of the Wbmen's league, be gi -
en the power to appoint the four chair-
men of the corresponding Women's
league committees." The carrying of
this motion by unanimous consent.
makes it possible for the amendment
to pass without the vote at a. second
mass meeting. as provided by the con—
stituuon

The second matter presented to the
women, was that of Sunday dates.
Three alternatives were given on which
the girls were asked to vote: (1)
Whether they should do away with all
restrictions on dates, (2) whether they
should do away with restrictions on
Sunday dates and impose week—night
restrictions, or (3) whether the matter
should be left in its present status.

Sunday Dates Pnssed

The latter plan was voted on and
passed by an over~whclmingmsjor-
ity but at a later suggestion the ’votc
was taken that Sunday dates be legal
before Thanksgiving and after spring
vacation. The final suggestion how—
ever, that dates he allowed on Sun-
days only after spring vacation was
carried by a. large majority.

The amendment, which will not go
into effect until formally adopted, will
be formulated by the League hoard,
presented for approval by the faculty,
and brought before the women at a
second mass meeting, A two—thirds

views old, familiar scenes; and the

American artistsc boundless field for
their endeavor." Quoting Homer St.
Gaudeus, collecting famous works for
his exhibit at Carnegie Institute, Pitts-
