Belmont Theater Prize of sum two
years ago, as the most successful play
of the Harmrd 4’7 “'0 hop, ”You

now producing it on the road. George

the brilliancy of Wilde.”

Mr. George Baker, head of the 47

‘ other critic, writes Barry: “It is not
because thousands Df people have been

was not given due to a'lack of inter-
