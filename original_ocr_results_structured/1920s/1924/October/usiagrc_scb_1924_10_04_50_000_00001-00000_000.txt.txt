Upper Classes Are Large

The number of students in the three
upper classes is the largest by far that
Grinnell has ever had. Although clas—
sification figures are not available as
yet, it is probable that there is is bet-
ter proportion between the upper and
lower classes this year than ever be-
fore. In 1922 the freshman class was
more than four times as large as the
senior class; in 1923 the freshman
class was 2.9 times as large as the
senior class, and in 1924 it was two
and a half times as large. Most west-
ern colleges have freshmsn classes
three or four times as large as the
senior; Griunell is almost the only one
which shows a decided tendency to-
ward maintaining the proper propor-
tion between new and old students

This year's students show a wide
geographical distribution. Particular-
ly marked is the enrollment from
states east of the Mississippi. includ-
ing New England. Due to a variety of
causes there are no Chinese students
at Grinhcll this year; but there is one

of games won. .

Since Gl‘innell’s entrance in the Mis—
souri Valley, Washington university
of St. Louis has always been on the

the first three years, Won every game.
although in 1921, the Pioneers lost a
heart-breaker, 14 to 13. The next two
years, the Piker teams were consider-
ably weaker, and the Scarlet and
Binck warriors had no difficulty in
winning, and should Coach Hylftnd's
huskies cop again this year. the count
will be even.

Not much reliable dope is to be had
on the Piker aggregation so far this
year, but they are reputed to be con-
siderably stronger than they have been
for some time. They play their open-
ing contest against Drury College, to»
day, and this game will give some line
on Washington's strength. Drury. al-
though a small school, always puts
out good tellms, and should the Fillers
win by a respectable scam, it would
indicate that they again have a, for-

Wh at’s the Mailer
With the Band?

You notice there is no band at the'

game this afternoon. Why? Because
there were only fliteeo men out for
rehearsal last Thursday; mainly reeds
and carpets, according to James Fitz
director. ,

"We have plans and a constitution
for the band. but they cannot be adop-
cd until there is a basis for‘organizc-
tion. We must have more men," Ml:
Fitz stated.

The support oi the band in the re—
cent part has been poor, and in spite
of all the efforts of those in charge, it
apparcutiy coutim to be poor. Is—
lit the Grinnell spi t strong enough to
maintain a hand?
