Ames Captain Predicts
“Battle Royal” Today

In a letter received yesterday from
Captain Harry J. Schmidt of the
Ames team, he says, in regard to (on
days game, "I believe that it will. be
it battle royal from start to finish. W ,
at Ames, know of the aggressiveness
of all Grinnell tennis, and also or the
ability of Cuzteh Hylond to instill just
El. little additional ﬁghting spirit into
his men. Realizing this fact, we will
be “all set" to give at least: that much
fight, The team that Duts ul) the best
light will Win"

M erecliih Sweet

Sweet has been the most consistent
star of the Grinnell backfield for two
seasons. He is one of the men the Cy-
clones will have to stop if they ﬁgure
on winning today.

HUGE MASS MEETING

“We are not here tn discuss ally one
incident of tomol‘l‘uw but l'athel' The
‘etel‘nal' in Grllmell, the spirit which
can never die, which has been handed
down from one bunch of students to
years,” was
the keynote of the Homecoming pep
meeting struck by Stallt Turner cf the
class of ’11 last night.

Recalling the days of the Dammo
Club and the famous all day mass
meeting which solidified student spirit
behind the sclloolialthough it had
its more uncoxlilol‘tdble resultsi
Tul‘uel‘ spoke of the “never die” spirit
which has always characterized Grins
nail and which makes it impossible for
her to ever be really beaten whatever
'her score might Tie. He fired the
student body with detel‘minatiun to
go on the field behind the team with
an absolutely invincible light. "If
one of us falls in supporting the
team, it is just as bad as it the cap-
‘tain falls, from the standpoint of
Grinnell,” he said.

"We promise one thing; every man
that enters that game tomorrow Will
give every ounce in his physical make-
up to Win that game for Grinnell and
you." Ted Peterson gave this promo
ise to the student body and faculty
with an earnestness which could not
be mistaken. He was supported by
Hap Moran and Porter Martin,

Charles Holmes, of the class ot ’10,
president of the alumni, said that the
same old Grinnell spirit was manifest
which had enthusea the School thir-
teen years ago and that there was an
even greater determination among
the students and team to support the
school and pass the Grinnell name an
untarnished. .HC spoke of the loyalty
of the Grinnell alumni and reminded
the students that alumni all over the
United States were turning their eyes
towards Grinnell to see her once more
carry on the Grinnell tradition of fight
which cannot be overcome.

Rousing yclls showed the student
body to be bchlnd the team and school
with all their strength. The Grinch
"bullfighler" cheer leaders introduced
a new Pioneer yell which received
hearty approval. The hand assisted
with some PEDDY music and "Dave"
Peck led the crowd in songs.

“You and I,“ the first production of
the dramatic season In Crinncll, was
given lost night at the Colonial Thos—

under the direction of Mrs, Hallie
Flanagan.

The play is a brilliant piece 0K \vul‘k

smart and oven witty in its dialog; but‘

unsure. It presents the dilemma be»
tween art and business, found in a
mztu of is and repeated in his soili and
in both cases complicated by marriage.
Just what marriage has to do with the
dilemma besides making it more dis-
tressing, the play does not reveal, and
in belaboring the dilemma Barry
shows his youthfulness. Furthermore
he is dramatising the limitations of
the upper class without seeming to
be aware of the fact. The false val-
ues which arise in the play because of
this might be sufficiently established
with the aid of a professional cast, but
in the hands of amateurs they become

clones, in what promises to be the best
game seen on Ward Field this year.

With two weeks in which to pre-
pare for the Homecoming classic, the
protegcs of Hyland and Black are well
prepared to give Amos a histal'y»matk»
ing battle. Scrimmages against the
props, who used Amos formations the
last two weeks, have given the vars—
ity a good chance to familiarize them-
selves with the style of attack of the
Cyclones, and the development of a
defense particularly against the Ames
aerial attnck.

Injured lieu Bock

Several regulars have been on the
injured list, but with the possible ex-
ception of Winter, left end, will be
in condition to enter the game today.
Rjuetort was hurt in the Coo game,
and Moran was injured last week,
but it is confidently expected that they
will be able to start. Captain Crit-
chett, too, is in good shape, which
raises Pionecr stock considerably, be—
cause he ranks with the best hunters
in the valley, and the absence of his
too seriously handicapped Crinnell in
the Geo game.

The dope on paper is in favor of
Ames, as the agriculturalists come
here with one of the best teams in the
valley, having scored decisive victor-
ies over Kansa. Kansas Aggies, and
buying been defeated by Missouri 7
‘to u, in the last five minutes of play.
In addition, they played two Big Ten
conference schools, holding Minneso-
ta to a 7 to 7 tie last Week, and be-
ing defeated by Wisconsin, 17 to 0,
early in the season.

Oppose Strong Buchiicld

In the Behm brothers, Roberts and
Palm, the Cyclone have a quartet ct
backfield stars as good as any in the
conference, and they have a triple
,threat offense that has made , them
Feared all season. Johnny and Nort—
on Behm at quarterback and halfback
have consistently proven to be danger-
‘cnls in the running attack, and it was
N. Behm who starred in the Minnesota
game last week, by making an eight—
‘ty—five yard run for a touchdown in
;the first quarter. Roberts is pet-hops
the most accurate passer that Ames
has had ior ’some years, and further-
more, he is a punter and dl‘upkicker
par excellence, for it was his educated
too that beat Kansas. Nave and 009
‘are starring at the wings, and Coe is
also an excellent punter.

; The lineup of the Pioneers may have
‘several changes from that which start»

Vweeks, and competition has been ex-
ceptionally keen for several positions,
McClain is almost certain to start at
right end, and Scharnweber seems to
have the edge over the other candi—
:dates for the opposite wing, although
Taylor and Winter have been pushing
lbind hard for the berth. Duke will be
‘st right tackle, and either Rlnefcl-t,
Wood, or ilcwarth at left, with Cath-
cart and Martin, guards, and Pete?-
son center. In the backfield, stotts
will probably be at quarter, with
