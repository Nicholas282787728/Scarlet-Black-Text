Speaking before a fair sized audi-
ence in Herrick Chapel Saturday cvc-
ning, Dr. Edwin E. Slosson, noted
chemist, editor and author. talked on
the suhject "Creative Chemistry," ndr
apted from his popular work of the
same title. As Professor W. S. Henr
drixson said in introducing the snack
er. the lecture was announced to he
given upon the subject "The Full of
Energy and the Rise of Man," but
Dr. Slosson changed the topic of his
address because he felt that his chem-
istry lecture would be or greater in—
terest and vaulc than that on ener—
getics. At the close of his remarks
the speaker answered many questions
propouuded by interested persons in
the audience relative to the matter
just discussed.

In opening Dr. Slosson pointed out
that he was mining about an “open.
constructive" chemistry, rather than
about the “old destructive" science ol
the middle ages. “Now chemistry is
no longer a secret science; it is no
longer hidden under a veil of awe»
inspiring terminology. It is now by
tended to reveal rather than can»
ceztl." He spoke of stellar chemistry
which accounts for the composition or
light rays and heavenly bodies, and
of even the atoms composing them.
A dash of humor pervaded all
talk.

That “man may utilize his great
power over molecules and atoms to
the world's advantage" was the main
essence of the lecture. Illustrations
of the practical value of synthetir
chemistry were used to malre clear and
demonstrate the significance ol this
contention. Among other things shown

. by the speaker was a piece of Chem-
-ically manufactured fur, a part or the
only piece thus far made,

Can't Manufacture Fund

Dr. Slosson revealed the opporiunltr
ies in the world or chemistry tor the
development_ of many substances
which at the present time are derived
only from natural states of existence
in a wasteful and expensive way. "If
some chemist will discover and make
practical the artificial manufacture of
a substitute for leather," he said,"'I
would p'rcsent him with a prize of six
million dollars.” The scientist iwull»
ed upon the subject of the synthetic
menulacfure of foods also, but could
not see any possibility of ever hrlllgr
ing that particular thing down to a
practical basis. Hls lecture was con-
cluded with a Irank appeal to any in—
terested in the “creative science" to
“keep in mind the constructive powers
which will he in their grasp hy which
the world mav benefit if they will apr
ply themselves." ‘

Walter minutes Layton, lit Long
Chapel, Takes Optimistic view or
Britain’s Fmiu'c.

An optimistic View of the economic
future of Great Britain was presented
hy Waiter Thomas Layton, noted Engr
lisb economist, at long Chapel Tues-
day: ‘
“The high seas are to witness a
continual increase in world trade and
Great Britain/ls to have her share of
that trade, once her internal prob-
lems are settled," he predicted ’
"The lahor problem is the greatest
handicap to Britain's economic Well
being,” he declared. ”But labor is at
human problem and therefore remedi»

order the agreement in the coal in-;
dllsll'y in Great Britain whereby wages
are divided on a product sharing has-
is. Tire Workers receive the value
of $3 per cent. of the output as their
share of the profit. Since the instal-
lation of this plan, ]\Il‘. Laylon says,
there has been a steady increase in
production per 'md‘n per hour. "This
proves,” he concludes, "that the Wurli-
ers are learning that wages are de-’
pendent upon effort.”

 

Mr. Layton is not reconciled to the
views of pessimistic economists. They
fear that the runny countries who were I
compelled to do without the products

. of Europe during the war will contin-‘

tie to do so. The overpopulation of
Europe and the general disol'ganizzl-‘
tion, weariness and discontent seem
hopeless condltions to many.
Quows League

The speaker bases his optimisticl
view on the last trade report of the‘
League of Nations which indicatesl
that trade has returned to about the
same proportions as in 1914. He quote;
ed figures to show that England's Vol-
ume of trade during the slimmer of
the present yezlr reached that of tlle‘
Year 1913.

“Great Britain also possesses a per-
mzment asset on account of which she

COLONIAL THEATRE, November 14, 8:30 P. M.

“I suppose that YOU AND I would be described as a drawing—room comedy; well,
that’s all to the good. There are plenty of plays by Amercian dramatists dealing with
Small towns, the countryside, and with criminals; but after all these kind of plays do
not include the Whole of life; and to my mind it is fresh and pleasing to find a dramatist
who deals with educated and well—bred people. The foreigner is naturally thrown more
among these than among roughnecks and crooks. And I was happy to spend ‘an evening
in the agreeable company of fche people Whom I am accustomed to meet in America.”
