THE Sl'lll-I T YARTNI‘IRS.
As the season nears its climax and

pedestals it seems only fair to express

quote way, of the silent partners in
this business oi footballithe men who
have helped make the varsity what it
is today.

The best coaches in the country
can't make at winning team out oi the
world's eleven best iootboli players
without a little competition to put up
1ghlnst them on practice otternoons.

The stars of the gridiron are the
stars oi the campus during the root-
ball season. They're marked, heroic
personages wherever they go. Their
pictures are in the pepers; they’re
kept persistently in the limelight, and
the plaudits oi the collegiate populace
ring pleasantly in their cars, irom
