“DREAMS" A5 SUBJEBT

‘ Y. W Secretary Urges That All
Dreams Be Made on Incen-

“Do you merely dream of doing
something great after you are out of
college, or are you beginning to pre—
pare yourself for it now?" was the
Challenge of Miss Avilda Book of Iowa
City, who spoke on “Dreams” at the
r. w. C. A. meeting Thursday evening.

There are, according to Miss Book,
two kinds of dreams: those which
lead to nothing at all and merely
waste time, and those which lead to
something worth while. We should
set a sentinel to guard against the
former.

Using Annie Fellows Johnston's
story of "The Desert of Waiting”, Miss
Buck brought out the fact that we
should gain from every experience
that life offers, whether it he hitter or
sweet, and from these experiences dis-
til “the oil of sympathy for others .
“Is not any waiting worth while," she
quoted, “which will give you something
to gain Lhe royal entrance to the City
of Your Desire?"

"1 want you to think," concluded
Miss Buck, “that you are responsible
for your dreams and for dreaming

[ FllﬂM THE BRlllG’S BHAIR }

Framed in a charming setting. in the
glow of soft lights the Girls’ Glee
club gave a most gratifying concert
last evening in Herrick Chapel. a
crowded house greeted the popular-
organization and found the co-eds‘
more gracious and beautiful than every
l
it is hard to judge a program of}
music when there is so much to oc-‘
copy the eye, nevertheless we found
the first part of the program of muchI
interest. There was a great coal oil
var ty, and performances which var-
icd'iu individual excellence. The
Greek Pastoral scenes of Horn
Parker were uniformly good, but
lacked the perfection of the following
numbers, Considering the difficulty
of the composition the performance
was most creditable.

Ferrari’s “Moon Madness’ gave the
Glee club its greatest opportunity, The
club sang it with unusual enthusiasm,
splendid ensemble, and regard for
tonal effects.

Solos Are Good

Miss Bickel was much applause with
two solos, exhibiting a voice of much
flexibility and clear, bellrlike tone.
Miss Martin played 'cello solos that
were a delightful contribution to the
evening‘s program. Miss Cartauo in—
terpreted Lisztls “Love Dream No. 3"
in s'msnncr entirely her own; one
which we liked vel'y much.

A double quartet song “The birth
or die Opal” by Reed. and responded
to an encore with "Drink to Me Only
with Thine Eyes." The second selec—
tion was song very well, the voices
being delicately blended and subc
dued.

“Silver Bells and Cookie Shells," the
Blllm—Kel'r opus was an artistic and
musical success. The lyrics of the
little fantasy were s rightly, the mus-
ic tuneful. The singing of the club
was spontaneous. such singing brought
out the rhythm and melody of each
number.

The organization was fortunate in
securing as soloists, Misses Parzyhok,
Smith, Hawkes, Hurlbut and Heldrldge.

the song. has never been in better

"silver Bells and Cockle shells"
should hc considered a little triumph
by its author and composer. They
should realize, too, that their work
was given a tinwlcss performance by
the Girls Glee club, a performance
that will lie rememhcrcd.

Preceding Miss Buck's talk, Helen

itupc of the Acme Chatauqua company
‘of Des Moines in Y. M. C. A. meeting
:Thursday night. Mr. Rupe opened
his talk by citing examples of men,
who had natural talent and were well
cqlllpjl d for a real work, but wasted
lnll tlr r time flitting from one profesc
slim to another. The speaker continu-
ied by saying that it is not so import.
ltanf. to make a careful choice. but
'the importance is how to proceed aud
how to succeed after the choice is
made.

“Come back boring in for more,”

Rinefort should make a splendid
track men that Griuneli has had for
some time. In his favorite event, the
discus throw, he broke four meet rec—
ords last year. The state meet record
and the Crinnell invitation meet rec»
ord were among those to fall. Ee-
sides the discus the prep captain is

several other men have good high
school records and are expected to
show promise here. Clarke Newlon
of Winterset won the quarter-mile at
the local inter-scholastic last year in
fast time. Niblo, also of Winterset,
is a jumper and high hurdler. Bocttger
of Grinnellr and Meeter of Hawnrden
are both shot putters who were far
above the average in high school conr
petition. Von Shrocder of ottumwa
is a good high jumper who clears the
her not far below six feet. Gould of
Colfax is a distance man of no little
ability, other men who did good
work in prep schools are A. Johnson,
East Des Molnes, pols vaulter; Hays,
Sioux City, sprintcr; Patten, Mason
City, hurdler. Several more who did
felr work in high school show possi-
bilities of development.

Frosh forwards did consistently good

the sophomore forwards showed a bet-

After a comparatively slow start,
the freshmen hit their pace and put
through two fine baskets. Sophomore
forwards then located the hoop for
two ringers, but wen: handicapped by
lack of teamwork. Another freshman
basket ended the quarter with a score
of 6—4. ‘

Freshman forwards hogan brilliant
criss-cross passing in the second quar-
ter, hut were held to one basket, while
the sophomorel mind me.

The third quarter was furiously
fought in every section of the field.
Both Lauder and Hal s, freshman

DRAKE RELAYS TO BE
BIG EVENT OF YEAR

Huff May Enter Three Teams At
Drake Carnival Besides ‘
Taylor In Hurdles.

With the advent of warm weather.
Pioneer track aspirants arc polishing
up their spikes and appearing for out-
door work. From all advance dope,
"Due" Huff will have as strong a team
as ever when the scasoh rolls around.

Home Meet Opens Season.

The season will be formally opeucd
with the annual home meet, April 12.
Tho junior class, home inset champ—
ions for two years, are doped to re-
pcate this year, but tho freshmen, al-
ways an uncertain quantity, have a
galaxy of former high school stars,
and will furnish strong opposition.
This meet will also serve to give coach
Huff a line on his varsity material for
possible entries in the Kansas relays
and the Drake relays, the two weeks
following.

In flll probability, Grinuell will be
represented at the Drake carnival by
both a mile and a half-mile team, and
possibly, if the material comes up to
expectations, at two mile relay team
will also be entered. In addition it
is expected that Taylor will run in
the special 120vyard high hurdles.

Thc state meet this year will he held
at Ames. and "DOC” Huff will, as
usual, cnter a full team the: . In
addition, there will be two duals, one
with Oklahoma and one with Drake,
and the season will end with the Mis-
souri Valley meet at Lincoln, May 24.
There will be no National Collegiate
this year on account of the Olympic
tryouts

Mabel-Kill is I'lellﬁﬁll

It is yet too early to predict the
personnel of the team, but it is certain
that Taylor can be counted on to win
points in both hurdles in practically
any meet, and “Jack" Boge is expect-
ed to come through in the discus and
shot put this year. Captain Me-
Ilrsth and Meyer proved that . they
worc in good shape by placing in the
hnlfmlile, and two mile respectively,
at the Kansas indoor meet, and they
