A SUGGESTION

Theoretically, a body elected perm-I
enently for the purpose of making laws
is the only complete solution Such
a drastic step would mean the reor-
ganization of the Whole system of wo-
step which

experiment has been tried out on a

Until B. complete solution can be

worked out, why not provide on elm
ergoncy measure which will givc the
Quadrangle at large a. chance to vute
on its own laws? when a. question
or old rules comes up, why not pro-
vide for additional and more direct
representation?

Let two girls he elected by each of
the six cottages; and let that tempor-
ary committee of twelve, meeting with
the

and

the League board and balancing

Since the whole question arises from '
the fact that we have outgrown a form

A fine compliment to the Grinncll
