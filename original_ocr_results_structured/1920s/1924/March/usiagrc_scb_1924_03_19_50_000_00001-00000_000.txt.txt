Di. David Frldzty, representative of
the National Transportation Assocla-

country, will speak in Grinnell Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday of next Week.
One of these lectures will he delivered

Dr. Friday comes here in the inter-

many colleges and universities in the
United States. According to announce-
ment made several weeks ago by the,
economic and spccch departments, such
a. contest was scheduled to bc hold in
Grinnell, but plans are yet tentative.

1926 Cyclone Board
Elections Postponed

The election of a Cyclone board by
the Sophomore class, which was to
have taken place this week, has been
postponed pcnding action contemplatv
ed by the Student council. The elcc-
tion of annual board assismnts from
the freshman class has also been post-
ported.

in an effort to takc some step that
will materially improve the present
annual board organizatioon, a com—
mittee of the Council is now consider-
ing the matter and will present its
report at a meeting of the Council at
9 p. in. Thursday. The committee is
composed of Louise Moyle, chairman,
Hilda Mauck, Mark Entorf, and Forrest
Chapman.

ALUMNI ASSDDIATIDNS
PLAN DLASS HEDNIDNS

Classes Which Were in College at
the Same Time to Hold
Reunions Together.

 

Gl'innell Alumni associations in
a number of cities are seriously con-

class rcunions, and somc definite ac»
tlou will probably be taken at the
coming commencement rcunion.

Under thc present plan each class‘
comes back every five years. This
means that when a class has a re-
union non of the other classes which
were in school during the same per-
,iod are present. No class holding a
reunion isncquulntcd with any other
class doing the some thing.

The plan undcr consideration is
known as the Dix plan. Under this
plan classes come back in groups all
intervals of five or sis years. Classes
which were in college at the Same
time have their reunions together. In
this way an alumnus coming back for
a class reunion, sc‘es more of his old
friends, not only in his own class, but,
from the other classes which were ln
school during his college career, This
plan has met with approval from the
associations at Minneapolis, Boston,
and lVaslllngton, and in no association
hustlt met with disapproval.

Another matter which will be dis-
cussed at the coming commoncemen‘tl
is that 0! moving commencement
ahead one day, thcrchy graduating the
class on Monday instead of Tuesday,
This would bring alumni day on Sat
ul‘dny instead of Monday, which is de
sired by a great many old grads. Sen—
Ior day would be Friday instead of
Saturday.

Definite action will bc taken at com—
;msuccmcnt time this year and if these
proposals are passed they will prob—
ably“ take effect in 1925.

The Trchity Grinnell Alumni asso-
ciution of the alumni associations of

will hold their annual meeting March
27. Prof. H. W. Matlack, director of
the Publicity bureau, will represent
Grilluell college at this meeting,

Debate Here Tomorrow Night Is
Part of Dual With Ames on
World Court.

/

Daily practices are marking the
preparation of Gl'innell's debaters for
the final till, of the Season, which
will be held with Ames tomorrow and
Monday nights.

At 7:30 tomorrow evening in the it
R. H. auditorium Othel. Wearin, John
Stchn, and Harry Raynolds will negate
the arguments at an lowa State of-
firmative on the World court question.
Unlike the other debates of this been
son, tomorrow night's question does
not involve the Harding reservations.

A return debate, in which a, local
affirmative team, James Work. Herold
Hicks, and John McGeé, will meet an
Ames negative tI‘io at Andes, will be
held next Monday night.

Each of these contests will be of the
audience decision type, which Wail
tried out so successfully in the recent,
debate with Belolt. In this Way it is}
felt that a fairer appraisal of thc e£<|
ientiveness of the arguments can Del
made, and some idcfi as to public opinr
ion on the mutter may be obtained.

Following the formal debate and de-
cision of the audience, an open forum
will lie held, in which the uudience
my question either tcam on any
phase of the “’uI‘ld court question. In
‘tlle light of the enthusiastic open
forums which have followed each
debate this year, a spiritcd and clar-

ing discussion is assured.

ENTEHTAINED PLEASES
ADDLENDE WILD SDNDS

“Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” and
other Negro Spirituals
Prove Delightful.

Everyone who dttcndcd Lucius
E‘inch's program at Herrick chapel
Monday was l-ewardcd with an ovo-
ning of delightful as well as instruct-
ive entertainment. Reading and
singing to an interested audience, Miss
Finch entirely justified the splendid
rcconnnendations with which her eh-
sagcment was heralded here.

Her famous interpretation of ne-
gro Mammy stories in the character-
stlc expression and dialect of the
southern sluve days delighsd her lists
encrs, The quaint negro songs or

 

ed her evening's entertainment, werc
at once jubilant and melancholy, a
true echo of the negro's lifc,of bond»
ago in the days preceding the Ci '
war. Many of these songs, with
which few people are at all acquaint
ed, have never been published. PEI-
haps the audience enjoyed must of all
the Virginia version of that old negro
classic, “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"
Miss Finch accompanied thc songs
with an explanation of how each negro
locality had its particular version of
the common negro songs and its par~
icular folk lore and dialects.

She made he interpretations the
more realistic by telling little per-
sonal incidents and by describing thc
old ncgro Mammy of her childhood
days. Only an artist who has studied
the negro folk and has intimately
known thc actual life and thinking at
tho negro peoples, and who is also an
accomplished olocutiouist, could put
into a program the wealth of feeling
and expression which was so outstanda
ing in Miss Finch's interpretations.
The audience was alfcrnatcly impress-
cd and amused by Mdmmy's versions
or Moses in the bullrushos and the
story of the creation.

Grinnell Is Only Co-ed College To
Be Studied During Six
Months’ Survey.

Although it is distinctly contrary to
their policy to discuss their “ﬁndings"
in the various schools they Visit, the
research Workers who have Spent the
last few days in Grinnell were frank
in admitting that they were quite [ELV-
orahly impressed with the atmosphcle
or the college as a whole. The weak
nosscs which they have inevitably
found they declare to be of minor im
Dol'tance.

Pl'ol. C. E. Rugh, of the Univeislty‘
of Cullfmuia, 531d: "Grinnel‘l has
splendid body of students, (I. ﬁne {al-
low ship between students and faculty
Your students heIa seen] to me as
loyal as a student body could be."
Miss liutton is quoted as saying that
she had never met with more intelllr
gent and willing cooperation than
she had found nmohg both the Students
and the faculty at Grinhell.

FO)‘ reasons which these represent».-
tives oi the Institute of Social and Re-
ligious Research are unwilling to give
dcnnltoly for publication, it happens
that Gi'innell is the only coeducational
college to be studied during the six
months' survey which they are making
of American colleges and universities.

n

The results of the survey will be pub».

lished next September, and the facts
which the group who visited Grinucll
found of interest about the college will
be mentioned at M Una.

When asked what he had discovered
as to drinking among college men, in
the various institutions he had visited.
Mr. Rugh Teclared that there seems to
be much less drinking this year than
last. At one university visited, t
students claimed that this year was
the dryest since pl'ohibltiun has beél'h
in eﬁecL

“One southern university," said Mr.
Rugh, "where a gentleman is uccus-
tomcd to drink as a southern gentle-
mzlu does, there is a strange Custom
which concl-ns the 'p‘lcdgc druico', Out
of deference to the no-cds no mun will
drink on the afternoon preceding a

sults in dismissal from the univei»

When questioned regarding collego'

The Gl-illnell College Dramatic club
introduced a large house to an entire—
ly new departure in local amateur
dramatics when it presented 0 corn
“Beyond the Horizon" at the Colonial
~last Saturday night, March 15. There
are few plays that could present
more baffling dlfllculties to the now
professional company. It calls for
two and unashall hours of emotional
tension for both actors and audicncc,
and its potcntialities for disaster in
presentation are without numbcr.

Presenting a homely slice of life,
sordid, but not over-drawn, it offers lit—
tle comfort to the Pollyanna, every»
thing is sunshine and rosebuds, happy

to prcscnt the clash at elemental,

A capable cast, a sympathetic di—

ager combined to make "Boyond the
.Horizon“ an artistic success. it ap-
,Drozlcned as close, if not closer to
|drama, whatever that may hp, than
anything we have witnessed on the
Grinnell student stage.

Wilma Thompson, Richard Steiner,
and Basil Talhott bore the burden of
the tragic situations, yet with all their
ability the play would have been un-
iconvlucing had it not been that the
,suppcrting cast rendered genuine sup-

iport.

Miss Thompson found the play an
excellent vehicle for her talents. Her
transition from the simple, attractive,
but depthless country girl to the
broken, beaten woman, with an onlire
change in the timbre oi hsr v
was one of the most remarkable sic—
mcnts or the presentation. At one
curtain her audience paid an uncon-
scious tribute to her convincing por-
trayal by holding itsclt breathless
while she slowly made a complcto
cross and exit without uttering a
word.

We can not imagine many harder
rules than that which Mr. Steiner Cain
ried. The dreamer, doomed to bol—
low dreams, tricked by the Fates, suf-
focated by an inhospitabler envll'oh— _
ment. Although we wished for more
naturalncss at times, especially tow-
ards the ﬁrst or the play. he realized
to an unusual extent the possihllttics
of the difficult characterization.

Mr. Talhott was the dark horsc of
the trugedians. He was handicapped
by his merited reputation as’sure fire
stuff when cast in comedy. But the
manner in which he stepped into the
boots of the unselfish, uncultulsd farm
lad gave real proof of his ability to
act, He accomplished his transitions
with ease. To him bclong the ldul'els
for naturnlness and sincerity.

The Climax carried tn the tirst act

hit by the supporting cast. Gladys
