The three longest established or the
perennial revues are The Mei-ens ,
Show, Ziegfeld's "Follies", and Ncwi
Work winter Garden "Passing Show."
A. 3. Marcus, Ziegfeld and the Shu-
berts are among the three wealthiest
showman in America. Many have
'attempted to follow their tootsteps.
Some have prospered for a brief span
of life.

Ziegfeld conﬁnes his activities for
the most part to the pert of the comb
try east of Chicago while on the other
hand, A. B. Marcus is the only owner;
of a big annual extravaganza who is-
vors the middle—west, west and south.

.attraotlon. He believes in dividing
territory with no one. Therefore, the
manual ndvent of the Marcus snow is
regarded as a red letter event in the

Even in the style of the entertains

the Marcus show, which comes to
