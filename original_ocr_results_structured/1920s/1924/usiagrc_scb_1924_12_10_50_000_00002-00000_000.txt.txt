USE DISCRETION ‘

With the coming or the winter seas»
on, the annual dormitory house parties
with all their attendant expanse and
costliness, will begin to appear.

In former years it has been the prac-
tice for the ﬁrst building gdving a
party to make it as "doggy" as posse
ole, whereupon as each succeeding
hall planned its party, more expense
and frills were added in a determined
effort to outdo the preceeding social
affairs, and such a custom has ob-
viously had its bad effects.

In the iii-st place, one or two of the
buildings have had to abandon entire-
ly the idea or giving a party, because
too few of the members could afford
it, and then in the buildings that (lid
decide to hold, open house, there were
many who had to spend that evening
some place else, for it was a ﬁnancial
impossibility for them to attend. still
others, in order to be good sports, and
to stand by the vote of the majority,
attended and paid for their share of
the party when it was truly beyond
their means.

We do not believe that honso parties
should be abandoned, quite the con-
trary in fact. They add to the social
lite of the school, give the “co-eds" a
chance to see the dorms when
they are "dressed up”, and give good

social training, which is as‘much a
part of our education here as any»‘

thing else}

CONGRATULATIONS

Now that the 1924 football seasonI

is a thing of the past, sport waiters,
and sport followers are wont to gath-
er around the fire and discuss the
great games and great players of the
past season, and incidentally, to pick
an all—star team of some sort.

Of these “stovedeague” teams, much
can he said on either side. They are

generally unsatisfactory, for it is in—

conceivable that one man could pos-

sibly pick the eleven best players, or
even the twenty»two best players, out
of the hundred or two he has seen in
action during the season.

Nevertheless, no matter whom the
particular sport writer happens. to
favor, there are always a few stars
who have shone so consistently on the
gridiron that all scribes mention them.
And because of this fact, membership
on these teams is considered an honor
to be highly prized.

It’is an honor not only to the player
himself, but also to his coach who de-
reloped him, and to his school, for
seldom it is that a man who played
on a poor tcfmzl, is given first team
But ten-eater is the honor-

when a star is not only mentioned by

mention.

one scribe, but several.

in view of the success at the?ioneer
gridders this fall, it was only natural
that se‘tel‘al Gl'irlnell stars should be
mentioned in’the All-Missouri valley
teams, and eight of the team were giv-
en this honor. As is shown else»
where in this paper, a composite team
taken from the selections of min- of
the best known sport writer or this

section of the country, gives one Pia-l

neer, Lester Duke, 3, position on the
first All-Valley team.
Only twice 'before, since Grinnell

>was admitted to the Missouri Valley

conference, has a Pio‘heer star gained
this recognition. in 1922, Norelius
was the all-conference center, and the
Datesman was an all-
eonference end. This year, Duke, ale
