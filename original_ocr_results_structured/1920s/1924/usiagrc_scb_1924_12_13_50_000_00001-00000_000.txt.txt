The second round of the class series

the Men's gymnasium, Thursday after-
noon, the juniors winning from the

Lester Duke started the scoring for
the seniors with two baskets before
the game had fairly begun. After this
however, the '25 learn got into form
and they counted two baskets and a
Tree throw, :while holding the senior:

in the second half with Sweet and
Moran working the offense the jun-
-io'rs started a. scoring machine which
seemed to baffle the last year men and
the game ended with the juniors at
1he big end of a 13 to 7 score. Taylor
and Duke played good ball for the sen-
iors. Coach Winter shifted his men
vainly trying to find a combination
that would effectively stop the juniors,
but was unable to do so.

With the pre-season game with Wis-
consin only a Week eff, Coach Black is
putting his cagers through a stiff
course in a new style of play in pre-
paration for the Badgers, His main
handicap is the entire shift of systems
and the necessity of building this
different form of offense and defense
in two weeks.

The squad has been working main.
ly on the defense and the fundamen-
tals and only the last few nights havé
they received any offensive training. A
short scrimmage follows the practice
each night and the men are working
hard for their positions.

Captain Gelvin and Winter seem to
have the advantage for the guard p054
itions although Wing is a Valuable man
and will hfwe to be reckoned With.
Hays and J. Stotts are pushing these
men hard for berths and Rage and
Seelanu are battling for the center
position. Although no varsity men

' are back to fill the. forward pos ions,

that lack will be filled by . lorau, Lamb.
and Larson, who are fighting for posi-
tions against Chase, Doffiug and VVil~
son.

No positions seem to he named and
waiting for the man to come and fill
them. There Seems to be an equal
chance for any man on the squad to
make a berth at least part of the
time,

GRINNELL, IOWA, SAH'URDAY, DEUEBUXER 13, 1924.

Crinnell To Get
1 Next State Meet

Crinuell will get the 1925 state
track and field meet. it was decided
at the annual meeting of the fowa cil-
lege conference schedule meeting held
in Des Molnes this week, it was vot-
ed to give the meet to Crinnell despite
the fact that Iowa university was cp-
posed to holding it this year.

Following the plan adopted two
years ago, state meet is given to
one of the "Big Four," lowa, Amos,
Drake, and Griunell, in rotation. Form-
erly it was usually held at Des oMiues
but starting in 1923, lowa City had
it, and the next year it was held at
Arms. This is_the first time in a
good many years that Grinnfell has
held a state track meet here.

The definite date was not set for the
meet, but it will probably is hold on
May 23. It is expected that practic-
ally all the larger schools in the state
will have full teams entered in the
meet.

The first of a series of mixed din-
ners held in the Quadrangle and nor»
iuitory dining halls last night was a
distinct success. Occupants of both
places of residence turned out prac-
tically en masse to attend this Dre~
holiday dinner.

A feature of the mix was that no
dates were required.
Both dining balls were arranged in
concordance with the approaching
Yuletide season. A cheery, old snow
bedecked Santa welcomed guests at
the entrance of the Quad dining hall.
Red cardboard, shaped as sleds, were
used as place cards.

A short impromptu after dinner
dance was held afterward at both the
“rec room” at the Quad and the dining

com in the Dorms,

The success of this first mixed din—
ner may be attributed to the efforts
of a committee headed by Katherine
Davis, and Walter Ingram, and issis»

Unusual Program of
Talks at Y. Meeting

Two of Gi-innell's most popular pro—
fessors appeared on the v, M. C. A.
program last Thursday night. Faguy»
Cote favored the audience with s so.
lection, “Holy Night," by Adam, and
Professor Steiner spoke on the sub
ject, “We Don't Know Where We're
Going But We've Got to Start From
Here,"

Dr. Steiner began his talk with an
excellent tribute in Mr. Faguy-Cote,
His opinion was shared by many of
those present, who afterwards spoke
of the inspirational value of the evo-
nillg's music.

The fundamental laws of the unis
verse can not be changed, Dr. Steiner
believes, Therefore, we must recognize
them and guide our lives accordingly.
The power of man ls great, but he
can not stop either old age or death.
These things are inevitable. ,

Our part in the scheme of things is
not to gain power and richcs, but ralli-
er to give service and help the other
fellow. In this way, thc soul. which
alone will be of value on the final day
of reckoning. will be dcvcloped to the
highest possible degree.

A new divinity building for the
use of the theological department at
Chicago Unive ity is to be erected
immediately. A gift of nsoomu was
made for this purpose and the sum has
since been supplemented until it
amounts to a little more than $400,-
000. Tim divinity school which now
enrolls about 500 students annually
has never had a building of its own
but has used recitation halls in the
other buildings of tho campus. The,
now provision is expected to give, the
work a great impetus on the univer-

 

sity campus.

Xmas Malteaser To

irtl Issue of “Campus Cltt” to Con-

The Christmas number of the Mal-
tcaser is on the presses and will be in
the bands of its readers next Thursday

to one of the Managing Teasers, is a
very clever outlay in black and white
and is a result of the combined efforts
of pauline Crook and Russ stone.

Followers of the old Cat will have a
chance to see some of the best art
work of contemporary publications
when they open the pages of the
Christmas book. Some of these ar ,
,Notre Dame Juggler, Wisconsin Octo~
pus, New York Medley, Washington
Columns.

The editors of the Maltsaser, when
inmrvicwed‘today, stated that the next
issue of the hook is to be Malteaser
Scandals number, to appear some time
in February. Contributions, both art
zind literary, asserted the editors,
should be suggestive of the "Scandals"
themusical comedy presented annuals
ly by students of Gi'innell college.

”PAHAﬂﬂXEE” SUBJEIJT
ﬂF BIHKHUFF LEﬂlUﬁE

Harvard Exclmllge Professor Talks on
“Relutivistic Waxes" at
Chapel I-‘n'dhy Morning.

Professor Birkoff, Harvard ex-
change nrofessor, discussed “Relativ:
istic Paradoxes" at long chapel Fri.
day morning. Mingling a touch of
humor to the seriousness of his dif-
ficuit subject, Professor Birkhoff was
very effective in explaining his theme-
in an interesting manner.

In the first place, he declared, the
supreme paradox of relativity to most
people is the idea. of simultaneity.
First suggested by the early Egyptians,
it was regarded as rather silly but
as people realized that the earth was
not flat, so in relativity they grasped
the realization that slmultaneit'y was
perfectly possible physically. “

The whole difficulty with paradoxes,
he added, is that people.mix up var-
ious theories. They take one. sys-
tem of space and time measurement
and mix it with another. Consequent-
ly, the result is obscure because
space distance and time distance are
often tangled up in their use.

The first paradox to he discussed
was the absolute paradox, wherein we
strive for absolute space and time that
is simple and useful. Next, the
clock paradox illustrates the theoret-
ical analysis in which relativism tell
us that if we take two clocks. both
at rest in empty space, and move one
away and then back, thatvless time
will have elapsed for the one than if
it had remained at rest. To the or-
tliuary nearer this sounds very com-
plex but outwardly amusing. In turn,
he discussed the "age of light" and
the "weight in motion” paradoxes,
likewise in themselves, perplexing
and inazy as the previous Cami-Hoar
tions.

We must be extremely modest in
our views, he explained regarding
things physical, although humanity
is getting to the point where it can
create very interesting possibilities.
The greatest idea to grasp is that

itliere are no paradox»: if We are Will—

ing to acceuL one theory of space and
time, and do not try to take several
and make the effort to correlate them,
but rather accept our particular point
of view for technical reasons.
