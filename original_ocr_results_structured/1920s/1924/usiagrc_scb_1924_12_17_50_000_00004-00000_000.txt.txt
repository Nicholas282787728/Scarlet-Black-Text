OFFICIAL NO'I'I
l Several weeks ago I hung my cane
on the haliistradc at. the root or the

stairs in Alumni Recitation Hall. and

whcn I rcturiied after my recitation it
was gone. It had been my practice
to hang it there to avoid the inconven—
iellcc or cirryiiig it with my hooks up
the stair I am surc the person who
removed it did not realize that the
cane belonged to me, or that 1 would
have considerable trouble in replacing
it with another one exactly suited to
my need. This wcel: another oaue
with which I have been trying to get
:tlong was taken li-om the same place.
If they could both be returned to me.
or lott some place where I would be

sure to get them heiore the holidays.‘

I would appreciate it very much.
