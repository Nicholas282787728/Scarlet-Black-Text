"woonnow WILSON ls DEAD."

For him the headlines of ten mouse
and papers have been set in boldest
type. Tomorrow, those selfesztme let-
ters that spell his death will tell the
latest sensation of an oil scandal.

Such is Lne nature of the pressito
pass lightly from the tragic to the re-

diculous, from the heights to the depths
of life’s shifting story, and to pause

but an instant wherever it goes.

WOODROW WESON

When all the world was reeling and the dark
was gathered thick and deep around men's minds
And dreadful fear was clutching at their hearts,
No voice was rltiserl that could the meaning tell
or all the woe and pain, the clash of arms.

UnLil he spoke, the prophet, now at rest.

A liul'stillg light irom Heaven were not more clear,
No surer trumpet note was ever heard“

Then his high words. Lihc living flitmc they pierced
The fearlnl night, and men who blindly groped

And cried for light took heart; tor then they saw
What he had seen, this leader, now at rest.

In anguished siege before the mystic Veil,

Or in some grand apocalyptic hour

He read the very heart of God, and learned
His purposes for a benighted world,

N0 less than this Wits in the Words he spoke,
This soci- inspired, this ohieftain, now at rest.

We knew it when We heard him, were we those
Who spent long years within erupting Hell,

0r hora at home the stl'itin of daily tasks.

We knew that from the holocaust and blood

A golden age might come. He showed us how,

This God-touched man. this hero, now at rest.
But, even as the world’s great suffering heart
Leuped to embrace the thing that he had shown,
They struck him down and strangled him with hate
Who loved their little interests more than God,
