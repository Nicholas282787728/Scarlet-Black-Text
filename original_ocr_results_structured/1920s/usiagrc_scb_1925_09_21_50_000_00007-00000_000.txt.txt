Of course, all mining is not done on the surface. But
there are many mines in which electricity has changed

our conception of mining operations.

Wires, pene-

trating even to the deepest shafts and galleries, have
brought light, power’, ventilation and added safety to
those who must work in the very bowels of the earth.

Electricity’s contribution to mining may be of partic-
ular interest to the student of mining engineering, but
it is of general interest to all college men as still another
example of how electricity is simplifying the world’s

work.
