f‘We Cannot Ignore The Laws
Of Nature” Says President Main

In Address To

President ii in opened his lidccdl~
uni-care addre Sunday morning by
telling ot the invention oi the (\QYOA
plane as illustrative of it pr v essivc
adienturo iii the capture oi truth \ot‘
ln-actital uses.

He said, ' ‘lle little llight oi the

Haulr [\lOlltl'rone years ago was the

child or celiturics ot iriiih mid cone

vietion that ihglit by intn could and
would he hicvcd. That is the great
fat-t of growth in the spirit or man.

_ The Wrights and other pioneers who
worked in thc curly days or aviation
were but finitl agents in bringing to
realization the truth that in the be»
ginning looked ioi- unioldiiient. That
truth was implicit in the cosmic dust
from which this earth or ours has fine
ally come into its glory of beauty
and order,

”One fancies he can see the slender
precession of those who prophesied
flight as it holds its way through the
centuries. It is a slender broken
line of dreamers. 0n the side were
the hosts of those who did not dreamr
but who made sport of the dreamers,
laughed and mocked them into the
limbo of disappointment and failure.
Tangley was the last of these to he
booted out of the fellowship of "Sane
and sensible men" and sent to his
grave a victim of their scorn and'
ridicule. u iew years later he camq
forth to a resurection of reiiouned,
glory as one of the pioneers in a
great scientific achievement. This
is a way the world has,

“It you stand aside just a little
from your party, or your creed, or the
traditions of the elders, you invite
question and rebuke. If you have a
vision oi truth and follow it with
conviction as a divine dream beckon-
ing you on, you are challenging op-
position and suttering, and condem-
nation. The men who have bad
faith greater than the crowd, who
have seen a vision or achievement
that the crowd did not see, who be-
lieve that the truth and the truth one
ly will make them freeithese men
have never had an easy time of it.
But they are the men who have been
and are the leader-s of mankind. This
is their crown of glory.

Let us make it more personal. If.
you car y on toward realization some
of the ideals of devotion and or sacri-
fice and so 1685 that we have tried to
emphasize here, you will not always
have an easy time. You will find
that .llain street, Gopher Pro ie, has

_ headquarters in the town where you

are living, whether the town is large
or small. Heaven forbid that you
should have an easy time! You may
have a happy time. That is more im-
portant. Happiness and ease do not
go together. But sacriﬁce and serv—
ice, on an upward way, ioritt the
crown of happiness for a worth while
life.

conform to the laws oi nature. if
you want to lll'e#1i\'e—live I say,
(not merely to go to the movies and
read the Sunday newspaper) you
must also conform to the lalvs oi na-
ture. These principles that Christ
put into iormulation when he spoke
to the multitude on the mountain side
are also laws of nature, They are
so lust as truly as the laws in ac-
cordance with which man has been
able to make a machine that flies.
They are not a system of ethics. They
are more than that, They are the laws
of life brought out of the infinite
realm of truth and spoke for all time
and for mankind.

He stated that the law or love is
valid in the nature of things and then
said, "But how many who claim to her
Christians believe it? if the law
or love is lalld in the nature of
things, then ‘lol'e your allemies,’ is
valid in dealing with the problems of
social and national liic. If the law
or love is valid, then also is the
coinandment of Jesus, 'bless them
that curse you, do good to them that
hate you, and pray for them that des-
pitefully use yoll.’ These are hard
sayings, but the modern up to date
psychologists will tell you that they
have their sources in truth, that they
are capable of scientific demonstra-
tion. Modern psychologis will as-
sure you that the way to achieve hare
lmony dutliol'del' is to act under the
[inpiration or the law or lovc, rather-
than the fed-up emotion oi hate. To
hate your enemy, personal or nations
al, only accumulates hate and intens'
lfies it. To meet cur-sing with cu .
ting \lolates all the laws of progress
and civilization. To return evil tor
evil only magnifies the evil."

President Minn made the point that
we accept much theological dogma
and then refuse to accept Christ's
statement, "Love your enemies.” Hc
continued, “We need to cultivate the

“mint are you going to do with

late him to charity organizations, 507

is‘a crime against truth.

“Are you going to call him a lleak»

“He was the mastor patriot ot the

Once Toledo had a nuisance,
a tract of swamp land near
the lake, a breeder of mos-
quitoes, foul odors and fogs,

But an automatic

station, equipped

pumping
with motors

made by the General Electric
Company, turned the swamp
into dry landaand abolished
the menace to the city.

This is one example of what

electricity can do.

As you

meet life’s problems, think of
electricity as a valiant and

ever-ready ally.
