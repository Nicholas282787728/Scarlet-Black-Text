Practicality of Religion Is Subject. of Talk
To Members of Graduating Class at the

Congregational

The words that have been filling my
heart and hand during the recent
days are those that i hate used in the
program as an address to tire class,
especially the second sentence: “I aiii
Alpliti and Omega, the beginning and
the end. the ﬁrst and the lust." They
are among the closing words ol that
great vislpu tbatjohn saw on the
island of ratmos as related to us in
the book of Revelation. We think oi
them as a vision. .Let me say to you
they are a vision of reality. They
come to us as an expression of
reality. When John saw this vision,
those words were a prophecy: they are
still a prophecy, to be silre, of an un-
iolding truth, becoming moi-e evident
as the years go nn.—a truth that is re—
newins itseli today after twenty cen-
turi And even though twenty Cen—
turies have passed. the world today i
dimly realizing those words as truth,
and their ultimate application to the
interests and problems, the \evcl‘ydny
problems of human life.

Jesus the Master says, “I am the
Alpha and omega, the beginning and
the end. the first and the last." And
those words are true. Life air-u the
teutui. s has vindicated his words,
both “hell'life has failed to accept
them, and also again when liie has are
copied them. tBllt as i think or these
in is. i think also of a beautiful pas—

~c in the “(‘l‘ito" of Plato, where
Socrates talks to his friends who want
him to release himself from prison
and escape lroni prison and so escape
death. The voice or the law appears
before Socrates personiﬁed, and the
voice tells him that it is his iiir . not
to escape from prison, but stay wher-
he i ,ip obedience to the law, an
Socrates says in obedience to his
friends. “Lei. me then. dear Crito, to

Practical people from the beginning;

like Socrates, have heard the Divine
have heard the voice of God. it has
_ﬁllerl tliem.so that they could hear
nothing else. And those people who
have heard the voice of God have been
the healers and the savioiti-s and the
leaders of the race.
‘ 1 do not speak of religious leaders;
I speak of the leaders of the race.
Such dreamers, and seats, acting on
'drcams,that have become convictions
of the practical people. the leaders of
the -orld‘s thought and ot the world’s
'civ zotion. Such people have been
the creating geniuses in the World's
life. they have been the practical men.
rrdcticol men, so-celled. have been
forgotten. still the have marched on
at the head or the p cession oi civilie
zation through the centuries. They
are the ones that have given inspirae
tion. they are the ones that have given
momentum to progress. And let me
say to you that Jesus is a great
Dreamer, the greatest Dreamer of all.
idle Dreamer that saw really before
others say it, that proclaimed it to
the world proclaimed it and is still
pit-oclaining it, And the world is
beginning to realize that the Dreamer

The task or this generation. of other-
generations. is to see and to under—
stand What he says. The task of
‘lhls generation is to bring Christ out
to the open, to introduce and interpret
him among men as a seeing, as a say-
ing, as a healing power. Tire words
oi.the seer must lie translated into
terms adapted to the understanding of
the 20th century. The words or the
man of Gallllce must he universalized.
There has been created, has come to

the world, a supreme moment in the
history of the race All nations are

health and order in this world not by
way of creed. not only by the way ol
chutch, bitt in direct application to
liie in every phase of its onward go»
illg. Oh, there have been many ill»
torpretations of the life of Jesus
anion; interpreters of Jesus, according
to this or that view, or this or that
way of interpreting him. What is
new needed is a Christ Universal, out-
side of organizations its such, outside
of creed as such, a. Christ its the i:-
gl-essive practical lender in this
Work-a-dny World of ours. We must‘

learn, We that are here, that Chrisu is
‘Truth. that Christ is life and saving

power in every phase of life; if not,
their he is not the Savior of the world.
The time has come, is now her
when we need to take stock of our-
selves and determine whether or not
we are citizens of a Christian nation
in fact, or only so in name If we
, measure ourselves by the fundamental
principles illustrated by the life all

(in st, where are we? What is our
classiﬁcation? What is our grade? is
it A. or C, or D, per lance? We must
iask ourselves ii Ch 'stianity. Christ's
principles, are something for the
church and the few pious souls who go
to church more or less regularly; or it
the church is simply a recruiting sta-
, lion on the great highway of life. Did
lesus live in the world to found the
institution which we cdll the Church.
or to become the eiicrs' ‘ g liic force
in a progressive cir 'ttion nndiug it-l
sell in God We must ask ourselves
this question with renewed clnllha,‘
The church is a power center, it any
,tiilng, to urge, to push, to project, the
principles of Christ into universal -
nd to prove that
agents under God.

The best thing I can do for you
today, is to help you to understand
that Jesus Christ is handing you the,
saving and sure principle or life's suc-,
ess. of your life's success. He is ouf.‘
in the open, on the open road with you,
and will go with you, if you will have
it so. You do not have to go any»,
where to ﬁnd him. He is here. He
oliers the rule of lite to you and
through you to your town, to your
State. to your counti , and to the
world. I say. the world. I mean, the
world.

There is a kind of provincialisrn
which assumes this place is some-
what apart. Let me say to you that
it is a, part oi the great procession of
,liie. The principles or life are just
the same here as they are on the other-
side of the world, or anywhere. The
principle of living, of society of gov~
ernment, is as compelling here as any—
wher and what we do and think are
contributions to the cumulative l'e-
stilts which mean, it we do our part,
a better order-ed world. Do not be
provi cipai. The underlying nnive ,
sai principles of the lite of Jesus is
challenging you to largeness. -

central point of that man's talk? Well,
it was diplomacy in terms of the prin—
ciples of Jesus Christ, much to the
astonishment of a great many vanilla!
He insisted upon Christian prillciple‘

as applicable-to the problems of th A
day. That was the Ambassador from i

they were the only principles that
would restore and save this people,

today.

among many other things, that ChllSr

concrete procedure. as a basis for our

They are primary in the great business

stand. Some one may say that
politics has lost s soul. I disagree
with him. Politics has not had any
soul, Politics has lost its common
sense. We need not ask as yet about
the soul. Politics does not exercise
common sense in dealing with the
great problems of national and world
life. One really great leader could
set the world aflame for progress.
Lincoln made politics a supreme
moral adventure. and the world pays
him homage fbr that adventure. What
were his holding principles? Study
them out for yourself. But you have
to look to Christ tor them. You will
ﬁnd, when you study, that he had some
glimpse, and a very deep and a very
abiding one, of those words of the
Christ, “I am the way." That is why
people everywhere today, the world
