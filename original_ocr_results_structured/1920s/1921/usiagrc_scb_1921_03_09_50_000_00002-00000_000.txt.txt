, TRADITIONS
I Once more talk is heard on the
:campus of holding the soon—senior
:bimuuet and the treshmnndunlor psi-—
12".

These affairs were skirted many
years ago. The junior-freshman par-
:ty. was given by the juniors in honor
of the treshmen, as an introductory
compliment to the new Class, and the
soph scnior banquet acted as

a. return of the compliment, and was

the ﬁrst of the farewell parties to the _

outgoing class.

These traditions, while the carry-
ing out of the customs is not of any
ispecial pleasure aside from the senti-
meht involved, are. of long standing,
‘md should be kept up. They are two
‘of the few real Ll'aditious that have
been handed down to us which in—
clude the whole student body.
