log out only when Daugherty sprinted
the last hundred yards. They had been
genci1lly conceded the ﬁrst two plac-
es as the long grind of the two mile
race was theil specialty last spring.

It remained for Mcllrath, a sopho—
‘lnol’e, to spring the surprise of the
meet and upset the dope by winning
third place. Stepping to the front iii
the ﬁrst hole, he held his position and
ﬁnished in thild place without being
‘pushed. Reece and Miller staged a
pretty race for fourth place. They
ran the last lap on almost even teinis,
but oil the straight away Miller gained
the advantage and won out.

The time fol the race was 20 min-
utes, 4.5 seconds over the so; mile
course, which is comparatively bet-

in 1919 over a 3 mile cour.se

A great deal of interest has been
taken in cross country this year and
Doc” l-luri feels that the meet was a

success although the time was not ex—i

eeptional. The ﬁeld which stalted the

‘mce was the largest which has ever‘

participated ill a urinnell home cross
country meet and only three of the
eighteen starters failed to ﬁnish.
Daugherty, Higley, McIlrath, Mile

dual with Drake here next Saturday.‘

The ability of the Des Moines Institu»

INTEBSUSIETY DEBATE
SEHTES IN DESEMBEIT

Intercollegiate Question Chosenl
for Local Forensics—Many
Varsity Men Back.

TUnicn the intercollegiate question was
chosen as the-subject for the inter
society debates to be held some time
about the middle of Decembel. The
,question, as stated is: “Resolved, That
Congress should enact Legislation,
similar in Principle to Part Two of
the National Insurance Act of 1911 of,
01 eat Britain, Establishing Compul
'Sm'y Employment Insurance in the
United States, Constitutionality Cou-
,‘ccdedx'

There will be four debates this year,
as usual. Each society having two
lcaliisdn the ﬁeld, an ariiimative and
a negative. Final arrangements as to
judges have not been completed yet,
but it is thought that the one judge
system that was so successhllly em
ployed ii_i the freshman debates 1
year, will be used.

The Chi-estomathio Society won the
debate series last year, and will again
be favorites for high iiouo .. besides
ltlie two Voglcr brothers they have sev.
eral strong men from the freshman
team.

Perhaps the next in line will be In
stitute which has iour Honor “G” tic

by Timber-lake, Roivll on, and Harsh

Ionian has one lIonoi- “G” mun, van
Dam, and several [reshluen of last
year who promise to make things
warm for their opponents. Barnes,
Kelly and Porter are the veterans in
the Forum camp that also has fresh-
man debaters of merit.

The debates this year promise to be
exceptional in quality and rivalry be—
