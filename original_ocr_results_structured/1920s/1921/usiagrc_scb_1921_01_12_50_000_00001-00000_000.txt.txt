way over the per capita average
necessary to put the proposition
across, according to Miss Sweney to—
day.

This iund will be added to the $40,-
,000 alleady on hand from tho iaculty
pledges made betol-e Christmas, and
now makes a total ol over $17,000, or
nearly hali oi the total on hand, with
only a little over 120 people on the
campus—seniors and faculty—suba
scribing. Tile seniors who have not
subscribed will be seen immediately,
and little diiiiculty is expected in get-
lting the iull quota out oi the entire
class.

Led by Kenneth Vinsel, football,
basketball, and track star, class en-
thusiasm was at its height during the
meeting, Speeches were made by
lKenneth Geddes, who explained the
lquotas and methods of subscribing,
land suggested ways at laising the
lpledges ,and by Ruth Condon, who
outlined a number or reasons ior sub-
lsori ng. she urged the senior class
to over-subscribe their quotas because
it they didn't the junior class has
threatened to outdo them. Class 11--
lValry in the drive has already been
started, and juniors were quick to
state that anything that the seniors
subscribed would quickly oversub-
scribed by the junior class.‘

_ Due in Five Years
Subscriptions were made in the
llarln oi pledges due in iive years,
providing ior iive annual payments.
The average subscription irom the
seniors so far is a little over 5130 per
student. This quota is ﬁgured on the
basis oi $100 for the women, and $1.50
minimum tor the men.

Geddcs, in presenting the subject
pointed out the fact that ior an aver—
age of $150 ior the men, a man
would give $30 per year, which
would make about one weeks salary
,cut of the year, “It is hard to see why
ztny man should not have the moral
lcolll‘itge to lace the world with that
slight debt iaclng him, especially
when he considers what his work has
accomplished. We are all ’part or

‘We \\'ele Gl‘inllellluus. The shame
would he too great, because we halve
the Dowel to set the example that will
lput this thing across.”

“’heu told of the amount of the
senior pledge, Chairman Payne of the
faculty endowment committee said,
“I Want to congratulate the whole
,class on the wondcrlol showing it
lulude, If the rest 0! the school will
’only rise to the spirit set tor by this
clrtss, the success of the dr hath
