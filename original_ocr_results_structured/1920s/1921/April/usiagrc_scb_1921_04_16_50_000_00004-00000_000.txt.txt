They were standing in the

eyes were bright as they gazed upon
her lowing beauty. she were a gown
cut daringlr low and at .r deep purple,
against which color hor inll, soltly
cuu'cd neck and shapel, arms showed
ducziugll‘ white. tier cheeks nerc
ilushed, and their pinhne, shading
into the white or her neck were as the
delicate tintings tound only in apple
blossoms. Her opalesceut c)cs rairly
glowed, and such strange, unnatural
ﬁres leaped troin their depths that he
was fairly awed by the sight of them.

How he loved her! And yet she
could never be his. Oh, the tragedy
or it: But, strange to say, he didnt
care. l-le,couldn't care. it wasn't in
him to care. Alas, they were only
illustrations.

k WhO Was Moseley?

\

E was a young Oxford man, only twenty-seven when

he was killed at Gallipoli. Up to his time, man had

nevervsecn the inside of an atom. He turned the

X-rays on matter—not ﬁguratively but literally—and made

them disclose the skeleton of an atom just as certainly as a

surgeon makes them reveal the positions of the bones of the

body. Moseley proved that all atoms are built up of the

same kind of matter. He saw, ioo, just why an atom of
copper is diffcrcnt from an atom of gold.

Atoms are built up of electrons. Each atom consists of
a nucleus, a kind of sun, with a certain number of electrons
grouped about it, like planets. Moseley actually counted
the number of electrons of all the metals from aluminum
to gold. ’

When you discover what gold is made of or a new fact
about electricity, you Open up new possibilities for the use
of gold or electricity. For that reason the Research Labora«
tories of the General Electric Company are as much con-
cerned with the “how" of thingsiatoms and electrons, for
instance—as they are with mere app ations of the electric
Current.

Hence Moselcy’s work has been continued in the Re-
search Laboratories, with the result that more has been
learned about matter. How does water freeze? What is
lead? Why are lead, iron, gold and tungsten malleable?’
Such questions can be answered more deﬁnitely now than
ten years ago. And because they can be answered it is
possible to make more rapid progress in illumination, in
X—ray photography, in wireless telcgraphy, and in elec-

trical engineering as a wholc.

There would have been no coal-tar industry without the
vast amount of research conducted in organic chemistry,
and no electrochemical industry without such work as Sir
Humphrey Davcy’s purely scientiﬁc study of an electric
current’s effect on caustic potash and caustic soda. Sooner
or later research in pure science always enriches the world
with discoveries that can be practically applied. For these
reasons the Research Laboratories of the General Electric
Company devote so much time to the study of purely
scientiﬁc problems. ’
