He directed it hiinseli and plays the
lending role.

.lncltic Coogan, one 01 the greatest
fin . ever Illutle in the Search ior

“Charlie, JuIIio " 2t name which
Chaplin gave him himself.
Edna Purviance, whose beauty and
general acting ability made her such

“THE GIRL FROM NOWHERE.”
The two popular screen favorites.
Cleo Madlson and Willred Lucas, are
to be seen in a remarkable picture of
the rugged northwest at the Colonial

Girl From Nowhere” is the name of
the new photodl‘ama.
Cleo Madison has long been recog<
nized as one of the most beautiful W0—
men on the screen. She possesses a.
face which loses none at lts beauty
when it is photographed. Her feat-
ures are as Wonderfully’clear and is
ﬁnely former] as those of a Greek
statue, It is this type of beauty.
coupled with her we gifts as an
tcress, that has placed her name in
the front rank of great motion picture
artists.

Wilfred Lucas is not only an actor
of recognized worth, but is a director
with big things to his credit. For sev-

eral seasons he acted under the direc<
tion of David W. Grilfith and lat-Er was
made director of one of Mr. Griffith’s

companies.
