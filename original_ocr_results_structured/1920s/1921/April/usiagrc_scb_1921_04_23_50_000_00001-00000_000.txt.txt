The Glee Club has a splendid col-
lection of voices this year. the parts
are well balanced and the quality of
the voices blend well. To the drrec-
tor. Professor D. E. Peck. belongs the
credit for the splendid interpretations.
the expression with which the various
numbers were sung. and the wonder»

given without instrumental accom-
paniment and the intonation was
nearly perfect. The spirit with
which the club entered into the music
insured the success of the concert.

the Sea." showed the higll musical
ability of the group Hall Clovis as

according to the latest information
from the athletic department. The
Pioneers will compete in the half mile
relay. university class. as has been
the custom in the past but will not
enter the other relays. The half mile
team will be composed of Vinsel. Wine
ter. Reece. and Paulo. All of these
men but one are veterans and will be
able to give stiff competition to the
other entries. ‘
Dope Scln'ce
Al. present it is hard to dope th
meet because of the fact that it is
practically the first outdoor meet for
any of the schools entered. Also a
great many institutions sutfered greet
losses to their teams thru graduation
last June and are not sure enough of
their new material to be able to dope
their chances. .
However it is safe to predict that in
the two mile relay. university class.
Arnes will be one of the strongest
contenders on the track. Ames won

ithis event against Notre Dame and

Kansas university on on indoor track
this season. The Iowa State two
mile team is made up of experienced
veterans who undoubtedly will put
the stifrest ltind of a pace for their
courpetiturs to follow.
Cornell Strong
in the college class Cornell college
will be strong in the mile rela'y and
they are counting on George “shinny“
urotnall. Olympic star. to be able to
make up any loss and win for them.
At any rate Cornell is not the only
college that has aspirations for a win
in that race and it should be a fight
to the lust.
The Pioneer half mile tealn if it
has a fair brealt should be able to rim
a consistent relay anti campus opin-
ion is strong in its belief that Paulu
if touched off anywheres near even
with his competitors, will be able to
win for Grinnell.
Special Promises album

The special hundred promises to be
more of a thriller as the time draws
near. Carnegie Tech has entered
John Kelley in the hundred and as he
is considered one of the fastest dash
men in the East many are backing
him as the favorite. Kelley’s entry
makes this dash talre on a national
aspect instead of merely :r middle
western. as this is the first time any
ca‘stcrn school has entered the Drake
'Reluys. But when one takes into cone
'siilel'zltlou Pfiulll's time in his indoor
meets this year he is colrcccded a
good chance to brcnlt into the scoring
column and possib . will the event.
