A large number oi studenhs have
been playing golf already this spring.
Little is known oi the experience and
the ahility oi the players to drive the

a minimum number of strokes. Among
those who die playing at the country
club are Dana Johnson, ’23, Ross Wale

None or the characters in “Scratch

the Strand Sunday and Monday he
hove quite as you expect them 1.0.
There is a hero who periorms noble
ilccds oi valor on behali oi the Lady-
in-distress~and gets nothing for his
pains but a “thunk-you" and a grate-
fill sinilc. There is a villian who in-
hclcs spaghetti from a tin pot and
wears a paper dicky ior a shirt~he
surrender to the hero at the insig-
niilcant p e oi a whaehed shin and
a pohe in the ribs. There is a Jealous
Husband whn storms and raves like
most J, H.‘s do—hut turns out to he
the best sort or a guy in the world,
perhaps a darned sight better than the
Hero. And there is a LadyAln—Disti'ess
who, for the iirst time in the annals
oi literature, drama, or movia, is
sensible enough to reiuse an lnviln»
tinn to visit a man’s rooms¥thereby
mining a pcriectly good situation. We
warn you not to come to "Scratch My
Back" if you expect the usual screen
comedy. Hut ii you like new, differ-
ent things. you’ll love this innovation
in modern comedy drama. Rnpert

Goldwyn Picture.
