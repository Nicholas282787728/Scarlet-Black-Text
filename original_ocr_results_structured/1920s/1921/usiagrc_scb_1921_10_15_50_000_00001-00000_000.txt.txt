HlﬂﬂlHDﬂ MARTIN

Rich, Powerful Voice in
Operatic Numbers.

Singing before a capitcuy house in
Hel‘l'lck cllftpel Friday evening, Rice
cm'do Martin, hailed as America’s
greatest tenor, won [or himself it
place in the hearts of his Gl'inuell ztu-
dience He has a voice rich in tone,
and of Wide range, and the audience
called him back time aitcr time im-
incores.

Operatic Selections Appeal

“'ell known in, operatic work. his
selections from this ﬁeld were the
most appealing. Among the best of
these was Puccini's "Tl‘a. Vilo belle”
[mill “Million Lescant" “E'lucevan le
Stelle" from "Tosca.” also by Puccini.
and its his closing Dumber, “Al-lose"
from "Pagliacci" by Leoncavallo.
W 011 showed the great range and
power of his voice.

“Sea-Fever” by Ireland, With Words
by John Maseﬁeld, and "Before the
Dawn" by Chadwick were two of his
most Charming selections. In “ ly
Old Kentucky Home," one of his ens
cures, he tested his voice quality and
his power over the audience. During
the ﬁrst pal‘t of the program Mr. Ma '-
lin’s audience was only mildly ap-
prcciative, but as the evening pro-
grossed, and the real beauty and pow-

Develop New Attach

During the past week Coach'sallllds .
ers has developed an open, speedy, at.
tack with which he hopes to get
around the ends at the heavy Wash-
ington team. A series at passes has
also been introduced which should be
good ior substantial gains if'thcy can
be worked successiully.

In last Saturday's game Washing-
ton showed itself rather weak in both
tackling and breaking up passes. Un-
less they have corrected these faults
during the past week. the combination
of open play and aerial attack which
the Pioneers will undoubtedly use
should prove very eﬂective. How»
ever, if the ﬁeld is not dry and fast.
the team odds will favor the heavy
Piker aggregation.

)Iillor Accidents Bother

Grinnell came out oi the Ames game
with iew serious injuries but have
minor accidents which may prove
more more serious than expected.
Walters who has been playing a good
game at half back, is suffering irnm
