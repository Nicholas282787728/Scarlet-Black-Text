Professor Morize Says Burdens of
Peace Hove Fallen
0n France.

"France is in one of the most dan—
gerous times of her history", snid;
Pralcssor Andre Morize, of Harvard‘
University, in a lecture in Herrick
chapel auditorium last night. “More
is at stake now than during the war,
her whole history depends on the
present," according to Professor:
Morize. ,

Professor Morize gave a general re-
view of conditions in France today,
showing some of the things about
France that are not commonly known
in this country. France does not need
propaganda today. when the treaty
of peace was signed, Germany was
supposed to give up, and that was ex
pected to close up the war, according
to Morize, but in reality France has
had to bear the consequences of what
has happened ever since loll, and
unless she holds her own now, she
will no longer be the victor. rler
Greatest tasks now are the reconstruc-
tion or the country, of the moral life.
and 0! financial affairs.

“During the war 5,000 railroads
were destroyed, 10,000 acres of farm—

sreat losses with the result that she
has been slower than the olher coun-
tries in setting ‘a start. At present
her railways, canals, and highways
are rebuilt and some of the factories
but she still has reached only 70%
at her prewar basis.

"France's war debt is 47 billion dol-
lars and at present they are issuing
paper money which is a very great
risk. Her taxes mire 13-20% of the
personal income while Germany's
only 943%. However they have felt
the need of teachers and have raised
their wages 100% with the result that
nmny are entering that profession
again.”

With the approach of warm weaLh~
er, and the concurrent growing of‘
grass and general change in the ap-
pearance of unture, thoughts should
turn to the best ways or helping my
keep the campus beautiful. One of
the greatest assets ofla college is a‘
beautiful canavus. It is the ”front
yard" of the college, and if it is well
kept it shows the general type of
people in the college, just as the con-
dition of the grounds of a.
home show to a great extent his char—

man’s '

acter.

Students do not seem to have grasp— l
ed the importance ofltheir part in‘
keeping the front yard clean. The re-
fusal of students to keep to the paved-
walks has resulted in making thel
inner quadrangle of the central can]
pus look like the ground of a publicl
school. Footpaths crisscross from one
end to the other, and grass canoe:
grow. .

Another trait that is not oummoni
in the bestrregulated households isl
the habit of throwing garbarge out ofl
the window. To look at the grounds
around the dormitories one cannot
help but wonder where the inmstcsl
came from,

We cannot help but thlnk that the
college grounds are more than mere
public thoroughfares. Certainly they
reﬂect the nature of the students.
Not only that, but it is not nearly so
pleasant to live in unsightly sure
roundlngs as it is to live in a. beauti-
lul place. Nature has done its best;
let’s have a good looking home.

OUR OWN ENGLISH LAXGUAGE
(From Iowa State Student)

A note was struck in the convoca-

thruout the country in college opinion '

and Public comment of later Mlssl
cation brought forcibly to the \front
a weak point in the modern educations

al system among colleges as a. Whole,

 

in commenting upon the need for a
clearer expression thl'u‘ the English.
language on the par-t at our college
graduates, and college trained men
and women.

A recent editorial comment carried
in these columns referred to the in,
l
ones self thin the clear, concise and
well selected use of Wolds. The de-
tection of frequent flaws in we speak

persons nowadays, as well as the ap~
parent lack of basic knowledge of
grammar has meant much or,little in
a. large number of cases to graduates
of American colleges, In the rush of
securing technical training in the four
short years of higher education, come
of these principals of speaking and
writing are very much neglected.

It is impossible to require a thorn
training in English of every student
today, The task is too big, and in
my instances wholly unnecessary.
But the crowding out of attention to

lettervwl'iting.
arid common grammatical fundamen-
tals, has already been noﬁced by
many recent graduates from our
schools. One person has expressed
himself as of the belief that every
graduate of a modern college or uni—
versity should have tuken one course
in public speaking, and one course in
the lundadnentala of journalism.
Knowledge ot,,news Values, and the

power to express ideas in concrete

 

be known as a Student Advisory Com- 1

 

form, is as Valuable an asset to a ,

alone in theil actions, for, according
to Professor Baldwin of the Univer-
sity of Iowa, there are 123 institutions

:in the United states which have for—
'rnal honor systems ‘

"In the organization at Cornell.
stress is laid on the Honor Committee
which consists of five members elec»
ted cacti year by fbe entire student
body. It is the duty of this committee
to hear and try all cases of cheating
submitted to them. These hearings
are held in private and each student
has the right to appeal for a second
trial, and also, a public one, if he so

desires. ﬁnally, the decisions and

,the verdicts are sent to the dean of

, 1 .
:stther of me Sate board of edunthe colcge and all records are de
posited with the registrar.

“Such a system eliminates the ne-
cessity of pructors at the examination
at Cornell. It means a square deal

lto the student who is honest in his

actions with the faculty and With his
fellow students. If Droperly executed

lit means the expulsion of the man

who is in ng his own morals and
deceiving the University faculty, by
cribbing” It leads to further expan-
sion 01 student self-government."
