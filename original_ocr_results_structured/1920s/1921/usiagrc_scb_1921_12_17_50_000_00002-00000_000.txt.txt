WE MUST FIGHT

0n the Thursday after school starts
following the Christmas holidays the
basket ball team will start out to play
one of the hardest schedules ever ar-
ranged for a Scarlet and Black ag—
gregation. That the men are desei-v.
illgiof oil the support that the student
body- can give theui is undisputed, but
“support” alone is not what the men
want. They ‘want the student body
to show actual FIGHT as they did
toward the end of the football season,

and especially in the Drake game.
The team Will begin the season un»
der difficulties, being handicapped by
the ineligibility of several men until

. the second semester, and also by the

fact that die tirst seven games are
away from home. This is always dis-
couraging to a team, but the Grinueli
ipoters will be given a chance to give
the team on exhibition of fie’nzied en—
thusiasm and the real Grinnell Spirit
at a special pep meeting after chapel
on Wednesday, the ﬁrst day of school
after the vacation. It is also possible
that another big pep meeting in the
evening may be arranged before the
team leaves.

Students are expressing conodence
in coach "Bud” Saunders' ability to
build up a formidable aggregation of
basket tossers, especially with the
bunch of men who are now out. The
Grinnell team will go up against teams
inrtbe Missouri Valley Conleresce
that are stronger than the Scarlet and
Black on paper, and whether or not
coach Saunders' men will be a win—
ning aggregation, a thing for which
all are conﬁdently hoping, will de~
pend on that extra amount of‘ ﬁght
and determination which is not on pa—
per, but of. which the Grinnell Spirit
makes Grinnell men capable,

It will be necessary for both team
and student body'to get this lighting
spirit which at the crucial moment
enables men to put forth almost su-
perhuman efforts for the sake of the
Alma Mater. If the student body gets
the spirit the team can not help but
get it, but il.‘ the team has the spirit
and the students do not then chances
are slim. We believe, however, that
the latter is not and never has been
the case in Grinnell College.
and student body fought together all
through the football season,’and wc
condidently believe that the whole sale
lege will light its way through the
basket ball season. if the spirit is
displayed as it was in the Drake game,
with perhaps even a little more inten»
sity, then the question of whether or
not the 1929 basket ball team will be
a

a winning team will cease to he
questioliiit will he a reality.

Since New Year’s "solutions will

student resolve to do everything in his

power to help the basket ball teamithe’rule is strictly adhered to,

oessfully and Victoriously. There
will then be no doubt as to the out-
come of the test to which the Grins
nell Spirit is Soon to he put.

THOSE ABSENCES
In regulating and controlling the
student lile or any college a certain
number of rules are always necessary.
In the military academy the cadet eats,
SleEps and studies in accordance with

rules.

, 1
higher leaming such as Columbia Uni-

versity we have the other extreme,
where the student lives and works
practically unrestricted by any set
rules. The only requirement is that
he pass the work.

An institution Such as Gl‘inneil must
lie classed in between these two

tremes.
quire the same supervision and roe
striations as do the cadets in the mili-
tary academy, nor on the other hand
is it safe for the (acuity to assume
that every one of the men and Wanda
on here will persevere in thc search
for knowledge without a few rules to‘
make in unpleasant for the sluggard.

it is admittedly possible, however,
for the powers that be to go too far in
arbitrarily regulating student conduct,
and the Scarlet and Black believes, af-
ter consulting the opinions of many
students and weighing the facts in the
case, that the present ruling on an-
seoces is too harsh and is unjust in
many cases. We believe that the rule
should and eventually must be modi-
ded.

It is certain that the principle of the
rule is very beneﬁcial, and since it
has been in operation it has reduced
the number of cuts to a remarkable
extent. In that respect the rule is
altogether to be desired, for we have
no use for the lazy student who dee
liberately and habitually cuts classes.
but when it is applied to absences on
account of" sickness, and absences due
to Dubai-town atbeletic trips, work on
college publications, and similar ac-
tivities which operate to further the
interests of Grinnell it seems unlair
to take burdreamed credit away from
a strident.

Steps have already bees taken to
secure a modiﬁcation of the rule as it
applies tn the athletic men, but the
football and basket ball men are not
the only ones Who feel that they are
not being given a souare deal. It is
true that in some cases they have been
given half cuts, but even these ()0th

sickness, and who makes up all of
the work after going back to classes.
successfully passing all examinations,

up. A; student who is

is just as much entitled to his credit
as any other student. It seems as if
the faculty has placed too high a pie
mium on classroom work alone. Work
on the c\ollege publications sometimes
necessitates absences from class. and
these are entitled to exemption from
the rule just as much as the absences
of the athletic men, since both classes
of men are furthering the interests of

Griilnell College.

AS yet the faculty committee has
made no deﬁnite promises, merely say-
ing that ii the student will take any
particular case oi individual hardship
of injustice tn this committee direct,
that they will not allow any injustice
to be done. If this is the case, then
the fear of the rule is purely a theme
UCEtl one, but there should be no basis
[01‘ a theoretical fear. The committee
admits that hardships and injustice
under the ruling are 'possiblc, but ere
eruption from its provisions is at their
discretion. DUES this promote the mist
kind of feeling between students and
faculty? _

No credit has been taken as yet, and
can not be until one end of the semeSr

 

ter, but when that time comes, and it

deal with a good many justly indignant
students. Now if the rule is not strict-
ly adhered to, and ii the faculty com-
mittee makes the many modiﬁcations
which it should make, then a great
deal of apprehension on the part or
the students would be ouieted by an
announcement of a modiﬁcation or the
rule belore the end of the semester.
The committee has practically admit-
ted the possibility of harm being done
by the iule as it now stands, but what
is the use of having a rule it it doesn’t
mean what it says?

What Do You Think?

To the “one who wants to know":—
The boys of Grinnell were out for a
time,
They stole a goat, and hence this
rhyme.
The girls of the school had gone to
bEdr
But we doubt if some had covered
their head.
When from their dreams they Wei-a
awoke,
And all was caused by tho "Bah" of a
goat.
Windows went up and then went down,
They thought a Stank yard hid moved
to town.
The Smell Wasn't like the odor of
pines.
'Cause it best a farm yard in rainy
times:
While down the cloister of Cottage
Five
They thought that some one had been
skinned alive.
Then Viola was arouse from her beauty
sleep
And found it was only aplnintive bleat.
Poor Nanny was ushered out of the
door,
Never to visit the quad no more.
These are the words that the keeper
did shout.
”Buys will be boys. and this 1 don‘t
doubt,
But, in view of the facts, these things.
i must say, ‘
nave gone too far in such a. way:
I don’t mind keeping chickens out of
harm.
But we can't have goats on a chicken

have come together on the vital sub-
Ject of fortiﬁcations-in the Paciﬁc, the
outposts to remain in status quo. This
settlement seems to be generally sat-

CONFERENCE AS SEEN DIRECT

WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.70ne or
Elihu Root's lavorite sayings refers to
the dog who kcph on going, leg over
leg, until he arrived at Dover. That
is, the dog. followed the main«road
as expeditiously as he could by means
of his ordinary means of locomotion.
lSo this conterence continues to make
progress by thc'only means of loco—
motion known to conferences This
week it has passed another important
milestone.
ships is no longer just a proposal by
the United Suites, it is a fact agreed
upon by the great sea powers.

As the battleship and battle cruiser
are the oflcnsive unit of sea power,
the three nations have struck hands
in practice as well as theory against
competition in offensi c new builds
ing and accept the practice as wall as
the principle of the defensive. More
over, following the four powers treaty
of last week in which the signatories
agreed to respect one another’s island
possessions. it has been also agreed
this week not to loitify any turmer
the islands in the neighborhood of the
Asiatic Sea, All this would seem ﬂ-
nally to guarantee the peace of the
Paciﬁc and to dismiss from our minds
rumors of wars and fear of wars be.
tween America and Japan.

But not too fast—not all has been
said on this subject of naval ratios.
other features or the naval program
must he settled before there is a treaty
covering the limitauon of naval arm»
ament as a whole. France and Imly

The naval ratio (or capital _

 

have not yet agreed to the ratios. Even
about capital ships Britain is think-
ing of the security or her own and
not of the Asiatic Sea. France is
separated from her only by the Brits
ish Channel and France and Italy are
athwart her sea route across the Medi»
terranean to India. She wants to be
as secure a mistress of the European
sen hs Japan of the Asiatic and
America of the American seas.

This brings up the submarine, that
assassin at merchant ships which forc-
ed Britain to short rations during the
war and threatened allied success. The
British people do not forget their hun-
gry and anxious days when British ba-
bies went without milk Unlike the
airplane, the submarine is not a weap-
on whole development has any rela-
tion to peace progress It is purely
an instrument of war Small nations
see it as a means of defense against
greet nations. Britain sees the dangr

er of a European combination which
will use the submarine to stab her
merchant ships to death and take
bread from her mouth. She is ready
to scrap every submarine that she
possesses—she would abolish the sub-
marine.

‘That is her appeal and the appeal
she will make to the world from the
Pulpit of this conference. She has
no fears of us. She is content with
the equality of the American and, Brit-
ish navies if France and Italy Want
naval ratios which will make them as
strong as she ls. This she will resist.

When we have the naval ratio treaty
that will make the second treaty. One
labout Yap may make a third; the
fourth will concern China. When we
have the fourth complete the work of
the conference will be complete and
presented to the public opinion 01 the
rworld and the United States.
