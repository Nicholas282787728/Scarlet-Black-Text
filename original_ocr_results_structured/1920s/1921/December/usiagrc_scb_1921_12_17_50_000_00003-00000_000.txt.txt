Round About

BY GOLLY

Did you see the Yuletide Malteaser?
Find mything in it about Christmas?
You're good if you did. But the latest
cut did some good. It is rumored that
those near the rear of .the chapel
found it o! advantage Inst night
while Pompelia breathed her last.

After listening to Pi‘exy yesterday
morning in chapel we think we' have
some chance yet. In fact, if We ever
got anyihing above 0 We would think
the world's end had came, and we
wouldn’t have a chance to be great.
But then, we could be an A Student
ir we just wanted to.

Only four days till the Christmas
danceibllt exnrns in the interim.
Quoting a well known pruiessor ui
history: "On time! What is Hell to
a pig!”

This came in my heap of morning
mail:

Why don't your paper run a question
department? I have a question that
has been bothering me tor the past
ten days. Yes, even so lung as thatl
it is very- close to my heart, Golly-,l
and therefore I am writing to you be-
cause I know you have sympathy and
understanding. But ﬁrst before 1 (ell‘
You my question, 1 must relate somel
history Ten days ago I met a lovely
young creature of the fairer sex. I fell l
in love with her at once. Now, with
only 51:: shopping days left until
Christmas, tell me. Golly, what shall
1 buy her for Christmas?" A. E. F.
Dear A. E. R:

We would suggest the buck entitled
“The Greatest Thing in the World."
We are sure she will appreciate the
wonderful message in this book.
