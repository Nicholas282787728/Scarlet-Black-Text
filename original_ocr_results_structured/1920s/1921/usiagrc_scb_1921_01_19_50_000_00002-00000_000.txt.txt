ELIGIBILITY

Much criticism is being constantly
aroused over the question at whether
or not it is too easy ta stay in Grin—
hell, Many think that tau little Work
is required, or else that the passing
grade level has been placed too law.

Most students make the mistake or
trying m compare their own college
with ’other colleges, when they know
no more about other colleges than
what they have heard from ri-iends
attending other schools, or what they
have deduced from reading accounts
ct other schools.
may be obtained or other colleges by
this method, it must he remembered
that the situation in every college is
a little ditierent from, that in Grin-
nell or any other institution.
conditions enter into the tormation
at life and standards at grades and
work at colleges, and to really know
these conditions, a person must come
into direct contact with the campus
in question

To test out tha charge that class
work and grade levels were not on a

high standard here as in larger uni-5

versities, scarlet and Black represem
mtives have interviewed a number of
professors here who have been con
nected with other institutions betel-e

coming here. The opinion of those

interviewed w s that Grinnell workl

is equal to that in any school, and is
on a higher level than that required
in most of the colleges and uniyel'sie
ties in which they have taught.
was pointed out however that perhaps
the reason for thinking that Gi-innell
work might be too easy was because
many were inclined to take stories or
those spending long hours in labora-
tory work in professional schools, as
evidence that the average student was
spending much more time on his work
than is really the case.

In spite o: the fact that we are use

sured that our work here is on a level ‘

with that in the best institutions in
the country, and we have only to look
into the ratings given Griuuell credits
in all of the big universities to prove
this, the Scarlet and Black agrees
with those who say that the college
is not quick enough to stop the l'eSl-
deuce in Grinnell or those students
who are unwilling or unable to keep
up with their work. Just Wllilt average
grade the student should be expected
to keep up to stay in scbunl, is difli-
cult to determine, but it is certain
that there have been many students

on the campus who should have been ‘

dismissed long ago because of too

many "conditions" and too little in-‘

terest in work. In larger institutions,
