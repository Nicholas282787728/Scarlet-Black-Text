START READING

During the past few months, pare
tlcularly last spring, many
magazines or the country published

articles discussing the value of a col-

leading

legs education and going into consid—
erable detail in the discussion of the
faults of the modern college or uni—
versity. Everybody took pleasure in
jumping on our present educational
system mdlin condemning the condi—
tions that‘ will allow an educational
institution to turn out such impracti-
cal and dreamy creatures as the pres—
ent day student Indeed, so universal
did the argument become. that the
student himself became almost cone
Vinced of the error of his way and
nearly decided to do something about
the matter. "

Since others have paved the way;
perhaps it will not he amiss to disc
cuss one more shortcoming-failure to
keep in touch with current events
thru the newspapers of the day. Of
course, many will condemn the papers
as scurrilous and extreme, but again
the advocate of the dailies will hasten
to the defense of the modern press
and point the merits» of jurnalism,
Both are right. Many episodes break
into print that are of the highest col-
oring but at the same time the daily
press provides a certain and fairly ac-
curate means or keeping in touch with
contemporary happenings. It has
found a deﬁnite place and no salislac»
tory substitute is available.

The' average college student
blissfully ignorant of matters that con-
cern the national life, as well as in—
ternational affairs. lt is only thru
some happy chance that many of them
become aware of the happenings'of
the day. Engrosscd in the local as—
pect of things, \it is easy to forget to
look beyond and to lose all touch with
outside events. It is this lack of in-
formation that is condemned by the
modern business men and classed as
an outstanding defect in our present
school system.

Accurate knowledge is lit-manned by
the business man and many of the
colleges over the country are coining
to realize this and are makingpi-ovi-

is

siuns accordingly. Many professors are
beginning to include a study of the date
ly newspapers and weekly news digests
as a part of of their regular class
work, encouraging a general reading
by the nature of their assignments.
When the students of the college or
university start reading the papers,
sifting the varying amount of good
materiabfrom the bad, and keeping
abreast of current conditions as they
concern the national welfare, interna-
tional relations, political activities,
the relationship of labor and capital,
and other phases or world nation,
they will have done much to overcome
the handicaps now imposed by uri—
familiarity with every day affairs and
will offset, in a large measure, the
criticism of business and literary men.

COLLEGE CITIZENSHIP

In connection with the suhiect oi
the relationship lhal. LOW“ and col-
lege should bear to each other, it is
easy to moi-aiize on the interest that
the merchants and townspeople should
display in the student body, but there
is another phase of the matter that
plays an equally important allho less
obvius part in such a relationship.
namely lhe duty of the student to the

fairs of the community, social service

What Do You Think

any communication from u nudent, inc
ulty member, alumnus or other under.

his good liith in sending it, but no
name will be printed it the sender to re

nwmarily agree with opinions expressed
ii. communications. The urticlm must be
limited to loo words in length.

Editor Scarlet and Black:

The students around Gl'lllllell are
beginning to realize more and more
that something should he done in re,
mum to our athletics. Judging from
the opinions that have bceiiexpi-essed
they do not have any fault to ﬁnd
with the coaching staff in fact they
seem to agree that we have one or the
ﬁnest in this part of the country.
dolhey doubt that we have a cracking
good team, that should be winning
games by reasonable margins. Never-7
theless something is wrong.

It seems to me that we are losing
games because we have created a state
of mind that makes it hard to do any
thing else but lose. Everybody on
the campus you can hear someone say,
“We’ve got the team and we ought to
win next Saturday but you know we
seem to lose no matter who we play."
No wonder our team loses games: If
the students believe that they can't
win they Wim'l. even if they spend ten
hours a day in practice.

an. the other band I believe that
the team as well as the student body is
guilty of this same lack of conﬁdence.
thii the players speak at the pop
meetings they show it. When they are
on the ﬁeld they appear to hesitate

 

fur tear they will rumble or do Sume-

Nor ‘

thing wrong. They don’t lack ﬁght. A
Grinncll team never does. But they
do lack offensive strength, and there
is only one way to get it and that is
from the student body. All of us in—
cluding the team have got to forget
this ‘bug" about u jinx or had luck.
We've got to ﬁght until we know we
can't lose. The students believe in the
team, but it’s a cinch, they can not do
their share unless the team show that
it has conﬁdence in itself.

It is not my purpose to “bowl" out
the athletes for no one is stronger for
them or realizes their difficulties more
than I. HolveveriI do believe that
they should be willing to look at this
from the side 0[ the students, and i-
gardless of whose to blame for this
"hoodoo" idea, they should try to ﬁght
and cooperate with everyone to over
come it, Let's all pull together. We've
got the Team! -\\‘e've shown our pep!
Let’s show our conﬁdence and we'll
liave a winner. ~Grinnellian.

The announcement that cuts in
physical training count toward the
total of eighteen cuts which are al-
lowed without losing semester credit
brings up a great inconsistency. It
physical training cuts are going to
count against scholastic credit, it is
perfectly- logical then to believe that
there shuld be scholastic credit given
for physical training. There should
he a deﬁnite understanding in regard
to this, so that students who aie will-
fully cutting physical training will not-
be lacking credits in Economics, Else
toi-y, Language or whorev’er thcy need
it.

It is hard to conceive that physical
training has been put upon the same
plane as philosophy but it amounts to
this if it is to count against credit,in
other ﬁelds. If physical exercise is
to Tank with mental exercise, what is
the reason? It should be justiﬁed in
the eyes of the student body, if things
are going to run smoothly for P. T.

There is‘ another inconsistency
which is even more important 31»
though it is limited to ,3. smaller
group of people. A course was drop-
ped after a large class had completed
ﬁve or six weeks work because the
professor had too many other class—
es, There is no reflection oastnpon
the professor, but when these students
wanted to take another course to mairc
the credit which they were losing,

they had to make all the work of the «

other course from the ﬁrst of the year.
It was no fault of the students that
they did not have the work in the oth-
er course, so why should they be made
to do extra workl Dormite,
Editor Scarlet and Block: L
Our apologies to the GI'ilinell police
force. We have often been guilty of
mslring sport of themftind not al—
ways without foundatiou—but it now
appears that but for them we might
not now have even our campus left,
We believe in the spirit of youth,
but not of kidisbness. When we were
kids we used to do such things as
were attempted Monday night, but
when we came to college we tried to
grow up. When a crowd of college

least a fair amount or common sense

but when it reaches the stage where
collegc,iiien—anrl especially Grinnell
men—do not kilo wthe difference has
tween a prank and the rights of [iI'ir

Iii conclusion, isn’t it a'bout tiiric
for all of us to GROW UP?
