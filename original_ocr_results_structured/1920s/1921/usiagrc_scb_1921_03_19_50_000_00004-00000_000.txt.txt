TODAI'S SHORT STORY
By G. llelpus

There was the sheen of silver and
cut glass, the white expanse of the
na’pery, the subdued lights and a hint
of music at another part of the place.
Henry C. Williams, very corrcct in
hisevening dress, was not noticing
any of it. He sat very stiff and
upright in his chair at one of the
small tables. He seemed about to
‘say something, to make a decision,
yet that very decision would probably
affect his life for all time.

He motioned away a waiter who
hovered near. Ide wanted to think
clearly and yet how could be? There
was a Something at the table with
him. Something that was alluring
him and keeping him from thinking
clearly, of making a true decision.
He glanced quickly at this Something
and then looked away. Why could It
be so dangerous? Why could one not
enjoy it and yet not pay the piper?

That Something was far beyond
him secretly felt. The fear of later
unhappiness seized him, tore at the
heart of him. Twisting the cloth be»
heath his fingers with nervous ah—
straction he sat there for sometime.
He closed his eyes. that the beauty of
the Thing before him might not in-
fluence him now. He had decided.

I’ll have to give you up," he said
brokenly. “You’re too rich for a man
like me." ~

Summoning the waiter he turned
the pork roast in question over to

. him and ordered milk toast. For he
was a dyspeptic.

Hard Tests F

By Roscoe Wright .

Gl'lllnell closed a basketball sched
ule Monday in which she lost twelve
of her sixteen intercollegiate cage
contests yet the season was notinany
sense a tailor-e. The reason for the
fact that the Pioneers dropped so
many of their contests lay in the fact
that III. was a unusually good year in
Missouri Valley basketball, and that
Crinucll had a good team in an exe
ceptional year.

Only by the strong Nebraska and
Kansas lives were the Pioneers de-
cisively defeated, and the I—luskers
were forced to the limit to win in
their contests here. The closeness of
the competition in the Pioneer games
must not be forgotten. Drake won
from Grinnell by l and 2-point mar»
gins, Oklahoma took a pair of con»
tests with a lead at 3 points in each
and Ames led by only a points on
their own floor. .

Tour 0116 of smog Tennis

That it was a year of strong Mis-
sou ‘ Valley ouintets there is no ques-
tion. Ames, a team not a serious
contendel'l for the Valley flag, twice
defeated lowai and the Hawkeyes
have furnished the most serious of
competition for the. Big Ten leaders.
Nebraska took her victims from a bit
farther east, defeating Notre Dame
and Colgate two games each during
the current season. .

ilissouri, with a five almost in a’
class by itself even. in such an excel-
lent hasketb'ail year, would undoubt-
edly have made things exceedingly
intel‘esting’lol‘ any Big Ten team. The
Tigers opened negotiations for a post»
season series with chigau, joint
holders of first place in the Big Ten,
but the Wolverines refused as a mat-
ter of Conference policy. Several
sports writers in this section have are
pressed the opinion that Michigan
was wise.

Tllrcc Play Last Game

Annthel“ evidence of the quhlity of'
this year‘s teams lies in the fact that
although Crinuell had a good outlay
of material, only Captain Evans was
mentioned in the Valley honor roll
by most critics. ,

Winter, Evans and Wassenaar play-
ed their last college basketball against
Drake Monday, and their loss will he
keenly felt when the call for nondi—
dates is issued next winter.

Mrs. Tucker Gives
Pleasing Recital

\

Mrs. Collingwood Tucker, who was
in Grinneil during the week under the
auspices of the Entre Nous club, err,
tertained the students in chapel
Thursday with a. Short recital n! Negro
mantation melodies. Mrs. Tucker is
from the southand has made a study
'of Negro hymns besides having had a
"Mammie" who sang to her when a
child. Mrs, Tucker imitated the Ne-
groes even to the tapping of her foot
for accompaniment. Particularly in-
teresting were the hymns, "oh Me,
on My," and “Cruciﬁxion Hymn."

H. s. McGowan closed the meeting
with a brilliant appeal in behalf of
his Alma Mater, and the Alma Mater

address called forth the sentiment of
his hearers for the college.

In closing McGowan announced the
progress of the campaign, stating the
amounts raised in the various dc—

lCritic Likes New Artist’s Hand.
ling of Important Master-
pieces Thursday.

The violin recital given by Erika
.llorini at Herrick chapel Thursday
evening more than fulfilled ’the high
expectations of the largest and most
appreciative audience or the season.

Her entire performance was marked
by an artistry that proved her to bc
a genius. Perhaps the quality that
was most instrumental in captivating
her hearers was‘ the reckless shone
taueity'and the amazing vigor that
that characterized her playing. Tins
was especially evident in the concerto
by Paganini, Zarzyckl's "Mazurka"
and the last number on her program.
"Polonaise in A major” by Wielliaw»
ski.

Miss Mol'lni's splendid bowing, true
intonation and precise attack all gave
evidence of her mastery of technique.
The tact that she is only seventeen
makes the warmth of feeling, inter—
pretation, and imaginative beauty of
her music more amazing although
her youth is evident in her playing of
Bach. Both she and her accompanist,
Ali’ce Morini, whose work at the piano
was excellent, had good stage pies-
cnce devoid of artificiality.

Morini is not only great from the
technical standpoint. she attains a
sweetness and appealing clarity of
tone in softer passages that is a con-
stdnt‘delight. Her program was not
long but it was exacting and at its
close the artist was given an ovation,

dieing forced to return to the platform

again and‘again in response to storms
of applause.

The alld‘iellce‘ l'elused to leave the
house until they had called her back
to the stage four times.

Forty dollars for the endowment

recital of Mrs. Collingwood Tucker-
which was given Wednesday (under
the auspices of the Entre Nous club.
according to an announcement made
by Mrs. H. W. Matldek who had
charge of the affair.

The musicals, which was held in
the drawing room of the Women's
Quadrangle was very pleasing. Mrs.
Tucker‘s rendition of the old planta~
tion folk songs was excellent. she
sang three different groups of songs,
secular, spiritual, and popular. Most
of these were sung without accompan—
iment and all were illustrated by do
scriptions of the nesroes and of-their
methods of singing these songs. The
recital was well attended. Mrs. Tuck—
er also sang a number of songs for
the Quadrangle girls in the drawing
room after dinnen Wednesday.
