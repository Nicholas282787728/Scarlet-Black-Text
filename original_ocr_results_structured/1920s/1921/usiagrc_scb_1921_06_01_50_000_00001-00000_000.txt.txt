[IN GﬂNlEHENﬂE MEET

Missouri Valley Faculty Repre
sentalives Discuss Problems
.For Coming Year.

Prof. Paul F. Peck, returning [ruin
the meeting of the facility representa-
|tives of the Missouri Valley Confer-
leuce, at st. Louis, reports several
important measures passed upon by
that body. The regulations governing
intercollegiate baseball were made
more stringent to do away with rowA
dyism and unsportsmanllke conduct.
It was ruled that coaches must direct
their teams from the bench, and not
from the coaching boxes as has been
the custom.

 

Next year's cross country run will
be held at Nebraska on November 12.
,It was decided to'holrl an indoor track
meet'at Kansas City some time next
March. This is a new event for the
'conference and is looked forward to
enthusiastically in Missouri Valley
circles.

The board of faculty representatives
took steps to correct the abuse of the
conference rule against the use of the
‘lraining table. Since some of the
lscbools have been evading this regula
lion in one manner or another, a
training table was definitely defined
as any segregation of the athletic
lteams for their meals.

Freshmen Rules

The rules against giving Fresbmau
athletes sweaters, blankets and other
expensive awards was made more
s ringent. It was the sentiment of the
meeting that these awards should be
,rcserved for varsity teams IIcrcatter
conference teams cannot engage in
athletic competition with schools ’out—
ide the Missouri Valley which are
lnot up to the standard of the valley
schools. The request of Texas unis
,‘versity to play an annual football
[game with Oklahoma was refused on
‘tbc ground that the scholastic Stan»
card of the Lone star school is in—
adequate.

There was also a. discussion 01' pl'eA

every other team in the conference,.
once on it home floor and once on
its rivul‘s iluor. There is some un—
certainty as to the adoption or such
a plan, but it is very probable in as

representatives and coaches of
conference seem favorably inclined
toward it.

her classmates from the class of ’lﬁ.
The requirements for member, hip are
that one must be a student in Grur
hell and that one or the parents be a
graduate of the college. The original
purpose of the club was to promote
friendships among the daughters and
sons of graduates and to keep the
Griunell Spirit alive tbruout genera-
tions. It is of particular interest that
thc organi 'ttion be rev' ed at this

Closer Relations.

Plans for a closer cooperation hes
tween the mcrcnants of Ames and the
students of Iowa State college have
[long been under considcraticn, and
twcrc acted on dciinitely at a meeting
bctwceu the presidents of the frater—
nities and a committee of the Allies
Commercial club at a meeting held
last Thursday.

The Andes merchants have discov-
ercd that each year thonsandcof dole
lars worth of business has been lost
to them and they are seeking for the
cause. It was to [ind wherein the
merchants of Ames were lacking and
to secure the trade for them that this
.meeting was called. The Ames mer-
chants are doing everything in their
power to place their goods beicre the
students. and to carry lines of goods
that attract strident trade, according
,to the report, and next year expect to
reap much more business than for»
merly. It is expected that these meet-
ings will be continued thruout next
Iyear, and that they will prove of much
jbcneiit to merchants and students.

Professor Ganuaway paid tribute
to the soldiers of the ,Civil
War - rcscing the fact uiat these
men also fought that their , laud
might be a “land or the free" as well
as a “home of the brave". “What
these men did it is our duty to carry
on that our nation may be a true
democracy,” declared Professor Can-
naway in his closing remarks.

“What the true signiﬁcance of the
Great War is we cannot yet say” dc-
clared Professor ulyckoft in his open—
ing remarks. “Time alone will di
cover that. One thing, however, is
true: it was a war to end war. In
continuing his remarks Professor
Wyckoff reviewed seine of the InisA
erles brought upon the warring peo-
ples, the strain, the gvossness of the
camp life, the task of re»educaliou
the wounded and the misery in the
\vnr-slrléken countries. “To ward off
another war we must do away with
the causes. The psychological, bio—
logicalyand racial causes should be
remedied; the aggressiveness curbed;
education modernized, and economic
activities directed.”

The closing words of Professor
lVyckoff quoted from the Gettysburg
address express the impression left
by each of the speakers: “It is for us,
the living, rather to be dedicated here
to the unfinished work which they
who fought here have thus far so
uobly advanced. It is rather for us
to be dedicated to the great task re-
maining before us, that from these
honored dead we take increased de—
votion to that cause for which they
gavc the last full measure of devo-
tion,“ ‘

Following the services in the chapel,
students and faculty adjourned to the
College picnic which was staged under
the auspices of the Y. M. and the v.
u' c. A, in cooperation with Mrs. Ida
ulino. house director. The suddcn
showers of the afternoon rather broke
up the party and spoiled the program,
but the School of Music offered a con-
venient retreat and there was no ces-
sation of enjoyment.

Friday Is Last
Retaliation Day
For All Seniors

Friday will mark the last day at
work tor the graduating class and it
is with something of envy that the re—
mainder of the school regards the lib-
erties which will soon belong to the
seniors, wishing that they too might
be excused from the neces‘ty of
spending many a \\ ea: y hour in studi-
ous occupations ulleli time Elle so
many other things that offer their ate
tractions tor a brief space It is prob—
ablc, llowel'cl', that the so lots are
wondering l -1 what they are going
to do after graduation, and that they
are not looking forward to graduation
so much as they are looking backward
on their tour years in college ~1t will
not be too far fetched, possibly, to say
that while the scnim‘“nre glad to es-

sce thc end of a pleasant four years.
That, however, does not excuse the
rest of the school from a week of Im—
rest Somc people do seem lucky:

Women To Be Chosen For
High Honors.

Elections; to determine the winners
