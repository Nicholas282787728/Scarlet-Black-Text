NOLLEN ON PROGRAM

F it s t Celebration of Seventy-
ﬁfth Year of College
Founding. '

The Pilgrim movement in England,
in New England, and in Grinnell, fur»
lllshed the theme for the joint celebl‘as
tion of Washington's birthday, the
seventyﬁith anniversary of the found-
ing of the college, and the terceuten-
niai celebration of the coming of the
Pilgrims in the Mayflower, in the
special convocation in Her cl: chapel
yesterday morning. The beginning of

the spirit of Grinnell clear over in‘

England was traced through its varir

_ous stages of development by Prof.
w. H. Bridge, representing England,
Rev. . W. Cross, representing New
England, and Dean J. S, Nollen, repre»
senting Grinnell. Music by the Vesper
choi and by Professor Matlack at the
organ supplemented the speaking.

Prof. c. E. Payne, who presided
traced the growth of the unifying sp
ofrthc people of this country from the
landing of the Pilgrims, through the

' crises of the Civil war and the great
European war. He concluded by say—
ing that Grinnell was founded in the
spirit of' the Pilgrim fathers.

First Immigrants Religious.
‘Prnf. w. H. Bridge spoke on the
subject of "The Pilgrims in Old Engs
lilud.‘ “The religious overflow to this
count he saidprecedmg the eco—
nornic'overilow, furnished the deeper
strain of American civilization. This
country owes its spi it and’institiitions
fundamentally to the reading of the
Bible in Pilgrim times." Prof. Bridge
read extracts from accounts of the
first movements in Scrooby toward
emigration to the New “'0 d. In con-
cluding he said, “The spirit of the
Pilgrims is a symbol of man struggling
toward a city which hath foundations
and whose builder is God."

“The Pilgrims in New England" was
the topic of the address by Rev. E. w,
Cross, "The kindling oi the flame of
independence, the long sacriﬁce and
the critical work of the framing of the
constitution owes more to New Eng
land than to any other section of the
country. Nothing worthwhile is ever
w'on/by cold intellect or rigid con-
science, 0nly when the whole heart
and soul are on are is anything-won
for humanity," Through an account

of the establishment of free worship.

free government and free education as
instituted by the Pilgrim " Rev,
Cross showed the wide reaching influr
euce of the Pilgrim spirit.

Dean Nollen closed the series oi ad-
dl sses by a short mlk on "The
Pl grim Spirit in Grinnell.” “Grinnell
of today is the resulmht ot‘two con-
vergent streams of impulse, the ,Iowa
Band and J. is. Grinnell," and thus the
speaker began to relate the facts con.
cerning the founding or Grinnell Col-

more appreciated in view,o£ the this

the real stars, both in ntirue and in

Mr. Spargo severed relations with
the Socialist party in 1917, and ‘comes
to Crinnell. as an independent studenti

organization. For some months past,
Mr. Spargo has devoted himself to Anl

Maury Kent's snappy Amos ﬁve practi-
cally clinched the state championship
by defeating the Pioneers last night,

'25 to 16.

Contrary to custom, the Pioneers

ten minutes. A brace of baskets by

Allies had scored from the floor.
Midway in the half the Ames ﬁve
it their stride, however, and for the
remainder of the period it was a bat-

title royal, fast and well played. Ames

slowly over-came the Pioneer lead
through superior ability to drop the
ball through the hoop. Grinnell had,
many shots, but was unable to locate
the ring. As a result, the score was

llmotted, 11 to 11, when the half curled.

Amos Gels Loose.

Ames came back strongly when the
period opened, baskets by
Green. Shepard and Times putting
them well ahead, and from that time
on. they were never in serious danger,
Grinnell threatened to spurt several
times, but the visitors added steadily
to their score and ﬁnished with a cum—
fortable margin,

Although the‘ play waxed rough in
the second period, the ﬁrst half was
snappy and Wellsplayetl. Both teams
worked the ball down the floor in ex-
cellent fashion, the players handling
the sphere in ﬁnished style.

Fearing was the Pioneer scoring
star, with four ﬁeld counters to his
credit, and the guarding of Winter and
Macy was also effective,

“Pinkie" Green, sorrel-topped Amer

‘forward, was easily the star for the

visitors. He was the center of the
Ames offensive play at all times, and
counted three pretty baskets. Shep—
ard and Innes also ‘got a trio each,
Neither coach made a single substitu—
tion during the contest. ' _
