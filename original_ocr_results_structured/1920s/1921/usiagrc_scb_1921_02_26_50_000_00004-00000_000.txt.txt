The rivalry betwccn Jack and Mack

something approaching hatred. They
did their shopping with a fervor that
branded them the Best Dressers in

freedom, and the individualism that
leads to social solidarity, we shall

Mr. Spar-go compared quite at
length to conditions which existed in
1818, after the congress of Vienna,
and the conditions which existed in
1919 at the Paris Peace Conference,
and pointed out many points in which
the conditions of the two periods were
parallel.

“There can be no socialization of
society and its institutions irntil there
is a socialization of the consciousness
of the individuals in Society~until the
individual who advances a claim and
seeks to possess the advantages or
society is so thoroughly socialized in
his consciousness that he will want
to give his iull quota of service for
that received.

here were the chiefs things that Prof.

to say to a Scarlet and Black reporter
last night on the eve of his departure.
' “I am not in a position to compare

Gi-iiiucll with other schools of this part -

of the country, for Gi-inuell is the ﬁrst
institution at which I have stopped."
he said. “I do feel, however, that you
have here a wonderfully energetic and
determined type 01‘ scholarship."

“The college life seems very normal
and proper," he went on. “You have a
good time, yet You do not neglect your
work for it."

Professor Parker was enthusiastic
over the capabilities of the faculty.
outside as well as in the classroom.
“Your music is so good ~ everyone
seems to have an interest in music,“
be Said, “and I Was greatly surprised
to see your faculty turn and give a
play like they Presented ‘She Stoops
to Conquer.’ Professor Griffith's per--
forinance of Lumpkin was as ﬁne as

over they tell me they are amateurs.“

Professor Parker was likewise in—
terested in the tow-n of Grinnell. "It
is the best paved town I ever silty,“ he
sai ., "The quality of the streets is

your Iowa towns, but it is not so in
