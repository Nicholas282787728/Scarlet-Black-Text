With but a few steps to go, the

committee, who have no more time
for this work than anyone else on the
campus, and who are giving their
time, in addition to their pledges, so
as to get the drive across.

It is hard to think how some few
can stand on the sidelines and let

‘all are deriving equal beneﬁt. in
years to come, when students how on

end of the yuar when men choose their,

rooms for the succeeding year. A sysL

permit all the men who wish to remain
in their present building or rooms to

choose ﬁFst, so that the traditions

which they have built up around their

rooms should be left in each building

responsible for keeping up the tradie

come into consideration if this move is

both important. It is believed, hoWr

other colleges are giving the sports
