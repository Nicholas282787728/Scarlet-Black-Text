The total now in the endowment
coffers is a little over $36,000, which
the committee declares is good, but
not good enough, according to mem-
bers who checked the pledges last
night They point out that students
are not coming across as fast as is
desired, and in as large amounts as
is desired. They feel that when Knox
and Carleton, and other smaller in
stitutions can raise over $50,000 that
Grinnell should have little difficulty
in coming to that mark.

Canvass Quadrangle

A complete canvass of t‘be_auadi-an-
gle was ,made Wednesday, resulting
in bringing in a large number of dc-
linquents into line. Women are es-
pecially anxious to have the Quad-
rangle 100% perfect in order to re-
ceivc the additional $1,000 offered as
a reward by a friend of the college.

Only about 475 students have so far
pledged, according to the count and5
there is no reason why the number‘
should not come to more than 700
pledges, according to committee memu
bcrs. The collection and canvassing,
has been in charge of the individualj
class committees, and although work:
has been slow, especially in the casel

Eugene whinery, Mrs. J. L. Fellows,
Mrs. G, P. Wyckoft, and others who‘
will be appointed later. The general
plan is to combine all existing organi-
zations into one great body of women.
The president of each of the Women's
organizations of the city is a member
of the'general committee, which willl
number more than thirty women.
Women Suggest Action

The luncheon Thursday was the re-
sult of action on the initiation of lo-
cal club women. - The Drummond
club, with an initial gift of 3100 out—
rigbt started the ball rolling, and
from this gilt the spirit spread‘
through the many clubs, who offered
to pledge various amounts, relative‘
to the membership of the clubs. A'
pledge of $3,000 was announced from
the local Women's Club, the P. E. 0.'s
and the Entre Nous club have pledged
$1,000 apiece, and the lllagoun club
has pledged $500. Mrs. Eugene Hener
ly, one of the speakers said, “The
Drummond club has started the ball
rolling, and the big snowball will be
rolled around that gift until it grows
tic-great proportions."

Speakers at the meeting, which was
in charge of Mrs. A. c. Lyon. were
President Main, H. s. McCowan, Mrs.
Eugene Henely, and Mrs. Frederick
Weita, president of the Des Moines
Women‘s club, who represented the
members of the crinncll Women’s

part of the Pioneers, enabled the vis»
itors to run up 12 points before the
locals had broken into the scoring col-

and Pioneer passes often went wild

period ended the Huskers had run
the count up to 20, while Sherman’s

The work of Smith, Bekins and
Bailey of Nebraska was exceptional.
Smith, a rather frail youth of medium
height, counted a total of six field
goals. His shots from the field were
unusually accurate, and he also
counted a pair'on clever tip-shots,
taking the ball from the bankboai‘d.

That the Fellowship conference
just closed was the most successful,
both from point of attendance and
program, was the concensus of opin-
ion expressed yesterday after the
closing meeting of the conference, by
ministers in attendance. More than
seventy-five Iowa ministers were in
attendance, and many of them were
accompanied by their wives. Dele-
gates wcrc entertained in Grinnell
private homes. Many tool: meals at
the Dormitories and Quadrangle.

The central feature of the confer»
ences is the Gates Memorial lecture
series, given this year by President
H. c. King, of Oberlin. other speak-,
ers were Dr. E. A. Steiner, Grinnell‘

Speakers informed the women of
the general condition of the college

outlining the uses to which the funds
would be used. It was pointed out
that it was not a matter or needing

need is to save the college, then ex—

plained. That the first million and

That Grinnell was worthy of the
gift was pointed out from the fact
that the General Education Board
had given its support more liberally
than to some other colleges. The
story of the secretary at one at the
leading educational so‘Eieties in the
country. who placed Gx'innell at the
head of the list of ideal coeducational

ed. This secretary. who tabulated in-
