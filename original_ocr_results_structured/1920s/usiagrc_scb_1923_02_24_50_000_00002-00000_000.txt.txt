The semester grade lists show that

the Freshman men rank exceedingly
low in grades, as indicated by their
average of only 19 points. This means
that the prep men have less than a
straight C average. Various reasons
may he cited-far this deﬁciency of the
freshmen, but none of them seem sat-
isfactory. Some say that there has
been a general tightening down in the
matter of grading this year; others
say that the freshmen have not had

W SIHXGTON’S WISDO L

If George Washington only knew
how badly woh'ld-be
statesmen are inaligning his reputation
and distorting his utterances or \vis-
dom nowadays he would turn over in
his grave. Washington, in his farce
well address to the American congress,
advised against any entangllng alli-
ances with European nations. This
admonition of his has been twisted
around to mean that we should pur-‘
sue a policy nf utter isolation from
Europe and sit by while her economic
foundations crumble utterly and civili-
zation over theln ceases.

Washington's statements should be
interpreted in the 'light of historical
events. The wisdom oi one centuiy
becomes the prattle or a later age.
Nothing is sure except change, but a
dead man never has a. chance to
change his own opinions. It is there-
