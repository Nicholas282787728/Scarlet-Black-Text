Here is an mportant announcement.
An announcement that should intrigue
the interest and stir the anticipation to
‘ no less a degree than the inspiri ing
football news which this issue of 'the
Scarlet and Black conmins. Satur—
day brings the first football game of
the Season, and Fridays brings—the
.Klrst number of the College Lecture
course. '

The mention of the football season

‘ quickens the imagination and causes
the blood to race. It gives us a
mental picture 0! a fresh, green field,
washed with brilliant afternoon sun»
light, ﬂecked with darting colors.
scarlet and black predominating.’ we
see with the eye of the mind the
struggle of flesh with ﬂesh, muscle
with muscle, and are stirred by the
thought of a hundred heroisms which
the incomparable days will produce.
.The more we think of it the stronger
‘uticipution grows and. as much as
' the actual gladiators, we are swept by
. ‘a Beowulflen eagerness for the fray,
‘ After such exulting at the thought
or college football prospects ls it
anti—clruax to speak of college ‘leo-
"lure prospcc w 'WC say no, There
racy be those who are incapable of
~,intellectual exultation 'out they are
not college folk. one of the blessed
things college gives to its sons and
daughters is’ an ever—enlarging in—
tellectual appetite and an ever-ex-
'nending capacity to exult in the an—
' hicipation’ and enjoyment of an intel—
lectual feast
' Therefore, Grinnellians, rejoice, for
jthe mole is spread for the banquet,
and on Friday next, Octubcr third, We
shall 'sit ,down to eat,

The dispenser of the first course
'will bs.M»r. o. H. Blnre, and he will
serve us a rare dish which he calls
"Canterbury." Did you feel the
thrill? 01 course you did. Canter—

It re-‘kindles for us the tires on the
hearth of the Tabard at Southwarir.
The Pilgrims spring-to life in our
animated iancy and we recall the ﬂea

this sparkling past Mr. Elore will lead
us, illustrating his lecture with heau-
ﬁml stereopticon pictures. We will
follow him to that ancient Kentish
city which Augustine made a door for
Christ's entry into ,hriiain. We
shall stand within the hallowed wells
of Saint Martin's the oldest Christian
church in England. and which has
echoed to the swell a! Christian songs
for fourteen hundred years. And
then, we shall pass tn the matchlcss
cathedral, rich in historic memory.
where Edward the Black Prince lies
buried, where Becket died a martyrs
death, Where the middle ages still
reach out to touch the living present.
Hear, then, the call from Southwark:

Just two words more. the first
about Friday’s lecturer and the second
about the lecture course.

Mr. G. H. Blore is Head Master of
England's great public School 0! win-
Chester; 3, man-0f ripe scholarship. a
specialist in history, and eminently
qualified to deal with so alluring a
~theme as "Canterbury." He has
come to the United states on a lecture
tour and, incidentally, to acquire at—
mosphere for the sympathetic teach-
ing of American History in his on
great school.

In regard to this lecture, and to
the lecture course as a whole, orin—
nell College is conﬁdently relying ups
on a hearty and loyal support of its

citizens of Grinnell. The committee
in charge holds the faith that the col—

ences to and from and in Europe,
given at the Congregational church
last Sunday evening.

"Of course ‘financial considerations

joined professor and deans and stu-
dents from eastern universities, those
classes noted for their huge salaries.
and expensive living, and went to
Europe via the cattle boat method,"
said professor Bradshaw. “To begin
with, we were all respectable enough:
but when we got out to sea We were
about as tough a bunch of roughnecks
as 1 ever hope to see. When We pulls
ed out at tlil‘eerthirty every morning
to feed our cattle, we were just about
as nnpromising a looking crew as
ever was, and in anyone had seeu us,
or if we could have seen ourselves,
we'd not have had much love or re-
spect ol' sympathy for us."

During the trip through Europe, he

PITEPS IBIISK VARSITY
IN STIESTIIMMASE

Prep Sqnm] Shows Up Well in Varsity
Scrap, {Though Handicapped
by hack of weight.

Contrary to expectations, the lresh~
imen squad was thrown against the
varsity Tuesday night for a short
,ssrimiuage that enabled the coaches
to get a better line on both teams.
The preps, although exceedingly light,
.and not in good condition, held the
,varsity better than was expected, sev-
,el' 1 times throwing themi for a loss.

Couches MacEacllron and Bradshaw
used nearly twenty men against the
varsity, while i—lylhnd and Black used
only, eleven. The lack of weight on
the prep‘ line handicapped them great—
,ly, and as a rule the Pioneers had no
,trouhle in making their line smashes
'good, although Spencer, a husky lad
from Montana. smeared several plays
in fine style. The ends, too, were
weak on the freshman team, but the
secondary defense of Schncncman,
Fri/aha, Wolfe, and Locke was especi-
ally good at stopping the varsity-s at—
tempts with an aerial attack, That
branch of the game showed'that Hy-
land and Biaclr will in all probability
put in a good deal of time perfecting
the passing combinations in the few
remaining practice sessions before the
Cornell game.

For the varsity, Taylor showed his
speed and open field ability in wide
end rims, and also in snagging long
passes. Captain Critchett also made
some brilliant runs at times from his
Dositimi at left half, while Sweet at
the other halfback position Showed
that he is still as flashy as ever in
either bucking the line or skirting the
ends.

The Lille-lip

The first team lineup consisted of
Taylor and Melanin at ends, Wood and
Duke at taclilcs, Coilirart and Martin
at guards, Mayer, center, Johnson,
quarterback, Wing fullback. and Crib
chctt and Sweet at halvcs, although
tins lineup may be decidedly changed

The Cornell aggregation promises to
be pariicuarly strong this year, with
"Poly” Wallace. former All-American
center, Coaching a large squad of vet-
erans. Captain Hartwell, who has
ﬁgured largely in Cornell’s past two
wins over Gllnnell, is a fast heady
backdcld man and will probably be
seen at quarter this year. Hooper is
a. strong fullback who is expected to
take the place of the star Kil'win, lost
by graduation, While Dean, another
veteran, will hold down one of the
halves, with either Lamp or Cray as
his running mate. Kash, a star on
inst year's team, is expected to huld
down one wing position, with either
Laue or Adamson, both new men, at
the other. The line is causing the
Coaching staff the most difficulty, al-
though they will have experienced
guards ln'Reec‘k and nines, Hummell,
Bohlander, and Truckenmiller, an
Olympic wrestler, have been doing the
best at tackles, with Burgardt slated
for the center position.

As this is the iirst game of the sea,—

probably use substitutes freely in each
lineup, and especially if the game is
