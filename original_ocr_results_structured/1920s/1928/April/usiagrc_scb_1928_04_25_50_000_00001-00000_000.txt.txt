Beta Kappa since its birth at William
and Mary college in Virginia in 1776.
Professor Grass pointed out that this
was the twentieth anniversary of the
chapter at Grinncll. a charter having
been granted in 1008. He then passed
to this theme, which was; ”Learning
is the guide of life,” the meaning of
the letters Phi Beta Kappa.

“Countless great men in the past,”
said the speaker, “have stressed the
necessity of learning. such as Socrates.
Solomon, Jesus. What did these three
say about learning? 'ICnow thyself,'
urged the Greek philosopher. while
‘Get wisdom, and with thy getting, get
understanding,’ was the eually strong
advice of the old king of Israel. Jesus
Himself said, 'Seek and ye shall find:
knock and ii. shall be opened unto
,iou.’ Education is learning the rules
of the game of life, learning to know
men and their ways and fashioning
ourselves to move in harmony with
the great natural laws which govern
the universe."
