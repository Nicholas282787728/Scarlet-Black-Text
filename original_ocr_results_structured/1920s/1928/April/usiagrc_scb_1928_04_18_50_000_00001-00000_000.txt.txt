Arid Drake Relays Are Sched-

A dual with (Joe college Saturday
afternoon at Cedar Rapids in which
a full squad will represent Grinnell,
the holne meet Tllesday afternoon
and the Drake relays a week from
Friday and Saturday mark the first
days of the outdoor track season as
the busiest seven of the year, so for
as the local tracksters are concerned.
and as one of the busiest which any
Pioneer cinder team has faced.

The dual with Coe ‘was scheduled
early this week following the decision
of Coach Duke to pass up the Kansas
relays in favor of a meet in which he
could 'sce all of his men in action. For
his opponents. he has picked one at
the strongest teams close at hand. The
Cedar Rapids squad includes a, weight
mall who throws the discus 148, four
men “ho can run a half mile in the
neighborhood of tire minutes, a jav-
Dlin thrower Whose tosses are com—
17dI'Ilhle to Laird's, two or three strong
men in the distance events and a fleet
dash man or two.

The indications are that Coc will
be strong where Grinnell is wealr and
that Gl'innell will be strong Where
(Ice is weal" The Kohawks should
score hem v in the half and mile.
events in which they have some ' o[
the strongest men of tile conference
While the Pioneers should take points
in the quarter and hurdle races.

It would be hard to pick a faster
combination thah McKee, Mark and
Kirlgery to run the 440. McKee, Who
has registered under so seconds sev-
eral times, is fast rounding into shape
and may, if the day is good, approach
his record Saturday. Mark and King
ery should both step the event close
to 52 seconds. The hurdle events also
find Grinnell particularly strong with
both Taylor and captain Long topping
the sticks in fast time.

"Feeling that our men have not
had enough good Weather to get into
shape for the Kansas relays and that
more men will receive the benefit of
early competition by the dual meet
with Coe, we decided not to go south.
However we are taking a large squad
to Drake," Coach Duke stated yester-
day. i

It is probable that half, mile and
quarter-mile relay teams Will run at
Drake in addition to Taylor. Green
and McCully who will run the high
hurdles, pole Vault and high jump
respectively, Duke indicated.

This Week begins a season in which
the squad will he in action every week

Brass-Choir Displays Unusual'l'one
In Interpreting Every
Tum Passage,

By 111-. i. Herbert Knight.

All 'those people who attended the
concert given hy the Minneapolis
Symphony orcbestri). in the Herrick
Chapel on Monday afternoon last
must have considered themselves for-
tunate indeed, ‘The program provided
for their delectation was so nicely fli-
vel'slfied, balanced and proportioned,
and the playing otthe musicians car~
ricd such distinction, that the extent,
as a Whole, must have given genuine
satisiaction and unqualiﬁed delight to
evcry one present.

The printed program included
Beethoven’s Overture to "Egmont,"
Dvorak's "Now World” symphony, the
Prelude to Moussorgsky’s- ”Knoll/ant-
chim,” George Schumann’s brilliant
and virtuose Dance of the Nymphs
and Satyrs from "Anior et Psyche,”
Beethoven's Theme and variations
from the Quartet in A major, and the

Introduction to Act III of Wagner’s -

“Lohengriu,” and the encore pieces so
generously conceded included a Bee-
thnvcn "Rondino" and Rimslry-Kol-sa—
koff's "Flight of the Bumble-Bee."
The listed compositions, together with
the several encore pieces, blended
Well enough together to form an ex-
tremely interesting and exhilarahi
program.

Not At M rimllln Strength

While the orchestra was not, on this
occasion, at maximum concert
strength, it cannot be said that the
playing of the men lacked anything in
the nature of power or brilliance. The
brass-choir, in particular, displayed a
warmth and splendor of tone that
gavc,cvcry tuiti passage a sharp and
telling significance. and the string~
choir, though rather small in num-

bers, was sufficiently large to lde~ '

qllately “till" the Herrick Chapel. In-
deed it can be said that the very
smallness of the auditorium added to
the effectiveness of the playing, for
not a single feature in the passages
of subtle delicacy escaped the audi-
ence, and the close proximity of the
musicians to the listeners established
a certain bond of intimacy which all
orchestral conductors hope for but
seldom experience,

Syllmllollics Amuse Interest

As was the case with the program
presented last year by the Minneapo—
lis Symphony orchestra, the sympho-
ny aroused the greatest interest and
provoked the most spontaneous apr
plause. Last season the playing of the
Tsclmikowsky E minor Symphony cre-
ated something of a sensation, and
