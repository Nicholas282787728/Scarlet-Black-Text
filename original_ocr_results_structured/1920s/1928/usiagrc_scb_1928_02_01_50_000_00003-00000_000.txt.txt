The Column o1 Pttrd Hem-W.

We can't imagine what the matter
can be. but we've won two basketball
games in succession. Perhaps we'd
better put a stop to this before we're
engulfed in n tlood or publicity and
icrceu to build a. field house or some
other tragedy overtakes us.

Truly the life 01 a roonrmrate is
filled with tribulations, imagine tr)"
ing to get Boh Alt oil to an eight
o’clock; picture your-sell sharing your
bed with Brewster Woodhurn while a
guest occupies his; think of having
to listen to Creighton Peter-son. Gib-
-son Harris or Ford Stewart talk in
their sleep. Think of the ones who
have to listen to Mclntire and Brown
in their first rehearsal or a song or
to Evnhn brushing up on “The Shoot-
ing of Dan nrcGrew." Even the Ames
game might become tiresome after
Ted Lovejoy had played it over thirty
or forty times. But these little matters
would be as nothing to the boy who
lives with “Clancy" Helln alter the

That's the spirit. boys: All right
now let's hear- from some more or
you birds that got it in the neck] (nut
literally) on this ladies’ choice deal...

We can't imagine the meaning oi
all these wild rumors about Charlotte
Cathcart and the heavy jewelry. We
heard. however, that the whole thing
was just a flash in the pan. Maybe a
trial engagement patterned after-
these trial marriages we‘ve been reads
ing about.

Whatever other purpose this forthr
coming sigma Delta Chi show may
have. we hope it affords a basis for
settlement of an argument in Kelly
stables regarding the best looking
knees in school.

Now that the semi-annual skirmish
with L. v. Pelps is with most of us a
ﬁlling of the past. we can now all set-
tle down to our plan of farsighted
study and living. Don't tell us col-
lege students aren't far-sighted.
Most all of them can plan irom one
week-end to the next and some even
from one vacation to the next. Just
look at some of the scholarly vaca»
tions they arrange.
