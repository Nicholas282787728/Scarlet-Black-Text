“The United States must stop the

abroad by gunfii , establish some type
of intersAniericdn court for settling
disputes, and substitute for our mar-

“Even i you think the United States
is doing a better job oi collecting cuss

“that the Nicaraguans and their neiglis

GRINNELL. IOWA,

iii ltobcrt liurliugmnc.

Siowl and cautiously, but with dis-
arming triendlmess, John Nevin Sayre
answered our newspaper-csc questions,
as the two of us sat chatting together
in thc empty auditorium of Herrick
chapel, icilowing his talk on NiCs
aragua, Tuesday evening.

“Yes, l ﬁnd a surprising interest in
the subject among college students,
Zili'_ Sayre assured us, replying to the
ouci , “Are the coleges thinking saris
ously about conditions in Nicaragua?"

"l hare visited schools in Nebraska,
Missouri. Minnesota, and iowa," be
continued, "and everywhere the ques~
tion is being debated, with the result
that it has received a great deal of
attention,"

Then followed another question,
typical of present-day Grinnell: “In
your travels, ilr. Sayre, do you en.
counter that malady, called ‘student
apathy', which is said to be so gens
oral?"

The witness didm.‘ hesitate for an
answer “in every student generas
tion the majority are concerned only
with girls and athletics. but every-
where you ﬁnd signiﬁcant minorities
alive to inter-national and other prob-
lems. Certainly those groups are lar-
ger today than during my undergradu.
ate years. Two years ago $50,000
was spent to generate interest in the
World Court among college students:

Nicaragua, Sayre Tells Interviewer

possibly there has subsequently been
a slight recession from that high level,
which was at most, artificial."

Our next attempt misnred. Did Mr,
Sayre ﬁnd a higher level of intelli-
gence among eastern or western coir
lege students” His stock rose decid-
edly in this interviewer's estimation
when he gracefully sidestepped the
loaded pistol by saying, "i really have
no means of forming an opinion on
that point."

He did, however, pay a high tribute
to middlesweslei‘n education by says
ing that he hoped his children would
come west to college. “I believe in
co-educntion", the speaker stated,
while this writer murmured aloud at
such heresy coming from an easterner.
"Furthermore I prefer a college about
the size of Grinneli, where most or all
of the students must work for the ad—
vantages whic htiiey receive. I do not
approve of the super-luxury prevailing
at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton."

A glance at the clock and a conﬁrm-
atory nod from the waiting Y. M, C. A
representative warned us that ,\lr.
Sayre must be off to make his railroad
connections to Cornell college, the
next stop. He ended the interv
with the remark that his lecture trips
were a pleasant vacation, freeing him
from the slavery of telephone calls
and unanswered correspondence

in attempting to pick an aiisdorm

Nearly all oi the teams had good in-

with their weaker men, For this rea»

year were shifted to outfield because
of their value to the team.

Dibble had a fast infield, nearly
every member of which is placed on
the allsdurm team. All of the other
teams had outstanding players and it
is the attempt of the writer to include
as many of these men as is possible.
