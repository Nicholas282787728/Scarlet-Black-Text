.\X ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT.

The action of the administrztion committee of the
faculty yesterday taken at tire time of an election by the
men on amendments to the Constitution had a dampening
effect on the whole affair. The men realized that any
vote on their part would not have an immediate effect
on the outcome, and consequently, after chapel, the vote
fell off. This at least was their interpretation, though
not exactly a fact. Psychologically, this action was bad,
although undoubtedly it will result in some concrete
action for improvement in campus government.

The call is [or a revision of student government to
provide a greater co-uperatron between the student and
faculty group. Then the ﬁrst thing to do is to present
the proposi on to thc nrcn as to whether they wrsh ii
government by the faculty, out and out, or some form of
student government.

There is no cause for alarm in the present situation.
The Court and the Senate are merely non-operative for
the time being and the government of the college is in
the hands of the President. The thing to do from now on

‘ only through preparation.

method for better student government.

Tire suggestion has been made that the students elect
a committee of ﬁve from the faculty and the faculty elect
a similar committee of ﬁve from the student body to get
together for some tangible means of reform. Then the
students could elect three of the students from those the
faculty chooses, and two others of their own choosing;
the faculty could elect three of those the students selected
and two others of their own choosing. This would make
a workable committee of ten members which would be
amenable to both students and faculty

Until such Action, or any similar action, is taken. the
students should seriously consider the fornr of govern»
lirent which will best bring out a mode of control devised
for the best interests of Grinuell/cullege as a whole.

“Peace at any price," wt , during the war, the cry of

the supposed patr t, the savcalieil one hundred per cent

who was swept off his feet into the emotional crir

the world, with no aim and no consideration of the facts,
but lust where to go where the current took him. There
were not a few such minds. It w. s surprising how many
American citizens possessed an introiectivc mind, and
how quickly a vast delusion was built up which only re
cent investigation has proved bow false that delusion
was. Anti the same thing could happen again on the
least provocation, while the world is still stilling to rer
cm‘er from the effects of the last war,

The present (try is a steadily increasing demand [or

is to prepare for it, All things worth whilc are attained
What is to be the most atlas
nuate method of preparation for peace is yet undiscou
cred. Total disarmament is doubtful unless rill the great
nations agree to this policy. The World Court is a step
toward a uorld peace. International orgaiii itions such
a s the Red Cross. Rotariahs, and others are helping to
bring about a sympathetic understanding among nations
As soon as the nations under and each other, and can
have coniidence in one another, a unixersal peace cdn be
hoped for.

Reccut experience, as well as present invcsigaiion has
shown that one of the greatest causes or war is propa-
ganda, the building up of a strong emotional current which
ruthlessly swecps before it the introlectirc minds. if
there were fener iritrojccts and more real patriots in the
country a world peace would not be so iiiev able. Per»
[raps if it were possible to throw up as intensive an
emotional wave in the favor of the peace, as there is
built up during war, the introjccts might be caught in
this current of peace, but such a method is not the most
ndequdte. True patriotism, not that of the iiiti-ojcct
which is only a false one, but a patriotism based on the
desire for justice and the principle of brotherhood is
ucccssail. A true patriot wants what i best for his
coililLL and place brings greater prosperity than war.
War is not tile only method, nor it the best uay of
settling an international dispute A sinccrc presentation
of all the facts, and a sympathetic understanding among
nations not backed by a bullying war department, could
be more effective and less expensive than war.

portrayed campus activities in the
most interesting and unusual way
were given preference
