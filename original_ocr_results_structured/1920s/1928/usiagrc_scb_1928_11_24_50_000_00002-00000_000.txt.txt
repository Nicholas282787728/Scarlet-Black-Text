FOOTBALL HISTORY

Tire 1923 iootball season at Grinnell has become

history. The game with Cr 'glltonﬁntls, a successiul

s season tor the Pioneers, a season that we can point to
\ th pride as indicative or the slogan, "Grillnell Fights."
The team has demonstrated this repeatedly throughout
the season, coming ircm behind and winning under the
greatest handicaps. All honor to those men who so lo
ally carried the scarlet and black to such glorionsnlcr
tor-ies.

The past season seems conclusive evidence that
Grinnell is much better ott in her present conference.
Tire schedule has been highly sntisiactory the team has
played excellent

Grirmell college lras been host to the ninth annrral
comelltinil ot' the Iowa H gll School Pres. association
concluding its [\l'ostlny scs ion here too There lune
hcerr certain worthwhile icatrrrcs oi this convention tirat
merrt comment.

The SCARLET AND BLACK compl'merrts members
or Sigma Delta Chi and Theta Sigma Phi in sponsoring
srrcir a successful corrrcnrion. In his address to the
tlrlcgtites Fi'itli ercnine, Warren Itoss, president. oi the
tasso atiou tor 1023, said, ”If you crer want In irold a
contention wliore hospitali rs supremo, where pro-
grains are arranged without 21 hi , and where a great
deal may be learned. you can get. such a proerarn at
Griuncii coilei, , the home oi the scarlet and black "

In this compliment to the college we see a great
deal to hc pleased with.
are eucsts oi the students ior two days. They have an
opportunity at sociuc the college in action so to speah.
They come in contact with urea prominent in the iield
or journalism over the state, They bring their problems
to experts uho try to soire them. In tact the convene
tiou is an annual clearing house ior journalistic diliir
erriti , that can he solr ed by discussion arid intelligent
adr ice on the part or mature newspaper then

The delegates are letuillg tlri ercnrng liiglily pleas—
ed with the entertainment and satisiied as to the worth
oi [lie convention. In this we see an encouraging irr-
turc. Those tielt‘gnles hare become acquamtcd with
Grillnell's socral trio and with the opportunities otter-ed
here. Most important, howerer, is the ncnuairrtancship
urth inc journalistic opportunitrcs that Grimlcll otters.
After all. these men and women are primnr
ed m journalism at a pirate -'on. Tircy hare been told
oi liie department. at .ournaiism in which they can taho
i'alilzillle courses This is certruuly something that Grin»
hell can error with pride.

However, these delegates can also be shown the
splendid examples oi iurli 'dual jnitiatrre in creative
journalrstic work in publications at Grinnell. It is one
thing to he taught the theory at news it rtrng, It is
another to participate in independent enter-prises that
prrt this theory to the acid test. That is what Grinnell
cdn otter to these embryo editors and manage s. A press

convention serres as an opportunity of presenting these *

tbmgs to high school students.

We hid farewell to these delegates ior onevmore
year. We hope that the contact with Grinnell has con—
tributed as much to them as their presence on‘ the cam-
pus has contributed to Gr-innell in her creative eiiort's
