As the ﬁrst third of the intramural
basketball series is tinished. the
race for the court championship has
become a threecornererl battle with
Dibble in the lead.

wttb clean sweeps over Langan
and Smith. Six has still to lose a
game. in spite’of her straight vic-
tories. she was taxed to the llmlt'to
win three of the four games.

Four. by two last minute rallies tor
wins over Clark hall fives. one victory
and one decisive defeat by the Smith
“B" squad, is tied with Kelly stahles
for second place. The Stable ﬁves
suffered their only deteat at the hands
or the Langan “B" quintet.

Louder: Have Not Met.

Since the three leading squads have
not yet met. any weighing or their relr
ative strengths must be guesswork.
Dibble has a formidable "A" team
headed by two elusive tor-wards who,
thus tar. are well up in the series
high-score list. Gray and DeLong
have been big reasons why- their team
has scored heavily in both its games.
Locke, playing running guard. has
:born the brunt of the Dibble detense.

The Courthouse "B" team. while not
so imposing as the ”A" team. boasts
two good guards and one or two men
who can hit the hasket. llaytum and
Brooke are perhaps the best "B"
team guards who have played thus
far. Maytnm and Taylor. center for
the A" squad. will both be lost to
the Dibbiites soon because ot varsity
track. ~

The Forensic "A” team is one of the
best balanced which has entered the
campaign so tor. it is composed oi A

baskets. Captained by Claude Richey.
the only man who has consistently
sunk baskets lrorn the middle of the
tloor. and led in scoring by Scott.

utes to rescue the game trom Five, the
Four team has shown power which
may conquer both Dibble and Three -
when it meets them. The "B” team.
after dropping a game to Smith. or
sented a much stronger attach to win
trom Clark in a thrilling game. The
team has no star but dcncnt on close
