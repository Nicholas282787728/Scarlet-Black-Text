“The psychologists may put us in

expressing her belief that p. chology
and religion are no more in conflict
than religion and natural lav

“\l‘licn iii the nineteenth century
science coniinccd the common man
that the world is governed by law, a
chill fell upon him," Miss Royden
said. “The world seemed just 3 mm

ble.

“But whereas it seems perfectly
logical to say that, since the universe
is governed by unchangeahle law, we
are helpless. the course or events has
proved the opposite. Because the
world is governed by law, we can
govern it. The truth has set us free.
Today, instead of adapting ourselves
to the world, we adapt the world to
ourselves.

The chill of fear and impotence that
men felt in the face of science is now
gone. but modern psychology has
brought another chill to the world.
Miss Royden stated.

"It is all right to consider stars a
point of universal law," she said, "but
not the spirit. Modern psychology
brings tear and doubt when its states
that what you do today is the sum of
all that happened to you and your
parents in the irrevocable past.

Since the intramural basketball
race is over, it is customary to pick
an allrstar team composed oi represen-

ing this the sport writer draws upon
his own head the wrath of nearly eve
eryone and the commendation of al-
most none. However, in the mind of
the writer the team selected is com-
posd oi the best men in the league.

provide responsibility for the up-

institution to produce children for the
perpetuation oi the race and to pro-
