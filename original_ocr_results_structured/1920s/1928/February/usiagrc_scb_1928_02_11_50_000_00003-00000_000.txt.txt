Must Somehow Be Bad, Says
Fellowship Lecturer.

"A church without sacraments is on
he same level as the Salvation Arr

ed the Rev. Charles A. Hawley or 107
--a city in his address hctore the Fel-
owship conierenc last Thursduy at-
ernoou in A. R H. adultorium. Mr.

llwley endeavored to point out the
elation hetween religion and edllca~‘

ices or young people in the churches,.

Restraint [‘nuse of Trouble.

In the state University or lowa, at,
which the Reverend Mr. Hnn'ley is
teaching, there is a total at about
6442 students of which trom 500 to
600 are Roman catholics, 95 to 105.
Jewish, and the rest either Protestant
or or no religion at all. or the great
uninher at students who come to the
university each year many are sentl
home in disgrace because ot drunkeur
ess on the campus, cheating in exam-
inations, passing had checks and im—
morality. As the cause or this the
speaker gave the tact that most Iresh-i
men come directly trom homes which
have exercised a certain amount of
restrain . they glory in their .new-
iound freedom. thus creating proh-,
lems for the deans. The dutonloliilei
has created many problems because
oi the opportunity it otters the SN»
dent to visit questionable places.

"When the ideal hoy returns from
college disgraced, the parents lay the
blame on the institution," said Mr.
Han-icy. “They expect the authorities
to do what they, themselves, would.
not do. ‘

Religion Taught Nogutly'el'

“General opinion has it that religion
is not taught in the universities," Mn;
Hawley remarked, f‘hut it is,—\vith a‘

 

 

negative point or View” Every course some way counteracted." This was
in the social sciences has much to the essence at the third lecture by the
say at religion, especially oi its pl'lml‘ Reverend C. W. Gilkey in Herrick

tive origin. and the idea reigns that
everything primitive must somehow
be but." Psychology is now in its
plastic age, according to the speaker,
and in this science education is car»
ried on quite independent of God or
religion; organized Christianity is any
tirely hroken down.

“The protestant church lyy means
or denominational colleges and boards
cl education has tried to uphold the
point at view of religion, but students
tind they have no ideas which they
can relate to modern psychology and
science. There is much diliiculty
among students in adjusting their-
own ideas of religion to modern
thought.

Students Ignorant m' Biltle.

"After all,” said Mr. Hawley, "the
protestant church is founded on the
Bible, but it is surprising, the stu-
dents that come to college with no ad-
equate knowledge oi the Bible. The
vast majority do not read the Bible,

old family devotions, or say grace at
the table."

IJeers Come Before

Fame, Says Gilkey

(Continued from Page 1).

Dr. Gilkey pointed out that it is
during such periods as our present
time, when things are changing and
all social landmarks and conventions

‘are breaking that humanity makes its

rapid progress toward some detinite
goal.
War Stretched Human
Capacities

“Since the World war when human
capacities were stretched to the
breaking point, when endurance, sym-
pathy, and iaith were overestrztined,
the spiritual pendulum has swung to
the other extreme characterized by a
youth's weary shrug oi the shoulders
signifying. 'What’s the use?’ This
moral fatigue poisoning characteristic
of the present generation should be in

“If we all could have
lllbernated a your or two af—
[or the war we might have returned
to normalcy sooner. As such an ac»
currence was impossible the strenu-
ous activity continued and we could
not sleep, work or rest adequately.
Onl' nerves were jumpy, and we were
in constant tear or the world coming
to an end. We acquired a severe case
or mental cramps."
“Whether or not the contemporary
moral and spiritual symptoms that
most attlict and depress our contemr
norary time and generation are a di -
cct result at moral overrslrnin is a
question tor retlection," lur. Glllrey
continued. “Every one knows that in
times ot over-strain one looks desperr
ately tor the ‘kick' or now thrills.
which seeks an outlet in sex and ll-
quor. This is outstanding evidence
that our consciences have been
plugged with paralysis ot sin and dis-
illusionment. The modern age is
characterized not hy skepticism hut
by cynicism.
“Religion is not just a pounding so-
cial imperative but is more than that
in that it is ‘good news' in a profound
sense, and it it loses this quality it
will lose something that is essential
and vital," Mr, Gilkey continued.
“‘Vhelllel‘ we like it 01" not WC are
going to be driven hack to meet the
problems oi the inner lite. The re-
discovery ot wealth, beauty, dignity,
and glory or the inner lite in the pre-
sence ot high standards is a. coming
thing."

"The very aim of lite and essence or
religion is activity," Mr. Gilkey cons
eluded.
