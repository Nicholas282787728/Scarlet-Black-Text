West Transforms World endl‘rost
Transcend: It, States Gates
Lecturer Yesterday.

SPEECH CDNCLUDES CONFAB

”Today the Soul Is Personality”;
Has Changed Through Ages,
Chicago Man Avers,

“Only those can transform the
world whose vision has already trans-
celided it." Dr. Charles W. Gillley,
Gates Memorial lecturer for 1928. ems
phasized to his last‘chapel audience
yesterday morning at the close of the
fourteenth annual Conference of Min-
istrs and Laymen. Dr. Gilke’y used
the subject of ”In the World but Not
of It.”

Quoting the words of the Rev Har-
ry Emerson Fosdiclt, Gates lecturer
to Gl‘innell in 15125, to an eminent In-
dian, or. Gilkey stated, “We of the
IVest specialize in transforming the
World all of the East specialize in
transcending it,” It was inferred that
the cause of transcendenclism in the
East was due to the fact that one Iris
dian would not trust the other.

Amcricaus Wish to Braille.

“The West can and must help the
East to transform its outer life,” Dr.
Gilliey continued. “The 'What Is It
All About' Americans characteristic
ally a\'0id. lVe are going nowhere at
sixty miles an hour. This is ’d ques-
iion that our Western civilization
evades; and life will not always let
us evade this.

"We have nothing on the inside
with which to meet disaster. Penc—
trating thinkers and statesmen are
beginning to think of this. Louis Un—
tcrmere s son saw no reason in life,
therefore no cause for living. The
East can teach the West the trans
cendenta] View of truth,”

That science could describe facts
with exceeding accuracy. Dr. Gilli .
affirmed positively, but that lt could
bring about the real, impulsive end.
he denied.

”)laukiui] i Sick Fly."

“Faith in religion is life itself,” he
emphasized vigorously. ,"We need a
revival, a vigour, an interest in senior
thing more vital than ourselves. Man»
kind is a sick fly. It is this 'Eithcrr
0i" truth dilemma which our gencrre
tion must choose between, Only those
can transform the world whose vision
has already transcended it. A con-
stant and inevitable tensionIhas been
formed between the World of 'Is Now'
and ‘NOW to Be.Y

”John Morley says that men of the
world do very little for the world.

“Today the soul is the personality.
What the old word meant has changed
through the succeeding ages. To
save the soul develops a personality,
transcends your own bodily limitar
tions."

Dr. Gilkey refers to himself as a tier
lender of the younger generation-
Prof. H. \V. Norris. who has had
charge of Chapel in President Main's
absence, thanked Dr. Gilkey on behalf
of the college for the lectures dcliv.
ered during the week.

Take Count of Pioneers Here by
Score of 43 to 29; Play On
Even Terms At First.

Though fighting stubbornly through
most ol their game with Kansas Ag.
gies, the Grinnell cagcrs lapsed twice
and the Aggies took advantage of
these lapses to win by two uncanny
.scoring streaks Thursday The final
score was «13 to 29,

The Pioneers and the Aggies played
on even terms the first tiftoep min-
utes. At this point the score was 14
to is, Then the Aggies, led by llertcl,
red-haired flash, started to scoi ind
when the fog lifted the Kansans were
olit in front by about 8 points The
Pioneers then staged a rally and
at half-time narrowed the score 22-17
in favor of the Aggies.

Al: the beginning of the second half
Grinnell pulled up on the Aggies and
held the score at 25 to so until the
latter suffered an attack of basket
fever and made goals from all places
and [mm all angles.

(“rump Is Fast.

The game was fast throughout. and
at the close of the contest both teams
showed much fatigue. Thcrc was not
a moment of stalling during the entire
game, both teams playing to the limit.
The Kansas defense was good; the
Pioneers had a hard time keeping nus-
session of the ball even down under
the basket they were defending.

The Asgics made many follow—up
shots on account of the height 0!
Freeman, their center. For the Kan—‘
sas men, the playing of Mcrtel and
Edwards stood out. Mei-tel was veryl
fast on his feet and a good dribbler
while Edwards was a power defensive-
ly and occasionally came up to take
shots at the basket.

For Grinnell, Coggesboll looked
the best. in spite of his lack of
height he was able often to outiumn
the Aggie men. Wilhelm, who was in-
sertell late in tile game, showed much
light and good floor work.

Recital by Leah Pratt Exemplifies
Qualities Anticipated by Audience

ll, .lilt-cn .uilliguu.

The rich tonC Quality, phenomenal
range, and fine dramatic interpl'eta~
tion which Grinnell audiences have
learned to anticipate in the singing of
Leah Pratt, contralto, were exempli-
fied to the fullest extent in her re—
cital presented ‘chncsday evening
at Herrick chapel, under the auspices
of the school of music.

The great power of Miss Pratt’s
voice was well displayed in the Latin
and Italian numbers of the first
group which included Handel's “Cara
Selve," Bach’s “Agnus Dei," and Mo-
zart's “Alleluia." Her wide range and
fine interpretative ability were im-
portant factors in her effective pre-
sentation of the second groupﬁthrec
songs by Ross descriptive of sunset,
night and dawn in the desert. The
audience showed their appreciation of
these numbers by generous applause,
and the artist responded with an ax,
liilai'ating encore, ”The Sons of the
Open." by LaForge.

M .s Pratt performed the first
scene from the fourth aCt of Vcrtli’s
“Aida” with great Vocal beauty and
dramatic force which gave further as—
surance of her operatic ability.

Ill the four German songs by Schu-
hm‘t which included "Ave Mar r ,” Mi r

Pratt displayed tllc generously Warm
and resonant tone of her V cc. and
the ability to shift rapidly from the
light mood of "HeiderlsRoeslein"
(HedgerRoscs) to the worshipt’ul
mood of “Die Allinncht” (The Omnipr
otence).
Shows Exquisite Feeling.

Lovely nianissimos and exquisite
feeling characterized her interpreta~
tion of “The Velvet Darkness" by
Reddick and “Nocturne" by Curran—
llle first two selections in the last
group. The last song on the program
was "The Song of the Robin Woman"
(Shanewis) hy Cudman, which had
been particularly anti Dated because
of its favorable mention in press no-
tices lrom other Cities. No disappont»
men! was felt in realization, for Miss
Pratt's characterization of the Robin
Woman, her slnootllly»flowing, pon
el‘flll tone, and her clear diction com-
bined to produce a truly artistic ofr
fact. Miss Pratt again displayed in
her filial encore, “The Piper of Love.”
the exquisite slladings and rare inter
pretation which had been exhibited
throughout tho program.

The accompaniments. performed by
Ruth Norton, ’25. afforded an excels

the figure of speech which lllr, Martin

“Deﬁnition and Symbol" Is Topic
of Fourth Lecmre; Stresses
Over-strain in Third.

“One foot and another bears the
burden. and man walks; so it is in
social progress: some individual or
little group goes out ahead. and takes
the llurdcii, until society catches up,-
often society steps ahead and has to
wait for the individual to catch up,"
Thus said Dr. Charles W. Dilkey
Thursday night at Her cl: chapel, in
his fourth lecture ot the Gates Me-
morial lecture series, on “Definition
and Symbol."

“Impossible" Itellltiw iron].

"Every worthy achievement in the‘
history of progress has been made in
the face of jeers of experts and pub-
lic opinion," Mr. Gilkey asserted. Fiﬁ
ty years ago Chicago laughed at Pilll~

iug cars for people to sleep in all

“It is up old story," said Dr. Gil-
key; "this is a living, changing, grow.

word; it is relatives to our ideas.
Religion specializes'in things that at
first look too good to he true. too
great to be believed.

“In its prime, the Roman Empire
seemed the final thing, and that little
company in white, the futile aud
hopeless thing. But the Roman Em~
Dire has crumbled now. and the little
company in white endures."

Some years ago when Dr. oilkey
was sent by his church to attend a
temperance convention in Columbus.
he smiled at the slogan, “A saloohless
nation by mu." Yet he now points
out that the old saloon, once seen on
every corner, is gone forever.

“Human experience," the speaker
said, "rolls like an egg, with no equi»

on end by breaking that end."

“Kingdom of God is Divine Gift,”
Says Evans In Address Thursday

"Mere inconsistency is the hobgob- ,ing by patient training. “A great ma»

lin of little minds" declared Dr.
las Evans in his lecture, “The Kill -
dam of God,” Thursday morning. “It
is the glorious inconsistencies of the
Gospel that make it a living. Vital
thing.”

“The kingdom of God is both pre-
sent and future," the speaker contin-
ued, "and it cannot be Judged from
any one angle alone," He dwelt at
some length on the foot that while
Christ said that the Kingdom is ht
hand and in our very midst, He also
declared it a future thing.

The lecturer concluded his address
with the assertion that the Kingdom
of God is a divine cm, and by it we
find the power to combat the skepti-
clsm sud cynicism of the modern age.

"We could never hope to attain
eternal llfo on our own merlt," in-
ststed Dr. Evans, .. and yet do we not
struggle to achieve the worthiness to
inherit it?"

The Pioneers were not able to cope
with the tight defense of the Nebraska

score of 35 to 22. The game was hard
fought, but the Nehraskans. on ac-
count of their ability to get the jump

Nebraska got off to an early lead
mainly on free throws, and held it.
But the Pioneers soon bog-an to func-

had pulled up within fighting dis-

Nebraskans took on new lite and
