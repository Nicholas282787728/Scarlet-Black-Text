‘Tells Cosmopolitans Fable of the
Peacock and Elephant Sums
Up Indian mind:

"In the Indian table or the Elephant
and the Peacock, the state of mind and
the interests oi the students of India
are summed up,” said Dr Charles W.
Gilkey. Gates lecturer, and recently
Burrows lecturer in India, hetore an
open meeting or the Cosmopolitan club
lastnight

Dr Cilhey went on to tell the table:
“The elephant is strong. but not bonus
titul. The peacock has heauty, but its
voice is raucous. They met on the
street one day, The elephant said
w h a cynical smile, ‘Good morning,
Voice.’ The peacock smiled with
shrewd irony and replied, 'Hello, Face:
And they were square.

Analog, In Occident, Orient.

"The Occident, proud and complac-
ent in its strength, looks at the
oriental peacock, many ot whose beau-
ties it has never seen, and says, ’Good
morning, Vuice.’ The peacock, con-
scious ot the ugliness or the West but
not seeing its strength, replies with a
bitterness that we cannot realize,
‘Hello, Face.”

"The superstition, the dirtiness, and
the poverty of India, is the peacocks
voice," Dr. Gillcer said. “The beauty
or the peacock, its tail, can remain ag—
gravatingly folded up and olit of
sight," he went on. "If in your heart
there is no kindly attitude or interest,
yell will never see it.

"The best glimpse or the peacock’s
tail is in another story. A king trav—
eled a great distance to visit a sage,
and asked him, ‘0 sage, when the sun
has gone down, when the moon has
set, when the ﬁre is out, what is then
the light of man?‘ The answer is the
contribution of India to lite—the pea-
eoek's splendor. '0 kin,’ the sage re-
plied, 'when the sun has gone down,
when the moon has set, whenvthe ﬁre
is out, then the soul is the light oi
Ina“.Y .
Rncilll Prejudice Here.

“How does the elephant look to the
peacock?" asked Dr. Gilkey. "Once
the Indians thought that Americans
loved iair play, truth, and the diplonr
acy ot the golden rule, Now they be-
lieve that America has changed into a
country of race prejudices and
superiority complexes. The restricted

Dr. Gilkey was given this message to

Intramural Games
Continue Saturday
In Two-Four Tilts

Tile intramulal basketball league
continued with games between the
“A" and “B" teams oi Langau hall
Iloys were victorious in the first
game but dropped the second.

In the "A" game, the work of the
building Four crew was impressive
and points to the fact that Dibble may
even yet have a team which will chal—
lenge its right to the undisputed title

 

ol the intramural ledgue,' The For-
eusic outrit worked with a precision
which comes only ireni tenlllwol'l-i, and
had a good passing attack which did
not have much trouble in penetrating
the Lallgzlu defense,

The Forensic crew took the lead at

' the Similar the game and was never

headed. The ﬁnal score was 32 to 22.
13 ding Four had rour men who took
part in a strong oitense—Silhebakken,
Scott, Richey, and Phelps, while Hen-
son was a tower of strength on the de-
lense. The Laugan hall team was
handicapped in not being able to cope
with the Forensic outﬁt in speed. For
Langon, Kent and Jones looked best.

The "B” team atlair was ragged and
uninteresting and the Langanites took
it with the score or 20 to 5. For the
Two outﬁt, Brannon and Briggs star-
red, while Bradtord looked best tor
