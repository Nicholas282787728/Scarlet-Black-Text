Isolation of Freshmen for Entire
Year Is Advised As Means of
Proper Orientation.

WOULD SOLVE OUR. PROBLEM

Charges Court Eleminstted Perl
sondl Touch; Pleas for Personal
Conﬁdence In Dorms.

“The whole question or college gov.
ernment is solved when the house
governments are satisioctory," Presi-
dent J. H. T. Main stated in chapel
yesterday. President Main recom-
mended house government based on
mutual conﬁdence and personal con-
tucfs, and the isolation oi' freshmen
in separate buildings.

“Gl'imlell should not adopt machine
methods. The government must be a
system of sympathch personal rela»
tionship,“ President Main said. “if a
student makes a misestep, the iirst
thing is to secure mutual confidence
and trust. The president must be a
iathenconieasor.

“In our big group, this system
needs a mediator-ethic house chair-
man who has the full coniidcnce oi
the men in the dormitory group.

"The success of house government
depends on the character oi the housc
chairman," President Main said. “He
should be chosen with reicrcnce to
personality, leadership, and loyalty to
the ideals oi liic.

”Our student court eliminated the
personal touch; now let us try the
court oi personal confidenc We
must forget the word 'disciplinc.
‘Lifu‘ is what we want,"

In discussing the relation oi the
ircshmen to the final plan, President
Main asked. “If freshman Week is a
good thing—dud we all agree that it
isiwhy not extend it for a year, 5611*
arating the ireshmen. irom -the upper-
classmeu? Every year the ireshmen
introduce the problem of adjustment;
this college can do no more than here-
toiore to give its ircshmen the right
start.

“Our dormitories are an expression
In brick and mortar of the Grinnell
ideal," President Main felt. "They
are a perpetual challenge to you to
incarnate these ideals. I believe in
the progressive realization of any
great ideal. You are going to reach
niter the Grinnell ideal, until you get
it."

tvalor and our; rotor of such policies.

A case oi in action oi some college
rule is simply indicdti c oi the tail—
nrc oi the violator to adjust himself
completely to his environment, ac.
cording to the Northwestern Dean.
The problem, thcreiorc, or those who
care for such case - one, not oi punr
ialnucnt or retribution, but at careiul,
s mpathctic, nod screntliic aid to the
individual. He must be conditioned to
the requirements oi the college com-
munity. With the help of an expert
guide any individual, who is not de.
fective inherently, can be synchrn~
llized with his environment. At least
that is the opinion or Deau Armstrong.

The logic of his conclusions is ob-
\iolls. it this thing we call disciplinc
is really psychology, and not a matter
of law and law-breakers, it is easy to
follow through to the statement that
students are not quallfied to adminis—
tcr such tasks, Northwestern uni-
versity thus directs this phase oi the
lite oi the men through the Deun's oi-
iice, and as a ieature or major share
in the general program asks each
house, to maintain a high standard of
"home" life.

Perhaps the theory of Dean Arm—
strong will scrv-e to explain the tact
that in general, student scliegovern—
ment is not an issue. Neither students
nor iaculty upon the campusca we vi.
sited desire such a thing or believe it
will up , At any rate, the theory oi
Northwestern univei ty impressed
us as being very inter sting.

Wilson’s Alticle. “Seeing America
In Perspective” 15 Feature
of May Number.

The May Tanager has appeared, oi.
iering its readers an hour or interest-
ing and instructive reading, It is an
attractive literary lunch which prom-
ises to ppeasc the appetite ior some-
thing diiierent and at the same time
not to present any material which dc-
mands much mental effort on the
part oi the reader.

For the iirst time this year the work
or the residing members oi the col.
legc stands superior to that or the
non-campus contributors, The essay,
“Seeing America in Perspective," by
t r. A. M. Wilson, is the outstanding
piece or work in this issue, He de-
scribes from actual experience the
reactions to Europe and her customs
oi the intelligent American abroad tor
the first time. With logical procedure
he takes up the successive stages in
the development oi the traveler's crit.
ical attitude, and draws sweeping con.
clusions that convince one as heingl
true in his case, ii not in all cases.

“Bottle Man, New Style." by Thor—
nell Barnes, is a vivid character mon-
ologue which throws a new light on a
time. often met, but seldom undel‘r
stood, whose method of breaking the
eighteenth amcndment is humorously
individual.

The editorial, by Katherine Simons,
gives various reactions to ”Mother In-
diztl' including her own which is un-
usually pcneirating and fair. “Hus—
band to Spare," a short story by
Deane Storrett, breathes a dclightiul
foreign all: while Il‘win Greenliet's
"Fishermen" cxhnlcs a decidedly salty
one.

Hilda Mauck portrays with her line
tailing charm the ieeliug oi a proud
parent ior his indiiicrent daughter, in
“Alone with Emily." Mary William»
