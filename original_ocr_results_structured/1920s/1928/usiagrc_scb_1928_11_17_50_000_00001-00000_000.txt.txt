“Hail To The Snow

’ ls Song Of

Staff Rimester As Winter Falls

 

But when the snowstorm I must
brave, and venture forth a chilly
night, when slushy snow banks make
me rave and falling flakes obscure
my sight, ah then it is a different
scenc that passes through my bally
bean, and then I dream of grasses
green and zephyrs soft and slight.
The pesky snow creeps down my
neck; the slush climbs up about my
knees; I catch a blooming cold, by
heck, and presently I start to sneeze.
The snow, it falls on bill and dale:
it weaves the earth a garment pale.
but when it snows. I gladly hailimy
hearthfire, if you please.

The snowflakes now begin to fall;
they cover up the barren ground; in
chaste, White robes itppzll'eiietl all,
they nestle down Without it sound
They clothe the naked soil with
white; they hind earth's bleeding
wound up tight, and make the World
look pure find bright for miles and
miles around. I look me irom the
window out, and I cxciaim to see
the show; the world seems virgin and
devout whenever it is covered 50. I
stand beside my glowing fire, while
alabaster flakes inspire, and so ‘1
strum upon my lyre to see the falling
snow.

Organization Plans on Publishing
Anthology of Articles by
Grinnell Writers.

At the last meeting of the Writer's
club illiss Eleanor Lowden gave a
talk on the subject of "A Few Ad-
monitions to Would-be Writer's." The
meeting was well attended and sev»
eral matters at business were dis
cussed.

The club members discussed bids
submitted by various companies for
the publication or a Grinnell anthology
of short stories, essays, drama, and
poetry to be compiled by the Writer’s
club. This is the first time that such
an attempt has been made by the
Writers club; the contributions to
the anthology will be limited to work
of Grinnell graduates and undergrad-
uates. The most favorable bids con-
sidered were those of Haddon Crafts-
man, Camden, N. J., D. Appleton and
Company. New Yor , Ray and Fris-
hie, Grinnell, Iowa.

It was decided at the meeting that
membership would be tor-felted by
any member who was absent three
consecutive times. The reason for
this action is reported to have been
that the club felt that its work was
mainly personal criticism of the pro-
ductions of its members and that this
could be most efiectively carried out
with a small group. The resolution
as adopted it was hoped would limit
the membership to those vitally in-
terested in the functions of the club.

The Writer's club will meet again
next Wednesday and every other
Wednesday thereafter.

Bleyer, Journalism Director At

At Convention.

With the present day vogue of
pets, the Grinnell Pioneers are so-
journing in the wilds of lllissouri to<
day in an effort to locate a cub bear
or so to grace the Grinnell grid tro-
phy case. Man for man, the teams
of Grinnell college and Washington
university stack up about evenlymbut
it is homecoming day in St. Louis.

up to the present time the Pioneers
of rather sad
homecoming experiences, losing to
Drake at Des Moines and tying
the mediocre State Teachers
when the old grads came back to
Cedar Falls. VUnder the driving 0:
Coach Watt, however. the Pioneer
gentlemen have now been trained as
to how to react under such circum-
stances and the best may be hoped
for today.

Driving ‘through four long scrim-
mages during the week's practices,
the scarlet jcrsied aggregation has
brushed up on all the line points of
offensive play and has arranged an
aerial defense which functioned ex-
ceptionally well against all that the
preps could offer. ii h Briggs nab~
hing passes with ability which sur—
passes anything shown thus far this
season the powerful Washington line
may prove no asset to the home out—
iit when the Pioneers take to the'
air. '

Heltlrillgt) Back

The Grinnell line will be bolstered
by the return of Meredith
Heldridge, who suffered a dislocated
elbow in the Drake contest Held-
ridse was the big Star of the Ames
contest and should give the lads at
St. Louis something to Worry about.

Coach Watt is evidently relying
upon the speed of his backfield com-
binations to take the contest, taking
a trio of complete backfields on the
trip and cutting down on the number
or linemen. After the showing made
by Richey and Miner against State
Teachers it is possible Lh‘lli. he Will
use two offensive backfields, with
Rose doing the passing for one and
Ruff tossing the ball for Lhe our
er. ,

The chief weakness of the Wash
ington attack to date appears to be
in the inability or the backfield men
to slip through the holes with the
customary ease. In view of this fact,
Coach Sharpe has been spending the
past few weeks grooming some new
ball carriers, namely Ed hrodage
and Clarence Ax, whom he expects
to inject into the homecoming contest
today in an effort to give the his
crowd the yardage expected.

While the Pioneers have been driv-
ing against the freshman squad dur-
ing the twilight hours since the Tutor
game, the Bears have likewise been
getting in some additional time on
practice sessions with the arc lights
which have been erected over the
gridiron.

The only dope available’gives the
Pioneers the advantage, this being
derived through the 19 to 7 victory of
Drake over Grinnell whilc the same
squad trimmed Washington 20 to o.
The narrow advantage conceded the
Crinncllinns by these figures is offset
by the Washington homecoming to
give both teams an even chance on
advance figuring.
