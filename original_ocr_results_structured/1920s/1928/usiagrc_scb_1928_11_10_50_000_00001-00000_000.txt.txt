The opportunity atiorded grinucll
this year to do it really constructive
piece oi work n China is inimcnsely
greater than it ever has been beiore.
Ci 1 war, taruine and hnnditry do not
prove the hopelessness or our etiorts
here, but point out with greater ems
phasis the real need oi education in
China. We may be able to otter but
one of our students to every soldier-
or bandit. but that one boy will he iar
more instrumental in shaping China's
iiiture and the iuture oi the whole
world than all the ignorant, blind
troublemakers that his home country
can produce.

Basketball, the major interclass
sport tor winter, will undoubtedly

to being a prime ' iavoritc among
women's sports, basketball ' also
claims some oi the best oi the worm

Gl'inllell‘s part in this task of
shaping the ttliinese mind is not a
small one. nor is it one that can be
lightly cast aside by any who have
the interests oi the college at heart
or, m tact, by any who have their
own interests uppermost in their
minds, ior what Cliiua does in the
next iew decades ' going to might-
ily aiicct us all. Grinnell needs to
give more conscientious support to
the school which she has helped to
establish here and which bears her
name; every- tcu spot which she can
raise mcans two and a hali ruontlis
more study and improvement tor
some poor, struggling. though no less
ambitious and deseriing Chinese lad.
l . Poor lliiuipmoiit

Just ivhat Grinnel ' -Chind‘s prcg
cnt needs are is hard to say- tor the
support iroin home has been so start-
lingly meagre in the past icw years
that the school has hccn tor-ced to go
without hope oi doing more than
keep her doors open to those who
wanted to enter here. Her laboratni-e
Kics are run down without the traces

Experimental Theatre Workshop Busy
In Preparation for Crotller’s Comedy

Shades oi evil-smelling contusion:
What have we here? The Experimen-
tal Theatre workshop is truly a scene
at construction although all visible
evidence points to one oi destruction
Asphyxiating odor-s oi paint, glue. and

ng tilter through the dust laden
rir. raucous with sounds ot pound-
ing, sawing. and board-splitting, min-
gled with more harmonious strains oi
by-goue airs emitted train a group oi
cover-allecovered maidens.
. This gathering of extremely
biisincss- ikc looking young women
tire indiistrioiisly employed in tearing
newspapers into small pieces. No.
they haven't a destruction complex,

they iire merely making papier»
mache. What a crcw oi experienced
carpenters, artists, and interior (leer
orators wrll be iorth coming as a re-

sult oi the activity under the Worn-
en's Gym: Yards or compo board,
pounds or glue, gallons oi paint, and
reams of newspapers are being put
to good use every day, And to what
end? Why, the construction at the
sets tor the Pioneer Play, "Express-
ing Willie.”

Mary Stevenson, head or the Con-
struction crew, announces that the
ilats, backings, and clevations have
been completed and the tram oi the
set is up. The iirst rehearsal oi the
play in the theatre was held Friday.
The play is in two scenes, the sets

 

for both oi which are being made cri—
tirely by the construction crew. it
was necessary to revolutionize and
add to the sets at the theatre in or
der to give the eiiect oi space and
height to the living room set, when
the curtain rises on the iii-st act, the
audience will tool like exclaiming
with Dolly Cadwaladcr. “My God, it
is big! it makes rue reel like a pear
nut!"

The sets are to be an exact copy
oi the ltalian, and the gorgeousricss
oi the living room set is obtained
through the use oi a balcony with a
stained glass window, a stairway, and
ltalian tapestries.

All oi the carving on the tiir iire
will be homogeneous as to design.
The crew on props, under the/aired
tion oi liiitli Evans are working out
details to the extent or painting the
dishes to represent italian pottery.
They will also have charge at the
light props.

Ronald Bean and his crew have
charge oi the painting and are al-
ready at work. Stage manager Er]
Morrison and his stait have evalved
an eiiicient manner of changing
scenes quickly. They have arranged
the sets so that one set can be set
within the other, thereby saving much
time in shitting scenes. The play calls
tor a complicated lighting system
which is being worked out under the

management oi Arthur nisser. '

AGAIﬂlUlAHS

Watt Drills Squad Past Week On
Offense, Stressing Running
As Well As Passing.

USES TWO SETS 0F BACKS

Teachers Have Sensational Backs
And Strong Line; Lead Iowa
Conference At Presenli.

Going into a major game today with
the dope favoring them for-.the first
time this year. the Grinuell football
team faced the Iowa conference lead-
ers irom Iowa State Teachers college
at Cedar Falls today. By virtue of
their hard iwon Victory over the
strong Marquette university team last
Saturday, Grinncll is doped to win
over the hcavier Cedar Falls team by
their ‘unczmny pass attack. '

In an eiiort to build up a strong
oiiensive centering around the great
passing attack, Coach L. L. Watt
drilled his men in new pass iorma-
tions. Despite the izict that Grinnell
has been scouted and the Teachers
are an unknown quantity, the pioneer
coaching staii tools that the old plays
supplemented by several new iorma-
tions will be enough to doivn the
Teachers _elevcn.

Norton, guard who starred against
the “Golden Avalanche" last Week,
was counted on to start in todayv
tilt. Walker has been playing Sensate
tional ball in practice sessions and
was subject to call in today's tray.

Heldridge has been in several ot
the recent scrimmagcs and is in cone
ditiou ici- part oi the game. The rest
oi the line has been iuuctiouiug with
the usual iight and Coach Watt plan—
ncd no further changes.

The backiield problem appeared
solved this week when the mentor
started operating his team with two
complete sets oi men hack oi the line.
in his one huckiicld he has Liedtke,
nose, acy and lllclntire, the latter
oi whom likewise works with the oth
er group, oi nichey, Douglas and
liuii, with Miller seeing action, too.
Both quartets smashed the prep de-
icnse to bits in the plays used Tues-
day and Wednesday _ ights, demon—
strating their power. '

Overconiidence has been reared,
even to the extent or placarding the
rooms oi the recitation hall and the
library, but there is little doubt but
that the team realizes that it
will have a hard battle and will be
ready ior it.

Forced to change the Tutor style or
attack because of the serious injury to
Cooper, star triple threat mart,
Coaches Bender and Dickinson have
spent the entire week in an attempt
to throw together a formidable team
to meet the invaders. The Tutors will
have to throw everything they have
into the attack if they expect an even
break against the powerful Grinnell
offensive.
