“Where Freedom Rings” By
Moore 15 Best Number In

Tanager.
POETRY NOT OUTSTANDING

”Mandalay Hi " By Gard Adds
Foreign Touch; Wilson’s
Review Commended.

By Gmcc .iilnun

The July issue of the Tanager neithr
er rises above nor ialls below its
customary standard. it has an agree-
able assortment of articles, not one of
which is apt to impair the reader's
mental digestion. By far the best
number in the issue is the first, Ar-
thur Moore’s “Where Freedom Rings."
This is certainly the most thought—
provoking article; it is concise, flu-
ent easy of style, holds its interests
by the defi iteness with which the
writer states his facts. The phrase.
“Freedom of the Press," has long been
bandied about with great discussion as
to its precise meaning. Mr. Moore, in
his article, efficiently revives the his-
tory ot the discussion, bringing it in-
to the present, and, without moraliz-
ing, leaves the reader secretly amused
at and somewhat ashamed of the aver
age man.

A less subtle, more obviously satiric
observation of the average man is pres
scutcd by Thcrnell Barnes in "Clip
the Coupon." After the success of the
first sally on the stupidity of llnlnan~
ity, he makes an attack on the advel-
tisiog column which says in bold
type: Learn French in Ten Lessons;
clip the coupon. Outside of its genr
eral humorous interest arising from
the author's mockery, the article has
nothing over the average to commend
it. it is mainly an intertaining piece
which relieves the reader of weightier
thought.

Gard‘s Article Interesting.

"Mandalay Hill" by Wayne Gard and
“When the Chorus Girl Reads” by
Howard Peck are interesting but not
particularly exhilarating mental stimu—
lants. The firstis noticeably (be bette .
chiefly for its coherent organization.
It adds a‘ tang of foreign flavor to the
Tanager. The second though less Ol'~
ganized, introduces to the reader a
novel section of life. The average
man will perhaps expect more from
the title 0 (the article than is given;
yet "When the Chorus Girl Rel-ids”
will contribute to the general interest
in the Tanager.

The editorial this month deals With
the forthcoming presidential election.
In so short a. space, the editor is con-
fined to a. general View of the Situar
tion; it is a compact digest plus u
few theories as to the probable out-
come of the nominations.

Poetry Is Mediocre.

None of the poetry is especially dis—
tinguished. The best line of “Year
After Year," by James Norman Hall.
is the last line; otherwise the poem is
inclined to jingle because of its oil-
violls metrical structure. The second
poem, steel, by Raymond Kresensky,
falls into the same error. What
thought the fourteen lines contain is
overshadowed by the meter. The best
of the poetry is to Ruth Atwdter's
credit. Her "Fragments” approxi ate
the sure simplicity of Amy Lowe I

The one short story the Tanager
contains this month is almost detri—
mental to the issue; it holds the
magazine down to its usual Scale
which otherwise might have been sur-
passed. Mr. Sigmund has fallen far
below his ordinary mediocrity; the
story is weak in plot, in characteriza—
tion, and in structure. Through len<
leuce, it could be called an anecdote;
the less said of it, the better.

The book reviews are no worse than
those of former numbers. A review
‘of Hilaire Belloc’s Danton, by A. M.
Wilson, is the most meritorious. Mr.
Wilson is to be congratulated on his
critical ability.

Herbert Hoover was favored for
president. Lindbergh and Mussolini
Were considered the outstanding
world figures of today. Lindbergh
was the most popular. Maude Hayden
and Jane Addams were voted the most
popular Women.

Four Women and Five Men To Be
Elected by Student Body
. For Next Year.

An agreement was reached on the
matter of the revised student govern-
ment constitution, when the student
council committee and the faculty
committee on student organizations
and publications met Thursday after—
noon.

Tbe constitution will be presented
to the men and women of the college
at house meetings Sunday night. At
these same meetings, four women and
five men will be elected to the Stllr
dent council for next year.

The bone of contention in the fac-
ulty meeting and in the meeting of the
faculty committee that evening was.
among other things. byrlaw G 0! the
constitution as revised. This bleztu'
was set down in the minutes of the
Student Council on October 26, 1926,
as having been passed by the faculty
committee on social affairs, but there
seems to have been some misunder-
standing concerning its exact nature,
By—law 6 reads:

“Informal [open houses shall be per-
mitted in the Quadrangle or Dormi-
tory parlors on weekend afternoons
and on Saturday nights when there’
are no other College functions. In the
case of house parties, open houses
may be permitted. Informal open
houses do not take the place of house
parties, and any number may be per
mitted during the year."

Other suggestions tor changes in-
cluded a different manner of electing
officers, a cut in the membership of
the Council, fl change in one of the
committees, the adoption or me name
é‘Student Council of Grinnell College,”
instead of the present "Student Goya
erument Joint Council," and a provis-
ion for presenting Petitions for sem—
ester; fee additions.

“Mary the Third,”

“Mary the Third," which will be
given in the Colonial theatre Satur—
day night, June 2, at eight o'clock he<
fore the annual commencement visi—
tors, is one of the outstanding plays
written by Rachel crothers, Miss
Crothers has made this play one of
the leading American comedies by us-
ing the play to comment on every day
life.

Miss Crothers is recognized as
one of the few successful Women
writers of today. Born in Blooming-
ton, lllinois, she is a product of the
middle west. Atter graduation from
the Illinois State Normal School she
studied at tho Wheatcrctt School of
Acting in New York. Here her inter-
est was turned to play production and
writing and she staged many of the
plays produced there. She is a mem-
ber or various literary and dramatic
clubs and organizations and is the
founder and president of the Stage
Women's War Relief organization.

Miss Crothers is one of the earliest
realists in the United States to use the
play to comment on everyday lite. She
writes in a bright, light vein. Among
the fourteen plays she has written
those which have received recognition
are "Mary the Third", "Enpressing
Willie", “He and She". “A Man's
World," and ”The Heart of Paddy
Whack.”

strn- For Different Marriage.

“Mary the Third" concerns the lives
of three Marys, the grandmother, the
mother, and the daughter, but the
main action of the play centers around
Mary the Third. In the prologue two
brief flash-backs are given at the en»
gagements of both Mary the First and
Mary the Second, which are practical-
ly the same in their earnest assertions
that'theirs will be “the most wonder<
ful love in the world.”

Mary the Third, a typical modern
girl of today. feels that the marriages
of her mother and grandmother have
been failures. and that her marriage
will be "different." She is interest-
ed in two men, but cannot decide
whom she will marry. Her attempts
to decide this and to make sure that
her love will be the "most wonderful
love in the world" lead to a series of
situations both amusing and serious.

The play has been in rehearsal for
several weeks under the direction of
Mrs. ottilie Seybolt. The cast in-
cludes the following:
