Economist At McGill
Says System Wrong

hlontreal, Can. (by New student Sere
\‘ice).~$tephen Leachk, better known
as (I. humorist than as professor of
economics at McGill University, was
hardly joking when he told University
of Pittsburgh students that their Ca»
thedral ot Learning, or “high-up"
building, as he calls it, is (ill wrong.

“I should meter the dream lite and
elm treats of the old college campus
to anything the Cathedral Elf Learning
might offer", he said, “Your Cinn-
pus will he rubber trees on the fa ..
tieth door and the shaded lanes will
be elevator pits.

“I have realized that the world has
changed since my youth. When I
ﬁrst heard of the proposed design tor
the Cathedral of Learning I could
hardly believe that so extraordinary
a building would he put into actual efv
tect. Now l begin to thinh that my
ideals and those of the older generals
tion will go the same path as preju-
dices and hates.

"But even up there on the ﬁftieth
floor", lur. Leacack admitted, “you will
be doing characteristic Work. We
can, lilte the White Knight. in ‘Alice in
Wonderland,’ learn to think upside
down it we only know how,"

young Zona Gale scholar at the Uni—

sentenced ior writing an “obscene"
poem, which was published in the
Daily Worker. The state parole board
agreed with the young poet’s support-
ers that he might be better iniluenoed
by a university than by prison.

The case aroused a great .deal or in

versy. The New York World took up
the student‘s detense, and in this it
was joined by such persons as John
Dos Passos, Otto Kahn and William
Ellery Leonard, There were none,
who defended the poem that resulted:
in the prison sentence. but all insistedi
that more could be done for Gordon byt
permitting him to return to Madison,)

One thousand Wisconsin students
