A new scheme for getting a ride on
the highway has been discovered
lately. A young man recently traveled
tram uecon, Georgia, to North Dakota
by lneans of his novel hoax. He car—
ried an imitation gasoline can. When
sympathetic passers—hy give him a int,
he revealed his ingenuity. A door in-‘
the side oi the can, when opened, re
vealed a change of clothes, a tooth
brush, and a comb.

I BlindfOlded . . in scientiﬁc test l

of leading Cigarettes, Mrs. Morgan Belmont

selects OLD \ GOLD

“In my travels here and abroad I have often wished
that I might ﬁnd a cigarette of pleasing ﬂavor which
would not rasp my throat or bite my tongue.

“The blindfold test has proved to me that I need
seek no further . . . For one of the (our cigarettes
given me to smoke had just the qualities I’ve

always desired.

“The pleasant, smooth cigarette I named as my
choice turned out to be an OLD GOLD . . . No
wonder so many of my friends prefer this brand.
I too ﬁnd OLD GOLD the most delightful cigarette

oi the tobacco plant

 

SMOOTHER AND

r'

“Because they're

madefrom the heart-

leaves of the tobacco
plant"

In case otter case, where
the leading cigarettes
have been compared by
blindfolded smokers,
OLD GOLD has been so.
Iected as the most ap-
pealing cigarette. Be-
cause they‘re made from
the heart-loaves oi the
tobacco plant . . . Na»
ture's ﬁnest tobacco.
That‘s the reason for
OLD GoLD's honey-like
smoorliners. That's why
you can pick them, even ‘
in the dark.
