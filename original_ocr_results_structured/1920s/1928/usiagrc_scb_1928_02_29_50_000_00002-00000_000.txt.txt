SOME STATISTICS

Figures more recent than 1020 are not available at the
presen time. but according to statistics compiled at that
time, approximatel twenty percent or the drinneli stu—
dent body was working. or this group there were those
Who were compelled [0 Work in order to support lllclrlv
selves and those rviio nor-lieu merely tor spending money.
The group that tell betwcen the above clitsstlicdtlmls was
called nollrwol‘kel‘s.

Since 1026 a ne“ system of apportioning college Jobs
has hecn inaugurated. a [act which would srvell consi -
erably the niiiriher who are working at the present time.
Because this group is large enough to command attention
it might be interesting to inquire into their scholastic
standing and relative ability. This working group at
Grinuell is no dittereiit trom any other rvorking group
or college men. For that reason the statistics compiled
by Francis T. )lcCabe at Harvard University may he (av
ken to be as indicative on the Gl'imlell Campus as at
the mudge ’l‘ecliincal School in Cambrige. where they
had their origin.

Based on statistics, a ierv or the ﬁndings are that there

No llise man would dispute the releiaiicy oi education
to the tuture of the world, but we are inclined to disa-

social and intellectual impulses.

We of Grinnell must not develop a spirit or doubt and
alociiiess that would ostl‘acize ii our the world outside

SEEK YE NO FURTHER, DIOGENES . . .

Tnis jolihie Diogenes was a Greek who left his fruit stand for the commend-

able purpose of questing for honesty by good old-fashioned lamp-light. And

now, loud and ever clearer. rings the cry from the hoiisetops: “Diogenes#

throw away your lantern . . . here’s an honest cigarette! Have a Camel

l”

Camels have but one raison t]v étre—to pack the smoke-spots of the world

with the “ lll-fullmelll" every experienced smoker seeks. Fill your own

smokespot with a coal cloud of Camel smoke, and hear it sing out——
“Eureka!" (from the Greek, “Eureka," meaning—“Obey, here 'asi").
