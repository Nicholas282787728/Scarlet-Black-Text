Pointing out the value or faculty

convention, Miss rropp said: “In
Grinnoll, we believe that it is that
understanding on the part or the lac—

us constantly striving to create hotter
standards."

In speaking or the sorority question,
Miss rropp said: “We come back irom
the convention more thanktul than
ever that Grlun‘ell has no fratcrn
or sororities. 'Vl'e do not nced mtr

girls- together. Grinnell does not want
any organization to which any girl

to such membership. We can

“Perhaps there are times in Grin-

“HOW FAR

IS IT to home from here?”

“Oh, just about two pairs
of oxfords.” Morel: in case
the tire decides to go the way
of the weary; if the gas pump
deserts you by leaking; or if
the train goes slower than the
clock just before exam time,
then go to JOE MARCHEL-
LlNo and be prepared for
heavy hiking. But even it all
goes well, it is much easier
to have your shoes ﬁxed here
than when you get home, so
follow our advice and see
JOE.
