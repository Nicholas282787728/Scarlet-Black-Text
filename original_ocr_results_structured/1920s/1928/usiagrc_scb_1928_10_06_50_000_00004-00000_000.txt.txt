Pioneers Illaugurate
Kansas Grid Season

(Continued trom Page 1).

ts of wind and thunder ,was den

ed until the players took the train
in the pouring iain while the entire
male student body braved the storm to
cheer them on their way, Aside irom
some little contusion at the last mine
iite in the endeavor ot those leaving
to secure some slickers, the drumming
program was all that could be de-
sired,

Until almost the last minute it was
not certain whether Bradley would go
or not, owing to his scholastic trou-
bles. A last minute examination put
him over the mark. owing to this
tact, however, Coach Watt was under
termined as to what lineup would
start ills tentative list included
Heldridge at center, Parrish and Nor.
ton at the guards, Klinelelter and
Humphrey at the tackles and rail and
Millier at ends. in the backﬁeld he
planned to use Macy, Richie, Bose and
Mclnﬁre.

, Mentor Does Not Predict

The mentor retused to make any
predictions regarding the outcome.

Richie was out of the Penn contest :

with a cracked rib and Rose was
likewise on the bench with a pulled
muscle. With these two men and
Bradley hack in the tray, the Pioneer
lineup should have presented a really
iormidable tront. Bradiord is rapid
ly recovering irom his wrenched knee
and was undoubtedly in at guard tor
part or the contest. ,

As tor Kansas, with a is to o markin
in l927 and eight letter men to work
on tor another winning agregation, the
advance'dope would naturally slant in
the direction or Lawrence, There are,
however, other things to he consid
ered.

Kansas, it would appear, is resting
on trostbitten laurels. or the eight
letter men returning this year, two
were put out of the opening game by
early season scrimmage. Jack Schop—
tlin was the victim or a cracked rib
while his mate, Olson, is likewise rests
ing in the hinterland with a twisted
knee. Both of these men are out ot
the lineup, right where experienced
men are needed to stop th hidden ball
players or the Pioneer machine.

All in all, taken not too seriously,
as all predictions should he, the dope
really didn‘t give Kansas a big edge
and any slight margin might he over-
halanced by the desperate tight at the
Grinnell aggregation,
