THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

lull alllli tllllli
IN HE’S—Gilli! mills

Regulations Concerning Forward
And Backward Passes
Modified.

or the tour changes madc in the
iootbnll regulations tor 1928, none
have seriously moditied the game as
played in 1927. The changes occur in
sections dealing with incompleted
posses, mulled hunts and tilll:ll1n=, “on
side" and "oil side" in the recovery
oi a kick, and interference on lorward
passes.

The regulation governing income
pleted backward passes has been so
moditied that only those passes which

’bnve been clearly thrown a distance
or approximately two yards through
the air betorc striking the ground.
are now dead at the point or recov-
ery. Such passes are delined in Rule
VI as protected backward passes. Rule
xvn, Section 1 (b) has been altered
to indicate the rights oi all players
when a “protected" backward pass
strikes the ground betore being
caught.

Rule XVII, Section 5, hits been
amended so that it is no longer neces-
sary to draw any distinction between
a mulled punt. and a fumble. After a
ball has been kicked beyond the line
of scrimmage it is to be considered
a. “kicked" ball until it is declared
dead by the referee.

The traditional rules governing "one
side" and “off-Side” still obtain, ex»
cept that if such a kicked hall is le-
gally covered by a player or the kick-
er's side. he may not advance it hes
ycnd the point or recovery.

In Rule xvx, Section 3 (e) the
words “alter the pass has been made"
has been stricken out so that on for-
ward pass plays there can be no inter—
terenoe whatsoever by players or the
passer’s side who have crossed the
line or scrimmage. .
