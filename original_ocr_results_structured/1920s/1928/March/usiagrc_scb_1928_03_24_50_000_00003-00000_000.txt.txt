Believes In
Sane Sex Education

"The problems oi sex arise trom one
ot the basic drives at the very roots
or me. You can let it dcgrade you.
or trom it may come the tinest things
in lite-love, marriage, home and ap-
preciation oi beauty," said Sherwood
Eddy Thursday morning in the A, R
H. auditorium, speaking on "Sex Sani-
ty.”

“I believe in sane. wholesome sex
education," declared Mr. Eddy. “lu-
coleulabic harm has been done in the
past by placing a taboo ot tnlse mod-
estr and silence around the “hole sex
question. But today many are going
to the other rtremc. We must he;
ware not only ot a puritanical, pha
isaical restriction, but oi short-elm
culted indulgence that ends in ruin to

the individual."
In answering the question at how

to determine what is right or wrong,
)lr, Eddy pointed out that no local

' or creed could determine it.
but that perhaps the best test is to
ask whether or not the activity in
question makes lite tiner, richer and
better. ,

“Love and marriage are two of the
tinsst, most desirable results or
wholesome Se‘l lite." said the speaker.
"But in deciding a lite partner, be
sure at yourseli beiore you make your
choice. Find out it your personalities
complement each other. Discover it
you have a great many things in com-
mon. it you then marry, that love-
which continually discovers seine-
thing new in another's lite will he
~rours."

“Above All

Nations Is Humanity"

”A new spirit is growing up among
the nations: that above all nations is
.uinanity," stated Sherwood Eddy, in
long chapel Thursday. "This is a
new age, but we as’a nation are not
in it. We have refused to join the
League at Nations. We have done
much to weaken the new movement,

at, thank God. we can’t stop it."

Mr. Eddy went over the conditions
'n Europe and the Oricat, as he saw
them on a recent tour. “Europe has
lecovel‘ed trom the war economically.
ut she has not recovered politically,"

e asserted. “She has some ten dies

he lost over a tenth of her area and
population and all her colonies, and

FHYOI‘S Debt Reduction.

Mr. Eddy seemed a dynamo of ener.

ions. The European war debts should

it proportion to the disarmament at

Turning to italy, Mr. Eddy said,
