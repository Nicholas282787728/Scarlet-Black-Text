Bears Hope to Stage Comeback In
Homecoming Game Saturday
With Grinnell.

BOTH TEAMS IN FAIR SHAPE

Washington Building Up Defense
Against Pioneers’ Strong
Passing Attack.

St. Loni lo., I\'o H.7Hm'ing rc-
covered from the defeat at the hands
of Drake last Week. the Washington
university Bears have started work
for the homecoming football tilt with
(‘ innell here Saturday. Nu serious
injuries were suffered by players in
The Drake engagement and Coach
Sharpe intends to have the Bears in
the best possible shape in the trope of
giving homecoming alumni a victory.

The Butler, Haskell and Dralre
games torrnd the Bears outclassed as
far as rrreirmower- went. But against
Grinnell Sharpe’s charges will stack
up favorably. This will he Washing
ton's second Missouri Valley tilt.

Washington's backfield again failed
to function last week and Sharpe has
indicated that there will be some fads
ical changes at several positions un—
less same of the veterans show more
than they have in past serimmagcs.

Some of the second team hacks,
notably Ed Brodage, St, Louis and
Clarence Ar, deardsville, lll,, have
been coming along fast the past coll-
ple of weeks and there is a good
chance that both will have a good op-
portunity to try some gmumlrgaining
stunts in the homecoming game.

It is reasonably certain, according
to Washington Scouts, (llat‘Gl'inllell
cannot gain through Washingtorrs
voter-an line and will consequently
takc~ to the ovcrhend game. Coach
Sharpe plans some long scrimmage
late this week in preparing a defense
for thc Grinnell pa sing attack The
erection of additional arc lights
makes it possible to practice the on-
tire lengtlr’of the gridiron long after
darkness has set in,

this season, Clyde Collins, veteran

failed to return to school' this year
and during the early games this
honor was awarded to various play-

The loss of Collins has been made
no, however, by the return of Glazer,

who spent the summer in Europe and
returned to school some weeks after-
the opening of football practice. In
the backfield, the return of Johnny

Grinnell has a slight edge for the
Saturday contest, it the Drake con.
tests are uscd as dopc, for Washing

The hncket, however, is apt to have
its usual unstability.

With the exception of Hobos Macy,
whose leg ininry will probably keep
him out of the gamc the rest of the
season, Crinnell will be up to full
strength on the trip to st Louis. Rose

Speaker Tells of Laws Regarding
Marriage, Divorce, Crimes
In Russia Today.

Marriage is purely a civil matter
in Itussin today," Professor Strong
told the Cosmopolitan club at a meet—
ing in thc Y, w. rooms hlondey night.
"A couple goes to the marriage hur-
eau, signs the papers, and that is all,
Only a third of the people follow this
with a religious ceremony.”

Divorce, .ilr. Strong said, is even
more easy than marriage. If either
party, or both, want a divorce, it can
he obtained by going to the same
office and asking for it. "If a man
thinks his wile isn't speaklng nicely
to him, he can go down town and get
:1 divorce, and wave it 'under her nose
at noon," Mr. strong explained.

“But he can't turn her out of the
house, because under Russian law
women are absolutely the equals or
men. Since living conditions are
very crowded in Moscow, the couple
may have to live in the same house
for awhile. It has happened that two
people got a divorce in the morning,
and both came back married in the
afternoon. Since each side claimed
the apartment, the situation was diffir
cult.

Revolution u’orst Trivia,

"The new sex freedom of Russia
has its had effects. Someone has
said that there are no beautiful worn-
on in Bits a now. Sex has become
so ooimrlon that the women no longer

“There is no capital punislmrcnt in

WAYNE GARD IS CHAIRMAN

No Immediate/Change Anticipated
In Curriculum; Sigma. Delta.
. Chi Petitions Change,

The formation of a department of
ionrnilliisrn at Grinnell college was
announced today by Pres J. H. ’1‘.

English department, in which depart-
ment the journalism courses have
brcyiously been included.

Thls change in departmental organ-
ization does not involve any monies
didte changes in the journalism cur-
riculum. The courses in journalism,

«now: Reporting and Editing, eight
hours; Feature Writing, two lion ,
Editorial Writing, two hours; History

and Editorial Problems and Policies,
two hours, The department of busts
ncss administration offers a two-hour
course in advertising. The matter of
allowing students to apply this
course toward a minor in journalism
is under consideration.

Journalism I’opulnr llerr.

Wayne Gard, assistant professor of
journalism, stated today that he be—
lieycd the formation of‘n dcpartmcnt
of journalism would lead to in—
creased recognition of the college by
national journalism organizations, to
mak' lg more secure the charters of
Gl nnell chapters of journalism fral
ternitios, and eventually to increased
enrollmcut in journalism courses.

The Grinnell chapter ot Sigma De]-
la Chi pctitionod several months ago
for the formation of a department of
journalism.

The enrollment in Journalism cours
es at Grim-tell, though smaller than
that of 'cer-tain other departments,
has quadrupled during the last three
years, and the laboratory equipment
has beenincrcascd.

hfr. Gard, who will serve as chnil'v
man of the new department, came to

Grinnell’s Tilt With Washington
5 Saturday Will Affect Bovh
Teams In Conference.

By virtue of its triumph over the
Pioneers early in tho season and the
decisive victory over Washington unis
ve ity last Saturday, Drake univcru
sity claims the lead in the official
Missouri Valley League standings. By
winning over the Oklahoma Aggies,
Creighton stands at the head of the
column with Drake.

Grinuell has gained sensational vic-
tories over the strong Ames and Mar
quette elevens but those wins do not
affect Missouri Valley standings.
However ,tlrc next two encounters for
the Pioneers will affect Grinnell’s
percentage, A win over Washington
will relegate that team 5.0 the cellar-
and put Crinncll midway in the stand-
ings. The encounter with Creightonl
the week following will indicate the.
final standings.

Grinncll does not meet the Okla—
lrorrra Aggies And this may cause some
objection in the final compilation of
percentages, It will be difficult to
award the conference championship
when all the teams do not meet,

Experimental Theatre Workshop Crew
Busy 011 Sets for “Expressing Willie”

Considering the difficulties uudcr
which members of rho Expcrimcntal
theatre are working in thcir poorly
lightch and ventilated wor -shop,
with its ground floor, uncrcn and
thick with dust, some unusual work
is being done in the construction or
sets and furniture ,tor “E\'13l‘cssing

The lack of work tables and bench.
cs is cnouglr of a handicap, but to
sec members of the staffs standing in
line waiting for the cup s. w and oth-
er tools, and then to examine the re.
sults of their labors, one cannot help
exrlnipung, "How do they do it?"
That the comparitotivoly small space
under the women's gym is nscd for a
college store room and garage as well

tnil [O inspire fun? in thc on-lookcr.

Upset In Holding Pioneer
Squad To 0 To 0.

TEAMS PLAY 0N MUD FIELD

Pioneers Cal-Ty Brill Within Two
Inches of Line But Unable
To Score Counter.

Shifting with scemrng case from the
open, flexible machine which defeat-
ed Marquette with an aerial attack a
week before, the Pioneers used a
powerful driving attack, a slashing
offensive, filled with power, at Ce-
dar Falls last Saturday only to be
turned back with a o to 0 score.

The heavier Tutor squad was out-
played. There is no denying the fact
that Gl'inneil was in Teacher-s terri<
tor-y for nearly three quarters of the
game, that the scar-let-iersied men
were only four yards away from a
score at the end of the half and that
they were turned back another time
with a bare two inches to go. For
the first time this year, however,
Grinnell was outfonght. Doped to
lose, anivious to uphold its honors as
leaders of the Iowa conference, and
above all, playing before a homecom—
ing crowd of 4,000 people, the home
aggregation pitted superior weight
and a desperate fight against the vis<
iting aggregation.

Pioneers Nearly Score

Grinnell got away for a bad start in
the game when :reachers recovered a
fumble on the Grinuell 20 yard line
on the second play of the game, The
greater part of the opening period
was taken in turning back the Tutor
invasions. In the second quarter the
Grinnell march down the field was
taken up, and cracking the line and
ends for four, five and six yards
nearly every play, the best prospects
were in order. Nearing the goal,
however, the Pedagognc fighting—nia-
chine stopped the onrush and the
half ended in a tie.

Teachers received insthe .second
half and promptly marched down the
field with a varied passing and line
attack to scoring position, only 10'
find that the Pioneers likewise had
some fighting ability when called for.
Griunell took the hall again and Went
the length of the field with a driving
attack, threatening but being turned
back with two inches to go. Late in
the game G milell again was in »c
scoring position but failed to make
the yardage when inside the 10 yard
line.

)ljllcr, lticliey star .
hchnskcy, the touted ace of the
Tutors failed to get away for any
long gains; reeling off 15 yards once,
however. on the other hand, the fa—
nrous aerial attack of Grinnell was
totally missing while the Teachers
aggregation did complete several
passes for some long gains.

The field upon which the game was
played was much muddier than it
looked from the sidelines and in a
comparatively few plays all men were
well soaked. Tire field was lined
with lime, several of the Pioneers sut-
fering from lrnrcbnrns on their
shoulders. Captain Fail was injured
in the second half when he was the
main participant in a head on collis—
ion while scrambling for the ball but
will he in the lineup next Saturday.

Individual honors tor the entire
contcst go to “Eppie” Miner and
Claude nichsy, a pair of substitute
backs who skirted the ends and
tackles for gains continually, while
noso cracked thc line with his usual
