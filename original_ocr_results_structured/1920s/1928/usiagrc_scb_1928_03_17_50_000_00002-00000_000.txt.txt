A sreot deal has been llil about the value ot "\lm'lir

boy him we s long hours and many oi them to earn
money eliougll to pay his “ﬂy through school, oiten hears
his work commended as being a vuludble part oi his edllr
cation, and many a iiindly pat on the shoulder is
given him with the assurance, that while he “may have to
Work, his education \\‘lll mean inure to him because
or it." All of which, in our humble opinion, is an
antiquated notion which ought to be dispelled, and the
sooner the better.

school at law. where it is d Wellrlillml'll (not that students
seldom have any ext .t time to devote to working
their way through school, it they are to get the roll
heiietit oi their college training, Even while the liberal
arts course is not as exacting as the others, it can very
proiitnbly be made a twenty-ioni- hour ii day Job it the
studcnt gives his studi , his social obligations and his
athlctic and “outside" activities the attention they
deserve.

For those who point out lllatwol'klng students often
get the best grades, we can only oiier that they do so
in spite at their extra worh. not lit-cause of it. To say
that the mere ‘ ct of working one's way through school
has any idv .blc bearing upon one‘s grades is on
absurd as to say that birth in it log cabin is one or the
essentials at election to the presidency. Ii we take two
students or equal mental capacity and sincori 1, and
iorce one ot them to wot-h his way through school, the
other student will come out ahead every time.

\Val‘liing one’s way through school istit best a neces-
sary evil. It a strident puts in only a illoderzltc amount
or time at his job it may have no appnreiit ailect either
on his grades or the oeuelit he receives iroui college,
but it his wol'k reaches the point where it interieres
noticeably. with any phase oi his true college lite, he may
iind too late that the time spent at his job has been a
liability rather than an asset to him.
