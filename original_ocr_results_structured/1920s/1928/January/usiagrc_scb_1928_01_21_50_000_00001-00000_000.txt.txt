try, Whlbu’is his. first. began last
week and will extend for several
months, during which time he. will
lecture, in English, in all of the prin-
cipal cities.

Gives Personal Views.

A row weeks ago Ludwig gave an
interview in London which set forth
quite detlnitely his vie s on letters,
war. genuises and nohi ty. He said
that he early gained an innate hatred
for history and recently he began to
write it because of this hatred. it is
through his work as an historical
biographer that he has become one
of the outstanding personalities in
Europe today.

in his biographical endeavors.
Plutarch and Carlyle are his masters.
He strives "to emulate from afar
those _dn ~alleled psychologistsAtlie
one in his immaculate iucidity, the
'other in his volcanic energy.” Luth
wig does not write for a Lytton
Strachey audience for he confesses
that his ambition has been to renal-tin
mate and remold any material so that
the man in the street will feel as
though he saw living men.

His Task Is Grilllt'l.

”What task can he grander than to
stimulate—and above all' stimulate
the young—by the example of great
men, and show that each was but a
man, exposed to’ the limitations, dif—
ficulties, perplexities, and sufferings
with which we all must contend."
Ludwig believes that it is as import-
ant to tell how many steins of beer
Bismark could drink at a sitting as it
is to discourse on his political mas
tory.

"1 am a toe of the historical novel.
lorito quote Gnethe~it is destruct-
ive alike to history and to imagine
tion. My ideal is rather portrait of
incontrovertible documentary authens
ticity, which yct shall suggest
dramatic narrative.

“While 1 never read a book about
the man i am delineating, but go
straight to the sources no matter how
remote, which give any source oi
trustworthy information, my endeavor
is to test the impression 1 have re
ceivcd from a picture, a letter, a re—
mark, at every- stage at my reading:
and 1 have very oftcn been compelled
to reverse that impression in the les-
ser, but never in the large sense.

Wrote of Goethe From Portrait.

”At the time when 1 lroew no more
about Goethe than every German
knows, 1 wrote the history of his
soul, from his portrait in ten pages."

Speaking of war, "it was a pitiable
behavior of a class whose moral dual-
ities had begun to tail. 1 had begun
to have my doubts toward the end or
the warAlt was the collapse of so
many royal houses without any at.
tempt at self-defense4whicll showed
me that the era of the privileged
classes must be drawing to an end:
for he who gives in without it fight is
unworthy of command."

Ludwig wrote the drama, "The Dis—
missttl," solely [mm a desire to lms
part his (Bismark's) views or war to
the nation.

“In other ways 1 have tricd to op—
pose war, since its technique now
precludes heroic deeds. Europe has
become our native land in a new
sense; tor since airplanes have made
Paris and Berlin neighboring cities,

SWIMMING EYSEEM IS
UNINNEﬂ-JNHNEN

Grinnell Practically Only School
In Country Where Mixed Glass
Could Exist, He Says.

”Grinnell has a swimming organi-
zutlon which is unique in the colleges
oi the Middle Wes , ‘T. B. Turner,
director of swimming in Grinnell, told
a SCARLET AND BLACK reporter
yesterday. “Every Saturday after-noon
from three until four o'clock a group
of the best men and women swimmers
in school meet at the pool and go
through a program or water stunts
and games.

"Grinnell is practically the only
school the country where such a
group could exist. At iowa City and
Ames the men and women have Reps
arate pools. At Drake the social or-
ganization is such that no such class
would flourish. But here. where the
social life is so compact, we have
been able to conduct a mixed class
and make it one oi the most helpful
and interesting on the campus.

To Limit Grouli.

"We are in the near future going to
limit this class to men nud women
who can pass certain tests. For axe
ample, if a man can swim toriy' yards
in twenty-seven seconds or execute
ton recognized dives or pass any at a
number of other tests. be may join
the class. You see, the rcouircmcnts
are not excessive, the best swimmers
negotiate torty yards close to twenty
seconds and there arc, several more
than ten dives which the amateur can
learn, but at the. same time, this
mits the organization to the better
swimmers.

"it is interesting to note the differ-
ence in methods oi teaching swim.
ming, At Amcs the whole thing is
systematizcd. A group' of tiny or
sixty may be in the pool at the same
time doing exactly the some thing. in
lows City thc methods are about the
same. The individual is even expect—
ed to count as he makes each stroke.
llere at (‘rriuilell our method is mori-
individuai, Dur classes are small
cnough so that we can give each
member persouol instruction, point
out his fault. show him how to im-
provc hi. .tvic, and observe his ims
movement as an individual swimmer.

Ill-vclop ludiiiduul Style.

“It seems to me that one of the ad
vantages or this method is that when
one has learned to swim nne has also
learned to like swimming. The feels
ing is not that the beginner is being
cut out to a pattern but that his spo-
clal style has been developed as far
as possible.

"When i was visiting a swimming
class in a certain mid»Weslem uni-
versity ‘early this fall 1 saw a class of
more than a hundred. The pool was
so full that first one group would
dive in and then the next group would
dive over the tirst. 1 was back to vi-
sit thc some class a week or two ago.
it had dwindled to less than twenty.

Plan Devised by House Chairmen
To Aid Senate, (lo-Operate
With Men's Court.

IOWA, SAT

A plan for the extension of build—
ing government. submitted to the
men living in the six men’s balls dun
ing the last week, was voted down by
all the buildings except Smith hall
and Building Four.

This plan calls for a house
mittee composed of not less than
three members. and not more than
‘x members, all of whom shall be
juniors and seniors and one of whom
shall be the house chairman, serving
as ex officio chairman of the com-
mittee; one member of the committee
must also be a Court member.

The purpose of the plan is to aid in
the enforcement of Senate rules and
to make over provisions for the bet
terment of building life. These
House Committees to have been elect-
ed under the plan, would have had
power to punish oftending members
of their respective buildings by 35a
scssment of fine, by expulsion from
the building, or by recommendation
to the Student Court that the mend-
ers be expelled from college.

The plan presented is as follow:

Grinnell Forensic
Issues Its History

Growth 01' Speech Activities Is
Recorded. In Pamphlet.

To give a. comprehensive idea of
the development of forensic activity
at Gripnell college, Grinnell Forenslc
has recently issued a history of the
organization and of the new project re~
ccntly formed by it and adopted for
intercollegiate speaking activities 7
the undergraduate Speaking Er-
change.

The booklet begins with an account
of the founding of literary societies at
Grlnucll in 1352, of their increasing
influence and popularity. of their cons
trol over intercollegiate debating, and
oi their decline after the erection of
the men's dorms in 1921. it con-
tinues with the story of the former
tion of Forensic in 1925 as the suc-
cessor to the literary societies, which
disbanded in that year, and of the
organization's activities since that
time. g

liriugs Ont .icccmplisluuouts.

Some of the accomplishments of
Forensic brought out in the pamphlet
include the successful management of
two debate seasons, including dc-
botes with Cambridge and Harvard
univcrsitics. and the equally success-
ful promulgation of the Merrill inter»
dormitory debates. Durmg the two
years of its existence, such men as
Francis J. McConnell, bishop of thc
iietbidist Episcopal church, Charles
A. Woolbcrt, professor of speech at
the State University of lowa. Ralph
bar-ton Perry, professor of philosophy
at Harvard university and Frederick
Mcrk, professor of western American
history at Harvard have appeared be»

hopeless for Grinnell, but with the in—
icction of Ingram into the fray, the
Pioneers seemed to take on new lite.
At half time Drake led 16 to 12.

Immediately after the second half
began, Drake made two easy shots in
quick succession to boost the total to
twenty Then the Pioneers began to
do business, and, led by Davis and
ingram, they soon held on to a 23 to
22 lead. From this time on the Pio»
neers kept a slight lead, but never
once did they start to stall. They
kept up their orfensive tactics, and
when the whistle blew they were still
going strong.

Zvacek Outstanding.

For Drake, Zvacelr, with his un-
canny long shots, was easily the most
outstanding light. The far tamed
“Barney" Meyers was watched very
closely and had to be content with
one field goal for the evening. The
guarding of Jack Barnes, Drake man,
was good, and his offensive work was
also commendable.

with Prof. Leopold Auer, winning
first prize at the Petrograd Conserva-

her: "Hansen is not only the greatest
