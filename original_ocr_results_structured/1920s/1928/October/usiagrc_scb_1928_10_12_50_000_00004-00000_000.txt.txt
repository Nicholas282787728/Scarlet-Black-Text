Hailing from the TrirC‘lties, Royce
doesn‘t. like to hang onto his post too l
ranch, and Charlie Briggs, black hair—l
ed typist deluxe, .t 166 pound led from
Davenport, takes his place at inter—
vals with a number 17 as identified-
tiorl.

In case you see u thrice thirteen
on the field, as to be exact, mark it
down as Otto Golz, Its pounds or‘
ﬁghting Dutchman from Fontanelle,
who is all there as a. \Vingman.

Outstanding among the sophomore
linemen of the year is Carleton Hunts
phrey, silvis, Ill., who handles his 180‘
pounds with ease and works right
along with Capmin Fail with nary a
hitch. He gets the regular call at‘
tackle with Paul Klinefeiter. I'lsl
pound veteran from Conrad, Iovi , on
the other sides Humphrey goes un-
der the number 21 \l'i'lh Klinefelter
setting them dizzy under,a 33 ior‘
identification.

Bmilley Weighs lil7 Pounds

While speaking or tackles, why not,
mention Evenor Bradley, the biggest‘
man on the squad, at 197 pounds, who
when credits permit, plays unywhere‘
needed on the line and shoves his
number 15 into the thick ot- the tight.

The guards are is. hit lop-sided but
right on hand, nevertheless. Charles
Parish is right at home on the grid
here, living in town. Consequently
he wastes little time looking over the“
field, and has a well developed ability
to follow the ball. If there's a. fumble
against Ames, you'll see hlin, or at
least. his number 18 sweater over the
ball. He recovered a Kansas fumble
at Lawrence and intercepted a Penn
pass tone touchdown, here. His Isl
pounds doesn't match with his mate,
however.

0n the other side of the middle is
that huge hull-K, Freddie Norton, who
hauled all of his 146 pounds from
Denver, Gold, to be a bulwark on the
Grinnell line. When Coach Watt gave
out the sweaters he said, "23 for
yours," and Freddie replied, as 146
pound guards are wont to do, "thank
you," Norton is another sophomore

who is ﬁghting his way into the holl-
ored few.

Two quarter hacks are enough for
any team, and Grinnell has a pair

ranking ace high with any list of the
elite in gridiron ethics. Ernest Vic-
Intire, Audubon, Iowa, runs, pa s.
kicks and incidentally handles the
team on the field, to gain any worthy
title onlookers may see ﬁt to give him,
Supporting him, however. is Dd Lied-
tke, pronouncing the y as in milk, who

Macy and Douglas will probably be
in at the halves, today, too. Macy,
who answers to the title, Howard, has
had two years experience, and shows
it when it's needed, Weighs 155 pounds
and comes from Lynnville, Iowa. He
carries number 20, while Douglas, of
Cedar Rapids, has to be satistied with
number 6. but his 172 pounds still
works in at halt easily. Douglas
shares the printing duties with Mc-
Intire, also. '

l Campus Opinion i

Do you think tlutt a college straw
vole cnn reﬂect the attitude of the
country!

Horton Knapp: "No, because college
students are on a higher level of
learning than the average run of
voters."

Donald Goodman: “In a way, yes.
However, straw Votes are more or less
authentic."

Bonnie Rice: ”Yes, in it wity. but
allowance must be made for the fact
that very oiten not everyone is in
clniled (ind many vote there who are
not old enough to vote at the polls."

Mllrguret VVOOLl: "No, because col-
lege students do not take it seriously
because they know it does not vitally
:oncern them "

June Carlson: “No, because straw
votes are seldom reliable and college
students Vote loalishly just for the
Inn of it."

Marjorie TOXSE: "Yes, because the
students here are a representative
group."

Catherine Curl" “A college straw
vote is not as reliable as one taken
in a university”

Walter secor: “If it is in favor or
Iloover it reliable, otherwise it is
not."
