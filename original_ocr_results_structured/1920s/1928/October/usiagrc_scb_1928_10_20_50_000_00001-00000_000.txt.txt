ed courses will also be open to how
students qualified to take them.

It will be po ‘lble, under this are

Unusual advancement is being
shown by the women's swimming
classes. particularly in the beginning
sections, according to Miss Harriett
Koglin, director of swimming. At the
end or three \vceks' instruction the
beginners are ahlc to take care of
themselves in the water and to use
the back stroke to good advantage
in swimming back and forth across
the tank.

The advanced section is now con-
celltrating on at ng, while very satis-
factory. work is being accomplished
in the intermediate di stop, now
perfecting the various strokes. .

Owing to the inclement weather
which has prevented use of the ten-

Beauty of Southwest Described By
Fisher In Lecture Thursday
Evening In Chapel.

Dr. Frederick vi ing Fisher, well
known lecturer and author, save his
illustrated lecture, "ulti ate Ameri-
cu," Thursday evening ‘ in Herrick
chapel. Mr. Fisher, who is second to
appear on the Grinnell college lec-
ture course this year, dealt almost
entirely with the great Southwest of
the United States. Intcrspcrscd with
these views, the speaker showed a
number of foreign scenes,

With two hundred and fifty hand
painted dissolving views which gave
a colorful panorama to the towering
mountains, deep canyons, and pictur-
esque cities of the great Southwest,
Dr. Fisher led his audience over
sccnic trails through Colorado, Utah,
Wyoming, California, the Catalina
Islands, the Panama canal Zone and
other parts of the continent.

The snow-clad mountains of Colo-
rado and Utah’s and Wyoming's
magn cent canyons and hidden
beauty spots were excellently inter-
preted by the slides and verbally de-
scrihed by Mr. Fisher. "California’s
idcal weather, beautiful drives, jas-
ged seaboard, and famed movicland
are most attractive," declared the
lecturer, who is a native and resident
of that state. .

The Catalina island and its quiet
surf were pictured The canal Zone
was illustrated and described as it
now appears and as it looked under
construction.

Dr. Fisher, who was educated at
Yale, posscsses an unusually pleas-
ing stage hrcsencc. For years his de»
criptions of the vivid parts of our
country have delighted his listeners.

Freedom In Teaching is Emphasized At

"Freedom in tcachlug with cmplia-lcd a little over lilil'ty years ago and

sis laid on creative w ting and the
study of current literature were the
outstanding tendencies which I found
at the, state University of Montana
this summer." stated Professor Maclr
when interviewed by a reporter of
this publication,

“There was a spin of experimenta-
tion out there that is not found in the
oldcr schools farther east," contin-
ued Mr, Mack. “They focus their at-
tention on the world in which we
live."

The summer session at which Mr.
iiack taught had been widely udvcr~
tised hy the university in conjunction
with the Chamber of Commerce of the
city of Missoula. where the univer-
sity is located. The university's most
effective appeal to summer school
students was that it offered recrea-
tion along with education. The re-
creation consisted of weekend trips
into the mountains which \vere‘con-
ducted by the Professor at the head
of the journalism department

is well acquainted with the country.

First Dramatic Club Play To Be
Staged November 2 , Cast
Completely Filled.

Saturday, November 24 is the date
set for the first Dramatic club play
or the year. “Expressing Willie." The
play is a satirical comedy of a sophr
isticatcd lifc laid in the Long island
home or Mr. William Smith. called
Willie by his mother. Willie is a typ-
icul midwestern business man of the
‘hewly rich' type and soon falls prey
to a group of designing fortune hunt-
ers. The plot is concerned chiefly
with the arrival of Minnie, an old
sweetheart ot Willie's. and the means
hy which Willie learns to express
himself. which in the end, he does
with great determination.
The cast is as follows:
Whltcomh, Willie‘s former sweeL
heart. Margaret Jean Howell; Mrs.
Smith, Willie’s mother, Margaret Wei-
shaar; Willie Smith, Ford Stewart;
Tallafero, an artist, Edward Donni-
field; George Cadwalder, Drcwster
Woodbum: Dolly Cadwalder, Alice
Millard; the sophisticated Frances
Sylvester, Margaret Napier; Rey-
nolds, a footman, Howard llcllrath;
.iean, the maid, Dorothy Luring,

Minnie

"Expressing Willis” is probably the
the best of Rachel Crothers’ comedies,
and she has been acclaimed by crit-
ics one of the best women playw
ers in America. The characterization
and production of the play is ditlicult
because of its extreme sophistication
dull the high level of comedy at which
the action must be kept throughout.

most of the buildings have been built
since 1922. Thc cnrollmcnt averages
1400 students for the winter sessions
and about four or live hundred for
tli summer quarter. The university is
situated in a bowl in the mountains
many of which are snowcapped
throughout the summer months,

In spite of the fact that Montana
is 900 miles wide it has only about
a half million inhabitants from which
to draw its taxes. The Anaconda Cope
per Compim dictates a good share
of the anti es in the state and in
some degree dictates to the univer-
sity. The Montana people however
do not regard this as vicious and
seem to tool that the benefit from the
organization overwhelms any of the
dictatorial acts which it does.

The University of Montana is made
up of four units and the State uni-
versity at Missoula is one of these.
The University of Mines at Buttel the
School of Agriculture at Bozeinan
and the State Normal at Dillon are
the other three units.

It seldom rains in that section of
the country Professor Mack said and
the Univer, ty in order to keep its
campus green runs 225 sprays which

bucket of the type celebrated in song
and story. it has the scores of all the

Grinnell in the last (arty yea'rs paint-
ed on its sides. It has been kept in
the trophy-room ht Drake, where it

team, or the Drake captain. if the
same is a tie, will take possession
