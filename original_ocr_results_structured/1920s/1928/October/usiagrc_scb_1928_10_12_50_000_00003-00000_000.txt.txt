history of Homecoming
Reveals Origin in 1912

The sixteenth anniversary or crime
hell's homecoming is being celebrat-
ed today. The custom wits started
in 1912 and had a rather desultory
history until alter the world war.
since when it has been kept without
a break except in 1920 and 1:322.

Grinhell has won tour oi its border
coming games, tied two. and lost rive.
For many years Cornell college cons
tended with Griunell ior gridiron hon-
ors on Homecoming day, but oi late
years it has always been either the
Drake or Ames team which played the
celebration game with the Pioneers,

The first homecoming game in 1912
decided the college ioothall title oi
the state. which Grinnell lost to Cor-
nell by a score oi 10-0. That year
the pep meeting, smoker ior the alum—
ni, homecoming dance,'and Dramatic
club play were all rolled into one in
a big gathering held in the Associa-
tions buildings in honor oi the “Old
Grads,“

No Celebration in 1913

In 1913 there was no homecoming
celebration held. but a year later a
iour day celebration was held, clic
maxed with a win over Cornell by a
score oi 14-0. Other events that lens
tured this long celebration were
a speech by Senator Cummins, a sour
cer game as well as the irosh ioot-
ball game, and alumni banquet, and
a "mix” that took the place or the
smoker and dance to he held this year.

The next year a reunion was held
in Des Moiues in connection with the
State Teacher's convention, which
was not really a homecoming, but did
feature the Drake~Grinnell game in
which Grinnell came out on the heavy
end oi a 53-0 score. A stag banquet
was held at the Savery hotel the night
heiore the contest which was in the
nature at a pep meiing to develop
enthusiasm to rthe game on the role
lowing day. A cabaret ieature was
put on at the banquet by members oi
a Des liloines vaudeville troupe. . *

Dedicafed A. 1L IL in 1911}
The dedication oi the Alumni Recl-

 

tntion hall marked the this homeconn
ing. This was a long celebration also,
lasting irom Thursday to Sunday. Erie
day was an oiiicial holiday. There
was a soccer game with Minnesota
played as the prelude to the main at»
traction oi the day. the GrinnelILCor—
nell game. which added a 19-0 victory
to Grinnell's record. The night he-
iore the game a banquet was held tor
the opposing team in the quadrangle
dining room.

The Dramatic club play was made
a part oi the homecoming celebration
ior the ﬁrst time in 1919 aiter two
years during the war without home-
comings. A carnival and a be»
meeting in charge or the Honor G
composed the preliminaries to the
Grinheleroruell game that ended
with a 7-7 score. About 150 Grinnell
Alumni attended this homecoming.

Meet in Des Moines

Another Grinnell banquet in the
Hotel Saver-y at Des Molnes substi-
tuted a reunion or the alumni ior a
homecoming program in 1520, but in
1921 Cornell drubbed Grinnell 13—0 on
a snow covered iield tor the home-
coming celebration. Preliminary to
the game was an Armistic parade, as
homecoming was on Nov. 11 that year.
A special issue oi the SCARLET AND
BLACK was put out tor the homecom-
ing crowd and the celehration was
topped oii by a special "rec" hour
that included a little or everything in
the way or entertainment that the
college bad to otter.

Although homecoming was not oi-
