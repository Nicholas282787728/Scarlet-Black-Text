WHO SAYS

OU'LL starve if you don't

get up for breakfast.”
You don't need to, [or Slater-s
has grapefruls—S [or 26C.
You could get potato chips
there too. And listen! here's
a new idea. Do you ever
eravc some or Mother's mush?
Well, they’ve got it for line a
package and it's good. Here’s
for bigger and better sleeps
and breakfast from Slater's.

A NEW PLACE

TO GO slioppiftg, is the

DeLuxe shoppe. just across
troni Candyland. Honestly,
I've never seen such cute
painted hankies as I saw
there Dont' you love them?
And such cute greeting cards.
You may solve some of those
(‘hl'lstmas problems there.

FOR HIM.

WHOEVER he may he, 01'
where there is something
at Kutish . They have the
best looking line or leather
goods, all out on display in the
center aisle. You can't help
but see the tooled hill tolds
and key rings, the bridge sets,
correspondence cases and cig»
arettc lighters. Before buye
ing his present stop in at the
cigar store, and you wont'
have to go any further.

Any ay. just let me
say this i it’s jewelry you're
looking loritllal's the place
to get it.

FOR MOTHER
AND Dad, too, because he'd
get just as much enjoy-
ment out of it as she would.
get an automatic electric
toaster of the Birchard Elec-
tric Co. You know. the kind
where the toast pops up by
itself when toasted # what
could be easier? Then you'd
never hate to eat burnt bread
any more, wouldn't that be
nice? Or it they ali'eady‘
have one, get a table stove.

wattle iron, or grill.

IT‘S JUST ABOUT NOW

HAT shoes and soles begin

to wear out and it dawns
on our feeble minds that the
reason tor such hasty des-
truction is that we have to
walk everywhere instead of
ride as we do at home. But
let me tell you something.
JOE MARCHELLINO has the
cure to this ill, he’ll resole or
mend shoes and we can last
the winter out undisinayed.
