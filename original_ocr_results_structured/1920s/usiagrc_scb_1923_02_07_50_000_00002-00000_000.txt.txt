THE BEGINNING

“The Oracle is dead! Long live the
Cour 1” is a. free translation of the
sentiment of a great majority of the
men of Crinnell today. They have
dacrccd, by an overwhelming ma-
iority, that the Oracle should but be,
and that the new Court shall mke its
place. The experiment in self-govern-
ment which we are conducting here
now becomes a reality instead of thc
dream of a few or merely a plan on
paper, The new system now enters

upon its most trying period of exiSr
tencc, if ll. is to exist, and we believe
that it will.

The Court will now take over the
duties of the Oraclc and seek to dis-

, charge them to the best of its ability,
and in addition it should endeavor to
promote a feeling of cooperation and
good will which the oracle could

never do. There are numerous dif—
ficulties which will have to be ironed
out by the court itself. The constitu-
t'ion purposely gives the Court almost
unlimited freedom in choosing its
method of procedure in meeting these
difficulties. It should be a powerful
and dynamic organization. it offend-
ers called before the Court are re-
calcitrant or are wont to commit sec—
ond offenses. then the court may
have to resort to open meetings in

which the men of the school take a

more or loss direct part. This is left
to the Court.

The Men’s Senate is a legislative
body, whose actions are not likely to
incur the disapproval of the students.
But it is different with the Court.

critical eyes.

The feeling between Gi-inncll and

that great care should be taken in

than anything else to prevent the re-

at Des Moincs, which furnished the

inspiration for Secretary Taylor's rc-

A letter from Grlnuellrin-China states
that the students there are getting up a
college song. They havc selected the
tune ot the Crinnell Alumni Song.’ A
contest for tho submission of verses

VICTOR 1’. IORRIS.

Victor 1’. Morris was born in Sioux
city, but lived most of the time in
Oregon where he graduated from
high school and college. He received
his A B. degree from the University
of Oregon in 1915. For two years
he was principal of the high school
at Myrtle Point, Oregon, where he
also taught, and ior two more years
occupied the same position in the
Eugene, Oregon, high school. The
year 1920 was spent in the School of
Education in the University of Ore-
gon. During this year also he ob-
tained his A. M. degree. The 'next
two years Mr. M0 is spent in Colum»
hia University, in New York, in the
Department of Economics, specializ-
ing in the ﬁeld of labor. During the
first part of this time he did special

What DO You Tlllnk i

To the Editor of The Scarlet and
Black.

As an ”Argllﬁer” Joe Kelly, is, it
mﬂy he presumcd, not one to he sniffed
ill, or to he recklessly challenged; so
ll. may seem presumptuous on my part
to throw my glove in the ring: per,
haps doubly so, as you so ably
answered part of his argument your»
Self, in your editorial, However, he
that as it may, I should ikel to answer
one questoill that Mr. Kelly propoumls,
to the undergraduate body Of (his col-
lege, and in answering it i happen to
know that I am expressing a view that
is commonly held; even more gener-
ally, perhaps, than I myself realize.

Ml. Kelly Will grant, I hope, that
the Tu'l'lctionithe highest function—of
the courts is not necessarily the pull—
lshmeut Of Crime, but the discourage
meut Of crime. Just as the highest
function of a. physician is not the ctlr~
ing of disease, but preventing disease.
That, I take it, requires no argument,
but is a basis on which be and I might
argue. He, that the Oracle discour-
aged infraction of College rules, and I,
that the New CDuI’t will discourage in-
fldction of rules. Each one 0: course,
seeing that We might agree will add:
"better than either the Old or the
New" as the case may be. On lhdl.
point there is little hope of agreement
between us. He has presented his
case; it has in pflrt been refuted by
you; and now i wish to take up the
cudgcl.

Should I rather be called "up" be-
fore the Oracle, 2. secret hotly, hear
its rigamarolc, and know that no one
need know anything about it? Or
should r rather be called before men
whom I know, whom I helped elect,
and who, if they Wished, Could make
a public example of me? Most as-
suredly, my answer would be that
which Mr. Kelly expects. “Before the
Oracle."

Now let me take at different tack.
Will Mr. Kelly quibble with me when
I say that. "respect for law is based
upon fear of the law?” If he Will not.
well and good; it he will, my only
answer is that it is human nature to
fear discomfort, particularly when in»
flicted by Society is a. Whole. There-
fore, our lawmakers, from Moses, Dr
Hammurabi down, have made it un—
comfortable for a man who has violat—
cd the laws of the community in which
he dwells. And they were right.
Organized Society could not endure,
except under those conditions.

May I sily right here [hilt I myself
have hacn before the Oracle. as Mr.
Kelly well knows, and that for tho cxe
[)l'e sion of an opinion in this column.
That surely was not A SQUARE
DEAL, and, it Mr. Kelly wishes to her
come personal and filllr about my
"fear" of the oracle, let me assure him
that any dust that flow into the

l

Oracle’s face at that time was not 1113']
dust, but the dust of those who were
interested in a SQUARE DEAL. Grant-
ed that my appearance before that
august body was not the will of the
Oracle as a whole, it merely adds
proof to the accusation that the Oraclei
is an irresponsible body, and subject
to the whims of its component parts.
That, by way of passing, so that the
public may know that I am not ignor-
ant whereof I speak,

Granted, that the Oracle commanded
the tear of the larger part of the 51117
dent body. it assuredly entertained no
respect. Our Courts would be now!
erless it their judgments were not held‘
in respect by Society, tor Society WlLl‘
connive in tho circolnlocution of the
Court's verdict, even as the Student
Body connived against the Oracle.

it is easy, dead easy, to face a secret
body. but no matter what punishment
it inflicts, there is always the solace,
”no one need know." But ‘it is haul,“
doucedly hard, to face a semi—open
court, and suffer under the THREAT
of being pointed out as a thief, a gam-
bler, or a drnnkard. And Therein lies
the ctfcctivancss of the court. When
FEAR and RESPECT for Society, and
not FEAR and CONTEMFT for a body
of twenty men, makes itself manifest
on our campus, then perhaps, a new
era of gentlemanly conduct will be in-
allgurated,

Richard Morrow Steiner, '24.
