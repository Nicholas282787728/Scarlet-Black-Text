PIONEERS IN FAIR SHAPE

'Watt’s Men Face Stiff Schedule
Against Veteran Teams;
Ames IS Strong.

A squad of \v ling cripples awaits
the Penn college battle Saturday
when the Pioneer team opens what
may prove to be one of the
hardest yet most successful seasons
Grinnell football has enjoyed, A long
scrimmage session Saturday against
Central cbllege which was followed by
a two—day rest and then two days
more of intensive drill were on Coach
Lester L. (Fuzz) Watt‘s preseason
drive for the opening game Saturday.

Either Central is particularly weak
this year or the local sonathowed
signs of being a successor to e team
which was near Valley champion two
seasons ago. The pass attack was ah
most invincible as the first four pass—
es tried were completed either for
long gains or touchdowns; the line
plunging was successful as Rose,
Douglas, and Lsidtke romped through
holes for five and ten yards at s time;
off tackle drives and end runs proved
to be good for scores and the defense
was for the most part strong enough
to toss Central hacks for losses.

Fail on llench

The team wllich began the Satur—
day's scrimmage found several veter-
ans on the sidelines because of injur—
ies and two or three of the promising
sophomores out of the lineup because
of wrenched knees, broken ribs and
similar disorders. Minier and Golz
were playing ends as Captain Fail
nursed a bad ankle on the bench.
Humphrey and Klinefelter were tack—
les; Parish and Norton, guards as
Bradford. promising lie pound sophoe
more, hobbled about on a wrenched
knee; Spencer was playing center.

The backfield included lllclntire and
Rose, veterans, at quarter andﬂullr
back; a pair of sophomores. Ruff and
Douglas, were at halfbacks. Richey.
freshman co-captain a year ago who
has been tearing up things this year,
wasn't even in uniform since he had
broken a rib earlier in the week,

Severnl Are Ineligible

If anything will stop the Pioneers
in their opening game, it will be in-
juries and ineligibility, Several lead
ing athletes must overcome scholastic
troubles in the next few days, Richey
must pass a chemistry examination
which he was unable to take because
of illness this spring; Bradley and
lliclntire both have special examlhhr
tions to take before they can enter
intercollegiate competition.

The whole squad is nursing accum-
lilated bruises. Norton, a bantnm
weight guard who seems to he a pos-
sible regular, is troubled with an in-
Jured hand; Letton, combination train-
er and guard, is hobbling on a sprain-
ed foot.

A tough schedule has been devised
for the local squad. A garlic against
the Quakers, who are sporting a yet-
eran eleven, is only a taste at what
must later be consumed. A game with
Kansas two weeks away brings the
Pionccrs in contact with another team
of twelve or fourteen letter men: (or

campus is beautiful too, with its huge
live oaks, green all the winter and
draped with veils of Spanish moss
that one sees everywhere in Florida.
But the buildings are old and inade-
quate, not to be compared for one
moment with ours at Crinnell. The
equipment all through, library and
laboratories and residences—tells the
same story of years of poverty and
perhaps, carelessness.

Yet it was this very povcrty and
and out look of Rollins, in such
curious contrast to its natural beauty,
that attracted Hamilton Holt more
when he became President, three
years ago. A well eqllippcd and well
established college would have not
appealed to him. He wanted one in
which he could start from the bottom,
lrce from all the barriers of tradie
iion and complacency. The very things
that would have repelled another
kind of a man seemed to him ideal
conditions for what he calls his "ads
venture in common sense education."
This adventure is still on the way.
Whether it will end in success or fail-
ure no one can yet tell. But at any
rate, Hamilton Holt has put Rollins
on the college map of the United
states, 'und up to the present his ex—
periment has been fully justified.
The “adventure" has two aspectsi
its idea, its method. The idea was
briefly this. Mr. I-Iolt was a graduate
of Yale. At Yale, he says, he learned

Tanager Critic Declares Essay 0h
Hardy and “Singing Words ”
Most Outsttinding.

By Joseph McKee

For a member of the editorial staff
to review the Tanager is like washing
one's family linen in public. Person-
ally one can understand the various
discrepancies but to explain them is
almost too much. Perhaps, if I seem
niuudlin, 1 may be excused. In criti-
cism one can only give personal opin—
ion and reaction to the article: Del-v
sonalities must be forgotten.

For myself, I think that Mr.
Payne's article on Thomas Hardy":
“Wessex" and Miss Atwoter's “Sing-
ing Words" are the outstanding pieces.
Harv has not been long dead but
books and nrticles are being written
about him in increasing number. My
acquaintance with Hardy is recent but
I feel that he would have liked what
Mr, Payne says about him and his
Wessex. Miss Atwater's poem em—
uloyes rather an old theme but the
treatment is different. I felt as if
she had rushed breathlessly to her
desk and wrote at white heat. Original
feeling, expertly caught, is far above
edited opinion.

Slmons‘ Article I’miseil

Miss Slmons’ "Way of the Smug-
gler" possesses the most charm of the
articles, She bandies no words. This
is .a delightfulrpiece to read when
everything else seems a bit drab. Clev.
er treatment, and expert selection are
everywhere in evidence

Miss Hunter's poem “The Reverend"
is a remarkable viginette it seems a
trifle too short, perhaps I was poetry
hungry when I read it.

"Timber Justice" by Robert Swift
is the story that won the Steiner prize
last spring. The perfection of tech-
nique is as good as more experienced
authors, hilt the instigation forces
seem too trivial. However, it makes
good reading.

Sandburg Contributes /

Carl Sandburg wrote, in reply to a
request for poems, that he would dig
down in his rag bag of poetry and
see what he could find for the Tana—
ger. He must have dug deeply to find
what he did, nevertheless we are bap-
py to have poems by Mr. Sandburg.
This poem will be included in his
forthcoming book of verse.

"Cowboy Joe” is well written bllt
I have read so many of the same genre
lately that my appetite is jaded.

The editorial deals with an impur»
tant subject and is done in an excel-
lcnt manner, a bit light but then edi-
torials should be read.

The book review department is
above par this time. Miss Simons is to
be congratulated upon her consistent
improvement and ceaseless work,

To freshmen who have this as their
first number. let me say that this is»
sue is average and that there are
many issues better, Aftcr ftll this mog~
azine is primarily a laboratory for
strident writings which ~ electrics out-
side contribution.

A reception was held last night by
President and Mrs. Main at their home
for all members of the faculty. The
faculty reception is an annual event
held at the President's home, where
the entire faculty may gather and the
new ones become acquainted with the
older ones. Refreshments were served
by Mrs. Main.

Survey of Eastern Institutions
Shows Return to Tidy Clothes

The university man, acknowledged
oracle in the world Of men's wear,
has returned to sanity in dress, ace
cording to surveys of three widely
separated educational institutions.

In the north, Yale University
selected as a typical university in a
“llliivlll'Sity town." In the south, Van-
dcrbilt was chosen, for thc sfllne rod-
son. And for a middle ground, Prince
tail was selected.

In all of these, observers found that
almost unanimously, the students had
reverted from thc“slouchy” college
tendency of recent yours, to a tidiue -
and care in dress that was surpris—
ing.

In all the colleges, the starched
Collar was found to be so nearly uni-

was

vex-Sal that it apeill's L0 constitute nlr
most it uniform. The comfarlable low,
pliant, starchod val "ties were most in
demand in both North and South.

Extreme cuts of trousers, absurd
shirt, cullal‘ and tie combinations and
ether freakish effects have disappears
ell.

Tlic college man, according to one
student, realizes that he is a potential
ungc corner, and that he 15 judged
by his habits in clothes as well as
in his other practices. He is not at—

eds or to his future employer in silr

That is why he has decided to wear

Unity of Life and the Meaning of
Idedls Is As Important As
\Ledrning A Vocation.

WELCOMES BACK STUDENTS

Suggests Trial and Error Method
While In College And Let
Concentration Wait.

"We are not here merely to achieve
joy or u vocation but to get a con-
ception of the unity of nature and of
the meaning and ideals of life,” Presi-
dent J. H. T. Main told Grinnell stu—
dents at the opening chapel service
Wednesday morning in Herrick cha—
pel.

“If education is to mean more than
bread and butter three times a day
we must learn here something of the
unity of life and of the creative and
saving power of the ideal," he said.

Discusses Difficult Subjects

These statements were amplified by
a discussion of the purposes one lath.
cr had in insisting that his son should
study Creek. Because Greek was
hard, the boy didn’t like it, and be
cause it was of no use anyway, the
parent insisted that his son enroll
for the course. President Main de—
clared that any subject should be
"hard enough to test, try, and prove
your soul. Don-t refuse a subject be—
cause you think it is hard."

Few college students know whether
they like a subject or not, and it is
best to postpone decision as am a life
vocation, he said, "We are here pri-
marily, after all, to study ourselves
a hit,” he explained. ”Interests are
sometimes native and don't change.
but ‘more often they are acquired
testes, such aS that for green olives
or corned beef and cabbage. We should
use the laboratory method of trial and
error while We are here. We can
concentrate when the time comes for
concentration."

Discussing the father's statement
that Greek didn't amount to any-
thing anyhow, President Main said
“the father ran amuck when he made
that statement. For twenty-four cen—
turies the Greek people have been
contributing thought processes and
exerting a controlling influence in the
great movement of the world. ﬁlter.
ature. art, philosophy, mathematics,
science, and religion all give evidence
of the Creek contribution, Even tho
Crinnell post office has a suggestion
of Greek. I am not speaking for
Greek alone, but for the great cur—
rents of thought that stand for the
kingdom of beauty, truth and right~
eousness."

The moral wrong of submitting to a
mere bread and butter education was
pointed out by President Main. "You
may think that your tuition has paid
the price of your education bllt it has
paid only the mere running expenses
of this year, For the ideals and 1110114
ey that have converged to make this
college we have paid nothing. They
are a free gift from the past, and from
the men and women once young who
are now following out their ideals.

“I believe in leisure the joy of liv-
ing, but there must be a reach for
solnethiug that glorifies lite, else life
is not worth living. There'll be struga
glc, joy, and tears, success, disap<
pcintmcnt, despair and wonder. ’But
I beg yoll to follow the ideal, the
gleam, and fight it through."

Fourteen hilllflball courts will be
available to University of Kansas Stu-
dents this year. Nine of the cont-ts
will be out of doors while five will
be indoors.
