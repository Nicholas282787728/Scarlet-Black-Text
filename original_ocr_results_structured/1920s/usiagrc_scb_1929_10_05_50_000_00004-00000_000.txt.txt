D. A. R. Hears
Baumann Talk

Constitution is Not to Be
Thought of As
Super-human.

“Too often the constitu—
tion is not taken for what
it is — a great record of human
achievementibut it is made a kind
of superhuman symbol." said Prof.
Frederick L. Baumann of the history
department in addressing the Grin-
nell chapter of the Daughters of the
American Revolution on “The Living
Constitution" Dr. Baumann mai —
tained that to regard the constitu»
tion as a fetish is to obscure its dis-
tinctive and enduring qualities.

“Recently," he said, "there has
arisen a cult, a worship, of the Con-
stitution of the United States. In
some vague. undefinable way, many
honest and good people feel that
anyone who dares to criticize — or
even examine too closely—a single
line or aspect of that instrument of
government is a traitor. It is a per
fectly honest feeling, arising from
creditable patriotic motives, and its
strength and fervor are easily ex-
plainable.

“In truth, however. the constitu-
tion is a growing organism that per-
allels a constantly growing and
changing society. Rules themselves
can never he a government. The
changeless principles upon which we'
must build are in the same place
that they were in 1787, and that is
not on a piece of paper. The real
Constitution is, and will he preserv-
ed, just where it was writteninot on
paper but in the hearts and lives of
American citizens."

Dorms Practice
for Speedballi

(Continued from Page 1). __
fensive players of the league last
year, both being fast and having lots
of fight. I-lipp was probably the
best guard which last year's com-
petition developed. possessing the
ability to take the ball away from
an opponent and send it far down the I
ﬁeld with a kick. DeLong, Graeher
and Wolfe all starred with their re-,
spective teams.

Interest this year, as usual, will
center in the attempt of some team
to wrest the title away from Dibble:
hall, which has never lost a game of
speedball since its inception as an in-
tramural sport here. Langan al-
rnost turned the trick last fall, being
within an ace of defeating the Dibble
aggregation. but ﬁnally lost in the
last quarter of the game, the ﬁnal
score being 11-9. Prospects this
year again indicate that Dibble and
Langan will meet in the final round,

A meeting of all officials and cap-
tains of building teams in speedball
was held in the clubroom of Building
Four last Thursday evening for the
purpose of discussing new rulings
and making certain agreements in
relation to conditions of playing
here at Grinnell this season. Several
old controversies were cleared up
on da few definite rules were laid.

Steiner Will Speak

to Cosmopolitans

Dr. E. A. Steiner will address the
first open meeting of the Cosmopol-
itan club in the Y building Tuesday
evening at 7:15. John Eiscn announ-
ced Tuesday. The club invites to
the meeting all students and faculty
interested in internationalism.

The announcement was made by
the president at the Cosmopolitan
club's first meeting this fall, held
as a picnic at Merrill park, intro-
ducing Ricardo Castero of the Phil-
ippine Islands as a new member.
John Tatom, although not present at
the picnic, will he another Philippine
addition.

The appointment of the executive
committee of three officers was made
public. Reba Jordan has been re~
appointed social chairman; Richard
Sneed will take the place of Fermin
Carino as treasurer; and Alfred Con-
ard succeeds Gretchen MacArthur
as chapter editor.

Eisen also called attention to the
fact that the regular time of meeting
has been shifted to the first and
third Tuesdays of each month, put-
ting the next business session on
Tuesday the fifteenth.

New Substitution Method
Not to Be Used at Ames

The new system of having football
substitutes report to the sidelines in-
stead cf the referee, which proved
successful last Saturday in the Penn
struggle, will not he used at Ames
today, but will be tried again at one
of the home games. If the new sys-
tem proves as effective as expected.
it will become a regular feature of
Grinnell contests.

The idea is a new one in football
but is common in basketball. The
substitute, having reported to the
sidelines, enters into the game on
the next play without having to re-
port to the referee. The advantages
of this system arerespecially obvious
at this time of the year, when Lhe
lineup is not defintely settled and
many substitutions are made.

Post Office Gives Caution
on Laundry Bag Contents

Upon investigation at the postof-
ﬁce. it has been found that any writ-
ten matter enclosed in laundry bags,
will be rated the same as ﬁrsteclass
mail, and should he posted the same.
It had been reported that several
students were having trouble secur-
ing their bags. owing to the fact that

ond-class mail, will be rated accord-
ingly. Students are warned in order
