THE GRINNELL SCARLET ND BLACK

 

Tebbens Replaces
Smiley on Annual

With Bernard Tebbens taking the
position of business manager of the
Cyclone in place of Dwight Smiley,
who is not coming back to school be-
cause or poor health, both the editor
ial and business ends or the yearbook
are getting under Way.

The opening pages will portray the
history of Grinnell college from the
time the Indians roamed the Iowa
plains, through to the historic cye
clone and on up to the present build—
ings and the plans for the future,
Each picture will cover two pages
and will be printed in attractive
colors. Both me double spread idea
and the pioneer theme are something
different in college annuals.

Since Crinnell is the oldest college
west of the Mississippi and since this
is the seventy-fifty anniversary or
the founding of Grinnell city, the pio-
neer theme is especially appropriate
at this time. The idea will be carried
throughout the division pages, but in
a modernized form. Drawings rcr
these will be made by Jean Busby,
the art editor.
