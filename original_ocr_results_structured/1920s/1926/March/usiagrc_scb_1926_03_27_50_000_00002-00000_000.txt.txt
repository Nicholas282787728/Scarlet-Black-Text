THE FUTURE OF GRLNNELL.

It is no idle dream to predict that within the near
future one of the colleges in the Middle West is to assume
a prestige not merely in local but in national leadership,
comparable to that which has so long been monopolized
by the venerable institutions of New England. This is
Giinnell's destiny, and we Grinuell men believe it can be
proved by the facts brought out during the past week
Those older colleges bad

mosscovered antiquities when Grinnell

that: makes for real leadership Grinnell has grown faster
in ﬁfty years than some of the older ones in two hundred
and ﬁfty.

In spite Of the tremendous and almost overwhelming
popularity nf the great state universities throughout the
west a college which has real character will never lose
its prestige. Cnmpelled by law to admit practically
everyone who comes, the universities have found no
answer [(7 the problem of governing and educating SEV-
era! thousand young people suddenly released from the
influence of home and community. Wholesale instruCr
lion has it place in the world. It is better than no
instruction at (Ill, and it is better than instruction by mail.

But it is not college education.

The students and graduates who are joining in the
movement to develop Grinnell as a, men-s college know
that Grinuell has everything that is essential to make it
the strongest, the ﬁnest, and the most respected of any
college west of New England. There is nothing flashy
in this undertaking. It is not an attempt to lift the
college by its own bootstraps, There is no parading of
the big bass drum. Grinnell duesn’t need that sort of
thing. All it needs is to have its students and friends
interpret it to the intelligent people of any community.
It is up to each one of us to interpret Grinnell to his own
community thoroughly, parsistently, and intelligently. If
we do that the results will take care at themselves.

THE EXCEPTIONAL STUDENT AND “ACTIVITIES"

There are dissipations and dissipations in the life of
the college student. but perhaps the most pathetic is
. the dissipation of the abilities of the exceptional
individual in a maze of petty hut engrossing undergl‘adur
ate activities . . . .

He becomes a member of half a dozen clubs and
societies, he connects himself with the better organiza-
tions. he plunges into the undergraduate swirl, not neces-
sarily because he is imbued with the desire to be a
social lion, but because he feels it his duty to appear and
to be seen about. He develops poise. ease. grace. He
can engage in conversation with professor or chaperone
without embarrassment to himself or to these append-
ages of his education. He carries out well enough what-
ever is intrusted to him, but he never does so with
distinction or with more than a flash of ability.

In other words. he develops a facile cleverness so
that‘ he does everything well but nothing thoroughly.
And. worst of all, this is markedly true of his classroom

warlr. He turns in at the end of his university career

THE YOUTH MOVEMENT FOR PEACE

While only a surpri 'ngly small number or students
were present at the joint meeting of the Y. .‘l. and Y. \V.
last week, those who did attend received food {or
thought which will sustain them for some time to come.
Legion who took active part in the World War, spoke
Mr. Harrison, as it soldier and member of the American
from personal observation and experience of war events
and war methods. He had, moreover, an earnest mes-
sage to present to young people, and he gave them a
viewpoint which they had seldom, if ever discovered be-

fore.

“'hsther or not one personally agrees with all of MI.
Harrison's beliefs, one cannot do better than 'm reflect
on them as an invigorating and stimulating presentation
or a point of view very far removed from that with
which we have commonly been educated to regard War
matters. I! We are to learn any lesson from the horrors
of die last war we must impartially review what are
found to be the l‘ucts of the case, not simply considering
what we as Americans have been accustomed to believ-
ing, and then judge for ourselves What is right and What
is wrong. Mr. Harrison presents the Revisionist view-
point—that the guilt of war rests not alone upon Ger-
many, as is popularly supposed, but “pull it group of nlilr
itztrlsts in each of the countries involved. He says that
he entered the war as a volunteer. fully believing that
he was defending the sanctity of womanhood and was
helping to make the World safe for demncrzlcy, but that
from his experience he has come to believe that \rzu' 1n-
evitehly brings zl. lowering of standards morally. spin v
belly, and politically. He tells of personal conversations
with German soldiers, and with young penple in England,
France, Japan. and China, [but bring us to a. realization
that We are bound, in seine inevitable way, to the. youth
of other nations who are looking to America in the spirit
of friendliness and brotherhood. All those are new ideas,
new experiences, which are eminently worthy of the
consideration of broad-minded young men and women.

No one really wants war, but because we have for
centuries been educated to the belief that war is inevitar

ble. we have come to accept it without any really su-‘the
l

preme effort toward its prevention, In every war that
has been taught it has been the innocent, and not the
guilty. who have suffered. The mllitarists who bring
about wars do not fight them and are not punished for
them. Always it has been the innocent, peace-loving ma-

jnrity who have been swept into the conflict to Darling|

there was no other way. Mr. Harrison believes that
penalty with lifeblood —— simply because they believed
thereyis another way, and that it lies in developing the
power of public opinion so strongly against war that it

will automatically become an impossibility. If the pub-

lic can be educated to believe in peace as thoroughly asytianity.“

it now believes in war, the problem will be solved.

To bring about this solution, it is naturally on the
youth of the nations that the responsibility falls, and to
educate the youth of the world to meet this responsibility
is the purpose of the Fellowship of Youth for Peace.
Grinnellisns should not shun their responsibility of a
serious and thoughtful consideration of this great prob-
lem which is dominating world thought today. cud which
impel'atively demands not only consideration, but action
as well.
