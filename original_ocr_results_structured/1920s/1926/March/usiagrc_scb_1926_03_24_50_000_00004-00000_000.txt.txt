, ccomes an unusually
important person on this pilutless
ship. Though perhaps just a bit
"stagey" in his manner, ilr. Hall
mode a good character. To enter the
action late and leave it early and still
to give the impression of having done
an important hit of acting, is the
good fortune of James Work who ap-
peared as the engaging examinel'ram-
hassador from the Almighty. His
lighting up of his pipe and ill-s, Clive-
den Bank's asking whether he plays
golf are most excellent strokes.

Space lacks for a criticism or the,
play as such, but the writer cannot
help feeling that it would he much bet-
ter as done ac't plity thanit is in three
acts. It is fundamentally a study of
a single situation and lacks anything
like a proper action. All the complie
cation has preceded the rise of the
curtain an the voyagers are, as Tom
says, "trapped!“ After a reehle effort
at extrication, the resolution has to he
effected by the interference of an out-
slde force in the nature of a deus ex
machina. in short it is not dramatic.
There is no central character or char-
acters at the center of interest, unless
it be 'the suicide lovers; out these in-
stead of asserting themselves as they
should in order to carry the attention
of the audience, are of all the charac-
tcrs, the most helpless and passive
until the very last scene, which seems
like an after thought, inasmuch as
there is no real reason why thy should
not be judged with the rest. To have
achieved an importantant stage suc—
cess notwithstanding these defects of
structure, speaks unusually well for

.the players and the producing staff

directed by William Angus.
