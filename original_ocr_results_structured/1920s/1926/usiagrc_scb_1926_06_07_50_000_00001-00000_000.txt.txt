By Paul Spencer Wood

"Cyrano de Bergerac," the Senior
Class play, was performed by the Drag
lllatic club Saturday evening before Ii
Commencelllent audience which ﬁlled
the Colonial theatre,

The play is one that admits no
mean between triumph and failure.
Romantic exaggeration. romantic syn
thesis of contradictions, romantically
impossible exploits, and the spirit of
the gasconade personiﬁed, 7 these
things are ridiculous if they are not
accepted as sublime. College (indie
ences are not generally appreciative
of romantic excess. Yet Cyrano, who
puts a hundred men to ﬂight with his
unassisted blade, who wins a battle
single—handed, Cyrano, the perfect
lover Whose life is one long despair
and whose death is a bit of theatrical
devotion won his audience completely.

Lest the critic be classed as a more
representative of “the 'Victrola. audi-
ence," he will not indulge his natural
inclinations to praise the performance
without restraint. Warned that “there
are many things which an honest
critic ought to do which he had better
not," he will speak of the performance
fat least that of the title roleiivitll
tempered enthusiasm.

Billinrz Hits Zest.

Mr. Emil liilharz, .with his hlond
locks covered by a dark wig and his
handsome face disﬁgured by a gigantic
false nose, played the part of Cyrano
with distinction unusual in amateur
acting. He playel with zest, yet with
restraint and touch of Gallic humor.
He was effective throughout but was
especially so in the balcony scene in
the third act. “Cyrano de Bergerac"
has one star part. At the risk of
running counter to the severe staudr
ards of Mr. Bilharz, the dramatic critic
it may be said that Mr. Bilharz, the
stellar, played that star part with emi-
nent success.

Miss Ruth Somers closed a brilliant
carrer in Grinnell College dramatics
by her portrayal of the heroine, Rox-
anus. She was charming and caps
able as usual.

twenty dollar gold piece, with the [ole

"The Quadrangle girls have been
thinking that you have not yet receiv-
ed enough reward for your twenty
years of service in Grinnell, and how
that we have heard you tell of those
years we are sure of it. So we are gor
ing to give you a dollar for each of
the twenty years, for it is a well-

We know you will spend it wisely.
and we hope you will think of us then.

of importance.

and

Grinnell has enjoyed unusual suc—
cess in its activities program the past
year, The program has been extensive
and Well rounded; athletics, forensics.
dramatic: and sonolnstics have found
important places.

The football season was successful.
The season opened with a game with
Penn which was easily won by the
Pioneers and the reserves. The Sec-
end game resulted in a tie with Cor-
nell. The third was played with the
University of Minnesota; Grinnell lost
but returned with honors as the best
team the University had met. The
homecoming game Was lost to Drake
after the Bulldogs had been forced to
seek their safety zone three times.
Oklahoma A. 5:. M. was beaten 28 to 0.
At the Ames homecoming, Grinnelltied
the Cyclones by forcing them to con~
cede two points from the safety zone.
The Thanksgiving game was lost to
Washington university at S‘t. Louis.
The success of team was largely due
to the coaching of Mike Hyland and
Charles Black. Martin and Meeter
were placed on the all—conference
teams by leading sport writers in ‘the
Valley. Porter Martin will captain
the Pioneers DEXt year and Mike Hy-
land will return as coach.

hair Basketball Season

The basketball season was a fail—
ure for those who seek the big end of
scores but it was very successful in
that Charlie Black uncovered some
new material which will be of value
on 'the next year’s squad.

Rinefort, the super weightman of
the Valley, was the outstanding star
of the Pioneer track team and with an.
other year of competition, he will
prove an invaluable part of the team,
Captain Schamweher was handicaps
ped most of the season by or pulled
tendon but placed in every meet in
which he competed. Meeter special—
ized in the discus and was an almost
sure point winner in that ei'Ent. Laird
was a ’find and his sensational toss of
the javelin iu the Drake dual, showed
that he was to be reckoned with in
future meets. Woodrulf proved that
persisteucy would find its reward by
wining his Honol- “G" in his senior
year after trying throughout his col-
lege Career to Win the two mile grind.

The only poignant remembrance of
the past season is that “Doc" Huff.
truck Coach par excellence and “does
tor of friendship," is leaving his alum.
nluter to coach at Kansas.

The intramural CrosSrCDuntry was
won by Smith ball. Dibble hall won
the inter-dormitory basketball cup,
Building three the baseball trophy and
Dibble took the cups for speedball and
tennis. Nicolet won the handball
tournament after a. hard battle with
Lovcioy.

Good 'l'eullis Results

Due to the playing of Nicolet find
Sti‘ullle, Gl‘inncll finished third in the
Valley tennis meet. stotts, Loveioy
and Smiley made their letters in tenr
nis and Will be available for val ity
next year.

The freshman lmsl-(eteers won the
interclass tournament in easy fashion.

The Gl‘illnell Forensic was estab-
lished soon after tllc literary societies
were disbanded, With James Work
Its president, this organization foster—
ed the men’s meetings and ‘the Merrill
debate which was won by Building
four. Debating stock at Grinnell look
a. decided rise and more than thirteen
hundred people attended the fourteen
debates held on the campus.

li'itll Clark and Langan llnlls
in Following rlocc.

During the past year intramural
athletics has been reorganized on a
definite basis and has held an import-
ant place on the program for men. A
point system, covering the year's pro-
gram, was worked out and put into efe
feet. lob points were awarded on the
percentage basis so that if a team
won only one contest in a series points
were received for the game won. 25
points were awarded to each hell out
ering a lull team in each scheduled
contest. For scholarship, points were
figured according to the number of
grade points which the various halls
averaged throughout the year, 100
points being given to the highest and
the others iigmring on a percentage
basis,

Scholarship was a new feature this
year. it is interesting to note that
Dibble hall, winner of the all-year
trophy, placed second highest in
scholarship. This record is noteworthy
as Dibble has more men than any oth-
er hall.

rottlc Gives Trophy

Loving cups were given to the \vin~
ners of each sport and for the hall
maintaining the highest scholastic
average. Ed Pottle, a Grinnell gradu—
ate, donated the large all-year trophy.
This is a traveling traphy and is
known as the Pottle intramural
Trophy.

The success of tile Intramural pro-
gram cannot be denied if one is to
study the results of the year's pro-
gram. practically all
were closely contested and a. splendid
display of sportsmanship prevailed
throughout 'the year. The slogan of
the athletic department has been
"sports for all" and it has been more
nearly realized this year than ever be-
fore. New sports have been added
and it is only the lack of the physical
equipment that will keep the program
from enlarging further in the future.
If the proposed swimming pool be-
comes a reality, aquatic sports will be
added next year.

“Persephone” Pageant
To Be Given Tonight

“Persephone," the charming and
colorful pageant which was presented
so artistically several weeks ago by
the pupils of Miss Clara .1. Anderson,
will be repeated this evening at 8:30
on the campus in front of the women’s
gymnasium. The pageant is an ftddpk
dtion from the old Greek myth “Persev
phone and Demeter and consists of
four scenes with a s iking and beans
liful finale.

The principal parts will be portray»
ed by Adele Schwarz as Persephone,
Agnes Krarup as Demeter, Ru‘th Soul-
ers as Pluto, Lois Wilson as Hermes,
hiuriel Rutcliif as the Last Rose, and
Ruth Gordon, as Pan.

The lighting of the entire pro-
duction is unusually well handled and
the blending of the pastel costumes
with the foliage produces a charming
effect, which makcs the pageant one
of the most distinctive and beautiful
of recent yeul .

Conch llylluul to 11.1“: Nine Letter
Mon As Nucleus For Team
Next Season.

With the return of nine letter men to
the Scarlet and Black pigskin squad
next fall, Coach Mark Hylund will
have a. fitting nucleus around which to
arrange a great grid machine. Cap-
tain Porter Martin, All-Valley tackle
selection of last fall, will lead the
Pioneers against the strongest schedr
ule of toes that a. Glinnell team has
ever faced.

six men were lost by graduation or
others means for next year, but the
gaps left by these men seem to be well
taken care of by reserve and prep ma-
terial from this year’s squad. Sweet,
captain, Moyer, Catbcart, Scharuweb-
er, Howarth, Moran, and Wing, are
those affected by rulings of one kind
or another. do almost equally great
bunch of ball toters will step into the
shoes of these men next fall.

Good Ends Buck

With McClain and Niblo at ends,
the Pioneers should have little fear of
end-skirting by opposing ball carriers.
These two men showed enough in ev-
ery game 0! the season to mark them
as wing men of great class. McClain
and Nihlct were both bothered with lnr
juries during the past season. Parks
is another candidate for end who will‘
get plenty of consideration from the
coaching force. Him is a. hard Work-
ing, hard hitting end who knows how
to play his position in a smart man-
ner. Rose played end and guard on
several occasions and showed up well.

At the tackles will be two of the
greatest line men that Grinnell has
ever had. Martin was selected as All-
Valley tackle last year, and also All-
State, Martin will lead the team next
year, and as all indications point
should have the greatest year of his
competition. Davis at the other tackle
post is a rangy, hard fighting line
man. Starring in every game, “Soli-
ny” placed himself high in the estima—
tion of all the prominent football
authorities in the west.

seclaud Good Guitl'll

A powerful lineman from the FIOT
neel' squad of last year, Scelztlld, will
fill one of tbc guard positions, He is
exceedingly last and clever for at his
man.

The only vol-city lc'ttcr man who
will try out for center will be Petelu
son, regular center of two years ago,
and a part time man last year at both
Center and guard. "Bull" is a strong
man who chn administer a lot of pun-
isltmen‘t tu opponents who are not
careful in handling themselves,
"Bull’s" gilt doom is one of the land-
marks in Pionccr football.

In the lntckficld, Mcotcr at half, and
Sinus at quarter, are the only letter—
mcn. blectcr was an almost unani-
lneus selection for Alerztllcy and All»
State lcams last fall, and it looks as
though on even greater season Call be
anticipated next year from “nutcer
Stotts is a two letter winner, who fill-
an the slides of quarterback in a very
callable manner. West Was a vel‘)’
clever bell tater, and the chances are
that Coach H 'lﬂlld will shift him to a
half, to make room for one of several
soot! quarterback candidates.
