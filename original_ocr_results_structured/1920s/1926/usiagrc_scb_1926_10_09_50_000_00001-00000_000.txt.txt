leading feature of the first issue of the
Tanager, it was announced today. In
this article, Miss Suckow, author or

the kind being written today, Miss
Suckow says that “they are more valu-
able gifts than wreaths laid with cere-
mony upon the grave of the unknown
soldier. They show that he has
touched not only the quickly shitting
emotions or his time, but that he has
at last been taken into the minds oi
the people and has received their sober
consideration in thought.

tributed zit Homecoming, will lead Off
