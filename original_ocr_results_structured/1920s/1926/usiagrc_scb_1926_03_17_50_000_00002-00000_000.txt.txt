LIMITATION OF UAMJ’US AGTIVI 115..

Oliver Wendell Holmes said two mouthfuls when he
declared that “the greatest thing in the world is not so
much where we stand as in‘ what direction we are mow
ing,” In this age of progress when the newest machinery
becomes antiquated over night; when law bccomcs more
technical and intricate each second, the Aeml‘ican college
is confronted with an enormous task. in attempting to

adapt itself to the changing conditions.

The Grinneli student council is to be commended for
the interest with which that body has assisted in the
adjustment or student chairs in the past and with which
that organization is functioning today.

One of the latest and most interesting moves of the
student council is the investigation of the ”limit’ttion of
extra-curricular activities" plan which is meeting with
considerable favor a several eastern and midrwestern col-
leges.

Fur sometime leading educators have claimed that
English students go to college to become educated while
the Americans seem to go to moire an athieitc team, the
stat! of some publication, the mlslcal orgnnizntions cud
the like. Americans apparently are laboring under the
impression that the college plan's popularity and‘proml-
hence is directly proportional to the number of activities
in which he is engaged.

Alter all, twontyufonr hours n day is rather short for
any student to earn his way through college, play on an
athletic team, sing in the glee club. edit a. publication and
take (in active part in several other campus organizations.
Either the studies or the activities must surfer. conse-
quently‘, unless the studies are neglected to c certain
extent, the student organizations must be conducted on e
less clficient basis.

it is foolish to believe that on the Grinnell campus
trere are but a few students who possess the talents
and qualities or leaders. There are mnny students who
could conduct oifices now controlled by a limited num—
ber of Campus leaders, cud pcrbops in d more cliicicnt
manner. it isn't such a, hard task for a few campus
leaders to buffalo the student body into believing that
they are the only geniuses in college.

The Exti‘orCuri'lculum Unit plan is probably the best
limitation scheme that has been devised so for. By this
method, activities and organizations are classiﬁed rind
an estimate of the time required for members, cfliccrs
and the amount of time (or work are all nverngcd. Thc
ertra»cul'i'icululn unit corresponds to the credit hour,
and by such n unit is measured the time required ‘loi-
outside activities and for studies.

The system should have two outstanding favorzible
effects: ﬁrst, it should make campus activities more
elficient by allowing a greater number of studetus to

second, it should give moi-c students at chliilce to show .

bond. The inrcstigntion should determine the advlsr‘

is that the student Council Isn't aslccp,

CRITICISM

There is abroad in all countries today a tendency to
employ a primarily constructive function, criticism, in a
purely destructive fashion. Augmented by components
or the age or science and commerce, such as wide use
of the press, free speech lurtiicr extended by use or the
radio and closer uniﬁes hf people, destructive criticism,
that which scclss to kill rather than progress, is settling
like a. malevolent, prolific germ in the minds of men.

Even here on a typical college campus its fruits are
evident. Instead of cultivating the {air and open mind,
many people are duped into believing that this means
carrying a fundamental prejudice against student acllvV
ities, visitors, etc. The result is marked non-support,
unfounded loose talk, and a. sect of chronic kickers. We
do not believe in unqualififed agreement with all things
said or done; we hold, however} that a. much more
wholesome and satisfactory spirit will be obtained with
the elimination of this prevalent spirit of mal-conteu‘i
and substitution of the open mind.

‘Not confined to the college campus, destructive crit-
icism lives in opulence in American life in general. We
might point to the political campaigns of our states and

ordinary account or an event, often a paper will siczc
upon some choice bit of scandal or gossipy news, which
more often than otherwise poitrays at most a halfrtl'ulh. l
People seem to date in just that thing. They are blinded
to the truth; they coci-cc hasty and iinwzirrllntetl conclu-
sions, and destroy logic.

This is one extreme, and as such we condemn it.
There is. of course, the other extreme, namelyilhough‘t-
less pftssiveness and slip—shod indifference. This We
lihcwisc deplore. We favor the critical attitude or mind
in the sense that it is analytical and constructive. But
the present tendency toward a. rut of cynical dcspondency,
we feel, calls for ndjusment.

We arc the young intellectuals.

We possess the grey hairs at youth.

We mouth halfwtrilths learncdly and when called to

We scoff at religion as superstition; ct forth as a sign

We criticize that we may seem to be ethove_ criticism.

We are pseudo-radicnls, pselltlorphilosophers, and
pseudo-Cynics; our logic is faulty end our premises
unsound.

We bask in the cold light of a very impure reasoning.

We abhor advice, for the burnt child shuns the ﬁre
only after he has placed his hand in the ilome.

We are egotists; We are misnnthropists; we are
sophists.

We dress platitudes in caster: garments sud call
