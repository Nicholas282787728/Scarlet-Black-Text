Personal Glimpses Of

The Ploneers Of 1926

The Pioneers will be represented by
a team composed almost entirely of
.veiems when ’they start their sche-
time of Valley games today against
Ames. Grime“ will have two men
who ended the 1925 season as mem—
bers of the allrstate and Missouri Vai-
ley teams. Besides these two men are
several others at the same caliber who
in the past years have subordinated
‘their ability to star in order that Grin»
nell might have a. team Which would
work with precision. -
Captain Marlin, Tackle
Captain ital-tin made both the Mis-
souri Valley and all-state mythical
teams of last year. This year he has
been handicapped by minor injuries
but showed. some of his old form
against’mrquette last Saturday when
he recovered a blocked Mamuette punt
for Grillell, scoring a touchdown. He
is a big husky man, inst ml his feet
and does notihesitate to crack through
the Wing line to down \‘t‘uuld-he

garden Hooter also made both the

' all-43ml: and Missouri Valley teams

last year. He is a. well-built half who

can [gas and kick as well as drive

through the line for good gains. ori

defense, leeter plays an important

role. He is fast enough to break up

passes and can analyze plays fast

enougl to make a dependable safety
man. “

Smm,ﬂalfbuck.

West Knits will not be able in play
in the Arms game. . stuns, like Meet~
er, reclaim bis peak of achievement
when he is in a pinch. To date, he
is my: scorer in the Valley with as

sustained in the Simpson game. He
will probably be in shape to start with
the ﬁrmer; again within the next
two wan.

 

Limb, Fulliluck.
Lamb, playing fullback, is a big
husky man who likes to play the
game. On defense he backs “1) the
Ibrward wall very effectively and on
offense he is goud for many gains.
Lamb has had football experience at
Carnegie Tech, but before this year
has not been allle to get guing again.
At present he seems to be buck into
form. He is an excellent passer, grips
the lyall with a big hand and whips it
to the )‘OEGiVEl‘ with speed and aceu
cy.
McClain, Qullrturbllcii.
McClain plays defensive end and (lb
[ensive quarter, and generally directs
the team. Under his ﬂil‘ectiuu the
Griunell men marched to a touchdown
in the ﬁrst five minutes of Flay
against Marquette, "Mac” isn’t so big
but he works on the rule that the
bigger they are tile llardcl‘ tile iall,
and his speed in getting into the play
has wrecked many opposing offen-
sives. At present he is hampered by
a bad knee.
McLain, Hull‘lmck.
hchaih, playing a half, played for
Grinnell fullr years ago. Since that
time he has been out of school. This
year he is eligible and has been
making a name for himself as a punt
er. In practice he averages over 50
yards. _
Emmi, Quarterback /
Evahn. who has been ineligible, is
again with the Pioneers. He has not
played any varsiiy ball this year but
his Work on the freshman squad and
on the varsity last year is enough to
show that he is fast on his feet, a good
passer, and a good defensive man
Nlblo,- End. l
Niblo, playing end, is a big rangy
man who is fast enough to get down
on punts and big enough to smear any
attempted thrusts at the Grinneii end.
He is n. gnarl tackler and a gnarl pass
receiver. He has had a year's experi-
‘ehce and can play hiaporition against

a hall position and has shown promis—
iug ability to break up passing attacks
and to get into many iille plays. Last
year he was not eligible, so he lost a
y'ear's experience, but lie knows his
game and is aggressive enough to
show the imposition that he does.
Rollertsml, End.

Robertson is more or less the Sur-
prise of the year. He weighs 50
pounds less than Itinelbri but he bale
l‘els into the big boys without any dis-
crimillation. in playing the end Do~
sition he smears interference when—
ever it comes his way. He is a, little
slow" on gctting down on nun‘ts but
with Niblo as a running mate it is .1
good receiver that can elude the Grill—
ncll end.

, Wei , 'l‘ucklc.’

We a is a big, hcely boy with plan»
ly of light and stubbornness who has
been holding (lawn a tackle position.
In the Simpson grunc his man was an
all-state tackle of 1925 but Weitz took
care of him very nicely. Weiiz has
had very little varsrty experience out-
side of the playing which he has done
this year.

 

lluvis, Tackle.

Dllvis is holding down ‘tlle other
tackle. Last year "Sunny" was a very
valuable man. He has played a very
Consistent game thisyear and is one
of the mlleanding fighters in the line.
His shifty style of play keeps the op-
Dosi’tiun guessing.

Seclund, Guard.

Seclcnd, playing a guard, is also a
veteran of last year, He gets into ev»
ery play and gets his man out o! the
way when the play goes over him.
This year Dick has been intercepting
a few passes. He is a rangy man cl
about 185 pounds and makss himself
generally useful whenever he is on the
’lleld. .

alcluud, Guard.

Clclcnd has been playing the other
guard position. He is one of the new
men who have shown up very well
this year. He is tough and hard to
hurt. _

Yetersou, Center.

Ted Peterson, “Bull Montana," is the
strongest man on the line and holds
down the center position. He is the
lightest man in the line but his
strength and courage make up [or this
lack in weight Last year he played
many games and this experience set-
tled him down. At present he is
slightly hampered by a sore ankle.
His passes are last and true, and have
been quite accurate so iar this Season.

Spencer has had some experience at
center and tackle this year.

damage. At center he has made a.

Turks, Guard.

Parks is giving eleland a good but-
tie for left guard, He is a heady play-
er and although he is a trifle light,
can hold down a guard position nicely.
Parks has had little Varsity experience
but has taken advantage of the coaclr
ing for two years and as 0. result he
knows the game,

Wolfe, Quarter.

Wolfe, who has had experience at
quarter, is fast and heady. The fact
that he is light has kept him out of
the lineup most 01' the time this year.
At present he is a dark horse as a cog
in the Grinncil machine.

' Dukc, Hilli'back.

Almtner newcomer to the squad this
season is Don Duke, younger brother
