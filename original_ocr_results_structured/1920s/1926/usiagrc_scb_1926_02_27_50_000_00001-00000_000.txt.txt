David Peck gives his own oriicial
ranking of the clubs as Illinois. f st;
Michigan. second. and Grinnell. third.
He placed Grinnell and Michigan in
practically a tie but gave the “’clvere
ines a slight edge. Several persons
who heard the contest expressed sur-
DrisC that the Iowa university club
was ranked third. ‘

Plcltei'nell’s leter to David Peck is
as follows:

“Dear Peck: I know how disap-
pointed you were in the outcome cf
last night, and I am sending this
letter to express a personal regret
that your club did not place higher.

“According to my personal score.
Grinnell won the contest. which
goes to show how necessary it is
to have the average of three men's
opinions rather than the opinion of
one. Apparently the judges picked
faults in your production winch
went over my head. Anyway, I
think you have a beantilul club and
I know that the competition is

Folletf to Al'g'uc Here March 6.

With only one week remaining until
their encounter with Eeloit here on
March (i. the freshmen debaters are
rapidly developing their arguments in
preparation for the contest.

The team. chosen from a group of
seven or eight ti-youtcrs. is composed
of Mack Swigel-t oi Des Memes, Elton
Follett of Des Moines. and Donald
Reid of Osceola. They will speak in
the order named.

The proposition under discussion in
the Belcit clash. is “Resolved, that
there be a single department 0: na-
tional defense and under it a depart-
ment of army. of navy, and depnrtmcnt
of areonautics as advocated by Col.
William Mitchell." The Grinnell team
will uphold the negative side of the
Question.

The work of the past week has been

mainly a d ill in the fundamentals of,

dcbate work. but real practice will
bcgiu next Monday with a scrimmage
debate between the [r-eshnrau team
and a team composcd of Randolph Hce
witt. John Fierscu, and James Work.
who are planning to debate the same
question with South Dakota here on
March 10. The latter team is really
working on the negative side of the
question too. but have changed to the
aflirmative for Monday to give the
yearling team a good work out .
This is the first freshman inter-col-
lcgiate debate that Grinncll has par—
ticipated in for several years.

blasted all hopes for Oklahoma by
bcating the Sooner-s. 29 to 21. With
only two more games left on their-
cantcronce schedule. Nebraska to-
night, and Kansas Aggies Mondav. the
\llcu-lnen should be able to annex
the pennant. ‘

Oklahoma is playing good ball and
to date has lost only to Kansas. But
as the Jaylrawkcrs have two extra
games on their list. all hopes for a
Sooner pennant are gone. Tho south-
crners have showed some good backct-
ball and have a couple or men near
the top in the scoring column, It
will be difficult to displace the 01(1th
lrcma U. name from second place.

Aggiea Play Fewest Games

The Kansas Aggies have played less
games so far than any other member-
or the conference. and the coming
week will see their twelvergame
schedule finished. They have yet to
play Kansas. Amos and Grinnell. The
Aggies-have been led all year by the
midget Byers and the Sky—scraping
Tebow. This pair has been largely
responsible for the success of their-
team and by keeping up the good
work have an outside chance to fin-
islr second.

Nebraska has been puffing along in
fourth place. and will play toniglrtior
the ﬁrst time in eight days. Their
opponent tonight is Kansas and the
Cornbnskers may be just good enough
to down their supcriors. Next week
they meet Drake-and make their Cur-
Lain call with Missouri.

Washington unexpectedly dropped a
game to Boelter's Bulldog-s last night
and are now tied with h , our-i for

and as the Bears are minus the serv-
iccs of two stars, Seago and Stanford.
the Cyclones may turn in another win.

Missouri is up in Iowa looking for
grapes and have so tar found Arncs
easy picking. ‘Tonight they will tauglo
with the lighting Drake outfit in a
game that is fairly even on paper.
Next week the Columbians will play
three games and then turn in their
suits for the season.

Oklahoma Aggies have suilered a
rncteorical fall irom the "Oklahoma
clztss' 'zind are now catching their
breath in a tie with Drake. In justice
to tho Farmers it must be said that
their first year in the conference has
been most auspicious and had they
been able to keep up the pace they
would now be in the "son" class. In
Peary they have one of the best for
wards in the Valley, who has played
consistently all season. He is close
to the top in scoring honor-s.

The Scar-let and Black squad will
enjoy a good rest beiore they tangle
with their old rivals next week and
the men ought to be in the pink of

makings of a good team and should-be
winning more games. In their prey—
ious contest with the Blue and white,
they outplayed Drake a good share of
the time, while in the first half of the
Ames game they played in big league
style. If Captain wing and his men
get to hitting the basket consistently
and display some or the old Grinnell
fight. the Piuncei's will have an excel—
