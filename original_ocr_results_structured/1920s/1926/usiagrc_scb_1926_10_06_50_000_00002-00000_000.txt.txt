Grinnell students and faculty members are either too
modest and bashful or are unaware that the Scarlet and
Black maintains it “VVhtIi. do YD“ think" column for their
ideas and suggestions.

We doubt the presumption that our cullege is a new

Bugle,” or something to that eiicct. About once each

athletic season it u

customary to break lccsc with a,
lengthy, soggy editorial, lamenting; the pliable school
spirit and iippcaliug i‘o the liner 'il'tuus or loyaliti; cour—
agc, chivalry, courtesy, iair niindcdncss and the lilies
all tor the glory or old nahrah.

u'c didirt suppose at that time, that colleges had to
resort to such nicuus. We supposed that college students
had outgrown that period, that colleges with their ia-
iuous yells lino real athletic teams; were grndiiotc schools
in the liclds oi school spirit and pop,

Maybe we have changed our minds; we are not real
sure. The "Beat Simpson" pep dcucc last weekend was,
it wonderiul dance, but as a pep meeting the aiiair wasl
one sad sight ior sore eyes. While tllree speakers grwe
snort pep talks, the majority oi the crowd had neither,
the courtesy nor the spirit to give any attention. Thc‘
yelling at the grime Saturday was llliserilhle. About hall
the strident hotly knew the yells.

The pop committee is doing its best hut nothing can
hc accomplished ii the student. hody lacks the attitude.
Since the home schcdulc is already onertllil‘d completcd,
might we suggest that some or the ”strongerrluuged”
members or thc student body take the trouble to spare
two wholc minutes some day this wcclr, learning one or
possihly twc Grinnell yells.
