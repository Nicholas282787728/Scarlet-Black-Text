dent of Czechoslovak , is the foremost
man in the central republics today.

profs or of applied chi stizlllity, who
, spent the past suunner in Europe gath-
orinc material for a biography of 'the
Czecho-Slovnk leader ,

Under President . aryk, Czechoe
slovakia is enjoying the most ordered
development and the gi itest pres-
tige or any of the republics that rose

Career liikt- Lincoln’s

"President M: ill t‘s career may he‘

was born of humble pl ent. in a tiny

Steiner. At on em age, he wn ap-
prenticod to a blacksmith, but his
parents had gi ntci- ambitions ior him,
and be st sent to the public school,
l-‘roni there, he went to the Unucrsity,
where he earned his way by tutoring
his classmates. possessed of mi unu

tirele. ly and fearlessly, rapidly be—
coming a leader at the liberals in his
count The Ans ian government
hated and feared his influence so
much that he was forced to lice with
a price on his head. He went toEnga
land, Russ , and America, where he
labored for the destruction of the AuSr
trinn monarchy and the attainment of
Czechoslovak independence. His oom-
patriots living abroad, supponed his
cause enthusiastically. When Czecho—

slovak independence was recognized in
October, 1918, Professor Masaryk was
recalled, and unanimously elected first
president of the new republic. Since
that time Czechoslovakia has prosper-
ed undei the leadership of its philoso-
hirer-president.
Had No Mutt-rial
As no account of President Mos-
arvk's life had been written, Dr. Stein—
cr \ is forced to find his own sources

to se ral interviews with ‘the mesh

many people who had known his

ed, siv iormer classmates ot the pro

Dr. Steiner is particularly interested
