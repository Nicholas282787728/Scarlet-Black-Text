When the reporter interviewed Mr.
Theodore H Post, instructor in the
School of Music, a very interesting
comparison at Grinnell with eastein
schools was secured. “Grillnell,” said
Mr. Post, “is an ideal combination of

_ the co-education institutions or the
I ‘ middle west and the men’s and Worn-
I‘en’s colleges or the east. Here you

I.- ihavo all the advantages of co educa-

tion and still retain tho tcatuic of

Post and 1 like the size or the town,
like the students, and are linding the

cludod. "Your chapel and vesper ser-

Mr. J. M. Bridgham, Plolessor or

Mi». 0, G. Eulim ol the Economics

campus and over the whole town, fol-

MY. Eubank said, "I like the spirit

on pay day, I can only say that my im-
pressions are nothing hll'tithe very
