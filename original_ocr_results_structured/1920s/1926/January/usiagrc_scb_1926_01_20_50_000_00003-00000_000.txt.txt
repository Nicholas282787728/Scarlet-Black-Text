that in such work, the studelit is

Race Problem Reopened
In Student Federation

More serious difficulty is lacing the
National Student Federation (oi-med
at Princeton since the University oi
‘Virginia delegate has stated that the
election of a negro student to the com»
mittee will bring Iorth protest from
the southern schools.

The dissatisfaction over the selec-
tion of bliss Mabel Holloway, a negro
girl, was apparently notvgreatly leSr
hunted by the compromise which pro-
vides for the choosing of two dele-
gates from each national section. thus
enabling Louisiana, the originally ot~
fended state, to have a white delegate
in addition to Miss Holloway.‘

The Louisiana State university dele-
gate, Roland Kizer explained to the
president cl L. S. U. why he withdrew
from the conference. President T. D.
Boyd approved his action and assured
him that the university was behind
him.
