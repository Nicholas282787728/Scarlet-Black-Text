The largest edition or the Malteaser
which has been published during the
seven years of that publication's exe
istence, went on sale Tuesday ere-
ning. Twenty-tour of the sisty pages
in the magazine comprise a review or
Grinllell athletics, past and present,
while there are the customary thirty-
six pages or humor.

The mechanical processes involveill
in the publication or this record-
breaking issue taxed the capacity of
the Grnn ell Herald print-
ing plant to such an extent that it was
impossible to get the Malteaser into
the ma s during vacation. During
the two weeks that college was not
in session. all the ion printing re-
sources or the Herald were concen»
trated on Malteitser work. This edite
ion is larger than that of the current
issue or any other college or uuivcn
