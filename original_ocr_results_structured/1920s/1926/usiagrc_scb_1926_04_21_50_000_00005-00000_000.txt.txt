Repeating the tremendous conicd)‘
success of 1345, the faculty revival of
“Fashion—hr Life in New York,"
Thursday night ill. the Cololllal Tllea~
tre, reiezlled histroilic aliil esllithcrr
to unsuspected by students or 001*
leagues. Instead ol postslliscli proll<
lends or tlle sopliisticlitioils of Tu‘en-
ticth Century Broildll'iiy, the filillience
was delighted with that one ‘touch of
platilnde which makes the whole
world kill. The Villain tiiirled his
black moustache and white-rohed I“,
noccncc snlfci-cd through foul acts of
theatrical tribulation to receive the
conventional rewards of Virtue and an
al'niilll of flowers before the end of
the fifth that.

No since the days when 1 used to
witness the thrillers ol tank-drama. in
'their native habitat have I seen VirA
tue so conspicuously rewarded or Vice
so properly punished. And when be-
tween the acts the players canie be-
fore the curtain to be cheered or hissed
in accordance with the canons of per
etic justice, the naturltl inclinations
of the audience burst forth spontane-
ously and vociferously. 1 have not
had so much tun at the theatre since
I saw “NellieY the Beautiful Cloak
Model."

Bccin Oozcs Sentiment

The "Distribution of Characters”
could not have been bettered. Ir.
Beem in stage whiskers and cow. lde
boots silnply oozed moral sentiment,
He was Adam Trueman to the life,
When he sang “Be Kind to the Old
Folks at Home," freshmen resolved to
mend their ways.

l\liss Anderson as the fashionable
.Mrs. Tiffany, was provincial dignity
incarnate. She played a ditficolt role
With distinction, and kept the audience
laughing at her Americanized French.
Mr. Faguy—Cotc fairly outdiu himself
as the pseudo-Count Jolimnitre. His
song, “Rosalie,” was one of the big
successes of the evening.

Mr. Card has announced that tho
committoee in charge or the Sophos

veral of the prominent high schools

The Honor G club, sponsor of the

the state. The athletes will he enters

With the arrival of the trophies at
Doc Huff’s office, nnother wrinkle is
erased from the brow ot the chairman
of the meet committee. As the orders
were placed late for the cups and
medals, there was a slight chance that
the awards would arrive late for the
most. A large cup, 16 inches high, s
to be awarded to the school compiling
the most points in the meet; two cups
each 10 inches in height are to be gi-
ven to the teams winning the half

lllces Rise (If Englisli’Or‘Jtor)‘ From
Beomllf to Present Dllr.

Professor Paul Spencer \Voud spoke
to the Grinnell Forensic lust VVednes-
dity night in the club room of Build—
ing Four on “English Oratory." This
Was the sixth of a. series of lectures
on foreign oratol‘s; the others were
given by Professor Edward B. T. Spen~
cer, Professor C. N. Smiley, Mr. H. J.
Thornton, Dean John S. Nollell, and
Professor R. H, Pcrring.

Professor Wood traced the English
orators from the beginning when they
were but mythical beings created by
Beowulf lo the crowning peak of Edge
lish oratory in the eighteenth ’cens
till-y, Unlike most countries, England
has not had to depend on a national
crisis to bring forth men of ability
but there has been an evolutionary
process of developing oratoi-s of note
until Edmond Burke represents the
peak or the utopia or oratory. r

L yd George Is Example

Thrall h- the eighteenth century
men of note rollowcd Burke. They
were William Pitt, the younger, and
William Pitt, the elder, Gladstone. and
Charles Joseph Fox. Orators of abil-
ity did not necessarily Stop with these
men for Lloyd George is today an out—
standing orator of world fame.

in the latter part of his discussion,
Professor Wood took the subicctuf do.
hate in America rind compared it to
that in England. He spoke of the in~
fluence that the debaters union of
Cambridge and Oxford had on the pole
iticnl issues of the time, Unlike Am-
erican ways, the English debaters
were earnest and sincere in taking up
vital issues before huge audiences
which listened With the greatest re—
spect. Their Words Were less en'lr
bellished and their style was more
free.

May Expect More Guitars

Another great step that England has
taken in forging ahead of the United
States is that of the close relationship
of political and religions oratory. The
two are inseparable in England and
the sermons are better spoken and
better written because there is a great
living truth to discuss, We are
prone to rely on the sermons of the
old school. In conclusion, professor
Wood said that since English orators
are evolving, we might expect any
number of future orators from that

l‘rafcssor Lop‘dcn D‘ cusses Great-
ness of Shakespeare ill Chapel.

“The really great books are those
to which we may return with fresh
pleasure, and be re-cnchantcd by their
tales," said Professor Eleanor Low-
den in her chapel talk Thursday mar»
hing, commemorating the birth of
William Shakespeare.

v ility in Shakespeare

Just what is it which makes
this charm in Shakespeare, we can not
tell, but we do know that there is a
throh of \itallty, the very feeling of
life itseld "Tolstoy." the speaker con—
tinued, "once said that Shakespeare
was done for so far a s presentation
on the stage was concerned, but this
statement was disproved by a cams
pauy of Russian players, who met
with great success before the peasant
folk of that country.

"in our lives wer are liable to miss
some of the richness and fullness of
life because we are too much occupied
with the little things. By reading
Shakespeare, we may find much with
which to supplement our lives. Cole-
ridge, who said that he could repro-
duce the work of the great poets so
closely that no difference could be dee
tested by comparison, tailed somehow
to get the subtle charm of the master
when it came to reproducing Shake-
spears,

Johnson Valued Shakespeare

“Ally child who is acquainted with
Shakespeare from an early age." con-
tiuued Miss Lowden, “is not likely to
yield to the trashy literature of the
day." Although Ben Jonson, one of
Shakespeal 's most sympathetic crit~
ics, has said that the dramatist knew
"little Latin and less Greek," he also
said of him that he equalled the class-
ics and at times even surpassed them.

in conclusion Professor Lowdcn
urged that everyone should read
Shakespeare for beauty which he re-
vealed in lire.

Flil'ulel' Judge Does not Question inc
Organiz: ion ltight of Labor.

“My quarrel is not with the right
or labor to organize," dcclarcd Judge
w. P. Huggins, chiel counsel or the
League of industrial Rights and ion
mcr- judge of the Kansas Industrial
Court, last night in Herrick chapel, “I
really think the laborers ought to or»
gauize. But I do think that they
should observe the rights of others and
he governed by the law of the land.”

Courts Arc Necessary

Speaking on the suhjct, “The basis
ol organized iabor's opposition to the
courts," Judge Huggins first brought
out that courts are an absolute neces-
sity in any country having a free dem-
ocratic government, and that ever
since the time of Moses, the court
method has been the system of Sets
tling disputes.

According to Mr. Huggins, organiz—
cd labor’s antagonism toward the
courts is a result of a number of des
feats which it has sul‘lered in the
hands of the supreme court in past
cases. To substitute this View, he
cited five cases, in which each one
ended in the defeat of the labor ele.
ment and consequently resulted
the opposition of this element to the
courts. The cases he cited were: the
Debbs Case, which had to do with the
famous Pullman strike; the Danberry
Hatters Case, which concerned the
closed shop principle; the Duplex
Printing Case, another closed shop sit—
uation; the Coronado Coal Case; and
the Daugherty injunction Case.

has Wrong Effect

Ho asserted that every strike of a
serious nature eventually has become
an attack against the people instead
of a private affair between labor and
capital.

After the address nlr. Huggins an-
swered questions and several problems
were discussed in open forum style,

“Our most dangerous foos arc the
sensclcss and silly customs and tra-
ditions which we allow to s angle in-
(ll dualitics," said Professor H w.
bor s in his talk at Senior chapcl Fri-
dlly morning. ”Liberty and tolerance

"Eiery college ought to have, most

thought and behavior." Although
these men very often are mnstcr-
minds, they .u-e usually the butt of
ridicule," Professor burr-is told of men
with whom he had become acquainted
in his college days and also as a pr
lessor. Many of them were absent»
minded, eccentric, but men of visions
"men whose feet are on earth but
whose hoods -c in the clouds. They
refuse to be the retailers of tradition,
They discovcr new truths because
they are unhampsved by the old.

”I am very much concerned about
the young man who in his freshman
year makes an unusual display of uri-
sinality. He is apt to have his origin-
ality prepped out of him his first year.

"I favur a fund for the encourage— ’
ment of the gfted student—in any line
—eyen to sending him to other insti-
tntions. We are not here to glorify
Grinnell; we are here to enrich life.”

Advocates Training ilui‘es

Training rules for scholars, the
same as training rules for athletes,
were advocated by Professor Norris in
condemning the over-hurdening of a
capable man with outside activities.
He declared that the call is for thor-
ough training and sacrifice. “The
gifted soul must not be allowed to
dissipate bis energies on the frivoiitics
of life, '
