Gl-innell will decline the invitation
of Brown universi y, undefeated east-
ern team, to engage in an intercollegl»
ate football contest next )ear, it was
voted at a recent meeting of the lac-
ulty athletics committee, No special
reasons were stated, but it is thought
that the game would interfere with
Gl'iullell’s Missouri Valley schedule.

Several days ago the Pioneer ath-
letic heads received a telegram from
the Providence school offering agarne
to Grinncll on either oi three dates in
October. One loss out of seven games
played on the Pioneer schedule prob-
ably accounts tor the offer.

It is estimated that the cost of the

Girls About‘Prayers

Miss Luella J. Read, dean or wo-

c. A. meeting on the subject".Prl1yer.”
The meeting was in recugnitiuh of Na-
tional Prayer week as fl. part of the
World Fellowship movement.
. Miss Read characterized prayer not
as a thing expressed in words. nor in
thoughts, but in it kind of spiritual ups
lift gained by contact with the finer
things of life. The old conclmtions of
prayer, as a petition, a confession,

having only in part the real qualificeh
tions of prayer.

"Prayer is aspiration, and the
piratlon which results in doing. The
desire to he something higher and
filler, the desire to have a part ill 2L0-
complishment, and this desire express
ed in words is real prayer in the
sense which We can best understand
it."

with a successful football season
drawing to a close, Pioneer basket-
ball men are preparing lur a strenu-
ous season at the cage sport.

Faclng a strong schedule of sixteen
games, Cotich Hayes expects to bring
the Pioneers through the season with
a good record. The season opens at
Omaha on December 18 against the
Creighton hluojays, leaders in the
North Central conference. From then
on all the teams played will he mem—
bers of the Missouri Valley group.

Seven letter men will furnish the
nucleus 'lor a strong squad. There
are some promising reserves from last
year and a likely bunch of sophomores
who have plenty of class and should
furnish some fast competition.

Tlle iorward material includes three
letter men, Doffing, Lamb and Chase
besides Smiley, Gray, McCully and In—
gram, all of whom must‘he reckoned
with Davis. letter man at center, will
find some competition worth watching
in Niblo, another letter nran. and
Sceland. Peterson and Mark are the
two letter men at guard. )vihlo also
has played at that position and Hays.
Fall and coggcsball are expected to
make their presence known in no on-
certain tcrm ,

A number or the candidates have
been working out regularly although
regular practices have not, yet begun.
Several ot the men are playing (note
ball and will be available attire end ot

With the close of the spcedhall sear

the dl'trtlorlli teams. Realizing that
fcw choices will suit anybody and no
choiccs everybody, the writer has
madc an effort to pick such players as

made to take into consideration eflcrt

places on the two teams. The Six
team was composed of a group of

era which included in its memr

hip several roal star-s. men who
have had several years or experience
in the game. Coggcshall and Chase,
from the championship team, are
placed at tor-wards on the Scarlet and
Black all-team, because of their all-
around offensive and delensive play
throughout the season. Both men were
very adept at passrtossing and re-
ceiving, one of the strong points of
their team's play. These two men
were closely pressed by Beck and
Patton of Clark hall, and Peterson,
the leader of the Building Three team,
which rolled into second place in the
ratings. These men, especially Peters
son, were excellent kickers, and the
progress made by tlrclr teams is in a
good measure traceable to their work.

With the most important game on
the Pioneers schedule. the Thanksgiv—
ing day game with the Drake Bulldogs,
only tour practiccs away, the Grluuell
coaching force is focusing its attention
on properly tapering the drills of the
team, ,

Coach Hylarrd is blessed tor once
tlus season, by having the entire squad
in good condition. The iniury recelVr
cd by Arden McClain in the Kansas en—
gascmcnt has travelled on to the home
of all good injuries, and McClain is‘
again cavorting at his old quarterback
berth, Stotts reminded the boys or
the Penn and Simpson games last
night in practice as be pcrtormed his
old wiles upon the trcshman aggrega—
tion in a short scrimmage.

\ ill‘ Surcat-s Froslr

’l‘llls -crimmage took the form of a
test agai st the Drake style or or
tense. The Frnsh were able to'ypush
down the field for several counters in
the first row minrrtcs of the practice,
but from then on the play was all for-
the varsity, who smear-ed ,with the ut—
most abandon the shift plays that
Drake is purported to use.

The Bulldogs feature an offense
that has as its cbicl article at decep—
tion, a number of plays in which sev-
eral shifts are used. Such an oifense
was used to good effect upon Iowa by
the Minnesota Gophers at the Iowa
homecoming game several weeks ago.
These plays are nearly all centered
around “Chuck” Everett, and it will be
one of the chief aims of the Pioneer
team to stop this clever ball carrier.

Everett has been ably assisted in ads
vancing the ball by Bill Cook, the
Bulldog's best bet at fullback, and
Sutherland, a hard running 'halt back.
and a good forward passer. Many
passes from Sutherland to Everett
have been good for considerable gains,
and Griunell expects to face not a lit—
tle 01 this type of barrage in Des
Moines next week. ,

Drake Battles Non-c Dnrue

Drake tackled Notre Dame today at
South Band. The result of that game
will have a little to do with the way
the betting public would wager on the
Grinnell contest. Drake entered as the
underdog, and may have sprung a few
”Sleepers” to surprise the Irish. Re—
ports irom the Rockne camp seem to
indicate that the Bulldogs bite isn’t
considered very dangerous. A game
of this type may reap several harvests
from the Drake supply of gmid per—
Farmers. and on the other band it may
give them a little needed confidence.
Dr-akc probably realizes that the Blue
and White has had sway over the Pio—
neer teams for a length of time that
isn't by any means short, and will
run up against one of their toughest
customers in the Turkey Day battle.
