Twenty-rive million penny Christmas
seals are heius distrihuted by the Iowa
Tulicrcniosis Association throughout
every county in the stnte, The Nine-
teenth Annual Christmas seal cam-
paign theiuls from Thanksgiving to
Christmas.
....Tiie proceeds oi the seal sale are
used by the 10%! public health asses
cistions in various iornls of childl
health work. nursing, health ethics-l
ticn, school health supplies, fresh air
camps. clinics, etc. and a portion by}
the State Association in the preven-
tion at tuberculosis both in humane
and animals, for the reduction or heart
disease and in general health work.
In the nineteen years during which
the money raised by the seal sale has
heen used in preventing disease and
promoting health the tuberculosis
death rate has been reduced titty-ﬁve-
per cent, intent ninrtsiity twenty per
cent. and the general death rate ten
per cent.
Within the past year lows shifted
ircin sixth to third place in the race oi
states having the lowest tuberculosis
death rate, being exceeded now in
licztlthl'ulncss only by Nebraska. and
Utah. The State‘s death rate was re

gain in the country at large.

The color scheme of thiﬁ year's seal
reverts to that su pupular two years
ago, namely a. rich red, deep hiue and
gold. The design features three min-
streis heralding a hsppy Christmas
and a. healthy New Year.
