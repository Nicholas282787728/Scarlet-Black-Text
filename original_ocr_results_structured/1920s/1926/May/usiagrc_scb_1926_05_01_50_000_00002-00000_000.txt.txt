Malteaser Will'Make
Final Bow on May 18

'l‘he alalteaser will appear on the
campus May 15 111 a big final issue
that is ‘chuch-rnll' oi humor and wit,
to successfully close the eighth year
of its existanre. As the present editor
and business mnnager'ccnlplete their
term, the magazine shows improve-
ment and increase in bath circuhr
lion and advertising.

The llaltcuser is sponsored by the
local chapters of Sigma Delta Chi
and Theta Sigma Phi. Grinnell is one
or the very rew liberal arts
colleges to publish 11 humor
magazine ol the reputation the
Malteaser heal-s. Whether it
is true that the name was taken from
Griunell's lamous “Campus Kitty."
the sarety coach which on s hetwecn
crinnell and Newton hears the name
or Malteuser, and the famous bar by
that name is also considered a close
relative of the original Grinnell Muir
teaser.

The llalteaser has consistently had
more and better humor in its issues
this year. Every issue has colltdined
thi1 y or more pages. An added tea-
ture that has hcen given the readers
is the tl‘ircolorcd cover drawn 11y a
nrctcsslohal artist. This in itseil is a
teaturc that few ot the larger lluivel‘»
